To the much Honored EDWARD SAYER, Of the Middle Temple, Esquire;
SIR,
A Dedication, from its frequent usage, is now grown, as it were, so absolutely
necessary, that a Book without One, may be said to be much in the same
Circumstances as a Child without a Parent to own it, or at least a Godfather to
answer for it: A Prescription for it may be pleaded beyond the Era of
Printing, even from the first use of Letters, and the very Infancy of Learning:
This may Warrant it in general, but my own many Obligations exact this public
way in particular of expressing my grateful acknowledgments to you; which I
must confess, nevertheless are at best, but a very unsuitable and indifferent
Retribution.

I shall say little here in relation to this Alien, which I have ventured to
Naturalize; nor of you whom I have chose to Patronize it. I am sensible, a true
Gentleman bates a nauseous piece of Flattery, and would not much care for a
Recital even of those modest Encomium's he is known to deserve. If he may merit
your Esteem, and the Book's Commendations may balance its Errors it will be a
sufficient Recompense and Satisfaction to the Translator.

Such as it is, I have ventured to submit it to Censure, requesting your
Protection and Patronage, which favor will strictly engage me to be in the
highest regard,

Honored Sir, Your most Obliged, and most Humble Servant, C. B.
Feb. 6. 169^.
THE PREFACE.
MEeting, sometime since, with this Book in Latin, I thought it well worth my
Money, did it but answer its Title Page; and finding my self, upon the Perusal,
not much disappointed, I resolved to turn it into English, for the benefit of
such as might not, perhaps, understand the Latin; and yet be no less curious
than my self to be Informed of the Matters contained therein: Since, by being
Instructed in the Genealogies, the Matches, the Increments, and the Decrements
of all the Families in Europe; together with the many Pretenses that arise from
thence, which is chiefly the Subject of the ensuing Discourse, they will, (in
all probability) be the better enabled to judge of the different Interests
which have engaged almost all the Princes of Europe in a War, the Event whereof
so much concerns this Nation, and consequently, is the general Topic of
Discourse.

I shall not here pretend to give an Account of the many Advantages which may
be drawn from the Knowledge of History; and how necessary a Qualification it is
for a Gentleman, since to say all One ought on that subject, would swell this
Preface to a Bulk, disproportionate to the Treatise it self, which pretends to
no more than a Compendium.

Yet, since it is probable the Reader would gladly know somewhat of the Author
thereof; the best account that can be given of him is from Himself and Book. In
order to which, he lets you know, in his Epistle Dedicatory, That he is a
Professor in the University at Franckfort, and that the Book was the first
Fruits of his Office; It having been read as Lectures, or a Compendious
Introduction to the Genealogy and History of the present Princes of Europe, for
the benefit of the Students there, and since Printed, to be rendered more
publicly useful. The Method he has taken herein is Easy and Plain; the
Genealogical Observations are exact; and the Historical as full of Matter as
the nature of his design would bear: Not but that having labored in a Soil,
capable of mighty Improvements, as to the last, if this first Impression find
that kind Reception as may be expected, it may encourage the Translator, or
some Other, to resume the Work; and by engrafting on his Stock, bring the
Growth to a greater Perfection; an Essay whereof you already have in the
English House.

In the mean time, the Book, as it now stands, is of good Use, and may merit a
favorable Reception, as well from the most Learned, as from the Ignorant: For
although the former may be supposed to be already acquainted with what is
contained herein, yet it will always serve them as a Summary or Common Place.
And though the latter will not be rendered thorough-paced Historians hereby, yet
will it give them a general Insight into the modern Story of Europe, together
with a curiosity of being farther Informed.

There is one thing more, I thought fit to acquaint the Reader withal, which
is, That in the Latin Copy, amongst King James the Second's Children, there is
one mentioned and called, The Prince of Wales; but the late Licenser, Mr.
Bohun, having expunged Him, the Translator could not, by the Warrant of the
Latin Original, presume to insert Him.

OBSERVATIONS Historical and Genealogical.
CHAP. I. Of the Genealogy of the House of Austria.
. I. BEing to give a Genealogical Account of all the Sovereign Princes now
flourishing in Europe, 'twill be but just to begin with the House of Austria,
as being of the First Dignity: Which as it owes its Original without doubt, to
the Earls of Habsburg; so in tracing the Pedigree of those Earls, most
Genealogists are at a loss. As for us, we shall not doubt to derive 'em from
the Counts of Mont-Aventine, of the Anician Perleonian Family, which was
formerly of the greatest Repute and Authority of any in Rome; and had its Seat
on Mont-Aventine, being chiefly induced thereunto by the Arguments used by Pet.
Lambechius, in his Comment. de Biblioth. Caesar. lib. 2. c. 6. In the Twelfth
Century there flourished in this Family, one Leo Anicius Perleonius, Count of
Mont-Aventine, whose Epitaph may be read in Cardinal Baronius's Ecclesiastical
Annals, ad Annum MC XL. He was descended in a direct Line from the Emperor
Flavius Anicius Olybrius; and in the Title to his Epitaph, is styled, The most
Noble of the Romans. His Son was Peter Leo Anicius Perleonius, Count of
Mont-Aventine; whose Epitaph may be likewise found in the same Ecclesiastical
Annals, Tom. 12. ad Annum MC XLIV. This Peter begat leo Maximus Anicius
Perleonius, who died in 1162. witness his Epitaph, which may be seen to this
day before St. Alexius his Church on Mont-Aventine in Rome, and is recited by
Arnoldus Wion, in the First Part of his Lignum Vitae, sive Histor. Ord.
Benedict. as likewise by Johan. Seifrid Abbot of Wethalen, in his Arbor
Aniciana, lib. 1. c. 8. His Son was Albertus Dives Anicius Perleonius, who was
driven out of Rome in 1144. by the Arnaldastick Heretics, together with his
Brother Rudolph, in defense of the Roman See; whereupon he traveled into
Switzerland, and there married the Daughter of Wernerus, last Earl of Habsburg,
of the Family of Altenburg; and by that means became the first Earl of
Habsburg, of the Anician Perleonian Race: See Abbot Seifrid. Loc. Cit. c. 12.
and lib. 3. Epist. Dedicator. Whence this Wernerus drew his Extraction, the
brevity of our present Design will not permit us to discourse; those that would
be informed in that particular, may consult, amongst others, the famous Philip
James Spenerus, in his Oper. Herald. lib. 1. c. 9.. 62. It Is sufficient for us
to know, that Albertus Dives Anicius, was great Grandfather to Rudolph, the
fourth Earl of Habsburg, and first German Emperor of the Anician Perleonian
Family: See the Patent of the Emperor Rudolph, published and cited by John
Stumphius, in his Hist. Helv. lib. 7. c. 12. His Father was Albert, surnamed
The Wise, Earl of Habsburg; his Mother, Hedewig Countess of Kyburn; and his
Grandfather, Rudolph, surnamed The Silent, Son of Albertus Dives Anicius
Perleonius Earl of Habsburg.

. II. Rudolph the First, whom we shall here set down as the Common Father of
the House of Austria, was born May 1. 1218. and brought up in the Court of the
Emperor Frederick the Second: Afterward made Lord High Marshall, in the
Court of Ottocar King of Bohemia. Returning home, he entered on the Government
of his own Hereditary Provinces, and had frequent Wars with his Neighbors. In
1273. he was chosen Emperor, by the unanimous Consent of the Princes of the
Empire, and Crowned the same Year at Aix la Chappelle: But when Ottocar King of
Bohemia refused him Homage, he had a sharp War with him to force him to it.
Moreover, he freed Germany from Robbers; had Austria settled on his eldest Son
Albert, and Schwaben on Rudolph, in 1282. at a Diet then held at Ausburg;
introduced the use of the Teutonick, both in public Acts and private
Contracts; alienated the Cities of Florence, Genoua, and Luca, from the Empire,
and declared 'em Free States: And last of all, ended his Days at Germershelm,
July 15. 1291. having had fifteen Children by his Empress Anne, who was
Daughter to the Earl of Hohenberg. The Daughters were 1. Jutta, married to
Wenceslaus King of Bobemia and Poland; deceased 1292. 2. Clementia, to Charles
Martell King of Hungary; deceased 1295. 3. Maud, to Lewis Elector Palatine;
deceased 1304. 4. Margaret, to Diderick Earl of Cleves; by some omitted. 5.
Agnes, to Albert the second Duke of Saxony; deceased 1311. 6. Hedewig, to Otho
Marquess of Brandenburg; deceased 1303. 7. Catharine, to Otho Duke of Bavaria;
deceased 1285. And, 8. Euphemia, a professed Nun in the Austrian Covent, at
Tolne.


Of the Male Issue, only three lived to be Men; viz.

1. Albert the First, Archduke of Austria, born July 29. 1242. of whom more in
the next Section. 2. Hartmanus, a Prince of excellent Endowments, but lost in
passing the Rhine, as he was going to meet his Father, in the 18th Year of his
A^e, An. 1280. 3. Rudolph the Second, Duke of Schwaben, who married Agnes,
Daughter of Ottocar King of Bohemia, on whom he begot a posthumous Son, named
John; who proved afterward the Murderer of his Uncle Albert the Emperor; for
which he was thrust into a Monastery, where he died, in 1313.
. III. Thus we see how Albert the First, surnamed Monoculus, from his having
but one Eye, the other being lost by Poison in his youth, was the only
Propagator of the Austrian Race; who having vanquished the Emperor, Adolph of
Nassau, set the Imperial Diadem on his own Head. He had likewise good success
in his Wars with the Electors of the Rhine. His Empress was Elizabeth, the Duke
of Carinthia and Earl of Tyrol and Goritia's Daughter, who bore him one and
twenty Children: Nevertheless he came to an unnatural Death, in the height of
his Felicity, being killed by his Nephew John, May 1. 1308. His Issue that
survived, were 1. Agnes, married to Andrew the third King of Hungary, 1296.
deceased 1364. 2. Elizabeth, married to Fredereck the third Duke of Lorrain, in
1312. deceased 1353. being the Mother of six and twenty Children. 3. Anne,
married to Hermannus Marquess of Brandenburg; and after his decease, to Henry
the sixth Duke of Breslaw: She died 1361. 4. Catharine, espoused by the
Emperor Henry of Luxenburg; but he being poisoned in Iraly by a Monk, she was
afterward married to Charles Duke of Calabria, Heir apparent to the Kingdom of
Naples; and departed this life in 1324. 5. Gutta, married to Lewis the seventh
Earl of Oetingen in Schwaben; deceased 1328. 6. Rudolph, elected King of
Bohemia; but died an untimely death, and without Issue, An. 1307. 7. Frederick
the Fair, elected Emperor in 1314. and Crowned by the Elector of Cologne:
Nevertheless, making War upon Lewis of Bavaria, who pretended to the same
Dignity, he was defeated ( An. 1324.) and imprisoned by him for the space of
three Years; and then not set at liberty, but on condition he should renounce
all Pretensions to the Imperial Authority, retaining only the Title. He
departed this life without Male Issue, in the Year 1330. 8. Leopold the First,
Duke of Schwaben, Landtgrave of Alsace, Earl of Tyrol, etc. He attempted his
Brother Frederick's releasment by Magic; but in vain. He began a War with the
Swiss, but was likewise unsuccessful in that. His Duchess was Isabel, Daughter
to Amadeus Duke of Savoy, by whom he had only Daughters, 9. Henry, surnamed The
Mild, deceased without Issue Male, in the Year 1327. having, in this the same
fate with Frederick and Leopold. 10. Otho Duke of Stiria, styled The Delight of
his Subjects; who had two Wives, and by them two Sons; but both died in their
Infancy. And, 11. Albert, surnamed The Wise, in whose Issue alone the Austrian
Family was preserved.


. IV. This Albert, quitting his Cloister, married the Lady Joan, sole Heiress
to the Earldom of Pfirte: He likewise founded St. Stephen's Church at Vienna,
and departed this life in the Year 1338. leaving Issue, 1. Margaret, married to
Mienhard Earl of Tyrol; and after his decease, to Otho Marquess of Brandenburg.
2. Agnes, to Henry the second Duke of Silesia. 3. Catharine, professed a Nun.
4. Frederick the Second, killed by a chance Shot a Hunting, An. 1362. 5.
Rudolph the Fourth, deceased likewise without Issue. 6. Albert the Third, and
last of all. 7. Leopold the Second, of whom more in the next Section.


Albert the Third, in the Division of his Father's Inheritance 'twixt him and
his Brother Leopold, had Austria, Stiria, and Carinthia for his Lot; in which
he was succeeded by his Son

Albert the Fourth, surnamed The Patient; who by Joan Daughter of Albert Duke
of Bavaria, had

Albert he Fifth, a very fortunate Prince; who (not to mention his excellent
Endowments of Mind) was, in the space of one Year, inaugurated in the Bohemian,
Hungarian, and Imperial Crowns, An. 1438. before which, the Marquisate of
Moravia had been given him in Dowry with his Wife Elizabeth, Daughter to the
Emperor Sigismund, whom he succeeded in the Empire, by the Name of Albert the
Second. He was imbroil'd in a War with the Hussites. Moreover, he undertook an
Expedition against the Turks, to put a stop to their Inroads into Hungary; but
was prevented by Death (which seized him in his Camp) and lies buried at Alba
Regalis. After his death, the Empress was brought to bed of a posthumous Son,
named Uladislaus, who succeed him in the Kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary; but
died likewise an untimely Death, in 1457. in the seventeenth Year of his Age.

. V. Look we back therefore to Leopold the Second, who in the division of Lands
abovementioned, 'twixt his Brother and him, obtained Schwaben and Alsace. He
had sharp Wars with the Swiss, by whom his Army was routed, and himself slain,
at the Battle of Sempach, An. 1386. His four Sons were, 1. William, a Prince of
great Courage; deceased Childless, 1406. 2. Leopold the Third, who had the same
fate with his Brother, though married to Carathine Daughter of Philip the Bald,
Duke of Burgundy. 3. Frederick the Third, who labored under many Hardships, by
reason of Pope John the Two and twentieth: Upon whose account he was
excommunicated by the Council of Constance, and proscribed and outed of all his
Territories, by the Emperor Sigismund. Nevertheless, being again received to
Grace, he was re-invested in the Counties of Tyrol and Alsace, but could never
recover Schwaben. His first Wife was Elizabeth, Daughter of the Emperor
Rupert, by whom he had only a Daughter, of its Mother's Name, which died in its
Infancy. But on his second Duchess, which was Anne, Daughter of Frederick Duke
of Brunswick, he begat a Son, named Sigismund, a great Lover of Letters, thence
styled The Me^oenas of learned Men: Twice married, yet deceased without Issue.
4. Ernestus Ferreus (or Ironside) the only Propagater of the Austrian Race,
married first to Margaret, Daughter of Boleslaus Duke of Pomerania; and then to
Cimburg Daughter to the Duke of Mosovie; which last bore him nine Children,
whereof four at least lived to be of Age; namely, margaret, married to
Frederick the Second Elector of Saxony: Catharine, to Charles Marquess of
Baden. Frederick the Fourth: And Albert the Sixth, surnamed The Prodigal,
excommunicated and proscribed, as Author of several Tumults and Seditions. He
died 1463.


. VI. Frederick the Fourth (but third Emperor of that Name) was elected
Emperor in 1440. Crowned at Aix la Chapelle, in 1442. and ten Years after at
Rome, by Pope Nicholas the Fitch. He had Vienna taken from him by Matthias King
of Hungary. In his Reign PRINTING was first found out; the League of Schwaben
confirmed; and Constantinople taken by the Turks. His Empress was Eleanor,
Daughter to Edward King of Portugal, who bore him five Children, whereof
Christopher, John, and Helena died in their Infancy: The two that survived,
were Cunigunda, given in Marriage to Albert the Fourth Duke of Bavaria; and

Maximilian the First, in whom the House of Austria was preserved, was born at
Naples, in the Year 1459. From his Infancy he pronounced his Words with so much
difficulty, that he was judged by most little better than dumb; which
Imperfection he so far mastered in the end, that he became famous for his
Eloquence. He was of a generous Disposition, and a great Lover of learned Men.
He was often under very dangerous Circumstances; but always surmounted 'em
happily in the end. In 1486. he was elected King of the Romans, his Father
Frederick being yet alive. He refused to be Crowned by the Pope; but pretended
to the Papal Dignity himself. In short, he magnified Justice, loved Humility,
exercised Clemency, and took much pains in searching out the Original of his
Family. In his Reign the Reformation was set on foot by Luther; the Imperial
Chamber instituted; the Empire divided into Circles; Vienna restored to the
House of Austria; and Burgundy, and the Provinces of the Low Countries, annexed
to the same Family. The Consorts of his Bed and Fortunes were, Mary, Daughter
and sole Heiress of Charles Duke of Burgundy; and after her, Blanch Mary,
Daughter of Galeazzo Duke of Milan. By the first he had Issue, Margaret; who
after many turns of Fortune, was in the end made Governess of the Netherlands;
and died 1530. And Philip, a Prince worthy the noblest Character, of whom more
immediately in the next Section. As for Maximilian, being full of Days and
Content, he piously and peaceably departed this Life, on the Twelfth of Jan.
1519.

. VII. Philip the First, styled The Delight of Mankind, first saw the Light, in
1478. At three Years old he was installed Knight of the Golden Fleece: At
seventeen, his Father gave him the Government of the Low Countries and
Burgundy. In 1496. he married the Princess Johanna, eldest Daughter and Heiress
of his Catholic Majesty Ferdinand King of Spain; in whose Right he became
immediately possessed of the Kingdoms of Arragon and Castile: But he was not
long to preside over so many and so great Provinces, being taken off by an
untimely death, in the Year 1506. and the 28th. of his Age; nevertheless,
having first seen himself Father of a fair Issue, by his most beloved Consort
Queen Joan. The Daughters were, 1. Eleanor, married first to Emanuel King of
Portugal, and after his decease, to Francis the First, King of France. 2.
Isabella, married to Christianus the Second, King of Denmark, which proved a
very unhappy Match. She died in the Low Countries, An. 1525. 3. Margaret,
married to Lewis the Infant, King of Hungary; and after his unhappy death, made
Governess of the Netherlands. 4. Catharine, born after her Father's decease;
betrothed to John Frederick Elector of Saxony; but afterward married to John
the Third, King of Portugal.


His Sons were, Charles the Fifth, and Ferdinand the First, betwixt which two
Princes, there was a Division of the Provinces; whence the House of Austria
became likewise divided into the Spanish and German Lines. And first for the
Spanish.

Of the Spanish Line,
. VIII. THe Author whereof was Charles the Fifth, born at Gaunt in Flanders, in
1500. At fourteen Years old he had the Government of the Netherlands given him;
at sixteen he was Crowned King of Spain; at nineteen, elected Emperor, and
Crowned the Year following at Aix la Chapelle. In 1521. he held his first Diet
at Worms. He had very great Wars with Francis the First, King of France, whom
he defeated and made Prisoner, in the Year 1525. He likewife seized Rome, and
besieged the Pope in his Castle there; and annexed the Duchy of Milan for ever
to his House. In 1532. at a Diet then held at Ratisbonne, the Protestaut
Confession of Faith was exhibited, and publicly read before him. Some Years
after, he had Wars with the Protestants, wherein he took John Frederick Elector
of Saxony Prisoner, in 1545. and thereupon transferred the Electoral Dignity
from him, to Maurice Duke of Saxony. He likewise caused Philip Landtgrave of
Hesse, to be put in custody; yet in the end concluded the Peace of Passaw with
those of that Religion, in 1552. Three Years after, he abdicated the
Government, leaving the Empire to his Brother Ferdinand; and the Kingdom of
Spain, with the Low Countries, and its other Dependencies, to his Son Philip.
After his Abdication, he retired to a Cloister in St. Justus's Monastery in
Spain; where, having spent about two or three Years, he piously and peaceably
ended his days, 1558. leaving Issue by Isabel, Daughter of Emanuel King of
Portugal, one Son and two Daughters; viz. Mary, married to the Emperor
Maximilian the Second; Joanna, to John Infant of Portugal; and Philip the
Second, of whom more in the next Section. Besides these, he had one natural
Daughter, named Margaret, begotten on Mademoiselle de Plumbes, and married to
Alexander de Medices, Duke of Urbin; and after his decease, to Octavio
Farnesse, Duke of Parma: As also a Son, by Madamoselle de Blomberg; namely, the
most Valiant and Renowned Hero, Don John of Austria.

. IX. But to return into our way: The only Heir of Charles the Fifth, was
Philip the Second, born 1527. made King of Sicily and Naples 1543. King of
England and Ireland in right of his Wife, 1554. Lord of the Low Countries and
Duke of Milan, 1555. and last of all King of Spain, 1556. He obtained the
famous Victory of St. Quintin over the French; but soon after, lost Calice to
them. He was Author of the Spanish Inquisition. Moreover, he lost seven of the
Low Country Provinces; as also the famour Armada sent against the English. In
1580. he overcame the Kingdom of Portugal, and by force of Arms caused himself
to be Crowned King thereof. His first Queen was Mary, Daughter to John the
Third, King of Portugal; his second, another Mary, Daughter to Henry the
Eighth, King of England, and then Queen of that Kingdom; his third, Isabella
(or Elizabeth) a Daughter of Henry the Second's, King of France; and his
fourth, Anne, Daughter of the Emperor Maximilian the Second. By the first he
had Prince Charles, born 1565. deceased in Prison, 1568. By the third, Isabella
Clara Eugenia, born 1566. married to Albert the Seventh of Austria; deceased
1633. and Catharine, born 1567. and married to Charles Emanuel, Duke of Savoy,
on the Eleventh of March, 1585. By the last, a Son of his own Name, viz.

Philip the Third, born 1578. in whose Issue the Spanish Line was continued: He
succeeded his Father in his Kingdoms, in 1598. And in 1610. expelled nine
hundred thousand Moors and Jews out of Spain. His death bears date 1621. His
Queen was Margaret, Daughter to Charles Archduke of Austria, who bore him eight
Children, whereof three died in their Infancy. The rest were, 1. Anna Maria
Mauritia, married to Lewis the Thirteenth, King of France, 1615. deceased July
3. 1640. 2. Mary Anne, married to the Emperor Ferdinand the Third, 1631.
deceased May 13. 1646. 3. Charles, a Prince of the Noblest Virtues; but taken
off by a too untimely Fate. 4. Ferdinand, Cardinal and Governor of the
Netherlands; deceased 1641. And, 5. Philip the Fourth, surnamed Dominicus
Victor, succeeded his Father in 1621. and took on him the Government at the Age
of sixteen. He lost the American Plate-Fleet: He entered into a perpetual
Alliance with the States of Holland: He concluded the Pyrenaean Peace with the
French: And, in short, was an unfortunate Prince, during the whole course of
his Reign. He had two Wives; Elizabeth, Daughter to Henry the Fourth, King of
France, who bore him seven Children; but all of 'em either died young, or in
their Infancy, except Maria Theresia, married to Lewis the Fourteenth, the
present French King, in 1660. since deceased, July 30. 1683. His second Match
was with Mary Anne, Daughter to the Emperor Ferdinand the Third; by whom he
had Issue, 1. Margaret Theresia, married to Leopold the present Emperor, in
1666. deceased March 20. 1673. And, 2. Charles the Second, the present King of
Spain, born Nov. 6. 1661. who succeeded in that Kingdom, at the death of his
Father Philip, in the Year 1665. In 1679. he took to Wife Mary Louise, Daughter
of Philip Duke of Orleans; who dying without Issue in 1689. he, the same Year,
married Mariae Anna, Daughter of Philip William Elector Palatine, the present
Queen. All which being thus fully explained, we now come to the German Line.



Of the German Line.
. X. PRoceed we therefore to speak of the other Son, of Philip the First, as
Authose of the German Line. His Name was Ferdinand, born in Spain 1503. Crowned
King of Hungary and Bohemia in right of his Wife, 1527. Elected King of the
Romans 1531. and Emperor in 1556. He had great Wars with the Turks, as also
with the Protestants. He permitted the Bohemians to Communicate under both
kinds. His Empress was Anne, Daughter to Uladislaus King of Hungary, Sister to
Lewis the Infant. The day of his death happened in the Year 1653. and sixtieth
of his Age, after he had had this following Issue: 1. Elizabeth, born 1526.
married to Sigismund King of Poland, 1545. 2. maximilian, born Aug. 1. 1527. 3.
Anne, born 1528. married to Albert the Fifth, Duke of Bavaria; deceased October.

Joanna, born 1547. married to Francis Duke of Florence, 1565. deceased 1578.


As for the three Sons, Maximilian, Ferdinand, and Charles, they had their
Father's Territories divided amongst 'em; by which division, Maximilian
obtained Hungary, Bohemia, and Austria; Ferdinand had Tyrol and Alsace; and
Charles Stiria and Carinthia. Of these we shall speak apart, in their proper
places.

. XI. Maximilian II. was crowned King of Bohemia Sept. 20. 1562. and of Hungary
on Sept. 8. in the following Year. He was likewise elected King of the Romans
in the aforesaid Year 1562. and Emperor in 64. He was a pious, just, peaceable
Prince, and no great Enemy to the Protestants. He had Wars with Solomon
Emperor of the Turks; brought Gunbrachius and his Accomplices to condign
punishment; and did by no means approve of the Massacre at Paris. He departed
this Life at Ratisbonne, having had fifteen Children by his Empress Mary,
Daughter to Charles V. whereof six died young. The rest were, 1. Anne, born
1549. married to Philip II. King of Spain, 1570. deceased 1580. 2. Rudolph II.
born June 18. 1552. who succeeded his Father in the Empire, October. 12 1576. and
carried on the War with the Port. In 1595. he lost Raab; but it was recovered
three Years after, by Rudolph Count Swartzburg. In 1569. he lost Erla also
Kanisa in 1600. and Gran in 1605. He died a Batchellor at Prague, Jan. 10. 1612
and left a vast Treasure behind him. 3. Ernestus II. born June 15. 1553. And

he married Anne, Daughter to his Uncle Ferdinand Archduke of Austria;
nevertheless, died without Issue 1619. 6. Maximilian III, born October. 12. 1558.
In 1587. he was Crowned King of Poland; but being afterward defeated and
imprisoned by the contrary Faction, was forced to quit his Pretensions to that
Crown, to obtain his Liberty. In 1596. he fought a Battle with the Turks not
far from Erla, where he was routed with his whole Army. He was also Grand
Master of the Teutonick Order; and died in 1620. 7. Albert VII. born Nov. 13.
1559. and created Cardinal of the Holy Cross; but quitting his Orders, was

1578. 9. Margaret, a professed Nun; deceased 1633. aged sixty six.


. XII. The second Son of Ferdinand I. Emperor, was Ferdinand II. as was
already observed; a Prince eminent for his Courage; who notwithstanding he had
many advantageous Matches offered him, refused 'em all, and married the Lady
Philippina Welseriana, Daughter of Free Baron of Xinnenberg; by whom he had
Issue, 1. Andrew, Bishop of Brescia, and Cardinal; deceased Nov. 11. 1600. 2.
Charles, Marquess of Burgovia, deceased without Issue 1618. notwithstanding he

Catharine, a Nun. He had three Children more, but they died in their Infancy.


. XIII. Matters thus cleared, we now proceed to speak of Charles, third Son of
the Emperor Ferdinand I. in whose Issue the Austrian Family in Germany was
preserved. In the division of the Hereditary Provinces aforesaid, he had
Stiria, Carinthia, and Carniola, for his Patrimony; and took to Wife Mary
Daughter of Albert V. Duke of Bavaria, who bore him fifteen Children, whose
Names were as follows: 1. Ferdinand, born and dead the same Year, viz. 1572.
2. Anne, born 1573. married to Sigismund King of Poland 1592. deceased 1598. 3.

rather of a Martial than Ecclesiastical Temper, quitted his Orders, by a
Dispensation' from the Pope 1626. took to Wife Claudia, Daughter of Ferdinand
I. Grand Duke of Tuscany, Frederick Ubald Duke of Urbin's Widow: and died 1632.
leaving Issue, 1. Isabella Clara, born 1629. married to Charles III. the
present Duke of Mantua. 1640. deceased 1685. 2. Ferdinand Charles, born 1628.
In 1646. he married Anne, Daughter to Cosmus II. Duke of Florence; and died

Francis, born 1630. elected Bishop of Anopburg, 1640. promoted to a Red Hat,

Year 1590. Elected Bishop of Breslaw in 1608. of Brescia in 1614. and a little
after, Grand Master of the Teutonick Order. He died 1625.


. XIV. We now return to Ferdinand III. according to our Promise in the last
Section; Crowned King of Bohemia, June 21. 1617. of Hungary 1618. and the Year
following Elected and Crowned Emperor ( Aug. 30.) at Francfort, being the
second Emperor of this Name. In 1620. he suppressed the Tumults then raging in
Bohemia, by force of Arms: He also had Wars with the Protestants. The Year
following he proscribed Frederick V. Elector Palatine, and beat him out of his
Territories, transferring at the same time the Electoral Dignity from him to
Maximilian Duke of Bavaria. He was twice married; first in 1600. to Mary Anne,
Daughter of William V. Duke of Bavaria; and twenty two Years after, to Eleanor
of Mantua, Duke Vincent's Daughter. By the first he had two Daughters that
lived to be of Age; viz.

1. Mary Anne, married to Maximilian Elector of Bavaria; deceased September. 8.
1665. And, 2. Caecilia Renata, to Casimire King of Poland: She died March 13.
1644.
As also two Sons; viz.

Elected Bishop of Strasburg and Passaw. In 1643. he was defeated by Torstenson

. XV. Ferdinand IV. who succeeded in the Government of the Empire upon his
Father's decease, was Crowned King of Hungary in 1025. of Bohemia in 1627. of
the Romans 1636. and last of all Emperor in 1637. by the Name of Ferdinand
III. He carried on the War with the Swede. In 1639. he lost Brisac: In 1648. he
restored Peace to the Empire, by the Instrument of the Peace of Osnaburg. He
also made a Twenty Years Truce with the Turk; but assisted the Pole against the
Swede. His first Wife was Mary Anne, Daughter of Philip III. King of Spain,
deceased May 13. 1646. His second, maria Leopoldina, Daughter to the Archduke
Leopold V. And his third, Eleanora Gonzaga, Daughter of Charles Duke of Mantua,

1657. having had Issue, by the Princesses aforesaid, as follows: 1. Ferdinand
V. born Sept. 8. 1633. Crowned King of Bohemia 1646. of Hungary 1647. of the
Romans 1653. being the Fourth King of this Name; but died the next Year, which
was the Twenty first of his Age, to the great Grief of his Father and all good
Men. 2. Mary Anne, born October. 12. 1634. married to Philip. IV. King of Spain,

April 7. 1689. And, 11. Ferdinand Aloisius, born 1657. deceased the Year
following.


. XVI. Leopold VI. (but first Emperor of the Name) the most Invincible, most
Powerful, and, in one word, the most happy Emperor of the Romans, was
inaugurated King of Hungary at Presburg, June 27. 1655. Old Style; of Bohemia,
at Prague, Aug. 2. 1656. and Emperor, at Francfort, July 22. 1658. having been
elected on the 11th. He had War with the Turks from the Year 1661. to 64. at
which time a Truce was made with 'em for Twenty Years; which not being well
observed by the Turks, the War broke out afresh, which by the Divine
Assistance, has proved (in a manner) fatal to the Ottoman Empire. He has also
formerly had War with the French, before the breaking out of the present. In
1666. he married Margaret Teresa, Daughter of Philip IV. King of Spain, who
died March 20. 1673. Whereupon he took to Wife Claudia Felicitas, Daughter to
the Arckduke Ferdinand, October. 15. in the same Year: But she likewise died,
April 8. 1676. he proceeded to a third Choice; which was, Eleanora Magdalen

By the second he had only two Daughters, both short lived, viz.

1. Anne Mary, born and dead the same Year, 1674. And, 2. Maria Josepha, born
1675. deceased the Year following.
But by the present Empress, 1. Joseph James Ignatius John Antony Eustachius;
the Joy and Hope of his Parents, born July 16. (O.S.) 1678. Crowned King of
Hungary 1688. 2. Mary Elizabeth Licia Teresa Josepha, born December. 13. 1680. 3.

4. 1684. 4. Mary Anne Josepha Antonia Regina, born September. 7. 1683. 5. Mary

Antonia, born March 6. 1687. (O. S.) And, 8. Anne Josepha Antonia Magdalen
Gabriele, March. 26. 1689. (O. S.)


Of the Augmentation of this Family.
. XVII. It Is to be observed of the Earls of Habsburg, That they were not simply
such, but Sovereign Princes also; an Argument whereof is, their having Noble
men for their Tasters and Cup-bearers. Moreover, about the time of Rudolph,
they were possessed of no less than eight several Counties, viz. Habsburg,
Kyburg, Baden, Lentsburg, Thun, Reinsfelden, Ruppetswiel, and Niddow; besides
the Landtgraveships (or Landtgraviates) of Alsace, Torgaw, and the Lesser
Burgundy. See Spener's Oper. Herald. lib. 1. c. 9. Sect. 62. and Sigismund van
Berken, etc. lib. 1. c. 5. page 37. Afterward Rudolph, when he came to be
Emperor in 1273. held a Diet at Ausburg in 1282, where by the unanimous
Consent of the Princes of the Empire, he had Austria, Stiria, Vinidorum
Marchia, and Carniola, settled on his eldest Son Albert, as also Schwaben on
Rudolph, as a Fee Farm of the Empire then void. In 1324. Albert II. had the
County of Pfirte in Dowry with his Wife. In 1330. Lewis of Bavaria, the
Emperor, mortgaged Brisac, Schaffhuse, and Newenburg in Switzerland, to the
House of Austria, for Forty Thousand Crowns; and three Years after, gave it the
Duchy of Carinthia, then without a Prince, to be held in Fee of the Empire. In
1363. this Family became possessed of the County of Tyrol, by the Donation of
Margaret Maultaschen: And in 1366. it bought Freiburg in Brifgow for twelve
thousand Crowns. In 1373. Leopold II. purchased the Earldom of Feldkirchen in
Nebelgovia, for six and thirty thousand Florens; as also Pludentz, Sargan, and
Heiligenberg; and had the Government of Schwaben mortgaged to him by the
Emperor Wenceslaus. In 1456 the last Count of Cillei being slain, that County
was claimed by the House of Austria, as part of Stiria. In 1476 (or 7.)
Maximilian I. by a Marriage with the Princess Mary, Daughter and sole Heiress
of Charles the Hardy, last Duke of Burgundy, became in her right possessed of
the Earldom of Burgundy, (or Franche Comte) and the Seventeen Provinces of the
Netherlands, together with a Right to the Duchy of Burgundy. Three Years
before this, Frederick his Father, the Emperor, had the County of Goritia, or
Gortz, in Friuli, fell to him, together with the Cities of Grado, Ticect, and
Zeng, on the Adriatic Sea, upon the death of the last Count thereof, and by
right of Agreement to a mutual Succession 'twixt him and that Prince. In 1496.
Philip I. married Johanna, sole Daughter and Heiress of Ferdinand King of
Spain; and by that Match, annexed all Spain, the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily,
the Islands of Sardinia, Majorca, Minorca, and Malta, to the House of Austria.
In 1527. Ferdinand I. in right of his Wife, added the Kingdoms of Hungary and
Bobemia, with all their Dependencies, to the same Family. In Charles V.'s
Reign, there was an Accession of the Duchy of Milan, as a Fief of the Empire
then void. In 1580. Philip II. partly in pretended right of his Wife, and
partly by right of Inheritance from his Mother Isabella but chiefty by force of
Arms, possessed himself of Portugal; as also whatever else the Portuguese then
held, either in the East Indies, or Atlantic Sea. Ferdinand the Second
Emperor of the Name, wholly reduced the Kingdom of Bohemia, together with
Moravia, Silesia, and Lusatia. Joseph I. was made King of Hungary, by right of
Inheritance on the Ninth of December, 1687. whereas 'till then that Kingdom had
been Elective. But more than this, the House of Austria has, for many Ages now
past, enjoyed the Imperial Dignity; which (indeed) can be transferred from it
to no other, without apparent danger to the whole Empire. It is also in some
expectance of the Duchy of Wirtenburg's falling to it. See Layritz Palmwald,
page 477.

Of its Losses, or Decrease.
. XVIII. OF the Cities and Provinces abovementioned, many have again been lost
by this Family, through the injury of Time. And indeed the first Loss suffered
by it, was in the Fourteenth Century; at which time, the Counties of Habsburg,
Baden, and Kiburg, were taken from it, by the prosperous Success of the Arms of
the Swiss. In 1415. by reason of the proscription of Frederick III. (mentioned
by us Sect. V. Numb. 3.) it lost the whole Duchy of Schwaben, except some few
places; namely, the Marquisate of Burgow, the Counties of Hellenburg,
Hochbergen, Chingen, Schelcflingen, and the Provincial Government of Schwaben;
which Countries it stands still possessed of in that Duchy. In 1472. the
Duchy of Crossen in Silesia was mortgaged to the Family of Brandenburg; and
not being redeemed in due time, Joachim I. became fully possessed of it, by an
indisputable Title, in the Year 1538. In 1501. Schaffbuse was given up to the
Swiss. In 1529. (or 92 rather) and the Years following, the Turks took many
Places in Hungary; but most of 'em re-taken some time after. In 1572. and in
the Years following, seven Provinces of the Netherlands withdrew their
Allegiance from the Crown of Spain; and since that, down to the present times,
the French have made themselves Masters of great part of the rest. In 1640.
Portugal revolted, and set up a King of its own: Whereupon Goa likewise, and
the other Provinces in the East Indies, rejected the Spanish Yoke. In 1648. all
Alsace was set over to the French: See the Instrument of the Treaty of Peace at
Osenburg, concluded 'twixt the Emperor and French King. Sect. Drittens Thun,
etc. In the same Year Brisac and Suntgaw were put into the hands of the French.
In 1659. the French obtained great part of the Spanish Netherlands by the
Pyrenaean Peace: See the 35th. and following Articles. By the Treaty of
Nimeguen, 1678. Friburgh was given up to the French; as also the County of
Burgundy (or Franche Comte) together with whatever else as yet remained in
Artois. In 1684 the French, by force of Arms, made themselves Masters of the
Duchy of Luxenburg: as well as of the City of the same Name. In 1686. the
Principality of Swibuse, together with the City of that Name, was, by an
amicable Accommodation, delivered up to the Elector of Brandenburg. Last of
all, the French King breaking the Truce, took Philipsburg on the Rhine from
this Family, Nov. 1. 1688. O. S.

Of its Pretensions.
. XIX. THe Pretensions of the House of Austria, are, (1.) To the Duchy of
Burgundy, which appertained of right to Maximilian I. as having married Mary,
Daughter and sole Heiress of Burgundy; but the then King of France refused to
invest him, on pretense of the Salique Law. (2.) To Transylvania, Moldavia,
Walachia, and Bulgaria, as Dependencies of the Kingdom of Hungary. (3.) To the
Counties of Habsburg, Baden, and Kiburg. (4.) To the City of Schaffbuse. (5.)
To the Kingdom of Portugal, as having actually revolted from that of Spain.
(6.) To the Duchy of Luxenburg. And lastly, To the City and Castle of
Philipsburg.

CHAP. II. Of the House of France.
. I. TO find out the Rise of the present House of France, we are to look back
as far as Hugh the Great, Duke of France, Burgundy, and Aquitain, Marquess of
Orleans, and Earl of Paris; deceased 956. His eldest Son was Hugh Capet, Duke
of France, Marquess of Orleans, and Count of Paris, who, upon the death of
Lewis the Slothful, last King of France, of the Race of Charlemaigne, was, by
the unanimous Consent of the Peers of France, inaugurated King of that Kingdom,
An. 987. And his Son Robert being in the same Year declared his Successor,
united the aforesaid Provinces to the Crown. His Queen was Aloisia, Daughter of
William Duke of Aquitain, by whom he had Issue Robert aforesaid; from his great
Piety surnamed The Saint, who succeeded in the Throne of France, upon the death
of his Father, in the Year 998. He was also Heir to the Duchy of Burgundy,
upon his Uncle Henry's decease; and departed this Life himself in 1031. having
had two Queens, viz. Bertha, Daughter of Conrade King of Burgundy; and
Constance, Daughter of William Count of Arles and Provence: And by then two
Sons; namely, 1. Henry, of whom more in the next Section. And, 2. Robert,
Propagator of the Line of Burgundy, the which became extinct in Philip Duke of
Burgundy, An. 1361. And whereas it had spread it self into two lesser Branches,
viz. that of Montaigue, and that of Vienne, or Dauphine; yet the first failed
in Claudius de Montaigue, An. 1468. the other in Humbert II. 1358. who seeing
himself destitute of Issue, made over Dauphine to Philip of Valois, King of
France, for 40000 Florins; and on condition, That for the future, the eldest
Son of France should be styled, The Dauphin.


. II. Return we now to Henry I. Crowned King of France 1031. The beginning of
whose Reign was made uneasy by his Mother; for she being desirous to advance
his Brother Robert to the Throne, stirred up many of the Nobility against him:
But the Business being decided by a Battle, the Victory fell to the juster
side. His Death bears date 1060. And his Issue by Agnes, Daughter of Basilius
King of Russia, were, 1. Philip I. And, 2. Hugh, Count de Vermandois, de
Valois, de Chaumont, and d'Amiens; whose Posterity failed in Rudolph II. Count
de Vermandois, etc. An. 1158.


Philip succeeded his Father at the age of nine Years, and was Crowned King of
France An. 1060. His first Queen was Bertha, Daughter of Florence I. Earl of
Holland, whom he divorced in 1093. and married Bertrada, Daughter to Simon Earl
of Montfort. By the first be had, 1. Lewis VI. (but first of this Line)
surnamed The Gross; born 1081. 2. Henry, deceased an Infant. 3. Constance,
married to Hugh Earl of Champaigne; and after his decease, to Boemund Prince of
Antioch.


By the second, 1. Philip, Count de Man's, who married Elizabeth, Daughter of
Guy the second Baron of Mont le Herry; but died without Issue. 2. Florus,
Father of Elizabeth of Nantes. 3. Caecilia, married first to Tancred Prince of
Antioch; and after his decease, to Pontius of Toulouse, Count of Tripoli in
Syria. And, 4. Eustachia, espoused to John, Count d'Estampes.


Of these, Lewis succeeded his Father at his decease; and was Crowned King of
France in the Year 1108. His Queen's Name was Adelain, Daughter of Humbert II.
Duke of Savoy, who bore him this following Issue: 1. Philip, deceased sixteen
Years old. 2. Lewis VII. born 1119. of whom in the next Section. 3. Henry,
Archbishop of Reims. 4. Robert III. Count de Dreux, whose Posterity became
extinct in John, An. 1590. 5 Philip, Archdeacon of Paris; deceased 1164. 6
Peter, Baron (or Lord) of Courtnay, whose Posterity failed in Stephen de
Raviers, An. 1383. 7. Hugh, deceased in his Infancy. And, 8. Constance, married
to Raymund Earl of Toulouse.


. III. Lewis VII. surnamed The Younger, was born in 1119. and Crowned King of
France 1131. His first Queen was Eleanor, Daughter and Heiress of William Duke
of Aquitain, whom he divorced in 1152. After which, she was married to Henry
Duke of Normandy; who coming afterward to be King of England, did grievously
annoy the French King. His second was Constance, Daughter to Alphonso VIII.
King of Castile, who died in 1159. And his third Alice, Daughter of Theobald
Earl of Chambagne, whom he married in 1161. She died 1205. By the first he had
Issue, 1. Mary, married to Henry Count de Champagne: She died 1179. And, 2.
Alice, married to Theobald Earl of Chartres and Blois.


By the second only a Daughter, named

Margaret, married to Henry, eldest Son of Henry II. King of England, and after
his decease, to Bela III. King of Hungary, whom she likewise outlived, and
went in Pilgrimage to the Holy Land, in the City of Acres, An. 1198.

By by the third, 1. Philip II. surnamed Augustus, born Aug. 22. 1166. 2.
Alice, married to William Count de Ponthieu. And, 3. Agnes, given in marriage
to Comenius Alexius, Emperor of Constantinople, 1180. and after his death, to
Theodore Branas, Lord of Adrianople.


Philip II.'s Inauguration to the Crown of France, was Nov. 1. 1179. This
Prince very much enlarged both the Power and Patrimony of the Crown of France;
for having overcome John sans Terre (or Lack-land) King of England, he brought
Normandy, Bretagne, Anjon, Touraine, Poictiers, Clermont, and part of Aquitain,
under his Jurisdiction. His first Queen was Isabella, Daughter of Baldwin IV.
Earl of Haynault; after whose decease, he married Ingeburg, Daughter of
Waldemar King of Denmark; but being afterward divorced from her, proceeded to
a third Choice, which was the Lady Agnes, Daughter of Berthold Duke of -- By
the first he had Issue only

Lewis VIII. born 1187. of whom in the next Section.

But by the third, 1. Philip, Earl of Bologne, Clermont, etc. who by Maud,
Daughter of Reginald Earl of Dammarlin, had Issue a Daughter named Joan: and
married to Scaevola de Chatillon. 2. Mary, after the decease of her first
Husband Philip of Haynault, Earl of Namur, re-married to Henry IV. Duke of
Brabant: She died 1238.


. IV. Lewis VIII. was Crowned King of France in 1224. having before this been
elected, and had Fealty solemnly sworn him, as King of England, by the Nobility
of that Kingdom, at London, An. 1216. But the English, upon the death of King
John, changed their Minds, and returned to their Allegiance to the young King
Henry III. Whereupon despising the Natural INCONSTANCY of that Nation, he
returned for France. Nor was he long to govern that Realm, being taken off by
an untimely death, in the Year 1226. His Queen's Name was Blanch, Daughter of
Alphonso IX. King of Castile; by whom he had nine Children, whereof five died
young. The four that outlived him were, 1. Lewis IX. surnamed The Saint; born
April. 25. 1215. 2. Robert Earl of Artois; which Branch of the Family, withered
in Charles d'Artois, Count d'Eu, in the Year 1472. 3. Charles, Earl of Anjou
and Main, born 1220 Crowned King of both the Sicily's in 1266. or 63. and
Titular King of Jerusalem ten Years after. His Posterity reigned in the Kingdom
of Naples, 'till 1435. in Hungary 'till 1325. and in Poland 'till 1400. 4.
Alphonso, married indeed, yet deceased without Issue. As for Queen Isabella
their Mother, she ended her Life in a Cloister, where she retired after the
King her Husband's death.


Lewis IX. was Crowned King of France in the Year 1226. and very much improved
the Demesnes of the Crown. He took upon him the Croisade, and made an
Expedition to the Holy Land; in which War, he was taken Prisoner by the
Sarazens, after the City of Damieta had surrendered to him: But being ransomed
by his Subjects, returned home. After this, he ventured on a second Expedition,
but died of the Plague at the Siege of Tunis, An. 1270. His Queen was margaret,
Daughter of Reimund Berengarius Earl of Provence, who departed this life 1285.
having born him this following Issue: 1. Isabella, born 1241. married to
Theobald II. King of Navarr, deceased 1275. 2. Lewis, who took to Wife
Berengaria, Daughter of Alphonso X. King of Castile; yet died without Issue
1275. 3. Philip III. surnamed the Bold, born 1245. of whom in the next Section.
4. John, Earl of Nevers and Valois; deceased without Issue 1270. 5. Blanch,
married to Ferdinand Prince of Castile; deceased 1320. 6. Peter, Count
d'Alencon and Chartres; deceased Issueless 1283. 7. Robert V. Count de
Clermont, and Lord of Bourbon, of whom more beneath in the Line of Bourbon,
Sect. XII. as Ancestor in a direct Line of the present French King.


. V. Philip III. surnamed the Bold, was Crowned King of France in 1271. A
Prince very deficient in most of chose Virtues that should adorn a King; given
to drink, and easily led by those that were about him. Surnamed The Bold, not
from any true Courage that was eminent in him; but because in that fostness of
Mind, he would yet brutishly expose himself to the greatest Dangers in time of
Action. His first Queen was Isabella, Daughter of James I. King of Arragon, who
died in 1271. after which, he married Mary, Daughter to Henry III. Duke of
Brabant; and departed this Life 1285. The Issue that survived were, 1. Philip
IV. surnamed The Fair; born 1268. 2. Charles, Earl of Valois, Anjou, etc. of
whom in the next Section, as Author and Propagator of the Line of Valois. 3.
Lewis, Count d'Eureux, whose Posterity became extinct in Charles III. King of
Navarr, An. 1416. 4. Margaret, married to Edward I. King of England, in 1300.
or 1. And, 5. Blanch, to Rudolph of Austria in the same Year. She died 1305.


Of these, Philip the Fair succeeded his Father, and was Crowned King of France
in the Year 1286. He joined the Kingdom of Navarr to that of France; which
Kingdom was brought him in Marriage by his Wife Joan, together with the County
of Aquitain, and Territory of Brigen. He had a sharp War with the Flemings, by
whom his Forces were utterly defeated, at the famous Battle of Courtray. He had
also several Contests with the Pope, to whom he returned the famous Answer of,
Sciat tua Magna Fatuitas, Nos in Temporalibus nemini subesse, upon his
Holiness's pretending to command and direct him in some secular Affairs.
Moreover, the Order of Knights Templars was first abolished, by his Example and
Interest, throughout Christendom, in the Year 1311. or 7. His Issue, necessary
to be here mentioned, were, 1. Lewis X. surnamed Hutin, King of France and
Navarr; born 1280. Crowned 1315, or 14. deceased (and that without Issue Male)
1316. 2. Philip V. surnamed The Long, King of France and Navarr; born 1292.
Crowned 1317. or 6. deceased likewise without Issue Male, 1321. or 2. 3.
Charles IV. surnamed The Fair, King of France and Navarr, who had the same fate
with his Brethren; for he died in 1327/8. leaving his Wife with Child, which
likewise proved a Daughter. 4. Isabella, married at twelve Years old, to Edward
II. King of England, Jan. 28. 1307. O. S. deceased 1375.


Of the Line of Valois.
. VI. WE now return to Charles Count de Valois, d'Anjou, du Main, d'Alencon,
and du Perch, second Son to Philip the Bold. He was thrice married, his first
Wife being Margaret, Daughter of Charles II. King of Sicily: His second,
Catharine de Courtney, Daughter of the Emperor of Constantinople: And his
third, Maud, Daughter of Guy de Chatillon, Count de St. Paul, who died 1358. By
these he had Issue, as follows: 1. Isabella, married to John III. Duke of
Bretagne; deceased 1309. 2. Joan, the Wife of William the Good, Earl of
Haynault, Holland, and Zealand: She died in the Year 1400. 3. Philip VI. of
whom in the next Section. 4. Charles Count d'Alencon and de Chartres whose
Posterity became extinct in Charles Duke d'Alencon, in the Year 1512. 5.
Margarct, married to Guy de Chatillon, Earl of Blois. 6. Catharine, to Charles
of Sicily, Earl of Tarento. 7. Joan, to Robert of Artois, Earl of Beaumont: She
died 1363. 8. Lewis, Earl of Chartres; deceased without Issue, An. 1328. 9.
Isabella, Lady Abbess of Fonteverard. 10. Mary, married to Charles of Sicily,
Duke of Calabria. 11. Another Isabel, married to Peter I. Duke of Bourbon. And,
12. Blanch, to the Emperor Charles IV. She died 1345.


. VII. Wherefore after the decease of the three Brethren, Lewis Hutin, Philip
the Long, and Charles the Fair, without Issue Male, the Government was settled
on Philip de Valois, their Cousin-Germain, notwithstanding the Claim of Edward
III. King of England, Son to Isabel, eldest Sister of the three last Kings,
whose Pretensions (as the French said) were cut off by the Salique Law.
Nevertheless, it was soon after the occasion of a bloody War 'twixt him and
King Philip: Whose two Wives, were Joan Daughter of Robert II. Duke of
Burgundy; deceased 1348. and Blanch, Daughter of Philip King of Navarr, who
died 1398. By the^^ he had Issue, 1. John I. surnamed The Good. 2. Philip, Duke
of Orleans, deceased without Issue. 3. Mary, married to John of Brabant, Duke
of Limburg: She died 1333. 4. Joan, a posthumous Daughter, betrothed to John of
Arragon, Duke of Gironda (or Girona) but died before the Marriage could be
consummated, An. 1371.


Of these, John succeeded to the Throne, and was Crowned in 1350. This Prince
continued the War with the English; but with no better success than his Father
had done; for he was defeated, and taken Prisoner by them at the Battle of
Poictiers, Sept. 19. 1356. O.S. Being again set at liberty, he departed this
Life in 1361/4. aged fifty six. His two Queens were Bona, Daughter of the King
of Bohemia: And Joan, of William Earl of Clermont. By the first Venture, this
following Issue lived to be Men and Women: 1. Charles V. surnamed The Wise;
born Jan. 21. 1337. of whom in the next Section. 2. Lewis, Duke of Anjou and
Touraine; Crowned King of Sicily on this side the Pharus (or Watchtower) in
1382. whose Posterity failed in Nicholas Duke of Calabria, An. 1473. 3. Philip,
Duke of Burgundy, born 1341. whose Posterity ended in Mary, last Heiress of
that Duchy, An. 1483. 4. Joan, married to Charles III. King of Navarre;
deceased 1373. 5. Isabella, to John Galeazzo Duke of Milan, in 1360. And, 6.
John, Duke of Berry; he deceased without Issue 1416. 7. Margaret, professed a
Nun.


. VIII. Charles V. surnamed The Wise, was Crowned King of France, May 19. 1364.
He was the first who in his Father's Life time was styled, The Dauphin. He
restored the Commonwealth of France, and repressed the Violence of its Enemies;
which he brought to pass more by Counsel and Delays, than force of Arms. He
also put forth a Sanction, whereby the eldest Sons of France, were for the
future declared of Age at Fourteen Years old, and fit to be Crowned and Govern.
His Queen's Name was Joan, Daughter of Peter I. Duke of Bourbon; by whom he had
Issue that outlived him, 1. Charles VI. born 1368. his Successor. 2. Lewis,
Duke of Orleans, Count de Valois, d'Angouleme, etc. born 1371. of whom in Sect.
X. And, 3. Catharine, married to John de Berry, Count de Montpensier: She died
1387.


As to what relates to Charles VI. he was Crowned King of France, Nov. 4. 1380.
'Twas this Prince that reduced the Lilies in his Coat of Arms to Three, which
the Kings of France, his Ancestors, bore without any determinate number; and at
each side, added a Stag for Supporters. In his Reign the Affairs of France were
brought to the lowest ebb; especially after the Battle of Agin-Court in Picardy
with the English; in which, four Princes of the Blood, with all the Flower of
the French Nobility, were lost. This great Blow was given October. 24. 1415.
After which, he would have excluded the Dauphin, and transferred the Kingdom to
the English. This unfortunate Prince departed this Life 1422. having been long
distracted. His Children by Isabella, Daughter of Stephen Duke of Bavaria, were
in number twelve, whereof six died young. The rest were, 1. Isabella, married
about the age of seven or eight, October. 28. 1396. O. S. to Richard II. King of
England; and after his decease, to Charles Duke of Orleans, An. 1402. She died
1409. 2. Charles VII. born Jan. 21. 1402. his Father's Successor. 3. Mary, she
was professed a Nun, and died 1438. 4. Joan, married to John VI. Duke of
Bretagne; deceased 1432. 5. Michaele, born 1394. married to Philip the Good
Duke of Burgundy; deceased 1422. 6. Catharine, born October. 27. 1400. married to
Henry V. King of England, Feb. 24. 1420. And after his decease, to Owen ap
Meridith ap Tudor, a Welsh Gentleman (but descended of the ancient British
Kings) Grandfather of King Henry VII. She died Jan. 3. 1437.


. IX. Charles VII. surnamed The Victorious, from the Victory he obtained over
the English at the Battle of Orleans, under the Conduct of the famous Joan de
Arcquis, freed France from the many Miseries it had so long groaned under, and
reestablished the Polity of that Kingdom. He likewise put forth a Sanction
whereby he very much curbed the pretended Jurisdiction of the Popes of Rome.
Yet was this (otherwise happy) Prince so plagued by his own Son the Dauphin,
that by reason thereof, he pined himself away, and died of Grief, An. 1461. The
Sharer of his Bed and Fortunes, was Mary of Anjou, Daughter of Lewis II. King
of Sicily; by whom he had Issue as follows: 1. Lewis XI. of whom we shall
soon treat. 2. Charles, Duke of Berry; born 1446. deceased 1472. 3. Joland,
married to Amadeus the eighth Duke of Savoy; deceased 1478. 4. Radegunda, to
Sigismund Duke of Austria: She died 14 --. 5. Catharine, to Charles Duke of
Burgundy: She died 14 --. 6. Joan, to John II. Duke of Bourbon; deceased 1482.
And, 7. Magdalen, promised to Uladislaus King of Hungary; but married to Gaston
Fuxius, Prince of Vienna, deceased 1486.


We now return to Lewis XI. born 1423. and Crowned 1461. a Prince excellently
skilled in the Art of Government. 'Twas he that instituted the Order of the
Knights of St. Michael, in the Year 1469. His Motto was, Qui nescit simulare,
nescit imperare. He kept his Designs so very close, that the Grand Marshall of
Normandy told him one day in raillery, Il faut, que votre haquenee soit bien
fort, puisque ille peut bien vos porter, vous and tout votre Conseil: That his
Mule must needs be very strong, since it could so easily carry him and all his
Counsel. For the rest of his Character: He was an undutiful Son, a severe
Father, and a disloyal Husband: implacable in his Nature, insomuch as he was
never known to be reconciled to any he had once fallen out with. Nor had he any
other esteem for Religion, but as it served his Interest. He departed this Life
Aug. 30. 1483/4. having had two Wives, viz. Margaret, Daughter of James I. King
of Scotland; and Charlotte, Daughter of Lewis Duke of Savoy; and by them a Son
and two Daughters; viz.

1. Anne, married to Peter Duke of Bourbon, 1473. deceased 1522. 2. Joan,
Duchess of Berry; born 1464. and married to Lewis Duke of Orleans, afterward
King; by whom she was divorced, and died 1504. 3. Charles VIII. born 1470. and
Crowned 1484. A little Man, of no bad Disposition, yet slow of Parts, and
altogether ignorant of Arts and Letters: Contracted at scarce six Years old, to
Elizabeth, Daughter of Edward IV. King of England; which Contract being
afterward broke, he was betrothed to Margaret, Daughter to the Emperor
Maximilian, who was accordingly sent into France, to have her Education there,
that she might the better be accustomed to the Manners of that Nation.
Nevertheless, she was sent home again by her Spouse, when he came to be his own
Master; and he married, or rather ravished Anne, Daughter and sole: Heiress of
the Duke of Bretagne, already married by Proxy to his designed Father-in-Law,
Maximilian the Emperor; but had no Issue by her that survived him. He came to
his End in the Flower of his Age, by a very odd Accident, in the Year 1498. for
going out of a Door at Amboise, where he then was, to see 'em run at Tilts, he
struck his Forehead with that violence against the top of it, as he was
presently after seized by an Apoplexy, and fell down dead in the place.
. X. Wherefore we must look back to Lewis Duke of Orleans, mentioned already by
us, in Sect. VIII. Numb. 2. This Prince took to Wife Valentine, Daughter of
Galeazzo Duke of Milan, who bare him this following Issue: 1. Charles, Duke of
Orleans and Milan, born 1391. 2. Philip, deceased without Issue 1420. 3.
Margaret, born 1406. She married Richard of Bretagne, Count d'Estampes, and
died 1464. 4. John, Count d'Angouleme; born 1404. of whom more in the next
Section, as being him in whose Issue the Descent of this Line was continued.


Charles, the eldest of these three, was taken Prisoner at the Battle of Agin
Court, and detained so in England for the space of five and twenty Years; but
in the end ransomed and set at liberty, by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy.
His death (which happened in 1465.) was hastened by the Indignation he
conceived, at having his Counsels despised and laughed at by King Lewis XI. He
was thrice married, his first Wife being Isabel, Daughter of Charles VI. King
of France, the Relict of Richard II. King of England; his second, Bona,
Daughter of Bernhard Count d'Armanac; and his third, Mary, Daughter of Adolph
Duke of Cleves. By these he had four Children: 1. Joan, married to John Duke of
Alencon. 2. Lewis XII. King of France. 3. Mary, married to John de Foix,
Viscount Narbon; deceased 1493. 4. Anne, Lady Abbess of Tonteurault.


Lewis XII. was advanced to the Throne, on the death of Charles VIII. without
Issue, and Crowned 1498. A merciful and gracious Prince; sparing of the Money
and Blood of his Subjects, and therefore very dear to his People, and styled by
'em, The Father of his Country. Yet was he unfortunate through the whole course
of his Life; witness Thuanus's History, lib. 1. His first Wife was Joan,
Daughter of King Lewis XI. a crooked and deformed Person, forced on him,
notwithstanding his aversion to her, and all the Protestations imaginable
against the injury done him by the King her Father, in hopes of her proving
barren. Wherefore having obtained the Crown, he divorced her. See Im. Hoff.
Geneal. Gal. in Vita Ludov. XII. and substituted in her room Anne, the Relict
of his Predecessor Charles VIII. After whose decease, he married a third time,
viz. Mary, Daughter of Henry VII. King of England; nevertheless, all his Male
Issue died young; so that he had only two Daughters; namely, 1. Claudia, born
1499. married to Francis I. King of France. And, 2. Renata, born 1509. married
to Hercules Duke of Ferrara.


. XI. Wherefore John Count d'Angoulesme must again appear; brought already on
the Stage in the last Section, Numb. 4. He was left in England, by his Brother
Charles, with King Henry V. as a Pledge for an Hundred thousand Crowns, and not
dismissed 'till thirty Years after. During which stay in England, he wholly
applied himself to the study of Learning, and true Piety; in which he made so
good progress, as to be held worthy, by the Council of Constance, of the Papal
Chair; which Dignity he nevertheless refused, that he might not incense his
Prince, King Charles VII. who was a great Stickler for the deposed Pope,
Eugenius IV. He married Margaret, Daughter of Alan IX. Viscount Roban, who bore
him a Son, named

Charles, Count d'Angoulesme, who took to Wife Aloisia, Daughter of Philip
Count de Bresse, afterward Duke of Savoy; by whom he had a Son, called
Francis, born Sept. 12. 1494.

This Francis succeeded Lewis XII. upon his dying without Issue Male, and was
Crowned King of France 1515. He was very prone to Venery and Lewdness, which
brought him into many and great Inconveniences. He lost the Duchy of Milan.
In 1515. (the first Year he came to the Crown) he overthrew the Swiss, at the
Battle of Marignan. He had great Wars with the Emperor Charles V. by whom he
was beaten at the Battle of Pavie, in the Year 1525. and being taken Prisoner
therein, was sent to Madrid. Being again set at liberty, he began the War
afresh; but with no better success; for in this second War, he was wholly
beaten out of Italy. He had likewise War with Henry VIII. King of England,
which ended in the Year 1546. He was a great Lover of Learning and learned Men,
whom he advanced and had in great esteem. He was the first that brought the
Custom of selling Offices and Preferments into France. He finally abolished the
Pragmatick Sanction, and agreed to the Concordat. Moreover, he granted Annats
to the Pope of Rome. His Queens were Claudia, Daughter to his Predecessor Lewis
XII. and Eleanor, Daughter of Philip I. King of Spain; which last died in the
Year 1558. he himself in 1547. leaving Issue a Son and two Daughters. The Son
was

Henry II. of whom in the next Section. The Daughters, 1. Magdalen, married to
James V. King of Scotland. And, 2. Margaret, married to Charles Duke of
Alencon; and after his decease, to Henry II King of Navarre.


. XII. Henry II. succeeded his Father, and was Crowned King of France in
1547/8. He was of a generous Disposition; a courageous and warlike Prince. He
took Metz, Toul, and Verdun from the Germans, and overthrew the Emperor
Charles V. in a Field Battle: He likewise beat the English out of all their
footing in France, by taking Calice; yet was defeated by the Spaniard, with a
vast slaughter of his Men, at the Battle of St. Quintin. Designing to Honor
his Sister Margaret's Birthday with Festivals, and a Tournament, in which he
would run himself, he commanded the Count de Montgomery to run against him, as
he did; but in the Course the Count's Spear shivered in pieces, and an unlucky
Splinter thereof wounded the King so grievously in the Eye, that he died within
a few Days after, July 10. 1559. His Queen was Catharine de Medices, Daughter
of Laurence Duke of Urbin, who bore him Issue, as follows: 1. Francis II. who
indeed succeeded him, but did not long survive him; for he was Crowned King
Sept. 8. O.S. 1559. and died December. 5. the Year following. He was married to
Mary Stuart, Daughter of James V. King of Scotland, but left no Issue by her.
2. Elizabeth (or Isabella) born 1545. married to Philip II. King of Spain,
1559. deceased 1568. 3. Claudia, married Feb. 5. 1559. to Charles II. Duke of
Lorrain; deceased 1575. 4. Lewis, deceased an Infant. 5. Charles IX. born 1550.
his Brother's Successor; Crowned King May 15. 1561. His Reign is infamous for
the many bloody Battles, for the daily Sieges and Sackings of Towns and Cities;
for the Devastations of Provinces, and Slanghters of the Inhabitants,
occasioned by the Civil War that then raged in France; but above all, for the
barbarous Massacre at Paris. This Prince had Poets in great esteem, and
sometimes wrote Verses himself. He composed a Poem on Stag-Hunting, to which
Recreation he was given to a fault. Of all his Sanctions, that is most
remarkable which he published for reforming the Computation of the Year: For
whereas all other Nations began their Year from the Feast of the Circumcision,
the French alone commenced theirs from Easter, which was altered by this King.
He departed this Life 1574. in the flower of his Age, after a long and painful
Sickness. His Queen was Elizabeth, Daughter to the Emperor Maximilian II. who
bore him only a Daughter, named Mary Elizabeth, born 1572. deceased 1578. 6.
Henry III. born Sept. 19. 1551. elected King of Poland 1573. Crowned King of
France 1574. murdered by James Clement a Dominican Friar, Aug. 2. 1589. leaving
no Issue. 7. Francis Duke of Alencon and Brabant, born 1554. deceased a
Batchellor 1584. 8. Margaret, married in 1572. to Henry IV. King of Navarre,
and afterward of France; divorced from him 1600. deceased 1615. 9. Victoria,
and, Twins, born and dead the same Year, viz. 1556. 10. Joan, Twins, born and
dead the same Year, viz. 1556.


Of the Line of Bourbon.
. XIII. MAtters being thus far cleared and discussed, we shall now bring Robert
V. Son of Lewis IX. once more on the Stage, having been already mentioned in
Sect. 4. Numb. 7. His eldest Son's Name was Lewis, Count de Clermont, and Duke
of Bourbon; and his Grandson's, James de Bourbon, Count de la March and
Ponthieu, Constable of France, who died in the Year 1362. being Father of John
Count de la March, who succeeded him; and begat, 1. James II. Count de la
March, King of Naples, who died 1438, having had, by Beatrix, Daughter of
Charles III. King of Navarre, only a Daughter that survived him; namely,
Eleanor, married to Bernhard d'Armanac, Count de Pardiac. 2. Lewis de Bourbon,
Count de Vendome, of whom a little below. 3. Anne, married to John de Berry,
Count de Montpensier; and after his decease, to Lewis Barbatus, Duke of
Bavaria. 4. Mary, to John de Beine, Baron de Croix. 5. Charlotte, to John King
of Cyprus; she died 1487. 6. John de Bourbon, Baron de Carency; whose Posterity
became extinct in John de Bourbon, Baron de Carency, much about the Year 1493.


As for Lewis, the second Son, he begat John de Bourbon, Count de Vendome, who
was Father of Francis de Bourbon, Count de Vendome; born 1470, and Lewis de
Bourbon, Prince de la Roche sur Y^n; which Branch of the Family failed in Henry
de Bourbon, Duke of Montpellier, An. 1608. Francis the elder Brother departed
this Life 1493. having begat Charles Duke de Vendome, born 1489. deceased 1534.

This Charles had many Children, by Frances d'Alencon, Duchess of Beaumont,
Francis Duke of Longueville's Widow; whereof ten, whose Names follow, lived to
be Men and Women; viz.

1. Margaret, born 1516. married to Francis Duke of Cleves, 1538. 2. Anthony,
Duke de Vendome, and King of Navarre; of whom in the next Section. 3. Francis,
Count d'Enghien; born 1519. deceased without Issue 1546. 4. Magdalen, Lady
Abbess of Poictiers. 5. Charles, born 1523, and promoted to the Cardinalate, in
1566. He was likewise made Bishop of Roan; and died May 9. 1590. 6. Catharine,
and, Lady Abbesses of Secession and Chelles, 7. Renata, Lady Abbesses of
Secession and Chelles, 8. John, Duke d'Enghien; born 1528. deceased 1557. 9.
Lewis, Prince de Conde, of whose most Noble Progeny, we shall speak in the XV.
Section of this Chapter. 10. Eleaner, born 1535. deceased 1611.
. XIV. We now return to Anthony Duke of Vendome, Son of Charles Duke of
Vendome, as is objected just above. He was born in the Year 1518. and performed
many Noble and great Actions, in the Service, and under the Auspices of Francis
I. and Henry II. Kings of France. After the death of his Father in-Law Henry
II. King of Navarre, whose only Daughter and Heiress, Joan d'Albret, he had
married; he possessed himself of that Kingdom, and the Principality of Bern, or
at least as much of ^em as the Spamards had left him. He was more than once in
great danger of his Life from the Guisian Faction; yet died a natural death in
1562. leaving Issue a Son and a Daughter; namely, 1. Catharine, married to
Henry Duke of Lorrain, Jan. 30. 1599. deceased 1604. And, 2. Henry IV. surnamed
The Great, King of France and Navarre, born 1553. The Greatness of whose
Actions has totally eclipsed the Glory of the most famous Monarch that ever
Ruled in France. In the Fifteenth Year of his Age he was Head of the
Protestants in France. At Nineteen he went to the French Court at Paris, being
invited to be present at those tragic Nuptials, infamous through the whole
World, for the treacherous and bloody Massacre of so many thousand Innocent and
Noble Persons. In the same Year he took on him the Title of King of Navarre,
upon the death of his Mother the Queen. He thrice extorted Peace from the
King's Party; and by the Battle of Courtray, 1581. ( Henry III. being yet
alive) dissolved the League, entered into by the Pope, the King of Spain, and
the Guisian Faction, for the Confusion of the Protestants. After the death of
Henry III. he was Crowned King of France, but not 'till 1594. having first
professed himself a Papist. On May 4. 1610. O. S. he was assassinated and
stabbed in Paris, by that infamous Villain Francis Ravillac. His first Queen
was Margaret de Valois, Daughter of Henry II. King of France, whom he divorced:
After which, he married Mary de Medices, Daughter of Francis Great Duke of
Tuscany, deceased 1642. by whom he had Issue, as follows: 1. Lewis XIII. of
whom more in the next Section. 2. Elizabeth, married to Philip IV. King of
Spain, 1615. deceased 1644. 3. Christina, to Victor Amadeus I. Duke of Savoy;
she died 1663. 4. Gaston John Baptist. Duke of Orleans, born 1608. who was
twice married, his first Duchess being Mary of Bourbon, Daughter of Henry Duke
of Montpensier; deceased 1627. His second, Margaret of Lorrain, Daughter of
Francis Count de Vaudemont; deceased 1672. By these he had four Daughters; viz.
1. Anne Mary, Duchess of Montpensier; born 1627. now alive, and unmarried. 2.
Margaret Louise, born 1645. and married 1661. to Cosmus III. Great Duke of
Tuscany. 3. Isabella, born 1646. and married to Joseph Lewis Duke of Guise, in
1667. She is now a Widow. 4. Frances Magdalen, born 1648. married to Charles
Emanuel Duke of Savoy, 1663. deceased May 11. 1665. 5. Henrietta Maria, born
1609. married to Charles I. King of England, May 1. 1625. O. S. deceased July
31. 1669. aged Sixty.




. XV. Lewis XIII. born Sept. 27. 1601. succeeded his Father, and was Crowned
King of France, October. 18. 1610. An excellent Prince, had he not given too much
way to the Counsels of those two famous Ministers of State, Richlieu and
Mazarine. He never fought but where he conquered. In 1615. he married Anna
Maria Mauritia, Daughter of Philip III. King of Spain, whom he had betrothed in
1611. And by her left Issue, 1. LEWIS XIV. surnamed The Great, the present King
of France, born Aug. 26. O.S. 1638. of whom below. And, 2. Philip, Duke of
Orleans, Sept. 21. N.S. 1640. whose first Duchess, the Princess Henrietta
Maria Stuart, Daughter of Charles I. King of England, departed this Life in
June, 1670. And he, the next Year, married Charl^tte Elizabeth, Daughter of
Charles Lewis Elector Palatine. By the first Venture he had, 1. Mary Aloisia
(or Louise) born March 27. 1662. married November. 17. 1679. to Charles II. King
of Spain; deceased without Issue by him, 1689. 2. Philip, deceased an Infant.
3. Another Daughter not named, 1665. 4. Anne Mary, born Aug. 27. 1669. and most
happily married, April 9. to Victor Amadeus II. Duke of Savoy.



He has also a Son and a Daughter by the present Duchess; namely, 1. Philip,
Duke of Chartres, born Aug. 2. 1674. And, 2. Elizabeth Charlotte, Mademoiselle
de Chartres, born Sept. 13. 1676.


As for Lewis the Great, the present King, he succeed his Father in 1643. and
was Crowned by the Archbishop of Rheims, June 7. 1654. of whose Actions I shall
say little here, since the Eyes of the whole World are upon 'em. His Queen was
Maria Theresia, Daughter of Philip IV. King of Spain, who died July 30. 1683.
by whom he has only a Son now living, namely,

Lewis XV. surnamed The Hardy, the present Dauphin; born Nov. 1. 1661. In 1680.
he married Maria Anna Christina, Daughter of Ferdinand Maria, late Elector of
Bavaria; by whom he has had three Sons; whose Names are, 1. Lewis, Duke of
Burgundy, born Aug. 6. 1682. 2. Philip, Duke of Anjou, born November. 19. 1683.
And, 3. Gaston, Duke of Berry, born Aug. 31. 1686.


But besides the Dauphin, the present French King has several Natural Children;
as namely, Mary Anne de Bourbon, born 1666. and married in 1680. to Lewis of
Bourbon, Prince de Conti: And Lewis de Bourbon, born 1667. Supreme Intendant of
the Marine. These two were born him by Aloisia Frances de la Beaume la Blanch
de la Valiere, Duchess de Vaujour, and Peeress of France, Daughter of Laurence
de la Valiere, now a Carmelite Nun, by the Name of Sister Aloisia de
Misericordia (or of Mercy.) As likewise Lewis Augustus de Bourbon, Duke of
Main, born 1670. and made legitimate three Years after. Lewis Caesar de
Bourbon, Count de Vexin, born 1672. deceased 1683. Aloisia Frances de Bourbon,
Mademoiselle de Nantes, born 1673. and married in 1685. to Lewis Duke of
Bourbon. Aloisia Mary Anne, deceased 1681. Lewis Alexander de Bourbon, Count de
Toulouse, born 1678. made Legitimate 1681. Intendant likewise of the Marine.
And Frances Mary de Bourbon, Mademoiselle de Rlois, born 1681. Which Six were
born him by Frances Athanasia de Rochechouart, Gabriel Prince de Mortemar's
Daughter, and Wife of Henry de Lewis Paidaillan, Marquess of Montespan.

. XVI. It remains we now return to Lewis Prince de Conde, youngest Son of
Charles Duke of Vendome, born 1530. whom we mentioned in the latter end of
Sect. XIII. Numb. 9. He was slain at the bloody Battle of Jarnac, 1569. by one
Montesque, a Captain under the Duke of Anjou, notwithstanding he offered 100000
Crowns for his Ransom. The Issue that survived him were, 1. Henry, Prince of
Conde; born 1552. 2. Francis, Prince of Conti; born 1558. who had only Natural
Issue, though twice married. 3. Charles, Archbishop of Roan, and Cardinal;
deceased 1594. 4. Charles, Count de Soissons, Peer and Grand Master of France;
born 1566. deceased 1614. leaving Issue, 1. Aloisia, married to Henry Duke of
Longueville; deceased 1637. 2. Lewis, born 1604. deceased 1641. And, 3. Mary,
born 1606. and married to Thomas of Savoy, Prince of Carignan.



Henry, the eldest Brother, was a Prince of great Courage, and has his Life
finely written by Thuanus, in his History, Lib. 90. His first Princess was Mary
of Cleve, Daughter of Francis Duke of Nevers: But she dying in 1574. he
afterward married Charlotte Catharine de Tremolle, Daughter of Lewis Duke of
Thovars; and departed this Life 1588. leaving Issue by the last Lady, as
follows; namely, 1. Eleanora, born 1587. married in 1606. to Philip William
of Nassau, Prince of Orange; deceased 1619. And, 2. Henry II. Prince of Conde;
born after his Father's decease, Sept. 1. 1588. His Princess was Charlotte
Margaret, Daughter of Henry II. Duke of Montmorency, who bore him, 1. Anne,
married in 1642. to Henry Duke of Longueville; deceased 1679. 2. Lewis II.
Prince of Conde. And, 3. Armand, Prince of Conti; of which two apart. And first
for Lewis:



He was born in 1621. and justly to be ranked among the greatest Hero's of the
Age. He took to Wife Clara Clementia, Daughter of Urban Marquess of Breze; and
departed this Life 1685. to the great Grief of all good Men. His only Son

Henry Julius de Bourbon, is now living; born July 29. 1643. formerly styled
Duke d'Enghien; but now, since his Father's death, Prince of Conde. His
Princess is Anne, Daughter of Edward Prince Palatine of the Rhine; who has born
him this following Issue now living: 1. Mary Theresia, Mademoiselle de Bourbon;
born 1666. 2. Lewis, Duke of Bourbon; born 1668. and married 1685. to Aloisia
Frances, Natural Daughter of the present French King. 3. Mary Anne,
Mademoiselle de Montmorency; born 1675. 4. Anne Mary Victoria, Mademoiselle
d'Enghien; born 1676. And, 5. Aloisia Benedicta, Mademoiselle de Conde; born
1678.


As for Armand, Prince de Conti, the other Brother; he was born 1629. married
to Anne Mary of Montmorency, Cardinal Mazarine's Neice by the Sister, 1654.
deceased 1666. leaving two Sons: 1. Lewis de Bourbon, Prince of Conti; born
1661. In 1680. he took to Wife Mary Anne de Bourbon, the King's Natural
Daughter, made legitimate; yet died without Issue in 1685. And, 2. Francis
Lewis de Bourbon, the now Prince of Conti; born 1668.


Of the Augmentation of the House of France.
. XVII. IN the Year 861. Robert Earl of Orleans was created Duke and Marquess
of the Franks, by Charles the Bald, King of France; to whose Son Eudo, the
County of Paris was likewise added, by Charles the Gross. King of France. After
this, Hugh Capet came to be King, An. 987. whose Brother Otho having married
Leutgarde, Daughter and Heiress to the last Duke of Burgundy, in her Right
possessed himself of that Duchy. Philip II. having defeated John (sans Terre)
King of England, brought Normandy, Bretagne, Anjou, Touraine, Poictou, and
Clermont, with part of Aquitain, under his Obedience, and incorporated the same
with the Crown. Charles Duke of Anjou was Crowned King of both the Sicily's,
An. 1266. He likewise became possessed of Provence in Right of his Wife; as
also of a Title to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, by the Donation of Mary Princess
of Antioch. Charles Martel, his Grandson, was Crowned King of Hungary, in 1290.
in right of his Mother Mary, Daughter of Stephen King of Hungary. Lewis his Son
became King of Poland, by a Marriage with Elizabeth, Daughter of Ladislaus King
of that Country. And Philip, Charles Martel's Brother, took upon him the Title
of Emperor of Constantinople, in his Wife's Right. Lewis IX. obtained
Clermont, Toulouse, and Provence, by the same Right; Beaumont by Gift, and
Mascon for Money. Philip the Fair bought the County of Canny; and joined the
Kingdom of Navarre to that of France, by a Marriage with Joan last Heiress
thereof; with whom he had Champagne also, and the Territory of Bruges. Philip
VI. surnamed de Valois, had Dauphine given him: but bought the Lordship of
Mompellier in Languedoc, of Sanchius King of Majorca. Charles V. did the same
by Auxerre; Picena, part of Dreux, Creil, and Mouzon; all which Places he
annexed to the Crown. In 1345. Philip Duke of Burgundy, third Son of King John,
added the Counties of Artois, Burgundy, and Flanders, as also the Duchy of
Brabant, to this Family; partly as his Mother's Inheritance, and partly as his
Wife's. After this, Charles the Bold succeeded to the Duchy of Burgundy as
next Heir, and so became Lord of all the Netherlands. In 1389. Lewis II. Son of
Charles V. became possessed of the Duchy of Milan, in right of his Wife
Valentina, Daughter and Heiress of John Galeazo Duke thereof. In 1535. Francis
I. annexed the Duchy of Bretagne to the Crown. Henry IV. gave the Kingdom of
Navarre once more to the Crown, together with the Principality of Bern, the
Dutchies of Vendome, Beaumont, and Albret; the Counties of Foix and Armanac,
Perigord, and Bresse, with many other Places: So that all France became
incorporated in the Crown. Last of all, Lewis XIV. the present King, has made
himself Master of the Bishoprics of Metz, Tulles, and Verdun; Pignerol,
Brisac, all Alsace, and Brisgow. By the Pyrenaean Treaty he had the County of
Rousillon, with part of that of Cerdagne, made over to him: See Artic. 42. and
43. Moreover, he has bought Casal, the Capital City of Montferrat. By the
Treaty of Peace at Nimeguen, he was put in possession of Freiburg. Two Years
after, he made himself Master of Strasburg by force of Arms, viz. September. 29.
1681. as he had done seven Years before, of the Dutchies of Bar and Lorrain;
which two last he has united to the Crown for ever. He has likewise taken the
Palatinate of Deux Pents from its Natural Prince, under pretense of its being
an Appendant of Alsace. Nor have the Dukes of Wirtenberg escaped him, from whom
he forced Mompelgart; as also Orange from the Prince of that Name. In short,
the Fronch of late years have extended their Power as far as America, where
they stand possessed of New-France, and Isles of St. Christopher and
Martinique; as also that of St. Laurence near Africa. Moreover, they seem of
late to have gotten footing in Siam in the East-India's.

Of its Decrease.
. XVIII. THe greatest Diminution suffered by the Family of Capet, has been from
the English; who beginning a War with the Line of Valois, under the Conduct of
King Edward III. about the Year 1338. subdued (in a manner) all France.
Nevertheless, in process of time all was regained by the French; so that now
the English have not so much as a Foot of Land in France. In 1477. Mary, the
only Daughter and Heiress of Charles the Bold (last Duke of Burgundy of this
Family) being married to Maximilian I transferred the Franche Comte, together
with all the Netherlands; and indeed all other her Possessions, except the
Duchy of Burgundy, to the House of Austria. Nevertheless, the French by
degrees have recovered many of these Places, and still are gaining more, as,
namely, Artois, with great part of Haynault and Flanders, by the Pyrenaean
Treaty of Peace: See the 35th. and following Articles: By the Peace of
Nimeguen, the Franche Comte; and since that, the Duchy of Luxenburg. They have
also made themselves Masters of some Cities belonging to the United Provinces;
and bought Dunkirk of the English. But then again for its Decrease: In 1281.
this Family lost the Kingdom of Sicily, witness the famous Sicilian Vespers; at
which time it lost Malta also. Joan, the last Queen of Naples, of the Family of
Capet, transferred that Kingdom to Alphonso King of Arragon. Hedewig descended
of the same Race, last Heiress of the Kingdom of Poland, brought in Marriage
that Kingdom to Jagello, Duke of Lithuania. In 1512. the Kingdom of Navarre was
torn from it by the Spaniard; and the Duchy of Milan lost about ten Years
after, to Charles V. who invested his Son Philip therein. Last of all, the
present French King has again freely surrendered the County of Avignon, to his
Holiness, Pope Alexander VIII. (alias Ottoboni.) By all which it appears what
Regions and Provinces are at present subject to the French King; yet consult at
leisure the famous John Christ. Beckman's Hist. Civ. c. 3.. 2.

Of its Pretensions.
. XIX. THe House of France seems, in the first place, to have a just Title to
the Upper Kingdom of Navarre, as taken from King John of Albret, by Ferdinand
the Catholic, King of Spain, at the Instigation of Pope Julius II. whereas the
Right and Title thereunto, was by Joan of Albret's being married to Anthony of
Bourbon, Father of King Henry the Great, transferred into that Family; and the
Claim suspended 'till this day.

2. To the Commonwealth of Genoua, by reason of a voluntary and formal
Surrender of its Sovereignty, in 1396. to Charles VI. King of France; which has
been since often claimed.

3. To the Kingdom of Naples; which nevertheless seems to be but weak, and is
wholly rejected by the Spaniards.

4. To the Duchy of Milan; Valentina, the Heiress of that Duchy, being
married by Lewis Duke of Orleans, second Son of Charles V. And,

Lastly, The present King, in name of his Brother Philip, Duke of Orleans, lays
claim to great part of the Palatinate of the Rhine: And this has been the
occasion of the present bloody and expensive War.

CHAP. III. Of the Lineage of the Kings of England.
. I. WHat the first State or Form of England was, how conquered by the Romans,
and afterward by the Saxons, makes so little to the present Undertaking, that
we purposely leave it; it being as much as we shall have occasion for, That
about the Year 1016. Canutus (or Knute) King of Denmark, invaded this Kingdom;
and having treacherously slain the Saxon King, Edmond Ironside, 1018. married
Emma, the Widow of King Ethelred, Father of the said Edmond; and was the first
Danish King of England, and died 1038.

His Issue were, 1. Harold, surnamed Harefoot, by a former Wife. 2.
Hardicanute, by the said Emma.


Harold succeeded his Father, and died without Issue 1041. and left the
Succession to his said Brother, by the Father's side,

Hardicanute, who by means of his Luxury, became odious to the People; and in
the midst of a Debauch, died suddenly, 1042. lest no Issue; and with him ended
the Government of the Danes in England. To him succeeded his Brother, by the
Mother's side,

Edward, surnamed The Confessor, the Son of Ethelred, by Emma the Mother of
Hardicanute, as before. He had been preserved from Canute, by Richard II. Duke
of Normandy, his Uncle; and upon the death of Hardicanute, was recalled from
Normandy, and Crowned King in the Year 1042 and Fortieth of his Age. He first
brought into the Royal Family the Gift of curing The King's Evil: Reigned
Twenty four Years, and died without Issue 1065. Upon this,

Harold II. Son of Earl Godwin, by Guitha, Sifter of Swain King of Denmark, by
the assistance of Edwin and Morcar, Earls of York and Chester, was preferred to
the Crown; but enjoyed it not long, for he was slain in Battle, October. 14.
1066. by

. II. William I. Duke of Normandy, surnamed The Conqueror; first of the
Normans that was King of England; Natural Son of Robert II. Duke of Normandy,
by Arletta, an obscure Woman; who under pretense that Edward the Confessor had,
by his last Will and Testament, transferred the Kingdom to him, made a Descent
into England; and having slain Harold, as before, was, by the unanimous Consent
of the Peerage of England, Crowned King, 1067. He had a sharp War with Philip
I. King of France; and after Twenty one Years Reign, died at Roan in Normandy,
September. 9. 1087. He had to Wife Maud, Daughter of Baldwin V. Earl of Flanders;
by whom he had six Daughters and four Sons 1. Cecilie, Abbess of Caen in
Normandy. 2. Constance, married to the Earl of Britain. 3. Adela, to Stephen
Earl of Blois, Father of King Stephen; of whom in his turn. 4. Gundred, to
William Warren, first Earl of Surry. 5. Ela, both died young. 6. Margaret, both
died young.


His Sons were, 1. Robert, to whom he bequeathed the Duchy of Normandy. 2.
Richard, killed by a Stagg in New Forest, in his Father's Lifetime. 3. William
surnamed Rufus, who succeeded his Father in the Kingdom. 4. Henry I. surnamed
Beauclerk, to whom he left his Treasure, and a yearly Pension; of whom more in
the next Section.


II. William II. born in Normandy 1057. his Brother Robert being in Normandy,
at the time of his Father's death, what by pretext of his Father's Will, and
the contrivance of Lanfranc Archbishop of Canterbury, was Crowned, October. 5.
following. He had War with the Scots; brought Wales under his Obedience; but
what with that, and to secure his Possession against the Claim and Arms of his
elder Brother Robert, he was necessitated to many a dishonorable Shift whereby
to get Money; and at last struck dead with an Arrow, shot by Sir Walter Tyrel,
a Norman, his Bow-Bearer, as they were Hunting in New Forest (but whether by
accident, or otherwise, is uncertain,) Aug. 2. 1100. being the Eleventh Year of
his Reign, and Forty third of his Age; but never married.

III. Henry. I. youngest Son of the Conqueror, born in England 1070. his eldest
Brother Robert still living (but in favor of Henry, given out to be chosen
King of Jerusalem) succeeded his Brother William, and was Crowned in four Days
after his death. He had long Wars with his Brother Robert, upon his return from
the Holy War; 'till at last having taken him Prisoner, he put out his Eyes, and
threw him in Prison, where he died; but left no Issue. He called the first
Parliament, after the Conquest, at Salisbury, in 1115. and died of a Surfeit in
Normandy, December. 2. 1136. in the Sixty seventh Year of his Age, and Thirty
fifth of his Reign. His first Wife was Matilda, or Maud, Daughter of Malcolm
III. King of Scotland, by Margaret the Sister of Edgar Atheling, right Heir of
Edward the Confessor, as being descended from Edmond Ironside, of whom before;
by which means the Saxon Line was restored in her Issue, 1. William, born 1102.
he married Matilda (or Maud) Daughter of Foulk Earl of Anjon; who with several
others were cast away, Nov. 26. 1119. 2. Maud, the only legitimate Issue that
survived him, born 1104. she was first married to the Emper our Henry IV. 1110.
and after his death, to Jeoffry Plantaganet Earl of Anjou, 1124. (so called
from a Sprig of Broom which he wore in his Cap, or Bonnet) by whom she had King
Henry II.


His second Wife was Adeliza, Daughter of Jeoffry Duke of Lorrain, by whom he
had no Issue.

He had seven Natural Sons: 1. Robert, Earl of Gloucester; a Person of great
Direction, and indefatigable Industry, as appeared by the valiant Assistance he
gave his said Sister Maud, against King Stephen. 2. Richard, drowned with his
Brother William, 1117. 3. Reinald, Earl of Cornwall, and Baron of Castle-Combe.
Nor is there any particular mention of the other Four.


And as many Natural Daughters,

Of whom it is only said, they were all of them honorably bestowed in Marriage.

. III. William, only Son of Henry I. being lost (as before) and himself not
having Issue by his second Wife, he now began to think of settling the
Succession; and to that purpose called another Paaliament, 1133. in which, all
the Lords of the Land took an Oath to be true to his Daughter Maud the Empress,
and her Heirs, and acknowledge them as right Inheritors of the Crown: And
amongst them,

IV. Stephen, born 1107. Earl of Belogne and Montague, Son of Stephen Earl of
Blois, by Adela, third Daughter of the Conqueror, was one; yet by the working
of Henry (his Brother) Bishop of Winchester, the Pope's Legate, a Man
acceptable to the Nobility, at that time altogether governed by the Clergy, he
was set up to the Crown, against the undoubted Right of the said Empress, and
Crowned on St. Stephen's Day, 1135. His first War was with the Scots; but
during most of his Reign, under various Fortune with the said Empress, 'till
(his Children being dead) he secured the Succession to her Son Henry. He died
October. 25. 1154. in the Forty ninth Year of his Age, and Nineteenth of his
Reign; and had to Wife Maud, Daughter and Heir of Eustace Earl of Bologne; by
whom he had, 1. Eustace, who died in the Eighteenth Year of his Age. 2.
William, who died younger.


His Natural Issue.

1. William, Earl of Norfolk. 2. Gervais, Abbot of Westminster, who died 1160.
V.. IV. To him succeeded Henry II. surnamed Fitz Empress, first of the Line of
Plantagenet; born at Mentz in Normandy, 1131. Crowned King December. 7. 1155. He
sought to abate the Power of the Clergy, the Effects of which he had felt in
the Exclusion of his Mother, and advancement of King Stephen; but it wrought
him great Troubles, particularly with Thomas Becket Archbishop of Canterbury
(touching the Exemption of Clerks from the Secular Power) and the Consequence
of it stuck to his Family for Sixty Years after. He Crowned his Son Henry King,
June 14. 1170. in the Seventeenth Year of his Age: Sent Strongbow Earl of
Chcapstow into Ireland in the same Year, who planted the first Colony of
English in Wexford: went over thither in 1172. Conquered it, and wrote himself
LORD thereof. He suffered much by his Sons Henry and Richard: The former broke
with him 1173. and died 1183. his Father living. The other combined with the
King of France against him, 1188. in which also he engaged his Brother John;
which so struck to his Heart, that he died of Grief in Normandy, and rather
burst than bowed to Fortune, July 9. 1189. in the Sixty first Year of his Age,
and Thirty fourth of his Reign. His Wife was Eleanor, Daughter of William Duke
of Acquitain, divorced from Lewis VII. King of France; by whom he had three
Daughters: 1. Maud, married to Henry Duke of Saxony. 2. Eleanor, to Alphonso
VIII. King of Castile. 3. Joan, to William King of Sicily.


And six Sons.

1. William, who died young. 2. Henry, of whom before; married to Margaret,
Daughter of Lewis VII. King of France; but died without Issue. 3. Richard, who
succeeded his Father; born 1155. 4. Jeoffry, Earl of Britain; married to
Constance, Daughter of Conan Earl of Richmond; by whom he had Arthur, Earl of
Britain, Angiers, and Richmond. 5. Philip, who died young. 6. John, who
succeeded his Brother Richard.
His Natural Sons: 1. William, surnamed Longespee, or Long-sword, Earl of
Salisbury, in right of his Wife Ela, Daughter and Heir of William Earl of that
Place. 2. Jeoffry Archbishop of York; who after a five Years banishment by his
Brother King John, died 1213. Both by Rosamond. 3. Morgan, Provost of Beverly,
Bishop Elect of Durham. By the Lady Blewet.


VI. Richard I. born at Oxford, 1155. surnamed Coeur de Lycn, succeeded his
Father, and was Crowned September. 3. 1189. He made an Expedition into the Holy
Land the same Year; and in his return through Austria, was imprisoned by the
Emperor Henry VI. to whom he resigned his Crown; nor yet discharged, without
the payment of 100000 Marks; which was accepted, notwithstanding the large
Profers of the King of France, and his Brother John, to have him detained. Upon
his coming home, he was Crowned a second time, and made War with France, where
he was slain with a barbed Arrow, by one Bertram, at the Siege of Chalons in
Limosin, April 6. 1199. in the Forty fourth Year of his Age, and Ninth of his
Reign. He had to Wife Beringuel, Daughter of the King of Navarre; but died
without Issue. After him,

VII. John, surnamed Sans Terre; born 1166. youngest Son of Henry II.
notwithstanding the just Right of Arthur his elder Brother's Son, by the means
of Hubert Archbishop of Canterbury, obtained the Crown; and was Crowned by him
upon Ascension day, 1199. On this, Arthur made War upon him in Anjou; besieged
Mirabel, defended by Eleanor, Mother of King John, who raised the Siege,
defeated Arthur, took him Prisoner, and had him murdered in Prison, 1202. He
lost at that time Normandy to the King of France (who took part with Arthur)
after a Three hundred Years possession by his Ancestors. Upon the death of
Hubert, Stephen Langton, a Cardinal, being imposed on him for Archbishop of
Canterbury, is refused by him, 1207. The Monks of Canterbury accept him; the
King expels them as Traitors: The Kingdom is interdicted, 1208. himself
excommunicated, 1210. and his Kingdom given to the King of France, 1213. He
submits, and surrenders his Kingdoms of England and Ireland to Pope Innocent
III. and became his Feudatory for them at the yearly Tribure of a thousand
Marks, payable to the said Pope and his Successors; does Homage and Fealty for
them to Pandulphus his Legate, gives up his Crown to him, and receives it again
two days after. This Charter bore date May 15. 1213. and was casually lost by
fire, at the Council of Lions; but never were any Moneys paid upon it, or ever
demanded, since 1366. 40th. Edward III. at what time also it was refused. He
was absolved from his Excommunication the same Year; and the King of France,
upon pain of like Excommunication, forbidden to proceed further against him, as
having submitted himself to the Church; and the Jurisdiction, which had now
lasted six Years, or better, released: Yet his Barons cease not to infest him,
and force two Charters from him; to wit, Magna Charta, and Charta de Foresta,
1214, which the Pope nulls, and excommunicates the Barons. They, on the other
hand, bring in Lewis, the King of France his Son, who landed May 1. 1216, whom
Guallo, the Pope's Legate, excommunicates. In 1210. he erected the Mayoralty of
London, and further granted to them to have two Sheriffs and a Common Council.
And notwithstanding all Turmoils at home, settled Ireland, and brought the
English Laws and Coin into that Kingdom; and died October. 19. 1216. in the Fifty
first Year of his Age, and Seventeenth of his Reign; and (as some have said) by
Poison. He had three Wives; his first was Alice, Daughter of Hubert Earl of
Morton. He was divorced from his second, the Daughter of Robert Earl of
Gloucester, upon the score of Consanguinity; and married Isabel, Daughter and
Heir of Ailmer Earl of Angolesme; by whom only he had Issue three Daughters and
two Sons.

His Daughters: 1. Joan, married to Alexander II. King of Scots. 2. Eleanor, to
William Earl of Pembroke; and afterward to Simon de Montford Earl of
Leicester. 3. Isabella, to the Emperor Frederick II.


His Sons: 1. Henry, who succeeded him in the Kingdom. 2. Richard, Earl of
Cornwall; Crowned King of the Romans 1257. died 1274.


As also three Natural Children: 1 Joan, married to Llewellin Prince of Wales.
2. Jeoffry Fitz-Roy, who served in France. 3. Richard, who married the Daughter
and Heir of Fulbert de Dover.


VIII. To him succeeded Henry III. born 1208. Crowned in nine days after the
death of his Father, and committed to the Tutelage of William Earl of Pembroke,
Great Marshal of England; by whose prudent Management, several of the most
eminent Barons for sook Lewis, and returned to their Allegiance; and with the
rest of the Kingdom that stood firm to their young King, drove him from place
to place, and at last gave him a total Rout; upon which, he came to an Accord,
and quitted the Kingdom. In the Ninth of his Reign, he confirmed the Charters
granted by his Father; which afterward he endeavored to rescind, as done in
his minority, The most of his Reign was full of Troubles with his Barons,
headed by the late mentioned Simon de Montfort, a French Exile; but got into
that favor, that he was made Earl of Leicester, and married the King's Sister
(as before;) yet with the Earl of Gloucester and others, he fights the King at
a place called Lewis, where they made him and Prince Edward his Son, Prisoners,
1264. They quarrel about the Dividend: The Prince makes his escape, 1265.
Gloucester joins him, and gives Leicester Battle, in which the latter is slain.
After which, the King lived seven Years, approved himself a wise Prince, and
died Nov 16. 1272. in the Sixty fifth Year of his Age, and Fifty sixth of his
Reign. He had to Wife Eleanor, second Daughter of Raymond Earl of Provence; by
whom he had two Daughters and six Sons.

His Daughters: 1. Margaret, married to Alexander III. King of Scots. 2.
Beatrice. to John I. Duke of Bretain.


Of his Sons, two only survived him: 1. Edward I. who succeeded his Father. 2.
Edmond, surnamed Crouch back, Earl of Lancaster, Father of Thomas, who had
Issue Henry Earl of Lancaster, whose Daughter Blanch was married to John of
Gaune, fourth Son of King Edward III. of whom more hereafter.


IX.. V. Edward I. born 1240. surnamed Longshanks, had under taken the Cross,
and was in the Holy Land when his Father died: However, he is proclaimed King,
and Fealty sworn to him, though it were not known whether he were living or dead.
Upon his return, he was Crowned Aug. 15. 1274. He had found by Experience the
Ecclesiastical Power too strong for the Sovereignty, whenever they combined
with the Lay-Nobility; and therefore retrenched them of their Privileges,
whilst he was in the Opinion and Estimation of the World; and in 1275. got the
Statute of Mortmain to be enacted, whereby to hinder the increase of their
Temporal Possessions; and not long after, clipped the Jurisdiction of
Ecclesiastical Judges. He slew Leoline, the last of the Welsh Princes, in
Battle, and united Wales to the Crown of England, 1283. He banished the Jews,
and vacated all their Sureties, 1293. He was made Umpire between John Baliol
and Robert Bruce, for the Crown of Scotland; and determined for Baliol, who did
him Homage, 1294. which he afterward renounced; but upon the King's entry into
Scotland, submits, and is sent Prisoner into England. However, the Scots being
gotten together under Wallace their Head, the King pursued his Enterprise; gave
them a total Rout at a place called Fenkirk; and having abolished their ancient
Laws, returned, and brought all their Records, and other Evidences of Antiquity
with him, 1299. On this, Robert Bruce, Son of Robert the Competitor, gets into
Scotland, where he is received and Crowned, 1306. Is defeated by the Earl of
Pembroke, 1307. Bruce recovers new Forces; the King reenters Scotland, and
dies of a Flux, July 7. the same Year, being the Sixty eighth of his Age, and
Thirty fifth of his Reign. His first Wife was Eleanor, Daughter of Ferdinand
III. King of Castile, by whom he had nine Daughters: 1. Eleanor, married to
John Earl of Bar. 2. Joan, to Gilbert Earl of Gloucester, 3. Margaret, to John
Duke of Brabant. 4. Mary, a Nun of Amsbury. 5. Elizabeth, to John Earl of
Holland; and after him, to Humphrey Bohun Earl of Hereford. The rest died young.


Of his Four Sons,

Only Edward survived him, and was the first Prince of Wales. His second Wife
was Margaret, eldest Daughter of Philip the Bold, King of France; by whom he
had two Sons: 1. Thomas of Brotherton, Lord Marshal of England, and Earl of
Norfolk. 2. Edmond, Earl of Kent; beheaded 1328. for endeavoring the
Restoration of his deposed Brother King Edward II.


X. Edward II. born at Carnarvan 1285. created Prince of Wales, March 15. 1304.
Crowned Feb. 24. 1307. In 1308. he caused all the Knights Templars throughout
England and Ireland, to be apprehended, and their Order to be dissolved; as
afterward were the Knights of Rhodes by King Henry VIII. 1540. and their Lands
and Possessions seized. He seems to have come in with much Expectation, but
soon lost it, by means of a Favorite of his, Pierce Gaveston, banished by his
Father, but re called by him, and made Earl of Cornwall, Lord of Man, and High
Chamberlain; which so incensed the Nobility, that the King is forced to banish
him more than once; but as often re-calling him. They take Arms under Thomas
Earl of Lancaster their Leader, Son of Edmond, second Son of King Henry III.
(whom the Mobb called King Arthur) and having taken him at Scarborough Castle,
strike off his Head, 1312. During this Disorder at home, Bruce was become
powerful in Scotland; the King enters upon him with a vast Army, and is totally
routed by him, at a place called Bannock-Bourn, 1314. This (and his making Hugh
Spencer Earl of Gloucester, Son of Hugh Spencer Earl of Winchester, Successor
in the Office and Favor of the said Gaveston) so heightened the former
Discontent, which was in a manner allayed, that both sides arm anew: But the
King gets the better, takes the Earl of Lancaster, and beheads him before his
own Castle of Pomfret, 1322. Yet this lasted not long; for having sent the
Queen and his Son the Prince into France, instead of accommodating Matters, she
contracts her Son to Philippa, Daughter of William III. Earl of Hainault, by
whose and the Earl of Holland's assistance, she returns with an Army, and with
her the Prince, and Roger Mortimer Lord of Wigmore, lately escaped out of the
Tower of London; but afterward made Earl of the Marches of Wales, by King
Edward III. And having taken Bristol, with Hugh Spencer the Father in it, she
caused him to be hanged and quartered (without Trial) 1326. The King, Spencer
the Son, and others, had put to Sea for Ireland; but were beaten upon the Coast
of Wales, where they lay hid for a while in the Abbey of Neth; but being
discovered. Spencer had the same fate with his Father. The King was imprisoned,
and a Parliament called to meet at London; where (upon several Articles
exhibited against him) it is agreed to depose him as unfit to Govern, and elect
the Prince his Son. Upon which, he voluntarily resigned his Crown to him, 1327.
in the Nineteenth Year of his Reign. About eight Months after which, he was
most barbarously murdered in Berkley Castle, in the ^^^^ty third Year of his
Age. His Wife was (...), Laughter of Philip the Fair; by whom ^he had, 1. Joan,
married to David Prince of Scotland. 2. Eleanor, to the Dake of Gelders.


And two Sons.

1. Edward, born at Windsor, 1313. set up to the Crown, his Father yet living.
2. John of Eltham, created Earl of Cornwall, 1315. and died in the flower of his
Youth in Scotland.
XI. Upon the Resignation of Edward II. his Son Edward III. of the Age of
Fourteen Years, began his Reign Jan. 20. 1327, and was Crowned the 25th.
following. The Queen seems heavy at it; but being pacified by a^ Augmentation
of Jointure, the management of Assairs is committed to five Bishops, and seven
Temporal Lords, 'till the King were or Years to Govern; but the Queen and
Mortimer act all. The Scots enter England, and are suffered to escape; and in
1328. a dishonest rabble Peace is made with them: To confirm which, Joan, the
King's Sister, is married to David Pruce Prince of Scotland; and amongst other
things, the Ragman Roll, and Black-Cros^ of Scotland, are given back to them;
and the King, by the working of the Queen and M^^timer, surrenders his Title to
the Sovereignty of Scotland, and all Evidences relating thereunto: For which,
Mortimer is impeached is Parliament, and hanged at Tyburn. Nor laster the Peace
long; for Edward Baliol, Son of the aforesaid John Baliol, sets up for that
Crown and by King Edward's Assistance recovers it and does him Homage, and
swears Fealty for it, 1333. And now there happening some disgust between him
and Philip de Valois King of France, he bethinks himself of his Title to the
Crown, in right of Isabel his Mother; (...) which, the Banishment of Robert de
Artois by King Philip his Brother, who fled for safety to him, gave him a fair
Opportunity. Nor was he wanting to it; for he not only received him joy^ully,
but made him Earl of Richmend and of his Council, 1336. which he lived not long
to enjoy, for after six years serving him in France, he was wounded at the
Siege of Vanner, and brought to England, where he died, 1342. The Year
following he instituted the Order of the Garter, and created his eldest Son
Edward Prince of Wales. In July, 1346. he enters Normandy with a mighty Army,
and takes the Prince with him, who (not full Sixteen) fought the Battle of
Cressy in Picardy, on St. Bartholomew's Day, the same Year; and obtained so
great a Victory, that Callice was forthwith besieged, and surrendered Aug. 3.
1347. On which, the King took the Title and Arms of France, and returned for
England, where the Prince; Electors signify to him, That they had chosen him
King of the Romans; which he refused. In the Year 1356. the Prince goes over
again, fights the Battle of Poictiers in Poictou, and takes John the French
King Prisoner, September. 19. the same Year: Returns for England, brings the said
King with him; whence he was not delivered 'till 1360. at what time, an Accord
had been made on his behalf at Britigny near Chartres. During this Cessation
with France, the Prince of Wales, accompanied with his Brother John of Gaunt,
Duke of Lancaster, relieves Peter King of Castile and Leon, expuls'd by his
Bastard-Brother Henry, and restored him, 1367. But little of the Accord with
France being performed, the King (upon his return) sends the Prince into
Acquitain, and in a short time the said Duke John, and his younger Brother,
Edmond Earl of Cambridge, to aid him; to whom (his Health failing him) he left
the profecution of the War, and returned himself, 1371. Nor did his Brother
John much after him, save that coming for England, he (by reason of the
Prince's sickness) wholly managed his aged Father; which being taken notice of
by some of the Prince's Friends, he is ban^^^'d the Court. Not long after
which, the Prince died, 1375 being the Forty ninth of his Father's Reign, and
Forty sixth of his Age. His Wise was Joan, Daughter of Edmond Earl of Kent, his
Father's Brother; by whom he had, 1. Edward, born at Angoulesm, and died young.
2. Richard, born at Bourdeaux, who succeeded his Grandfather.


As also two Natural Sons: 1. Sir John Sounder. 2. Sir Reger Clarendon, put to
death by Henry IV. for endeavoring the Restoration of his said Brother
Richard, 1402.


And now after the Prince's death, the Duke of Lancaster came in play again,
and openly favored John Wickliffe, to the great disturbance of the State; and
therefore lest he might do by Richard of B^urdeaux, as Earl John had done by
his Nephew Arthur, the King providently settled the Succession, in Parliament,
upon the said Richard, creating him first Earl of Cheste and C^rnwal, and then
Prince of Wales; and died June 21. 1377. in the Sixty fourth Year of his Age,
and Fiftieth of his Reign. He had to Wise Philippa of Haynault, who bore him

Have Daughters: 1. Isabel, married to Ingelram, Lord of Coue^. Earl of
S^^^^^ns and Bedford; afterward, Archduke of Austria. 2. Joan, to Alphonso II.
of Castile, by Proxy, but die before it was consummated. 3. Mary, to John
Menserd Duke of Bretagne 4. Margaret, to John Hastings Earl of Pembr^^^; but
died without Issae. 5. Also another Daughter Blanch, who died young.


And seven Sons.

1. Edward, surnamed The Black Prince, of whom before. 2. William, surnamed Of
Hatfield, the Place of his Birth. He died young. 3. Lionel, born at Antwerp,
1338. made Earl of Ulster in Ireland, in right of his Wise Elizabeth, Daughter
of William Burgh Earl of Ulster; with whom also he had the Honor of Clare in
the County of Thoumond, in that Kingdom, and thence created Dake of Clarence.
She brought him one Daughter only,
Philippa, married to Edmond Mortimer Eail of March, Mother of Reger Earl of
March, Father of Anne Countess of Cambridge, Grandmother of King Edward IV.

4 John, surnamed Of Gaunt, where he was hom, 1342. Created Duke of Lancaster,
1352. He had three Wives: 1. Blanch, Daughter and Heir of Henry Earl of
Lancaster, Son of Edmond Crouch back, youngest Son of King Henry III. as
before; by whom he had

Henry of Bullenbrook, Earl of Derby, who usurped upon Richard II. and was the
first of the Lancastrian Kings.

His second Wise was Constance, eldest Daughter of Peter King of Castile and
Leon, in whose Right he bore the same Title, and had by her

Catharine, whose Posterity became Kings of Spain in her Right.

His third Wife was Catharine, Widow of Sir Hugh Swinford, an English Knight,
eldest Daughter and Co heir of Pain Red (Guien King at Arms); her younger
Sifter married Sir Jeoffry Chaucer, the English Laureat. He had by her, before
Marriage, several Children, surnamed De Beaufort, from a Castle of his in
France of that Name, where they were born: In regard of which, they gave a
Portcullis for their Cognizance, and were all of them legitimated in
Parliament, 1397. with this Clause nevertheless, Excepting the Reg Dignity. As,
1. John, first Knighted, and afterward created Earl of Somerset, 1398. 2.
Henry, afterward Bishop of Winchester, Cardinal of St. Eusebius, and
Chancellor of England. 3. Thomas, first created Earl of Dorset, 1398. and
afterward Duke of Exeter, 1414. 4. And one Daughter Joan; first married to
Ralph Nevil Baron of Wemm; created afterward the first Earl of West m^rland:
And after him, to Robert Ferrers Lord of Owseley.


5. Edmond of Langley; born 1342. created Earl of Cambridge, 1362. Duke of
York, 1386. He was the first that gave the White Rose; and died 1402. His Wife
was Isabella, youngest Daughter of the said Peter King of Castile; by whom he
had

Richard Plantagenet, Earl of Cambridge; married to Anne Mortimer, Daughter of
Roger Earl of March; by whom he had

Richard Duke of York, slain at the Battle of Wakefield, 1460. Father of, 1.
Edward, Duke of York, who recovered the Crown from King Henry VI. 2. George
Duke of Clarence. 3. Richard Duke of Gloucester, afterward King.


6. William of Windsor, who died young.

7. Thomas of Woodstock; a Man valiant and wise. He was created Earl of
Buckingham, 1376. then Duke of Gloucester, by Richard II. and at last
treacherously made away (some say strangled) at Callice, 1397.

XII. Richard II. born at Bourdeaux, 1367. succeeded his Grandfather, and was
Crowned July 16. 1377. in the 11th Year of his Age. The Care of him was first
committed to certain Bishops and Earls, and lastly to Thomas Beauchamp Earl of
Warwick, 1379. In the Year 1382. John Ball, a Priest, and Disciple of
Wickliffe, with one Watt Tyler a Tailor, and others, work the Common People
into a Rebellion; murder Simon de Sudbury Archbishop of Canterbury, and several
of the Nobility; and with a numerous Rabble come at last to Smithfield by
Landon, where Sir William VVallw^rth. then Lord Mayor, upon some rude Language
given the King by the said Tyler, stabbed him dead, and therewith dispersed the
Rabble: In memory of which, the King gave the City the Augmentation of a Bloody
Dagger to their Co^^n the Year 1366. Henry (...) of Derby, Son of John of
Gaunt, was created Duke of Hereferd; and being accused by (...) M^ubrey Duke of
Norfolk, of some dangerous Words by him (...), demanded a Trial by Battle,
which was accepted; and both being in the Lists ready in combat, Hereford was
ban^th'd for ten Years (of which the King struck often four) and went (...)
France: And the Year following Johne Gaunt died. In 1399, the King went into
Ireland; and in his absence, Thomas Arundel Archbishop of Canterbury, and
others, contrive to depose him, and set up Henry, now Duke of Lancaster; who
upon their Invitation, returned, and met the King in Wales, from whence he was
conveyed to the Tower of London; where a Parliament being in the mean time
called in King Richard's Name, the King resigned his Crown to the said Henry,
and made the Bishops of York and Hereford his Procurators, to declare his
Resignation to the Parliament; which was accepted: And (to color the matter)
Articles were preser^ed against him, on which he was deposed, September. 9. 1399.
and afterward trait (...) murdered in Pomfret Castle, 1401. by Sir Pierce
Exten, and eight others (as he was at D^^^er) of whom yet he slew four; in the
Thirty third Year of his Age, and Twenty sec^nd of his Reign. His first Wife
was Anne, Daughter of Charles IV. Emperor. His second, Isabel, Daughter of
Charles VI. King of France; but had no Issue by either of them.

XIII.. VI. Upon this Deposition, Henry ^^^ke of Lancaster, eldest Son of John
of Gaunt, tourth Son of Edward III. Born 1368. was Crowned King Octch. 13.
1399. by the Name of King Henry IV. albeit Edmond Mortimer Earl of March, Son
of Roger Mortimer Earl of March, Son and Heir of Philippa, Daughter and Heir of
^iond, third Son of King Edward III. was then living: and the said Earl R^ger
his Father, upon King Richard's going into Ireland, in the Year 1385. had been
declared in Parliament Heir Apparent to the Crown, if the said Richard died
without Issue. This occasioned those bloody Wars between the Houses of York and
Lancaster, in which there were Twelve pitched Battles fought between them, in
the compass of Thirty six Years. The beginning of his Reign was sull of
Troubles; for Thomas Merks Bishop of Carlisle, made a Speech in Parliament in
favor of Richard the deposed King; for which, albeit he was imprisoned, yet it
so stuck with the Nobility, that six of the Chief of them combine to seize King
Henry, and restore King Richard; and to that purpose, undertook a solemn
Justing to he held at Oxford, in the Chrismas 1401. and invited the King to it;
which he accepted. but the Plot being accidentally discovered by one of the
Conspirators, it was seasonably prevented and crushed. Nor was it long are Owen
Glendour rose in Wales, 1400. and declared for Edmond Mortimer. The like did
the Earls of Northumberland and Worcester in the North; who before they could
join Forces, were beaten by the exemplary Courage of Prince Henry his Son,
1403. The King at last having wrought through every thing that opposed him,
died of an Apoplexy, March 20. 1413. in the Forty sixth Year of his Age and
Fourteenth of his Reign. His first Wife was Mary, one of the Daughters and
Coheirs of Humphrey de Bohun Earl of Hereford, Essex, and Northampton; she
died before he came to the Crown, 1394. but left him four Sons: 1. Henry V. who
succeeded him. 2. Thomas Duke of Clarence, slain at Beaufort in France; but
left no Issue. 3. John Duke of Bedford, and Regent of France: Died September. 14.
1435. but had no Issue. 4. Humphrey, surnamed The Good, created Duke of
Gloucester by his Brother Henry V. Protector to his Nephew Henry VI. and at
last imprisoned and strangled by the device of Queen Margaret, Wife of the said
Henry VI. 1447.


His second Wife was Joan, Daughter of Charles I. King of Navarre, Widow of
John de Menth^^^ Duke of Bretagne; by whom he had no Issue She survived her
Husband, and died 1437.

XIV. To him succeeded his eldest Son Henry V. born at Monmouth, 1385. Crowned
April 9. 1412. His Youth had been somewhat extravagant; but he soon recovered
it, and supplied his defect of Title by worthy Actions. The Parliament at this
time looked with a sharp eye upon the Church Lands; and to divert the Humor,
Henry Chichely Archbishop of Canterbury, put the King in the head of his Title
to France; and withal assured him, That he had consulted the Clergy, and that
they had resolved to advance such a Sum toward it, as never Spiritual Persons
had given to any King before. Upon this, the King treated with the Parliament
touching the matter, which they so approved, that an Army is forthwith raised,
in the head of which he lands in France, and in a sew days besieged Harflue,
and took it, 1415. and having passed the River Soame, came up with the French,
then lying at Agincourt; where with an Army not exceeding 15000 Men, he cut off
the others of 60000, October. 25. the same Year; and returned for England 1416.
and made the Duke of Bedford Regent of France; 1417. whither he followed
himself the same Summer. Took Caen, 1417. Chierburgh, Dampfront, 1418. Rohan,
Vernon, Mante, Pontoise, the Castle of St. Germane, Meulane, 1419. And after
another Victory near the City of Men's, it was, amongst other things, concluded,
That King Henry should marry the Lady Catharine, the King of France's Daughter;
and after his death, become Heir of the said Realm; and in the mean time, have
the whole Government of the same as Regent thereof. According to which, they
were married June 3. 1420. and the King solemnly proclaimed Heir and Regent of
France; and the Duke of Burgundy, and most of the Nobility swore Fealty to him:
As also did the Three Estates of the Realm assembled at Paris, each Person
severally for himself, 1421. And in April following, carried his Queen into
England. Yet notwithstanding this, Charks the Dauphin retires to Berry, and
gets Forces together. Nor was the Duke of Bedford less industrious to pursue
him; 'till the King coming over again, and in his march to relieve Cosny, then
besieged by the Dauphin, was taken with a Pleurisy, of which he died at Blot
St. Vincent, Aug. 31. 1422. in the Thirty eighth Year of his Age, and Tenth of
his Reign; and left by the said Catharine de Valois, Daughter of the said King
of France,

XV. Henry VI. born at Windsor, December. 1421. and being not above nine Months
old at the death of his Father, was proclaimed King of England and France, Aug.
30. 1422. and committed to the Custody of Thomas Duke of Exeter, and Henry de
Beaufort Bishop of Winchester, his Uncles; John Duke of B^dford, and Humphrey
Duke of Gloucester, having been appointed the former Regent of France, the
other Protector of England. And now Charles VI. of France being also dead, the
Dauphin his Son cansed himself to be proclaimed King, by the Name of Charles
VII. On which, many of the French Nohility revoked to him. Nor was the Regent
idle during this time, but took several Places of Strength from him; gave him a
defeat at Cravant in Bu^goigne, 1423, recovered Campeigne and Cr^t^te; beat him
a second time at the Battle of Vernoile, 1424. and followed it with success,
'till Montacute Earl of Salisbury being slain by a Great-shot in the Castle of
Orleans, 1428. the Fortune of the English began to be at a stand: For at this
Siege it was that the Maid of Orleans (or Jean d'Arcque) was brought to the
said Charles, as a Person inspired by God for the delivery of her Country; and
that Miracles might be expected from her Conduct. However it were, it so
wrought on the Superstition of the People, that she may be said to have turned
again the Fate of France: And Charles VII took that heart upon it, that he
forthwith came before Rheims, which was yielded to him, and himself Crowned
there, 1428. The Year following King Henry went over in Person, and was Crowned
in Paris, December. 17. 1431. and after a Year's stay there, returned for
England. Not long after, viz: September. 14. 1435. the Duke of Bedford died, and
Richard Duke of York was made Regent: but removed 1439. and the Earl of Warwick
substituted in his room. Upon whose death, the Duke of York was again made
Regent, 1441. And upon a Treaty of Peace between the two Kings, 1444. William
de la P^^l Earl of Suffolk, and others, are appointed Commissioners for the
King of England: But finding nothing like to come of it, he proposes a Match
between the King, and Margaret, Daughter of Reiner Duke of Anjou, Titular King
of Sicily, Naples, and Jerusalem; which, however opposed by the Duke of
Gloucester, Protector of the Realm, took that effect, that they were married,
May 18. 1445. And the Duke of York again removed; and the Queen, and Suff^lk
(by this time made Duke) prevail upon the King's Mildness, and govern all
things at their pleasure. This and the like so disgusted the Duke of York, that
he began to tamper about his Title to the Crown, to which the death of the
Cardinal of Winchester, 1448. the Exorbitances of Suffolk, and the Duke of
Gloucester's (the main Prop of the House of Lancaster) having been discharged
from the Protectorship, imprisoned, and sound dead in his Bed, the Year before,
gave no small encouragement. All which being turned upon Suffolk, he is
erclaim'd at by the Commons, impeached by the Lords, and thereupon fled for
France; but taken in his way, had his Head struck off against the side of a
Cock boat, 1450. To him succeeded in equal Favor of the Queen, and Hatred of
the People, Edmond Duke of Somerset: And therefore York, having gotten to his
Party the two Nevils (Father and Son) the one Earl of Salisbury, the other of
Warwick, he raised Forces under pretext of removing diverse Counselors from
about the King, and after several Transactions forward and backward, worsted
the King at the Battle of St. Albany May 23. 1455. where the Duke of Somerset
was slain, the King taken Prisoner, a Parliament called, the Duke of York
declared Protector of the Realm, and the Earl of Warwick Captain of Callice.
All which was again overturned, by the Queen and her Party, the Year following;
and the Duke of York and his Friends (having gotten into Ireland) were
attainted in Parliament, 1459. Notwithstanding which, they return again; and
being headed by Edward Earl of March, fight the King at Northampton, and take
him Prisoner, July 9. 1460. On this, the Duke of York, Father of the said
Edward, entered the House of Lords (the Parliament then sitting) seated himself
in the Throne, To whom (said he) it of right belongs. The Parliament on this
openly declared for his Title; but in regard Henry had been taken as King for
Thirty eight Years, it was condescended, That he should hold the Title and Name
of King, and have the Possession of the Realm during his natural Life; but if
he either died, resigned, or forfeited the same, by breaking or going against
any Point of that Accord; that then the said Crown and Regal Authority, should
be immediately devolved, and come to the Duke of York, if he were then living:
Or in case he died, to the next Heir of his Lineage: And that the Duke of York
should from thenceforth be Protector and Regent of the Land. All which being
sworn to by both Parties, and enacted in Parliament, November. 1. 1461. Richard
Duke of York, on the Saturday next ensuing, was proclaimed Heir Apparent to the
Crown, and Protector of the Realm. During this time, the Queen (a Lady of a
Courage beyond her Sex) had raised an Army to rescue the King, met the
Protector at Wakefield the Christmas following, where he was routed and slain,
and King Henry gotten into her hands again. The Earl of March on the other hand
(now Duke of York by the death of his Father) lay with Forces in
Gloucestershire; and upon hearing of this Defeat, made to the Queen, and
worsted her; first at Mortimer's Cross near Hereford, the Candlemas-day after;
and on the 17th of the same Month, gave her a total defeat near St. Alban's: In
which yet the most remarkable Man slain was Sir John Gray. On which, King
Henry, with the Queen and Prince Edward their Son, got into the North; and the
Duke of York was proclaimed King in the head of the Army. After which, King
Henry lived somewhat more than Ten Years; but generally unfortunate, as shall
be shown in the next Paragraph, and at last died in the Tower, some say of
Grief, or as others, murdered by Richard Duke of Gloucester, May 23. 1471. in
the Fifty second Year of his Age, having reigned of that Thirty eight Years.
His Wife was Margaret, Daughter of Reiner Duke of Anjou, etc. of whom before;
by whom he had

Edward, Prince of Wales, born at Westminster, October. 13. 1453. taken at the
Battle of Teuxbury (of which in the next Paragraph) May 4. 1471. and the same
day killed in cold Blood, by George Duke of Clarence, and the said Duke of
Gloucester.

XVI. And now Edward IV. having taken upon him the Covernment, he was (as well
by Right of Inheritance, as the Accord before mentioned) proclaim^d King
throughout London, March 4. 1401. Nor was he searce warm in his Seat, ere the
comoved King Henry returned out of the North with a mighty Force; but was
overthrown by King Edward at Tow ton Field, March 29. 1462. However, himself
escaped into Scotland, and sent the Queen and Prince to her Father in France;
and King Edward on the other hand Crowned, June 29. following. Nor was Queen
Margaret all this while idle, but returned with new Forces into the North,
where she joined those Succors her Husband had brought out of Scotland; and
with the Assistance of their Friends at home, out it to another Battle at Exham
Field, May 4. 1463. where King Henry was taken, and the Queen made her escape
into France to her Father. And now King Edward being in a manner settled, he
sent the Earl of Warwick into France, to demand the Lady Bona, Daughter to
Lewis Duke of Savoy, and Sister to Charlotte then Queen of France, for Wife;
which was so well relished, that it was in a short time assented to. But it so
happened, that the Lady Elizabeth Gray, Widow of Sir John Gray, slain at the
last Battle of St. Alban's, coming to petition for her Jointure, which had been
seized into the King's hands; the King not only granted it, but became a
Petitioner himself: And being not able to obtain it otherwise, married her
1465. This bred no good Blood in France, and netled Warwick, who took no notice
of it for the present; but (with the King's leave) retired to Warwick. However,
to prevent the worst, the King made his Brother, George Nevil, Archbishop of
York, 1467, and to secure a Friend against France, married his Sister Margaret,
to Charles Duke of Burgundy, 1468. By this time, the Earl of Warwick (still
meditating a Revenge) had wrought over to his Design the said Archbishop, and
his other Brother, John Marquess Montacute; and leaving them behind him to make
some Commotion in his absence, took the Duke of Clarence with him, and went
over to his Command at Callice: And upon full assurance that the said Duke bore
no great Good Will to the King his Brother, for a Tie of Friendship between
them, married the Lady Isabel, his elder. Daughter, to him. The Commotion was
ascordingly made, and in a short time impror'd to such a Rebellion, that the
King was forced to raise an Army to suppress it: But VVarwul who had privately
gotten over, and now headed it, by the assistance of Clarence, fell upon the
King in the Night, and brought him Prisoner to VVarwick-Castle, whence he made
as escape; and having gotten to London, so ordered his Affairs, that Clarence
and VVarwid were forced for France again, where they are kindly received,
especially by Queen Margaret, who to secure the Earl to her side, married he
Son the Prince, to Anne, second Daughter o^ the said Earl; and took an Oath of
him, and such of the Nobility as followed her Fortune not to leave the War,
'till either King Henry or his Son the Prince, were restored to the Crown. On
which he came over for E^^land, and forced King Edward into Holland. Where he
stayed not long, but returned, and drove Warwick back to Callice, April 1470.
Where having made his Recruits, he came over the August following; and the
Country so fell in with him, that King Edward, finding himself not able to
withstand the Force, passed the Sea to his Brother-in-Law the Duke of Burgundy,
and left his Queen in the Sanctuary at VVestrninster, where she was delivered
of her eldest Son Prince Edward. Warwick in the mean time making for London,
delivered King Henry out of the Tower, and restored him to his Kingly
Government, himself neverthelass being made Lieutenant of the Realm; and
Clarence (who unknown to the Earl had made his Peace with King Edward his
Brother) loyn'd as Associate with him. The Duke of Burgundy in the mean time,
though he publicly refused to appear for King Edward; yet underhand gave him
that Supply from others, that he landed again in England, March 12. 1471. where
he found his Friends ready to receive him, and the Earl of Warwick (though
Clarence began to draw off, and Queen Margaret not yet come with her Succors
from France) as forward to oppose him. Notwithstanding which, King Edward got
to London, and had King Henry delivered to him by the Archbishop of York, to
whose Care the Earl of Warwick (his Brother) had entrusted him. This done, King
Edward advanced toward St. Alban's, where Warwick lay, and met him at
Barnet-Heath; where after a desperate Engagement, the said Earl, and his other
Brother, the Marquess Montacute, were slain, April 14. 1471. King Edward went
back to London, and offered his Standard at St. Paul's; nor was the Ceremony
scarce over, before news was brought him, That Queen Margaret was landed at
Weymouth, with a mighty Power. On which, the King marched against her with what
expedition he could, and met her at Teuxbury, May 4. following; and after a
bloody Fight, gave her a total Rout, and took the Prince her Son Prisoner, whom
the Dukes of Clarence and Gloucester (afterward King Richard III.) slew in the
King's presence. Not long after which, the said Queen being found in a poor
House of Religion, was brought a Prisoner to London, and so kept, 'till
ransomed by her Father: And to complete the Tragedy, King Henry (now Prisoner
in the Tower) underwent the same Fate with his Son, and by the same hand, the
23d. of the same Month and Year, having reigned but six Months after his
recovery of the Crown. Upon which, Jasper Earl of Pembroke, taking his young
Nephew Henry Earl of Richmond (afterward King Henry VII) with him made his
escape to the Duke of Bretagne, and was well received by him; nor could King
Edward with all his Artifices ever get him out of his hands. And now all things
quieted a home, the King went for Callice, 1474. to divert the King of France's
Attempts upon Burgundy; but the Duke failing to join him according to promise,
he made a Peace with the King of France for nine Years, which was sworn to by
both Kings, upon an Interview between them near Amiens, 1475. and returned to
England. After which, George Duke of Clarence upon some old Disgusts between
the King and him, was sent to the Tower, 1476. adjudg'd a Traitor, and not long
after found dead in a Butt of Malmsie, 1477. Leaving Issue by the said Earl of
VVarwick's Daughter Anne, 1. Edward, created Earl of Warwick by the said King
Edward, and beheaded by Henry VII. 1500. 2. Margaret, Countess of Salisbury
(Mother of Cardinal Pool) beheaded by Henry VIII 1541. In which two died the
Right Line and Surname of Plantagenet.


In the Year 1482. James III. King of Scotand, having broken some Articles
between King Edward and him, the King sent an Army into Scotland, under the
Command of the Duke of Gloucester; took Berwick, and brought that King to his
Terms. But while he was preparing for a War with France, fell sick, and died
April 9. 1483. in the Forty first Year of his Age, and Twenty third of his
Reign. He had to Wife the Lady Elizabeth Gray beforementioned, who brought him
five Daughters and two Sons: 1. Elizabeth of York, born Feb. 11. 1466. designed
Wife to George Nevil Duke of Bedford; promised afterward to the Dauphin,
courted by her Uncle King Richard III. but at last married to King Henry VII.
2. Cecilia, to the Viscount Wells; and after his decease, to -- Kyme of
Lincolnshire. 3. Anne, to Thomas Lord Howard, afterward Earl of Surrey, and
Duke of Norfolk. 4. Bridget, born November. 10. 1480. professed in the Nunnery of
Dartford. 5. Mary, promised in Marriage to the King of Denmark, but died before
its Consummation. 6. Margaret, born April 19. 1472. died in her Infancy. 7.
Catharine, married to the Lord William Courtney, Son to the Earl of Devonshire.


His Sons: 1. Edward, Prince of Wales; born Nov. 4. 1470. 2. Richard, Duke of
York and Norfolk, Earl of Nottingham and Warren; both murdered by the
procurement of the Duke of Gloucester their Uncle, 1483. 3. George, Duke of
Bedford, died an Infant.


His Natural Issue: Arthur (to whom he gave the Name of Plantagenet) created
Viscount Lisle, by King Henry VIII. 1523. and died 1542. As also one Daughter,
Elizabeth Plantagenet, married to the Lord Lumley.


XVII. Edward V. succeeded his Father in Title, though not in the Crown; for
being not above Thirteen Years of Age at the death of his Father, Sir Anthony
VVoodvile, Lord Rivers, his Mother's Brother, was appointed Governor to him,
and (with Richard Gray Marquess of Dorset, his Half-brother by the Mother) sent
to conduct him from Ludlow (where he then was) to London: And on this, the Duke
of Gloucester his Uncle, lays the Foundation of his designed Usurpation; and in
order to it, there having been some secret Grudge between Edward Duke of
Buckingham his Creature, and William Lord Hastings, then Lord Chamberlain,
both Enemies of the Queen's; he first reconciles them, and then rells them how
unreasonable it was that the young King their Master, should be in the hands of
his Mother's Kindred (a new Nobility) a thing neither Honorable to his Majesty,
nor them. Whereupon it is agreed, That they be removed, as Enemies. On this,
Gloucester and Buckingham meet the King (with all Obedience) at Stony
Stratford, and having secured the Lord Rivers and Dorset (whom they shortly
after beheaded at Powfret) bring him to London, May 4. 1483. the Queen (upon
hearing what had passed) having, with her younger Son and Daughters, taken
sanctuary at Westminster. On which, the Duke of Gloucester is made Protector of
the Realm. The next device was how to get the young Duke out of his Mother's
hands, which she (as suspecting the design) will by no means consent to.
However, at last, what with the Assurance of several of the Privy Council for
his safety, and Threats of forcing the Sanctuary for him, he is delivered to
the Protector; who with all seeming joy, brings him to the King his Brother,
into the Bishop of London's Palace at St. Paul's; and thence honorably through
the City (for the King's security, as was given out) until his Coronation. The
Protector all along had made his residence near the Tower; and having so
tangled Buckingham that he could not safely get off, he comes to the point with
him; on which it is agreed between them, That the Protector should have the
Duke's aid to make him King; and that the Protector's Son should marry the
Duke's Daughter, with a Grant to himself of the Earldom of Hereford, which he
claimed as his Inheritance; but could never obtain it in King Edward's time.
Whereupon, Buckingham undertakes for the City, with whom he was not the least
popular. The King now having his Court in the Tower, the Council meet there for
ordering the Solemnity of his Coronation; which was carried on with such
forwardness, and the Day appointed for it so near at hand, that all Mistrust
was (visibly) set aside; 'till the Protector (having pumped the Lord
Chamberlain by his Friend Catesby, and finding no good to be done on him) came
into the Council, June 13. and knitting his Brows, arrested him as a Traitor;
for that he, with his Brother's Wife the Queen, had attempted his Life by
Sorcery. And therewith giving a knock, a Guard came in, who by the Protector's
Command, forthwith carried him out, and struck off his Head; and severally
secured the rest of the Council. Whereupon, sending for some of the Chief of
the City, he made them a fair Tale, How himself and the Duke of Buckingham were
to have been destroyed in Council, by a Conspiracy of the Lord Chamberlain's:
And returns them with an Herald, and a Proclamation in the King's Name to
satisfy the People. There was at that time one Sir Edmond Shaw, Lord Mayor of
London, who (upon promise of advancement) had been made to their Party; as also
one Doctor John Shaw, Brother to the Mayor, and Doctor John Penker, Provincial
of the Augustine Friars; both noted Preachers, but of more Fame, than either
Virtue or Learning: And these are the Men must make that Gospel to the People,
which Catesby had undertaken for Law to the Kingdom. And having received their
Instructions accordingly, Shaw begins at St. Paul's Cross the Sunday after,
where upon that Text ( Spuria Vitulamina, etc) The Bastard-Slips shall not take
root; he signified to the People, That not only King Edward IV. and his Brother
George Duke of Clarence, were not the very Sons of Richard Duke of York, but
begotten in Adultery on the Duchess their Mother: But that the now King
Edward, and his Brother Richard Duke of York, were both Bastards, inasmuch as
their Father King Edward IV. at the time that he married the Lady Elizabeth
Gray their Mother, was precontracted to the Lady Elizabeth Lucy, who was his
lawful Wife before God. Then turning his Discourse to the Protector and his
Title, rendered him the express Image of the Noble Duke his Father, and the
very Right Heir of his Body begotten. Yet all this took so little with the
People, that Penker was reserved 'till after the Coronation; at which time he
so lost his Voice, that he was forced to come down in the midst of his Sermon.
The Tuesday following, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commoners being assembled in
the Guild Hall, the Duke of Buckingham came among them; and having raked
together whatever could be thought of against King Edward IV. and his
Government, he recapitulated Shaw's Sermon, magnified the Protector and his
Title, to them; and concluded from the whole ( Vae Regno, etc.) Woe to that
Realm that has a Child to its King. Neither had this also any effect upon
them, 'till a packed Company at the other end of the Hall, throwing up their
Bonnets, and crying King Richard! King Richard! the Mayor took it by the end,
and said it was so goodly and joyful to hear so full a Cry, and no one
gainsaying it, that he would represent it to the Protector the next Morning;
which (accompanied with all the Aldermen and Chief Commoners of the City in
their Formalities, and conducted by the Duke of Buckingham) he accordingly did:
And the Protector (Good Man) so utterly refused, that they began to be afraid
he was in earnest; 'till at last Good Nature prevailed, and he inclined to
their Petition, and took upon him the Kingship, June 22. 1483. which is the sum
of the three Months and nineteen Days Reign of King Edward V. He was never
Crowned, nor married; but (together with his Brother Richard Duke of York)
murdered in the Tower, in a short time after.

XVIII. After this Mock-Election, Richard III. now no longer Protector, was
Crowned King, July 6. following, with the self-same Provision that was
appointed for the Coronation of his Nephew; with this addition only, That his
Queen was Crowned with him. And now the first thing he did was to commit Morton
Bishop of Ely (who had been secured in the Tower) to the Custody of the Duke of
Buckingham, who sent him to a House of his at Brecknock in Wales, whence he
afterward escaped, to the destruction of King Richard. That done, the King
made a progress to Gloucester, and sent one John Green (whom he 'specially
trusted) with a Letter of Credence to Sir Robert Brakenbury, Constable of the
Tower; the effect of which was, to put the young Princes to death; which he
absolutely refused, though (said he) he were to die therefore. On this, he sent
another Letter by Sir James Tyrrel, with a Command to Brakenbury, to deliver
him the Keys of the Tower for one Night; which was accordingly done, and the
Princes murdered by one Miles Forest, a Fellow fleshed in Blood before that
time, and John Dighton, his own Groom. The Duke of Buckingham had accompanied
the King in his Progress; but whether it were that the King had been remiss to
him in his Promise touching the Earldom of Hereford, or that the Duke looked
a-skew on the Crown he had procured him, the Duke left him at Gloucester; but
not without large Assurances from the King, who doubted nothing less but that
he was pleased: And so with a merry Countenance, and a disgusted Heart, the
Duke went off to his Charge at Brecknock. The Bishop had been a firm Adherer to
the House of Loncaster; and the Duke had lost his Father and Grandfather in
their Quarrel. This, and the but just Reputation of the Bishop's Experience,
begat a Familiarity between them; which after several broken Discourses off and
on, came at last to this, That they took an Oath of Secrecy to each other; and
the PRESENT USURPATION and Tyranny was the Single Argument. The Duke ran over
the King's Breach of Faith with him, and particularly charges him with the
Murder of his Nephews, which he had sworn to him never to attempt. Nor was the
Bishop wanting to give the Flame vent; and as Occasion offered, to add fresh
Fuel to the Fire. On which, it was at last resolved between them, That the
Tyrant be removed: And for the manner of doing it, the Bishop (having got
within him) proposes to him his own Title, as Grandchild by the Mother, to
Edmond Duke of Somerset, lineally descended from John of Gaunt; and so next
Heir to King Henry VI. Which the Duke answered, by saying, He once thought so,
and had resolved on it; 'till having better considered, he remembered, That
Edmond his Grandfather had an elder Brother, John Duke of Somerset, whose
Daughter the Lady Margaret, Countess of Richmond, is sole Heir to him; and
therefore, to marry her Son Henry Earl of Richmond, to the Lady Elizabeth,
eldst Daughter of King Edward IV. and there by unite the two Houses of York and
Lancaster, were the only Expedient to settle the Kingdom. The Bishop now was
where he would be; and therefore for fear the matter should cool, proposes a
sober Gentleman, one Reginald Gray, (a Servant of the Countess's, not unknown
to the Duke) who should communicate the Affair to such Persons as the Duke
should direct. Which being approved of, Gray is forthwith sent for, and
dispatched to the Countess; who liked it so well, that she sent one Lewis her
Physician to acquaint the Queen with it; who returned him to the Countess with
this Answer, That if her Son Henry would take a corporal Oath to marry her
Daughter Elizabeth, that all the Friends and Favorers of King Edward her
Husband, should assist and take part with him. Which being agreed to by the
Countess, she sent Christopher Urswick her Chaplain to her Son, in Bretagne;
and by another way, Moneys, and particular Instructions that he should land in
Wales. Matters thus disposed, and Answers returned, the Duke and the Bishop
engage several of the Nobility and Gentry in an Oath of Secrecy, and every of
them prepare Forces to meet the Earl of Richmond, and join him: Yet things were
not so closely carried, but that King Richard got an inkling of it; and
therefore plied the Duke of Bretagne (to whom the Earl of Richmond had opened
his Design) to deliver the said Earl into his hands: Which he not only refused,
but, on the contrary, assisted him with Men and Moneys. During which, the
Bishop took the opportunity of making an escape into Flanders; which fretted
the Duke; and that the more, in regard the King (knowing the Duke to be in the
head of the Business) wrote him a kind Letter, thereby inviting him to Court;
which he excused with pretense of Sickness. Whereupon the King sent him a
peremptory Command; which he as determinately answered by word of mouth, That
he would not come to his mortal Enemy; and sent immediately to his Friends to
take Arms with him; which they accordingly did: But before they could join him,
the Duke's Forces were dispersed, and every Man shifted for himself as he best
might: Most of the Chief of which got into Bretagne, and the Duke to the House
of one Banister (beside Shrewsbury) whom he had bred from his Youth, and loved
and trusted above all Men; yet for the hopes of 1000 l. which was set upon the
Duke's Head, he was betrayed by him, and brought to Shrewsbury, where he was
beheaded without Trial, November. 1. the same Year. And the Earl of Richmond, and
such as had gotten over to him, were attainted in Parliament, 1484. Nor was the
Earl idle all this time, but applied himself to Charles VIII. King of France,
who liberally assisted him suitable to the Expedition. And so the Earl having
given the English Nobility his Oath, That forthwith after his being possessed
of the Crown of England, he would take to Wife the Lady Elizabeth, as
aforesaid, they swore him Fealty, and did him Homage, and made ready to set
forward for England: And being informed, That Richard had gotten the Daughters
of Edward IV. into his hand, with the Consent of the Queen their Mother, and
made away his Wife, to the intent of marrying the said Lady Elizabeth, he made
the more haste; and with the Earl of Pembroke, and the rest, put to Sea, and
landed at Milford Haven the August following; and thence removed to Hereford,
where the Country came in to him; and a Message from the Town of Pembroke, That
they were ready to give their attendance on the Earl their Lord. By which
means, and several of King Richard's Party falling in with him, his Army grew
stronger daily; and the Lord Stanly (who had married the Countess of Richmond,
Mother to Henry) lay hovering with an Army of five thousand Men; but durst not
declare for him, for fear of the Lord Strange his Son, whom King Richard kept
as an Hostage for his Father's not acting against him. Yet was not Richard so
amazed at it, but that he met his Enemy with a powerful Army at Bosworth near
Leicester, where, in the heat of the Battle, the Lord Stanly joined Earl Henry
with his fresh Forces, as also did Sir William Stanly his Brother with three
thousand more, and slew King Richard, Aug. 22. 1485. whose Crown (found among
the Spoil) he forthwith put on the Head of the said Earl; on which, he was
proclaimed King by the Army. Thus fell that Usurper Richard, in the Thirty
seventh Year of his Age, and Third of his Reign. His Wife was Anne, youngest
Daughter of Richard Earl of Warwick; by whom he had

Edward, Prince of Wales, Earl of Chester and Salisbury; born in his Uncle King
Edward IV.'s Reign, An. 1473. (of whom before.)

As also a Natural Daughter; viz.

Catharine Plantagenet. But neither of them survived him.

XIX.. VII. King Henry VII. (Son of Edmond Teuther Earl of Richmond, by the
Lady Margaret, Daughter and Heir of John Duke of Somerset, lineally descended
from John de Beaufort beforementioned) having thus gotten the Victory at
Bosworth, the first thing he did was to secure Edward Plantagenet Earl of
Warwick (about Fifteen Years of Age) Son of George Duke of Clarence (of whom
also before) kept Prisoner in Yorkshire by King Richard III. together with the
Lady Elizabeth; the former of which he sent to the Tower, the other to her
Mother in London, whither he followed by slow Journies; and was Crowned, October.
30. the same Year: And having called a Parliament, in which the Inheritance of
the Crown of this Realm and France, was entailed on him and the Heirs of his
Body, he married the said Lady Elizabeth, Jan. 18. following. In 1486. he
called another Parliament, in which it was enacted, That the Queen Dowager
Elizabeth should forfeit all her Lands and Possessions because she had
voluntarily submitted her sell and her Daughters to Richard III. contrary to
her Promise to the Lords, etc. On which, she retired to a Nunnery at
Bermondsey, where she died not many Years after. And now such as favored the
House of York, set a Project on foot to lay by King Henry, and advance the
aforesaid Edward Earl of Warwick to the Crown. To which purpose, one Richard
Simond, a crafty Priest of Oxford, having a sharp Pupil (called Lambert
Simnell) and not unlike the said Earl, either for Stature or Years: He is
pitched upon to personate him, and take his Name, who (as was given out) had
got out of the Tower. Nor was it long ere he was so well instructed in the Mien
of a Prince, and the Lineage he was to pretend to, that they adventured for
Ireland; where he was received as the undoubted Heir of the House of York,
which the Irish rather favored than that of Lancaster. Upon advice of this,
the Earl of Lincoln (Son of John de la Pool Duke of Suffolk, by Elizabeth,
Sister to King Edward IV.) and others, his Friends; not thinking it meet to
neglect so fair an Opportunity, got over into Flanders, to the Lady Margaret,
Duchess Dowager of Burgundy (one other Sister of the said King Edward) where
they met the Lord Lovel, who had escaped from Bosworth; and at last concluded
among them, That Lincoln and Lovel should go into Ireland, and there attend
upon Lambert, and honor him as King; and taking with him two thousand Men,
should, with the Power of the Irish Men, bring him into England; in which if
they succeeded, Lambert should be laid by, and the true Earl of Warwick be
delivered out of Prison, and Crowned King. King Henry, on the other hand, made
no more of it, than to expose the Earl of Warwick to a public view through the
City; 'till hearing that the Earl of Lincoln was arrived in Ireland, and had
Crowned Lambert at Dublin, with a resolution of coming for England, he gathered
a great Army against him, who by that time was landed near Lancaster, and came
forward to Stoke, where the King's Forces met him; and after a hard-fought
Battle, and total Overthrow to Lambert, he and his Tutor were taken Prisoners,
June 16. 1487. and being brought to London, Lambert was made a Turn-spit in the
King's Kitchen, and the other (as being a Priest) committed to perpetual
Imprisonment. There were also other Insurrections the same Year, which the King
dispersed by his Proclamation of Pardon, ere it came to the Sword. And having
made a Truce with Scotland for seven Years, Crowned his Queen, November. 25.
following. About this time the King of France making War upon the Duke of
Bretagne, King Henry mediates between them: But to no effect; for upon the
death of the said Duke, 1488. the King of France overran the Duchy,
incorporated it to the Crown of France, and in 1489. married the Duchess. King
Henry liked not this new Accession, and therefore (since nothing else could
prevail) made War upon France, 1490. The Duchess of Burgundy laid hold of the
Occasion, and brings upon the Stage one Peter, or Perkin Warbeck, to take on
him the Name and Person of Richard Duke of York, second Son of King Edward IV.
her Brother, not murdered in the Tower (as she gave it abroad) but escaped into
Ireland, whither she had (underhand) sent him. In which he acted his Part so
well, that he was taken for what he personated, 1491. The French King being
advertised thereof, sent for him out of Ireland, to the intent to arm him
against King Henry, who was then invading France; gave him a Royal Reception,
and assigned him a Guard. On which, several of the English got over to him: But
it so happening that the two Kings were made Friends, Perkin was dismissed, and
(with his Followers) went to the Duchess of Burgundy, who joyfully welcomed
him; yet seeming as if she had never seen him, solemnly examined him, Of his
escape from being murdered; In what Countries he had wandered; By what means he
had found Friends; and, What Chance of Fortune had brought him to her Court. To
all which he made such direct Answers, that she assigned him a Princely Guard,
and called him The White Rose of England, 1492. And to the end the truth of the
matter might be the better known, Sir Robert Clifford, and one William Barely,
are by the common Consent of such as favored the House of York, sent over to
the Duchess to declare their Intentions concerning him: Which when she had
heard, she brought them to Perkin; who so well humored the thing, that Sir
Robert wrote back to them; and to put them out of doubt, affirmed, That he knew
him to be Richard Duke of York, King Edward's Son, by his Face, Gesture, and
other Lineaments of his Body. King Henry during this time was not ^sleep, but
sent over several Spies, under the ^otion of Fugitives; by which means, he got
into Perkin's Councils, and came to the knowledge of his Confederates; of whom,
some took sanctuary, others were put to death, 1493, and amongst them, the said
Sir William Stanly (whom he had made Lord High Chamberlain) and that only for
saying, If he knew the Young Man was the Son of King Edward IV. he would not
draw his Sword against him. Of which being convicted, he was beheaded Feb. 16.
1494. However, Perkin deeming he had Force enough yet left, put to Sea, and
attempted to land in Kent; but being repulsed, made back to Flanders, and
thence into Ireland; which answering not his Expectation, he sailed for
Scotland; where he made his Tale so well, that James IV. at that time King, not
only owned him as Duke of York, but married him to the Lady Catharine Gourdon,
Daughter of Alexander Earl of Huntley, his near Kinsman, 1495. and the Year
following, invaded England with Fire and Sword, and, in a manner, wasted
Northumberland. On which, Perkin beseeching him to spare his Subjects, the King
disgustingly bade him first see if they were his Subjects, or not; and finding
few or none come in to him, returned for Scotland. King Henry (on this)
resolving a Revenge on Scotland, the Parliament granted him a Subsidy of 120000
l. against the Payment of which, Cornwall rebels; and under the Conduct of one
Flammock a Lawyer, came into Somersetshire, where they were headed by the Lord
Audley, 1496. The King of Scots lays hold on the Occasion; and invading England
again, besieges Norham Castle, which Fox Bishop of Durham (Lord thereof had
fortified: But being not able to take it suddenly, and hearing the Earl of
Surrey was on his march near him, returned for Scotland, and was followed by
the Earl; when by the Mediation of the Ambassador of Spain, Commissioners
(whereof the said Bishop was one) are appointed to treat between both Kings, at
Jedard in Sctoland; which ended in a Truce: With this Condition nevertheless,
That though the King of Scots could not be persuaded to deliver up Perkin, that
yet he should discharge him his Protection and Dominions; which was accorded,
and accordingly done, 1497. The Cornish men in this time had gotten within four
Miles of London, where, after a great Slaughter, their Leaders were taken, and
executed: Yet were not the Rabble so absolutely cut off, but that (upon their
coming home) hearing Perkin was gotten into Ireland, they sent to him to come
and head them; which he slack'd not to do; and being proclaimed King by the
Name of Richard IV. laid siege to Exeter; but hearing the King was marching
against him, sent his Wife to the Mount in Cornwall, whence she was taken and
delivered to the King, and flying away by night himself, took sanctuary at
Beaudly in Hampshire; but finding no possibility of escaping, and withal
tempted with the promise of pardon, he voluntarily submitted himself to (...)
King's Pleasure; who set him in the Stocks upon a Scaffold, in the most public
Places of London and Westminster, where he confessed the Impostor; and having
after that attempted an escape, he was arraigned and convicted, November. 16.
1499. and on the 23d. of the same Month, drawn and hanged at Tyburn: And the
said Earl of Warwick, upon his Arraignment before his Peers, as consenting to
the same, having confessed the Indictment, and throwing himself upon the King's
Mercy, had Judgment thereupon; and was beheaded on Tower Hill the 28th.
following. And so (after fifteen Years imprisonment) ended this poor Earl, and
with him the Name of Plantagenet. While matters went thus at home, the King of
Scots writes to the Bishop, That because he had several things touching the
Peace of both Crowns, which he would communicate with himself only, he desired
him to come into Scotland; which (with King Henry's approbation) he accordingly
did; and from one thing to another so wrought it, that a Match was concluded
between the said King of Scots, and the Lady Margaret, eldest Daughter of King
Henry, 1501. contracted Jan. 25. 1502. and took effect 1503. the Queen her
Mother having died Feb. 11. before. Nor had this Match been sooner concluded,
than the King married his eldest Son, Arthur Prince of Wales, to the Lady
Catharine, Daughter of Ferdinand King of Spain, November. 14. 1501. After which,
the Prince not living above five Months, his younger Brother Henry (afterward
King Henry VIII.) was created Prince of Wales, Feb. 18. 1503. After which
(besides filling his Coffers) the King did little, saving the getting into his
hands Edmond de la Pool, Son of John de la Pool, Duke of Suffolk, by Elizabeth,
Sister of King Edward IV. who (as pretending to the Crown) had not long before
fled into Flanders; upon the King's Promise nevertheless, That he would not put
him to death, which he observed, but left it to his Son; and died April 22.
1509. in the Fifty second Year of his Age, and Twenty third of his Reign. A
wise, politic Prince, who having the Three Titles of Lancaster, Conquest, and
his Wife Elizabeth, eldest Daughter of King Edward IV. could never be brought
to declare by which of them he claimed. He had Issue by her, 1. Margaret Tudor,
born Nov. 29. 1489. of whom before; Grandmother of Mary Queen of Scots, the
Mother of James VI. King of Scots, in whom the Kingdoms of England and Scotland
were united. 2. Elizabeth Tudor, born July 2. 1492. died Sept. 14 1495. 3. Mary
Tudor, born 1498. promised to Charles Prince of Castile, afterward Emperor;
but upon the death of her Father, married to Lewis XII. King of France. 4.
Catharine Tudor, born Feb. 2. 1503. but died young.


His Sons: 1. Arthur Tudor, Prince of Wales, born September. 20. 1487. died (in
his Father's lifetime) April 2. 1502. 2. Henry Tudor, Duke of York, born June
22. 1492. and succeeded his Father. 3. Edmond Tudor, born Feb. 21. 1498. and
died the Year following.


XX. Upon the death of King Henry VII. his only surviving Son Henry, was the
day following proclaimed King, by the Name of King Henry VIII. His Father's
Funerals, and his own Marriage with the Princess Catharine, Widow of his
Brother Arthur (by the Dispensation of Pope Julius II.) being over, his next
business was their Coronation, which was performed June 24. 1509. and quieting
the Clamours of the People, touching the matter of Sir Richard Empsom, and
Edmond Dudley Esquire; Persons employed by Henry VII. for compounding the
Forfeitures upon Penal Statutes; which they had managed so ill, that being
thereof severally convicted, they were attainted in Parliament of High Treason,
and thereupon beheaded, Aug. 18. 1510. Howbeit, John Dudley, Son and Heir of
the said Edmond, was restored in Blood by the same Parliament; and toward the
latter end of the King, made Viscount Lisle, and Lord High Admiral of England.
The New Years day following, the Queen was brought to bed of a Prince, named
Henry, who died Feb. 22. following. And now the Magnificence of the Court being
somewhat allayed, the King resolved of a Royal Expedition into France, to which
the Parliament gave largely; but not thinking it safe to leave the
beforementioned Edmond de la Pool behind him, he took off his Head, April 30.
1512. and having created Sir Charles Brandon (Son of Sir William Brandon,
Standard Bearer to Henry VII. at Bosworth-Field, and there slain) Viscount
List, he landed at Callice, June 30. 1513. and taking the Field, laid siege to
Terwin; where the Emperor Maximilian taking pay under him, wore the Cross of
St. George, as the King's Soldier. To relieve this Place came the French with a
powerful Army, Aug. 16. but were so put to flight, that (in memory thereof) it
was called The Battle of Spurrs; and the Town surrendered in two days after.
From thence he advanced to the City of Tournay, took it, and returned for
England, September. 24. To divert the King from this pursuit in France, James IV.
of Scotland had invaded England, and besieged Norham Castle, but was
encountered by the Lord Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey (Lieutenant of the North
in the King's absence) at Flodden Field, where the said King lost his Army and
Life together, September. 9. the same Year. On which, the King created the said
Earl Duke of Norfolk, with an augmentation to his Coat, of a Demi-Lion shot in
the Mouth, within a Country Treasure Flowrie, three Parts of the Arms of
Scotland; Sir Charles Brandon Viscount Lisle, Duke of Suffolk, Feb. 2. 1514.
and Thomas Woolsey (his Almoner) Bishop of Lincoln, the March after. Lewis XII.
King of France, now stricken in Years, began to be weary of War; and finding
that the designed Marriage between the Prince of Castile, and the Lady Mary,
Sister of K. Henry, was broken, sent over Ambassadors to treat of a Peace, and
amongst other things, of a Match in particular, between this Lady and himself,
with Offers of a large Dowry, and Security for the same; which, by the
management of Woolsey, was so contrived, that both took effect; with this
Condition, That if the French King died, then the Lady (if it stood with her
Pleasure) might return into England again, with all her Dowry and Riches. Which
being consented to, a Peace was proclaimed Aug. 7. the Marriage consummated
October. 9. the Queen Crowned November. 5 1515. and came to Paris the next day;
where, after several solemn Justs, the English left her; and the King her
Husband died Jan. 1. following. Not long after which, Cardinal Benbrike,
Archbishop of York, King Henry's Ambassador at Rome, dying, Woolsey is made
Archbishop thereof, and (upon the Archbishop of Canterbury Warham's giving up
the Seal) the next Year Lord Chancellor, and Cardinal. Upon the death of King
Lewis, Francis I. succeeded him, to whom, and the Queen his Sister, King Henry
having made the usual Compliments; and being advertised of her Inclination to
return into England, he sent the Duke of Suffolk to receive her; which was
honorably condescended to, and the Queen delivered to him; who pleased her so
well, that she married him at Callice, and returned with him for England, 1516.
The King seems offended at it, but is quickly reconciled: However, the Cardinal
(now Legate a Latere) disobliges him, and not him only, but the Prime Nobility
of England, particularly Edward Stafford Duke of Buckingham (the last
hereditary High Constable of England) whose Head also he brought to the Block,
May 17. 1521. and with that, and his other Exorbitances, the general Hatred of
the Commons upon himself. But what hastened his Ruin may seem to be this:
Charles V. Emperor and King of Spain, had refused him the Archbishopric of
Toledo; to be revenged of this, he procured a Friendship between King Henry and
the King of France, to the end, That if (probably) a Divorce could be made
between the King and Queen (Aunt to the said Emperor) that the King might have
married the Duchess of Alencon, the French King's Sister. However it were, the
King (after a Twenty Years Marriage) makes it a Scruple of Conscience, Whether
she could be his lawful Wife, as having been the Widow of his elder Brother
Prince Arthur; and endeavors a Divorce; from which, the Queen appealed to the
Pope. The Cardinal, on the other hand, finding the King had an eye on the Lady
Anne Bullen, Daughter of Sir Thomas Bulen, Treasurer of his Household, whom he
had created Viscount Rochfort, June 18. 1525. and Earl of Wilis, December. 1529.
and (notwithstanding his Endeavors to the contrary) would marry her, if the
Divorce (to which the Pope was utterly averse) took place; so shuffled the
matter between the Pope and the King, that he fell into the King's displeasure;
which wanting no aggravation of his Enemies (for Friends he had few or none)
the Great Seal was taken from him, Nov. 17. 1529. and Sir Thomas Moore (Speaker
of the House of Commons) made Lord Chancellor, the 24th. of the same Month; and
a Writ of Praemunire issued against him; in which (upon his Confession) he had
Judgment to forfeit all his Lands, Tenements, Goods, and Chattels, etc, of
which he made a large Inventory; and sending it to the King, by Sir William
Gascoigne his Treasurer, retired into the Country: Howbeit, the Bishoprics of
York and Winchester were not taken from him, nor Plate and Household Stuff
sufficient for his Degree. His Power thus clipped, one would have thought it
sufficient; but (alas!) he had a Head yet left, and who knew but the King might
not have quite forgotten him; therefore to make sure Work, and him a terrible
Example, (for those are the Words) there were Forty three Articles, signed by
the said Chancellor, and by Fourteen Lords of the Privy Council, and the Two
Chief Justices, exhibited to the King, against him, December. 1. 1530. which
being brought down from the Lords to the Commons, Thomas Cromwell his Secretary
(a Member of the House) made so honest a Defense of his Master, that the King
took him into his Service. After which, the Lord Chancellor Mocre (as little
fond of having the King marry the Lady Bullen, as had been the Cardinal)
foreseeing the Cloud that was gathering against him, after long suit made to be
discharged of his Office, gave up the Seal, May 7. 1532. and was beheaded for
denying the King's Supremacy, July 6. 1535. or rather, because that he had not
put on his Wedding Garment for the Lady Bullen, whom he made Marchioness of
Pembroke, September. 1. married her Jan. 25. following, in the presence of
Cranmer, his late Ambassador at Rome, whom (not long after) he made Archbishop
of Canterbury. Whereupon it was enacted, That Queen Catharine should no more be
called Queen, but Princess Dowager: And the Archbishop (not to be wanting on
his part) divorced her from the King, and by a Public Sentence, declared the
Marriage to be void and of none effect, May 23. 1533. On which, Queen Anne was
Crowned, June 1. delivered of a Daughter ( Elizabeth, who afterward was Queen)
September. 10. following. And lastly (after a like Divorce) beheaded with a
Sword, May 19. 1536. Three days after whose death (some say sooner) he married
the Lady Jane Seimour, Daughter of Sir John Seimour, who brought him a Son
(Prince Edward, who succeeded him) October the 12th. 1537. and died two days
after. During this ^ime, the Cardinal (with the King's leave) was on his
Journey for York, but arrested of High Treason by the way, and died at
Leicester Abbey, Nov. 30. 1530. ere he could reach London. To him succeeded, in
Favor and Power, his Servant Cromwell; the occasion thus: The Cardinal had (by
the Pope's License) suppressed some small Religious Houses, for the Endowment
of his Colleges of Christ's- Church in Oxford, and Ipswich; which the King made
use of as a Wimble, to let in the greater Augre; and Cromwell, his Instrument
for suppressing the rest. If they voluntarily surrendered, they went off with
Pensions; if otherwise, and that they defended their Possessions, they ran
(Whiting) the Abbot of Glastenbury's Fate, to be hanged for taking Arms against
the King: From which Beginnings, there were first and last dissolved
Monasteries 645. (whereof 26 had Place and Voice among the Peers) Colleges 90.
Chauntries and Free-Chappels 2374. Hospitals 110. Nor was the King wanting to
give him a Figure suitable to the Undertaking; for in the compass of three
Years, he made him Master of the Jewel-House, a Privy Councellor, Secretary,
Master of the Rolls, Lord Privy Seal, and Baron Cromwell, July 10. 1536.
Vicegerent (in Spiritualibus) the 18th. of the same Month: Knight of the
Garter, April 23. 1538. Earl of Essex, and Lord High Chamberlain of England,
April 18. 1540. And his Son Gregory, Baron of Okeham; which Title remained in
his Family, 'till by the death of Vere Cromwell, late Earl of Ardglas in
Ireland, without Issue Male, it was extinct, 1686. The King had now been a
Widower two Years, when Cromwell (thinking to rivet himself in the King's
Favor, by a Queen of his making) negotiated a Match for him with Anne, Sister
of William Duke of Cleve, etc. who was married to him Jan 6. 1540. But the King
not liking her, they were divorced by Act of Parliament, upon her own Consent;
she renouncing the Title of Queen, for that of the King's adopted Sister. And
with this Match fell Cromwell; for it brought him into the King's disfavour:
Nor wanted he Enemies to load him; by whose procurement he was committed to the
Tower, July 9. 1540. and (the King having No More need of him) attainted in
Parliament (of High Treason and Heresy) without so much as being called to
answer; and thereupon beheaded, the 19th. of the same Month. His FIFTH Wife was
the Lady Catharine Howard, Daughter of Edmond, third Son of Thomas, first Duke
of Norfolk; whom also he attainted in Parliament, and beheaded, Feb. 13. 1541.
The Year following, the Title of Lord of Ireland, was (by the respective
Parliaments of both Kingdoms) altered into that of King of Ireland: And to
encourage such of the Irish Nobility as came in to him, he created O Brian,
Earl of Thoumond, June 3. 1543. And Mac-William a-Burgh, Earl of Clanricart,
July 1. following; and 12th. of the same Month married the Lady Catharine Parr,
Widow of the Lord Latimer, who had the luck to survive him; and was afterward
married to the Lord Admiral Seimour. Nor had he (after that Year) the
opportunity of doing much, saving that he landed an Army in Scotland, under the
Conduct of the Lord Admiral Dudley, who burnt Lies to the ground, forced
Edinburgh; and having fired it (as also Thirty other Towns and Villages) came
back for England, by Berwick, 1544. And to close the last Scene of his Life, he
made a Royal Voyage into France, and besieged Boloigne; which by the Personal
Courage and Conduct of the said Lord Admiral, was surrendered, and the King
rode triumphantly into it, Sept. 8. the same Year, and made him Governor
thereof. For the recovery of this, the French made several attempts; but all
unsuccessful: Whereupon it was at last concluded between the two Kings, That if
the King of France paid the King of England 800000 Crowns in eight Years, he
should have Boloigne restored to him; and that in the mean time, it should
remain in the King of England's hands, as a Security for the Money, June 7.
1547. After which, falling into a Dropsy, he died Jan. 28. following, being
the Fifty fifth Year of his Age, and Thirty seventh of his Reign. He had the
Soul of a Prince, Magnificent and Liberal; and whatever may be said of
King-Craft, understood what it was to be a King: Nor were the Popes Julius II.
and Leo X. less sensible of it; which made them so forward to have engaged him
to their Interest: For the former having by a Decree of the Council of Lateran,
deprived the King of France of the Title of Christianissimus, transferred it to
him; but died before the Bull was sent over, 1514. and the latter granted to
him (and Poster is suis) the Title of Defensor Fidei, 1521. His Wives (as has
been said) were SIX; but he had Issue only by the Three first; viz. By Queen
Catharine, 1. Henry Tudor, born Jan. 1. 1509. and died Feb. 22. following. 2.
Another, not Named, born 1514. but lived not long. 3. Mary Tudor, born Feb. 18.
1518. and afterward came to be Queen of England.


By Queen Anne Bullen: 1. Elizabeth Tudor, born September. 10. 1533. who
succeeded her Half Sister Mary in the Crown. 2. A Male-Child still-born, Feb.
29. 1535.


By Queen Jane:

Edward, born as before; made Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall, and Earl of
Chester, October. 18. 1537.

His Natural Issue:

Henry, surnamed Fitz Roy, begotten on the Lady Elizabeth Talbois, Daughter of
Sir John Blount Knight. and Widow of Sir Gilbert Talbois; created Earl of
Nottingham, June 18. 1525. and the same day Duke of Richmond and Somerset. Died
without Issue, his Father living, 1536.

XXI. To his Father, succeeded his only Son Prince Edward VI. (a Protestant) to
whom being yet but Nine Years of Age, his Mother's Brother, Sir Edward Seimour
(created Viscount Beauchamp, 1536. Earl of Hertford, 1538.) was appointed
Governor, proclaimed Lord Protector, Feb. 1. 1547. and made Duke of Somerset
the 17th. of the same Month: At which time also, his younger Brother, Sir
Thomas Seimour, was made Lord Sudley, and High Admiral of England; the late
Lord Admiral Dudley, Earl of Warwick; the Lord Chancellor Wriothsley, Earl of
Southampton; and the King Crowned the 25th. following. Whereupon the
REFORMATION began; but the Lord Chancellor seeming averse to it, was removed
from the Privy Council, discharged of all his Offices, and Sir William Pawlett,
Lord St. John, made Chancellor in his room. In which Year, the Parliament
having given the King Free-Chappels, etc. he set out the Free-Chappel of St.
Stephen, founded by King Stephen, for a place of Sitting for the House of
Commons, which before that time had been in the Chapter House of the Abbot of
Westminster. And now Commissioners being appointed for matter of Religion (not
yet disannulled by Parliament) it came into the Protector's and Council's mind,
of a Match that (upon the death of King James V. King of Scotland) had been
treated and concluded by the Parliament of that Kingdom, with King Henry VIII.
for the Prince his Son (now King) with the Lady Mary their young Queen, sole
Daughter and Heir of the said James; and which, by the Contrivance of Cardinal
Beaton, Archbishop of St. Andrew's, was now obstructed, to the intent of
marrying her to Francis Dauphin of France; as it afterward took effect, April
24. 1558. To have prevented this, an Army is raised, and Scotland invaded by
Sea and Land; where, after several Skirmishes, the Protector engaged them at
Fauxside and Musleborough; whence, after a great Slaughter, and having secured
a Footing in the Country, he returned for England the September following: But
(as to the young Queen) did so little good, that it was doubted, Whether this
Army (and that too for a great part Foreigners) was rather raised to force a
Princess out of her own Country, to the Marriage of a Prince not yet ripe for
her, than to secure himself at home. During this, and his Brother the Lord
Admiral's absence in Scotland, whether it were that the Protector's Wife could
not brook the Queen Dowager Parr, her Husband's (the Admiral's) younger
Brother's Wife, to take place of her; or that the Admiral kept not
thorough-pace with him, there grew such a feud between the Brothers, that cost
them both their Heads: For within a Year and half after their return, the
Admiral was sent to the Tower, and (without Trial) attainted in Parliament; and
thereupon beheaded, March 20. 1549. Nor had he recovered this false Step,
before he made another, in slipping an Opportunity that played into his hand;
for the Commissioners having thrown all Images, and what thereunto appertained,
out of the Churches, and the Parliament abolished the Missal, and enjoined a
New Book of Common Prayer, and Administration of the Sacraments in its room,
the Cornish Men first, and after them, Oxfordshire, Bucking, hamshire, Norfolk,
York, and others, ran into Rebellion, which he fortunately suppressed, and
thereby became Master of an Army, which he might have wrought to any thing, at
least crushed his disguised Friend, but secret Enemy, the Earl of Warwick, who
had stola the Lords of the Council from him, and now jointly impeached him, as
the occasion of the late Tumults; and at the same time pray the City and the
Commons, to aid them to take him from the King: Whereupon he is committed to
the Tower, October. 14 following; and having not Interest enough to hinder the
said Earl from being made Lord High-Chamberlain, he tamely submitted to a
Marriage between the Earl's eldest Son, and his eldest Daughter, and got his
Liberty for that time. But this patched Friendship lasted not above two Years;
for the Earl of Warwick being made Duke of Northumberland, and the Lord Henry
Gray Marquess of Dorset (his Consident) Duke of Suffolk, October. 11. 1551. and
now Governing all, the late Protector was (within five days after) again
committed to the Tower, and convicted of Felony, upon a Statute of his own
making; viz. For purposing and attempting the Lives of (the said Northumberland
and Suffolk) two of the King's Privy Council, which by that Statute was made
Felony. On which, he was beheaded Jan. 22. following: And the King left so
unguarded by any but themselves and their Creatures, that it seemed no
difficulty to bring the Crown into their own Families. To this purpose, a
Marriage is contrived between the Lord Guilford Dudley, Fourth Son of the said
Duke of Northumberland, and the Lady Jane Gray, eldest Daughter of the said
Duke of Suffolk, by Frances, Daughter of Mary, Sister of King Henry VIII. of
whom before; and that so covered under the specious Pretense of securing the
Protestant Religion, against the Lady Mary the King's Sister, a Catholic, that
the King not only furthered it, but being in a sickly condition, did by his
last Will and Testament, declare the said Lady Jane Gray, to be Rightful Heir
in Succession to the Crown of England. To which also (besides the Lords of the
Council) all the Judges subscribed their Names, excepting only Sir. James Hales
(one of the Justices of the Common Pleas) who would neither by Word nor Writing
give his Assent to the disherison of Queen Mary: Not long after which, the King
died, to wit, July 6. 1553. in the Seventeenth Year of his Age, and Seventh of
his Reign; but unmarried, and Childless, and might (perhaps) have lived longer,
if he had not been a King.

Three days after, the Lady Jane Gray was proclaimed Queen; and the same day
the Lady Mary, Sister of the last King Edward, and eldest Daughter of King
Henry VIII. sent a Letter to the Lords of the Council, thereby claiming the
Crown by Right of Succession; and requiring them upon their Allegiance, to have
her proclaimed Queen. Which being slighted by them, she withdrew to her Castle
of Fremingham, whither several of the Nobility and Gentry repair to her. The
Council, on the other hand, dispatch the Duke of Northumberland after her; but
the Men of Suffolk first, and after them, those of Oxfordshire, Northampton,
and Norfolk, came in so thick to her, and six Ships of War declaring for her,
the Council at London proclaim her Queen, the 19th. of the same Month; left the
Duke of Northumberland to shift for himself, and secured the Lady Jane, and her
Husband in the Tower.

XXII. Queen Mary (a Catholic) being thus proclaimed, the Duke of
Northumberland was arrested at Cambridge, and brought to the Tower; and
(together with the Marquess of Northampton, and the Earl of Warwick, Son and
Heir of the said Duke) arraigned of High Treason before Thomas Duke of Norfolk,
Lord High-Steward of England; where praying the Opinion of the Court, Whether a
Man doing an Act by Authority of the Prince's Council, and by Warrant of the
Great Seal of England, and doing nothing without the same, may be charged with
Treason for any thing done by virtue of the same? And being answered, That the
Great Seal which he laid for his Warrant, was not the Seal of the Lawful Queen
of the Realm, but the Seal of an Usurper, and therefore no Warrant to him; he
confessed the Indictment (as also did the other two) and had Judgment, as in
Cases of High Treason, Aug. 18. the same Year: On which, the said Duke was
beheaded the 22d. and Queen Mary Crowned October. 1. following: At which time
also, she published a General Pardon; in which notwithstanding, were excepted
by Name, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishop of London, and
others of the Clergy; and the two Chief Justices, Sir Edward Montacute, and Sir
Roger Cholmley, with other Men of the Law, for counselling, or at least
consenting to the Deprivation of Queen Mary, and aiding the aforesaid Duke of
Northumberland, in the pretended Right of the beforementioned Lady Jane; who
(with her Husband) were arraigned and attainted Nov. 3. next ensuing, as also
was Archbishop Cranmer. The beginning of January following, the Emperor
Charles V. sent over Ambassadors, fully empowered to treat and conclude a
Marriage between Queen Mary, and Philip Prince of Spain, his Son and Heir;
which afterward took effect. But this Match being not so well relished by the
Commons, nor much better by some of the Nobility, it was confederated between
them to raise a War, rather than suffer such a Change of State, as they doubted
might follow, by the Queen's thus Matching her self with a Stranger. The first
that appeared in it was Sir Tho. Wiat (a powerful Man in Kent.) The occasion
thus: A near Friend of his, one of the Conspirators, was committed to the Fleet
(by the Council) for other matters; whereupon Sir Thomas suspecting that the
Plot was discovered, ran into Arms before the time that had been appointed
between them: However, having gotten a strong Party together, he published a
Declaration (at Maidstone in Kent) against the said Marriage; and thereby
desired his Friends, and all English Men, to join with him and others, to
defend the Realm from the danger of being brought in Thraldom to Strangers:
Whereupon several considerable Persons, with their Followers, came in to him.
And the Duke of Suffolk made the like Proclamation in Leicester. Nor wanted the
Queen, on the other hand, such as gathered as fast to suppress them; for the
Lord Abergavenny having opposed him in Kent and Coventry, shut their Gates
against the Duke of Suffolk, there seemed nothing to the contrary, but the Duke
of Norfolk, by this time gone down against him, must have swallowed him; as
probably he had done, but that 500 of the London White-Coats that went with
him, revolted, and took part with Wiat. Upon which, the Duke made what retreat
he could, and Wiat went on for London; but being beaten off at London Bridge,
he got over at Kingston, and was so encountered from Park Corner to St.
James's, and thence to Charing Cross, and through the Strand, that being not
able to make further than Temple-Earr, where he met a fresh Opposition, he
delivered himself, and was sent to the Tower Feb. 7. following; and in two days
after, the Duke of Suffolk. The Lord Guilford Dudley, and the Lady Jane his
Wife, behead the 12th. and the 23d. of the same Month, the Duke himself; and
Sir Thomas Wiat headed and quartered, but neither drawn nor hanged, April 11.
1555. his Head set upon the Gallows, and his Quarters about the City. After
which, the Marriage between the Queen and Prince Philip of Spain, was openly
solemnized, July 25. the same Year, and a Parliament opened November. 12.
following, in which Reginald Pool, Cardinal, (Legate a Latere from Pope Julius
III. not many days before landed in England) was restored in Blood, and the Act
of Henry VIII. by which he was attainted, repealed; and the Kingdom reconciled,
and absolved, the 29th. of the same Month (but not before an Act had first
passed, for securing Abbey-Lands in the hands of the present Possessors) and
the Cardinal made Archbishop of Canterbury, the March following. In the Year
1557. the Queen (to compliment her Husband) proclaimed a War against France;
and at the same time held Callice so unprovided, that the Duke of Guise ^in
revenge of the Loss of St. Quintin) surpised it, and took it in a Week's time,
after it had been in the English possession 211 Years. It was said that the
Queen was with Child, and a solemn Office appointed to be used in all Churches
for her safe Delivery; but it proved a Mola (or false Conception) of which
shedied, without Issue, November. 17. 1558. in the Thirty ninth Year of her Age,
and Sixth of her Reign. And the same day died the said Cardinal Pool, a younger
Son of Sir Richard Pool, Knight of the Garter, by the Lady Elizabeth, Countess
of Salisbury, Daughter of George Duke of Clarence, Brother of King Edward IV.
and left the Kingdom reconciled, as has been said. Yet this hindered not, but
that

XXIII. The Lady Elizabeth, Half Sister to Queen Mary by the Father (a
Protestant) was proclaimed Queen, and Crowned Jan. 25. following. She rescinded
whatever the Queen her Sister had done in matters of Religion, and proceeded
upon what her Brother King Edward VI. had begun: Amongst the rest, she
suppressed such Religious Houses, as were anew set up by Queen Mary, as Sion,
Sheen, Westminster, etc. This last Monastery was in the Year 1539. surrendered
to Henry VIII. who erected thereof a Dean and Chapter; and in 1542. raised it
to a Bishopric, of which he made Thomas Th^^^bye the first Bishop, who proved
the last also: for the Queen made it a College, consisting of a Dean, Twelve
Prebends, a Schoolmaster, an Usher, Forty Scholars, Twelve Almsmen, and named
it the Collegiate Church of Westminster. The Reformation of Edward VI. in
England, had by this time reached Scotland, which the Queen Dowager (by
assistance of the French) strongly opposed; and many of the Scots Nobility on
the other hand, make suit to Queen Elizabeth (under the Name of The Lords of
the Congregation) for her Aid against Popery, and them; which was readily
granted, and a considerable Army sent into Scotland, 1560. where after various
Fortune on either side, and the death of the Queen Dowager of Scotland, a Peace
was concluded between Queen Elizazeth, and Francis and Mary, King and Queen of
France, and Scotland, about July following; immediately after which, died the
said Francis, leaving his Crown to his younger Brother Charles, and the said
Mary Queen of Scotland, Queen Dowager of France, who (though laid wait for to
be intercepted) took the opportunity of a Mist, and got safely into Scotland,
1562. from whence she sent Letters to Queen Elizabeth, proffering all
observance and readiness to enter into League with her, so she might by
Authority of Parliament be declared her Successor which was but her Right. To
which the Queen answered, That though she would no way derogate from her Right,
yet she should be loath to endanger her own Security, and, as it were, cover her
Eyes with a Grave-Cloth while she was alive. And here began the Jealousies of
State between the two Queens; the one doubting her Succession was intended to
be frustrated; and the other, That her Possession might be invaded. And yet
they kept it so fair with each other, that the Queen of Scots being, in 1563.
follicited by her Uncle the Cardinal of Lorrain, to a Marriage with Charles
Archduke of Austria (with an Offer of the Arrears of her Dowry, and a
Restoration of the Scots to their former Liberties in France, which by the
death of her Uncle, the Duke of Guise, had been broken, in case she would
adhere to the French (against whom the Queen of England had about that time
assisted the Hugonots) she gives her notice of it, and requires her Advice in
it. Queen Elizabeth, on the other hand, persuades her to take a Husband out of
England, and recommends to her the Lord Robert Dudley (whom not long after she
made Earl of Leicester) withal promising, That if she would marry him, she
should by Authority of Parliament be declared her Successor, in case she died
without Issue: But whether it were that she disdained the one, or that she was
loath to make a breach with England, by accepting the other, nothing came of
either. But having (by the leave of Queen Elizabeth) gotten Henry Lord Darnly,
Son of Matthew Stuart Earl of Lenox, by Margaret Douglas, Niece of Henry VIII.
by his eldest Sister, out of England (upon pretense of restoring him to the
Possessions of his Father, who had been in England as an Exile now twenty
years, made him Lord Armanack, Earl of Ross, and Duke of Rothsey, a Dukedom by
Birth appertaining to the eldest Sons of the Kings of Scotland, married him in
five Months after, and with the Consent of most of the Peers of Scotland,
declared him King, about June 1565. A Person of a Princely Presence, and not
above Nineteen Years of Age.

The Prior of St. Andrew's, the Queen's base Brother, but one, that more
affecting a Temporal Honor, than a Spiritual Title, had been made Earl of
Murray, had underhand dealt with Queen Elizabeth, to have prevented this
Marriage; in excuse of which, the Queen was let know, She had no reason to be
displeased with it, inasmuch as she had followed her Advice, Not to marry a
Stranger, but an Englishman born. Nor (perhaps) was Queen Elizabeth much
troubled at it, as knowing the mild Disposition of the Lord Darnly, and how
little of Strength it added to the Queen of Scots; but, on the contrary,
foreseeing it would beget Troubles in Scotland, which was the Security of
England. However it were, the Queen of Scots being brought to Bed of a Son,
June 19. 1566. she sent Queen Elizabeth notice of it, who congratulated her
safe Deliverance, and her Son, and was his Godmother; and by her, and the
respective Ambassadors of Charles King of France, and Philibert Duke of Savoy,
gave him the Name of Charles James, in whom afterward, in Right of his said
Mother, the Crowns of England and Scotland came to be united.

Murray thus disappointed where he least expected, complies with the present,
and strikes in with the yet Inadvertency of the young King, and makes a
Division between the Queen and him; which his Instruments so improved with her,
that whereas before in public Acts she had used to place her Husband's Name
first, she now caused it to be placed last; and in her Coin, began to leave it
out quite. Nor was the Breach yet so wide, but it might have been closed again,
had not Murray created a Jealou^ie in him concerning one David Rizie (an
Italian) the Queen's Secretary and told him plainly it stood not with his
Honor to suffer him to live; which so netled the King, that rushing one
Evening into the Queen's Chamber when she was at Supper, he caused the said
Rizie to be dragged out of her presence, and murdered, of which afterward the
King grew so sensible, that he threatened a Revenge upon Murray, who had
counseled him to it; which the other prevented in striking the first Blow, by
procuring the King to be strangled in his Bed, his Body thrown into the Garden,
and the House immediately blown up; the Queen, whatever the Rumor of the
People were, least doubitng her Brother Murray. And here comes his Masterpiece.

The Earls of Bothwell and Morton, had been his Confederates in the Murder; and
when the Days of Mourning were a little over, Murray, by himself and his
Instruments, insinuates to her the danger of the Kingdom by her being thus left
alone, and advises her to marry some one that might be able to assist her
against all her Opposers; and after some time, recommends Bothwell to her, a
Person in favor with her, and of great Eminence for his Valor: To which,
being destitute of Friends, she at last consents, provided due respect might be
had to her young Son, and that Bothwell legally acquit himself of her Husband's
Murder. Whereupon Bothwell stands his Trial, and is acquitted by his Judges: On
which, the Queen makes him Duke of Orkney, and by Consent of many of the
Nobility, marries him, 1567. And now Murray is where he would be; for having,
during Queen Mary's abode in France, by his Patriarch Knox, and his Chaplain
Buchannan, (under PRETENSE of Reformation) embroiled the Kingdom, by affirming,
That Royalty was not tied to any Stock or Kindred, but Virtue only, whether the
Parties were legitimate or not; thereby making way to the Kingdom for himself;
and not being able to have hindered the Queen's second Marriage, made a Discord
between her and him, whom he afterward murdered; this Murray, the same Man
that had acquitted Bothwell, and not only advised, but promoted his Marriage
with the Queen, now takes Arms against her, as privy to Bothwell's Murder of
her Husband. On this, Bothwell finding himself outwitted, flies into Denmark;
and Murray seizes the Queen, and vilely threw her into Prison in Loch-levyn,
under the Custody of his Mother, the Concubine of James V. but now boasting
herself to have been his Wife, and her Son his lawful Issue. During which time,
Knox and his Disciples thunder against her from the Pulpits: Buchannan, with
his De Jure Regni apud Scotos, and Murray with his armed Logic so terrify
her, that she resigned her Kingdom to her Son, scarce Thirteen Months old, and
made Murray Regent of Scotland during his Minority; alleging to Queen
Elizabeth for her so doing, That she had done it through the Counsel of
her-Ambassadour Throckmorton, who told her, That a Grant extorted from one in
Prison (which is a just Fear) is actually void, and of none effect. However, on
this the young King was Crowned, and Murray proclaimed Regent; but the Queen
still kept in Prison; from whence (after Eleven Months imprisonment) by the
help of one of the Douglas's, she makes an escape to Hamilton-Castle, where, in
a meeting of a great part of the Nobility, this extorted Resignation of the
Queen's, is declared actually void from the beginning. Whereupon Multitudes
flock in to her; but being undisciplined, they are defeated by Murray; Herself
nevertheless making an escape into England, landed at Wickington in Cumberland,
May 17. 1568. having first sent her Servant Beaton to Queen Elizabeth, to
intimate her Intention; with a Diamond Ring also, which she had formerly
received from her, as a Pledge of mutual Amity. Nor was she sooner landed than
she wrote her a Letter, thereby declaring her Condition; and withal desiring
she might be conducted to her Presence. To which, Queen Elizabeth, by a Letter
sent by Sir Francis Knolles, returned her a comfortable Answer, and promised
her Aid and Defense, according to the Equity of her Cause; but denied her
access, for that she was held guilty of many Crimes; and therefore ordered her
to be brought to Carlisle. From thence she seconded her first Letter, further
praying, That she might have leave to unfold the Injuries she had received, and
answer the Crimes objected in her presence; withal alleging, It was but
reasonable that the Queen should hear her, and restore her to her Kingdom,
against those, whom when they lived in exile for their Offenses against her,
she had fully restored at the Queen's Intercession, but to her own undoing, if
not prevented in time. Lastly, beseeching her, That she might have admittance
to her, and assistance from her, or depart out of the Kingdom with her leave,
to crave aid elsewhere, forasmuch as she came into it of her own accord, as
relying upon her Love, so often honorably promised, by Letters, Messages, and
Tokens. Upon this, the Queen commiserating her Condition, could have found in
her Heart to have restored her, had the Council thought it stood with the
Queen's security: And therefore the Question was, What should be done with her?
To detain her in England, it was to be feared those that favored her Title to
the Crown, would leave nothing unattempted to set it on her Head: And moreover,
the Trust of Keepers was very uncertain: To send her for France, the Guises
(her Kindred) were too powerful; and to return her into Scotland, those that
favored the English would be put from their Places; the French advanced; the
young King exposed to danger; the Religion changed; Ireland invaded by the
Highlanders; and Queen Elizabeth in hazard at home: And therefore it was
thought best to detain her, 'till she had given satisfaction for usurping the
Title and Arms of England, and anser'd for the Death of the Lord Darnly, a
Native Subject of the Queen's. Yet it had this effect, That the Queen sent to
Murray and his Confederates, to come and answer the Queen of Scots's
Complaints, and give sufficient Reasons why they had deprived her, or that she
would restore her. On which, Murray with seven others came to York (the Place
appointed) and were the same Day met by the Duke of Norfolk, and two others,
Commissioners for Queen Elizabeth: But the Queen of Scots disdaining to be
heard by her Subjects, or any thing less than the Queen her self, nothing came
of it but Words: And Murray returned to his Regency; but riding through
Lithquo, was shot dead by a Hamilton, 1569. In whose room was elected, by the
Lords of Scotland, the beforementioned Matthew Earl of Lenox, the young King's
Grandfather. And now frequent applications having been made to Queen Elizabeth,
by the Ambassadors of France and Spain, for the Delivery of the Queen of
Scots, but without effect, she was Excommunicated by Pope Pius V. Feb. 24. the
same Year; which occasioned her many Troubles, and at last the death of the
Queen of Scots; who after an Eighteen Years imprisonment, was arraigned, tried,
and sentenced (by 'special Commission) at Fotheringham-Castle; for that
pretending a Title to the Crown of England, she was privy and consenting to
several Treasons, tending to the Invasion of England, and the Hurt, Death, and
Destruction of the Queen, October. 25. 1586. And thereupon, Infesto Regibus
Exemplo (as says her Epitaph) securi percutitur, Feb. 8. following, and Forty
sixth Year of her Age; albeit the King of France, and more particularly the
King of Scots her Son, and several others, made strong Intercessions to have
saved her. However, the Queen seems troubled at her Death, and lays it to the
Inconsiderateness of her Secretary Davyson; and to that purpose sent a Letter
in excuse of it (written with her own Hand) by Sir Robert Carry, whom the King
refused to set foot in Scotland; and with much ado receiving his Letter, re
called his Ambassador, and breathed nothing but Revenge. And yet the Queen
gave not over; but sending him the Sentence of the Star Chamber against
Davyson, and an Instrument signed by all the Judges; in which they averr, That
the Sentence against the Queen of Scott, could in no wise prejudice his Right
in the Succession; it so mollified, that he made a Virtue of Necessity; and
chose rather to wait with Patience th^n hazard all by an uncertain War with
England.

And now come that Climacterical Year of the World (as Astrologers called it)
to wit, 1588, at what time (there being an actual Treaty then on foot between
the Crowns of England and Spain, and Commissioners on both sides then sitting
upon it near Ostend, but made use of by the Prince of Parma, only to trifle
away time, 'till the Spanish Armada came upon the English Coast) Philip II.
King of Spain makes an attempt upon England, with 130 Ships, whereof 72 were
Galeasses and Galleons; in which were 19290 Soldiers, besides Mariners and
Gally-Slaves; to have been joined by the Prince of Parma with 50000 Veterans:
But where ever lay the Miscarriage abroad, every hand was so at work at home,
that enobling our Coasts with their mighty Spoils, those few of them that
escaped, returned with more Confasion, than they set forth with Expectation.
After which, the King of Scots, by her Ambassidour (Sir Robert Sidney) let the
Queen know, That he had over-pass'd all Injuries, and desired a sincere and
perfect Amity with her: And as an instance of it, not only married Anne,
Daughter of Frederick II. King of Denmark, with the Queen's good liking, 1589.
But when O Rork, having rebelled against her in Ireland, was driven into
Scotland, he was, upon the Queen's Request, delivered back into Ireland, 1590.
Nor was there after that any Solemnity of an Embassy ever passed between them,
but as occasion offered, it was constantly dispatched by a private Messenger,
'till the day of her death; which the Scots had a long time impatiently
expected, but believed never would be, while there was an Old Woman alive in
England; though at last it came to pass, March 24. 1602. in the 69th. year of her
Age, and 45th. of her Reign. But never married.

XXIV.. VIII. To her succeeded James VI. Kiug of Scotland, Grandchild of James
IV. King of Scotland, by Margaret, eldest Daughter of Henry VII. King of
England; who (the Male Line being extinct) had the indisputable Title to the
Crowns of England and Ireland; and was thereupon proclaimed King of England,
Scotland, and Ireland, the same Day that the Queen died: Of which he had first
notice by an unsent Messenger, the beforementioned Sir Robert Carry, whom (upon
his coming into England) he some Years after made Baron Leppington: And upon a
more solemn Address from the Lords of the Council, came for England, and was
(together with his Queen) Crowned, July 25. 1603. being St. James's Day: A
little before which, there having been several Embassies made to Congratulate
their Access to the Crown, the King created a Standing Officer for the
Reception and Introduction of Ambassadors, by the Name of Master of the
Ceremonies, with the yearly Fee of 200 l. of whom the first was Sir Lewis
Lakenor. Nor had the King been scarce warm in his Throne, when the Lord Cobham,
and others, were arraigned and convicted of High Treason, for a Conspiracy to
kill the King, raise a Rebellion, alter Religion, subvert the State, and
procure an Invasion; of which Sir Walter Raleigh (a mortal Enemy to Spain, and
no Friend of the Scots) was one; and after a Fourteen Years reprieval (by the
means of the Spanish Lieger Gundomar) had his Head taken off upon the former
Judgment, though there wanted not those that thought it was Jure and Injuria.
And now came on the Business of Spain: As King of Scotland, the King was in
Amity with Spain; as King of England, at War with it: And therefore finding
himself under that double Circumstance, he first called in all Letters of Mart
against the Spaniard, and not long after, concluded a Peace with them; to the
Confirmation of which, Albertus and Isabella, Archdukes of Austria, were sworn.
And thus in Peace with all Christendom, the King created his Second Son Charles
Duke of Albany (then Four Years old) Duke of York, Jan. 2. 1604. with the
yearly Fee of 40 l. payable by the Sheriff of York out of the Issues, etc. of
that County.

The Year following was discovered the Gunpowder Treason Plot, which ended in
the Attainder and Death of the Conspirators; and was particularly congratulated
by the King of Spain, and Archdukes of Austria. In the Year 1610. the King
(having had an Aid of his Subjects to make his Son a Knight) created Prince
Henry (now Seventeen Years of Age) Prince of Wales; but he lived not long to
enjoy it; for during the Treaty of a Marriage between Frederick Prince Palatine
of the Rhine, with the Lady Elizabeth, the King's only Daughter, he sell sick,
and died, November. 6. 1612. However, the Marriage took effect, and was
consummated on St. Valentine's Day following: And Prince Charles created Prince
of Wales, 1615. But hear the time the King had created his Son Henry Prince of
Wales, he created a new Patent-Honour of descendible Knighthood, by the Name of
Knights Baronets. The occasion thus:

In the beginning of the King's Reign, Charles Lord Montjoy, Lord Deputy of
Ireland, returned for England, and brought over with him Hugh O Neal, Earl of
Tyrone, who (Queen Elizabeth yet living) had submitted himself to the Queen's
Mercy, and whom the King pardoned; and made proclamation, That he should be
treated with Respect and Honor. And yet in 1609. he goes off into Ireland; and
with Tyrconnel and others, gets Beyond Sea, and sollicites a new Assistance
from foreign Princes; but having left several forfeited Lands behind them, in
the Counties of Colerain, Tyrone, and Donegal, the King comes to Articles with
the City of London for the planting and building the same: Which being
accepted, the King by his Charter, 1611. erects the Ville of Derry into a City,
and the Town of Colerain into a Mayor-Town; and, together with the said
forfeited Lands, consolidates the whole into one County; by the Name of the
County of Londonderry: And having by the same Charter created a Body Politic
of Twenty four Persons (Twelve of them to be annually elected out of the Twelve
First Companies of London) for the Government of the same, by the Name of The
Society of the Governor and Assistants, London, of the New Plantation of
Ulster in the Realm of Ireland, grants the said City, Town, County, and
forfeited Lands, to the said Society, and their Successors in perpetuity, under
the yearly Rent of 205 l. And now to give Countenance to it, and put 200000 l.
in his Pocket, without being beholden to his Subjects, he erected this new
Honor; and for him, his Heirs and Successors, covenanted with each of them
respectively, That they, and the Heirs Males of their Body, should take Place
next the youngest Sons of Barons: That (by way of augmentation to their own
Arms) they should bear a part of O Neal's Arms; viz. in a Canton, or Escutcheon
Argent, a hand Dextre couped, Gules: And lastly, stinted their Number to Two
hundred Persons; whose Issue, as they chanced to fail, should not be supplied
with new Persons, but the Order to run out. In which last Clause yet, the King
covenanted for himself only, and left out his Heirs and Successors; though (if
the printed Lists be true) Himself made Two hundred and One. In consideration
of which, each of them was to maintain Thirty Foot-Soldiers in Ireland for
Three Years, after the rate of Eight-pence a Day; and for the payment of the
Moneys, strike a Tally in the Exchequer for 1000 l.

The King also, some time after, erected a like Order of Baronets of Nova
Scotia; who instead of the said Hand dextre couped, should wear an
Orange-colour'd Ribbon athwart their Shoulders (as Knights of the Bath their
Red Ribbon) with a Medal, on which the Arms of Scotland were enameled, and a
Pear-Pearl at the end of it; with this Motto: Faxment is honestae Gloria. But
whether (besides the advantage of another Plantation) he got as much by the
one, as he did by the other, does not appear: Though this may be said of both,
All Parties were well satisfied. Nor happened there, during this time, any
thing much remarkable, saving the breaking one Favorites Neck, to make way for
another; the placing and displacing of Great Officers; the frequent Creations
of Nobility; which though it added to their Number, may (perhaps) be thought to
have taken from their Grandeur, and the Death of Queen Anne, which happened
March 2. 1619.

The Palsgrave Frederick thus strengthened with the Alliance of England, was,
in the Year 1621. elected King of Bohemia: Nor was he sooner invested in the
Crown, than the Imperial Bann issued against him; which was so seconded with a
longer Sword, that having lost the Battle of Prague, and with it his New Crown,
and his own Patrimony of the Upper and Lower Palatinate, he was forc' to retire
into Holland. On this, King James (though he never could be brought to own his
Son-in-Law as a King) had that care of his Daughter, that he sent an Embassy
to the Emperor, to solicit the Restitution of the Palatinate; which
returning without success, he consults Gundomar what to do in the matter; who
advises him to make a Marriage with the Prince his Son, and the Infanta of
Spain, Which (said he) would be easily effected, if the Prince might have leave
to make a Journey into Spain. Which was accordingly done, and the Prince
received with all the Kindness and Magnificence imaginable: Where having been
spun out for eight Months together to no purpose (contrary to the Expectation
of most Men) he returned safe into England. Whereupon the King taking new
measures, it was first resolved to recover the Palatinate by Arms, in which the
Parliament promised him a liberal Assistance; and next, to provide the Prince a
Wife elsewhere: For which purpose, an Embassy was sent into France, to treat
of a Marriage with Henrietta Maria, younger Daughter of King Henry IV. and
Sister of Lewis XIII. King of France; which took effect, but was not
consummated 'till after the Death of King James, which happened March 27. 1625.
in the Fifty eighth Year of his Age, and of his Reign of England the Twenty
second, and of Scotland the Fifty sixth. He had but one Wife, viz. Queen Anne,
of whom before; and by her, 1. Henry Friderick Stuart, Prince of Wales, Duke of
Cornwall and Rothsey, and Earl of Chester; born (in Scotland) Feb. 19. 1593.
died Nov. 6. 1612. 2. Robert Stuart, born and died very young in Scotland. 3.
Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, and, Princess Palatine of the Rhine; born
Aug. 19. 1596. (in Scotland) died Feb. 13. 1661. 4. Margaret Stuart; born (in
Scotland) December. 24. 1598. died young. 5. Charles Stuart, Duke of York and
Albany; born November. 19. 1600. succeeded his Father. 6. Mary Stuart; born (in
England) March-1605. died two Years after. And, 7. Sophia Stuart; born (in
England) June 21. 1606. died two days after.


XXV. To his Father (his elder Brother being dead) succeeded Charles, the First
of that Name, about the Age of Twenty five Years, and was proclaimed King the
same Day his Father died: The Solemnity of whose Funerals being over, the first
thing he did was to hasten the coming over of the Queen, to whom he was married
by Proxy at Paris, May 1. and consummated at Canterbury, June 13. following. Of
this Prince it may be truly said, He was a Man of Sorrows: And yet, if there be
any thing in History to be named before him, it is not that He was less able,
but their Times better. Therefore for the truer understanding of both, it is
the least Justice we can do His MEMORY, to consider under what ill
Circumstances He came to the Crown.

There had followed his Father, out of Scotland, Two Sorts of People; the One
purely for the Loaves; the Other, to double the Interest of that Doctrine, that
had forced his Mother out of Her Kingdom, who kept himself so long in
Pupillage, and to which England was not so altogether a Stranger, but that they
found the Lump leven'd to their hand. Some (like them) calling also themselves
the Lord's Ambassadors, and pretending a Right from God, to Govern every one
his Parish, and their Assembly the whole Nation: Others (and those different in
Opinions among themselves) that would have all Congregations free, and
independent upon one another: Others, That held Christ's Personal Reign was at
this time to begin upon Earth, and therefore would have no other King but King
Jesus: Besides several others (from the first Litter) yet every of them
desending its Sect by Scripture, according to the narrow scantling of their own
Interpretations. These again meeting with a Purse-proud City, a poor Crown, and
a Gentry that no less affected a Popular Government in the State, than
themselves did in the Church; Both cry up Liberty, and inveigh against Tyranny
(that is) whatever they were not themselves. And so, what wonder of those
Consequents that embroiled the King's Reign! The ill Effects of which too many
have seen, and may (perhaps) be felt the next Century.

However, the King having summoned his Parliament to meet at Westminster, June
18. aforesaid, he told them, That at their earnest Entreaty, in March, 1623.
his Father had taken Arms for the recovery of the Palatinate, which, with the
Crown, was now devolved upon Himself: That the Supplies already given, held no
proportion with the Charge of the Enterprise: That the Eyes of all Europe were
upon him; and a Failure in this his first Attempt, would be a Blemish to his
futare Honor: And therefore desired them (if not for His, for their Own
Reputation) to deliver him fairly out of that War, wherewith themselves had
encumbered him, by an expeditious Supply. On which, the Commons gave Two
Subsidies, and the Clergy Three; and the Parliament (by reason of the Plague)
was adjourned to Oxford, to be held there Aug. 1. following; where the King
briefly acquaints them with his Wants, in order to the design's Expedition.
They, on the other hand, petition against Popish Recusants, and receive from
him a satisfactory Answer; but instead of a Supply, debate a Remonstrance of
Grievances to be first redressed, before a Supply given. So that not agreeing
who should be first trusted, the King or Themselves, the Parliament was
dissolved, and another summoned to meet at Westminster the next 6th. of
February. The Candlemas Day before which, the King was solemnly Crowned.

But here also the King met no better success than he had in his first: For the
Commons began, where they left at Oxford, with Religion and Grievances: And to
add to it, it fell unfortunately, that the Earl of Bristal being under
restraint, the King had sent him no Writ of Summons to the Parliament;
whereupon he petitions the Peers, That being a Peer of the Realm, he had not
received a Writ of Summons; and therefore prayed the Benefit of his Peerage;
and that if any Charge were against him, he might be Tried in Parliament. Upon
which (and the Request of the Peers) his Writ was sent him, with a Letter from
the Lord Keeper, That though his Majesty had awarded him the Writ, yet (...)
was his Pleasure that his Personal Attendance should be forborne. This Letter
the Earl sent to the Lords, with a second Petition, beseeching to be heard,
both as to his wrongful Restraint, and what he had to say Against the Duke of
Buckingham. This alarmed the Duke, whom the Commons already beheld with no good
Eye; and therefore to begin with him first, the Duke prevails with the King, to
command the Attorney General to Common him to the Lord's Bar, as a Delinquent;
where he appeared, May 1. and was by Mr. Attorney charged with Eleven Articles
of High Treason: But before they were read, the Earl said, My Lords, I am a
Freeman, and a Peer of the Realm unattainted: I have somewhat of high
Consequence to his Majesty's Service, and beseech your Lordships to give me
leave to speak. The Lords bade him go on. Then (said he) I accuse that Man, the
Duke of Buckingham. of High Treason. And immediately presented Twelve Articles
against him: After which, the Articles against the Earl being read, and himself
committed to the Black-Rod, the House ordered, That the King's Charge against
the Earl should be first proceeded on, before that of the Earl against the
Duke. And now the Ice thus broken, the Common (by eight of their own Members)
sent up Thirteen Articles of high Offenses and Misdemeanors against the Duke;
which he answered with so much modesty, that it much abated the Heat that many
had against him: And in regard the matters charged had been transcted in King
James's time, he claimed the Benefit of the Pardon of the Twenty first of King
James, and the present King's Coronation Pardon. On which, the Commons thus
d^^appointed, having prepared a Declaration of the same nature with their
Impeachment, the Parliament was dissolved by Commission, June 14. 1626. and no
Supply given: By which means, the Relief then setting forth for Rochel staid so
late in the Year, that they were dispersed with ill Weather, and forced to
return without doing any thing. The King of Denmark, to whom the King had sent
born Men and Moneys for the recovery of the Polatinate, was routed by Tilly
(the Emperor's General;) and without a present Supply, the Sound was in danger
to be lost, and the English East-land Trade and Staple at Hamburgh almost given
up for gone. And now what wonder if the King's extraordinary Wants, put him
upon extraordinary Courses? He borrows 120000 l. of the City of London, for
which they had Lands of 21000 l. yearly value assured to them; and 30000 l. of
the East India Company: And for the rest made use of Privy-Seals, Loans, as
such other ways as might enforce a less necessitated Prince to. However, that a
last Extremity might not run him beyond his Natural Inclination, he calls a
Parliament, which opened March 17. 1627. where he so pathetically laid before
them the cause of their meeting; which was, The Common Danger; a Supply
proportionable to it; The Exigence of Time; the just Desence of Friends and
Allies: And, lastly, closed all with his Hopes of their following that Advice,
of maintaining the Unity of the Spirit, in the Band of Peace; that the Commons
unanimously voted him Five Subsidies. On which, the King (by his Secretary) let
them know, He would deny them nothing of their Liberties, which any of his
Predecessors had granted.

But while the Bill for these Subsidies was preparing, the old Leven fermented
anew: Loans, Privy Seals, Billeting of Soldiers even in cases of Necessity, and
Martial Law for keeping them in order, was questioned, as contrary to Magna
Charta; which terminated in this, That the King gave his Royal Assent to that
so-much-talk'd of Petition of Right (wherein yet he granted no New Liberties,
but confirmed the Old) with this Declaration concerning the true Intent
thereof, That the Profession of both Houses in the hammering of the Petition,
was no ways to entrench upon his Prerogative, saying, They had neither
Intention nor Power to hurt it. Of which Intent and Meaning of his, in granting
the said Petition, he commanded all to take notice; Especially (said the King)
you my Lords the Judges; for to you only under Me, belongs the Interpretation
of the Laws: For none of the Houses of Parliament (joint or separate) whatever
New Doctrine may be raised, have any Power to make or declare a Law without My
Consent. And yet this did not so quiet some turbulent Heads of the Commons (who
would be satisfed with nothing but the Kingdom also) bet that they yet
remonstrated against several late Miscarriages in Government; and concluded
with the Duke of Buckingham, as the Common Grievance of the Kingdom, and tacked
it to the Bill of Subsidies; which the King took notice of; and withal hearing
they were preparing another, against Tonnage and Poundage, prorogued them from
June 26. to October. 20. 1628. Between which, and the said next Meeting, the Duke
was slain at Portsmouth (in the Thirty sixth Year of his Age) as he was fetting
fail for the Relief of Rochel, by one John Felton, a discontented Officer of
the last Year's Army; and the Parliament put of to the 20th. of January. At
what time the Debates running so high against the pretended increase of Popery
and Arminianism, and the levying Tonnage and Poundage, not yet granted by
Parliament. The King (by Warrant of the Privy Council) sent for several of the
Principal Authors of those Disorders; Four of which appearing; and refusing to
answer out of Parliament, what they had said and done in Parliament, they were
committed to the Tower, the Parliament dissolved, March to and such as had not
appeared, were apprehended, and committed to several other Pri^^ns; and an
Information preferred against them in the Star Chamber; to which they de^urr'd:
And in Michaelmas, 1629. brought their Habeas Corpus's in the King's Bench, and
^^ov'd to be Bailed; which the Judges allowed; with this, That they ought to
find Sureties for ^^e Good Behavior, in that it is a prevention of Damages to
the Commonwealth, and an Act of Government and Jurisdiction, not ^f Law. Which
being refused by them, they were remanded: And the King waving his Proceedings
in the Star Chamber, an Information was exhibited in the King's Bench against
Three of them, for Words spoken by them in ^he foregoing Parliament, falsely,
maliciously, and seditiously, as well against the King, the Peers of the Realm,
etc. as to raise a Tumult and Sedition, subvert the Government, and to the
intent all the King's Loving Subjects should withdraw their Affections from
Him. To this the Defendants pleaded, That forasmuch as the Offenses are
supposed to have been done in Parliament, they ought not to be punished in any
other Court but in Parliament; and demurred to the Jurisdiction of the Court:
Which after full Argument on both sides, was overruled by the Court, and a Day
given them to plead further; which they not doing, Judgment was given against
them upon a Nihil dicit, That they should be imprisoned during the King's
Pleasure; not to be de^iver'd 'till Security given in Court for the
Good-Behaviour, and acknowledgment of the Offense; and each of them
respectively final according to his Condition; it being further said by the
Judges, That Plowden in Queen Mary's time was fined for Words spoken in
Parliament against the Dignity of the Queen; And it was the Opinion of the
Justices i^ 8. Eliz. That Offenses committed in Parliament, are punishable out
of Parliament.

The Scots during this time were not idle at home, but blew those Coals of
Discontent among the People, which afterward fired the three Kingdoms; nor
wanted there an opportunity at present. The Lands of Cathedrals and Religious
Houses, with the Superiorities and Tithes belonging to them, had been by Act of
Parliament settled on the Crown; but by the Contrivance of Murray, and other
Regents during the Minority of King James, parcell'd among the Lords and Great
Men of the Kingdom, thereby to make a Party to themseves: And King Charles
coming to the Crown engaged in a War, and having no Aid from them, took a legal
course to resume them. On which those Occupants that well knew they had no
other Title than the Usurpation of their Ancestors, combine together to oppose
the King in every thing that should be offered in Parliament relating to
Church Affairs; and because Religion was the best Bait to hook in the People,
and conceal themselves, they center on that, and only wait the Occasion; which
fell thus: King James, from his first coming to the Crown of England (though he
failed in his Design of making the English and them into one People) had
proceeded so far (...) bringing the Kirk of Scotland to an Uniformity to the
Church of England, that he not only settled Episcopacy among them, but in the
General Assembly of Aberdeen, 1616. procured ^n Act for composing a Liturgy, or
Common Prayer; to be first presented to the King, and after his Approbation,
universally received through the Kingdom: And a Book of Canons, which also was
further improved by that other of Perth, 1618. and both ratified by an Act of
Parliament of that Kingdom: But what by reason of the Palatinate War, and his
own Death, it went no further in his time. And King Charles was so taken up at
home, that he was forced to deferr the finishing it 'till he came into
Scotland, where he was Crowned, May 18. 1632. And in a Parliament which fate
soon after, he caused an Act of Ratification of all that had been done by his
Father to be proposed, which (not without strong opposition) was carried by the
far greater Number: And after his return for England, he ordered the Dean of
his Chapel-Royal at Edinburgh, That the English Liturgy, with its usual
Ceremonies, should be used in his said Chapel. On this, the Presbyterian Scots
insinuate to the People, That this was a Design to subject the pure Kirk of
Scotland, to the Superstitions of the Church of England: And the Lords and
Gentry (who feared nothing more than that they should be forced to surrender)
possessed them, That Scotland was to be reduced into a Province, and Governed
by a Lord Lieutenant, as was Ireland. And th^doz'd into a Belief that their All
was at stake, what was there on which their Drivers might not run a heedless
Multitude.

And now the Dutch seeing the King's hand^ full, not only encroach'd upon the
Brit^^^ Seas, by their frequent Fishings, but began (...) dispute the Right of
the Dominion, in 1634 which the King being resolved to maintain and having
several Precedents for Ievying a Naval Aid upon the Subjects, by the sole
Anthority of the King, by a Writ under the Great Seal, when the Good and Safety
of the Kingdom is in danger; the King (by Letter under his Signet, Feb. 12.
1636.) consults the Judges in it; who all of them (Twelve in number) returned
their Opinions under their Hands, That theKing might do it; and in case of
refusal, compel the doing it by Law; And that the King is sole Judge, both of
the Danger, and when and how the same is to be prevented and avoided. However,
Two of them ( Hutton and Crook) afterward retracted what they had so formally
given under their Hands; which was the cause of no little Trouble in the
Kingdom, the Sound of which was not long ere it reached Scotland; albeit, upon
the solemn Arguments of all the Judges in the Exchequer-Chamber touching this
matter, Judgment was given for the King.

The King (as has been said) had ordered ^he English Liturgy to be used in his
Chapel-Royal at Edinburgh, which (at the Request of ^he Scots Bishops) having
been amended to their ^wn Model, was agreed to by the King, and ^ent back into
Scotland; and by the Bishops and Lords of the Council of that Kingdom, ^rder'd
to be read in the Great Church, July 23. 1637. Upon the very opening of which,
there ^rose such a Tumult of Stools and Cudgels thrown at the Dean (the
Reader's Head) that ^he Provost and Bailiffs of the City, had much ^do to
suppress. Nor fared it better in several other Churches, where (by the like
Command) it was also read; and from one thing to another ran to that height,
that Protestations being grown too strong for Proclamations, they enter into a
Confederacy, and bind it with a Covenant, for Maintenance of the King's Person
and Authority, (but how?) in Defense of the Gospel of Christ, and Liberties of
the Kingdom (of which themselves were Judges) and the mutual Defense of each
other, against all Persons whatsoever. Whereupon the Marquess Hamilton is fent
thither to compose the Differences; but with no effect: For (notwithstanding
all the King's Condescentions) they could neither be brought to acknowledge
they had parted from their Obedience, nor renounce their Covenant; than the
least Tittle of which, they declared they would fooner renounce their Baptism.
And thereupon took upon them a Power of convoking a General Assembly; in which,
they first deprived all the Bishops, and soon after abolished the Order it
self, seized the King's Castles, and ran into Arms; but finding the King upon
the Borders with a powerful Army, and themselves better prepared for a Treaty
than a Battle, a Pacification is made, July 17. 1639. And upon promise of
future Loyalty, the King pardons them.

But (alas!) the Core was not got out, and the Ulcer rather skinn'd over than
healed; for the King had scarce come to London, ere they broke all their
Articles, and apply to the King of France to favor their Proceedings, and give
them his Assistance. On which, the King calls another Parliament, which opened
April 13. 1640. and instead of taking the King's Business in hand, or the least
notice of this Insolence of the Scots, ran to that height against Ship Money,
Knighthoods, and the Actions of diverse Ministers of State, though done by the
King's Warrant, that they were dissolved May 5. following.

And now the Scots, who had formed an Intelligence with some of the English
Nobility and Gentry, and consequently assured of being favored by them when it
came to a Point, take Arms again; and publish a Declaration, Not to lay them
down, 'till Religion was settled in both Nations; and the Causers and Abettors
of their present Troubles (the Prelates and their Adherents, but more
particularly the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Earl of Strafford) were
brought to public Justice in Parliament, which also they desire may be called:
And thereupon march into England; where notwithstanding their giving out, That
they would take nothing without ready Money, they charge those adjacent Parts
with Eight hundred and fifty Pounds a Day. Nor had the King been so negligent
all this while, but that by the help of his better-affected Subjects, he met
them with an Army sufficient to have reduced them, had it come to a Battle; or
had he not been overpersuaded out of it, into a Treaty at Rippon, he had
probably prevented those ill Consequences that followed the slipping that
Opportunity. However, it ended in a patched Agreement for the present, and gave
the King the advantage of being assured of the Earl of Montross's Fidelity to
him, and readiness to serve him. On which, the King calls a Parliament, which
met at Westminster, November. 3. the same Year: And hitherto was but the
beginning of Sorrows.

The Parliament thus met, the King declared his earnest Desires for the Welfare
of the Kingdom; desired them (as he promised he would) to lay by all Prejudice,
and he would freely put himself upon the Love of his Subjects: Willed them to
consider of the best way for the Safety and Security of England: First, in
chasing out those Rebels who had invaded it; and next, for satisfaction of Just
Grievances. And as freely leaving it to them where to begin, closed with this,
That it should not be (...) Fault, if this were not a good and happy Parliament.

And truly, great might have been the Hopes concerning this Parliament, had
they not begun a Note too high, to make any Confort: For first, an Impeachment
was sent up from the Commons against the Earl of Strafford (who had been the
late General against the Scots) November. 12. On which, he was forthwith taken
into Custody, and committed to the Tower, November. 22. brought to his Trial,
March 22. which lasted 'till April 13. And lastly attainted by Act of
Parliament, and thereupon beheaded, May 12 following: And the same 10th. of May
that the King gave his Royal Assent to that Bill of Attainder, he gave the like
to another, That this Parliament should not be Dissolved, or Prorogued, but by
Act of Parliament.

And now having gotten this firmer footing, to what they had begun before, in
enlarging such as had been fined and imprisoned by the Star Chamber for
Libelling; voting Ship Money unlawful, and the Lord Keeper a Traitor;
impeaching the Archbishop of Canterbury, whom (after a Four Years imprisonment)
they beheaded by an Ordinance of Lords and Commons, at which Seven Lords only
were present; They proceed to Acts of Parliament for vacating Ship Money;
taking off the several Courts of Star Chamber, High Commission, the
Presidencies of Wales, and the North; the Bishops outed the House of Peers: And
having singled out the King, as it were, by Himself, they pray a Guard out of
the City of London, to be Commanded by the Earl of Essex: Which the King
refusing, he is so harassed with Tumults, that he is fore'd to remove from
London: And (which fell fortunately to their Game) a Rebellion in Ireland
having broke out the 23d. of October before, the King had given his Assent to
two Bills; the one, for the borrowing 400000 l. for the necessary Defense of
England and Ireland; the other (which brought in little less) for the
Encouragement of Adventurers for the reducing of Ireland. And so having gotten
such a Fund, they not long after further petition, That the Tower of London,
all other Forts, and the whole Militia of the Kingdom, might be put into such
hands, as should be recommended to him by both Houses. But being refused by the
King, they publish a Declaration,

That whatsoever They declare to be Law, ought not to be questioned by the
King:

That They, without the King, are Judges of the Public Good:

That the Sovereign Power resides in both Houses; and that the King ought to
have no Negative Voice:

That Treason cannot be committed against his Person, otherwise than as he is
entrusted with the Kingdom, and discharges that Trust; of which they are
Judges.

And thereupon raise an Army, and make the Earl of Essex General thereof, and
the Earl of Warwick Admiral at Sea, notwithstanding the King had appointed
another. On which, many of the House of Commons, and most of the Peers, repair
to the King at York; the King proclaims Essex and his Adherents Traitors, and
sets up his Standard at Nottingham, Aug. 20. 1642. In return of which, they (in
1643.) voted the Queen a Traiter, for helping her Husband with Ammunition, and
some English Forces out of Holland: And actually brought in an Army of Scots to
fight against the King; when yet they had made it an Article of High Treason
against the Earl of Strafford, for that he should have said at Council Board,
If his Majesty pleased to employ Forces, he had some in Ireland, which might
serve to reduce the Kingdom: The Question also at that time being touching
Scotland.

However, the King, without other Supplies than the voluntary Assistance of his
Loyal Nobility and Gentry, made a shift to bring the West, the North, and
several other parts of the Kingdom, under his Obedience; 'till at last,
oppressed by those inexhaustible Banks (as the Weekly Assessments, which for
the Year came to above 1700000 l. the Plate, ready Moneys, and Jewels borrowed
upon the Public Faith, which in London and Middlesex, came to upwards of Ten
Millions, besides the Profits of their new Excise, Sequestrations of King's,
Queen's, Prince's, Bishops, and Delinquents Lands; Tonnage, Poundage, and
whatsoever was in any wise due to the King) which, contrary to the known Laws,
they had raked to themselves; and not being able to recover that fatal Battle
of Naseby, June 14. 1645. He sunk by degrees; and at last threw himself upon
(his Countrymen) the Scots, who Delivered him up to the Parliament for 200000
l. and they kept Him under a Guard at Holmby.

The Parliament now in possession of the King, came to be divided into two
Parties, Presbyterian and Independent; and the Army, which was every of them a
Sect by it self, thinking they had as much Right to Him as the others, seize
Him, and bring Him to Hampton Court, about the middle of August, 1647. from
whence (without bettering His Condition) He escapes into the Isle of Wight, and
by Letter to the Parliament, desires a Personal Treaty at London: They, on the
other hand, vote Him 5000 l. for His present Accommodation, and send Him Four
Preliminary Bills to sign; but those so Unreasonable, that the King refusing
them, they (amongst other things) vote no more Addresses should be made to Him;
and the Army declares to stand by them in those Votes, and what shall be
further necessary for the prosecution thereof.

On this, several Parties in London, Wales, Essex, Kent, etc. rise for the
King; a part of the Navy go off to the Prince; and the Scots (under Duke
Hamilton) enter England. To suppress these, the Army is sent abroad, and
Cromwell makes against Hamilton, takes him Prisoner, and pursues the rest to
Edinburgh. During this absence of his, the Parliament revoke their Votes of Non
Addresses, and appoint Five Lords and Ten Commoners to treat with the King at
Newport in the Isle of Wight, with Honor, Freedom, and Safety. But (alas!)
they dodg'd so long about Trisles, that upon Cromwell's return before any thing
was concluded, the Army remonstrate, and require, That the King be brought to
Justice, as the Capital Cause of the Civil War: And thereupon having garbled
the Commons of Forty odd Members, and required that Ninety more, and all
others, that by their Votes, December. 5. before, had approved the King's
Concessions for a Peace, at the Isle of Wight, should be excluded the House,
'till they had entered their Dissents to those Votes; that Fagg-end of them
that was left, restored the Votes of Non-Addresses, voted a Charge of
High Treason against the King, and drew up an Ordinance for his Trial: Which
being rejected by the Lords, they made it an Act of their own; and on Saturday,
Jan. 20. 1648. brought Him before a Mock-High-Court of Justice, consisting of
one Bradshew their President, Cromwell, his Son-in-Law Ireton, and Seventy two
others, that appeared and sat; and with ignominious Expressions charged Him,
That as a Public Enemy of the Commonwealth, he had traitorously and
maliciously levied War against the present Parliament, and the People therein
represented. And after four Days, not allowing Him to be heard, unless he first
acknowledged the Authority of their Court, He was as Infamously sentenced to
have his Head severed from his Body; which was accordingly executed in the open
Street, before his Royal Palace of Whitehal, Jan. 30. 1648. in the Forty eighth
Year of his Age, and Twenty fourth of his Reign. And thus fell this oppressed
King; than whom, many have worn a Crown longer, no one left it with so much
Resolution.

His Queen and Relict was Henrietta Maria, as has been before said; by whom he
had Four Sons, and as many Daughters.

1. Charles Stuart, born, Christened, and died the same Day, March 18. 1628. 2.
Charles Stuart, Prince of Wales, born May 29. 1630. who after a Twelve Years
subversion of the Government, was restored, 1660. 3. James Stuart, Duke of
York, born October. 14. 1633. who (his Brother dying without Issue) succeeded him
in the Crown. 4. Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester, born July 8. 1640. died
after the Restoration, September. 13. 1660.
His Daughters: 1. Mary Stuart, born November. 4. 1631. married to William of
Nassau, Prince of Orange, May 2. 1641. by whom she had one Son, Henry William,
born nine Days after the Death of his Father; Crowned King of England, April
11. 1689. She died December. 24. 1660. 2. Elizabeth Stuart, born December. 28.
1635. died September. 8. 1650. 3. Anne Stuart, born March 17. 1636. died December.
8. 1640. 4. Henrietta Maria Stuart, born June 16. 1644 at Exeter, from whence
she was conveyed into France, and married to Philip Duke of Orleans, Brother to
Lewis XIV. the present King of France. She died 1670.


King Charles I. being thus dead, and that whatever it were of a Parliament
(according to the known Laws of England) thereby dissolved, they that had
killed the Father, knew they could not be secure 'till they had done as much by
the Son; and therefore immediately abolish the Monarchy, and turn the Name,
Style, Title, and Test of the King, into that of The Keepers of the Liberty of
England by Authority of Parliament; and make it High Treason to proclaim, or
any ways to promote Charles Stuart, commonly called Prince of Wales, or any
other Person to be King, etc. Yet this hindered not but that several printed
Declarations, in the Name of the Nobility, Judges, Gentry, and other the
Freemen of England, were scattered about London, thereby recognizing the
Prince's Hereditary Birthright to the Crown, etc. and their Resolutions of
defending it, to the last Man; Dated Feb. 1. in the First Year of the Reign of
King Charles II.

XXVI. The House of Lords was yet sitting, and sent to the Commons for a
Conference touching these matters; who instead of vouchsafing them an Answer
(by their Votes Feb. 6.) declare the Kingly Office to be unnecessary and
burdensome, and the Lords House dangerous and useless, and therefore to be
laid aside. Against these Proceedings the Lords protest; and the Army set a
Guard upon their House to prevent their assembling: And the Commons wholly took
it away, and their Privilege of Peerage with it, unless (being duly Qualified)
they shall be elected to sit in Parliament: And thereupon enacted themselves
The Supreme Authority of the Nation; A Commonwealth, and Free State, without
any King, or House of Lords: And committed the Executive Part of the Government
to A Council of State erected by them: of whom, Forty were principal Officers
in the Army. And having obliterated the very Prints of Monarchy, they proceeded
to the Sale of King's, Queen's, Prince's, Bishops, Dean and Chapters, and
Delinquents Lands; of which, themselves were (for the most part) Purchasers,
and that at easy Rates.

During this time, the Parliament of Scotland (that they might at least seem
not wanting to their Duty) recognize the King's undoubted Right of Succession
to the Crowns of these Kingdoms: But with this Clause in it, That he be not
admitted to the Exercise of it, 'till he had given Satisfaction to the Kingdom,
touching the Security of Religion, and the Unity betwixt the Kingdoms,
according to the National Covenant, and the Solemn League and Covenant.
Middleton, on the other hand, and several of the Scots Nobility, that were for
having the King admitted without previous Conditions, take Arms in the
Highlands; but were dispersed, before the Marquess of Montross who (with Men
and Arms) was just landed in the Isles of Orkney, could come up to join them:
However, this nothing daunted his Magnanimity, but that, with the Assistance of
some few that came in to him, he successfully made good the King's Interest
against the Covenanters, as he had formerly done his Royal Father's, in 1645.

And now they at home finding no great danger to be yet feared from Scotland,
cast an eye upon Ireland, where the Irish had generally submitted to the King's
Authority; and with the Assistance of several of the English that had served
his Father, had, in a manner reduced the whole Kingdom, excepting Dublin, and
the more remote parts of Ulster. And having laid a new Tax of 90000 l. a Month,
for the maintenance of the Army, they order Seven Regiments of Foot, Four of
Horse, and One of Dragoons, to be sent thither; and appoint Cromwell General,
and his Son Ireton Lieutenant General, for the Expedition; who with all the
haste that could be, transported their Forces, and landed in Dublin, Aug. 5.
1649. whence after a little refreshment, Cromwell marches them for Drogedah; and
after several repulses, takes it by storm, puts all to the sword, with out
respecting either Age, Sex, or Condition; and in less than a Year, subdues the
most part of the Kingdom to the Power of the New Commonwealth, and returns for
England, leaving Iretan to finish the rest; which he lived not to effect, but
died of the Plague at Limerick, and was succeeded by Ludiour.

While things went thus in Ireland, the Estates of Scotland had spun out a
lingering Treaty with the King at Breda; during which, the Kirk-Party having
surpised Mentrosa, defeated his Forces; and gotten himself betrayed into their
hands, they bring him to Edinburgh, hang him on a Gallows Thirty Foot high, and
quarter him, May 21. 1650. at what time yet his Resolution was so great, and
his Deportment so winning, that he won more from them by his manner of Dying,
than he could have vanquished in the Field by Arms. However, the Treaty took
effect at last; and the King lands in Scotland, and was proclaimed at
Edinburgh, July 15.

And now the Men at Westminster (better known by the Name of The Rump) think it
high time to look about them, and form an Army to be sent thither; Fairfax
should have commanded it, but (whether it were that the Covenant had bewitched
him, or Cromwell outwitted him) he declined the Charge; and Cromwell is made
Generalissimo; and with 16000 effective Men, enters Scotland, and has a Fleet
on the Coasts to attend his motions. Nor was it long ere he engaged the Scots
Army, and gave them (6000 Horse and Dragoons, and 15000 Foot) a Defeat at
Musleburgh, and a total Rout at Dunbar, September. 3. the same Year. On which,
they quit Edinburgh; and retiring to St. Johnsteun for new Recruits, Crown the
King at Scoon, Jan. 1. following.

Nor was Cromwell idle all this time, but having Edinburgh-Castle surrendered to
him, deseated a strong Party under the Command of Sir John Brown, and from one
step to another, at last takes St. Johnstoun: He was now about laying a Siege
to Sterlin-Castle, when the King, taking the Opportuity, marched his Army into
England by the way of Carliste, Aug. 6. 1651. where he was forthwith proclaimed
King, and met no opposition 'till he came to Warrington Bridge, where Lambert
got up with his Rear, and was worsted: But the King's wearied Army being not
able to reach London, he came to Worcester, Aug. 22. 1651. where probably he
might have expected Supplies, though few came in to him, saving Sir Cecil Howel
(Son of the Lord Howard of Escrick) who met him by the way with about 60 Horse
of his own raising; and the Earl of Darby, with 250 Foot, and about 70 Horse,
at Worcester; from whence, going into Lancashire with a considerable number of
Officers that had served King Charles I. he formed a reasonable Army; but ere
he could get back to the King, was intercepted, and with the slaughter of most
of them, taken Prisoner himself, and not long after beheaded, notwithstanding
the Quarter that had been given him.

On this, Cromwell surrounds Worcester, where (whether it were by Fate or
Treachery) he gave the King a total Rout, the said September. 3. was a Year, with
the slaughter of 2000, and 8000 taken Prisoners, besides 76 Cornets of Horse,
and 99 Colors of Foot, with the King's Standard. However, the King (leaving
Colonel Carlosse in his Rear) got off in the dark, to a House of the Earl of
Darby's, about Twenty five Miles from Worcester; where, by the Diligence of the
said Colonel, and the Fidelity of the Pendrils (Men of an ordinary Condition)
he was first preserved in an Oak, and from one Disguise to another, at last
safely landed in France, by a small Cole-Bark, of which one Tettershal was
Master, October. 22. following.

And now Cromwell returns triumphantly through London, with his Trophies, and
Prisoners driven before him; the former of which, he hung up in
Westminster Hall; and so dieted the latter in Tuttle-Fields, that there being
scarce 500 of them left alive, he sold them Slaves to the Barbados: But ere he
came out of Scotland, he had left the Chief Command of the English Forces
there, to General Monck, a Gentleman of an ancient Family in Devon, bred a
Soldier in the Low Country Wars, and who had honorably served King Charles I.
both in England and Ireland; but being taken Prisoner by the Parliament, and
under some straits in the Tower, Cromwell (who could not engage him to draw his
Sword for them in England) prevails yet with him to go with him into Scotland
against the Covenanters: Where having left him, Sterlin-Castle was in a short
time delivered to him, Dundee taken by storm, and the rest of the Kingdom
generally subdued or submitted to the New Lords at Westminster. On which, they
enacted the Union of the two Nations, and the Abolition of Monarchy in Scotland.

And yet ere matters came to this height, there fell an occasion of Quarrel
between the Dutch and them: Dorislaus (who drew the Charge against King Charles
I.) had been sent by them Ambassador to the Hague, where about a dozen
Cavaliers, headed by one Whitford, entered his Chamber as he was at Supper,
with some of the States, killed him, and got away: As not long after ran the
same fate Ascham, their Envoy at Madrid. However, this Infant-State thought it
not fit to make a downright Quarrel, 'till they could go by themselves, but
sent other Ambassadors ( St. John's and Strickland) to offer a League with the
United Provinces; which was entertained with so little forwardness, that within
a Month after the Battle of Worcester, they passed an Act against the importing
of Merchandise, in other than English Bottoms; disturbed their Fishing on the
English Coast, searched their Ships, as carrying Provisions to France, and made
some of them Prize. And now the Dutch send their Ambassadors to desire that
Friendship they before slighted; and the Rump, on the other hand, so stood on
Terms never likely to be granted, that it came to Blows; and the Dutch wisely
made the Flag the state of the Quarrel: Whereupon ensued several Naval
Engagements.

The first of these was May 17. 1652. where with 23 Ships against 42 of the
Dutch (of which one was taken, another sunk, and no one of the English so much
as disabled) Blake first asserted the Dominion, and carried it for that time;
and the States excused it, as a rash Action done by Trump, without their
Privity or Consent: But the Men at Westminster requiring Satisfaction for their
Charge and Damages, before they would hear further,

It came to a second, between Sir George Askew and De Ruyter, Aug. 16. and may
be called a Drawn-Battel, though the Dutch outnumber'd him by Ten Ships.

During this time, Blake had spoiled and dispersed their Herring-Fishing, and
taken Twelve Men of War that guarded them: On which followed a third
Engagement, October. 28. between Blake, Monck, and Deane joint Admirals for the
English, and Wit Wittens and De Ruyter for the Dutch; in which, the
Reer-Admiral of the Dutch was boarded and taken, Two others sunk, and One blown
up; besides Five of their West India Ships, and Six Streights-Men, which Blake
had taken in his coming up to it.

The fourth was November. 29. with 80 Dutch Ships, against 40 English, then
riding in the Downs, not expecting an Engagement; in which, Blake lost the
Garland taken, the Bonadventure burnt, and three others sunk, and by the favor
of the Night got off with the rest: On which, Trump stuck a Broom in his
Maintop.

The fifth was, Feb. 8. off of Portland, which lasted three Days, and in which
the English lost one Ship (The Sampson) and Blake received a desperate Wound on
his Hip, the Lameness of which he never recovered; but took Eleven of their
Ships of War, besides Thirty Merchantmen. On which, the Rump laid a Tax of
120000 l. a Month for the maintaining the War.

The sixth was June 2. 1653. at what time Trump coming upon our Coasts with 104
Ships of War, 12 Galleots, and 9 Fireships, was encountered by Monck and Deane,
with 100 of all sorts. The Fight was desperate, and lasted two Days; during
which, without any one Ship lost or disabled, and saving his Colleagne Deane
(who was taken off by the Waste by a Greatshot) but one Captain killed, Monck
sunk six of their best Ships, saw two others blown up, and took eleven (of
which three were Flag-ships) when at last Blake coming in with 18 fresh Ships,
the Dutch got off upon their Flatts.

The seventh and last Engagement was July 29. when Trump coming up with 95
Ships, was met by Monck (who by reason of Blake's Indisposition, now commanded
singly) with 106 Ships, and fought it 'till Night parted them: But by the next
Morning, Trump being re-enforc'd with 25 Ships by Wittens, and Monck having
given Orders through his Fleet, neither to give nor take Quarter 'till the
point were decided, it came to a more bloody Trial, in which (besides their
Admiral Van Trump slain) they lost Vice Admiral Evertson, and Thirty two others
sunk; himself, and four Captains, and twelve hundred common Men taken up after
the Fight, and made what sail they could for the Texel: Nor did Monck think it
fit to pursue them, as having bought the Victory with the loss of eight
Captains, and about five hundred common Men slain; five other Captains, and
seven thousand private Men wounded; and one Ship (The Oak) sunk.

While matters were thus at Sea, the Army, as well as the Nation, were become
so sick of our New Commonwealth on Shore, that they urge them to dissolve
themselves; which they not daring to refuse, nor yet willing to yield,
determine it to Nov. 5. 1654. but trifled so much time about Qualifications for
their Successors, that Cromwell (not meaning to stay so long, and the Army
declaring against them, as a Party of Carnal Men, and not to be trusted with
the Choice of their Representatives) turned them out of the House, and set a
Guard upon it, April 23. 1653.

This done, Cromwell and his Officers constitute A Council of State, made up of
themselves and their Confederates of the late House, and place the Supreme
Authority in them, 'till a Representative could be chosen; which not long after
was patched together of an hundred forty two known Persons (as the Cant was)
Men fearing God, and of approved Integrity; but so ridiculous as to Man, that
it was thought Cromwell got them together to no other end, than to bring
Parliaments into contempt.

However, they met July 4. and having declared themselves a Parliament, the
Council of State resign their Supremacy to them; and they appoint a New Council
of State, consisting of Cromwell and his Officers, with Power to transact all
Public Affairs, treat with Ambassadors, etc. But in that five Months time
that they sat, they had so unhinged every thing, and done nothing, but to the
worse, that even their Masters who brought them together, were ashamed of them;
and most of themselves so sensible of it, that their Speaker Rous, with the
Mace before him, and a major part of them following him, came to Whitehall, and
surrendered to Cromwell the Instrument he had delivered to them at their first
sitting; and in four Days after, the Officers of the Army having formed a New
Instrument of Government, they entreat him to accept it, under the Name of Lord
Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland; which at first
he seemingly refused, 'till at last persuaded into what he had so long
designed, he submits to the Exigence of Time and Affairs, and was the same
Afternoon, viz. December. 16. 1653. accordingly inaugurated in Westminster Hall.

The Dutch by this time had made a truer Estimate of the English Force, than
they did when they began the War; and having underhand tampered with Cromwell
for a Peace, and finding they might have easier Terms from him than the Rump
would even hear of, they sent over Ambassadors to him: Nor was he so well
settled as to refuse a fair Proffer, and Money to boot; whereupon a Peace was
concluded between them, and proclaimed April 5. 1654. in which the King of
Denmark was included: And near the same time he made another, with Queen
Christina of Sweden. Spain also, France, and Portugal, seek his Friendship; but
Spain could not obtain it: And so this first jobb being over, he returned Monck
back into Scotland, (though with all his Art he could never get him back again)
and sent his second Son Henry, Lord Deputy into Ireland, and called a
Parliament, which met September. 3. 1654.

Nor had they searce taken their Seats, ere they fell to disputing the Power by
which they were called; whereupon a Recognition of the Government, as it was
then settled in a single Person, was sent them to subscribe, with an Inhibition
to any one of their entering the House 'till he had done it: In which, though
most of them complied, the whole was dissolved, within the first five Months;
which was contrary to the said New Instrument.

In 1655. he made an attempt upon Hispaniola, but miscarried in it, and took
Jamaica with little or no opposition: And to cover, at least secure, against
the Slurr at home, he decimated all the Royalists, i. e. took a Tenth part of
their Estates, and set up Eleven Major-Generals to Tax it, and keep them in awe.

The Year following he called another Parliament, which met September. 3. and
they (perhaps) guessing what he would be at, present him an Humble Petition and
Advice, to take the Title of KING; which he refused twice; but being pressed to
a more positive Answer, he had, the very Morning that he made the Third Denial,
resolved to accept it: But whatever it was that made him change his Mind, does
not appear; though, if his Secretary Thurloe may be believed, it was not that
he feared the General Officers, for there were New Commissions actually drawn
for others, who had accepted their Commands: Where upon the Word King, in the
said Petition and Advice, was expunged, and he in a more solemn manner invested
with all the Regal Ornaments (the Crown only excepted) June 26. 1657. and
proclaimed by the Name of Oliver Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England,
Scotland, and Ireland. After which, the Parliament being adjourned to Jan. 20.
he in the mean time (in Imitation of the old Constitution) created a New House
of Lords, by the Name of The Other House: Of which the Commons taking no more
notice than to ridicule it, and then falling to dispute the Government, he
thought it high time to put an end to their sitting, and dissolved them. Not
long after which, having escaped several Attempts, of as well Commonwealths
Men, Fifth-Monarchy-Men, as Royalists, he at last (to the wonder of Mankind)
died in his Bed, on his twice-Auspicious Third of September, 1658. having
(according to the Power given him by the said Humble Petition and Advice) first
declared his eldest Son Richard his Successor; who, contrary to the expectation
of Fleetwood and Lambert (whom Cromwell had severally cajoled with the Promise
of the Succession) was the next Morning solemnly proclaimed Lord Protector,
etc. But he lasted not above three Quarters of a Year; and in him ended the
Protectorship.

And yet before we come to the Restoration, it may not be amiss to remark the
several Turns of Government, that from the 30th. of January, 1648. befell the
Nation, 'till that happened: For, 1. The Monarchy was subverted, and turned to
a Republic, under the Name of The Keepers of the Liberty of England by
Authority of Parliament, or for brevity sake The Rump; and they lasted 'till
April, 1653. 2. Cromwell turned them out, and placed the Supreme Power in A
Council of State constituted by himself; and they held it 'till July the same
Year. 3. From them, he turned it into the hands of his Men of Integrity, and
made them a Parliament; which, in contempt of one of its Members, was called
Praise God Barebone's Parliament; and they held it 'till December the same
Year. 4. From that time it was in the hands of Cromwell, with the Title of Lord
Protector, 'till September, 1658. 5. After him, his Son Richard had it, as
Successor to his Father, 'till he was turned out by the Army in April, 1659.
and then for a Fortnight together it lay nowhere. 6. The May following, the
Rump got it again, and held it 'till they were turned out by Lambert, the same
Year: And here also for some time together it lay nowhere, 'till, 7. The
Council of Officers erected A Committee of Safety, with like Supremacy; and
they held it, 'till General Monck having declared for restoring the Rump,
Lambert marched against him; but being deserted by his Army, Fleetwood writes
to the Speaker Lenthal, to desire him, and the rest of the Members, to return
to the Exercise of their Trust: And the General, on the other hand, having put
his, into such hands as favored his Design, marched toward London. 8. On
this, the Rump resumes the Government, December. 26. and by a Letter of Thanks to
Monck, acknowledge the Restitution to their Authority, was to be acknowledged
to his Fidelity, Case, and Courage. And yet he had not been long in Town, ere
they began to grow jealous of him; and therefore for fear he might join with
the City, who had now declared they would pay no more Taxes 'till the
Parliament were filled up, they sent him into the City to break down their
Gate, etc. which he accordingly did, returned his Army to their Quarters about
Westminster, and received the Thanks of the House. Yet this did not so satisfy
the Jealousy of a Commonwealth, but that they pressed the Oath of Abjaration
of the Royal Family to him, which he took time to consider of: But the next
Morning marched his Army into the City, and joined with them for having the
House filled up. 9. On this, the Members that had been secluded the House in
1648. were restored Feb. 21. 1659. and they having constituted General Monck,
Captain General of all the Forces in the Three Kingdoms, annulled the former
Council of State, and appointed another, and abrogated the Engagement, and Oath
of Abjuration; dissolved themselves, March 17. But before their rising, sent
out Writs for New Elections to meet April 25. 1660. In the mean time, the
Rumpers ply the General with their last effort, and proffer him the Supreme
Command of the Kingdoms, as a single Person: Which he answered to this purpose;
That for that matter, it was submitted to the coming-Parliament; nor should it
be said of him, That ^e bad run foul of that Rock, on which Cromwell ^ad so
lately split himself.


The Day being come, the Lords as well as ^he Commons, met in their respective
Houses, when having each of them received a Letter from his Majesty, with a
Declaration enclosed, the Lords resolved by Vote, That they declare, That
according to the ancient and fundamental Constitution of this Kingdom, the
Government is, and ought to be by King, Lords, and Commons: To which the
Commons agreed; and each of them dispatched their several Answers ^o the said
Letters, superscribed, To the King's most Excellent Majesty. And having caused
Him to be solemnly proclaimed, May 8. they sent six Lords, and twelve of the
Commons, to attend his Majesty, and desire his return to the Exercise of his
Kingly Office. Which ^he accordingly did, and landed at Dover the 25th. and
rode through London to Whitebal the 29th. being his Birth Day, and Thirtieth
Year of his Age.

Thus by the Conduct of one Man, with a raw Army of not above Six Thousand, was
the Monarchy delivered from a Twelve Years Usurpation, defended by at least
Sixty Thousand Veterans, strengthened with most of the Alliances of Europe, and
(which adds to ^it) without Blood; a Stratagem (perhaps) not yet extant in
History. He was the Great Grandson of Sir Thomas Monck of Potheridge, in the
County of Devon, by Frances, one of the Daughters and Coheirs of Arthur
Plantegenet, Viscount Lisle, of whom before; in memory of which, the King
created him Duke of Albemarle, Earl of Torrington, Baron Monck of Potheridge,
Beauchamp, and Teyes.

And so being come to our own Times, is may seem needless to add further,
saving that the King was Crowned April 23. 1661. and died of an Apoplexy, Feb.
6. 1684. His only Wife and Relict, was Catharine, Daughter of John IV. King of
Portugal, now living, by whom he had no Issue.

XXVII. To King Charles II. succeeded his Brother, James Duke of York, etc. who
upon his first coming to the Crown, professed Himself a Catholic; with this
Displeasure nevertheless, That he could not alter the Religion as it was by Law
established. He, together with his Queen, were Crowned April 23. 1685. Nor was
that scarce over, when Two Rebellions, the one in Scotland, the other in the
West of England, broke out upon him, and were defeated. In the Year 1688. he
published A Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, so far as it disturbed not
the Peace of the Kingdom: Which so heated the People (who yet had all along
CONTENDED for it) that having sent his Queen, and young SON into France, he
followed Them not long after. His first Wife was Anne, Daughter of Sir Edward
Hide, Earl of Clarendon, etc. Lord Chancellor of England, who died before he
came to the Crown; by whom he had

Four Sons: 1. Charles Stuart, Duke of Cambridge; born October. 22. 1660. died
May 5. 1661. 2. James Stuart, Duke of Cambridge; born July 12. 1663. died June
20. 1667. 3. Charles Stuart, Duke of Kendal; born July 4. 1666. died May 22.
1667. 4. Edgar, Duke of Cambridge; born Sept 14. 1667. died June 8. 1671.


And as many Daughters: 1. Marie; born April 30. 1662. married to William Henry
Prince of Orange, who were both Crowned King and Queen April 11. 1689. The
Executive Power in Him. 2. Anne; born Feb. 6. 1664. married to Prince George of
Denmark, August 7. 1683. 3. Henrietta; born January 13. 1668. died Nov. 15.
1669. 4. Catharine; born Feb. 9. 1670. died December. 5. 1671.


His Second Wife, Mary d'Este, Daughter of Alphonso d'Este III. Duke of Modena;
Crowned as before; and had Issue by her,

Two Daughters: 1. Catharine; born November. 7. 1674. died October. 3. 1675. 2.
Isabel; born Aug. 28. 1676. lived not long.


AND --

1. Charles, Duke of Cambridge; born Nov. 7. 1667. died December. 12. following.
etc.

Of the Augmentations of the Family of ENGLAND.
. VIII. ITS First was, when William the Conqueror joined Normandy to the Crown
of England, 1066. Henry II. Conquered Ireland, and in like manner united it,
1172. Edward I. Wales, 1283. Edward II. in Right of his Wife Isabel, Daughter
of Philip the Fair, King of France, brought in Aquitain and Ponticu: And in the
same Right, Edward III. took upon him the Title of King of France; and was the
first of the English Kings that Quartered the Arms thereof. Henry V. Conquered
most of the Kingdom. Henry VI. was Crowned King of France in Paris, 1432. James
VI. King of Scotland, made an Accesion of that Crown to England, 1603. and
first Quartered the Arms of England and Ireland, ^ith those of Scotland.

Beside, which, the English have superadded several Plantations in America; as
Virginia, 1584. the Bermudaes, 1591. Barbados, Nowingland, 1606. Maryland,
about 1632. Jamaica, 1656. Besides Nova Scotia, one half of (...)
Christopher's, Hudson's Bay, Now-York, Carclina, Pensylvania. Several other
Places of Trade also in the East-India's; and Tangier in Africa, 1668. but
demolished in -- as not worth the charge (...) keeping it.

Of its Decreasings.
. IX. THe greatest Loss it received has been from France; for whereas about the
Year 1432. what by Hereditary Right, what by Marriages, what by Conquest and
Submission of the People, it had in a manner the whole Kingdom. It lost in
1450. not only its New Acquests, but Hereditary Provinces to Charles VII. King
of France, who by means of the Civil Wars between the Houses of York and
Lancaster, so forced the English out of France, that they retained only
Callice, which also was lost by Queen Mary, 1558. However, it yet continues the
Title and Arms of France; other than which, it makes no Pretensions; nor have
those been set on foot, for near 150 Years last past.

CHAP. IV. Of the House of Denmark.
. I. THere is nothing more certain, than that the Danes have had their peculiar
Kings for many Ages past, whom Historians generally distinguish by eight
Periods; See Pontanus's Danish History, lib. 7. and Beckman's Civil History, c.
5 Sect. 6. The Seventh of these Periods, is that of the Suenonidae, or
English-Danes, so called from Sueno (or Swain-Ethrick.) whose Ancestors,
according to Saxo, the Grammarian, in the 10th. Book of his Danish History, had
a Bear for their first Progenitors: For he says, That Ulso, who was Sueno's
Father, had one Ursus, or Biorno, for his Grandfather, begot by the monstrous
Copulation of a Wild Beast, with a young Virgin. About the Year 1346. Woldemar
the Third, descended of this Family was King of Denmark, who, after a Peace
made with Schmeek Magnus, King of Sueden, brought the Country of Scandinavia
under his Jurisdiction, in the Year 1360. afterward in 1363. he obtained
Gotland also, upon another Peace then concluded with King Albert. He had also
Wars with the Hans-Town, and dyed, 1375. leaving only a Daughter, named
Margaret, whom he gave in Marriage to Haquin, second Son of Erick, King of
Sweden, by whom she had Issue Olaus, the Sixth; who, upon his Father Haquin's
Decease (which happened in 1380.) succeeded both to Denmark and Sweden, as well
as Norway, but dyed an untimely Death seven Years after, viz. 1387. Whereupon
the Government, by the consent of the Nobility of Denmark and Norway, returned
to Queen Margaret; but the Swedes elected Albertus, Duke of Mecklenburgh, to be
their King; with whom Queen Margaret was soon engaged in a War, being provoked
thereunto by him, wherein proving Victorious, and taking him Prisoner, caused
her self to be elected Queen, An. 1396. She adopted for her Successor, Prince
Erick, Son of Uratislaus, Duke of Pomerania, and Grandson of her Sister
Ingeburg, Wife of Henry the Second, Duke of Mecklenburg, by her Daughter Mary,
who, at a Convention of the States, held at Calmar in 1397. was elected King of
the Three Northern Crowns, an Hereditary Union being then made, by which it was
Enacted, that for the future, the Three Northern Kingdoms should be Governed by
one and the same Scepter. As for Queen Margaret, the Danish Semiramis, (for so
she is often styled) she departed this Life in the Year, 1412. After which King
Erick, not so well acquainted with the Arts of Governing, as she had been, soon
drew upon himself the Odium of his People; insomuch, that in the Year 1439. he
was deposed by 'em, and had his Crowns taken from him, chiefly on pretense that
he had not observed his Promises, nor kept his Coronation Oath, but rather on
the contrary, opposed a Free Election, by naming Bogislaus Duke of Pomerania to
succeed him. In his room they substituted Prince Christopher, his Sister
Sophia's Son, by her Husband John Count Palatine of the Rhine, and Duke of
Bavaria; which Christopher died without Issue, 1448. notwithstanding he had
Married Dorothy, Daughter of John Marquess of Brandenburg; and by this means
put an end to the ancient Royal Family of Denmark.

. II. In this state of Affairs, they Elected Adolph, Earl of Holstein to be
King, but he modestly declined the Crown, when offered, either out of a
consideration of the Infirmity of his great Age, or else doubtful what might be
the success of the Danish Affairs: But withal, earnestly recommended to their
choice, Christian Count Oldenburg, his Sister's Son; who was thereupon Elected
and Crowned King, by the unanimous consent of all the Nobility, as we shall
show more at large in the following. 'Twill here be expected, we should give
some account of the Original of this Family of Oldenburg; but indeed, it is so
hid in the Clouds (if we may so say) by reason of its great Antiquity, that
little of certainty can be picked out. For although it be the common Tradition,
that it is derived from the Posterity of Witikin the Saxon, and namely, from
the Counts of Ringelheim, yet Reinerus, Renneccius, and others, think it most
advisable to leave things as they find 'em, and affirm nothing in so doubtful a
matter. However they say, that toward the end of the Tenth Century, one Otho
was Earl of Oldenburg; who had a certain wonderful Horn given him by a Spirit
or Apparition, which is to be seen to this day in the Castle of Oldenburg; and
that he was Father of John, Conrade and Rixa: That John begat Huno the
Glorious, Father of Frederick, who, in the end, became a Monk, and left a Will,
by which he made his Cozen Elimar his Heir, (which Elimar was Son to his great
Aunt Rixa, by her Husband Hoio, Lord of Friezland in Pottenburg and Memmenburg,
whose Pedigree they also derive from the abovenamed Witikin) That Elimar, by
Virtue of this Will, possessed himself of the Earldom, notwithstanding all the
opposition of Milo Count Alvensleb, Grandson of the abovenamed Conrade, and
so became the first Count of Oldenburg, of his Line. Amongst this Princess's
Children, we find mention made of Elimar the Second, who begat Christian the
Warlike, Father of Maurice, by his Wife Cunigund, Countess of Locken; which
Maurice, after manifest proofs of his Courage on all occasions, retired to a
Monastery; and was succeeded in the County by his Son, Christian the Second.

Christian the Second had Issue, 1. John the First, of whom by and by again. 2.
Otho the Third, who by his Charter erected the Town of Delmenhorstan into a
City, and Founded the Cathedral there, An. 1265. 3. Theodorick (or Diderick)
Elected Grand Master of the Teutonick Order in Prussia, An. 1335. in the 80th.
Year of his Age.


John, the Eldest of these Three, had two Sons.

I. Christian the Third, who, in the Division of his Father's Inheritance,
'twixt him and his Brother, had the County of Delmenherstan for his Patrimony,
in which he was succeeded by his Son Christian, whose Granddaughter Adelheid,
by his Son Otho the Simple, was married to Theodorick (or Diderick) the happy
Earl of Oldenburg. II. John the Second, who, in the division aforesaid, had the
County of Oldenburg settled on him, and was Father of Conrade, by his Wife
Margaret, Countess of Lip. Conrade begat Christian the Fifth, Canon of
Cologne, who, seeing his Brother Maurice like to die with Issue Male, quitted
his Canonry, and married Agnes of Hohenstein, by whom he had 1. Christian the
Sixth, taken and Imprisoned by the Inhabitants of Bremen, and not dismissed but
on very hard terms; he afterward died without Issue. And, 2. Theodorick (or
Diderick) the Happy, who, by a Marriage with his Cozen Adelheid, Heiress of
Delmenhorst, reunited the two Counties: After her Decease he took a Second
Wife, namely, Hedewig, Sister of Adolph, Earl of Holstein, who bore him three
Sons; Christianus the First, born 1425. Maurice and Gerrard.

. III. Of these, Christian the First, as has been already observed in the
beginning of the last. was elected King of Denmark and Norway, in the Year
1448. and ten Years after, of Sweden also; though he lost that Kingdom again in a
few Years after. He purchased the County of Holstein for 34000. and restored
that of Sleswick to the Crown. He likewise obtained of the Emperor Frederick
the Third, the Investiture of the Duchy of Holstein; and opened an University
at Copenhagen on the first of June 1479. His Queen was Dorothy, the Relict of
his Predecessor King Christopher, by whom he had this following Issue: 1.
Margaret, given in Marriage to James the Third, King of Scotland, together with
the Isles of Orkney, lying in the Northern Seas, as security for her Dowry,
which was to be Fifty Thousand Florins. 2. John, born 1455. And, 3. Frederick,
of whom more in the next Sect.


John succeeded his Father in the Throne, and was Crowned King of Denmark and
Norway, in the Year, 1483. About five or six Years after he reduced Sweden, and
was Crowned there also. He once more separated the Duchy of Holstein and
Sleswick from the Crown, and divided them 'twixt him and his Brother Frederick.
In 1500 he suffered a great defeat from the Rebellious Inhabitants of
Dietmarsh; and was also outed by the Swedes some time after. In the Year 1513.
he departed this Life of a Fever, which he took by a fall from his Horse in the
Water, leaving Issue by Queen Christina, Daughter of Ernestus, Elector of Sax.
only one Son and a Daughter, namely, I. Elizabeth, born 1455. Married to
Joachim the First, Elector of Brandenburgh, 1502. Deceased a Widow, 1555. II.
Christianus the Second, born 1481. The undutiful Son of a most Indulgent
Father, whose Curse at length, he drew upon his Head. In his Father's
Lifetime, he was elected to succeed him in his Kingdoms of Denmark, Norway,
and Sweden. His Paramour was the fair Columbula, whom he kept with a certain
Old Woman, named Sigberta, wholly enslaving himself to her Will. He refused the
Proposals of a Reconciliation with his Uncle Frederick, in the Year 1519. and
making an Expedition into Sweden, seized on the Capital City of Stockholm;
caused himself to be Crowned King, and was Author of the bloody Slaughter
there. Afterward he was Outed of all his Kingdoms, and forced to fly into the
Low Countries; from whence returning, he was seized and confined by his
Subjects, and at length ended his Days in 1559. in the Seventy Eighth Year of
his Age. The Partner of his Bed and Fortunes was Isabella, Sister to the
Emperor Charles the Fifth, by whom he had only two Daughters, that outlived
him; his Son John dying in the Hungarian Service, against the Turks, An. 1532.
The Daughters names were, 1. Dorothy, born 1515, married to Frederick the
Second, Elector Palatine, Deceased 1580. And, 2. Christina, born 1573 whose
first Husband was Francis Storza, Duke of Milan, and after his Decease, Francis
Duke of Lorrain. She dyed 1590.



. IV. We must now look back to Frederick the First, elected King of Donmark and
Norway, in the Year 1523. by the unanimous consent of the Nobility, upon their
rejecting King Christian. This Prince abrogated the Act of Hereditary Union of
the Three Northern Cowns, in the Year 1524. at a Convention of the States then
held at Malmugen. He made Profession of the Reformed Religion, and after he had
thrown out the Monks in 1527. introduced the same into his Countries. He was
twice married; his first Wife being Anne, Daughter of John Cicero, Elector of
Brandenburg, who dyed 1521. And his second, Sophia, Daugher of Bog^slans the
Tenth, Duke of Pemeranta, Deceased 1568. By these he had Issue.

I. Dorothy, born 1494. Married to Albert, Duke of Prussia, Deceased 1547. II.
Christianus the Third, born 1503. of whom more in the next Sect. III. John,
Surnamed The Elder, born 1521. Deceased without Issue 1580. IV. Elizabeth,
Married in 1542. to Magnus, and after his Decease, in 1556. to Ulrick. Dukes of
Meckleburg; she dyed 1586. V. Anne, Deceased of the Plague. VI. Dorothy,
Married to Christopher, Duke of Meckelburg in 1573. Deceased 1575. VII. Adolph
the First, Duke of Sleswick, born 1526. of whom, more hereafter, in the Ducal
Line of Sleswick. VIII. Frederick, Bishop of Hildesheim, born 1529. Deceased
Oct. the 27th. 1556.
. V. Of these, Christian the Third succeeded to the Throne, about the Year
1537. the beginning of whose Reign was perplexed with many Difficulties; all
which he Mastered in the end. He established the Reformed Religion throughout
his Dominions, and caused the Holy Bible to be Translated into the Daniso
Tongue; and above all, made it his chiefest care to enjoy a peaceable and quiet
Reign. He departed this Life 15^^. leaving behind him the Character and Example
of a Devout, Peaceable, and Excellent Prince. By his second Marriage, which was
with Dorothy, Daughter of Magnus, Duke of Sax-Lawenburg, he had live Children;
the Daughters being Anne and Dorothy; the first Married to Augustus, Elector of
Saxony; the other to Ulrick Duke of Lunenburg. The Sons names were, 1. Magnus,
Bishop of Derpte, in Livonia, who, with the assistance of the Russe, attempted,
but in vain, the Reduction of Livonta. He departed this Life in Poland, An.
1585. leaving only a Daughter, who being carried into Muscovy, by her Mother,
who was John Basilides, the Cza^'s Daughter, was there Educated and Married to
Albert Janowitz, Lord High Chancellor of that Country. 2. John the Second,
Progenitor of the Ducal Line of Holstein, of whom more in the Eleventh Section.
And, 3. Frederick the Second, Eldest of the Three, though last named, who
succeeded to the Throne after his Father's Decease, in the Year 1559. This
Prince gave the Isle of hay to Tycho Brahe, that he might the better be at
leisure to make his Astronomical Observations. He had great Wars with the
Swede, till the Year 1570. In 1574. he began to build Cromenburg; and two Years
after opened an University at Sora. He likewise highly adorned and advanced the
Order of the Elephant. His Queen was the Princess Sophia of Meckeburg. By whom
he had these following Sons and Daughters. 1. Elizabeth, born 1573. Married to
Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick, 1590. Deceased 1627. 2. Anne, born 1574. given
in Marriage to James King of Scotland, and afterward of Great Britain, on the
20th. of Aug. 1590. Deceased March the 2d 1618. 3. Augusta, born 1580. Married
to Adolph, Duke of Holstein Gottorp, Deceased 1629. 4. Hedewig, born 1581. and
Married Christianus the Second, Elector of Saxony; she departed this Life 1602.



The Sons were, 1. Christian the Fourth, born 1577. 2. Ulrick, Bishop of
Sleswick, Deceased 1624. And 3. John, born 1583. who went into Muscovy, where,
in hopes of succeeding to that Crown, he Married the Princess Alexia, but being
seized by an Apoplexy, dyed without Issue, An. 1602.


Christian the Fourth, was elected King, at the Age of Thirteen, his Father
being yet living, who having his thoughts on War, though in time of Peace, gave
Orders for the raising several Fine Fortifications; namely, Christianstadt in
Schonen, Christiania in Norway, Christianople in Bleking, Gluckstadt upon the
Elbe, and Christian-Presk in Holstein. He was engaged in several great Wars; as
first, with the Swede, then with Count Schaumburg; a second time with the Swede
in 1611. followed by a Peace in 1613. Then with the Emperor in 1625. on behalf
of the Circle of the Lower-Saxony, by whose Forces he was defeated in a Battle
fought not far from Lutheram Bohrenburg; then again with the Swede in 1643, at
which time he had various Success, till at length a Peace was concluded with
'em at the Town of Bremsbroe, in the Year 1648. In 1618. he set out a Fleet for
the Isle of Zeilan in the East Indies, the first that ever sailed from Denmark
for those Parts, which returned Freighted with Spice. The Partner of his Bed
and Fortunes was Anne Catharine, Daughter of Joachim Frederick Elector of
Brandenburg, by whom he had Issue, 1. Christian, born 1603. elected to succeed
him, but dyed in the Prime of his Age, An. 1647. 2. Frederick, of whom more in

Denmark. 2. Anna Sophia, born 1647. and married in 1666. to John George the

Of the Augmentation of the Regal Family.
. VIII. AFter it had been enacted in the Reign of Queen Margaret, that for the
future, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, should be Governed by the same Prince;
Christianus the First, Earl of Oldenburg, became possessed of these Three
Kingdoms, by Right of Election; that is to say, first of Denmark, to which
appertained Jutlandt, Zelandt, Tuyen, Schonen, Halland, Bleking, Temeren,
Bornholm, Alsen, Lang-Landt, Lalandt, Hyen, etc. secondly ^f Norway, and its
Dependencies, to which ^^so belonged the Isles of Orkney and Iseland; ^^irdly
of Sweden, together with both the Sothlands, Lapland, Finland, and other its
appurtenances. In the Year 1459. Christianus he First bought the Earldom (or
County) of Holstein, for three and thirty Thousand Florins. (...) 1474. the
County of Holstein was erected into a Duchy of the sacred Roman Empire. Upon
the Death of Adolph, Duke of Sleswick, that Duchy, as held in Fee, fell to the
Crown. Christian the Third, bought the Isle of Oesel, and Lordship of Auron in
Livonia, where likewise he had the City of Ravel, delivered up ^o him, by
Maurice Wrangel, Bishop thereof. ^n the Year 1676. Anthony Gunther, the last
Earl of Oldenburg, dying without Issue, the present King, by right of
Inheritance, became possessed of the Counties of Oldenburg and Del^enborst; as
also the Lordship of Kniphuse. In the Year 1682. there was an accession to this
Lrown, of the Lordship of Jevern, by the Grant of the French King. Last of all,
Christian Adolph, Duke of Holstein in Sunderburg was necessitated to part with
his Sovereignty to the present King.

Of its Decrease.
. IX. THe first, and indeed the greatest diminution suffered by the Royal
Family of Denmark, was in the Year 1469. at which time the Princess Margaret
was given in Marriage to James the Third, King of Scotland, together with the
Isles of Orkney and Hetland, as security for her Portion, which was fifty
thousand Florins of the Rhine. In 1524 the Kingdom of Sweden was torn from it.
In 1544. at a division then made of Lands in the Duchy of Holstein, 'twixt
King Christian the Third, and his Brother Adolph, the King parted with the
Governments of Trictou, Oldenburg, and Neustadt, together with the Monastries
of Cismar and Rheinbeck; as also the whole Duchy of Sleswick, though this last
was to be held by Adolph and his Posterity, only as a Fife of the Crown. In
1564. at another division of Lands then made, 'twixt King Frederick the Second,
and his Brother John, the latter obtained the Isles of Alsen and Arroe; as also
the Praefectures or Governments of Ploen, Rheinfeld, and Arensburg, with their
Dependencies. About the Year 1585. the then King of Denmark lost Oesel, as also
whatever else he held in Liffland. In 1658. Halland, the Isle of Bornholm.
Schonen, and Bleking, were set over to the Swede by the fifth Article of the
Peace of Roschild: As was also the Government of Babuys in Norway, with the
City and Castle thereof, together with the Government of Drontheam, and
whatever else the Danes had been hitherto possessed of in the Isle of Rugen;
though afterward by the Articles of Peace concluded on in the Year 1660.
Drontheam and Bornhelm were again surrendered to the Danes. In 1689. Christian
the present King of Denmark, restored the Duchy of Sleswick to Christian
Albert the present Duke, together with the absolute and independent Sovereignty
thereof. The same Year, in the Month of Aug. the Lordship of Jevern by an
amicable agreement, was surrendered to the Prince of Anhalt-Servesten.

Of the Pretensions of this House.
. X. THe Claims of the Kings of Denmark, are to the City of Hamburg, as built

Of the Ducal Line of Sleswick.
. XVI. It Is now time to treat of the Ducal Line of Sleswick, the Author whereof
was Adolph, youngest Son of King Frederick the First, born 1526. who, by the
assistance of his Nephew King Frederick the Second, overthrew the Rebels of
Dietmarsh, and made them subject to his Government, and through the whole course
of his Life, highly approved his Courage, on many other occasions. Moreover, he
was Consecrated Bishop of Slewick and Hildesheim. At his Death he was succeeded
in his Duchy by his Son John Adolph, who had been Archbishop of Bremen, and
Bishop of Lubeck, ever since the Year, 1585. which Provinces, however, he made
over to his Brother John Frederick, upon his coming to be Duke. In 1603. he had
Homage done him by the Hamburgers, as Duke of Horstein. His Sons were, 1.
Adolph Slain at the Battle of Leipsick, 1631. 2. John, Consecrated Bishop of
Lubeck, deceased 1655. leaving only one Son, named, John Augustus, who being
weak in his Intellects, lives under the Wardship of his Cousin-Germain, the
present Bishop of Lubeck. And, 3. Frederick, eldest of the Three, though last
named, who succeeded his Father, Anno 1616.


This Prince very much enlarged the public Library, and built the City
Frederickstadt. Moreover he sent an Embassy to the Courts of Muscovy and
Persia; and in 1658. took off the Feudatory Obligation, which, till then, lay
on the Duchy of Sleswick, to the Crown of Denmark. He departed this Life, in
the Year 1659. having had to Wife Mary Elizabeth, Daughter of John George, the

present K. of Dermark by whom he has Issue, Sophia Amalia, 1670. Frederick,
1671. Christian Augustus 1673 And Mary Elizabeth, 1678. 6. Augustus Frederick,
the present Bishop of Laiveck, who has taken to Wife Christina, Daughter of
Augustus, late Duke of Saxony, and Administrator of Magdeburg, but in all
appearance like to have no Issue by her.


CHAP. V. Of the House of Sweden.
. I. ABout the beginning of the last Century, the Nobility of Sweden, grown
weary of the Tyranny of Christian the Second, King of Denmark, elected
Gustavus, Son of Erick of Wasa a Grypsholm, first Governor, then Duke, and
last of all in the Year 1523. King of Sweden, Gothland, and the Vandals; at
which time he had a sharp War with the Danes, as also with the Russe, though
afterward he had Peace with the first. He had also a dispute with the City
Lubeck in Saxony; and departed this Life in the Year, 1660. His Queens were,
Mary, Daughter of Erick Abraham of Laholm; and Catharine, Daughter of Gustavus,
Governor of West-Gothland, by which Ladies he had Issue Three Sons, Erick,
John, and Charles.

Erick the Fourteenth of the Name, succeeding his Father in the Throne, was
Crowned in the Year 1561. and had Wars with the Panes and Pole. He committed
his Brother John to Custody, and marrying Catharine, a Woman of a base Birth,
and his Concubine before, caused her to he Crowned Queen at Stockholm, An.
1568. upon which falling into the contempt and hatred of his Brethren, he was
the Year following seized and Imprisoned, together with his new Concubine
Queen, in the very Castle of Stockholm. Hereupon the Government descended to
John the Third, second Son of Gustavus, by his Wife Mary of Laholm. This Prince
in 1570. concluded the Peace of Stetin with the Danes; as also with the City
Lubeck; but continued the War with the Czar. His Son Sigismund, by Catharine
Daughter of Sigismund King of Poland, was Crowned King of Poland, Dec. 17.
1587. Himself died 1592. having first secured the Succession of Sweden, to his
Son Sigismund, who was accordingly Crowned, Feb. 19. 1594. though the Swedish
Nobility renounced their Allegiance five Years after, viz 1699. and deprived
him of the Kingly Dignity, substituting in his place his Uncle, Charles the
Ninth, Third Son of the above named Gustavus, and Brother by the same Mother,
to the late King John the Third; under whom a War immediately broke out with
the Poles for Liffland, which afterward gave rise to another bloody One with
the Danes. There was surviving, at this time, another Son of John the Third's,
by his Wife Gunilla, Daughter of John Bielk, whose name was also John: He was
created Duke of Finland, and East-Gothland, and died without Issue, 1618.
notwithstanding he had married Mary Elizabeth, Daughter to his Uncle Charles
the Ninth.

. II. Upon which Charles, and his Posterity of both Sexes, the Crown was
settled, Sigismund and his Race being excluded for ever. He was Crowned in the
Year 1607. having been Governor of the Commonwealth, now more than seven
Years. His Death bears date 1611. in the sixty first Year of his Age. The first
Wife he married, was Anne Mary, Daughter of Lewis Elector Palatine, by whom he
had a Daughter named Catharine, living at his Death; married to John Casimire,
Count Palatine of Deux-Ponts, and by that match, Grandmother of the present
King. His second Wife's name, was Christina, Daughter of Adolph, Duke of
Holstein, who bore him Two Sons, and as many Daughters, viz.

1. Christina, deceased in her Infancy. 2. Gustavus Adolphus, of whom more in
the next Sect. 3. Mary Elizabeth, married to John Duke of Finland. And, 4.
Charles Philip, Duke of Sudermanland, deceased 1622.
. III. Gustavus Adolphus, who succeeded his Father, was born in the Year 1594.
and Crowned King of Sweden, 1617. Two years after his Father's Death he made
Peace with the Danes, An 1613. and with the Muscovites, the same Year he was
Crowned. He continued the War with the Poles, and reduced all Liffland, in the
Year 1625. making Prussia Regal the seat of War. In 1630. he made an Expedition
into Germany, for suppressing the Enemies of the Reformed Religion, where he
was slain at the Battle of Lutzen, Nov. 16. 1632. leaving Issue by Mary
Eleanor, Daughter of John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg, only a Daughter,
the Princess Christina; who, under the Regency of her Mother, carried on the
War in Germany, by her General, Charles Gustavus of Deux-Ponts, her Father's
Sister's Son. In the mean time, the Danish War broke out a fresh, till a Peace
was again concluded with 'em in the Year 1645. As also with the Emperor and
his Confederates. In 1648. she changed her Religion, and turned Catholic; and
taking her way through France, went for Rome, where she continued till the day of
her Death, which was in the Year 1689. on April 9. Old Style.

. IV. Hereupon the Government fell to Charles Gustavus, as next of Blood, being
Son to Catharine, Gustavus Adolphus's Sister, as has been already said. He was
Crowned King of Sweden, June 16. 1654. and immediately engaged in a War with
the Pole, wherein, by the assistance of his Ally, Frederick William the Great,
Elector of Brandenburg, he made himself Master of almost all Poland and
Prussia. In the mean time the Muscovites make an Incursion into Liffland, and
the Danes invade Bremen, both which he opposed with good success. He departed
this Life, Feb. 13. 1660. leaving by Hedewig Eleanor, Daughter of Frederick,
Duke of Sleswick, Charles the Eleventh, the present King, at the Age of five
Years, to succeed him. Who being educated under the Government of his Mother,
and the Nohility, by the Mediation of the French King, concluded the Peace of
St. Olives (in the first Year of his Reign, 1660.) with the Emperor, the King
of Poland, and his Serene Highness the Elector of Brandenburg. Afterward
making an Alliance with the French, he had a fresh War with the Danes, as also
the Elector of Brandenburg and his Allies, especially with the Duke of
Brunswick and Lunenburg, till Peace was once more restored by the Treaty of
Nimeguen. In 1680. he settled the Monarchy, and revoked all Grants of the Crown
Demeans, made to this or that Family by any of his Ancestors; and the same Year
married Ulrica Eleanora, Princess of Denmark, by whom he has Issue, 1. Hedewig
Sophia, born June 26. 1681. 2. Charles, Prince Royal, born June 17. 1682. 3.
Ulrick Eleanor, Jan. 21. 1688. as for Gustavus Ulrick, and Charles Gustavus,
they were both short lived.


. V. It remains, we say something of Sigismund the Third, King of Poland, who
left Two Sons.

1. Uladislaus the Fourth, his Successor in that Kingdom, who brought the
Muscovites to such terms, as made 'em Surrender to the Poles, whatever they had
taken from them till that time; nevertheless died without Issue, May 20. 1648.
And, 2. John Casimire, Jesuit and Cardinal, who upon his Brother's decease, was
by a dispensation from the Pope, Elected and Crowned King on the 17th. of
January in the same Year; yet afterward abdidicated the Government, and
resumed his Monastic Habit, being the last of the Swedish Race in Poland.
Of the Augmentation of This Family.
. VI. IT has been already observed, how Gustavus of Wasa was the first of the
present Royal Family of Sweden: He was Crowned in 1523. and at the same time
had Sweden, properly so called, put into his Possession, together with
Nord-Land, Gothland, Finland, and whatever else appertained at that time to the
Kingdom of Sweden. In 1578. the Soldiers of Liffland put themselves, with their
Families and Effects, under the Protection of Erick King of Sweden, which was
afterward confirmed by the Peace concluded at the Monastry of St. Olives in
Dantzick; by which Peace all Livonia beyond the Dwina was adjudged to the Swede
for ever; Article the 4th. Sect. 1. In 1618. Gustavus Adolphus, by the Peace
then made with the Muscovite, gained the Russian Carelia and Ingermanlands. In
1648. the hither Pomerania, with the Isle of Rugen, etc. were yielded up to the
Swedes, as were also the City of Weismar, Duchy of Bremen, and Principality of
Ferden, by the Instrument of the Peace of Osenburg, Art. 10. By the Peace of
Roschild, concluded with the Danes, 1658. there was an Accession to this Crown
of Halland, Schenen, and Bleking, together with the Government and Citadel of
Babuys, all which was ratified by the Treaty of Nimeguen.

Of its Decrease.
. VII. THere is scarce any Instance to be given in this Family, of any
diminution suffered by It; unless the Inhabitants of Ingermanland's leaving
their Native Country, and retiring into Muscovy, with their Families and
Effects, be looked upon as One; and therefore can have no Claims, were it not
that the present King of Sweden has a just pretension to the Duchy of
Deux-Ponts, taken from his Family by the French King.

CHAP. VI. Of the House of Portugal.
. I. HOw Portugal then called Lusitania, together with all Spain, became first
subject to the Roman Government; how the Goths beat out the Romans, and
established themselves there; how afterward, about the Year 714. the Moors and
Saracens, after a total defeat given Roderick, the last King of the Goths, made
themselves Masters (in a manner) of the whole Country; the brevity of our
design will not permit us to discourse at large. If any are desirous to be
acquainted with the particulars of these Transactions, let 'em consult the
famous Pufendorf, and those other Authors, mentioned by Beckman, in the first
Chapter and first Section, of his Civil History. It Is sufficient for us to
know, that toward the latter end of the Eleventh Century, Alphonso the Sixth,
King of Castile, had very frequent and bloody Wars with the Moors, in which a
certain Prince named Henry, descended (as some say) from the House of Burgundy
(as others) from that of Lorain, was chiefly signalized for his Valor, and
good Services to the Crown. King Alphonso, in reward of his Merit, gave him
Portugal, then lately recovered from the Moors, under the Title of an Earldom,
together with his natural Daughter Theresia to Wife; nevertheless with this
condition, that he should continue a Vassal to Castile. This Prince's Son was
Alphonso the First, who throwing off the Spanish Yoke, and having subdued
several petty Kings of the Moors, caused himself to be Proclaimed King of
Portugal, about the Year 1139. And departed this Life 1185. leaving for his
Successor Sanctius the First, Father of Alphonso the Second, who died in the
Year 1223. and was succeeded by Sanctius the Second, who dying without Issue,
in the Year 1246. the Crown fell to his Brother Alphonso the Third. This
Alphonso had Algarve given him in Dowry with his Queen, the Princess Beatrix,
Daughter of Alphonso the Tenth, King of Castile; and was Father of Denis, of
whose eminent Virtues, and great Actions the Pertuguese to this day relate
Wonders: It was he that Founded the University of Coimbra, and died in the Year
1325. His Son was Alphonso the Fourth, who begat Peter, (or Pedro) Father of
Ferdinand, King of Portugal, who, after many bloody Engagements with the Moors,
ended his days without Issue, in the Year 1333.

. II. Hereupon followed an Interregnum, of almost two Years continuance, when,
by the unanimous consent of all the Nobility, John the Bastard, natural Son of
Peter, mentioned in the precedent Section, was Proclaimed King; and had Issue,
1. Henry, born 1401. 2. Peter, Duke of Coimbra, put to death by his Nephew,
King Alphonso the Fifth, in the Year 1449. 3. Ferdinand taken Prisoner by those
of Barbary, and carried into Africa, where he died 1443. 4. Henry, who first
discovered the Madera Island in 1420. and died 1460. 5. Alphonso the Bastard,
Duke of Braganza, (a natural Son) deceased 1461.


Edward the Eldest, who succeeded in the Throne, married Eleanor, Daughter of
Ferdinand King of Castile; and died of the Plague, in the Year 1438. leaving
Issue Two Sons, 1. Alphonso the Fifth, born 1432. And, 2. Ferdinand, Infant of
Portugal, and Duke of Visco, deceased 1470.


Alphonso the Fifth, at his Father's death, ascended the Throne; and had sharp
and frequent Wars with the Moors; as also with Ferdinand the Catholic King of
Castile. His Death bears date 1481. at which time he was succeeded by his Son.

1. John the Second, who, notwithstanding he had taken his Cousin-Germain, the
Lady Eleanor, Daughter of Ferdinand Duke of Visco, to be his Queen, yet had he
no Issue that outlived him; his only Son Alphonso coming to an accidental
Death in the Year 1491. whereas himself Survived till 1495.

Look we back therefore to Ferdinand, Duke of Visco, and his Posterity, whose
Male Issue were, 1. James, Duke of Visco, put to death in the Year 1484. by his
Cousin-Germain, King John the Second. 2. Emanuel, 1469.


. III. This Emanuel, after the Death of King John the Second, was Crowned King
of Portugal, in the Year 1495. He expelled the Moors out of his Countries, and
obliged the Jews to profess the Christian Faith: He subdued great part of the
East Indies, and planted Brasil with Colonies from Portugal. His first Queen
was Isabel, Daughter to his Catholic Majesty Ferdinand King of Spain: His
second, Mary, Isabella's Sister: And his last, Eleanor, Daughter of Philip the
First, King of Spain, married afterward to Francis the First King of France.
By the first Lady he had Issue only one Son, Prince Michael, who had he lived,
would have Heired all the Spanish Territories: But by the second and third
Venture, 1. John the Third, the no less happy Successor of a Fortunate Father,
born 1502. married to Catharine, Daughter of Philip the First King of Spain; by
whom he had Issue John, Infant of Portugal, deceased before his Father, who
died not till the Year 1557. At which time there was surviving of the Body of
John, Infant of Portugal, by Joan his Wife, Daughter of Charles the Fifth,
Emperor and King of Spain, Prince Sebastian, a Child about Three Years of Age,
born 1554. who succeeded his Grandfather John the Third in the Kingdom of
Portugal. This unfortunate Prince, some Years after, making a descent upon
Africa, perished there with his whole Army, Aug. the 4th. 1578. 2. Isabella,
born 1503. married to Charles the Fifth, Emperor and King of Spain, 1526.
deceased 1593. 3. Henry, born 1512, promoted to a Red-Hat 1546. And afterward,
upon the most unhappy death of his Nephew Sebastian, to be King of Portugal,
but died 1580. 4. Edward, Infant of Portugal, born 1515. deceased 1540. whose
Wife was Isabel, Daughter of James Duke of Braganza, by whom he had Issue
Catharine, married to John Duke of Braganza, whose Grandson became afterward
possessed of the Crown of Portugal, as will appear, in the next Section. 5.
Lewis, Infant of Portugal, deceased 1555. leaving only a natural Son, called
Antonio, who, upon the death of his Uncle Henry, was elected King 15 --. But
being in the same Year beat out of his Country, by Philip the Second, King of
Spain, fled into France, and ended his days at Paris, An. 1595.


. IV. Thus fell the Government into the hands of the Spaniards; for Philip the
Second, partly because he was Son of Isabella, Daughter of Emanuel King of
Portugal; and partly because he had married Mary, Daughter of John the Third;
on these Pretenses made himself Master of the Kingdom by force of Arms, in the
Year 1580. Nevertheless, 'twas again lost by his Grandson, in the Year 1640.
for the Portuguese, actually rejecting the Spanish Yoke, elected John Duke of
Braganza to be their King. This Prince, born March 19. 1604. was descended of
the Posterity of Alphonso, the first Duke of Braganza, who was natural Son of
John the First, King of Portugal, as you may see, by looking back to the second
Section, Numb. 5. And his Grandmother was Catharine, Daughter of Edward Infant
of Portugal, mentioned by us in the precedent Section, Numb. 4. He governed the
State of Portugal, from 1640. till 1656. in which Year he departed this Life
Nov. 6. His Queen was Donna Lucia, Daughter of John Emanuel Perez de Gusman,
Duke of Medina Sidonia, who bore him Issue as follows: 1. Theodosius, Infant
of Portugal, deceased 1653. 2. Catharine, born at Villa Vicosa, Nov. 15. O. S.
1638. and espoused at Portsmouth, by His late Majesty King Charles the Second,
in the Month of May, 1662. 3. Alphonso the Sixth, born 1643. who under the
Regency of his Mother had sharp Wars with the Spaniards, with whom at length he
concluded a Peace in the Year 1668. In 1667. he took to Wife the Lady Mary
Frances Elizabeth, Daughter of Charles Amadeus de Savoy, Duke of Nemours, who,
after sixteen Months living with him, procured a Divorce, and retired to a
Cloister. In 1668. he was deposed, as judged incapable either of a second
Marriage or the Government, and sent the Year following to the Tercera Island,
where he ended his days 1683. 4. Peter, born 1648. who, upon his Brother
Alphonso's being Deposed in 1668. was made first Regent, and after his death,
King of Portugal. By a dispensation from his Holiness, he married the Princess
Mary Frances Elizabeth, his Brother's Wife, who, departing this Life Dec. 27.
1683. he in 1687. took to Wife the Lady Mary Sophia, Daughter of Philip
William, Elector Palatine. He has a Daughter by the first Venture now living,
viz. Mary Elizabeth, born 1669. and in 1689. Contracted to John William, eldest
Son of Philip William, Elector Palatine. As for the present Queen, she was
brought to Bed Aug. 30. 1688. of a young Prince, whose date of Life was very
short; for it died the third of Sept. in the same Year. However, there is just
now arrived an Express, whilst we were writing this, with the happy news of the
Birth of a second Prince, born this present October, 1689. to whom God grant
long Life, and happy Success: His name is John.


Of the Augmentation of This House.
. V. BY what has been already said, it plainly appears, how Alphonso the First
made Himself King of Portugal. Afterward Alphonso the Third obtained the
Kingdom of Algarve, by way of Dowry with his Queen, the Princess Beatrix,
Daughter of Alphonso the Tenth, King of Castile. In 1415. John the Bastard
possessed himself of the City of Ceuta in Africa. His Son Henry discovered the
Madera, and subdued the Fortunate Islands, and put his Countrymen in
Possession of them, An. 1620. Alphonso the Fifth took Tangier, Arcilla, and
Alcassar in Africa. Emanuel, by his General Albuquerque, made himself Master of
the Cities of Ormus, Malaca, Cochin, and Goa in the East Indies. In Africa he
subdued great part of Barbary, Guinee, Congo, the Isle of St. Thomas,
Mosambique, Melinda, Mombaza, and Zefala; as also Brasil in America. Moreover,
the Portuguese hold the City of Maoco, situate in an Island not far from China,
as also the Azores Islands, the chiefest of which is Tercera.

Of its Decrease.
. VI. Though Portugal, for some considerable time, acknowledged the Spanish
Government; yet it was restored to it self in the Fortieth Year of this
Century. Since which time little or no Encroachments have been made on it by
any King or State, except the Hollanders, whose East India Company have, by
little and little, wrested from the Portuguese (in a manner) all they were
possessed of in those Parts, some few Places excepted. From all which it is
plain, that This Family has Pretensions to no other Places, but those taken
from it by the Dutch.

CHAP. VII. Of the Palatine and Bavarian Family.
. I. HEnry the Lion, Duke of Bavaria and Saxony (of whom we shall make farther
mention, when we come to treat of the House of Brunswick and Lunenburg) being

married to Henry Earl of Goritia. 4thly. Elizabeth, given in Marriage to Otho

. II. We now return to Lewis the Severe, Count and Elector Palatine, who
elected Rudolph the First, Emperor; but was afterward Proscribed himself, by
Adolph of Nassau, the succeeding Emperor; yet, upon making his Innocence
appear, was received again into favor, and ended his days at Heidelberg, An.
1294. This Prince had Three Wives; the first of which was Mary, Daughter of
Henry Duke of Brabant, beheaded by him, out of Jealousy, Feb. 1. 1256. The

Lewis, of whom we shall treat in the 18th. Section, as Author of the Bavarian
Line. 4. Anne married to Henry Landtgrave of Hesse. And, 5. Mechtilda (or Maud)
to Otho Duke of Lunenburg.


Of the Palatine Line in particular.
. III. RUdolph succeeded his Father Lewis in the Palatinate and Electoral
Dignity, and was Author of the Rudolphine Line, whereof mention is made in the
Fourth Art. of the Instrument of the Peace of Osnaburg. This Prince opposed
himself to the Designs of the Emperor, Albert the First, which created him much
mischief. Nor could he ever agree with his Brother Lewis, who reduced him in
the end to such extremities as forced him to take Refuge in England, where he
died in Exile, An. 1319. He had to his first Wife, Mechtilda (or Maud) Daughter
to the Emperor Adolph of Nassau, deceased 1315. And to his second, an English
Princess of the same name. By the first Venture he had Issue that outlived him.

1. Adolph the First, born 1300. deceased 1327. of whom more in the next
Section. 2. Rudolph the Second, made Elector after his Brother Adolph's
decease; and being reconciled to his Uncle Lewis of Bavaria, the Emperor had
the whole Palatinate put into his hands. He departed this Life 1353. leaving
Issue by his Wife Anne, Daughter of Otho Duke of Carinthia, only one Daughter
of her Mother's name, and afterward married to the Emperor Charles the Fourth.
3. Rupert the First, who opened the University of Heidelberg, in the Year 1346.
and after his Brother Rudolph's decease, succeeded in the Electoral Dignity. He
made an Expedition against the Impostor of Brandenburg, who pretended to be
Waldomar, the late deceased Marquess of that Country; in which War Rupert
himself was taken Prisoner by Rudolph Elector of Saxony, but ransomed by the
Emperor Charles the Fourth. The day of his death happened in 1390. and
notwithstanding he were twice Married, his first Wife being Elizabeth, Countess
of Namur; his second Beatrix, Duchess of Bruges, yet left he no Issue, except
a natural Son named Anselm, Knight and Lord of Hemsbach.
. IV. Wherefore we must look back to Adolph the First, surnamed The Simple, who
begat

1. Rupert the Second, which Rupert had Wars with the Cities of Weteraw and
Alsace, in which he defeated their Forces. He likewise severely punished
several notorious Incendiaries of those Times. In 1387. he repaired the
University of Heidelberg, and departed this Life 1398. His Princess was
Beatrix, Daughter of Frederick King of Arragon, by whom he had Issue, 1. Rupert
the Third. 2. Anne, married to William Duke of Juliers. And, 3. Elizabeth, to
Procopius Marquess of Moravia.


Wenceslaus, King of Bohemia, being deposed from the Imperial Dignity, Sept. 1.
1400. Rupert the Third was elected Emperor. He gave Orders for Founding the
Cathedral of the Holy Ghost at Heidelberg, in which his Tomb and Epitaph are to
be seen to this day. He likewise made an Expedition into Italy, but with bad
Success. His Empress was Elizabeth, Daughter of Frederick the Sixth, Burgrave
of Norimberg, who bore him this following Issue, 1. Rupert the Fourth, who, by
a Marriage with Elizabeth, Daughter of John Earl of Sponheim, was the first
that Entitled his Family to that County: Nevertheless, he deceased before his
Father, and without Issue, at Amberg, An. 1395. 2. Lewis, surnamed Barbatus (or
Long-beard.) 3. John the First, who had Sultzbach in the Upper Palatinate for
his Patrimony; but of all his Sons, only Prince Christopher lived to be of Age;
who, in 1439. was Crowned King of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway; partly by
Election, and partly in Right of his Mother, who was Sister of King Erick,
descended of the Dukes of Meckleburg; as we have already taken notice of in the
first Paragraph of the Danish Family. Nevertheless, this Christopher died
without Issue, An. 1448. notwithstanding he had taken to Wife, Dorothy,
Daughter of John the Alchymist, Marquess of Brandenburg. 4. Frederick, who
lived a Bachelor at Amberg, in the Upper Palatinate. 5. Stephen the First,
born 1385. of whom we shall make farther mention in the seventh Section. 6.
John, Canon of Augsburg. 7. Margaret, married to Charles the Bold, Duke of
Lorrain. 8. Agnes to Adolph, Duke of Cleves. She died 1404. 9. Elizabeth,
married to Frederick the Third of Austria, deceased 1409. And. 10. Otho, who
obtained Mosbach and Newmark in the Upper Palatinate, for his Portion, where he
had four Sons that outlived him; Otho, who lead a single Life; Rupert the
Eighth, Bishop of Ratisbonne; John, President of the Chapter of Ausburg, And
Albert, Bishop of Strasburg.


. V. Lewis, surnamed Barbatus, who succeeded his Father in the Electoral
Dignity, had great Wars with the Turks in Palaestine, as also with the Bishop
of Mentz, and Marquess of Baden in Germany. He was President of the Council of
Constance; and in the Emperor's name commanded the Sentence there passed upon
John Husse, and Jerome of Prague, to be put in Execution. He likewise Imprisoned
Pope John the Two and Twentieth, deposed by the said Council. In his old Age,
he began to learn the Latin-Tongue, and departed this Life, An. 1439. being
merely worn out with Years, and having first lost his Eyesight. His first Wife
was Blanch, Daughter of Henry the Fourth King of England. And his second,
Maud, -- Daughter of Amadeus, Duke of Savoy, By the English Lady he had Issue
an only Son, named,

1. Rupert, surnamed Anglicanus, deceased before his Father, An. 1426. But by
the other, 1. Lewis the Fourth, surnamed The Mild, his Father's Successor, born
1424. In 1444. he had a War with Lewis Dauphin of France; and died five Years
after, leaving Issue by Margaret, Daughter of Amadeus, Duke of Savoy, Maud,
married to Lewis, Earl of Wirtemburg; and after his decease to Albert of
Austria; and Philip, who succeeded his Uncle Frederick in the Electorate, of
whom more in the next Section. 2. Frederick the First, born 1425. who, by
reason of his Nephew Philip's Infancy, obtained the Electoral Dignity for Life,
provided he should never Marry, but adopt his said Nephew. This Prince had many
Wars during his Regency, in which he generally got the better. The Counts of
Lutzelstein in Lorrain, were beat out of their Country by him; and his
Cousin-Germain, Prince Lewis of Deux-Ponts, together with the Counts of
Leiningen, Bishop of Spire, and some others suppressed. Moreover, he got the
Victory in a Battle Fought against the united Forces of the Marquess of Baden,
Bishop of Metz, and Earl of Wurtenburg. He had also many Disputes with the
Emperor, Frederick the Third, and would often refuse him Homage. He lived with
Clara a Tettingen, as with a Wife, from whom the Counts of Lowenstein have
their descent. And at last ended his days at Heidelberg, Dec. 12. 1476. 3.
Rupert the Sixth, born 1427. elected Archbishop of Cologne, 1436. deceased
1479.


. VI. Return we therefore to Philip the First, surnamed The Sincere, who grew
up under the Tuition and Regency of his Uncle Frederick, after whose decease he
took the Government upon himself. He created himself much mischief, by
supporting his Son Rupert's Title to the Lower Bavaria; insomuch as he had like
to have lost all his own Dominions on that Account: Nevertheless was at length
reconciled to the Emperor, yet died of Grief, Feb. 28. 1508. having seen
himself the Father ^f Thirteen Children, by his Wife Margaret, Daughter of
Lewis, surnamed The Rich, Duke ^f Bavaria, whose Names were as follow, 1. Lewis
the Fifth, born July 2. 1478. who succeeded his Father in the Electorate, and
was a great Lover of Peace and Concord. At the Diet of Worms he publicly
opposed the Papists, who looked upon themselves as not obliged to observe the
safe Conduct, granted to such as should come hither on Luther's behalf:
Moreover, he suppressed the Seditious Insurrections of the Country Boors, by
force of Arms. In 1532. he obtained the Peace of Religion, which was the first
that was ever granted those of the Reformation. When the Imperial Crown was
offered him, he refused it; and was highly esteemed and beloved by the Emperor
Charles the Fifth. Whilst he was yet a Papist, he permitted a free Toleration
of Religion to the Protestants. He departed this Life March 16. 1544. having
had to Wife Sibilla, Daughter of Albert the Fourth Duke of Bavaria; but by her
no Issue. 2. Philip the Second, born May 7. 1480. Consecrated Bishop of
Treising, 1496. of Naumburg, 1512. deceased 1541. 3. Rupert the Tenth, surnamed
The Virtuous, born May 14. 1581. and Elected Bishop of Freising, which
Bishopric he afterward surrendered to his Brother Philip, and married the sole
Daughter and Heiress of George the Rich, Duke of Bavaria, which Match gave rise
to a most bloody War, 'twixt the Palatine and Bavarian Lines. This Prince
departed this Life before his Father, An. 1504. leaving Issue by Elizabeth,
Daughter of George Duke of Bavaria aforesaid, 1. Otho Henry, born 1502. in the
beginning of his Life an unhappy Princes Of all his Mother's Inheritance, he
obtained only the Duchy of Newburg. In 1542. he made public Profession of the
Reformed Religion; and succeeding in the Electorate, at the decease of his
Uncle Frederick the Second, wholly extirpated the Romish Religion out of all
the Palatinate. He was also Founder of the Library a^ Heidelburg; and died
without Issue, 1559. And, 2. Philip the Third, born 1503. who is 1529. bravely
defended Vienna, against the dreadful Assaults of the Turkish Army, being at
that time Governor o^ the City, where he highly signalized his Courage. He
deceased a Batchellor, 1548.
4. Frederick the Second, surnamed The Wise, as also The Pious, born Dec. 9.
1483. This Prince spent his Youth in the Court of Philip of Austria; and was
afterward made -- to Charles the Fifth. He was likewise present at the
Election of the said Charles, as Proxy for his Brother Lewis the Elector; and
in 1519. sent to him to signify his Promotion to the Imperial Throne. After
that he was often his Deputy and Vicar in his Absence. In most of the Dyets he
was one of the chief Counselors; and President of that held in 1528. He twice
headed the Imperial Armies against the Turks, and forced Solomon to raise his
Siege from before Vienna. In 1544. he succeeded his Brother in the Electoral
Dignity. In 1546. he made Profession of the Protestant Faith, and began to
introduce the same into his Dominions. Nevertheless he admitted the Book,
Entitled, Interim, for fear he might too far incense the Emperor, Charles the
Fifth. He departed this Life in the 73d. Year of his Age, An. 1556. having had
to Wife, Dorothy, Daughter of Christian the Second, King of Denmark, but by her
no Issue. 5. George the First, born Feb. 10. 1486. elected Bishop of Sponheim,
1513. He began to build the Fortification and Castle of Udenheim, since called
Philipsburg; and died 1529. 6. Henry, Bishop of Worms, born Feb. 15. 1587.
deceased 1552. or 1554. 7. John, Bishop of Ratisbonne, born 1488 deceased 1538.

he likewise died of Old Age, Apr. 2. 1558. 9. Otho Henry, born and dead the

after his decease, by Philip, Marquess of Baden; she died 1522. And, 13.
Catharine, who was Veiled a Nun.


. VII. Matters thus far cleared, we now return to Stephen, fifth Son to the
Emperor Rupert, of whom we made mention in the fourth Section, Numb. 5. This
Prince had the County of Simmeren for his Patrimony; and took to Wife the Lady
Anne, the only Daughter of Frederick Count Veldentz, with whom he had that
whole County, as also great part of the County of Sponheim. She likewise bore
him Issue, 1. Frederick, born 1417. 2. Margaret, deceased a Maid, An. 1426. 3.

upon which account he was made President of the Imperial Chamber at Spire, by
the Emperor Charles the Fifth. He departed this Life, An. 1557. having had Two

Brother George's Decease without Issue, became Possessed of the Principality of
Simmeren. He was a great Stickler for the Lutheran Confession, which was the

by us in the sixth Section, Numb. 3.) without Issue, succeeded him in the
Electorate, as next of Blood, An. 1559. This Prince established the Reformed
Religion in his Dominions, upon which Account he suffered very much. In 1560 he
caused a Conference to be held at Heidelberg, and Published the Heidelberg
Catechism, three Years after. He was likewise a vigorous Promoter of the
Hugonets Cause in France; and sent assistance to the Dutch. His first Marriage
was with Mary, Daughter of Casimire, Marquess of Brandenburg, deceased Oct. 21.
1567. After which, he took to Wife the Lady Aemilia, Daughter to Humbert, Earl

Lewis the Sixth was his Father's Successor, and wholly addicted to Luther's
way of Worship, as also a constant Reader of the Holy Scriptures. Moreover he
subscribed the Book of Concord, being a very Peaceable Prince, never meddling
with other Men's matters. His first Princess was, Elizabeth, Daughter of Philip,
Landtgrave of Hesse; who deceasing in 1582. he took to Wife Anne, Daughter of

great Battle Fought in a place called the White Hill, not far from Prague, was
forced to fly into Holland; whereupon he was forthwith Proscribed, deposed from
his Electoral Dignity, and beat out of all his Dominions, notwithstanding the
great distaste shown thereat by the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg, and many
other Princes. Nevertheless, the greater part of the Palatinate being
recovered, after the Battle of Leipsick, by Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden;
Frederick, after ten Years Exile, came to Frankfort, in the Year 1632. and
continued in those Parts for some time: But this was only a Mockery of Fortune;

. XI. We now return to Charles Lewis, who during his Father's Exile, was
brought up in Holland, where he made great Proficiency in the Study of
Languages and other Sciences.

By the Peace of Prague, there was only an Allowance settled on him and his
Brethren, suitable to their Quality; but at length by that of Munster and
Osenburg in 1648. He had the Lower Palatinate, and Bergstrasse restored him,
and was constituted the Eighth Elector, and Chief Treasurer of the Empire. At
the same time was the University of Heidelberg restored; Liberty of Conscience
granted the Protestants; Measures taken for restoring Peace to the Church, and
Manheim repaired. Upon the Decease of the Emperor Ferdinand the Third, there
was a Dispute betwixt him and the Elector of Bavaria, touching their right to
the Vicarship of the Empire, during the Inter-regnum: He had also several
Contests for the Wildtangiate. In 1650. he took to Wife Charlotte, Daughter of
William the Fifth, Landtgrave of Hesse, who afterward was parted from him, and
returned home, upon some Discontents that arose between 'em. Nevertheless, he
had Issue by her, Charlotte Elizabeth, born 1652. and married in 71. to Philip
Duke of Orleans, the present French King's only Brother; and Charles, born
March 31. 1651. who indeed succeeded him, but outlived him only five Years,
deceasing May 16. 1685. and that without Issue; notwithstanding he had taken to
Wife, Wilhelmina Ernestina Daughter of Frederick the Third, late King of
Denmark, and Sister to Christian the Fifth, the present King. Moreover, it is to
be noted of Prince Charles Lewis the Father, that besides the Princess of
Hesse, his lawful Wife, he super-induced another, whose name was Lovise
Degenfeld, by whom he had this Issue living at his Death.

1. Charles Lewis, the Rhinegrave, born 1658. 2. Charlotte, born 1659. and
married to Meinhard Count Schomberg, 1683. 3. Lovise, born Jan. 15. 1661. 4.
Aemilia Elizabeth, born March 22. 1663. 5. Charles Edward, born May 9. 1668. 6.
Charles Maurice, Dec. 30. 1670. 7. Charles Auguste, Oct. 9. 1672. And, 8.
Charles Casimire, Apr. 22. 1675.
. XII. It Is now time that Lewis, surnamed The Black, mentioned by us in the
seventh Section, Numb. 3. be brought once more on the Stage. In the division of
the Hereditary Provinces, 'twixt him and his Brother Frederick, he obtained the
Duchy of Deux-Ponts, and County of Veldentz, for his Patrimony, wherein he was
succeeded at his death, An. 1489. by his Son Alexander, who marrying the Lady
Margaret, Daughter of Crato Earl of Hohenloh, had Issue Lewis the Second, born
1502. George, Canon of Cologne and Triers, and Rupert, who became possessed of
the Counties of Lautereck and Veldentz, by the grant of his Nephew Wolfgang of
Newburg; and was succeeded in the same by his Son George John, who, by the
donation of his Kinsman Otho Henry, the Elector, became possessed of the County
of Lutzelstein also; and departed this Life 1592. leaving Issue by Anne Mary,
Daughter of Gustavus King of Sweden, as follows.

1. George Gustavus, born Feb. 6. 1564. 2. Anne Margaret, married to Richard
Count Palatine in Simmeren, An. 1591. 3. Ursula, born 1573. married to Lewis,
Duke of Wurtenburg, of the Line of Mompelgart, 1585. deceased 1636. 4. John
Augustus, born 1575. deceased without Issue, Sept. 18. 1611. 5. Lewis Philip,
born 1577. and Slain at Heidelberg, by accident in a Tournament, An. 1601. 6.
Joan Elizabeth, born 1579. deceased 1599. 7. George John, born 1586. whose Wife
was the Lady -- Daughter of Otho Henry Count Palatine in Sultzbach, by whom he
had four Children; but none of them outlived him.
Wherefore George Gustavus, who departed this Life 1634. was the only
Propagator of the Branch of Veldentz, having had by his Wife Mary Elizabeth,
Daughter of John the First, Count Palatine of Deux-Ponts, this following Issue;
namely, 1. Anne Magdalen, born 1602. and married to Henry Duke of Munsterberg:
she died, 1630. 2. John Frederick, Colonel of the Swedish Regiment, deceased
1632. 3. Charles Lewis, who likewise served under His Swedish Majesty, and died
of his Wounds at Wolmerstadt, July 17. 1631. 4. Magdalen Sophia, born Nov. 24.
1622. deceased 1631. 5. Mary Sibilla, who was an Abbess, and died 1649. 6.
Leopold Lewis, born Feb. 1. 1625. By the Peace of Osenbrug, he recovered the
County of Veldentz; and in 1654. he became possessed of that of Lutzelstein
also, by right of Inheritance. Nevertheless, in the last French War, he was
beat out of all, and has ever since lived in Exile. His Children, by the
Princess Agatha Christina, Daughter to Philip Wolfgang, Count of Hanaw, are, 1.
Anne Sophia, born 1650. 2. Gustavus Philip, born 1651. deceased 1679. 3.
Elizabeth Joan, born 1653. and married to John, Rhinegrave in Mortchingen. 4.
Christina, born 1654. deceased the Year following. 5. Christian Lewis, born
1656. deceased 1658. 6. Dorothy, born 1658. 7. Leopold Lewis, 1659. deceased
1660. 8. Charles George, born May 27. 1660. and Slain at the Storming of Buda,
1686. 9. Agatha Eleanor, born 1662. deceased 1664. And, 10. Augustus Leopold,
born 1663. and Slain at the Siege of Mentz, 1689.



. XIII. We must now look back to Lewis the Second, of whom we made mention in
the beginning of the last Section. He succeeded his Father Lewis the Black, and
had the Duchy of Dexu Ponts settled on him; as also the Counties of Veldentz
and Sponheim; out of all which Provinces he totally extirpated the Romish
Religion, and embraced Luther's Faith. He departed this Life in the Year 1532.
and was succeeded by his Son Wolfgang, born 1526. This Wolfgang had Newburg, on
the Danube, and Sultzbach, afterward given him by his Kinsman Otho Henry the
Elector: Whereupon he made over the Counties of Veldentz and Lautereck to his
Uncle Rupert. Afterward he ordered by his Will, that his Posterity should
Branch themselves into two Lines, viz. Deux-Ponts and Newburg; and that in
both, the Right to Succession by Birthright should be observed: to Newburg he
subjected Sultzbach, as Birkenfeld to Deux-Ponts. His Death fell in the Year
1569. at which time he had Four Sons surviving by his Wife the Princess Anne,
Daughter of Philip the Stout, Landtgrave of Hesse, whose names were, Philip
Lewis, born Oct. 1. 1547. John the First, born May 18. 1550. Otho Henry, July
22. 1556. deceased 1604. and Charles, Propagator of the Branch of Birkenfeld,
Sept. 4. 1560.

Of the Line of Newburg.
. XIV. PHilip Lewis, in whom this Line began, was a Prince famous for his great
Prudence, in the Government of his Family, as also for his Zeal to Religion. He
departed this Life in the Year 1614. leaving Issue by Anne, Daughter of William
Duke of Cleve, 1. Anne Mary, born Aug. 12. 1575. married to Frederick William,
the first Duke of Sax-Altenburg, deceased Feb. 1. 1643. 2. Dorothy Sabina, born

in the next Section, when we come to treat of that Branch. 6. Aemilia Hedewig,
born 1584. deceased 1607. And, 7. John Frederick, born Aug. 23. 1587. deceased
1647. His Wife was Sophia Agnes, Daughter of Lewis, Landtgrave of
Hesse-Darmstadt, by whom he had Six Children, yet not one of them survived him.


Wolfgang William, who succeeded his Father in the Duchy of Newburg, An. 1614.
turned Papist the same Year, and by that means was very uneasy to his Mother
and Brethren. He was embroiled in the Low Country Wars for the Succession to
the Duchy of Juliers, and departed this Life 1653. having had three Wives; the
first being Magdalen, Daughter of William Duke of Bavaria, deceased 1628. The
second, Catharine Charlotte, Daughter of John the Second, Dake of Deux Ponts,
deceased March 21. 1651. and the third Mary Frances, Daughter of Francis Egon,
Earl of Furstenburg, who died the same Yeat she was married, viz. May 7. 1652.
By the first of these Ladies he was Father of Philip William, the present Duke,
born Nov. 24. 1615. who succeeded him at his Death, An. 1643. In 1666. the
difference 'twixt him and the Elector of Brandenburg, touching their Right of
Succession to the Dutchies of Cleves and Juliers, was fairly accommodated,
after several sharp Disputes, which at length ended in Blows. After the decease
of Charles, Elector Palatine, which happened (as has already been said) in 1685.
He became possessed of the Electorate, by Virtue of the Instrument of the Peace
of Osenburg, Art. 5. Nevertheless, he has been since thrown Out, contrary to
all Law and Equity, by the French King. An. 1688. And although he had recovered
many Places in It, in the Year 1689. by the assistance of the Confederates; yet
he continues as yet at Newburg. In 1642. he took to Wife the Princess Anne
Catharine Constance, Daughter of Sigismund the third King of Poland. After
whose decease, An. 1651. he most happily contracted himself, a second time, in

Of the Bavarian Line.
. XVIII. IT has already been observed in the second Section of this Chapter,
that Lewis the Third was third Son of Elector Lewis the First. He was Born
1277. carefully brought up by his Mother at Vienna in Austria, had the Upper
Bavaria for his Patrimony, and was elected Emperor 1314. After the decease of
his Cousin John, Duke of the Lower Bavaria, who had married his Daughter, he
entered on the Possession of the greatest part of his Inheritance. He likewise
seized on the Electorate of Brandenburg, upon the death of Woldemar, Marquess
thereof, bestowing the same on his own Son Lewis. Moreover, he had War with
Frederick the Fair; Archduke of Austria, whom he took Prisoner in the end, An.

He departed this Life 1375. having had Elizabeth, Daughter of Lewis King of

the Second, Burgrave of Norimberg, to his Second. His Issue, by the first
Venture, were, 1. Stephen the Second, who had Ingolstadt, and the Lands

Landshut, and the Lands belonging thereunto, assigned him for his Patrimony; of

Now Frederick was surnamed The Wise, and very happy in making People Friends,
when at difference. He departed this Life at Landshut, Dec. 4. 1393. leaving
Issue by Magdalen, Daughter of Bernabovius, Vice-Count of Milan, his Second

1443. 3. Margaret, by Mark Vice-Count of Milan. 4. Henry, who being left an
Orphan by his Parents in his tender Years, had his Estate ruined, in a manner,
by the ill management of Guardians; yet afterward, by the more prudent Conduct
of a certain Priest, very well acquainted with the methods of Housekeeping,
and improving an Estate, not only redeemed all things that had been any ways
Imbezel'd or Mortgaged; but being given to Parcimony, laid up such great
Treasures, that in short, he obtained the name of Rich. He departed this Life
in the Year 1450. having had to Wife, Anne, Daughter of Albert the Fourth of
Austria: His Children by her, necessary to be here mentioned, were Joan and
Elizabeth; the one married to Otho Count Palatine in Mosbach; The other to
Ulrick Count Wirtenburg, and died 1478. As also,
1. Lewis, a very dutiful Son, who was likewise his Successor, and had many
Wars. In 1450. he banished the Jews, confiscating their Estates and Effects to

Will, which gave rise to a very bloody War 'twixt the Palatine and Bavarian
Lines. Margaret, professed a Nun; Lewis the Ninth, deceased before his Father;
And Rupert in his Infancy.

. XX. Matters thus far cleared, return we now to John, youngest Son of Stephen
the First, who, in the division of the Hereditary Teritories, had Munchen for

Batchellor, An. 1514.


. XXI. We now return to Albert, who maintained a very bloody War against
Philip, Elector Palatine for the Succession to the Inheritance of George the

Cunigund, Daughter of the Emperor Frederick the Third, as follows, 1. William

admirer of Learning. His Duchess was Renata, Daughter of Francis Duke of

Maximilian, born April 17. 1573. succeeded his Father in the Duchy of
Bavaria. In 1609. he was declared Head of the Catholic League, and seized on
Donawert. Feb. 25. 1623. he obtained the Electoral Dignity, together with the
Upper Palatinate, and County of Chamb, which was afterward confirmed by the

Leuchtenberg, that Country fell to Albert Duke of Bavaria, and from him to the
Electoral Line. As for Maximilian, he departed this Life in Sept. 1651. having
had Elizabeth, Daughter of Charles the Second, Duke of Lorrain, to his first

great Abilities, in respect both to Civil and Military Affairs. In 1685/6. he

Of the Augmentation of the Palatine-Bavarian Family.
. XXIII. AFter that Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, had been
Proscribed and Outed of all his Territories, by the Emperor Frederick
Barbarossa; Otho the First, Earl of Witelsbach, had both the Bavaria's, as well
Upper as Lower, granted him for ever, by the said Emperor: To which also
belonged at that time, the Counties of Scherding and Newburg, together with the
Lordship of Burchausen: Moreover he purchased the Counties of Dachow and
Ritenburg; as also the Lordships of Rotenburg and Rheningen. This Prince's
Grandson, Otho the Second, by a Marriage with the sole Daughter and Heiress of
Henry Count Palatine, obtained by Permission of the then Emperor, the
Palatinate of the Rhine, being invested also at the same time with the
Electoral Dignity, An. 1227. After this he bought the Castle of Lindenfeld, and
City of Nusloch in Cregovia, An. 1256. and had Waldorf, with the City of
Wiselach, given him by the Emperor Henry. In 1281. Rodulph the First, Emperor,
gave the County of Mosburg to Lewis the First, Elector Palatine: The same
Prince became possessed of Ferden, Landberg, Wilswiburg, Chagen, Landau,
Mumuro, Elbrecht-Kirchen, and Libenau, by right of Inheritance. Afterward upon
Conradine, Duke of Schwaben's being Beheaded, there was an Accession of
Lawgingen Hochstadt, Schongau, Swabeck, Tussen, Moringen, Neumark, and Amberg,
with some other Places, to his other Territories: Moreover, he bought
Schreisheim with the Castle of Stralenberg; as also the City of Bretten in
Cregovia. In 1392. Rupert had half the County of Sponbeim in Dowry with his
Wife; the other half whereof together with the City Pfortzheim, fell likewise
to this Family, in the time of the Elector Frederick the First. At the same
time that Rupert the Son became possessed of half Sponheim: Rupert the Emperor,
his Father, had the County of Simmeren Mortgaged to him, which was afterward
wholly assigned over to this Family. Moreover, he bought the County of
Deux-Ponts for 25000. Florins. In 1404. Lewis ^^ Elector, second Son to the
said Emperor, and E^pingon in Cregovia Sold him by the then Muquess of Eaden.
Much about the same time he was put in possession of the County of Kirchberg
also. In 1410. Stephen the First, in Right or his Wife, had the County of
Veldentz settled on him. In 1441. Frederick the First, Outed the Earls of
Lowenstein, and seized on their Lands; to which there was Accession of
Lutzeilstein, not many Years after. The same Frederick had Bergstrasse
Mortgaged to him by the Archbishop of Mentz. Maximilian of Bavaria took
Donawert 1607. bought the County of Middlebeim in Schwaben, 1618. and succeeded
to the Landtgraviate of Leuchtenberg some Years after, by right of
Confraternity, or Act of Agreement to a mutual Succession. The same Prince had
an Eighth Electorship confirmed on him, by the Instrument of the Peace of
Osenburg, An. 1648. In 1654. Charles Gustavus of Deux-Ponts was Crowned King of
Sweden; whose Brother Adolph John has also acquired very large Possessions in
the said Kingdom. In 1666. Philip William, Duke of Newburg, since Elector
Palume, obtained the Dutchies of Julters and Mons, together with the County of
Ravenstein, by an amicable agreement 'twixt his Serene Highness, and the
Elector of Brandenburg.

Of its Decrease.
. XXIV. THe greatest Losses suffered by the Palatine-Bavarian Family, have been
in our Age; for by the Fourth Article of the Peace of Osenburg, Maximilian Duke
of Bavaria, was obliged to Cancel the Mortgage he had on the Upper Austria; as
also to restore Bergstrasse to the Archbishop of Mentz, by the same
Pacification. In the next French War, the King of France, without a Blush, made
himself Master of the Duchy of Deux Ponts, and County of Veldentz, together
with many Cities, on pretense they were Dependants of Alsace. In 1689. upon
pretense of some other sham Title, he made no scruple to possess himself of the
Counries of Sponbeim, Simmeren, and Lautereck: Nay, he invaded the very
Palatinate of the Rhine, putting the same under Contributions, and utterly
ruining the Inhabitants by his Exactions. What will be the future State of
these Provinces, time must show.

Of its Pretensions.
. XXV. FRom these Encroachments some Pretensions must needs arise: And indeed
the King of Sweden has the fairest Title in the World to the Duchy of
Deux-Ponts, as next Heir Male. And then the present Elector Palatine, Philip
William, demands not only Restoration of the Provinces taken from him by the
French King; but likewise satisfaction for the Damages done him in those that
are left. Moreover, the Count Palatine in Veldeniz has lost his whole Earldom,
which likewise demands to be restored.

CHAP. IX. Of the Family of Saxony, as well Electoral as Ducal.
. I. ALbert the Third, Elector of Saxony, descended of the Family of Anhalt (of
whose Ancestors we shall ^^y more, when we come to treat of that Family) coming
to an unexpected and acciden^al end, as also without Issue, An. 1422 Fre^^rick
the Warlike, Marquess of Misnia, and Landtgrave of Thuringe, Son of Frederick
the Strong, was invested in the Electoral Dignity by the Emperor Sigismund, An.
1425. whence ^he Marquesses of Misnia were descended, the ^revity of our design
will not permit us ^o discourse in this place; Those that are de^^rous, may be
informed in that matter, by consulting the Learned Spener's Sylloge Genealogica
(...) Familia Witekindea Saxonica. Now Frederick ^^d opened an University at
Leipsick, some Years before he was made Elector, viz. 1209. ^^is Prince had
also many Wars during his Government, as namely, in Franconia, with the Poles
in Bornsia; with the Counts of Schwartz^urg, Heldrungen, and Hohenstein in
Thuringia: Moreover, with the Elector of Brandenburg; and lastly, with the
Bohemians or Hussites, by whom his Forces were defeated, with a very great
Slaughter, An. 1426. His Death bears date two Years after; and his Duchess was
Catharine, Daughter of Henry Duke of Brunswick and Lunenburg, who bore him this
following Issue, viz.

1. Frederick, born Aug. 24. 1412. of whom in the next Section. 2. Sigismund,
Bishop of Wurtzburg, born 1416. deceased of a Dropsy, 1457. 3. Henry, born
1422. deceased 1435. 4. Anne, married to Lewis the Third, Landtgrave of Hesse;
deceased 1463. 5. Catharine, married in 1441. to Frederick the Second, Elector
of Brandenburg. And, 6. William, born 1425. who had the Landtgraveship of
Thuringe, assigned him for his Patrimony. At first he had Wars with his
Brother; but in the end they were reconciled, and agreed very well. In short,
he refused the Crown of Bohemia, when offered: Took particular care for
suppressing the notorious Insolences of the Robbers, that then infested his
Countries: And after the decease of Anne of Austria, Daughter of Albert the
Third, his first Wife, An. 1462. took the Lady Catharine de Brandenstein, to
his Second: By the first of which he had Issue Two Daughters, 1. Anne, born
1453. betrothed to Henry Duke of Munsterberg; but died before the Marriage was
consummated; And, 2. Margaret, married to John Elector of Brandenburg; deceased
1511.

Wherefore William seeing himself destitute of Issue Male, adopted Ernestus and
Albertus, his Brother Frederick's Sons; and departed this World, 1482.

. II. Frederick the Second, who succeeded his Father in Misnia, and the
Electorate, suffered very much from the Hussites: He would not be prevailed
with to make War upon the Archbishop of Magdeburg. He departed this Life Sept.
7. 1464. having had to Wife Margaret, Daughter of Erneste of Austria, and by
her a large Offspring; whereof Three Sons and a Daughter died Young. Those
that out^iv'd him, were Two Sons, and Four Daughters, whom we shall-set down in
the following Order, viz.

1. Amalia, the Wife of Lewis the Rich, Duke of Bavaria, born 1435. deceased
Nov. 18. 1502. 2. Anne, born 1436. married to Albert Achilles, Elector of
Brandenburg, Nov. 12. 1458. deceased Oct. 31. 1512. 3. Ernestus, born March 25.
1441. of whom in the next Section, as Author and Progenitor of the Ernestine
Line. 4. Albert, born July 27. 1443. of whom see more below, in the Albertine
Line. 5. Hedewig, Lady Abbess of Quedelinburg, who had much ado with the
Inhabitants of that Place, yet Mastered 'em in the end, by the assistance of
her Brother, Duke Albert, commanding at the same time the Roland, they had set
up in sign of Liberty to be thrown down: This Lady departed this Life Nov. 12.
1511. And, 6. Margaret, Lady Abbess of Seuselitz.
Of the Ernestine Line.
. III. ERnestus, who succeeded his Father in the Dignity of Elector, was a Wise
Prince, and very happy in reconciling the Differences of Princes. He maintained
the strictest Friendship with his Brother Albert, with whom he administered all
things (as it were) in Common. He bought the Duchy of Sagan in Silesia, of the
last Duke thereof, for 55000 Hungarian Crowns. Moreover, he went to Rome, where
he was presented with a Rose of Gold, by Pope Sixtus the Fourth. And last of
all changed this Life for a better, in the Year 1486. His Duchess was
Elizabeth, Daughter of Albert the Third, Duke of Bavaria, deceased 1484. having
born him this following Issue, viz.

1. Christina, born Sept. 28. 1462. married to John, King of Sweden and
Denmark, 1478. deceased 1531. 2. Frederick the Third, born 1463. who succeeded
his Father in the Electorate, and was surnamed The Wise. He built the Castle at
Wittenberg; where he likewise opened an University, in the Year 1502. He
reconciled Philip, Elector Palatine to the Emperor Maximilian, after whose
decease he might have been elected Emperor himself, but refused it. He appeased
the Commonalty of Erfurdt, when in uproar against the Senate. He stood up in
Luther's defense, at his first setting the Reformation on foot, ordering him a
Guard for his safety at Wurtzburg, in his return from the Diet at Worms, An.
1521. Last of all, this Religious Prince departed this Life, May 5. 1525. in
the 63 d. Year of his Age, just after the Rising of the Boors, having lived a
Batchellor, and been long troubled with the Stone. 3. Albert the Second,
Archbishop of Mentz, born 1464. not long lived; for he died May 1. 1484. 4.
Erneste, born 1466. elected Archbishop of Magdeburg, 1476. made Administrator
of Halberstadt, 1489. deceased in the Castle at Hall, 1513. 5. John, born June
29. 1469. of whom in the next Section, as only Propagator of this Line. 6.
Wolfgang, deceased an Infant. And, 7. Margaret, married to Henry Duke of
Brunswick, of the Line of Zell; deceased Dec. 7. 1528.
. IV. John, succeeded his Brother in the Electoral Dignity, and gave a total
defeat to the Rebellious Boors; taking their Leader, Thomas Muntzer, Prisoner.
In 1529. he, with some other Princes, entered their solemn Protestation against
the designs of the Catholics. The Year after, he presented the Protestant
Confession to the Emperor Charles the Fifth; and caused its Apology to be
written: Moreover, he was Author of the League of Smalkald. He departed this
Lise Aug. 13. 1532. having had Sophia, Daughter of Magnus Duke of Meckleburg
(married to him, An. 1500. deceased 1503.) to his first Wife: And Margarets
Daughter of Woldemar, Prince of Anhalt, (esponsed by him, in 1513. deceased

Of the Albertine Line.
. IX. MAtters thus far cleared, we now return to the Albertine Line; which
began in Albert the First, youngest Son of Frederick the Second, Elector of
Saxony; as we observed above in the second Section. He was born July 27. 1443.
and by reason of his tall Stature, surnamed Roland. In 1468. he assisted
George, King of Bohemia, against Matthias, King of Hungary. In 1471. he went
into Bohemia, to accept the Crown of that Kingdom, then offered him, where he
was in great danger of his Life, yet happily escaped; and afterward went in
Pilgrimage to the Holy Land. In 1491. he was Installed Knight of the Golden
Fleece. Moreover, he reduced the Low Countries to the Obedience of the Emperor
Maximilian, and obtained a grant of Succession to the Dutchies of Juliers and
Mons, in case those in Possession, or their Heirs, should fail in Issue Male.
In 1459. he married Sidonia, Daughter of George Podiebrach, King of Bohemia,

. X. This Henry succeeded his Brother George, and was the only Propagator of
the Albertine Line: He made Profession of the Reformed Religion, and entered

Second, Duke of Meckleburg, who bore him this following Issue, viz.

1. Maurice, born May 11. 1525. who succeeded his Father, and served the

Afterward he carried on a bloody War against his Cousin John Frederick the
Elector, who being degraded of that Dignity, he was invested with the same, by
the Emperor Charles the Fifth, An. 1548. In 1551. he made an Alliance with the
French King, and several of the German Princes; and then undertook an
Expedition against the Imperialists. The Year after, he was concluded in the
Transaction of Passaw, yet Slain in 1553. at the Battle of Siverskuse in the
Duchy of Lunenburg. It Is likewise observable, he founded Three famous Schools

Authority was always very great in the Empire; insomuch as all things (in a
manner) were managed by him: Moreover, he laid up a very great Treasure. In

Six a Clock in the Evening, on Feb. 11. 1586, his first Wife was the Princess
Anne, Daughter of Christian the Third, King of Denmark, who died Oct. 1 1585.

in the Electoral Dignity, born Nov. 3. 1560. In 1582. he married Sophia,
Daughter of John George, Elector of Brandenburg, who departed this World 1622.
as himself had done many Years before, viz. 1591. His Children are said to have
been as follow; 1. Christian the Second, born Sept. 23. 1583. who succeeded his
Father in the Electorate, under the Government and Tuition of his Cousin, Duke
Frederick William of Aldenburg. He commanded his Chancellor Nicholas Crelley to

Dutchies o^ Juliers, Cleves, and Mons. The Year following he died of an
Apoplexy, caused by taking too large a draught of Small-Beer, after
over-heating himself with Tilting. Nor left he any Issue, though married to
Hedewig, Daughter of Frederick the Second, King of Denmark. 2. John George the

having first Traveled Incognito into many Foreign Parts. In 1612. he took on
him the Vicarship of the Empire, during the Interregnum. In 1617. he caused the
first Jubilee to be Celebrated in memory of the Reformation began by Luther an
hundred Years before: Another in 1630. for the Augustane Confession: And a
third 1655. for the Peace of Religion, or Transaction at Passaw, causing
several Medals to be Coined on those Occasions. He was a most dutiful Son to
his Mother, for whom he had a more than ordinary Veneration. He elected
Matthias, Ferdinand the Second, Ferdinand the Third, and Ferdinand the Fourth,
King of the Romans; and refused the Offer of the Bohemian Crown. About 1631. he
leagued himself with the Swede, against the Emperor, with whom he again made
Peace, in 1635. leaving his Ally the Swede: Who thereupon lay very hard on him,
till a general Peace was once more restored to the Empire, An. 1648. This
excellent Prince departed this Life in the Year 1656. and the 72d. of his Age.
His first Wife was Sibil Elizabeth, Daughter of Frederick Duke of Wurtenburg,

Election of a new King of the Romans. In 1671. he entered into Articles of a
mutual Succession, with Julius Francis, Duke of the Lower Saxony. In 1638. he

the Government of the Electorate, after the decease of his Father, of ever

Of the Augmentation of the Saxon Family.
. XVI. WE have already declared, how Frederick the Warlike, Marquess of Misnia,
and Landtgrave of Thuringe, obtained of the Emperor Sigismund, the Investiture
of the Electoral Dignity, together with the Palatinate of Saxony, and
Burgraviate of Magdeburg, An. 1425. The same Prince is supposed by most to have
bought the Burgraviate of Meissen also. In 1440. William had part of the Duchy
of Luxenbing in Dowry with his Wife. Ernestus the First added Plaven,
Voightsberg, Olnitz and Adorff, in the Land of Advocates. The same Prince
bought the Duchy of Sagan in Silesia, paying down 55000 Hugarian Ducats.
Albert the Stout had East Friezland assigned him, to be held in Fee of the
House of Austria. The Elector Augustus made the Diocesses of Naumburg and
Mersburg Hereditary to his Family. In 1583. the Principality of Henneberg fell
to it, by Right of Agreement to a mutual Succession; part of which (namely, the
District of Coburg) had been long before this, made over in Dowry to the
Marquesses of Misnia. In 1635. John George the First, recovered both the Upper
and Lower Lusatia' which of old belonged to his Ancestors the Marquesses of
Misnia. In 1648. Augustus was chosen and declared Administrator of the
Archbishopric of Magdeburg. In 1659. John George the Second obtained the
County of Barbie. Moreover, he added Querfurt, Iuterbock, Dam, Borck,
Fravenstein, etc. to his other Territories. And lastly, part of the County of
Mansfeld, fell into the Possession of this Family, by the last German War, and
is called in the German Language, Die Sachwische Hoheit.

Of its Decrease.
. XVII. WIlliam, Duke of Saxony sold the Right he had to the Duchy of
Luxenburg to Philip Duke of Burgundy, for 11000 Schillings. In 1549. Elector
Maurice made over in Change, the Principality of Sagan in Silesia, to Ferdinand
the First, afterward Emperor. In 1680. upon the decease of Augustus,
Archbishop of Magdeburg, that Archbishopric, but with the Title of a Duchy,
fell to the Electoral Line of Brandenburg, according to the Tenor of the
Pacification of Osenburg, great part of the Burgraviate of Magdeburg being
annexed thereunto at the same time, to the general satisfaction of all Parties.

Of its Pretensions.
. XVIII. NOw, Its Pretensions are to the Dutchies of Juliers, Cleves and Mons,
as also to that of Sax-Lawenburg.

CHAP. IX. Of the House of Brandenburg.
. I. THat the most Potent and Serene Family of Brandenburg is descended from
the Counts of Zollern in Schwaben, is not to be doubted; but from whence those
Counts drew their Extraction, does not so well appear: Their Opinion seems to
be best, which gives 'em the same Original with the Guelphs; yet so, as not
entirely to exclude the Colonna's, a Family of an Italian Extraction also. In
the Catalogue of these Counts, we find Conrade the First, who flourished about
the middle of the Twelfth Century, and married Anne of Vohburg, sole Heiress of
the last Burgrave of Nuremburg, whereupon he obtained of the Emperor Frederick
Barbarossa, to be himself invested in that Burgraviate. Conrade was followed by
Frederick the First, who died 1218. having for his Successor, his Eldest Son
Conrade the Second, who was succeeded by his Brother Frederick the Second. This
Frederick had Two Sons; Conrade the Third, who gave all his Substance to Pious
Uses, causing his Three Sons, Frederick, Conrade, and Godfrey, to take the
Church Habit: And Frederick the Third, who left Four Sons; John and Frederick,
murdered by the Blacksmiths of Nuremberg's Men; another John, who succeeded his
Father, but did not long outlive him, and Frederick the Fourth to whom the
Government sell, upon his Brother John's decease. Frederick the Fourth had
likewise Four Sons; John, who succeeded him; Frederick, Bishop of Ratasbonne
and Aichstadt; Berthold, who succeeded his Brother in the Bishopric of
Aichstadt; and Albert the First, Partner in the Government with his Brother,
John the Second, and Father of Frederick the Fifth, who begot John the Third,
Burgrave of Nurenberg, and Frederick the Sixth, the first Elector of
Brandenburg of the Family of Zollern.

. II. This Frederick was born 1372. and served the Emperor Sigismund in his
Wars; by whom, in regard of his great Merit, he was constituted Vicar or Warden
of the Marck, An. 1411. Afterward, at a Diet held at Constance, An. 1415. He
obtained the Electoral Dignity of the said Emperor, by the general consent of
the other Electors, together with the Marquisate of Brandenburg, paying down,
in consideration thereof, 400000 Hungarian Shillings. The Investiture was
afterward solemnly performed in April 1417. In 1427. he built the Castle of
Coln on the Sprew; being in that part of the City Berlin, which lies on the
West side of that River. In 1420. he had War with the Pomeranians: With the
Hussites in 1424. And after that with Bernhard, Duke of Sax-Lawenburg. He sold
the best part of the Burgraviate of Nurenburg to the City of that Name; and at
length ended his days in the Year 1440. being a Prince highly esteemed for his
Power, Prudence, and Courage. His Princess was Elizabeth, Daughter of Frederick
Duke of Bavaria-Landshut, by whom he had Issue, 1. John the First, surnamed The
Alchymist, born 1401. who loving a quiet retired Life, was content (his Father
ordering it should be so) to make over his Pretensions to the Government to his
Brother Frederick; being satisfied himself with some Chastellanies or
Governments in in Franconia, and in that which is called the Land of Advocates.
He departed this Life 1464. having had to Wife Barbara, Daughter of Rudolph,
Duke and Elector of Saxony, of the Family of Anhalt, and by her Issue, as
follows, 1. Dorothy, born 1422. and married (after the decease of
Christopher, Count Palatine of the Rhine, afterward King of Denmark, her first
Husband) to Christian the First, likewise King of that Country; she died 1496.
2. Barbara, born 1423. married to Lewis Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, 1433. deceased
1481. 3. Rudolph, not long lived, born 1424. And, 4. Magdalen, married to
Uratislaus, Duke of Pomerania; deceased 1451.
2. Frederick the Second, surnamed Ferreus (or Iron-side) born Nov. 19. 1413.
who succeeded his Father, and founded the Cathedral at Coln, on the Sprew. He
refused the Offer of the Crown of Poland, in 1446. and that of Bohemia, An.
1468. In 1434. the was Protector of the Council of Basle. In 1455. he redeemed
the new Marquisate which was Mortgaged, paying down 300000 Crowns. In 1451. he
entered into an Hereditary League with William, Duke of Saxony, into which the
Family of Hesse was also taken, An. 1457. In 1461. he had War with the
Bohemians for Lusatia; as also with the Duke of Pomerania, about the
Succession. In 1470. transferring the Electoral Dignity to his Brother Albert,
he undertook a Pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but died the Year following, viz.
1471. His Wife was Catharine, Daughter of Frederick the First, Elector of
Saxony, by whom he had only Two Daughters that outlived him, namely, Margaret,
married to Bogislaus, Duke of Pomerania; deceased 1489. and Dorothy to John the
Fifth, Duke of Sax Lawenburg, who died 1507. 3. Albert, born Nov. 24. 1414. of
whom more, as Preserver of the Family, in the next Section. 4. Frederick the
Third, who had his usual Residence at Tangermund, but died at Arembourg, 1463.
Issueless as to Males, notwithstanding he had to Wife Agnes, Daughter of Barnim
the Eighth, Duke of Pomerania, of whom Two Daughters survived, Magdalen, born
145 --, and married to Eitelfrederick the Fourth, of Hoben Zollern, and Agnes,

9. Dorothy, born Feb. 9. 1420. married to Henry the Gross, Duke of Meckleburg;
deceased 1477. And, 10. Sophia, who died in her Infancy, and is by some omitted.


. III. Thus came the Government into the hands of Albert the First, who, by
reason of the many Battles he had been in, was styled the German Achilles. He
was of such Authority in the Empire, as the Emperor would undertake nothing
without him; so that it became a common saying, That Albert Governed the Empire
by Frederick the Emperor. He confirmed the Act of mutual Succession with the
Families of Saxony and Hesse; and had a very sharp War with Lewis the Rich,
Elector of Bavaria; as also afterward with the City of Nuremberg. He departed
this Life, An. 1486. during the Session of that Diet, wherein Maximilian the
First was elected King of the Romans; having some Ten Years before given up the
Administration of Affairs to his Son John, and seated himself in Franconia,
from whence, as from an advanced Ground, he might the better observe his
Actions. In 1446 he took to Wife, Margaret, Daughter of James, Marquess of
Baden, who dying in 1457. He the next Year married Anne, Daughter of Frederick

there; and Founded the great School or College, called Jochimsthal, the Year
after. In 1608. he died suddenly, in his way to Kopne. He had to his first
Wife, Catharine, Daughter of John, Marquess of Brandenburg Custrin; and after
her decease, Eleanor, Daughter of Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia to his
Second. By both Ladies he had Ten Children, whom we shall set down in the
following Order, viz.

1. John Sigismund, born Nov. 8. 1572. of whom more in the next Section. 2.
Anne Catharine, born 1575. married to Christian the Fourth, King of Denmark,
1597. deceased March 29. 1612. 3. John George the Third, born Dec. 16. 1577.
elected Bishop of Strasburg, An. 1592. which Election was nevertheless the
occasion of many Commotions. In 1606. his Father gave him the Duchy of
Carnovia (or Jaggerndorff.) Ten Years after, he was elected Grand Master of the
Order of St. John, in Sonnenburg. In 1621. he was proscribed by the Emperor
Ferdinand the Second, for taking part with Frederick the Fifth, Elector
Palatine, and King of Bohemia, and died two Years after in Hungary; having had

afterward he turned Catholic, and died at Cinna, 1665. In 1615. he espoused
Dorothy, Daughter of Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick, deceased 1649. After
which he took Barbara Elizabeth, (Daughter of Jaroslaus de Martinitz. Burgrave
of Crossen in Bohemia) deceased 1656. to his Second Wife; and then Maximiliana
of Solms, Maximilian Count Wallestein's Widow, to his last and third. By the
first Venture he had Issue,
1. Sophia Elizabeth, born Jan. 2. 1616. married to Frederick William the
Second, Duke of Sax-Aldenburg, 1638. deceased March 6. 1650.

10. Mary Eleanor, born 1607. married to Lewis Philip, Count Palatine of the
Rhine in Simmeren, An. 1630. deceased 1675.

. VIII. Of these John Sigismund succeeded his Father in the Dignity of Elector,
An. 1608. He had several Disputes, which at length ended in a War, for the
Dutchies of Cleves and Men's. He obtained Prussia of the Poles, but with a great
Encumbrance. He made public Profession of the Reformed Religion 1614. and
departed this Life Dec. 13. 1619. His Princess was Anne, Daughter of Albert
Frederick, Duke of Prussia, who bore him Issue as follows, 1. George William,
born Nov. 3. 1595. of whom see more a little below. 2. Anne Sophia, born March
17. 1598. married to Frederick Ulrick, Duke of Brunswick, 1614. deceased 1650.

And, 8. Albert, born and deceased the same Year, viz. 1609.


George William succeeded his Father, An. 1619. and, in the beginning of the
Triennial War, took part with Gustavus Adolphus; But afterward made an
Expedition against the Swedes, An. 1639. partly for Pomerania; and partly
because they yet held many places in Prussia; in which Country he died the Year
following, viz. 1640. His Wife was Elizabeth Charlotte, Daughter of Frederick
the Fourth, Elector Palatine; which Match gave Birth to this following Issue,
1. Lovise Charlotte, born Sept. 3. 1617. married to James Duke of Curland,
1645. deceased Aug. 18. 1676. 2. Frederick William the Great, born Feb. 6.

deceased June 26. 1683. And, 4. John, born and dead the same Year, viz. 1624.


. IX. We now return to Frederick William the Great, who succeeded his Father,
in 1640. a Prince of as many Heroic Virtues as Humane Nature is capable of.
Who, by reason of his great Authority in the Empire, and vast Knowledge in
Public Affairs, was looked upon whilst he lived, as common Father of the
German Nation. In him centered all that might be said of any of his Ancestors.
In relation to Religion, Devout; to his Public Actions, Great; to the many
Battles he Fought, Victorious; to the extent of his Dominions, August; to his
more peculiar Virtues, Valiant, Just, Merciful. By whom was he not esteemed the
German Achilles? By whom not regarded as the Pillar, on which the safety of the
whole Empire (in a manner) was sustained? It Is not for me to give a just
Character of the greatest Hero of our Age: Nor indeed, were I able, had I an
hundred Tongues. It Is sufficient that his Heroic Actions are fresh in the
Memory of all Men; and that the Injury of time can never deface them. This best
of Princes departed this Life at Nine in the Morning, on the 29th. of April,
1688. O. S. having Presided over his Provinces near Fifty Years. We still kiss
his Ashes, and Consecrate his Sacred Memory to Eternity. On the 7th. of Dec.
1646. this Great Prince espoused the Princess Lovise Henrietta (Daughter of
Henry Frederick, Prince of Orange) his first Wife; who dying June 6. 1667. he,
the Year following married his Second, which was Dorothy, Daughter of Philip,
Duke of Holstein Glucksburg, Christian Lewis, Duke of Brunswick's Widow, who
departed this Life in the Caroline-Bath, Aug. 6. 1689. By the first Venture he
had Issue, 1. William Henry, born at Cleves, May 11. 1648. deceased at Wesel,
Oct. 20. 1649. 2. Charles Emilius, born at Nine in the Morning, on Feb. 6.
1655. the hopes of his Parents, and all the Brandenburg-Provinces, which
nevertheless were blasted by his untimely death at Strasburg, Nov. 27. 1674.
but revived by the Birth of 3. Frederick the Third, born at Nine in the
Morning, July 1. 1657. of whom in the next Section. Twins, born 1664.
4. Henry, died the same Year, And, 5. Amalia. Jan. 22. 1665.
6. Lewis, born June 28. 1666. at Four in the Afternoon. A Prince of the
noblest Character, and worthy so great a Father. On Dec. 28. 1680. he took to
Wife Lovise Charlotte de Ratzeville; yet died this excellent Prince without
Issue, An. 1687. being much lamented by all good Men.


Children of Frederick William the Great, by his second Wife.
1. Philip William, born in May 1669. who gave signal proofs of his Courage in
the Compagn against the French 1689. 2. Mary Amalia, born Nov. 16. 1670. and
married in 1687. to Charles, Eldest Son, and Heir Apparent of the present Duke
of Meckleburg-Gustrow; and after his decease, (which happened March 15. 1688.)
to Maurice William, Duke of Saxony, and Administrator of Naumburg, June 26.
1689. 3. Albert Frederick, born Jan. 14. 1672. 4. Charles Philip, Dec. 26.
1672. 5. Elizabeth Sophia, March 26. 1674. 6. Dorothy, 1675. deceased the Year
following. And, 7. Charles Lewis, at Four in the Afternoon, on May 17. 1677.
. X. It Is now time that Frederick the Third appear, the no less happy Son and
Successor of a most Fortunate Father; to whom we may justly apply this of the
Poet.

Egregia, Insignisque nota est, de Sanguine nasci
Conspicuo, and priscas Majerum ostendere Ceras.
Fortibus eduntur Fortes, Patriumque jubatis
Robur Equis, and Bebus inest, nec Dama Leonem,
Nec celeres Aquilae generant sine selle Columbam.
Eenic. Meimbom. in Vita Henrici Leonis.
For he does not content himself with the only Glory of being descended from so
great a Hero; but has already made it sufficiently appear himself by the
greatness of his Actions, what the Christian World, and True Church of God are
still to expect from him. May God protect this Mighty Prince! May he cherish
him in his Bosom, and set him as a Bracelet on his Arm! that he may eternally
be blessed before him; that he may live, take root, and flourish, with all his
Illustrious Family; and there be never wanting One therein, who may happily
sway the Scepter of Brandenburg. On the 23d. of Aug. 1679. he married Elizabeth
Henrica, Daughter of William, late Landt-grave of Fiesse; after whose decease
(which happened on June 27. 1683.) he most happily made choice of the Princess
Sophia Charlotte, Daughter of Ernestus Augustus, the present Bishop of
Osenburg, and Duke of Brunswick, for his Second Wife, on Oct. 6. in the
following Year. By the first Venture he has only a Daughter; namely, 1. Lovise
Dorothy Sophia, born Sept. 19. 1680. but by the present Duchess Two Sons, viz.
2. Frederick Augustus, born Oct. 6. 1685. deceased Feb. 6. 1686. And, 3.
Frederick William, born at Two in the Afternoon, Aug. 4. 1688. God grant he may
one day equal Frederick William the Great.


Of the Franconian Line.

. XI. We now return to Albert the Third, elected Grand Master of the Teutonick
Order in Prussia, An. 1512. and had a sharp War with the Poles. Peace being
afterward made, he was Invested in the Duchy of Prussia, by the then King of
Poland, Ap. 10. 1525. since which that Duchy has been Hereditary to this
Family. In 1532. he was Proscribed by the Imperial Ban. In 1544. he opened an
University at Koningsberg in Prussia; and at length ended his days on the 20th.

deceased 1659.



As for Albert Frederick, their Father, he departed this Life 1603. being
somewhat distracted in his Mind; but his Wife lived till 1608.

. XII. The ancient Line of Franconia becoming thus extinct, these Provinces
fell to Christian the First, and Joachim Ernestus, two younger Sons of John
George, Elector of Brandenburg, as we observed above in the Sixth Section.
Christian, who died 1645. had the Upper part of the Principality assigned him
for his Lot, and so propagated the Branch of Culembach, by leaving Issue by
Mary, Daughter of Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia, as follows, 1. Elizabeth
Eleanor, born and dead the same Year, 1606. 2. George Frederick, born and dead
1608. 3. Anne Mary, born Dec. 20. 1609. married to John Anthony, Prince of

of whom immediately. And, 8. George Albert, born March 10. 1619. of whom also
see more below.


As for Erdman Augustus, he had Bareith assigned him for his Appennage; married
Sophia, Daughter of his Uncle Joachim Ernestus of Anspach, An. 1641. and died
1651. His only Son being,

1. Christian Ernestus, the present Prince, born July 24. 1644. and brought up
for the most part, during his Minority, under the Tuition of Frederick William
the Great; Joachim Frederick de Bluhmenthal, having in the mean time the
Government of his Provinces. In 1661. he took on him the Government himself;
since which he has given Singular Proofs both of his Courage and great Prudence
on all Occasions. In 1663. he was present at the Diet then held at Ratisbone,
and Chosen General for the Circle of Franconia in the same Year. Also in the
same Year he founded a famous School or College in the City Bareith, called
from his Name the Christian-Ernestine School. See more of the Life of this
Prince in Rentsch in Brandenburg Cederschein, page 722. and Seqq. His first
Wife was Erdmuth Sophia, Daughter of John George the Second, Elector of Saxony,
whom he married, An. 1662. but she dying June 12. 1670. he, the next Year took
to Wife Sophia Lovise, Daughter of Eberhard the Third, Duke of Wurtenburg;
which last Match has given Birth to this following Issue, viz.

1. Christiana Eberhardina, born at six in the Evening, Dec. 19. 1671. 2.
Eleanor Magdalen, born at seven in the Morning, Jan. 14. 1673. 3. Claudia
Eleanora Sophia, born 1675. deceased Feb. 1. 1676. 4. Charlotte Emilia, born

born at nine in the Morning, Nov. 16. 1678. 6. Charles Lewis, born Nov. 11.
1679. deceased March 28. 1680.
. XIII. We now return to George Albert, younger Brother of Erdman Augustus, and
his Posterity, who had his Seat at Culembach; and took to Wife Mary Elizabeth,
Daughter of Philip, Duke of Holstein-Glucksburg, An. 1651. After whose decease
he married Sophia Mary of Solms, An. 1665. and departed this Life on Sept. 17.
in the following Year, viz. 1666. having had Seven Children, whereof Three died
young: The other Four were, 1. Erdman Philip, born May 1. 1659. who came to a
violent and untimely death, by an accidental Wound on his Head, Aug. 26. 1678.
2. Christian Henry, born July 17. 1661. at five in the Afternoon; and now
Lieutenant General of the Militia Light Horse, belonging to the Circle of
Franconia. 3. Charles Augustus, Canon of Magdeburg, born at three in the
Afternoon, on the 18th. of March, 1663. And, 4. George Albert, born of the
second Venture, Nov. 27. 1666.


. XIV. Having now done with Christian the First, mentioned by us both in the
sixth and thirteenth Section, and his Posterity; it is time we say somewhat of
his Brother Joachim Ernestus, and his Issue.

This Prince had the Lower part of the Principality in Franconia; and so became
Author of the Branch of Anspach. In 1595. he was elected Master of the Order of
St. John in Sonnenburg; and departed this Life Feb. 25. 1625. having had to
Wife Sophia of Solms; of the Line of Labach; and by her this following Issue,

Slain at the Battle of Nordlingen, 1634. 3. Albert, born and dead the same
Year, viz. 1617. 4. Albert the Fifth, born Sept. 18. 1620. of whom more
immediately. And, 5. Christian, born 1623. deceased 1633.


Wherefore Albert succeeded his Father, and through the whole course of his Life
and Government, was a Fortunate Prince. He departed this Life Oct. 22. 1667.
having had Henrietta Lovise, Daughter of Lewis Frederick, Duke of Wurtenburg,
of the Line of Monpelgart, deceased 1650. to his first Wife; Sophia Margaret,
of Octingen, who died 1664. to his Second: And then Christina, Daughter of
Frederick the Third, Marquess of Baden, of the Line of Durlach, to his Third,

Sax-Gotha. By the second Venture he had Issue, that survived him; namely, 1.
John Frederick, born Oct. 8. 1654. 2. Albert Ernestus, born Oct. 10. 1659.
deceased Oct. 20. 1674. 3. Dorothy Charlotte, born Nov. 19. 1661. and married

Frederick Charles, Duke of Wurtenburg, and Administrator of that Duchy, during
the Minority of his Nephew, Eberhard Lewis, An. 1682.


John Frederick, succeeded his Father, and was styled the Delight of his
Subjects; and indeed of all others, who had the happiness to know him. On Jan.
26. 1673. he took to Wife Joan Elizabeth of Durlach, his Motherin-law,
Christina's Sister; who departing this Life, 1680. he the next Year married

12. 1676. 4. George Frederick, Ap. 25. 1678. And, 5. Charlotte, born 1679.

Augustus, born 1684. deceased 1685. And, 3. William Frederick, born Dec. 29.
1685.


Of the Augmentation of the Family of Brandenburg.
. XVI. 'TWas observed above, how Conrade, Count Zollern, obtained the
Burgraviate of Norimberg; to which Frederick the Third added Bareith in Right
of his Wife, together with the Castle of Cadolkburg, being part of the Duchy
of Mera --. The fame Frederick had the City of Creussen settled on him, An.
1251. by the Emperor Conrade the Fourth. In 1258. he bought Birnsherg and
Eginhausen of the Barons of Vaenheim. In 1261. he obtained the Government or
Chastellany of Aurach: That of Munchsteinach, An. 1265. Those of Ekelsdorf,
Wendelstein, Dchnepsenreuth, and Sniklingen, An. 1273. Those of Burckburnheim
and Dachsbach, An. 1280. Reustadt on the Culm, An. 1282. Lenckershetm, Eilbach,
and Bruck in the same Year; and Reustadt on the Aisch, An. 1285. In 1290. the
Castle of Swermtz was bought by this Family, which, till then, belonged to the
Counts of Orlamund: And the Right of Heilbran Monastry seems also to have
fallen to it much about the same time. In 1292. the Burgraves Conrade and
Frederick bought Roth, Rothstal, and Winshath. Burgrave John, about the Year
1317. became possessed of Pegnik, Erlougen, Blcck, Lindenhart, Brichsenstadt,
and some other Places; which, till then, were under the Jurisdiction of the
King of Bohemia. The same John had Ihirsheim, Thirstein, Markleuthen, Berneck,
Golderonach, Mirsherg, and Trebgast, with some other Places, made over to him
by the Marquesses of Misnia. In 1321. Frederick the Fourth added Mohnstedel, to
his other Territories. In 1326. he bought Grundlach, Bruck, and Hochstedt;
Staust and Ensfelden Two Years after: And Ansbach with all its dependencies,
An. 1331. The same Frederick siding with Lewis of Bavaria the Emperor, against
the Anti Caesar, Frederick the Fair, took many of the Austrian Nobility
Prisoners in the War, whom indeed he dismissed without Ransom, yet
conditionally, that for the future they and their Heirs should hold their
Possessions in Fee of him and his for ever, which Agreement is very well known
to be still observed. In 1336. John the Second added Culembach to this Family,
together with the Castle of Plassenburg, and Monastry of Himmete-Cron. In 1347.
he became possessed of Beissenstadt and Rudolfftein, and many other places;
more especially the City of Creilsheim. In 1364. Frederick the Fifth added
Swabach, Feuchtwangen, Emsfirchen, and Gunkenhausen, as also Hoff, in the Land
of Advocates, which last place was bought by him in the Year 1375. In 1390.
John the Third obtained as a Fief of the Empire Rikingen, Vffenheim, Libenau,
Aurenhofen and Laterdorf, with some other Places, to be held by him as Fiefs of
the Empire. In 1417. Frederick the Sixth was Invested in the Electorate of
Brandenburg, by the Emperor Sigismund, to be held of him, and the Emperors his
Successors: Which Electorate contained at that time the old and middle
Marquisates; as also Prignitz, to which he soon after annexed the Uckermarch,
by right of War, having won the same from the Pomeranians. In 1455. the Elector
Frederick the Second became possessed of many Places in Lusatia, viz. Cothus,
the Fort of Peike, Sommerfeldt, Besckan, Storcan, with all their Appurtenances;
having taken the same from George, King of Bohemia. In 1472. the Duchy of
Crossen was Mortgaged to this Family, of which it became afterward fully
possessed, by reason of its being never redeemed. In 1525. Marquess Albert, of
the Franconian Line, Grand Master of the Teutonick Order, was created the first
Duke of Prussia, which was to hold as a Fief of the Crown of Poland, that
Country being then changed into a Duchy. Somewhat before this, his Brother
George the Confessor had Jagerndorff given him, in consideration of his good
Services, by Ladislaus King of Bohemia. The same George, in 1532. became
possessed of the Dutchies of Oppelen and Ratibor in Silesia, by Right of
Confraternity (or Articles of Agreement to a mutual Succession) 'twixt him and
the Duke of those Dutchies. Joachim the First (in 1524) reduced the new Marck,
which had been for many Years held in Mortgage by the Knights of the Teutonick
Order. The same Prince Incorporated the County of Rupin with the Electorate, as
a Fief vacant by the death of Wichman, last Count thereof. In 1609. the
Dutchies of Juliers, Cleves, and Mons, as also the Counties of Marck and
Ravensberg, ought to have fallen to John Sigismund the then Elector; but the
Duke of Newburg opposing it, it was at length agreed on in 1666. after many
Contests, which at length ended in a War, that only the Duchy of Cleves and
County of Marck, should remain in the Possession of this Family; nevertheless
without prejudicing its Right to a mutual Succession, to the other Provinces of
the said Dutchies, in case of deficiency of Heirs Male. In 1637. all Pomerania
should have fallen to his then Electoral Highness of Brandenburg, upon the
decease of Bogislaus, last Duke thereof, by right of Confraternity; but the
Swedes being got in Possession, he could only obtain the further Pomerania:
Wherefore afterward, by the Peace of Osenburg, the Duchy of Magdeburg, the
Principalities of Halberstadt, Minden, and Camin (together with some other
Places) were made over as an equivalent to His most Potent and Serene Highness
Frederick William the Great. The same Prince, in 1657. obtained of the Crown of
Poland, an Independent Right to Prussia, where he had Lavenburg and Buton
likewise put into his hands. In 1679. by the Treaty of Nimeguen, that part of
Pomerania, which lies on the other side the Vecht, and was hitherto in
Possession of the Swede, was likewise given up to him, except the City Dam. In
1681. there was an Accession of the County of Regenstein. In 1684. upon the
death of Ernestus Bugislaus, Prince of Croy, all that Prince's Possessions fell
to this Family. And last of all, in 1686. by an Agreement then made with the
Emperor, the Duchy of Swibuse was settled on it.

Of its Decrease.
. XVII. AS to what concerns the Decrease of this Family; Frederick the Sixth
sold great part of the Burgraviate of Norimberg to the City, for 137000
Florins. In 1535. George the Confessor parted with the Dutchies of Oppelen and
Ratibor, to Ferdinand the First, afterward Emperor, for 13000 Hungarian
Shillings. And in 1625. it lost Carnovia (or Jagerndorff) upon the Proscription
of John George, then in Possession of that City and District.

Of its Pretensions.
. XVIII. THis Family had formerly a Pretension to the Dutchies of Juliers,
Cleves, and Mons; but it was taken off in 1666. as we observed in the 16th.
Section. It likewise laid Claim to Carnovia; but quitted that also, in 1686.
upon its having the Duchy of Swibus in Compensation for it. We shall add no
more at present of its other Pretensions, being not well acquainted what they
may be. Only you must note, That it has entered into Articles of Agreement to
a mutual Succession, with the Elector of Saxony and Landtgrave of Hesse.
Moreover, by the Grant of the Emperor Frederick the Third, it has some
Expectance of having the Dutchies of Holstein and Meckleburg fall to it; as
also the Principality of Anbalt, provided those in possession fail in Issue
Male.

CHAP. X. Of the Family of Brunswick and Lunenburg.
. I. Though the Family of Brunswick and Lunenburg, for its great Antiquity, may
seem to bear the Bell (in a manner) from all the rest; yet it will suffice us
to know at present, That it owes its Original to the Ancient Welffs: And from
whence they are descended is observed at large by the Learned Spener, in his
Sylloge Genealogica, page 476. Now Cunigund, Sister of Welff the Third, Earl of
Altorff (whom some likewise call Duke of Bavaria) was married to Azon of Este,
a Prince of an Italian Extraction; which Match gave Birth to Welff the Fourth
(or as others the first) surnamed The Strong, his Uncle's Heir; Earl of
Altorff, and afterward (in 1071.) Duke of Bavaria, by the Grant of the Emperor
Henry the Fourth. He was succeeded by his Eldest Son Welff the Second, who
assisted the Young Emperor Henry the Fifth, against his Father, Henry the
Fourth, and departed this Life 1119. having never had Issue by Maud his Wife,
an Italian Princess of High Blood: Wherefore he left Bavaria to his Brother,
Henry the Black, who died in the Year 1125. having had to Wise Walfild,
Daughter of Magnus Duke of Saxony, of the Line of Billingen, and by her a
numerous Offspring; whereof Henry the Proud need only be here mentioned, as
sufficient to our present Design, He was Successor to his Father in the Duchy
of Bavaria; and in 1137. was Invested in that of Saxony also, by his
Father-in-Law Lotharius, the Emperor. This Prince built Munchen, and after
variety of Fortunes, ended his days, An. 1139. His Son was Henry the Lion, Duke
of Bavaria and Saxony, whose Power was so great, as he was wont to say, in an
old Dutch Rhyme, Bon der Elve bet an den Rhin
Dat th alles min. i.e.
'Twixt Elve and Rhine
Is all mine.


Nevertheless falling into Disgrace with the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, he
was Proscribed by him, and so lost all his Dominions, except the Districts of
Brunswick and Lunenburg; and departed this Life, An. 1195. This Prince
therefore may be properly looked on as common Father of all the Dukes of
Brunswick and Lunenburg, which have flourished from that down to the present
Times. He had to Wife Maud, Daughter of Henry the Second, King of England; and
by her Three Sons and Two Daughters, viz.

1. Henry the Younger, who, in his Father's Lifetime became possessed of the
Palatinate of the Rhine, in Right of his Wife Agnes, Daughter and sole Heiress
of Conrade, last Count of that Palatinate; nevertheless, for want of Heirs
Male, he was succeeded therein by Otho, Count Witelsbach, Duke of Bavaria, who
married his only Daughter Agnes, as we observed above in the Palatine-Bavarian
Family. 2. Otho, chosen Emperor, 1208. deceased without Issue 1218. 3.
Ingeburg, married to Woldemar the Second, King of Denmark. 4. Maud, to
Geoffrey, Count de Perch. And, 5. William, Propagator of the Family, by being
Father of Otho the First, born 1204.
. II. This Otho was created the first Duke of Brunswick and Lunenburg, by the
Emperor, Frederick the Second, An. 1235. and had Issue by Maud, Daughter of
Albert, Elector of Brandenburg, as follows, viz.

1. Albert, of whom below in the next Section. 2. John the First, who had the
Principality of Lunenburg assigned him for his Patrimony, and departed this
Life 1276. (or as others 1277.) leaving Issue, Otho the Fourth, surnamed The
Strong, whose Wife was Maud, Daughter of Lewis, Elector Palatine, who bore him,
1. Otho the Sixth, Dake of Lunenburg, succeeded for want of Issue Male, by his
Brother. 2. William the Third, who likewise died An. 1368. leaving Issue only
Daughters.
3. Conrade the First, Bishop of Ferden, deceased Oct. 15. 1303. 4. Otho the
Second, Bishop of Hildesheim, deceased July 4. 1279. 5. Helena, married to
Albert the First, Elector of Saxony; deceased 1272. 6. Adelheid, given in
Marriage to Henry the first, Landtgrave of Hesse, 1239. deceased 1255. 7.
Agnes, the Wife of Wenceslaus, Prince of Rugen. 8. Maud, espoused by Henry the
First, Prince of Anbalt. And, 9. Elizabeth, by William, Earl of Holland, 1251.
deceased 1266.
. III. We now return to Albert, surnamed The Great, who, upon his Father's
decease, succeeded to the Principality of Brunswick; and died himself in 1279.
having performed many Noble Actions, and obtained several remarkable Victories.
His Children were, 1. Henry, surnamed Mirabilis, or, The Wonderful, who had
Grubenhagen assigned him by his Father's Will; and departed this Life 1322.
leaving Issue by Agnes, Daughter of Albert, Landtgrave of Thuringia, as
follows, viz. 1. Henry, who, in the division of his Father's Inheritance,
'twixt him and his Brethren, had Eisfeld and Duderstadt for his Patrimony, in
which he was succeeded by his Son. 1. Otho the Seventh, who Mortgaged the said
Provinces to the Archbishop of Mentz, and was created Duke of Tarento, and
afterward King of both the Sicilies, but died without Issue, An. 1387.
2. John, Provost of Eimbeck. And, 3. Ernestus, who, by Agnes of Eberstein,
had, 1. Frederick the First, who died 1404. leaving Issue only a Son, named,
Otho the Ninth, deceased without Issue, An. 1411. 2. Albert. And, 3. Ernestus,
Provost of Eimbeck, who died 1422. But Albert begot, Erick the First, who died
1449. and had Issue Two Sons. 1. Henry the Fifth, who died 1469. leaving only a
Son, named Henry the Seventh, deceased Issueless, An. 1526. And, 2. Albert the
Sixth, who departed this Life 1486. and was succeeded by his Son. Philip; whose
Brother Erick was Elected Bishop of Osenburg and Munster, and died 1532. but
Philip lived till 1555. settled the Reformed Religion in his Provinces; and
left Issue, 1. Erneste the Sixth, born Ap. 2. 1518. deceased 1567. 2. Albert
the Seventh. 3. John the Sixth. 4. Wolfgang. And, 5. Philip the Second. All
which died without Issue Male; so that Philip, who departed this Life 1596. was
the last of this Line.



2. Albert the Second, surnamed The Gross; of whom in the next Section. 3.
William, who had the District of Wolfembuttel for his Appennage; and died an
untimely Death, An. 1292. Knights of the Order of St. John.
4. Luder. And, 5. Conrade.
And, 6. Otho the Third, a Knight Templar.


. IV. We now return to Albert the Gross, who at first had only the Principality
of Calenberg and Barony of Gottingen; but upon his Brother William's Decease
laid claim to his Country, and beat out his Brother Henry, who had seized it,
An. 1292. He departed this Life 1318. leaving Issue as follows, viz.

1. Otho the Fifth, who succeeded his Father in the Duchy of Brunswick; and
died 1334. leaving Issue by Agnes, Daughter of Conrade, Marquess of
Brandenburg, only Two Daughters; whose Names were, 1. Agnes, married to Barnim
the Third, Duke of Pomerania; deceased 1371. And, 2. Judith, the Wife of Henry,
surnamed Ferreus (or Ironside) Landtgrave of Hesse.
2. Ernestus, whose Patrimony was the Lordship of Gottingen, and Principality
of Calenberg, where he had Issue by Elizabeth, Daughter of Henry the Fourth,
Duke of Glogaw, a Son and a Daughter; namely, 1. Elizabeth (or as others, Anne)
married to William the First, Count de Henneberg, An. 1414. 2. Otho the Eighth,
who succeeded him; and died 1394. having had to Wife Margaret, Countess of
Bergen; and by her an only Son, Otho the Tenth, surnamed Monoculus, from his
having but one Eye; in whom the Branch of Gottingen became extinct, An. 1463.
3. Magnus, of whom more in the next Section, as Preserver of the Line. 4.
Albert the Third, Bishop of Halberstadt, deceased 1358. 5. Henry the Third,
Bishop of Hildesheim, deceased Feb. 6. 1363. 6. Maud, elected Lady Abbess of
Gandersheim, An. 1305. And, 7. Ludger, Grand Master of the Teutonick Order in
Prussia.
. V. We now return to Magnus, Son of Albert the Gross, who at first kept his
Court at Sangerhuse; but after his Brother Otho's Decease, obtained the
Principality of Brunswick, An. 1334. and died himself, 1368. having had Issue,
by Sophia, Daughter of Henry, Marquess of Landsberg; as follows, viz.

1. Lewis the Second, deceased without Issue 1358. notwithstanding he had
married Maud, Daughter of William Duke of Lunenburg; of whom we made mention in
the second Section, Numb. 2. 2. Otho, deceased in Italy. 3. Magnus Torquatus,
of whom below. 4. John the Fifth, whom some make Archbishop of Magdeburg; yet
omitted by others. 5. Albert the Fifth, Archbishop of Bremen; deceased 1395.
6. Sophia, who died a Maid. 7. Maud, the Wife of Bernhard the Third, Prince of
Anhalt. 8. Helena, married to Otho. And, 9. Agnes to Erick, Count de Hoye.
Wherefore Magnus was the only Preserver of this Family, and succeeded his
Cousin William in the Principality of Lunenburg, An. 1368. his Father being yet
living; after whose decease he obtained that of Brunswick also, in the same
Year. His Wife was Catharine, Daughter of Woldemar, Elector of Brandenburg, by
whom he had Eight Children. Himself was Slain in a single Combat with Otho,
Count Schaumburg, wherein he had thrown and disarmed the Count; and was just a
going to kill him, as he lay on the ground, had he not been prevented, by being
run through himself by a common Soldier. The Names of his Children were, 1.
Frederick the Second, who, by an Agreement with his Brethren, had, at first,
the sole Administration of the Duchy of Brunswick. He beat Otho, surnamed
Malus, or The Bad, out of Wolfembuttel; and overthrew the Barons that detained
his Brother Bernhard in Prison. After this, being in high Repute for his
Courage, he was chosen Emperor by some of the Electors, in room of Wenceslaus,
whom they had deposed; but Slain in his way home, not far from Frislar, as he
was returning from Frankfort. His Wife was Anne, Daughter of Wenceslaus,
Elector of Saxony, who bore him Two Daughters, viz. Anne married to Frederick
the Third, of Austria; deceased 1432. and Elizabeth, the Wife of Henry, (or as
Cuspinian will have it) Gunther, Count Swartzburg. 2. Bernhard the First, of
whom more in the Line of Lunenburg. 3. Henry the Fourth, of whom in the next.
4. Otho the Eleventh, Bishop of Verden, and Archbishop of Bremen, deceased
1416. 5. Helena, the Wife of Albert, Duke of Meckleburg, and King of Sweden. 6.
Agnes, married first to Busson, Count Mansfeldt, and, after his decease to
Bogislaus, Duke of Pomerania stetin. 7. Sophia, espoused by Henry, Duke of
Meckleburg. And, 8. Catharine, married in 1391. to Gerhard, Duke of Sleswick;
and after he was Slain, to Erick the Third, Duke of Sax-Lawenburg.


Of the old Line of Brunswick or Wolfembuttel.
. VI. WE now return to Henry the Fourth, Author and Propagator of the old Line
of Brunswick; properly so called. In 1395. he reduced the Lunenburgers. In
1404. he undertook an Expedition against Otho Count Schcumburg; but being taken
by Henry of Eberstein, and Simon and Bernhard, Counts de Lip, could not
obtain his Liberty but on Promise by Oath, to pay them 2000 Florins Ransom;
from which Oath he was afterward freed by his Holiness the Pope. He could
never agree with his Brother the Bishop of Ferden. His Death bears date 1416.
and his first Wife was Sophia, Daughter of Uratislaus, Duke of Pomerania, whom
he married, An. 1386. after whose Decease he took Margaret, Daughter of Herman
of Hesse, to his Second. By the first Lady he had Issue a Son and a Daughter;
namely, 1. William, of whom a little below. And, 2. Catharine, married to
Frederick the First, Elector of Saxony; deceased Dec. 28. 1442.


But by the Second, only a Son, named, Henry, surnamed Lappen-Krieg; born 1411.
deceased 1473. having had to Wife, Helen, Daughter of Adolph, Duke of Cleves,
and, by her, an only Daughter, named Margaret, and married to William Prince of
Henneberg, An. 1469.

William succeeded his Father, and was surnamed The Victorious, from Seven
Famous Victories he obtained, The first over the Hussites, An. 1421. The
second, over those of Hildesheim in the same Year: The third, over the Turks,
for Sigismund the Emperor, An. 1424. The fourth, over Erick, King of Denmark,
in behalf of the Hans. Towns, and those of Sleswick, An. 1427. The fifth, over
Theodorick, Archbishop of Munster, An. 1446. The sixth, over Maurice, Earl of
Oldenburg, An. 1462. And the last, over the Inhabitants of Eimbeck. He departed
this Life, An. 1482. aged Ninety, having had Cecily, Daughter of Frederick the
First, Elector of Brandenburg, to his first Wife; and Maud, Daughter of Otho,
Count Schaumburg, Bernhard the Second, of Lunenburg's Widow, deceased 1468. to
his Second. By these Ladies he had Issue, 1. William, surnamed The Younger, of
whom in the next Section. 2. Frederick the Fourth, who had Calenberg assigned
him for his Patrimony; but died in Confinement, where he was kept, by reason of
his being Crazed, An. 1499. And, 3. Otho, deceased in his Infancy, 1468.


. VII. Return we now to William the Younger, who loved Retirement and a quiet
Life. In 1490. he bought Helmstadt of the Abbot of Verden; and departed this
Life 1503. having some time before given up the Governmen to his Sons, and
divided his Dominions among them. He had to Wife, Elizabeth, Daughter of Budo,
Count Stolberg, who bore him Issue as follows; 1. Henry the Eighth, born June
24. 1463. of whom more below. 2. Anne, born 1470. and married to William, Son
of Henry the Fifth, Prince of Hesse. And, 3. Erick the Third, born the same
Year with his Sister Anne, who had the Principality of Calenberg, and Barony of
Gottingen settled on him by his Father; and was a Prince justly to be numbered
amongst the greatest Hero's of his Age; being said to have overcome in no less
than twelve several Battles. He departed this Life July 26. 1540. leaving Issue
by his second Wife, Erick the Younger, who succeeded him; but yet died without
Issue at Pavia in Italy, An. 1584.


Return we now to Henry the Eighth, surnamed der Duadc, who being a Prince of
an unquiet Temper, that sought all occasions of falling out with his
Neighbors, involved both himself and Subjects in many difficulties. He was at
last Slain by a Canon Ball, at the Siege of Orth a Castle in East-Friesland,
June 23. 1514. His Wife was Catharine, Sister of Bug^slaus, Duke of Pomerania,
deceased 1526. which March gave birth to the following Issue; 1. Christopher,
Bishop of Verden, and Archbishop of Bremen, born 1487. deceased Jan. 22. 1558.
2. Henry the Tenth, born Nov. 10. 1489. of whom in the next Section. 3. Erick
the Fourth, Commendator of the Teutonick Order, taken Prisoner at the Battle of
Lunenburg, but Ransomed afterward. He died at Coblentz, An. 1525. 4. Francis
the Second, born 1492. Elected Bishop of Minden, 1504. deceased Nov. 29. 1529.
5. George the First, Archbishop of Bromen, born 1494. deceased Dec. 4. 1562.
6. William the Sixth, Commendator of the Order of St. John in Mirow, deceased
1558. 7. Catharine, the Wife of Magnus the Second, Duke of Sax-Lawenburg,
deceased 1563. And, 8. Elizabeth, married to William, Count Henneberg.


. VIII. We now return to Henry the Tenth, a Prince impatient of Ease, and a
quiet Life. In his Youth he served George, Duke of Saxony, against the
Frieslanders: He likewise assisted his Uncle Erick against the Bishop of
Hilde^^m; but above all, signalized his Courage and Conduct under the Emperor
Charles the Fifth, in his Wars against the French. In 1525. he suppressed the
Insurrection of the Boors, by giving 'em a total Defeat. He first established
the Right to Succession by Birthright in this Line. He was a Mortal Enemy of
Luther's; nor would he permit any of his Subjects to embrace his Doctrine.
Moreover, he was accused of many high Misdemeanors by the Principal States of
the Empire; whereupon he was beat out of his Dominions by the Princes of the
Smalcaldick League, An. 1543. and afterward taken Prisoner by Maurice, Elector
of Saxony; but again set at liberty, An. 1547. and at last died of old Age,
after many turns of Fortune, in the Year 1568. His first Wife was Mary,
Daughter of Henry Duke of Wurtenburg, deceased 1541. after whose Death he
married Sophia, Daughter of Sigismund, King of Poland, deceased 1575. By the
first Venture he had Issue, 1. Charles Victor, born 1521. slain at the Battle
of Sivershuse, July 19. 1553. 2. Philip Magnus, born 1522. and slain in the
same Fight. 3. Julius, born 1528. of whom in the next Section. 4. John. all
short lived. 5. Henry. all short lived. 6. Joachim. And, all short lived. 7.
Andrew. all short lived. 8. Catharine, married to John, Marquess of
Brandenburg, An. 1537. deceased 1574. 9. Margaret, given in Marriage to John
Duke of Monsterberg, 1561. deceased 1565. 10. Clara, who quitting the Cloister,
married Philip, Duke of Brunswick Grubenhagen, mentioned by us toward the
latter end of the third Section, and died 1595. And, 11. Mary, Lady Abbess of
Gandersheim, deceased 1595.


IX. Julius succeeding his Father, was of a different Opinion to him in matters
of Religion, and therefore abolished the Popish Superstition; commanding the
Julian Body of Divinity to be followed throughout his Dominions. He likewise
opened an University at Helmstadt, Oct. 14. 1576. and departed this Life 1589.
In 1560. he took to Wife Hedewig, Daughter of Joachim the Second, Elector of
Brandenburg, by whom he had Issue, Male and Female, as follow, viz.

1. Sophia Hedewig, born 1561. married to Ernest Lewis, Duke of Pomerania,
1577. deceased 1631. 2. Henry Julius, born Oct. 15. 1564. of whom we shall soon
speak again. 3. Mary, born 1566. she was married to Francis, Duke of
Sax-Lawenburg, and died 1626. 4. Elizabeth, born 1567. and married (after the
decease of her first Husband Adolph, Count Schaumburg, An. 1604.) to
Christopher, Duke of Brunswick-Zell. She died 1618. 5. Philip Sigismund, Bishop
of Ferden and Osnabrug, born July 1. 1568. deceased 1623. 6. Margaret, born
1571. and deceased in her Infancy. 7. Joachim Charles, Provost of Strasburg,
born Ap. 23. 1573. deceased Oct. 9. 1615. 8. Sabina Catharine, born 1674.
deceased 1590. 9. Dorothy Augusta, Lady Abbess of Gandersheim, born 1577.
deceased 1611. 10. Julius Augustus, Abbot of St. Michael in the City of
Lunenburg, born Feb. 4. 1578. deceased 1617. And, 11. Hedewig, born 1580.
married to Otho the Sixteenth, Duke of Brunswick-Zell; deceased 1641.
We now return to Henry Julius, who succeeded his Father Julius in the Duchy;
and upon the death of Philip of Grubenhagen, pretended to the sole right of
succeeding to him also: but that being opposed by the other Relations of the
said Philip, and an unhappy Division like to arise among 'em thereupon, it was
agreed by all Parties to refer the matter to the decision of the Law; and so
Henry at last let his Claim fall. He departed this Life at Prague, An. 1613. In
1585. he took Dorothy, Daughter of Augustus, Elector of Saxony to his first
Wife; but she dying two Years after, he (in 1590.) married Elizabeth, Daughter
of Frederick the Second, King of Denmark. By these he had Issue, 1. Dorothy
Hedewig, born Feb. 4. 1587. married to Rudolph, Prince of Anhalt, 1605.
deceased 1608. 2. Frederick Ulrick, born Ap. 5. 1591. This Prince succeeded his
Father, and had much ado with the City of Brunswick, but in the end brought it
to such terms as forced it to submit, and do him Homage, An. 1616. He departed
this Life 1634. and that without Issue by his Wife, who was Anne Sophia,
Daughter of John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg; and so put an end to this
Line. 3. Sophia Hedewig, the Wife of Ernest Casimire, Prince of Nassau, of the
Line of Dillenburg, born Feb. 20. 1592. deceased 1642. 4. Elizabeth, born 1593.
married first to Augustus, An. 1612. and after his decease to John Philip,
Dukes of Saxony; the One of the now Electoral, the Other of the Ernestine Line.
She died 1650. 5. Hedewig, born Feb. 19. 1595. married to Ulrick, Duke of
Pomerania, 1619. deceased 1622. 6. Dorothy, born June 8. 1596. married to
Christian William, Administrator of Magdeburg, and Marquess of Brandenburg,
1615. deceased 1649. 7. Christian the Second, born Sept. 10. 1599. elected
Bishop of Halberstadt, 1616. deceased 1626. This Prince took part with
Frederick the Fifth, Elector Palatine, and King of Bohemia, but was put to
Flight by the Imperialists, in a Battle fought not far from Hochst:
Nevertheless, he had afterward better Success against the Spaniard, whose
Forces he defeated under their Leader, Don Francisco Gonsalvo de Corduba. 8.
Rudolph, born 1602. and designed for Bishop of Halberstadt, but prevented by
Death, 1616. 9. Henry Charles, born 1609. deceased at Helmstadi, 1615. And, 10.
Anne Augusta, born May 19. 1612. and married to George Lewis, Prince of Nassau,
of the Line of Dillenburg.


Of the Line of Lunenburg or Zell.
. X. MAtters thus far cleared, we now return to Bernhard, mentioned by us above
in the fifth Section, Numb. 2. who, in the division of his Father's Inheritance
'twixt him and his Brother Henry had the Principality of Lunenburg assigned him
for his Patrimony; and died 1434. having had to Wife Margaret, Daughter of
Wenceslaus, Elector of Saxony, and by her Two Sons and a Daughter, viz.

1. Otho the Twelfth, surnamed Von der Heyde, who succeeded him, and married
Elizabeth of Eberstein; yet died without Issue, 1445. 2. Frederick the Third,
surnamed The Religious, of whom immediately. And, 3. Catharine, married to
Casimire, Duke of Pomerland-stetin.
Frederick succeeded Otho his Brother, and built the Franciscan Monastery at
Zell, whereunto he retired, having given up the Government to his Sons; by
whose untimely Deaths he was once more forced from thence to return to the
Administration of the Public, over which he afterward presided Seven Years,
and died 1478. His Wife was Magdalen, Daughter of Frederick the First, Elector
of Brandenburg; and his Children by her, as follow, viz.

1. Bernhard the Second, Administrator of the Arch Bishopric of Hildesheim,
which Dignity he resigned after six Years enjoying it, and had the Government
of Lunenburg put into his hands by his Father, upon his retiring from secular
Affairs; yet died before him; and that without Issue, notwithstanding he had
married Maud, Daughter of Otho, Count Schaumberg. 2. Otho the Thirteenth,
surnamed The Victorious, a Valiant and Just Prince, who succeeded his Brother,
but yet died before his Father, An. 1471. leaving Anne of Nassau, a Widow; and
by her an only Son, named Henry the Ninth, born 1468. of whom more in the next
Section. And, 3. Margaret, married to Henry the Third, Duke of Meckleburg.
. XI. Henry the Ninth, who succeeded his Father in the Duchy, was brought up

The abovenamed Henry is likewise said to have had Two other Sons and a

doubted, but that they died Infants.

. XII. We are now come to speak of Erneste the Seventh, which Prince settled
the Reformed formed Religion in his Provinces; and subscribed the Augustane
Confession. Moreover, he defeated the Tumultuous Boors with their Adherents: As

kept his Court at Hitzgar; but, upon the decease of Frederick Ulrick in 1634.
the last of the Old Line of Brunswick; and his own Brother Julius Ernestus,

. XV. Now of these Seven Sons, George alone was married; for so it had been
agreed amongst 'em, that only One should Marry; the other Six continue
Batchellors, and that they should cast Lots who the married Man should be. The
Lot fell to George, who thereupon took to Wife the Lady Anne Eleanor, Daughter
of Lewis, Landtgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt. He was a Prince for true Piety,
Courage, Wisdom, and Sincerity, worthy the Admiration of all Posterity. In the
Year 1633. he subdued the whole Bishopric of Hildisheim, together with the
City of the same Name. In 1636. he became possessed of the Principality of
Calenberg, and departed this Life, Ap. 11. 1641. leaving Issue, by the Lady
Anne Eleanor aforesaid, as follows, viz.

1. Christian Lewis, born Feb. 25. 1622. who at first had his Residence at
Hanouer; but upon his Uncle Frederick's Decease, succeeded to the
Principalities of Lunenburg and Grubenhagen; as also to the Counties of Hoye
and Diepholt. This excellent Prince died without Issue, March 15. 1665. leaving
the Lady Dorothy, Daughter of Philip, Duke of Holstein Glucksburg, a
disconsolate Widow. 2. George William, born Feb. 16. 1624. a Prince justly to
be numbered amongst the Heroes of the Age, who, at first succeeded his Brother
Lewis in the Principality of Calenberg only; but upon his Decease without
Issue, in that of Lunenburg also; as also in the Counties of Diepholt and Hoye;
yet not without several hot Disputes with his younger Brother John Frederick on
that occasion. He has taken to Wife the Lady Eleanor Desmiers, a French Lady,
Daughter of Alexander, Baron of Olbreuze in France, by whom he has only a
Daughter now living, whose Name is, Sophia Dorothy, born Sept. 15. 1666. and
married to George Lewis, her Uncle Ernest Augustus's Eldest Son, Nov. 21. 1682.
3. John Frederick, born Ap. 25. 1625. who, by an Agreement with his Brother
George William, had the Principality of Calenberg made over to him; and in
1668. married the Lady Benedicta Henrietta Philippina, Edward, Count Palatine
of the Rhine, and Duke of Never's Daughter. He was given to Popery; and died at

Denmark, 1643. deceased Feb. 20. 1685. 5. Ernestus Augustus, Bishop of
Osenburg, born Nov. 10. 1629. a Prince no less renowned in the Camp than
Church. He succeeded his Brother John Frederick in Calenberg, and caused the
States of that Principality, as well as Subjects, solemnly to do him Homage,
Oct. 22. and 23. 1680. In 1658. he took to Wife the Lady Sophia, Daughter of
Frederick the Fifth, Elector Palatine, and King of Bohemia, which most happy
Match has given Birth to a noble Issue, whose Names are as follow, viz. 1.
George Lewis, Prince Hereditary, born May 28. 1660. who has given signal Proofs
of his Courage, both in the French and Turkish Wars. On Nov. 21. 1682. he
solemnly married his Cousin-Germain Sophia Dorothy aforesaid, who was brought
to Bed, Oct. 30. in the following Year, of 1. George Augustus; as also of 2.
William Erneste, in 1685.

Charles Philip, born Oct. 13. 1669. 6. Christian, Sept. 29. 1671. And, 7.
Ernest August, Sept. 17. 1674.

Of the Augmentation of This Family.
. XVI. IT has been already observed, how Otho, Henry Leo's Grandson, after the
decease of his Ancestors, prevailed with the Emperor, Frederick the Second, to
create him Duke of Brunswick and Lunenburg, An. 1235. See at large Henrici
Meimbomii Hist. Erectionis Ducatus Brunsvicensis, which is to be found in his
Rerum Germanarum, tom. 3. page 203. Now there belonged to this Family at that
time (besides the Duchy) the Counties of Nordheim, Lawenroden, and Lutterberg,
with almost all Hercinia, vulgarly called der Hark; as also the Barony of
Gottingen; whereunto the City of Munde was added, An. 1246. In 1255. Albert the
Great made himself Master of Asseburg-Castle with all its Dependencies, having
beaten out the Barons then in Possession thereof; as also of the Castle of
Wolfembuttel, by the same Methods, having vanquished the ancient Lords of that
Place. To him likewise did the City Hamelen submit, An. 1259. which, till that
time had belonged to the Abbey of Fuld. In 1305. there was an Accession of the
Castle and District of Grubenhagen, with all its Appurtenances; and in 1311.
upon putting down the Knights Templars, it lay claim to the Town of Gittel. In
1376. the County of Danneberg was bought by Otho the Fifth, Duke of Brunswick,
of Nicholas last Count thereof. The same Prince bought the Earldom of
Wittenburg also, An. 1320. Another Otho of this Family purchased the Town of
Wallersleben, An. 1337. and the Government of Bodenleich, Ten Years after. The
same Prince possessed himself of the Town of Wittengen, An. 1350. and of the
Town and Castle of Hardeysen, in 1380. In 1388. Bernhard the First took the
Chatellany or Government of Klotze from the Barons of Quitzou. He likewise
subdued the Town and Castle of Snackenburg on the Elbe. The same Prince, by a
Treaty with the Bishop of Hildesheim, was put in Possession of the Praefecture
and Castle of Burgdorff, about the Year 1433. In 1435. William the Elder,
surnamed The Victorious, annexed the County of Hallermund to his Family, as a
Fief, void by the Death of the last Earl thereof. Otho the Twelfth, of
Lunenburg, had the County of Eberstein, and Barony of Homburg, in Dowry with
his Wife. William the Victorious purchased the County of Wunstorp for a certain
Sum of Money, An. 1646. The same Prince made himself Master of the Castle and
Government of Hitzgar or Hitzacker, An. Dom. 1468. William the Younger, Duke of
Brunswick Wolfembuttel, bought Helmstadt of its Abbot, in the Year 1490. In
1519. the County of Dasselen, and many other Pieces of the Bishopric of
Hildesheim, were annexed to this Family, by right of Conquest. In 1571. the
Praefecture of Radolffshausen fell to Wolfgang, Duke of Brunswick and
Lunenburg, upon the decease of Diderick, the last Noble Baron de Please. In
1582. the County of Hoye returned to this Family, as held in Fee; as did that
of Diepholt, with all its Dependancies in 1585. In 1592. the Castle and
Government of Gumbse were made over to it by the Barons of that Name. In 1593.
upon the death of the last Earl of Hohenstein, that County fell in; as also
what remained of the County of Lutterberg; particularly St. Andres, with the
Government and Castle of Schartzfeldt. In 1599. there was an Accession of the
County of Blanckenburg. Duke George, of the Line of Hanouer, seized on the
whole Bishopric of Hildesheim, as well as City of that Name. Moreover, by the
Treaty of Osenburg, An. 1648. this Family obtained a Right of Alternate
Succession to that Bishopric. By the same Treaty the Monastry of Walckenried,
with its Dependencies, were yielded to it. In 1671. their most Serene
Highnesses, the Dukes of Brunswick, totally reduced that City to their
Obedience. Lastly, by the Treaty of Nimeguen with the Swedes, An. 1678. the
Governments of Tedinghusen and Doweren were given up to this House.

Of its Decrease.
XVII. AS to what relates to the Decrease of this Family; Otho the Seventh
Mortgaged Eisfeld and Duderstadt, to Adolph, Archbishop of Mentz. By the
Treaty of Osenburg, the Dukes of Brunswick and Lunenburg, were obliged to
restore the Bishopric of Hildesheim to its ancient State and Government. By
the same Pacification, the Lordships of Klettenberg and Lohr, which heretofore
belonged to the County of Hohenstein, were also surrendered to the Elector of
Brandenburg, as Fiefs of the Principality of Halberstadt.

Of its Pretensions.
XVIII. THis Family lays Claim to Eisfeld and Duderstadt, as only Mortgaged to
the Bishopric of Mentz; which it likewise extends to the County of Reinstein,
as a Dependant of the County of Blanckenburg. Moreover, the most Serene Dukes
of Brunswick and Lunenburg have lately taken Possession, viz. An. 1689. of the
Duchy of Sax-Lawenburg, having a just Pretension thereunto.

CHAP. XI. Of the Family of Hesse.
. I. THat the Landtgraves of Hesse owe their Original to the Ancient Kings of
the Francks, and more especially to Charlemaigne, is generally agreed on by
most Writers; yet are they often at a loss in making out the Series of
Succession. This is certain, that about the Year 1255. Sophia, the last Heiress
of Hesse and Thuringe, was married to Henry the Second, Duke of Brabant; and
that upon the Death of her Brother, Herman the Second (after several Contests
and sharp Wars with the Marquesses of Misnia, about the Succession) she
obtained Hesse for her young Son Henry the First; whom therefore we shall here
set down, as common Father of the present Landtgraves. He was surnamed The
Hessian, and died Ap. 8. 1308. being succeeded by his Son, Otho the First, who
settled the Right of Succession by Primogeniture in this Family, and departed
this Life about the Year 1326. leaving Issue by Adelheid, Countess of
Ravensberg, as follow, viz.

1. Anne, married to Albert, Count Palatine of Saxony. 2. Henry the Third,
surnamed Ferreus (or Ironside) who had only one Son that outlived him, named
Otho, and said to have died by Poison, An. 1366. 3. Lewis, of whom in the next
Section. 4. Herman, who had Homburg assigned him, and lived a Batchellor. And,
5. Otho, Arch Bishop of Magdeburg, deceased 1361.
. II. Lewis, after his Brother Henry's decease, came to be Landtgrave, and took
to Wife the Lady Elizabeth of Sponheim, who bore him,

1. Herman the Learned, deceased May 24. 1413. (or as others 1414.) having
begot Lewis the Peacemaker, who married Anne, Daughter of Frederick the
Warlike, Marquess of Misnia, and Elector of Saxony, and departed this Life,
Jan. 17. 1457/8. leaving Issue, 1. Lewis the Fourth, born Sept. 7. 1438. of
whom soon again. 2. Henry the Fifth, who begot William the Third, surnamed The
Younger, who died without Issue, 1522. 3. Frederick the First, deceased a
Youth, 1464. And, 4. Herman the Third, Arch Bishop of Cologne, deceased Nov.
28. 1508.


Lewis the Fourth, who succeeded his Father in the Government, departed this
Life, Nov. 6. 1471. his Male Issue that outlived him, being, 1. William the
First, who having had a sort of Love-Potion given him in Italy, became ever
after weak in his Understanding, and unfit for the Government: He died without
Male Issue, An. Dom. 1515. And, 2. William the Second, or The Midling, who, by
reason of his Brother's incapacity, took upon him the Government, and died June
11. 1509. His Son and Successor was


Philip the First, surnamed The Magnanimous, a Prince worthy the noblest
Character. He was born An. 1504. and at fourteen Years old, or thereabout,
entered on the Government, being declared of Age by the Emperor Maximilian the
First. In 1527. he brought the Reformed Religion into Hesse, and Founded an
University at Marpurg, about some four Years after. He took part with John
Frederick, Elector of Saxony, against the Emperor Charles the Fifth: Whereupon
he was Proscribed; and notwithstanding he was again reconciled to the Emperor,
by the Intercession of Duke Maurice, the new Elector of Saxony; yet was he,
after that, clapped up in Prison, contrary to the Emperor's Promise, and kept
there Five Years. He departed this Life May 31. 1567. having had to Wife the
Lady Christina, Daughter of George Barbatus, Duke of Saxony, of the Albertine
Line, and by her a numerous Offspring, whose Names were as follow, viz.

1. Anne, born Oct. 26. 1526. married to Wolfgang, Prince Palatine of Deux
Ponts, An. 1544. deceased July 16. 1591. 2. Agnes, born May 31. 1529. and
married, after the decease of Maurice. Elector of Saxony, her first Husband, to
John Frederick the Second, Dake of Saxony, of the Albertine Line; she died
1555. 3. William the Fourth, born June 24. 1532/3; of whom in the next Section,
as Author of the Line of Cassel. 4. Philip Lewis, deceased an Infant, 1534. 5.
Barbara, born Ap. 8. 1536. married in 1555. to George, Count of Wurtenburg,

Of the Augmentation of This Family.
. X. WE have already said, how Sophia descended of the most Ancient Hessen
Thuringian Family, acquired the Landtgraviate of Hesse for her Son Henry of
Brabant. This Henry annexed the City of Immenhausen thereunto, An. 1280. as
also the Castle of Gudensberg, the Year following. In 1290. there was an
Accession of Eschwegen, of Stauffenberg, 1293. and of Treffurt, on the River
Werra, An. 1329. Henry Ferreus (or Ironside) bought the Castle of Konigs, An.
1350. for two thousand Florins. Three Years after this, the Seigniory of
Ittern, was adjoined to this Family. The same Henry bought the City of
Smalcald, An. 1360. In 1386. upon the Decease of Gerla^bius, the last Earl of
Dietzen, the greatest part of that County was claimed by this Family. In 1453.
upon the death of the last Count of Zeigenheim, that County also, and Nidda
fell ^o it. In 1464. Henry the Fifth had the County of Battenberg settled on
him by the Archbishop of Mentz. In 1478. there was an Accession of Butzbach by
Right of Marriage. The said Henry bought Fridenwalde-Castle, An. 1480. In 1492.
William added the Lordship of Epstein, to his other Possessions. In 1557. ^his
Family, after several Disputes about the matter, became possessed of the whole
County of Catzen Elnbogen. In 1504. the Seigni^ory of Bickenbach fell to it,
the Ancient Barons thereof becoming at that time extinct. In 1571. the Lordship
of Please was annexed to it, and part of the County of Hoye; as was also the
Barony of Franckenstein, some Two Years after. In 1600. Lewis of Darmstadt,
bought Kelsterbach on the River. Last of all, by the Peace of Osenburg, An.
1648. the Jurisdiction of Hirschfeld-Abby, but with the Title of a
Principality, was yielded up to the Landtgrave; as was also good part of the
County of Schaumburg.

Of its Decrease and Pretensions.
. XI. THe Encroachments suffered by the Family and Pretensions, which may
thence arise, are so very inconsiderable that they are scarce worth taking
notice of, unless we shall here allege the great Ravages and Devastations made
in the Principality (...) Darmstadt by the French: And it has been already
observed, how this Family has enter into Articles of Agreement to a mutual
Succession, with the Family of Saxony and Brandenburg.

CHAP. XII. Of the Family of Meckleburg.
. I. THat this Family is descended from the Ancient Kings of the Herah and
Ob^tr^ti, is the Opinion of almost all Writers, yet are they often wanting in
the Line of Succession. This is certain, That Pr^^^lans the Second, was reduced
to such Extremities by Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, that he was forced with
all Submission to demand a Peace of him; which indeed he did obtain, together
with a considerable Tract of Land betwixt the Elbe and Baltic Shore; but ^et.
to content himself for the future with the Style of Duke: In which Style he
made public Profession of the Christian Faith, and was Baptized at Lunenburg
by the Abbot of St. Michael, with great Solemnity. He was afterward Slain by a
Tragical accident in a Tournament at Lunenburg; An. 1215. His first Wise was

Woldemar, deceased 1287. leaving one Son; Nicholot the Sixth, surnamed the Boy

John the Third, who, by Maud, Daughter of Barnim the Second, Duke of
Pomerania, had Issue, 1. John the Fourth. And, 2. Nicholot the Eighth, who had
no Male Issue; but John begot, 1. Nicholot the Ninth. And, 2. Bernhard.

and Prudence in the Government of his Family, who died An. 1406. And, 3.
William, who departed this Life 1430. leaving only a Daughter, named Katharine,
and married to the last Prince of Stargart.


. II. We now return to John the Divine; who Studied 20 Years at the University
of Paris, where he commenced Doctor of Divinity: He departed this Life 1260.
leaving by his Wise Luitgarde, Daughter of Pepp^, Count de Henneberg (besides
other Issue) a Son named,

Henry the Fourth, and surnamed of Jerusalem, for his good Services in the Holy
War; in which he was taken Prisoner by the Saracens, and not set at liberty
till above Twenty six Years after. He died, An. 1302. having begot,

Henry the Lion (or Seventh) on his Wife, the Princess Anastasia, Daughter of
Barnim, Duke of Pomerania-Stetin. This Leo (or the Lion) who died 1329. his
Eldest Son's Name was,

Emperor Charles the Fourth. He departed this Life 1380. having married
Euphemia, Daughter of Magnus, King of Sweden; by whom he had Two Sons, viz.

1. Albert the Second, who was elected King of Sweden; but being overcome, and
made Prisoner by Margaret, Queen of Denmark, An. 1388. was kept so by her for
seven Years, and then set at liberty; which yet he enjoyed not long; for he
died the Year following, viz. 1396. His Two Wives were, first, F^chsa, Daughter
of Otho, the last Earl of Swerin; And, secondly, Helena, Daughter of Magnus
Torquatus, Duke of Brunswick; by which last he had Issue Two Sons, 1. Erick the

the Province of Rostock settled on it by the then King of Denmnrk. Albert the

Swerin, of the Family of Barlenleb, did in her right become possessed of the
said County with the City Domitz, An. 1355. In 1431. upon the death of the last
Prince of the -- that Principality fell to our Family as next of Blood. In
1648. it had likewise the Bishopric of Swerin (but with the Title of a
Principality) the Bishopric of Ratzburg, a Canonry of Magdeburg; a Canonry of
Halberstadt, and two Commendum's belonging to the Order of St. John; namely
Mirau and Numerau, settled upon it, by way of Compensation, for the loss of
Weismar.

restored in the Year 1534. by Philip, Landtgrave of Hesse; the King of France
furnishing the Money: But so, That the Duchy should, for the future, become a
Fee of the House of Austria. In 1547. he was removed again, and restored upon

CHAP. XIV. Of the Family of the Marquisses of Baden.
. I. THat this Family had the same Original with that of: Austria, Historians
scarce suffer us to doubt it. From the ancient Princes of Alsatia, sprang the
Family of Zeeringen, who bore Rule far and wide in Brisgow; from that, Herman,
Brother of Berthold II. Son of Berthold I. Duke of Zeeringen, had the Earldom
of Hochbergen, and died 1074. His Son Herman married the Lady Judith, and with
her, had the Marquisate of Baden; but of what Family this Judith was, cannot be
certainly affirmed: It suffices, that Henry Auceps (or the Falconer) brought it
to be a Marquisate, and that the aforesaid Herman was the first of his Family
that was Marquess of Baden, and died 1130. His Son and Successor was Herman II.
who died 1660. and left Herman III. whom the Emperor Frederick I. made
Marquess of Verona, and was the Father of Herman IV. and Henry, the Enlarger of
the Line of Hochbergen, which went out, in Philip Marquess and Earl of

Austria and Stiria. He left a Son and Heir Frederick, from whom yet Ottocar
King of Bohemia unjustly wrested Austria; on which, he got off with Conradine
Duke of Suabia into Sicily, where he lost his Head, 1269. 2. Rodolphus, who by
reason of his Tallness, was surnamed The Great: He died Nov. 19. 1288.


. II. Herman VI. eldest Son of this Rodolph, was Father of Frederick II. who
died June 22. 1333. and of Rodolph V. the Preserver of his Family. His Son was
Frederick III. Father of Rodolph VI. also surnamed The Great, who died 1372.
and left his Son and Successor Bernhard I. Father of James I. a prudent Prince,
and a Lover of Justice: He died October. 12. 1453. and had by Catharine, Daughter
of Charles Duke of Lorrain, 1. Margaret, married to Albert Elector of
Brandenburg, 1446. died 1457. 2. Bernhard, who died an Infant, 1431. 3.
Bernhard III. who was professed, and died 1459. 4. John, born Feb. 9. 1459. He
became Archbishop of Triers, and died Feb. 9. 1503. 5. Charles, surnamed The
Stout, of whom a little after. 6. George, Bishop of Metz; died 1484. 7. Mark, a
Canon of Strasburg; died 1478.


Of these, Charles was the Successor of his Father: He had War with Frederick
the Palatine, but unsuccessfully; for he was taken Prisoner, and came off on
very hard Terms. He died 1475. and by Catharine, Daughter of Ernestus of
Austria (besides three Daughters) left three Sons: 1. Christopher I. born
November. 13. 1453. of whom in the next Section. 2. Albert I. born 1456. killed
with a Greatshot, at the Siege of The Dam in Flanders, July 23. 1486. 3.
Frederick, born July 8. 1458. He was Bishop of Utrecht, and died September. 24.
1517.


. III. This Christopher I. was a wise and fortunate Prince, and died April 19.
1527. His Wife was Ottilia, Daughter of Philip, Earl of Catzenelbogen (in
Germany) by whom he had, 1. James II. born June 6. 1471. elected Archbishop of
Triers, 1505. died unfortunately at Cologne upon the Rhine, 1511. 2. Mary,

Of the Line of Baden of Baden.
. IV. ANd here we go back to the beforementioned Bernhard IV. the Father of
the now Line of Baden of Baden. He took up the Doctrine of Luther, planted it
throughout his Dominions, and died June 29. 1566. His Wife was Frances of
Lutzelberg, by whom he had, 1. Philibert, born Jan. 22. 1536. slain in Battle

. V. We go back therefore to William the First, Eldest Son of Edward the
Fortunate, who had much to do e're he obtained the Marquisate, for Ernestus
Frederick. of the House of Durlach, a next Kinsman by the Father's side, would
not acknowledge the said William and his Brothers as Legitimate; for that they
were born of the aforesaid Mary of Eicken, and therefore having gotten first
Possession of the Marquisate, so held it, till the Emperor Ferdinand the Second
declared in favor of the Children of the said Edward, and gave Sentence that
they should be restored to the Estate of their Ancestors: On which William was
made Prince Regent, 1622. And, in 1640. the Emperor's chief Delegate in the

death of his Father, was brought up by his Grandfather, whose Successor also
he was, till being disturbed by the French, and despoiled of most of his

received; and after several great Actions by him performed, made Marshall de

Baron Hoffart and Escheated to him, he conferred on them.

Of the Augmentations of this Family.
. IX. HOw this Family got the Marquisate of Baden, we have already shown: After
that Herman the Fourth had Durlach, Heildesheim, and Etlingen, with his Wife
the Daughter of Henry, Count Palatine of Guelffe. In the Year 1246. Herman the
Fifth obtained the Duchy of Austria and Stiria, in right of his Wife. In 1415.
the County of Hochberg was further added. A great part of Sponheim, in 1437.
and at the same time Mahlberg, and Lobra in Ortenaw. In 1444. Christopher
hooked in Baden-Weiler and Welschberg; and after that Rodemachern, Herspringen,
and Ufeldingen: And upon the death of his Kinsman Philip, the Landtgraviate of
Sansenberg, and the Seigniory of Rotelen, fell in to the rest: And lastly, the
Family of the Earls of Eberstein being extinct, the greatest part of that
County was added to that Family.

Of its Decreasings.
. X. THis Family suffered a loss about the middle of the Thirteenth Century, at
what time Ottocar, King of Bohemia, took Austria and Stiria from Frederick the
rightful Heir: But in the Last, and this present French War, both the Lines of
this Family have suffered, and do yet suffer: And moreover, has a pretense to
the Principality of Geroltzeck.

CHAP. XV. Of the Family of Anhalt and Saxon-Lawenburg.
. I. Though this Family be for Antiquity past all Memory, yet it was known in the
Year 524. by the Name of the Counts of Ascania and Ballenstedt: After which,
Albert the Sixth, of that House, was, by the Emperor Henry the Second, created
Marquess of Soltquel, and died 1005. But, when under Conrade the Third, the
Family of the Ancient Marquesses of Brandenburg, descended from the Counts of
Staden and Ringelheim, began to wear out, Albert Ursus, Marquess of Soltquel,
Ballenstedt, and Wolpe, was made Marquess of Brandenburg, 1142. and died Nov.
18. 1169. He had Two Wives; first Sophia, Daughter of Otto, Earl of Reneck.

2. Francisca Sibilla Augusta, born June 21. 1675.

Of the Line of Servestan.
. VI. THe first of this Line was Rodolphus V. fourth Son of Joachim Ernestus,
who in the Division with the City of Servestan, had the Lordships of Lindaw,
Coswigt, and Roslaw. He died 1622. His Wives were, 1. Dorothea Hedewig,
Daughter of Herry Julius, Duke of Brunswick, who died 1608. 2. Magdalena,
Daughter of John, Count Oldenburg, who died 1657. By both which, he had, 1.

14. A Daughter without Name, 1668.


Of the Augmentations of This Family.
. VII. WE have already noted how Albertus Ursus was, in the Year 1152. made
Marquess of Brandenburg. In 1180. Bernhard obtained the Duchy of Saxony, with
the Electoral Dignity. In 1630. Julius Henricus of Saxon Lawenburg, got the
Principality of Slackwerd in Bohemia, in right of his Wife: And about the Year
1650. John of Servestan had the Sovereignty of Jervan, by the Bequest of
Anthony Gunther, Count Oldenburg.

Of its Decreasings.
. VIII. IN 1315. the County of Ascania, with the City of Aschersleben, came to
the Bishop of Halberstadt. In 1322. the Country and Electorate of Brandenburg
fell from this Family. In 1418. it lost the Upper Saxony, with that
Electorship. In 1640. William Duke of Brunswick in Lunenburg, surnamed The
Victorious, took from it the County of Wolpe, which yet remains in the Family.
In the next French War, the King of France outed the Line of Servestan of the
Sovereignty of Jervan, and gave it up to the King of Denmark; which yet by an
amicable Composition, was restored again, in August 1689. Yet the Family of
Anhalt makes Pretension to the Duchy of Lower Saxony, vulgarly called Sachsen,
or Saxon-Lawenburg, by the death of Julius Franciscus, in 1689. the last Duke
of Lower Saxony, and of that Lineage.

CHAP. XVI. Of the Family of Nassau, and Orange.
. I. OF this Family, there are some things to be enlarged on, in regard the now
King of England, William Henry, is descended from it. But not to perplex our
selves too much in searching out its Original, which, certain it is, flourished
in the IX. Century, it suffices at present if we take notice, That from Walram
and Otto, Sons of Henry surnamed The Rich, Earl of Nassau, sprang two Capital
Lines, viz. that of Idstein, afterward called Saraepont from Walram, and that
of Dillenburg, which now enjoys the Principality, from Otto; and therefore we
shall confine our selves singly to that. This Otto, in the Division of the
Patrimony, had to his share the Counties of Dillenburg and Bielstien, and left
one Son, Henry, Father of Otto II. who married Adelheid, Daughter of Godfrey
Earl of Viand; by whom he had John, Father of Engelbert; and Adolphus, who died
without Issue: But Engelbert married very advantageously with Joan of Poland,
Daughter and Heir of Philip, Baron of Leck and Breda, who brought him John II.
born Aug. 1. 1410. who by his Wife Mary, Countess of Lohen and Heinsburg, had
Engelbert II. who died without Issue; and John III. who by Elizabeth, of the
House of Hesse, had two Sons, Henry, and William the Elder, of whom and of his
Posterity we shall speak, Sect. III.

. II. Henry, born Aune 12. 1483. His first Wife, Frances, the Daughter of James
Earl of -- being dead, he took Claudia, Daughter of John Cabillonius, Prince of
Orange, 1515. who also dying 1521. he married Mencia Mendora, Daughter of
Radericus, Marquess of Genett, afterward Duke of Calabria. He had Issue by
Claudia only, to wit, Renatus, whom his Uncle Philibert, Prince of Orange,
having no Issue of his own, adopted, and left him Heir of the Principality,
1530. Renatus also dying without Children, 1544. he bequeathed all to his
Cousin-German William; who being content with what he had in the Low Countries,
and Orange, gave up all beyond the Rhine to his Brother John; and was a Prince
worthy of all Memory. His first Son was Henry Philip William, who died without
Issue 1618. by which means the Principality came to his Brother maurice, a
well-experienc'd Prince, either for Peace or War. He died April 23. 1625. but
unmarried; whereby, having no legitimate Issue, he was succeeded by his Brother
Henry Frederick, third Son of William the Younger; whom after the death of the
said Maurice, the States of the United Provinces of the Low Countries, made
Stadt-Holder, which he managed with a surpassing Courage and Conduct: He died
1647. and by Amalia, Countess of Solms, who died in 1675. left

Four Daughters: 1. Louisa, married December. 7. 1646. to Frederick William,
Elector of Brandenburg; died June 6. 1667. 2. Henrica Aemilia, born Oct. 26.
1628. married 1648. to William Frederick, Prince of Nassau, and Hereditary
Governor of Friesland; now a Widow. 3. Henrica Catharina, born 1637. married
1658. to John George II. Prince of Anhalt. 4. Mary, born 1641. married to Lewis
Herman Maurice Francis, Palatine of Simmeren; died in March, 1678. by whom he
had two Sons, William, and Lewis who died an Infant: The former, a magnanimous
Prince, how unfortunately soever he died, Nov. 6. 1650. He was married in the
Fifteenth Year of his Age, to Mary, eldest Daughter of Charles I. King of Great
Britain, who died December. 24. 1660. From which Marriage, but born after the
death of his Father, came


William Henry, born November. 4. 1650. He was restored to the Dignity of his
Ancestors, in the Stadt-Holdership of the United Provinces, 1672. and as born
to greater, was elected and proclaimed King of England, Feb. 13. 1688. and
thereupon Crowned, April 10. following, and not long after declared King of
Scotland. He married Mary, eldest Daughter of James Duke of York, second Son of
Charles I. and after the death of his elder Brother Charles II, King of
England, with whom he now lives.

. III. We now now to John III. Son of William the Elder, and Brother of William
Prince of Orange. He dwelt in the Castle of Dillenburg, and had 25 Children, of
which 4 only are chiefly to be remembered in this place; viz. John, George,
Ernestus Casimier, and John Lewis; for from them sprang the several Lines of
Siegen, Dillenburg, Diezen, and Hademar; on each of which, the Emperor
Ferdinand III. in the Diet of Ratisbonne, March 3. 1654. conferred the Honor
of having a Voice and Seat among the Princes of the Empire.

Of the Line of Siegen.
. IV. THe Beginner of this Line, was John, surnamed Medius, Son of John III.
who had 23 Children by two Wives; but we shall first mention those of the
Second Marriage: 1. John Mauritius, surnamed Americanus; a Prince the most
remarkable of our time. He was Prior of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, --
Vicegerent of the Duchy of Cleves, and the Principality of Mindane, etc. Died
December. 20. 1679. in the 75th. Year of his Age. 2. George Frederick; he
commanded the Prince of Orange's Regiment of Horse-Guards; and died without
Issue, 1674. 3. Henry, Governor of the City of Huy in Flanders; and died first
of his Brothers. He had to Wife Mary Elizabeth, Daughter of John Ernestus, Earl
of Limburg, who died 1653. and by her, 1. Frederick, who in the Leagure of
Maestricht got the Bloody Flux, of which he died at Ruremond, in September. 1676.
2. William Maurice: He was Colonel of a Regiment of Switz, and General for the
States of the United Provinces in the Low Countries. He married Ernesta
Charlotta, Daughter of Adolphus Prince of Nassau, of the Line of Dillenburg,
Jan. 6. 1678. by whom he had one Son, born Feb. 20. 1680. whose Name yet has
not occurred to us. 3. Sophia Amalia, married to Frederick Casimier, Duke of
Courland. She died Dec. 25. 1688.



By his first Marriage he had two Sons; John the Younger; and William, born of
Magdalen, Countess of Waldeck. William was married to Christian, Countess of
Erpach; but left no Son by her, and died 1642. John went off to the Church of
Rome; and by Ernestina of Arenburg, and after his death, which was in 1638.
left One Son and Two Daughters: 1. John Francis Desideratus, who served the
King of Spain, and was by him made Knight of the Golden Fleece; and in 1680.
Governor of Gelderland in Lower Germany. He was twice married; First to
Johanna Claudia, Countess of Conigseck, who died 1664. next to Maria Eleanora
Sophia, Daughter of Herman Fortunatus, Marquess of Baden, who died 1668. From
both which, these only, that I find, got up to years: 1. Mary Leopoldina,
married to Maurice Henry, a Kinsman by the Father's side, of the Line of
Hademar: She died June 27. 1675. 2. Ernestina Eleanora. 3. Clara Chiliana. 4.
Albertina Gabrielis.
2. Ernestina, married to Maurice Henry, of the Line of Hademar: She died Aug.
15. 1668. 3. Clara Maria, first married to Henry Ernestus, Prince of Lignitz;
and after that, to Claudius Lamorald, his Brother; now a Widow.


Of the Line of Dillenburg.
. V. GEorge, as we have already said Sect. III. was the Founder of this Family.
His first Wife was Anna Amalia, a Neice of the House of Sarsbruck, who brought
him many Children; of whom though only Lewis Henricus propagated the Line. His
Wives were three: 1. Catharine, Countess of Sainsem. 2. Elizabeth the
Rhinegrave. 3. Sophia Magdalena, a Coulin-German of the Line of Hademar. By the
first and second he had a numerous Progeny; and of the third, we shall only now
reckon George Lewis, Adolphus, and Augustus, who though young, performed
Actions beyond his Years, and died Jan. 7. 1681. George Lewis married Anna
Augusta, Daughter of Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick, and died May 19. 1656. of
whom there are now living, 1. Henry, born Aug. 28. 1641. who married Dorothy
Elizabeth, Daughter of George Duke of Lignitz in Silesia; and saw living from
her, 1. Sophia Augusta, born April 18. 1666. 2. George Lewis, born June 21.
1667. 3. Albertina, born Aug. 8. 1668. 4. William, born Aug. 28. 1670. 5.

2. Sophia Eleanora, born May 2. 1640. unmarried. 3. Charlotta, born 1643.
married 1665. to Augustus Earl of Lignitz; and he dying in 1680. to Ferdinand
Gobert, Earl of Aspremont.


There remains Adolphus, Uncle to Henry, who was seated in Schaumburg; where,
by Elizabeth Charlotta, Daughter of Peter Earl of Holtzapfel, he had

Three Daughters: 1. Ernestina Charlotta, born 1662. married to William
Maurice, a Kinsman of the House of Siegen. 2. Johanna Elizabetha, born 1663. 3.
Charlotta, born 1672.


Of the Line of Diezen.
. VI. THe first of this Line was Ernestus Casimier, who succeeded his Brother
William Lodowick in the Government of Friesland and Greeningen: He was
Major General to the Consederate States of the United Provinces, and slain by a
Shot at Ruremond (in Guelderland) June. 5. 1632. His Wife was Sophia Hedewig of
Brunswick, who died 1642. by whom he had, 1. Henry Casimier, Governor of
Friesland and Groeningen, who was slain at the Sconce of Nassau in Flanders,
June 6. 1640. 2. William Frederick, who succeeded his Brother in his Commands,
but unfortunately slain, Oct. 13. 1664. for blowing into a Pistol to try if it
were charged, it went off, and so wounded him, that he died in three Days. His
Widow, Henrica Aemilia of the House of Orange, is yet living, who brought him,
1. Henry Casimier, born Jan. 1657. He succeeded his Father in his Hereditary
Dignities; and married Henrica Amalia, Daughter of John George II. Prince of
Anhalt. 2. Sophia Wilhelmina, born 1664. and is yet unmarried.



Of the Line of Hademar.
. VII. THis Line began in John Lodovick, who went off to the Church of Rome,
and was by the Emperor Ferdinand II. made Chamberlain of the Empire. Ferdinand
III. made him of his Privy Council, and sent him Ambassador to the Treaty of
Westphalia. He was the first of these Four Lines, on whom the Honor of having
a Vote and Sear among the Princes, was conferred; and died March 6. 1653. His
Wife was Vrsula, Countess of Lippen; by whom he had Twelve Children, seven of
which were but short-lived: The rest were, 1. Johanna Elizabetha, born 1619.
married to Frederick Prince of Anhalt, of the House of Hatzgerod; died 1647. 2.
Sophia Magdalena, born Feb. 6. 1622. married to Lewis Henry, a Cousin-German of
the Line of Dillenburg; died Feb. 6. 1659. 3. Maurice Henry, born 1626. the
Successor of his Father. He married Ernestina, Daughter of John the Younger, a
Kinsman of the Line of Siegen, 1650. and after her death, in 1668. Maria
Leopoldina, Daughter of John Francis Desideratus, of the same Line; who also
dying, he married Anna Lodovica, Countess of Manderscheid, and died Jan. 24,
1679. leaving by the said Countess a large Progeny, of whom yet these are only
living: 1. Francis Alexander, born Jan 27. 1674. and bred under the Tuition of
his Mother-in-Law, and his Uncle. 2. Albertina Johannetta, born May 9. 1681.
4. Herman Otto, born 1627. He was Bishop of Cologne, etc. and died July 26.
1660. 5. Francis Bernhard, born Sept. 21, 1637. Dean of the Chapter of Cologne,
as also of Strasburg.


CHAP. XVII. Of the Family of Lorrain.
. I. WE have hitherto shown, besides the Regal, the Principal Families of the
Princes of Germany; and come now to those of other Countries, where, in the
first place, the Family of Lorrain comes in our way; which, that it had the
same Original with those of Austria, Wirtenburg, and Baden, Antiquity gives us
not the least reason to doubt. For Gerhard descended of the ancient Landtgraves
of Alsatia, the old Family of Lorrain descended from Charlemaigne, being
extinct, was created Duke of Lorrain by the Emperor Henry the Third, An. 1048.
His Wife was Hadwid of Namur; by whom, himself dying, 1070. he left Two Sons,
Theodorick and Gerhard, who was created Earl of Valdemont; but his Posterity
went out in Henry the Fourth Earl, and his Niece Margaret, who was married to
Frederick of Lorrain, of whom we shall soon speak again. But Theodorick
succeeded his Father in the Duchy, from whom in a right Line are descended the
Dukes of Lorrain, to Charles the First, surnamed The Bold, who died 1430. and
left no Son: His Brother Frederick before mentioned, married Margaret, Countess
and Heir of Joinville and Valdemont, and brought back this County into his
Family: He was Slain at the Battle of Agincourt, Oct. 25. 1415. His Son was
Anthony, Earl of Valdemont, who had sharp Contests about the Succession to his
Uncle, with Renatus Andine, King of Naples, who had married Isabel, the
Daughter of Charles the Bold, which came to Blows: Andine was beaten and taken
Prisoner, 1431. and at last matters were so made up, That Andine should give up
his Right, and his Daughter Jolantha in Marriage to Frederick the Son of
Anthony; by which means the said Frederick came at length to be the Successor
of Charles the Bold: He died 1470.

. II. The Son of Frederick was Renatus, to whom no Duke of Lorrain was ever
equal for Power, and largeness of Territory: He had hot Wars with Charles,
surnamed The Stout, Duke of Burgundy: Made his last Will 1506. by which he made
his Sons Anthony and Claudius his Heirs, as having designed his other Sons to
the Church, and died Dec. 8. 1508. By this disposition Claudius had the County
of Aumale, the Baronies of Guise and Joinville, the Lordships of Elbeuf, Maine,
etc. but his Posterity failed in Francis Joseph, the only Son of Lewis Joseph,
Duke of Guise, Joyeuse, and Augoulesine, who died 1675. There yet remained
Mary, the Sister of Lewis the Grandfather, Duchess of Guise and Joyeuse,
Princess of Joinville, but she died 1687.

Anthony the Elder Brother, born June 4. 1489. had the Duchy of Lorrain and
Barry; and died June 15. 1544. leaving Issue by Renata of Bourbon, Daughter of
Gilbert, Earl of Montpensier; Francis, Duke of Lorrain and Bar; a Prince
adorned with all the Beauties of Mind and Body, but taken off by an Apoplexy in
the Flower of his Youth. His only Son was Charles the Second, Duke of Lorrain
and Bar, born Feb. 18. 1543. married Claudia, Daughter of Henry the Second,
King of France, and died Dec. 10. 1608. His Issue were, 1. Henry, Duke of
Lorrain and Bar, born Nov. 8. 1563. who succeeded his Father, and took to Wife
Catharine, Daughter of Anthony, King of Navarre, An. 1599. But she dying in
1604. he Two Years after married Margaret Gonzaga, Daughter of Vincent, Duke of
Mantua: By the last Lady he left Issue Two Daughters, Nicholaea, born 1608. and
Claudia: The one married to Charles the Third, and deceased Feb. 20. 1657. The
other to Nicholas Francis, and died 1656. 2. Christina, born Aug. 6. 1565.
married to Ferdinand the Great Duke of Tuscany, 1589. deceased Jan. 19. 1637.
3. Charles Bishop of Metz and Strasburg, born July 1. 1567. he was likewise
promoted to the Dignity of a Cardinal, on Dec. 12. 1588. 4. Antonia, born Aug.
26. 1568. married to William, Duke of Cleves and Mons, 1599. deceased Aug. 18.
1610. 5 Anne, born and deceased 1570. 6. Francis, Count de Vaudemont, born Feb.
27. 1571. of whom in the next Section. 7. Catharine, Lady Abbess of Remirmont,
born Nov. 3. 1572. deceased March 7. 1648. 8. Elizabeth, born Nov. 3. 1573.
married to Maximilian, Duke of Bavaria, 1595. deceased Jan. 4. 1635. And, 9.
Claudia, born and deceased 1574.


. III. We now return to Francis Count de Vaudemont, who succeeded his Brother
Henry in the Dutchies of Lorrain and Bar; married Christina, Daughter of Paul,
Count Solms, and died 1632. leaving Issue Five Children, whose Names were; 1.
Henry, deceased an Infant. 2. Charles the Third, his Father's Successor, born
1603. a Bold and Valiant Prince: yet, by reason of some Divisions and
Discontents in his Family, but chiefly seeing himself like to die, without
Issue, sold all his Dominions to the French King: But beginning to repent of
what he had done, and willing to evade his Contract, was forced to stand to it
by the French, who beat him out of his Duchy, which he could never again
recover. His first Duchess was Nicholaea, Daughter to his Uncle Duke Henry,
whom he Divorced, and married Beatrix de Cussance, Daughter of Eugenius, Prince
of -- after whose decease, he in 1665. took Mary, Daughter of Charles, Count d'
Aspremont, to his third Wife; yet died without lawful Issue, An. 1675. 3.
Nicholas Francis, Bishop of Toul, promoted to a Cardinal's Hat in 1626. yet
afterward quitted his Orders, and acted a secular Prince; marrying the Lady
Claudia, Daughter to his Uncle, Henry, Duke of Lorrain, which Match gave Birth
to the most Illustrious Hero, Charles Leopold Sixtus, of whom in the next
Section. 4. Henrica, born 1606. deceased 1660. having had Five Husbands,
namely, 1. Lewis de Guise. 2. Jerome Grimaldi. 3. Christopher de Moura. 4.
Charles de Gascoigne: And, 5. The Baron de Cantelou. 5. Margaret, born 1616.
married to Gaston John Baptist, Duke of Orleans, 1632. deceased Ap. 13. 1672.


. IV. We are now come to speak of Charles Leopold, the now rightful Duke of
Lorain, born 1643. A Prince highly esteemed by His Imperial Majesty, whose
General he is. A Prince, without dispute, the greatest Hero of the Age; having,
by his late Renowned Actions against the Turks, which can scarce be Parallelled
in Story, joined with what he daily performs against the French, already raised
himself to such a pitch of Glory, as will render his Name Immortal to all
Posterity. In 1678. he married Eleanora Maria Josepha of Austria, Sister to the
present Emperor, and Dowager of Michael, late King of Poland; who has born him
Issue at Inspruck, in the Principality of Tyrol, as follows, viz.

1. Leopoldus Josephus Carolus Agapetus Hyacintus, born Sept. 11. 1679. 2.
Josephus Johannes Antonius Ignatius Felicissimus, born Nov. 24. 1680. 3.
Another Son deceased before it was Christened. 4. Ferdinandus Josephus
Philippus Romanus Laurentius, born Aug. 17. 1683. 5. Josephus Innocentius
Emanuel Felicianus Constantinus, born Oct. 20. 1685. 6. Franciscus Antonius
Josephus Maria Ambrosius Nicholaus, born Dec. 8. 1689. N. S.
CHAP. XVIII. Of the Family of the Duke of Tuscany.
. I. WE remarked above in the Life of the Emperor Rudolph the First, That he
alienated from the Empire, and gave their Freedom to several Cities in Italy;
amongst which, the City of Florence paid for her Liberty 6000 Shillings. But
upon the breaking out of great Heats and Tumults between the Commons and the
Nobles, in the Year 1311. it submitted it self to the Protection of Robert,
King of ( Naples according to Machiavil) Sicily, but it did not long continue
in that State, but was afterward under the Government of the Duke of Calabria;
and after him, of the Dukes of Athens, who having renounced the Government, and
the Nobles being overpowered by the Commonalty it became Monarchial: For An.
1434. Cosmo de Medices, a Citizen, and whose Ancestors were Merchants, was
elected Prince by the Populace, Piero or Peter de Medices, Prince Cosmo's
Grandson, having, without the Senates knowledge, entered into a League with the
French King, Chap. VIII. was ejected by the Flerentines, who enjoyed their
ancient Liberty, till An. 1512. Ferdinand the Catholic King restored the
Medicean Family; which, nevertheless, in the Year 1529. was again expelled by
the Flerentines: And although the Emperor, Chap. V. seized on the City, and made
Alexander de Medices, who had married his natural Daughter, Margaret, their
Governor, yet he being Slain, the Populace made choice of his Kinsman Cosmo de
Medices.

. II. This Cosmo, commonly called the First, was declared King of Tuscany, by
Pope Paul the Fifth, in 1569. But upon the Emperor Maximilian the Second's much
opposing it, he threw aside the Title of King, and took that of Great Duke of
Tuscany: His Son Francis, in 1575. married Joan, the Daughter of the Emperor
Ferdinand the First, by whom he had,

Ferdinand the First, Father of

Cosmo the Second, who died 1670. and left a Son,

Cosmo the Third, born 1642. the present Grand Duke, who, by Margaret Lovise,
Daughter of Gaston John Baptist, Duke of Orleans, has a Son, viz. Gaston, who,
in 1688. married Violanta Beatrix, Daughter of Ferdinand Maria, and Sister to
the present Elector of Bavaria.

. III. As for what concerns this Prince's Dominions: In Tuscany and Pisa he is
Sovereign: But Feudatory to His Catholic Majesty for Siena and Massa, and
great part of the Isse of Elbe, to whom, upon that account he yearly pays 10000
Florins. Lastly, he holds the City Saturnia as a Fief of the Empire. His Power
may be guessed by his Yearly Revenues, which are estimated at 1800000 Shillings.

CHAP. XIX. Of the House of Savoy.
. I. Though the Dukes of Savoy may not improperly be referred to Germany, and
contained in the Upper-Circle of the Rhine; yet, because they are possessed of
all Piemont in Italy, as also many places in France, we thought more convenient
to treat of 'em in this place. Now this Family is justly to be numbered amongst
those of the greatest Antiquity, since little that is certain can be spoke of
its Original by reason thereof. This, nevertheless, is without Dispute, That
Beraldus, Marquess of Italy, Earl of Savoy and Maurienne, flourished in the
beginning of the Eleventh Century, and died about the Year 1023. His Son was
Humbert the First, surnamed Albimanus, Earl of Savoy and Maurienne, Lord of
Chabais and Valois, who departed this Life in the Year 1048. being succeeded by
his Son Otho, Earl of Savoy and Maurienne, Lord of Chablais, Valois, and
Aouste, Marquess of Italy and Susa, and Duke of Turin, who died in 1091. This
Otho was succeeded by his Brother Amadeus the Second (for his Elder Brother
Caudatus died before his Father) who begat Humbert the Second, Earl of Savoy,
Maurienne, and Piemont, Lord of Chablais, Aouste and Tarento, Marquess of Susa
and Italy, which Humbert departed this Life on Nov. 18. 1103. and left the
Government of his Provinces to his Eldest Son Amadeus the Third, who died at
Nic^sia in an Expedition to the Holy Land, on Apr. 1. 1149. Amadeus the Third
was followed by his Son Humbert the Third, surnamed The Saint, who died March
4. 1186. Humbert's Son and Successor was Thomas the First, Earl of Savoy, etc.
and Vicar General of the Empire in Lombardy and Piemont, born May 20. 1177.
deceased Jan. 20. 1233. This Prince lest many Children, whereof we shall
mention only Three, and as serviceable to present purpose; namely, Amadeus the
Fourth, Thomas the Second, and Philip. Amadeus, the Eldest of the Three
succeeded his Father, and begat Boniface, surnamed Roland; which Boniface died
without Issue, in 1263. and was succeeded by his Uncle Philip, who likewise had
the same Fate, Nov. 17. 1285.

. II. Return we therefore to Thomas, who departed this Life in the Year 1259.
leaving Mac Three Sons, whose Names were,

1. Thomas of Savoy (the Third of that Name) born 1248. deceased 1282. whose
Son,

Philip obtained all Piemont, except the Marquisate of Susa, upon the death of
his Great Uncle Duke Philip, without Issue, where his Posterity ruled, till the
Year 1418. at which time it became extinct in Prince Lewis of Savoy.

2. Amadeus the Fifth, who, in the division of Duke Philip's Inheritance 'twixt
him and his Nephew Philip, had the County of Savoy, etc. for his Lot: Of this
Prince more below. 3. Lewis of Savoy, Baron of Vaud, whose Posterity failed in
another Lewis, An. 1350.
Amadeus the Fifth, by reason of his great Exploits, surnamed The Great, was
born in 1249. and died Oct. 16. 1323. In 1310. he was created a Prince of the
Empire, by the Emperor Henry the Sixth. The Children that survived him, were,
1. Edward, born 1284. who succeeded him, but died without Issue, 1329. And, 2.
Aymon, surnamed Pacificus (or Peacemaker) born Dec. 15. 1291. who succeeded his
Brother Edward, and died June 1343. leaving the Government to his Son Amadeus
the Sixth, who died in the Year 1383. and was succeeded by his Son Amadeus the
Seventh, surnamed The Red, who begat Amadeus the Eighth, of whom in the next
Section.


. III. Amadeus the Eighth was born Sept. 4. 1383. and created Duke of Savoy by
the Emperor Sigismund, on Feb. 19. 1416. In 1418. Piemont in Italy, etc. fell
to him upon the death of his Cousin Lewis without Issue. In 1434. he gave up
the Government to his Son Lewis, betaking himself to an Ecclesiastic Life, and
died in the Year 1451.

Lewis who succeeded him, was born 1402. married Anne Lusignan, Daughter to
Jean, King of Cyprus, An. 1432. and died 1465. Amongst the Children that
survived, we find,

1. Amadeus the Ninth, who succeeded him, and died 1472. being succeeded
himself by his Son,

Charles the Second, Duke of Savoy, who died 1490. leaving his Son,

Charles John Amadeus, Duke of Savoy, and King of Cyprus, born 1448. to succeed
him. This Charles John died Childless, An. 1496.

2. Philip, surnamed Sans Terrae (or Lack-land) born Feb. 5 1438. nevertheless,
in the extremity of his Age he came to be Duke, and Heir to a farthing, to all
the Lands and Estates of his Grand-Nephew, Duke Charles John Amadeus
abovementioned. He departed this Life on Nov. 7. 1497. and left the Government
to his Son, 1. Philibert the Second, born 1480. deceased without Issue Sept.
10. 1504. whereupon the Government fell to his Brother 2. Charles the Third
born 1486. deceased 1553. whose Son was Emanuel Philibert, of whom in the next
Section.


. IV. Emanuel Philibert was born July 1 1428. and from his very Youth proved
himself an excellent Soldier, in the Service of the Emperor Charles V. On
July 9. 1559. he married Margaret, Daughter to Francis I. King of France, and
died Aug. 30. 1580. leaving only a Son.

Charles Emanuel, Duke of Savoy, and King of Cyprus; born Jan. 12. 1562. a
Prince (to use the Words of the Learned Im. Hoff, in his Geneal. Gall.) of
sublime Parts, and happy Memory; excellently well read in all sorts of
Learning, especially Mathematics. He had a very sharp War with the French, but
with bad success. On March 11. 1685. he married Catharina Michaelis, of the
House of Austria, Daughter to Philip II. King of Spain; and died July 26. 1630.
leaving Issue, 1. Philip Emanuel, Prince of Piemont, born 1586. deceased 1605.
2. Victor Amadeus, of whom in the next. 3. Emanuel Philibert, Knight of
Jerusalem, Prince of Oneglia, and Vice Roy of Sicily, born 1588. deceased at
Palermo, 1624. 4. Margaret, born April 28. 1589. married to Francis Gonzaga,
Duke of Mantua, 1608. deceased June 26. 1655. 5. Isabel, born March 11. 1591.
and married to Alphonsus of Este, Duke of Modena. She died 1626. 6. Maurice,
Cardinal of S.R. E. born Jan. 10. 1593. but afterward coming to be Prince of
Oneglia, he married Aboisia Mary, his Brother Amadeus's Daughter, yet died
without Issue, Oct. 4. 1657. 7. Mary, a professed Nun; she died 1656. 8.
Frances Catharine; she was likewise professed, and died 1641. 9. Thomas
Francis, Prince of Carignan, Dec. 21. 1596. of whom in the last. 10 Joan, born
and deceased the same Year, viz. 1597.


. V. It Is now time Victor Amadeus again appear: He was born May 3. 1587. and
succeeded his Father in the Duchy of Savoy. This Prince was a great Lover of
Peace; nevertheless, a new War breaking out 'twixt France and Spain, he
declared for the first; which involved him in so many Difficulties, that being
oppressed by 'em, he fell into a Fever, whereof he died in a few Days, Oct. 7.
1637. His Duchess was Daughter to King Henry IV. of France; by whom he had
Issue as follows; viz.

1. Aloisia Mary Christina, born July 27. 1629. and married to her Uncle
Maurice, Prince of Oneglia. 2. Franciscus Hyacinthus, Duke of Savoy, born 1632.
deceased 1638. 3. Charles Emanuel, of whom below. 4. Margaret Joland, born
1635. married to Rainulius, Duke of Parma, April 29. 1660. deceased 1663. 5
Adelais Henrica (or as others, Henrietta Adelheid) born Nov. 6. 1636. married
to Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria, 1652. deceased March 18. 1676. 6.
Catharina Beatrix, her Twin-Sister, deceased 1637.
Charles Emanuel, who succeeded his Father, was born June 20. 1634. He
performed all his Exercises very finely on Horseback; for the improvement of
which Art, he caused an Academy to be opened at Turin; and was so absolutely
perfect in all other Endowments, both of Mind and Body, that his untimely
death, which happened June 12. 1675. is never enough to be lamented. In 1663. he
took to Wise Frances Magdalen, Daughter to John Baptist Gaston. Duke of
Orleans; but she died May 11. 1665. After which, he married Mary Joan Baptist
of Savoy, Daughter to Charles Amadeus, Duke of Nemours, whom he left, as she
still remains, a Widow. By the last he had

Victor Amadeus Francis, the present Duke of Savoy, born May 17. 1666. On April
9. 1684. he married Anne Mary, Daughter to Philip Duke of Orleans; by whom (as
far as I can learn) he has hitherto had only, 1. Mary Adelheid, born Dec. 6.
1685. And, 2. Another Daughter, born Aug. 30. N.S. 1688. whose Name as yet I
know not.


. VI. It still remains we say somewhat of Thomas Francis, youngest Son to
Charles Emanuel I. Duke of Savoy, mentioned already by us in Sect. IV. Numb. 9.
who spent his Life, for the most part, in the Wars. Jan. 22. 1624. he married
Mary of Bourbon, Daughter to Charles Count de Soissons; who bare him, 1.
Charlotte Christina, not long-lived. 2. Aloisia Christina, born Aug. 1. 1627.
and married to Ferdinand Maximilian, Marquess of Baden, 1693. 3. Emanuel
Philibert Amadeus of Savoy, Prince de Carignan, born Aug. 20. 1628. He was both
deaf and dumb, and so wholly unfit for Business of State; nevertheless he was
married in 1684. to Mary Catharine of Este, Prince Borsus his Daughter. 4.
Joseph Emanuel John, born June 24. 1631. deceased Jan. 12. 1656. 5. Eugenius
Maurice of Savoy, Count de Soissons, born May 3. 1635. of whom beneath. 6.
Amadeus, and both which died in their youth. 7. Ferdinand, both which died in
their youth.


As for Eugenius Maurice, he departed this Life June 7. 1673. On Feb. 20. 1657.
he married Olympia, Daughter of Michael Laurence of -- by Cardinal Mazarine's
Sister, whom he left a Widow, and by her a numerous Issue; viz.

1. Lewis Thomas, Count de Soissons, born December. 15. 1657. His Princess's Name
is Urania de la Cropte, Daughter to the Noble Baron de Beauvais, whom he
married December. 17. 1682. 2. Philip, born 1659. 3. Lewis Julius, born May 2.
1660. and slain in the Turkish Wars, July 13. 1683. 4. Emanuel, born 1663.

Nov. 22. 1667.
CHAP. XX. Of the House of Mantua.
. I. WE now come to the Family of the Dukes of Mantua, and shall derive the
same from one Hugo, who married one of the Gonzaga's, a Family of a Noble
Extraction in Lombardy; which was the reason that his Son Gerhard, who was
invested in Mantua by his Cousin Adelbert, in 1009. as an immediate Feudatory
of the Empire, took on him the Name of Gonzaga. Hugo his Father died in the
Year 946. and is said to be the Son of another Hugo, who was Earl of Provence,
and King of Italy, and Son to King Lotharius III. Grandson to K. Lotharius II.
and great Grandson to Lotharius the Emperor. Aloisius, or Lewis Gonzaga, was
the Eleventh in descent from Gerhard, and created Captain of Mantua by the
Emperor Charles IV. in the Year 1329. His Son and Successor was Guido, who
begat Lewis; which Lewis was succeeded by his Son Francis; all of 'em Captains
of Mantua. Francis's Son and Successor was John Francis, created the first
Marquess of Mantua, by the Emperor Sigismund, Sept. 22. 1433. His eldest Son
and Successor was Frederick I. who begat Francis II. Francis II. begat
Frederick II. who was created the First Duke of Mantua, by Charles V. April 8.
1530. and left three Sons: (1.) Francis, who died without Issue. (2.) William,
who succeeded his Brother Francis. And (3.) Lewis of whom in the next.
William's Son and Successor was Vincent, Duke of Mantua, whose Issue was as
follows: 1. Margaret Gonzaga, married to Henry, Duke of Lorrain. 2. Eleanor,
married in 1622. to the Emperor Ferdinand II. deceased June 27. 1655. 3.
Francis II. who left only a Daughter. 4. Cardinal Ferdinand. And, 5. Vincent,
in whom the Ducal Line in Italy failed, Anno 1627.


. II. Return we therefore to Lewis III. Son to Frederick abovementioned, who
married the Lady Henrica, Heiress to the Duchy of Nevers in France; which was
possessed by his Posterity, 'till the Year 1659. at what time they sold it to
Cardinal Mazarine. His Son was Charles Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers, who became Duke
upon the death of his Cousin Vincent, and Heired all his Estates. He departed
this Life in the Year 1637. having begot Charles II. who, contrary to the
Course of Nature, died before his Father, 1631. Nevertheless, he was first
married, and left Issue as follows: 1. Eleanor, born May 18. 1629. married to
the Emperor Ferdinand III. 1651. deceased 1^86. 2. Charles III. the present
Duke, who married Isabella Clara, Daughter to Leopold V. Archduke of Austria;
but has no Issue by her.


CHAP. XXI. Of the Family of the Dukes of Parma and Placentia.
. 1. THe Dukes of Parma owe their Original to the ancient Line of the Farnese's
in Italy, from whence Pope Paul III. (otherwise Alexander de Farnese) was
descended; who in 1545. created his Natural Son, Peter Aloisius de Farnese,
Duke of Parma and Placentia. Nevertheless, by reason of his vicious
Disposition, and intolerable Cruelty, he so far incensed both the Nobility and
Commonalty, that they conspired against him, and slew him. His Son Octavius
married Margaret, Natural Daughter to Charles V. Alexander de Medices, Great
Duke of Tuscany's Widow; and of this Match Alexander de Farnese, Prince of
Parma, was born; a Prince worthy the noblest Character, and hardly to be
equaled by the greatest Men of that Age. He married Mary of Portugal, by whom
he had Rainulius I. Duke of Parma and Placentia; and Odoardus I. who became a
Cardinal. The first of these begat, 1. Alexander the Dumb, who by reason of
that Imperfection, was unfit to Govern. And, 2. Odoardus II. who succeeded his
Father; and died 1646.


. II. This Odoardus II. had four Children that survived him, the eldest of
which was Ratnulius II. the present Duke of Parma and Placentia; who, on Apr.
29. 1660. married Margaret Joland, Daughter to Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy;
but she died in 1663. After which, he took to Wife Isabel d' Este, Daughter to
Francis, Duke of Modena, who likewise is since dead. As far as we can hear, he
has but one Son, viz. Odoardus the Third, lately married (as is reported) to
Hedewig Elizabeth Amalia, Daughter of Philip William, Elector Palatine.

CHAP. XXII. Of the House of Modena.
. I. THe Dukes of Modena are descended from the Ancient Marquesses of Este,
whose common Father was Hugo, Lord of Padua, and Marquess of Este. Amongst the
Descendants of this Lord, we find one Borsus, who was created Duke of Modena,
by the Emperor Frederick the Third, and of Ferrara, by Pope Paul the Second. He
was succeeded by his Brother Hercules the First, who died in 1505. being
succeeded by his Son Alphonso the First, who, by his Wife Lucretia, Daughter to
Pope Alexander the Sixth, had Hercules the Second, Duke of Mantua and Ferrara,
to whom the Government fell, upon the death of his Father in 1534. His Son and
Successor was Alphonso the Second, who died without Issue, in the Year, 1597.

. II. Now there was surviving at this time, Caesar d' Este, Son of Alphonso,
Marquess of Monte Casso, natural Son to Alphonso the First, Duke of Modena, by
Laura Eustachia, a Woman of obscure Birth, who afterward got the name of
Labella Ferratarina. Duke Alphonso dying without Issue, left this Caesar his
Heir, by the consent of the Emperors Maximilian the Second, and Rodolph the
Second; But the Pope seized on Ferrara, as a Fee Farm of the Church, vacant by
the death of the last Duke. However, he was Invested in that of Modena, in the
Year 1598. and was succeeded therein by his Son Francis the First, who died
1656. leaving Issue, 1. Alphonsus the Third, who succeeded him, and in 1655.
married Laurentia, Cardinal Mazarine's Niece, by his Sister; of which Match
came Alphonso the Fourteenth, the present Duke, who was born 1656. and married
a Princess out of the Family of the Barberini. 2. Almerick, Prince of Modena;
where he is at present, we cannot so well say. 3. Isabel, married to Rainulius
the Second, Duke of Parma, etc. but some time since dead. 4. Mary Eleanor
Beatrix, married in 73. to James the Second, King of Great Britain; the now
lives in France.


CHAP. XXIII. Of the Family of the Dukes of Curland.
THe Dukes of Curland are Originally of Westphalia; for Gothard the First, Son
to Gothard Redlar, a Westphalian Knight, and Grand Master of the Teutonick
Order, was created Duke of Curland and Semigallan, by Sigismund, King of
Poland; and begat James, who succeeded in that Dukedom. Duke James, in 1645.
married Charlotte, the Daughter of George William, Elector of Brandenburg, who
died in 76. having born him the following Issue.

1. Frederick Casimier, the present Duke, who married Sophia Amalia, of
Nassau-Siegen, on Dec. 25. 1688. by whom he has hitherto had only Two
Daughters. 2. Ferdinand, a Noble and Valiant Prince, Lieutenant General in the
Elector of Brandenburg's Army. 3. Alexander Wounded with a Cannon-Ball at the
Siege of Buda, and died in his way toward Vienna. 4. Lovise Elizabeth, married
to Frederick Landtgrave of Hesse, of the Line of Hamburg, 1671. 5. Mary Amalia,
married May 21. 1673. to Charles, Landtgrave of Hesse, of the Line of Cassel.
6. Charlotte, who as yet lives unmarried in the King of Sweden's Court.
