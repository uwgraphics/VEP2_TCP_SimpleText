A more full Relation of the great Victory obtained by our Forces near
Worcester:
The taking the City of Worcester, and total routing of the Scotch Army.
SIR,
THe account I gave you by the last Messenger, though it was rude and
unpollished, yet it was a true one as to the Narrative of the Victory God has
blessed us with; only the particulars were wanting, which I have here enclosed.
Our men went on very resolutely, and possessed themselves of Worcester by eight
of the clock on Wednesday night, only there were about one thousand three
hundred who fled to the Castle Mount, who surrendered themselves (...) mercy,
next morning. The Mercy is highly seasonable and glorious; and though in the
Field we killed more then we took Prisoners; Yet upon entering the Town after
the Soldiers fury was over, there were multitudes Prisoners, as in the List
enclosed you may see. We hear of many that are taken by Major General
Harrison, Colonel Lilburne, and the Country people. I hope the Lord will
deliver if not all of them, yet most into our hands, so that few shall escape.
What shall we return unto the Lord for his great kindness, his mercies never
fail. I suppose we are now drawing a little nearer you. The last news from
Scotland is great also; Old Lesley, Crawford, Linsey, Ogleby, with diverse of
quality, besides three hundred taken that were making Levies to raise the
Siege at Dundee. This is in great have; but the full of all things that I know.

I am most faithfully yours, ROBERT STAPYLTON.
Worcester, Septem. 5. 1651. For my dear friend, Captain George Bishop, these
at Whitehall. Have, have.
