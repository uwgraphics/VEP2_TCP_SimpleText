To the Enemies of TITHES.
BOoks are not written for such as making their Will and their Power the
measure of their actions, esteem nothing unlawful but what is unpossible, but
for those that desire to act as rational Creatures, and will suffer themselves
to be led by Religion and Reason: And such, I doubt not, there be many even
amongst those which now find fault with the Ministers portion; Men that drive
not on their designs for private ends, but conceiving Tithes to be either
Jewish, Antichristian or Inconvenient, think they shall do God and the Church
good service by seeking the abolishment of this, and the establishment of some
other maintenance for the Minister. Let these consider that our Savior
foretold his Disciples, that the time would come, that whosoever should kill
them, would think they did God service, John 16.2. and learn thence that it is
possible for them also to be mistaken in their present opinion: and therefore
before they proceed any further let them take but this Book in hand and peruse
it well without passion or prejudice, and I am confident that they will find
their objections answered, their judgments rectified, and their resolutions
turned the other way, and as David blessed God for sending Abigail to cool his
rage, and keep him from his revengefull purpose, so they will bless him for
this worthy Knight that so happily met them in their Carreire, and stopped them
from running into that which I know they abhor, the guilt, at least the
suspicion of Sacrilege. Such effects (as ye shall Epist. to the Reader p. 21.
read) his learned works have wrought already, yea far greater: For it is
harder to persuade men to restore what they actually possess, then to forbear
seeking what they never had. Let those that prefer a good Conscience before a
great estate, read also that most judicious piece of Sr. Henry Spelman, which
has here an Apology, though indeed it needed none, De non temerandis
Ecclesiis. God in mercy bless these and the labors of other his servants, for
the maintenance of his Church, and the advancement of his glory.

TO THE WORSHIPFUL My much Honored friends, John Crew Esquire, and Richard
Knightley Esquire, worthy Patriots of our Country Northamptonshire.
I Address unto you both, these several Treatises, not only out of duty and
obligations to your selves, but in regard of your public good affection to
maintain the patrimony of the Church in Tithes, which is so fundamentally
settled by our Laws, that nothing can be more certain by them. And the times now
growing dangerous to the whole state of the Clergy in this particular, your
selves having declared your opinions for Tithes, and accordingly been careful
to preserve us in our rights, I hope this my service will be acceptable to you:
what farther may be done depends upon Gods providence, and the good endeavors
of all pious men to afford their best assistance. Seeing the Parliament has
honorably declared themselves for Tithes, both by their Ordinance and the
repulse given to some Petitioners against them. For mine own part, though I
expect censure and opposition from many, yet as an Ancient said, In causa qua
Deo placere cupio, homines non formido. I have therefore in this needful time,
at the earnest request of many, adventured the rather to discharge the trust
reposed in me by the worthy Knight Sir Hen. Sp. who being employed in greater
works, committed these to my care and trust to be published. His charge does
nearly concern me, and in conscience I could not longer conceal them from the
public view. They have been long in my custody; and if the favor of your
self M. Crew, in a time of danger, besides M. Knightleys public deserts and
defense of me since from scandalous people, had not prevented, they had been
utterly lost by the injury of soldiers, together with other Manuscripts and
Monuments of great consequence against the common adversary. Your selves having
preserved them and me, I could not do otherwise then return you the thanks and
fruit of your own favors; and whosoever shall think these worthy the public
view, will have the like cause to render you thanks for saving both them and my
self, being extremely injured by some that are styled in our ancient Laws, Ll.
H. 1. c. 29.
Villani, Cocseti, Perdingi, viles and inopes personae; by whose troubles I am
enforced to omit diverse additions material to this argument, which the learned
Knight committed to me. But lest hereafter they should miscarry by any common
danger, or neglect of mine, I could find no better means to prevent the same,
then by committing these to the Press, that they may live and be extant for
the common benefit of Gods cause and Church. The piety, excellent learning and
moderation of the Author, all his expressions, will prevail much with those
that are truly wise and sober, and if your protection shall concur to defend
both them and my poor studies, I shall hope to give you farther account
hereafter in other works of great moment. Thus praying God to guide and bless
you in all your pious endeavors, I subscribe my self,

Yours ever obliged, JER. STEPHENS.

To the READER.
THe eminent worth and dignity of this religious Knight needs not to be set
forth by the praise or pen of any man; his excellent learning, piety, and
wisdom, were very well known to the best living in his time; and his own
works published in his life, together with the great applause conferred on
them, both at home and in forain parts by learned noble Parsonages, and great
Princes, are testimonies beyond all denial, or exception. Among all other his
singular deserts and works, there is none more illustrious, then his piety
toward God, testified both in his holy course of life, and especially by his
learned and godly Treatises, of the Rights and Respect due to Churches. Wherein
he has so accuratly proved, what is due to God, and to be rendered unto him,
both for the time of his worship, and also for the means and places, wherein
his worship is to be performed, that no true Christian, who embraces the
Gospel, but must acknowledge willingly his singular deserts and piety: His
great knowledge in the Common Law of our Kingdom, and all other Laws
whatsoever, divine or humane, ancient or modern, Civil or Canonical,

-- Multatenens antiqua, sepulta, vetusta, Eunius.
Quae faciunt mores veteresque novosque tenentem, renders him singularly
judicious above many other, and able to deliver the truth when he descends to
speak of humane laws and authorities, after he had first founded and settled his
opinion upon the divine Law of God. Yet notwithstanding his piety, learning,
and moderation in all his expressions, there wanted not a perverse spirit to
oppose and scribble something against him, whereof he took notice, and added
a censure in his learned work the Glossary; and also among other his papers of
this argument, he has left a sufficient apology and justification of his
former Treatise, which is here published for satisfaction to all that be truly
pious and well-affected sons of the Church of England.

For his larger work of Tithes, which he prepared long ago, it is also here
added, though in some few places imperfect, and might have been better polished
by his own hand, if he had engaged himself upon it, and desisted from his
greater works so much desired by many eminently learned both at home and
abroad: yet rather then suffer the loss of such a testimony of his piety to
God, and good affection to uphold the settled maintenance of Gods House and
Ministers, to whom double honor is due, Tim. 1.15.
as the Apostle says, it is thought fit to publish it, as he left it,
imperfect in some passages, and defective of such ornaments and arguments, as
he could have added further, out of his store and abundance: though what he
has here delivered is so complete, as does fully discover the ability of his
judgment; and that these reasons and illustrations produced by him could
hardly have proceeded from any other Author, being agreeable to his
expressions, style, and arguments delivered in his other writings. And at this
instant it seems very necessary, in regard the humor and displeasure of many
in the world, is now obstinately bent to beat down, root up, overthrow, and
destroy, whatsoever the piety and wisdom of our forefathers built and
contributed in the Primitive times of their faith and conversion to
Christianity, as if all they did, were Popish and superstitious, fit to be
rooted up: and as if themselves had a Commission as large as the great Prophet
had from God, and were set over the Nations and Kingdoms, to root out, and
pull down, to destroy and to throw down, to build and to plant, Jer. 1.10.

But if men will rest satisfied, either with proof from divine authority, there
wants not enough here to guide their consciences: or with humane Laws and
Statutes confirmed, and fully enacted by many Parliaments, whereby they are now
become ancient and fundamental, as well as any other Laws, together with the
constant course and practice of above a thousand years in our Commonwealth,
there wants not here the testimony of all our ancient Monuments, Statutes,
Deeds, and Charters of our Kingdom, Princes, and Noble men, which this learned
Knight has more fully and completely published in order of time, and in their
original Saxon-language, in his first Tome of our English Laws and Councels,
for the first five hundred years before the Conquest, being his last work
before his death. Whereunto when the second Tome (which he has also finished)
shall be added for the next 500. years after the Conquest, together with his
learned Commentary upon all difficult and ancient rites and customs; there
will be abundant proof from all humane Laws, and the authority of our Common
Law, together with the practice of our Kingdom, in several ages, that no man
can raise a doubt or exception, that shall not receive satisfaction fully and
clearly. As for the Laws of Israel, and the Heathens also in imitation of Gods
own people, the Decrees and Canons of general Councels, in succeeding times,
here is also such abundant testimony produced, that no judicious Reader can
refuse to yield his vote thereto, and approbation for continuance.

There is another noble and religious Knight of Scotland, Sir James Sempil, who
has so accurately labored in this argument, and proved the divine right of
Tithes from the holy Scriptures, insisting thereupon only, and no other humane
Authorities, or Antiquities, further then he finds the^ to play upon the Text,
pro or contra, (as himself says in his Preface) that much satisfaction may be
received from his pious endeavors; having therein cleared some Texts of
Scripture from sinister interpretations, and exactly considered the first
Institution and Laws for Tithes, delivered by God himself both in the Old and
New Testaments.

If both these godly and learned witnesses of the truth will not serve the turn
to convince the judgment of some ill-affected, they being both raised up by
God out of both Nations, Numb. 11.26.
like to Eldad and Medad, among the people, extraordinarily to prophecy, and
defend the truth, being moved and inspired doubtless by God himself, (besides
those that belong to the Tabernacle) to uphold and maintain his own cause
against the adversaries of his Church; yet they may well stop the mouths of
worldlings and Mammonists from clamor and inveighing, and persuade them to
acquiesce upon the known and fundamental Laws of the Kingdom: which are as
ancient and fundamental as any other, or rather more, because they concern
especially the upholding and maintenance of the worship of God, then which
nothing can be more necessary or fundamental: and therefore the pious and good
King Edward the Confessor, does begin his Laws with the recital and
confirmation of the Ecclesiastical Laws, and particularly of Tithes,
Church-possessions, and Liberties thereof: ^l ad confess. ^n Prooem.
A legibus igitur sanctae matris Ecclesiae sumentes exordium, quoniam per eam
Rex and regnum solidum habent subsistendi fundamentum, leges, libertates, and
pacem ipsius concionati sunt. Because thereby the King and Kingdom have their
solid foundation for subsistence, therefore the laws, liberties, and peace
thereof are first proclaimed and established.

And thus begins also Magna Charta, -- Nos intuitu Dei, pro salute animae
nostrae, ad exaltationem sanctae Ecclesiae, etc. and so also many other
Statutes successively, pour le common profit de Saint Esglise and del Realm,
Westminst. 1.
etc.

The possessions, tithes, and rights of the Clergy being thus settled, they may
doubtless be enjoyed, having been freely collated (according as was foretold
by the Prophets, Esaias and others) by Kings, Nobles, and many good men, Esaias
49.23.
fully confirmed by Law and Parliament, If these things had not been primarily
due unto God, by the rule of his Word, yet are they now his, and separate from
us, by the voluntary gift and dedication of our ancient Kings and Predecessors.
established by the possession of many hundred years: and that although in the
beginning perhaps things were not so commanded in particular, as any man else
may enjoy lands, goods, chattels, gifts and grants whatsoever is freely
collated, purchased, or obtained by industry, or is freely given and bequeathed
by Ancestors, or other Benefactors, although perhaps there be not divine right
in special, to prove and justify so much land, money, rents, or goods of any
sort to be his due and right.

God did foretell and promise by the Prophet Esaias, Spelmans first Treatise, 5.
and cap. 28. inf.
cap. 49.23. that he would raise up in the Church of the redeemed, Kings and
Queens to be nursing fathers, and nursing mothers to his Church; that is, says
Calvin upon the Text, Magni Reges ac principes non solum Christi jugum
subierunt, sed etiam facultates suas contulerunt, ad erigendam and fovendam
Christi Ecclesiam, ita ut se patronos and tutores ejus praestarent. Kings and
Princes should give much Lands, Revenues, and great maintenance for the worship
of God, and his Ministers, attending thereon, which promise God abundantly
performed by many and great Emperors, Kings, and Princes in all Countries
after their conversion to the faith.

The donations, gifts, and buildings of Constantine the first, and great
Christian Emperor born at York, and Helena his mother an English Lady,
exceeding religious and devout, are famous in History, together with their
buildings and endowing of many ample and beautiful Churches in several
Counties of the Empire. Dominicum aureum. Nobilissimum Antiochiae templum a
Constantino M. inceptum, sub Constantio vero absolutum; and hoc epitheto prae
excellentia honoratum; insigni. Episcoporum populorumque confluentia ejus

dedicatur. Glossar. Spelman. pa. 224.

Cyrill describing a Church of Constantines building in Jerusalem, calls it, (
Cat. 14.) (...), a Church all adorned, and embossed with silver and gold.

Eusebius reporting of the spacious and beautiful Church of Tire, which was
built anew by the famous B. P. Paulinus says, the luster and splendor was
such, (...), as made beholders amazed to behold it.


Neither did he thus alone in his own person, but he also gave leave to his
subjects to do the like, whereby the Church was greatly enriched in a short
time. C. L. 1. c. de sacrosanct. Ecclesiis, Si quis authent. de Ecclesia.

The gifts and buildings of diverse other Emperors and Kings, as Theodosius,
Justinian, Pipin, and Charles the great are endless to be repeated. When as
any does the like now, or repair old Churches formerly built, he is by some
ignorant people termed Popish, or Popish affected.

The grants, buildings, and gifts of our own English Kings, Noble men, and
Bishops, ever since our first conversion, are famous in our Histories:
especially of King Lucius, and Ethelbert, the two first of the British and
Saxon Kings: so also of Egbert, Alured, Ethelwolph, Edgar, Edward the
Confessor, and many others in times following after the Conquest, (no Princes,
or Nobles, being more bountiful then ours in England.) Their Charters and Acts
of Parliament are extant in the first Tome of our Councels by this Author; and
many are also mentioned by the learned Seldom in his History. Now when Churches
are built, and grants of lands, tithes, and oblations are freely given by great
Kings, confirmed by several Acts of Parliament, oftentimes renewed and
reiterated, as by the great Charter thirty times confirmed, and many other
Statutes since, as also by the Text and body of the Common Law, which does
affirm Tithes to be due Jure divino: as is asserted by that ever honorable
Judge and Oracle of Law, the Lord Coke, in the second part of his Reports,
L'Evesque de Winchester case, fol. 45.
Dismes sont chooses spirituels, and due, de jure divino.

Being thus settled and confirmed, and thereby becoming fundamental Laws of
the Kingdom, they may, and ought to be enjoyed peaceably, without grudging, or
repining, alienation or spoil, without casting an evil eye upon Gods
allowance, and because he has given the flower of wheat to make bread for his
Sanctuary: whereof God himself gives charge in the last vision of Ezekiel,
Ezekiel. 45, etc.
contained in the last four chapters, where he appoints a third part of the
land to be set forth for his Temple, Priests, and servants, besides the
portions for the Prince, and for the people; which vision for performance
concerns the Christian Church, and was never fulfilled in the Jewish State,
as this Author and many others do show: and there God does especially forbid
alienation, selling or exchanging of his Temples portion, as being most holy
unto the Lord, Ezekiel. 48.14.

It concerns us therefore that live in these times of the Christian Church,
when we see the ancient prophecy fulfilled by Kings and Princes, in giving
much to the Church, to preserve Gods portion entire without alienation, spoil,
or violence. The Primitive times of the Church, as this Author shows, chapter 6.
as had not been since the very Creation: times wherein God opened the windows
of persecution, and rained blood upon his Church, as he did water upon the
world in the days of Noah, during the ten grievous persecutions in the first
300. years after Christ, so that no man must expect then to find settled Laws
for Tithes, Lands, or maintenance of the Clergy, when the Emperors and
Magistrates were Heathens persecuting the Church, and made many furious edicts
for rasing and ruinating of Churches, which had been built by Christians in
some times of intermission, as appears by Eusebius, when he comes to the times
of Dioclesian. Every good Christian, and almost every Clergyman, lost his life
for religion; no man did care or expect for preferment, maintenance, or
dignity, save only the crown of martyrdom, which many thousands did obtain:
Cap. 6.
The Church, says this Author, did all that while expose the dugs of her piety
unto others, but did live her self on thistles and thorns, in great want
oftentimes, necessity, and professed poverty. Now those men that would reform
all according to the pattern of the Primitive Church, and the Apostolical
times, do not consider, that the Clergy must be reduced again to the same
condition of poverty, want, and misery, as formerly they were, if the pious and
charitable gifts, and donations of Kings and Nobles, in the ages next
succeeding the persecutions, should be taken away, and the ancient patrimony of
Tithes abated, or subverted by the worldly and covetous practices of them that
esteem gain to be godliness. The kytes of Satan (as this Author terms
them) have already pulled away many a plume from the Church in several ages,
yet thanks be to God, there be some feathers left to keep her from shame and
nakedness, if the sacrilegious humor of the times prevail not against her.
And there is the more reason to hope and expect that we may enjoy our portion
and tithes quietly, because we have so much less then the old Priests and
Levites received from the people: for they had several tithes and oblations
for themselves, for the feasts and for the poor, wherein they did share in a
far greater proportion then is now required by the Clergy of the Gospel.

The learned Scaliger, Seldom, and many others do prove apparently by instance
of particulars, that the Israelites did pay out of their increase of corn much
more then a tenth, even almost a fifth part for several tithes and duties then
commanded to them. I will recite Mr Seldens example, History ca. 2. 4.

The Husband-ma^ had growing, 6000 Bushels in one year. 100 Bushels was the
least that could be paid by the husbandman to the Priests for the first fruits
of the threshing floor. 5900 Bushels remained to the husbandman, out of which
he paid two tithes. 590 Bushels were the first Tithe paid to the Levites. 59
Bushels the Levites paid the Priests, which was called the Tithe of the Tithes.
5310 Bushels remained to the husbandman, out of which he paid his second
Tithe. 531 Bushels were the second Tithe. 4779 Bushels remained to the
husbandman, as his own, all being paid. 1121 Bushels are the sum of both
Tithes joined together, which is above a sixth part of the whole, namely,
nineteen out of an hundred.

So that of six thousand bushels the Levites had in all 1063. whole to
themselves: the Priests 159, and the husbandman only 4779. He yearly thus
paid more then a sixth part of his increase, besides first fruits, almost a
fifth: many of no small name, grossly skip in reckoning these kinds of their
Tithes, says Mr Seldom. Observe how much (says Chrysostom, In Epist. ad
Philip. Tom. 4. Edit. Savil.
speaking of the great maintenance of the Levites) the Jews gave to their
Priests and Levites, as tenths, first fruits, then tenths again: then other
tenths, and again, other thirtieths, and the sicle, and yet no man said, they
eat, or had too much.

The Rabbis also reckon 24. gifts to the Priesthood, according as they are set
down both by Rabbi Bechai, and R. Chaskoni, on Numb. 18. and so Jarchi on Genesis
29.34. and in Talmud. in the Massech, Cholin. 133. f. 2. page in this order: i.
The twenty four gifts of the Priesthood were given to the Priests, twelve at
Jerusalem, and twelve in the borders: the twelve that were given in Jerusalem,
are these, the sin-offering, the trespasse-offering, the peace offerings of the
Congregation, the skins of the holy things, the shewbread, the two loaves, the
omer, or sheaf, the remainder of the meat offerings, the residue of the log, or
pint of oil for the Leper, the oblation of the thanksgiving, the oblation of
the peace offering, the oblation of the Ram of the Nazarite. And these
following are the twelve that were given in the borders: the great
heave offering, the heave offering, or oblation of the tithe, the cake, the
first fruits, the first of the fleece, the shoulder, the two cheeks and the
maw, the firstborn of man, the firstborn of the clean beast, the firstling of
the Ass, the dedications or vows, the field of possession, the robbery of the
stranger, Lev. 6.5. Numb. 5.7, 8. These are the 24. gifts that belonged to the
Priesthood. But among these, there is no mention of the firstborn of any
unclean beast, but only the Ass, and no mention at all of the tithe of
cattle. M. Nettles, page 120.
Thus a learned Author observes out of the Rabbis.

All these several tithes, oblations and duties were paid, not deducting nor
accounting their charges and labor of the husbandman; and yet they among their
aphorisms both divine and moral, do tell us, that as the Masoreth is the
defense of the Law: so (...), Maighsheroth seag Laighsher, that is, tithes paid
are the defense of riches: so God promised, Mal. 3. Bring ye all the tithes
into the Storehouse, that there may be meat in my house, and prove me
herewith, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of
heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to
receive it.

And one notes, that at this day, when they have no Temple, nor Priesthood: Qui
religiosiores sunt inter Judaeos, loco decimarum, eleemosynam pendunt de
omnibus lucris december aureos de centum, centum de mill: as Mr Seldom observes
in his Review, cap. 2.

Yea, they paid not only their tithes, but their first fruits also, wherein
they were so liberal in some ages, that even from the abundance of
first fruits paid by the owners to the Priests, there was not a Priest in the
24. courses of them, but might be accounted a very rich, or largely furnished
man; as Mr Seldom observes out of Philo: and that they prevented the officers
in demanding of them, paid them before they were due by Law, as if they had
rather taken a benefit then given any; both sexes of their own most foreward
readiness in every first-fruit season, brought them in with such courtesy,
and thanksgiving, as is beyond all expression; whereas in these times under the
Gospel the Priesthood is far more excellent then that of the Law, and the
Clergy deserves infinitely more then the old Priests and Levites: whose
employment is not to light candles, snuff lamps, set bread upon the table,
kindle fire, put incense at the Altar, to kill, slay, and hew beasts in pieces,
but have incumbent onus, even Angelis formidabile, if men would rightly
understand what they undergo, or others value what these sustain. They have
(...) of the souls of men, which is an office no temporal satisfaction can
countervail: accountable to God for themselves and others. Their study, labors,
after long and chargeable education, in reading, watching, preaching, praying,
visiting the sick, are fully expressed by this learned Author, cap. 14. Yet the
husbandman pays now but one tenth to the Clergy, and no particular tithe for
feasts, or to the poor, or other uses, as the Israelites did. Decimae Philippo
Regi Francorum in oppugnatiotem Saladani Mahometani principis concessae erant.

But the Clergy now besides out of their small receipts, bear the burden of
tenths and first fruits to the value of thirty thousand pounds yearly, imposed
on them lately, whereas tenths were not annually paid before the 26 H. 8.
(which Statute was repealed by Q. Mary) but at some times: but they were a
Popish invention at the first, and only of late years, though now continued
yearly, and further charges imposed in taxes to the poor, and subsidies to the
public in a greater proportion then by the Laity; provision of arms also,
though their tithes and dues are abated and cut short more then anciently, not
only by fraud and false payment, but also by unconscionable small rate-tithes
and customs almost most in every Parish: And also many great estates wholly
discharged of tithes, as Cistercian lands, and those of the Templars and
Hospitalers, (who had thirty thousand manours in Christendom, whereof a great
part were in England) by the Popes pretended privileges, and exemptions:
though we abhor and detest the Pope, yet for our profit we make use of his
Bulls and authority: all which losses and charges are not to be forgotten,
though we submit under them patiently, as our Savior Christ did to pay
tribute, when it was not due, Mat. 17.

And this we yield unto further, though we have lost almost all the ancient
privileges and immunities, which were formerly granted to the Clergy: which
were given, that they might be encouraged to attend their studies without
distraction or avocation by secular troubles: The ancient Kings and
Parliaments, allowing many freedoms from several services, impositions, and
taxes: as appears by many Laws and Charters, Tom. 1. Coucil. Britan.
in the first Tome of our English Councels, (see the title De libertatibus
Ecclesiae) and by Lord Coke in the second of his Institutes upon Magna Charta,
page 3, 4. where he reckons up many privileges, and how Ecclesiastical
persons ought to be quit and discharged of tols, and customs, as avirage,
pontage, paviage, and the like, from distresses by Sheriffs, and many others:
but as he there confesses, they are now lost, or not enjoyed: though anciently
they had more and greater liberties, then other of the Kings subjects; but now
no men are more burdened with taxes, and impositions, that we are become in the
sight of too many men, as the filth of the world, and the offscouring of all
things; as the Apostle complains, 1 Cor. 3. And whereas this Author shows,
ca. 3. how the habitation of the Minister should be as becomes students, and
men of contemplative life, under their own command and solitary. It now
happens, that no men's habitation is more troubled with vexations and soldiers
quartered upon them.

Besides the Priests and Levites had the ransomes of the firstborn both of man
and beast, great benefit by several kinds of sacrifices, and head money paid
yearly, and many other perquisites, Exodus 30.13.
and to what a sum (says Philo) these might amount, may be guessed by the
populousness of the Nation: and further they had 48. Cities set out by Joshua,
cap. 21. for their habitations, and two thousand cubits about them, Numb.
35.4, 5. No Tribe but the royal Tribe of Juda had so many Cities allowed to
them: as Jos. 15. and 21
(each cubit being a full yard) besides one thousand next the walls for their
cattle: whereunto were added 20. cities more in process of time, when the
number of the Tribe was increased greatly, as this Author shows, ca. 3. And
all this they had, though the Tribe of Levi was not near a tenth part of the
people, which yet is an error, that has possessed some great Names, (as M.
Seldom well observes) they thinking there was such a proportion of the Tithes,
and the receivers, and have rested therefore fairly satisfied in this, that the
Levites being one of the 12. Tribes, had the tenths as a competent maintenance
to themselves, being near the tenth, that is, being the twelfth part of the
people, as if arithmetically the people and the revenues had been divided: but
long since the sleightnesse and falsehood of this fancy has been discovered.
And clearly had such a proportion of persons, and the name of tenth held; yet
examine all that was paid to the Priests and Levites in first fruits, and the
several prediall tenths only, and it will be near a fifth part, to omit the
Cities and suburbs; but for proportion betwixt the tithes, we have sufficient
testimony in holy writ, that it was far otherwise, for they were only about a
threescore part of the people. Number. 1. and 3.
And so Bellarmine shows, Tom. 2. de clericis, cap. 25. -- Jam igitur addendo
Levitas caeteris Hebraeis, dividendo totum numerum per viginti duo millia,
efficiuntur parts divisae sexaginta. Ergo Levitae non erant pars tertia
decimae, sed vix sexagesima totius populi. A pitiful wonder it is to see
learned men allege such reasons: as Sir James Sempil says, p. 23.
It is to no purpose to look after any such thing, I rest in this (says M.
Seldom) that it pleased the Almighty so to enrich that Tribe, which was
reserved only for the holy service in the Temple: why he did so, or with what
proportion, let him for me examine, who dare put their profane fancies to play
with his holy text, and so most impudently and wickedly offer to square the one
by the other. Review, cap. 2.

Now because the Israelites were thus bountiful to their Priests and Levites,
therefore the Christians in succeeding times, gave not only many rich gifts
and grants in lands, and several oblations, but also for the continual
support and maintenance of the Clergy by tithes, Council. Valentin. Anno 855.
Com. 10. Tom. 3. Council.
they made Laws that every one should pay a ninth part, besides their tenths,
that so they might be sure to pay more then a tenth, with an overplus rather
then come short by any less quantity: and much to that purpose the learned
Grotius shows, De jure belli ac pacis, li. 1. ca. 1. 17. Lex vetus de
Sabbatho and altera de decimis, monstrant Christianos obligari, nec minus
septima temporis part ad cultum divinum, nec minus fructuum decima in alimenta
eorum qui in sacris rebus occupantur, aut similes pios usus seponunt. But this
is more fully proved by the learned Spelman in his Glossary, Nonae] quas pii ex
propensiori in Deum animo dabant, ultra decimas. Quod plurimis Ll. allatis
probat and explicat. Glossar. Dni. Spelm.
where he alleges and explicateth several Laws of diverse Kings, which are
too many to be here recited, but shall be produced in due time and place.

Now if any motives will effectually encourage men to pay their dues with a
liberal hand and eye, or deter the hearts of worldly men from keeping back,
profaning or taking away that which has been settled, given and granted by
Laws divine and humane, it must be the actions and examples of our Savior
Christ himself, who plainly discovered his zeal against sacrilege and
profaning of holy things and places, more then against any other sin. For when
he began to execute his Prophetical office, and reproved all kind of sins
among the people, yet he proceeded to punish not any save only sacrilege,
which is very remarkable. He refused to be Judge in dividing the inheritance
between the two brethren, and he would give no sentence against the woman taken
in adultery: but in case of sacrilege himself made the whip, himself punishes
the offenders, himself overthrows the money tables, and drives out the
prophaners out of the Temple, with their sheep and their oxen, not suffering
the innocent doves to remain, though all these were for sacrifice, and but in
the outward Courtyard of the Gentiles: such was his zeal as himself refused
not to be the accuser, the Judge, and the executioner; and this not only once
but twice, at the first in the beginning of his Ministry, recited by S. John,
c. 2.14. and at the last near the conclusion thereof, Mat. 21.11. Jesus quam ad
facra emendanda bis conspicuo signo testatum hoc fecit, templum velut sacrorum
sedem purgando circa initium, and circa clausulam sui muneris, ut in quo
inceperat in eo se desinere ostenderet. Grotius in Johan. 2.14. And S. Hierome
accounts it to be one of the greatest miracles that ever Christ did. In Mat.
21.
Many men do account that the greatest miracle that ever Christ did, Plerique
arbitrantur maximum esse signorum, quod Lazarus est suscitatus: quod caecus ex
utero lumen acceperit: quod ad Iordanem vox audita sit Patris: quod
transfiguratus in monte, gloriam ostenderit triumphantis: mihi inter omnia
signa, quae fecit, hoc videtur mirabilius esse, quod unus homo, and illo
tempore contemptibilis, and in tantum vilis, ut postea crucifigcretur, Scribis
and Pharisaeis, contra se saevientibus, and videatibus, luera se destruisse,
potuerit ad unius flagelli verbera, tantam ejicere multitudinem, mensasque
subvertere, and Cathedras confringere, and alia facere, quae infinitus non
fecisset exercitus, igneum ei quiddam atque sydereum radiabat ex oculis ejus,
and divinitatis Majestas lucebat in facie. Hieron.
was the raising of Lazarus out of the grave, or the restoring of sight to him
that was born blind; that the voice of his Father was heard at Jordan; or that
at his transfiguration in the Mount he showed forth his glory: but I rather
think, the greatest wonder that ever Christ did, was, that he being but one
single man, and all that time in a contemptible condition, and so vile, that
shortly after they crucified him, should be able with a whip to drive out of
the Temple such a multitude of men, officers, buyers and sellers, and overthrow
their tables, seats, and receipts, (the Scribes also beholding it, and seeing
their own profit to be overthrown thereby) and do such a strange thing, as a
whole Army of men could not have done it at another time. But his principal end
being to cleanse and purge his Temple and House of Prayer, from profanation,
sacriledgss, and abuses, it plainly shows us, how edious a sin it is, to be
guilty of the like abuses: and what punishment men must expect in his appointed
time to follow upon the like offense, though now he does forbear such
miraculous proceedings in these latter days; when we are directed to search the
Scriptures so plainly published to us, and to take admonition from former
examples, which are recorded for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world
are come.

Some are of opinion lately, that so the Clergy may have a competent
maintenance, whether it be by stipend, or any way else, it is sufficient
provision for them: and because diverse have published their opinion this way,
here shall be something in answer to them. These men make themselves wiser then
God himself, for he required tithes and first fruits in their kind, not in
money: Decimas and primitias tuas non tardabis offerre, Exodus 22.29. he could
have appointed some shakels of the Sanctuary to be paid to every Priest and
Levite, for the maintenance of himself and his family, if that had been the
best and most centain: means, But the uncertainty of stipends, collections, or
payments in money is so great, as would in process of time bring very great
losses and inconveniences, both upon the people in payments, and upon the
Clergy; for the change and variations of the standard for money is so great and
uncertain in all ages, (as this learned Author shows in his Glossary in voce,
Esterlingus and Libra --) that if an hundred pound according to these times,
should be allowed for a stipend to a Minister yearly, it may be as much in
value as 300 l. or 400 l. in the compass of an hundred years following: as we
find evidently by the experience of the last hundred years past; and so
likewise of every hundred years since the Conquest, and before it: which has
happened of late times by the discovery of the West Indies, the trade and
commerce thither, and the riches of their mines brought into Europe, all which
may fail in the next age, or be otherwise diverted, and stopped, beyond the
imagination or providence of any man. Further, by payment of tithes in kind out
of all profits arising by Gods blessing on our labors, the Clergy do partake
with the people in times of plenty, or suffer with them in extremities, whereas
by a certain stipend in money, they would be far less sensible. Also the change
and alteration of the fundamental Laws of this Kingdom touching tithes glebe,
oblations, and other means, which have continued in force above a thousand
years, and settled by the Common Law, will produce many mischiefs, especially to
the Crown, in payment of tenths and first fruits, subsidies, pensions, and
other taxes, which amount yearly unto many thousand pounds to the Exchequer:
all which must be abated and lost to the Crown; for no reason they should be
paid when the means and maintenance shall be taken away; out of which they
arise.

Besides the impossibility to provide a sure and settled means in every Parish
to pay a certain stipend in money quarterly to the Minister, there can be no
caution, provision, or security given or established for payment of money; for
we see by daily experience that all bonds, conveyances, and securities do
fail often, whatsoever the devise be for secure payment. No way is comparable
to Gods own way of giving yearly the tenth part in kind, of every increasing
commodity, and all lawful profits, as they arise and grow due at several
seasons of the year. As for stipends and pensions, because they have been
lately invented in some forain Churches, in times of war, great troubles and
distractions; I will mention only one mischief, which is already published in
print; and that is, that the best learned are oftentimes neglected, and put to
hard shifts, as in the Low Countries John Drusius lately a very painful and
learned man, well known for his singular works: He complains in an Epistle to
Joseph Scaliger before his Commentary on the Maccabees, that he was in want of
things necessary; and elsewhere prays unto God to stir up the hearts of the
great ones to help him: May heaven and earth take notice (says one thereof)
how miserable the condition of the learned is, when tithes the fixed honourary
of the Priesthood by divine right, are usurped by the Laics, and reward is
measured not by true worth, or by the measure of the Sanctuary, which was full,
running over and double to the common and profane measures; but by the
ignorant estimate of niggardly Mechanics and their underagents. Many more such
complaints might be easily alleged out of Luther, Melancthon, Calvin, and
others, which I will now forbear: one great reason being, that their Churches
for most part are still under great persecution, miserable wars, pitifully
wasted, being never almost quietly composed, nor settled by Kings and
Parliaments, as ours has been; for the Emperor and many great Kings and
Princes continue Papists, and great adversaries to Reformation: whereby
Germany, France, and Poland, have most sharply suffered, and lost many thousand
Churches and Ministers, since the the blazing Comet 1618. the people being
relapsed and enforced to Popery for want of Ministers: which makes the reverend
and learned Deodatus, Professor at Geneva, magnify the Church of England, as
the most eminent of all the reformed Churches in Christendom styling it,
Florentissima Anglia, Ocellus ille Ecclesiarum, peculium Christi singular,
perfugium afflictorum, imbellium Armamentarium, inopum promptuarium, spei
melioris vexillum, -- splendidae Domini caulae, -- and much more he adds,
speaking of our condition before these troubles.

If any demand what success the labors of this worthy Knight found among the
Gentlemen of Norfolk, and other places, where he lived long in very great
esteem, and publicly employed always by his Prince and Country in all the
principal offices of dignity and credit, it is very observable to allege some
particular testimonies worthy to be recorded to posterity, and with all honor
to their names, who were persuaded presently upon the reading of his first
little Treatise (and perhaps upon sight of the larger work now published, more
the like good effects may follow) to restore and render back unto God what was
due to him.

And first the worthy Knight practiced according to his own rule: for having an
Impropriation in his estate, viz. Middleton in Norfolk, he took a course to
dispose of it for the augmentation of the Vicarage, and also some addition to
Congham a small Living near to (...) Himself never put up any part of the rent,
but disposed of it by the assistance of a reverend Divine his neighbor M.
Thorowgood, to whom he gave power to augment the Vicars portion, which has
been performed carefully: and having a surplusage in his hands he waits an
opportunity to purchase the Appropriation of Congham, to be added to the
Minister there, where himself is Lord and Patron.

Next Sr Ralph Hare Knight, his ancient and worthy friend in that Country, upon
reading of the first Book, offered to restore a good Parsonage, which only he
had in his estate, performing it presently, and procuring license from the
King, and also gave the perpetual Advowson to Saint John's College in
Cambridge, that his heirs might not aforewards revoke his grant: wherein he was
a treble benefactor to the Church, and the College has deservedly honored
his memory with a Monument of thankfulness, in their Library, and also wrote a
respective letter of acknowledgement to this excellent Knight, to whom they
knew some part of the thanks to be due, for his pions advice and direction.

Sir Roger Townsend a religious and very learned Knight, of great estate in
that County, restored three Impropriations to the Church, besides many singular
expressions of great respect to the Clergy, having had a great part of his
education together with Sr John Spelman, (a Gentleman of incomparable worth)
eldest son to Sr Henry, and by his directions both attained great perfection
and abilities.

The like I have understood of others in that Country, but cannot certainly
relate their names and all particulars at this present, that Shire abounding
with eminent Gentlemen of singular deserts, piety, and learning, besider other
ornaments, as Cambden observes of them.

In other parts diverse have been moved with his reasons to make like
restitution, whereof I will mention some: as Sir William Dodington Knight of
Hampshire, a very religious Gentleman, restored no less then six
Impropriations, out of his own estate, to the full value of six hundred pounds
yearly and more.

Richard Knightley of Northamptonshire lately deceased, restored two
Impropriations, Fansley and Preston, being a Gentleman much addicted to works
of piety, charity, and advancement of learning, and showing great respect to
the Clergy.

The right honorable Baptist Lord Hicks Viscount Campden, besides many
charitable works of great expense to Hospitals and Churches, as I find printed
in a Catalogue of them in the Survay of London, restored and purchased ^^^ny
Impropriations.

1. He restored one in Pembrokeshire which cost 460 l. 2. One in
Northumberland, which cost 760 l. 3. One in Durham, which cost 366 l. 4.
Another in Dorsetshire, which cost 760 l. He redeemed certain Chantry lands,
which cost 240 l. And gave pensions to two Ministers, which cost 80 l. Besides
Legacies to several Ministers. --

The particulars are more fully recited in the Survay, to which I refer, page
761.

Ms Ellen Goulston Relict of Theodore Goulston Dr of Physic, a very learned
man, being possessed of the Impropriate Parsonage of Bardwell in Suffolk, did
first procure from the King leave to annexe the same to the Vicarage, and to
make it presentative, and having formerly the donation of the Vicarage, she
gave them both thus annexed freely to St John's College in Oxon: expressing
many godly reasons in a pious letter of her grant, to advance the glory of God
to her power, and give the world some testimony, that she had not been a
fruitless observer of those who taught her that knowledge, without its fruit,
and that love of Christ, without love to his Church was but an empty mask of an
empty faith.

Thus with devout prayers for a blessing from God upon those which should be
chosen Rectors there, she commended the deeds and conveyances of the Parsonage
for ever to the College. And this way does justly seem the best manner of
restitution, it being a double benefit to the Church both in providing
carefully for the Parish, and selecting out of the Universities able and worthy
Divines in due time and manner without any corruption, which the Colleges are
careful to avoid; and therefore that course was followed by Sir Ralph Hare
already mentioned, by the prudent advise of Sir Henry Spelman: which course if
it had been observed by them who lately were employed in purchasing of
Impropriations, they had freed themselves from sinister suspicions, by
devesting themselves wholly of any prosits reserved to their disposing, and
might have much advanced the glory of God by diligent preaching, within the
campasse of few years: and many would have been persuaded easily to become
contributers and benefactors to their purpose.

Diverse Colleges in Oxon: having been anciently possessed of Impropriations,
have of late years taken a course to reserve a good portion of the tithe corn,
from their tenants, thereby to increase the Vicars maintenance: so that the
best learned Divines are willing to accept the Livings, and yet the College is
not diminished in rents, but loses only some part of their fine, when the
tenants come to run their Leases.

Certain Bishops also have done the like; as Dr Morton, whiles he was Bishop of
Lichfield did abate a good part of his fine to increase the portion of the
Minister in the Vicarage of Pitchley in Northamptonshire, belonging to his
Bishopric: and so did his successor Dr Wright, for the Vicarage of Torcester
also in the same shire: which was very piously done, considering what great
Lands and Manours were taken away from that Bishopric among others, and some
Impropriations given in lieu of them.

Besides, this present Parliament has taken singular care to augment the
maintenance of many poor Vicarages, and other small Livings: wherein they have
proceeded carefully, and have made many additions to several poor benefices,
for the better inabling of the incumbent Ministers to be faithful and diligent
in their callings.

And while Six Hen. Sp. lived, there came some unto him almost every Term at
London to consult with him, how they might legally restore and dispose of their
Impropriations to the benefit of the Church: to whom he gave advice, as he was
best able, according to their particular cases and inquiries, and there wanted
not others, that thanked him for his book, promising that they would never
purchase any such appropriate Parsonages to augment their estates. Whereby it
appears how effectually the consciences of many men were moved with his
moderate and pious persuasions: and himself was much confirmed in his opinion
of the right of Tithes, which moved him to consign his works of this argument,
besides others, to my care, with direction to publish them, as is also
expressed in his last Will and Testament.

Whereupon I hold my self obliged in conscience and duty to God, and to the
memory of this excellent Knight, to whom I was infinitely obliged for his
instructions, conferences, and favors, which I enjoyed in the course of my
studies, many years frequenting his house and company: not to conceal these
works any longer from the public view, but to publish them to the benefit of
the Church, and servants of God, now especially when profaneness has so
licentiously overflowed, and the covetous wretches and Mammonists of this
world, have begun to withdraw and deny their Tithes, muttering that they are
Popish and superstitious, and therefore to be rooted out, as their language is:
wherein yet the Parliament has honorably discovered their zeal and care by
their censure and check upon the Petition against Tithes exhibited in May 1646.
and by their Ordinance providing for the true payment of all tithes, rights,
and dues to the Church, as more fully appears therein.

Wherein they have followed the modern and ancient Laws, as that expression
of the Act of Parliament, 27 Hen. 8. cap. 20. That whereas numbers of ill
disposed persons, having no respect of their duty to Almighty God, but against
right and good conscience did withhold their Tithes due to God, and holy
Church: as in that Statute is more at large expressed. So in the 12. Tables,
Sacrum sacrove commendatum qui dempserit rapseritve, parricida esto. It being
accounted sacrilege by all Laws to take away such things as have been formerly
given to God: for so they were given expressly to God: as Magna Charta says:
Concessimus Deo -- we have given to God, for us and our heirs, etc. So Charles
the great: We know that the goods of the Church are the sacred indowments of
God. To the Lord our God we offer and dedicate whatsoever we deliver to his
Church. Cap. Car. lib. 6. So Tully anciently: Communi jure gentium sancitum est
ut ne mortales, quod Deorum immortalium cultui consecratum est usucapere
possint. So Calvin, Sacrum Deo non fine insigni in eum injurin ad prosanos usus
applicatur. Instit. li. 3. cap. 7. 1.

Tithes therefore being consecrated unto God, ought carefully to be preserved
in these days, in regard the Church enjoys not the tithe of the tenth, which
formerly it had, and has also to this day among the Papists, who do not take
away from the Church, but are ready to restore, as they have done in many
Countries.

In the catalogue of Benefactors and Restorers of Impropriations, there is
omitted among others.

The Right honorable Lo: Scudamore, Viscount. Siego, who has very piously
restored much to some Vicarages in Herefordshire: whereof yet I cannot relate
particulars fully.

Dr Fell the worthy Dean of Christ-Church in Oxon: (with the consent of the
Prebendaries) has for his short time, since he was Dean, been very careful
and pious in this kind, besides great reparations of the decayed and imperfect
buildings, and other necessaries of the college: in renning and granting
Leases to the Tenants of Impropriations, he has reserved a good increase of
maintenance to the incumbent Ministers in diverse places, and has put things
into a course for the like increase in other Vicarages, as Leases shall happen
to be renewed. And much more might have been done, if King Hen. 8. had not
taken away the goodly Lands provided for that college by Wolsey, giving
Impropriations for them, by which exchange he was a great gainer.

New College, Magdalen Coll: and Queens Coll: have done the like upon their
Impropriations, and some others have made augmentations also, whereof the
particulars shall appear hereafter, upon perfect information.

The Introduction.
GOD has created all things for his glory; Prove. 16.4. for himself. Esaias.
43.7.
and must be glorified by them, all in general, and by every of them in
particular. The celebration of this his glory, he has committed in heaven to
the Angels, in Earth unto Man. Yea the devils declare his glory, and Hell it
self roareth it forth. For this purpose he has assigned unto man the circuit
of the whole earth, to be the stage of this Action, and the place of his
habitation, whilst it is in hand. Wisd. 9.2. Ecclus. 17.2.
He has delivered unto him the wealth and furniture thereof, to be the
materials for performing of it: and the means of his maintenance in the mean
season. And lest he should want leisure, and opportunity sufficient for so
great a business, he has commanded the heavens themselves, the Sun, the
Moon, the Stars, yea the whole frame of Nature, Deuteronomy. 4.19.
to attend upon him, to apply their sweet influence unto him: to assist him in
all his endeavors, and to measure him out a large portion of time and life for
the full accomplishing of this right noble most glorious Vocation. Ecclus. 17.2.


It is a rule in Philosophy that Beneficium requirit officium. And we are
taught by the law of nature, that he which receives a benefit owes to his
benefactor, Honor, Faith, and Service, according to the proportion of the
benefit received. Upon this rule was the ancient law not owes of England, but
of other Nations also, grounded, that compelled every man that had Lands, or
tenements of the gift of another to hold them of his Donor, and to do him
fealty and service for them, (that is, to be faithful unto him, and to yield
him some kind of vassallage) though no such matter were once mentioned between
them; Yea at this day, if the King give Lands to any man without expressing a
tenure, the Donee shall not only hold them of him, but he shall hold them by
the greatest and heaviest service, viz. Knights service in Capite. But God
knowing the heart of man, and seeing that man was like those husbandmen in the
Gospel, which having the possession of the Vineyard, forgot their Lord of whom
they received it; he thought not sit in wisdom to leave the rights and
services due unto him in respect of this his seignory and donation unto the
mutable construction of Law and Reason: but has expressly declared in his
written word in what sort man shall enjoy and hold these his infinite benefits.
Therefore since our own reason has taught us, that we owe no less unto our
earthly benefactors then Homage, Fealty, and some honorary and subsidiary rent
for the Lands and tenements we receive of them; much more effectually must the
same reason teach us, that we owe a far larger proportion of all these unto
God, of whom besides our essence and creation we have received such innumerable
blessings.

But as God is a Prince full of all royal munificence and bounty, so is he
likewise of all abundance and riches: therefore he neither needs nor
requires anything of all that we possess, as a subsidiary rent wherewith to
enrich his coffers, or support his estate, but as an honourary tribute toward
the magnifying of his goodness, and the expressing of our own thankfulness.
This, to be short, is the sum of all religion. Therefore whilst David with
admirable strains of divine meditations flies through the contemplation of all
the glorious works of God, and of our duty to him in respect thereof, he
breaks out in every passage of his Psalms with variety of acclamations and
invitations to stir us up to glorify God, not only inwardly by the spirit,
but outwardly also, in, and by, and with all worldly things and means
whatsoever. And not knowing how or whereto contain himself in this his
passion of most blessed zeal, he runs at last, as he were wild with it, and
closes up his Psalter, with Psalm upon Psalm, six or seven together, one
upon the neck of another, only to quicken and enforce our sluggish disposition
to a work of so great consequence and necessity.

It almost carries me from my purpose; but to return to my self, let us see
in what way we must glorify God with these external things that we have thus
received from him, and that is, as before we have showed, in the same steps
that the rules and maxims of his own law have prescribed. viz.

First, that we shall do unto him Homage, that is, Him only shall thou serve.
Secondly, that we shall be faithful unto him, Thirdly, that we shall pay duly
unto him, all rights, Give unto God that that is Gods. And again; Give the
Lord the honor due unto his name, etc. Psalm. 29.1.
For all which we must be accomptants at the great Audit: and there lies a
special writ of Praecipe in that case; Read rationem villicationis tuae, Give
an account how thou have carried thy self in this thy business, that is, this
his service committed to thee.

But omitting to handle the first and second of these great Reservations, I
have undertaken the last, viz. de reddendis Dei Deo, of ren dring that unto God
that is Gods. And in this I humbly beseech his blessed hand to be with me, and
guide me, for whose only sake and honor I have adventured to leave the shore
I crept by in my former book, and now as with full sails to launch forth into
the deep, upon so dangerous and uncertain adventure. Amen.

Of TITHES.
CAP. I.
What things be due unto God.

THat that is to be rendered unto God for his honor, out of temporal things
granted by him unto man, are by his word declared to be some particular
portions of the same things.

The things granted unto man be of three sorts, viz.


Touching the first, which is the Time of our life: six days shall thou
labor, and do all that thou have to do, but the seventh day is the sabbath
of the Lord thy God. What other time soever we employ privately and
particularly in his worship, this must generally be performed, and kept both by
our selves and our very cattle, for if every creature groan with us, Romans
8.22. it is also just, that they rejoice with us sometime. But though God be
much wronged in this kind, as well as in other his rights, yet since it is
confessed of all parts to be due unto him, by the express Canon of his word, I
will not meddle with it any farther: only I desire that the abusing of it were
severely punished, or at least in such sort as the Laws have appointed.

CAP. II.
The second kind of tribute that we are to render unto God, i. a portion of our
Land.

THe second thing that God has given unto man is a place for his residence,
and that is the earth in general, and to every nation and family a part
thereof in particular. The earth has he given to the children of men: Psalm.
115.16. But as he reserved a portion of the time of our life for the
celebration of his honor, so has he also reserved a portion out of the place
of our residence. For in Ezekiel. 45. he commands the children of Israel, and in
them all the nations of the world, that when they come to inhabit the land he
gives them, they must divide it into three parts, one for the people, another
for the King, but the first for God himself. God must have Enetiam partem, as
the Lawyers term it, the part of the eldest, or first borne; for the tribe of
the Levi (that is, his Priests and Ministers) are called to be the first borne
of his people.

Therefore he says, When ye shall divide the Land for inheritance, ye shall
offer an oblation to the Lord, an holy portion of the Land. Ezekiel. 45. And by
and by he declares how it shall be employed, one part to the building of the
house of God, and the other part for the Priests and Ministers to dwell on. And
this is no Leviticall precept, but an institution of the Law of nature; and in
performance of the duty that he was tied unto by this Law, Jacob when he was
poor, and had not wherewithal to build God an house, yet he sanctified a
portion of ground, (when God had blessed him) to that purpose, by erecting a
stone and pouring oil on the head thereof, calling the place Bethel, that is,
the house of God, and vowing to build it, when God should bless and make him
able to do it: Genesis 28.22. which as Josephus testifies, Antiq. lib. 1. cap.
27. he afterward performed. And as God commanded the whole Nation of the
Israelites in general, that in laying out the chief City, they should first
assign a place unto God for his Temple and Priests: So likewise he commanded
every Tribe thereof in particular, that after they had their portion in the
division of the Land, they should likewise out of the same assign unto the
Levites Cities to dwell in, with a circuit, or suburbs of a thousand cubits
round about to keep their cattle in. Command the children of Israel that they
give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possessions Cities to dwell
in: ye shall also give unto the Levites the suburbs of the Cities round about:
so they shall have the Cities to dwell in, and the suburbs shall be for their
cattle, and for their substance, and for their beasts: And the suburbs of the
City, which ye shall give unto the Levites from the wall outward shall be a
thousand cubits round about. Numb. 35.2, 3, 4.

In execution of this Commandment every Tribe of Israel allotted certain
Cities to the Levites, out of their portion, according to the quantity thereof:
as appears, Jos. 21.41. The whole Land of promise according as St. Hierom
lays it out in his Epistle to Dardanus, Tom. 3.68. contains in length from
Dan to Bersabe scarce 160. miles, and in breadth from Joppa to Bethlem 46.
miles. A small portion of ground for a Kingdom so famous; and so small indeed,
as St. Hierom there says, that he is ashamed to tell the breadth of it, lest
it should give occasion to the heathen to blaspheme, or deride it: yet out of
this small territory (not so much as the principality of Wales with the
Marches) forty eight walled Cities (more then are in all England, as I take
it) were assigned only for their Clergy to dwell upon: their maintenance, and
revenues being otherwise provided generally through the whole Kingdom by
Tithes, oblations, and other devotions of their brethren. So that it is
apparent both by the Law of God, and Nature, that God must have one portion of
our Lands to build him an house on, that is, his Churches, and another portion
thereof for the habitation of his Levites, that is, his Ministers.

CAP. III.
That the portion of Land assigned to God must be sufficient for the habitation
of the Minister.

THough the portion of Land, thus to be rendered to God for his Ministers, be
not certain, yet is it thus far determined, that it must be answerable to
the necessity of the service, and to the number of the Levites; that is, there
must be Churches sufficient for the congregations; and habitations sufficient
for the Ministers and their families to dwell upon, with pasture convenient for
their domestical cattle. They must not be pulled from God with secular care,
and therefore their maintenance is appointed to arise by other means then by
tilling the Earth; but their habitation as befitteth students, and men of
contemplative life must be under their own command, and solitary. But what,
should the portion of the fruits of the earth assigned them for their
maintenance be certain, as namely the tenth part; and not the portion of Land
also allotted for their habitation? I answer, that as the people increase, so
also the fruit of the earth increases with them, by their industry and
labor; and therefore as the Levites increase in number, so do the rest of the
Tribes; and by reason thereof there is a greater increase of Tithe toward the
maintenance of the Levite: for the labor of ten men yields more profit then
the labor of five. But when the Levites were enclosed within walls, and
confined with immutable bounds, this circuit in reason could not always be
sufficient for them; And therefore being so increased as their Cities might not
contain them, they must of necessity have new places of habitation provided
for them. For in such cases God gave a general rule to the people, Deuteronomy.
12.19. Beware that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou linest in the
Land. And the people of the Jews in this necessity did not forsake the
Levites, for before the transmigration to Babylon, (which was about 840. years
after) the Leviticall Cities (as appears, 1 Chronicles. cap. 6. and cap. 9.1. were
grown to be about sixty eight, viz. twenty more then were appointed by Josua.
They might not enlarge the bounds prescribed to their Cities, but they might
increase the number of the Cities, as the number of the Levites increased, and
necessity required. The reason is, they might not add house to house, and
field to field, lest growing great in earthly possessions they should forget
God, who had otherwise provided for them, then by manuring the earth, but if
they wanted habitations, they might then seek for new Cities, and the care of
the people was to provide them for them. One Levite might not have more then
sufficient for his habitation, but if the Cities appointed were not sufficient
to yield an habitation for every Levite, then might they assign new Cities to
that purpose.

CAP. IV.
That Christ released not the portion due to God out of our Lands.

THe possession of Lands is ex jure ^^umino, but the earth is the Lords ex jure
divine. Therefore when he granted the earth to the children of men, and
reserved a portion thereof for his service and Ministers, this part thus
reserved is in him and his Ministers ex jure divine. In this right Christ
calls the Temple the house of God, and says also, My house shall be on house
of prayer. And St. Paul says; 1 Crr. 11.22.
Despise ye the house of God? So that, doubtless, God must have houses for his
forvice in all places where we inhabit. But Christ had not wherein to lay his
head, Mat. 8.20. Luke 9.18. therefore the Ministers must have no houses
provided for them: for the disoiple is not above his master. Christ indeed had
not whereon to lay his head: for he came to his own, and his own received him
not. But does this prove that Ministers should neither have nests in the air
like birds, nor holes in the ground like foxes? Did not he that made the
Vineyard in the Gospel, build a tower in it for them that dressed it? So like
wise must the Ministers that attend upon the Vineyard of the Church, have their
habitations in it. St. Paul appointed it so, when he commands us to render a
portion unto them, (...), of all the good things, Gal. 5.6. How have they a
part in all, if they want it, in the chiefest of all, that is, in our
habitations? Again he commands that they should be Hospitales,
Goodhouskeepers; how should they be so, if they have no houses to keep? John
Baptist lived in the wilderness; it is true, and he was commended for it.
Christ did not so, though he frequented the fields, yet in that he gave no
Commandment that his disciples should follow him; for he appointed them to
remain in other men's houses. What? that they should go sojourne where they
listed? The Commandment has nothing to the contrary; but the meaning is
thereby apparent, they must have habitations provided for them, or else, shake
off the dust of your feet against them, Mat. 10.14. as much as to say, let them
be accursed. So then our Savior has not repealed the Law of providing for the
Levites, unto his Ministers: He could not give them Cities to possess, for his
kingdom was not of this world. But he appointed them to such places, as
themselves should choose among the children of the Gospel. Does this differ
from the Commandment of providing Cities for the Levites? Doubtless, no: for as
the Logitians say, Convenient in eodem tertio. They agree in this, that the
Ministers must have habitations provided for them, as well in the Gospel, as
the Levites had under the Law. Oh, but they must have no inheritance among
their brethren, for the Lord is their portion. Numb. 18.24. It is true, the
Lord has communicated with them his own portion, viz. his tithes and his
offerings, as he did with the Levites; therefore as the Levites had no share in
the division of the Land, so our Ministers must have no share with us in
tilling the Land, and matters of husbandry, for they are called from secular
cares to spiritual contemplation; but after the Israelites had their shares in
the Land they yielded portions to the Levites for their convenient residence,
and so must we for our Ministers. And so still the conclusion is, they must be
provided for. Which, to shut up the matter, is invincibly ratified by our
Savior himself, who in sending forth his disciples would not suffer them to
take the least implements of sustenance with them, because he would put them
absolutely upon the care and charge of the congregation, alleging a Maxim of
the moral Law for warranty thereof, that the labourer is worthy of his hire.
Mat. 10.10. And therefore into whose house soever you enter, stay there. Mat.
10.11.

CAP. V.
What part in reason, and by direction of Nature might seem fittest for God.

It being agreed that some part by the Law of Nature is due unto God out of all
the time of our life, and the goods that we possess, it is now to be examined
how far this Law of nature or reason may lead us to the discovery of that part
or portion. For which purpose we must for a while lay aside Canonical
Divinity, I mean the Scriptures, and suppose our selves to live in the ages
before the Law was given, that is, in the time of nature. And then let us
propose this question to the Sages of that world, and see what answer we are
like to receive from them. And first touching this question, What portion of
our time or goods were fittest for God.

It is like they would have considered the matter in this manner. That God has
not any need either of our time, or goods, and that therefore he requires them
not in tanto, that is, to have so much, and no less. But on our parts it is
our duty to yield unto him as much in quanto as we can conveniently forbear
over and besides our necessary maintenance. So that as Bracton says of Hyde,
that tenants are to yield unto their Lords, it must be honorarium Domine, and
not grave tenenti, so much as the Lord may be honored by it, and the tenant
not oppressed; wherein if a second, third, or fourth part be too much, so a
twentieth or thirtieth seem also too little. As God therefore desires but an
honourary part, not a pressory: so reason should direct us to give him that
part, wherein his own nature with the respects aforesaid is most properly
expressed; for the maxim, or axiom which our Savior alleged, Date Deo quae
Dei sunt, give unto God the things that are Gods, is grounded on the Moral law
originally; and therefore examining among numbers which of them are most
proper, and resembling the nature of God, we shall find that seven and ten
above all other perform this mystery, and that therefore they are most
especially to be chosen thereunto; therefore God in the Creation of the world
following the light of nature, chused the seventh part of the age thereof, as
Philo Judaeus in his Book De fabricatione mundi, page 36. has with singular
and profound observations declared.

And because it may be demanded hereupon, why he should not by the same reason
have the seventh part of our goods also; I answer, that as touching the time of
our life, he gives that unto us of his own bounty, merely without any industry
on our part: so that whether we sleep, or wake, labor, or play, the allowance
thereof that he makes unto us, runs on of its own accord; and therefore we
owe him the greater retribution out thereof, as having it without labor or
charge. But as for the fruits of the earth we have them partly by our own
labor, though chiefly by his bounty; and therefore he therein requires his
part, as it were with deduction or allowance of our charges, seeking another
number befitting the same.

The first place in Scripture wherein a Priest is mentioned is Genesis 14.18.
where Melchisedek is said to be the Priest of the most high God; there also are
tithes spoken of, and paid unto him, v. 20. Abraham gave him tithes of all.

The first place also, where an House of God, or Church, is spoken of, is Genesis
28.18, and 22. there also are tithes mentioned and vowed unto God, even by that
very name whereby Parish Churches upon their first Institution in the Primitive
Church were also styled, that is, by the name of Tituli, Genesis 28.22. Lapis iste
quem pofui in titulum erit Domus Dei, and omne quod dederis mihi decimas
prorsus dabo tibi; wherein it seems the Primitive Church at that time
followed the translation then in use: for Damasus in the life of Euaristus
Bishop of Rome, Anno 112. says, Hic titulos in urbe Roma divisit Presbyteris,
Edit. 1606.
Tom. Council. 1. page 106. And speaking after of Dionysius, who lived Anno 260.
he says, -- Presbyteris Ecclesias divisit, and coemeteria, Parochiasque and
Diaeceses constituit. Tom. Council. 1. page 206. Thus Church and Tithe went
together in their first Institution.

If there be no mention after of Tithes in the Scripture till the time of
Moses, that is no reason to exclude them, for so also is there not of any House
of God, or Priest: yet no man will deny, but both are necessary, and therefore
let them also say, whether they be ex Jure divino; I mean Churches and Priests
before the Law and Gospel.

CAP. VI.
Concerning the Revenue and maintenance of the Church in her infancy, first in
Christ's time, then in the Apostles, by a communion of all things, and
submitting all to the Apostles; as in the Churches of Jerusalem, Alexandria,
Rome, and Africa. How the Clergy had their allowance given them, weekly, or
monthly, per sportulas, in baskets. De jure sportularum, concerning those
baskets and the manner of them. When Lands were first given. The Church goods
distributed by the Bishops and Officers under them. The liberality of
Constantine and other Emperors. The piety and charity of the Clergy in spending
their goods and means.

VVHilest the Church was in her foundation, she had no other maintenance, then
the poor private purse of our Savior, supported only by the alms and
contribution of his poor Disciples and followers; for as himself had no house
to live in, Joh. 12.6.
so had he no rents to live on: being therefore often in want, he was
constrained sometimes to use the power of his Godhead to supply the necessities
of his Manhood, and to call the fish of the sea to aid him with money
miraculously, Mat. 17.27. while the beasts of the Land withheld their devotion
from him unnaturally; but whatsoever it was that his Godhead blessed his
Manhood withal, he divided it, as appears in the Gospel of Saint John.
13.^9. into two parts; one for the sustenance of his family, the other for
relief of the poor. Touching the part assigned to his family, it was nor
curious, nor superfluous, no not at the great feast of Baster, when others were
so sumptuous, and profuse, his rule was then, to buy the things they had need
of. And touching the provision of his house at other times, we have twice an
Inventory taken of it, once in Matthew. 14.17. where it was found to be but five
loaves and two fishes: yea, Mar. 6.38. Luke 9.13. Joh. 6.9.
barley loaves: another time, Mat. 15.34. but seven loaves and a few little
fishes, for himself and his whole household; twelve Apostles in ordinary,
besides some servants, and a multitude of Disciples hanging upon him
extraordinarily. All the beasts of the forest were his, and so were the cattle
upon a thousand hills, yet read we not that he once killed so much as a Calfe,
for the provision of his family: for flesh could not be had but for money, and
money going always low with him, he used such kind of victuals especially, as
might always be supplied unto him by the industry of his Disciples from the
common storehouse of nature, the sea, without being beholding or burdensome to
any man.

In this frugality lived our Savior touching his household expense, that there
might be the greater remanet for the poor: and from this model of the Church
in his poor family, was the great frame of the Universal Church first devised,
as well for raising, as disposing of her Revenues; the means of raising them,
from the oblations and devotion of the people: the manner of employment of
them, for the necessity only of the Minister and poor. Thus much does
Augustine also declare upon the place alleged out of Saint John, Tractat. 62.
Habebat Dominus loculos, ^ist. 12.9.1. Habebat.
etc. Our Lord had his treasury or bag, wherein he kept the things that were
offered by the faithful, and did distribute them to his family and such other
as had need: then first was the form of Church government instituted.

The Apostles following our Savior exactly, would not be rich servants of a
poor master, nor owners of any thing, when their Lord himself possessed
nothing: holding it therefore not fit for them, aut in imis consistere, sed nec
in mediis, they reached at the highest garland of perfection: and because their
master had said, Let him that will be perfect, sell all that he has, and give
to the poor; whatsoever was their own, and whatsoever was given them by others,
they cast it all into the common treasury, disposing it by their masters
example to two uses only, Hospitality and Alms, or works of charity; in their
hospitality they provided for the whole family of the Church then living with
them at Jerusalem, (out of which arose the great business of serving the
Tables, spoken of in the Acts) all of them jointly caring for every man in
particular, and every man particularly applying himself to support the
general. Their alms and part assigned to them in necessity, they dispersed
fully and faithfully, not only to the poor of their own Town, City, or
Country, but wheresoever through the world the members of Christ had need.

And so careful they were in employing these things to the highest benefit and
honor of the church, that Paul chused rather to live in want, and earn his
sustenance with his fingers, then to diminish this blessed portion, by taking
his due share out of it. Yea, the only thing that the Apostles gave so
precisely in charge one unto the other, was in every passage, that they should
remember the poor, Gal. 2.10. Act. 11.36. 2 Cor. 9.3. as the bowels of Christ,
the darlings of the Church, and those whom God especially had chosen to be rich
in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, Jam. 2.5.

With this mortar (I mean this blessed theological work of charity, which S.
Paul so highly extolleth above other) did our Savior lay the first stones in
the foundation of his Church, and with it (to hold uniformity) did the Apostles
build the second course, commending the pattern to be for ever after pursued
throughout all ages: for whatsoever is built without it, is like stones laid
without mortar, which cannot therefore couple together, and grow into an holy
Temple in the Lord, as is required, Ephesians. 2.21.

In the succeeding Church founded by Saint Mark, (the Disciple of Saint Peter)
at Alexandria in Egypt, the same rule (used before by the Apostles at
Jerusalem) was so precisely established, ^ieron. in vita Marci.
that he thereby drew all Christians to follow his example; insomuch that Philo
Judaeus, a famous Author of that time, reports that not only there, but in
many other Provinces the Christians lived together in societies, and he calls
even then their habitations (...), Monasteries: saying, that none among them
possessed any thing to his private use; no man was rich, no man poor, but all
divided their substance to them in necessity; disposing themselves wholly to
Prayer, (...). i.e. ^mperantia, ^mtinentia, moestia.
singing of Psalms, to matter of doctrine, and to temperance.

Come lower down. Dionysius Corinthius in an Epistle to Soter Bishop of Rome,
in the year of Christ, 170. congratulateth with him, that the Church of Rome
still continued her ancient use in dispersing her goods in works of charity. It
is now grown to be an ancient custom with you, to bestow many benefits upon
all the brethren of the Church, and to send maintenance to the Churches in
every City: so that thereby you do not only relieve the necessity of the
poor, but of the brethren also which are condemned to the slavery of the metal
Mines, and by this benevolence of yours, which now you have used to send into
all places, even from the first Plantation of your Church, your selves being
Romans, have diligently preserved the Romans custom instituted by the Fathers;
which also your Bishop, the blessed Soter, has hitherto kept very diligently;
and by his laborious industry wonderfully advanced: not only in distributing
lovingly unto the Saints the goods ordained to their maintenance: but like a
merciful and mild father toward his children, in exhorting the brethren
(which come unto him) to virtue by blessed and devout persuasions. I report
this place at large, for that this use continued exactly in the Church, as
Eusebius reciting it affirms, till the great persecution under Maximinian,
and Dioclesian, which began about the year of our Lord, 304.) being the age
wherein Eusebius himself lived, as he there also testifies, lib. 4. cap. 22.

And that it was not thus in Rome only, but in Africa and other Churches, it
appears plainly by Tertullian in Apologet. cap. 39. where upbraiding the
Gentiles with the piety and devotion of Christians, he says, Etiam si quid
arcae genus est, etc. whatsoever we have in the treasury of our Churches is not
raised by taxation, as though we put men to ransom their Religion; but every
man that will, once a month, or when it pleases himself, bestows what he
thinks good, and not without he lists; for no man is compelled, but left
freely to his own discretion. That which is given, is accounted as Depositum
pietatis, the pledge of devotion; for it is not bestowed in banqueting,
quaffing, or gluttony, but in nourishing and burying the poor, and upon
children destitute both of parents and maintenance, aged and feeble persons,
men wracked by sea, and such as are damned to the metal mines, banished into
Islands, or cast into prison, professing the true God, and the Christian faith.

I might thus pass over the first 300. years of the Church, but I desire to
make it more apparent how the Clergy of those times lived as well for
conversation, as for maintenance. The times (to tell the truth) were such as
had not been from the very creation: Times wherein God opened the windows of
persecution, and rained blood upon his Church, as he did water upon the world
in the days of Noah; and as in the planting of the Law, he scourged the enemies
of his people with ten famous plagues, so now in the founding of the Gospel he
tried his children with ten grievous persecutions; by reason whereof the Clergy
then aspired so generally to the crown of martyrdom, that they prepared their
bodies to this sacrifice by the austerest rules of conversation that they could
devise, contemning all worldly pleasure, all curiosity of meat, drink,
apparel, sustenance and necessities, wasting their flesh with abstinence,
fasting, thin clothing, going sometimes barefoot, denying all things to every
sense, that it particularly delighted in, applying themselves wholly to Prayer
and Preaching, to support and enlarge the Gospel; and to be short, to do the
work of Gods Vineyard faithfully in all things and laboriously, as appears
abundantly in Eusebius, Nicephorus, Socrates, Ruffinus, and other ancient
Ecclesiastical Authors. These are they of whom the world was not worthy, these
gained every man his ten talents, and sit now in the first seats of heaven,
next unto the throne of the Lamb.

Touching their maintenance, the means thereof arise chiefly (as appears by
Tertullian, Origin, Cyprian, and others) out of the oblations of the people,
benevolences, first fruits, tithes, etc. which being continually offered at the
Altar, or brought into the treasury of the Church, were one while employed in
common to the diet and necessities of the brethren and Clergy, but at length
distributed by portions, first, weekly, as it seems by a decree of Pius the
first, Bishop of Rome, in the year of our Lord, 158. after monthly, as
appears by an Epistle of Cyprian ad clerum, lib. 4. Epist. 5. to every Priest
particularly. The manner how this was performed, appears not sufficiently in
the Authors of those times; but I will recite the places in their own
obscurities; first, touching that assigned to Pius, Tom. Con. 1. page 125. In
vita Pii.
Col. 6. Vt de oblationibus quae offeruntur a populo, and consecrationibus quae
supersunt, vel de panibus, quos deferunt sideles ad ecclesiam, vel certe de
suis: Presbyter convenienter parts incisas habeat in vase nitido, and
convenienti, ut post missarum solennia, qui communicare non fuerunt parati,
Eulogias omni die Dominico, and in diebus festis exinde accipiant, quae cum
benedictione prius faciat. Ex codice quinto librorum, lib. 2. c. 117.

And Cyprian in the place above cited, p. 126. Caeterum Presbyterii honorem
designasse nos illis jam sciatis, ut et sportulis iisdem cum Presbtyeris
honorentur, and divisiones mensurae aequalis quantitatibus partiantur: whereby
it appears that the Priests at this time (which was about the year 240.) had
every man his allowance delivered monthly per sportulas; that is, by baskets,
whereupon they were called fratres sportulantes, basket-brethren, or brethren
that lived on the basket; and it may be that some understanding the words, as
we now use them for an alms basket, could be contented that the Ministers lived
in like manner at this day. To deliver therefore that sacred and most
honorable profession from such base imputation, I hold it necessary to say
something of this jus sportularum.

Sportula, is sometimes used generally for every basket, sometimes particularly
for a Market basket, or panyer, and because the use among the Romans was to
cast their Market money into this basket, therefore that very money, and the
Market meat it self also was called sportula.

Besides it is taken for a vessel, a place, a portion, or provision of
victuals.

So Sportula Salutatoria, or Salutantium, was a basket, or mess of meat that
the great men of Rome by way of congratulation do give to the Cities which
came to visit them. Martial. lib. 1. Ep. ad Flaccum.

Dat Bajor a mihi quadrantes sportula centum,
Inter delicias quid facit ista fames?
And these great men had at the entry of their houses a place of purpose for
keeping this kind of provision, to bestow on their friends; which place was
thereupon also called sportula, which Iuvenal seems to aim at under the name
of limen prineum, Satyr. 1. -- Sportula primo

Limine parva sedet, turbae rapienda togatae. But expressly in his third Satyr.

Nonne vides quanto celebratur sportula fumo? Sportula publica, was a like
distribution made upon some notable occasion by the Senate and Emperors of
Rome, to the people in lieu of the solemn feastings formerly bestowed on them:
which allowances being afterward too niggardly abridged, Domitian (as
Suetonius in his life, cap. 7. reports) sportulas publicas sustulit, revocata
coenarum rectarum consuetudine, which Martial also remembers in an Epigram to
Domitian l. 8.

Grandia pollicitus quanto majora dedisti?
Promissa est nobis sportula, Recta data est.
Sportula nuptialis, signified the wedding feast or provision; Coelius
Rhodiginus Antiq. lect. l. 28. c. 21. apud Apuleium sportulas legimus
nuptiales, quippe (inquit) ita placuerat, insuburbana villa potius ut
conjungeremur, ne cives denuo ad sportulam convolarent.

Sportula convivalis is described also by Coelius, lib. 27. cap. 24. Eranon
(inquit est) quod pluribus differtum occumbentibus sit; sed ita ut ferat sibi
unusquisque quod edat, quod etiam (...), dicebatur, id est, sportula. Sportula
opipara, I may term that which is mentioned by Tully in his Epistles, Famil.
lib. 9. Ep. 20. Dediscendae tibi sunt sportellae and artologani, where some
interpret sportellae, for those meats, quae secundis mensis numerantur, dishes
of the second course, and greatest dainties.

So that sportula presbyteria was no base thing, but an honorable congiary, or
portion of victuals distributed to the Clergy, whether by the basket, as the
word signifies, or in vase nitido, as Pius appointed it; And thus much does
the very place alleged out of Cyprian entreat, where he says, sportulis idem
cum presbyteris honorentur.

What this sportula contained I cannot declare, but Alexand. ab Alexand.
Genial. dier. lib. 5. cap. 24. speaking of the Roman sportula publica says, In
qua frequens obsonium panis, oleum, and porcina caro dari solita est, absque
vino; and Domitius in his Comment. on the first Satyr. of Invenal, much more
fully, ex sportula omnia sibi coemebant, quae and ad victum and ad cultum
pertinerent. So that, sportula presbyteria, seems to be then a Cornu copia,
that ministered unto the Clergy all things they had need of, as well for
clothing, and other necessaries, as for sustenance. For no doubt the people of
God did at this time, not only according to the precept of the Apostle, make
the Ministers of the Word partakers of all their goods; but as Abraham did also
to Melchisedek present unto them, (...), the very top and chiefest part
thereof, following Abraham in offering the fat, and abhorring to give the
carrion things unto God, like the sacrifice of Cain.

And that it may be no disgrace to the honorable Ministers of the Church to
live thus, ex sportula, let me note by the way that the Kings and Princes of
the world are likewise said to live ex sportula; for their Exchequer or
Treasury has thereupon the name of Fiscus: which word as appears by
Ascanius, is all one with sportula. Strigelius in leg. lib. 2. page 307.
Fisci, fiscinae, fiscellae (says he) sportea sunt utensilia ad majoris summae
pecunias capiendas, unde quia major summa est pecuniae publicae quam privatae,
factum est ut fiscus pro pecunia publica and inde confiscare dicatur; a little
before he says, Sportae, sportulae, sportellae, munerum sunt receptacula; And
let me also remember that in the Eastern Empire, the Master of the Storehouse
and Wardrobe, as well Palatine, as Ecclesiastical, was called, (...), Codin. p.
5. Suidas.
and (...), that is, a Canistro, vel Sportula.

Touching Lands, though the Churches at this time had little, yet were they not
altogether without any, as appears partly by that which Eusebius reports of
Paulus Samosatenus, that under Aurelian the Emperor ( i. e. about the year
274.) he wrongfully invaded an house belonging to the Church of Antioch. But
more amply by the edict of Licinius, Apud Eusebius. l. 10. ca. 5.
and Constantine, where it is expressly commanded that all Lands and places
which belonged to the Christians, as well for their public use, as in their
private possession, that had been taken from them in the persecution of
Dioclesian, should be restored to them. Platina says, that Vrbane Bishop of
Rome, anno 227. first instituted, that the Church might receive Lands and
possessions offered by the faithful, and then shows to what end she might
enjoy them, namely, that the Revenues thereof should be distributed by portions
to every man, and that no man should have them to his particular benefit.
Vrbane himself in the Decretall Epistle attributed unto him, affirms this
usage to be more ancient, saying also, that the Bishops within their Diocese,
and other faithful persons (appointed by them) both did and ought to
distribute these Revenues in manner before mentioned; adding further that they
were called the oblations of the faithful, for that they were offered unto
God, and that they ought not to be otherwise employed then to Ecclesiastical
uses, the relief of Christian brethren, living together in common, and of the
poor people, for that they are the vows of the faithful, the price of sin, the
patrimony of the poor, and delivered over unto the Lord for the performance of
this work. Many account this Epistle Apocryphal, I will therefore strengthen
it with the opinion of Origin a Father of those times, who in his 16. Homily
upon Genesis, disputes it to be utterly unlawful for the Ministers of the
Gospel to possess any Lands, (to their own use, for so I understand him)
confessing himself not to be faultlesse herein; and therefore exhorting others
to join with him in Reformation thereof, he says, Festinemus transire a
sacerdotibus Pharaonis, let us make haste to depart from the Priests of
Pharaoh, who enjoy earthly possessions, to the Priests of the Lord, who have no
portion in earth, for that the Lord is their portion, fol. 26. col. 3. And to
show to what end the Church enjoys her goods, and in what manner they ought
to be divided amongst her Ministers and poor children, in his 31. Homily upon
Matthew he says -- Opus habemus ut fideles simus pariter and prudentes ad
dispensandos ecclesiae reditus, etc. It behooves us to be faithful in
disposing the rents of the Church. Faithful, that we our selves devour not
those things which belong unto the widows, and that we be mindful of the poor;
and because it is written, The Lord has appointed that they which preach the
Gospel, 1 Cor. 9.14.
should live of the Gospel; that we therefore take not occasion to seek more
for our selves then our simple diet, and necessary apparel: retaining a
greater portion to our selves then that we give to the brethren that are hungry
and thirsty, and naked, and which suffer necessity in secular affairs.
Discreet: as to minister to every man his portion, according to his rank and
dignity; remembering that which is said, Blessed is he which considers the
poor and needy, Psalm. 41. for it is not sufficient for us, simply to give away
the goods of the Church; so to keep our selves clear from devouring or stealing
of them, but we must wisely consider every man's necessity; how he falls into
it, what his dignity is, how he came by it, how much he needs, and for what
cause he needs it. We must not therefore deal alike with them which were
pincht, and hardly brought up in their infancy, and with them who being
nourished delicately and plentifully are now fallen into necessity. Neither
must we minister the same things to men and to women, nor like quantity to old
men, and young men; nor to sickly young men that are not able to earn their
living, and those which have somewhat of their own to maintain themselves withal.
It must also be considered whether they have many children; and whether those
children be idle, or industrious; and how far forth they are insufficient to
provide for themselves: to be short, there is great wisdom required in him
that would well dispose the Revenues of the Church, and that by being a
faithful and discreet disposer he may become an happy man. Thus far Origin;
to which purpose Cyprian also in his Epistle to Eucratius, lib. 1. Epist. 10.
shows that the Church maintained many poor, and that her own diet was
frugalioribus and innocentibus cibis, sparing and plain, and all her expense,
sumptibus parcioribus quidem sed salutaribus, full of frugality, but sufficient
for health.

The persons by whom this distribution of Church goods was made, were chiefly
the Bishops (as appears by the former Epistle of Vrbane) and Deacons
appointed under them as in the times of the Apostles, Acts 6. Therefore Origin
in his 16. Homily upon Matthew, fol. 31. col. 4. taxing the unfaithful Deacons
says, Diaconi autem, etc. But the Deacons which govern not well the tables of
the Ecclesiastical money, (that is, the goods and Revenues of the Church) but
do always purloin them, not distributing that which they give according unto
judgment; and so become rich by that which belongs unto the poor; they are
the Exchangers whose Tables Christ will overthrow. For the Apostles in their
Acts teach us, that the Deacons are Governors of the Tables of Ecclesiastical
moneys, (or Revenues) etc. and again after, -- unusquisque diaconorum. Every
one of the Deacons which gather wealth to themselves by defrauding the poor,
let them now so understand this Scripture, that they gather no more, lest the
Lord comes upon them, and overthrow the Tables of their distribution.

Thus much touching the use of Church goods in the first age of the Church, or
first 300. years of Christ: whereby it plainly appears, that no
Ecclesiastical person enjoyed any thing belonging to the Church to his own
benefit; but that the Churchmen had out of the Revenues and goods of the
Church, so much only as sufficed for their necessary maintenance in meat,
drink, cloth, and such like: the surplusage being faithfully employed to the
relief of the poor, the needy, the widows, persons banished for Religion, or
imprisoned, Captives, and Christians any way distressed. So that the Church
exposing all this while the dugs of her piety unto others, did live her self on
thistles, and thorns, that is, in want, necessity, and professed poverty.

When the flood of persecution had prevailed as many years against the Church
in the time of the Gospel, as that of waters did days against the wicked in the
time of Noah; and that Constantine like the Dove of the Ark had brought the
olive branch of peace unto the people of God: the Church then began to smell
the sweet savor of rest, and changing presently her disposition with her
fortune, changed also the very policy of her government: before in poverty, now
in riches; before a servant, now a Mistress; before a Captive, now a
Conqueror. For the noble Constantine being miraculously converted to the
faith, did not only free her from persecution, but settled her also in the very
bosom of peace, raised her to honors, endowed her with possessions,
established her with immunities; and to be short, poured upon her the fullness
of his regal munificence. Insomuch, that many prudent Fathers foreseeing then
another evil likely to proceed from hence; as namely, that her plenty might
make her wanton, and forgetful of her duty, began now to dispute whether it
were lawful for her to accept lands and Temporalties, or not: Some alleged
that the examples of our Savior and his Apostles bound them to contemn the
world, and to live in a strict and Stoic kind of poverty. Others conceived
that course to be but temporal, and like a medicinal diet prescribed by
Physicians to their patients in sickness only, not in health? affirming the
time to be now come, when it pleased God to crown the longsuffering of his
Church, with the blessings promised in the tenth of Mark, v. 29.31. That since
they had forsaken house, and brethren, and sisters, and father, and mother, and
wife, and children, and lands for Christ's sake and the Gospel; they should
receive un hundred fold now at this present, with their persecutions, and in
the world to come eternal life. I will not argue this point, but letting pass
the Schoolmen, will rest my self upon the determination of many ancient
Councels, Fathers, and Doctors of the Church, who with one consent conclude
affirmatively, that the Church may hold them.

And I think their opinion to be of God, for that it has prevailed these 1500.
years against all the enemies thereof, though the Kytes of Satan have pulled
many a plume from it.

To return to Constantine; though he and others by his example did abundantly
enrich the Church, yet did not the Churchmen take these riches to the benefit
of themselves, and their families, but employed them as before to works of
charity, Yea, Silvester himself, though the sea of these things flowed into
his bosom, and were at his pleasure, yet took he as sparingly of them, as if
he had been but a little pitcher, suffering the whole streams thereof to run
abundantly amongst the children of the church, and poor people, as did also the
other Fathers, Priests, and Clergy of that time, who reckoned not otherwise of
riches then as dung, which being spread and scattered in the fields of God,
might make them the more fertile. For the resolution then was (as in the age
before) that no Churchman might take Lands to his private use, nor the Church
her self otherwise then for works of charity, and the necessary sustenance of
her Ministers, not to make stocks or portions for them in earth, whose
inheritance was in heaven, and that had God himself for their portion.
Therefore Prosper a godly Father of that time, Lib. 21. de vita Contemplativa.
whose authority is often used in the Council of Aquisgrane, disputing the
point, concludes it thus; If every Minister of the Church have not a Living,
the Church does not provide one for him in this world, but helps him with
things necessary, that he may receive the reward of his labor in the world to
come, resting in this life upon the promise of our Savior. To which purpose he
applies the place in the 1 Cor. 9.14. What is it to live of the Gospel, but
that the labourer should receive his necessaries from the place wherein he
labors? And a little before him, Hierome also in his Book De vita Monach.
Cler. instituenda -- says, Epist. ad Nepotianum.
If I be the Lords part and the lot of his inheritance, not having a part
amongst the rest of the Tribes; but as a Levite and Priest do live of tithes,
and serving at the Altar, am sustained by the offerings of the Altar: having
victuals and clothing, I will be contented herewith, and being otherwise
naked, will follow the naked cross. So in his Book De Co. virginitatis, having
reproved the curiosity of some Clerks of that time, he says also, Habentes
victum and vestitum his contenti sumus: for as Ambrose says upon Esaias 1. Tom.
2. In officio clericatus lucrum non pecuniarum, sed acquiritur animarum. In the
function of a Clegy-man the gain of money is not to be sought, but the gain of
souls.

All these are but particular opinions of some Western Fathers: hear now
therefore the determination of the Eastern church assembled in the Council of
Antioch, Anno 340. cap. 25. Episcopus Ecclesiasticarum rerum habeat potestatem,
ad dispensandum erga omnes qui indigent, cum summa reverentia, and timore Dei;
participet autem and ipse, quibus indiget, tam in suis, quam in fratrum qui ab
eo suscipiuntur, necessariis usibus, profuturis, ita ut in nullo qualibet
occasion fraudentur, juxta sanctum Apostolum sic dicentem, Habentes victum and
tegumentum his contenti sumus. Quod si contentus istis minime fuerit, convertat
autem res ecclesiae in suos usus domesticos, and ejus commoda vel agrorum
fructus, non cum Presbyterorum conscientia, diaconorumque pertractet, sed horum
potestatem domesticis suis, aut propinquis, aut fratribus, filiisque committat,
ut per hujusmodi personas occulte caeterae laedantur ecclesiae, Synodo
provinciae poenas iste persolvat. Si autem and aliter accusetur Episcopus, aut
Presbyteri, qui cum ipso sunt, quod ea quae pertinent ad ecclesiam, vel ex
agris, vel ex alia qualibet Ecclesiastica facultate sibimet usurpent, ita ut ex
hoc affligantur quidem pauperes, criminationi vero, and blasphemiis tam sermo
praedicationis, quam hi qui dispensant, taliter exponantur, and hos oportet
corrigi, sancta Synodo, id quod condecet, approbante.

Prosper proceeds further, and will not suffer that a Minister able to live
of himself should participate any thing of Church goods. Nec illi qui sua
possidentes, etc. For says he, They which have of their own, and yet desire to
have somewhat given them of that whereon the poor should live, do not receive
it without great sin. The holy Ghost speaking of Clerks (or Clergymen)
says, They eat the sins of my people. But as they which have nothing of their
own, receive the food they have need of, and not the sins: so they which have
of their own receive not the food (which they abound with) but the sins of
other men.

Therefore though the Council of Antioch, An. 340. Can. 25. ordained that the
Bishops might distribute the Church goods, yet would it not suffer them to take
any portion thereof to the use of themselves, or of the Priests and brethren
that lived with them, unless necessity did justly require it, using the words
of the Apostle, 1 Timothy 6.8. habentes victum and tegumentum his contenti sumus;
having food and raiment let us be there with contented. And decreed further,
that if the Bishops should not be satisfied, but did employ any goods of the
Church, to their kindred, brethren, or children, they should answer it at the
next Synod. So likewise touching Priests, as the words subsequent imply: and as
Achilles Statius expounds it, page 14. for the Priests at that time had
nothing but by the assignment of the Bishops: and if the Bishops themselves
might take no more then only for their necessity, we may easily judge what the
inferior Clergy might do.

But Gregory looking upon 2 Thessalonians. 3.7, 8. where it is said, You ought to
follow us, we take no bread of any man for naught; and that he which will not
work, should not eat: applies these to the Clergy, and concludes that though
such kind of Ministers have never so much need, yet they must not participate
the food of their function or Church Revenues; for says he, Pensemus cujus
damnationis sit, etc. let us think with our selves how great damnation it is to
receive the reward of labor without labor. Behold, we (the Clergy) live of
the oblations of the faithful; but what? do we labor to get the goods and
cattle of the faithful? do we take those things for our wages which the
faithful have offered for the redemption of their sins; and do we not
earnestly labor as we ought to do, against those sins, by industry of prayer
and preaching?

For the next Ages of the church, Note.
what the Author intended further will be supplied by himself in the 20.
chap. following, collecting out of diverse Councels several canons touching
tithes: but for our own church of England he does abundantly express himself
in his first Tome of our English Councels; out of which see the collections
here following, cap. 27. and much also may be observed out of Mr Seldom in his
History, c. 6. where he shows when Tithes began to be commanded by Laws and
Synods, and withal gives the reason out of Agobardus a very learned Bishop of
Lions (as he truly says of him) why Councels did not at first make canons
touching Tithes and gifts to the church: which Agobardus speaks touching
general Councels; but Provincial Councels did frequently command them, as
will appear by the collections following here, cap. 20. Agobardus words are
considerable, in his Book De dispensatione contra sacrilegos, p. 176. Jam vero
de donandis rebus and ordinandis ecclesiis, nihil unquam in Synodis constitutum
est, nihil a sanctir patribus public praedicatum: nulla enim compulit
necessitas, fervente ubique religiosa devotione, and amore illustrandi
ecclesias ultro aestuante, etc.

Concerning giving of goods, and endowing of churches, nothing has over been
decreed in Councels, nothing publicly promulgated by the holy Fathers, for no
necessity required it, the religious devotion, and love of beautifying the
churches every where abounding of their own accord. At first religious
christians sold all their lands, Acts 4.34, 35.
goods, houses, and possessions, laying down the money at the Apostles feet,
Acts 2.45. and long after the Apostles time devotion and zeal in this kind was
so fervent, that there was no need of laws, but when this zeal began to wax
cold in the next Ages following, then laws and canons were made more carefully
for Tithes and maintenance.

Many Kings and Princes also were so pious and careful, that the full tenth
should be paid, that they made several laws to pay a ninth part, that so they
might be sure to pay more rather then less then a tenth: Ex propensiori in
Deum animo ultra decimas, nonas dabant pii: As this Author proves by very
many laws alleged in his learned Glossary, which shall be produced in due
place and time: and cap. 11. here following prudently observes: How many
things in the beginning both of the Law and Gospel, were admitted, and omitted
for the present, and reformed afterward: for when the Law was given, the wheels
thereof could not presently fall into their course; and so likewise in the New
Testament, the Apostles themselves are compelled to many necessities, and to
suffer many things which were reformed afterward.

To which discourse I leave the Reader, who may thence receive satisfaction,
why laws and canons for Tithes and maintenance were not made in the first Ages
so exactly and carefully as afterward they were enacted both by Temporal and
Ecclesiastical powers.

But as others also observe for succeeding times; Churches and Tithes were both
miserably overthrown and lost in most of these Western parts of the Empire, by
the Invasion of the barbarous people, Hunnes, Goths, and Vandals, upon the
Christian world, who first invading Italy under the Emperor Justinian, did
miserably spoil and harrow the Country, persecuted the Clergy, pulled down
Churches, robbed Bishops, and Colleges, overthrew schools of learning, and
committed all sorts of wickedness: and afterward they set their face against
France, where to oppose them Charles Martell would not encounter, unless the
inferior Clergy would yield up their Tithes into his hands to pay his Armies
and Soldiers: for which sacrilege he is infamous in the public Histories to
this day, especially because he did not restore the Tithes to the Clergy,
according to his solemn promise, after God had blessed him with good success,
killing many thousands in one great battle. This fact of Martell was done
about the year 660. Chr. and no redress of it till the Council of Lateran,
near five hundred years after, Anno 1189. under Alexander the third; and this
was the first violence that ever Tithes suffered in the Christian world, after
they left the Land of Jewry and came to inhabit among Christians. But by that
foot of Charles Martell it appears, that the Clergy in his time did hold and
receive Tithes, and doubtless by virtue of laws and canons made in former
times, (witness the Council of Mascon, Anno 586.) and not so late as about
the year 800. which some do pretend. For that Council of Mascon, Can. 5. does
affirm, and take them as due by authority and laws of ancient times, and also
by the Word of God, and that they were paid by the whole multitude of
Christians. So the words of the Canon are expressly. Leges divinae consulentes
sacerdotibus ac ministris ecclesiarum pro haereditaria portione omni populo
praeceperunt decimas fructuum suorum, -- quas leges Christianorum congeries
long is temporibus custodivit intemeratas.

Here is no small testimony as well of ancient practice in paying of them, as
of great opinion, for their being due; says M. Seldom, ca. 5. 5. and so
Spelman, ca. 18. infra.

So also the phrase used in the fourth Council of Arles. Vt Ecclesiae
antiquitus constitutae nec decimis, nec ulla possessione priventur; and other
Provincials of that time, and Laws of Charlemain agree with it, says Mr
Seldom; and those phrases must needs refer back to ancient times. So Boniface
an Englishman, Bishop of Ments, in an Epistle to Cuthbert Archbishop of
Canterbury ( Spelman Council. p. 241.) speaks of some negligent and unworthy
Ministers that did receive Tithes and profits, but did not carefully perform
their duties: whereby it appears that Tithes were then paid, though some
unworthy men received them. And though the original right be due to God
himself, yet because he has assigned over his right to the Priests in the old
Law, and now to the Ministers of the Gospel, therefore they are to be paid to
the Priest or Minister; for he is the Steward of Gods house, and in this point
no man must respect what condition he is of: for the debt is due to his Master,
not to himself; so that whether he be good or bad, what condition soever he be
of, he stands or falls to his own Master, as Spelman shows, Cap. 14.

CAP. VII.
That the service of the Levites was clear altered from the first institution,
yet they enjoyed their Tithes.

THere be two sorts of Leviticall service: the first instituted by Moses about
the Tabernacle, Number. 1. The second by David about the Temple. In the first the
Levites were appointed over the Tabernacle and the instruments thereof to bear
it, to take it down, and set it up, Number. 50.51. to serve Aaron and his sons,
and to do the service of the Tabernacle, and keep the instruments thereof,
Numb. 3.6, 7, 8.

The Levites that belonged to this service in general were 8580. men, between
the age of 30. and 50. years, and the chiefest occasion of their service was
upon the removing of the host: for better ordering whereof, it was divided
amongst them into three parts.

The 1. to the Kohathites, Numb. 3. The 2. to the Gershomites. The 3. to the
Merarites.
First, the Kohathites were 2750. men, and their office was about the
Sanctuary, Numb. 4.36. or Holiest of all, Number. 4.4. under the government of
Eleazar the Priest, Numb. 3.32. to bear the Ark of the testimony, and all the
instruments of the Sanctuary. The covering vail, (which divided the Sanctuary
and the Holiest of all) the Table of shewbread, the dishes, the incense, the
incensecups, the goblets, and coverings to cover it with, and the bread that
shall be thereon continually, Number. 4.
v. 7. the Candlestick, with the Lamps, Snuffers, Snuffe-dishes, and the oil
Vessels thereunto belonging, v. 9. the golden Altar for incense, v. 11. and the
instruments wherewith they minister in the Sanctuary, v. 12. The Altar (of
burnt-offering) with the instruments thereof which they occupy about it, viz.
the censers, the flesh-hooks, and the basins, (even) all the instruments of the
Altar, v. 14. But these being the holiest things, were to be taken down and
trussed up by the Priests, some of them in blew silk, some in scarlet, some in
purple cloth, all in badgers skins, and the bars and carriages to be put to
them by the Priests, as is prescribed, Numb. 4. and then the Cohathites came
and bare them away, but touch them they might not lest they die, v. 15. nor see
them when they were folded up, v. 20. and Aaron was to appoint what part every
man should bear, v. 19.

The Gershomites were 2630. men, Number. 4.40. under the hand of Ithamar the
Priest, the other son of Aaron. Their office was to bear the curtains of the
Tabernacle, and the Tabernacle of the congregation, his covering and the
covering of badgers skins, that is on high upon it, and the vail of the door of
the Tabernacle of the Congregation, v. 25. the curtain also of the Court which
is near the Tabernacle and near the Altar round about, with their cords and all
the instruments for their service, and all that is made for them, v. 26. Aaron
to appoint every man his charge, v. 27. and watch, v. 28.

The Merarites were 3200. men, v. 44. under Ithamar also, Exodus 26.15.
and they had in charge the boards of the Tabernacle with the bars thereof,
and his pillars, and his sockets, v. 31. And the pillars round about the Court,
with their sockets, and their pins, and their cords with all their instruments,
even for all their service, to be reckoned by name (or Inventory) and the
instruments of their office and charge, v. 32. Exodus 4. and Exodus ca. 3.

This was the office and charge of the Levites as they were simply Levites, and
not Priests also: and for their service in this kind, were they judged worthy
of the Tithes of all Israel. But when Solomon had builded the Temple and there
settled the Ark, the Altars, and all the holy implements, this business of
theirs was merely at an end: for those holy things were now no more to be
carried up and down. David therefore foreseeing it, transposed the Levites to
new offices; before they were Levites of the Tabernacle; now he makes some of
them Levites of the Temple, and other Provincial Levites: according to which
is the speech that Josiah uses to the Levites: Put the holy Ark in the house
which Solomon the son of David King of Israel did build; it shall be no more a
burden upon your shoulders; serve now the Lord your God, and his people Israel,
2 Chronicles. 35.3.

1. Of the Levites of the Temple.
The Levites of the Temple were those that served about the Temple, and were
(as I say) instituted by David, but inducted by Solomon. David's bloody hands
might not build the Temple of peace, 1 Chronicles. 22.8. he prepared the treasure
and stuff for the building, the men and the manner for the order of the
service, ( ib. v. 14. c. seq.) but Solomon performed the work. The Levites of
the Temple were of two sorts, one Levites and Priests, the other Levites only:
In the function of the Priests, he changed little save the place of their
service, not the manner; before they served in the Sanctuary of the Tabernacle,
now he removes them to the Sanctuary of the Temple.

But to avoid confusion (because the posterity of Aaron was by this time (that
is, in 600. years) exceedingly multiplied) he divided the Priests into 24.
ranks or courses, according to the names of their families, as you may read, 1 Chronicles. 24.7. appointing them their turns and times of attendance, which as it
seems, 2 Chronicles. 23.8. (and as Praecepit eis ut unaquaeque generatio
ministrarel Deo per dies octo, a Sabbatho usque ad Sabbathum. Joseph. Antiq. l.
7. cap. 15. p. 389.
Josephus explaineth it) was from one sabbath to another, therefore the Greek
translation calls these turns or courses, (...) and (...), which Theophylact
says is, hebdomia, a week: Hereupon Zacharias is said to be of the rank or
course of Abiah (which was the 8. rank) and to execute the Priests office, and
burn incense as his turn came, Luke 1.

The other Levites of the Temple; that is, those that were simply Levites and
not Priests; namely, such as descended not of the line of Aaron, he divided
into 3. parts: one to be singers; another to be porters, and take the charge of
the gates of the Temple; the third to be keepers of the Treasury.

The singers to be divided as the Priests, into 24. ranks or courses; The
porters into 5. parts, one part to every of the 4. gates of the Temple, and the
fifth to Asuppim, i. e. the Councell-house.

Their Treasury was generally committed to one as the chief, but under him, to
2. sorts of other officers, one to keep the Treasures of the house of the Lord,
(that is, that were given to the maintenance of the Temple) v. 22. and the
other to keep the dedicate things, v. 26. and 28. But I find that the Treasury
was divided into 3. parts: one called Mesark, wherein were laid up donaria
principum, the gifts of Kings and Princes; the second Corban, in which were
donaria sacerdotum, the offerings of the Priests; and the third Gazophylacium,
pro donariis transeuntium, for the offerings of the people in general, into
which it seems the poor widow cast her mite. Eos vero qui erant de germine
Mosis, eminentius honoravit; fecit eos aute^ custodes thesaurorum Dei, atque
vasorum quae reges Deo dicare contigerit. Antlq. l. 7. c. 15. page 390.
Josephus says that with this office of the Treasury, as the most eminent,
David honored the offspring of Moses.

2. Of the Provincial Levites.
The Provincial Levites are those whom he severed from the Temple, and placed
abroad in the Country to be rulers over the people, both in matters pertaining
to God, and the affairs of the King, that is, spiritually and temporally; some
to be Judges, some to be other Officers in the Commonwealth: 1700. of them he
set on the West Side of Jordan, and 2700. on the East Side, chief Fathers, and
all worthy men, Chron. 26.30. and 32. Iudices autem populi and scribas eorum
6000. Antiq. l. 7. c. 15. p. 389.
Josephus counts the Levites of this kind with their Scribes, as he calls
them, to be 6000. whereby it appears that the sect of the Scribes belonged to
the Judges.

Thus David made a new form of the service of the Levites, far differing from
the first: yet the Tithes appointed to the first, remained over to the second
sort: and those that meddled not with the Temple and holy things, namely, the
Provincial Levites, had their part in the Tithe as well as the Templar
Levites; and therefore as the alteration of the service, whereto they were
first ordained, took not away the wages allotted to them: so the second
alteration of their service, namely, this of the Gospel, ought not to take from
the Levites thereof, our Ministers, the Tithe before paid to the two former
kind of Levites; I mean them of the Tabernacle, and of the Temple. The Templar
Levites were delivered from bearing the burden of the Tabernacle, and yet had
the Tithes; therefore the Levites of the Gospel must have their Tithes, though
they be delivered from bearing the burden of the Law, and ceremonies thereof.

Though this distinction of Templar and Provincial Levites may seem new to
some men, Note.
yet it is plainly grounded upon the Text, and is very material to be observed
for many purposes. At first whiles the number of the Levites and Priests was
not very great, they all attended at the Tabernacle at Shilo, first, or
elsewhere: But when the Temple was built by Solomon, and that Tribe greatly
increased, they attended by courses, (which was before designed by David, 1 Chronicles. 23. etc.) and then it fell out but one week in an half year to each to
attend at the Temple: for the Priests being divided into 24. courses, and so
likewise the Levites into 24. no course could come oftener about, then once in
24. months, or a week in every half year, which indeed was their usage, as
Josephus shows; and so Scaliger and Salianus, with other accurate
Chronologers.

Now the whole Tribe being so mightily increased in David's time, as that there
were 38. thousand Levites besides the Priests, 1 Chronicles. 23.3. Magnus sane
numerus pro isto populo, ut facile intelligas multos ornatui magis serviisse
quam necessitati: as Grotius there says.

Therefore God employed them for many uses more then to attend at the Temple:
some were designed for other employments in the Commonwealth, and they applied
other studies, as being the chief men for nobility and dignity, and also for
learning and knowledge in that Commonwealth.

Cum pingue haberent otium, non tantum omnia legis, sed and medicinae,
aliarumque artium diligentes ediscebant, ut and Aegyptii sacerdotes, ideoque
primis seculis, ex illis, ut eruditioribus Senatus 70 virum legi maxim
solebat. Grotius in Deuteronomy. 17.

There was no other Academy or School then in the whole world, but at the
Temple among them, where the knowledge of Gods law, or learning in any kind
could be gained: The administration of law and justice throughout the kingdom
depended on them principally; for God made his covenant with Levi of life and
peace. The law of truth was in his mouth. The Priests lips should preserve
knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: Mal. 2.5, 6, 7. and so
Ezekiel. 44.23. They shall teach my people the difference between the holy and
profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean: and in
controversy they shall stand in judgment, and they shall judge according to my
judgments: and they shall keep my laws, and my statutes in all mine
assemblies: they being the principal Judges and Lawyers in that Commonwealth
of Gods own constitution. And whereas it is now granted on all hands, that
there was 3. Courts of Justice in that kingdom; 1. the great Council of 70.
Elders; 2. the Court of Judgment consisting of 23. 3. the Court of three, or
some few more: the Priests and Levites were principal men, both Judges and
Officers in all Courts, Scophtim and Schoterim, as 1 Chronicles. 23.4. both to give
sentence and judgment, and also to execute the same: so the Divines do affirm
also in their late Annotations, upon 1 Chronicles. 26.29, 30. and 2 Chronicles. 19.8.11.
They did study the Judicial and Politic laws, and had power to see the law
of God, and injunctions of the King to be observed, and to order divine and
humane affairs. And they held also other honorable offices: 1 Chronicles. 26.1.
for we read that Zechariah a Levite was a wise Counselor. And Benaiah a
Priest, son of Jehoiada, 1 Chronicles. 27.5.
was one of David's twelve Captains, being the third Captain of the Host for the
third month: and in his course consisting of 2400. was his son Amizabad: 1 Chronicles. 11.22.
Benaiah was also one of David's principal Worthies, having the name among the
three Mighties. He was also Captain of the guard to David, and after the death
of Joab, he was made Lord General of the Host, by King Solomon, in Joabs
room, 1 Kings 2.35.

And because some have doubted whether they were employed in the administration
of justice, it is more clearly of late evinced then formerly has been: for
besides Sigonius, Bertram, Casaubon, Moulin, and diverse others, the learned
Hugo Grotius, in his Annotations upon Matthew, cap. 5.21. has very accurately
proved it out of the Text, Josephus, and Philo, and other monuments of the Jews
(whose testimonies at large I cannot now recite) that there was no distinction,
nor division of the Courts of Justice, the one Ecclesiastical, the other
Civil, but the Courts were united, and the Priests and Levites, the principal
Judges and officers in every Court, to whom the people were to be obedient upon
pain of death, Deuteronomy. 17.12. they being appointed to hear every cause between
blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being
matters of controversy within thy gates; and as our Lawyers call them, Pleas
of the Crown, and Common pleas, or whatsoever else did arise among them. The
Provincial Levites were especially appointed to the Courts of Justice, and
also the Templar Levites, when they had performed their courses, (and went home
to their own houses) being but one week in half a year, were at very good
leisure to assist the people in every Tribe, where their Cities were allotted
to them, in governing, ruling, and directing in all matters pertaining to God
and the King, 1 Chronicles. 26.30.32. for which purpose God did scatter them in
every Tribe, and turned the curse of Jacob into a singular blessing, Genesis 49.7.
to be divided in Jacob, and scattered in Israel, appointing 1700. to be on the
west side Jordan, and 2700. on the East Side.

The ancient frame of our Commonwealth, for 500. years before the Conquest,
was thus disposed and governed, as this learned Author shows fully in his
Glossary and Councels; and happy had it been if things had so continued still:
but now the law being otherwise settled, and the Courts divided, it is not safe,
or easy to make alteration.

Comes praesidebat foro Comitatus, non solus, sed adjunctus Episcopo; hic ut
jus divinum, ille ut humanum diceret; alterque alteri auxilio esset and
consilio: praesertim Episcopus Comiti, nam in hunc illi animadvertere saepe
licuit and errantem cohibere: idem igitur utrique territorium, and
jurisdictionis terminus: Glossar. Spelman.

The Bishop and Earl of the County were joint Magistrates in every Shire, and
did assist each other in all causes and Courts; and so Mr Seldom in his
History, cap. 14. 1. By this means there was great union and harmony between
all Judges and Officers, whereas there is now great contention for
jurisdiction, and intolerable clashing in all Courts, by injunctions,
prohibitions, consultations, and cross orders to the great vexation of the
clients and subjects.

The division of Courts seems to have proceeded first from Pope Nicholas 1. as
is mentioned in Gratian, Can. cum ad verum 96. did. about 200. years before
the Conquest, which was imitated here by William the Conqueror, whose statute
is recited and illustrated by Spelman in his Glossary and Councels, and lately
also published by Lord Cook, lib. 4. Institutes, cap. 52. But the further proof
hereof will require more then this place, or occasion will bear: only thus
much was necessary to be mentioned and asserted in regard of explication and
reference to many passages in this book, and also other parts of his works,
which perhaps are not obvious, or well observed by every common Reader. Vide
Glossar. Domini Spelman, in diatribis de Comite; de Gemottis; de Hundredo, etc.
and Concilia passim.

CAP. VIII.
The great account made of Priests in the old Law, and before.

PRiesthood is of 3. sorts. 1. That before the Law. 2. That of the Law. 3. This
of the Gospel. The first belonged to the Gentiles, the second to them of the
Circumcision, the third to us under grace. The third came in lieu of the
second, and the second rise out of the first, which was from the beginning, and
the work of nature: Erant nihilominus ea tempestate sacrdotes, nec dum adhuc a
lege ordinati, sed naturali sapientia hoc requirente and perficiente. l. 11. in
Job p. 2.
for as Origin says, natural wisdom required and established it: Abel and
Cain, before the Priests office, by the instinct of nature, not by
commandment, when each of them sacrificed, or made an oblation unto the Lord,
Genesis 4.4. their outward senses reported to them continually the great mercies
that God had showed unto them: and their inward taught them presently, that
they must be thankful, and what course was fittest to express their
thankfulness; namely, to honor him that gave all, with somewhat of his own; I
say to honor him with it, not to reward him: therefore both of them (as it is
said in Gen.) offered of their fruits; Cain like a churl, his fruits simply,
that is, his ordinary and lean stuff: but Abel like a Prince, his
first fruits, that is, his best fruits, namely, the fat, etc. Genesis 4.3, 4. Thus
was Priesthood instituted, corrupted, and reformed even in the beginning. Cain
(for ought that here appears to the contrary) began it, and likewise
corrupted it; Abel continued, and reformed it: but some rather think (and so
says Hugo) that Adam taught it to his children: and this to me seems more
likely, In Genesis 4.3.
that the better function should be derived from the better man, and not from
the bloody mind of murdering Cain.

From this fountain it ran under ground (I mean unspoken of) till the time of
Noah, and then breaking forth again, did show it self more perspicuously in his
person, for he not only offered an oblation, which he learned of his
Ancestors, but offered it also upon an Altar, which he taught his successors.

By this example of Noah, the exercise of sacrificing grew common (no doubt)
with the people of that time, and after in the confusion of languages to be
dispersed through all Nations, who losing their original faith with their
original tongue, and falling so to idolatry, applied this holy function to the
worship of idols and devils. Amongst which, notwithstanding, (as here and there
an ear of wheat, in a field of thistles) God had his servants, who from time to
time, and age to age, traducing this holy mystery (as sacred fire) to
posterity, kept it ever in the original integrity. Besides the regal Priest
Melchisedek, such were Abraham and Job, whom though the Scripture intituleth
not with that name, yet it testifies that they used the function, which
seems then to be ordinarily, though the Scripture mentions it not; for
young Isaac could talk of the fire, and wood, and ask where the Lamb was for
the burnt-offering, Genesis 22. before Abraham had made the sacrifice there spoken
of. But Abraham being first a Gentile, and after the Author of Circumcision,
brought the mystery of sacrificing, Vt non Gentes ex Iudaeis, sed Iudaei ex
Gentibus sacerdotium acceperint. Ep. ad Euagrium. Tom. 3. p. 38.
and thereby of Priesthood) from the Gentiles to them of the Circumcision; so
that (says Jerome) the Gentiles received not Priesthood from the Jews, but the
Jews from the Gentiles.

CAP. IX.
When our Savior commanded that the Disciples should take nothing with them,
but live on the charges of the faithful; this bound not the Disciples
perpetually.

When our Savior prescribed his Disciples to take nothing with them, but to
live at the charge of them into whose houses they entered; this was a law to
bind the faithful to provide for the Minister, but not to bind the Minister to
live so, and no otherwise; for though at this time he commanded them to take no
scrip with them, (that is, no necessaries) yet after he says; But now he that
has a scrip let him take it, Luke 22.36. So likewise he willed them to salute
no man, yet it was not his meaning, that afterward they should be so
uncourteous. If this had been a legal commandment to the Disciples, then
might they not vary from it, nor live in any other sort without sin. But Paul
and Barnabas left this course of maintenance and lived upon the labor of their
hands, therefore this was no binding commandment, but as a Charter of liberty
and power granted to the Disciples. They might both use and exact it, if they
would, or they might discedere de jure, and leave it if they listed. S. Paul, 1
Cor. 9. largely handles this point, and concludes it to the purpose we
allege: So (says he) the Lord ordained that they who preach the Gospel should
live of the Gospel, v. 14. But I (quoth he) have used none of these things,
neither write I these things, that it should (thus) be done unto me, v. 15. By
which words, says S. Austin, it appears that our Lord commanded not in such
sort, as they which preached the Gospel, Tom. 4.99.
might not live otherwise then by that that was ministered unto them by them to
whom they preached it: for then (says he) the Apostle did against this
commandment, that got his living with the labor of his hands, lest he should
be chargeable to any. But our Lord (says he) gave them power to do it (if
they would) that thereby they might know that these things were due unto them.
And again, a little after he adds these words; therefore when the Apostle
says, That our Lord so ordained, but for his part he used it not, he shows
manifestly, that power was given them to use it, (if they would) but no
necessity imposed of doing it, (if they would not.)

And from this distinction is the reconcilement drawn of these two places in
Scripture, which otherwise seem contrary, Mat. 10.10. and Luke 9.3. say both,
that our Lord commanded that the Disciples should not take, no not a staff
with them: but Mark 6.8. reports it, Nothing save a staff only. August, de
Consens. Eu. Tom. 4.100.
Saint Augustine therefore in the first place understands it literally, not
so much as a staff to stay or uphold them: but in the second place
figuratively, for power and authority, as if the speech had been, Take no kind
of necessaries with you, no not so much as a staff to stay you, save only the
staff of authority that I now give you.

And in that our Savior left these things to the choice of the Disciples and
Ministers, he made them Lords and freemen, for necessity imposes bondage;
Therefore Paul and Barnabas showed not only their freedom in not using that
that lay in their power, but the nobleness of their mind also that would
depend upon no body; and hereby we must not judge them to have no right to
tithes, because they omitted them also.

CAP. X.
That many things in the beginning both of the Law and the Gospel were
admitted, or omitted, for the present, or reformed afterward.

AS Painters in the beginning of their work, use rude colors, and unperfect
lines, for their present direction; so in all great mutations, many things are
for the present admitted, or omitted, which future time shall have just
occasion to reform. This in humane actions is so common, as needs no
instance: but insomuch as the holy rites themselves are not free from it,
neither in the old, nor new Testament, ir is necessary for the point in hand to
show some examples thereof.

I observe therefore three kinds of alterations, 1. Admission of things
prohibited. 2. Omission of things commanded; and 3. Reformation of things
established.

Touching the first point; plurality of wives was forbidden, yet after Lamech
had broken this institution, the children of God were permitted also to do it.
So likewise was Divorcement: yet Moses tolerated it.

None might sacrifice in the high places, or under green trees, but only in
the Tabernacle, Deuteronomy. 12.2. yet till the building of the Temple, God often
accepted it, as of Gedeon.

The Priests only might eat the shewbread, yet David and his followers did
eat it also upon necessity.

On the other side, thereof could not presently fall into their course.
Circumcision it self was not used during all the 40. years travel in the
wilderness, and happily had never been revived, if God had not commanded
Joshua to circumcise the children of Israel the second time, Jos. 5.2. Yea, the
great ceremonies of sacrifices and oblations slept all that while, the people
offered to Idols, and Aaron with them, but from the first sacrifice that Aaron
offered, at the entering into the wilderness, Lev. 9.8. etc. not one Altar
breathed unto the Lord in 40 years, Amos 5.26. Even Moses himself was buried in
this sleep. How the Passover and other Feasts were celebrated appears not,
they are seldom mentioned, and may seem therefore seldom kept. One Passover
at the going out of Egypt, Exodus 12.11. Another in the wilderness of Sinai,
God then reviving that commandment, Numb. 9.1. etc. After by Joshua at Gilgal
beyond Jordan, Jos. 3.10. and from that day till the 18. year of Josias, (that
is, above 800. years) all are passed over as obscure, except one in the time of
Solomon, 2 Chronicles. 35.13. and 2 Kings 23.2. But I must not conceal that Moses
omitteth the History of 36. years travail in the wilderness, reporting only
the punishment of him that gathered sticks on the Sabbath day, Numb. 15.32. and
therefore in that time whether it were kept or not, we can conclude nothing:
but it is plain that before Ezekias his days it was so utterly lost, that when
he came to renew it, it seemed merely a new thing, 2 Chronicles. 29. and all this
time also, was both the Temple forlorn and shut up, and all the holy rites
almost extinguished till he renewed them, ib.

For the point of Reformation; Levites were by Moses assigned to the
Tabernacle; the Priests to the Altar, but both of them confusedly without
distinction, and yet so they continued till the time of David: who to reform
this confusion, divided them into ranks, allotted a part of the service to
every rank, and assigned to them of the ranks times of attendance, and
intermission, 1 Chronicles. 23, 24, 25, 26. cap. upon which it is said that
Zacharias was of the course (or rank of Abia) and executed the Priests office,
as his course or turn came in order, Luke 1.5, and 8.

Some things also that were never commanded were brought into the old Law
afterward, and well accepted, as the act of fasting, and the habit thereof,
sackcloth and ashes.

The brazen Serpent was set up by Gods own commandment, Numb. 21.6. yet when
the people burnt incense to it, Ezekias brake it in pieces, 2 Kings 18.4.
without any commandment.

None might slay the burnt-offerings but the Priests, but when they were too
few, and till more were sanctified, the Levites did it, 2 Chronicles. 29.34.

Likewise in the New Testament, the wheels of the Gospel were not by and by in
their course. The Apostles themselves are compelled to the same necessities.

First, Jews from the doctrine at once; again, if they imposed them upon the
Gentiles, the Gentiles repined at the burden: to carry the matter therefore as
even as they might, they call a Council, and consulting upon it, they write to
the Gentiles, that they purposed not to burden them but with these necessary
things, viz. to abstain from things offered unto idols, and blood, and that
that is strangled, and from fornication, Acts 15.29. by which the Gentiles
could not complain of being burdened with ceremonies, nor the Jews that their
ceremonies were contemned. In like sort Saint James and the Elders at Jerusalem
seeing many thousand Jews to believe, and yet to be zealous of the Law, ( Act.
21.20.) they not only tolerated it for the present, but persuaded Saint Paul
(coming thither) to do the like, and further to make a show also that himself
observed the law: whereupon as before he had circumcised Timothy in show of
keeping the law, Acts 16.3. so now he also personateth a Nazarite, Numb. 6.8.
he is purified, and he is shaven (as one already) at Censhrea, Act. 21.26. and
18.18.

Thus the Apostles applied themselves to the necessity of the time, the place,
and the persons: thus Paul becomes a Proteus, a Jew to the Jews, a Gentile to
the Gentiles, weak to the weak, all to all, and all this to gain all them to
Christ, 1 Cor 9.22.

In the mean while, many things required to the establishing of the Church,
must needs be omitted; Acts 20.9. 1 Cor. 16.2. yet the first mention of it is
above 22. years after the Passion of Christ in Acts 20.7. and I suppose it to
be begun about that time, because I find that till that time the Apostles used
the Judicial Sabbath, but never after, through all the New Testament; and the
reason why they then used it was, for that the greatest Assemblies being on
that day in the Temple and Synagogues of the Jews, therefore they resorted
thither, there they preached the Gospel, there they taught the people, as if
themselves had celebrated that Sabbath. And as it was long ere they brought in
the Lords day, so in matters more remote and outward, matters belonging to the
body, they were less curious; therefore though they labored hard in the Lords
Vineyard, yet they required no wages of any man. And though Paul prescribed
that Bishops should be good housekeepers, yet few or none of them were owners
of houses, but rather as fugitives to escape persecution, or as pilgrims to
preach the Gospel.

If the law that was given in a solitary place, Judicial ceremonies that for
many years together were permitted in the cradle time of the Church, must be
taken away: Paul that then suffered them, now suppresseth them, Col. 3. Gal. 3.
ca. 4. c. 5. and the holy Ghost throughout all the Epistle to the Hebrews,
beats them down for ever.

Thus as old branches be cut off, so some new be ingraffed; the Lords day, the
Feasts of Easter and Whitsontide, not spoken of in the beginning, are brought
in at length. Deacons are ordained presently after Christ, Act. 6.2. but no
Bishops in 20. years after, nor were they then particularly ascribed every one
to his limit, but many together over one City, as at Ephesus, Act. 20.28. So
women at first were admitted to be Deacons, Conc. Laodicen. c. 11.
but time afterward wore them out. Christ commanded his Disciples that they
should not go from house to house, but Paul says, I have taught you openly,
and from house to house, Acts 20.20.

To conclude, all could not be suddenly done, nor compendiously written, that
belonged to the government of the Church, therefore the Apostles left much to
the wisdom of the Church, under this general Commission, Let all be done in
order, 1 Cor. 14.40. a few words, but of great extent, like that of the
Dictators at Rome, which being but two words, providere reipub: gave them
authority over every thing.

CAP. XI.
That upon the reasons alleged, and other here ensuing, the use of tithing was
omitted in Christ's, and the Apostles time; and these reasons are drawn, one ab
expediente, the other a necessitate.

THe greater matters thus quailing as aforesaid, it could not be chosen but
things of less importance must also be neglected; especially such as were
outward, and concerned only the body, amongst which the use of Tithing was
likewise discontinued, both in the Apostles time, and in the first age of the
Law, when the great ceremonies of Circumcision, Sacrifice, and Oblations, the
Passover, etc. and many other holy rites were suffered to sleep.

But some will say, When there shall be a place which the Lord God shall choose
to cause his name to dwell there, thither shall you bring all that I command
you; your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the offerings of
your hands, and all your special vows, which you vow unto the Lord, Deuteronomy.
12.11. these things were not respited till then, but appointed that then also
they must be performed; for it is also said, Exodus 12.21. When ye shall come
into the Land which the Lord shall give you, -- then ye shall keep this
service, i. e. of the Passover; which was done, Ios. 4.6. but yet I take this
to be discharge of it in the mean time. Quaere.
God strictly exacted not these things till the place he had chosen was
prepared for them, that is, till the building of the Temple; as it is true in
part touching the old Law, so is it likewise true in the new Law: and that
therefore Christ and the Apostles exacted not the payment of Tithes in the
first pilgrimage and warfare of the Gospel, but referred them amongst some
other things till the Church were established; for as Solomon says, Every
thing has his time, and the time was not yet come, that the Church should
demand her own, lest with Martha, she seemed curious about worldly things,
rather then as Mary to seek the spiritual.

When the Kindome was rent from Saul and given to David, David by and by sought
not the Crown, but life and liberty: so the Priesthood being rent from Levi and
given to the Church, the Church by and by required not her earthly duties, but
as David did life to grow up, and liberty to spread abroad; for love (says
Saint Paul) seeks not her own, 1 Cor. 13.5. and should then the mother of all
love (the Church) be curious herein, especially when her necessities were
otherwise so abundantly supplied?

Saint Paul makes it manifest (1 Cor. 9. throughout) where he shows, that
very much liberty, and great matters were due unto him in respect of his
Ministry, yet he concludes, I have not used this power ((...)) but on the
contrary part suffered all things, ibid. v. 12. and again, v. 15. I have used
none of all these things; But why did he not use them, since they were due unto
him? his reason is, that we (as though he spoke in the name of all the
Apostles) should not hinder the Gospel of Christ, ibid. v. 12. But why should
the taking of that was due unto him hinder the Gospel? because the malicious
backbiters would thereupon report that he rather preached it for gain, then of
zeal, and so abased his authority in the Gospel, ib. 18. whereas by this course
of taking nothing for his pains, he made it, as he says, free, ibid. and
stopped their mouths. Thus it is evident, that the Apostles not only
neglected, but absolutely refused even the things that they certainly knew to
belong unto them.

Another reason why the Apostles received no Tithes, drawn a necessitate.
The very condition of the Church in the time of the Apostles could not suffer
them to receive Tithes, for as the Levites received them not in their travel,
and ways, but when they were settled, and the Temple built: so the Apostles
being altogether in travel through all parts of the world, and in continual
warfare with the enemies of the Gospel, one while in prison, another while in
slight, always in persecution, much less could they look after Tithes, which
also were not to he paid as they needed them, but at the times and places
only, when and where they grow to be due, and one that time came, they that
were to receive them, were in another Country many hundred miles off: for

the holy Ghost, first to Seleucia in Syria, then to Salamis and Paphus in the
Isle of Cyprus, after from thence to Berga in Bamphilia, so to the other
Antioch in Pisidia, Acts 13. after to Iconiu^^, Lystria, Derbe, the parts of
Lycaonia. So again, to Antioch in Syria, thence to Jerusalem, and presently
back to the same Antioch, where Paul and Barnabas breaking company, Barnabas
with Mark saileth to Cypras; Paul taking Silas, travelleth through Syria and
Cilit^a, confirming the Churches. Then he comes to the Countries of Phrygia,
Galatia, Mysia; from whence being called by the holy Ghost, he leaves Asia,
and passes by Samothracia into Europe; preaches at Philippi, a City of
Macedonia, furthest Northward of all Greece: then back again, and up and down
Asia to Jerusalem again, and from thence at length to Rome; Read Acts 13.14,
15, 16. cap.

I will not speak of that, Theodoritus, and S^phroni^^ the Patriarch of
Jerusalem affirm, that after his first imprisonment at Rome he preached the
Gospel to the Britains our Countrymen, for happily he might do that at Rome.
But to come to the rest of the Apostles, Bartholomew (as Jerome witnesses
Catalog. script. Eccles. Tom. 1.) goes to the Indians, Thomas to the Medes,
Persians, Hyrcanians, and Bastrians, Matthew up and down Aethiopia, every one
of them one way or other, to carry one sound of the Gospel through all the
world, Psalm. 19. I ask now what these men should have done with their Tithes?
where they should have placed their Parsonage or Rectory? where their Cellar
for their tithe of Wines: Where the tithe Barn for the Corn? or if they had had
such places, how should they have been defended a fisce? how from the rapine of
their persecutors? Our Savior sending his Disciples but to the neighbor Towns
of Iudaea, would not suffer them to encumber themselves with carrying any
thing. And therefore the Apostles had great reason to eschew all impediments in
these their turbulent and long peregrinations.

CAP. XII.
That Ministers must have plenty.

THose that would have Ministers live of alms and benevolence, make their
reason, that they must follow the example of Christ and the Apostles; but by
the example of Christ and the Apostles they are taught to abound in all works
of charity themselves, to feed the hungry, to cloth the naked, lodge the
harbourlesse, etc. and how shall they perform this, living in want? 5000. did
Christ feed at one time, Joh. 6.10. Mat. 14.21. above 4000. at another time,
Mat. 15.38. and even herein are his Ministers bound to follow him, not in the
miracle, but in showing like mercy and compassion: for he faith not, I desire
to do a miracle, but I have compassion on this people, Mat. 15.32. and
therefore lest his merciful disposition toward them should be unprofitable
(wanting then other means) he chose rather to perform it by a miracle, then to
leave it undone; yet to show that all ordinary means must first therein be
used, as far as it may be, he neither called for Manna from heaven, nor quails
from the sea, ( Exo. 16.13. Numb. 11.31.) but begins the feasts by ordinary
means, the one with 5. loaves and 2. fishes, the other with 7. and a few little
fishes. In which example of charity and hospitality, the Ministers I say are
bound to follow him as far as they can; for the commandment is Sequere me,
Follow thou me, Mark 10.21. and cap. 5.27. Ioh. 21.19. and if the Minister be
not able to follow him for worldly wants (as the Galatians would have given
Paul their eyes, so) the Congregation must give him their legs, that is, means
and faculty to do it: for the arm of working of miracles is now taken from our
mother the Church, and therefore her children must now strengthen her hand the
more abundantly to work by ordinary means, that is, they must furnish her with
worldly necessaries, whereby she may be enabled to perform these great works of
charity required of her.

Paul commands that the Bishops should be (...), hospitales, 1 Timothy 3.2.
good housekeepers, and how should they be so, if they have not provision and
means to maintain it, and that in a certain manner? for if themselves be fed at
the trencher of benevolence, what assurance have they of a dish of meat for
their poor brethren? The heavens themselves are unstable; now it raineth, and
we have abundance, then comes drought, and all is in scarcity. The humor of
man is as variable; the people of Lystra that made a god of Paul on the one
day, stoned him on the other, Acts 14. and in the fiery time it self, when zeal
was most inflamed, our Savior as it seems found even then a cooling blast;
when for want of ordinary supply he was fain to fetch 20d. by a miracle out of
a fishes mouth to serve his need withal, Mat. 17.27.

It is merely therefore unfit that Ministers should live upon benevolence and
uncertainty: therefore though Christ and the Apostles lived so for the present,
yet it is not prescribed as a perpetual law to the succeeding Ministers.

CAP. XIII.
Not to give less then the Tenth.

IF those that ministered without the vail of the Temple were worthy of the
tenth part, how much more deserved they that minister in the Sanctuary? the
Levites might not come within the vail, that is, into the first Tabernacle, or
holy place, Heb. 9.2. nor meddle with the ceremonies, but did only the outward
work and drudgery of the Lords house, as to bear the burdens, prepare the
wood, the water, fire, vessels, and instruments for the sacrifice and holy
rites, kill, dress, and flea the bullocks and beasts for the burnt sacrifice,
yet even in this by the rules of equity they deserved a tenth part of the
increase of the Land; yea, the Ministry of the Priests themselves was but in
earthly and transitory things, as in types and ceremonies to foreshew a better
Testament, yet because their vocation was more honorable then the rest of the
Levites, as being called into the Sanctuary, and to perform the holy
ceremonies, therefore they received a more honorable portion; for first, they
had the Tithe of their brethren the Levites part, that is, the tenth part of
the tithe of all the land, which because they were but few in respect of the
whole Tribe of the Levites, as not the 40. part perhaps, therefore the
allowance of every one of them was much greater then of any other Levite; and
yet to increase it, they had the first fruits, and their portions and fees out
of the sacrifice and other offerings, and all these great allowances had they
for their service about the earthly Sanctuary, or as it is called in the
Epistle to the Hebrews, 9.1. the worldly Tabernacle.

Come then unto the Ministers and Clergy of our Church, look upon them with the
eye of common equity, compare them with the Leviticall Ministry, what
proportion their deserts hold one to the other: surely though it be an axiom^
of Philosophy, yet it holds also in Divinity, that Eadem est ratio partium
qua est totius, there is the same reason of the parts that is of the whole;
therefore if the Priesthood of our Savior be much more excellent then that of
Aaron, and the Ministration of the Gospel, then that of the Law, then much more
excellent must them embers be of the Gospel, then of the Law. And as their
calling is more honorable, so is their charge, as having the care of souls
committed to them, for which they must give a stract account: the Levite and
the Leviticall Priest were free thereof, and stood only charged with the
performing the ordinary ceremonies, and no further. Their pains much more
laborious then the Levites, Though the Levite be said, 2 Chronicles. 25.3. to teach
all Israel, yet it seems not that they expounded the Word of God unto the
people, or had it in charge so to do, but that they instructed them how to
carry themselves in their sacrifices and ceremonies: therefore Jerome
translateth this place, Davitis quoque ad quorum eruditionem omnis Israel
sanctificabatur Domino.
who neither were burdened with preaching, nor served any where, but in the
Temple at Jerusalem, and not above a week at a time, and notwithstanding had
their corrodary, or allowance in the vacation. If then the Levite and Priest of
the Law had the tenth part for his entertainment, how much rather is it to be
conferred and enlarged upon the Ministers that invest us with spiritual and
heavenly blessings; that as I say are called to a more excellent sunction, and
consequently deserve a more excellent reward; that have a great charge
committed to them, and consequently much great travel and labor in
performance thereof? The Levite traveled only in body, but the Minister of
the Gospel both in body and mind: he must nor only do the part of the
Leviticall Priest, which is to perform the ordinary service, sacraments, and
rites of the Church, like the ox that treads out the corn that is brought
home, but he must be also like the Dove of the Ark, he must stie about to seek
and fetch home to his Parishoners the blessed olive branch of pence. He must be
like Solomon's Eagle, whose way it in heaven, there seeking food for his
Parishoners: and like that Eagle (that God compares himself unto Deuteronomy (...)
11.) that dresseth up her nest, floteth over her birth, stretches out her
wings, takes and bears them upon her wings, (the feeble and sick souls of
his Parishoners) always teaching, comforting strengthening, and confirming them
committed to his charge; and this shall he dearly earn the portion assigned to
him.

Some then will say this is like Simon Magus, to sell the grace of the holy
Ghost. No. Ministers must be no Merchants, they must in no case sell Doves,
(...) the holy Ghost, (Christ did drive them out of the Temple) but the people
must be just; piety, justice; and the law of nature requires that every man
render a reward to the labourer, not only ^^^^^ding to his labor, but with
respect of his function, and the quality of his person; the Minister must not
sell the breath of his mouth, but he may sell the sweat of his brows, he may
not sell his doctrine, but he may take reward for his travel. It is Gods
commandment to Adams posterity, In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread,
Genesis 3.19. much precious sweat do many worthy Ministers distill for us in
their function, which God no doubt puts up in his bottle, and therefore they
must have bread for it: much labor in reading, writing, watching, studying,
preaching, and praying, many pined and wasted here with; for much reading (the
holy Ghost says it) is a weariness to the flesh, and wills man to take heed
of it, Eccles. 12.12. and therefore if there were no more in it but so, a
worthy reward is due unto them; but besides this, they minister unto us
spiritual things, that is, things inestimable: and is it much then if we
return them temporal things? And though sometimes there may be found amongst
them, such as Judas among the twelve Apostles, and in all ages some unworthy of
that sacred calling, they being subject to humane frailties, yet tithes are not
to be denied, because they are due originally to God, who assigned them over to
the Levites in the old Testament; for he says; I have given them to them, Number.
18.24. the tithes of the children of Israel I have given to the Levites; and in
the new Testament to the Ministers of the Gospel, for they that preach the
Gospel, must live of the Gospel; they are therefore to be paid to the Priest,
or Minister, for he is the steward of Gods house, and in this point we are not
to respect what condition he is of, for the debt is due to his Master, not to
himself: so that whether he be good or bad, what condition soever he be of, he
stands or falls to his own Master.

CAP. XIV.
The Etymology, and definition of Tithe; and why a tenth rather then any other
part is to be paid.

DEcimae, and decumae, in the plural number; or decima, and decuma, in the
singular, (which Tully most uses) in Greek, (...), quasi (...), i. capacem,
says Philo: (...), a capiendo, because it comprehends all other kind of
numbers, as more largely hereafter shall appear: For which cause the Latins
used the word decimare and exdecimare, to choose and cull out the principal
things; and our own English word, Tithe, imports as much: for it comes of
the Saxon Teothh;, i. e. the tenth, which is a verbal of Teo, that signifies
to take out, as if it should admonish us that the tithe or part given to God
must be a choice or principal part.
and because this part should of all the rest be the best and the largest which
in our English we commonly call, Tithe: of the Saxon word Teothh;a, i. e. the
tenth: and Teothh;an sceattas, tithes: of the verb Teo, i. traho, extraho, and
Tiehthh;, Subtrahit, as if we should say, the choice part, or the part that is
taken and chosen from the rest for God himself, which whether it be the tenth
or not, yet it is generally comprehended in Latin under decimae, and in
English under the name Tithe. Omnia sua decimabant (says Augustine) and de
omnibus fructibus suis decimam partem detrahebant and ipsam dabant. and paulo
post. Tectum decimabant, id est, decimam partem detrahebant, and eleemosynas
dabant, Augustine. Tom. 10. p. 27. D.

Before I proceed further in this Treatise of Tithes, I hold it fit first, to
propose a definition thereof, that my discourse may be the more certain. I
define it therefore.

Tithe is the tenth part of that we lawfully possess, rendered by us unto God,
by way of thanksgiving for his blessings bestowed on us.

Or according to Hostiensis; In sum. de doci. 1. V. Vocab. Vtrius. Jur. in
verbo decima.


Decima est omnium bonorum mobilium licite quaestorum pars decima Deo data,
divina constitutione debita, (quae forte addit author vocabularii) ut
colligitur de decim. Ca. 1. and ca. Parochianos, C. nonest. Ca. tua nobis
verum. C. non sit ab homine -- vel, Raymundus.
Decima est omnium bonorum just adquisitorum talis pars Deo debita.

This definition leads us first to examine why the tenth part,

Secondly,

Thirdly,

Fourthly, viz. by way of thanksgiving.

Fifthly and lastly,

I have not read why in this matter of Tithing the tenth in number should be
rather allotted unto God, then any other: and therefore wanting a guide to
direct me, I will walk this way the more respectively; but according to mine
own apprehension I observe two reasons thereof, one Mystical, the other
Political. Touching the first, as Plato and the Pythagoneans attributed great
mysteries and observations unto numbers: so do likewise all the greatest
Doctors of the Church, and the very books of God themselves, and therefore it
is not to be thought that in this point of rendering Tithes, but the number of
10. is also respectively chosen. Multis aliis atque aliis numerorum formis
(quaedam similitudinum) in libris sanctis seponuntur, quae propter imperitiam
numeroru^ legentibus clausa sunt. De doctri. Christ. lib. 2.
S. Augustine says, that many things are not yet understood in Scripture, for
that we cannot attain unto the knowledge of the virtue or power of numbers. And
both he and Saint Jerome through their whole works continually observe great
secrets therein: so do the rest of the Fathers, and not only in the Old
Testament and Ceremonial Law, but in the New Testament also: Insomuch that I
think there is not almost any number there mentioned, out of which some
particular observation is not made. But to come to this we are in hand with.
Let us see why this was allotted to God above others, and what part in reason
is due unto him: Reason tells us certainly, the best, and the choicest:
therefore he refused the unclean beasts; the lame and the blemished things: for
as he is best worthy, so he requires the best of every thing, the blood of the
sacrifice, because it was the life: the fat, because it was the perfection of
it: to be short, the number it self allotted to him, (the tenths I mean) if the
mysteries thereof be opened, tells us, both why it was yielded, and why above
other he should require it.

It is said to signify the first and the last, the beginning and the end; it
is finis simplicium numerorum, initium compositorum; the end of simple numbers,
and the beginning of compound: the first articular number, and the last number
of single denomination. The number wherewith the progress of numeration
running as it were circularly, always ends and begins again. Repraesentat
(says Bartholomeus) merito ipsum Christum qui est A, and O. principium and
finis; that is, it worthily represents Christ who is Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the end. In these and such other respects it is also said to be
like a circle, the greatest and the perfectest body in Geometry, having neither
beginning nor ending, (as other Attributes of God.) Hermes justly named
Trismegist, laboring to describe God by the most significative resemblance
that man's wit could attain unto, said; God is like an imaginary circle, or
sphere, whose center is every where, and whose circumference no where: meaning
infinite and beyond extent. And as the circle a sphere, of all forms and bodies
is most spacious and of greatest capacity, comprehending all other, and it
self comprehended of none: so the number of 10. comprehends all numbers, and
is it self comprehended in none of them, neither is there any number beyond
it, Be Abraham Patriarch. l. 2.
but that rises out of it. Decas (says Saint Ambrose) numerum omnem
complectitur. It is the foot and base whereon all of them are founded, and it
contains not only all dimensions, but to be short, all the reasons of
Arithmetic, Geometry and Music. Therefore Philo Judaeus says, they that
first gave names unto things (for they were wise) seem to me to have named
decadem, that is, the number of 10. quasi (...), i. capacem, (...), a capiendo,
quod capiat and amplectatur omnia genera numerorum, rationum ex numeris
collectarum, proportionum, harmoniarum, rursus and concentuum, proprie
appellasse, i. e. of taking or comprehending, for that it takes or
comprehends all kinds of numbers, of reasons gathered out of numbers, of
proportions, harmonies and concordances. In this manner the number of 10.
represents unto us (as such things may) the nature of God, the perfectest,
the greatest, comprehending all, and comprehended of none, the beginning and
the end, yet infinite and without beginning or end. So that this number (10.)
this tribute money in question has (in the respects before alleged) the
apparent image of God, and therefore let us see whether it has his inscription
or not; for sure if it has his image or inscription, it is due unto him by his
own words, his own argument. The Hebrews, and from them the Graecians express
it by the letters that begin his greatest and essential name, Jehovah; Mat.
22.21.
that is, (...) and i, jod and iota. The Romans and we of the Western parts
of the world, one while by the letter X, and another while by the figures 10.
All know that the letter X signifies ten, and the learned also know, that it
likewise signifies the name of Christ; for commonly in ancient times, and to
this day in many books it is so written, X', or Xs, Xi, Xo, Xm, for Christus,
Christi, Christo, Christum: and in like manner for decimus, decimi, decimo,
decimum, in the time of the Law it was marked with the letters of the Fathers
name, in the time of grace with the Sons name. Yet the truth is, that the
letter X thus used for the name of Christ, is no Latin letter, but borrowed
from the Greek, where it signifies Ch, because it represents not only the
name, but the Cross of Christ, in which the Latin letter X, as the number and
character of ten, has also much hieroglyphicall signifition. To come to the
Arithmeticall figures that express it, which are the figure of 1, and the
cipher o, 1 signifies the same that Alpha does in Greek, that is, one. The
cipher o, presents to us, Omega, for Omega is no more but great O, and in
ancient time was noted only by circle, or cipher, and in effect still is: so
that 10. in figures expresses A and O. As A is the first letter in the Greek
Alphabet, and O the last: so in the Alphabet of Arithmetique, the figure of 1,
is the first, and the cipher o, is the last; therefore in like respect the
figures of this number of 10. signifies the first and the last, the beginning
and the end. But as the cipher o, in this respect signifies the end, so we
must mark that it is a circle, and has no end. Being therefore joined to the
figure of 1, which signifies the beginning, it shows unto us, that the
beginning is without end, and the end it self without beginning or end, both
infinite and without any limit. The first character in the figure of 10, viz.
1. begets al numbers (for it is semen numeroru^) and is begotten of none: so
that it is unus and omnis, one and all, and so do the very figures signify in
notis antiquorum, according to Valerius Probus and P. Diaconus. Therefore to
conclude, it has both the image of God, in signification of his nature, and
the inscription of his name in the frame of the characters and figures; In all
languages and with all Nations after one manner or other, as though nature her
self had taught them that this part belongs to God, which by no wit, or any
learning can be applied to, or found in any number between 2, and millions of
thousands. Reddite ergo quae sunt Caesaris Caesari, and quae sunt Dei Deo. Give
unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, Mat. 22.21. Mar. 12.17. Luke 10.25.
Joh. 13.7.
and unto God, the things that are Gods.

All that we have belongs unto him, yet is he pleased to accept a part only;
Decima omnia complectitur. Bullinger in ^. Heb.
but we must note further, that it is such a part as implies the whole,
because the whole is his. He loves not to have a piece of us simply, it must be
such a piece as comprehends all in effect; therefore when he said, Give me
thy heart, it was as much as, give me all: for he will have all or none.
Therefore in his sacrifice he specially required the head, and the tail; the
head as principium, the tail as finem; the beginning and the end of all our
actions: for so the whole is his. And in the same sense the Law of the Land did
anciently reckon those parts. For though the whole Fish Royal belongs to the
King, yet Bracton says, it suffices if he have the head and the tail; for
that in those parts the whole is implied: and consequently when we give God the
tithe, or tenth part, we put him in possession of all, yea, we put the nine
parts remaining into his protection; for the number of ten in like respect
implies the whole, Lib. de 10. praecep. fol. 75, 76. and seq. Quid si numero
isto denario universitas regu^ significata est? De C. D. lib. 20.23. Decima
hora: numerus iste legem significat quia in 10. praeceptis data est lex, in
cap. 1. Evang. Joh. Tract. 7. To. 10. Sermon. 15. de verb. Domini in Evang. Mat.
Ser. 15. Tom. 10.
as Philo Judaeus discourses it. And so also does Saint Augustine expound it,
and therefore thinks that by the 10. horns in Daniel is meant the whole
succession of Kings in the Roman Empire.

The same Father yet further says, that the number of 10. signifies the Law
of God, Quia in december praeceptis lex data est. And in another place, Denarius
legem (significat) undonarius peccatum: quia transgressio est denarii 1. The
number of 10. signifies the Law, and for that the number of 11. exceeds it,
the number of 11. signifies sin. Therefore because God hates sin, and has
made the number of 10. to be as it were the number of perfection, and
righteousness, (for so likewise does Saint Augustine term it) when he
requires the number of 10. of us, it puts us in mind, that he requires also
the fulfilling of his Laws, and the keeping of his Commandments.

That God accepted the tithe, or tenth, as, and for the whole of that whereof
it is yielded, is apparent by Gods own exposition, for when he had reserved it
to himself, as his rent out of the Land of Canaan, given by him to the children
of Israel, and assigned that rent over to the Levites for their maintenance,
yet out of that assignment, he reserved also a tithe, or tenth part, to be laid
up in the chambers of the treasure house, to be offered to himself, as it were
thereby to hold his possession, and to keep seisin of his inheritance, which in
the 18. of Number. 20. is called an heave offering: and this very heave offering,
which was as I say, but the tenth part of the tenth, that is, the 100. part of
the whole, was accepted and taken by God, as the full seisin and satisfaction
for the whole; therefore he bids Moses say to the Levites, Numb. 18.27.
-- Your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as the corn of the barn, or
as the abundance of the winepresse: that is, the tithe that you are to give,
though it be the hundredth part, yet I will accept of it, as if it were all the
corn of your barn, and of your fields, and as the whole profits, even as the
abundance of your Vineyards. In like manner also does he accept the fat of such
offerings, in the 29. v. to show unto us, that since all is his, he will have
perpetual seisin of the whole, and will not be disinherited of the least part.

Doubtless he is well pleased with this tenth part, for when he threatened the
destruction of the Land by Isaiah, he concludes, yet there shall be a tenth
part remaining as to replenish it again, and as holy seed, Isa. 6.13. he will
save his own part. We have received all things of the fullness of God,
therefore out of our fullness it is fit that we render something back unto him,
not by way of reward, but in honor of him. This number is also said to be the
number of fullness, and to signify the greatest things, wherein as numbers
have their secreta and latebras, Tom. 10. fol. 15.
to use Saint Augustines words, so has this number above all other a peculiar
secret and blessing given unto it, as if God had marked it for himself; for as
God in Hezekiah's time, 2 Chro. 31.10.
blessed the offerings and tithes in abundance, so it seems the word
abundance, (plenitudinem) Exodus 22.29. is used for the tithe and first fruits:
and it has of old been observed that in natural things, the tenth is usually
the fullest and the greatest: the tenth flood, and the tenth egg. Festus, and
many other Authors do affirm it: Lib. 4.
and to that purpose Ovid says, Vastius insurgens decimae ruit impetus undae,
i. e. The whole force of the tenth flood, wave, or billow, rising up more
hugely then all the rest, rushed into the the ship. And Valor. Flaccus terms
it, -- Decimae tumor coeduus undae, the high swelling of the tenth wave: so
likewise is it noted by Silius Ital. Lucan, Seneca. Lib. 14. Pharsal. 5. In
Agamem.


And this observation amongst the Ancients has been so notorious and
remarkable, that they commonly used the word tenth in Latin, decimus,
decumanus and decimanus, to express the greatest things; therefore in the
division of their fields, they called the greatest extent, decumanum limitem;
the greatest or chief gate in their Camp, decumanam portam; the greatest
shields, decumana scuta; and so likewise, decumanos fluctus, and decumanaova,
decumanu^ acipenserem: Cic. in Verrem.
and upon the like reason they used the word decimare, and exdecimare, for to
choose and cull out the choice and principal things, as Perrot reports. And
because in the procreation of men, and many other living creatures, the number
of 10. is most happy and effectual, as the tenth month in some, and the tenth
week in others; the Romans admired the secret virtues of this number so
superstitiously, as they canonized it among their gods by the name of Decuma,
as you may read in Tertullian, Gellius, and many other. And for this cause
Romulus closed up the year in the compass of ten months, as the time of
fullness and perfection.

I will prosecute the mysteries of this number no further, but conclude with
Philo Judaeus, Satis amplum ex se ad librum conficiendum praebet argumentum.

thereof, has work enough for a large Volume.

CAP. XV.
Who shall pay Tithe.

THe Laws and Commandments of God, are commonly given in the second person
singular; as, thou shall love the Lord thy God; thou shall not steal. And so
here, thou shall not keep back thine abundance, that is, thy first fruits and
tithes; and, thou shall give the tithe of all thy increase, etc. a Pronoun of
particularity, (thou) for the Adjectives of universality, Nullus and omnis; as
if he should say, Quia omnia Dei sunt, per quae vivit, sive terra, sive
flumina, sive semina, vel omnia quae sub calo sunt, aut super ^^los. De
rectitud. Cath. convers. Tract. Tom. 4.
None or no man shall keep back his abundance: And all men shall give the tithe
of all the increase. For it is an axiom in Logic, that, Indefinitum
aequipollet universali, Indefinite propositions are equivalent with universal:
And so every man must pay tithe; Every man, says Saint Augustine, Quia omnia
Dei sunt, per quae vivit, etc. because all things whereby he lives are Gods,
whether it be the Earth, or Rivers, or Seas, or all the things that are under,
or above the heavens. Abraham and Jacob paid tithes, and therein bound all
whosoever be of their posterity to do it. Even Levi himself, who after
received tithes of his brethren, was bound thereby, and paid them in the loins
of Abraham, (as it is said in the 7. Heb.) 400. years before he was born, and
we also as Abraham's children. For if the Levites themselves, that (as the mean
Lord, to use the Lawyers term) received tithes of their brethren, were not
freed from paying them over to the Lord Paramount, God Almighty, how much more
are all we bound of what sort and condition soever to pay them likewise? But
some happily will ask, if the Levites paid tithes? yea, they did pay the tenth
part of their living to God, as well as their brethren, as before we have
touched it in speaking of the heave offering, and as it is manifest in the 18.
of Numbers, v. 26. Speak unto the Levites (says God to Moses) and say unto
them, when ye shall take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have
given you, of them, for your inheritance, then shall you take (elevationem) an
heave offering of the same for the Lord, even the tenth part of the tithe:
which in the next verse save one, they are commanded to deliver to Aaron, Gods
general Vicar in spiritual function. And in the 10. of Nehem. it is further
said, The Priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the
Levites take tithes, and the Levites shall bring up the tenth part of the
tithes unto the house of our God, unto the chambers of the treasure house. So
then the Levites themselves paid tithes, and by their example the Clergy of our
time must do it likewise; but the question will be then, to whom? First, let
us see what became of these tithes Paramount, thus laid up in the treasury. We
must understand that the Treasury of the Temple was not particularly for that
purpose, but for the guests and offerings also whatsoever dedicated and given
to God: and I find that of this Treasury there were 3. sorts: Mesack, where the
munificent gifts of Kings and Princes were laid up: Corban, where those of the
Priests: and Gazophylacium, whereinto the people and all passengers brought
their offerings, and into which the poor widow, as it seems, cast her two
mites. I find not any particular limitation of these Treasuries, but the common
end of them all was to be employed upon things necessary for the house and
service of God, and for relief of the poor, and of orphans, Antiq. Iud. l. 4.
ca. 3.
widows, and strangers. Josephus expounds Corban, for the very gift it self
offered by them that dedicated themselves to God, as the Nazaraei, and shows
that the Priests disposed it to the needy. And to these ends must our Clergy
give and pay over their own Tithes unto God, first, in repairing and
maintaining the house and service of God, as 2 Kings 12.4. then in alms and
charitable devotion to the poor: for the poor are Gods Publicans, and by him
appointed to gather and collect this rent or custom due to him, and to carry
it into his Treasury of heaven, as the Porters thereof, there to be laid up for
our use and benefit in the world to come. De rectitud. Cath. Convers. Tom. 9.
Decima^ Deo in pauperibus vel in ecclesiis donet, says S. Augustine. Let him
give it to God either in bestowing it upon the poor, or in the Churches. Though
Christ be ascended into heaven in his person, he is still upon earth by his
Proctors and Substitutes, the poor and needy; and therefore a Father ( Jerome I
take it) answers Mary when she complained, that they had taken away the Lord;
Sustulerunt dominum, at non servum.
Oh, says he, but they have not taken away his servants, meaning the poor and
needy, on whom she might abundantly express her charity. As the Law of God
enjoined the Levite to pay tithe to the high Priest: so also the old Law of the
Land binds our Bishops themselves to pay Tithes, yea, the King himself. I
command my Sheriffs (says Ethelstane) through my Kingdom in the name of the
Lord, and of all the Saints, and upon my love, that they presently pay my own
Tithes to the uttermost, both of living things, and of the fruits of the earth;
and that the Bishops do the same of their own goods, and also my Aldermen and
Sheriffs.

Tom. 1. Council. Britan. page 402.

And the very glebe Land of the Parson himself, if it be letten to another,
must pay tithe, as was adjudged in the Kings Bench this Term Sancti Hillarii.
Quaere.

CAP. XVI.
Out of what things Tithe is to be paid.

IT is recorded in Genesis, Genesis 14.20. Heb. 7.
that Abraham before his name was changed, Gave him tithe of all. And Jacob in
the 28. ca. says: Of all that thou shall give me will I give the tenth unto
thee. V. 30.
In the 27. Lev. All the tithe of the Land of the seed of the ground, and the
fruits of the trees is the Lords, it is holy unto the Lord: and in the 14.
Deuteronomy. 22. Thou shall give the tithe of all the increase of thy seed that comes
forth of thy field year by year: that we should bring the tithes of our Land
unto the Levites, that the Levites might have the tithes (in all the Cities) of
our travel or labor. So in the 2 Chro. 31.5. they brought the tithes of all
things abundantly; and v. 6. they brought the tithes of bullocks, and sheep,
and the holy tithes, which were consecrated unto the Lord their God, i. by a
vow.

In these general precepts there needs no particular enumeratio^ of what
should be paid, they run upon the word All; and without exception, all
whatsoever the ground yields either by industry, or naturally, corn, wine,
oil, the fruits and increase of every thing, whether living or vegelative. And
more then so, for even those things that are gotten by labor and travel; for
therein we have our part of his mercy and blessing, as well as in his other
gifts and bounty. Nehem. 10.37.
And the words in Nehe. [in all the Cities] seem to extend to the
handy-crafts-men, for Citizens commonly occupy not fields, or husbandry, which
is rather proper unto the Villages and Country people: So that if Citizens
should not yield the tithe of their travel, most of them should yield nothing
at al, and no man must appear before the Lord empty, Deuteronomy. 16.16.
Exodus 23.15. for he has showed mercy upon all, and he will have some
acknowledgement from all. This upholdeth the custom of many places of England,
where the very servants pay a tithe out of their wages, some deduction being
made for apparel: and by like reason I think, that those that have Annuities
and fees, as Officers and such like, ought to yield a tithe thereof; for out of
those the King has his Subsidies and tenths, and by like, yea better reason
should God have his portion: Of all that thou shall give me, says Jacob, will
I give the tenth unto thee; and in the Gospel, the Pharisee, though braggingly,
yet according to the use of the righteous of that time, says, I give tithe of
all that I possess; as it seems, even of his goods, and dead commodities, as
of the fruits of the earth. For I suppose that the Ancients paid tithes in two
sorts, some ex praecepto, others, ex arbitrio, or placito; some by commandment
of the Law, The tenth of bullocks and sheep, and all that goes under the rod
commanded, Lev. 32.
others out of their free will and benevolence. In the 31. of the 2 Chronicles. v.
6. it is said, They brought the tithes Boum and pecudum, of oxen and sheep,
things tithed before whilst they were young, as I conceive, and not now again
to be tithed, when they were grown to their full ages. So in the 10. of Nehe.
37. they brought first fruits of their dough, yet no doubt, their dough was
tithed before in the corn it was made of: therefore I take these tithes to be
tithes ad placitum, in the election of the party, whether he will give them or
not; but if he do allot them to God, he is tied like Ananias and Sapphira to
perform them faithfully, for they then become due ex praecepto; for he that
voweth unto the Lord, is commanded not to break his promise, Numb. 30.3. And
these kind of tithes no doubt were often paid by the godly, sometime upon
general occasion, as that of Hezekiah, sometime of particular, as that
pretended by the Pharisee.

Military spoil, and the prey gotten in war is also tithable, for Abraham
tithed it to Melchisedek, and thereof, if we may depart a little out of the
circle of holy Scripture into the Histories of the Gentiles, (who even by
instinct of nature found this duty to belong unto God) we abound with examples
thereof: Herodot. Clio. lib. 1. f. 36. Livy li. 5. Pliny l. 12. c. 24
as paid by Cyrus at the taking of Sardis; by Furius Camillus, upon the
overthrow of the Veians; by Alexander the great, upon his conquest of Arabia,
when he sent a whole ship laden with frankincense for the Altars of his gods.
But occasion to speak of these shall serve me better afterward, and therefore
to return to that is more material. The example of Abraham in this point of
tithing the prey, teaches us also, that we give God a tithe out of every
accession of wealth, that he sends to us in any course whatsoever: so that
the gains of buying and selling, and the great improvement arising by
merchandise, is under this title both registered and commanded. I know not what
the rich City of London does in this kind, Melpom. l. 4. f. 267.
but I read in Herodotus, that the poor Samians yielded at one time six
talents to that purpose, and that the Siphnians out of their silver and gold
Mines sent so great a tithe to Delphos, Thalia l. 3. f. 180.
as the richest man of that age was not more worth.

St Augustine says, Vnusquisque de quali ingenio aut artificio vivit de ipso
decimam Deo in pauperibus vel in ecclesiis donet. Let every man out of the
trade or craft whatsoever heliveth by, give God the Tithe.

De rectitud. Cathol. conversat. Tractat. Tom. 9 f. 250.

CAP. XVII.
That things offered to God be holy.

I Must first explain what I mean by holy, and that is, not that they are
divine things, or like those of the Sanctuary, which none might touch save the
anointed Priests. But like the lands and possessions of the Levites mentioned
in Leviticus, -- that were said to be holy and separate from common use, and
separate from man, Levit. 27.28, 29. that is, from the injury of secular
persons, and to be only disposed to and for the service and servants of God,
defensum and munitum ab injuria hominum, N. F. de rer. divis. L. sanctum, as
the persons of Emperors and Kings are said to be holy and sacred: for as the
Altar sanctifies the offering, Mat. 23.19. so these things being offered to
God, are by this very act of oblation made holy, and taken so into his own
tuition, as they may not after be divorced. Woe be therefore to the Scribes and
Pharisees that devour widows houses, Mat. 23.14. how much more woe then unto
those that destroy the house of God, and by divorcing Christ from his Spouse
the Church, make him also a widower, and his Church a widow, and so devour both
the widows house, and the widow her self.

But some are of opinion, that the Church it self is no longer holy, then
while the service of God is in hand therein: as the Mount and the Bush were no
longer holy then while God was there: and by that reason a Church and an
Alehouse are of like sanctity, for a man may preach in an Alehouse, and
minister the Sacraments in an Alehouse, and occasion sometimes does
necessarily require it: And what is their reason hereof? why, their reason is,
that consectation of places, and of the implements belonging to the service of
God were Leviticall ceremonies, and therefore ended with the Leviticall Law.
These men reason, as if before the Leviticall Law there had been no rules of
Gods honor: and as though the Moral Law, and the Law of nature taught us
nothing therein: Does not God himself leave the precepts of the Leviticall Law,
and reason with the Israelites out of the Law of nature, Mal. 3. when he says,
will any man spoil his goddess? as if he should say, that the Law of nature
has sanctified those things that are offered unto God, and therefore will any
man violate the Law of nature? Does not Saint Paul reason also in the same
sort, when he says, Despise ye the Church of God? 1 Cor. 11.22. If I should
apply the places of Scripture that are spoken of the great reverence of the
Temple, it would be said, that that were Leviticall: but the office of the
Temple was Moral, as well as Leviticall, and therefore though these be ended,
yet the other, the Moral remains.

When Christ had cast the oxen and doves that were for the Leviticall service
out of the Temple, yet he said, that it was an house of Prayer, as figurating
that after the ceremonies were ended and gone, yet the Moral office of the
Temple to be an house of Prayer still remained. Saint Paul, 1 Cor. 11.22. when
he says, Despise ye the Church of God? speaking it as if he wondered that any
should be so irreligious, or rather sacrilegious to despise the Church; and no
man I think doubts but that this was spoken of the material Church, for he
blames them that did use unseemly drinking in the Church.

See the first Treatise, Note.
of the rights and respect due. 10. Of the three several places, and three
functions of the Temple: and how the last continues holy, for Prayer,
Doctrine, and instruction of the people: which therefore had in it no
Ceremonial implement at all.

CAP. XVIII.
Tithes must not be contemned because they were used by the Church of Rome.

IF we should reject Tithes because they were used by the Church of Rome, by
the same reason we must also reject our Churches; but the Apostles used both
the Synagogues and the Temple it self after Christ's Ascension, though they were
polluted with the doctrine and ceremonies of the Jews; and therefore we are not
to reject Tithes and other things profitable to Gods service, because the
Papists used or misused them. The Censors ordained for Gods honor were
impiously abused by Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, yet God rejected them not, but
commanded them to be still employed in some better course of his service,
namely, in making plates for the Altar, Numb. 16.38.

And by this Scripture does Hugo and Origin reprove them that judge the works
of an heretic to be burned without preserving the good things in them: and
the Altar to be pulled down wherear a Schismatique has ministered. Hugo in
Genes. 16. fol. 136. a. and Origin in Homil. 9. sup. Number. fol. 104.

God refused not the burnt-offering of Gedeon, though he made it with the
idolatrous wood of Baals grove, yea, himself commanded it so, Judge. 6.26. and
in the Gospel the offerings of the proud Pharisees were as well received into
the Treasury of the Temple as the mite of the poor widow. When Jericho was
destroyed and accursed, yet God required the gold and silver for his holy
utensils, Jos. 6.19. For though filthy gains are forbidden to be offered unto
God, yet good things because they have been abused, are not forbidden to be
offered unto him. When the pottage provided for sustenance of the children of
the Prophets was infected by him that threw in the wild gourdes, or
colloquintida, Elisha the Prophet commanded them not to be cast away, but
cleansing them from their infectious venom used them still for food of the
children, 2 Kings 4.38. So if the pottage of the Ministers have been abused
with Roman Colloquintida, purge the infection, but take not their pottage (I
mean their Tithes) from them.

Aristophanes brings in Heroules laughing to see effeminate Baccbus clad in
the Lions skin: In Ranis.
but we may well lament to see a spruce Castilio, and his masking mistress
trickt and trimmed up with those Church Livings that godly and grave men in
times past gave for maintenance of Gods service, and the Ministers thereof.

I can but wonder, what should move Flacius Illyricus (a man so conversant in
the history of the Church) to affirm, Decimas nupeius extortas per papas.
Catal. test. ter primo impositas in Council. per Pelagium Papam Anno 588.
that Tithes were lately extorted by the Popes; and that they were first
imposed by Pope Pelagius in the Council, Anno 588. unless his meaning be,
that in elder times they were paid at pleasure, and now first commanded to be
paid of duty: which construction (though contrary to the understanding of a
common Reader) if we do allow him, yet is it untrue also; for that Council
recites that they had been paid before of long time, and that by the whole
multitude of Christians, and as due by the Word of God, and consequently not at
pleasure. ( Council. Matisconense. 2. c. 5. Anno 588. Tom. 2.) So that this
Council did but revive and quicken the cold devotion of that time, and not
infer new matters unheard of before.

CAP. XIX.
That the Tradition of ancient Fathers and Councels is not lightly to be
regarded.

IT appears by diverse ancient Fathers and Councels, that Tithes were paid
long before their times in the Primitive Church, and were unto the age of the
Apostles, though little memory thereof remains in the Authors of those times.
And shall we not believe the Fathers received such instruction from their
elders? Does not God bid us ask after the days of old, and the years of so many
generations, saying, Ask thy father, and he will show thee; thine elders, and
they will tell thee? Deuteronomy. 32.7. If we shall not believe them, why should we
ask them? and why did the children of Israel complain, that their Fathers heard
not the words of the book of the Law, 2 Kings 22.13. but because they therefore
could not report it to them their children?

Shall we think nothing to be done, but what is written? does not the
Evangelist tell us, that if all were written that Christ did, he supposed the
world could not contain the books, Joh. 21.25? are not many actions of elder
time alleged in latter Scriptures, and yet no testimony of them in the former?
it is said, 1 Chro. 26.18. that Samuel, Abner, and Joab, dedicated many things
unto God, yet their story reports no such matter. Solomon is noted, 1 Chronicles.
10. to have kept a famous Passover: yet is there not a word of it in the
history of his time. Fasting was brought into the Church before Christ, and the
use also of building of Synagogues, but it appears not when, or how. Paul
alleges, that our Savior said, It is better to give, then to take, Act.
20.35. yet no Evangelist does mention it. Jude says, v. 9. that Michael and
the Devil strove for the body of Moses, yet the Old Testament notes no such
thing; how then came they by these instructions? Surely by books that are
perished, or by inspiration, or by relation of others: and doubtless the
ancient Fathers came to the knowledge of many things by all these ways. First,
by books that be perished, for it is manifest by Eusebius, Jerome, Gennadius,
and others, that the ancient Fathers saw many thousands, which are not now
extant. If by inspiration, the holy Ghost, that was sent down upon the
Apostles, and passed from one to another, returned not by and by to heaven, but
remained actually amongst the Fathers of the Primitive Church; and therefore
what they generally taught is carefully to be kept. But if they received these
things by Tradition, the very Tradition of those first ages of the Church are
much to be received; for all that time, no doubt, infinite speeches and actions
of Christ and the Apostles (whereof many were collected by Ignatius and Papias,
as Jerome reports, but now lost) were then fresh in the mouths of every man,
as not only the Fathers of that time do abundantly testify, but our own
experience also induces us to conceive; for do not we our selves hear and
believe many things to be done in the time of King Hen. 8. that never yet were
written, nor like to be?

CAP. XX.
Ancient Councels and Canons for payment of Tithes.

THe Canons attributed to the Apostles, come first in rank to be mentioned, yet
I will not insist upon them. Neither does Bellarmine (as they are now
published) maintain them to be the children of those Fathers. Yet can it not be
denied that the first 35. of them are very ancient and near the time of the
Apostles; for Dionysius Exigu. that lived within 400. years of the Apostles,
translated them out of Greek as received long before in the Eastern Church.

The fifth of those Canons ordains, that all other fruit should be sent as
first-fruit (and tithe) home to the house of the Bishop and Priests, and not to
be offered upon the Altar; adding further, that it was manifest that the
Bishops and Priests did divide it to the Deacons, and the rest of the Clerks.
And though the Greek copy in this place, calls not these fruits (...),
Tithes, yet the Canon seems to be meant thereof, for other fruit none was to
be carried to the house of the Bishop, or to be divided amongst the Priests,
and the Deacons, save offerings, tithes, and first fruits; therefore the old
Translation of the Canons out of Zonaras, expresses it tithe and first fruits.
And this fashion here received of sending these things to the house of the
Bishop, and his dividing of them among the Priests and Deacons, shows the
great antiquity of this Canon; for it appears, that the first usage was so,
and that the Ministers had menstruam sportulam, every month a basket of the
offerings and tithes for their maintenance, whereupon they were called Clerici
sportulantes, i. basket Clerks.

Vid. Cyprian. Epist. 34. and 66. Baron. anno Chapter 57. Number. 72. and 145. and
anno 58. Number. 89. And the people then offered accustomably to the Altar, and
for the maintenance of the Priests.

Concilium Agrippinenese, cap. 6. Anno 356. first decrees, that Tithes shall
be called Dei Census, Gods rent: and reciting that the third part thereof, as
was declared in the Toletan Council, belonged to the Bishops, yet according to
the Roman use, they agreed to take but every year the fourth part, which upon
excommunication they commanded to be paid. Burchand. lib. 3. ca. 135.

Council. Romanum 4. sub Damaso, Damas. pa. patrim. adiit, 367.
about the year 375. amongst the Decrees thereof it is ordained, ut decimae
atque primitiae a fidelibus darentur, qui detrectant anathemate feriantur; that
tithes and first fruits should be paid by the faithful.

Council. Aurelianense 1. sub Symmacho, An. 507. Can. 17. decrees, that the
Bishops shall have every year the fourth part, or every fourth year the whole
tithe, Tom. 2. Con.

Concilium Tarraconense sub Hormisda, An. 517. Can. 8. juxta Burchandum, 9.
juxta Bin. says, that it was an Order, antiquae consuetudinis, that the Bishop
should have the third part of all things yearly, and therefore willed it still
to be kept. Burchard lib. 3. Ca. 33. Bin. Tom. 2. Conc.

Concilium Mediomatricis, Anno wills the Bishops to reprove (prohibeant) them
that would not pay Tithe without some reward be given them. Bur. l. 3. C. 134.

Concilium Toletanum, Anno 533. divides all Church rights into two sorts of
oblations, one to be those that are offered ( i. e. given) to the Parish
Churches, as Lands, Vineyards, bondmen, etc. and wills that these should be
wholly in the ordering of the Bishops. The other to be those of the Altar,
whereof it commanded the third part to be carried to the Bishop, and two parts
to be for the Clerks. And of Tithes it says, that according to some, the third
part yearly, or every third year the whole was so paid. But that they following
the manner of the Roman Church, decreed, that the Bishops should have every
year the fourth part, or every fourth year the whole tithe. Burchard lib. 3. C.
136. and Bin. paulo aliter Tom. 1.

In a collection of Canons of an uncertain Author, in the Vatican Library, this
is attributed to Sylvester, who was Bishop of Rome 315. Binnius in a note upon
this Canon somewhat differs in words.

Concilium Matisconense 2. sub Pelagio 2. Anno 588. affirms Tithes to be due
by the Laws of God; Hoc. confirm. Con. Hispalens. Tom. 2. Et approbat. per
Gualter. and Hospinian. de origin. honorum ecclesiae, ca. 3. p. 123.
that the whole multitude of Christians kept those Laws very warily of long
time, that by little and little they were in those days almost wholly
neglected. And this Council decrees, that the ancient usage of the faithful
should be revived, and that all the people should bring in their Tithes to
them that ministered the ceremonies of the Church, etc. otherwise to be
excommunicated. Tom. 2. Con.

Concilium Hispalense sub Gregorio 1. Anno 590. concludes thus: That if any
mantithe not all these things ( viz. before named) he is a spoiler of God, a
thief, and a robber, and the cursings that God put upon Cain for his deceitful
dividing, are cast likewise upon him. Ivo. p. 2. and 174. Tom. 2. Council.

Council. Valentinum sub Leone 4. Anno 858. ca. 10. That all faithful men
should with all readiness offer their ninths, and tithes to God of all that
they possess, etc. upon peril of excommunication. Tom. 3. Con.

Council. Rothoma. cap. 3. names particularly what ought to be tithed, and
commands to do it upon pain of excommunication. Burchard li. 3. ca. 130. and
annexeth the Council, Mogunt. ca. 38.

Council. Cavallon. ca. 18. Anno 813. That Bishops, Abbots, and religious
persons should pay them to Churches out of their possessions, and families
where they baptized and received. Burch. lib. 3. ca. 132.

And Council. Cavallon. c. 1. decrees, that all Churches with their whole
livings and tithes should be wholly in the power of the Bishops, and to be
ordered and disposed by him: Burchard lib. 3. ca. 146.

Council. Moguntin. 1. ca. 8. recited by Burchard, who lived about 6^0. years
since, says, that Abraham by his action, and Jacob by his promise declared
unto us, that tithe was to be given to God; The Law has since confirmed it,
and all the holy Doctor are mindful of it, etc. Hereof the venerable Doctor
Saint Augustine says, Tithes are required as a debt: What if God should say
(quoth he) thy self a man art mine, and so forth as follows in that Sermon of
his that hereafter we exhibit. The Council proceeds further, showing reasons
why Tithes should be paid. That if the Jews were so careful inexecuting this
commandment, as they would not omit it in the least things, mint, and rue,
etc. as our Savior testifies; how much more ought the people of the Gospel to
perform it, that has a greater number of Priests, and a more sincere manner of
Sacraments? They are therefore to be given unto God, that being better pleased
with this devotion, he may give more liberally the things we have need of. That
this kind of maintenance is fittest for the Clergy, that they otherwise be not
troubled with worldly business, but may attend their calling.

That the daily offerings of the people, and that Tithes are to be divided into
four parts, according to the Canons; The first to the Bishop, another to the
Minister or Priest, (Clericorum) the third to the poor, the fourth to repairing
of Churches. Burchard li. 3. c. 133.

Council. Moguntin. 1. cap. 10. tempore Appae 4. and 4. Lothar. Imp. Anno 847.
sub Rabano Archiepiscopo qui scribit Ludovice. This Council admonishes men to
pay their Tithe carefully, because God himself appointed it to be paid to
himself. And that it is to be feared, that if any man take Gods right from him,
God for his sins will take things necessary from him also. Tom. 3. Conc.

Roman. Council. 5. Anno 1078. Tom. 3. says, that Laymen upon pain of
sacrilege, excommunication, and damnation, might not possess Tithes, and
Church livings, though granted by Kings and Bishops, but must restore them.

CAP. XXI.
In what right tithes are due: and first of the law of nature.

WE have said in our definition, that they be due unto God: now we are to show
by what right, and to prove it. First, therefore, I divide Tithes into two
sorts, Moral, and Leviticall; Moral, are those which were due to God before
the Law given in the time of nature. Leviticall, are those nine parts assigned
by God himself, (upon giving the Law) unto the Levites for their maintenance,
the tenth part being still reserved to himself, and retained in his own hands.
Moral tithes were paid by man unto God, absque praecepto, without any
commandment; Leviticall tithes were paid by the Israelites unto the Levites,
as transacted and set over by God unto them pro tempore for the time being, and
that by an express Canon of the Ceremonial law. To speak in the phrase of
Lawyers, and to make a case of it; God is originally seized of tithes to his
own use, in dominico suo, ut de feodo, in his own demesne, as of fee-simple, or
as I may say, Jure Coronae, and being so seized by his Charter dated, (...)
year after the Flood, he granted them over to the Levites, and the issue male
of their body lawfully begotten, to hold of himself in Frank-Almoigne, by the
service of his Altar and Tabernacle, rendering yearly unto him the tenth part
thereof: So that the Levites are merely Tenants in tail, the reversion
expectant to the Donor, and consequently their issue failing, and the
consideration and services being extinct and determined, the thing granted is
to revert to the Donor, and then is God seized again as in his first estate, of
all the ten parts in fee.

But we must prove the parts of the case: and first, the title, namely, that he
was seized in fee of original Tithes, that is, that original Tithes do for
ever belong unto him. Hear the evidence: which I will divide into three parts,
as grounding it first upon the law of Nature; secondly, upon the Law of God;
and thirdly, upon the Law of Nations.

CAP. XXII.
How far forth they be due by the Law of Nature.

When I said by the Law of Nature, my meaning is not to tie my self to that
same jus natural, defined by Justinian; which is common to beasts, as well as
to men. But to nature taken in the sense that Tully after the opinion of
others, delivers it to be, -- Vim rationis atque ordinis participem, Denat.
Deo. l. 2.
tanquam via progredientem declarantemque, quid, cujusque causa, res efficiat,
quid sequatur, etc. the virtue and power of reason and order, that goes before
us as a guide in the way, and shows us, what it is that works all things,
the end why, and what thereupon ensues or depends. This by some is called
the Law of Nature, secondary or special, because it belongs only to
reasonable creatures, and not generally to all living things; in respect
whereof it is also called the law of reason, and it is written in the heart of
every man, by the instinct of nature, Quis scribit in cordibus hominum
naturalem legem nisi Deus? Aug. de sermon. Domini in monte l. 2.
as Isidor faith, (not by any legal constitution) teaching and instructing all
Nations through the whole world to discern between good and evil, and to
affect the one as leading to the perfection of worldly felicity, and to eschew
the other, as the opposite thereof. This is that law written in the hearts of
the Heathen, made them to be a law unto themselves, as it is said, Romans 2.14.
and by the instinct of nature, to do the very works of the Law of God, with
admirable integrity and resolution. This is that Law that led them to the
knowledge of God that they had, whereby they confess him to be the Creator,
supporter, and preserver of all things, seeing all things, knowing all things,
and doing whatsoever pleases himself, to be omnipotent, eternal, infinite,
incomprehensible, without beginning or end, good, perfect, just, hating evil,
and ever doing good, a blessed Spirit, and as Plato calls him, (...), the
greatest Spirit, that gives all good things unto man, that guides his
actions, and blesses his labors: All this and much more, did the very Heathen
by this Law of Nature, conceive and pronounce of God, and therewithal
confessed, that by reason thereof they were justly tied to yield him all
service, honor, obedience, praise, and thanksgiving; but wanting grace to
direct them above nature in the right ways thereof, they first swarved on one
hand, then on the other, and at length they fell into their innumerable
superstitions and idolatries; yet as they concurred with us in these
fundamental points of Christian confession, touching the nature of God, so did
they likewise in the fundamental course of serving and worshipping him; as by
prayer, to crave blessings; by hymns, to celebrate his praise; by oblations,
to show their thankfulness to him; by sacrifice, to make atonement with him
for their sins and trespasses; by honoring and maintaining his servants,
Priests, and Ministers, to express the honor, love, and reverence they bear
unto himself. Some are of opinion that they learned much of this from the
children of God. So Ambrose alleges, that Plato did of Jeremy the Prophet,
meeting him in Egypt; but it appears that Jeremy lived before Plato almost
300. years: yet it is doubtless, that with their blood and lineage they
deducted many particular rites and ceremonies from Noah and his Nephews: but
these notions I speak of, rise out of the very law of nature written in their
hearts by the finger of God, as S. Augustine witnesses, saying, Quis scribit
in cordibus hominum naturalem legem nisi ipse Deus? who writes the law of
nature in the hearts of men but God himself? Instit. l. 1. C. 3.
and Calvin agrees, that the knowledge of God is naturally planted in the
minds of all men; Do we not see at this day, the very barbarous, and (almost)
savage Indians, agree in effect, most of them, aforesaid touching the nature of
God, and the course of worshipping him also, yea, in the five ways we spoke of,
viz. by prayer, by songs, by offerings, by sacrifice, and by honoring and
maintaining his Priests and servants? who taught them this, if not the very law
of nature? Me thinks I hear some answer me, the Devil; and I must answer them,
that it is true, the Devil taught them to pervert these notions, but it is God
that wrote them originally in their heart, though the Devil has choked and
corrupted them. But say that the Heathen learned these of the children of God,
Calv. Iast. l. 1. c. 4.
whence did the children of God learn it themselves, before the Law was given?
who taught Cain and Abel to offer their first fruits, and to sacrifice? Abraham
and Jacob to give tithes of all that they had? Lactantius says, that the law
of nature taught to give offerings to God, and the practice of all the Nations
of the world, in all ages, and in all religions confirms it. As soon as
Christ was born, the wise men that came afar off out of the East, brought
offerings unto him, as directed only by the law of nature, for they were
Gentiles: and none used to visit the Temple of God but with some presents; not
that God is delighted with such things, but that their affections by the fruits
of their devotion were made manifest, It seems this law of nature is termed
by Moses the Law of God, for he says, I declare the Ordinances of God, and his
Laws, Exodus 18.16. when as yet the Law was not given: and before, ca. 15.26. If
Israel will hearken to his Commandments and keep his Ordinances, c. 19.5.
the Church and service of God maintained, and those that were in need and
necessity, orphans, widows, strangers, and the poor people provided for and
relieved; for these are Gods care, and are to him as the dearest kind of his
children, and though younger brothers as touching the worldly inheritance, yet
those on whom he thinks the fat Calf well bestowed. Donum (says Lactantius)
est integritas animi: the gifts we give unto God are a testimony of our frank
and open heart toward him. An offering of a free heart (says David) will I
give unto thee: out of his abundance we have received all things, and out of
ours let us render some.

CAP. XXIII.
Tithes in the time of Nature: first considered in the time of Paradise.

I Would not be so curious as to seek the institution of tithes in Paradise:
yet no man will deny but that Paradise was a model of the Church, and that God
had his honourary rights in all the three kinds, he now requires them at our
hands, namely, a portion of time, place, and of the fruits; of the fruits, as
the tree of knowledge; of the place, as the midst of the Garden; the time, as
the cool of the day, which signifies the time of rest, and so the Lords day:
as more particularly we shall show by and by. Touching the fruit, it was the
portion that God reserved from Adam when he gave him all the rest; and that
portion also that justly and properly belongs to God, knowledge. And
therefore this part particularly was assigned by God unto his Priests, as the
sacred keepers of this his sacred Treasure, and therefore no other man might
invade this his right and inheritance, Knowledge (says Malachi) belongs to
the Priest. Touching place, what should be assigned to the chiefest, but the
chiefest? and what is the best and chiefest, but the midst? for medium -- and
therefore the place here where Gods portion is assigned him, is the midst of
the Garden; and therefore into this place does Adam fly as into Sanctuary, and
to the horns of the Altar, when he had offended, for it is said, that Adam hid
himself in the midst of the Garden: So Calvin, which is, the trees in the midst
of the Garden.

And touching the time, it is by all expositors upon the matter, applied to the
time of rest: for either they expound the cool of the day to be the evening, as
Oncalus, or the morning, as Calvin; and take it in either of these senses, it
may aptly discover the Judaicall Sabbath in the first sense, or the Christians
Sabbath in the latter. And as these are the times when we are to make our
public reckonings, confessions, and prayers unto God, and thereupon to receive
sentence of curse or absolution: so at this time, presently God calls Adam
and Eve, and the Serpent, that is, the whole congregation of Paradise to a
public reckoning, confession, and account; and like the great Ordinary and
Bishop of his Church, denounces against them the curse that their sins had
demerited.

If occasion required, I could show many other particulars wherein Paradise
exemplified the very Church of Christ.

Again, these rights of honor are likewise prefigured unto us in other
examples, under the age of Nature, the time I mean before the flood: for we
have therein three great examples of all these his three rights. First, in the
creation of the earth he reserved a particular place for himself as the place
of his own resort and pleasure, Paradise; which was the very local place of
his Church, and therefore out thereof he threw man, being accursed as a
profane and excommunicate person. And as touching his portion of time, he
figuratively showed the seventh part of our age to belong unto him, as in
respect of his Sabbath, when he took Enoch, being the seventh from Adam, to
keep his perpetual Sabbath.

And so likewise all the fruits of the tenth age, which was that of Noah (for
he was the tenth from Adam) he took wholly to himself: making the evil parts
as a sacrifice of his wrath, to honor him by their destruction, and the better
parts, which were saved in the Ark of his Church, to glorify his name by their
preservation: so that in this time of nature, the full tenth of all things was
paid unto God as a propitiatory sacrifice, for of the ten ages from Adam he
had the fruits of one whole age, which is all one as if he had had the tenth
part of every particular thing as it grew due in every particular age, and so
the Church expounds in that Canon of the Council of (...) where it is
commanded that the --

CAP. XXIV.
The time of Nature, after the fall.

LEt us take a view of the state of Religion before the Law, and from thence
unto the calling of the Levites to the service of the Tabernacle. The time
before the Law was the kingdom of sin and of death, having no means propounded
whereby to escape, but what the light and law of nature taught unto men, who
finding themselves fallen from the favor devised by invocation and beating of
the heavens, with continual odours and savours to seek for mercy at Gods hand,
and by sacrificing of bullocks and brute beasts to ransom themselves as far as
they might from his heavy displeasure. Therefore in those times though every
man might offer oblations and sacrifices that would, yet because the order
thereof might be the more certain and reverent, both the children of God, and
the Heathen also, ordained to themselves particular persons of greatest worth,
wisdom, and sanctity, which they called their Priests to take care of these
things, to see them performed in such manner as might make them most acceptable
to God. Hereby grew the reputation of Priesthood to be above all dignities,
that in those days the Kings themselves in all Nations affected it as the
greatest and immediate honor under God himself. Yet because necessity required
so great a number of Priests for the service of God, as there could not be had
Kings enough for that purpose, therefore other inferior persons were also
called to that excellent function; yet such as in one respect or other were
still the noblest that were to be found. Therefore even in that time (I mean
before the Law was given) God promises the Israelites that if they will hear
his voice indeed, and keep his covenant, they shall not only be his chiefest
treasure upon earth, but they shall be unto him also a kingdom of Priests,
Exodus 29.5, and 6.

Of these kingly Priests, two are mentioned in Scripture before the Law;
Melchisedek Priest and King of Salem, and Revel or Jethro, Prince and Priest of
Midian. Exodus 16. and (...)
Of other Priests it appears in Exodus 19.22. and 24. that there were many.
Let the Priests (says God) that come to the Lord be sanctified; and again, Let
not the Priests break their bounds, etc.

Touching these Priests we find no mention either how they were called to
their function, or how they were maintained in it; neither of them that
executed that place after the Law was given till the calling of the Levites,
which though it were a short time, as not above a year and some months, yet
must they have some maintenance and means to live on even during that time. The
Priests of Egypt had not only lands for their maintenance, but they also had
a certain part appointed them by Pharaoh to live upon; and though it appears
not by the Scripture what this part was, yet it is plain, that it was such, and
so bountiful, as when all the other Egyptians sold their land to Joseph for
Pharaoh to save their lives in the famine, they lived upon this part and kept
their lands.

The children of God (no doubt) came not behind the Heathen in devotion, and
consequently not in their bounty to their Priests; therefore though we have no
authority to demonstrate unto us the particular means wherein they were
provided for, before the Law, yet we may very probably conceive it to be much
after the manner of the Heathen Priests of that time, for that the Priests and
children of God being then scattered amongst the Heathen, as Melchisedek among
the Canaanites, Jethro amongst the Midianites, could use no rites nor
ceremonies in the worship of the true God, but the Heathen would have the same
in the service of their gods: insomuch as nothing is mentioned in the Scripture
concerning the same before the Leviticall Institutions, but it is particularly
found among the Gentiles first, touching both their Priests and manner of
sanctifying of them, as also touching their offerings, altars, and sacrifices,
and the manner of feasting at the sacrifice of thanksgiving used by Jethro,
Exodus 18.12.

I infer therefore, that seeing the Heathen took their original manner of holy
rites from the children of God, that therefore what original rites the Heathen
had in their service of their religion, that the same were in use also among
the children of God, though they be not mentioned in the Scripture: and
consequently, that insomuch as the Heathen universally paid Tithes and
first fruits unto their Gods and Priests, that therefore the children of God
did so likewise from the beginning to the true God. And to this agrees Hugo
Cardinalis, saying, It is thought that Adam taught his sons to offer
first fruits and tenths unto God: so that the children of God borrowed it not
from the Heathen, or the Heathen from them, but both the one and the other from
the law of nature; for as Ambrose says, God therefore by Moses followed not
the fashion of the Gentiles: Non ergo Deus per Mosem Gentilium formam sequutus
est; sed ipsa naturalis ratio hoc habet, ut quis inde vivat ubi laborat, in
Epist. 1 Cor. ca. 9. C. 41. Col. c.

And as the examples of Abraham and Jacob do plainly confirm it to be done by
them, so doubtless was it also done by other of the Hebrews, even before the
Leviticall Institutions, and even then holden and taken to be a duty belonging
unto God, as plainly appears by Gods own mouth in 22. Exodus 29. when he
says, and that before the Leviticall Institutions: Thine abundance and thy
liquor shall thou not keep back: which all Interpreters agree to be spoken of
the Tithe and first fruits of corn, oil, and wine, and therefore Jerome doubted
not so to translate it, viz. Thy tithes and first fruits shall thou not keep
back: wherein the word keep back, non tardabis, is very materially to be
considered, as evidently showing, that it was a custom of old to pay these
tithes unto the Lord, and therefore that he now required them not as a new
thing, but as due unto him by an ancient usage. That the word non tardabis,
thou shall not keep back, or delay, implies a thing formerly due, very reason
tells us, and the use of it in other parts of Scripture does confirm it, for
the very same word (...) is used in the same sense, Deuteronomy. 23.21. When thou
vowest a vow unto the Lord thy God, non tardabis, thou shall not be slack to
pay it, or shall not keep it back: this is not a commandment to pay or give a
new thing, but to pay that is already due, the thing vowed. In the same sense
it is said, 2 Pet. 3.9. non tardat Dominus promissa, the Lord is not slack in
performing his promise, that is, not slack, or holding that back which in his
honor and justice he has tied himself to pay or perform; the blessing he
promised, which by his promise is made a debt.

CAP. XXV.
That they are due by the Law of God.

IT is said in Genesis in the end of the 13. ca. and so on in the 14. and in
the 7. to the Hebrews, That whilst Abraham dwelt at Hebron, in the Plain of
Mamre, his brother Lot was carried away prisoner by the four ( Assyrian, or
Babylonian) Kings, with all that he had, and that Abraham confederate with
Mamre the Amorite and his brethren, Escol and Aner, armed his household, even
the bondmen as well as free, 318. in all, and pursued them unto Dan, where he
smote them in the night, and recovered Lot and the prey: And that as he
returned, Melchisedek King of Salem, Priest of the most high God, met him, and
gave him bread and wine, and blessed him, In the Hebrew text it is indefinite
which of them gave tithe ^o other; therefore the Jews say Melchisedek gave it
to Abraham, but the holy Ghost in the 7. to the Hebrews explaineth it, that
Abraham gave them to Melchisedek.
and prayed and praised God for him: and that Abraham did thereupon give him
the tithe of all. This place of Scripture is very material for our purpose, as
portraiting unto us the whole model or platform of the Church now under the
Gospel, even as if the one were measured out by the other, with a line, or rod,
as Moses measured the Tabernacle, and as if God had said as he did unto Moses,
See that thou make it in all things like the pattern I have showed thee, Exodus
25.40. the last. We will therefore stay a while upon it, and consider the
action, the time, the place, the persons, and some other circumstances. The
action, as having nothing in it belonging to the Leviticall Law, Codomannus
says in the year 293. some other count it above 370.
and therefore a plain direction unto us how to demean our selves under the
Gospel. The time, as performed before the Law was given, namely, about 300.
years after the flood, both according to the rites (...) that time, and to be
president for the time to come after the Law abolished. The places where this
action was performed, Hebron, Dan, and Salem; Hebron, a place in Judah where
Abraham dwelt afterward, one of the Leviticall Cities, from whence Abraham
departed, when he went into this expedition. Dan, the uttermost limit of the
holy land, whither Abraham pursued his enemies, and there slew and chased them.
Salem, the place where Melchisedek was King, which by reason of Josephus his
mistaking it, Melchised. Dei sacerdos, Solymorum quam civitatem post^a
Hierosolymam vocarunt. Ios. Antiq. l. 1. c. 18. Hieron. in Ep. ad Euagr. et ^n
loc. Heb. Lyra in Genesis 33.
is commonly taken to be Jerusalem, but erroneously, as Jerome and Lyra explain
it: for Saint Hierome out of the ancient Rabbis shows it to be a Town near
(...) so called in his time, and men then showing the ruins of Melchisedeks
Palace in great magnificence. S. John also does witness it to be Enon, a known
Town in Jeromes time near Jordan, where the spring was that John Baptist
baptized in: John also (says he) baptized at Elim, besides Salem, Joh. 3.23.
because there was much water there: So that the first door that was opened
into the Kingdom of heaven by the preaching of the Gospel, the first
administration of the Sacrament of Baptism, as S. John here reports it, was
within the territories of the Kingdom of Salem, that is, by interpretation,
the Kingdom of peace and righteousness, which Baptism brings by washing
away original sin.

The persons are, Melchisedek, Abraham and his confederates, and family.
Melchisedek is the image of Christ, King of righteousness and peace, the
Priest of the high God, and a Priest for ever; for the Scripture neither
shows his beginning, nor his ending. A Priest, not anointed with material
oil, after the ceremony of the Leviticall Law, not ordained for a time as
Aaron, but established with an oath by God himself to be for ever: and
sanctified with the spiritual oil of gladness above all the ranks and orders
of Leviticall Priesthood. Abraham an Hebrew and representing the rest of the
Hebrews, Gods chosen people: Father of the Jews by Circumcision, and by faith
the Father of the Gentiles. So that Melchisedek prefigurated the whole
Priesthood of Christian Religion, and Abraham the whole Laity; therefore
Chrysostom says, Considera quanta sit excellentia nostratis sacerdotii
quandoquidem Abraham Patriarcha Iudaeorum progenitor Levitarum comperitur
benedictionem accipere a Melchisedec. Orat. 4. advers. Iud. Sedita Paulus ipse.
His confederates, Mamre, Escol, Aner, Amorites and Gentiles, representing the
whole body of the Gentiles. The family of Abraham, as well bondmen as
freemen, all mingled together, and all here marching as under one ensign, not
of the Leviticall Law, which only belonged to the Jew, but of the New
Testament, embracing both Jew and Gentile, bondmen and freemen, the children
of Hagar as well as Sarah. Their enemies are the idolatrous Assyrians or
Babylonians, who spoil the people of God, and these Abraham pursues, kills,
and chaseth beyond Dan, that is, out of the Church.

To apply and moral this to the Church under the Gospel: They that are the
true children and consorts of Abraham, whether Hebrews or Gentiles, free or
bond, who now are all alike, they must depart out of the Leviticall Cities,
that is, the Ordinances and Ceremonies of the Law: they must fight against the
four great Kings, the enemies of Lot, and of the children of God; Sin, Flesh,
the World, and the Devil. So Hugo expounds them, Superbia vitae,
Concupiscentia carnis, Hypocrisis, Avaritia vel concupiscentia aculoru^. Hugo.
they must chase and cast them not only out of the temple of their heart, but
out of the compass and bounds of the Church of Christ, and so kill and subdue
them by faith and repentance, even when they are asleep, and thereby seem to
have surest possession of them. Having thus conquered, Melchisedek, our Savior
Christ, will meet them in their return, but where? not till they come within
the territories of Salem, into the bounds of the Church by the sacrament of
Baptism; And then he will not stay till he be called and wakened, as he did in
the ship with Peter, but as he is our (...), Multo post futurum Domini
sacramentum ante signavit, ac sacrificio panis and vini mysterium corporis and
sanguinis expressit. p. To. 4.14. c.
he will come forth of himself and meet them, and give them bread and wine, as
Melchisedek did, to strengthen and confirm them, that is, the other sacrament
of the body and blood. Then as a perpetual high Priest and Mediator he does
bless them, and make intercession for them, as Melchisedek did Abraham, and
his spiritual posterity in the person of Abraham, as well Jews as Gentiles;
for in the person of Abraham, Melchisedek blessed both, the Jews as his
children by Circumcision, and the Gentiles as his children by faith. Then must
we do as Abraham did in his own and our person, give tithe of all to
Melchisedek and his Substitutes. Melchisedek gave bread and wine really, and we
must also as Abraham did, give him the tithe really. And this tithe was not
given to Melchisedek as a Leviticall duty, but as a duty belonging to God both
before the Law, Ministravitist^ Melchisedek Abrahamo and exercitui xenia, and
multam abundantiam rerum optimarum simul exhibuit, and super epulas eum
collaudare coepit and benedicere Deum qui ei subdiderat inimicos. Jos.
Antiquit. l. 1. c. 18.
and in the time of the Gospel: for Melchisedek met not Abraham with oblations
and sacrifice, like a Priest of the Law, but with bread and wine, the elements
of the sacrament of the Gospel, which in figure thereof are only remembered in
this place by the holy Ghost; though Josephus mentions many other rich gifts
at this very time plentifully given by Melchisedek to Abraham: So that if
Melchisedek in the person of Christ received tithe, then doubtless is tithe
due unto Christ, and consequently to his Ministers.

This is the first place in Scripture wherein tithes be mentioned, therefore
some may think it the first time they were paid, but that is no argument; for
so it is the first place where a Priest is mentioned, yet no doubt Priests were
before. Noah performed the Priests office when he built an Altar, No fish, as
though the curse extended not to the sea.
and offered of every clean beast, and fowl upon it, Genesis 8.20. And it is very
likely that Melchisedek himself had borne the office of a Priest many hundred
years before he met Abraham, though the Scripture does not mention him till the
meeting; for if it be lawful to enquire of that the holy Ghost reveals not,
many great Divines are of opinion, that he was Sem the son of Noah; (whom the
Salemites had made their King) and it may well be, for it appears in Genesis 11.
that Sem lived 600. years, whereof 502. after the Flood, and of them 209. in
the life of Abraham: So that to those of that new world that Abraham lived in,
(I mean after the Flood) he might well seem without father or mother, or any
beginning, being born almost 100. years before the Flood, and to have been a
Priest for ever. And then in like consequence he might have received tithes of
diverse other before he thus met Abraham: for that use was common long before
among the Heathen, and likely it is, that the Heathen rather learned it of the
children of God, then that the children of God should learn it of them, as
Hemmingius would have it, who says, that Abraham gave these tithes of his own
accord, following therein (without all doubt) the manner of Conquerors, which
were wont to consecrate the tithe of the spoil unto their gods, or to bestow it
upon their Priests. I read in Ovid, that Bacchus who lived before this time,
having conquered the Indians, and other Nations, sent the first fruits of the
spoil magno Jovi, to great Jupiter: but whether Abraham either heard of it, or
took it for a Precedent, that cannot I tell.

Te memor ant Gange totoque orient subacto
Primitial magno supposuisse Jovi.
Cinnama tu primus captivaque thura dedisti,
Deque triumphate viscera tosta bove.
Fastor. li. 3. The next place of Scripture mentioning tithes is the 28. Genesis
ver. the last. Jacob going upon his adventure, voweth, that if God will be with
him in his journey, and give him meat and cloth, and so that he return safe,
then (says he) the Lord shall be my God, and this stone which I here set up as
a pillar shall be Gods house, and of all that thou shall give me, will I give
the tenth unto thee. Live. l. 1.
Romulus made the like vow for building the Temple to Jupiter Feretrius upon
Mount Palatine. Tatius and Tarquinius upon Tarpeius. William the Conqueror for
Battle Abbey. But Hemmingius cannot say that Jacob did it by their example,
for they lived too too long after him. I think rather that the law of nature
and reason taught all Nations to render honor, thanks, and service unto God,
and that the children of God being more illuminate in the true course thereof,
then the Heathen by the light of reason could be, first began the precedent,
and that then the Heathen dwelling round about them apprehended and dispersed
it; for the use of paying tithes even in those first ages of the world was
general, as hereafter shall appear. But Jacob does not here bargain and
condition with God, that if God will do thus and thus, that then he shall be
his God, and that he will build him an house, and pay him tithe, and otherwise
not, but he alleges it as showing by this means he shall be the better
enabled to perform those debts and duties that he owes unto God, and will
therefore do it the more readily.

The actions and answers of the Sages are in all Laws a law to their posterity.
Justinian the Emperor does therefore make them a part of the Civil Law. The
common Lawyers do so allege them, and the Law of the holy Church has always
so received and allowed them. Non ideonobis proponi exempla justorum, ut ab eis
justificemur; sed ut eos imitantes, ab eorum justificatore nos quoque
justificari sciamus. Aug. lib. de Catechisand. udibus. Tom. 4. f. 218.
And though Saint Augustine says, that the examples of the righteous are not
set forth unto us, that thereby we should be justified; yet he adds further,
that they are set forth to the end that we by imitating them may know our
selves to be justified by him that justifies them. Why then should we now call
tithes in question, since we find them to be paid and confirmed by two such
great Sages and Patriarchs, Abraham and Jacob? Yea, their payment practiced
generally by all the Nations of the world for 3000. years at least, never
abrogated by any Law, but confirmed also by all the Fathers and Doctors of the
Church; and not impugned by a single Author, as far as I can find during all
the time I speak of?

Well; It will be said, that all this is nothing, if the Word of God commands
it not; for every thing must be weighed and valued by the shekel of the
Sanctuary, Lev. 27.25. They may by the same reason take away our Churches, for
I find not in all the Bible any Text wherein it is commanded that we should
build us Churches: Perkins them. Problem. 9.
neither did the Christians either in the Apostles time, nor 100. years after,
build themselves Churches like these of ours, but contented themselves at first
to meet in houses, which thereupon were called ades sacrae. And to show that
they were commanded by the Levitical Law, will not serve our turn, for it will
be said, the Statute of repeal, even the two words spoken by our Savior upon
the Cross, Consummatum est, John 19.30. clearly abrogated that Law: but it is
to be well examined, how far this repeal extends: for though the letter of it
be taken away, yet the spiritual sense thereof remains; for Jerome says,
Singulae paene syllabae, etc. spirant coelestia sacramenta. Tom. 3. Paulino
Epist.
that almost every syllable thereof breaths forth an heavenly sacrament.
Saint Augustine says, the Christians do keep it spiritually, so that if tithe
be not given in the tenth, according to the Leviticall Institution, yet the
spiritual meaning of providing for the Clergy our Levites remains. But with
the precepts of the Leviticall and Ceremonial Laws diverse rules of the Moral
Law are also mingled: as the Laws against Witches, Not to reap every corner of
our field, nor to gather our fruit clean: not to keep the pledge that belongs
to the person of our brother.
Userers, Oppressors, etc. the Laws that command us to lend to our brother
without interest, and to sanctify the Sabbath; for though the Institution of
the Sabbath be changed, yet the spiritual observation remains, and that not
only in the manner of sanctifying it, but as touching the time also, even the
seventh day. Notwithstanding I find not, that the Apostles commanded us to
change it, but because they did change it, we take their practice to be as a
Law unto us: yet though they changed the time, they altered not the number,
that is, the seventh day. I will then reason that God has as good right to our
goods of the world, as to the days of our life: and that a part of them belong
unto him, as well as the other. And the action of Abraham and Jacob may as well
be a precedent to us for the one, (in what proportion we are to render them) as
that of the Apostles in the other; for both of them were out of the Law, the
one after it, the other before it: And why may not the limitation of the day
appointed to the Lord for his Sabbath be altered and changed, as well as the
portion appointed to him for the tenth? You will say, the seventh day was not
due to him by the law of nature, for then Abraham and the Fathers should have
kept it before the Law given, but it held the fittest analogy to that natural
duty, that we owe to the service of God; and therefore when that portion of
time was once particularly chosen by God for his service, by reason himself had
commanded it under the Law, the Apostles, after the Law was abolished, retained
it in the Gospel: And so since the number of the tenth was both given to God
before the Law, and required by him in the time of the Law, being also most
consonant to all other respects, great reason it is to hold it in the age of
the Gospel. Yet with this difference, that in the old Law the Sabbath was the
last part of the seven days, and in the Gospel it is the first, because our
Savior rose from the dead the first day of the week, and not the seventh.

God is our Lord, and we owe him both rent and service: our service is
appointed to be due every seventh day, our rent to be the tenth part of our
increase. He deals not like the hard Landlords, that will have their rent
though their Tenants be losers by their Land, but he requires nothing save
out of their gain, and but the tenth part thereof only. These two retributions
of rendering him the seventh day of our life, and the tenth part of our goods,
are a plain demonstration to us, of our spiritual and temporal duty toward
God. Spiritually, in keeping the Sabbath, and temporally, in payment of tithes,
that is, in providing for his Ministry, and them in necessity; the one being
the image of our faith, the other of our works: for seven is the number of
spiritual sanctification, ten the number of legal justification. Therefore to
pay all the nine parts was nothing, if we failed in the tenth; for the tenth is
the number of perfection, and therefore required above all other as the type of
legal justification. And as our faith is nothing without works, so neither is
the Sabbath without tithes: for they that minister to us the spiritual
blessings of the Sabbath, must receive from us the temporal gratuities of
Tithing.

CAP. XXVI.
That they are due by the Law of Nations.

THe Law of Nations is that which groundeth it self upon such manifest rules of
reason, as all the Nations of the world perceive them to be just, and do
therefore admit them as effectually by the instinct of nature as if they had
been concluded of by an universal Parliament. Therefore in truth, this is no
other, but that which the Philosophers call the law of Nature; Orators, the
law of Reason; Divines, the Moral law; and Civilians, the Law of Nations. As
far then as Tithe is due by one of these, so far likewise it is due by all the
rest: and consequently the reasons that prove it in the one, do in like manner
prove it in all the other. I will not therefore insist here upon arguments, but
remit you to that has been formerly said touching the law of Nature, and
demonstrate unto you by the practice of all Nations, what the resolution of the
world has been herein through all ages.

So ancient it is among the Heathens, that good Divines are of opinion, that
Abraham took example thereof from the Heathen: but others with more reason
conceive it to be practiced even by the children of Adam as well as sacrificing
and the offering of first fruits, as by the opinion of Hugo Cardinalis I have
showed in another place.

Besides, I find not any mention of Tithe paid by the Gentiles, before the time
of Dionysius commonly called Bacchus, who having conquered the Indians sent a
Present of the spoil Magno Jovi, as Ovid witnesses; and this was about 600.
after that Abraham tithed to Melchisedek.

Cyrus having collected a great sum of money amongst his captives, caused it to
be divided, and delivered the tithe thereof to the Praetors, to be consecrated
to Apollo, and Diana of Ephesus, as he had vowed. Xenophon in Cyro. l. 5.

Alexander the great having conquered the Countries of sweet odours and
frankincense sent a whole ship-loading thereof to Leonides in Greece, that he
might burn it bountifully unto the Gods. Plin. li. 12. c. 24.

Posthumous having overthrown the Latins, paid the tithes of the spoil, as
before he had vowed. Dionys. Halicar. li. 6. Livius. Largissime nimis.


Nebuchodonosor did the like (too bountifully as Josephus reports it) to the
Temple of Belus. Ant. l. 10. C. 13.

Rhodopis a Thracian woman, before the time of Cyrus, gave the tenth part of
all her goods unto Delphos. Herodot. Euterpe, page 139.

The Crotoniati warring upon the Locrenses, vowed the tenth part of the spoil
to Apollo: but the Locrians, to exceed them in their vow, vowed the ninth part.
Alex. ab Alex. 165.

Agis King of Lacedaemon went to Delphos, and there offered his Tithe unto God.
Xenephon de rebus gestis Grae. li. 3.

Agesilaus conquered so much of his enemies Country, that in two years he
dedicated above an hundred talents to God for the Tithe. Xenoph. de Agesil.
laud.

The Liparians having overcome the Hetruscians in many sea battails, sent the
Tithe of the spoil to Delphos. Diodor. 292. l. 40. (...).

The custom of the ancient Gauls (and so likewise, no doubt, of our British
Ancestors) was to give all (in effect) that they got by the wars unto their
gods, as Caesar witnesses, and to sacrifice the cattle so taken. De Bell.
Gal. lib. 6.132.

And this use of Tithing the spoil obtained in war was every where so
ordinary, that Craesus the King of Lydia being overcome by Cyrus, and taken
into mercy told him, as advising him for his good, that he must of necessity
render the Tithe of the spoil unto Jove, and that he should therefore set a
guard at every gate of the City to prevent the soldiers from embezling of it.
Herodot. in Clio. li. 1. p. 36.

I reckon up these particulars the more willingly to beget shame and remorse,
if it were possible, in the soldiers of our time, that having been exceedingly
enriched in this kind, have not I fear remembered God, with so much as Craesus
did, when he sent no more but his iron shackles to Delphos. Herodot. ib. fo.
37. Yet God had 7000. servants that Elias knew not of, and therefore I will not
judge them.

As Military men abounded thus with devotion, so those of peaceable professions
came not behind them; for Festus witnesses, lib. 4. p. 213. l. 67. That they
of the old world offered every tenth thing unto God; and Varro in his Book, De
re Rustica, advises every man to pay his Tithes diligently of the fruits of
his ground.

Therefore because the Sicilians were more happy in corn, then other Nations,
they exceeded all other in thankfulness to Ceres, as appears by Diodor. Sic.
288. in pede, etc.

And for that the Athenians were next in that felicity, they did the like, and
instituted further in her honor, initia Eleusina, i. the feast of the
first fruits, which for the great antiquity and holiness thereof were, as
Diodorus reports, celebrated of all the people of the world.

Pliny says, the Arabians tithed their frankincense to their god Sabin, not by
weight, (as sparingly) but by measure, as a more bountiful manner. Lib. 12.
ca. 24. page 184. L. 57.

The Aethiopians cut not their cinnamon, but with prayers made first to their
gods, and a sacrifice of 44. Goats and Rams: and then the Priest dividing the
cinnamon, took that part belonging to their god, and left them the rest to make
merchandise of. Plin. l 12. ca. 19. fol. ^86. in pede.

The Siphnians sent at one time so great a Tithe out of their silver and gold
mines to Delphos, as the richest man of that age was not more worth. Herodot.
Thalia, lib. 3. fol. 180.

The Romans, Neque Herculi quisquam decumam v^vit unquam si sapiens factus
esset. Cic. de Not. Deor.
and generally all Nations, paid the Tithe of their fruits to Hercules, and
they held it the happyest thing to vow the payment of them faithfully: and they
thought that the cause that Lucullus abounded so much above other in wealth
was, that he paid his Tithe so faithfully. Alex. ab Alex. lib. 3.165.

As they paid their Tithes out of the fruits of the earth, so did they likewise
out of their privy gains and industry.

Herodotus writes, that the Samians (a small people) yielded at one time six
talents for the Tithe of their grain gotten by merchanchise. Melpom. li. 4.267.

And that nothing might go untithed, the Ancients paid a Tithe of the very
beasts killed in hunting, namely, the skins thereof to Diana.

So Hesodius offered the tripod he won at Amphidamas game, as the prize of

Additions to the 26. Chapter of the Law of Nations.
These Laws of the Heathens are but few of many more that might have been
collected; If any Reader therefore desire to be further satisfied touching the
practice and custom of the Gentiles, in payment of tithes, he may abundanly
receive content from M. Seldom in his History, cap. 3. and Mountague in his
Diatrib. cap. 3. out of both some collections are here added.

Some perhaps will say, it is less material to consider their doings, seeing
we Christians have the light of Israel to direct us, and the assured Word of
God to our guide; as for the customs of the Gentiles, they might in many
things imitate Gods own people, but we may have recourse to the fountain of all
truth, to him, who is the way, the truth, and the light.

It is true, but God himself has been often pleased to upbraid and provoke his
own people, by the example of a foolish and ignorant people, and to call heaven
and earth to witness against his own, when they have been obstinate and
perverse in their ways. And our Savior says, that the men of Ninive shall
rise up in judgment, and also the Queen of Sheba, against them who neglected
so great means of salvation and instruction, as the people enjoyed, when he and
his Disciples preached to them; and that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom
and Gomorrah at the last day, then for Chorazin and Bethsaida, who heard his
doctrine and saw his works.

So doubtless we Christians in this last age, in this light of learning and
sunshine of the Gospel, may learn by the examples of the very Heathens, who
were so precisely observant both of the quantity, the tenth, and of the
quality, in giving the best of the increase, which must needs proceed out of
some secret inclination unto that practice, whereof (as in many other remains
of natural notions) they knew no reason, but were secretly inclined thereto,
by that Providence which disposes all things, (...), or at least, from long
continued practice and traditions, as they had many, taken from divine
instruction at the first, though whence they had them they could not tell, not
utterly abolished and obliterated in the darkness of Pagan errors.

Paulus Diaconus, in his abridgement of Festus, does witness the general
practice of the Gentiles: Decima quaeque veteres diis suis offerebant.

Diodorus Siculus, lib. 4. says, That Hercules being very well pleased with
the kindness of the Inhabitants of Palatium, foretold them, that after his
Canonication those that would consecrate the tenth part of their substance unto
Hercules, should be very fortunate and prosperous in the whole course of their
life: which continued, says Diodorus, a custom unto my time; and he lived in
the days of Julius Caesar. And prosecuting the point, does instance in
Lucullus, and other wealthy Romans, saying, Many Romans accordingly, not only
such as were of very mean estates, but also many of the richest sort have made
these vows unto Hercules, to give him the tenth of all: and they becoming
afterward very wealthy, have accordingly given unto him the tenth, their state
amounting to M. M. M. M. Talents. L. Lucullus, well-nigh the wealthiest Roman
of his time, making an estimate of all that he was worth, gave the tenth in
oblation unto this Deity: which tenth he laid out upon many and sumptuous
feastings to his honor, gifts to his Temples, and the like.

And these Herculean Tenths were, Therumatus, of a fair eye, given with a
liberal and plentiful hand, as appears by that which Sylla, Lucullus, and
Crassus did: So Plautus uses, obsonare pollucibiliter, to riot it, and fare as
they do that sacrifice unto Hercules; and quaestus Herculeus, exceeding great
gains: which is a most sure proof how prodigally liberal these Pagans were in
paying their tithes of their never so great wealth unto their poppet gods,
having never heard of the reward of the righteous, nor happiness in heaven,
laid up for all those that so honor God. And to this does Tertullian allude,
Apologet. c. 39.
speaking of the prodigality of the Gentiles in such Feasts. Herculanarum
decimarum and polluctorum sumptus tabularii supputabunt. Which ready
forwardness of theirs, shall one day rise up in judgment, and cause it to be
easier in the day of vengeance for those Pagans that knew not God, then it will
be for many millions of Christians, that are both witty and courageous to
withhold from God his due, and defraud him of that which in his name, and for
his right sake was given unto those that intruded on his place, as an annexum
thereto amongst the Pagans.

Halicarnasseus reports, (...)
that the Pelasgi in a dearth and great scarcity of all things, vowed, upon
plenty sent unto them, to give the tenth of all that God should send unto them,
unto Jupiter, Apollo, and the Cabiri, or the Samothracian Deities: intending
that this misery and scarcity came unto them for their former neglect and
contempt of that part of piety. Upon this vow of amendment, they had their
desire; plenty was sent them, and then, setting aside the dedicate portion, the
tenth of all their increase of their grounds, and of their cattle, they
offered it unto those gods.

The perpetual use and practice amongst the Romans appears by Trebatius,
Lib. 3. Satur. 5.
who wrote (says Macrobius) de religionibus, of the religious rites and
ceremonies of the Pagans. Trebatius in that Book, as Arnobius tells us,
declares a custom yearly with the Romans; That the increase of their Vintage
was by solemn words and formalities set apart from ordinary and common use: for
until that ceremony so performed, whereby God did as it were give possession
unto men, He as the giver of all things, and so of that natural increase, had
in their opinion (and this is a most remarkable passage for the right of
Tithes, as they opined) right unto, and interest in all. Nor was it lawful
among them for any man whatsoever, to use his own as his own, though it grew
upon his own ground, was manured, tilled, sewed, set, preserved at his cost,
with his labor and diligence, until God had given him leave to do it, being
supplicated and solicited thereunto by this formal ceremony. This is the
sum of Trebatius discourse in Arnobius.

This is that which may shame and confound all Christians, that acknowledge no
such right God has, nor will be induced to profess it so: this will rise up
in judgment against all maligners at, and detainers of the Churches portion in
Tithes, Gods right, our inheritance, by better conveyance then Muncipall Laws
can afford any. Cato de re rustica, ca. 132. has the practice and the form.

Jupiter dapalis, quod tibi fieri oportet (mark the word oportet, a matter of
necessity, not of voluntary devotion) in domo, familia mea, culignam vini Dapi
ejus rei ergo. macte hac illace dape pollucenda esto. then, Hujus rei cura non
levis in Latio -- nam flamen Dialis auspicatus vindemiam, et ut vinum legere
jussit agna lovi facit. Varro.
manus interluito, vinum sumito. He that performed this ceremony, was to do
so, and then to say, Jupiter dapalis, macte istace Dape pollucenda esto: macte
vino inferio esto.

Nor did they thus appropriatly use this ceremony unto only Jupiter, but unto
what Deity soever they did, acceptum refer their increase.

Quoties aut thus, aut vinum super victimam fundebatur (says Servius)
dicebant; In 9. Aeneid.
Mactus est Taurus vino, vel thure: hoc est, cumulata est hostia; magis aucta
est hostia. And Cato has the same form of words concerning other sacrifices
besides this, cap. 130.141.134. Arnobius in zeal to Christian religion,
derideth and scoffeth at this Pagan use and ceremony; but because they did not,
recte offerre, do it to the true God: not because they did not, rite dividere,
do that which was not to be done: not the thing done, but done unto Jupiter,
and unto Idols, not to the true God of heaven and earth, was blamed. Withal he
gives us to understand, That this erroneous act of theirs, had beginning from
a true ground: That, The earth is the Lords and all that therein is; that, He
has given it to the sons of men; that it is, He that opens his hand, and
fills all things living with plenteousnesse; that tithes and first fruits are
given unto God, to recognize his supreme dominion over all: his admirable
goodness in giving us whatsoever we possess: and that by giving of them back
unto him, as it were a certain quitrent unto the Lord Paramount, thereby we
do, and not otherwise, a quire unto our selves a right unto the Remains, with
an interest therein, and not otherwise, to use them unto our own behoof; which
if we do not, we are but Usurpers and Intruders. For all the world, as the
Jews did, who might not, durst not meddle with the increase, until they had
paid God his due, and thereby purchased liberty to use their own. Thus the
Gentiles who had not the Law, by direction and light of nature though so much
obscured, yet did the things of the Law.

Concerning the Siphnians (whereof mention is made already) it is further to be
remembered, In Phoc.
what Pausanias expressly relates of them: who says, when covetousness made
them leave paying that tribute of Tithes, the sea brake in upon them and
swallowed up their mines; a just vengeance upon detainers of Divine right, by
dishonouring of God to lose all. So long as yearly they paid Tithe of the
increase, so long it was well with them: so soon as they defrauded God of his
right, God turned them in justice and vengeance out of all.

Aristotle reports, that Cypselus had a special regard to the tenth, as
competent to a Deity, when he vowed all the goods of the Citizens, Oeconom. 2.
if he could get Corinth. Aristotle was the great dictator of learning, in whom
God would remonstrate what he could do in mere Nature, without supernatural
endowments of grace; he speaks directly, That the tenth part is competent to a
Deity, and that, He vowed all the goods; but because this vow employed an
absurdity, unless he meant, which he did not intend to ruin the City, he was
fain to have recourse unto the ordinary use of Tithing: but so, that the Tithe
decies repetita, should answer the proportion of his vow: (...), having made a
rate and cessement of every man's goods and state, he took the tenth part, for
that year; and so the next for ten years together, leaving them nine parts to
trade with and live upon. Every one did not so, but every Conqueror that would
not be unthankful gave the tenth, (...), unto God; with us daily, men are not
thankful as they ought; yet they should be grateful.

Agesilaus, whiles he warred in Asia and had the spoil of that wealthy Country,
made such haveck upon the enemy, Xenophon.
that within the compass of two years, he sent more then one hundred talents,
tithes, unto Delphos, which proves an ordinary Spartane use and custom at
least.

The same Agesilaus having vanquished the Thebans, Xen. Hellen. l. 4.
and their associates, in a great battle at Coronaea, though having received
many wounds in the fight, (...), forgot not God, says Xenophon, nor to be
thankful unto God.

That Retrait which Xenophon made with his ten thousand men out of upper Asia,
is the most remarkable piece of service one of them in all Antiquity. In this
hazard, Xenophon, as himself relates it, gave decimam spoliorum, partly unto
Apollo, partly unto Diana of the Ephesians.

The tenth being separated for these two Deities, was by general consent
committed unto the Captains to be dedicated. That for Apollo was laid up at
Delphos in the Athenian Treasury ( for most Nations of Greece had a several
one there.) But with that other part, Diana's part, Xenophon purchased a piece
of ground, and built there a Temple, and an Altar, and appointed the tenth of
the yearly increase for ever unto that service. This is a passage very
considerable, there being not such an express and observable example in all
Antiquity for Tithe in this kind with an endowment of a Church with lands.
Sacred is that land unto Diana; whosoever possesses or occupies the ground,
must every year consecrate the tenth unto the service of Diana, and employ the
rest upon the fabrique and upholding of the Temple. Tithes of spoils commonly
paid amongst the Graecians, but not accustomed in this sort to be employed. A
general sacred Revenue appropriated to a special end; where besides the
profits and Revenues of this land tithed, what was purchased with the tithe at
first, unto Diana, as president of the trade, and the chiefest ranger amongst
Pagans, Tithe of Venison and Game is said in the same place to have been paid.

Diodorus Siculus in his elventh Book has three several instances, Page 2^9.
for tithing spoils of war; the first of Pausanias, and the Graecians, that
having vanquished the Persians, and slain Mardonius in the field: Set apart
the tenth of the spoils, and therewith caused a tripos of gold to be made,
which they dedicated at Delphos; no vow preceding, nor other intimation being,
but as done out of duty and ordinary profession of thankfulness.

Another of Cimon the Athenian General, Page 270.
who remaining victor at the battle upon the River Eurymedon, as Pausanias had
done, so did he, set out the tenth of the spoils, as Gods part, sacred and
dedicated unto him, to God in general, not naming Apollo, or any else.

In a third place, Page 276.
the Argivi having made the Mycenians their slaves and captives, consecrated
the tithes of all they took to God, and utterly rased the Town Mytenae.

Porphyrie declares, that first fruits were given unto God, (and what is said
of first fruits must be granted of tithes) out of devotion by the Pagans, Lib.
2. (...).
of all things useful to the life of man: as of corn, honey, wine, oil, cakes,
and what not? Those that gave nothing by way of thankfulness, out of their
increase and store, were called (...), irreligious people; not serving God,
without piety: who never escaped punishment for their Atheism. The Thoes a
people confining upon Thracia, that never used to give God first fruits of any
thing which they enjoyed, nor offered any thing at all unto the Deity, were
utterly destroyed out of the earth. The reason is well given by that profane
Porphyrie, why men give tithe, first fruits, sacrifice, and the like, out of
the secrets of Christian mysteries, (...), for all that we have or enjoy is
Gods, though the use or enjoying thereof seems to be ours, which reason being
eternal, and undeniable in nature, professed and acknowledged by Naturalists,
without light of grace, none can doubt, but that the practice in being was out
of that persuasion, and so of duty, and necessary tie, which none but (...),
and (...), as Pophyrie calls them, did neglect: and for contempt whereof,
even in opinion of Pagan Antiquity, exemplary punishment was inflicted on that
people. No men, nor City, nor stone remained, and their memorial perished from
off the earth, says Porphyrie.

The learned Greek Grammarians do testify and expound, the custom of tithing
by the Graecians, as Valerius Harpocration says: (...), for they tithe all the
spoils gotten of the enemy unto the gods. And long before Harpocration, the
learned Grammarian Didymus for his indefesse reading and writing, surnamed
(...), Ironside, or heart of Oak, says, as he is cited by Harpocration, that
properly and primarily, (...), to pay the Tithe, was (...) to sanctify,
dedicate, or consecrate unto divine service, (...), In as much as it was a
general custom amongst all the Graecians to give the tenth of any their
increase unto the gods. These two learned Grammarians did know what was the
ancient use among the Graecians, better then any man now: because they did only
hoc agere, having no other profession to distract their studies: and especially
because both of them had, especially Didymus, those helps in their days, which
none can attain now unto; the Authors being lost, whom they saw and perused,
whereby they might learn the Grecian customs more particularly.

Besides the practice of the Romans and Graecians, other barbarous Nations did
observe the Law of Tithing: For in the remains of natural understanding and
notions, the Barbarians had a part as well, and often a greater part then the
Graecians or Romans more civillized Nations had; and commonly the ancientest
customs are to be found amongst the Barbarians, and not among the Graecians,
nor Romans, as common experience observes. The Carthaginians sent the Tithes
of their Sicilian spoils unto Hercules at Tire, for Hercules was the chief
Patron and Protector of Tire, and the Carthaginians were a Tyrian Colony. Nor
did they send their Tithe once, or sometime, or as they would, out of arbitrary
devotion, but of ancient and ordinary custom, as Diodorus Siculus reports;
which growing into disuse, through negligence and disregard in long tract of
time, many dysasters in war, and other crosses in affairs of State befell them.
And thereupon to reconcile themselves, and appease Hercules, they renewed again
the forgotten custom, and sent thither not only the Tithe of the spoils, but
of all things increasing and renewing yearly. Thus much is reported by Diodorus,
where he relates into what straits the Carthaginians were driven, and into how
many hard assays, by Agathocles the Scicilian. It is a memorable place for such
piety; therefore it shall be here recited.

The Carthaginians supposing that these losses and dysasters were sent unto
them of God, betook themselves to all manner supplication and devotion; and
for so much as they supposed Hercules especially to be angry with them, who was
chiefly worshipped at Tyrus, from whence originally they were extracted, they
sent exceeding great presents and rich gifts thither. Being thence descended
they were accustomed in former times to send unto Tire the tenth for Hercules,
of all their Revenues and increase, any way renewing, issuing or growing; but
becoming in process of time very wealthy, and having exceeding great commings
in, they sent very seldom their Tithe, and that but small and refuse, unto
Tire, in neglect and disregard of the Deity. But upon this great loss, coming
home to themselves, and repenting of their irreligion, they became mindful of
the Gods, all that were worshipped at Tire, and sent unto them the tenth.

Altogether as we use to serve God. Phryx plagis. Israel when God smote them,
then they repented, returned, and honored him: but when he turned his hand,
they turned their hearts. So the Carthaginians being plagued first, returned
unto their former custom, (an ancient custom beyond the memory of man, and
yearly, not sometime) and gave willingly in abundance their tenth part of all
their commings in: not so much but of their children they gave the tenth, for
they used to sacrifice them unto Saturn, as Israel did in the Valley of Hinnom.
Old Father Ennius remembers this custom, Poeni sos solitei sont sacrificare
puellos: which custom seeing it remained unto Tiberius Caesar's time, it is not
likely they disused the other tenths.

In like manner Gelo the Sicilian having vanquished the Carthaginians in a most
memorable battle, and slain of them in the field an hundred and fifty
thousand men, the greatest blow for massacre of men, that they at any time
received in any battle: Gelo having achieved this, he reserved several and
apart the best and principal of the spoils (which cannot well be denied to be
a tenth) meaning to adorn and honor the Temple at Syracuse: of the remains he
reserved another portion (without all doubt in quantity another tenth) which he
dedicated in the principal Churches of Himera; the residue, after God had been
served, he parted among his soldiers and confederates.

Thus it appears what the custom of Tithing was among the Heathens, which
doubtless they learned as many other things, from the people of God; as the
ancient Fathers have observed touching many passages of practice in holy writ:
there especially, when they entreat, de Graecorum furtis. So the names of
Deities, and other particular usages, they received from the Hebrews, (though
with much difference and variety, both as coming far, and not well
apprehended, or understood in the carriage and delivery) so also it is very
probable, that of them the Syrians, Phoenicians, and Egyptians, first learned
to give the tenth unto God, and other holy usages, and then more remote Nations
afterward: which might well admit in passing up and down, and in long
continuance, much variety, and not fully in every point answer the prototype,
or original.

But from whence soever they received their first direction, for custom and
practice they most part went beyond Gods own people: which though it be
strange, yet so it is, that in zeal unto piety and the service of God, not
only Samaria has exceeded Jerusalem, but even Babylon put down Sion. And so
Theodoret complains, that the heathens did give their tenths and
first fruits, to be employed in their idolatrous service, to the maintenance of
their Temples, Oratories, Priests, and Altars, in more liberal manner then
Christians: but says he, (...). Such honor (says he, speaking of the care
taken for the Egyptian Priests, Genesis 47.) the Priests of the living God, and
Ministers of our Redeemer Christ Jesus have not with us. And much less have
they in these days, especially with us, who boast to have reformed things
amiss. For yet, amongst those of the Church of Rome, it is otherwise, that
think nothing too dear for their Jesuits; and have their Priests in so great
respect, that they fall down on their knees and desire their blessing every
morning: but, Nuper Tarpeio quae sedit culmine cornix,
Est been, non potuit dicere, dixit, erit.


Mr Seldom says, that the Turks pay the tenth according to the Mosaicall Law,
which they receive as authentic, but keep it according to Mahomets fancy, and
the doctrine of his Canonists.

Mr Blunt an accurate observer in his travails affirms, that the Turks in
their principal Cities have very stately Moskeetoes ( i. Churches) of
magnificent building, accommodated with goodly Colleges for the Priests
lodgings, and Bathes, equal to the Monasteries of any City in Christendom.

Aelian relates (as Mr Seldom cites him) that some kind of beasts in Africa,
always divided their spoil into eleven parts, but would eat only the ten,
leaving the eleventh as a kind of first fruits or Tithe: and why may not
beasts of the field teach men the practice of piety? seeing man that is without
understanding is compared to them.

Thus Jews, Pagans, Turks, and some beasts have had a care to pay Tithes, but
many Christians in these times come far short in their duties, and may be
upbraided with these examples: Which are here more largely insisted on, to show
the impiety of many men in these last days, who are more inexcusable, then ever
any people were, because we have the rules and practice of all ages set before
us for our direction; as before the Law of Moses, in Abraham and Jacob: and
likewise under the Law, during the Priesthood of Aaron: and since under the
Gospel abundant light to guide us: besides all the Records, Histories, and
Monuments of Gods judgments in former times to instruct us. All which (says
the Apostle, 1 Cor. 10.) are written and recorded for our admonition, upon whom
the ends of the world are come. If we therefore offend now, we are greater
sinners then any former people, as sinning against conscience, knowledge, and
examples of all ages; and like to the servant, that knew his Masters will, but
did it not, who therefore must be beaten with many stripes.

CAP. XXVII.
That they are due by the Law of the Land.

AS they are due by the law of Nature, and of Nations, by the Law of God, and
of the Church: so are they likewise due by the very Temporal Laws of the Land,
as well ancient as later; therefore Edward the elder, and Guthrun, Saxon and
Danish Kings, punished the not payment of Tithes by their temporal
Constitutions. Lambard. (...), page 54. Tom. 1. Council. Britan. page 392.

King Athelstan about the year of our Lord 924. not only decreed them to be
paid, by himself, his Bishops, Aldermen, and Officers, but maintains that his
Law by the example of Jacob, saying, Decimas meas, and hostiam pacificam
offeram tibi; and by other effectual Authorities: providing precisely, that
his own Tithes should diligently be paid, and appointing a time certain for
doing thereof, viz. the feast of the decollation of S. John Baptist. (...), pa.
57. Tom. 1. Council. p. 402.

King Edmund about the year 940. in a solemn Parliament, as well of the Laity,
as Spiritualty, ordained that every man upon pain of his christendom, and
being accursed, should pay them truly. (...), page 73. Tom. 1. Council. page 420.

King Edgar in a great Parliament about the year 959. confirmed the payment of
Tithes, assigning certain times when every thing should be paid, viz. the Tithe
of all young things before Whitsontide, of the fruits of the earth by the
harvest aequinoctiall, ( i. about the 12. September.) and of seed by Martimas;
and this to be done under the pain mentioned in the Book of the Laws of the
Land: whereby it appears that the Laws of the Land had anciently provided for
the payment hereof (though the Book remains not to us at this day) as well as
the Laws of the Church. And he further enacted, that the Sheriff as well as
the Bishop and Priest, should compel every man to pay their Tithes, and should
set it forth, and deliver it, if they would not, leaving to the party offending
only the 9th part: and that the other eight parts should be divided, four to
the Lord, and four to the Bishop; and that no man should herein be spared, were
he the Kings Officer, or any Gentleman whatsoever. (...), page 77.

Tom. 1. Council. pa. 444.

King Canutus, about the year 1016. made the like Law, with some little
enlargement, as appears in his Laws, Tom. Con. page 44.
ca. 8. and as Malmesbury testifies, strictly observed all the Laws of the
ancient Kings, de gestis Regum Angl. lib. 2. p. 55. And he wrote also about the
15. year of his reign from beyond the seas a long letter to all the Bishops and
Nobility of England, conjuring them by the faith, that they ought both to
himself, and to God, that they caused these Laws touching Tithes and Rights of
the Church to be duly executed, and the Tithes to be paid as abovesaid. Malmsb.
p. 74.

But King Edward the Confessor, about the year 1042, made all certain; namely,
that Tithe was due unto God, and should be paid, the tenth sheafe, the tenth
foal, the tenth calf, the tenth cheese; where cheese was made, or the tenth
days milk, where there was no cheese made; the tenth lamb, the tenth fleece,
the tenth part of butter, the tenth pigge; and that they that had but a calfe
or two, should pay for every of them a penny. And to this price is the Parson
generally holden at this day, when ten of our pennies are scarcely worth one of
that time. He also ordained, that Tithe should be paid of bees, woods, meadows,
waters, mils, parks, warrens, fishings, coppises, orchards and negotiations:
and out of all things, says the Law, that the Lord gives, For the Sheriff
and Bishops were in those days, the Kings Justices in every County, and all
matters were heard and decided before them. Note.
the tenth is to be rendered unto him that gives the nine parts with the tenth:
and binds the Sheriff, as well as the Bishop, to see this executed. And all
these were granted, says the Book, by the King, Barons, and Commonalty, as
appears in those his Laws, cap. 8. and Hoveden Annal. part. poster. page 602.

Long after the learned Author had written this, he published the first Tome of
our English Councels, wherein not only these Laws mentioned, are recited, but
also many other Laws and Constitutions concerning Tithes, by other Kings and
Parliaments of that age. It would have been an easy matter to have inserted
them at large here, being there set down in order of time successively; but
because I am unwilling to add any thing, or alter in the text of his discourse;
and that the Tome of the Councels is obvious to every man's perusal, I will
only add some brief references to them, as also to M. Seldom, in the eight
chap. of his History, who has recited them all, and some more then are here
mentioned. From both (these learned Lawyers) the studious Reader may be
abundantly satisfied, especially when the second Tome of the Synods shall be
extant, there will be full testimony of our own Laws, to confirm this truth,
for 500. years after the Conquest, as these are for 500. years before it.

When Gregory the great sent Augustine, ( about the year 600. Chr.) assisted
with 40. Preachers, to publish the Gospel to our forefathers in England, it is
testified by the Laws of Edward the Confessor among other things, that he
preached and commanded Tithes to be paid. -- Haec beatus Augustinus praedicavit
and docuit, and haec concessa sunt a Rege, Baronibus, and populo, sed postea
instinctu diaboli multi eam detinuerunt, etc. and all this was confirmed by the
King, and his Barons, and the people.

Tom. 1. Council. Brit. page 619. 8, 9.

Egbert Archbishop of York, brother to Eadbert King of Northumberland,
published Canons about the year 750. ( which did bind all the Northern parts,
and Scotland in those days) wherein he directs all Ministers to instruct
their people, when, and how to pay their Tithes.

Tom. 1. Con. pa. 258. Can. 5, etc.

About the year 786. in the time of Offa, a great King of Mercia, and Helfwood,
King of Northumberland, and the two Archbishops, there was a great Council
held by two Legates from Hadrian the first, wherein Tithes were established;
and it was likewise confirmed in the South part by the King of West-Saxony. And
as M. Seldom says, it is a most observable Law, being made with great
solemnity of both powers of both States. History cap. 8. page 201.

Tom. 1. Con. page 291. Can. 17.

In the year 855. King Ethelwolph by the consent of all his Baronage and
Bishops, granted the perpetual right of Tithes to the Church, throughout his
whole kingdom, and that free from all taxes and exactions used then in the
State; and this statute is very remarkable, and was confirmed by other Kings,
Brorredus, and Edmundus of East Angles.

Tom. 1. Con. page 384.

For the Northern Clergy, there was a Law made to punish the non-payment of
Tithes.

Tom. 1. Con. page 501.

In a great Parliament at Earham, Anno 1009. by all the States assembled under
King Ethelred, Tithes are commanded and confirmed.

Tom. 1. Con. page 510, etc.

Maccabeus, an ancient King of Scotland, confirms Tithes in his Laws. Con.
page 571. Anno 1050.

In the Canons of Aelfric, Tithes are confirmed, Anno 1052. Con. page 572.

These and many other Constitutions and Laws are particularly, and more fully
recited in the first Tome of our Councels, and in Mr Seldens History, cap. 8.
from whence the Reader may please to take satisfaction, for the space of some
500. years before the Conquest.

William the Conqueror in the fourth year of his reign, when he took a view of
all the ancient Laws of the Land, he first confirmed the liberties of the
Church, because that by it (says Hoveden) the King and the kingdom have their
solid foundation ( page 601.) and herein amongst other Laws of King Edward,
these particularly touching Tithes; which Hen. 1. also did Anno 1100. as
appears by Mat. Par. pa. 53.

The like did also Hen. 2. in the 26. year of his reign, as Hoveden witnesses,
pa. 600.

And for a perclose of all that went before, or should follow after, King Hen.
3. in the ninth year of his reign, by that sacred Charter made in the name of
himself, and his heirs for ever, granted all this anew unto God. We have
granted (says he) unto God, and by this our present Charter have confirmed for
us, and for our heirs for evermore, that the Church of England shall be free,
and shall have all her holy rights inviolable. Magna Charta cap. 1. And that
this Charter might be immortal, and like the sanctified things of the Temple,
for ever inviolable, it was not only fortified by the Kings Seal, (the sacred
Anchor of the kingdom) but by his solemn oath, and the oath of his son, and
the Nobility of the kingdom. Yea, the whole kingdom yielded themselves to
stand accursed, if they should at any time after impeach this grant. And
therefore in the 25 Ed. 1. a special Statute was made for confirmation of this
Charter, V. Rastals Abridg. destat. tit. Confirmat. Sententia lata super
chartas.
wherein amongst other things it is ordained, that the Bishops shall
excommunicate the breakers thereof; and the very form of the sentence is there
prescribed, according to which upon the 13. Maii, Anno 1304. Ed. 1.31. Boniface
the Archbishop of Canterbury, and five other Bishops solemnly denounced this
curse in Westminster Hall, the King himself with a great part of the Nobility
being present. Vid. Pupil. oculi. part. 5. cap. 22.
First, against all them that should wittingly and maliciously deprive, or
spoil Churches of their rights.

Secondly, against those that by any art or devise infringed the liberties of
the Church or Kingdom, granted by Magna Charta and de Foresta.

Thirdly, against all those that should make new Statutes against the Articles
of these Charters, or should keep them being made, or bring in, or keep other
customs; and against the writers of those Statutes, Counselors, and
Executioners thereof, that should presume to give judgment according to them.

And lest this should seem a passion of some particular men for the present
time, rather then a perpetual resolution of the whole kingdom in the
succeeding ages, the zeal and care thereof was continually propagated from
posterity to posterity. So that in 42 Ed. 3. cap. 1. it was further enacted,
that if any Statute were made contrary to Magna Charta, it should be void. And
15. times is this Charter confirmed by Parliament in Ed. 3. time; eight times
in Rich. 2. reign; and six times in Hen. 4. Yea, the frontispice of every
Parliament almost is a confirmation of the rights and privileges of the
Church; as having learned of the very Heathen Poet, who had it from the law of
Nature, (...), we begin ever with God. Neither was there any man found, that
ever would, or durst (with Nero) lay hands upon his Mother the Church; for he
that smites his father or mother, shall die the death, Exodus 20.15.

Heu tot sancitas per plurima secula leges
Hauserit una dies! hora una! et persidus error!
My meaning is not to strain these Laws to the maintenance of such
superstitious gifts as were made to the Church against the honor of God, but
to those only that were for maintenance of his Word and Ministry, which if
they were lawfully conferred (as no man I think doubts but they were) then
let us consider how fearful a thing it is to pull them from God, to rend them
from the Church, to violate the dedications of our Fathers, the Oaths of our
Ancestors, the Decrees of so many Parliaments; and finally, to throw our selves
into those horrible curses, that the whole body of the kingdom has contracted
with God (as Nehomiah and the Jews did, Nehem. 10.) should fall upon them if
they transgress herein. For as Levi paid Tithes in the loins of Abraham, Heb.
7. so the lawful vow of the fathers descends upon their children. And as the
posterity of Jonadab the son of Rechab were blessed in keeping it, ( Jer.
35.18.) so doubtless have we just cause to fear the dint of this curse in
breaking this vow.

Say then, that Tithes were not originally due unto God, and that there
belonged no portion of our Lands unto his Ministers, yet are we in the case of
Nehemiah and the Jews, ( Nehem. 10.32.) They made Statutes by themselves to
give every year the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of God.
And our fathers made Laws amongst themselves to give a portion of their Land,
and the tenth part of their substance, that is, these Parsonages for the
service of the house of God. If they were not due before, they are now due: For
when thou vowest a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shall not be slack to be pay
it, Eccles. also 5.3, 4.
for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee, and so it should be sin
unto thee, Deuteronomy. 23.20. Therefore S. Peter reasoning the matter with Ananias,
tells him, That whilst his land remained in his hands, it appertained unto
him; and when it was sold, the money was his own, Act. 5.4. he might have
chosen whether he would give them God or not: but when his heart had vowed, his
hands were tied to perform them; he vowed all, and all was due: not by the
Levitical law, which now was ended, but by the Moral law which lasts for
ever; for Job being an Heathen man, and not a Jew, says also, Thou shall make
thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shall render him thy
vows, Job 22.27.

If the King give a gift of his inheritance to his son, his son shall have it;
if he give it to his servant, his servant shall have it, Ezekiel. 46.16. If the
King then give a gift to his Father, (that is, to God Almighty) shall not God
have it? or the servant to his Master and Maker, shall not he enjoy it? Who
has power to take that from God, which was given unto him according to his
Word? can the Bishops? can the Clergy give this away? no, they are but
Vsufructuarii, they have but the use of it; the thing it self is Gods, for the
words of the grant be, Concedimus Deo, we give it to God, not to the Bishops.
Therefore when Valentinian the Emperor required the Church of Milan, of that
noble Bishop S. Ambrose, O says he, if any thing were required of me that were
mine, as my land, my house, Orat. de basilie, tradend. p. 2.38.
my gold, or my silver, whatsoever were mine, I would willingly offer it, but
(says he) I can take nothing from the Church, nor deliver that to others,
which I my self received but to keep, and not to deliver.

CAP. XXVIII.
Tithe is not merely Leviticall: How it is, and how not; and wherein Judicial.

TIthe is not simply a Leviticall duty, but respectively; not the natural
child of Moses Law, but the adoptive: Consider first the action, and then the
end; the action, in payment of them; the end, in the employment or disposing of
them: The action of payment of them cannot be said to be properly Leviticall
for diverse reasons.

First, it is much more ancient then the Leviticall Law, as is already
declared, and cannot therefore be said to begin by it, or to be merely
Leviticall.

Secondly, the manner of establishing of it in the Leviticall Law, seems
rather to be an annexion of a thing formerly in use, then the creating or
erecting of a new custom; for in all the Leviticall Law, there is no original
commandment to pay Tithe, but in the place where first it is mentioned, Lev.
27.30. it is positively declared to be the Lords, without any commandment
precedent to yield it to him. Some happily will affirm the commandment in the
22. Exodus that thou shall not keep back thy Tithe, does belong to the
Leviticall Law, though it were given before the Levites were ascribed to the
Tabernacle. Yet (if it were so) that is no fundamental Law whereupon to ground
the first erection of paying Tithe, but rather as a Law of revive, and
confirmation, as of a thing formerly in esse: for detaining and keeping back
do apparently imply a former right, and therefore Tithe was still the Lords,
ex antiquiore jure, and not ex novitio praecepto, by a precedent right, and not
by a new commandment.

Thirdly, it contains no matter of ceremony; for if it did, then must it be a
type and figure of some future thing, and by the passion of our Savior Christ
be converted from a carnal rite into some spiritual observation, (for so
says Jerome of the legal ceremonies) but no such thing appears in it, and
therefore it cannot be said to be a ceremony. The whole body of the Fathers do
confirm this, who in all their works do confidently affirm the doctrine that
S. Paul so much beats upon, that all legal ceremonies be abolished; and yet
as many of them as speak of Tithes, do without all controversy both conclude
and teach, that still they ought to be paid, and therefore plainly not to be a
ceremony.

Fourthly, the Tithing now used, is not after the manner of the Leviticall Law;
for by the Leviticall Law nothing was tithed, but such things as renewed and
increased out of the profits of the earth; but our manner of tithing is after
that of Abraham's, Heb. 7.2.
who gave tithe of all. And this is a thing well to be confidered, for therein
as Abraham tithed to Melchisedek not being of the Tribe of Levi: so our Tithing
is now to Christ being of Melchisedeks order, and not of the Tribe of Levi, but
of that of Juda, whereunto the Tribe of Levi is also to pay their Tithe.

Fifthly and lastly, the end whereunto Tithe was ordained is plainly Moral,
and that in three main points: Piety, Justice, and Gratitude. 1. Piety, as for
the worship of God. 2. Justice, as for the wages and remuneration of his
Ministers. 3. Gratitude, And to encourage them in the service of God. 2 Chronicles.
31.4.
as sacrificium laudis, an offering of thankfulness for his benefits received.
All which were apparent in the use of Tithes before they were assigned over to
the Levites, both in the examples of Abraham and Jacob, and by the practice of
all Nations. For God was to be worshipped before, in, and after the Law, and
though the Law had never been given; but his worship could not be without
Ministers, nor his Ministers without maintenance; and therefore the maintenance
of his Ministers was the maintenance of his worship; and consequently the
tithes applied to the one extended to both. God himself does so expound it,
Mal. 3.8. where he terms the not-payment of Tithes to be his spoil: and
wherein his spoil, but in his worship? and how in his worship, but by taking
from him, the service of his Ministers, the Priests and Levites, who being
deprived thereof could neither perform his holy rites in matter of charge, nor
give their attendance for want of maintenance?

So that herein the children of Israel were not only guilty of that great
sin committed against piety, in hindering the worship of God; but of the
crying sin also committed against equity, in withholding the wages of the
labourer, (his Ministers) and consequently of that monstrous and foul sin of
Ingratitude, which Jacob in vowing of his Tithes so carefully avoided.

To come to the other point before spoken of, the disposing or employment of
the Tithes after they were paid, (that is, when they were out of the power of
them that paid them, and at the ordering of the Levites that received them) it
cannot be denied; but therein were many ceremonies, as namely, in the
sanctifying of them, in the eating them in the Tabernacle, the eating of them
by the Levites only and their family; and as they were otherwise applied to
the ceremonial habit of Gods service for that time: but yet notwithstanding,
even then they still served in the main point to the Moral end of their
original Institution; that is, the worship of God in genere; the maintenance
of his Ministers in genere; and for a token of thankfulness in genere. Against
which the particular applying them to the particular form of worship, and
ceremonies of the Leviticall Law, (for that time abolished) had no repugnancy.
And therefore though that manner of disposing them were Ceremonial, and did
vanish away with the ceremonies themselves: yet did it nothing diminish the
Moral use, and validity of the Institution in genere; which notwithstanding
still remained to be accepted and imitated by all posterity; and yet to be
altered and changed accidentally in the particular ordering and disposing of
them, as the present estate of Gods worship, and the necessity of the time
should require, viz. before the Law, at the pleasure of them before the Law:
under the Law, by the rules of the Law: and now in the time of the Gospel, as
the Church of God either has, or shall appoint them: keeping always (as I say)
the Moral considerations of their Institution, for they may not be diverted
from the Minister, though the course of Gods service be altered from that of
the Levites, but both they and the Levites are laborers in the Lords Vineyard;
and therefore what kind of work soever, either the one, or the other, be for
the time there employed upon, the wages appointed ( Denarius in diem, Mat.
20.2.) is due unto each of them.

Therefore to take away the antithesis, or opposition that some make between
the Ministers of the Gospel, and the Levites and Priests of the Law; God
himself in the last of Esaias, v. 21. Esaias 66, 20.
calls the Ministers of the Gospel Priests and Levites, as though he had
only changed the course of their service, and not the main, or end of their
Institution. I will take of them ( viz. of the Gentiles) for Priests and
Levites, that is, the generation of Levi shall no longer be appropriate to my
service, but I will communicate their function to the Gentiles, and out of them
will I take Priests and Levites to perform the service of my charge.

God therefore brought no new thing into the Leviticall Law, neither changed he
the nature of the former Institution thereof, nor the course of the payment,
nor the quantity of the portion assigned, nor the end whereto it was; but
looking generally into the equity of them all, and approving them all in the
general, (yea, though they were used by the Heathen) he descended into further
particularities for order and government, whereof he prescribed diverse rules,
and observances, some Moral, some Judicial, and some Ceremonial, according
to the fashion of his Church at that time; which like old garments being wholly
worn out with the old Law, the body whereupon they were put, remains still in
the first shape and vigor. And whereas before the Law it seems to be
somewhat at random and uncertain, God by his own mouth in the Books of Moses,
has established, and confirmed. So that these things considered, it cannot be
said to be Leviticall in substance, but respectively only, and by way of
accident.

1. An Objection touching sacrifice, and first fruits, and circumcision.
It may be objected, that sacrifice and first fruits were also in use under the
law of Nature, and from thence, (as Tithe was) translated into the Leviticall
Law: yet they ceased with the Leviticall Law, and why should not Tithe cease
likewise?

Though sacrifice and first fruits were in use under the law of Nature, and
from thence (as Tithe was) translated unto the Leviticall Law, yet the mark
they shot at, and the end whereto they were employed, being once accomplished,
there was in reason no further use of them; for they were like the cloudy and
fiery pillars, that directed the children of Israel to the land of promise, who
being arrived there, needed those helps no longer, and so they vanished away,
as then not necessary. But Tithe in it self and before the Institution of the
Leviticall Law, was only an act of justice and piety; and therefore though the
Leviticall Law, employed it partly unto ceremonies, yet the nature thereof was
not thereby changed, and therefore it still lived, when the Leviticall Law
died. Touching the whole frame of Leviticall ceremonies, it is like that of
Daniels image: the body is decayed and gone, but the legs being partly iron, as
well as clay, by which it was supported; though the clay, that is, the ceremony
be abolished, yet the iron, that is, the Moral Institution thereof, endures
for ever.

The rites of the Leviticall Law were of two sorts; some the natural children
thereof, others the adoptive. I call them natural, that sprang out of the
bowels of it, as those touching the Ark, and Institution of the Levites.
Adoptive, those that being in use before were afterward annexed to it: And of
these I observe two sorts, one arising from some positive Constitutions, as
that of Circumcision; (whereof I will speak anon) and the other deduced from
the law of Nature, as those concerning the worship of God: whereof some were
general and necessarily incident to every form of his worship in all ages; as
Ministers to perform his service, which they called Priests, and means to
maintain it, which they ordained to be by Tithes. The other appropriate to the
natural condition of those times; as sacrifice, and first fruits, which though
they rose out of the law of Nature, as touching the common end of being offered
by way of thanksgiving unto God; yet in that they were also types and figures,
full of ceremony, they became temporal, and thereby transitory. For the
children of Adam finding themselves in the wrath of God; and their flesh,
blood, body, and life, to be altogether corrupted and accursed by the
transgression of their father; they sought by all invention possible to help it
as far as nature could; and therefore both to express the present estate of
their miserable condition, and the mark also they aimed at for redemption in
time to come, they held it as a necessary correspondency, that flesh should be
redeemed with flesh, blood with blood, life with life, the guilty body with a
guiltless body, and to be short, the trespass and corruption of man, by the
innocence of some sanctified creature offered unto God for remission of sin.
And because nothing under the sun could be offered up, but it also was full of
corruption, and that nothing could be acceptable unto God, that was impure,
therefore though they chose the cleanest and perfectest beasts, and things for
these offerings and sacrifices, and purged and sanctified them by all manner of
means they could, yet they devised further to sever the purer and aeriall part
thereof from the gross and earthly; consuming the one, that is to say, the
flesh and the bones (as the body of sin and corruption) with the deserved
torment of fire, and sending the other, that is, the fume and vapor, as the
purer part to carry their prayers and invocations up into heaven, before the
Throne of God. First, how corruptible they were, that is, even like the great
body of a bullock suddenly consumed. Secondly, the punishment in justice due
unto them, even the torment of fire. Thirdly, the place and person from whence
they hoped for redemption: Heaven and Almighty God. And lastly, the means
whereby they were to attain it, taken from two of the proprieties of fire,
light and heat: that is, first, the light of faith, whereby they long foresaw
the promised seed; and secondly, the heat of zeal and hearty prayer, breathed
and sent forth from the altar of a fervent heart, whereby they hoped to obtain
remission of their sins.

After all this they yet considering further, that the corruption and wrath
fallen upon them was perpetual, and that these oblations and sacrifices were
but temporal and momentary, they thought in reason (being only under the law
of Reason) that the one could not countervail the other, and that therefore it
was necessary by continual reiteration and multiplying of sacrifices to
solicit and importune God from day to day until the time came, that a
perpetual sacrifice might be offered up to make sinalem concordiam, in the
high Court of heaven, a full atonement between God and man: which being once
accomplished by our Savior Christ, both the institution and the end of
sacrificing were wholly accomplished, and so no cause for ever after to use
that ceremony any more. For with one offering, says the Apostle to the
Hebrews, has he consecrated for ever them that are sanctified, Heb. 10.14.

Touching Circumcision, though it were before the Leviticall Law, yet it rise
not out of the Law of Nature, or Moral Law, but was instituted by a positive
constitution, made by God himself, and not as a part of his worship, but as a
seal of his Covenant with Abraham, which by this ceremony of cutting away the
impurer part of the flesh, did put the children of Israel ever in mind to cast
away carnal affections, and to hope for the promised Messiah, that should
cleanse them from the impurity of sin, and restore them again to the favor of
God: which being performed by our Savior, the Covenant was fulfilled, and the
seal of Circumcision presently thereby defaced.

2. Of the Sabbath day: Easter and Pentecost.
The Institution of the Sabbath day had in it much more Levitical ceremony,
then the matter of tithing; for no man ought to kindle a fire on that day, nor
dress the meat he should eat, Exodus 35.3.16.24. Jer. 17.11.
nor carry any burden, take a journey, or stir out of the place he was in.
Tarry every man in his place, let no man go out of his place the seventh day,
Exodus 16.29. It was besides a day appointed for diverse particular ceremonies,
sacrifices, and offerings, as ye may read, Number. 28.9, 10. and amongst other
significations, to be a memorial of the great deliverance out of Egypt, (a
thing peculiar to the Jews.) Neither have we any commandment, but only a
precedent for the keeping of it, from the Apostles, Acts 20.9. 1 Cor. 16.2.
Rev. 1.10. Yet durst never any man say, that the Sabbath was therefore to be
abolished, but the temporal and ceremonial parts thereof being taken away,
the moral use of the commandment, which is, that the seventh part of our time
must be dedicate to the general service of God, remains for ever to the
worlds end; for otherwise our Sabbath is so remote from the Sabbath commanded
in the Decalogue, that the one holds almost no affinity with the other, as
appears in the points aforesaid; and for that their Sabbath was the last day
of the week, ours is the first: theirs was in celebration of the end of his
works, ours in celebration of the beginning thereof; for in the first day were
the Elements, the Angels, etc. made. August. Tom. 10. fol. 250. Theirs in
memory of the Creation of the world, ours of the Redemption, that Christ rise
from the dead the first day of the week. And though the Apostles taught us by
example to exchange the Jewish Sabbath for this of ours, as touching the
public meeting on the first day of the week, for setting forth the glory of
God, yet they gave us no commandment to abstain from work on that day; but the
Church decreed, says S. Augustine, that all the honor of the Jewish Sabbath
should be transferred to the Christian; (loco dicto) and is done upon the
Moral reason of the commandment, not the Leviticall.

So likewise in tithing, cut off those parts that were temporal, and
ceremonial, which as I have showed were neither in the payment, nor in the
receiving of them, but in the manner of sanctifying and employment of part of
them, after the Levites were possessed of them: and then that which remains,
namely, the payment and receiving of them for maintenance of the service of God
remains for ever, as a part of the Moral Law, and common equity.

So touching Easter, Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us, 1 Cor. 5.7.
and thereby the end of Institution accomplished: how come we then to continue
it, especially, having neither commandment, nor precedent thereof from the
Apostles? The Ceremonial part of the Paschall feast, viz. the Leviticall Lamb,
the Purification precedent, etc. are abolished with the Law, yet in that Christ
came in the room of that Leviticall Lamb, and was sacrificed at the same time,
and gave his body to be broken and eaten by all, as the Paschall Lamb was for a
satisfaction for our sins, as S. John Baptist says, Ecce Agnus Dei --
therefore is that Feast continued, as it was formerly used, without changing
either the number of the days, or season of the year, or the solemn estimation
that was anciently had thereof: yet note that Easter is kept according to the
Leviticall manner for the time, after the full Moon, and is therefore moveable;
whereas the day that Christ suffered is otherwise fixed, as that of the
Nativity.

So likewise Pentecost, being the 50. day from the first Passover, eaten by
the children of Israel, and the day also whereon the Law was given in Mount
Sinai, and therefore hallowed as one of the three greatest feasts; the Law then
being ended, the celebration of the birthday thereof, must in all reason also
be ended; yet because the fullness of grace, (that holds always an Antithesis
with the Law) that is, the holy Ghost in shape of cloven tongues was at the end
of 50. days after Christ's first Passover sent down upon the Apostles;
therefore is that Feast also continued, at the same time and number of days,
that the Jews used it: although in all the New Testament we have neither
commandment, nor example for keeping either of these Feasts; for though it be
said, Acts 2.1. that when Pentecost was come, the Apostles were all together in
one place, yet was not that their meeting to celebrate the Judaical Feast: but
because the people from all parts then flocked to Jerusalem, the Apostles were
there also, for the better publishing of the Gospel, and for the same reason
was the holy Ghost also in this miraculous manner sent at this time, that by
this means the same thereof might be carried throughout all the world. For it
cannot be intended, that the Apostles met to celebrate the Christians feast,
insomuch as at the beginning of this their meeting the holy Ghost was not sent
upon them. Yet all this while, nor in the Apostles time, as far as the New
Testament discovers, was Easter used, nor the Feast of Pentecost; for though
it be said, that when the Feast of Pentecost was come, they were all with one
accord in one place, Act. 2.1. that is, Nemo non sanctificatus faciat Phase.
Nu. 9.6. hac ceremonia sublata, manet fesium.
at the time when the cloven tongues fell upon them, this like the Sabbath was
the Jews Pentecost, not the Christians; for it answered to the Easter that the
Jews had then last holden, not to that our Savior kept, being the day before
the Jews. So that neither of these Feasts seem to be begun in the Apostles
time, but rather by their next successors; yet Saint Paul, 1 Cor. 16.8. says,
I will tarry at Ephesus till Pentecost, for a great door and effectual is
opened unto me, and there are many adversaries: as though he desired at that
great Feast, to take the opportunity to publish the Gospel, and confute his
adversaries.

CAP. XXIX.
How Appropriations began.

MAny things are notoriously wicked in conclusion, whose beginnings are not
suspected: so has it happened in Appropriations. The Livings that belong to
them, were first given for the maintenance of the Church and her family, that
is, Ministers and poor people. In the Primitive Church the Bishops disposed
them accordingly, but the burden growing in time too great for them, the
Parsons were themselves trusted to do it every one in his own Parish. Then
diverse religious men, as Abbots, Priors, single Deans and Prebends, that had
advowsons to them and their successors, perceiving this, began first to collate
themselves to those Churches, and for lucres sake were contented in their own
persons to do the divine service thereof; and finding sweetness in it, as
enjoying thereby the whole fruits of the Benefice. Every successor did the
like, and by that means kept the Living perpetually in their own hands,
without any favor, or thanks of, or to the Ordinary; at length to avoid the
multiplicity of Institutions and Inductions, they easily obtained license of
the King and Ordinary (sometimes of the Pope himself) that without these usual
ceremonies, they and their successors might be perpetual Incumbents, and take
the profits of those their Benefices. In old time whilst these Churches were
in the Clergy-hand, they were called Appropriations, because they were
appropriate to a particular succession of Churchmen; now they are called
Impropriations, for they are improperly in the hands of Laymen.

But thus Churches became first appropriate, yet only unto such as were merely
spiritual, and might in their own person minister the sacraments and divine
service. But shortly after Deans and Chapters obtained like licenses to them
and their successors, who being a Body corporate, consisting of a multitude,
could not jointly perform this function, and in particular none of them was
tied unto it. Then was it devised, that by their common seal (which is the
tongue of their Corporation) they might appoint a Deputy or Vicar to do it for
them; which invention gave the wound unto the Church, whereof she bleedeth at
this day.

By these examples, Abbots, Priors, single Deans and Prebends, that before
served God in their own persons, learned also to do it now by Vicars and
Substitutes, and so like faithless shepherds left their flocks to careless
pages, themselves minding nothing but the benefit of the Livings. And this
device being once a foot, the very Nuns and Prioresses (that could by no means
administer these holy rites) laid hold thereof, and being religious persons
obtained also the same Licenses: all of them pretending that with great
fidelity they would see that performed effectually to the Church and poor, that
those Livings were at first ordained unto, Divine service, and Hospitality. By
this window crept the Vicars into Churches, who for the most part were some of
the Monastery, whereunto the appropriation belonged; till the statute of 4 H.
4. cap. 12. provided, That in every Church so appropriate, a secular person be
ordained Vicar perpetual, Canonically institute and induct in the same, and
convenably endowed by the discretion of the Ordinary, (1) to do divine
service, (2) and to inform the people, (3) and to keep hospitality there -- and
that no Religious be in any wise made Vicars, in any Church so appropriate, etc.

Thus came Vicars to get a lock out of the Parsons fleece, which though it were
a very poor one, yet was it in some sort proportionable to the deserts and
quality of such heardmen, insomuch as then they were single men, as well as
simple Clerks; but yet notwithstanding they were thus endued before this
Statute, for in the Synod holden at (...) for the Province of Canterbury, Anno
1222. ca. 18. it was ordained, that less should not be assigned to a
perpetual Vicar then five marks a year in rent, which in the proportion that
the rents of that time hold to this, cannot be less then 30l or 40l a year.

So that the Appropriation of a Parsonage was no more at the first, but a grant
made by the Pope, etc. to an Abbot, Prior, Prebend, or some other spiritual
person, being a Body politic and successive, that he and his successors might
for ever be Parsons of that Church, that is, that as one of them died, his
successors might enter into the Rectory, and take the fruits and profits
thereof, without further trouble of admission, Plowd. 500.
institution, or induction; which upon the matter, was no more but to do that
briefly at one cut, that otherwise might and would in length of time be done at
several times, as to admit, institute, and induct the whole succession of a
religious body politic at once, whereas otherwise every successor must have
had a particular institution and induction; and therefore every such successor
during his time, was as perfect an Incumbent, as if he had been particularly
instituted and inducted: but when the succession failed, then it was again
presentative as upon the death of an ordinary Incumbent: and by extinction of
the House, dissolution, cession, or surrender of the House and Order, the
appropriation is determined, and they are now again presentative: Dier Plowd.
497.
for the appropriation is but as a stop in a run, Manwood 501
which being taken away, the former right renueth.

What alteration then did the Statute make of them? did it make them lay, or
temporal Livings? no, the words of the Statute are, That the King shall have
them in as large and ample manner, as the Governors of those houses had them,
etc. So that though the Statute changed the owner of the thing, yet it changed
not the nature of the thing. The Monastical persons had them before as
spiritual Livings, and now the King must have them in as large manner, but
still as spiritual Livings: and with much more reason might the King so have
them, then any other temporal men; for as the Kingdom and Priesthood were
united in the person of our Savior Christ, so the person of a King is not
excluded from the function of a Priest, though as Christ being a Priest, meddled
not with the kingdom, so they as Kings, meddle not with the Priesthood. Yet by
the Laws of the Land the King is composed as well of a spiritual body
politic as of a temporal, and by this his spiritual body he is said to be
supreme Ordinary, that is, chief Bishop over all the Bishops in England, and in
that his Ecclesiastical or Spiritual authority, does many things, which
otherwise in his temporal he could not do; and therefore the Statute of 25 H.
8. cap. does agnise the words, In this part of his power W made Appropriations
of Parsonages, which otherwise he could not do. Coke p. 5. f. 10
authoritate nostra regia Suprema and Ecclesiastica qua fungimur, which the
King uses in diverse Charters touching spiritual causes, do testify, that he
takes upon him the execution thereof: and therefore in this respect he may
much better hold them then his lay subjects. Neither is this authority of the
King founded upon the Statute of H. 8. or any other puisne institution, but
deduced anciently from the very Saxon Kings, as appears by many of their
Laws, and Charters, wherein as supreme Ordinary they dispose of the rights, and
jurisdiction of the Church, delivering unto religious persons, greater or
lesser portion thereof, according to their own pleasure, and abridging and
exempting other from the authority of the Bishops, and Archbishops, or any
other Ecclesiastical Prelate. And in this respect it seems that the Chapel
of the Kings house was in ancient time under no other Ordinary, then the King
himself; for William the Conqueror granting all exemption to Battle Abbey,
grants that it shall be as free from the command of any Bishops, as his own
Chapel. Dominica Capella, which as it thereby seems was under no other
Bishop then the King himself.

But the Bishops agreed to the granting away of these Church Livings.

It is true, that the Law accounts the judgment of the major part, to be the
judgment of all: but the Bishops cannot be said to have agreed unto it, as
being willing with it, but as concluded by legal necessity and inference. For
though all the Bishops said nay, yet the Lay Barons by reason of their number
exceeding the Bishops were not able to hinder it: and no man doubts, that in
public suffrages, very many times, major pars vincit meliorem; therefore I
neither accuse, nor condemn the reverend Bishops herein: for their voices,
though they had given them every one against the Bill, were not able to hinder
it. Neither do I think but that they being men of another profession,
unexercised in the elenchs of the Law, were overtaken in the frame of words,
and thereby passed that away in a cloud, which if they had perceived could
never have been won from them with iron hooks. But in this matter, there being
a question of Religion; Whether Tithes be due jure divino, or whether they
could be separated from the Church; it was not properly a question decidable by
the Parliament, being composed wholly of Lay persons, except some twenty
Bishops, but the question should first have been moved amongst the Bishops by
themselves, and the Clergy in the Convocation house, and then being there
agreed of according to the Word of God, brought into the Parliament. For as the
Temporal Lords exclude the Bishops when it comes to the decision of a matter
of blood, life and member: so by the like reason, the Bishops ought to exclude
the Temporal Lords, when it comes to the decision of a question in Theology;
for God has committed the Tabernacle to Levi, as well as the kingdom to Juda:
and though Juda have power over Levi, as touching the outward government, even
of the Temple it self; yet Juda meddled not with the Oracle, and the holy
Ministry, but received the will of God from the mouth of the Priest. Therefore
when Valentinian the Emperor required Ambrose to come and dispute a point of
Arianisme at his Court, he besought the Emperor, that he might do it in the
Consistory amongst the Bishops, and that the Emperor would be pleased not to
be present among them, lest his presence should captivate their judgments, or
entangle their liberty.


It appears by that which is before showed, and the circumstances thereof,
that the Appropriating of a Parsonage, or the endowing of a Vicarage out of it,
do not cut the Parsonage from the Church, or make it temporal, but leaves it
still spiritual, as well in the eye of the Common Law, as of the Canon Law;
for if it became temporal by the Appropriation, then were it within the
Statute of Mortmain, and forfaited by that very Act. But it is agreed by the 21
Ed. 3. f. 5. and in Plowd. Com. fo. 499. that it is not Mortmain, and therefore
does continue spiritual; for which cause also the Ordinary, and
Ecclesiastical Officers must have still the same authority over such
appropriate Churches, as they had before those Churches were appropriate.

Therefore in the year 1252. Robert Bishop of Lincoln by commission from
Innocent 4. not only enlarged the endowments that before were made, to diverse
Vicarages, (as he thought good) but endowed others out of those Appropriations
that had no Vicarages endowed to the great coffeehouse of all the
Approprietaries of that time, as appears by Matthew. Paris. And therefore also
the Statute of 15 R. 2. cap. 6. and that of 4 H. 4. cap. 12. that ordained,
that in Licenses of Appropriation in the Chancery it should be contained, That
the Bishop of the Diocese in every Church so appropriated, should provide by
his discretion that the Vicar were convenably endowed, Divine service
performed, and a convenient portion of the fruits thereof yearly distributed to
the poor of the Parish, did but agnise and affirm the spiritual end whereto
these Parsonages were appointed, and the authority the Church had still over
them, notwithstanding such Appropriation, commanding the Bishops to see it
executed. Neither do I yet find, where this power is taken from the Bishops,
for the Statute that gives these appropriate Churches to the King, says not,
that the King shall have them as temporal lands, or discharged of the Bishops
jurisdiction, but that he shall have them as the religious persons had them,
that is, as spiritual Livings, and consequently subject to the jurisdiction of
the Bishops before had over them; and then are they no otherwise in the hands
of the Laity; for testimony whereof they also carry at this day the badges and
livery of their Lords and Masters of the Clergy; for as Joseph was taxed in his
own City, so are they yet ranked amongst other spiritual Livings, and as
members of that body do still pay their Synodals and Proxies to the Bishops
and Archdeacons: and if Tithes be withholden from the Approprietary, he still
sueth for them (as spiritual things) in the Spiritual Court. All which are
(by Gods Providence) left upon them as marks of the Tribe they belong unto,
that when the Jubilee comes (if ever it please God to send it) they may
thereby be distinguished, and brought back again to their own Tribe.


Spiritual things and spiritual men are correlatives, and cannot in reason be
divorced: therefore was no man capable of Appropriations but spiritual persons
before the laws of dissolution, which first violated this holy marriage, and
(like Abimelech, Genesis 20.2.) took the wife from the husband, and made Lay men
which before were the children of the Church now become spiritual Fathers. The
act of Appropriation is nothing but to make a body corporate or politic
spiritual, that has succession, perpetual Incumbents in a Rectory; or no
more, upon the matter, then to entail the incumbency to one certain succession
of spiritual men. Therefore as a Patron (says my Lord Dyer, Chief Justice,
and Plowden 496.) must present a spiritual person to a Church, and not a
temporal: so by the same reason, an Appropriation must be made unto a
spiritual person, and not temporal; for says he, the one has cure of souls,
as well as the other: and they differ in nothing but in this, the one is Parson
for his life, and the other and his successors, Parsons shall be for ever: and
for this in the beginning (says he) were the Appropriations made to Abbots,
Priors, Deans, Prebends and such like, as might (in their own person) minister
the Sacraments, and Sacramentals, and to none other. And for the same reason at
the first it was holden, that they could not grant their estates to any other,
no more then the Incumbent of a Parsonage presentative, who though he may lease
his Glebe, and Tithes, yet can he not grant his Incumbency to any other, but
must resign it; and then the Patron and Bishop must make the new Incumbent. And
so the Incumbency which is a spiritual office cannot be granted, nor by the
same reason could the perpetual Incumbent (which is the Approprietary) at the
first grant his estate which contained the Incumbency, and the Rectory, which
is the revenue of the Incumbent.

Therefore when the Order of the Templars (to whom diverse appropriate
Parsonages were belonging) was dissolved, and their possessions granted to the
Prior of S. John of Jerusalem in England, Justice Herle in 3 Ed. 3. said, that
if the Templars had granted their estate in the Appropriations to the
Hospitalers, that is, to them of S. John's of Jerusalem, the Hospitalers should
not have it; for it was granted only to the Templars, and they could not make
an Appropriation thereof over unto others. Therefore to make good the estate of
the Prior and Hospitalers, it was showed there that by the grant of the Pope,
King, and Parliament, the Prior had the estate of the Templars: And so by
Herle, an Appropriation cannot be transferred to another; and with good reason,
(says the book) for it has in it a perpetual Incumbency, which is a
spiritual function appropriate to a certain person spiritual, and cannot be
removed from them in whom it was first settled by any act of theirs.

Herle there also said that, That which was appropropriate unto the Templars,
was disappropriate by the dissolution of their Order, fo. 497. B. So that as
death is the dissolution of every ordinary Incumbent, so the dissolution of a
religious Order, Monastery, or Corporation, is the death thereof, and by that
death (according to this opinion of Justice Herle) the Church appropriate that
belonged thereunto is again become presentable as it was before the
Appropriation; whereunto my Lord Dyer and Manwood do also agree; Dier Plowd.
497. Manwood, ib. 501. l. 2.
and therefore by the dissolution of religious houses, all Appropriations had
been presentable like other Churches, if the Statute of dissolution had not
given them to the King; and by as good reason, might the same Lawmakers have
given him the other also, for any thing that I perceive to the contrary. Yet
let us see in what manner they are given unto the King, for though I cannot
examine the matter according unto the rules of Law, being not so happy (which I
lament) as to attain that profession; yet under correction, I will be so bold
as to offer some points thereof to further consideration; as, first, what is
granted to the King; secondly, the manner how it is granted; thirdly, the ends
why: And herein I humbly beseech my Masters of the Law to censure me
favorably: for I take it by protestation, that I do it not as, asserendo
docere, sed disserendo quaerere legitima illa vera, that Littleton speaks of.


1. The Statute says, That the King shall have all such Monasteries, Priories,
and other such religious Houses of Monks, etc. as were not above 200l a year.
And the Sites, and Circuits thereof, and all Manours, Granges, Meases, Lands,
etc. Tithes, Pensions, Churches, Chapels, Advowsons, Patronages, Annuities,
Rights, Conditions, and other Hereditaments appertaining or belonging to every
such Monastery -- 2. In as large and ample manner, as the Governors of those,
and such other religious Houses have, or ought to have the same in the right of
their Houses. 3. To have and to hold, etc. to his Majesty, his Heirs, and
Assigns, to do and use therewith, his and their own wills, to the pleasure of
God, and to the honor and profit of this Realm.

The words have diverse significations, and therefore make the sense the more
obscure.

Monasteries, Priories, and religious Houses are, 1. Sometimes taken
personally, for the Heads and Members of the House, that is, for the men of the
House, as Church for the Congregation, City for Citizens. 2. Sometime they are
taken locally, for the soil of the House, and in this sense one while
extensively, to all the Territory thereof: another while restrictively, to the
site and building only. 3. They are taken civilly, or locally, for the whole
rights of the House, the lands, the rents, the possessions, and inheritances
whatsoever. In which of these senses the Parliament has given them to the
King, and whether in all of them or not, it is not manifest; but I conceive the
words must be taken in the last sense, which as the more general, includes
also the second; and if the very carcasses of the Monastery persons had been
worth the having, might well enough have fetched them in also. Therefore though
after these general and spacious words, there follows a grant of diverse
particular things, as Sites, Circuits, Granges, Meases, Lands, Tithes, etc. yet
I take this to be but an enumeration of the things in specie, which before are
granted in genere; for if the general words have not carried them, as the body
carries the members, then it seems these particulars do not carry them, for
they are granted but as Appurtenances to the said Monasteries, and Houses, for
the words be, Sites, Circuits, Lands, Tithes, etc. appertaining or belonging to
every such Monastery; words in my understanding only of explanation and
restraint, and not trenching to the enlargement of the grant.


So that upon the matter the Parliament has granted Tithes and Appropriations
to the King, if they belonged unto the Monasteries, and not otherwise. Let us
therefore see whether they belong or not.


Abbots, Priors, and such religious men had two sorts of Tithes; one
incorporate to their Houses, which I call Monastical Tithes: the other
depending upon their function, as they were Parsons of any Parish, which
therefore I call Parish Tithes. 1. The first of these came unto them, as their
very lands did, by plain point of Charter; for before the Lugdune and Lateran
Councels, every man might bestow his Tithes upon what religious House person he
listed: and then the founders and benefactors of religious Houses did
ordinarily grant all or some portion of their Tithes to those Houses, as by a
multitude of precedents thereof of appears. Neol. Fossard dedit an. 1081.
Aldwino Abbati de Ramsey, viz. Deo, etc. Ecclesiam de Bromham and terram ad
duas carrucas and decimas trium villarum, and de duobis molendinis and tota^
decimam de propria aula. Liber MS. Ramsey page 240.
From hence it rise that the Monasteries had so many portions of Tithes, or
rents for them (which we call Pensions) out of so many several and remote
places of the kingdom; and therefore all these Tithes (how unjustly soever
they were conferred upon them) were de corpore Monasterii, and passed
undoubtedly to the King. 2. But the other sort, that is, Parish Tithes,
belonged only to the Parson of the Parish, by reason of his function, and
incumbency; which function, though by act of Appropriation, it were collated
upon these religious men, yet did it not invest the property of those Tithes in
their Monasteries, but made their persons capable of them by reason of that
their function, for without their function of being Ecclesiastical persons,
they could not have them, being forain unto them, as I may term it, and not
domestical, as belonging to their house, or monastical, as belonging to their
conventuall body.


Though the Parliament has power to dispose temporal inheritance, and to make
Laws to bind the rights of subjects, yet it is confessed by the Books of the
Law themselves, that it can establish nothing against the law of God; and
therefore if Tithes be in the Clergy by the Law of God, as before we have
showed, then can they not be pulled from him by any law of man. Neither has
the Parliament as it seems attempted to do it, but insomuch as they were
misemployed by the Clergy of that time, therefore the Parliament took them from
them, and gave them to the King, not in any new course of property, or to be
enjoyed by him as his temporal inheritance: but to be his in as large and
ample manner (says the Statute) as the Governors of those religious Houses --
had or ought to have the same. Now it is apparent, that the Governors of
religious Houses, neither had them, nor ought to have them, otherwise then to
the service of God, and benefit of the Church.


This point depends upon the precedent, for the end why they were given unto
the King, is declared by the manner of giving them unto him. Therefore though
the Statute says, To have and to hold -- to his Majesty, his heirs, and their
own wills, to do and use therewith, his and their own wills; yet lest their wills
should decline from the due employment of them (as the religious persons did)
therefore the Statute adds these words, to the pleasure of God, and to the
honor and profit of this Realm. So that the King had not the things themselves
simply, but in such manner only as the religious persons had them, and that
being but to the service of God, and benefit of the Church, the King could have
them in no other manner then for the service of God, and benefit of the Church;
and then to the words subsequent in the Habendum, viz. to do and use therewith
their wills, is no more, then if we should say, That the King, etc. should have
them to dispose of in the service of God and of his Church, according to his
own will and wisdom; which the words annexed plainly intimate, appointing unto
the King by what bounds and marks he must walk in disposing of them, namely
so, as may be to the pleasure of God, and the honor and profit of the Realm.
But it cannot be to the pleasure of God, that his Ministers should be
defrauded; nor to the honor and profit of the Realm, that the service of God
should be hindered, or neglected, and therefore the King must have and hold
them to those purposes, and to none other.

And that the King was not deceived in this kind of construction of the Act of
Parliament, it appears by a Declaration made by himself freely in an Oration
of his unto the Parliament, Anno 37. of his reign, where he says, -- I cannot
a little rejoice, when I consider the perfect trust and confidence, which you
have put in me, as men having undoubted hope, and unfeigned belief, in my good
doings and just proceedings; for you without my desire or request, have
committed to my order and disposition all Chauntries, Colleges, Hospitals, and
other places specified in a certain Act, firmly trusting, that I will order
them to the glory of God, and the profit of the Commonwealth. Surely, if I
contrary to your expectation should suffer the Ministers of the Church to
decay, or Learning (which is so great a jewel) to be minished, or poor and
miserable to be unrelieved, you might well say, that I being put in so special
a Trust, as I am in this case, were no trusty friend to you, nor charitable to
my even Christian, neither a lover of the public wealth, nor yet one that
feared God, to whom account must be rendered of all our doings. Doubt not I
pray you, but your expectation shall be served more Godly and Goodly, then you
will wish or desire, as hereafter you shall plainly perceive, etc.

So that the King hereby does not only ingenuously confess the Trust
committed to him by the Parliament, in the same manner that the Act assigns
it, viz. to be for the glory of God, and the profit of the Commonwealth: but
he descends also into the particularities of that Trust, as namely, for the
maintenance of the Ministers, the advancement of Learning, and provision for
the poor.


In the 45. chap. of Ezekiel, God commands the Prophet to divide the Land
into three parts, one for God himself, and his servants the Priests, the other
for the King, and the third for the people. And then he says, Let this
suffice, O ye Princes of Israel, v. 9. Leave off cruelty and oppression, and
execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people. And
again, chap. 46.18. The Prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance, nor
thrust them out of their possessions, but he shall cause his sons to inherit
his own possession, that my people be not scattered every man from his own
possession.

Though the said Texts favor something of the Leviticall Law, as to preserve
the Tribes from confusion, yet they present also unto us rules of Moral
justice. First, that in the division of the Kingdom, we must remember to give
him a part for his honor, that gives us all for our necessities; therefore he
says in another place, (45.1.) When ye shall divide the Land for inheritance,
ye shall offer an oblation unto the Lord, an holy portion of the Land.
Secondly, that the Prince must be contented with the portion assigned him, and
not to disturb the people in their possession, but not God especially in his,
for that is privileged further and defended with another iron bar, it is an
oblation, says the Text, unto the Lord, yea, it is an holy portion of the
land. Holy, because it is offered unto God, and holy again, for that being
offered unto the Lord it is severed from the injury of man, it must not be
violated, nor plucked back, it must not be sold, nor redeemed, it is an
inheritance separate from the common use, it is most holy unto the Lord, Lev.
27.28.

It being thus manifested, what are the chief ends and uses of Parsonages, it
appears how unjust it is to tolerate Appropriations, and how miserable their
condition is who hold them: Oh how lamentable is the case of a poor
Approprietary, that dying, thinks of no other account, but of that touching
his lay vocation, and then coming before the Judgment seat of Almighty God,
must answer also for this spiritual function; first, why he meddled with it,
not being called unto it; then why (meddling with it) he did not the duty that
belongs unto it, in seeing the Church carefully served, the Minister thereof
sufficiently maintained, and the poor of the Parish faithfully relieved. This,
I say, is the use whereto Parsonages were given, and of this use we had notice
before we purchased them; and therefore not only by the Laws of God, and the
Church, but by the Law of the Land, and the rules of the Chancery, at this day
observed, we ought only to hold them to this use, and no other. Look how many
of the Parishioners are cast away for want of teaching, he is guilty of their
blood; at his hand it shall be required, because he has taken upon him the
charge. He says, he is Parson of that place, and of his own mouth will God
judge him, for idle Parsons are guilty of the blood of the Parishioners, and
this S. Paul shows, when he says, I thank God I am pure from the blood of
all men, Act. 20.26. meaning he taught the counsel of God so faithfully, as if
any be not saved thereby, their blood is upon their own heads, for he on his
own part adds, that he has kept nothing back, but showed them all the
counsel of God, v. 27.

It is not therefore a work of bounty and benevolence to restore these
Appropriations to the Churches, but of duty and necessity so to do. It is a
work of duty to give that unto God that is Gods, Mat. 22.21. and a work of
necessity toward the obtaining remission of these sins; for, as S. Augustine
says, Non remittitur peccatum, nisi restituatur ablatum, cum restitui potest.
Augustine. Macedon. Ep. 54. The sin shall not be forgiven without restoring of
that which is taken away, if it may be restored.

that took away Impropriations from the Church.
We must note touching that first Statute, the time wherein it was made, the
persons by whom, the circumstances in the carriage and effecting of it, and the
end why. The time, while it was yet but dawning of the day, or twilight of both
Religions. The persons, then members of the Parliament, half of them I fear, if
not the greater half, either absolute Papists, or infected with Romish
Religion; the other half yet in effect but (...) and candidati restitutae
religionis, and so could not by and by conceive all dependencies in so great a
work, and what was (...) in every respect, to be provided for. The
circumstances, incident to the business, as the great and strong opposition of
the adverse party; which happily was so potent in Parliament, as if opportunity
had not been taken at some advantage for passing of the bill, whilst many of
them were absent, it had not passed so soon: and this might well cause haste in
the carriage of it, and haste imperfection. How it fell out in that point I do
not know, but I have heard that anno 1. Mariae, when the Laws of H. 8. touching
the Praemunire, This Parliament begun 5. October. 1554 and ended 5. December. Fox
p. 1396. Col. 2. l. 1.
and of Ed. 6. touching Religion were repealed, the matter was so handled as
there were but 28. persons in the Parliament House to give their voice with the
Bill, and yet carried it; So in this business the great haste and desire to
effect it, and the great matters aimed at, as the transferring of all
Monasteries Livings unto the King, A Parliament of 28. Bishops, etc. to undo
28. general Councels happily not half 28.
made somethings in the Act to pass unconsidered, and no doubt amongst other
these appropriate Parsonages; which in truth are not named in that Act, but
carried away in the fluent of general words, wherein though Tithes be
inserted, yet the word may seem only to intend such portions of Tithes as
belonged to the Monastery it self, as many did, and not those belonging unto
Appropriations, since the Appropriations themselves are not there named. But I
will excuse the matter no farther then equity; for after Religion had gotten
some strength, the following Act of 31 H. 8. c. 13. gives them expressly to the
King by the words, Parsonages appropried, Vicarages, Churches, etc. yet was all
this done in the heat and agony of zeal then privily enflamed on all parts
against the Romish religion, insomuch as other inconveniences and enormities
likewise followed thereon, as in Ed. 6. the burning of many notable Manuscript
Books, the spoiling and defacing of many goodly Tombs and Monuments in all
parts of the kingdom, pulling down of Bells, Chancels, and in many places of
the very Churches themselves.

Moses for haste broke the Tables of the Law; and these inconveniences in such
notable transmutations cannot be avoided, some corn will go away with the
chafe, and some chafe will remain in the corn; man's wit cannot suddenly, or
easily sever them. Therefore our Savior Christ foreseeing this consequence
delayed the weeding out of the tares from the wheat, till the Harvest was come,
that is, the full time of ripeness and opportunity to do it. Besides, light
and darkness cannot be severed in puncto, the day will have somewhat of the
night, and the night somewhat of the day: the religion professed, brought
something with it of the religion abolished, and the religion abolished has
somewhat still that is wanting in ours; and neither will ever be so severed,
Discipline in genere, according to the Primitive Church, not in specie as they
use it.
but each will hold somewhat of the other: no rent can divide them by a line.
When the children of Israel came out of Egypt, they brought much of the
Egyptian infection with them, as appears in the Scripture, and they left of
their rites and ceremonies among the Egyptians, as appears in Herodotus.
Therefore as Moses renewed the Tables that were broken through haste, and time
reformed the errors of religion amongst the Israelites: So we doubt not but his
Mty, our Moses, will still proceed in repairing these breaches of the Church,
and that time by Gods blessing will mend these evils of ours. I will not take
upon me like Zedechias to foretell, having not the spirit of prophecy, but I am
verily persuaded, that some are already borne that shall see these Appropriate
Parsonages restored to the Church: let not any man think they are his, because
Law has given them him, for Tully himself the greatest Lawyer of his time,
confesses, that, Delegibus.
Stultissimum est existimare omnia justa esse quae sita sint in populorum
institutis aut legibus, Nothing to be more foolish then to think all is just
that is contained in the Laws or Statutes of any Nation. Experience teaches
us, that our own Laws are daily accused of imperfection, often amended,
expounded, and repealed. Look back into times past, and we shall find that many
of them have been unprofitable for the Commonwealth, many dishonorable to the
kingdom, some contrary to the Word of God, and some very impious and
intolerable, yet all propounded, debated, and concluded by Parliament. Neither
is this evil peculiar to our Country; where has it not reigned? Esaias found it
in his time, and proclaims against it, Woe be unto you, that make wicked
Statutes, and write grievous things. ^at. in M. Anton. per servos, per vim, per
latrocini^m.
So Tully and the Roman Historians cry out, that their Laws were often, per
vim, and contra auspicia impositae reipublicae, by force and against all
religion imposed upon the Commonwealth. God be thanked we live not in those
times, yet do our Laws and all Laws still, and will ever in one part or other
taste of the cask, I mean of the frailty of the makers. It is not therefore
amiss (though happily for me) to examine them in this point, if they be
contrary to the Word of God, for I think no man will defend them, they leave
them to be a Law. God cannot be confined, restrained, or concluded by any
Parliament, let no man therefore (as I say) think that he has right to these
Parsonages, because the Law has given them him; the law of man can give him no
more then the law of Nature, and God will permit. The Law has given him jus ad
rem, as to demand it, or defend it, Vi. Na. Br. 14. s. 369. Jus perfectum cum
possideatur in promiss. imperfectum dum non possideatur premiss.
in action against another man, it cannot give him jus in re, as to claim it in
right against God. Canonists, Civilians, and common Lawyers, do all admit this
distinction, and agree, that jus ad rem est jus imperfectum, right to the thing
is a lame Title, they must have right in it, that will have perfect Title. The
Law does as much as it can, it has made him rei usufructuarium, but it cannot
make him rei dominum, the very owner of the thing. The books of the Law
themselves confess, that all Prescriptions, Statutes, and Stud. li. 1. c. 2.
s. 4. a.
and Customs against the law of Nature (or of God) be void and against Justice.


No man by the Common law of the Land can have inheritance of Tithes, unless
he be Ecclesiastical, or have Ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Lord Coke part 5.
Rep. fol. 15. and Plowd. fol. So that he which has Ecclesiastical
jurisdiction, though he be no Ecclesiastical person, yet by the ancient Law of
the Land, he may enjoy Tithes: and this concurreth not only with the Canon
Law, but seems also to be warranted by the example of the Provincial
Levites, who meddled not with the Temple, and yet received their portion of
Tithes, and other Oblations, as well as those that ministered in the Temple. But
it plainly excludes all such as be merely Lay from being capable of them; let
us then see by what better Title the King may hold them.

As the head cannot give life and motion to the diverse members of the body,
unless it hold a correspondency with them in their diverse natures, and
compositions: So the King, the head of the politic body, cannot govern the
diverse members thereof in their several constitutions, unless he participate
with them in their several natures; which because they are part Lay, and part
Ecclesiastical, the jurisdiction therefore whereby he governs them, must of
necessity have a correspondent mixture, and be also partly Lay, and partly
Ecclesiastical; to the end that from these diverse fountains in the person of
his Majesty, those diverse members in the body of the kingdom may according to
their peculiar faculties receive their just and competent government. My
meaning is not, that a Prince cannot in moral matters govern his subjects
professed in religion, unless himself do participate with them in some
portion of their spiritual vocation: Romans 13.1. 2 Pet. 2.13.
for I see that the Apostles themselves were therein subject to the Heathen
Princes, and gave commandment to all Christians in general, Oportet nos ex
(...) part quae ad hanc vitam ^ertinet, subdi^os esse potestatibus, i.
homininibus res humanas cum aliquo honor administrantibus. in li. ex pos.
quarundum propositinum. ex Ep. ad Romans
that they likewise should do the same; and thereupon S. Austin says, that in
those things that concern this life, we must be subject to them that govern
humane things. But my meaning is, that a temporal Prince cannot properly
dispose the matters of the Church, if he have not Ecclesiastical function, and
ability, as well as Temporal; for I doubt not but that the government of the
Church, and of the Commonwealth, are not only distinct members in this his
Majesty's kingdom, but distinct bodies also under their peculiar heads, united
in the person of his Majesty, yet without confusion of their faculties, or
without being subject the one to the other. For the King, as merely a temporal
Magistrate, commands nothing in Ecclesiastical causes, neither as the
supreme Officer of the Church does he interpose in the temporal government:
but like the common arch arising from both these pillars he protecteth and
combineth them in perpetual stability, governing that of the Church by his
Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and that of the Commonwealth by his temporal.
For this cause, as Moses was counted in sacerdotibus, Psalm. 99.6. though he
were the temporal Governor of the people of Israel, so the Laws of the Land
have of old armed the King, persona mixta, medium, or rather commune quiddam
inter laicos and sacerdotes: and have thereupon justly assigned to him a
politic body, composed as well of Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, as temporal,
like to that of David, Jehosaphat, Hezekias, and other Kings of Juda, who not
only in respect of their Crown, led the Armies of the people against their
enemies: but as anointed with the holy oil, ordered and disposed the very
function of the Levites, of the Priests, and of the Temple, as you may read in
their several lives in the books of the Kings and Chronicles.

But the Kings of England have proceeded yet further in the gradations of
Ecclesiastical profession, as thinking it with David, more honorable, to be a
doorkeeper in the House of God, then to dwell in the tents of the ungodly, that
is, to execute the meanest office in the service of God, then those of greatest
renown among the Heathen and Infidels. Therefore they have by ancient custom
even before the Conquest, amongst other the solemnities of their Coronation,
not only been girt with the regal sword of Justice by the Lay Peers of the
Land, as the emblem of their temporal authority, but anointed also by the
Bishops with the oil of Priesthood, as a mark unto us of their Ecclesiastical
profession and jurisdiction. And as they have habenam regni, put upon them, to
express the one, so also have they stolam sacerdotii, commonly called vestem
dalmaticam, as a Leviticall Ephod, to express the other. The reasons of which,
if we shall seek from the ancient Institutions of the Church, it is apparent by
the Epistle of Gregory the great, unto Aregius Bishop of France, Ep. l. 7. c.
111.
that this vestis dalmatica, was of that reverence amongst the Clergy of that
time, that the principal Churchmen, no not the Bishops themselves, might wear
it without license of the Pope. And when this Aregius, a Bishop of France,
requested that he and his Archdeacon might use it, Gregory took a long
advisement upon the matter, as a thing of weight and novelty, before he granted
it unto them. But 22. years before the time of Edward the Confessor, (unto whom
those hallowed vestures happily did belong, with which his Majesty was at this
day consecrated) these dalmaticae, Propter solennitatem Sp. S. Diaconi
dalmaticis induantur. Idem Decr. p. distinct. 76. le Jejunio.
otherwise called albae and stolae, were by the Council Salegunstadiens. cap.
2. made common to all Deacons, and permitted to them to be worn in great
solemnities, which the Kings of England also ever since Edward the Confessors
time, if not before, have always been attired with in their Coronations.

And touching their unction, the very books of the Law do testify to be done,
to the end, to make them capable of spiritual jurisdiction, for it is there
said, that Reges sacro oleo uncti sunt spiritualis jurisdictionis capaces; the
Kings being anointed with the holy oil are now made capable of spiritual
jurisdiction. This ceremony of unction, was not common to all Christian Kings,
for they being about Hen. 2. time, 24. in number, only four of them besides
the Emperor were thus anointed, namely, the Kings of England, France,
Jerusalem, and Sicil.

The first English King as far as I can find, that received this privilege was
Elfred or Alured, the glorious son of noble and devout Ethelwolphus King of
West-Saxony, who about the year of our Lord 860. being sent to Rome, was there
by Leo 4. anointed and crowned King, in the life of his father, Witlasius Rex
Merciorum subditus Ethelwolphi regis West-Sax. Coronat. Ingolf. 856. l. 56.
and happily was the first King of this Land that ever wore a Crown, whatsoever
our Chroniclers report (for of the 24. Kings I speak of, it is affirmed in
ancient books, that only four of them were in those days crowned.) But after
this anointing, Alured (as if the Spirit of God had therewith come upon him, as
it did upon David being anointed by Samuel,) grew so potent and illustrious in
all kinds of virtues, as well divine as moral, that in many ages the world
afforded him no equal: zealous toward God, and his Church, devout in prayer,
profuse in alms, always in honorable action, prudent in government, victorious
in wars, glorious in peace, affecting justice above all things, and with a
strong hand reducing his barbarous subjects to obedience of Law, and to love
equity; the first learned King of our Saxon Nation, the first that planted
literature amongst them; for himself does testify in his Preface to Gregory's
Pastoral, that there were very few on the South Side Humber, but he knew not
one on the South Side of the Thames, that when he began to reign, understood
the Latin Service, or could make an Epistle out of Latin into English, etc.
He fetched learned men from beyond the Seas, and compelled the Nobles of his
Land to set their sons to school, and to apply themselves to learn the Laws and
Customs of their Country, admitting none to places of Justice without some
learning, nor sparing any that abused their places, for unto such himself
looked diligently. He divided the Kingdom into Shires, Hundreds, Wapentakes,
and them again into Tithings and free Bourghs, compelling every person in his
Kingdom to be so settled in some of those free Bourghs, that if he any way
trespassed, his fellows of that free Bourgh answered for him.

The memory of this admirable Prince carries me from my purpose; but to return
to it, his successors have ever since been consecrated, and thereby made
capable of spiritual jurisdiction, and have accordingly used the same in all
ages, and thought by the Pope to be so enabled unto it, that Nicholas 2.
doubted not to commit the government of all the Churches of England unto Edward
the Confessor, as by and by we shall more largely declare. And the Kings of
France being so likewise consecrated ever since the time of Clodoveus, alias,
Ludovicus, whom Saint Remigius Bishop of Rheimes, both baptized and anointed
about the year of our Lord 500. have from time to time, in all ancient ages
exercised the like Ecclesiastical jurisdiction: insomuch that Clodoveus
himself being but newly entered into is, doubted not to appoint a Council at
Orleans, and to call thither the Bishops and Clergy of France, but out of the
motion of Priestly mind, (to use the very words of the Council) commanded the
Priests, (meaning the Bishops) to assemble there for debating necessary
matters, which in his own consideration he had advised upon, and delivered to
them in heads and titles; and they having answered thereunto, and framed the
Canons of that Council, accordingly did submit them to his judgment, and
desiring if it approved them, himself for greater authority would confirm them.
Tom. 2. Council. page 309. in rescripto Synodi.

The Kings of Jerusalem and Sicil, were also anointed and endowed with
Ecclesiastical authority, whereof we shall speak more anon: for the right of
both these Kingdoms resideth at this present upon the Kings of Spain, who till
the same came unto them, were neither anointed, nor crowned; and though since
that time, they have been dignified with both these Prerogatives, yet are they
not so illustrious in them, as in the Kings of England and France, for that
these are ancient Kingdoms, raised by their own power and prowess, and those
other of less continuance, erected by the Pope, and not absolute, but
Feodaries of his Sea. And touching that of France also, the mere right thereof
rests upon his Majesty of England, though de facto, another for the time
possesses it: So that in this point of unction, our Sovereign the King of
England is amongst the rest of the Kings of Christendom, at this day Peerlesse
and transcendent; and well therefore might William Rufus say, that himself had
all the liberties in his Kingdom which the Emperor challenged in his Empire.
Mat. Paris.

But I wonder, why the Papists should so considently deny the Kings of England
to be capable of spiritual jurisdiction, when Pope Nicholas 2. of whom we
spoke before in an Epistle to King Edward the Confessor, has upon the matter
agreed, that it may be so; for amongst other privileges that he there
bestows upon the Church of Saint Peter of Westminster then newly founded by
that virtuous King; He grants, and absolutely confirms, that it shall for
ever be a place of Regal Constitution and Consecration, -- and a perpetual
habitation of Monks that shall be subject to no living creature, but the King
himself, free from Episcopal service and authority, and where no Bishop shall
enter to give any orders, etc. Tom. Council. part 3. pa. 1129. a.

In which words I note, first, that the Kings of England in those ancient days,
being before their Coronation merely Lay persons, were by their consecration
made candidati Ecclesiasticae potestatis, and admitted to the administration
thereof; for to what other purpose was Consecration ordained, but to make
secular things to belong unto the Temple, and Lay persons to become sacred and
Ecclesiastical? like Jacobs stone in the time of the Moral Law, which
presently upon the anointing thereof became appropriate to the House of God.

Secondly, he plainly makes the King head of this Monastery, that is, of the
place it self, and of all the persons and members thereof, which then by
consequence he might likewise be of all other Ecclesiastical persons and
places through the whole Kingdom. And even that also he grants in a sort in
the end of his Epistle, Vobis and posteris vestris regibus committimus
advocationem and tuitionem ejusdem loci, and omnium totius Angliae Ecclesiarum,
ut vice nostra cum concilio Episcoporum and Abbatum, constituatis ubique quae
justa sunt. So that if the Kings of England be pleased to execute this
Ecclesiastical authority as the Popes Vicar, then by this his Charter they are
invested therewith; and peradventure the Clergy of Rome can never revoke it,
being granted posteris regibus: and the Epistles of the Popes, being as
Barclayus says of Nich. 1. to Michael the Emperor, as an Ecclesiastical Law,
Lib. de potest. Papae. ca. 2. page 13.

But in the mean time it is hereby evident, which I endeavor to prove, that
the Kings of England are justly capable of spiritual jurisdiction by the Popes
own confession, for which purpose only I here allege it. And to give more
life to the matter, it appears by Baronius, that Pope Vrbane the granted not
only as much in the Kingdom of Sicil to the King of Spain, being the anointed
King thereof, but added also to that his Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, diverse
branches of spiritual power belonging merely to the keys, and not to the
sword, that is, to the very function of a Bishop, as namely, that of
Excommunication. All which, though Baronius impugneth mainly to be of no
validity, because that all things are void, (he says) that the Church does
against her self: yet the King of Spain both holds, and exercises this
function and jurisdiction only by the connivency of the Pope, but defended
therein by Cardinal Ascanius Colonna, against Baronius.

But to leave forain examples, and to go on with our domestical precedents;
It is manifest by other ancient Authorities, Charters, and Manuscripts, that
the Pope thereby granted no more to King Edward and his successors, then the
same King, and his Predecessors, before assumed to themselves. For this Epistle
could not be written to S. Edward, before the end of his reign, ( Nicholas not
being Pope till then) and in the Laws of the same King, before that time
published, himself does plainly declare himself to be, Vicarius summi Regis,
not summi pontificis: yea, and that in the government of the Church. For the
words of his own Law, (...). cap. 17. be these -- The King because he is the
Vicar of the highest King, is appointed to this purpose, that he should rule
his earthly Kingdom, and the Lords people: and should above all things worship
his holy Church, and govern it, and defend it against them that would wrong it,
and to pull the evil doers out of it, etc. So that write the Pope what he
will, S. Edward here takes upon him to have the rule and government of the
Church of England (committed to him from God, and not from the Pope) and to be
Gods Vicar, not the Popes: wherein he imitated his predecessors; for King Edgar
speaking of the government of the Church, says in plain terms, that it
belonged to himself, ad nos (says he) spectat. And because Casaubon in citing
this place out of the Manuscript, is charged by Parsons to falsify it, and
that it is, or should be on the contrary, ad vos spectat, scil. Ecclesiasticos:
give me leave to defend that worthy man being now dead, in whose behalf I must
avow that the original is plainly ad nos, and not ad vos; which lest it should
seem either mistaken, or questionable, King Edgar himself does manifestly clear
it, both by deeds and words: for of his own authority he removed generally the
Clerks of that time, that were not professed, out of the Monasteries, and
placed in their rooms, Monks and regular persons, as appears by his own
words, in his Charter of Malmesbury. (Malmsb. page 58. l. 17.) And also in the
foundation Book of the Abbey of Winchester, written all in golden letters,
wherein likewise he prescribes the rules for the government of the religious
persons there, and says, that himself will look to the Monks, and that his
wife Aelfthryth shall look to the Nuns. And lest it should seem that he had
done this rather out of the will of a Prince, then by just authority, Hoveden,
and Historia Jornalensis, do testify, that he did it by the advice and means
of Ethelwould, Bishop of Winton, and Oswald, Bishop of Worcester. So that the
very Clergy of that time, agnised, executed, and affirmed his jurisdiction
herein: which I will close up with a material sentence out of his Charter in
Glastenberry, extant in Malmsbury de gest. Reg. li. 2. page 57. where the words
be these, Concessit etiam (scil. Edgarus) ut sicut ipse in propria, ita totius
insulae causas, in omnibus tam Ecclesiasticis quam secularibus negotiis, absque
ulla ullius contradictione Abbas and Conventus corrigeret, that is, King Edgar
granted, that the Abbot and Covent of Glastenberry should correct (or amend)
all causes, as well Ecclesiastical as secular, within the whole Isle of
Glastenberry, as himself did within his own Isle, namely, of England. So that
the King here denounces, that himself has the correction or ordering of all
Ecclesiastical causes within this his Isle. And in further declaration thereof
does by that his Charter by and by after prohibit all Bishops from meddling
within the Isle of Glastenberry: and lest he should seem to do a new thing, he
closes it up with this apology, That his predecessors, Cemwines, Ines,
Ethelardus, Cuthredus, Elfredus, Edwardus, Ethelstanus, Edmundus, had all of
them done the like; and he might have added out of Bid, l. 2. c. 7. that
Cenwalch King of West Saxon, of his own authority divided the Sea of Agilbert
his Bishop, being a French man, and of another language, which he understood
not, and gave one part thereof unto Winus a man of his own Nation, which though
he were afterward compelled by necessity and discontent of Agilbert to
reunite, yet his successor Inas, divided them again, and then they so
continued. Hen. Huntington l. 4. pa. 33. l. 49.

It is true, that ad majorem cautelam, King Edgar required John 12. to confirm
these privileges, lest any, as he says, should in future time, either take
them away, or throw out the Monks, but himself had first done it of himself;
and the vigor that the Pope added to it, was rather a fortifying of it with a
curse against robbers, and spoilers, then an enlargement of the validity
thereof, as quickening thereby a livelesse body. For so likewise may the Popes
own authority be disputable, insomuch as he also required the general Synod,
then holden at Rome, Anno 965. (as Malmsbur. says) to confirm it. But the
fashion of those times was, that secular Princes sought sometimes to have their
temporal Laws confirmed by the Pope with a curse against the breakers thereof,
as did Howell Dhae, for those his Laws of Wales; and in like manner was it
usual for Councels and Synods to seek the confirmation of their Canons from
temporal Princes, as did that of Orleans before spoken of from Clodoveus, and
the Council of Toledo (...) from Euricus, who made a special Law for
establishing it, as you may see in the Laws of the Wisegothes, l. 12. tit. 1.
ca. 3. ut sic gladius gladium adjuvaret.

It may be objected, that Edgar being the great King of this whole Isle, (for
he styled himself totius Albionis basileus) might usurp upon the Church, and
do these things rather in the will of a Prince, then by just authority. It is
manifest partly by that which I said before, but plentifully by his Charters,
that the Clergy of that time were so far from denying, or repining at this his
jurisdiction, that they affirmed and subscribed unto it, as appears in his
Charters. And how large soever his Dominion was, his humility was as great, for
though in matters of government he carried himself as the head Officer of the
Church, yet in matters of faith he was so obedient, that to expiate his
incontinency with a Nun, he threw himself at the feet of Dunstan his Bishop,
submitted himself to seven years penance, and presumed not to be consecrated
till the 14. year of his reign.

But these things were no novelties either in the person of Edgar, or in the
Princes of those ages; for the minor Kings themselves within the orbs of their
own Dominion used the like jurisdiction, as you may perceive by those cited by
Edgar, in the Charter of Glastenberry, and by many other in particular Charters
of their own. Yea, the Kings of Mercia that were but vassals, and underlings to
the Kings of West-Saxony, within the limits of their little Kingdom used the
same plenitude of authority, as appears by the Charter of Kenulphus, who
lived about the year 850. made to the Abbot of Abingdon, wherein he says, --
Sit autem praedict' rus liberum ab omni regali obstaculo, and Episcopali jure,
in sempiternum aevum, ut habitantes ejus nullius regis aut ministrorum suorum,
Episcopive aut suorum officialium jugo deprimantur, sed in omnibus rerum
eventibus ac defensionibus causarum Abbatis Abbindenensis, Monasterii de
caetero subjiciantur, Term. Trinitat. 1 H. 7. f. 18. b. And it is there said by
the Judges, fol. seq. b. that many Abbeys in England, had larger words then
these in the Kings Charter, as, Omnimoda justitia and quicquid regales
potestates conferri possunt.

To leave the Saxon Kings, and to come to the Normans, that we may see by what
channel this fluent of authority has been deduced to his Majesty. Lanfranc
Archbishop of Canterbury, in the Conquerours time, would have given the
Abbotship of S. Augustines, but the new King, (says the book) i. William the
Conqueror, did deny it, saying, that he would confer all Pastoral Staves in
his Realm, and would not confer that power to any whatsoever. Govern you
(says he) that which appertains to faith and Christianity among the Monks,
but for their outward service, you shall let me alone with that.

You see here, that the King does not in covert manner, or by little and
little, creep into Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, but with an absolute
resolution, whilst he yet stood as it were but upon the threshold of his
Kingdom, and might justly fear some notable transmutation in discontenting his
Clergy, the half arch of his Kingdom, even then he forbear not to contest
with them upon points of jurisdiction, confining theirs unto matters of faith,
and extending his own to the uttermost limits of the outward government of the
Church. But because his hand and his seal do more authentically enforce
credit, then the report of Authors and Historians, see what he assumeth in his
Charter of foundation of the Monastery Sancti Martini de bello, commonly called
Battle Abbey, for that he built it (as Romulus did the Capitol) in the place
where he overcame his enemies. In this Charter he grants that, That Church
shall be free from all servitude, and from all things whatsoever man's invention
can imagine, -- and commands therefore that it be free from all government of
Bishops -- neither shall the Bishop of Chichester, though it be in his
Diocese, make any Ordinations there, nor grieve it in any thing, nor execute
any kind of government, or authority there; but that it be as free (says he)
from all his exactions, as my own Dominicall (or Demesne) Chapel. The Abbot
shall not be compelled to go to the Synod, nor forbidden to promote his Monks
to holy Orders, where himself lists; nor he, or his Monks to require what
Bishop they will to consecrate Altars, etc. And this also by my Regal
authority, -- I ordain, that the Abbot shall be Lord and Judge of all things in
his own Church, and within one league round about it, etc. see the Charter at
large. Here it appears, that this victorious King Will. 1. took himself to
have, Pallium Ecclesiasticae jurisdictionis, the fullness of Ecclesiastical
power; and as the supreme Magistrate thereof, not only abridgeth and revoketh
the jurisdiction of other Bishops within this place, as of the Archbishop of
Canterbury, and the Bishop of Chichester, but disposes the same according to
his own pleasure, namely, to the Abbey of Battle, with so great enlargement
of privilege and authority, as no Bishop of the Kingdom has the like. Free
from all servitude, and from all things whatsoever man's invention can imagine,
are exquisite words of privilege, and how far they might stretch at those
times, (when the profession of our Laws was not a science) into Regal, or
Canonical jurisdiction, I cannot judge: but I know by Staffords case, 1 H. 7.
f. 18. they will now be restrained with many exceptions. So likewise, that the
Abbot shall not be compelled to come at Synods, or to take Ordinations for his
Monks, or Consecration of Altars, etc. from the Bishop of his Diocese, Nec
aliquis Episcoporum in Dioecesi collega^ suum super-grediatur. Con. Carthag. c.
19. Burchard li. 1. ca. 64.
are directly against the Decrees of the Church, Canons, Synods, and general
Councels. As also it is, that he should be Judge of things in his own Church,
and the circuit assigned, which though here it be but a league, I see not, but
he might as well have made it ten, if it had pleased him, and by consequence a
County, or Province. And lest the King should seem to have done this by some
indulgence from the Pope, or connivency of his own Clergy, he says expressly,
that he does it by his Regal authority, and that not closely, or underhand,
but Episcoporum and Baronum meorum attestatione. And to declare how far the
Clergy of that time was from repining or impugning this his jurisdiction, the
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishops of Chichester, Winton, and Worcester, are
witnesses to the Charter, and denounce a curse against the breakers thereof.
One other thing also is worthy of note, that the Kings Demean Chapel, seems
by this, not to be within the jurisdiction and Diocese of any Bishop, but
exempt and as a Regal peculiar reserved only to the visitation and immediate
government of the King, or such as it pleases him to substitute; for the
Archbishop of Canterbury has no jurisdiction there by his own confession, ut
pat. Hoveden l. 4.7. pa. 547.

William Rufus in like manner told Anselme Archbishop of Canterbury, that no
Archbishop or Bishop of his Kingdom should be subject to the Court of Rome, or
to the Pope, -- Quod nullus Archiepiscopus vel Episcopus regni sui (says Mat.
Paris.) curiae Romanae vel Papae subesset. And because Anselm asked leave of
him to fetch his pall from Pope Vrbane at Rome, -- hanc ob rem (says Mat.
Paris.) a rege majestatis reus postulatur; he is called in question of High
Treason, and Gundulphus Bishop of Rochester, and very many other Bishops
approved the accusation; In vita Will. 2. p. 17. and 18. Malmsbery reports
that his offense was for appealing to the Pope in matters between the King and
him; but he agrees that all he had was confiscate, and himself banished by
consent of the Bishops; and he adds further, that being after recalled into
the Kings favor, upon a new difference between the King and him, he appealed
the second time to Pope Vrbane, and without the Kings license would go thither,
for which cause his whole Bishopric and goods were reseised into the Kings
hands, and he exiled. And though the Pope threatened to excommunicate the King,
if he restored him not, and the Council then holden at Rome, stormed much at
the matter, yet Anselm continued in that plight during the lives both of the
King and the Pope.
