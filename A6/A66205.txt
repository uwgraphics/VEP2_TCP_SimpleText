FOR the Imploring a Blessing from Almighty God, upon His Majesty, and all His
Dominions, and for the Averting of those Judgments which our manifold Sins and
Provocations have most justly deserved; and that God would, in His great Mercy
and Goodness, Relieve and Comfort such as Suffer Abroad for the Protestant
Religion; The Kings most Excellent Majesty (by the Advice of His Privy Council)
has thought fit, and does hereby Appoint and Command, That a General Fast, and
Day of Solemn Humiliation be Religiously Kept and Observed throughout His
Majesty's Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of Berwick upon
Tweed, in most Devout and Solemn manner, on Wednesday the Fifth Day of April
next. And for the more Orderly Solemnizing of the said Fast, His Majesty has
given Directions to the Right Reverend the Bishops of this Kingdom, to Compose
a Form of Prayer suitable to this Occasion, to be used in all Churches and
Chapels, and other Places of Public Worship, and has given Charge for the
Dispersing thereof through their several Dioceses in the whole Kingdom. And His
Majesty does most strictly Charge and Command, That the said Fasting and
Prayers be Soberly, Reverently and Decently Performed by all His Loving
Subjects, as they tender the Favor of Almighty God, and upon Pain of receiving
such Punishment as His Majesty can justly Inflict upon all such as shall
Contemn or Neglect so Religious and Necessary a Duty.

Given at Our Court at Kensington the Twelfth Day of March, School/9. In the
Eleventh Year of Our Reign.
