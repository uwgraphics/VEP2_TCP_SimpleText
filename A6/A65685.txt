To the Right Honorable Sir Patient Ward Knight, Lord Mayor of the City of
London: And to all and every the Honorable the Judges of either Bench, Barons
of the Exchequer, Commissioners of Oyer and Terminer and Jail-deliver for this
Sessions held for the City of London and County of Middlesex. The Humble
Petition of Edward Whitaker Gent. Prisoner in the Tower of London,
Most humbly shows,
THat your Petitioner having lain under a Close Imprisonment, in the said
Tower, for about the space of Four months, by virtue of a Warrant of Commitment
for High Treason, under the Hand and Seal of Sir Leoline Jenkins Knight, one of
His Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex, as by the Copy
of Commitment appears; who by color of his being Secretary of State, committed
your Petitioner (though but a mean Commoner) to the said Tower, not only
against the Common Law of this Land, but also against the Statute made in the
Fifth year of Henry the Fourth, which provides, That no Justice of Peace shall
commit any Person but to the Common Gaol; nor is there any Provision in that
Statute, that a Secretary shall have power to commit to an unlawful Gaol, more
than other Justices of Peace.

That by Law there is no Prison of State in England for Commoners, nor was the
Tower of London ever made use of as a Prison of State, but by Parliament, and
the King and Council, for great Personages, out of respect to their Quality.
Your Petitioner lying under this Oppression, petitioned this Court last
Sessions to be Tried or Bailed, according to the Statute of the 31 of this
King; and then prayed your Honors who were of the Degree of the Coif to grant
your Petitioner a Habeas Corpus upon the said Statute, to bring your Petitioner
before your Honors, in order to such Ends: He believing then (as still he
does) that such Writ could not be denied him, without the Forfeiture mentioned
in the said last-recited Act; which Act was never intended to be defeated or
evaded by any Tower or Fort in England. For that your Petitioner well knows,
that a Commission of Oyer and Terminer being in Execution in any City or
County, the Commissioners that act therein have power to bring any Person
before them, from any Prison whatever within the said City or County, to be
tried or acquitted by the Course of Common Law; much more since the making of
the said Statute for securing the Liberty of the Subject, which was so
intended, and not that the said Tower, which is in London and Middlesex, should
debar any Person from having the Liberty of a Subject, contrary to the known
Law of the Land.

That your Petitioner being an innocent Person, and a free born Subject of
England, cannot but expect the full Benefit of the Law, as his just due; and is
well assured, that if an Indictment was found against him at this or any other
Sessions, the Writs of Habeas Corpus ad deliberandum and recipiendum would
certainly be of power enough to bring your Petitioner to that Court to be
Tried, without any Scruple in Law, as also any other Habeas Corpus upon the
said Statute. And your Petitioner conceives there is the same Justice in
granting your Petitioner such Writs, to discharge him, if nothing be against
him after so long Imprisonment, as to bring him to be Tried and Condemned.

That your Petitioner conceives the Laws of the Land are the only Bulwarks
which preserve the Nation, and every individual Commoner (in their just Rights)
from Violence: The Kings of England being sworn to maintain the Laws; and such
of your Honors as are Judges are sworn to administer Justice indifferently
between the King and His Subjects, and not delay or deny Justice to any Person.
Upon these Considerations, your Petitioner not being the last Sessions,
according to his Petition, Tried or Bailed, as was then prayed, and your
Honors not granting him his Habeas Corpus, as desired, according to the said
Statute of this King;

Tour Petitioner therefore now most humbly prays your Honors (as his Right by
Law) to be discharged from his Imprisonment this Sessions: And that your
Honors will grant your Petitioner an Habeas Corpus to the Constable or
Lieutenant of the Tower, to bring your Petitioner and set him before your
Honors, in order to be discharged from his Imprisonment according to Law.

And your Petitioner shall ever pray, etc, Edward Whitaker.
