By the King.
A Proclamation against Pirates.
THe Kings Majesty, having been informed through the manifold complaints made
to his Highness by his own Subjects as others, of the many depredations and
Piracies committed by lewd and ill disposed persons, accustomed and habituated
to spoil and rapine, insensible and desperate of the peril they draw upon
themselves, and the imputation they cast upon the honor of their Sovereign so
precious to him, as for redress thereof he is enforced to reiterate and
inculcate his loathing and detestation not only of the crimes, but also to
manifest to the world his sincerity and exceeding desires for the due and
speedy suppressing of the delinquents; And having lately found by many pregnant
circumstances, that most of these great faults are continued by the conniuence,
or corruption in many the subordinate Officers, especially such as are resident
in and near the Ports and Maritine Counties: In his Princely care to preserve
Justice, as one of the maine pillars of his Estate, and for the speedy
prevention of such foul crimes, and the severe punishment and extirpation of
such enormious offenders (most hateful to his mind, and scandalous to his
peaceable government) and for the preservation and continuance of amity and
good correspondencie with all other Princes and States, has with the advice of
his Counsel thought it necessary at this present, to publish these Articles
and Ordinances ensuing: Wherein if any shall be found culpable, refractory, or
contemptuous, his Majesty is resolved and hereby declares, that such
punishment shall be inflicted on him or them so offending, that others may be
exemplarily forewarned, from committing so odious factes, and be deterred from
ayding, relieuing, comforting, or abetting such and so enormious malefactors.

IF any person whatsoever shall upon the Seas, or in any Port or haven, take
any Ship that does belong to any of his Majesty's Subjects, friends, or Allies,
or shall take out of it by force, any goods of what nature or quality soever:
he or they so offending shall suffer death, with confiscation of lands and
goods, according to the Law in that case provided. IF any person or persons so
offending, do at any time hereafter come into any Port or place of his
Majesty's dominions, his Majesty expressly charge all his Officers forthwith
to apprehend him and them, and to commit them to prison, without Bail or
Mainprize, and that the name of the person and cause of his imprisonment, be
forthwith certified into the Admiraltie, that speedy order may be taken for
further proceeding, and execution according to Law, and the contents of his
Majesty's former Proclamations. ALl his Majesty's Subjects shall forbear from
furnishing, Victualing, ayding, receiving, relieuing, comforting or abetting,
any Pirate or Sea-rouer, or any person not being a known Merchant, by
contracting, buying, selling, bartring or exchanging with him or them, upon
peril of his Majesty's heavy indignation, and the grievous pains by Law
belonging to the same. ALl Admiral causes shall be summarily heard by the Judge
of the Admiraltie without admitting any unnecessary delay, and no Appeal from
him shall be allowed to the defendant or defendants in cases of depredations or
spoil, either for the Offenders, or their accessaries before or after the
offense committed, or those in whose possession the goods spoiled are found,
unless first by way of provision the sum adjudged be paid to the plaintiff
upon Suerties to repay it, if the Sentence shall be reuersed. And no Prohibition
in such causes of depredation and spoil, and their accessories and dependants
shall be hereafter granted against the Admiraltie. NO Ship or goods taken from
any his Majesty's friends, shall be delivered upon any other order, then upon
proof made, or certificate exhibited in the said Court of the Admiraltie, to
the end that a Record may be kept of all such restitutions made to strangers,
to serve if occasion shall require.
