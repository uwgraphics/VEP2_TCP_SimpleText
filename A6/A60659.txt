To all the Faithful in Christ Jesus.
Precious and welbeloved Lambs, natural branches of the only Vine, fruitful
plants in the Heavenly Vineyard, babes born again of Immortal Seed, who stands
in the fear and council of the Lord God, with a free Resignation into his
blessed will, following his leadings in sincerity and truth; ye are his
Jewels whose amiable beauty adorns the Gospel, and unto you his love is very
dear, and his eye is over you in much tenderness and choiceness, freely
dispensing his precious virtue to your refreshment and comfort, whereby ye
feel all things added for your support and strength in the great work whereunto
he has called you; so that ye are daily supplied from the riches of an
Everlasting fountain that sends relief in every condition wherein ye stand
to serve the Lord; for he has made you near to himself in a perpetual
covenant, and in the light has set you apart to bear witness unto his power,
life and truth; and ye are raised as a cloud of witnesses that covers the
Earth with brightness and glory, and your faithful Testimony that ye have
received of God, and in which ye live unto God is a sweet savor unto the life
in all; for in your faithfulness, patience, and innocence you make way to the
Just which witnesses for you: And though your life be hated by that Spirit
which would not have it reign, and that ye suffer and endure great affliction
by your oppressors; yet in your meek and innocent life you reach Gods witness
in them, by which they are many times smitten for what they do unto you; so
that ye are manifest in their Consciences, though they be from that in
themselves, which makes you manifest, and in cruelty proceeds against you from
evil to worse, that (if possible) they might darken your Glory, and bring down
your holy Testimony into obscurity, and for that end they take occasion against
you whom God has chosen to follow his leadings, and you must either transgress
the command of your Leader, and deny his Spiritual Worship, or be exposed to
the severity of merciless men, and rendered Offenders by a pretended Law, and
this is determined against you, and done unto you, because they know not him
that has raised you in your living Testimony.

But Oh, how do these things work together for good unto all that love God; how
does it quicken the true birth unto watchfulness and faithfulness; how does it
enliven unto freeness and cheerfulness to do the will of God, and brings down
the showers of life upon all the single and upright hearted: Oh my dear friends
these purposed and practiced cruelties of Sions enemies does much advance her
glory, and works good for all her Children though wickedly intended against
them; for, thereby our faith is tried and strengthened, our peace increased and
multiplied, and in the hour we are preserved.

Oh dear Lambs, be ye strong in the Lord, for you are not forsaken though you
may be cast down, you are not extinguished as tow, though in the fire you be
tried; but with mercy you are compassed in the Salvation of God; and this he
works for you who is Lord of all, that has all power in his hand, and in his
power rules over darkness, and enmity, and preserves Sion in the midst of her
troubles; for the Remembrance of Sion is always with him, yea in the very time
when she sits in the dust bewailing; therefore let the Babes rejoice, and the
plant be fruitful, let the weak put on strength, and the mourner be comforted,
for of a truth God is with us, and he will not hold them guiltless that any way
oppress us: So be not discouraged thou innocent birth, but keep close to thy
God, and trust in him who has raised thee, and let not thy Faith fail within
thee, then thou will go comfortably in the Holy Testimony; and rejoice over all
that would suppress the truth in thee, for the Lord God is assuredly with thee
in all thou suffers for him, and in all he calls thee unto, his arm sustaines
thee; and though he permit darkness for a time to try thee, yet his love and
good will is to thee, and his pleasure and delight is in thee, and thou have
had experience of his favor toward thee, and knows how thou have been
succored in thy adversity, and wonderfully delivered out of thy Captivity. Oh
therefore keep thy eye to him that has never failed thee, nor never will fail
thee as thou abides in his council; let not the world entice thee, nor
flatteries prevail with thee, nor fears dismay thee, but follow thy God who
is greater then all, so will his hand keep thee for being plucked out, and
though thou may be in the Furnace of affliction, and may feel it sharp and
tedious to endure, yet from thence he will take thee, and as well refined Gold
will bring thee forth to his praise for ever.

So all dear Friends every where, wait in that which makes you sensible of
your own conditions, that you may feel to Christ your life and hope of glory,
your helper, preserver and deliverer; so you will be stayed with a sure anchor
in a troublous time, and will feel the springings of life to revive the hope of
Israel, and then your Faith will not be driven to Shipwreck though storms be
high and violent, but will be preserved and strengthened unto a further growth
in the power which raises the seed, and this is testified in the power that ye
may have strong consolations in the midst of your affliction, and in the
testimony all glory is given to the power as most worthy? Oh, a stayed mind in
the power is exceeding precious, for there the Birth lives in that which is
eternal, and feeds upon the virtue in which it delights, and in stayedness,
stillness and quietness, the heavenly glory rests upon it, and so there is a
living sensibleness of the deep love and life of God, in which ye abiding, ye
will attain unto wisdom and understanding in the seed, and feel the Image of
God in you restored again, and so come to lie down in Christ Jesus your rest
and peace.

And now dear beloved Friends, be steadfast in the Faith, and hope to the end,
for the end will manifest all things, and as ye abide in the patience you will
overcome; and as you keep the Faith you will obtain victory, and the Crown
will be yours.

Dear and tender hearts, you may read the dearness of my love in the lines of
Life, where I lie down with you in the bond of peace, beseeching you all to
have fervent love amongst your selves, and keep your eye single one over
another, and entertain no exceptions one against another, for there is a
watching eye that is not single, and that will take occasion to make a fault
where there is none, and then will be exceptions, and raise a whisper to
accuse; but the true birth that lives in the true love, it covers faults as
they happen through weakness, and restores again in the Spirit of meekness, and
so in the power that gives life unto its Testimony, it judges presumptious
pride and arrogance, and covers faults that happens through weakness or
infirmity, and rest^res that again which mourns because it has offended; and
so it reaches to its own in tenderness, and condiscends to the lowest that
travailes after Righteousness, but unvaileth all feigned subtilty that would
exalt it self over the Royal innocence, for the light discovers and
unvaileth the mystery of Iniquity, and judges Infallibly, and none by wilt or
reason can either add unto it, or diminish from it; therefore all dear
Friends, live in that which keeps the mind low in the fear and counsel of
the Lord God, that in wisdom and understanding ye may have clear discerning,
and so in sound judgment reach to the oppressed with mercy, that ye may break
down the nature of the Oppressor, and restore and heal the grieved Birth that
is ready to confess and forsake that which through weakness has been done
amiss, and here ye will have the Sovereign balm that heals the wound
safely, and not sleightily, and so you will be a comfort one to another, even
as ye are sensible that the Lord comforts you, in which work the Almighty God
confirm and strengthen you all to the glory of his Power, Life and Wisdom for
Evermore.

The Salutation of my Life in the heavenly love unto every Babe that Secretly
pants to do the Will of God.

This may be read among friends as freedom is given, being a true token of my
love (in a few words) as moved of the Lord.

Nottingham County Goal, the 3d day of the 4th month, 1665. W. S.
