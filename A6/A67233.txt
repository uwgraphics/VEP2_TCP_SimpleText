To THE RIGHT HONORABLE AND TRULY VIRTUOUS LADY, the LADY KATHARINE D'AR^I,
These following POEMS are by the AUTHOR, Humbly DEDICATED and PRESENTED.

TO The Reader.
ANd now Reader I dare be bold to tell thee, that thou have something of true
worth and value within these leaves, since the foregoing Schedule has
acquainted thee with the name of a LADY who is exemplarily eminent, in every
real perfection. It may be thou will expect I should add a word or two, as
to the contents of the Book thou art about to look into; and it shall be
only this; That, I can assure thee, it will neither wound, nor defile the hand
that takes it up.

CERTAIN Serious thoughts: Which at several times and upon sundry occasions
have stolen themselves into Verse, and now into the public view.
SOmetimes a well-aymd thought would point at Heaven
But O mine heart,
That broken Bow, carrying the shaft on even
Aside does start:
Lord! that I may not, from that mark decline
Let my frail Ew be backed with the true Vine,
And give me Arrows winged from above
With the sure flying feathers of the Dove,
Then guide my hand, and make me level right
And it is thy honor if I hit the White.
On the 6. parts of Prayer.
MY 1Supplications often have prevailed,
Nor have my 2Deprecations often failed;
My 3Intercessions have been heard by thee;
But Lord! 4Confession best-becommeth me;
For all thy love; for giving and forgiving,
Accept the Sacrifice of my 5Thanksgiving;
Little I say by 6Imprecation,
More, then, in all things, let Thy will be done.
Going to the Sacrament of the LORDS
SUPPER.
THou ever-blessed Savior, at thy death
By by-partite Indenture did bequeath
Thy body, blood, and merits to each one
Whose grace-instructed faith cal's them his own,
Whose sin-avoyding Actions do proclaim,
Him an Adorer of thine holy Name.
Till thou O Lord, or call, or come again,
Let me not violate the Counter-pane,
Go with me, O my gracious God, and give
Life to my Faith, that I by Faith may live.
On a particular Occasion.
Rouse thee my too forgetful Muse; rehearse
Th'Almightie's goodness in a thankful verse,
He only showed thee trouble, sent relief
When best-applyed means but added grief,
He to his servants prayer had regard,
And turned his Chastisments to a reward.
ANOTHER.
SHall cunning Satan still defraud my soul
And steal into my heart by gilded sins?
He can make splendid, what is never so foul;
He knows not how to end, who once begins
To taste his sly deceits; beware, he will give thee
Poison in sweetened pills, and so deceive thee.
Upon PSALM 90. 10.
First written upon a bare leaf in QUARLES His Poems, over against his verses
on Mors tua.

GReat God! this death-beleaguerd Fort called Man
Though strongly backed by nature, seldom can
Out-last the seventeeth year; though thou afford
To my sin-stained life that number, LORD
The third part of them have already slip't
Me too regard less; Satan still has nipt
Thy blooming crop, my weak resolves have bin
Swift to dissolve into accustomd sin,
O let the uncertain remnant of my days
Be dedicated to my Makers praise;
O that this lump of dust knod-up in blood,
Would once leave trifles, and pursue what is good.
Fear then I would not; though a voice should say,
Thy glass is run, and thou must dye to day,
For so from sin, and sorrow should I rest;
And rise, not unto judgment, but a feast;
That marriage-Supper, which, we read, of old
Was by the Bridegroom, to the Jews foretold:
That marriage Supper, where to heavens King
Blessed souls eternal Alleluja's sing.
Upon PSALM. 7. 12. 13, 14. God is a righteous Judge, strong and patient: and
God is provoked every day.

If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword: he has bent his bow, and
made it ready.

He has prepared for him the instruments of death: he ordains his Arrows
against the Persecutors.


Have thou not heard O man, or can forget
This terrible Alarm, God will whet
His sword, prepare his Arrows, and his bow;
Does not experience daily bid thee know
That, when he will revoke thy borrowed breath
A Fly or Gnat's an Instrument of death,
Can thou shake off those thoughts which whisper to thee,
This minut's sin for ever may undo thee?
Will not thy headstrong Will be curbed by
The thought of fathomless Eternity?
Or does thy weak conceit befoole thee so
As once to think that God, though he be slow
To punish, see's not when thou go astray,
That thus thou dars't provoke him every day?
If man return not do thou say? is then
The power of turning in the choice of men?
My soul Lord know's it is not, yet I see
By thy command, what I should beg of thee;
Nor can I beg till thou my God prepare,
My un-prepared heart and voice to prayer.
From my wast-field if any good proceed,
Thou must be Author both of Will and Deed:
Stub-up the thorns, un-pave the soil and make
The well-injected seed deep rooting take,
Afford me fruitful seasons that I may
Bring some sheafs with me on my judgment day.
Upon MATTHEW. 10. 34.
CAme then the God of peace to send the sword?
Does variance accompany his word:
Must all those sacred knots nature does tie
In Father, Mother, Brothers, Sisters dye;
Truth has if self deposed it, and I must
Believed how-ever strange, yet sure it is just.
Nor does Religion cancel or withstand,
Or any way abbreviate that command:
Whereby we duty-bound to Parents are,
Nor Charity and love does it impare,
To other friends; what is theirs, to them impart
We may, we must, and yet choose Mary's part:
He, whose direction only point's-out Right
The most disjoynted souls can reunite,
And so cement a friendship by his word
Too strong to be dissolved by the sword.
On a particular occasion.
IN thee alone my wearied thoughts can find,
Where to repose their doubts: my settled mind,
On thee secure depends, great God arise;
Thy timely goodness to our wondering eyes
May banished joys reduce, here fixed be
My deaded hopes, and fetch new life from thee.
Thy wonted mercies often shown before,
Imbolden my weak verse thus to implore
Thy powerful aid, who, ever more then I
By blessed experience, could thy love discry?
In trouble, sorrow, sickness, fear and grief,
My case, to thee commended, met relief.
My sins though many, cancelled by thee
Shall neither prejudice my suit, nor me.
I will not doubt, my God I know can do it
My God I know can do it, I will not doubt.
A Domino factum est istud.
Nor was there ever any had recourse
To him by humble prayer that sped worse;
For this, my heart within me shall rejoice,
In all distresses thou shall hear my voice;
And if at any time, my suite ungranted,
Return, I Will think it is better for me wanted.
To Master WROTH Schoolmaster at EPPING in ESSEX.
THose recollective Thoughts to me,
Most welcome, SIR, must ever be;
Which to my memory represent,
The time, under your roof I spent;
Though spent improvidently, there
Large fields of corn for reaping were:
Yet I but gleaned, which make's my starved Muse
Such lean, ill-thriven verses now produce.
I might have learned how to Decline
All Vices; and Form by Divine
Sweet Conjugations, my Sense
To due and fitting Mode and Tence:
You the Pronouns, mine and thine did teach
To be no more but Parts of Speech;
From you a General rule I might have got
To use the world, as though I used it not.
But Oh, how Zions plants would thrive and like,
If it were fenced round with such a Dike
As he, whose pithy Sermons double were
In number, to the Sabbaths in the year;
Who, summoned up to heaven, back has sent
His Posthume book to attend the Sacrament.
Nor is it from Ingratitude, that in
The middle of my nonage I begin:
Unto his Care my childish years were given,
Whose Cure now poynt's us out the way Heaven.
Too few such men are found in any age
As was the Guardian of my pupill-age;
He scorned the common road, did not discharg
By some raw scarce-made Bachilor his charge.
Lord I admire thy providence, and see
How vast a sum I am in debt to thee,
But nothing have to pay: if thou do call
For an account, behold, forgive me all
Is all I can produce; O cross the score,
And make my love proportionably more.
Scindimur incerti.
CAn man's distracted fancy find the way
To truth; where thousand sects themselves display
Supporting error? This terrestrial round
has scarce a place where Verity is found.
ASIA.
ASIA, which only, glories to have ^een
A spotless man, where Canaan has been
A type of Heaven, and the blessed abode
Of the whole world's creator Jacob's God,
Where all the sacred penmen once did preach,
Nay, where the Lord himself vouchsafed to teach,
Wallow's in darkness now their Sun is set,
With bended knees they crouch to Mahomet;
And in the stead of Sinai's Law-Divine,
The Talmude is received in Palestine.
AFRICA.
THough Hippo's Sainted-Bishop Augustine
Like a bright Lamp in Tunis once did shine;
In Aegipt, by St Mark, although were sown
The early seeds of true Religion,
Though Aethiopia's Eunuch did proclaim
The Lamb whom he mis-tooke till Phillip came;
All Is now erased, and a man may say
Nothing but error spreads in Africa.
AMERICA.
THis Spain-enriching newfound world, a gem
Once proffered to our Henry's Diadem;
With reverence to their puppet-zemes do pray,
Whilst to them they themselves become a prey.
Those devill-spirits every where appear,
Not honored though adored, served but for fear;
And yet this now in-fatuated flock
Shall know the Shepherds voice and Bridgroom's knock:
Their time of Gospell's next Religion may
Still bending West find out America.
EVROPE.
NO harbor where my Sea-tost ship may lie,
At Anchor, and expect felicity!
So many lands run over, and yet not see
A path directing to Eternity!
What hope remain's? in Europ, sure, he shall
That fly's Charybdis into Scyll fall.
Opinions here, as much as faces vary,
Some this, some that, some think the quite contrary.
Hence it is that every Nation may discover
Her armed Natives murdering one another.
Wa'st not from hence the King of France thought good,
To drench his Sisters Nuptials in blood?
Hence all the present foreign jarrs, and those
Where T^weed her flowing streams does interpose;
And as ashamed to hear wars threats again,
Hastens to hide her face within the Maine.
Poor Soul, thy wearied footsteps may in vain
Survey the universe, return again
As far from satisfaction as before,
Unless divine direction thou implore;
Lord teach my wary thoughts so to decline,
All devious paths, as to keep close to thine.
Upon 1 Cor. 3. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. For other foundation can no man lay, then
that which is laid Jesus Christ.

And if any man build on this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones,
timber, hay stubble;

Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because
it shall be revealed by fire: and the fire shall try every man's work of what
sort it is.

If any man's work that he has built upon abide, he shall receive wages.

If any man's work burn, he shall lose, but he shall be safe himself:
nevertheless, yet as it were by fire.


THe heaven-instructed Master Builder laid
Zions foundation, skilless men have reard
Their own inventions: some have wooden made
And saplesse doctrines, of small use when heard.
Others their hay-like withering Sermons vent,
No Scyth is sharper then their biting phrase;
Most bring us stubble, when the corn is spent,
And trifles prosecute with strained praise.
All these are combustible; send that fire
Thine holy Spirit, try, consume, refine,
Thy Prophets so with sacred truths inspire
That they may rectify each crooked line.
Us hearers such affections afford
As fit's a spiritual building to thee Lord.
Upon Amos 1. 11. Behold, the days come, says the Lord God, that I will send
a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of
hearing the words of the Lord.
IN sacred Scripture, I have sometimes read
A sorer famine threatened then of bread.
That judgments fallen on us. Where for a time
I sojourned, Westward in a Northern Clime,
Two Counties, for the lack of Wine unable
Were to invite us to the Holy Table;
This question rose, amongst discourse, about it,
May not the Sacrament be given without it?
Some said it might, some that again deni'de,
I dare not take upon me to decide,
Nor unto other do I aim to give
A Law: but for my own part thus conceive;
So God vouchsafe my souls repast to mak't
I care not though in Vinegar I take it,
FEB. 8. 1642.
It Is not base trembling, cowardice and fear
That mak's me in this fighting age, forbear
To draw my sword: but seem an useless thing
Perhaps, whilst others by adventuring
Gain glorious titles; for my Countries good
My steps would fearlesse march in Seas of blood,
And welcome certain ruin: yet I find
A war within my self, and stay behind.
Eternal blessings fasten on the Crown,
To Charles his head; God grant him all his own:
And may as long-lived curses fall upon
Their heads who honor not his Princely Son,
So from my heart I wish: and yet suspect
Many unsound will sound that Dialect:
The form-obtrudors may deform and make
Eneruous (whilst the Church of Rome does take
Advantage, and supplant Religion)
I Will not thrust in my hand to help them on.
Whose heart can less then bleed, whose head can be
Less then a spring of tears, when his eyes see
Distempered Zion, in this woeful plight,
Her ^un withdrawn, inveloped with night?
My willing Muse, so she were unperplext,
Could wish to sing her Nunc-Dimittis next.
Ho! all that love her, all that pass this way,
Contribute here your sighs, sit down to pray
And mourn, till God, all other hopes are vain,
Make up the breaches of his Church again.
Amen, So be it.
Lord say Amen, let it be so, that we
The beauty of thine holiness may see.
Vnum hoc, a te Domine, expetivi, usque immo and usque
Idem expetam: sacro-sanctae nempe ut aedis
Tuae incola, populi tui laetitia fruar,
Psallentique Israeli comes adjungar.
Si fractus elabatur Orbis Impavidum ferient ruinae:
Though all the Elements, like us, should jar
And wrap up ruined Nature by the war,
Though the worn Fabric of the spears above
Should, in disjoynted fragments, downward move,
And horrid Catarackts should headlong come
With swift descent, to make the world one tomb,
Yet should my feareless soul hope to epsy,
A place of safety in my Savior's eye.
That skillful chymist's never-failing art,
Can good, extracted out of ill, impart,
And even by her distresses rear a frame,
That Zions rebuilt glory may proclaim;
Which, if my longing eyes but live to see,
It Is Lord that one thing which I beg of thee.
Some footsteps of this War traced.
THe low-tun'd numbers of my humble Verse
Cannot this Scene of death to th'life rehearse,
I offer but one dish, and that I fear
Will, Reader, worth thy tasting scarce appear;
Yet may prepare thy stomach, thou will be
Hereafter feasted with the History;
Some cunning hand will strike so high a string,
That all the quarters of this Orb shall ring
The great achievements of our Nobles: they
Shall live in numbers that are lap't in clay,
And those that make Iambicks in their pace,
Shall, in Heroicks, run with nimble grace.
Here my engaged thoughts, could I but frame
A verse that worthy were to bear his name,
Would vent themselves and tell thee who did come
Though lame yet laden with much honor home.
At Worster, first the Tragedy begun;
From worse to worse, since that, we headlong run:
For follow Southward, and discover still,
The edge of War, but sharp'ned at Edg-hill:
Many tall Cedars fell, some shaken lie,
Yet discord bloomes again since Newbery.
Besides these three, how many Fields have been
Forced into blushing tinctures, from their Green
By flowing blood? This issue, though it be
Not twelve years old, o God by none but thee,
Is curable, unless the selfsame hand
That healed that woman save this bleeding Land,
We perish; all our thoughts amazed are,
On thee our eyes are fixed, thy people spare.
Sure some Prophetic spirit gave the name,
Unto that Village where, beside the Lame
Four thousand Christians all bereaved of breath
By fire-enraged Messengers of death,
The setting sun beheld, and at the sight
Hastened his Western journey, and sent night
To force a truce:
It Is called long- Mar-ston, yet Mars thy command
I wish may soon be shortened in this Land.
But can our wishes, which from flesh and blood,
And common-sence arise procure this good?
No, we have sinned, and each one must begin
To be impartial to his proper sin.
O let us to the throne of Grace repair
With true-repentant, humbly-servent prayer,
Presented in our Saviors Oratory,
Then God will Finis write to this sad story.
On the death of our Virtuous and dear friend Mistress Dorothy Warwick at
Marsk, Aug. 6th 1644.
IF only light griefs find a tongue; and those
That are extreme, cannot themselves disclose
Immured by stupid silence, surely then
Nothing but flowing tears must from my pen
Be-blur this paper: it is beyond the art,
Of language to express the smallest part
Of our deep sorrows for her loss, whose age
Scarce to the Summer of her Pilgrimage
Attained had; yet so ripe fruit, but few
After the Autumn of their years, can show.
No act of hers could be esteemed less,
Then one step forward to that place of bliss;
Where now her faith is crowned, and we find
Her sweet and precious memory behind.
Mors Mea.
My flitting Soul must leave her house of clay,
The tim's not more uncertain then the way
And manner, whether my consumptive breath
Shall leisurely-expiring creep to death,
Or some more furious, hasty sickness have
Commission to snatch me to my grave.
Water may cause or th'torrid element,
My dissolution by some accident.
Ten thousand means and more do this discry,
That young, strong, healthful, rich, and all may dye,
Though I escape chance, and sickness, yet I must
At length by age subdued crumble to dust.
I dare not wish, nor were it fit, to be
A carver for my self* my God, to thee
My willing soul resign's her fate, what s'ere
Thou layest on me, give me strength to bear.
Yet, if it stand with thy good pleasure, send
Not sudden death, nor sence-bereaved end.
And if thou'st honor with white hairs my days;
O teach me how to spend them to thy praise,
That when I shall forsake the sons of men,
My better part may fly to thee, Amen.
Mors Christi.
Thou Son of God, descending from above
Would manifest by that rare act thy love
To poor lost mortals; did vouchsafe to take
A death-subjected nature for our sake;
Nor did disdain to have thy sacred face;
Made by those stubborn Jews, their spitting-place.
Thou patient stood'st the object of their scorn,
Decked in a purple robe, and crown of thorn;
And Millions of such troubles having past,
A shamfull death thou underwent'st at last,
All this for us and more; for even as we,
Thou tempted wast, the cup was drunk by thee,
Which thy just-angry Father had prepared
To ransom man by Sathan's art ensnared.
Mine heart to thee's too poor an offering,
Who by once dying took'st away death's sting.
Fraus Mundi.
Fond man I why does thy fancy dote upon
Such nothings, as the world can call its own?
Why should such Ignes fatui divert,
Thy erring footsteps, or mislead thy heart?
Belike thy soul but little light injoy's,
For darkness gives the being to such toys.
Grant thou have honor, beauty, riches, pleasure,
Delitious fare with heaped sums of treasure,
All in superlatives; get one gem more,
Or else the former makes thee but more poor:
Nay thou must sell them all that one to buy,
If thou do mean to gain felicity.
Gloria Caeli.
Stay, do not black this Paper, for it is
A better Emblem of the place of bliss
Then my dull pen can draw; it is pure and white
May serve to represent eternal light;
Has neither spot nor wrinckle, none of them
May come within the new Jerusalem.
But how should paper, or my lines, which are
Composed both of rags, such joys declare
As never eye, nor ear, nor heart, nor brain
Of man within that small sphere could contain?
Yet may thy humble contemplation
Discern some glimpses by reflection:
Read then the glory of thy great Creator
In this large book the world, which is his Creature.
If wandering there thou chauncest to espy
An object that is glorious in thine eye,
Be it those greater, or the lesser lights
Innumerably sparkling in clear nights;
Or the those-emulating Diamond
That precious issue of enriched ground,
Does from some costly root a flower arise,
Whose various colors please thy gazing eyes.
Do thou admire the structure of some face,
Which seems to have engrossed every grace,
Have thou observed all the excellence,
Wherewith Gods bounty feast's each several sense?
Screw up thy meditation then, think, Lord
If to earth on earth thou art pleased t'afford
Such blessings, o thrice happy sure they be
Who sainted are in blessed Eternity.
Dolor Inferni.
Let not thy overcurious appetite
Thy puzzled cogitations invite,
To lose themselves in seeking hell, nor it
Beyond the pillars of the holy-Writ,
Think to discover: look not to advance,
Where God nil ultra writ's, thine ignorance.
But know that there does nothing want which can
Add tortures to that miserable man,
Who Is thither cast for sin; in that cursed place
Nature run's retrograde to her own pace;
Fire administers no welcome light,
But serv's in torment, and makes sad the night,
The parched tongue for water call's, but that
It Is cooling faculty has quite forgot,
By gnashing teeth and trembling yet is show'n
That Hell is not without a Frozen-Zone:
Once sleeping-conscience, then shall in despite
Awake, and make those sufferings exquisite.
What Vulture-Thoughts shall gnaw for evermore
That heart which proffered mercy scorned before?
All objects, by the ever-weeping eye,
Shall wound the Soul with cursed Eternity.
Now blessed Lord, inflame my keen desire
To seek that narrow path, which from this fire
May keep my steps secure: sure it is not that
To which some fancies give a shorter date,
No, purge me here, and make me lean upon
That sure foundation, the true Cornerstone.
FAITH.
TVrn over the sacred leaves, The Almighty has
By sweet gradations, opened to thy Faith
The word of promise, new-fal'n man has got
A newfound means, to spoil the serpent's plot.
For God has said; The woman's seed shall give
A wound unto thy head, that man may live.
Thence, through sucessive generations, trace
That more explayned Covenant of Grace:
Till, (from the world's beginning slain) the Lamb
Attended by a quire of Angels came,
In his rich bosom, bringing plenteous store
Of blessings, only pointed at before;
And then observe, what precious legacies
Thy bounteous Lord bequeath's thy soul, and dye's
To give thee life from both the Testaments,
And from the heaven-ordayned Sacraments,
Suck ever-flowing comfort: for to thee
As well, as any heretofore, agree
The still effectual promises, which stand
Now proffered to thy Faiths applying hand.
HOPE.
BVilt-upon this foundation, it is the scope
Of saving Faith's next coosen-german, Hope,
With patient longings to expect that bliss
Whereof, the former present earnest is.
Faith (in some sort) already Christ injoy's;
Hopes object are those consummated joys.
Fides intuetur verbum rei, spes autem rem verbi.
CHARITY.
ANd from the fruitful teeming womb of Faith
Each work of Charity beginning has;
From these the happy evidence is had
Which prove's them sons of God, whom faith has made.
What e're thy God or Neighbors good requires
Must be the serious bent of thy desires.
Else know that to those things which heavenly be
A mis-call'd Faith cannot entitle thee.
How dare presumptous have once think to make
Christ, Savior and not Lord: sit down and take
A survey of thine heart; though nothing there
Can justify thee, yet unless thou bear
The Image of thy God, and strive to frame
Thy likened conversation to the same,
Thou have no part nor share in him who gave
Himself to death, repentant man to save.
Now blush you Rhemish factors who have laid
Your envious heads together to upbray'd
With liberty a doctrine which has shown
Far better, strickter precepts then your own;
Perhaps you pick half sentences, and thence
Extract an unmeant Heresy and sense.
A cloud of reverend witnesses I might
Produce, which neither more nor less do write
As to this point (though not in rhyme) then lie
Here recollected, for the readers eye.
On GODS UBI QVITARY PRESENCE.
NO gloomy shades, nor darkened face of night
Can shrowed a sinner, from the quick-ey'd sight
Of all-discerning Heaven: God does rule
Beyond the controverted coasts of Thule.
And his unbounded justice does control,
The frozen vertices of either Pole.
All inter-fluent seas, all Regions stand
Subjected to the power of his command.
Then let not fancied secrecy invite
Thy deeds of darkness to out-black the night,
Nor though some foreign Clime thou wandrest in,
Where no known face can argue thee of sin,
Dare to let-loose thy rebell-soule, but know
There is a God above, see's all below:
Who shall hereafter be thy judge, and then
Thy barefaced crimes, unmask't before all men,
And Angels must appear, nay more, the Devils
Will aggravate, that prompted to, those evils.
December. 10. 1644.
HOw many contradictions daily come
Born on the wings of lying same! by some
We hear of Battles, stratagems, and sleights
Whilst others make them victories, or flights.
All various rumors struggle for belief
Whilst varying humors feed the present grief.
Once more, the hopeful terms of happy-peace
Salute's our greedy ears: O, may it please
The all-disposing power above, to frame
Our fitted hearts, to entertain the same.
Going to Bed.
THus, on a pale sheet, I extended, shall
Become ere long a livelesse coarse, and all
These too-much prized trifles, which retard
My soul in her best flights, without regard
Or relish, must be left: then, in my grave
Where all things are forgotten, I shall have
A cool and lonely lodging, by the earth
Lock't-up from all this worlds mis-called mirth.
If thou, O blessed Creator, shall restore
The peace, ease, plenty we enjoyed before,
Let not those over-valued blessings move
Our earth-bred thoughts to slight the things above*
Here Is no abiding City: but thy grace
May make the house of death a resting place.
Thou sacred Arbitrer of life and death,
Who summon'st, at thy pleasure, vitall-breath,
When in thy house, my elevated soul
Should mount to thee, yet lingring-here, does foul
Her self with terrene fancies make mine eye
Recall my thoughts, and preach mortality.
There lies those dear remembrancers, I have
Two parents, and two children in one grave;
In twice-two years, thy wisdom saw it best
To call these two sweet couples to their rest;
And since so near, on both sides, I have seen
Thine arrows to me, teach me how to weane
From this distempered globe, my mis-plac'd love
And fix it firmly on the things above.
Then if it shall please thee next to call on me,
I Will boldly leave this clay, and come to thee.
May 10. 1645.
Hearing the Birds sing after the departure of our dear MOTHER.
ANd can you sing poor birds? do you not see
A mourning countenance on every tree?
Does not each stone in this sad fabric, tell
What sable thoughts within these walls do dwell?
Since she who added sweetness to the spring,
To Summer glory, she whose care did bring
More fruit then Autumn, and from whom it was
That Icy-Winter undiscerned did pass,
Has left these habitations, my-thinks you
Should leave henceforth your warbling sonnets too,
Yet sing, but change your note and join with me,
Tune your loud whistles to an Elegy.
JUNE 8. 1645.
MVst then the fate of Yorkshire, and the North
Be tried once more by dint of sword, step-forth
Thou God of Battle, let the people see
By the success, which side is owned by thee.
-- Sub amici fallere nomen
Tuta frequensque via est --
Easy and undiscerned is the guile
Which brings on mischief ushered by a smile.
Thus many who arride the Commonweal
With joynt-pretences but disjoined design,
Their own with public interests intwine
The better, and more covertly to steal
Advantage to a party, putting on
A form of Paralell-expression,
Faced with Good and Safety; yet extend
Their actions and endeavors to the end
Of time, they will never meet, but hold a course
In lasting distance still, from ill to worse*
Hei mihi! qnas urbes, and quanto tempore Martis
Ignaras, uno rapuerunt praelia cursit?
Claudiani carmen.
Dum procerum mentes privata ad commoda torsae
