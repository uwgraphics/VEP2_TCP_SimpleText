YOUNG JEMMY. An Excellent New Ballad, To an Excellent New Tune.
[1]
YOung Iemmy is a Lad
That Is Royally descended;
With every Virtue clad,
By every Tongue commended:
A true and faithful English Heart;
Great Brittain's Joy and Hope,
And bravely will maintain their Part,
In spite of Turk and Pope.
[2]
Young Iemmy is a Lad
That hates all base Pretenses;
No Tory Masquerade,
With Popish Sham-Pretences;
A Heart and Soul so Great and Just,
Such Conduct and Command;
A Champion in his Countries Trust,
Young Iemmy still will stand.
[3]
Young Iemmy is a Youth,
Who thinks it no Transgression
To stand up for the Truth
And Protestant Profession;
But Oh! He fights with such Success,
All Mortal Powers obey;
No God of War but must confess
Young Iemmy bears the sway.
[4]
At Iemmy's powerful Voice
The Drums and Trumpets sounded;
And England did rejoice
When Iemmy's Fame abounded.
Of Iemmy the victorious Name
Did through all Europe fly,
And all the Nations did proclaim
His matchless Gallantry.
[5]
In Mastricht and in France,
In Germany and Flanders,
Young Iemmy did advance
Amongst the Chief Commanders:
By Sea and Land his Fame did fly,
And all the Nations round
Of Iemmy's Constant Victory
And Valor did resound.
[9]
In Scotland Iemmy's Hand
Dispersed the Whig and Tory;
And Bothwel-Bridge will stand
To his Eternal Glory:
There he the Rebels Force withstood,
And did Their Might oppose,
Both for the King and Countries Good,
In spite of all his Foes.
[7]
But Oh! unhappy Fates!
A Curse on Pride and Malice;
The Popish Plotting-States
Have banished him the Palice:
They turned him out of Grace of late,
Of Dignity and Fame,
And every mighty Place of State,
Yet Iemmy's still the same.
[8]
Maliciously they Plot
(Against all Sense and Reason)
Against Shaftsbury and Scot,
To Cloak their Popish Treason:
Tories and Papists all agree
To blast his spotless Fame;
But, 'spight of all their Policy,
Young Iemmy's still the same.
[9]
For, still to lose his Blood
Young Iemmy does importune,
And for his Countries Good
To spend his Life and Fortune,
For to support the Church and State,
Our Liberties and Laws,
Against their Malice, Plots and Hate
That would our Rights oppose.
[10]
Let all good men implore
For Iemmy's Restoration,
Whose Conduct must restore
The Ruins of our Nation;
That he to Charles's Praise may live
Our Freedom to maintain,
When Iemmy shall his Fame retrieve,
And be in Grace again.
