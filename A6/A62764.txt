To the Kings most Excellent Majesty.
The humble and dutiful REMONSTRANCE and ADDRESS of the APPRENTICES, and
other young Men of the several Regiments of Your MAJESTY'S Auxiliares in Your
City of London.
Humbly Shows,
THat We your Majesty's most obedient and faithful Subjects and Servants, duly
observing, not only the Clemency and Piety we so sensibly understand your
Majesty Naturally, as well as Successively inclinable to; but also your
Majesty's great Zeal and Princely Care of maintaining that happiness to us,
which our forefathers for so many ages rejoiced in, under the ancient
Fundamental Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom, together with the good
wholesome Doctrine and Discipline of the Church as it stood by Law established
in our glorious Martyrs days, by the Religious Government of the Reverend
Bishops and other Doctors of the Church, in whom are so great Mysteries locked
up, and without whom, you Majesty cannot be safe, nor we happy: of which
Church, to the glory of God, the amazement of your Enemies, the comfort of all
your Loyal Subjects, and the wonder of the World, your Majesty has continued
her Faiths Defender. And now, considering not only the coolness of some
persons to your Majestyes Service, from whom we had hopes of better things, but
also the unquietness of the Spirits of some others, who have in so great a
measure tasted of your Majesty's grace and favor, men of loose and dangerous
Principles, that have assisted in the staining of the Records of this Your
City, so famous for Loyalty in former ages; We thought our selves obliged in
Duty to God, in Obedience to Your Majesty, in affection to our Country, and in
love and honor to this your City, as well as to that Interest to which we have
a future hopes (having first, according to our duty, applied our selves to that
so eminent a Pattern of Fidelity and Vigilance to your Majesty's service, the
Right Honorable the Lord Mayor of this your City:) To Remonstrate, That we
are here before your Sacred Majesty, in humility of Spirit, ready to
sacrifice our Lives and Fortunes in the Defense of your Majesty's Interest,
Crown and Dignity, with the Interest of Religion, as it is by Law established;
sensibly knowing, that nothing, like to fearing God, honoring the King, and not
meddling with those who are given to change, can make us delight in Loyalty, as
our Predecessors for many Generations have done; without which we cannot, as
now we do, from the integrity of our hearts, with an humble confidence,
subscribe our selves

Your MAJESTY'S Most Loyal, and most Obedient Subjects and Servants.
This Address was subscribed by the several Regiments at or before the Last
General Rendezvous, and Presented by the Colonels to his Majesty, on Tuesday
the 14th of this instant May, for which they received his Majesty's Thanks.
