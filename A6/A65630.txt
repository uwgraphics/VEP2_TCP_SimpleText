THE WHIGG and TORY's Friendly DIALOGUE, OR, Admonition to Unity, as the
greatest help and inlet to peace and quietness.
To the Tune of, Hey Boys up go We.
Whigg. NOw now yon Tories pray give over,
run not the poor Whiggs down,
Although they cannot damn and whore
yet they may love the Crown:
And love in heart their Sovereign Charles,
all Reasons will allow,
As well as those, Gods Laws oppose,
and to an Altar bow.

Tory. Hold Whigg, you Tongue is too profuse,
then do more inveigh,
Against us that were never his Foes,
but for him still do pray:
We Will venture Lives and Forunes too,
his right for to maintain,
Whilst you do strive, for to deprive,
the Heir we would have Reign.

Whigg. It Is our design for to be free
from dangers that do threaten,
You know there was a time when we
by no Men could be beaten:
You think to get the upper hand,
and then to make us bow,
But it is believed, you are deceived,
where is Tory Thompson now?

Tory. It Is true, once Cromwell led your Van,
you owned him as you head,
And him you thought a famous Man,
who did the King behead:
For that a Curse upon this Land,
I fear there does remain,
But blessed be he, we hope to see,
after great Charles to Reign.

Whigg. The Pope would England overcome,
which I hope never to see,
If we should subject be to Rome,
in what a case were we:
How many Martyrs suffered Death,
that did refuse to bow
To Idols, therefore lost their breath,
but where is Ned Coleman now?

Tory. Thou prattling Fellow, it is not that
which we desire to have.
Thou pratest of thou know not what,
our party to out-brave:
Though Monmouth is a Princely Man,
yet we will tell you plain,
We will deprive him if we can,
that York in time may Reign.

Whigg. Bet in the interim of time,
let Subjects all agree,
It is a matter so srbline,
it cannot determined be:
By Mortals, that in little time,
to death must stoop and bow,
Obey the King in every thing,
and let us be friendly now.

Tory. Now thou do like a Christian speak,
none knows who first shall dye,
The strong may go before the weak,
and in his cold Grave lie:
The young before the old may drop,
and fly from Death in vain,
It Is he our breaths must surely stop,
let whom God pleases Reign.

Printed for J. Deacon, at the Rainbow, near St. Andrews Church in Holborn,
1682.
