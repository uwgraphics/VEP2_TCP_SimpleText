A WARNING for Married Women.
Being an Example of Mrs. Jane Reynolds (a West-country Woman) born near
Plymouth, who having plighted her Troth to a Seaman, was afterward married to
a Carpenter, and at last carried away by a Spirit, the manner how shall
presently be recited.

To a west-country Tune, called, The fair Made of Bristol: or, John True.




THere dwelt a fair Maid in the West,
of worthy birth and fame,
Near unto Plymouth stately town,
Jane Reynolds was her name.
This damsel dearly was beloved,
by many a proper youth:
And what of her is to be said,
is known for very truth:
Among the rest a Seaman brave
unto her a wooing came,
A comely proper youth he was,
James Harris called by name.
The maid and young man was agreed,
as time did them allow,
And to e^ch other secretly
they made a solemn vow.
That they would ever faithful be,
whilst Heaven afforded life,
He was to be her Husband kind,
and she his faithful Wife.
A day appointed was also,
when they were to be married,
But before these things were brought to pass,
matters were strangely carried.
All you that faithful lovers be,
give ear and hearken well,
And what of them became of last
I will directly tell:
The young man he was pressed to Sea,
and forced was to go,
His sweetheart she must stay behind
whether she would or no.
And after he was from her gone,
she three years for him staid,
Expecting of his coming home,
and kept herself a maid.
At last news came that he was dead
within a Foraign Land,
And how that he was buried,
she well did understand.
For whose sweet sake the maiden she
lamented many a day:
And never was she known at all
the wanton for to play.
A Carpenter that lived hard by,
when he heard of the same,
Like as the other had done before,
to her a wooing came.
But when that he had gained her love,
they married were with speed,
And four years space (being man and wife)
they lovingly agreed.
Three pretty children in this time,
this lovely couple had,
Which made their father's heart rejoice,
and mother woundrous glad.
But as occasion served one time,
the good man took his way
Some three days journey from his Home,
intending not to stay.
But whilst that he was gone away,
a spirit in the night,
Came to the window to his wife,
and did her sorely fright.
Which Spirit spoke like to a man,
and unto her did say:
My dear and only love, quoth he,
prepare and come away.
James Harris is my name, quoth he,
whom thou did love so dear,
And I have traveled for thy sake,
at least this seven year.
And now I am returned again,
to take thee to my wife,
And thou with me shall go to Sea,
to end all further strife.
O tempt me not, sweet James (quoth she)
with thee away to go,
If I should leave my children small,
alas, what would they do?
My husband is a Carpenter,
A Carpenter of great fame,
I would not for five hundred pounds
that he should know the same.
I might have had a King's Daughter,
and she would have married me,
But I forsook her golden crown,
and for the love of thee.
'Therefore if thou wilt thy husband forsake,
and thy children three also,
'I will forgive thee what is past,
if thou will with me go.
If I forsake my husband and
my little children three,
What means have thou to bring me to,
if I should go with thee?
'I have seven ships upon the sea,
'when they are come to Land,
'Both Mariners and Merchandise
'shall be at thy command.
The ship wherein my love shall sail,
is glorious to behold,
The sails shall be of finest silk,
and the mast of shining gold.
When he had told her these fair tails,
to love him she began,
Because he was in humane shape,
much like unto a man.
And so together away they went,
from off the English shore,
And since that time the woman kind,
was never seen no more.
But when her Husband he came home,
and found his Wife was gone,
And left her three sweet pretty Babes
within the house alone.
He beat his breast, he tore his hair,
the tears fell from his eyes,
And in the open Streets he run,
with heavy doleful cries.
And in this sad distracted case,
he hanged himself for woe,
Upon a Tree, near to the place,
the truth of all is so.
The children now are fatherless,
and left without a Guide,
But yet no doubt the heavenly Powers
will for them well provide.
