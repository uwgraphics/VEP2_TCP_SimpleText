A Proclamacion, set furthe by the Kings Majesty, With thassent and consent
of his most dear Uncle Edward Duke of Somerset, Governor of his most royal
person, and of his dominions and Subjects Protector, and others of his
highness privy counsel, against enclosures, lettyng of houses to decaie, and
unlawful conuertyng of arable ground to pastures, the first day of June in
the second year of his majesty's most gracious reign.
Forasmuch as the kings Majesty, the Lord Protectors grace, and the rest of
his privy Counsel, has been advertised and put in remembrance, as well by
diverse supplicacions, and pitiful complaints, of his Majesty's poor
subjects, as also by other, wise and discrete men, having care to the good
order of the realm, that of late by the inclosyng of lands and arable
grounds, in diverse and sundery places of this realm, many have been driven
to extreme poverty, and compelled to leave the places where they were borne,
and to seek them livings in other countries, with great misery and poverty:
Insomuche, that where as in time past. x.xx. yea, in some place. C. or CC.
christian people, has been inhabityng and kept household to the bryngyng furthe
and norishyng of youth, and to the replenishyng and fulfillyng, of his
Majesty's realms with faithful subjects, who might serve both almighty
God, and the kings majesty to the defense of this realm, now there is
nothing kept, but sheep or bullockes: All that land which heretofore was
tilled and occupied with so many men, and did bring furthe not only diverse
families in work and labor, but also Capo^s, Hens, Chikons, Pigges and other
such furniture of the Merkettes, is now gotten by insaciable gredines of
mind, into one or two men's hands, and scarsely dwelled upon with one poor
Shephard: So that the realm thereby, is brought to a marvelous desolacion,
houses decayed, parishes diminished, the force of the realm weakened, and
Christian people by the gredy coueteousnes of some men, eaten up and devoured
of brute beasts, and driven from their houses by Sheep and Bullockes. And that
although of the same thing, many and sundery complaints and lamentacions, has
been heretofore made, and by the most wise and discrete Princes, his majesty's
father and grandfather, the kings of most famous memory, king Henry the.
VII, and king Henry the. VIII, with the consent and assent of the lords
spiritual and temporal, in diverse Parliamentes assembled, diverse and
sundery laws and acts of Parliaments, and most Godly ordinances, in their
several times has been made for the remedy thereof: Yet the insaciable
coueteousnes of men, does not cease daily to encroche hereupon, and more and
more to waste the realm, after this sort bryngyng arable grounds into
pastures, and lettyng houses, whole families, and Copiholdes to fall down,
decaie, and be waste: Wherefore, his highness is greatly moved, both with a
pitiful and tender zeal to his most loving subjects, and specially to the
poor, which, is minded to labor and trauaill for their living, and not to
live an Idle and loyteryng life: and of a most necessary regard, to the
suertie and defense of his realm, which must be defended against the
enemy, with force of men, and the multitude of true Subjects, not with
flocks of Sheep, and droues of Beasts: And further is advertised, that by the
ungodly and uncharitable means aforesaied, the said Sheep and Oxen, being
brought into a few men's hands, a great multitude of them being together,
and so made great droues and flocks, as well by natural reason, as also as it
may be justly thought, by the due ponishement of God, for such
uncharitableness: great Rottes and Muttins, both of Sheep and Bullockes, has
lately been sent of God, and scen in this realm, the which should not by all
reason so sone fall, if the same were disparsed into diverse men's hands, and
the said catell also, by all likelihode of truth should be more chepe, being
in many men's hands, then as they be now in few, who may hold them dear,
and tarry their advantage of the Merket: And therefore, by thaduise of his most
entierly beloved uncle, the Duke of Somerset Governor of his person, and
Protector of all his realms, Dominions, and Subjects, and the rest of his
Majesty's privy counsel, has waied most depely all the said things: And
upon the foresaied consideracions, and of a Princely desire and zeal, to se
that Godly laws, made with great trauaill and approved by experience, and by
the wise heddes, in the time of the said most prudent Princes, should not be
made in vain, but put in ure and execucion, has appointed, according to the
said Acts and Proclamacio^s, a view and inquiry to be made, of all such as
contrary to the said Acts and Godly ordinances, has made Enclosures and
Pastures, of that which was arable ground, or let any House, Tenement, or Mese
decay, and fall down, or otherwise committed or done any thing to the
contrary: of the good and wholesome articles, contained in the said Acts: And
therefore wills and commands, all his loving subjects, who knows any
such defaultes and offenses, contrary to the wealth and proffite of this
realm of England, and the said Godly laws and Acts of Parliament, done and
committed by any person, whosoever he or they be, to insinuate and give
informacion of the offense, to the kings Majesty's Commissioners, who be
appointed to here the same, so truly and faithfully, that neither for favor
nor fear, they omit to tell the truth of any, nor for displeasure name any
man, who is not guilty thereof: That a convenient and spedie reformacion, might
be made herein, to the honor of God, and the kings Majesty, and the wealth
and benefit of the whole realm.

God save the King.
