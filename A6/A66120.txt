Whereas We are extremely desirous that the Trade, Navigation and Naval
Strength of this Our Realm of England (whereupon the Safety and Flourishing
State thereof does so much depend) should by all Proper Means be Promoted and
Advanced. And whereas We are persuaded that nothing will more effectually
Contribute thereto, then the Endeavoring, by due and fitting Encouragements,
to increase the Number of English Seamen, as well for the Strengthening of Our
Navy Royal, and better Performing the Naval Services of Us, Our Heirs and
Successors, as for the Supplying and Carrying on the Occasions and Business of
Our Merchants, and other Our Loving Subjects, Interested in Trade, Commerce,
Fishing, Plantation, Discovery, and other Affairs relating to Navigation. And
whereas the Sea-fairing Men of this Kingdom, have for a long time Distinguished
themselves throughout the World by their Industry and Skilfulness in their
proper Employments, and by their Courage and Constancy, manifested in
Engagements and Hazards, for the Defense and Honor of their Native Country;
and nothing is more likely to continue this their Ancient Reputation, and to
invite greater Numbers of Our Subjects to betake themselves to the Sea, than
the making some Competent Provision, That Seamen, who by Age, Wounds or other
Accidents, shall become Disabled for further Service at Sea, and shall not be
in a Condition to maintain themselves Comfortably, may not fall under Hardships
and Miseries, but may be Supported at the Public Charge: And that the Children
of such Disabled Seamen, and also the Widows and Children of such Seamen as
shall happen to be Slain in Sea-Service, may in some Reasonable Manner be
Provided for and Educated. And whereas having frequently Reflected upon the
Premises since Our Accession to the Crown, We have Determined with Our Selves,
to Erect and Establish a Hospital for the Purposes aforesaid. And although by
reason of the Expensive War in which We have been, and are at present Engaged,
We have not been able to Carry on the said Good and Pious Purposes, to such
Effect as We have desired: Yet in order to begin to put the same in Execution,
We and Our late most Dear Consort the Queen, did by Our Letters Patents under
Our Great Seal of England, bearing Date the Twenty fifth of October last past,
Give and Grant unto you the said Sir John Summers, Thomas Duke of Leeds, Thomas
Earl of Pembrook and Montgomery, Charles Duke of Shrewsbury, Sidney Lord
Godolphin, Sir John Trenchard, Edward Russell, Sir Stephen Fox, Sir John
Louther of Whithaven, Sir William Ashhurst, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Patience
Ward, Sir John Moor, and Sir William Pritchard, and to your Heirs and Assigns
for ever, all that Piece or Parcel of Ground, Situate, Lying and Being within
the Parish of East-Greenwich, in Our County of Kent, and being Parcel, or
reputed Parcel of Our Manor of East-Greenwich aforesaid, containing in the
whole by Admeasurement, Eight Acres, Two Roods, and Thirty two Square Perches,
be the same more or less, as the said Ground is now Marked, Staked or otherwise
Set out, in which Admeasurement, the Ground is Signed for a Way or Passage to
lead through the Premises, and therein mentioned to be excepted, is
comprehended and reckoned, which said Piece or Parcel of Ground is Butted and
Bounded, as in the said Letters Patents is expressed; And all that Capital
Message lately built or in building by Our Royal Uncle King Charles the
Second, and still remaining unfinished, commonly called by the Name of Our
Palace at Greenwich, standing upon the Piece or Parcel of Ground aforesaid,
and several other Edifices and Buildings, and other things in the said Letters
Patents mentioned, except as therein is excepted; To the intent nevertheless
that the aforesaid Premises, and every part thereof, shall be Converted and
Employed unto and for the Use and Service of Our Hospital for the Relief of
Seamen, their Widows and Children, and Encouragement of Navigation in such
manner as is therein expressed, and as by the Letters Patents aforesaid,
(relation being thereunto had) may more fully appear. And as We are fully
Satisfied, that the Execting of such an Hospital, as aforesaid, will be of
Great Benefit and Advantage to this Our Kingdom; so also taking into Our Royal
Consideration, that the Constituting and Establishing a Foundation of that
Nature, and the Framing of Rules and Statutes for the Government thereof, in
