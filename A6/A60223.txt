THE REASONS OF THE CONVERSION OF Mr. John Sidway, FROM The Romish to the
Protestant Religion.

Together with what usage he has since received in the Church of England.

As also a brief Account of his Travails, Humbly Communicated to the High Court
of PARLIAMENT.

LONDON, Printed for Nevil Simmons, at the Three Golden Cocks, at the West end
of St. Paul's, and Langley Curtis on Ludgate Hill. 1681.

TO THE HIGH COURT OF PARLIAMENT.
JOHN SIDWAY wishes Grace, Mercy and Peace, through Jesus Christ.
GReat and manifold were the Blessings (most Noble and Magnificent Assembly)
which Almighty God, the Father of all Mercies, bestowed upon the People of
England, when your most Wise and Honorable Ancestors, by a most impartial and
happy Reformation, expelled from the Church those Thick and Palpable Clouds of
darkness, that for many years had overshadowed this Land, And as it yet gives
unto all that are well affected an exceeding great cause of comfort, so the
fruit thereof does extend it self, not only to the time spent in this
Transitory World, but to our safe conduct to that Eternal Happiness which is
above in Heaven. The occasions (most August Assembly) of my relinquishing the
Romish way of Worship, were the many exceeding gross Errors, and most wicked
Practices, which I found I must necessarily be daily guilty of, continuing
therein. And the Motives that enduced me to embrace the Reformed Religion, and
be Reconciled to Protestancy, were the most Sacred Scriptures, and Ancient
Fathers, unto whom I found the same agreeable, both which, having here
exhibited, I humbly Present to your High Court; Humbly craving (since things of
this Nature, have ever been Subject to the censures of ill meaning, and
discontented persons) the same may receive Approbation and Patronage from so
Learned and Judicious an Assembly, as your High Court is; That so (although I
am exposed hereby, on the one side, to the undeserved Calumniations of the
Popish party, who strive to keep the World in ignorance and darkness; and, on
the other side, to the Foolish Malignity of self-conceited Brethren, who like
of nothing but what is done by themselves, or at leastwise framed after their
own fancy) I may rest secure; supported within, by the Truth and Innocence of a
good Conscience (having walked in the ways of Simplicity and Integrity, as
before the Lord) and sustained without, by the Powerful Protection of your most
August Assemblies, Grace and Favor (which no doubt will ever give Countenance
to honest and Christian endeavors) against bitter Censures, and Uncharitable
Imputations.

The Lord of Heaven and Earth grant to this our Nation, that by your wise
endeavors, Popery may be utterly Extirpated, and Protestancy firmly
established to all generations: So that Peace and Happiness, Truth and Justice,
Religion and Piety, may ever flourish.

THE Printers Epistle TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader.
SInce he that is Cured of a most dangerous Distemper, may do very good service
in Relating to others the means of his Recovery; The Author has here exhibited
to thy most Candid View, and Serious Consideration, what (as may hereby easily
be gathered) with very great Cost, hard and diligent Study, long and tedious
Travel, and most eminent Danger, he was several years in coming to the
knowledge of. The Book (thou will find) although but little, is of very great
and universal use. For (the Grace of God cooperating therewith) art thou a
Heathen, Jew, Turk, or Infidel, it will bring thee to the Faith of Christ; art
thou a Christian, it will greatly confirm thee in thy Sacred Faith, and
exceedingly encourage thee in thy Religious Practice. More particularly, art
thou a Papist, it will cause thee to Relinquish thy Errors, Idolatries,
Blasphemies, and Superstitions, and to adhere to the most Catholic Faith, and
most pure Practice of the Ancient times. Art thou a Protestant, it will greatly
fortify and strengthen thee, in thy most Renowned Primitive Christian Faith,
and Orthodox Profession. In fine, whatsoever thou art, it will bring thee to
embrace the Commands of God, and to avoid the Darts of the Devil; if thou
reapest the benefit thereby intended, give God the Glory.

Vale.
WHereas there is joy in the Presence of the Angels over a Sinner Converted,
and that we are Commanded to let our Light so shine before Men, as that they
may see our good Works, and Glorify our father which is in Heaven; I have here
showed to the World, the Reasons of my Conversion, from the Romish to the
English Church. I was Born at Dublin in Ireland but of an English Extract, was
Educated in a Jesuits College at Bologna in Italy, where I remained until I
had not only Commenced Master of Arts, but was by standing Bachelor of
Divinity. At my first coming to Bologna several Protestants often told me, that
the Roman Religion was not good, and greatly indeavored to persuade me from it,
but perceiving their design herein was to bring me to their own, I desired to
know of them, whether the Protestant Religion were Catholic, had Antiquity,
Succession of Chairs, Perpetual continuance, wrought Miracles, and had the
greatest number of Christians: (which I looked upon, being so instructed, to be
the Marks of the true Church,) but they being not able to show it to be thus in
the Romish sense, I was so obstinate against Protestancy, that I gave them such
a repulse they never after troubled me.

The Jesuits, in the next place, after I had been a while there, set upon me to
enter into their order, and did so assault me with such allurements and
persuasions in order thereunto, that I was so straightened to overcome their
Temptations, that many a time I have spent all the time allotted for
recreation, in Prayer to Almighty God, that of his great mercy he would give me
his assistance to defend me from them. And as often as they tempted me
thereunto, I told them, what I might have hereafter I knew not, but as yet I
had no inclination to enter into a Religious order; but if I had ever such an
inclination, I would sooner enter into their order, then any other. And with
this they seemed to be well satisfied, nevertheless it was but a mere put off,
for I did not at all approve their ways.

When I came to study Divinity, reading the Fathers, I often in the same
observed diverse passages, which in my opinion, made as exceedingly against both
the Faith and Practice of the Church of Rome, as might be, which whether they
do or no, let the World Judge. I have quoted them exactly as they are in their
works, making.

First, against Purgatory and Limbus Infantium.
THe just are called to refreshment, Cyprian in his Book of Mortality, Sect. 11,
and the unjust are snatched away to Punishment: there is presently given
rewards to the Faithful, and Punishments to the Wicked.

The Faith of the Catholics by Divine Authority believes the first place to
be the Kingdom of Heaven, Augustine in his 7th Tomb, and 5th Book Hipognosticon
against the Pelagians p. 957.
from whence, as I have said, is excepted he which is not Baptized, the second
to be Hell; where every Apostate or Stranger from the Faith of Christ shall
undergo Eternal Punishments. The third place we are utterly ignorant of, nor do
we find it in the Holy Scriptures. Feign thou Pelagian 4. place out of the
Warehouse of thy Opinion.

Know for certain, Augustine in his Book of the Vanity of the World, Tomb 9th
Chap. 1.
that when the Soul is departed from the Body, it is either presently placed in
Paradise for its good works, or certainly is cast headlong into the Pit of Hell
for its Sins. Choose you now what you will have, and dispose of this now in
your lifetime, either Perpetually to rejoice with the Saints, or without end
to be Punished with the Wicked,

Let no Man deceive himself, Augustine in his 10th Tomb of time Sermon. 202.

Augustine also says the same in Effect, in his 7th. Tomb and first Book of
the Deserts and Remission of Sins, Chap. 28. And in his fifth Tomb and Twenty
first Book of the City of God, Chap. 25.


my Brethren, there are but two places, and a third there is not for any, he
which deserves not to Reign with Christ, without all douht shall Perish with
the Devil.

2ly. Against the Invocation of Angels and Saints departed, and the making of
them our Mediators and Intercessors.
FOr it behooves not the Church of God to leave off, The Council of Luodicea,
can. 35.
and be gone, and nominate Angels, and make Congregations which are known to be
forbidden; if any one therefore shall be found observing this Occult Idolatry,
let him be accursed, because he leaves our Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God,
Theodoret upon the third Chapter of the Epistle to the Coloss^^s.
and delivers himself up to Idolatry.

For whereas they did command to adore Angels, he commanded the contrary, that
both words and deeds might adorn the remembrance of Christ the Lord: and says
through the sending forth of the Action of thanksgiving to God and the Father,
Clement Pope and Martyr in his second Book of Apostolical constitutions c. 32.
by him, and not by Angels. Following also this Law of the Laodicean Council,
and willing to be cured of that old Disease, read, it is to be taken heed least
they should pray to Augels, and least they should leave Our Lord Jesus Christ.

It is not lawful to come to Almighty God, unless by Christ.

And whereas notwithstanding he says to us, Origin in his Bighth Book against
Cels^^.
there is one God the Father of whom are all things, he says to us this word
of himself, and to all which would ascend to the most High God of Gods, and to
the most High Lord of Lords, but he ascends to the most High God, which
inseparably and indivisibly Worshippeth him, by Jesus the Son of God; by whose
only conduct he comes to the Father.

He has said, Cyril in his Eleventh Book upon John. c. 7.
impelling them to ask with confidence, affirming Amen, Amen, whatsoever you
shall obtain by request from the Father, you shall ask it in my name, and has
added in my name to the end he may show himself a Mediator, for no Man comes
to the Father, unless by the Son. Athanasius also in his Fourth Oration against
the Arians, treating upon the words of Paul to the Thessalonians, page 259. And
Augustine in his Eighth Tomb, in his Enarration of the ^undred and Eighth
Psalm, say plainly the like things.


3ly. Against one Man's works being applied to another.
FOr the foolish Virgins, Hilary in his Commentary upon Matthew, Cannon. 27.
their Lamps being out, cannot go forth to meet him. They which were Wise were
Prayed that they would lend them Oil; to whom they answered we cannot lend our
selves, because there is not perhaps that there may be enough for every one. So
that works and deserts done by others shall help no Man, because it is
necessary that every one buy Oil for his own Lamp. Leo the Great in his 81
Epistle, which is to the Palestine Monks, in the first Tomb of the Councels,
page 791. And Leo the Pope in his 95 Epistle written to Leo Augustus, do plainly
also say the like.


Fourthly. Against the Adoration of Angels, Martyrs, and Saints departed.
LEt Mary be had in honor, Epiphanius in his third Book, Haeres. 79.
and the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost be Adored: Mary no Body Adoreth. I
say not that either Woman or Man, neither do the Angels receive such
glorification, this Mystery is due to God. The things which were ill writ in
the Heart of the deceiver are blotted out. The desire of the Tree is taken from
the Eyes, it is turned again a fiction to the Lord. Eve returned with Adam,
that she might Worship God only; not that she might be led away by the voice of
the Serpent, but might remain in the Precept of God, thou shall not Eat of the
Tree; and it was a Tree, not error, but by him the Tree was made inobedience of
Error. Let not any one Eat of the Error, which is for St. Mary's sake, for
although the Tree was fair, but yet not for Food; so Mary is very fair, and
holy, and honorable; but not for Adoration. These truly do again renew the
mixture of Fortune and prepare a Table for the Devil and not for God, as it is
written, and they are fed with the food of impiety, and as the holy Scripture
says, and the Women do bear fine Flower, and their Children gather Wood, to
make Cakes with Oil subdued to the Army of Heaven. Such Women are repressed by
Jeremiah that they may not trouble the World; and lest they should say, let us
honor the Queen of Heaven. Cyril of Alexandria in his Third Tomb and Sixth Book
against Julian fol. 50 in the Letter A.
Taphnas also knew to Punish these; the places of these Edifices have known to
receive Bodies to Corruption.

But we say the Holy Martyrs be neither Gods, nor have we been wont to Adore
them: But we Praise them with reat Honors that they have striven valiantly for
the truth, and have observed the sincerity of Faith, so that they despised
their lives, and their farewell sayings prevailed in the greatest Perils by the
Terrors of Death; and were of such fortitude, as to stir up to themselves
Statues of their life.

I do not say that we may not Worship and Adore the relics of Martyrs, Hierom
in his second Tomb in his Epistle against Vigilanti^^ for the repair of the
Priests. p. 119.
but also that we may not Worship and Adore the Sun and Moon, not Angels, not
Archangels, not Cherubin, not Seraphin, nor any name which is named both in
this World and in the World to come, for we may not serve Creatures rather than
the Creator, which is Blessed in the World.

The Worship of dead Men is not a Religion for us, Augustine in his first Tomb
in his Book of the true Religion, chap. 55.
if they have lived God^ily, they have no such property as to seek such honors;
but they will worship him, by whose illumination their deserts are Praised by
us that we be their Fellow Servants, therefore they are to be honored for
imitations sake, not for Religions sake, but if they have lived all,
wheresoever they are, they are not so to be honored. Augustine also in his
first Tomb, in his Book of the Manners of the Catholic Church chap. 30. Cyril
of Alexandria in his second Book of Treasure, in his first chapter against
Eunomius; Ambros in his first Book of Faith to Gratianus Augustus, chap. 7. and
many others, do say the like.


Fifthly. Against the Adoration of Images.
IT pleases, The Council of Eliber celebrated in the time of Constantine the
great. Can. 36. Tertullian in his Book of the Crown of a Warrier, c. 10.
that Pictures ought not to be in the Church, nor that any thing should be
Painted upon the Walls, least the same should be Worshipped and Adored.

John the less has said, keep you from Idols; not now from Idolatry, as from a
duty; but from Idols: that is, from the very Effigies of them, for it is an
unworthy thing that there should be an Image of the Living God, an Image of an
Idol and dead thing there may be.

It is not to be doubted, Lactantius in his second Book of Divine Institutions
c. 19.
but there is no Religion, where there is an Image, for if Religion be of
Divine things, there is nothing Divine unless in Celestial things. Images
therefore want Religion, because that nothing Celestial can be in that thing,
which is made of the Earth; which truly may appear to a Wiseman by the very
name, for whatsoever is feigned, must needs be false; neither may that ever
receive the name of a true thing, which feigneth the truth like a Drone, and
for imitation, but if there be any imitation, it is not chiefly a serious
thing, but is as it were a Play and a Jest. Religion is not in Images, but in
Images is the least of Religion. The true one therefore is to be preferred
before the false, and we must tread under foot Earthly things, that we may
follow Heavenly.

Take heed to your selves, that you observe the Traditions which you have
received, Epiphanius Cyprius, as he is Cited by Gregory Neocaesariensi in the
sixth action of the second Nicen Council
that you do not decline either to the right hand, or to the left; for the
doing of which bear away these things: Be you mindful, my beloved Children,
that you do not carry Images into the Church, nor set them in the Burial places
of the Saints, but perpetually carry about you God in your Hearts. Moreover do
not suffer them in your common house, for it is not a Christian right to he
held suspended by the Eyes, but by the Cogitation of the Mind.

God forbids an Idol as well to be made, as to be worshipped, and by how
much it goes before, that it may be that which may be worshipped; Tertullian
in his Book of Idolatry, chapter 4.
by so much it is before, that it may not be, if it be not lawful to be
worshipped. For this cause, the Divine Law Proclaims the very matter, to wit,
of Idolatry to be rooted out, you shall not make (says the same) an Idol
adjoining, neither the likeness of them which are in Heaven, and which are in
Earth, and which are in the Sea: and strictly forbids the Servants of God,
the Arts of this sort throughout the whole world. Enoch also had gone before
foretelling this, that all the Elements, and every Sense of the World, which
are contained in Heaven, which are contained in the Sea, and which are
contained in the Earth, should be turned Devils unto Idolatry; and that the
Spirits of Desert Angels should be Consecrated for God against the Lord. Every
thing therefore that a humane worshippeth besides him, who is the Maker and
Creator of all things, is an error; their Images are Idols, and the
Consecration of Images is Idolatry, whatsoever a worshipper of Images
commits, without doubt it shall be deputed to whatsoever Artificer and of
whatsoever Idol. Lastly, the said Enoch precondemneth in Commination, both the
makers and worshippers of an Idol.

I swear to you Sinners, Tertullian again in the same place.
that in the day of the Blood of Perdition, there is prepared a Penance for
you, you which serve stones, and which make Golden, Silver, Wooden and Stony
Images, and Fictils, and serve Phantasmes, and Devils, and infamous Spirits,
and every error not according to knowledge, shall find no help from them.
Isaiah truly says, be you witnesses if there be a God besides me. And there
were not then, which do counterfeit and carve out every vain thing which they
make at their pleasure, which cannot profit them. And afterward that whole
saying detesteth as well against the makers as the worshippers, whose clause it
is: Know you that the heart of them is Ashes, and they err, and not one of
them can deliver his own Soul. When David also says the like, and such are
they become which make them, but what do I a Man of a mean Memory show beyond
what I can reckon up, or what I can recollect of the Scriptures, as though a
word of the Holy Ghost may not be sufficient, or beyond what may be
deliberated, whether the Lord will Curse and Condemn them, in the first place
the makers of them, the Worshippers of whom he Curses and Condemns. Justin
Martyr in his Dialogue with Tryphon a Jew. page 251. Clement of Alexandria in
his Oration adhortory to the Gentiles, page 25. of the Latin florentine Edition.
Tertullian in his Scorpiaco against the Gnostics, chap. 2. And many others
also say the like.


6ly. Against the Adoration of Holy Relics. Hierome in the Epistle to
Riparius against Vigilantius, in his second Tomb folio 119. and following.
Vigilantius called by Hierome a Holy Priest in his 1st Tomb in the Epistle to
Paulinus, follo 106. which also Caesar Baronius confesses A^: Eccl. Tomb 5. in
the year of our Lord 406. thus writes as it is quoted by Hierome himself in
the second Tomb, in his Epistle against vigilantius, fol. 123.

I do not say that we may not Worship and Adore the Relics of Martyrs, but
also that we may not Worship and Adore the Sun and Moon, not Angels, not
Archangels, not Cherubim, not Seraphim, nor any Name which is Named both in
this World and the World to come, for we may not serve Creatures rather than
the Creator, which is Blessed in the World.

What need is there, that thou with so much honor, not only do Honor, but
also Adore, that which is I know not what, which bearing about in a little
Vessel thou Worshippest? in the same Book also.
What Dust enclosed in Linen, Adoring do thou Kiss? And afterward.
We seem near to the custom of the Gentiles to introduce in the Churches under
the pretense of Religion, the Sun as yet Shining, whole heaps of waxen things
to be lighted: and wheresoever there is I know not what dust, in a little
precious Vessel enclosed in Linen, the Kissers thereof do Adore it. Men show
great Honor of this sort to the Blessed Martyrs, whom they think to be
illustrated by the most vile waxen lights: and whom the Lamb, which is in the
midst of the Throne, with every ray of his Majesty illustrateth. The Council of
Eliber also; celebrated in the time of Constantine the Great, in its 34 and 35
Cannon says the like.


7ly. Against Transubstantiation, and by Consequence, the Adoration of the Host.
THe Lord, Theodoret in his second Epistle, Dialog. first.
when he had taken the Symbal or Sign, said not, this is my Deity, but this is
my Body.

He gave to his Disciples the Image, Procopius Gazeus, upon the 49 Chapter of
the Book of G.
Effigies, or Tipe of his Body, admitting, as thou may gather, not any thing
further of raw and bloody Sacrifices.

Bread being taken and distributed to the Disciples, he made it his Body,
Tertullian in his Fourth Book against Marcione, c. 19
saying this is my Body, that is, the Figure of my Body. And it could not have
been a Figure, unless the Body were of verity, for it is an empty thing, which
is a Phantasme, that cannot take a Figure.

The Priest says; Ambrose in his fourth Book of the Sacraments, chap. 5.
make this oblation ascribed to us, rational and acceptable, which is the
Figure of the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.

The Lord admitted Judas to the Banquet in which he commended and delivered to
his Disciples the Figure of his Body and Blood. Augustine upon the third Psalm.


Look into the same diligently, Ephrem Syrus to them which will search into the
nature of the Son of God. chap. 4.
how taking in his hands the Bread, he Blessed it and Brake it for a Figure of
his Immaculate Body; and the Cup he Blessed and gave to his Disciples for a
Figure of his Precious Blood. Als Charles the Great in his Epistle to Alcuinus
of the Reason of Sept. in his Book of Divine Offices; Bertramus of the Supper
of the Lord; Origines against the Marcionits Diolog. 3. Chrysostom in his
Eighty third Homily upon Matthew; and many others, say in sense the same.


Eighthly, Against the Adoration of the Altar, the Cross, and all manner of
Creatures, whether of Gods Creation, or of Man's Invention.
THE Catholic Church the true Mother of Christians, Augustine in the first
Tome, in his Book of the Manners of the Church Catholic, chapter 30.
does not only deservedly Preach that God himself, whose adoption is a most
blessed life, is most Purely and most Chastely to be Worshipped, but we command
that no Creature to be Adored be brought in, for us to serve the same; and by
that incorrupt and inviolable Eternity, to only whom Man is Subject, and to
only whom the rational Soul in not cohering is miserable: Excluding every thing
that is made, that is obnoxious to change, and is Subject to the time. The like
also affirms Epiphanius in his Second Book against Origin Adamurtius in the
64 Heresy, page 231.


Ninthly, Against Prayer for the Dead.
READ the Scriptures of our Savior, Chrysostom in his twenty Second Homily to
the people of Antioch. Hierome in his Commentaries upon the Sixth Chapter of
the Epistle to the Galatians on these words, every one shall bear his own
burden.
and learn how we wandering hither and thither can help no body, not a Brother
redeemeth a Brother from interminable torments: not a Friend, a Friend; not the
Parents their Children; nor the Children their Parents; but why do I speak of
miserable men, when neither if Noah comes, and Job, and Daniel, then judging
can Pray us out.

Whilst we are in this present world, either by Prayers or Counsels we may be
helpful to our neighbor, but when we shall come before the Tribunal of Christ,
not Job, not Daniel, neither Noah can ask for any one; but every one shall bear
his own burden. The same in sense says also Augustine in his Tenth Tome, in
the thirty Second Sermon of the words of the Apostle.


Tenthly. Against humane merit.
THe forgiveness of Sins is not the merit of Honesty, Hilarie in his Enerration
upon the 66. Psalm near the beginning. Gregory the great Bishop of Rome, in the
ninth Book of his Moral Exposition upon Job, chap. 11. Bernard in his Treatise
of Grace and Free will, not far from the beginning.
but the will of a free indulgence from the riches of goodness, a gift
abounding to pity.

Although I should abound for the work of virtue, I attain to Life, not by
merit but by pardon.

Where therefore, says he, are our merits? or where is our hope? Hear I say,
not by works of Justice which we have done, but according to his mercy he has
saved us. Why therefore do thou resolutely think that thou have created thy
merits, and can be saved by thy own Righteousness, which can not so much as
say the Lord Jesus, unless in the Holy Ghost? have thou indeed forgotten he
which has said, without me you can do nothing? and that it is neither of the
runner, nor of the willer, but of God showing mercy? The same also in effect,
says Hilary in his Sermon upon the 51. Psalm, not far from the end.


Eleventhly. Against Auricular Confession.
I Do not lead thee upon the Stage of thy associates, Chrysostom in his second
Homily upon the 50. Psalm.
I do not compel thee to discover thy Sins to Men: rehearse and unfold thy
Conscience before God. Show to the Lord the most excellent Physician thy
wounds, and ask of him a Medicament. Show them to him who not in the least
reproacheth, but most graciously cures.

What therefore have I to do with Men, Augustine in his first tome and tenth
Book of Confessions chap. 3.
that they should hear my Confessions, and as if they could heal all my griefs?
A curious kind of people to know another life, but slothful to correct their
own life. Why do they inquire of me to hear what I am, who will not that thou
my God do hear what they are? and from whence know they, that although by my
self, they hear from my self; or whether I say true or no, seeing that no one
knows what is done of Men toward Man, unless the Spirit of Man which is in
himself. The same also in effect, says Chrysostom in his 31. Homily upon the
Epistle to the Hebrews, the which is upon the 12. chap. Page 1956. according to
the Commelinian Edition.


Twelfthly. Against Humane Satisfaction.
PEter grieved and wept, Ambrose upon the 22. chap. of Luke.
because he erred as a Man. I find not what he said; I find that he wept; I
read of his Tears, but I read not of his satisfaction. Augustine in his ninth
tome in his second Treatise upon the first Epistle of John.


Sins are forgiven you by his name, and not by the name of any Man, or of any
thing of Man. Cyprian in effect also, says the same in his Sermon of washing
the Feet, in the last Section.


Thirteenthly. Against Pilgrimages.
NOt that we have been at Jerusalem, Hierome in his Epistle to Paulinus about
the Institution of a Monk, tom. 1. fol. 103.
but that we have lived well at Jerusalem is to be praised, that City is to be
wished for, not which has killed the Prophets, and poured forth the Blood of
Christ, but which the violence of a River makes glad, which being Situated
upon a Mountain cannot be hid: which an Apostle proclaims to be the Mother of
the Saints; and in which there is gladness that it self has a freedom with the
Saints. I do not, in saying this, reprove my self of inconstancy, or condemn
what I do, or that I may seem to have left both mine and my Country (after the
Example of Abraham) in vain, but I dare not confine the Omnipotency of God in a
strait corner, and keep it in a little place of the Earth which contains not
Heaven, for each one of the Believers are not profited by the diversities of
places, but by the merit of Faith. And the true Adorers, neither at Jerusalem
nor on Mount Gazarim do Adore the Father; for God is a Spirit, and his Adorers
ought to Adore him in Spirit and in Truth, the Spirit Breaths where it
lists: The Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof. After that the whole
World was watered with Celestial dew, and made dry by the fall of the Jew, many
coming both from the East and the West, sat down in the Bosom of Abraham. It
is to be noted, that God ceased in Judea, and his great Name in Israel; but
into every Nation went forth the sound of the Apostles, and their words unto
the Ends of the Earth. Our Savior speaking to his Disciples when he was in the
Temple: Said arise, let us go hence, and to the Jews your house shall be left
to you desolate, if Heaven and Earth shall pass away, verily all things which
are Earthly shall pass away. Therefore both the Cross and the place of
Resurrection are profitable to those, which bear their Cross; and rise daily
with Christ; and show themselves worthy for such a Habitation. But they which
say, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, let them hear from the
Apostle, you are the Temple of the Lord, and the Holy Ghost inhabiteth in you.
Both at Jerusalem, and at Britain, the Celestial Court is equally open; for the
Kingdom of God is within you. Examine Anthony, and all the Monks of Egypt, of
Mesopotamia, of Pontus, of Capadocia, and of Armenia, and they have not seen
Jerusalem; and it is manifest to them that without this City is the Gate of
Paradise. Blessed Hilarion, when Palestina was, and he lived in Palestina, one
only day saw Jerusalem, that he might seem neither to contemn the Holy Place
for its neerness, nor again enclose the Lord in a Place.

Toward what place, Hierome in the same place, a little afterward;
can thou say, that these things were reiterated from a long beginning;
surely thou do not think that any thing of thy Faith is wanting, because thou
have not seen Jerusalem; neither do we therefore esteem our selves the better,
that enjoy the Habitation of this place; but whether here or elsewhere, thou
have an equal reward by our Lord for thy works. Claudius Taurinensis a Bishop
of the Church against Theodemirus Abbot, concerning Pilgrimage for Religion
sake to the City of Rome, in his fifth Tomb of Orthodox writing referred to
Jonah Bishop of Aurelianensis in the third Book of the Worship of Images, page
1570. Says plainly also the like.


14ly. Against Sacrifice.
HE did not say, Chrysostom upon the first chapter of John, Homil. 17. of the words
of John the Baptist, behold the Lamb of God he which takes away the Sins of
the World.
which shall take away, or has took away; but which takes away the Sins of
the World, that he may be understood daily to take away the same, for not only
when he Suffered did he take away our Sins, but from that time hitherto he
takes them away; he is not always Crucified, for he offered for our Sins one
Sacrifice, but always by that one he Purges us.

He has, indeed, by his Death, that one true Sacrifice offered for us,
Augustine in his third Tomb and fourth Book of the trinity, chapter 13.
purged, abolished, and extinguished, whatsoever there was of faults wherewith
Principalities and Powers did detain us by the Law for to pay Punishments; and
by his Resurrection unto a new life has called us that are predestined, has
justisied us that are called, and has glorified us that are justified.
Augustine also in his Enchiridium to Laurentius, chap. 62. Plainly says the
like.


15ly. Against St. Peter's being the Head of the Apostles, and the Pope's being
the Head of the Church.
THis truly which was Peter, Cyprian the Martyr in his Book of the Unity of the
Church S. 3.
and the other Apostles, were endowed with an Equal consort both of Honor and
Power.

Christ after his Resurrection gave to all his Apostles an equal Power. In the
same a ^ittle before.


Whosoever has desired Primacy on Earth, Chrysostom in his forty third Homily
of imperfect works upon the twenty third Chapter of Matthew.
shall find confusion in Heaven; neither shall he be accounted amongst the
Servants of Christ, that treats of Primacy.

Wheresoever a Bishop shall be, whether at Rome, or at Eugubium, or at
Constantinople, or at Regium, or at Alexandria, or at Tanis, Hierome in his
Epistle to Evagrins.
he is both of the same merit, and of the same Priesthood. The power of Riches,
and humility of Poverty, or loftiness, or inferiority, makes not a Bishop: but
they are all the Successors of the Apostles.

None of the Patriarchs ever used universal in his denomination, Pelagius the
second, Bishop of Rome, in his Epistle to all the Bishops unlawfully called
together by John of Constantinople.
for if any one Patriarch be said to be universal, the name of the rest of the
Patriarchs is diminished. But bet his far from us, let the faithful of
whatsoever kind be far from the mind that any one should snatch or covet to
himself this, from whence it may seem that the honor of their Brothers, (by how
little or small a part soever) is diminished. Wherefore your charity no Man
ever names in his Epistles universal, lest he diminish to himself a debt,
seeing he bestows upon another a honor being not due.

Let that name of Blasphemy be far from the hearts of Christians, Gregory the
Great in his fourth Book of Epistles from the Register, Epist. 32. which is to
Mauricius Augustus.
in which the honor of all the Priests is taken away, whilst it is madly
arrogated by one to himself. Chrysostom upon the first chapter of the Acts of
the Apostles; and Gregory the Great, in the fourth Book of the Epistles from
the Register, Epistle 34. which is to Constantia Augusta, do clearly also say
the like.


16ly. Against the Roman Churches infallibility.
AFter so many benefits they turned the Privileges of Dignity into contempt,
Hierom upon the second c. of Jeremy, thus inveheth against the Priests of Rome.
insomuch as the Priests of the Lord were idle, so that the Doctors of the Law
were ignorant of him, which they ought to have taught to others, and the
Pastors through negligence became deceivers, and the Prophets which disputed
among the People, did not speak to God, but an Idol; and Worshipped their own
fiction. And we might use these words against the Masters of our Order, which
devour the People of God, Hierom concerning the seven Orders of the Church, c.
5. as it is cited in the Cannon Law distinct. 93. in the chap. of a Deacon
which in order is the 23.
etc.

And now by whom in the Churches, as in the Roman Empire, Covetousness has
increased, the Law of the Priest and the Vision of the Prophet has Perished.
Every one truly by the Power of an Episcopal name, which they maintain to
themselves unlawfully without the Church, do bring back by force unto their own
uses, all which is of the Levites; neither do they maintain to themselves that
which is written, but take away the whole from all.

At that same time in the City of Rome, Eusebius in his fifth Book of his
Ecclesiastic History, chap. 20.
they were greatly disturbed with diverse novelties by the many Ecclesiastic
rules of Tradition. Hierom also to Evagrius the Bishop in the 85 Epistle, in
the second Tome, and as it is cited in the Cannon Law, in the same distinction
abovesaid, in the Chapter that is in order the Twenty fourth, plainly says the
like.


17ly. Against Papal Dispensations.
THat is not able to stand, Gratianus upon the Rubric. chap. 8.
which is done against the Evangelical or Prophetical Doctrine or Constitution.

Neither shall any thing stand, Pope Marcellinus in his second Epistle.
although it has been acted by the Holy Fathers, that is constituted against
the Evangelical or Prophetical, or Apostolical Doctrine.

It is not in the Power of the Pope, Gerson of the Spiritual life of the Soul.
or of a Council, or of the Church, to change the traditions given by the
Evangelists and by Paul, as certain Persons dote. Urbanus the Pope, as he is
cited in the Cannon Law, in the Twenty fifth cause, plainly also says the like.


18ly. Against Multitude of Ceremonies.
THis, Hierome in his commentaries upon the 23d. Chap. of Mat. Peter de Aliacp.
Cardinal, Chamberlain of the Reformation, concerning the reformation of the
Church and Prelates.
even to this very day with us, both at the little Gospels, and to the word of
the Cross, and to things of this sort, do the Superstitious Women practice; who
have indeed a zeal of God but not according to knowledge; straining at a Gnat,
and swallowing a Camel.

It were to be taken care of, that in Divine Service there were not such a
burdensome length, but that there should be observed a wished and innocent
brevity. John Gerson also in the third part of the works of the Spiritual life
of the Soul, in the second Lesson, plainly says the like.


19ly. Against an Obligation to a Single life, either in Priest's, or others.
ANdrightly has (Paul) put that, Theodoret up on the fourth chapter of the
first Epistle to Timothy.
forbidding to Marry; for he does not dispraise continency and a single life,
but accuses them which by a made Law do compel to follow the same.

Integrity of the Body is to be wished by you; Ambrose in his Book of
Exhortation to Virginity, as it is cited in the Cannon Law, cause. 32. Qu. 2. in
the c. concerning integrity, which is in number the thirteenth. The fifth
Cannon of the Apostles.
which I for counsel persuade, nor for Empire command, for Virginity is alone,
which may be persuaded, but not commanded; a thing rather to be wished then to
be enjoined.

A Bishop, or a Priest, or Deacon shall not under the pretense of Religion put
away his proper Wife, and if he reject her let him be Excommunicated, but if he
so persevere, let him be cast out.

That in his time very many Priests were Married, Hierome in his first Tome of
Epistles, and first Book against Jovinian, page 33. testifies.
and that a Bishop is described by the Apostle to be the Husband of one Wife,
having his Children with all Chastity.

It is neither proved by reason or Authority, that absolutely speaking, a
Priest can sin by being Married; Cardinal Cajetan in opuse. Tit. 1. Tract. 27
And in the same place a little after he concludes.
neither is an order, in as much as it is an order; nor an order in as much as
it is holy an impediment to Matrimony.

The Priesthood not to break off the contract of Matrimony, whether it be
before or after Ordination, is secluded by all Laws, standing only in those
which we have from Christ and his Apostles. Clement, a Roman, the Disciple of
Peter the Apostle, and (as the Papists will have it) his Successor in the Roman
Bishopric, in his second Book of Apostolical constitutions, chap. 2.
describing of what sort a Bishop ought to be, plainly also says the like.


20ly. That the Holy Scriptures are the only Rule both of our Faith and Actions.
GOd Gave a Law to us, Hierom upon the 8. chapter of Isaiah v. 20.
and the Testimonies of the Scriptures; which if you will not follow, you will
not have light, but darkness will always oppress you.

As the night extinguisheth not the Stars of Heaven: Pope Zepherinus in his
first Epistle to the Bishops of Sicilia, as it is cited in the Cannon Law,
Distinct 38. in the chapter Sicut, which is in order the Eighth.
So Worldly iniquity obscureth not the Minds of the Faithful, adhering to the
Firmament of the Holy Scripture.

The Gentile says, Chrysostom upon the Acts of the Apostles, Homil 33.
I would be a Christian, but I know not to what to adhere, many quarrels are
among you, I know not what Opinion I may choose. Every one says, I say true; I
know not who I may believe, seeing that on all sides they pretend Scriptures. I
answer them; this makes greatly for us. For if we ought to say that we believe
reasons, thou art deservedly troubled: But seeing we receive the Scriptures,
and that they are both simple and true, it will be casie for thee to Judge If
any one consents to these, he is a Christian; if any one be against them, he
is far from this Cannon.

There is not any other left for the Speeches of Men concerning the things of
God, Hilary in his seventh Book of the Trinity, page 125.
saving only the Word of God.

It behooves us to confirm every word or thing by a Testimony of the Holy
Scripture, Basil the great in his twenty Sixth Principal of Morals, chap. 1.
both for the certainty and perfection of good, and confusion of evil.

The Scripture Divinely inspired is constituted an Arbitrator for us, Basil the
great in his Book of Epistles, Epist, 80. which is to Eustathius the Physician.
p. 714. according to the Frobenian Edition Printed in the year 1566.
and by whom there shall be found agreeable Edicts in Divine words, even to
these and no more approaches a Suffrage of verity. Augustine in the Seventh
Tome, in his Book of the unity of the Church, c. 16. plainly also says the
like.


21ly. That the Scriptures contain whatsoever Doctrine is necessary to
Salvation.
THe Gospel contains all things both for the present and the future,
Chrysostom upon the Epistle to Titus, Homil. 1.
and in a word has wrapped therein honor and Piety, and Faith, and also every
thing of Preaching.

Not all things which God did, Cyril of Alexandria in his twelfth Book upon
John chap. the last.
are written; but those which are written as well for Manners as Belief are
Judged to suffice, that by a right faith and Works we may come Shining to the
Kingdom of Heaven by Jesus Christ.

For all the Scripture, Cardinal Hugo of St. Charo ia Postilla upon 2. Tim. 3.
that is the Holy Scripture which is concerning all things necessary to
Salvation, and which is all the whole, that is, Perfect, and therefore
priviledgeth the Name of Scripture to it self by putting one Name for another.

The Speech is of the Sacred Letters of the old Testament, Cardinal Cajetan
upon 2. Tim. 3.
which can instruct and teach thee, as touching wisdom, unto Salvation by
Faith; for they have the faculty of teaching the Wisdom, not of this World, but
unto Eternal Salvation, etc. Also being perfect as touching the whole, and
consisting of all things requisite unto the perfecting of the Man of God.

Whereas the Lord Jesus has done many things, Augustine in his ninth tome, and
forty ninth Treatise upon John.
not all have been written; but they are choice ones which were written, which
seemed to suffice Believers to Salvation. Tertullian in his twenty second
Chapter against Hermogenes, and in his Book of the Flesh of Christ, chap. 7.
plainly also says the like.


22. That God only ought to be Adored and Invocated.
ONly God, Origin in his eighth Book against Celsus.
who is the best and greatest, is to be Adored; and Prayers are to be offered
by the only begotten Word of God alone.

To God alone by Jesus offer Prayers. And in the same a little afterward.


For we have learned to Adore only him, Eusebius in his fourth Book of
Evangelical preparation chap. 5.
who is the God and Creator of all things.

Neither do we read that any thing is to be Adored besides God, Ambrose in his
third Book of the holy Ghost chap. 12.
for it is written, thou shall Adore the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou
serve.

But nevertheless thou O Lord art only to be Adored, Ambrose in his prayer at
the departure of Theodosius, Fol. 137. in the letter 6.
thou only art to be asked, that he ( Theodosius the Great, Emperor) may be
with his Sons brought in thy presence.

He truly conserveth verity, Cyril of Alexandria in his twelfth Book of
Treasure, chap. 1.
which contrarily, not the Creature, but the Creator worshippeth, and him only
Serves. Dionysius Alexandrium as he is reheatsed by Eusebius in his seventh
Book of the History of the Church, chap. 10. And Augustine in the first tome of
his Book of the true Religion, chap. 55. plainly also say the like.


23. That the Pope is Antichrist.
WHat is this, Arnulph Bishop of Orleans in a Council Assembled at Rhemes under
the King the Head, in which Arnulph was appointed Archbishop of Rhemes,
speaks thus of the Bishop of Rome. This Speech also the Council never
contradicted, but then judged according to the opinion of Arnulph of Orleans,
as it is recited in the tenth Century of the History of Magdeburge, Printed at
Basil.
Most Reverend Fathers, what is this Man Sitting in a lofty Throne, shining
with Gold and a Purple Vestment, what, I say, do you believe that this Man is?
It is no wonder if he be destitute of the Love of God, and be proud with the
only Wisdom also taken from him, for he is Antichrist, sitting in the Temple
of Cod, and showing himself that he is God.

I being compelled to Rome have provoked the Roman Bishop, Otto Duke of
Bavaria, in his Speech to the Bishops, as it is received by Aventine, in his
seventh Book of the Annals of Bris, page 550.
and by the Direction of Gregory the Great Pope have defended mine by Arms.
This Man being dead, you had Preached that the Roman Bishop is Antichrist: And
I have fell from the forsaken Sect of the Chief Priest, to the Emperor, etc.

Eva cum Adam, ut Deum colat solum; ne ducatur serpentis, voce, sed permaneat in
Dei praecepto, ne comedas de ligno; and erat lignum, non error, fed per ipsum
lignum facta est inobedientia erroris: Ne comedat quis de errore, qui est
propter sanctam Mariam. Nam etsi pulchrum est lignum, sed tamen non ad cibum.
Etsi Pulcherrima est Maria, and Sancta and honorata; at non ad Adorationem. Hae
vero rursus renovant sortunae mixturam and praeparant Diabolo and non Deo
mensam, velut scriptum est, and pascuntur cibo impietatis, velut dicit divina
scriptura, and soeminae ferunt Pollinem, and filii colligunt ligna, ut faciant
placentas oleo subactas exercitui Coeli, compescantur a Jeremia tales Mulieres
and ne turbent orbem Terrarum: Ne dicant, honoramus Reginam Coeli. Novit enim

Non est dubium, quin religio nulla sit, ubicunque simulacrum est, nam si
religio ex divinis rebus est, divini autem nihil est, Lactantius divinarum

nisi in caelestibus rebus: carent ergo religione simulacre: quia nihil potest
esse caeleste in ea re, quae fit ex terra: quod quidem de nomine ipso sapienti
apparere potest. Quicquid enim simulatur, id falsum sit, necesse est: nec
potest unquam very nomen accipere, quod veritatem fuco, and imitatione
mentitur. Si autem omnis imitatio, non res potissimum seria sed quasi ludus ac
jocus est: non religio in simulacris, sed minus religionis est. Praeferendum
est igitur verum omnibus falsis, calcanda terrena ut Caelestia consequamur.

Attendite vobis, ut servetis traditionis quas accepistis. Epiphanius Cyprius

Enoch, omnia Elementa omnem mundi sensum, quae Coelo, quae Mari, quae Terra
continentur, in Idolatriam versuros daemonas, and Spiritus desertorum
Angelorum, ut pro Deo adversus Dominum consecrarentur. Omnia igitur colit
humanus error, Praeter ipsum omnium conditorem eorum imagines Idola, imaginum
consecratio Idolatria. Quicquid Idololatra committit, in Artificem quemcunque

redimet, ex interminabilibus tormentis: non amicus amicum, non parents filios,
non filii parents. Et quid dico homines miserabiles, cum neque si Noe veniat,
and Job, and Daniel, tunc judicantem exorare possinr.

Dum in praesenti seculo sumus, sive orationibus, Hieronymus Commentariis ad
capursex^um Epistolae ad Galatas ad ea verba, unusquisque onus suum portabit.
sive consiliis invicem posse nos coadjuvari. Cum autem ante tribunal Christi
venerimus, non Job, non Daniel, nec Noe rogare posse pro quoquam: sed
unumquemque portare onus snum. Idem etiam in sensu ait Augustinus decimo tomo,
Sermon trigesimo secundo de verbis Apostoli.


Decimo. Contra Meritum Humanum.
PEccatorum remissio non probitatis est meritum, Hilarens in Enerratione Psalmi
sexagesimi Sexti subinitium.
sed Spontaneae indulgentiae, voluntas ex bonitatis divitiis ad miserandi munus
exuberans.

Etsi ad opus virtutis excrevero, ad vitam non ex meritis, Gregorius Magnus
Episcopus Romanus libro nono Expositionis Moralis in Jobum-capite undecimo.
sed ex venia convalesco.

Ubi ergo, ait, sunt merita nostra, aut ubi est spes nostra? audi inquam, non
ex operibus justitiae quae fecimus nos, sed secundum suam misericordiam salvos
nos fecit. Quid enim? tu forte putaveras tua te creasse merita, Bernardus
tractatu de Gratia and libro arbitrio ab initio ferme.
tua posse salvari justitia, qui nec saltem Dominum Jesum dicere potes nisi in
Spiritu Sancto? itane oblitus es qui dixerit: Sine me nihil potestis facere? Et
neque currentis, neque volentis, sed Dei miserantis est. Idem etiam in effectu
dicit Hilarious in Enerratione Psalmi quinquagesimi primi, non procul a fine.


Undecimo. Contra Confessionem Auricularem.
NOn te in conservorum tuorum theatrum duco, Chrysostomus homilia secunda in
Psalmum quinquagesimum.
non hominibus peccata tua detegere cogo repete coram Deo conscientiam tuam and
explica. Ostende Domino praestantissimo Medico, tua vulnera and pete ab eo
Medicamentum: Ostende ei qui nihil opprobret, sed humanissime curet.

Quid mihi ergo est cum hominibus ut audeant confessiones meas, quasi ipsi
sanaturi sint omnes languores meos? Augustious tomo primo, libro decimo
confessionum, capite tertio.
curiosum genus ad cognoscendam vitam alienam, desidiosum ad corrigendam suam.
Quid a me quaerunt audire qui sim, qui nolunt te (Deus mi) audire qui sint? Et
unde sciunt cum a meipso de meipso audiunt, an verum dicam, quandoquidem nemo
scit hominum quid agatur in homine, nisi Spiritus hominis qui in ipso est.
Chrysostomus etiam in effectu idem dicit homilia trigesima prima in Epistolam
ad hebraeus in caput duodecimum, Pagina Millesima Nongentesima Quinquagesima
Sexta, editionis commelinianae.


Duodecimo. Contra satisfactionem Humanam.
PEtrus doluit and flevit, quia erravit ut homo. Ambrosius super Lucam ad caput
vigesimum se cundum. Augustinus nono tomo, tractatu secundo in primam Epistolam
Johannis.
Non invenio quid dixerit invenio quod fleverit. Lacrymas ejus lego,
satisfactionem non lego.

Dimittuntur vobis Peccata per nomen ejus, non per hominis alicujus. Cyprianus
in effectu etiam dicit idem sermon de ablutione nedum sectione ultima.


Decimo Tertio. Contra Peregrinationes.
NOn Hierosolimis fuisse, sed Hierosolimis is been vixisse, Hieronimus in
Epistola ad Panlinum de institutione Monachi primo tomo, folio centesimo tertio.
laudandum est, illa expetenda est civitas, non quae occidit Prophetas, and
Christi Sanguinem fudit, sed quam fluminis impetus laetificat; quae in monte
sita caelari non potest, quam matrem Sanctorum Apostolus clamitat; in qua se
municipatum cum justis habere laetatur. Neque vero hoc dicens, memet ipsum
inconstantiae redarguo, damnoque quod facio; ut frustra videar ad exemplum
Abraham, and meos and Patriam reliquisse: Sed non audeo Dei Omnipotentiam
augusto fine concludere, and coartare parvo terrae loco, quem non capit Coelum.
Singuli quique credentium, non locorum diversitatibus, sed fidei merito,
ponderantur. Et very Adoratores, neque Hierosolymis neque in Monte Gazarim
Adorant Patrem; quia Deus Spiritus est, and Adoratores ejus in Spiritu and
veritate Adorare oportet. Spiritus spirat ubi vult Domini est Terra and
plenitudo ejus. Postquam siccato judeae vellere, Universus Orbis Caelesti rore
perfusus est, and multi de Orient and occidente venientes, recubuerunt in sinu
Abrahae; desiit notus esse tantum in Judaea Deus, and in Israel magnum nomen
ejus, sed in omnem Terram exivit sonus Apostolorum, and in Finis Orbis Terrae
verba eorum. Salvator ad Discipulos loquens cum esset in Templo: Surgite,
inquit, abeamus hinc, and ad Judaeos: Relinquetur vobis Domus vestra deserta.
Si Coelum and Terra transibunt, utique transibunt omnia quae terrena sunt. Et
crucis igitur and Resurrectionis loca prosunt his, qui portant crucem suam; and
cum Christo resurgunt quotidie, qui dignos se exhibent tanto habitaculo.
Caeterum qui dicunt Templum Domini, Templum Domini, audiant ab Apostolo; vos
estis Templum Domini, and Spiritus Sanctus habitat in vobis. Et de Hierosolymis
and de Britannia aequaliter patet aula Caelestis: Regnum enim Dei intra vos est
Antonius, and cuncta Aegypti and Mesopotamiae, Ponti, Cappadociae, and Armeniae
examina Monachorum, non videre Hierosolymam; and patet illis absque hac Urbe
Paradisi janua. Beatus Hilarion, cum Palaestinus esset, and in Palaestina
viveret, uno tantum die vidit Hierosolymam, ut nec contemnere loca Sancta
propter viciniam, nec rursus Dominum loco claudere videretur.

Quorsum, inquies, haec tam longo repetita Principio? Ibidem Paulo Post.
Videlicet ne quicquam fidei tuae deesse putes, quia Hierosolymam non vidisti;
nec nos idcirco meliores existimes, quod hujus loci habitaculo fruimur: Sed
sive hic sive alibi, aequalem te pro operibus tuis apud Dominum nostrum habere
mercedem. Claudius Taurinensis Ecclesiae Episcopus adversus Theodemirum Abbatem
de Peregrinatione religionis causa in urbem Romam, in quinto tomo
Orthodoxographorum Jona Aurelianensi Episcopo referente libro tertio de cultu
imaginum, pagina millesima quingentesima, septuagesima, simile etiam clare
dicit.


Decimo Quarto. Contra Sacrificium.
NEc dixit, qui tollet aut tulit: sed tollit peccata mundi, Chrysostemus in
caput primum Johannis, homila decima se ptima de verbis Johannis Baptistae,
ecce Agnus ille Dei qui tollit peccata mundi.
ut quotidie ea tollere intelligatur. Non enim cum passus est; solum nostra
abstulit peccata, sed ex illo hactenus tollit. Non semper Crucifigitur; unum
namque pro peccatis nostris tulit Sacrificium, sed semper per illud nos purgat.

Morte sua quippe uno verissimo Sacrificio pro nobis oblato, quicquid culparum
erat unde nos principatus and potestates ad luenda supplicia jure detinebant,
purgavit, abolevit, extinxit, Augustinus tertio tomo, libro quarto de
trinitate, capite decimo tertio.
and sua resurrectione in novam vitam nos praedestinatos vocavit, vocatos
justificavit, justificatos glorificavit. Augustinus etiam in Encbiridio ad
Laurentium, capite Sexagesimo secundo clare simile dicit.


Decimo Quinto. Quod nec Petrus fuerit Apostolorum, nec Papa Ecclesiae, Caput.
HOc erant utique and caeteri Apostoli, quod fuit Petrus, Cyprianus Martyr.
libro de unitate Ecclesia sectione tertia.
Pari consortio praediti and honoris and potestatis.

Christus Apostolis omnibus post Resurrectionem suam parem potestatem tribuit.
Ibidem Paulo ante.


Quicunque desideraverit Primatum in Terra, Chrysostomus homila quadragesima
tertia operis impersecti in Matthaeum ad cap. viges. tertium. Hieronymus in
Epistola ad Evagrium.
inveniet confusionem in Coelo, nec inter servos Christi computabitur, qui de
Primatu tractaverit, etc.

Ubicunque fuerit, Episcopus, sive Romae, sive Eugubii, sive Constantinopoli,
sive Rhegii, sive Alexandriae, sive Tanis, ejusdem meriti, ejusdem est and
sacerdotii. Potentia divitiarum, and paupertatis humilitas, vel sublimiorem vel
inferiorem Episcopum non fuit. Caeterum omnes Apostolorum successores sunt.

Nullus Patriarcharum Universalis vocabulo unquam utatur. Pelagius 2. Episcopus
Romanus Epist. omnibus Episcopis illicite a Johanne Constantinopolitano
convocatis. Gregorius Magnus Epistolarum ex registro libro quarto, Epistola
trigesima secunda quae est ad Mauricium Augustum.
Quia si unus Patriarcha Universalis dicitur, Patriarcharum nomen caeteris
derogatur. Sed absit, hoc, absit a fidelis cujusquam mente, hoc sibi vel velle
quempiam arripere, unde honorem fratrum suorum imminueri ex quantulacunque
part videatur. Quapropter charitas vestra neminem unquam suis in Epistolis
Universalem nominet, ne sibi debitum subtrahat, cum alteri honorem defert
indebitum.

Absit a cordibus Christianorum nomen istud Blasphemiae, in quo omnium
sacerdotum honor adimitur, dum ab uno sibi dementer arrogatur. Chrysostomus in
caput Primum Actorum Apostolicorum, Et Gregorius Magnus quarto libro
Epistolarum ex registro Epistola trigesima quarta quae est ad constantiam
Augustam similia etiam clare dicunt.


Decimo Sexto. Contra infallibilitatem Ecclesiae Romanae.
POst tanta beneficia verterunt in contemptum Privilegia dignitatis, Hieronymus
in caput Secundum Jeremiae, sic invehitur in Sacerdotes Romanos. Hieronymus de
septem ordinibus Ecclesiae, capite quinto, quemadmodum citatur in jure
Canonico, distinctione nonagesima tertia capitolo Diaconi, quod in ordine est
vigesimum tertium. Eusebius Ecclesiasticae historiae quinto libro, capite
vigesimo.
ut Sacerdotes Dominum non quaererent, ut doctores Legis ignorarent eum, qui
alios docere debebant, and Pastores per negligentiam praevaricatores fierent,
and Prophetae qui in Populis disputant, non Deo loquantur, sed Idolo, and sua
figmenta venerentur, his autem verbis utendum est adversus nostri ordinis
Magistros, qui devorant plebem Dei, etc.

Nunc autem ex quo in Ecclesiis, sicut in Romano imperio, crevit avaritia;
periit Lex de Sacerdote and visio de Propheta. Singuli quippe per potentiam
Episcopalis nominis, quam sibi ipse illicite absque Ecclesia vindicarunt, totum
quod Levitarum est, in usus suos redigunt; nec hoc sibi quod scriptum est,
vindicant, sed cunctis auferunt Universa, etc.

Per idem tempus in Urbe Roma, diversis novitatibus per nonnullus regula
traditionis Ecclesiastica vexabatur. Hieronymus ad Evagrium Episcopum, Epistola
octogesima quinta, tomo secundo, ut citatur in jure Canonieo eadem distinctione
supradicta, capitolo quod est in ordine vigesimum quartum simile etiam clare
dicit.


Decimo Septimo. Contra dispensationes Papales.
STare non valet, Gratianus in Rubricam, capitulo octavo.
quod contra Evangelicam vel Propheticam Doctrinam seu constitutionem factum
fuerit.

Nec quicquam, Marcellinus Papa Epistola Secunda.
quod contra Evangelicae vel Propheticae aut Apostolicae doctrinae
constitutionem, successorumve eorum, sive Sanctorum Patrum actum fuerit, stabit.

Non est in Potestate Papae aut concilii aut Ecclesiae, Gerson de vita
spirituali animae.
immutare traditiones datas ab Evangelistis and a Paulo, sicut quidam delirant.
Urbanus Papa etiam, ut citatur in jure canonico, causa vigesima quinta simile
clare dicit.


Decimo Octavo. Contra Ceremoniarum Multitudinem.
HOc apud nos Superstitiosae mulierculae, in parvulis Evangeliis, Hieronymus
commentariis in caput vigesimum tertium Matthaei. Petrus de Aliaco Gardinalis
Cameracensis de Reformat. Ecclesia de refor. Praelat.
and in crucis ligno, and istiusmodi rebus; quae habent quidem zelum Dei, sed
non juxta scientiam, usque hodie factitant; culicem liquantes and camelum
glutientes.

Providentem esset, quod in Divina Servitio, non tam onerofa prolixitas, quam
devota and integra brevitas sevaretur. Johannes Gerson etiam part tertia
operum, de vita spirituali animae, lectione secunda, simile clare dicit.


Decimo Nono. Contra Obligationem, aut in Sacerdotibus, aut aliis, ad
Caelibatum.
REcte autem (Paulus) posuit illud; Theodoretus in quartum caeput Primae Epist.
ad Timothaeum.
prohibentium contrahere Matrimonium. Neque enim Caelibatum ac continentiam
vituperat, sed eos accusat qui lege lata ea sequi compellunt.

Integritas corporis expetenda a vobis est: Ambrosius in libro exhortationis ad
virgins, ut citatur in jure Canonico, causa trigesima secundia, quaestione
secunda, capitulo Integritas, quod numero est decimum tertium. Canon quintus
Apostolorum. Hieronymus tomo primo Epistolarum, libro primo adversus
Jovinianum, page triges tertia, testatur.
quam ego pro consilio suadeo, non pro imperio Praecipio. Sola est enim
virginitas, quae suaderi potest, imperari non potest; res magis voti, quam
praecepti.

Episcopus aut Presbyter aut Diaconus Uxorem propriam nequaquam sub obtentu
Religionis abjiciat. Si vero rejecerit Excommunicetur; sed si perseveraverit,
dejiciatur.

Suo tempore plurimos Sacerdotes habuisse Matrimonia, and Apostolum Episcopum
describere unius uxoris virum, habentem filios cum omni castitate.

Nec ratione, nec autoritate probatur, Cajetanus Cardinalis in Opusc. Tit. 1.
Tract. 27.
quod absolute loquendo, Sacerdos peccet, contrahendo Matrimonium; nec ordo, in
quantum ordo; nec ordo in quantum sacer, est impeditivus Matrimonii.

Sacerdotium non dirimere contractum Matrimonii sive ante, sive post
ordinationem, seclusis omnibus legibus, Ibideus Paulo Post concludit.
stando tantum in his quae a Christo and ab Apostolis habemus. Clemens Romanus
Petri Apostoli Discipulus, and ut Papistae volunt, in Episcopatu Romano
Suecessor libro secundo Apostolicarum coestitutionum, capite secundo,
describens qualem oporteat esse Episcopum, simile etiam clare dicit.


Vicesimo. Quod sola Norma, and Fidei, and Actionum, Sacrae Scripturae sint.
DEus nobis Legem dedit and Testimonia Scripturarum; Hieronymus in Isalae caput
octavum in v. 20.
quae si sequi nolueritis, non habebitis lucem, sed semper caligo vos opprimet.

Sicut stellas Coeli non extinguit nox; Zepherinus Papa. Epist. Prima ad
Episcopos Siciliae, ut citatur in jure Canonico, Distinct triges. octava,
capitulo sicut quod in ordine octavum est.
sic mentes fidelium firmamento inhaerentes Sacrae Scripturae, non obscurat
mundana iniquitas.

Gentilis dicit, vellem fieri Christianus, Chrysostomus in acta Apostolica,
homilia trigesima tertia.
sed nescio cui adhaeream, multae sunt inter vos Pugnae, nescio quod dogma
eligam. Singuli dicunt: Ego verum dico, cui credam nescio, cum utrinque
Scripturas praetexant. Respondeo illi; hoc multum pro nobis. Nam si diceremus
nos rationibus credere, merito turbareris: Sed cum Scripturas accipimus and
illae sunt simplices and verae, facile tibi fuerit judicare. Si quis illis
consentit, Christianus est; Si quis contra illas, Procul est ab hoc Canone.

Non relictus est hominum eloquiis de Dei rebus alius praeterquam Dei sermo.
Hilarious de Trinitate libro Septimo, page centes. viges. quinta.


Oportet omne verbum aut rem confirmare testimonio Sacrae Scripturae, Basilius
Magnus Summae moralium 26. cap. prime.
ad certitudinem quidem and perfectionem bonorum, ad confusionem vero malorum.

Scriptura divinitus inspirata arbiter constituatur a nobis and apud quos
inventa fuerint dogmata Divinis Sermonibus concordantia, Basilius Magnus in
libro Epistolarum, octugesima Epistola, quae est ad Eustathium medicum, pagina
septingentesima decima quarta, edit. Latinae Frobenianae, an. 1560
his omnino etiam veritatis Suffragium accedet. Augustinus septimo tomo, libro
de unitate Ecclesiae, capite decimo sexto, simile etiam clare dicit.


Vicessimo Primo. Quod Seripturae contineant quicquid Doctrinae ad Salutem
necessarium esse.
OMnia Evangelium continet and praesentia and futura, Chrysostomus in Epistolam
ad Titum, homilia Prima.
honorem and Pietatem, fidem, simul omnia praedicationis verbo conclusit.

Non Omnia quae Deus fecit, conscripta sunt; Cyrillus Alex^n^ (...)
sed quae scribentes tam ad mores quam ad dogmata putarunt sufficere, ut recta
side and operibus rutilantes ad regnum C^lorum perveniamus per Jesum Christum.

Omnis enim Scriptura, id est, Cardinalis Hugo de sancto Charo in Postilla ad
2. T. 3.
sacra scriptura quae est de omnibus necessariis ad salutem, and quae est
omnis, id est, perfecta, and ideo privilegiat sibi nomen Scripturae per
antonomasiam.

Sermo est de Sacris literis veteris Testamenti, Cardinalis Cajetanus in 2.
Tim. 3.
quae te possunt instruere, pro, sapientiam docere ad Salutem per fidem, etc.
Habent enim facultatem docendi sapientiam, non hujus mundi, sed ad aeternam
salutem, etc. Item, perfectus, pro integer, constans ex omnibus requisitis ad
perficiendum hominem Dei.

Quum multa fecisset Dominus Jesus, Augustinus nono tomo, tractatu quadragesimo
nono in Jobanuem.
non omnia Scripta sunt: Electa autem sunt quae scriberentur, quae saluti
credentium sufficere videbantur. Tertullianus adversus Hermogenem capite
vigesimo secundo, and libro de carne Christi, capite septimo, simile etiam
clare dicit.


Vicesimo Secundo. Quod Solus Adorandus and Invocandus est Deus.
SOlus Adorandus est Deus optimus maximus, Origines contra Celsum libro octavo.
Soli Preces offerendae unigenito Dei verbo.

Soli Deo per Jesum Preces offerre. Ibidem aliquanto post.


Solum enim Creatorem illum omnium Deum adorare didicimus. Eusebius de
praeparatione Evangelica, libro quarto, capite quinto.


Neque adorandum quicquam praeter Deum legimus: Ambrosius libro tertio de
Spiritu Sancta capite duodcecimo.
scriptum est enim, Dominum Deum tuum adorabis, and illi soli servies.

Sed tamen tu solus Domine invocandus es, tu rogandus, Ambrosius in Oratione de
obitu Theodosii follo centes. triges. septimo, litera C.
ut eum (Theodosium Magnum Imperatorem) in filiis representes.

Is profecto veritatem conservat, qui contra non Creaturam, Cyrillus
Alexandrium libro duodecimo Thesauei, capite primo.
sed Creatorem colit, and ei Soli servit. Dionysius Alexandrinus ut refert
Eusebius libro Septimo historiae Ecclesiasticae, capite decimo: Et Augustinus
prime tomo, libro de vora religione, capite quinquagesime quinto, simile etiam
clare dicunt.


Vicesimo tertio. Quod Papa sit Antichristus.
QUid est hoc Reverendissimi Patres, Arnulphus Episcopus Aurelianensis in
concilio Rhemensi habito sub Rege Capito, in quo deposit^^ Arnulphus Rhemensis
Archiepiscepus, sic loquitur de Episcopo Romano. Huic Orationi etiam non
contradixit Synodus, sed ex sententia Arnulphi. Aurelianensis tum judicatum
est, ut recitatur in Centuria decima Historiae Magdeburgicae Basileae excusae.
quid hunc in sublimi solio residentem, vestu purpurea and auro radiantem, quid
hunc, inquam, esse creditis? Nimirum si charitate Dei destituitur, solaque
scientia inflatur and extollitur, Antichristus est, in Templo Dei sedens, and
se oftendens tanquam sit Deus.

Ego coactus ad Romans Episcopum Provocari, Otto Dux Bavariae in Oratione ad
Episcopos, ut recitatur ab Aventinus libro septimo Annalium Bojorum, Pagina
quingentesima quin quagesima.
jussuque Gregorij Pontificis Maximi Armis mea tutatus sum. Hoc mortuo, Romanum
Episcopum Antichristum esse praedicastis: Egoque deserta Primarij Sacerdotis
Secta, ad Imperatorem defeci, etc.

HE abuses the Caesarion Sword (committed to us by the Will of Heaven) to the
Temporal cares of this World, Lodewick the fourth Emperor in a Decree of a
Council of the Bishops and Princes of Italy and Germany, by a general consent
held at Rome, and published at Rome the fourth Calend of May, in the year of
Christ, 1328. Testifyeth thus of the Pope of Rome.
using it against the Divine precept; he gapeth after a Worldly Kingdom, as he
is a counterfeit Pastor, so he is a hidden Antichrist, he is a Dog covered with
a fine Skin, he striveth with a wolfish Cruelty against the stock of Christ, he
sells abominations, makes again of Hell, Heaven, and Celestial benefits,
and has Entered into a Covenant and Society with the Malicious Saracins, the
Armenian Christians five years together imploring his help. Aventine also in
his seventh Book of the Annals of Bois, recites very many, saying the like.


ENse Caesareo nobis a Caeli numine commisso, Ludovicus quartus Imperator in
Senatus consulto, Episcoporum and Principum Italia atque Germania consensu
facto Romae, and publicato Romae ad quartum Calendas Maii, Anno Christi, 1328.
de Papa Romano sic testatur.
abutitur temporalibus hujus Seculi curis contra Divinum praecep tum incubat,
regno mundano inhiat, sicuti Pastor est person natus, ita mysticus est
Antichristus, canis pellicula tectus in gregem Christi lupina rabie grassatur:
Vendit scelera; In feros, superos, beneficia caelestia cauponatur, cum
Saracenis Armenios Christianos quinque annis continentur ejus Opem implorantes,
infestantibus, faedus societatemque iniit.

These and the like Sayings of the Fathers, being desirous to understand, and
to that end, asking those, under whom I was instructed, to unfold to me their
meaning, they so abruptly and sophistically expounded, that I became thereby
(though I durst not show it) very much dissatisfied; and had never that Opinion
of the Fathers afterward, or at least wise of these men, as I had before; and
had I not given more credit to the Roman Church, then to either of them, I had
immediately fell from my then Religion.

When I had almost ended my Studies, the Jesuits set upon me afresh, thinking
now to have prevailed with me to enter into their Order, but I answered them
much what in the same manner I did before, and having a great desire and full
resolution to Travel, (not so much out of any Devotion, which was the only
thing I pretended, as out of Curiosity) I withal told them (but it was only a
pretense) that if I ever did enter into their Order, it could not be as yet;
for I had made a vow to our Lady the Queen of Heaven, to go to the Holy Land,
to visit the holy Sepulcher of her Dear Son our Savior.

I had no sooner ended my Studies in Divinity, but (receiving three hundred
Pounds, left me some years before by an Uncle deceased, and disposing of my
moneys for certain Bills of Exchange, ordering it to be paid me in other
Countries upon sight, according to my supposed Occasions) taking my Leave at
the College, I betook my self to my Journey, in which, going by Rome, and
making my Address to Cardinal Barbarini, he procured me the Popes Letters for
my salva Conducta. And so departing thence I went for Naples, from thence to
Manfredonia, from thence to Ragusa, from thence to Corfue, from thence to Zant,
from thence to Candie, from thence to Alexandria, from thence to Cairo, from
thence to Joppa; from thence to Ramma, from thence to Jerusalem, from thence to
Bethlehem, from thence to Nazereth, where seeing a House, which they said was
the house of our Lady, I asked how many houses our Lady had in the world, they
said, she never had but one in the whole Universe, and that was it, I told them
that in Europe we were credibly informed that her House was in Italy, at a City
called Lauretta, to whom People came out of all Parts on Pilgrimage, having
been formerly brought from Nazereth thither by Angels: And asked them whether
or no they had lost any House at any time, or had ever found one missing among
them; They answered that then we were credibly informed a false thing; that the
House of Lauretta was a mere cheat; and that they had never lost or missed any.
This made me to think, that the Pope was either notoriously false, or mere
fallible; notorioussy false, in causing us to adore a mere Fiction for our
Ladies House; or mere fallible, in taking that to be our Ladies House which
indeed was not.

From thence returning by Ramma and Joppa, I came to Cyprus, from thence to
Rhodes, from thence to Smirna, from thence to Constantinople so to Caffa, from
thence returning back to Constantinople; and seriously considering of what I
had heard and seen in my Travels, I greatly admired the Grand Diversity, I had
observed in Religion. And being there with much dissatisfyed, I now began to
look for the aforesaid Marks of the Roman Church: but I soon perceived it to be
in vain, for I either found she had none at all, or none she could claim as
Peculiar to her self. Catholic I saw she was not, understanding the word to be
Universal, which she would always have us to do, for I saw others were more
Universal then her self, and there cannot be many Universal Churches. Besides
if she were Universal, how could there be so much Dispute, as daily there is,
betwixt her and other Churches: for she being Universal, there would be no
other for her to dispute with.

2. As for Antiquity, I found it was no more in her than in other Churches; and
in those points wherein she differed from the Greeks and others, she had none
at all: for Antiquity ought to be from the beginning; whereas the points in
which she differed from the Greeks and other Churches, were never thought of in
the primitive times, nor long afterward.

3. As for the Lineal Succession of the Chair, I found that was no mark at all
of the true Church; for the same was as well in other Churches, as that of
Rome. Besides, the Chair of Rome, which seeks to draw its Succession from St.
Peter, was condemned by the rest of the Chairs, who not only had their
Succession from St. Peter, but from the other Apostles. And moreover St.
Ambrose says in his first Book and sixth Chapter of Penitence, Non habent
Hereditatem Petri, qui fidem Petri non habent, that those have not the
Succession of St. Peter, which have not St. Peter's Faith.

4. If perpetual Continuance were a mark of the true Church, then I considered,
we must stay until the end of the World, before we could know which was the
true Church; for who knows until that time come, what Church may continue
until that time come. A Church may exceedingly flourish now, which long before
then may be utterly overthrown. Perpetual Continuance I concluded therefore was
no good mark of a true Church; for besides this, if Perpetual Continuance was a
good mark, then diverse Churches planted by the Apostles, seeing they have long
since ceased, were false Churches: and diverse Churches which have continued
ever since the Apostles time, and yet continue, though the Church of Rome call
them Heretical and Schismatical, would be true Churches. So that this Mark,
though she were sure of it, as she is not, would not only be no good Mark, but
make against her self.

5thly. As for Unity, the fifth pretended Mark of the Roman Church, I found she
had it not by her own Confession; for if she be Universal, as she pretends she
is, then Protestants, Greeks, Arminians, Muscovites, Coftians, and all other
Christians in the whole World, together with Turks, Jews, and Heathens, are all
of the Roman Church; and is there Unity amongst these? If there be, what makes
so much quarrelling and contention betwixt the Church of Rome and them? But
knowing she was not Universal, I next considered her as she was in her self,
viz. a Particular Church. And taking her thus, never did I find in all my
Travels, a Church more divided within it self, both in Faith and Manners, than
this of Rome. For as for their Faith, I observed it was not the same formerly
as it is now, nor now as formerly: For formerly they, believed the Sacrament of
the Eucharist, was to be received by the Laity in both kinds; now only in one.
Formerly they believed a Priest might Marry, and ought not to be Shaven; now
the quite contrary. Formerly they believed Baptism was sufficiently performed
only with Water; now not without Water, Salt, Oil, and Spittle. Formerly they
believed the Eucharist was to be given to Infants; now no such thing. Thus in
every Age they have either changed, added to, or subtracted from their Faith
and Opinion; whereas a Church at Unity in it self, always believes one and the
same thing.

And 2dly. For their Practice, I found therein no Unity at all; for some
followed the Rules of St. Dominick, some of St. Benedict, some of St. Bruno,
some of St. Augustine, some of St. Francis, some of St. Ignatius Loyola, some
of St. Kath rine, some of St. Bridgit, some of St. Ursula, and so some of one,
and some of another, the Rules of whom in very many things are quite contrary.
Some again would have that our Lady was immaculately conceived, and that the
Pope is Infallible; othersome will admit of neither. But perhaps the Papists
will say, All these, together with the other beforementioned, are, and were
Matters of Practice, and not of Faith; but in all Matters of Faith (say they)
we agree: But the plain truth of it is, they define all matters of Faith, to be
those wherein they agree: So that to say the Roman Church does agree in all
Matters of Faith, is but to say they agree in those things they do agree in;
and so do all other Churches.

6thly. As for Miracles, I considered they were not only pretended to be
wrought by those of the Church of Rome, but also by the Turks, Heathens, and
present Jews: And since I could see no reason why to believe the one any more
than the other, (having never known any such thing wrought amongst them) this
signified nothing at all to me. Besides, I observed the Miracles pretended by
the Papists, were in many Ages ago, if ever, wrought; and so many Ages after
the prefixed time of their being wrought, before they were once related to be
done, that they were greatly to be suspected, as merely feigned.

Lastly, I considered the multitude of the Papists, and here I concluded, That
if this were a Mark of the True Church, both Turks and Heathens (and Greeks
also in time past) were to be preferred before them.

Next I camy to Sery, in my Journey to which, considering again of the great
Differences I had observed in Religion, and the several Reasons each Nation
gave, for each Particular in which they differed; and moreover finding they had
all much to say for themselves, that in all things I could not believe them
all, and that I could not be of any one Community amongst them all, but incur
some Censure from one or other, either of Heresy, Schism, or both; I burst
forth into these words.

Good God! in what a miserable Condition is a Man in this Life, he that is an
honest and well-meaning man, that would be, knows not what to be. He would be
a Protestant, but then the Church of Rome would condemn him. He would be one of
the Church of Rome, but then the Greeks, the Muscovites, the Melchits, the
Mengrelians, the Georgians, the Armenians, the Maronits. the Jacobits, the
Nestorians, the Indians, or Christians of St. Thomas, the Centurians, the
Nubins, the Ethiopians, the Abessines, the Circasians, the Bohemians, the
Slavonians, and the Christians of St. John would condemn him. He would be a
Greek, a Muscovite, a Melchit, a Mengrelian, a Georgian, an Armenian, a
Maronit, a Jacobit, a Nestorian, an Indian, or Christian of St. Thomas, a
Centurian, a Nubin, an Ethiopian, an Abessine, a Circasian, a Bohemian, a
Slavonian, or a Christian of St. John, or one of any, or of all (if it were
possible) of the aforementioned; but then the Coftians would condemn him. He
would be a Coftian, or in fine, he would be any thing so he might be a
Christian; but then the Samaritans would condemn him. He would be a Samaritan,
but then the Essenes and the Common Jews would condemn him. He would be an
Essene or a Common Jew; but then the Pharisees and Sadduces would condemn him.
He would be a Pharisee or a Sadducee, or in fine, he would be any thing so he
might be either a Christian, or a Jew, or both; but then the Turks would
condemn him. He would be a Turk, or in fine, he would be either Jew, Turk, or
Christian, but then the Heathens would condemn him. He would be a Heathen, or
in fine, either Christian, Jew, Turk, or Heathen; but then the Atheists would
condemn him. He would be an Atheist, but then the Christians, the Jews, the
Turks, the Heath us, and all the World would condemn him.

In the next place therefore, shutting forth the Atheists, verily believing
there was a God, (for indeed I could believe no other, for Heaven and Earth and
all things therein showed me as much,) I considered that though I could not
believe them in all things all, in regard of their Disagreement; yet in those
things in which they all agreed, I had reason to do no other but to believe
them all. I sought therefore next to see in what they agreed, and finding they
all agreed in these things and no other, viz. That there was a God, to be
adored here; for which there was a Heaven for the Righteous, and a Hell for the
Wicked, the one as a Reward, and the other as a Punishment for the fame
hereafter: I concluded I had reason to believe them in these things, and no
other. So that now I doubted even of Christianity it self. Next therefore being
at Sery, there being a whole Parish of Christians, in which there was three
Franciscans, all Priests, one of which seemed very Learned and Ingenious, I had
a great desire to have some Private Discourse with him, And the better to have
his Advice, and safer to Relate my Doubts, I went to him to Confession; in
which I declared, that by reason of my Travels, I had been brought even to
doubt of the Truth both of Christ and Christianity. The Franciscan Father was
greatly surprised to hear me relate this, and the better to regain me to the
Faith, asked me, Whether I believed there was a God. I told him that that I did
not only believe, but was very sensible of. He then asked me, Whether I
believed the Holy Prophets, the Writers of the Old Testament, were of God. To
this I answered, I greatly questioned whether they were or no. He then showed
me diverse Reasons to prove they were of God, and that therefore, whatsoever was
contained in their Prophesies, must needs be true: Which Reasons, especially
those which were most convincing to me, I have here inserted, to wit, First,
That amongst their Prophesies, many of which (foretelling things many years,
and sometimes Ages before they were to happen) being such as in all
probability, were never likely to come to pass, nor could be conjectured by any
Natural Causes, (as were generally the things foretold by the Heathens and
their Oracles) were notwithstanding afterward most certainly fulfilled. As
first, The Prophecy and Prediction made to Abraham of his Issue, when he had
neither any, nor was ever like to have, Genesis 12.2. Genesis 13.16. Genesis 15.5. Genesis
17.2. Gen, 18.11, 12. Of his inheriting the Land of Canaan; and above all of
his Posterities descent into Egypt, of their time of Servitude, and manner of
deliverance thence; the same being foretold more than four hundred years before
it was fulfilled, Genesis 15.13, 14. And when no likely hood thereof did at all
appear, and yet how exactly the same was fulfilled, and at the very time
appointed by the Prophecy, is declared in Exodus 12.31, 32.

2dly. Jacobs Prophecy of the Kingly Government of Judah, Genesis 42.8, 9, 10.
where there is mention made of his Brethrens bowing down to him, and withal of
his Scepter; the Circumstances whereof, if we seriously consider, are
exceedingly to be wondered at: For first, When these words were uttered by
Jacob, there was no probability at all of any Scepter to be among the Jews or
Israelites; for they were poor and few in number, and never like to be a
distinct Nation of themselves, or to depart forth of Egypt again.

And 2dly. If any such thing should come to pass, as that they might be a
People, and have a Scepter of Government of their own; yet was it not that
Judah and his Posterity should possess the same; for that he had three elder
Brothers, to wit, Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, who in all likely hood were to have
it before him.

And 3dly. When Moses recorded and put in writing this Prophecy (which was
diverse hundred years after Jacob had spoken it) it was much less likely that
ever it should be true, in regard that Moses then present in Government was of
the Tribe of Levi; and Joshua designed by God for his Successor, was of the
Tribe of Ephraim, and not of Judah; which makes greatly for the certainty of
this Record: For that it is most apparent, that Moses would never have put such
a Prophecy in writing, to the disgrace of his own Tribe, and to the prejudice
and offense of Reuben, Simeon, Ephraim, and other Tribes, neither would they
have suffered such a Derogation, but that it was evident to them by Tradition,
that their Grandfather Jacob had spoken it; although then there was no great
likely hood that ever after it should come to be fulfilled. Nevertheless this
was for the time of Moses, whereas if we consider that from Moses to Samuel,
(that was the last of all the Judges) there passed four hundred years more, and
yet was there no appearance of the fulfilling of this Prophecy in Israel; for
that the Tribe of Judah was not established in that Government, it is the more
to be wondered at. At length they came to have Kings to Rule, and then was there
chosen Saul to the Place, who was not of the Tribe of Judah but of Benjamin,
and he was endued with diverse Children to succeed him; who therefore would have
then thought that this Prophecy could have ever been fulfilled? Nevertheless,
when no man thought thereof, there was a poor Shepherd chosen out of the Tribe
of Judah, called David, to be King, 1 Samuel 16.13. which Government of Judah,
held out more than 1200 years together, even until the time of Herod, Eusebius. in
Chron.

3dly. The Prophecy of the same Jacob, for the greatness of Ephraim above
Manasses, Genesis 48.19, 20. which afterward was fulfilled; for that Ephraim was
always the greater and stronger Tribe, Josh. 16. Josh. 17. and became afterward
the Head of the Kingdom of Israel, or of the Ten Tribes, Isai. 7.2, 9. whereof
there was no suspicion or likely hood when Jacob spoke this, or when Moses
recorded it.

4thly. The Prophecy of Moses of the Jews forsaking of God, and of the many
and great evils they should incur thereby, Deuteronomy. 31.16, 17, 18. which afterward
came to pass.

5thly. The Prophecy of the Birth and Acts of Josiah, more than 300 years
before he was born, 1 King. 13.2. which afterward was exactly fulfilled, 2
King. 23.15.

6thly. The Prophecy of Isaiah of the Destruction of Jerusalem by the
Babylonians, and of the grievous Captivity the Jews should be in under them, 2
King. 20.17. Esai. 5.26. As also the Destruction of Babylon by Cyrus King of
Persia, Esai. 13.1, 6. which Prophecy was almost 200 years before the said
Cyrus was born; in which he declared his Name, and how (although a Heathen) he
should rebuild the City and Temple of Jerusalem, Isai. 44.28. Isai. 45.1. which
others of his own Religion had destroyed, all which accordingly came to pass,
and he nominateth two Witnesses thereof, Esai. 8.2. Urius and Zacharias, which
were not born of many years after, the one being a Prophet in Jeremy's time,
Jer. 26.20. an hundred years after Isaiah; and the other eighty years after
that, in the days of Darius, Zach. 1. 1. This Captivity also was not only
foretold by Jeremy, but first, The particular time how long the same should
endure. 2dly. The Destruction of Babylon. And 3dly. The returning home of the
Jews again, Jer. 25.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. all which was fulfilled accordingly,
Ezr. 1. Neh. 3. And to these I might also add diverse other things, all which
being prophesied when there was not any likelihood at all thereof, are a
certain Proof, that these Prophets (and others might be here mentioned) were of
God, and their Writings were writ by Divine Inspiration, which is a manifest
Demonstration of the Excellency of their Writings, and of the truth and
certainty of what therein is contained.

Secondly, the Second Reason he showed me, which greatly convinced me, was that
many of the chiefest and strangest things contained in the Scriptures were
affirmed by the Heathens themselves, (who though they differ something from the
Scriptures in the manner of their Narration, yet do they thereby make the more
for the approbation of the things there mentioned, in regard that thereby it
appears they took not their Histories directly from the Bible, but Tradition
and ancient Antiquities of their own.) for Confirmation whereof, first he
showed me certain Writings of diverse Heathenish Philosophers, who spoke therein
of the Worlds Creation, and the infusion of man's Soul from God. 2. The Writings
of Berosus, Abidenus, Chaldaeus, Damascenus, Egyptius, Nicholaus, and other
most Ancient Heathens, who mentioned the flood of Noah. 3. Of Hesiodus,
Abdenda, Hecataeus, Ephotus, Accusilaus, and Helanicus, which testified that
the first Inhabitants of the World lived commonly a thousand years apiece,
which they said was for Peoples Multiplication, and the bringing of all
Sciences to Perfection. 4. Of Abid nus, Hestiaeus and Sibylla, who spoke of the
confusion of Tongues at the building of the Tower of Babel. 5. Of Eupolemus,
who speaks of Abraham's being in Egypt, of his fight and victory in the behalf
of Lot, of his Entertainment by Melchisedech, of his wife and Sister Sara, and
of the Sacrifice of his Son Isaac. 6. Of Pausaneus, Strabo, Tacitus and
Solinus, wherein is made mention of the Lake of Sodom and Gomorrah, called the
Dead Sea, wherein nothing can live. 7. Of Artabanus and Phylon, who have writ
many things concurring with the History of Moses concerning Isaac, Jacob and
Joseph. 8. Of Aristaeus, who has written the History of Job. 9. Of Eupolemus,
who declares the wonderful things done by Moses in Egypt; for which (he says)
he was worshipped as a God in that Country, called by the name of Mercurius.
And thus he went on from one to another, until he had proved the Truth of the
whole Historical Part of the Old Testament, by Heathenish Authors.

This did exceedingly confirm me in the Truth of the Old Testament, but I
desired to know what this was to Christ and Christianity. He then showed me,
first, how that Christ from time to time had been promised to the World as in
Genesis 3.15. Gen 26.4. Gen 49.10. Deuteronomy. 18.15. Psalm 89. Jer. 33.14. Esai. 11.1.
Mic. 5.2 Secondly, the remarkable things which happened as concerning him which
we adore for Christ, to wit, ifirst, that he was born of a Virgin. 2. That he
was born at Bethlehem. 3. That at his Birth all the Infants near Bethlehem were
slain. 4. That that the wise men of the East came and adored him, and offered
him Gifts and Presents. 5. That he was presented in the Temple. 6. That he fled
into Egypt, and afterward was recalled thence. 7. That a Messenger went before
him to prepare the way for him. 8. That he did wonderful Miracles and healed
all Diseases. 9. That he was betrayed by a familiar friend, his Companion. 10.
That he was sold for thirty Pieces of Silver. 11. That with those Thirty Pieces
of Silver was bought the Potters Field. 12. That he rid upon an Ass to
Jerusalem. 13. That the Jews did beat and buffet him, and defile his face with
spittle. 14. That they whipped and tore his Body before they Crucified him. 15.
That they gave him Vinegar to drink, divided his Garments among them, and cast
Lots for his Vesture. 16. That he was Crucified in the Company of Thieves and
Malefactors. 17. That he was refused and rejected by the Jews. 18. That until
his coming the Scepter was not taken from Judah. 19. That from the building of
the Second Temple unto the time of his Death, were Sixty two Hebdomada's. 20.
That he was crucified by the Inhabitants in and about Jerusalem. And 21. That
immediately after his Passion the second Temple was destroyed. All which (he
told me) unless the first (and I knew it to be true) were acknowledged even by
the Jews themselves, and that also was acknowledged by the Turks. But then in
the next place, I desired to know of him, how these proved, that he whom we
adored for Christ was the true Messiah. He answered that they proved it as
plainly as might be; for all the things before mentioned, had been long before
prophesied of in the Old Testament, viz. (1.) That he should be born of a
Virgin, Esai. 7.14. (2.) That he should be born in Bethlehem, Mic. 5.2. (3.)
That at his Birth, all the Infants near Bethlehem should be slain, Jer. 31.15.
(4.) That the Kings of the East (which St. Cyprian by an Old Tradition of the
Church, affirms in his Sermon of Baptism, were the Three wisemen) should come
and adore him, and offer him gifts and Presents, Psalm. 72.10. (5.) That he
should be presented in the Temple, Mal. 3.1. (6.) That he should fly into
Egypt, and afterward be recalled thence, Isai. 19.1. Hos. 11.1. (7.) That a
Messenger should go before him, to prepare the way for him, Mal. 3.1. (8.) That
he should do wonderful Miracles and heal all Diseases, Isa. 35.5. (9.) That he
should be betrayed by a familiar friend, his Companion, Psa. 41.9. Ps 55.13,
14. (10.) That he should be sold for thirty pieces of Silver, Zac. 11.12, 13.
(11.) That with those thirty pieces of Silver should be bought the Potters
field, Zac. 11.12, 13. that he should ride upon an Ass to Jerusalem, Zac. 9.9.
(13.) That the Jews should beat and buffet him, and defile his face with
Spittle, Isai. 50.6. (14.) That they should whip and tear his body before they
crucified him, Isa. 53.2.7. (15.) That they should give him Vinegar to drink,
divide his garments among them, and cast Lots for his Vesture, Ps. 69.21. Ps.
22.18. (16.) That he should be crucified in Company with Thieves and
Malefactors, Isa. 53.12. (17.) That he should be refused and rejected by the
Jews, Psalm. 118.22. Isai. 6.9. (18.) That until his coming the Scepter should
not be taken from Judah, Genesis 49.10. (19.) That from the building of the second
Temple until the time of his Death should be sixty two Hebdomada's, Dan. 9.25,
26. (20.) That he should be crucified by the Inhabitants in and about
Jerusalem, Zac. 12.10. (21.) That immediately after his Passion the Second
Temple should be destroyed, Dan. 9.25. And seeing they were all fully and
perfectly fulfilled in him whom we thus adore; it was a certain, undoubted, and
manifest truth, that this same Person was the True Messiah.

And now being fully satisfied in this, in the next place, I desired to know of
him, what he had to say for the Truth of Christian Religion; he told me that
the Truth of Christian Religion manifestly appeared by the Miracles wrought by
Christ, his Apostles, and other Saints, whereby it was confirmed and
established. I told him that I had heard the Jews say, that those Miracles were
wrote by Art Magic; He answered that the Miracles done by Christ, his
Apostles, and other Saints, could not possibly be wrought by Art-Magick; for
the greatest Magicians upon Earth, seeking to imitate them, found it altogether
in vain. Nero and Julian, he showed me, gave themselves more to Magic than any
that had ever been before them, merely upon Emulation of the Miracles done in
Rome by Peter and Paul when Nero lived, and by other Saints and Disciples in
the time of Julian; and yet were able to effect nothing in that kind. Pliny he
showed me, that was a Pagan, writes thus of Nero; that as no man labored more
than he in the Art Magic, so no man ever left a more certain Testimony of the
mavelous exceeding vanity thereof. Plin. lib. 30. Not. Hist. cap. 1. The like
in effect he showed me, writes Zozimus of Julian; though he himself was a
malicious Heathen. Zoz. in vit. Julian. And if this same had not been written,
he told me, yet their several extraordinary Calamities, and most miserable
Deaths, which by all their Magic they could not foresee, does sufficiently
testify the same to us; especially the last words of Julian, Vicisti,
Galilaee, vicisti, thou have overcome, O Galil an, thou have got the victory;
acknowledging thereby, as well the divine power whereby Christ and his
Followers wrought their Miracles, as also the folly, vanity, and madness of his
own endeavors.

And now (through my discourse with this Friar) I was more convinced of the
truth of Christianity, than with whatever before, I had either read or seen.
And therefore rendering him innumerable thanks for what he had showed me, I
withal besought him to tell me, which of all Christian Churches he judged to be
the best and truest. He told me the Church of Rome. I desired his Reason; he
told me the true Church was infallible, which none but the Church of Rome ever
so much as pretended to be. That the true Church was infallible, he seemed to
prove from Joh. 16.13. where it is said when the Holy Ghost comes, he shall
teach you all truth; and from 1 Timothy 3.15. where it is also said, The Church is
the ground and Pillar of Truth. And that none but the Church of Rome ever so
much as pretended to be so, I could not but acknowledge, and therefore now I
resolved to continue in the Church of Rome. And from thence, coming into
Dalmatia, Bonifacio Albano Archbishop of Spolato, advised me to enter into
Orders, made me Subdeacon, and after I had continued with him some small time
(having a desire to go into Italy) recommended me to the Grand Duke of Tuscany;
whilst I remained with the Grand Duke, I went to Legorn, where I saw Bishop
JEWELL's Defense of the Church of England, and Dr. Willets three Centuries
against the Church of Rome, and observed that these their Writings were
agreeable to what I had read before in the Fathers.

After this the Grand Duke of Tuscany recommended me to Cardinal Howard.
Cardinal Howard promised to see me provided for, maintained me whilst I stayed
at Rome, caused me to be better instructed in the Ceremonies of Mass, and
designing me afterward for a Mission into England, procured me a License from
the Pope, that I might read the Holy Scriptures in any Language I found them in.

I no sooner read the Holy Scriptures, but I greatly doubted, whether or no any
Adoration were to be given to Images, and fearing that their Adoration might be
Idolatry, or at least wise displeasing to Almighty God, I would when they were
to be adored, as much as lay in me, continually avoid the same. And the rather
in regard I apprehended, that even the Moral Law, which the Papists themselves
say is still in force, did altogether forbid any such Adoration, Exodus 20.

All I found they had to say for the same, was in the understanding a rightly
the Commandment; some would have it to forbid Latria, but not Dulia; other some
to forbid Idols, but not Images; for say they, the word in the Original, is
Pesel, and in Greek, (...), which altogether signifies an Idol; and to this
they add, an Idol is nothing, in regard it represents nothing, and therefore is
not to be adored, because in its Adoration we deifie it: whereas an Image, in
regard it is a Representative, is something; and what Adoration is performed to
it, redounds to the Person whom it represents, and therefore falls not under
the notion of this prohibition.

Upon this, I was fully resolved, could I possibly understand where to meet
with one, to speak with some Jewish Rabbie; verily believing that since the
Commandments were first given to the Jews, he could tell me by their continual
observance thereof since, in what Sense the said command was given, and how
Originally it was to be observed; but enquiring of certain Jews for some
Rabbie, they fearing it was for some ill, durst not discover any one to me, so
that for that time I was forced to let it rest: nevertheless, some few days
following I came to the speech of one, without any difficulty, and that too by
a mere accident, which was as follows;

Having a desire to see some Remote Parts in Rome, which then I had not seen, I
took my way toward Via Flumina; not far from which, seeing a great Multitude of
People gathered together, I drew near to see what was the matter, and coming
near them, I saw a Jesuit preaching out of a Pulpit, Erected (a considerable
height above the Peoples Heads) in the open street. All Comers and Goers, at
leastwise for a while, there staying and giving him an Audience; amongst the
rest, I remained also my self a while, to hear his Doctrine: greatly wondering,
especially in Rome, to see such an action performed in the open Streets, in
regard it was not common; where I had not loytered long, but I saw a great
Multitude of Jews drawing near them, (which I supposed having been upon some
occasion or other at their Synagogue, were returning to their Habitations)
which the Jesuit also seeing, and knowing they must come by that way, gave a
sign to one who there attended him, for the Crucisix; who fetching it out of a
House just by, brought it immediately to him, which the Jesuit receiving in his
Arms, turning his Discourse altogether to the Passion of Christ, held up to be
seen as the Jews were to pass by; which was no sooner thus held for view, but
all the Christians there present, fell down upon their Knees, bowing their
Faces to the Earth to adore it; and the Jews standing at a distance, and
looking thereupon, laughed and grinned one to another thereat: and I for my own
part to avoid its adoration took an Alley, where whilst I loytered to see when
it might be over, three of the said Jews taking notice thereof, came to me into
the Alley, and desired to know of me whether or not I was well satisfied in my
Religion, I told them to speak the truth, I was not very well satisfied with
what I saw there, and that made me to avoid it, and take the Ally; they
answered, so they perceived, and asked me if I had, a mind to speak with one of
their Rabbis; if I had they said they would immediately help me to the speech
of one; I gave them thanks, and desired they would; upon this they consulted
together some small time, to know to whom they had best to bring me, which
having concluded upon, they took me to Rabbi Salvator in via flumina; a man
exceeding well Learned, and of a very courteous, obliging Behavior, who,
having first privately acquainted him with the occasion of their bringing me to
him, leaving me with him, immediately departed. The Rabbie inviting me to come
in, and caused me to sit down, after some small discourse with me, caused me to
go with him into his Study; where desiring to know of me, what it was in which
I was disatisfied, I told him I was disatisfied in diverse things, but the
chiefest was the Adoration of Images. And since the Adoration, or not Adoration
of Them, depended altogether upon the Sense of the Command of God given to the
Israelites upon Mount Sinai; which says, Thou shall not make to thy self any
Graven Image, nor the likeness of any thing in Heaven above, or in the Earth
beneath, Thou shall not bow down to them, nor worship them, etc. I desired to
know in what Sense both he and other Jews understood the same. He told me that
in this Commandment, not only the Adoration of Images, but the very making of
them with an intent to adore them, was Idolatry, and altogether forbidden. As
for Latria and Dulia, (he said) they were humane distinctions, and had no
Ground from Almighty God: I then argued, that this Cmomandment might forbid
Idols, but not Images, and if so, the Adoration of Images was no doubt
allowable. He then asked me what both I and other amongst us looked upon, to be
the difference betwixt an Idol and an Image; I answered an Idol was a Thing
adored as a God; whereas an Image was not a Thing adored as a God, but as a
thing Representing God; to this he said, that an Idol and an Image (let the
Image represent what it would) being adored, were the same thing. The which I
not granting, he desired to know of me, what the Golden Calf was, an Idol or an
Image, That the Israelites, for Adoration, caused Aaron to make in their Return
from Egypt. I answered an Idol. He told me that unless I would grant that an
Idol and an Image were the same thing, that was mine, and others mistake; for
what they adored then, they adored only as a Representative. I desired to know
where he found that, he told me in one of the Psalm. and showed me the words,
where it is said, speaking of the same People; That they turned their Glory (to
wit the True God) into the likeness of a Calf that eats Hay, Psalm. 106.20. So
that (said he) we did not Adore this Calf for a God, but for a Similitude
Representing God; and yet it was punished by Almighty God for Idolatry, Exodus
32. This did convince me very much, nevertheless I desired for my further
satisfaction that he would yet be pleased to give me, if he could, some other
Testimony: he then showed me how the Samaritans, when they revolted from the
other Jews, set up Two Calves, the one at Dan, and the other at Bethel: and
how, notwithstanding, they always afterward adored them, yet they adored them
not as Gods, but as Things Representing God. This he proved out of Ezra, where
it is said, that when the Jews were permitted by King Cyrus to Rebuild their
Temple at Jerusalem, the Samaritans came and would have joined with them in the
Rebuilding thereof, and would for the future have Adored at Jerusalem, but the
Jews not permitting them, they would know the reason: why (say they) may we not
build with you, we adore the same God that you do, Ezra 4.2. which (said he)
could not have been said, had they Adored these Calves for Gods, and therefore
they adored them not as Gods, but as Things only representing God. He Next made
me sensible of the great Plagues and Punishments that Almighty God had often
inflicted for this kind of Worship, all which could not but manifest his
exceeding great dislike thereof.

This Discourse did so fully convince me, and brought me into such a great
dislike of the Adoration of Images, that I perfectly loathed all such
Adoration. And seeing thereby that the Roman Church was fallible, and had erred
in one thing, I believed it might have erred in more.

And now it growing toward Evening, and the Rabbie being sent for to reconcile
some Neighbors that were fallen out, (the Rabbis being, as far as I could
understand, Judges in all such Cases) rendering him thanks for his good
Instructions, I for that time took my Leave of him, who told me that at any
other time, did I please to come to him, he would very willingly and gladly
satisfy me in any other thing: Upon this I came to him several times
afterward, but all he convinced me of besides, was,

1st. That there was no Limbus Infantium. 2dly. That Saints, Angels, and Holy
Relics, were neither to be adored nor prayed to. And 3dly. that a very great
part of the Roman Religion was perfect Magic: all which, with many other
things, I design e're long to manifest to the world.
After this, being not very well in health, and feigning my self much worse
than I was, I desired leave of Cardinal Howard for change of Air to go into the
Country, either to, or some where near Bologna; my design being to go to the
Protestants, and having obtained the same of him, I was no sooner taking order
for my Journey, thinking therein to steer my Course toward some Protestant
Country, but fearing the Inquisition, being Pursued by certain Friars, who
reported they had often seen me in Company of the Jews, I immediately, to
prevent it, made an Escape by Sea to Naples, thinking from thence to get by Sea
into France.

Being at Naples, seriously reflecting upon the many and great Friends I had
then in Italy, and the great Probability I was in of coming there to very great
Preferment, whereas if I went, I knew not whither, viz. to Protestants, to whom
I was altogether unknown, I might be hardly looked upon, and perhaps too, when
I came, dislike their Practice, changing my resolution, I resolved to continue
in the Church of Rome. From Naples therefore, crossing the Country to Barlet,
and so taking Ship for Venetia: and from thence going to Birgamo, getting some
Letters of Recommendation to the Bishop there, he preferred me into a Cannos
Place, and made me a Deacon.

And now I gave my self seriously to the study of the Holy Scriptures in which
I had before made a considerable Progress; and wheresoever I found they did not
agree with the Faith and Practice of the Roman Church, I noted them down in a
little Book; All which I found afterward did agree with what I had before
observed in the Fathers. And revealing the same to my Ghostly Father in
Confession, hoping thereby to receive satisfaction, he gave me such weak and
absurd Answers, that I thereby became the farther dissatisfied.

And now I, again lamenting my hard Fate, that it was my Lot to have been
brought up in the Church of Rome, had a great desire to see the Practice of
some Protestant Church, and therefore pretending a Journey to Lions in France,
to see a Kinsman, who was lately arrived there from Ireland, furnishing my self
with what Money and other necessaries I could for my Journey, I went for
Geneva, purposely to see the practice, and discourse with them of the Geneva
Church. And to the end I might do it the more securely, I again put my self
into a Secular Habit, in which appearing at Geneva, and being an English Man,
the Clergy there never mistrusted but that I was a Protestant; and I being not
fully resolved what to do, told them no other, but that I having been, and then
being, much among Papists, they continually pressed upon me to be of their
Church. And relating to them the several Arguments of the Church of Rome, which
at any time before had served me to retain me therein; I desired their
Instructions, how I might so answer them, as to defend my self against them.

The first thing, I desired of them to make me capable thus to answer, was the
Popes Infallibility, and lest that should not do,

2dly. The Infallibility of the Roman Church.

3dly. The Authority the Roman Church pretends to have over the Scriptures, in
Abolishing and making void part thereof at Her Pleasure.

And 4thly. Her practicing many things which were never mentioned in the Holy
Scripture, for which She pretends Tradition.

All, which several of them, answered so rationally, rationally, learnedly, and
discreetly, that I was exceeding well satisfied therewith, and returning them
innumerable thanks, I desired also to know of them what was the difference
betwixt their own Church, and the Church of England. They answered me, the
difference betwixt Them and the Church of England was very little. The greatest
matter (they said) was only Episcopacy and certain Ceremonies. This made me
whilst I stayed there, which was for the space of a week or such a matter,
seriously reflect with my self what to do. And considering that their Service
consisted most in Preaching, of which I was there very incapable, in regard of
my deficiency for the same in the French Tongue, I resolved for England; not
doubting but I might do God as good Service there, since the difference was so
small betwixt them, as here at Geneva; the which I should immediately be
capable of, in regard of my English Tongue. I was no sooner setting out from
thence toward Paris, designing for England, but hearing I was near the Armies,
and that in my direct way to Paris, I must upon necessity pass them, which
would be very dangerous: I was forced to retire to Lions, where I was much
further from Paris then I was at Geneva.

Being at Lions, having not sufficiently left for my charge into England, my
stock of moneys growing very low, I again began to alter my resolution, or at
leastwise determined for a time, till I was in a condition for my Journey, to
continue in the Church of Rome, hoping Almighty God might accept of what I
there did, since thus constrained thereunto: and so putting my self again into
a Clerks Habit, I hoped e're long to get an Employ. I had been there but a
short time, but Mr. Chapman an English Gentleman of Avinion, and Monsieur
Fargue a French Man, a Person of very good Quality, recommended me to the
Archbishop; the Archbishop was pleased upon their recommendation to give me a
Living, and to the end I might be the better qualified for the same, made me
Priest. I now began to be in care how to defray the charges of my Institution
and Induction, and other present charge and expenses. And writing to a Friend
at Birgamo, acqainting him that I had a Grant of a good Living in France, but
wanting Money for my Institution, Induction and other Necessaries, was willing
upon reasonable Terms to resign my Canons Place there; and therefore desiring
him to help me to some Man that might take it of me; I had not expected long,
but I received his Answer, in which he acquainted me, that if I would apply to
one Monsieur Petite, who was a Shopkeeper in Lions, he had received order to
agree with me for it. And coming to the said Monsieur Petite, he gave me Twenty
Lewie Doors for my Resignation.

And now I was in greater care than ever, sometimes I thought to leave my
present hopes, and to go for England: sometimes again fearing that if I were
there, I might have some dislike, or at least should be altogether a stranger:
and hearing that there was little or no Provision for Men who had commonly done
thus, but that diverse who had turned to the Chruch of England, had been forced
to turn from it again, merely for a bare subsistence whereupon to live: I was
quite off it? but at length considering the Celebration of Mass was the daily
and in a manner only Practice of the Roman Clergy: I betook my self seriously
to read over the Mass Book: verily believing, that if my Conscience could but
dispense with that, as for my Belief, I might the better dissemble it.

When I thus seriously read over the Mass Book, I found first, that some things
therein were false, as the Introibo ad Altar Dei; for their Altar is not the
Altar of God, but a mere Fiction of Men.

And the First and Ninth Part of the Canon, which say the Priest Kneeleth, when
he Kneeleth not: as also the Satiasti Domine familiam tuam, etc. wherein the
Priest gives us to understand, that the People have nothing at all.

2dly. That othersome were foolish, as the Memento for the Dead, wherein is
prayed that God would remember such as are gone before with the Sign of Faith,
and sleep in the sleep of Peace, to grant them a place of comfort, of light,
and peace. And the Amen said after the Secrets adjoined with the Per omnia
Secula Seculorum's: for how can the People say Amen when they heard nothing the
Priest said.

3dly. That othersome therein were Heretical, as the first Prayer in the Mass
for the Dead, and the Offertory: which gives us to understand that the
faithful, departed, may be damned, and that such as have believed and hoped,
may suffer everlasting Torments.

4thly. That othersome therein where superstitious, as the Priests sometimes
standing, sometimes stooping, sometimes kissing, sometimes crossing, sometimes
joining his hands and fingers, sometimes extending abroad his Arms, sometimes
going to the one end of the Altar, sometimes going to the other, and removing
the Mass Book, sometimes turning his face to the People, sometimes his back,
sometimes speaking aloud as all may hear, sometimes softly as none may hear,
etc.

5thly. That othersome were Blasphemous, as the first Collect upon
Ember-Wednesday in Advent, which gives us to understand that the Feast of
Christmas may give us the rewards of everlasting blessedness. The first Collect
on Saturday after Easter; which prays that by our keeping of Easter, we may
deserve to come to everlasting joys. The Prayer at the offering of the Host,
which gives us to understand that the Host not yet Consecrated, is profitable
to the forgiveness of sins, and Life Everlasting. The Prayer for the fourth
Ferie of the Ember days in Advent, the Tuesday after Passion- Sunday, and the
Friday in Ember-Week after the seventeenth Sunday after Whitsunday, which gives
us to understand that fasting may cleanse us, make us worthy of Gods Grace, and
bring us to the everlasting Promises. A Prayer on the Twenty third Sunday after
Whitsuntide, which affirms, 1st. That God desires to be pleased by the Hosts
which the Priest offers.

And 2dly. That God would by those Hosts have safely restored to us the same,
although not yet Consecrated. The Memento for the Living, in which the Bread
and Wine not yet Consecrated, are offered to God for the Redemption of Souls. A
Prayer which desires that God would accept the Blood of his Son, the Redeemer
of the World, as formerly he did the Blood of the Beasts. And the Consecrations
of Ashes, Candles, Boughs, Cheese, Eggs, Bread, Fire, Frankincense, Paschal and
Water, wherein is given to the Creatures, that which belongs only to God and
Christ, as the Power to forgive sins, and to justify and save.

6thly. That othersome therein were Idolatry, as the Priests bowing to the
Altar, his bowing to Holy Relics hid in the Altar, and both Priests and
Peoples Adoration of the Host and Cup.

And 7thly. That othersome therein were Magic, as the Charming of Water and
Salt, etc. and the effecting of things by charmed Images, and charmed Bells,
etc.

Upon this, leaving my Friends and Fortunes beyond Sea, I came presently for
England, where approving well of the English Church, I was at length (after
great persuasions [by one accounted therein very eminent] to the contrary)
reconciled thereunto; but was so long afterward before I got an Employ, that I
was like to starve. Some of the Clergy promising me that which they never did
perform; and others liking me the worse for coming over from the Church of
Rome: so that had it not been for some few certain persons, they would have
driven me (had it been possible) back again to the Papists. After this the
Right Honorable the Countess of Feversham (merely out of Pity) gave me a
little small Vicarage, several of the Clergy then promising me in a short time
to amend my condition, but they did it not. Since which the Court of Canterbury
(notwithstanding I was Legally Instituted and Inducted by the Dean and Chapter,
etc. and had peaceably at least a year and half, if not more, enjoyed my
Living) finding I had not had a Certificate of my subscription to the
Declaration, mentioned in the Act of Uniformity annexed to the Book of Common
Prayer; (notwithstanding my Legal Subscription [in all respects] to the said
Declaration, and the vacancy [both at my Institution and Induction, and during
the three Months the Act allows in which to have the said Cerificate] of the Sea of Canterbury, in which my Living was; so that there was neither Bishop nor
Ordinary [as the said Act requireth] to give me such a Certificate) did first
sequestrate my Living, and afterward pronounce it ipso facto, void, not
suffering me to come into my Church, or to receive from the same any benefit.
So that now I am again like to starve; (and in all bability had starved e're
this, had it not been for my Lord Rockingham, Dr. Lewis Rector of Benefield in
Northamptonshire, and some few others, (whose late exceeding great favors
shown me, I pray God requite.) And what to do I know not: return to the Church
of Rome, I will not; dig I cannot; to beg I am ashamed: and should I (could I
follow any other Employ) leave off the Ministry, I should fall under the Lash
of one of the Canons of the Church of England. And thus, notwithstanding I have
forsook the Romish, and (in all respects) conformed to the English Church, I am
in a strait every way. In fine I cannot but wonder that the Blasphemous and
Idolatrous Church of Rome, should have Colleges both at Paris and at Rome
richly endowed for Perverts; and the Church of England, pretending to abhor
and loath Her, should make no Provision, or afford in the least any Employ to
Converts.

FINIS.
