JAMES, by the grace of GOD, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all to whom these presents shall come, Greeting.
Know ye that We have made a certain Ordinance, Establishment, and final
Decree, whereof the tenor follows in these words:

The Decree and Establishment of the Kings Majesty, upon a controversy of
Precedence, between the younger sons of Viscounts and Barons, and the
Baronets; And touching some other points also concerning, as well Bannerets, as
the said Baronets.
THE Kings most Excellent Majesty, having upon the Petition, and submission of
both parts, taken into his Royal audience and censure, a certain controversy,
touching place and Precedence, between the younger sons of Viscounts, and
Barons, and the Baronets, (being a degree by his Majesty newly created) which
controversy did arise upon an inference only out of some dark words
contained in the Letters Patents of the said Baronets: And having in person
heard both parts, and their learned Counsel, three several days at large
after information taken from the Heraults, and due consideration of such
proofs as were produced on both sides, has declared and decreed as follows.

HIS Majesty well weighing that the Letters Patents of the Baronets have no
special clause or express words to give unto them the said Precedence; And
being a witness unto himself (which is a testimony above all exception) that
his Princely meaning was only to grace, and advance this new Dignity of his
Majesty's erection; but not therewithal any ways to wrong tacitly, and
obscurely a third party, such as the younger sons of Viscounts and Barons
are, in that which is a flower of their fathers Nobility:

And having also had the attestation of the Lords of his Privy Council, who
did declare that the Precedence (after debate and deliberation, while the
Patent of the Baronets was in consultation) was with one consent resolved and
ordered for the younger sons of the Viscounts, and Barons:

And finding also that the clause whereby the Precedence is challenged by the
Baronets, as by a kind of consequence in regard of place given unto them above
some Bannerets, does not warrant their claim (forasmuch as the Precedence
between the Bannerets themselves, and the younger sons of Viscounts and
Barons, appears not to have been regular or certain, but full of confusion
and variety, and therefore not sufficient whereupon to ground such their
pretense) but being chiefly moved by the clearenesse of his Majesty's Royal
intent, and meaning, and the explanation thereof by his Council, (which his
Royal meaning does, and ever must lead his Majesty's judgment in the
interpretation of his own Acts,) has finally sentenced, adjudged, and
established, that the younger sons of Viscounts, and Barons, shall take place
and Precedence before all Baronets.

AND further, the better to settle, and clear also all question of Precedence
that may concern either Bannerets, or the younger sons of Viscounts and
Barons, or the said Baronets, either as they have relation amongst themselves,
or toward others respectively: His Majesty for himself, his heirs and
successors, does ordain and establish, that such Bannerets, as shall be made
by the Kings Majesty, his heirs and successors under his or their Standard,
displayed in an Army Royal in open war, and the King personally present,
for the term of the lives of such Bannerets, and no longer, (according to the
most ancient, and noble institution) shall for ever hereafter in all places,
and upon all occasions, take place, and Precedence, as well before all other
Bannerets whatsoever, (no respect being had to the time, and prioritie of their
creation) as likewise before the younger sons of Viscounts and Barons, and
also before all Baronets.

And again, that the younger sons of Viscounts and Barons, and also all
Baronets, shall in all places, and upon all occasions, take place and
Precedence before all Bannerets whatsoever, other then such as shall be made
by the King himself, his heirs and successors in person, and in such
special case, manner and form as aforesaid.

Nevertheless, for a singular honor to the person of the most high and
excellent Prince HENRY now Prince of Wales, his Majesty's eldest son; as well
the younger sons of the Viscounts, and Barons, as the Baronets, have freely
and voluntarily consented and agreed at the hearing of the said cause, in the
presence of his Majesty, and his Privy Council, and all the hearers, to give
place and Precedence, to such Bannerets, as shall be hereafter made by the said
most noble HENRY, now Prince of Wales, under the Kings Standard displayed in an
Army Royal in open war, and the said Prince there personally present:

Saving the right of the younger sons of Viscounts and Barons, and of the said
Baronets, and of the heirs males of the bodies of such Baronets, for the time
being, in all other cases according to the effect, and true intent and meaning
of their Letters Patents, and of these presents.

ANd his Majesty does likewise by these presents, for himself, his heirs and
successors ordeine, that the Knights of the most noble order of the Garter,
the Privy Councillors of his Majesty, his heirs and successors, the Master
of the Court of Wards and Liueries, the Chancellor and vnder-Treasourer of
the Exchequer, Chancellor of the Duchy, the chief Justice of the Court
commonly called the Kings Bench, the Master of the Rolls, the chief Justice of
the Court of Common Pleas, the chief Baron of the Exchequer, and all other the
Judges and Barons of the degree of the Coife of the said Courts, now, and for
the time being, shall by reason of such their Honorable order, and employment
of State and Justice, have place and Precedencie in all places, and upon all
occasions before the younger sons of Viscounts and Barons, and before al
Baronets, Any custom, use, ordinance, or other thing to the contrary
notwithstanding. But that no other person or persons whatsoever, under the
degree of Barons of Parliament, shall take place before the said Baronets,
except only the eldest sons of Viscounts and Barons, and others of higher
degree, whereof no question ever was, or can be made. And so his Majesty's
meaning is, and accordingly he does by these presents, for him, his heirs and
successors, ordeine and decree, that the said Baronets, and the heirs males
of their bodies, shall in all places, and upon all occasions for ever, have,
hold, and enjoy their place and Precedencie, next unto, and immediately after
the younger sons of Viscounts and Barons; and that no person or persons, nor
State or States of men, shall have or take place between them, Any
Constitution, Order, Degree, Office, Service, Place, Employment, Custom, Use,
or other thing whatsoever now or hereafter to the contrary notwithstanding.

And that the wives of the said Baronets, and of the heirs males of their
bodies, shall likewise by virtue of the said Dignity of their said husbands,
in all places, and upon all occasions, have, take and enjoy their place and
Precedencie during their lives, next unto, and immediately after that place that
is due, and belongs unto the wives of the younger sons of Viscounts and
Barons, and to the daughters of such Viscounts and Barons, Any Constitution,
Use, Custom, Ordinance, or other thing whatsoever, now or hereafter to the
contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

ANd further, his Majesty does by these presents, for him, his heirs and
successors, of his certain knowledge and mere motion, promise and grant to
the said Baronets, and every of them already created, and hereafter to be
created, and the heirs males of their bodies, That neither his Majesty, nor
his heirs or successors, shall or will at any time hereafter erect, ordain,
constitute or create any other Degree, Order, Name, Title, Style, Dignity or
State, nor will give place, Precedencie or pre-eminence to any person or
persons whatsoever, under or beneath the Degree, dignity or State of Lords of
Parliament of this his Realm of England, which shall or may be, or be taken,
used or accounted to be higher, before, or equal to the Degree, dignity or
place of the said Baronets, or any of them. AND therefore his Majesty does
for him, his heirs and successors ordeine, grant, and appoint by these
presents, that all and every the said Baronets, and their said heirs males,
and the wives sons, sons wives, and daughters of the said Baronets, and of
their said heirs males, shall, and may for ever hereafter, freely and quietly
have, hold, and enjoy their said Dignities, Places, Precedencie, and
Privileges before all other which are or shall be created of such Decrees,
States, Dignities, Orders, Names, Styles, or Titles, or to whom such place,
Precedencie, or Pre-eminence shall be so given as aforesaid; their wives and
children respectively, according to the true intent and meaning of these
presents:

Saving nevertheless to his Majesty, his heirs and successors, full and
absolute power and authority to continue or restore to any person or persons
from time to time such place and precedencie, as at any time hereafter shall be
due unto them, which by any accident or occasion whatsoever shall be hereafter
changed, any thing in these presents, or other cause or respect whatsoever to
the contrary notwithstanding.

And now though this Precedent declaration does clearly rid all questions
arising upon the Letters Patents, yet his Majesty having upon the occasion of
this controversy and hearing, and of some of the Baronets grieuances,
propounded out of their own mouths, considered more maturely upon the points
and latitude of their said Patents, his Majesty being resolved (as out of his
own royal mouth it pleased him to declare unto them) to ampliate his favor,
especially where it meets with these so well borne and well deserving Gentlemen,
(this dignity being of his Majesty's own erection, and the work of his own
hands) his Majesty is therefore graciously pleased (not contented with those
marks of his favor, which already they enjoy by the words of their Patent,
which lays such a mark of dignity and precedence upon them and their
posterity) further to strengthen and adorn his Majesty's gracious favor
toward them, with addition of the privileges, preheminencies, and ornaments
ensuing.

FIrst, his Majesty is pleased to knight the present Baronets, that are no
Knights: And does also by these presents of his mere motion and favor,
promise and grant for him, his heirs and successors, that such Baronets, and
the heirs males of their bodies, as herafter shall be no Knights, when they
shall attain, or be of the age of one and twenty years, upon knowledge
thereof given to the Lord Chamberlain of the household, or Vice-chamberlaine
for the time being, or in their absence to any other Officer attending upon
his Majesty's person, shall be knighted by his Majesty, his heirs and
successors.

His Majesty does also grant for him, his heirs and successors, that the
Baronets, and their descendants shall and may bear, either in a Canton in
their coat of Arms, or in an Inscutchion, at their election, the Arms of
Vlster, that is, in a field Argent, a hand Geules, or a bloody hand.

And also, that the Baronets, for the time being, and the heirs males of
their bodies shall have place in the armies of the Kings Majesty his heirs and
successors, in the gross, near about the royal Standard of the King, his
heirs and successors, for the defense of the same.

And lastly, that the Baronets, and the heirs males of their bodies shall have
two assistants of the body to support the Pall, a principal mourner, and
four assistants to him at their funerals, being the mean betwixt a Baron and
a Knight.

And to the end that every of the Baronets, and the heirs males of their
bodies, may have upon all occasions present, use, and proof of these his
Majesty's favors; His Majesty is graciously pleased, that as well the Baronets
already created, as hereafter to be created, shall and may have, and take
Letters Patents under the great Seal of England, to the effect of the said
former Letters Patents of creation, and of these presents, either joint or
several, as they shall be advised by the learned Council of his Majesty, his
heirs and successors, and according to his Highness true intent and meaning.

In witness whereof, We have caused these Our Letters to be made Patents.

Witness Our self at Westminster, the eight and twentieth day of May, in the
tenth year of Our Reign of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the
five and fortieth.
