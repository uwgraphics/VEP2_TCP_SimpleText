H R. In Captain Graftons worthy deserved commendations.
Brave noble brutes, ye troiane youthful wightes,
Whose land does reach the sentoure of the sun:
Your brave attempts by land, on seaes your fightes,
Your forward hearts, imortall fame has won.
The world reports, what Londoners has done,
Freemen I mean, and prentices of worth:
For country service, that are called forth.
Amongst which of name let grafton have his due,
Valiant brave man whose courage none could quail:
His acts at larg here after shall in sue,
And how in fight be often did prevail.
When three to one on seaes did him assail.
Seeking by force his ruin to have wrought:
Which he surpraised and them to england brought.
Read Graftones deeds, you canelires of worth,
Sureuay his life, and learn by him to live:
Whose bounty kindness, and valor showed forth,
If I shoulld write the dastard heart might grieve*
Casting great doubts how they might me believe,
Yet I Will maintain* this captains acts are such:
As few I know will hassard half so much
(...) at his lodging in London.
Sir knowing your kind nature to be such, as ioyed that your friends welfare,
especially those that for there countries good deserve honorably to be spoken,
of as your self in younger years have many ways ieperted your body, in your
countries service whose scars yet remain as badges of your forewardnes, and
desire to gain that your ancesters of fame, long time to there great
commendations maintained, the consideration of which moved me here to fore,
from dungaruan, to aduertize you of the ariuall of our good friend, and your
especial fauouret master William Grafton, at Kinsall, whose succes I wrote you
at large, for that my last lettres (and joy of your freindes good) was so
gracious with you, as one that loves you both well, I make bold to signisie
unto you the said captains safe landing at Clauelly in the west parts, where
my self being commanded on some business of my captains from my place, bownd
for england, crossed by horsh winds, whereunto trauelers are subject being
destressed we wear enforced to put in for the said port of Clauelly, where
happily I met and well met, this brave gentleman Captain Grafton, who as here
to fore I sertified you, having prepared her small caruell called our Lady
fit for the seas, embarked himself at youholl in Ireland well furnished
with brave and resoluit men, and vittailes store, betaking himselse to the
fortune of the seas, where oprest with extreme weather, doing what men might
do by the parmission of God, they endured as long as possible they might, til
for releef they bare for england, ct at Clauelly again replenished there
decayed victtuals, and other necessaries and on sunday the 28. of May being
the sunday next after trinity sunday, they set sail from the said port,
having all that day and night a fair bearing gall, on twesday they espied two
sail as much to wind ward as in the top they might descry who^ they gave chase
unto, and by ten of the clock in the morning, came up with them, which shipes
were both of Bristow, the one the Unicorn and the other a small bark of the
same place. The company of there two (...)ppers they (...)ept the next
morning, when(...) captain Grafton espying some other sails, standing upon the
sailing of his caruell, which is uery good, he parted with the said Unicorn
and her co^sort, and bare with there late descried huls in hope of good hap
which according to his worth he does deservedly merit as time finisheth many
things, so time and short time has brought him within the plain vewe of those
two last discried sails, whom they fownd to be two mighty great fly boats who
serving the King of spame, straied from the fleet, the sight of those made
diverse of his company appaled, whom the good captain with words of great
courage so comforted, that if his discretion had not been more for his safitie
and there is, then there wilful hardines, they would have attempted to have taken
the one of them, but the captain having persuaded them they nevertheless bare
up with them, and thoroughly veewed them, and so departed, shooting ahead the
biger of them, when captain Graftonnes men that lay close showed themselves,
and were of the other perceived, there came presently two shot from them which
mist the caruill the lesser fli^ boat being good of sail, gave them chase,
that day till three a clock, whom the Captain perceived and by little and
little slacked there sail, to see what they durst do, being from her consart,
which she had over shot at least two leages.

The fly boat ^^^^ing upon the Captain who made no have to run a way, but
determined to change a shot or two with them, provided them selves for the same
fight, knowing well they might at their pleasures l^aue or take, having but one
cast Piece a board, and that the mouth broken, the guner a stout and Proper man
made ready, by that time all things was fited to the Captains mind, the fly
boat with fourteen or fifteen men in armor wanned them to lee ward, railing
and reuiling them, with speeches most odious, to whom the guner sent such a
token by his Minion, that with the cross bar, he was charged, he split the
missen mast in the step, and did much other harm as well in the Captains
Cabin through which it went, as slaiing some men which was seen to be cast
over board. Thus for three hours they continued a sore fight, the Captain
being ever foreward to (...) there ordinanc otherwise should have done them
most harm, yet of such height was this foul cart from the Caruill sides, that
their talest man migh hardly reach their channel holes, so that there was no
entering but with great danger, and therefore for safegarde of their men, the
Captain gave over the fight, and not of fear for his men were resolute, and
doubted not the good success, and happy conquest of their enemies.

Thus near six a clock in the evening the caruill parting, the fight bareing
rome from them, whose consart was now come up with them, continuing his course
toward the Islands, with fair and good weather where they had many chaces,
which because their actions were little worth to rehearse, I omit to tell you
of the blessing of the Almighty, on this worthy deserving Captain, whose godly
mind and good dealinges with all men the Lord does reward. Sailing still toward
the Islands the seventh day after they lost the sight of our own land, (silly)
they espied in the height of forty two leager, two sails the one of them,
being of burden an hundredth and twenty tuns or there abouts, having in her of
men forty six, furnished with ten cast Pieces, the other of some three score
tun or there abouts, with sixteen men in her, well sir after the captain
had hailed them, and bad the^ strike, they bearing Spaniards proud minds,
seeing so small a Caruill as this our Lady of the Captains, scorned to yield,
but made reddie to fight, and both began with all their force to assail him
most hotly, the gunner, from the great ship, shot the Caruilles mean missen
from the yardes shered many ropes and did them great mischief, so that with
splycing and repairing, the same company was greatly pusseled, in this time the
Captain calling for a can of Wine and drinking heartily to them, desired them
all as they loved him to follow him, and at the next coming up they would
board her where to they were al very willing, and coming up with them again,
the Gunner with his broken mouth Minion, racked him fore and often, the bar
entering at the star went thoroughout: then coming up in her quarter, the
Captain leapt in at their cheane holes, and one other with him who was hardly
(...) weapons, yet kept (...) place, when the ships faling off, he had no
remedy, but abide that chance God had allotted them, the company aboard loath to
let their Captain rest in so great danger came aboard again, when valiantly
they entered, his boy being with the first aboard had taken down their Flag,
to the great grief of the enemy, who now repenting their hardiness craved
mercy, the other small Ship seeing all the men of War almost aboard,
their Prise laid the Caruell aboard, but to their great cost. For there being
courageous men, entered but six of them with their swords and dagers, swords
and targates and such as they had, and stowed the fifteen Portingauls so that
they were possessed of both sooner then they exspected, the Captain seeing the
other was taken gave God thanks for his goodness, then demanded the Captain of
whence they were, they answered (of Viana in Portugale, and came from
Parmabucca) laden with fine white Sugars, and diverse Negros, when the company
had made through sarch for pillage, the Captain determined to bare for
England, which his company willingly agreed unto, praising him that gives all
victories for their good success, first in delivering them without peril from
the flie-bootes; next for their prises, who was able being furnished with
Englishmen, to have beaten four such Caruiles, with ten pieces and forty and
six men, the other sixteen men besides Negros, the Caruill in all had but
thirty seven men one cast piece, wherefore having named their prises, they had
men few enough to carry home the Caruil, which compelled the^ to leave one
other Caruil laden with Sugar behind them, a good pleasure to the poor
Portugalles, which looked with their neighbors to go for England, thus in five
weeks returned the Captain to Clauelly from whence they went and sooner might
if God had favored them with fair winds. At the same port the said Captain
discharged his goods royally paid each man of his company with the most, so
that as well the pesant as the best had no cause to complain, the Portugalls
his prisoners he kept a shore at board wages, so long as they remained with
him, and after his business ended, causing the good Jesus his small prise to be
rigged and vitled for three months, he gave her the prisoners to bring them
home with their Negroos and money largly, by which his bounty and charity to
these poor men no doubt he gains as well love of God, as favor and the
loving kind hearts of men. Thus far with favor I beseech you exscept my
simple writing and joy with me as I know you do for your friend whom God by
his grace has sufficiently blessed with wealth, as here tofore I certified
you, his own ship was the grace of God, who took our Lady and saint Anthony,
our Lady she made a man of war, who has taken now those two prises laden
with sugar the one called saint Fraunces, the other the good Jesus, both of
Viana, a wonder of the Lord, to appoint this Spanish saints to make rich his
english sailours, as by this valiant Captain is showed, for how many Captains
has had such blessings as this gentleman, or who more fortunate, whom Jesus
our Lady S. Fraunces and S. Anthony, has brought their blessings there news,
there is none worthy to write, but for your hawks, I hope by saint James tide
to bring you, till then with my heartiest commendationes, I leave you to his
protection whom I daily pray to bless us all from Barnstable in the north of
Devonshire this 6 of July 1592.

yours ever ready to use H. R.
