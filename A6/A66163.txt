His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
I HAVE had such Assurance of your good Affections to Me, that I come now to
Thank you, and particularly for the Supplies you have given Me.

The Season of the Year is so far Advanced, that I can no longer Delay My going
into Ireland; And therefore I think it necessary to have an Adjournment of the
Parliament.

And though it shall be but to a short Day, yet unless some great Occasion
require it (of which you shall have due Notice) I do not intend you shall Sit
to do Business until the Winter; And I hope, by the Blessing of God, We shall
then have a happy Meeting.

In the mean time I Recommend to you the Discharge of your Duties in your
respective Countries, that the Peace of the Nation may be Secured by your
Vigilance and Care in your several Stations.

Then the Speaker by His Majesty's Command said, My Lords and Gentlemen, July
next.

And accordingly both Houses did Adjourn themselves to the Seventh Day of July
next.

FINIS.
