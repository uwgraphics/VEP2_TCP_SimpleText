A Whip for the back of a backsliding BROVVNIST.


Help Neighbors help, good women come with speed,
For of your help there never was more need,
Mid-wives ma^e haste and dress you as you run,
Either come quickly or we^re all undone,
The worlds in lab^ur, her throws comes so quick,
That with her pain she is grown stark lunatic,
For I d^d ask one of her Bratts of late:
Why the Lords Prayer was almost out of date,
He told me Christ had new Disciples now,
That of set form of Prayer would not allow;
Alas said I are they so dainty grown,
Such a fantastic Crew was never known,
These are the Brethren of the Separation,
The Cancor worms of this our English Nation,
And it is feared if ^hey be let alone,
These worms will know the Kingdom to the Bone
These with the Papists breed the mischeife here,
Whilst Cockle Bra^nes builds Castles in the air,
Who Parrot like they having learnd to prate,
Disturb the Church the Commonwealth and State,
Yea Church disturbers learnings Enemies,
Yea seeming Saints, yea painted Butter-flyes,
Yea Bug-beares of a Kingdom silly Elues,
Whose Zeal transports you quite beyond yourselves,
Oh know you what you do, that yea presist,
Still day by day in doing what you list,
Shame to our Kingdom if this suffered be,
From hombred strife we never shall be free,
If that you rule the roast you Moone-Calues all,
Why do you force my Muse to railing fall,
That never was accustomed to scould,
Had not so good a Cause made me so bold.
Gods sperit evermore good sperits makes,
Then if your sperits of Gods sperits pertakes,
You will be ruld by order, not by will,
God is the same, the God of order still:
And you cannot be his Disciples right,
That end what you begin in hate and (...)
I judge no man but what their actions show
Brings me of force to judge of what I know,
Good Sister Mag-pye and good Brother Daw,
That ^eapes over hills and (...)bells at a straw
I pray be patient trouble not the State,
Your friends at Amsterdam do for you wait,
Mistake me not I speak but this to prove you,
I de rather have you stay (...) I love you,
Yet if you stay I Would have you know what is meant,
Betwixt an (...) and an Ornament,
Which if you do I should be g^ad to hear.
That to ou^ Church once more you would repare,
Which though it be of Stone should not be hated.
Cause to GODS service it is consecrated,
I know not what your Barnes and Stables were,
Where Asses, bray, pray understand and hear,
I speak unfainedly I blush to see,
Such men so wise in show such Fools to be,
What though the good and bad together meet;
Within the Church as well as in the Street,
Shall we refrain the Church ever the more,
Alas alas your Argument is poor:
How angry were the Pharisees and why,
Because our Savior Christ kept Company
With Publicans and Sinners think on this,
And rectify your judgments that^s amiss.
You being good shall in the Chansell sit,
The wicked in the Bellfree as it is fit,
If they be so contented on Condition,
You Will come to Church and not run to perdition,
No Drunkard nor no Swearer shall sit near you,
For to anoy or other wise to fear you,
Because I know you timorous are by nature,
And wounderous fearful of a wicked Creature,
The Book of Common Prays refind shall be,
Or you shall pray extempory and be free
From all occasion of a thing so common,
No not so much as look upon a woman,
They shall sit by themselves, let this suffice
For fear your sperits on a sudden rise,
And lead away your minds from what is good,
Brethren we know you are but flesh and b^ood.
Upon Condition you to Church will go,
He do the best I can to have it so,
Which if I do I hope I am your Friend,
As I desire to be, and so I end.
Finis.
