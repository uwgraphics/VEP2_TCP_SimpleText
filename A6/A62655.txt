Timely Advice, From the Major part of the old SOLDIERS In the ARMY, To all
the rest of our Fellow SOLDIERS, Wherein is held forth the Politically
intended Destruction of the whole SOLDIERY By our new Masters. From an Officer
out of Scotland.

Printed in the Year of our Lord, 1659.

Brethren and Fellow Soldiers,
UPon the serious and sober review of all our pristine magnanimous, and
undaunted Actions in the Army in time of War, And that while we were all
unanimous and zealous for the common good and welfare of this Nation, We were a
Terror to all our Enemies round about, though now become a laughing stock to
all our enemies that see our inconstancies, whom nothing can please; but what
we cry up to day, we cry down to morrow, only led thereunto by the Capricious
brains of a few weak single persons, Who without us, are nothing; yet we look
not into our own Abilities and Power, but like heedlesse Children cast our
dearly bought Honor at our heels: So we are emptied from Vessel to Vessel,
and every day made more and more Slaves to to our own Contrymen, which is as
dishonorable in every true English man to suffer, as it is unworthy in them to
impose; and yet all must be done politically, under pretense of Religion, and
the Liberties, and Privileges of the People, when daily Experience shows us,
that nothing less is intended: Is it not then a shame the Power and change of
Government being in us, that we cannot see and prevent our own Ruin and
Destruction? when every Man can clearly discern the Face of Fallacies, in the
Glass of his own Woes, and that we are headlong running to Confusion. In the
abundance therefore of our zeal and Cordial Love toward the rest of You our
Fellow Sufferers, and Soldiers in the Army, We have thought very fit to
acquaint you, as well with what we have Discovered, and Collected from the
Actings of our Superiors, as our resolutions to let loose the Raines of our
Power and Liberty. For it is not a Time for our Superiors to strive who shall
be Greatest, and perpetuate themselves a Multitude of Princes, Feeding upon the
Ruins of the People, and Fat of the Nation, when We, our Families, Wives, and
Children, and all that is near and dear unto us, may beg, starve, and perish:
Therefore as stout Soldiers, whet and rowse up your Spirits, Let us not any
longer with great Words be overawed, like Dogs with a Cudgel.

It is well known that we are all very much in Arreare of Pay, And that the
Monthly Taxes have been paid beforehand, with the the Excise in all the
Counties, Customs, Delinquents Estates, besides many other Advantages, whereby
far greater sums have been raised, then would satisfy all our Arrears,
through want whereof, our Wives and Children have been so much destitute of
Bread and Drink, that we have been forced to sell and pawn what we had for
Bread to satisfy their hungery stomachs; yet no care or provision is made for
our payment by our present Masters, who will still exact Taxes, though they
distract Trading, and make many thousand Beggars, as well in the City, as
Country; nor care they how despicable, or to what extremities they expose us,
so they make themselves great.

In the time of Oliver late Protector, there was constantly some reasonable
time taken for payment of us: And do but consider how careful was Richard the
Protector, for paying off all our Arreares to which purpose he was very earnest
with the late Parliament, and they thereunto with him did Comply, so that we
are truly sensible to have been paid off clear, before this time, if they had
been suffered to sit, for which we now repent at our own weakness, in
suffering the Dissolution thereof, by a few Ambitious self-ended persons, who
daily study new Forms of Government thereby to Advance themselves, though to
the ruin of a Nation: When time and experience has taught all Ages, that a
Government in a single person lawfully Elected, is most safe, most for the ease
and appeal of the Oppressed, most Honorable, most Peaceable, most Heaven-like;
and most Consentaneous to an English heart.

That we well understand the Resolves and Intentions of Parliament, are first
to settle the Militia, as stawking Horses for them, the the better to catch
their Game, then after that, either to send us beyond Seas, out of our Native
Country, to be destroyed like Vagabonds in a strange Country at their
pleasures, Contrary to the Liberty of Freeborn People, or else Disband us at
Home, and leave us with our Wives and Children to beg our Bread in our own
Nation, where we shall be quickly destroyed and our Posterities, by such as
have been, and are inveterate Enemies to us and the Commonwealth; And which
shall be all our reward, after shedding of so much blood as has been lost, for
regaining our lost Liberties; And therefore is it not pertinent we all in time
provide for our own safety, which we shall never enjoy without the Government
of a single person, our absolute and chief preservation?

That Richard Protector, nominated by his late Father, according to the humble
Advice, Chosen and Proclaimed, by Consent of Council, Parliament and Army, is
undoubtedly the Lawful Successive Governor over these Nations, and
acknowledged by the many Addresses from most Counties and Corporations in
England, and also from the Armies in Scotland and Ireland, looking upon him as
their Lawful and Supreme Governor, which we are Unanimously resolved to
maintain, being well assured of the City of Londons Faithful Compliance with
us; And do therefore require your willingness, and undaunted Spirits of
Assistance to join with us.

That we are not resolved to pass any Musters, (though we may draw to the
Field the better to be informed of all your freeness, and willingness herein)
until our present Masters shall, and have paid all the Arreares due unto us.

That so soon as the Lord Henry Cromwell, shall appear with an Army in England,
We are, and shall be generally resolved to join with Him, for Re-establishing
Richard, Lord Protector, in which Resolution we hope you will be as free to
join with us as the City; And chiefly it being the only way for all our
Advancements, and Preservations of our selves and you, yours, and your Wives
and Children from the intended Destructions.

And lastly, The whole Country being gererally sensible, our new and present
Masters act no good or settlement of Trade in the Common wealth, nor for relief
of the Oppressed; We are resolved to Dissolve them (without advice or consent
of Officer) at such time as shall be concluded upon at our next general
meeting, having many thousands with and about the City in readiness to join
with us; And do there desire your Appearance and Compliance at the time, for
does not the power of change of any Government test upon us? Then let us act
like Men and Christians, not fearing any, so shall we bring a settled Government
in a single person again, and perfect Liberty as Freeborn People, which at
present is enjoyed but by some particular persons.

FINIS.
