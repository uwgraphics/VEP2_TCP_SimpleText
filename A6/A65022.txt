A VINDICATION OF Mr. VVELD.

WHEREIN, The Case between him and his Opposers, is truly Stated, and the
Church Way of Christ soberly Asserted.

In Answer to the Aspersions most unworthily cast upon him by Mr. James Cole,
Tho: Potts, Tho: Arrowsmith, George Johnson, and Ralph Clavering, (an ill
recompense of all his faithful Endeavors for their Eternal good) and
themselves manifested to the world what spirits they are of.

By a Friend to Truth, and an Enemy to Lies.

Psalm. 37. 5. 6. Commit thy way unto the Lord: And he shall bring forth thy
Righteousness as the Light.

Printed in the Year, 1658.

A Vindication of Mr. Weld, etc.
MAs^er W^ld looking upon this Pamphlet, as a false s^arrulous pitiful piece
of reviling; and the Authors thereof so fully proclaiming to the world wh^^
spirits they are of (their actions being too conspicuous to all men that know
them) could not but pity the poor men's folly, and the hardness of their
hearts (being upon all occasions ready to show their teeth at him, though not
at all able to bite.) Hereupon, he considering Solomon's Counsel, Prove. 26. 4.
Not to answer Fools according to their folly; and that this sorry Paper (to
every intelligent Reader) so fully answers it self, that it needs no other P^n
but their own to render them and their work odious to the world. Hereupon (I
say) he fully resolved to do a^ King He^^k^ah his servants, when Rabs^akey had
rayled and blasphemed, its said, They held their peace, and answered him not a
word, but spread it before the Lord, Isay 36. 21.

Yet I standing by, and troub^ed that such hideous stuff should be wholly let
pass, and such men as they gr^w wise in their own conceit, and knowing also
in my own Conscience the innocence, integrity* and ^aithfull dealing of Mr.
W^ld toward these poor ungr^tefull, and malicious men's s^u^es* from his first
coming amongst them, even to this day, beh^lding daily the travel of his
soul for their eternal* good, had they but eyes to have seen it.

Hereupon (I say) my spirit was so drawn out, That I could not be ^^lent, to
see these sorry men to act the Fools part in a Morris-dance, with Bells about
his Legs and a Fools Cap on his Head, to skip, and friske, and gi^gle, and so
make spo^t for them that are as wise as himself.

What I shall Write, shall be upon certain and evident knowledge, which shall
be ready (if any doubt) to be made manifest ^ndeniably; Yea, what is here set
down is no other then is already known to most that live in this place, and
must be confessed, and cannot be denied by the Authors of the Book themselves,
and most perti^ulers under their own Hands: And so there need no man's name to
be set thereto, the things themselves being written with the beams of the
Sun.

First, I shall briefly show Mr. Welds dealings with these men, and their
carry^ge toward him; and then let the honest Reader judge whether he or they
be to blame; and whether of them are the Promise-breakers.

First, When Gateshead had been long void of a Minister, and none could be
obtained to settle amongst them, though many were sough^ after; Then Mr. Weld
(out of the compassions of his soul toward that distressed People, at their
instant and pressing reque^^s) accepted the place, although he was at that very
time earnestly invited to far more desirable places (as Newcastle, Dur^am,
Nottingham, Morley, etc.) yet being sensible of Gate^heads extreme necessity
above all the other places named, studied not hi^ own case and quiet, but
forsook them all, and pitched on Gateshead, although he then saw many sad
discouragements lay in his way; as, No house at all to live in, but a mountain
of Dung in the place of it; the Hospital houses all ru^nous (which cost him
dear to repair;) the people far out of order, and without Government, many
outcries against the people beating his ears; ye^ his compassion to the poor
peoples souls digested all; (oh, how woefully have these five persons, and
some others of them whom they call the four and twenty, answered all this his
love?) And what his pains and faithful labors, his loving and patient
carryage toward them have been all along, all the god^y in these parts know.

Secondly, But before he would accept the place (behold his honest and plain
dealing with them;) For upon a Lords Day, after his Sermon, in the Pulpit, he
declared to a very great audience; That if he took the place, it should be on
this Condition, That he would engage only to Preach the Gospel unto them, and
Visit the Sick, and that they should expect no other work from him then th^s,
(unless^ he should see cause to Dispense other Ordinances;) no^ have cause to
say afterward, (in case he should do no more) that ^e deceived them. This he
plainly spoke, and told them moreover, That if they did no^ accept of him upon
these terms, they should signify their minds to the contrary to him* before
the next Lords day after; and that if they did not so do, he would take their
silence for a consent; or else, that h^ would turn from them to the right hand,
or the left. Now not any one man or woman in that time ever came to him to
signify their dis-acceptance; so he took it for an ab^olute grant, and sat
down with them. And this was no Imposture in him, or a project to gain
admittance, (a^ the Pamphleteers do absurdly, and maliciously suggest;) for
its evident, he had the Call to sundry the abovenamed places in writing at
that time lying by him, which, he says, he will show to any that desire to see
them.

Thirdly. As his expressions were plain to them; so also their own Call, which
in Writing they sent to him under a hundred and fifty hands, was as clear that
they called him, only to Preach the Gospel. The words of the Call are these;
Sir, We cannot but look upon our selves in a dis^ressed Condition, and so have
been these many years, even as poor Sheep scattered upon the barren Mountains,
i^ great danger of the Wolf, without food, leader, or guide. And ha^ing; to
our great comfort, had a taste of Gods gifts in you, whereby we conceive you
able and fit to inform, convince, co^vert, and edify our souls in the grace
of the Gospel.

Hence it is, That we have been stirred up ever since we heard you, and are so
still, with many a longing de^^re (that if the will of God so be) to enjoy you,
and continue you among^^ us. And therefore do earnestly entreat you in the
bowels of Christ Jesus, to take compassion on our souls, and to Dispense the
Gospel to us: (as for other Enjoyments, and Ordinances, we cannot presume upon,
till you shall know us better, and find us fit) which if God shall persuade
your heart unto, we shall receive it as a mercy from God, beyond all worldly
enjoyments; for which we shall desire to pour out our souls in praises to his
name; and do promise, by the grace of God assisting (without which we are
nothing) to account your feet beautiful, to yield obedience to the Word you
shall dispense from God, and to submit to your wholesome Admonitions, and to
all other duties of a loving and willing people; and finally, for to walk as
shall comfort your spirit, i^ beholding our conversation, that you may see the
travail of your Soul amongst us, and rejoice that over G^d brought you to us:
Thus we waiting upon God, to put a comfortable answer into your mouth, We rest,

Your Affectionate Friends, Thomas Potts. James Matther. R^lph Rutter. Henry
Alder. Ralph Thompson. Peter Green. James Cole. John Atkinson. John Willoly.
And above sevenscore more.


Here see first, The work they call him to, Is only to Dispe^ce the Gospel,
and no other Ordinances, till he shall see them fit. Secondly, What a singular
mercy from God, and favor from him* they would account his condiscention to
thi^ request. Thirdly. What an obedient people to his Doctrine, how l^^^^g and
respective to himself he should find them. But how these Persons named* and
some others like them, perform their Covenant, let God and Man judge (I speak
not of all, for there are many in this p^ace that bless God that ever they
knew him, and of whom he has been heard often to say, he could live and dye
withal.) I beg of God, that this very Paper of thei^^ be not at the great day
a swift witness against these Authors of the B^ok, and diverse others amongst
them, but that they may repent in time* and bethink themselves how they have
answered their promise to God, and his faithful Minister.

Fourthly* Yet n^twithstanding after a^l these p^ain and public expressions
of Mr. Weld, and the Parish^oners engagemen^s under their own bands to expect
from him no other Ordinance but Preaching the Gospel behold their dealings.

Fi^^^, Ralph C^avering (a b^ld and insolent man) breaks the round, and
presses him to Baptize his ^hi^d, which when Mr. Weld very mildly told him, He
could not do, and that himself, well knew as much, what bitter invectives, and
scurrilous language he gave, would not be seemly to relate.

After him came another of the Pamphleteers, George Johnson (though he well
knew Mr. Welds mind; yet, that he might have somewhat to object against him)
presses him to Baptize his Child. After their Pipe, some others also Dance,
and urge the same thing: And after this, the four and twenty and Church
war^ens, in their Meetings, and in private also, for many years t^get^^r (upon
all occasions, and without any occasion at all given) ^^ase not to vex, and
tire, and tear wi^h words; Mr. Weld upon this very account, spitting
their-rage against him* because he will not Baptize their Children, and give
them the Lords Supper, although he has often shown them their C^ll under their
own hands to exemplhim. And yet, (which is more) he has often told them, that
whosoever of them desired the Sacrament (let them but be able to manifest their
knowledge, blameless lives, and the work of grace in their hearts) they shall
be dearly welcome.

Fifth^y, Whereas some of these men, and some others, promised Mr. Weld. upon
his coming, that his charges should be borne; yet whereas his remove all of
Persons and Goods from the Sou^h, by Land and Sea, cost him above thirty
pounds; and his Orders for settlement from the Parliament near twenty pounds;
they (very fairly) turned the charges upon himself, and ga^e him not one
Groat toward all.

Sixthly* That they may yet further declare to the world who are the dishonest
men, and such as break^ promise (which they most unjust^y father on Master
Weld) take but another instance.

At his first coming, they themselves, without any motion of his, offe^ him
for his better s^^^istance, a yearly contribution of forty pounds, and bring
him a Paper of their own Writing, subscribed with more then ^40 hands for that
purpose; the words whereof are these. viz. It has pleased the Lord now as
length to bring his Gospel home to our Doors, and to send us a faithful, able
Minister (which is Mr. Weld:) We therefore considering the premises, do freely
and faithfully promise for Mr. Welds better subsistanc^, to contribute to him,
so long as God shall please to continue him amongst ^^, these s^mm^s following
Quarterly.

James Cole 10 s. Tho: Potts 10 s. Henry Alder 5 s. Thomu^ Wilkinson 10 s.
Nicholas Wilkinson (...).
And above (...) the C^ll* yet for these many years together break their
promise, and Childishly say, It was but for a year, or two, or three, they
meant: Only a few that are honest, and make Conscience of their engagements,
faithfully observe their Covenant to this day; so that he is a loser near 100
l. by this their unfaithful dealing. All which things (for peace sake, and the
Gospel, hoping to win them by love at last) he quietly bears.

Seventhly. Mr. Weld being to Administer the Lords Supper to the Church whereof
he is Pastor, though he well knew his power to do it in the body of the
Church, without asking any man leave, being by his Order from the Parliament,
Invested in express terms into the Church it self. Yet for peace sake
(knowing these men's spirits) desired their consent, and it was denied. And
after at a meeting of the four and twenty, Mr. Hammond joined with him in the
same request; but all to no purpose. Yea one of them (as it was repor^ed) said,
He wo^ld rather lay his blood under the Communion table, then ^ver give consent.

Eighthly. Then the Quire being made fit for that purpose, though Mr. W^ld knew
the Vestery belonged to him, as his right, and so might have made use of it for
any public service: Yet sent the Sexton, to desire they might have the use of
it at the Administration of the Sacrament* to set their Pots, Cups, Bread, and
Wine th^^ein for present use; which was expresse^y denied* as the Sex^^n
affirmed to their faces, November the 3d. they choosing rather to employ the
said room for Lime and Sand, and other rubbish, then for the furtherance of
the worship of God.

Ninthly. And as the Church and Vestery was denied; so (that these men might
show themselves perfectly averse to Mr Weld) they let out the Grass of his
Church yard one year after another, and received the Rent, and kep^ it from
him by force (yet he not willing to con^end, let them alone;) and because they
would make sure of the money, take the r^nt aforehand of him they let it to.

Yenthly. Wh^rea^ the Apostle requires people, to have their Minister in
singular l^ve* for his works sake: See how these very m^n (viz. James Cole.
Thomas Arro^smith* (...), and Ralph Clavering) perform their duty of love.

For when a Commission came down the last year* for giving in the value of
every Living in this County; these men supposing (fot so it was given out) that
the end of the Commission was. That every Living above a hundred pound per
annum, should be levelled to an even hundred pound. These men named, being
Jurior^ for Gates^ead* resolving to give up his Living at 150 l. that so they
might dep^ive Mr Weld of 50 l. p^r annum of it, (though they knew they should
thereby deprive all their succeeding Ministers of so much;) which Mr. Weld
hearing of, did demonstrate, by showing them all his Leases for b^th Re^^ory
and Hespi^all that the yearly revenue ac^^uing from both wa^ sh^r^ ^f 100 l.
per annum, (and what ever he received more, was upon another account:) yet they
he^d their purposes; and that they might act their parts with more confidence)
Mr. James C^le sent Mr. Weld a bravado, id est, that he would give him 150 l.
yearly for his Living. To which Mr. Weld sent this answer in Writing.

Sir, I received your liberal proffer of 150 l. per annum for my Living: But
that I may appear more kind to you then you are to your self, I make you this
proffer (and that under my hand, that if I go^ back, you may show it against
me) viz. You shall have all my Annual profits whatsoever for 100 l. per annum;
and if you and I come ^o confer about it, I Will fall yet lower; make trial of
it when you please.

Your loving Friend, Thomas Weld.


To this he received no answer; But after all, he and the rest went to Durham,
and gave it in upon their Oaths. That his Living was worth 150 l. and so they
told the Commissioners they effered him for it. All this is upon Record.

11^y. Then, still (to gratisie Mr. Weld. and make his House the more
comfortable to him*) after all his cost laid out upon the same (besides what
was given by the Commissioners, and the ^arish of Gatesh^ad toward it) to the
value of 100 l. (which (...) is for the good of all their succeeding Ministers,
as well as for himself) I say, to make his dwelling the more sweet and
comfortable, as a recompense for all his cost for the good of Posterity; they
(the 24 and the rest of the Subscribers to the Book) suffer a filthy dunghill
(even growing to a great mountain) where all their dung, garbage, and very
carryon is laid under his nose, and to his very door, to stink him, (if it may
be) out of his habitation; and after many requests made by him, they still let
it lie.

12ly. Last of all (to mention no more, though it might be endless almost to
set down all their injuri^us dealings) These very Church wardens (he
subscribers of this wretched Book) this last harvest (that no injury might be
left unat^empte^) sent to the Par^shioners and Mr. Welds Tenants, t^ pay him no
Tithe, nor Rent. And when some of the Tenants told them* they are tied by ^ond
to pay their Rent^: They ^ade answe^, They would ^eare them harmless.

A^l these affronte, losses and da^mages, has Mr. Weld patiently indu^ed for
the Gospel sa^e* fearing to harden their hearts though he knows well how easily
he could have right^^ himself) ^e having been often heard to say, That he
^op^d to win them by love at last.

But after all (to the great grief of his soul) he finds their ^earts more
and more hardened even to this day, against the Lord and him; and, that they
may declare this to the world to their own shame they set forth this miserable
Pamphlet, thinking to disgrace him, and all the Churches of Christ that walk in
the Congregationall ways; but the dishonor shall wo^ul^y (...) upon their own
heads, and God herein is just, to suffer themselves to vomit out their own
shame.

Yet such has been Mr. Welds love to this place, and the good people therein,
after all his sufferings from some, That when he was proffered lately (by his
Highness) his choice of two as eminent places as most are in all England; he
refused all to come again to this place.

Now let the Reader judge where the blame lies.

Yet again, that there be no mistake; let all know these ill dealings are not
to be imputed to all in Gateshead, for Mr. Weld counts dear to his soul many
in this place (as he has been often heard to say) not only those of his own
Church (whom these scorners say, that Mr. Weld calls only the godly party,)
but many others that fear the Lord, many of whom God has pleased to bless
his labors unto.

If shame and dishonor reflect upon the heads of these men, let them thank
themselves; for better is it that 100. such as they are should justly suffer
for their deserts, then one such as Mr. Weld should suffer unjustly, by their
malicious mouths and pens.

Now to touch upon some other things in this Learned pee^e.

First. Who but fantastical men would cu^ger up such bum^asted words, as,
Precentor, docked, oecunomie, Aversations, dispotically impellency,
con^esseration, embrocation ca^sticks, intimidate, fixation. Now whether the
absurdity of the Penner of the Book; or the pearking pride of the pretended
Authors are more discovered by such Language, I much question; for sure these
men, not being guilty of Learning, nor scarce able to Write true English; these
high-flowne words, as (all men know) could never be the brats of their own
brains: but they must tell the world, that they would feign be counted
Eloquent, though to attain this Honor, they show themselves Fools in Print.

Secondly, Who but profane and ignorant men, would dare throw such contempt
upon the Churches of Christ, as to call them, New ways of gathering Churches:
Mr. Welds new Church* a seminary of Schism, Contention, Division, Separation;
Mr. Welds new garb; Pragmaticall Model, like those dreamers in Jude, who
speak evil of things they know not. But we leave them to give account to the
Lord, for such hard speeches as these ungodly men have spoken against him,
Jude, ver. 8. 10. 10.

Thirdly. But Mr. Weld deni^s them a Lecturer to Preach and Adm^nister the
Sacraments?

Ans. How could that be, when they never presented any man to him that would
accept the work? Indeed they said, they would procure eit^er Mr Prideaux. Mr.
Cole, or Master Knight bridge; but instead of presenting any of these men, they
present a Paper to Mr. Wel^ to sub^cribe (as page 3. 4.) such a miserable and
ab^urd Paper (let the Reader per^^e and judge) that (^^ Mr. We^d ^old all them)
unless he had lost both his wi^^ and c^nscience, he durst n^^er yield to it.
For whereas Mr. W^ld has undertaken the charge of Preaching the Gospel, he
must (if he had subscribed the Paper) admit any whom the people should choose:
And such an one being c^osen, must be est^^lished when ever they desire it; and
when once settled* (let him Preach false Doctrine be scandal^u^ contentious,
etc.) Mr. Weld must continue him in that pl^^e, and must have no power at all
to hinder him by himself, or any other^* without all the peoples unanimous
consent: and this m^^t be Mr. Welds resolu^ion, and avowed consent, to r^tifi^
and c^^firme, whatsoever the said p^^ple shall think fi^* such an insnaring and
irrational Paper, would no wise, or so^er man ever have urged; and its a
Providence, that themselves should lay open their f^l^y, in Printing the Paper;
which gi^es Mr. Weld not so much po^er in his own place as the poo^est P^t-m^n
in the Parish; for he shall have his vote in the Electing and putting out a
Lecturer, when Mr. Weld him^el^e must have naught to do therein. Now this
simple Paner, Mr. Weld refusing to subscribe, they cry out. He absolu^el^
re^used to grant them a Lecturer; whereas he refused the Paper, not the
Lecturer.

Fourt^ly. But Mr. Weld fait^ful^y promised to grant the^ a Lectu^^r at the
ch^yc^ ^f the people; and afterward poss^^i^el^ denied to do it? (page 4)

A^s. Mr. Weld (being again consulted with about such promise) does profess
(as before the Lord) such a thought never came into his mind, much less, such
a promise, ever fell from his mouth; Its infinitely far from his judgment,
(all that know him can tell you) and as far from his practice: he stands amazed
at their brow of brass, who dare tell such an untruth to the world against
their Conscience. Its true, they desired of Mr. Weld, liberty for one to Preach
once in a m^neth, and give them the Sacrament; and said, it should be either
Mr. Prideaux, Mr. Cole, or Mr. Knightbridge, and no other: His answer was, If
s^; they should see there should be no obstructi^ns in him: but they never
brought any of them to him to this day. Yea, we hear from credible testimony
(who will avouch i^) that all these three men have utterly d^ni'd to accept the
motion. Yet these Churchwardens, ^oldly, wit^out blu^hing affirm, they found
them wi^^i^g They bend their tongues, like their bow, for lies; but have no
courage for the truth. ^er. 9. 4.

Fifthly But Mr. Weld r^f^seth to give them the Sacraments, though he be the
Minister of the place.

Ans. Yea, and good reason: Shall ignorant, pr^phane; swea^ers, and drunkards;
shall Liars and Scorners (as many of these that press for the Sacraments are)
be pertakers of these holy things, 1 Cor. 5. Rev. 21. 8. and 12. Mat. 15. 7. 1
Cor. 11. 28. 29. No* no stand back; must not ^eremiah sepa^ate the precious
from the vile? They speak of 1000. (...) I say if there were 10000. more, ^et a
minister cut off his right hand rather, then hold cut the h^ly Sea^es to such.
Its the weary burden of his soul, that so many of his people are unfit for
such Privileges.

Sixthly. But this monopolizi^g the Sacrament^, is to fill the ^^lly of
Coveto^snesse, and to sacrifice to the Diana of his own profit. page 11. 1^.

Ans. (A strange paradox,) Would not rather the giving the Sacraments to all,
bring in more profit? for then all his Ester B^oks, worth near 20 l. per annum,
would come in, of which now not one penny. Then would all their bounty appear
to such an Administrator* nothing would be too dear for such a minister. Did
not one of your selves lately (...) Mr Weld 5 l. per annum, if he would do
this w^rk, (though he abhors such base bribery;) and did not all the ^est ^ay,
Mr. Weld* upon this account, should have any thing what he would desire? Now
were not this the way to ^hrive? And yet, it seem^, they wanted matter to
render Mr. Weld as a man seeking his profit, when they cunger up an Argument so
contrary to common sense. And (I must tell you now) if he were a man that
sought his own profit, he would hardly have been persuaded to lay 104 l. about
his House, to leave it at the same day he leaves his place; nor quit (so
quietly) all his charge promised him about his settlement, nor bear the loss
of near 200 l. of your subscriptions under your own hands, when he know^ he
might so easily recover it: Nor would he have taken in a Lease of his Rectory,
which was 80 l. per annum (upon the complaint that through the fall of Corue,
they did lose by it) and let it pre^en^ly for 56 l. per annum* (as upon
consulting with master weld it did appear^) and as Christopher Sanderson, and
Charles M^daleton can testify, who were his Tennants. All which, i^ he had not
consulted the peace, and the progress of the Gospel, above his own gaire, he
would never have done. But to these men, I speak as the Prophet did to Doeg,
Psalm. 52. 2. 3. 4. Thy tongue d^^iseth mischiefs: like a sharp rasor, working
deceitfully. Thou l^vest (...) more then good; and lying rather then to speak
truth. Thou love all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue. Let such take
heed of the next verse. (^er. 5) it prove not their portion. But God shall
destroy thee for ever, and pluck thee out of thy dwell^ng pl^c^, etc.

Seventhly. But Mr. Weld Admin^sters the Sacraments, to none of his own Parish,
but to eight women, and two men.

Ans. If it were so, let these scorners know that ^en godly persons may weigh
in the balance against ten thousand others; and ten righteous men can more
prevail with God, then three Ci^ies, Genesis 19. 32. Yea, one Noah, one Moses,
one Elias. one Joshuab, one Job, are more in value then millions of s^^rners,
liars, and haters of Saints; yea, then the whole rabble world besides: And dos
these men then make ten godly persons such a cont^mptible number? When, in the
Arc (a Figure of Baptism) God himself put such a distinguishing character
upon the number of eight, 1 Pet. 3. 21.

Secondly. But do these men speak truth? or a malicious lie, in saying, there
were but ten persons Mr. VVeld Administers unto in Gateshead; whereas (truth
is) i^ there were but two more, there would be twenty; and yet Christ himself
did Administer the Lords Supper but to twelve, and here are eighteen even of
Gateshead, besides twice eighteen others: But these men's tongues are their own;
but the Lord shall cut out the tongue that speaks proud things, Psalm. 12. 3.
4.

Eighthly. But why does not Mr. Weld Publish his grounds for his New Church?
(page 11.)

Ans. Where were your ears (I marvel) when Mr. Weld (before ever he would
gather a Church) declared at large, at least in ten Sermons, (out of Acts 2.
41. to the end) many clear Scriptu^e grounds to prove the Congregationall way,
the mind of Christ: Yet these men still say, Why does not Mr. Weld publish his
grounds to the world? It seems they were either absent from Church, as too
often they are; or Napping, as he often takes them, when these truths were made
known.

Ninthly. But why does Mr. Weld cast us loose Stones? as page 18.

A^s. Oh that ye were but Stones* though loose Stones, for Gods Church is
called an House, and a Building, and Stones (though loose, lying scattered here
and there) are, yet* fit matter (when gathered together into one body) for a
building; and the godly themselves, till united by a holy giving up themselves
to the Lord, and hi^ people, as, 2 Cor. 8. 5. are but loose Stones; And do ye
(who are so far from the show of godliness) disdain to be called loose
Stones? I tell you, It^ a title too good, a term too high for such as are but
mi^^ and ^lay yea, rotten bones, and Straw fit for the D^ugh^ll, Isay 10. 6.
Isay 25. 10. Ezekiel. ^7. 1. 2. As for that scornful reproach they cast upon Mr.
Weld, as counting himself a Corner Stone; it were horrid presumption for him,
or any man so to do, that term being proper to Christ himself, (Psalm. 118.
22. 1 Cor. 3. 11. John 3. 10) and far from the spirit of Mr. Weld. I Will only
say of them, as its spoken of a man of their own cut, That he prated against
the Apostles with malitiou^ words, so do they against his faithful Ministers.
But as S^l^mon says, Pro. 10. 10. A pra^ing fo^le shall f^ll.

Tenthly. But they with much patience and moderation besought Mr. Weld, etc.
page 20.

Ans. If showing their teeth if spitting fire, if reviling, and if turning back
upon him, when he was answering of them, and con^incing of them; I^ these
things speak patience and modera^^on, then have they bin ^ull of these graces.
B^t oh that they kn^w what patience and moderation mean; (...) leave thus to
commend themselves when no g^o^ (...) kno^s them, will* can, or da^e do i^.

El^venthly See how fit for the Sacraments these men are (for be^ides all their
injurious, ungrateful, and malicious de^ling against Mr. Weld. and the many
gro^^e lies and slanders that run all along through the veins of t^i^ poo^
Book; and be^ides the scandals in their lives, all which, or any of which, were
enough to bar them from the Sacrament:) I say, b^^ide^ all these, do but take
notice of their p^ofound ignorance sh^wen in this Pamph^et (the naming whereof
is conviction en^ugh) viz.

As first. That the Sacrament should be A^ministred to all without di^tinction,
page ^0.

Second^y. That all in general. (for its taken by them pro ^^^^esso) ^re
qu^lified for the Sacrament, page ^1.

Thirdly. That every Minister ass^ming a Pastoral Charge, ought to administer
the Sacrament to all by the Laws of God and m^n.

Fourthly. That there is abo^e 1000 godly people in Gateshead (^or ^uc^ as
hun^er and thi^st after ri^hteousnesse, are g^atious, ^a^. 5. 6. Mat. 5. 3.
Psalm. 63. 2. Isay 63 2.) and th^s ^hey ^ffi^me of above a thousand souls in
this Parish.

Fif^h^y. Th^^ the Sacraments are the most transcendently effe^tu^^l
instrum^^ts for redeeming us from all iniquity and sin, p. 17. (oh the gross
ignorance and Popery) for this is only applycable to the blood of Christ, and
never attributed to the Sacraments, Ephesians. 1. 7. John 1. 17. Titus 2. 14. Now
if these men be not only profane, but so gross headed that they cannot
discern these common truths, which are obvious to every eye that is open; how
are they able to discern the Lords Body, which is more spiritual (for want of
which, they eat their own damnation:) yet they cry out for it, and Mr. Weld
must be hated, reviled, and reproached, because he will not give it.

That which follows, is a second Answer to the Book, by another Hand.
HAving Read a Pamphlet, lately put forth in the name of the Parish of
Gateshead, signed by the four Churchwardens, and Ralph Clavering, who by the
Pen of some Episcopal Spirit, have, in a vain vaunting style, heaped up very
many calumnies (and judging them so many Arguments) for promiseuous Parochyall
Administrations, against the Congregationall Church Way; I was provoked in my
spirit, both for the just Vindication of the holy ways of Christ, and for the
clearing of the name of that much wronged, though very useful servant of the
Lord Jesus, Mr. Weld, to discover the sinful pleas of that vain painted
Pamphlet. I shall only apply my self to that part of the Book, which consists
of twelve Sections, and fourteen Quaeries, considering that the other part,
being matter of fact, is faithfully, and fully answered before. In the
entrance into the Sections, you have this Title, Diotrephes; or, Altar contra
Altar. Its well known to any that have Read Smectymnum, against Bishop Hall,
or any other Presbyterian Writers, about that place of the 3 of John 8. 9. that
Diotrephes was not blamed for giving the Brethren their liberty in Church-votes
purchased by the death of Christ; nor denying those that were no Church-^embers
the peculiar rites of Ch^rches; but for usurping pre-eminence above his
Brethen; not that I conceive the Presbyterians grant the Brethren a Vote; but
to clear the ignorant app^ication of that Title to Mr. Weld, by them that
pretend, page 8. to know the judgment of all L^arned Divines: And for Altar
contra Altar, would they have their old Episcopal Altar up again? the book
smells rank of that design* but let them know, That as the gathering of the
Saints into a body, is no setting up an Altar, but, building an house for
Christ; so their Altar was long ago destroyed, at the pulling down of
Episcopacy; they knew who made it a place of lim^ and rubbish since.

In the first Section, you have them asserting three things. First, Their being
loath to perish tamely. Secondly, How Master Weld has raised their spleen.
Thirdly, What great seize they have reach^ in the mysteries of the
Gospel, and Divine Grace, and that upon account of their Baptism. To the two
first. I might justly Answer by way of Exclamation, Why will you dye! and why
will you dye in a rage! must you needs dye of the spleen? Friends when you
come to dye, c^ll to mind, that it is not the want of Sacraments will be your
ruin (for you would but have eat and drank your own damnation, if you had
them in the frame you are in) your ignorance of Christ, and opposition to him
will be your ruin, if the Lord do not change your hearts. For the third. Y^u^
gle^^i^g in your seize; First, you say, you are Proselytes of justice;
Do you know what you say or whe^eof you affirm? Read the description of
Proselytes of justice in Scripture, and then judge what you have said; they
were such as Cornelius, and the E^^uch, they were devou^ men, Acts 2. 5. chapter
10. 2. 7. ^en fearing God, Acts 13. 16. religious men, Acts 13. 43. Now
(Reader) if thou know the^e men, judge whether they be such Proselytes. As
for the seven Precepts of Noah given to the Proselytes of the ga^e, I wish they
either understood them, or practiced them; but pretenders will be high flowne.
But they speak of warmth, and gleames of grace that they have had; take heed
of lying to the holy Ghost; what means so much power of the stony heart, and
profane life, if there have been such meltings of Divine Grace? please not your
selves with words grace is a transforming thing.

2. The second Section cries up the old Laws of England, for promiscuous
Administrations; as if the house of Christ in Church work in times of
reformation, must be squa^ed and governed by old Statute Laws. I wonder what
Laws of 1 Edward 6. or 3 Edward 6. or 1 Elizabeth, established Presbyterian
Government, which these men pretend so much to; If you put these Laws in force,
you must have Bish^ps, and Spiritual Courts, and Common Prayer; but Onions and
Garlic will do enough with these men. And for the Scripture quoted to prove
Ministers bound to give the Sa^raments to all the Parish. Did ever the Apostles
write to a Parish Church? True, the Sacraments are indeed annexed to the Office
of a Minister, but to be dispensed only to the Flock of Christ: for that place
of Mat. 28 19. it is only for Baptism, not for the Lords Supper; and not for
Baptism to all, but to such as by ^eaching are first made Disciples, as the
Original word has it. For Ma^ke 14. 22. it is for Christ's giving the Supper
only to his Disciples; Are these men, and all the Parish such? are they all of
Christ's Family, and Disciples? for A^ts 2. 41. (another of their quoted
Scriptures) its spoken of Baptizing such as gladly received the Word. O that
these men, and the Parish of Gateshead were such! But is violent opposing the
Word, a glad receiving of it? And for Titus 1. 7. its full against them, for it
tells us the Duty of a Minister to be as Gods Steward; and if God^ Steward, he
must be faithful, as 1 Cor, 4. 1. 2. now faithfulness lies in dispencing what
provision is under his hand* to such of the Family as Christ his Master
commands, Now to whom will Christ have the Sacraments dispensed? why, let
himsel^e speak, Mat. 7. 6. Mat. 15. 26. Mat. 14. 2^. and let his Apostles
speak, Acts 2. 42. 1 Cor. 1. 28. really, such horrible abuse of the
Scriptures, is enough to make them blush. In this Section, you have many
fantastical words, pr^^entor, despetically, Pragmaticall model; but what is
their plea? That either Mr. Weld must give h^th the Sacraments to the Parish,
or else he acts contrary to the judgments of all Learned Divine,, and the
Constitutions of all Christian Churches. It pitties me to see, hujus farina
homin^s, to talk at this rate; were Dr. Ames, Mr. Cotton, Hooker, Shepherd,
Owen, Goodwin, Buroughs, etc. neither Divines, nor Learned? nay very many of
the godly Presbyterian M^ni^^ers give the Lords Supper but to a few in a
nu^erary Parish not to a hundred, where there is a thousand in the Parish. But
M. Weld acts like the Phylar^ha amongst the Jews. Ans. If you knew any thing
of Church Government, you would know. That Congregated Churches are not
modelled like Jewish Sa^h^d^im^. Christ will one day clear M. Weld of
Prag^aticalnesse, in distinguishing the precious from the vile, Ier. 15. 19.

3. The third Section pretends, That unless they offer violence to their
judgement^, they c^nnot Communicate with master Weld; or that the fault of
their not coming under the yoke of Christ l^y onel^ in their understandings.
But alas, their co^^upt w^lls, and carnal affections, makes them cast the
cords of Christ from them. But they will not give up their Eyes to the Pri^sts
in Sacrifice. Truly, I am so^e afraid, ^^^y have Eyes and see not; yet such
as they, would do well to give their Prie^^s their Eyes, who if they had their
wills, would only have blind guides, howe^er they think to get a name* by
pretending respects to some gracious Pres^yterian Ministers: Truly Friends,
you are so far from giving M. Weld your Eyes, that I am afraid you would be
more likely to p^^l out his Eyes, if you could.

4. In the fourth Section, they have the said plea in other words; O that they
would a little think of that of Christ, John 7. 17. If any man will do his
will, he shall know the Doctrine whether it b^ of G^d: men's vicious lives
corrupt their judgments; if their understa^dings be so good, as they wou^d
make the world believe, I heartily wish, their lives did express the truth of
that axiom, Volu^tus seq^itur dictamen int^llectus, if quoad exercitium only.
But master Mr. Weld quarrels, because you cannot believe many things which he
chances to believe: No Friends, you flatter your selves, and wrong him; his
controversy is, because you will not believe in Jesus Christ. And for your
saying, Mr. Weld chances to believe, how you chance to come by the faith you
have, I know not; but I am persuaded Mr. Weld his faith is of the operation of
God.

5. As to the fifth Section, where you would infinuate, Mr. Weld his not
obliging you to a compliance; Mr. Weld his obligations have been many to the
people of Gateshead; but dis-ingenuous spirits strive to shake off obligations;
but what ever ung^atefull men think, yet there are several precious ones in
Gateshead, who judge themselves for ever b^und to the Lord for his coming
thither. And for your shuffling interpretation of that command, Live peaceably
with all men; lay that of Hosea to heart* chap. 4. 4. This people are as they
that strive with the Pri^st: But they say, the command extends but to a Moral,
or Legal possibility. Friends, are you Morally or Legally incapable of
peaceablenesse? I^ it not possible for you quietly to wa^te till the Lord
fitted you for Sacraments, by some effectual work upon your hearts, and in
mean time be peaceable?

6. To your sixth Section, you affi^me, You have examined the grounds of the
Congregationall way. I believe your Conscience will fly in your face, and tell
you, how li^^^e you have examined the mind of God in those things; no, (I am
afraid) other things fill your heads, and hearts: If ever you intend to know
the platform of God, First read that of Ezeki^l with broken hearts. chap. 43.
10. 11. 12. and does the engagement to Jesus Christ, and his people, deter
you from Communion? I am sorry to see h^ly engagements affright you from
obedience to Christ. But Mr. Weld mad^ no Publication of his gathering a
Church. Sure Friends, the Penner of the Pamphlet (who ^ver it was) did not
advise with you about it: or else you could, and would have told him. That he
Preached at large, and that Publicly in Gateshead meeting place upon Genesis 2.
41, 42* 43. and that before the gathering of the Church; but here is not
ignorantia pura negation is, but prav^ dispositiones; I pray repent of this:
Yea, But he retarded a great while before he gathered the Church. Wonder not at
it, Churches of Christ are not made up of the rubb^sh of Parishes; he would
take time to know what stones were to be laid in the building: Churches are not
heaps* but made up of precious stones. And, for the bemoaning your stre^ghts,
it is but Gods hedging up your way, that you cannot have your other lovers,
Hosea 2. 6. 7.

7. The seventh Section is filled with ignorance and malice. Did Christ leave
his Body and Blood to be ^od under so^t by profane hearts? Symbola Chr^sti,
were never intended for a Linsey Wo^sey Contesseration; Mr. Weld is more tender
of the dear blood of his Christ* and of poor souls, then to let the people
eat and drink their damnat^on; And for the ^^nful* slanders o^ the good ways
of God, calling them, a S^m^nary of Sch^sme, etc. this is the old Popish a^arum
against all Reformation. And for your Monopoly, I would desire you to learn
That a Church is a City gathered out of the World, with its spiritual
Privileges ap^rop^iated to it, Ephesians. 2. 10. You close the Section with a very
fal^e charge of Ambition, and Covetous^esse, as the Principles of Independency.
But his Friends know, and his Ene^ies might know, how many reproaches, and what
inj^ries in h^s maintenance h^ has suffered, upon the naked account of
gathering a Church in Christ's way: Surely, he sat down and considered what
virulent, and violent calumni^s he should meet with by following Christ in this
way, which he now finds.

8. This eighth Section is f^ll of the Serpents venom and bitterness. The
Violence and Oppression exercised toward him in p^int of maintenance, might
have st^pt the mouth of those clam^^r^, if it had been confidered: And if the
Church (over which h^ is Ove^-seer) do endeavor in his suffering, upon their
ac^^unts* to encourage him in his multiplied labors of frequent Exercises and
Administrations* let not your Eye be evil, because theirs is good. I wonder
you should call gathering a Church out of a pr^miscuou^ multitude, plurality of
Livings. Do not even the godly Presbyterians so? Do not many of them leave
ou^ the far greater number of the Parish? If argumentum ad hominem would
prevail, this might do.

9. Ninth Section, Here appears much unmannerly reviling of a Reverend Minister
of the G^spel, whom you charge with personal contumacy. Oh Friends, Why has
Satan filled your Hearts? But what is the matter? Mr. Weld will not break
Spiritualll Bread with the Parishioners; Is this personal contumacy, that he
will not let the unclean into the Temple? That he will not let the Goats into
the Fould of Christ? But it break^ the Peace of the generallity of the People.
We had better want peace, then Crucify the Lord Jesus afresh; What! prostitute
the Body of Christ to keep peace wirh profane men; Read Luke 12. 49

10. Tenth Section. What Mr. Welds Call was, you have at large declared to you,
which, in truth, was a good hand of Providence, for the stopping of the mouths
of unreaso^able men. And for their quoting the Statute of 13. Elizabe^h^ they
forget, they profess themselves Presbyterians, a thing Queen Elizabeth and
her Council could not bear. Were the Laws of Episcopal Administrations a
bu^then to the non-conformists then? and shall we be brought under those yokes
now? And for receiving the maintenance arising from ^he place* he has a
warrant from Christ, 1 Cor. ^ 14 The Lord has ord^ine^, that they which Preach
the Gospel* should live of the Gospel. But to Answer to the tenure of your
Quaerie, that he is bound to Administer the Sacraments; then, I ^ay there are
upon twenty members of the Church who are Inhabitants of Gateshead, to whom the
Lord has abu^dantly blessed his Ministry, to whom he does Administer; and
does not he herein perform the spiritual ministrations in Gateshead? But you
charge him with an un^heologicall plea. I pray you give me leave to ask you
four Churchwardens, which of you have been Bapti^ed into the profession of
Theology, or matr^culated into any University; but I am apt to think, that you
plowed with a Theological Heyfer, who might have expounded this Riddle to you,
that not to give the Sacrament to all the Parish, is no deprivation of a
Ministers maintenance.

11. Eleveth Section. Here you have a fardle of fine spun words, and an heap
of railing. Know Friends, That those that can neither make faith in Christ, nor
holiness in conversation, shall never go (notwithstanding their pretended
wedding garment of Baptism) in the day of trial, for a Spouse of Christ. I
wish you remember, That for all the Jews pretense, to bring a Church upon the
account of an initiating Ordinance; yet they were not let into the Church of
Christ, without pricking at the Heart by the Word. Could Mr. Weld see you
pricked at the Heart, how dear and welcome would you be to him? You tell him of
Embro^ation, Caustickes, and Excision; sure you would tell the world what
Empericks you are; but if you have any Latin* remember, That immedicabile
vulnus anse reciden^um est. And for his Excommunicating a thousand souls; he
professes to have nothing to do in point of censures with them that are
without. No, no, your being Parishioners of Ga^es^ead ^ath no Scripture warrant
to make you members of a Church of Christ: it is not habitation makes a Spouse
of Christ. How many Enemies of Christ lived in Jerusalem where the Church
lived, and were not members? Shall Papists, and Atheists pre^end, because they
dwell in Gat^shead, to be Church Members? That gross untruth of there being
but ten I^habitants in Gateshead, members of his Church, is fu^ly answered
before.

12. Twelfth Section. Here you have the business of the L^cturer to be imposed
upon Mr. Weld. Let me a little open the unreasonablenesse of this Proposal,
let any gracious, sober Minister of the Presby^erian judgment put but this
case, Whether he having gathered the best of the People of his judgment out of
his Parish for Fellowship and Communion in the Lords Supper, that if the
remainder that lie still in their ignorance and opposition (to whom he neither
can, nor will Administer the Lords Body) should desire a Minister beside
himself in that place to give them the Sacrament at the accustomed times, as
they here express it? Whether (I say) he would think it reasonable that they
had their desires? this is Mr. Weld his case. Secondly. Look but to the
Assurance required about placing a Lecturer, p. 5. where it is demanded, that
Mr. Weld give it under his hand never to meddle in the choice or removeall of
the Lecturer, what ^v^r h^ may prove. Were there ever such Iron yokes put upon
a Reverend Minister of Christ? and yet, what reproache^ did Mr. Weld (upon the
sober reasoning in this case) meet with as these men's hands?

I come now to examine the Quaeries; only first, I beg a word to those that
are looking after God in Gateshead, and are not yet Church Members, whom I know
detest having any hand or consent in this sinful Pamphlet. I humbly desire
God, that the stumbling-blocke that these men have cast in their way, may not
in any manner prejudice their spirits against the Gospel.

To your first Quaerie, I answer, That Jesus Christ in his providentiall
committing the care of souls to men, does not authorize the Minister to
prostitute his precious Body and Blood to the profane and ignorant; nor
expects he should dispense privileges to those that will not come under the
yoke of Christ. If Mr. Weld have faithfully revealed the whole counsel of God
to the people of Gateshead (as I verily believe he has) and if he dispense the
Sacraments to those that come under the order of the Gospel, then he may
comfortably appear in the day of his accounts; only let me desire you to
study that place you quote, Heb. 13. 17. and think your so often grieving of
him, how unprofitable it will be to you in that great day.

To your second quaerie. Wherein you cry up the greatness of Sacramental
mysteries. I answer, That the reason why M. Weld dare not Administer Baptism
and the Lords Supper to the profane multitude, is, because they are such
glorious mysteries; Procul este prophani: Shall they that cannot discern the
Lords Body partake of it? As for your calling the Sacraments, Instruments of
redeeming you, you speak ignorantly, the Blood of Christ only can redeem.
Where are Sacraments said, to red^eme? Did the Bread, or Wine, or Water dye for
us? Seals they are of the Covenant of Grace, and so to be dispensed to those
that are in Covenant. And whereas you call them purifying, know that polluting
of Ordinances, it not the way to purify hearts.

To your thir^ (...)* as for denying the Sacraments to the multitude; what ever
be the event, he walks by the rule of distinguishing the p^^t^ous from the
vile. And for your fears, surely the withholding them from the ignorant, is a
more likely means to bring them to a sight of their unworthiness, then the
letting them eat and drink their damnation, whereby (if infinite me^cy did not
step betwixt) they would be sea^'d to destruction

To the fourth quaerie, the discipline of Christ is part of the faith once
delivered to the Saints, this distinguishing carriage to saints and others,
has Scripture, Precept, and Pract^ce for it; one pi^ce of Christ's last will
was, to observe all that he commanded us.

To your fifth qu^. That of Christ, Mat. 18. 17 is spoken of a particular
Church to whom he has committed the power of censures; and a^ for the
Parishioners that are not gathered into the Church; the Church neither does nor
can exercise power over them, they leave them to stand or fall to the Lord. And
for members acting singly* there is no such thing in Church work; but I am
ready to bele^ve, that the Compos^^ of these Quaeries, is not much acquainted
either with the Principles and Practice of the Church way; or with the mind of
Christ.

Your sixth quaerie would persuade the world, That it is only your difference
in judgment keeps you out; when alas, they that know you, know it is your
^gnorance of the Lord Jesus, and your loose conversations keep ^ou out; ask no
more Whether it be Mr. Welds care or kindness, it is his faithfulness to
Christ that keeps you out.

Your seventh quaerie is the same with the sixth only you ask further W^ether
Mr. Weld his damning of you be matter of conviction. Take heed, his frequent
plain, and faithful dealing with you in his Public Ministry, denouncing wrath
to impenitent sinners, do not rise up in judgment against you. Will ye not
hear the Law? see that of Isay 30. 9. 10. 11. This is a rebelliou^ people,
lying children, children that will not hear the Low of the Lord. Which say to
the Seers, See not, speak unto us smooth things.

To the eighth q^aerie, Jesus Christ has told you, That his Ministers have
power to bind and loose; was it not usual for the Apost^es to intimidate their
prey (as you scorners speak) by declaring the greatness of the peoples sin,
and the wrath of God due to it, Acts 2. 36. 37. 16. 30. to let people
understand the authority Christ has invested his Ministers with. For your
being lead into temptation, there is no great fear of your having Mr. W^lds
person in admiration, who so vigorously sets himself against your sins.

To the ninth quaerie* Mr. W^ld his naming the common multitude of the Parish
loose S^ones, was in reference to the dispensing of Privileges which belong
only to the Church of Christ, which is built up a spiritual house. You still
dream, He longs for your fixation in the Church over which he is a Pastor;
alas, you would be burdensome Stones* and Stones of offense in it* never
think that such unhewne stones are fit for Christ's building, or shall ever be
acceptable to Mr. Weld* or that Church.

To the tenth q^a^ie, Know that Preaching the Gospel to the people, is the
great work he was sent to do, 1 Cor. 1. 17. The Commissioners at White hall,
do not send men to give the Sacraments; but only to Preach* leaving them to
their light in the Lord, as to other Administrations; nay promiscuous
Communion, is an offense to them. And, for his mainten^n^e for Preaching the
Gospel, what says Paul, 1 Cor. 9. 14. The Lord bath ordained, that those which
Preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel. Besides, your Consciences cannot
but bear him witness* that he faithfully declared at his first coming, That
he could not Administer till he saw you fit; and this you all accepted of. And
for denying his Tithes, you show your spirits and affections toward him; bu^
the Law must be your Rule, and not your Will.

To your eleveth quaerie. It speaks much froath and Atheism, the Lord will one
^ay declare, who are the Sheep and the Goats. Reproaching of the goldy is the
brand of scorners; No matter whether any other Religion can make expiation for
the failings of saints, so the blood of Christ do it; but know, that your
revilings, God takes notice of; and scorners are the worst of sinners, as Psalm.
1. 1.

To the 12. If your irregular proceedings in your Offices make good men shake
off your yoke, thank your selves; whilst you do cry up Saints for seemingly
holy, its sad, you do not so much as pretend to holiness. And whilst you
compare others to Absalom, consider who are the rebellious childr^n, Isay 30.
10. whilst you strive to divest the good old man, you^ iniquities have found
you out.

To the thirteenth. Alas, your land marks are usurpations, ^^akes of your own
fixing, no plants engrasted by the Law, and no marvel if they be so easily
pulled up; its not fit such brambles should Rule, that scratch and tear their
Neighbors.

To the fourteenth. To see an holy life, and gu^sse at future hypocrisies,
shows little Christian Charit^; he that begun a good work in them, will
perfect it to the end, Phil. 1. 6.

Reader, I have bin the shorter in Answer to the Quaeries, because they are
generally the former calumni^s raked up into Questions; and here I might put
many anti-quaeries. Only a word to the P^n^er, before I take off my Pen.

Friend, If thou bee^^ a Christian indeed, I Will assu^e thee, this pleading for
wickedness, to weaken the hands of a faithful Minister of Christ, and hearden
the hearts of the profane, will cost thee much running to the B^ood of Christ,
and some tears, before thou dyest. The foul blots thou have ca^t upon the
Churches of Christ, and Mr. W^ld, must be washed out I assure thee. If thou
be not a Saint, then it had been better for thee, that a mill*stone were
hanged about thy neck^, and thou thrown into the Sea, then that thou should
offend, not one, but many little ones; thou have treasured up wrath against the
day of wrath; the Lord ^ay not this sin to thy Charge.

FINIS.
