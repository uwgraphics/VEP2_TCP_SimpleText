The vocacyon of Ioha^ Bale to the bishopric of Ossorie in Irela^de his
persecucio^s in ye same / and final delyueraunce.

The English Christian / The Irishe Papist.


God has delivered me from the snare of the hunter / and from ye noisome
pestilence. Psalm. xcj. If I must needs rejoice / I will rejoice of mine
infirmytees, ij. Cor. xj. The preface.
Johan Bale to ye folowers of Christ's Gospel.
FOr three consyderacyons chefely (dear brethren) have I put fourth this
treatise of my vocacyon to the church of Ossorye in Irela^de / of my hard
chau^ces therein / and of my fynall deliverance by the great goodness of God.
Ossorie
The first of them is / for that me^ should well know / that the office of a
Christen bishop / is not to loyter in blasphemouse papistrie / but purely to
preach ye Gospel of God / to his christened flock. ye flock
The second is / that they should also understand / that contynuall
persecucyons / and no bodyly welthe / does follow the same most godly office /
in them which truly executes it. The third is / that they might behold how
gracyously our most merciful God with his power wayteth upon them / and
finally delyuereth them in most deep dangers. Deliverance.


These.3. things notable / concerning the elect members of Gods congregacyon
in this life / comprehends much matter in the scriptures of both testamentes
/ with abundaunce of examples from Abel the first to Johan the eua^gelyst /
which was the last liver in the same. The examples also thereof are both lively
and innumerable / Examples
in the first propagacion and long contynuaunce of the christen church from
his time to this our time / as the chronycles and hystoryes most abundauntly
specifieth.

First / as concerning the examples of holy scripture. Jesus. Adam.
Jesus the eternal son of the everlasting father / in the Godhede preached
to Adam in paradyse terrestre / and constytute him so well an instructour as a
father over his posteryte. He proved him also after he had sinned / by diverse
afflyctyons / and finally promised both to him and to his / deliuerau^ce in the
sede of the woman / which at the lattre in his own person he lovingly
performed. Christ
Christ ye seyde son of God contynually still taught / by the mouths of the
fathers and prophets / till such time as he himself came in the flesh. Than
was he above all others / of his heavenly father appointed / a universal
doctor over all the world / and commanded to be heard / Math. iij. Adoctor
He followed his vocacyo^ in most ample wise / very cruelly was he of the
clergy tha^ persecuted / and gloriously delivered in his ressurection from
death. The members of his true church / the prophets and Apostles / were in
case like as he their head was / first called / than afflicted / and gracyously
always in the end delivered. Fathers
He that shall mark the laboriouse procedinges of Abraham / Joseph / and
Moses / of David / Helyas / and Daniel / with the other old fathers and
prophets / shall find it no less. He like wise that shall dyscretely search
the doings of Peter / James and Johan / with the other of the Apostles and
dysciples / shall well perceive the same.

Hieremye for the old law / Paul for the new law / and Johan Baptyst
betwixt them both / were called from their mothers womb to that heavenly
office of preaching. Hier. j. Called.
Luce. j. Gala. j. yea / they suffered extreme persecucyons under tyrauntes /
and finally were delivered / in this life from parelouse dangers* and in
death / from sin / hell / and da^pnacyo^. To rehearce the examples of the
primatyue church / and of the ages following / Ages.
concerning these matters / it would require much time / they are so many /
and therefore at this present I omit the^. Thus a^ I not alone in these 3.
matters of vocacio^ / persecucion / and deliuerau^ce / but have on my side an
infinyte no^bre of examples. Which makes me the more a great deal to rejoice /
like as I wish them to do / The author.
which have in these troublouse days the like. Neither am I ashamed to tell my
brethren / what God has most graciously done for me / nomor tha^ s. Paul was
for himself in his own Epistles / and Luke in ye acts for saint Peter /
though I be far unlike them. s. Peter
For I fare like the bird which is delivered from the snare of the catcher. He
flies to a bough / and rejoices in his delyueraunce / and even so do I. In
the which rejoice / I make not only my self merye / but also all my louinge
frindes. And as for my cruel enemies the papists / papists
if I make them sorye in the rehearsal of my delyueraunce / I am not ill apayde
thereof. For it is better (they say in Northfolke) that young lyddernes weep /
than old men. I call them young and not old / for God is oldar than Satan /
if age may be attributed to his eternyte / Daniel
as Daniel says it may / and Christ oldar than the deuyls vycar at Rome /
their ungracious father.

As we are in most things contrary to these papists / so have we reioyces
contrary to theirs. papists
They rejoice in health / prosperity / riches and worldly pleasures for their
bellies sake.

We in our infirmytees / afflictions / losses / and sorrowful crostes / for
Christ's veritees sake. And thus may we well do / and boast of it also without
offense / for so ded the forenamed S. Paul. s. Paul
2. Cor. 11. and earnestly willed us to be his folowers. Phil. 3. first he
boasted of his vocacion / and said. God sorted me out and appoi^ted me from my
mothers womb / and also he called me by his grace / to preach his lively
gospel among the heathen / Gal. 1. what if I should in like case boaste / yt
he by his grace had also called me in this age / to preach the same Gospel to
the Irishe heathens / wc never heard of it before / to knowledge? Irishe.
I should not do other wise than the truth is. For I was put to it against my
will / by a most christen king / and of his own mere mocion only / without
suit of fryndes / mede / labor / expensis / or any other sinistre mean else.
By his Regal power and authorite / which both were of God / Edward
To. 13. was I both allowed and confirmed / and not all vnioyfully received of
ye people / which causes me in conscience to judge my vocacio^ just. Yet was
not my rejoice so much in ye dignite thereof / as in doing for the time / the
office theru^to belonginge. Office.
But now is it most of all in the leauinge of that bishopric / the Gospel
being so unthankfully of the prestes received / I so terribly of them
persecuted / and my servants so cruelly slain.

S. Paul.
Moreover saint Paul boasted much of his persecucions / and described them at
large / concludinge thus in ye e^de / Very gladly (says he) will I rejoice of
my weakness / yt the strength of Christ may dwell in me. Therefore have I
dilectacio^ in infirmitees / in rebukes / in needs / in persecucion / and
anguyshes / for Christ's sake. The Author.
2. Cor. 12. If I have like wise / felt a great meanie of the same afflictions
/ as I have done in deed / may not I also with him rejoice in them? May I not
be glad / that I am in sorrows for the Gospel / like fashioned to him / and
not pranked up in po^pe and pleasures / like ye wanto^ babes of this world? As
at this day is lecherouse Weston / weston.
which is more practiced in the art of breche burninge / than all ye whores of
the stues / to the great infamye of his virginal order. The truth of it is /
that sens I took that wayghtie office in hand / I have been sick to the very
death / I have been grieved with the untowardness of ministers.

Troubles.
I have been in iournayes and labors / in iniuryes and losses / in peines and
in penuries. I have been in strifes and contencions / in rebukynges and
slaunderynges / and in great danger of poyseninges and killinges.

I have been in parell of the heathen / in parell of wicked prestes / in parell
of false justices / in parell of trayterouse tenauntes / in parell of cursed
tyrauntes / in parell of cruel kearnes and galloglasses. Tyrauntes.


I have been in parell of the sea / in parell of shypwrack / in parell of
throwynge over the boorde / in parell of false brethren / in parell of
curiouse searchers / in parell of pirates / robbers and murderers / and a
great sort more.

Sanct Paul also rejoiced / that God had so miraculously delivered him from so
many daungerouse ieopardyes / Parels.
and spares not so to report them. 2. Cor. 11. et. 12. Why should I than
shrink or be ashamed to do the like / having at Gods hand the like
miraculouse deliverance? Are they not left to us for example / that we should
do the like when we feel the like? Written.
Whatsoever things are written before time (says he) they are written for our
learning / that we through pacyence and confort of the scriptures might have
hope* Romans xv. He in the city of Damascon / bei^ge laid wait for / by ye
liefe tenant of King Aretha / was let down at a window in a basket / and
so escaped his hands. Act. ix. dubline.
I i^ ye city of Dubline / bei^ge assaulted of papists / was co^uayed away
in ye night in mariners apparel / and so escaped ye danger by Gods help.
When Paul's death was sought by certain Jews at Jerusalem / the upper captain
there / commanded ij. under captains / i^ the night to conveye hi^ to Cesarea
with 200. souldyers.70. horsemen / Cesarea
and 200. speareme^ / and so to to deliver him. Acts. 23. In lycke case / wha^

Kilkennye.
the good suffren of kylkennie with a^ hundred horsemen / and 300. foteme^
brought me thither in the night and so delivered me that time.

As Paul against his will / was put into a ship of Adramitiu^ / coupled
with other prisoners of Iewrie / co^uaied fourh into Italy / and there safely
delivered. Italy.
Act. 27. and 28. So was I and my companyo^ Thomas against our wills taken
i^to a ship of Zela^de / coupled with french prisoners / co^uayed forth i^to
flanders / and so at the lattre / safely there delivered. As their ship was
caught betwixt Candia and Melita / and could not resyste the wyndes / ye wind
so was ours betwixt Mylforde haven / and Waterforde. As they had an exceeding
tempeste upon the sea / so had we likewise. As they were without hope of
sauegarde / so were we also.

As they feared Syrtes or daungerouse sandy places and rocks / so ded we. As
they were almost famyshed and drowned / so were we. Comfort.
As God conforted them / so ded he us. As they were in conclusion cast into an
ylande / so were we into S. Iues in Cornewale. As the people showed the^
kyndnesse at Melita / so ded they us at the said S. Iues. As Paul gave thanks
and brake bread among them / so ded we also. As the captain Julius
courteously entreated him and gave him lyberte to go unto his fryndes at Sydon
/ and to refreshe him / Julius.
so ded our captain Cornelis use us very ge^tilly with all favor and lyberte
/ what though he had so currishely and cruelly entreated us before. As Paul was
stonge of a bytyng vyper and not hurt / so was I of that viperous Walter being
most unjustly accused of treason before ye justices there / Walter
and yet through Gods deliuerau^ce / not hurt. As he appealed to Caesar / so
ded I to the trone of God.

As great dyspycyo^s were among the Jews at Rome concerni^g Paul / Rome.
so were there afterward among the shyppers in our return to their ship
concerning us. As the souldyers gave counsel to kylle the prisoners / so were
there some of our men that gave counsel to have drowned us for our money /
and of some to have delivered us up to the counsayll of England / in hope of
great rewards. Publius.
As Publius gentilly received Paul / and by him was healed of all his dyseases
/ so ded mine host Lambert receive me also gentylly / and by me was delivered
from his vain believe of purgatory / and of other Popysh peltryes. As the
people reported Paul to be a murderer / and after changed their minds / and
said he was a God / A God.
so our wicked maryners reported me to be a most heinous traitor / and yet
afterward in my delyueraunce called me the servant of God. As he was for the
hope of Israel led i^to captivity / and at last delivered / so was I also for
the same captiued / and in fine delivered into Germany. Brethren.
As the brethren met Paul with rejoice at Appij forum / so ded they me in
diverse parts of Duchelande / and lawded God for my so miraculouse
deliverance. As he said that he had committed nothing against the law of his
fathers / so say I also that I have in this act committed nothing against the
Apostels and Prophets doctrine / I thank my Lord God thereof. The author.
Thus had I in my troublous iournaye from Irelande into Germanye all those
chau^ces i^ a manner that S. Paul had in his iournaie of no less trouble / from
Jerusalem to Rome / saving that we lost not our ship by the waye^

exclude I my self / but I vttre it also for my exyled brethren / of whom a
great nombre is at this time in Germany / Denmarcke / and Geneua. For others.
The true church of God had never sumptuouse hospitalles any long time
together but very simple cottages and caves / if ye mark the sacred hystoryes
and au^cyent cronicles. The plesau^t possession / Possessions.
and gorgious dwelling places / have euermor remained to ye glorious Epicures /
ye very enemies always of Christ's gospel. We are not now to learn how to take
these our present afflictions in good part / for we know them before hand /
and have had them long time / as it were in an exercise. Exercise
Nether are we all barayne of frindely receptacles / for the heavenly doctrynes
sake / though our adversaries in England with violence throw stones at us /
and seek utterly to destroy us. They are truly much deceived which thinks
the Christen church to be a political commen welthe / church
as of Rome and Constantinople / mayntayned by humayne polyces / and not by the
only wurde of God. Such are they which now have the doings in these present
controuersyes / and oppress the most manifest verite. God amend it.

I write not this rude treatise / for that I would receive praise thereof / but
that I would God to have all the praise / which has been a most wonderful
wurker theri^. Praise.
For I am but a clodde of coruption / felinge in my self as of my self /

the Christen church to be more greuouse i^ those days / than it was to the

what would he have said if he had seane the abominable ydolatries of our time

and disgested / they are immediately resolved into corruption. Yea / Christ
says / Christ.

Britain in yt age / Aruiragus, Marius, Coillus, Lucius, Peace.

These like laysye locustes spra^ge fourth of the pytt bottomless. They served
God in lyberte / and were fed of their own true labors. These served
Antichrist in bondage / and devoured up the labors of other. They were sumwhat

Boniface, Wilfride, Du^stane, Oswolde, La^franck, Anselme, and such other
without no^bre / by who^ ye sincere faith of the English church decayed. These
were bitter sti^gars i^ Antichrists cause / yea / terrible accusers and
supressers of kings and of other christian magistrates. accusers
These caused ye su^ne / wc is ye clear verite of ye lord / to apere as sack

fantastical doctrines / vain tradicions / and supersticiouse ordinances.
Obscurers.
So that they made Gods heavenly wurde / to seem to the people / dark / rough
/ hard / and unpleasant / for their idle bellyes sake.

Yet deny I it not / but some godly men were among them in those days. As
Beda, Johan of Beuerle, Alcuinus, Neotus, Hucarius, Serlo, Achardus, Ealredus,
Alexander Neckam, Doct.
Nigellus, Seuallus, and such other. Which though they tha^ erred i^ many
things / yet was not their error of obstinacy and malice. Than followed the
schole doctors with the.iiij. ordres of frires / very wicked kinds of men /

and they with their sophistical sorceryes / poysened up altogyther / clearly
ouerthrowi^ge the Christen church / and settinge up in her place the most
filthye sinagoge of Satan. In that malignaunt assemblye / were false
wurshippinges commanded for Gods holy service / and monstruouse buggery for a

Thus were ye people nus^ed up from their yowth in calling upon dead me^ and
images / the preastes and religiouse in the mean time occupied / in all
beastly wurkes of ye flesh. I have the registre of ye visitacio^s of ye
cloisters of England / and therefore I know it to their co^fusio^. Registr.
The monks before their time / ded no more but mixte the Christian religion with

Yet were there always some in that miste of palpable darkness / yt smelled

I pass over my earnest refusal thereof / a month after that / in the kings

In beholdynge the face and order of that city / I see many abhomynable

Upon the purificacion day of our lady / the lord chancellor of Irelande /
sir Thomas Cusake / Chancellor.
our special good lord and earnest ayder in all our procedinges / appointed
us to be invested or consecrated / as they call it / by George the archbishop
of Dublyne / Thomas the bishop of Kyldare / and Vrbane ye bishop of Duno
assisinge him. I will not here describe at large the subtyle co^ueyau^ce of
that great Epicure ye archbishop / G. Brown.
how he went about to diffarre the day of our consecracion / that he might by
that means have prevented me / in taking up the proxyes of my bishopric to
his own glottonouse use / and in so depriuinge me of more tha^ half my
living for that year. As we were coming fourth / to have recciued the
imposicion of hands / Lockwode.
according to the ceremonye / Thomas Lockwode (Blockheade he might well be
called) the deane of the cathedral church there / desired the lord
chau^cellour very instauntly / yt he would in no wise permyt ye obseruacion to
be done after ye book of consecratinge bishops / wc was last set fourth in
England by act of parliament / A trait.
alleginge yt it would be both an occasion of tumulte / and also that it was
not as yet consented to by act of their parliament in Irelande. For why / he
much feared the new changed order of the communion therein / to hindre his
kychin and bellye. The lord chancellor proponed this matter unto us. The
archebisshop consented thereunto / so ded the other.ij. bishops. A Beast
Maistre Goodaker would gladly it might have been otherwise / but he would not
at that time contend there with them.

When I see none other way / I stepped fourth / and said. ye author
If England and Irelande be under one king / they are both bound to ye
obedience of one law under him. And as for us / we came hither as true
subjects of his / sworn to obey that ordinance. It was but a bisshopprick
(I said) that I came thydre to receive that day. An oath
Which I could be better contented to tread under my foot there / than to
break from that promise or oath yt I had made. I bad them in the end / set
all their hearts at rest / for came I ones to the church of Ossorie / I would
execute nothi^ge for my part there / (...) accordi^ge to ye rules of ye lattre
book. With (...) lord chau^cellour right honorably co^mau^(...) ye ceremony
to be done after ye book. Tha^ (...) asseheaded deane a way more tha^
halfeco^f(...) Neither followed there any tumulte among the people / but every
man sauinge the prestes / was well contented. A loiterer.
Than went the archbishop about that obseruacion / very vnsauerly and as one
not much exercised in that kind of doing / specially in the administracion
of the lords holy supper. In the end the lord chancellor made to us and to
our friends / a most friendly diner / to save us from exceeding charges / which
otherwise we had been at that day.

An ague
Within.ij. days after was I sick again / so egerly / that no man thought I
should have lived / which malladie held me till after Eastre. Yet in the mean
time / I found a way to be brought to kylkennie / where as I preached every
sunday and holy day in lent / till the sunday after Eastre was fully past /
never felinge any manner of grefe of my syckenesse / for the time I was in the
pulpet. Gods wurke.
Whereat many men / and my self also greatly merualed. Neither had I for all ye
time space / any mind to call for any te^porall profits / which was
afterward to my no small hynderaunce. From that day of our consecracio^ / I
traded with myself / by all possybylyte to set fourth that doctrine / doctrine
which God charged his church with / ever sens ye beginning. And thought
therwt in my mind also / A trait.
yt I had rather that Aethna ded swallowe me up / tha^ to mai^teine those ways
in religion / which might corrupt the same. For my daily desire is / in ye
euerlasti^ge schole / to behold the eternal son of God / both here and
after this life. And not only to see the fathers / fathers.
prophets and Apostles theri^ / but also for love of ye doctrine / to enjoy
their blessid feliship herafter. And so much the rather I traded thus with
myself / yt I see than the kings majesty / ye arhebishopp of Canterbury /
and the honorable lords of ye counsel / so ferue^tly bent ye way / as to
seek ye peoples health in ye same. Health.
I thought it thereupon no less tha^ my bound dewtie / to show my self
faithful / studiouse / and dilligent in yt so chargefull a function.

My first procedinges in yt doi^ge / were these. I earnestly exhorted ye people
to repe^tau^ce for sin / and required the^ to give credit to ye Gospel of
salvation. ij. principles.
To acknowledge and believe yt there was but one God / and him alone without any
other / sincerely to worship. One Christ
To confess one Christ for an only sauer and redemer / and to trust i^ none
other ma^nis prayers / merits / nor yet deserui^ges / but in his alone / for
salvation I treated at large both of ye heavenly and political state of ye
christian church / and helpars I found none among my prebe^daries and clergy
/ but adversaries a great no^bre. I preached the Gospel of ye knowledge and
right inuocacion of God / I mayntened the political order by doctrine /

and moved the co^mens always to obey their magistrates. But wha^ I ones
sought to distroye the ydolatries / and dissolve the hypocrites yockes / than
followed angers / slau^ders / co^spiricyes / and in the end the slaughter of
men, Much a do I had with the prestes / for yt I had said among other / Idols.
yt the white Gods of their maki^ge / such as they offered to the people to
be worshipped / were no Gods but ydoles / and that their prayers for the dead
procured no rede^pcio^ to the solwes departed / Redemption of sowles being
only in Christ / of Christ / and by Christ. I added yt their office by
Christ's straight commandment / Preachinge.
was chifely to preach / and instruct the people in the doctrine and ways of
God / and not to occupy so much of the time in chauntynge / pypynge / and
singing.

Much were the prestes offended also / for yt I had i^ my preachi^ges / Wives
willed the^ to have wives of their own / and to leave the unshamefast
occupienge / of other me^nes wives / daughters / and servants. But hear what
a^swere they made me always / yea ye most viciouse me^ among the^. What should
we marry (said they) for half a year / and so loose our livings. Think ye
not yt these men were ghostly inspired? Deuylish.
either yet had knowledge of some secret mischefe wurki^ge in England? I for
my part have not a little sens yt time marueled / wha^ it has fallen to my
remembrance. Well ye truth is / I could never yet by any Godly or honest
persuasion / bring any of the^ to marriage / Adulterers.
neither yet cause them which were known for unshamefast whorekepers / to
leave that filthy and abhomynable occupyenge what though I most earnestly
labored it. But sens that time I have considered by the judgment of the
scriptures / that the impenytent ydolatour must therewith be also a fylthie
adulterer or most detestable sodomite. Sodomites.
It is his just plage. Romans 1. We can not stop it. Like wise the dissemblinge
hipocrite / in co^temning Gods truth / must needs follow errors and lies in
the doctrine of deuyls. 1. Timot. 4. to have in ye end the greatter confusion.
Let him yt is wicked (says ye Angel to S. Johan) become more wicked / and he
that is filthy / Wicked
become more filthye / that his damnacion may be the depar / and his sorrows
extremer. Apoca. 22.

The lord therefore of his mercy / send discipline with doctrine / into his
church. doctrine
For doctrine without discipline and restraint of vices / makes dissolute
hearers. And on the other side / discipline without doctrine / makes either
hipocrites / or else desperate doars. Discipline.
I have not written this in disprayse of all ye prestes of Kylke^nye or there
about. For my hope is yt some of them by this time are fallen to repentance /
though they be not many. An other thing was there / yt much had dyspleased
the prebendaryes and other prestes. Prestes
I had earnestly / ever sens my first coming / required them to observe and
follow ye only book of common prayer / which the king and his counsel had
that year put fourth by act of parliament. But that would they at no hand
obey / Excuses
allegynge for their vain and idle excuse / the lewd example of the
archebysshop of dublyne / which was always flacke in things perteyninge to
Gods glory / allegi^ge also the want of books / and that their own justices
and lawers had not yet consented thereunto. Justices
As though it had been lawful for their justices to have denied ye same / or
as though they had rather have hanged upon the^ / than upon the kings autorite
and commandment of his counsel.

In the weke after Eastre / when I had ones preached.xij. sermons among the^ /
and established the people / sermons.
as I thought / in the doctrine of repentance and necessary believe of the
Gospel in the true worshyppynges of one God our eternal father and no more /
and in ye hope of one redemer Jesus Christ and no more. I departed from
Kylke^nie to a^ other place of mine.v. miles of / called Holmes court / where
as / I remained till the assension day. Holmes Court.
In the mean time came sorrowful news unto me that M. Hugh Goodacker the
Archbishop of Armach / that godly preacher and virtuouse learned man / was
poysened at Dubline / by procurement of certain prestes of his diocese / for
preachinge Gods verite and rebukinge their common vices. Poison.
And letters by and by were directed unto me / by my special frindes from
thens / to be ware of the like in my diocese of Ossorie / which made me
paraue^ture more circu^spect tha^ I should have been. Kilkennie.
Upon ye assencio^ day I preached again at Kilkennie likewise on Trinite
sunday / and on S. Peter's day at midsomer than folowinge.

On the xxv day of July / ye prestes were as plesauntly disposed as might be /
and went by heaps from tavern to tavern / to seek the best Rob dauie and
aqua vite / which are their special drinks there. A Joy.
They cawsed all their cups to be filled in / with Gaudeamus in dolio / the
mystery thereof only known to them / and at that time to none other else.

K. Edward.
Which was that King Edward was dead / and that they were i^ hope to have up
their maskynge masses again. As we have in S. John's Reuelacio^ that they which
dwell on the earth (as do our earthly minded masmongers) should rejoice and be
glad / when Gods true witnesses were ones taken away / and should send gifts
one to an other for gladness / Gifts.
because they rebuked them of their wicked doings / Apca. xj. For ye must
consydre that the prestes are comme^ly the first that receive such news. The
next day folowinge / a very wicked justice called Thomas Hothe / with the
lord Mou^tgarret / resorted to the Cathedral church / requyrynge to have a
Communion / in the honor of S. Anne. Idolat.
Mark the blasphemouse blyndenesse and wylfull obstinacy of this beastly
papyst. The prestes made him answer / that I had forbidden them that
celebracion / saving only upon the sondayes. As I had in deed / for the
abhomynable ydolatries that I had seane therein. O Satan
I discharge you (says he) of obedience to your Bishop in this point / and
command you to do as ye have done heretofore / which was to make of Christ's
holy communion an ydolatrouse mass / and to suffer it to serve for ye dead /
clean contrary to the Christen use of the same.

Thus was the wicked justice / not only a vyolatour of Christ's institucion / A
traitor.
but also a contempner of his princes earnest commandment / and a prouoker of
the people by his ungracious example to do the like. This could he do whith
other mischefes more / by his long being there by a whole months space / but
for murders / theftes / ydolatryes / and abominable whoredoms / wherewith all
that nation habu^deth / for that time he sought no redress neither appointed
any correction. Wicked
The prestes thus rejoicing yt the King was dead / and yt they had been that
day confirmed in their supersticiouse obstinacy / resorted to the forseyd
false justice the same night at supper / to gratifye him with Rob Dauye and
Aqua vite / T. hoth
for that he had been so friendly unto them / and that he might still continue
in the same. The next day after was the Lady Jane Gylforde proclaimed their
Queen / with solemnite of processions / bonefyres / and banquettes / the said
justice / as I was infourmed / Blamed
sore blaming me for my absence that day / for in deed I much doubted that
matter.

So sone as it was there rumoured abroad yt ye King was departed from this
life / kearnes
ye ruffianes of ye wild nacyon / not only rebelled against the English
captains / as their lewd custom in such chaunges has been always /

young Earl of Ormonde / and Barnabe the barn of upper Ossories son / were
both slain in the court at London. Rumors.
Upon this wylye practice of myschefe / they raged without order in all places

which ought rather to have defended her. In this outrage had she after long

What a do I had that day with the prebendaryes and prestes abought wearinge
the cope / croser / and myter in procession / it were to much to write.

I told them earnestly / when they would have compelled me thereunto / that I
was not Moses minister but Christ's / Gods wurde.
I desired them that they would not compel me to his denial / which is (S.

again they played a Commedie of sanct Johan Baptistes preachinges / Comedies.
of Christ's baptisynge and of his te^ptacion in the wilderness / to the small
contentacion of the prestes and other papists there.

On ye thursdaye next folowinge / which was S. Bartylmewes day / I preached
again among them / Last sermon.
because the prebendaryes and other prestes there / had made their boastes /
that I should be compelled to recante all that I had preached before. And as I
was entered into the pulpet / I took this sainge of S. Paul for my thema. Non
erubesco Euangelium. Virtus enim Dei est, in salutem omni credenti, etc. I am
not ashamed of the Gospel. Gospel
And why? For it is the power of God into salvation / to all them that believe

coming thydre / the justice both bei^ge present. As yt our God was but one

And yt our Christ but was one Christ / and ought alone to be trusted to for
rede^pcio^ of sin. I earnestly charged ye people / to rest upon these ij.
principles firmly / as upon the chief stays of their salvation / as they
would answer it at the dredefull day / and not to suffer themselves to be led
by a contrariouse doctrine of deceytfull teachers / into any other believe from
the^s fourth. Item concerning ye sacrament of Christ's body and blood /
wheri^ they had been most prodigiously abused / through the insatiable
covetousness of the prestes. Sacrament.
I required them very reuere^tly to take it / as a sacrament only of Christ's
death / whereby we are redeemed and made innocent me^bres of his mystical body
/ and not to worship it as their God / as they had done / to the utter
derogacion of his heavenly honor. No worship.
And as I came in the Usual prayer / to remembrance of the dead. I willed
the^ to give hearty thanks to God / for their redempcio^ in Christ / largely
declaringe yt the sowles of ye righteouse were in ye hand of his mercy
without cruel torment. Sap. 3. and yt the prestes with all their masses and
funeral exequies / could nothi^ge add to their rede^pcio^ / if they had been
otherwise bestowed. Funerals.


After the prayer / I took ye Gospel of ye day. Beati oculi qui vident quae

But they made me none answer. Than said I unto them. Ye have set me fourth a

He answered / that he never saw me / neither yet had heard of me / before I

After dinner / that priest resorted unto us / as bold as great Hercules / and
after a little talk / fell to flat raylinge of good Miles Couerdale their

of his companions / vagabondes / apostataes / and ru^negates? With other
uncomely wurdes. And as I was bent to have made him an answer / A godly man.
a gentilman of the co^traie therabout / rubbed me on the elbowe / and bad me
in mine ear / to let him alone / and I should hear wonders. And the seyde

When supper was done / certain of the mariners resorted to us / declaringe what
an uncomely part the priest had played with their pypar / as that he had pyssed in

But when he ones perceived / that I would not demand my money of the

The next day after / I demanded my money of the Captain / and it was very
honestly delivered me / all scysmes / as I thought / pacified. moneie.
Howbeit that wretched Mammo^ / most strongely wrought in the vnquietouse heart
of the Captain / so that continually after that time / he threttened to set
us on land / and maruele it was / that he threw us not both over ye board.
Always were we well contented / to have gone to land / Parell.
but yet still he drove it of till we came into Dover road / I not
understanding the mystery co^cerninge the said money / as that it was in my
hand and not in the Captains / which marred all the whole matter. roauers
In the mean time they went a roauinge by a whole wekes space and more. And
first they took an English ship of Totnes / goi^ge toward Britain and
laden with tin / and that they spoiled both of ware and money under ye
color of French mennis goods. The next day in the afternone / beheld
they.ij. English ships more /.ij. ships.
whom they chaced all ye night long / and the next day also till.x. of the
clock / and of them they took one by reason yt his topsaile brake / and that
was a ship of lynne. In this had they nothing but apples / for he went for
his loadinge. pirates.
After yt traced they the seas over / more than half a weke / and found none
there but their own contray men / being men of war and sea robbers as they
were.

at dover
At the last they came to Dover road / and there would the Captain needs to
land with his purser. My companion Thomas and I / taking our selfs for free
passengers / desyered to go a land with them / but that might not be (he
said) till he had been there before. Yes / says Thomas / I will go a land /
if any man go / for I have nothing to do here. Thu shall not go (says the
Captain) but I will lay ye fast by the fete / if thu prate any more.
Stoughtly.
With yt one Cornelis stood fourth / and said. We are much to blame / that we
have not dispatched him ere this / and thrown him over the board. a pyrate
Than doubted I some mischefe in workinge among them. For one Martin an
English pyrate / but yet a french man borne / being sumtyme Tompsons man and
after that Stranguyshes man / and now one and their unthrifty no^bre / had
made them believe / that I was he / Shameless lies
wc not only had put down the mass in England / but also I had caused
Doctor Gardener / the bishopp of Winchestre to be kept so long in the tower
/ and yt also I had poysened (whom I loved and reverenced above all mortal
men) the king with many other most prodigiouse lies.

So went ye Captain and his purser with all these news a land / having also
with the^ my bishops seal / and.ij. Epistles sent me from Conradus Gesnerus,
and Alexander Alesius,.ij. Epistles.
with comme^dacions from Pellicanus, Pomeranus, Philippus Melanctho^, Ioachimus
Camerarius, Mathias Flacius, and other learned men / desierouse of the English
churches Antiquytees and doctrines. Which letters I had received at Dubline /
the day before I came to the ship / and not yet answered them. No treason.
These Epistles and seal / with an other letter sent to me from the counsel
of England / concerning my first calling to that pastoral office / they had
taken out of my male / vnknowinge to me. For that they had seane the kings
arms in my seal / as the manner is of bishops seals / they laid to my
charge the cou^terfettinge of the kings seal /.iij. slau^ders.
upon the.ij. Epistles / heresy / and upon the counsels letter / conspiricie
against the Queen / so well were they ouerseane in that malice for money. In
Dover among all his cups / this captain discovered these matters / as what
a man he had gotten in the borders of Irelande / suspiciously passinge over
from thens toward Scotland / with all the reest. And as he had perceived
some of the hearers desierouse of that pray / Crafty.
he called a great piece of his tale back again / and said / that he had set
us a land at Southampto^ / and so letten us go. His mind was to have sold me
/ if any man would have offered him a good sum of money.

After midnyght he returned again to the ship / pratinge among his cumpany
/ what he had done a land / and how he had almost lost all / by his busye
talk. A great act.
But he had heard of me (he said) much more than he knew before / and he
trusted that I should be to him and to all the ship / a profitable prise. The
next day in ye morni^ge after his first sleep / he arose / and with stought
cou^tenau^ce boasted / yt he would straight to London with his most dau^gerouse
carrryage / To London.
which were we.ij. poor innocent sowles that had done ill to noman / sauinge
that we could not bear with the blasphemies of the papists against God and
his Christ. Much to and fro was among them about that passage. In the end
they all concluded / that better it was to tarry still there with ye ship /
whyls one or.ij. of them went to the counsel of England / in massage and came
again / than thidre to travail with ship and all..ij. massengers.
To land goes the pursar and an other besides / to hyer their horses toward
London / For mountains of gold would be gotten ye ways / they said.

As I beheld this madness / though I little tha^ cared for my life / yet
said I to ye Captain. Captain.
Maistre Captain, what do you mean by these strange turmoilinges? Think ye
there is no God? Neither yet a reckeninge to be made at ye lattre day / of
these mad procedinges? The time has been sens our first metinge / that ye have
taken me for an honest passenger / and defended my innocence against ye cruel
pyrate Walter. How stands it with equite than / that ye now proclaim me / so
haynouse a traitor? Equite.
I am sure that ye ^nowe now no more by me / than ye ded before. Your allegacions
/ that I had put down the mass / emprisoned Doctor Gardener / and poysened
the king / are most false / as all the world knows. My seal and my other
letters are plain arguments of my truth and honest estimacion / of truth
and might be to your confusion / if I chanced to have righteouse hearers. I
pray you therefore in conscience / that ye tell me / what evil ye know else by
me / that ye make here so terrible doings? I can not see / says the Captain
/ that ye will be ordered after any good sort. My only misordre was than /
that my money was in my purse / and not in his. money
Whereunto I answered / with an heart full of dolor and heaviness / to behold
mennis so dampnable practices of mischefe for fylthie lucres sake.

I am contented maistre Captain (said I) to be ordered as ye will reasonably
have me. ordered.
What will ye give than (said the Captain) to be delivered into Flaunders /
and our purser to be called again? I answered / that I would give / as his
self would with reason and conscience require. If ye had told us so much
yester night (said he) this matter had been at a point / and we by this time
had been in Zela^de. Zela^de.
Than was all the rabble of the ship / bag / tag / and rag / called to the
reckeni^ge / rushelinge together as they had been the cooks of hell / with
their great Cerberus / an whole ho^dred pound demanded for my deliverance.
In the end it was concluded / that no less might aswage that Hungrye heat
than fifty pound at ye least / with this Prouiso / yt all the moneie which I
had in my purse / A prouiso
with part of my garments also / should be out of hand divided among them
and the Captain / which was.xxj. pound in the whole. I instauntly desiered /
that it might be received in part and payment of the other sum. A cry.
They cred all with one voice / Nay / we will none of that. Than I besought
them / that I might have at the least / an honest portion thereof / for payment
of my charges / whils I should be prouidinge / of so great a ransom / as they
had laid to me.

In fine they assented / that I should have.vj. crowns of mine own money
allowed me / for my costs / till I had found out my frindes. Allowaunce.
Than caused the Captain a piece of ordinance to be fiered / and a gunne to be
let / to call back the purser / and his companion. In whose return there was
much to and fro. For some would needs to London / thinkinge that way to win
more / tha^ to bring me into Flaunders. Lucre.
And of them which would into Flaunders / some would to land for a barrel of
dri^ke / for in the ship at that time / was neither bread / befe / nor
beer. Some feared the coming of the mayre and Captain of the castle / for
searchinge their ship. So that our Captain commanded them at the last / to
hoyse up the sails and spedily to pass toward Flanders. In the mean time
was I poor soul compelled / Faunders.
to set my hand to a false bylle of their deuisinge / as that I had hired
their ship in Irelande for fyftie pound / to bring me without delay or
tarriaunce into Zelande. Which I never ded / as the almighty lord well
knows / Co^pulsion.
but came from thens with them against my will / and was tossed to and fro upon
the seas / by the space of.xxiiij. days / in folowinge prises / as they call
their roberies. And I was by yt time / so full of lyce / as I could swarm.

As we came ones thydre / they brought me into the house of one of the.iiij.
owners of the ship / La^bert.
which was a man fearinge God / and his wife a woman of much godliness also /
which was to me careful creature / a singular confort provided of God. The
next day were all the.iiij. owners called to the reckeninge / and a Latyne
interpretour with them / to know how / where / and wha^ / this ransom of
fiftye pound should be paid? payment.
And more than.xxvj. days of layser for the payment thereof / might not be
granted. I desiered to have had liberte to go abroad / to seek my fri^des /
but that could I not obtain / though it were in my former covenant / when
the.vj. crowns were delivered me. In ye afternone was it noysed abroad, by
the dronken mariners all over / Dro^kardes.
that they had brought such a one with them out of Irelande / as paid half
an hundred pound for his passage / to the wonderinge of all ye town. So that
my host / was feign to keep me close in his house / and to say both to the
mariners and others / that I was gone to Andwerpe / the people there resorted
so fast to see me. Resort.
They reported there also in their drunkenness / that I was he which had put
down the mass in England / and had thrown Doctor Gardyner into the tower /
wytha great sort of lies and slanders more.

Thus continued I there / as a prisoner / by the space of.iij. wekes / sumtyme
threttened to be thrown in their commen iayle / threttes
sumtyme to be brought before the magistrates / sumtyme to be left to the
examinacio^ of the clergy / sumtyme to be sent to London / or else to be
delivered to the Queen's ambassadors at Brucels / but always by Gods prouysyon
I had mine host and hostess to fryndes. And behold a most wondrefull wurke
of God. A monk
The person of the town / a most cruel monk / a maistre of Louayne / and an
inquisitour of heretykes / as they call those Rabyes / the next day after my
coming / sore syckened / and never came out of his bed so long as I was
there / which was greatly marked of some of the inhabitauntes / being godly
affected. Deliberacion.
At the last / in deliberatinge the matter / that they required so much money
of me / and would not suffer me to go abroad to seek it / mine host bad the
Captain and mariners considre / how far they had ro^ne beyond the limits
of their commission / in mysusynge the English nation / with whom they had no
war. It may chance herafter (says he) depely to be laid to your charges.
Therefore by my assent / ye shall agree with this good man for less money. A
friend.
Than were they contented to receive.xxx. pound / as I should be able to pay
it / and so to discharge me.

Thus has my lord God most miraculously delivered me from all these
dau^gerouse parels / and from the gredye mouths of devouring lions /

I thought my self now of late / for the cares of this life / well satteled in

The conclusion.
I Write this unto the / thu sorrowful church of England / yt in ye mids of
thy afflictions thu should not despair. Behold how gracyously / yea / if I
may so speak it / how miraculously and gloriously / ye author.
the heavenly lord has delivered me / his most unworthy servant of all men
/ and an exceeding great sinner. He called me of grace to that office in his
vyneyarde / by sore persecucio^s he proved me of love / and at the lattre of
mercy and goodness he preserved me from the deadly furye of most fearce
enemies. Of mercy.
Thy calling to the Gospel is not unknown to the / thu careful
congregation. Now suffrest thu persecucions diversely / for not regardinge the
time of thy visitacio^. Repent yet in the end / and doubtless thu shall have
a most prosperouse delyueraunce. They are no noble men / yt do vex the at this
present. They are but pilde peltinge prestes / knights of the dongehill /
though they be sir Swepestretes / maistre doctors / and lord bishops.
Repent.
Look upon their faces / though thu measure not them by their fruits / and thu
shall sone know their virtues. They are fierye / hawtie / and lecherouse as
gootes / the chastest among them. But that shall other mennis wives know /
and not thu. prestes.

Like Christ


God has sufficiently declared in the scriptures / what his church is in this
world. As yt it is an afflicted and sorrowful congregation / forsaken in a
manner / and destitute of all human confort in this life. It may right well
be compared to a flock of orphans / ye church.
which being destitute of father and mother / are in this world subject to
many sorrowful calamitees and miseryes. But because that poor church should
not utterly discourage in her extreme aduersitees / the son of God has taken
her to his spowse / and has promised her protection / help and confort / in
all her afflictions and parels. So that she may at all times confort herself
with this verse of David / Though my father and mother has left me / yet has
the lord taken me up / for his / Psalm. 26. Help.
In the first promise was she taken to grace after transgressio(...) assured of

For if God had not most wonderfully collected her together / preserved her /

motherlesse children without comfort, but will come unto us / Ioa^. 14. That is
/ Like a ge^till and merciful lord / he will continually stand by his
church / assistinge / helpinge / and socouri^ge it alwai^^. I will be with you
(says he) to ye end of ye world / Math. 28. Let this be thy comfort you
sorrowful church of England, and stay thy self i^ hi^ wc was incarnate /
lived / wrought / taught / and dyed for thy sin / yea / he arose from ye
death and ascended to heaven for thy iustificacio^ / Romans 4. Cleave thu fast
to him / repent thy folyes past / and take heed to thy doi^ges from
hensfourth. Pray and fast busily / for this frantyck kind of Deuyls is never

ple^teously / and flourish in virtues herafter frutefully / to the praise of one
God eternal. Which lives and reigns world without end. Amen.
