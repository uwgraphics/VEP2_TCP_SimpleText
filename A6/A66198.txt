WHereas We have been Informed, That many Popish Priests and Jesuits have
presumed to come into this Kingdom, and to continue therein contrary to the
Laws and Statutes of this Realm; We have therefore thought fit to Command all

this Our Kingdom, under, such Penalties as by Law may be inflicted on them: And
do by this Our Royal Proclamation (Issued by the Advice of Our Privy Council)
strictly Charge and Command all Jesuits and Priests whatsoever, who have taken
Orders from the Sea of Rome, or by the Authority or pretended Authority
thereof, and not being under Restraint by Imprisonment, That they do forth with
depart out of this Our Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of
Berwick upon Tweed; And that they or any of them, or any other such Priests or
Jesuits do not presume to continue, come, or return into Our said Kingdom of
England, Dominion of Wales, or Town of Berwick, upon Pain of having the Laws
and Statutes of this Our Realm put in Execution against them.
