THE Suffering CASE OF William Gutheridge, Of Banwell in Sommersetshire, Truly
Stated, and Committed to the Tender Consideration of all True English Men.
ABout the Year 1676. James Crosman, Vicar of Banwell and Puckson in
Sommersetshire, procured a Writ of Attachment against the said William
Gutheridge, because for Conscience sake he could not Swear to an Answer to his
Bill in the Exchequer for small Tithes; and by Virtue thereof had him to
Ilchester Goal, and kept him there Four Years. The Value of the said Tithes
appears by the Affidavits of three men to be between Forty and Fifty Shillings
a Year; as also by the Certificate of Ten substantial Men of the Neighborhood,
Witnessed under their Hands; For which, after Four Years Imprisonment at
Ilchester, he, with Thomas Tegg, an Impropriator, had him up to the Fleet
Prison in London, where he has remained about Nine Years; and while so a
Prisoner, the said James Crosman, caused him to be Indicted at the Quarter
Sessions in Sommersetshire, upon the Statute of Recusancy, for being Absent
from his Parish Church Eleven Months: the Penalty Two Hundred and Twenty
Pounds, which put him to great Trouble and Charges. And not only this, but has
Prosecuted him in the Exchequer, and has Sworn his small Tithes to be worth
Six Pounds ten Shillings a Year; and thereupon has obtained a Sequestration
against him, and has Entered upon his Goods and Chattels, to the value of One
Hundred and Fifty one Pounds seven Shillings, as appears by the Appraisement
that he and the Sequestrators have Returned into the Court of Exchequer, but
are really worth about twice as much. And has also Seized upon his Lands and
Tenements, to the value of Sixty or Seventy Pounds a Year, which the
Sequestrators, by the direction of the said James Crosman, keeps in their
hands; and notwithstanding, keeps the said William Gutheridge in Prison,
saying, He shall never come out, he being separate a Hundred Miles from his
Wife and Family. And thus deprived of his Estate by the unheard of Cruelty of
this Priest James Crosman, and his Merciless Proceedings.

William Gutheridge.
