ADMONITIONS BY THE SVPREAME COUNCIL OF THE CONFEDERAT CATHOLICS OF IREAND,
To all his Majesty's faithful Loyal Subjects of the three Kingdoms of
England, Ireland, and Scotland.

Against a Solemn League and Covenant framed by the malignant party in the
Parliament of England.

As also against a Declaration of the English Lords and Commons assembled in
Parliament.

Printed by Command of the said Supreme Council, (...) Waterford by Thomas
Bourke, 26. Ian. 1643.

BY THE SVPREAME COUNCIL OF THE CONFEDERAT CATHOLICS of IRELAND.
HAving since the last general Assembly of the said Confederat Catholics held
at the City of Waterford seen a Solemn league and Covenant, framed by the
Malignant party in the Parliament of England, and by them procured to be sworn
by such of his Majesty's Subjects as they could seduce in the kingdom of
England, and Scotland, and sent likewise into some parts of this kingdom, to
infect others, wherein are contained resolutions so destructive to the
Professors of the Catholic Faith in general, to his Majesty's Protestant
Subjects and this Nation in particular, that we should betray the trust
reposed in us, had we not given timely notice thereof to the said Confederat
Catholics, whereby they may be forewarned of their utter extirpation
intended, so far as may lie in the power of the said Malignant party, to
which end we have caused the said solemn league and Covenant to be printed, in
which all Christian Princes and their good Subjects may observe, the insolency
of the said rebellious incendiaries being not satisfied to have withdrawn
themselves from their allegiance, and to have raised arms against so gracious
a King, but also thereby endeavor to poison the minds of the faithful
Subjects of other Princes with their disloyalty, inserting in the preamble of
that Rebellious Covenant these words (calling to mind the treacherous and
bloody plotts, Conspiracies, attempts, and practices of the enemies of God
against the true Religion and professors thereof in all places) not confining
themselves to the three kingdoms of England, Ireland, and Scotland, And in the
perclose of that Covenant, adding these words (most humbly beseeching the Lord
to strengthen us by his Holy Spirit, for this end and to bless our designs
and proceedings with such success as may be deliverance and safety to his
people, and encouragement to other Christian Churches groaning under, or in
danger of the yoke of Antichristian tyranny to join in the same or the like
association and Covenant.) By which all the world may evidently see; how far
they desire their treason against Monarchy to be spread, by such and the like
Covenant and malicious practice, and in other the parts of that oath, bounded
to the limitts of the three Kingdoms of England, Ireland, and Scotland, they
swear to a reformation (as they term it) of Religion in England, and
Ireland, and to endeavor to bring the Church of God in the said three
kingdoms to uniformitie in Religion and Confession of Faith, and that they
shall in like manner without respect of persons endeavor the extirpation of
Popery and Prelacy, as hereafter in the oath is more at large expressed,
whereby the Catholics of England, Ireland, and Scotland may plainly forsee
what rigor they are to expect, and how they stand forewarned to prepare
themselves for a defensive and offensive war against the said Malignant
party, or failing therein will be driven to quit all they can call theirs in
England, Ireland, and Scotland. How vain it is for any his Majesty's
Catholic Subjects to hope for mercy, at the hands of that party, when the
general words (without respect of persons,) have left no exemption for any,
but would extirpate all without distinction of person, or difference of
quality, contrary to the law of Nations, and when their malice is so high
swollen that they assume Regal authority so far as to presume to proclaim
war against us, their fellow Subjects, even in the best times of their
loyalty, and that without any relation to his Majesty's allowance. So as we
are to expect no peace until they be reclaimed, and when they so despise the
power and interest of his Majesty, and of his Protestant and Catholic
Subjects of the three kingdoms, as that they resolve likewise the extirpation
of Archbishops, Bishops, Prelates and all other dignitaries of what religion
soever, we therefore being bound by the oath of association solemnly by us
taken to preserve our Religion, maintain the privileges and just prerogatives
of our Sacred Sovereign, and defend the liberties of our Country, observing
by the sinister and un godly practices of the said Malignant party that the
whole scope of their wicked intentions is to extirpate the Catholic Religion,
and the professors thereof in the said three kingdoms, destroy Monarchy,
deprive our said Sovereign of his just prerogatives, and banish or put to
death all such of his Majesty's Subjects, as well Protestants, as Catholics who
will not conform themselves to their doctrine, so erroneous and destructive to
the rights of Monarchy, in discharge of our said oath, for the preservation of
our Religion, in observance of our Loyalty to our said Sacred Sovereign, the
maintenance of his Prerogatives, the defense of our lives, liberties and
estates, and lives liberties and estates of all his Majesty's well affected
Subjects in his said three Kingdoms, do earnestly desire them upon view and
perusal of the said Covenant seriously to consider the dangerous and foul
intentions of the said evil projectors, and to make full and timely
preparation for the safety of themselves and their posterity, and do also
desire all Catholic Princes and their good Subjects, assecting the
preservation of their Religion, and the Rights of Sovereignty, to consider how
far they are concerned in that so bloody and impious a resolution, and to find
a timely and fit remedy to be applied to so contagious a design, which the
said Malignant party would invite the Subjects of all Christian Princes to
intertaine.

A SOLEMN LEAGVE AND COVENANT FOR REFORMATION AND DEFENSE OF RELIGION The
honor and happiness of the KING, and the peace and safety of the three

A solemn League and Covenant for Reformation and defense of Religion, the
honor and happiness of the King, and the peace and safety of the three
Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland.
WE Noblemen, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen, Citizens, Burgesses, Ministers of the
Gospel, and Commons of all sorts in the Kingdoms of England, Scotland and
Ireland, by the providence of God living under one King, and being of one
reformed religion, having before our eyes the glory of God, and the advancement
of the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, the honor and happiness of the
Kings Majesty and his posterity, and the true public liberty, safety and
peace of the kingdoms, wherein every ones private condition is included, and
calling to mind the treacherous and bloody plotts, conspiracies, attempts, and
practices of the enemies of God against the true Religion, and professors
thereof in all places, especially in these three kingdoms, ever since the
reformation of Religion, and how much their rage, power and presumption, are of
late, and at this time increased and exercised, whereof the deplorable state of
the Church and Kingdom of Ireland, the distressed estate of the Church and
kingdom of England, and the dangerous estate of the Church and kingdom of
Scotland, are present and public testimonies. We have now at last after other
means of supplication, remonstrance, Protestations and sufferings, for the
preservation of our selves and our Religion, from utter ruin and destruction,
according to the commendable practice of these kingdoms in former times, and
the example of Gods people in other Nations; after mature deliberation,
resolved and determined to enter into a mutual and solemn League and
Covenant, wherein we all subscribe, and each one of us for himself, with our
hands lifted up to the most High God, do swear.

1. That we shall sincerely, really, and constantly through the grace of God,
endeavor in our several places and callings, the preservation of the reformed
Religion in the Church of Scotland, in doctrine worship, discipline and
government, against our common enemies, the reformation of Religion in the
kingdoms of England and Ireland, in doctrine, worship, discipline, and
government, according to the Word of God, and the example of the best reformed
Churches. And shall endeavor to bring the Churches of God in the three
kingdoms to the nearest conjunction and uniformity in religion, confession of
Faith, Form of Church government, directory for worship, and Cathechising,
that we and all our posterity after us, may as brethren live in Faith and
love, and the Lord may delight to dwell in the midst of us.

2. That we shall in the like manner without respect of persons, endeavor the
extirpation of Popery, Prelacy, that is, Church-governement, by Archbishops,
Bishops, their Chauncellours and Commissaries, Deanes, Chapters, Archdeacons,
and all other Ecclesiastical officers depending on that Hierarchy,
superstition, heresy, schism, profaneness, and whatsoever shall be found to
be contrary to sound doctrine, and the power of godliness, lest we partake in
other men's sins, and thereby be in danger to receive of their plagues, and
that the Lord may be one, and his Name one in the three kingdoms.

3. We shall with the same sincerity, reallity, and constancy in our several
vocations, endeavor with our estates and lives, mutually to preserve the
rights and privileges of Parliaments, and the liberties of the kingdoms; and
to preserve and defend the Kings Majesty's person and authority in the
preservation and defense of the true Religion and Liberties of the kingdoms,
that the world may bear witness with our consciences of our Loyalty, and
that we have no thoughts or intentions to diminish his Majesty's just power and
greatness.

4. We shall also with all faithfulness endeavor the discovery of all such
as have been, or shall be incendiaties, malignants or evil instruments, by
hindering the reformation of Religion, dividing the King from his people, or
one of the kingdoms from another, or making any faction or parties amongst the
people, contrary to this League and Covenant, that they may be brought to
public trial, and receive co^ndigne punishment, as the degree of their
offenses shall require or deserve, or the supreme Iudicatories of both
kingdoms respectively, or others having power from them for that effect, shall
judge convenient.

5. And whereas the happiness of a blessed peace between these kingdoms,
denied in former times to our progenitors, is by the good providence of God
granted unto us, and has been lately concluded, and settled by both
Parliaments, we shall each of us according to our place and interest endeavor
that they may remain conjoined in a firm peace, and union to all posterity:
And that Justice may be done upon the wilful opposers thereof, in manner
expressed in the precedent Article.

6. We shall also according to our places and callings in this common cause of
Religion, liberty and peace of the kingdoms, assist and defend all those that
enter into this League, and Covenant, in the maintaining and pursuing thereof,
and shall not suffer our selves directly nor indirectly by whosoever
combination, persuasion or terror, to be divided from this blessed union and
conjunction, whether to make defection to the contrary parts or to give our
selves to a detestable indifferency or neutrality in this cause, which so much
concerns the glory of God, the good of the kingdoms, and honor of the King,
but shall all the days of our lives zealously and constantly continue therein,
against all opposition, and promote the same according to our power against all
letts and impediments whatsoever; and what we are not able ourselves to
suppress or overcome, we shall reveal and make known that it may be timely
prevented, all which, we shall do as in the sight of God.

And because these kingdoms are guilty of many sins and provocations against
God, and his Son Jesus Christ, as is too manifest, by our present distresses
and dangers, the fruits thereof; we profess and declare before God, and the
world, our unfayned desire to be humbled for our own sins, and for the sins
of these kingdoms, especially, that we have not as we ought valued the
inestimable benefit of the Gospel, that we have not labored for the purity
and power thereof, and that we have not endeavored to receive Christ in our
hearts, nor to walk worthy of him in our lives, which are the causes of other
sins and transgressions so much abounding amongst us; And our true and unfeigned
purpose, desire, and endeavor for our selves, and all others under our power
and charge, both in public and in private, in all duties we owe to God and
man, to amend our lives, and each one to go before other in the example of a
real Reformation, that the Lord may turn away his wrath and heavy
indignation, and establish these Churches and kingdoms in truth and peace, and
this Covenant we make in the presence of Almighty God, the searcher of all
hearts, with a true intention to perform the same as we shall answer at that
great day, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed; most humbly
beseeching the Lord to strengthen us by his Holy Spirit for this end, and to
bless our desires and proceedings, with such success as may be deliverance
and safety to his people, and encouragement to other Christian Churches,
groaning under, or in danger of the yoke of Antichristian Tyranny, to join in
the same, or like Association and Covenant, to the glory of God, the
enlargement of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and the peace and tranquillity of
Christian Kingdoms and Commonwealths.

BY THE SVPREAME COUNCIL OF THE CONFEDERAT CATHOLICS of IRELAND.
THe ensueing Declaration having come to our hands soon after the recesse of
the late General Assembly of the Confederate Catholics held at Waterford,
we thought fit for the better publishing thereof, in all the parts of this
kingdom, that the same should be printed, whereby his Majesty's good
Subjects, may evidently see, what insolent expressions are therein contained,
against his Majesty's power, and proceedings, against his Majesty's Catholic
Subjects, and against all well minded Protestants, that labor to settle a
right understanding, betwixt his Majesty and his Subjects of this kingdom:
they take upon them to Censure his Majesty for displacing persons affected to
Religion, and putting into their places men Popishly addicted, or in plain
English for displacing Sir William Parsons, and appointing Sir Henry Tichborne
one of the Justices, and of the rest it is apparent whom they mean, they take
notice that in his Majesty's Commission sent hither to receive the Grievances
of his people, some of the Commissioners were Papists, there being none named
of such as they intend thereby, but the Earl of Clanrikard, (whom it seems
they think) either unworthy of that honor, or unfit to be trusted: they say,
that the Catholics of this kingdom are reduced to such Necessity, that they
devour and eat one another, which (praise be to God) is most false, our
markets being in most places, as well supplied as at any time before: and where
those here of the State, that did adhere, to the malignant party in England,
resolved to destroy this Nation by famine, and to that purpose advised all the
Corns, in the march of the forces, to be burned, and accordingly very much
Corn was Burned, many thousands of the said forces by the just Judgment of God
perished within their Garrisons in sundry parts of this kingdom for want of
victuals, they labored to hinder any Cessation with the said Catholics,
urging that the design thereof did arise first from them, (an objection proper
to such as rebel against their King,) ought not a dutiful people to petition
for redress of their grievances to their Prince, they affirm that the raising
of Arms by this Nation, (which they Call Rebellion,) was without provocation,
but resolutions of extirpating, the Catholic Religion, and the professors
thereof, in this kingdom, will be proved, not only by testimony of
Catholics, but even of many Protestants, and then all the world they hope will
witness with them the justness, and necessity of this war: and though they
insult of success, and insinuate, that the Catholics failing to prevail by
strength, have recourse to Craft. Yet it is well known that in most Conflicts
the loss was greater of the other side: the Authors of this Declaration are
not satisfied to have overbusied themselves and assumed Regal Power in
England, but hereby let the Counsel of State here, know, how highly they have
offended, that they acquainted them not with the intention of a Cessation of
Arms, and let them also know, that they represented the wants of the Armies
here unto the Parliament of England, with much Craft to have a ground,
wherewith to color the Cessation as if his Majesty's Commission were not
sufficient to justify their proceedings therein, and conclude with this
inference, that the forces here by means of this Cessation, will find
opportunity to join with the Popish party in England, for their greater
strengthening, by all which it is evident, that if the usurped Regal power of
those incendiaries, can have influence on Ireland, that none with, or without
his Majesty's Commission shall stand justified, but such as adhere to them and
their Rebellion, and forsake their Loyalty, and obedience to his Majesty's
Commands.

A DECLARATION OF THE LORDS AND COMMONS ASSEMBLED IN PARLIAMENT.

Showing the present design now on foot (by virtue of a pretended Commission
from his Majesty) for a cessation of Arms, or treaty of peace with the
Rebels in Ireland, now they are brought to such a low condition, that they are
enforced to devour and eat one another, in some parts of that kingdom: And
by what Popish instruments and ministers in their Council at the Court, the
said design is, and has been carried on, persons of great trust, eminent for
their affection or Religion and hatred of the Rebels being displaced, and men
Popishly addicted put in their offices: all serving for the better introduction
of Popery, and extirpation of the true Protestant Religion in that and other of
his Majesty's dominions.

Die Sabbathi 30. September. 1643.
Ordered by the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament that this declaration
shall be forthwith printed and published.

Io. Brown Cler. Parlment.

London, Printed for Io. Wright in old Baily, October. 2. 1645.

A DECLARATION OF THE LORDS AND COMMONS ASSEMBLED IN PARLIAMENT,
AS it is evident to all the world that this late horrid Rebellion of the
Papists in Ireland did without any color or pretext of provocation professedly
and boldly aim at the destruction of the Protestant Religion, the rejecting of
the laws of England, and the extirpation of the British inhabitants out of
that kingdom; so it is no less manifest that this Parliament of England (to
whom his Majesty has left the managing of the war against those rebels) has
taken the troubles of Ireland to heart with that resentment and compassion as
may evidence their zeal to Religion, their love to their distressed Countrymen
and brethren there, in these times, when the Jesuitical practices have cast
England into woeful distractions, and unnatural war, notwithstanding which,
the reducing of Ireland has still been a chief part of the care of this
Parliament, And God has been pleased to bless our endeavors with such
success as that those furious blood, thirsty Papists have been in the carrier
of their cruelty, some part of the Protestant blood which at first was spilt
like water upon the ground has been revenged, their massacres, burnings and
famishings, have by a divine retaliation been repayde into their bosom; And
the Protestant party has been erected to that condition of strenght and hope,
that their enemies are constrained (distrusting their forces) to have recourse
to their craft and policies, and therefore by their subtle Agents at Court,
and their active instruments elsewhere, have been endeavoring now of along
time to make our Armies in Ireland disaffected to the Parliament, what by
occasion of their wants not so readily supplied as their need required, what
by misusing them with these unhappy differences fallen in here between King
and People, laboring by that means to devide those forces into factions, to
the end the maine work they have in hand might be neglected, which is the
prosecution of the war against the Rebels, and so far brought low in some
parts of Ireland, that if they can be deprived of the benefit of this
Harvest, they are not likely to see the next Summer. And therefore the Rebels
finding that notwithstanding the distractions here occasioning the slownesse
and scarceness of supplies, yet they themselves are in a far worse
condition, being in want of most things necessary, not only for the
maintayning of a war, but even of life the judgment of God being remarkable
upon them in this, that as their bloody and treacherous Religion made them
inhumanely cruel in shedding the protestants blood, so now the famine amongst
many of them has made them unnaturally, and Canniball-like eat and feed one
upon another. Therefore that they may have time to expect from their friends
abroad new supplies both of victuals and ammunition, and may without
molestation reap the fruit of this harvest, they have labored a treaty for a
Cessation, which project of theirs does no less aim at the overthrow of the
remainder of the Protestants in that kingdom then their treacherous taking of
Arms at the first did intend the destruction of them all; for their Cessation
and hostility, their war and peace are alike to be esteemed of, and with
those that neither in peace nor war keep any faith, it is best to be in
perpetual defiance: Therefore the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled
according to their continued care of that kingdom of Ireland do in a special
manner take into their consideration the condition thereof upon this occasion
of an intended Cessation, and so much the rather because it is feared that the
Protestant forces through want of Provision for their Armies, may at last, if
not relieved be persuaded to admit of this course in hope thereby to procure
some means for their subsisting, as also because there is too much ground to
suspect, that if this Cessation should be agreed unto, they might have
opportunity to join with the papist party here for their greater
strenghtning. And though it were to have no influence upon this kingdom, yet
the evil consequences of it are so many and pernicious to Ireland, that this
Parliament should betray the trust reposed in them, if they did not declare
against this Cessation, and use all means in time to make it prove abortive,
And therefore they desire that it may be observed and taken notice of.

First from whence the Counsel and design of this Cessation arises even from
the rebels and Papists themselves for their own preservation, for soon after
they had missed of their intent to make themselves absolute masters of that
kingdom of Ireland by their treacherous surprises. And seeing that this
kingdom did with most generous and Christian resolutions undertake the charges
of war for the relief and recovery of Ireland, propositions were brought
from the Rebellion the Lords Dillon and Taffe at which time they were
intercepted. (...) restrained by order of the house of Commons: After that,
they had the boldness even while their hands were still imbrued in the
Protestant blood to petition to his Majesty that their demands might be heard,
and for this purpose they obtained a Commission to be sent over into Ireland to
diverse persons of quality (whereof some were Papists) to hear, receive, and
transmit to his Majesty their demands which was done accordingly, and one
Master Bourke, a notorious pragmaticke Irish papist, was the chief solicitor
in this business, after this, the just revenging God giving daily success to
the handful of the Protestant forces, against their great numbers, so that by
a wonderful blessing from heaven they were in most parts put to the worst.
Then did they begin to set on foot an overtime for a Cessation of Arms,
concerning which, what going and coming has been between the Court and the
Rebels is very well known, and what meetings and treaties have been held
about it in Ireland by warrant of his Majesty's ample Commission sent to that
effect; and what reception and countenance most pragmaticke Papists negotiating
the business and found at Court, and that those of the State in Dublin who had
so much Religion, and honesty as to dissuade the Cessation were first
discountenanced and at last put out of their places, and restrained to prison,
as Sir William Parsons one of the Lords sustices there, Sir John Temple Master
of the Rolls, Sir Adam Loftus Treasurer of Ireland, and Treasurer at wars,
and Sir Robert Meredith one also of the Councell-Table.

Secondly the Lords and Commons desire it may be observed that during all these
passages and negotiations the houses of Parliament were never acquainted by the
state of Ireland with the treaty of a Cessation, much less was their advise or
Counsel demanded, notwithstanding that the care, and managing of the war was
devolved on them both by Act of Parliament, and by his Majesty's Commission
under the great Seal, to advise, order, and dispose of all things concerning
the government, and defense of that kingdom, but the wants of the Army were
often represented and complained of, whereby with much craft a ground was
preparing for the pretext, wherewith now they would cover the Counsel of this
Cessation, as if nothing had drawn it on, but the extreme wants of their
Armies, whereas it is evident, that the report of such a treaty have been (in
a great part) the cause of their wants, for thereby the adventurers were
disheartened, contributions were stopped, and by the admittance to Court of the
negotiators of this Cessation: their wicked Council have had that influence,
as to procure the intercepting of much provisions which were sent for Ireland,
so that Ships going for Ireland with victuals, and others coming from thence
with commodities to exchange for victuals, have been taken by Dunkerkers
having his Majesty's warrant, but also by English Ships commanded by Sir John
Pennigton under his Majesty. And moreover the Parliament messengers sent into
several Counties with the Ordinance of January last for Ioanes, and
contributions, have been taken, and imprisoned, their Money taken from them,
and not one penny either loan or contribution has been suffered to be sent in
for Ireland, from those Counties which were under the power of the Kings army,
while in the mean time the houses of Parliament by their ordinances,
declarations, and solicitations to the City of London, and the counties free
from the terror of the Kings forces were still procuring not contemptible aid
and relief for the distresses of Ireland,

Thirdly, as the Lords and Commons have reason to declare against this plot and
design of a Cessation of arms, as being treated and carried on without their
advise, so also, because of the great prejudice which will thereby redound to
the Protestant Religion and the encouragement, and advancement which it will
give to the practice of Popery, when these rebellious Papists, shall by this
agreement continue and set up with more freedom their Idolatrous worship,
their Popish superstitions, and Romish abominations in all the places of their
command, to the dishonoring of God, the grieving of all true Protestant hearts,
the dispising the Laws of the Crown of England, and to the provoking of the
wrath of a Jealous God, as if both kingdoms had not smarted enough already for
this sin, of too much connyving at, and tolerating of Antichristian Idolatry,
under pretext of Civil contracts and politic agreements.

In the fourth place they desire it may be observed that this Cessation will
prove dishonorable to the public faith of this kingdom, it will elude and
make null the acts and ordinances of Parliament made for the forfeyting of
Rebels Lands, at the passing of which acts it was represented that such a
course would drive the Rebels to despair, and it prove so, but otherwise then
was meant. For dispayring of their force and courage they go about to overcome
us with their craft.

Lastly what shall become of the many poor exiled Protestants turned out of
their estates by this rebellion, who must now continue begging their bread,
while the rebels shall enjoy their lands and houses, And who shall secure the
rest of the Protestants that either by their own courage, industry, and great
charges has kept their possessions, or by the success of our Armies have
been restored, can there be any assurance gotten from a perfidious enemy of a
Cessation, from butchery, and breach of agreement, when they shall see a fit
time and opportunity.

These and many other considerations being well weighed, it will appear
evidently, that this design of a Cessation is a deep plot laid by the
Rebels, and really invented for their own safety and falsely pretended to be
for the benefit of our Armies: And whereas the Lords and Commons have no
certain information, that the treaty is concluded, but are informed by
several letters, that all the Protestants as well inhabitants as soldiors in
that kingdom, are resolved to withstand that proceeding, and to adventure on
the greatest extremities, rather then have any sort of peace with that
generation, who have so cruelly, in time of peace, murdered many thousands of
our Contrymen, and labored to extirpe the Protestant Religion from amongst
them, so they do believe, that these rumors of a Cessation were first
contrived by the enemies of our Religion and peace, and by their practices the
treaty was carried on with much subtility and solicitation thereby to stop
the sending of supplies from thence to our Armies, and for the cooling of the
affections of those who have already showed their zeal to the weal of
Ireland, and therefore the only means to defeat this their policy, and
prevent the evils intended by it, is to settle a course whereby the army of
Ireland may be at least fenced against hunger and cold, for which purpose it is
desired, that all those who are well affected to the Protestant Reliligion,
either in that or this kingdom. And all those who by their adventures already
made, have embarked their particular interests with the public of that
kingdom, and do desire a good return of their engagements will join their
endeavors for obviating of that necessity, which may be made a strong argument
to enforce a destructive Cessation of Arms, and that they would nor through
too much suspicion and jealousy of it forbear the providing of supplies, and
so occasion that inconvenience which they ought by all means to prevent, for
by so doing they will loose all their former pains and charges, and the
withholding of provisions will gain credit to that calumny laid against this
kingdom, and neglecting the armies of Ireland, and by the continuing of
supplies, these forces will be encouraged to continue the war, and so ^owne
both their work and ours.

And lastly the Rebels seeing assistance against them still flowing from hence
must needs be out of hope of prosecuting or concluding this their design, the
cry of much Protestant blood, the great indigencie of many ruynate families,
the danger of our Religion almost exiled out of that kingdom calls for this
last act of piety, charity, justice, and policy from us, which being resolved
on letters are to be dispatched to the several parts of that kingdom to
encourage the Commanders and soldiers upon the foresaid reasons and
assurances, that they may not hearken to such an unjust and deceitful
counsel, and as by their prosecuting of the war through Gods blessing, they
have success fully resisted the Rebels cruelty, so they may upon this occasion
beware they be not over reached by their crafts.

All which the Lords and Commons do earnestly desire may be seriously taken
into heart by all the kingdom, and that from those other encouragements
mentioned at large, in the ordinance of the fourteenth of July last, and such
as are now offered, a course may be taken whereby such a constant weekly
contribution may be settled, as will supply the Army in Ireland, The mere
necessity of nature which may be more punctually and seasonably transmitted
into the several parts of that kingdom according to their respective wants,
that so the benefit and honor of so pious a work, happily begun, and
successively hitherto carried on may not be lost when so little remaynes to be
done, And that the saving of a kingdom, the reestablishing of so many
Protestants Churches, the repossessing of so many thousand Christians unto
their estates may not be deserted and let fall to the ground for a little more
pains and cost.

FINIS.
