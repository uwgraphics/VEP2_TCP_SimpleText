An Epistle of Love, and of Consolation unto Israel, from the pouring forth of
the Spirit, and holy Anointing of the Father, sent in Bowels of tender Love,
unto the Chosen and Elect Seed of Life, etc.
A Trumpet sounded out of the Holy City, proclaiming the day of Salvation, and
of Sions Redemption; and this is to go abroad, as sent of the Father, as the
greetings of Love and Life, unto his own Begotten, unto whom the free streams
of the pure eternal Fountain flows, from the fullness of the Treasures of Gods
Wisdom, which abundantly is multiplied and increased in the habitations of the
Faithful; yea, the City of the living God, new Jerusalem is come down from
above, the blessed Habitation, in which flows the everlasting streams of Love
and Consolation; the Kingdom of Glory is revealed, the Son of Righteousness is
risen in his Beauty, in his transparent Brightness, the Glory of all Nations is
come; and this is the Day, wherein the Lord God is binding up his Jewels, in
the bond of Life, in the tie of his own Spirit; and the Lamb is come to Reign
of his Temple, and blessed are all who are waiting for him, and for his
glorious Appearance, who is coming with Power and with great Glory, to Reign in
his eternal Majesty; yea, the Son of Peace and of Consolation is come, the
express Image of the Fathers Glory, the very Substance of all things, the end
of the Prophets, the ministration of Life, which all are to feel within the
holy Mountain of God; where the Table is spread, where the Feast of fat things
is prepared, where Jacobs Well is set open, where the streams of the pure
Fountain freely flow in the still Habitation. Oh, the virtue of the Life of the
Love of God! feel the Breast of everlasting Consolation, draw, drink
abundantly; there is no end of this pure River, whose Waters are as clear as
Crystal; and from the Throne of the most Holiest, the waters slow plentifully;
in the glorious dewlling place, in the Habitation of Isreal's God, within the
Tents of Jacob, where the harmony of Angels is heard, where the sound of the
holy One is uttered forth; in the midst of the Temple of God, in the Heaven of
Heavens, where the Turtle-Doves do fly from the Throne of his Glory, whose
Majesty and Brightness has ravished my heart.

And the Lord God has spoken, and therefore I will speak, for God has
unloosed my tongue, to speak to the praise of his Name, who is the great and
wonderful Counselor, the mighty God of Israel, the holy One, in the midst of
the Tents of Jacob, where Glory and Peace possesses her dwelling places, the
Kingdom that is without end: God has revealed the Kingdom, which consists in
Power and Life; so all are to come who believe in that Power which creates
anew in Christ Jesus; that Power which renews into the Image and likeness of
God, as in the beginning; for God planted his Lilly in his own Paradise, which
Lilly sometimes grew among the Thorns; so all are to feel the good Husbandman,
to pluck up the Thorns, that so the Lilly may grow and increase, and
overspread the earth; and this Lilly God will cloth with a more glorious
Garment, with a more beautiful Raiment, than Solomon the Wise King was clothed
with; the Robe of Honor, the Garment of Grace, God will put on upon his own
Seed the Plant of his renown, and this shall overspread the earth; where briars
and brambles have grown, there shall the Lilly grow, and there shall the voice
of the Turtle sing; and the Winter is passing away, and the Summer is well nigh
come, wherein the Lilly begins to appear in the field of pleasure, after the
frosty Winter, after the dark howling Night; for out of the Wilderness God is
leading Israel by the hand, into the good Land, through the Red Sea, in the
narrow Way, in the straight Path, where the Holy tread and walk, and are not
weary, for the sound of the voice of the glorious God is heard, whole voice
gives Life; and now is the last Trumpet sounded, which has raised the Dead,
which has opened the Graves, and the dissolving Power of the Lord God, is
dissolving Hell and Death; so that Power which raises the Dead to Life, all
are to press after, to be raised thereby unto the Resurrection of Life; so the
breathing Power, the inlivening quickening Spirit of the second Adam, all are to
wait in, to hear the voice of the Shepherd of Israel, whose voice the Living
come to hear, who are raised to Life thereby: And this is the day of the Lord
God, wherein he has appeared in everlasting and eternal glorious Brightness,
who is breaking open the depths of the Mysteries of his own Kingdom, which
Mysteries are revealed in the hearts of the Faithful, who know the Key of
David, which shuts and opens, which reveals and seals; and blessed are all who
dwell in the Life, of the Holy Lamb, such know the sweet Consolation, such know
the pure Fountain of Life, which is Eternal Love, such are Born of Love; and
this is the Birth which is brought forth thorough the Travel, thorough Death,
thorough the Tribulation; the Life of the Lamb of God is raised, which Life
must Reign, for God is advancing his chosen Seed, God is establishing it on the
Throne of David, in the Ark of his most holy Treasure, where his secret
walkings are known; and the Word of the Lord God is a burning and a shining
Light, which Light is the Leader of Israel, the Star of Jacob, which goes
before the Followers of the Lamb, and this is Isreal's Leader, the Light, the
Truth, the Life: who are led by it into all Truth, such know the Promise of the
Father fulfiled in them, such know the pouring forth of the Spirit, the holy
Anointing; such are they who are taught of the Lord, who are established in the
Kingdom of God, who know the windows of Heaven opened, and the Rain descending,
who know the Prophesies of the Sprit of Life; such are come to the everlasting
Prophet, the High Priest of God, the Wise Counselor, the King of all Nations,
who rules all things by the Word of his Authority, who rebukes the Waters,
and turns the Waves backward; and blessed are all, who know him in the
Vessel, who arises to rebuke the Waves, when the Waters swell and are
troubled, then has his voice spoken Peace; and this is known in the, Way to
Life, and this many must come to know, before they enter into the Land of Rest,
before they enter into the Kingdom of God, which I say is come unto; they who
have waited, who have believed in the Light, such receive the Life, who in the
Light wait, in the silence, in the still Habitation, such come to hear the
voice of their Beloved, such come to be clothed with the Righteousness of God:
but first all must know the putting off, the stripping, the purifying, the
dying, and so the change is wrought by the unchangeable Word, by which all
things are made anew, and a new Life is brought forth; and this is the very
substance of all Profession, to know the Kingdom of God revealed, and to know
the Son of God to bear Rule in the heart, who is come to Reign, and to cast out
the unclean Spirits; so all must come to know the effectual working of the
Divine Power of Life, which works in the Love, which Love destroys death,
which breaks the cords thereof; and all who come to know the working of the
nature of Love, are brought into the nature of its Life, Likeness, and Image;
so here where the work of God goes on, there is the rejoicing known, because
of the Glory which shines in from Gods most holy Providence, where the streams
of his Life flow continually this makes all to rejoice and to sing for joy of
heart, for the Bridegroom is come, the Virgins have met him, and the Damsels
dance at the glory of his Brightness, who hears the sound of the Harp of
David, where the new Songs are heard, where the Turtle sings, where our Beloved
rejoices, because of the smiles of the Fathers lovely countenance, whose
beautiful appearance exceeds in Glory, whose Majesty reigns, whose Kingdom
is come, and a glorious sound is gone forth as a mighty shout; therefore let
the Righteous rejoice, and let the Inhabitants of Jerusalem be glad, let the
Heavens and the tops thereof shout, for a mighty King is in the midst, the
Reign of the God of Israel is come; and therefore this was upon my heart, to
sound forth the day of Sions Redemption: And this was the voice that run
thorough me, that Sions Redemption draws nigh, wherein her Converts shall
sing for Joy of heart, for the ravishing Glory of God did overshadow me, and
the Word of Eternal Life run thorough me, often saying, Publish the day of the
Lord God, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, as a mighty shout; and this is to
go thorough this Nation, as it was given into me, for this very end, to send it
with speed, as the everlasting Message of Life, as the greetings of Peace, by
the Word of Salvation: And the Truth of the Lord I must spread, for the Lord
God has lighted my Candle, and it must not be hid; and thus says the Spirit
of Truth, Publish the day of the Lord God; and in the free Authority of the
Spirit of Life, I send this Message of Truth by the streams of Love, from the
Son of Love and of Consolation, whose day is come, whose Name shall sound
thorough the Nations, and many shall be gathered to walk in the Light of Sion,
who shall have a Habitation in the Tents of Jacob, in Jerusalem; the City of
the Faithful, and Beloved of God; for many shall be gathered in this glorious
day, for God is setting of the Seed of Sion free: And the Freeborn Children
shall inherit the Land of Promise, the Seed of Abraham, who are born of the
Birth of God, who are Heirs of the Kingdom and Crown of Life: These are they
who are of the number of God, who are the Lambs Army, who follow him
wheresoever he goes; for the Lion of the Tribe of Judah has roared with a
voice of Thunder, sounding forth the day of the Lord God, unto the Inhabitants
of the Earth, that they may hasten into the Ark of God, before the Flood
comes; for verily I do declare what I have seen: A Flood shall come suddenly,
and blessed are all who prepare into the intired Life; who are found in that
day to be of the number of God, who are marked with the Lambs Mark, who are
sealed with the Seal of Life: And in the Authority of the Divine Majesty of the
holy Wise God, I do declare the day of the Lord which is coming, which is
glorious to the Righteous, but the day which is torrible to the unrighteous;
and unutterable is the Glory of the day of the Lord, that shall shine in the
Habitations, and in the Tents of Israel; for Christ our Life is risen, and
arising and appearing in Glory, and we shall appear in Glory with him, and he
will glorify his with the same Glory that he had with the Father, before the
world was yea, Crowns of Lite, Robes of Righteousness, Garments of glorious
Praise, are prepared for the Faithful, for the Chosen, who are true Israclites,
who are Plants growing in the Paradise of God, who are born of the Seed of the
Birth of Life; such shall inherit the Kingdom of everlasting Glory, such shall
triumph in Heaven, having the Songs of praises in their mouths, singing with
Grace in their hearts, before the Throne of the most Holy, Glorious, Wise God,
who is exalting his Name in the Earth, who is establishing his Throne on the
tops of the Mountains: on the Throne of David shall the Prince of Life Reign;
the Spirit of Life has filled me with his Love, to declare to you the glorious
day of the Lord God, whose Light did shine about me, whose Glory, whose
Pretense, whole Life has filled me, the virtue of the Power seel, the increase
of his Love, the ravishing Beauty of the Lord God has overshadowed the Earth,
the Springs of the holy Fountain runs in the Valleys low, where the praises
of God are sounded forth unto his most holy Majesty, in the amiable Habitation
in the Tents of the glory of God, where the Sun shines in his Beauty, where
the Lilly of the Life springs up out of the holy Root, the Righteous Branch of
David, the Kingdom is come, and the new Songs are known, with praises sounded
forth unto the holy One: And in the deep his voice is very sweet, unto the
Hungry is Bread, both Life and Meat. Oh! the depth of Love, which death it
shall destroy, for the Life is come, which leads the narrow Way; And therefore
unto All, I say come away, and prepare unto the glorious day, that into the
Fountain of Life, you all may come and drink, and in Marriage to the Lamb, you
may both join and link: For the Table is both fully spread, the Life is come,
which raises from the dead; And he is risen, the Nations have to healed; Who
in this day his Fountain has unsealed. And Sions Beauty has now ravished me,
therefore I do sound forth the glorious Day, that all may hear the sound
thereof, that they may be gathered that are yet afar off, into the Sheepfold,
where Christ is the Shepherd, who feeds his with ever living Bread, who has
raised many again from the dead, to spread and to publish his most glorious
Name, and to sound forth the Beauty of his fame, that many may be gathered, in
this the glorious Day, for the voice has sounded, which says, come away; for
the life of the Lamb is revealed in great Power, in Majesty and Glory, and the
singing of Birds is heard, with the voice of the Turtle, is heard within, in
this the time of Spring, wherein Summer has appeared, and now the voice of the
Well-beloved is heard; and unto my Beloved, unto Thee, I sweetly sing, as the
Turtle in the time of Spring; who for joy that she has found her Mate, what
from thy love shall me separate? my foul does swim within the Sea of love, as
does the fishes in the water move; and thereby does live, for it is their life,
so to me thou art my joy, and my delight, who art most faithful and most true,
holy and wise, who never forsakes thine. And my friends, my love flows freely
unto you, in God most holy, most faithful, and most true; and in the Life you
may my love feel, which burns from God in virtue and in zeal; which love to you
I do this day sound, which in Echoes sweet, Gods glory and renown, I do send
forth and declare, being fuller than my life can bear, of the waters out of
Jacobs Well, whose waters sweet in virtue does excel; which as honey out of the
Rock does flow, and as Rain into the Sea does go, and Gods voice as the Thunder
does fly, is descended forth as lightning from the Sky; that the sound of it
the Nations may all hear, that before the mighty God they may both dread and
fear: And this is the day wherein the Lord is come, to establish the Kingdom of
his glorious Son; who must Reign over all as Head, even he whom God has raised
from the dead; who under the earth has been slain, but now in Glory is
revealed again; who will vengeance take on all, who would not that he should
Reign; such in the Lake he will throw, with sorrow and with woe: Yea, the day
is come, that God most true, will make a separation amongst the Nations, and
they that shall be saved, shall walk in the Light of Sion, and in the Beauty
and Glory of Jerusalem, the Saints of the most High shall dwell under the
shadow of his Love, in the glourious Brightness, in the excellency of his
Beauty; for the mighty Day is come, wherein over all God will exalt and
glorify his Son, whose Kingdom and Power is made known, whom God will set
again on his most holy Throne; and over all, as King he shall Reign, and before
him his Enemies shall be slain; for the King of all Nations is come, therefore
let all be subject to the Son. And you Babes of the Morning, who are born of
the day of God, this is sent to you all, as the Message of his Love and Life;
whose Springs are freely set open, to all the faithful Worshippers of God; this
I desire may be published with speed, to go through this Nation, as it has
often gone through me as a joyful Sound, sent from the King of Israel, to whom
be eternal glorious Praises for ever, with Hallelujahs unto the holy One, from
whom it is sent and published,

By Dorathy White,
The 20. of the 8. Month, 1661.
Unto thee my Beloved, my streams of Love does slow, as does the Rain, which
into the Sea does go; and the time is come, wherein the Turtle sings in the
Valleys low: And so sweet my streams of Life does run, in beams of Brightness,
descending from the Sun; Glory and Peace does fully increase, from God most
true and just, who is faithful unto all, who in his Name does trust; and in the
pure Life, all his voice may hear, by all that upon him wait, and to him draw
near:This is the day, wherein the Lord is come, with the Bridegroom, so
glorious is the Sun, which is now breaking forth in his glory Bright, to gather
the Nations, to walk in his pure Light: This is the day, wherein Sion has
appeared, and her sweet harmonious sounds, the Nations all must hear; whose
Glory must overspread the Earth, whole Light leads again, and brings from
the Death; whose Power has broke open the graves, and has raised the slain,
to sit on David's Throne to Reign; what shall I say? the depths of Gods Love,
from which Hell nor Death cannot us move; who are of Abraham's stock, who are of
Jacobs Seed, and in the depth of my Life, all my Love may read; which is come
to advance his glorious Name, and throughout the earth to spread his eternal
Fame; that the Nations unto him may come, that they may be gathered by the true
light of the Son; that the blind may now come and see, the glorious light of
the most holy Day, that with the Lamb they may ever Reign, who has raised and
brought from the Dead again; therefore Sion lift up thy voice and sing, shout
for joy, and let thy Name thorough the Nations Ring; for thy King is now come
to Reign, and to sit on David's Throne again; and Life is now revealed, and
Immortality, and the Fountain full, God has unsealed to refresh the weary, the
hungry, and the thirsty drinks abundantly at the full; streams of Life at the
Wellspring of Salvation, the Kingdom is come, the Nations shall be gathered
into the Kingdom, to walk in the Light which leads into the Kingdom, into the
Holy City, into the Bride-chamber; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, the
beautiful Garments are prepared; for the Lambs Wife, the Bridegroom has met
the Bride, and the Holy City is revealed, the Heavenly Jerusalem is come; where
the Harmonies are heard, where the Angels sing before the Lambs Throne, where
the Trumpets of God are sounded forth, where the shouts are sounded through the
Earth, where the voices of Angels are heard as Harps, harping the new Songs;
Hosanna is sung in Sion, by the Tribes of Israel, who sits on the Throne,
judging the Earth, with all its unrighteousness; yea, Victory is come, the Lamb
has overcome the world, he has run the Race, and to him is the Crown given:
And this my Friends is sent to you from God, most holy, most faithful, and most
true; and you all in the Life may feed, and in the deep Gods mysteries come to
read; for my Life is very near to you, with whom I am bound in the Bond that is
true; where my Life with you, up is seal^d, and from God my Mysteries are
revealed; and with you all, I do lie down and rest, sucking at Gods most holy
Breast; for Gods Consolation does evermore abound, where salvation is become a
Crown of Life to me, and to all, who are walking in the day; so the living
voice of the Lord all come to hear, within his Mountain, where the waters
clear, run from Jacobs Well, out of which I drink, and bid you all farewell.

Well-beloved Friends, who are of Jacobs Seed,
In the Love and Life all come to read,
And drink of the Waters sweet, which flows from Jacobs Well,
Whose Waters are as Honey, and in Virtue does excel;
The streams from God, you may all come to feel,
And drink out of the Fountain, which does the Nations heal;
I well know the streams does run within,
Which causes all to rejoice, and in the Valleys sing:
For God most holy is become our life, who has redeemed us from the earth, and
brought us again, who has set us free, into the glorious liberty of the Sons,
and Sonship of Life; so feel the eternal Power, the quickening and inclining
Word of Life, which sets free from the bondage of Hell and death; for

Life to all Sions Seed, whom God is bringing forth, whom God is advancing, whom
God is glorifying; feel the Life of the holy Lamb, in the Kingdom of Gods
glory, that you may know it established in you, that you may know Sions

Life is revealed, and Immortality is come, and Death is swollowed up into
Victory, and the Seed God has raised out of Captivity, where it has been
slain: This is Gods glorious Work, that he is working in the Earth, and a more
glorious Work he will yet work and bring forth; this I do declare in the Name
of the Lord God, that such a Work God will bring forth, as shall astonish all
gainsayers; and they that gaze and wonder, shall be amazed at the sight
thereof, and howl for vexation of spirit; for a day of howling is coming upon
the world; but I say to you rejoice, who are come out from the world; life up
your heads, for your Redemption is at hand: And this I cannot but declare to
you, seeing it so near come, and blessed are all who dwell in the Faith of the

is the Salutation of my Life, in the Love of the Lord God, who am a Babe born
of the same Birth of eternal Love, who live with you in the seed of Life, and
in the Kingdom and Patience of Jesus Chirst, do wait in the Tribulation, and
also in the rejoicing, for the advancing of the Kingdom of God: So Grace be
with you all, Amen: From your Friend,

Dorothy White.

And before him you may all rejoice,
And like Trumpets, lift up your glorious Voice:
And Beloved, our Life is come,
And we shall be clothed with the Beauty of the Sun;
Who is come to reign in his Majesty,
Who is breaking forth, in this his glorious Day;
Who shall reign, and over the Nations spread,
And under his feet, his Enemies shall tread:
So our Beloved is become our Life,
We are his Virgins, and his Married Wife;
Who are to him bound all in one Band,
Who are rejoicing in the Holy Land:
We are come unto the glorious Day,
Therefore all hasten, and to it come away,
That you may all be gathered in,
Into the Palace of the glorious King;
That you all his Beauty behold
That in his Love you may be wrapped and fold.
Christ our Life, is now become our Head,
And by his Power, has raised us from the dead;
And unto us he is become our All,
Who in his Mercy has saved us from the Fall.
This is the Day, wherein glad tidings is come,
Therefore with echoes sweet, sing to the holy One.
All you Babes, born of the Royal Birth,
All ye that are of the Noble Seed, who are set free from Death.
Lift up your Voice, and like a Trumpet sing,
Sound forth, sound forth, the glory of Zions King;
With echoes sweet, give forth the glorious Sound,
Throughout the world, with Glory, Honor, and Heavenly renown;
That many may come and drink of Jacobs Well,
Whose waters sweet, in virtue does excel;
And in Crystal streams, from his Throne does slow,
As does rain descend, and into the Sea does go.
The Rest is come, the Sabbath is known,
Glory be given to him, that sits on the Throne.
And this is a joyful sound, that Immortality is come, that the Life and Power
of Jesus Christ is revealed, in the immortal Glory of God, in the overshadowing
of his Love, in the glory of his Brightness, in the excellency of his Beauty,
he is risen to reign in his Magistical Brightness, who is God over all; Glory
for ever and ever: And this is the Salutation of Life, in the Love that is
endless: Fare you all well.

THE END.
