THE Saint turned Curtezan: OR, A New PLOT discovered by a precious Zealot, of
an Assault and Battery designed upon the Body of a Sanctified Sister, etc.
Who in her Husband's absence, with a Brother
Did often use to comfort one another;
Till wide-mouthed Crop, who is an old Italian,
Took his Mare napping, and surpised her Stallion:
Who 'stead of Entertainment from his Mistress,
Did meet a Cudgelling not matched in Hist'ries.
To the Tune of the Quakers Ballad: or, All in the Land of Essex.
ALL in the Zealous City,
Near the Exchange so Royal,
In dead of Night
Appeared such a Sprite,
Would make a Saint disloyal.
Help Care, Vile, Smith, and Curtis,
Each pious Covenanter,
Now alas what hope
Of converting the Pope,
When a Sister turns a Ranter?
A precious Goose-quill Brother,
Joined with a Holy Sister,
In place of Mate
To propagate
The Holy Seed, he kissed her.
Help, etc.
About the time of Midnight,
When th'Saints are Caterwauling,
The Youngster came
To cherish the Dame,
While the Cuckold was a stroleing.
Help, etc.
For while her Factious Gaol-bird,
That Type of Reformation,
Lay close by the heels,
The slippery Eels
Lay in close Copulation.
Help Care, Vile, Smith, and Curtis,
Each pious Covenanter.
What hopes have we got
To defeat the Sham-Plot,
If a Sister turns a Ranter?
But as the Devil would have it,
The Devil of Lust and Malice,
That night he broke Gaol,
And boggl'd her Tail;
She wished him at the Gallows.
Help Care, Vile, Smith, and Curtis,
Each zealous Covenanter,
What hopes have we got
To defeat the Sham-Plot,
If a Sister turns a Ranter?
For at the usual hour,
In comes the Clerk oth' Quorum,
Where to spoil the Plot,
The Devil had got
Possession long before him.
Help, etc.
My fairest Helen open,
Here Is thy own loving Paris*
Get away from my door,
You Son of a whore,
For here is the old Cuckold Harris.
Help, etc.
Then damn the Factious Lubber,
To spoil our Recreation:
Quoth Harris, what is there?
It Is nothing, my Dear,
But the Spirit of Revelation.
Help Care, Vile, Smith, and Curtis,
Each zealous Covenanter,
Who would credit Ben. Took,
Though he swore on a Book,
That a Saint should turn a Ranter?
The Second Part.
Old Ben who much suspected
'Twas more then a bare Vision,
Began for to peep,
And slept Dog-sleep,
Till he found the Apparition.
Help, etc.
The Covenanting Brother,
According to Indenture,
With Ink in Pen
Came there again
Next Night, but could not enter.
Help, etc.
He knocked beneath the window,
What can you sleep so soundly?
Open, my Dear:
Quoth Ben, are you there?
I Will handle you profoundly.
Help, etc.
In Gown of Wife, and Slippers,
While she lay in a slumber,
Perplexed with cares,
He crept down Stairs,
Armed with good Cudgel Lumber.
Help, etc.
Who Is there? quoth watchful Argus:
It Is I in longing passion,
Give me a kiss:
Quoth Ben, take this,
A Dryden's Salutation.
Help Care, Vile, Smith, and Curtis,
Each zealous Covenanter,
What wonder the Atheist
L'(...) should turn Papist,
When a Zealot turns a Ranter?
What means this strangeness, Madam?
I mean to cool your Courage:
Take this, you Rogue,
I Will send you, Dog,
To hunt for other Forage.
Help, etc.
The Wife scared in the Buzzle,
My Dear, what is the matter?
You're a Whore, quoth he,
You are, quoth she,
A Villain and a Traitor.
Help, etc.
I Will have thee scourged by Baxter,
Quoth he, at the next Lecture,
For prostrating
To any thing
Beneath a Lord Protector.
Help, etc.
Quoth she, I Will have thee Quartered,
Thou Scribbling Factious Felon,
For publishing
Against the King
Sedition and Rebellion.
Help Care, Vile, Smith, and Curtis,
All pions Covenanters,
What hopes have we got
To defeat the Sham-Plot,
When a Sister turns a Ranter?
Have I, quoth he, escaped
The Pillory and Committal,
The Gallows and
The Laws oth' Land,
To be proclaimed a Wittal?
Help, etc.
What will the Bloody Plotters
Say of a Holy Brother,
When we our selves
Lay Traps and Shelves
To Counterplot each other?
Help, etc.
But now for an Expedient,
Lest they should us bespatter,
We Will say the Spark's
A Popish Shark,
And that will salve the matter.
Help, etc.
We Will say he was a Papist
L'(...) had sent to Fire us;
So thou art clear,
My dearest Dear,
And the Saints will still admire us.
Help Care, Vile, Smith, and Curtis,
And each true Covenanter,
What hopes have we got
To defeat the Sham-Plot,
If a Sister turns a Ranter?
FINIS.
