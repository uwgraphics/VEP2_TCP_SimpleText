DVBLIN, Printed by Josiah Windsor in Castle-street. 1669.

To the Most Honorable JAMES Duke, Marquess, and Earl of Ormond, Earl of
Ossory, Brecknock, Viscount Thurles, Lord Baron of Arklow and Lanthony, Lord of
the Regalities and Liberties of the County of Tipperary, Chancellor of the
University of Dublin, Lord Lieutenant General, and General Governor of His
Majesty's Kingdom of Ireland, Lord Lieutenant of the County of Somerset, the
City and County of Bath and Wells, one of the Lords of His Majesty's Most
Honorable Privy Councils of His Majesty's Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and
Ireland, Lord Steward of His Majesty's Household, Gentleman of His Majesty's
Bedchamber, and Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, his Grace.
AS many have written of honor and true renown, as Diogenes Babylonius,
Metrodorus Atheniensis, Plato, Aristotle, and others. So I read of Hieronimus
Osorius Lusitanus, more divinely affected, A Ut novissime, ita eloquentissime
omnium, quorum libros vidimus. Hicronimus Osorius Lufitaenus De Nobilitate
Christiana libros tres scripsit. And Tiraqueb. cap 1.
composed three Books De Nobilitate Christiana ^. The chief aim of that zealous
Author, being to kindle, and raise a flame in all men's hearts and affections,
and to make them in love with true and Christian Nobleness, which once
acquired, as far outshineth all other virtuous habits, as the beams of the Sun
the radiation of the lesser stars. This truth seems to appear in the nature and
name of this high quality. For the Nobles rightly Nobilitatem quasi
Noscibilitatem, prae caeteris notam, claram, illustrem, apertam, spectabilem,
conspicuam, vulgatam, atque hominum sermon celebratam. Festus Bonipeius and
Nonius Marcellus.
presented, ought to be persons of greater wisdom, knowledge, and experience,
so the Civilians will have it. Scire oportet Nobiles, a noscendo dicti, veluti
Noscibiles. Noblemen ought to be sharp-sighted, quick and active, ingenious and
judicious. This is taught from the Sacred Dictates of Gods Law Deuteronomy. 1.13.
which commands, That (...). Septuagint. Ideo Castellio peritos vertit, that
wise men, and understanding, known amongst the Tribes, be made Rulers over the
people. Some are of opinion, that Nonus Marcellus.
Nobilis is used pro noto, as more eminently known. Thus Virgil charactered
Aenaeas, that Trojan Et nos aliquod nomenque de^ cusque Gessimus. q Aeneid.
Prince, as one, whose Name and Renown was great. Some conclude, that he who is
Noble is, Vir clarus of great honor, and fame. Thus the Historian Idem fecit
clari generis, magnaeque dignitatis Vir Fulvi^^. Valerius Maximus. lib. 5. c. 9.
describes Fulvius as a Roman famous for his birth and progeny, and of most
transcendent dignity. Thus Tully, pleading for Rabirius Posthumus, urges in
his Oration, that Clarus, and Nobilis vir, He was a famous and Noble Worthy.
Offilius Calanius had the honor to be styled, Clarus genere, factisque, And to
be in high esteem, both for his birth and breeding, both for his worth in
words, and deeds. Thus the Satyrist observed, Clarus genere atque opibus vir.
In^en. Sat^ 2.
that some Romans were famous, as well for their wealth, as for their birth and
kindred. The Hebrews distinguished their Nobles and Ignobles by two words, the
one presenting Alb^r and laudor qui nomine
light and brightness, the other obscurity and darkness. (...)
Solomon (the most glorious of all Kings) approves lucem accedit. Conti^
this allusion Eccles. 10.17.
concluding, Beata terra cujus Rex est Nobilis, (...).
sive fil^us Nobilium, a tenebris accepta metaphora ad obscuros and ignobiles.
And ^^raq. de Nobil. cap. 2.
Blessed art thou O land, when thy King is the son of Nobles. And in this very
sense, the Wise Man promises, that the diligent man shall stand before Kings,
he shall not stand before mean men. The original bears it more fully, He shall
Prove. 22.29.
not stand before dark, low, and obscure persons: and from hence it is most
probable, that the epithete Illustrious is usually attributed to Kings,
Princes, and Noble men, because as the light it self, their actions and their
passions, their ways, their words, their works, and all their achievements
are more eminent, conspicuous and visible. It was Otho's honor to have the
Historians testimony, that Splendidis ortus Majoribus, Aurel. Victor in vita
Othonis.
he was descended from splendid Ancestors: and to those additions other
adjuncts supervene, as those who are truly noble, have a sublimity of spirit,
and generosity in their souls Quis sublime genus formamque insignis Hetrurci
Nesciat. -- Stat. lib. Syl. 3.
clearly calcined and rarefied from all sordid faeculency, and Plebeian
business. And though Nobility be followed and waited on, with many others,
eminent attendants: yet her chiefest beauty is made up, and the complement
achieved, by virtue and piety; and these two, do not only civilize rude man,
but in some proportion deifie him, and conform the rational creature, in some
proximity, to his Almighty Creator. Bald. Pan^rm.
Hence is raised that Encomium by universal consent and tradition, Omnes
consentiunt bonos mores, sive virtutem, esse Nobilitati anteponendam, that a
civil and sweet comportment, and a virtuous conversation, far out steppeth
Nobility it self. Some others go further in the commendations of virtue, and
boldly assert, that virtue Fatentur plerumq^e virtutem dare causam Nobilitati,
quoniam ad eam conserendam Princeps saepius movetur, and moveri debet illius
virtutibus cui vult concedere. Ba^t. Plat. Rag.
gives an esse and being to Nobility, and that a King or Prince is chiefly
moved, and persuaded by her directions and counsel, to confer grace and favor,
honor, trust and power, upon the merits of his subjects, whose virtues have an
attractive power: and as the Lodestone has a secret magnetic influence over
Princely affections, and their Royal confidence and inclinations. It was from
this firm foundation whence the Noble (o) Romans elevated their thoughts, Malo
pater tibi sit Thersites, dummodo tu sis Aeacidae similis, Vulcaniaque arma
capessas, Iuven. Sat. 8.
esteeming it no dishonor or disrepute, though their birth were as mean as
from Thersites: so their fort^tude and courage, were (at least in some degree)
equal to that of Achilles. It was this, and only this, that forced the Romans
Libera si dentur populo suffragia q^is tam perditus, and dubitet Senecam
praeferre Neroni, Iuven. Sa. 8.
to honor a learned, and modest Philosopher, above, and before a puissant
Emperor. There is yet another jewel that graceth Nobility, and outshineth
virtue it self, and that is piety, and godliness. This is wisdom which is
preferred above scepters and thrones, Wisd. 7.8.25, 26.
A pure influence, flowing from the glory of the Almighty, that brightness of
the everlasting light, the breath of the power of God; he is truly honorable
and most noble, whose soul is embelished and beautified with this grace, which
as the Wise Man says, Omnibus nobilibus nobilior est sapientia, is more
precious then rubies, and in it self is more noble and transcendent then all
the accesses and endowments of either nature or fortune. In the variety of
these manifold reflections, the eyes of many thousands are intentive with
admiration, and their ears listen and hearken after your Grace, as a person
perfectly Noble, and most richly accomplished with the endowments of clear
worth and honor. This truth appears confirmed by heaven and earth, by God and
man; and as it has pleased God to commence his blessings to your Grace, by a
most noble birth and pious education: so it has pleased the Lords anointed, K.
Char. I. K Char. II.
Two Royal Monarchs, successively to confer their highest trust, honor and
power of their Imperial Crown, and of their three Kingdoms, into your Graces
hands and managery: and as their Majesty's trust was immense and great, so your
Graces fidelity and loyalty has been as equally remarkable: for when the
torrents and inundations of treason and rebellion did first break forth in this
Kingdom, your Grace did use your utmost endeavor, to calm and suppress those
superbe and foaming waves: and when they did swell to such a magnitude, as not
to be reclaimed by Royal authority; your Grace (after many dangers and
extremities) did choose rather to endure an exile abroad, then to submit to
disloyal subjects at home, Hault and puissant Seigneur (and so the French
estimate one rightly Noble, and a great soul) rather to choose to adventure, to
lose lands, liberty, life, and to part with the nearest and dearest relations
and concerns, then to hazard the loss of loyalty, or to admit the suspicion of
tainting true honor and renown: And as your Graces fidelity to the Crowns, was
most conspicuous and impregnable: so; your Graces perseverance and constancy to
the truly Catholic and Apostolic faith, your Graces practice and adherency to
your Religion, professed in the Doctrine and Discipline, and to the Liturgy of
the Church of England and Ireland, is most admirable and remarkable. Thus
whilst interest biassed some to a Papal persuasion, and faction carried others
to a Presbyterian Combination, and a third party were deluded and transported
with Enthusiasmes, and the Puffes of new Doctrine, and Phanatique distempers;
it has pleased God to keep your heart aright, in the Worship and service of
his Church, and the true Religion, now replanted by miraculous and Divine
Providence in this Kingdom, These signal testimonies of incomparable worth,
cannot but raise your renown above the malignant breath of either envy or
flattery: (besides others your singular obligations to me) these encourage me
to present to your Graces Patronage and favor, this little spiritual Infant,
which desires to be in your Graces eye, or in your hand, or yet nearer, into
your Graces bosom, when you can spare a minute from your great and high
employments: The subject is, our Savior in his birth, his life, his death in
his Resurrection and Ascension; and, as in a Chart, or Model in this example,
you may see, and measure out much holy advantage to your soul, in a trice of
time, or a short view, which may prove to your future and eternal happiness,
prayed for most devoutly by

(My LORD) Your GRACES faithful and humble Servant, Edvar dus Clonfert. and
Diacens.

pectore, ac innocenti manu, pauperrimae viduae, vel inacuta duo in
Gazophylacium missa, numeravit, and observavit Dominus. Quid obstat igitur, quo
minus munusculum hoc, vel saltem, ut obsequii sui testimonium, vel ut officii
sui argumentum, in gremium matris, (scilicet, Ecclesiae Hibernicae) majori cum
confidentia projiciat filius? In hunc morem, non solum regulis and praeceptis,
sed etiam operibus and exemplis, ducuntur et moventur Christiani; ita ut contra
liberos suos, tanquam inscios, and ignaros, aut quod multo calamitosius, in
impios, and ingrates, merito conqueretur Ecclesia: si honorem and debitam
venerandae Matri reverentiam, praestare negligerent: quod genus observantiae,
tam in ad versis, quam in prosperis concedendum fateamur, and merito in

ab aerugine cordis putrefacti, et obdurati, irruentes agitentur, et sua

adoritur sumus iste sulphurcus, quod tanto clamore, et indignantium strepitu,
bacchati vociferantur, contra Reges Christianos, contra orthodoxos Ecclesiae
Episcopos: hinc est, quod civiles Magistratus ordines, ac dispositiones hominum
negligunt, et contemnunt: quod Leges, Canones, Sanctiones, Juramenta,
Sacramenta, omniaque alia, quae ex conclavi, aut ex suis Conventiculis non
prosiliant, aut ex ingenio suo ac phantasia prae^ipiti, non proveniant; omnino
frivola, superstitiosa, inutilia et inania dijudicant, ac veluti vestigia
Anti-Christi, ^t op^ra Satanica, determinant. (Deus Bone) est in medio lucis ex
protervitate sua caecutiunt impii, et exinde quot, quantisque malis Domus Dei
violari videatur? cum Templum Domini pateat injuriis improborum, qui, ut vulpes
astutiones, aut, ut aprisaevientes, exterminarent: Praedonum manibus, qui sacra
diriperent, Prophanantium pedibus, qui conculcarent, vel indignissimorum
hominum severis censuris et contumeliis, qui (si possent) funditus evecterent,
et avaritia, et ambitione elati, non solum sacras paginas dilacerarent, and
Templum, and Sanctuarium Domini diruerent, sed and dulce nomen Jesus, and Cultum
Divinum in Ecclesia Dei jugiter celebrandum obliterarent, and extinguerent.

Aliud etiam and maximum apparet malum, quod sicut Balaamum stultum, ac vanum
Ariolum asina, stupidum and iners animal, insaniae redarguit: Ita jam modo
rude, et indoctum vulgus e Popinis, tabernisque sectoriis, potoriis fabrilibus
emersum, sacrorum sibi voluminum explanationem, mysteriorumque scientiam,
arcanorum perspicientiam sibi (inquam) vindicat. Et non mirandum est, quanta
audacia fuperba, ac temeritate, illiterati turgeant, cum in Ecclesiam Dei, nova
partenta, ac non prius audita paradoxa comportent et evomant; quo scelere et
flagitio, nihil gravius, pestileni iusve dici, aut excogitari possit. At Deo
Optimo Maximo, gratias, qui, post tot tantasque tempestates circumstantes
undique, and e maligno spiritu concitatas, navem and arcam suam in portum
reduxit, nec ibi solum post pericula, and jacturam naufragii in pace
collocavit; sed, ut Dominus ipse de Aegyptiaca confusione vineam transtulit.
Ita Ecclesiam Hibernicam propria sua manu Deus replintavit; ita Dux itineris
fuit: totam terram implet, operuit montes umbra ejus, extendit palmites, usque
ad mare, and adusque flumen prepagines ejus. Ac ut Christus Dominus, Sponsus
Ecclesiae est in caelis: ita per spiritum consolantem s^mper versatur in
te^ris, qui ita operatur: ut Reges, Imperatores, and Christiani Principes, sint
Patres et Patricii Ecclesiae; nec ii solum, sed etiam Praelati, Antistes, Archi
Episcopi, et vencrandi Sacerdotes, Pastores, et Doctores, et Angeli Dei, vineae
Domini existunt vigiles, et custodes: hoc ipsum annunciat Divus Paulus (Acts
20.27, 28*) (...). Ob hanc causam et rationem, sub umbra Clementiae vestrae hi
pusilli admodum conatus, de dictis et factis, de vita and morte Redemptoris
nostri Domini Jesus Christi sperant paululum acquiescere; vel sub alis gratiae
and favoris vestri foveri, eo tuto ac secure in lucem prodire valiant: and quid
ni succedat modesta and humilis expectatio; cu^ tam been nota vestra sit
humanitas and paterna pietas, ut non solum sublimiores Ecclesiae Hibernicae
dignitates Providentia Dei, and ex intuitu and gratia serenissimi Regis
accepistis, sed etiam strenue, et magna cum vigilia ac sedulitate laborastis;
et quod multo long excellentius per singularia, patientiae indefatigabilis,
constantiae immutabilis et invictae fidei testimonia, acerbissimos Ecclesiae
hosts ac veritatis adversarios superastis: et, Consopitis illorum opprobriis,
et columniis, ut multa perpessa mala, ita procul dubio, pro Deo, pro Rege,

Postremo, nec mirum sit, quod opusculum hoc, qualecunque, ad mutuum refugium
Illustrissimi Pro-Regis, et piissimorum Praesulum ac patrum occurrat asylum,

THe Angels of heaven, as well as the holy Evangelists on earth, sing and set
forth the Birth and Nativity of our blessed Savior.

nature, m that he might be more fitly and fully the Head of his Church, n our
Mediator, and our o Advocate.

God ^he holy Ghost, who did ove^shadow and purify the blessed Virgin, for the
holy Conception, and happy B^rth of our Lord and Savior Jesus. Amen.

4. Contemplation.
THe Evangelists, as exact and faithful Secretaries to the holy Ghost, set
forth the truth, with the place, the manner, the time of the Circumcision of
Jesus.

4. Observation.
CHrist was subject to the Law for us PVer ille Jesus factus est sub lege, ut
eos qui sub lege erant, lucrifaceret, D. Amb. in Luc. De Circumcis. Salvato^.

and that not only to the duties, but likewise to the curses and punishments

circumcisione, Origin. 14. Hom. in Luc. Pluribus de causis circumcisus est

fatur Apollinaris, neque caelitus detulit illud, ut asserit Valentinus; and ut
confirmet Circumcisionem quam olim instituerat, ejus adventui servientem.
Quinetiam, ut nulla sit Iudaeis excusatio; nam nisi circumcisus fuisset,
objicere poterant, quod non possent circumcisum Christum recipere, Epiph.
which we meritted, that he might be as well our Sacrifice as our Priest, to
appease his Fathers wrath Circumcisus est Christus, ut nobis obediendi virtutem

to acquit us from the malediction of the Law, and so to gain pardon for our
rebellions, by his submission and obedience Octavo die consuetum erat carnalem
celebrari circumcisionem; octavo enim die resurrexit Christus a mortuis, and
insinuavit nobis spiritualem circumcisionem, D. Cyril cap. 7. in Lucam.


4. Doxology.
ALL honor and glory be ever devoted and dedicated to Almighty God, our
heavenly Father, Luke 2.31.
who made his blessed Son to be circumcised, and obedient to the Law for man's
salvation; and blessed for ever be the Name of thy holy Child Jesus. Amen.

5. Contemplation.
THe Prophet, and Evangelist; the Law, and the Gospel, as they describe our
Savior in his natures, Divine and Humane; and in his Person, God, and Man: so
they present him wonderful, and magnify him in his proper Name and
Appellation, Jesus.

5. Observation.
Jesus, a Name sent from the King of Heaven, to his beloved Son on Earth,
imposed by God the Father, w proclaimed by an Angel, x foretold by the
Prophets, y recommended to the blessed Virgin Mary, z enjoined to Joseph a at
the mentioning whereof all knees ought to bow, b and to use holy reverence. The
Name Jesus more peculiarly and properly signifying, and representing a Savior,
who should eternally save his Church, and preserve his Saints and Servants from
the sting of everlasting death, and from the jaws of Satan, and from the
torments of hell.

6. Contemplation.
AS the holy Evangelists have presented many admirable truths in the Conception
Genealogy, Nativity, Circumcision, and Nomination of our Lord Jesus: so they
represent him as equally wonderful by many miraculous circumstances, which
accompanied our Savior in his Infancy, which was proclaimed from God to man,
from heaven to earth, in the Heraldry and message of an Angel.

2. Observation.
THe Angels, and Archangels of heaven are celestial Ambassadors, and glorious
Heralds of heaven, c they are Christ's Attendants and followers, d his servants
and soldiers, e ministering spirits sent abroad to obey and execute the will
and pleasures of Christ Jesus their Lord and Master.

visitted and adored by the Gentiles, but thence by the cruelty and suspicion of
Herod, he was banished and forced to fly to Egypt.

10. Observation.
AT the birth of Christ, the Angels expressed their joy, (n) the shepherds

AS Christ in his Birth and infancy amazed the world with his humility, his
patience, his graces and wonderful goodness: so in his Childhood and tender
years, he expressed his duty and obedience to the will of his heavenly Father,

went up devoutly to Jerusalem to worship, and so to fulfill the Law.

12. Observation.
CHrist fulfilled all righteousness, to supply the emp^iness of our errors and
infirm^ties, (c) and in his younger years presented himself a holy pattern and
example of humility and obedience, (d) teaching all Christians thereby, to
begin early to be devout and reverend in Gods worship and service. (e) His

13. Contemplation.
AS Christ went yearly up to Jerusalem to worship in the Temple his heavenly
Father: so he manifested his filial obedience to Joseph, and the Blessed Virgin
his mother in a daily and dutiful submission to their parental orders and
directions, exactly observing the first Commandment of promise, Honor thy
father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy
God gives thee.

13. Observation.
Undutiful disobedience in children toward parents, (f) is dangerous if not
damnable. (g) Therefore Christ offers himself, as a copy and pattern of
obedience (h) to all the sons and daughters of men, guiding them to that honor
and reverence that they owe to their parents; for thus (i) the Scriptures
record of Christ, that he went down with his parents to Nazareth, and was
subject unto them.

CHrist the eternal word, and wisdom of God the Father, went to Jerusalem,
not only to worship, but likewise to manifest his divine graces; and therefore
at twelve years of age, he reasoned and disputed with the Rabbis and Doctors,
hearing them, and posing them, and asking them questions.

14. Observation.
THe beams of the Divine Nature began to (l) radiate, and to shine and show
themselves in Christ, when he was twelve years of age. (m) Then did the rose of
Sharon begin to bud, and to set and send forth his blush, fragrancy and beauty,
(n) being full of the holy Ghost, (o) his graces did overflow, and at that
tender age, the Son of God did dispute, astonish and confound the great
Rabbis, and p^ofound Doctors of the Law.

was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the Devil.

ALL honor be ascribed to our Blessed Redeemer, our Savior Jesus: as for all
his goodness, so chiefly that he was pleased Isa 61.1, 2. Luke 4.18.
to go in the virtue of the Spirit, from place to place, to preach the Gospel,
to work miracles, and to cure his people from their infirmities, and to
dispossess them of Devils, and so to set them in the way to everlasting
happiness: to this blessed Redeemer be all dominion, praise and thanksgiving,
now for ever. Amen.

19. Contemplation.
When Christ had manifested himself to be the Son of God by many miracles, he
called and ordained his Twelve Apostles: the sacred Scriptures set forth their
names, their number, their office, their honor and authority; and the chief
end of their vocation was, that they might be with Jesus, Mark 3.14.
and that he might send them forth to preach, and to have power to heal
sickness, and to cast out Devils.

19. Observation.
CHrist, as he has great honor for God his (p) Father: so has he great care
and tender kindness for the Church our mother; (q) and therefore he chose the
Twelve Apostles, that they (r) and their Successors, Bishops and Pastors, might
feed the Flock (s) o^ Christ, and by virtue of his Commission, preach the
Gospel to all the wo^ld, (t) baptize all nations, and consecrate and administer
the holy Sacrament in a blessed Communion of the body and blood of Christ in
remembrance of (u) Christ's Death and Passion.

AS Christ went about doing of good, and c^ose his Apostles, and appointed
their Successors for the honor and service of his Church* so all h^s works and

one Person, seen partly in his Discourses and Sermons, which were either plain

CHrist though he was the natural and eternal (a) Son of God, yet was he

King, (c) a Priest, (d) a Prophet, (e) he came from the bosom of hi^ F^ther,

willing that all men should learn the Doctrine of Repentance, the new Birth,

AS Christ preached to Nicodemus, so did he, most graciously, to the woman of
Samaria, when he came to a City, which is called Sythar, near to the parcel of
ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph, now Iacohs well was there. Jesus
therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well, and it was
about the sixth hour. John 4.^, 6.


22. Observation.
CHrist was pleased to discourse freely with the (h) woman of Samaria, humbly
to ask her a draught (i) of water, that he might drink, and in recompense of
that slender civility, and in great compassion, does teach her the way to find
the fountain of the (k) water of life, and gives her to drink living waters,
that she might never thirst again. Thus our Savior vouchsafed to converse with
a (l) sinner, a Samaritan; and wisdom it self, to instruct (m) a silly woman,
and thereby the Samaritans were converted, and believed on him.

Righteousness, our Lord and Savior Jesus, blessed for ever. Amen.

24. Contemplation.
CHrist preached the gospel to the multitudes, that they might believe, ^n^ be
saved, but more exact^^ and ^^quently to his Apostles, because they were to be
shepherds of his Flock, leaders of his people, pillars of his Church, and
Confessors and Martyrs to seal his Truth. Therefore did he more distinctly call
them, more completely empower them, more precisely name them, and more freely
send them to preach the gospel, saying, the Kingdom of God is at hand.

24. Observation.
(r) Our Savior taught his Apostles what to do, and what to suffer; (s) how

entertain his Ministers,, (w) and promisetd great rewards for small kindness to

of commanding his Twelve Disciples, he departed thence to preach and to teach
in their Cities.)

25. Observation.

Prophet, be ascribed all honor and glory for ever. Amen.

26. Contemplation.
CHrist, the Lords Anointed Prophet, did show and set forth many miracles, and
preach many Sermons. But he was not so sharp and plain in any, as in that which
he preached against the sins of the Scribes and Pharisees, who have Eight
several woes denounced Mat. 23. v. 13, 14, 15, 16, 23, 2^, 25, 29.
against their hypocrisy.

26. Observation.
IN this Sermon our Savior tells and rebukes the Pharisees, (e) First for
their pride, then for hypocrisy, (f) for their cunning cruelty, (g) [devouring
widows, houses, and for a pretense making long prayers] for their compassing of
Sea and Land to make one proselite, (h) for their blindness and ignorance, (i)
for their craft and dishonesty, paying petty ^ythes to the Church, a^ Mint,
Anise, Commin; but omitting weightier^ matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy and
Faith, for their external cleanness, (k) and their internal filthiness, for
murdering the Prophets, and building and (l) garnishing their tombs; (m) for
being as subtle and supple as (n) serpents, and as venomous as vipers.

AS God complained to Abraham of Sodom and Gomorah, because their sins were
very grievous, Genesis 1^.20.

pride, her cruelty, her disobedience, her irrepentance, and many other horrid
sins, and after threatens her with bitter judgments, and utter desolation.

27. Observation.
OBstinacy, (o) impenitency, (p) apostasy, (q) cruelty, murder, (r) and ki^ling
of Gods Prophets, are remarkable testimonies of wilful, incorrigible sinners,
and most certain provocations and forerunners of Gods heavy wrath and

grievous judgments, and (t) fearful ind gnation.

AS many of Christ's Sermons were plain, personal, and practical; so many others
were allusive and parabolical, as that of the seed, Mat. 13.^, 5.
and he spoke many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went
forth to sow.

29. Observation.
THe seed, alludes to Gods Word, (x) which sometimes falls by the way-side,
then comes (y) the wicked one, Mat. 13.19.
and catches it away, that which was sown in his heart, (z) sometimes to stony
ground, and then the seed perishes for want of root, sometimes amongst thorns,
(a) that is, cares of the world, and deceitfulness of riches, which choke it;
and sometimes the seed falls into good grounds, that is, into the meek ears and
humble hearts of believing and understanding hearers, (b) and they thrive and
bring forth fruit, some thirty, some sixty; some an hundred fold.

Almighty God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

30. Contemplation.
CHrist put forth another parable of the tares, Mat. 23.^4.
saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man, which sowed good seed in his
field, but whiles men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and
went his way.

30. Observation.
Our Savior, and his true servants, sow no seed in Gods Church but pure wheat
(c) the word of grace, (d) and truth, (e) peace and holiness, (f) and faith,
hope, and charity, (g) and the way and means to everlasting life: but the Devil
[the common enemy of mankind] (h) with all his wicked instruments, Atheists,
Heretics, and Schismatics, they sow the tares of infidelity, dissension,
rebellion, and all kind of mischiefs and wickedness amongst the pure seeds of
grace. (i)

IN another parable Christ taught the people, saying, The kingdom of heaven is
like to a grain of mustard seed, which is indeed the least of all seeds; Mat.
13.32.
but when it is grown, it is the greatest amongst herbs, and becomes a Tree,
so that the birds of the air come and lodge in it.

31. Observation.
MVstard seed is a very small grain, but it grows quickly both great and
fruitful, (k) the branches thereof do spread, (l) and prove lodgings and
entertainment for the birds of the air; and thus the pure Word of God, both
grows and thrives in all true Believers hearts, whose branches spread as high
as heaven, and over all the world, with faith, hope, and charity, (m) and good
works of mercy and piety. (n)

32. Contemplation.
CHrist taught the people in another parable, That the kingdom of Heaven is
like unto leaven, Mat. 13.33.
which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was
leavened.

32. Observation.
THe word of God, as leaven hid in meal, is diffusive and apt to ferment, to
season and swell, to incorporate, (o) and to impart its virtue and nature to
the meal and substance, (p) whereinto it is diffused: and a very drop or grain
of grace, as a little leaven, is able to season and sanctify (q) the inward

Mat. 13.^4.
hid in a field, the which when a man has found, he hides, and for joy
thereof, goes and sells all that he has, and buyeth that field.

33. Observation.
THe parables of the grain of mustard seed, and of the leaven, hid in three
measures of meal, set forth the powerful operation of Gods word. But this (t)
of the hid treasure, presents the excellency, the worth and dignity, (u) and
the transcendent value and esteem, which all Christians ought to have on Gods
holy word. (w)

the kingdom of Heaven is not only as treasure hid in a field, but is far
above all precious pearls and jewels, which when the merchant has found, he
sells all that he has to purchase them.

34. Observation.

promising payment, (m) the Lord was moved with compassion, and forgave the
debt. But this great Act of charity, requited with unparalled cruelty upon a
fellow servant, the merciless Creditor, being a large Debtor to his Lord and
King, (n) is justly delivered over to the Tormentors, till he should pay all
that was due: so likewise (o) shall my heavenly Father do unto you, if you from
your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses. (p)

CHrist instructed a certain Lawyer, who tempted him, and seemed to be earnest

Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and
with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thy self.
Christ replied, Thou have answered right, this do, and thou shall live. But the
Lawyer, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
on which occasion Christ presented a parable, saying, A certain man went down
from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell amongst thieves, who did rob and wound the
poor traveller. Luke 10.39.


38. Observation.
MAny Pharisaical and carnal wits are more full of querks and curiosities, then
of any sincere desires of the Truth, of saving grace, (x) or the concerns of
eternal life, (y) and pretending to know the Law, will not know who is their
neighbor; and many who abound with much knowledge, have little or no charity.

40. Doxology.
O Be joyful in the Lord all ye lands, Psa, 100.1, 3, 3, 4,
serve the Lord with gladness, and come before his presence with a song, be ye
sure that the Lord he is God, it is he that made us, and not we our selves, we
are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. O go your way into his gates
with thanksgiving, and into his cou^ts with praise. Be thankful unto him and
speak good of his name, for the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting, and
his truth endures from generation to generation, even so be it. Amen, Amen.

41. Contemplation.
CHrist taught his Disciples how to pray, Luke 1.1, 2
and what to say, both for matter and form, that is, Our Father which art in
heaven, etc. and then preached, and made an Exposition on the Lords Prayer. In
the parable of a friend, Luke 11.5
from whom a neighbor importuned at midnight to borrow three loaves of bread,
pressing the courtesy with necessity, for a friend of mine in his journey is
come unto me, and I have nothing to set before him.

41. Observation.
CHrist is our Mediator and Advocate, (h) full of compassion and mercy, (i) a
most cheerful friend in the greatest w^^ts and miseries, (k) and supplieth his
servants in their most bitter extremities: First, teaching them how to pray,
and then speedily granting to (l) them what they pray for, or else providing
for them wha^ is far bet-better.

great goodness, he is a Comforter, a Father and a Friend to all his children,

42. Contemplation.
CHrist in a Sermon taxed the Pharisees, because they were excessively proud
and covetous; and though they derided him, Luke 16.^3.
yet he taught them, saying, [No servant can serve two masters, ye cannot serve
God and Mammon.] and then was pleassd to enlarge his discourse in the parable
of the rich man, verse 19
and the beggar Lazarus.

42. Observation.
MEn, who are lovers of themselves, are (as Saint Paul observes) ^ Tim. ^.^.
covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful,
unholy, (m) such was the Pharisaical temper, to be a saint (n) in show, but
inwardly a wolf or Devil; or as the merciless Glutton clothed in purple and
fine linen, (o) and fared deliciously every day; when a poor beggar is ready
(p) to starve for want of bread, sadly complaining at the merciless gates.

people. Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth for evermore. Amen.

43. Contemplation.
CHrist spoke this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves, Luke 18.11.
that they were righteous, and despised others. Two men went up into the Temple
to pray, the one a Pharisee, the other a Publican.

43. Observation.
PHarisees and Publicans, (q) holy men and hypocrites, (r) good men and bad
come to Church, and meet in the Temple, (s) [the house of Prayer] at their
devotions: but God knows the thoughts, and searches the hearts of all men,
(t) and as he pleases to justify and pardon humble and penitent sinners, (u)
so he abasheth and punishes proud and haughty Hypocrites.

44. Contemplation.
CHrist said, Mat. 20.1.
The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, who went out
early in the morning to hire laborers into his Vineyard, and when he had
agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his Vineyard.

44. Observation.
CHrist is (Pater-familias) the great Householder of all the world, his Church
(w) is his Vineyard, all men ought to be laborers, and not idle (x) loyterers

evermore. Amen.

45. Contemplation.
AT the conversion of Zaccheus, Luke 19.10, 11,
Christ proclaimed publicly, The Son of man is come to seek and to save that
which is lost; and he added and spoke a parable, and said, The Kingdom of God
should immediately appear, he said therefore, A certain Nobleman went into a
far Country for to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return, and he called
his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy
till I come.

45. Observation.
THe Church of God is his Treasure-house, the Word and Sacraments (b) his
Treasure, all his servants are his Treasurers, (c) their duty is to improve
their trust, to give an account of their time (d) and talents. Idleness, as it
is the daughter of sloth, so it is the mother of shame and forrow. (e) God
gives the light of his grace to man, and man must let that light so shine, (f)
that he may glorify his Father which is in heaven.

46. Contemplation.
CHrist said, The Kingdom of heaven is likened to ten Virgins, which took their
lamps, and went forth to meet the Bridegroom, Mat. 25.1.2, 3.
and five of them were wise, and five of them were foolish. The foolish took
their lamps, and take no oil in them. But the wise take oil in their vessels
with their lamps.

47. Contemplation.
Our Lord Jesus in another parable said, that the kingdom of heaven is as a man
traveling into a far Country, who called to him his own servants, and
delivered unto them his goods; and to on^ he gave five talents, to another two,
and to another one, to every man according to his several ability, and straight
way took his journey.

trusts them with the Treasures of his grace and mercy, (m) allotting to every

AS Christ turned water into wine at the marriage in Cana: so Mat. 21.12.
when he came to Jerusalem, he went into the Temple of God, and cast out all

Money Changers, and the seats of them that sold Doves, and said, It is written,

49. Observation.
Sacrilege, (w) profaness, (x) buying and selling, (y) are abominable sins and

AS Christ was glorious for his many miracles: so was he in his person, to be
highly honored, for many attendances of grace and glory that waited on him: he
was transfigured on the Mount, Mat. 17.^.2.5.6.
in the presence of Peter, James and John, and his face did shine as the Su^,
and his rai^ent was white as the light. A bright cloud overshadowed them; and
behold, a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I
am well pleased, hear ye him.

51. Observation.
CHrist was transfigured, (b) that his Apostles might behold the splendour of
his Divine Majesty, and see on earth a glimpse and beam of eternal glory. He
was transfigured in his body, that (c) we might be transformed in our minds,
and for ever honor and admire him, as the brightness of his Fathers glory, and
the express image of his person.

AS Christ our Savior was glorious at his transfiguration on the Mount; so was
he magnanimous and courageous in the Garden Ioh. 18.3.
over the brook Cedron. For when Judas, with a band of men and officers from
the chief Priests and Pharisees, came thither with lanthorns, and torches, and
weapons, Christ went to them, and said, Whom seek ye? They answering, Jesus of
Nazareth. Jesus says unto them, I am he, at which words, (as if they had been
thunderstruck) they went backward and fell to the ground.

52. Observation.
THe presence of our Savior was terrible (e) as a flash of lightning in the
eyes, and his voice as a crack of thunder in the ears of the guilty officers

AS Christ with his presence, and a word from his mouth, did terrify the bloody
Traitor Judas, and the savage officers and soldiers: so did he in his Doctrine
most sharply rebuke and reprehend the Scribes Mat. 23.33.
and Pharisees for their hypocrisy, cruelty, and covetousness, telling them
plainly, that they were serpents, a generation of vipers, and how could they
escape the damnation of hell?

sins, to call (n) the people to repentance, and to amendment of life, and as

hypocrisy, pride, cruelty, covetousness, oppression, and all other impieties

bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to his Disciples, and said,
Take, eat, this is my body; and he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it

BEfore our Saviors Death, at his Trial, and at his bitter Passion, many

ungodly sinners.

58. Observation.
THe shame and sorrows that Christ endured for man's salvation, and above all
expression or apprehensio^. In holy Job's phrase, (l) Christ says, I am afraid
of my sorrows. In King David's prophesy, (m) The sorrows of hell did compass him
about. In Ieremia^^ Lamentations, (n) See if there be any sorrow like unto my
sorrow, wherewith the Lord has a^fl^cted me, in the day of his anger. In the
Prophet Esaias (o) relations, he was despised and rejected of men, a man of
sorrows, and acquainted with grief. He has borne our griefs, and carried our
sorrows, we esteemed him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. And if the
sumptoms and circumstances of our Saviors passion be examined, they will be
found to be most notorious and terrible; for he was (p) betrayed by his own
servant, (q) conspired against by their chief Priests and Elders, (r) sold by
Judas one of his own Apostles, (s) discov^red in the Treason by a kiss, (t)
app^ehended by the soldiers, (u) led away by Caiphas: (w) forsaken by his
D^sciples, (x) forsworn by St. Peter, (y) bound, and ^o led to Pontius Pilate,
z scourg^d by Pilates command, (a) crowned with thorns by the savage
soldiers, clothed in purpl^, saluted as a king in greater scorn, and then
smitten with their hands. (b) Those bloodthirsty Tygres put a reed in our
Saviors hand, then bowed the knees and mocked (c) him, and then they spit upon
him, take the reed out of his hand, and more him on the head.

AS before our Saviors Death, and in our Saviors Passion; So at his Death and
Crucifixion many signs and wonders were seen, and the most bitter and bloody
proceedings of his merciless enemies are recorded in holy Scriptures, how
Christ suffered and died on the Cross.

58. Observation.
CHrist was crucified, that his servants (d) might be crowned; endured an
ignominious death, (e) that Christians might live gloriously for ever? The
circumstances of time and place, the manner and nature of his Death, his
executioners and companions, do highly justify our Saviors patience,
humility, and charity, and most clearly aggravate the envy, covetousness, and
malice of wicked men and Devils. He was led to Golgotha, as a place for his
Execution. (f) A strange Potion, a mixture of Vinegar and Gall is ministered
unto him. (g) The rude soldiers part his garments, and cast lots for them. (h)
In jealousies and suspicions they watched him when he was nailed to the Cross.
(i) They fixed an accusation over his head. (k) Two thieves were crucified with
him. (l) The passengers and spectators ^ailed and reviled him. (m) From the
sixth hour to the ninth was darkness over the land. (n) At the ninth hour
Christ cried with a loud voice, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me. (o)
When he had cried again with a loud voice, he gave up the Ghost.

59. Doxology.
O Most blessed Lord and Savior Jesus, who wast obedient to the Death, Phil.
^.8.
even to the ignominious and accursed death of the Cross, and did there make
poor sinners peace, by the effusion of thy most precious blood, blotting out
the band-writing of Ordinances that was against us, Colos. 2.14
and nailing it unto thy Cross, that penitent sinners might be saved, and
crowned with immortal blessings. To thee O blessed Savior, for thy great
sufferings, and our salvation, be ascribed, with the Father, and the holy
Ghost, all praise and dominion, and thanksgiving, ever. Amen.

60. Contemplation.
AS before, and at our Saviors Death, many strange and wonderful effects did
manifestly appear; so after his innocent and bitter Death, more and more
strange miracles did succeed, to set forth and evidence, that Christ, Te Deum
Apost. Athan. Nicen. Creed.
who suffered on the Cross, was the immortal seed, and the eternal Son of God.

60. Observation.
WHen Jesus had yielded up the Ghost, immediately after his Death the vail of
the Temple Mat. 27 51.
was rent in tvvain from the top to the bottom, (q) the earth did quake and
tremble, (r) and the rocks rent, (s) the Centurion (who commanded the guards)
was amazed, and confessed, saying, Certainley, this was a Righteous Man. (t)
And again, as Saint Mark relates, (u) Truly this man was the Son of God. And
all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things that
were done, smote their breasts, and returned. (w) Thus Heaven and earth did
bear (x) witness, and seem to sympathize, and groan, and tremble, when the
Son of God had suffered, that the enemies of the Cross of Christ might be
confounded and terrified, if not converted.

humble their souls at the sight of their own sins, and our blessed Savior
Jesus sufferings, and for our salvation by his Death. Let us give him praise
and glory for evermore. Amen.

61. Contemplation.
AS many notable signs and wonders attended before, at, and after the death of
Christ: so these which follow seem more remarkable, and therefore preserved and
placed as Articles of our Creed, that Christ after his Death was buried, that
he descended into hell, that he rose again the third day, that he ascended into
Heaven, that he sits on the right hand of God, and from thence shall come to
judge the quick and the dead.

61. Observation.
THe Scriptures are the Treasure-houses (x) of the riches of Heaven, and the
Church, our Mother, (y) dispenses by her faithful sons and servauts, the
treasure and riches of Gods grace and mercies in the merits of Christ to
repenting and believing Christians, in the ministration (z) of the holy Word
and Sacraments, wherein they are taught (a) the truth of Christ's Burial, and
his descension into Hell, (b) the certainty of his Resurrection, and how then
the graves were opened, and many bodies (c) of Saints which slept arose, (d)
the confirmation of his Ascension into heaven (e) in the presence of his
Apostles, and the holy Angels, (f) the glory of his Session at Gods right hand,
(g) and the final expectation of Christ's coming to Judgment. (h)
