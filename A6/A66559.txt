Cheerful Airs OR BALLADS First composed for one single Voice and since set
for three Voices

BY JOHN WILSON DR in MUSIC Professor of the same in the UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD.

OXFORD. Printed by W. HALL, for RIC. DAVIS. Anno Dom. M DC LX.

THE PREFACE.
SOme few of these Airs were Originally composed by those whose names are
affixed to them, but are here placed as being new set by the Author of the rest.

CANTUS PRIMUS is a complete Book of it self, carrying the principal Air to
Sing alone with a through Base. CANTUS SECUNDUS and BASSUS are also printed
singly to make two, or three Parts, as shall be requisite for the Company that
will use them.

This being the first Essay (for ought we understand) of printing Music that
ever was in Oxford, and the Printers being unacquainted with such Work, has
occasioned the faults hereafter mentioned, in this single Book, the greater
number whereof are the omission of Moods, which are supplied in the other two
Parts, and will be easily mended with a pen in this. The consideration of what
is here premised, with assurance that the other two Parts are more correct, and
a promise of better care in what shall issue from this Press for the future
will (doubtless with unprejudiced Persons) procure pardon for the present
Errata.

To the ever honored Dr JOHN WILSON on his incomparable Book of Ballads.
NOt as a bush to thy more noble wine.
Do we prefix these lines; what ever's thine
Commends it self; we pay our homage, due
To this diviner science and to you:
Did Orpheus Harp cause beasts to dance, thine more
Thy loftier strains draw love from them, before
Did hate thy art and thee: this wonder shall
Raise thee to be a God, make him to fall.
Sure some Intelligence was sent from Jove
T'acquaint thee with the Harmony above;
How else with such composure are we blessed.
It Is Angels Music though in Mortals dress
Those low and creeping words we Ballads call
Thy power has raisd to be celestial.
O prodigy of nature that could keep
Thy soul in tune, when all the world was deep
In discord: it is then time, for thee to set
Some sprightly Air, when there is most need of it.
When sacred Anthems ceased, and in stead
Of that more heavenly Music, did succeed
Nothing but barking tones, when Organs were
By Trumpets silenced, then blown from the Quire;
Thou, borne to humor all, out of thy brain
Full fraught with melodye, did hatch this train
Of songs, from whose sweet concord always runs
Full streams of harmless mirth t'Apollo's sons.
These Charm our senses make our souls to dwell
Upon our ears, there to keep Sentinel.
Here Is Music for the mean capacity,
And for the skillful'st too deep Harmony:
Hold still your penns then, cease for to rehearse
WILSON's deserved praise in untuned verse.
And learn to sing those notes which rightly hit,
Speak more to's honor th^n th'accutest wit.
Proceed Harmonious soul, in this thine art.
More of thy Music still to us impart,
For in these sheets thou shall embalmed be,
And live a WILSON to Eternity.
To my honored friend Dr WILSON on His Musical Airs, and incomparable Skill
on the Lute.
COuld wife Pithagoras taste thy skill;
Or drowned in numbers drink his fill;
Could he [but revel't in thy Air
One hour, he would swear thy soul is there.
Thou Wilt tempt, (take but thy Lute in hand,)
Euridice again to Land;
Who Ravished with one careless glance,
May safely venture the other dance
On fatal Serpents, lul'd in the arms
Of thy soft notes they will need no charms,
Labor but on thy strings, they will throng
Themselves into a Swans last song;
Where every note will ring the knell
Of some dead baffled Philomel.
E. D. ex AE de Christi
On that incomparable Master of Music Dr WILSON.
SIR, such in sounds your skill's, that while you're here,
Oxfords not only Englands eye but Ear:
So at a shake of yours our passions flow,
As if you reached our Heartstrings with your Bow,
Touch your Theorboe, and round all our souls
Like Unisons the restless Quaver rouls,
Your The old Rhetoric Schole now assigned for the Music lecture.
School did never so deserve its name,
As since your ravishing Rhetoric thither came,
No losty style like Ela can command,
No Figures like the postures of your Hand,
How have I seen, souls melting through the Eyes,
Ears chaind, tongues silent at your Melodies.
Like Orpheus Rivers, Beasts, Stones, Birds you move,
When Tears, and wrath, Fierceness, and Winged Love
Follow your Tunes, such Majesty attends
Your strokes, that Law comes from your Fingers ends,
The Spartans Music made them fight and die,
Yours would have made them to graspe Victory.
No wonder then if Poets find their Feet,
When with such all Commanding notes they meet.
Praise is an Echo to good deeds, then fit
It is, good Music should have most of it.
A. C.
To his honored Friend Dr JOHN WILSON upon his most excellent Book of Airs.
LEnd my Muse wings and with them I will dare,
To soar aloft in your much clearer Air.
Where your harmonious sphere is known to move
With sweeter Accents then those do above.
Did now Promethius live he would find a way,
Not only for to animate mere Clay.
Heed ask for pure Air not for Jove's fire,
That he might some harmonious souls inspire.
Musick's compleatest parts you here have set,
Only that we might find them more complete,
Toth' envy of our Nation here you show,
Musicks perfection perfected by you.
To the great Master of Music Dr J. WILSON upon his most excellent Book of
Airs.
THe soul's a Symphony: Th'harmonious blast,
The perfect Air of the great Protoplast.
No wonder then if thy Diviner Note
Betray my soul, make mine invention dote.
Stirred by thy Music from each melting string,
Did thou not Cheat me of my soul, I Would sing,
I Would Praise thy Virtues; but thy sweetest Quire,
Bids me give audience only, and Admire.
Each stroke speaks WILSON and whoever plays
Sings a new Anthem to his lasting praise.
It Is WILSON speaks, each neatly warbled strain
Is but the Echo of the inventors brain.
Not Death, nor Time can e're eclipse thy Fame,
While each string, from thy Book, thus sounds thy Name.
Never fear Oblivion then: Thy Glory shall,
Know none, but what is the worlds great Funeral.
N. M.
To my honored Friend JOHN WILSON Doctor of Music, on his excellent Book of
Airs.
AS Friends do meet whom nobler love has joined
And made (though several bodies, yet) one mind,
Who count themselves to live, not 'cause they move
And have a being but because they love;
Who when they view, think all their souls in the eye.
Or if they touch, think it in the hand to lie:
So do I meet your Airs, they have the art
Of drawing all my soul into that part
Which they affect, and if I chance to hear
Them struck am forced to wish my self all ear.
I do not wonder that the King did When some of these Airs were presented to
him by Dr Wilson Mr Low, and others.
call,
WILSON, there is more words, let us hear them all.
Such was your skill, that what the rest of the Court
Perhaps thought long, Judicious ears thought short.
Excellent Artist! whose sweet strains devour
Time swift as they, and make days seem an hour.
But what need more, since it is enough to tell
But this, King Charles has heard, and liked them well.
J. H. O. C.
To that Excellent Musician the AUTHOR.
IT IS well the Music of the rolling Sphaeres
Does not arive to prepossesse our ears;
That they may entertain thy Nobler Lays;
Which might embodied Angels charm, and raise
Woods into Trances. Let none that at least
Has not a Siren Templ'd in his breast,
Pollute thy songs, And in whose every note
A Quire of Muses plays about his throat:
That may call out the soul and make it run
In a Triumphant Chariot 'bove the Sun.
Could others but discern that Golden vain
Of Art, those Graces that breath in each strain
Of thy composures, then they might know what
(In part) to judge oth' Learned travail that
Teaches thy notes to command Raptures so:
But by that selfe-concealing art (we know)
Thine eyes are priviledg'd in thy frames to spy
Those silken strings, that fine Embrodery.
To my worthy Friend that incomparable Musician Dr JOHN WILSON on his Book of
Songs of three Parts
WHy should I load with barren praise
A head so often wreathed with Bays:
Or make the greedy Reader look
For something good besides the Book?
These dirty lines the rest will soil.
And hardly serve to be their foil,
Yet since the Author will impart
Unto the gaping world his Art;
I Will let it know what it never thought,
What cannot be learned may be bought;
Least men inestimable call
It still and so not buy't at all.
Thus over fair Structures often we set
A Bill, this House is to be Let:
Some too perhaps who yet never knew
Great WILSON what we owe to you;
When they shall on the Title page.
See Ballads first come on the Stage.
Will think, because the word so gross is.
These songs are fit for Market Crosses:
I Will tell'um they are authentic grown,
And Rimers now put Poets down.
And yet I will the Muses call,
Apollo, and the Poets all,
And bid them tell me if they e're
Had better Offerings then are here,
Call any Nobler (if they durst)
Since they frequented Hibla first:
Some humane, More divine; the odds
Is this, men made some, More the Gods.
Thus in a day serene and clear,
Some sullen clouds fixed here and there
Make angry Pheb^s mend his ray
And add more luster to the day.
Thus in fair nights the Heavens are
Not set with one continued star,
But here and there a patch of night
Does recompense the rest with light.
Now could the trembling air convey
These sounds where Troys foundations lay;
Each scatterd stone would show his head,
Though long in ruins buried;
And being ravished leap to take
The station which it did forsake:
And thou (Brave WILSON) with thy hand
Amphion like should charming stand;
So should each higher note have power
For to erect a lofty Tower
And when a deeper tone should sound,
To sinck a Cellar under ground;
Then might I question which would tell
Louder thy Fame, Quart pot or Bell.
I Have done, it is time the Reader see
The difference 'twixt Thee and Me:
I Will only say thy sacred brow
Shall not be crowned with Laurel now,
Stay then till we together can
Thy Master Crown and Thee his Man.

Liberty. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ YOung Thirsis lay in Phillis lap, and gazing on her eye prized life too ^ ^
Mean for such good hap and feign the Lad would dye. When Phillis who the ^ ^
Force did prove of Love as well as he. Cried to him stay a while my Love and ^

Pain that Both to Life immediately return to dye again. ^

^ CAst your Capps and Cares away, this is the Beggars Holiday, In the world
look out and see, where is so happy a King as he, ^ ^ At the Crowning of our
King, Thus we ever Dance and Sing: Where the Nation live so free, And so happy
as do we: ^ ^ Be it Peace or be it War, Here at Liberty we are, Hang all
Officers we cry, And the Magistrates too by, ^ ^ And enjoy our Ease and Rest,
To the Fields we are not Pressed, Nor are When the Subsidy's encreast, We are

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ THoughts do not vex me while I Sleep; Grief do not do ^ ^ not move
me, Smile not false hope while I weep She cannot love me, Had I been as ^ ^
cold and Nice, and as often turning, then as she had I been Ice, and She as I
^ ^ now burning. ^

Tears flow no more from my swollen eyes,
Sighs do not so oppress me,
Stop not your Ears at my Cries,
O but release me.
Were you but as sad as I,
And as full of mourning,
Very grief would make you dye,
At least, leave off your scorning.
^ WHO so complains gains ost Loves just reward. Who so resraineth ^ ^
paineth dyeing Sans regard, then will I make a virtue of my needing ^ ^ And
spare no speech since words cause Loves best speeding, O you sad lines
Proceeding ^ ^ bleeding, show my grev'd heart's exceeding needing. Tell her ^ ^
My sad story, will impair her glory, If she smile when I am sorry. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ COme Silent night and in thy gloomy shade hide my despair all those that ^
^ Trade with grief do hate relief, and can think nothing fair but thy dark
^ ^ Mantle, in whose misty Air Contemning breath they grope for death ^ ^ Oh:
come and stay, banish the light-some day, the harms that are not seen ^ ^ Be
but as though they had not been. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ COme Constant Hearts that so prevail, that every passion putts in bail, my
^ ^ Innocence shall dare as far, to give the Tyrant open war, if warmed with
pride he kindle fires ^ ^ We Will drown them in our chaste desires: If he
Assail with Dart or Bow ^ ^ We Will hide them in these hills of Snow, so shall
his heart plagued Mourn and dye, ^ ^ While we smile at his memory and Keep
our Hearts our Eyes our Ears free ^ ^ From vain Sighs, sad sad groans and
Tears. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ LOve and disdain dwells in my Mistress eyes, contending ^ ^ which of them
shall first destroy m^e, The One with his restless flames my bosom fryes ^ ^
The Other no less does with his Ice annoy me. Dearest, since these conclude
that ^ ^ I must dye, will you not mourn at my sad Obsequie. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ IN a season all oppressed, with sad sorrows poor distressed, ^ ^ Troylous
said unto his Cressed yield O yield thee sweet and stay not, O no no no no no ^
^ No no no Sweet Love I may not. ^

2
Strife in Love is Loves uniting,
These hands were not made for fighting,
But for mutual hearts delighting,
Yield O yield then sweet and stay not:
O No No etc.
3.
Dear if you will still persever,
In this No, which answers never
Do what I desire you ever.
And again say No, and spare not.
O No No etc. I dare not.
4.
Since nor time nor place nor plaining,
Can change this word of disdaining,
What is there for me remaining,
But to dye, if you gainsay not.
O No No etc. I may not.
^ CUpid thou art a wanton Boy, and heretofore made Love a Toy, ^ ^ But in
thy Reign a Tyrant art, to Wound a Sheaperdesses heart: ^ ^ To make her Sigh,
Swoune, Weep, and Pale, Thus Sick yet modest will not ^ ^ Veil; But cries out
Hymen it is your cure, For the blind Boy I Will never endure. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ THough your strangeness sretts my heart, yet may not I Complain, You
persuade me it is but Art, that secret Love must feign. ^ ^ If another you
affect, it is but a show t'avoyd suspect, Is this fair excusing, ^ ^ O no all
is abusing. ^

When another holds your hand,
You swear I have your heart:
When my Rivalls close do stand,
And I stand far apart.
They enjoy you every one,
Yet must I seem your friend alone;
Is this fair excusing,
O no all is abusing.
^ Ask me no more whether does stray those golden Attoms of the ^ ^ day, for
in pure Love the Heavens prepare, that powder to enrich thy hair, Ask me no ^
^ More where those stars light, that downward shoot in dead of night, for
in thine ^ ^ Eyes they set and there, fixed become as in their Sphere. Ask me
no more where ^ ^ Jove bestows when June is gone the flaming Rose, for in thy
beautyes ^ ^ Orient deep, all flowers as in their causes sleep. ^

Nor ask me more if East or West
The Phoenix builds her Spicie Nest,
For unto thee at last she flies
And in thy fragrand bosom dies.
^ CLora's false Love made Clora weep, and by a Rivers side, Her flocks which
Is It not injustice O ye Gods to kindle my desires, And to leave ^ ^ She was
wont to keep neglected thus she cried. Poor victory to pierce a His at so
much odds, as there is no mutual fires. ^ ^ Heart that was a tender one, but
Cowardice to spare your dart from his that was a stone. ^

First part.
As she thus mourned the tears that fell
Down from her Lovesick eyes
Did in the Waters dropp and swell,
And into bubbles rise.
Second Part.
Wherein her blubbered face appears,
Now out alas said she,
How do I melt away in tears,
For him that Loves not me.
First Part.
Yet as I lessen Multiply,
But in less form appear,
Thus do I languish from mine eye,
And grow new in my tear.
Break not the Crystal circles me
Sweet streams by your fair side,
My Love perhapps may walking be,
And I may be espied.
Second Part.
And thus in little drawn and dressed
In a sad tears attire,
May force such passions from his breast,
Shall equal my desire.
^ ILove (alas) but cannot show it I keep a fire that burns within ^ ^ Rake't
up in Embers Ah could she know it, I might perhaps be Loved again, ^ ^ For a
true Love may Justly call for friendship Love reciprocal. ^

Some Gentle Courteous wind betray me
A Sigh, by whispering in her Ear,
Or let a piteous shower convey me
And drop into her breast a tear,
Or two or more, the hardest flint
By often dropps receives a dint.
Shall I then vex my heart and rend it
That is already too too weak;
No no they say Lovers may send it
By wrighting what they cannot speak,
Go then my Muse and let this verse
Bring back my life or else my Hearse.
^ IF I dye, be this my will, Let my spirit serve thee still, and desire if not
fulfill ^ ^ Thy whole pleasure so approving, Death is not the end of Loving.
Let the ^ ^ Earth my Body have whence it sprung, there be my grave, Only the
remembrance ^ ^ Have of my Image; Let death never, me from thy Acquaintance
sever ^ ^ The last Breath my Tongue shall move, be the Ayrie form of Love, And
despite ^ ^ of death approve (life's privation thus defying) if not dead I love
thee dying. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ GReedy Lover pause a while, and remember that a Smile heretofore ^ ^ would
have made thy hopes a feast, which is more since thy diet was incr^ast, ^ ^
then both Looks and Language too, or the face it self can do such a province
^ ^ Is my Hand as if it thou could command heretofore there thy lips would ^
^ Seem to dwell which is more ever since they sped so well, then they can be
brought to ^ ^ Do, by my neck and bosom too. If the center of my breast, a
dominion unpossest ^ ^ heretofore may thy wandering thought suffice seek no
more, and my heart shall ^ ^ Be thy prize, so thou Keep above the Line, all the
Hemispheare is thine. ^

If the flames of love were pure,
Which by Oath thou did assure
Here-to-fore,
Gold that goes into the clear
shines the more.
When it leaves again the fire,
Let not then those looks of thine
Blemish what they should refine.
I have cast into the fire
Almost all thou could desire
Here-to-fore,
But I see thou art to crave
More and more;
Should I cast in all I have,
So that were I never so free,
Thou would burn, though not for me.
^ THine eyes to me like Suns appear or brighter stars their light whih ^
^ Makes it Summer all the year, Or else a day of Night. But truly I do ^ ^
Think they are but eyes, and neither Sun nor Star. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ AWake Awake the Morn will never rise, 'till she can dress her ^ ^
Beauties at thine eyes. The Lark forsakes her watery nest and mounting ^ ^
Shakes her dewy wings taking thy window for the East, and as she ^ ^ Climbes
alost she sings, Awake awake the Morn will never rise 'till she ^ ^ Can
dress her Bauties at thine eyes. The Merchant bows unto the ^ ^ Sea-mans
Star, The Plowman from the Soon his Season takes, ^ ^ Only the Lover
wonders what they are who seek for light before his Mistres wakes. ^ ^ Awake
awake the Morn will never rise, 'till she can dress her beauties at thine
eyes. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ I Would have thee Merry, Laugh, and Smile, and then look grave and sad, ^ ^
In every humor but a while make Love as it is that is Mad, I would have thy
dress in ^ ^ Several shapes, like Proteus carved, not he, in humor a mere
Jack-an-apes, then a grave Monkey be. ^

^ IN The merry Month of May, On a Morn by break of day forth I ^ ^ Walked
the woods so wide, when as May was in her pride, there I spyed all alone ^ ^
Pbilliday with Coridon. ^

2.
Much a do there was god wot,
He could Love but she could not,
His Love He said was ever true,
Nor was mine e're false to you.
He said he had Loved her long,
She said Love should have no wrong,
3.
Coridon would Kiss her then,
She said Maids must kiss no men
'Till they kissed for good and all,
Then She made the Shepherds call:
All the godds to witness footh
Never was loved a fairer youth.
4.
Then with many a pretty Oath
As yea and nay and faith and troath,
Such as silly Sheapheards use
When they will not Love abuse,
Love that had been long deluded,
Was with kisses sweet concluded:
And Philliday with Garlands gay
Was crowned the Lady of the May.
^ Feign would I Cloris whom my heart adores, longer a while between ^ ^ thine
Arms remain, But lo the Jealous morn Her Rosy doors to ^ ^ Spite me opes
and brings the day again. Farewell farewell Cloris it is time I ^ ^ Died, the
Night departs yet still my woes abide. ^

^ Dear give me a thousand kisses pay the dept thy Lips do owe ^ ^ Let the
number of those Blisses to ten thousand thousand grow, 'till to infinites they
^ ^ Flow. Let the sweet perfumed treasure of thy breath my Spirits fill,
enjoying ^ ^ endless pleasures, breaths rebreathing let us still, breathe one
^ ^ Breath, and wish one will. ^

for my Ladds, for To give their Deer's Pinns and Poting sticks ^ ^ Pinns And

^ GO weather-beaten thoughts with storm of tears that issue ^ ^ From your
self conceived sorrow, prize her hard heart, press her unwilling ears to ^ ^
Hear my nights unrest my grieving Morrow. Tell her the harbor where your ^ ^
Selves do dwell, is my poor heart whereon you beat so sore, as does the
clapper on a restles bell ^ ^ Ring for the souls that we shall see no more.
And sighs make known my will is ^ ^ made to her, to her that has my heart for
Legacy. Then burst your swellings home ^ ^ And in smoke vade, to be a witness
to the standers by, that they may testify ^ ^ How much I Loved her, and she
repent that all this never moved her. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ GO restless thoughts fly from your Masters breast, and seek out her that
^ ^ Causes thus my grief, press to her heart, letting it never rest until
from her you bring with ^ ^ You relief. Tell her you come from one, that is
deadly sick a bleeding heart ^ ^ Whose wounds cannot be healed by any others
policy or wit, but by a ^ ^ Love which has been long concealed, Pity
perchance may move this sweet effect, ^ ^ and change her mind into some better
mood. Pray heavens her favor ^ ^ So on you reflect, that in your suit you may
be understood. Then must you ^ ^ Bridle your unruly tongue, and speak her
praises and forget your wrong. ^

Cantus Primus.

^ IF my Lady bid begin, Shall I say No it is a sin? ^ ^ If she bidd me
Kiss and play, Shall I shrink? Cold Fool away. ^ ^ If She clap my Cheeks
and spy little Cupids in my eye gripe my hand and ^ ^ Stroke my hair, shall
I like a faint heart fear. No, no, no, let those that ^ ^ Lie in dismal
dungeons and would dye, despair and fear, Let those that ^ ^ Cry they are
forsaken and would fly, quit their fortunes mine ^ ^ Are free, Hope makes me
Hardy, so does She. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ TEll me where the beauty lies in my Mistress, or mine eyes, is she fair
^ ^ I made her so, Beauty does from likeing grow. Be she fayrer whiter than ^
^ Venus Doves or Leda's Swanne, What Is that Beauty if neglected, seen of all,
of ^ ^ None respected. Then let my Mistress that I love her, think her fair ^
^ Cause I approve Her. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ BOast not blind boy that I Am thy prize, 'twas not thy Dart but those that ^
^ Feathered with her eyes first struck my heart. The Will tuter'd shafts and ^ ^
Childish Bow, on faintly loving hearts bestow. ^

I Vaunt my flame and dare desye
Those Bugbeare fires,
Which only serve to terrify
Fools fond desires:
Hoard up for such thy painted flame,
As tremble when they hear thy name.
My heart thy fire nor shafts could pierce,
But holy flashes,
Swifter then lightning and more fierce,
Burnt mine to ashes;
Where let them sleep in unknown rest,
Since Fate concludes their Urne her breast.
^ COme thou Father of the Spring: Come Zephirus, and while we sing ^ ^ Spread
thy Nectar-dewed wings over all this place below, that from hence such ^ ^
Sweet may grow, Hybla shall envy at the show, that the Nymphs and higher ^ ^
Powers may cast their eyes out at their Bowers, and descend to pluck thy
Flowers, ^ ^ Whence a rich perfume shall rise, to swell the Air and pierce the
Skies ^ ^ Sweeter then a Sacrifice. ^

Cantus Primus.

^ SIr this my little Mistress here, did never pretend to Peter's Chair, nor
No Benefice she ever sold, nor Pardon, nor dispense for Gold, she ^ ^ Any
Triple Crown did wear, and yet she is a Pope. No Kings her Scarcely is a
quarter old, and yet she is a Pope. ^ ^ Feet did ever Kiss, or had worse
looks from Her then this. Nor does she ever ^ ^ Hope, to Saint men with the
Rope, and yet she is a Pope. ^ ^ A female Pope, you will say a second Ioane, but
sure this is Pope Innocent or none. ^

^ NO No I tell thee no, Though from thee I Must go, Yet my ^ ^ Heart says
not so. It swears by Stella's eyes, in whose darting surprise ^ ^ It in Loves
fetters lies. It swears by those Roses and Lillies so White, ^ ^ And those
Rubies so Bright, Never to part never to part from my ^ ^ Dear dear delight. ^

Cantus Primus.
R. Johnson.
^ FOr ever let thy heavenly Tapers on the Married brightly shine ^ ^ And never
may un-sacred vapors drown those glorious flames of thine. O Hymen ^ ^ That
their Hands, their Hands do join until thy Rays to darkness turn, ^ ^
With thy high Praise, with thy high praise, our hearts shall burn, our ^ ^
Hearts shall burn. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ FLy hence shadows that do Keep watchful sorrows Charmed in sleep, ^ ^
Though the eyes be overtaken yet the heart does ever waken, thoughts charmed ^
^ Up in busy snares of Continual toils and cares, Love and griefs are so
expressed, ^ ^ That they rather sigh then rest. Fly hence shadows that do keep
watchful ^ ^ Sorrows charmed in sleep, Watchful sorrows charmed in sleep. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ SInce Love has in thine and mine Eye Kindled a holy flame, ^ ^ What Pity
'twere to let it dye, what sin to quench the same. ^ ^ The stars that seem
extinct by day, disclose their flames at night, and in a ^ ^ Subtle sense
convey their Loves in beams of light. ^

3.
So when the Jealous Eye and Ear,
Are shut or turned a side:
Our tongues, our Eyes may talk nor fear
The being heard or spied.
4.
What though our bodies cannot meet,
Loves fuell's more divine,
The fixed stars by their twinkling greet,
And yet they never join.
5.
False Meteors that do change their place,
Though they seem fair and bright,
Yet when they covet to embrace,
Fall down and loose their light.
6.
If thou perceive thy flame decay,
Come light thine Eyes at mine:
And when I feel mine fade away,
I Will take new fire from thine.
7.
Thus while we shall preserve from wast,
The flame of our desires,
No Vestall shall maintain more chaste,
Or more Immortal fires.
^ SInce Love has brought thee, and I have caught thee here in this bower ^ ^
And at this Hour, Nor shall thy faynings, thy coy disdaynings thy causeless ^
^ Chidings, thy short abidings, thy crafty smilings thy quaint beguilings, ^ ^
Nor those thy struglings, with all thy juglings shall make me ^ ^ Leave thee
No No thou shall no more deceive me. ^

2.
See thou that fountain, Under that Mountain,
Wat'ring those vallyes, Along whose allies,
Thou once did fly me, when I did spy thee,
Even in this Atire, Held by a Satyr:
Under that Sapling, In a close grapling,
When I did threat him, and after beat him,
And yet would leave me,
No, No, thou shall no more deceive me.
3.
Then cease thy panting, And be not wanting,
In those sweet graces, and dear embraces,
Wherewith thou bindest, all that thou mindest,
And fall a Billing, 'till I be willing,
So to repay thee, that which may stay thee,
And so delight thee, that to requite me,
Thou never wilt leave me,
Nor ever offer to deceive me.
^ YOu Heralds of my Mistress heart, beauties fairest jewel, to me her ^ ^
Passions force impart, that I may know if She or no, in-tendeth to be ^ ^
Cruel, your silence can with art express, the heart's unfeined story ^ ^ When
modest tongues fear to confess then daring eyes can best devise enchanting ^
^ O-ra-to-ry. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ WHy think thou Fool thy Beauties Rays should flame my colder ^ ^ Heart
when thy disdain shall several ways such peircing blasts impart see not
those ^ ^ Beams that guild the day, though they be hot and fierce to have
neither heat ^ ^ Nor power to stay, when winds themselves displerce, So
though thine ^ ^ Eye heates my desire, yet know thy coy disdain falls like a
storm on ^ ^ That young fire, and blows me cool again. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ WHen the clear Sunn with his beams hot, Scorched the ^ ^ Grass in Meade and
Mountain, Strephon the Sheapheard now forgot, late sitting by a ^ ^ Crystal
fountain under a spreading Beeches shade, for Phyllis ear this ^ ^ Ditty
made; Farewell farewell false and untrue Love, light as the wind ^ ^ Soon
changed for new love. So long as I was in your sight I ^ ^ Was your life, your
heart, your treasure, and with feigned eyes you moan'd and sighed ^ ^ As in
flame burning past all measure, three days endured this love to me, and ^ ^
It was lost in other three. Farewell farewell etc. Soon as another Swayne you ^
^ Saw, who may by love or likeing feigned, you 'gan from me your love
withdraw, ^ ^ and soon my place he had obtained. Then came a third your love to
^ ^ Win, and we were out and he was in. Farewell etc. Doubtless you bear your
^ ^ Self in hand, because of loves you breed such plenty, to fill with new
loves ^ ^ All the Land, and all the World if it were empty, But O you do your
self be-guile, ^ ^ because they live so short a while, Farewell farewell etc. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ WHat would any man desire? is he cold? then here is a fire ^ ^ Is he hot?
she will gently scoole him 'till he find that heat does cool him, Is he ^ ^
Sad? then here is a pleasure, is he poor? then here is a treasure. Loves he
Music? ^ ^ Here Is the choice of all sweet sounds in her sweet voice. Does he
hunger, here is a ^ ^ Feast to which a God might be a guest, and to those
Viands if he thirst, here is ^ ^ Nectar for him, since the first of men that
was for sin a deptor, never any ^ ^ Tasted better. Here Is all complete from
head to heel, to hear, to see, taste ^ ^ Smell or feel. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ THou that excellest and sweeter smellest then budding Roses yet ^ ^ Cruelly
killest, others sit billing, Loves Nectar spilling, why should thou then to
me ^ ^ Prove so unwilling, thy looks so smiling, all hearts beguiling ^ ^
Kindled the fire of my desire. ^

2.
Then be not cruel, my Loves chief Jewel,
Quench the flames thou have made, or give them fuel,
All those that knew me, when they shall view me,
With death rewarded, will curse her that slew me.
O let relenting, and swift repenting,
From danger free, both thee and me.
3.
Then we will lie gasping, Arm in arm clasping,
Of Loves Sweets that have past each others asking,
Our hearts united, this way delighted,
Shall not with needless fear, no more be frighted.
But with sweet Kisses, multiply blisses,
Until we prove, one soul in Love.
^ I Swear by Muskadell, that I do Love thee, well and more then I can ^ ^
Tell, by the white Clarret and Sack, I do love thy Black black black, I do ^
^ Love thy black black black. ^

2
So lovely and so fair
Ore shaddow'd with thy hair,
So nimble just like hair,
All these set me on loves rack,
For thy sweeter Black black black.
3.
No goddess amongst them all,
So slender and so tall,
And graceful too withal,
Which makes my sinews to Crack,
For thy dainty Black black black.
4.
Thy kind and loving Eye,
When first I did Espy,
Our loves it did descrye,
Dumb speaking what do you lack,
Mine answered thy Black black black.
^ Fondness of man to love a she, were beauties Image on her ^ ^ Face so
carved by Im-mor-ta-li-ty, as en-vious time cannot disgrace. ^ ^ Who shall
weigh a Lovers pain, feigned smiles a while his hopes may steer but soon
reduced ^ ^ by sad disdain to the first principles of fear. ^

Then farewell fairest never will I,
Pursue uncertain blisses more:
Who sails by woman's constancy,
Shipwracks his Love on every shore.
^ Down Be still you Seas, water your dread master please, ^ ^ Down down I
say or be silent as the day, you that fling and roar a loft ^ ^ Whistling
winds be still and soft, not an Angry look let fly, you proud Mountains ^ ^
Fall and dye. Tumble no more, nor kick nor Roar, nor trouble her ^ ^ Keele to
make her reele, but safe from Surges, Rocks and Sand, Kiss her and ^ ^ Stroke
her, and set her a Land. ^

J. Wilson.
^ YOu say you love me, nay can swear it too, but stay Sir, ^ ^ 'Twill not

I Will keep my Freedom all I can, and never live a Mar-ri-ed man ^ ^ You that
have servile minds may marry and con-fine your selves to one ^ ^ I will not
from my nature vary, which like a thousand yet Love none ^ ^ But keep my
freedom all I can, and never live a Married man. ^

^ SO have I seen a Silver Swann, as in a watery looking ^ ^ Glass, viewing
her whi-ter form and then, Courting her ^ ^ Self with lovely grace. As now

^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ VIew'st thou that poor penurious pair of Lovers how they ^ ^ Bill,
Instructed not by wanton fair, but by a Mutual will. ^ ^ Such needless aids
these Wretches scorn, they find out hid desires, ^ ^ which in each others
mind being borne begets them to new fires. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ IF I must tell you what I love before my heart shall bow to any ^ ^ It Is not
the Black that I approve, nor yet the Brown adored by many The first is ^ ^
Far from all de-light, it is beauties foe and not com-plexion, The Emblem ^ ^
Of sad care and night, still moveing horror not affection. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ WHen on mine eyes her eyes first shone, I all amazed steadily ^ ^ Gazed, and
she to make me more amazed so caught so wove four eyes in one as ^ ^ Who had
with advizement seen us would have admired Loves equal force between ^ ^ us,
But treason in those friendlike eyes, my heart first charming and then
disdaining, ^ ^ so charmed it e're it dreamt of Harming, as at her mercy now it
^ ^ Lies and shows me to my endless smart, she loved but with her eyes I
with my heart. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ BE not thou so foolish nice, as to be in-vi-ted twice ^ ^ What should
Women more incite then their own sweet Appetite, shall Savage things more ^ ^
Freedom have, then Nature unto Women gave. The Swan the Turtle, and the ^ ^
Sparrow, Bill a while then take the Marrow; They Bill and Kiss, what ^ ^ Then
they do, Come Bill and Kiss and I Will show you. ^

Cantus Primus.

^ COme I faint thy tedious stay doubles each hour of the ^ ^ Day, the Nimble
have of winged love, makes aged time not seem to move. ^ ^ Did not the night,
and then the light, instruct my sight, I should forget the Sunn, ^ ^ For-get
his flight. Show not the drooping Marigold, whose Leaves like doleful Arms
do ^ ^ Fold, my longing nothing can ex-plaine, but Soul and Body rent in
twain. Did I not ^ ^ Moan, and sigh and groan, and talk alone, I might
believe my Soul from home were gone. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ GOd Lyeus ever young, ever Honored ever sung, ^ ^ stained with Blood of

^ NOt Roses coucht within a Lilly bed, are those commixtures ^ ^ That depaint

^ ^ Fondly deemed of heavenly race, have from my guiltless Blood which thou
have ^ ^ Shed, and envies palenesse got thy white and Red. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ SO many Loves have I neglected, whose good parts might move ^ ^ Me, that
now I am of all re-ject-ed, there is none will Love me. ^ ^ Why is Maiden heat
so coy, it Freezeth when it burns, loosing what it ^ ^ Might enjoy and having
lost it mourns. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ NOw the Lu-sty Spring is seen, green, yellow, gaudy blue, daintily in-vites
^ ^ the view on every Bush on every green, Roses blushing as they blow ^ ^
And inviting men to pull, Lillies whiter then the Snow, Woodbines ^ ^ With
sweet honey full. All Loves Emblemes, and all cry Ladies if not ^ ^ Plucks you
dye. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ WHerefore peep'st thou envious day, We can Kiss without thee, ^ ^ Lovers
hate that golden ray, that thou bear about thee. Go and give them ^ ^ Light
that sorrow, or the Saylor flying, our Embraces need no Morrow ^ ^ Nor our
pleasures Eying. ^

2.
We shall curse thy curious Eye,
For our soon betraying,
And condemn thee for a spy,
If thou see us playing.
Get thee gone and Lend thy flashes,
Where there is need of lending.
Our affections are not ashes.
Nor our Kisses ending.
3.
Were we cold or withered here,
We should wish thee by us,
Or but one another fear,
Then thou should not fly us.
We are young thou mar'st our pleasure,
Go to Sea and slumber,
Darkness only gives us leisure,
Our stolen joys to number.
^ Turn Turn, turn thy beauteous face away, how pale and sickly looks the ^
^ Day in emulation of thy brighter Beams. O envious light fly fly begone ^ ^
Come Night and join two breasts in one, when what Love does we will re-peate ^
^ in dreams. Yet thine eyes open, who can day hence fright ^ ^ Let but their
Lidds fall and it will be night. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ WHen I behold my Mistres face, where beauty has her dwell-ing place, ^ ^
And see those seeing stars her eyes, In whom Loves fire for ever lies. ^ ^
And hear her witty Charming words, her sweet Tongue to mine Ear affords ^ ^
Me thinks he wants Wit, Ears, and Eyes, whom Love makes not Idolatrize. ^

Cantus Primus.
J. Wilson.
^ MY Love and I for Kisses played she would keep stakes ^ ^ I was content,
but when I wonn she would be paid, this made me ^ ^ Ask her what she meant.
Nay since I see quoth she I see quoth ^ ^ She your wrangling vain, take your
own Kisses and I Will take mine a-gaine. ^

^ IN a vale with flowrets spangled,
To the Nymph that had entangled,
Strephon meeting her thus lained
And to her his Bosom Chained,
^ ^ Tarry O tarry fair at the sigh's at the prayre of who thy dear eyes
adm'res Hark how each thing we see do all discourse of she, so thy beauty
all Inspires. ^ ^ The Birds thy praises sing smooth winds the blessing
acknowledge to thy breath The Earth says thou art their spring, each flower
confessing their sent and Color was ^ ^ Of their sweet breathing. Of thy
be-queathing. ^

Thus sung he, but the Nymph fled him,
Him and all his praises scorning,
Wherefore as his anger led him
To dispraise his praises turning,
Stay cruel stay he cries,
And let thy Ears and Eyes,
Of thy faults the Records be.
And those that praised thee late,
See how thy Scorns they hate.
In their due remorce of me.
Hark the Birds cry like th'Owle, thou art all their wonder,
The winds would blow thee hence thy absence hasting,
The Earth says thy frowns are but a dartlesse thunder,
Flowers smile, nor fear thy frosty bosoms blasting.
FINIS.
