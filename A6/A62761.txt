To the KINGS Most Excellent MAJESTY.
The humble Address of the Magistrates and Council of His Majesty's City of
Edinburgh, for themselves, and in name of the whole Inhabitants thereof.
May it please Your Majesty,
WHen we reflect on the joyful Acclamations with which the News of Your
Majesty's Succession to the Crown, were received in this Capital City of Your
Majesty's Ancient Kingdom, notwithstanding of the sad Loss which made way for
it; And with what profound Peace and Quiet these Acclamations are still
followed here: We cannot but bless the Almighty God by whom Kings Reign, and by
whom that Royal Line under which we have been so long happy, is now lengthened
to one degree further by your Glorious Addition, Your Majesty b^ing now the III
Monarch of that Royal Race; Having also reason to expect from Your Justice and
Clemency which we our selves were so happy as to see when we were Governed by
your Majesty's immediate Influence. That your Majesty's Inclinations are as good
as your Title, and that Your great Prudence is able to foresee, and Your great
Courage able to overcome all these desperate Designs which tend to make us
Atheists, under the pretext of Religion, and Slaves under the pr^text of
Liberty. We do therefore from joyful hearts Congratulate Your Majesty's happy
Ascent to the Throne of Your Ancient and Royal Ancestors; And as this City had
from their Bounty their large Privileges, So we hope from Your Majesty's
Justice and Kindness the free Exercise and happy Continuation of them. In
Recognizance whereof we shall be always ready to employ our Lives and Fortunes
in Your Majesty's Service, and to pray the Almighty God to preserve You from
the Malice of Your Enemies, and to make you a Blessing to Your Dutiful Subjects.
