The Young-Mans Trial: Or, Betty's Denial,
They loved, they liked, but did not Wed, which made the Young Man sad:
But if he finds a Maidenhead, it is that will make him glad.
To the Tune of, The fits come on me now.


OH fie upon Cupids skill,
for with his politic Dart
He did command my will,
and pierced my tender heart.
I loved a Lass of late,
but could not be loved again:
I cho^ her to be my Mate,
but that proved labor in vain.
O I have bin over the Water,
and I have bin over the Sea,
And I have done more for Betty
then Betty will do for me.
When first a Suitor I came,
she modestly did deny;
But love my heart did inflame,
that further I meant to try.
I asked her free good will,
but she a little did mock;
But had she been constant still
I Would bought her a Holland Smock.
O I have bin over the Sea, etc.
As Lovers do lovingly play,
so sweetly we two did kiss,
And kindly to h^^ ^ did say.
Sweetheart, how like thou this?
I bought her a Hat and a Gown,
I ga^e her a Golden Ring;
But if I should lay her down,
I Would give her a better thing.
O I have, etc.
Sometimes she would merrily talk
and like to the Nightingale sing.
In the fields we often did walk
which delicate pleasure did bring.
Sometimes she would give me a kiss,
and then must dally a while:
No harm was done in all this,
which made my worship to smile.
O I have, etc.
Her Cheeks were like the Rose,
her Lips as red as a Cherry;
If we had no worser Foes
'twould make us all full merry,
Her Hair like threads of Gold,
has fettered me in a Iin;
I cannot get out of her hold,
though easily I went in.
O I have bin over, etc.
The ^^co^d Part,
To the same Tune.


(...) Saint,
(...) wears no curled locks,
Though many their faces paint,
and are powdered with a Pox:
She Is witty, wary and wise,
she is nimble, pretty, and coy;
And yet I perceive by her eyes,
she longs for a chopping Boy.
O I have bin over the Water,
and I have bin over the Sea,
And I have done more for Betty
then Betty will do for me.
Some wenches are wanton and wild,
whose middles you quickly may span
Yet some would fain have a child,
without the help of a man.
But what makes a woman to joy,
being freed from troubles and harms,
When she has a pretty fine Boy
to Lullaby in her arms.
O I have, etc.
If Betty had lovingly done,
and wedded with me before,
She now might have had a Son,
a Daughter or two that is more:
She loses her teeming time,
as other fair Maidens do,
O that is a horrible crime,
and a pitiful treason too:
O I have bin over the Water,
and I have bin over the Sea,
And I have done more for Betty,
then Betty will do for me,
If Betty will still stand out,
I Will go a wooing to Nan,
She Is willing without any doubt
to lie by the side of a man:
Or else I will go unto Kate,
and take her about the middle;
I heard her speaking of late
for one to play on her Fiddle.
O I have. etc.
I Will speak to Nelly and Rose,
to Mary, Susan, and Grace,
To Ginny, or any of those
that lovingly will embrace:
To Frances, Bridget, and Doll,
to Esther, Parnel, and Joan;
And when I have wooed them all,
I Will wed them every one.
O I have bin over the Water,
and I have bin over the Land,
And I have done more for Betty
then Betty will understand.
Finis.
