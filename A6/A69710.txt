HIs Majesty taking notice of an Order lately made by the House of Commons,
whereby that house has unduly assumed to themselves Authority to order, direct,
and dispose of One hundred thousand pounds, part of those Moneys which the
Adventurers for the redressing of the Rebels of Ireland have paid to that end
only to that purpose, To other uses and intents, contrary to the express
words of the Act of Parliament concerning the same; Wherein it is enacted, That
no part of the Money which should be paid in according to that Act, shall be
employed to any other purpose, then the reducing of those Rebels, until they
shall be declared to be subdued, out of His piety and Princely care for the
confirming and re-establishment of Gods true Religion in that His Kingdom of
Ireland; For, the relief of His distressed Subjects there, for the suppressing
of that horrid and bloody Rebellion, for the supply and payment of His Armies
there, now in great want and necessity; Does strictly require the House of
Commons, as they will answer the contrary to Almighty God, His Majesty, and
those that have trusted them, That they immediately retract that mischievous,
Illegal and unjust Order, wherein His Majesty expects their speedy Answer
and Obedience; And the rather that he may thereby be secured, that such part of
the Four hundred thousand pounds as is or shall be collected from His good
Subjects of England, by virtue of the late Act of Parliament, whereby the same
is granted, may not likewise (under false pretenses) be diverted from its
proper use, for which it was intended, and mis-imployed to the disturbance of
the Peace of this Kingdom in a War against His Sacred Majesty.

THE ANSWER OF The House of Commons TO HIS MAJESTY'S MESSAGE.
THe House of Commons having received a Message from His Majesty of the 13th
of August last, whereby they are required to retract an Order made by them for
the borrowing of One hundred thousand pounds of the Adventurers Money for
IRELAND, supposing that Order very prejudicial to the affairs of Ireland, and
contrary to an Act of Parliament made this present Session; Do in the first
place Declare, That these directions given by His Majesty for the retracting
of this Order, is an high breach of Privilege of Parliament; And that they
cannot without a deep sense of sorrow, call to mind how Popish and Prelaticall
Counsels did so far prevail with His Majesty, that two Armies were brought
within the bowels of this Kingdom, and two Protestant Nations ready to welter
in each others blood; That when both those Armies had been a long time defrayed
at the charge of the poor Commons of England, and at length by Gods blessing
upon the endeavors of the Parliament quietly disbanded, the same wicked
Counsels (prevented of that design) did soon after raise this bloody and
barbarous Rebellion in Ireland: The suppressing whereof (for the better-colour)
was recommended to the care of the Parliament, who, out of a fellow-feeling of
the unspeakable miseries of their Protestant Brethren there (not suspecting
this horrid Plot, now too apparent) did cheerfully undertake that great work,
and do really intend and endeavor to settle the Protestant Religion, and a
permanent Peace in that Realm, to the glory of God, and the great honor and
profit of His Majesty, and security of His three Kingdoms: But how they have
been discouraged, retarded, and diverted in and from this pious and glorious
work, by those Traitorous Counsels about His Majesty, will appear by many
particulars, some whereof they shall upon this just occasion call to
remembrance.

That when the Lords and Commons had upon the first breaking out of the
Rebellion, immediately provided and sent over Twenty thousand pounds, and
engaged themselves and the whole Kingdom for the reducing of the Rebels: Yet
His Majesty after His return from Scotland to London, was not either pleased
by Word or Message to take notice of it, until after some in the House of
Commons had truly observed how forward those mischievous Counselors were to
incite His Majesty against His Protestant Subjects of Scotland, and how slow
to recent the proceeding of His Papist Traitors in Ireland.

That although the Rebels had most impudently styled themselves, The Queens
Army; and professed that the cause of their rising was, to maintain the Kings
Prerogative, and the Queens Religion, against the Puritan Parliament of
England. And that thereupon both Houses of Parliament ^^d humbly and earnestly
advice His Majesty to wipe away this dangerous scandal, by proclaiming them
Rebels and Traitors to His Majesty, and the Crown of England, which then would
have mated and weakened the Conspirators in the beginning; and have encouraged
both the Parliament here, and good people there, the more vigorously to have
opposed their proceedings: Yet such was the power of those Counsels, that no
Proclamation was set forth to that purpose, till almost three Months after the
breaking out of this Rebellion, and then command given, that but 40 should be
printed, nor they published till further directions should be given by His
Majesty.

That after both Houses of Parliament had found out a probable way to reduce
the Kingdom of Ireland, by the Adventure of private men, without any charge to
the Subject in general, and which they are very confident would have brought
in a Million of Money (had His Majesty continued in or near London) those
malicious Whisperers, that durst not hinder the passing of the Bill, which was
so specious in it self, and so generally approved: Yet have by practice, by
drawing His Majesty from His Parliament, by keeping Him at this distance, and
advising Him to make war upon His people, so intimidated and discouraged the
Adventurers and others that would have adventured, that they have rendered that
good Bill in a manner ineffectuall.

That the Parliament and Adventurers had long since designed five thousand
Foot, and five hundred Horse for the relief of Munster, to be sent as a
Brigade, under the command of the Lord Wharton; had made choice and listed all
the Commanders, and prepared Money, Arms, and other Provision for that
Expedition, and all to be at the charge of the Adventurers: And when nothing
was wanting but a Commission to the Lord Wharton, to enable him for that
service, such was the power of those Counsels, that no Commission could be
obtained from His Majesty; by reason whereof Lymrick was wholly lost, and the
Province of Munster is now in very great distress.

That when diverse pious and well affected persons had prepared twelve Ships,
and six Pinnaces, with a thousand or more Landforces, at their own charge, by
way of Adventure for the service of Ireland, and desired nothing but a
Commission from His Majesty to enable them thereunto, that Commission, after
twice sending to York for the same, and the Ships lying ready to set Sail for
three weeks together, at the charge of near three hundred pound a day, was
likewise denied; and those Adventurers (rather then to lose their Expedition)
were constrained to go by virtue of an Ordinance of both houses of Parliament.

That although the Lords Justices of Ireland have three months since earnestly
desired to have two Pieces of Battery sent over, as very necessary for that
service, yet such commands are given to the Ofcers of the Tower, that none of
His Majesty's Ordnance must be sent to save His Majesty's Kingdom.

That although whilst the Earl of Leicester stayed here in the Service of the
Parliament, and in providing for his long-expected Voyage into Ireland, a
Message was sent to the Parliament from His Majesty to hasten him away, and
Letters were written to the said Earl from His Majesty, that he should make no
stay at York for his dispatch, but that his Instructions should be ready for
him against he came: And although it is notoriously known, That the Affairs of
Ireland do exceedingly suffer by wanting the personal assistance of a
Commander in chief, to give both life and motion to the Army there; yet the
said Earl has been stayed with His Majesty in the North a month and more, and
as yet can get no dispatch.

That notwithstanding the bleeding condition of Ireland, yet diverse Commanders
and Officers in pay, and in actual employment there against the Rebels, have
been called away from that important Service, by the express Command of His
Majesty, as Charles Floyd Engineer and Quartermaster General of the Army in
Ireland, and diverse others.

That Captain Green Comptroller of the Artillery, a man in pay, and principally
employed and trusted here by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, for the providing
and ordering the Train of Artillery which was to be sent to Dublin, and who had
received great Sums of money for that purpose, was commanded from that
employment and trust, to serve His Majesty in this most unnatural War
against His loyal and best-affected people.

That the Parliament having made great provision of clothes for the poor
Soldiers in Ireland for their present succor, and sending six hundred suits,
part thereof toward Chester the last week, the man that undertook the carriage
of them, one William Whitaker by name, was assaulted by His Majesty's
Cavaliers, then lying about Coventry, who took away these six hundred suits of
clothes, and the Wagon and horses of the poor man, although they were told
that the six hundred suits of clothes were for the Soldiers in Ireland; and
notwithstanding the poor Catryer was five times with the Earl^ of Northampton,
to beg a Release of his Wagon.

That three hundred suits of clothes, with a Chirurgions Chest of Medicaments,
being likewise sent for Ireland by one Richard Owesi^^ds, who was employed by
the Parliament to carry them to Chester, a troop of His Majesty's Cavaliers,
under command of one Captain Middleton, ^^me^ with them upon the Road, and took
away the clothes, and Chirurgions Chest, together with the poor Carryers horses
and Wagon, for His Majesty's pretended service here.

That a great number of draught horses prepared by the Parliament for the
Artillery and Baggage of the Irish Army, were sent to Chester for that purpose;
and being there, attending a Passage, are now required by His Majesty, for His
said present service in England.

That His Majesty's Forces are so Quartered in and about the common Roads to
Ireland, that neither Money, Clothes, Victuals, or other Provision, can pass
thither by Land with any safety.

That Captain Ketleby the Admiral, and Sir Henry Stradling the Vice Admiral
of the Ships which were directly to lie upon the Coast of Ireland to annoy the
Rebels, and to prevent the bringing to them Ammunition and relief from
Foreign Parts, are both called away from that employment by His Majesty's
command, and by reason of their departure from the coast of Munster, to which
they were designed, the Rebels there have received Powder, Ammunition, and
other relief from foreign parts; by which, and many other particulars too long
to relate, it may seem, as if those Barbarous Irish-Rebells are kept on foot
and countenanced there, of design to assist the Northern Cavaliers, and
according to the Earl of Straffords unheard of advice, to have an Army in
Ireland with which His Majesty may reduce this Kingdom, especially considering
those confident Rebels have presumed, very lately, to send a Petition to His
Majesty, intituling themselves His Majesty's Catholic Subjects of Ireland, and
complaining of the Puritan. Parliament of England, and desiring, that since
His Majesty comes not thither according to their expectation, that they may
come into England to His Majesty; Which Petition we may justly fear, is but a
Prologue to that Tragedy they have designed to act here, in case their coming
over be not prevented by the care and vigilance of the Parliament and good
people of England. But lest the House of Commons might seem to excuse the
making of this Order by a way of Recrimination, They, for satisfaction to the
world, do protest before Almighty God (the searcher of all hearts) That they
have as great compassion and sorrow for the present sufferings of their
distressed brethren in Ireland, as if themselves were in their case (into which
they are confident those horrid Traitors, those Monsters of men about His
Majesty do labor to bring this Kingdom) That they have, and shall ever really
endeavor by all means possible (with a due regard to the present estate of
this Kingdom) to supply and support them in this their great affliction,
notwithstanding the malice and obstructions of all opposers.

That the House of Commons lively apprehending the imminent danger of this
Kingdom, and finding that whilst they were active here to subdue the Rebels of
Ireland, there were Papists, Traitors and Delinquents more active in the North,
to conquer and destroy the Parliament and good people of England, Thought it
necessary to provide for the safety of both, by preparing a competent Army for
the defense of King and Kingdom. And although multitudes of well-affected
persons had cheerfully brought in great store of Plate for that purpose, yet in
regard the Plate could not be coined with such expedition as the Importance of
the service did require, and well knowing that One hundred thousand pounds
might for a short time be borrowed out of the Adventurers Money for Ireland,
without any prejudice to the Affairs of that Kingdom, whose subsistence depends
upon the welfare of this, and resolving to make a real and speedy re-payment
of what Money should be so borrowed, did make this Order; which, that it may
appear to all the world to be neither mischievous, illegal nor unjust (as His
Majesty by the instigation of those malignant whisperers is pleased to term
it) the House of Commons thought fit to recite it in haec verba; and in stead
of retracting the Order, to re-p^y the Money with all possible speed.

The 30 of July, 1642
IT is this day Ordered by the Commons House of Parliament, That the Treasurers
appointed to receive the Moneys come in upon the Subscriptions for Ireland, do
forthwith furnish by way of Loan, unto the Committee of the Lords and Commons,
for the defense of the Kingdom, the sum of one hundred thousand pounds, for the
supply of the public necessity, for the defense of the King, Parliament, and
Kingdom, upon the public Faith, to be re-paid duly and carefully within so
short a time, that it shall not be diverted from the purpose for which it was
intended, or any way frustrate the Acts already made in the behalf of that
Adventure.

BY which Order, and that which has been here truly set down, it will easily
appear to all the indifferent people of His Majesty's three Kingdoms, whether
the King and His Cavaliers, or the King and His Parliament do most effect and
endeavor the settling of true Religion, and a firm and constant peace within
that bleeding and distressed Kingdom.

FINIS.
