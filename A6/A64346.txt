A Tender VISITATION OF Heavenly Love, Streaming from the Fountain of Endless
Life. UNTO The tribulated Flock of Christ (whom the World in Derission calls
Quakers) Being several Epistles, given forth, by the one Spirit of Truth,

And the Leaves of the Tree, were for the Healing of the Nations,

Rev. 22.4. Printed in the Year, 1664.

DEar Friends, whom I dearly love, and not I only, but the Lord also, you are
beloved of the Lord, though you be hated of the world, and though you be
attended with many Temptations and Trials within and without, the Lord does
support your spirits, and reaches forth of his virtue and power unto you,
both to enable and refresh you, to bear you above the spirit of the world, that
it may neither within nor without prevail against you, or overcome you, for
it is by the power of the Lord that you stand and are upheld, and he has
owned you, and joined himself spiritually with you, who is pleased to help
you upon every occasion, and take part with you, to manifest his power,
virtue, and vvisdome unto you, power to sustain, support, ease, help, and
deliver you, wisdom to teach and instruct you, virtue to refresh and comfort
you, that you may be acquainted with him, depend upon him, and give glory unto
him; and since he has manifested his love unto you, and shed it abroad within
you, have you not both been dejected and comforted? dejected by the buffetings
of Satan, and comforted by the Revivings, Refreshings, Encouragements, and
pourings forth of the Love, Virtue, and Spirit of God in and amongst you; if
the Lord have either vvithheld or hid himself from you for a trial of you, has
not many strange thoughts and questions risen and abounded within you? has
not Satan struck greatly at you, and sorely buffetted you? and has not much
inward weakness, faintness, and deadness attended you? and was not all
called into question that ever had been manifested from God, and make known
unto you? But after you had been tried under such an exercise, the Lord was
pleased to appear again, and manifest himself unto you again, and then all
strange thoughts and questionings fled from you, deadness and faintness was
removed, and carried away from you, and the appearance and pourings forth of
God in you did enliven, ease, comfort, open, and fill you, so that sorrovv and
sighing fled away, and the joys of heaven were manifested in you, and reached
unto you; then was you filled with praises, and could ascend over all sorrows
and troubles in pure thanksgivings, and give glory to the God of your mercies
and manifold deliverances.

Oh! my dear friends, you have had many troubles, and also many deliverances,
so that you have not been killed, and overwhelmed with sorrows, and Satan's
buffettings, though you have been sore struck at without as well as within, but
are yet kept alive in the principle and spirit of God, therein to appear for
him, and give glory unto him; that principle of Truth and Righteousness which
God has manifested and given unto you, has met with many oppositions within
you; and since you received the same, and were possessors thereof, you have
been opposed for its sake, and because Satan could not kill that good thing
within you (that God has manifested and given unto you) he has struck sorely
at you, for it he could but either by his flatteries or threatenings,
dispossess you of that principle and spirit which God has possessed you
withal, to keep your hearts, souls, and Consciences close to the Lord, and for
his service, and prays in his own way of appointment, then would persecutions
and banishments be at an end, for the cause of God, as aforesaid, but because
you cannot be banished and driven by the spirit of the world from the principle
and spirit of God, and his ways and worship, into the spirit of God, and his
ways and worship, into the spirit and way of the world, and the worship
thereof, you are threatened with banishment from your Native Country and
outward Relations; But as you abide true and faithful to the Lord, they cannot
banish, or drive you from the presence of the Lord, for the earth is the Lords,
and the fullness thereof, and if the Lord suffer them to banish any of you, it
will be for good; you are his, and he is yours; he has owned you for his
people, and signified unto you that he is your God; you have had many
testimonies of his love, and refreshings from his own presence, to engage your
hearts to him, and to carry you forth after, to do or to suffer for him: he was
with his people Israel when they went over the sea, and in the wilderness
also, and did both preserve them and prepare a table for them, and he knows
what is best for his people, and which way to bring most glory to his name, and
comfort to them; and therefore it is good to be with the Lord, wherever he
would have us to be, and to commit our cause to him, whose care is over us, and
whose love is so greatly manifested unto us. So to the Lord I commit and
commend you, with my self and the whole flock and family of God, to be kept by
his power, as a people in Covenant with him, to be ordered and disposed of by
him, as he sees good. And my dear love extends it self unto you in a pure
remembrance, from that spirit and power which has begot us unto it self, and
bound us up in it, and thereby one in another to live and walk together in the
footsteps of the flock, and to lie down on that hill of rest, where the flock
meets at noon day; and the blessing of him that dwelt in the bush, when the
bush was on fire and was not burnt, be with you all. Farewell.

South Leverton in Nottinghamshire, this sixth day of the ninth Month 1664.
Yours, as you are the Lords, Richard Farnesworth.
Let this be coppied fair over, and sent abroad amongst Friends, to be read in
the fear and wisdom of God, in London, Bristoll, Hartford, Kingston,
Glocestershire, Worcestershire, Warwickshire, and in them parts.



DEar friends and brethren, called of, and gathered in the name of the Lord
Jesus Christ, which is the word, the light, and the life, whereby we and all
men were Enlightened, that we might see our deformity, and be made sensible what
glory, dignity, and felicity we lost, by degenerating from the law of the life
of the Creator, and not only so, but in the same light; God has given us again
the knowledge of his glory, virtue, and power, that by the operation thereof
through faith, we might be reformed, or created anew, regenerated, restored,
and established in the image and glory of God, wherein man was formed at first
by the word of God, which has been the principal thing pressed unto by all the
Prophets, Apostles, and righteous men, which have served God in their
generation, and been witnesses of his good will toward men, who gave his
eternal Son a ransom for all, and to enlighten all, as the spirit of God now
in due time has testified unto us, which is an evident token that God has not
appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation, and through regeneration to
become heirs of a kingdom that cannot be shaken, which stands in
righteousness, peace, and joy in the holy spirit, wherein ye that are
faithful have an access to God, and do enjoy sweet inward communion with him,
whose tabernacle is with us, and whose bounty toward us has been exceeding
great, and his goodness infinite, of which I cannot but declare a little, that
posterity may know there is mercy with him, that he may be feared; for in
long-suffering he bore the infirmities of our youth, and in mercy passed by the
sins of former ignorance; he did also quicken us when we were dead, and opened
our eyes that we might see, and our ears that we might hear: when compassion
moved him to pity us in the day of our wearisome wanderings, he restored us a
path to dwell in, wherein he has guided us by the skilfulnesse of his hands,
and chastised us when we have turned aside, but loving kindness and mercy he
has not taken away from us, but opened his ear unto our cry; when we were
little he carried us in his arms, and in our travels and triale he has
supported us, when temptations have overtaken us, and the enemy compassed us
about on every side he has pitied our weakness, and stretched out his hand to
deliver us by his power, we have been plucked out of the mire and clay, and our
feet set upon a rock, out of which clean water has flowed, both to wash and
refresh us. Therefore I will praise the Lord with my whole heart, and ascribe
glory and honor unto the most high, for his work is perfect, and his love
immeasurable to his children, he has given people for our life, and will not
spare Nations for our ransom; they which have dug a pit, have fallen
therein, and they which do lay snares for the innocent shall be taken therein,
as our eyes have seen, and our fathers have told us, wherefore let us hope in
the Lord as long as we live, for though he does now, and has often suffered us
to be distressed, yet have we not been, nor are forsaken, and though we have
been sometimes cast down, yet have we not been destroyed, because under us have
been the everlasting arm of our God, who every way has dealt with us as a
father with his children in whom he delights.

Therefore dear friends, as we have tasted that God is gracious, let us take
heed unto the grace which he has given us, and not decline from the way that
he chose for us in the day of our simplicity, but bow our ears to the
instruction of life, that we may be kept tender toward God out of the
corruptions of this world, and defilements of sin which in ancient time did
grieve Gods good spirit, and provoke him to be wroth with his inheritance;
wherefore let us hold fast the mystery of faith in a pure conscience, and pass
the time of our sojourning here in Gods fear, waiting for the fulfilling of
these very precious promises, which we have received, that we may be partakers
of the divine nature, and thereby do the things contained in the royal Law of
our Lord, so shall we stand justiefid, when the secrets of men shall be
manifest, and judged with his light, and every man feel in himself the reward
of his works, whether they be good or evil; for in them that have done evil
shall the wrath of God burn like devouring fire, but in them that have done
good shall divine joy and consolation arise from the wel-spring of Gods
everlasting love, so these things bearing a weight upon my heart, I judged it
my duty to stir ye up by way of remembrance, for the joy that is set before you
to endure the cross, and despise the shame, committing your selves wholly to
the Lord in well-doing, that he may keep your minds stable in the love of the
truth, till ye come to receive a full reward for every labor of love, and for
all sufferings that ye have undergone for the Lords sake. And dear hearts,
though I am persuaded that diverse of you know these things, and are established
in the present truth, yet whilst we dwell in Tabernacles of clay, and are
subject to be tempted, the love of God constrains me to communicate that which
I have received for your good and preservation, desiring that ye also in the
same love may seek to preserve one another, and admonish, exhort and stir up
that which is good in one another, so much the more as we know the true light
shines, and has manifest the things belonging to our peace, considering that
ye must give an account to God, how you improve your talents; be not
discouraged at the untowardnesse of such as have given way to the enemy, and
are drove aside by his subtilty and violence, for they do most need help that
are the least sensible of it, and do presumptuously kick against the
admonitions and exhortations of faithful friends and brethren, being hardened
in themselves, that they feel not Gods witness, wherein persisting, they are
not only beguiled of their reward, but lose all tenderness to the truth, and
are covered with thick darkness, and drowned in destruction and perdition.
Therefore as soon as ye are sensible that the enemy has got advantage of any
particular, be ready to give and receive warning and exhortation to and from
one another, lest any be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

And dear friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, diligently meet
together, and suffer not your selves to be drawn out from a watchful waiting
state, lest ye slumbering do trifle away your precious time, and grow weak, and
the enemy enter at unawares, for they that wait on God shall renew their
strength, and the watchful eye shall see his Savior and deliverer near to the
refreshing of his soul, which shall be clothed with righteousness, and filled
with the glory and virtue of an immortal life, whilst the soul of the sluggard
is clothed with rags, and such as be careless, entangled with many hurtful
lusts, wherefore dear and tender plants, I say again, be watchful and obedient
to God in things that are clear and manifest, so will hidden things be
revealed, and ye tought to avoid every thing that tends to beget doubts,
disputing or Contension about persons or things which are below that divine
life, whereby you are enlightened, and to wait for the latter rain, where ye
have received the former rain, so shall ye take deep root in a fruitful
ground, and be no more subject to coffiing, whilst your hearts are tender in
the Light, sound Judgment shall shut out deceit and false spirits, and keep
you tender and open to the instruction of life, both in your selves, and in
whomsoever it shall breath forth Exhortation or doctrine, that ye may be
edified or built upon that foundation which is sure, whereby ye may be
strengthened against every appearance of evil, and stand pure in a righteous
holy, blameless life, which may silence all gainesayers, and be to the praise
and glory of God, who has called you out of darkaness, into his mavelous
light, wherein that ye may abide for ever, is the earnest desire of your
brother and Companion in tribulation, who under his own hand has sent you
this Salutation;

from Spalding prison this 19th. day of the 9th. Month 1664. John Whitehead.

This is a Salutation, or a Token of the Lords Love to all the Sufferers, who
are Prisoners in Newgate, and in the other Prisons about London and Hertford,
unto you this is given forth by the flowings of life to you wards.
MOst dar and Well-beloved of the Lord, who have chosen the good part, even the
seed that is elected for ever, in which Gods blessings, as the dew from heaven,
you have felt, by which your hearts are deeply engaged unto him, and ye cannot
but follow him whithersoever he is pleased to lead you; and me thinks I hear
the cry of the beloved seed, which says, Thy will be done on earth. Oh ye dear
and choice ones of my Father! I daily remember you, and when my heart is fixed
on my God, and my life drawn by his eternal Spirit to make supplication unto
him, then many a time are ye spread before me, and as Gods innocent host are ye
brought into my mind as a welcome present, for me to draw near my God withal,
then does my soul cry mightily unto Jehovah, saying, Oh Lord God, how are the
precious Sons of Sion, who are comparable unto fine gold, now in this day
esteemed of, and by men as earthen pitchers, the work manship of Potters; how
long, how long, shall it be so, O Lord? Shall the wicked wear out the
righteous, and the upright be always their prey? Shall Sions Daughters for
ever mourn under the oppressive yoke of Babylon? No, no, says my God, I will
but try them as well refined gold, that they may be made bright as the Sun at
noon day, for I will go before them, and my goings are prepared as the morning,
yet will I suffer them to be winnowed, and I Will give the power of darkness
power over them for a time, yet I will set a hedge about them as I did my
servant Job; and this will I suffer to come to pass for the severing the Sheep
from the Goats, the Gold from the Tin; the Possessors from the Professors, and
in this my work I will give the righteous ones hearts greatly to rejoice, and
in their greatest trials to bless my Name, which has and shall for ever be a
strong Tower unto them; and I who am the invisible Jehovah, their mighty and
beloved God, I will never leave them, for my children they shall be, and their
children shall rejoice, and their childrens children shall be exceeding glad
that God is honored in his people, and shall bless, honor, and praise the
Name of the God of their fathers, and shall learn to know that which is a law
to their mothers, and now shall the oppressed for my Name and Truth sake, learn
the language of Canaan, and the lovely melodious songs of Sion, and the voice
of mourning amongst my chosen shall not be heard, nor Lamentation among my
tender plants, for I will water them every moment, and my dew from heaven shall
fall on them, and I will cause them to grow in a Winter season, and I will
build them up, and establish them in my grace, which shall be sufficient for
them in a troublous time, and this will I do for my Name sake, and all that are
tender of my truth, and in that dwells, and puts their trust in me, they shall
never be confounded; for I will give them the heart of a valiant man, and they
shall not be as a fainting woman in the time of her Travel, but with a spirit
of Courage and Valor will I fill them, as a mighty men for the battle, and I
will make them more then Conquerors, and their and my enemies shall see that in
weakness I can ordain strength, and can cause praises to break forth out of
the hearts of the long mourners, even as the breaking forth of the Sea, because
my people have had no helper in the earth, but have said, Thee, O Lord, have we
vvaited for in the faith and patience of Jesus thy Will to know, thy Counsel to
receive; Oh these shall be as Gems and Diadems in my hand, and I will never
leave them nor forsake them says the Lord of Hosts; for I will be a father
unto them, who without me are fatherless, and a fountain open to all the
thirsty ones, and I will lead them by the hand, and uphold them by my power,
and they shall drink of the brook by the way, of the water prepared for Judah
and Jerusalem, by which sin and uncleanness shall be thoroughly vvashed away,
and my spotless Lambs shall be my delight, for I will dwell amongst them, and
as I have raised them up as an heavenly host, so will I lead them to their
Jrurneys end, for the honoring of my Name, and to the comfort of their souls,
and none shall repent in that they followed me, for double into their bosoms
will I return, and of my heavenly riches, will I abundantly give them, in the
sense of which they shall in the demonstration of my spirit, offer the
sacrifice of praises unto me, and their Prison cries I will regard, and though
men cast them out as a loath some thing, yet them will I receive: And when I
heard this, my soul rejoiced and said within me, Worthy, worthy art thou to
Reign, O Lord God and the Lamb for ever. These things I was pressed in my
spirit to declare unto you who are sufferers in the places aforesaid, or
elsewhere, that you may have strong Consolation, that you may be frequent and
fervent in spirit, for he who is the light of life is come, and we look not for
another, who has given us an understanding of him that is true, and has
signified unto us that we are in him that is true, even in him that the Father
has sent, in whom he has pleased all fullness should dwell, and we have
received of his fullness grace for grace. Thus with my love remembered to you
all, I take my leave of you.

From Visiting our Fathers Flock in the South part of the County of Kent, among
whom I have been sweetly refreshed since I left you, and now intend toward the
East part, if God will. Thus much at present from Tenterden, the 21 of the 9ht
Month, 1664. Your Brother in Tribulation, Faith and Patience of Jesus.
Farewell. Thomas Green.

John Whitehead, A suffering Servant of the Lord, unto the sheep of his
pasture, wishes stability in grace, increase of faith, with all spiritual
comforts and blessings needful for your strengthening and preservation in the
path of life, unto the end of the race set before you, that you may obtain that
which your souls long after, and not be beguiled of the recompense of Reward
prepared for you that endure faithful unto the end of Time.
ASI was waiting on God, to fulfill his will, I felt the love of God springing
in me unto all souls, and in spirit beholding their bondage to corruption, as
also in the light plainly seeing the manifold trials that do attend the camp of
the Saints, and the beloved City which they that dwell upon the earth, with the
instruments of cruelty, are compassing about, thinking to wear out the Saints
of the most high, and scatter the power of the holy people, who have been made
instruments to reprove their ungodly deeds; I say, having beheld these things,
and felt Gods yearning bowels to his creatures, and his everlasting love to the
house of Jacob, I have therein labored since I saw you face to face, with good
success, to streng then the plants of Gods vineyard, that they may live and
grow in that ground, where they have felt both the root of life to nourish, and
the dew of heaven to refresh, and received diverse testimonies of Gods power in
delivering, and of his love in preserving them, that thereby they might be
encouraged to hold fast their confidence, and persevere until the
righteousness of God be revealed, to render tribulation to them that trouble
us, and to you that are troubled Rest with us in the day that the Lord Jesus
shall take vengeance in flames of fire, on them that know not God, and are
disobedient to his glorious Gospel, which I have also labored to preach unto
them that dwell upon the earth, testifying, that the common salvation of every
soul is the light which shines in the heart, and shows the corruptions
therein, that have imbondag'd the soul, that the light may give unto it the
knowledge of the glorious God, and lead it into the possession of the treasure
in the earthen vessel, which so many are seeking without, to find. And further,
I have in the light manifested the confusion of Babels builders, and showed the
nakedness of the Whore in her second dress, and reproved the abominations of
the times, whereby Satan felt his kingdom weakened, and has stirred up wrath
against me, and by his instruments has cast me into prison in the Castle of
Lincoln, where I am now shut up for the testimony of Jesus, and because I love
his lambs, and have labored to inform strangers into the right way.

And now, dear friends, what can I do more to stablish and confirm you in the
faith, than patiently to suffer for the Lord and your sakes, until he break
their bonds asunder? Be assured, that I am not straightened in spirit toward you,
neither is the word of God bound, but therein do I breath unto the God of all
power, that your faith may not fail, but be daily increased, and in the virtue
of the word, my soul says unto my heavenly Father, who is the husbandman, and
walks in his Vineyard, Water thy plants every moment, and cause them to grow
in thy virtue, for without instrument thou can perform thy work, therefore
let the light of thy countenance shine upon them, that they may behold thy
presence in their assemblice, in their watchings let them feel thee near to
deliver out of temptation, and in their waiting upon thee let thy visitations
renew their strength, that they may walk together in thy love, and trust
perfectly in thy name: O Lord, pour forth of thy Spirit both on sons and
Daughters, that in the leadings of it they may serve and worship thee, and be a
refreshing and comfort one to another. Let thy glorious power be revealed in
us, and stretch out thy hand for our help, for thou alone do know our
innocence, and have pitied us in our affliction; Therefore we hope in thy
mercy, and commit our selves to thee, for in the day of thy power we were made
willing to stay on thee, and are gathered in thy name for refuge.

And now, O righteous Father, not only we whom thou have recovered out of the
Apostasy, that have received the first fruits of thy Spirit, but the Creation
which thou have made groans to be delivered from the oppression of Violence and
bondage to corruption. Therefore let thy bowels yerne toward thy suffering
seed, and thy mercy reach over all thy works, and in thy righteousness cut
short the days of Jacobs trouble, and restore all things by thy power, that
all thine enemies may dread thy name, and see that thou know how to deliver
them that put their trust in thee, that they also may bow to thy Scepter, and
thy kingdom come over all, for unto thee alone, with thy Word and Spirit,
belongs Glory, Majesty, Worship, Dominion and Reverence, for ever and ever.

Thus having poured out my supplication unto the Lord, who himself loves you,
in discharge of my duty to him, as also to you, (unto whom I owe my whole life)
I do exhort you all to wait upon the Lord in the measure of light which he has
given you, and look not out at things which are seen; lest your faith fail,
neither be discouraged, because you are sensible of your own weakness, for you
are Gods instruments, by whom he will confound the strong and mighty, therefore
be not dismayed at the enemies rage, whether inward or outward, for though he
fifth you as wheat, yet not one corn shall be lost, and though he tread over,
and crush some of your tender plants with his feet, yet shall the life of your
root cause such again to spring up. Therefore let not your hearts be troubled,
nor fear those sufferings or hardships that the enemy sets before you, to cause
you to stumble, or turn aside out of the right way; but look up unto the God of
all mercy, by whom you do enjoy all things that you have both pertaining to
this life, and that which is to come, who has delivered you out of the jaws of
the devourer unto this day, and does not intend your destruction, though he
suffer you to pass through many great tribulations, for the trial of your
faith, and exercise of your patience, that all of you may be fully made
manifest, and such approved as do love God more than all things under the Sun,
and with their hearts do perfectly trust in him, and seek not out any invention
to save themselves, which may grieve his spirit, but delight in his love, to do
his will, and do patiently wait to inherit the promise, in the day of their
distress,, flying unto his name alone for refuge and protection; I say, such
shall never be put to confusion, nor rooted up, but grow and be nourished, as
the Lillies in the valley, and in bringing forth fruit be blessed for ever.

But they that with their hearts depart from the living God, and bow down to an
image invented by man, and trust in the arm of flesh, thinking by a corrupt
compliance with the world, and their own care, wisdom, and prudence, to save
themselves, shall certainly find destruction in their goings. Therefore let
such consider, whether they have an arm like the highest, or can deliver
themselves from the sword in the day of battle, or from death in the time of
plague, or from hunger in the time of famine; or whether they can deliver their
corn from blasting and mildew, or the fruits of the ground from the Palmer worm
and Caterpiller; and who can deliver their cattle from the hail stones, shafts
of lightning, murrain, consuming rot, and other instruments of destruction
which are at Gods appointment? and who can deliver their houses and fields,
their baskets and store from Gods curse, if rebelliously or treacherously they
depart from him? or think thou, O vain man, thereby to make thy offspring
blessed, or lay up treasure for thy children? shall it not be a snare unto
them, until the moth consume it? Wherefore, I say, most blessed is the man
whose help is in the name of the Lord, and that puts his confidence in God, who
casts down, and raises up, kills, and makes alive, as pleases him, on
whom all creatures do wait, and be gives nourishment to every thing that has
life, whether Vegetable or Animal. O then fear not little flock, but cast your
care upon him, and walk before him with a perfect heart, and love him above all
things, in every thing watching that your consciences may be kept void of
offense, and nothing spoken nor acted against the light of the Lord Jesus
Christ, so in him you shall have peace, though in the world you have trouble,
yet shall your latter end be blese sed, and your offspring inherit your
substance.

And dear friends, meet often together in the name of the Lord, as he
requires, notwithstanding the contradiction of Sinners, and the Laws of mortal
men, so shall you feel the pure presence of God in the midst of you, and in the
day of adversity he will be your hiding place, and not leave you destitute of
help in time of affliction, therefore diligently wait on God in all your
meetings, that you all may inherit the promise of the Father, which the world
cannot receive, even the holy Spirit, that in it you may worship God, and
exhort, comfort, and pray for one another, and for your enemies, not quenching
the spirit, and beware of bringing forth any thing, or running into any thing,
but as you are led with the spirit and power of the Lord.

And if any have erred from the truth, let them return, and patiently wait on
God for mercy and forgiveness, who pitties the wanderings of his sheep, and in
dear compassion seeks after that which is loft, though ninety and nine be left
alone in the wilderness. Therefore, as he is merciful, dear children, be ye
merciful, and ready to forgive one another, and your enemies, as God for
Christ's sake has forgiven you; and have perfect peace and love amongst your
selves, and in no wise jarr one with another, lest ye be guilty of weakening
one another, and so drive the halt out of the way, but in all lowliness of
mind, and tenderness of heart, condescend one to another in the truth, that
you may not grieve one another, and judge that eye which is more apt to look at
another weakness than thy own, and that mind which has a delight to spread it
abroad, for it is in transgression of the Royal Law, left thou be judged of
God, and the measure which thou have given to others be measured to thee again.

And you whom the Lord does anoint with the oil of gladness, take heed of
exalting above your fellows, (which is the heads place) and beware of doing any
thing whereby they that are in heaviness with the mother, (which yet travails
to bring forth) and dwell in her house of mourning, may be grieved, for God
accepts them; therefore let your melody unto the Lord, who sees in secret,
be chiefly in heart, and stoop low, that you may mourn with them that mourn,
and if need be, enter into heaviness with them that are in heaviness, so in the
pure love and sympathy one with another, you may edify one another, and be
comforted of God together, growing unto a habitation of his delight, who by his
Spirit has signified how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in
unity.

And dear Lambs, none of you be discouraged because of my bonds, but in a pure
Conscience hold fast the mystery of faith without wavering, for though the
Devil should cast many of Gods servants into prison, yet the victory is sure to
the Lambs followers, who through his precious blood, and the word of their
testimony, shall come through the tribulation of these days, which shall have
an end, when it is manifest, that we as naturally serve God as Job did, and not
for any self end, but are as willing to be stripped of all, and embrace
affliction for his names sake, as to be compassed about with blessings. And in
the mean time, the suffering of Gods lambs, whether imprisonment, spoiling of
their goods, or banishment, are not only for the purifying, and making them
white, but also for a trial, and to leave all without excuse, that make mention
of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, whom he will judge in righteousness,
according to their works, in the day of separation, when the sheep shall stand
on the right hand, and the goats on the left. Then to them on his right hand,
who have been as sheep given up to the slaughter, he will say, Come ye blessed
of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world; for I was naked, and ye clothed me, I was a stranger, and ye took me
in, hungry, and ye fed me, thirsty, and ye gave me drink, sick and in prison,
and ye ministered unto me; for in as much as ye did it to one of those that
believe in me, ye did it unto me. But to them on his left hand, the Lord will
say, Go ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his
Angels; for I was naked, and ye clothed me not, a stranger, and ye took me not
in, hungry, and ye fed me not, thirsty, and ye gave me no drink, sick and in
prison, and ye visited me not. But in as much as their eyes are without, and
they will not see him afflicted in his people, they will say, When saw we thee
naked, or a stranger, or hungry, or thirsty, or sick, or in prison, and did not
minister unto thee? Then shall our Lord and King say, in as much as ye did it
not unto the least of these that believe in me, ye did it not unto me: And the
Righteous shall enter into everlasting life, but the Wicked into everlasting
punishment.

O Then rejoice ye suffering Lambs,
Because the day draws near
Wherein God will break all Satan's bonds,
And eke your innocence clear.
That all the earth may know
You are his pasture sheep,
Whom he does feed in vallyes low,
Where runs life's fountains deep:
That ye therein may washed be
Whiter than Snow in Salmon,
In beauty to exceed the fair Lilly,
When com'd through the great tribulation:
Wherein your faith and patience,
Your zeal, your love, and constancy
To the Lord God omnipotent,
He Will fully prove and try,
Then in the power ye shall stand,
On Sions holy Mountain,
With Psalms in each right hand,
And praises springing from the fountain
Of endless life, in victory triumphant
Wherewith God will you crown
Over the Earth, Whore, and Dragons power so rampant,
To reign in high renown.
Therefore in patience, faith, and hope,
Wait Gods will to fulfill,
And in his love your souls repose
Till valleys rise above the hills.
Then you that with man's Judgment wronged are,
And for pure Conscience sake oppressed,
Amongst the blessed you shall have a share,
And at the Lambs throne in righteousness be redressed.
In sight of all your foes,
Who at their will and pleasure,
By unjust decrees have you exposed
To sufferings without measure.
Who then shall understand, and too late repent
The errors of their life,
Being constrained by righteous punishment,
To see they have caused their own grief,
By kicking' against the pricks
In their own Consciences,
Whilst they devised new tricks
To add affliction to the Innocents:
Who do on God depend,
Their righteous cause to judge,
And cannot seek revenge
On them who life them grudge.

The first Copy of this was writ in the Castle of Lincoln, the 22d. day of the
9th. Month. 1661.

Let it be carefully copied over, and sent to be read in the meetings of
friends, amongst whom I have labored while it was day, having peace (in this
hour of the worlds darkness) in which I rest, with all the Brethren, and
friends that be faithful.



THE END.
