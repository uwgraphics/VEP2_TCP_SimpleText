OXFORD BESIEDGED, Surprised, Taken, and Pitifully Entered, on Monday the
second of June last, 1645. by the Valiant Forces of the London and Westminster
Parliament.
LOndon and Westminster, (though neither of you are my Native or Natural
Mother, yet) I was borne in Gloucester, a City that has stood to it in our
Loyal and obedient Wars against the King, not much inferior for
Parliamentall obedience or Public Faith and Confidence to you, as has been
obstinately manifested. But leaving Gloucester, with her Massy zeal and valor,
I return my loving Remembrance to London, who has been, and is the
inexhaustible Magazine for Men, Money, and Maintenance, for the supportation of
those durable, famous and lasting Wars against the King, (which the
Cavaliering and Malignant Party calls Rebellion) and which we have causes to
call, entitle, nominate, and acknowledge to be the Holy Cause.

And as our Armies have with unexpected success, been Horrible, Terrible,
Dreadful, Fearful, Victorious, and Invincible, and have forraged through
England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Coventry, and Canterbury, yet that
stiffeneck'd Generation and People of Oxford, have (till now) stood out in
Rebellious opposition against us; for that Academy and City, have ever since
these distracted and disturbant times, been the Treasury of Refractory
obstinacy, and the Storehouse of our Mischiefs; whom to suppress and bring
into order and conformity, our Almighty Parliament has sought by all
favorable means, and by most persuasive Exhortations from the Press and
Pulpits, there has been nothing by us neglected, that might reform them. But
finding their obduracy immovable, their inveteracy implacable, and their
reducancy impossible; we (out of a Christian care of the future prosperity of
that Renowned wellspring and Fountain of Learning) much against our pious
Inclinations, were enforced to surround it with our Potent and unresistible
Forces of hostility, twice in two several years.

In two months of May, we have given them two gentle and friendly Visitations
( viz. 1644, and 1645.) and we always used the most submissive way of
Summoning His Majesty and that stubborn City to our obedience. What a fair
warning we gave them the first year, is not unknown, and how fairly we came
of and on, we have cause to remember, for two great Generals and Armies did
only face them, as an Instruction for them to avoid their further desolation
and calamity. But seeing that gentle and mollifying Cataplasmes and Pultisses
would not serve to soften the Corrodency of their Apostumated Inveteracy, we
have now (about the latter end of this last May) in the Whitsun week,
vouchsafed to lance her Malignant maladies, and by incision and occission, to
let out her malevolent and contagious Corruptions.

To which end and purpose, our (potent, powerful, perpetual and pitiful)
Parliament, begirt and swathed that contumatious City with a strong Swaddle
band of War, with four several Armies, which being conjoined into one, with
a Quadrapliciticall Unity, under the conduction of such a Mess (or Murnivall)
of Martial Commanders, that the like (or braver) Heroes, never issued from the
Loins of Mars and Belona, amongst whom the most Excellent, Expert, Exact, and
Exquisite Soldier, Sir Thomasius Fairfax, was Commander in chief, being the
admired Agamemnon of our Host, and the only chosen, picked, or cul^'d man
amongst men most worthy to be a General Generalissimo. Secondly, the
Courageous and Treshault Treshnoble Cromwell, showed himself like a blazing
fiery Commet, full of combustible Valor, and Subitory Expedition. Thirdly,
that Impe of Prowess, the Magazine and Arcenall of Arms and Military
discipline, the never daunted and dreadful Skippon, appeared like the
Magnanimous Achilles, with his most unmatchable multitude of Mirmidons.
Fourthly and lastly, (but neither last or least in worth) was the Illustrious
Bold Brown, in whose Brain, the Art of Arms is Pyled, and in whose Breast,
Honor is Billited, he most Terribly, Fearfully, drew his Trenchant Sword,
wherewith he chopped in sunder the Faggot-Bond of his fury, insomuch that his
flaming Valor (like a burning Bavin) appeared most Refulgently perspicuous to
the besiedged Oxonians. These four Generals (drawn in their particulars)
were Quartered in the Villages that do Verge, Fringe, or Girdle the City,
namely Kennington, South Hinkesey, West Hinkesey, Botley, Witeham, Wolvercot,
Marson, Hedington, Sampford, Ifley, etc. By which means it was so strongly
Blocked up, that the Garrisons Forces and Inhabitants began to look thin upon
the matter, for they were so unprovided, and unprepared to endure a Siedge,
that within five days we brought them to such a hard strait, that Wheat was
mounted to the price of 4s. the Bushel, Butter and Cheese at 6d and 3d the
pound, Milk at a penny the quart, but 9 or ten Eggs a groat, Radishes a half
penny the bunch, a Judge of Beer 2d, Beef and other Flesh so scarce, that
none was to be had amongst them (without credit or ready money.) In this
extremity, we perceived they were unable to hold out long, therefore our
Valiant Commanders, (like the four Winds) assaulted them at their four
several Ports, His Excellency, played the part of Boreas, and Blustred
Impetuously at the North; Brown with his Brave Bold Boys Blew Boystrously
like Auster at the South; Cromwell Acted the part of Eurus with untireable
Snuffing, Puffing, and Huffing at the East; and Skippon (like a second Scipio)
Raged most Tempestilentially (like Zephyrus) on the West. Thus on all sides,
Parts and Ports was Oxford Beleaguerd, without and within every House, Lane,
and Street, was full of Horror, Terror, Trembling like Hills. There you might
behold a Woman quaking like a Custard before an Alderman, and in another place
another shaking like an Oven; there was careless security in sundry and
several shapes and noyses, some half, and some whole drunk, some piping and
whiffing, some Riming and singing, some watching and guarding, (not at all
regarding either us or any thing that we could do to them) as may appear by a
mad fellow that wrote these Verses in a jeering Contempt of us and our Forces.
For Brown, for Skippon, Cromwell, and for Fairfax,
We have a well string'd Instrument at Cairfax,
And that if they do but their Work by halves,
The Parliament would Hang em up like Calves.
Some of them said, that our Armies should not offend the Parliament so far,
as to do their work by halves, or to do half the work they were sent
about; thus continued this hotch potch, mingle mangle galleymawfrey of variable
opinions and humourous expressions, for the space of seven days and nine
nights, with an afternoon or two; Our Cannons with perpetual Battry having
disgorg'd 6789 shot, our Horse, Carbines, and our innumerable Foot environed
them round, with groves, thickets, and woods of Pikes, our Mu^kets, Petronells,
and Pistolls, breathing flames, and spitting death and destruction. Amongst and
amidst these Rough Robustious salutations, and Mortal Monumentall mortuary
greetings, one of our Cannons (being) discharged or fired at Random, from his
Excellencies Quarter at Marson, flew by chance over Saint John's College, and
most strangely wheeled about on the left hand, hard by the Cross and
weathercock on Saint Mary's Steeple; and passing in post have to Christ-Church,
it broke a corner of a window in the great Quadrangle, and from thence it
mounted, and took the great Lantern on the top of the Hall, which never fell
to ground till it dropped into Abington market place; just in the same Pavement
whereon the Idolatrous Cross stood, that was Piously overthrown on the 31 of
May, 1644. (much about the month, day, and time of the year as the aforesaid
shot fell into Christ-Church) by the most Victorious and Vanquished, the
Renowned and Nobly slighted, the Conquered Conqueror, Sir William Waller; the
aforesaid Lantern, being now in the tuition of the Valiant Colonel Brown,
who has it as a Reward of his Noble services, and is determined to keep it
till he dies, and afterward it is to be hanged up (as a Trophey) over his
Tomb, for a Monumentall Remembrance to Posterity, of his Valor and Victories.

But to return to the Siege again; The Reader must understand, that our
Parliament are so happy to have such Generals and Commanders as are in their
Valors, not only invincible, but invisible also. The Canoneers and Gunners had
the Art to discharge many hundreds of their Ordnance, and no fire or Bullet to
be seen, nor Report of any Gun heard. For of all the great numbers of shot
(before specified) there were very few of them came to the knowledge of the
Besieged; insomuch that they were incapable of perceiving any danger they were
in. This Rare hidden Art was first invented by an Italian, whom they called
Doctor Iackaneico, he was an Egyptian witch, (or a cunning man) in the Reign
of Ptolomy Evergetes King of Egypt.

By the Command of Sir Tom (his Excellency I mean) there was an Artificial
Natural Geometrical Bridge, made over the River Charwell, about a mile from
Oxford (North East and by Westward) what good service that Bridge did it is
impertinent, and not much material to speak of; But this is certain, that the
month of May, ending on the 31, which being Saturday, fell out luckily to be
the latter end of the week, the Sunday following proved to be the first day of
June, so that (by consequence) Monday was the next day after; on which Monday
morning, we had the happiness to gain a glorious Victory. On that day, (that
memorable, remarkable, honorable, dainty delicate day) our Forces ascended to
the top (or altitude) of Mount Hedinton (vulgarly called Hedinton Hill) but for
that day, and on that Hill (to which Hill, Pinda, Ossa, Olympus, Parnassus,
Gadds Hill, Shotover, and Shuters Hill, shall hereafter strike sail) our
prosperous Parliamentonyans, enclosed, encompassed, environed, enwrapped,
envelloped (or what the Reader means to term it) the whole Body, or Bodies
of the Malignants, we fought Valiantly, they fell Violently, some dead, some
killed, some slain, some hurt, some wounded, some fled, some ran away, some
escaped, some taken Prisoners, some put into Bondage, some thrust into
Thraldom, and some carried into Captivity, so that in less time then half an
hour, the mutability of fickle fortune was apparent, by a sudden turn of her
four square-Round wheel, for beyond all expectation, when the Enemy was
singing scurvy Songs, and jeering with intolerable abusive Language and
gesture, at the Sacred Persons and Honors of those whom they have formerly
sworn to obey with Allegiance and Loyalty. Then at that Time, even then,
betwixt the hours of two and three in the morning, we fell upon them Pell
mell, Helter skelter, where in a moment 40 or 50 fell, to seek their habitation
in another world, many were sore wounded; and having thus won the Field, we
presently won Oxford, we entered without Resistants at the East, by Saint
Clements, we Conquered Maudlin (or Magdalen College) with a bare Summons, we
marched Triumphantly to Cairfax, (and leaving the Gallowse on our right hand)
we with force or perforce entered and surpised the Castle, we staid in the
Castle three days, in all which time our Generals were so Nobly pitiful,
and our other Commanders, Officers, and Soldiers so mercifully mannerly, that
we neither did the Town any harm, or Plundered the people of anything (except
Victuals) but whatsoever we had was freely given to us, nor did any of us so
much as give the Oxford folk so much as a hard word, nor troubled them to lie
in any of their Beds or foul sheets, or any linen; and was not this a
merciful Victory? All this was done by less then 150 Parliament Soldiers, in
so small or little a time, that it must ever be with Thankfulness remembered,
and it is not to be doubted, but London and Westminster will express their
joyful gratitude, with Bells, Bonefires, and an holy public Thankesgiving.

To conclude, I have an humble desire (on Request) to all Valiant men of our
Parliament Armies, which is, That they will stoutly, stiffely, and desperately
stand and persevere in the Cause, you know that many of us, could never have
gotten such Estates by our Trades, as we have purchased by this Trade of War;
it is not Loyalty and Allegiance, that will prefer a Tinker to the Estate of
a Commander, it is not that beggarly Thing called Honesty, nor that despised
fancy of Learning, will bring a man to Promotion, Conscience is a Toye, it will
never make a Cobbler a Preacher, or a Wood-monger a Sergeant Major General, or
Colonel; we are now Grammar'd in our Noble Actions, and a Peace would put very
many of us back again to our Horne-bookes; a just and lawful Peace would
cause the King to have His Own again, and every man to have his Right; a
Peace would restore the Protestant Religion to it is Pristine Purity; and then
what will become of our Zealous new Directorie, for a Peace will bring in
again, the contemned Book of Common Prayer; and finally a Peace would make
Thousands of us to surrender so much Pillage and Plunder to the Right owners,
that we should be like ( Aesops Crow) poor naked Rogues, when every Bird had
his fether from us; Let our Conquests encourage us, let our hopes spur us
forward, let our surprise of Oxford, fill our Vei^^^ with Valor, and let the
24 Tinkers of Banbury, be our Presidents, who (for joy of our Oxonian Victory)
have newly Braced their Kettle Drums for the Entertainment of the Lord Say
thither, which they will Seal with their Blood^. Let our Preachers Revile, let
our Pamphlet writers Rail, let Mercurius Britannicus Jeere and flourish, let
Booker, Ny^, and Lyly, lie on, let us Fight for wealth, and Run away for
advantage, we have a Parliament to protect us, and there is an end.

POSTCRIPT, or an old said saw of the Malignants.
Wise men Labor, Good men Grieve,
Knaves invent, and Fools believe,
Then help us Lord, and stand unto us,
Or Knaves and Fools will quite undo us.
