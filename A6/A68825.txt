Dr. Farmer has wrongly conjectured about Tiraute the white. This is a fragment
of the romance of "Torrente of Portugal".

The Doctor is probably right in what he says concerning the elegy on Henry the
seventh, which is a singular curiosity.

For why I will the say
Much folk of that country
Comes heder for socoure to me
Both by night and by day
There is a gyaunte of great reno wne
He destroys both cite and town
And all that he may
As books of rome tell
He was gotten with the devil of hell
As his mother slepynge lay
The king said by saint Adryan
I read a another gentylman
Be there and have the degree
I have a daughter that me is dear
Thou shalt wedde her to thy fere
And if it thy will be
Two duchyes in hand
I will give her in land
Cramercy sir said he
With my tongue I have so wrought
To break my day will I naught
Needs me behooves there to be
On gods name the king began said
Ihesu bring the saffe a gain
Lord much of might
Mynstralsy was them a monge
With harp fedyll and song
Delycyous notes on high
When it was time to bed they went
And on the morrow rose Torente.
And took leave of king and knight
And took a ready way

And I were a rich man
Right gladly by my faye
If thou durst for her sake

Sykernes thou make me so
Of thy daughter hende
Ye and after all my ryghtes
By.vii: score of hardy knights
Al they were Torentes friend

Within two days or three
So he met folk him again
Fast coming with carte and wayne
Froward the se
Dear god said torente now
Good folk what eyleth you
That ye thus fast fle
There lies a gyaunte here beside
In all this land broad and wide
No man on live leueth he
Dear god said torente then
Where ever be that fendes den
They answered him anon
In a castle in the sea
Slogus they said hight he
Many a man he has slone
We wot full well where he does ly
Before the cite of hungry
THus the lady dwelled there
Till that she delivered were
Of men children two
Of all points were they gent
Like were they to sir torent
For his love suffered they woe
The king said so mote I the
Thou shall into these
Without words mo
Every kings daughter fet and nere
At the they shall lere
Against right to do
Great ruthe it was tose
When they led that lady fre
Out of her faders land
The queen his mother was ne^re wode
For her daughter that gentle fode
Knights stood weeping
A clothe of sylke took they tho
And departed it byt wene the children two
Therein they were wonde
When they had shypped that gentle thing
Anon the sell in swownynge
At peron on the sonde
When that lady was down fall
Ou tesu christ did she call
To defend her with his hand
Rightful god ye mesende
Some good land on to lend
That my children may crystened be
She said ladies sayre and gent
Great well my lord sir torent
if ever ye him se
The wind arose on the night
Fro the land it blewe that lady bright
Into these so grene
wyndes and weders has her driven
That in a forest she is aryuen
where wild bestys were
These was ebb and went hem fro
And left her and her children two
^ne without any fere
Her one child began to weep
The lady awoke out of her sleep
And said be still my dear
Ihesu christ has sent us land
if there be any christian man at hand
we shall have socoure here
The careful lady then was blythe
To the land she went full swythe
As fast as she might
Till the day began to spryge
Fowls on trees merely gansynge
Delicyous notes on hight
To a hill went that lady fre
where she was ware of acyte
with toures fair and bright
Thereof Iwys she was feign

To his squire bade he their
after his armoure to fare
In the field abode he
they armed him in his wede
He bestrode a noble stead
Torent took the way again
Unto the forest of Maudelayne
In a wylsome way
Berys and apes there found he
and wild bestys great plente
and lions where they lay
In a wode that is tyght
It drew toward the night
By dymmynge of the day
Lysten lords of them came woe
He and his squire departed in two
Careful men then were they
