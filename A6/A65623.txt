WHereas there was an Act made in the 12 th. year of this King, Entitled, An
Act for the Erecting and Establishing a Post Office; Wherein the Postage of
LETTERS for His Majesty's Dominions is expressed; And also a Schedule of Rates
for Foreign Letters: In which Act there is a Proviso in the words following.

Provided always, That all Merchants Accounts, not exceeding one Sheet of
Paper, and all Bills of Exchange, Invoices, (or Bills of Parcels,) and Bills of
Lading, are, and shall hereby be understood to be allowed without Rate in the
Price of the Letters; And likewise the Covers of Letters, (not exceeding the
fourth part of a sheet of Paper,) sent to Ma^sielles, Venice or Leogorn, to be
sent toward Turkey, shall be understood to pass without Rate, or, Payment for
the same.

The said Clause or Proviso (as is humbly conceived,) ought to be applied to
the Body of the ACT, and not restrained, (as the Postmaster does,) to Foreign
Letters only, excluding His Majesty's Subjects, and the Trade of the Three
Kingdoms from the just Right and Claim, or Benefit thereof, by Extorting Rates
for every such Account, Bill of Exchange, Invoice, [or Bill of Parcels, or
Patterns of less bulk or weight,] or Bill of Lading, or Cover of a Letter, as
for a Double Letter; So that in that circumstance, a Letter may go cheaper to
Constantinople, than to Bristol, or Place of that Distance, contrary to the
express Words and Meaning, the literal Sense or Reason of the said Clause: And
for that it cannot be imagined the PARLIAMENT should either so far forget
themselves, or the Country for which they served, or the necessary and
convenient Correspondence, as well as the Trade of His Majesty's Dominions, as
to put them upon worse and harder terms than Foreigners, or Foreign Trade, to
the Prejudice of the Kingdom, taking more than the Law allows by above Twenty
tbousand pounds per annum, whilst the Revenue is said to produce to the Duke of
York yearly above forty thousand pounds more than it was valued at the time it
was granted.

Complaints have been made hereof a long time, and the Postmaster threatened
with Indictments, but the charge or Prosecution was too great for any Private
Person to wrestle with so great a Power; And some who were most concerned,
being allowed to tax their own Letters, to keep them from joining in the
Prosecution, nothing was done therein. A Petition complaining of this Abuse and
Extortion, was Presented in the late long Parliament, and referred to a
Committee, wherein a Noble Lord had the Chair; But they very seldom met to
effect a Redress: And in the late Parliament the Complaint was again revived;
but before any thing could be done, the House was Dissolved.

It is now Humbly Prayed, that this Honorable House will give their Judgment
on that Proviso, to the intent the Correspondence and Trade in General, way
receive its just Benefit and Encouragement; And that the Votes and News-Books
for the Informtation of the Kingdom, may go free, as heretofore, with what else
this Honorable House shall think fit.
