This to be delivered to the COUNSELORS that are sitting in COUNSEL.

AS A Warning from the Lord unto them Before the Terrible day come (that
warning shall be no more) before his wrath be kindled, that there shall be no
quenching of it. If his wrath be kindled but a little, then blessed are all
they that put their trust in him: Then woe unto all them that are out of
Covenant with God.

LONDON, Printed for Thomas Simmons at the Bull and Mouth near Aldersgate, 1659.

UPon the seventh day of the third month 1659. The Word of the Lord came to
me, and it stuck close in me: And again on the eight day of the same month, as
I was waiting upon the Lord with his people, the Word of the Lord came to me,
and it stuck close in me, about the space of two hours, saying, I will
overturn, I will overturn the powers of the earth; and the word of the Lord
came to me, saying, write again once more to them that are sitting in Counsel,
to Judges and Rulers; you rule by the powers of darkness, and your judgment
is of the Prince of this World, your judgment and rule that you are setting
up, will the Lord God speedily throw down; and you will the Lord God confound,
that are about to establish your own laws, whilst you are out of the Law of
God your selves, and are governing, and ^^ing in the earth by the greatness of
your power, you go about to bring all to your Laws (as Nebuchadnezar the King
did) But your Kingdom shall be taken from you, and the Lord will have the
Government of it himself.

All power in Heaven and earth is given unto the Son, into his hands is all
government committed, and him has the Father sealed, to be the everlasting
governor of his people (the Prince of peace) that rules all things in
righteousness, he shall have the everlasting dominion; new Jerusalem is come
down from Heaven, and a King shall reign over the World, and at his coming
shall he overturn all the powers of the earth. Now is Sion appearing in beauty,
in excellency is she shining forth in the beauty of holiness, adorned as a
bride for her husband; The marriage of the Lamb is come, now is he coming in
power and great glory; and now is the Father raising him up to life again, that
was the Lamb slain since the foundation of the World, and is yet slain in the
streets of spiritual Sodom and Egypt, and there is our Lord crucified; But woe
unto you that decree unrighteous decrees, and are yet crucifying the Lord of
glory; the cry of oppression is amongst you, you have laid heavy burdens upon
the righteous, and the Lord God is coming to visit for these things, he will
bring down your glory to the ground, and lay your honor in the dust of the
earth, he is coming to stain the glory of all flesh; the Kingdom of God is now
come and coming, and his will is now doing, and done in the earth as it is in
Heaven, and holy is his Name, and all that are led by his spirit are led into
holiness, for holiness becomes the house of God forever; It is none but the
pure in heart shall see God, without holiness none shall see God; for
righteousness is the Lord, and the Lord leads his people into righteousness,
they that are led by his grace, are led out of ungodliness, and out of the
paths of the wicked, for the wicked walk in darkness, they stumble at noonday;
the foolish man says in his heart, there is no God, but they be corrupted and
become abominable, there is none that does good, no not one; it is the fool
that walks in darkness, he knows not God, for God is light, and in him is
no darkness at all; they that walk in darkness are corrupted, they are become
abominable, there is none that does good, no not one; They that are in
darkness, are working the deeds of darkness, they are bringing forth the
unfruitful works of darkness, but light shines in darkness, and darkness
comprehends it not, for the light has the Lord God given to manifest
darkness, and to lead out of darkness, and to lead out of sin; they that are
led into sin, are led from the light, but the light discovers it and reproves
it in secret; for whatsoever is reproveable, is made manifest by the light, all
that is acted contrary to the light, is condemned by the light, immediately,
and this is the condemnation, that light is come into the World, and men love
darkness rather then light, because their deeds are evil; they that do evil,
comes not to the light, least by the light they should be reproved; there is
no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus, that walk not after the
flesh, but after the spirit, for condemnation has past over them already, they
are complete in Christ and renewed into his image, they are in covenant with
God, they are the Children of God that are born of God; he that is born of God
sins not, neither can do, because his seed remains in him; he that is born
of God overcomes the World, and this is our victory (even our faith) that has
given us victory over the World, and this faith stands in the Son, and this
faith removes mountains; he that has faith but as a grain of mustard seed,
shall say unto the mountains be removed, unto the Sycamore-tree be carried into
the midst of the Sea [it shall be so:] And this is the faith that stands in
the Son [that removes mountains of sin] and the fruitless tree that cumbereth
the ground removed, and carried into the midst of the sea. Read within, and
come to the word of faith [the word that is nigh thee, in thy heart] that the
mountains of sin [within] may be removed; The fruitless tree within that has
brought forth the corrupt fruit, that has long cumbered the ground: Come to
know this fruitless tree to be removed that has brought forth no fruit unto
God, and carried away by the power of the Son of God; so that the pure may be
known from that that is unpure, and that that is clean, may be known from that
that is unclean, and that that is holy, may be known from that that is unholy;
for that that is holy is to abide in the house of God; for he dwells not in
unclean Temples, neither dwells he in Temples made with hands, but his
Temples are his saints, it is written that their bodies are the Temples of the
Holy ghost, and this is the living sacrifice that the Lord God accepts:
Remember that your bodies are made a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto
God; without holiness none shall see God; it is the living that praises the
Lord, the dead cannot; they that are dead in sins and trespasses, they praise
not God, but it is the living that praises him; its the Redeemed of the Lord
that sings the songs of Sion, the songs of holiness; they are redeemed from the
earth, being the first fruits unto God, they are them that follow the Lamb in
the regeneration, and they are regenerated, and these are they that follow the
Lamb through great tribulation, and have washed their garments in the blood of
the Lamb, and they shall sit on his right hand for evermore, and they are saved
by him, that are redeemed from their iniquities, and they are come to the
perfect liberty of the Sons of God, they are led by his spirit, as many as are
led by the spirit of God are the Sons of God; and they are led into all truth,
out of all unrighteousness for the spirit of truth whom the father said, he
would send (the comforter is come) he leads into all truth, he is come to
convince the World of sin, of righteousness and (...), and to bring
everlasting righteousness, and to bring true judgment, and to set up true
judgment again in the earth, that justice and equity may rule, that all false
judges may be overturned by the power of the Son of God, and all the unjust
Rulers that are ruling and governing (by the Prince of this World.)

Your government is from beneath; a heavy cry and oppression is found amongst
you, and the Lord God of Heaven will be avenged on you: Woe from the Lord God
unto you that are found to be oppressors in the day of the Lords wrath, when he
shall come to take an account of your unrighteous actions, and find you guilty
of oppresing the just.

You are laying heavy burdens upon the righteous, and you will the Lord God
plead with; and whether will you fly from the terrible God in the day of
vengeance? it is not the hills nor the mountains can cover you from his wrath
that siteth on the throne; for a day of terrible judgment is coming upon you,
for the sword of the Lord is already drawn to cut down his enemies, and to slay
them before him, that would not that he should reign over them; but he will
reign and bring down his enemies under him, and by his power will he be known
to be King over all Kingdoms of the World; for God is coming to throw down the
kingdoms of darknes^, for Kingdom shall rise against Kingdom, and Nation shall
rise against Nation, and there shall be wars and rumors of wars in the earth;
for Michael our Prince has a Battle to fight with the Dragon, and the Dragon
is to be cast forth [the old Serpent called the Devil] for Michael our Prince
is come to rule in the earth; and the old Serpent called the Devil shall be
cast forth, as he said, the ^rince of this World comes and has naught in me;
but Michael our Prince is come to make war in righteousness against the Prince
of this World, and against the Kingdoms of darkness; and at his coming the
Kingdoms of darkness do war, for he is come, not to bring peace on the earth,
but a sword, and to set at variance Kingdom against Kingdom, that the Kingdom
of God may be set up over all; for the Kingdoms of the World, shall become the
Kingdoms of God and of his Christ, and he shall rule over the Nations of the
earth, and unto him shall all bow and bend, and unto him shall all the Powers
of the earth be made subject (who is the light) for now has the terrible God
appeared, and is appearing, and he is drawn near to Judgment by him that is the
light, for by him shall all be Judged, and if the light do not Justify, then
it will condemn, and this is the condemnation of the world, that light is come,
and the world hates it, reject it, and dispises it: but woe unto you that
despise the counsel of the Lord, O you despisers and wonderers and perish, I
will work a work in your days, that you can in no wise believe, though men
declare it unto you.

How can you Believe, that receive honor one of another, And seek not the
honor of God only, and have not given honor to whom honor belongs? for
God will be honored, and he is jealous of his glory, he has given it to the
Son that in him all may be honorable: But ye have dishonored the Son that are
giving honor one to another: But the Son honors the Father, and you have
dishonored the Son that are giving honor to the Beast: And woe from the Lord
God unto you that seek honor unto your selves (whiles you are out of that
which is honorable) whilst you are out of the Son of God (the light of the
world, and are found persesecutors of him whom the Father sent a Light into the
world, and in Him he is well pleased, this is my well beloved Son in whom I am
well pleased (said God) he it is that the Father sent to do his will in the
earth, as he said, I came not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent
me, and this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should be
sanctified through obedience, that you should obey the Son of God (the light)
and life of men, this is my well beloved Son, here ye him in all things, says
the Father of Lights, for this is the gift of God, and it is perfect; every
good and perfect gift comes from above, from the Father of Lights, with whom
there is no variableness nor shadow of change; But he is the same yesterday,
to day and for ever.

Behold, now is the Lord God, coming, to take vengeance, on the Rebelious, that
Rebels against the light of the Son of God (in themselves) that have often
called them to return from the evil of their ways, and to return from their
unfruitful works of Darkness: But they have not regarded the call of the Lord
by the light of the Son (within them) that have often reproved them in secret
for their unrighteouss actions: But woe from the Lord God unto such that has
quenched the spirit of the Lord, and are striving against him to hinder his
work, by making unrighteous Laws, You draw the Judgments of God upon you; for a
day of swift Destruction is coming upon you; A day of sorrow, anguish, and
great tribulation is hastening speedily upon all such as are yet striveing
against the Lord; woe from the Lord God to such that are found so doing, at the
appearing of the Righteous Judge of heaven; whither will you fly from him in
the day (...) of his fierce wrath, when he shall pour out his Judgments without
mercy upon the Rebellious and upon the stiffnecked, that have hardened their
hearts against the Lord?

Therefore a warning from the Lord God unto you that are sitting in Counsel,
that are setting up your unrighteous laws, made without the Counsel of God:
this is the Word of the Lord God unto you (whiles you are so doing, you shall
never prosper) the Lord God will over-turne by his power the counselors of the
earth thatstrive for Masterdom, to rule and govern the Nations, whiles you your
selves are out of the power of God, and are not led by the spirit of God, to
rule and to govern all things in ^^ighteousness, Justice, and equity.

Woe unto you that dig deep, to hide your counsel from the Lord, the Lord God
will find out your Counsel, he will lay open your secret intents, he is seeing
you in secret, with his all seeing eye, and he will reward you openly, a just
reward, according to your works of Darkness; The Lord God is coming to rip off
all coverings that are not of his Righteous Spirit, for all coverings shall be
to Narrow, for all men's works shall be tried of what sort it is, and the
secrets of all hearts shall be laid open by him that is the light, then shall
the workers of Darkness appear, that has been acting contrary to the light in
their consciences; Then shall they be made to confess that they have been
warned in their life time by the servants of the Lord, whom they have not
believed, neither will they believe if one should rise again from the Dead.

But I say by the power and spirit of the living God, and it is the word of the
Lord God unto you, (that are siting in counsel) and a warning to you; That you
come to Repentance, and meet the Lord speedily, in the way of his Judgments,
(whiles there is a little space for repentance left) before the time come that
Repentance be hid from your eyes, and that you are cut off from the earth.

For the day of vengeance is drawn near to all that are out of the Son of God
(the light and life (...) men: A day of horible tempest shall pass over them, a
Storm of fierce Indignation shall come upon them; Then woe from the Lord God
unto them for evermore, that are found Persecutors of the Son of God, (the
light of the world) for Judgment is begun all ready at the house of God, and it
shall go through all, and end in the destruction of the ungodly.

Given forth by the spirit of the Lord as received into his servant known by
the Name of Dorothy White. In scorn called Quaker.

But the time comes that a day of Quaking shall pass over all that have not
yet known Quaking, the earth shall be terribly shaken, and not the earth only,
but the Heavens also.
THE END.
