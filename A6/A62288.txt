Anagram and Acrostick, On His Sacred Majesty, K. JAMES II. Relating to the
Late Triple CONJUNCTION OF Saturn and Jupiter in Leo, which began in October
1682, and still continues
Anagram,
A JAMES STUART. JAM TUA EST ARS.
Sir, Now is the Time (if You Judge it meet,)
That Whigs and Trimmers Truckle under Feet.
AN ACROSTICK.
JOVE and Saturn in the Chief Regal Sign,
Astonish more than May's Great Twenty Nine:
Mighty was CHARLES, much greater JAMES shall be,
EXCLUSIVE BILLS cannot change Heavens firm Decree
SIR, at Your Feet These Glorious Planets fall,
Striving to Worship God's Great General.
These Messengers (who seldom walk abroad,)
Vouch, and Own You Their Terrestrial GOD:
And so let US; For though We Weep for May,
Rejoice We too, since Great OCTOBER Sway.
-- -- Amongst the rest, give leave for Me,
To pay what is due to Your SUPREMACY.
Being the Humble Address of ROBERT SCAMLER, M.A. etc.

Printed by N.T. at the Entrance into Old Spring-garden near Charing Cross.
1685.
