Englands Doubtful hopes OR, Long looked for may come at last.
Which has been expected God grant that we may,
Once more in England see a joyful day.
To the tune of, The Princes Birth.


If Faith and Truth were joined hand in hand,
and that our people would agree,
To fear that God, that made both Sea and Land,
our King and Parliament would (...)
As one, O then,
Brave English men,
how would your hearts be filled with joys
What ever dap,
(...) pan my cap,
And drink a health to god king Charles,
And to his faithful Lord and Earls,
upon this joyful day.
The gallant London Citizens also,
when are they see this happy time,
Will be at charges this for truth I kno^,
to make the Cunduits run with wine:
Each man would part
Even with his heart,
and bresse hinselfe in rich array,
Much like the spring
When Charles our King,
Returns in peace to fair White Hall
The Bells shall totter great and small,
upon this joyful day.
The country people that have been oppressed
and also ready to despair,
Would all rejoice and each men make (...)
of which the poor should have a share,
And never grutch
Nor yet think much,
Nay, I have heard a many say.
This Land to see
From misery,
And from the Papists deadly hate,
They Would spend three quarters of their (...)
to see this joyful day.
The Maidens that are like their Lords to (...)
would all be jocund at this tide,
And to contribute they will not refuse,
but lay their doubtful though is aside,
And likewise join
For Beer and Wine,
and sing a merry round delay,
To welcome home,
Dick, Jack and Tom,
That have been Actors in this cause,
Return to ^^nish Cupids Laws,
upon this joyful day.
The second part,
to the same tune.


O What an alteration here will be,
when these things are accomplished,
The Miser of his money will be free,
all will be metamorphosed;
The Usurer old,
That makes his gold
his god, will straight without delay,
For very joy,
Seek to destroy
His greedy mind, and cast of care,
And drink healths to our Kings welfare,
upon this joyful day.
All sort of Tradesment would be over joy'd
which now do heavily complain,
For want of trading have not bin employed,
peace would revive their joys again;
O such a change
Would seem most strange,
all Subjects will their King ebey,
Then should we prove
True friends with love,
And not seek one another woe,
London would make a gallant show,
upon this joyful day.
What preparations would all people make
to entertain his Majesty,
And to good government themselves betake,
like Subjects true with constancy;
O this would please,
And yield much ease,
to King and State in every way,
With friends or Foes,
I Will sing old Rose,
And pay what ever is my lot,
All hatred should be quite forgot.
upon this joyful day.
Nay more our late made widows will be glad;
though they have lost their husbands dear,
The parents which of late young sons have had;
will all rejoice of peace to hear;
The peoples grief,
Finding relief,
they will wipe all mournful tears away,
The mother mild.
That lost her child,
In Wars will soon forget the same,
And praise Gods everlasting name,
to see this joyful day.
Though we are round beset with sorrows deep,
and every man oppressed sore,
And peace the whilst that seemed for to sleep,
can when she please our joys restore:
And set to rites,
King Lords and Kinghts,
then would all sorrows pass away,
With Trmpets sound,
Joys would abound,
Our London Lads will play their parts,
The which will break the Papists hearts,
to see this joyful day.
Whilst life does last there is hope, thus I conclude
as yet all is not overrun,
Our Towns and Cities that have bin subdued,
there was no way the saine to shun;
To save the rest,
I think it is best.
from harm, O therefore let us pray,
His Royal Grace,
Might take his place,
In Parliament to make all even,
Then would all Nations under heaven.
take notice of this day.
Finis.
