Every Perfection find; Ephesians. 1.23.

Both Grace and Glory from him flow, Ps* 84.11.

So good is he and kind.
He freely gave his Blood, the Price 1 Pet. 1.18, 19.

Of our Eternal Bliss;
Since no less could atone for Sin, Heb. 9.22, 23.

His Love would give no less.
IN the Wine Press of the Wrath Divine Lam. ^.15.

He was severely crushed;
Humbled himself to die, and laid Phil. 2.8*

His Honor in the Dust.
That at his Table we might sit,
And be replenished there
1 Cor. 11.26.
With these sweet Pledges of his Love,
Till we in Glory share.

Thou art All Lovely too:

Isa. 53.2, 3.
Thy Divine Beauty, veiled with Flesh,
Thy Enemies despise;
Thy mangled Body they disdain,
And from Thee hide their Eyes.

But Thou more Lovely art to me
For all that Thou have born:
John 13.31, 32.
Each Cloud sets off thy Luster more,
Thee all thy Scars adorn.

Thy Garments tinctured with thy Gore,
The best and noblest Dye,

For ever I Will be Thine.
HYMN III. [As the 100 Psalm.]
THat doleful Night, when our dear LORD John 18.1.

Into the Garden did retreat,
To vent his Grief in Groans, and Cries, Luke 22.44

In Tears, and in a bloody Sweat;
That never to be forgotten Night, 1 Cor. 11.23, 24, 25.

When our Redeemer was betrayed;
Before his Sufferings he took Bread,
Gave Thanks, then brake't, and thus he said,
Take, eat, this is my Body broke Mat. 26.26, 27, 28.

For you upon the Cursed Tree:
Perform this Ord'nance as I do,
And when you do it, remember Me.
He took the Cup too, crowned with Wine,
Blessed it, and to's Disciples said,
It Is the New Test'ment in my Blood,
For you, and many others shed.
All you, my Friends, must drink of this,
Your Sins Remission here you see:
Perform this Ord'nance as I do,
And when you do it, remember Me.
Cant. 1.4.
Yes, LORD, we will remember Thee,
And thy Love more than fragrant Wine:
Rev. 5.9, 10.
We'll call to mind thy Death, whereby
Thou art made ours, and we made Thine.
Psalm. 137.5, 6.
Our right Hands first shall lose their Art,
Our Tongues forget to speak or move,
Before we will forget thy Wounds,
Those Everlasting Marks of Love.
1 Cor. 11.26.
We'll thus commemorate thy Cross,
Until thou come on Earth again:
And, LORD, do thou remember us,
Rev. 11.17.
And haste to take thy Power, and reign.
HYMN IV.
Psalm. 24.7.
BEhold the King of Glory sits
Cant. 1.12.
At Table with his Guests:
Welcomes them all with gracious Smiles,
Them all with Dainties feasts.
No common Food he here presents,
John 6.50 -- 58.
No common Drink provides:
For Meat he gives his Flesh; for Wine
Ioh. 19.34
The Spear his Heart divides.
LORD, give us Faith; let not our Thoughts
1 Cor. 11.28, 29.
Be limited by Sense:
Thee in thy Myst'ries let us discern,
And draw new Joys from thence.
Let Us know thy broken Body was Isa. 53.5, 6

An Offering for our Guilt;
Let Us know, to wash us from our Sins
Thy Heart's pure Blood was spilt.
So shall our Minds and Voices join 1 Cor. 14.15.

In Sacred Harmony,
To celebrate thy Praise, and sing
Hallelujah to Thee.
HYMN V.
TO us our God commends his Love, Romans 5.8.

When guilty and undone;
In that, to save us from our Sins,
He did not spare his Son, Romans 8.32.

His Only Son, Prove. 8.22 -- 30.
on whom he placed
All his Delight and Love,
Before he formed the Earth below,
Or spread the Heavens above;
The Eternal Darling of his Soul, John 3.16, 17.

Him he sent from on high
To clothe himself with mortal Rags,
And lay his Glory by;
To bear the Curses we deserved, Gal. 3.13, 14.

Our heavy Cross sustain;
To bleed and die upon it too,
That we might Life obtain:
Col. 3.3, 4.
This Life is hid in God with Christ,
Who fell a Sacrifice,
Heb. 2.14.
By Death to conquer Death for us,
Phil. 3.21.
That we like him might rise:
Acts 2.24.
For he soon triumphed over the Grave,
Acts 1.9. ver. 11.
And went to Heaven again;
There intercedes, and thence will come
Rev. 20.4.
Among his Saints to reign.
Heb. 10.37
His Word says he will surely come,
Romans 8.19 -- 22
Saints for his Coming pray,
The whole Creation for it groans,
Rev. 22.20.
Even so, LORD, come away.
HYMN VI. [As the 100 Psalm.]
Ioh. 14.18
DEscend, O King of Saints, descend;
Ps. 51.12.
By thy good Spirit's vital Heat
Fresh Joys to every Soul extend,
That at thy Table finds a Seat.
O Prince of Peace, bless thou this Board
Mat. 18.10.
With those sweet Smiles which Angelschear;
Speak Peace unto us; tell us, LORD,
Luke 7.47, 48.
We Are pardoned, and are welcome here.
As Thou our hungry Souls have fed,
Mat. 5.6.
Our thirsty Souls sustained with Wine;
John 6.55, 56.
Nourish us with this heavenly Bread,
And with this Sacred Blood of thine.
Teach us to wash our Garments clean Rev. 7.14.

In the pure Fountain of thy Blood; Zech. 13.1

LORD, whiten them from every Stain
IN the Streams of that All-cleansing Flood.
Each Sin of ours has been a Thorn, Isa. 53.4, 5, 6.

A cruel Nail, a Whip, a Spear;
By t^ese thy sacred Flesh was torn,
These did thy Soul with Horror tear.
Yet every Wound of thine does yield Luke 10.34

A Balsam for a contrite Heart,
Which, on the painful Sore distilled,
Heals and allays the torturing Smart.
Amazing Love! It Is Infinite! Ephesians. 3.18, 19.

No Thoughts its endless Depth can sound;
Exceeding Heaven it self for Height, Ps. 108.4.

And for Extent, the World's vast Round.
LORD, to advance thy Praises here, Ps. 51.15.

Increase our Light, enlarge our Love;
And by thy Grace our Souls prepare Rev. 5.9.

For better Songs and Tunes above.
HYMN VII.
YOU who our LORD's great Banquet share,
And welcome Places find Mat. 26.30.

His Table round, his Praises sound
With well-tuned Voice and Mind.
Remember all his Acts of Love,
His Torments every one:
Heb. 1.6.
Whom Angels feared, him Mortals jeered,
Mat. 27.30.
Blasphemed, and spat upon.
Ver. 29.
See 's Head all torn with Thorns, his Face
Cant. 5.10, 16.
(Divinely bright before)
Now marred more than the Sons of Men;
Isa. 52.14.
Reaking with Sweat and Gore.
Ps. 22.16.
See cruel Nails in 's Hands and Feet,
Piercing the tender Veins:
See how each Wound the blushing Ground
With precious Tincture stains.
Ioh. 19.34
See his pierced Side spouting out Blood
And Water through the Wound;
1 Ioh. 1.7.
A Stream wherein we are washed from Sin,
And all our Guilt is drowned.
But, Oh! what Terrors wracked his Soul,
In that last Agony,
Mat. 27.46.
When (e're he died) My God, he cried,
Why have forsaken me!
John 10.10, 11.
Thus died the Blessed Son of God,
That we might ever live
1 Cor. 2.9.
There, where all Bliss our Souls can wish,
Or can contain, He Will give.
Mean while the Myst'ries of his Grace
1 Cor. 11.26
At's Table he displays;
That so great Love our Souls may move,
And Tongues to sing his Praise.

How glorious, and how sweet!
All Greatness, and all Goodness too
IN the Name of JESUS meet.
A Name vile Men shall one day dread, Rev. 6.15, 16, 17.

As now the Devils fear: Iam. 2.19.

A Name the Heavenly Hosts adore, Mat. 8.29.

To pardoned Sinners dear; Rev. 5.11, 12.

Most dear to them by strongest Ties Cant. 1.3.

Of his Redeeming Love,
Which by a thousand Torments tried,
Did always constant prove.
Not Death with all its poisoned Darts
Could balk his Enterprise;
This spotless Lamb resolved to fall Ioh. 10.11

A willing Sacrifice.
Heb. 2.14.
So conquering Sin, and Death, and Hell,
In Glory did arise,

And in bright Triumph did ascend
His Throne above the Skies.

Ah Cruel Sins, how odious now,
And how deformed are they,

Their monstrous Hew survey!
These with black Horror filled his Mind, Mat. 26.38.

Enraged his Wounds with Pain:
These rent his trembling Heart with Grief, Ps. 22.14.

And all his Blood did drain.
Tho these our Crimes all testify Ier. 14.7.

Our crying Guilt aloud; Genesis 18.21.

LORD, do not vail thy shining Face Lam. 3.44.

Within an angry Cloud.
Let thy Love's Rays attract from us Luke ^.38, 47.

A Penitential Dew;
And while our Vileness we lament,
Thy pard'ning Mercy show:
Then tho our Sins have numerous been Ps. 40.12.

Like Sands upon the shore;
Peace like a River floats our Souls, Isa. 48.18.

And Sins are seen no more.
HYMN X. [As the 100 Psalm.]
IN grateful Hymns, ye Saints, Ephesians. 3.18, 18.

A Love, whose Flame inspires the Songs Rev. 5.9.

Of all the Heavenly Host above.
Tho we on Earth cannot sing like them, Psalm. 103.20, 21, 22.

A fervent Mind, 1 Samuel 16.7.
that breathes his Praise
With stammering Lips, He Will not disdain.
Eternal Father, we adore
Isa. 53.10.
Thy Love; for thou did pleasure take
In brui^^ng thy Beloved Son,
For guilty wretched Sinners sake.
1 Cor. 15.56.
And Thee, dear Savior, we adore,
Who did endure the envenomed Sting
Gal. 3.13.
Of Death, and every dreadful Curse
Justice provoked by Sin could bring.
While we behold Thee on thy Cross,
In every Wound thy Love appears,
Ps. 63.3.
Dearer than Life, more strong than Death,

For fallen Adam's Sons;
On him our pressing Sins were laid, Ver. 6.

For them his Blood atones. Heb. 9.14.

Such Torments he endured Psalm. 22.1, 6, 14, 15 --

As none 'ere felt before,
That Joy and Bliss might be secured Isa. 53.3, 4.

To us for evermore.
Hurried from Bar to Bar, Luke 23.7, 11. and 22.63, 64.

With Blows and Scoffs abused,
Reviled by Herod's Men of War; Luke 23.1^

With Pilate's Scourges bruised. Mat. 27.26.

His sweet and Reverend Face
With Spittle was profaned; Mat. 27.29, 30.

That Visage, full of Heavenly Grace,
With his own Blood was stained.
Stretched on the cruel Tree, Mat. 27.46, 50.

He bled, and groaned, and cried;
And in a mortal Agony
Languish'd a while, and died.
Heb. 2.14.
But dying left a Wound
Genesis 3.15.
On the Old Serpent's Head,

He left his Crown, he left his Throne
By his Great Father's side;
Wore Thorns, sustained a heavy Cross,
And on it was crucified.
Gal. 3.13, 14.
His was the Torment, his the Curse;
Tho all the Guilt was ours:
Lev. 14.
To cleanse us, on our Leprous Souls
His Vital Blood he pours.
Behold how every Wound of his
A precious Balm distills, Luke 10.34.

Which heals the Scars that Sin had made,
With Joy the Sinner fills.

Himself does freely give,
An Offering whole, Body and Soul, 1 Pet. 2.24.

To make dead Sinners live. Isa. 53.10.

The Spirit Divine, for this Design,
Lights on him like a Dove: Mat. 3.16.

The Sacred Three in One agree, 1 John 5.7.

In this great Act of Love.
Ps. 85.10.
Justice and Grace here both have place,
With equal Splendour shine;
No Gift could be so full, so free,
So great, and so Divine.
Blessed Savior, why should we deny
Romans 12.1, 2.
To thee, at thy Desire,
An Offering whole, Body and Soul,
As Reason does require?
Since thou for us did bear a Cross*
1 John 4.19.
For us upon it die;
How great should be our Love to Thee!
Rev. 5.12.
Our Praises, O how high!
HYMN XIV. [As the 100 Psalm.]
Romans 6.23.
WHen Sin had brought Death, with a Train
Romans 3.19.
Of Miseries on the guilty World;
And wretched Man was doomed to be
2 Pet. 2.17
Into Eternal Darkness hurled,
Mar. 9.44, 46, 48.
Where the tormenting Worm, that gnaws
The enraged Conscience never expires;
Rev. 20.10, 15.
Where Torturing Brimstone always feeds
The never to be extinguished Fires:
Genesis 3.24.
When Justice waved the flaming Sword
Of Vengeance over the Sinner's Head;
1 Timothy 2.5.
The Son of God steps in, and stays
The Mortal Stroke, and thus he said:
Tho all the Offerings Men can bring Psalm. 40.6.

Cannot for one single Crime atone; Ver. 7.

O God, I come to do thy Will, Heb. 10.4 -- 10.

I Will bear their numerous Sins alone.
The humane Nature I Will assume, Heb. 2.16.

Humane Infirmities I Will wear, Mat. 4.2.

Hunger, and Thirst, and Weariness, Ioh. 4.6, 7.

Sorrows, and Pains I Will freely bear. Heb. 4.15.

Reproaches, tho they will break my Heart, Ps. 69.20.

I am resolved to undergo: Isa. 53.10.

I Will suffer all that is on me laid Psalm. 22.12 -- 18.

By God above, or Men below.
Tho all the Infernal Powers conspire Mat. 4.1.

My Great Design to overthrow; Luke 22.53

Through Showers of fiery Darts from Hell, Ephesians. 6.16.

And through Death's horrid Vale I Will go. Psalm. 23.4*

Thus said, the Father soon replied,
Content: I have a Ransom found; Job 33.24.

Dear Son, to save the ruined World,
Even thee I with Delight shall wound. Isa. 53.10.

Go execute thy brave Resolves,
Thy Sufferings shall rewarded be: Ver. 11, 12.

Many Thou shall redeem, the rest
Shall all at last be judged by Thee. Act. 17.31.

How precious are these Thoughts of thine, Psalm. 139.17, 18.

How glorious, LORD* these Acts of Love!
For these we sing thy Praise below,
For these You Are better praised above. Rev. 5.11, 12.

HYMN XV.
HOw many Miracles of Love,
Col. 1.26, 27.
What Mysteries of Grace
Has the Ever-blessed Jesus shown
To Adam's sinful Race!
That he should humbly condescend
Romans 8.3.
Our mortal Flesh to wear;
Mat. 8.17.
Our Sicknesses, and Sorrows too,
And numerous Sins to bear!
Was It not enough, thou Holy One,
To lay aside thy Crown,
Phil. 2.7.
And, in a Servant's Form, on Earth
To wander up and down?
Ioh. 11.33 and ver. 35.
Was It not enough with Sighs and Tears
Our Miseries to deplore,
Mat. 11.29, 30.
To teach us by thy blameless Life?
But would Thou still do more?
Whence is this unexampled Love
To wretched Human kind?
Ezekiel. 16.5, 6.
What to attract thy Heart could Thou
In loathsome Sinners find,
Isa. 53.4, 5
That, loaded with our Sins and Pains,
Psalm. 23.4.
Thou through Death's Vale would go,
Ps. 16.11.
That we made Innocent and Free,
Mat. 7.14.
The way of Life might know?
Worthy art thou, O Lamb of God, Rev. 5.12.

Among thy Saints to reign,
Who to redeem them by thy Blood,
Wast once an Offering slain.
HYMN XVI.
HOW sweet, how beauteous is the Place, Ps. 84.1, 2*

Where God his Presence grants;
His pious Children sitting round Ps. 128.3.

His Tabl' as Olive-Plants!
To them he cries, My welcome Friends, Cant. 5.1.

Eat of this Feast of mine;
Come, my Beloved, freely drink Prove. 9.5.

Of this my mingled Wine.
LORD, we accept thy bounteous Treat
With Wonder, Joy, and Love:
O may we in thy House have place, Psalm. 27.4.

And never from thence remove.
Here let our Faith still feed on Thee,
The only Food Divine; John 6.50, etc.

To Faith thy Flesh is Meat indeed,
Thy Blood the Noblest Wine:
Thy Blood, that purifying Juice, 1 Ioh. 1.7*

To cleanse the Soul designed;
To heal a Sinner's bleeding Heart, Luke 10.34.

And cheer his drooping Mind.
1 Cor. 13.12.
Here we rejoice to see thy Love
Through Figures, and in part;
But how much greater Joy will it be
1 Ioh. 3.2.
To see thee as thou art!
HYMN XVII. [As the 100 Psalm.]
Mic. 6.6.
WHerewith shall I a sinful Worm
Iehovah's Sanctu'ry draw nigh?
With what Oblations shall I bow
Before the Throne of God most High?
Shall I Burnt-Offerings to him bring,
Ver. 7.
Calves taken from their tender Dams?
Will God be pleased, if I should slay
A thousand and a thousand Rams?
Shall I upon his Altar pour
Rivers of Oil ten thousand times,
Or my Firstborn an Offering make,
To expiate my odious Crimes?
Psalm. 40.6.
No -- God is so incensed by Sin,
Ps. 51.16.
Such Offerings all would be in vain,
Too mean to save the guilty Soul,
And purge it from so foul a Stain.
With broken Heart and fervent Cries,
Heb. 6.18.
Dear JESUS, to thy Cross I fly;
Tho other Refuge fail, on Thee
Heb. 7.25.
My Soul with Safety can rely.
The Blood that issued from thy Wounds,
Becomes both Oil and Wine to ours; Luke 10.34.

No Ease, until thy Hand this Balm
Into the wounded Conscience pours. Job 34.29.

As at thy Table we behold
Thy All-sufficient Sacrifice,
Let Us feel the Virtue of thy Blood, Isa. 53.5.

Which heals, and chears, and purifies. Ioh. 6.54. 1 Ioh. 1.7.

So while our Feet stand in thy Courts,
To Thee, O God, our Life and Joy, Psalm. 43.4.

We'll bring the Sacrifice of Praise, Ps. 116.17

In Praise our Hearts and Tongues employ. Ps. 103.1.

HYMN XVIII.
O LORD, how shall we frame a Song Job 37.19, 20.

To celebrate thy Fame!
Our highest Flights are all too low
To reach thy Loftier Name.
Yet should the Objects of thy Grace
Thy Praises cease to shout,
To censure such Ingratitude, Luke 19.40.

The Stones would soon cry out.
What Is sinful Man, that toward him Ps. 144.3.

Thy tender Heart should move,
To draw him from the Gates of Hell
With charming Bands of Love! Hos. 11.4.

A Love, by many Sorrows tried,
Cant. 8.6, 7.
And many a painful Wound,
Whose Flame could not be quenched by Death,
Could by no Floods be drowned;
No not by all those Streams of Blood,
John 19.2.
Which on thy Cross did meet
Ver. 34.
From thy pierced Heart, and bleeding Head,
Ps. 22.16.
And wounded Hands and Feet.
Ephesians. 3.18.
A Love whose Wonders far transcend
Exodus 25.19, 20.
The reach of Humane View;
Whose Myst'ries the inquiring Crowd
Ephesians. 3.10. 1 Pet. 1.12.
Of Cherubs look into.
O happy Men who taste this Grace,
1 Pet. 2.3.
Which Angels so admire;

But when all Mystic Truths shall be
Placed in a clearer Light;

With a more piercing Sight!

He gave his Body to be broke,
And unto Death to bleed; John 6.53.

That we his Sacred Blood might drink,
And on his Flesh might feed.
A bitter Cup, with Terror filled, Luke 22.42

He drank off for our sake;
That we might of those heavenly Sweets
His Table yields, partake.
As when he suffered, he became
Both Sacrifice and Priest: Heb. 9.26.

So at his Supper he is both Luke 22.19, 20.

The Inviter, and the Feast.
We sup with him, and on him too, Rev. 3.20.

At's Table he presides
As Ruler of the Feast, his share Cant. 1.12.

To every Soul divides.
While he Love's Banner here displays Cant. 2.4.

Over our Triumphant Heads,
Sin dies, and Grace revives, and soon Cant. 1.12.

Its precious Odor spreads.
Nor are our Pleasures bounded here,
For he is gone to prepare

Rev. 2.17.
Be our Eternal Fare.

No, 'twas for Men, who'd guilty been,
Our Savior came to bleed.

Dear LORD, with what Surprise
Do we thy Sufferings trace; Ephesians. 3.18, 19.

And mark thy Wounds, thy Groans, thy Cries,
Thy Sorrows, and Disgrace!
For all this have Thou born Isa. 53.4, 5.

To expiate our Guilt:
Thy Flesh to heal our Sores was torn,
Thy Blood to cleanse us spilt.
Thy Shame deserves Renown, Phil. 2.8 -- 11.

Thy Cross a Princely Throne;
Well thou becom'st a Royal Crown, Heb. 2.9.

Who wor'st a thorny one. Mat. 27.29.

In Glory wilt appear, 2 Thessalonians. 1.7.

But who can tell how much he felt

On that Cursed Tree whereon he died;

The Powers of Darkness all combined,

Their flaming Arrows at him flung,
Heb. 2.18.
To fill with thousand Wounds his Mind.
Men, by whose cruel Hands he bled, Acts. 2.23*

Ungrateful Men, for whom he died, Ver. 39*

As void of Pity as of Dread, Mat. 27.39 -- 43.

Blaspheme him, and his Pains deride.
His very Friends, like timorous Sheep, Mat. 26.31.

Are scattered from their Shepherd now:
His Father's Anger wounds him deep, Ver. 56.

And down to Death all makes him bow. Mat. 27.46.

Seen him bow down his dying Head?
Have heard how rudely he was jeered Mat. 27.39 -- 43.

By them that made him groan and die?
Heard him amidst their cruel Scoff's,
Even rend the Heavens with his Cry, Mat. 27.46.

That doleful Cry, My God, my God, Ver. 50.

O why have thou me now forsook!
Have marked the Anguish of His Words,
The mortal Horror of his Look?
All this is much, yet it is not All,
But Thou no proper Terms can find, Isa. 53.10.

TO express the Torments of his Soul,
The inward Bruises of his Mind.
All this and more than thou, my Soul,

To skreen thee from his Father's Wrath,

We filled a bitter Cup,
Thou made this Noble Treat, that we
Might at thy Table sup.
May Joy, with humble Fear, Psalm. 2.11.

A true Devotion raise
In all who are assembled here,

So freely from thy Heavenly home, Psalm. 40.6, 7, 8.

To make thy Self a Sacrifice
For thy unworthy Enemies*
How full of Wonder is thy Love!

That Thou should kindly choose to move
From thy illustrious Palace, where
The Heavenly Host did Thee revere!
Isa. 6. compared with John 12.37 -- 42.
Where Flaming Seraphs bowed before
Thy Awful Scepter, to adore
Thy Holy Holy Holy Name,
And thy Perfections to proclaim:
That all this Glory Thou should leave,
Heb. 10.20.
A Vail of humane Flesh receive,
Isa. 53.
To live in Grief and Misery,
And after all to bleed and die!
Gal. 3.13.
To die a Death the most accursed,

And of all Deaths the very worst;

Make mention of his Name; Cant. 1.4.

The great Achievements of his Grace

Yet something of 'em you may tell,
And wonder out the rest.
Remember all his mighty Deeds,
And all his Sufferings too, Phil. 2.6, 7, 8.

How he abas'd his Glorious Self,
To bleed and die for you.
Remember all the Shame and Scorn,
The Vinegar and Gall, Ps. 69.21.

The gaping Wounds through which he poured Mat. 27.

His Blood, his Life, and All.
His Virtues, and his Miseries Cant. 5.9, etc.

Both numberless were found;
Sorrows from Earth, from Heaven and Hell, Isa. 53.3.

His innocent Soul surround.
Crucified by the worst of Men, Acts 3.13, 14, 15.

Forsaken by the best;
With the endless Number of our Sins, Mat. 26.56.

Sins endless Weight oppressed. Ps. 40.12.

Thy Blood's a precious Wine,
The Heart of God it chears;
Judge. 9.13
With Heavenly Sweets, and Joys Divine,
Romans 8.33, 34.
It calms our guilty Fears.
A Living Spring thy Side,

Thy pierced Side did impart,
Ps. 22.14.
Through which a vital Juice did slide
Down from thy melting Heart.

None e're shall be exiled;
None by a Serpent's tempting Voice,

Rivers of Pleasure there have place,
And there are none of Tears. and 21.4.

HYMN XXXII. [As the 100 Psalm.]
LET all who love our Savior's Name, Cant. 1.3, 4.

That Name so full of Heavenly Grace,
In Songs of Triumph spread his Fame
Through every Age, and every Place.
He kindly laid aside his Crown, Phil. 2.6, 7, 8,

And Robes of awful Majesty,
And in a Servant's Form came down
To bear a Cross, and on it die.
Heb. 5.7. Luke 22.44
With Tears, and Sweat, and Blood besmeared
Isa. 53.7.
This Holy Lamb was sacrificed;
Mat. 27.40 -- 44.
By the rude Multitude was jeered,
And by profaner Priests despised.
1 Cor. 15.54 -- 57.
But dying thus, he plucked the Sting
From Death; and rising from the Grave,
Job 18.14.
He triumphed over the mighty King
Heb. 2.14.
Of Terrors, as a Captive Slave.
Acts 1.9, 10.
Then to his Heavenly Throne was raised,
From whence he will come again to be
Phil. 2.9, 10, 11.
Throughout the World adored and praised
By every Tongue, and every Knee.
Tho Tears, and Blood, and Spittle, here,
Clouded, profaned, and marred his Face,
Rev. 1.16.
The Midday Sun is not so clear,
Now it is adorned with every Grace.
Rev. 5.9, etc.
The Heavenly Hosts his Beauties praise,
While, clad in glorious Robes of Light,
Mat. 17.2.
He darts innumerable Rays
1 Timothy 6.16.
Around, for mortal Eyes too bright.
Ezekiel. 16.5 -- 15.
Of this his Glory they will partake,
Who once deformed and odious were;
1 Ioh. 1.7.
For that pure Blood he shed, can make
A Leprous Soul all clean and fair.
2 Cor. 5.4.
Their Bodies too he will refine;
Phil. 3.21.
Vile Bodies, under which they groan,
Shall with Immortal Beauty shine,
Rendered all lovely like his Own.
HYMN XXXIII.
WHat wondrous things do we behold 1 Timothy 3.16.

At this Mysterious Board!
What copious Matter for a Song Gal. 3.1.

Of Praises they afford! Mat. 26.30.

Extended on a Cross we see
The Lord whom we adore,
Both giving and receiving Wounds, Col. 2.1^.

Bathed in Triumphant Gore.
No Victor's Robe so rich a Dye Isa. 63.1.

Before did ever stain,
No Champion such a Victory Heb. 2.14, 15.

Before did ever gain.
Glory and Strength his Torments add
To all his mighty Deeds; Heb. 2.10.

His Enemies fly, and fall the more,
The more he groans and bleeds.
Tho the Law's Curse lights on his Head, Gal. 3.13.

While Satan wounds his Heel, Genesis 3.15.

His Body's bruised by Men, his Heart 1 Cor. 15.56.

Death's cruel Sting does feel;
Yet with firm Courage he over all
Bears up his Conquering Head,
Till on their Captive Necks his Feet Col. 2.14, 15.

In solemn Triumph tread.
Isa. 63.3. Heb. 10.12, 13, 14.
This Shock our LORD sustained Alone,
But makes us share the Spoils;
Mat. 27.46.
He felt his Father's dreadful Frowns,
That we might have his Smiles.
Romans 8.15. Isa. 1.6. and 53.5.
To cure our Wounds and putrid Sores
Was pierced in every Limb;
Gal. 3.13. and 4.4, 5.
His Cross, our Tree of Life, became
A Tree of Death to him.
Rev. 1.18.
But tho once Dead, He Is now Alive,
And lives for ever-more;
2 Timothy 3.12.
Then let his Saints who in Him live,
His Sacred Name adore.
HYMN XXXIV. [As the 100 Psalm.]
COME let us all, who here have seen,
1 Pet. 2.3.
And tasted too our Savior's Grace,
From his blessed Table to his Cross,
In Thought, his weary Footsteps trace.
Luke 23.33
Let Us trace Him up to Calvary,
Not flag as once his Followers did;
Mat. 26.56.
Who when they would at his Table supped,
Forsook their suffering Lord, and fled.
John 18.1.
Into the Garden first he goes,
Mat. 26.38.
Where Mortal Fears beset him round;
Sins pressing Weight bows down his Soul,
Mark 14.^5.
And sinks his Body to the Ground.
Here, prostrate as he lay, he groans,
And pours out Prayers with fervent Cries,
Till he sweats Drops of Blood, to mix Luke 22.44

With Floods that issue from his Eyes. Heb. 5.7.

Yet are his Sorrows but begun; Mat. 26.48.

By one Disciple he is betrayed,
Another Him with Oaths denies, Ver. 69, etc

The rest all run, like Sheep afraid. Ver. 31, 56

Falsely accused, he is doomed to die; Ver. 59, 60

Loaded with Blasphemy and Scorn, Ver. 66, 67, 68.

He Is rudely buffeted and bound,
His Sacred Flesh with Scourges torn. Mat. 27.2. Ver. 26.

His Temples wear a Wreath of Thorns,
His Reverend Face is spit upon, Ver. 29.

His weary Shoulders bear a Cross, John 19.17, 18.

And afterward he is nailed thereon.
Between two Thieves he lingering dies, Mat. 27.38.

While thousand Tortures on Him meet;
His Heart's dissolved within, his Blood Psalm. 22.14, 15, 16.

Flows out in Streams from Hands and Feet.
These Streams, joined with that other Flood John 19.34.

That gushed out from his wounded Side,
Do make a Sovereign Bath, wherein Zech. 13.1.

The Leprous Soul is purified.
HYMN XXXV.
Psalm. 65.4.
HAppy are they our LORD has chose
In his blessed Courts to dwell;
His Praises still their Thoughts employ,
Psalm. 29.9.
Their Tongues his Glory tell.
Psalm. 27.4.
There He his Loveliness makes known
To all who love his Name,
Isa. 28.5.
And is to them a glorious Crown,
And beauteous Diadem.
Psalm. 23.5.
With a Celestial Banquet there
His Table's richly spread:
Luke 22.19, 20.
The Wine's the Tincture of his Veins,
His Body is the Bread.
Cant. 5.1.
To this blessed Treat he calls his Friends,
Psalm. 23.5.
And bids 'em seast thereon;
Mat. 22.11, 12.
Pours fragrant Oil upon their Heads,
Gives Robes to every one.
Isa. 57.15.
Nay, every contrite Mind to him
Ps. 51.17.
A Holy Temple proves;
For humble Souls are his Delight,
And He dwells where he loves.
He at the Door of every Heart
Rev. 3.20.
Does his kind Calls renew;
"Open to Me, and you shall sup
"With Me, and I with you.
And will the High and Lofty One Isa. 57.15.

Vouchsafe to dwell with Men?
Ope' then Eternal Doors, and let Psalm. 24.7, etc.

The King of Glory in.
This Entertainment, LORD, of Thine, 1 Pet. 1.18, 19.

So generous and free,
Cost many a Pang, and many a Groan,
And many a Wound to Thee.
Eternal Praise to thy Great Name, Revel. 5.9, etc.

By all the Host of Heaven,
By every Nation, every Tongue,
And every Heart be given.
HYMN XXXVI. [As the 100 Psalm.]
WHAT mighty Conqueror do we see,
Whose Garments are besmeared with Blood, Isa. 63.1.

Whose rich Apparel seems to be
All tinctured in a Crimson Flood?
Like one who has the Winepress trod, Ver. 2.

Whose Clothes the Grape has purpl'd over?
Ah! it is the Blessed Son of God, Isa. 53.5*

All full of Wounds, all stained with Gore.
A Mighty Conqueror indeed,
Who conquers by receiving Blows;
To give Wounds, first Himself does bleed; Heb. 2.14, 15.

And by his Death subdues his Foes.
He treads 'em down, tho all Alone,
Isa. 63.3.
And with their Blood his Vesture's stained,
But first is all bathed in his own,
His own by many a Wound is drained.
Col. 2.15.
His Blood Hell's subtle Powers confounds,
To them a Mortal Liquor proves,
Luke 10.34.
But is a Balm to heal our Wounds,
A Wine to cheer the Souls he loves.
Ioh. 19.34 and 20.25.
The Vessels that contained this Juice,
A Spear and ruder Nails did broach;
And while his Flesh they wound and bruise,
Ps. 69.20.
His Heart was broken with Reproach.
Isa. 53.5.
But bruised, and broke, and mangled thus,
This Sacrifice our Pardon gained;
Mat. 26.26, 27.
And thus prepared, is Food to us,
By which we live, and are sustained.
Ps. 78.24.
Thrice happy they, whose Tents around
Ps. 116.13
Such Heavenly Blessings still are spread!
John 6.31, 32, 33.
Whose Cup is with Salvation crowned,
Their Board with True and Living Bread!
Romans 5.20.
Praise him whose Mercies know no end,
2 Chronicles. 28.9.
But to a vaster Sum arise
Than Sins themselves; for these extend
Ps. 108.4.
To Heaven, but those above the Skies.
HYMN XXXVII. [As the 100 Psalm.]
OThers may tell of famous things
Done by their Heroes and their Kings,
The LORD we serve, them all exceeds Romans 5.7, 8.

For mighty Sufferings, mighty Deeds.
The Torments he has undergone, 1 Pet. 1.12.

The Glorious Vict'ries he has won,
Armies of wondering Angels cause Rev. 5.11, 12.

To fill the Heavens with loud Applause.
Deep in our Breasts let us record 1 Cor. 11.24, 25, 26.

The Story of our Dying LORD:
As we his kind Memorials view, Mat. 26.30.

Our Wonder, and our Songs renew.
From Heaven the Lord of Glory came, Iam. 2.1.

On Earth to bear Reproach and Shame; Isa. 50.6.

The Son of God his Face did cloud John 1.14.

Under a mortal Body's Shroud.
The King of Kings a Crown adorns, Rev. 19.16. Isa. 6.3. compared with John
12.41.

Instead of Gems, all set with Thorns:
He whom the Angels praised and blessed,
Is made the Rabble's Scorn and Jest.
The Meek, the Just, and Holy One Mat. 21.5.

Under the Weight of Sin did groan. Acts 3.14, 15.

The Prince of Life would learn to die,
And be as Low as he was High. Phil. 2.6, 7, 8.

1 Timothy 4.8.
He that distributes Crowns and Thrones,
Rev. 3.21.
Hangs on a Tree, and bleeds, and groans:
Act. 10.39
He on a Cross resigns his Breath,
Rev. 1.18.
Who keeps the Keys of Hell and Death.
'Twas thus, because he would have it so,
Ioh. 10.11
That we his Wondrous Love might know*
Mat. 26.48, 49, 50.
To rescue us, he was betrayed;
To make us free, a Prisoner made.
Ps. 22.15.
TO exalt us, in the Dust did roll;
Isa. 53.4, 5
And broken was, to make us whole:
To give us Pleasure, felt our Pain;
Romans 6.23
And died, that we might Life obtain.
1 Cor. 15.54 -- 57.
Thus Sin, Death, and the Powers of Hell,
Conquered, disarmed, and wounded fell.
Col. 2.15.
He mounted then his Throne above,
Ephesians. 4.8. 2 Cor. 5.20
And conquers Sinners by his Love.
LORD, since our Pardon, and our Bliss,
1 Cor. 6.20
Were bought at such a Price as this;
1 Cor. 7.22, 23.
As Thou art ours, we 're Thine alone;
Thine will we be, and not our own.
