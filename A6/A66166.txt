His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
HAVING lately told you, That it would be Necessary for Me to go into Holland
much about this time, I am very glad to find, that the Success of your
Endeavors to bring this Session to a happy Conclusion has been such, that I am
now at Liberty to do it. And I return you My hearty Thanks for the great
Dispatch you have made, in Finishing the Supplies you have Designed for
Carrying on the War; which it shall be My Care to see Duly and Punctually
Applied to that Service for which you have Given them. And I do likewise think
it proper to Assure you, That I shall not make any Grant of the Forfeited Lands
in England or Ireland, till there be another Opportunity of Settling that
Matter in Parliament, in such Manner as shall be thought most Expedient.

My Lords and Gentlemen;

Then the Speaker, by His Majesty's Command, said, My Lords and Gentlemen, It
is His Majesty's Pleasure, That you Adjourn your selves unto the One and
thirtieth day of March next. And I am further. Commanded by His Majesty to
acquaint you, That it is not His Majesty's Intention that you should then Sit;
but if there shall be Occasion, He will give you timely Notice by His
Proclamation.

Then His Majesty Withdrew, and the Speaker, by Consent of the House, Adjourned
the House to the One and thirtieth day of March next.

FINIS.
