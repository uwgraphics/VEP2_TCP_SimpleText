Imprinted at Collen by Arnold Birckman / In the year of our Lord M.D.LXI.

The first chapter is concerning the head and his parts.
For fallinge of the heir of the head.
MAke lie of the ashes burnt of doves dounge / and wash the head therewyth.
Falling of heir.
But if ye can not get doves dounge / take leaves of oken tree / and seth the
middelmost rippes of them in water / and wash the head often there with / letting
it dry by it self / yt helps very well.

Or else take the ashes burnt of little frogs / make a lie therwyth / wash the
head often therewyth / that hinders the falling of the heir.

But for ye dry skaldes of it / called in Latin Furfur / Porrigo or Pityra /
seth the rotes of Malowes in water / and wash ye head often therewith / and they
shall fall of. Dry skaldes. Scelfferinge of the head.
He yt has a scalfering head / let the same take ye course bra^me or wheat /
and cast sething hot water upon the^ / let the^ stand one day and night: after
yt let it be strayned through a cloth / and put a little vinegre thereto / and
struck it upon the head / and moyste^ it often therwt / yt does drive the
scelfering away.

If one has a head that can not be healed / let him take thick creme /
Incurable sores
and anoynte the head therewith well in the evening and morning three wekes
continually / but let the head be first well and bare shaven / yt the creme may
the better pearse in / wash the head every third day with strong warm lie /
that the head may be chased therwyth: at the last rensch the head with cold
lie / the same draws the heat out of it / after that let it dry / and anoint
it again as before. Of this wise may thou heal and cleanse a head / though
it were hard crusted with corruption.

But if any has had unclean scurfes or scabbes upon the head / and is healed
of the^ / howbeit it pilleth as though it would break up again / let him struck
or anoint it with oil of flax sede or linseed / let him frot the head sore
therewyth: the same makes the skin strong / hard and also clean / that it
break up no more.

For lyse and nittes.
TAke the heads of herb Gitt or Nigella / and burn them to ashes / put
swynes grese thereto / and struck or kemme the heirs therewyth / that dryueth
away lyse and nittes. For lyse and nittes.


Or else bye quicksiluer for a penny / and slake it with fasting spatle / put
thereto half an ounce of swines grese or butter / anoynte therewyth a kamb / and
kembe thy head therewyth / the same drives away and kills all the nittes.
But if it is in summer or harvest / that thou may have the roots of wild
saffron / take the juice of them: where the same is straked / there slays and
drives it away the list / and also lise of the privy members.

Or else take a little piece of the clothe that goldsmythes wash the gylted
vessels with / and struck the place therewyth where they are / and they do fall
of: and this cloth may thou use to twenty men / and it may be kept yearly
and daily / and remains good to use / specially for ouerbrowes and eye liddes
/ wherein the same vermin called the life of priuye members do grow / and may
be used without danger. Life of priuye me^bres.


For the life of the head / take a penny worth of lorel or baye berries / bray
the^ to powder / lie the^ in a linen cloth / seth the same in running water /
and wash the head there with. The Same virtue has also the root of Bearfote
beaten to powder.

Of pain in the head.
Of pain in the head.
THe pain of the head comes sometime of his oune disease / sometime of other
me^bres / as of the stomach: sometime of outward accidents / as of beating /
falling or sunheat: sometime of wounding / sometime of cold: sometime of heat /
sometime of superfluity of blood / sometime ca^ it not be said by what occasion
/ sometime comes ye sickness or diseas by it self / and the same lasts
continually. But most chefely comes it by ye vpbraything of ye stomak into the
head: to heal this / is necessary to know of what complexion the disease is /
yt thou may purge and cle^se it thereafter. If thou will than help him / take heed of what complexion ye disease is. Tokens of headake caused of blood.
If it comes of ye blood / the same is hot and moist / yt shall thou know
thereby / if the pain is most in ye forpart of ye head / and then are those
veins read yt are by the eyes / the face read and hot / ye veins under the
eyes are pale / the veins of the temples beat fearcely / ye vein of the pulls
beats fast and sore / and is great / his urine is read and thick / his
body louse. These are the evident tokens of the blood.

Tokens of headake caused of Cholera.
If the headake comes of Colera / that is / of hot and dry complexion / yt
shall thou know thereby: The nose is hot and aketh for heat / the tongue is
great and dry / he is thyrsty / and can sleep but little: and when he slepeth /
he fights and is unquiet / the vein of his pulse is little and feeble / and
feleth ye grefe most in the right side. The Same needs not to blow his nose /
for nothing issues out of it / by reason of the great heat.

Tokens of headake caused of Flegma.
If the headake comes of flegma / that is / of cold and moist complexion or
nature / the same has greater grefe in the hindermost part of ye head then the
for part / and can sleep better: he is heavy in all his members / he is little
thyrsty / the veins of his pulse are great and feeble.

Tokens of headake caused of Melancoly.
But if ye headake comes of Mela^coly / the^ has he ye most grefe in ye left
side of the head. Galen says: the head is divided into four parts: In the
fore part has blood the dominion / Colera in the right side / Mela^coly in
the left side / and flegma bears rule in the hindermost part.

Headake of blood
If the headake comes of blood / then let him blood in ye head vein called
Cephalica / in ye hand by the thumb / or else in the forhead. Take heed also
lefst his age of youth (whereby he might be to feeble) hinder the: or else ye
time: the same must be kept with dietynge / as I shall teach hereafter.

Headake of Colera.
If the headake comes of Colera / the same must be let blood at the liver vein
/ and give him to eat prunes of Damask / and sour cheries though they be
dried / take oil of roses or violettes / put thereto as much vinegre / anoynte
his head therwyth where it greueth or aketh / dip two he^pe^ clothes therein /
and let him hold the^ in his hand / ye same draws out ye evil heat: but if ye
can not have the oil of roses / take the white of eggs / rose water and
vinegre / and do thus: Set his fete in hot water / and rub his legs well
dounwarde: and if he will not have the^ washed / then let him dip the fete in
cold water / and lay him down to rest / and not sleep by day time / but
beware for heat and wine. Howbeit if he will drink wine / let it be sour /
and well mixed / let him also drink water sodden with barlye / the same does
cool him / and let him take otherwhyles sugar candy into his mouth / to slake
the thyrst / or else again co^fect of cheries or prunes. But he must beware of
salt meats and flesh / without it were of chycken / or else let him eat sour
unripe grapes / or else the juice of them / or sorel. Let him use a little
vinegre in his meat / but no spice nor ought yt chafeth: and take heed he be
lose in ye bellye. If need constrayne the / take Venice soap or alume / make
pills of it / and use it for a suppository. Supposi^
But if ye have ye roots of betes / struck the^ a little with salt / and put
them up into the fundament / or else seth honey till it be black in an earthe^
v^ssel / put a little salt thereto / and make pills of it / and use them
likewise. If ye have not honey / take the iolke of an egg / and as much salt /
seth the same together / and make pillets thereof / the bigness of a haselnut
or filberte / and put that into the body / the same retayneth the sege. If it
is a man / let him beware of women / for they are hurtful for him / also of
mostarde / garleke / onyons / lekes and such like. Superfluity of blood. To
make the nose to bleth.
If the headake comes of superfluity of blood / then make him thus to bleth
at the nose without smarte: Take seeds of red nettels / and braye them to
powder in a mortar / blow a littel of the same powder into his nose with a
quill. But if ye can not get seeds of nettels / put a hole of the herb called
Millesoyl or Yarbe into the nose / and rub ye nose outwardly softly / and
then shall it bleth. But if it be in winter / and can get nether Chyrurgeon to
let blood / nor nettels / nor nettels sede / nor yet no millefoyle / and
would gladly draw the blood from the head / then take two sack bands / and
bind or tie them first about the legs above the knye / and let it so abide
the space of half a Pater noster: then lose it again / and tie it again. Do
this the space of a quarter of an hour: than tie his arms above the elbowe
likewise / thus shall thou draw all the blood from ye head. But ye must handle
this thing warelye / lest ye let the m^nbre to long to be tied / whereby the
membre might be asconnyed or choked.

But if the head burn to sore / take the juice of Porceleyne / and struck the
head and tempels therewyth / or where the most heat is. Heat in the head


If the head does ache so sore / (by reason of a morre or runninge) that he can
not snoffe his nose / than were it good to use confectes made of the
apothecaries / called Nasalia / and put them thereinto / or else Margerim
wrethen together / and put into the nose / for the same draws out all evil
humors. Headake of a mor.
If ye can not have the same another / the^ take a grene rote of betes / as
long as a finger and a half / sharped a little and bruised / put the same into
the nose and let it abide the space of a quarter of an hour / the same draws
out also all evil humors.

But if ye can not have the same another / than take the sede of Cokle / that is
found in the corn / beat it to powder / put the same into the noise / that
draws sore. Or else take a pot / and put rapes into it / and seth them / than
hold thy nose over it / that the vapor or hot breath ascend so into thy head
/ that thou do even sweat with it.

Or take water cresses dried / not in the sun / but in the air / braye the
same to powder in a mortar / or within your hands / syft it through a lynnen
cloth. Howbeit if it would be to long to dry it in the air / then dry it in
an oven / when the bread is drawn / or else in a stoue or hot house.

Headake of Melancoly.
But if one has pain in the head of Melancoly / his disease is come by cold /
and of dry complexion. Dicte the same and give him to eat meats yt are hot
and moist / to chafe his nature and moist his body. If he have no sieges / then
give him the fourth part of an ounce or iij. drames of Diacartha mi / before
day break / and let him walk up and down / until he get a siege. But when
the siege is done / then give him some thing to comfort him or that may
restore his strength / as suppinge or broth of chekins / or young beafe / and
mix sometime a little beaten saffron in his meat. After that may ye give him a
few pigges fete / for the same make his veins tender and moist / and give him
sometime in the morning or day time milk to drink / yt is sodden with eggs:
that strengthens him / and gives nature force. Also ought he to bath
sometime a little in a bath made with Fenel or Heysede / gathered upon a heye
loft / and otes straw: but ye may not bath to long nor to hot. If in bathing
the sweat will not in short space issue / the^ go out: for the^ is not the bath
good for thy / and keep thy self warm after it / lest thou do take cold upon
it / and beware of all meats that may cool and dry the / as mustard / garleke
/ onyons / lekes / also of hard or old chese / Martinmasse beafe / Haringe /
read haringe / Lynge and such like.

Headake of flegma.
But if the headake comes of flegma / namely of cold and superfluous moisture
/ then is it necessary to purge the head with pills Cochie / and pills De
iera. Beware of such things as cool / and bring corrupt moisture / as
fruit / water / flesh / fresh chese / new bread / and all that is of euel
digestion. His temples ought to be anointed with oil of Camomille. But if thou
have not oil of Camomill / then take two eggs shelles full of flowers of
Camomil / grieve or seere / and seth them in wine and water together / and when
it is sodden to the half / then strain it through a cloth / and put thereto
butter / so much as a gouse egg / and then boil the water and wine away:
Bath his fete also in a deep tob / even until the knees / that the hot breath
may thorou warm his body / and he may sweat. Into this water put two
handfulles of flowers of Camomille / and a handful of heysede well sodden. If
he do sweat well / lay him to sleep / and cover him warm: if he could sweat
in the bed / that should do him good / then give him a little grene ginger / and
a little coriander stiped a night long in vinegre and dried again / the same
does chafe his head and stomach / and consumes the euel humors / that rise out
of the stomach into the head / and trouble the brains / that same does it
swage. Give him also in the morninge fasting / if he can bear it / and let him
fast two hours there upon: Take three quarters of an ounce of aqua vite / a penny
weight of beaten saffron / and a penny weyghte of beaten Cinnamon / half an ounce
of Buglossen or Oxetunge water / mix these together / let them stand a day and
night / then shall it be tempered the one with the other. This does warm his
stomach / rises into his head / dries his moist brains / whereof his disease
comes in the head. Let him eat meats of good digestion / and not to much
at ones: Nota.
for so long the stomach is cold and moist can it not digest well / and if he
eat much / thereof waxes it full of slyme and filth / and many diseases grow
of it / as pain in the head / grievous couginges / agues / gripinges in the
belly / worms / pain in ye mother or matrice / and many other: and if the
pain lies in the head / then let him be bathed / specially with these
herbs: Take of Valeriane and Fenell of each a hand full / Ootes straw two
handful / a peck of Ootes / but if thou have no Ootes / take the straw only /
Heysede / of every one iij. handful / put the same into a little sack / and
seth it in a kettel with water / bath therewith / and when he is through warm and
sweateth / then rensch him with louke or blood warm water / and cast a cloth
or twain over him for coolinge / lay him down / cover his body and head
warm / that he may also sweat in the bed: afterward take some of the
coueringe away / let him sleep a little in the bed / and after that give him
a good broth of a pollet or chycken / or else a supping of young beafe or veele
that is not ouerfat / or else the broth of graye peasen / with beaten saffron
the bigness of a pease: but he may nether eat nor drink to much / and then rest
a little. If he can / let him sweat a little after it / and be always still / both
in the bath and also bed / as he is in the heat or sweating / lest he become to
fell. The head washen with lie / wherein are sodden ye flowers of Camomil /
takes away the evil humors of the head and brains yt are gathered there in
with cold: the same does also the water where in flowers of Camomil are sodde^ /
and put upon the head. Headake of stoppinge.
But if ye head did thus ache / by reason of a constipacion or stopping / so yt
ye could not well take breath / the^ bye half an ounce of Cinomon unbeaten / and
eat often a little thereof / or else take a piece of bread / stipe it in wine / and
strowe Cinnamon beaten upon it / eat the same / that takes away the stoppinge
/ minisheth the slyme / of the which the stoppinge is engendered.

This medicin does also minish greatly / and takes away the pain in the
head: Take a pint of wine / warm the same / then take four yolks of eggs /
beat the same in the wine / and moysten his head well therewith: the same
draws out the heat / and alayeth the pain.

But if the head ache were come of cold air or winds / Headake of cold^ air.
the^ wash ye head with water / wherein are sodden ye flowers and herle of
Camomil / after yt struck ye forhead / temples and stomak with ye foresaid oil
or butter / or else stipe soft clothes therein / and lay the^ into the neck / the
same draws out the evil moystnes and cold / and warmeth ye head. Water
distilled of Betony / and a cloth dipped there in / and pressed well out again
/ and then wrapped or tied hard about ye head / restores the head that was
distempered with cold moisture (even yt some fall into frensy) right well to
his former estate. But if thou can not get the water / but can have the
herb / then seth the same in wine / mixed with the third deal water / and use
the same instead of the distilled water.

A wounderfull experience for the headacke.
SEt a dish or platter of tynne upon the bare head filled with water / put an
ounce and an half / or two ounces of molten lead therein / while he has it
upon the head. Or else make a garlande of Veruayne / and wear it day and night
/ that helps wounderfully.

Likewise may thou take two hand full of Veruayn / the same may thou chappe
small / and seth them in a quart of wine / put the^ into a littel sack / and
lay them hot upon the head / twice or iij. times / that heals well.

A slouggish or slepery disease.
A slepery disease.
This disease comes gladly and lightely of cold and much moystnesse /
specially to a good folk / because their natural heat is gone. This disease
is thus known: they have always great heat / whereof the cause is an
impostumacion / yt lies in the head behind / and his urine is pale and thick.
By reason of yt disease and ye trublinge of his head and brains / he lies or
sits / making semblance as though he did sleep / and yet does not: he
wendeth and waltereth / and happily his head and fete do mete together: the same
must be healed of this wise: Bye a little nysing powder / or else take the sede
of ye Nigella that is found in the corn feldes / beat and use them instead
of the nysinge powder / or else use the flowers of mustarde sede / or take
beaten Mergerun gentle / put any of these into his noise often times / and cause
him often to nyse. Rub also the soles of his fete often with warm water /
vinegre and salt / with a woollen cloth / the palm of his hands also / and
keep his belly louse with suppositories of alum / or other / as I have taught
before / and let him be laid in a place where much light is: let also much
communication be had with him / to hinder him of his sleep / and keep him from
slepinge. But if he has great heat / then may he be bathed in a bath / that
the unclean heat and moystnesse may avoid from him / and anoynte his head
with water / wherein are sodden Camomille / Anis and Wormwood. Roses dry or
grene were good also / of each a few / that the water be not to strong: for
the washing and bathing does much good to the head / by reason it does
comfort the same.

To the patient may be given Diapenidion / Diagalanga or Pliris cum musco /
made in the Apothecarye.

But if the urine is read / and the pulse beats sore / then comes the
disease by heat: let him then use cold medicines / as confect of roses or
violettes. Also were it good often to burn the heir of a man before his nose /
and he so to receive the sent thereof.

Galen says: He that has pain in the hindermost part of his head / the same
must be let blood under the chynne / specially on the right side.

A medecin awaking a man sore, and withstandeth sleep greatly.
To drive slype away and to avvak a man.
SEth or boil Rue or Herb grace and vinegre of like quantite in a covered
vessel / and when it is sodden / put a little more vinegre to it / and put ye
Rue into a little cloth / and put it then again into the vessel where ye vinegre
is: and when thou will awake him / then take the cloth / hold it to his nose /
and brows / and to his temples / the same awaketh him contin^ntlye / and
causes to sleep no more. Strong vinegre holden to his nose / so that he
holds in his breath / does likewise: for he awaketh / and specially a fether
dipped in strong vinegre / and thrust into the nose so far that he be
constrained to nyse.

Penyreal dipped in vinegre / and holden to the nose / does likewise.

Two things hinder a man of his sleep / the one is natural / the other
unnatural. ij. Things hinderinge sleep.
The unnatural hindrance of sleep weryeth a man / and coleth him inwardely.

But he that has pain in the head by reason of exhalation or vpbraythinge
out of the stomak into the head / let the same eat ripe quinces after
breakfast / that are well roasted / the same refrain the vpbraythinge into the
head / and drive dounward to the siege.

But if the vpbraythinge come by reason of a cold stomach / then were it good
to eat Coriander ^ede / after breakfast / the which is stiped in vinegre a
day and a night / and dried again / this withstandeth the vpbraytynge of the
stomach.

Or else give him to drink the juice of Wormewoode / so much as conteyne an
eggs shell / with as much wine: this same is good for the evil euaporacion or
risinge up into the head.

They which are inclined to this disease of the head / ought to be little
sturringe / and beware of meats that be of evil digestion / as Martimasse
beef / salt fishes / or moulberries: for they cause euel euaporacions to rise
into the head.

Him also that has headake / and woteth not whereof it is / may thou heal
of this wise: Headake whose cause is not known.
Take a penyworth of pepper / and as much beaten mustard sede that is not
steped / mix these two together / let him take there of in his mouth so great
as a small bean / and remove it with his tongue hither and thither / let him
keep it thus in his mouth a while / and it shall draw the evil humors out of
the head into the mouth. This must be done fasting / and three hours in the
day.

Headake of much nisinge.
IF a man does nyse much / that comes by reason of cold in the head / him
may thou heal of this wise: Headake of much nisinge.
Purge the head with pillule auree / or pillule de hiera picra / after that let
him eat nutmegges / Coria^der and Clares / and let him often smell at Castoreum /
or else put a drop of Oleum benedictum into his nose and ears in the morning /
that chafeth / and let him eat oetmeel gruell / and drink wine or stale bier
or ale / another let him eat meats that be moist of complexion / but dry.

Of apostemation in the head and brains.
THe brains are grieved many ways / sometime of ye stomak / when a man eats
meats / that the stomach can not digest / and lie sliminge and rotting in the
stomach / yelding an vpbraythinge into the head / whereof ye head has ever
pain / and thereof are the brains diseased. Apostematio^ in the head and
brains.


Sometime engenders an apostemacio^ in the brains of some little skins / that
enuiron the brains / the same are called Phrenesis. Phrenesis.
He that has ye same apostemation / can not sleep / and becomes sometime mad.
The Same apostemation comes sometime of Colera / when ye same is inflamed / and
breateth up into the head. It comes also of hot blood / that lies in the
heart / and brarheth up into the brains: he that has the same apostemacion /
has also great drought in the mouth / and the tongue waxes black / and he
becomes read under ye eyes / and specially about ye nose / and such
apostemacio^ have they most / yt are of hot and dry complexion / when they
labor or trauail to much. He yt has this disease / ye first iii. days when
it ouertaketh him / must he let blood in ye Cephalica / that is the vein of
the head / and the same day ought he to let blood in ye forehead / or else set
horselcaches or blood suckers thereto. But if the horselcaches will not suck /
then anoynte the temples with wine / then do they sit to by and by.

Good head ought to be taken to them and well kept / give the^ none other meat /
the^ bread steped in almondes milk. Give the^ almond milk to drink and beware
of meats of hot complexion / let the^ be still and quiet / and beware of
vexynge and anger / or else becomme they lightly frantic and mad.

Beans are not good for feable brains nor lentilles.
Al men yt have feeble brains ought to beware of beans / for they trouble the
brains / and cause heavy dreams / the brains and head sick. The lentilles do
likewise / for they cause evil blood / and stop the bowels and veins / that
they can not sweat / and that in such men as labor not / tender and sick
feeble / they hurt the breast / the lights / the eyes / the skin about the
brains / and all the veins of the body: Contrary to this are speces / which
comfort and fortifye the body / head and brayes.

Of whirling in the head.
VVhyrlinge in the head.
MAny are whom the head whyrleth so sore / yt he thinks the earth turns
vpsyde down / ye same also has pain in ye eye^ / he thinks yt a sort of
flies do fly before his eyes: those may be healed of this wise: They may
drink no strong drinks nor wine / without it be well alayed with water / and
to the^ ought to be given pills made of half an ounce of Aloe / and a
penyweyght of Mastix / give him of them every night five / ye bigness of small
beans / and give him after yt Diamargariton or Dianthos / or else Diapliris /
for the same comfort the head and stomach / and anoynte his head with oil of
Camomille.

Or else take Betony / whose leaves must be dried in the shadow / and made to
powder / the same strowe or struck upon a piece of bread / being stiped ni wine /
and eat the same in the morninge and at even / the same restores the brains.
Or else take Cerfoil or Cheruill sodden in water / and lay it to the temples and
forehead / the same warmeth the brains and head / and take Pennyreal made to
powder / and drink it with water of Pennyreal. Comin refraineth the whyrling /
comfort the brains / and makes them to grow again or increase.

Another for the whyrlinge.
COmmen stiped in vinegre three days long / and after dried again / and at
night when one will go to bed / kept hole in the mouth / and chawed as long as
a man can / at the last swalowed down / etc. Some eat it made to powder / but
it is not so good.

If it were a sickness fervent / by reason of an exceeding cold or whyrling /
then take the brains of a hog / roast the same upon a grede iron / and cut
slices thereof / and strowe a powder there upon made of Cummin Peonye sede and
Penny real in like qua^tite: this is very good / put thereto so much miscelde^
or an oak / as any of ye other spices made to powder also / and give it to ye
patie^t / let him use this iij. or iiij. times after another / and he shall be
healed. For it drives out all superfluous humors of the brains / and dries
and sh^rpeneth it.

When a man can not sleep.
Often times comes that a man can not sleep by reason of the heat of ye brains
moving / sometime by reason of the read colera / waking unnatural.
which is hot and dry / sometime by reason of the black colera / which is
cold and dry / when melancoly is risen into the head / sometime comes it by
reason of exceeding heat / that is risen into the head of sweet moystinesse.

If the waking come of melancolia or sorowfulnesse / then becomes a man
straight about the cheste or stomach / and his heat is dry: waking of
melancolia.

waking of read colera.


ye color also of his skin is altered. But if ye waking come of ye read colera
/ then waxes his skin read colored also / then give him barley water to drink.
But if the waking come of the black colera / then becomes the skin of the
patient pale / and he has much carfulness / anguish and pensisnesse. But if
it comes of phlegma / then becomes the patient heavy and slouggish.

It is to be considered / that if a man watch much / it makes him heavy of
courage / and that comes by reason his members dry / wherein lies the power
of the body / and it hinders also the digestion of the stomach / whereof are
engendered evil moystures in the body. Nota.


If the weaking is caused by colera / then wash his head with water / wherein
are sodden leaves of violettes / or else Lettis / or the sede of it / and struck
the head with women milcke. Cure of the vvakinge of colera.


Alume the bigness of a great bean kept in the mouth / draws the moistness
out of the head: after that wash the mouth with water / and beware of all
things that are hot of complexion.

If the waking be caused by reason of heat / take white or black poppy sede /
braye the same in a mortar / pour water therein / and make a milk of it / which
give him to drink. waking of heat.
Or else seth the tops of black poppye in milk / and let him drink it. Take
a dish of black poppy sede / beat it well / temper it with water blood warm /
that it wax as a thick milk / moysten therein a fine linen cloth a hand
broad / and as long that it may go about his head: the same does cool his
head / and if he awake about mydnighte / do it again. Howbeit ye must take heed / that if he have no sieges / then give him to bedwarde half an ounce of
syrope of Violettes / with an ounce of warm water / mixte together / but let it
be cold when ye will ministre him the same: give him also to drink cream / or
potage of peasen sodden without any salt or fatness / only peasen / and let
him drink the same blood warm in the morning / let him after this lie high
with the head / well covered / and let him fast hereupon six hours.
Nevertheless if he wax faynte / and has had a siege / then may he eat and
drink a little, but beware of excess.

The crounes upon the poppy heads sodden in milk / make of the same a pappe /
and thereof at night: the same may be given a young child / and it causes to
sleep fast and restlye. Or else take Betony / and lay it upon his head.

If one slepeth vnrestly / let him eat lettice: but is it a child / let the
Lettice be well sodden in water / and give him the same to drink.

Of one that has the palsye.
The palsy.
THe palsy takes men sundery wise / for sometime comes the disease by anger /
sometime by cold / sometime by superfluous eatinge and drinkinge / whereof is
engendered in man ouermuche slyme / whereby the veins are stopped / or else that
the blood increases excessiuely / and overcomes the heart / or else strayth
in the members / of the which is caused the palseye. It takes men also that be
lecherous / whose mary in the bones waysteth and cools / so that unawares all
his sorce fails / and he finally does dye.

Sometime does it take any of the members that have been maimed / and not well
healed / whereof they wax sometime sere / and can not suffer the heat of the
heart / which is cause of their death and destruction / and the membre
becomes lame and wrye.

The causes of the palsy.
This disease takes sometime the one membre / as hand or foot / sometime the
half body / or the tongue / so that a man can not speak: sometime comes it of
ouermuche joy / heuinesse / meat or drink / ouermuche labor / rest /
slothfulness / fear / swounynge / hartequake / and of supers^uitye of blood
/ flegma / colera or melancoly.

Sometime is the cause / that the two strings / coming down from the brain
through the backbone into the fete: through the one goes the natural heat /
and through the other the cold / that the same stringes (I say) are stopped /
either the one or both. Wherefore / in whatsoever membre is stopped this stringe
/ that the natural spirit can not come into the same / it waxes lame. Let
every Physicion or Surgeon therefore rule him after this / and well and
exactly know / and search the cause of the disease / that he may the more
certainly know how to heal the patient.

Supers^uitye moisture.
If moisture is cause of the disease / then must the same be minished by such
things as consume it / warm and comfort the body / of this wise: Take
Lauender / Sage / Cousloppe called herba Parali^is / Ren / Juniper berryes / of
each a handful / a pint of Aqua vite / a quarte of strong white wine / putt
all these into a great pot / and set it into a kettel with water / and let
it seth well. With this wine streke the lymmes grieved twyse in the day / and
let them dry again by them selves / and drink twyse in the day of this wine
/ at every time so much as an eggs shell conteyneth.

Supersluity of blood.
But if the disease is comme by reason of supersluitye of blood / then must he
be letten blood incontinentlye. And if the disease is in the right side /
then let him blood in the left side: If it is in the left side / then let
him blood in the right side / in the arm / and give him half a dragme or
triakle in a bath / with warm wine / wherein Castoreum has been sodden. But if
thou haste not Castoreum / then take Lauender or Sage water / drink that / the
same helps. But if thou haste not the water also / sees the herb either of
them in good wine / and drink it. Or else take fine Sage / Lauender / of each
three handful / let them stepe in three pintes of wine xiiij. days / after that
still and drink it. If ye can not stylle it / then seth the wine with the
herbs / and give him to drink of it.

If the palsy has taken a man, and his members were so holy^ taken, that he
does not feale when he is touched upon the same, then let him be bathed dry of
this wise.
Cover a bathing vessel well and close / lay brickestones in the fire / that
they wax glowynge hot. A bathe for the Palsye.
Take also Juniper berries / Mullen called Tapsus barbatus / and read Organ /
of each four hand full / seth the same well in a kettel well covered / or else
in a pot / and put six quartes of good wine thereto / put hot water in the
bathing vessel / that it be well warmed. And before thou entrest into the
vessel / take two tyles that be hoted / put them into a tobbe / and pour of
this foresaid wine upon them / so that even the very bathing vessel be
warmed with it: then set the patient in the vessel / and take always a stone
out and into the tobbe / and pour of the wine upon it / until he do sweat.
But ye must beware lest he do bath to hot / that he faint not / or that he
bath not to long. Of this bath are all his members chafed / and that helps
him very well. When he goes forth out of the bath / then let him lay himself
upon a bed: and if his strength is so good / that he can sweat in the bed /
that is very good for him. Let him also beware for taking cold. And when he
waxes dry / then let his lamed lymmes be straked with water of Lauender. If
ye have not the water / then take the wine wherein Lauender has been sodden
with Sage / or else Sage alone / do this three times in the day. If he has
streingth sufficient / then let him be bathed ix. days long / every day
ones. He ought also to be anointed with half an ounce of Castoreum made to
powder / with ij. ounces of oil of olive warmed / let his limbs be anointed
therewith threse in the day / if he can suffer it.

To restore again members that be lamed or taken.
TAke Sage and seth it in water / put it into a long pott: To restore again
me^bres that be l^med or taken.
if the disease is in the hands / then put always one hand into the pott /
that the exhalacion come to it so hot as ye can suffer it / till it do sweat.
After that take half a pound of Aqua vite / and a hand full of Sage / and as
much Rue / cut them small / and seth them in the Aqua vite / in a pott with a
narrow mouth / well stopped / and so put into seething water.

If the Aqua vite is drunk in of the herbs / than put more therein / and seth
it until it boyleth / then put a little thereof into a gobblet or other crewyse /
well close / and chafe it so warm as ye can suffer it: stype a soft or fine
cloth therein / and struck the patientes lymmes therewyth by a fire. After yt
take ^yle of Camomille / and put thereto as much Aqua vite / and struck the same
with a soft linen cloth about the joints of the paciente. The cloth ought to
be made of this wise / that it be as long / that it may cover the ioynte
holy: then wind a black shepes skin about the ioynture / every even and
morrow / xiiij. days continually.

But if the Palsye has taken a foot / arm or knee / then put the herbs out
into a tob / lay a piece of wood thereupon / set the fete there on / and cover
the tob close. And when it waxes cold / then chafe it again with a hot
brick / and bath the membre / as before. But if the disease were in either of
the houkels or shoulders / then must the foresaid herbs be putt into a little
sack or bag / being broad and long half a yard / and then seth it / and
lay i^ hot upon the taken membre: and when it waxes cold / then to lay
another strayghte way in the place / and anoynte him as before / and keep the
membre that is taken allwaye warm. Let his meat and drink be allwaye
seasoned with beaten saffron / according as he couled. Let him also eat often
young hogs or porckes fete / sodden with rapes: the same comfort the synewes.
Or else let him use instead of saffron / Cinnamon / or else the soueraygne
Buglosse.

For trembling or shakinge of the hands.
Tre^bli^ge or shakinge of hands.
Wash thy hands out of a Lauor with cold water / and let them dry by them
selves / as often as thou do wash them: but it were better if ye laid Sage
there in.

If a man stands in fear of the Palsye / let the same eat every morning
two or three mustard seeds / and two pepper corns. The Same is assured for the
same disease that day.

Of drunkenness.
Dronkenesse.
Drunkenness comes often by superfluous and undigested vapor / braythynge up /
and troubling the brains. Likewise does also the Son / with ouerchafynge head
/ whereof the brains wax feeble / and man's head aketh: which accident dronken
folk does overtake also. Drunkenness does also weaken the wit and body of
man with the memory so sore / that he knows no more what he does / then an
unreasonable beast.

To wax dronken and yet drink not over much.
It chances otherwhyles to some fol^e / to be dronken / and yet do not drink
ouermuche: and that happens two manner of ways: First that they have so
great pain / or wept so much / that thereby their brains and head are become
feeble: and when they drink / the drinkinge does so much the sooner strike into
their brains. Besides this are many men / that by nature have a feeble head and
brains / though they are no great drinks / and therefore does the drink run
sone into their heads. This also happens diverse ways: First / because the
drinks are to strong for them. Secondly / because the wedder or place where
they drink / are to hot for them / or else the Son has febled their
brains. Thyrdelye / if they are in a whote place and much noise / which they
are not accostumed / with that does the drink swetely ouercomme them / etc.

If the drunkenness is of hot complexion / then anoynte his head with oil of
roses / or oil of violettes / or both mixte together / anoynte (I say) his
head and temples there with: Dronkenesse of hot complexion.
after yt give him to drink water of Poppy / beaten with water of roses / and
mixte together like milk. After that set his fete into a warm water / rub
them with salt / with a woollen cloth / and then anoynte them with oil of
violettes / that the vapors may synke down out of the head. After the same
cause him sieges with pills of alume or soap / or else with the yolke of an
egg and salt. Let his drink be barley water / or else syrop of violettes /
with as much again blood warm water to drink. All this have I chefelye
showed therefore / that if a man douteth / he may know how to help him self.

I read / that if a man do eat three carnels of Almondes / he does not lightely
wax dronken. Nota.
He yt knows he is grieved with that impediment / the same ought so much the
more take heed to him self / lest that rudeness and misbehaueour happen to
him: for it makes feeble every mannis body and soul / his understanding /
wit and honesty / etc.

If a man is greatly thyrstinge / and dare not drink his fill / the same shall
slake his thyrste of this wise: To slake thyrste.
Let him take flint stones / the bigness of a Wallnut / and lay them in
cold water / and now and than let him take one of them into his mouth /
that shall make him moist.

For the fallinge evil.
Against the falling evil or syknesse / take miscelden of oken tree with the
bark an ounce miscelden / of Pere tree half an ounce / the paring of the toppet
of hertes horn a quarter of an ounce: Fallinge sickness
make of these things a powder / and give the patient thereof to drink / the
more he drinks thereof / the better it is / and this must he do fasting.

Put also of the powder into a cloth / and lay it under his head without
his knoweledge / and let him sleep there upon.

This powder must he use in the morning fasting / and to bedwarde at even /
and let the powder be refreshed every night. Let also the powder to be
laid under his head / and the powder that he drinks / be of like weighte.
This does help him.

Macer writes that the roots of Peony be very good for the fallinge syknesse
/ if they be hanged about the neck. Lib. 6. simpliciu^
Galene does also write of a child / which had the root of Peonye hanging
about his neck / and was fre all that while of the fallinge sickness / that it
was about it: and when it was fallen of by chance / than gat it his former
disease again.

Hipocrates says also / that he did tie a child of five years the rote of
Peony about the neck / and it rose continentlye again from the fallinge
sycknesse / and was hole: and thus is it twyse proved.

If it be a man yt is grieved with this disease / let the same take a he Wolves
heart / and make it to powder / and let him use that against the disease: but
if it is a woman / let her take a she Wolves heart / etc.

A wounderfull powder for the falling sycnesse.
Powder for the fallinge sickness
TAke a living or quick molle / open him / and take out the entrails / and
cast them away. After that put the Molle with skin and altogether into an
earthen or stone pott / stop the same well and close with clay / set it then
by the fire / and let it stand until the moll is consumed holy to powder.
After that lay the same powder upon a marbel stone / that is clean washed /
and take the juice of Cousloppe leaves or rotes two ounces / and grind the same
with the powder in the Son. The next day grind it again with the juice /
and again the third day / and let it always dry in the Son. After that take
the rotes of Basil / and stamp them / and take an ounce of ye same juice / and
mix them together with the foresaid powder / as is said of the Cousloppes /
but no more save ones. After take the rotes of Gentian dried / and make a
powder thereof: of thissame powder mix a quarter of an ounce with the foresaid
powder. After that take an ounce and an half of the rote of Peony / made to
powder / and mix it with yt powder specifyed before. Hang also a root of
Peony about the neck. Drink of the foresaid pouders a quarter of an ounce with
blood warm wine / lie down to bed / and cover thy self warm. After that in
thy meat to beddewarde put the other quarter of the powder / and do so while
the powder lasts. Eat little at night / no entrayles of beasts / as heart /
liver / etc. nor sucker / and keep good diet / and thou shall be hole.

To know whether a man be possessed with an evil sprit / and how he may be
helped.
INsania / in Latin signifies Madness / the same comes sometime of evil
meats / Of ragi^g
sometime of ouermuche drinckinge / or if a man being hot / drinks cold
drink / sometime of superfluous slyme that lies in the stomach of meats that
be not well digested / sometime of meats that be hot of complexion / as are
garleke / pepper / and such like. Sometime does it come of the bytynge of a mad
beast / or of an infecte air / or anger / or ouermuche sorrow / sometime also
of evil moisture / or that a man has had no natural siege a great season /
and the corruption is rotten within him / and the vapors are risen up into his
head / and the brains are perfumed and corrupt therewyth / which causes a
man then to be wytlesse and ragious.

Raginge caused by blood
If the madness comes of the blood / then does man singe and is merye /
sometime thinks he / that he is in heaven / or else that some body talks to
him / saying he is God / or an angel: sometime that he is rich and welthy.

Co^geled blood.
But if the madness comes of congeled or burnt blood / the same are sometime
a little merry / after that wax they angrye / cry and beat themselves and
another. Raginge caused by cold and droought.


If it comes of cold and drought / then does he always gloome / weep / and
fear him / that is not to be feared. Sometime thincketh he that the sticks and
strawes he sees / are serpe^tes / todes or such venomous beasts / he crepeth
into the darcke / bends his hands together / wening some body will take
ought out of them: sometime croweth he like a cock / sometime barketh he like a
dog / and many such folish toys uses he.

But if it comes of Flegma / then are his brains corrupt and slymed with
cold / and thereof becomes he mad: Raging^ caused by flegma.
to such one does the devil gladly accompany / and so is he possessed.

He that is becomme mad with sadness and heuinesse / to him ought fair* be
spoken and made merye / many things should be promised him / and some be
given. Sadness or heaviness.
If it is a man / the same ought to be refreshed with weomen / the same auoydeth
anger. But if it is a woman / the same ought to be refreshed with men / and to
their company admitted: the same brings them to their right mind again. It
is good also to give them meats of good digestion / as mutton / chykens / new
laid eggs / white bread and drinks not to strong. If they have no sieges /
then give the^ pillulas cochie to bedward / the same purge the head. It is to
be considered also / that if he have much blood / then ought he to be letten
in the middelmost vein of the forhead: six days after ought he to be letten
blood upon both the hands / by the thombe in the Cephalica. Let him use meats
and drinks cold of complexion / let him not drink wine.

This drink were good for such one.
TAke a dishe full of barley / Licoris an ounce and an half / cut ye same small
and take an handful of Waybred / and seth all this in a quarte of fair water
/ strain it than through a cloth / and let him drink of it. A drink against
raginge.
It is good also to wash his head in lie / where in flowers of Camomille are
sodden and Veruine / of each a hand full in a quarte of water / the same
comfort the head.

If the madness were of Flegma or of superfluous cold / whereby the brains
were cooled / then let him eat meats that may warm him / and let him keep
him self warm: but first ought he be purged of this wise: Cure of raginge
caused by flegma or cold.
Take the leaves of Sena / made to powder a quarte of an ounce / fine sucker
half an ounce / and an eggs shale full of aqua vite / as much of Buglosse
water / as much of good white wine / and so much broth of Peasen / as
altogether: let the same be warm / and put all these things together / and
beat them well: of this give him to drink in the dawninge / or when the day
breaks. If he will not take it by him self / then open his mouth by force /
and pour it into the same. The third day after give him to bedward iij.
pills of cochia / and let no air come to him.

If it is in winter / then keep him warm in a close chamber both night and
day. But if it is in summer / then lay him in a chamber that is somewhat high
/ and make him a fire of Juniper wood / wher^on the berries are / for yt is
very good for him. It were good also to put saffron into his drink and meats
/ his best meats were old hens or cocks well sodden / for they do both
warm and comfort him.

And if he has great heat in his head / then make him this collyrium: Heat.
Take Housleke and leaves of Roses of like quantity / well beaten and mixed
with women's milk / struck the same about his temples / the same couleth the
blood / and alayeth the raginge: let him beware of strong drinks.

Ragyng unknown.
If a man is mad / and it is not known whereof it comes / take the lounge or
lights of a Goat buck / and bind the same warm about his head / the same
alayeth the rage. Or else take a black hen / and open her quick upon the
back / and lay the same so warm to the head. But if it is a woman or maiden
/ then take the lounge or lights of a Goat.

Ragyng of cold.
If a man becomes mad of cold / then were it good forth with to take a
black hen quick / and rippe the same up upon the back / and lay her with
blood and all upon the head: for the same does warm his head and brains very
well.

A good drink for one that rages / and specially if it is come of cold.
A drink for ragi^g of cold.
TAke a quarter of an ounce of beaten saffron / half an ounce of Cinnamon / half an
ounce of aqua vite / and put this into a pint of wine. The speces ought to be
knitt in a linen cloth. And let him drink a good draught thereof in the
morning and eueninge.

Spece^.
It is good also if he use speces in his drink prepared of this wise: Take a
quarter of an ounce of Saffron / Cynamon a quarter of an ounce / Clowes a quarter
of an ounce / Sugar an ounce / make thereof a confection: the same does comfort
the head and brains very well. Or else give him the seeds of Peony beaten small
/ temper the same with wine / and give it him to drink / that gets him his
wits.

A sumigation.
It is good also to take the heart and liver of a fyshe called a Pyck / and put
the same into a pott with glowyng hot cooles / and hold the same to the
patient / so that the smoke may enter into him. If he is possessed / he can
not abide that smoke / but rages and is angry.

It is good also to make a fire in his chamber of Juniper wood that is grene /
and cast into the fire Franckincense and S. Ihons grass or S. Ihons worte:
Fuga dae monu^, or Hypericon.
for the evil spretes can not abide this sent / and wax angrye / whereby may
be perceived whether a man be possessed of an euel spret or not.

The cure of all these evils is (without God will punish them of a several
wise.) They shall take and use two eggs shells full of Aqua vite / and three
times as much of other wine / mixte among it / a quarter of an ounce of powder
of Seen / the same let him use three morninge fasting. A cure general.
Or else let him use Aqua vite / where in is styped fumitory / or the mary of
Walwurt / or the stone Lazulus / or Garmander / or Brake of the wall / which
all do purge black colera or Melancoly: For with purginge black colera / is the
spleen cleansed / and there with avoid the strange thoughts and imaginacions /
the pensiffenesse and melancoly is driven out / and the brains get again
their force or strength / and are increased. Wherefore if this be done / then is
the evil sprete or will driven out / and all wicked thoughts are forgetten.
If man be thus tended / than comes he again to his right natural
understanding. Nevertheless the forsayde medecins must be ministered to him
either when soever the panges come upon him / or when he seems to be fre of
them / that they may minishe by process of time / or else hinder so much the
less. If any child wear Peony sede about his body / no evil sprete can
hinder him.

Item x. or xij. seeds of Peony beaten with wine / and then drunk / avoid the
disease called Incubus / that is the Mare / which is a sycknesse or fantasye
oppressinge a man in his sleep / that him seems a great weight lie upon his
body / wherefore he groneth and sigheth / but can not speak. Incubus or the
Mare.


If a man were desperate or frantike by fantesyes and his wits were spread
abroad / if thou will gather again ye scattered wits: To gather vvittes
stravved.
the^ take a great basin / set it sedelings to a wall / so that it do lean
holy upon the wall / then take a lauer with a cock full of water / set that
high upon a coupborde or other thing / open ye cock a little / so yt the water
drop by little and little upon ye basin / and make a ringinge / and run out of
the basin again. Into this chamber or place lay the patient / so that he can
not se this / nor let not much be spoken to him: then does he muse and fantasye
so much upon yt dropping and ringing / what it may be / willing gladly know
what it is / yt at the last he fasteneth his wits / and gathered them again.
If the water fail / the^ fill ye lauer again. Also may be given to him the
sovereign water of Buglosse.

Of disease in the eyes.
IF one have disease in ye eyes / the same comes of ye four co^plexio^s:
Disease of the eyes.
as namely / if they be moist / yt comes of ye blood / the same his eye^ ar
heavy / and the filthiness yt comes out of the^ / is very unclean / ye veins
of ye temples grieve him. If it be of read colera / then do his eyes smart him
so sore / as though one did prick him into the same with nedles / and they are
very read and hot. The cure
First look the patient have good sieges / and let him beware of things that
are hot / and be quiet. Purge him his head with pills de hiera picra: the
first night let him take v. pills / the second night vij. ye third night ix.
the same do purge his head. Pills cochie do likewise / but of them must he take
no more / save iij. at ones. Let him eschew flesh / but eat fishes without
skales.

This collyrium following is a medicine for the eyes: Collyrium that is a
medicin for sore eyes.
Take the white of eggs / and beat them so long till they wax so thyck / that
if ye put a little straw there in / it stands vpryght: than hold the dishe
wherein thou do beat it upon the one side / and let the thynne run out
into some other vessel: to the same put as much woman milk that sucketh a
boy / and as much water of roses / beat all these together / and wet a fine
linen cloth therein / press it out a little / and lay it upon the eyes ^ til
it waxes dry the / same slaketh the evil heat / and draws it out / and
alayeth strayghtwaye the pain and smarte of the eyes. Do this every hour
ones / and when he will go to bed / then lay them cloth upon his eyes / and
struck of this confection with a fedder into his eyes / the same takes away
the smarte also. But it were very good to lay first the white of an egg and
rose water to his nape of the neck.

Also if the head and eyes do ache / then make a foot bath / A bath for sore
eyes.
and let him sit there in until above the calfe of the leg / cover him
well / that the vapor may stryke up to his body / and chafe him / also rub
him his legs while he sits in the bath. After that take the white of eggs
/ water of Roses and vinegre / of each a like / and beat them together / then
take a fine linen cloth / a span long / and a hand broad / dippe the same into
it / and lay that upon his neck: when the same waxes dry / then let him
wash his fete in cold water / so that they be wet no farther / then the ankles
/ then let him draw them out again straight way / and let him lie down
upon a bed / and let the fete be uncovered / and then lay the collyrium upon
ye eye / and this must he do in the morning / at none and at even: the same
draws out the evil heat / and alayeth te pain / and is often times proved.

Experience.
The rote of Pilletory taken in the mouth in the morninge and at even knawed /
but not eaten / and then the mouth washed with half vinegre and half water:
the same draws down the heat through the mouth / and minisheth the heat in
the head and eyes.

Reed eyes.
But if the eyes remain read / then take of that water that stands in the
leaves of wild Tasill / and put that into the eyes: or else the water that
droppeth out of the veins in march / when they be most communlye cut and
bound up / put thereto the third part as much white of an egg beaten. Also
if a read spott or a bloody mark did remain in the eyes / the^ take the white
bladder / having at the yolke of an egg / called the chycken / put that in the
eye in the morning and even.

VVeke eyes or sight.
If a pore body has weak eyes or sight / will thou keep them that they wax no
worse / take the tongue of a fox / and hang the same about his neck / and so
long it hangs there / shall not the sight wax feable nor weak / as says
Pliny. Likewise does it also to him / that eats or knaweth every morninge
fasting five or six seeds of Juniper / and holds the nethermost lip above
the upper / and holdinge his hand before his mouth / blows / and receives
the breath into his eyes.

Spots i^ the eye^.
For spots in the eyes / take the herb Veruayne with his rote and hole the
substance / tie the same about thy throat / and wear it / until the spots
perish and fayde: the herb may be sowed with a linen cloth about the neck.

Spur blind.
If one were spur blind / which also is caused by superfluous humiditye of
the head / when the veins of the sight are stopped with pain / and yet are
the eyes fair and clear / so that a man can not perceive he is spurr blind /
without one do take good head. At the last gets he many syckely and weke
veins or spots about the forhead. The appel or ball of the eye of some men
does break / so that the innermost of them does rotte / and the sight of the
eye perishes: the same also have often pain in the head. But this disease do
lightely great women whose flowers fail before it be time / and specially women
that have cold heads. If this were looked to otherwhyles / a man might well be
helped / with giving a quarter of an ounce of Iera pirra that he were purged: he
must beware also of things that cause evil humores and of inordinate
meatinge or drinkinge.

Runnige eyes.
If a man's eyes do run of superfluous humiditye / then lay Walnut leaves in
cold water / and to bedwarde shake the leaves that the water avoid from the
leaves / and lay one of them upon the one eye: and when it waxes dry / lay
an other upon it / the same draws the evil moisture and heat out of it /
and cleanses the eyes.

He that has a dymme sight / let him take the water of Dandelion or of Cicory
/ and put the same into his eyes / and they shall wax clear. Dymme syghte.


He that has read or running eyes / let him take the water that stands in
the wild Tasill leaves / or else water of the vynestock / the weight of half an
ounce / and the weight of ten corns or greynes of white Amber: Read or running
eyes.
put ye same into a glass / and let it stand viij. days before ye occupy it
/ shake or stere it every day three or four times in the day: the elder it is
/ the better is it.

The rote of Veruin or cut Malow / called in Latin Alcea / hanged about the
neck / drives away spots and blemishes of the eyes / whether it be in a man
/ or horse / as I Jerome of Brunsweig / author of this treatise / have sen my
self. Spots or blemishes i^ the eyes.
I have also myself done it to a blind horse / yt was first bought for x.
crounes / and was sold again for xl. crounes / the which was hanged the root
about the neck / and gave him the herb chapped with his meat or prouander.

He that has gotten dust or such other thing into his eyes / let him lie upon
his back / and let him put into his eye^ iij. or iiij. seeds of Clary / let him
clese his eyes / and than do they roll about into the eyes / and draw ye dust
with them. Duste in the eyes
This is proved by the wild clary / called communly Oculus Christies sede /
that it does so. The stones also found in the mawe of swalowes / and specially
young ones / do likewise.

To heal all manner disease of the ears.
Sometime is the hearing lost clean / so that a man hears nothing at al / or
a little. Diseas of the ears
He that is so diseased / must be laid in the sun in summer / and look into
his ears / whether ought be fallen into them: or else whether an apostemacion /
or bluster / or any other thing be in it / whereby his hearing might fail.
But if nothing is found nor seen in therein / then is it sure / yt the grefe
comes from within ye head / of some vapor yt is gathered there / where by the
hearing is stopped / or else of some apostemacion in ye head / where ye organes
of hearing are. And he yt is so diseased / speaks so softly / yt he can
scarsely be understand / and is troubled with sleep. Cure.
To the same ought be given iij. pills de iera picra Galeni / the same draw the
humors from ye ears and head / and cause him to nyse. After yt set boxes upon
the one ear / to draw the fylt out of ye head. But if a man is lette^ blood in
the head out of scason / the same hurts him sore / and causes him to become
deaf.

If a man have a sounding or piping in his ears / the same comes sometime of a
hot slymy fylthynesse / or of a hot slymy moystnesse. Sou^ding in the ears.
He that is so diseased / ought to take pills de iera picra / and then put
oil of Hempsede warm into his ears / mixed with a little vinegre / after yt let
him leap upon his one leg / upon that side / where the disease is / than let
him bow down ye ear of that side / if happily any moisture or fylth would
issue out.

This disease comes sometime of the Summer heat: he that is diseased thereof /
has great heat in his head. Put woman milk and Hemsede oil mixte together
into his ear / on that side where he is diseased / that alayeth the heat.

Let him that is deaf take a handful of Rue or Herb grace / Cure of deaf.
and chappe or cut the same small / and put it into a new pot with a pound of
good vinegre / cover it close / and put it to the fire / and let it seth / that
it run over. Then let him go into the hot house / and when he does sweat
well / take a thonnel with a long pype / yt he may cover the pot holy
therewyth / make hot the pot / and let the vapor go through the thonnel into
the ear. If it be in winter / and can have no Rue / then seth beans of one
year in water / and do likewise. If ye have no beans another / than take
Heysede upon a heyelift sotten in water / and use the same as is said of the Rue
/ so hot as ye can suffer it.

Sou^ding i^ the head.
Against the soundynge and whysperinge in the head / put warm water into a
lauer / and let it drop softely upon the hindermost of the patientes head /
by this droppinge is the soundynge and noise in the head taken away. And when
the lauer is emptye / then fill it again / until the pain is away.

Hearing evil.
He that hears evil / let him seth Juniper berryes and Sauin of like
quantity in good wine / put into a new pot / well dressed and stopped: then
let him bore a hole thorough the lidde of it / and lay his ears upon the hole
/ to receive the same vapor.

Against soundyng and ringinge in the ears.
Sou^ding in the ears.
IN May bore a hole in an Ash tree about the mids / put a read or such like
thing into the same hole / and set a vessel or pot by the tree / under the read
/ let it so stand five or six days / then shall run clear water out of
the tree. This water put into some vessel and make it warm / hold the ear
over the vapor of it / and make as it were a tente of a sponge / wett the same
in the water / and cleanse the ear therewyth in the morninge and even / and the
soundinge or whyspering in the ear shall go away.

Of blethynge at the nose / and staunchynge of the same.
Blething at the nose.
BLething at the nose is sometime good / sometime evil. He that has a Catharre /
that is a rewme or stillinge down of humores in the head / or an apostemacion
/ blethinge at the nose / is good for him. It is also a good token / if the
blood waxes to hot in the body / and runs up into the head / and fylleth
the veins so sore / that they do breast. If the blood then come forth at the
right nose trill / the^ let him blood at the Cephalica upon the same side upon
the hand / by the thombe. But if the blood comes forth at the left nosetrill
/ then tie his leg above yt kne with a strong list or swadeling band / then
remains the blood in yt leg: after that beat eggs shales to powder / and
syft then through a linen cloth / and blewe them into his nose: if the shales
were of eggs / whereout young chickens are hatched / it were so much the
better. Or else take the dounge of an ass / mix the same with vinegre / and
hold the same at his nose. Likewise does the dounge of a Sow or Swyne that
has eaten grass. Stau^chi^g of blood


He that bletheth so sore / that nothing can staunche him / it is good to tie
his fourth finger / or finger next the little finger of the same side so fast /
do he do so even swell: for that stauncheth the blood / and specially on the
left hand.

It is good also to tie ye herb called Shepherdes burse about his neck / or
else give it him to hold in his hand / until it waxes warm / and dight it
in his meat. Or else take a soft linen cloth / the length and breadth about of
half a yard / wett the same in cold water: but if ye have vinegre / take of
like quantity / and tie it about his preuy membre. If it is a woman / then let
her hold it to her priuities. And if ye have no vinegre / then bind him the
cloth about his neck / dipped in water only / and when it waxes warm / than
wett it again. It is to be considered / that thou do lose his gyrdel / and set
him vpryght / lest he do hang forward.

It is to be noted / that blethyng is caused sometime in yt time of a disease /
or in the amendinge / and this last is good / wherefore it ought not to be
staunched: The profit of blething Tokens of blethyng.
without he did bleth to sore / whereof the patient might be the more feeble /
and therefore ought he to be helped / lest he wax to weak. If the blood come
out from the head / so that a man has gotten a risinge of the blood into the
head / that shall thou know thereby: he has pain in the forhead: the same
must be letten blood in the Cephalica / that is ye urine of the head. But if
the superfluity of blood or blething comes of ye liver / then has he pain in
ye right side with a stiche: the same ought to be lette^ blood on the right hand
/ by ye little finger / in ye vein of ye liver. But if the blood comes of ye
spleen / tha^ has he pain in ye left side with a stich: the same ought to be
lette^ blood on the left hand / by the little finger in ye vein of the spleen:
the same also ought not be gyrded / nor yet wear any weight about his body /
nether deck him warm: he must beware also of all that might warm him / and be
quiet. Nota.
It is to be marked / that when he that has the pestilence bledeth / and can
not be staunched / nor cease / it is an evident and sure token of death.

Of spots and blemishes of the face.
IF a man has spots or blemishes in the face or under the eyes / or where
they be / take the rote of Couckoupintel or Wake robin / stamp the same / and
struck the juice there of in the morninge and evening upon them / and they go
away. Spots in (...)
Or else take the stone growing of wine life / beat the same very small / and
hang it with a cloth in a moist sellar / set something under it / for out of it
shall drop water: with the same anoint the spots under the eyes often times /
but beware it come not into the eyes. Or else anoint thy selfs with the water yt
stands in the wild Tasill leaves / or else with the water yt droppeth out of
the Vine / when he is cut and bound up in March / the same do often. Or else
anoint the spots often with the juice of the rote of Briony or wild neppe /
beaten and strayned.

Against a fistula by the nose / take the slyme of a sowes guts / and burn
that to powder / put the same powder into the disease / it heals the same / for
it has been expe^imented. A fistula by the nose.


Against evil scabbinesse or schilfering chekes / that will not heal nor fall
down.
Take onyons and white Lily roots of like quantity / roste them in ashes /
shell them and make them clean / then strain them through a cloth / put
thereto oil of Roses / and struck this upon the sore. Scabbye chekes.


Against the fistula in the cheke.
A fistula in the cheke.
Mark which touth stands next to the sore / the same draw out / and cleanse
the hole: take the rote of that drawn touth / and put it into the sore /
hereof is the sore healed.

Of all diseases of the mouth and his appertenances.
Diseases of the mouth.
Against the stinking of the mouth / chawe often in the day herb called Cinkfoly
or fyuefyngered grass / and it shall go away in four days.

If ye have eaten garleke / and your breath sauoureth strong after the^ / eat
the leaves of Rue or herb grace / and it shall not be perceived with you.

If a man have great heat and drought in his mouth / so that he thinks his
mouth will burn / then take the water of March ^se in thy mouth / that
slaketh it. But if thou haste not that / lay four or six flinte stones / so
big as a Walnut in cold water / and take always one of them into thy mouth /
and hold it therein: and when it waxes warm / take it out / and lay it in
cold water again / and take another into thy mouth. This does much good / and
slaketh also the thyrst.

Of all diseases of the teth.
The vse^ and diseases of the teth.
THe teth are created to chawe the meat therewith / that it may be the more
apt to digestion / they aid also to the speech / to retayn the breath / and to
man^^dorning or continesse. They have (...) pain and sinerte / as other
members or lymmes / namely knawynge / holes / worms / wagging / apostemation
in the gummes / corrupt humors and blood of the gummes.

A sure medicine for toothake.
A sure medicin for tothake.
TAke a garlyke head / pil it / beat it in a mortar / that it wax soft / moisty
/ and that it be not hole: and look on what cheke or side the toth ache is / on
that arm bind the garlike / upon the wrest of the arm / where boxes are set
most communly / so that it do not touch the mousse of the hand / and lay it
as nere together as ye can: cover it with a spoune or broad Walnutshell a hole
night / and then will it cast a bluster: pearse the same through / or else will
it burst by it self. But if ye will have it run sore / take a leaf of
Danwurt or Walwurt / and turn the rough side inwardely. And if thou will have
it to heal / then take the Walwurt leaf / and turn the smoth side inwardely
/ and it heals.

To make a tooth so fall without smarte.
SEth as many little grene frogs / brething or sitting upon trees / as thou
can get in water / until the flesh do consume: To make ^ teth fall out
with out smart
take the fatt flowyng upon them / and keep it in a clean thing / and when need
is / anoynte the teth therwyth. But take heed / that thou do not touch the
other likewise / or else consumes it the other also. Likewise does the touth of
a dead man / if one touch there with the sore touth: but let him that does it
beware / lest he touch any more / for they fall out also / without any smarte.

The graye worms brething under wood or stones / having many fete / and when
they be touched / do they cluster together like porkenpickes: these persed
through with a botken or like thing / and then put into the touth yt aketh /
alayeth the pain. Likewise does also a little slyce of the rote of Acorus / of
some called in English Gladen / of other Galanga / which grows in waters and
marasses / this must be laid grene upon the touth. A piece of the grene rote of
Termentil does likewise.

Of the swellinge in the rote of the mouth / called in Latin Vua or Vuula.
THe swelling that is caused of a cold slimy humor / falling out of ye head /
and hanginge in the rofe of a man's mouth / is called in Latin Vuula / which
hinders a man of his speech: this shall be cured of this wise: Svvelli^g in the
throat.
If it is of superfluous blood / then is the disease read / long and great /
and the veins ^f the forheade are gross and swollen / then let him blood in
the Cephalica upon the hand. But if it comes of other accidents / as of
superfluous moisture and cold / then take white dogs torde that is dry / and
make it to powder / and take commune salt / and dry it in a pan upon the
fire / so yt it wax eue^ broune: braye the same of like quantitye together to
powder / put that to the swellinge or disease: for it is good and upright.

Or else bye white Frankincense / cast a piece of it upon hot coals: put a
thunnel over it / and let the smoke thereof go into thy throt / that helps /
and is often times experimented or proved.

Or else take Sal armoniacum / and make a powder thereof / and heave the swelling
up therewyth.

It is very good to let him blood under the tongue / or else upon both the
thumbes / when the disease begins: for it helps him. Some do cut it of:
but that is dangerous. They that be so diseased / must beware for cold drinks
/ and specially of milk and chese.

An other experience for the swelling in the rofe of the mouth / or else him yt
can not well take breath / which I have often showed poor people / namely / to
pull ye patient sore by ye earlap vpwardly / and incontinently shall he be
healed.

How to help one that has the Squince in the throat / called the Squinancia.
THe Squince or Squinancy is an apostem in ye throat / and is very dangerous.
If it comes in a sickness / then is it dangerous / and if it comes in an ague
/ the^ is it not so dangerous. To such a patie^t ought to be given gruell of
otmeel / well lifted through a cloth / and put thereto ten or twelve almondes
well bea^en: and when it is dressed in a vessel / put a little suker to it / and
^atso with bread. But if he has an ague with it / give him of a quillis of a
cock without bread / and make him a drink of this wise: Take of Lycoris /
cut small j. ounces of suker haf an ounce / seth the^ in water / skin it well /
and let him hold it away a little in the mouth / and wambel it roundabout in
the mouth. Make him also this plaster to lay outwardely.

Cure of squinacy
Take white dogs dyrte three ounces / Dittanye beaten powder an ounce / grene
Wormwod brayed small an ounce / half an ounce of barley flower: mix these al
together with honey / struck it upon a cloth / and lay it warm about his neck.
This plaster has healed many / it heals a man / or else dies he ye fyft
day. Sometime breaks ye swellynge out outwardely / but ye inward is deadly
for it does lyghtely choke a man. It is therefore diligently to be marked what
occasion of ye disease has. If it comes of reed Colera / which is ho^e and
dry / than has ye pacient great pain and anguyshe / and with ye great hea^e
and thyrste. Make him a plaster outwardely about his neck of Popular leaves
and sede / sees it well / and temper it with oil of violets and Camomille /
and struck yt upon a clothe / and lay it warm about the neck.

But if ye can not have yt oil / take the leaves of Elder / leaves of reed
kole / of each a handefull / chapped small and brayed / sees them with honey and
butter / of each a spounfull. Lay this warm about his neck.

Thyssame has helped and healed many: or else make him any of the playsters of
the swalowes nest following.

But if the Squynce is of superfluous blood and heat / than must he be let
blood incontinent in the right hand upon ye thombe in ye Cephalica / and
under ye tunge: In ye hand upon four ounces / and under ye tunge upon two
ounces. And as soon he is letten blood / must be made this drink for him to
gargelle: take about five ounces of Diamoron / take one ounce thereof mixte with
warm water / hold yt in the mouth / gargell therewy^h and spytt it out /
cause him to do this five times. The next day let boxes be set upon his neck
/ without scrapynge / these should draw ye blood from thence. Or else bind
about his neck / as I have taught before / and let this byndynge be three times
within day and night / at every time a quarter of an hour.

Make him this plaster: Take the nest of a swalowe or pie / but ye swalowes
nest is the best with all the substance / as claye / gravel / styckes or
feathers / nothing except / beat it / and syft it through a course syffe / so
that it may be fined / put thereto honey and grease / and make a plaster there
of / struck it upon a cloth / and lay it about his neck. Of this wise have I
helped one in iij. hours space. Item make him this drink: Take Licorys / Anis
/ Fygges and great Raysons / of each an ounce / sees them in a pottel of water
/ and give him every time thereof to drink.

But if thou can not have these things / and art far from ye Physician /
and have a swellinge in thy throat / than is nothing better than to take warm
Mylla and gargel the same as hot thou can suffer it: this done often / takes
away ye sycknesse / and mollifyeth ye apostemacion. Likewise may be done with
mylcke or water / wherein is sodden knapwede / otherwise called Deuels bit. And
when ye apostemacion is broken / give him warm yolks of eggs that be soft /
and barley gruel / and give him to drink water / wherein Barley is sodden / that
purges and heals him.

For the hoorsnesse.
HE yt is waxen hoorse by reason of an humor descending / or coughinge / of a
cold air or drink / of creyng or weping: Horsnes and the causes thereof.
let the same drink in the morninge warm water / as hot he can suffer it /
and wet a linen cloth in half water and half vinegre / wringe it well out /
and wind it about the neck / and another that is warmed upon the same: do
this in the morning / at middaye and to bedwarde / let him keep him warm and
beware of cold air. If he could sweat in the bed / that were very good.
Let him also beware of cold drinks / fruytes / grapes / and such like.

He may also drink warm milk / in the morning and evening / the same does
avoid horsenesse also. Or else take Aqua vite when thou will go to bed / stipe
a piece of bread therein / and eat the same at even and morning: but if he is of
hot complexion / then is Aqua vite not good for him.

He that is so hoorse / that the lights seem to ascend into his throat / and
he is of cold and moist complexion / the same should drink fasting a quarter of
an ounce of oil Benedicti / mixed with a little water / though it be unpleasant
to drink / yet is it good and without danger. But if ye can not have the oil
/ then eat Anis sede: the same is wholesome and good for the horsenes. Or else
sede the karnels of Quinches / and drink that water warm to bedwarde. Or else
take three ounces and an half of flint stones / put to them a quart of springing
water / and seth it to the half / drink thereof blood warm in yt morning and
at even / and it shall go away. Or else give him this drink following: Take
wine and oil of olive of like quantity / seth them in some thing and drink
thereof so hot thou can at night / and in the morning a good draught: the same
takes the horsenesse away without danger. But if thou can not have oil of
olyue / then take half so much butter as the wine is / and do as is said
before.

A confection to hold in the mouth against hoorsenesse.
TAke fine mustard sede mele / put thereto four times the weight of honey /
make thereof a confection / put it upon a trenscher / and cut in pieces: but set
in a cool place for meltinge / and hold one of these slyces in thy mouth in
the morning and eueninge / and let them melte by them selves.

Or else give him this drink: A drink for horsenesse.
Take Penyreal a hand full / cut it small / and seth it with a pint of vinegre /
till the third part is sodden in / then strain it through a cloth / and give
the patient to drink thereof in the morning and evening always a spounfull. Or
else take a great appel / roste the same well / slice it / and lay it hot in a
dishe with water / and eat it. This ought to be done to bedwarde / and cover
thy self well and warm / put thy head under the covering as far thou can /
or else cover thy head and face that no air come into thy mouth: the same is
good / and drives away horsenesse.

He that is become hoorse lately / let him roste a rape in ashes or upon the
fire / yt she be all black / then pare her clean / and eat her as warm thou
can: and drink a draught of water as warm thou can suffer it. Then wett a
cloth in cold water / strain it well out / and wind it so about thy neck:
upon the same bind another cloth well warmed / and do this when thou go to
bed / and in the morninge / for it drives hoorsenesse away without danger.

An experimented science for horsenesse though it has long lasted.
Against ^n old horsenes
TAke a soft night kerchyf and warm it / take also a head pelow / warm
the same also / and bind it with the kerchyf about the head and neck / when thou will go to bed / and let it be so about thy head all night. Do this thr^
nights one after the other / and keep thy self warm / and beware of cold
drinks and air / and it shall surely go from thy without hurt. This same is
good also for the flixe and cough. Give the patient also Lycoris in his mouth.

Against horsenesse go into the hot house / and when thou have half bathed /
drink a good draught of warm water. This is often proved.

Garl^k sodden and eaten makes a clear voice / and drives away horsenesse
and the old cough.

Of the yexe or yexinge.
The yexe and his causes.
THe yexe comes sometime by reason of the superfluous emptynesse of the body:
sometime of superfluous fill of the stomak. If it comes by reason of the
emptiness / that signifies the sick or patient sufficiently / whether he has
a long season not eaten or dronken / or else whether he has had outrageous
sieges. Him shall thou h^lpe of this wise: Seth an old hen with a quarter of an
ounce of Cinamome / and a quarter of an ounce of Mastix / and give him that broth
to drink / and the hen to eat. Give him also Hogs fete and white wine. If he
be not hot / give him confect of Quinches: but if he has great heat / then
give him sukar of Roses.

Fill of the stomach.
But if it is of superfluous eatinge and drinkinge / then make him to perbreake
with Oken leaves / or else as I shall teach you hereafter in the chapter of
vomiting. Or else take a cake of roses and Wormwod / of like quantity / of each
a handful / and seth that in read wine / and lay it wa^me upon the stomach.
Or else let him say ought wherewyth he may be sore astonished / and he shall be
rid of the yexinge. But if a man does yexe sore in a sycknes / it signifies
most communely death.

Of suppuration or matteringe in the breast.
Suppuratio^ in the breast.
HE that has a mattering in ye breast caused of cold / ought to beware for cold
/ and eschew the air / let him lie high or sit upright / let him not sleep
much / and in his sleep ought he be waked otherwhiles / yt he may himme. Make
him a butter suppe of half water and half butter / let that be well sodden /
and put not much bread therein / and eat that broth as hot as he can.
The Same broth let him drink to bedwarde / that weakeneth the corrupcion very
well / and makes it apt to be cast out. Also ought little meat be given him at
ones / and little drink: for the corruption grows ye more of much eatinge
and drinking^. Let him always be hungery and thyrstye / nether eat any fishes
nor speces / nether drink any sour drink. A syrop of Violettes were good for
him: but if ye have not that syrop / tha^ make a milk of Hempsede / of water
and hempsede / or else instead thereof take creme / and eat that / the same
cools and softeneth the heart without hurt or danger. After meat ought he
to walk a little / having always a warm cloth before his mouth / that the
air do not hurt him: for of the walkinge does the corruption louse.

Ye must also take diligent head that he have good sieges. Also were it good he
did sweat in the bed if he be so strong / or else to cause him to sweat with
a bath made in a kettel / and so to lay him to bed to sweat. This bath ought to
be made with Valerian and Ootstrawe / and covered with warm shetes / for these
things weaken the corruption.

Item / roast onyons / and eat them / a little butter therein / were very good.

He that has a dry cough / and does not cast out / it is an evident toke^ /
that the same has an evil stomach / that does not well digest / whereby are
caused many greueous diseases. A dry cough.
But if he voideth spatle that is whyt / mixed with blood / and that with pain
/ the same is a sign of a privy digestion / and of a disease of the pulino or
lights / and that is deadly.

But if he casts out afterward without smarte / which nevertheless is a
little redish / the same is a sign of appearance of digestion / and nature
begins to cleanse / and is perfect.

He that has a cough with pain in ye breast / the same ought not to bath in
water / another eat nuttes / nor oil of nuttes / nor poppye sede oil: Cough
with pain in the breast
but let him drink water sodden. If his cough comes by cold / then let
him drink good wine.

A man that has great disease in the breast / and also in the head / if thou will help him / and purge the head and breast wounderfullye of all slymye
fleumes and fylth / without any cost: Pain in the breast and head
Take two or three rotes of Bet^ / wash them clean / and dry them well / then
braye them small / strain the^ through a cloth / and a very blewe juice shall
come out of them: upon that shall ye se a white foam / blow the same away /
and take of that juice three or four drops in a quill / and draw it into thy
head through the noses: or else fill a fylberts shell full of it / and draw it
so in through the nose. Then clise thine eyes and nose with both thy hands /
and within a quarter of an hour issues a great deal of slymye moystnesse
out of thy mouth / whereof a man may maruayle. Experience.
I have ones seen six ounces run out of a man's mouth at one time. And out of
mine oune mouth is of this wise four ounces run out / where I thought I should
have had none at all.

Of an imposteme in the breast.
The cause of an imposteme is of superfluous evil flegma in the head or
stomach: The cause of apostemes.
wherefore when the head and stomach are purged of the flegma / then go the
apostemes away also by themselves. Let the patient eat little or nothing /
and that meats of good digestion.

A drink for apostemes.
Make him this drink: Take Maiden heir / called also Cola^der / whyt Endive /
Scabiose / Morsus diaboli / yt is / Deuels bit / of each a handful: Barley
pilled or puched / an eggs shel full / waters so much as is convenient / or else
ij. quartes: seth these ij. finger breadth away. After that streyne the^
through a cloth: and of yt make a he^psede milk / with a good porenger full of
washe^ he^psede: of ye same give him half a good cruys full to drink blood
warm in the morning and at night. But if ye have not ye herbs / then make a
he^psede milk with barley only / and drink that half a cruys of goblet full.

A salf for apostems
After that make him this salve / and anoynte him therewyth about the breast.
Take fresh butter or creme / or else both in like quantity / seth therein leaves
/ and the sede of Malowes / streyne it than through a cloth / and anoint his
breast therewith. If ye put capons greece thereto / yt were very good. After that
were it good to make him a clister or a suppository as is perteyning hereto.
And this ought every Physicion know and search of what complexion ye patie^t
is / and whence ye disease comes / and what medicine is convenient for it.
For if the Physicion does it not / and ministers to him that which is contrary
to his nature or complexion / than does he misorder the patie^t / and is gilty
of his pain or happily death. For this cause ought no Physicion to trust to
his science nor wisdom only / but ask and enquire of ye patie^t or other al
circumstances / to what fashion ye disease does incline. He ought also to se
and vewe ye vrin feel ye pulse / and to behold the patientes phisiognomy. The^
may the Physicion minister to ye patie^t so much ye more boldlier medicines /
according to ye science: and to such a Physicion may a man trust so much the
better: for he may be called a true Physicion. For apostemes in ye breast are
dangerous / and therefore is it true and necessary / to know by what complexion
or te^peratur ye diseases are caused. Aposte^s of Colera.

Aposte^s for flegma or cold.


If ye disease comes of read Colera / or blood / the^ ought ye to minister ye
patie^t al such things / as I have taught in ye precede^t chapter. But if it
is caused by flegma or cold / then make him this salve / and anoint him about
the breast. Take an ounce of butter / capon or hens greece an ounce / oil of
Baye or sorel half an ounce / and mix them together / and anoint him about the
breast therewith / and lay unwashed wolle thereupon that is black. But he must
refrain from salt meats / and of all sour meats.

Against breakinge up and vomiting.
Against perbreakynge.
TAke a piece of bread stiped in salt and vinegre / bruise it / and make it like a
thick plaster / and lay it upon ye cheste or hearts holownesse / where the
mouth of the stomach is. And if ye struck it about ye patientes mouth / yt
comfort him / and gives him strength.

Item ye water wherein karnels of quinches have lain or stiped / ye same
refrayneth the breaking up of the stomach: for it comfort ye stomak / and
makes good digestion. But when ye time of the quinches is / then may they be
sodden alone / without sucker and honey / instead of confect for ye heart / and
so used.

The right making of Ptisana / that is / Barley water.
Barley water / communly called Ptisana / is praised and commended of all
Physicions / and is a sovereign medicine against all colerik and subtle heat
/ it opens the oppilacion or stopping / it moves sweat and urine / it
mollifyeth ye belly bound with hard fylth / it causes sleep / and alayeth
thyrst / it does also partly norish / it is convenient for all parts of the
breast and the poulmon.

Ptisana is taken sometime warm / to cause sweat / sometime cold to alay thyrst
/ sometime with suker / sometime without suker / sometime much / sometime little. The
ministratio^ thereof at one time is is a cruys full / that is iiij. ounces /
howbeit it must be ministered to an emptye stomach / or at the lest not
ouercharged. It is sometime taken by day of the thirsty diseased / and is
convenient in fervent agues and many other diseases.

Take fulgrowen barley that is heavy / and not wythered / take also clear running
water / yt has his course toward the East / whose ground is stony or sandy.
Of this water take x. parts / and of the barley one part: Making^ of Barley
water.
put them together into a clean pot / make a slow fire under it of wood twelf
hours long till the water is colored of the barley yalow read / like to bier:
after that take it of and let it cool / and use it.

How he may be helped that speweth blood.
HEmoptoica is a disease / when a man speweth blood at ye mouth / whereof the
cause is superfluity of blood / and this shall be known of this wise: Spevvi^g
of blood
he is full of body and redish / his veins are great. Sometime comes it out
of the stomach / and then has the patient pain in ye breast before. But if it
comes of the lever / then has he pain in the right side. And if it comes
of the lunges or lights / then has he pain in the left side / and cougheth
much. Sometime does it also come of falling or ryottinge / and the^ must he be
helped of this sort: He must beware of anger / of long fasting / of sour or
bitter meats and drinks / and of surfeiting. The cur^
He ought to be let blood on the same hand / where the disease is. If it is of
the lever / then must he be let blood in the right hand: but if it is of the
lunges / then ought he to be let blood on the left hand / and give him this
medicine.

Take Plantayn and wild Tasil / with ye water yt stands in the Tasil / put
thereto reyne water / and streyne it through a cloth: of this give the patient
to drink in the morning fasting and to bedward. But if the wild Tasil have no
juice / then seth it in reyne water / bray it / and strayn it through a cloth /
cast the herb away: then take the broth / put suker thereto / and give it the
patie^t to drink. Give him also in the morning and evening to drink goats
milk / or powder made of moulberries: or else give him to drink reyn water
wherein are sodden shepeherdes purse / knotgrasse and waybred / braye them when
they are sodden / streyne them through a cloth / and give him to drink thereof
three times in the day / every time a good draught. Give him also three days
one after the other to eat wheat with water and butter.

If one speweth out matter.
The Same may he helped of this wise: Give him Diapenidion or diagaga^tu^. Ye
must mark also / that if ye lay the matter or corruption / that he voydeth
upon hot coals / and it stynketh / then signifies it the rotting of the
poulme or lights / which is very evil and deadly: to such one ought no man to
minister medicine / for he is to sore sick.

But if he have great heat in his sycknesse / then say al Physicions / that
nothing is better / then to give him to drink barley water. This heat is
known by the urine / whether it be great or not / by the chance of the vrin /
and the thycke of it synketh to the bottom. But if the disease will last long
/ then give the pacient what he lysteth / and if he waxes a little stronger
there of / then give him more: if not / give him no more. Ye must mark also /
that if he be sick of an ague or like disease / then let him be given what
he lists / while the disease lasts.

When one would gladly perbreake / and can not do it.
Perbreaking of a diseased stomach.
THe perbreakinge happens many ways: sometime by the disease of the stomach /
as namely / when the stomach casts from the bottom yt meat / and can not
keep it / which happens that the nethermoste part of the stomach is stronger
then the uppermost. The cause of this must be considered by the same that is
wyded.

Perbreakinge by grefe of the stone
Sometime comes it by the grefe of the stone / or else the corruption then will
grow to matter / that there of he does perbreake. Thissame is well perceived by
the urine / and also whether he has pain in the loins / bladder / or back.

Perbreakinge of cold moystnesse.
If the perbreaking comes of cold moistness or humors / then is it yelowe. It
is to be known / that ye ought not to staunche that perbreakinge until the
stomach be cleansed of the evil humors / after that ought it to be provided.

If the perbreakinge be sound and hard / that the patient can have no sieges
/ then give him Cassia fistula / and cleanse him. Perbreaking that is hard.


But if the perbreakinge is of the read Colera / by reason of a hot stomach /
then give him sour bitter Pears to eat / or else give him Sorell to drink /
or else give him syrop of Violettes to drink with water in the morning and
evening. Perbreakinge of read Colera.


Item medlers eaten fasting / wythstande perbreakinge caused by heat. Likewise
does Minte eaten fasting / and Anis eaten mornings and eueninges.

Or else take a cold flynt stone / and hold it to the neck of the patient /
and the perbreakinge cease. Or else take a hand full of feathers / and put them
in to a pot / and put to them glowynge hot coals / and hold thy mouth over it
wide open / that the vapor or smoke may go into it / and then shall the
wamblinge cease. Perbreakinge of black Colera.


But if the perbreakinge comes of the black Colera / then set boxes of each
side of his neck.

Of Flegma.
But if it is caused of Flegma / then take Wormwod / Mugworte / Hirse or Millot
vnstamped of each four ounces. Put all these into a little sack or bag / and
quilte them so / that they cluster not / and seth them in half wine and half
water / wringe it then out / that it drop no more / and lay it then warm
upon his breast: the same warmeth his body and cold stomak / and alayeth the
wambling and perkreakinge. It helps also a woman with child that has
ouermuche wamblinge. Also does it help them that have the stone engendered of
cold / and must bow themselves much / it does also alaye grepinges.

If the perbreaking comes of cold / or else of cold and moist humors /
Perbreakinge of cold.
either in a man or woman / then take Cumin / and make four bags / each a
span long and broad / put in each of the bags an ounce of Cumin / and quilt
the same bags croswyse / that the Cumin do not cluster / and seth the same in
a quart of vinegre / and bind one of the^ upon each wrest of the hand as warm
as it may be suffered / and likewise upon the wrast or ioynture of the fete. And
when they wax cold / warm the^ again in ye same liquor / wherein they were
sodden / and lay the^ up again as before / and of this wise cease the
perbreaking continently without danger. And give the patient a broth of gray
peasen wherein Cumin is sodden / and let him drink good strong drink / and let
him put at every breakfast a penny weight of beaten saffron therein / ye same
comforts ye brains and stomak / and refrayneth ye wambling or perbreakinge:
but he must bewar of such things as cool him. Howbeit some co^plexions ca^
not away with saffron and abhor it: for it causes a lothsomnesse: let the
same drink water of Buglosse and Porcelene / the same comfort the head also.

But if the perbreaking would not hold up / then make him a bag of half an
elle in length and breadth / and put therein Cumin / and dress the same as is
said before / seth it in vinegre / and lay it warm upon the navel / as warm
as thou can suffer it: and when it waxes cold / warm it again: with this is
alayed the perbreakinge / and also does this wythstande the grepinge.

But if one had a wamblinge / and did perbreake / and wist not for what cause /
or whereby it comes / let the same take the leaves of Quenches / and bind
them upon the wrast of the hands / that alayeth it: Perbreakynge whose cause
is unknown.
the grener yt leaves be / the better be they. Yet if one would keep the^ in
store for winter / let him pluck them of from the trees before our Ladies day /
the xv. day of August / and let them dry out of the Son.

Against perbreakinge take half an ounce of Betonye powder / and two ounces of
honey / make a confection therewyth / and give the patiente thereof every day
fasting.

Medlers eaten / do wythstande perbreakinge / comfort the stomak / and refrain
wamblinge.

I myself have had a woman / which was accustumed every morning / to void at
the mouth about two eggs shelles full of unclean slyme of clammy flegmatish
matter: the same was taught to take a certain space every morninge a warm
slyce of bread / roasted with salt / and that alayeth the perbreakinge.

But if a man had eaten ought / or had slymy matter within him / and would
feign be rid of it: To cause perbreakinge.
to cast the same out by perbreaking / let him take white nisynge powder /
called Lingworte / about the third part of a dram / and use it in a broth
of peasen / and it shall continently break from him. But if thou can not
have Lingwort or Nising powder / then take the root of Elder / and pyll the
uppermost shell of it when it is crene / wash it / and b^ay it in a mortar /
and give him it in a warm peasebroth. As for nising powder belonged to strong
complexioned folk to use / and not over the weight that I have above
specifyed: For I was called by a man / that had taken nisinge powder or
Lingwort / a little bag full / as is commenly sold / and had eaten the same /
supposinge therewyth to drive away from him / such fylth and slime / as he had
in his stomak. And as soon as he had taken it / furthwyth had he such a rage
and grepyng within him / that easily was seen the stomach rise up and down /
even to the neck / and a cold sweat brake out: so that he wened to dye
straght way: yea I my self judged him dead also. But as soon as I took an
ounce of wine / and a dram (or the fourth part of an ounce) of Castoreum /
warmed and mixte together / and gave him it / by and by was the wamblinge
alayed.

Of like wise have I seen a boy of eight years / eat the paringes of white
^isinge powder / that were pilled from the root by a Potekary / and when the
child was brought to me / not knowing what had happened / I advised by my
self / that the child had eaten Lingwort. For the sweat brake fearcely out /
and it waxed pale / as if it would dye. Wherefore I gave him Castoreum / the
bigness of a filbert with a little warm wine / and continently was it hole /
which was even at the point of death.

A strange Apotekary bad my servant smell in a sagge / wherein was beaten
Lingworte or nising powder: and when he smelled therein / he thrust his head
into it / so that his mouth and nose were full of it. Then ran he up and
down in the house / as though he should have dyed. Wherefore I gave him
str^ight way fresh butter / and after that Castoreum with wine / (as is said
before) and he was healed incontinently. This have I written / that simple
folk may beware of Lingworte or white nising powder / with out it were proved
before / wherefore the commune people knows not. Like I my self have seen a
strange peddelapotecary minister to the commun people / that two or three dyed
of it. Therefore when one will use them / he ought not to take above the weight
of twintye wheat corns / with a whyt peas^lbroth. Howbeit for the Lingworte
may be taken the roots of Elder pilled / as is specifyed before.

To cause to perbreake without pain
Will thou cause one to perbreake lightely without smarte or pain / take the
sede of Orange / seth that in water without salt / and put a little oil of
nuttes thereto / and give him it with some course meat / and let him eat well
/ that the stomach may be full. After yt give him of the foresaid broth warm
a good draught: after that let him labor a little / or else walk / until he be
chafed / and then shall he perbreake and cast out whatsoeur evil corrupcion
he has in his stomach.

The coughe and the causes thereof.
For the cough.
Many ways gets a man the cough: sometime of the breasts mistemperinge /
sometime of a matter that is inward or outward of the body. If it be within /
as it happens often / that an humor falls out of the head into the breast /
the same is the worst to be healed. An humor in the breast


If the cough comes of heat / then is the brine read / and this throat is
dry and rough. To such one ought be given barley potage with butter to be
eaten / and Ptisana or Barley water to be droncken / wher^in Lycoris is sodden.
Give him also to eat potage made with Lettis chapped and sodden in water / and
after that well fried in butter / this takes away he cough without pain.

The cough that is engendered by cold / is known by the whytenesse of the
brine.

He that has a fervent cough / let him take Neppe / that cattes delight in / so
much as a Walnut / let him cut it small and stamp it / and ma^e a taunsey
thereof / with two eggs beaten therein: let him eat this / and it shall make
him whole. This taunsey may he eat when he will / and is specially good for
him that has a cough / caused of cold.

Or else use this medicine: take wine and oil of olive in like quantitye / put
the same into a cruyse / and seth it a little / stere it together / and give him
that to drink / when he will go to bed / and in the morninge / so warm as he
can suffer it: do this two days one after another / and this breaks the
running or morres / and softeneth the cough without hurt. It is also good for
horsenesse / caused of cold.

The cough does also overtake a man by reason of an evil humor engendered in
the liver or the lights / and so do fall into the breast: An humor in the liver
the same must be helped of this wise as shall follow.

Sometime is the cough caused by foren or outward occassions as are smoke /
evil vapors / stinking airs / dust / cold drinks / or of drinkinge cold
when a man is chafed / or else when he drincketh / it falls into the wrong
throat. Outvvar de occasions.


The dry cough comes sometime / that ye patient has an unclean pulmen or
lights and throat / and of fylthy matter / yt is assembled about ye pulmon and
the gristels of ye pulmon in the cheste / and is waxe^ tough: Dry cough.
whereby it comes / yt a man can not cast it out / and gets sometime a
deadly aposteme. When it is now growe^ to an aposteme / then help him with
syropes / as I shall teach you here after to mollifye it. Take also diligent
head whence the apostemacion comes / yt thereafter ye may know how to cure
him / and let this following be the general cure.

Take a whit cloth / wet ye same in cold water / and strayn it well out again:
tha^ wind it well about yt patie^tes throat. Cure general of apostems in the
breast.
After yt take another warm cloth / and wind also threfold about ye throat:
this do in ye morning / middaye / and at night / and give him this syrop: Take
a dishfull of brayded or beaten barlye / four ounces of res^nes / and xij.
figs well washe^ in warm water: put the^ into a new pot / and take iiij.
quartes of water / let the^ seth half an hour. The^ strayn this / and put the
drink again into the pot / and cast into it six ounces of sugar / let it
boil ones / then take it of and stand to cool. Drink of this when ye will /
specially in ye morning and even to bedward. This moll fieth very well / and
causes to cast out / and makes large about the breast: also does it heal ye
soreness and roughness of the throat. If it waxes thick / then put more
water to it.

A drink for the cough / for thyrste and roughness of the throat.
TAke a quarte of water / put an ounce of sugar therein / and seth the third
part of it away / strain it through and cloth / and let it cool / and drink
of it so much thou listest. It is good also to wash thy mouth in the morninge
and at none with warm water / and to rub thy teth: also to wash the forhead
and temples with warm water / this cleanses and makes the head light.

An other syrop for the cough and apostemacion in the breast and heart / which
weakeneth and causes to cast out.
TAke Violettes a handful / six leaves of Hearts tongue / put them in a clean
cloth and in a pot / to this put a quarte and an half of water / seth it
until the third part be sodden away: then press it through a cloth into a
clean pot / put thereto four ounces and an half of sugar / steare it well
vnti^l the finger is all molten. Of this may thou drink when thou will.

If the cough comes of heat / then is the throat sore / and very dry / and
the patient is very costyf. The cold air does him good / when he goes in it:
for he thinks that his heart is refreshed and quickened. Thissame ought to be
let blood in the Epatica or liver vain.

But if it is not conueniente to let the same blood / then mark whether his
cough be caused by a hot humor / and to what part it flows / and on that
part shall ye set boxes / for that is good.

For the hot cough.
Give him to drink syrope of Violettes / to bedwarde / at night / in the
morning / and else when ye will / with a little blood warm water. The Same
cools / mollisieth and causes to cast out: it slaketh thy^st / breaks
apostemacion / minisheth the cough / and comfort the dry and hot heart.

But when a man did cough / and were straight about the breast and heart / and
had heat therewyth / so that it were taken for an apostemacion.
Taken a dishe full of Hemp sede / put thereto a little warm water / braye it
well / and strain it with warm water / so that it become as a thyn parage.
After that when it is cold / give the patient thereof to drink so much as he
lists without hurt: the same does mollifye and cool very well / slaketh
thyrste / and makes large about the heart. And it is hood to seth that
hempsede milk with butter / suppe there of with a spoune as hot as ye can
suffer it / and in three days ye shall be whole without hurt or pain. It is
good also for stich about the heart.

But he that has a consuming cough / and were greatly trauayled therwyth / let
him eat at ones half a ounce of sugar Benedicti. A consumynge cough.
Then let him take three hoopes of a vessel / the one always greater then the
other / and hang over them a couerled or tent cloth / tied to the roof or
plancher / in the form of a bell dounwarde / and above narrow / reachinge
within a foot to the ground. Under the same set a stool with a hole / but
sitting upon the same / he may not reach with his head to the chain or
festeninge. Then take Malowes / Oerstrawe of each a great handful / and as
much of herb Valeriane / seth the same in a kettel well covered. After that put
them into two robbes / and put the one under the stool with a hole / into the
other set thy fete as hot as thou can suffer it / and let the vapor strike
up into the and upon the naked body / until thou be fallen into a sweat. If
the tobbe under the stole does cast no more vapor / then lay a hot flintstone
therein / so often till thou be fallen in a sweat: and this ought to be done in
a warm chamber / or hot house. Ye must not trauayl your self to much / lest
ye wax to feeble: and also if ye be fat / like ye have a siege before ye
attempt this dry bath. When ye now do sweat well / then lay you down upon a
bed in ye chamber or hot house: and if ye have yet strength to sweat more /
do so / for it is very good: for it weakeneth the hard matter / and makes
easy to be cast out / whereof the cough is engendered. After the bath must ye
not go in the wind / and remain that night in the hot house / or some close
chamber / and should eat some thing that gives strength / and drink good
drinks: the meat must be such as nourishes well / as are Oetmel gruel /
Persely ro^es / and such like. This shall ye do three days one after another /
and ye cough shall be mollifyed without grefe: and if he had a running in his
head / whereby the congeled matter might be hindered to lose and break / this
shall break it / and void it. Take also often in thy mouth the root of the
herb called Pelitory of Spain or Mustarde sede / chawe them / but swalowe
the^ not: that draws much corruption down. If the patient is strong of
complexion / than put a little Nisinge powder into his nose / to draw down the
evil humors / and beware of cold.

He ought also hold his mouth often over a pott / wherein are sodden Rapes or
Nauets / that the hot breath or vapor may go into his mouth / until his face
wax reed / and he do sweat: and let him keep himself warm thereupon. Thus may
he do likewise over a pott / wherein Appels or Pears are sodden with wine / Ale
or Bire.

Item if ye will be rid of the running / take ix. matches made of brimstone /
put them into a pot stopped close / save a little hole / make the^ to burn /
hang a clock or some thing upon thy head / open thy mouth wide open over the
pott / and receive that breath or vapor into it: this do in the morning and
evening / and the running shall break or fayde.

This following is very good for the cough coming from the lights.
Against the cough caused of diseased lights.
Eat a potage made of wheat / water and butter: or else take a dishefull of
pure and clean wheat / seth the same in two quartes of wat^r / until the third
part be sodden in. The Same broth is good dronken for the cough / for it
cleanses the pulme or lights / and the pypes of the same / whereof the cough
comes.

A cough with gripynge.
He yt has the greping in his body with the cough / or else should get an
apostemacion with the cough / let him take iiij. ounces of a black shepes wol /
put ye same as warm upon his body / as he ca^ suffer it / ii^. times in yt day
/ in ye morning / at none and to bedward. That mollifieth yt matter / whereof ye
cough is engendered / so yt he may void it / and takes away the grypinge and
cough.

Cough of humors.
But if ye cough did come of humors / desce^ding from the head or other me^bres
into ye breast or stomach / the^ give him this drink: Take honey the quantity of
an egg / beat the same with warm water / drink it as warm as you can / in
the morning and at even: that alayeth the humors. Ye must beware ye have good
sieges / lest ye get a greping thereby.

Another drink for the cough / that cools and mollifieth very well / and
specially apostemes.
A drink for the cough.
TAke Hempsede well beaten / mixte with water / and strayned through a cloth /
so that it wax even as milk / drink thereof in the night and toward night when
ye are thyrstye.

Or else take Rapes or Nauettes as much as a fyst / roste the same well in ashes
/ yt they become as weke as a pere / ye reader they be / ye better are they: it
greueth not though they be burnt somewhat. The Same shall ye eat when ye go to
bed / as warm as ye can suffer it / and likewise in the morninge. This is
good also for horsenesse.

The rote of Iris or blewe flower delyce sodden in wine / and drunk in the
morning and at night / takes away the costifnesse / and makes large in ye
breast.

He yt cougheth / ought often keep his breath in / so long as he can: and if yt do
not help him / then let him daily blow ye fire with his mouth / and he waxes
whole: if yt do not help also / then let him eat roasted figs / whereon is
strowed ye powder of Nep or Catmint called in Latin Calamentu^. But some use
no more save four or five Pepper corns / and chawe them / that takes away
the cough.

Of disease of the heart.
Hearts disease.
CArdiaca is a disease of trembling of the heart / when it trembles / leapeth
and beats / by reason of the humors / that are gathered within the celles or
felles that enuiron the heart: and this ouertaketh the patiente suddenly / when
the humors fall to near the heart.

If the humors are mixte with blood or colera / that causes over great heat /
then trembles the heart / and the patient waxes feeble / and thyrsteth very
sore / and draws his breath heauely.

If the humor be mixed with melancolike blood / then trembles the heart / and
the patient is werry / thyrsteth not / and is faint: wherefore ought ye heart be
helped furthwith / seeing it is the most noblest part of man.

If the hearts disease comes of colerik blood / which is hot and dry / then
must he be let blood in the lever: or else (without the season do hinder it)
give him a drink made of Cassia fistula / tempered with Borage water /
Buglosse water / and Medewort water / called in Latin Melissa.

But if the disease come of Melancolick blood / make him a siege with Diacartami
three quarters of an ounce in the morning / and let him walk well upon it. The
third day give him pills de iera picra seven in nombre to bedward: the same
cleanse the heart from fylth and noiaunce. It were good also to bath and sweat /
yet not to whote / lest he wax to feeble.

Sometime comes it of evil heat and moisture / and corrupt blood / and then
does he sweat sore. The same shall be let blood upon the left hand in ye vein
of the lights / and anoynte him with Paulinum / and oil of Violettes / and
give him sugar of Roses and light meats. Or else take a good tatt hen / yt has been killed ij. days before / yt she be tender: of the same seth a quarter very
well with water / in a pot well closed and stopped / yt no breath can come out of
it. Then take it out / and hold the quarter before the patientes mouth and nose
/ and the savor thereof shall comfort and strengthen him very well / and let
him drink a little of the broth. But if the patient has taken cold / then put
a little Cinnamon in ye water to seth with ye hen / for yt gives good warmth.
This pot often time ought to be putt in a stillitory / called Balneum Marie /
mixed with ashes / and well closed / and ought to seth three hours / or more /
until every water be consumed: and mark well when it is enough.

If a man has a stiche about the heart / if it comes of blood / or a hot
humor / or a fall or brusing / than give him to drink Endive water / Pimpenell
water / Moulbery water / or else Borage water. Stiche about the heart.
If ye have not the waters / then seth ye herbs with water / and drink it. Or
else take Borage ye herb / chap it small / and dight it like a thycke potage /
put butter therein and eat yt in the morning / yt is very good. Bugiosse is yet
a more sovereign herb to comfort the heart / dighted of this foresaid wise: but
ye Borage potage is good for ye stiche about the heart / specially if one makes
a potage thereof with the herb of Dasye / ye helps well / if a man were fallen
or wounded: for it drives away the evil blood / yt it avoid from him with a
siege. Also if a man have any grefe or heuines about the heart: the^ let him use
ye herb / flowers or root of Borage / or else the water distilled thereof or
sodden: for it comfort the heart very well / and makes a man merry.

Of hearts feblenesse or faintness.
THat comes thereby / when the fylth is so increased about it / that it can
not expel and cast it from it. Faintnes of heart.
This fylth is engendered by great surfeting and excess / specially in such /
as surfeit and labor not / whereby their stomak waxes so full / yt it can not
digest it. Or else if a man had eaten meat euel to digest / whereby the body is
filled with overmuch wind / and the heart febeled / whereof man gets many
diseases and inconveniences / as are scabbes / yushes or wheales / mattering
sores / karnels and the canker.

But if this filling or repletion is in the stomak / yt mark thereby: he
belketh or breketh much wind upward / or perbreaketh / and has pain in ye
head. Help the same of this wise: Purge him with a drink of powder of Seen /
give him in the eueninge a quarter of an ounce of powder of Seen / and in the
morninge as much / with a pease broth blood warm / and that shall cause him to
have a siege. The next day after / cause him to sweat in a bath / (if his
strength can suffer it) with these herbs: Take Valerian / Popular / Heysede and
Ootestraw of each a like / and give him to eat broth and potages with a little
saffron / that comfort the heart. If ye have no saffron / then take powder
of Buglosse / or else give him potage thereof to eat / or cause him to
perbreake / and tie his legs with little cords / thrust a squill dipped in
oil into his throat / to cause him perbreake. Or else cause him to perbreake with
Oken leaves / as I have taught you before. Or else give him ten pennye weight of
whyt nising powder / if he can suffer it: Howbeit I would not gladly co^sel it /
therefore beware always of nising powder / if you can forbear it.

The manners of voyding the body
It is to be noted / marked and known / ye great voyding and emptening of the
body is by sieges / by perbreaking / blething at the nose / sweat / flowers of
women / running sores / and by letting of blood / which is an abundant
emptyninge / and weakeneth the body / chaungyng a man his color / and quenchyng
his natural heat / whereof then must the heart needs wax faynte / as well as
of excess of fyllinge or surffetty.

Soudain alteracio^
A rash or soudayne alteration from heat into cold / stops ye sweat / and
encloseth the fylth within the body / whereby a man waxes faint and feeble. It
fortuneth also yt a ma^s heart waxes faint of soudayn joy / and yt happens
most to aged folk / whose nature co^sumeth. The heart also shrink together by
reason of excessive fear / heuinesse and mischange / or else by asto^nishment.
For great joy does the heart so open it self / that the natural heat faydeth
even away / and then waxes it cold and feeble / that men do sometime dye for
overmuch joy and gladness. Sometime waxes the heart faint / by reason of the
pain that other members have / for the pain strikes to ye heart / and
troubles the natural course the body and entrayles.

If now ye heart is faint by reason of great emptiness / then let his face be
cooled with water / pull him by the nose / and scratch him about ye holow or pit
of ye stomak. But if the emptiness be in the upper members / then bind the
nethermost members.

Nota for vvarmi^g and confortynge the heart.
It is to be noted / yt nothing is better for faintness of heart / the^ yt a
man put hole saffro^ in his drink / and put always a little in his broth or
potage: yt comfort the heart very well / and warmeth a man: likewise also
does Aqua vite / wherein is put hole saffro^ and then drunk. Or else take every
day about one or two of ye clock at after none an egg / and roast it / yt the
white there of wax a little hard: then take the yolke out of it / and put it
into a dishe alone / and pour a good ladel full of flesh broth / and put
beaten saffron therein / as much as though thou would salt an egg / put
thereto also a little salt / and drink it then out: that same is a great
comfortinge of the heart / and not only the heart / but also the whole body.

Voidnes in the nethermost me^bres.
But if the voydnesse or emptiness is in the nethermost members / then tie his
upper members.

And if his head do ache so sore thereof / that he thinks to be raging thereby /
then help him of this wise: Bath him softelye / and he shall lyghtely sweat.
And if he has heat in the head / then make him this: Take an ounce of oil of
Roses / vineagre half an ounce / beat the^ well together / struck this often
about his head / this alayeth the heat and ragynge of ye head. Give him
pills de iera picra / and set his foot often in warm water / and rub them
dounward. And when he takes them out / then let him rynsch them in cold water
/ and lay him down and rest: but let him have the soles of his fete vncouerd
/ that the euel humors and heat may draw dounwarde toward the fete. Give him
to eat meats confortatiue: howbeit not to much at once / until he have
recovered strength. If he be a man / he must beware of women: for that should
hurt him.

If ye feblenesse is come of heat or of vapor / help the same of this wise:
Faintnes of heat.
Keep him from anger or whote meats and from wine / without it be very well
alayed / and give him this following: Take the karnels of the Pomgranate / and
as much Barley meel / mix the same together / and make a potage thereof / let
him eat that. This cools the heart / and conforteth it: it is also good for
the stomach that is ouerchafed. But if ye can not have Pomegranates / than take
in stead thereof Berberis.

If the faynenesse comes by trouble and cold / the^ give him such things as
warm him / and bath him in warm water / to warm him naturally / and let him
drink good wine. Faintnes by trouble and cold.
Take also Saffron / Cinnamon / Clowes / of each a quarter of an ounce / Sugar
two ounces / Aqua vite half an ounce / water of Buglosse an ounce / white wine a
quarter of an ounce / put these together in a glass / and let them stand a day
and a night. After that drink three morninges thereof fasting / that chafeth
and warmeth the stomach / and comfort the patient. And in his meat ought he
to put of the foresaid spices / and keep him self warm / and beware of such
things as cool.

Of all accidents and diseases of the stomach / and how it may be healed.
When the stomach is full / and can not digest / it is to be marcked / whether
the matter indigested comes of superfluous eatinge and drinkinge: Of the
accidences and diseases of the stomach. Tokens of the evil digestion in the
stomach.
for that weakeneth the stomach and his natural operacion. And these are the
tokens / whereby it is known / whether the disease comes thereof: the vapors
come out of the stomach / and clim up into the head: or else is his mouth bitter
/ and he is thyrsty / and has great pain in his eyes. Sometime comes the
disease by unmeasurable and inordinate eatinge of cold meets / and thereby is
the natural operation of the stomach altered and weakened: and in the bottom
of the stomach engendre evil humores / causinge that man can not digest. And
these are ye signs whereby this is known: the urine is white / thick and
pale: above and in the midde is it clear / and in the bottom is it white as
whey of milcke / synckinge and cleninge to the bottom as it were corrupt
matter. The patiente has great pain in the kidneys and backbone toward the
left side. He has also great cold in his brains / which comes thereby /
that the stomak and brains be far asunder / and the vapors draw up out of
the stomach into the head / and thereby is the cold of the brains augmented.

If the stomach were full of evil humors / that are hot / and were engedred
of such hot meats / as are Garleke / Ouyons / Mustard / Pepper / and such
like / then are these the tokens of it: The paciente has great pain in the
head / he has great heat in the lever / which is by reason of the hot
meats that he has eaten: for they inflamme the lever / and consume her
moisture. And if the paciente is of Sanguine or read Colera complexion / and
eat such hot meats / then gets he feruente heat / and burns like
fire: he consumes his natural heat / and gets an unnatural heat in all
his body / and at the last gets he a feruente ague / called stinkinge febres
/ by reason the natural heat and the natural moystnes which manteyn the body
/ are consumed.

If the patiente is sick of the heat / then must he beware of all manner of
hot meats / and that he eat not much at ones / nor surfeit. Hypocrates
says: Like to like / mistempereth the body: and therefore ought cold
meats be given him / that is hot: and contrarywyse hoate meats to him that
is cold / to set the body again in a frame. Therefore also is it
conueniente to give the patient light meats of digestion / and cold / to
restrain the heat of the blood and the read Colera.

And if the disease were of flegma or black colera / or else of surffeting /
the^ must he be helped of this wise: He ought not to eat nor drink much /
but his meats ought to be such / as warm and comfort the stomak. He ought
also to eat co^fectes of quinches / made with quinches / sugar / or cheries /
or with sugar and appels: the same augment and restore again natural moisture.

Item when a man has his stomach full of superfluous hot moisture / of
sa^guin or read Colera complexion: then must the evil humors be digested and
prepared with any of these drinckes / which ye can best get. Take Barlye
half a pound / three quartes of water / and seth them to the fourth part /
then strain it / and put therein the roots of Succorye two ounces / Fenel
roots an ounce / Maiden heir / Endyue of each an ounce / the herb Buglosse /
the herb Borage of each half an ounce: pour over this the foresaid Barley
water / and seth the fourth part away / and then strain it again / put an
ounce or an ounce and an half of sugar to it / and give the patient to drink of
it in the morning and evening. And when the matter begins to be ready /
then purge the stomach of this wise: Take electuarium de succo Rosarum three
quarters of an ounce / a quarter of an ounce Diaprunis laxatiui / Cassie fistule
extracte half an ounce / Honey of roses half an ounce / water of Buglosse /
Borage and Endive of each three quarters of an ounce. Mix all this together /
and give ye patient the one half at evening / and the other in the morning in
the dawning / let him walk upon this / and not lie down again until nine or
ten of the clock: for as soon as the hot moisture is prepared and digested /
then is she easy to be cast out / and wyded. And if the patient sweat much /
then is it to be marked / that the body is full of superfluous humors: and
with digestyng of the humors / according to man's complexion / is he cured and
made whole: and this aforemencioned drink and purgacion is the digestion and
auoydinge of such fylth. After that ought some conserues and Electuaries be
ministered to him.

The stomach does sometime wa^bel and is quasy by reason of a heat / that is
engendered by undigested meats / or vnwholsom meats / and the vapor thereof
beats up into the head. The Same disease happens sometime of raw humors in
the stomach / and if ye take the patient by the body / then is it outwardly
weak / and yet feeble. Give to the same in the morninge half an ounce of
Diacarthami / or else give him half an ounce of Electuarij de succo rosarum:
the same cleanses the rough moisture out of the stomak.

But if the stomak does wamble of Melancoly / then is his body hard and dry /
when a man grypeth thereon. He that has that disease / ought to anoint the
body with oil of olive / wherein are sodden Fenkel sede or Kumin.

If a man had some evil matter / upon the mouth of the stomak / which he
would gladly vomit out: or else did perceive / he had much slymy fylth within
him / and would feign be rid thereof by perbreakinge: or that his stomak did
wamble: let him take grene Oken leaf in his mouth / and chawe it. If ye can
have no grene leaf / then take a dry or seer oken leaf / and lay it in
water / and then put it into thy mouth. Do this twice / thryse or four times /
and it shall draw much slyme and fylth. And if he has any matter within him /
then does he cast it out by perbreakinge. Or else take a little springinge water
/ and vinegre of like quantity / and drink thereof as much as an egg
conteyneth.

If a man had gotten vnlustynesse / that he had no appetite to meat / and
waxes heavy and faint / nether can tell whereby it comes / nor yet has great
heat: To avoid quasinesse and evil appetite.
then is nothing better for him / then that he take three hens eggs in the
morning / and let them be through warmed. After yt let him break them up / and
take away the white thereof / and suppe out the yolks / and drink thereupon a
good draughte of wine / and fast thereon until the eueninge / and walk
sometime: yt consumes the evil humors / which cause vnlustinesse.

But if he had gotten this vnlustinesse after meat / then let him eat no more
after that until the even / and then let him eat a thynne pappe of oetmeel
/ made with wine / and let him drink little / for that is good. And when he
will go to bed / then let his fete be rubbed with vinegre / wherein is sodden
Wormwod: this will happily cast him in a sweat / that were very good.

If the vnlustinesse comes by aduersitye and heuinesse / then is he holy
dismade and heavy / and all what he does / that greueth him. The Same must be
cured of this wise: Let him resort often where mirth is used / and eat meats
good of digestion / and in all his meats let a little saffron be put: for
that comfort the heart / but it causes vnluste in the stomach / therefore
ought but a little be put therein / yet causes it good blood / and rejoices
the heart.

He that has an unmeasurable lust to meat or drink / the same has also
sometime unmeasurable sieges: Gredynesse to meat and drink.
for the meat goes often from him not well digested / seeing the stomach needs
not overmuch meat / to digest well / and that it leave not at the last evil
humors. The Same ought to drink good read wine / and eat meats that do not
ouerchafe the stomach.

They that have many cold humors in their stomach / let the same eat fasting
raw onyons with salt and course bread. Cold humors in the stomach.
Garlike does also consume superfluous humors in the stomach / and helps it
to digeste: wherefore it is good for laborers / that drink much water / and
eat cold meats: it drives away also the dropsey.

But if the stomach had overmuch slymy humors in it / then ought it he losed
with D^acartami / or pills of iera picra. But if it has overmuch heat then
purge it with Electuarium de sucro rosarum / in the morninge / with a
peasebreth. And after two or three hours give him yet peasebroth that is not
salted nor sauoured / and let him walk / and not lie down if he have so much
strength. Ye may also eat grene ginger against a slymy stomach / the same
warmeth it / and makes digestion. Or else make a potage of young Nettels /
the same warmeth the stomach / and consumes evil humors in it / and causes
good digestion. Grene Calmus does likewise eaten in the morning and evening /
and purges the stomach.

But if it is in winter / then eat in the morning and eueninge Anis sede upon
bread / dipped in wine / the same cleanses the stomak from slyme / and makes
good digestion. S. Ihons beries called in Latin Berberis / slake thyrste /
specially that comes of Colera or the gal / and stop the flixe / and make
appetite to eat and drink: they be good for the quauering heart / refrain
vomitinge / and are good eaten against blusters or reed pustuls / against the
pestilence / specially when they are ripe / stamped and strayned through a
cloth / and sodden to the thycknesse of a pappe: keep this through the whole
year / and take thereof a Walnut shell full at ones.

When a man can not sweat / or else sweateth ouermuche / how that may be
caused / or refrayned.
Of svveatinge.
SOme men sweat much / and when they sweat not / then are they evil disposed /
and find none other grefe nor disease anoynge the^. This sweat must be
wythstande / or else makes it the members feable / and dries him without his
knowledge. He that does so sweat / be sure that it is a token that he is full
of evil humors / wherwyth he is chafed and warmed / that he must needs sweat.
Cure.
The Same ought to be cured of this wise: he must be purged / after that ye
perceive his complexion: and when he is in purgynge / make him a bath / to
draw forth such humors of th^s wise:

Take a pound of Gentiane roots / slyce them as small as grotes / put them
into a little bag / put thereto two ounces of salt / and eight quartes of water
/ and let the Gentian be well sodden: and if thou nedest more water / take more
of the first water. In this bathe let him bath six hours in the morning
fresh and fasting / or according as he can suffer it. And if he would gladly
eat or drink / let him boldly eat a suppe / and drink ones / to make him
strong. When he has now bathed enough / then let him lie down to bed / and
rest or sleep well: and if a sweat came upon him / without procuringe / that
were very good for him / and that he might even so rest or sleep a little. Then
let him eat that / whereto his mind stands best / whether it be Chekens or
Pollets sodden or roasted / Ryss potage and other good potages. He must be sober
in eatinge and drinkinge / lest he take a surffet / and the stomach be stopped
/ whereof is caused a lothsomnesse to his meat / and consequently the yalow
iayndes or other disease / for the which he needs not to bath any more.

Of sweating.
ONe manner of sweat is natural / the other unnatural. Two manner of svveates
natural and unnatural.
The natural sweat comes by it self / so that a man sweateth over all his
body / and se that his nethermost parts are warm / and that his sweat is
warm / and that man waxes not faynte of it / ye he rests better after it /
and is lyghter than before. This is a token / that that man has many humors
with in him / and that his nature is so strong / that it can expel and drive
out the same humors / and therefore is sweatinge for such one. They are also
natural sweates / when a man goes in hot houses that are not over whore /
and that man does than begin to sweat: or else when one batheth in waters
that are not over hot / and that he begins then to sweat about the head
and eyes. This ought not to be refrayned / for it is wholesome. Or else is it a
natural sweat / when a man labors measurably / and is not so sore chafed
therewyth. All these are good and wholesome / for they drive away from man the
superfluous humors.

The unnatural or evil sweat is it / that comes toward the evening / and
is cold / and waltereth only about the heart. The Same though it be not good /
yet is it not so greatly to be wythstande. But when a man has a great
disease or feblenesse / and a cold sweat breaks out only about the nose
/ that is a very deadlye sign / specially when the nosethrilles open and close
fearcely / and the nose waxes sharp. Tokens of death.


But when he sweateth only about the heart / that is sometime a token that a
man is very contrary to his nature / and that the heat is inward in his
body / and nature out of frame / and the pories (which are the issues of the
sweat) stopped / whereby nature is not strong enough to drive out the sweat
through the skin. Beside this are those natural sweates / when men sweat
much every day: and that comes thereby / that men have ouermuche moystnesse
or humors within the^ / and that must be abated then and let.

These things cause to sweat without danger: The flowers and herb of
Camomille / or else Malowes / put them into a close tobbe / and make a bath so
/ that the vapor may stryke up into the. Things causyng to sweat
And such a bath is good for them / that will not gladlye wet their fete. Like
virtue also has Fenell / Penyreal / the flowers of Hoppes / Branck vrsyne the
toppets of the flower / Saluye or Sage with the flower / Smalage / and wild
Clarye / called otherwise Oculus Christi.

A good bathe for them that have taken cold.
Of this wise ought they be bathed dry / which have taken cold / before
they do bath in water: Take Mugworte / Sauge / Fenel / Penyreal / of each a
hand full / chappe them small / and put them into two bags / seth them well /
also make a sweating therewyth when ye will bath. And when ye will bath / then
wet a long cloth in cold lie / wringe it well out / and tie it about thy
head. Then put the water that the herbs have been sodden in / into a to^ / and
set thy fete therein / as hot as ye can suffer it / and lay one of the bags
under you / and sit thereon / and lay the other upon your stomach /
retchynge down till your priuye members: but look ye bathe not to hot.

Flowers causyng to sweat
These flowers cause sweatinge also: The flowers of Almondes / Cheris / Violets
/ Langedbeiff / White poppy / White lyllyes / Benes / Cocles / great Malowes /
or Holy hockes / Filbertes / Blewlyllyes / or Appels. Of these flowers may ye
seth some in water / to make a sweatinge bath / or else seth them in a bag /
and press it well out / and lay it as hot upon your body as ye can suffer
it / and tie an other bag about thy fete / for that shall cause you to
sweat so much the sooner and without hurt.

Svveati^g herbs hot of co^plexio^
These herbs following are of warm complexion / and cause him that is cold of
complexion to sweat lightely: Take Penyreal / Lauender flowers / Mustarde
flowers / Cousloppes / Sauge / Mugwort / the flowers of Elecampane / the leaves
of Lorel or Baye / Selandine or the flowers of it / and Fitches: all these / or
part of them may ye seth in half water half wine / and may provoke sweat
therewyth / as is said.

Herbs causinge to sweat lightely.
These herbs cause to sweat lyghtely: Malowes / Holyhockes / Brankvrsine /
Hounds tongue / the rotes of white lillies / Longeworte growing by Okentrees /
Louage / Pelitory of the wall / Millefoyle / the herb of Violettes / Lettis
and the flowers of Hathorne.

To svvet easily.
This following causes to sweat easily / another needs a man to be covered
therefore the more: Take the leaves and flowers of Elder tree / the leaves of
Lilies / of each two handful / put the same under the patientes shites / and
let him lie upon his back upon the herbs / if he fall a sleep there on / he
shall sweat.

An ointmente to cause to sweat.
This following causes to sweat also: Seth Nettels in oil of nuttes / anoint
him well therewyth at night / that it may strike in through ye skin / and
after his sleep toward the morning shall he fall in a sweat. Also if a man
takes Rue or herb grace / Salt and vinegre / and rub the patients hands
inwardly / and the soles of his fete / when he will go to bed / in the morninge
after his sleep shall he fall to sweatinge.

This also causes to sweat: Take a white and hard dogs dounge / braye and
syft the same through a cloth / of that take as much as a Filberts shell can
conteyne / put to the same as much Oetmeel as two eggs can hold / and a
dish full of Vinegre / and four times as much water: make of this a thynne
broth / and give it the patient to suppe to bedwarde / and he shall sweat
continently: and that sweating is sovereign good for them that have fervent
heat / as in a pestilence or fervent ague.

A bath to make fruitful.
If ye will make a good natural bath / that chafeth and warmeth well / and
warmeth also baren women / that they become fruytefull: Take three quartes of
the roots of Sloes / or six good handfulles / cut them small / and seth them
until the water waxes read: put thereto a pound of Alume / and half a
pound of Brimstone beaten to powder / but let these be put or tied in a
cloth.

Ye must know also / that if a woman were sore cold / then take twyse as
many roots / nether must any other water be put thereto / then the same
that is sodden with the three forsayde things. It is good also to put three
hand full of salt into the kettel where they are boiled. And she must beware
of taking cold / and use meats that warm.

If the man be cold of complexion / then must he bath therein also / for the
woman becomes so much the more fruytefull: for when a man batheth with a
baren woman / they wax so much the more abler / and she the more fruytefull.
It were good to take the foresaid roots of Slo^s / as much grene flax with
the roots chapped small / and bound together in a bag / and than lay that
bag behind upon the womannis back / as warm as she can suffer it: and when
the bag waxes cold / to warm it again in the forsayde water / and lay it
again to her body in the bath. This must be done often / for there with is
her matrice or mother chafed / and made apt to conceive and be fruytefull.

How a man may be restored again that has lost his strength by sycknesse.
IF a man were become very weak and feable by reason of a long sycknesse /
even that he seems to be consumed / A restoringe of man's natural strength
nether can recover / then take twentye old cocks / dress and dighte them as
though they should be eaten / seth them in the third part of a tonne of
water / stamp them in a mortar / so that the bones be al to bruised and make a
bath therewyth / and let him bathe therein. When he has bathed enough / lay
him to bed / and rest.

Or else bath him in Fern or brake / for that restores ye senowes to their
former strength / and comfort the patient. The Fern ought to be chapped
small / and put into a bag / and to a mean basket full / must ye take the
third part of a tonne of water.

This bath following is good for them that have been long sick / or whose mary
in the bones is corrupt / or else their blood in the veins is corrupt and
become naught / by reason of cold: Another restori^ge bath.
for it is a strong bath / and is the bath of Master William of Vallis.

Take Sauge / Rue / Wormwoode / Betonye / Reed mynte / the roots of Nettels /
Wild Mergerum / Mugworte / the herb of Strawberryes / the sede of Nettels /
Louage / Juniper / whereon are many berryes or corns / of each a hand full.
Chappe all these small / and put them in two bags / put to them half a pound
of Bayeberyes / and a pound of beaten Brimstone / part them (I say) into two
bags / and seth them well in water / as much as is convenient / and bath
three days therein / nether put any more water thereto / and bath in the
morninge fasting / so long as ye can endure it. After that sees the other
bag also / and do as before: the same strengtheth the lymmes / and gives them
force.

A good drink that strengtheth the heart and all the members / if a man drink
half an eggs shale full in the morninge and eueninge / with as much good
wine.
A drink to strengthen a man.
TAke the best Aqua vite that ye can get / take also a piece of fine gold /
make it gloynge whote ix. times / and quench it again / the more ye quench
it / the stronger waxes the water and better / put into the same Aqua vite half
a quarter of an ounce of saffro^ / and a quarter of an ounce of Cinnamon both
beaten / let them stand four days well stopped / and steare it every day ones
/ but when thou will take it / then let it stand still vnstered / that it may
be clear. This water warmeth the cold stomach / gives strength to all the
members / specially to aged folk / that have been ouerlonge sick / whose
strength is consumed: for it comforts and strengtheth the heart out of measur.

Another drink comfortinge the body and purginge.
A drink co^forti^g the body
TAke two ounces of Aqua vite / nisynge powder a quarter of an ounce / let them
stand fourten days. After that press it out through a fylte / and take
thereof evermore fasting a quarter of an ounce with an ounce of wine.

But if ye will refreshe the body / then take a quarter of an ounce of iera
picra / and lay it in Aqua vite as before / and drink thereof fasting three
drops / and take a little in your hand / and put and rub it into your nose
/ and draw the sent there of up into your head. The water of Buglosse dronken
/ is good for them that be sick at the heart / or else the water stilled with
an old hen / the same give him to drink that has lain long sick / and is
feeble: for it gives him good strength / and it must be taken in the morning
and eueninge.

These meats strengthen well the forsayde diseased / namely / Hearts fete /
Does fete / Bulls fete / or any ruder beasts fete. The elder these beasts be
/ the more do they strengthen / and they must be sodden so long / till the
bones fall from the flesh / and strowe beaten Saffron upon them.

Item a good bath and natural / for it draws forth evil heat / and
strengthens well.
A bath to dravv out evil heat and to strengthen.
TAke Heeth or Lynge / Penyreal / Wormwood / Sauge / Fenel / of each a handful
/ put it into a bag / and lay it into a kettel that it may be through hot.
And when ye bathe / than sit upon the bag: howbeit ye need not to put it
again into the kettel / for the water should wax to strong.

A very wholesome confection to strengthen a diseased of the foresaid sycknesse.
TAke the best Grapes that ye can get / put them into a kettel / stamp them
/ and make wine of them: A confection to stre^gthe^.
seth that well about an hour / steare it / and strain it through a copper
strayner / after that strain it through a fyner strayner / and seth it again
/ that it wax as thycke as a thyck pappe / and steare it till it be cold /
cut it than to small pieces / and put it into a pot that is glased / and
then is it made ready. The staler it is / the better is it / and may be eaten
what time a man will.

Kowe mylcke and Rice sodden together / strengthens very well / or else a
thycke potage made of grene Persely and flesh / or else with Perselye and a
good Hens broth: the same strengthen very well: Meats stre^gtheninge.
Likewise does the mary of Hertes / Roes or rudder beasts / drawn out of the
bones / sodden and eaten.

If a man were wholly febled and abated / and could take no manner of
sustenaunce / it were good for him to drink warm woman milk / or else to
suck a woman / specially in the morninge: Another to strengthen.
the same does strengthen and comfort the heart very sore and all the members /
and causes good blood: But if he could eat flesh dighted with the flowers of
Borage / that were a sovereign thing.

Or else take an old Hen / let her be dressed as is convenient / put her
into a pottel pot of tynne well closed or stopped / put a goblet of wine
thereto / and half a quarter of an ounce of beaten Saffron well beaten and
steared with the wine: set the pottel pot in a kettel with water / and lay a
stone or some weyghte upon the pottel pottes lydde / and let it seth two hours
continuallye. Then look whether the hen be fallen a sunder / for then is it
enough: if not / let it seth better. This sauoureth very well / and gives
great strength. If the hen be little / put so much the less wine and
Saffron to it.

If any man has lain long sick / whereby he is waxen cold / let him take a
hand full of Buglosse / and seth it well in a quarte of wine / strain that
juice through a cloth / and drink thereof in the morning and evening:
the same gives natural warmth / and comfort the heart very well.

He that has his legs cold by reason of long sycknesse or age / let him
take halffe a bushel of Ootes / and sees that well with two quartes of water /
and one quarte of wine / till it be halffe consumed / and wax brown in the
kettel / steare it well / lest it burn. A Stoui^g or bathi^g of cold legs.
Put this into a soft sack or pilow bier / half an elle long and broad /
and wrappe his legs and fete therein / as warm as he can suffer it: do this
in the morninge and eueninge and none: of this wise may he be chafed again in
three days / and without danger.

Of all accidents of the Liver.
MAny diseases come from the Liver / as Stopping / Rottinge / Diseases caused
by the liver.
Inflammation / the Yalow iaundis / the Dropsy comes also there by / that the
Liver can not digest / and that blood that she should send into the members /
is turned to water: the members are out of their frame / and have no due
operacion / by reason of the Lyuers disease / that is / that the veins
coming from the liver to the stomach / do give evil heat: The Same heat
dries or seereth the stomach / so that he gets lust to drink cold water
/ and that causes the stomach to digest evil / and causes dropsey. For the
lust of cold water / weakeneth the digestion wholye / and the blood that the
liver should send to the vrines / is mixte with cold water / by reason of the
indigestion / and so is parted through out all the members / and thereof swells
man / and gets the dropsey.

Of the Spleen.
Otherwise comes this disease of the Spleen / that it can not digest the
substance / which the Liver has ministered and sent to him / and that is
Colera nigra: the same blood does mix it self farther into the other members
/ and thereof swells a man.

Of the kidneys.
Sometime is it occasyoned of the Kydneys / or that a man bledth to much at the
nose / or sometime that a man is to much bound in his bellye / and can have no
sieges.

Sometime of superfluous blood / which lies hardened and undigested in the
liver / the same does mix it self into all the members / and causes them to
swell.

Remedy for the liver.
He that is diseased in the Liver / help him of this wise: Let him beware of
all meats chafynge or whote of complexion: for chafynge meats to scaulde the
liver / and bring it out of his complexion. Wherefore it is requisyte to set
the Liver again into his former digestive power / with medicines competente to
it: that is / that she be purged of Colera / Blood / and black Colera. A
confection to mollifye diseases.
It is reason and requisyte in all diseases / to mollifye the disease / with
this syrop or confection / before a purgation be ministered to him.

Take the roots of Fenel / Percelye / of each a handful: the herb and roots
of Walworte and Valeriane / of each an ounce: the seeds of Fenel and Anis of
each half an ounce: water two or three quartes. Bruise the roots / and let them
all stand stypinge a night / and give the pacient to drink there of in the
morning and evening / at every time three ounces / mixte with water of the
flowers of Eldren or Boure tree / and after that purge him with Dia prunis
laxatiuo / an ounce at ones / and that should be ministered to him after his
first sleep / and he may sleep safely there upon.

Item to purge one easily / without danger / that has a hoate disease / in a
chafed Liver of a whote ague or other disease / give him in the morning half
an ounce of Electuarium de succo rosarum / three quarters of an ounce Cassie
fistule extracte / water of Endive / the water of Colander or Maidens heir /
of each an ounce and an half: mix them together / and give him it in the
morning / but he may not sleep there upon.

Give him for a confortatiue Diarrhodon abbatis.

Walwort dronken refrayneth the waterish moisture in the bellye.

Nothing is better in the world for the Dropsye / then to drink the juice
of Blewlillies roots an ounce or an half / with two ounces of whay: or else the
root sodden with wine / and droncke in the evening and morning / the same
enlarges the breast / and takes away fetching of the breath with pain /
wherwyth they that have the dropsy / are payned.

Of the yalow iaundis.
ICtericia is the yalow Iaundis / and alteracion of ye natural color of the
skin into a yalow color. Of the yalovve Iaundis and the causes thereof.
The Same comes sometime from the Liver / sometime from the Galle / sometime from
the Spleen. The iaundis coming from the Liver / is caused two ways: either by
mistemperatnesse of heat / or by stoppynge in the liver. The iaundis caused by
mistemperaunce of heat / is of two sorts: sometime with apostemacion / sometime
without apostemacion. But if the iaundis comes by a waysting with
apostemacion / then are the signs in a man strengthynge / trembling and a
pain in the right side / a consumpcion of the whole body / and minishynge of
the strength and the digestion / the water is as read as blood.

The iaundis without apostemacion has no consumpcion / streyngthynge / nor
trembling / and they have also the commune token of yalownesse in their eyes /
the face yalowe / pale or grene / the water read and bloodye.

First ought medicine to be given for the apostemacion / if the iaundis is
with an apostemacion / that it be first taken away / after that shall be taken
away the waystinge coming by the heat.

A true medicine for the Iaundis.
TAke a handful of Cherye leaves / sees them in a pint of milcke / that it
boil well / strain it / and drink a good draught thereof to beddewarde and
in the morning fasting / and the iaundis shall avoid from you by siege. Or
else drink in the morninge and euenyng this following: Take the wood of Berberis
/ pyll the upper shell with the leaves from it / and take the second shell
that is yelowe: put thereof as much as a walnut in a cloth / and seth it
with a pint of water / that it be well boiled / and let it cool / and then
drink it. This has been experimented / put thereof also in thy drink.

Against the desperate iaundis.
TAke two handful of the root of blewe Lilies / cut them small / and sees
them in three quartes of water four hours long: and when he will go to bed /
wett a fine shete therein / that it be well wett / fold it together / and
wind it all over and over the pacientes body / even the head also / when he
goes to bed. If he sweat / then draws the iaundis into the shete / and
waxes yalowe.

Him that the yalow iaundis takes / is well perceived by his eyes / hands /
soles of the fete / and the yalow color of the whole body.

Against the iaundis that is rooted.
TAke Celidony both the herb and root / chappe it small / and when ye have a
pottel thereof / sees it in water / and let it be well covered / that no vapor
may go out / and make therewyth a sweating bath / and if ye sweat well /
the iaundis shall avoid by it.

Another true and hurtlesse science for the iaundis.
TAke the sede of Ancolie or Accolie beaten to powder / a quarter of an ounce /
put thereto beaten saffron a penny weight / and an ounce of vinegre / and two
ounces of water of Celidony / steare them well together: the same should be
dronken fasting or to bedwarde / and drink not after it. The same drives out
the iaundis by the urine harmless. In the morning draughte put sugar /
that makes it good. It may also be mixte with as much Southisteen water / as
may be droncke at ones: or take the flower of Cichore and roots / and seth
them in half wine / half water / and drink thereof fasting / and at even.

Yet another medicine for the iaundis that is rooted / or else has infect the
eyes and skin.
TAke the herb of holes / burn it to ashes / and of them make a lie / and
wash thy therewyth: wet also a cloth therein / and wind it warm about thy
head to bedwarde: do this eight days continually / and the iaundis shall be
drawn into the cloth through the head.

Another true medicine for the iaundis.
BEat the carnels of Peaches small / put vinegre thereto / so much that it
wax a thynne broth / drink that what time ye will / and specially fasting /
or to bedwarde / but ye may not drink after it: that breaks the iaundis /
likewise do the carnels of wild Almondes.

Iaundis with cos^ifnesse.
If one had the iaundis / and were so bound in his belly / that he could have
no sieges / then make him this solutorye. Mark whether he have a heat / then
give him to bedwarde half an ounce of Viol syrop / with as much cold water /
and give him in the morning half an ounce of Electuarium de succo rosarum /
tempered with a warm Hens broth / or a broth of Calves flesh / or else a
broth of white Peasen / and let him drink a good draught after that.

But if the heat nor bitterness would go away / then give him fasting a
quarter of an ounce of Rebarbara / with an ounce and an half of water of
Moulberryes / and the next day let him blood in the Liver vein / and let him
beware of all meats that warm. Give him sometime warm water into his mouth /
to wash it there with / and afterward cold water / to rensche it: do this in
the morninge / and let him wesh his hands likewise. Or else let him drink
distilled water of Hertes tongue / or the herb sodden in water / the same is
good dronken against the iaundes / for the heat of the liver. Or else take the
powder of Ancolye sede / and beaten saffron / of each a penny weight / and half
an eggs shale full of wine / and as much water / and as much vinegre: mix
these v. together / and drink that to bedward / and in the morning fasting:
this helps very well / and is experimented.

A good powder for the iaundis.
TAke the skin of a Hens mawe / wash it fair with wine / dry it / and
make it to powder. A powder for the iaundis.
And when thou will rise from the board or supper / then suppe a piece of bread
in wine / and put of that powder thereon / and eat it to bedwarde / and in the
morninge fasting: this is a sovereign thing for the iaundis in the stomak.

Or else take earth worms so much as half a walnutt / cut them small / and
braye them with a little wine or water / so that ye may swalow it: drink the
same fasting / and hold a slyce of bread tosted with salt warm before thy
mouth / and drink Endive water thereupon: mix wine also and water of Endive
together / and drink that to bedward.

He that has the iaundis upon the tongue / or that his tongue were dry or hot
/ let him take Psyllium / that is to say Fleewort / as great as a Filbert /
let him put it in a fine cloth / and lay it in warm water three hours long:
after that let him struck his tongue therwyth otherwhyles / the same draws out
the evil heat / cools the tongue / and takes away the bitterness.
Likewise does Sauge laid in cold water / and lays always a fresh leaf
thereof on it. A Plantayne leaf laid in cold water / and so laid wett upon
the tongue / do likewise: for it cools the mouth / and takes away the
bitterness. But if it were winter / and ye could not have the herbs: then
take little flynte stones / lay them in water / and do as is said before.

He that has the iaundis so fervently and sore / that he can nether tayste nor
drink wine or good drink: let the same drink Barley water at all times / for
that alayeth the heat of the iaundis and gall / and nourishes well. And if he
can eat no meat / yet let him eat a pappe of Barley sodden with water and
butter / and let him use that / until he can eat other meat: and let him
drink also water of Lillies / or Isop / or Buglosse.

There is an herb called Herb of iaundis / it is so right grene as grass /
and has a long stalk / and long leaves / fashioned like Esula / save that
it has no milcke / as Esula does. Of this herb take a hand full / and a quart
of water / seth them well: of this water let the patient drink in the morning
and eueninge / and temper his drink therewyth: the same breaks and drives
away the iaundis sore without grefe / so that it is perceived in the urine. Or
else take the sede of Ancolye or Accolye the weight of twinty wheaten corns /
mixed with two eggs shalesfull wine / drink the same fasting in the morninge /
and as much to bedwarde: the same drives the iaundis strayghtwaye from you in
the urine.

If the iaundis were rotted in a man / and had therewyth heat / thyrste and a
stiche / then take his shyrte or smoke / and wett it in his oune urine or
chamberlye / wringe it well out / put it on him again / lay him again to
bed / and cover him warm: then draws the iaundis out into his shyrt or
smoke / and his skin and smoke shall be as yelowe as a quench: and this must he
do thryse. This may be done also / if the liver were inflamed.

It is good also for the iaundis / to struck the weast of the hands very well
with warm wine / in the morning / at none / and eueninge: for it draws the
iaundis from the stomach.

Of the diseases of the Liver. Of inflamacion of the Liver.
Infla^macio^ of the liver.
Sometime is the Liver diseased of his oune fault or vice: sometime also by other
members. When it is diseased of it self / that is sometime of heat or cold /
sometime of superfluous moisture / or else of dryenesse or droughte / where of
the liver and bladder get great hurt. When it is so diseased / then let the
patiente at the liver vein in the arm: or else let him blood in the small
toe of the right foot. But if he has eaten / then let him blood by the
little finger upon the hand / and give him to drink barley water. Let him eat
no flesh / nor chafynge or inflamynge meat / no salt meat / none old baken
bread / no eggs / nor none vndigestible meats.

A good powder for the hot liver / hot stomach and for the hot ague.
A powder for inward heat.
TAke five ounces of beaten or ground barlye / mixte with Endive water / put
thereto an ounce and an half beaten Coriander / stiped before in Vinegre / and
a quarter of an ounce of Anis sede beaten / four ounces of sugar: the same must
be eaten with bread / dipped in wine in the morninge fasting / after meat /
and to bedwarde: it causes also an appetite.

Ye may give him also ^onfect of Cheries in the morninge / and let him fast
thereon six hours. Give him Sorel juice to drink / the same cools / and
alayeth the heat of the liver and thyrste / or else give him water distelled of
Sorell / the same cools and alayeth the thyrste without danger.

When the Liver is inflamed.
Infla^macio^ of the liver and the remedy thereof.
When the liver is inflammed / take Oken leaves / make thereof square pyllous /
as great as a head / and lay one to the right side: and when the same waxes
hot / take it away / and lay an other that is fresh thereon. This may ye
do day and night / and that draws the evil heat out / cools the liver
naturally. Or else wett a cannefas in Endive water / wringe it out / and lay it
upon the liver. Eat also the Lyuerworte that grows in moystye marshes or
standinge waters / and drink of it. Ye must beware of anger and sorrow / and
when ye will eat or take of refection / then rub your tongue and tethe /
and after that wash them well with cold water. In the morning / none and
evening set your fete in warm water and warm them therein: after that put
them suddenly in cold water / and then lay you down with the soles of your
fete uncovered / for then draws the evil heat after the cold / and
comfort you.

He that has a diseased liver of a cold complexion can eat much better /
then he that is diseased of a warm complexion / and yet can not he digeste it.
He has great stiches in his right side / and his face changes sore: Mark
this.
his lips and tounges wax white / and he waxes pale under his eyes / his
blood minisheth / his urine is pale / clear or white / and a little scomminge.
It is good to purge the same with Rebarbara / and to anoynte his liver wi^h oil
of Nardus / and oil of Dyll / of like quantity. Or else give him to eat
raysins / and such meats as chafe him: but let him beware of sweet meats /
for they hurt the liver and spleen. Set his fete also in warm water /
wherein Camomille is sodden / let him warm them well therein / and beware for
taking cold: for that does hurt.

Wormwoode in meat comforts and warmeth the stomach and liver / and causes
lust to eat / it heals also the stoppinge of the liver / as in the yalowe
iaundis and dropsye. For this use may ye dry it / make it to powder / and
eat thereof in the morning / at none and at eueninge / at every time so much
as a chest nutt. Let him eat Rice potage / and Ciche peasen sodden / that
the ^uske be taken away. Let him also eat the broth of a pollet / wherein
white bread is stiped.

Sometime is the liver diseased of overmuch moystnes / the same does his Spleen
swel / and his urine waxes as white and clear as water / he has also pain in
his loins / and specially in the left side: Liver diseased of overmuch
moistness and the tokens of it.
he is not a thyrst / he is heavy minded / his stomach wambleth by reason of
stopping of his liver.

Sometime is the liver stopped by reason of dry blood / which can not flow
nor have course through the other veins / as it should do: because of his
grosnesse and thycknesse.

It is stopped also by other humore / that are gross and slymye / of the which
it has gotten their nature and qualitye.

Sometime is the liver stopped by reason any member has not his due course /
because it is cut of or mamed / and the blood passinge through the same from
the liver / is stopped / and so remains it in the liver. Those that be so
diseased / ought ye to purge with pills of Iera pi^ra / and let him blood in
ye liver vein in the arm: and after eight days / upon ye right hand between
the little finger and the next / and give him to eat meats that cool / and
drink small drinks. He ought also at the first to be let blood in the Median
in the arm / and give him to eat sugar of Roses.

Sometime is the liver of a woman stopped / when her flowers draw upward /
before it is due season.
SHe that is in such a case / that her liver is stopped / because her flowers
are stayed before time conueniente / the same ought to be let blood
continently at both the fete / and to purge her all manner of ways / as it
perteyneth women / whose flowers are stopped / as it is showed hereafter. Give
her pills of iera picra / the first night three / the second night five / the
third night seven: this is the best recept for them / for they purge her well.
And this should be ministered to them furthwyth: for if it be delayed / then is
it grievous to aid them / which nevertheless is easy at the first.

Of Apostemation of the Liver.
Apostematio^ of the liver
Sometime grows an aposteme in the Liver / by reason a man is fallen / beaten
or stricken upon it: sometime because a moisture is gathered in it: sometime of an
evil heat / that is gathered in the stomach of undigested meats.

The diseases or apostemes of the liver / are sometime upon it / and then rises
a swellinge upon the liver. But when the apostemacion is under the liver / then
gets a man great pain in the right side: and this is fa^the^ known thereby
/ that when he eats / he waxes cold / or else when he ^^^weth his breath /
that does grieve him between the shulders and liver.

If the apostemacion comes of heat / then has the patiente a sore ague and
great thyrste / and his tongue is at the first read / and afterward black:
and it that goes from him is first Colera / and becomes grene after that.

A good drink for the Liver / howsoever she is diseased.
Cure of the liver with dri^kes and otherwise.
TAke four roots of Cicory / but if they are great / take but twayn / wash
them clean / cut of the herb / seth them in a quarte of water / until the
third part be sodden in / or a little less. Let the same water cool / and
drink it fasting / howsoever ye will: yet not to much at ones: the same does
purge the liver / and heals also.

But if the disease is under the liver / then give him also pills of Iera
picra / and take heed / lest the apostemacion wax hard. If it waxes to hard
/ it can be remedyed with no medicine / for the dropsey follows it. Yet are
some things / where with it may be helped / that are / Liver wort and the
juice of Smalage / sodden in wine or water / if he has no great heat. If the
apostemacion is comme of heat / then give him to drink the juice of Fenel /
the juice of Smalage / oil of Almondes with Oxizacara. If the apostemacion is
come of a fall or brusynge / then give the patient a quarter of an ounce of
Rebarbara with milk.

He that has is liver fauty or unclean / let him take Santali wood / Endive
water and Cheruel water of each an ounce and an half / mix them together / and
part it in three portions / and drink thereof three morninges fasting / at each
time one portion / and he shall be whole / and it is experimented and proved.

Of diseases of the Lyghtes or Lunges.
OF evil and corrupt air / that a man has drawn into him / come diseases
into the Lights / and be so fervent / that a man dies thereof. Diseases of
the lyghtes or lunges.
For the lunge or lights lies upon the heart / and gives air to the heart:
and when the corrupt or venomous air comes to the heart / it infecteth it /
and causes otherwhyles the death of a man.

Somtymes also fortuneth a man to have an aposteme in the lights / whereof is
caused another to disease / called Asthma / when the breath is short / and that
by reason the condutes of the lights are stopped. Asthma.
Sometime also gets a man a disease in his lights or poulme / that he is
costumed to eat unnatural and unkind meats / as fruytes / sour and salt
meats.

Such diseased must be kept from all meats / that are not good of digestion /
and from sour or salt meats. Also from al manner of fruit / except raysynes
and plummes: for they cool and lose the belly. Let him absteyne from Pigeons
or Doves / and from all manner of foul that dwells in waters: for they are
evil of digestion.

For the disease of the poulmon or lyghtes / make this plaster: A plaster for
diseases of the lights.
Take the croume of white bread three ounces / Terpentine two ounces / Anise two
ounces / Cumine three ounces / Honey four ounces: all these seth in white wine /
and let them seth / until the wine is near hand sodden away: make a plaster
hereof / and lay it upon his poulmon / as warm as he can suffer it / and the
pain shall be swaged. The Same plaster is good also laid upon other grefes /
and it is good also for the breath.

If the disease of the lyghtes were come upon one of a stinkinge or venomous
air / then must ye give him within three days a purgation / namelye three
morninges the one after the other a penyweyght of fine Tyriakle in a draught of
warm wine. After yt anoynte him with this salve: Take Terpentine / Aqua vite /
of each an ounce / Dialthea three quarters of an ounce: mix these together / and
struck it upon his breast. He that has this disease / it is necessary that he
be continently helped / for he might lightely dye of the infection. This drink
following is a special medicine for him every morninge and evening taken two
ounces. A drink for the infect poulmon or lyghtes*
Take Licoris an ounce and an half / Brake of the wall an ounce / the midst
pyll or shell of Ground pyne called in Latin Chamepitis three quarters of an
ounce / Figs / Raysins / sede of Malowes / of each three quarters of an ounce /
Maiden heir / Isope of each a handful / Barley an ounce / water a pottel: Braye
them that are to be brayed / and seth them with the water / that the water be
sodden away two finger breadth / then let it stand so al night / and in the
morninge strain it / and then drink thereof as is said before.

Item they yt consume sore / whose eyes wax deep in their heads / they cough
much / and have pain in the left side / and about the breast / them may ye
help of this wise: For a co^sumpci^^
Give them Diapenidion or Diagragantum / and make them this drink: Take three
ounces of Licorise / Anis sede / and Isope / of each a handful / seth these all
in a quarte of water / strain it through a cloth / and put thereto at the lest
half an ounce / or three quarters of an ounce of Sugar. Mark also whether they
have any heat / for then give them mylk to drink. Make them also
suppositories of honye and salt. If they cough and their blood be evil / then
let them blood upon the hand or in the arm. Their meats may be hogs fete
/ chykins / motton / new baken bread / and stale drinks.

Item when a man can not well draw his breath / then help him of this wise:
Take Syropum de Sticados four ounces / Syropum de Calamenta / and Syropum de
Hyssopo / of each two ounces / mix them together and use it.

A good barlye water for all diseases of the Poulmon or Lyghtes.
A special barley water for many diseases.
TAke half a pound of fair Barley / a galon of water / half an ounce of
Licorise / Fenel sede / Violettes / Persely sede / of each a quarter of an ounce
/ Read roses a quarter of an ounce / dry Isop / and Sauge of each a penyweyghte
/ six leaves of Hearts tongue / a quarter of an ounce of Figs or Raysins:
sees all these in a new pot / that the water be sodden away two finger
breadth / and set the pot in cold water / and then strain the clear from
it / and drink it. The Same cools the liver and all the members / drives
away all evil heat / slaketh thyrste / causes to cast out much / purges
the lights / the spleine and the kidneys / the bladder / and causes to make
well water / and is specially good for all agues / that come of heat.

How to help a man that has a disease or a stiche in his side / or an evil
spleen / or an aposteme with in upon his rybbes.
Pain or stiche in the side and the tokens of it.
Pain in the side comes of evil stinkinge moystnesse / which causes an
imposteme in the left side upon the ribs. If the aposteme comes upon the
ribs / then dies a man lyghtely within three days of the stenche of the
aposteme / strikinge to the heart / without a spedy remedy be sought. First
ought he to be well letten blood in the Median in the right arm: and if the
aposteme is in the right side / the^ ought he to be letten blood in the left
arm. And before all is it to be known says Galen / whereby the aposteme is
occasioned / before ye ministre ought to him / and also in which side the
disease is. If it is in the right side / then comes it of the liver: If it is
in the left side / then comes it of the spleen: and therefore have Hipocrates
and Auicenna said / that he that has this disease / should be letten blood in
great quantitye / after that his strength is.

If the disease is in the left side / than does his heart shake and beat / and
has great pain in his left side / hands and fete are cold / pain in the
reins / strong and fervent agues / and great stichynge when the ague comes
upon him: the disease is come of Flegma and black Colera.

But if the disease is in the right side / then comes it of the liver and of
superfluous blood / and therefore is it requisite to minishe a great deal of
the patientes blood at the beginning / after that he has strength. And he
that has this disease / the same has febres acutas / and great pain in the
forheade / and all his members do ache. He has also in his sleep many
imaginacions and dreams / and thyrsteth: all sweet meats are contrary to him
/ and lists after sour meats and eger / he has also great heat in the
liver. His face and eyes also are read / his nose continuallye sharp and
seere or dry: the second day after that the disease leaves him / than
changes his face / and the nails of his fingers become white. These
foresaid tokens are not good / for they signifye the death of the patiente
within three days. If the patient in the beginning of this disease does list to
drink wine / then ought the Physicion to beware how to counsel him.

When a man has a stich in his side / then give him to drink water of Morsus
diaboli / (that is an herb / whose root is as it were bitten of) either
distilled or sodden. Likewise also does Saffron drunk. Or else take honey and
milk of a Cow of each half a pint / let the^ be well warmed together / wet a
linen cloth of half an elle long and broad therein / and lay it so warm
thereupon / and the stiche will straight way be alayed.

Howbeit I have always put thereto wheaten meel three quarters of an ounce / and
two penny weight of beaten saffron / straked upon the cloth / and laid warm
upon it like a plaster. But in summer did I lay the leaves of white Horehunde
/ chapped small / and put in a bag / sodden in milk / pressed out / and
laid warm upon the side / the same swaged it. I have sometime also used it
seere.

Or else take a fine lynnen cloth / and fold it so / that it be a spanne long /
wet it in the pacients urine / while she is yet warm / press it out a little
for droppinge / and lay it where the stiche is. And when it is dry / then
wett it again therein: the same draws the humors out / and alayeth the
stiche forth with. Though this science does not so wholye aid / yet does it
not hurt / though it were a woman in chyldes bed. Or else take a cold flinte
stone or pauing stone and hold it upon the sore place / and the blood draws
back / and the paciente is healed.

The barks of an Ash tree / sodden in wine / and droncken of him that has a
hard spleen / the same does weaken it without doubt: This may ye prove of this
wise: Give a swyne the same barckes to eat nine days one after the other / and
when it is slain / look after the spleen / and ye shall not find it half.

He that has pain in his side / let him take a kake of beaten Linesede / seth
it in water / and wet a linen cloth therein / and lay it warm upon the side /
and it shall fayde strayghtwaye. When a man has a pain in his side / and
specially in the left side / then take a quarte of white wine / the sixte
part of a quarte of honye / a hand full of Percely / or else two ounces of the
sede thereof: sees the same in a new pott / the sixte part away / give him
the same to drink when it waxes cold / both in the morninge and eueninge /
and he shall wax whole doutlesse. Or else if a man has great stiches and
pain in his side / I took half a pound of milcke / two ounces of honye / an
ounce of wheaten meel / a penyworth of Saffron / and laid it warm thereon.

Of all diseases of the bellye / and his parts annexed.
ANis sede / howsoever it is used / drives out winds / that be strayenge in
the guts / and combre the stomach / and chafe the liver: it makes also good
digestion / and is good against belkinge or breakinge up of sour winds / of a
cold and undigested stomach.

If any person / either man or woman had a grepinge in his guts / specially
the frettinge in the great guts / and he or she were poor: let him take a
little wax candle / and make thereof a cross upright / upon a piece of papir /
the bigness of a groate / festened or clyued upon the belly / and lightened /
and a little glass set thereon: the same draws the pain to it. Or else take a
bondel of raw hemp threde / and seth it in water where are many ashes / and
lay it so warm upon the belly.

If ye have no hemp threde / then do as I did when I was called by a woman /
that was at the point of trauaylinge / and had so great pain in her bellye /
that the child lept up and down / so that all they that were about her /
were astonnyed / nether durst any man minister ought to her: I band both her
legs above the kne hard and fast with a band / and let it so always an Aue
Maria / and then losed it again a little space / and band it again so often /
till the pain was holy taken away.

Auicenna says / that a man may well drink hot water in Colica passide /
that is grepinge in the great guts / and also when the spleen ryseth and
swells.

If any man were mistempered and hard in his body / another could make water /
then take two hand full of Wormwood / cut it small / and put it in a bag a
quarter of an elle long and broad / seth the same in half water / half wine
/ strain it out a little / that it drop not / lay it upon his body as warm
as he can suffer it half an hour long / and let him eat twelve carnels of
Peaches. And when the bag waxes cold / then let him warm it again in the
former water and wine / and this shall he do in the morning / at none / and in
the eueninge: of this wise shall the mistemperaunce of the body and hardness
be alayed / and he shall well make water.

Or else take branne and water Cresses / of each alyke / about two quartes /
chappe the water cresses very small / make a bag large a quarter of an elle /
and as long / that it may well reche about your loins / then put the water
cresses and branne therein / steare them well / lest they cluster / seth it well
in a kettel with water / anoynte the loins with Meye butter / or other butter
so big as an egg / and it that is left of the butter / lay upon the nauel /
and cover it with a little dishe: then press the back a little out / lest it
drop / and wind it about the patient as warm as he can suffer it: do this
in the morninge / at none / and to bedwarde / let it lie an hour or more at
every time / after that he is strong and can suffer it. Let him lie upon his
back for the most part / for that mollifieth the body well / takes away the
mistempering and the pain / and causes to make well water: but before any
thing look he have sieges.

Dryenes of the digestion.
Sometime does it fortune also nature to become so dry and seere / that the
meat can not void for great drought / whereof he has so great pain / that he
even swells. If the disease is of a swellinge / that shall ye know thereby /
that he is swollen and has pain / so that he can nether night nor day have
any rest / but cries continually. The Same may ye help of this wise: Take
Cotton / old or stale butter / vinegre / salt / of each three ounces: put
the same in a pan / and stere them together / seth them without burninge /
until they wax a little thick: then take a fylt or thyck woollen cloth / upon
the same sow a piece of sustein or other linen cloth / and thereon struck this
foresaid confection. And when the pacient does demand it / or has need of it /
then warm it by the fire / and anoynte him well with oil of Camomille and
oil of ^ilye well warmed / where he has the greatest pain / and then lay the
plaster thereon as warm as he can suffer it. This shall ye do in ye morninge
/ at none and eueninge / and it shall ease him both of the swellynge and pain.
Mark also / that if there be to little salve upon the plaster / then struck
more thereon / or else if it fall of with the warmth: for she ought to be a
finger thick at the least. It were good also he did bath in water / wherein a
basket full of Malowes are sodden / as warm as he can suffer it / and ye must
take heed that he have good sieges / and give him to eat meats of light
digestion / as are sheep or calves heads / chekins / and such like. But if he
can have no sieges then give him a quarter of an ounce of Electuariu^ rosarum /
with the weight of five barley corns of Diagridion: mix the^ well together
with warm wine / and give him it before day / if he will / let him drink
again thereupon: and if he can / let him walk upon his drink / for that is
good: if not / let him beware of sleep. And if he ca^ have no sieges thereof /
then be sure / that he is bound and swollen within / and therefore must he be
helped strayghtwaye with suppositories of Alume: but if they will not help /
then set him a clister therewith: Take milk and half an ounce of Fra^kincense /
put the same into a new pot / wherein are put hot koles: put the same under a
stole with a hole / and set the pacient thereon / that the vapoure may go up
into him as hot as he can suffer it. But before ye set the pot with the
coals under the stool / lay an hour or twain this plaster upon the
pacientes body: Take Malowes with the roots / wash them clean / chap them
small / seth them in water until they wax weak: then press the^ well / and
frye them in a pan / in a pint of butter or fat / till it wax a little dry /
and then let it cool: And when it is so dressed / than put it into a fine
linen bag / like a cussin: And the sack must be a quarter of an elle broad /
and sowed together and laced / like a pillowe. And when ye have need of this
kussin / then put it into a kettel with water / and seth it / till it waxes
hot: the^ press it out that it do not drop / and lay it about the
pacientes body / as warm as he can suffer it: and set him there with upon a
stool / and set the pot there under / as is said before: this weakeneth
the swelling with in and without / and causes an easy siege without hurt.
This were good for them that have hard sieges / and have the matter burnte
within them / whereby they void it with pain. To such ought to be ministered
in a draught a syrope of Violettes / and in the morninge half an ounce of
succus Rosarum: If the same does not work within a hour / then lay the
foresaid plaster thereon / and set him upon the stool with the pott under it /
as is specifyed before / and then shall he have sieges without any smarte.

To cleanse the guts.
TAke half an ounce of meel of Fenugrecum / seth that with a pint of water /
and pour of the clear / mix to the same an ounce of honey / and drink thereof
in the morning and eueninge.

For them whose guts are gnawen or wounded.
Fretting of guts
The Same shall be marked thereby / in his sieges issues blood also / and that
happens by two causes / the one is outward / the other inward. The inward
cause is by reason of an unclean and pearsynge moystnesse / caused by a salt
Flegma / and the same wou^deth or fretteth the guts. But the outward cause is
/ some great labor / which a man does / and strayneth him sore / so that the
guts are thereof so fretted / that the blood follows thereafter.

If ye will know whereof it is / then take heed to the matter / that issues
from him with the blood: If it be reed / then is it of Colera: but if it is
as the uncleanness of the nose / then is it of Flegma. After that must ye take heed whether the blood comes of the upper guts / or of the nethermost
guts / or else the middelmost guts. If it comes from the uppermost guts
/ then has he pain above the nauel: if it issues from the nethermost guts
/ then has he pain beneth the nauel.

When now the blood comes from the vpyermoste guts / then give the pacient
his medicine into his mouth. Is it of the reed Colera / then give him gum
Arabic with the juice of Porcelen / with a syrop of Mirtill / and give him
syrop of Roses / and give him bread styped in Almondes beaten / and give him to
drink water sodden with small rasins.

But when the blood comes from the nethermost or middelmost guts / and that
of the reed Colera / then give him a clister with these things: Take Roses /
yolks of Eggs / Porcelene / and pilled Barley sodden in water / and make a
clister hereof.

Restrai^te in the small guts, and the signs of it.
Sometime happens a restraynt in the small guts / by reason the slimye matter
strayeth / because she can not void beneth / and then rises it up toward the
throat with perbreakinge. This disease happens sometime of an hot aposteme in
the stomach. It comes also of a cold humor / that is gathered in the
stomach. The restraynte caused by an aposteme / is known thereby / that the
belly is swollen / and he draws wind or breath vneasely: he gets also an
ague and great thyrst. But if the restraynt were of a cold humor / the same is
not swollen in the bellye / and he is without an ague or thyrste: his hands
and fete are cold / he is heavy and waketh much / another can rest in one place
/ sometime will he have this / sometime that. He that is thus diseased / dies
lightely the third day / and he is paynfull to heal.

If ye will take in hand to heal such a disease / then take heed first / where
of such restraynte is caused. If it is caused by an aposteme / then give him
Cassia fistula with Iera picra / tempered with oil of Violettes. If the sickness
is strong / the^ let him blood in the liver vein / and make him a clister with
Malowes / Barley / Lentils / and oil of Violettes. But if the restrainte is
come by cold humors / the^ cleanse the pacient Benedicta / and with Iera picra /
the same do expel / and make him a clister of Dill Fenegreke / Oil of Camomille
/ and oil of Holder. Or else take the flower of Fenegreke half an ounce / and
honey a quarter of an ounce: mix the same together with warm water / so much as
need is / and give him the same to drink fasting and to bedwarde: the same
purges the guts of the superfluous slyme / whereof is caused sometime great
pain and grepinges.

But for the greping as in the great guts / take ye bladder of a Swine / and
put it full of warm wine / lay it upon the nauel as hot as ye can suffer it
/ do it often / and it shall take away the pain / the same has often ben
experimented and proved. Or else take a black Hen / and lay her warm upon the
nauel / cut it in two pieces or sliced quick. Against any manner of other
grepinge / take the heart of a Wolffe and the guts / dry them / and make
powder of them: put the same into a box. In that powder grow little worms /
let the same therein / and when ye will use the^ / take the^ one after the other
/ bray or break the^ with wine / and give it him to drink.

Or else take half an ounce of oil of Benedicta / oil of Camomil / oil of
Melissa or Baume / of each a quarter of an ounce / mix them together / and bid
the pacient lie upon his back / and put four or six drops of the oils in
to the pacientes nose / as warm as he can suffer it with a fether or other
thing: lay a whot cloth upon it / and let it lie still. Do this often / and let
him beware of cold things in his meats or drinks.

Or else take white cattes dounge / brayed and made fine to powder / stere that
with whyt wine / and give it him to drink three times. Or else take reed nettels
that have reed flowers / with the roots a good handful / seth them well with
a pint of good wine / cool it / and give him it to drink.

How to drive away the worms in the bellye.
THe worms called Lumbriciin Latin / growyng in the body / shall ye know of
this wise: Lu^brici, that is, worms in the bellye.
the pacient has pain about the nauel and ye guts / and sometime do they
void beneth or above. When they are found / howsoever they are engendered / ye
shall help the pacient of this wise: Take a quarter of an ounce of Herteshorne /
and as much salt / and seth it with four spounfuls of water / and give him
the same to drink: do this often / and they shall all dye.

This is also a noble medicine and often proved: Take yolks of eggs / and a
little chalk / and four spounfull of strong vinegre: give the same the paciente
to drink in the morninge fasting / and do this three morninges one after the
other / and they shall dry without dout. After that give him a quarter of an
ounce of Esula / and the same dryueth away from him all the worms and
fylthynesse.

This is also a sure and proved medicin: He that has worms in his belly /
the same shall drink water sodden with honey / and that shall he do twyse or three
times fasting / that the worms may be drouned therewyth. After yt shall he
drink the juice of Wormwood / Fumiterre / Peaches / and leaves of Beans:
hereof must they all dye: Or else take ij. ounces of the juice of Wormwood / an
ounce of Oxes gall mixte together / and straked upon the belly. And if ye put
half an ounce of Aleopaticum and Euphorbium / then helps it so much the
better: howbeit the gall of an Hare were better then of an Ox.

Against the worms in the belly take onyons and pyll them / cut or slyse them
small / power springinge water over them / let it stand so all night / and in
the morninge drink that water / and it drives away al worms. Pour the same
water upon the earth where worms are / and within half an hour shall they
crepe out of the earth.

Likewise if one eat garlike fasting / it kills and drives out worms out
of the body Or else drink distilled water of knotgrasse or shauegrasse /
the same kills worms also: howbeit it works more in young then old folk.

If a man had no sieges and were stopped.
To make sieges.
ARe they of middel age / than give the^ three quarters of an ounce of
Diacarthami. But if it is a man of a great and strong body / then give him
half an ounce of it half an hour before day / and walk well upon it / if he
can / another eat nor drink before he have had sieges.

But if he can not walk for sycknes / then let him be carried / or sit upright
in his bed / and let his back / body and legs be softely rubbed: and if he is
so strong / let him turn him self from the one side to the other. Let him
fast iij. or iiij. hours at the least after that he has taken it.

But if it were to hard / then let him drink a good draught of warm water /
the night before: that helps very well / that it may work so much the
better in the morninge. And if the pacient were of a very hot and dry
complexion / and that his sieges were hard / then give him two nights and two
morninges before / every morning a good draught of syrop of Violettes to
drink / specially the night before he will take the comfecte. But if ye have
no syrop of Violettes / then drink a good draught of whaye of milk blood
warm / and anoint the navel with creme / the same soffteneth well. But I have
sometime taken for poor people only the Gall of an ox / and swynes fat or
greece of like quantity / molten together / and straked their nauel well
therewyth / and laid thereon of it as big as a walnut / and covered a dishe
upon it. But if he was cold / then took I butter in stead of swynes greece /
and did as is specified before / the same mollifyeth very well. Give him also in
the morning half an ounce of Electuarium de succo Rosarum / mixed with a broth
of fresh Byfe / that is not to fatt: give him a good draught of ye same to
drink / as hot as he can brouke it: the same drives ye matter out / and
makes her apt to void. But if he can have no whaye / then give him a good
broth of white unsalted Peasen in the evening / in stead of the whaye: and in
stead of the flesh broth / take an unsalted broth of whyt Peasen / without
any fatness. If ye will have it to mollifye yet more / put thereto the third
part so much of roots of Malowes / as is of the Pease broth: and this shall ye
use in stead of the syrop of Violettes. When he has taken the purgacion in the
morning / if he is strong / then let him walk well thereupon: Against
perbreakinge of co^fections taken.
if not / let him sleep thereupon / but it were better not.

Some men there are / which when they take ye Electuaries or co^fectio^s / do
perbreake / by reason of their sweetness: wherefore ye may give them half an
ounce of Diaprunis laxatiui / the same is sour / and has the same operation /
and dryueth out very easily.

But if such a siege did tarry until the evening before it did work then seth
him a water with a little Licoris / and a little Honey / and when he goes to
bed / let him drink a good draught of this water / blood warm: the same
mollifyeth very well / that it may void / and he may have a siege without
any harm and uncase / and after that give him nine Pyllulas communes.

But if it were a fish day when he would take it / then give him a pease broth
instead of a fleshbroth / as is specified before.

He also that has a wambling in his stomach / or does lightely perbreake /
when he has taken ought: Vva^bli^g of the stomach of purgacions taken*
let the same hold a piece of tosted bread before his mouth / as warm as he
can suffer it. For as soon as the stomach perceyueth the sauoure of the bread /
then does the wamblinge alaye.

If a man had taken ought / to cause him to have sieges / and it would not
wide nevertheless / and him thought he should do his easemente / and yet
could not: then take Brenne / Malowes / both the herb and roots of like
quantity / chappe the herbs small / and seth these well in water ^ and set the
pacient in that water until the nauel / as warm as he can suffer it / and it
shall weaken in a man / that he shall have sieges. But if he will not bath /
then put the Branne and herbs together / and put them in two small bags like
in kussins or pylowbeers / and lay the one of them before upon his belly and
nauel / and the other behind upon his loins / as warm as he can suffer them.
The Same mollifyeth him well / that he may have sieges without hurt.

If a man had taken a medicine laxatiue / and it were to strong for him / so
that he must do his easement to often / whereof he might get a grepinge or other
inconvenience: Restrai^te of overmuch sieges or greping.
then make a little shete warm / and lay it upon his bellye and loins / as
warm as he can suffer it: and let him lie upon his back / and cover him warm
/ and lie still a good while / and the grepynge shall go away without hurt.

When the gutte (where through the ordure passes) goes out / how to set it
in again.
When the last or nethermost gut / through the which the ordure voydeth from
man / goes out of the body also / which comes of a siege / and if that
does happen often / it must be forsene / or else does it bring to a man great
inconvenience. Help him of this wise: Of goi^g out of the gutt with sieges.
Take the herb called in Latin Ononis / or Resta bonis / both herb and rote /
chappe it small / seth it well in water / till it wax soft / put it into a
little bag / sit upon it while it is warm: do this three times in the day /
and when it waxes cold / warm it again in the former water: of this wise
remains it soft and thynne. Or else bake him a little cake with this foresaid
herb / or with his read flower like to a pease flower: or if ye will / give
him the same with a slyce of bread / and this has been experimented and found
true. This must be used eight days long. But if ye can not have this herb /
take twelve hand full of meel or powder of Oken barks / put the^ into a bag /
seth them as before / and sit thereon / and it goes in again.

An other true and proved science / when the basse or last gut issues or is
swollen.
TAke worms / chap them small / and braye them well / and put so much oil of
roses thereto / that it become as a thick broth: stere it well and struck it
upon a linen cloth / the thycknesse of a finger / let the cloth be soft / and
a hand broad. Lay this upon the sick place as warm as the paciente can
suffer it: and when it is cold / then lay straight way another thereon /
the same helps well and continentlye. It is good also to wette a soft cloth
in milk / and lay it upon the sick place / where the gut is gone out: and
when the same is cold / take it away / and lay another warm in the stead of
it. If the place is swollen or waxed hard / the gut shall return into the
body by little and little without any harm. Yet is it better to seth Malowes
in goats milk till they be weak / and lay them warm upon it: the same
mollifye it without any hurt / that the gutte enters again easelye*

Towe dypped in the juice of Sloes / is very good for him / whose basse gut is
issued: for laid upon it / drives it in again without any hurt. Or else take
the powder of burnt eggs shales / warm and strew it upon it / and lay a warm
cloth upon it / and that helps.

When a man has to many sieges / how that may be let.
SIeges that are overmuch / are diverse. The one is / that the stomak does
digest the meat and drink of a man the better / because he has a faut in the
power retentiue. An other is by reason of superfluous moisture in ye stomach or
guts: or else the power retentiue has force in the stomach / and so in the
guts / by reason of fylthy moisture / that is hot and prickinge.

If the disease is in the power retentiue / which should retayn the meat in
the stomach / then must it be considered / what moisture or humors be gathered
in ye stomach / and whence they come. If the disease comes of evil complexion
/ then must the pacient be demanded / whether he feleth any heat in his
stomach / and whether he has great thyrst / and whether he have a bulkinge or
breakinge of wind: for thereby may it well be gessed / whether the siege be
of overmuch heat or not. If he have no thyrste / and eats well / but
digesteth slenderly: then is his siege caused of cold / and therefore does the
stomak digest evil. He that will stay that siege assuredlye / must eat and
drink little / and use two or three days no more but one kind of meat / and be
still: by that shall the stomach be satled / and also the fundamente / and
also the running staunched without hurt or danger.

These meats do bind a man in his belly: hard eggs / and Payst made with
eggs / and baken in the herth / roasted Peers / bake^ meats / Rice made with
almo^de milk / potages of barley / Barley water / Beans / Peers dried in an
oven / Amilum / Medlers / Sugar of roses. Or else take the stones or carnels in
the grapes / beat them well / put them in a cloth / lay them in reyne water
or springinge water a day and a night / then strain the water well out / and
drink a good draught thereof fasting in the morning and at even to bedwarde:
the same stops the hot flux very well. Or else eat Sloes / that stops
sieges whether they be of heat or cold. Or else eat Moulberies dried /
the same stop sieges. Likewise also do Bremble beries not fully ripe / and
dried and eaten / stop all manner of sieges / caused of great heat.

A plaster for sieges.
TAke a quarte of Akornes dried and made to powder / mixte with the white of an
egg and vinegre in manner of a plaster upon a cloth / and laid about the
loins. But it were better to lace ye plaster upon the belly under the nauel /
and so about ye body / as warm as he can suffer it: and when it is dry / then
refreshe it again with ye white of an egg and vinegre / as is said before /
and powder it fine again. This may be done three times.

A good science for the bloudye flixe and other sieges or flixes / of what
cause soever they be / and it stops very^ well.
TAke a Turtel / put it in a pot / and cover it / set it in an oven / till it
be burnt all to powder: and if any man has a flixe / let him take an egg /
warm it well by the fire / open it / and put away the white: then take of the
powder / as much as a chest nutte / mix it with the yolke / and eat it
fasting / do this three mornings / and it shall be staunched / and it is
specially good for all manner of bloody flixes. Or else seth the Turtel with
water / salt her not to sore / but let her be well sodden with a broth / and
give it the pacient / and it stops him.

Disenteria is a bloody flixe / coming sometime from the guts / sometime from
the liver / sometime from the stomach. If it is from the ^iuer / then has he
pain in his right side / then can he scarsely be helped. But if it is from the
stomach / then has he pain in the holowe of the heart / and that is deadly:
for the small guts are nearehande rased and gnawen through. But if he has
pain beneth the nauel / then comes it from the great guts / and he may be
yet well helped. Ye must also mark / that the bloudye flixe must not be
staunched so suddenly / till ye evil matter is voyded / and ye guts be
cleansed. After that help him thus: Give him whay of Goats milk and barley
water of each like much / put a little honey in the barley water / and seth the^
together / and skomme them. After that put the whey thereto / and stere them
together / and then take it from the fire / and give the pacient always thereof
to drink blood warm with milk / both in ye morning / none and eueninge* this
heals the guts inwardly. Likewise also does water of Waybrede drunk in the
morning / at none and eueninge.

Against the bloody flixe / take a quarter of an ounce of Sanguis draconis /
made to powder / drink it in a potage or broth / or else eat in a weak or
soft egg: the same is experimented that it stops: or else give him Knotgrasse
to eat upon a soppe / or in some potage / or else howsoever he can eat it / or
else in an egg as is said before / and that stops the blood / both above
and beneth.

A true medicine for the bloody flixe.
TAke the tappettes or slouringe of Walnuttes and Filberts when they florishe /
new gathered after that they be fallen from ye trees / and put them into a
basin / and dry them in the Son or in an oven / that they rot not: beat them
to powder / and he that has the bloody flixe / give him a quarter of an ounce
thereof in an egg roasted with oil / till it be hard: and eat three morninges
so much thereof at every time / and fasting. And if it will not be staunched
/ then give him half an ounce of this powder in an egg.

Yet another for the bloudye flixe / which comfort the stomach / and
seasoneth the mouth if it is unseasoned: for surely it cools him and slaketh
thyrste / and dryueth away the heat of the liver. Take sugar of Roses as
much as a chest nut / and a quarter of an ounce of Sanguis draconis made to
powder / and give him a good draught of reyne water to drink upon it / or else
conduyte water / or yet barley water. And if ye can have nether of these / then
seth well crosted broune bread in water: the courser the bread is / ye better
is it: Let the water be a good pint / and the crostes as much as a fist / and
let him eat thereof often in the day / and specially to bedwarde / at night /
and in the morninge. It were good also that he had sometime pylled Almondes /
that have lain long in cold water / or else to give him a slyce of bread
styped in cold water / the same cools and stopped very well. Or else take two
flynt stones / and a piece of style / and make them glowynge whote / and lay
them than in milk of a Cow / and thereof drink fasting a good draught blood
warm. Do this three morninges / and it shall avoid. Ye may also heat
flyntstones and style / and lay them in milk / and drink thereof in the
morninge and at eueninge. Or else take the rotes of Burres as much as a penye
loaffe / chappe them small / and seth them in a new pot with good wine / let
the paciente sit over them / that the vapor may go up into him: do that often /
and the flixe shall staunche / whereof soever it be. It stops also the
flowers of women / when they have the^ to sore. Also take Peers dried / and
seth them in water / and drink thereof / and it shall staunche / and after a
laxatiue / does it stop the sieges continently.

Binding meats.
These meats ought they to eat / that have sieges: roosted Pygeons / and all
meats that dry / as are Lentilles / Rice / Amilum / pared or shaven
Herteshorne / or else Beenes sodden with vinegre until they pearche / and give
him these to eat three days continuallye / nether give him any other meat.

How the flixes may be known.
When the bloody flixe comes from the vppormost bowels / the^ issues from
man pure blood / with digestion of the fylth of man's body / and thereof gets
a man great pain in the vpperpart of his body or nauel. Him may ye help of
this wise: Flixe of the uppermost bowels.
Take He^psede / braye or beat the same well / and put a little water upon it /
strain it through a cloth. Then seth two eggs / yt they remain very soft /
and put of the He^psede milk thereto / as much as all the eggs be / beat the^
well together / and take ye fasting: the same stops the flixe / and auoydeth
the pain. Or else seth ye roots of Burres or the sede in water / or them both /
and drink it fasting: but it were very good to seth the sede in reyne water.

If it comes of the middelmost bowels or guts / than is the siege or flixe
colored black with blood / or else grene with the same. Flixe from the middelmost
bowels.
To cure the same is make a vaporacio^ beneth with Ra^mes grease or fat / wax /
pitche and Cumin each of like quantity / put the^ in a new pot / and cover it
close / set it upon a fire / till it wax through hot / and do smoke sore: than
set it under a stole with a hole / and set the pacient thereon / as hot as he
can suffer it.

But if the blood comes of the nethermost bowels / then is the siege yt
issues therewyth yalow / black / pale / or else of a grene deadly color.
Flixe of the nethermost guts or bowels.
The same may be helped of this wise: Give him roasted Ra^mes flesh to eat / and
old hens sodden / and specially the fete / and barley water to drink. Item
Almonde milk with water / the same comfort the heart.

But if the siege be by reason a man has eaten ought that is unwholesome / then
ought he not be staunched so sone.

There is also a flixe / called the white siege / in Latin Lienteria / the same
is / when the meat is voyded undigested. Lienteria, and the causes of it.
The Same siege comes sometime of slymy matter lyenge in the stomach / and that
is known by the heuinesse of the stomach.

Of pain in the Loins.
The Same comes sometime of heat / sometime of cold. When it comes of heat
/ then vanishes all te pacientes moisture / and his urine becomes reed / or
else yalow as an Orange appel. Pain in the Loins.
He yt has that disease / give him the milk of a So with Dragaga^tum / and
Malowes / make a potage therewith and he must beware of all such things as
chafe or warm him / and of salt meats / and give him all coolinge meats /
or else give him potages made of barley and Spinach / that cools well / or else
give him a Barley potage with butter / for that cools and mollifieth him well:
If he has the power and is able / give him Triasandali.

Pain in the loins and back comes sometime by overmuch companyenge with
women. The Same help of this wise: Pain in the back and loins.
Let him beware of women / and if he has heat or thyrste / then give him
sugar Candye / and let him beware of all hot things. But if he has no
heat / then give him such things as do warm him moderatly / and let him go
to some bath / and eat meats of good digestion.

Item if he have any fault in his liver / let him take heed thereto / for the^
must he not bathe / before his heat of the Liver be swaged.

But if the pain in the loins comes of cold / then has the paciente no
lust upon women / and his back does ache very sore / and also his thyghes: his
urine is whytysh as water. Let him beware of oil / or any fat meats / whether
it be flesh or fish / and of all such things as cool the stomach. Make
also this plaster / and lay it upon his back and loins / as warm as he can
suffer it: Take Fenel and Smalage alyke much / chapped small and beaten in a
mortar / take of each as much as man's head / and put thereto Dyll sede / oil
of Mastix / Befe suet / of each two ounces and an half: put these into a pan
/ and when it waxes hot / then cast the herbs in also / and frye them well
together / and lay it between two fine clothes / and lay it about his loins
/ as warm as he can suffer it: and when it is cold / warm it again in the
pan / and lay it up again. Let him do this three days / and it shall avoid
without any harm or pain / and does sone help.

Cure general.
If this disease ouertaketh young folk / that be between twenty and fyfty years
/ they may well be helped. They must be let blood before all medicines. But if
this diseas takes aged folk / that be above three score years / the same can
scarsely be helped / or not: their urine is sometime yalow and dim colored /
and when it has stand a while / then has it a cloud as it were a cobbe
weble or white cloud: the same are pale under their syghte and lean.

A true medicine for pain in the loins caused of cold.
TAke a quarte of flowers of Camomille / sees them in half wine / half water
/ and pour out the licour or water / and braye ye flowers in a mortar / till
they be all to bruised. Then put them again into the water / and seth them till
the water be clean sodden away. After that put them into a clean linen cloth /
a quarter of an elle long / and half a quarter of an elle broad / and lay it
as warm upon the pacientes loins / as he can suffer it. And when the loins
be well chafed therewyth / then take it away / and dry them with a cloth /
and anoint them with this ointment: Take a quarter of an ounce of Oleum
benedictum / oil of Camomill / oil of Spicanardi / of each a quarter of an
ounce / oil of Baye half an ounce / Dialthea / Aqua vite / of each a quarter of
an ounce. Put all these into a vessel / and set it by the fire / that it wax
warm: then anoynte the loins therewith: after that lay the flowers thereon
warm as before / when they be warmed again in the foresaid wine and water: Do
this in the morning and eueninge.

Cure of a vvoma^ with child.
But if a woman were payned in her loins of a cold / when she is with child /
it were good she were gyrded in her flanks / that the vapor did not stryke up
into her to the heart / and let her then sit upon the pott / wherein the bath is
/ that the vapor may stick up into her back / as whote as she can suffer it
/ and let her set her fete in the tobbe / where in the same water is / and so
cover her self with a mantel or long goune / that were good for her.

Take Garleke / Coriander of each two ounces / seth them with a quarte of wine /
till the third part be sodden in: drink that in the morning and evening.

If a man has pain in his loins of heat / then seth Fenel r^o^e^ with water
/ and drink that in the morninge and eueninge. Or else take Cheruel chapped
small / as much as a gouse egg / seth that in a pound of clarifyed wine:
Drink that to bedwarde / and eat the herb also fasting.

Against pain in the loins.
TAke Veruayne / Sauie / Lauender / Wild minte / of each two handful / seth
them well in a great pot / with three quartes of white wine / well covered and
stopped: put that into a tob / and sit upon it / and let the vapor go up into
thy back / until ye be well warmed. Then cause the sweat be wyped from your
back / till ye be dry. After that a joint your back with Befe suet molten /
when ye will go to bed / do this three nights together. This takes away pain
in the loins / and specially caused of cold.

Or else take honye and milk of like quantity / put the same into a new pot /
set it by the fire upon a treuet / seth it well / and lay it as warm upon thy
loins / as ye can suffer it: the same draws out the pain. And when it waxes
cold / then warm it again.

Another science for pain in the loins / that helps very well without
harm.
TAke Mullen / called Tapsus barbatus / distilled / struck the same well in to
his loins by a fire / in the morninge / at none and to bedwarde / and do that
nine days continuallye.

Sometime grow apostemes in ye loins of humors that are waltering and strayeng
in the body / wherwyth does come sometime a sore ague / and the pacient has his
members so heavy / that he thinks they do hang: Apostemes i^ the loins and
the signs thereof.
and the apostem in the loins does lightely become soft and so ripe / that i^
runs.

If the aposteme is in the right side / then let the pacient lie upon ye left
side. But if it is in the left side / then let him lie upon the right side.
After that mark whether it be of a hot humor / for then has the pacient
great thyrste / his urine is reed / and happily a great moisture wythall. But
if it is of a cold humor / then is the ague easyer / and his urine colored
like water.

If it is of a hot humor / then is his urine reed / and he has a duselynge.
Give him this medicine: Take the juice of Nightshade or Morel / the juice of
Fenel seth and strain them / and put under them Cassia fistula and oil of
Almondes / and give him this.

But if he has a restraynt / that he can have no sieges / then make him a
clister / and thereto take oil of Violettes / Barley / Malowes / oil of Roses
/ of each like quantity / and give him meats yt be moist and good of
digestion / and cooling. A restrai^t or bindynge with apostemacion.
He must beware of all meats yt warm / and of women / and be very still and
quiet without mouinge. Take also Coleworts and Fenigreke of each like much /
make the^ to small powder / and mix them together / and lay it upon his loins
where the pain is. But if ye aposteme does break / then bid him drink of an
Ass. Take also Barlye meel three ounces / Figs two ounces / six ounces of
Malowes / mix them well together / and wett a sponge therein / and bind it
upon the aposteme / and make him this clister: Take half a pound of Kowe milk
/ four ounces oil of Roses / beat them well together / and set him a clister
with it. The second day after make him a bath / wherein are sodden a pecke of
barley brayed / three bushels of the leaves of Malowes: let the same be well
sodden / and bath therein / that mollifieth the aposteme well / that it may
break out and run. But if the aposteme or matter were to thycke / that it
could not well run out / than take ye juice of Fenel / Smalage and Wormwood
/ of each like much: these ought to be sodden and strayned / and give him
half an ounce of them with an ounce of milk of Asses / beat them well together
/ and let him drink it fasting / the same mollifyeth the aposteme / that it
may run and void well: after that heal him with playsters and salues / and
cleanse him well.

But if his aposteme is come of cold / then give him meat of good digestion /
and warm moderately / bydde him rest always / and keep him as is said before.

How a man shall be helped that pisseth blood.
Pissinge of blood
Sometime does pass a hot humor through the loins / and lies there so long /
till it waxes slimye / and raseth or scrapeth them / yt the urine becomes
read or bloody. When that happens / the^ lay this bathing sponge upon the
loins: Take oil of nuttes and warm water like much / of each half a pound
/ beat them well together / then wet the sponge well therein / and lay it
upon the place / where the pain is. After that make him a plaster hereof upon
his loins / that be half an elle long / and a quarter of an elle broad: Take
the leaves of Roses well brayed / the meel of Lentils / mix them well together
/ that it become like a plaster / lay that upon his loins.

When it is dry / then put more of the foresaid oil thereto / and moyste^ it
enough therewyth / and lay it up again: the same takes away ye pain well /
and give him this drink fasting / the weight of a quarter of an ounce: Take
the seeds of a Gourde made to powder / Cumin beaten / and the seeds of Malowes
of each like much / so that they be together a quarter of an ounce / seth them
in two ounces of milk of Asses in a new pott. If ye can have no milk of Asses
/ then take instead thereof milk of a Kowe or Neet / the same is good also.

It is to be known / that milk is wholesome for all them that have this disease
/ drunk in the morninge / and eaten in the day. Give him also to eat suppes
of Almonde / and the yolks of soft eggs potched in hot water.

When a man pisseth blood.
Pissinge of blood and his causes and signs.
The Same comes sometime from the bladder / sometime of the liver / or else of the
veins that are in the back. If it comes of the bladder / then stinketh the
urine / and is troubled / and the blood is colored like matter / and a man
has pain about his preuye members. But if it comes from the liver / then
is the blood very thynne / he has pain in his right side. But if it comes
from his loins or reins / then has he pain in the back and reins. And if
it comes of superfluous blood / then are his eyes great / and then let him
blood in the liver vein in the right arm. But if it comes from the loins
/ then let him blood by the ankle above ye foot / if it is a woman: but if it
is a man / let him blood under the foot.

Sometime fortuneth it / that the veins that pass between the flanks and
bladder / do break or remove out of their place / so yt a man pisseth blood
thereof / the same may ye help of this wise: Ye must first let him blood in the
liver vein upon ye right hand / and the pacient must beware of women: for it
is not good / and might bring him to farther inconvenience: and let him beware
of all chafing meats / but eat cooling meats that are good of digestion.

It happens sometime also that a man pisseth blood / when he has taken
strong medicines for the stone / specially when he has taken the wings and
head of Cantarides / (which are grene worms / sheninge with a gloss like
gold / and a scale like a bittel.) To the same give fresh Akornes made to
powder to drink with wine.

When a man pisseth matter.
IF ye will know / whether it be of the grauel or stone / then gather a deal
of the urine in a vessel / and let it satle six hours. Pissinge of matter and
his cure.
After yt streyne it through a linen cloth / and that remains in the cloth /
take with thy finger / and if ye find either stone or grauel / then is the
matter also of the grauel or stone. Such a diseased must ye help of this
wise: Take yt less Shauing girss / called also Cattes tail / and Earth yuy /
of each two handful / and two ounces of Akornes beaten to powder / and half an
ounce of the husk whereby they hang at the tree / and as much of eggs shales
burnt till they be while: seth these with three pintes of wine / and a pint of
water / till the fourth part is sodden away. Drink thereof in the morninge /
after diner / and at night / at each time two eggs shales full / and do it so
long till the pacie^t be whole. And if ye have not enough / then make more.
And if he has ought / or is diseased with the freting or briseling stone
withal / then give him at every time as much of Ciche peasebroth withal / and
let him drink them together.

When a man can not piss / how the bladder ought be purged of her superfluous
slimishnesse.
When a man is diseased in his bladder / then has he these signs: Disease of
the bladder and the signs of it.
He thinks he is satisfied of meat or drink / another has lust to eat / and
the meat bullketh up again / sometime is he over hot / sometime over cold /
nether has any quiet sleep / the urine strayneth him: in his belly is he also
/ as though he were swollen. Help the same of this wise: Take Fenel sede /
karnels of Persely / Radice / Louage / the roots of Cariottes / seth them
very well in water / strain the^ through a cloth: then put whyt wine thereto /
seth the same with pepper / put this to the first broth / and seth it again /
and put it into a pot / and drink thereof fasting seven morninges one after
ye other / and ye shall be whole without hurt.

This following causes to piss easily.
TAke Horse radice as much as two eggs / slice it small / and seth it in a
pint of water very well: To piss easelye.
strain it through a cloth into a pott / and put as much honey thereto / as is
the rote: this may he drink when he will. Or else take Horse radice / as much as
two fystes / slice it small / stamp it / and put thereto three times as much
course branne: then put two quartes of water to it / and seth it till the water
be sodden in. Then lay the pacient upon this with his belly dounward / as
warm as he can suffer it: then warm it again with the water / and of this shall
he be caused lightely to make water.

If a child had the grauel or stone / and might not therefore make his water /
then take a handful of Akornes / and braye them a little / seth them with a
quarte of water till the third part be consumed: The grauel or stone of a
child.
then strain it through a cloth / and when that waxes cold / give it the
child to drink / as much it will / and it shall help him.

This does also make lightely piss and easily: Take the rotes of Persely the
herb of Dasye / and seth them in water / and give him thereof to drink in the
morning and eueninge. Or else put thereto distilled water of Radice / that may
he drink when he will. Or else give him the eyes of Crabbes made to powder to
drink with wine. And if it is a child / that it can not piss for the stone /
then give him it with milk to drink.

Another to make easelye piss: Take Persely / Smalage / Fenel / of like
quantity / chap them / and bray them small / and seth them a little: put butter
thereto / and lay it upon his preuy membre and loins / as warm as he can
suffer it: of that shall he make his water easily.

Or else take Smalage chapped small / as much as two fystes with ones as much
course branne / and seth that with water / till it wax dry: lay the same
upon the bladder. The Same is good for him / yt makes his water pain fully /
and thinks that his belly be swollen: and is specially good for them that are
grossly stopped in the bladder / for thereby do they piss.

For to piss easelye / and for the stiche and smartynge / and for the Brisynge
stone.
TAke two slices of a Garlyke head / pill them / and braye them well: the^
take a good handful of Malowes with the roots / wash them fair / chappe them
small / put them together into a new pot / put a quart of wine thereto / seth
it well half an hour / scomme it well / and beware that it do not run over
/ strain it through a cloth into a pot / and put thereto two ounces of sugar:
and when it is cold / then drink thereof when need requires / specially in ye
morning and evening / at each time a good draught / hold a piece of tosted
bread before his mouth / lest he perbreake.

This foresaid drink is specially good for the^ / whose bladder is unclean or
stopped / either of the grauel / stone or unclean slimye matter / wherefore he
can not make his water: for this drink mollifieth it / opens the condute /
and makes sone to piss.

But if a man were sore unclean / that he had been long without making of his
water / and thereof had he gotten a greping or sore / or were febled / or else
had a wambling and perbreaking / the same help thus without pain: Make him a
bag of soft linen cloth a quarter of an elle broad / that it may reach
about his body / from the navel till the privy members / and take ij. quartes
of brann / water cresses chapped small as much / put the together in to a bag
and lay them in water: but let the back be quilted / lest the branne cluster /
and seth it well. After that take the bag out / and let it drop well / and
lay it as warm upon his loins / as he can suffer it* yt takes away ye
griping and pain anon. If ye can get no water cresse / then take the bran
alone. Or else take ij. ryles full of yarme / and seth the^ well with water and
ashes / and lay the yarme as warm about him as he can suffer it. Or else take a
shert seth it in ashes / and hold it before him / and wind it about his body
and loins / that is good and helps him well: yet is the first yt best.
After that set him upon a stole with a hole / and take a pot / and put two
stones gloynge hot / as big as a fyst / set the pott under in the stole /
sit thereon / so yt the vapor may go no where out / and pour always a dish
full of water thereon / and let that vapor stryke up into the / as warm as ye
can suffer it. And if the stones be not hot enough / then take more stones /
yt they may cast heat enough / yt ye may sweat thereof. If it is a man / then
may he take yt foresaid drink made with the garlyke before the bath / and bind
the bag about his loins / for that helps very well. This may also be well
used alone / for it does help alone also / and lightely to piss without hurt.

But if a man can not make his water / or else pisseth very little / then take a
new brickstone / that never was wett / and make it gloyng hot / and seth
Cumin in good wine / and pour the wine and Cumin upon the hot stone / and set
it under the / and let the vapor stryke up into the / and the warmth and
pissinge shall come again to the.

Or else take water Cresses sodden in wine in a new pott / sit upon it as
warm as ye can s^^fre it / the same causes to make water well / and is also
experimented.

Or else take a good handful of the roots of the herb called Ononis or Resta
bouis in Latin / and seth them in a good quarte of wine / and give him thereof
to drink in the morning / at none / and to bedward. But if it is winter / that
ye can not have the roots / then take the toppet of an onyon / and put the same
into the man's yard: or else take the innermoste heads of onyons / and gather
them together / and put him then into the yard. But if ye have not that another
/ then take two or three lyce / so great as ye can get / and put them into the
yard / into the innermost hole / that goes into the bo^ye / and put a little
cloth therein / that they may crepe in / and he shall make water very well.

When a man has the Stranguria / that is difficultye to make water / or when
one pisseth in his bed in the night.
Against the Stranguria take Malowes / Garlyke / of each a handful bruise them /
and seth them in a quarte of wine / till the third yart be sodden away /
drink thereof three times in a day. Or else eat yt kernels of P^aches and
Akornes made to powder of each a like / mix that with wine / and drink it: if
he be not healed therewyth / then has he the stone.

When a young body does piss in his bed / either often either seldom / if ye
will help him / take the bladder of a Goat / dry it / that it may be made
to powder / the same powder ought to be given to drink with wine. Or else take
ye beans or hinderfallinges of Goats / braye the^ to powder / and give him of
ye powder in his meat in ye morning and evening / a quarter of an ounce at
every time: Or else give him a quarter of an ounce or more of Agrimonye / with a
little wine or broth says Bartholomeus de Montagnana: Or else give him
Hedghogges or Orchens made to powder at eue^ to bedward in a draughte of wine
this flesh is also wounderfully good eaten against that.

Or else take the powder that Montagnana sets in his Antidotarius / namely:
Take half an ounce of the inner skin of a hens mawe / yt ashes of a burnt
Hedghogge three quarters of an ounce / an ounce of Agrimony / stear them together
/ and give the pacient thereof a quarter of an ounce with a little wine or broth
when he goes to bed.

When a man gets the Stranguria or difficultye to make water / the^ anoint
him his nauel with suet warmed and no more / and it auoydeth very shortly.

Meats convenient for him that has the Stranguria.
Such diseased must beware of salt meats and smoked / as Hering / Ling / Coddes
/ grene Places / smouth fishes / as Isles / La^priles / Barbels / Te^ches: also
must he beware of fat meats as baco^ / pasteys or pyes / fatt chese / raw
milk: But they may well eat Pykes / Perches / Troutes and such like fishes /
breding in running waters. Let him also eschew all water foles / both wild and
tame. Let him eat the flesh of kiddes / potage of great Peasen / the roots of
Persely / Fenel / the herb or sede of Smalage / beaten barley. He must also not
eat his fill / and beware of fruytes. He may also make a bath of the flowers
of Camomille / Water cresses / Malowes / Betony / Cinckfoly / of each a
handful: seth these well close / and bath therein until above the nauel.

If ye will make it yet better / the^ put thereto the herb of marrish Malow or
Holyhoke / Cinckfoly / Fern / seth of each a handful / and boil it with ye
first bath. This bath is very good for the Stra^guria / and causes to piss
well. Let him beware of overmuch heat / let him drink good white wine / and
sodden sweet wine to bedward / and in the morning an hour before breakfast /
and temper it a little with water / wherein is sodden a quarter of an ounce of
Lettuse sede / beaten Licoris half an ounce / a handful of ye leaves of Hertes
tongue: seth these in three pintes of water / until the third part be sodden
away.

Of the stone / how he that has it / may be healed with convenient medicines.
Sometime does the stone engendre in the bladder / sometime in the loins.
Sometime does it engendre of unclean slymy matter / that is gathered in the
stomach / and is congeled together with an unclean slymy heat / and so waxes
a stone or grauel / which causes great pain and grefe.

When the stone grows in the loins / then aketh his back and loins / and be
somtymes as dead. But if the stone is engendered in the bladder / the^ has he
pain in ye forpart of his body / and he can not well make his water.

Sometime comes the stone of heat / and then is his urine read / and in the
bottom of the chamber pott or vrinal lies much grauel or sand / if it stand
an hour still: and that grauel or sand is read and hard when it is touched.
Such a pacient must beware of all hot medicines.

But if the stone is engendered of cold / then does the paciente perbreake often
/ and the sand synkinge in the bottom / is white. His urine is sometime clear /
and somewhat yelowe / as the whey of chese: and to such one are hot medicines
good.

This disease is cured sometime by cuttinge Surgeons expert in that thing.
But that the grauel or sandy stone may be voyded from a man / that he may be
rid of the pain or smarte / or yet the perbreakinge: ye must first se that
the pacient be purged of the unclean slymy fylth / and yt he have good sieges /
and give him this syrop to drink: Take the roots of Smalage / Fenel and
Persely / of each four in nombre / and of their seeds an ounce / Grummel two
ounces / small Trifle an ounce and a quarter / yt seeds of Chiches and Po^pones of
each an ounce / an ounce of ye sede of ye sharp Burres or Clotes / the herb of
Pinke nedle or Cranes bill / Colonder or Maidens heir / of each a handful /
six ounces of ye rotes of Brak of yt wall or Polipody: chap al ye rotes and
herbs small / and seth the^ in a quart of wine / and a quart of water to the
half: after that streyne it through a cloth / and deal it in two parts / and
to the one part put a pound of honey / and seth it always to the half / and to
the other part put a pound of sugar / and a quarter and a half of an ounce of
Cantarides without heads and wings / made to powder / and seth this the
third part away. Of this give to the pacient at every fourth day an ounce and
an half / with three ounces of water / wherein are sodden ye roots of Smalage
and Persely / and of the first syrop made with honey / give him every morning an
ounce and an half / mixed with four ounces of water made of the rotes before
specified: and of the other syrop / at every fourth day an ounce and an half /
mixed with iiij. ounces of the foresaid water / and then recouereth he. And if he
can not be healed there with / and that the stone were great and hard: then
were nothing better / then to cut it / if weakness did not hinder it.

He that has had pain of the stone a great season / or else an unclean bladder
/ whereof he has had a pain or shuting in his coddes: or else has a swellinge
above his preuye members: if ye will help the same / then bath him as hot / as
they be costumed to be bathed / which are grieved of the stone. After that take
milk / and sees the same with eggs / and drink the same blood warm in the
morning and evening / and ye shall perceive very unclean fylth to avoid from
you / both in the sieges / and urine: Do this a fourten night / and it shall
avoid.

If ye will break spedelye the stone / that he do bruise / take the Goats
blood / put it into a glass / and set it in the son to dry: after that
braye it small to powder. Take every eueninge to beddeward of the same powder
a quarter of an ounce with wine: and of this shall the stone be bruised / that it
may avoid without hurt. And when it auoydeth now from him / then let him eat
both in the morning and evening upon a slyce of bread the sede of Persely / and
Grummel or Graye mill made to fine powder: but the bread must be dipped or wet
before in wine. Herewyth is the stone hindered to grow any more / for it
drives it out and bruseth it. Like operation has also the blood of an Hare /
and specially when he is drouned in vinegre.

A confection for the Stone.
TAke the powder of an Hare / burnt in a pott with skin and here / so yt
nothing be taken from it: A confection for the stone
of this powder take an ounce and an hal^e / and vi. ounces of honey / and of this
make a confection. Hereof take every morning and evening as much as a chest nut
/ and ye shall find yt the stone shall break and avoid from you. But if the
rubbel or shardes of the stone do put the to pain / then use that bath / whereof
I have spoken before.

Take the rotes of Persely and herb / the herb of Fenel with the rotes / Dyll
with the roots / Smalage with the roots / of each a handful / and of each
sede a handful: chap the rotes and herbs small / and put them altogether
into a small fine linne^ bag / seth the^ well in water yt space of an hour /
and make a bath thereof / and bath therein. Then lay the bag a while upon the
back / as warm as ye can suffer it / after that upon the belly likewise:
after that sit upon the bag also as warm as ye can suffer it. And of this
wise bath in the morning three hours / at after none two hours / and at night
to bedward. Do this three days / and use to eat the rotes of Persely / and the
sede of Smalage / and the sede of Persely / of each an ounce / make powder of
the^ / put thereto two ounces of sugar / and when thou will depart from the
table / then dippe a slice of bread in wine / and strowe as much of this powder
thereon / as a chest nutte. Eat this also in the morning fasting / and to
bedward: and thus shall the stone avoid from thy without any smart or pain /
and ye shall make water easily. But beware of all things that engendre the
stone.

A good commune bath for the stone.
TAke a bushel of Walwurt chapped small / put it into a bag / and seth it in
water / bath in the same water nine days / and the stone shall sone break. But
if the stone is in the bladder / then let him lay the bag before him under
his nauel: and if it is in ye loins / then lay the bag behind at his back
/ or else where the stone greueth him: this does ease without hurt.

A bath to break the stone.
TAke six buckettes of water / put thereto two pound of Wild or Horse radish
rotes sliced small and beaten / put the^ into a bag / and seth the^ well in
water in a kettel or pot / then put altogether to the other water: but ye may
not bath to hot / another let the water pass your heart / or else should ye wax
faynte. It were good also he did drink water of Horse radice / when he bateth
/ and also before and after the bath: for that also drives out the stone.

This following is also good for the stone.
Take a kidney of an Hare / burn it to powder / braye it small / and drink
thereof in the morninge and evening / at each time half a quarter of an ounce
with Persely water / or else water of Horse radice rote. Or else take the rotes
of Horse radice cut checkerwyse / like to dice / the weight of four ounces /
pour over them a good quarte of the best wine yt ye can get / and let it
stand a day and a night: after that drink thereof in the morning and
eueninge / at each time four ounces. The Same drives out the stone in the
bladder and raynes / preserves a man from pain of the bladder and raynes /
withstandeth perbreaking. Some do dig a pott in the ground / with the Horse
radice root / the depth of a kne Or else take commun radice rotes / let them
stand in the earth / but pare of the uttermost croune next to the herb / and
make it holowe / then lay the croune again upon the root. If a water be
gathered therein / take and use the same: for it is very good for the Stranguria
/ and for them that do make their water with difficultye and droppinge / but
specially for the stone in the bladder.

A good true medecin for the stone / which is good and approved for commune
people.
TAke the berries of Iuy / beat them to powder / and drink thereof in the
morninge and eueninge / at each time a quarter of an ounce with an ounce and an
half of wine. This has driven from women stones as big / some as a dowes
egg / some as Walnuttes / some as chastnuttes / some as fylberts or smaler /
and that with pain and trauayl.

Another true science for the grauel / when one drinks thereof in the morninge
and evening at each time an ounce / or an ounce and an half.
TAke the husks wherein Beans have grown / and burn them to ashes: of
the same ashes make a lie / and drink it as is said before.

Planteyne sodden in wine / and drunk / draws out the stone / and auoydeth
the disease of pissinge / called Dysuria / being sodde^ in a little bag / and
laid warm upon the belly.

Of Agues / and first how he may be cured that is overtaken with Ephemera.
Ephemera is a fever so called / because it is apt to be cured in one day /
but if it is not regarded / turns to sundery kinds of agues or fevers. This
disease happens sometime of the Son heat / whereby the head waxes hoter
then any other members. Sometime comes it of excess of cold / and then
becomes a man redish under his eyes / and his body waxes cold outwardly /
and the head heavy. Sometime comes it with surfettinge with meats or drinks
that be hot or cold / and thereof waxes his urine reed. Sometime happens it
of anger / and then waxes his face reed / and his eyes draw forward / and
turn very swyftlye in his head. Also does it happen by heaviness and great
perplexitye and aduersitye / and then do his eyes syncke in his head / and
looks grimly / and his body waxes feeble / and his pulse beats fayntly.

When the ague comes by the Son heat / then set the pacient a little in a
blood warm bath the second / or at the last the third day / that he do sweat
therein: After that set him in a cool place / and there strowe leaves and
branches of Wylowes / and stype Myrte beries in oil of Violettes / and struck
the same oil into his nose thrilles / and take oil of Roses and vinegre of
like quantity / beat them well together / and anoynte his temples and for
head therewith / and the wrestes of his hands and fete. Give him to drink milk
of Poppy sede / made of this wise: Put water to ye sede / then beat it / and
mix it with water / yt it become like an almond milk / and strayn it through
a cloth into a glass / and give him it to drink when he will go to bed / in
the morning and in the day time a good draught. Ye must also cool him first:
and when he is otherwhyles thyrsty / give him bread stiped in cold water to
eat / and he must beware of all such things as may chafe him / if he drinks
wine / let him alaye it well / or let it be sour.

If the ague comes or is caused by cold / and that the pacient begins to
consume / then set him above a tobbe with hot water / wherein are sodde^
Camomille flowers / Dyll and Basil: put also of that water into a pot / and let
the pacient receive the vapor of it into his body beneth and at the mouth. Or
else set him in a tobbe with the foresaid herbs / that were better for him: Or
else make him a bath with the forsaid herbs / and let him warm himself well /
after that anoint him well with oil of Dyll / for the same is good and
convenient for him.

If the ague comes by heaviness or mourninge / or a dry occasion / then set
his fete in warm water / until his knees / wherein is sodden Camomill and
Dyll / of each two handful / and cover the tobbe well / that the vapoure may
stryke well into his body / as is said before / and through the mouth. Let his
legs also be rubbed dounwarde / for that does him much good / after that let
him walk / or use some other convenient exercise: he must also beware for
taking cold / and eat meats yt warm him moderatly / and be good of digestion
/ he must also beware of eating and drinking vnmeasurably.

If the ague is caused of hot meats or drinks / then give him Oxizacra with
milk of Poppysede or Sorell.

When the ague begins to fail / then give him the second or third day to
drink water distilled out of ye roots of broad Planteyn / three morninges one
after another / at each time an ounce and an half / or two ounces / and make him
an Epithema / that is a medicine upon the liver of this wise: take two ounces of
Endive water / an ounce of water Cicory / and half an ounce of water of Roses /
mix these together / and dippe towe of Hemp therein / and lay it upon the
liver. Let him also eat meats of good digestio^ as are young Mottons / Lambs
/ Chyckens / Hogs fete / and such like. Let him eschew salt meats / and be
sobre in eating and drinking: and after meat let him use moderate walkinge or
stearing / where good air is / and so shall he recover easily and well.

If the ague is caused of heaviness or great aduersitye or distress / then
must the grefe be taken away with frendlinesse and good conversation with
mirth and such pastimes and recreations / as may rejoice him / and not long
remain in one place / but let him abide where good air is / and use to bath
sometime. After yt he has rested / and will cloth him / then anointe him with
oil of Roses or oil of Violettes. Let him wash sometime in warm water / and
when he will cloth him / then anoint him as before. Let him also be chaste / and
his meats and drinks of good digestion / that do also mollify and cool him.
He may not use strong drinks / but Barley water to bedward / the same
mollifieth and cools him: hot meats do hurt him.

Of the hot and fervent ague / called Causon.
FEbris caustica is / when the Colera perishes in the veins that are near
the heart / and them that are above in the stomach / liver and lights or
poulmon. It is caused of a fervent heat / and the pacient has exceeding heat
and thyrste. This disease is of two sorts: ye one is of a single Colera / the
other ouertaketh most chefelye ionge folk / when their body is dry. When
their urine is scommy / then be sure / that they are costiffe and bound about
the heart / and get a great disease and pain in the head. The urine of them
both is reed / and they wax feeble. Ye must purge and cleanse them with pills
or laxatine / but they must be mollified before with syropes of Violettes / or
syropus acetosus / and with Electuariu^ de succo Rosarum / or Diaprunis
laxatinus / so yt they be strong enough / or yt ye age do not hinder the^ / if
he has much unclean matter in him. If he be greatly thyrsty / the^ give him
otherwhyles Po^granates or sorel to suck / and to bedward give him to drink
syropes of Violettes or Roses / with as much cold water: like wise do at none
and in ye morning / and he must beware of such things as chafe him: he must
also be let blood in ye liver vein. Let him drink wine / and alaye it well
with water. His meat must be meats of good digestion and cooling / another
eat more then need requires.

If his belly is bound / then lose it with Cassia fistula / syropes of
Violettes / and Endive water: make him a clister with ye juice of Branke vrsine
/ Trifle / herb of Violettes and Malowes / without the age / the time / the
strength or the region or country do hinder the.

If he has pain in ye head / the^ make him this sointment / and anoint his
temples and forhead therewith: take oil of roses / the juice of Porcelain /
vinegre / of each an ounce / beat the^ well together / and when ye will use it /
beat it again / and make him a plaster thereof upon the forhead and temples.

Take read Saunders / Roses / Barley meel of like quantity: put thereto as much
Rose water / that ye may mix the other things therewith / and make a past
thereof / and put the juice of Gourd thereto if ye can get it: This alayeth the
pain sone and well. Or else take Poppye sede / and beat it very well / temper
it with water / and give him always a little thereof to drink / and specially
in the night: and wett a linen cloth therein / and bind it upon his forheade.

But if he can not sleep / the^ take Lettice sede beaten / Almondes beaten / ye
juice of Lettice / of each an ounce / water of Roses / oil of Roses / of each
half an ounce / mix these very well together like a plaster / and bind it
about his head: and when it is dry / then wett it again / and he shall fall
to sleep. And if the pain go away / then give him to eat Gourdes and
Porceleyne / and when he will go to bed / then let him wash his fete in warm
water / and rub his legs well beneth dounwarde / and afterward renche them in
cold water. After that let him lie down / and leave his fete uncovered / and
so draws the heat out dounwarde: Let him do to his hands likewise.

If he waxes faint in the night for heat / then take water of Roses / and
half so much vinegre / in the same wet two clothes / each so much as a fyst /
and give him the^ in his hand / till they wax hot: the same draws out all the heat. Rub the soles of his fete therewith also and his wrestes / for it
gives him good strength. Give him confecte of sugar in his mouth / or else
confecte of Cheris / or of sour Plummes / the same slake his thyrst.

If a woman were diseased hereof / and were big with child / the forsaid
medecin might be given her well enough without danger. But if one were thus
diseased / and a yexing took him / or a gout / and it lasted four and twenty
hours or more / that is a sure token of death.

Of chylderen diseases.
MOrbilli and Variole is a disease that noyeth children greatly / called Pockes
and Masers. They that have the Pockes / if ye give them water wherein Rue or
Herb grace is sodden with Fumitorye to drink / it does help them without
dout. Great inconvenience get children with these diseases / and specially the
Pockes: for they straye over all the body / and the eyes also / and when their
eyes do itche / they wax lightely blind thereof. If ye will save them that they
ware not blind / hang the roots of Rue and Scabiose at their neck / and
they shall be safe.

Of the daily ague or fever quotidiant.
THe ague or fever that takes a man every day / is caused of Flegma / when
it falls into the blood and veins / the^ does the ague shake one / and the
cold is great. But when it is without the veins / then has the pacient cold
every day / and the shakinge nor frost is not so great. This ague have most
communly aged folk / and such as are cold or moist of complexion. It takes
them also chefely / that are idle / and use excess / and specially them / that
eat or drink out of season / wherewyth engendre within them many cold humors.

When the pacient is very thyrsty / and his body is dry / then is his ague
caused of salt flegma / wherefore give him such things / as draw out moystnes
/ and set his fete in warm water / wherein are sodden Dill and Camomille: and
when his fete are dried again by themselves / then take salt and oil of
Violettes / of like quantity / and rub the soles of his fete therewyth. He
must be purged also with such medecines / as purge flegma: for if the pacie^t is
diseased by the flegma / then is the disease more durable.

He that has the daily feuor or ague / another can be quit of it / the same is a
token / that he has corrupt blood in his back. To ease the same / were it
good to set horseleches to his back / his legs and arms near to his hands.

A good drink for the daily fever.
TAke the barks of Miscelden growyng upon oaks half a quarter of an ounce /
give him yt beaten to powder to drink with a quarter of an ounce of Aqua vite /
while the shaking is upon him: A good drink for the Quotidian or daily fever.
the same drives away ye iaundis from him / and also the whirling in the head.
Wherefore says Hipocrates: he yt makes Miscelde^ to powder / and takes it with
Aqua vite / the same drives away ye daily fever / or else ye iaundis / ye
whirling in ye head and the fever Hectica / that is / asatled fever or ague /
wherewith men do whyrle and be dismade.

The Tertiane or third days fever comes of the heat of the liver / the
Quartane or fourth days fever comes of Melancoly / ye color of his urine is
like water and clear. But the color of the Quotidiane or daily fever is most
part reed and clear. The color of the Tertiane urine is reed and thyck.

These vrines have most part a little some in the circle like Percely: But the
some of the Tertiane / yt comes of ye liver / is something yalowe / because it
comes of the heat of the gall. His mouth is bitter / and his face reed
colored / his urine is thin. Anoynte his head with oil of Roses and vinegre
mixte together.

This following is also very good against ye daily fever: Take Euphorbium made
to powder the sixtenth part of an ounce / tempered with an eggs shell full of
Aqua vite / give the pacient this three days together to drink in the morning
fasting: the same purges the slyme / whereby the ague has his nourture. This
slyme may be voyded of this wise also: Take the rote of an Elder tree / wash it
well and clean / then pare the upper shell softly from it / after ye shave of
yt other shell until ye wood or hardness / a quarter of an ounce / bray yt small
/ beat it with an eggs shell full of Aqua vite / and give it ye pacie^t. Or else
seth of the inner shell or barcke of Elder tree a hand full in a quarte of ale
or bier / till the half be sodden away and drink that / this is experimented.

He that hangs the root of Valeriane grene at his neck / if she wax sere /
then goes the ague from him.

He that fears / he shall get the ague / let him swalowe in three corns of
Coriander fasting / and it shall go away: and let this be done before the
ague fall upon him.

If he shall have cold with it / then is it good also to take three roots of
Veruayne / and three leaves of it / sodden in wine / and drunk before the cold
do overtake him / and he shall be quit of it.

He / whose fever comes of Mela^coly / his urine is first whyt / afterward
black / when nature begins to digest. He yt has this disease / let him eat
fresh meats / and purge him self twyse every weke with leaves of Sena tree
made to powder / and taken in the morninge and eueninge at each time a quarter
of an ounce with a peasebroth. Give him also to drink of this syroppe following
as often he will: Take a handful of Cicory roots / and a hand full of Cicorye
flowers / and two leaves of Hearts tongue / seth them with a quarte of water till
the third part be sodden away: the^ streyne it through a cloth into a pot / and
put an ounce of sugar thereto. This syrop is very good in summer / for it
cleanses the blood / and slaketh thyrste / and cools well / it mollifieth
also the hard matter / that is gathered about the heart of congeled blood /
whereof do sometime grow apostemes or consuming coughes: it drives away iaundis
also / and mollifyeth sieges that a man may the easyer have the^. But if his
head would ache / then give him pills that purge the head / as pillule de
iera picra / or pillule Cochie.

An approved science for the ague / it riddeth a man often in three days.
An approved science for the ague.
TAke the rotes of Celendine / chappe them small / and braye them while they be
grene. Take as much thereof as a walnut / steare them with a dishe full of
warm milk or wine / or with a dishe full of warm pease broth: this ought to
be done in the morninge fasting / and refrain from eating and drinkinge /
four hours after: and if he can go / let him walk upon it. The next day
give him Diacartami / half an ounce or more: but if he has great heat / then
give him Diaprunis laxatiui half an ounce or more / and if his strength can
bear it / give him half an ounce Electuarij de succo rosarum.

Signs of an ague come of Flegma.
If the fever is come of Flegma / and the pacient is aged / and the season dry
/ or yet cold and moist / and his pulse in his arm beats slackly / and his
urine is much and white / he also is greatly thyrstye: these are signs of
the ague that comes of Flegma. Give to that pacient the juice of Clarye / the
juice of Smalache / the juice of Fenell made like an Electuary. Let not the
paciente eat nor drink / while he has cold or heat. After that give him a
little meat / that warmeth measurably: the next day give him some meat good of
digestion / as small birds / and such like / let his drink be clean wine.
Or else give him Diacartami half an ounce or three quarters.

Item suppinges of Amilum made with cow milk / and a little saffron comfort
nature / and give a good color / and strengthen the pacient. Likewise may ye
make him Rice potage. If he is sore cooled and febled / the^ seth him a dish
full of Cumin / with a yolke of an egg / the same may he drink cold or warm
/ that strengthens him very well.

For the Iaundis.
HE that has the iaundis / must beware of all meats or drinckes that cool
him / for they hurt him. But if the iaundis does grieve him / then make him
this drink: Take a penny weight of beaten Saffron / and a penny weight of
Ancolye beaten also / put them into a porenger or with vinegre / and steare
them well together / put also a little wine and water to them / that it may be
thynne enough: then let it be drunk fasting / and it breaks the iaundis
without hurt.

But if the disease would differ / and the iaundis would not void / whereby
the pacie^t could have no stomach: if he be strong enough give him Rebarbara
made to powder / temper it with a fresh Peasebroth / and let him drink it
against the day break. If he has strength / then let him walk after it /
and hold a tosted piece of bread before his mouth / and fast two hours upon
it. This purges Colera an Flegma / whereof come the ague and the iaundis: or
else wydeth it the stomach above / whereby the stomach is cleansed of slyme and
the iaundis.

But if he could not do it / or that it did yrke him to take the Rebarbara /
then give him half an ounce of Diasene / the one half at night / the other
half in the morninge / and let this be beaten with a Peasebroth / or else
swalowed in with a roasted apple or sour thing / the same purges also.

But if his head did ache of cold / then anoynte his head / forheade and
tempels with oil of Camomille / and put into his nose oleum benedictum / and a
little into his ears also / and make him a foot bath with flowers of Camomille
/ the same chafeth the blood and head very well.

But if he has a moist head / then cause him to nise / and let him take the
root of Piretrum / that is Walworte in his mouth / and chawe it: the same
draws out the moystnesse out of the head / and give him Cinamo^ / Coriander
/ Zeduaria or Nutmegges to eat.

It is good also / that he that has a cold ague / which has lasted long /
wherewith a man is greatly cooled / that he (I say) be well anointed the back
/ the loins / and the belly with oil of Bays / and oil of Juniper of each
like much against a good fire / that it be well rubbed in. Do this in the
morninge and eueninge / for it chafeth the veins and wythstandeth the ague.

Another true science against the ague.
TAke the grene branches of Elder / and pill the upper shell of / and take the
next grene shell / braye it well / put half so much good vinegre thereto /
mix that together / then strain it through a cloth / and drink half an
eggs shell full thereof fasting three mornings: the same dryueth away the ague
without hurt.

An other proved science for the ague / that has lasted long / specially
when a man has gotten it of an evil stomach.
TAke also the branches of Elder / the former part / pyll the uppermost shell
sofftely of / after that shave of the grene / cut that small / and braye it
well in a mortar / put as much vinegre thereto / and braye it there with /
streyne it through a cloth in a glass / and give a patient thereof three
morninges fasting / at every time a spounful to drink / and let him fast
six hours upon it. This voyded the stomach well of the agues occasions.

He that has the disease that comes of hot blood / his head does ache / he
is hot and heavy / his temples are swollen / and his eyes stand forward. He
is not thyrstye / and in the night appear before his eyes read things / his
pulse is swyft / and in his sleep do all his veins beat sore. He that is so
diseased / ought to be let blood in the liver vein in the arm / and the next
in the right hand upon the thombe in the vein of the head / and the sixth day
between the little finger on the right hand in the heart vein / and the nynth
day in both the fete without / above the ankles / another must he let to much
blood in any of the veins. But it must be considered whether he has strength
enough / whether the age is convenient for it / and whether the season does
agree to it.

If any thing should hinder the letting of blood / then must his blood be
cooled with these things / namely with water / wherein is sodden Psylium /
that is Flewurt / and with a little milk of Poppy sede / this ought to be
given him to drink. Give him also a syrope of Violettes / and water / where
in are sodden black Cheries.

But if his belly were to hard / then ought it to be mollifyed herewyth: Take
Barley a good handful brayed / and seth it in a pint of water / put there to a
little butter / and a little salt / and a little Saunder / mixte with a little
sugar / and give him otherwhiles a slyce of bread / that has been stiped in
that water: the same mollifyeth his body and blood / another ought he to drink
any other wine / then that be sower / and well mixte with barley water. Lay
otherwhyles upon his nauel butter / as big as a bean / and lay a thin
dishe upon the same / till the butter be saked in. And if strength can bear it
/ and that it does not grieve him / then give him a purgacion with a confecte de
succo rosarum / and give him the night before syropes of Violettes / that he
may be mollifyed before / and he shall have easy sieges.

But if he has head ache / then anoint his head herewyth: Take half an ounce
of oil of roses / a quarter of an ounce of vinegre half a drame of Bolus
armeny made to powder / mix them well together / and anoint his forhead
therewyth / and his temples and throat. Then take a dish full of cold water /
and put therein as much vinegre / and wette a cloth therein / like a band of
three fingers / wringe it out / and bind it about his forhead and temples. And
take two clothes / each as big as a fyt / and wette them therein also / and
give him always one in his hand / till it wax dry. Wette yet two clothes
therein / and bind them about his fete: and when they are dry / then wet them
again. This cools the blood / draws out the evil heat / whereof comes
the headake. But if the headake will not go away / nor aswage / then mark by
his urine and all his beaucoure / whereof it comes him / and use theselfe
toward him / as is taught severally before of the head ache.

It is to be noted / that if the head ache comes of the stomach / then is he
more disquiet after meat then before: Him may ye help of this wise: Purge
his stomach with a laxatiue / after yt must he be measurable with eating and
drinkinge / according to his complexion. But if the headake be because the
pacientes brains are to moist / then is he more unquiet fasting then after
meat. If the moystnesse of the brains is of cold / then give him somthynge
that warmeth the stomach measurablye / and the pacient must beware of all
things that cool / and must keep his head warm.

An experimented science for the fever quotidiane or daily fever.
TAke the best Aqua vite that ye can get / half a pound / put therein the
whytest ma^y of Walwurt that ye can get two ounces / lest it stepe there in
three days / and give the paciente thereof to drink. But mark well / if it
would chafe him to much / then temper him the drink with a little other wine
/ or drink / and give him sometime Manus Christi.

A medecin for many kinds of fevers or agues.
First prepare such a draught: Take cleansed and washen Barlye two ounces /
black Ciche peasen an ounce / Licorice pared small an ounce / grene or seer
Fenell a handful / three or four leaves of Hertes tongue / two or three leaves
of Wormwood / two or three rotes of Pimpernell: let all this be sodden in three
quartes of water / till the barley does swell / and if the water does consume in
sething / then pour more water in to it / so that there remain about two
quartes and an half of water. After that streyne the water through a cloth /
and keep it. Of that water must the pacient drink both day and night when he
is thyrstye / save only wha^ he looks for the shakinge: for then must he
nether eat nor drink / without great necessity constrayne him. And when the
water is failed / then make more.

How a man shall behave himself that is thus diseased.
OF this wise must he guide himself that is diseased of this sycknesse: How
the diseased of a Fever shall behave himself.
he must beware of chese / milk / porke and fresh befe / of all fruit new or
old. Let him eat potages made with Bethes / Spinach / Oetmeel / Barley / and
always put a few Almondes beaten thereto: on flesh days a quarter of an Hen
/ or Chikens sodden in water / with Percely / and four leaves of Lettis. He
must beware also for moist meats and surffettinge. On fish days let him eat
Crabbes or Perches / sometime an egg potched in water. Let him drink no wine /
without it be at meal times / and that soberly / and mixte with ye aforesaid
Barley water / or clean water / if the made water were against his stomach: but
out of meal time let him drink none other water nor wine / then the aforesaid.

When a man knows that he shall have the ague / if it is at after none / then
may he eat somewhat in the morninge about six of the clock / and tarry so /
till the heat has forsaken him. If it shall come before breakfast / then let
him not eat / till the heat be past.

Some agues there be / in the which it were good to let blood after the third
day / according to the pacientes strength / and the season.

This is now spoken of the commune agues / and of the Tertiane or third days
fever / though there be many kinds of it.

If a man has used such water / as is spoken of before / then let him beware
of excess of meat / and take fasting the herb / or the herb made to powder
/ called Centaurea / in English Centory / the bigness of a walnutt or chest
nut / tempered with wine / and he may drink a little wine upon it / to tempere
his mouth of the bitterness. And thus may he remain that day. In the
morninge / and the two days following / let him take thereof in the morning the
bicknesse of half a Walnutt / with three leaves of Rue or herb grace / and as
much Triacle / as a pease / and must drink upon it water of Celendine / mixte
with the water of white thystle / called in Latin / Carduus Marie / or else
water of Celendine alone two ounces. After the third day let him take of the
foresaid powder again / whether he be amended or not / and use it four days
continuallye / and behave him self in dietinge / as is said before: and it is
to be hoped that he shall recover / or else shall the agus turn to another
kind of fever.

Of the Quartane / that is fourth days Fever / which can scarsely be healed.
THe dietinge and ordering in eating and drinkinge specified before / must be
considered / and then mark what time the cold shall come: for the Quartane
comes not equaly / and vexes a man sometime more / sometime less / and then
does it rest two days. When ye know the hour of the assaultinge / then take
of this drink following: Take Fenel a handful / three or four leaves of
Wormwod / seth these in half a pint of wine upon a soft fire / till the third
part be sodden away. Then take it from the fire / but let it remain warm.
And when a man perceyueth the assaultinge of the ague / then let him not rest
/ but either walk / or cause him be led with the arms. In the foresaid wine
ought to be put half an ounce of honey of Roses / and then drink a little glass
full thereof / and walk and steare him self without ceasynge / so long he can
/ ye if need is with the stay of other / so long till the cold minisheth.
Then let him lie down / and be well warm covered / that he do even sweat /
and sleep if he can / which he might happily do with werrinesse and
faintness. When ye heat is gone then let him rise / and take meat if he
lists: if not / and that he thyrsteth / let him drink of the foresaid water
in the morning / and he shall amend / and get a stomach.

Communely when men have drunk the foresaid drink / then have they the ague
more fervently then before: but let no man be afraid therefore / nor desist /
before he has taken it five times. For he falls to an amendment and
lightening / save the first day / without he do misguide himself / as is
said before.

A drink for the Quartane.
Take cleansed Barley half a pound / reed Chick peasen half an ounce / the herb
of Fenel and Maiden heir / of each a dram / ye leaves of Hertes tongue / Rue
and Wormwood of each a dram / Licoris a quarter of an ounce or a drame: seth all
these in a pottel of water / so long / till a pint is sodde^ away. Then
strain that water through a cloth / and keep it. Secondely put three pintes of
water to the forsayde things / and seth them till the Barlye wax gross / and
then streyne it again. Thyrdly take again three pintes of water / and seth it
again till the barley do burste / strain it again as before: then put all
the waters together / and give the paciente thereof to drink when / or how
much he will.

Item three days ought he to drink every morninge a little glass full of the
foresaid water / and a little Triakle / either with or without the water / as he
can bes^ ^ake it.

If that will not help the pacient / then take this following / and make him a
drink of it: Take the herb of Fenel half a handful / wormwod half so much
/ seth them in strong white wine / till the wine be half sodden away. Then
streyne it through a cloth / and put it into the same so much honye of Roses as
ye will. Of this wine ought the pacient drink a little glass full / before the
ague comes upon him / and walk upon it as long he can. After that let him
lie down and cover him warm / that he may sweat. But he must beware that
he eat not four or five hours before the sickness do overtake him.

Auicenna in the fourth book de cura Fabrium / says generallye / that him
that has the ague coming of the gall / may be ministered cold water: A commun
rule for agues coming of the gall.
for it does help to digest an consume the gall. But such water ought to be
ministered in due season / when he is in good temper / that is / nether to hot
/ nor to cold. Galen says that a dram of Centory made to powder / and taken
with white wine three morninges fasting / causes good digestion. It is good
also for costyffnesse and old coug^es / as says Platearius.
