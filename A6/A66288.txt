WILLIAM R.

WHereas Their Majesty's having a deep and serious Consideration of the War in
which they (together with most of the Princes and States of Europe) were and
still are engaged against the French King, did by Their Royal Proclamation,
bearing Date the Four and twentieth Day of March last, Appoint a general
Monthly Fast to be kept throughout this Kingdom, for Imploring the Blessing and
Protection of Almighty God in the Preservation of Their Majesty's Persons, and
in Prospering Their Arms both at Sea and Land, which has been observed
accordingly. And forasmuch as it has pleased Almighty God of his Infinite
Goodness in Answer to the Prayers humbly and devoutly Offered up to him, to
preserve Their Majesty's and Their Government against the Designs and Attempts
of Their Open and Secret Enemies; To give Their Majesty's a Great and Signal
Victory at Sea against the French Fleet; To Protect His Majesty's Person from
the many and great Dangers of the War in His late Expedition beyond the Seas;
To Disappoint and Defeat the Barbarous and Horrid Conspiracy for taking away
His Sacred Life by Assassination; And to bring Him back in Safety to this
Kingdom: Their Majesty's therefore Adoring the Divine Goodness and duly
Considering that such Great and Public Blessings do call for Public and
Solemn Acknowledgements, Have thought fit, and (with the Advice of Their Privy
Council) do hereby Appoint and Command, That a General Thanksgiving to Almighty
God for these his Mercies be observed throughout Our Cities of London and
Westminster and elsewhere within the weekly Bills of Mortality, on Thursday the
Twenty seventh day of this Instant October; and in all other Places throughout
this Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of Berwick upon Tweed, on
Thursday the Tenth day of November next ensuing. And for the better and more
orderly Solemnizing of the same, Their Majesty's have given Directions to the
Most Reverend Archbishops, and Right Reverend Bishops of this Kingdom, to
Compose a Form of Prayer suitable to this Occasion, to be Used in all Churches
and Chapels, and other Places of Public Worship, and to take Care for the
timely dispersing of the same throughout their respective Diocesses, And Their
Majesty's do strictly Charge and Command, That the said Public day of
Thanksgiving be Religiously Observed by all Their Loving Subjects, as they
tender the Favor of Almighty God, and upon Pain of Suffering such Punishments
as Their Majesty's can justly inflict for the Contempt or Neglect thereof.

Given at Our Court at Kensington, the Two and twentieth Day of October, 1692.
In the Fourth year of Our Reign.
God save King William and Queen Mary.
