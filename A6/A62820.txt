To the Right Honorable, the Lords of His Majesty's Privy Council of the
Kingdom of Scotland: The humble Petition of many Noblemen, Barons, Burgesses,
and Ministers thereof, presented at Edenbrough the last of May, 1642.
Most humbly shows,
THat Whereas they upon the report and sight of great Convocations, suddenly
indeavored and unepexctedly brought in to this Great Counsel day, for the most
part by those who have been esteemed by the Country, and challenged by the
Parliament, as Incendiaries, Plotters and Enemies to the Peace of their
Kingdoms; Have occasionally conveened at Edinbrough: and having heard of
Letters from His Majesty, and Declarations from the Parliament of England,
anent the present Distractions of that Kingdom, They have reason, from bygone
experience and present presumptions, To fear the Intentions and Endevors of
those evil affected persons and their Adherents, left by their Convocations and
solicitations they take occasion of these differences, to raise Jealousy and
Division betwixt their Kingdoms.

And considering the common Interest of all the Subjects of this Kingdom, to
preserve the late peace so happily concluded betwixt their Nations, by the
Providence of God, His Majesty's Goodness and Wisdom, and the Mediation of
the Parliament of England, and so solemnly established by the late Treaty, Oath
of Parliament, public Faith, and great Seals of their Kingdoms; as in all
other points, so especially in those Articles (whereunto, the rest are called
but Prefaces) for settling and entertaining a solid Peace betwixt their Nations
in time coming, left upon any pretense they should be dashed one against
another: Wherein it is declared, The duty of the Estates, yea, of every
Subject, to convene and suppress any evill-affected persons who would raise
Arms against the Subjects of the other Kingdom, without Consent of Parliament,
as Traitors to the Estate, much more to petition against it. And wherein there
is appointed a Commission of the Estates, for the conservation of this Peace in
the Interim betwixt Parliaments: All which the Petitioners (amongst the rest of
the good Subjects of this Kingdom) did hazard their Lives and Estates to
obtain. And did demand in the Treaty, upon their dangerous Experience of the
Council of England their meddling in the Affairs betwixt His Majesty and this
Kingdom, to the engaging of the Nations in War, which is so often condemned by
the Estates of this Kingdom, in their Remonstrances, pressing that common Rule
of Equity, TO DO AS WE WOULD BE DONE UNTO, which now is, and may be retorted on
this Kingdom.

Likewise desiring earnestly, That your Lordships, in these public
Resolutions, of so great Consequence to their Dominions, may carry along with
you the Hearts and Consciences of the Body of this Kingdom; And prevent that
the Breach grow not wider by false confidences, grounded upon sudden
undertakings of any persons: As also their Natural Affection and Duty to their
gracious Sovereign, according to their manifold Obligations, and brotherly
Affection to the Kingdom of England, forcing them to pray to God, and to desire
all men, according to their Stations, to use all lawful Means, to breed and
entertain a good understanding betwixt His Majesty and His Parliament, The
surest Foundation of Greatness to His Majesty, and Happiness to their
Kingdoms.

Likewise taking to heart the dangerous Consequences to His Majesty, and to His
Dominions, if your Lordships answer, by tendering the offer of your Service to
His Majesty, against the demands, or upon the differences betwixt His Majesty
and the Parliament of England, or any other manner of way import (which God
forbid) any engaging of your selves, or of their Nations in War, or any thing
that may tend thereunto.

Therefore, In their own Names, and in Name of the rest of the Nobility,
Gentry, Burgesses, and Ministers, whose hearts do, and hands would go along
with this Petition, for preservation of Peace betwixt their Kingdoms; They do
in all humility and earnestness, petition your Lordships, in the deep of your
Wisdoms, seriously to ponder the Consequences of your answer to His Majesty
and the Parliament of England at this time; so that thereby, neither the
Confidence betwixt His Majesty and His good Subjects here, nor amongst
themselves, nor betwixt the Kingdoms (these Unions standing ever to his
Majesty's Greatness, and those Divisions to His prejudice) may be any ways
weakened, or their Peace endangered; Unto that end as your Lordships would leave
no lawful means, according to your Interest, unassayed, for begetting a good
understanding betwixt His Majesty and His Parliament, being His Greatest, and
most Impartial Council, representing the Body, whereof His Majesty is the
Head; and for removing these distractions (the continuance whereof, will ever
trouble the Peace of this Kingdom) according to your Lordships last answer; So
also, seeing His Majesty requires not that your Lordships should (neither can
your Lordships) judge of the Laws and Proceedings of another independent
Kingdom.

And the Parliament of England offers to give all Satisfaction concerning any
Message or Papers sent to your Lordships annent their Proceedings, That your
Lordships would be pleased carefully to shun all offers of Real or Verbal
engagements, either directly, or by way of Inference, without consent of
Parliament, conformed to the Treaty, which either may give any just occasion of
offense to their Gracious Sovereign, or of Jealousy to their Brethren of
England, or of discourse unto any, as if your Lordships did not observe that
former Rule of Equity, pressed by them during their troubles, TO DO UNTO
OTHERS. AS THEY WOULD BE DONE UNTO THEMSELVES, But did fall in the same faults
which your Lordships, and the rest of the Estates of this Kingdom had condemned
in the Council of England.

And for this effect, they cannot but remember your Lordships, That according
to an Article of the Treaty, there was appointed a Commission (as independent
as any other) of so many of every Estate, representing the whole Kingdom, to
prevent all occasion of Division betwixt their Kingdoms, in the Interim
betwixt Parliaments. All which they humbly represent unto your Lordships wise
considerations, and expects from your Lordships so gracious an answer as may
satisfy their present fears, and secure them from those dangers in this
Interim betwixt Parliaments, and thereby prevent all necessity of Petitions of
this kind.
