BY THE Prince of Orange, A DECLARATION.
WHereas We are informed, That diverse Regiments, Troops and Companies, have
been encouraged to disperse themselves in an unusual and unwarrantable Manner,
whereby the Public Peace is very much disturbed; We have thought fit hereby to
require all Colonels and Commanders in Chief of such Regiments, Troops and
Companies, by Beat of Drum or otherwise, to call together the several Officers
and Soldiers belonging to their respective Regiments, Troops and Companies, in
such places as they shall find most convenient for their Rendezvous, and there
to keep them in good Order and Discipline. And We do likewise direct and
require all such Officers and Soldiers forthwith to repair to such place as
shall be appointed for that purpose, by the respective Colonels or Commanders
in Chief; whereof speedy Notice is to be given unto Us for Our further Orders.

Given at Our Court at Henly, the 13th Day of December 1688. Prince of Orange.
