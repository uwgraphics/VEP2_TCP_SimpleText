A copy of the letters / wherein the most redouted and mighty prince our
sovereign lord king Henry the eight / king of England and of France /
defe^sor of the faith / and lord of Irla^de: made answer unto a certain
letter of Martyn Luther / sent unto him by the same / and also the copy of the
foresaid Luthers letter / in such order / as here after follows.

First a preface of our soueraygne lord the king / unto all his faithful and
enterely beloved subjects.

Copye of the letter / which Martyne Luther had sent / unto our said
soueraygne lord the king.

The copye of the answer of our said sovereign lord / unto the same letter of
Martyn Luther.

Henry the eight by the grace of god / king of England and of Fran^ce /
defe^sor of the faith / and lord of Irlande:
unto all his faithful and well-beloved subjects / gretyng.
IT has seemed to us always / our entirely be loved people / that likewise /
as it apperteyneth to the office and estate of a king / dilygently to procure
the te^porall wealth / and commodyte of his subjects: So does it of dewtie /
more especially belong to the part and office of a christen king / over and
besides / his labor / pain / and traueyle / bestowed upon the prouysyon of
worldly wealth and quyete for his people: far yet more fervently to labor /
travail and study / by all the means and ways to him possible / how he
may surely keep / establysshe and co^fyrme / and spyritually set forth and
forther / the hertes and minds of his subjects / in the right relygion of god
/ and true faith of Christ / by whose high prouydence and especial bounte /
they were for yt purpose / chefely committed unto his governance. For albeit
so / that our savior Christ has in his ecclesyasticall hierarchy most
ordinately set and provided / and appointed the spyrituall fathers and curates /
most especially to solycite / procure / and have in charge / those things that
apperteyne by faith or other spyrituall virtues / to the weal and salvation
of his chosen children / which ben christen men: yet is there no man but he
well wotteth / that the temporal princes / concurryng with them and setting
their hands thereto / and ouerseyng and ordering them to execute the charge /
which god has elect them to / every prince in his own realm / the matter
shall both much better and much faster come forward. The proof where of /
has euydently appeared in times past / for soon after the beginning of
Christ's church / the conuersyon of kings to the faith / breuely turned all
their realms with the^: And where the opposyte was used / there neither grace
/ virtue / nor other good work could florisshe or encrese / but always where
lacked faith / there reigned heresies / se^sualyte / voluptie inobedyence /
rebellyon / no recognytion of superior / confusyon / and total ruin in the
end. Which things / by the great wisdom of our noble progenitors well
parceyued / they have of their virtuous mind and princely courage / as well by
the making of good and sharp laws / requisite for yt intent / as by due
executyon of the same / not without the puttyng of their own bodies / sometime
in the adventure of bataile / done their effectual deuoyre to withstand and
repress from time to time / the pernicious errors and heresies / that else had
of lykelyhode / as well by wycclyffe / as other abhomynable heretics / ben
depely roted in this realm. And surely we for our part nothing so much
desire / as the fortheraunce of you our well-beloved people / in the honor and
service of almighty god and not only to follow and ensue ye fruitful examples
of our noble progenytours / but also to put our self in deuoyre in that
point (if we may) to pass them / especially sith there never was in any of
their times / so much need thereto / as to our great grefe displeasure and
heaviness / it is now. For we doubt not / but it is well known to you all /
that Martyn Luther late a friar Augustyne / and now ron out i^ Apostasy and
wedded / has not only scraped out of the asshen / and kyndeled again /
almost all the embres of those old errors and heresies / that ever heretyke
held sithe Christ was borne hitherto: but has also added some so poisoned
points of his own / so wretched / so vile / so detestable / provoking men to
myschefe / encoragyng the world to syn / preaching an vnsaciat lyberte / to
allecte them with all / and finally / so far against all honesty / virtue and
reason / that never was there erst any heretyke so far void of all grace and
wit / that durst for shame speak them. We therefore seeing these heresies sprede
abroad / and inwardly sorowynge so many christen souls to ron to ruin / as
has done i^ other regions / by the occasyon of such pesty lent errors /
entendyng for our perte / somewhat to set hand thereto / wrote after our mean
lernyng / a little tretyse / for the assertyon and probatyon of the holy
sacraments: In which we reproved / and as we trust sufficiently refuted and
convinced the most part of the detestable heresies of the said Luther /
contained in his abhomynable book / entytuled de Babilonica Captiuitate. For
anger and furye whereof / upon two years after / Luther wrote and sent out
against us a book / nothing answeryng to ye matter / but all reason set aside
/ stuffed up his book with only furious raylyng / which his book we
regarding / as it was worthy / co^tempned and not would vouchesafe any thing
to reply / reputyng our self in Christ's cause / not to good with a right
mean man to reason or contrary / but nothing metely frutelesse with a leude
Friar to rail. So came it than to pass / that Luther at last / parceyuyng
wise men to espy him / learned men to leave him / good men to abhor him / and
his frantyke favorers to fall to wrack / the nobles and honest people in
Almaygne / being taught by the proof of his vngratyous practyse / much more
hurt and myschefe to follow thereof / than ever they looked after / devised a
letter to us written / to abuse them and all other natyons / in such wise / as
ye by the co^tentes thereof / herafter shall well perceive. In which he fayneth
him self to be informed / that we be turned to the favor of his sect. And
with many flateryng words / he laboreth to have us content that he might be
bold to write to us in the matter / and cause of the gospel: And thereupon
without answer had from us / not only publysshed the same letter and put it
in print / of purpose that his adherentes should be the bolder / under ye
shadow of our favor / but also fell in deuyce with one or two leude persons /
borne in this our realm / for the translatyng of the New testament in to
English / as well with many corruptions of that holy text / as certain
prefaces / and other pestylent gloses in the margentes / for the advancement
and setting forth of his abhomynable heresies / entendynge to abuse the good
minds and devotion / that you our derely beloved people bear / toward the
holy scripture / and to enfect you with the deedly corruption and contagious
odor of his pestylent errors. In the aduoydynge whereof / we of our especial
te^dre zele toward you / have with the deliberate advise of the most
reverend father in god / Thomas lord Cardynall / legate de Latere of the sea
Apostolyke / Archebysshop of york / primate and our Chancellor of this
realm / and other reverend fathers of the spyritualtye / determined the said
corrupt and untrue translatyons to be bre^ned / with further sharp correction
and punysshment against the kepars and reders of ye same / rekenyng of your
wisdoms very sure that ye will well and thankfully parceyue our tender and
loving mind toward you therein / and that ye will never be so gredy upon any
sweet wine / be the grape never so plesau^t / that ye will desire to taste it /
being well advertised yt your enemy before has poisoned it. Over this / where
as we before had intended / to leave Luther to his lewdness / without any
further writynge: yet for the frustratyng and aduoyding of his malycious fraud
/ whereby he entendeth to abuse the world / with a false opynion of our favor
toward him / we let not efte sons / to write him an answer / of his more
subtyle / than either true or wise writynge. After which letter written and
sent him / sith we parceyued and considred farther / that he had by so^drie
false inventions / labored to sow some of his venomous seed among you /
our well-beloved people / and has besides that / sought the means to make you
believe that he were untruly spoken and written of / and that he is not married
/ nor that he does not write or teache such execrable heresies / as men
report yt he does / which him self knows to be of such a sort / as your
good christen ears would abhor to here: And for yt cause / would for a
beginning / till he might enter in farther credence and favor among you /
bring you in the mind / by the mouths of some that set forth his matters /
that he were neither such man as he is made / nor says such things / as men
says he does.

We therefore our well-beloved people / not wyllyng you by such subtle means /
to be disceyued or seduced / have of our especial favor toward you /
translated for you / and given out unto you / as well his said letter written
to us / as our answer also / made unto the same: By the sight whereof / ye may
partly parceyue both what the man is in him self / and of what sort is his
doctrine: which two thiges / if ye well pondre / ye shall soon understand
his doctrine so abominable / yt it must needs make the man odious / and show
him to be naught were his lyueng in appearance never so good / and the man him
self of his lyueng so openly naught and vycious / that his open vices and
boldly bosted wretchedness / must needs make his doctrine suspected: And
though it bare as fair a visage of holiness / as it now bears a shameless
open face / of bold presumption in sin / far over large / and in myschefe
to great and wide sprede / for the good vysar of Euaungelyke lyberte to cover
it / but not / as he would that you should understand it: which things by
your wysedomes / our well-beloved people ones parceyued / as in this little work
I verily trust ye shall / I dout not but your goodness shall with gods
grace / take such fruit thereby / as shall be to the confort of your souls / to
the rejoice of all good men / to the let of his myscheuous purpose / and to
your eternal joy here after: And if you do (as I trust verily ye will) not
desca^t upon scripture / nor trust to much your own commentes and
interpretatyons / but in every doubt that shall insourge / learn the truth and
enclyne to the same / by the advice of your pastoral fathers of ye soul / it
shall not only encorage well learned me^ to set forth and translate into our
mother tongue / many good things and virtuous / which for fear of wrong
taking / they dare not yet do: but also that ye / by the good use thereof /
shall take much good and great spiritual profit / which thing in you
parceyued / shall give occasyon that such holy things / as yuell disposed
persons by false and erronyous translation corrupted / deliver you to your
immynent paryll and destruction / good men and well learned may be parcase in
time coming the bolder / truly and faithfully translated / substancyally
viewed and corrected / by suffycient authorite to put in your hands / to
your inward solace and gostly conforte / to the full extyrpation of all
seditious errors / increase of your devotion and charitable faith to god /
establysshment of gods grace / and favor toward you / and thereby good
works with your dilygent endeuer more plentuously springyng in you / your
sins remysed and forgyuen you by his mercy: ye shall not only in heuyn
attain those inestimable rewards / yt your merytes can not of their own
nature / but of his lyberall goodness / with virtue of his passion deserve /
but also by your good prayers and intercessyo^s / lyueng virtuously in the
laws of god / and this realm cause sooner universal peace in christendom /
to ensue and follow: which thing in earth should be most desired of all true
christian men next after heaven / to which place of joy our lord send me with
you / where I had lever to be your servant / than here your king.

Valete.
The letter of Martyn Luther.
Unto the most mighty and noble price / lord Henry the.viii. king of England
and of France / his most benign lord. GRace and peace in Christ Jesus / our
lord and savior. Amen.
Not withsta^dyng most noble king / and excellent prince / yt I ought of reason
to be afraid / tatte^pt your highness with letters / which am well knowing
unto my self / yt your highness is most grievously displeased with my book /
which I not of mine own courage / but by the instygation of them that did not
well favor your highness / folisshely and hastily set forth: nevertheless
/ I have good conforte and stomach to write / not only because of that your
kingly cleme^cy / which is daily so much told of unto me / both by words
and writing / of very many men / that seeing you be your self mortal / I can
not think you will bear enemyte immortal: but also for as much as I have by
credyble persons ben informed / that ye book made out against me in the name
of your highness / is not the kings of England as crafty Sophisters would it
should seem: which / when they abused the name of your highness / co^sydred
not in what peril they put them selves / by the sclaundring of a king / and
especially above other / that monster and common hate of god and men / the
car-Cardynall of york / that pestylence of your realm: Wherefore / I am now so
sore ashamed / that it yrketh and abassheth me to lift up mine eyes before your
highness / which have suffered my self to be with such lyghtnesse moved
against such and so great a king by those works of wickedness / namely
being my self but dregs and a worm / which had ought only by contempt /
to have been either ouercomyn or let alone: Also an other thing is / which
seriously caused me being never so vile / yet for to write / because your
highness begins to favor the gospel / and wexe not a little weary of that
sort of ungracious folks. Verily that was gospel in deed / that is to say /
glad tidings unto my heart: wherefore I prostrate my self with these letters
/ unto the fete of your highness / as humbly as I can deuyce / and beseech for
the cross and honor of Christ / that your highness would vouche safe to
enclyne some thing / and pardon me / in whatsoever I have offended your
highness / like as Christ prayed and commanded us also / one to forgive
another his dettes: Moreover / if your highness think it not to be refused /
that I make out another book / and therein unsay my former writynge / and now
on the contrary side / honor the name of your highness / please it your
majesty to give me some mylde token / and there shall be no taryenge in me / but
I shall do it most gladly / for though I be a man of no reputation / in
comparison of your highness: yet might we trust that no small fruit should
grow unto the gospel and the glory of god herby / if I might have lyberte to
write in the cause of the gospel / unto the king of England. In the mean
season our lord en increase your highness / as he has begone / that you may
with full spyrite / both obey and favor the gospel: and he suffer not your
regal ears and mind to be holden with the mischeuous voices of those
mermaydes that can nothing / but cry yt Luther is an herityke: and it may
like yor highness to consider what harm can I teache / that teaches none
other thing / but that we must be saved by the faith of Jesus Christ / son
of god: which for us suffered / and was raised again / as witnesses the
gospel and the epystols of the apostels / for this is the heed and fou^datyon
of my doctrine: upon which aftwarde I build and teache charity toward our
neighbor / obedyence unto the heedes and rulers of countrees / and finally to
crucifye the body of sin / like as the doctrine of Christ commands: what
ill is in these chapters of doctrine? yet let the matter be looked upon / let it
have hearing and judgment first: why am I condemned / neither herd ne
conuycte? Furthermore / where I rebuke the abusion of popes / which teache
other than these foresaid chapiters / and not only other / but also clean
contrary / and in the mean time leaning them self upon po^pe / money their
belyes / ye / and kingdoms / principalytees / and every man's richesse /
does not the very common people parceyue this and da^pne it / and their own
selves be constrained to confess it? why do they not amend them selves and
teache well / if they will be without hate and blame? Also your noble majesty
sees / how great princes in Almayne favors my party / and thanked be god
/ would I should not be condemned / unto whose company and nombre / I pray
Christ he add and adioyne your highness / and separate you from those
tyrannes of souls. Now / what wonder is it / though Caesar and certain
princes be sore against me? Does not natyons murmr against our lord and
his Christ? As the second psalm says people study / kings of the earth
co^sppyre / and princes come together / in so much / yt it is more to be
marueyled at / if any prince or king favor ye gospel / and I desire with all
my heart inwardly / that I may ones have cause to rejoice and make
congratulatyon of this miracle in your highness / and I pray god / by whose
favor and assiste^ce. I write this letter / that he so work with my words /
that the king of England may be made shortly / the perfyte discyple of Christ
and professor of the gospel / and finally / most benign lord unto Luther.
Amen. Some answer / if it may like your highness I look after / mylde and
benign:

At wyttemburch / the first day of Septembre / the year of our lord / a.
M.D.xxv. Most humble subject unto your regal majesty / Martyn Luther / his
own hand.

The answer of the most mighty and noble prince king Henry the.viii. king of
England and of France / defe^sor of the faith and lord of Irela^de / unto
the letters of Martyn Luther.
YOur letters written the first day of Septembre / we have received the.xx. day
of March: In which ye write your self / to be sorry and ashamed / that ye
folyly and hastily / not of your own mind: but by the instygation of other /
such as little favored me / did put out your book against me / with which ye
know your self that ye have sore offended me / And therefore have cause to be
i^ dread and shame to write unto me. Not withstandyng / ye say that ye be the
more bold now to write unto me / not only because ye parceyue my benignite
such / that co^sydring my self a man mortal / I will not bear immortal
enmyte: but also for as much / as ye by credible enformation / understand
that the book put forth in my name / for the assertyon of the Sacraments was
not mine own / but fraudulently devised by false Sophisters / to mine ignominy
and rebuke / and specially by the Cardynall of york / whom ye call a monster /
odious to god and man / and the pestyle^ce of my realm: And therefore ye say /
that ye be now ashamed to lift up your eyes to me / that have of lightness so
suffered your self to be moved against such a king / which natwithsta^dynge /
ye write yt ye be forced and compelled ernestly to write unto me / because yt I
have now begone to bear favor to the gospel / which is (as ye say)
joyful tidings to your heart / wherein ye beseech god to encrese me / that I
may with hole heart obey and favor the gospel: And yt he suffer not mine ears
to be occupied with the pestylent voices of those Serenis / which can nothing
else do / but cry out that Luther is an heretyke.

ye write also / yt ye would I should consider / that there can be no harm in
your doctrine / sith ye teache (as ye say) nothing else / but only that man must
needs be saved / in the faith of Jesus Christ: And yt upon this foundation / ye
bylde charity to your neighbors and obeydience to your governors / with the
crucifyeng of ye body of sin: And in these ye desire to be herd / much
marueyling that ye be condemned vnherde and vnco^uyct: Than after your
accustomed manner / ye rail upon the church of Rome: bostyng yt many princes
of Almayne take your part / and that it is no marueyle / though the Emperor
and some other princes and people pursue you / but rather were it wondre that
any would hold with you / for asmoch as always princes and people be (as ye
say) enemies to Christ: wysshinge / that ye might ones se that miracle / that
by god worki^g with your good words / I might be fully turned to be one of
those that might favor the gospel / and be a favorer of yours: Requyring and
besechyng me in diverse parts of your letter to pardon you / that ye have
offended me by your book / and offrynge your self / if it so stand with my
pleasure / that ye will write and put out another book to my praise /
recantyng and reuokyng all such words / as ye have in your other book written
to the contrary / affyrming also / that no litell fruit were like to grow
thereof / if ye might have leave / at liberte to write to ye king of England /
concerning the gospel of god. These be Luther all things / which were in
your letter contained: In which / as we right well perceive your covert
fraudulent purpose / so shall we on the othersyde / after our accustomed
playnnesse (lest your crafty ways might abuse good simple folk) to every
point give you true and open answer.

where ye write / ye be ashamed of your book written against me / I am not very
sure / whyder ye say true therein: but of one thing I am very sure / that ye
have good cause to be ashamed / not only of that book / but also of a great
meyny mo than that / they being such as they be: nothing else co^tayning / but
errors and heresies / neither by reason nor learning proved / but only by
shameless boldness affyrmed: Alowyng your self / to be as good or better
author / than any before your time has been / or be now. And as touching your
book written against me / who so solycited or provoked you to put that forth /
rather seemed to have be^ your yuell wyller / than mine / your book being such
as the maker could thereof have but rebuke / and mine thereby be much honored:
Against which book of mine your book declared / yt ye could find no wise word
to write / nor allege author of substance against it / which thing is
enough (as I think) for the reders or hearers / to dyscusse / which of us is
in the righter faith: And although ye feign your self to think my book not
mine own / but to my rebuke (as it lyketh you to affirm) put out by subtell
sophisters: yet it is well known for mine / and I for mine auowe it: and as for
the rebuke / though ye dissimule it / yet may all the world well perceive /
how much it fretteth your stomach: that not only my work / has so highly
to mine honor ben approved of many wise and good men / but specially of that
holy see Apostolyke also / of who^ saint Hierome rekened it suffycient / that
his faith were approved / in which nevertheless / if any good thing be / I do
ascrybe it to him / of whom all goodness comes / and not to me: How beit /
this delyteth me not a little / that as simple as my book was (for I know well
enough mine own imbecillyte) yet somoche more feeble was your cause / that my
book for so far as it touched (that is to wit / the Sacraments of Christ's
church) not only clean wyped away / all that ever ye had blasphemusly written
against them before: but also / all that ever sythens ye perniciously have
written against the^ / and drove you to the writing of that furious book / by
which all the world well perceived / that ye were for anger fallen (as who
says) in a very fransy: In which book / all wit / lernyng / and honesty
forgotten: ye nothing allege but mere scurrilyte / furious babbling braulyng /
and conuytious raylyng: where as I refelled your erronyous opinyons (not
without charity and labor of your ame^dement) by effectual reason and euydent
scripture: not interpreted after mine own fantasye (as ye do by yours) but by
the old holy fathers of Christ's church / not medli^g therein / with any of
those whom ye call Sophysters / which be men in deed / good / virtuous / and
connyng: Whom ye therefore call Sophisters / because that every substa^tyall
reason / by which they confou^de your folly / ye would were enfamed / under the
name of Sophistry.

And where as your pestilent tongue is so leude / to rail upon the most
reverend father in god / the lord Legate / Cardynall of york / our chief
counsailour and Chau^celler / it greueth him little (I wot well) to be rayled
upon / with yt blasphemous to^g / that rayleth and rages against Christ's hole
church / his saints / his apostles / his holy mother / and him self / as it
evidently (as well by many parts of your pestylent books / as by the furious
acts of your faction) appears: And his fatherhode now is and shall be so much
in more cordyall favor with me / In how much I parceyue him to be the depar
in the hatered of you / or other such as ye be: whom where ye call / the
pestilence of my realm / I purpose to give you no reknynge / what manyfolde
good fruit my realm and I receive by his faithful dilygence / labor /
traueyle and wisdom: Howbeit / all other things set a part / it well
appears / that his fatherhode is in this one point / to my realm very good
and wholesome in that he conformable to my mind and according to my
commandment / studiously pourgeth my realm from the pestylent contagion of
your factious heresies: with which among / there enters some in to my Realm
right sick / out of such places as your unwholesome brethe has enfected / who^
as they have be founden / we have by the wholesome and good dilyge^ce of the said
most reverend father / not only kept of from thenfecting of our own people /
but have also with right charitable handelyng / helped and cured them: For as
for our own subjects we trust in gods help / have and shall have / little
faith in your erroneous opinyo^s / what soever hope ye be put in / either by
other ways / or by one or two Freres apostataes / ron out of our realm /
reigning in riote and vnthriftye lyberte with you / of whom we reken our
Realm so well rydde / that if there were any mo such here (as we trust there
be not many) we would ye had them to.

It is a glad tidings to your heart / ye say / that I now have begone to
bear favor to the Gospel / as though I had never favored ye gospel
before: Howbeit yt I have not so late (as ye make for) begone to love and
reverently read the Gospel / though ye list to dissymule it: yet / ye right
well perceive / by that I have all ready by the plain gospel disproued
euyde^tly / some of your pernicious heresies / whereby ye well find / that this
is not the first time that I have entermedled me with the said gospels /
wherefore wete ye well / the Gospel long has been / and ever shall be / my chief
study: as the doctrine most wholesome to every man that will / in ye study
thereof / use a way contrary to that that ye do: Which in the interpretation
thereof / use to follow your own fantastical inue^tion / against all the
world beside / contrary to the counsel of the wise man / that says: Fili
ne i^nitaris prudentiae tuae et ne sapiens uideri uelis in occulis tuis.
Son / lean not unto thine own wit / nor take not thy self for a wise man:
But as for me / I well know and knowledge / that I am unable of my self to
the understanding thereof / and therefore calling for gods help / most humbly
submit my self to the determynation of Christ's church / and
interpretations of the old holy fathers / whom his goodness plentuously
lightened with lernyng / illumined with grace / furnished with faith garnysshed
with good works / and finally / with many miracles declared their faith and
lyuenge to like him: Where ye on the contrary side / setti^g all these old
saints at naught / and villanously blasphemynge their memories / procuring the
detractyon of their honor / lest the reverence and estymation of their holy
lives should stand in your light / admit no man's wit but your own (which
only you admytte in all thing) and desendyng a manifest folly for wisdom / an
open false heresy for a truth / have nothing else to stand by / but only
cry out that the scripture is euydent for your part: and that all that ever
took it otherwise / were but fools: Were they never so many / never so wise /
never so well learned / never so holy: And when ye have thus well and
worshipfully quitte your self in words / than instigate and set out rude
rebellyous people / under pretext of Evangelical lyberte / to ron out and
fight for your faction.

If any man had so little wit to dout / which of these two ways were the
better / yours now new begone / or the faith of the old fathers: our Savior
puts us out of doubt / where he says: Ex fructibus eorum cognoscetis eos.
By their fruits ye shall know them: For of the^ no man douteth / but they
were good men and of holy lyueng / serving god / in fasting / prayer / and
chastyte: And all their writynge full of charity / and of you / men dout as
little / when they se that all your doing began of envy and presumption /
proceeds with ra^cour and malice / blown forth with pride and vaynglorie /
and ends in lechery: And therefore / cloak ye never so much your doctrine /
under the pretexte of euangelycall lyberte: not withstandyng / that I know
how sklendre mine own lernyng is / yet is it not so sklendre / that ye can
make me believe that ye mean well / when ye speak fast of ye spirit / and fall
all to the flesh: When ye make / as ye would exhort all the world to live
after the gospel / and than exhort me^ fro chastity / to which the gospel
effectually counsayleth: and forsake your self / your vowed chastyte /
promised and dedycate to god / to the keeping and obseruaunce whereof / all holy
scripture byndeth you.

ye write that ye be ashamed to lift up your eyes to me / for that ye should of
lightness suffer your self to be so sore moved by thynstigation of yuell
folk to write such a book against me: But I much marvel in good faith that
ye be not i^ ernest ashamed to lift up your eyes and look / either upon god or
good man / that have suffered your self by the deuyls instigation / to fall in
that lyghtnesse of wit / that for the folly of your flesh / ye being a Friar
have taken a Nonne: and not only vyolate her (which if ye had done among the
old Romans that were paynyms / she should have been buried quick / and ye
beaten to death) but also which much worse is / have openly married her / and by
that menes openly abuse her in sin / with ye wonder of the world and
abhomynable contempt / as well of the sacrament of Matrimonye / as of your
both vows of chastity. And that worst is of all / where ye should be ashamed
and sorry for this heinous deeds / instead of repentance ye take therein pride
/ and so far be fro the desire of forgyuenesse of your own sin / that ye by
your books / exhort other unthrifts thereto.

And in this doing / it is no marueyle / though ye would that men had no
reverence to the old holy fathers. For who so believe yt they were good / must
needs parceyue yt ye be naught which both teach and do so manyfestly the
contrary of their deeds and doctrine. For who can like a freres marriage / if he
set ought by saint Hierome: for to the^ that has vowed chastity / says this
holy man Vouentibus no^ solum nubere / sed etia^ velle damnabile est.
/ it is damnable / not only to wedde in deed / but also to will or wysshe it.
Read well his Epistle written to the Nonne yt was gotten with child / and his
other to the Deacon that did that sinful deed: And therein / and in other like
letters and holy writing of old holy fathers / learn to repent your own
fautes / rather than in making books for the defense of your inexcusable syn /
to draw by your yuell example and vngratyous counsel / more wretched company
with you to the devil.

ye that so much bost your self of holy scripture / I marueyle ye can set so
little by your vow / when ye read therein this holy saying: Si qid vouisti deo
ne moreris reddere displicet enim deo infidelis promissio.
If thou have any thing vowed to god / delay not the performyng thereof: for an
unfaithful promise displeases god.

Read ye not also there these words: Vouete and reddite / dn^o deo vestro.
To your lord god make ye vows / and fulfill the^? What say ye by these
words Quum votum voueris dn^o deo tuo non tardabis reddere: quia requiret
illud dn^s deus tuus et si mortuus fueris reputabitur etia^ tibi in peccatum.
/ when thou have made a vow to thy lord god / come of and perform it: For
thy lord god will have a reknyng thereof. And if thou dye / it will be laid to
thy charge for a syn? But ye reken I trow / holy vows of fasting and
chastyte / seruyle cerymonies of Moses law / for your writing and lyueng /
seems to reken the Euaungelycall liberty of the new law / to stand in
lyueng after liking: but the prophet Isaye said / that in that time (meaning
ye time of Christ's law) they shall vow vows to our lord and perform the^
In die illa uota uouebu^t domi^o et soluent
/ she wing that vows should have in Christ's law more strength / and be
better kept / than in the old law: Whereof god showed example / when he took
vengeance upon Ananias and his wife for that they had broken their vow to god
/ i^ keeping aside some of their own money / Whereupon holy saint Gregory / as
though he might seem to speak to your le^man and you (for weddi^g was it none
yt ye were wedded with) says in this wise. Ananias deo pecunias vouerat /
quas post victus per suasione diaboli subtraxit. Sed qua morte mulctatus est
scis. Si ergo ille mortis periculo dignus fuit / qui eos quos dederat nummos
deo abstulit. Considera quanto periculo i^ diui^o iudicio dignus eris qui non
nummos sed temetip^m deo oi^potenti cui te sub monachali habitu donaueras
subtraxisti.


Ananyas vowed money to god / which he afterward ouercomen by the deuylles
enticement withdre we / but what death he was punysshed with thou know. Than
/ if he was worcester thy death / that took away fro god again / that money that he
gave him: Consydre / how great peril in god des judgment thou shall be worthy
/ which have taken from almighty god / not money / but thyn own self / who^
thou gave unto him / when thou tokest the habyte of a monk. What say ye
Luther? What says your leude le^man to this? If ye knowleged yor sin for
sin: If ye were for your sin sorry / though ye fill by fraylte yet were
there hope of amendment / as was in Mary Magdalene / Dauyd / and many other:
but now what hope is there of you / if ye persyst in the defense of your faut /
with ye bostyng of your lewdness / when ye call your vice virtue / and the
virtue vice / Fall ye not in this doing / deep in the maledictyon / that Isaye
spoke of / when he said: Ve qui dicites bonum malu^ / and malu^ bonu^ /
pone^tes tenebras lucem / et luce^ tenebras amaru^ in dulce / et dulce in
amarum.
Woe may ye be that call good yuell / and yuell good / puttyng darkness to be
light / and light to be darkness / bitter for sweet / and sweet for bitter?
Now / when ye regard all these scriptures nothing / when ye wrest them to your
unreasonable appetyte / when ye contempne the interpretations of holy fathers
thereupon / when ye set at naught their wholesome doctrine / confermed by their
virtuous lyueng: and against all these / set your own sensualyte / and with
brutall reasons / rail against all vows (so manifest and heinous an heresy /
that there neither has been herd a greatter or a more open) yet ye pray god
that he suffer not mine ears to be occupied with the pestylent voice of those
Serenys / which can no thing else / but cry out that Luther is an heretyke.
Where as I know in this behalf no greatter Serene / than your own works /
which almost cry nothing else in mine ears / than that Luther is an heretyke:
so farforthe / that I much marueyle / how ye may for shame say to me / that
ye teach no thing / but that the salvation of man must needs arise by the
faith of Jesus Christ / the son of god / that for us suffered his passion and
rose again / and that upon this foundation / ye build and teache charity
toward our neighbors / and obedyence toward the rulers / and the crucifyeng
of the body of sin.

Would god Luther / yt these words of yours were as true / as I know them
for contrary: For what charity bylde you upon faith / when ye teache that faith
alone without good works suffyseth: For albeit that in your book made against
me / waxinge for shame half weary to here thereof: ye laid to my charge / that
I did therein mysse report you / yet did ye not only make none erthly answer
to your own words / which I laid to your charge / openly proving in you /
that detestable heresy: but also said the same again in the self book / In
which ye pretend your self to have been wrongfully charged therewith before /
saying: Sacrilegium est et impietas velle deo placere per opera et non per
solam fidem.
That sacrilege it is and wickedness / to have any will to please god by good
works / and not by only faith: which words be as open / as those that ye
wrote before in Babilonyca / where ye write this sentence: Ita vides quam dives
sit homo christianus sieve baptisatus qui etiam volens non potest perdere
salutam suam qu^^tiscunque peccatis nisi nolit credere. Nulla enim peccata eum
possunt da^nanare nisi sola incredulitas / cetera omnia / si radeat vel stet
fides in promissionem diuina^ baptisato factam / i^ momento absorbentet per
eandem fide^.
Thus thou see (say ye) how rich is a christen man / or he that is baptized
/ which though he would / can not lose his salvation / by any sins / be
they never so great: but if he will not believe / for no syn can dampne him /
but only lack of believe / for as for all other sins / if there stand still
or come again faith and crede^ce in gods promise / that god made to his
sacrament of Baptyme / they be supped up in a moment by the same faith. These
words of yours show so manyfestly what ye mean / that there neither needs
nor boteth* any gloss: It can receue no color / but that contrary to Christ's
words Angusta e^ uia que ducit ad celum.
/ the way is strayte and narowe that leads to heuyn / ye / with your
Euangelycall lyberte / make a broad and easy way thider / to win you favor of
the people / teaching that it shall be enough to believe gods promise / without
any labor of good works / which is far fro the mind of saint Paul /
which teaches us a faith that works by love and also says. Si estis infide
christi uos ipsi probate.
If ye be in the faith of Christ prove you yt: which proof can not be / but by
good works: For as scripture says: Qui operatur iustitia^ acceptus est deo.
He that works righteousness / is accepted with god: And saint Johan spekyng /
against such seductours as begile men with a vain ydell and a deed faith /
says: Filioli nemo vos seducat / qui facit iustitia^ iustus est.
My children / let no man begyle you / he that justly does / he is just and
rightuous / for else to believe of your facion / without good works and boldly
to live in vice and wretchedness / with presumptuous hope / that your faith
shall suppe up all your sins it is a faith worse than deuillysshe / For as
saint James says: Tu credis quoth vnus est deus / et demo^es credu^t et
contremiscu^t. in hoc te minus mali sunt quia non times.
Thou beleuest that there is one god / so does deuylles / and trymble for
dread: In this they be not so yuell as thou / for thou fear not.

And verily / with that opinyon of your only faith / ye put away all fear
of god / when ye say that a man though he would never so fayn (how vngratius
soever his deeds be) ca^ not be damned / but if he will not believe: tha^ / if
this were true / there should no man need to fere god no manner away / neither
by fere of his iugementes nor just punishments / nor by initiall or filyall.
For what needs a man to fere god / if only believe may save him / or what
boteth a man to fear hell / or to labor for heaven / or to fear the
displeasure of almighty god / if a bare faith may save his soul. And also /
where as ye put clean away by your assertions / all fear of gods judgment
from the induction of the sacrament of penance / and would that only by love
we should attain the same / herein ye would do great wrong to all sinners /
though ye by your works pretend the^ favor / for ye would take away one of
the best means to attain ye very perfyt love of god / which love in him
self / encludeth a certain fear. And I fear me / that in the pylgrimage of
this present life / love is right syldome very sure if we set aside all fear
/ and make our self to sure: For as holy scripture says: Ad quem respiciam
dicit dn^s nisi ad humilem et quietum et timente^ sermones meos.
Unto who^ says our lord shall I look but upon an humble man and a quiet / and
him that dredeth my words / by which appears well / that without dread of
gods words / he will not look upon a man: whereunto well accords the words
of scripture / which says: But if thou hold thy self continually in the
fear of god / sone shall thyn house be subverted. Thus may ye se Luther what
so ever ye say fear may not well in this world be for borne / but if we would
have god turn his face from us / and our house over turned upon our heed /
and surely in scripture / who so that redeth shall well find that the gifts
and callynges of god / be diverse and in sondrie ways divided / among which
/ seruyle dread is one / and yet all to one end / without which medyations
and means / the sinner can not always attain at the first / that perfyte
charity that causes salvation. Wherefore what worse counsel can ye give to
sinners / tha^ to advise them to leave / those remedies and means / by which
they may be pulled from syn / and graciously drawn to god: And of truth
there is not lightly any other way / by which me^ be drawn more often / nor
yet in the beginning more stro^glye / than by that fear that is cast in to
the heart / by the deep co^syderation of the terrible pains of hell / which
thing was the very cause / for which our merciful Savior did cast that fear
before the eyes of his blessed apostels / when he said unto the^: Timete eu^ /
qi quu^ occiderit habet potestatem mittere in gehennam.
dread him / which when he has killed / has also power to cast in to hell /
and therefore wha^ this was said to ye apostels: let no man think this fere a
thing of so little weight to sely sinners / and not yet so verily penytentes
in deed / as deuisyng thereupon and going about to be. To whom / what can be
more wholesome than fear / which as scripture says / Timor expellit peccatum.
puts syn out / and Qui sine timore est / non poterit iustificari.
he that is without fear can not be justified. And ye would have fear of
gods judgment and puysshment / not only taken fro contrition / which is the
most common way yt draws men from sin: but also to the end / that men
should in sin presume upon their faith / ye would have all fear taken from
the love of god: where as holy scripture rekeneth fear a way / to attain the
love of god / for he says. Timor domini initium dilectionis.
The fear of god / is the beginning of love / ye and also thretneth (as I have
said) that except thou keep thy self continually in the fear of god / thine
house shall soon be subverted. The scripture besides this well declares also
/ how great strength fear has toward faith / when he says: Qui time^t
dominu^ no^ eru^t in creduli verbo illius / qi timent inqirent que beneplacita
sunt ei.
they that fear god will believe his word / and they that fear him / will
seek and ensertche / what things stand with his pleasure. And yet over all
this / holy scripture teaches us that wisdom / also takes his beginning of
fear / for he says: Initiu^ sapie^tie timor dn^i.
The beginning of wisdom is dread of god. Lo Luther / here ye se that fear
which ye set so little by / the holy scripture (by which ye make / as though
ye set much) joins not only with wisdom and faith but also to love /
during the time that we wandre in the pilgymage of this world / and not
without good cause For surely / when a man is by ye fear of gods judgment
withdrawn from the following of sin (which tourneth his mind from god) he is
and needs must be / the more fyt both to love god / and be beloved of him. For
which cause / the holy prophet Dauyd / parceyuing the great profit of that
necessary fear / hertely prayed god / that this fear might not only bese^t
him: but also strongly / with his grefe and pain stricken in to him / crieng
to god in this wise. Confige in timore tuo carnes meas a iudiciis enim tuis
timui.
Rote or fastyn in my flesh / thy fear / for I have been aferde of thy
iugeme^tes: so shows he / that he has not only feared gods iugementes /
but he desires also to have that dread depely fastened in in his heart. And
whereto would god have given us warnyng of hell / and thretten us therewith /
except the fear thereof should have been / as it were a bytte or a bridell to
refrain us from sin / and to bring us and preserve us in charity / and his
favor. Wherefore / sith it is euydent that ye take a way this fear / and
openly write against good works / contempnyng in penitentes all satisfaction:
How shameless are ye to write yt ye upon faith do edifye charity / when as I
have expressly proved by your own writing that ye build upon your faith right
naught but yuell works in techyng that only faith alone suffiseth and
manifestly co^tempne good works / and give boldness largely to work yuell
without fear / teaching that faith alone shall suppe up all our sins /
namely as ye defyne yor faith / where ye say Fides esse nullo modo potest nisi
sit viuax queda^ et indubitata opinio qua homo certus est super omnem
certitudinem se placere deo se deum habete propitium and ignosce^tem in omnibus
q^ fecerit aut gesserit.
that faith can not be in no wise / but if it be a certain lively and undoubted
opynion / by which a man is certain above all certaynte yt he pleases god /
and that god has him in favor / and pardons him in all that ever he does /
by which words ye command an high presumptuous faith / wylling men to reken
and account them self not only sure of gods favor / but also so highly in
his favor / that they may be bold to offend him / as though he will for
man's only faith / pardone and forgive all their fautes.

And yt such a faith will as ye wrote in Babilonica / suppe up all their
sins which faith is contrary to yt / which old doctors teache: for holy
Isodoresaith / Frustra sibi de sola fide blanditur qui bonis moribus non vtatur.
that man which will not use no good deeds does folisshly flatter him self
with a bare faith. And also saint Augustyne affyrmeth / that Fides appellata
est ab eo quod fit. due syllabe sonant quu^ dicitur fides / prima a facto
secunda a dicto. interrogo te ergo vtrum credas dicis credo fac quoth dicis et
fides est.
faith bears his name in latin of two syllables / the one belongs to the
deed / the other to the saying. I ask ye says saint Augustyne / wheder thou
beleuest or nay / thou answerest ye: than do as thou say / and than have
thou faith. But what avails to lay you the words of your auoury saint
Augustyne / out of whose order ye be run in apostasye: Whereto should I lay
you the auctorite of any of the old holy fathers / whom ye setting all at
naught / dare boldly contend and affirm that there is none other way to
faith / nor that faith is none other manner thing / but such as ye defyne
wrong / which your wrong defynition of faith / albeit ye would have it bear a
cloak / and be taken as though it were formed and perfyted with charity: yet
shall ye never make any man that knows the right faith of Christ in that
point to believe you when you make your faith care so little for good works /
and so lightly supping up all sins that it must needs give all myscheuous
unthriftiness a great audacite and boldness of ungracious lyueng / For upon the
other side the blessed Apostell says / in them that are of age the very true
faith is that / which works with love: And saint Johan also says Qui
diligit deum / mandata eius habet et seruat.
/ he that loves god / has and observes his commandments / so after both
their minds / the one of faith the other of love / ye must of necessyte (as
holy scripture says: Declyne from yuell and do good / and not to rest in that
ydell and errogant faith / by which ye think and ymagen your self sure and
certain / above all certaynte / that god is well pleased with you and either
approves or pardons / all that ever ye do: For if that were so that holy man
Job / which was of gods own mouth called so good and rightuous / that
there was none like him in the earth / would never have been so tymerous and
fearful / as to have said: Verebar omnia opera mea sciens quod non parceres
delinquenti.
I feared all my works / well wittynge that thou sparest not the sinner.

Now where ye write that faith must be lively / that grant I well / but how
ca^ it be lively without love and he loves not god / as the Euangelyst says /
that keeps not his commandments / nor he that is of age keeps not the
commandments / that labors not in good works: Whereupon it well and
consequently follows / yt your faith setting good works at naught / can in no
wise be lively / but must needs be such a faith / as saint James the apostell
reproves / where he says: Fides sine operibus mortus est.
Faith without good works is deed. Over this / if that be true that your
self affirm in your sermons of the precepts / that gods commandments /
namely the nynth and ye tenth can of no man (be he never so good) in any manner
wise be kept contrary to yt / that Christ seems to mean / where he says
Jugum meu^ suaue est et onus meum leave.
/ my yoke is soft and easy / and my burden light / but as I said / if ye say
true yt gods commandments can i^ no wise be kept / and god is not loved /
but if his commandments be kept / nor life is there non in faith / except
yt god be loved / seye not now yt of your own words ye fall again to the
first point / that faith which (as ye say) must needs be lively / ye bring it
in to such case that it must needs be deed / but your intent may facilly be
perceived: For as your works do show / ye would either yt men should presume
to believe yt faith were as an instrument to provoke men to sin / and to give
them boldness that faith shall suppe up all their sins / how great soever
they be / to the intent that men should neglect good works / and remain in
high presu^ption / which is contrary to scripture which says: O presu^ptio
neqissima vnde creata es.
O most wicked presu^ption / whereof were thou made / or else ye set it in that
high prick / though with impertinate terms / which few or none can attain
unto / bringynge in thereby men in to desperation / to ye intent that
desperation ones rooted / all care of good lyueng laid a part they should ron
out at large in to all kind of vytiousnesse / and than ye might say by them
as saint Paul says / ad Ephe. Desperantes semet ipsos tradideru^t
impudicitie in operatione^ i^mundicie oi^s in auariciam.
They dispeyringe / have given them self to lechery / and the workyng of all
uncleanness / which thing ye procure under pretense of lyberte. And also the
saying of holy Job / which says to desperate folks / Non credit frustra
errore deceptus quod aliquo precio redimendus sit.
he believes not vainly deceived by error / that he should be redeemed by any
price / whereby men may parfitely parceyue your doctrine and preaching expressly
naught / which would give to men no mean way in faith but either that /
which the blyndest may parceyue naught / or that way which the best can
skante attain / nor neither by the one way nor the other / nothing else
procure or go about / but to find the means / that either the boldness of
faith optayned / or the dispeyre of optaynynge might drive men in to a bold
lyberte of leude lyueng / which is the only thing that ye labor to bring in
custom under the name and cloak of Euangelycall fredome. And this is the
charity / that ye build upon the foundation of your deed faith.

Now where ye write / yt ye bylde upon your faith obedience toward gouernars
/ who sees not how sha^elesse an untruth ye write theri^ / wha^ there is no
man but he knows how obstinately ye teach that no christen man can be
bounden by any laws / of which the governors be ministers: And also how ye
set at naught / all the holy general counsails that ever have been of
Christ's church: For ye execusion of which / your vngratyous heresy / ye with
other detestable heretykes / brenned up the holy Canno^s with open derisyon and
rude vplandisshe people by you incensed / have risen in plu^pes against their
governors / to their own distructyon and your shame.

How can ye for shame say that ye build upon your faith the crucifyeng of
the body of syn / when ye byld upon your deed faith / the negligence of prayers
/ the vilypensyon of holidays / the contempt of fasting days / and finally
all thing in effect / which christen men by the commandment of Christ / and
ordinance of his holy church / crucifye the body of syn by.

Also how can ye say that ye teach and exhort men to crucifye the body of
sin / when ye teach that sinful heresy / that man has no power nor
liberty in his will to do any good with all: For who shall study to do any
good or care what yuell he does / that were ones thoroughly persuaded in hi^
self / yt he neither can any good thing do by himself / nor workyng with
gods grace any thing to do toward it / nor that in any yuell work his own
will does any thing at all but the necessyte of gods will works all
together / which he can neither let nor further. This heresy / the very worst
that ever was / and most highly touching the justice of god / seems to be the
very rote / whereof all other myscheuous demeanor and outrage of your
ungracious faction spri^geth / whose boldness and temeryte ye arm with the
excuse of gods ordinance / and ineuytable necessyte / and thus you would
aproue your false opinyons / setting forth and prechyng some certain places
of scripture obscurely written / extorted by you for your purpose / some clear
against you which ye nevertheless without shame co^tende that they make for you
/ wherefore I marueyle greatly (if you had either wit or shame) yt you durst
have that boldness to afferme yt abominable and unreasonable heresy against
the doctrine of so many good men / of so many wysemen / of so many co^nyng men
/ of so many holy men against the hole consent and agreement / not only of
Christ's holy church / fro the beginning thereof to this day / but also /
against all common reason of all the hole world / fro the first creation of
the world hitherto (saving that of late Wicclyffe began it before you) and
against innumerable places of holy scripture / manyfestly showing the contrary
to your opinion / whereunto ye can set no color of which sith they be so ryfe
and thick in every part of scripture / in vain were it here to bring you
many / therefore one or two shall suffyce for a sample. For what can be more
open than these plain words Proposui vobis vitam et morte^ / benedictionem et
maledictione^ elige ergo vitam vt and tu viuas et semen tuum.
/ I have set before you life and death / good blessing and maledyction /
chose therefore life that you may live / and thy progeny also: what election is
there I pray you where lyberte lacks? how stands choice with necessyte? In
likewise / where it is openly said unto man / by god putting both good and
badde punysshment / and reward in choice of man's fre will / saying thus:
Apposui tibi aquam et ignem ad quod volueris porrige manum tuam.
I have set before the / fire and water / to whether thou will put forth thyn
hand and in likewise this: Ante hoi^em vita and mors quod placuent ei dabitur
illi.
Before man I have put both life and death / wherther shall please him shall
be given him. What means here his will and puttyng forth his hand / if he
have no lyberte of choice? Whereto badde saint John^ that the jews should do
penance? Whereto badde Christ the aduoutresse that she should sin no more?
Whereto commanded he all men to keep his commandments / if men could neither
of themself perform the^ / nor with his aid and help do any thing toward
them? When god told the^ / that good and badde was put in their choice / did
god tell them a true tale or a false? if ye say that he said not true / than
take ye crede^ce from all his promyses by faith / which only credence ye say
/ suffyseth to salvation. And on the other side / if it were true / than must
ye be needs untrue that teach the contrary / so that in this matter I se none
other question / but wheder we shall believe Christ or you / except ye will say
(as I se nothing so far out of reason / but ye be ready to say it) that god
spoke it in sport / but neither is that the grave and ernest manner of his
majesty / and in this thing also he spoke marvelous ernestly / and showed them
their free liberte / as the very cause of their just punysshment / if they
brake his behest / declaryng and testifyeng his rightwyse Justice / to the end
that no man should of his goodness conceive so pestyle^t opinyon / as to
think the thing that ye now preach / which is / that his clemence has that
tyra^nous nature to punysshe any man without desert / as it were only for a
cruel pleasure. And therefore / when ye be so far fallen in to the pytte of
pestylent heresies / that ye can find in your heart to conceive that detestable
opinyon of god / which no good man can find in his heart to think of an
other / there needs none other proof to declare what ruynous buylding ye rear
upon the false foundation of your unfaithful faith.

Nor I touch not these heresies of yours for any purpose / to dyspute upon
them: For I both know the^ for such as against every one of the^ were matter
enough / not for a long letter / but for many long books: and also / for such
as be so plainly and so fully dampened / reproved / and rejected already / and
upon the bare hearing in every good man's ears so da^pnable in themself /
that they need not to be now disputed upon / nor should be disputable or
doutfull / and much less credible / although (as saint Paul says) An angel
would come from heuyn and preach them / being so contrary to the gospel and
faith / that Christ has taught his church / from the beginning hyderto. Nor
if they were as doutfull and dysputable for you / as they be undoubtedly clear
against you / yet am I long syns at apoi^t / no more to vouchsafe to dyspute
any man with you / since I have had so good experience of you / how clean ye
set all reason aside / and fall all to raylyng: For which I have determined
(which I shall surely keep) as for any dispytions / to leave you to your
lewdness / albeit other folk me think have as well of other places / as of
our own realm answered you / and somewhat handled you / as ye be worthy /
after your own facion / saving that they among plain words / tell you reason
/ where ye used only raylyng and as yet / ye answer none of them one word /
against whom ye would not so long have hold your peace / were it not that ye
perceive your self so plainly concluded / that ye could not write against them
again for shame: but and if ye hap herafter to wax shameless again for
anger / some of them I think / will not mysse yet eftsoon / Luther / ones to
show you yor self again: But as for m^ / neither purpose I to write any more
to you / nor at this time would not / ne were it that I perceive by your letter
/ your fraudulente purpose / by which ye would abuse the world / as though
ye knew me for turned to your sect: wheri^ I would have given you short answer
without any touch of your heresies in specialte / had ye not be so shameless
to write that ye teach no thing else / but that men must be saved in the
faith of Christ / with charity builded thereupon / and obedience and crucifyeng
of the body of sin / which your sha^efull and shameless lyeng / has driven
me so to show and specify one or two of your open heresies / that every man
may parceyue how far they be of another kind than the faith of our
salvation or charity / or obedience / or crucifyeng of the body of sin /
which ye say be the only things that ye teach / and yet have I nothing
touched / the great high hope of all your other heinous heresies / which yet
more plainly declare and prove your shameless untruth / in writing / that ye
teach nothing else / but the faith of our salvation / charity / obedience /
and crucifyeng of the body of sin: For when ye so plainly write against the
sacraments of Christ's church / when ye damme chastity in priests / deny all
holy orders / join breed with ye body of Christ / take from all men the
benefyte of the mass / rail against ye holy Canon of the same: when ye make
women confessors and ministers of all sacraments / and make them consecrate
the body of Christ: When ye teach so little difference between our blessed
lady and your leude Le^man: When ye blaspheme Christ's holy cross: When ye
teach that there is no purgatory / but yt all souls shall sleep till the
day of dome / that sinners may be hold for so long / with a thousa^de
shameful heresics beside / Are ye not now a shamed / to say that ye teach
nothing else / but that man must be saved by the faith of Jesus Christ? When ye
go about in deed to distroy the faith of Jesus Christ / who if he had come to
teach such ways as ye teach / he had not common to call the world fro badde
to good / nor had been a techer of virtue / as he was in deed / but a very
patron of syn / whereof the contrary / he did well show in suffryng the
punisshment of ye cross for the only redemptyon and remissyon of our sins.
How might ye for shame (if there were any in you) write unto me such things /
knowing that I not only have reed these things i^ your books / but have over
that manifestly to your open shame and rebuke / conuycted you in many parts of
the same / as substantial well learned men do judge.

All which natwithstandynge / it is wonder to se / with what boldness ye
desire to be herd / and (as though ye had never been herd hitherto) show
your self much to marueyle why ye should be condemned / neither being herd
nor co^uicted. Have ye not been herd face to face before ye popes Legate in
Almayne? Have ye not been herd in open dispytions in Saxony? have ye not ben
ouermoch herd / by your erronyous and blasphemous books over largely sprede /
through the world? and yet ye allege your self not to be herd / but
conde^pned without conuyction: ye may be safe enough from all co^dempnation /
if there be first requisyte such a conuyction / as your self will confess
for a conuyction: but of troth / ye have been conuycted often enough by sondrie
connyng men (and as wise and well learned men reken) by my writing also / which
was confermed by the approbation of the sea apostolyke / the which thing though
your pride will not parceyue / yet your dealyng does confess / sith ye never
hiderto could ne did answer thereunto / by any substantial reason / but only
by leude raylyng.

If my self knew not the matters whereof ye be condemned / yet could I no
thing dout / but ye were justly condemned / seeing that ye were condemned by
our holy father the pope and the holy college of Cardynals: whose justice and
indifference / there will no wise man any thing mystrust / for the leude
raylyng of a simple friar / angry with his own just condempnation / and
namely such as ye be / whom no reason can satisfye / none auctorite can move /
nor believe no man but your own wit / whom only ye believe in all things /
contrary to the wise man's counsel / which says: R^^^ sapiens esse apud
semetipsum.
Stand not to well in your own conceyte: And he says also / that there is
much more hope of a fool than of one that takes him self for so wise.
Uidisti hoi^em sapie^tem sibi videri: magis illo spem habebit insipie^s
When ye were also condemned by diverse vnyuersitees / and among other / by the
famous vniuersyte of Paris: why should I mistrust your condempnation: and
though I had my self (as I said) nothing known of your matter / namely sith
your self co^discended to stand and obey to the judgment of Paris / but
parceyuinge your errors so manifest / that ye could have none hope in the
judgment of any man / good and co^nyng / At your personal being at Wormace /
where ye were by the Emperors majesty conde^pned in plain parliament / ye were
/ ye said / content to dispute / but ye refused utterly upon your dispytions /
to stand to any man's judgment. Now when I se that ye order your self in
this wise / neither stand to the judges that ye condiscende upon / nor to the
judgment of the Emperor / with such nombre of co^ning men as he has and than
had about him: nor to the judgment of the Pope / and ye church of Rome / but
furiously appele from the Pope to the next general counsel / and that with a
sta^^yng hole / farther addyng / such as should next be congregate in the Holy
ghost: And yet after that / openly detracte and deny the power of all general
counsayls / whereby well appeared / that in conclusion / ye would stand to none
at all: how could I than (as I said) mistrust your condempnation: All this
your order consydred / albeit I had nothing else herd and understood of your
matter: but no we knowing your matters my self / and well parceyuinge them /
for such as they be / plain and euydent heresies / of such sort / as I have
rehearsed you so^e / as ye say ye marueyle that ye can not be herd: so I much
marueyle more that you can so say / and that any man is in those opynions
content to give you any hearing at all / as though they should now dout /
wheder those things be true or not: which as artycles of our faith / all
Christ's church believes / and has contynually believed this fyftene hundred
years before / as appears by ye doctrine of Christ and his blessed Appostels /
with many other holy doctors and saints / writynge in sondrie times consonant
in one faith / fro Christ's days unto yours / of which holy sai^tes / and
interpretours of the scripture of god / sith ye contempne their writings / I
se not by what reason ye can desire yt we should believe yours / or what fruit
could come of your writings / so clean contrary to the fruitful writing of
theirs: And therefore where ye say there were great hope of no little fruit to
the gospel / and glory of god / if ye might have leave and lyberte / to write
unto me thereof: surely / than had ye need to write clean the contrary / of
such things as ye have written already / and seem lykely to write by your
letter / for by that ye have hiderto written / the gospel of Christ has take
no fruit / but by the pestylent blast of your venomous mouth / has had much
goodly fruit utterly spilte and rotten / and many a fair blossom perysshed /
yt would have been sweet fruit / if such a catterpyller had not devoured the^.

Now where as ye rail of ye fautes of the court of Rome / and the clergy / I
purpose not with a man of your auctorite to dispute much there upon / but how
soever they be / ye show your self what ye be: and sith ye reken your self so
great a gospeller / it were well done / that ye learned of the gospel / to pull
the beme out of your own eye / ere ye spy a festue in another man's / and
that ye consydre by them that of rancour and malice rebuked Dauyd / what end
they communely came unto / that rail upon their souerayns: And that / albeit
ye should se the church so^ what swerve / that ye be not yet so bold and
malaperte / presumptuously to take upon you to set your crooked hands to the
righti^g thereof / lest god so teach you curtesy / as he taught him that set
hand to ye arche of god when it was swarued: How be it vndoubtely though ye
list to rail upon ye court of Rome / yet it well appears upon your doctrine /
and your lyueng that ye worst like in the church / what so ever is best: for
sith unthrifts and apostataes / that ron out of relygion and fall to flesshly
delight / be welcome to you / and good relygious folk be daily by your means
expelled out of their places / in which they were determined in chastyte /
prayer / and fasting / to bestow their lives i^ gods service: and now those
holy houses partly pulled down / partly good and virtuous virgyns put out /
left unto lechours / and polluted with apostataes / under the name of marriage
lyueng in lechery: This dealyng well declares / that ye hate no man for his
vice / but that ye rather hate the^ that be good and virtuous / because they be
contrary to your ways: and surely the great cause why ye murmr against the
church of Rome is / because ye se and were wode therewith / that it has
co^de^pned your heresies / so that it may with reason answer you with holy
scripture / which says: Non contra nos est murmur vestrum sed co^tra dominum.
your murmr is not against us but against our lord: And than shall it look
up to Christ in heuyn / whose place it represents in earth / and shall
against your heinous presumptyon graciously be herd / saye^g: Presume^tes de
se et de sua virtute gloriantes humilias.
they that presume upon them self / and glory in their own strength / thou
do abate good lord: and surely there was never man borne (I trow) that set
so much by him self / that had so little cause: but and ye were so wise i^
deed as ye stand well in your own conceyt / ye would not murmr against your
ame^dement / for as the wise man says: Uir prudens et disciplinatus non
murmurabit correptus
A discrete man and well taught will not murmr / when his fautes be showed
him. I fear ye shall find it so / that wenyng your self so wise / it will
fall by you / as saint Paul says / by the paynym philosophers Euanuerunt in
cogitationibus suis obscuratu^ est i^sipie^s cor eoru^: dice^tes se esse
sapie^tes stulti facti sunt.
/ They have done vainly in their inventions / their folysshe hertes were
blinded / calling the^ self wise men / they were made fools. So ye rise high
in your own heart / and with great bost reken yourselfe very rich of friends
/ and namely of great princes / that (as ye say) take your part in Almayn: but
I wene ye shall find to preue true upon you these words of the Apocalypse /
which says to the rich man these words: Tu dicis qia dives su^ et
locupletatus et nullius egeo et nescis quia miser es et miserabilis et pauper
et cecus et nudus.
thou affyrmest to thy self / I am rich and of great substance / and have no
need of nothing / and yet thou know not that thou art a wretch / and
miserable and poor / blind and naked: I think ere it be long / our lord
will of his high goodness provide / that with such ways as ye take / your
unwise pride will in such wise abate / that ye shall find your self as pore
and bare of all fre^des / as ye be of grace and goodness / and it begins
already / if ye have the wit to parceyue it: For where ye boost of princes
taking your part / we here of none such; but have good experience yt rude
boystous people / seduced with your sect / have common to great myschefe / by
the valiant acquitayle of good and Catholyke princes in Almayne / that
resysted your malicious faction there / to their high merit of god / honor
of this world / laud and praise of all good christen men: And where ye say /
it is no marueyle though the Emperor and some other princes pursue you / and
that it were marvel if any prince or people were on your part / rehersyng the
words of David: Gentes fremueru^t et populi meditati su^t inania astiteru^t
reges et principes conueneru^t i^ vnu^ aduersus dn^m et aduersus Christu^ eius.
the gentyls have been angry / and the people have devised i^ vain / things
have assembled / and princes have gathered togider against our lord / and
against his enoynted Christ* These words make much against you / if ye say
truth / that the princes and people of Almayne take your part / as you i^
your letter do affirm for certain is it / that your doing is in deed against
Christ / wherefore take your part against him who so will Qui habitat i^ celis
irridebit eos et dominus subsannabit eos.
/ he that dwells in the heuyns shall laugh them to scorn / and our lord
mock them / as he has all ready proved / by three or fourscore thousa^de of
your faction / which by his high punysshment / are / and has been slain.

Now where as ye so holily wysh / that god should in me so work with your
words / yt I might (as it were by miracle) be converted / and favor the
gospel: Verily / I profess my self to favor ye gospel / and that mind I
pray god / not only to continue / but also daily to encreace: but for as
much as I well know / that ye nothing else mean / by the favor of the
gospel / but the favor of your own sect / and would have your pestylent
heresies taken for Christ's gospel: And sith I well wot also / that our
lord will him self work no miracles / against the faith of his own son:
Therefore / ere the devil should work any such wondre in me / that I should
(under ye cloak of Christ's gospel) favor Luthers heresies / I would first
wysshe / that ye Luther and all yours / were there where (except ye mende) ye
and they be worthy.

Now as touching your worshipful gentle offer / that ye would / if I were so
content / make and put out another book / to my praise and honor / with
reuokynge of such words / as ye have written to the contrary / All this
labor I gladly remytte you / nor I desire none of your books / to be written
to my praise / but would yt ye should revoke your heresies / and confess your
errors / and thereby give praise and glory / to almighty god: For if ye
persevere in your heresies and leude lyueng / ye can not more highly praise me
/ tha^ in dispraising: nor more highly disprayse me / tha^ in praising / if it
be true that Seneck says: Ta^ turpe tibi sit laudari a turpibus: qua^si
lauderis ob turpia.
It is as great a shame to be praised of naughty folks / as to be praised for
naughtynesse. And therefore / where as ye in diverse parts of your letter write
your self sore ashamed of your book / that ye put out against me / layeng the
faut thereof / to the yuell instigatyon of other men / humbly besechyng me of
forgyuenesse prosterning your self to my fete / trustyng that sith I am a man
mortal / I would not bear i^mortall enemyte: Surely Luther / albeit ye have
taken your self always for so great a man / in your own conceyte / that ye
have in writynge / openly professed your self / that ye were and ever would be
/ both quycke and deed / a perpetual enemy to the Pope (to whose highness I
well know / how far the estate of a king is inferyour) yet never made I /
so great account of you / that ever I would vouchsafe / to reken my self for
your enemy: all beit I am to your heresies / as great an enemy / as any man.
Nor all that ever ye wrote against me / never moved me so sore: but that much
less / submissyon on your part / should content me / than ye now offer / if
it were offered syncerley: But sith I perceive all your humble offres proudely
poudred / with the mainteynau^ce of your former heresies: I am not Luther so
blind / but that I well parceyue / to what end entendeth your (not very well
nor wisely cloked) wiliness: by which (albeit that by the way ye sometime use
your self for lack of wit right contumelyously) yet labor ye with
blandysshyng and flatery / to get and obtain leave of us: that ye might under
the pretexte of treatyng the gospel / with our good will and favor / write
hither to us boldly / in the defense and / fortifyeng of your abhomynable
errors and heresies / at your lyberte: but if the nobles of Almayne had (as
would god they had) as well foreseen your ways in time / as I do / ye should not
there / under the name of Euangelycall lyberte / have brought in to the country
so much distructyon and myschefe / as ye have. Wherefore / as ye faynedly
beseech me / by the virtue of Christ's cross (to which cross what reverence
ye bear / your vnreuerente treatyng and vile writynge thereof / openly
declares) that I would pardone your offenses toward me / so I Luther /
unfeignedly with a very christien heart / advise and counsel you / that ye
prosterne your self / not at my fete / but at gods / and with his grace
(which is ever at hand / for them that wyllyngly will not refuse it) ye do
endeuer your self to apply the fredome of your will (which ye now synfully
deny) to the calling for enter and encreace of grace. And thereupon / that ye
so labor and enforce your self to work with all / yt ye may first puttyng
from you / and sendyng in to some Monastery / that sely wretched woman /
sometime the spouse of Christ: Whom ye to your both dampnatyon / abuse in
sinful lechery / under the pretext of laufull matrimony: than by all the days
of your life / to mourn / bewail / and lament / the manyfolde heresies that
ye have fallen in: the Innumerable heap of harms / that your yuell doctrine
has done / the piteous destruction of all those bodies / whom your yuell
incytatyon has caused to be slain. And yet above all / the most soroufull
loss and destruction / of the infynite nombre of those sely souls / which
your unhappy teaching has sent in to dampnatyon: And would our lord ye had
such grace and gostely strength / that no fear of death / could refrain you
in the reco^pe^ce of your old false errors / but that wyllyngly / ye would
prease forth / and preach now openly the truth / accusyng and co^dempnyng
all your old heresies / written in time paste / and yet remaynyng in your
heart / to the furtheraunce of your duty / and augmentatyon of Christ's very
faith. How beit / if the lack of grace / and the infyrmyte of your flesh /
can not sustain that / whereby ye dare not for dread of death / revoke your
errors presently among them / where ye have sown them: yet / disdain not to
follow saint Peter him self / though ye contempne his successors: Wherefore /
if ye dare not confess the truth but deny and fors were Christ within / get
you out at the lest ways from them / whom your self have corrupted unlike
saint Peter / in that point: and bytterly weep for your syn / with drawyng your
self somwhere far of / in to some religious place / and there take recourse
to the fountain of grace and remission / our Savior Christ: and there do
penance for your syn / where ye may revoke / and in writynge call again your
old errors and heresies / for the health and sauegarde of your soul / without
any paryll of your body: there / with reuokynge and lamenting your former
errors and yuell lyuenge / with the meke and humble hoope of gods great
mercy / with the gesture / words / and heart of ye Publycan / labor to procure
by the good contynuau^ce of fruitful penance / remissyon and forgyuenesse of
your fore passed offenses: of which your amendment and other by your means /
I would be as glad to here / as I have been sorry to se you / and by you so
many mo / pituously spylt and lost.

Finis.
