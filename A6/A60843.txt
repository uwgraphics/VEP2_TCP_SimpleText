The Light, the Way, that Children ought to be Trained up in, wherein the Holy
Men of God Walked.
If Children, and Young People ought to be Trained up in the Fear of the Lord,
and to be Sober minded; how much more then them that are Aged ought to be found
therein?

YOU that be Parents, FATHERS and MOTHERS of Children, Train up your Children
in the nurture and fear of the Lord to depart from sin, and to depart from
evil, which is the beginning of the true wisdom, to seek first the Kingdom of
Heaven and the Righteousness thereof, and then all other things shall be added;
not taken away: So that this is the first thing to be sought after, the first
thing to be minded, which the fear of the Lord is the beginning of, this
Heavenly wisdom which Children are to be Trained up in; for that is the fool
which is not rich in God; and Godliness is profitable unto all things which is
great gain, that has the promise of this life and that which is to come. So
would thou have an inheritance for them, labor to bring them unto the Light
of Christ in them, who lights every one that comes into the World, which
will bring them unto Christ, from whence the Light comes that he may bless
them, for the Light that comes from him, leads to him, that thou whether
Father or Mother, or both, may have your Children to be Gods Children, for God
is Light and dwells in the Light, and his are Children of the Light, and
walks in the Light which is the way to the Heavenly Kingdom; and this is the
way for your Children to be Trained up in, wherein the Saints walked, and had
their fellowship together, giving thanks unto the Father which had made them
meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in Light. For to be bred
up in the Stubborness, Obstinacy, Wrath, and Envy, is not the right way, such
go in the way of Cain and Corah that perished, neither are such Children of
God, who is not the Father of that Seed, his Children bear not such an Image,
but his Children are taught of Christ, learn of him who has enlightened them,
who is the Way, and none comes to the Father, but by him, who says, learn of
me, I am meek and low in heart; behold then the Way people that your Children
are to be Trained up in, Meekness and Humility of heart which Christ the Light
teaches, and all that learn of him come to be like unto him, to bear his
Image, his Likeness. Therefore you that are Parents be careful of this, that
your Children walk not in the evil Way, that the evil one leads into, which
is out of the Way of God, and the Way of the ungodly shall perish; it will not
be for the Parents joy, nor the Childrens Peace to be found in that Way; but
for Children to be found in the Truth, to do Truth, speak Truth, and walk in
the Truth, there is true cause of joy, for there they are out of the Way of the
evil one, who abode not in the Truth: And all lying is of the Devil, who are in
that, are in the evil way, which the true Light leads out of all that obey and
follow it; so to gather them into this Way that they may mind the Light, the
Way, that is your care to mind them of, and your part to perform toward them
that are Parents, that the evil one draw not out their minds, and corrupt their
minds, which you are to help them in, if they are unmindful of themselves: And
be not rash nor hasty toward them, but labor to instruct them, and with Love
and Meekness to gain them, that their minds may be turned to the Light which
turns toward God, to obey and serve him who has enlightened them, CHRIST the
LIGHT who was subject unto Joseph and Mary his Mother, and the Light leads to
follow him for an example, in whose mouth there was no guile, and then they
will be subject unto you, and obey you. For ye Children ought to obey your
Parents in all things in the Lord, and this is right, and the requirings ought
to be done in the Light of the Lord, and this is right, and what of the Lord is
required both of the one and the other.

And when your Children are come to years, provide for them such honest lawful
Callings, as the Lord inclines them to, or makes them Capable of, therein to
serve him and their Generations, and not to be exercised in things too high for
them, for if their employment be above them, it will prove burdensome unto
them, and that which they are most inclined unto, they will soonest get
Dominion over it. And that Calling is lawful or honest which is according to
the righteous Law of God written in the heart, and not contrary to it, which
law is Light. And whatsoever things are honest, just, and of good report, are
to be sought and followed after. So let your Children be employed and exercised
in the thing that is good, which is necessary, not in things unnecessary to
cumber their wits, and lade their minds with, but to come to plainness,
simplicity and Truth, that their Yea be Yea, and their Nay Nay, in all their
Communication, and let no corrupt Communication proceed out of their mouths,
neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient,
for such things corrupts them, and does them hurt, and so they loose the
simplicity, modesty, and sobriety, which things are comely and of good report.
And so let simplicity be minded, and purity, to keep out of the many mixtures,
which the high bred Scholars have brought up and invented, which the Pope has
been the Author of, the Father of, (and not Christ,) training up his Scholars
to speak Latin, Lawyers to have the Law in Latin, and Priests preaching much
in Latin, or his Churchmen (as they are called) and things concerning Physic
written in Latin, and Greek names and terms to lock up their Art, which is not
simple nor plain, brought in by the Pope, which are yet held up, which the true
Light unlocks, and makes manifest, wherewith Christ has enlightened every man
that comes into the world; his Doctrine, his Breeding, and his Manners, who
has been Gathering but the Lord will Scatter him, and has had his many
Masters out of Christ's doctrine, Masters of Art as they are called, and so
would be the Fathers and Masters unto others, when as Christ says, be not ye
called of men Master: And how can ye believe which receive honor one of
another? and says the Apostle, be not many Masters; knowing that ye shall
receive the greater condemnation; and this has Children been trained up in
many years out of Christ's doctrine, or the Apostles doctrine, out of the
Plainness and Simplicity, in the Craft and Subtilty, and so have been worse
when they came out of their Schools, then when they went in: So consider,
whether this be not an upholding Popery, to continue that which the Pope has
brought in and not Christ, for Grace and Truth comes in by JESUS CHRIST the
Light. Or did ever Christ learn his Disciples, his Scholars, diverse Tongues and
curious Arts to fit them for the Ministry? but he bid them be harmless as
Doves, and told the great Sacrificers and others that did the Sacrifices; that
he would have Mercy and not Sacrifices; go and learn what that means, and
leave off your curious Arts and Sciences, and Complements and Ceremonies, and
learn Plainness, and Simplicity, Meekness, and Lowliness in the heart, as
Christ's Disciples that learn of him. And such cannot follow Popes manners,
Popish Schools, nor be made Masters of Art, nor Innes of Court Gentlemen, to
have the changeable suites of Apparel, and their Vestments of several sorts and
fashions, nor be Masters of the Ceremonies to stand in the Court of Princes,
but learn to serve the one Master, and so through his teaching to serve one
another, that they may stand in Gods holy place, (which is better than the
Palace of Princes) with clean hands, and pure hearts, and their souls not
lifted up unto vanity; mark ye Scholars and Children, who they are that must
stand before him, who is KING of KINGS, and LORD of LORDS, and what his
teaching is, who is the KING of GLORY and LORD of the whole earth, read Psam.
24.3, 4. Now you having a Light from Christ who is the Way to the Father, and
none comes unto the Father but by him who is the Way, who Lights every man
that comes into the World, this Light will let you see your selves, and all
other ways that be contrary to it, Loving it, and obeying it, you Love Christ
from whence the Light comes; but disobeying the Light, and walking contrary
unto it, that will be your Condemnation, the Light says Christ, who is the Way
to the Father.

William Salt.
