Sir Henry Vane his Speech.
MY Lord Major, and worthy Aldermen, and the rest of the Gentlemen of the
City, In obedience to the Commands of both Houses, we that are lately come out
of Scotland, and have been eye witnesses (from the first time of our going over
thither) of the affection of that Nation to this cause and of the deep sense
they have of the present state of Affairs here in this Kingdom, are willing
at this time to make the same report, and give the same account to you of it,
as has been done to the Parliament, that you may take a right measure of the
truth of those things, and not be carried away with misapprehensions, and
misinformations from those that disaffect the cause, and would willingly abuse
your thoughts, and belief herein; and therefore as shortly as I am able, I
shall be willing to give you the account of those things which I know, and
which I have seen there, and which this other Gentleman, a rever^nd Minister,
of your own acquaintance, and of known integrity, has been privy to, that
I do not doubt, what he likewise shall deliver in this business you will very
readily give credit too, it being nothing but what will be found to be the
truth.

For the affection of that Nation, we have had many experiences of it, and of
their ready and cheerful compliance with the desires of this Kingdom, even
when they were in their greatest distresses and calamities: When we first came
over there, the affairs then of this Nation, were in a much lower condition,
then now (by the blessing of God) we find them to be; yet notwithstanding
though that Nation had many invitations from those, who as they were forward to
promise, so were they able to have bestowed great matters upon them, and though
there were many secret practices among themselves to make them set loose from
the cause of this Kingdom, yet so sensible they were, of the danger of
Religion here of the near relation that they had to their breethren of England,
and of that common calamity threatened to overrun both Kingdoms, that they
were ready to break through all difficulties, and to expose themselves to all
dangers, to take us by the hand, and to join cordially with us in the
maintaining of this cause; they did not only express this in their words, and
outward professions, but we have seen since from time to time, and by several
steps, how they have put it into Action: As soon as ever the the Covenant
which was taken here, and solemnly sworn by the Parliament, was come to their
knowledge, and sent over unto them, the Committee of Estates there, and the
Commissioners of the Genreall Assembly resolved presently for to take that
Covenant* with an unanimous and cheerful consent, as a means which under
God, they thought would unite both Nations, in this common cause, and make them
a bulwark against the Common Enemy: They did not only resolve to take it
themselves, but enjoined it throughout the whole Kinghome, and by this time we
do believe, that it has been universally taken by the whole Nation. They did
enjoyne it in such a manner, as that the greatest and powerfullest Enemies of
it amongst them durst not show their heads to oppose it, that is, they enjoined
it upon the penalties, that those that should not take it, or should defer
it, should be esteemed Enemies to Religion, to his Majesty's honor, and to the
good of the two Kingdoms, that they should have all their Rents and profits
confiscate, that they should brook, nor enjoy any Office, or benefit in that
Kingdom, that they should be cited to the next Parliament, to answer the not
taking of it, and to be proceeded with there as enemies to the Estate, and to
Relegion, and to receive such further punishment, as by the King and
Parliament ^^^uld be put upon them, by which means they have so united the
affection of that whole Kingdom* that as one man they are ready to come forth
to defend the Religion, the Liberties of both Nations, and to dye in this
Common Cause. They have not only proceeded thus far, which is a happy
Foundation to so great an enterprise as is now in hand, but they have formed
their Army, all their Officers from first to last they have settled, they have
likewise prepared their Artillery, and have it in readiness, at the
Rendevouze at Leith: They likewise have all the men that are to be of the Army
designed out throughout the whole Shires, the persons are known, and at 48.
hours, they are ready for to march, they are as sensible as your selves of the
great burdens and extremities that this Nation does at this time groan under:
They know as well too, what vast expenses you have been at to maintain your
own Armies, and yet they are not ashamed, that you should know also that their
Nation has not been without troubles, as you have been, and that they are not
yet without great wants and difficulties, for this storm did begin with them:
They have not been without great charges and burdens that has layen upon them
and particularly even for the advantage of the affairs of this Kingdom, of
late they have been at very vast expenses for the maintenance of their Scotch
Army in Ireland, which was set out by them for the service of this Kingdom at
the request and desire of the Parliament, by which means they are very much
disinabled to do that, which otherwise they would be very willing to do for
our present assistance.

They have made it apparent by several particulars, that before this Army
intended for the present service will be brought to the Rendevouze upon English
ground, one way or other, it will stand them in very near a hundred thousand
pound, which must be at their own charge and expense, over and above what they
desire from us: They likewise have let us know, that they desire not to press
us beyond our strength in matter of moneys, but only so much as may render the
service in them feasible which we expect from them: They know very well if they
have not moneys at the beginning, to encourage and strenghen the hand of the
Soldier, in the business they undertake, it will be very disadvantagious to
our affairs, therefore they expect we should send them a considerable sum of
money, to make their Army march, which they have in readiness for that
purpose, as soon as we shall send it to them, and doubt not in a very short
time to advance very far in those Northern parts even this winter, it is that
therefore which is expected from us, and that which will (through Gods mercy)
be a Foundation of releife and recoverie of this Kingdom, from the oppression
and tyranny with which it is ready to be overwhelmed, that we should apply our
selves to send them some considerable sum of money, for a speedy marching of
this Army.

Upon our coming hither, we find there has been a great deal of pains
taken in it. And we likewise discern that much is to be atributed to the
cheerful affections of this famous City, which under God has been the means
that has not only supplied our affairs at home, but has likewise contributed
to those that are abroad; not-with-standing that which has hither-to come in,
is not as yet so much as will fully do this work; if we could within some few
days be able but to Compass one twenty Thousand Pound more? we do not doubt
but we should be able (with what we have already) to put the affairs of
Scotland in such a Posture, as you shall not only quickly hear a very good
account of them, but see the fruit of them, to your great Comfort and
Encouragement.

And therefore it is that, that now is recommended to you, that you would be
pleased from the knowledge that things are in this readiness that they are,
and that Nation so willing in themselves to come to our assistance (as this I
might have added) that if any thing lay in their power, either by the morgaging
of their own private Estates, or if there were Money sufficient in Scotland
that they could render themselves Masters of, they would be willng to
contribute any thing of their own for the necessities of this Kingdom, so
much they are affected with this cause: Therefore seeing they are so sensible
themselves of our Condition, it becomes us to be so too, and to put to our
helping hand that since so small a sum as this (for the present) is that that
will be able (through Gods blessing) to carry on this work, that we may with
cheerefulnes apply our selves to the compassing of the same: Those that have
been willing hitherto, we are to acknowledge thanks to them, and the Houses
have thought of an Ordinacce that the burden shall not lie upon them, but
those that are unwilling and disaffected, are by that Ordinance compelled to
that which others out of their good affections are ready to do; so as it is
recommended to you, that since the Houses have thought fit by an Ordinance to
compel others to do it, that those that are willing would take an
encouragement from thence, and go on readily in their contributions to this
work, that if it were possible we might be masters of this sum within few
days; it is that which upon this occasion is thought fit to be offered to you:
And because there is an other Gentleman to speak, Mr. Marshall who what ever I
have omitted will be able to make up, whose words I doubt not, but will take
far deeper impression with you, and all of greater weight then any thing I
can say, and I shall give place to him to impart unto you what he shall think
fit and esteem worthy of your farther knowledge.

FINIS.
Master Marshals Speech, spoken at Guild Hall, London, on Friday October. 27.
1643.
MY Lord Major, and worthy Aldermen, and Gentlemen of this City, God has showed
me that mercy to be an eye witness, and an ear witness of all the maine
carriages of the Nation of the Scots, in relation to our afflicted condition,
since it pleased the two Houses to send me thither, to be assistant to their
Honorable Commissioners; and I am most willing (being as I am now called
thereunto) to give you an account of what I have observed.

But this Noble Gentleman has already declared it so fully, that there is not
much left for me to relate, though I were fitter to speak then I am at this
present. Only this I beseech you believe, that I am able (as in the presence
of God; to attest the truth of (I think) every particular he has delivered
to you, concerning the good affections of that Nation, their tendering our
Cause, their willingness and readiness to live and die with us in it; And
since the Lord made me able to judge of any thing; I never beheld so much
unanimity and consent in so much deep sense of the Afflictions of Brethren and
Neighbors, as I have beheld there, both in the General Assembly, and
Convention of Estates, and in Multitudes of other well-affected Persons, ^aying
our miseries to heart, I believe, as much, if not more, then we our-selves
have done.

You have heard the substance of all from Sir Henry Vane; you may please from
me to receive a few things in way of confirmation of what has been already
delivered unto you: He told you, what they have d^ne to help to sustain the
Army of Scots in Ireland, who have been employed there seventeene or eighteen
Months in our service, since they received any pay (our distresses at home,
having hindered us from doing what else we would and ought to have done) how
that they have laid out a very great sum. I add, they have made it apparent
to us, that they have expended in Meal, Clothes, and other Necessaries, no
less then four score Thousand pounds this last year, toward the subsistence
of that Army, which else had perish't before this time* Yea, that in that part
of Scotland where we were, about Lowthian* that there was scarce any on
Nobleman or Gentleman of any considerable estate, but he was this last year
out of Purse one full years Revenue, as if he were worth 100, 200, or 300.
pound, Sterling. per Annum, he has disburst so much for the Irish Army.

And as to that which Sir Henry declared as a demonstration of their
willingness to Assist us, that they have already charged themselves to the
value of 100000. pound. I add, they have been so ingenuous and clear in it,
that they have given us a particular to bring with us, which is in the hand of
this Noble Gentleman: So that any Man who desires to be satisfied* may see the
particulars of the charge which they are put to, but to bring their Army upon
English Ground; and indeed, they so clearly see the bleeding condition of
Religion and Liberty in both Kingdoms, and are so sensible of our great
exhaustions, that I have heard many of their worthy Nobles and others, whom God
has stirred up to be Active and Excellent Instruments in this time of Common
danger and Calamity, solemnly to protest; That were they able to come in, and
carry on the work without putting us to any charge at all, they would do it
most gladly; yea, I am able yet further to say, and have leave to speak it
freely, that if money can be found in Christendom, to carry on this work, they
are ready not only to engage the Public Faith of their Kingdom with ours,
(as you have already received) But that if either the Bonds or the Mortgages of
the Lands of any of the well-affected Nobility or Gentry throughout that
Kingdom, will be taken for security, they are ready to give it; yea further
yet, so deeply are they affected, that they are willing (I had almost said)
to Plunder their own Kingdom to save ours; being ready, if necessity require
it, to call throughout all the Kingdom, each Man to declare upon his Oath,
what Money, or Victual he has; that they may thereby know what proportion to
set out for the maintenance of this Cause. And lest any suspicions, or
Malignant Men should surmise, that all this forwardness is but to get
themselves into some strength in a Country, better then their own, I beseech
you know, that the Honorable Commissioners, my self, and others, who have
been attending this Service with them, have received that abundant
satisfaction of their integrity and Justice, that what Articles are, or shall
be agreed upon between them, and the two Houses of Parliament, we verily
believe they will not break one Article of the Agreement, to gain the Kingdom
of England: Their affections to this Cause are as your hearts could wish: it is
only necessity compels them to desire your assistance toward the maintenance
of their Army when they are come in; For should they come in, and Moneys fail
them, so that for want of Provision (for you will easily conceive that the
Northern Countries may be much wasted by the Enemy when they are ready to
come) they should be compelled to disband, or turn to plunder the Countries
for want of subsistence, how scandalous, yea how destructive it might prove to
both the Kingdoms you your selves are able to judge.

They are ready and prepared to come, and I hope it will not be long before
you hear that they are advanced, willing to live and dye with you in this
cause of God, and will endeavor (by Gods assistance) speedily to settle our
peace; and as willingly (according to their agreement) to return home into
their own Scotland, knowing well, that to enjoy peace with God in their own
poor country, will be better, then under color of helping us to usurp upon
ours, though far the richer.

Sir Henry Vane related further unto you, what care they have taken, and how
roundly they go to work in putting on the COVENANT, give me leave to add,
that (beside what the Commissioners of the Convention of Estates have done, in
injoyning it under pain of being esteemed and punished as enemies to Religion,
his Majesty's honor, and peace of the Kingdoms, and to have their Goods
confiscate for the use of the public, etc.) the Commissioners of the General
Assembly, according to the power given unto them by the said Assembly, have
ordained, That particular account shall be taken by the several Presbyteries,
of all who shall refuse, or shift to swear and subscribe, and that they be
proceeded against with the censures of the Church, as enemies to the
preservation and propagation of Religion.

Beside, what this noble Gentleman has further related concerning their
temptations or allurements to desist from this work, and the other
difficulties they are like to meet with in carrying it on, I have nothing to
add, unless I should tell you how deeply they are affected with the Cessation
in Ireland, and the great danger threatened to both Nations from it; and the
utter ruin of the remainder of our poor Brethren yet preserved from slaughter
in that miserable Kingdom: For by this Cessation, they, and all others see,
that these bloody Rebels, who have shed so much innocent blood, who boast that
they have slaughtered 100000 Protestants, and that they will not leave one
Protestant alive in that and this, Kingdom, and who have committed the most
out ragious and most barbarous cruelties that have ever been heard of in
Christendom, are now (notwithstanding all this) without any either repentance
or submission, acknowledged to be his Majesty's subjects, and have leave to
keep and hold what they have; to enjoy free passage, intercourse, commerce,
and traffic, with all other his Majesty's good subjects by sea and land, and
no interruption to be made to any ships which shall furnish them with Arms,
Ammunition, or any thing whatsoever; their prisoners released, and such as are
indicted for any capital offense to be set at liberty upon bail; they may
send to his Majesty such Agents as they please; yea they have authority to
prosecute all in that Kingdom who shall stand in opposition to this agreement,
and all this to last for a whole year: in which time, our Brethren in Scotland
easily discern how these inhumane and bloody wretches, may from all other
Popish Kingdoms be furnished, both to root out the remainder of our distressed
Brethren of that Nation, and enabled to come over and exercise the like
butcheries upon our selves and them. In a word, they look upon it as the most
clear stating of the Question and intention of these wars, to be betwixt
Papists and Protestants: And again, I say they apprehend extreme danger from
this cessation to both these Nations, unless some speedy supply be sent over
to enable the Scottish army there to give check to their proceedings, upon
whom they will be ready to fall as a Torrent; and when once they have devoured
them (which God forbid) we may be sure they will endeavor the like against our
selves.

In all these our troubles hitherto, our greatest supplies have been drawn, or
rather flowed willingly from this Honorable City, and it troubles me to
think that I should be force to use any Rhetoric (if I had it) to draw more
disbursements of money from you, who to the admiration of all this part of the
Christian world have (under God) upheld this great cause* and (I know) are
resolved to live and dye with it: I only beseech you to consider, that if
timely supplies may be found, this crop that has been swept off from us, will
grow again with greater abundance, and we may yet sit every one under our
own Vine, and under our own Fig Tree; and, which is much sweeter, enjoy the
fruit and benefit of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which now we contend for, and
which these wicked instruments would deprive us of. But if God for our sins
should deliver us into the hands of those that have thus desperately plotted
our ruin, I think none of you would desire to swim when this cause should
sink; or be vvilling to have either gold, silver, or plate, or any thing found
in your houses, when they should come to be possessed by these men, whose
tender mercies would be more bitter then bloody cruelties. I beseech you
therefore consider of these motions which have been made unto you, and accept
of this unfeigned Relation, which we are able to call God to witness is
nothing but the truth. And for my own part, I did see more, and do believe
more, and my heart has much more satisfaction concerning the integrity of that
Nation, their fellow-feeling of our miseries, and their willingness to help
us, then my tongue is able to utter. This is the sum of what I had to say, the
Lord direct you in what you are to do.

FINIS.
