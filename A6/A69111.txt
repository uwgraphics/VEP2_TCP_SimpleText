mY souerayn friend Attitus / how be it that I know certainly that thou art
both night and day pensif and careful / ffor the government of the common
profit of the Romans / called in latin Res publica / like as is Tytus
flaminius the noble consul of Rome Nevertheless I may purpose and speak to the
by the sentences of iij versis by the which that worshypful philosopher Enneus
the poet spoke to his friend Attitus in this manner. Certainly said Enneus I
shall deserve in this matter a good reward. great fees and wages / if I by my
wytt and resons reduce in the said versis to help the conduyt / and the
ordenaunces to supporte / and in any wise the charge and besynes that thou have
take. ffor the study of the publyk profit called the common well. to be
soueraynly and pollytikly rulid. the which brennyth and turmentith stidfastly
in thine heart. in somoche that by the same besynes exercised / thou have thy
wyttis and thyn understanding always occupied toward such wordly things to the
profitable ordenaunce. and well dysposed for the universal welfare of the cite
of Rome upon the erthely and worldly things / Thoruh which study and fervent
labor thou art greatly oppressed and reualyd in thy spyritys where thorugh thou
art much thank worthy / The said versis of the great poet Enneus be not
only of so great effect purposed so sentencyously in so few wordis full
obscure to declare. but they be of right great substance true and full of good
feith and credence /

ffor sooth^ my verry friend Attitus I know and understand the temperance and
the natural law of Justice in thy courage excercised / and also I know and
understand that by the magnifyeng of thy science and understanding I know not
one only in the scole and study of athenes of so great lawde and renomme to be
of / as that thou have of worship in that university / but many men^ know
there and understand the great benygnite the attemperaunce and also the
prudence of the in that behalf / and how be yt that thou have thyes excellent
virtues sourmountyng othyrs yet I trow and deem that thou art Sometime meuyd
and troubled in thy spiritys for the said causes ministryng / whereof I am of
the same disposicion my self / whereupon thou must nedis have gretter comfort
thanne I may give the at this time / therefore I shall abide to recomforte the
till an other time / But now me semyth it is good that I write unto the some
thing of the worship and reco^mendacion of ancient age for I will that thou
and I be recomforted / and releued of that sore burden which is common both
to the and me / that is to wite of Age which now constreyneth us and that
full certainly comyth^ and noyeth us I will by this book comfort the and me
not withstondyng that I wot certainly that now thou suffirst and endurist
attemperately and wisely all thyngys which common unto the Nevertheless when
my will was to write any thing of the age of au^cientnes I reme^brid of the as
of him which was worthy for to have this present book of which each of us
shall mow comounly use for our solace And verrily aftir that I had consyderyd
to write this book which is of moral philosophye this labor and making was
to me so joyful / that not only it took awey fro me all chargis thouhtis and
greuaunce of age but it is come toward me sost and gladsome Therefore then my
friend Attitus there is no man by whom philosophy may be praised I nowgh for /
she is such that there is no man if he obey to her in following parfytely her
commaundementys / but he may live by all the time of his age / without sorrow
and without any greuau^nce / and as to the other thyngys perteynyng to
phylosophye / we have said ynowgh^ and yet shall we sey oftyn in other books
And therefore we have sent unto the this present book in the which we speak of
age / But to thentente that our book may have grettir auctoryte / we attribue
and dyrecte all our wordys and speak to the old Caton and not as did
Aristotiles which in his book of age dyrectid his word and speech to the king
Titonus brothir of Laomedon of. which Titonus the poetys have feyned that by
the great age of him he was chau^gid in to a Crikket for our present book
should be of little auctorite if we should attribue it to a man of whom men
tellyn a fable or a feyned tale we make our book so co^pendyously that thies
two noble young men romans of noble courage Lelius and Sipion makyn emongys
them merveilyng and questionyng how that duke Caton beryth and endurith so
lightly and so easily his ancient age / And after that we make what the old
Caton ansuerith to Lelius and Scipion by reasons and by exsamplis how age must
be worshipped and reco^mended for many great and necessary causes And if it
semyth the that in this present book Caton disputih^ and spekyth more wisely
thanne he vsyd in his other bookys / hit must be attribued and remitted un to
the grekyssh^ bookis and langage in which the seid Caton studied and lernyd
plainly in the time of his old age / hit nedith^ not for to say more to the
preysyng of this book for the langage of Caton shall declare soon all our
sentence touching the honor and wisdom of old age /

Here endith the prologue of the book and begins of the dysputacion made by
Tullie beginning in the latin Sepe numero admirari soleo And first how scipion
with lelyns merueilyth and askyth of Caton /
o Noble philosopher and vaillaunt duke Caton I Sipion have oftyn times merueil
and so has this Gayus lelyus my fellow aswele for thine hygh^ wisdom and
profit in science that thou have in the as in other thingys / and also I am
wont to merueyl me that I perceyuid never that old age was to the neythir
noyous ne heavy which is so hateful to some old men that they sayen that they
beren a more grievous and more heuyer burden thanne is that mounteyn of Sicille
callid Ethna Caton a^swerith certainly good young men of noble courage hit
semith to some men that ye tweyne have merueil of a thing light and easy to
know that is to wit why age semyd me never neythyr heavy grievous ne noyous /
ffor each of thies vj ages which men name Ch^ildhode adolescence yongth
virilite manhood and old age semyn to be heavy and noyous to men the which in
them silf have nothing that may help and socoure them to live goodly and
blessidly as be tho which excercisen sciences and virtues and good werkis but
as to such men which sechyn and fyndyn in themsilf all the goods and thyngis
which belongyn well and blessidly for to live / there is nothing that comyth to
them in age by the defaute of nature that may seem unto them evil ner noyous
It is certain that old age is such that it serchith^ and fyndyth in it self
all the goodnesses whch longen to live well and blyssidly / and yet is old age
such that all men desire to come until hit / And never thelesse the
mutablenes and evil dysposicion of men hit is so great in our days that they
blamyn old age when they be come thereto by cause that then^e they may not use
delectacions

All the folis seyn that old age comyth in them son / ner then they wend /
but I demand a question of such men what manner folly constreyned them forto
trow or suppose the thing the which is false / for they can sey no reason how
old age entrith sonner in the man aftir adolescence no more than does
adolescence aftir puerice callid chidlhode which is the second age / how be
it that it is so ordained by nature that that one of the ages entrith aftir the
end of the other More ouir I demand such^ foolys how old age should be less
chargyng and less grievous to men if they might live viijC year / for how be it
that the age past had be longer yet it may neithir comfort ne allege ne
satisfye the fool old man Therefore if ye two be merueiled of my wisdom in
mine age which I would it were such^ as ye repute and understand it and would
be worthy to be knowyn and bear forth my surname Caton / I answer to you that
if I am wise my wisdom is oneli in this thing for I follow the law and
ordenau^ces of dame Nature the rygh^t good leder of kind and also I obey unto
her for all her comaundementys befulle like to the comaundementys of the dyuyne
gddys by cause that both two drawyn to the true welth^ of blyssyd disposicion
It is not like semyng sith^ Nature hath^ well disposed and ordained the other
five first ages each aftir h^is office that she had neglygently left to
ordeyne the office of old age / which is the last time and endyng of men And
as it comyth of a fool and of a neglygent clerk which can not ne may nor will
fulfill the book that he began but alwey what euir be said of old age
alleway that she has her office ordegned by nature I say that it must nedys of
necessite that it have some endyng sweet and soft for to endure to the wise man
ffor like as nature has ordained in the fruytys of trees and of erth^ which
have the fruit soft or hard that they abydyn on the tree and fallen aftyr
they ben ripe enough / so has Nature ordained of the cause of ages some as
folys will argue and rebel them against the ordenaunces of nature / but that
debate and rebellion is proprely compared and lykend to the fiction of the
poetys which by their tales feyned that in the time of Jupiter king of the
land of Crete the geauntys as folys would make werre against the goddys by the
wh^ich^ ye owe to vndirstonde that the folysshe men would rebelle against the
ordenaunces of nature chamberer and servant of god Lelyus demau^dith a question
forsooth Caton I promise the for my fellow Scipion that thou shall do unto us
right a gracious friendship if by the / we learn long time before or we become
old men / by what reasons we might suffer and endure right lightly the
chargyng and the grievous age of old men / for we hope certainly that we will
become old / Caton answerith / forsooth Lelius I shall do that thou requyrest me
so that each of you have agreeable my wordys that I sshal say to you / of tho
Lelius and Scipion demanded this question to Caton / so that it be not grievous
to the we wull desire certainly / what is the long wey by the which thou art
common in / from thy childhode until this age / for thou may teache us / as he
wh^ich had don a long viage / in the which we must enter / Caton an wered I
shall make you Lelius an answer so as ye ask aftir that I may / forsooth I have
oftymes be in the quarrel of sciuile causes disputyng / and in the parlamentis
of my felows egall to me in the disputyng and pledyng causes of their matiers
and processis ffor aftir the ancient proverb all thyngys which be like of
resemblau^te exsamples. lightly would be vndirstonde assemblyd and gaderd to
gedyr / So I shall tell you what great thyngys Salmator And Spurius Albinus
whilom consuls in Rome which were almost like to me in age / were wont to
sorrow and weep by cause that in the time of their old age they had no
flesshely delectacions / without which they seid their life was naught / And
said also that they were dyspreysed / and hold in reproof and reproach of
pain and displeasyre by whom they should be haunted magnified and worshipped
Thies men Salmator And Albinus after my demyng did not accuse and blame that
thing which they huld have accused / ffor if yt thing whereof they wept and
sorowid should come by the blame and defaute of old age by lyk reason to me and
all other ye which be gretter and older than I / should come the ij causes a
forsaid for which they sorowyn / but it is not so / ffor I know many of them
which be of such age and of gretter age than I am / which bear and enduryn
their old age without making such^ complaynte for they enduryn and suffer
gladly and be glad to be out of the prisons and bondys of flesshely
delectaco^ns and they compain not that they be dispraysed of such^ men / but
the blame and the vice of all such^ compleinyng by which old age semith
grievous and noyous is in the conditions and in the manners of the men and not in
the age / ffor certainly the old temperate men which be not dangerous ne cruel
/ enduryn and bear lightly their old age / but importunyte cruelte and
unmannerly governance is chargyng and grievous to old age / and to all other
age / Lelyus answerith and after demau^deth certainly Caton it is so as thou
say / but parauentur some might say that thou berist and endurist better thyn
old age by cause of thy richesse and for the habondaunce of the temperall
goodys that thou have by cause of thy dygnyte / and true it is that this thing
which thou have comyth but to few men / Caton answerith^ forsooth Lelyus thou
reasonest and say well that the richessis and the dignyte that I have maken me
to suffer and endure more easily mine old age / but in this thing be not all
the means patiently to suffer and endure old age The thyngys which makyn
old age sweet and pacient be as tho thingys which make a man to be noble or
to be a Chorle thereof I shall tell the by exsampl^ / There was a noble man of
athenes clepid Themystecles which pletyd with a Chorle of the Isle of seryphus
in the which were commonly froward men and evil condico^ned This scr^fios that
was a chorle said to Themystecles that he was not noble ne gentyl of him self /
but only by cause of the magnifyeng and worship of his noble contre of athenes
/ to the which Themystecles answered / By god said he and I were a man of
Seriphus as thou art / yet should I not be a Chorle / and if thou haddist be of
athenes as I am / yet sholdist thou neuir be noble in worship nor gentilnes /
In semblable wise may be said this comparison of old age / for it may not be
soft nor light to suffer and endure in great pouerte / how be it that the old
men were wise and full of letters / and also is old age grievous and danugerous
to the fool old man / how be it that he have right great habondau^ce of goodys
by his birth / Certainly my frendys scipion and lelyus the right couenable
arms of old age be the craftys and occupacio^s to use right wisely / and the
excercita^on^s of the iiij principal virtues / that is to wit / temperance /
prudence / force / and Justice if thies virtues be wel^ set to work in all
thine age / aftir that thou have lived long ynough^ / they shall bring to the
merueillous frutys of delectacion by the sweet remembrance of the good deedys
past / the frutys of thies virtues be not only merueillous by cause that they
will neuir leave their master namely in the last time of old age which is
right a great and a syngulere thing / but also the frutys of virtues be
merueillous for the conscience of the man which had well lived / and as by the
record of remembrance of many good deedys done is right a glad some thing to
the old age / wherefore it may appear unto you that old age is not without
delectacion of virtuous deedys dooyng Now come I forto show that the old men
be not dispreysed nor relinquysshed or forsakyn of other men that time when I
was as an adolescent young of age / as much louyd I that old man Quyntus
ffabius which took and recouerd the cite of tarente which is in the land of
puyle And loved him which was like me in age and in conditions / ffabyus than
an old man had in himsilf a good disposicion of a moderaunce medlyd with
curtesye and with honest and clennesse and his old age had not changed his
vsis and good custumes in any wise / But that they were as good or better as
they were in his first time / I began to haunte and love the seid ffabyus how
be it he was not meruelously of great age / but nevertheless he was than aged /
ffor the seid ffabius first was consul of Rome in the year that I was borne /
and in the year of his fourth consulat / I which was then a young adolescent
and knygh^t / went with the seid ffabius to Capne a cite in champaigne / and
the fyfth year aftir I was Questour and went to Tarent and aftir I was made
edyle of Rome and the fourth year aftir I was presture which is the sovereign
dygnyte in Rome / I had this dygnyte at that time whan^ Tudicanus and Cetegus
were consuls of rome / and ffabius which was then^e full old did so moch^ by
his amonestyng and purposyng of fair wordys that the law of Cyntius was
resceyued at Rome by the which he made ordenau^ce in yiftis of offices / that
is to wit / that tho yiftis should not be outerageous excessyfe no evil
employed and that the offices should be committed by election to sufficient men
in co^nyng and convenient personis acceptable / How be it that ffabyus was
plainly old yet made he batailles so victoriously and so egerly as he had be
in the age of adolescence in the time that hanyball a young man and duke of
cartage made werre against rome and the country a boute / ffabyus then old
suffered hanybal to sport him and take his recreacion in the champaigne of rome
and by the suffrau^ce yt ffabius had against haniball / he lessed and enfebled
him and his hooste in somoch^ yt he and his men were so sotted and delyted in
fleshely delectacions that they forgate and lost all the excercisyng of arms
and the dysciplyne of knyghthede Of this ffabyus tellith right nobly our good
and preuy ffrende the poet / Enneus ffabyus said he is a romayne which
restoryd us our country our fraunchises and our libertees by the respyte and
long suffraunce that he had against our great enemy hanyball Fabius then
old was so temperate and so prudent that of the renomme fame and worship of
all other vein gloryes he chargid not nethir set by it / but above all other
thyngys he put before the helth^ and the welfare of the comon^ profit of his
country / and for this cause the renomme glory worship and the fame of ffabyus
resplendysshed and floured aftir h^is death / more than at that time when he
lived But it should be a great thing for to tell and seye by what dylygence and
by what conseille he took and recouyrd the cite of / Tarente which then was
a castle and at that time was takyn by the affricans / It fortuned that a
consul romayne callid Salmator lost as it is said the castelle of Tarente and
fled by the withdraught in to the toure of the same castle Then aftir that
ffabyus recouird the same castle the seid Salmator me heeryng how he glorified
and magnified himself of that recoueryng by these wordys Certeynly seid
Salmator to the seid ffabius / thou have recouerd by me and by my work the
castle of / Tarente forsooth ansuerid ffabyus if thou haddyst not lost it a
fore I should never have recouird it neithirr takyn it again / This ffabyus
full old was so good in arms and in house that is to say that he was so good
in time of werr and of peace that he was not better in that one than in that
other

And eftsoon ffabyus was consul and had a fellow of office callid carinlyus
the which excercysed not his office but that notwithstondyng the seid ffabyus
then an old man resisted as moch^ as he night to the entrepryse of Gayus
fflammynyus which at that time was tribune of the poeple of Rome which against
the auctorite of the senators of Rome would deuyde by syngler partys an
heritage called the terroner Picentois and the terroner Galois And how be it
that ffabius of the connyng and office called Angure which is a dyuinore
which was a dygnyte in Rome that men yafe them to that science which
determined and knew the thyngys to come by the chirmyng and by the song and by
the countenance of the foulys and bryddys of the air / Nevertheless he had in
him the boldenes for to say that all thyngys which were made for the sauacyon
and for the welfare of the common profit callid Res publica were made by right
good dyuynyng But the thyngys made or said against the comun profit were made
or said against the sente^cys of wise men of Auspices that is to say against the
dyuynynges Iugementys and demynges the which were made by the sentences of
fowls and bryddys I have knowyn that in this man were many things of right
noble condicyo^s the which I tell not / but I know nothing more merueillous
for to say thanne is to tell how ffabyus sustained and enduryd without
mournyng and weeping the death of his sone Marius which was a noble man and
wylome consul of rome We have clearly and in a part declarid the praysyng of
the old ffabius of which when we read his praysyng we find but few
philosophers like him but me owghte to disprayse them to the regard of Fabius
and it is certain that he was not only to be recomended in great dedys of
pryse that he did outward and in the presence of the Cytezeyns of Rome But he
was better and gretter within forth / that is to wit in good conditions and
within his soul / I may not sey ynough^ what was the speech and wordys nor
what were the commandementes of the old Fabyus nor what was the knowleche that
he had of the deedys and of the sayengys of the old time I may not also say
ynowgh^ how much he knew of the art and scyences of dyuynyng and
determiinacion of fortunes to come good or ylle in time of peace and of werre by
the flygh^t or by the chirming or by the countenance of the foulys and briddis
of the year / And yet had also ffabyus science and wit enough after the manner
which the romans had and used at that time / This ffabyus conceived and
resceyued in his mind not only the romans bataylles but also remembered of
strange bataylles / I spoke as desyringly with him as I could deuyse at that
time / the same thing which fortuned of him after he died that is wit that
after his death I should have no man Romayne of whom I might learn in workis and
in techyngys such as he had be It nedith not to seye so many thyngys to the
preysyng and fame of the said ffabyus / ffor certeynly ye see well by that that
I have said that it is vntrouth^ and a vice to say that old age is wretchiyd
myschaunt or noyous so that it had be such^ as was the same of old ffabyus and
how be it that ffabyus had be such^ in all his age nevertheless it is certain
that all men may not be such^ as were the scipions and the ffabyens nethir all
men also may not be such that they might so of them self record and reherce /
the cytees the which they have fought with and werrid or conquered in the
bataylles that they have made a fore in diverse landis and reames and also by
navy of ships on the sea / nor all men also may not be such^ that they might
of them self / record nor say the victorious deedis and tryumphes which they
have had in their lives like as did the worthy Scipions and also the noble
ffabiens whilom noble romans and virtuous in them self ffor namely some old
men might in times past have be of peasible clean and fair life in governance
/ and yet is their old age plesau^t and sweet such as as we here by the
hystoryes that declaren of the old age of platon which at fourscore year and
one wrote books to teache men connyng and virtue and so dooyng he dyed Some old
age may be plesaunt and sweet hou be it that the life precedent had be still
pure and soft without war or so noyed as we hier by historyes how was the
old age of socrates the philosophre the which as men said wrote in the year
of his age fourscore and fouretene a book callid Penatheticus in which he
tawght men for to dispreyse and not to set by death Socrates lived v year after
yt he had made an end of the said book he was disciple of a philosopher
called Gorgias which was born in a castle called Leoucin This Gorgias master
to Socrates was an hundert and seven year fulfyllyd of age and he never cesid
in his study but evermore he was besyed and occupied / Then it fortuned that
men demaundid him why he would be so long alive he answerde I have not said ne
seen in me any cause why I should accuse nor blame mine old age / Certainly
this answer was right nobly spoken and was worshipfully said and appertynent
to a wise man / The foolis would sey in contrary of thanswere of that
philosopher Gorgias ffor the foolys puttyn upon the old age their own vices
and blame which come of them silf / that is to wit / the foolys accusyn their
old age and puttyn upon it the vices and defautys which come of their evil
conditions in yongth and not of the age which thing did not the poet Enneus
of whom we have now late made mencyon / for in showing what he was in old age
he made thereof a comparison^ / I am seyde Enneus as the strong horse which many
atyme hath^ discomfited / the other horsys in rennyng lightly / and is come
first to the prycke / And by cause that now this horse is old he restyd him
and labourith no more / This Enneus comparith and resemblyth^ his old age to
the old age of a strong and a victorious horse / Of this Enneus may we well
have in mind for the xix year after the death of him Titus fflamminius and
Marcus Attilius were made Consuls of Rome and Ennius dyed at that time whan^e
Sipion and Philip was made the second time Consuls And I which than was sixti
and five year of age purposyd and pletyd with a great and high voice a fore the
senators of rome for the law which made bocone one of the wise men of Rome /
and that law I preuyd and sustained by suasyons and good reasons vayllable
when ennyus was sixty and ten year of age / for he lived so long by age /

The said poet Enneus being old as I have said suffered and endured so
pacyently and so well two great burdons / which men reputen and accept right
great / that is to wit pouerte and old Age / that it semyth that Enneus had
therein great delectacyon /

Here endith the first part of this book / which is the disputacyon of duke
Caton And begynnyth the nombryng of the causes. why old Age semyth to be
wretchid and myschaunt. And in this same distincyon Caton confoundith repreuyth
and abasshith Scipion and Lelius of the first defaulte which they opposyn Caton
against old Age / And begynnyth in the latin Etenim cum complector animo.
quatuor causas reperio etc. Scipion spekyth for him and for lelyus.
When I Scipion considre certainly in my courage. for how many and what
causes the old age semyth to be wretchid myschamit and noyous. I find of them
only four causes. The first cause and reason is. by cause that men taken away
from old men thadmynystracions and governance of things. which requyren
work and labor of bodyly strength^ or aduys and lack of wit and of
understanding. The second is by cause that old Age makyth men feeble. seekly
and foryetefulle. The third cause is for as much that old age takyth away
fro men all delectacyons and pleasurs naturelle as sensualitees in getyng of
chyldern. The iiij reason is by cause that the old man aftir course of nature
is not ferr from death

Caton answerith now see we if it please you how great and how Just / and of
what value ben each of thies four causes which men opposyn against old age /
and first tell me how ye vndirstonde that old age withdrawith and takith away
fro men the governance and the admynistracion of thyngys concerning bodily
occupaco^ns of strength and besynes / and if it be so / tell me of what
thyngys / and ye parauenture shull answer me that men take away and withdrawn
fro men by cause of old age the admynistracion and governance of the things
that men takyn in yongth by bodily strength / And that time wha^ne the body is
in strength and wertu / but thenk ye not Scipion and Lelyus that old men have
not some thyngys and workys which they may and can admynystre and do in
their age / And also thynk ye not but some thing ben which men may make and
admynistre by the Counseil of old men how be it that namely they have their
bodies seek and maladif Say thou then Scipion that this old man ffabyus
did nothing profitable to the government and to the admynistracyon of the
common profit of Rome / Say thou also that nothing did thy ffader Lucyus
Paulus for the welfare of Rome of whom my sone young Caton had weddid the
daughter

Say thou also that thies other old men callid ffabrycius and the curious
and the Cornycanoys did nothing whenne they defendid and sauid with their
counseile and by their auctorite the common profit of our cite of Rome / There
was at Rome one Appius an old agid priest which seruid in the temple of
Minerua other wise callid Pallas which priest was fulle old and with that he
was blind / And it fortuned that at that time Pirrus the king of Epirites made
werre against Rome / and insomoche that the senators were inclined and
concordid for to make peace and aliance with the seid king Pirrus and
notwithstondyng that Appius was an old man and blind / yet he doubtid not for
to say the senators the wordys which the seid Enneus had set in versys /
whereof of the sentence is thus / why seid Appius have ye inclyned and reualed
your courageous hertys / which til now were accustumyd to be ferme and
stidfast / be ye madd or for lak of discressyon agree ye for to condescend and
desire ye to make alliance and peace with king Pirrus by cause that he puttth in
strength for to putt you down and in subjection and would destroy you / and
other thyngys he seid right felly and right grievously he rebukid them / and the
seid Appius fulle old said yet to the senators / and yet ye know said he
that Enneus made the versys that I have here allegid and seid by the which he
repreuith you / and also ye Scipion and Lelyus mow have seen the reason by the
which Appius old and blind purposid this matier before the senators /
seuentene year aftir that he had be the second time consul / and yet there was
x year betwix her first and second consulat / wherefore men may vndirstonde that
in the time of bataile of king Pirrus the seid Appius was of a great age / that
is to wit seventy and vij yeris / The old Appius did / by his resonyng and
talkyng that the Romans vndirtoke then their entrepryse and ordained a great
host against king pirrus which by them was discomfited / which was thing full
merueilous / And algatis we have herd it said by our ancient ffaders They
then preue not ne afferme any thing against the counseil of old age / that
say that they may nor can entirmete and meddle of nothing And tho that so say
/ ben like to them which supposyn and wene that in a ship saylyng by the sea /
the lodesman / which is callid the patron or master of the ship / which
kepyth the rothir or stern of the ship to guide yt well does nothing but
attendith only to that / by cause that some young men clymmyn upon the mastis
and some men drawn up the ankyrs and some young men trussyn up the sails / and
someothir young poompyn and drawn water out of the harmeron of the ship /
and also as ye may see the patron master or lodesman which that holdith and
kepith the rothir of the ship which restyth and sittith in the end of the ship
and takith keep to the nedyl and compass to know the direct course of the ship
saylyng does not that besynes of bodily strength which be longs to young men
to do / but all the charge and welfare of of the ship merchandise and mennys
lives lieth^ in the wit and discrecion of the old man which is patron master
or lodesman of the ship / and for thies seid causes I answer you / that he
does gretter and bettir thing then young men / for he counseylith ordeyneth
and auyseth of the most chargeable things which ben to be done / for the
great things of charge be not made by strengthis of body nor by delyuernes
and plyantnesse neithir by lyghtnesse of body / but they ben made by counseill
by auctorite experience and by ordenauncys of great wit and high discression /
of which thyngys / old age is bettir provided and stuffed by experience /
then any other age / and by old age they lose not her time / But parauenture
ye shall replye to me / by cause that it semith you that now I do nothing and
that I was wont to employe and occupye me in werre and in deedys of armies in
diverse batailles for the defense to be made against the adversaries of Rome /
And now I may werre no more / I which was wont to be one time excercysed in
the office of a knight occupied in bataille and arms / anothir time vsyng the
office of tribun / anothir time the office of an ambassiatour or a begat / and
anothir time sittyng as consul / I answer you that euir I do somewhat for the
profit of rome / for before the time I ordeyne and devise to the senators the
things which be most expedient to be done for the honor of ye romans / and
I denounce and make to be remembrid long before the time of necessitee to the
senators and to the romans / by what manner men may resist against the land
of cartage our great enemies which now by long time have be full evil and
maliciously disposed for to make battle and mortel werre against our cytee /
Wherefore know ye verryly Scipion / that I shall not sece to make ordenaunce and
provisions which be long to defend us from our enemies yt we romans shall
not dread ne doubt the power of the cite of Cartage / unto the time that I
know that it be alto gedyr destroyed by victory of battle / which bataylle I
desire that the Inmortell godys give to the in such^ manner that thou poursiewe
the destruction of the remenaunt that be left living of our Ancient Enemies /
which thy grauntsyre Quintus ffabyus left in the cite of Cartage / which
decessid now xxxiij year past But he was such that in all the yeris following
/ there shall be mind of his tryumphe and worship And know Scipion that thy
Grauntsyre Quintus dyed the same year whan^e I was made Judge at rome / And ix
year aftir when I was made consul thy seid Grauntsire Quintus was made consul
aftir the end of my consulat / And if then thy Grauntsire Quintus had lyuyd
/ unto an.C. year. he should neuir had be aunoied discoragid nor weery of his
old age / for it was so profitable and so honest to him / how be it that he
had left the use and the manner of deedys of arms / in which young knyghtys /
preuen and assaye themsilf / that is to wit / lightly for to run / ferr for
to lepe / and to Just with speris and to fight mygh^tly with axes and with
nakyd swerdys Nevertheless and he had lived unto an C year he would have
ordained thies seid occupaco^ns to be excercised and the study of the common
profit by counceill by reason and by moderat attemperau^ce and sad
deliberaco^n which thingys but if they were in old men roted by experience^
our ancient ffadirs had neuir said yt the souerayn cou^seill of the cite well
governed should be callid a wise senate which signifies a wise feliship of
old men / the romans lacedomonois and ben right noble and of Ancient fol^kys
of Greece. which whilom had great people in their domynacion / they called old
men to them / which had emongis them the souerayn dignyte and the grettist
office / also in such dignyte or office men deputed not but old men of
connyng / science / and of craftis / And ye will read or here the old
hystoryes of philosophres / ye shall find that the common profytes of other
contrees as weel as of ours wh^iche were right great in dignyte and worship
have been lessid and destroyed by the governance of young men of adolescence and
young Age But after that they have be sustained and reformed in their first
astate by the advise and governance of old men / they have prosperid in great
worship and felicitee / as they did by fore time / Now tell me Scipion and
Lelyus how ye have lost your common profit that was right great and full rich
/ I make you this demand for they that pleyen the pagentys in the comodyes of
pleyes of solas and disportys / which Nenius the poet made a dyaloghe of two
personys which had lost a right great and a rich patrimonye of their
enherytaunce / It was in semblable wise so questyoned as I do / And to this
other demaundys men answeryn otherwise to matters which ben not specyfied here
/ But the pryncipall answer of the poet Nenyus was this / To this governance
of your common profit / reualyd and brought to naught / came many new young
masters ygnorant and vnkonnyng of the lawys / both aduocatis young apprentises
that presume them connynger in the laws than they be / and foolys of young Age
/ And therefore ye lost that rich patrymonye and enherytaunce by outragyous
governance and fool hardynes / and for lack of discrecion by the properte of
nature and kind of young Age / ffor prudence and good auyse of great
discression ben the propertees and nature of old Age / Scipion opposith and
seyth to Caton but for all that / in old age is another lack or a defaulte
ffor in old Age is lessid the mind and remembrance of the things that men
knew in their young age / Caton answerith I believe Scipion that the mind of an
Agid man is less / but if he exercise and occupye it in remembryng the things
chargeable that he knew before And also it lessith more his good remembrance
if he be borne a fool / or else naturelly so evil of complexion or ellis be
hurted in that part of the head wherein lieth^ the virtue memoratyf called
remembrance / A noble man of Athenes called Themystocles had in his mind all
the names of the cytezeyns of Athenes / Deem ye the^n that when Themystocles
became old that he would salewe the great and worshipful Lysimacus an old
cytezeyn of Athenes instead of Aristidees another old citezein of Athenes /
for soth nay for Themystocles excercised his mind in recordyng and remembryng
the things that he knew in h^is young Age / I my self have known not only
Lysimacus and Aristides / but I have known their fadirs and their grauntsirs /
and in the mean time that I read the Epitaphies of scriptures wretyn upon
their toumbes / I doubt it not as some men seyne that I do not forgete the
remembrance of their names for by cause that I exercise my mind in redyng
their Epytaphyes it come again to mind of the men decessid for whom tho
Epytaphies were made / More ouir I show you by experience that if the mind of
man be excercised in old age / it lesith not / for I herd never say that any
old man who so ever he be would forgete in what place where he had hid and
leyd his tresour / Also old men have mind of the wages fees and pensyons that
they ben assigned unto / And also of fees and wages that they have assygned to
other of their counseyl and seruantys / Also they have mind of the names of
their Creancers to whom they owe / and also of the dutees and goods which is
owyng unto them / Old men remember them of many and diverse things of great
weight and charge / ffor they remember of the laws that wise men have made
upon the caases pleted that been comenyd and ordained emonge them / Old men
remember of the right and of the constytucions and ordenaunces / which by the
bysshoppes have be made for the service of the goddys / They also remember full
well how the angurys that be dyuinatours done and should determyne and
pronostike upon the dyuinacions and things that be for to come / And also they
bring to mind what opynyons had the philosophers in determynyng the causes of
the naturelle things and moralle things / ffor if it be any doubt or debate
of any thing belongyng to the governance of the world / men goon only to the
mind of experience and remembrance of old men / in the wittys of whom is
most naturelle virtue of gostely force and strength of the soul which abides
stylle with old men / so that the study and industry abides hoolly with them
/ that is to wytt / that men / notwythstondyng their old age / yet they abyden
witty and subtyl in their ymaginacions and good conceytes / so that they apply
their couragys to tho things specially / and they have wisdom and
perseueraunce in the same / And know ye Scipion anth Lelyus that the wits
and good remembrauncys abyden not only in old men of noble degree and of hygh^
astate which have honorable and worshipful offices / but also the wits and
good remembraunces abyden in other old men / also which have never
admynystracion ne governance of the common profit but only of their own
propre goods and preuy things belongyng to themself / as of their household
keeping and of their marchandysing or other honest occupaco^ns vsyng

And the poet Sophocles unto his great old age made in versys diverse and many
tragedies / in which he wrote the evil and abhomynable deedys of the kings
and princes of the world / Al be it seemed to his children by cause that he was
intendant to his books to study / that he was necligent to govern his own
propre goods and things / And therefore they made him to be called in judgment
before the iuges / by cause that as it is of custom after the law of Rome for
to interdire and take away the admynystracion of good fro them that do not
approwe it profytably ne does not well their occupacion and works / Also that
the iuges of greece would have taken away from Sophocles as a fool and
neglygent of the governance of his own propre goodys and cataillys / Then
the old man Sophocles began to reherce and seye by heart before the Iuges
afable of a tragedy callid Edipus collonnoys that is to wit of a sad Cronycle
and of an hystory lamentable which he had all ready in his handys and had
writyn it not long before / And aftir that he had purposyd and declarid his
Tragedy he questyoned to the Iuges why it semyd them that he was a fool
which made such versys and such a ditte of a substancialle process / then
he by the sentence of the Iuges was absolved and dischargid of the accusacion
of his childeren / Tell me then Scipion and Lelyus if the old age
constrayne a man for to be changed or for to be depryued for to seace from his
studyes / thise four noble poetys Sophocles Esyodus Simonides and Tersytorus /
he answered nay / Tell me also if the old age constrained them to be changed
or for to seace in their studyes thies two philosophers Socrates and Gorgias of
whom we have spoken here a / fore and Omer the poet Pytagoras and demacritus
Platon and Exenocrates / And aftir this zenon Celantes and that worthy Dyogines
the which namely ye have seen at rome which vij have be and ben princes of
philosophers callid Sovereign wise men / forsooth old age made them neuir to be
changed nor to sece in their study of bookys redyng / see ye not / that in
all thies poetys and philosophers lives the frequentacion and exercise of
their studyes has be like to the time of all their lyfdayes / ffor they have
studied by as long time as they have lived / sithen that they had be of reason
/ But leave we to speak of thies studyes of philosophers and of poetrye which
ben dyuyne sciences / and come we to speak of the artys of the vij sciences and
of the Craftys that men made by labor of body I may name you some old men
laboers Romans my neyghbores and my famyliar frendys which ben of the ground
of ffabyens / that workyn so fast and so well that their workys ben neuir
gretter ne better as then when they be present there at / be it in sowyng
corn and greffyng trees or in gaderyng the fruytes and puttyng them in the
garners / that is a thing more marvelous that thies old men which have hope
to live but a while labouryn so greatly in sowyng corns of diverse greynes in
plantyng and in setting trees and in greffyng trees to bring forth diverse
kyndys of frutys / and also in gaderyng of them again / And in leying up such
prouysions / and tho thyngys necessaryes to live with all. how be it that in
other men which hopyn and trust long to live by them / hit is a less
merueile so greatly for to labor in such besynes But ye may seye that thies
old men labouren so fast for they thenkyn the use of their labors ioyeth
them greatly / ffor that say ye / there is no man so old / but he weenyth that
he may live a year longer / forsooth Scipion and Lelyus / that that ye say is
somewhat true / But old Caton answerith / men labouryn in thyngys which they
know that to them it apperteyneth not / nor shall not apperteyne in any wise /
fforthies old men set plants and greffyn trees to bear frutys of diverse
kinds / by cause that they do profit and being forth fruit to men that
aftir them shall come and not to them silf only that settyn thise trees / As
says stacy an auctor of our cite in a book of his which men namyn
Sinophedys in which he spekith of the age of men or they have berdys / fosoth
said stacy / the labourer how be it that he thenkyth he is old he dare well
answer to him that demaundith and askith him for whom and to whom he settith
and greffith the trees / I set them seid he to the goddys Inmortall and not to
me ne to them that by mine elders in age which anon shall dye That is for to
vndirstond I plant trees to the men and bylde castles townys and housses for
to dwell upon for cratures which shall be borne aftir my decees / And also I
set and graff thies trees to the service and profit of the goddys / which
only would not that I should resceyue of my predecessors thies trees / but the
goddys would that I should gyfe them to such^ that aftir me shall come as is
before declarid and said / Scipion and Lelyus apposyn / forsooth Caton better
spekyth the philosopher Cecylius / then did the labourer of whom thou spekyst
of for Cecylius said / of an old man which thought yet to live by a great age
/ By god said he / dame old age / if thou shuldist not bring with the any
other vice or any other defaute of felicite and blessidnesse when thou comyst
then is age / yet thou bryngyst a vice and a defaute / which suffisith to
the disconfortyng of myserye and unhappiness / that is to wit / that in
living long time the man sees many thingys which he would not see / and also
he seeith many thingys which he desyrith greatly for to see for his syngler
joy and pleasire And also it is true that a man being in adolescence of young
grene age fallith oftymes in things of displeasyng / and such / that he would
that he had not seen them / Scipion and Lelyus opposyn / forsooth Caton the
philosopher Cecilyus said of old age a thing is no more vituperable and
lothyng / then is the same that he seeith here before I hold said he a thing
that is most wretched of all thyngys that men may feel and perceive that in
old age / how an old man is hateful and lothfull to any man / be it also of
an old man or of any other age Caton I answer you that the old man is not
hateful to anothir / but is glad and amyable / for as the old wise man has
delectacyon with the adolescence / and in young men / which have in them some
tokyns of resemblaunce and showing to be good and worthy of noble courage in
time / to come to great worship / and that old age is softir and more joyous
when old men ben hawntid and loved of young men / Also young men and adolescent
have joy to resceyue the comaundementys and techyngys of old men by the which
young men ben introducid and enfourmyd to the study of virtues and of good
workys which makyn their old age ioyfulle and amyable toward the world / Ye
two young men Scipion and Lelyus I vndirstonde that ye be glad and loving
toward me / therefore I seace here after for to say any more of this matter /
ffor ye see and vndirstonde well how old age no more then other age is not
languysshyng nor seek nor slothful nor ydyll / But namely old age euir
workith and labourith and does and makith ready euir somewhat / that is to wit
such as he did and excercised in the aages precedent if ye ask me what old
age labourith / I answer you that old men learn somthyng ouir that / they
know / as we hier by the hystoryes that Solon oon of the Chief vij wise men of
Athenes that aftir their decesse were callid philosophers / glorified him to
have learned in his old age the science for to make versys in metyr aftir the
mesure of time and nombre of sillables and Solon said that he became old every
day in lernyng somewhat as I have do that have learned as I said the letters and
the langage of greece as willyngly and as desiryngly as he that drynketh
couetously and largely of the cup that would slake his thurst that he bare
long And know ye that I have learned the letters and the grekishe langage by
cause that I might know by the grekisshe historyes the exsamples / whereof ye
see me to use in this book / And as I have herd say that Socrates a grekisshe
philosopher had in his old age learned for to pley with musical Instrumentys
with strengys as is of harpyng and lutyng and such other manner Instrumentys of
musyque I was moved to that / that I should also learn the play of Instrumentys
of musyk as I learned the letters and the grekysshe langage / for the ancient
noble men philosophers for the comfort and solace of old age lernyd to play
in instrumentys of musyk with strengys / and therefore I did putt my study and my
labor for to learn and know the letters and the langage of greece in my great
age /

Here endith the second part and the first destynctyon of the book of old age
/ And aftir begins the third part and second distinction which Caton
answerith confoundith and repreuith them of the second defaulte of
uituperacyon opposed against old age
N the nombre of the ffoure causes here above rehearsed / where by how / and in
what wise old age semith to be noyous and lothely / the second distinctyon
contained the cause why old age semith to be myschaunt noyous and wretchid /
that is to wite by cause that it makith the body seek and fell / wherefore I
answer you Scipion and Lelius that forsooth I desire not for to have the
stre^gthis now of an adolesce^t young man aftir that I am become an old man
no more then I desired when I was an adolescent young man to have the
strengthys of a bulle or of an Olyphant / A man ought / well for to use in
every age of that thing that nature yeueth him / and also it apperteyneth that
thou do all thyngys aftir the mesure and aftir the quantyte of thine own
propre strength and not to usurp and take the unto gretter thyngys than thou
may not nor have no power to execute / ffor it may not be said more
abhomynable nor more spiteful word than was that which was said of a champyon
callid Milo which was of crotoine a cite of greece which Milo than being old
as he saw the mighty champyons and wrestelers which preued and assayde their
strenghtys by diverse manners in the common place that was ordained for to do
such maystryes / This Milo as men seyen / lokid upon his arms and said with
weeping terys / forsooth thies arms and and thies sides arne deed / But I tell
the Milo that thine arms and thy sides for whom thou wepist fore / ben not so
deed as thou art thiself / which is but as a Iaper both feynt and feeble / and
forsooth thou were neuir reputid noble for no wisdom / nor for no virtue of
thine own might and courage / but thou have ben worshyppid and set much by
for thy strong arms and for thy strong sides when thou didist wrastill against
other men / this Milo a man unworthy and unnoble of little reputacyon for any
wisdom that he had / but for his strong sides and the brawnys of his bonys and
synewys / which from his adolescent young age accustumyd and vsid to bear upon
his shulders a young and a litl^e calff / which aftir grew and became a great
and an huge ox / and by thaccustumyng and use that Milo had to bear it from
yongth / and when he was light it was nothing grievous to him for to bear it /
aftir that he was grown and become an ox / heavy great and huge / The old
Emilius which by syx times was consul at rome / wepyd neuir in desiryng again
the strength of his yongth / as did Milo the Crothoniois / also no more did
Titus Cornutatus / which by many yeris was borne before the seid Emilius /
No More did also that old man Publius Crassus / which all three as consuls
ordained to the cyteseins of rome the rightfulle law civil for to observe and
govern the cytees and the people / of thies three old men that their wisdom
ascendid in encreacyng and continued unto the last spirit of their lives /
Scipion demaundid a question and askith / if any old agid man being an
orator or a pletar that is to wit an aduocat lernyng the law for
admynystracion of Justice if it be to doubt that he may err or fail in
damau^dyng or askyng his reasons by the defaulte of voice and of matiers
couenable and necessaryes in purposyng and vtteryng before a Judge / fforsoth
the office of an aduocat is not only in clernesse and subtilte of wit / but
he must have in purposing his matters and in declaring both in good reasons of
eloquence and wit a demure countenance and bodily strength for to speak
couragyously well and wisely and also attemperately / aftir as the causes of the
matiers shull require / As if the matter be comfortable / the^n to purpose it
with a ioyouse spirit / and if the matter be dolorouse / lamentable and piteous
/ than he must purpose and declare it with lamentable spech and soft
cou^tenau^ce

Caton answerith and seith that voice which is temperat soft and demure of
sweet eloquent speech purposid / which has be excercised in the orator / that
is lernid in his yongth / It shyneth and flourisshith parfyteli in the man
whenne he is come in old age which is so syngulere a thing that I know not
the cause of it / but as a virtue given to him / and as ye know I have not
lost the voice of sweet eloquence both acceptable and favorable / and yet ye
see that I am / lxx / yeris of age / But nevertheless if ye will know why the
voice that is soft and demure shewith acceptably in the mouth of old men / I
answer you that the spech of the old man fair of good eloquence if it be
curtoysly peasybly and temperatly vttred / the wit and the sweet langage of
the wise old man makes him fulle often to have great audyence and favor of
the herers / And if thou which art old have parauenture some reason so long or
so hard for to pronounce or plede which thou may not acco^plisshe and
fulfill in spedy time / neuirtheles thou may honestly comau^de to such young
men as ben Scipion and Lelius / that they vttir and speak for the / and the
aged man's office is to mynistre his sage counseill by his instruction to the
young orators studyeng the laws / whereby he may the more sadlyer ground his
matters to a good conclusion by his great wisdom / for there is nothing more
joyful to studie^tys lerners than is old aged men approved / in connyng which
be acco^panyed / and felisshippid as among young men which have appetite and
courage to study and lernyng / for to obey to the comaundementys of old men
/ And we old men leave some things which we might well do aftir the stre^ght
of our yeris to thentente by cause that young men ben by us taught and enfourmed
/ for to exercise and for to do all honorable office by / There is no work
nor occupacion more noble and more comendable than that by the which old men
teache young men to exercise and to do all honorable office / And certainly me
thought whilom that thies vnoble old men of worship / Gilyus Publius and the
two Scipions thy grauntfirs and Lucius Emilyus and Publius Affricanus were full
blessid / fortunat and happy / whe^they were in the feliship of the noble young
men romans which of the seid old men took thexsamples of virtues / ffor me
ought to thenk that all old men ben full blessid and fortunat which ben
masters and techers of good condico^ns great wisdoms and profitable sciences
/ And how be it that the naturell strengthis lacken and faillen in old men
nevertheless that lackyng comith more ofter by the vices and outragyousnes of
young age than it comith by the vices of old age / ffor the age of adolescencye
outragyous and evil disposid / and intemperat / yeldith and causith the bodi
to be feeble and unwieldy in old age / ffor where as Cirus king of perse was
full old / he co^fessid by his word that he hadd / at the time of his death /
that he felt not / nor neuir perceyuid / that he was in any wise become old by
cause of old age / no more than he was in adolescence as tellith an
historyographe a cronicler callid Exenophon / I remember me that when I was a
child I saw an old man consul romayn callid Lucius metellus / sithen that he
had be iiij year the chief of the bisshoppis of rome aftir that he had betwies
consul / he was hool^ and vygorus in vndirstondyng and he duellid in that
dignyte of souerayn bishop by xxij year and in so good strengthis he lived /
to the last end of his age / that he ne required nor desired neuir te
return ageine to the state and age of adolesce^cye / It nedith not to me for
to say any thing of my silf how be it that this book that we make is the work
and process of recomendyng of old age and which apperteyneth to our age that
be old men as be they of whom we have spokyn / Ye also may see how Nestor one
of the kyngys of greece techid and enfourmed / and set before the exsamples of
his wisdoms and virtues in a book that Omer the poet made of ye battle of
troy / Nestor at that time when he prechid and taught his virtues was then
in the third age of man for he was upon an hundird yeris and yet he made no
doubt but in recome^dyg him silf / he semid to be full arogau^t and auau^tyng
and nevertheless he recomendith not only him self / but the poet Omer him
preyseth also of his great virtues / ffor certeynly seid Omer of the tongue of
old king Nestor stilled and droppid a langage swetter than honey / and for to
speak that of his swetnesse of langage the seid king nedid not of strength of
body / and neuirthelesse the king Agamenon duke and leder of the battle of
greece against the troyens askid / neuir ne required / to the goddys immortell /
that he might have x such knyghtys as was the young / Ayax by cause that
Agamenon might the rathir discomfite the troyens / But the duke Agamenon askith
and requires to the goddys that he might have vj such old men as was that
king Nestor and Agamenon said / that if he might have vj / such old men / he
doubtyd not but within short time troy should be takyn and destroyed / But in
leuyng to speak of myself that am of thage of ffourscore and iiij yeris / and
forsooth I would that I might magnifye and auaunt my self of that same thing /
whereof Cirus king of perse glorifieth and vauntyth him / saying of him self /
that he felt neuir nor parceyued that he was in any wise become feeble by cause
of old age / no more tha^ne he was in his adolescencye / But algatys I say this
of myself / that now I am not of such strength as that I was at that time
whe^ne I was knight in the battle punike in aufrik / or at that time when I
was consul in spain or four year aftir that I was tribun of the romans
knyghtys and fought nych to the mountains callid thermophiles that departen
the perces from the grekys / and at that time when marcus attilius regulus was
consul / But as ye see Scipion and Lelius / old age has not enfeblid me of
all and wastid my body / and also ye see that the court and the parliament of
the senators askith not nor desiren my bodily strengthis / that is for to
vndirsto^de but for to cou^seill the thyngys and the causes publikes / for ye
common profit which concernyth the common welfare of the cite to be well guyded
/ hit nedith not to the expedicyon of the thyngys that I be strong of body /
but only it suffiseth that I be prudent and temperate / Just and strong in
courage / also the seeges of the auditoryes of the Iuges which I occupye and
exercise requyren / and dema^de not that I be strong of body / nor my frendys
nor my seruau^tys / ne tho that occupye and hau^ten mine house / asken not that
I be strong of body / for without any great strength I may do my deuoire to
speed them / And know ye Scipion that I neuir conscented to an old proverb /
that many men approuen and commend / which amonyssheth and signifies that
thou be comyst old hastli if thou will long be old but I had / lyner that I
were not old than I were old / or I should be / by naturell age And forsooth
there is no man that might yet / take or say against me how I have been occupied
and as said to be old / or I should have it aftir course of nature / and true
it is that I have less strength of body / then any of you tweyne / And also
non of you two have the strength of this captain romayne callid Titus poncyus
/ and how be it that the seide Titus have gretter strength than any of you two
/ yet he is not therefore stronger in virtue by cause that any man ougth to be
reputed and accomptyd / for strong / It suffisith only that in him be
temperaunce of strength / That is to wit that he vndirtake not the thing which
he may not perform / And also it must nedys be that every man enforce him and
putt him in deuoire to begin that thing which he may perform / and if
every man will tempre and modre his strength so as I have said / he shall have
great desire and plesire in his strength as I shall show you by thexsample
following / The worthy knight Hercules and also the men of greece ordained / from
iiij / to iiij yeris in the montayne of Olymphus the highest of the world
Iustyngys turnementys and wrestlynges in the worship of their god Iubiter /
Then it fortuned / yt a champyon callid Milo of crotoyne came in to the place
and in the cyrcuyte whereupon men made thies plays / he bare as men said a
beef callid an ox upon his shulders by the space of an hundird paces / So I
question the Scipion which strength haddist thou lever to have either the
strength or the wit of the philosopher Pytagoras / or the strength of the seid
Milo / ffinally I tell the thou owhtist use of the bodily strengthis which is
oon of the goodys of nature in the mean time when thou haste them / But when
the goodys of bodily strength ben no more in the / then thou shuldist not
require it nor ask it save that thou may say parauenture that the
adolescentys which ben in the third age owghten to desire and ask aftir the
age of pueryce which is second age / and by that he is the ferthir from death /
Therefore I tell the Scipion / that when men ben somewhat entrid and come within
adolescence / which is an age fructuouse and profitable / they to require it
and to ask it / And not puerice callid Childhode which is without avail and
profit The course and the weye of age is certain and determined by nature /
which has only awey which is simple and is nothing different more in the
one than in the other / But ech^ goo by that simple and determined / wey aftir
the degrees in their course from the one age in to that other / And yet nature
had yeuen to every part of age his own propre season and time / and her
partynent course of usage in kind / That is to wit / that sickness and
maladye is propryd to the age of puerice in childhode / and cruelte is
approprid to the age of yongth / worshipfulnesse and sadness of manners be
appropryd to the age of virilite which is is the fyfthe age / Moderaunce and
temperaunce be propred to old age / Eueriche owith to have sumwhat naturelly
and appropred unto that / which may be gadird in his time I would Scipion that
thou woldist give me audience / and I shall tell the what thing did old
Masimissa one of the kyngys of auffryk / which was our enemy and also he
which was Lelyus fellow / whenne thou foughtist and discomfitist in bataile
Siphar / the king of Munyde / This Masimissa which was of age xxiiij yeris
whe^ne he began to walk on foot / he would not skipp on horsbak / and when^e
he rode an horse bak / he would not light down during all that voyage / he was
neuir constrained for to keuir his head / for any rain nor for any wind or
wedyr were it never so cold / This old Masimissa had in him a sovereign
dryenesse and leenesse / and also he fulfillid and mayteyned all sovereign
officis and all nobleness parteyning unto a noble court and to ryall
puissau^ce / that is to wit to be a tresorer a countroller and a steward orels
a Grant maystir in a kyngys or in a pryncys court / By this then apperith
that the excercitacion / the frequentacion and the attemperaunce that a man
kepith in his young age / may keep in old age / sumparte of the ancient
strength which was before in the body Some may oppose me / that in old age
there be no strengthis / and I answer to that / there is noon old man that
askith to old any strength or any work that be done by strength / By this
apperith the^n that aftir law Civil and aftir ancient ordenaunces by
statutes and custumes of a land / our old age ought to be besyed / occupied
/ and medeled / with public offices of dignitees or pryuees / as to be
counseillours and governors of cytees and towns / so that they be such /
that men may exercise them without bodily strength / And by that we old men
be not only free to do that / which we may not / neithir we namely be
constreyned to do as much as we might do / But Scipion thou myghtist oppose
me against old age / that some old men ben so feeble that they should not mow
execute nor do any public office of dignyte or pryue perteynyng to his
living / I answer the that this vice is not propird to old age / but is to
common vices of sekenes and of nonpower of feblenesse of body Thenk Scipion how
feeble was Publyus affricans sone / which brought the up and adopted the as his
sone Thenk how by a little sykenesse he was enfeblid / which and hit had not be
come unto him / he should have be the second named in prowess and reno^me in
actys of marcialle causes aftir the noble ffabyus for the sone of Publius
ouircame and in renome surmounted his ffadir by Justice and rightwisnes and
science vsyng / whereof he had the more in his courage to mynystre and exercise
There is no merueil then if old men be sometime sekely and feeble / fith that
it was so that they of adolescentys age / and namely young men may not eschew
sickness of body / Therefore I tell you Scipion and lelyus that men must
resist to old age by cause that they might eschew and putt away dissolucion
slouthe and ydeluesse by diligent labor and study / And men must in like wise
by excercitacion and by study fight against old age by cause that it fall not
by no vicious living / like as by provisions and remedy of good dyetyng / men
fight and perserue them against sekenes of body / Old men owen to have in old
age such conduyte guydyng and mesure by moderate exercise of labor / as
seek men use to have / therefore it must be auysed that old men vsen of small
and light excercitacions and of temperat labors / Hit must also be counseilde
that old men ete and drink meets of light and good digestion / so that the
strengthis and the bodily virtues be replete and susyned and not stoppid / by
surfetes of hard metys or by surfete of drynkys / And hit nedith much more to
socour and help to the thought and passion of the soul and to the courage of
old men / by cause that by the socour that he does to such thoughtys and the
mind of good remembrance fail nor lessith not / and that be he couraged / as
he may exercise and occupye him in the thyngys parteynyng to old age / ffor
as the light of a lamp quenchith and dies / but men putt in sum oil / to the
quantite that it lessith / So the thought in which is the mind of man and the
courage of heart / wherein is the wisdom / rest stynte and fail / but if they
be socourd with such comfortable thing of pleasyre / and comfortable
excercitaco^ns of merry communycacyons as is in recordyng and redyng the bookys
of virtue / and connyng in chronicles and historyes of their noble predecessors
and bring them so again to more parfite remembrance aftir that men have redd
them / And it is certain / that as their bodies so aaged ben woxen / greuid
and weary by pain and labor / So their courages ben sustained / and releuid by
excercitaci / on of use of study of memory and mind keepyng /

ffor when Cecylius the poet in a comedy of a merry book of his says that
old men ben sottys callid / othirwise foolys / for he seith that old man
without excecitacyon of redyng or heryng good historyes / they be disposid
lightly to believe all the thyngys or tales thowh they be not profitable to
them that they here say / by cause that they have no demyng in them / and also
they be forged fulle by repleccyon of cold and fleumatike humors / and the
more by cause that they have not excercised in age the virtue of remembrance /
and also they ben noyous and dangerous strange for to please without having
of moderacion and temperaunce by cause of weykenesse of their complexion / ben
disposed / more to sekenes then they were in yongth Thies three sekenesses
come not to a man by cause of old age / but they ben the vices of the nature
of old neclygent age / as is sloth and sleep / And as to wanto^nesse / and
flesshely delectaco^n it is more the vice of young men then of old men / and
also wanto^nesse is not only the vice of adolescente men / but it is the uice
of evil disposed adolescent persons / and such aged fooly which men callyn
out of reason mysrulyd or sotted at some seasons / which condition comyth to
some old men Hit comith to such old men that were light of courage in their
yongth / and were not stable in wisdom nor in study / Appius of whom I have
spokyn before was a worshypfull priest of the temple of the goddys of Minerua /
he being blind and old governed his four sonys / which were full grown
and strong men / and his five doughtirs and a great houholde and great feliship
he kept with ontyn any help / and without counseill save only of himself /
This Appius had his courage lent and given to wisdom and to good memory as
it had be above / and to whom the bodily strengthys failed / yet he was neuir
submyttid to old age / but he entendid to study and to publyke besynes and
pryue / as in geuyng good aduices and counseill to such as had Rule and
governance of / to mynistre Justice and in keepyng good household / Appius
old and blind held souereyn rule and domynacion had upon his subiectys and
seruauntis / for they bare him reverence and doubted his puissaunce / his
seruauntys dread him / his childerne obeyed him / and all tho that haunted him
louid him / and had him in great worship and favor / and this Appius was of
courage vigorouse / and as a man given to great watch as it was in his ffader
/ and also he had and used the doctrine of him

Therefore I tell you Scipion and Lelius that the old man is to be pleasid /
and with honest to be reverenced / so that he defend him with the yefte and
tresours of memory / by study and by exsamples / by auctorite by reverence
and by the other arms of virtues living and of sciences / Old age is honest
if it hold and keep his dyuyne law / by which it is withdrawn for
haboundonyng and withdrawyng from taking him self to vices if it be well
fornysshed and supportid to his troth and complexion by which he lyuith aftir
temperaunce and reason / The old man is honest and good if he make him
governor and enfourmer of his childeren and of his main and servants unto
the last end of his lif aftir his auctorite and to his puissaunce / fforsoth
so as I approve and preyse the adolescent man / which has in him some thing
parteynyng to old age as is temperaunce and sobirnesse / Also I comende and
preyse the old man which in him has somthyng parteynyng to yongth / as is some
strength of body and constaunce of good courage The man that folowith that /
which I have above said he may be old of body / but he shall neuir be old
of courage to excercyse good deedys / I Caton which am old have now betwix
my handys the vij book wherein I trete the birthis of the ancient people of
renomme of ytayle / In this book I gadir to gedir all recordable process of
eueery noble cause that I have purposid / and studied sor to please by
aduocacye before the senators and other Iuges of rome that is to wit / like a
seriaunt of the law or the kyngys promoter or speker of his parliament or his
attorney generalle ora pprentise of court declarith and pledith his matters
that been comytted to him of thies causes / I compile and make now oracions
proposicions and plees by which I show the form and manner to you to purpose
and plede here aftir plees and causes in demaundyng and askyng right and
justice to be mynistrid or in defendyng a wrong / surmysed in causis crymynelle
and civil imperiale which is the common law in rome vsid /

I Caton which am old trete / and compile now a divine book of a law by
the which I teache how and by what cause men should make the argumentys by
reasons and writyngys of philosophers and clerks prenostiques for to come /
that is to wit the diuynacions for to know the doubtuouse thing / and
uncertain / present and by exsample as by constellacyons of coniunctyons and
aspectes of the vij planetes and by eclipses aswele of the son as of the moon
and by the introites and entrees of the son in to the xij signs of the year
passidor for to come as verry pestelences / derth of cornys oils and wynes /
and impressions of the air of great coldys and hetys / dryness or moistnes
great storms and wyndes / I trete also the right law of civil / causes and
the ordenaunces of high dignyte of bisshops and prestys how and in what wise
should be deputed and ordained to them / as in obedience and reverence that
seruen to the great goddys of the temple / I in making thies thyngys a forsaide
/ use much^ of the bookys of the grekys philosophers

I use much / also of the manner of the disciples of the philosopher pytagoras
by cause to exercise my mind of remembrance / ffor so as the mynistres and
the scolers of Pytagoras lernyd the argumentys and the speculatyf of science of
diverse co^nyngys by the space of v year / and by other five year aftir that the
seid scolers studied her doctrine without speech made to them but by the
thought and study speculatife practisyng upon the seven sciencys that they had
learned of their maistir before / And than by ten year after / they had habilite
and license to enfourme and teache other scolers and studientys / Also I record
and remember at even / all that I have said / and all that I have herd / and
all that I have do the day precedent / such be the excercysynges and workys
of my wit and also of my thought / whiles I trauaillid and labourd in thies
thyngys above said / Therefore I desire not greatly to have much strength of
body only / but I am ready to my frendys if they have need of me / I come to
the senators and to the parlementys and to open courtys accompanied with the
feliship of my brethren and frendys / I bring with me such matters and
processes that I have long before thught / also I defend my process and
matiers and also afferme the process aftir as the causes shall require before
the senators / not by the strength of my body but by the power and strength of
my wits and the courage of my heart / That is to wit / by counseill by
deliberacion by auctorite and by wisdom / and if I should not mow execute nor
bring to a due end the matters and processes of my own / as of my frendys /
Nevertheless in lying and restyng in my bed I would delight and enjoy me in
thenkyng the good conduit of thies things how be it I that should not mow
speed it incontinent / but I have so demenyd me / and lived in time past that I
might both speed in dooyng mine own process / and also tho of my frendys
matters before the senators and other officers of Justice publik within a
reasonable time / fforsoth he that lives and endurith in such studyes and in
such labors alwey as I have lived / he may not vndirstonde nor feel in what
time old age hydeth him silf within him / And by that vndirstondyng his age /
little and little growith and becomith old without that the man can neithir
parceyue nor feel it / and so his age is nothir brousyd ner brokyn suddenly by
old age / but his age streyneth and failleth by the length of the time or he
know it /

Here endith the third part and second distynctyon / and aftir begins the
fourth part / in the which our Caton answerith and confoundith the third
vituperacyon of defaute opposid to old age / and begins in latin Sequitur
Tercia distinctio / etc.
aftir the forseid two repreuis and defautys alledgid and opposid against old
age / Now folowith the iij vituperacion and defaute by the which young men
seyne / that old age is noiouse / myschaunte / and wretchid by cause it has
almost no flesshely delectacyons or sensualitees / as for to get with
childeren and issue to encrece and multiply the world / To whom I answer
forwith / that it is right a noble gift reward and the right great worship of
old age / that it be sequestered / depryued / and dischargid of the
delectacyons of sensualitee of the body or flesshely lustis / for if it be so
that old age be pryued and sequestered of such delectacyons / It had takin awey
from us old men / that thing which is right vicious and right foul in the
age of adolescence and yongthe /

And neuerthelesshe my right good and loving young men Scipion and Lelius / an
ancient senator purposid an oracion / that a philosopher callid Archites made
which was takyn of Haniballe duc of cartage when he werrid in ytaile / he was
recouerde by Quintus ffabius the noble senator when he recouerd tarente /
takyn by the said Haniballe / Archites was pryncypally a great man connyngly
lernyd in sciences and in virtues and was right famous and noble / this oracion
purposid / which archites made was yeuen to me / when I adolescent and young of
age was at tarente with the seid ffabius / and by this oracyon seid archites
that nature which ordained to men complexions / gave neuir no pestelence pain
nor turment / more damageable to young men than is flesshely delectacyon / the
coueitous playsirs of delectacyon mouen tyce and steeren men over boldly and
without bridell of reason or shame or any restraynt to execute and make an
end of their foul lustys / for thought / delectacyons ben made and conspired
treasons divisions and dissencyons of countrees and the destruccions of their
common profit / and the secrets of parlementys disclosed to our enemies and
aduersarye party / there is noon untruth / there is noon evil work / but
pleasyre of delectacyon which shall constrayne men to incline thereto / by cause
that they enioyen out of mesure of spousehode brekyng and that so fervently /
The cause of defoulyng of maidens virgins the anontry of weddyd women and all
such corrupt untrue werkys / which ben neuir meuid nor vndirtakyn / but by
the insolence and wantownes and wenlacys of flesshely delectacyon / Archites
also said / that as nature by power / of which god has yeuen to men noth^yng
bettir than is the soul / by the which they have vndirstondyng and mind / al
so to that soul which is an office and agift dyuine / nothing is so great
enemy nor so contrary as ben flesshely delectacyons / for since delectacyon
and flesshely pleasir have dominacyon in the regyon of man / That is to wit in
the courage of his body / the virtue of attemperau^ce may not be lodgid therein
/ and wthin the regyon of man which is yeuen to delectacyon may not abide any
wisdom nor virtue / and by cause that this thing may be vndirstonde /
Archites would that some should feign and ymagyne in his courage and conceyte
that some were meuid by some delectacyon of body as great as any man might preue
it and know it then / There is no doubt said he / but while the man is geuyn
to such sensualite / which shall enjoy of that delectacyon as plainly and as
largely as any man might enjoy of it / that then he should not mow demean
him in vndirstondyng nor in mind / neithir he should mow be of power to
vndirtake any thing of woryship nor proffite to perform by reason nor by any
good auise / And therefore seid Archites / that there is nothing so cursed nor so
unfortunate as delectaco^n of body immeasurably used / And if ye delectacyon
which is little and short / were gretter and longer / it would quench and
bring to naught all the light of the courage and of the clerenesse of the life
/ And know ye Scipion and lelius / that one of mine hosttes callid Nearcus
Citezeyn of tarent / which had be long in the friendship of allyaunce of the
people of rome / said that he herd tell to more ancient men than he was /
that the said Archites pronounced the wordys here before wretyn in disputyng of
delectacyon with Gayus Poncyus ffader of the seid Archites and citezein of
Sannice a cite of Poyle / This Poncius was so worthy and so manly that in a
battle made before Candy he discomfited two consuls romans / That is to wit
Spurius Postumus and Titus veturius / and Archites disputed of delectacyon in
the presence of the philosopher Platon an athenys man / That is to wit a clerk
of Atheenes that then was come to Tarent so as I find by the reportys of
Lucius Canubus and of Appyus Claudyus consuls romans / if ye ask me to what
entente / the things that I have here disputed against delectacyon draw and
stretchyn / I answer you that they belongen and drawn to thentente that ye
vndirstonde that if we men may not despise and flee delectacyons of body by
mean of reason and of wisdom / we should greatly thank old age since that he
may do so much / that flesshely delectacyon should displease which is
vncouenable to any man young and old / Delectacion of body lettith the
deliberacyon of good cou^seill / It is the enemy of reason / It shyttith
fast and closes the eyes of the thought and courage which conteyneth
vndirstondyng and ready mind of remembrance / Nevertheless delectacyon has
no bargeyne with virtue / I caused ones almost great maugre mysilf by as much
that I castid out of the college of the senatous Gayus fflamyneus brothir of
Titus fflamyneus consul of rome / aftir that the said Gayus had be seven year
consul to the intent that I should show that he was vituperable and defamed by
cause that he folowid delectacyon of body immeasurably / ffor where as the seid
Gayus had be by the romans sent as consule in the country of gauls / and he
syttyng at board was exhorted by a rebawde stotte of his / that he should do
smite to the heart with a daggar one of his prisoners condemned to dye / This
Gayus scapid to be deed by sentence / but he lost his office of consul by the
sentence of his brothir Tytus being then Judge of Rome / which before me had
be next consul / This delectacyon is so evil and so damageable which so was
repreuyd by me and by flattus at that time consuls romans / Since that the same
delectacyon was in a man which had such syngler repreef and such defame and
shame / and the which with that was in lordship and in dygnyte of offices /
other of like degree and worship or benethe her degrees / owght right greatly
pondre and consider in their mind / to putt awey such flesshely delectacyons
/ I have often herd say of our ancient ffaders / tho things which they at
that time when they were childerne had herd seye to old men / That is to wite
that where as a cytezeyne of rome callid ffabricius herd a cytezeyn of the
country of Thessayle say / that in the study of Athenes was one Epicurus
which callid him silf a philosopher / and mayntened an oppynion / that all
things that we do in souereynte should be chiefly come^did and reported to
delectacyon of the body / Of that oppynion the seid ffabrycius merueylyd him /
and to old men recounters said / that Marcus curyus and Titus Cormicacyus
hieryng / that which I have said before / They two which in time paste had
habondouned and disposid them to sensualite / and to delectacyon of flesshely
lustis / they were wont to desire that the oppynion of Epycurus should be in
semblable wise exhorted affermid and said to the samytoys and to king Pirhus
their lord / by cause that ye samyto is and king Pirhus enemies to the romans
should be abandouned and disposed to the delight of lecherye / which feblith and
takith awey the bodily strengthis of the body / This Marcus curious / which in
his time ordained him unto delectacyon that he had lyuid and conuersid with
Publius decyus that lived virtuously and chastely / and by five year before
that the seid Curyus was consul / the seid Publius decyus with plain will of
good courage habandouned and offird him to the death for the sauacyon of the
publyke well and common profit of rome then when that he was consul the
fourth time Gayus ffabricius and Coruucacyus knew the good knight decyus /
Thies tweyne ffabricyus and Cornucacyus might certainly Judge and deem aswele by
the conuersacyon as by the noble dedys of decyns / whereof he says that sum
thing is naturally so fair and so precious and noble / that it must be sought
and desired with plain heart and effectuell desire And that thing so fair and
so gracious is noon other thing but lawde and fame of virtue / which is such
that for that cause every right good and well disposed person ought to despise
and rebuke delectacyon of the body to thentente that he use lawde and preysyng
of virtue / Therefore then ye may ask and demand why I have said so many
things of flesshely delight and of lecherye / wherefore I answer you / that the
blame and the shame is not only enough / But namely it is the great lawde and
praysyng of old age that it desires but little flesshely delectacyons / Old
age chargith neuir of dyetes nor of diverse deynty metys nor of tables richely
and dyuersly arrayde nor of many dyners drynkys / Old age will not be fulle
of wyn often for doubt of sekenes / Old age will not suffer the akyng of the
belly as is the colyk or of the stone or costyfnes / which comyth of taking
somuche mete and so often / that it abides raw within the stomach / Old age
desyrith not wakyng in the time that nature has ordained to sleep / Al be it
an aged man is greatly disposed to wake against his will / fforsoth the
philosopher Platon which spoke dyuersly in a matter that delectacyon attempted
by evil disposed men / that leyen the bait and the snare to delight aged men
in repleccion of lustis and metys not helefull to them / and by cause that men
be taken and deceived by the bait set in the hoke or angle as the bird is
taken in the snare / how be it that old age would have no metys ne his etyngys
excessiuely / Algatys they may delight in deynte metys and in small feedyngys
and temperate dyete /

At the time when I was young I saw often an old consul of rome callid Gayus
duellius which was the first that discomfited by nauye and shippys upon the sea the aufricans / when he came from soper and dinner he oftentimes delited in
the instrumentys of music as playeng upon strengys of harpes / and such like
melodyes and in heeryng the sown of pipes and trompys / Also he had takin
only for his delectacyon and solasthies two plays without / that he had seen
any ancient men to delight or disporte them with any other honest solas / and
that license and use of honest delectacyon had duellius by cause of his
glorious victory / by the which he discomfited them of aufrik / But it is not
need also to remember in what things the other old men tokyn their honest
delectacyons / Therefore I shall come again to speak of myself / ffor from mine
yongthe I have always had fellows and acqueynted of virtuous disposid men / And
aftir that I was in the office of questour at Rome / I was ordained in the
feleshipps and acqueyntances of young men / And in that same time the romans
resceyued of them of ffrige / the manner to sacrifye to the goddess /
Berchinchia which is the great mother of the gods / I drank and ete with my
fellows temperately and mesurably without any excess / But within me was yet
an hete of yongth / but in as much that it procedith euir in approchyng and
coming of mine old age / all the delectacyons of the body hit appesith and
softeth / And know ye that I did not rek nor took any charge / more of the
delectacyons of metys and drynkys of wynes / not only for the delectacyon of
my body / but in specyalle that I did more for the delectacyon and
contemplacyon that I took in the feliship of my frendys / and also in their
reasons and their wise and frendely comunicacyons for the solas of my soul /
And consider ye Scipion and Lelius that our ancient ffaders of worship /
which have set their names as a brethirhede or a gylde to such assembles
named / at the feste that is well and proprely callid in latin Conuiuium /
which is desyrid prayed and gaderd / of frendely people in drynkyng and etyng
at table as they would themself say or desire / that the feleship of the same
company / ought to have a custumable and a continuell assembled lif at
convenient days assigned / The grekisshe people seid not so well of such
festis making / for in the stead of such companyes and congregacyons they
said / that it was ordained for to ete and drynk to gedir / as the seid grekys
would approve / and say that such etyng and drynkyng as sowned to delight
pryncypally in metys and drynkes / is the least thing to account amongys the
company of frenship showing and friends / Therefore I tell you Scipion and
lelius that I delight me in couenable thyngys well ordained and approuued festes
by the delectacyon that I have to speak with my fellows and frendys for our
solacys and comfort / and that they have with me / and yet I delight me not
oonly with mine of age / ffor now there be of them right few that be living /
but I delight me with them of your age and also with you / I owe also to yield
great grace thankyngis and praysynges to old age / which has encreced / and
multiplied in me the desire to speak with my fellows and frendys / But if ye
ask what is my sentence / if some old men deliten them in etyng and drynkyng /
I answer that by cause that ye thynk not that I would move werre and
dyspleaser against all delectacyon by cause that no man should use of hit /
know ye Scipion and lelyus that I vndirstonde not nor will not / that old age
be destituded of his natural lufte / and desire by any thing that it
mynysshith and bessith all the delectacyons which as be in drinkyng and etyng
/ ffor to some men befallyn parauenre some delectacyons which folowyn and
continue with them naturell manner founded / and grounded in honest of
conditions / ffor I take delectacyon to have the dignytees and offices ordained
by our predecessors / I take delectacyon in the wordys of the maistre stuard
or of the botiler of the house / when he prays me or comaundeth me to dyne or
take a repaste for his lord or his masters sake orellys to drink for some
man's sake aftir the custume be of our predecessors / and also I delight me in
the standing cuppys half fulle of cold wine / aftir the custume that an auctor
of greece callid Exenophon wrote in a book of his named Simoposium / in which
he treteth and shows how men shude make their drynkynges emongys frendys and
felows / I delight me in somer time to feel the cold wind / and also in winter
time I delight me to be oon time in the son shynyng / and anothir time to be
at fire / fforsoth also I follow thies delectacyons a forsaide when I am in
my village with the sabynoys my neygh^bours / and I make every day meetings /
steuyns / and assemblees of my neighbors when I am at sabynes / and we endure
sometime long for the most that we may at our meetyngys / tylle a great part
of the night be passed / as in spekyng of many thyngys and of diverse matters

And if thou say Scipion that the delectacion of bodily delites / is not so
great in the corages of old men / that it might stere them or meue them to
lecherye or other sensualitees of the body / for if thies delectacyons be over
great / it should then seem that thou shall desire nothing / but that it be
angwisshouse and soroufull in courage / The philosopher Sophocles which for
cause of age was feeble / answerde well and pertynently to one that askid him if
he used any more of delites of lecherye and of sensualytee of the body / I pray
god said Sophocles / that he give me fortune to desire better things / for I
have with draw fro me / and fled awey from delytes of lecherye as a man should
flee and withdraw him fro some strange lord madd or furyous / And know ye
Scipion and Lelyus that it is parauenture chargeous thing and enoyouse to young
men that be couetouse of the delites of lecherye if they may not enjoy them /
But to old men that be weary and replete of such delytes / it is more joyful
thing to be sequestered / pryued / and quyted / thereof than for to use and
enjoy in that / how be it that they be not deprived of bodily delytes / that
they desire them / neuir I say then that it is more joyful thing to desire
not the delectacyons / than it is for to have them / but if the age of good and
honest yongth use of thies delectacyons / it is used more gladly first of some
little and small delectable things as we have said here before / And aftir
that the good young men delited / them in this honest delectacyon / wherein old
age uses not habondauntly and plainly of bodily delites / yet be they / not
all for that pryued nor for boden thereof / as ye may see by this forsaide
exsample There is a man at rome callid Turpis Albinius which pleyeth and
counterfetyth the pagentys / when the poetys syngen enterludes in plays or
tragedyes of soroufull lamentacyons / or other ditees in verses / in the place
callid the scene or the teatre / the tent or pauilyon / he than which is in
the first stage nygh the pleyar / has great delectacyon in the wordys and in
the countenance of the pleyar / But also he deliteth theryn that is in the
last stage and in the ferthist of the tente or playng place /

Also I tell the Scipion that the age of adolescencye which lokith nygh the
delectacyons / gladith parauenture more than anothir age does But also old
age which sees from far the delectacyons / he takith a delight in it /
as much as it suffiseth / But and ye ask / what arn worth the young
delectacyons that old age takith / and which be so ferr from the body / I
answer you that thies small pleasurs deliten not the body / but they deliten
the courage which is the most excellent part of a man /

The small honest delectacions as old men say / maken the courage to be
myghtyer and to live longer and strength the man / for then ceesen the wages
and sawlde of lecherye / of couetyng / of contempcions of strives / of
enemytees / and of all couetyfe / as it be falls / like as it comyth to
knyghtys and to chief officers which aftir sixti yeris ben dischargid out of
their offices and comen to rest / There is then nothing more joyful than is
old age / and honest ydilnes and restyng / so that it have feedyng and
refectyon of study of sapience and wisdom / and some doctrine for to teache
to other tho things that he had learned in young age / Remember the Scipion by
how many times we saw that worthy man Gallus familier and homely with thy fader
which was so old / that it semyd that he should dye / and yet he continued by
delectacyon in the study of geometrye and astronomye which be two sovereign
sciences for to mete and mesure the proporcions of heaven and the earth and of
the distance in courses of the sterrys / and of her coniunctyons opposicions
and aspectys by the sixth part iiij part or third part in aspectys castyng her
lights and influences from other / and what the seid coniunctyons and aspectes
signyfien upon thyngys to come / as hete cold / raynes dryness / and wyndes /
derthes / pestilences / and other infirmytees / And to know the conuenyent
days and times of mynistring of medicines / as laxatyues / dygestiues /
expulsifs / and retentifs / and the days callid Dies cretici and dies of
prenostikes of good determynacions / of the passions of a man's sikenesse or the
contrary / Remember the Scipion by how many times this Gallus by delectacyon
has bego^ne by night some conclusions of thies two sciences so long that the
day came unawarely upon him / and oftentimes he wrote and studied endyng to the
night / and yet had he begone in the morning / he took great delectacyon for to
tell us the effectys of the eclipse of the son and of the moon long before
that it should come and befalle / Thou wotest also how Gallus delited him in
study of light sciences callid trynals / as be gramer logyk and rethorik in
comparison of the quadryiuall sciences / as ars metryk for nombres / Geometry
for mesurs / Musik for syngyng / and astronomye for diuinacyons / as is before
specifyed / But they be sharp and subtyle / and owght te be in virtuous men's
lernyng well disposid / Thou knowist also how that old man Nenyus delited him
in a book which he endited and made / of a bataile done by the romans against
them of cartage / Thou knowist also how the poet Plantus delited him in two
comodies made in balade and enterludes that he made / whereof the one is callid
Terencius and the other Sendulus / In the first he treteth of the cruelte of a
servant against his master / and in the other he treteth of the falsnes of a
bond man against his lord /

I have seen also an old poet callid Lenyus / which in the study of rome
taught to his scolers / one of his fables of a comedye in balade and interlude
/ by six year or I was borne / And yet the seid Lenyus proceeded and continued
in fair age unto the time of mine adolescente age / at the time when Tonus and
Tudycanus were consuls at rome / What will thou Scipion that I tell the of the
labor and of the study of the old man Publius lucinius / which wrote and
treteth of dyuine law aftir the which the bisshops and preestis of the temple
ought to sacryfie and to serve the gods / Lucinius also wrote and tretid of
law civil aftir which men must govern and rule the cytees and countrees /
or what will thou that I tell the of the labor and of the study of this
Scipion Mysica now an old man all ready to depart from the world / which
now has be chosen and ordained the most grettist bishop of rome ffor
certainly we have seen all thies which I have remembrid to the / that were
old men having a sharp and a fervent desire in entendyng the occupacyons that
I have seid / in the which they had pleasyrs and honest delectacyons / Thenk
also Scipion in how great labor of study I saw full besye this old man
Marcus Thetegus to whom the poet Ennimis callid him his sweet honey / by cause
that his book was so retoriquel^y made / and was of the said Thetegus endited /
by fair and sweet langage in eloquent terms / which enforced men hieryng his
purposyngys / to incline and bow them to believe all that he had purposid and
told / Ye may then see and know / what be the delectacyons of metys drinkys
and of plays / and also of folissh^ women and ribaldes / to regard of well
disposed people of sad governance / and how great in comparison of the moralle
virtuous men / that be disposed for to study for the auauncement of the common
prouffite and of other seven craftys of sciences wherein the wise old men that
I have named above / delited greatly / fforsoth thies studyes of doctrine and of
sciencys followed and folowyth the wise men well ordained in condicyons / And
also thies studyes of doctrine have been and be such that they encrecen and
multiplye semblaby and egally with the aged men / in so much that the good and
honest sentences said by the philosopher Solon that is preuid true as I have
said before /

This philosopher Solon seide that he becam wise in lernyng alwey many things
by study / which he neuir had known before / There is not forsooth no gretter
delectacyon / than is that / by the which the wise old men learn somewhat by
exercise as did the right wise philosopher Solon / Aftir that I have spoken
now hier of the studyes / and of the occupacions wherein wise men and letterd
have had / and may have honestees and pleasirs and delectacyons / I come now
to speak of delectacyons that wise old men may have in labouragys and culture
and approwment of londys / wherein I delight me more than any man would or might
believe / Old age lettith not the delectacyons and the great joy and pleasirs
that grown and come of the labourage and tillyng of the landys / and they be
such that as it semith me they be right nygh neighbors to the life of a man /
ledyng the lif of a philosopher / ffor wise old men proceden by naturelle
reason in the labourages and tillyng of landys / and the earth refusith not nor
disobeyeth the naturelle werkyng to the comaundementis of the wise old men
laborers / ffor the earth has resceyued / and is sowed it yeldith neuir
without usure of manyfolde werkyng the same / That is to wit that the earth
yeldith the double as the second greyn the third / and the iiij until the
viij greyne and not only the simple again / But the earth in some time yeldith
that / which he has resceyued of the greynes and seedys in less usure of
encrece / and some time in multiplying encrece gretter / And how be it that the
earth yeldith that / which it resceyued / with usure of encrece /
neuirthelesse the fruytes of the earth deliten me / not only in that great
encrece / but namely it delited and ioyeth me to know the virtue / and the
naturell growyng and workyng by the which the earth gendrith thyngys
necessaryes and helthfull to men and to bestis / And when the earth resceyueth
the seed sown in his lap softed and beddid / then it is closid first and
syttyth fast so that the seed be couird by the instrument of the ploughe / or
by the harowe / and in the time / in which men sown seedys and couern the
corn / for that cause / it is callid the time and season of sowyng / according
to the custume and nature of diverse countres / aftir that the seed is heeted /
by the naturell moisture of the earth and thorough the heete of the son / and
also by the spraynture of dewys of norisshyng that the earth does to the seed
/ and to the plantys which is with all couird / the earth brekith and castith
out of that seed an herb growyng grene / which puttyth and spredith within
the earth small rootys / the and stokkes of the stalks grown and wexen aftir
great / little and little / and aftir rises and comyth in to a spryng and a
stalk full of knottys / and wh^^ne it comith to the first erys and buddis /
hit is closed with small leaves like here is / and aftir that the seed is remeuid
and goon out of thies leaves / it castyth an ere in which the whete corn or
other greyns ben ordained and renged ordynatly in such wise that one corn
puttith not out that other / and by cause that the small briddes shull not
lightly ete nor waste the corn / the ere is armed with the closyng of prickis
/ In which things to know and to exercise and occupye / The old age may
take great exsample of naturell werkyng and honest delectacyon / why should I
remember the delectacyons and pleasirs that old age may take in considering
and knowing the nature of the vynes / the manner of the settyngys and of the
shredyngys and cuttyngys of hit in season / ffor to thentente ye know the
rest and the delight of mine old age / I tell you that I may not be weary nor
fulfilid of the dlectacion that I take in the labourages of corn and of the
vynes / I leave to tell what delectacyon old age takith in knowing and
considering the virtue and the naturell strength of all things that be
genderd on earth / ffor of a small grain of a fig or of a little small pepyn
or kernel of a roysyn or of a small corn of whete or of any other seedys or
of some small wandes and braunchis the earth engenders great tronkes and great
trees and bows / I demand you Scipion and Lelius if the new blossomys and
buddys of the vine / if that the sapys that men settyn again to the shredyngis
that men cuttyn of the vynes charged with grapes the rootys which spredyn
aswele without as within the earth / and the plantys that thicken the vine /
yeuen not only delectaco^n Inough^ and pleasirs to the old men / so that they
will consider in merueilyng them of the things a boue said / O thing may give
to old age honest delectacyon / that is to wit how the vine / which
naturally fallith down to the ground / but it be vndirsett and sustained / it
mounteth and growith high / and all that it ouirtaketh it beclippith and
enbraceth with his tendrenes so as if it had the craft and hands And the
laborers of the vynes aftir their craft / art and reason / kepyn that the
vine grow not / but aftir reason nor out of mesure / for they cut it with
the vine hook / when it drawith or hangs upon the ground / or when it
departed excessiuely in diverse and crooked branches / by cause that the vine be
not to thik by ouir great branches and that it stretche not in to many parties
/ And at the beginning of the season of veer and of spryngyng / the vine
growith to the branches which be left in the stocks / and in the knottys of
the brau^chis comith a watir that men call Iennue / whereof aftir that sewith
the burgeon whereof the grape comith / and this grape which by the moistness of
the earth and by mean of the heete of the son begins to wexe great and is
at the beginning bettir and sour to the taste / and aftir that it is ripe / it
shewith sweet / and then it is clothed with leaves whereof the grape resceyueth
the heete well temperately / and also is defendid and kept from to great
brennyng of the son /

I see not forsooth how any delectacyon might be more ioyouse nor gladder than
is the fruit of the vine nor fairer for to see / And know ye Scipion and
Lelius / that so as I have here before said the fruit of the vine makes me
not oonly to have delight / But namely the labourage and the nature of the vine
in burgenyng such deliciouse licours closed in grapes / deliten to me for to
see / the rengis of the stakes that sustain the vine / to bind or end egally
as the other to attache and bind every tymbre and branch to his own propre
stake / and the growyng of the vynes and the cuttyng of the branches Whereof
some arn take away for to brenne and the other be kept / for to set again in
other places / which makyn to me great delectacyons and pleasirs / It nedith
not that I tell what delectacyons and pleasirs be to old age / the dongyng and
the dyghtyng of the londys with the superfluyte that is voyded of bestis and
sheep / that men make to be spredde in a field / by which doongyng and
compostyng / the feldes gladeth / the ground wexith more fructuous and
plenteuouse / What nedith that I seek of the delectacyon that old men may have
of the prouffite that comith to donge and fat the lands and feldes / I have
spokyn of dongyng of lands in oon of my bookys which I have wretyn to the
labourage of the feeldys and of the doongyng of the lands / A wise auctor
callid Hefredus said neuir oon word ydely nor vain thereof / whe^n he wrote
his book of earth tilying / that men say of the labourage and tyllyng of the
feldes / But the poet Omer which was as me semyth by many yeris before
Hefredus / which was oon of thoo that taught the manner for to labor and
tylle the lands and fruytes and the things that grow of it / After whom
Uirgile the poet wrote a book callid Giorgika

That Omer by his versys says that Lacertes king of ytacye in greece / ffader
of king Ulixes had right sweet pleasir in oon of his sons / which labored the
culture of the earth tilyeng and donged oon of his feeldys / whereof it was the
more joyful and more fertile and plenteuous in multiplyeng of corns and
fruytes / And know ye Scipion and Lelius that the thyngys and werkys and
besinesse of laborers of the lands and feeldes be gladsom and pleasant not
oonly by thencreces of whetys and cornys / nor by the meadows full of gras nor
by the vynes full of grapes nor by diverse small and young trees bryngyng forth
fruytes / But also the things and the werkys of the laborers be gladsome and
delectable / by the gardeynes full of diverse herbys flowers and seedys / by the
curtilages gardyns and orchardes planted and greffed with diverse trees / and by
the norisshyng and feedyng of bestis in fair grene meadows and pastures / and
by the hyues of bees keeping and norisshing of them which makyn wax and honey /
by a meruelouse werkyng of their kind / and by the dyuersitee of all flours
and of diverse colors of roses / And not old men have delectacyon of the trees
that they set / or that they do to be set / but also they deliten themsilf
to set a tree / and greffe it upon annothir / which is the most subtle and
most artificial thing that euir was found by laborers of the land / And now
I will tell many delectacyons and many pleasirs which be in the labourages of
the feeldys / But the delectacyons that I have above told be longer and more
durable than be the other which I leave to tell / I trust Scipion and Lelyus /
that ye shall pardone me by cause that I am a long speker of an earth tilleir
in tellyng the delectaco^ns which come and grow of the labourages of londys /
and to thentent that it semith not that I would defend and make old age to be
free of all vices / I tell you that old age aftir nature and kind / spekith
and determyneth more than any other age / And for to have such delectacyons /
this noble man romayn Marcus curious would were out / and endure forth to the
end of the remenau^t of his old age in labourages of lands aftir that he had
resceyued at rome the honor and the worship of tryumphe for the victory that
he had of the Samytois of the sabynoys and of Purrus king of Epirotes / the
which the seid Curious desco^fited by bateyll / when I consider the village and
also the great labouryng in lands / of the seid marcus curious / which be nygh
un to mine / I may not merueil to greatly of the perseverance of the seid Marcus
curious / nor of the study and solicitude / which he had in his time about the
thyngys pertynent to labourage and tyllyng of his londys / It fortuned oones
that the said Curious sat by his fire / to whom the samytois had brought a
great some of gold for to make him a present then / But Curious the worthy
man being full of noble courage refused their yift so presented to him and
set not by them nor of their yiftes in gold / and said to the samitois / that
it semid unto him naught / though it were rich and right a fair sight nor it
is no noble thing to a governor of a country to have a great hepe or a
qua^tite of gold all only / But it was right fair and a more noble thing to
a souerayn captayn using werre for to be lord of the men within the country
that have gold and other riches / Tell me Scipion and Lelius / if ye thenk
not / that since marcus curious had so great and so noble courage in disputyng of
couetyse and refusyng yiftis and rewards / he might well have but gladsonmesse
and mirth of his old age / which is only joyful / when the old man knowith
him silf to have lived euir well and virtuously / and has had his desire in
welthe and worship to live in delites profitable and honest / But I have much
to speak of the delites and pleasirs that old men have / in knowing / vsyng
and hawntyng the labourages of lands / And of this matter I speak by cause I
goo not to ferr fro mine occupaco^n which am a labourer and a tyller of londys
in mine age / Whilom the senators / that is to wit the old romans / which
dwelled in villages upon their lordshipps / And at the time when Lucius Quintus
then an old man eryed tylled and labored in oon of his feeldes / a messager
was sent to him and denounced him as to let him wit / that the senators of
rome had by their electyon chosyn him for to be dictatour / which was at rome
the grettist of the offices as chief Judge of the land to admynystre Justice to
the people / And by the commandment of this Quyntus dictatour Gayus seruylius
then master of the knygthis at rome / slew a knight romayne Spuryus melius
/ which stood about knyghtys armed by cause that the seid spuryus would take
to him the governance of the reame of romans / men callid also in semblable
wise Curyus of whom we have spokyn for to bear office of dignyte to assemble
and come again to Rome with the senators aoccmpanyed / After that time when he
had dwellid in his village upon the approwyng of his lands / and the
sergeantys that so^moned and callid auncien men romans to the senate for to be
cou^seillours for the common prouffite / were named journey men and ryders / as
messagers pursiuau^tes and sergeau^tys / Therefore I demand you Scipion and
Lelius / if the old age of such as delited them in the labourage of lands
semyth unto you to be wretched or lothfull / I say aftir my sentence and auise
/ that I know not if any old age may be better ne more blessed / than is this
/ which deliteth men in labouryng and approwmentys of lands / for thencrecyng
of fruytes of lands tillyng / which by his auise is not only prouffytable
and wholesome to all mankind / but the labourage of londys is good and
profitable and helthfull to his body / by the delectacyon in excercisyng the
tyllyng of hymsilf / It recouerith naturelle heete to warm his stomach and his
body as I have more ample before said / and also the labourage of lands is
good / and profitable for the refection prouffite and habondaunce of all
things / that belongen to the multiplyeng of vitaill and sustenau^ce for
living to men / Then sethin that old men desiren the delectacyons and
pleasirs which be in the labourages and tyllyng of londys / then be we
graciously disposed in such profitable werkys of delectacyon according to
old age fforsoth in the house of a good and dilligent old lord laborers have
ordained his manoirs and lordships to be well approwed by plantyng fruytes
tyllyng eryng / sowyng / and gardenyng / and in their heruest and vindages /
with their bestis and catailles norisshing stored / as the seler is euir
stored with wynes syders and oils / and the bernys with the garners euir
stored of corns and vitaylles necessaryes to the sustenaunce and living of man
/ and all the villages as the tenauntes of the seid good / and delygent
ancient lords be rich and stuffid plenteuously / and also has great
habondaunce and plente of beefs and motous porkys for larde and kedys lambys
swannys partryches hennys capons and of other pullaile and of other foulys of
diverse kinds / also of mylk of cheesys and of honey by the bees in hyues in
places which the laborers of lands callen now their curtylages / The second
thought and solicitude of aged men is for to say that the laborers will / that
aftir the labourage of the feeldes be done and sped / Then that men put to
labor the curtilages of gardeyns for their herbage of herbys of diverse
colors and of diverse complexions and in orchardes making for to plant and to
set trees of fruytes bryngyng forth / as oils pomegarnades / orenges / figs
dates / almandes / pomecedres / pechys / apples / perysquynces medelers /
chesteynes / and other such fruytes of diverse kinds / thies be goodys of kind
here above named and rehearsed / which come by the study and diligent
occupacyon of agood labourer in the land / a man may namely thenk / to be come
more rich and more delectable by that occupacyon / than by a besinesse or a
werk which is superfluyous vain and ydill / That is to wit / by hawkyng
fowlyng of bryddes and huntyng of wild bestis which belongith unto young men /
What will ye Scipion and lelius say if I tell you of the delectaco^n and
pleasyre / which old age may have by cause of the grenesse of the medews or
of the fair rows in which arn set the trees of diverse kinds and frutys I
shall tell you upon that / my sentence in short words / There is no thing
that may be more plenteuous nor more habondaunt in usage for the prouffite to a
ma^nys living / nor any thing more semblable to naturelle beauty and fairnes /
than is a cloos of frutys well tillyed and labored / Old age lettyth not to
labor well a cloos planted with fruytes of diverse kinds / for their
sustenaunce / But namely old age sterith and yeuith courage to the old man
for to labor well the land / ffor sith that in winter time the old man
labourer may as redely for his health and comfort warm him to the son shynyng
upon the earth / or at the fire / which is a thing more couenable to old age
/ than to any other age / Or since that the old man labourer may withdraw him
to the shadows / or for to find the heete / or for to find the cold / or
that in somer time he may refresshe him with watirs or othirwise more sykyrly /
than the young man which has his hot blood boyllyng / I say that delectacyon
sterith and yeuith courage to the old man to labor in the lands /

Then ye Scipion and Lelius may not say the contrary / but young men have
for them for their solas and worship / their armours / their horsys / their
speris / pollaxis mallys / and Instrumentys of iren / or of leed / and
launcegayes for to fight / And also maryners in vsyng the sea / and young men
deliten in shippys bargys of diverse fassions and in rowynges and in sayllyng in
watirs and ryuers and in the sees / and some young men vsen the course of voyages
in gooyng rydyng and iourneyeng from one counttre to anothir / and among many
other labors of plays sportys and of diverse solacys / The young men also /
leuyn to the use of old men / the play at the tablis and chesse / and the
philosophers play by nombre of arsmetrike as is made mention in the book of
Ouide de vetula callid the reformacion of his life / But we demand the Caton
/ if the old men may goodly use and when we be old of thies two said plays
of the tablis and chesse / I answer you nay / for without thies two plays
ol^de age may well be stuffid and fulfillyd of all other goodness perteynyng to
felicite and to blessidnesse / Now it is so that old age and yche other age
vsyng of discression ought not to do any thing / but that it draw and be
long to virtues and to blessidnesse instead of plays at tables and at
chesses / Ye Scipion and Lelyus may read the bookys of the philosopher xenophon
/ which be right profitable to many things And I pray you that ye will
read them so as ye do now al ready / and read diligently how Xenophon prayseth
much to labourage of lands in a book of his named the book of Economike /
wherein he declares how the man ought to govern keep and approwe his own
propre londys and goodys / And to thentent that ye vndirstonde the sum of the
seid book / which the philosopher Xenophon made / Know ye he says / that to
noble and puissant men in worship and to rialle astates / there is nothing so
worthy nor so welbecomyng them / as is the study and the craft for to labor
and approwe the londys to be plenteuouse / for the life of a labourer as it is
said / is like the life of a philosopher / in so much as he serchith and
enquereth the causes naturell whereby the land thorugh burgenyng might be
fertile and plenteuouse / and also his labor is continuell and proffitable to
all creatures and so it ought to be of every king and prince and other states
of noblesse / and yet there is no craft nor any work so leefulle nor so honest
to a king or to a sovereign / as is to provide and ordeyne the labourage of the
feeldys / for namely in bataile the handys of a labourer be more harder and
stronger to endure / than of any other man / The ph^ilosopher Socrates in one
of his bokys in which he spekith with the poet Tritobolus / seith that litil
Cirus king of peer was excellent in wit and gloriouse in erthly lordshipps /
In the time of that king Cirus / a man of the cytee of lacedomone in greece
callid lisander / wh^iche was a man of right great virtue and noblenes came in
an ambassade for to see the same king Cirus / at that time being at sardes his
cytee / to whom Lisander brought clothes of gold and rich Iewelles from the
lacedomonies and from the cytees adioynant that were of his feliship / And
Socrates said that this king Cirus was fulle benyngne and curtays to the seid
Lisander to come to his noble presence / and resceyued him worshipfully and
liberally in his rialle palais / and for his most rialltee in such richessis
that he delited most in / not in tresour of gold of precious stones ne of
other great richesse that he had great plentee / he delited not therein / but in
the richesse of tyllyng and labourages of londys and fruytes of trees of diverse
kinds he showed him a cloos wallid all about diligently and connyngly
labored / tylled / planted / and set with trees of diverse fruytes beryng /
where as Lisander merueilled him of the length and bewte of the trees and for
their right renges planted and keepyng a mesurable order in dymencyon / which
trees were set five foot one from anothir / and also Lisander merueilde him of
the aleyes and walkyng places and the ground of that cloos was so well pared /
doluyn and made clean / set / and planted / with herbys of diverse kinds of
sweet flauours and odours excellent of beautes in leuis flouris / and colors /
for the softness and the swetnesse of aromatique savors came out of the
flowers of diverse kyndys / as of violettys rosemarynes maiorons / gylofres /
basiles lillium conuallium etc. / He said to the king Cirus that he merueilid
not only ffor the diligence and study of him that had labourde it / But he
namely merueilid of the subtilite and craft of him which had compassed and
ordained by due mesure the setting and plantyng of the trees of that cloos /
Then king Cirus answered to Lisander / forsooth said he / I have myself
ordained and mesured all thies things of this cloos / and also I have
compassid and proporcioned the renges of them / and many also of these trees
that ye see here / be set and greffid with mine own handys / And Socrates
tellith that Lisander in lookyng upon the gown of purpure of king Cirus / and
the clean beauty and goodlynes of his body / and the array which he bare in
the manner and wise accustomed of the country of Perse / which was weuid with
gold thyk / and with many precious stonys garnysshid and richely couchid /
and purposed in thies words to king Cirus / fforsoth said Lisandre / men seyen
rightfully and truly that thou art rich and fortunat happy and blessid in thy
life / for to thy virtue and nobilnes royal is conjoined to gedir fortune and
wordly felicitee / by cause that thou employest the and occupyest to labor
the feeldys to be rich and plenteuouse / wherein is the pryncipall part of
worldly blessidnesse / Since than that of thies fortune and blessid disposicion
which king Cirus then old / might lefully use and work in londys tyllyng /
and that he delited him therein to make his reame plentefull and rich / I tell
you Scipion and lelius that it is leefull to the old aged men of high astate
as of other mean degree / to use and to take delectacion in labouryng the
lands / and yet it is true that old age lettith not / but yeuith old men
might to maynten contynewe and perform unto the end of our age the study and
by counseyllyng the offices of diverse crafts of all things to be wrought and
to be done and specially in labouryng of londys / ffor forsooth I have herd say
by the old historyographes / that a noble old man romayne callid / Ualerius
Carninus used the life of a labourer unto an C year of his age / and all though
he were of long and of parfyte age / neuirthelesse he dwellid in opyn townys
and in villages and labored the lands Betwixt the first office given him in
rome and the sixth consulat of this Ualerius was xlvj yeris by reuolucyon of
yeris / and anon aftir that same time he was Iuged to be an old man / And by
that great age / he was named unable to have public office of rule and
governance of citees and towns or for to be a capitaigne to make werre for
the defense of the romans / But which men may vndirstonde that aftir the
nombre of yeris that auncien men ordained / which was from childehode unto the
beginning of old age / men might endure till that same nombre of auncien yeris
to have offices and dignitees in rome / ffor old age began aftir the
ordenaunce of the romans and not aftir the nombre of yeris / and forsooth the
last age of this valerius was more bettir and more blessid / by cause that it
had more auctorite and experience in the office of labourage of approwmentys of
manoirs feldes and lordships / If ye question how I preue that auctorite / by
the most high thing that old age might have his verry experience and exercise
/ Ye know it well Enough in co^sideryng what was that old man romayne Lucius
Metellus the most great bishop of rome which by his great auctorite and
wisdom defended Postumius consul of rome / that he should not goo for to make
werre in aufryk / in leuyng the sacrifises in the old law deputed and
accustumed of Mars god of bataile / whereof it fortuned that the seid Postumius
in obeyng to the auctorite of Lucius metellus the bishop left the seid
entrepris of his werre making though it had be committed to Postumyus as consul
of rome / Ye also may know how great the auctorite had be of old men by the
same that was subduyd in the noble romayne Actilius Catilinus / which was the
prince and lord of the people subdued and conquered as many men consenten and
as it apperith by all the versis of the title graued and wretyn upon his toumbe
/ This Attilius then was by right a man auctorised / that the fame and name
of all the romans consented / to write upon his tomb his title of renomme
in worship and in praysyng of his victoriouse deedys / Consider ye Scipion and
Lelius of what auctorite was Publius Crassus the most great bishop of rome /
And aftir him Marcus Lepedus which had the same dignyte / which both we have
seen of great age / What will ye that I tell you of thies iij noble romans
Paulus or of Affricanus or of ffabyus Maximus all iij old men / of whom the
auctorite was not only in spekyng and in counseillyng / But they were of so
great auctorite / that it was obeyed to that which they would have done or
sped / so that they had showed it but by signs and tokenes / Old age
honorable has in it pryncypally so great auctorite that it is of gretter power
than be all the delectacyons of young age /

But remember ye Scipion and Lelyus in all this my present book that I preyse
and magnyfye that old age / which from his beginning is ordained and arrayde
by the fondementys of adolescencye which be in diverse doctrynes of sciencys
lernyd and in excercisyng of honest occupacyons and craftys instruct and
excercised By which I show you that the silf old age is but lewd and
wretchid that defendith the auctorite of it only by wordys / and not by
virtues and sciences learned studied conquerid / and won in young age / as I seid
it ones in oon of my sentencys / to the which all the philosophers of rome
accorded / The white herys and the ryuilyng chier of the body of an old man
may not win suddenly auctorite nor worship / but the age passed / before the
old age / takith his lafte fruytes of auctorite / That is to wit / that the
virtues and the sciences of the young men resceyuen not hole worship nor full
auctorite till old age come on him / that his wittys be stablisshed by /
fforsoth there be seven thyngys perteynyng to the worship of old age / which
semytth to some men to be light and common / by cause that they belongen to all
good old men / which ben thies / The first is that it perteyneth that the
other young men all be it they be great in dignite to salewe and make reverence
in all places to the old man / men ought desire the felisihp of the old man
for to learn of him and to have his counseille / Men ought in every place to
give rowme and audye^ce to the old man in the felishipps where men treten and
comenyn of public offices upon matters for a common prouffite or a pryue / that
be syngler causes to be decysed / Men ought to rise sone anon before the old
man and bow them in obeyng him / Men ought to follow and goo honorably and
worshipfully aftir the old man favor and abide him when it nedith / Men
ought to lead and guide them honestly / and bring them again from the places
that old men have for to tarry / Men ought to demand question and enquere of
the old man cou^seill and advise upon chargeable matters and doubtouse thyngys
for to wit which be for to do and which be for to leave / And all thies
worships belongen to old men / which be full dylygently kept / emonge us
romans / and also in other citees towns and villages after that which be
right well founded and grounded in good conditions and the same custumes duly
observed

The historyes of the greekys said that the wise man Lisander of the kingdom
of lacedomonye in greece of whom I have now late made nenco^n / where he was
wont for to say that the cytee of lacedemone was the right honest toure or
dongeon or castle of old age / That is to wit / In the cite of lacedomone
old men resceyued right great worship and right great auctorite in dignite /
ffor in no place save there / men made not somuche worship to old age and was
not more honourid and worshipped / than it was in the seid cite of lacedomone
other wise named sparta / And know ye Scipion and lelius that we remember well
that out of the cytee of Athenys was come theder aged men of worship and
degree for to see games and plays / There was no man of all the cytezeyns
sittyng and stondyng in that great place that would give place and rowme to the
old men of Athenys for to set them to be hold and see the plays / Then
thies old men consyderyng that noon of cytezeins had not made them no place /
they withdrewe them a part from the Teatre callid the Tent and stages where as
there sat in a certain place ordained some men of the cytee of Lacedomone /
which were come unto Athenys as legates callid Ambassiatours / and the
historyes said that all the men of lacedomone ariseden from their sieges and
resceyued the seid old men for to set the same old men by them / And aftir
that they / which sat in the tentys had right greatly preysed and recomended
the men of lacedomone / which had yeuen place to the seid old men / And oon
of the men of lacedomone said heeryng them that were there / fforsooth said he
the men of athenys knowyn such things of reverence and / honor belongyng to
be done aftir right and gentilnes / but they will not do it / O ye men of
lacedomone I come to speak of you for I have knowyn that in your company and
feliship / and in your college be many things right noble and worthy to be
told of and putt in remembrance / But the honor and worship due and
belongyng unto old age / whereof I speak now is found pryncipally in your
feliship / for aftir that every man has more in age emongys you men of
lacedomone / he is holden and take for the pryncipalle / and the first place to
him assigned in the assembles and in places and public counseils / and yeuyth
first the sentences upon the causes questioned whereof men spekyn and come to be
counseylde upon the dygnyte / And the reverence and the religyon be so straytly
kept among the men of lacedomony / that not only the old men be set before
them which be in worship and dignite / But namely the bisshops and prestis
more aged be set before the Emperors and pryncys less aged /

Now may ye know that men of bodily delectacyons ought not to be compared
with the rewards of auctorite of worship / which is due and yelden to old
age and if some have to greatly used of this bodily delectaco^ns whereof I
complain me / It seemith me that they have not performed their age / but it
owght to be told for a mok / and for a fable / by cause that in their life
days they have made no profitable thing vaillable to endure by them / which
over much have used of thies delectacyons tomblyn and fall in their last age
/ That is to wit in old age which is to vndirstonde / not as Iouglers
mynstrels and players turnyn and tomblyn up so down in the last end of their
plays of maistryes for disport^ making by the which they ought lightly to be
excused / But the men which so long have used / of delectacyon that they leave
it but as a fable and a v^nyte / They ought to have no mercy nor be excused /
But some may tell me that old men be slow and soft / angwisshous / and heavy
/ angry and soroufulle / variant and mystrustyng / and if we seek well the
conditions of old men / we shall find as ye say / that they be also nygardes
and couetouse / But I answer you Scipion and Lelyus / that their vices which
ye name here above / be the vices of the conditions of corrupt and evil
custumes / and be not the vices aftir age / But algatis this evil slownesse of
body and the other vices that I have said which semyn to be found in old age
have apparau^ce of some excusacyon which forsooth is not Just / But it is
such that it seemyth that men may preue that it be reasonable / Men may yet
oppose me that old men trowyn and ymagyne to be dispraysed and mocked of young
men / And with that all office and every dyspleasyre be hatefulle to old age
/ by cause that old men have their bodies freel and sekely / by which they
may suffer noon offenses of displeasir nor wrethfull

But I tell you Scipion and Lelius / that though old men weenyn to be
dispraised and mocked and offended of young men which things arn diverse and
hateful to old men / Neuirtheles if they be purueid of good conditions and
virtues and of good sciences as they ought to be the thyngys aforesaid shall
seem them sweet and light to bear and to suffer / ffor though the mind be
purueid of good conditions and virtues and of good sciences / it may not be so
hard offended nor troubled / but it appeaseth and swetith it holdyng him
content and pleased / as soon as it thenkith and remembrith the propre goodness
that it has in it silf / But and the old men be not well drawyn forth in
connyng and manerly taught and wise / the evil conditions hereaboue reherced
should be to them hard noyous and hateful / and parauenture importable and it
is not merueil though some old men suffryn and heeryn well and softly the
greuaunces of old age / And that some arn inportune and weary of age / ffor we
may read and see like thing in the living and the condico^ns of two brethren
gemellys callid twynlynges / whereof the poet Trecencius made a comodye callid
aelphis / the which he read in the scene at rome / ffor of thies two brethren
gendird of oon ffadir in oon belly at onys norisshed / the oon like as the other
/ the one was hard sharp angry ungracious and rude / And the other was curteys
meke honest and debonaire /

Than know ye Scipion and lelius that such is the ordenaunce of the custumes
of old age / ffor as every wine long kept and old waxith not eagre of his
own propre nature / right so all mankind is not aygre fell cruel ungracious
chargyng nor inportune in old age of their own kind / though some men among
many be found of that condico^n / I approve and preyse in old age the man
which has seueritee and stidfast abydyng in him / seuerite is contynuance and
perseverance of oon manner of living aswele in the thyngys within as in them
without / But I approve not that in an old man be egrenesse nor hardness and
sharpness of manners of conditions / and also I may not consceyue nor
vndirstonde why auaryce and couetyse ought to be in an old man / for there is
no thing more unreasonable nor more folyssh / then is for to hepe gretter
quantite of wordily goods or of vitailles in the time when the man has less
wey for to endure and and live / Now it is so that old age aftir nature is
the end of the last days of old men / wherefore aftir reason they ought less
put them to thought solicitude and care for to gadre more great hepes and
plente of richesses and tresours then nedith /

Here endith the fourth part and the third distincto^n of this book and aftir
begins the fyfthe part and the fourth and the last distinction by the
which Caton confoundith and repreuith the fourth vituperacyon opposid against
old age / beginning / Quarta restat /etc.
bY cause that in the iijj distincto^n next of this book I have sufficiently
answered to the third opposico^n / that young age opposith against old age so
behooves now to say the fourth cause answeryng to the fourth vituperacyon of
old age reprouyng / which semith pryncypally to constrayne and forthenk our
old age / and this fourth vytuperaco^n is by cause that young age lothith /
esche with / and says against old age by cause that it nygheth the death /
which aftir course of nature may not be ferr from old age / But oon defaute
Scipion and Lelius consider ye I pray you how the old man is a keitif
wretchid and unhappy which that sees not ne vndersto^dith that in old age men
ought not to rek nor set by neithir to be afferd of death whethir it neyheth or
comes / ffor men ought not plainly to retche not of death / but ought to defy
it / if it quench and bring to naught the soul / as falsely says and is the
opinion of the philosopher Epicurus / Orels men ought namely to desire the death
if it led and bring our soulys in some place for to be perdurable aftir the
departing of the body / as truly seith Aristotle prince of philosophers and
also they that folowyn him / And it is true that betwixt thise two means is
founden no third / ffor it must nedys be that the soul be deed or stynt and
end with the body / orels that aftir the death of the body it lyuith euir /
Then I / that am an old man have no cause for to doubt the death if I shall
not be wretchid nor unhappy / aftir the death by cause that my soul dies with
my body as some affermyn falsely / Orellys I have no cause for to doubt the
death / if aftir that I shall be blessid and ioyouse euirlastyng / by cause yt my
soul nedith not nor is ded for euir aftir this present death And though ye
oppose against old age that it be nygh the death / Tell me what man is so great
afole / how be it that he adolescent or young of age that knowith of troth and
in certain / that he shall live tyl^ eve / and for to excuse moreouir the iiij
repreef and defaute alleged / I tell you Scipion and lelius that young age
enclyned to excess and to outrageousnesse has mo causes of death / than our
old age / ffor young men more lightly fallen in sekenessis / they be more
grievously seek / they take health more latter and with gretter daungier / And
for this reason few men may come to old age / And if the age of yongth would
leave the excess / and the great outragyousnes of surfetes / and would follow
the temperaunce of old age / the young men should live better and more wisely /
ffor in old men is grounded with sad purpos aduis reason and cou^seil / And it
is certain that if there had neuir be noon old men / there had neuir be no
cytees towns ne villages edified nor no comynaltees of men living / rulid and
governed to the common well aftir Justice / And by cause that I have seid
shortly that young age fallith more lightly in sekenes and in parel of death /
than does old age / which has be cause of a disposico^n for to edifye cytees
and towns / and Justly to make and ordeyne assemblees of men / and people to
govern citees and townys and countries / I begin now and torn again how
young age opposith that the death is the neyghbore of old age / And for to tell
the troth there is no shame nor repreef to old age by cause that they be nygh
to death / ffor ye see that if the death were Just cause of blame and of repreef
/ that cause should be commune to the age of adolescence and also to old age /
And as ye well know I had a right good sone named Caton as I am / And thou
Scipion also haddist two brethren young men / which aftir their evident merits
should / have be in right great dignite preferrid / That is to wit consuls of
rome / as many oon trustid and hoped / which three decessed in their young age /
where by I have vndirstonde and perceived verily / that death is common to all
ages / But ye may say that the man adolescent and young hopith that he shall
live long / and aftir that a man is old he may not have such an hope /
Therefore I answer you that the young man hopith foliously / if by cause of his
young age he wenith to live long / ffor he is not certain thereof nor knowith not
the truth / Now there is nothing more folly then is for to have and hold the
doubtuose thyngys as certain / and the false as true / and if ye oppose against
old age that the old man has nothing in him whereby he may hope to live more
/ I answer you Scipion and Lelius that by this thing is bettir the condition
and the astate of the old man than of the young man / ffor the young man will
live long / and the old man has lived long / how be it that in the life of
the man is nothing long by the ordenau^ce of the goddys which to mankind have
set necessite and need for to dye / I will Scipion in considering hou old men
lyuen that thou telltst me hou it is true that every man have some last time
assigned / Consider we Architonius king of Tarse which is the pryncipalle
country of cilice / This Architonius as I have seen written in historyes reigned
four and twynty year And lived six score yeris / But know ye Scipion and
Lelyus that forsooth there is no thing that semith to me long / since it has some
last end ffor whenne that last end comyth / the time and yeris of great
peynes and labors / in yongth in great auentures which before be passed is
then eskaped and run all to geder / And than abides only in the
remembrance and mind the merit / which thou have conquerid by thy virtue and
by thy good werkys done in time passid / which ought make the glad which
haste ouir skaped all the Ieopardyes and auenturis as well in bataile as in
diverse and many other weyes perylouse aswele on the sea as on the land / The
hours of the time of our life / and the days / and the monethys and also the
yeris passen and come neuir again / And also the thing to come may not be known
/ by no man nor in what place and in what astate he be aftir the death / Every
man ought to be content and pleasid of such hope of time / as god had yeuen
him for to live / And for to show how and why the man ought to live / I would
that ye know that as the poet makith not only by versys of a fable in his
comedye callid an interlude to thentente by cause that it please to him that
pleyeth it in the game / But the poet makith only his comedye and / interlude
to the end by cause that in every pagent he be preysed and commended of every
man aftir his play / And the wise man also ought not to desire to live / tylle
that he say / That is to wit / I will no longer of my life / ffor a short and
a little time of age is long for to live well and honestly / And if it fortune
that thou live but a short and little time / thou owhtyst not to have any more
forthynkyng nor sorrow than have the laborers of the lands / which have no
forthenkyng nor sorrow / by cause that the swetnesse and softnes of prymetemps
callid veer and spryngyng time be passed / And that the time of somer and of
autompne callid heruest be common / ffor though the labourer see and smelle
gladly the odoures of fresshe flowers and herbs in prymetemps nevertheless / he
is glad for the time of somyr in which ripyn the herbys trees and fruytes of
therthe / And for the time of autompne and heruest in which he gaderith them
to gedir he putted them in the berne and in the garnere / Now ought ye to know
that the perymetemps signifies the age of adolescencye or of yongth which
shewith by signs of prymetemps bourionyng and spryngyng what fruit shall
turn and do to the man in his time to come / And the two other seasons / that
is to wit somer and heruest be profitable and able for to repen mow shere
and gadre the fruytes to geder to the use of men / And also it is true as I
have beforesayde that the fruit of old age signifies the mind and
remembrance and the habondaunce of the goodys / which before have be made ready
and conquerid by virtue of good werkys / and for to preue more ouir that for to
dye in old age / is noon harm nor repreef / I tell you Scipion and Lelius that
all things that be made aftir nature ought not to be accounted nor rekened
among the goodys of the man / Now it is so that there is no thing that is so
much according aftir nature as is / that aswele men as other things growyng
by kind dyen in the time of their old age / and yet it is certain that death
comith to young men and adolescentys / which is against kind and out of nature
/ where by the death is to them more peynefull soroufull and hard / And by that
the adolescentes and young men as me semyth dyen like as old men / which
quenches a strong and a right great fflame of fire / by castyng in of much
watir / and old men dyen as a fire which stynteth and wastes it self / or as
a candel / and the match in a lamp of oil consumith without doing violence
and without any force and strength / I make eft sonys anothir co^mparison of
death / which comyth both to young and old men ffor as the appils and other
fruytes hangyng on the trees be by force plucked in the mean time whiles they
be raw and new and when they be ripe and melowe by the heete of the son
they fallen of with their free and plain will / and so the death takith awey by
her violente force the life of young men / and the ripnesse of old age takith
awey the life of old men softely and without force / And this death which
comith by ripnesse of long age is so joyful and so agreeable to me in so much
as I shall apply and come more nygh to it in a convenient season / The death is
also to me noon other wise joyful or agreeable / than should be to me the deye
land / if me thought that I should see it when I seyle in a ship or swymme in
the sea to the port or hauyn / And that it were likly that I should come to the
port or hauyn aftir that I have seyled and vyaged long upon the sea / That is
to wit that death / which comith to the wise man aftir long age / is like the
port or h^auen that men see from ferr in seylyng upon the sea which does
great joy when men be upon the river in to the haven ward and to have takyn
their port salve / ffor the dread of the parelles and dangers of rokkes
sandys and great tempestys be than passid chaungid and turned in saftee and
rest / How be it that the five first ages have their end and their term /
aftir certain nombre of yeris / Nevertheless old age which is the last has
no certain term / And yet thou may rightly live in old age in the mean
time / and as long as thou may perform and defend the werkys of life / and
the offices in which thou art yeuen unto / So alwey that thou doubt not death
though thou live long / whereby it fortuneth that namely old age is more
couragyouse and more hard and vigorouse ageyn all feerys and dredys / than is
adolescencye which doubtith and dredith death / This thing is preuid by the
sentence that the right wise philosopher Solon answered to a tirant callid
Phisistratus which Phisistratus by violence occupied the lordship of Athenys /
ffor where as the seid tiraunt demau^did of Solon in what thing / he
pryncipally trusted / and why that he resisted him so boldily / Men seyen that
it is true / that the seid Solon answered that he trusted in his old age / by
the boldenes of which he despised death / and doubtid noon other thing / But I
will not blame lightly them which desiren to lyuen / ffor the end of living
is right good whilom that man has hole thenkyng of vndirstondyng and hole
reason and naturell wit / certain and stable for to labor in office
perteynyng to life of man / Dame Nature which has assembled and encreced in
mankind a body to wyrke / That is to wit / the thynkyng and the reasons and
the wittys for to do and exercise the offices of the life / she brekyth
hirself and brings to naught high courage at the last end of age / when
nature is consumed / So as it is in the werkys of nature / in like wise it is
in the werkys of craftys / ffor the werkeman which has made a ship or any
other edifyce in byldyng / the same werkeman kan break it right lightly / when
it is old and consumed / Now it is true that the tymbre and the matier and
the bourdys new fastened or glued be lightly disseuerd / and tho which have
be glued and fastened long time paste / be brokyn with great peynes / So then
Scipion and Lelyus may know that old men ought not couetously desire that
short space of life / which yet abides with them / and also they ought not to
leave it without Just and honest cause / whereby the cause to hurt himself or
short his life which by all naturell kind and by all dyuyne reason is
forbeden to every man / since that he may not do that / which has noon honest
occasion / And the philosopher Pytagoras which forbedith that without the
commandment of god / no man depart from the bodily life / he uses and
makith his reason by such likeness and similytude as of a prince of the land
which makes the constable of a battle which the prince signifies / whe^ne
he ordeyneth his souldours to abide and stand in some place assigned / ffor he
commaundith them that for nothing they stere not ne remeuen without his
commandment Pitagoras by this exsample would say / that without the
commandment of god no man should purchase his death / And if thou oppose and
seyest against that which I have said / That is to wit that the old man ought
not to desire to live the remenaunt of his time / ffor as thou say / the
philosopher Solon than old / by express wordys ordained that his frendys
should make sorrow wepyngys and lamentacyons aftir his death / I tell the Scipion
that the wise Solon would be lamented and bemeaned of his frendys by cause that
they should show that he had loved them / and that they were euir in his love /
But I wot neuir Caton if the poet Ennyus would be holden more dear and
soroufull of his frendys by cause that aftir his death he would not be bywailled
nor lamented / ffor by his verses he seid / that aftir his death noon of his
frendys should not desire him again in weeping / and that in his service of
exequyes funeral noon should weep for him / I answer the Scipion that Ennyus
vndirstode hoely that men should not weep for the death of him / nor of any other
that becomith vndedely and immortalle / aftir this present death which comith to
them which have lived all their life aftir all virtues / Thou tellist me again
Scipion / that old men felyn in them some dread of the death / which dread
lastith by a little while specially in the old man which dies soon and
softly with little pain / Therefore I tell the Scipion that the feelyng and
vndirstondnyg of that dredefulnesse is such that it ought to be desired ffor
aftir death it is naught / And by cause that the soul departed with the body
the which I mean not othirwise / but what thing euir it be of the feelyng of
the deed of death / we ought to have stable thenkyng from our adolescence / for
to live in such wise and so well that we may despise does withouten having of
it any dread or grudchyng / without this thynkyng no man may live in peasible
courage / for euir / the dread of death flees before the eyes of the thought /
I tell you forsooth / that it must nedys be certain that no old man may deye
young / And it is uncertain a thing to know if that a man shall dye in this
present day / There is no man then which may live in suertee of courage of a
mighty heart / if he doubt the death which may come and stele upon him at all
hours of the day or he beware /

It is no need that I dispute long with you of death / for to show you that men
ought not to doubt it / ffor if I bring to mind the wise and the couragiouse
men of all astates and aged men / which doubted not to suffer death for Just
and honest things / I may tell you thereof many exsamples though it need not /
ye know by historyes / how aftir that Tarquyne the proud king of rome was
banysshed / and driven away and depryued of the royame for the foul mysdeede
that the sone of the seid Tarquyne did / in defoulyng by violence the right
chaste lady of great worship and renomme Lucresse wif of the noble Collatyn
Citezeyn of Rome / The duke Tarquyn had a sone callid Arnus which by arms
enforced him to recouir the seid reame and to take awey the libertee and
freedom of the people / and to bring it again in seruage / But Lucyus Brutus
then consul of rome as he which doubted not death and which for the common
welfare of the cite and for the freedom of rome to be had / he would of plain
and full will lose this present life / being with the host and bataile of the
romans lighted upon his horse and leyde his spear in the arrest and sporrid
his horse against the seid Appius thorugh his hooste between two batailles and in
such wise encountered and coped the one with the other / that both two were
wounded and hurted with dedly woundys fille deed upon the earth / and so by the
couragyous heart and manhood to ouircome that great enemy to Rome by the
voluntary death of the seid chiuallerous noble Brutus / remained stille and
abode to the people of Rome their right precious tresour / That is to wit
their freedom and their franchises which were before time appopred unto them /
ffor to show also that men owght not to dread death / it nedith not that I
tell the historye of this noble romayne Publyus Decyus / nor of his sone in
like wise named Studecyus amongys them of his kynrede / he was the first which
had the dignyte of consulat at Rome / and how he being consul was onys in
battle with the Romans / And he saw that his host was nygh all putt down
/ or should have been destroyed and ouircome / he of his plain will and great
manhood ordained in his courage and in his thought that he should give and
abandone his body / for the salvation of the common prouffite of Rome / Then
he mowntyng upon his courser and his spear in his arreste spurrid his horse
which bare him swyftly in to the myddys of the host of his enemies / That
noble and worthy Decyus which would the health and welfare of his country and
the death of him self to take / before his death made great ^^ision upon his
enemies of Rome / And aftir that by speres wounded fille deed to the earth /
and so through his entreprice and courage / by the blood that Decyus shedd it
fortuned to the hooste of the Romans / the victory against their trust and
hope was had / ffor when they saw their worthy prince and consul and chief of
the field deed / by his own high courage and freewill and for the salvation of
all his feliship and country / The seid Romans took so great courage against
their enemies / And ensured themsilf to live or deye in mortal bataille /
with their prince and the field / whereof they had the victory / The sone of
the seid Publius being four times consul of rome had so great and so mighty
courage and thought as his ffader in following his nobles in arms and chiualrye
/ ffor his seid sone Publius of his plain and freewill of a mighty courage in
marcyal causis auauncyng hymsilf upon his enemies in bataile in defendyng the
noble romans he abandoned his body and his owen propre life for the salvation
of the common prouffite of the romans / And this is a noble exsample / that so
ought such chiualerouse knyghtys put them in adventure for their prince and for
the defense and saufgarde of a reame or country being in seruage / ffor to
show also that men ought not to doubt the death nor dread to depart out of
this present life / It is no need that I tell you of one of the most noble
pryncys of good remembrance Marcus Attilius first a labourer of the lands /
and aftir elect consul and connestable of the batails of rome / which by many
a time ouircame and had the vppirhande and victory of the men of cartage
mortal enemies to the Romans / and at last the noble prince by chau^gyng
of fortune was takyn prisoner in to Cartage / And for the delyuerance of the
same Marcus Attilyus out of prisone / then an old man / the lordys and
gouerners by cause they vndirstode his great manhood as a victoriouse prince
against them / and how he was worthy in renomme and to be worshippid for his
manhood / and how also he was of so great age / that he aftir tho days should
be of easy power of bodily strength to make any more werre against Cartage /
treted him and desired / that he should for his deliuerau^ce out of prison /
make to be redeemed / delyuerd and recouerd many of their young lords knyghtys
and Gentiles of Cartage takyn prisoners before time amongys the Romans / And
in trust thereof the seid Marcus Attilius was fraunchysed out of their
Captivity and so relessed upon his faith promised that he should return / He
at a certain day to come again to prison in to cartage in case that he could
not procure and provide for the delyuerau^ce of the seid young men lordys
knyghtis and gentiles of Cartage so prisoners then in rome / Attilius willing
to despise the death and for an honest cause of an vnyuersale well of his
cou^treye / would spend both his body and his life / consyderyng that the
common prouffite of rome might be hynderd and damaged greatly / if for that his
deliuerau^ce out of prison should cause the seid young knyghtys of cartage were
yolden and deliuerd again home to their country / cou^seillid and willid
against him self to his destruction and seide to the senators of rome and also
to his and wife childeren that he would yield him self raithir again to prison
to Cartage / though he might othirwise be relessed / and also would acquyte him
Justly of his oath and promise to his master captaigne made / And though he
knew the outragiouse cruelte and great duresse of enprisonement of the men of
Cartage then his enemies which when he returned freely in to prison
constreyned him by great duresse and pain turmented him in a pype / festned
and stikked fulle of nailles rollid him and kutte the ledys of his eyes that he
might not sleep / and other pains for to dye by so long and cruel turment and
pain that it is not possible to rehearse it without weeping terys / There is no
need also to rehearse how that Scipion Affrycan and Scipion Asian two brethern
right noble and gloriouse champions / for the common prouffite employed and
occupied all their strengthis and their bodies / and in diverse batailles
auenturid them against them of auffryk / ffor aftir the death and discomfityng of
the great Pompee / Scipion othirwise callid Affrican succedid in office aftir
the seid Pompee and was in one of the batailes of Rome that discomfited by
arms the men of auffryk / aftir Cartage destroyed by the great Scipion And
brought them to the lordship of Rome / But where as by chaungyng of fortune
Scipion hoped no refuge ne socour / he departed from auffryk for to come in to
spain by nauye of shippis with some Captaignes of Rome aftir many turmentys in
the sea / he and his nauye by sodeyn tempestys of wyndes / were d^yuen and came
again in to the country of Affryk / And there he was besegyd by Publyus Sticyus
knight of Julius Caesar which then allone occupied the lordship of Rome /
Scipion then would rathir deye in thestate of his freedom and libertee and
for to escape the servitude of Caesar as he that charged not in setting no price
of his death killed / him self with his own propre hand / All be it that he
might escape lightly ynowgh that mysfortune / ffor Caesar would have been to him
full gracious and debonaire ynowgh / and aftir that his right noble brothir
Scipion Asianus / which by bataile subdued and putt down the countrees and
the kings and the people of the parties of asie / he made fulle rich
encreacyng and multeplyeng the common Tresour of Rome / as he which has many
Tryumphes and victoryes and which conquered many kings and pryncis by victory
in batailes / And aftir that he returned again to Rome where he was unjustly
accused by the excitacion and exhortyng of king Anchiochus / which by falls
accusacions and conspiracyes made him to be unjustly accused and sklaundred /
and surmytted upon him forged matters / how that he had takyn to his own
singular avail and prouffite and witholden to him self great nombre and
quantite of money and Tresour which should have be putt in to the common
tresour / whereupon the seid Scipion was takyn and bound with yrons and was
putt in derck prison wherein he ended his days without any vnpacience / I
rehearse not also only of thy Grau^tsire Lucius paulus consul romayne / which
dreded not the death / but would leave his bodily life of his own good will

ffor where as Hanybal duke of Cartage Enemy to our cytee of Rome had
assembled his hooste in a town of poyle callid Cannes / And for to resist him
and withstand / had there coming the seid Paulus thy Grauntsyre and anothir
consul his fellow with all the strength of Rome / three hunderd noble young
knyghtys romans with a part of the host without the cou^seile and
co^sentyng of the seid Paulus assembled to gedir and joined in bataile / In the
which that part of the seid host and the consul and the seid three hundred
knyghtys were ouirthrowe and died shamefully / That is to wit by defaute of
good ordenau^ce and out of array being / they lost the victory and were
disconfited And where thy seid grau^tsire Paulus saw his fellow and his host
so ouirthrowe discomfited and killed / he with the reemnant of his hooste
auaunced him in to the bataile without any hope or victory / but only to
thentente that he would venge the outragiouse discomfiture and ouirthrowe of
his fellow consul / which foliously vndirtoke the deed of entrepryse / in
semblable wise was by mortel fate ouirthrowe and slain emongys his Enemies /
It is no need that I tell how Marcus Marcellus consul Romayne despised not his
death in plain bataile as a chiualrouse knight / ffor without any great auis /
he with an egre heart desyryng to resist against the affricans and the men of
Affrike / was chosen and required for to fight with Hanyballe chief prince of
Cartage in the feelde / wherein our soldiers Romans assembled gladly and
right well chered and stable in their noble courage / And yet they thought well
enough that without coming again of the seid Marcellus her chyueteyne they
should dye / as it happith them so to do / ffor the seid Marcellus would not
spare his life for the worship of Rome / auaunced him self against Hanyball and
was slain in plain feelde in the first bataile or he might releue and socoure
his host / And they all with marcellus consul and chief cheueteyne of that
bataile dyed in the field in the defense of the Romans fulle nobly
worshippfully to their great renomme / aftir which their enemies of Cartage
made great sorrow of their death for their great manhood they did them great
reverence at their beryenges / As I have said in my book of the birth of the
noble ytalyens / The which Marcellus so consul lyeng deed in the feelde with
his knyghtys / the seid Hanibal most cruel enemy of the Romans / made him to
be brought to earth with great worship of sepulture / ffor hanybal aftir his
own propre noblesse / co^sideryng the virtue of the seid Marcellus and
couragiouse heart bare him so vigorously as a lion in bataile which in no wise
doubted the death in exposyng and auauncyng his body and his life for the
public and common prouffite and saluaco^n in defending the Romans / he did
cover the body of the seid Marcellus with a pall of rich cloth of gold /
aftir their rightes custume and usage of marcialle men of auffrike / and yafe
him a coro^ne of lauror / and aftir brent him in a solemn fire aftir the
manner of old auncyen men of worship to be preserved and kept amongys the
noble men of worship / What Scipion and Lelyus will ye that I tell you since
the young and adolescent men / And not only they that be introducted and
enfourmed in sciences and virtue / living aftir the condition of a philosopher
/ but namely the foolys and ydiotes lothen not nor doubten the death as ye have
herd me and declare in the precedent exsamples / Thenk ye then / that the
wise old men ought not to be aferde by cause they be nygh the time of their
death And he that is full and replete of all the studyes and werkys perteynent
to every age / he is replete and weary of the time of this life / so that he
doubt not in no wise the death as it seemyth me rightfully and as I preue it by
my self / And note ye for a good advertisement to every man for to bear in
remembrance and for his prouffite / That certain thyngys be wherein pueryce
callid childhode / which is the second age puttith his study and his
entendyng in things according to his agreement / And the adolescente men which
be under the third age desyren in no wise the things and the besynes / wherein
puerice studyeth and occupyeth / And certain things be wherein the men studyen
and occupyen them in beginning of their adolescencye / Also certain things be
/ in which young age / which is the fourth and the mean age / puttith not his
study and business in his precedent ages / though the man had employed and
occupied him in the other first ages which be smaller and of less degree /
Young age is callid the age stable and mean / by cause that it holdith the
mean betwixt adolescence and old age And cesseth than the man for to do lighe
things and folyes / And as then or neuir the man is stable and hole in body
in wit and vndirsto^ding / The things and the werkys in which young men
studyen And occupye them been such / that old men rek neuir of it / But
namely old age has delectacyon in some things in his last days wheryn he
studyeth and employeth his wittys / How be it then that the studyes and the
werkys of the five first ages dyen and seace in some time and seasons / they in
such wise seacen and dyen in the business studyes and the werkys of old age
which when they lacken in the man / than he which is full and weary for to
live in this world / comes to that time which is ripe and couenable for to
dye / fforsoth I see nothing but I dare tell you that which I feel and
perceive of the death / ffor me seemyth that I may better see and feel the
nature and the proprete of death / by as much as I which am an old man am less
ferr from it / fforsoth Scipion and Lelius I deem and think in my courage that
in the high heuyn leuyn your two ffadirs / which have be rightfully named and
noble in worship / and my right dear frendys / also I deem in my thought that
your two ffadirs lyuen of oon life / as of oon good disposicion / which only
and noon other owght to be callid a life / ffor whiles we be enclosed within
thies joints of our materiel body / we use of an office conteynyng necessite
for to dye / And al so we use of a gracious work and heavy by cause that the
body draws to the death ward / But within us / is a celestial soul and
dyuyne fourmed / which from the most high paleis is come down to be Joined
and knytt with mankind bodily / and if it had be converted and hid within
the earth out of his naturelle place appropred / The place wheryn the
celestial soul remains to quykyn the body for a season / is contrary to the
dyuyne nature of the soul which is resemleled and likend to the Trynyte /
ffor the soul is celestial and descended from an high place / And the body is
erthly low and puissau^t The soul is vndedly and the body is dedly / But I
believe that the vndedly goddys have spread and sown the souls within the
bodies of mankind to thentente / that the men should see and inhabit the
countrees / And by cause also that the men consyderyng the ordenaunces of the
celestial thing should follow that ordenaunce by manner of stablenesse of life /
That is to wit that god which is vndedly has putt and puts the vndedly
souls within the bodies of the dedly men to thentente that they perceive and
inhabyte within this low world to such an end that they consydere the
ordenaunce of heaven / and that they may live aftir stable life / celestial and
perdurable with god And know ye Scipion and Lelyus that my reason nor my
dysputacyon / which I have made upon this matter / constreyned me neuir that I
should believe that the souls of men should be mortal and dedly / as to deye
with the body / But namely thordenau^ce and thauctorite of the sovereign
philosophers has constreyned me to believe that when I herd disputaco^ns
amongys the wise philosophers of the study of Rome / redyng the doctrines of
the worthy philosopher Pytagoras and the oppynyons of them that followed him
which the most part of them / they have be by old times passid callid latyns
philosophers / Thy determined for troth that we have the souls spread and /
sown within our bodies / the which were not gendred simplye by nature / but
that they were of a godly and a dyuyne substance such as god ordained it in
his thought / wheryn is the figure and the mirror of all things both godly
and manly / according with the doctrine of Pytagoras and with thoppinions of
his disciples / Men did enfourme and teache me the doctrine / and that the
philosophre socrates in the last day of his life had concluded and affermed /
And they spekyn of the Inmortalite and vndedlynes of the souls / This Socrates
whylom master of the philosophre Platon / was holden the most wise of all the
other philosophers as it appeared and was showed by the answer of the god
appollo to whom men demanded / which was the most wise of the auncyen
philosophers / Socrates said / he ought to have the pryncipal honor and
renomme among all the wise men of the cite of Athenys / It nedith not also that
I speak euir of the vndedlynesse of the souls / but I hold trustely that the
souls of men be vndedly ffor since the lightness of the souls is so great that
they be euir meuyng / since the mind of things passed is so great and parfite
in the souls that men remembryn of tho things which be passid like as that
they were present And since the dyuyne providence of things for to come is so
great and fervent in the souls / that the man counseillith him pourueieth him
and auiseth him of some thing meritable and profitable and also comfortable
to come / And since that in the souls ben so many connynges crafts and subtle
conceytes for to make aftir right naturelle reason / the werkys connyngys and
crafts / wheryn the men workyn and occupyen them commonly to live by And where
as in the souls be so great sciences and wittys both godly and manly and so
many new conceytes and diverse things found without any exsample or patron /

I say aftir my wit and feelyng that the soul which naturelly conteyneth the
things that I have here above said / may not be dedly / I show you and preue
other wise that the soul is vndedly / ffor since the soul euir has in hit
diverse meuyngys / by cause that one time it coueiteth the delectable things /
as is science / craft / prudence / sapience / wisdom / wit / vndirstondyng
and other good spirituel virtues and such things which seem to be good /

And anothir time the soul has meuyng of contrary passions as in waxyng wroth
/ thoughtfull heavy / dredefulle noyouse sekely / ffor displesant thyngis /
which be or semen to be evil / and hynderyng to the body It must nedys
conclude / that it be perpetuell and euirlastyng / I preue you also / that the
soul is vndedly / ffor it has nothing that sterith it for to do that which
it does / ffor the soul meuith and sterith it self / and the soul shall
neuir have the end of his meuyng / ffor the soul may neuir leave it self /
ffor it would euir be for to do some office perteynyng to his kind and to his
nature And by anothir reason I preue that the soul is perdurable and
euirlastyng / ffor the naturell substance of the soul is simple and is not
composed nor commixted of parties of diverse natures / And also there is nothing
in the soul / which is meddled with unlike to his naturelle substance /
whereby it must nedys be said / that the soul may not be dyuided in diverse /
partys / And if it so be men must nedys conclude that it may not dye / And more
ouir to preue that the soul be perdurable / ye have a great argument and good
approbacyon by cause that the men knowyn many and diverse things or they be in
puerice / ffor as ye know men in the age of puerice / when they learn and
studyen in the speculatyf sciencys and craftys of the practike and of subtyle
and dyuyne conceytes vsyng aftir the craft called experyence / which be full
hard daungerouse and subtle to come unto / they witholden and conceyuen so
hastily and so soon diverse conceytes and many oppynyons arguen that it seemyth
not only that they lernyn them newly and soon / but it seemyth that eftsonys
they have thereof mind and remembrance as if they had knowyn them before And
know ye that the philosopher Platon is the auctor which spoke of the soul so
as I have here said / Aftir that I have showed you by argumentys and reasons
that the souls be not dedly / I now will by exsample and by auctorite show
that the souls arn perpetuel and euirlastyng / The philosopher Exenophou
witnessith in a book of his callid Economus that the great Cyrus king of perse
/ the day that he dyed said to his childeren the wordys that folowyn / My right
dear childeren said the king / thenk ye not but that I euir am in some place /
and also but that I be some thing being aftir that I shall be departed from
your feliship / ffor when I was with you / ye might not see my soul by which
I am vndedly / but ye shall perceive well enough / that in my body was my soul
conjoined by the seven werkys which I excercised in my life / ffor my body was
by the mean of my soul / I hadd free will / and not will for to do or not
to do / all possible thyngys / I had right demyng of things true and false /
I had feelyng of the qualitees of the things / I respired by brethyng
resceyuyng in and owte by the conduytys of my body / I knew and discerned the
things by their propre causes /

I had mind and remembrance of things before passed / Aftir thies seven
werkys the soul is named by seven names / That is to wit / Soul / Courage /
Reason ffeelyng / Thought / Mind / and Spirit / Ye ought then to believe /
that aftir my departing / the soul of me is such as it is now / though ye see
that my body be brought to naught / Yet by cause the worshipps the dignytees
and the good werkys of noble and famous men should not be extyncte and not
remembrid / Honor should be showed and done unto them which passyn out of
this world / aftir their death / But their souls should do so much / that we
should have of their goodness lawde and praysyng memoyre and mind longer than
the time of their life Know ye seid also the king Cirus that neuir man could
make me to consent nor to grant that the souls should live whiles they be
within the dedly bodies / nor that they should dye aftir that they be disseuerd
and departed from the bodies / And also say I / that neuir man could make me to
grant nor to consent / but the soul be wise and nobly endowed aftir that it
is disseuerd from the body folissh and foul / But I consent and grant that
the soul begins to be wise aftir that it is disseuerd and clean and hole of
all the medelyng of the body / which is meddled and commixted of four
elementys / which arn emongys themsilf contrary / And since the naturelle body
of the man / which is the most noble of the things comes again to naught by
the death / It is clear and notoire in what place all the other thyngys goen /
ffor the thyngys of this world goon again to that / from whens they came / The
soul of man shewith not nor appears not / nor it may not be seen / Neithir
when it is conjoined with the body nor when it is disseuerd from hit / Ye see
al so said king Cirus / that there is nothing so like the death as is the sleep /
And certain it is that the souls of them which slepyn shown and declare the
dyuynyte and godliness of the soul / ffor many men slepyng / perceyuen and
knowyn by their sleep / things for to come / So that the men be delyuerd and
franchised / of erthly thoughtys whereby men ought to vndirsto^de what shall be
our souls when they be clean relessed of the bonds of erthly bodies

ffor the souls without comparyson shall use more plainly of their dyuynyte
and godliness aftir that they be out of the prison and of the bondys of the
body

Wherefore if thies things be true / that is to wit / that my soul is vndedly
and inmortal as I have said / I will ye my right dear childeren that ye
worship me in god / But if it so be that my soul should dye with my body to
gedir neuirthles / we which bear reverence to the goddys / which defendyn and
govern all the beauty and fairness that is in the feliship of the body and of
the soul / I will that all regiously and withoutyn brekyng ye keep the mind
of me specially / by well saying and by well doing as I have done whiles I
lived This great Cirus king of Perse said all thies wordys to his right dear
childeren at the hour that he dyed But and it please you Scipion and Lelius
See we what be our opinions in the manner of the inmortalite and vndedlynes of
man's soul / And know ye Scipion that there is no man that makith me to
consent nor to accord that thy ffadre Paulus with thy two Grauntsirs Polus
and Scipion thaffrikan / or the ffadre of the uncle of the seid affrycan or
many other worthy and noble men romans / which it nodith not to name nor to
tell / would have enforced them / for to do the great dedys of virtues and of
worthynesses for to have of it the mind name and fame amongys the men / that
aftir them shall come / But they had auised and knowyn in their courage that tho
that by succession of lygne shull come aftir them should have in their courage
such virtues and good deedys that aftir their death the remembrance of it
should endure /

Thenkist thou than Scipion that I had vndirtaken and sustained so great
labors both by night and by day all the time of my life / aswele as for the
government of our cytee of rome / as of mine own propre household / and also
in actys and deedys of armies / if I had thought that by like semblable terms I
should end with the life of my body The glory / the lawde and preysing and
the name of the renomme and fame that I may have deseruid and conquered by my
labors before said / I speak thus Scipion with the to thentente that I have a
singular Joy and deserve lawde aftir the manner of old men / which in tellyng
and geuyng enformacnon of their good deedys / gloryfye them and praysen / And
by that they yeuen courage as an evident exsample to young men for to do like
semblable good deedys / if I owght then oon time end my life / and the mind
of my worshippfull acts and dedys of renomme / and if it so were that my soul
should dye with my body / it had be bettir to me / that I had lyuyd ydylly and
in rest than to labor / and without bataile making / But that I had seen
and thought certainly in my courage that tho which by succession of lygnee
should come aftir me / would have in their courage my labors and my good
deedys putt in remembrance / And that aftir my death / the glory and renomme
of it should abide to the men which be for to come and the reward to be youen
by the souereyns of dyuyne governance to the vndedly goddys / But yet ye
Scipion and Lelyus may seye to me / how mankind rising and liftyng up to get
glory / euir lokith before him for to deserve remembrance unto them which
aftir him shall come / Therefore I answer you that it is said to thentente that
when the soul shall light and depart from this present life / it may finally
live by euirlastyng life in eternalle Joy and glory / And but it were so that
the souls should live by perdurable glory and joy euirlastyng aftir this
present life / the courage of every right good man would not enforce them so
greatly to get the joy that should endure but for a season / I ask you Scipion
and Lelius what ye thenke of thies two diverse things / That is to wit / every
man like wise and virtuous dies in right pacient courage and gladness and every
man that is of folyssh and vicious disposicion / dies in courage right
impatient and dredefull / Thenk ye so / but the courage of the holy man and
good / which considerith and perceyueth more / and more far / sees right
well / and knowith that the soul goes in to a better place / and where it
shall be better than it was in this present life / and therefore the wise good man
dies in right good pacient courage / and glad to depart / But the folisshe
and delicious man / which for his ignorance and by the weight of his vicys
has the light and clernesse feeble and inclyned / so that he may not see nor
know that his soul goes in no bettyr place / nor for to be better than it
was in this present life / And forsooth by cause that I am an old man and nygh
my death / and also I thenk that my soul is inmortelle / I am right ioyfulle /
for to desire / which I have for to see your ffadirs there decessid / with
whom I have be conuersaunt haunted and also I specially loved them for their
great virtues whiles they here in this present world were living And I have
not desire to see only the men passed out of this life / which I know by
sight and by conuersacyon / But namely I have desire for to see aftir my death
them / of whom I have herd speak / and them of whom I have read by histories
and them of whom I have wreten amo^gys them whom I vndirstonde that they be
made inmortelle by their precedent meritys / fforsoth there is no man that
lightly should hold me to the love of this wordly life / since that I am in the
wey for to goo with them which be made inmortalle / And also there is no man
that lightly should make me turn again from the weye by the which men passyn
out of this present life / How be it that some fonned and folisshe old men
desiren it again / I would that men would drive them and return them again in
to young age as men retournen a balle from oon merk to anothir / And if some god
would give me puissaunce that I which am an old man / might return again in
to childhode / and that I should braye and krye in my swathyng cloth and in my
cradelle like a child / I would it not / but I would even refuse it / If ye
demand me what / and how great prouffite and avail is / to be in this life I
answer you / that there is more labor than prouffite But for to say the
trowthe / this life conteyneth both that one and that other / That is to wit /
prouffite and labor / And neuirtheles this present life conteyneth anothir
fulfillyng or mesure / And old men have their fulle certeynte of this life /
ffor the men of the other five ages / have term and mesure of certain nombre
of yeeris / ffor childhode conteyneth seven yeris And so of the other four
following / fforsoth it likes me not to weep or sorrow in any wise / by cause
that my life is not longer / And certain it is / that many men as foolys have
wepid and mourned / ffor this same cause / And also I repent me not of that /
that I have lived tille the time of old age / ffor I have so parfytely lived /
that I trow not that I have be in the world for nowght / nor in vain / I
depart me from this present life / as a walkyng weyfaryng man or as a
voyagieng pilgryme departith from some lodgyngplace or an hostellrye / for to
come to his own dwelling house / But I depart me not from this life as the
lord departs from his own house / ffor this passable life is nowght else
but as a lodgyng place or an hostellrye / But the life to come is the
stablement and the propre house of mine vndedly soul / ffor nature modir of
all things has youen to us men lodgyng for to dwell to gedyr / But she has
not geuyn to us no house euir to inhabit / Thenke ye Scipion and Lelyus how
noble be that dyuyne counceille and that noble assamble wherein only shall be
the souls of deed men / To the which Counceille I Caton shall goo as soon as I
shall depart from this troublous life and from this filthe / fforsoth I shall
goo to the dyuyne cou^ceille / not only of the men of whom I have before
spokyn / but namely at the departing from this life / I shall goo with the young
Caton my sone / which was so good a man that his bettir was neuir borne of
modyr / nor more excellent in pytye nor in religion / I have brent and beryed
the body of my Sone Caton hou be it that other wise should had be aftir course
of nature That is to wit / that my body old and ancient owght to have be
brent and beryed by my sone / The soul of my sone Caton left me not / but his
soul which lokyd and beheeld that I should come to him is turned and with
drawn in certain placys of heuyn in the which it is auised as I hope that I
should come to / aftir mine old age / And true it is Scipion and Lelyus that
it has seemyd you that I did bear and suffer with good and strong courage the
death of young Caton my sone / But forsooth I did not bear it nor suffer it not
by so strong / nor by so pacient a courage / But I had thereof sorrow and
trowble / But I conforted me thenkyng in my Courage that betwixt us two / should
not be so long space of places aftir this present life / Ye Scipion and Lelius
say at the beginning of this book / that ye were wont to wonder and merueile
hou mine old age might be to me soft easy and sweet in thies two things /
which seemyn sharp and byttir for to suffer / That is to wit / mine old age
and the hasty death of my good sone Caton / And I have told you that mine old
age is to me both sweet and light / And it is not only much chargyng / but it
is Ioyouse and glad to me / by cause that I thenk and deem for certain that
the soul neuir dies / But if it be in error and out of truth aftir the
doctrine and scole of Epycures / by cause that I believe that the souls be
vndedly and Inmortelle perdurable and euirlastyng / I answer you that this
error pleasith me / and I consent me in it right gladly / and as long time as
I live I will not that any philosopher / nor any other / of what condicyon
that euir he be / take awey fro me this error / wherein I delight me / ffor if
aftir this present life I be deed / aswele in soul as in body as that some
young and small philosophers of which men name Epycures that affermyn /
Certain it is / that I shall feel nothing / And also I am not afferde that
such philosophers so ded / mockyn me nor of this mine oppinion / Aftir which
I verily believe that the souls be vndedly / But ye may demand me / what we
old men ought to do / eythir to desire to live longer / or to desire the death
/ and to be content to have lived tille old age / I answer you / that though
the souls were not vndedly / yet every man ought to desire that he dye in his
time / That is to wit / in old age / ffor the nature of man has in hit
certain term for to live / as have the other things of the world / which
all dyen / or fallyn or fayllen aftir they have acconplisshed and fulfilled
their course of age / Now it is true that aftir the five first ages / old age
is the accomplisshing and the fullfylyng of the life of men / We also owght not
desire to live oiur old age / as I show it you by this exsample / The poet /
which rehercith in the Scene in some ffable / owght to be ware that he make
not werye / and that he noye not his heerers by over long rehercyng the ffable
/ So that men owght not desire to live ouir old age / Seeing pryncypally that
in that age or neuir / he is fulle weerye for to live / I have had in my
thought for to tell you of old age / as ye have herd here / To the which I
desire that ye may come / to thentente that by experynce of death / ye may preue
tho thyngys which ye have herd of me / which be by me wretyn in this my book
callid old age:

to whom I knew none like emonge the lords of the temporalite in science and
moral virtue / I beseech almighty god to have mercy on his soul / and pray al
them that shall here or read this lityl treatys much virtuous of friendship in
like wise of your charity to remember his soul among your prayers / And by
cause this work was made by the prince of Eloquence Tulluis entitled de
Amycicia aftir that he had acheuid his book de senectute / as hertofore ye may
more plainly see at large / then me seems it requisite and necessary that I
set in following the said book / this book de Amicicia / which by gods
grace shall plainly follow Cicero de Amicicia

qUintus Mucius Augur Seuola / This was his name / which was wont to tell
many things merely / And by mind of Celius / Lelyus his fader in law / And
he was not aferde to call him a wise man in all his sayenges / To the which
Seuola I was putt by my fader / And aftir that I had taken the clothyng due to
the astate of man / while I might or that it was leeful to come so to do / I
neuir departed fro that good old mannys side / of whom I learned many things
disputed ripely / And many things said compendiously / And behouely such I
bare away / doing my pain by means of his wisdom to find my self the better
taught / And after his decesse / I was with anothir Seuola a bishop. the which
I dare well say the most excellent man in wisdom and Justice. But no force of
that at this time / I will return to the first Seuola. when he lyked to tell
us of many things sittyng in his chayer. as he was wont to do at home. as I
am well remembrid while I was there and few of my servants with him / Hit
fortuned him to fall in such speech. as well nyghe in every man's mouth in this
wise saying. Attice ye remember well as I trow. and much the rather that ye
were conuersaunt with Publius Supplicius when he was one of the Trybunys of the
people. how he fill at varyau^ce / and at dedly hate with him Quintus Pompeyus
that time Consul / And sith he had lived with him in great nyghnes of love. How
great marvel and complaynt was had of the people. ye your self known well /
And when Seuola had fallen thus in this langage / he declared thus the words
which Lelyus had used unto him of friendship / and his sone in law Faunyus the
sone of Marcus within few days aftir the death of Scipio Affrycan. The
sentences of the which disputaco^n / I bare surely in my remembrance. And
have disposed the same in this book. as me seems / and therewith introduced the
same persons in spekyng to gyders / lest if I made my book othirwise / I
should use to often / quoth I / And quoth he / And therefore much the rather I
did it / that it should seem / as if the same persons had the same langage /
And Attice sith ye have often entreted me to write somewhat of friendship / It
seems me / that it sets me right well to do so / As well for it was a thing
due and necessary to the knowleche of all people / as to the great familyarite
and friendship between us tweyne / Therefore I have obeyed not vngladly thentent /
that by thaccomplissheme^t of your desire. I should mow do prouffyte to many
one. but in like wise as I did in my book which I wrote unto you of age
entitled Cato Mayor. where I enduced the old Cato disputyng of age. ffor so
much / as he was seemed to me the most apt person in that behalue I mean to
speak of age / Also sith he was of so many yeris above all other. like wise
sith I wndirsta^de by our faders the memorable familyarite used between Gayus
Lelyus and Publius Scipio Amore apt person. I could not remember to dyssyde
better the matter of friendship / than the seid Lelius / namely sith my master
Seuola remembrid unto me / how Lelyus has resonned with him in the same matier
/ And I can not remember me / how my work should mow seem of gretter weight
and auctorite. than if I cause the words which I shall use to come from their
breasts / which ben known of grettest auctorite and worship. Therefore when I
read my owen works I am disposed sometime. that I deem Cato speaks and not I.
But as that time I brought in an aged man to speak with another of age. so in
this book I most friendly to the my friend write of friendship. That time spak
Cato whose older then could not be found / ne in his days his wiser. Now
Lelius both wise and expert. so he is reputed / and excellent in the souerayn
fame of friendship spekith of amytee or friendship. and of one I pray you to take heed a lytil while to the excuco^n of this desire / and me ymagynyng alwey that
the same Lelyus spekyth

Thus ends the prologue
cUeus ffaunyus and Quintus Mucius / came to their fader in law / aftir the
death of Scipio Affrycan / by whom the matier was minystred / and Lelius made
their answer / The disputaco^n was all of friendship / the which if it plese
you to read / ye shall better apperceyue / Faunyus / Is this true Lelius / or
no / that there was neuir a better ne a more worshipful man / than was Scipio
Affrycan / yet ye may trow for certain / that all folks have their eyes cast
upon you / And they hold and believe verily that ye ar to be set alone / and
first in the lawde of wisdom / Marcus Cato was in like wise / we know well
that Lelyus Attilius was called wise / ffor that he was well learned in law
Cyuyle / And Cato had his fame / ffor that he had use and experyence of many
things / ffor diverse things as well in the senate as in open place / were
showed by him prudently / proved stedfastely excuted / and quyckly answered /
And therefore in his age he was called Cato the wise / But as to you ye have the
name of wisdom / not only / ffor that ye have it by a manner of nature and use
/ but also by study and doctrine / not as the common people / But as the well
vndirstondyng men are wont to call a wise man / which say ye have not your
felawe in all greece / ffor though so be / they that answer subtylly / varye
in their opynyons from other folks / which put seven to be callid wise men
/ we have understand one in Athenes / And that he was so showed and Iuged by
the answer of Appollo / But they through such wisdom to be in you that ye
suppose / hou ye have nothing but such as is your plenare power / And therewith
every fortune hap or change be subget to virtue / which causes Seuola here
present / And me to pray you / that we may understand / how ye take the death
of Scipio Affrycan / and much the rather / since at our assemblee / this other
day in the gardyn of Decius Brutus / so were we woonte to entrecomyne of
diverse matiers concerning our weel publik / ye were not present / where ye ne
faylled in times past with all diligence there taccomplissh your dutee /
Seuola / Some men demand me and many of my felaws / ffaunyus in like wise as
it is said before / the cause I mean of your absence from that place / And I
have answered as I have thought / layeng the cause unto the sorrow / which ye
have late taken / saying that how be it your wisdom took moderatly the death of
so worshipful a man and so especail friend / yet your humanyte might not suffer
you to be free of diseace and sorrow And that ye were not present in our
company / at that day / I said it was rather long on your diseace / than
sorrow / Lelyus / fforsothe Seuola / even as it was ye said / I wot right well
for any thing / that should have touched my self if I had been of power / I
should not have been thens ne have fawted in my dutee / And namely in that / that
I have not be used to fault in / ne I can suppose that a lytil thing should
mow happen to any man well disposed auised or steadfast / that he should seace at
any time of the doing of his duete / And as to you ffaunyus / which lay so
great thing of worship to me / and so much that my self know not thereof ne
desire the same / ye do that as my friend / but as me seems / ye deem not a
right of Cato / ffor either there was never wise man / And that I believe well /
or else if there were any / he was one / as in setting all other things aside
in that / that he suffered so euenly the death of his sone I can remember Paulus
and I have seen Gayus / but beware that ye not compare either of thise / with
Cato the man of grettest auctorite and most set by / ne yet prefer him our
Cato whom Appollo Iuged to be wysest / ffor Socrates was praised for his saying
/ And Cato for his deades / And as for me sith I must speak with you both /
vndirstande me in this wise / if I shall nay my self to be moeued with the death
of Scipio / whether I shall mow do so truly / I report me to all wise men /
ffor I know my self well / that I shall so saying make a lefynge / no doubt of
I am moved ffor the lack of such a friend / ffor his semblable as I trow in
friendship was neuir / And I dar well say / there was neuir none such But me
needs no medecynes / I will comfort my self / And pryncypally with this
comfort / that I lak that error / that causes other to be of the vexyd when
their friends decesse / I trow there might no thing come to Scipio of evil /
And if there did I had my part therein Who so euir he be that in the diseace of
his friend soroweth he shows him self the very lover of his friend / Who is
he / that may say nay / but that he is right well departed from this world /
on less that he be such one / that sets lytil or nothing by inmortalite /
And what is that he had not / that was lee full to any man to wisshe / did not
he surmounte the great hope of all the Cyteseyns / which they had of him the
time of his childhode / when that he came to thestate of man / by his incredible
virtue / he never showed to be made Consul / and twyes enjoyed he that astate /
the first time before or he was ripe of years / The second time / when he was
of age convenient / And yet almost to late for our weel publik / ffor he
euerted two great Cytees to Rome / the most capitayl enemies / and with one
battle depressyd not only the field made against him / but many other feldes
and batailles Immynent / and lykely if the victory had not then fallen on his
side / What shall I say of his goodly manners / of his pity / which he used to
his mother / liberalite to his susters / bou^te to his friends / and Justice to
all folks since they be not unknown to you / And hou well-beloved he was in our
cytee / the complaint made about his heers bears sufficient witness what
helps then the addyng to / of few years unto Scipio ffor sothe age though
it be not grievous / as I am remembered Cato said the year before he deyed in
comynycacyon had between him Scipio and me / yet it has taken away the
grenesse and lustynesse which Scipio had at that time / neuirtheles he was
such in life / fortune / and glory / that there might nothing there unto be
added / The hastynesse of his deyeng took away the felyng of his death from him
/ hou be dyed it is hard to say / what men deem / ye see well / Neuirthelesse
this I may well say / among all tho days which were of grettest worship and
gladness to Scipio / That day next before the day of his death / when he departed
out of the senate / he was conduyted and accompanied home with the faders
conscript / The people of rome with their strangers under their obeyssaunce
and amytee / and with the latyns was to him the day of grettest worship And
then fro that high degree of astate / it seemed him suddenly to be called up
much rather to the gods above than to the gods bynethe / Ne I can not
hold with them which have bygonne lately the opinion / to hold that the
souls dye with their bodies / and that death makes so an end of all attones
/ ffor the auctorite of folks of old time is thereto contrary / with which I
hold gretely / and to our elders / which have acquyted them so relygiously /
which have deyed in their times / And that they ne would have done / if they
had trowed so / hit had not apperteyned in any wise to them / or the auctorite
of them which have been in our cytee / and some time have with their holsom
precepts and laws yeuen sufficient doctrine to great Greece that time flowryng
/ and now wasted and destroyed / or his auctorite that was called the wisest by
Appollo / which said not now this / Now that / as he did in many other
things / but alwey abode ferme in this saying / that the souls of men ben
dyuyne / And when they depart from the bodies / if they have been good and
just in their living / their way unto heaven is open and right spedy to all
such / And so it was seemed unto the same Scipio / ffor right a few days
before that he deyed / when Philus and Manylius were present and your self
Seuola and diverse other three days to gydre he disputed of our estate publik /
and the conclucion was of the inmortalite of the soul / the which he said
and learned of Scipio Affrican by vysion of his sleep / Then if it so be that
the soul of every excellently good man / shall depart lightly in the lightest
wise in his deyeng / as for the keeping and bonds of the body / to whom should /
we deem that / Aliter / Ascence was granted unto him namely of the gods than
unto Scipio / Wherefore I dar not complain his fortune / lest than I be thought
rathir to him envious than friendly / if othirwise perauenture I were aferde /
lest the death of the body and the soul were all one / and so as there is
nothing of good in death / so in like wise there is nothing of evil in the same
/ ffor when the felyng is goon from a man / he were as good / he had neuir be
born / yet we are glad that euir Scipio was born / and so shall this cite ben as
long as it shall endure / Therefore as I said above / he is well deled with all /
and I more brusly dealt with all than right would / ffor since I entered in to
this lif before him / I should by reason have deyed before him / Neuirtheles I
use so ioyously the remembrance of our friendship / that me seemed I lived
prosperously / ffor that I have had and leyed my life with Scipio / with whom my
charge of things concerning our estate publyk and pryuate were even departed /
and with whom in werre and peace was alwey one / And in that wherein rested the
grettest force of friendship / our wills / studyes / and felynges were all one
/ Therefore the untrue fame of this wisdom / which ffaunyus has remembered me
/ to have delited me / not so greatly as does this / I trust that the
remembrance of the friendship between me and Scipio shall ever endure / And so
much the more joyous to me it is / that in all worlds passed / uneath three
or four couple of such friends be named / among which / I trust that the
frendlyhod of Scipio with Lelyus shall be known / to all them which shall come
aftir us / ffaunyus / Lelyus it must be as ye say / but since ye have made
mention of frendlihode / and that we ben at good leyser / ye shall do to me a
thing / and so I trow to Seuola wonder agreeable / namely if ye shall please as
ye were wont to done in all other things of you demanded / to dispute in
this matier of friendship what ye feel / what ye repute and what preceptys ye
will give to the same / Seuola / Hit shall be to me right agreeable / that ye so
dispute / Neuirtheles ffaunyus took out of my mouth the thing that I would have
said / wherefore not only to ffaunius / but to me. ye shall do a thing of great
pleasyr. Lelyus. Hit shall not grieve me so to do / if I were assured of my self
/ ffor no doubt of the matier is right notable. And as ffaunyus says we be at
good leyser. But what manner man am I. or what is my habylite. The custo^me of
learned men is this. and the greeks have the same. to have a matier purposed
unto them. And they recke neuir though it come suddenly. upon the which they
will dispute. but that is a great work. and such as needs not a lityl
excersice. wherefore touching such things as may be disputed of amytee / I will
advise you to desire it of them / which take upon them such things But thus
forsothly I may exhort you that ye prefer amyte / to fore all other humayne
things / fforsothe there is no thing so conuenyent / and verily apt to men
either in prosperity or aduersite / But this I deem first / ffrendship may not
be in other / than in good folks / And yet I will not goo so nere the quycke /
as to say that it may not be / but in good folks / as peradventure some will
so hold / the which enserchyng the matier curiously / and perauenture trewly
/ but for our well publik easily they deny any man to be good if he be not
wise / well be it so / but then they make such an interpretacion of wisdom /
that as yet no mortal man could atteyne the like thereof / But let us take heed
thereof rather of the things that been in the commyne use and life of man than of
such things / as ben ymagyned or desired to be ffor I shall neuir call Gayus
ffabrycius Marcus curious or Titus cornucanus / which our forffadres held wise
/ if I should follow that rule / wherefore let they them which give such
interpretacyon of wisdom take the name of wisdom to them self / The which
name is right envious and derke / or let them grant / that the said persons
were good / And that forsothe they ne shall but deny / that name of goodness
to be granted to any / but to wise men / And let us be more plain and blonte
Then such as say / that they deem them self and their life so / that their
faith / holiness of manners / ffelysship and lyberalyte may be showed / And
that there is in them no couetise of worship / lust / or undue hardynes / but
gre / te steadfastness like wise as was in them whom I have named above. let
us Judge thise good men. as they were holden so to be called. the which get as
forsothly as men may the best nature to their guide in all their living. Me
seems that I should so use to be so born. That there should be a manner of
felisship among all persons And much the rather. that every man has an
inclynacion unto the same / So that one cyteseyn draw rather to an other /
than one stranger to another / And tho that been of kynne / rather than tho
that been fer of. ffor nature her self has brought forth friendship in this
excellent kynrede. but from friendship neuir for to take awey benyuolence / ffor
th^^ne take awey the name of friendship And so it is not in nyghnesse of blood.
And how great the force of friendship is. by this it may best be vndirstanden.
ffor among the infenyte company of mankind. which nature has gotten to her
self. it is a thing so narowly brought to gydre / and drawyn so streyte. that
all manner of love restith between tweyne. or between right few. ffrendship
fforsothe is nothing ellis but the knyttyng to gydre of that thing that is
goodly. and of that thing that is humayne with sovereign benyuolence and
charity. And I wot never. on less than it were wisdom. what bettir thing
might be granted unto man by the gods Inmortall / Neuirthelesse some say /
that richesse is bettir than it. And some heal / And some power. and some
worship. and some pleasaunce. But the last is a beestely opinion. And the
thyngys before / ben full slyper / and uncertain / and not only putt in our
disposicions / but in folehardynesse of fortune / They forsooth which putt the
highest well in virtue. put her right well and notably / and as they should do
/ but the self virtue brings forth friendship and continues / ffor ffrendship
may be in no wise without virtue / But now let us make an interpretacyon of
virtue according to the comune spekyng and living / ne let us amesure it aftir
the magnyficence of words / as though we were greatly learned our self / but
let us call them good men / which ben holden good / as Paulos / Catones /
Gayos / Scipiones and Philos / The comune life is content with them / and let
us forgete them / that can by no manner be found in any place emonge such men
as I reherced before / ffrendship has so many oportunytees / that I may
uneath reherce them / And first of all / who is he / that may be leefully in
this life / as Enneus says / that restith not / in the good joint or good will
of some friend / And what may be more plesaunt / than to have such a friend /
that ye may speak thereby such fruit in things prosperous / if ye ne had some
one to enjoy of your prosperity as gretely as your self / and how hard were it
/ to suffer things adverse without one / which would be soryer / for your
aduersite than your self / fforsoth other things / which ben gretely desired
ben right behofful every thing with other / As richesse for use / plente for
reverence / worship for lawde or fame / plesaunce for gladness / And heal for
lack of pain / and for the use of the gifts of the body / But friendship
conteyneth many things / whyther so ever ye turn you it is ready / hit is putt
out in no place / ffor it is neuir slow. it is neuir grievous / Therefore as
they say / we use not fire or water in moo places / than we use friendship / Ne
I speak not now of the vulgar and mean oppynyon of friendship. which
peradventure should both delight and prouffyte / But of that friendship which is
very and parfyght / like to theirs / which have been but few in nombre deserved
/ so to be called / no doubt of. ffrendship embelisshyth prosperyte / releueth
aduersyte / And is partener to both / But by side the manyfolde great
commodyte / is that friendship has in him self in this / it does excel
merueyllously above that. that it does in any other / That is to say / that it
yeueth good hope to our life / which we are to live / and suffers not our
minds neither to be enfebled ne overthrown / Also forsothe who so euir sees
his friend / sees a manner likeness of him self / Therefore when they ben
absente / they ben nygh to gydre / And when they ben nedy / they habounde in
goods / And when they ben feeble / they ben of great force / And that which is
hardest to believe / when they be deed they live / So great is the desire. so
great is the worship. so great is the remembrance of friendship. Sith that
their death is thought so blessid. and their life is thought so worshipful. And
take awey from nature the joined good will of things. and neither hows ne
cytee. ne tylthe of land shall remain. And if this be to lytil to vndirstonde
the force of friendship and acorde by. hit may be aperceyued by his contrary.
that is to say by varyaunce and debate. ffor where may be found an household
so stable. or a cytee so ferme. that may not be overthrown by mean of hate
and discord / by the which it may be sone Iuged / how good a thing friendship
is / They say that a man named Agrigentinus / well learned in the dytees of
greece / by manner of prophecye had this langage / what so euir it be in the
nature of things / or in all the world / which has a naturell mouyng /
desires his like / and flees his contrary / And every naturel man
understands and preyseth friendship / And disprayseth and rebukes enemytee /
In so much that when any man / has taken thoffice of a friend upon him / in
adressyng of him self to parell / or in taking part of Ieobardye with his
friend / who is he / that prayseth not his dead in the highest wise / what
cry and noise caused the tragedye played in the house of mine host and my friend
Marcus potumus when Thoas there prsent sought Orestes / and enserched so
narowly / that he came to the place / where he found tweyne of the which he
knew that he was one. Pylades his felawe there / which took upon him then
the name of Orestes of full will and purpoos to dye for him / And the said
Pylades Orestes felawe then constantly saying yet am I he / which ye have
sought and not Pylades / how glad the people were when they saw this played and
feyned ye know well And how much more glad trow we / they would have been. if
they had seen it done in very deed / there nature showed verily her force /
when tho men which might not do it them self / they Iuged excellently well
done in another / Hither to me seems I might say that / which I felt of
friendship / if there be any things to be said ferther. as I trow there ben
many. then ask ye of them / which takyn upon them to dispute like matters
Faunyus. We had liver hyere it of you / though I have demanded / and herd it
of other not again my will^ But we look all aftir another manner thread of your
spynnyng / Seuola ffaunyus. ye would much the rather say so. if ye had be
present a lytil before the death of Scipio. when my fader Lelyus and he disputed
of our estate publycque / when he was so great / and so strong a protector of
right wisnesse / again the studied reasons of Philus / Faunyus. Hit was easy for
him / which was most Just him self / to defend the part of Justice. Seuola
What say ye. and why not as lightly friendship. by the which he has gotten / in
showing of him self steadfast and faithful / therein souerayn glory / Lelyus
fforsothe ye are about tenforce me / but it is but lytil to be taken head of /
by what mean ye co^streyne me / but no doubt. and ye enforce me / hard it is
/ and not with equity. to withsaye your pleasirs / which ben my sons in law
/ And namely in that thing. which is good. fful often when I have remembrid my
self of friendship. I have been acustomed. to thenke whether / that friendship
should be desired / in time of feblenesse and need / so that one shol^de
receive / or give to another / of benefayttes to be yeuen or taken / that thing
that he might not atteyne to by him self / and whethyr this was very due or
propre to friendship / but me seems there was another cause better / fayrer /
and more natural / And that is love of whom amytee has his name / ffor of
Amor comyth Amicicia And that love is the pryncypal / and the chief thing in
ioynyng of good will. ffor prouffyt is often had of them whom we worship and
observe by the colors of friendship acordyng to the seasons / but in very
friendship / there is nothing feyned or dyssymyled / And what someuir is in
friendship / it has his beginning rather of nature / than of need or indigence^
And that it comes rather of applieng of man's will. to the felyng that he
has to love. than of the thought he has. what prouffyte should grow thereby.
ffor what is it in it self. it may be soon espied in beestys. which loves
them that they bring forth for a certain time / And be as well byloued again.
so that the felyng of friendship is sone apperceyued in such beestys. But much
more evidently in man / ffyrst by that charity and love parfyght / which is
between the childeren / and fader and mother / which may not be dysseuerid
without great and detestable offense / Secondly if there be a like felyng in
other persons of love / as thus. if we may get any man acordyng to our manner
and nature / of whom we may see the light of prowess and virtue / ffor no
doubt of / there is nothing more amyable than virtue / ffor it happeth often /
that we love them. whom we did never see / ffor their virtue and probyte /
Who is he / that uses not the remembrance of Cueus Fabrycius and Marcus
Curious with a manner of charity and beneuole^ce / and yet we neuir saw them /
and there again / who is he / that hates not Tarqnynus Superbus. Publius Cassius
/ and Spurius Melius. We have fowghte with two princes in ytalye for the
soueraynte / and they were Pirrus and Hanybal And as touching the first / we
owe him no great evil will / for the probyte and prowess which we felt in him
/ and the second this cite shall neuir but hate him for his cruelnesse / Then
if there be so great force in probite that we love in them. which we neuir saw
/ and much more in our enemy / What merueyle is it / though the courages of
men ben / greatly moeued / when it seems them that they may see virtue and
prowess in them / with whom they may be famulyer / Though love be confermed
by benefaytes taken / and love vndirstanden / and often famylyaryte. The which
things Joined with the first mocion of courage and love / causes a man
merueyllous encreas of fervent benyuolence / Therefore and who some ever trow
that it proceeds of feblenesse or impotencie. or that the said feblenesse
should be the moyen to attain. to that which they desire in friendship /
Sothly they leave the beginning of friendship. to humble / to bare / and to
vnworshipfull / sith that they will / that it should spring of wretchidnesse
and indigence / And if that were true / who so ever were leest of reputacyon
and hauoure. were most apt to friendship. And that is all other wise / ffor
als so much more / as a man is most asured in the most saufgarde of virtue
and wisdom. so that he has no need of any other outward help / but thinks
that in him self is / all that he has need of / so much the more is he
excellent in frendshippes to be atteyned. what need had Scipio Affrycan to me /
fforsothe none. Ne I of him / but I by a manner of admyracyon of his virtues
loved him / And he having some good oppynyon peradventure loved me / And our
customme and famylyaryte^ encreaced our benyuolence / And though right great
and much prouffyte enfiewed to either of us / by the same. yet it was not the
cause. that made us first to love / ffor we be lyberall and glad to do good.
Not for that we look aftir a reward of duete. ffor then our benefayte were
grounded upon usure / But we be naturelly ready to thadminystracyon of fredom So
and in like wise / we be enduced to believe / that friendship should not be used
for the hope of reward / But for the fruit. that grows of the same / and
that is love. Neuirtheles I am in all wyses of diverse oppynyon from the
folks. which aftir their beestely sensualyte / putt the beginning of
friendship in flesshely lust / And what meruaille is. though they which so do
/ may see nothing which is high / worthy to be magnefyed or dyuyne / sith
that they set their minds and thoughts. upon a thing so simple and vile.
Therefore let us set a side all such from our communycacyon / And let us
vndirstande / that the felyng of love / and thentiernesse of good will comes
of nature / with the sygnefyeng of prouesse from either party / the which
sygnyfycacyon of love / who some ever they be that desire it. they apply them
self as nyghe as they can / to such as they have bygonne to love. that they
may enjoy their custommes and manners. so that they may be even and egall in
manner of loving / and more ready to merit well of their friend / than to ask
again / the thing that they have meryted well in / Such worshipful stryf should
be alwey between them / that is to say Who so mow do most for other / so
great prouffytes shall grow of their friendship / And this beginning of
friendship / which proceeds of nature shall be more weyghty and verray / than
that which proceeds of need / ffor if so be that prouffit should be the cause
of knyttyng of friendship / When so euir that prouffyt faylleth. friendship is
loosed / but for as much / as nature may not be changed the frendlyhodes
which grow of nature / be most ferme / and lengest enduryng / ye see now als
far as I can show / the beginning / and the first Origenal of amytee /
Please it you any other thing / Faunyus Go forth Lelyus as ye have bygonne we
pray you / ffor I may take upon me to answer lawfully for him / that is
younger than I / Seuola Brother ye do not amys / therefore let us here our
fader in law / Lelyus Right worshipful sons / here now the things. which
were often dyssyded. between me and Scipio of friendship. Neuirthelesse he seide
full often / that there was nothing more hard to be byleued / than that friendship
might endure between tweyne / unto their last life days / ffor he said / it
happeth right often. that some one thing is expedyent to one. that is not
expedyent to that other / Also in thestate publyque / they varye in thayr
opynyons / There with he said the manners of men ben often changed / Some
changed them in their aduersyte / Some in their prosperyte. Some in their
grievous years. And that is in their old age / And he took his exsample of his
first flouryng ages / Saying that some childeren love in the highest wife / till
they come to the age of seuenten / and then change / And if they happen to
continue to the years of force and iustynesse / either for the love of wymmen /
or for couetyse of good / they shall fall at stryf and debate. And that is for
that they both / may not have one thing / and if they pass that time / of
continuance of friendship / till they ben of ryper years. it happeth often the
same friendship to febbe and faylle / if they fall in stryf for worship. A
gretter sore can not be in friendship / than the couetyse of good / which vex
men greatly / But the most hurt of friendship is / when they which ben much
worshipful. strive for worship and glory / of the which stryf. most dedly
enemyte has happed often between them / which have been most friendly / Also
we have seen of great debates for the more part / when some thing have been
desired. and asked vnresonably of friends. as that one will pray the other to
be a mynystre of his lust / or an helper of his wrong / the which thing /
when he refuses to do / though he do so acordyng to worship / yet is he
blamed of unkindness. And the breach of friendship by such as would not
serve to their ententes / And then they say. that there is nothing. that
their friend would desire of them. but that they would do it gladly for their
sakes / So by this old manner of quarellyng / ffamylyaryte has not only be
set a side / But also perpetuel hate. has grown of the same / So Scipio
said it seemed him / how frendlyhode is subgete to so many fawtes and parellys
/ that it is not only thoffice of a wysman / but of a gracious man to fle it /
ffor so much then / beat us see first. if it shall so plese you. how love
should proceed in friendship. how suppose ye though^ Coriobanus had frend^s /
should they have werred with him against their owen co^tree and cite / And what
Besilinus which desired to be a king among us / or Melius we have seen Tiberius
Gracchus weyeng our estate publyque / fforsaken of Quyntinus Tubero and such
other his friends. And Cueus Blaxius a Cuman born And your host Seuola. when
he came to me that same time present Lemates and Rupilius that same time being
consuls / prayeng me that I would spare him making his cause / for that he
set so much by Gracchus. that what so ever he had commanded him to do. him
thought / it was leeful to him to do the same / Then I asked him if he had
commanded the to have brought fire to have burnt the capytoyle with / would
thou have done so. he said. But and he had commanded me so / I would have
obeyed his commandment / how think ye was not this a cursyd answer / And
forsothe he did / as he said / ffor he not only obeyed to the folyssh
presumpcyon of Tyberyus Gracchus / but therewith helped it forth as far / as
was to him possible / so he made not him self the servant of his wodenesse /
but over that / the guide and the conduytour of the same / therefore his madness
was fresshe inquired of / and he therefore sore aferde fled in to Asie to our
enemies. and suffered for the same grievous and Just pains / Therefore I say it
is none excuse of sin. when a man says he did it / by cause of his friend /
ffor sith that virtue is the verray knotte of friendship it is hard for
friendship to abide. when men depart fro virtue. ffor if that we think
resonabl^ to grant unto our faders all yt they would have of us. or to desire
of theyin. all that we would have of them late us be of so parfyght wisdom /
that in our desires ne theyres. be any thing of vice / But for so much as we
speak of such friends as we see / or of such as we remembre^ that been here in
this common life emonge us. it is best we take our exsamples of them. and in
especial of them / which drawn next unto wisdom We have seen Publius Emilius
right cou^ersaunt and familyer with Lucinius / And as we have vndirstande by
our faders they were twyes called both attones to estate and dignyte / ffirst
they were made both Consoris and countrollers of manners / Also it is wreton
how Marcus curious and Titus cornucacius were greatly joined to thise forsaid in
friendship and good will / And between these tweyne / that I last spak of / was
great love / And it is not to be demed / that any of thise / desired of his
friend that. which should be contrary to his faith / to his promysse or to
his estate publyque / what nedith to speak of such things of thise folks /
which were so good and holy / ffor if any man had desired any such thing of
them / he would not have obtained it / ffor it is like offense to desire such a
thing / to asseeth the same desire / what though Cueyus Carbo and Cueyus Cato.
were of the the bend of Gracchus and Cueyus Frater / yet now he is his
grettest enemy. Therefore let this now in friendship be confermed / That we
desire / nothings of his inhoneste^ And though other folks desire such
things of us / that we agree not there unto. It is a foul excuse. and in no
wise to be resceyued / ne in that / that touched our estate publyque / ne yet
in smaller offenses / when one says / that for my friends sake I did amys /
But we be brought to that plyght Faunyus and Seuola / that we have great need
to forse^ right well / what shall need to our estate public / ffor the good
custommes of our oolders ben greatly set a side / out of the place and way /
that they were in / Titus Gracchus peyned him self to be a king and regne upon
us / and if I shall say more truly / he reigned. though it were but few
months / The people of Rome had not herd ne seyn a like thing. And Gracchus
friends and kynnesmen aftir his death / followed his stappes / I may not tell
you without terys / what they did against Publius Scipio we endured Carbo / of
the which we spak right now / for the new and fresshe pain / that Titus
Gracchus suffered what we should look after / ffor the office of trybune. that
Cueyus Gracchus occupies. me list not to deuyne / But I see well. the thing
crepeth / the which when it has ones be bygo^ne it fallith to ready destruco^on
/ See ye not in your minds. the spotte which is in the table before that it
is made first caused of the law. which Gabynus made. And within two year by
the law that Gassius made / me seems that I see the people disseuerid from
the Cene. And the grettest thing langyng to our estate publyque. excuted aftir
the will of multitude / that will have them. And there be moo that shall learn /
how such things should be practiced / Then how they should be let / but
to what entente say I thus. but for this cause. that I wot well there is no man
/ that will attempt so great works. but he be sure of many felaws to assiste
him. Therefore thoos which ben good / should be advertised / that if they fallen
vnwytyngly of ignorance in such manner of felawships / that they should trow
them self so bounden to such frendys / that if they trespace against our
estate publyque / that they ne should depart from them / ffor pain is alwey
due to them that offenden / And it is nolesse due to them that been their
felaws and parteners in the same Crime / than unto them that were their leders
/ and setters on / Who was clerer and more mighty in greece than Themystocles /
when he was Emperor / he delyuerd all greece of seruytude / by the bataille
which he had against them of perse / Aftirward for envy / when he was putt in
exile / He suffered not the wrong of his unkind cou^ntree. the which / he
should in all wise have suffered / but did in like wise there / as Coriolanus
did here with us not twenty year a goo / that could not find one of his
Cytezeyns / that would help him in the war against his owen co^tree / and
therefore either of hem slough^ wilfully him self / wherefore such conspiracye of
them that be noughty / is not to be couerd and closed by thexcuse of friendship
/ but much rather to be avenged of that No man sh^old trow that it is suffered
or granted / that no friend should help another / by color of friendship /
which would werre unto his owen contree / ffor there be but few men that
known / when a thing is bygonne / what the end and thissue of the same shall be
/ But as for me I take no less care to think / what our estate public shall
be aftir my death / than I do think what it is at this day / Then late this
first law of friendship be stablisshed. that we desire nothing of our frendys.
but that is worshipful. ne do nothing for their sakes / but such as is
acordyng to worship / And if we know any such thing let us tarry / till we be
prayed. but let our mind and study be set all upon it / setting all
caryeng a side. let us be glad to give hem true cou^seill freely for the
auctoryte of friends in that. which they advise well / helps greatly in
friendship / And sometime that we should advertise them not openly / but therewith
sharply if the caas require it / And they should obey such counseils
dilygently / ffor I trow diverse things right merueylous have been thought
good / to such men as emonge the greeks / that have been called right wise /
but there is nothing / that they ne find some fault in by their wylles / Some of
them would / that a man should eschew over great plente of ffrendes / lest he
allone should be driven of necessite to take care for many / it is ynowgh / and
to much sometime they say / to take heed to that. which belongs to a man
him self / And to peyneful to be medelous in other men's matters / and most
behoefull to have a slak reyne upon friendship. That when one will. he may
restrain it / or let it loos at his playsyr. And they seye / the best thing
that may be to live welefully / is to be void of care / And that may not a man
be. that trauaylleth and vexith his mind for many. And some I here say. speak
more vncurtaysly / the which I have somewhat said sharply to fore / They say
that friendship should not be sought / for the getyng of love / and good will /
but as every man is weykest and of leest power / so should he seek grettest
frendshippis. or the frendshippe of grettest men. And by this mean as I trow
/ that Sely wymmen should rather desire the help of friendship than men / And
also they that were nedy / rather than they / that were / rich / and they that
were wretchid / than they that were weleful / O lord what this is a noble
wisdom / fforsothe they are about to take the son out of the firmament /
that would take friendship / fro the life of man / Sith we have nothing granted
unto us of god in this life bettir or more Joyous / What is this quyetenes of
spirit / that they speken of. At the first sight it is blau^dysshyng / but in
very deed in many times and many places / it is utterly to be set a side. Ne
it is not according / that there should be any worshipful thing or deed that ye
could take upon you / or when ye had it / to set it a side without care and
labor of the mind / ffor if we will flee care / we must flee virtue / ffor
virtue must need have some care to set aside thyngis contrary to him / as
bounte to set a side malice / Attemperaunce lust / and force sluggisshnes /
And that is the cause / that we see that they that be right wys. ben moest sorry
for the things / which be done vnrihtwisly / And they that been strong for
things done vnlustely. And they that been atte^perat for things done vicyously
/ And therefore it is very propre to him. that has a well disposed courage / to
be glad when he sees things well done / And to be sorry for the contrary.
Then thus / if a wiseman may be sorry. the which must be needs true / or
less than we will trow / that there is no curtosye in any wise man's breast
/ what is the cause that we should set a side friendship so that we should
suffer no pain ne disease therefore. if that we take fro man the moeuyng of his
thoughtys / we shall not only take away the difference that is between him and
a be. but therewith the difference that is between him and a stock or a
stone / or any like thing. Ne they should not be herd that say / that virtue is
hard and as it were made of iron / ffor as it is in many other things / and in
especial in friendship / it is both tender and tretable / So that for the well
of a man's friend one enjoys / and for his aduersite he soroweth / Therefore
this pain that is to be taken for our feendes / suffyseth not to dysseuere
friendship for the life of man / no more than virtues. ffor that they can not be
had without labor and pain. should be by all men refused / And sythen virtue
sometime makes frendshyp to keep her within her self as I said before / if there
be any tokene of virtue the which may appear / to the which the courage may
apply And in him self. as soon as euir he atteyneth unto it / it must nedys be
that love thereof spring and grow / what may be more foul. than the delight in
many vain things / as in honor. and glory. in byldyng / in clothing / and
in the array of the body / and not to delight in courage enriched with virtue.
which may love. and may be reclaymed to live virtuously / There is nothing more
plesaunt / than the reward for good will. or the nyghnes of studyes / and
seruysablenes / And if we add this to that. which may right well be added.
that is to say / that there is nothing that draws any thing unto it / ne that
holds it faster / than lyklynes draws friendship. It shall be granted
forsothe as for troth / that they which ben good / love good folks / and
join them unto them / as if they knytte unto them in kynrede and nature /
fforsothe there is nothing more desirous of his like and semblable. or more
cacchyng than is nature Therefore Faunyus and Seuola. I trow verily. that this
is certain / that emonge them that been good / there is a manner of necessary
benyuolence. the which is a very naturel weel of friendship / but this same
bounte bylongeth also to the multitude of the people / ffor virtue is neither
vncurtoyse ne rewardlees / ne proud / which is wont alwey. in the best wise
to counsel and to defend all manner of paple / And that / vert^ should not
do / if she estraunged her self fro the love of the comunyte / Also me semeth^
that they which will form friendship / after the shappe of prouffyt / they
ben about to take a way the most amyable knotte of friendship / ffor the
prouffyt that is gotten by a man's friend. is not so delectable unto him. as
the love of his friend / ffor then that. which comes of his friend is
Joyous unto him. when he knows that it comyth of love / And as greatly me
thinks discordyng with reason / that friendship should only be used for
prouffyt. as that they which habounde in all richesse and power / and in
especial in virtue / in which is grettest sikernesse / And they I say which
have lest need of any man's help. should be most liberal / and gladdest to
do good deeds / And als far as I know / there lacked nothing emonge friends
/ ffor aftir that the love of friendship grew between me and Scipio / though he
had had no need of my cou^seile or my help. either outeward or at home / yet
the frendshippis should not have been the less / ffor this I say you / that
friendship follows not prouffyte. but prouffyte follows friendship / but tho
men ben not to hard which follow in delytes / when that they will speak of
friendship. of the which / they have neither use ne knowleche / ffor who is
that. that neither coueiteth ne loves any other man. ne is byloued of any
other man / though he had habondaunce of all other things / and were set in
most folsom plente / how should he live in this life that I spak of. is there
such life in tirau^tes / in whom is no faith ne love / ne there may be in them
the stablenesse of benyuolence. or any trust / ffor they have every thing
suspecte. and ben full of thought and care / There is nothing ne no place in
them for frendhsip Neuirtheles they be worshippid for the time and dissymyled
with all / ffor who should love him / that is dradde of all men / and dredeth
all men him self / And if it fortune as it happeth often. that they fall from
their astate. then it is well vndirstande. how great need they have of
friendship. As it is remembrid that Tarquynus said. wehan he was in his exile /
that he vndirstode not / whom he might trust. ne whom he might mystruste / And
therefore he might thenke all men like. Though the pride of this Tarquynus and
his inportunyte caused him / that he had no friend / ne men of his manners might
have no friends / for richesse and power of them that be greatly mighty /
exclude trusty frendshippes / ffor fortune her self is not only blind / which
draws to her such as be her seruauntis and clymbe up to estate with
lothnesse and contumacye of all people. And there is no thing more
intolerable. than a infortunat fool / and that may sone be seen / by them
that have been passing rich that when they have be set / in high estate.
power and dygnyte. their conditions have been clean changed / And they have
forsaken their old friends / and taken them to new / What may be a more
fonnysh^ thing than when men have great plente of richesse / to pourueye such
things as they do / that is to say money / horses / stately housholdes /
rich clothyng / precious plate / and forgete to pourueye them of friends /
which is best and the fairest ornament / that any man may have in this life.
ffor when they pourueye. of the said things that I spak of before They wot
not / ffor whoos use they pourueye. ne for whoos sake they take that labor
upon them. ffor all such things fall for the more party in to their hands
that be most mighty / But the possessions of friendship abide certain and
stable to every man / And though the goods of fortune abide with a man during
his life / without friendship his life may neither be fruytfull ne merry. And this
suffyseth as hyderto:

rEason would now that we putt thendes and bounds of friendship. like as they
were the terms and bounds of love. of the which I have vndirstonde three
opynyons / And of them I approve neuir one / One is that we should love our
friend als affectuously as our self / Another that our benyuolence against our
friends. may answer euenly to the benyuolence / which they bear against us /
The third. that who someuer / one makes much of him self / so much he should
be made of. by his frendys. And I can not agree / with none. of thise three
opynyons / ne the first of them is true. ffor there be many things which we
will. not do for our self / that we do for our friends / That is to say
pray him lowly that is byneth us / or to speak sharply or to blame him greatly
/ the which things be not honest in our owen causes / and ben most honest in
the causes of our friends / There be also many things / in which well disposed
persons take awey much of their owen prouffytes. And suffer to be taken away.
ffor that their friends should use them to their playfyre / rather than them
self / That other opinion is. which diffyneth friendship by parilite of duete
and playser. And forsothe that is to skante. to call his friend so wyckedly to
a count / that the reason of that / which is to taken / and that which is to
yeuen be even. but very friendship as it seems me / it is rather and more
plentyuouse / ffor that takes not so streyte heed / that there be given no more
than taken / Ne that fereth not to greatly / lest that any thing excede / and
fall beside / or that year be yeuen to a friend / no more than is nedeful and
even / The third term or end that they set is worst of all / And that is
how much a man makes of him self. so much he should be made of^ by his friend
/ ffor often it happeth / that some persons / have not so noble and so hye
courage as some have / ne that have not so ferme hope of thencrece of fortune^
as some have / therefore it sittith not a friend to be such one / against an other
man as he is against him self. But rather to pain him self / and to do so /
that he may lift up the low courage of his friend. and may bring him better
hope and more quycke remembrance. But we must lymyte an other end to
friendship / But first I shall tell you. what Scipio was wont most to repreue /
he seide. there might in no wise be thought more full of enemyte than the wis of
him. which said that a man should love in such wise / as^ if it happeth him
sometime to hate in the same place / ne he could not believe that Byas should
say so. which was so wise hold and one of the seven wise / how be it that men
trowed so / but that rather / it should be the saying of somother Impure and
ambycious person / or of such one / that would have called all thing to his
power / ffor in what wise should one be friend unto him / whom he has in a
wait / And troweth alwey he should be his enemy / ffurthermore it should be
necessary to such a man / to coueyte and desire / to take his friend often
with defawtes / that he may have gretter cause to chyde him / And beside that^
it must needs follow / that they should often take displesau^tly / and sorrow and
envy / when their friend does well And is in his well / Therefore that precept
Who so ever gaf it / was good to set friendship a side. he should have rather
have commanded that we should have put to our dilygences / to have gotten many
friends lest we should happen. to love some one / Whom we should hate soon
aftir. And Scipio thought that if we were not all therm ost happy unto friends
/ We should rather suffer it patiently. than think upon the time / When we
should be their enemies / Therefore I trow we should use / and take this for the
lymytes and bounds of friendship / that when the manners of our friends ben
good. that we should comune then with them. all our counseills things and
pleasirs without any excepcion. that if it shall hap by any fortune. that
their pleasirs. which ben not all the most / leefful / And in them the
peril of worship and fame depends / It is then for a friend / to keep him
self absente / if that he see that his great shame should follow thereof / ffor
though the error of a man may be pardonned in that / that he does for his
friend / yet a man's own fame should neuir be foryeten. The benyuolence of
people must needs be trowed a great help / for the speed of promocyon of
things / And yet to get the same benyuolence / by mean of flaterye and
assentacyon. is right foul and shameful / virtue of which is but a few / is
not to be set a side / But now I turn again to Scipio. whose speech in
substance was all of friendship / ffor he complained greatly. that men were
much more dilygente / in all manner of things than in chesyng of friends.
ffor every man could tell / How many sheep. and how many gheet he had / But
how many friends they had. they could not tell / And to get to them great
plente of bestaylle / they took great labor and pain. but in getyng of
friends. they showed them / slow and neclygente And before that they should bye
their beestys / they had certain marks / to know whether they were good or
no / But in chesyng of friends / they can not take such marks to know /
which be to trust and chose. and which not / Nevertheless late us say /
that they which be stable ferme and constaunt ben to be chosen for friends /
Of which manner of people / there is great scarcete / And certain it is right
hard for any man. on less he be expert. to discern well in such chesynges /
ffor a man must take experyence / in the sel^f time of frendshippe. and that
is passing hard / ffor friendship suffers no such essaye / it belongs
therefore a wiseman to suffer the force of benyuolence / such as he should use /
as he suffers his ship to saylle / And assaye the man^rs of his friends in
manner as he that essayeth his ship in a tempest. Sum ben soon espied in
lytil habondaunce / how light they be / And some that will not be meuid in lytil
things ben known in gretter / It may happen some men to be founden. that will
deem it a foul thing to set more by money / than by friendship / But where
shall we find them. which will not set more by worship / governance /
souerayntes / power / and habondaunce of goods. than by friendship / So that if
this thing forsaid were set on that one side. of a man / And friendship in
that other side / that would not chese rather worshippes / gouernaunces / etc.
than such friendship / ffor sothe nature is to weack to flee the desire of
power and worship / and though men sometime foryete friendship to atteyne to a
gretter auctoryte / they trow them self in that byhalue to find a good
excuse. while that they may say / that they foryete not friendship. but for a
great and a worthy cause / Therefore no doubt of. it is passing hard to find
verry friendship / in them which ben conuersau^t in hye courts / or in
thastate publyque / ffor where may we find him. that will rather put his
friend to worship than him self / and to set aside all such things. how
grievous and how hard it is seemed to many to enter frendshipe with them which
be in aduersyte / Ennyus said truly. when he said / a certain friend is
known in uncertain seasons / But there ben two things which prove in many men
lyghtnes / and vnsurenesse. and that is when they despise their friend for
prosperyte / or forsake him in aduersyte / Therefore who so euir can in either of
tho two things show him self witty stable and constant in friendship. we may
Judge him of that kynrede of men. which is most seldom found / I had almost
said that he is comen of gods / ffeyth is foundement or sikernesse of the
stablenesse and constau^ce that we seken in friendship / ffor there is nothing
stable. that is feythles / It is then convenient to chese a friend such as is
not double. and then take prosperity and aduersite in comune with him that
cheseth him. and can co^sente with him in living. and that can be meuid to like
thyngis as he is meuid for a crooked and a variau^t wit may neuir be feithful
/ ne he which is meuid to do such things / as his friend is meuid to do / or
has a like disposicion in nature. may either be siker or stable / And we may
add to this / that a friend / should not delight in complayntes to be brought
unto him. or give credence to such as be brought unto him / All the which
things apperceyue to that constaunce that I spak of right now / And so it is
true that I said in the beginning How friendship may not be. but bytweyne
such as ben good. It sits a good man / whom we may call a wise man to keep
two things in friendship / the first thing is that there is nothing feyned ne
dissymiled. ffor it sits rather a worshipful person rather to show his
displaysaunce and hate openly / than to hyde it with a sleyght look / The
second is that a man should not only set a side such complayntes as be
brought to him of his friend but therewith set a side all such suspecion as he
might have of his friend. by the which he should mow trow. that friendship
were hurt or defoylled Also there had need to be / between friends a manner of
swetnesse of speech and manners / the which thing makes friendship not a lytil
the more sauery / ffor sorrow and seueryte ben in all wyses to be eschewed in
friendship. Sorrow has greuosnesse Joined with him / And friendship should be the
more remysse / more free. and swetter / and more ready to all benygnyte and
facilyte of manners / but now in this place there is a lytil hard question /
Whether that new friends / And such as be worthy the name of friendship / be /
to be proferryd a man's old friends. As we are not wont rather to chese
coltes / than horses of seven year for our rode / but there should no man doubt
in this ffor there is not such fulsomnesse in friendship. as there is in other
things / ffor friendship fares as wine / which may be kept many years / ffor
the more foylles / that the wine is of. the more plesaunt it is in drynkyng /
And sothe it is that is said. how men may ete many busshellis of salt. or they
parfyte or accomplysshe their dutee of friendship. The noueltees of friendship
should not be forsaken / if that they be such / as a man may hope well of.
no more than new herbs / which deceive not men of such fruit as they shall
bring forth / But thantyquyte of friendship should be kept alwey in his own
place. ffor the force of Antyquyte and customme is alwey grettest / if no
thing let it / as I made mention right now of the horse / ffor there is no
man. but had lever ride upon an horse that is broken. And knows his hond on
the bridle / than upon that / which is not broken. or on whoos bak he came
neuir before / So customme has great strength not only in beestys. But also
in things which have no feeling / ffor we delight us in holy places / And
such as ben set in woods / in which we have long dwellid / but the chief
thing / that is in friendship / When he that is in superyoryte lyketh to make
him self egall with his friends. oftyme / There ben certain excellences such
as Scipio had in our company / And yet he putt Philus and Rutilyus / And
Mummyus ever before him / And diverse other of his friends. which were of lower
estate. And he worshippid Quintus his oldest brother. Which was nothing like
him / As his better by reason of his age / And he coueyted to have all his
friends in gretter reverence and in more ample estate than him self In which
thing / every man follow Scipion so / if they have gotten the preemynence of
virtue / of nature / or fortune / they should depart it with their friends /
And comyne with them / that been next to them / As if they be born of low kynne
/ or if they have weak friends / they should either by mean of counseill / or
by mean of liberalyte encreace their hauours / as it is told in the fables /
how certain men were resceyued in to seruyse^ their birth and kynne unknown.
And at last it was founden. and they known for the sons of gods and kings
/ And yet keep and now their favor and good will to such shepherdes as yet
live. and had their faders deed many years passyd / the which thing is much
rather to be do / against such as have faders known and certain. The
grettest fruit of naturel virtue / and all excellence is then taken / When
it is youen and departed to them that be next in friendship and good will /
And they that been souerayns / in the nyghnesse of friendship and join good
will. should make them self egall with them. that been lower than they / so as
they that be bynethe theym^ have no cause to sorrow / that they be ouercomen by
their friends / in wisdom / fortune / or estate / Of the which for the more
part / many complain upon such things or obreyde their friends therewith /
And so much the rather / they think their friends so much more byholden to
them / that they may tell how studyously. how frendely and laboryously they
have done for them / In good truth it is an hateful manner of men / which
list often to obreyde their friends of such things as they do for them /
ffor he that receives such benefaytes should remember. and not he that gaf
them. Therefore they that are the soueraynes / owe to submytte them self in
frendsyip / and in manner exalte them / which ben lower than them self / But
there ben some that maken friendship right grievous. when they trow that men
set little by them. And that happeth not comunely. but in such as trow them
self that they should be lytil set by. And they should be eased of that
oppynyon. not only in words but in deed / we should yield unto every friend /
first als much as he might sustain and receive / whom we love and will help /
ffor we may not do unto our friends by our means over much ample worshippes.
As Scipio which might by his means make Publius Rutilius Consul / but he
might not make his brother Lucius so / And what if we might do so to any other
/ yet it is to be seen / whether he may well take it upon him / The Judgment of
friendship should alwey be had / when the wits of thaages of men ben in
grettest force. and most hole and syker. ffor it is not spedeful / that if any
childeren in the thendrenesse of their years have like courage and disposicion /
to pleyeng at tenyce or huntyng / that they have them in most nygh of
courage / and chief of favor which ben of semblable desires and studyes / or
by that reason nourices and Scolemaistres by reason of old seruyse must ask
benyuolence right largely / And they should not be forgoten / But there is manner
in the cherisshyng of them without comformyte of manners / ffor friendship may
not be stable. ffor the dyuersyte of manners causes the dyuersyte of loves /
ffor as symylytude joined frendshippes / so dissimylytude disseuerith them /
And it is for none other cause / that good men may neuir be friends with such
as be noughty / But for that / that there is als great a distaunce / or
difference between their manners and studyes Also it may be a good precept in
the law of friendship / that no man by a manner of his intemperate benyuolence
let the great well. that should grow to his friends / ffor if I shall turn
again to fables / Neptholonius might neuir have won Troy / if he would have
herd licomedes / in whoos house he was nourisshed / which labored with
shedyng of many teerys to have let his purpoos. ffor oftymes great things
happen casu^lly to make men depart fro their friends. And many chese for to
depart rather than they should be let of their purpoos / without hieryng of
their friends / lest if they herd them. they could not say nay to their
desires. And such a man who so euir he be / is of over freall / and over soft
a nature / And for that cause he is not very Just in friendship / But it is to
be considered in every thing / what we ask of our friend / And what we will
suffer to be asked of our self and assethed / There is also a certain calamyte
or obscurite full oftymes necessary in departing of frendshippis / But now
our speech is and shall fall from the famylyarytees of wise men to comune
frendlyhedes / The defawte of friends break out and show as well to them which
be joined to them in friendship / as to other folks in the disclaundre thereof
/ and redoundeth not only unto them. which have the same vices / But also to
them which be their friends. And such frendshippis should be eased lytyl and
lytyle by slacknesse of customme and familyaryte / And as I have herd Cato say
/ they should rather be unripped / than rent asondre / on less than such
wrong. as may not be suffered disseuere the said friendship. so that it should
be thought neither reasonable ne worshipfull^ ne that it might be other wise /
but that the said estraungyng and disionction must forthwith be made / But
take me now as I said a lytyle before / that I speak not now of the
frendshippes of wise men. but of the comune frendshippes / if there happen to be
a manner of change / in manners and studyes / as it happeth often. ffor such
debate as falls in the parts of our estate publyque it is to be taken head
of. Thise frendshippes only be not laid a part / but that great enemytees be
taken in hand and bygonne. And yet there is nothing forsothe more foul than
to make werre with him / with whom we have lived alwey before famylyarly / Ye
know well / how Scipio departed from the friendship of Quintus Pompeus for my
sake / And how he was estraunged from his felawe named Methellus / for such
debate as was in our estate publyque / And he did in both things wittyly /
And by no sharp auctorite or offencion of his courage propre / But herfore I
say / we should take great head. that there fall no debates emonge our
friends / And if there happen any such things / we should labor that friendship
should rather be softly quenchid than oppressyd / we should in all wise beware.
lest great frendshippes torn them self in to great enemytees / of the which
/ debates / cursed words and stryues enfiewe. Neuirtheles if they be
tolerable / they must be suffered / And we should give this worship to old
friendship. that he be thought rather in the blame that does the wrong / than
he that suffers it / There is one prouysyon and one mean to beware of all
such vices. and incommodytees. And that is that we be not to hasty in the
setting of our love / ne that we love such / as be not worthy to be loved /
They ben worthy friendship in whom there be worshipful causes / which should
make us to love them. but they be selde founden / And so be all things which
be worshipful. And there is nothing more hard to find than that / which is
parfyt in his owen kind / in every behalue. But for the more part / men list
to call nothing good in humayne things / but such as is fruytfull / And so
they love their frendes^ as they love their beestys ffor such as they suppose /
they shall have most fruit of. them they cherysshe most / And therefore they
lack the most naturell and fairest friendship / which is not to be desired /
but by hit self / and for hit self / This is the verry force of friendship / and
the qualite / and the quantite of the same every man loves him self / and
looks aftir no reward for his love / ffor every man for his owen sake is dear
enough to him self / And unless that the said and the same dernesse and love
may be used in friendship a verray friend shall neuir be found / ffor he is as
though it were another than the same / And if that appears in beestys and
fowls bredyng in the woods. or in the waters tame or wild. that first they
love them self / ffor that is a thing. that is innate unto eueriche that has
life Secundly that they seek and desire such beestys as they would couple them
self with. and be of the same kind / And that they do with great desire. and
with a manner of likeness of the love of men. how much more it is caused by
nature in a man. that he should love him self / and get him another / whose
will he should meddle with his / that of tho tweyne he should make well nygh one /
But many men full cursedly / I will not say unshamefastly / refuse to have such
a friend / ffor they can not be such one them self. And they desire of their
friends such things / as they would not depart with them self / at their
friends desire / It is reasonable that a man first make him self a good man. and
then seek another like him self / And in such tweyne that stablenesse of
friendship that we trete of before may be confermed / when men joined to gydre
in benyuolence can get the soueraynte of such lusts / as other men be
servants unto / and set their joy in equity and Justice / Then that one
shall have of that other / but that / which is rightuous and worshipful / ne
they shall not only either of them worship other. but therewith they shall love
to gyders with a manner of shamefastness / ffor who so euir takyth away
shamefastness from friendship / takes awey the grettest ornament that
friendship has / Therefore there is great and malycious error in them / which
trow surely that friendship yeueth fredom and lyberte to all lust And syn
sith friendship is ordained by nature to be the helper of virtue / and not the
felawe to vice / ffor solytary virtue may not it self atteyne to such things
as ben highest. but joined and felawshipped with other. it might atteyne. the
which felauship if it be / have been / or shall be between any men / that
felauship is to be holden and reputed best / and most blessed to bring them
to the highest we will of nature / In this I say is the felauship / in which
all things ben / which men could suppose should be desired And that is worship
/ glory / and thease of spirit and Ioyousnesse / And where thise things be /
the life is blessed / And without them it ne may be blessed. Then sith that
it is best and most chief / if we will atteyne there unto / We must give
ourself to virtue / without the which we may neither come by friendship ne no
thing / that should be of us desired / ffor virtue set a side / who some ever
troweth that he has friends. he shall then know first how he is deceived /
when he is constrained to assaye adverse fortune / Therefore we may say. when ye
have preued. then love / And not when ye have loved. then to preue But sith
we be punysshed for our neclygence in many things / yet we be chiefly
punysshed for the neclygence of the worshippyng and loving of our friends in
our aduyses taking / we use a contrary order / ffor though we be entriked by
one mean / or by another / either by long famylyaryte / or with
thadmynystracion of our dutees / yet we break suddenly / in the mids of our
frendshippis / some time for lytil offense. And so great a neclygence in that
thing / that is most necessary / is gretely to be dispraysed / Friendship
forsothe is the thing to be set allone in thastate of man. and thutilite of
commodyte. whereof all men ben of one oppinnyon / though the same virtue be
despised of many which call it. but a thing set to sale and ostentacion
There be many that despise richesse And they ben such as hold them content
with lytil. And delight them in pour food and pour arraye / And some despise
worship. by the desire of which / many men ben set / a fire / And such men
trow as despise it / that there is nothing more waueryng ne more unstable than
the same / And so it happeth in other things many men set no prys by that /
that other men make most of / But all men acorde in thoppinyon of friendship /
ffor they that yeuen them self to thastate publyque / or they that delight them
in the knowleche and doctrine of many things. And they that been besyly ocupyed
about their own erandes / And if I shall join them to the remenau^t / they
that yeuen them self all to lusts and delytes / trow and feel that there is
no life without friendship / namely if they will live in any part lyberally and
Ioyously / Friendship crepith I woote not how in to the lives of all men / And
it suffers none age be partelees of him / but if so be that any be of sharp or
cruel entente and nature. that he flee and hates the metyng and felawship of
men / so as one did at Athenes a namelees man almoost. sauf that he hight
Thymo / yet he might not suffer / but that he must have one to disclose unto.
the horribylyte of his sharp life. And this might be best proved / if it might
happen / that god wol^de take us from the conversation of men. and set us
somwhere in wilderness / And there give us habundance and plente / of all
thing that nature could desire. And therewith take from us the sight and use of
all men. who could be found so hard that could endure that life / or fro
whom that being allone should not take the fruit of all plesaunce / Therefore
it is full true that Tarentinus Archita was wont to say / the which our
olders were wont to tell us / as they herd tell of their olders. if any man
had ascended in to heaven. and beholden the nature of the world And the beauty
of the sterres. that which he had seen of merueyle. should be in no wise
plesaunt to him / if he had none / to whom he might disclose that he had seen /
the which thing else / that is to say. if he had a friend to whom he might
disclose it / that should be to him the thing of most sovereign plesaunce^ So
nature loves nothing that is solytary^ ffor it leneth alwey to some one thing
that it will rest upon / And where can it more surely rest / than in that
thing. which is most frendely to it / But when nature declares by so many
signs / what she would have / what she seeks / and what she desires / we wexe
deef / I woote not how / for we will not here / when she aduertyseth us. The use
of friendship is diverse and manyfolde and so there be many causes of suspecion
and displesaunce the which to eschew / to ease / and to bear / is a wise
man's part / But there is one manner of displesaunce / that should be patiently
born / And that is when one friend for the proffyte and feyth which should be
retained in friendship suffers a maulgre. ffor friends should often be warned
and blamed resonably / And such warnynges and blamynges should be taken
benyuolently and frendely. But I wot not how it is true / that Terence says
in his comedye named Andria / following of playsyr geteth friends / And truth
hate. Truth is grievous / for of it comes hate / which is the poison of
friendship / but following of playsyre. is much more grievous. which suffers
sin vnblamed / and makes a man's friend run hedlynges in to myschief /
But the grettest fault that may be in a man / is to despise truth / and to
be by following of playsire wilfully led in to deceyte^ Therefore diligence and
reason is to be had in this byhalue. ffirst that our advertisement to our
friend be not sour / And next that / blaming be without chydyng / And let
us use benygnyte in following of playsyr / That word I use gladly / sith Terence
vsid the same / But before all thing / let us flee assentacion in friendship /
which is the promoter of vice / the which not only a friend. but every good
man should eschew it / It is not all one to live with a tiraunt and to live
with a friend / but close his eeres / when it is spoken / his heal is to be
dispraysed / Of the saying of Cato is well known. how sharp enemies / merit
much more of some men / than such as semen their sweet friends / ffor the
first say for the more part truth / And that other neuir^ And that is a
foul thing that they which be amonesshyd by their friends / take not such
displesaunce / as they should take / but take such displesau^ce as they should
lack / ffor it greueth them not / that they have synned^ but it greueth them
greatly to be blamed for it / And it should be all other wise / ffor they should
sorrow for their offense / and be glad to to corrected / It is verray propre to
friendship / to warn and to be warned / and he that is the warner should warn
benygnely / curtaysly / and not sharply / And he that is warned / should take it
pacyently and not obstynatly / Thus we should hold / that there is not a gretter
sore in friendship. than adulacion. flatery / and assentacion^ loo how many
names this vice has. hit sytteth to such men / as ben light and deceyuable /
to say all thing acordyng to playsyr^ and nothing to truth / sith the
dyssymylyng in all thing is vicious. ffor it takes away and corrupts the
Judgment of truth / yet in especial it is vicious / for that it is so
contrary to very friendship / ffor it sets a side truth / without the
which. friendship may be of no valewe. ffor sith the force of friendship rests
in that / that one will should be made of many wylles / how may it be so made
/ if one will be not in one man. ne yet the same alwey / but variaunt.
manyfolde^ and meuable / what thing may be so flexible or so ready to bow / as
the will of him that is ready to change / not only by the felyng and the will
of another man^ but also at his chere and contenau^ce / Some men will deny
this. well I deny it / he says so / I say the same / but what says he. I
have maystred so my self / that I will assente in all things / as the same
Terence says / but I speak this in the person of Enato / but to entende to
this manner of friendship. hit becomes best such as be light / There be many like
Enato / when they be in place of fortune and fame above other / but their
assentacion is to grievous / namely when auctorite is joined to vanyte / but a
flateryng friend / may as well be known and understood from a true friend /
if a man put to due dilygence / as all things which be colored and
dyssymiled may be known fro such as be pure and very in that cou^seill that
rested of leest wise men / one may soon put difference between him that is a
flaterer / and a light cytezeyn / and him that is constau^t sad and wytty /
with what flatery entryd Cueyus papirius in to the eeres of our counsel /
when he brought in the law to renouell the trybunes of the people / but we
advertised the contrary / of my self I will not speak / but of Scipio with a
good will / O almighty god how great wit / and how great mageste was in his
oracion / that men should rather take him for a prince / than for a fellow of
the people of rome / but ye were present / and his oraco^n is in your hondes /
so that law / that should have be made for the favor of the people / by the
suffrages of the same people was putt a back / but now to torn again / where
I was ye be well remembered / But Quintiuus maximus brother to Scipio / and
Lucius Manilius being co^suls. how gretely plesau^t was seemed in the law made
by Cueius lucinius Cressus entitled de Sacerdocijs to the people / wherein the
reformacion of the collegis was brought to the benefayte of the people / And he
ordeygned first to have to do in his cause with the people in the open place /
and yet the relygion of the gods Inmortall my self defendyng it. ouercam
lightly his vendyble oracion / and that was done by me whiles I was praetor / so
that cause was rather defended for the Justness of it / than by any hye
auctoryte. Then if so be that in that place. Where that our tragedyes ben
played / Where that countrefete and colored things have great place. that it
which is next the truth is most praised. if it be showed and represented as
it should be / what trow ye then should be done in friendship. which is all
apperceyued by truth / by the which friendship / unless than ye show your
breast opene and bare to you agayn^ there may nothing be syker and sure between
you / Ne ye may not love verily / ne be loved verily again / and if ye
understand not verily / how this is true take ye head. ffor though
assentacion of flatery be in it self cursed / yet it hurts no man / unless
than he wilfully receive it. and deliteth him in it. and so it is that he that
flaterith him self. is most redyest to hyere flaterye / and has grettest
playsyr in him self / but virtue loves alwey her self best / and how amyable
she is / But I speak not now of virtue it self / but of thoppynyon that is had
of virtue ffor many there be / that set not so much by virtue it self. as that
they may be seemed virtuous / and flaterye plesyth such men gretely / And when
feyned words ben applied to their playsyrs / they trow that such feyned
speches ben sufficient witness of their preysynges / Therefore between them is
no friendship / when that one will not here truth. and that other is ready to
believe the merry flaterye of the smylyng feestes in our comodyes / which will
not do half well / unless then that there were glorious knygthes. when one
asked. if his sovereign could him great thank / he answerith. ye passing great
thank where it should suffice to answer / thank / so the flaterer euir
encreaceth that thing / that he would have encreced for whose playsir he says
it / therefore though this sweet vanyte be of great force to bid and draw to
such folks as have playsyr in hit / Neuirtheles they which be more wytty and
more con / staunt should be advertised / that they have them self in a wait /
that they ne be taken by such wyly assentacion / There is no man. but he sees
openly a flaterer on less than he be a fool / or wytlees / but let us
beware: lest he be subtle and by fer set means set upon us / And then
he is not passing easy to be known / ffor sometime he will trauersse a man's
will / and finally assente and make* as though he did strive. And yet he
flatereth / And at last he will give up his cause / and suffer him self to
be overthrow / to that entente. that he which is mocked / may seem him self
more valiant / but what may be fowler / than to be mocked / Therefore we ought
to be the better ware / that it happen not un to us. There was one said / I
would ye had seen me this day before al my friends / And before all such as
love me / men of great worship and age And how plenteuously I live emonge them
/ but it farith by this man. as it is said in the fables / The most fonnysshe
persons represente such aged men / as lack for sight / and ben hasty of
credence / but I wot not by what mean / our spech^ is fallen from the
frendshippes of such men as ben parfyght. that is to say wise / I speak of
that wisdom / that men may atteyne to light frendshippes / Therefore let us
turn again. to the first friendship we speak of and conclude therein. I say
Eneius Faunyus / and Quintus Mucius. it is the chief virtue which geteth
frendshippes / and co^cerueth them / ffor in virtue is the co^uenyence of
things / the stablenes and constau^ce. and when she exalts and shows her
owen light / and when she sees and knows the same in another / she draws
it stoundmele unto her. and takes so the same / that is in another / Whereof
love and friendship of such knyttynges of good willis is set on fire / ffor
both Amor and Amicicia ben deryuyed of Amando / And what is to love / any else
/ but for to love such as have none Indygence. no sekyng of prouffyt. though
it flourysshe and flower / it causes the to love him of such friendship. Also
it is caused thaugh ye easily follow it / that we young men have loved thise
men which were right aged / Lucius Paulus / Marcus Cato Cueius Gallus. Publius
Nassica. Titus Graccus fader in law to our Scipio / but friendship shows most
bright. when it is emonges them / which ben of egall years / as between me and
Scipio / Lucius Fucius Publius Rutilius and Spurius Mumius Some while we aged
men rest in the benyuolence of them / which ben toward the world. as it
fares by me / which delight in the famylyaryte of Quintus Tubero. which is as
who says young / And Publius Rutilius / ffor it is acordyng to the reason of
our nature and life / that one age succeed another / but we should naturelly
most desire that we might come alwey. at the heels of them / that we were
let out with to roue first / but sith the things of men ben freal and falling
/ we should pain us / to get some such / as we might love truly / And of
whom we might be also trewly beloved men / ffor when love and benyuolence ben
taken aweye from our life / all gladness and comfort goth with the same / ffor
Scipio though he were suddenly take awey fro me / as to me ward he lives. and
euir shall live / ffor I loved the virtue of that man / which can not be
extynct. ne I have not only that virtue. alwey in my sight. which I have
found alwey ready at my hand / but therewith the same is left notable and clear
to them that shall come aftir me / ffor there shall neuir man take upon him so
great things / but that he shall mow trow / that the remembrance and Image
of Scipio / ought to be called to his mind / Therefore of all things / which
fortune or nature has granted me / I / have nothing that I may compare with
the friendship of Scipio / ffor in that friendship I fond the comfort of our
estate publyque / and in the same I fond alwey cou^seil ready for such things
as bilonged to my self And in that same I fond rest / full of all
delectacyon And I neuir offendyd him in so lytil a thing as could be ymagyned
als far as I could feel / Ne I herd neuir thing of him / that I would not
have herd. We dwelled in one hows. Our manner of living was all one / In time
of werre we were to gydres / In talkyng of our disportes and pylgremages doing
we neuir disseuered / And what shall I say of our studyes / the which we used
to know or to learn alwey somewhat. and in the which / when we were fro the
sight of the people. we spente all our void times / And if the remembrance and
hye memory had dyed with him / I might in no wise bear the absence of him. to
whom I was most nygh knytte / and he of me best byloued / but these things be
not deed / but rather norysshed and encreaced by the thought and remembrance
that I have of him. and though all tho things were take away fro me / yet mine
age does me great comfort / I may not now long live in this desire. All
short things / though they be great / they should be tolerable / Thise
things I have had which I might say unto you of friendship. Now I exhort you
/ that ye so set virtue / without the which / friendship may not be / that
except the same ye deem that nothing may be better than friendship.

Thus ends this book named Tullius de Amicicia / which treats of friendship
vtterid and declared by a noble senator of Rome named Lelyus unto his two
sons in law also noble men of rome named Faunyus and Seuola. In which they
desired him to inform them of the friendship / that was between the said Lelius
and the noble prince Scipio Affrican. wherein he has answered and told to them
the noble virtues that been in friendship And without virtue very friendship may
not be. as he preuyth by many exsamples and notable conclusions as here to fore
is much plainly expressyd and said all a long / which work was translated by
the virtuous and noble lord and Earl / therle of worcestre. on whoos soul I
bechese almighty god to have mercy / And All ye that shall read or here this
said work of your charity I beseech you to pray for him. And by cause this
said book de Amicicia is full necessary and requysyte to be had and known. I
have putt it in emprynte / to thentent / that very Amyte and friendship may be
had as it ought to be in every estate and degree / And virtue without which
friendship may not be had^ may be encreaced* and vices eschewid^ Then when I
had enprynted the book of old age / which the said Tullyus made / me seemed it
acordyng that this said book of friendship should follow / by cause / there can
not be annexed to old age a bettir thing / than good and very friendship.
which two said books here to fore wreton ben of great wisdom and auctoryte /
And full necessary bohoeffull and requysite unto every age estate and degree /
And that they prouffyte in encreacyng of virtue / I beseech the blessed Trynyte
to give and grant unto all them that shall read and here thise books / And so
to flee and eschew vices and sins / that by the merytes of virtuous honest
/ and good works / we may atteyne aftir this short / transytorye life the
eternal blessed life in heaven / where is joy and glory without end. Amen.
Here follows the Argument of the declamacyon / which labors to show.
wherein honor should rest:
When Thempyre of Rome most floured / And was in the age of his force and
strength. The fame of one named Fulgeus / was right far spredde to his great
worship. ffor he was right eurous to richesse / honor / and friendship / Also
greatly rich as well of the grace and good will of all the Cyteseyns of Rome /
as of other gifts of fortune / And he had by his wife named Claudea a daughter
of surmountyng beauty called and named Lucresse / which was thonly hope of his
comfort and sustentacion in the years of his age / fer beside her merueyllous
beauty. wherein she excelled all the vyrgyns of Rome in tho days / There was in
her so great attemperau^ce of life / with so worshipful conduyt of manners / so
great force of wisdom / with so plenteuous understanding of lectrure / that it
showed her to lack nothing / that could be wylled or wesshed any worshipful
creature to have of honor or virtue / Nevertheless among many that hertly
loved her. there were tweyne in especial. which daily more and more / brenned in
the love of fair Lucresse^ And between them was lytil difference in
semelynesse of persone^ or age. But their manners and fortune were gretely
different. The one of them and the first was named Publyus Cornelius / of the
worshipful hows and stock called Cornelij / And he habounded gretely in the
goods of fortune^ ffor though he was noble of birth Yet thereto he was gretely
stuffed of Richesse. well furnysshed of friends / his household plenteuously
garnysshed of servants / and all apparaylmentys in those days used / And his
great study rested in huntyng. haukyng syngyng / and disporte / That other and
the second which hyghte Gayus Flamyneus was born of a lower stock. And he
had moderate Richesse / reasonable plente of that / as apperteyned to an
household / or thapparaylyng of the same / how be it / he had much better and
more worshipful fortune / And that not withstondyng / he showed him self neuir
the more slack in that he should do / Paynyng him self alwey to flower in
virtue and good manners / but his great study was with his dilygence and
se^^yse. to help his friend and country / when either of them had need of his
help. In time of werre he showed him self manly and corageous / And in time of
peace right besye and laboryous in his books / so that in time of werre / he was
furnysshed of counseylle / And he counseylled nothing but such as him self
full like a man would take his part in / he excellyd gretely in attemperaunce
of living. prudence / and eloquence / above that. it was credyble / or could be
supposyd in any of his years / And of the said noble virtues / he was gretely
praised of all the people of Rome / Hit fortuned thise two young men. to mete
of adventure at the house of this Fulgeus / fader unto fair Lucresse / their
ententes and causes of coming like as it was proved by their ouerture / was
that either of them desired in as goodly langage as he could / the good will
and parfyght favor of Fulgeus. touching his daughter Lucresse / so as she
might owe her favor to him in especial before any other / Thus either of
them desired Lucresse / and her fader understanding their playsyrs went for
to have speech with his daughter / to thentente to give them answer. And when
he had declared to fair Lucresse the honorable desires of thise two lusty
young Romans / And considered well that his daughter was in the flour of her
years / he yaf to her his fadrely aduys^ that she should entende to marriage /
and set her heart upon one of thies tweyne. that is to say Publius Cornelius
or Gayus Flamyneus / And Lucresse first with a shamefast countenance. when she
herd her faders declaracyon and advise / excused her full humbly and womanly
showing her self to be all other wise set / But her fader charged her so
streytly / that her excuse in that byhalue. might take no place / Ne other
mean was none. but that she must chese one of thise tweyne. that is to wit
/ either Publius or Gayus / And then delyberaon taken with her self / this
was her fynal answer /

Thanswere of Lucresse unto her fader.
Right worshipful fader of me your humble daughter best byloued and most
drad. I dar in no wise disobeye your commandment yeuen unto me / on your
blessing / I pray you chese for me / and to your sone in law / the more
noble of both. upon the which her answer / there grew great contrauersye
between thies two young Romaynes^ and great heart brennyng / which of them
tweyne should have be counted for more noble / And for as much as like things
had not be seen before / And that thanswere of Lucresse was openly publysshed /
the matter was brought by fore the Senate / where either of them had such
langage for his part by way of Oracion as ensieweth /

The Oracion of Publius Cornelius Scipio.
Sith it is so that my lady. Lucresse has willed and desired to have the more
noble of us tweyne. Ye ffaders conscript / which of you is he. that
understands openly / how Publius Cornelius Scipio born and descended. of the
noble and worshipful blood and house of the Cornelyes. must by all reason and
right. have and enjoy the glory of this most goodly choice. who is he well
aduysed that doubted that / to be noblesse / which we take of the stock / of
our worthy olders / sith they left that / unto their heirs and successours^
as the richest part of their enherytaunce / ffor when they have atteyned the
fame of worshipful deeds / by them parfyghted. and deserved laud of knyghtly
disciplyne. ripe manners / great virtue / and high glory / and have meryted a
name bright and Inmortal / with hye and grettest worshippes. that they have
atteyned to the places and offices of grettest auctorite in our cytee / And so
called the very noblesse and worship by the remembrance of the which / all
their issue is nobled / if it so be that we bring our childeren in to this
world as part of our blood / members. bones / and bowellys. how should they be
otherwise called than the parts of our body / the which granted / hit must
follow necessarily that their heirs / parts of their body / be parteners of
their glory / And such part of glory as they receive / they leave unto their
childeren / as to the parties of their body / And so to be continued to the
last of that kynrede. Sothe it is / that the likeness of the faders / be for
the more part showed in the childeren. by thordenaunce and establysshement of
nature / And sometime they be verily like. that nothing in beauty and
personnages can be found differente. And so that during the life of the sone /
the fader may not be foryeten / Item many faders and childeren ben so like in
manners / that their wits and manner of living be well nyghe comformable / the
childeren be so norysshed and brought up in their faders houses / the which
their famylyer custommes. and daily conversation of speech / and delynge to
gydre. must needs draw them to comformyte of manners / sith it draws them
which be foreynes full often unto the same / By the which reasons / it shows
euydently / that custom and nature. have full great force and strength in
childeren / and inpressyng in them full hugely his force / So that for the more
part if the fader and mother be vycious / they leave alwey a spotte unto all
their progenye / And if they be virtuous. they leave to them a bright fame.
such as without their demerytes. may not be taken from them. I could
remember unto you many if ye will not think me to long / which have had
worshipful faders / and therefore without any other cause / have been called
forthwith noble who is that well understands the worship of Furius Cammillus /
that would not Judge his childeren noble and honorable / sith he delyuerd the
cite in most extreme peril / out of the hondes of our enemies / And so he
allone repared and preserved the weal of our thing publyque / who is he also
in like wise / that will not think the childeren of Fabius Cato and Emilius
worthy fame and noblesse / sith by the virtue of their said faders. the cite
was set in so great worship and surete / And they therefore received so often
their tryumphys / who is he that will not trow / that our well publyque / is
gretely beholden to the childeren of them / which so often put them self
wilfully / their life / their goods / and all that they had in grettest
Ieoparde and peril for the same / ffor if their faders well and worshipfully
acquyted them self in that byhalue. And caused our cite to flower in so great
worshipp and glory / fforsothe me seems / it were over unkind if it would
not have them in perpetual and worshipful remembrance / And therefore in so
much as our olders would not ben hold but kind. they ordained and
establysshed by their statutes and laws publyque / that who someuir they were.
that chastysed their enemies destressed great folks / or subdewed contrees to
their obeyssaunce / should receive. at their return / that glory. that was
unto an Emperor with worshipful Tryumphis openly yeuen. by the which they
should be exalted in worship like unto a g^^de Inmortall / Graven images also
representyng their likeness should be set in the places / where thassemblee
of the people oftenest / and most amply was had. Also their names to their
perpetuel laud were written in the stone works enbowed / called the Arches
tryumphal. tappere clearly to all their heirs and successors. The which
Arches tryumphal / Romans vysyted and worshipped certain days of the year by
them lymyted and ordeygned / wherefore it should seem / if such and so great
worship was due unto the graven images / the same and gretter is due unto their
childeren and progenye. ffor tho graven images were but a counterfeted
representacion of their persons and victoryes / And in their childeren nature
has lyeffully enprynted and showed verily the same / and / so ordeygned / that
they may do great and good seruyse / to the weal publyque where as the deed
stones may full lytil ease or prouffyte / And their childeren calling unto their
mind the noble deeds of their progenytours. may be so set unto the following
of them / that they should mow do many things full weleful / and commodyous
for our estate publyque. And set a side many things noyesaunt and peryllous
for the same / And therefore full often / for the reward of their faders merytes /
our Cytezeyns have youen to them diverse offices of great auctorite and
worship Also more over / there is no wise man / that understands him self
nere his days and time of death. gives charge so gretely of any thing
erthely. as of that / that he shall mow leave his childeren to live worshipfully
aftir their disceas / Ne in their age they can not understand. any thing more
plesaunt or joyous unto them. than if there children by their virtues be called
to estate and worshipp we see also that the chief of their thought. and
pleasure is upon their childeren / And some think they can not age ne wexe
old / while their childeren ben a live / ne that they be vnforsaken by
humanyte. all the while / their childeren enioyen it / which premyses preue.
that the love of the faders / among all the desires of mortal men / can not be
thought to rest so gretely in any one thing. as in their childeren. and if it
so be that the pryncipal thought of the faders both first and last. rests
in the childeren. and in them / and for them they have their plesaunce / and
care / The sequel is upon this cite that they must think chiefly / it be
kept and holden to the childeren of them I mean of tho faders / which have so
meryted thank and laud. for that they have done for the same cite / And
furthirmore worshipe and make much of them / at the reverence of their faders
/ and to use and exercise that kyndenesse in them. wherein they fawted in
power to recompense the merytes to their said faders whiles they lived /
Therefore me seems / this is the highest part of noblesse. to come of their
auncestres. of whom they may recou^te and reherce the noble deeds / many times
worshipfully achieued and parfyghted truly and without color / And for their
benefaytes^ their issue may duly desire. And by title of enherytaunce challenge
the offices of estate and worship in this cite or any other place / And
remember them self. how they be very parties of tho bodies which have been so
worshipful. ^eryng the likeness / image / and prynte aftir them / Who is he
that would not Judge them noble / namely when all men ben of the same oppynyon
/ Parde the comyne people. call them only noble. which ben descended of
noble Auncestry. fferthermore sothe it is^ that the habundaunce of Richesse
embelyssheth gretely noblesse / by the which Richesse. the servants / and
all other conuenyentes. for the well beseeyng of the hows / ben had more
goodly and playsaunt / And such things also as outward possessions / And
foreyn causes ben better sustained and served. Friendship also and attendaunce
of neighbors / is by that mean purchased / And who is he that can think /
that he should mow well help his friends in time of their need / which may
not of him self releue his own necessyte. Wherefore me seems the chief and
highest part of noblesse / must rest in lyberalyte. And as I said he payneth
him self vaynely to exercise lyberalyte to other folks / which has not
whereof to use it to him self. It is necessary then / that he that will be
lyberall / habou^de in goods of fortune. then his noblesse shall show /
bright by mean of lyberalyte / And the lusty brightness of many noble persons
is derked and seaced when they lack that / whereof they should be lyberall^ How
many noble and chosen men have there ben / that when they have be brought to
the point of pouert / have been holden and taken for vile / And of none
estymacyon. how many hye and noble men have deyed unknown for lack of good /
whose virtue might not conduyte them to the favor of princes for that they
lacked that. which was necessary for sustentacion of their living. Then
habundaunce of good is a great and asouerayn help / to the show / and setting
out of the works of noblesse / by the which the courage may be enforced with
great hardynes. And the virtue of noblesse may more clearly appear. And if it
so be that noblesse rests in blood and richesse / as it must needs. which of
you is it faders conscript / that doubts my blood And my hauoyrs / remembryd
/ but that I should mow well challenge to be one of the most noble of this cite /
ffor who is he that has fought more manly. for our estate publyque / than mine
Auncestres / Or where may be found among us / that has putt him self in
gretter Ieoparde for the same than they / Or by gretter force and virtue has
set a side fro this cite peril and dishonor lykly to have fall to the
same / where can ye remember that any have subdued to your obeyssaunce so much
of this world as mine auncestres have done / ffor one of them when he had
chastysed the proud courages of the kings of Asie and diverse other nations.
deserved the name of Asie^ to be joined to his name for a perpetuel memory of
his victory / Another of them in the time when ytalye labored in the
suffraunce of the cruel force of our enemies. which neither spared to brenne
/ slay / and waste all the contrees enuyro^ne / I mean aftir the great
bataylle of Gueius delyuerd the cite all occupied with weeping / wayllyng. and
woo. despeyred of releef. by the puyssau^ce of Hanybal then our enemy /
considered with his daily victoryes / enchaced the said Hanybal from our
bonds of Italy / in to his own country. where he put him to perpetuel rebuke
/ And subdued the estately cite of Cartage. which had alwey us in hate / to our
obessau^ce / by the which victory / he meryted the name of Affryca to be
knytte with his name / And for so much as the thryd Scipio in the time of the
rebels of Cartage. when he had made the wallys and byldynges even with the
ground / The said name of Affryca. he and his successors enjoyed as a surname
where in they were enheryted / I pass over to speak of other. by whose virtue
and glory this Cite was soueraynly praised and dradd. ffor if I would reherce
you / the worshipful deeds and acts of euerych of mine auncestres / I should
peradventure occupye you to long / And I should not understand my self / when
I should make an end. And I may much more gladly and leeffully / in this
byhalue put my self to silence. sith that their famous deeds be to their
Infynyte lawde notayrely known of you all / ffor where is the place in this
Cite that is void / of the tryumphal writing of mine Auncestres / or where is
that temple / that is not enourned with the rich espoylle of their victoryes /
what sacred places can we see here / In which the pyctour or grauyng of their
images is not / And they be such / and as great reme^braunces of their
noblesse / as is leefful for any mortal man to will or desire / which premysses
preue euydently / in how great noblesse of blood I am enheryted / ffor I bear
in me the very image of them / ffor who so ever knew them / and now sees
me / may not faill to call them unto his mind / I am he that represe^ted
their blood their members / and their shappe in this body which I bear about /
Of them I came / In their howses I was nourysshed / and with them I dwelled
till I atteyned the years of my force / And so I am descended of the strene of
their noblesse / that in no wise it may be taken fro me / and if this cite be
dettour unto them / ffor their benefaytes. I must needs claim / as their
heyr / part of the same debt / And me seems I may challenge of you worshypful
faders of right. such offices of worship as shall fall in your yefte. ffor I
trow there were neuir none more worshipful endowed with noble courage than mine
auncestres / which unto me left as great plente of noblesse and richesse / as
can of any person be wylled or desired / ffor my fader left unto me fair and
stately places / well and plenteuously fornysshed of all manner things / which
should be long unto them / so that when they be arrayed and honged with such
stuff as he left me / there is full lytil difference. between the palayses of
kings / and my byldynges / I have then without the subarbes. places of
disporte as lustely and pleasauntly bylded^ as can be devised / beside that I
have in champayne^ ffertyle feldes. rich posseessions and fair vyllages /
which be able to receive. not only a great howshold. but a great host / And
furnysshe them haboundauntly of all manner of vitayll / What howshold I keep
and how it is beseen^ All the people of this cite know well enough / fforsothe
I have so great plente of the yeftys of fortune. And of my worshipful
progenytours. that I dare say / So that no man there with be displeased / that
there be few in this cite in birth and richesse / which excelle me. Then
let Gayus Flammyneus put him self to silence / And namely in this stryf of
noblesse / or in the desire of fair Lucresse / sith in birth and richesse he
may challenge no part of noblesse / Namely sith it is to us all unknown /
from whens he came. And whether he have any little pyece of earth to bylde upon a
Cote or lodge. And therefore of very right I ask this fair lady / which is to
be married / that has chosen me / sith I am more noble than Flammineus. And
therefore I have best deseruyd to be perpetual servant to her most beautyuous
grace / during my life / And ye my lady Lucresse have right great cause to be
right glad / and thank our gods hertely / which have endowed you with so
great wisdom and grace. ffor ye cowde not have chosen a more faithful. ne more
obeyssaunt servant ne one that loves you more hertely. ne one with whom ye
should pass your years more prosperously. ffor I shall bring you to my lodgyng
where ye shall see estately byldynges of halle and chambres convenient for a
king. Next ye shall see the chamber of playsaunce with rich and playsaunt
beds and hangynges. Also the rich pyeces of clothes of gold and sylke for
your arayement / And ye shall chese as much as shall please you of them / ye
shall not be vexid with common labors / ye shall led your life with pleasant
ydelnesse / And ye shall not need to break your sleep to think how ye shall
get you money to live at your lyberte. As it shall best please you. And ye
shall not need to think on any thing / but how ye shall be merry in syngyng
dau^synge / hunting / hawkyng / and such other disportes of pleasaunce / And
ye shall have such gentil wymmen / to be parteners of your playsyrs as ye will
chese / and other maidens which shall be ready to obey your commandments /
There shall no day pass you / that ye ne shall have some disporte of pleasaunce.
And I shall enforce me to make you pass the nyghtes meryly / And Flammineus
might evil promise you thise things. sith he is of such pouerte. that he
lacks all these him self. And with him forsothe ye should led over wretchid
and careful life / ffor instead of estately and playsaunt beds and hangynges
/ ye shall find in his hows such as they use upon land. / And instead of
playsaunt ydelnes ye shall find over peyneful business. Instead of rest /
labor / And instead of sleep. watch / And there should no day pass you
far / without labor and occupacion / who is he^ therefore that supposes /
but that fair Lucresse would have me to her servant / when she cheseth the
more noble of us tweyne / fforsothe Madame ye uneath speak more openly / In
this your wysest / and most discrete choys. unless that ye had named me by my
name / full womanly and covertly ye expressyd your desire / and where your
shamefast womanhed would not say / I desire Cornely / ye said / I desire the
more noble of them tweyne / It were over great a folly to deem otherwise /
ffor who is he that would believe / that ye would forsake playsa^t rest / and
chese peynful besines / therefore ye faders co^script acordyng unto your estates
and dygnytees / give ye a rightuous sentence in this matter /

Thus ends the Oracion of Cornelius Scipio
And here follows the oracion of Gayus Fla^mineus
wOrshipful ffaders conscript / sith I am enforced to speak for my part of
noblenes / me seems I have a very great grace to have you to my Iuges. which
be most noble / and endowed with most assured courage / There can nowher be
found any. which have so parfyght use of noblesse as ye And it is the thing
to my souerayn comfort and joy / when I remember you so full of equity and
right having so parfyght knowledge of things with a customed use of virtue.
Then I shall not mow suffer of you any wrong / or say any thing not known
to you / or remember any virtue / the which ye your self use not / In this
contrauersye fforsothe faders conscript / it is to give more sad and quyck
audyence^ than in any other pryuate stryues / ffor this is a Judgment that shall
concern only two cyteseyns. or one particular person. but it is a thing that
touches all folk / and shall ever be had in remembrance. And shall be named
thorugh all the world. theterne law of the sacred Senate of Rome / Ye may
see this day otherwise than it has been before time seen / how all the pepole
of Rome ben present / And lie in awayte upon your Judgment. And ye may
behold the sight and look of your Cytezeyns and foreynes cast and fyxed upon
you / And to them it is not only comfortable to understand / which of us
tweyne shall have fair Lucresse / but which of us should be Iuged for more noble
/ therefore I exhort your great wisdom to aduerte the weight of this matter /
ffor how be it / Justice is to be tendered and kept / in every matter / yet it
is most to be take heed of / and how to be used in high and great matters.
And faders conscript. I beseech you to pardone me for your great humanyte and
noblesse / though I speak more sharply in this matter / than I have been a
customed before this / to be mine own herawde / ne to say evil of any other
person without great cause / sith I know well / the first proceeds of an
Inmoderate courage / and the second of an inpacient heart / natheles I am
enforced to the first that is to say my self / sith I must needs defend mine
own nobles / and to the second / I am compellyd / by the surquydous boost and
wantoun langage of Cornely / which has spoken lately before you / lytil
worship of me. temptyng his softness with his sharp wordes^ And yet he gaf me
by that / great help and socoure in my cause / both to rebuke and to repress
his lack of shamefastness / ffaders conscript ye have understood the
playsyr of noble Lucresse / touching the choys of us tweyne. And how Cornelius
has be bold to descryue noblesse / And set it in blood and richesse / And
so to preue that he is more nobl^e than I. and ferthermore told of the
worshipful deeds of his auncestres / And how great Richesse and hauoyrs his
fadre had left to him / Soth it is / that the substance of his speech rests
in this / but he could nothing remember of him self. that he had do any thing
worthy or dygne of rehersayll or remembraunce^ And therefore he vttred nothing
of his own life and manners / And forsothe I trow / that noblesse rests not
in the glory of an other man. or in the flyttyng goods of fortune / but in a
man's owen virtue and glory / ffor what is noblesse other than a certain
excellence in virtue and manhood which proves one man worthy. to be preferred
another. ffor semblably as man excels all other beestys / and not for his
force / but for his reason / so by the virtue that one man has / which another
has not / he excellyth him / ffor when a man has be excercised in the crafts
of grettest noblesse / that is to say / in Justice / pity / constaunce /
Magnanymyte / Attemperaunce. and prudence deseruyng a fame of excellence in
them. And has quyte him well to the gods Inmortall. to his fader and mother.
to his friends / kynne and his contreye / And has be nourysshed and brought up
in the doctrine of lectrure / then me seems forsothe / he should be called /
and reputed more noble worshipful and more famous^ than another as Corneli him
self said a lytil by fore. when he spak of his own manners / And on that other
side / he that is corrupt with cursed crafts. And betaketh him self to
cruelnesse / rechelenesse / Cowardyse / dystemperaunce / and Iniustyce / and
gives no force of Relygyon / ne of the good will of his friends or not to use
pity to his fader and mother in time of their need / fforsoth me seems / he
should be Iuged of all men a wretch / unnoble / shameful. and worthy to be
set a side fro all good company. It is not habondaunce of Richesse. ne the
noblenes of birth that may give or take away noblesse fro any person. ffor
the courage of man is the very restyng place of noblesse / the which dame
nature themperesse of all things here bynethe / has ordained and
establysshed to have chief preemynence in the life of man. and has enfude it
euenly in all men mortal / fro the first day of their birth / And she neuir
Joined it to the enherytaunce of possessions / ffor she will be at her lyberte
and fredam by thaduyse of virtue / to give it. to whom she lyketh best / And
like wise as a glass or a myrrour well made / shows the figure set by fore
it / if it be fair / fairer / and if it be foul / fowler / so the courage
which is pure and free / is disposed to take noblesse or Innoblesse
indiffrently. And there should no man accuse the largess of nature in this most
best. and excellent gift of fredom. ffor she gives to every man a like
courage / and takes none heed of their kynne powerer or richer / ffor there is
no man so nedy. so vile / ne so lytil set by / but when he is brought in to
this world. he is endowed with as good courage / as the sone of an Emperor or
king. and as apt to virtue and manhood / and peradventure in this cause I shall
not need to give many examples. what shall I say of them. that have been born of
simple and low kynne / which have grown to great worship. Of whom there
comes so great plente to my mind / that this day is to short for me to
reherce the less part of them. neuirtheles I shall reherce a few / beginning
at Tullius Ostilius. which was born in a full simple cotage^ And had fader and
mother so pour and wretchid that full few there were that knew their names /
And the said Tullius was an herd and kept beestes. and grew so in wisdom and
virtue. that at last / he occupied the grettest auctorite and dignyte in
this cite / And how he enlarged the same cite. and subdewed the veyentys. and
the fydenatys our grettest enemies / And brought them to our obeyssaunce.
It is open to you all / Also Seruius Tullius born of a bond stock atteygned
the highest governance of this cite / And byhaued him self so nobly therein /
that he made the sabynes^ your subgettes / and thryes he received his tryumphe
/ fferthermore he joined to this cite three hills / Also Marcus porcius Cato
was born in such another Cote / a full lytil hows like as was Tullius
hostilius. And he was in this cite of so great dygnyte and auctorite. that he
passed all other in his days. he was right noble and necessary to our comynte
/ he was in his time a worthy knight / and a very good clerk. and he was had
in great reverence of the cytezeyns / that by his wisdom he encreaced the
nombre of the Senators / And embelysshed the mageste of the Senate with his
presence / Every man knows also how Marius was born in the wild field. for
his fader and mother were so pour / and so abject a stok / that they had no
hows of their own. and yet in right great virtue and excellent manhood he
flowred / all ye know well / how he was first in the bataylle against Iugurtha
underneath his master Methelius. which was that time questour of Rome whom
the said Marius succeeded in his office of Consul And he byhaued him so well in
the said bataylle. that he put to flight the said Iugurtha / And Bokkus king of
Maurytanus which came that time with great multitude of people to socoure and
enforce Iugurtha. And when he had put him to flight / he wan many castellys and
fortresses. And at last took the said Iugurtha / and brought him before his
chare to rome / And there received his tryumphe. with right great glory. Aftir
that when the people which were called Symbryanes had won the field of the
Romans. which made all the cite to tremble and quake for feere / in like
wise as they did in time of Hanybal / Then Marius was chosen to be the
Capetayn of the field made again the said Symbryanes / where he had the
victory And delyuerd the cite fro feere and peril / And therefore he received
his second tryumphe / Socrates also which was the very myrrour of the wisdom
of man / whose doctrine has enlumyned all the scoles of philosophers / which
was also the wysest and cunningest of all mortal men / as great Appollo bears
witness / He had to his Mother a mydwyf / And to his fader a Marbyler /
Eurypydes also which excellyd in his time all other / in writing of Tragedyes
/ And Demostene the most eloquente Orator of the greeks were born of right
pour and simple stock / And who is he that would or dar call them unnoble /
It must needs be granted that / either there is no noblesse among mortal men /
else if there be any it rests in such persons. as wysedom. force. manhood.
forsyght / and very virtue make them to flower above all other / And give to
them fame like to gods Inmortall / And Cornely thou know well thy self /
how unlike thou art unto mine Auncestres. in every thing concerning worship and
excercises of manhood. which proves well the contrary of that / which thou
have said. that noblesse is not knytte to blood. but to very virtue. that is
joined to the courage / ffor they tofore remembrid should neuir else be called
noble. which have been of simple and low birth / And many that have comen of
worshipful auncestrys that deserved. by their demerytes / not only to lose
their name of noblesse / but over that / to be called shameful and abhomynable
creatures / And some I shall reherce of thy kynne / And first I will begin at
the sone of Scipio Affrycan. which derked and defaced the vygorous and
virtuous fame of his fader / And that not a lytil with his cowardyse and folly
/ ffor when he was destressed and take with great shame by the king of
Anchioche. And knelyd before him. he weeping like a child. held up his hondes
/ And besought the said king to grant him his life. The said Scipio also /
when that he not by his merytes / but by the labor of Cisero * which was his
faders scrybe had gotten thoffyce named emonge us Pretore. His friends and
kynnesmen were so glad thereof / that they said / they herd nothing of long
time before / whereof they were more heavy / And they understanding his cowardyse
and folly. for fere lest he should have blemysshed the worship publyque of this
cite / or the worthy fame of his Inmedyat progenytours* ordained so among them
/ that he was neuir suffered to sytte in his place annexed to his office / ne to
give any Judgment in any cause / Also Publius of the same stock when he was
named Consul / And sent forth against Iugurtha that had slain Hatherbal and
yempsal the sons of king Mysipha / which were euir frendely. and welewyllers
/ to the Romans / And therefore the said Publius was commanded to take
vengeance of their deeds / he led his host so rechelesly / that our people
were neuir more wretchidly and perylously conduyted. And at last he was
corrupt with good which he received of Iugurtha / And therefore he made with him
an over shameful peace. which was aftir refused. and utterly despised of the
Senate. And him self therefore discharged of his office / to his grettest rebuke
and shame. where may any thing more vnworshipful / I should say more shameful
be told or reherced of any man / And what shall I say of the most graceles
young man named Lucius Fabius Maximus sone of Allobrogus. his faders worship
halpe him not. when he was known of so vicious and wretchid life / But Quintus
Pompeus that time praetor of this cite. bannysshed him perpetuelly out of rome
What shall I say ferthermore of the neuewe of Quintus Ortencius / the which
was a man in this Cite of great auctorite / And at last by evil company was
led so / that he foorced not openly to goo to the stews / and in sight of
all men. to have a do with common wymmen How supposest thy self Corneli. should
we deem them that we have reherced / noble / when their life so much wretchid
and full of folly. quenchid the bryghtnesse of their noblesse / what if they
would preche of the noble deeds and acts of their Auncestres / Or what if they
would show graven or painted images of them / in tharchys tryumphal or sacred
places. trowest thou thy self / while they were so vicious / that any wiseman
would for all that they could show / or remember / either preyse them or set
by them / Then it should seem better for their own pleasyre and worship to
keep scilence / than to speak any thing of their progenytours / ffor there is
no man / but he would think hem the more to blame. that when they had so
worshipful an example set before their eyes / they forsook shamefully and
wretchedly to follow it. and me seems though their faders had don neuir so
much for the weal publyque of this Cite. it should in no wise be dettours to
their childeren. which ben of reuerse conditions / ffor like wise as their
faders did embelysshe all this cite / So they spotten and defowlen the same.
Their faders set our cite in honor and surete^ And they every day put it
in peril and nonsurete. Their faders by their virtue and force delyuerd our
cite that when it stood in great Ieobardye and peril. And when it was in
grettest rest and peace / they have set it in great trouble and disordynau^ce
And what should such men mow claim by their merit or deserte in our cite /
when it had be good for the same never to have seen them / and to their faders
/ neuir to have begoten them / namely when their said faders. preferred our
weal publyque their lives / It is not then to doubt / that if their faders
were on live / and certainly advertised of their vices / they would Judge them
acordyng to their demerytes to great turmentys / death / or prepetuel exyle /
ffor many like young men of semblable manners. have been by their forfaders
condemned by Judgment / as brutus. ffor when he had understand / that his
sons conspired again our weal publyque / he made them first to be beat with
rods / and aftirward to be byheded / Also Cassius made his sone / which
rebelled against thempyre of Rome to be taken / And forthwith sent him sore
scorgyd to the Senate / there by Judgment to receive his death / Like wise
Maulyus torquatus one of the most noble Cytezeyns that we have had / when his
sone was empleted of debt. took upon him thexamynacion of the matter / And when
he understood his sone truly accused / he yaf his sentetence in this wise /
Sith it is so. that my sone has robbed this cite / of so much money / And
blotted gretely the fame of me / and all his kynnesmen. by the brekyng of his
faith and promise / I Judge him unworthy to enter his faders hows / or to
receive any benefayte of our estate publyque / or to come in the company of
any worshipful Cytezeyn / which proves sufficiently that they / which ben not
like their faders in virtue. should not be like to them in any reward given by
our estate publyque / ffor like wise. as in a derke glass or myrrour a figure
does uneath appear / so in the childeren that be vicious. The virtue of the
fader may uneath be seen / Therefore Cornely thou have a full vein supposyng /
when thou trowest that the glory and noblesse of the faders must be left to
the childeren / as a thing of enherytaunce / And all this booste that thou
make of thy kynne. it sowneth much rather to their lawde and worship than
thyn / And though Childeren have blood / and all thappertenau^tes perteynyng
to the body of their faders / yet the very noblesse / which rests in the
spirit and courage / may not be had without a man's owen labor and
deserte / And where as thou say that lettred persons call them properly
gentylmen which ben descended of noble kynne. fforsothe I hold well with that
/ so they be like in such virtues / as have caused their forfaders to be
called noble / And as for thy self / if thou challenge it by that title / Amend
thy manners / or give over thy cause / But I trow better that persons well
lettred will rather note them / which ben them self cowardes. and have more
manly forfaders with degeneracion / than nobleness / Sith that they be so
different in manners fro their kynne / It is daily thing of experyence. that
ma^y a worshipful man has full vnworshipful Childeren. And many a wise man has
had fonnyssh Chylderen / And many a virtuous man. chylderen vicyous / And there
thou leyest the vulgar oppynyon for thyn auctour. I hold it full easy to
dysaproue / sith it is so chaungeable and full of errors / And it is very
certain / that the said oppynyon acordeth full seeld with wisdom. But now late
us descend to that pouerte / that they which be noble or gentilmen have
diverse times fallen in / where was there oughwhere a pourer. than Marchus
Agrippa which was passyngly excellent / and necessary to our thing publyque
/ which was in that caas / that when that every man was taxed at a certain /
there was nothing found of his patrimony / which might relyeue or augmente
our common tresour / was not our commonte fayn for as much as Ualerina
Publicola that had quyt him so notably often and many times for our estate
publyque / dyeng in such pouerte / that he left not where with he might be
enteered. but to burye him on their owen cost and charge. And how the people
of this cite called Lucius Cyncinates fro the tilthe and sowyng of his land to
the highest Empire / It is easy to remember / how the said Lucius proved him self
of such virtue and courage / Then when the Palestynes had biseged this cite
/ he brake not only the seage / And chaced them to the flood named Alba. but
over that / he wan and subdued echt great cytees / which were the chief
helpers and courageours of them in their wars / And all this victory he
achieued and parfyted in twenty days / And how glorious was the pouert of
Actilius Seramus / whom when the Senate had called from his plough to thoffyce
of consul / he acquyted him with so great vigoure / that he destressed their
enemies and set them in surete. but yet that not withstondynge. the dygnyte
of thoffice which bare the playsirs of this cite / ne the richesse or worship
which he gate in our werres / could not let him / but that he would return
to his first labor / and them which were so worshipful in marcial discipline
/ and so virtuous in living / shall we call unnoble or wretchid / Is there any
man so destitute of reason / that will call them / but most noble / which have
co^serued our weel public alwey in noblesse. me seems this example
suffycient to prove / that noblesse may be joined with pouerte / And pouerte
with noblesse / Ne let no man trow. but that a pour man. which has
worshipful manners and virtuous deades should mow well be called noble and namely
these which I have reherced. that acquyted them so manly and assuredly / for
their estate publyque / friends / and kynne / when they had grettest need of
comfort and socoure / Were not thies folks lyberall / and worthi to be
praised in the highest degree of lyberalyte / when they left all their owen
playsyr / and prouffytes / to do their seruyse for the comyne weal / I trow
it was a gretter lyberalyte to give to their cite the fredom. which was taken
fro it / and delyuerd their kynnesmen and friends from all peril. wrong / and
Ieobardye / than if they had departed al their hole patrymonye to their ^^te.
kynnesmen / and friends / And who so euir payneth him / be it in things
publyque or pryuate / to be called lyberall / so much the more he is proved
every day more lyberal. when he uses his dylygence and deuoyr to promote his
cite kynne / or friends / Then Cornely the lyberalyte of a worshipful pour
man / may be right great and such / that pouerte may not dispoylle the
virtue of noblesse / Honest pouerte may take away no part of virtue. Was it
not the fairest gift and rychest lyberalyte of nature to give every man power
and abylyte to be virtuous / And therefore she has set it. in the inward
places of the spirit / and not in the foolhardynesse of fortune / And there is
no hap so hardy and so comberous / that may take vetue from him / which is
well wylled to keep it / ne there is no hap so merueyllous or plesaunt / that
may bring worship to him / that is a recheles man or a coward / fforsothe it
is. if fortune had soueraynte above virtue / within a while there should be no
virtue / or any merit of virtue / ffor the choice of things to be
worshipfully parfyted / should much rather rest in fortune / than in the
disposicions of our fre wylles / And therefore Cornely seace of that oppynyon /
That is to say to trow that virtue / lyberalyte. and noblesse / should have
their first / course. or beginning in thaboundaunce of Richesse. ffor then it
should follow / that how worshipful a person were / when so euir he faylled
richesse. his name of worship should seace / And the contrary is true / ffor
that / which is very worship or noblesse / is neither subgett to fortune or
hap. And tho men which I have reherced. before their pouerte attended / should
neuir have ascended so high in honor / ne have meryted such fame of worship
as they did. And therefore ye faders conscript. if worshipful progenytours have
had chylderen worshipful. And if pour progenytours have had worshipful
childeren. And if merueyllous and great virtue have rested in such as have be
right pour. The sequel is to your wysedomes manyfeste. which is this / that
noblesse rests neither in richesse ne in blood / but in a free and a noble
courage / which is neither servant to vice ne uncleanness / but is excercised
in connyng and virtue. And he that is endued with such a courage / deserves
best to be called noble / worshipful / and excellent / therefore in this
contrauercy of noblesse having / between me and my fellow / me seems he should
best deserve the palm of victory / that may prove him self most virtuous and
worshipful / ffaders conscript I have lever in that byhalue to have one other
to speak for me. than to speak my self / leest I speak any thing sownyng unto
my own lawde / and be boosted with the vice of boost / Neuirtheles it is to me
inly joyous when I behold your most right wise courages and most benygne
humanytees. ffor I wot well / I shall mow say nothing in praysyng of my self
untruly / but that ye will understand it well enough. And this / that I shall
say of my self truly shall not mow hurt me in your conceytes / I trust ye
know the life / and the manners of us both well enough / how be it I shall
remember your wysedomes and / acustommed benygnytees / what my life has been /
sith my first years / fforsothe when I was right young I was set to scole /
And when I wexed more ripe of years. I took great pleasyr to spend my time /
in the study of philosophye / And me seems I could not have spend it bettir
ne more worshipfully / and to my maistres I had them that understood both
greek and latin / and certain years I abode in athenes to here the greeks / the
princes of eloquence and phylosophye / And how gretely I profyted there / I
report me to the judgment of them. which be parfyght in that tongue / yet I
may say thus much of my self. that there was no day which passed me idle /
ne no night without study and lernyng of somewhat / The which hye desire to
have knowledge of connyng was granted to me / I deem of nature / ffor me seemed
my mind was never appeased but when it had knowleche of some thing / that I
knew not a fore. And of the very truth of things / I had plente of
masters and techers / and many lerners with me. And emonge the wisdom of so
many / there might no man be left an ydeotte / I was so used in my yongthe to
the doctrine of virtue / that there is left no place in my courage of vicious
desires / ffor in good feyth vices be to me as noyous / displesaunt. and
grievous as they may be. And virtues as plesaunt. joyous / and acceptable as
they may be / But aftir that when I remembered me. how every man which has
virtue or conning is bound to serve therewith the estate publyque. I gave my
sylf hoolly and fully / to the weal publyque of this cite / And when I had do
so / I neuir stynted to think upon the weal and thencreace of the same.
dredyng therefore no peril or labor / I neuir spared my self in that. which
should cause it to flower in worship and surete. ffor few years passed / when
our sees were occupied and encombred with pirates. And Gayus Flammineus Publius
a man of great worship / had take upon him the charge of your nauye and
ships / And had delyuerd to my governance ten shippis of forstage / for to
fight ageyn one of the rouers called Horantes / It fortuned me to mete with
him. and to board the same ship in which he was him self / And how be it /
he resysted manly and with great force trustyng upon the multitude of his
ships and people / I ouercam him and brought him and all his nauye to my
capytayne^ Also in the battle again Metridates I was a knight / and in the
seruyse of the same Emperor / And how often I had for my guerdons / the round
crown accustomed to be yeuen to that knight which auaunced him self / most
ferforthly and manly in the bataylle / I report me to mine Emperor and
felawship / And where is that worship that may be gotten in thoffyce or dygnyte
of Consul / by the merytes of knyghtly disciplyne. that I have not had / And I
trust to our gods that I have acquyted me in the years of my force and
lustynesse. that in mine age I shall not be rekened among them / which have do
nothing for our weal publyque / how well that I am be frended. ye my best
byloued friends / which be here now present / can bear sufficient witness.
And whether I have be ready in every place / to assethe your lyefful desires /
as well in things publyque / as / things pryuate. ffor I trow I was never
strange to do for you / that lay in my power / And of what faith / pity. and
love / I have been to you / ye all know well. Great grace and fortune I have
received of our gods to have so great benyuolence and frendelyhed of all
folks. ffor there is no man in this cite / ne in all the world has cause to
hate me. if he be not an enemy to our common weal / neuirtheles the so^me of
all my labors has restyd in this / to be a curyous sercher for our weal
publyque / merry at home / laboryous outward. besy to atteyne science / pyteous

things relygious. by the which means I have Iuged my self to atteyne best

make it more worshipful / Cornely then thyn / what be thy conditions / or
what is thy disposicions. where dydest thou any thing in thy days / that thou
canste reherce / where by thou would claim or challenge worship or noblesse /
where euyr received our cite any benefete by the. or any thing of lawde. where
by it might understand that thou were born in this world / ffor thou lyuest
among us here / more like a deed man than a quyck / where is there euir any man

lyberalyte. that thou spekyst of / peradventure thou have be prodygal unto

passing worshipful^ when thou have all thy loves about the / Iapynge. Ragynge
/ and wrastlynge with them in thy dronkenhede / And then to preche of the
noble deeds of thyn olders / I will not say nay / but confess that thine
Auncestres have be of sovereign auctorite and worship in this cite. And thou
vnwyseman to thy great shame / when thou remembrest thine own slouthe and

ffor where thou had thine Auncestres shynyng in worship like bright phoebus.

so derke and so blind a life as thou do. ffor they gaf to the a full
worshipful example in many and diverse wyses. how thou sholdest mow deserve
the great lawde and thank of thestate pulyque / And by their bryghtnesse they
showed to the / the very path to noblesse / As if they should say this way we
have hold. and it is easy enough unto the for to follow us / And thou have
forsaken the bright path which ledeth to worship / and have wilfully drowned
thy self in the derke pytte of foryetefulnesse / Trowest thou to flower in our
cite by the merytes. when thy self have so defowled the same with thy vices.
And trowest thou to atteyne worship by their benefayttes when thou doste
nothing well to our cite / Supposest thou with thy sleep / rest. ydelnesse /
wine / mangerye / lustys / and unshamefastness. to get that worshipful fame /
which they gate by their laborous watches. contynencys / hunger / thurst /
hete / cold / and so many diverse happes / Thou do err full hugely / ffor it
must needs be / if thou wylt have such title of fame as they had / that thou
make thy self such / in condycions and manners as they were / virtue is not a
thing of enherytaunce / And therefore essaye whether thou may find such
reason and wysedom as they used / ffor in their bequeste thou shall not find
that they bequethed to the their virtue / Thou say that there was nothing to
them in their last days / more pleasant / than to understand. the to have
received worship and reverence of thestates of this cite / And forsooth I trow
/ if they might come fro the places. in which they ben / there should be nothing
more grievous more displaysau^t^ and loother to their glorious spirytes. than to
understand / that our cite has so long suffered patiently thine errors and
vices unpunished / And I dar say / if they were a live / they would be the
first / that should punysshe the / either with death or with exile. O good god
art not thou ashamed to say that thou were norysshed and brought up with them
/ when thy self do live so foul and shamefully / that thou semest rather to
have be norysshed and drawn in the open houses of mysgouerned wymmen / And
thou affermest that thou do represente their images and likeness. And yet
know well enough / that thy cowardyse excedeth their worship. And I would
wit of the how an image may well be seen in a myrrour that is all for rusted.
And thou do suppowraylle thy noblesse with thy stately byldynges / fair
places / rich vyllages / and plesaunt feeldes / And desprysest my mean
suffysaunce in byldyng. lyuelode. and honest pouerte / but thou vnderstondest
full lytil / how gretely that Richesse / that thou have. is to thy shame^ And
that / which I have is to my worship / ffor me seems it is gretter worship in
lytil lyuelode to live worshypfully / than in so great haboundaunce to live
prodygally / inordenatly. and shamefully / Peradventure I have had as much
worship of knyghtly lawde in this Cite. as I could desire or coueyte / And I
live so aftir my lyuelode. that I trust to continue my life / without lack of
that. which shall suffyse me. and for the cause I desire no more / than that
suffyseth / I hold me well content with that I have / And it is enough to me to
have that I desire. And to coueyte that / which is reasonable. who so euir
coueyteth more / excedeth the bounds of reason / what could we desire more /
while we live here. than to live worshipfully / No doubt thereof who someuir
heepeth up richesse / trustyng thereby to satisfye all his desires / is but
vaynly occupied / ffor virtue and mesure ought to suffyse in every thing / And
noble courage can ascend to worship with lityl help of richesse. but a
wretchyd courage can neuir ascend to worship. though it be helped with neuir
so great plente of richesse / let no man fere to use virtue when he lacks

And not only this said work but the book of Tullius de Amicicia here to fore
enprynted whith treats so well of friendship and amyte / I m^ne the right
virtuous and noble Earl. Therle of wurcestre / which late pytously lost his
life / whose soul I recommende unto your special prayers. and also in his time
made many other virtuous werkys / which I have herd of / O good blessed lord
god. what great loss was it of that noble virtuous and well disposed lord /
when I remember and aduertyse his life / his science. and his virtue / me
thinks god not displesyd. over great a loss of such a man / consyderyng his
estate and conning. And also thexcercise of the same. with the great labors
in gooyng on pylgremage unto Iherusalem visytyng there the holy places. that
our blessed lord Ihesu Criste hallowed thith his blessed presence^ And shedyng
there his precious blood for our redempcion^ And from thens ascended unto his
fader in heaven. And what worship had he at Rome in the presence of our holy
fader the pope. And so in all other places unto his death / At which death
every man that was there. might learn to dye and take his death patiently /
wherein I hope and doubt not / but that god received his soul in to his
euirlastyng bliss ffor as I am informed he right aduysedly ordained all his
things as well for his last will of wordly goods as for his soul health. and
pacyently and holyly without grudchyng in charity to fore that he departed out
of this world / which is gladsom and Joyous to here / Then I here recommende
his soul unto your prayers / and also that we at our departing may depart
in such wise / that it may please our lord god to receive us in to his
euirlastyng bliss. Amen:
