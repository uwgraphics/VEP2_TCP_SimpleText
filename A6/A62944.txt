THE HISTORY OF CALES PASSION: Or as some will by-name it, The Miss-taking of
CALES presented in Vindication of the Sufferers, to forewarne the future.

To his much Honored Cousin, Mr JOHN GREAVES.
My worthy good Cousin,
HAving thus transplanted this little Leane-too, from the calmnesse of my
private Nursery into the bleak and open Champion; and not knowing how much it
there may suffer by the stormy Gusts of censure without some Extraordinary
stake supporting it, I thus betake me to your own good self for protection,
and if you please to pass it under the value of your Name, misdoubt not the
success, and shall with much cheerfulness intercept all further opportunities
of acknowledging my self,

Your most G: T.

To the Reader.
Be premised,
THat the following discourse issues not from any pruriginous desire of being
seen upon tl. shop-board, neither is it taken up by retaile and upon trust,
the fault of many Modern Poems, nor yet rushed into without being consulted,
and the second thoughts of such as suffered in it; but the contemplation of an
unfortunate journey, discovers here what were the Scruples that all along so
sorely wrung our feet, lest After-ages might unhappily wander into the same
gravilie way; which brief account being porch enough to such a little
building, let him now enter and take possession of what is freely presented him
by his affectionate Intelligencer.

The History of CALES Passion: OR, The Miss-taking of Cales.
SO many and serious are the Lessons that may be read in defeates and
deficiencies, and La Noue that great Master both of Pike and Pen, is in his
military discourses to direct in the point, that I have here the rather
dislected our unfortunate Voyage Anno 1625, so properly by-named the Cales
passion, or the Miss-taking of Cales, and thus discovered it, that posterity
might hereafter shun the Rocks upon which we suffered shipwreck: not longer to
deferr which important admonition, when upon the serious casting up of our old
reckonings, much dalliance and dissimulation was still found upon the Spanish
tally uncut out; and being hopeless of any reparation or amends, unless it
were exacted by the sword: To this end were all our yrons presently put into
the fire; but who shall consider the Levies, Ammunition, Shipping, and season
of employment, will rather reckon the design for a Pillar of smoke then of
Marble. Levies I say were made both in City and Country, but of such inferior
probability to the work, that some though weak and impotent, were yet taken
on merely by conspiracy, and with a let us kill them, that the inheritance may
be ours; some again so course and stigmaticall, even from the nipper of Bungs
to the pricker of Praunces, that Mr. Cunstable was rather Mr. Scavenger since
this farming all the beastly nookes and corners of them both; and then some
again (with impropriety enough) were imprested merely for expedition; those
employed in it, had their farms to visit, or their oxen to try, and hudling up
the number in List, regarded not the persons in poll; such I say were many of
those Argonauts which must yet fetch home the Golden Fleece, and that either a
Boult or a Shaft might be made of the business, conducted thus into the West
with much expectation, where through a lingering Vacancy of several Months,
without either requisite Officers or Accommodation, there succeeded much
disorder; and at Lorick in Cornwall so flat a Mutiny that Four of the
Delinquents were condemned, and cast Lots for the Gallows: by which Punishment
with a severe Proclamation backing it, there ensued a temper, their Fury being
reduced into the former Channel of Obedience; and then in this saire deport at
length were they handed over to some of our Redemanded Netherlanders for their
better disciplining, an importunate (I had almost said) an impossible
circumstance; neither can any trade be perfected without the Tools; if
Ammunition be wanting all our doublings are but Dances, and never before did
Mars exercise so long upon the Truncheon, never were the postures so long
slubber'd up by the Plymouth Cloak. It was far in September ere the Magazins
were open, the first of October we took Shipping, and I referr it over,
whether the mediate time could reach to more then a Tumultuary Discipline: were
they formerly taught by their Provisionall Officers; yet (if approving all
these of fit ability) where were the Materials? where Arms? the word drilling
does well distinguish of what they might attain to, for though some will
ignorantly take this at large, it imports no more then variis motibus
curfitare, but the Skill of distances, of Motions, but the parcel of a
tacticke, and if we should yield them this upon the Cudgel, yet where was the
Pike, where the Musket that should embolden Tom Tyro? then again they might
perhaps borrow some few Arms of the Country, and this is the utmost that may
be wrested; in answer to which, if we should grant a disjunctive, a single use
of their arms, yet is it much inferior to that in gross, and so little did
our Musketeers know to fire, advancing, retreating, or to Skirmish in flank,
that whereas our Retreit before Cales was furthered by many blinds, and the
broken site of the place, had it been to make in Campania, we may presuppose
how much we had been puz'led, and even a very dismal Catastrophie. As next to
which, and still as ominous, the business drawing out so far in length, and
full of prejudice to the Counties of Devon and Cornwall, they became remiss in
the Guard of their crosse-waies and passes, whereby many sufficient Men left
the service: and with such connivency that Maugre any freshest pursuit, I never
heard of any one intercepted. To conclude this point, some as but Lievres
Morrionez were dismissed of necessity, other-some had the opportunity to
dismiss themselves; and thus had our design both a blow and a counterbuff.

Concerning the Navy jointly Engaged, though formidable enough in Bulk, even
of eighty four Sail besides Hollanders, whereof twelve of the Kings, yet
through a tedious tract of time, and ere the Members of our Employment could be
knit into a Body, they began already so to fall from their feet, that when
homeward bound, and beating to and again, in the heights of 36 and thirty
seven degrees the half, for the Plate Fleet, our flaxen Wings booted little in
respect of our Leaden Heels, our Ships being indeed far fitter for the To be
trimb'd or made clean, of Carina the Keele of the ship.
kreen then the chase: or what if I should retract in this point, yielding that
they were yare enough of Sail, and could full sungly Plow up the brinie
billows, yet how bootlesse is it to show the teeth, when alas they cannot
bite; for thus had we come to Buckle, to dispute it in Fire, our New Castle Men
which were above forty in Number (and I assure my self neither to be last nor
least exposed) must have gone more roundly then really to work, since I could
never hear that they had either crossebarr shot or langerell. Nay there still
were other symptoms enseebling sore our Floting Body, the Viures, the Belly
Timber being likewise so notorious, that our Newland Fish was become rustie,
much of our Beer so necessarily staved for stinking, that some were as soon
put to Beverage as to Sea, the Husbands of the Fleet being much imprecated for
it, and the Soldiers often upbraiding their Generallissimo for Sr. James
Beverage; our Cheese was such, that, though amongst Soldiers and Sea Stomachs,
it is not yet disgested; much of the Butter might have been mistaken for Castle
Soap, and ere it came at the mouth gave the stomac enough at the Nose; but our
victualler being thus shroudly mired, and plunging now as he thinks into fairer
way, exclames here with a troubled Voice: yet what can be objected against the
Beef, Porke, Ling, Pease, Rice, and Poore-Iohn? for the first of which, though
I should warrant it in quality, yet dare I be bold both concerning it and our
Porke, that they failed much in quantity; no Ship* Husband or slaughter man
but is prone enough to lick his own fingers, a Surloine or a double Ribb well
befits his own Table, then again his Gossip must not lose her longing, so
that much being fraudulently decorted, though the prescript pieces were paid,
yet there wanted the Pounds: The Kings allowance was indeed Royal, but our
Purviers, Butchers, and Pursers are as many bushes, and extorting every one his
Lock, leave but a thin fleece; Concerning Rice, I spare not roundly to
complain, that for our own Ship, either little was laid in, or much
embezel'd, it is a neat Commodity, and so susceptible of cleanly conveyance,
that we were admitted it but thrice during the 9 weeks voyage; half our
proportion of Pease also, as submitting to the like legerdemane, was long
detained from us: and then for Ling, our Seamen were of such privitie with the
hold, that they put the pack upon us, had a double portion; only Poor-Iohn
deserves a better Title, and indeed to be Sir John, for this did us Knights
service, till by becoming a continual bush in every gapp, we had it at length,
usque ad nauseam. Fourthly, there is a Time also when Kings go forth to
Battle; 2 Samuel 11. ^.
which the Text specifies to be when the Year is expired, and the Scholiast
expounds to be the beginning of the Year, the Springtime; for thus will some
derive Lent a Lentando, of its supplying and tempering the Weather from
Asperitie; so likewise April ab ^periendo, as letting out the World again to
that Activitie which the Rigid Winter had so much obstructed. Now whether our
Scene of Action were seasonably laid is likewise so Remarkable, that heedlesse
of this wholesome Principle, and thus to time it, nay presumptuously striving,
even beyond Xerxes, to shackle the maine Ocean with a Ponderous Fleet, and full
of ominous necessities; we were commanded Aboard in the beginning of October,
but how miserably bandied up and down amongst the Billows of a Winter Sea,
will ere long be the doleful Subject of my Discourse. I should be doing now
with Lieutenant Littleworth and his Captain also (for there went but a pair
of sheers between them) and relate how stiffly they will maintain, that
writing, Reading, and Souldiership comes by Nature, that whatsoever some old
Motheaten Inkehorne Men have delivered, yet both Mars and Mercury may be made
of any piece of Timber, without exception; a Court Paradox, and reflecting much
also upon our present Employment; but enough of the premises (I had almost said
the portents) and these being thoroughly weighed, though like the man in the
Horn we went boldly and branchingly in at the great end, no marvel though we
came out again at the tip both squeased, and miserable.

I come now to the part Historical, the Voyage it self; for after a tedious
demurrer of near three Months, Sr. Edward Cecill (both Admiral of the Fleet
and also Lieutenant General, and Lord Marshall of the Land Forces) came upon
the 3 of September to Plymouth; so piecing us up with several requisites, that
at the Kings descent soon after, Sr. Samuel Argoll, who had been Employed with
eight and Twenty Sail against the Dunkerkers, presented him nine of their
Ships as prize; and our little Army was with such Approbation drawn into
Battalia upon Roober Down, that he there gave the Order to several Captains,
Sr. John Gibson, Sr. Sheffield Clapham, Sr. Henry Sprey, Sr. Thomas Thornax,
Sr. William Courtney, and Sr. James Scot, being made so upon the place, but
this glimps of jollitie was quickly faded; for though our expedition had
hitherto most unnaturally been long and lazy, we were now again full of Court
Confidence; and with more have then good speed, hurried soon after Aboard,
falling through Cat-Water into the Sound, and so to Falmouth, where my Lord of
Essex in the Swift sure expected us: of his Squadron. October the 9th we
wethered the Lysard, there meeting the Ann-Royall our Admiral, with the rest
of the Fleet, only the Lion our Rere-Admirall having sprung a Leake, was
dismissed back to Plymouth, the Saint George (in which Sr. Michael Geere
Commanded) supplying the place. Being thus United and running by an East South
East Wind, the Flagg of Counsel was soon after hung out in the Admirals
shrowds, Commanding our Sea-Captaines Aboard for Orders; after which again, our
own received a letter also from my Lord of Essex, with direction not to be
opened, but when accidently dissevered from the Fleet. Upon Wednesday at Night
the Wind came more large, but withal so Boisterous, that we were Twenty eight
hours in continual Tempest, the different Events whereof, and how cruelly we
were Labored in it, (that I might with some Variety refresh the Reader) is
thus discovered in the Poem following.

The Tempest.

ANd now after these Passive expressions in Verse, I return again in the
following Prose, to relate, that when upon Friday the fourteenth, the Wind
became more favorable, admitting a search into our scattered condition, we
found but Twenty two of the Fleet together; our own Ship (one of the best
sailers) being continually Employed abroad for their reduction, till Thursday
the Twentieth, when we rallied again about the Southern cape, continuing our
course till upon the next Saturday we came before Cales, entering the Haven with
such Reputation, and Incussion, that the Citizens in a long File, and much
affrighted were posting thence into the Continent. The Valiance of our old
English, came (as it seems) now fresh again in remembrance, and the flying
Opinion was, that had we Troop'd up immediately to the City Ports, their own
fear might have swaied much in their overthrow. For though a pacer often
declines the shower which a Galloper may overtake; yet Minutius also, if fitly
timing it, knows to win the day, when Fabius with his cunctation proves a
loser. Howsoever my Lord Marshall, like an experienced Gamester, chose rather
to go in upon certainties, and had no doubt good Cards for what he did, though
he let not every one see his hand. We came I say into the Haven with a fresh
briese, and all Came. fol. 807. At Cales action it was about two days after
they came into the Haven ere they Landed.
serenity, happy omens. My Lord of Essex and his Squadron had the Van, his
Vice Admiral and Rere-Admirall followed him, ours was the fourth Ship, where
while I stood observing what might issue, the Spaniard, at my Lords coming
within distance, propounded to him in Fire, receiving again the like answer,
and still did the Swift-sure so bear in amongst them, that in the dispute she
was six times shot through; but her opposites, as fearing yet a further
Engagement, and the general Storm, now close to Windward, and coming on
amain, chose rather to give way, and deferr at least what now they had but
little possibility to divert. Three of their Galleys flying to St. Mary-Port,
eight other, with about twelve Ships, through a narrow Channel to Port-Royall,
when lo Minutius again upon his close Pursuit might have stroke a Rich hand,
and in all likelihood cheap enough, which the Vice Admiral of Naples (a Ship by
report of about eight and fifty Brass Pieces) must needs acknovvledge with
me, since by dravving much Water, she ran on ground while she ran away, and
was thus sit-fasted for two days together, but here Sr. Thomas Love (held a
Leviathan for Marine abilities) haled us with a countermaund, injoyning we
should cast Anchor; to discourse the birth of which prodigious Remora, we had
but one heat to take, neither could it last long, and all our Irons must be in
the fire together. Concerning the Ships and Galleyes, there might be now much
have, yet afterward as good speed, if they could sail over land, well and
good they might take their course, otherwise they were locked up close at
Port-Royall, and our own sure enough. My Lord Marshall a cording to this happy
beginning might now rather fix upon some Land Service, and Improve himself by
Mastering the Island and City, which were indeed to full of diffidence, as by a
sudden engagement might be forced to despair, and this again would humble
both at his Devotion: these discourses (I say) might perhaps beget this
Procrastination, and our being here so jaded with an after Game; for when the
fourth day following, Sr. Thomas intended their immediate seizure, advancing up
to tow them out, and after him in Triumph, then arrow Channel was become so
much obstructed with Bottomes purposely sunck in it, that what he could bring
back was but a general Imputation, of either palpable Negligence, or
Ignorance. Not to dwell upon these merely Waterworks, but now proceed to what
was mixed, and partly at Land; five of our Hollanders were this night employed
in the battery of Pointall, a strong Obvious Fort with eight Brass Pieces,
half Cannon and Culverin, beating tightly, and point blank upon the Channel:
and these were likewise seconded the next morning by as many Colliars to as
little purpose; well might they Bark and Bellovv furiously, but it was
without biting; nay when our own Squadron next, and the rest of the Fleet
successively Vomited their utmost Thunder, yet stood Pointall immovable, and
whether it were the toughness of the Pile, or that our Ship Batteries have a
more fluid, a more yielding Center, which with an indisposition, a spissitude
of the mediate Air, might dull and weaken Execution, or some other Original
to be discussed among the curious Critics, Poyntall was directly shot-free,
we were but philliping a Rock of Marble; yet having at length vvth our much
prejudice Dismounted their Ordinance, even at the heavy loss of Sr. John
Bruise, Mr. George Raymond Captain of the Great Sapphire, some Soldiers in our
own Ship, as also diverse others, and the dear Rate of above four Thousand
great shot, we now this 23 being the Lords Day, went still more metteldly to
work. For my Lord Marshall had been formerly taught by his old Maurice Prince
of Orange.
Martial Master, that to fight such passionate Ambitious Papalins, does rather
Damask then Dishonor, we were now I say more Actingly fired; Sr. John
Buroughs and his Regiment being Employed on shore, to take it by Scalado. The
Weather was now Fair and Calm, and our Navy Rode about Pointall in a near
semicircle, circumstances admitting such intelligence, and infixing with so
much impression, that methinks I still see how such of our Long Boats as had
Evaded the Tempestuous Bay of Biscay, were now plying amain toward the
Fatal Fort: and what Pity was it, that Men of such height, and daringnes,
should so precipitately run upon their Ruin: when not the Celebrated old
Roman Braverie, but would here have been interposing either with their
Panosaids, or other like Defensatives. Methinks I still see how Mr. Bromingham
the Dukes Captain, who had the point and was to steel it, how and with what
Gallantrie he stood in the prow of his Boat, courageously Wav^^ing his Sword
about his Head; nor this only, when Fair and further off, while all was whist
and still, neither Man nor Musquetade stirring; but in the same threatening
posture Engaged home amongst their thickest Volleys, even when the Fort like a
many headed Hydra, plied him with such a storm of hissing Lead, as what Massy
Pillar but must needs suffer under it; and though he fell at length like a
Glorious Starr, and was seemingly extinguished, yet will his height and
Gallantrie never be forgotten. Concerning those Engaged with him in the same
Bottom, one alone of them (to prevent the Harquebuse of his Active distance)
could nimbly spring under the Castle Wall where it had less play; yet there
likewise instead of shelter met with his slaughter; the rest were in their
mettle so melted down with Death and many Wounds, that we could still see the
Boat, like an empty shell, beating upon the fatal strand, but not a man
stirring; which being well observed by Sr John Burroughes, and how unhappilie
spault the point had been through an over-heate, he cautiously declining to the
left hand, Landed there the rest without disturbance, and with such
approbation, that we of my Lords Regiment presently hudled after; so piecing
with him, and consequently streightning the besieged, that though they were
securely Walled, even Eleven paces thick, and with the toughest Stone, yet a
Treaty instantly succeeded, and then again as sudden a surrender, whereby we
took up our Lodging this Night at the Sign of the Starr; fuller both of quiet
and confidence. The next day being all Landed; our Design was far higher,
neither would we now go less then very Cales it self, to which we must
advance upon a surface of uneven and broken ground, even of many little hills
and holes, and so presupposing danger, that a Forlorn of some small dissever'd
parties was employed first to discover it, our maine Gross still following by
degrees; by which circuit of Action, as some of our Enemies must needs be
further recollected, other-some were still evading by us, and as it were from
between our teeth into the Continent; till at length a Reformado of my own
Company affectionately biting at such a bait, so tendered it likewise to some
commanded men next the Passage, that they quit their post, charging home in
hope of booty: the cautious manage whereof had doubtless found responsible
satisfaction, but as they fell up entire in a wedge, part of the Calizians fled
back to the City, others made as unrecoverably along the Pass, so that their
purchase was only some few trifling pieces casually fallen from the run-awaies;
however, thus was the City more expeditely surrounded in order to the further
threats of War; but alas, we were now at the full of our prosecution, so
waining always after, and far from any nearer approaches, that leaving the two
Colonels Buroughs and Bruce to make head before the Town, we were
immediately faces about, and marching up the Pass formerly specified, perhaps
to seize the Bridge of Swaco, which joins it upwardly with the Continent,
perhaps to refresh our Troops accommodated so very poorly, that for Eighty
men, my land allowance was but Eight little Cheeses, and some few Biskets* To
proceed, great was the peril, the prejudice that followed it, for having
marched like Knights arrant till toward Evening upon the deep sandy stony
Causey, we came at length to the house of Bacchus, there taking up our
quarters; and who shall consider the plenty of excellent wines, then and there
stowed in Magazin, or the swinish or disordinate abuse of them, will own this
expression to be proper enough; for mine own particular, as not knowing what
danger might be lurking under such a precious bait I referred my thirst to the
satisfaction of such Oranges and Lemons as the neighbor trees imparted; but
for many of the common sort, so palpable was their excess, so vvildly hooted
out in obstreperous clamours, firings, and like vvhimsicall distempers, as beat
up all the Rules of Discipline before it, seizing our Commanders with
extraordinary amazement; neither was there other address now left us but
immediately to heaven, which my Lord Marshall like a true Christian Soldier
as presently put in practice, by giving out God bless us for the Word. And
what shall I further say, but that this tyght and little prayer did by an often
repetition, and going continually the round, so strangely stickle for us, as
puzzel'd both the counsel and courage of our enemies, whereas had they found
to time it, and but given us now a Cammisado, we must needs have run a very
desperate Fortune. This tedious night of dread and danger being at length
vvethered out, we were now to retreat again, little dreaming of any
reckoning to be paid for our drunken deluge, till we found a body of
Spanishhorse attending upon our Rear, and exacting it with utmost cruelty, by
the slaughter of such as were left behind, either still and stupidly
surfet-seized, or else started aside and improvidently raking up and down for
plunder: neither did this outrageous Cavalrie thus give over, but still pursued
us, though cautiouslie, and at such a distance as they might either take or
leave at pleasure; till being jealous of such a near malevolent observer, and
at length haulting upon a neck of land, one way narrowed in by some comberous
salt-pans, and broken marsh grounds, on the other side by the sea, and a massy
steeple-like-building of several stories, we here laid a party of Musqueteeres
in Ambuscado, seeking thus again to repay these bloody Butchers in their own
coin: the trap was now I say fitly laid, we still retreating as before, and
our enemies likewise insisted, securely jogging on through the narrow neck till
very near a costly sulphurous entertainment, when upon a Soldiers careless
blowing his match aloft within the Tower, they sprung with much affright back
again, precipitately spurring away for safety, and by a sudden husbanding this
nicke of time, evaded to report how greatly little scruples, when irregular and
going false, may disappoint mighty projects; howsoever, though we thus failed
in the maine, yet befell it hence upon the by, that we could now return free
from any captious supervisors, and quarter again with our reserve before the
Town. The next day (our former Brigade being left at the point to answer all
Alarmes) an arrant we had up the Pass again, the purport of it to seize a
discovery of Long*boats for our better accommodation when homeward bound; for
now the Soldiers began generally to hitch and hummer after their return,
looking so often and affectionately toward the Fleet, that in our march back
we could evidently see 7. Galleys of S. Mary-Port, now engaging with that good
Ship of the Kings the S. Andrew; the weather was fair and calm, the Royal
Vessel all alone, and these creeping out like snakes in sunshine thus
propounded to her in a storm of ball and powder, to which our honorable
Countryman Sr John Watts (Commander there in chief) made likewise a seasonable
replication; for though his opposites fell up to and again, with noise enough
vapouring out their Ammunition, even when aloof off, and to little purpose;
this old and valiant Seaman, nothing moved with the chafe of their
vainglory, continued still in silence, his quu was not yet come; but having
in the mean time traversed all his pieces of furthest random conveniently,
and by this remissness whetted their Spanish arrogance into danger, he then
powered in so sour a broad side upon their bravery, that enough, enough, or
(perhaps too much) for market was done already; and they suddenly packed up and
home again, with as cold a welcome doubtless as our own was likewise empty at
our return before the Town: for the belly began here to bark so loud for
sustenance, and so with more noise, because the near storehouse of our
shipping might relieve us now at pleasure, that hither did we refer our
selves, here did we mediate with the sighs of our Soldiers for relief; but
this meeting with a deaf ear, and succeeding not, our last refuge was
either patience, or to value preposterous and unnatural for very vvelcome and
savory meat; my own Company being likewise so clear in the point, that a
supper of Asinegoes flesh wrought their extraordinary contentation, with a
nights rest so free from either inward distempers, or any outvvard sallies, as
better enabled us for our retreat the next morning. That I may decipher which
knotty piece, it was conferred necessarily upon my Lord of Essex, Sir Henry
Poor Viscount Valentia, and Sir Edward Harwood; the first of these was in his
very name here so formidable, that Hercules pillars fell at his arrival into
a shaking ague, and but for Sir Thomas Loves unhappie interpose, he had no
doubt out of the shipping alone returned a considerable victory; the second
hamor'd out his honor in the sad combustions of Ireland, having his former
valor there, written still and signally upon his forehead, in the midst
whereof the full impression of a rigorous bullet was so deeply infix'd, as if
Mars had purposely done it to set him fairer off; and never has any war (I
except none whatsoever) afforded a more remakeable, a more glorious badge of
honor. Concerning Sir Edward Harwood, I dare report him (even upon many years
observation) though sweetly tempered, and without noise in the house, yet so
high and active in the field, so far beyond our outside practice, and studied
even in the very learned points; and mysteries of his profession, that if
perhaps he might have some equals, yet none of his contemporaries out-did him:
and to speak much in little, this was the man whom that paragon of parts John
late Lord Harrington selected from a world of others to be his bosom friend,
and he likewise that having now the reere of all reeres, and disposing his shot
in loose and little parties among the broken hills and blinds, did in this
posture detain the enemy till our main Gross was mostly shipped again; but
after a long dispute, being now dangerously engaged, and much over-powred; some
fresh commanded men from the bodies of our reserve, not only fought the
prevailing Enemy into balance again, but soon after from his late gotten
ground; and though the command was to retreat, yet our new supplies still
dapperlie followed and fired upon them, till their Bandeliers coming at length
to be recruited, here the day began to change upon us, and our raw engagers
with their light matches, so suddenly, and in several places blew up our
powder, that at the Huffe our Opposites apprehending it, were newly whetted
into edge, and fell on again as bitterly as ever; now was the general cry
throughout the field powder, powder; in the Fort (where likewise my Lord
Marshall, and some other Commanders were observing us) retreat retreat with
Orders accordingly, and that the bringers up of our Rear should immediately
follow our main Body already shipped; which considering the present fear, was
with spurs and wings so very passionately fulfilled, that being to pass my
Pikes and Colors first aboard, as freight enough for our little Ship-boat,
yet did my Musquetteers so precipitatelie huddle in, surcharging and keeping it
aground, that I was compelled (wading the sea) to trim it again with my
Musketrest. Neither was it otherwise (as before is hinted) with our Soldiers
at the point, and now engaged; for what with the scarcity of powder, and then
the Calizians brisk and second charge, had not our Officers, with their rough
brows and swords, conjured this pang of fear into a sense of honor, their
heels had possibly been much more nimble than their hands; a disaster so
stiflie aimed by the pursuers, that through the broken ground they still beat
all along upon our Rear: and about this time was it that for intelligence at
the first hand, I now left my Musketteers haling themselves aboard, that I
might help wheel up one of our Drake areare, to some already at the point;
where I found our enemies so risen high in crest, that they were now advancing
out of covert after us into an open Level near the seaside; but then again
began our little Guns to play with so much terror and incussion, so fatally
spattering in upon their violence, that they as suddenly relented, and shrunk
back, locking themselves up again in covert; and thus after a passionate
dispute of near four hours, we wrought out the convenience (though with some
loss,) to quit Pointall, and ship our selves again in safety: for now was all
our hope among the briny Billows, all our confidence in Neptunes Kingdom; a
wild and open champion I confess, yet where the several roades were full of
precious ware and sumptuous plunder; by these did Cortez heretofore transport
his golden handmill of 3400 A Castelane is a Coin weighing a third part more
than a Ducat.
castelanes; his famous golden Colverin, and infinite other treasure; by these
came the vast east Indie caract of 1000000 ducates taken by our Leveson and
Monson; I, here the wealth, here the rarieties of the World are continually
transient: a motive so considerable, that though some would rather urge for the
taking of Dunshaul a rich city in the Madera Island, yet our admiral and the
Major voice declining it, our orders were rather to stand off to Sea amongst
these considerable passes; and in the height of thirty six and thirty seven the
half, to bid on still for an honorable welcome home, fortune would perhaps be
brought about with importunity, either ministering to us of the plate Fleet, or
some such after-game from the spiceries, as with remarkable stakes might draw
likewise an extraordinary reputation; or if the winds should again spit their
winter venom, tyrannously chasing us as before, Budgrave in the Streights was
appointed us Southerlie to rally in, Northerly the Isles of Bayon. Nay, we had
other storms here also to weather out, a dangerous gust, a personal clash,
rising at this time between Viscount Valentia, and my Lord de la Ware
Vice Admiral to the Head-Squadron, whose command being transferred upon the
former, and my Lord not digesting it, there ensued a peremptory competition of
two red fore-tops borne out, and pretending to the same place of honor for
several days together; till at length a temper being found, and the Viscount
made Admiral to the said Squadron, with my Lord in his remitter, and
continuing as before; we bore up unanimously to the heights premised, there
beating to and again for purchase, and to snap some of the Spanish golden
Ingots. Neither was the Scene unfitly laid, since October the 31. we had three
of their Ships in chase, and with such a near capacity, (as some will report)
that had one of our Captains kept his Luffe, when he bore room and gave over,
they happily might have defraied all our charges: but to chew this a little,
and distinguish whether it may be safely swallowed; let me here vouch the Ship
in which my own Company was mounted, one so yare of sail above others, that
my Lord Admiral had formerly owned, and employed it as his Page; yet was our
condition now so sad and sober, that though the being in chase often started me
from my Cabine 'twas all in vain, we never could engage; many a fair course
we had, where there was neither bush nor brier for the game to Tapish in, but
still lost ground till we were at last run out of sight; an instance so roundly
pointing out our indisposition, that doubtless he that runs may likewise read
it, and which must needs also scatter the cloud of prejudice injuriouslie
gathering over Captain Osborne. Nay so now began our Navy to groan under
several disabilities, that the Rainbow, and some other of our Shipping, were
the eighth of this November dismissed again for England, we which were still
behind (though likewise in our declination) persevering as before; neither
could the jolting watery wilderness yet awake us from our soft and silver
dreams, the plate fleet was now indeed our ultimate errand, our immediate
masterpiece; but without any piece of Plate fingered, save one of inferior
value, and this at the drunken quarter beyond Cales. In conclusion, having for
ten days after been vainly tacking to and fro, and with much pain and
patience hitherto weathered out the wrathful Winter, our wants and weaknesses
now at length became importunate, and at a Council aboard the Admiral, both
moved for an immediate return, and joyfully carried it; yet as the sour sauce
to this sweet refection, so were we hurried back in the stresse of a mighty
working sea, and even with such a witness, that part of our Fleet was beaten
in at Bastable, part at Bristoll, some into Sylly, our English Scylla and
Charybdis in respect of the Bishop and his Chaplains; into Falmouth, Plymouth,
and Dartmouth some; the waves like wild horses had thus torn asunder and
scattered the limbs of our Armado; that mighty bulk of our predominant
Anne-royall was yet tossed and tumbled into Ireland; Then concerning our
Vice Admiral the Swiftsure, she spent her fore-saile in the Tempest, split her
Tillar, and was so full of sickness, that an impressed of fresh men was
employed in bringing her from Falmouth about to Plymouth. The Constant
Reformation, in which my Lord of Valentia commanded, spent her maine mast by
the Cradle, yet far more unhappie was her namesake the Mary-Constance, and
even beyond comparison, as being wholly over-wrought in this boiling Tempest,
and swallowed down into the Sea; Captain Hone, Captain Shudborough, and
some fevv others being hardly recovered from the Shrovvds. To come nearer home,
and speak the bottom allotted that valiant Gentleman Captain Richard Bowls
the younger, my self, and our two Companies, though exteriorly it made as
good vveather as many other of the Fleet, yet our dangers since intestine and
near the heart, were therefore more fatal; that fire which a Kettle of
pitch accidentally kindled in our Cook-roome may witness it; and though by
Gods special providence this was again opportunely smothered, yet the
Combustion between our soldiers, and the seamen became unextinguishable; nay
sometimes so flaming hot as would needs have prompted in our pistols: The sea
Captain, though sufficiently seen in marine affairs, as having often sailed
between Temple stairs and Westminster, yet referred all to his Mr. (for this
he was indeed) and such a roughhewn Palinure, as merely swayed by passion,
made little or no bones of equity; a caveat against Captain Syllie-soule
hereafter, and demanding those of more experience, better government; the want
whereof, had like a continual dropping so daily fretted out our patience, that
being arived at Falmouth, I rather chose with Captain Bowls to land
immediately at Penycome-quick, (though penilesse*bench had been more proper for
our empty purses) then thus to suffer further, to be longer thus imbroyled: and
having once quit the Sea, here perhaps opinion will heal us up again, yet at
length presupposing a scene of extraordinary comfort and refreshment; but alas
the while so was death implacable, with such feud pursuing us from Sea to
Shore, that the passing bell was now daily groaning in our ears, and at
Plymouth alone, the elder Captain Bowls, Captain Blage, Captain Kirton, and
Captain Rice Skinner, with other Inferiors, were now deduced into their
former dust, by which scantling we may likewise guess at our sorry condition
elsewhere; only concerning my own Company, I must with all humble thankfulness
acknowledge, that God was pleased peculiarly to shine upon it with the light of
his countenance; neither had death but such a single conquest in it during our
whole Voyage, as yet defeated not the Corpse of an English grave: who shall
object, that as a tattered Colors, so likewise a shattered Company is of
greatest honor, yet there was never a more remarkable mercy, than when Israel
conquered the Midianites without the loss of any one Soldier; and an
hazarding with so much safety above others, must needs be an extraordinary
blessing. To close all with my peculiar; though outwardly I held up, and fair
a while after, yet this forbearance wrought so little quittance, that several
diseases (hence contracted) laid at length such peremptory fetters of a warm
bed, and a cautious diet upon me, that I was compelled to retire; and in the
following Stanzaes verse my self out of that profession, which I had been
formerly versed in for many years together.

Disloyal flesh and blood, how has the Snn,
Both his direct and oblique hitching course,
Full often through the heavenly girdle run,
Since our so plighted love, that naught could force
Or puzzle it; and do thou now deceive me?
Now at the quu, the clinke of honor leave me?
Our Mars in rust and cobwebs long decry'd,
Yet rants it now, and on the wings of Fame
Pitches his Tent, does now in triumph ride
On his high places; now to shrink? Be lame
And crasie now? When Medals double paies,
Victorious Belts and Crowns shall others raise.
Is this the troth of Friends? but then again
What Chimicall extraction, reach of Art
May flesh unweaken, and with such a train
Of draw-backs does our Age it self impart;
Such Paulsies, Gowts, Cyaticks, and Catarrhs,
It baffles Action, Wars even with the Wars.
Submit we then; the Moon her empty Lap
Again inlightens, and our Winter Trees
Have yet another rising of the Sap;
But Man when once declining, by degrees,
By fits, and pieces droope and dwindle must,
Till crushed at length, and crumbl'd to his dust.
The first Tooth that he draws convinces him
Of past his best, and not a Sinew strained,
Or Ligament, or Humor out of trim,
But urges so for Age, that lastly main'd
In all his structure, warping in his ties,
And several nails, he druckens hence and dies.
Submit we then I say, the Corslet quitting,
For a retired sedentary course,
Now not the Pike, the Pen is rather fitting;
The French Proverb is, Quiter le plume pur dormir sur le dure.
The Feathers, not the ground: ye brood of Mars
On still and thrive, while thus the topling stairs
Of age, advise and lead me to my Prayers.
FINIS.
