LONDON, Printed for PETER COLE. at the Glove in Cornhill, near the Royal
Exchange, 1641.

THE EARL OF STRAFFORDS SPEECH On the Scaffold.
MY Lord Primate of Ireland, (and my Lords, and the rest of these Gentlemen) it
is a very great comfort to me, to have your Lordship by me this day in regard I
have been known to you a long time, I should be very glad to obtain so much
silence, as to be heard a few words, but I doubt I shall not, my Lord I come
hither by the good will and pleasure of almighty God, to pay that last debt I
owe to sin, which is death, and by the blessing of that God to rise again
through the merits of Christ Jesus to eternal glory; I wish I had been
private, that I might have been heard, my Lord, if I might be so much
beholding to you that I might use a few words, I should take it for a very
great Courtesy, my Lord I come hither to submit to that judgment which has
past against me, I do it with a very quiet and contented mind, I do freely
forgive all the world, a forgiveness that is not spoken from the teeth outward
(as they say) but from the heart; I speak it in the presence of Almighty God,
before whom I stand, that there is not so much as a displeasing thought in me
arising to any Creature, I thank God I may say truly, and my Conscience
bears me witness, that in all my services since I have had the Honeur to
serve his Majesty in any Employment, I never had any thing in my heart, but the
joint and individual prosperity of King and People; if it have been my hap to
be misconster'd, it is the common portion of us all while we are in this life,
the righteous judgment is hereafter, here we are subject to error, and apt
to be misjudged one of another; there is one thing I desire to clear my self
off; and I am very confident, I speak it with so much clearenesse, that I hope
I shall have your Christian Charity in the belief of it, I did always ever
think the Parliaments of England, were the happiest Constitutions that any
Kingdom, or any Nation lived under, and under God the means of making King
and people happy, so far have I been from being against Parliaments; for my
death J here acquit all the world, and pray God heartily to forgive them; and
in particular, my Lord Primate I am very glad that his Majesty is pleased to
conceive me, not meriting so severe, and heavy a punishment as the utmost
execution of this sentence; I am very glad and infinitely rejoice in this mercy
of his, and Beseech God to turn it to him, that he may find mercy when he
has most need of it; I wish this Kingdom all the prosperity and happiness
in the world: I did it living, and now dying it is my wish, I do now profess
it from my heart, and do most humbly recommend it unto every man here, and
wish every man to lay his hand upon his heart, and consider seriously whither
the beginnig of the happiness of a people should be written in Letters of
blood, I fear you are in a wrong way, and I desire almighty God that no one
drop of my blood may rise up in judgment against you.

(My Lord,) I profess my self a true and obedient Son to the Church of
England, to that Church wherein I was borne, and wherein I was bred;
prosperity and happiness, be ever to it: and whereas it has been said that I
have inclined to Popery, if it be an Objection worth answering, let me say
truly, that from the time since I was one and twenty years of age, till this
hour, now going upon nine and forty, I never had thought in my heart, to doubt
of the truth of my Religion in England: and never any had the boldness to
suggest to me the contrary, to the best of my remembrance; and so being
reconciled to the mercies of Christ Jesus my Savior, into whose bosom I hope
shortly to be gathered to enjoy those eternal happinesses that shall never
have end. I desire heartily the forgiveness of every man, both for any rash or
unadvised word, or deed, and desire your Prayers: And so my Lords farewell,
farewell all the things of this world, LORD strengthen my faith, give me
confidence and assurance in the merits of Christ Jesus. I desire you that you
would be silent and join in Praires with me; and I trust in GOD that we shall
all meet and live eternally in Heaven, there to receive the accomplishment of
all happiness, where every tear shall be wiped from our eyes, and every sad
thought from our hearts: And so GOD bless this Kingdom, and Jesus have mercy
upon my Soul.

FINIS.
