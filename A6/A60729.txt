LONDON, Printed for Richard Lownes, at the sign of the Unicorn, on
Ludgate Hill, 1647.

MASTER SPEAKER
IN my last I promised to send you by the next an account of the proceedings
and resolutions of the Army at the late Randezvouz: I have sent you the same in
two papers unanimously agreed on there, by both Officers and Soldiers: I find
in one of them diverse things which your later proceedings since the resolution
of disbanding may have given satisfaction unto: but the Army having then no
knowledge thereof, it was thus passed and delivered to me, and I cannot but
send it to them: you may see what they then did remain unsatisfied in.

Understanding that his Majesty and your Commissioners were much straightened and
disaccommodated in the house at Childerley, I went thither yesterday to advise
with your Commissioners about the disposal of his Majesty, for more
convenience to himself and them, then that place did afford: The Commissioners
were pleased wholly to refuse giving any advice or opinion at all in the
business, and therefore the King declaring his resolution not to go back to
Holdenby unless he were forced, yet complaining much of the inconveniency he
suffered where he was, and pressing for a remove to Newmarket, and your
Commissioners not judging it inconvenient for him to be there: I ordered
Colonel Whaley this day to attend his Majesty and the Commissioners thither,
with a trusty and sufficient Guard of two Regiments of Horse, which accordingly
was this day done, and his Majesty with the Commissioners, gone to New Market,
but not through Cambridge. This business taking up the whole time yesterday,
and it being necessary his Majesty should be disposed of: Before the place of
Ra^dezvous could well be resolved on, this morning, at a Counsel of War, it
was judged inconvenient, and scarce possible to draw to a Randezvouz to morrow
early enough to dispatch any thing; therefore it is appointed on Thursday
morning at nine of the clock: and in regard of his Majesty's going to
New Market, it was thought fit by the Counsel of War, that the place of
Randezvouz might be altered from New Market Heath to Triploe Heath, five miles
from this Town: I shall take care that your Commissioners if they come to
New Market, may have notice of this alteration from the former appointment. I
remain

Your most humble Servant T. FAIRFAX.
Cambridge, June 8. 1647 For the Honorable William Lenthall Esquire, Speaker
of the honorable House of Commons.



A Solemn Engagement of the Army, under the Command of his Excellency Sir
Thomas Fairfax, Read, assented unto, and subscribed by all Officers and
Soldiers of the several Regiments, at the general Rendezvous, near
Newmarket, on the fifth of June, 1647.
WHereas upon the Petition intended and agreed upon in the Army, in March last,
to have been presented to the General, for the obtaining of our due and
necessary concernments as Soldiers; the Honorable House of Commons being
unseasonably prepossessed with a Copy thereof, and (as by the sequel we
suppose) with some strange misrepresentations of the carriage and intentions of
the same, was induced to send down an Order for suppressing the Petition; and
within two or three days after, upon further misinformation, and scandalous
suggestions, of the like or worse nature, and by the indirect practice of some
malicious and mischievous persons (as we suppose) surprising, or otherwise
abusing the Parliament; A Declaration was published in the name of both Houses,
highly censuring the said Petition, and declaring the Petitioners, if they
should proceed thereupon, no less then enemies to the State, and disturbers of
the public peace. And whereas at the same time, and since, diverse eminent
Officers of the Army have been brought into question and trouble about the said
Petition, whereby both they and the rest of the Officers were disabled, or
discouraged for the time, from further acting or appearing therein on* the
Soldiers behalf; And whereas by the aforesaid proceedings and the effects
thereof, the Soldiers of this Army (finding themselves so stopped in their due,
and regular way of making known their just grievances, and desires to, and by
their Officers) were enforced to* an unusual (but in that case necessary) way
of correspondance and agreement amongst themselves, to chose out of the
several Troops and Companies several men, and those out of their whole
number, to chose two or more for each Regiment, to act in the name and behalf
of the whole Soldiery of the respective Regiments, Troops, and Companies, in
the prosecution of their rights and desires in the said Petition, as also of
their just vindication and writing in reference to the aforesaid proceedings
upon and against the same, who have accordingly acted and done many things to
those ends, all which the Soldiers did then approve as their own Acts. And
whereas afterward (upon the sending down of Field-Marshall Skippon, and those
other Officers of the Army that were Members of the House of Commons, to quiet
distempers in the Army, fresh hopes being conceived of having our desires again
admitted to be made known and considered in a regular way, and without such
misrepresentations as formerly, the Officers and Soldiers of the Army (except
some few dissenting Officers) did again join in a representation of their
common grievances; and the Officers (except as before) did agree upon a
Narrative account of the grounds, rise, and growth of the discontents in the
Army, and their proceedings in relation thereunto, with an overture of the best
expedients, to remove or satisfy the same, both which were presented to the
same Members of the House, and by them reported to the House. And whereas the
Parliament having thereupon voted, and ordered some particulars, only toward
satisfaction of our grievances, has since proceeded to certain resolutions of
sudden disbanding the Army by pieces, which resolutions being taken, and to be
executed before full or equal satisfaction given to the whole Army, in any of
the grievances, before effectual performance of that satisfaction in part,
which the preceding Votes seemed to promise, as to some of the grievances, and
before any consideration at all of some others most material, (as by the
result of a general Counsel of War on Saturday, May 29. was in general
declared, and is now more fully demonstrated, in particular by a representation
thereupon, agreed unto by us:) We all cannot but look upon the same resolutions
of disbanding us in such manner, as proceeding from the same malicious and
mischievous Principles and intentions, and from the like indirect practices of
the same persons abusing the Parliament, and is as the former proceedings
against us before mentioned did, and not without carnal and bloody purposes
(for some of them have not stuck to declare or intimate) after the body of the
Army should be disbanded, or the soldiers divided from their Officers: then to
question, proceed against, and execute their malicious intentions upon all such
particular Officers, and soldiers in the Army, as had appeared to act in the
Premises in the behalf of the Army; and whereas upon a late Petition to the
General from the Agitants, in behalf of the soldiers (grounded upon the
preceding considerations, relating to the same resolutions of disbanding the
same general Council of war to prevent the danger, and inconveniences of
those disturbings, or tumultuous actings, or confluences which the
dissatisfaction and Jealousy thereupon also grounded, were like suddenly to
have produced in the Army to advise the General, first to contract the
Quarters of the Army, and then to draw the same to an orderly Randezvous for
satisfaction of all, and that his Fxc^llencie would immediately send up to move
and desire the Parliament to suspend any present proceeding upon the said
Resolution of disbanding, to resume the Consideration of the grievances, and
desires sent up from the Army, and not to disband it in pieces before just and
equal satisfaction given to the whole; And whereas some of the Regiments
appointed for disbanding, upon notice thereof withdrawing themselves from the
Quarters adjacent to the appointed Randezvous, and drawing toward the Head
Quarters; and the contracting their Quarters according to the said advice of
the Council of War.

We the Officers and Soldiers of several Regiments hereafter named, are now
met at a general Randezvouz, and the Regiments appointed, as aforesaid, to be
disbanded, have not appeared, nor can appear; but are resolved not to appear
at the several and respective Randezvouz, appointed as aforesaid for their
disbanding; and diverse other things have been done by several other parties or
members of the Army, necessarily relating to the good and concernment of the
whole in these Affairs: now forasmuch as we know not how far the malice,
injustice and tyrannical Principles of our enemies, that have already
prevailed so far to abuse the Parliament and the Army (as is before mentioned)
in the past proceedings against the Army, may further prevail to the danger
and prejudice of our selves, or any Officers or Soldiers of the Army, or other
persons that have appeared to act any thing in behalf of the Army, or how far
the same may further prevail to the danger or prejudice of the Kingdom in
raising a new War, or otherwise: Therefore for the better prevention of all
such dangers, prejudices, or other inconveniences that may ensue; and withal
for better satisfaction to the Parliament and Kingdom, concerning our desires
of conferring to the authority of the one, and providing the good and quiet of
the other, in the present affairs of disbanding, and for a more assured way,
whereby that affairs may come to a certain issue, (to which purpose we herein
humbly implore the present and continued assistance of God, the righteous Judge
of all) we the Officers and Soldiers of the Army subscribing hereunto, do
hereby declare, agree and promise, to and with each other, and to, and with the
Parliament and Kingdom as follows.

1 That we shall cheerfully and readily disband when thereunto required by the
Parliament, or else shall many of us be willing (if desired) to engage in
further Services either in England or Ireland, having first such satisfaction
to the Army in relation to our Grievances and desires heretofore presented, and
such security; That we of our selves (when disbanded, and in the condition of
private men) or other the freeborn people of England (to whom the consequence
of our case does equally extend) shall not remain subject to the like
oppression, injury or abuse, as in the premises has been attempted and put
upon us while an Army by the same men's continuance, in the same credit and
power (especially if as our Judges, who have in these past proceedings against
the Army so far prevailed to abuse the Parliament and us, and to endanger the
Kingdom; and also such security that we our selves, or any member of this
Army, or others, who have appeared to act any thing in behalf of the Army in
relation to the premises before recited, shall not after disbanding be any way
questioned, prosecuted, troubled, or prejudiced for any thing so acted, or for
the entering into, or necessary prosecution of this necessary agreement: (we
say) having first such satisfaction and security in these things as shall be
agreed unto by a Counsel to consist of those general Officers of the Army
(who have concurred with the Army in the premises) with two Commission-Officers
and two Soldiers to be chosen for each Regiment, who have concurred, and shall
concur with us in the premises, and in this agreement. And by the major part
of such of them who shall meet in Counsel for that purpose when they shall be
thereunto called by the General.

2 That without such satisfaction and security, as aforesaid, we shall not
willingly disband, nor divide, nor suffer our selves to be disbanded or divided.

And whereas we find many strange things suggested or suspected to our great
prejudice concerning dangerous principles, interests and designs in this Army
(as to the overthrow of Magistracy, the suppression or hindering of Presbytery,
the establishment of Independent government, or upholding of a general
licentiousness in Religion, under pretense of Liberty of Conscience, and many
such things; we shall very shortly tender to the Parliament a Vindication of
the Army from all such scandals to clear our Principles in relation thereunto,
and in the mean time we do disavow and disclaim all purposes or designs in
our late or present proceedings to advance or insist upon any such interest,
neither would we (if we might and could) advance or set up any other particular
party or interest in the Kingdom (though imagined never so much our own) but
shall much rather (as far as may be within our sphere or power) study to
promote such an establishment of common and equal right and freedom to the
whole, as all might equally partake of but those that do by denying the same
to others, or otherwise render themselves incapable thereof.

An humble REPRESENTATION OF The Dissatisfactions of the ARMY, in relation to
the late Resolutions for so sudden Disbanding: showing the particulars of their
former grievances wherein they did remain unsatisfied, and the Reasons thereof.
Unanimously agreed upon and subscribed by the Officers and Soldiers of the
several Regiments, at the Rendezvous near New Market, on Friday and Saturday,
June 4, and 5.
Presented to the General, to be by him humbly represented to the Parliament.
WHereas upon the Report made to the House of Commons on Friday, May 21.
concerning the grievances of the Army, That House was pleased to pass several
Votes seeming to tend toward the satisfaction of the Army in some particulars:
and on Tuesday following ( May 25.) to pass diverse Resolutions upon a Report
from the Committee at Darbyhouse concerning the disbanding of the Foot of this
Army each Regiment apart at several times and places: We humbly declare, That
the said Votes of Friday do come far short of satisfaction (as to the said
grievances) or to the desires proposed by the Officers in the conclusion of
their Narrative. And that the latter Votes of Tuesday importing a resolution to
disband the Army in part, before equal satisfaction be given to the whole in
the grievances or so much as any consideration had of some others that are most
material, and also before any effectual performances of that Satisfaction
with the Votes of Friday seemed to promise as to some of the Grievances, we
cannot but be much unsatisfied and troubled at it, as in the particulars
following it may apeare we have cause.

1. The proportion of but eight weeks Arreares to be paid at disbanding, as it
is unreasonably short of what is most due, and what we conceive may be paid, or
might easily have been provided, since the Parliament has so long had the
whole Kingdom cleared, all trading and commerce opened, vast sums of money
brought in upon Delinquents compositions and otherwise, and great foundations
of security in their hands (besides those formerly engaged for the Scots.) And
as it is but a mean reward for all our labors, hardships and hazards in the*
Kingdoms cause, and a very slender Supply to carry us to our homes in a
condition suitable to the Parliaments honor and our success, and much less to
enable those that have left good trades or other ways of livelihood, and
suffered much in their trades or stocks by so doing, to set up again in their
former callings and conditions; so it is but little (if any thing) more then
what has been due to us since that time that we first went about to have
petitioned for our Arreares, and so not to be accounted in Satisfaction
toward former Arreares, which the Petition was meant for.

2. In the Orders given for the stating of our Accounts, giving Debentures for
our Arreares by the Committee of the Army, we find no consideration or regard
had of our Arreares incurred in former Army or Services, which to the most of
us are much greater then those under the New Model, intended to be stated by
the Committee for the Army, as the Narrative of the Officers, Printed by
mistake under the name of their Declaration, did intimate before.

3. We cannot but consider, That (whatever the Officers expectances upon
Debentures may prove) the private Soldiers may well make little account of
whatever part of his Arreares he receives not before disbanding, as the Reasons
express in the Narrative do show. And whereas we hear of some Instructions
past in an Ordinance for stating of Arreares, we understand that they direct 3
s. a week to be abated to Foot-souldiers for quarter, which being 6d. or 8d,
per diem* above the rate they should have paid for themselves, if they had
timely had Pay where withal: It seems very hard the poor Soldiers should
allow interest for the forbearance of his own due.

The like disproportion we find in the abatements to Sergeants of Foot for
their Quarters: in the abatement for Quarters to Officers of Horse and
Dragoons, we find one third Part of the whole Pay to them due both for
themselves and their Horses is to be defalked, though the full Pay for their
Horses is not allowed in the Account, unless they make it appear by Musters
that they kept their full numbers; and the third part of their full Pay,
amounting to the half or near the half of their present Pay, seems an
unreasonable allowance for Quarters, especially in the case of Captains and
Field-Officers. We find also no Provision made for private Soldiers of Horse,
or Foot, or any Officers in Commission or not in Commission, in relation to any
Quarters discharged by them, but all such are left absolutely to abate the
respective Rates for Quarters, during their whole time, whether they have paid
Quarters for any part of the time or no, whereas we know assuredly, and can
make appear, That all of them, during their Service in this Army (and most of
them in their Service in the former Armies) have really discharged their
Quarters for a very great part of the time, and many of them for more time then
by the proportion of pay received, they were bound to have done, having without
respects to that many times paid freely, as far as their money would hold
out, partly out of desire not to be burdensome at all to the Country as far
as they could, and partly upon expectation (grounded on the many promises and
often renewed of constant pay for time to come) that money would come in time
to pay them up, and re-imburse them their full pay again without defalcation
for quarters; we find it also provided. That no Trooper is capable of allowance
or Debenture for Arreares unless he deliver in such Horse and Arms with which
he has served, or a Certificate, that such Horse and Arms did not appertain
to the State, or else was lost in actual Service, which extends to the total
taking away from them those Horse and Arms of the States which they have used
and preserved in the Service, contrary to the favor allowed, and never (that
we knew of) denied in the disbanding of any other Army: And if that being but a
matter of favor, the Horsemen in this Service be thought unworthy of it, and
must upon account for their Arreares, rebate for such Horse and Arms as upon
disbanding they thought to have been given them, yet it seems hard that such
as cannot deliver in those States Horse and Arms, which at disbanding they so
understood to be their own, and so perhaps have sold or otherwise disposed of,
should for that lose their whole Arreares, or be incapable of account or
debenture for any part thereof.

Fourthly, The visible security for what Arreares should not be paid at
disbanding (which the Votes of Friday May 21. seem to promise) as it stands
propounded in the Votes of Tuesday May 25. appears not to be either a
security sufficient or to us visible.

1. Because that security of the Excize in Course (proposed for the Arreares of
private Soldiers and inferior Officers is knwne to be already pre-ingaged for
vast Sums amounting to above a Million that are to take place before those
Arreares, nor do we know certainly that the Excise (which is yet but
temporary) will be continued for so long time as till our Arrears shall come
out in course after the preceding engagements satisfied

2. Because that security proposed for Officers Arreares, viz. the profits
arising out of Delinquents estates in the first Exception (especially) being
limited to such as are not already disposed of, it does not appear what they
will amount unto, or what the pre-ingagemens or pre-disposures by the
Parliament may be, or what encumbrances of Debts, or limitations of Estates (as
they were in the hands of the owners) may lie upon the same, none of which we
would be any occasion to defeat or avoid, so as to have the curses and grudges
of defrauded Creditors or ruined Families to lie upon us or our posterities.

3. Neither the one security nor the other are yet, for ought we find, or
could well before the appointed times of disbanding, be so settled by Ordinance
to the uses proposed (as the other Securities for moneys borrowed by the
Parliament have been) which we conceive requisite to render the same indeed
visible security.

The two first of these Reasons we should not urge so much, if we did not see
other matters of security within the Kingdom that would be much more clear,
(as Cathedrals and their Revenues, Forrest-lands, etc.)

5. The Ordinance voted to exempt from Pressing, first is not, for ought we
understand, brought in and passed before the appointed Disbanding. Next, by the
Vote it seems not to intend the exempting of Voluntier Horsemen from being
pressed for Foot-service. And lastly, we understand not how it can be effectual
to particular Soldiers (when dispersed about the Kingdom, and so journing or
traveling where perhaps their former relation to this Army, or condition as
Volunteers in it may not be known, or not credited upon their words) unless
the Ordinance intended shall provide, That a Testimonial of their service
under the General's or their respective Field-Officers or Captains hands
(which they might ever carry about, or keep by them) shall be their sufficient
discharge from any Press (if they shall fall under it.) And whereas such
Testimonials cannot easily be got by them after Disbanding, the said Votes for
so sudden Disbanding, and at such distances, do not mention or admit any thing
of that kind more then Passes from the Commissioners to carry them home.

6. The Ordinance voted to give Apprentises the benefit of their time spent in
the Parliaments service, as also that for the maintenance of maimed Soldiers,
and the Widows and Children of men slain in the Service were not brought in
and passed before the appointed Disbandings, nor do we yet hear, that they
yet are, though we hope they will be.

7. The Ordinance passed for Indemnity seems to make but slender provision for
our quiet, ease, or safety, in relation to things done in the War as Soldiers.

1. Because the things it provides for throughout the Ordinance, comprised only
in these terms (viz.) Things done by virtue of any Ordinance of Parliament, or
for the service and benefit of the Parliament; We conceive, That upon every
trespass, or other thing done in the War (which we may be questioned for) it
will be very chargeable and difficult, either to derive a clear Authority for
the same from Ordinance of Parliament, or to bring proofs sufficient to make
up such a constructive conclusion, as that it was for the service and benefit
of the Parliament, especially to do this so fully, as to meet with all the
evasions and elusions of a subtle Lawyer, or to convince the senses of a
Countrey-Jury, whom we know not by what rules or measure they may go in judging
what was for the service and benefit of the Parliament, or what not, perhaps
some of them may be of that mind, That it had been for the service and benefit
of the Parliament, to have had no War at all, or to have had fewer or no such
Garrisons or Forces as some of us have been engaged in. In sum, We cannot
think it safe to be left to the fence or construstion of a Countrey-Jury,
concerning the exigencies of War, or duty of a Soldier upon so doubtful an
issue; we should rather think, That the old issue, which (as we understand)
ancient Laws have provided for in such cases, viz. (Whether the thing were
done tempore and locobelli) was much more clear and sure; and an Act or
Ordinance of Oblivion for all trespasses or other things so done by Soldiers
in this War, would be most safe and satisfactory.

2. That the provision in the said Ordinance now past for Relief, by complaint
to a Committee of Parliament at London, (which seems to be meant for saving of
charges to poor men) we doubt will prove a very remote help, and far more
chargeable for a poor Soldier imprisoned or Arrested in the Country, then
the former: and though we highly honor that Committee named in the Ordinance
(for the major part of it) yet we confess we shall be sorry that our relief
(if it may otherwise be provided for) should be the occasion of setting up more
Arbitrary Courts then there are already, with so large a power of imprisoning
any Free men of England, as the Ordinance gives to that Committee, let the
persons entrusted appear at present never so just and faithful, or though all
that Committee were as good Patriots as we hold the major Part to be.

3, In the matter of Accounts, we are wholly left (as before) to the mercy of
the Committee for Accounts, and their Sub-Committees, whose constitution (in
most Counties) being a least of Neuters (disaffected to the War, and
consequently to the Soldiery) and whose vast and arbitrary power to vex,
delay, fine and imprison at their own pleasure or judgment, any that they can
bring within the compass of accomptants, and to proceed upon their own
judgment of the default, to sequester, sell and dispose of his Estate; as upon
a Commission of Bankrupt (we confess) we tremble to think of more then of
any Enemy. And though we are as jealous as any to have all men brought to an
account, for what may clearly be accounted for (as Treasurers, Keepers of
stores, Sequestrators, or such like accomptants) yet we cannot but think it
hard for us, or other the Parliament Soldiers, to be required to so strict
accounts for all things received, taken, and used in the War by our selves, or
any under our command (though but temporally upon a part) for many of which
things neither we nor any other that minded the public service, and have bin
engaged in hazardous services, where many have lost those accounts they did
keep, can give or could keep so strict account, or for want of such account to
be so cruelly vexed and prosecuted, even to utter undoing, as any man that is
accomptable for any thing that may be, and diverse of the Parliaments most
faithful and active Servants in our condition have been before our eyes: And
though we would not wish that any Soldiers or Officers who have by Plunder, or
other Injury to the Country, abused the name of the Parliaments Service, and
converted any thing they have taken or received to their own private benefit
or advantage, (more then for necessary subsistence or supplies) should go away
with it, in being exempted from account; yet we cannot but think it reasonable
and necessary, That for those many others that have not done so, but have
employed all faithfully for the public service, such provision should be
made, as that what Arms, Ammunition, Horses, Furniture, or other things
received or taken by them, they could not keep, or cannot give a clear and
distinct account for, it should be sufficient for their discharge, if they
make Oath, That they have not imbezelled, or wittingly converted to their
private benefit or advantage, any part thereof, more then what things, or to
what value they do or shall (for saving of their Oath) charge upon themselves
in their account.

We find another thing mainly necessary for our and other men's Indemnity (for
which there is no provision at all made in this Ordinance) viz. That all Acts
of Counsels or Courts of War, either in censure or discharge of any person,
for any cause subject to their Judgment, and the Warrants of the General, or
chief Commander, for execution or remission of such censures, may be valid and
good, both as to the Justification of those that have been employed in
execution of such censures, and also the full and final acquittall of the
persons so discharged or remitted.

Eighthly, Though those Officers of the Army at several times sent for, or sent
up to attend the Parliament as Delinquents, have been indeed discharged (for
which we render our thanks and acknowledge the Parliaments Justice in the
discharge) yet for men of such credit and integrity to have their names brought
so highly into public question or suspicion, and the cause not known (which
might make it imagined greater) to be kept long in attendance under that
notion* and not obtain by their daily solicitations to know their Accusers, or
any Charge (and for one of them) to be made a Prisoner, searched and sent up so
far in a disgraceful manner, without Authority (against the right both of a
Soldier and Subject) and at last to be only dismissed (without any word of
Vindication or clearing) seems but a slender Reparation.

Ninthly, There has yet been nothing declared by the Parl. (as in the
Narration or Declaration of the Officers was desired) to clear us, as to our
right of Petitioning, or to clear the fence and intention of the Parliament in
their Order for suppressing the Petition, or the ground of their censure in the
Declaration against it; Though we think no man can deny the matter of the
Petition to be just, and Parliament-proceedings, since upon the several heads
of it does imply as much: And if our liberty of Petitioning for our due be
denied us now, and the attempting of it rendered such a Crime (as by the said
Order and Declaration appears to be, while the ground or intention of them
stands not explained otherwise) we cannot but expect the same or worse
hereafter, not only to our selves (when being disbanded and dispersed, we shall
have the like occasion to Petition as private and single men) but also to all
the free-both people of the land in the like case; and so this president (if it
stand good) would eextendin the consequence of it, to render all Soldiers
under the Parliament, the worst of slaves, and all Subjects little better* And
though there have been of late in other men's Cases too many dangerous
Presidents of suppressing Petitions, and punishing or censuring the
Petitioners, yet (we think) few or none so full and clear against all just
Liberties, as this in our case whose Petition was not, as many (that yet have
been received with large thanks) without any foundation in real grievances or
dues, tending and serving merely to declare the Petitioners opinions and
inclinations in relation to matters of State (then in transaction, or intended
to be put on in the Parliament) nor yet subject to any of those exceptions,
which at other Petitions (seeming better grounded, more necessary or concerning
then the former, and yet rejected) might be; But ours not meddling with matters
of State, with proceedings of Parliament, or any bodies concernments but our
own, tended but to obtain particular dues (often promised, dearly and fully
earned, long forborne) and some of which ( viz. the matter of Indemnity) we
could not (without danger of utter ruin) want after disbanding; and these but
desired in an humble and submissive way, without any language, scandalous or
offensive, or any other particular exception (for matter or form) that we have
ever yet been told of, or could any way learn; so as though we are willing to
believe the Parliament was misinformed, abused or surprised in the businesses
(as the Narrative does express) yet we cannot hitherto understand* from whence
such proceedings against such a Petition, or against us for it, could arise,
except (in those that moved and drew the Parliament thereunto) from some
principles of Malignants envy or dislike against us, the Petitioners for the
things God has done by us, carrying them (above all other considerations of
just or unjust, dangerous or safe) to this end, as the greatest good, that this
Army must not pass with that Reputation God has given it, but must (upon any
occasion that could be catched hold on) have a dishonor put upon it, and by
discontents and provocations be put into distemper, so as to do something that
might render it ^dious, or bring a blemish upon it.

Tenthly, the Declaration yet standing in force, and nothing published by the
Parliament to clear the Army from the censure it thereby lies under, there
remains a brand of Ignominy upon this Army to Posterity: And those Soldiers
that have proceeded to act any thing in pursuance of their just Desires in that
Petition, or in Representation of their just Grievances thereupon; as also
those Officers that have any way concurred with,

(...)
