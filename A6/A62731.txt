To the Honorable MEMBERS OF THE House of Commons, etc. A SHORT Abstract for
the more effectual hindering Intelligence with France, by the full preventing
the Exportation of Wool, etc.
THAT its humbly submitted to you, that a Clause were put in the Bill before
you, touching the same, That no Persons, called Owlers, or their Agents, living
in the Counties of Kent and Sussex, upon any pretense whatsoever, Buy up or
Ingross any lesser or greater quantity of Wool; or any other Person, except
such that are Clothiers, Serge-makers, Wool-staplers, Felmongers, or any other
Person or Persons that have a Right, by Service of Time, to any Manufacturer of
Wool in those two Counties aforesaid, under a Forfeiture that shall be thought
fit, etc.

REASONS.
I. If no Owlers or Agents be suffered, as aforesaid, then it disappoints the
French in having our Wool, and gives no Encouragement for their Sloops and
Shallops to lie upon those Coasts, there being no Prey for them.

II. Intelligence cannot be kept up with France to that degree as it is,
neither will there be the opportunity for Traitors and disaffected Persons to
make their Escapes, 'they gettingover in Owl Boats.

III. It will in great measure preserve our Coasters, that are often taken by
the said Sloops and Shallops, either in going or coming to their respective
Ports.

IV. It would greatly satisfy the Trading part of the Manufacturers of Wool in
the Kingdom; with Merchants and others, whose Petitions, from several parts of
the said Kingdom, desire the same.

V. It would quicken Trade greatly in England, and be a means to raise Land, by
reason the Product thereof felling well:

VI. It would much lessen and weaken the French Interest, and reduce the
Subjects of that King, and make this Kingdom flourish.

All which Considerations are left to your Wisdom.
