THE KINGS MOST GRACIOUS MESSAGES FOR PEACE, AND A PERSONAL TREATY.

Published for His Peoples Satisfaction, that they may see and judge, whether
the foundation of the Commons Declaration, touching their Votes of no farther
Address to the KING, (viz. His Majesty's averseness to Peace) be just,
Rational and Religious.

PSALM. 21.7. The King trusts in the Lord, and through the mercy of the most
High he shall not be moved.

Printed in the Year, 1648.

TO THE READERS, of whatsoever Nation, Quality, or Condition.
Readers,
THe Papists teach, that Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion; but we believe,
of mischief rather. The world knew him not, says the Spirit, of our Savior,
for had they known, (as in another place) they would not have crucified the
Lord of Glory: and ^f Ignorance it was, they desired Barabbas, and denied
Jesus: I wot that through Ignorance ye did it (says the Apostle.) So many
people (in these times) have been busily mischievous against their King through
Ignorance, because they did not know Him: for had they known His Virtues and
His Graces, they would not (doubtless) have opposed Him, nor preferred such
(as they have done) before Him.

But as our Savior was, so has our Sovereign been, shaddowed much from vulgar
Eyes, by the black cloud of sclaunder and reproaches; which notwithstanding
was, and is removed from each, by the patient sufferings, gentle actions, and
gracious sayings of them both: so that what was hidden, did, and does (at last)
appear (maugre spite) to admiration. Verily this was the Son of God, (said
some of Christ in those days, who before had thought but meanly of him:) And
again, Never Man did, or spoke like him. So those men, who when time was had
low opinions of their King, are even forced to confess now, that Doubtless He
is a man of God, highly beloved of the Father, for never any (in the midst of
so much sorrow) suffered, acted, or writ better then He has done.

What Christ's Mind and Spirit was, (even unto those who studied His hurt) the
Gospel shows; and that all men might know the same) it is His Command to read
that: Search the Scriptures (says he) for they are they which do testify of
me. Indeed they are His Messages of Peace to mankind; they discover His love
and disposition to us, His strong desires of Reconciliation with us. And of
like nature or kind to them, are these ensuing Royal Papers; which (also) for
a like end, are here collected, published, and presented in one view: (that the
world might more fully see, and know the King.) They are Messages of Peace from
Him the wronged party, and may be (not unfitly) called His Majesty's Gospel to
His people: wherein they may most clearly view His Gracious Spirit, and His
temper; His gentle Nature and disposition, even toward those, who take pains
and pleasure both, to vex and grieve Him.

Had that Heathen Senate of old Rome read Christ's Gospel, and Him therein, His
power and readiness to save them, they would not (doubtless) have voted Him
no God: So it may be thought, if the Senate of these days, had read these
Messages of their Sovereign, with a right Eye; and observed His goodness
expressed in them, His ability and willingness of mind to pardon such as
themselves are: they would not have voted Him no King, or (which is little
less) no more Addresses to be made to Him. But (it seems now) through their
default in grace and light; His Majesty's Regality (like Christ's Divinity) must
depend upon the approbation of His own Creatures, (for such they are, as they
possess the place of Senators;) and must pass for current no longer in the
world, then they shall please to allow of it.

But does not this Act of theirs proclaim to all, they fear not God? it is His
command, that if a Brother, an equal, or common man be at odds with any, there
should be a going or sending to, and a receiving from, till a concord be
concluded: but these being at difference with their King, their Sovereign,
their Public Father, (to whom they owe all duty) have voted the quite
contrary; and Resolved upon the Question, that no more Addresses be made unto,
or received from Him: and supposing that this their opposition unto God, might
be noted to their shame; they have since that, advised upon an Ordinance that
none shall presume to speak against them, or to find fault at their so doing.
This is the Divinity of these times, or rather of these new Reformers, but we
refer their doings to the worlds censure, and themselves to the Judge of all
flesh.

Readers, You have here set before your Eyes, Piety and Conscience; Wisdom and
Humility; Majesty and Mercy: Bowels of Compassion, and Charity to Friends and
Enemies: Yea, what ever discovers a good King, and a perfect Christian; you
shall meet with it in these Messages of His Majesty: Behold them, Read them,
Consider of them: And let that sweet Spirit of God which shines and breathes in
them, be conveyed plentifully into your Hearts by them.

The Preface.
HAd Solomon lived in our days, He would scarce have said, there is no new
thing under the Sun, or that which is, has been, for surely that which now is,
has never been: the Sun never saw such a shameless and viperous Generation,
as the wicked world in this her last and worst Age has brought forth; Patience
cannot mention them, without a zealous passion against them: and should Christ
himself speak of them, He would say they were of their father the Devil, who
undoubtedly has put forth his whole strength to their begetting, by whose sole
help He hopes (under contrary pretenses and professions) for ever to disgrace,
(if not to ruinate) Christian verity in this Kingdom, to banish all Duty and
Charity from among us, to rob us of that Liberty which no people like us did
enjoy, and to keep us under the most cruel and unreasonable Bondage that ever
was, and so to make us (who were the Happiest) of all nations the most
miserable and despised.

To which ungodly ends, this sinful Brood have raised a most wicked war in
their own native Country, against their Sovereign, (the indulgent Father of it)
unto whom themselves had often sworn fidelity and Allegiance: nor has the
supreme Moderator of Heaven and Earth yet stopped them in their way, but (for the
due punishment of our sins, the full discovery of their incredible wickedness,
and of those admirable graces in the King) has suffered them rather to
prevail, prosper, and grow worse and worse these 7 years together: in which
interim or space of time, His sacred Majesty (though the wronged party)
imitating the Great and Good God, has often in his Commiseration and pity both
to us and them, (of our misery and their madness) sought Peace at their Hands,
who for no cause had broke the same; yea and offered more for the Purchase of
it, then was ever till now desired of any English King.

But they designing (as is now Evident) to inslave us, and settle themselves in
his Throne, have like deaf Adders stopped their Ears, and been most perverse unto
all desires of that nature: yea, and to prevent his sending them any more, have
now at length not only imprisoned his sacred Person, but also (as may be
affirmed) interdicted him all Humane Society, by voting no further Addresses to
be made unto Him, and forbidding all men, (under penalty of High Treason) to
receive, or bring any Message from Him, so tedious (it seems) to the Haters of
Peace, are motions thereunto, and so irksome is Reason to them who resolve to
Hear none.

But supposing in their black Policy, this Height of impiety, might somewhat
Startle the amazed world, who had not been acquainted with the like before,
they promised a satisfactory Declaration, wherein should be shown the Reasons
of so strange Votes and courses; upon which the seduced part of men grew big
with expectation, and looked for some new great mountain of Error to be
brought forth against the King, never yet seen or heard of: But behold, at last
what appeared; only a parcel of stale stuff, a new Heap of old tales without
proofs, which had been oftener told and confuted already, then there be Members
left in both Houses; so that the repetition of them on this occasion, is
confessed by those who were blind before, to be but an open discovery of an
impotent spite that wants nothing but matter to work upon: And so far, is this
Declaration from satisfying amazed minds, concerning those uncouth votes, that
it rather leaves them more astonished, the Ground or cause thereof being more
strange and impudent, then the votes themselves, viz. the Kings averseness unto
Peace, it begins thus:

How fruitless our former Addresses have been to the King, is so well known to
the world, that it may be expected we should now declare, why we made the last,
or so many before, rather then why we are resolved to make no more. And again
in the same page,

We have no less then 7 times (being never yet forced thereto) made such
Applications to the King, and tendered such Propositions, that might occasion
the world to judge, we have not only yeil^ed up our Wills and Affections, but
our Reason also and Judgment, for obtaining any true Peace or good
Accommodation. But it never yet pleased the King to accept of any tender fit
for us to make, nor yet to offer any fit for us to receive.

Had these men who thus speak, acted the Kings part, and He theirs* there might
have been much of truth, though little of Piety and manners in these
Expressions of their Sovereign: or had Affairs betwixt His Majesty and them
been agitated in a Corner, and not in the worlds Eye, perhaps by these so
confident aspersions of him, some ill suspicions might have risen in peoples
minds against him; but the case being as it is, and matters been acted as they
have, on the public Stage, we have cause to admire at their Hard foreheads.
Certainly did they not fancy us stark blind, they would not tell us it were
night a noone day: did they not think us given up to the strongest delusions
that ever were, they would not speak to us after this fashion: but from this
their Language, we shall learn this Lesson, That they who are not ashamed
publicly to Charge such a thing upon their King, so manifestly contrary to all
men's knowledge, will never blush to traduce him to the full Height, in matters
more secret, or less visible. This beginning of their Declaration (therefore)
does well instruct all people, how to believe them in the sequel of it.

These Brass-brow'd and unreverend Men, that so boldly affirm the world well
knows how fruitl^sse their former Addresses have been, etc. cannot show one
Address so qualified as they speak, ever made by them to the King, that proved
fruitless: they cannot name any one Act, wherein they denied their own Wills,
or discovered the least good Affection to their Sovereign, since the beginning
of these Divisions; nor can they instance in any one motion ever proceeding
from them unto His Majesty, and refused by Him, that had any favor of right
Reason, or relish of true Judgment in it: nay, have not themselves continually
slighted, and most unreverendly rejected what ever Messages of that nature have
been sent from him? did His Majesty ever demand any thing of them, that was not
His own by Law? nay, in order to Peace, did He ever ask so much as by Law was
due unto Him? did He not always recede from the same, to satisfy them, if
their guilt and perverseness had not made them incapable of Satisfaction?
Surely the King has not 7 times only, but rather 7 times seven within these 7
years, made such Applications to them, offered such tenders of mercy and
pardon, and of His own undoubted Rights and Privileges, as did (in very deed)
occasion the world to judge, that He had yielded up His will and Affections,
yea His Reason, Judgment, and all, for the obtaining of a good Accommodation:
but they would never yet please to accept of any; when He spoke to them of
Peace, they Hardened their Hearts against it, and made themselves ready to
Battle: these things they know we are able to demonstrate, being such as the
world has taken full notice of; and yet with what audaciousnesse do they
affirm the Contrary before the worlds face, to the Kings dis-honour, and their
own Commendation, (as they would have it?) But (it seems) Change is no Robbery
in their opinions; since they return to the King what is theirs, and apply unto
Him their own Conditions, in lieu of that Candor and righteousness which they
take from Him, to paint themselves withal, they think they have done very good
Justice. Our Savior Himself had to do with such persons, who could charge him
home with their own faults, and appropriate most favorably to themselves, that
Innocence and goodness which was truly His; they could accuse and sclaunder
His Holy Actions, and give a large good report of their own ill doings; whereby
(as He says) they spoke their Testimony to be untrue, and themselves Children
of the Father of Lies: so whosoever considers what these have writ must needs
conclude the like of them, even that Satan is in them of a truth.

But their Conceit (as appears) is, that the last word will get the day, and
credit enough to their sayings, and this they think they are sure of; for it is
fore-provided that His Majesty shall either not know, what they object, or if
He does, and has a mind to speak for Himself, He shall not be suffered; nor
must any man dare (under pain of High Treason) to bring from Him into public
view any Papers or Writings of what kind soever, though tending only to the
vindication of Himself from their base, vile, and ungodly sclaunders; it must
be sufficient to condemn Him, that they who thirst for His blood have thus
accused Him. And here is the wisdom of these Happy times, this is the Justice
of our blessed Reformers. Sure had they any Hope that the King were likely by
impertinent discourses, to Help their lame and barren cause with some
advantages, they would easily admit of a Treaty with Him, (what ere they say to
the Contrary:) or did they imagine His Royal Pen could speak any thing but
Innocence, truth, and Reason, they would be content to hear from it, upon this
their further provocation of it: but wholly despairing of such matters, they
have thought meet, to imprison both Him and His Pen too, which (they know)
would in a moment cast down this idle Cobweb, as it formerly has done others
of like nature, and they think to stop all men's mouths, by affirming the world
well knows How fruitless their former Addresses have been to the King.

But though His Majesty's Hands are thus tied, this Spiders web must not escape
brushing: before it had Hung 3 days, an Honest broom reached at it, a
wholesome Antidote came out against it, and made it appear to be as it is, fit
only for the draught or Dunghill; and almost daily since, some Loyal foot or
other, has been trampling on it: for Stones would surely move, and stir in
this case, if men should not.

But since none can speak so well as the King, and He is voted to speak no more,
and since their appeal is made to the worlds knowledge, it shall not be amiss,
for the world to look back upon what the King has said or done already, even
in Confutation of that here Charged upon Him, scil. His aversness unto Peace:
perhaps thereby alone, it will sufficiently appear, that of all sclaunderers
which ever were, these Declarers have deserved the name of the most impudent,
and most shameless.

We shall not need to look back so far as to the years 1642. and 43. or call to
mind His Majesty's unwillingnesse to war at first, His many Messages to prevent
the same, and to preserve peace, before it was broken; or to mention how
scornfully they were entertained, as effects only of His weakness, and
instances of His want of power to make resistance. Nor will we remember how by
force of Arms, they had kept him out of His town of Hull, taken His Militia and
Navy from Him, and raised an Army against Him, before He set up His Standerd in
His own defense against them (which His desire of Peace had prevailed with him
to take down again, and to recall his most just Declaration, so that their
unreverend and scandalous Libels against him might but likewise be recalled:
The Earls of Dorset and Southampton.
) nor yet how in those days his Messengers, men of High Nobility and great
Honor (against whom they had nothing to object but that employment) were not
suffered in person to declare their Message, (because it was for Peace) but
commanded to depart the town speedily. Nor how at other times they imprisoned
others that came to them on the same Errand, how they often neglected to return
Him any Answer at all, or perhaps in lieu thereof (after a months delay) they
would send Him a parcel of reproachful expressions, and peevish constructions
of what He had writ in the sincerity of His heart, and pity of Spirit for the
ensuing Miseries of His people; which notwithstanding He would still interpret,
and call, but mistakes, that He might not exasperate (if possible) their
ulcerated minds unto contention, though in very deed, they were no other then
High Sclaunders and studied Contempts. Nor will we call to mind how once in
particular His earnest pressing for peace by a second and third Message,
(before He had received Answer to a former,) did appear so intolerably
offensive unto them, that to teach Him to make an end of such motions, and to
prevent (if it might be) all further molestations from Him of that nature, they
fell the very next day (after their receipt thereof, having first committed His
Messenger) to accuse His Majesty's Royal Consort of High Treason.

But these things at so large a distance we need not remember; nor how his
Majesty after the often frustration of such His own endeavors for Peace, did
convene the loyal Lords and Commons at Oxford, to consult of a way to procure
that desired blessing; how they labored in vain about the same, and had their
Letters which they sent to that end cried up and down London streets in scorn,
under the Title of a Petition of the Prince of Wales, and Duke of York for
Peace. How in answer thereto, Papers full of Treason, sedition, and disloyalty
were sent unto them, together with that unlawful Covenant (which now
themselves deride at, as an Almanacke of last year, or occasional trick
devised at the present to cheat the Kingdom) for His Majesty and all in Oxford
to take: nor need we remember how all those Noble and Loyal men did under
their Hands attest (to all the world) His Majesty's earnest longings to have a
period put to these unkind divisions, which Himself also by his Actions did
always confirm, whose constant course it was, at the end of any Victory got by
him, or any remarkable defeat given to them, to send forth His Proclamations of
Mercy and tenders of pardon (which are still extant in many hands) on Condition
they would but at length be quiet and embrace peace, which they would never
consent unto, unless He would also yield to Justify their Iealousies, and to
condemn Himself as guilty of all they had Charged upon Him: And it is well
enough known that when ever He procured to have a Treaty with them (which was
but seldom) His Propositions were so much tending to their advantage, and his
own damage, that nothing disliked them more, then His moderation, which indeed
was the true cause of their continual backwardness unto Treaties, and also of
their strict Limitations to their Commissioners, when with much ado they were
obtained, (as is evident enough by the passages of that at Vxbridge:) for they
supposing the reasonableness of what they knew His Majesty desired, and the
unreasonablenesse of what themselves intended to ask, would be so apparent by
a free and open discussion, that a Peace thereby might happily be produced in
despite of them: wherefore their care was to prevent (if they could) any
Treaties at all, or else by devises to break them off, before they came to any
perfection; and then they would with all speed make a Declaration to the world,
wherein they would pretend fully to show, that His Majesty's demands had
neither Reason nor Justice, either in the matter or manner of them, but were
such as left the people no Hopes to see an End of their present Calamities.

But (as was said) we shall not need to look back so far for Helps to overthrow
the Groundwork of this their false building, we shall only remember the means
used by His Majesty for Peace, since His peoples Calamities are confessed
without dispute, to be solely continued by these Declarers; since the power
has been wholly in their Hands, and few or no forces pretending for the King
in appearance against them; (His Armies being for most part of the time
disbanded, and His Towns and Garrisons resigned.)

In a word, we shall present to the worlds review only those Messages for
Peace, sent from his Majesty in these two last years, since a little before He
laid down His Sword, and ceased from Action against them; whereby it will be
manifest enough, what little cause they have to speak as they do, in
Commendation of themselves and their own good natures; or to suggest of the
King, as if He were so unperswadable to this very day, that neither their own
sighs, and groans, and tears will incline Him to be quiet, nor the crying blood
of Fathers, Brothers, Children, and of many Hundred thousand freeborn Subjects
in three great Kingdoms can prevail with him to desist from Cruelty and
destruction. And then after this we shall desire to see what Evidence
themselves can allege for what they have said* we shall wish they would
produce the strong reasons they have used, to show those Humble addresses which
they have made, and do so much boast of; that they would let us Hear some or
their self-denying streins, affectionate expressions or devout Petitions, which
(as they infer) have so respectfully and tenderly flowed from them, so often,
and so long, that thereby the world (to whom they appeal) may Judge in this
case, betwixt their King and them: which if they are not able to do, no
question but what they have voted of Him, will be generally concluded of them,
viz. that they are worthy to be interdicted all Humane society, to have no more
Messages sent, or offers made unto them: nor any request or Petitions hereafter
received from them; And that the King should say to them, as God does to such
as they, Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hands,
and no man regarded, but have set at naught all my Councels, and slighted all
my motions, therefore when your fear comes as Desolation, and your
Destruction as a whirlewind, when distress and anguish is upon you, then you
shall call unto me, but I will not answer, you shall seek mercy from me, but
you shall not find it; you shall eat the fruit of your own ways, and be
filled with your own devises: As you have done, so shall it be done unto you.

His Majesty's most Gracious Messages for Peace, sent to the two Houses of
Parliament at Westminster since the 5. of Dec. 1645.
His Majesty's first Message.
CHARLES R.

HIs Majesty being deeply sensible of the Continuation of this bloody and
unnatural War, cannot think Himself discharged of the duty He owes to God,
or the affection and regard He has to the preservation of His People, without
the constant application of His earnest endeavors to find some expedient for
the speedy ending of these unhappy distractions, if that may be, does therefore
desire, That a Safe Conduct may be forthwith sent, for the Duke of Richmond,
the Earl of Southampton, John Ashburnham, and Ieffery Palmer Esquires, and
their Attendants, with Coaches, Horses, and other Accommodations for their
Journey to Westminster, during their stay there, and return when they shall
think fit. Whom His Majesty intends to send to the Lords and Commons assembled
in the Parliament of England at Westminster, and the Commissioners of the
Parliament of Scotland, furnished with such Propositions, as His Majesty is
confident will be the Foundation of a happy and well-grounded Peace.

Given at the Court at Oxford the 5. of December. 1645. For the Speaker of the
House of Peers pro tempore.

THis Message being received, a Letter was sent thereupon from the Speakers of
both Houses to Sir Thomas Glemham (the then Governor of Oxford) promising an
Answer to it with all convenient speed, which His Majesty expected with silence
accordingly ten days, and then solicites them again for the same thing, which
He had done before, as follows.

His Majesty's second Message.
CHARLES R.

HIs Majesty cannot but extremely wonder, that after so many Expressions on
your part, of a deep and seeming sense of the miseries of this afflicted
Kingdom, and of the dangers incident to His Person during the continuance of
this unnatural War, your many great and so often repeated Protestations, that
the raising of these Arms has been only for the necessary defense of Gods
true Religion, His Majesty's Honor, Safety and Prosperity, the Peace, Comfort
and Security of His People, you should delay a Safe Conduct to the persons
mentioned in His Majesty's Message of the fifth of this instant December, which
are to be sent unto you with Propositions for a well-grounded Peace: A thing so
far from having been denied at any times by His Majesty, whenever you have
desired the same, that He believes it has been seldom (if ever) practiced
among the most avowed and professed enemies, much less from Subjects to their
King. But His Majesty is resolved, that no discouragements whatsoever shall
make Him fail of His part, in doing His uttermost endeavors to put an end to
these Calamities, which if not in time prevented, must prove the ruin of this
unhappy Nation; And therefore does once again desire, That a safe Conduct may
be forthwith sent for those persons expressed in His former Message, and does
therefore Conjure you, as you will answer to Almighty God, in that day when he
shall make inquisition for all the Blood that has and may yet be spilt in this
unnatural War, as you tender the preservation and establishment of the true
Religion; by all the Bonds of Duty and Allegiance to your King, or compassion
to your bleeding, and unhappy Country, and of Charity to your selves, that you
dispose your hearts to a true sense, and employ all your faculties in a more
serious endeavor, together with His Majesty, to set a speedy end to these
wasting Divisions, and then He shall not doubt, but that God will yet again
give the blessing of Peace to this distracted Kingdom.

Given at the Court at Oxford, the 15. of December, 1645. For the Speaker of
the House of Peers pro tempore.

THis Message seconding the former, spoke (as many others had done) His
Majesty's earnestness for Peace; and how much affected He was with his peoples
miseries in the want of it: but it is thought meet (by them to whom it is sent)
to make His Heart more sick, by delaying His hopes; and therefore (neglecting
their own promise of returning an Answer with all convenient speed) they cause
him to wait ten days longer, at the end of which time they seemed as far from
remembering either Him, or themselves as at the beginning: which His Majesty
observing, and withal conceiving this unwillingnes in them to admit of Peace,
might be for that He had motioned to send it by others, apprehended because
they had (in pretense at least) fought so long to enjoy His presence, that if
himself should carry it, they would undoubtedly both embrace that, and
reverence Him; and thereupon offers to go unto them, and to Treat personally
with them about the same: yea and to make the surer way to Himself with this
great Blessing (in the behalf of His people) He resolves to buy their consent,
if he cannot beg it, by receding so much from His own rights, as none of His
Predecessors ever did: for supposing the point of their own security, to be
the maine obstacle in the Business; He offers to part with the Militia it self
out of His own Hands for a season: and to this purpose, omitting all
Expostulations for their so High neglect, and contempt of Him, in not answering
His former Messages; He writes to them, as follows:

His Majesty's third Message.
CHARLES R.

NOtwithstanding the strange and unexpected delays (which can be presidented
by no former times) to His Majesty's two former Messages, His Majesty will lay
aside all Expostulations, as rather serving to lose time, then to contribute
any remedy to the evils, which (for the present) do afflict this distracted
Kingdom; Therefore without farther Preamble, His Majesty thinks it most
necessary to send these Propositions this way, which He intended to do by the
Persons mentioned in His former Messages, though He well knows the great
disadvantage, which Overtures of this kind have, by the want of being
accompanied by wel-instructed Messengers.

His Majesty conceiving that the former Treaties have hitherto proved
ineffectuall, chiefly for want of power in those persons that Treated, as
likewise, because those from whom their power was derived (not possibly having
the particular informations of every several debate) could not give so clear a
Judgment as was requisite in so important a business; If therefore His Majesty
may have the engagement of the two Houses of Parliament at Westminster, the
Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland, the Major, Aldermen,
Common Counsel, and Militia of London, of the chief Commanders in Sir Thomas
Fairfax's Army, as also those in the Scots Army, for His Majesty's free and
safe coming to, and abode in London or Westminster, (with such of His Servants
now attending Him, and their Followers, not exceeding in all the number of 300)
for the space of forty days, and after the said time for his free and safe
repair to any of His Garrisons of Oxford, Worcester, or Newark, (which His
Majesty shall nominate at any time before His going from London or Westminster)
His Majesty propounds to have a Personal Treaty with the two Houses of
Parliament at Westminster, and the Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland,
upon all matters which may conduce to the restoring of Peace and happiness to
these miserably distracted Kingdoms; And to begin with the three Heads which
were Treated on at Uxbridge. And for the better clearing of His Majesty's
earnest and sincere intentions of putting an end to these unnatural
Distractions, (knowing that point of security may prove the greatest obstacle
to this most blessed work) His Majesty therefore Declares, That He is willing
to commit the great Trust of the Militia of this Kingdom, for such time, and
with such Powers, as are expressed in the Paper delivered by His Majesty's
Commissioners at Uxbridge, the 6. of February last, to these Persons following,
viz. The Lord Privy Seal, the Duke of Richmond, the Marquess of Hertford, the
Marquess of Dorchester, the Earl of Dorset, Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of
Northumberland, the Earl of Essex, Earl of Southhampton, Earl of Pembroke, Earl
of Salisbury, Earl of Manchester, Earl of Warwick, Earl of Denbigh, Earl of
Chichester, Lord Say, Lord Seymour, Lord Lucas, Lord Lexington, Mr. Denzill
Hollis, Mr. Pierrepoint, Mr. Henry Bellasis, Mr. Richard Spencer, Sir Thomas
Fairfax, Master John Ashburnham, Sir Gervas Clifton, Sir Henry Vane junior, Mr.
Robert Wallop, Mr. Thomas Chichely, Master Oliver Cromwell, and Mr. Philip
Skippon, supposing that these are Persons against whom there can be no just
exception: But if this does not satisfy, then His Majesty offers to name the
one half, and leave the other to the election of the two Houses of Parliament
at Westminster, with the Powers and Limitations before mentioned.

Thus His Majesty calls God and the World to witness, of His sincere
Intentions and real Endeavors, for the composing and settling of these
miserable Distractions, which He doubts not, but by the blessing of God, will
soon be put to a happy Conclusion, if this His Majesty's offer be accepted;
Otherwise He leaves all the World to Judge, who are the Continuers of this
unnatural War. And therefore He once more Conjures you, by all the Bonds of
Duty you owe to God and your King, to have so great a Compassion on the
bleeding and miserable Estate of your Country, That you join your most serious
and hearty Endeavors with His Majesty, to put a happy and speedy end to these
present Miseries.

Given at the Court at Oxford the 26 of December, 1645. For the Speaker of the
House of Peers pro tempore, To be Communicated to the two Houses of Parliament
at Westminster, and to the Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland.

WHile this Message was in the way of passage to them, this ensuing Paper
(which seems to relate to the two former) comes from them, after 20 days
serious Consideration, (as themselves speak) for so long the Lords and Commons
of the Parliament of England, together with the Commissioners of the Parliament
of Scotland, were deep in consultation about the framing of it: it conteins
only two things; a Commendation of themselves; and a Denial of the Kings
request, for a safe Conduct unto His Commissioners to Treat for Peace: it is
this which follows:

May it please your Majesty,
THe Lords and Commons Assembled in the Parliament of England at Westminster,
have received your Letters of the fifth and fifteenth of this instant December,
and having, together with the Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland,
taken the same into their serious consideration, do humbly return this Answer.

They have in all their Actions manifested to Your Majesty and the World, their
sincere and earnest desires, that a safe and well grounded Peace might be
settled in Your three Kingdoms, and for the obtaining so great a Blessing, shall
ever pray to God, and use their utmost endeavors, and beseech Your Majesty to
believe; that their not sending a more speedy Answer, has not proceeded from
any intention to retard the means of putting an end to these present Calamities
by a happy Peace, but has been occasioned by the Considerations and Debates
necessary in a business of so great importance, wherein both Kingdoms are so
much concerned.

As to Your Majesty's desire of a safe Conduct for the coming hither of the
Duke of Richmond, the Earl of Southampton, John Ashburnham and Jeffrey Palmer
Esquires, with Propositions to be the foundation of a happy and well grounded
Peace, They finding that former Treaties have been made use of for other ends
under the pretense of Peace, and have proved delatory, and unsuccesfull, cannot
give way to a safe Conduct according to Your Majesty's desire; But both Houses
of the Parliament of England, having now under their Consideration Propositions
and Bills for the settling of a safe and well grounded Peace, which are speedily
to be communicated to the Commissioners of the Kingdom of Scotland, do resolve
after mutual agreement of both Kingdoms to present them with all speed to Your
Majesty.

Gray of Wark Speaker of the House of Peers pro tempore. William Lenthall
Speaker of the House of Commons.
Westminster the 25. December, 1645.

WE have read of a proud Pope, that made His Lord the Emperor seeking for a
Treaty with Him, wait three days before he would grant it: but never till this
Age was it heard or read, that Humble and Loyal Subjects (as these men call
themselves) did force their Sovereign to wait twenty days for an Answer to a
like request, and then return Him a flat denial: But His majesty had been too
long, and too well acquainted with this perverseness of theirs; and being (in
His measure) like Him whose Vicegerent He is, of great patience and
long-suffering, passes by again, this their unreverend Carriage and demeanor
toward Him, without any expostulation about the same, being ever careful, to
shun and avoid what might in likelihood hinder His pious design, of obtaining
Peace unto his people: and therefore presses again His last motion in his
third Message for a personal Treaty in these words,

His Majesty's fourth Message.
CHARLES R.

ALthough the Message sent by Sir Peter Killegrew, may justly require an
expostulatory Answer, yet His Majesty lays that aside, as not so proper for
His present Endeavors; leaving all the World to judge, whether His Proposition
for a Personal Treaty, or the flat denial of a safe Conduct for Persons to
begin a Treaty, be greater signs of a real Intention to Peace; and shall now
only insist upon His former Message of the 26 of this December. That upon His
repair to Westminster, He doubts not but so to join His Endeavors with His
two Houses of Parliament, as to give just satisfaction, not only concerning
the business of Ireland, but also for the settling of a way for the payment of
the Public Debts, as well to the Scots, and to the City of London, as others.
And as already He has shown a fair way for the settling of the Militia, so He
shall carefully Endeavor in all other Particulars, that none shall have cause
to complain for want of security, whereby just Jealousies may arise to hinder
the continuance of the desired Peace. And certainly this Proposition of a
Personal Treaty could never have entered into His Majesty's Thoughts, if He had
not resolved to make apparent to all the World, that the Public good and Peace
of this Kingdom, is far dearer to Him then the respect of any particular
Interest. Wherefore none can oppose this Motion, without a manifest
demonstration, that He particularly envies His Majesty should be the chief
Author in so blessed a Work, besides the declaring Himself a direct opposer of
the happy Peace of these Nations. To conclude, whosoever will not be ashamed,
that His fair and specious Protestations should be brought to a true and
Public Test; and those who have a real sense, and do truly commiserate the
miseries of their bleeding Country, let them speedily and cheerfully embrace
His Majesty's Proposition for His Personal Treaty at Westminster, which, by
the blessing of God, will undoubtedly to these now distracted Kingdoms,
restore the happiness of a long wished for, and lasting Peace.

Given at the Court at Oxford, the 29 day of December, 1645. For the Speaker of
the House of Peers pro tempore, to be Communicated to the two Houses of
Parlialiament at Westminster, and the Commissioners of the Parliament of
Scotland.

THis Message (as it seems) was very unpleasing, and spoke the King very
troublesome, in being so importunate for Peace, and to come amongst them, whose
presence next to that of God, would be the greatest torment to them: Wherefore
to let him know, that Ambassadors for Peace are never welcome, but to those
that love it; and to give him a guess what Himself should find if He came
within their reach, they kept His Messenger as their Prisoner, and returned
silence to His Message: hereupon His Majesty having waited their Leisure full
twenty days longer ( viz. from Dec. 26. to Ian. 15.) and hearing no news of
either, sends to inquire after His Trumpet, and withal moves again to the same
purpose as before, enlarging His offers for what He desires, and recedes
further yet from His own Rights, for His Peoples quiet, in these words:

His Majesty's fifth Message.
CHARLES R.

BUt that these are times, wherein nothing is strange; it were a thing much to
be marvailed at, what should cause this unparalleled long detention of His
Majesty's Trumpet, sent with His Gracious Message of the 26 of December last;
Peace being the only Subject of it, and His Majesty's Personal Treaty, the
means proposed for it. And it were almost as great a wonder, that His Majesty
should be so long from inquiring after it, if that the hourly expectation
thereof, had not, in some measure satisfied His Impatience: But let His Majesty
by His long silence, should condemn Himself of Carelessness in that, which so
much concerns the good of all His People, He thinks it high time to inquire
after His said Trumpeter; For since all men who pretend any goodness, must
desire Peace; and that all men know Treaties to be the best and most Christian
way to procure it, and there being as little question, that His Majesty's
Personal Presence in it, is the likeliest way to bring it to a happy Issue; He
judges there must be some strange variety of accidents, which causes this most
tedious delay; wherefore His Majesty earnestly desires to have a speedy Account
of His former Message, the subject whereof is Peace, and the means His
Personal presence at Westminster, where the Government of the Church being
settled, as it was in the times of the happy and glorious Reigns of Queen
Elizabeth and King James, and full Liberty for the ease of their Consciences,
who will not communicate in that Service established by Law, and likewise for
the free and public use of the Directory (prescribed, and by Command of the
two Houses of Parliament, now practiced in some parts of the City of London) to
such as shall desire to use the same, and all Forces being agreed to be
Disbanded, His Majesty will then forthwith (as He has in His Message of the 29
of December last, already offered) join with His two Houses of Parliament, in
settling some way for the payment of the public Debts to His Scots Subjects,
the City of London, and others: And His Majesty having proposed a fair way, for
the settling of the Militia, which now by this long delay, seems not to be
thought sufficient security: His Majesty (to show how really He will employ
Himself at His coming to Westminster) for making this a lasting Peace, and
taking away all jealousies, (how groundless soever) will endeavor upon debate
with His two Houses, so to dispose of it (as likewise of the business of
Ireland) as may give to them and both Kingdoms just satisfaction; not doubting
also, but to give good contentment to His two Houses of Parliament in the
choice of the Lord Admiral, the Officers of State and others, if His two
Houses, by their ready inclinations to Peace shall give Him encouragement
thereunto. Thus His Majesty having taken occasion by His just impatience so to
explain His intentions, that no man can doubt of a happy Issue to this
succeeding Treaty: If now, there shall be so much as a delay of the same, He
calls God and the World to witness, who they are, that not only hinder, but
reject this Kingdoms future happiness, It being so much the stranger, that His
Majesty's coming to Westminster, (which was first the greatest pretense for
taking up Arms) should be so much as delayed, much less not accepted or
refused; But His Majesty hopes, that God will no longer suffer the malice of
Wicked men to hinder the Peace of this too much afflicted Kingdom.

Given at the Court at Oxford, the 15 of January, 1645. For the Speaker of the
House of Peers pro tempore, To be Communicated to the two Houses of Parliament
at Westminster, and the Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland.

CAn Subjects desire more, or to have their King offer more, then is here
tendered? sure no good Christian Subjects can desire so much, or be content to
have their King recede so far from Himself for their sakes: But by this, and
the preceding Messages, we see what the King has bidden for the purchase of
Peace, and a Treaty with them; now we shall have a glimpse of what they thought
fit to ask of Him for their leave to let Him come, and speak with them, after
they had fasted, prayed, and fought five years to fetch Him to His Parliament:
for immediately after His sending this last most gracious Message, there came
to His Majesty's hands as the effect of His Four former, and the reward of His
forty days waiting this ensuing Paper, which contains only a parcel of such
scandalous and cross speeches, as shameless women are wont to cast up against
those they rail upon, and mean to live in Contention with, which
notwithstanding the world (supposed to be as void of Reason, as themselves are
of Religion) must interpret an Humble Address unto His Majesty for Peace,
because it begins with May it please your Majesty, we your Humble and Loyal
Subjects, for it is one of those Addresses, which (in the beginning of their
late Declaration) they say the world well knows to have been so fruitless,
wherein they have yielded up their wills, Affections, Reason, Judgment, and all
for obtaining a true peace or good Accommodation, it follows in these very
words,

May it please your Majesty,
WE Your Humble and Loyal Subjects of both Kingdoms, have received Your
Letters of the 26 and 29 of December last; unto which we humbly return this
Answer.

That there has been no delay on our parts, but what was necessary in a
business of so great consequence, as is expressed in our former Letter to Your
Majesty.

Concerning the personal Treaty desired by Your Majesty, There having been so
much innocent blood of Your good Subjects shed in this War, by Your Majesty's
Commands and Commissions, Irish Rebels brought over into both Kingdoms, and
endeavors to bring over more into both of them, as also Forces from Foreign
parts; Your Majesty being in Arms in these parts, the Prince in the head of an
Army in the West, diverse Towns made Garrisons, and kept in Hostility by Your
Majesty against the Parliament of England: There being also Forces in Scotland
against that Parliament and Kingdom by Your Majesty's Commission: The War in
Ireland fomented and prolonged by Your Majesty, whereby the three Kingdoms are
brought near to utter ruin and destruction. We conceive, That until
satisfaction and security be first given to both your Kingdoms, Your Majesty's
coming hither cannot be convenient, nor by us assented unto. Neither can we
apprehend it a means conducing to Peace, That Your Majesty should come to Your
Parliament for a few days, with any thoughts of leaving it; especially with
intentions of returning to Hostility against it. And We do observe, That Your
Majesty desires the Engagement, not only of the Parliaments, but of the Lord
Mayor, Aldermen, Common Council, and Militia of the City of London, the chief
Commanders of Sir Thomas Fairfax's Army, and those of the Scots Army, which is
against the Privileges and Honor of the Parliaments, those being joined with
them, who are subject and subordinate to their Authority.

That which Your Majesty against the freedom of the Parliaments inforces in
both Your Letters with many earnest expressions, as if in no other way then
that propounded by Your Majesty, the Peace of Your Kingdoms could be
established, Your Majesty may please to remember, that in Our last Letter, We
did Declare, That Propositions from both Kingdoms were speedily to be sent to
Your Majesty, which We conceive to be the only way for attaining a happy and
well-grounded Peace, and Your Majesty's assent unto those Propositions, will be
an effectual means for giving satisfaction and security to Your Kingdoms:
will assure a firm Union between the two Kingdoms, as much desired by each
other as for themselves; And settle Religion and secure the Peace of the
Kingdom of Scotland, whereof neither is so much as mentioned in Your Majesty's
Letters.

And in proceeding according to these just and necessary grounds for the
putting an end to the bleeding Calamities of these Nations, Your Majesty may
have the Glory to be a Principal Instrument in so happy a Work; and We
(however mis-interpreted) shall approve our selves to God and the world, to be
real and sincere in seeking a safe and welgrounded Peace.

Westminster, 13. Jan. 1645. Signed in the name and by warrant of the
Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland. BALMERINOTH. Gray of Wark, Speaker
of the House of Peers pro tempore. William Lenthall, Speaker of the House of
Commons.
For Your Majesty.

THeir silence was bad, and showed great insolency, but their Language is far
worse, and speaks much more, for their style and matter in this Paper declares
them to be men most unreasonable, even such as the Apostle prays God to be
delivered from, and shows clearly on which side the obstruction to peace lies:
we see herein upon what Conditions the King might have been admitted (after so
many Messages) into the presence of His Humble and Loyal Subjects: if He would
but have owned the guilt of that innocent blood themselves had shed, bin
content to be dawbed with their crimes, laid down His Arms, given up His
Garrisons, called in His Commissions, deserted His Friends, and delivered up
Himself absolutely without any security into their Hands, with such a
submission as they should prescribe, which should have been no other, then
might have spoke His approbation of all they have said or done against Himself
and this Kingdom to be just and right; then His Humble and Loyal Subjects
would have vouchsafed to cast a look upon Him, and deigned so far as to have
spoke a word with him.

Herein also besides the Conditions of a Treaty are discovered diverse faults in
His Majesty's late Messages, which neither Himself nor any other was able to
have discerned, but the two Parliaments of England and Scotland after a
diligent search, having sat close some weeks about it, (for they were not idle
all the 40 days of the Kings waiting) did in their deep wisdoms descry and
find them out, and then thought fit (that their Sovereign might not sleep in
His sins) to admonish His Majesty of them: as

1. His requiring of them engagement for His own security if He came amongst
them, which was a great error and mistake in Him, for though He be a David,
and a man after Gods own heart, yet they are not subjects of the same stamp as
David's were, who thought their King worth ten thousand of themselves.

2. This request of His, was (in their judgments) against the Privilege and
Honor of Parliament, for the special Privilege of this Parliament, or rather
the swaying faction in the same, is to destroy if they can, and not to preserve
the King at all.

3. His mentioning the Mayor, Alderm^n, Common Council, and Militia of the
City, (as if He believed Himself to have any interest in them, and that they
were concerned to engage for His security) they give Him to understand, was
another grand mistake in Him; for all they, together with Sir Thomas Fairfax
his Army, and the Scots too, are their subjects and not His, and subordinate to
their Authority, and therefore for Him to expect any engagement for safety from
any of them, was directly also (in their sense) against the Honor and
Privilege of Parliament.

Nay 4. they give His Majesty to know, that He had not only sinned thus,
against the Honor and Privilege of Parliament, but also against the very
freedom of it, by His propounding with so many earnest expressions a Personal
Treaty, as the way to a Peace; which they interpret no other then a plain
enforcement upon the Liberty of Parliament, or a violent rape upon their
wisdom; as if they had not Brains enough, to find out some other way, then that
was which His Majesty had propounded: But truly (with their favor) this Error
might more prudently have been passed by, and the aggravation of it omitted;
had they but remembered how often themselves had told the world, that all their
fighting was but to bring the King home from His evil Counselors, to Treat
in Person with His Parliament: for what may the world now think of these wise
men? may they not liken them to little Children, who in a cross peevish
humor, will none of that thing when offered to them, but throw it away, which
before they had cried and roared for? the old and true way to a Peace between
different parties, has always been by Treaty, and so was it hitherto judged
by these men, (as themselves told us) but now they dislike it, only because the
King propounds it: And another way, they have devised, and that must be by
Propositions of their own making; which by this their Preface are promised to
be such as Benhadad sent to the King of Israel, neither good for Him, nor for
His people, but destructive unto both.

But His sacred Majesty, the true mirror of wisdom, meekness, and patience,
receiving from them (after diverse Messages and forty days waiting) only this
reproachful Paper, (which was able to stir passion in a very Moses) does send
back on the very same day, without returning one word of ill Language, this
ensuing Answer:

His Majesty's sixth Message.
CHARLES R.

HIs Majesty thinks not fit now to answer those aspersions which are returned
as arguments for His not admittance to Westminster for a Personal Treaty,
because it would enforce a style not suitable to His end, it being the Peace of
these miserable Kingdoms: yet thus much He cannot but say to those who have
sent Him this Answer, That if they had considered what they have done
themselves in occasioning the shedding of so much innocent blood, by
withdrawing themselves from their duty to Him, in a time when He had granted so
much to His Subjects, and in violating the known Laws of the Kingdom to draw
an exorbitant power to themselves over their fellow Subjects, (to say no more
to do as they have done) they could not have given such a false character of
His Majesty's actions. Wherefore His Majesty must now remember them, that
having some hours before His receiving of their last Paper of the 13. of Ian.
sent another Message to them of the 15. wherein by diverse particulars He
inlargeth Himself to show the reality of His endeavors for Peace by His desired
personal Treaty (which He still conceives to be the likeliest way to attain to
that blessed end) He thinks fit by this Message to call for an Answer to that,
and indeed to all the former. For certainly no rational man can think their
last Paper can be any Answer to His former demands, the scope of it being, that
because there is a War, therefore there should be no Treaty for Peace. And is
it possible to expect that the Propositions mentioned should be the grounds of
a Lasting Peace, when the Persons that send them will not endure to hear their
own King speak? But whatever the success has been of His Majesty's former
Messages, or how small soever His hopes are of a better, considering the high
strain of those who deal with His Majesty, yet He will neither want fatherly
bowels to His Subjects in general, nor will He forget that God has appointed
Him for their King with whom He Treats. Wherefore He now demands a speedy
Answer to His last and former Messages.

Given at our Court at Oxon this 17. of Jan. 1645. For the Speaker of the House
of Peers pro tempore, to be communicated, etc.

THese earnest desires of His Majesty for a speedy Answer shall nothing prevail
with them to hasten the same, for His unparalled meekness in passing by such
unheard of Affronts, without return of any passionate expression, is so high a
vexation to their black and ungodly souls, that they resolve in themselves to
make Him wait above three times forty days longer now, before He shall get a
word more from them, let Him send as often as He will to solicit for it: which
purposed contempt though His Majesty in His Candor and Charity did not (happily)
at that present fancy of them; yet being too well acquainted with their
dispositions, He conceived they might make some ill use among His People, of
His silence to their impediments objected against the Personal Treaty
propounded by Him; and therefore thought meet seven days after to speak
somewhat in Confutation of those their frivolous Arguments, and again to urge
the thing; as the only likely way of settling Peace unto His People; who from
hence may observe, that no rudeness or insolency toward Him, nor unjust
aspersions of Him, are able to divert Him from pursuing the means of their
welfare: His words are these,

His Majesty's seventh Message.
CHARLES R.

THe procuring Peace to these Kingdoms by Treaty, is so much desired by His
Majesty, that no unjust aspersions whatsoever, or any other discouragements
shall make Him desist from doing His endeavor therein, until He shall see it
altogether impossible: and therefore has thought fitting so far only to make
reply to that Paper or Answer which He has received of the 13 of this instant
Ian. as may take away those Objections which are made against His Majesty's
coming to Westminster, expecting still an Answer to His Messages of the 15, and
17. which He hopes by this time have begotten better thoughts and resolutions,
in the Members of both Houses. And first therefore, Whereas in the said last
Paper it is objected as an impediment to His Majesty's personal Treaty, that
much innocent blood has been shed in this War, by His Majesty's Commissions,
etc. He will not now dispute (it being apparent to all the World by whom this
blood has been spilt) but rather presses that there should be no more: and
(to that end only) He has desired this personal Treaty, as judging it the
most immediate means to abolish so many horrid confusions in all His Kingdoms.
And it is no argument, to say, That there shall be no such personal Treaty,
because there have been Wars, it being a strong inducement to have such a
Treaty to put an end to the War. Secondly, that there should be no such
personal Treaty, because some of His Irish Subjects have repaired to His
assistance in it, seems an argument altogether as strange as the other; as
always urging that there should be no Physic, because the party is sick: And
in this particular it has been often observed unto them, that those, whom they
call Irish, who have so expressed their Loyalty to their Sovereign, were
indeed (for the most part) such English Protestants, as had been formerly sent
into Ireland by the two Houses, impossibilitated to stay there any longer by
the neglect of those that sent them thither, who should there have better
provided for them. And for any Foreign forces, it is too apparent that their
Armies have swarmed with them, when His Majesty has had very few or none. And
whereas, for a third impediment, it is alleged that the Prince is in the head
of an Army in the West, and that there are diverse Garrisons still kept in his
Majesty's obedience, and that there are Forces in Scotland; it must be as much
confessed, as that as yet there is no peace; and therefore it is desired, that
by such a personal Treaty, all these impediments may be removed. And it is not
here amiss to put them in mind, how long since His Majesty did press a
disbanding of all Forces on both sides; the refusing whereof, has been the
cause of this objection. And whereas exception is taken, that there is a time
limited in the Proposition for His Majesty's personal Treaty, thereupon
inferring, that He should again return to Hostility, His Majesty protests
that He seeks this Treaty to avoid future Hostility, and to procure a lasting
peace, and if He can meet with like inclinations to Peace in those He desires
to Treat with, He will bring such affections and resolutions in Himself, as
shall end all these unhappy bloody differences. As for those engagements which
His Majesty has desired for His security, whosoever shall call to mind the
particular occasions that enforced His Majesty to leave His City of London and
Westminster, will judge His demand very reasonable and necessary for His
safety. But He no way conceives how the L. Major, Aldermen, Common Council,
and Militia of London, were either subject or subordinate to that Authority
which is alleged, as knowing neither Law nor practice for it: and if the two
Armies be, He believes it is more then can be paralleled by any former times in
this Kingdom. Nor can His Majesty understand how His Majesty's seeking of a
Personal Security can be any breach of Privilege: it being likely to be
infringed by hindering His Majesty from coming freely to His two Houses. As for
the Objection that His Majesty omitted to mention the settling Religion, and
securing the Peace of His Native Kingdom, His Majesty declares, that He
conceives that it was included in His former, and has been particularly
mentioned in his latter Message of the 15 present. But, for their better
satisfaction, he again expresses that it was, and ever shall be, both his
meaning and endeavor in this Treaty desired; and it seems to him very clear,
that there is no way for a final ending of such distractions as afflict this
Kingdom, but either by Treaty or Conquest, the latter of which his Majesty
hopes none will have the impudency or impiety to wish for: and for the former,
if his Personal assistance in it be not the most likely way, let any
reasonable man judge: when by that means not only all unnecessary delays will
be removed, but even the greatest difficulties made easy. And therefore he
does now again earnestly insist upon that proposition, expecting to have a
better answer upon mature consideration. And can it be imagined that any
Propositions will be so effectual, being formed before a personal Treaty, as
such as are framed and propounded upon a full debate on both sides? Wherefore
his Majesty, who is most concerned in the good of his People, and is most
desirous to restore peace and happiness to his three Kingdoms, does again
instantly desire an Answer to his said former Messages, to which he has
hitherto received none.

Given at our Court at Oxon the 24. of Jan. 1645. To the Speaker of the House
of Peers pro tempore, to be communicated to the two Houses of Parliament at
Westminster, and to the Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland.

FEw that ventured their lives to fetch home the King (at the instigation of
these men) or that heard their Preachers pray so often, that God would incline
His Majesty's heart to come unto His Parliament, would ever have believed, that
He should thus be put to plead for His own admittance amongst them, (who
pretended to be so fond of His Company;) or to Answer such cavils against the
same, as He has here done, if they had not seen them objected under their own
Hands: nor would any have been persuaded (had there not been somewhat extant to
evidence the same) that these men could (after all this) have affirmed, that
themselves had yielded up not only their wills and Affections, but also their
reason and judgment for obtaining a good Accommodation with the King: but now
it is manifest who they are that have abused, gulled, and deceived the world;
and who have been the only obstructers unto Peace, and most perfect Enemies
thereunto: And yet it is no mervaile, that the wickedness of these notorious
men was too deep and high for vulgar reaches, seeing His Majesty Himself after
all His experience, (being still straightened in spirit by His own Charity and
goodness) was not yet able to fadome the same, at His sending this seventh
Message; as may appear by His saying therein, that He Hopes none will have that
impudency and impiety, as to wish an end to the distractions of this Kingdom,
rather by Conquest then by Treaty: for in very deed (as all the world are now
persuaded since the publishing of their late Declaration) these men have had
that impudency and impiety in them, even from the beginning, not only to wish,
but also to endeavor the same; therefore in vain did His Majesty (as he since
has found) by this again, so instantly desire an Answer to His former Messages
for a personal meeting: And yet hoping (at least) that importunity might
prevail with these unrighteous Judges, (though entreaties will not) as it once
did with one. that feared neither God nor Man, He resolves to follow them still
with the same motion, which five days after He does, and that upon this
occasion.

His Majesty was informed of the Earl of Glamorgans unwarranted Agitation in
Ireland, and knowing that the manner of His Humble and Loyal Subjects at
Westminster, was to Honor Him, by heaping on Him the burden of others faults;
He thinks it pious and meet to endeavor to keep them from that sin, by giving
them a speedy notice of the said Earls doings, and of his own absolute dislike
of the same, which He evidences by His full approbation of that course which by
Marquess Ormond, and L. Digby was taken against him, Protesting solemnly that
he never had knowledge of any such capitulation or Treaty til He heard of the
Earls Arrest and restraint for making the same; disavowing the Articles by Him,
concluded and signed, as destructive both to Church and State, repugnant to His
Majesty's public professions and known resolutions, and so hazardous to the
blemishing His Reputation; and giving Commandment to the Lord Lieutenant and
Council of that Kingdom, to proceed against the said Earl, for this His grand
offense, committed out of falsnesse, presumption, or folly.

And after this, His Majesty falls again to His old work of importuning a
Treaty for Peace, which He urges upon them, with renewed promises, larger
concessions, greater engagements of Himself, and further Explanations of His
sincere intentions to trust them, to pardon them, to secure them, let the world
read this which follows, and then judge, if any Heart that intends to
acknowledge a King can desire more.

His Majesty's eighth Message.
CHARLES R.

HIs Majesty having received Information from the Lord Lieutenant and Council
in Ireland; That the Earl of Glamorgan has, without His, or their directions
or privity, entered into a Treaty with some Commissioners on the Roman
Catholic Party there, and also drawn up and agreed unto certain Articles with
the said Commissioners, highly derogatory to his Majesty's honor and Royal
Dignity, and most prejudicial unto the Protestant Religion and Church there in
Ireland: Whereupon the said Earl of Glamorgan is arrested, upon suspicion of
High Treason, and imprisoned by the said Lord Lieutenant and Council, at the
instance and by the Impeachment of the L. Dighby, who (by reason of his Place
and former Employment in these Affairs) does best know how contrary that
Proceeding of the said Earl has been to his Majesty's Intentions and
Directions, and what great prejudice it might bring to his Affairs, if those
Proceedings of the Earl of Glamorgan, should be any ways understood to have
been done by the directions, liking or approbation of his Majesty.

His Majesty, having in his former Messages for a Personal Treaty offered to
give contentment to his two Houses in the Business of Ireland; has now
thought fitting, the better to show his clear Intentions, and to give
satisfaction to his said Houses of Parliament, and the rest of his Subjects in
all his Kingdoms; to send this Declaration to his said Houses containing the
whole truth of the business, which is

That the Earl of Glamorgan having made offer unto Him to raise Forces in the
Kingdom of Ireland, and to Conduct them into England for His Majesty's Service,
had a Commission to that purpose, and to that purpose only.

That he had no Commission at all to Treat of any thing else, without the
privity and directions of the Lord Lieutenant, much less to Capitulate any
thing concerning Religion, or any Propriety, belonging either to Church or
Laity.

That it clearly appears by the Lord Lieutenants Proceedings with the said
Earl, That he had no notice at all of what the said Earl had Treated and
pretended to have capitulated with the Irish, until by accident it came to his
knowledge.

And His Majesty does Protest, That until such time as He had advertisement,
that the Person of the said Earl of Glamorgan was Arrested and restrained, as
is abovesaid, He never heard, nor had any kind of notice, that the said Earl
had entered into any kind of Treaty or Capitulation with those Irish
Commissioners: much less, that He had concluded or Signed those Articles so
destructive both to Church and State, and so repugnant to His Majesty's
public Professions, and known Resolutions.

And for the further vindication of His Majesty's Honor and Integrity herein,
He does Declare, That He is so far from considering any thing contained in
those Papers or Writings framed by the said Earl, and those Commissioners with
whom he Treated, as He does absolutely disavow him therein, and has given
Commandment to the Lord Lieutenant, and the Council there, to proceed against
the said Earl, as one, who, either out of falsenesse, presumption, or folly,
has so hazarded the blemishing of His Majesty's Reputation with His good
Subjects, and so impertinently framed those Articles of his own head, without
the Consent, Privity, or Directions of His Majesty, or the Lord Lieutenant, or
any of His Majesty's Council there. But true it is, That for the necessary
preservation of His Majesty's Protestant Subjects in Ireland, whose Case was
daily represented unto Him to be so desperate, His Majesty had given Commission
to the Lord Lieutenant to Treat and Conclude such a Peace there, as might be
for the safety of that Crown, the preservation of the Protestant Religion, and
no way derogatory to His own Honor and public Professions.

But to the end, that His Majesty's real intentions in this business of
Ireland, may be the more clearly understood, and to give more ample
satisfaction to both Houses of Parliament, and the Commissioners of the
Parliament of Scotland, especially concerning His Majesty's not being engaged
in any Peace or Agreement there; He does desire, if the two Houses shall
resolve to admit of His Majesty's repair to London, for a Personal Treaty, (as
was formerly proposed) that speedy notice be given thereof to His Majesty, and
a pass or safe Conduct, with a blank sent for a Messenger to be immediately
dispatched into Ireland, to prevent any accident that may happen to hinder His
Majesty's Resolution of leaving the manageing of the business of Ireland
wholly to the two Houses, and to make no Peace, there but with their consent,
which in case it shall please God to bless His endeavors in the Treaty with
success. His Majesty does hereby engage Himself to do.

And for a further explanation of His Majesty's Intentions in His former
Messages, He does now Declare, That if His Personal repair to London as
aforesaid, shall be admitted, and a Peace thereon shall ensue, He will then
leave the nomination of the Persons to be entrusted with the Militia, wholly to
His two Houses, with such power and limitations as are expressed in the Paper
delivered by His Majesty's Commissioners at Uxbridge the 6. of Febr. 1644. for
the term of Seven years, as has been desired, to begin immediately after the
conclusion of the Peace, the disbanding of all Forces on both sides, and the
dismantling of the Garrisons erected since these present Troubles, so as at the
expiration of the time before mentioned, the power of the Militia shall
entirely revert and remain as before.

And for their further security, His Majesty (the Peace succeeding) will be
content, that pro hac vice the two Houses shall nominate the Admiral, Officers
of State and Judges, to hold their places during life, or quam diu se been
gesserint, which shall be best liked, to be accomptable to none but the King,
and the two Houses of Parliament.

As for matter of Religion; His Majesty does further Declare, That by the
liberty offered in his Message of the 15. present, for the ease of their
Consciences who will not communicate in the Service already established by Act
of Parliament in this Kingdom; He intends that all other Protestants behaving
themselves peaceably in and toward the Civil Government, shall have the free
exercise of their Religion, according to their own way.

And for the total removing of all Fears and Jealousies, His Majesty is
willing to agree, That upon the conclusion of Peace, there shall be a general
Act of Oblivion and Free Pardon past by Acts of Parliaments in both his
Kingdoms respectively.

And lest it should be imagined that in the making these Propositions, his
Majesty's Kingdom of Scotland, and his Subjects there have been forgotten or
neglected, his Majesty Declares, That what is here mentioned touching the
Militia, and the naming of Officers of State and Judges, shall likewise extend
to his Kingdom of Scotland.

And now his Majesty having so fully and clearly expressed his Intentions and
desires of making a happy and wel-grounded Peace, if any person shall decline
that happ^nesse by opposing of so apparent a way of attaining it, he will
sufficiently demonstrate to all the world his intention and Design can be no
other, then the total subversion and change of the ancient and happy
Government of this Kingdom under which the English Nation has so long
flourished.

Given at the Court at Oxford the 29 of Jan. 1645. For the Speaker of the House
of Peers pro tempore, To be Communicated to the two Houses of Parliament at
Westminster, and the Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland.

HIs Majesty's care and pains in the former part of this Message was wholly
ineffectuall to the ends intended, for as if they had secretly vowed (as
perhaps they have) to go contrary to Him, and Christian Religion in every
thing, they took advantage from this very business of Ireland, (thus
disclaimed by the King) to sclaunder Him further and defame Him: to which
purpose they publish^d soon after certain Papers with this Title, The Earl of
Glam^rgans negotiations, and colorable Co^mitment in Ireland, that thereby it
might be apprehended the King (like themselves) had dissembled, in all He had
said or writ about that matter. And in their late Declaration they most
impudently affirm, that His Majesty gave a private Commission to the said Earl,
commanding him to manage it with all possible secrecy, and it contained (say
they) such odious and shameful things, as Himself blushed to own, or to
impart to His own Lieutenant, the Earl of Ormond: this they write upon their
own testimony, as if they had been eye and ear witnesses of the same, and all
the world were bound to believe them: sed Deus vindex, God shall judge and
revenge too upon them, the cause of His Anointed, to whom His Gospel commands
Honor, and themselves have often sworn Reverence.

And as His Majs. care in the former was ineffectual, so His grace in the
latter part of this Message was altogether fruitless; for though Subjects (if
Subjects) were they never so guilty, could wish for no more then is there
offered; for there is Liberty for their Consciences, Safety for their Persons,
Security for their Estates, Greatness for their Desires, and Peace to increase
all, and all this but for leave to let the rest of His people (their
Fellow Subjects, as good men as themselves, and much better,) live in peace by
them; yet all will not do, nothing will work upon them, for (like Pope Boniface
the 8. of that name) they came in like Foxes, and therefore mean to live like
Lions, though they die like Dogs, so that Rebellion we see is a sin
unpardonable (like that against the Holy Ghost) not because it cannot, but
because it will not be forgiven.

His Majesty after the sending this last Message of the 29. of January tarryes
a month longer even till Feb. 28. in expectation of somewhat from them in
Answer to His longing desires, and then though He was apprehensive how He had
(by His often sending) hazarded His Honor to be questioned, as well as His
proper interests to be divided or divorced from Him, yet to declare further
still to all the world, that His Peoples Preservation was more dear to Him then
both, He does once again in their behalf importune these men for the Blessing
of Peace, in these words,

His Majesty's ninth Message.
CHARLES R.

His Majesty needs to make no excuse, though He sent no more Messages unto you:
for He very well knows He ought not to do it, if He either stood upon
punctilio's of Honor, or His own private interest; the one being already
called in question by His often sending; and the other assuredly prejudged if a
Peace be concluded from that He has already offered, He having therein
departed with many of His undoubted Rights. But nothing being equally dear unto
him, to the preservation of his people, his Majesty passes by many scruples,
neglects and delays, and once more desires you to give him a speedy Answer to
his last Message; for his Majesty believes it does very well become him (after
this very long delay) at last to utter his impatience, since that the goods and
blood of his Subjects cries so much for Peace.

Given at the Court at Oxford, the 26 of Febr. 1645. For the Speaker of the
House of Peers pro tempore, To be Communicated to the two Houses of Parliament
at Westminster, and the Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland.

AS Christ's meekness and mighty works made his Enemies more obdurate, so the
Kings mildness and many Messages made these men more obstinate, who are as dumb
to this last, as to the former: And though His Majesty tells them that the Gods
and blood of His Subjects does cry so much for Peace, that He shall be forced
there^y to utter His impatience, yet these hard-hearted men had rather hear
those sad and lamentable cries, then listen to these yearnings of their fathers
Bowels; nay, and they must be called and accounted Patriots of their Country
for all this, and He, who is thus tenderly affected toward it, (in this its
bleeding Condition) must be reckoned and reported the Common Enemy unto it: for
they are not ashamed (notwithstanding these His many pantings and breathings
after the Health of it) to appropriate unto Him their own Tigerly dispositions,
and to tell the whole world in the first page of their late impudent
Declaration, that neither the sighs, Groans, tears, nor crying blood, an heavy
cry (say they) of Fathers, Brothers, Children, and of many hundred thousand
freeborn Subjects at once, can persuade Him to pity or Compassion: Surely
could Satan help them to devise worse evil then is in themselves, or then they
have acted to cast upon the King, these His Humble and Loyal Subjects would not
be so void of shame as thus to charge Him with their own doings and Conditions.

Well, His Majesty after He had sent this last Message, waits yet another
month for some Answer, though to as little purpose as before, He did but
pursue the shadow that fled from Him, by seeking peace at their hands, for
they were resolved by slighting Him, to make him desist at length from writing
thus to them. But behold the true Image of our most patient God, in this our
most Christian King, who having to do with a like stif-necked and rebellious
people, as he of old had, thinks it His duty to follow him still in the same
path, though with as little comfort or hopes of prevailing; and hereupon sends
the tenth time, and offers to come, and trust Himself wholly with them, if He
might but have their own faith and promise for the safety of His Person, Honor
and Estate, which themselves had so solemnly protested to defend; and that His
friends (who had done according to their Duty and Protestation) might not (for
the same) be deprived of their Liberties or estates, but enjoy both, with a
freedom of Conscience from unlawful Oaths: upon these sole Conditions He will
pardon and forget all that was past on their sides, giving them what security
themselves can devise, He will follow their advise (for the good of His People)
rather then other men's; and in a word, He will grant them as much, as till then
they had ever desired, or made pretense unto, and all to procure a speedy Peace
to these Afflicted Kingdoms. His words are these,

His Majesty's tenth Message.
CHARLES R.

NOtwithstandig the unexpected silence instead of Answer to his Majesty's many
and gracious Messages to both Houses, whereby it may appear, that they desire
to obtain their ends by Force, rather then Treaty, which may justly discourage
his Majesty from any more overtures of that kind, yet his Majesty conceives He
shall be much wanting to His duty to God, and in what He owes to the safety of
His people if He should not intend to prevent the great inconveniences that may
otherwise hinder a safe and wel-grounded peace. His Majesty therefore now
proposes, that, so He may have the faith of both Houses of Parliament for the
preservation of His Honor, Person, and Estate; and that Liberty be given to
all those who do and have adhered to His Majesty to go to their own Houses, and
there to live peaceably enjoying their Estates, all Sequestrations being taken
off, without being compelled to take any Oath not enjoined by the undoubted
Laws of the Kingdom, or being put to any other molestation whatsoever, He will
immediately disband all His Forces, and dismantle all His Garrisons, and being
accompanied with His Royal, not His Martial Attendance, return to His two
Houses of Parliament, and there reside with them. And for the better security
of all His Majesty's Subjects, He proposes that He with His said two Houses
immediately upon His coming to Westminster will pass an Act of Oblivion and
free pardon, and where His Majesty will further do whatsoever they will advise
Him for the good and peace of this Kingdom. And as for the Kingdom of Scotland
His Majesty has made no mention of it here, in regard of the great loss of
time which must now be spent in expecting an Answer from thence, but declares
that, immediately upon His coming to Westminster, He will apply Himself to
give them all satisfaction touching that Kingdom. If His Majesty could
possibly doubt the success of this offer, He could use many arguments to
persuade them to it; but shall only insist on that great One of giving an
instant Peace to these afflicted Kingdoms.

Given at our Court at Oxford, the 23 of March, 1645. For the Speaker of the
House of Peers pro tempore, to be Communicated to the two Houses of
Parlialiament at Westminster.

AS God said, what could I have done more for my vineyard which I have not
done? so may this good Prince say, what could I have offered more for the Peace
of my afflicted People, which I have not offered? These men (that will accept
of nothing) tell the world in their lace Declaration, that themselves had made
Application to Him for Peace, no less then seven times (scil. in seven years.)
But the world has now seen, that His Majesty has made Applications to them
for the same thing, no less then ten times in less then four months, and in
another form and style too, then theirs were to Him, and not one word in Answer
can He get from them; yea for Peace sake He offers to venture Himself among
them, but they will none of Him, He would come to His own (as they call
themselves) but His own will not receive Him.

It shall not be amiss, if the world, to whom the appeal is made, shall call
to mind in this place, some few of their many former solemn professions which
are directly contradicted by these their present behaviors; let their
Protestation or Declaration of October. 22. 1642. be read, and therein they will
find these expressions.

We the Lords and Commons in this present Parliament Assembled, do in the
presence of Almighty God, for the satisfaction of our Consciences, and
discharge of that great trust which lies upon us, make this Protestation and
Declaration to this Kingdom and Nation, and to the whole World, that no
private passion or respect, no evil intention to His Majesty's Person, no
design to the prejudice of His just Honor and Authority engaged us to raise
forces, and take up Arms, etc.

And again,

We profess from our very Hearts and Souls, our Loyalty and Obedience to His
Crown; readiness and resolution to defend His Person, and support His Estate
with our lives and fortunes, to the uttermost of our power.

Again,

We profess, we desire nothing from His Majesty, but that He would return in
Peace to His Parliament.

And again,

We profess in the sight of Almighty God, which is the strongest obligation
that a Christian, and the most solemn public faith, which any such State as
a Parliament can give; that we would receive Him with all Honor, yield Him all
true obedience and subjection, and faithfully endeavor to defend His Person
and Estate from all danger, and to the utmost of our power to stablish Him, and
His people all the blessings of a most Glorious and Happy Reign, etc.

Surely they, who shall compare these Professions, with the present Carriages
of them that made them, will conclude them the vilest Atheists that ever lived;
and believe that they used these Protestations only, to gull and seduce the
well meaning Common People, that so they might cheat them of their Moneys, and
engage them with themselves in ways of Treason, Blood and Rebellion, to the
destruction of their Religion, King and Country: But verily there is a God that
judges the Earth, and that these mockers of Him shall feel ere long, for the
day of their Calamity is at Hand, and the things that are coming upon them
make have.

Well, his Maj. after he had sent this His tenth Message for Peace, and, waited
another month and more, for an Answer thereof, having understood by their
former unworthy Paper of the 13 of Ianu. (and being confirmed also, by their
silence to all His Profers) that no admittance would be granted to Him, though
He came alone; for as at the approach of Christ, the Devil raged and tore the
party possessed; so did jealousies and guilty fears rend and torment them at
the Apprehension of His presence, or access unto them; and therefore, till He
should first consent to such Propositions as they would at their further
leisure send unto Him; He must not come near them, unless He be brought by the
Soldiers before them, as Christ was into the High Priests Hall, viz. in the
nature of a Prisoner: and indeed to this purpose, while they think to delude
Him, still with a further expectation of Propositions (which they never meant
should be seen at Oxford;) they send thither as fast as they can, all their
Armies and Bands of Soldiers, with Guns and Swords, and Staves for to take
Him; concluding with themselves, that He would surely fall into the Hand of
their Strong ones, and could not possibly escape them: But God was too hard for
them. He seeing their mischeivous intentions, inclined the Heart of His Majesty
to go, and protected Him safe in going to the Scottish Army: where so soon as
He came, (that all might see His desires of Peace, were not capable of
abatement) He falls again to His old work of soliciting for the same; and
offers to these unreasonable men, all that ever was desired to give them
content: He refers to them and their Divines the settling of Religion; He
consents the Militia to be at their disposal, His Forces to be disbanded, His
Towns and Garrisons dismantled and deserted, and what ever else had been
formerly in dispute betwixt them; and if these would not be now accepted,
because offered by Him, (though formerly desired by them) He wills them to send
their long promised Propositions, or at least, those of them which were agreed
upon, being resolved to comply in every thing, as shall but appear to Him, to
be for His Subjects happiness: And notwithstanding all the contempts they had
shown Him, and affronts put upon Him; He still has, or desires to have so good
an opinion of them, that He will not question their good acceptance of these
His offers, since He makes no conditions with them for Himself, but is content
to leave His own Honor and Lawful Rights, solely to their care and gratitude
to maintain unto Him: Let all men read (without admiration if they can at the
Kings Christianity and goodness) this which follows: how in very deed He
yields up His will and Affections, His Reason, Judgment, and all for the
obtaining a good peace or accommodation with these Stubborn men unto His poor
and afflicted people.

His Majesty's eleventh Message.
CHARLES R.

HIs Majesty having understood from both His Houses of Parliament, that it was
not safe for him to come to London (whither he had purposed to repair, if so he
might, by their advice to do whatsoever may be best for the good and peace of
these Kingdoms) until he shall first give his consent to such Propositions, as
were to be presented to him from them: And being certainly informed that the
Armies were marching so fast up to Oxford, and made that no fit place for
Treating, did resolve to withdraw himself hither, only to secure his own
Person, and with no intention to continue this War any longer, or to make any
division between his two Kingdoms, but to give such contentment to both, as, by
the blessing of God, he might see a happy and wel-grounded Peace, thereby to
bring Prosperity to these Kingdoms, answerable to the best times of his
Progenitors.

And since the settling of Religion ought to be the chiefest care of all
Councels, his Majesty most earnestly and heartily recommends to his two Houses
of Parliament all the ways and means possible, for speedy finishing this pious
and necessary work; and particularly, that they take the advice of the Divines
of both Kingdoms assembled at Westminster. Likewise concerning the Militia of
England, for securing his people against all pretensions of danger, his Majesty
is pleased to have it settled as was offered at the Treaty at Uxbridge, all the
Persons being to be named for the Trust by the two Houses of the Parliament of
England, for the space of seven years, and after the expiring of that term,
that it be regulated as shall be agreed upon by his Majesty and his two Houses
of Parliament.

And the like for the Kingdom of Scotland.

Concerning the Wars in Ireland, his Majesty will do whatsoever is possible for
him, to give full satisfaction therein.

And if these be not satisfactory, his Majesty then desires that all such of
the Propositions as are already agreed upon by both Kingdoms may be speedily
sent unto him; his Majesty being resolved to comply with his Parliament in
every thing that shall be for the happiness of his Subjects, and for the
removing of all unhappy differences, which have produced so many sad effects.

His Majesty having made these offers, he will neither question the thankful
acceptance of them; nor does he doubt but that his two Kingdoms will be
careful to maintain him in his Honor, and in his just and lawful Rights,
which is the only way to make a happy composure of these unnatural Divisions.
And likewise will think upon a solid way of conserving the Peace between the
two Kingdoms for time to come. And will take a speedy course for easing and
quieting his afflicted people by satisfying the Public debts, by disbanding of
all Armies, and whatsoever else shall be judged conducible to that end: that
so, all hindrances being removed, he may return to his Parliament with mutual
comfort.

Southwell, May 18. 1646. POSTSCRIPT.
HIs Majesty being desirous to shun the further effusion of blood, and to
evidence His real intentions to Peace, is willing that His Forces in, and
about Oxford be disbanded, and the fortifications of the City dismantled, they
receiving honorable conditions. Which being granted to the Town and Forces
there, His Majesty will give the like order to the rest of the Garrisons.


For the Speaker of the House of Peers pro tempore, To be Communicated to the
two Houses of Parliament at Westminster, and the Commissioners of the
Parliament of Scotland.

THis Message from His Majesty out of the Scots Quarters, though as full of
Grace as could be wished, found as little respect as any of the former, and was
thought as unworthy of an Answer; for indeed it spoke (to their great grief)
the escape of that rich prey which was already swallowed in their Expectations,
yea and an impossibility of getting it into their reach again with so little
cost and pains as they hoped before to be possessed of it: for they conceived
the frugall Scot was not like to part with his Liege Lord, and native King for
nothing; nor be so easily beaten from hence to their own home, as was intended
they should have been, so soon as the Kings Person had been seized on at
Oxford: for His Majesty's Presence, like the Glorious Sun, drew thousands of
Eyes upon His Countrymen, and would have fetched as many hearts and hands to
their Assistance, had they but then stood up in defense of Him. This they at
Westminster well knew, and hereupon saw, that a kind of necessity lay on them,
to shuffle again, and after another fashion then before was purposed: to play
the Foxes instead of the Lions with their dear Brethren: and therefore they
begin at last to think of doing that, which till now they never intended,
though often promised: even of sending Propositions to the King: which on July
24. (two months after their receipt of this last Message of May 18.) arived at
Him, under the name of Propositions for Peace: but the contrivers of them, had
in their Provident care made them so perfectly monstrous and unreasonable, that
themselves remained sure still of being out of all danger of Effecting Peace by
them: in very deed they were only used to gain time and opportunity to recover
their lost prey, and to delude the Scots, who were not then so well acquainted
with their spirits, as (perhaps) since they have been, or at least may be,
before a period be put to these troubles. Those Propositions of theirs were as
tedious as senseless, for what they wanted in reason, was made up in words,
they have been published already, and therefore we shall not here trouble the
Reader with them, there be Copies enough extant of them, which whosoever views,
will think the Kingdom might have employed their many hundred thousand pounds
better, then in maintaining so many men, and so many Armies so many months
together, in doing nothing but making such uncouth Prpositions. By this ensuing
Message of his Majesty in Answer to them, within a week after His receipt of
them, the world (were it ignorant of them) might have a glimpse of what kind
they were, and of what spirit those that sent them.

His Majesty's twelfth Message.
CHARLES R.

THe Propositions tendered to His Majesty by the Commissioners from the Lords
and Commons Assembled in the Parliament of England at Westminster, and the
Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland, (to which the Houses of Parliament
have taken twice so many Months for deliberation, as they have assigned days
for his Majesty's Answer) do import so great alterations in Government, both in
Church and Kingdom, as it is very difficult to return a particular and
positive Answer before a full debate, wherein these Propositions and the
necessary explanations, true sense and reasons thereof be rightly weighed and
understood, and that his Majesty upon a full view of the whole Propositions may
know what is left, as well as what is taken away and changed, In all which he
finds (upon discourse with the said Commissioners that they are so bound up
from any capacity, either to give reasons for the demands they bring, or to
give ear to such desires as his Majesty is to propound, as it is impossible for
him to give such a present judgment of, and Answer to these Propositions,
whereby he can Answer to God that a safe and well-grounded peace will ensue
(which is evident to all the world can never be, unless the just power of the
Crown, as well as the freedom and propriety of the Subject, with the just
liberty and privileges of the Parliament be likewise settled) To which end his
Majesty desires and proposes to come to London, or any of his houses
thereabouts upon the public faith, and security of the two houses of
Parliament, and the Scotch Commissioners, That he shall be there with freedom,
honor, and safety, where by his personal presence he may not only raise a
mutual confidence betwixt him and his people, but also have these doubts
cleared, and these difficulties explained unto him, which he now conceives to
be destructive to his just regal power, if he shall give a full consent to
these Propositions as they now stand.

As likewise, that he make known to them, such his reasonable demands as he is
most assured will be very much conducible to that Peace, which all good men
desire and pray for, by the settling of Religion, the just privileges of
Parliament, with the freedom and propriety of the Subject; and his Majesty
assures them that as he can never condescend unto what is absolutely
destructive to that just power, which by the laws of God and the Land he is
born unto; So he will cheerfully grant, and give his assent unto all such Bills,
at the desire of his two Houses, or reasonable demands for Scotland, which
shall be really for the good and Peace of his people, not having regard to his
own particular (much less of any bodies else) in respect of the happiness of
these Kingdoms. Wherefore his Majesty conjures them as Christians, as Subjects,
and as men who desire to leave a good name behind them, that they will so
receive and make use of this Answer, that all issues of blood may be stopped,
and these unhappy distractions peaceably settled.

Newcastle, August 1. 1646. POSTSCRIPT.
Upon assurance of a happy agreement, His Majesty will immediately send for the
Prince His Son, absolutely expecting His perfect Obedience to return into this
Kingdom.


To the Speaker of the House of Peers pro tempore, to be communicated.

BY this Message the Readers may observe, that the contrivers of those
Propositions, though themselves were many, and had employed all their craft,
(which was not little) 8 Months together (as they pretended) in the framing of
them, yet were persuaded (as it seems) that His Majesty alone, in regard of His
clear wisdom, sincerity, and honesty of Heart; was able in three or four days
to Answer them fully; and therefore they assigned him no longer time to
deliberate on them: or else they supposed that His Maj. in His eagerness of
mind to obtain Peace, so often and earnestly writ for by Him, would blindly and
suddenly consent without more ado, to what ever (on that condition) they
asked of Him: for as crafty Chapmen will enhaunse the price (beyond all reason)
of that Commodity they have to sell, when they see a Customer fond of it; so
did these men deal with their King: He had fully manifested a most fervent
desire of procuring quiet to His people, by His many Messages and large Offers,
wherein He had showed a readiness to yield up His own Rights, or (to speak in
their phrase) His will and Affections, yea, and His Reason and Judgment too,
for the purchase of it: So it were real and good: Whereupon, perhaps they
fancied that He would not stick to resign up His Conscience also, (upon their
demand) together with the Rights of His Crown (to which He was born) and the
trust committed to Him by God and the Law, over the lives and Estates of all
His Subjects, into those Hands which have been excercised in nothing this seven
years, but Blood, Rapine, and Oppression, without any probability of recovering
the same again to Himself, or His successors.

For, indeed they are now come to that pitch of the pinnacle, that unless the
King will condescend to cast Himself down, to destroy himself, and to ruin
Monarchy, no concessions of His shall please them, nor shall his many Messages
and large offers obtain peace from them unto his people; who may themselves
judge of what kind it would be, (by that experience they have had of them
already) if the King should yield so far, as to lay down his life and Crown for
the purchase.

But God be thanked, our King is no Child, nor false Shepherd; but a man after
Gods own Heart, and a very Moses, though meek and patient to admiration in his
own case, (throughout all his dealings with this stif-necked and rebellious
generation;) yet most valiant and magnanimous in the Cause of God, and most
faithful in the dicharge of that trust reposed in Him: our Savior would
rather suffer himself to be no Man, then yield himself to be no King; he would
rather part with his life, then his Kingship, and so will our Sovereign: and
therefore our God (we trust) will preserve both, for the further Happiness,
yet of this Church and Nation.

But let us observe His Majesty's goodness toward these men, in this His
Message or Answer to their Propositions; He was ashamed (as seems) that the
world should take full notice of their impiety and unreasonablenesse in them;
and therefore was pleased to shadow the same (in a measure) from the worlds
eye, by impleading the difficulty of understanding the said Propositions for
want of necessary explanations, as if there had been, or might happily be more
Justice and Reason in them, then was apparent (when indeed there was more
mischeife then could be easily believed:) And this he alleges as the cause of
his not returning particular Answers to them; and in truth, there is much
ambiguity and darkness in them, which the Contrivers were studious and
careful to leave in their composing of them, that thereby themselves might
still have evasions, and occasions to raise cavills, what ever His Majesty's
Answer should be unto them: to which end also they were provident to Bind up
their Commissioners tongues from speaking any such word in way of discourse, as
might discover to the King their further meanings.

Wherefore his Majesty finding it impossible to return such a plenary Answer,
as in His Conscience might be justifiable in Gods sight, or conductive to a
safe and well-grounded peace; he proposes again his own coming to London, to
treat with them, and (for the avoiding of all mistakes) to hear them explain
their own meanings; and ingages himself to give his cheerful assent to all
such Bills as shall be really to the good and peace of His people, and to
prefer the Happiness of this Kingdom, before His own particular; and as a
mean to work a confidence in them, of His own sincerity in these things; he
offers again to trust them with no less then his own Person; and conjures
them, as they are Christians, as they are Subjects, and as they are men, who
desire to leave a good name behind them, so to receive, and make use of this
His Answer, that all issues of Blood may be stopped, and these unhappy
distractions peaceably settled.

But (as appears) neither the Dignity of Christians, the Duty of Subjects, nor
the Credit of a good Name will prevail with them, any more then his Majesty's
former Messages and Entreaties had done; for they had (as it seems) renounced
and rejected them all before hand, and therefore without taking any notice of
this Conjuration of their Sovereign, or of any thing else which he had writ
unto them in the whole Message; they go on silently, and resolutely, in that
way which themselves had chosen.

which His Majesty observing after some months patient expectance, bent His
thoughts to the making some particular Answers to the forementioned
Propositions, desiring (if possible) to give them content: but upon His most
serious consideration on them, He found that He did but labor in vain, for He
could not speak so unto them, but some (who lay in wait for that purpose) would
mis-construe and pervert His sayings to a contrary sense, unless Himself were
present among them to paraphrase upon his own words, and explain His meaning,
wherefore He hoping that Gods grace and spirit might at last (peradventure)
have some footing in their minds, He rather chooses to propose again by another
Message (five months after the former) His own coming unto them, and renues His
former offers, discovering thereby that notwithstanding their transcendent
neglects and contempts of Him, yet He was still as constant in His good
intentions to them, as they were in their ill resolutions against Him: His
words are these.

His Majesty's thirteenth Message.
CHARLES R.

HIs Majesty's thoughts being always sincerely bent to the Peace of His
Kingdoms, was and will be ever desirous to take all ways which might the most
clearly make appear the candor of His intentions to His people. And to this
end, could find no better way then to propose a Personal free debate with His
two Houses of Parliament upon all the present differences. Yet finding very
much against His expectations, that this offer was laid aside, His Majesty bent
all His thoughts to make His intentions fully known by a particular Answer to
the Propositions delivered to Him in the name of both Kingdoms, 24. July last.
But the more He endeavored it, He more plainly saw that any Answer He could
make would be subject to mis-informations and mis-constructions, which upon His
own Paraphrases and Explanations He is most confident will give so good
satisfaction, as would doubtless cause a happy and lasting Peace. Lest
therefore that good intentions may produce ill effects, His Majesty again
proposes, and desires again to come to London, or any of His Houses
thereabouts, upon the Publ^ke Faith and Security of His two Houses of
Parliament, and the Scotch Commissioners, that He shall be there with Honor,
Freedom, and Safety: Where, by His Personal Presence, He may not only raise a
mutual confidence betwixt Him and His People, but also have those doubts
cleared, and those difficulties explained to Him, without which He cannot (but
with the aforesaid mischievous inconveniences) give a particular Answer to the
Propositions: And with which He doubts not, but so to manifest His real
intentions for the settling of Religion, the just privileges of Parliament,
with the Freedom and Property of the Subject, that it shall not be in the
power of wicked and malicious men to hinder the establishing of that firm Peace
which all honest men desire. Assuring them, as He will make no other Demands
but such as He believes confidently to be just, and much conducing to the
Tranquillity of the People: So He will be most willing to condescend to them in
whatsoever shall be really for their good and happiness. Not doubting likewise
but you will also have a due regard to maintain the just Power of the Crown,
according to your many Protestations and professions. For certainly, except
King and People have reciprocal care each of other, neither can be happy.

To conclude, it is your King who desires to be heard, (the which, if refused to
a Subject by a King, he would be thought a Tyrant for it) and for that end
which all men profess to desire. Wherefore His Majesty conjures you, as you
desire to show your selves really what you profess, even as you are good
Christians and Subjects, that you will accept this His Offer, which He is
confident God will so bless, that it will be the readiest means by which these
Kingdoms may again become a comfort to their Friends, and a terror to their
Enemies.

Newcastle, 20. December. 1646. To the Speaker of the House of Peers pro tempore,
to be communicated to the two Houses of Parliament at Westminster, and to the
Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland.

WHat man can read without tears, these pathetick desires and expressions of
His Sovereign, only to be Heard, and that but to Speak and plead by word of
mouth, for the peace and tranquillity of His people, since His many Messages by
writing (to this purpose) were not regarded? sure these Persons have hearts
harder then the neither Mil-stone, they have forgot themselves to be, either
Christians, Subjects, or men; but doubtless the time will come, when they, who
thus stop their ears at the requests of their King, shall themselves cry, and
not be heard, and no man shall pity them. His Majesty we see, refuses nothing
which may tend to the settling of Religion, the freedom of Parliament, and
property of the Subjects: He denies no pardon, security, or indemnity, to these
His Enemies, (that will not have Him to reign over them) if they would accept
it: His own rights He Will refer to them to be settled, as may be to the Kingdoms
good, as to His own; in a probable continuation of Gods blessing upon the same,
as upon himself: His Person He offers to their trust, and the just power of His
Crown to their care; nor is He willing so much as to doubt of their due regard
in maintaining the same unto Him, according to their many Protestations and
professions.

And nothing does He desire for Himself (in lieu of all this) but only leave to
speak, liberty to be heard, which Himself in His prosperity never denied to the
meanest Person, though the greatest Malefactor: Let all the world with
admiration think upon it, and judge in the case, what Prince can offer more,
then He has done? or what man can desire less? what Christian spirit does not
rise to see Piety and Majesty thus slighted, and despised? what Subjects blood
does not boil to hear his Sovereign forced for the purchase of so little, to
offer so much unto His own Vassals, and yet be repulsed and rejected by them?
should Turks and Heathens behold this, they would be enraged; could the
inferior Creatures apprehend it, even they would grow furious at it: surely,
this is, and may be, a matter of astonishment to the whole earth, for (as the
Prophet says) Pass over the Isles, send to other Lands, inquire of all
Nations, search all stories of former and later times, consider diligently, and
see well, if there be, or ever were any such thing, or ever the like heard of,
from the beginning of time: Did ever people thus exclude their King, or thus
vilely use him? set but that act of the Jews aside against our Savior, and
this example may be affirmed to be Sans parallel: never did Subjects make
larger protestations and professions of love and duty, and never could Devils
go more contrary unto the same then these men have done: let but those their
words already quoted (upon the tenth Message) be seriously considered on, and
of necessity it will be concluded, that Hell is not more opposite to Heaven,
nor darkness to light, then their carriages are, and have been unto those
expressions: and so it seems it is resolved they shall be still, for His
Majesty's conjuring them to show themselves really to be what they professed,
no whit moves them to show themselves any other then they really are: now they
have caught the fish, cheated the people, inslaved the Nation, got their own
ends, the power into their hands to keep all men under, they may fling away
their baits, throw off their vizards, cast aside their disguises, and appear
freely in their proper shapes and colors: All their solemn Protestations and
professions were of the same nature and tenure, with their solemn League and
Covenant, which (as Martin himself, one of their prime birds, openly says) was
not intended to be everlastingly kept; the causes of making them being but as
the grounds of striking that, merely occasional, for the joining in a War to
suppress the Common Enemy (for so now they call the King) and He being
suppressed, what are the Protestations and professions come to be, but as the
Covenant it self is, only like an Almanac of last year, of no more regard or
estimation, witness Hen. Martin, p. 11. of Indepency of England maintin'd
against the claim of the Scotch Commissioners.

In vain therefore did His Majesty (by mentioning their former Protestations
and professions) put them in mind of things out of date; and to as little
purpose did He again desire to come to London in Safety and Honor, for they
could not hear on that side; indeed they were otherwise busied at that time,
even trucking to get Him into their power another way, then that was which He
propounded: for have Him they would, they were resolved on that, what ere it
cost them; and they meant to receive Him too, but not in that manner as He
desired, not with Safety, but into safe custody, from enjoying his Liberty; not
with Honor to Him, but in triumph to themselves; not as their Prince, but as
their Prisoner: even directly as the Jews at length received Christ, not as the
gift of his own free love, but as the price of their own base money; So that His
Majesty saw ere long (after His sending the last Message) a perfect
frustration, both of it, and all His former and that Himself had somewhat else
to do, beside begging peace unto His people, and Liberty of Speech unto
Himself: for freedom of Conscience to serve God, after the legal and
established way of the true Protestant English Church, is now denied Him, as an
additionall punishment to His outward restraint, which now also is laid upon
Him, for being so importunate for His Subjects freedom from war and pressures.

Holdenby is the place of His inclosement, He was carried thither, as Christ
into the wilderness to be tempted; and kept there with as much care from
spiritual food, as Christ was from bodily, and that not forty days together
only, but above three times forty; and under temptations all the while: Master
Marshall and his fellow Minister being chose out to act Satan's part upon Him:
for having been so specially isntrumental in destroying the Souls of His
People, and in stirring them up to kill each other, they were judged the
fittest in the whole Legion to assault Him: And all the helps to vexation and
trouble, that the Heads at Westminster could think upon, these Tempters had for
their advantage: But the Spirit of God was so strong in this Royal Champion,
that they were not able to stand before Him, nor to resist the wisdom and
Learning by which He spoke, insomuch that as they in the Gospel were forced to
confess, whether they would or no, that Christ was the Son of God, though
before they had labored to obscure him: so were these, even compelled against
their own wills to acknowledge in secret, among their friends, that the King
was a most able, judicious Prince, and the wisest man in all His Kingdoms,
clean contrary to that, which they had often blattered in Pulpits against Him
before the People. And Master Marshall at last, was so tormented with His
Majesty's Divinity and Reason, by being so near him, that he wished to be in
the Herd again (his more proper place) where he was likely to effect more
mischief, and therefore besought his Masters at Westminster, to be recalled
from Holdenby, or sent no more thither.

But though His Majesty was able enough of Himself to encounter these, yet for
the better exercise of His Conscience in pious duties, and for the further
clearing of His judgment concerning the present differences, He desires to have
two from out of twelve of His own Chaplains to attend upon Him, which He
desires His two Houses to make choice of, and send to Him; in these words,

His Majesty's fourteenth Message.
His Majesty's gracious Message to both Houses of Parliament, concerning His
Chaplains.
SInce I have never dissembled, nor hid my Conscience, and that I am not yet
satisfied with the alteration of Religion, to which you desire my consent, I
will not yet lose time in giving reasons, which are too obvious to every body,
why it is fit for me to be attended by some of my Chaplains, whose opinions, as
Clergy men, I esteem and reverence; not only for the exercise of my Conscience,
but also for clearing of my judgment concerning the present differences in
Religion; as I have at full declared to Master Marshall and his
Fellow-Minister: having showed them, that it is the best and likeliest means of
giving me satisfaction, which without it I cannot have in these times: Whereby
the distractions of this Church may be the better settled. Wherefore I desire
that, at least, two of these Reverend Divines, whose names I have here set
down, may have free liberty to wait upon me, for the discharge of their duty
unto me, according to their function.

Closet. D. Marsh, Deane of York. D. Sanderson. D. Baily. D. Heywood. D. Beale.

Holdenby, 17. Febr. 1646. For the Speaker of the House of Peers pro tempore,
to be communicated, etc.

THe matter of this Message or thing desired therein, is freedom of
Conscience, and the necessary means to serve God, according to the Doctrine and
way of the English Church.

The Person from whom the request comes, is the King of this Nation, the
Supreamest Defender under God upon Earth of the Protestant Faith, who never
denied the exercise of it to any creature. And the Men to whom the same is
sent, are the most open Protestors that ever were for freedom and Liberty in
this kind, and that to all men: and the most violent exclaimers against those
that restrain any: yea and they are such beside as call themselves His
Majesty's most Humble and Loyal Subjects: therefore it may be thought a thing
impossible, that this request should not be granted: specially too, if we do
but observe how CHARLES R. appears below, submissively at the bottom, (now He
moves for a private matter, and as a Christian) which is wont always when He
writes about public and Kingly Affairs to stand above, in its proper place,
before the beginning.

Oh but these are rare men, they never denied themselves yet, but the King
ever, it cannot be said to this day, that they have yielded to Him, in the
least particular, since they there sat, and should they begin now to break
their old wont? so they might seem to halt in their resolved course, and He
might happily flatter Himself too much in hoping they meant to look toward Him:
wherefore though all men else, have leave to be of what Religion they list, and
to worship God after what fashion they please; yet He for His part shall not be
suffered to have the means to serve him the true way, not to hear the Doctrine
of that Church which themselves as well as He, were baptized into, and have
protested to maintain: and thereupon having practiced long to hold their peace
to His other Messages, they resolve upon silence to this also, and return
nothing: But His Majesty being well (and too well) acquainted with such usage
from their hands, and being as patient, as they were peevish; as unwearied in
good, as they in evil, does in a most calm and Christian manner renew His
request for the same thing seventeen days after, in these words:

His Majesty's fifteenth Message.
His Majesty's second Message to both Houses of Parliament, concerning His
Chaplains.
IT being now seventeen days since I wrote to you from hence, and not yet
receiving any Answer to what I then desired, I cannot but now again renew the
same unto you. And indeed concerning any thing but the necessary duty of a
Christian, I would not thus at this time trouble you with any of my desires.
But my being attended with some of my Chaplains, whom I esteem and reverence,
is so necessary for me, even considering my present condition, whether it be in
relation to my conscience, or a happy setlement of the present distractions in
Religion, that I will slight diverse kinds of censures, rather then not to
obtain what I demand; nor shall I do you the wrong, as in this, to doubt the
obtaining of my wish, it being totally grounded upon reason. For desiring you
to consider (not thinking it needful to mention) the diverse reasons, which no
Christian can be ignorant of, for point of conscience, I must assure you that I
cannot, as I ought, take in consideration those alterations in Religion, which
have and will be offered unto me, without such help as I desire; because I can
never judge rightly of, or be altered in, any thing of my opinion, so long as
any ordinary way of finding out the truth is denied me; but when this is
granted me, I promise you faithfully not to strive for victory in Argument, but
to seek and submit to Truth (according to that judgment which God has given
me) always holding it my best and greatest conquest to give contentment to my
two Houses of Parliament in all things, which, I conceive, not to be against my
conscience or honor; not doubting likewise but that you will be ready to
satisfy me in reasonable things, as I hope to find in this particular
concerning the attendance of my Chaplains upon me.

CHARLES R.
Holdenby, 6. March, 1646. For the Speaker of the House of Peers pro tempore,
to be Communicated to the two Houses of Parlialiament at Westminster.

AS an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart, brings forth evil
things; such are causlesse Jealousies, railing Accusations, and evil
surmizings against the good: So a good man out of the good treasure of his
heart, brings forth good things: such are favorable opinions, meek
expressions, and charitable constructions; and from hence it was that His
Majesty writes in this manner to, and of these men: as if He still hoped there
might possibly be some good sparks of grace, nature, or manners in them: for as
they cannot believe Him to be so good, as He is: so He cannot yet fancy them so
bad, as they be, and mean to prove themselves: He tells them, in this His
Message, that He would not have troubled them at this time, with any of His
desires, did not this particular concern the necessary duty of a Christian, and
relate so nearly to His Conscience: conceiving (is it seems) that they would be
the more inclinable in this regard, whereas (alas) their dispositions are to be
the more averse: their aims being (as has appeared by all their dealings) to
destroy His Conscience, and to keep Him from serving God at all: Have they not
often said unto Him in their language, ( Go serve other Gods?) they would at
least occasion a strangeness, betwixt His God and Him: that God might be
further off from His assistance, and so His spirit might sink more under the
Burdens which they lay upon Him: they have not forgot Balaams project against
the Israelites, and fain would they put it in practice upon their King: for
they well see, they shall never be able to do Him the mischief they intend,
while God is with Him, in this mighty manner to guide and strengthen Him: and
therefore they must first endeavor to bring Him out with His God; and since, by
all their compulsions and temptations they cannot prevail to drive Him upon
comissions of evil, they would fain force Him to be guilty of some omissions
of good, and keep Him from performing the necessary duties of a Christian, and
therefore they will not suffer Him to enjoy the service of His own Chaplains.

Again, His Majesty desires to have their service, as means relating to an
happy setlement of the present distractions in Religion, and as necessary helps
to His Conscience in the Consideration of those Alterations in the same, which
had been already, and He knew would still be offered unto Him: and this He
urges as another Argument of His wish or desire, and it being totally grounded
upon Reason, He says He doubts not to obtain it from them.

But His Majesty has since found, that His Charity was much mistaken in this
too: and indeed it is the greatest wrong that ere He did them, His thinking so
well of them, as to conceive Himself likely to obtain any of His requests at
their hands, because grounded upon Reason; or to hope for any helps from their
allowance, toward the setlement of the present distractions in Religion: for
should they yield to undo their own work? did not they make all these
distractions in Church and State? were any of them in being before they sat? do
they not live by them? could they enjoy their power, and Lord it as they do, if
things were settled in Religion? would not all things return to their proper
channels, if that were well composed? no, no, if these be the Kings ends of
desiring His Chaplains, He must learn to know (at length) that they have more
subtilty, and self-love in them, then to listen to Him. Let Him rest contented
therefore in this particular, He must enter the lists, and fight the Bataile
himself alone; for they are resolved to put Him to it, of His friends, (or
people) there shall be none with Him; no not so much as one of His own
Chaplains: And whereas He promises not to strive for victory in Argument, but
to seek and submit to Truth: He must know, that they do not look for victory
that way against Him, yet they mean to have it too, and that without any
seeking or submitting to truth at all for it.

And He may for His part (if He please) hold it His best and greatest conquest,
to give contentment to His two Houses of Parliament in all things that are not
against His Conscience and Honor: yet they who are the domineering faction in
His two Houses, (and call themselves the Parliament) will still hold it their
best and greatest conquest, to discontent and vex His spirit: nor will they
think their Conquest complete, unless they can prevail, to enforce some
breaches upon His Conscience and Honor: and therefore He may even cease from
henceforth, thus to fancy any readiness in them, to satisfy His desires in
any reasonable thing, for they will not do it in this poor particular,
concerning the Attendance of His Chaplains upon Him.

These, these are the men that contemn God, that say in their hearts, Tush, God
sees not: nor does he regard such things, nor will He ever require an account
for them: But thou do see, and thou have seen (O Lord) for thou beholdest
mischief and spite to requite it with thine hand, O keep not long silence
therefore, be not far off from thine Anointed; Stir up thy self, and awake to
his Judgment, and unto His cause, thou art his God, thou (alone) art his Lord;
Judge thou for Him according to thy righteousness, and let not these miscreant
men triumph any longer over Him, let them not say in their hearts, Ah! so would
we have it, Let them not say, we have swallowed him up, let them be ashamed and
brought to confusion together that rejoice at his hurt, yea let them be
clothed with shame and dishonor that magnify themselves against Him: but let
them shout for joy, and ever have cause to be glad, that favor His righteous
cause, yea let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified which has
pleasure in the prosperity of His servant. Amen. Amen.

His Majesty at last (having waited two months for Answer) was sufficiently
informed by their silence, how vainly He labored in soliciting for His
Chaplains, and thereupon forbears to be further importunate in that business;
it concerned His own particular self and comfort, and He can more easily desist
in pursuing a thing of that nature; then in seeking for a blessing which more
immediately concerns His people, and therefore though His request for Peace had
been rejected thirteen times already, in less then thirteen months, yet He
cannot hold from renewing that: yea though they had frustrated His expectation
a long time, in not sending such Propositions as they had promised, or given
Him hopes to receive, for His more full and clear understanding their sense in
the former, and did also keep His Person, in so unworthy, so unheard of, and so
provocative a Condition, as might have swelled with stoutnesse the mildest
heart, and awakened passion (had it not been dead) in a very Martyr, yet with
the greatest meekness and sweetness of style that can be imagined does He
write unto them again, and sends most gracious Answers to their former
unreasonable Propositions, after He had diligently endeavored and studied
diverse months how to make them such, as (salva conscientia) might be most
agreeable to the likings of His Parliaments. His words are these,

His Majesty's sixteenth Message.
His Majesty's most gracious Message for Peace from Holdenby, with His Answer
to the Propositions.
CHARLES R.

AS the daily expectation of the coming of the Propositions has made His
Majesty this long time to forbear giving His Answer unto them, so the
appearance of their sending being no more for any thing He can hear, then it
was at His first coming hither, notwithstanding that the Earl of Louderdale
has been at London above these ten days, (whose not coming was said to be the
only stop) has caused His Majesty thus to anticipate their coming to Him, and
yet considering His Condition, that His Servants are denied access to Him, all
but very few, and those by appointment, not His own Election, and that it is
declared a crime for any but the Commissioners, or such who are particularly
permitted by them, to converse with His Majesty, or that any Letters should be
given to, or received from Him, may He not truly say, that He is not in case
fit to make Concessions, or give Answers, since He is not master of those
ordinary Actions which are the undoubted Rights of any freeborn man, how mean
soever his birth be? And certainly he would still be silent as to this subject,
until His Condition were much mended, did He not prefer such a right
understanding betwixt Him and His Parliaments of both Kingdoms, which may make
a firm and lasting Peace in all His Dominions, before any particular of His
own, or any earthly blessing: and therefore His Majesty has diligently
employed His utmost indevours for diverse months past, so to inform His
Understanding, and satisfy His Conscience, that He might be able to give such
Answers to the Propositions, as would be most agreeable to His Parliaments; but
He ingenuously professes, that notwithstanding all the pains that He has taken
therein, the nature of some of them appears such unto Him, that without
disclaiming that Reason which God has given him to judge by, for the good of
Him and His People, and without putting the greatest violence upon His own
Conscience, He cannot give His consent to all of them. Yet His Majesty (that it
may appear to all the World how desirous He is to give full satisfaction) has
thought fit hereby to express His readiness to grant what He may, and His
willingness to receive from them, and that personally if His two Houses at
Westminster shall approve thereof, such further Information in the rest as may
best convince His judgment, and satisfy those doubts which are not yet clear
unto Him, desiring them also to consider that if His Majesty intended to wind
Himself out of these troubles by indirect means, were it not easy for Him now
readily to consent to what has, or shall be proposed unto Him; and afterward
choose His time to break all, alleging, that forced Concessions are not to be
kept? surely He might, and not incur a hard censure from indifferent men. But
maxims in this kind are not the guides of His Majesty's actions, for He freely
and clearly avows, that He holds it unlawful for any man, and most base in a
King to recede from His promises for having been obtained by force or under
restraint; wherefore His Majesty not only rejecting those acts which He esteems
unworthy of Him, but even passing by that which he might well insist upon, a
point of honor, in respect of His present condition, thus answers the first
Proposition. That upon His Majesty's coming to London, He will heartily join
in all that shall concern the Honor of His two Kingdoms or the Assembly of
the States of Scotland, or of the Commissioners or Deputies of either Kingdom,
particularly in those things which are desired in that Proposition, upon
confidence that all of them respectively with the same tenderness will look
upon those things which concern His Majesty's Honor.

In answer to all the Propositions concerning Religion, His Majesty proposes,
that He will confirm the Presbyteriall Government, the Assembly of Divines at
Westminster, and the Directory, for three years, being the time set down by the
two Houses, so that His Majesty and His Household be not hindered from that form
of Gods Service which they formerly have; And also, that a free consultation
and debate be had with the Divines at Westminster (twenty of His Majesty's
nomination being added unto them) whereby it may be determined by H^s Majesty
and the two Houses how the Church shall be governed after the said three years
or sooner, if differences may be agreed. Touching the Covenant, His Majesty is
not yet therein satisfied, and desires to respite His particular answer
thereunto until His coming to London, because it being a matter of conscience
He cannot give a resolution therein till He may be assisted with the advice of
some of His own Chaplains (which has hitherto been denied Him) and such other
Divines as shall be most proper to inform Him therein; and then He will make
clearly appear, both His zeal to the Protestant profession, and the Union of
these two Kingdoms, which He conceives to be the main drift of this Covenant.
To the seventh and eighth Propositions, His Majesty will consent. To the ninth,
His Majesty doubts not but to give good satisfaction when He shall be
particularly informed how the said penalties shall be levied and disposed of.
To the tenth, His Majesty's answer is, That He has been always ready to
prevent the practices of Papists, and therefore is content to pass an Act of
Parliament for that purpose; And also, that the Laws against them be duly
executed. His Majesty will give His consent to the Act for the due observation
of the Lords Day, for the suppressing of Innovations, and those concerning the
Preaching of Gods Word, and touching Non-Residence and Pluralities, and His
Majesty will yield to such Act or Acts as shall be requisite to raise moneys
for the payment and satisfying all public Debts, expecting also that his will
be therein included. As to the Proposition touching the Militia, though his
Majesty cannot consent unto it in terminis as it is proposed, because thereby
he conceives, he wholly parts with the power of the Sword entrusted to him by
God and the Laws of the Land, for the protection and government of his people,
thereby at once devesting himself, and dis-inheriting his Posterity of that
right and prerogative of the Crown, which is absolutely necessary to the
Kingly Office, and so weaken Monarchy in this Kingdom, that little more then
the name and shadow of it will remain: yet if it be only security for the
preservation of the Peace of this Kingdom, after the unhappy troubles, and the
due performance of all the agreements which are now to be concluded, which is
desired, (which his Majesty always understood to be the case, and hopes that
herein he is not mistaken) his Majesty will give abundant satisfaction, to
which end he is willing by Act of Parliament, That the whole power of the
Militia, both by Sea and Land for the space of ten years be in the hands of
such persons as the two Houses shall nominate, giving them power during the
said term to change the said persons, and substitute others in their places at
pleasure, and afterward to return to the proper channel again, as it was in
the times of Queen Elizabeth and King James of blessed memory. And now His
Majesty conjures His two Houses of Parliament, as they are Englishmen and
lovers of Peace, by the duty they owe to His Majesty their King, and by the
bowels of compassion they have to their fellow Subjects, that they will accept
of this his Majesty's offer, whereby the joyful news of Peace may be restored
to this languishing Kingdom. His Majesty will grant the like to the Kingdom of
Scotland if it be desired, and agree to all things that are propounded touching
the conserving of peace betwixt the two Kingdoms.

Touching Ireland (other things being agreed) His Majesty will give
satisfaction therein. As to the mutual Declarations proposed to be established
in both Kingdoms by Act of Parliament, And the Modifications, Qualifications,
and Branches which follow in the Propositions, His Majesty only professes, that
He does not sufficiently understand, nor is able to reconcile many things
contained in them; but this He well knows, That a general Act of Oblivion is
the best Bond of Peace; and that after intestine Troubles, the wisdom of this
and other Kingdoms has usually and happily in all ages granted general
Pardons, whereby the numerous discontentments of many Persons and Families
otherwise exposed to ruin, might not become fuel to new disorders, or seeds
to future troubles. His Majesty therefore desires, that His two Houses of
Parliament would seriously descend into these considerations, and likewise
tenderly look upon His Condition herein, and the perpetual dishonor that must
cleave to Him, if He shall thus abandon so many persons of Condition and Fortune
that have engaged themselves with and for Him, out of a sense of Duty, and
propounds as a very acceptable testimony of their affection to Him, That a
general Act of Oblivion and free Pardon be forthwith passed by Act of
Parliament. Touching the new great Seal, His Majesty is very willing to confirm
both it, and all the Acts done by virtue thereof, until this present time, so
that it be not thereby pressed to make void those Acts of His done by virtue of
His great Seal, which in honor and justice He is obliged to maintain; And that
the future Government thereof may be in his Majesty, according to the due course
of Law. Concerning the Officers mentioned in the 19. Article, His Majesty when
he shall come to Westminster will gratify his Parliament all that possibly he
may, without destroying the alterations which are necessary for the Crown. His
Majesty will willingly consent to the Act for the confirmation of the
Privileges and Customs of the City of London, and all that is mentioned in
the Propositions for their particular advantage. And now that His Majesty has
thus far endeavored to comply with the desires of His two Houses of
Parliament, to the end that this agreement may be firm and lasting, without
the least face or question of restraint to blemish the same, His Majesty
earnestly desires presently to be admitted to His Parliament at Westminster,
with that Honor which is due to their Sovereign, there solemnly to confirm the
same, and legally to pass the Acts before mentioned, and to give and receive
as well satisfaction in all the remaining particulars, as likewise such other
pledges of mutual love, trust, and confidence as shall most concern the good
of him, and his people; upon which happy agreement, his Majesty will dispatch
his Directions to the Prince his Son, to return immediately to him, and will
undertake for his ready obedience thereunto.

Holdenby, May 12. 1647. For the Speaker of the House of Peers pro tempore, To
be Communicated to the two Houses of Parliament at Westminster, and the
Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland.

WHen our Savior was tempted in the wilderness, He was (as Saint Mark says)
among the wild beasts there; so was our Sovereign (as it seems) at Holdenby:
but these were worse mannered to the King, then those other were to Christ, and
less civil a great deal; for these were men degenerated into Beasts, which of
all others are the most savage; we see in the beginning of this Message, with
what barbarity, and inhumanity they behaved themselves toward Him, their Lord
and Master, who by Gods appointment had the just right and Dominion over them:
they kept His Servants from having access unto Him, not suffering one of His
own Election to come near Him: they declared it a crime for any of mankind to
converse or speak with Him, to give any Letters to Him, or to receive any from
Him: no commerce must He have with any Creature, but only such as were His
tormenters, and tempters, subservient to them, or allowed by them: in brief,
they would not let Him be Master of those ordinary Actions, which belonged to
any freeborn man, of how mean a birth soever: insomuch that His Majesty may
surely say, He had to do with Beasts at Holdenby in the shape of men, and
fought with them, as Saint Paul did at Ephesus.

But (behold) for all this, though they forgot themselves to be Subjects, and
(indeed) men, yet He remembers Himself still to be the Father of His People;
and though His Condition under them might make Him silent, and His usage by
them, might harden His heart against them, and stir His spirit to plot revenge
upon them; and to this end, to study the winding Himself out of His Troubles by
indirect means; and that were (as Himself tells them) by consenting readily, to
what had, or should be proposed unto Him, and choose a time afterward to break
all, and allege that forced Concessions are not to be kept, which (he is
confident) He might do without incurring any hard censure from indifferent men.

But His Majesty's spirit is too Kingly and divine, to practice according to
such maxims: for though (indeed) no compulsions or violence shall be able to
wrest from Him any Concessions against Conscience, or in clear reason against
the good and welfare of His people; yet He avows freely and clearly that He
holds it not only unlawful, but base, to recede from His promises (if once
passed) for having been obtained by force, or under restraint: wherefore His
Majesty not only rejects all those Acts which He esteems unworthy of Him, but
even passes by that point of Honor, which He might well insist upon, in
respect of His present Condition, and consents as we see so far to all their
Propositions, as in Conscience and Reason He conceived might possibly be done,
in order to His peoples welfare, though to the great diminution of His own
undoubted prerogative, and most just rights: for example, He knows well and
acknowledges (as we see) the power of the Sword is entrusted to Him by God and
the Law, to Protect and Govern His people, and is absolutely necessary to the
Kingly Office, yet to secure the Kingdom of peace on His behalf, and the
performance of agreements on His part, (which by reason of the wrongs done Him
was so much suspected,) He not only offers the whole power of the Militia both
by Sea and Land to be in the whole disposal of the two Houses of Parliament
for ten years space, but also entreats them (after all this their ill usage of
Him) and conjures them, as Englishmen, and lovers of Peace, by the duty they
owe Him, as their King, and by the Bowels of Compassion which they have to
their Fellow Subjects, to accept of this His offer, whereby the joyful news of
Peace may be restored (at length) to this languishing Kingdom.

Nay, and further (as we see in this Message) notwithstanding they had grieved
His spirit by their unparalleld abuses, and offended Him above seventy times
seven times, and never hitherto so much as said, it repents us; yet does His
most gracious Majesty even urge upon them, (for the prevention of new
disorders, and future troubles) to accept of a pardon at His Hand for all the
wrongs which they had done Him, and to admit of an Act of oblivion, as the best
bond of peace: only He would have them deny their Corruptions so far, as to
cease thirsting for the blood and total ruin of those of their Christian
Brethren (whom they had well nigh undone already) for their love and adherence
to Himself, according to their duties, as Gods Word, the Law, their
Consciences, Oaths of Allegiance and Protestation did command them: He desires
(in effect) that their spleens may rest satisfied with the wrongs already
offered to these persons, and their families, lest their discontent might happily
prove fuel to new d^sorders: He would have the Act of Oblivion to include
them too: Yea, He would have these men (who indeed only need it) to consent
that it might reach to all the people of the Land in general; (this is all He
desires of them,) that so from henceforth we might live together like
Christians; and not like Heathens, like savage Creatures, or rather like devils
any longer, as (alas) we have done (to the unspeakable disgrace of the Gospel
and of our Nation) since these men domineered: And to the end, that there might
not be the least face or question of His Majesty's restraint to blemish this
agreement to their disadvantage in aftertimes, He earnestly desires that
Himself might presently be admitted to His two Houses; (after all this, His
compliance) to perfect the same:

And now surely, we must needs conclude that here was enough to still the
Clamor of these men against their King (had they not been far worse then
beasts) and to have conquered their spirits even to everlasting: But they were
resolute in their way, all this was nothing in their esteem; for indeed the
established and fundamental Laws of the Land, are so severe against such as go
in those ways and courses which these have travailed so far in, against the
King and their fellow subjects; that they dare not trust either to his mercy,
or their forgiveness, be the same never so strongly confirmed unto them; nor
can any Act of Oblivion in their conceits) be ever able to obliterate the same:
and therefore as if He had offered nothing at all, they still cry out, that His
Majesty is averse to Peace, and never yet pleased to accept of any Tender sit
for them to make, nor to offer any fit for them to receive: and they Preachers
are still set a work by them to pray before the people, that God would incline
the Kings heart to come unto His Parliament.

But these men not knowing how to answer His Majesty (saving their own stubborn
resolutions,) or to say any thing to these His so large and gracious tenders,
they even suffer Him after their old wont, to wait, and to live in expectation.

And yet we found (or at least supposed at that time) that His Majesty's Answer
to some of these Propositions, viz. to those that concerned Religion or Church
Government, had some effect upon the Independent party, whose boiling
discontents about this time began to vapor forth more furiously then before,
against their Presbyterian Brethren; whose Government and Directory His Majesty
had here promised to confirm for three years, (the time set down by the two
Houses) so that Himself and His, might not be hindered thereby in serving God
the old and true way; now upon this, the untamed Heighfers of this other
faction, altogether unaccustomed to the yoke; having observed that their
Brethrens little singer was like to prove heavier then the Bishops loins: were
horribly loath to come under the sense of their Scorpions, and therefore began
to cast about for themselves, and to devise a prevention of this three years
confirmation, lest they should feel the lash so long, and be kept under worse
then an Egyptian Bondage: and in order to this, they began to find fault (as
there was cause) at the Presbyterians ill usage of the King, (for they indeed
were His chief Tormenters at Holdenby; Master Marshall and his fellow-Minister
being then also of that faction, because at that time it was the most
prevailing) they exclaimed on them for handling His Majesty so hardly, in
keeping Him as a Prisoner, denying Him the freedom of His Conscience, and
service of His Chaplains: they remembered also with much regret of spirit (as
then seemed) the wicked tenants of Buchanan, Knox, and others, the erectors and
propugnators of the Presbyterian Discipline in Scotland, about excommunicating,
deposing, arraigning, and killing Princes: and their practices against James
his Grandmother, his Mother, and himself in his Infancy; and they did plainly
observe (as themselves said) by the carriages of these Presbyterians toward
His Majesty at this present, that they resolved to tread in the same steps, as
their predecessors had done before, notwithstanding their so many solemn
professions and protestations to the Contrary: And hereupon they said they
thought it their duty (according to their first engagement in this war) to
bring the King to His Parliament with Safety and Honor, that He might enjoy
the just rights of His Crown, as well as of His Conscience; largely promising
and protesting to be instruments of the same, to the content of His Majesty and
the whole Kingdom; and upon these pretenses the King was delivered by them
from that particular thraldom at Holdenby: And afterward brought with the
applause and joy of His people, to His Manor of Hampton, where His Servants,
and Chaplains at first were allowed access to Him, and many of His Subjects
permitted to glad their hearts with the sight of Him. And this gleame of
prosperity blazed well till the Houses were thinned of the chief Heads of the
contrary faction: for in very deed all this was done to another end then was
pretended, and ordered by other Councels then yet appeared; it being the nature
of some men to envy that any should be more injurious then themselves, or have
a greater hand in acting evil then they. There were in the Houses (and
elsewhere) some Grandees, (as they are since called) that were ambitious of
engrossing the sole power over King and Kingdom, which others as yet had as
large a share in managing of (if not a larger) then themselves, to exclude whom
they made use of the Independent humor in the inferior Officers and
Soldiers, laid the plot for them, in that manner as it was acted, secretly
provoked them to the undertaking, and countenanced them in it, when it was
done, by pretending to be of their Religion; clouding their maine Design, all
the while from the body of the Army; whom they set a work to make certain
Proposals, partly in their own behalf, and partly tending to those things
which had been promised to the King; while themselves in the interim, were
dressing, or making ready to act the very same part, which those they disliked
had done before; and had been thus intermitted for a season, till those others
were ejected or cast overboard: for the very same Propositions in Effect, that
had formerly assaulted His Majesty at Newcastle, and were answered by Him from
Holdenby (as we have seen) are (to renew His trouble) remitted to Him: which
His Majesty returns Answer unto, in these words,

His Majesty's seventeenth Message.
His Majesty's most gracious Answer to the Propositions, presented to Him at
Hampton Court.
CHARLES R.

HIs Majesty cannot choose but be passionately sensible (as He believes all His
good Subjects are) of the late great distractions, and still languishing and
unsettled state of this Kingdom; and He calls God to witness, and is willing
to give testimony to all the world of His readiness to contribute His utmost
endeavors for restoring it to a happy and flourishing condition. His Majesty
having perused the Propositions now brought to Him, finds them the same in
effect, which were offered to Him at Newcastle. To some of which as He could
not then consent without violation of His Conscience and Honor; So neither can
He agree to others, now conceiving them in many respects more disagreeable to
the present condition of affairs, then when they were formerly presented unto
Him, as being destructive to the main principal Interests of the Army, and of
all those, whose Affections concur with them. And His Majesty having seen the
Proposals of the Army to the Commissioners from His two Houses residing with
them, and with them to be treated on, in order to the clearing and securing of
the Rights and Liberties of the Kingdom, and the settling of a just and lasting
Peace. To which Proposals, as He conceives His two Houses not to be strangers;
So He believes they will think with Him, that they much more conduce to the
satisfaction of all Interests, and may be a fitter foundation for a lasting
Peace, then the Propositions which at this time are tendered unto Him. He
therefore propounds (as the best way in His judgment in order to a Peace) That
His two Houses would instantly take into consideration those Proposals, upon
which there may be a Personal Treaty with His Majesty, and upon such other
Propositions as his Majesty shall make: hoping that the said Propositions may be
so moderated in the said Treaty, as to render them the more capable of his
Majesty's full concession: Wherein He resolves to give full satisfaction to His
people, for whatsoever shall concern the settling of the Protestant Profession,
with liberty to tender Consciences, and the securing of the Laws, Liberties and
Properties of all His Subjects, and the just Privileges of Parliaments for the
future: and likewise by His present deportment in this Treaty, He will make the
world clearly judge of his intentions in matters of future Government. In which
Treaty His Majesty will be well pleased (if it be thought fit) that
Commissioners from the Army, (whose the Proposals are) may likewise be
admitted. His Majesty therefore conjures his two Houses of Parliament, by the
duty they owe to God, and his Majesty their King, and by the bowels of
compassion they have to their fellow subjects, both for the relief of their
present sufferings, and to prevent future miseries, that they will forthwith
accept of this his Majesty's Offer, whereby the joyful news of Peace may be
restored to this distressed Kingdom; And for what concerns the Kingdom of
Scotland mentioned in the Propositions, his Majesty will very willingly Treat
upon those particulars with the Scotch Commissioners; and doubts not, but to
give reasonable satisfaction to that his Kingdom.

At Hampton Court the 9. of September. 1647. For the Speaker of the House of
Peers pro tempore, to be communicated, etc.

It appears by this Message of His Majesty, and more fully by the
Propositions themselves, which it relates unto, that the Tragedy is still the
same, the variation is only of the Actors, not of the Scene: Nor did those
Pharisees desire his death and downfall more, then these Saduces do, and will
endeavor to prevent His Resurrection. It Is the same Leven that sowres both
factions, and the controversy between them only is, which shall be the chief,
or have most strength to express most sowrenesse.

But His Majesty finds a difference in the present condition of Affairs, from
what they were at the former presentment of these Propositions; for they seemed
to be totally destructive to the interests of the Army, (now more manifest to
Him then before) whom His Majesty was pleased to look on (at this present) not
only as Subjects, but as Friends; and being desirous in His Princely care and
equity (as a common Father) to give satisfaction to all His people, does (as we
see) in His wisdom and public affections answer accordingly; and since the
Army had been their Servants and Hirelings (though against Himself their
natural Liege Lord) yet He thinks it meet in His Fatherly Clemency not only to
pass by what they had done, (as acts of ignorance in them) but also to
endeavor that they be paid their wages; and to this end commends their case
and Proposalls, to those their Masters who had employed them, and sent these
Propositions unto Him: And that all parties may have content, He desires again
a Personal Treaty with them for Peace, whereunto He is well pleased (for His
part) if it be thought fit (as he says) that Commissioners from the Army may
also be admitted; that so without more ado, a clear, open, and full
satisfaction might be given to all parties: And sure the Soldiers, as well as
the rest of his abused, and deluded people, will find in the end, that the King
will prove their best friend and play master; who in the mean time (as they may
observe) makes Himself even a Petitioner in their behalf, to His two Houses;
whom He conjures again (as He had done often before) by the duty they owe to
God, to Himself their King, and by the bowels of compassion which they have
(or ought to have) to their fellow subjects; to give way, that their present
sufferings may be relieved, their future miseries prevented, and the joyful
news of Peace again restored.

But this request and conjuration of His Majesty at the present, found no other
respect with the new purged Houses, then His other before had done, when (by
their own confessions) these Houses were so filthy and unclean: indeed the
purging was not completely done, according to the Law of clensing, for the
Leprosy that has so troubled us all, was (as now appears) spread to the very
walls, and stones, and mortar it self, all which should have been taken away,
and other stones and mortar put in the place thereof, that is, New Houses
should have been thoroughly framed of new materials, and so the Plague might
have been quite healed, which upon this default grew worse ere long, then it
had been before, as if the evil spirit had been only thrust out, to fetch in
seven more spirits worse, and more wicked then himself: for not long after His
Majesty had sent this last Message or Answer, He was forced back to His former
Condition of Captivity, He is circled with Armies, watched by Soldiers, yea
has strict and strange guards set and doubled upon Him, and His servants that
were formerly admitted, excluded from Him. In a word, He is reduced to the same
(if not to a worse) condition by his Deliverers at Hampton Court, then that was
which they pretended to free him from at Holdenby. For some amongst them
whisperingly threatened also his sudden destruction, and to act the Assassinates
part upon His Sacred Person: Whereupon for the safety of His life, He was
forced to retire speedily, and privately from that place and in the night
season, when the weather was wet, cold, stormy tempestuous; at which time He
left this ensuing Declaration behind Him on the Table, which speaks
abundantly, His great wisdom, and strong affections toward the Peace and
Happiness of all His People, not excepting His very Enemies, notwithstanding
His Barbarous and Hard usage at their Hands.

His Majesty's eighteenth Message.
His Majesty's most Gracious Declaration, left by Him on His Table at Hampton
Court, November. 11. 1647.
CHARLES R.

LIberty being that which in all times has been, but especially now is the
common theme and desire of all men; common Reason shows, that Kings less then
any should endure captivity. And yet, I call God and the world to witness,
with what patience I have endured a tedious restraint: which so long as I had
any hopes that this sort of my suffering might conduce to the peace of my
Kingdoms, or the hindering of more effusion of blood, I did willingly undergo:
but now finding by too certain proofs, that this my continued patience would
not only turn to my personal ruin, but likewise be of much more prejudice,
then furtherance to the public good; I thought I was bound as well by
Natural, as Political obligations, to seek my safety, by retiring my self for
some time, from the public view both of my friends and enemies: And I appeal
to all indifferent men, to judge, if I have not just cause to free my self
from the hands of those, who change their Principles with their condition; and
who are not ashamed openly to intend the destruction of the Nobility, taking
away their Negative Voice; and with whom, the Levellers doctrine, is rather
countenanced then punished: And as for their intentions to my Person, their
changing, and putting more strict Guards upon me, with the discharging most of
all those Servants of mine, who formerly they willingly admitted to wait upon
me, does sufficiently declare. Nor would I have this my retirement
mis-interpreted; for I shall earnestly and uncessantly endeavor the settling of
a safe and well-grounded Peace, where ever I am or shall be; and that (as much
as may be) without the effusion of more Christian blood: for which how many
times have I desired, pressed to be heard, and yet no ear given to me? And can
any reasonable man think, that (according to the ordinary course of affairs)
there can be a settled Peace without it? Or that God will bless those, who
refuse to hear their own King? Surely no. Nay I must farther add, that
(besides what concerns my self) unless all other chief interests, have not
only a hearing, but likewise just satisfaction given unto them, (to wit, the
Presbyterians, Independents, Army, those who have adhered to me, and even the
Scots) I say there cannot (I speak not of Miracles, it being in my opinion, a
sinful presumption, in such cases, to expect or trust to them) be a safe or
lasting Peace.

Now as I cannot deny, but that my personal security is the urgent cause of
this my retirement; so I take God to witness, that the public Peace is no
less before my eyes: and I can find no better way to express this my
profession (I know not what a wiser may do) then by desiring and urging that
all chief Interests may be heard, to the end each may have just satisfaction:
As for example, the Army, (for the rest, though necessary, yet I suppose are
not difficult to content) ought (in my judgment) to enjoy the liberty of their
consciences, have an Act of Oblivion or Indemnity (which should extend to all
the rest of my Subjects) and that all their Arrears should be speedily and duly
paid; which I will undertake to do, so I may be heard, and that I be not
hindered from using such lawful and honest means as I shall choose. To conclude,
let me be heard with Freedom, Honor and Safety, and I shall instantly break
through this Cloud of Retirement, and show my self really to be Pater Patriae.

Hampton Court, November. 11. 1647. For the Speaker of the House of Peers pro
tempore, To be Communicated to the two Houses of Parliament at Westminster, and
the Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland.

HE that reads His Majesty in these His Messages and Declarations, and
considers well the discovery made therein of His disposition, must needs
conclude, that never King since Christ's time, was endued with more of Christ's
spirit.

In this Declaration we observe among many other things worthy our special
notice, three particulars.

1. His Majesty's most Christian and fatherly Affection to us all in general,
How like a truly good Shepherd He did willingly undergo and endure a most
tedious restraint, so long as He had hopes that the same might conduce any
thing to our peace, and prevent the further effusion of our Blood: but when He
saw by certain proofs, that His continued patience was likely to turn only to
His Personal ruin, whereby ours, and that of the public would certainly be
hastened: He thought Himself bound to endeavor His peoples safety by His own,
in retiring for some time from public view.

2. His Majesty's great care of preserving the being of the English Nobility
whose destruction he perceived was openly intended, as well as His; by those
that aimed at the taking away their Negative voice. Had those of them, who have
so shamefully degenerated with the times from the dignity of their Ancestors,
been as careful of His Honor and Rights, as He (we see) is and has been of
theirs: both He, and they, and we all, had not been so miserable at this
present; when God shall lay this sin unto their Charge, woe, woe, woe, will be
unto them.

3. His Majesty's fervent desire that all Interests may be Heard, and just
satisfaction given to them; the Presbyterians, Independants, Army, Scots and
all, who have combined together and engaged against Him as well as those who had
adhered to Him; and yet none of them (except those) had evidenced any full
readiness of mind that might be restored to those His rights which God and the
Law commands should be given to Him.

Concerning Himself, we observe He desires but only to be Heard, and that for
these two Ends: first to procure peace for His people, which is not probably
otherwise to be settled; and Secondly, to prevent Gods Curse from falling upon
His Gainsayers which otherwise is most likely to overwhelme them: His words (we
see) are these, Can any reasonable man think that (according to the ordinary
course of affairs) there can be a settled peace without it? or that God will
bless those who refuse to hear their own King? Surely no. May His Majesty
obtain but hopes of this, He will instantly break through His cloud of
Retirement, and show Himself really to be, (as indeed He has always been)
Pater patriae.

But can His Majesty conceal His Affection so long? can He forbear soliciting
His peoples peace till Himself be Heard? it is impossible, no, no, He cannot
contain Himself seven days from returning to His former labor in vain, or
fruitless endeavors; but sets immediately to the same again so soon at He
arrived at the Isle of Wight* the place of His retirement, though whether
destined so to be, by His own choice, or others designation, time will
discover: But it plainly appears, His Majesty had a good opinion of the Army in
General, in His not removing quite from among them, and of the Governor of
that place in particular, or else being in a free or open road, and in the
night season, He might easily have turned some other way: He removed from
Hampton Court, November. the 11. and on the 17. of the same Month, He writes from
Wight this which follows.

His Majesty's nineteenth Message.
His Majesty's most Gracious Message from the Isle of Wight: for a Personal
Treaty for Peace.
CHARLES R.

HIs Majesty is confident that before this time, His two Houses of Parliament
have received the Message which He left behind Him at Hampton Court the
eleventh of this Month, by which they will have understood the reasons which
enforced Him to go from thence, as likewise His constant endeavors, for the
settling of a safe and wel-grounded Peace wheresoever He should be; And being
now in a place, where He conceives Himself to be at much more freedom and
security then formerly; He thinks it necessary (not only for making good of His
own professions, but also for the speedy procuring of a Peace in these
languishing and distressed Kingdoms) at this time to offer such grounds to His
two Houses for that effect; which upon due examination of all Interests, may
best conduce thereunto.

And because Religion is the best and chiefest foundation of Peace, His Majesty
will begin with that Particular.

That for the abolishing Archbishops, Bishops, etc. His Majesty clearly
professes, that He cannot give His consent thereunto, both in relation as He
is a Christian, and a King: For the first, He avows that He is satisfied in His
Judgment, that this order was placed in the Church by the Apostles themselves;
and ever since their time, has continued in all Christian Churches throughout
the world, until this last century of years; And in this Church in all times
of Change and Reformation, it has been upheld by the wisdom of His
Ancestors, as the great preserver of Doctrine, Discipline, and Order in the
service of God. As a King at His Coronation, He has not only taken a Solemn
Oath, to maintain this Order, but His Majesty and His Predecessors in their
confirmations of the Great Charter, have inseperably woven the right of the
Church into the Liberties of the rest of the Subjects: And yet He is willing,
it be provided that the particular Bishops perform the several Duties of their
callings, both by their personal residence and frequent Preachings in their
Diocesses, as also that they exercise no act of Jurisdiction or Ordination,
without the consent of their Presbyters; And will consent, that their Powers in
all things be so limited, that they be not grievous to tender Consciences:
Wherefore, since His Majesty is willing to give ease to the Consciences of
others, He sees no reason why He alone, and those of His Judgment, should be
Pressed to a violation of theirs. Nor can His Majesty consent to the Alienation
of Church Lands, because it cannot be denied to be a sin of the highest
Sacrilege; as also, that it subverts the intentions of so many pious Donors,
who have laid a heavy curse upon all such profane violations, which His Majesty
is very unwilling to undergo; And besides the matter of Conscience, His
Majesty believes it to be a prejudice to the Public good, many of His Subjects
having the benefit of renewing Leases at much easier Rates, then if those
possessions were in the hands of private men; not omitting the discouragement
which it will be to all learning and industry, when such eminent rewards shall
be taken away, which now lie open to the Children of meanest Persons.

Yet His Majesty considering the great present distempers concerning Church
Discipline, and that the Presbyterian Government is now in practice, His
Majesty to eschew confusion as much as may be, and for the satisfaction of His
two Houses, is content that the said Government be legally permitted to stand,
in the same condition it now is for three years; Provided, that His Majesty and
those of His Judgment (or any other who cannot in Conscience submit thereunto)
be not obliged to comply with the Presbyter all Government, but have free
practice of their own Profession, without receiving any prejudice thereby; and
that a free consultation and debate be had with the Divines at Westminster
(twenty of His Majesty's nomination being added unto them) whereby it may be
determined by His Majesty and the two Houses, how the Church Government after
the said time shall be settled, (or sooner if differences may be agreed) as is
most agreeable to the Word of God; with full liberty to all those who shall
differ upon conscientious grounds from that setlement; always provided, that
nothing aforesaid be understood to tolerate those of the Popish Profession, nor
the exempting of any Popish Recusant from the penalties of the Laws, or to
tolerate the public profession of Atheism or Blaspemy, contrary to the
doctrine of the Apostles, Nicene and Athanasian Creeds, they having been
received by, and had in reverence of all the Christian Churches, and more
particularly by this of England, ever since the Reformation.

Next, the Militia being that right, which is inseparably and undoubtedly
inherent in the Crown, by the Laws of this Nation, and that which former
Parliaments, as likewise this, has acknowledged so to be; His Majesty cannot
so much wrong that trust which the Laws of God and this Land has annexed to
the Crown for the protection and security of his People, as to divest Himself
and Successors of the power of the Sword: yet to give an infallible evidence
of His desire to secure the performance of such agreements as shall be made in
order to a Peace, his Majesty will consent to an Act of Parliament, that the
whole power of the Militia both by Sea and Land, for and during his whole
Reign, shall be ordered and disposed by his two Houses of Parliament, or by
such persons as they shall appoint, with powers limited for suppressing of
Forces within this Kingdom, to the disturbance of the public Peace, and
against foreign Invasion; and that they shall have power during his said
Reign, to raise Moneys for the purposes aforesaid; and that neither his
Majesty that now is, or any other (by any authority derived only from him)
shall execute any of the said Powers during his Majesty's said Reign, but such
as shall act by the consent and approbation of the two Houses of Parliament:
Nevertheless his Majesty intends that all Patents, Commissions, and other Acts
concerning the Militia, be made and acted as formerly; and that after his
Majesty's Reign, all the power of the Militia shall return entirely to the
Crown, as it was in the times of Q. Elizabeth, and K. James of blessed memory.

After this head of the Militia, the consideration of the Arrears due to the
Army is not improper to follow; for the payment whereof, and the ease of his
People, his Majesty is willing to concur in any thing that can be done without
the violation of his Conscience and Honor. Wherefore if his two Houses shall
consent to remit unto him such benefit out of Sequestations from Michaelmas
last, and out of Compositions that shall be made before the concluding of the
peace, and the Arrears of such as have been already made, the assistance of the
Clergy, and the Arrears of such Rents of his own Revenue as his two Houses
shall not have received before the concluding of the Peace, his Majesty will
undertake within the space of eighteen Months, the payment of four hundred
thousand pounds for the satisfaction of the Army: And if those means shall not
be sufficient, his Majesty intends to give way to the sale of Forest Lands for
that purpose, this being the Public Debt which in his Majesty's judgment is
first to be satisfied; and for other public debts already contracted upon
Church Lands or any other Engagements, his Majesty will give his consent to
such Act or Acts for raising of Moneys for payment thereof as both Houses shall
hereafter agree upon, so as they be equally laid, whereby his people (already
too heavily burdened by these late distempers) may have no more pressures upon
them then this absolute necessity requires: And for the further securing of all
fears, his Majesty will consent, that an Act of Parliament be passed for the
disposing of the great Offices of State, and naming of Privy Counselors for
the whole term of his Reign by the two Houses of Parliament, their Patents
and Commissions being taken from his Majesty, and after to return to the Crown,
as is expressed in the Article of the Militia. For the Court of Wards and
^iveries, his Majesty very well knows the consequence of taking that away, by
turning of all Tenures into common Soccage, as well in point of Revenue to the
Crown, as in the Protection of many of his Subjects being Infants.
Nevertheless if the continuance thereof seem grievous to His Subjects, rather
then he will fail on His part in giving satisfaction, He will consent to an Act
for taking of it away, so as a full recompense be settled upon His Majesty and
his Successors in perpetuity, and that the Arrears now due be reserved unto
Him toward the payment of the Arrears of the Army.

And that the memory of these late distractions may be wholly wiped away, His
Majesty will consent to an Act of Parliament for the suppressing and making
null of all Oaths, Declarations and Proclamations against both or either House
of Parliament, and of all Indictments and other proceedings against any persons
for adhering unto them; and His Majesty proposes, (as the best expedient to
take away all seeds of future differences) that there be an Act of Oblivion to
extend to all His Subjects.

As for Ireland, the Cessation there is long since determined, but for the
future (all other things being fully agreed) His Majesty will give full
satisfaction to his Houses concerning that Kingdom.

And although His Majesty cannot consent in Honor and Justice to avoid all His
own Grants and Acts past under His Great Seal since the 22 of May, 1642. or to
the confirming of all the Acts and Grants passed under that made by the two
Houses, yet His Majesty is confident, that upon perusal of particulars, He
shall give full satisfaction to His two Houses, to what may be reasonably
desired in that particular.

And now His Majesty conceives that by these His offers (which He is ready to
make good upon the setlement of a Peace) He has clearly manifested His
intentions to give full security and satisfaction to all Interests, for what
can justly be desired in order to the future happiness of His people. And for
the perfecting of these Concessions, as also for such other things as may be
proposed by the two Houses, and for such just and reasonable demands as his
Majesty shall find necessary to propose on His part, He earnestly desires a
Personal Treaty at London with His two Houses, in Honor, Freedom and Safety,
it being in His judgment the most proper, and indeed, only means to a firm and
settled Peace, and impossible without it to reconcile former, or avoid future
misunderstandings.

All these things being by Treaty perfected, His Majesty believes His two
Houses will think it reasonable, that the Proposals of the Army concerning the
Succession of Parliaments and their due Elections, should be taken into
consideration.

As for what concerns the Kingdom of Scotland, His Majesty will very readily
apply Himself to give all reasonable satisfaction, when the desires of the two
Houses of Parliament on their behalf, or of the Commissioners of that Kingdom,
or of both joined together, shall be made known unto Him.

CHARLES R.
From the Isle of Wight, November. 17. 1647. To the Speaker of the House of Peers
pro tempore, to be communicated to the two Houses of Parliament at Westminster,
and to the Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland.

WE see at the beginning of this Message, that His Majesty conceived Himself to
be at much more freedom and security in that place, then formerly: Had the
Governor there been a true Gentleman in the least degree, he would rather have
lost his life, then crossed His Majesty's opinion in that particular; but we
are confirmed by Him, in what we knew before, that swordmen in these days, are
not all men of Honesty, nor yet of Honor.

His Majesty being now in His own apprehension, at more freedom, renews His
motions for the purchase of peace, that his jealous and hardhearted Chapmen (if
possible) might be cured of all their fears, in seeing now, that His profers
before, were not the fruits of restraint, but of Hearty will and Affections to
His languishing and distressed Kingdoms.

And first, His Majesty (in this Message) declares His Conscience and Reasons,
why He cannot consent to the total Alteration of that Church Government, which
He had sworn to maintain; and they without any Conscience or Reasons at all
would force Him to destroy. Doubtless if there were a necessity, that it must
be as they would have it, yet would it better become them to endeavor His
Majesty's satisfaction in the matter, and to Answer His Reasons, then to urge
him with violence to go against both; and when they see He dares not for
offending God, yet to bawl and clamor against Him without shame or Honesty, as
if He made no Conscience at all of His Oath taken at His Coronation.

But what necessity is there of pulling up this pale of Government, save only
to let wild beasts into Gods vineyard? surely if his Majesty were not confirmed
in His Judgment, that this pale was of the Apostles setting, and cherished in
all Christian Churches, since their times ( till this last Century of years)
and upheld in this particular Church since the Reformation, as the special
preserver of Doctrine and order in Gods Worship: and if He had not taken an
Oath at His Coronation, to maintain it; and though the rights of the Church
were not so woven as they be in the great Charter of the Kingdom, with the
Liberties of the rest of His Subjects; yet as He is a King and protector of
Christ's Religion, as He is a nursing Father of His Church, beholding the
present destruction and vastation of both, by those swarms of Heretics and
Schismatics, which have abounded within these seven years, since the Execution
of this Government has been suspended; He ought in Conscience and Prudence to
endeavor the continuance of it, it being by the confession of its greatest
Adversaries, ( viz. the Smectymnists) first established to suppress and
prevent these very mischiefs.

His Majesty will see that Bishops do their duties, and that all abuses in the
Government be amended, which no question but the Tryenniall Parliament will
also look unto, (if the Kingdom might but be blessed with it.) And that the
present Enemies of this Government may have both time and occasion to think
better of their own demands in their cooler temper: His Majesty is willing to
let them for their own parts to try three years how well they can thrive
without it, hoping that their Mistress Experience, may have taught them by that
time, in the want of this Government, the necessity of the use and continuation
of it; but to consent to the total abolition of that which to Himself and all
sober men is evident to be the most special mean to preserve the life, being,
and beauty of Christ's Church, no men but these that drive Satan's design (if
they well consider of it) can, or will desire it.

2. His Majesty plainly declares, that he dares not be a partaker in that Sin
of the highest Sacrilege, by consenting to the Alienation of Church Lands, nor
venture upon the Curses which hang over the heads of such profane violaters, as
those are and will be, that shall deal in such merchandise; for His Majesty
feared God. Nor can He be induced so much to prejudice the public good, or to
damnifie so many of His Subjects, who farm these Lands (as now held) at far
easier rates then they are like to do, if they should become the possessions
of private men; for the King loves His People. Nor lastly, will He ever be such
an ill friend to learning and industry, as to consent to the taking away of
those rewards which excite and courage thereunto the meanest persons; for our
Sovereign Lord Honors Learning so much, that in relation to that, He will
provide and keep maintenance in store for the Children of His lowest Subjects.

Nay, should His Majesty yield to this Sacrilege, were it not the next way to
destroy Religion as well as Learning? Julian the Apostate, one of the greatest
and subtillest enemies that ever Christianity had, thought it was: And
therefore he endeavoring to extirpate the same, made an Ordinance for the sale
of Church lands, or the taking away of Clergy maintenance; the renewment of
which, might in prudence have been omitted by the pretenders to Christianity of
these days, for Iulians sake.

These be the two things which His Majesty denies His consent unto, Abolition
of Church Government, and Alienation of Church Revenues: and his Reasons for
the same are far better, then any we know he can have, for his yielding those
things which he offers to them; whereof the first is the power of the Militia
both by sea and land, during his own whole reign, which he is content shall
be ordered and disposed of by His two Houses, and such as they shall appoint:
And his Reason for this is, to give an infallible evidence of His desire to
secure the performance of such agreement as shall be made in order to Peace:
Whereby His Majesty seems to us (to speak in their phrase) even to yield up
not only His Will and Affections, but also His very Reason and Judgment, for
the obtaining a good Accommodation.

But concerning the reality of His Majesty's Desires in this particular, the
best of His people neither wish nor need any such evidence; the security is
only doubted and desired on their parts, whom we have seen and found so false
and perfidious already both to the King, and the whole Kingdom. Nor (if it
were possible, this proffer of His Maj. could secure us of them) dare we the
Christian people of this Nation, (whose servants they are) give our consent,
that the Sword should be out of that Hand where God has put it for our good;
for Nolumus hos regnare, we are resolved on that: we will never live under the
tyranny of these men: The Wiseman has said it, and we have found it by
woeful experience, That by the reign of servants, the earth is disquieted.

But God has been much our friend in this matter, in hardening their hearts
against this proffer, which in pity to us his peeled and distressed people, to
purchase peace for us, this our most compassionate and self-denying King was
pleased to tender: and we are with fervor of spirit to praise the Majesty of
heaven for it, it being an earnest, or ground of hope, that he has yet some
mercy in store for this poor Nation; that He will not suffer it to lie under
so heavy a guilt, as the impunity of so much evil would be hazardous to bring
upon it, by an Act of Oblivion. No, no, our God will have these mischievous
vermin destroyed by the sword of Justice, (as we hope) and not of Judgment,
and so shall the curse of God which hangs over the Land for those many
blasph^mies against Majesty, those unlawful oaths, those bloods and
oppressions which have been committed in it by these men be removed from it,
and then the same shall enjoy rest and peace again, under the protection of
her most gracious and indulgent Sovereign. And in the mean time we are to pray
fervently, that this our good King may still afford us his true affections, and
these only, but may from henceforth keep his Will, his Reason and Judgment
solely to himself, yea and his power too; for we are well assured from our
experience both of Him and Them, that He alone is able and ready to manage all
to our benefit, a great deal better then any else either will or can: And God
we hope will incline His Majesty's heart to observe his hand in this constant
temper of their spirits hitherto against all His gracious offers of this nature.

We observe also in the next place, how His Majesty takes into consideration
the Arreares of their Army, or the wants of those Soldiers which they the
raisers of, were more careful to list then they are to pay: their servants we
know they were, raised and employed by them against Him, and now kept together
in a needy and bare condition to burden His people, and to keep them in
continual fear, poverty, and bondage: even this very Army, for their
satisfaction, and His peoples ease, His Majesty offers to take care of: He
thinks in conscience that pay is due unto them, and though they merit it not at
His hands yet being resolved in His mercy and goodness as a Christian to
pardon their fault, He will like a King also, in His bounty and Honor undertake
their payment; which none else (he sees) is really inclined to look after. And
this He will do, without any charge to any, save only to Himself and His
own friends. May He but have His own Rents and Revenues returned to Him, with
some few of the Arreares, together with some little part of that money which
they had gotten by Sequestrations and Compositions from His own party, He will
undertake that the Army in few months shall receive four hundred thousand
pounds; and if that be not sufficient, He will make up the rest by the sale of
His own Lands.

Nay, and more then all this, lest the devouring of that which is Holy, should
prove a snare, and a fire to the greedy and bold adventurers, His Majesty is
willing also to take order against the damage of such persons, and for the
repayment of all such moneys as have by them been lent upon such engagements.

Nor is here all yet, His Majesty is willing to endeavor the reparation of His
Enemies lost reputations, by suppressing and nulling all Declarations and
Protestations, which their own due merits had most justly called forth against
them, and all proceedings anent any person for adhering to them.

And now what could these men (in the judgment of Reason) have desired more
then was here tendered? they might have had the Authority, the whole command and
power of the Militia; they might have possessed all the wealth to themselves
which they had before, or have gotten lately, from the whole Kingdom: His
Majesty would have taken the whole care of paying their debts and their
Servants wages, He would have wiped them also as clean as possibly He could
have done, from their black and hellish crimes of Rebellion* oppression, blood
and Treason: And He would have granted further, what ever else they could have
asked, in order to their own quiet and security, would they but only let Him
come to Treat with them, and suffer His poor people (now at length) to enjoy
an ease from war, and a freedom from their heavy pressures.

Assuredly we may conceive those words of the Prophet, 2 Chr. 25.16. to be
fully appliable to these men: God has even determined to destroy them because
they have not hearkened to this counsel, nor accepted of what was here offered
to them. Scripture teaches, that whom God purposes to make the power of his
justice seen upon, he infatuates, to slight and lose the opportunities of their
own preservation: Elyes sons hearkened not unto the voice of their Father,
because the Lord would slay them (says the Spirit:) God did not incline their
hearts to listen unto good, because he intended to cut them off for their
evils. And such may be thought is the case and condition of these men, they
have not hearkened to this voice or Message of their public Father, because the
Lords purpose is speedily to call them to a shameful reckoning for the
mischiefs they have done: many sclaunders and blasphemies have they cast out
against his Anointed, much peevishness and perverseness have they practiced
toward Him: much of the innocent blood of their fellow subjects and brethren
have they spilt and shed, much oppression have they used upon them, much
hypocrisy to deceive and cheat them of their peace and money; and much
profanation and despite to that Religion and Church, wherein themselves were
bred and nourished; and that for these things sake, the wrath of God might come
suddenly down upon them, as upon the most special Children of disobedience,
the Lord has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts to forsake their
own mercy, in rejecting these motions and proffers of their Sovereign: And we
believe their natures and dispositions are now so well known by these their
refusalls so frequently iterated, by their late Votes or Resolves of having no
more to do with the King, by their scandalous Declaration against His Innocence
and Honor; and by that other of theirs against the Commissioners of Scotland,
that it will be concluded their hour is spent, their day is past and gone,
they shall never more meet with such advantages of preserving themselves, nor
with the like tenders of grace and mercy.

Twenty days did His Majesty (according to His wonted manner) wait their
leisure for an Answer to this His so Gracious Message, and could not so much in
all that time as understand from them their receipt of it; which perverseness
and insolency in them, cannot yet cause Him to forbear again sending to them;
the welfare of His Subjects is so tender to Him, and their Happiness so much
desired by Him: yea the many and sud complaints of the decay of trade, the
dearnesse of commodities, and the unsupportable burden of taxes, ecchoing daily
from diverse parts of His Kingdom into His pious and gentle ears, and
threatening a sudden failing of natural subsistence, will not let Him rest or
desist in His endeavors for peace, though Himself were to have no share in the
benefit of it, and therefore He solicits them again in these words:

His Majesty's twentieth Message.
His Majesty's most gracious Message for Peace from Carisbrooke-Castle, December.
6. 1647.
CHARLES R.

HAd His Majesty thought it possible that His two Houses could be employed in
things of greater concernment then the Peace of this miserable distracted
Kingdom; He would have expected with more patience, their leisure in
acknowledging the receipt of his Message of the 16. of November last. But since
there is not in nature, any consideration preceding to that of Peace, his
Majesty's constant tenderness of the welfare of his Subjects, has such a
prevalence with him, that he cannot forbear he vehement prosecution of a
Personal Treaty: which is, only, so much the more desired by his Majesty, as
it is superior to all other means of Peace. And truly, when his Majesty
considers the several complaints he daily hears from all parts of this
Kingdom, That Trade is so decayed, all Commodities so dear, and Taxes so
insupportable, that even natural subsistence will suddenly fail. His Majesty
(to perform the Trust reposed in him) must use his uttermost endeavors for
Peace, though he were to have no share in the benefit of it. And has not his
Majesty done his part for it, by devesting himself of so much power and
authority, as by his last Message he has promised to do, upon the concluding
of the whole Peace? And has he met with that acknowledgment from his two
Houses, which this great Grace and Favor justly deserves? Surely the blame of
this great retarding of Peace must fall somewhere else, then on his Majesty.

To conclude, If ye will but consider in how little time this necessary good
Work will be done, if you the two Houses will wait on his Majesty with the same
Resolutions for Peace, as he will meet you: he no way doubts, but that ye will
willingly agree to this his Majesty's earnest desire of a Personal Treaty, and
speedily desire his Presence amongst you. Where all things agreed on, being
digested into Acts (till when, it is most unreasonable for his Majesty or his
two Houses to desire, each of other the least concession) this Kingdom may at
last enjoy the blessing of a long-wisht for Peace.

From Carisbrook-Castle, December. 6. 1647. To the Speaker of the House of Peers,
pro tempore, to be communicated, etc.

BEcause His Majesty herein had declared, that this necessary work of Peace may
be concluded in a very little time, were their resolutions out like His, and
also affirmed, that it would be most unreasonable either for Himself or them,
to desire of each other the least Concession, till things agreed on were
digested into Acts, therefore did they make have (more then ever they did
before) to send Him four Bills (fully as unconscionable as could be devised) to
which they resolve to have His Concession, (as unreasonable a thing as He takes
it to be) before He shall get any hopes of a Treaty at their hands: By which
also they give Him to see and know, that how short a time soever, Himself
fancies this necessary work may be done in, yet it is not likely to be concluded
with such speed and easiness: eighteen days after this Message was sent,
those Bills came to His Majesty's hand, of what nature they were, that speech
of one of those that sent them does sufficiently discover: If the King signs
them, He undoes Himself; if He does not, We will: the world has seen them, His
Majesty's Answer at four days end unto them, was this which follows:

His Majesty's twenty first Message.
His Majesty's most gracious Answer to the Bills and Propositions presented to
Him at Carisbrook-Castle in the Isle of Wight, December. 24. 1647.
CHARLES R.

THe necessity of complying with all engaged interests in these great
distempers, for a perfect setlement of Peace, His Majesty finds to be none of
the least difficulties He has met with since the time of His afflictions.
Which is too visible, when at the same time, that the two Houses of the English
Parliament do present to his Majesty several Bills and Propositions for His
consent, the Commissioners for Scotland do openly protest against them. So that
were there nothing in the case, but the consideration of that difference, His
Majesty cannot imagine how to give such an Answer to what is now proposed, as
thereby to promise Himself his great end, A perfect Peace. And when His Majesty
farther considers, how impossible it is (in the condition He now stands) to
fulfill the desires of His two Houses; since the only ancient and known ways
of passing Laws, are either by his Majesty's Personal Assent in the House of
Peers, or by Commission under his Great Seal of England: He cannot but wonder
at such failings in the manner of Address, which is now made unto Him. Unless
his two Houses intend, that his Majesty shall allow of a Great Seal made
without his Authority, before there be any consideration had thereupon in a
Treaty. Which as it may hereafter hazard the security it self; so for the
present, it seems very unreasonable to his Majesty. And though his Majesty is
willing to believe, that the intention of very many in both Houses, in sending
these Bills before a Treaty, was only to obtain a trust from Him, and not to
take any advantage by passing them to force other things from Him, which are
either against His Conscience or Honor: Yet his Majesty believes it clear to
all understandings, that these Bills contain (as they are now penned) not only
the devesting Himself of all Sovereignty, and that without possibility of
recovering it, either to Him or his Successors, (except by repeal of those
Bills) but also the making his Concessions guilty of the greatest pressures that
can be made upon the Subject, as in other particulars, so by giving an
Arbitrary and Unlimited power to the two Houses for ever, to raise and levy
Forces, for Land or Sea service, of what persons (without distinction or
quality) and to what numbers they please. And likewise for the payment of them,
to levy what Moneys, in such sort, and by such ways and means (and
consequently upon the Estates of whatsoever Persons) they shall think fit and
appoint. Which is utterly inconsistent with the Liberty and Property of the
Subject, and his Majesty's trust in protecting them. So that if the Major part
of both Houses, shall think it necessary to put the rest of the Propositions
into Bills; His Majesty leaves all the world to judge, how unsafe it would be
for Him to consent thereunto. And if not; what a strange condition (after the
passing of these four Bills) his Majesty and all his Subjects would be cast
into. And here his Majesty thinks it not unfit, to wish his two Houses to
consider well the manner of their proceeding: That when his Majesty desires a
Personal Treaty with them for the settling of a Peace; they in answer, propose
the very subject matter of the most essential part thereof to be first
granted. A thing which will be hardly credible to Posterity. Wherefore his
Majesty declares, That neither the desire of being freed from this tedious and
irksome condition of life his Majesty has so long suffered, nor the
apprehension of what may befall him, in case his two Houses shall not afford him
a Personal Treaty, shall make him change his resolution, of not consenting to
any Act, till the whole Peace be concluded. Yet then, he intends not only to
give just and reasonable satisfaction in the particulars presented to him; but
also to make good all other Concessions mentioned in his Message of the 16. of
November. last. Which he thought would have produced better effects, then what he
finds in the Bills and Propositions now presented unto him.

And yet his Majesty cannot give over, but now again earnestly presses for a
Personal Treaty, (so passionately is he affected with the advantages which
Peace will bring to his Majesty and all his Subjects) of which he will not at
all despair, (there being no other visible way to obtain a wel-grounded Peace.)
However his Majesty is very much at ease within himself, for having fulfilled
the offices both of a Christian and of a King; and will patiently wait the good
pleasure of Almighty God, to incline the hearts of his two Houses to consider
their King, and to compassionate their fellow Subjects miseries.

Given at Carisbrook-Castle in the Isle of Wight, December. 28. 1647. For the
Speaker of the Lords House pro tempore* to be communicated to the Lords and
Commons in the Parliament of England at Westminster, and the Commissioners of
the Parliament of Scotland.

HIs Majesty's Afflictions have been much increased by manifesting His care (as
an equal Father) that satisfaction might be given to all engaged interests,
therefore Presbyterians, Independents, Army, Scots, and all whoever they be,
that acknowledge a part in them, and remain yet unsatisfied, have reason as
Christians, as Subjects, as men for mere gratitude sake, (were there no other
reason) to endeavor the vindication of those wrongs (at least) which His
Majesty has suffered since He stood forth as their Common Advocate. To prevent
their Audience (upon the Kings motion) were these Bills devised, and sent in
this sort unto His Majesty. And for His not consenting so far to their damage,
and to the undoing of all the rest of His Subjects as these Bills required, was
His Majesty cast into a more hard and miserable Condition (by some degrees)
then ever before; having all His Servants on the sudden by violence thrust out
from Him, not so much as one of His Divines allowed unto Him. Himself confined
to two or three Rooms within the walls of a loathed Prison; assaulted
frequently He is with evil language, and tormented with the spightfull
behaviors of the Enemy, permitted to see or speak to none but rude Soldiers,
who are set to watch Him, and whom He has hourly cause to look upon, as
Assassinates appointed for to murder Him: His friends are not suffered to write
unto Him, nor His Children to send the remembrance of their duties, yet His
Trunks and Pockets are often searched for Letters, with the highest insolency
and rudeness that can be shown. And all this (with much more of like nature
then can be expressed) is come upon Him (as it seems) for moving in the
behalf of all engaged interests: and therefore most truly did His Majesty in
the Beginning of this Message say (for He has felt it since) that He found the
complying with all engaged interests in these great distempers, none of the
least difficulties He met withal since the time of His Afflictions: and
therefore also (as was said before) were there no other cause, they are all
bound to engage for Him, till they have set Him free from His present Thraldom.

And (indeed) the Scotch Commissioners (for their parts) began well, in their
protesting (in the name of their whole Kingdom) against those unreasonable
Bills, at the same time, that they were by the English Commissioners presented
to His Majesty as being prejudicial to Religion, to the Crown, to the union,
and interest of both Nations, and directly different from their former mutual
proceedings and engagements: now His Majesty for taking notice of this (which
was uttered in His presence and in the name of a whole Kingdom) is extremely
quarrelled at: and because He did not sign the said Bills (notwithstanding the
said protest) He is immediately made close Prisoner, and sensible of more then
barbarous usage: the Method of which is in part expressed, in the following
Declaration, which twenty days after His close confinement was written by His
Majesty's own hand, and some twenty days aft^r that, by the special order and
providence of him who is the preserver of Princes brought to light, and
published to our view: if any of His people can read or hear the same without
melting hearts and yearning bowels toward their King, and inflamed spirits
against these tormenters of Him, assuredly they may be suspected to have
nothing of Christ, or goodness in them.

The Kings Declaration from Carisbrook-Castle, Jan. 18. 1647.
To all my people of whatsoever Nation, Quality or Condition.
AM I thus laid aside, and must I not speak for my self? No! I will speak, and
that to all my People, (which I would have rather done, by the way of my two
Houses of Parliament, but that there is a public Order, neither to make
addresses to, or receive Message from me) and who but you can be judge of the
differences betwixt Me, and my two Houses? I know none else; for I am sure, you
it is, who will enjoy the happiness, or feel the misery, of good, or ill
Government; And we all pretend who should run fastest to serve you; without
having a regard (at least in the first place) to particular Interests: And
therefore I desire you to consider the state I am, and have bin, in, this long
time, and whether my Actions have more tended to the Public, or my own
particular good; for whosoever will look upon me, barely, as I am Man, without
that liberty (which the meanest of my Subjects enjoyes) of going whither, and
conversing with whom I will: As a Husband and Father, without the comfort of my
Wife and Children; or lastly, as a King, without the least show of Authority or
Power, to protect my distressed Subjects; Must conclude me, not only void of
all Natural Affection, but also to want common understanding; if I should not
most cheerfully embrace the readiest way, to the settlement of these distracted
Kingdoms: As also on the other side, do but consider the form and draught of
the Bills lately presented unto me, and as they are the conditions of a Treaty,
ye will conclude, that the same spirit which has still been able to frustrate
all my sincere and constant endeavors for Peace, has had a powerful
influence on this Message; for though I was ready to grant the substance, and
comply with what they seem to desire; yet as they had framed it, I could not
agree thereunto, without deeply wounding my Conscience and Honor, and
betraying the trust reposed in me, by abandoning my People to the Arbitrary and
Unlimited Power of the two Houses for ever, for the leavying and maintaining of
Land or Sea Forces, without distinction of quality, or limitation for Money
taxes: And if I could have passed them in terms; how unheard of a condition
were it for a Treaty, to grant beforehand the most considerable part of the
subject matter? How ineffectuall were that debate like to prove, wherein the
most potent Party had nothing of moment left to ask; and the other nothing
more to give? So consequently, how hopeless of mutual compliance? Without
which, a settlement is impossible: Besides, if after my concessions, the two
Houses should insist on those things, from which I cannot depart; how desperate
would the condition of these Kingdoms be, when the most proper and approved
remedy should become ineffectuall? Being therefore fully resolved that I could
neither in Conscience, Honor, or Prud^nce, pass those four B^ls; I only
endeavored to make the Reasons and Justice of my Denial appear to all the
world, as they do to Me, intending to give as little dis-satisfaction to the
two Houses of Parliament, (without betraying my own Cause) as the matter would
bear: I was desirous to give my Answer, of the 28. of December last, to the
Commissioners Sealed, (as I had done others heretofore, and sometimes at the
desire of the Commissioners) chiefly, because when my Messages or Answers were
publicly known, before they were read in the Houses; prejudicial
interpretations were forced on them, much differing, and sometimes contrary to
my meaning: For example, my Answer from Hampton Court, was accused of dividing
the two Nations, because I promised to give sat^sfaction to the Scots, in all
things concerning that Kingdom: And this last suffers in a contrary sense, by
making me intend to interest Scotland in the Laws of this Kingdom, (then
which nothing was, nor is, further from my thoughts) because I took notice of
the Scots Commissioners protesting against the Bills and Propositions, as
contrary to the interests and engagements of the two Kingdoms: Indeed, if I
had not mentioned their dissent; an Objection, not without some probability,
might have been made against me, both in respect the Scots are much concerned
in the Bill for the Militia, and in several other Propositions; and my silence
might, with some Justice, have seemed to approve of it: But the Commissioners
refusing to receive my Answer Sealed, I (upon the engagement of their, and the
Governors Honor, that no other use should be made, or notice taken of it, then
as if it had not been seen) read and delivered it open unto them; Whereupon,
what has since passed, either by the Governor, in discharging most of my
Servants, redoubling the Guards, and restraining me of my former liberty, (and
all this, as himself confessed, merely out of his own dislike of my Answer,
notwithstanding his before said Engagement) or afterward, by the two Houses,
(as the Governor affirms) in confining me within the circuit of this Castle,
I appeal to God and the World, whether my said Answer deserved the reply of
such proceedings: besides the unlawfulness for Subjects to imprison their
King: That, by the permission of Almighty God, I am reduced to this sad
condition, as I no way repine, so I am not without hope, but that the same God,
will, in due time, convert these Afflictions into my advantage: in the mean
time, I am confident to bear these crosses with patience, and a great equality
of Mind: but by what means or occasion I am come to this Relapse in my
Affairs, I am utterly to seek, especially when I consider, that I have
sacrificed, to my two Houses of Parliament, for the Peace of the Kingdom, all,
but, what is much more dear to me then my Life, My Conscience and Honor;
desiring nothing more, then to perform it, in the most proper and natural
way, A Personal Treaty. But that which makes me most at a loss, is, the
remembering my signal compliance with the Army, and their interests; and of
what importance my Compliance was to them; and their often repeated Professions
and Engagements, for my just Rights, in general, at Newmarket and S. Albans;
and their particular explanation of those generals, by their Voted and Re-voted
Proposals; which I had reason to understand should be the utmost extremity
would be expected from me, and that, in some things therein, I should be eased;
(herein appealing to the Consciences of some of the chiefest Officers in the
Army, if what I have said, be not punctually true) and how I have failed of
their expectations, or my professions to them; I challenge them and the whole
World to produce the least color of Reason. And now I would know, what it is
that is desired: Is it Peace? I have showed the way (being both willing, and
desirous to perform my part in it) which is, a just compliance with all chief
interests: Is it Plenty and Happiness? they are the inseparable effects of
Peace: Is it Security? I, who wish that all men would forgive and forget like
Me, have offered the Militia for my time: Is it Liberty of Conscience? He who
wants it, is most ready to give it: Is it the right administration of Justice?
Officers of trust are committed to the choice of my two Houses of Parliament:
Is it frequent Parliaments? I have legally, fully concurred therewith: Is it
the Arrears of the Army? upon a settlement, they will certainly be paid with
much ease; but before, there will be found much difficulty, if not
impossibility in it.

Thus all the world cannot but see my real and unwearied endeavors for Peace,
the which (by the grace of God) I shall neither repent me of, nor ever be
slackned in, notwithstanding my past, present, or future, sufferings; but, if I
may not be heard, let every one judge, who it is that obstructs the good I
would, or might do: What is it that men are afraid to hear from me? It cannot
be Reason, (at least, none will declare themselves so unreasonable, as to
confess it) and it can less be, impertinent or unreasonable Discourses; for
thereby, peradventure I might more justify this my Restraint, then the causers
themselves can do; so that, of all wonders yet this is the greatest to me: but,
it may be easily gathered, how those men intend to govern, who have used me
thus: And if it be my hard Fate to fall together with the liberty of this
Kingdom, I shall not blush for my self, but much lament the future miseries
of my People; the which, I shall still pray to God to avert; what ever becomes
of me.

CHARLES R.

BEhold here all Englishmen, and you of Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, in whose
manly Breasts does yet remain any true sparks of right Religion, or Ancient
Honor: Behold your King, the breath of your Nostrils, the Anointed of the
Lord, under whose shadow you dwelt in peace, enjoying wealth many years
together, whose yoke was easy and sweet unto you, Behold, behold, He is taken,
and snared in a pit, see how sadly He sits in darkness and has no light;
hearken how He complains unto you, out of Prison, that He is laid aside, or,
become like a broken vessel: forgotten (as it were) like a dead man out of
mind: shall it be as nothing to you (All you to whom this Appeal is made, this
Declaration sent;) that your Protector, your Defender, the Glory of Christians,
and Mirror of Kings is thus used? Have you no feeling of His sufferings? no
share in His sorrows? is it not for your sakes, that He indures all these hard
and heavy things? can there be named any other reason for them, then because He
will not yield you up to be slaves and bondmen? is He not divested of all His
power, stripped of His whole Authority, deprived of all His Comforts, barred from
the sight of Wife and Children, denied Liberty of going whither, and conversing
with whom He desires; because He will not consent that you without rule or
reason, should be handled and used in this manner? He will not wound His
Conscience and Honor in betraying the trust reposed in Him by Almighty God
over you; He will not deliver you up into those hands, which have already so
much abused you; He will not abandon you to the unlimited power of the two
Houses for ever: He will not grant them His l^ave, to levy Land and Sea sorces
from among you by violence, and to maintain them continually upon you, at your
cost and Charges, and against you, to keep you under, without either Law or
Limitation: in a word, He will not consent that you should be kept in
perpetual Beggary, and made Vassals to your equals and fellows; and for this
cause are all these miseries heaped on Him.

Read over again, and view well, His many Gracious Messages, and offers
together with their unreasonable demands and Propositions; and remember
withal, how uncomfortably, how chargeably, nay how miserably every way, you
have lived, sin^e these men (who would always rule) have exercised power over
you. Oh how is your Gold become dim, since your King has bin in darkness? How
is your sine Gold changed, since He has been excluded? the precious stones of
the Sanctuary, how have they been defiled, made as Common, and poured out in
every street, since He the most precious of all, has been refused by these new
Mushrom Master Builders? the most Honorable Sons of Sion, the Children of your
Princes, comparable to fine Gold, how are they esteemed in these days as
earthen pitchers? how have your most Heroic Nobles been vilified and debased;
your most Gallant Gentry been trod and trampled under? Your freeborn
Yeomanry, the sinews of the Kingdom, how have they been tyrannized over in
their own houses, and how many of all sorts have been beggered, butchered, and
destroyed, since these unhappy men (who would for ever sit aloft) have
domineered? How has the most reverend and learned Clergy, the servants of the
most high God, been despised, persecuted, and defamed? How is that rich and
renowned City, London, become as a Widow, in the absence of her Husband, by the
means and operation of these new usurpers? How has her most eminent
Magistrates, her Majors, and Aldermen been imprisoned? Her wealthy Merchants
impoverished, her Commons of all sorts been baffled, and deluded? How has the
luster of her excellent order, and flourishing government been darkened and
obscured? She was so great among the Nations, (while her Sovereigns influence
shined upon her) that for her Beauty, Freedom, and Splendor above the rest,
she was reckoned a Princess among all the European Provinces, being as rich in
Treasures, as she was in People: But now, alas! how is she become a Captive,
and a Tributary to her own servants? She now weepeth sore, (at least she has
cause so to do, and that as well in regard of her deception, and her sin, as
of her misery) for that among all her lovers, (whom she so foolishly, and so
wickedly doted on) she has none to comfort her: for all those her friends whom
she trusted in, have dealt treacherously with her, and are become her enemies,
yea her most vexatious Tormenters: And because our most Christian King is not
willing to sign a Bill of perpetuity, for the continuation of these sad
Calamities upon her, upon you, and upon us all for ever, therefore is He
tortured in that manner as we see and hear: therefore is His Princely Honor
blasted, His Royal good name defamed, His Regal power, Authority, and
Revenues taken away and kept from Him; His pious Conscience assaulted, His
sacred person imprisoned, and every day in danger to be massacred, and
murdered. O may it not well be asked and said, Was there ever sorrow, like unto
his sorrow, for such a cause? Were there ever wrongs like unto these that are
done unto our King, because He will not consent to the utter undoing of us his
people? Assuredly, never was people more wretched, and accursed then we shall
be, (and that meritoriously) both of God and Men, if we suffer this, and do
not stand up and appear for His deliverance.

For what are these men that thus tyrannize over our Sovereign, and over us?
are they not his vassals, and our fellows, nay our serv^nts entrusted by us to
manifest and present the tenders of our duty and reverence unto him; and does
it not concern us therefore, to bring them to correction, (as the case now
stands with the King) for these their gross enormities; will not their
impieties, and exorbitancies else be laid to our charge? Nay, do they not in
their impudency act all their wickednesses in our names? would they not have
their late defamatory Libell to be understood as the expression of our senses?
Do they not call it The Declaration of the Commons, (scil. of England, as if
we (at least) gave allowance to it, or set them a work to make it? When, as God
and our consciences do bear us witness, we loathe it with our very souls,
as the most horrid heap of the most shameless lies, blasphemies and slanders,
that ever was spued up against Majesty and Innocence by men or devils, since
the first Creation. Nay, have they not since their publication of it, tempted
and provoked many of the ignorant of us, in diverse Countries, to set our Hands
to Papers coined by themselves, of Gratulations to themselves, for venting the
same, and for making those their wicked Votes against our Sovereign, the Lords
Anointed? Do they not hereby plainly endeavor (Satan-like) to involve our
souls in their own guilt, and to plunge them for ever in the same pit of
damnation with themselves? As if it were not enough that they have already
wasted us all, in our estates; and wounded the consciences of too many of us,
by engaging us (through their false pretenses of Religion, Liberty, and
Previlege of Parliament) to associate with them in this unnatural War, unless
they do this also: And have they not menaced others of us, because we refused
to approve of this their late most abominable wickedness, and went about
rather to move for His Majesty's Liberty and restoration? Have they not
threatened to plunder and sequester us of all we have yet remaining, if we
proceeded to make any motions or requests to that purpose! as if they had a
spite and malice at Almighty God himself, for opening our eyes at length, and
bringing us out of that darkness, wherein they had shut us, and hoped always
to keep us: and for his touching our hearts with remorse and sorrow for our
former compliance with them, as if also we must never dare to speak more, but
only such words as they shall suggest, and put into our mouths; nor to set
our hands unto any thing but what they (forsooth) shall frame and dictate to
us; And is this the Freedom of the Subject so much cried up? Is this the
Liberty which the people of England have so fought for? Is this our so
flourishing state of happiness which was promised by our blessed Reformers?
Sero sapiunt phryges, fools may grow wise at length, and so from henceforth
shall we, for ever following them any farther, or being guided by them any
more, who by their glorious professions and protestations have seduced us
already so far from the ways of God.

We cannot but call to mind, the proceedings of this Palliament, (or of this
Thing which so calls it self, being in very deed, but a corrupt faction in
it:) How at first they framed a Protestation General, for the matter of it
good, (we still confess and acknowledge) but the deep subtilty and intrige of
it, was not then apparent to us: But now we consider how they did (without the
Kings sanction and ratification) little less then impose it upon the whole
Kingdom, whereby they slily crept into a kind of unexampled authority, no way
belonging to them; which they cunningly masked, under the specious pretenses of
pious respects to the Protestant Religion, Loyal regards to His Majesty's
Person and Dignity, and of their serious care of the Privileges of Parliament,
Properties and Liberties of the Subject: no one of which (as we now see by
their actions) was ever in their thoughts to preserve, for their whole
endeavors have since been, and still are, to destroy and suppress all these:
but hereby at first they caught us in their net, and carried us down the
stream with them.

And having thus surprised us, Jealousies and Fears presently began to surprise
them; which also the whole Kingdom must be sensible of, as if all the things
to be defended by the Protestation were in some eminent danger of sudden
destruction: to prevent which a Petition is framed in all haste by themselves,
and sent down into all Countries to be subscribed there, and sent back as the
unanimous desire of the whole Kingdom, that Bishops and Popish Lords, (who
must be apprehended the conjoynt and deadly enemies to all good things
contained in the Protestation) might be put out of Parliament; that the
Kingdom might be put into a posture of defense (or war) against them and their
Accomplices; and the better to color and credit the business, we must desire in
the same Petition to have a monthly fast Authorized. And we well remember,
there was care taken at that very time; (lest this mystery of Iniquity that was
in working should be discovered to us:) that the Learned Seers, or watchmen of
God (who were most likely to to make it known,) should be exposed to scorn and
contempt, under the name of Prelaticall, Scandalous, and Malignant Clergy;
that so their Testimonies might be of no esteem with us; and a generation of
men full of ignorance, covetousness or discontents, were countenanced and
advanced over us, as fitly isntrumental and subservient to the design on
foot, which (now we find) was only to ruin our King, and us.

The Consequents of this Petition appeared soon after to be these. 1. An
alteration or change of military Officers, the Train-Bands being committed into
the hands only of such as were called Confiding men. 2. The appointment of a
Guard to defend our worthies of Parliament, (as they were entitled.) And 3. An
exposall of the Kings Person and Government to all possible danger and
disgrace: And that 1. By a most scandalous Remonstrance, wherein the sins of
themselves and others (who had been His ill Officers) were all laid to His
Charge. 2. By setting the Tumultuous People upon Him, to drive Him from
Westminster. And then 3. By raising an Army to fetch Him back again, as was
pretended, though in very deed we find now, it was to destroy Him rather.

We remember how they told us then, that the King was amongst them in His
politic Capacity; whereby they had full power to act, even as if He had been
personally there; but if He were suffered to be absent, He would doubtless in
His natural Capacity be very mischievous to the Kingdom; having such ill
Councillors about Him, (as they said He had) and such damned Cavaliers, who
(as their preachers taught us to believe for good Doctrine) were as bad as
devils; and whose very shape; and faces the Lord (in his judgment) had
already so altered, that they did not now look like men, as formerly, but like
strange horrid monsters: So that God having set a visible mark of His vengeance
upon them, as He did on Cain; our duty was, and we were bound in Conscience to
pursue them as Reprobates, and as men cursed of God, unless our selves would
run the hazard of that bitter Curse which was laid upon the Inhabitants of
Meroz, because they did not help the Lord against the Mighty. After this manner
they seduced us, and led us, (too many of us) to think ill of the King, and of
those that were Conscientious and faithful unto Him.

Having thus consorted themselves with His Majesty in the Empire, by their
incroaching on His Authority; and thus gulled us by this device of His Politic
and natural Capacity; (as if being armed or Authorized by the one, we might
destroy him in the other:) Which distinction, we now understand (since the
return of Reason to us) to be but a mere vaporous Fancy, a gross Bull, a very
absurd Juggle, invented by state Empericks to cheat silly people into disorder
and disobedience.

And we are confident, if we shall now go about to pay them the interest of
this their distinction, and make it good upon themselves, (as indeed we ought
to endeavor for in such a case only, it may go for current) themselves would
be directly of our opinion: Should we but tell them, that we consider of them
two ways, in a Politic, and in a Natural capacity: As they are in the first,
we honor and worship them; we love them, and regard them, as they are members
of the Body Politic Representative; but (by their favors) in their natural
Capacity, as they are men, we intend to order and handle them as Rebels,
Traitors, parricides, fratricides, thieves, and murderers use to be dealt
withal, even according to Law and Justice, and the due desert of their own
merits: let them ask their own hearts whether in such a case, and at such a
time they will readily approve of it.

But hereby (as we were saying) they began to raise Forces in the name of King
and Parliament; and under that style (or rather Contradiction) Commissions are
issued, Soldiers are levied, and Taxes of diverse sorts and unheard of names
imposed upon us the Kings Subjects; to fight against and oppress our King, (as
we now perceive) and to take His Regal power directly from Him: for they are
not ashamed now to publish (in plain English) before all the world, that this
War was undertaken to wrest the Militia and Legislative power from the King
and His Posterity: In the 64. page of their late Declaration against the Scots,
(or concerning the Papers of the Scots Commissioners:) their words to this
purpose are these, The Kingdom of Scotland (say they) engaged wi^h us, in this
war, upon these Principles, viz. for to have the Legislative power, and the
exercise of the Militia, without, and against the Kings consent.

If the Kingdom of Scotland did engage with them, on these terms, and for
these ends (as they now tell us) yet we are confident that the people of
England, were better instructed then to do so, for they had not so learned
Christ, who commands to give unto Caesar, the things that are Caesar's, and not
to take them away from Him. We were here told of no other causes of the war,
then to maintain Protestant Religion, established in this Church, to defend the
Kings Person, Honor, and Estate, and to free Him from ill Counselors, and to
preserve the Privileges of Parliament, the Laws of the Land, and Liberties of
the Subject, and to bring Delinquents to punishment, all which we were assured
(and that from the Pulpit too) as well as from the Parliament and the Press,
were lawful causes for a War; though now we see how we were abused in that
also, for Christian verity gives warrant to none of them, unless withal, we
have the call and allowance of the Supreme Authority. Yea and besides, how many
times did these Declarers protest before all the world, that it was not in
their thoughts, to loosen the reins of Government, or to diminish any of the
Kings rights: no, we profess (said they) in the sight of Almighty God, which
is the strongest obligation of a Christian, etc. that no ill Affection to His
Majesty's Person, no design to the prejudice of His just Honor and Authority,
engaged us to raise Forces, and to take up Arms. And again, We profess from
our very hearts and souls, our Loyalty and Obedience to His Crown, our
readiness and resolution to defend His Person, and support His estate with our
lives and fortunes to the uttermost of our powers: And again oftentimes, God
deal so by them, as they intended to make Him terrible to His Enemies abroad,
and glorious among His friends at home, etc. And yet now they tell the world
(after all this) that they engaged at the very first in this War to have the
Legislative power, and the exercise of the Militia, without and against the
Kings consent: and they say the Scots engaged with them herein; which we scarce
believe, for we know the Scots are too politic and wise a Nation, then not to
foresee their own damage, if the Legislative power, and the Militia of this
Kingdom, should be wrested out of the hands of the King, their Countryman and
Sovereign; and put solely into the hands of those, who have no such relations
or Affections to them. And (beside) the Scots Commissioners had said, (as these
their opposers do allege in the same page) that they were obliged by their
Covenant, Allegiance, and Duty of Subjects, not to diminish, but to support the
Kings just Power and Greatness: and therefore, we have reason to believe, they
did not intend the Contrary at the beginning, and the rather, because these men
say they did, whom we never yet found true in any thing.

Indeed, in Answer to that of the Scots Commissioners, they affirm (though
without proof or reason) that the King Contrary to His Oath, had diminished the
just Privileges of Parliament, and Liberties of the Subjects; and how (say
they) can He that breaks down the hedge, complain of incroachment upon His
several? so that the Kings pretended incroachment on them, is now become a
warrant for them to incroach really upon Him; and to take away all His Kingly
power from Him, only because (by their own sole testimony) He had made a
diminution of somewhat that belonged to them. This is good Parliament Divinity,
as the world goes in these days, fetched sure out of the Turks Alchoran, or
else from among the Savage Heathens in New England; for no Protestant, no true
Christian, nor no Parliament before this, did ever allow or connive at it, much
less urge or allege it, to warrant themselves in the practice of it.

But we cannot pass by, without observation, how they prove their
forementioned Charge against the Scots in the same page, Some of these very
Commissioners (say they) were amongst the forwardest, to engage the Kingdoms in
a joint War upon the Principles forenamed (viz. to exercise the Legislative
power, and Militia without and against the Kings consent) also in Oaths and
Covenants to be imposed on both Kingdoms, in Taxes to raise Money upon them,
taking away the Book of Common Prayer and establishing the Directory instead
thereof, and in diverse other things, wherein the highest exercise of the
Legislative power does consist. These be their Arguments, whereby they speak
themselves to be as bad Logitians, as they are Christians. Their doings since
they began, are alleged as Reasons to prove why they began: and their unjust
Actions in their progress, are made the grounds and warrants of and for their
ungodly undertaking.

But did any of those Oaths and Covenants, (which were imposed on both or
either of the Kingdoms) mention the cause of the war or of peoples engagement
to be, for to take the Legislative power and the Militia totally from the King,
and to have it exercised without and against His consent? if any such matters
had been expressed, we are very confident, they would have had but few either
English or Scots, joining in Covenant with them, or lending their Assistance.

But in page 66. of the same Declaration, they would fain suggest, that though
there be no Reason, yet there is some likelihood of Reasonableness, in this
their injustice, and wrongful dealings, in taking the Legislative Power and
Militia from the King: for they argue thus:

It is much more likely (say they) that a King should be mistaken, then the
Great Council of the Kingdom, and that a King should stop that which is for
the good of the whole Kingdom, then that the whole Kingdom represented in
Parliament should desire what should be for their own hurt: And it is much more
likely, that a King should make use of one of His Kingdoms to oppress another,
that He might make Himself absolute over all (if He has the Militia and Power
in His hand,) then that He should (with the same) hinder one Kingdom to wrong
another, or all the Subjects of a Kingdom to wrong themselves.

We do very well remember, that many of us (the Common people of England) were
befooled with these their likelyhoods at the beginning, for they used these
very expressions then unto us: but we can now answer them from our own
experience, better then we could at that time do: and we say, it is much more
certain that a King has been, is, and will be, much more tender of the blood
of His Subjects, much more indulgent of the wealth of His people, much more
careful to maintain and preserve them in their Rights, and to keep them from
oppressing one another, then those are, or have been who now call themselves
the Great Council of the Kingdom. We are sure, there are more of a Parents
bowels in Him, (for we have felt them) then there is of Brotherly affection in
them, toward us, (which we have had some feeling of too, though to our grief
and sorrow.) And therefore we can and must conclude, that the Subjects are far
more happy every way, and free from being oppressed by one another, under the
fatherly Government of a King, then under the tyranous usurpation of
fellow subjects: for we now remember that God has promised in express words,
to guide the King so, that his lips shall not transgress in Judgment: but we
find no such promise made to a Parliament, that resolves to act without, and
against their Kings consent: we know that Scripture says, the Kings heart is
in Gods hand, and from thence we now believe it was, that His Government was so
just and gentle; but the Actions and behaviors of these men has fully
persuaded us, that their Hearts be in the Devils hand whereby it has come to
pass, that their purposes and their practices have been so bloody, so
mischievous, and so destructive.

And yet these men supposing (as it seems) that we are all as bruit Beasts, in
respect of themselves (having no understanding at all, but must submit still to
be held in, with their Bits and Bridles,) do declare, that the Militia is the
foundation of security to them and to their posterity; as if we were all bound
to believe, and had reason for it, that their blessed selves, and their
precious posterity, were rather to be secured and preserved thereby, then the
King and His: and in page 70. they argue as Rabsaketh did, from their success,
that God favored their unrighteous doings, and was even such another as
themselves, directly of their opinion; the dispute (say they) concerning the
Militia, has been long, and sadly debated both in black and red letters, but
God himself has now given the verdict on our side.

And in the very same place they tell all us Englishmen (as if the Militia had
never yet been in His Majesty's hand, or we had quite forgotten our freedom,
happiness and prosperity under Kingly Government) that our Magna Charta, our
Courts of Justice, our High Court of Parliament it self, our Lives, Liberties
and Estates; that we are not all at the will of one man; that the King cannot
make Laws, nor raise Moneys without consent of Parliament; and that all
Offenders may be punished in Courts of Justice; all this (say they) signifies
nothing at all to us, if the Militia by Sea and Land be in the King alone, we
are all absolute slaves, and by so much in a worse Condition because we think
our selves at Liberty. All this of theirs does but show us, what opinion they
have of us, for our giving so much credit to them heretofore; But truly we
shall deserve to be their absolute slaves for ever, (as they would have us) and
to be branded to all posterity for absolute fools too, and for the rankest
Cowards that ever were, if this their Language (were there nothing else) should
not fill us up, with high disdain against them, and make us resolve never to
desist, till we have made them know both themselves and us better.

And to awaken our spirits more yet, let us hear what they say further in the
same place to our conceived simplicities. How ridiculous (say they) are those
Laws which may be violated by force, and by force not be defended: (who has
violated our Laws by force but themselves? and who has been the defender of
them but the King whose Laws they are?) And what a mock Authority (say they) is
that of Courts of Justice, and of the High Court of Parliament it self, if it
be not accompanied with the power of the sword, when by the power of the sword
it shall be opposed, affronted resisted, their summons scorned, their
Messengers kicked about the streets, their Votes and Judgments derided. A
mock-Authority indeed that is, and a mock-Parliament too that disclaims Him,
from whom it self derives its being, and to whom God and the Law has committed
the power of the Sword.

We have had heretofore many Parliaments, but never read or heard of any, while
they kept their integrity, and adhered to their maker, that convened them
together, who were ever opposed, affronted, resisted, or had any of their
summons scorned, their Messengers kicked about the streets, or their Votes and
Judgments derided: therefore all this is but copia verborum, some flowers of
Rebellious Rhetoric, whereby they think to keep silly fools, (such as they
take us still to be) in that vile Captivity unto themselves, wherein they
formerly had, and led us.

Yea and page 73. of that their so bonny Declaration, they tell us to the
everlasting comfort both of us, and of our purses; that it is necessary that
their Armies be kept still on foot, even so long as themselves, and their
posterities shall fit, which they make account shall be but in perpetuum, from
Generation to Generation till the worlds end: their words are these, for the
Parliaments consulting freely, and acting securely it will be necessary (as we
have ever done since the war) to keep up forces; which were they all disbanded
(as the Scotch Commissioners desire) we should not long consult freely and act
securely: They mean sure in cutting our throats, in banishing, imprisoning, and
hanging our persons, in sequestring our estates, in oppressing, plundering, and
taking from us our goods and fortunes, in destroying our Religion, peace, and
order, for nothing else do we know they have consulted about, or acted since
they first raised their Forces, or begun their war; we have had Parliaments
before now, that have behaved themselves a great deal better, then these
Declarers have done; that have consulted better, and acted better every way;
and yet never thought it necessary, either to raise or keep up Forces for their
own guard or safety: No, for they were fenced with Innocence, and Nobleness
of Spirit; with their own uprightness and their Countries Love, which
together with the Guard of God, and his Angels, was their Protection; they
desired no other Militia then Faith and a good Conscience to secure them. For
why, they had never bathed themselves in their Countries blood, nor foul'd
their hands with oppression, nor any way deserved the odium of their Nation.
But these men show what they have merited by their fears; and discover, that as
they raised Forces at first, to subdue the King, so they intend now to keep
them up to subdue the Kingdom, and to keep those in low slavery, whose help
they have had against Him: and so they will pay their servants, (for as such
only they account those whom they have employed or made use of) a la mode du
diable, in that manner as Satan rewards those that work for him.

And now the world sees at last, who began the war at first, and hears from
them who know best, what was the true cause thereof; even to wrest the
Legislative power, and the Militia out of the Kings hands, and to exercise the
same without and against His consent. How true their former clamours have been,
that the King first took up Arms against the Parliament; and that the
Parliament was only on the defensive part, let the very seduced part of men now
judge. His sacred Majesty in his great wisdom saw this to be their end at
first, and told the world of it, but could not be heard or believed, so loud a
noise was made to the contrary: themselves (in the 68. page of that their
Declaration) tell the Scotch Commissioners (who had said, it was contrary to
their judgments and Oath of Allegiance to divest the Crown, the King and His
Posterity of the right and power of the Militia) that they fortify their
opinion with the very same Arguments, and almost in the very same words, as the
King did at the beginning of this war, in His Declarations, whereby they
acknowleged, that His Majesty even then, had spoken to that purpose. It is
hoped therefore, that all men do now apprehend, who they are that (all this
while) have been the Deceivers.

Again, the world also has now seen, how far and wherein His Majesty has
been averse to peace, since the beginning of the war: He would not hitherto be
either forced or persuaded to resign up wholly and for ever unto them, that
which from the very first they resolved to have from Him; the Legislative
power, and the Militia of the Kingdom to be exercised without and against
Himself, to the perpetual enslavement and thraldom of all us His poor
Subjects; whom God has committed to his trust to protect and defend; And
therefore (if it were lawful for Subjects upon any occasion to imprison their
King) yet what great cause or substantial reason these have had to do so, or
to use their Sovereign as they have done, to resolve to make no more
addresses, or applications to Him, let the world judge.

And from these many gracious Messages of His Majesty for peace, thus slighted,
contemned* and despised by them, let their little modesty and candor, or
rather their great shamelessness and impudency be observed in their making the
foundation of their impious Votes, to be His averseness unto peace, and in
beginning their Declaration against Him in that manner as they have done: viz.
in these words:

How fruitless our former Addresses have been to the King, is so well known to
the world that it may be expected we shall now declare, why we made the last,
or so many before, rather then why we are resolved to make no more.

We cannot acknowledge any great confidence, that our words could have been
more persuasive with Him, then Sighs and groans; the Tears and crying Blood
(an heavy cry) the Blood of Fathers, Brothers, and Children at onse, the Blood
of many hundred thousand Freeborn Subjects in Three great Kingdoms, which
cruelty it self could not but pity to destroy.

We must not be so unthankefull to God as to forget we were never forced to any
Treaty; and yet we have no less then seven times made such Applications to the
King, and tendered such Propositions, that might occasion the world to judge, we
have not only yielded up our wills and Affections, but our Reason also and
judgment, for obtaining any true Peace or Accommodation. But it never yet
pleased the King to accept of any Tender fit for us to make, nor yet to offer
any fit for us to receive.

Be judges in this case, (O all ye people of the World) now you have read and
seen what offers and tenders the King has made, what reason these men had thus
to 'peale Him? think you not they are men of credit, worthy to be trusted
another time, fit to be believed in all they say further in the sequel of
their Declaration, since their modesty and truth is such in the first page of
it? Assuredly you cannot that conclude, but this of theirs is the most
groundless, shameless, malicious, and impudent slander, that ever was
printed, (by such an Authority as is pretended) against such a Person: And a
Lie (pardon that Scotch word) so gross, and so thick that like the darkness
of Egypt, it may be felt.

O consider well of it, (you the Subjects of this Kingdom) and rouse up your
selves at length, in the behalf of your Sovereign and of your selves: remember
the Honor and dignity of your forefathers, the wisdom and valor that made
them so famous and so feared: O where, where is the Ancient Gallantry of this
Noble Nation? where is that life and courage, that was wont to kindle and flame
in Englishmen, when they saw themselves esteemed simple; and contemned as base
and vile? what is it all dead and buried in snow and cold Ashes? shall it be
thought that no sparks of it are yet remaining in your natures? will you suffer
servants always to rule over you; to inslave and inthrall both you and your
King? awake for shame (or else for ever worthy to be despised) and look about
you, bethink (at length) what you have to do.

Was ever Nation so gulled as you have been? so orereach'd by Cheaters? did
ever any who carried in their breasts the spirits of men, delight to be so
abused by their fellows? to be made fools, used like Asses, and so accounted?
and will you affect it? shall they, who triumph over you, think you always
Children without understanding? surely had they not believed you, as full of
weakness still, as themselves are of wickedness, they would not with that
boldness, have imagined to flam you off, with so base a Narrative against your
Sovereign; as if thereby they had given a satisfactory reason to your
simplicities, for all those wrongs which they have done Him.

And what do they aim at hereby, but to make Him most odious and contemptible,
who of all men living deserves the greatest Reverence, Love and Honor? and why
do they this? but to the end, that they might have some color to destroy Him.

And will you Crucify your King? (says Pilate to the people of the Jews) as
if he had said, what an unheard of vilany will that be? How does the Curse
cleave to that Nation for that act unto this very day? so may it not be said to
you (O people of England) will you murder your King? will you suffer your most
pious and gracious King, after all these unspeakable abuses, which He has
already endured (for your sakes) at the hands of your Servants, (or
Representatives as they call themselves) to be destroyed by them? if you play
the Jews, you shall be paid like Jews, you and your Posterity shall groan
under the Curse of God and man for ever: qui non vetat peccare cum potest,
jubet; not to prevent a mischief when you may, is directly to command it to be
done.

As Absalom by going in to his Fathers Concubines, on the housetop, declared
in the sight of all Israel, that He meant the breach should be irreconcielable,
betwixt his Father and him: so have these men, by this their Declaration spoken
loudly to all the world, that their intentions are, that the difference shall
never be made up, betwixt their Sovereign and themselves: but (indeed) herein
we may observe, that their impudence does far exceed Absoloms: for while he was
on the housetop, committing his wickedness, he did not accuse the King his
Father of the same sin, or lay heavily to his charge that very evil which
himself was then in acting; as these men have done; for they in their
Declaration, do burden their Sovereign with their own faults; they tax Him of
those very things which themselves have committed; and that not only heretofore
(when they were His ill Officers and Servants) but even now are acting at this
very instant time before our faces, and upon our selves while they are
exclaiming upon His Majesty.

And when should the King make Himself liable to all this blame and odium which
they cast upon Him, was it since they promised to make Him so glorious?
Themselves do not affirm this, but as they pretend a great while before: how
comes it then to pass that in their present judgments, He who was formerly
deemed fit to be made the most glorious Prince in Christendom, and promised so
to be, (if He would but comply with them in those things that should be for His
own Honor and the Kingdoms good) is now in their present judgments (being
still the same) become worthy of so much hatred as is here manifested, and not
fit to have any more Addresses made unto Him? bad are the memories of these
men, the change of their condition has made them quite forget their former
principles and professions: what credit (think you) can be given henceforth
unto them? what confidence can be put in any of their promises? is it not
likely they will fail you, (who ere you be that trust them) as they have done
their Sovereign? nay, have they not failed you enough already? do you look
they will ever repay that Money (with eight in the hundred interest) which they
took up of you in Public Faiths name? what special respect do you observe,
the City London, and the adjoining Associate Counties do now find from them for
all that wealth, countenance, and assistance which has been afforded to them?
do not they (like their own father Satan) exact most still from those, whom
they have found most compliable, and most yiedling?

Nay more then this, do they not now discover a manifest adherence to the
schismatic Army, (which they entitle the faithful Army) against the City,
the Associate Counties, the whole Kingdom, and Scotland too, as well as
against the King? have not some of the unsavory Aldermen, Members of the
Commons House, gone senting up and down of late, and soliciting men to engage
themselves, to live and die with the Parliament, and the Army? and against
whom? but King and Kingdom, who it seems are now looked upon, as one again,
and conjoined (though it be in the notion of Common Enemies) by these good
Counselors, these faithful Representatives, that broke the friendly union.
And what does this new Engagement speak unto you? but that their intentions are
to rule from henceforth by the Sword; and without all Law, (save that of war)
to keep you under. You may remember at first, 'twas King and Parliament they
cried up, then Parliament and Kingdom, but now at length it is come to be the
Parliament and the Army: so that you see how unsettled they are; how God has
made them like to a wheel in continual motion, and therefore no confidence is
to be put in them.

They promise now that they will setle the Kingdom without the King; who
unsettled it but themselves? and for what cause did they so, but that themselves
might reign over us? and will they lay down their Rule, Authority and Power?
surely no; and yet this they must be forced to do before the Kingdom will ere
be settled. But how will they settle this Kingdom without the King? even as they
have settled Ireland: they would never be quiet (as you all know) till the
management of the war there (which themselves also (as is now believed) had an
hand in raising,) might be wholly in their hands, with exclusion of His
Majesty, (whom God has appointed:) and too many of you the people (in the
simplicity of your spirits) were for them against your Sovereign; and desired
that the Parliament without the King might take order for that Business, and
now you understand too plainly how well they have ordered the same, these two
last years in special (while they had nothing else to mind, and have kept so
many lazy Officers and Soldiers to burden and oppress you.) O how do the poor
neglected and straved Soldiery in that lost Kingdom, as well as the ruinated
Protestants there, pour forth now their deserved execrations, and curses
against these deceitful and false-hearted men! How are they now brought to
believe and forced to confess, that none is, nor was, so tenderly affected
toward them as the King, and that Gods blessing will not concur with any
endeavors there, till they be managed again by Him, whom God has entrusted!
O remember Ireland, remember Ireland, Happy may you be yet once again in this
Kingdom, if the miseries which have been felt in that, (since these new Masters
took upon them to be the sole disposers of affairs there) may make you wary;
O take heed therefore in due time you do not believe them, when they say, they
will settle the Peace of this Kingdom without the King.

Again, they promised to set up Jesus Christ in the Throne of his Kingdom,
but they meant themselves only in the Throne of this: for do you not see how
they have gone about it, and how far they have advanced their work in 7.
years? Have they not imprisoned and turned out of Gods Vineyard the most
faithful and painful Laborers; forbidden them to preach in that name; or to
publish that truth which this Church professes, and themselves protested to
maintain? How many Congregations at this present want Pastors in this famous
City? and how many thousand Parishes are destitute in the Countries of right
teaching? now for what cause is all this? why are Gods Prophets thus knocked
off from their employments? wherefore are they inhibited the doing of their
duties? is it for any thing else, then because they inveigh against that
wickedness which God abhors? are they not for this sole reason said to be
enemies to the Parliament and to preach against that? why do they not say in
plain terms, the Parliament cannot sin? or that sin and that are all one, and
must not be reproved? or else (having nothing else to lay to their charge) why
do not they suffer Gods Messengers to declare their Embassage? or if they will
not so, let them (at least) discover themselves as openly in this, at they have
done in other particulars; for though they said as first, they took up Arms
to remove ill Counselors, and to bring Delinquents to punishment; yet now they
can speak out and say, it was to wrest the Legislative power and Militia out
of His Majesty's Hand: and though they promised at first to make the King MOST
GLORIOUS, yet now they blush not to proclaim we will not have this man to
reign over us, we will make no more addresses to Him, we will exercise
Authority without Him and against Him. So, though they promised at first to set
up Christ in His Throne, let them now tell us in plain English also, that they
mean to thrust Him, and all that truly profess Him (according to the right
Doctrine of the Gospel) out of this Land, for this is the very language of all
their Actions.

Again, they pretended great Emnity unto Popish Doctrines and Tenants; and
Episcopacy was pulled down out of zeal against Popery, (as if that had been a
friend unto it.) With what clamours did they represent unto the people
Secretary Windebanks intercourse with Jesuits, and Popish Priests; and the
Bishops Chaplains licencing of Books, supposed to be Popish; and yet these
very men have permitted Mabbot (the allowed Broaker of all these venomous
scriblings) to Authorize the Printing a book of Parsons the Jesuit, full of
the most Popish and Treasonable positions that were ever vented, for very good
Doctrine; nay more then this, have they not contributed 30. l. toward the
charge of Printing the same? and when (after its publication) it was told them
by some, that the said book had been condemned by Parliament in the 35. of
Queen Elizabeth, and that the Printer thereof was Hanged, drawn, and quartered
for the same; and that it was then enacted, that whosoever should have it in
their house, should be guilty of high Treason, when all this was related to
some of the Committee of Examinations, did they not stop their ears at it? did
they not slight those that thus spoke unto them? their own Consciences know
all this to be true; and that we are able to prove it before the World; yet
these be the men (forsooth) that hate Popery.

This Popish Book (which we speak of) was at first published Anno 1524. under
the name of Dolman, and entitled a conference about the succession of the
Crown, it consists of two parts, whereof the first conteines a discourse of a
Civil Lawyer, How and in what manner propinquity of blood is to be preferred:
it is divided into 9. Chapters: all which this blessed Reforming Parliament,
has now published under the Title of Several speeches delivered at a
conference concerning the power of Parliaments, to proceed against their King,
for misgovernment: they were all Answered (as they are in the Jesuits book)
by Sir John Haward Doctor of the Civil Law in the year 1603. and Dedicated to
King James (which Answer is common in Booksellers shops to be still sold.

Now there is no difference, betwixt this book published by this Parliament,
and that of the Jesuit condemned by that other, An. 35. Eliz. but only this:
when the Jesuit mentions the Apostles, He adds the word Saint to their names
S. John, S. James, S. Peter, which the Author of this new Edition leaves out,
and says plain John, James, and Peter: and perhaps in some places the word
Parliament is put instead of the word Pope, or people: nay the variation is so
little that it speaks the publisher a very weak man, and those that set him
on work none of the wisest in employing so simple an Animal, in a business of
so great concernment: we shall instance but in one passage.

Old Dolman or Parsons had said in the year 1594. that many were then living in
England, who had seen the several Coronations of King Edw. the 6. Queen Mary,
and Queen Eliz. and could witness, etc. Now our young Dolman or Walker (for
that is the wisemans name) supposing that all those people, were alive still
that were old men 54. years ago, like a true Transcriber, without the
variation of a letter, affirms it confidently, (in page 43. of his Edition)
that many are yet living in England, that have seen the several Coronations of
King Edw. the 6. Queen Mary, and Queen Eliz. (to which he also adds) King
James and King Charles (because they were crowned since) and this we confess is
new in him.

Now by this very book alone (though much more we might say to this purpose)
it is very evident, that these Children of Abaddon love the Jesuits Doctrine
well enough, so it comes not out in the Jesuits own name, if it be but
authorized by themselves or those appointed to publish and License books for
the Parliament: O then it is very excellent good and Orthodoxall.

And now shall not these doings so palpably vile and gross inflame your
spirits (O Englishmen) and quicken you up to free your selves from their
thraldom who thus abuse you? will you suffer them still to proceed till they
have stubbed up and quite o'rthrowne Christianity, from among you? you now see
plainly enough, what they meant at first by Root and branch: it was not
Episcopacy only Root and branch: but Monarchy also Root and branch; the King
and his Posterity Root and branch, the Nobility and Ancient Gentry Root and
branch. Peace and prosperity, honesty and Loyalty, Root and branch, with
Protestant profession it self, and all that good is, which in your
Protestation general you vowed to maintain; '^is fit you should observe it,
All the particulars in the said Protestation save only one, are already
averted and welnigh destroyed: the Religion and worship of Christ established
in the English Church, how is that suppressed and persecuted? His Majesty's
Person, Honor and Estate, how are they abused, blasted and imbezelled? the
Privileges of Parliament, Laws of the Land and Liberties of the Subject; how
notoriously have they been infringed, violated, and overthrown? there remains
now but one particular to finish the whole work of plucking up, or abolishing
the Protestation Root and branch, and that is breaking the union betwixt the
two Kingdoms of England and Scotland, which now also they are endeavoring to
effect, as appears sufficiently by their unfriendly, nay reproachful
Declaration against the Scotch Commissioners and indeed against the whole
Nation: and no question but they will (if they can) force many of those (whom
they have made to swear the contrary) to join with them in this breach also,
as they have done in all the former: if the Scots once begin to make conscience
of their old oath of Allegiance; and talk of their duty to their Sovereign
Lord the King, His Crown, and Dignity; of supporting His Power and Greatness,
according as they are bound by all Laws of God and nature; then away with these
fellows from the earth (cry those that resolve to make no more Addresses to the
King) it is not fitting they should live; though they were our dear Brethren
before, yet now they are so no more, but Malignants as well as other folks, and
fit for nothing but to have scorns, obloquies, and contempts cast upon them.

And here (by the way) let the Scottish Nation observe it well, and they shall
find upon trial, that those Loyal English, who from the beginning have
adhered to their King, out of Conscience and Allegiance, will be more careful
by all loving and friendly offices, to preserve peace, and unity, betwixt the
two Nations, from that Common bond of Christianity and humanity which ties us
all together, then those others are, or will ever be, who have taken so many
new Oaths, and Covenants to that purpose; all which, as they are unwarrantable,
(wanting Legality and life from the Sovereign) so will they prove invalid, and
too weak, to hold those who have ventured on them: nor were they intended (by
those State-engineers who first devised them) as Hen. Martin tells the world,
to bind the takers everlastingly to each other, or (indeed) to any other end,
then to drive on present designs, and to batter the Consciences and souls of
poor men; who are engaged by them (in very deed) to nothing else but to
Repentance.

But we return to those of our own Nation, who now (we think) have fully seen
the aims, scopes, and endeavors of these miscreant persons, that have
slighted all their Oaths, broken all parts of their Protestation, and are
guilty of all the crimes that can be named from the highest Treason to the
lowest Trespass; what is now therefore to be done by you, of this
Anciently-noble English Nation, but to stand up for your Religion, Laws, and
Liberties, to free your selves and Country from the insupportable Tyranny of
these usurpers: to bring these superlative Delinquents to condign punishment;
to endeavor speedily your Sovereigns restoration to His Dignity; and to
venture your lives, like good Christians and Gallant men, to deliver Him, that
so many years protected and defended you, and has now undergone (for your
sakes) such unparalleld sufferings as nothing is superior unto, but His
incomparable virtues, and which (alas!) so many of you, have ignorantly, (by
the fraudulent suggestion of these perfidious men) helped to bring upon Him?

Be you assured, that all those Arguments and Reasons, which they falsely urged
to stir you up to combine with them against him, are only good and to be
lawfully thought upon, to persuade you, to associate now against them. Had the
King been truly taxable of that they charged on Him; yet Gods word, Christian
verity, and the Law of the Land forbids Resistance: but they all command the
same against such as these, (though they were quite free from those other
villainies which they abound in:) even because they are usurpers: for there is a
vast difference between usurpers of Authority, and ill managers of lawful
Authority; betwixt those that take power to themselves to do mischief with
it, and those that exercise evilly that lawful power entrusted to them. Our
Savior (in the days of his flesh) would not so much as censure Pilate for his
cruel and bloody act, upon the Galileans, (when some did tempt him to it) that
he might not seem to countenance any, in so much as speaking evilly of lawful
power and authority, though abused. People when oppressed and wronged by their
lawful Superior, have allowance only to cry unto God, (as 1 Samuel 8.18.) and
to sue for relief by way of Petition, as the Israelites in Egypt did to
Pharaoh, when they were so cruelly used by his Taskmasters. But it is otherwise,
if men be usurpers, and set up themselves, as Abimelech the Bramble did Judge.
9. or endeavor to destroy the Royal Family, as Athaliah did: if they
oppress, (or whether they oppress or no) all men are bound to rise up against
them, and to help that Royal Person or Family to their right, that suffers
wrong by them; for fiat Iustitia aut ruet mundus, if Justice be not done in
such a case, the whole world it self (as may appear by the present temper of
this Kingdom) will fall to ruin presently.

As in a Family, if the Master or Father abuse his Authority; no Child or
Servant of right, can lift up an Hand against him; but if a Child or Servant
shall take upon him to domineere over all his fellows, and to abuse his Parent
or Master, all the rest ought (and will if wise) rise up against him, and help
their oppressed Governor to his power and place again: So it is, and doubtless
so it ought to be in a Kingdom.

A Kings ill usage or restraint, is a full warrant and commission to all His
Subjects, to Arm themselves for His liberty and restoration; the power is
never in the peoples hand, save in such a case: but then they are all to
advance as one man, in the behalf of their common Father; and to take those
lawless Wolves and Bears (they are Buchanans words) who have no more right of
authority over any, without their Sovereigns leave, (much less over Himself)
then vermin have (such as Weasels and Polcats are) over Hens and Chickens; yea
and until the people do so rise, they are (undoubtedly) not only under the
usurpers danger, but also under Gods heavy curse.

Curse ye Meroz (said the Angel of the Lord) curse ye with a bitter curse the
inhabitants thereof, because they came not to help the Lord, i. e. the Captain
of the Lord, the Anointed of the Lord, the Supreme Judge and Magistrate under
the Lord Against the mighty, that is, against those sturdy and rebellious
Canaanites, who were grown so mighty, (by that strength of Militia, and
Chariots of Iron which they had gotten) and did so mightily oppress Israel,
under whom they ought to have lived in obedience.

That Scripture (you all know) has been much used of late, and as much abused;
but it is never truly applyable save in such a case as this in present is: for
the Captain of the Lord is now in as much, yea in more distress, then at that
time; His people under as great oppressions; and the enemies as very Canaanites
as those were, as much the children of Malediction, if not more; for those were
under the curse partly for Cham their fathers sin, but these are solely for
their own; which has been not only of the same kind, as His was, (mocking
and scorning at their Father) but acted with more impudency and vileness a
great deal; for Cham found his father naked, but these have endeavored (by
this their cursed Declaration, and many others of like sort) to make theirs
appear so; yea they have proclaimed him naked when he was not; in a most
shameless manner they have shown their own nakedness, and then published it
to be their Fathers; and that not only to their Brethren (as He did) whose
piety and modesty was apt to hide and cover the same, (whose ere it was) but to
the whole world, to strangers, to enemies, that would be ready to credit the
same, and glad to divulge it farther to their Fathers defamation; which was the
very thing they aimed at; therefore these evil workers are more the people of
Gods curse, then those Canaanites were; nor had those provoked Gods wrath (so
much as these have done) by their breaches of so many oaths and protestations,
of Loyalty and Obedience; nor had they practiced more injustice and oppression;
therefore if they were designed to be subdued, and pulled down from their
usurped greatness; much rather may we believe that these are; and if Meroz was
liable to so sharp a doom, for not helping the Lord against them, then well
may we fear a like portion, if we be backward in our assistance to the
downfall of these men.

For are not these Gods enemies as well as any? nay more then any? Did true
Religion ever receive such disgrace and scandal as these have offered to it?
Did this famous Kingdom ever produce such monsters of Nature before now? Surely
the Kings of the earth, and the Inhabitants of the world would never have
believed (if these had not been to evidence the same) that the English Nation
could ever have bred such Vipers; or that among Protestant Christians there
should possibly have been such Malignant adversaries unto Piety and Princes.

Take courage therefore you may against them, (all ye who in Christ's name, and
the Kings behalf shall oppose them:) for their high and great wickedness
against God, speaks them out of his protection; as also does their confidence
in the Arm of flesh. For in very deed they make not God their strength (what
ever is pretented;) nor ever did, but the Militia rather, for which they have
contested: that is their Magazine of Hope, and Tower of Safety: their trust is,
and has been in the multitude of their Weapons, their Armies of Men, their
numerous Associations, and their plenty of ill gotten Riches, wherewith they
have, and think still to bribe and buy off those, whom by force and power they
cannot master.

And these be the sparks which they have kindled, and compass themselves
about withal: These be the very fires they rejoice in, the stays they rest
upon, but says the Lord to such as they are, that do as they do; This shall ye
have of my Hand, ye shall lie down in sorrow, Isay 50.11.

And do we not daily see the things that are coming upon them, making have?
Are not their Hearts unjoynted from one another? Is not their Kingdom divided,
their Associations broken? Are not they that were girded fastest to them,
fallen from them? How loudly do all persons every where cry out upon them? How
generally odious are they become of late, who were before so much adored? How
much greater now among all men is the Hatred of them then the fear? Who looks
not upon them as the people of Gods Curse? as the very poison and pestes of the
Kingdom? who believes not that divine vengeance hangs over the Land, while
they walk at liberty in it? see, see and consider it well; how spider-like
they have been caught in their own nets, and snared in the work of their own
Hands; How have they befooled themselves in their own doings; How has their
scandalous Declaration against the King raised plenty of fewd in men's hearts
against themselves? has not all their filthy some spit out therein against
Him, flew wholly back into their own faces? is not His Majesty become thereby
more dear and precious to His people, and themselves far more detestable? are
their solemn Orders or Ordinances, entertained with any more respect now, then
scorn it self can afford them? do not most men as slightly receive whatever
comes from them, as themselves have done the Kings Messages?

And whence now is all this? who has effected and brought to pass these
things? has not the Lord? and do they not plainly speak the approaching end
of these men, or of their greatness and prosperity? are not all these
particulars, so many evident prognostics of their ruin? and may they not be
taken too as so many invitations from God, to rouse up our selves against them,
and as so many intimations of His concurrence with us in such endeavors? nay,
and it is to be noted too, when the Almighty (for our encouragement and hope)
did begin thus to work, it was at such a time, as these usurpers were at their
greatest height, when they cried out with open mouth who is Lord over us? ours
is the power and we will prevail. When they had resolved to make no more
Addresses to the King, but to do as themselves pleased, without Him and against
Him. Then, then did our God awake as one out of sleep; then did he set
himself against these men to confound them in their ways, and to expose them
to this public contempt and scorn of all; And it is Gods course if he once
begins, not to leave off, till he has made an end too, Root and branch in a
short time; the spirit says it, branch and rush in one day.

Indeed the Lord has been fitting them for their shame a great while; He has
left them to themselves because they regarded not to know God, or to please
him; He has given them up to a reprobate sense (as a punishment for their sin)
not to take notice of his hand going out against them, threatening ruin and
extirpation of them: yea he has blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts
to forsake their own mercy: He infatuated their spirits to loose those
oportunities so frequently offered, and to despise the profers of peace so
often tendered, whereby they might have been secured. Now as pride goes before
destruction, so folly (we know) precedes a fall.

Undoubtedly the Lords purpose is, to make them the astonishment of the world
for confusion and misery, as they have made themselves the amazement of the
world for wickedness and impiety: He will bring upon them, all the blood which
they have shed, all the guilt thereof, and so of all the blasphemies which they
have vented, he shall make them vomit up again all the wealth of others which
they have swallowed, according to their substance shall the restitution be: for
shall not the Judge of all the earth (when he takes the matter into his own
hand) do righteously? never a persecutor or opressor, never an Apostle or
false Traitor, never a Parliament Sheba, or Pulpit Shimei of them all, but
shall meet with his due demerit from him who has pronounced of them, or of
such as they be; that they shall lie down in sorrow.

And thus you see what hopes there be of your speedy deliverance, (O ye
miserably oppressed English) if you will now arise as one man, and show your
selves: you see how God is already gone out against your enemies, How his
Justice is engaged for you, and does march before, to invite you to follow
after. And if you look but on the other side, you may see his mercy as
manifestly appearing for your further encouragement. How has that gracious
Prince (whose servants you are) not slain, but Conquered his thousand, his ten
thousand, yea his hundred thousand of hearts and men? and that not with sword
or spear, or any instrument of war; but by they sole strength of Gods mighty
spirit, animating his soul in his great Afflictions, and carrying him on high,
above the waters. How has He like the glorious Sun, by the bright lusture of
His Graces, broake through all those black clouds of calumny and slander,
whereby these enemies of Majesty have labored to obscure Him? How has He by
his wisdom, meekness, patience, and constant tenders of mercy to His
greatest enemies recovered, yea and overcome (as Christ himself did) the minds
and affections of His people? How has His miseries for their sakes turned the
streams of their love toward Him? surely this is the Lords doing; the victory
is welnigh already won for us, by Gods sole strength in the Person of our
Sovereign.

How does their black mouthed Balaams, who for the wages of iniquity have spit
out so much venom against His ^ajesty, (whom they never had more knowledge of,
then was brought unto them by His deadly enemies,) How do they now even gnash
their teeth, and gnaw their tongues for sorrow; to here how His virtues are
admired, and His graces reverenced: to feel how His splendor has darkened
them, by causing their vileness to appear, in dissipating the slanders and
dissolving the filth, which (with so much pains and pulpit sweat) they had
labored to bespatter him with, seven years together.

And now; are not these most evident marks of Gods favor to the King, and
that His mercies are also engaged on His side, as well as His Justice, and will
be on yours if you are for Him? It Is true, God has seemed to sleep long to the
cause of His Anointed, that the incredible and high wickedness of the enemy
might be known; and the invisible or inward excellencies of the King seen; but
both these ends being now accomplished, the time is fully come of Gods arising,
which will be the indoubted cause of His enemies scattering.

What (therefore) does now remain for you to do (O English people) but to make
haste in the first place, to fetch back your King to His Throne and Dignity, in
despite of those that keep Him Prisoner: See, see how the Ancient Britains
move already: nay, see how the Scots do promise to appear: Have not you cause
to think that they intend to plead with you, (as Judah did with Israel,) for
the Honor of the work; because the King is near of kin to them? but have not
you ten parts in Him, and so more right in this David now, then they, and
reason to be as early in view unto this service? assuredly, though we gave the
Scots leave to be the first, in departing from duty; yet we should all blush,
not to be (at least) as forward as they, in returning to it: nay, we should all
like good Christians, and penitent men, contend in love both with them, and one
another, who shall be the foremost.

And then let us all as one man conjoyne in this; to require of our false
Stewards a present account of their stewardships: let us resolve upon it, that
they shall no longer be stewards for us, because they have made such waste of
our goods, and of what ever else was dear unto us; and if they refuse to come
to an account at such our call, let us force them to it; full sore shall we sin
against God, and the whole Kingdom, if we still permit them in their places:
we can do no wrong in bringing them to a Legal trial, (which is the thing we
must aim at:) if they have (as they say) defended the Law, no doubt but the
Law will defend them: but if they have broaken or labored to destroy that,
(which they pretended to maintain, and were entrusted by us so to do) it is
but just and right, that they by it should be corrected.

And the disturbers of our peace being taken down or removed from us; let us
then call to mind that we are all of the same Nation, and were partakers of
the same Baptism; and therefore ought to lay aside that which presses down,
or hardneth our Hearts against one another, to put away what ever hinders from
closing together in affections: it may suffice that we have played the fools
hitherto, gone astray and quarreled all this while for we know not what: we
must now remember whence we have fallen, and return to our first Love, to our
bounden duty: our Sovereign like the Prodigalls Father, (as appears by his many
gracious Messages) is inclined to receive us; the Church like a tender hearted
Mother, ( that cannot forget the children of her womb) will (upon our
repentance) be ready to pardon us, and to solicit our Heavenly Father for us.
Those that have suffered wrong must be disposed to forgive; those that have
done wrong must be willing to restore what they have unjustly seized upon; that
so all impediments to Heaven, and Peace may be removed, and we no more return
to folly.

And lastly, that there may be a well grounded peace indeed, betwixt the two
Nations of England and Scotland; and that we may live together, as Brethren
ought to do: let those of that Kirk, who are yet so zealous for their
Covenant, that they would have it forced upon their Soverain, and the people of
this Kingdom, (as if it were the very foundation of Christian Religion, and as
necessary as the Gospel it self:) Let them be pleased to consider calmely and
seriously, how little of Gods blessing both they and we have had, since the
first birth of it: how the Reformation (so much talked on) has been
obstructed: How the Protestant profession formerly planted has been defaced:
How the Enemy of that and mankind has sown the tares of false Doctrine,
since (to promote the Covenant) so many of the Clergy, have omitted to walk in
those ways of peace, humility, and obedience which Gods word prescribes; How
much contention and bloodshed has been caused, how many Sects and Heresies
have sprung up, How much blasphemy has been vented, what strange perverseness
of spirit, and unreverent language has been used against Sovereign Majesty,
what little manners has been shown unto superiors, what occasions sought to
quarrel with them, what catching at their words, what wresting and
mis-interpreting of their writings and sayings, and all (as has appeared) out
of zeal unto the Covenant. O that they would please to consider of these
things; and withal to remember that Christianity commands morality and to give
to every men his due, fear to whom fear, and honor to whom honor belongs;
it requires singleness of heart, and injoynes to us deny our selves to please
others, that they would hereupon desist to pursue with such heat their own
fancy, they knowing it to be point-blanke against an Act of their Parliament,
1585. (which utterly prohibits all Leagues, Covenants, or bands whatsoever,
without the Kings consent. And that they would also take notice, how
inconsistent their said Covenant is, with the constitution and temper of this
our Kingdom: How it is not only broken, but derided, and scorned at now by many
of those, who were at first very furious for it. In a word, that they would
believe the English Nation in general, does as little like of what is put upon
them by the Scots, as the Scots did, of what was sent unto them from the
English; to speak plainly and truly, we have generally as little affection to
their Covenant, as they had (when time was) to our Book of Common Prayer, and
shall as ill digest it.

Nor indeed are the English Nobility and Gentry so weak spirited, as those of
Scotland may appear to be, in letting their Clergy, (the chief promoters of the
Covenant) under pretense of that to act the Pope among them; by obstructing the
progress of Civil affairs, and meddling in State matters. Should our
Churchmen (as those there have lately done) put in bars against the Kings
settling, or say that themselves must have satisfaction before the King be
restored to the exercise of His Regal power: with what disdain would our
right Nobility, and true Gentry, (yea and well instructed Commonalty too)
receive the same; they would reply upon them in this sort, and say: what
warrant have you from Gods word to speak after this manner? you that should by
your office and Ministry be teachers and patterns to all, of humility and
obedience, will you Lord it, and that not only over Gods flock, but over his
Shepherd too, his Supreme of all? must not He enjoy His own right, His
place, His Inheritance, nor exercise that power which God has committed to
Him, without your leave? much less shall any of us shortly (that are inferior
to Him) command over our own possessions without your allowance if we listen
to you in this thing: surely, you take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi: they
are the Kings of the Earth (says your Master Christ) that are to exercise
Authority over men, and (by your favor) over the Clergy too; and not the
Clergy over Kings: if you are for that sport, go pack to Rome among your
fellows.

Thus should we in England be answered, and put off, with due rebukes, if we
should be so drawn away from Scripture and from duty by a Scottish Covenant:
And therefore it would be good, if those in that Kingdom, who are still such
zelots for it; would please in cool blood to consider of it; and (according to
the Apostles council) study quietness, mind their own business: and as
Solomon advises, lean no more to their own understanding, Idolize no longer
their own devices, press no further their own inventions: rather let them and
we (as becomes members of one Christ, and Subjects of one King) conjoyne first
in restoring our Sovereign to His Throne and power: and then in begging of
Him, that a General Council or Assembly may be called, of the most Learned,
peaceable, and grave men in all his Kingdoms: to argue with meekness (as
becomes the Gospel) the cases of difference that are amongst us: And to their
determinations (ratified by the King,) let us all submit with ready hearts and
humble minds: So shall the luster and Honor of our Protestant profession be
recovered, which (by these unhappy jars) has been defaced: the peace of many
Consciences shall be settled; Sects, Heresies, and False Doctrines shall be
suppressed; tranquillity, light, and love shall be again restored to the people
of both Nations; And we, (if we are the happy instruments of this,) shall
hereby increase our Comfort, Crown and Glory.

Now the God of all Grace, pour upon us all his Spirit of Grace, to work up
our Spirits to an holy frame, and Christian temper. Amen. Amen.

FINIS.
