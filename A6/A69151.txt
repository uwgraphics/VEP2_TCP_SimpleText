THE DANGER wherein the Kingdom now stands, and the Remedy.

Printed, 1628.

AS soon as the House of Austria had incorporated it self with Spain, and by
their new Discoveries gotten to themselves the wealth of the Indies, they began
to affect and have ever since pursued a first Monarchy.

The Emperor CHARLES the fifth would first lay the foundarion thereof in Italy,
by surprising Rome: from this, he was thrust by the force and respect of
Religion: HENRY 8. being made Caput foederis against him. He then attempted it
in high Germany, practicing by faction and force to reduce them first to Petty
States, and so to his absolute power. Thus HEN: 8. again prevented him, by
tying the Lutheran Princes under his confederacy and assistance. His soon the
second PHILIP, pursued the same ambition in the Nether Germany, by reduction
whereof he intended to make his farther way into the other. This the late
Queen of England interrupted, by siding with the afflicted people on the one
part, and making her self the head of their Protestants league with the
Princes on the other: drawing in as a secret of State the countenance of
France, to give the more reputation, and assistance to them, and security to it
self.

Spain seeing his hopes fruitless by those unions ands straights, began first
to break if he may the amity of France and England; but finding the common
danger to be a fast tie, he raises up in that Kingdom a faction of his
own, by which the French King was distressed, that had not the English
Counsel and assistance relieved him, Spain had there removed that next and
greatest obstacle of his ambition: his Counsel now tells him from these
Examples, that the way to this great work is impassable, so long as England
lays a net in his way; and the remove of that must be the first of his
intents.

This drew on those secret practices often against the Queen, and his open
fury in 88. against the State; which she seeing by following the advice of a
free Counsel, would never after admit of Peace, winning thereby the hearts of
a loving people, who ever found hands and money at home, and keeping sacredly
her Aliances abroad, securing to her Confederates all her time, freedom from
Spanish flattery, and so ended her old and happy days in glory.

Spain then by the wisdom and power of that great Lady dispoiled of his
means to hurt, though not of his desires, makes up with her peaceful
Successor of happy Memory, that golden League, that discerning us at home by
opinion of security, and giving them a power in our Counsel by believing
their friendships, and pretented marriages, gave them a way to cherish amongst
us a party of their own belief, of power abroad to lead in jealousy, and
sow division between us and our confederates, by which we se they have
swallowed up the fortune of our Masters brother, with the rest of the Imperial
States; distressed the K. of Denmark, by that quarrel, diverted the Swedens
assistance by the wars with the Pole, and maining him now with the ofex of
the Danish Crown. And now whether from the plot, or our fatalitie, it has
cast such a bone between France and us, as has made themselves by our quarrel
of Religion a fast Confederate, and us a dangerous Enemy: so that now we are
left no other assurance against their malice and ambition, but the
Netherlanders where the tie of mutual safety is weakened, by daily discontents
bred and fed between us, from some ill affected to both our securities; that
by the doubtfulnes of friendship, as we now stand, we may rather suspect from
our own domesticke faction: if they grow too furious, they will rather follow
the example of Rome in her growing, that held it equal safety, honorable and
more easy dare Regem, then subiugare Proviciam, considering the power they
have in their hands, then to give any friends assistance to serve the present
condition of our state.

You may therefore see in what terms we stand abroad, and I fear me at home
for resistance in no better state: There must be to withstand a foreign
invasion, a proportion both of Sea and Land forces for to give an Enemy an
easy passage, and a Port to relieve him in, is no less then to hazard all at
one stake; and it is to be considered, that no march of land can be of that
speed to make head against the landing of an Enemy, nor no such prevention as
to be master of the Sea: To this point of necessary defense, there can be no
less the^ 24000. for the Land forces: if it were for an offensive war, the
men of less liuelihood were the best spared, and were used formerly to make
such war Purgamento Repub: if we made no farther purchase by it: and for a
safety of a Commonwealth, the wisdom of all times did never interesse the
public cause to any other, then such as have a portion in the public
adventure, and that we saw in 88. when the care of the Queen and Counsel did
make the body of that large Army no other then the trained band with which the
auxiliaries of the whole Realm amounted to no less then 24000. men; neither
was any of these drawn from forth their Countries and proper habitations
before the end of May, that there must be no long agrievance to the public:
such discontentments being even to us a more fatal Enemy then any foreign
Force: the careful distribution and direction of their sea and land Forces,
being more fitting for a Counsel of war, then a private man to advise of. I
pass it over, yet willing when I shall be called humbly to offer up such
observations as I have formerly gathered by the former like occasions in this
Realm.

To make up this preparation, there is requisite two things; Money, and
Affections, for they cannot be properly severed.

It was well and wisely said of the great Counselor the L. BVRLEIGH in the
like case to the Queen, win hearts and you have their hands and purses. And I
find that of late, diffidence having bin a defect in the one, it has
unhappily produced the other.

In gathering then of money for this present need, there is requisite three
things, Speed, assurance, and satisfaction, and the way to gather as others in
the like case have done, must be by that paith-way that is called, Via Regia;
being more secure and speedy, for by unknown and untrodden ways it is both
rougher and tedious, and seldom succeeds: this last way although it took
place as it were by a supply at first, and received no general denial; yet
since, it has drawn many to consult with themselves and others in the
consequence, and is now conceived as a pressure on their Liberties and against
Law; I much fear, if now again it be offered either in the same face, or by
privy Seal, it will be refused wholly; neither find I it, that the
restraint of those Recusants have produced any other effect then a stiff
resolution in them and others to forbear: besides, although it went at first
with some assurance, yet when we consider your Commissions and other forms
incident to such like services; that how long it hangs in hand, the many
delays that we may easily see, that such a sum by Parliament granted is
far sooner and more easily gathered.

If any make the successions of time, to produce an inevitable necessicitie to
enforce it; if denied, whether in general, or by excise, or by imposition, or
particular in some select persons, which is the custom of some Countries, and
so conclude it as therefore the public state Suprema Sege, he must look for
this to be told them; that seeing necessity must conclude always to gather
money as less speedy or assured, then that so practiced, which cannot be
fitter then by Parliament, the success attends the humor of the heedlesse
multitude, that are full of jealousy and distrust; and so unlike to comply to
any usual course of leavie but by force, which if used the effect is
fearful, and has been fatal to this state: where as that by Parliament
rests principally on the Regal person, who may with ease and safety mould
them to his fit desires, by a gracious yiedling to their just Petitions.

If a Parliament then be most speedy, assured and safe way, it is fit to
conceive what is the fairest way to act and work it to the present need:
first, for the time of the usual summons, reputed to be 40. days, to be too
large for this present necessity; it may be by the dating of the writs
lessened, since it is no positive Law, so that care be had that there be but
one County day; if then, the same to be leavied be once agteed of for the
time: in the body of our grant there may be assignement made to the Knights of
every Shire and County respectively, who under such assurance may safely give
security proportionable to the receipts, to such as shall advance in present
for the public service any sums of money,

The last and weightiest consideration if a Parliament be thought fit, is how
to remove or comply the differences between the King and the Subjects in their
mutual demands, and what I have learned amongst the better sort of the
multitude, I will freely declare, that your Lordships may be more enabled to
remove and answer those distrusts, that either concern Religion, Public
safety of the King and state, or the just liberties of the Commonwealth: for
Religion is a matter that they lay nearest to their conscience, and they are
led by this ground of jealousy, to doubt some practice against it: First, for
that the Spanish match was broken by the grateful industry of my Lord of
Buck: out of his religious care; as there he declared, that the Articles there
demanded, in some such sufferance as may endanger the quiet if not the state of
the reformed Religion here. Yet there have (when he was a principal actor in
the conditions of France) as hard, if not worse to the preservation of our
Religion passed, then those with Spain; and the suspect is strenghthened, by
the close keeping of his agreements; In the point there concluded.

It is no less argument of a doubt to them of his affectios, in that his
Mother and others, many of his Ministers in near employment about him are so
affected, they talk much of his advancing, men papistically devoted so placed
in the Camp of nearest service and chief command; and that the Recusants have
got these late years by his power, more of courage then assurance) then
before. If to clear these doubts (which perhaps are worse in fancy then in
truth) he take a course, it might much advance the public service against
the squeamish humors, that have more a violent passion then settled judgment,
and are not the least of the opposite number in the commonwealth.

The next, is the late losses, misfortunes, and losses both of men and
munition, and how in our late undertakings abroad, which the more temperate
spirits impute to want of counsel, and the more sublime wits to practice.

They began with the Palatinate and lay the fault of the loss there, on the
improved credit of GONDAMOR distrusting him for the staying of supplies to Sir
HORACE VEERE, when Collonell CECILL was cast on that employment: by which the
King of Spain became the Mr. of the Kings Childrens inheritance; And when
Count MANSFIELD had a royal supply of forces to assist the Princes of our part
for the recovery thereof, either plot or error defeated the enterprise for us
to Spaines advantage; That Sir ROBERT MANSFIELDS expedition to Argiers, should
purchase only the security and guard of the Spanish coasts; To spend so many
100000. l. in the Cales voyage against the advice of the Parliament, only to
warn the King of Spain to be in a readiness and so weaken our selves, is
taken for such a sign of ill affection to him amongst the multitude; The
spending of so much munition and victuals, and money, in my Lord WILLOVHBIES
journey, is conceived an unthrifty error in the director of it, to disarme our
selves in fruitless voyages, may (to seem over curious) seem a plot of
danger, to turn the quarrel of Spain our ancient enemy; that the Parliament
peticioned and gave supply to support upon our Allies of France, and so some
after (a new and happily) gave much talk that we were not so doubtful of
Spain as many wish since? it was held not long ago a fundamental rule of
theirs and our security, by the old Lord BVRLEIGH, that nothing can prevent the
Spanish Monarchy, but a fastness of the two Princes whole amity, gave
countenance and courage to the Netherlanders and German Princes to make head
against his ambition, and we see by this disunion a fearful defeat has
happened to Denmark, and that party to the advantage of the Austrian family,
and thus far of the waste of public treasure in fruitless expeditions, and
an important cause to hinder any new supply in Parliament: another fear that
may disturb the smooth and speedy passing of the Kings desire in Parliament,
is the late waste of the Kings liuelyhood whereby is like and in former times
to arise this jealousy and fear that when he has not of his own to support
his ordinary, for which the lands of the Crown were settled unalterable and
called sacra Patrimonium Principes, that then he must of necessity rest to
those assistances of the people, which ever were collected and Consigned for
the Commonwealth: from hence it is like there will be no great labor and
stiffenesse to enduce his Majesty to an act of resumption, since such desires
of the state have found an easy way in the will of all Princes from the 3.
HEN. to the last, but that which is like to pass the deeper to their disputes
and care, is the late pressures they suppose to have been done upon public
liberties and freedom of the subject, in commanding their goods without assent
by Parliament, confining their persons without especial cause declared, and
that made good by the Judges lately, and pretending a writ to command their
attendance in a foreign war; all which they are like to enforce as repugnant
to many positive laws and customary immunities of this Commonwealth; and
these dangerous distrusts to the people are not a little improved by his
unexampled course, as they conceive an Inland army in winter season, when
forms times of greatest fear produced no such, Anno. 88.
and makes therein their distracted fear, to conjecture idly, it was raised
wholly to subject their fortunes to that will of power, then of law, and so
make good some farther breach upon their liberties and freedom at home, then
defend from any force abroad: how far at home such jealousies (if they met
with any unusual disorder of lawless Soldiers) or unapt distemper of the
loose and needy multitude, which will easily turn away upon any occasion, in
the State they can side with a glorious pretense of Religion and public
safety, when their true end will be only rapine of the rich (and ruin of
all) is worthy a provident and preventing care.

I have thus far delivered that (that which freedom you pleased to admit
such difficulties as I have taken up amongst the multitude) which may avert if
not remove impediments to any speedy supply in Parliament at this time, which
how to facilitate may better become the care of your Lordships judgments then
my ignorance, only wish, that to remove away a personal distaste of my Lord of
Buck: amongst the people, he might be pleased if there be a necessity of
Parliament, to appear a first adviser thereunto, and what satisfaction it
shall please his Majesty of grace to give at such time to his people, which I
would wish to be grounded with present of his best and fortunate progenitors,
and which I conceive will largely satisfy the desires and hopes of all, if it
may appear in some sort to be drawn down from him to the people, by the
zealous care and industry that my Lord of Buck: has of the public unity and
content by which there is no doubt, but he may remain not only secure from
any farther quarrel with them, but merit happy memory amongst them of a
zealous Patriot, for to expiate the passion of the people at such time with
sacrifice of any of his Majesty's servants, I have ever found (as in Edw. 2.
Rich. 2. Hen. 6.) no less fatal to the master then the minister in the end.

FINIS.
