To the Christian readers, and hearers, S.
OF the great subscription urged from the Pastors and ministers of the word
and Sacraments in a great part of this land the last year, ye can not
lightly be ignorant. The causes of the same being either secret, I cannot: or
not convenient to be published, I may not set down. What the event thereof will
be, God he knows: what it has been, according to the diversity of man's
mind, diversely do men think thereof. For some are of opinion that much hurt
thereby has redounded to the Church of God, and they think not amiss in
diverse considerations: others, (again) wisely do suppose that it has made not
a little unto the glory of God, and comfort of his servants, as whereby a full
and perfect trial of men is had, and diverse of the godly notably be delivered
from the manifold slanders, and wicked surmises falsely raised of them through
the secret, and subtle suggestions of Satan, and his members.

For, to speak first of her Majesty's authority in causes Ecclesiastical,
(and that to offend none of Gods children, but to the consolation of many) of
all that have bine examined, what one has denied the same? who but most
willingly, and cheerfully does ascribe so much as the laws of this land in
every respect do give unto her highness? Who but has offered, as to subscribe,
so to swear unto that article? Who but would suffer the loss, not of goods
only, but of life also, for the maintenance of the same?

And although the Papists do write, that to grant this unto her majesty, is
loathsome and base flattery Answer to the Execut. of Justice c. 8, p. 207.
, abominable and blasphemous adulation Ibi. c. 8, p. 198.
, shameful haeresie, and untruth Ibi. c. 8, p. 195
, against nature Ibi. c. 7, p. 159.
, and is not to make her next to God in her Realm, but to make her the God of
her people Ibi. c. 8, p. 298.
: For the next step, say theie, (unto divine adoration) is to say and
believe, that a temporal King is above the Priest in causes Ecclesiastical, or
that in a Christian common weal the next dignity to Christ, or God is not the
priest* but the Prince: yet can we not to avoid the aeternal displeasure of
God, but think it, and to show our selves dutiful, and loial subjects,
subscribe unto the same, having learned so to do out of Gods holy word.

As for the supremacy challenged by the Pope, whom (as heretofore, so daily,
but most sacrilegiouslie) theie call The general pastor Answer to the Execut. of
Justice c. 6. p. 131.
, yea, The common Father of al Christians, specialie of princes Ibi. c. 6, p.
121.
, yea, The chief priest and pastor of our souls Ibi. c. 5, p. 96.
, yea, The supreme pastor of Gods faithful people Ibi. c, 8, p, 193.
, yea, The high pastor of Christ's universal Church Ibi. c, 3, p, 52.
: and, to omit a number of such blasphemous titles, The prince of Gods people
Ibi. in the preface.
: as we know no such praerogatiue given him by the word of God, so we do
utterly renounce, and altogether mislike the same.

And, to come unto another Article concerning the book of common prayer, not
one, that I know, has refused simply to subscribe unto that neither. Though
some deny not only that that form, but that any form of public, and
ordinary prayer is to be used in the Church, and think it papistical, and give
out that it does but mock the Lord, and the Lord loatheth, and spueth it out
of his mouth ^. H. upon the 122. Psalm. pub. anno 1^83.
: though some again write that it has no part of the catholic service
Howlet in his 4. reason.
, and call it a Caluinistical Answer to the Execut. of Justice, c. 3, p. 50.
, a schismatical Ibi. c, 1, p, 1^.
, a damnable schismatical Ibi, c, 3, p, 38.
, an heretical Ibi, c, 2, p, 28* c, 8, p, 174.
, an abominable service Ibi. c. 1. p. 14.
, (These be the ^^^^dest and charitable words of them whom, theie say, no
protestant in England is able to reprove of a^^^ untruth, or slander, railing,
immodestie, etc. Ibi, c. 9, p, 212.
:) yet what is that unto us? which of al Gods ministers that have bine tried
can justly be charged so much as to favor, much less to maintain those
ungodly assertion? And the auctors too, who are theie? Not nightbirds? Not
light hedded, and fugitive persons? Not our professed and known enemies?

It may not be denied, but some do withold their pens from approving that
holy book in every point by subscription: yet are there none, I trust, that
proudly contemn it, none that disdainfulie despise it, none but in the fear
of God, and in pub. Churches always, and only do use it, and many have set
their hands there-unto, and al, I doubt not but so would, were that which is
offensive, reformed; and that which is crooked, made straight; and that which
is doubtful, made evident and plain. Which things also are for number but
very few, and, therefore may the more easily be removed: and remain, for
the most part, in the directions and rubricks, and therefore with less offense
may be taken away.

Neither does any minister of the word, that I hear, deny by subscription to
allow the book concerning the Articles, and sum of our faith, but what laws
do exact, or enioine most willingly have theie offered to perform. And no
cause is there why we should not so do: the auctors of the same do move; the
sovereign authority, whereby it was established, and is vpholden, does move;
but the necessary, and al Christian doctrine there-in comprised, does most of
al move us, not only in heart to like thereof, but with mouth also, and every
way to praise it, and to glorify the goodness of God for the same. Our
forefathers many of them desired to see that, though it were but secretly,
and to the hazarding of their lands, goods, and lives, which in that book we
openly and publicly to our unspeakable comfort, and profit do see
maintained.

Besides, it is the badge of Eng. Christians whereby we are known to the
universal world not only to agree with all the godly that have bine or do
live at this present in the material points of religion: but also to disagree
from the Jews, Turks, Papists, Anabaptists, and al other profane men. So that
theie, or he which shall with-drawe his hand from allowing the same, may
vehemently be suspected to be a contemner of the sacred authority of this
noble realm, and of the doctrine of Christ; a dissenter not only from all the
godly in this land, and therefore not worthy to live among us: but also from
the true Christians who both have lived heretofore, and remain in any
reformed Church at this present time; and a fauorer either of the Jewish, or
Turkish, or Popish, or Anabaptistical, or some ungodly, and cursed opinion, or
other.

These things (one of the weakest of my brethren known I confess, yet through
confidence in our chief captain Jesus Christ, whose al power is Matthew. 28, 18.
) I have undertaken to prove in two books or treatises: the former whereof is
now before you, the other in good time, if so it please God, shall come abroad,
In which advisedly look, and ye shall perceive, that the Religion established
by the authority, and professed of al degrees in this land, is neither a false

embraced.

Again, besides that all the enemies of name, which the truth has had from
time to time even til this very hour be here discovered, ye shall so cleerlie
and plainly behold, as any thing ye may when the Sun gloriously does
show himself, that Popery is not the only true worship of God Answer to the
Execut. of Justice, c, ^, p. 103.
; that Popery is not consonant to (God) his sacred word and will Ibi c, 8, p,
180.
; but planted by weak and wicked men; that Popery is not the old Religion Ibi
c. 2, p, 19. c. 3, p, 36, c, 9, p, 211
, but a new, or more truly a loathsome Chaos of all condemned haeresies, and
antichristian opinions; and that Popery agrees not with the church of God in
this land, or in any other country or city, almost in no one substantial and
material point of Christianity, and so is not the Catholic or c^^^on
Religion Answer to the Execut. of Justice, in the preface.
, as theie commonly give out. And therefore is to be detested: and the
teachers ^^ereof, whether Seminaries, or others, to be held accursed Gal. 1. 8,

: and the maintainers of the same as ^^ch to be taken heed of, as the Arrian,
Nestorian, Pelagian, and such like haeretikes that have lived heretofore: or as
the Jews, Turks, Anabaptists, which trouble the world in these days. And
therefore right* godly wisdom and Christian magnanimity has our sovereign
Queen, and her noble Counsel declared, in suffering the papists, being more
dangerous to the Realm, and as hurtful to the true and Catholic religion, to
have no more favor either publicly in temples, or privately in houses to
assemble themselves together, than the Jews, or Turks: the contrary whereof
as they excedingly do wish Answer to the Execut. of Justice, c. ^* p, (...).
: so we trust shall never come to pass, notwithstanding the marvelous opinion
they have in their Gregory the 13. that now is Pope, who theie hope shall once

And having noted these things judge in the name of God, both what he was that

sects, as theie say, false religions, and whether the professors of this
Creed be out of the Church, as one Howlet par. 1.

peace, and security in this world Ibi. c. 8, p. 19^.
: and whether Papists are to be cherished as good catholic Christians Ibi. c.
9.
, and the hot Protestants which most carefulie embrace al these religious
Articles, to be punished, as the Screecher would insinuate Howlet in his
preface.
.

Besides, for so much as the Papists do not only think, but also giue-out, that
we are at ferce contention among our selves, let them advisedly consider,
either how all the Protestant Churches in Europe do subscribe unto our
Articles, or we unto their confessions, and then tell what our dissension is. It
may be they will say, al reformed Churches subscribe not to every of our
Articles. But many do, and none deny, I say not any of our Articles, but
not any one Thesis, or proposition of any Article common to al Christians. I
grant some confessions be larger than other some are, and contain more matter
of Christianity than others do: yet are theie not contrary, no more than
Athanasius Creed is contrary to the Apostles, because it is larger; nor the
Decaloge is contrary to the moral Law, because it is the sum of it; nor the
Commandments, Love God above al, and thie neighbor as thie self, are
contrary to the Decaloge, because theie are the Epitome of that also.
Occasions may fall out that we may be brief, and upon occasion we may use mo
words as errors be suppressed, or do spring up. And it is to be wished, that as
new errors peep out, so from time to time new Articles by authority were
published, thereby to make it evident unto the whole world both how hurtful
theie be to the Church of Christ, and how we condemn them.

Now, as the Papists cannot in truth say, that we dissent from the godly
Christians living in other parts of the world: so may theie not tell us so
odiouslie of division among our selves at home. For we, al of us, allow her
Majesty's authority in causes Eccles. and civil; we, al of us, either simply
subscribe unto the form of pub. prayer prescribed, or humbly (which liberty
the law gives) desire resolution in some few things; we, al of us, jointly
both embrace the Articles of the English Creed, and renounce al haeretical
opinions contrary there-unto; we, al of us acknowledge the good things that we
do enioie, and that the Church would flourish much better, if that good laws
already made were faithfulie put in execution, and the true discipline of
Christ so greatly, and so long wished Book of Common prayer Tit. C^^^^^ation.
, were firmly established, who does not acknowledge? A thing evident enough
these many years, but never so apparent as by this great, and late trial of
the Ministers. So that this is another benefit redounding to us thereby.

Another is, that whereas the Papists would make their favorers to believe
(who theie think will credit al things whatsoever they do write) that the far
greater part of al degrees in this land are Catholics Answer to the Execut.
of Justice c. 8.* p. 171.
: and an infinite number of al states never consented unto those things which
we do Ibi. c. ^, ^. 200.
: yea, and that all the Clergy in a manner be on their sides Ibi in the preface.
, who is either so blind, that he sees not; or so ignorant, that he knows
not, how a greater untruth could never have bine published? And in this
respect we may term it an happy trial, that even all the Papists may learn
how to credit them in things not so apparent, when they will not blush to
giue-out which in their conscience they know is untrue. For, God be thanked,
not the lesser part, but even all the Ecclesiastical persons of the Church,
especialie which have* bine tried, are on our side, and not on the Papists, or
else they dissemble so cursedly as no true Christian would to gain the whole
world. And as all the realm may see, and must confess thus much: so her
Majesty, and the right honorable of her privy Counsel, do best know, and we
may easily conjecture, that the noble and worshipful of this Realm, chiefelie
the greater and better part, have devoutly sworn, and be ready, and that by
sword stoutly to defend not Popery, as some seditious fellows blow abroad
Answer to the Execut. of Justice c. 3, p. 48.
, but the Religion publicly into this land by authority received; and our
most noble princess and Queen Elizabeth, not that odious and most infamous
Pontifex. And such as the Pastors are, such be the flocks; as the Nobles be*
such are the Commons; and as the ruler of the city is himself, such are al
theie that dwell therein.

Again, although our common enemy Satan (which accuses us not only before
man but also even before the throne of the Almighty, and that day and night
(...)* (...) (...).
,) so much as in him was, labored to sow the poisoned seeds of mortal strife
and dissension among us: I trust he shall be deceived of his expectation, and
that which he made an occasion of discord, will be turned into a cause of an
holy and indissoluble concord. For holding her Majesty immediately after
Christ in her dominions over al persons the chief governor; the ordinary
service for a religious worship of God; the Articles of our religion for the
very grounds of Christianity, where-upon we must build or perish, what shall
deter us from loving one another with a most firm and Christian love? Shall
petty and trifling things of no weight, or of small importance? yea, or any
thing else that can be conceived in heart, or expressed by mouth or pen? God
forbid. And in this holy unity we shall the more firmly be rooted, do we
turn our eyes from beholding one another, and consider the unquenchable malice
of our capital enemies against us, and the cause of the same. From the
abundance of their malice, they call the holy Ministers of Christ raskals
Answer to the Execut. of Justice c. 3, p. 44.
Intruders, Philistims, Wolves, Apostataes, as before was noted. And these
infamous, yea blasphemous titles, theie attribute not unto a few, but unto al,
even from the poorest, and most obscure Curate in the country, to the highest
Praelate in the Palace. Now if thus they think, and write of us in the time
of their trial, what will theie not term us, if theie should have their wills?
And theie which have so little respect of persons, and of gifts now, will have
much less then. And the cause is neither for the Service which we have in our
Temples, which diverse Popes have offered to tolerate even as it now is
without alteration (theie would never so do, we must think, were it either
Schismatical, haeretical, or abominable, as our English of all the vainest
Papists do say) nor for the diversity of our ceremonies, it is for our
Faith, which is contrary to theirs, and for their Supremacy, which we deny:
yea, theie can bear al, themselves do say Answer to the Execut. of Justice c.
7, p. 155.
, and turn all to good, so long as the true Faith, and substance of
Ecclesiastical jurisdiction be not destroyed: but seeing we have and do both
oppugn the faith, and overthrow the government of the Church of Rome,
therefore the vilest words that Satan, their spiritual father, can put into
their hearts, be in most poisonful manner vomited forth to hurt us.

This being so, how ought we to love and make of one another, who are thus
hated, and by reuilings persecuted, and that for one and the same cause at this
present. If that day which theie so long-for should, as either that or some
other affliction in this world for our unthankfulness, or a more intolerable
at the general judgment, which is near at hand, shall come, it will not be to
our grief that we have believed, preached, and professed the truth which the
Church of England at this day does hold, but that we have not lived
there-after, we shall repent; and publishing the Gospel of peace, have yet bine
contentious, we shall repent; and being servants to one and the same Lord and
master, have not only railed upon, but also beaten and pursued one another, we
shall repent; and, being watchmen, have not bine more vigilant and resident in
our places, we shall repent; our negligence, our coldness, we shall repent; and
if we have either kept-out of the Lord his vineyard, such as both for ability
could, and for their zeal would, either implant this faith in the ignorant, or
confirm it in the learned; or to the certain destruction of themselves, and
many others depending upon them, either brought or kept in the idle, and idol
shepherd, that shall we repent also, and that with tears.

These things that we may carefulie think upon, and perform every of us in
our place, the God of peace grant us for his Christ sake, to whom together
with the holy Ghost be ascribed al honor, and praise, and glory for all the
good things both praesentlie imparted upon us, and in the life to come
praepared for us, for evermore, Amen. At London the 6. of February, Anno 1585.

In Christ yours Tho. Rogers.

was aeternal, and without beginning. The Marcionites, who said God made not
the world. For it was too base a thing for him to create. The Manechies, which
ascribed the creation of al things unto two Gods, or Beginnings, or Natures,
The One Good; where-of ca^^ good things. The Other Evil; where-of came evil
things.

2. The providence of God; as The Stoikes, who ascribe al things to Fate, or
Destiny. The Epicures, which think how God is idle, and governs not the
world.

which do
Say, there is one God, and not three persons in the God head, as do the
Jews. Turks.
Say, there be more God than one, and yet not three persons, nor of one nature,
but of contrary disposition, as the Gnostikes, Marcionites. Valentinians.
Think, there be three Gods, or spirits, not distinguished only, but divided
also, as the Tritheites. Hold, that not a Trinity, but a Quaternitie is to be
worshipped, as the Emperor Anastasius commanded. Grant The name of three
sondrie persons, and deny their persons, as did the These did say how the
same God was called in the holy Scripture by diverse names. And therefore that
the Father became flesh, and suffered, because one and the same God is called
the Father, Son, and holy Ghost. For this cause they were called
Patripassians. In this number was Seruetus.
Noetians, Praxeneans, Termogenians.
The names, and persons of three: and yet do deprive not only the Son, and
holy Ghost of their Divinity, but the whole Trinity of their properties. For
they said there be three in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy
Ghost: but the Father only is very God; the Word is the breath of the
Father, and the holy Ghost is the Spirit created by God of nothing through the
Word. And so they spoil the Son and the holy Ghost of their Deity; and
the whole Trinity of their properties. These were the Arian and Macedonian
heretics, who were called Pneumatomachoie, because they warred against the
holy Ghost:



2. ARTICLE. Of the word, or son of God, which was made very man.
THe Son, which is the1 Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the
Father, the very and eternal God, of one substance with the Father, 2 took
man's nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: so that 3
two whole and perfect natures, that is to say, the Godhead and manhood were
joined in one person, never to be divided, whereof is one Christ, very God and
very man; 4 who suffered, was crucified, dead and buried to reconcile his
Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original gilte, but also for all actual sins of men.

The Propositions.
1. Christ is very God. 2. Christ is very man. 3. Christ is God and man and
that in one person. 4. Christ is the Savior of the world.
1 That Christ is very God with us also
1. The Scriptures do witness. As it is apparent that he is The Word, Ioh. 1.
1. Begotten of the Father from everlasting* Psalm. 2, 7. Act. 13. 33 Heb. 1, 5.
Heb. 5, 5.
Very God Ioh. 17. 3. John. 8, 42. Mat. 1. 23.
God eternal, Heb. 5, 5. Of one substance with the Father, Heb. 1, 3.
2. The Creed Do testify.
Apostolical Nicene Athanasian
3. The confessio^s of the churches in Do acknowledge.

Bohem. cap. 4. 6. Ausburgh. art. 6. France art. 13. 14. Fland. art. 10.

deny the divinity of our Savior Christ.
As did Arius. Corinthus. Ebion. Eunomius. P. Samosatenus.
As do The Jews. The Turks. which say that Christ was A good man. Not God.




2. Holding the humanity of Christ, we do agree
1. with the scripture, which entreats of Christ his Conception Genesis 49, 10.
Isa. 7, 14. Mat. 1, 18, etc. Luke 1, 26, etc.
Growing, Luke 2, 40. Hungering, Mat. 4, 2. Thirsting, John. 4, 7, 19, 28.

Basil. art. 4. Bohem. cap. 6. Fland. art. 18. France. art. 14. Ausburgh. art.
3. Wittemb. cap. 2. Sueuia. art. 2. Therefore most wicked was the opinion of
those men, which said
That Christ had a body without a soul, as Eunomius the heretic did. That
Christ had a soul without sense and reason, as Apollinaris did. That Christ
took not flesh of the Virgin Marie, as did the Valentinians. Arians.
do the Anabaptists. Fam. of Love.

That Christ took flesh not of the Virgin only, but by the seed of man too,
as Ebion gave out.


3. That the divine and humane nature of Christ is united in one person,
accords
1. With the Scripture. John 1, 14. etc. Math. 3, 17. Ephesians. 4, 10. Phil. 2, 5.
etc. 1 Timothy 2, 5.
2. With the Creed Apostolical. Nicen, Athanasian.

Basil. art. 4. Bohem. art. 6. France. art. 15. Fland. art. 19. Ausburgh art.
3. Wittemb. cap. 2. Sueuia. art. 2. Therefore detestable is the error
Of Eutiches and Dioscorus, who thought the two natures of Christ were so
confounded, that the nature of the Word, and of the Flesh was one, and the
same. Of Nestorius, who denied the two natures of Christ to be united, that the
properties of the one, might in some sense be ascribed unto the other: and
said that as Christ had two natures, so he had not one but two persons. Of
Seruetus, who said of Christ, that he was the Patren of al things, and but a
figure of the son of God and that the body of Christ, was compact of three
uncreated elements: and so confounded and overthrew both natures.


4. That Christ is the Savior of the world, agrees.
1. With the Scripture, which testifies that Christ truly Suffered, was
crucified, Died, was buried, Matthew 27, 26, etc. And that
1. To reconcile his Father unto us, Romans 5. 10. 2 Cor. 5. 18, etc. Ephesians. 2,
16. Col. 1, 19, 20.
2. To be a sacrifice, etc. for all sins of men. Isa 53, 4. John. 1, 19. Gal.
3, 13. 2. Cor. 5, 21. 1. John. 2, 2.

Ausburg. art. 3. Saxon. art. 3. Wittemb. cap. 2. Sueuia, art. 2. Then wicked
are al opinions contrary hereunto, which tend
To show that Did suffer, a^ that of the Patripassians
The Father in his Deity Not the Son in his humanity
To show that Christ did not truly suffer, but in imagination, as the
Heretics Cerdon, and Basilicus cast-forth. To bring the passion of our Lord
into detestation, as do the fantasies of the wicked Iacobites and Turks. To
make the passion of Christ Of none effect, To put away but Original sin
only. As that of
Popish Masses. Popish prayers. Popish pardons. Popish Purgatory.

To show that Christ died not for the sins of al men. To show that some
sins be so filthy, as Christ his blood upon true repentance cannot wash
them away.


3. ARTICLE. Of the going down of Christ into hell.
AS Christ died for us, and was buried: so also it is to be believed that he
went down into hell,

That our Savior Christ descended into Hell, together without Church
1. The ancient creeds 1. Apostolical 2. Athanasian
2. The confessions of the Churches of Heluet. 2, cap. 11. Basil. art. 4.
Ausburgh art. 3. Sueuia, art. 2. Do testify. Which word Hell, in this
article, as we take it, signifies
Not the place of everlasting torments where Dives was, and is; Luke 16, 23. All the reprobate together shall be: Matthew. 25, 41. In which place Christ, as man,
was not, forasmuch as
1. His body lay in the grave, Matthew. 12. 40. Matthew. 16, 4. Luke 11, 29.
2. His soul was Commended into the hands of God the Father, Psalm 31, 5. Luke
23. 46
In Paradise: (so is it set down as a thing well to be observed) and not in
Hell, Luke 23, 43.


The terrors, and torments of the body, and soul, which Christ suffered, as
appears, Isa, 53, 6. Isa. 53. 10. Psalm. 116. 3, Matthew. 26, 38. Matthew. 27, 46,
Luke 22, 42. And so we are against them.
1. Which say, that Christ descended not into Hell at al. 2. Which think that
Christ descended into the place of torments, where in soul he endured for a
time the pains which the damned spirits do there sustain. 3. Which hold,
that Christ went down into Lake ^ymbo, to fetch from thence, as Canisius: to
loose from thence, as Vaux he says, the souls of our forefathers, which before
his death were shut up in the close prison of Hell.




4. ARTICLE. Of the Resurrection of Christ.
CHrist did truly 1 arise again from death, and took again his body, with
flesh, bones, and al things appertaining to the perfection of man's nature; 2
wherewith he ascended into heaven, and there sits, 3 until he return to
judge al men at the last day.

The Propositions*
1. Christ is risen from death. 2. Christ is ascended into heaven. 3. Christ
will come again to judge the quick, and the dead.
1. The resurrection of Christ is
1. Proved by the Scriptures. For it is evident that Christ Should arise, In
the old Testament, Psalm. 16, 12. Isa. 53, 10.
In the New Testament, by the testimony of our Savior Christ, Matthew. 12, 40*
Mark 9, 31. Mark 10, 34. Luke 9, 22.

Did rise again* By his appearing to Marie Magdalene, John 20, 14, etc. Diverse
women, Matthew. 2^, 9. Two Disciples in the field, Luke, 24, 13. Ten Disciples,
John 20, 19. etc. All the Disciples, John 20, 26. More than 500. brethren at
once, 1. Cor. 15, 6. To sundry, 40. days together, Act. 1, 3.
By the testimony of Peter, Act. 1, 22. Act. 2, 31. 1. Pet. 1, 3.
Paul. Act. 17, 3. Romans 10, 9. 1. Cor. 15, 4, etc.



2. Affirmed by 1. The Creed Apostolical, Nicen, Athanasian.
2. The Confession of the churches in Heluet. 1. art. 11. 2, cap. 11,
Basil. art. 4. Bohem. cap. 6. France, art. 15, 16. Ausburgh. art. 3. Sueuia,
art. 2. So that utterly false, and unchristian is the opinion of
The Sadduc^is, which flatly deny the resurrection of any. The Jews, that
will not acknowledge this resurrect. of Christ. The Schuenkfeldians, that sa^e,
how our Savior after his resurrection was so deified, that he retained no
more the properties of his body and soul, nor the union of both natures, but
was meerelie God. The Fam. of Love, which take the resurrection of Christ to be
but an allegory, and no certain history.



2. In saying how christ with his very body ascended into heaven, we declare
our selves to dissent not
1. From the scriptures Psalm. 47, 5. Psalm. 68, 18. Psalm. 110, 1. Math. 22, 44.
Math. 26, 64. Act. 1, 9. Luke. 24, 51. Romans 8, 34. Ephesians. 4, 8, 9, 10.
2. From the Creed Apostolical, Nicen, Athanasian.
3. From the Confess. of the Churches of Helue. 1. art. 11. 2. cap. 11.
Basil. art. 4. Bohem. cap. 6. France, art. 15. Fland. art. 20. Ausburgh. art,
3. Saxon. art 3. Sueuia. art. 2. But we altogether dissent
1. From the Vbiquitaries, as Papists Certain Germans Which do hold that
the body of Christ is
Not only in heaven, But also in earth, and that every where Where the
Sacrament is (...).
In every kingdom, In every Country, In every city, In every parish, In
every loase, In every piece of bread, and cup of wine.


2. From the Papists that say how Christ ascended carrying with him the souls
which he losed from captivity, and bondage of the Devil, whereas there is not
one word, either 1. In the S. Scripture. 2. In any sound Confession. Old New
That the souls of the righteous
Were not before (...) Were then placed (...)





^. Where we say that Christ shall come again to judge al men we agree
1. With the scripture. Acts. 10, 42. Romans 2, 16. 2. Tim. 4, 1, 8. Iam. 5, 9.
2. With the Creed Apostolical* Nicen* Athanasian.
3. With the Confess. of the Churches in Helue. 2. cap. 11. 1. art. 11.
Basil. art. 9. Bohem. cap. 6. Fland. art 37. Ausburgh. art. 3. Sueuia, art. 2.
But we renounce their opinions which think
That there shall be no judgment at al, as the Atheists, and Epicures of this
world, do. That The Devils The wicked shall be saved, as do the Origenists. That
before the judgment there shall be a golden world, the godly and none besides
enjoying the same peaceably and gloriously, as the Jews do. That the
righteous are in godly glory, and shall from henceforth live everlastingly with
Christ, and reign upon earth, as the Fam. of Love teaches.


5. ARTICLE. Of the holy Ghost.
THe holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father, and the Son, is of one
substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father, and the Son, very and
eternal God.

This article concerning the holy ghost
1. The Scripture, Math. 28, 19. Act. 2, 4. 2. Cor. 13, ^3. 2. Pet. 1, 21. 1.

9, 11. Wittemb. cap. 1. 3. Sueuia, art. 1. Do verify. In saying
That the holy Ghost proceeds from the Father, and the Son, we show our
selves not to be of the error of the Graecians, which said how the holy Ghost
proceeded from the Father, but not from the Son. That the holy Ghost is of
one substance with the Father and the Son, we declare our selves adversaries
to the Macedonian heretics, who said the holy Ghost was a Creature, which is
of another substance than GOD is. That the holy Ghost is of one substance,
majesty, and glory with the Father, and the Son, we altogether dissent from
the heresy of the Sabellians, and Tritheites, which thought the holy Ghost to
be that, which God the Father, and God the Son were, and no distinct person
from them.


6. ARTICLE. Of the sufficiency of the holy Scriptures for salvation.
Holy Scripture 1 contains al things necessary to salvation: so that
whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be
required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the faith, or
be thought requisite necessary to salvation. 2 In the name of the holy
Scripture, we do understand those Canonical books of the old and new
Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.

Of the names and number of the Canonical books.
Genesis. Exodus. Leuiticus. Devteronomium. Iosue. Judges. Ruth. The 1. book
of Samuel. The 2. book of Samuel. The 1. book of Kings. The 2. book of
Kings. The 1. book of Chron. The 2. book of Chron. The 1. book of Esdras.
The 2. book of Esdras. The book of Esther. The book of Job. The Psalms. The
Proverbs. Eccles. or the Preacher. Cant. or song of Solomon. 4. Prophets the
greater. 12. Prophets the less.
3 And the other books (as Hierome says) the Church does read for example of
life, and instruction of manners: but yet does it not apply them to stablish
any doctrine. Such are these following.

The third book of Esdras. The fourth book of Esdras. The book of Tobias.
The book of Judith. The rest of the book of Hester. The book of wisdom.
Jesus the son of Sirach. Baruch the Prophet. Song of the three children. The
story of Susanna. Of Bell, and the Dragon. The prayer of Manasses. The 1. book
of Machab. The 2. book of Machab.
4 All the books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we do
receive, and account for Canonical.

The Propositions.
1. The S. Scripture contains al things necessary unto the salvation of
man. 2. All the books in the volume of the Bible, are not Canonical. 3. The 3.
and 4. books of Esdras: the book of Tobias, etc. are Apocripha. 4. In the
new testament, all the books are Canonical.
1 That the Scriptures of God are al sufficient and necessary to instruct us
unto ^^luation, with us,
1 The S. Scripture, Deuteronomy. 4, 2. 12, 8.
Josh. 1, 7. Prou. 30, 5. John. 20, 31. Gal. 1, 8. 2. Tim. 3, 16. Revel. 22,
18. 19.
2. The confess. of the Churches of God in Heluet 1. art. 1, 4. 2. cap. ^.
Basil. art. 10. Bohem. cap. 1. France, art. 2, 4, 5. Fland. art. 5, 7. Saxon.
art* 1. Wittemb. cap. 30. Sueuia, art. 1. Do witness. And therefore we are
adversaries to al such as before the word of God, do prefer their, own
Inventions, as the Philosophers: whereof one said of Moses. That good man
makes a trim discourse, but he proves nothing. Fantastical imaginations, a^
Did the Manechies. Do the Libertines, Anabaptists, Fam of Love.

Traditions, as the Papists, which evidently appears in that they do most
cruelie punish, and torment such as refuse The wicked precepts of men; or not
at al, or ouerslightly correct the breakers of God his commandments.
To keep popish holy days. To hear their blasphemous Mass, To observe
their superstitious fastings and ceremonies,
Statutes, or edicts, or decrees, or judgments, or proclamations, or else
whatsoever proceeding from the brain of man, as Macchiauel does, and his
favorers.


2. That some books in the Bible are Canonical, and some Apocrypha, it has
been granted by the best learned, and most godly of long time. And as all the
reformed Churches in the world are of the same judgment with us: so in their
public confessions some have so compted, and judged of them as we do. As
namely the Church in
France, art. 3. Fland* art, 4. Therefore (to speak first of the Canonical
books of the old Testament) they have hainously offended, and defaced the
glory of God, which
1. Rejected all the books of the old^ Testament, as did the Heretics
Basilides, Ca^po^rates, the Manichies.
2. Allowed some, but not all the Canonical books of the old Testament. And of
this sort Some received no more but the. 5. books of Moses, as the Saduceis.
Some received the Law only, and the Prophets* as the Samarites. Some
received neither the law nor the Prophets: as the Appelleans.


3. That diverse, yea and those books here mentioned are Apocrypha, we are
neither the first that said it, nor they only which affirm the same. For
The ancient Council at Laodicea, can. 59. did The confessions of the Churches
reformed in Do
France, art. 3. Fland, art. 4. Judge them, not to be Canonical. So that they
are to be taken heed of as seducers, which would thrust upon the Church,
1. The books for canonical Apocrypha, within the volume of the Bible, as the
Papists would: and therefore accursse so many as take them not for canonical,
Conc. Trid, sess, 4. decr. de can. Scrip. 2. Any books not comprehended in
the Bible, whether they be The new Prophets, Barcobas, and Barcolf, of
Basilides the heretic. The Phaneroses, or manifestations of Marcion the
heretic. The mysteries of Manechie the Heretic. Isais Ascensorium, of
Hierax the Heretic. The Gospel after The Egyptians. The Hebrews. The 12.
Apostles. Barnabas. Thomas. Nicodemus.
The Acts of S. Paul. The Revel. of S. Peter. The books of the Montanistes*
Anabaptists* HN. Papists, and^.




4 Although some of the ancient Doctors accepted not all the books
comprehended within the volume of the new testament for Canonical: yet in the
end they were wholly taken and received by the common consent of the Church of
Christ in this world, for the very word of God, as they are at this day in all
places, where the Gospel is preached and professed* Howbeit we judge them
canonical
Not so much because man in the world does so receive and allow of them. As for
that 1 The holy spirit in our hearts, does testify that they are from God. 2
They carry a sacred authority with the^. 3 They do agree with the other books
of God in the old Testament. Therefore in receiving the^ wholly, not in part, we
show our selves utterly to condemn
Such as received not the whole new^ Testament but* a part thereof. And these
were of diverse kinds, whereof Some rejected all the Epistles of Paul* etc.
and allowed only the Gospel after Mathewe, as Corinthus the Heretic. Some
received of the As Marcionth^ Heretic.
Evangelists only Luke, Epistles of Paul only the Epistle unto Timothy and
Titus.
Some allowed of all the testament, only the Act^ of the Apostles, as Tatian the
Heretic.
Such as allowed neither the whole new Testament, nor those books wholly which
they received, as the Marcionites, who defaced al those places in the Gospel
after Luke, and in the Epistles which concerned either the Divinity, or
humanity of our S. Christ. Such as receive and read the new Testament, but
scrape out such text^ therein, as mislike them, as the Turks, who scrape out
whatsoever they find touching the passion of Christ, saying how it was added
purposely by the Jews, in derision of the Christians.


7. ARTICLE* Of the old Testament.
THe 1 old Testament is not contrary to the new, for both in the old and new
Testament everlasting life is offered to mankind by Christ, who is the only
mediator between God and man, being both God and man. 2Wherefore they are not
to be heard, which feign that the old Fathers did look only for transitory
promises. 3 Although the Law given from God by Moses, as tuching ceremonies
and rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the civil precepts thereof ought of
necessity to be received in any Common wealth, yet notwithstanding, no
Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the Commandments,
which are called moral.

The Propositions.
1 The old Testament is not contrary unto the new. 2 The old Fathers looked
for eternal happiness, so well as for temporal blessings. 3 The Law moral
remains, though the ceremonial and civil be abrogate.
1 That the old Testament is not contrary to the new, it may easily be proved
by many invincible arguments yet is it most apparent in that our Christ (very
God, and very man, as above, p. 6* 7. has been declared) is offered unto
mankind by them both. That
1 There is one Christ, and no moc, 2. Christ is the Son of God, 3. Christ is
very man, 4. Christ was born at Bethlehem, 5. Christ was* born of a virgin,
6. Christ was honored of wi^e men, 7. Christ rid upon an Ass unto lerusalem,
8. Christ was betrayed, 9. Christ did suffer not for his own but for our sins,
10. Christ did rise again, 11. Christ did ascend, As 'it is apparent in the
new Testament.

16, 10. Ion. 2, 1. 11. Psalm. 68, 8. So that we are adversaries to their
doctrine, and they, as it should seem, enemies to this which
Utterly reject the old Testament, as did the Heretics. Basilides.
Carpocra^es. Manichies.
Say that the Law as contrary to the Gospel, is not to be preached, as do the
Antiomies, and Anabaptists.



2 That the old Fathers looked not only for transitory promises, but for
eternal happiness beside

fathers hoped for temporal, and not for spiritual and eternal happiness, as
Many of the Jews did. The Fa of Love, as it should seem, does.


3. That the Law
1. Ceremonial is not necessarily to be observed of al men, and in all times.

force.
It still is, as do the Jews. Turks. Cerdonits Armenians.
It shall be a thousand years together, after the general resurrection, as do
the Apollinareans, and Millenaries.

condemned.

9. ARTICLE. Of original, or birth sin.
ORiginal 1 2 sin stands not in the following of Adam (as the Pelagians do
vanelie talk) but it is the fault and corruption of the nature of every man,
that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam, wherebie man is very
far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to
evil, so that the flesh lusts always against the spirit, and therefore in
every person borne into this world, it deserves Gods wrath, and damnation. 3
And this infection of nature does remain, yea in them that are regenerated,
whereby the lust of the flesh, called in Greek (...), which some do expound
the wisdom, some sensuality, some the affection, some the desire of the
flesh, is not subject to the law of God. 4 And although there is no
condemnation for them that believe, and are baptized: yet The Apostle does
confess, that concupiscence and lust has of itself the nature of sin.

The Propositions.
1. There is original sin. 2 What original sin is. 3 Original sin
remaneth in God his children. 4 Concupiscence even in the regenerate is sin.
1. Though this word original sin is not to be found in the Can. Scripture,
yet that there is Orig. sin, it is clear
1. By the S. Scripture, wherein is set down most evidently, thereof 1. The
cause which is 1. Principalie the fall of Adam* as Romans 5. 15 etc. 1. Cor. 15.
22. Who fell partly
By the suggestion of the Devil Cor. 11. 3. Genesis 3. 4.
Through his own free will.

2. Secondarily the propagation of the corrupted nature fro man unto man. So
says Christ* John 3, 3, and 6, ^3. Paul. Romans 5. 12, 1. Cor. 15, 48. Peter. 2.
Pet. 2. James, cap. 1. ^8. John, 1. Epist. 3, 4, 5.

2. The subject even the old man, with all his powers, mind, will, and heart.
For in the 1. Mind there is Darkness. Ignorance Of God and his will
Matthew. 12. 34. Rom 8, 7. Rom 3, 4. 1. Cor. 2, 14. 2. Tim. 3, 8. 1. John 3 1.
1. John 5, 20.

2. Will and heart there is Concupiscence Rebellious motions For so it is
Matthew. 5, 19. Act. 7. 39. Act. 15, 9. Romans 1, 21. Iam. 1, 13.


3. The effects, which are 1. Not only actual sins, and they both Math. 15. 19.
1. Inward, as ungodly Affections Cogitations
2. Outward, as Wicked looks, Profane speech, Devilish actions.

2. But also 1. An evil conscience, 1. John, 3. 21. 2. The wrath of God Romans 1,
18. Col. 3, ver. 5. 6. 3. Death, John 8, 24. Romans 5, 12. Iam. 1, 15. 4. Eternal
damnation. Romans 5, 18.


2. By the Confession of the Churches of God in Heluet. confess. 1. Art. 8. 2.
Cap. 8.
Basil. art. 2. Bohem. cap. 4. France, art. 9. 11. Fland. art. 15. Ausburgh,
art. 2. Saxon. art. 2. And thus armed both with the word of God, and the
confessio^s of the purest Churches we do offer battle
Both to the Carpocratians and such like, who utterly deny that there is any
original sin. And also Not only to Florinus and Blastus, etc. who make God
the Auctor of sin; But also to al such as curiously enquire whether God
would have Ada^ to fall; or why he stayed him not from offending



2. Original sin ^^
Not the imitation of Adam his wickedness. For neither does The Scripture
speak thereof Any Church reformed or otherwise, so think: and some flatly by
public confession with us deny it, as the Church in France, art. 10. in
Fland. art. 15.
Partly 1. The Imputation of Adam his disobedience unto us. So says 1. The
Scripture. Romans 5. verse 12. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19.
2. The Churches of god at Ausburgh, art. 2. Saxon. art. 2. Wittemb. cap. 4.

2. The fault and corruption of the nature of every man. As we find in the 1.
Scripture Romans 5. 12. Romans 3, 23. Romans 7, 18. 1. Cor. 15. 48. Ephe. 2, 3.
2. Confessions of the Churches in Helue. lat. ca. 8. France, art. 10. Bohem.
cap. 4. Ausburg. art. 2. Saxon. art. 2. Wittemb. ca. 4. Our Savior Christonly
exempted from the taint of this corruption. For
He is the immaculate Lamb, 1. Pet. 1. 19. He did no sin, 1. Pet. 2. 22. He
knew no sin, 2. Cor. 5* 21. He was tempted, and yet without sin, Hebr. 4,
15. Now adversaries hereunto, are the
Who say that Orig. sin comes by imitation and not otherwise.
1. Pelagians 2. Fam. of Love.
3. Valentinians who ascribed Orig* sin Not in any sort unto man. To the
Devil.
4. Manichies, who hold that this sin Proceeds not from our corrupted
nature. Is another substance within us.
5. Papists, who though they grant that the virgin Marie was naturally
engendered of the offspring of Adam: yet they deny that she was guilty of
original sin, Conc. Trid. decr. de pec. Orig.





3. That Original sin remaneth, yea in them that be regenerate, it is
1. Easy to be proved by the scripture, as in diverse places beside: so
apparently Romans 7, 14* etc. Gal. 5, 16. Iam. 1, 14. Iam. 4, 1. ^. Pet. 2, 11.
2. Agreeable to the Confessions of other reformed Churches, Confess. Heluet. 1.
art. 8. 2. cap. 8
Basil. art, 2. France, art. 11. Saxon. art. 10. Therefore we do stand in this
point against
1. The Papists, who say that Orig. sin was not at al, much less remaned in
the Virgin Ma^^e, whence it follows, if Orig. sin were not in her, then
(...) was not regenerate; if not regenerate, a very dangerous, and most
unchristian doctrine does ensue concerning her. 2. The Fam. of Love, who
affi^me that the elect and regenerate sin not. For seeing Orig. sin is in
the regenerate, as the Scripture does testify, then do, and shall the
regenerate sin, so long as they have within them Orig. sin. 3. Adamites,
that contend how they are in so good a state, as Adam was before his fall:
therefore without Orig. sin.


4. That Concupiscence in all men (and therefore in the faithful and regenerate)
is sin, is very apparent.
1. In the Scripture, because 1. The holy Spirit straightly forbids it
Coloss. 3, 5. 1. Pet. 2. 11.
It 2. Not only lusts against the Spirit. Gal. 5, 17. 3. But also fights
against The soul, 1. Pet. 2, 11. The law of the mind, Romans 7, 24.

4. It brings certainly (but that there is no condemnation to them which are
in Christ Jesus, Romans 8, 1.) death, and damnation. Gal. 5, verse 17. and 21.
Iam. 1. 14, 15.
2. In the right Christian Confession Heluet. 2, cap. 9. Saxon. art. 2. 10.
Therefore we mislike their opinions, as unsound which say that concupiscence is
no sin, but
1. A thing indifferent, and the punishment of sin, as do the Pelagians.
Sententiaries.
2. Proceeding from sin, and inclining unto sin; so do the Papists. Conc.
Trid. Sess. 5. decr. depec. Orig.


10. ARTICLE. Of free will.
THe 1 condition of man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turn
and prepare himself by his own natural strength and good works ^re faith and
calling upon God. Wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant and
acceptable to God, 3 without the grace of God by Christ preventing us, that we
may have a good will, and woorking with us, when we have that good will.

The Propositions.
1. Man may do outward and evil things, being not yet regenerate. 2. Man
cannot do what good is, being not yet regenerate. 3. Man may perform good
things, when he is prevented by the grace of Christ, and renewed by the holy
Ghost.
1. We deny not that men, not yet regenerate, have free will to do the works
1. Of nature, for the preservation, or destruction of the 1* Body, 2. Bodily
state, Which thing the very
1. Brute beasts 2. Profane Gentiles Had, and have, As it is well observed in

2. Of Satan, both in 1. Thinking, 2. Willing, 3. Doing. That which il is. So
witnesses
1. The S. Scripture Genesis 6, 5. Genesis 8, 11.
2. The godly by the confession Heluet. 2, cap. 9. Heluet. 1, art. 9. Bohem.
cap. A false opinion is it therefore, that man has no power to move
1. His body unto outward things. 2. His mind unto wickedness, as the
Manichies do hold




2. We deny, that man before he be regenerate can turn, and prepare himself
by his own natural strength and good works to faith, and calling upon God,
that is, we deny that man has power of him self
What good is.
1. To understand 2. To will,
3. To do any thing that pleases God, So it is
1. In the Scripture, Rome. 8, 7. 2. Cor. 3, 5. 1. Cor. 2, 14. 1. Cor. 12, 3.
John 15, 5.
2. In the Confess. of the godly at Heluet. 1. art. 9. 2. cap. 9.
Basil. art. 2. Bohem. cap. 4. Ausburgh. art. 18. Flan. art. 14. Adversaries
unto the truth are the
Which hold, that naturally there is free will in men, and that unto goodness.
Pharisees Sadduces* Pelagians Papists,
Donatistes, that say, how man is borne with free will, and if he will, he
believes in Christ; if he will not, he believes not: if he will, he continues
in that which he believes, if he will not, he continues not.



3. In a man prevented by the grace of Christ, and regenerate by the S. Spirit,
1. The understanding is enlightened, so that he knows The secrets The will Of
god. So testify
1. The scriptures Iere. 31, 33. Matthew. 11, 27. Matthew. 16, 17. Luke. 10. v. 21,
22. 1. Cor. 2, 12. 1 Cor. 12, 3, etc.
2. The godly in all places,

2. The very will is 1. Not only changed. Acts. 15, 9. Phil. 2, 13. 1. Cor. 6,
10, 11.
2. But also endued with power to do good things. As witness 1. The
scriptures* Acts. 15, 9. Romans 8, 26. Phil. 1, 29. Phil. 2, 13.
The godly in their confess. Heluet. 2, cap. 9. Ausburgh art. 18. Bohem. cap.

Not only passiuelie, but also actiuelie, Yet not perfectly, but imperfectly.
1. Cor. 13. 9, and 12. Romans 7. 22, etc. Gal. 5, 17. So we declare our selves
enemies to the doctrine of the
Anomaeans, for that cause by-named Atheons, who say theie know the invisible
God* not in part, but thoroughlie; not by faith, but perfectly; as any man
knows any visible thing. Which either say, they are pure from al spots of
sin: or that the regenerate do not sin at al.

1. ARTICLE. Of the justification of man.
WE are accounted righteous before God, only for the 1 merit of our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ 2 by faith, and not for 3 our own works or deseruings.
Wherefore, that we are justified by Faith only is a most wholesome doctrine,
and verieful of comfort, etc.

The Propositions.
We are accounted righteous before God
Only 1. For the merit of our L. and Savior Christ. 2. By Faith.
3. Not for our own Works. Deseruings.


1. That through the merits of our L. Jesus Christ we are accounted righteous
before God, it is evident
1. In the Scripture; where we find, that by Christ His blood we are cleansed
1. John, 1. 17. 1. Pet. 1, 18. 1. Cor. 6, 20. John 1, 29. Romans 3. 25.
His righteousness, we are justified Phil. 5, 8. etc. Romans 5, 19. 1. Cor. 1. 30.
2. Cor. 5, 21. Romans 10, 4. etc.

2. In the Confessions of the godly militant in this world, as may be seen in
the Confess. of the Church in Heluet. 2, cap. 15. Bohem. cap. 6. France, art.
12. Fland. art. 22. Ausburgh. art. 4. Wittemb. art. 5. Sueuia, cap. 3. But so
believe not
The Atheists of this world, for they are not persuaded of the life to come,
not of the mysteries of man's salvation. The Pharisaical teachers, who think
there is no righteousness before God, but civil and external righteousness in the
sight of men. The Papists. For they teach that Some sins are washed away,
not by the blood of Christ, but by holy water, so called, as lesser offenses.
Some sins are purged By the fire of Purgatory. By alms giving. By
Perigrinations. By Pardons. By Masses. By fasting, etc.




2. The doctrine of our justification by Faith only, as it is whole some, and full
of comfort* so is it
1. Grounded upon the word of God, as Mark. 5, 36 Act. 10. 41, etc. Act. 13.
^8. Act. 15, 8. Act. 22, 16 Romans 1, 16. Romans 3, 20, etc. Romans 4, 4, etc. Romans
10. 3, etc. Gal. 2, 16, etc. Gal. 3, 7* etc. Ephesians. 2, 8. Phil. 3, 6* etc.
2. Subscribed unto by the godly in all the reformed Churches of this world, and
by public writing in the Confession of Hell. 2. c. 16. ^asil. art. 8. Bohe. c.
6. 7. Fran. art. 20 Flan. art. 22. Ausburgh, art. 4. Sax. art. 3, 8. Wittemb.
art. 4. Sueuia, cap. 3. Partakers of the profit and comfort of this doctrine
^re not
The Infidels, who Either be altogether ignorant of this mystery. Either know
it, but apply it not to their own souls and consciences, but altogether
despise the same As did Herod, in killing Iams, act. 12* Agrippa, in not
desending Paul Act. 26, 26 etc. The Jews in persecuting the Apostles. Act. 13,
41. etc.
As do The Devils. Iam. 2. 19. Many ungodly me^ False Christians. Tyrans.
Apostates, etc.


Either teach not a sure confidence in Christ: but an historical knowledge of
Christ, and of other Eccles. matters, as in his Catechism does Canisius. cap.
1. Vaux. Cap. 1.
Either hold that man is to be still in doubt whether he shall be saved, or no,
as the Papists, Conc. Trid. sess. 6 c. 9.
Such as do feign, that they please God, not through faith by hearing, but by
revelation, as the Manichies. Enthusiasts. Anabaptists.
They which hold that man is justified By Works without Faith. As did The
false Apostles in Asia, 1. Tim. 1. The Interim of Ausburgh.
As do the Turks: Anabaptists.
By Faith and works As did the Pseudoapostles at Jerusalem. Act. 15. As do the
Papists commonly.
Neither by faith nor works, as they which contemn both a sure confidence in
Jesus Christ, and good virtues, and yet hope to be saved, as they say.
They who defend how we apprehend not the righteousness of Christ by faith*
but have it, or Christ himself rather dwelling essentially within us, as the O
sianders.


3. Besides what has been said that works have no place, nor portion in the
matter of our justification, it is evident
1. In the holy Scripture, where we do find, that Al men be sinners, and are
destitute of the glory of God: and therefore that no man can be justified by
works Psalm. 14, 2, 3. Psalm. 53, 2, 3. Psalm. 51. 4. Romans 5, 12. etc.
The Apostles, and the whole Synod gathered together in the holy Ghost did
conclude that both Jews and Gentiles which believed were saved, not by works,
but by the mere grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, Act. 15. Eternal life comes
not by desert, but Of Promise Acts 2. 39. 3. 25. 13, 32, etc.
Rom 3, 21, etc. 2. Tim. 1, 1.
Of Gift, John. 17, 2. Romans 6, 23. 1. John. 5, 11. Revel. 2, 10*

The just shall live by faith. And the Law is not of ^^ith, Gal. 3. 11. As the
godly in old time were: so Christians in these days are* and shall be
justified. But the godly were justified not for any good works, or worthiness
of their own. So justified was Abraham Romans 4, 1. etc. Gal 3, 6. etc. Heb. 11.
17.
The Jews, Act. 2 44. The Sama^itans, Act. 8, 12. Paul, Act. 9. Act. 22, 16.
1. ti. 1. 13 etc. Ph. 3. 6. etc.
The Eunuch, act. 8, 37 The ^ailer. Act. 16. 31. etc. The Ephesians, Ephesians. 2, 4.
etc.

2. In the Confess of the godly in this world, as appears plainly Heluet. 2,
cap. 16. Basil. art. 8. Bohem. cap. 7. France, Art. 22. Fland. art. 24.
Ausburgh, art. 6. 26. Adversaries unto this truth are
The Pharisees who thought that by external righteousness They were saved.
Moral Ceremonial*
The false Apostles both In Asia, 1 Timothy 1. At Jerusalem, Act. 15.
The Pharisaical Papists, which against the justification of Faith only, do
hold a justification by Merits, and that of 1. Congruitie. 2. Dignity. 3.
Condignitie.



12. ARTICLE. Of good works.
ALbeit that good works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after
justification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of Gods
judgment: yet 1 are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, 2 and do
spring out necessarily of a true and lively faith, insomuch, that by them a
lively faith 3 may be as evidently known, as a tree discerned by the fruit.

The Propositions.
1 Good works do please God. 2. No work is good except it spring from faith.
3. Good works are the outward signs of the inward belief.
1. Though God acce^^ not man for his works ^ake, as has bin^ proved* yet that
good works after man his justification please God, it is a clear truth every
where to be seen.
1. In the Scripture, because God has Commanded them to be done, Matthew. 5.
16. John. 15. 12. Phil. 2. 14 etc. 1 These 4, 3 2. Tim. 2, 19. And requires
righteousness

5, and 6. Wittemb cap. 7. Sueuia, cap. 4. Which truth is oppugned by
adversaries of diverse kinds, whereof
Some hold, that seeing man is justified by faith, he may live as him lists
licentiously, as the Libertines. Some think that to attend upon virtue and to
follow goodness* is a yoke too intolerable, as the Simo^ia^s. Some utterly
reject al grace, virtue and feate of God, as Did the Donatistes. Ae^ians.
Circumcellians.
Do the Macchiauils. Atheists.

Some permit, though not al manner: yet some sins* So of the Whoredom, is
allowed.
Carpocratians Valentinians,
Perjury in the time of troubles, is allowed.
Basilidians, Helchisaits, Priscilhanites, Fam. of Love,
Papists. Simple fornication, yea, in Priests. is allowed. Breaking of faith to
an heretic, etc. is allowed.
Some dream that God is pleased with lipseruice, and outward righteousness, as
the hypocritical Pharisees or Pharisaical Hypocrites.


2. Al which man does, is not pleasing unto God, but that only which
proceeds from a true faith in Jesus Christ. So witnesses
1. The Scripture Heb. 11, 6. Romans 14, 23. Tit. 1, 15. Romans 8, 8. Gal. 5, 6. 1.
John 5. 4. 5 And although the works of the believing do please God: yet are
theie not so perfect, that they can satisfy the law of God Therefore even to
the justified says
Christ, Pray, etc. forgive us our debts. Matthew. 6, 12. Say we are
unprofitable servants. Luke 17, 10.
Paul, We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am carnal, etc Rom 7. 14, etc.
We which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we do sight in ourselves,
etc. and have infirmities. Romans 8, 23. Ye cannot do the same things that ye
would. Gal. 5, 17.


2. The godly in their public confessions extant in print, Heluet. 2, cap.

art. 26. Saxon. art. 3, 5, and 6. Wittemb. cap. 7. Sueuia, cap. 4. Therefore as
we mislike: so we condemn the ungod lie opinion of the
Valentinians, who say, that please God do Spiritual men, which are
themselves, not by faith, but only by knowledge. Natural men, not by faith,
but by Labor. True dealing.

Who teach, that the Laws of God may perfectile be fulfilled of men, once
justified, as the Papists; illuminated, as say the Elders in the Family.
Papists, Fam. of Love.



3. Many are the reasons why good works are to be done, cited in part before
page 42. yet not the least cause is that men may be known what they are; so
says
1. The Scripture, that thereby are known The good trees, from the bad. Matthew.
7, 16. etc. The wheat from the chafe. Matthew. 3, 12. The true Disciples, from
the false. John. 13, 35. The sons of God, from the children of Satan, Luke 6,
36. Ephesians. 5. 1. 1. John 3, 10.
The regenerate, from th'vnbeleeuing Iam. 2, 18. 1. Pet. 1, 17. etc. 1. Pet. 4,

this do the children of God.

Papists. Con. Trid. Sess. 6. can. 24.


13. ARTICLE. Of works before justification.
Works done before the grace of Christ, and the inspiration of his spirit, are
1 not pleasant to God, forasmuch as theie spring not of faith in Jesus Christ, 2
neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the school aucthors
say) deserve grace of congruitie: yea rather, 3 for that they are not done as
God has willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the
nature of sin.

The Propositions.
Works before Justification
1 Please not God. 2. Deserve not grace of congruitie. 3. Have the nature of
sin.

1. Before men do please God, nothing that man does can please him. But men
please not God being not renewed by the Spirit, which as it has been already
proved: so is it
1. In the Scripture, where it is evident, that before man be regenerate, they
are Which bring out no good fruit of them selves.
Matthew. 7, 16.
Not grapes but thorns. Not figs, but thistles.
Not good, but il trees, Matthew. 12, 33. Luke 6, 43.
Not lively, but dead bows. John 15. 4. Not ingraffed, but wild olives. Romans
11. 17. 23.
Not friends, but enemies Romans 5. 10 Not the sons of God, but the children of
wrath. Ephesians. 2, 3.
2. In the public confessions of the Churches reformed, expresselie, Heluet.
2, cap. 15. Ausburgh, art. 20. Wherebie the vanity of al them is perceived,
which think that without regeneration God is pleased with man his deeds
whether they be
Papists, Look page 39 Commenders of civil, and Philosophical righteousness, and
placers of the doers of such works, though without faith in christ in the
heavens.


2. The unregenerate, not yet justified, have nothing in them to move God to
be gracious unto them. As may be seen
1. In the Scripture, where we find that the unregenerate, being Old, not
new creatures Ephesians. 4, 22. Col. 3. 5.
Enemies, (Romans 8. 7.) not the Children of God, Servants of God,
Sinners, not godly bent, Romans 5, 8. Infidels (Tit. 1, 15.) and not faithful
Christians Of congruitie deserve no grace at God his hand Hereby is
overthrown the Pap. doctrine concerning merits of congruitie.

Flan. Art. 23. Ausburgh. art. 4, 20. Sax. art. 3, and 8. Wittemb. art. 5.

3. Whatsoever men, not yet justified before god, do, it is sin: and this
shall we find confirmed
1. In the scripture, where it is clear, that of the unregenerate The best

4. ARTICLE. Of works of Supererogation.
Voluntary works 1 besides, over, and above Gods commandments, which they
call works of Supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogancy, and
impiety. 2 For by them men do declare that they do not only render unto God
as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his sake than of
bounden duty is required: whereas Christ says plainly, When ye have done all that are commanded to you, say, We be unprofitable servants.

The Propositions.
Works of Supererogation
1. Cannot be taught without Arrogancy. Impiety.
2. Are the subversion of the true Religion.

1. Works of Supererogation, which are al voluntary works besides over, and
above the commandments of God are often condemned
1. In the Scriptures where We are commanded To walk, not after the laws of
men, but according to the statutes of God, John 1. 7. Ezekiel. 20. 19.
To hear, not what man he speaks, but what Christ does say. Mat. 9, 7. And
He teaching the duties of Christians, sets before them the Law, and word of
God (Math. 5. 15. and 22. And more than that, he does neither ad, nor require.
He says They worship me in vain, who for doctrine teach the commandments
of men. Mar. 7, 7. Teach them to observe all things whatsoever I have
commanded you. Mat. 28. 20 My sheep Hear my voice. Know not the voice of
Strangers. 10. 10, 27. 5.

the world, etc. Co. 2. 20. etc The doctrine of Devils, 1. Tim. 4, 1. Cursed.

art. 12. Saron. art. 3. 17. Therefore they which teach such works be
Arrogant. Ungodly.


2. Where the works of Supererogation are taught
The Law of God is broken, that the traditions of men may be observed. The S.
Scripture must be contemned, as not sufficient enough to bring men unto the
knowledge of salvation. God is made unwise, in not commanding so necessary
works. Faith, and other spiritual virtues, are brought into utter oblivion.
Perfection is imputed not unto Faith, but unto works, and which is most
detestable, unto the works not commanded but forbidden of God, ordained by
men. The Law of God is thought to be thoroughly satisfied; and more duties
performed than man needed to have done. They which broached, and defend these
errors
Were the Pharisees. Are the Papists who besides what has bine said, do hold
that such works Do merit remission of sins, and that For themselves For
others
Oftentimes do drive away Devils. Evil spirits.
Are tokens of the forgiveness of sins, so well as Baptism; yea deliver from
the wrath of God, so well as Christ. And so they prefer their own works before
The word of God. The Sacraments. Faith. The death of Christ. And therefore may
Their doctrine (...) called (...) doctrine of Devils. The teachers be held
accursed.




15. ARTICLE. Of Christ alone without sin.
CHrist 1 in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all things, sin
only except, from which he was clearly void, both in his life and spirit. He
came to be the Lamb without spot, who by sacrifice of himself once made,
should take away the sins of the world; and sin, as S. John says, was not in
him. 2 But al we the rest, although baptized, and borne again in Christ, yet
offend in many things, and if we say, we have no sin we deceive our selves,
and the truth is not in us.

The Propositions.
1. Christ is truly and perfectly righteous. 2. Al men besides Christ, though
regenerate, be sinners.
1. That Christ was pure from sin, it is abundantly to be seen.
1. In the Scripture. For He was without sin Conceived. Matthew. 1, 20. Borne.
Luke 1. 35.
He appeared to loose, but not to fulfill the works of Satan. 1. John 3, 8. He
lived And was tempted, yet without sin. Heb. 4, 15. And did no sin. 1. Pet.
2, 22. And knew no sin. 2. Cor. 5, 21. And had no sin in him. 1. John. 3.

Therefore a cursed company were they, which laid unto the charge of our
Savior
That he was a violator of the Sabbath, Matthew. 12. 10, etc. Luke 13, 14. John
5* 16, etc.
That he taught, being not lawfulie autorized thereunto. Math. 21, 23. That he
forbad tribute to be given unto Caesar. Luke 23, 2. That he was the destroyer
of the Law. Matthew. 5, 17. That he ouerthrewe all religion, and moved the
people unto rebellion. Luke 23. 5. Such were the
Scribes. Pharisees. High Priests.



2 Al men besides Christ, are sinners. A truth most apparent
1. In the Scripture, which testifies how al men be either Unregenerate; and
they be unrighteous (alredie proved above, page 46, 47) and sin in all things
(confirmed, page 48.) Regenerate; and there are not without sin Original;

2. In the confessions of the godly, especialie In Ausburgh. art. 20 In
Saxony. art. 3, 8. Oppugned is this truth by sondrie adversaries which hold,
that besides Christ, others either have bine, or be perfectly righteous, such
be
The Papists. The Manichies. The Catharans. The Donatists. The Pelagians The
Family of Love. The Marcionites. The Adamits. The Carpocratians. Whereof some
have thought
As the Papists, that The virgin Marie was pure from al sin, both Original.
Actual.
S. Francis has fulfilled every ^ote of the book of God.
That they could not sin so much as in cogitation, as the Manechics.
Catharans.
That theey have bin so perfect that they could justify other men at their
pleasures, as the Donatists. That they needed not to say, as Christ
commands, Forgive us our trespasses, etc. except it were on the behalf of
others. For they cannot sin. Of this opinion are the Pelagians. Fam. of Love.
That they are so pure, even as Yea more holy than Paul, Peter, etc. such are
the Marcionites Adam, and Eua before their fall, as the Adami^^^^. I. Christ
himself, as the Carpocratians.




16. ARTICLE. Of sin after Baptism.
NOt every deadly 1 sin willingly committed after baptism, is sin
against the holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore, the grant of repentance
is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after Baptism. 2 After we have
received the holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin,
and by the grace of God, (we may) rise again, and amend our lives. And
therefore they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin, as long
as they live here, 3 or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.

The Propositions.
1. Every sin is not the sin against the holy Ghost. 2. The very
regenerate may fall, and yet rise again. 3. None are utterly to be cast of,
which unfeignedly repent.
1. Every sin willingly committed after regeneration, is not the sin against
the holy Ghost, and therefore unpardonable; as may be seen
1. In the Scripture, where we find though every sin of it own nature
deserve damnation: yet that there is A sin Stripes. Luke 12, 46.
Which shall be punished with few, Which shall be punished with many
A sin 1. John 5, 6.
Unto death, Not unto death,
A sin against which shall be forgiven,
The Father The Son
The holy Ghost; that never shall be forgiven Matthew. 12, 31. Mar. 3, 39. Luke
12, 10.


2. In the public confessions of the Church of God at Heluet. 2, cap. 8.
Bohem. cap. 4. Saxon. art. 10. Diversely has this doctrine bine invaded. For
Some have thought al sins to be like, as the Stoikes. Pelagians. ^ouinians.
Some taught how none of the godly fathers, and nations from the beginning of
the world, until the 15. year of Tiberius the Emperor, though earnestly
theie did repent, were saved, but were punished alike with utter confusion, as
Manes the Heretic. Some give out that al everlastingly be condemned, which
depart out of this world Before theie are baptized, as the Papists. Before theie
come unto years of discretion; as the Heracites.



2. That the very regenerate may fall, and yet rise again, is a true doctrine
1. Granted upon the Scriptures. For in them we do evidently see That fall
They may Partly by the admonitions Of Christ unto The man healed of the
palsy. John 5, 14. The adultresse. John 8, 11.
Of Paul* unto Th Ephesians. cap. 4, 21. Colossians. cap. 3, 8. The Hebrews.
cap. 5, 12. Timothy 1. T. 1, 9. 2. T. 4, 3 2. T. 2, 22.

Of Peter, unto all the godly 1. Pet. 2, 10. 1. Pet. 5, 8. 2. Pet. 3, 17.

Partly by the example of David. Solomon. Peter, etc.

Their do, even by the 5. petition of the Lord his prayer, were there nothing
beside to prove the same: but look page 31, 32, 43, 54.
That being fallen, they may rise again, by the Exhortations of the Angel
unto the churches of Revel. 2.
Ephesus, Pergamus. Thyatira,
Examples Of Peter, who denied, and yet afterward confessed Christ. Of all the
Disciples, which fled (Matthew. 26, 56.) and yet came again. But subscribe
hereunto will not
The Catharans. The Nouatians. The Iouinians, The Anabaptists. The Fam. of
Love. Who think that the people of God be regenerate into a pure and Angelical
state, so that they be defiled with no contagion of sin.
The Papists simply. For though they grant that the godly may rise again
from sin: yet they deny that they can so do without their Sacrament of
Penance; which is an error. Conc. Trid. sess. 6. can. 29.



2. Grounded by all the godly, and published in the confession of Heluet. 2,
cap. 7. Bohem. cap. 5, 8. Saxon. art. 10, 11. Wittemb. art* 32. Sueu. art. 15.

3. Such as do fall, and yet return again by unfeigned repentance unto the
Lord, are to be received as members of the true Church. And this is verified
1. In the Scripture. For there is it That God Would have al men to be saved
Matthew. 11, 28. 1. Tim. 2, 4.
Is ready to receive the penitent, Luke 15. 7. Luke 19, 41. Iam. 5, 20. 2.
Pet. 3, 10. 1. John 1, 9. Revel. 2, 5, etc.
Does refuse none that return unto him by repentance, as appears in
the example Of the prodigal child. Luke 15, 20. Of the debtor Matthew. 18, 26,
etc.

That upon repentance man must receive, and comfort them which have gone
astraie. So did Paul will The Galathians to restore the weak. Gal. 6, 1. The
Corinthians to comfort the man which had committed incest. 2. Cor. 2, 7, etc.
Philemon to receive One simus. Phil. verse. 12.

2. In the Christian confessions of the godly in Heluet. 2, cap. 14. Bohem. 5.
Ausburgh art. 11. Saxon. art. 3. Wittemb. art. 12. Adversaries. unto this
truth, are
Who leave nothing but th^^apeaseable wrath of God to such as offend after
Baptism.
The Montanists. The Nouatians. The Anabaptists.
That say, how being once regenerate, sin is cut away, as with a rasor, so
that they cannot sin, neither need to repent.
The Messalians. The Fam. of Love.
The desperate, whose sins be either so many, or so grievous, that they
think how God he neither can, nor will forgive them.


17. Article Of Predestination and Election.
PRedestination 1 to life, is the everlasting 5 purpose of God whereby, 2
before the foundations of the world were laid, he has 3 constantlye decreed
by his council secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation 4 those
whom he has chosen 5 in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by Christ
to everlasting 5 salvation, as vessels made 5 to honor, 6 wherefore they
which be endued with so excellent a benesite of God, be called according to
Gods purpose by his spirit vvorking in due season, they through grace obey the
calling, they be justified freely, they be made sons of God by adoption, they
be made like the image of his only begotten s^nne Jesus Christ: they walk
religiously in good works, and at length by Gods mercy, they attain to
everlasting felicity. As 8 the godly consideration of predestination and our
election in Christ is full of svveete, pleasant and unspeakable comfort to godly
persons, and such as feel in themselves the vvorking of the spirit of Christ,
mortefying the works of the flesh, and their earthly members, and dravving up
their mind to high and heavenly things, as well because it does greatly
establish and confirm their faith of eternal salvation to be enjoyed through
Christ, as because it does fervently kindle their love toward God: so, for
curious and carnal persons lacking the spirit of Christ to have continually
before their eyes the sentence of Gods predestination, is a most dangerous
dovvnfal, whereby the devil does thrust them either into desperation, or into
rechlesnesse of most unclean living, no less perilous than desperation.

9 Furthermore, we must receive Gods promises in such wise, as they be
generaly set forth unto us in holy scripture, 10 and in our doings that vvil of
God is to be follovved, which we have expressly declared unto us in the
word of God.

The Propositions.
1. There is a Praedestination unto everlasting life. 2. Praedestination has
bine from everlasting. 3. They which are praedestinate unto salvation cannot
perish. 4. Not al men, but certain are praedestinate to be saved. 5. Why some
are elected, and not others. 6. Who they are which shall be saved. 7. What are
the effects of Praedestination. 8. The use of the doctrine of praedestinatio^,
both to the godly and wicked. 9. What may keep men both from desperation, and
also from security. 10. In our actions the word of God, which is his revealed
will, must be our direction.
1. That among men some be predestinate unto life, it is a truth most apparent
1. In the Scripture 1. By the testimony Of Christ himself Math. 10, 20. 20,
23. 22, 14. 24, 22. 25, 35. Luke 12, 32. 17, 34. John. 6, 37. 10, 26, etc.
Of the Euangeliste, Luke, Act. 13. 48. Apostle Paul Romans 8, 29 etc. 9. 10. 11.

2. By the example of The Creatures Man Angels, Math. 25, 41. ^ude, verse. 6.

40. The two women at the Mill. Math. 24. 40. Al wicked: and yet of them some be
received into the favor of God, and some rejected. Err therefore do they
which stand in opinion
That some are appointed to be saved, but none to be damned. That some in soul,
but in soul and body together none shall be saved, as the Pseudapostles.
Carpocratia^s. Valent. Cerdonites. Manichies. Hieracites. Montanists.



2. In the public writings, and confession of the Churches militant.
2. Predestination began not in time, but before al times. So is it
1. In the Scripture Matthew. 25, 34. Romans 16, 25. 26. Ephesians. 1. 4. etc. 2. Tim.
1, 9.
2. In the public confession of the godly in Heluet. 2. cap. 10. 11. Basil.
Art. 1. France, art. 12. Whereby it appears how those Sophisters be deceived,
who, because God is not included within the compass of any time, but has al
things to come as present continually before his eyes, do ^a^e, that God he
did not in the time long passed only, but still does in the time present
likewise predestinate.

3. They which are predestinate unto life everlasting can-not fall away from
God for altogether, says
1. The Scripture Math. 16. 18. Math. 24, 24. John. 6, 37. John. 10, 28, 129.
Romans 8, 30. etc. Romans 11. 29. 2. Tim. 2, 19. 1. John, 2, 19.
2. The Church of God in Heluet. confess. 2. cap. 10. Basil. confess. art. 1.
France, art. 12. confess. Then wander do they from the truth, which think
That the very elect may fall utterly from grace and be damned. That the number
of those which be predestinate, may both increase and be diminished. So did the
Pelagians.


4. As we grant there is a Predestination and that before al worlds, of men
who must enjoy everlasting life: so we do say not that al men, but certain be
predestinate unto salvation. And so does
1. The word of God Luke, 10, 20. Luke, 12, 7. John, 10, 14. 2. Tim. ^, 10.
2. The Churches reformed in Heluet. 2. cap. 10. Basil. Art. 1. France, art.
12. Fland. Art. 16. What they are therefore appears, which say that
Not certain, but al shall be saved, yea the very As the Origenistes.
Libertines Catabaptis^^^
Devils Damned
Al men be elected unto everlasting life, Furthermore they are not to be liked
that curiously will enquire what the number of them is that shall be saved, or
damned.


5. The causes why some are predestinate unto life, are set down most plainly
^. In the Scripture, where may be seen 1. The cause efficient to be
th'euerlasting purpose of God Romans 8, 28. Romans 9. 11. Ephesians. 1, 5. etc. 2. Tim.
1, 9.
2. The cause formal, God his infinite mercy Exodus 33, 19. Romans 9, 15.
3. The cause material, the blood of 1. Christ Act. 2, 38. Act. 3, 20, etc.
Act. 10, 43, etc. 1. Cor. 15, 22, etc. Ephesians. 1. 3. etc. 1. Tim. 2. 5. 1. Pet.
1, 18, 19.
4. The cause final, or end, why both God the Father has loved, and Christ
thus suffered, namely The glory of God Ephesians. 1. 6* 12. Prou. 16. 4. Isa. 5.
16.
The salvation of man Romans 8, 29. Romans 9. 21.


2. In the public writings of the Churches militant with a sweet consent
according to this article, And this condemns the impiety of al those which
think
That God does not predestinate man of his mercy, but that man does
predestinate himself by his merits. That God beheld in every man whether he
would use his grace well, and believe the Gospel, or no; and as he saw a man
well affected, so he did predestinate him. That beside his will there was some
other cause in God why he choase one, and cast off another: but this cause and
reason was hid from us. That men are predestinate unto life, if they do
believe; But Predestination is not conditional, but certain. For they which
are elected in Christ shall, and if they live, must and will believe. That God
is partial, and unjust, for choosing some, and refusing others; calling many,
and electing but few.

6 Though true it be the Lord knows all, and every of his elect: yet has he
revealed unto us certain notes and tokens, whereby we may see, and certainly
know whether we be of that numer, or not. For such as be ordained unto
everlasting life, if they live
1. They be called unto the knowledge of salvation, by the preaching of the
word. 2. They obeie that calling through th*operation of God his spirit,
working within them. 3. They feel in their souls, the Spirit of God bearing
witness unto their spirits, how they are the children of God. 4. They walk
religiously in all good works. And this is evident, and clear
1. In the Scripture, where is set down, of the predestinate unto salvation*
1. The calling Romans 8, 30. Gal. 1, 15. 1. These. 2, 12. 2. Tim. 1. 9. Revel. 17,
14.
2. The Obedience unto the word. Matthew. 13, 11. Romans 1, 5. Romans 16. 19. 26. 2.
Cor. 13, 5. Ephesians. 1, 13.
3. Th'adoption into the children of God. Romans 8, 15. 16. Matthew. 6, 9. Ephesians.
1, 5. Gal. 4, 5. 6.
4. The holiness of life, and conversation. Ephesians. 1, 4. Ephesians. 2, 10. 2. These.
2, 13. 14. Tit. 2, 11. 12.

2. In the 2. public Heluet. confession, cap. 10. Sundry adversaries has
this truth, but principalie.
The Papists, who reach that none are to think that they are of the number of
the predestinate Con^. Trid. (...). Cap. ^* C^^^ ^^.
Such as think it is a sufficient argument of election, if they be outwardly
called by the word, though they have none inward calling of the Spirit. The
Schuenkfeldians, and al such as depending upon revelations, condemn the
ordinary calling of God by the ministry of hi^ word.


7 Diverse be the effects of predestination: but chiefly it brings to the elect
1. In this life, Justification. 2. In the life to come, Glorification. Always
a conformity to the image of th'onlie begotten son of God
1 In suffering trobles. 2. In enioieng glory. So witness
1. The scripture Romans 8, 30. Romans 8, 29, 17. Matthew. 25, 34.
2. The god lie, who In any age have bine Do live at this present. And this is
flatly against the^ which oppugn either
1. The justification by faith through the hearing of the word preached, as do
the Infidels. Epicures. Atheistes, of which read more above, page 39.
2. The glorious condition of man in blessed immortality. such are The
Appollinari^ns. The Millinaries. Those heretics which deny the resurrection
of the flesh. as the Carpocratians. Valentinians. Cerdonites. Manichies.
Montanists, etc.






8. The consideration and doctrine of predestination, is
1. To the godly full Sweet, Pleasant, Comfortable. Because
It greatly confirms their faith in Christ. It does fervently kindle their
love toward God. So says
1. The scripture. Romans 8 18, 31. etc. Ephe. 1. 15, etc. 1. Cor. 15, 14, 15,
etc.
2. The Church of God in all places.


2. To the wicked and reprobate Sour Unsavory, Uncomfortable. As that which
they think, though most untruly and wickedly, brings them either
To despair of Gods mercy, being without faith. Not to fear his justice
being so extremely wicked. Where as* neither
.1 By the word of God. 2. By any sound confession Can any man collect that he
is a vessel of wrath, prepared unto damnation: but contrariwise, by many great
arguments may persuade himself that he is in the favor of God, as in the next
table following, plainly does appear. Therefore they are to be held as
heretics against the faith, which give out that this doctrine leads
Unto desperation, which is with out al comfort, Loosenes of life, and so unto
Atheis. me. And therefore to be published neither by mouth nor by writing: such
were the heretics called from hence, Predestinati. Are the new Pelagians,
the Fam. of Love.






9. That men the better may avoid
Desperation, Carnal security, Theie are in their minds firmly to remember
1. That the promise of grace and favor to men is universal, Matthew. 11, 28.
Matthew. 18, 14. John. 3, 15. Romans 3, 22. 1. Tim. 2, 4. 2. Pet. 3* 6. Read Romans
9. 10. 11.

2. That the doctrine of predestination is to be preached not unto a few, but
vniuersalie to al men Matthew. 28, 19, 20. Mark. 16, 15, 16. Luke 24, 45, 46, 47
3. That the seals of the covenant be appointed to al in general. For
Concerning Baptism, Al are to be baptized, Matthew. 28, 19. Mark. 16, ^5.
Touching the Lord his supper, Christ faith Of the bread, Take, eat, this is
my body. Of the cup, Drink ye al of it. Matthew. 26, 26, etc. 1. Cor. 11, 23.
etc.


4. That as the disobedience of Adam brought condemnation upon al men: so the
blood and obedience of Christ is able, and al sufficient to wash away al
sins, and that of al men. 5. That none ever yet did fly unto the mercy of
God by unfeigned repentance, but he was received into favor: so among others was
David after his adultery. Manasses after his idolatry. Peter after his
apostacy. The thief hanged with Christ, even at the last gasp. The Nin^ui^s
after many* and grievous offenses committed So that as theie are not to be
heard, which do say
The numer of the elect is but small, and seeing we are uncertain whether we be
of that company or not, we will proceed on as we have begone: That God is an
acceptor of persons, and so unjust in choosing some, and refusing others: So is
it the part of al, and every man,
Not to refuse the mercies of God, as generalie: so most graciously offered
unto al men. Not to despere in ^espect either Of the greatness Of the multitude
Of his sins.

Not to provoke the Lord to execute his vengeance through profaneness of
life, and security.




10. In our doings, but cheefely in the matter of Predestination, we are to
follow
1. Not our oune judgments, and what seems good in our oune opinions. 2.
The will of God. And that will to Not which is concealed from us, of God his
omnipotency, whereby he is minded to govern at his pleasure the things by him
self created. Of this will is mention made Psalm. 115, 3. Isa. 46, 10. Romans 9,
15.

THey also are to be had accursed, that presume to say that every man shall be
saved by the law, or sect which he professes, so that he be diligent to frame
his life according to that law, and the light of nature. For holy Scripture
does set out unto us only the name of Jesus Christ, whereby men must be saved.

19. ARTICLE. Of the Church.
THe 1 visible 2 Church of Christ, is a congregation of 3, 4 faithful men, in
the which the 5 pure word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly
ministered, according to Christ's ordinance, in all those things that of
necessity are requisite to the same.

As 6 the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch have erred: so also the
7 Church of Rome has erred, not only in their living and manner of ceremonies,
but also in matters of faith.

The Propositions.
1 There is a Church of Christ, not only invisible, but also visible. 2 There
is but one Church. 3 The visible Church is a catholic church. 4 The word of
God was, and is before the Church. 5 The marks and tokens of the visible
church, are the due and true administration of the Word and Sacraments. 6 The
visible Church may err both in doctrine and conversation. 7 The church of Rome
most shamefully has erred both in life, ceremonies, and matters of Faith. 8
There is no salvation without this church, and therefore every man is firmly
to join thereunto, and never to depart there from by schism, and contention.
1 A true saying is it. The Lord, and he only, knows who are his. For to
man the Church of christ is partly
1 Invisible; which are all th elect, who are or shall be either 1 In Heaven,
triumphing. 2 In earth fighting against the Flesh World Devil These as members
of the Church, are said to be invisible, not because the men are not seen,
but for that their faith and conscience is not perfectly known unto us.


2 Visible, whereof some are 1 For God. 2 Against God. Al notwithstanding well
thought of: and accounted faithful, so long as they make no manifest and open
rebellion against the truth. And this
1 Is gathered out of the S. Scripture, where is touched the Church 1

Of Paul, 2. Tim. 2. 20 This truth has many adversaries, whereof
Some renounce our Christ, the Savior of mankind, and so think his people are
not the Church as the Jews. Turks. Anabapt. Heretics.
Some deny the triumphing state of the godly in heaven, and dream of a
glorious condition in this world, as the familiars. H. N. Vitell*
Some think the Church Catholic to be visible, as the Papists. Some suppose
the Church militant is not visible at all, as the Libertines. Some give out
that the Church is void of sin and sinners, as the Donatists Anabaptists.

2. When we do say
That the Church is Visible, Invisible,
That there is a church VVeast, East, Greek, Latin, Italian, English We
think not that Christ has diverse churches, but that the Church
Is diversely taken, Has many particular Churches (as the sea many arms)
contained in it. For the visible Church is
Not many congregations A Congregation. As may be read.

Church. None are in a rect faith or belief, but only the Communaltie of Love.
The Communaltie of Love are the Saints of God, and his acceptable people.
Theie which are not of the Family, have no living god; and be without Gods
service.







^. The visible church property understood, is but a part of the Catholic:
yet forasmuch as it is a Congregation of the faithful, who be
For calling Governors and subjects, Noble and base, Rich and poor, Teachers
and learners,
For sex Men Women,
For age Old Young*
For their country. Jews and Gentiles, Graecians and Barbarians, It may be well
called a Catholic Church. This
1. Is grounded upon the word of God. Where we find that excluded is No calling

Calling, as the rude Romanistes, to the Clergy. Contrie, as the Donatists, to

excluding al others.




4. Seeing the visible Church of Christ is a Congregation of men (either in
th'eies of God, or at the least in the judgment of the godly) faithful: it
follows that the word of God must be before the Church, for
1. Time* Because the word is The seed: the faithful The corn Luke 8, ^1 The
children. 1. Pet. 1, 23
The rock, or foundation; the faithful the house Matt. 16, 1^. Ephesians. 2, ^0.

2. Auctority: for so much as the voce Of the Church, is the voce of man, who
Has erred, May err.
Of the scripture is the voce of God, 2. Tim. 3, 16. 2. Pet. 1, 21. Who cannot
Deceive Be deceived. Of this judgment are the Churches reformed, as appears
in their confess.

Flan. art. 3, 7. Saxon. art. 1, 11. Sueuia. art. 1. This makes to the
strengthening of us, against those Popish opinions; that the Church
1. Was before (...) Word, for time 2. Is above the Word* for authority.





5. There is the visible Church, where
1. The pure word of God is syncerely preached. 2. The Sacraments instituted
by Christ are duly administered. And so say not we only, but besides
1. The scripture; where in we find that a note of the visible Church is the 1.
Word preached, Luke 8, 21. John 8, 47. John. 10* 27. Gal. 1, 8 1. These. 5, 20.
1. John 4, 2, etc. 2. John verse 9.
2. Administration of the Sacraments. Matthew.* 28, 19. Romans 6 3. 1. Cor. 6, 11.
1. Cor. 12, 13. Luke 23, 19. 1. Cor. 1. 20. etc.

2. The god lie in reformed Churches Confess. Heluet. 1, art. 14. Heluet. 2,
cap. 17. Bohem. cap. 8. France, art. 27, 28. Saxon. art. 11. Wittemb. art. 32.
Sueuia. art. 15. Some, and they also godly men, ad besides for a note of the
visible Church, Discipline. But because discipline in part, is included in
the other marks mentioned, both we, and in effect, al other Churches reformed,
ouerpasse it in this place, as no token simply of the visible Church. Neither
do we tie the Church so strictly to the other signs, that we think al those to
be without the Church, and Antichristians, which neither do hear the word
orderly preached, nor receive the sacraments; if so be they would, and can
neither hear the one, nor receive the other: at which time the Church is not
visible, but invisible, as in the time of tyranny, and cap tiuitie. On the
other side we renu^ce, as altogether Antichristian, the opinions
1. Of the Papists, who allege for tokens of the true Church Antiquity,
Unity, Universality, Succession, Miracles. Revelations. But these are not so,
Because theie are not derived from the very nature of the Church, but are
meerelie external. Because they are tokens as well of the false, as of the true
Church. Because theie are not good, except there be warranted by the word of
God. Because it was fore told by the Spirit of God, that the coming of
Antichrist should be with all power, signs, and lieng wonders, etc. 2. These.
2, 9, etc.

2. Of some, which make discipline, and that their own too, such an essential
argument of the visible Church, as theie think where that is not, though both
the Word, and the Sacraments be rectlie ministered and received, there 1. The
Magistrates are Tyrants. 2. The Ministers are false prophets 3. No Church of
God is. 4. Antichristianitie does reign.




6. Nothing is more certain, than that the church militant and visible, may
err, and that
1. In doctrine, 2. In conversation, Else would it not have bine said to the
Church
By our Savior Christ, concerning 1. Doctrine, Take heed, etc. Matt. 24. 4.
Believe it not. Matt. 24, 23, and 26. Beware of the leaven, etc. Mar. 8, 15.
Many shall be deceived: yea* the very elect if it were possible. Matt. 24. ver.
11, 24. Shall he find faith on the earth? Luke 18, 8.
2. Conversation. Iniquity shall be increased. The love of many shall wax
cold. Matthew. 24, 12.

By Paul touching Doctrine. We know in part. 1. Cor. 13. 12. Antichrist
sits in the temple of God 2. These 2, 4. Beware of dogs of idle workmen, of
concision. Phi. ^. 1.
Conversation. There is a fight. Romans 7. 22. Restore, etc. least thou also be
tempted. Bear one another burden Gal. 6, 1. Now that the Church has erred,
either the
Superstition, Here sies, Atheism Now reigning at
Jerusalem, Alexandria, Anti och. The most famous places in th'vniuersal
world, do witness. And this is subscribed unto by the churches in
Heluet. confess. 2. cap. 17 Saxon. confess. art. 11. Wittemb. art. 32. Sueuia.
confess. art. 15. But this truth is oppugned by
1. The Papists which hold that the Church cannot err in doctrine. 2. The
Donatistes Anabap. who say the church cannot err for manners.







7. Justly is the Church of Rome condemned of us, and of al reformed Churches.
Because not only it has erred, but still cursedly does offend
1. In life. for there The harlot has a better life, Than she that is a Romans
wife. Al things are vendible. A man may be what he will, saving a godly man.
2. In ceremonies, which are For numer, infinite: such as neither we, nor our
fathers could bear. For use Vain. For many of them are To no purpose. To
none order. To no comlines.
Damnable: inasmuch as they are held Necessarily to be observed, which is
against Christian liberty. To merit, which brings unto nothing, the
sacrifice of Christ.


3. In doctrine. For 1. Against the law of God it maintains Idolatry.
Invocation of creatures. Disobedience unto Magistrates. Whoredom. Perjury so
it be not to a Catholic.
2. To the overthrow of the Gospel, of man his salvation, it ascribes The
original, partly To the grace of God. To the force of nature.
The substance, partly To the justice of God. To the merits of man.
The end partly To the glory of God. To the honor of creatures. Again, look
we into the heads of The antichristian Synagogue and we shall see that of them
some have bine
1. Coniurers, and forcerers, as Pope Martine, 2. Syluester. 2. 3. John 19. 20.
21, Gregory 6. and Gregory the 7. Benedict. 9*
2. Heretics. For* Pope Syricius, Calixtus, Leo 9. Paschalis, if not simply,
yet in some men, and women condemned marriage. Liberius was an Arrian.
Anastasius 2. an Acatian. Honorius a Monothelite. John 22. a D^rmitane.
Caelestinus a Nestorian.
3. World Athely profane men. Pope Sixtus builded a stews for Sodomites.
Paul. 3. received 40000* ducats monthly of curti^ans. Leo 10 denied the
immortality of the soul. John 23 was pronounced a devil incarnate, at the
counsel at Constance. Hence it came that
1. Rome Has bine called Babylon, and that by August de ci^itat. Dei, lib. 18.
Hieron in praefat. lib. de Spiritu S.
Was said to show the parts of the Gentiles, rather than of Christians, even
by the late Pope Paus 5.
2. Bernard said the Romans are wise to do wickedness, but be altogether
fools unto goodness. They are hateful to heaven and earth, yea, and hurtful to
both: wicked against God, rash against holy things, seditious among
themselves. De consider. ad Eugen. lib. 4. 3. The Pope was proclaimed Antichrist
at Rhemes, by the counsel under Capet. What they are then, it appears, which
sa^e, the Church of Rome does not, yea, cannot err at al.







8. Although it be not expreslie set down: yet is it necessarily derived from
this Article, that
1. None can be saved, which are not members of this true church 2. Every one
is firmly to join and never to forsake this communion of sancts And this is
evident
1. In the word of God, where we are commanded To hear Christ. Matthew. 17, 5.
To come unto Christ. Matt. 21, 28. To beware Of false prophets. Matt. 7, 15. Of
the leaven of the P^^t. and Sad. Mat. 16, 6. Of dogs, Phil. 32. Of idle workme^
Phil. 32. Of concision Phil. 32. Lest there be any that spoil us through
philosophy. Col. 2, 8. Lest we be plucked away with th'error of the wicked.
2. Pet. 3, 7.
To try the spirits, etc. 1. John 4, 1. To go out of Babylon. Revel. 18, 4.
To come out from among th'vngodlie, etc. 2. Cor. 6, 17. For
1. The benefits which the Church does, and shall enjoy, are most singular 1.
Corporal Matthew. 6, 33. Luke 21, 28.
2. Spiritual John 17, 3. Gal. 4, 6. Col. 3, 13. 1. John 1, 9.
3. Eternal Matthew. 25, 21. John 16, 22. Matthew. 13, 43. Romans 8, 17.

2. The punishments which the enemies of the Church shall have, are many and
grievous. 1. In this life Wars, and destruction Matthew. 22, 7. Induration of
heart. John 12, 40.
2. In the world to come Expulsion from the Supper. Luke 14 24. Exclusion from
the marriage. Matthew. 25, 12. A portion in the cup of the wrath of God. Reu. 1^,
10, in the lake etc. Reave. 21, 8. Damnation. Phil. 3, 19. Therefore let the^
take heed
Who, whatsoever considerations they may seem to have, (...) to join with
this church, I mean Papists. Liber. Anabaptists. Schismatikes.
Who will ^ome not only with this church but with all other besides, if
occasion do serve, I^ ^urkie, with turks At Rome with Antichrist At home with
Christ Suc^ are
The Familiars. (...)
