TO THE READER
BEING neither Master nor Professor of Writing* I may be Censured as an
impertinent Intruder into an other man's Provinc^ by publishing these my
unpollish'd Essays I did not purpose at first either a Book or a Publication:
but have been prevaild with herein beyond my primitive intention. As I have had
Divertion and Delight in composing, if any on^ shall receive Pleasure or Profit
in perusing or immitating these imperfect Ideas, it will afford a Satisfaction
Beyond imagination to ye Author of yem.

A Panegiric on the Art of Fair Writing
Fair Writing is a curious Art,
Which we do not Mechanic call,
Nor may we tern it Liberal --
Yet such as does them both to men impart.
Both do from thence beginning take,
Both do thereby their progres make.
Writing we do no Science find
And yet thereof we truly Say,
It Is to all Sciences the way:
From thence comes Illustration to ye mind;
Invented to delight the eyes,
And despence hidden Mysteries.
Writing the Muses Register.
(...) Doctrine downwards does convey
And Nations History display;
The Memories chief storehouse does assist her
To Cultivate each Faculty,
And perfect Ingenuitie.
This Art to man has God made known,
This Art have wise men much desired,
To this though many have aspired;
Yet few have made it perfectly their own;
This the Ornament of Providence;
And of Humane Inteligence.
It Is Writing does Facilitate,
Commerce and all Society
Is jointed and made strong thereby
Friends absent hereby do Communicate,
Each Secret thought and Sentiment,
Each private purpose and Intent.
This Art gives Fame Celebritie,
To Justice Splender and Renown,
To Virtue Glory as its Crown;
The Ligament of Civil Polecie
Which covers Secrets as with night,
And works of Darkness brings to light.
Weston
