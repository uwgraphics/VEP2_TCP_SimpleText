A VINDICATION OF THE KING WITH Some OBSERVATIONS upon the TWO HOUSES.

By a true Son of the Church of ENGLAND, and a Lover of his Countries Liberty.

London, Printed Anno Domini, 1642.

A Vindication of the KING, etc.
I Shall not be curious to satisfy the Reason of any prepossest opinion, yet
since the Times has given an open Press to clear every imagination which is
not stifled in this Dampe: I have endeavored to contract my own Meditations in
a narrow room; and rather expose them to the censure of the most judicious,
then rest satisfied alone, and admit this cloudy surface to overwhelme so vast
a Body.

I confess it was no mean part of my happiness in our dangerous extremes,
to hope for a happy Union by that Sovereign medicine of a fading State, a
Parliament and knowing the admirable affection of our gracious Sovereign to the
peace and quiet of the Kingdom, though it was His unspeakable misfortune,
never to know the misery of the People, till their discontents were grown to
that head, they became almost (if not altogether uncureable, by those
unreasonable Monopolies, exacted by some ill affected agents, conducing little
to his advantage, but to the furthering of their ambition, who not
withstanding, could as easily desert him in his misery, as before be the ready
instruments to importune him to this mischief, upon pretense of a Legal
Authority, which who knows not a Prince, may be soon mistaken in, since none
can be so silly, as to believe him a studied Lawyer: Yet that this should
expose us to so great an adventure, as not only to divest him of this suspected
arbitrary power, but to confer an absolute government to any whatsoever,
renders me no other action then the Poets, Incidit in Syllam cupiens vitare
caribdim.


But if you please to take the true State of the business, let your Impartial
Judgment confer with your reason, upon these few notorious truths. What has
the King denied which concern our Liberty, and are the undoubted securities of
our happiness, under the regiment of a Just and unquestionable Monarchy?

Are not our Rights and Properties already established this Parliament, by such
acts of Grace, as could never find presidents from His Ancestors, besides the
utter extirpation of Shipmony, Monopolies, upon what pretense soever, those
arbitrary Courts of Justice, High Commission, Star Chamber, Marshalseas, etc.
Has he not importuned the settling of Religion in his purity, and that there
might be a Law, to secure the tender consciences of those who will not agree
the Ceremonies. Are not the taking away these sufficient ground to desolve our
Jealosies, if ever we mean to be satisfied. As for their fears, I wish we had
as little reason to suspect the fomenters, as we have the King, who is so
clearly divested of any power, to make good the least injustice, that it is too
great a hazard on his part to adventure what our consciences enforce us to make
good for Him on our part: and the conservation of those are so attested by him
(in the word of a King) with such unusual expressions, that if they came from
a stranger, (I suspected not an infidel) I was bound to believe in charity,
witness those serious asseverations, God so deal with Me and my Children, as
I intend to conserve my Parliament in its Privileges, the Rights of the
Subject, and the true professed Protestant Religion, God so prosper me in what I
take in hand.

Is there yet a further way to establish them, whereby they may be so secure,
that a violation may seem impossible, with out the subversion of the very
letter of the Law: Why is it not proposed if it be no Invasion of that Just
Prerogative was never denied his Ancestors? and what he has deserved of us,
that he may not be as far trusted, is as hard to object, as easily answered. If
then we must needs agree that therebeing nothing so clear, why should any
subtle pretenses, hinder our desired accommodation, unless there be that
intend the alteration of our Government, and how inconsistant that may prove to
a People already managed, under the united order of a virtuous King, daily
experience offers it too easy of conjecture. Yet for our better satisfaction,
lets weigh the amends we are like to make our selves, from these few
Inconveniences, amongst the thousands which daily expose themselves to our view.

1. The unlimited power of the two Houses have already assumed into their own
hands, a formal all Ordinance countermanding, suspending, nay, creating Acts
of Parliament, though not in the name of Acts, yet in the power of Acts,
whereby both King and People are obliged to obey; how to distinguish this
Ordinance from an Act of State, I am not well satisfied; yet I have heard it
called Treason in one of their Members, for this comparison, though with that
cautious provisoe, That it should be no leading case to future ages for Judges
to imitate. Is this the security of our undoubted Rights we have so long
endeavored: who carries not now his life in his hand, managed by an exact
power of a bare Vote, which if any contradicts, must suffer under the name of a
malignant party, though of their own Members, and not proceeded against by the
Justice of any president Acts, but condemned by the Votes of the present
Session; and if this be not an absolute subversion of the Rights of Parliament,
and destructive to the fundamental Laws of our Kingdom (wherein our liberty
consists) I would fain be satisfied what is, for it is most apparent to,
whosoever examines their ordinary procedings; we have no law left but what
serves their turn; and if that be defective, to punish those they please to
call Delinquents, their Legislatiue Ordinance can as well supply that defect,
as it could make that obnoxious, which till this Parliament no man could ever
call a fault.

2. This continuing power of the two Houses, which if they had had a mind
should ever be remitted, they would have either expressed it in their first
demand, and limited it to a certain time, wherein they might have completely
qualified the disquiet countenance of a troubled Estate; or since have
endeavored some Remonstrance for our satisfaction in that particular: For I
would fain be answered, First, if they sit while they list, and pass what they
list, whether they have not (during their pleasure) subverted our Monarchy by
their democracie and Invested themselves of a power more Arbitrary, then the
Monarchical Government could pretend to, that having his limitations and Rules
of Law, which the Judges are to answer (if they mistake) or those that advise
the King; their democracy having no bounds, be but a thing of Yesterday, and
which as yet we cannot understand, assuming to themselves the sole power to
Judge of our dangers, and propose such remedy, as may answer their pretenses.

2. How every conscientious man can dispense with that sacred Oath of
Allegiance, wherein He calls God to Witness for the Vindication of his Princes
Just Prerogative* and their Protestation to maintain an absolute and unlimited
power in the two Houses, wrested to those Ordinances expressly inhibited by
His Majesty's special commands; in my understanding it is to no other purpose,
then to lead us into a Maze, where when we are lost by our understanding (which
must necessarily be the principal of our subversion, They will offer us a
Clue, shall either lead us to their premeditated designs* whereby of necessity
they will become our Masters, or to an inevitable Ruin, before we know the
reason of our Fears and Iealousies, being the old Rule they so often enveighed
against, First to trouble a State, then to subvert the Government. Let it not
be objected now, that I am against Parliaments, for (God knows) I am for them,
and as Zealous for my Country as any Man that lives: But in my opinion, the
best way to secure our Liberty had been, That our Members of both Houses might
continue subjects still, liable to the Regiment of those Laws which shall be
enacted by them, wherein they will have a care of securing their own Estates
for future, as well as ours, which was certtinly the intentions of our well
advised Ancestors, in exposing so great a trust into their hands, When the
Prince called for their advice in matters of greatest concernment; but by this
continued Session, they not only are invested of an absolute power, but are
able to make themselves amends at leisure for those moneys exhausted out of
their Estates, while we groan under the insupportable burden of theirs (as
they call them) Legal Taxes: and ^ns they may well be careless what Laws are
past, never intending to be observers, but Lords of what they make.

3. Who are these pretended reformers of the Commonwealth, but the very
Instruments who were the favorites during our oppression; I need not name them
to any, who has once attended the Epidemicke trouble of our age, and what
unheard of Conversion we can make of their Lives, whereby such a Confidence
should be reposed in them, as to divest so Religious and Just a Prince of his
unquestionable Rights and Prerogatives, and confer such an unlimited power so
readily upon them, if we return our former senses, renders me amazed; it is not
amiss to ruminate some words His Majesty used in his own vindication at
New Market, My Lords, lay your hands on your hearts, who were the Contrivers of
these Illegal taxes, wherewith you have so incensed my people: to whose
advantage were these impositions levied? are my Exchequers at all larger? or
did you not rather conduce to your peculiar benefit, who were the only
perswaders of them, that you have now repayd me with condign thanks. Those
Favorites being content to be the Causers, though not the Companions of their
Princes misfortunes: being like Crows upon a Carkase, that have no sooner
bared the bones, but they are flown. Are we not yet sensible the rules of
policy, not of honesty, to secure their lives and fortunes, not their
consciences, exposed you to this politic, not public service; and had you not
in so exact a course served your turns of these Loyal pretenders; they had
been as liable to the extremity of Justice, as the greatest Delinquents that
underwent the most heavy censures; and undoubtedly had had their deserved
shares, which would have given a better Color to their upright proceedings as
they would have you ^o believed. If they had impartially distributed Justice
amongst the then Malignant party: but now that we should be so stupid as to b^
circumvented with any pretenses whatsoever, which outstrip the Essential
rules of Government or Reason, and confide in the positive Vo(...) ambitious
party (for ought we know) would admit my perswa^^^^ be a madman that could
allow that in his opinion, ^ut make th(...) you will, suppose them to be the
most real and upright (...) lives and consciences in the whole world: They are
but the Counsel of the King and Kingdom, not their Commanders, for the ^ealth
of our State is admirably balanced if that have but his due proportion; The
Parliament consisting of three bodies, the King, the Lords, and Commons, so
that if two should be destructive, and the third remayn sound during those Laws
already in force, there can be no danger to our Kingdom, but if either of the
two can pass at their pleasure what they will, the third must then of
necessity stand for a Cipher, for consenting or disagreeing is then of equal
value, and in my opinion it is a president of too great an adventure, for
suppose the King and the Major part of the Lords should agree an Ordinance or
Law, we should think extremely prejudicial to the Liberty of the Subject, our
Commons should be concluded peremptorily against their Consents: I heard an act
not long since vouched in president that had bin ratified against their Consent
of the Lords Spiritual, where they declared nec possumus nec volumus
consentire, and this so rare we could not find a second. At the Parliament at
Oxford in 17 H. 3. when the Lords were not there present, they were fain to
dissolve the House without passing one Act, confirming my first proposition.
That the consent of two bodies are not of force to make Us Laws without the
third, much less conclude; the King who is not only the Supreme Head, but the
very soul, whose power gives life to their actions, when their body is once
dissolved, besides how in incoherent is it, with that authority committed to
them, for if the Parliament (which are only His great Council) offer him a
Bill, which He is bound to agree, it was more then ever His Ancestors were;
and of their Counselors, it must necessarily follow, they are His Commanders.

We have a Maxim with the Subject, Modus and conventio vincunt legem. In
former ages and ever since Parliaments were in use, Le Roy s'aviser a were
sufficient authority to make a Bill of both Houses unwarrantable; and how the
King has lost that Right, or what new Laws are found out destructive to that
Prerogative, I never yet read, nor ever shall, unless some such new Ordinance
or bare Votes can pretend to such an un warranted power (whereof there was
never yet found a President) which can have no other operation upon my
understanding, then, That the Votes of the present Members which can at their
pleasures dispose the undoubted Privileges of the Crown (by a Law recorded
only in their own breasts) and given out to us under the gilded Title of the
Peoples Liberty, when indeed they are but Golden Chains in stead of Bulrushes,
and (reserved till occasion shall make it too apparent) may find out a Law of
equal force to dispose the Crown, when they shall so far debilitate the Prince
as he shall be no way able to make resistance; nor when the supporters are not
only undermined but clearly taken away; by what reason can we imagine the
Structure may continue (...), that you may be sure we will not unjustly charge
them be pleased to observe with me their Orders in these few instances.

1. Their countenancing these unwarranted Acts, either by a seditious huddle of
indigent people, and so procuring Petitions to necessitate these premeditated
proceedings, or levying an absolute War against the King; securing us upon no
other reasons then that they are the representative body of the Kingdom, and
therefore our Obedience, rather to be expected, then our Reason satisfied,
which indeed is true enough if they proceeded upon that warranted rule to which
no man could refuse observance, or being entrusted by us with the power of
preceding Parliaments; that they would pursue points of so high concernment,
with the same mature reasons and deliberation, as they have done and then they
might well expect our readiness to secure their actions: But suppose we elect
one that should speak or endeavor to exact Treason, does our election bid as
to secure him, or will future Parliaments blame us hereafter for giving up so
great a Delinquent to the Justice of the Laws? dare we countenance their
Intentions, who have fetched Presidents from the weakest Princes, (nay, and go
beyond them too) is the disadvantage of as able a Prince as ever yet held the
Sceptor, nay, and offer their suppositions to the Vulgar, If the Prince be a
fool, a child, etc. ought he not to be governed by his Council, though it be
against his consent, if it stand with the public benefit? what Implication to
make of this I understand not, but I am sure that it was none of our meaning
when we gave our voice in the Election: Can an Ordinance of Parliament without
the consent of the King renew a repeated Act, and with so bold a countenance
trample upon the heels of that Parliament in Richard the seconds time, and this
very repealed Act renewed this Parliament, be within one step of it, wherein
the Parliament took the Crown and gave it to the then Earl of Bullingbrook,
which was the reason of so much Blood in our Civil Wars, and was not well
settled till of late years? And can we blame the King if He desires shelter
from such a storm? If it be their intentions, sure one Bullingbrook will not
serve their turns, since there have been equal shares in this so great an
adventure. And to vouch the Oath of this Usurper H. 4. which came in at their
benevolence to a Prince of an unquestionable Title, and never offered before or
since to any English King that ever we read or heard of (but with its
limitations) is so far from their Loyal pretenses, that they are rather to be
believed studied mischiefs and endeavors, to embroyle the Kingdom in a Civil
War.

2. To disingage all that would out of affection or love, interest themselves
to secure the Kings Person, and Dignity, (it being too apparent to any
ordinary understanding) that such proceedings were never warranted by any
presidents of preceding Parliaments, or those Laws they call Fundamental in
our Kingdom, they scandalize such with the name of Malignant Persons, whereby
His Meniall Servants either absolutely refused, or durst not adventure His
attendance, and countenance this medley in such a sense, that the King himself
is perpetually traduced under this obstruse Dialect; which though they dare not
put down in plain English, for fear the most violent amongst them should be
ashamed to own it; yet by such an implication, as the plainest capacity
cannot but blush, and with admiration wonder, whereto this may tend, I would
fain be satisfied, what these might not do, when they had once mastered these
their malignants: For if you will give us as much reason as the Ants, you must
believe a Winter may come, as well as think a Summer is come: durst any man
then oppose their proceedings, when they have reduced all to their own Terms,
do you not speak your selves the very Law, and we as we ought to yield no
appeal from Parliament, being the highest Court in the Kingdom; yet in this
sense as the King is a part of it (for otherwise I understand not by what
right) it has the pre-eminence of those they call the Kings Courts, being both
conveened by the same Royal Authority.

3. The discountenancing any Petitions whatsoever (wherein we desire to
interpose our advice for accommodation or otherwise) though never so agreeing
with our Laws, unless they stand with the sense of their party, as if all our
Wisdom were shut up in so narrow limits, and these the only men in England
iafallible: yet give me leave to aver, that to the number of almost two hundred
approved able men, whose warranted judgment and sufficiencies were the only
inducement of their Countries Election, have been feign to sit still, and see
things carried in this disorderly confusion, (peremptorily against their
earnest endeavors) and have not been so much as asked their opinions in matters
of greatest concernment; but being unwilling to expose their Consciences to so
high a Guilt, have with drawn themselves as unusefull Members of such a Body.

4. To insinuate a belief of their care to the Vulgar, They have perpetually
surmised terrible jealousies, which have produced no other effect, then a
desired suspicion of the King, yet these offered upon most improbable
conjecturs, as every private Letter is sufficient grounds to piece up their
designs, or by such persons whose private discontents, lead them to offer
these high indignities to that sacred person, they were never worthy to serve
in the meanest office; and though there lives were so notorious for their
forms extravagancies, they have by these superfluous invectives found
countenance, till presuming upon their merits, which were none except to abuse
the King, can be called desert; that they have been given up to rapine, or some
such damnable sin, that nature would never have pardoned, if we had had no Law;
Yet these Men's informations, sufficient grounds to traduce the King, these
Letters most necessary Animaduersions to leavie Forces, to maintain the Kings
Forts, Towns, aed Magazines against him, I, and in his own name to, as if they
could derive that authority from him, that has no power (according to your
Ordinance) to leavie them in his own defense, though his person is in never so
apparent imminent danger; yet they for his good, and the good of the Kingdom,
can pretend to this power, and beyond, yet that all is not of that
infallibility, let Mr. Pims Letter from Sir John Hotham witness with me.

I have committed these few Observations, to the view of the Public, finding
so many bold Pamphlets (with so high impudence) fly at the face of Majesty
unreproved, and every corner stinks of this unclean Doctrine: yet since it is
come to this height, that we must declare our selves, or lose our King,:
wherein my purpose fails, my Life shall make good to my last Breath; but if
Religion, Reason, and Law had not warranted so Just a cause, I should never
have adventured to clear a Glass to so foul a countenance: yet before I
conclude, let me propose one Question in Religion: Whether the Church was not
in its purity in the Primitive times; the world agrees they had in those Days
a King that was no Christian? Whether Christ had not more power (then ever any
can or dare pretend to since) to eclipse that Regal Dignity, if it had been
distructive to the Church? yet He refused the lowest office of a Magistrate,
But gave to Caesar the things that were His, for when the young Man came to Him
and said, Lord command my Brother that he devide the Inheritance with me, He
Replies, who made me a Ruler or a Judge amongst You? But now, That we having a
Christian King, professing by his unblemisht Life, the same way to salvation
with us, protesting to conserve our Liberties with his Life, to make such an
apparent difference, which may be the occasion of the effusion of so much
Christion Blood, upon mere Iealousies, will be the most unheard of disloyalty
that can be committed to future Ages.
