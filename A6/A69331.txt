By the Queen.
THE Queens Majesty being given to understand, that chiefly through the
disorderly traffiquing of such her merchants as trade into France for wines,
the said wines are of late years grown to that excessive price, as for the
furnishing of the Realm of the same, there is yearly consumed a greater
portion of treasure, then in any times before has been, to the great
impouerishing of this her Realm: Has therefore (seeing the great inconvenience
that is like to increase and ensue thereof, if in time there be not some
speedye redress of the same,) by the advice of her Majesty's Counsel, thought
meet to declare to al manner of persons that shall use the trade of the
bringing in of the said wines into this Realm, that they forbear to bring
into any part of this Realm the said wines, unless they may utter and
afoorde the same after the rate of ten pounds the Tun, with all manner
ordinary charges, upon pain of imprisonment. And that any person that shall
buy any the said wine above the said rate, shall in respect of his contempt,
suffer imprysonment during her Majesty's pleasure, and forfeyte the said wine.

Given at Kyllyngworth the.xv. day of July. 1575. the xvii. year of her
Majesty's reign.
Imprinted at London by Newgate Market next unto Christ's Church, by Richard
Judge, Printer to the Queens Majesty.
