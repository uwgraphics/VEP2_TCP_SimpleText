A Proclamation, inhibiting the resort of His Majesty's people to the Court for
Cure of the Kings Evil, and to restrain the access of others from infected
places.
WHereas His MAJESTY by His Proclamation published about November last, did
inhibite His loving Subjects, That none of them should resort to his Majesty's,
or places to his Court adioining, for cure of the infirmity called The Kings
Evil, until the middle of Lent then following, and now past, which
signification of His Majesty's pleasure was made, upon advertisement received
from diverse parts of this Realm, of the dispersing of the Infection of the
Plague insundry places thereof. And sithence the middle of Lent last, His
Majesty has at sundry times admitted of such of His Subjects, as repaired unto
Him for Cure of that infirmity, to have access to His Person. Yet being given
to understand, that the said infection does again spread it self, His Majesty
does straightly inhibite all His loving Subjects, that none of them resort to His
Majesty, or places of His Court adjoining for Cure of the said infirmity,
until Christmas next: Charging all His Officers and Ministers whom it shall
concern, That they make stay of as many as they shall find traveling, or
preparing themselves to His Majesty for Cure of that infirmity, and to turn
them, as also all other persons whom they shall find to come from places
Infected to the places of their residence, not suffering them to approach to
His Majesty's presence, or His Court, or the Court or Household of His dearest
Consort the Queen, or of His Son the Prince, as they will avoid His
Majesty's displeasure, and the Pains of His Laws ordained against contemners
of His Command.

Given at the Court at Greenwich the twentieth day of June, in the eighth year
of the Reign of our most gracious Sovereign Lord, King CHARLES, of England,
Scotland, France and Ireland, defender of the Faith, etc.
