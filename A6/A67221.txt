A True DECLARATION concerning the surrender of BRIDGEVVATER.

Written by Coll. EDMOND VVYNDHAM,

To vindicate him from some false and scandalous reports, raised by some
malicious Adversaries.

Printed in the Year 1646.

IT is an old saying, that it is better to be fortunate then wise; I may truly
add in what concerns my self, with relation to the scandalls that are
thrown upon me, by the practice and malice of such as endeavor to traduce my
reputation, that it is better to be successful then honest. For the one I am
confident would have preserved me in a fair opinion and good esteem amongst
all men, whereas the other only continues my credit with those that personally
know me; and by that knowledge are confirmed in their belief of my integrity.
I did believe that my own innocence had been a sufficient shield to guard and
defend me from the malicious reports of my enemies, whose rumors being false,
and wanting the basis of truth, for their foundation, I imagined they would
quickly vanish and not prejudice my honor; and therefore I contemned and
despised them and their authors. But finding that these untrue suggestions,
although they have no color of truth, by the sly and subtle insinuations of
my adversaries, have gained credit with some noble personages, whose
satisfaction I desire: and also to vindicate my own reputation, lest silence
should conclude my guilt, I have thought fit and am persuaded by some friends,
to justify my self by this true relation, under my own hand of my behavior
in my command, which I shall maintain with my life, against the scandalls and
aspersions of all my adversaries. And I am the rather induced hereunto, because
I have now nothing left me, but my reputation, which in the cause I have
undertaken cannot truly be blemished. And I shall I hope by this Apology,
(although it be an inconvenience, that truth and honesty must be enforced
thereunto, whilst treachery and falsehood walk openly without check or
control) satisfy all ingenuous and honorably disposed persons, that it
remains yet spotless. For if I am guilty of any crime, it cannot be less in
betraying the trust reposed in me then treachery or cowardice, or both, and I
must justify my self that I am guilty of neither, but if my accusers had
been more moderate, and had laid to my charge, folly, rashness, or
indiscretion, I should have been so modest as not to have justified all my
actions: For I should have confessed that soldiery was not originally my
profession, and that I might be guilty of some such imperfections. But the
scandal of treason is of too venomous a nature to be digested; for it not
only destroys me, but dishonours my Family, and stains my Posterity. And
therefore to wipe away this blemish, I have put pen to paper, and do here
deliver the impartial truth of my proceedings, which if any man can
contradict, I shall desire no favor in their forbearance. I know well that
guilt is of the nature of filthy odours, who by stirring become more unsavory,
but virtue and integrity is of a contrary quality, which by sifting and
searching becomes the more pure and refined; and therefore in confidence of my
own innocence, I do publish this Declaration, wherein I do challenge all my
enemies to detect me, if I be guilty of any miscariage of so high a nature as
is laid to my charge, hoping hereby to make it appear that I am free and
clear from those black calumnies and slanders, which malice, envy, and
detraction have thrown upon me.

I confess that according to the dictates of my own conscience and reason,
and according unto the obligation I stood engaged unto his Majesty, as well by
my common allegiance, as by my more particular duty of personal service, in
the beginning of these unhappy differences and divisions of the Kingdom, I
engaged my self on his Majesty's party, wherein I have constantly persever'd
either in acting or suffering until this day; concurring with those of the
contrary party, only in hating detestable newtrality. According to my best
ability I did diligently execute all such Commissions as I did receive from his
Majesty, and in the place of Governor of Bridgewater, did use my utmost
endeavor to preserve that Town, and to retain the people in obedience to his
Majesty. But I, like other of his Majesty's Commanders, wanted the sinews of
War, and was enjoined a hard task, to make brick without straw, to
fortify a Town, victual it, leavy men, provide arms and ammunition, with all
things necessary for the defense thereof, without money to effect it. I
acknowledge I had an assignement of contribution, after long solicitation to a
fit proportion to do the work; but this was presently anticipated by
particular orders of my superior Officers, and by free quarterings, so that
very little money could be gathered by my Collectors, but all or the most part
was diverted into other chanells, especially of late for the maintenance of the
new erected Garrisons of Lamport and Burrowe. And the Lord Gorings horse by
their free quarter and trenchar money so impoverisht the Country, that for the
space of six months before the surrender of Bridgewater, I am assured I did
not receive three hundred pounds, I believe not two hundred pounds toward the
payment of my Garrison, and the furnishing of it with all things necessary for
the defense thereof. I did often complain of my wants, both to the Princes
Council, and to the superior Officers of his Majesty's armies, so that my
defects were apparently known unto them, yet could have no redress, until
the Country was possessed by the Parliaments forces, and then it was too late to
make use of those unprofitable graunts, which were as difficultly obtained, as
if they had been for my proper benefit, and not for his Majesty's use. And yet
during those last 6 months, I had my men, ammunition, and victuals, which I
had procured by my own expense and credit, commanded out of my Garrison, to
supply the army before Taunton, whilst it was under Sir R. Grenvil, and
afterward under my Lord Goring, which was promised to be restored, but the
performance came too slow. That the Town lay conveniently to be fortified is
most apparent, and that with expense it might have been made very strong is
most certain, but that it was so by the then made fortifications the contrary
is manifest through want of means to effect the same. For almost half the
Town which is called Eastover, when Sir Thomas Fairefax came before it, had
only a dike cast without any fashioning or turfing of the works, or forming
of the flankers, so that although the Graffe were a good defense in the
outside, yet the inside could hardly be made use of as a convenient brestworke.

But that which was most to my prejudice, was, that such soldiers as I had
raised in that County by my interest, were always commanded away out of my
Garrison; so that when the enemy came before the town, I had not above two
hundred and fifty of my old soldiers left in the town, besides townsmen, the
rest were made up by Pembrokeshire men, taken by my Lord Gerrard in that
County, and sent over to recruit Prince Ruperts Regiment after the battle of
Nazeby, and I had likewise some of Sir John Stawels regiment, and some few
soldiers belonging unto Bristoll Garrison, which were newly come from Lamport.
These came into the town not above three days before the enemy came before
it, and the Pembroke-shire men were such, for the most part, as had formerly
served the Parliament. They were in number about five hundred, and had the
guard of that part of the town, called Eastover, divided from the rest of the
town by the river, and were appointed to defend two third parts of that line;
the other third part being to be maintained by those of Sir John Stawells
regiment, and those Bristoll soldiers which came from Lamport; so that there
was in that part of the town about seven hundred soldiers, I having put more
men into it then into the other part of the town, because the line was not
perfected, and because Sir Thomas Fairfax with most of his horse and foot lay
on that side of the town; Major General Massey keeping guards on the other
side, where I had placed those of my own regiment, the townsmen, and some
volunteers. Most of these soldiers were upon the guard every night, doing
constant duty twelve nights together, and my self was continually with them all
that time, visiting one guard or other, all the night.

Friday, the 11th of July, Sir Thomas Fairfax drew near the town, and that
night and Saturday placed several guards within Musket shot of our works, and
so continued without advancing further until he stormed the town, which was
Monday morning the 21. of July, between one and two of the clock, at which time
he brought on two bridges to pass his men over the Graffe, which were so
narrow, that I believe not above two men could pass over abrest, and one of
these bridges sailed in the bringing on, so that if these Pembroke-shire men
had been stout and honest, it being their guard that he attempted to force, it
is apparent how fruitless his attempt must have proved. I was then in
Eastover, and as I conceived, did hear some noise of the enemies preparation
before they came on, and for the more certain discovery thereof, did send out
twenty musketeers under the command of a Sergeant, being drawn out of Prince
Ruperts regiment, who at their return, assured me, that the enemy moved not,
yet immediately after that, the enemy came on, and marched with their bridge
over Castlefield, where they had no shelter, from our shot, and if our men had
not been false, they must needs have done great execution upon them; but these
Pembrokeshire men, although they fired very well, did little or no execution on
the enemy; for they either shot over their heads when they shot bullets, or
else shot nothing but powder, as they themselves confessed after the town was
surrendered, upbraiding diverse Protestant Officers, calling them Papists, and
asking them, whether they believed that they would fight against the Parliament
to defend Papist Rogues?

And yet I am assured, that there was not one Papist that was an Officer within
the Garrison. At the same time that the enemy attempted Eastover, I hearing
great vollies of shot from the other side of the Town, conceiving that the
enemy might enter there, thinking this part secure, because it was so well
manned, having left a reserve of horse and foot on that side of the water, to be
ready on all occasions to second those who guarded the line, and to prevent the
enemies assaults, I rode with much haste round the line on the other side of
the town to encourage the townsmen, and to observe if there were any danger of
the enemies entering there; but before I could ride round the line, and return
into Eastover again, the Pembrookshire men had laid down their arms, and when I
came back, were helping the enemy over the works, and above forty of them
entered. Major Michel, who commanded in chief over that Regiment, being shot,
was carried off, and I found no Officer there, the reserve of foot, and most of
the horse being gone, only I espied at a distance, five or six horse, which
were most of them Officers, amongst them were L. Col. Jones, and Cornet Welsh,
whom I commanded to join with me, and to endeavor to beat out the enemy that
was entered, which they did, and we forced back the enemy to the top of the
work, where we could not charge them further, by reason of the steepness of
the bancks, where the enemy defended themselves with pikes, and our own men
mingled with the enemy, and fired upon us, and killed L. Col. Jones, being the
next man unto me: I perceiving that it was impossible with horse to beat the
enemy from that stand they made on the top of the works, wheeled about my
horse, intending to ride to the other side of the line, to command from thence
a party of Musketteers to force off the enemy; but when I came to cross the
street, I found that by the help of these treacherous villains, the drawbridge
was broken down, and the enemies horse entered into Eastover, so that I found
three were then so many of the enemies entered into that part of the town, that
it was impossible to beat them thence; whereupon I endeavored in the best
manner I could, to secure the retreat of as many soldiers as might be, out of
Eastover, into the other part of the town, beyond the river; but my soldiers
being in disorder, and confusion, the enemy coming on so fast, hindered diverse
that were endeavoring to get over the river, and some were slain, amongst
which L. Col. Glanvile was one, who escaped from the enemy at the fight at
Lamport, and came into the town, just as Sir Thomas Fairfax came before it. The
enemy immediately brought up their Cannon to force the drawbridge, which was
the passage over the river, and by the shelter of the houses, came within
Pistol-shot thereof, and before the chains were fastened, made some shot
through him, and killed and wounded some men, yet we secured the bridge; and
notwithstanding all their Cannon-shot, which played continually upon us, we
made two barrocadoes within the bridge, from whence I stird not, until I saw
those works perfected. The enemy that night had raised three other batteries,
the one in Castle-field, the other in the way going toward Taunton, and the
third, at the end of West-street; these played most part of the day into the
town, besides a Morter-piece, which they shot often out of Eastover. After we
had finished the works about the bridge, I having discovered where their Cannon
lay, which battered us there, I caused the wreathed Gun to be brought down to
that side of the town, and to be planted where I conceived it might most annoy
the enemy and beat them off from their Cannon, there being a Blind made and no
other security for their Gunners, which succeeded accordingly; for hereby we
not only beat them from that Gun, but also with this piece we battered Master
Harvies house and drove the enemy thence, which was a great safety unto us.
The enemy and we lay now only separated by the river, they having houses and
mudde walls on their side of the river, as useful for the safety of their
soldiers, as our works, houses, and mudde walls were unto us. Only their
walls had thatch of straw for their coverings, which we fired, and so made
them too warm for them, to make use of them that day. The river was fordable
at low water for horse and foot to pass over. I know not what apprehension the
enemy had, but that day about four of the clock in the afternoon, they
seemed to quit Eastover in some disorder, and drew off their Guns from their
battery in Castle Field, and fired that part of the Town they were possessed
off, whereupon we sallied, and seized their Cannon wherewith they battered the
drawe-bridge, and we took diverse arms they had left behind them, and brought
them into the Town, but wanted conveniencie to draw off their Cannon, because
we had barrowcadoed the bridge. But within a short time the enemy returned,
and placed their guardes again in Eastover. By this storm we had lost at
least six hundred soldiers, all the Welsh being turned to serve the enemy
except about forty, which were in the inner Townemost of Sir John Stawells
Regiment, and the Bristoll soldiers were taken prisoners, so that I had
remaining about five hundred soldiers and townsmen, that bore arms, the rest
being lost in the storm of Eastover, besides we lost two iron Guns, some
ammunition and provision. Notwithstanding this loss I so encouraged those
soldiers I had left, telling them that now the traitors were gone, we should
be the more secure, having none but such as were faithful remaining, and as we
had fewer soldiers, so we had less ground to defend. That night we wrought
very hard to line our thin works, and to raise Blinds to prevent the enemy
out of Eastover, who might else in diverse places command the inside of our
Curtains. The next morning being Tuesday about the same hour that the enemy
stormed us, the day before, they attempted us again, but with no success,
their soldiers not daring to assault our works, but shouting very hard at
distance, at length retreated without gaining any advantage, which was a great
encouragement to my soldiers, being now confident, that the enemy durst not
attempt our works, and that what they did the day before was by intelligence
with the Pembroke-shire men.

That afternoon about two of the clock Sir Thomas Fairefax sent his third and
last summons for the surrender of the Town, to which I returned a positive
refusal. Immediately after a house was fired toward the west part of the
Town, and I going to give order for the quenching thereof, had not staid long
but news was brought that the Town was fired in diverse other places, and some
boys apprehended who were actors therein, confessing that they had been hired
to do it by some of the Pembroke-shire soldiers. A Livetenant likewise was
taken endeavoring as was pretended to fire the Church, conceiving the Magazine
had been there: The boys confession was a certain proof, but the evidence
against the Livetenant was not so clear. A house was likewise fired where the
Gunners kept all their case and round shot, and such other ammunition as was
prepared for our Ordnance, and likewise most of our match was there consumed,
in short the fire grew so great and terrible that the Town seemed all of one
flame. Those houses that were fired near the line, made the place too hot and
dangerous for any soldiers to abide there: the townsmen all ran off their
guards to secure their goods and houses, and drew off with them diverse
soldiers, by giving them money to assist them therein: So that the lines were
generally quitted, the Town likely to be burnt all to ashes, the enemy ready
to assault us, and few or none could be gotten to make defense, most of our
provision and ammunition burnt and destroyed by the fire: And the most part of
the soldiers and people crying out to make conditions; whereupon I called a
Council of war, and by the advice of all or far the greater part of the
Officers that were there present, I bekeve I may truly say by all of them that
were then there, it was thought fit to send unto Sir Thomas Fairfax for
conditions, which with much importunity I was persuaded to do, after some of
the chief Officers and Soldiers of the Garrison had by the appointment of the
Council of war viewed the Town and returned answer that it was not possible
to be held.

All that were then present can bear me witness, with what difficulty I was
persuaded to hearken unto conditions, and what industry I used to encourage the
soldiers to defend it, but I have been since told by some of good credit, that
there were others as solicitous to dissuade them from it, being more studious
to preserve their lives then their honors, telling the townsmen and the
soldiers, that there was no reason, now that they might have conditions, that
they should all sacrifice their lives, to satisfy the rashness of the
Governor, who it may be, could not find means to reconcile himself to the
Parliament; but for them, their offenses were not so great, but that they might
make satisfaction, which most of them have since done; and after their coming
unto London, were quickly released; by which persuasions, and other
discouragements, especially that of the fire, the whole town being probable to
be burnt down to the ground, and most of the ammunition and provision being
already consumed, there was a necessity of yielding the town, and of accepting
such Articles as the General would give us, he having intelligence of our
condition, and understanding it as well as our selves, both soldiers and
inhabitants pressing me thereunto, disserting their guards, and applying
themselves wholly to exstinguish the fire, which now seemed to overspread the
whole town. Whereupon it was agreed, that we should draw up Articles such as we
intended to yield the town upon, and send them unto the General, which was
accordingly done, and Mr. Ellyot sent with them, who immediately returned, with
other Articles, subscribed by Sir Thomas Fairfax, which were such as afterward
we were enforced to surrender the town upon; by which, both officers and
soldiers became prisoners, to which I returned answer by Sir Jo. Hele, and Mr.
Ellyot, that we would not accept those conditions, and that unless we might
have our liberties, we were resolved to abide the greatest extremity, and so
gave order that the parley should break off. And I endeavored in the mean
time, to draw men to the works, for the defense of the town; but whilst I was
endevoring to draw men to the line, Mr. Ellyot returned with a positive denial
from the General, that he would give no other conditions; whereupon it was
unanimously resolved by all the Officers and Gentlemen present, that we should
accept those conditions offered by Sir Thomas Fairfax. And I appeal unto all,
who were at the meeting and transacting of the treaty, whether, when it was
objected by such Officers and Commissioners as were present, that I should be
held guilty of all the blood that should be afterward spilt, if I accepted not
the conditions; and whether they did not demand what I would fight for, or what
I would defend, for the town would be consumed unto ashes; and whether my
answer were not, that I would fight for my liberty, or to have an honorable
Sepulture in those ashes, but my persuasions could not prevail with them, for
all unanimously pressed me to the yielding up of the town; this is the truth,
which I will justify, concerning the delivering up of the town of Bridgewater,
wherein I will appeal to all who were there present, whether I did ever absent
my self out of apprehension of danger, or did not on all occasions show my self
ready to express my duty and my loyalty with the hazard of my life.

And whereas it has been objected, that I sold the town, I defy all the
world, to prove that ever I held any correspondence or intelligence with the
enemy, or ever received any favor or friendship from the Parliament, or their
Army; nay, I have been so tender in seeking to the Parliament for any of those
things which they ordinarily afford to men in my condition, that I have forborne
to sue for them, fearing, that those, who on no probable ground are so bold to
scandal me, would easily be induced to misconstrue both our intentions, and
interpret civilities disguised corruptions. I confess, after the surrender of
the town, I was civilly treated by the General, and some of his Officers, and
out of that civility, I am confident they will vindicate me from all these
aspersions, if they be required thereunto. I lost all I had in the town, which
in goods and housholdstuffe, I am sure was of a considerable value, not
preserving so much as mine, my wifes, or childrens clothes, which indeed were
allowed us by the General, but after taken away by the Committee; and for
ready money, the General allowed me to carry out thirty pounds, but truly I
had not ten pounds when I left the town, but was enforced to borrow money to
bring me to London, for I spent not only what I had allowed from his Majesty,
but mine own revenue was employed in that service, as those who kept my
accounts can clearly justify, besides what I borrowed and engaged my self, to
satisfy for the public service.

There was never any rational man that was corrupt, but it was for some end or
advantage, I am sure I could have none in it, for I lost all that I had in the
world, not preserving a peniworth of any goods; nor had I any conditions for my
other estate, which has been ever since in sequestration. This justification I
offer to the view of the world, and do challenge all my adversaries to produce
but a single circumstance to make their scandalls probable, which if they shall
offer any, I shall not doubt, but by the testimony of persons of honor,
clearly to convince their malice. All that I shall hereby desire, is, that
having in this adventure lost all my estate, I may by the candor of those that
read it, be preserved in my reputation, and then, although few begreater
sufferers then my self, yet none shall be more contented, because in the whole
progress of this business, I did nothing with relation to the trust reposed
in me, that awakens my conscience to repentance.

FINIS.
