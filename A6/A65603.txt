What if the KING should come to the City?
More questions concerning new matters of weight,
Being some of those humors which many conceit,
Being lately composed in a pleasant new Ditty,
What if the King should come to the City.




WHat if the King should come to the City,
how would he be entertained I trow?
With triumph and joy with rigor or pity,
Many conjecture and some do know
Would not the Turn-pike Captain then
guard his great shot
for fear of a Plot.
and lock up his Wickets
whilst he studies
to secure his Guns and his men.
Will not the Troop of riders in Scarlet
humbly stoop at his Majesty's feet
Believe it who list for me he is a varlet
that credits a miracle before he see it
will they not rather
ask him whither
he means to persist
and do what he list
Or to join with his Parliament and Assembly
When they are all agreed together.
will not your Schismatic shopkepers mutter
professing in verity they are undone
and cannot for a King their commoditys utter
wishing him beyond Ierico or the Moon
Will not they boldly give it out
that all this toil
is only to spoil
and rout out the purity
of the blessed Reformation
they were late about.
Will not your Tafity Pioners riot;
I mean those dainty Citizens wives,
That deep in their trenches left husband and diet
to save their own and Childrens lives:
will not they murmur
at this Cross,
did we go about
to keep the King out,
And you to let him and his Ruffins enter
our precious wares to tumble and toss.
The second part,
to the same tune.




HOw stands ye opinions of such as did grumble
that they should be governed under a King,
Will they be contented themselves for to humble,
unto their dread Sovereign in every thing,
Or will they not rather seem to be
more obstinate,
*against him and the State,
so much that others
boldly profess
themselves to be King as well as he,
Will not the numerous multitude meet him
to see his returning home again,
Or rather the chief of the City to greet him.
and in Royal manner his Grace entertain,
And shall not the factions then forbear,
whose brains are so weak
that still they must speak
forth Treason against
his Royal Person
else can they not live contented here.
Will not the Royallists frame their Petitions,
and humbly desire his Grace to consent
And that he would sign to all good Propositions,
and also agree with his great Parliament.
Whereby to release them from those Banns
which they for his sake
upon them did take,
and that they after
may have such freedom
as freely to enjoy their goods and their lands.
The Prentices they which do monthly desire
a day for their recreation to take,
Now at his returning perhaps will require
a barter and all for his Majesty's sake,
And though they allow two days for one,
yet they will be content,
and think it well spent,
when as they behold
his Majesty settled
in Peace and Dignity upon his Throne.
Thus in the conclusion to so wrap up the story,
to think that the King and the State will agree.
Good men will be glad though knavs may be sorry
but hang up all such as is sorry for me,
For this shall ever be my Prayer,
God prosper and bless
the King and all his,
and eke the Parliament,
which endeavors
daily to keep this Land from all care.
Printed in the Year 1660.
