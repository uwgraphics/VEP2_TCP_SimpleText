A VISITATION OF Heavenly Love UNTO The SEED of JACOB yet in Captivity; to whom
the Love of the Lord is, who is Gathering, and will Gather it, for it belongs
unto Him.
THe Shout of a King is gone forth out of his holy Mountain, and the voice of a
Mighty Prophet is descending through the earth, whose voice is as a mighty
Thunder, Sounding forth the Day of the Lord God which is at hand; and the voice
of the terrible God is heard in his Holy Mountain, at the sound of which, the
inhabitants of the earth Fear and Tremble, for the word of the Lord God is
quick and powerful, and this descends with a voice of terror to the wicked, and
this speaks not peace to the ungodly, but the voice of our beloved is
terrible unto the unrighteous part.

And in that day wherein God appears first, is a day of bitter Lamentation;
and this all men must know, before they know him that brings Salvation; for
as the lightning comes out of the East, and shines to the West, even so is
the coming of the Son of Man in this the day of his Power; whose coming is
already known, who is come to Judgment, and to Judge both the Quick and the
Dead, and to Raise to Life again, that which has been Dead; for Death has
reigned over all men from Adam until Moses, and Moses served God, and he was a
Servant, and yet a Prophet, and he Prophesied, and he talked with God in the
Holy Mount that burned with fire, out of which fire God Spoke; And he that
dwells in Everlasting Burnings, has now revealed his Will by his own Son,
that he has manifested in his people; for now God has revealed his Son in
these last days, as in Generations past; and he that Reveals the Will of the
Father, dwells in him, and the fullness of the Father dwells in the Son; And
he that has the Son, has the Father also: And this is he that has brought
Salvation by his own Arm of Power; and this is he that came down from Above,
which is the the Living Bread of Life, the Living Word, by which the Heavens
were Created, and the Earth was Formed, the Word became Flesh, and it dwelt in
the Sons of Men; the Word that quickens, and gives life into the Soul, the
living Virtue that God Breaths forth upon his own begotten: The Living
Nourishment that descendes down daily, is only that which gives Life, the Word
of Life, that Nourishes up unto Eternal Life.

And so all are to come to the Word of Life in themselves, the Word that
begets again out of Transgression, which Word leads again unto the Father,
and Renews all that do Believe, into his Heavenly Image, and Divine nature of
Love, as before the World began; for God is now bringing forth his own
Likeness, and his own Image, in his Sons and Daughters; and he is Creating a
New in Christ Jesus, all that do believe.

And so that which was before the World began, God is bringing forth, and this
must endure for ever, when the world shall be no more; and so to the end of the
world all must come to that which was in the beginning; he is the Beginning and
the End; the First and the Last.

And so the end of all things is at hand; and all must come to know an end of
the first Covenant which was made with Hell and Death, which Christ, the
everlasting Covenant of Life, and of Light, is come to break and and make void;
and he was given for a Light unto the Gentiles, and to be Gods Salvation unto
the ends of the Earth; and so he that believes in the Covenant of Life, is
lead again unto God

This is the acceptable Day of the Lord God, wherein he is come to gather
together his Remnant, and to seek the lost Sheep of the House of Israel; and
this is to all, who are yet scattered upon the barren Mountains, who are
seeking rest; the Lord God of Heaven, and of Earth is calling out of his holy
Mountains, and the Trumpet of the Lord God is sounding, to gather the Nations
together, that they may come in again unto the Shepherd of Israel; who feeds
his Sheep himself with indurable bread of life, who waters them with the
Rivers of his pleasure, who has se^ the Fountain open, whose Streams are as
clear as Crystal, and out of the Throne of God the do proceed: So all come to
the Fountain of Life, the Lord God is now opening freely, and is giving
abundantly of his Heavenly Treasure, and he is filling of his Vessels with new
Wine, and he is pouring forth of his Spirit upon his Sons and Daughters: and
this is the day of the Lord God wherein he is fulfilling his promise, and many
can seal unto it; for this is the glorious day wherein the Lord God has now
appeared in excellent brightness, as the breaking forth of the morning, even so
is the Lord God appearing; at whose appearance, the Clouds of the night fly,
for the Kingdom of God is revealing; which Kingdom consists in
righteousness, and in peace and Joy in the holy Ghost: For Life and
Immortallity is brought to Light, through the Gospel which has been preached,
and glad tidings is come upon the Mountains of Israel, and an Alarm is sounded
out of Sion, the holy City, the City of the living God, new Jerusalem is come
down from Heaven, and all Nations are flowing unto Her, and into the Lords Holy
Mountain many must be gathered, for the Mountain of the Lord shall be called
the Mountain of Holiness, in which he will dwell for ever, and upon Mount Sion
our King shall reign, and of his Government there shall be no end; and this is
the Name they shall call him, The Lord our righteousness.

For this is the great Day of the Lord God, wherein he is come near unto
Judgment, and to gather together all Nations on the face of the whole Earth,
and to plead with them by the Sword of his Power; and all must know the Sword
of the Lord God, to make a separation in their own particulars; they must know
the Word that divides between the clean and the unclean: For verily, there is
no coming to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Life, but as all come to feel the
Sword of the Lord God to pass through their own particulars; for the Sword is
placed to keep the way of the Tree of Life, so that none can come at it, but
such as pass through death; and so there is a passage through Death unto Life;
and so blessed are all they that Dye in the Lord, that have a part in the first
Resurrection, on whom the second death has no power; there is no Condemnation
to those who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
Spirit; so he that is crucified with Christ, must reign with him in glory: so
all must come to that eternal power that crucifieth the deeds of the Body,
that mortifieth the Corruptions; for the fire of the Lord God must pass
through the earth, to burn up all Stubble, and Briars, and Brambles that have
grown there; for the Earth must be dissolved by fire, and the old Heavens must
pass away with a great noise, and the Cup of Trembling must be Drunken, and
the Cup of astonishment must be received from the hand of the Lord God; for he
will pour out his anger upon his Enemies, and all that which lets, he will
take it out of the way; for the Lord God is come to remove the Mountains, and
the Hills tremble before him, and the Sword of his Power is in his hand, and he
is come to plead with the Nations: And thus says the Lord of Host, the Mighty
and Terrible God, I am riding swiftly to Battle. I am come to overturn all
lofty Mountains, and to lay low all High Places, and to gather together all
Potsherds of the Earth, and to dash them one against another; for the Decree of
God is gone forth against this Generation, and the Controversy of the Lord is
against them, and another overturning is at hand, the Lord of Host has spoken
it, and it shall come to pass in the Lords Season: For the Lord has decreed
to shake terribly the Earth, that that which cannot be shaken may reign on the
top of all: and this is the Day of the Lord God, in which he is come to Rule in
the Kingdoms of Men: For Kingdoms shall rise against Kingdoms, and Nation
against Nation; and there shall be Wars and Rumors of Wars in the Earth; mark,
in the Earth: All must come to know this, for the warfare of the Lamb is begun,
and Michaell our Prince is Warring with the Dragon and his Power, and he in
Heaven, and he that has an ear to hear, let him hear: For the Dragon must
be cast into the Earth; then woe unto the Earth, and the Sea: For the Devil is
come down, which rages exceedingly, because he knows he has but a short
time; for after he is thrown out of Heaven into the Earth, and the Sea, then he
has but a short time: And then the Dragon throws out his Floods after the
Man-Child; and the Sea rages, and the earth is troubled, and there is woe upon
the earth; and this must be known in that day, when the Lord leads Israel out
of Egypt, unto the Land of Rest, Canaan, that blessed Land which flows with
milk and honey, the Lord God is bringing of many thither: And he is gathering
of a Remnant from all Countries, and the sound of the glorious Gospel of Christ
has reached throughout the Earth; at the sound of which all Nations are
gathering together, and the Voice of the Living God is gone forth out of his
holy Mountain, by which he has called to all on the face of the whole Earth to
come again, and return into the Fathers house; and now is the Prodigal saying,
I will return in again into my Fathers house: For behold, the hired Servants
has bread enough in the Fathers house, and all that have been scattered, and
are scattered, and driven out from God, to such, I say return, return, for this
is the day of the Lord God, wherein he is come to seek, and to gather his
scattered Sheep, who are yet upon the barren Mountains, and he is gathering in
again into the holy Mountain where he dwells himself, and all must come to
know the habitation where God dwells, which is holy, and undefiled; thus is
the Living God Purifying his Temples; and he is making a Glorious Situation, a
Heavenly Habitation, and an Everlasting dwelling place in the Sons and
Daughters of Men; for God is now come to dwell in his people, as he has said,
I will dwell in them, and I will walk in them, and a people has God chosen to
dwell in, and this is Gods everlasting day of loving kindness, and of free
Salvation; and this day is breaking through the dark cloudy night that has
been over all Nations; the day springs from on high, to visit them that sit
in Darkness, and in the Region and Shadow of Death; for now the Lord God has
Commanded the Light to Shine out of Darkness, which Light is breaking through
in a more clearer Manifestation then it has in all Generations past; and the
Glorious Lord has now appeared in more Excellent brightness, and more is his
Glory seen then in the days of Old: For as the waters cover the Sea, even so
the Glory of the Lord covers the Earth: And this is the begotten of the
Father, full of Grace and Truth; its full, for a full Fountain the Lord God
has set open, out of which flows Heavenly Treasures, out of which flows
the Springs of Life, and Salvation; and the Lord is Showring down his Heavenly
Dewes upon his Garden, his Paradise; for the Lord God has again planted his
Vineyard upon a high and fruitful Mountain, as in the beginning; and he is
watering of it with the Springs of his Pleasure, and of the Heavenly Dew he
sends down into the low Valleys, whereby the City of God comes to rejoice;
and Heaven and Earth is filled with the good Treasure of God; for God is
pouring in of New Wine into his New vessels; for God is giving freely and
abundantly, unto all that do believe in his Name, He that believes in me,
says Christ, In him shall be a Well of Water, springing up unto Eternal Life;
and out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of Living Water: And this is known in
all that do believe. And from the feeling sense of the working Power of God,
and from his own Manifestation I do declare the Truth by the Revelation of the
Word of Life. And a greater then Solomon is come; and God has Revealed the Son
of his Love, the Eternal Power, the Wisdom of the Father; and this from him is
given, by the flowings in of the Power of Life. Given forth for this end to be
sent abroad.

The Powerful, and Eternal Word of the Lord came unto me the 26 day of the 9th
month, which word ran through me, which word was as a flame of Fire: and thus
says the Lord God, The holy one of Israel, the mighty God of Jacob; for the
shout of a King is gone through the earth, and the mighty day of the Lord God
is come, in which he has made his Eternal power Manifest; and the glorious
voice of the Lord has Preached into the uttermost parts of the Earth, and the
Revelation of Jesus Christ, the power of God is Revealed in such as fear the
Lord; and his Secrets are Revealed to them that fear him; and this is the day
of the Lord God, wherein he is come to Reveal his Will in his people; whose
Will is their Sanctification, and to all that do Believe in the Light of the
Lord God, and dwell in it; such know the Sanctifying, and the washing by the
Blood of Jesus; and such know the Regenerating, and the renewing by which they
are baptized into the Death of Christ; and such know the Dying, and such know
the Baptism by the Holy Ghost, and by Fire: And this is the Blood of
Sprinkling, whereby the Heart comes to be washed, and the Conscience purged
from dead works again to serve the Living God.

And this is the Baptism that all are to come unto, to know the purging, and to
purify by the Spirit of Judgment, and by the Spirit of burning, and this is
the Lord bringing many unto; the Living Word, which is quick and powerful,
which is living and eternal; which word works, and operateth, and creates a
new Heaven, and a new Earth, wherein the Righteousness of God is revealed, and
that Living and Eternal Power of God works continually in all who walk in
the Light: For the flying Angel is gone forth, having the everlasting Gospel
to Preach to all that dwell on the Earth, crying with a loud voice, and saying,
Fear God, and give Glory to his Name, for the hour of his Judgments are come
on the Earth. And the Lord God is come not to bring Peace, but a Sword, and the
Sword of the Lord Jehovah is drawn, to cut down and destroy the Man of Sin. And
the Lord God is setting fire on the earth, to burn up the fruitless Branches
thereof, and to Consume the Root and Ground, out of which the evil fruits have
been brought forth; and all must feel the fire, and the Sword of the Lord God,
which is more Sharper then any two edged Sword, and this must pass through the
Hearts of all; and this must separate between that which is holy, and from that
which is not holy: For the Living God is come to sit as a Refiners Fire, and
like Fullers Soap, and he is Purifying and Purging his Temple, that he alone
may rule and reign therein; and all that is not like unto God he will burn up,
and all men's works are to be tried by fire; and all that will not endure the
fire, God will not five: For the Hour and Day of Great Tribulation is at hand,
wherein God will try the Hearts of all, and of his own Dear Children; I say the
Hour of Trial is at hand, and blessed are they that indureth to the end, the
same shall be saved* For the Lord will once more shake the Kingdoms of the
Earth, and that terribly, and not the Earth only, but the Heavens also; and
the time of shaking is at hand, and the day draws nigh, wherein all shall be
scattered every one to his own: and then Blessed will they be, and Crowned for
ever, with Immortallity, and with Life, that dwell in God, that indureth the
Trial, and the Hour of Temptation which must come upon all flesh: And such as
endure to the end, God will gather together in that Day, when he binds up his
Jewels: Then shall he spare them as a Man spares his only Son that serves
him, and God will Crown his own with Honor and Dominion, in the sight of all
the World: Therefore lift up your Heads all ye that believe, and shout for joy,
and with one consent give praises to God; and Rejoice ye Heavens, and all that
dwell therein, for a shout of a great King is going before his Host, and the
Lamb is come to reign in his Eternal power over all the World, and in his
great Dominion Hallelujah and everlasting praises, and eternal glory be
sounded forth out of his Holy Mountain, praises, praises, for ever and ever be
unto the Lamb.

D. W.
