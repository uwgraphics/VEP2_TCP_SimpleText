Printers to the King and Queens most Excellent Majesty's. 1692/3.

His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT.
May Lords and Gentlemen,
THE large Supplies which you have given Me this Session, are so great
Testimonies of your good Affections, that I take this Occasion with great
Willingness to Return My hearty Thanks to you; And I Assure you it shall be My
Care to see that that Money you have Given, may be Effectually Applied to such
Services as may be most for the Honor and Interest of England.

I must Recommend to your Care the Peace and Quiet of the several Counties to
which you are now Returning, and Doubt not but by your Care, the Supply which
you have so freely Given, will not only be Effectually Levied, but with the
greatest Equality too, and the least Uneasiness to the People that is possible.

My Lords and Gentlemen,
The Posture of Affairs does necessarily Require My Presence Abroad; but I
shall take Care to leave such a Number of Troops here, as may be sufficient for
the Security of the Kingdom, against any Attempts of Our Enemies.

I shall add no more, but that as I shall continue to Expose My Own Person upon
all Occasions for the Good and Advantage of these Kingdoms, so I do likewise
Assure you, that My Hearty and Sincere Endeavors shall never be wanting in any
other kind, to make this a Great and Flourishing Nation.

Then the Speaker, by His Majesty's Command, said,
My Lords and Gentlemen,
IT is His Majesty's Pleasure, that this Parliament shall be Prorogued to the
Second Day of May next, and this Parliament is Prorogued accordingly to the
Second Day of May next.

FINIS.
