co^solations for the / wha^ so ever thou will resort unto it in thine aduersyty
with a thursty sto make. For here be co^pe^diously gathered together / the
things that paraue^ture thou might seek after in the Bible a great while.
And here thou may soon. Find where with thou shall be able / not only to
cure thine own wou^des / but also to re comfort thy neighbor being fallen i^
to any aduersyte. And more over to make strong and encourage ye feebleness of
man's conscience / with these most delectable scriptures of the great mercy of
god. For all consolation or comfort of man / shall savor but little in the /
after y^ thou have ones tasted of this: thy phisi. non / thy wife / thy
pare^tes and friends do promise the nothing but body ly health / and put the in
hope of len^er life / but the word of god does put the in hope of the life
everlasting / and causes the to sustain the hand of god with all pacy^ce and
to withstand the fear of death with a bold courage / even as it were with a
strong butwarke. wherefore most (gentell reder) I beseech the to take in worth
this work (such as it is) being bestowed only t^ thy use / and leauyng all
co^tagious ^ pudels / that may infeete thy mi^d with error / heresye / and
scdycio^ drink largely out of this vncorrupt and pure well of our sauiou^ the
knowledge of his high mercy And in the mean time consider how much thou art
bound to ^ chew these two euyls / whereof the prophet Hieremy does speak ^

THe spirit of the lord is upon Es^i^. 16.

conforte the sorrowful / for to glad the mourners of Spou / and to give a
crown for duste / the oil of joy for heaviness / the garment of praise / for
the spirit of sorrow.

I have trodden the press alone / and Esaia. 63. Esaia. 50
none of the people was with me.

I offer^d my body to the smyters and my chekes to the beters / I turned not my
face from the rebuckers ^ such as did spytte upon me / the lord god was my
defender / and I was not confounded.

I am Alpha and ^o / the beginnynge Apo. 1.
and ending / which am / and was / and shall be ever to come / almyghtye.

Do not fear I am the first and the last / and am a live and was deed / an^

I am the root and generation Apoc. 22.

come / and he that will / let hi^ take water of life freely.

who soever dri^keth of the wate Io. 4.
that I shall give hi^ / shall never b^ more thurst / but the water yt I sha
give / shall be in him a well of wate^ springi^g v^ in to everlasting life if
any be a thurst / let him come t^ Io. 7.
me and drink. who yt believes in m^ (as the scripture says) out of hibely /
shall flow the water of life

I am the breed of life / he that c^meth Io. 6.
unto me shall not hu^gre / an he that believes in me / shall neue^ be s

My flesh is very meat / and m^ blood is very dri^ke: He that ete^ my
flesh and drink my blood^ dwells in me and I in him.

I am the vine and you the bra^che^ Io. 15.
he that abides in me and I in him / brings forth much fruit / for without
me ye can do nothing. etc.

Abide in me / and I in you / for as the bra^che can bring forth no fruit of it
self / except it remain in the vync / no more can you except you remain in me.

If you abide in me / and my words abide in you also / ask what so ever ye
will / and it shall be granted you.

All that my father does give me / Io. 6.
shall come unto me / and who that comes unto me / I will not cast him away.

Come unto me all you that labor and are laden / and I will case you / take
my yoke on you and learn of me / for I am meke and lowly wherte / and you shall
find ease unto your souls / for my yoke is casy and my burden is light.

This is my commandment that Io. 51.
you shall love together / like as I have loved you: and gretter love tha^ this
can no man have / than to spe^de his life for his friends.

you ar my friends / if you do tha^ I command you.

ye have not chosen me / but I have Ioa^. 15
chosen you.

My father him self loves you Io. 16.
because you have loved me and hau^ Io. 16.
belyued that I came from god.

who soever does the will of my Ma. 12
father which is in heaven / is my br^ther / and sister / and mother.

This truly / is the will of my father Ioa^. 9.
that sent me / that every ou^ that sees the son / and does belyue in him /
shall have everlasting life / and I will stir him up a^ the later day.

Truly truly I say unto you / h^ that believes in me / has everlasting life.

He that loves me / shall be loue^ Io. 14
of my father / and I will love him / ^ show my self unto him.

If any do love me he will keep m^ word / and my father will love hi^ and we
will come unto him / an^ will make our mansyon in him.

If you do love me / keep my co^ma^ demetres / and I will pray unto my father /
and he shall give you another co^solatio^ for to abide with you ever more /
which is ye spirit of troth.

I will not leave you co^fortles / for I will come unto you.

And if I depart to prepare you a place / I will come again and will receive
you unto me / and where as I am you shall be*

I do leave peace with you / I give my peace unto you / I do not give unto you as
ye world does / let not your heart be troubled nor be aferd you shall be
oppressed in y^ world Io. 16.
but trust ye I have rq^red ye world O? ye endewed with small faith / Mat. 8
why are ye aferde.

Be of good chere (it is I) be not Ma 14
aferde.

Be ye nothing aferde my little Luc. 12
flock / for it has plesed our fader to give unto you the kingdom.

It is not the will of your father Ma 14
which is in heaven / that any of these lytellons should peryshe.

The son of god came down to Luc. 9
save / that that was lost.

The son of god came down na^ to lose souls / but to save.

God did not send his son i^ Ioa^. 3.
to the world for to judge the world / but to then tent that the world should
be saved by him.

He that believes in hi shall not b^ conde^pned / but he yt does not believe is
conde^pned already / bycaus^ he has not believed in the name o^ the only
begotten son of god / the father loves the son and has giu^ him all
things in his hand.

He that believes in the son hat^ everlasting life / and he that dot^ not
believe in the son shall neue^ se life / but the be^geaunce of go^ abides on
him.

I am the resurrection and life / wh^ Ioa^. 11
so ever beilueth on me / ye / thoug^ he were deed yet shall he live / an^ who
soever lives and believes i^ me / shall never dye.

I am the light of ye world / wh^ Ioa^.
y^ follows me walks not in da^kenes / but shall have yt light of life.

If any will serve me / let him follow Ioa^. 12
me / and where soever I am there shall my servant be / if any will ser^e me /
my father will honor him walk^ while you have light / that the darkness do not
take you.

whylest yo have the light / believe in the light / that you may be the children
of light.

I am the way / the truth / and the Io. 14
^yfe / no man comes to the father but by me.

I am ye door / who that comes in Io. 10.
^y me shall be saved / and shall go in / ^ shall go out / and shall fide
pastures.

I am a good shepherde / a good ^hepeherede gives his soul for ^is sheep.

I came that they should have life / ^ should have it more ple^tuously.

My sheep here my voice / and I do ^nowe the^ / and they follow me / and I ^yue
everlasting life to them / and ^hey shall never perisshe / and none ^all take
the^ out of my hand / my ^ather that gave me them is mightyer than all other /
and there is non^ able to take out of my faders ha^d^ I and the fader be all
one.

And / if I be left up from the earth Io. 12.
I will bring all unto me.

And like as Moses did ha^ge up Ioa^. 3.
a serpent in wyldernes / so must the son of man be hanged up yt who so ever
does believe shall not perish but shall have the life euerlastig.

For god has loved the world^ in such wise / that he gave his only begotten
son for the world that who soever belyued in him should not perish / but
should hau^ everlasting life.

Truly truly I say unto you / tha Io. 5.
who soever hereth my word / an^ believes in him that sete me / has
everlasting life / and shall not com^ into judgment / but shall pass fr^ death
unto life.

Blessed be they that here the wo^de Luc. 11
of god / and keep it.

Truly truly I say unto you / ^ Ioa^. 8.
there be any that will kepem word / he shall ^euer see death.

If you will abide in my word / verily you shall be my dyscyples / and you
shall know the truth / and the truth shall deliver you.

Heaven and earth shall pass / but Ma 14
my words shall never pass.

Blessed be the poor in spirit / Ma. 5.
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

Blessed be y^ meke / for they shall possess the earth.

Blessed be they that morn / for they shall be conforted.

Blessed be they yt hungre and thurst aft justice / for they shall be satisfied
Blessed be the merciful / for they shall obtain mercy.

Blessed be the pure in heart / for they shall see god.

Blessed be the peasable / for they shall be called the children of god.

Blessed be they that suffer persecution for rightwisenesse / for theirs is the
kingdom of heuyn.

Blessed are you / when that men do say yuell unto you / and do pursue you /
and do speak all evil against you / lyeng by cause of me / rejoice and be
glad / for your reward is great in heuyn.

And the least here of your hedde Luc. 12
shall not perissh / for through your patience you shall wyn your souls

Are not two sparous sold for a Mat. x
ferthyug? and none of them does fall on the grownde without your father / for
all y^ here is of your head be nombred / fear ye not therefore / year of more
value than many sparowes / who soever therefore thy I knoledge me before men / I
will know hi before my father y^ is in heuyn / but who soever will deny me
before men / him will I deny before my father which is in heaven.

All manner of sin and blaspheme Mat 12
shall be forgyuen unto men / but y^ blaspheyme ayenst-the holy ghost shall
never be forgyuen.

The gospel is preched to y^ pore Mat 11
and blessed is he that is not offended in me.

The time is fulfilled / and the Mat. 1
kingdom of god shall draw next / repent therefore and believe the gospel. who
soever y^ forsakes his house Ma 19
or brother / or systers / or father or mother / or wife / or children / or his
lands / for my name sake / shall ^cceyue an hundred time somoch / and shall
inherit everlasting life.

Retoyce by cause your names be Luc. 10
written in heuyn.

I say unto you / that asmoche joy Luc. 15
shall be in heu^n for one sinner taking repentance / as for nyntye and nine
rightwyse men that need not to repent.

Sucht as be in health / need no physycion Mat. 6
/ but such as be yuel at case.

I regard mercy / and not sacryce. for I am not come to call the ryghtwyse /
but sinners.

The son of god is come to seek Luc. 19
and to save that / that was lost.

I am not come for to condemn Io^. 12
the world / but to save the world

The son of god came not to be served / but for to serve and to spend his
life for ye redemption of many. Ma 20


I truly am in the mids of you / even as he that serves.

I give unto you a new commandment Io. 13.
/ y^ you shall love together like as I have loved you / to then tent y^ you
shall love one another: thereby shall every man know that you are my discyples /
if you will bear love one to another.

For if you will forgive me^ their Mat. 6
sins / your celesty all father shall forgive you / your fautes.

The thiges y^ be impossyble unto Luc. 18
men / be possible yuough to god.

Love your enemies / do well unto Mat. 5
the^ that hate you / and pray for them that persecute and sclau^der you / that
you may be the children of your father that is in heaven / that suffered his
son to arise upon the good and the bad / and reygneth upon the right wise and
vnryghtwyse. Luc. 6


For he is kind unto the unkind and yuell.

Therefore be you merciful / like as your father is merciful. Iuge^ not / and
ye shall not be iuged / condemn ye not / and ye shall not be co^dem^ned /
forgive and ye shall be forgyue^ give and it shall be given unto you.

The rightwise shall shine in the Ma 14
^igdom of my father / as the son.

Come ye blessed of my father / in Ma. 25
heryte the kingdom ordained for you / from the creation of the world.

Truly truly I say unto you / so long as ye do ought / to one of ye lest of
these my brthren / ye do it unto Ma. 28


All power in heaven and inerth (me is given unto me: go therefore and teache all
nations baptisyng them in the name of the father / and the son / and the holy
ghost / teachig them to observe al things / what soever I have commanded you.

Lo I am with you always even until the ending of the world.

Go unto my brothers / and say unto Io. 20
them I ascend unto my father / and your father / my god / and your god. Io. 14


Let not your hertes be troubled / believe in god and believe in me / there be
many mansions in the house of my father / if it were not so / I wol ^e have
told you so / I go to prepare a place for you.

As the father has loved me / s^ Io. 15.
have I loved you.

And what soever ye will asks Io. 14
fader in my name I will do it / tha the father may be glorified in the same /

death of his son / much more now being reconsyled we shall be preserved by
his life.

Unto him all the prophets bear Actu 10

and sent down his son in the symilytude of synful flesh and by sin
dampened sine in the slesshe / y^ rightwisenes of the law might be fulfilled in
us / which walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.

The lord shows mercy / and i^gement to all that suffer wrong he has not
delte ^ us accordyng^ to our sins / nor he has not rewarded us according to
our wy^kednes.

For he has establyshed his mercy upon such as fear him / according unto the
heyght of heuyn fr^ the earth.

Like as a father has mercy o^ his children / so ye lord has merc^ upon them
that fear him / for h^ knew his own creation / he rembred that we are as
dust / and the man is as hay.

All flesh is hey / and all the glor^ Es 40

For the lord sercheth al hertes 1. pa. 18

All congregatio^s of people trust Ps. 61.

It is not written for him only / that it was rekened to him for ryghtwysnes /
but also for us / to whom it shall be counted for right ^^snes / so that we

The lord is a pyteer and m^^cy ^ 441

The lord is loving unto a^^re turts / and his mercyes d^ ^^ced all his works.

The mercyes of the lord ar many Three. 3
fold / for we be not cons^med for his pite has not failed.

For like unto his greatness ^^ Eccl. 2.
is his mercy in him.

The pyre of a man is but emploi^d Ec. 18.
unto his neighbor / but the py ^ of god ^s unto cuery creature.

The mercy of god is beautefull Ercl. 35
^^ to me of tribulation / like as a shower of rain i^ time of drought.

Blessed be god / and the father 2. Lor. 1
of our lord Ihesu Christ the father of mercy / and god of all consolation /
which does conforte us in all our tribulation.

But god which is richt in mercy Ephe. 2
thorough the excedyng charity that he bare unto us / wha^ we were dead in
sin / has re^y^ed us with Christ / by whose grace ye ^e saved.

But after that the benignt ^^^ and Titu^. 3.

us by the well of regeneracion / and by the (...)ynge of the holy ghost / the
which ^^shed on us had oundauntly thorough Jesus Christ our savior so that we
being ons justified ^ his grace / should be heirs of et^nall life through
hope. Iam. 5.


For the lord is merciful an pytefull.

Blessed be god the father of ou^ 1. Pet. 2
lord Jesus Christ / which thorough his habundant mercy hat^ begotten us
again into lyuyng^ hope by the resurrection of Irs^ Christ from death / for to
enjoy a^ ^heritan^ce that never corrupteth^

wherefore in all things it beca^ ^ebr. 2
him to be made like unto his br^thern that he might be a mercyfu^ and a
faithful Bishop in thyn^ges concerni^g god / for to forgyu^ the sins of the
people.

How great is the mercy of the ^c. 17.
lord / andhis pardon / to all tha^ to urne to him.

Turn ye unto your lorder go^ Iohe. 2
for he is kynde^ merciful / pacien^ and of great pity / and forgetful of
malice.

which only has preserved yo^ 1. ^^ 20
from all your harms and troubles.

Approach ye unto him / and be Ps. 34
Illumined / and your faces shall not be shamed.

Turn therefore you sinners / and Tob. 15
^o tustyce in the sight of god / and believe y^ he has showed his mercy unto
you.

your lord god id holy and merciful / which 2 pa. 50
will not turn his face away from you / if ye will reuerte unto him.

It is good and acceptable in the 1 Timothy 2
sight of god our sautoue / which would have all men saved / and to come unto
y^ know ege of the true the / for there is one god and one me by at or between god
and man / that is Jesus Christ / the man which gave him self a ransom for
all men.

For we have not a Bishop that Hebr. ^
is unable to have compassyon on our in fyrmytes / but he was tempted in all
things / in like manner / but yet without sin / let us go therefore boldly
unto the throne of his grace / that we may optay^ mercy / and find favor in
tyn^ of need.

For he is able to save euerlasti^ Heb. 7
lie / all that a^roche unto god tho^ rough him / and is evermore lyung and
making intercessyon for v^

For he inte^deth nothing but m^^cy / he Mic. 7
will reuert and will have merc^ on us / and will put away our wick^nes / and
will cast our sins down in to the depenes of the sea.

The lord god will cast down Esa 25.
death for ever / and will take awa^ the tears from every face / and the shame
of his people out of all the world / for the lord has spoken and they shall
say at that time: B^holde / this is our god / we will lok^ after him / and he
will save us / w^ have abidde^ him / and we shall be gla^ and rejoice in the
salvation of him

The lord him self shall gave ^ Esa. 7.
sign unto you: Behold / a vir^^ shall conceive and bear a son whose name
shall be Emanuel.

A babe is borne for us / and a so^n^ Esai. 6
given unto us / and principality so set upon his sholder / and his name
shalde called wonderful / a coo^sellour / a mighty god / ye father of the
^orld to come / the prince of peace.

Verily he has suffered our in ^r^ities / and Esa. 53
has sustained our sorrows / *and we have esteemed him as ^eprofe / and stryken
of god / and brought love.

For he has wounded him self for our wyckednes / he was afflycted for our
offenses / on him rested the discipline of peace / and were made hole by his
grefe / all we wandered as sheep / every one went of his way / and the lord
took upon him the wickedness of us all.

And the lord is made a socour Psa. 9.
to the poor / a defender / always ready in the time of tribulation.

The lord is at hand to all yt Psa. 33
be troubled in their hertes / and he will save the meke in spirit. The
troubles of the ryghtwyse are manyfolde / and from all these / the lord byll
deliver them.

God is our socour and stre^gth^ P. 45.
a defender in our tribulatio^s / wh^che we have fou^den ouermoch.

For he will deliver the poor Ps. 71.
from the mighty / and the poor that has no helpar.

He will spare the poor and the nedy / and will save the souls of the poor.

They shall be his people / and he Apo. 12
their god / and god shall wype away every tear from their eyes / and death
shall not be any more / nor morning / nor cryeng / nor sorrow / after that the
first be passed.

If god be on our party / who can Romans 8
prevail against us / which has not spared his own son / but has
delivered him for us al / how than has not he given unto us al things with
him.

who shall therefore depart us from the love of Christ / shall trouble / or
myserye / or hungre / or necessyte / or peril / or persecutyon? or the sword.

For I am sure that neither death ^or life / nor Angels / nor rule / ^or power
/ nor things present / nor things to come / nor strength nor heyght / nor
depnes / nor any ^^cature / shall be able to depart us from the charity of god
/ which is in Christ Jesus our lord.

Se what manner of love the father John. 5
has showed unto us / for to be named the sons of god / and so to be in
deed.

For the sperite of god does beat Roma. 8.
uytnes unto our spyryte / that we be the sons of god / if we be sons /
than be we heirs of god / and coheres with Jesus Christ / so yt we do suffer
for to be glorified.

For the spirit him self prays for us w syghes unable to be told

God sent down the spyrite of Gal. 4
his son into our hertes / cryenge ^ather father / Therefore now art thou not
bound but a son / and if thou be a son than art thou an ^tyre through god.

This is the co^fydence that we 1 Ioa. 5
^^ue in god / that what so ever we desire according unto his whyll^ hereth us.

For we do know the grace ^ 2 Cor 8
our lord Jesus Christ thou y^ s^ out sake he was made pore wha^ he was rich
/ to thentent that ^ his poverty you might be rich.

Christ has redeemed us from Gala. 3
the curse of the law / and was a cursed for us.

For if through the sin of on death reigns / much more the that receive
thabundau^ce of gra^ and the reward of tyghtwy sen^ in life / shall reign
through The^ Christ. Therefore / like as through the sin of one ^^ / many m^
we ^ da^yned / even so through the ^ush of one man / all men were justified

For through man came deat 2 cor 15.
and through man came the ^ysy^ of the dead / and ly^c as all dych the rough
Adam / even so wete all ^^ued through Christ.

But the grace of god is eter^^ Romans 6
life in Christ Thrf^ our lord.

For in him rests the corp^^ Colos. 2
(...) / all the godheed full and hole.

Thereby appears the love of god 1. Io. 4
unto us / for god sent his only be^otten son in to the world that we might
live through him / there in was charity / not by cause we loved god / but for
asmoch as he loved us before / and sent down his son to for give out sins
/ most ^erly beloved / if god has loved us than are we bounden one to love
another.

Surely we know / that unto such Romans 8
^s love god / all thyuges do work ^or the best.

God has prepared for such as Cor. 2.
love him / things / y^ no eye has ^uer seen / nor hard with any care
neither can be compassed with the thought of man's heart.

For I suppose y^ the affly ctyons Romans 8
if this life can not discryue y^ glory / which shall be showed upon us.

There is but one lord of al / whi To. 10.
^he is lyberall to them that call on ^ym.

who has he despised that has Eccl. 2.
called on him / for he is a god loly and merciful / and forgyueth sy^nes in
the day of trybulatyon / ^ is defendour unto all that call o^ him in truth. woe
be to you of do^ble heart and wicked lyppes / an^ misdoyng hands / and to the
sin y^ goth two ways on the grou^d^

woe be to the dyssolute in heart which do not believe god / and the^ fore they
shall not be defended of h^

But after y^ he has called upon 2. Mat 12.
the almighty / which through h^^ power does break the strength ^^ enemies /
they took the cite.

And they did cry to the lord p. 106.
when they were troubled / and h^ delivered the from their necessy^

Unto the voice of their plain Es. 30.
te he will answer / as soon as ^^ has herd it.

Lo / the hand of ye lord is n^ Es. 50.
shortened / but that he is able t^ save / nor his ear is not so stoppe^ but he
can here.

Be ye therefore subdued under 2. Pet 5
mighty hand of god / that he man ^xalte you i^ the time of visitation putting
al your care in him / for he has charge of you.

He has created both small and Psa. 6.
great / and equalyte he has cure of ^ll things.

Dread the lord ye that be his Psa. 33
saints / for there is no scarsyte to any that dread him.

Delight in the lord / and he shall Ps. 36.
grant unto the ^ thy peticy on of thy heart. disclose thy ways unto the
lord / and trust in him / and he will do for the.

The steps of man shall be directed by the lord / when he happeth to fable he
shall not be hurt / for ye lord shall put under his hand.

I was young and wared old / and I have not scen the rightwyse for sake / nor
any of his Issue destitu^^ of living for always he pitieth ^bideth and his seed
shall be blessed.

Last thy thought upon the lord Ps. 54
and he shall norisshe the / and he ^yl never give trouble to ye right ^yse.

Have confydence in the lord Pro. 3.
with all thine heart / and do na^ trust in thine own wisdom! I^ all thy
ways remember him / and he shall order thy steps.

The lord shall not aff^^cte the Pro. 30
soul of the ryghtwyse with hungr^ and he shall overthrow the awayte^ of the
wicked.

Dysclose thy works unto the Pro. 16
lord / and thy thought shall be dyrected / the lord has wrought al^ things
for him self / and the wicked unto an evil day.

The heart of man dysposeth his way / but it longs unto the lord for to
dyrecte his steps.

Many thoughts do ron in the Pro. 19
heart of a man / but the will of the lord abides evermore.

It is good for to abide the salu^tion Three. 3.
of the lord with silence.

Therefore the lord does tarry t^ Esa. 30
have mercy on the / and he shall ^^ exalted in sparing of you / for he ^^ the
lord god of judgment / blessed are they that look after him.

In thy morning thon shall not need to mourn / for he that pitieth will have
mercy on the.

For god is thy merciful lord Deuteronomy 4
god.

And his mercy is on al them that Luc. 1.
fear him through out all generatyons.

Do not say I will do harm for Pro. 20
barme / but tarry upon the lord / and he will deliver the.

Keep your selves in the love of Jude. 1
god / loking after the mercy of our lord Jesus Christ / for y^ life
everlasting.

For the grace of god / that gy^eth Titio. 2
health unto al men has appe^ed / and taught us for to deny al ungodliness /
and worldly lusts and that we should live honestly / right ^isly and godly in
this present worl^^ / lokynge for that blyssed hope ^glorious appcryng of the
migh^e god and our savior Jesus Christ the which gave him self for us.

For to redeem us from all vnrightwysnesse / and to purge us ^ peculyar people
unto him follow yng good works.

Happy at they / whose vnrigh^ Psa. 31
wysnes is forgyuen / and the sin ar kept secret.

Happy is that man ^ to who^ god has not rekened any synn^ and in whose heart
there is no d^ ceyte.

Happy is that man whiche^ Job. 5.
corrected by the lord / the correcyon of the lord / thou shalt na^ therefore
refuse / for he wounds heals / he stryketh / and his hau^ makes hole.

The lord kylleth and reuyueth 1. Ke. 2.
he brings down to hell and bri^geth out / the lord makes poo^ and makes
rich / he puts done and sets up.

For the lord punyssheth by Heb. 12
that he loves / and he scourge every child whom he receives sever in
lernyng. God offreth h^ self unto you / as unto his sons / for what son is
there / whom the father does not correct.

Furthermore we have had our carnal fathers as teachers / and them we did obey
/ shall we not therefore much more obey our spyrituall father by whom we shall
live?

Truly every lernyng seems now not to be joyful / but soroufull / but
afterward it shall bring forth the most mylde fruit of right wysnes unto all
that at exercysed in it.

For our excedyng try bulatyon 2 cor. 4
which is transytorie and light / prepares an exceeding / and in eternal
weight of glory unto us while we be in the cont^plaryon / not of thiges
visyble / but of y^ vnuisyble

For whom the lord loves he Pro. 3.
corrects / and takes a co^ceyte in him / as in his son.

My brethern count it exceeding Ia^^e 1
Joy / when ye fall in to diverse te^pracyons / remembryng how that the tryeng
of your faith brings pacyence.

Understand that like as ye b^ 2 Lor. 1
fellows in pain / even so shall y^ be in conforte.

God is faithful / which shall 1. cor. 10
not suffer you to be tempted about your strength / but shall in the mids of
your temptation make away for you to escape out.

For the lives of the ryghtwys^ Sapi. 3
be in the hands of god / and the tourment of death shall not touch^ them.

And natwithstandying that they have suffered torment before men yet their hope
is replenisshed with Immortalyte. 2 Pet. 2


God knows how to delyue^ the virtuous out of temptation ^ to reserve the
wicked / unto the day of iugment / for to be tourme^* ted.

He will deliver the poor ou^ Job. 36
of his myserye / and he will open his care in time of trybulation.

He deals patiently for you^ 2. Pet. 3
sakes / and is loath that any shuld^ peryshe / but that all should turn unto
repentance.

when we are iuged we are corrected 1. Cor. 11
by the lord / by cause we shall not be condemned with this world.

He has chastysed us for our Teb. 13
vnrightwysenes / and he will save us for his mercyes sake.

All things ar of god / which 2 Cor. 5
has reconsyled us unto him self / by Ihesu Christ / and has given us the
office to preach the accord / for god was in Christ / and made the agreement
bytwen the world and him self / and rekened not their sins unto them / and
has committed unto us the preachinge of the accord.

Holy / holy / the god of battle Esa. 6.
all the earth is replenysshed with his glory. Colos 1


For it pleased the father that in him should all ^lentuousnes remain / and by
him to reconsyle althynges unto him self / and to set a peace by him through
the blood of his cross with what so ever that was either in heaven or in earth

For he has borne our sins 1 Pet. 2
with his body upon a tree / to then tent that we should be dead / as
concerning sin / and should live in ryghtwysnes.

Christ dyed ones for our sins 1. pet. 3
ryghtuous for the vuryghtuous / for to offer us unto god mortifyed in flesh
/ but reuyued in spirit.

He does purge us from all sin 1 John 1
by the blood of Ihesu Christ his son / if we say that we be without sin
/ we do deceive our own selves / and the truth is not in us.

If we knowledge our sins / he 1. Io. 2
is faithful and just to forgive us our sins / and to cleanse us from al
unrighteousness.

My little children / these things 1. Io. 2
writ I unto you / ye ye should not sin / and if any man sin / yet have we
an advocate with the father Jesus Christ which is right wise / and he it is that
optayneth grace for our sins / not for our sins only / but also for the
sins of all the world.

Children I writ unto you / how that your sins ar forgiven for his names
sake.

For there is no difference / all he Rom ^.
ue sinned / and do lack the praise that is of value before god / we are
justified freely by his grace through the redempty on that is in Christ Jesus /
whom god has made a sea te of mercy through fay the in his blood / to show the
ryghtwysnes / which before him is of valor in that he forgyueth the sins
that are passed / which god did suffer to show at this time the ryghtwysnes
that is allowed of him / that he might be counted just and a rustyfier of hi^
that believes in the faith of Jesus Christ.

God has wrapped all nations To. 11.
in unbelieve / to the intent that he might have mercy on al / o the depnes of
thabu^da^t wisdom and know lege of god / how in conprchensyble ar his
iugementes / and his wais vnsorcheable.

The scripture has wrapped al Gala. 3
things under sin / that the promise should be fulfilled unto all ye do
