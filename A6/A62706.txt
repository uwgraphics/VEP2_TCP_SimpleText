To His Highness the Prince of Orange. The Humble ADDRESS OF THE Lord Mayor,
Aldermen and Commons OF The City of London, In Common Council Assembled.
May it please your Highness,
WE taking into Consideration your Highness's fervent Zeal for the Protestant
Religion, manifested to the World, in your many and hazardous Enterprises which
it has pleased Almighty God to Bless you with Miraculous Success. We render
our deepest Thanks to the Divine Majesty for the same, and beg leave to present
our most Humble Thanks to your Highness particularly, for your appearing in
Arms in this Kingdom, to carry on and perfect your Glorious Design, to Rescue
England, Scotland, and Ireland from Slavery and Popery, and in a Free
Parliament to Establish the Religion, the Laws, and the Liberties of these
Kingdoms, upon a Sure and Lasting Foundation.

We have hitherto looked for some Remedy, for the Oppressions, and Eminent
Dangers We, together with our Protestant Fellow Subjects labored under, from
His Majesty's Concessions and Concurrences with Your Highness's Just and Pious
Purposes, expressed in Your Gracious Declarations.

But herein finding Ourselves finally disappointed by His Majesty's withdrawing
Himself, We presume to make Your Highness our Refuge: And do in the Name of
this Capital CITY, implore Your Highness's Protection; and most humbly beseech
Your Highness to vouchsafe to Repair to this CITY, where Your Highness will be
Received with Universal Joy and Satisfaction.
