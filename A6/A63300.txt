Exeunt. Enter Townshift and Trapheire. Town. Pray recollect your self, I
cannot do it
Without a loss to my repute and fame,
If you have but a foot of ground unsold.
Therefore consult your thoughts, my willingness
Shall not be wanting to procure your freedom;
But I Would not have a dirty piece of Land
Bring an obstruction to it.

Tra. Why? as I live
I have not an Inch left; what ere I morgag'd
Is either sold outright, or forfeited,
I lie not on my Credit.

Town. How Is that Man?
Have you credit then? Why, that is as bad.
It is not held convenient by the Huffe,
Lords of the sword, that any Yongster should
Be one of us 'till he 'as not only lost
his 'state, but's credit too.

Tra. Upon my life,
Dear Townshift, I Have not credit for a thrips;
Thou know it well enough, my roaging Landres
Will not do it for the washing of a shirt.

Town. Why, have you shirts then?

Tra. One as I live, no more, and that so thin
You may draw't through a Needle.

Town. What Boots have you?

Tra. I cannot call these any, yet they are all;
And as for stockings, I have long ago
Held them unnecessary.

Town. Why this Cloak,
And the weather warm and friendly.

Tra. It Is too much,
The weight on it, I confess, 's not to be borne,
I Will ease me of the burden, It shall sink
In sack when I Am made free, prithee about it.

Town. I would not for a world you should have any
Remnant of your Estate left,'t would undo you
[Enter drawforth and Pinck-carkase See, here is my Brothers, Drawforth and
Pinck-carkase
May I presume to recommend you to 'em?

Tra. You may, you may, dear Townshift.

Drawf. How now Trapheire,
What is all gone yet?

Town. All he swears by's Twibell,
His Cloak excepted, and its time expires
Within this half hour; shall we make him free?

Pinck. Trapheire, you now are to begin the World,
Which you cannot do handsomely, unless
Your Land and you be separated, and if
Ought ly concealed, 'twill rise in judgment against you;
Therefore pray have a care, it is Christian Counsel.

Drawf. It is not fit the least piece of your old
Adulterate fortunes should corrupt the new
Your wit must purchase.

Town. Right, beside, he will never
Have a refined Wit 'till he has nothing left.

Tra. The greatest Enemy I have Gentlemen is my Cloak,
And I promise I Will fee 't no more.

Pinck. Say you so, then to the next Tavern;
Boy -- boy -- a Room.

[Enter Drawer. Draw. Please you to walk into a Room Gentlemen?

Town. What call we thee for else?

[They pass in and enter again Draw. How like you this Room Gentlemen?

Town. Indifferent; bring us Wine and Tobacco of the best sirrah.

Draw. You shall indeed sir.

Tra. Dear Townshift thou must show this Gentleman
The way to the Brokers.

[Pointing at his Cloak. Town. Is he for sale, or Morgage?

Tra. For sale by all means, I Would not charge my memory
I Have ought left worth redeeming.

[Enter boy with wine. Drawf. Bravely resolved -- Is It Racie?

Draw. Right Racie sir believe me.

Pinck. Trapheire to thee.

Tra. Drink apace, dear Townshift
[To his cloak. The sight of that same Gentleman's my tortour,
I prithee rid me of him.

Drawf. Townshift swear him.

Tra. I cannot with a safe conscience swear as long
As that appears before me.

Town. How shall I get it out oth' house?

Tra. Leave thine here, and wear mine thither.
O how I hate to call it mine -- away wit't.
Exit Townshift.
Pinck. Trapheire, you now must exercise your Wit
To live on others, as w'ave lived on you;
Wit's never good till purchased, what though it be
With the loss of fortunes Trumperie and Trash;
Content never dwells among dirtie Land, who sells it
Parts with a deal of care, and scurvie toil;
Men never are ingenious that are clogged with it.
The Generous spirit will not be cooped up
In that same Country Cage, a mansion house,
And confines of the Buttery; be free,
Thou art not worth a Groat
[Enter Townshift. When this is spent.

Tra. How much, how much dear Townshift?

Town. But thirty by my Valor.

Tra. Down with it, down with it;
[The money laid on the Table. I Will not put up a Dodkin on it; dear Townshift,
Drink, drink away, I thirst until it is melted,
Your moulten silver swallows best.

Drawf. His Oath, his Oath.

Town. Your sword.
[Laies his hand on the Hilts of his Sword, By this Hilt, and this Blade
Which at Hounslow was made,
You swear to be true
To what shall ensue.
First, You swear not to make it any scruple of Conscience to cheat your
Father; That you will hunt after young Heirs, and when you have courst them
out of wind, you will refresh 'em with some Scrivener, Broker, or Draper; That
you will keep always three strings to your bow, to make it bend till it break;
That having gotten a Bubble or Bishop, a lad of the last adoption, that you
make him sensible of a Wench, though to the charge of a Surgeon, it being
reason all trades should live, and if occasion be, wink at small faults. Next
be sure to keep them continually at Game, or Drinking; Uurge 'em to quarrel,
and then take up the business, but not without profit to the Brotherhood; That
what quarrels soever arise among our selves, must not cause us to fight with
one another, but the Coins of the Bubble or Bishop must make us friends; That
you must not pay your Coachman but with kicks, unless your Bubble or Bishop
do, and then he owes you a fare; That your Bubble, or Bishop, and you, keep but
one Purse, though two Drabs; That when you have dreined him dry, you make him
free, if he sue for it, if not let him keep Company with the Titteretues, and
live upon the sin of Sodom; That you I take your chance of the day, where there
is need of dipping, without grumbling.

That while you can stand
With sword in your hand,
You Will not be in aw
Of the Halberteere Law;
Kiss this -- Now you are free
[Kisses the Hilts Of the Huffs company.

Tra. Hey for the Brotherhood; No Wine stirring, Boy? You Rascal, where is your
duty? absent? hah! More Wine.

[Enter Drawer. Draw. You shall sir by and by.

Tra. Bring a Glass will hold
A Pint at least, I hate a thimble full,
We shall never have consumed this mighty mass
[Pointing to the [Money. If we sip thus like sparrows;
Enter Drawer. I marry, this looks like some Brother to you all.

Drawf. Gramercy.

Tra. Sirrah, cover the Board with Bottles,
This is our Coronation day, the Room
Shall swim in Wine; be frolique Huffs, and draine
Me dry, yet I shall live when you are all hanged.

[He begins to be drunk. Town. How now, how now Traphiere!

Tra. Drink and be damned;
Must I wait on your Driveling?

Town. Drawforth to you -- Charge him home.

Draw. Traphiere a whole bottle to thee -- I Am up toth' Chin.

Tra. -- So, so sir, -- you are a fine fellow; Is all paid?

Town. No, all is not come in yet.

Tra. I Will stay no longer.

[He takes Townshifts cloak up. Town. Pray leave my cloak behind you.

Tra. Your cloak sir? how came it to be yours sir? I have one some where.


Town. Yours is at the Brokers sir.

Tra. Is it so sir? I thank you for your information.

Drawf. There lies the virtue on it.

Tra. So sir, I thank you twice; for once I care not if I put my Cloak into my
pocket.


[He snatcheth up the money. Town. But Trapheire, Trapheire.

Pinck. Who paies the house?

Tra. Let the house pay it self; dip, dip and be hanged you that have Cloaks,
am I bound to fill your insatiate Gorge eternally.


Pinck. What Asses were we to let the money ly so long, knowing his Rascally
humor, he will not pay a Penny when he is in drink -- See what thou can work him
to.


Town. Boy.

[Enter Drawer. Drawf. Sir -- I shall sir.

[They whisper. Town. Trapheire, a prize Trapheire.

Tra. Of what? Sprats?

Town. A Gudgin man, a Gudgin's come to Net;
The Master of the house desires admittance
To play a Game at Ticktack for a Piece;
And thou know Trapheire -- hah --

[He shakes his Arms. Tra. I know it Rogue;
And thou shall play with him for all he is worth;
I Will venture on thy hand my whole Estate,
This my trusty Blade. Provided always sir --

[Enter Master of the house. Town. That you have half -- it is granted -- he is
here;
Thou know I have no money.

Tra. Thou shall not want dear Bully, I Will not leave
My self a George.

[He gives him his money. Town. Spoke like thy self, come be so.
There sir, pay your self.

Mr, You Are kindly welcome Gentlemen, fetch my Quart.

Tra. Death, what is this?

Omnes Ha ha, ha -- Only the Reckoning paid sir.

Tra. You Are Rogues, Shirks, and Cheates; I Will indict you

Pinck. Buoy good sir, employ your Tongue at Billings gate;
Adieu, adieu.

[Exeunt Town, Pinck. Drawforth. Tra. Farewell and be hanged.
For your part sirrah, I Will have you up for keeping of a Bawdy house.

Exit.
Mr. Do your worst sir, do your worst.

A slave perpetually.

We Will send to Drawforth and the rest.

Tra. 'T will not do,
They Will make but a disturbance in the street,
Yet I may be surpised for all their Valor,
And then I am undone; the hopes I have
In one I am to dine with lost, which might
Be worth to thee and me some hundreds Bully.

Of such excelling beauty, you would swear

As Cupid when he wantons.

I Have no remorce for it. Can you sing?

We have a merry life so long as't lasts.
I Will lay my life you fence not neither.

Wit. Yes,
My grounds I do.

Tra. Have you the grounds of fencing? that is, to
Make the Passado, to retreive, comply,
Defend, make up, close, and Disarme;
You know not this I warrant?

Wit. Not I truly.

Tra. I cannot think what will become of you,
When you meet Men of valor.

Witw. I pray keep me
Out of their company, I love no quarrels;
I came to study the Law.

Tra. At a fine time.
You Have bought no Books I hope.

Wit. I, but I have.

Tra. Return them to the Bookseller for shame;
A Sword will prove more useful: hark ye Coz,
I am resolved to have you learn to fence.

Wit. I Would rather learn to sing.

Tra. That ye shall too:
Enter Townshift. Your money will do all things -- yonder is Townshift,
How like a Rogue he looks? I will not shun him.

Exeunt. ACT. III.
Enter Iocky, and Mistress Smalfaith. Iock. FIE Mastres fie, geod feith you are
mickle oout; I ga hum noought bet convenable stooff.


Mrs Small. You Are a Rascal, a Scotch Horseleech, a Doctor, a Dolthead: Oh the
madness of the men of these times; if any of them be but a little out of
temper, none can set them right but a Scotch Doctor forsooth, as though all the
English ones were fools. But Sirrah, Sirrah, it is well known my husband [she
runs at him. was never distempered, till he came acquainted with such a
De-coy as you -- Curse on the time --


[VVeeps. Ioc. Geod Mistras hark ye toll me.

Mrs Small. Hang you Rascal, my Husband was never troubled with whimsies in
his head, nor never railed against his Superiors; he was ever a quiet man, and
an honest man, and had the love of the whole Court, and so had I too. Many a
good turn have the good Gentlemen done me, which I must never expect now again,
so violently my Husband railes against the Government. But if he suffer for it,
thou shall not wear a Nose to thy face; a Nose on thy face said I: Nay if
there be a sign-post in all this Town I Will hang thee on it -- Ah poor heart.

Enter Mr Smallfaith. Here he comes -- See what a pickle you have put him in;
My fingers itch to come at thy face, that ugly [she runs at him. face of thine.

Mrs Small. Sweet heart.

Mr Small. Oh, art thou there? it is well; there has bin nere
A Pursevant here yet to fetch me, has there?

Mrs Small. A Pursevant for you! for what cause Husband?

Mr Small. I am too honest, that is cause enough.
There is a Council Table, Yes forsooth,
And at it is contrived men's ruins -- hah.
[starts. Who Is that? who is that? is it not for me they ask?
I shall be lost quite, if I look not well
About me.

Mrs Sma. True, you are in the way to undo
Your self, and me, and all your Family.
But this is thy Gin Rascal; Oh I could tear thee.

[runs at him. Ioc. Mistras ga me whil toll speak toll ye; these wudnes o his,

Mrs Small. I have not Patience.

[she starts. Ioc. Hoow doll ye geod sir?

Mr Small. Oh Mr Doctor is it thee! art safe?
It Is wonderful there is nothing charged against thee!
There is an Office called the Green-cloth too,
Has no man had thee there yet?

[she starts again. Ioc. They ken me sa weel sir -- It warks brawly.

Mrs Small. Hark you Husband, what is that you said but now? I beleev't, what
was it? the King is pestilent, wilful; hah; I was it so? why then, for ought I
know, he must be beaten into better manners.


Ioc. Reight weel sed geod feith.

Mrs Small. Honest Mr Doctor, pray come in sir;
You are the welcom'st man come to my house
This fortnight -- Husband love him, has he not
A taking countenance?

Mr Small. No body at the Gate?
[starts. I am possessed with fears and jealousies.

Mrs Small. And well you may be Husband, I am sure
You have had cause enough, good Man, I grieve,
I grieve to think on it.

Mr Small. Mr Doctor, be advised;
Pray go not unprepared; to Night you shall
Take my house for your shelter, things work strangely.

Mrs Small. Sweet Mr Doctor you shall be so welcome,
It passes; truly, you are a man upright
In every thing I warrant, pray come in sir.

Ioc. Geod feith, tha cass is awter'd.

Exeunt. Enter a Crew of Country People. 1 Coun. Bring forth your Prongs
Neighbors; All men stand up for the truth: And he that will lie on the Sunday,
is not to be trusted the week after, what say you Neighbors?


2 I say a Sundaies lie may go as far as a work-daies, my reason is, it has
more leisure to travel.


3 For my part neighbors let them lie that will I have no more to do with a
lie, then a lie has to do with me; if any lies with my wife, it shall go hard
but i will do as much with his.


1 I, if he have none Neighbor.


3 Why, if he have none Neighbor, I must go without; no man will be a slave I
think.


2 A slave! who has such a mind let him have it still: For my part Neighbors,
I Will work hard, earn my bread with the sweat of my brows, none shall eat away
the fruit of my labor, but I will sit down when it is done, and laugh, in
despite of all the Kasars in the World.


4 Hold a pluck there Neighbor, it is ill playing with edge-tooles; that word
despite comes not in handsomely, and may bring us all to the Pot.


3 What! have we a scab'd sheep amongst us? lets clear our flock of him.


4 Hold Neighbor, hold, I am for you with all my heart, but give me leave to
speak to you; I am but a fool it is confessed, but children and fools tell truth
sometimes, you know.


Omnes. And what of that, and what of that.


4 I say again, it is dangerous meddling with edge-tooles; there is store of trees
here abouts, and there may be Gibbets made of them, and you know well enough
what fruit Gibbets bring forth; I say no more, but be careful what you do.


Omnes. Away with him, away with him.


4 One word more Neighbors, one word more; it is not well to mock our
Superiors, much worse to threaten them: for as I have heard, there was a suit
at Law commenced about a Fart.


Omnes. Ha, ha, ha, how man, how!


4 Why, I will tell you Neighbors, be but patient; there was a fellow, I Will not
tell his name, was pissing against the wall, the Mayor came by, now you know
the Proverb, tell a tale to a Mare, and 'twill let a fart; but here the case
alters, for the fellow let the fart, and the Mayor took it in the nose, and
caused the fellow to be carried to the Town Hall, as Prisoner.


3 The Mayor was a Horse, or a Whoreson knave, what is this to us?


4 Now toth' suit.

2 It Is worn out, weel have none on it.

4 Neighbors lay down your Prongs, take my devise;
It Is an old Proverb, be merry and wise.

Omnes. Away with him, away with him, we will break the Cords of our slavery.

The soul must be imperfect; for I Have known

The benefit of expression to.

Ioc. You Are a Scollard sir.

Any. And I presume you one. I have read something
Of the Metaphysics, though I took not on me
The function, or the practice: But, no more
Of that sir, it is not wisdom in a man
Unskil'd, to hold a weapon against a Fencer.

Ioc. Mickle weel sed geod feith.

Any. All my Discourse

T'afford me your opinion; some thing I aile,
But know not what, save this, a deprivation
Of breath, and find it prejudicial to

Lay. You think so husband, I warrant.


Soon. Why, a King's no more.


Lay. Nay, is he that husband? troth I dare say our man William is as good a

on's head.


Soor. Well, I am resolved William shall forth.


Lay. Forth, how do you mean forth? I hope you will not leave me unprovided at
home; you know your own business abroad, and I am certain he can do your

consequence short winded; It is a trick of Rome to starve our Religion; Let
Iezabell be brought before the Elders, and the whore of Babyilon to the
Whipping post, let her have lash upon lash; let her smock be given to the
Rag-men, it may come to be Paper, and her Condemnation writ in it; let the
Whelps and the Cubs be brought to the Stake, baite'um, baite'um, baite'um, I
am your warrant says Mr Doctor.


Boys. Master Doctor's an Ass.


Any. Children you talk not like men, you are but midling Christians, it is well
known to the Parish.


Boys. That Bedlams fit for you.


Any. Those that will follow me, let 'um follow me,

I am now for the Truth,
And the Covenant in sooth.

Exeunt. Boys. Hi, hi, hi, Stow the Friar, stow the Friar.


[They sing. Exeunt after him. Enter Downfall and Worn-out. Down. You see what
he has brought me to, my Crutches;
I was ere held an able man you know;
Had my tongue at Command, and my head too,
But now they both are so enfeebled I
Have scarce the use of either; if I had
It were all one, the Country People are
Bewitched into belief, they have as much
Reason and Law as I, and will become
Their own Sollicitors, and Council too.
I cannot last long, but expect still when
My Crutches will deceive me, and I fall
To the ground for ever.

Worn. -- I am brought to nothing
As Well as you, I little thought a Scotchman
Could ere have dreind my Veins, and purse so dry,
I am not worth the ground I go on; so
Dejected are my thoughts; my spirit lost,
And all the hopes of my recovery
Extinct and buried.

Down. I should not have known you,
Had you not told me who you were; you are
So changed from your self. Oh those were times,
Worthy to call to mind, (though to our grief)
When you and I, like Twins, derived a being
From one another sustenance, the Monopolies
That you projected, and I perfected!
Like two expert Limners, the one employed
To fashion the face, the other to finish it.

Worcester. -- I, those were times indeed, but all I got
Then, has been since consumed; and I guess
You are not much the better; I am weary
I protest of my life, and would thank him
Would do me so much good as take it from me.

Dow. -- Patience is the best remedy where no
Better can be obtained; it is vain to crave
The thing we want when it is not to be had;
Your dancing days are done, and all the breath
The Scot has left me scarce will heat my fingers.

Worn. -- And my affliction does the more increase
To see my friends disabl'd, as I am,
From helping one another, it is a grief
That Is inexpressible, and not for cure.

Down. -- What Fortune sowres, content must sweeten, he
Is the best man o'rcomes his misery.

Exeunt. Enter Small faith and his wife. Small. -- For my part, I am but a man,
and I owe but a death, let them take it, as they say they will, give 'um good
on it, let them come, let them come -- where are they? stand, stand, stand.


Wife. Husband now you talk of standing, pray let me lie down, and then let 'em
do their worst, I defy 'em.


Small. -- And so do I, we will to the Terret, Woman, and there we are secured
against Devil, and Pursevant.


Wife. -- I Am wearied off my legs with doing nothing but running up and down in
every Nooke and Corner like a Rat for fear of catching.


Small. -- They are coming, they are coming; let me come in woman, let me come
in.


Wife. I would you would come in husband once, you have been out long enough to
small purpose I Am sure.


Exeunt. Enter Surehold, Resolution. Res. Believe it, their Design aims at our
ruin;
And though the Cord they make be somewhat finer
Than Ordinary, 'Twill choke us at the last;
I hold a naked freedom better far
Than an adorned Prison; golden fetters
And Iron ones produce a like effect,
What differs them's but curiosity.

Sure. Into what a Lethargy has these rabble Scots
Betrayed the peoples senses? tell them on it
And they will abuse you for it. Nay, though they see
Distraction brought unto their very doors,
They Will look on it, and not know it till they feel it,
And then will tamely kiss the Rod that whipped 'em.
A Nation proud and Arrogant as the Beggar,
That when h'as got a Bonnet 'bove his wearing,
Will scarce bow to the Giver. All the service
They ever did this Nation was to help
The people eat their victuals, and share their fortunes.

Res. They Are good for naught, but to eat, louze, and sleep,
And stinck a street up. Tell you stories of
Don John of Austria, the Magull, great Cham,
Their valor at Madril, Levant, or where
You will, and this in some blind Chimney Corner
In fume and smoke, roused up with lanted Ale,
'Till that their faces do resemble the Towns
They set on fire; And yet dare not encounter
A Rat or Weesell.

Sure. -- Yet the world reports
Them, men for siege the best, and can endure
The greatest hardship.

Reso. Very true, if they
May but ly still they will feed on one another,
Rather than venture on their Enemy
To get the least Provision, and indeed
The worst will serve their turn, for they are men
Loves any thing but beating, yet they will take
That too if need be; take'em down a little,
And you may fillip dead a score of them.
It is a shame the English should become
Such mules to such base burdens; I Am resolved
To turn the Chance o'th'Dy that favors them,
Though to the hazard of my being.

Sure. -- 'Twill
Be taken a piece of service fit for Chronicle,
And you shall want no furtherance.

Reso. If I bring not
The Soldier, Doctors, and their Crew of Cheaters
As tamely to be hanged as puppy Dogs,
Let me recelve no credit from you after.

Exeunt. Enter Soonegul'd and a Seminary Priest going to weigh the Covenant
with the Popes Bull. Soon. Sir, though I hate your Bulls, and your Decoyes,
And know you have two ends to all your ways;
I fear you not, for Truth will show her self
Inspight of all the clouds you cast upon her.

Sem. You are in th'right. Truth will appear, and that
To th'shame of your trimmed Covenant; for though
She be but plain, she is more glorious
Than all the gloss and Colors that sets forth
That new devise, Created to deceive
Poor simple people, and at last your selves.

Soon. These are but bandying, I Will pursue my wager.

Sem. I Will venture ten pound more you are lost in weight.

Soon. You Will lose your self sir with your confidence.

Sem. Bar treachery and I care not.

Exeunt. Enter Trapheire, Witwud, and Townshift. Wit. I cannot endure this
fighting Coz, a Dad.

Tra. Pox take your Dad; is that an Oath for a Gentleman?
A Lad at ten swears more profoundly; you will
Be quarrelling, and then you dare not fight;
As though I were a wall of Steel or Brass,
To stand betwixt you, and receive the Darts
Cast at you; Sir, why did your Cowship send
An Answer to your Challenge, if you found
Your blood so Cool and Phlegmatic?

Wit. 'Twas your doing, -- I had not had the heart else.

[aside. Town. For preservation of your honor sir
Could you do less than Answer him?

Wit. What was he
That brought the Challenge?

Town. Pinckcarcase by name.

Wit. A devilish name, and full of devilish ends;
This fighting is not lawful; prithee Coz
Take up the matter, I have little maw to it.

Town. What, now the Hostage Reputation
Is past, will you Recant, Reneage, Revoke,
Recoyle, Revert? stand to your Principles.

Wit. I shall not stand an inch of ground believe me.

Tra. It Is pity thou art worth any; let me see,
How shall we do it with Honor?

Wit. It Is no matter
For that thing Honor; let her walk alone,
I don't desire her Company on such terms,
Sweet Coz, sweet Coz.

Tra. Let me see -- I Am resolved
That you shall fight him.

Wit. Coz, I had forgot
I swear, a strange infirmity, that is
I zound when as I hear a Gun shot off*
And tremble at a Pistols, all my senses
Become as useless.

Town. Why, 'twas your own motion.

Wit. No matter, it is but so much charges lost,
I will not fight with Bullets, I Have more conscience.

Tra. Why, then you must prepare a Case of Rapiers,
For Townshift and my self, ours are grown dull
With often usage.

Wit. Oh, the better Coz!
They Will do less mischief.

Tra. Then your fencing Master
Must make you at your Chamber fit for the field.

Wit. That Is past his skill I Am sure; more charges Coz.

Tra. It cannot be avoided, if you mean
To fight on foot, and put off your Horse combat.

Wit. In my mind it is horse-play to fight on foot;
But hark you Coz, don't you make winking at
That Weapon ye call sharp, I Am not so set.

Tra. Fie, winking, No, how will you see to hit him;

Wit. No matter so he hit not me; but may not I
Bar Points being the Challenged?

Tra. That Is base, and Player-like.

Wit. I Would rather play so, than work otherwise.

Town. Come, come, resolve, you know the time draws near.

Wit. I would it did not, I love not to think on it;
Can we throw nothing in Times-way to make
Him stumble, and stop a little.

Tra. Resolve upon your weapon ere he be
Furnished with horse and Pistols.

Town. I Will lay my life he is that already, then
'Twill be unworthy in you to --

Wit. Good sir, talk not to me of Worthies, my Father was none of the Nine; he
never kept Company with your Huffs, nor Puffs; be could drink in a Tavern and
never quarrel about the Reckoning; he lived without knocks, and died in the
love of his Parish.


Tra. But he has left a quarrelsome son behind
Must pay for all.

Wit. I sha'n't stand much upon
That point, so I may be discharged from beatings;
Methinks a skin set out with Eylet holes
Appears not handsome, nor a face to be
Painted with black and blew, I hate those colors.

Town. What will you give him shall take up the business without loss to your
honor?


Wit. A man cannot lose
That which he never had; My Father was
A man of Bags, and might have been a Knight
When Knighthoods went a begging.

Town. But to the matter,
What say you to my proposition?

Wit. Troth,
It sounds well, let me see now what in Conscience
You will demand?

Town. But twenty pieces.

Wit. So;
To save a man from beating, very good I
How many such do you meet with in the year?

Town. Hundreds, hundreds sir.

Tra. Men must live Coz, men must live.

Wit. Any where but on me (good Coz;) but sir,
Before my Coz here, I Will give you ten.

Tra. Ten is too little in all conscience Coz.

Town. Consider sir the danger.

Wit. And the Charge
Already I Have been for horse and Pistols;
But those I hope you will return me, when
The peace is made.

Tra. Not one, expect not one,
They Are forfeit Goods to us Lords of the Soil.

Town. It Is true, you have been at charges, and for that
Reason I Will undertake it at your rate;
Forbib, but I should bear a Conscience too.
Meet us at the Mairmaid.

Tra. At the hour of twelve.

Town. The precise time.

Tra. Cozen, he will deserve it.

Wit. Would I had his Art
To live by when I and my fortunes part.

Exeunt. Enter Wantwit, Drawforth, Pinckcarcase. Pinc. He is the Challenged,
and justly may
Design the way of fighting, and the Place;
But though you have provided us with Horses,
Swords, Pistols, and so forth, yet there is a thing
Called money, we do want, put case he should
Fall by your hand, in what a case were we?

Drawf. Suppose that you should fail;
-- I, there is the Danger.

Drawf. We must fly for it, and that we cannot do
Conveniently, without a sum, the Oratory
Of Silver makes our passage free and safe,
The want of it detaines us; open, open
Your close-mouth'd bags, and let them speak to us.

Want. Troth Gentlemen, I Will tell you, and I lie not,
They Have got a hoarsenesse since they came to Town,
And speak so low, a man can hardly hear 'em.

Pinc. One Mortgage sir will raise their voice again.

Want. Well, well, he might have taken another way
To work; had I been he, and he been me,
I would have asked him Mercy.

Drawf. But you see
He is a man of spirit, spirit, sir!

Want. I would he had no more then I, a gnat
Is better furnished; I have heard my Mother
Protest, and solemnly, I had a heart
No bigger than a hazell Nut.

Pinc. -- Why, saw she't?

Want. No, but she felt it; it is an imperfection
In Nature I cannot help, and it is as cold
I warrant as a Cucumber.

Drawf. And rises
So little in your stomach!

Want. Troth, as little
As may be sir; how shall I heat it Gentlemen?

Drawf. Drink wine and Drab.

Want. Why, so I do you know;
Yet when the flame of drinking's o'r, I fall
Into the Noose of Taverns, like a Pigeon.

Pinc. Only then y'ad best fight when you are drunk.

Want. And so.
Be hanged when I am sober; no, I bear
Too great a Conscience.

Drawf. If it be a burden
Too hard to bear, we will teach you how to throw
It off, and live as we do without any.

Want. Take up this quarrel Gentlemen, and have
My heart for ever.

Pinc. What to do, to throw
The hounds ye starve? yet that so little, 'twill
Not be a mouthfull; it is your money we
Value the most, let your heart go as't came.

Want. Why, I shall mortgage next week.

Pinc. Are you serious?
May we give credit to you?

Want. I Have occasion.

Drawf. Thou shall have more rather than want; my Buliy,
We are thy Guardians, who assaults our ward
Suffers, unless he be on a sure Guard.

Exeunt. ACT. V.

1 Soul. What Mr Doctors! have we found ye? who can cure the Citizen of his
head ach but the Scotch Doctors? who their wives of the Toothache but the
Scotch Doctors? the Scotch Doctor is all in all, the Kirk will take no Physic
but of the Scotch Doctor; the Country will be cheated by none but by the Scotch
Doctor; the Court and Gentry will be beggered by none but the beggarly Scotch
Doctors; come away and be hanged.


Exeunt. Ioc. Bil. Mercy sirs, Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.


Enter Scarefoole running with his Sword drawn. Scar. Hawd, hawd, hawd sir.


[he trembles. Resolu. Nay, I don't intend
To take the advantage of you as I may,
I owe a greater honor to true valor;
I have heard Nobly of your Countrymen,
And therefore to assure my self Report
Lies not, I have exposed my Person to
This single hazard.

[he trembles. Scar. A sir* I dee leov you.

Resol. And I shall love you too, if that I find
You prove as Gallant as you have spoke your self:
Consider what dependances are on you,
Whom you have involved by your large promises
To this Engagement; let them see you dare
Do something for their money.

Scar. Be me saw sir
You Are a mickle Gallant mon, Ise thra me swerd an heart at your non feet sir.


Resol. That Is base, not Souldierlike; submissiveness
In this Case speaks you Coward, and if so,
My breath has been ill spent; what, will you fight?

Scar. Noot a neustye sir, geod feith I leove a Anglish mon wy aw my heart. A

And not fit for a Noble Treaty, take
This, this, and this.

Resol. A Gentleman, a Swineheard, hangye, go,
[kicks him. The Bubbles broke, the wind gave Being to.
Exeunt. Within. You Are welcome Gentlemen, show a Room there Boy.

Enter Trapheire, Witwud, Townshift, and Drawer. Tra. Sirrah, there will some
Gentlemen ask for us,
Direct 'em hither.

Draw. I shall sir; what is your wine?

Town. Sack, Boy, the quickening sack; and such Tobacco
As may inspire a spirit into clay,
Quick, and as sharp as lightning.

Wit. Oh good sir,
I cannot endure to think upon a storm;
Talk not of lightning, it does bode some quarrelling;
The calmest language is the best, when there is
A peace intended.

[Enter Drawforth, Pinckcarcase, Wantwit, and Drawer with wine. Tra. Here they
come; now Coz
For your honor seem somewhat averse
To an agreement; carry your self stoutly,
With an unaltered Countenance.

Wit. It Is not in
The power of humane frailty.

Tra. -- Gallants, welcome;
You Are men I see for Credit.

Want. What must I say?

Drawf Carry your self manly.

Want. What would I give now for an Inch of manhood;
How he does eye me; would I had a look
[Drawf Tra. Town, and Pinck whisper. But half so piercing, I Would encounter then
With Basilisks; It carries daggers in it
Will penetrate a Coat of Male; there is
[Witwud and Wantwit stare at one another. No safety but in distance.

Wit. How he looks at me!
With such a hungry countenance, as though
He meant to satisfy himself upon me;
But if he knew but what a piece of flesh
He had to deal with, he would not be so greedy;
I was not cut out for a Royster; sure
Nature never meant me for the field, unless
To call my Cattle home, or try my hounds.
I am so great an enemy to a sword
I wear none when I ride; Oh, how yon fellow
Would spurn me, like a Mushrome, could he get
Me but alone; but he shall be hanged first.

Tra. What, all this while and speak not to each other?
Why, you have hearts of Oak: Not bow, dear Coz!

Wit. I cannot help it.

Town. Come, we must have you friends.

Want. With all my heart sir.

Wit. How Is this? the man's bewitched;
See what the Gold can do!

Wit. If you please sir, I am your humble servant.

Tra. And what say you Coz?

Wit. Hum, I smelt, it is so,
The fellow is a Coward on my life.
Are they not all so? it is a blessing then.

Drawf. Come sir, our friend is willing to pass by
All the affronts you gave him, if you will wave
His Challenge.

Wit. I Will wave nothing but my Sword
Against my Enemy.

Town. Shall we be friends?

Wit. A friendly blou^d runs not yet current in me;
Be challenged by a dunghill Cock? I scorn it.

Tra. Why, this is rare! Coz, I Will spit in thy mouth.

Pinc. Sir, it is your friends desire as well as ours
To prevent bloodshed.

Wit. -- Let such things as you,
That dare not waste their blood be sparing on it;
For my part, I Will not value if he Tap
From me a Pailefull.

Tra. Who the Devil Conjured
Up such a spirit in him?

Pinc. Your friend's grown --
Take him down, or by this light
I Will kick him.

Tra. Pough, let me alone for that.

Want. The Gentleman grows angry, I Will be gone.

[to Drawforth. Drawf. Hang him, a Coward, a mere Coward, friend*

Want. How, a coward! he speaks not like one;
I would his hands were tied behind him, I
Would make a trial on it; but he has teeth
Strong as the tusks of Boares, and legs more stiff
And big then any Bedspost, I should do
no good upon him.

Tra. Come Coz, throw
Your Ranting habit off, the Scene of War
Is past, and now put on your Robe of Amity,
The Bride-garment of Peace.

Wit. -- Peace! who shall peace?
It Is sawciness to tell me so.

Tra. How Is this!
You worm! 'slight, if I lay my hands
Upon you once, I Will tear you into nothing*
You Cowardly simple Puppy. Sir, I Will --

[he takes him by the shoulder. Wit. Not so loud good Coz;
You know I have but followed your directions.

Tra. Be hanged, and overdone it, have not you sirrah?
The Gentlemen shall know you have not spirit
To look a Cat in th'face, if that you ben't
More sociable.

Wit. -- Good Cozen, I Will do any thing.

Tra. Well, I have brought him to it with much ado;
[takes Want. Here, shake hands, sir; you must be friends.

by the hand and brings him to Witwud. Wit. Well, if I must, I must, patience
is a virtue,
And I Will embrace it -- I am your friend sir.

Want. I shall never be your foe sir.

Wit. So said, and so done sir, will do well.

Tra. The Rascal acts it handsomely.

Pinc. To your credit:
Ours is the silliest Rogue.

Drawf. Boy, more wine;
[Enter Drawer. Would we had Music here to celebrate
This Nuptial.

Draw. I will send for some.

Tra. Do so; come, here is to the Married Couple.

Wit. I do believe we both cannot got a Boy
[Enter Fiddlers. Will prove a Soldier.

Pinc. Let Us have a good Air, but drink first.

Town. Drink about Gallants, what the Music duls you;
Have e're a new song fellow?

Fid. Yes, of the Scots coming into England.

I shall return you Answer by this Messenger.

[Drawes. Wit. Good Coz no fighting; I will drink a Gallon
Rather than lose one drop of blood -- It is
Too precious for the floor to drink.

[Enter Drawer. Draw. Gentlemen your noise has drawn Soldiers into the house,
th'a^e coming up; as many as can get into that little Closet,


Pinc. I would not be in custody for a Million;
The Rode, the Rode --

[Tra. Pinc. Town, and Drawf. yet in. Drawf. That Is all our faults, in, in.

Wit. Where shall we be?

Enter Soldiers. Soul. Where Is all these Huffs -- what you two make this

night for you to rant in? come you must with us.


Exeunt. Want. Nay good Gentlemen.

Enter Drawer. Draw. Gentlemen, you may come forth, the coast is clear.


Tra. Where Is the two Gentlemen?


Draw. They have taken 'em with 'em.


Pinc Did they pay the Reckoning.


Draw. No sir.


Tra. A pox upon you, why did you not aske'em for it?


Draw. I durst not sir, for fear they should say, the rest of their Company
was above.


Pinc. It Is right, the Devil's on it, this was your doing Trapheire, Will you

Tra. Not a penny, I Will keep unto my Oath, throw who shall dip or pay if you

Tra. Death! but thirty say thou? well, there it is;

Town. Why, this was handsome Trapheire.

Exeunt. Enter 2 or 3 Servitors. Ser. Make room for the Magistrates;
The Prisoners
Enter Do-much, Surebold, Resolution, Scarefoole, Iocky, Billy, Smallfaith, and
his Wife, Soonegul'd and his Wife, Anything, Downfall, Worn-out, Seminary,
Public Notary. There --

Do. Which are
The Prisoners?

Resol. These sir.

Ioc. Bil. Mercy, mercy, Master Judge.

Sure. What are those?

Resol. The subjects on the which these Villains practiced their subtilties
and deceits; first, I shall tender my Charge against 'em, then produce my
evidence.


Do. Very well, very well, proceed.

Resol. In brief (Sir) then they have infected most
Part of this Nation; here is a thing,
A man of Reputation once, and bore
[Pointing to Small. A place amongst you.

Sure. I do pity him.

Resol. And now is fit for no place except Bedlam:
Here is another, a man you would think
[to Anything The Devil could not work upon, and yet
These Scotch ones have. The Lawyer, father of
Contrivances, is noos'd in one himself;
He cannot stand without his Crutches, and
His head's so light his nose is every minute
Ready to touch the ground.

Sure. What is that Gentleman?

[To Worn-out. Resol. Do you conceive him one? have they left ought
Upon him like a Creature? may we swear
He is a perfect man, no Ghost? it is hard.
The hurryings he has had with sleepless eyes,
Continual Purgations, Bleedings, what not,
That they could but invent to bring him low;
He Is all is left of a Courtier, and deserves
Your pity; there is no double doors betwixt
His heart now, and your eyes; he is so transparent
You may see through him. It Is not these alone
They Have brought to this, but all the Country people,
Both Common sort, and Gentry.

Do. What say you for yourselves?

Ioc. Bil. Mercy, mercy, mercy, wees leove tha Anglish mickle we will.


Sure. Yes, it appears so; we will requite your Loves,
But cannot say, with your own Coin, because
You never were worth any, but we will find
A way to pay you home.

Resol. When they had thus
Spread their infection, they begin to think
Their safety would not last without the Soldier;
And to that end and purpose does persuade
The giddy People, which they had before
Distempered, with their Poisons, to receive
This man of Feather, as their grand Protector:
They take him, and to Covenant they go;
Two hundred thousand pounds! (a sum would buy
Their Kingdom) must be raised and paid to them.

Do. Very fine.

Resol. But mark sir the event,
I am resolved to open what they did
For all this Money.

Do. 'Twill do well indeed.

Resol. They gave a piece of Paper, in the which
Were strange things promised then, As if that all
The Courage of the world contracted were
In their, and but their Nation.

Sure. And what found you?

Reso. I now proceed to that; I found'um sir,
Like Bull-rushes, that tremble if the wind
But blow on them, they run and tumbled over
The necks of one another, like to tiles
A storm forces from houses tops; this any thing
But man, who owned the name of their Protector,
In the most abject'st manner, and beneath,
The Spirit of a man, threw at my feet.
His Sword, and himself too, on single terms,
Without a stroke; Scarefoole they call him, and
They must be Citizens or none that fear him;
A Rat shall make him run to his own Country.

Scare. Ise a Gentlemon sir, mind ye me? Ise gange toll me non
Contre wy aw me heart gif ye wul.

Sure. Not in such haste sir, we will reserve you for
Another purpose -- take him hence to prison.

Scare. The faw Deele fire thot tongue.

[he is carried off. Reso. What think you sir that Paper, cost so much,
Is worth in weight? here is one will tell you sir.

Pub. No. I am a public Notary by profession,
And dare speak nothing but the truth; the wager
Past on this Gentleman's side, the Popes Bull weighed,
It down by much, the other was not worth
In weight a Penny loaf.

Omnes. Ha, ha, ha!

Sure. But what make you here sir?

Sem. Not to do harm sir.

Do. Stay not here upon
Your peril sir, your Bulls have too long tails.

Sem. I stay but for a wind sir.
Exit Seminary.
Soon. I must confess we have been much deluded,
Cheated, and Cozened by these perjured Scots,
Under the show of zeal and honesty.

Lay. Hang 'em Rogues, they complain they are pillaged, you made 'em not bare
enough sirs, you should have taken their skins off too, they would have made
monsters of us, but truly my husband is a Natural man, and I am his own wife;
I hope you do not think we are otherwise than we should be.


Mrs Small. I have a husband here too, help his head, he was a Man once, and I
was a Woman, as this Gentleman the Courtier knew well enough, but now I am
nobody, thank yo^ pick-purses; Pray spare 'em not, I Am sure they would not
spare me when time was, do what I could.


Sure. Take them hence, there will be order shortly
To pack 'em to some foreign parts, they are
But Caterpillars, and what place soever
They come at will be the worse for it; take 'em hence.

Ioc. Bil. A mercy, mercy, mercy.

Exeunt Scots. Omnes. You have done Justice.

Sure. You Have seen these Scots desected, Gentlemen,
And what d' you find 'em now to be, but Rascals?
Mere Mountebanks, that has instead of Cure
Bred strange Diseases, and distempers amongst you;
Juglers, that looked you in the face, and told
You a fine tale, to keep your senses busy,
While they did pick your Pockets.

Lay. Our Pockets say you sir? I, and something else too, could
They have come at it; but soft, soft, two words to a bargain.

Sure. Master Smallfaith, we shall do what lies in us,
Upon your Recantation, to bring
You into favor with the Common Wealth,
And seat you as before, as Capable
Of her Preferment.

Small. I thank you.

His Wife. Blessing on your hearts.

Sure. We make the same profession sir to you,
On the like terms. You may do much
Upon the giddy People, by the example
Of your own Reformation.

Any. Sir, I shall
Do what befits an honest man (abused)
And servant to the Common Wealth.

Do. And you sir,
Are not exempted here the benefit
Of favor if you will take hold of it.

Soon. I thank you.

Lay. I, and hold it fast husband; had I a good thing to handle, I Would make much
on it a long time I warrant you.


Sure. As for these Gentlemen here, Master Downfall,
And Master Worn-out, we shall do our best
To set the one upon his legs again;
And restore the other, though not to his full
Ability, yet to a health contentable.

Down. Worn. We are your servants.

Sure. When all our minds and hearts are firmly knit,
Let the Scot do his worst, by Sword or Wit.

Exeunt. FINIS.
