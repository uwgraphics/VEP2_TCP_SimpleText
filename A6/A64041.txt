TO THE KINGS MOST Excellent Majesty, The humble Petition of the Gentry,
Ministers, Freeholders, and other Inhabitants of the County of YORK.
SHOWS,
THat this particular County (most affectionate to your Majesty's service)
has well nigh for three years last past been the stage whereon the tragical
miseries (which necessarily accompany and associate War and Armies) have been
represented and acted, whereby the general wealth and plenty of this County
is exhausted and brought very low; which weight of miseries are sensibly
become much more heavy by reason of your Majesty's distance in residence, and
difference in Councels from your great Council the Parliament, begetting great
distempers and distractions throughout the Kingdom, and have specially amongst
us produced factions and divisions; drawing to these parts great numbers of
discontented persons, that may too justly be feared to affect the public ruin
for their private advantage. All which evils are daily fomented and grown more
formidable by your Majesty's drawing together (as we conceive, not according to
Law) many Companies of the Trained Band, and others both horse and foot of
this County, and retaining multitudes of Commanders and Cavaleers from other
parts, and by the daily resort of the Recusants and persons disaffected in
Religion to your Majesty's Court at York; and by the great preparations of
Armies and other warlike provisions, which begets in us fears of wars, to the
great terror and amazement of us your Majesty's peaceable Subjects, and the
great decay of all commerce and industrious courses for the wealth and
prosperity of the Country, specially of clothing, which is the maine
subsistence of this County, and is since your Majesty's residence with us, and
the following distractions thereupon suddenly obstructed, insomuch that many
thousand families who are of, and have their livelihood by the trade of
clothing, are at the point of utter undoing, which inevitably with prove to be
of dangerous consequence, and will be the inlet to our approaching and
unavoidable ruin, unless your Majesty please graciously to give redress, by
removing the causes which produce these miserable effects: it being too true,
that very many in these, and other parts of the Kingdom, do wholly withdraw
themselves from their former commerce and dealing, and others, both Merchants,
and Chap-men, do now generally refuse to make payment for goods long since
sold and delivered, alleging, that others refuse to pay them for any commodity
formerly sold; til the fears and distractions of the Land be settled, which if
not suddenly prevented, will forthwith overturne all such ways of advantage
and comfort, as have formerly made this Kingdom (and this County in
particular) prosperous and happy.

We do therefore in all humility and duty, in the sense of our present
deplorable condition: beseech your Majesty to pardon us, if we importune your
Majesty more then others, since we have endured, and are in hazard more then
any: and that from these apprehensions we may offer to your Majesty our earnest
Petitions, for redress, and prevention of these evils, daily threatening danger
to your Majesty, and destruction to us, which we conceive is impossible any
other way to be effected, then by your Majesty's entertaining a right
understanding betwixt your self and Parliament, and affording your gracious ear
and consent to such Councels and propositions, as shall be tendered by them to
your Majesty, for the honor and greatness of your Majesty and posterity,
and the good of this Church and Kingdom: and by your Majesty's declining all
other Councels whatsoever, and uniting your confidence to your Parliament: and
that your Majesty would in no way think fit to put us upon that rock of
dividing the duty we owe to your Majesty, your Parliament, and the whole
Kingdom, (to which we are so deeply engaged by our protestation, which your
Majesty (to our knowledge) never dissented fr^o, not declared against and that
whilst your Majesty expects our performance in one part thereof, we may not
(being equally engaged) impeach at all or in the least degree, go less then
our duty in the other, which (we stand resolved of) by no means either of
fear or favor to be drawn to do. And that your Majesty would take into
consideration, that your Parliament being the supreme Judicatorie of your
Kingdom, the very essence thereof must of very necessity be destroyed, if
their Counsels and determinations be subjected to alteration, or reversall by
the Counsels, or opinions of any private persons, how learned or judicious
soever; and seeing your Majesty has most graciously passed an Act that this
Parliament shall not be dissolved, nor adjourned, without consent of your
Majesty, and both Houses: We do humbly beseech your Majesty, to take into
your gracious and provident thoughts that nothing may be done tending
thereunto: and that the Lords and great Officers now called hither by your
Majesty's command, may speedily return to the high Court of Parliament,
whereby it may be evident to the world, that your Majesty intends not to
decline the Law so inacted; and that since your Majesty has graciously
declared your confidence in the affections of this County, your Majesty would
not think it fit an extraordinary Guard should be raised thereout, and the
Cavaleers, and others of that quality still continued about your Majesty (as
men most useful, and as if kept for some design) they not having (for ought we
know) either entrest in, or affections to the public good, their language and
behavior, speaking nothing but division, and war, and their advantage,
consisting in that which is most destructive to others.

And lastly, that since your Majesty has called in this County to attend your
Majesty this day; your Petitioners do most humbly supplicate that none either
Cavaleers, or others (who in truth have not present fortunes in this County)
may be admitted into any meeting this day, concerning the public business
thereof; or hereafter into any present vote or consultation when any further
meeting may be, to prepare and consider of some fit answer to what your
Majesty shall propound, we humbly conceiving it neither just nor equal (but a
thing to be protested against) that any whosoever should be thrust upon us, as
men of this County, that are not either by their fortune or residence any
part of us.

And now your Petitioners do most heartily pray, that the God of heaven, in
whose hands are the hearts of Kings, would this day incline your Majesty's
heart, seriously to consider these present and imminent miseries that this your
Kingdom lies under, in the peace whereof (visibly under God) consists the
preservation of the Protestant Religion the redemption of our Brethren in
Ireland, and the establishing of that Kingdom to your Majesty and posterity,
from those desperate and unparaleld Rebels, that so your Majesty might
graciously grant these your Petitioners humble desires which (whatsoever will
be said to the contrary) your Petitioners are well assured, would abundantly
redound to the glory of God, the honor and safety of your Majesty, the good
of your Posterity, and the only probable means under God, with peace and
plenty, to make this your Kingdom happy, besides the happy acquisition of
your peoples hearts, the greatest treasure of Princes, all which will
gloriously represent your Majesty's lively portraiture, of him who is the
fountain of Wisdom and piety, to whom we shall ever pray for your
Majesty's long and prosperous Reign.

To the right Honorable, the Lords and Commons in the High Court of Parliament
assembled.
The humble Petition of the Gentry, Ministers, Freeholders, and other
inhabitants of the County of York, assembled there at His Majesty's command,
the third of June. 1642.
We being resolved humbly to petition His Majesty for the redress of those
grievances which we now lie under, did desire to have met in the Castle-yeard
at York, we conceiving it the fittest place to consider of such public
affairs as concerned the County, which we were not only denied of, but charge
was given to the Officer there, that we should not have admittance, and when
we assembled upon the place appointed by his Majesty, and did acquaint the
County there met with the form of a Petition, the sense whereof the formerly
approved of, and then upon the reading thereof, generally consented to, and
desired the same should be presented to his Majesty, we were violently
interrupted by the Earl of Linsey, who with a great Troup attending him, in an
imperious way, snatched out of a Gentle-mans hand of good quality, a Coppie of
the forenamed Petition which at the desire of the Country he was reading to
them, and some of his Lordships company laid hold of his Bridle and Cloak,
hailing him in great fury, and said, You are a company of traitorous Rogues
and Villains, and often lifted up his Cane, as if he would have struck him.
And also a Knight of this County was affronted by the Lord Savile, upon his
reading the draught of a Petition to himself, upon the place aforesaid, the
day above: First, his Lordship told him it was a Pamphlet, which he denied,
thereupon the Lord Savile demanded it of him, which he refused to deliver, his
Lordship laid hands upon his Sword, and almost plucked him from his Horse, upon
which the said Knight fearing some mischief would be done him, delivered the
same: And then the said Lord Savile told him, he labored to sow seeds of
sedition, and if he would fight, there should be fighting enough, and many of
the said Lord Savil's company held uptheir Canes at him, and one of them said,
Hold your prating, It were good to Cane you: Which provocations, had not the
people been peaceably inclined, might have produced bloody effects.
Notwithstanding all which, and diverse others insufferable injuries, so
confident were we of his Majesty's former professions, never to refuse any
Petition presented by his people to him in an humble way, that we desisted not
to wait our best opportunity, to present the said Petition to his Majesty:
(a Coppie whereof we here humbly present unto your grave considerations which
his Majesty notwithstanding pleased not to accept of.

We therefore humbly desires these Honorable Houses well to weight these
particulars, and to take such course therein as may tend to the preservation of
our Liberties, and the peace of the Kingdom. And that you would please to
address your selves to his Majesty on our behalf, that through your
wisdoms our Desires may find better acceptance with his Majesty.

And we shall heartily pray, etc.
Monday the sixth of June. 1642. P. Merid.
THe Lords and Commons observing not only the wisdom, but the affections of
the County of York expressed in these Petitions, and likewise that they cannot
be discouraged from their constant fidelity to the Laws and Government of this
Kingdom, which have their Life and being from the Parliament, have thought it
fit to declare their good acceptations of their affections, assuring them that
they will interest themselves in this their Demands, which tends to the honor
and safety of his Majesty, the peace of his Kingdom, and may prove an
effectual means to keep us from the desperate mischiefs those Lords that
opposed this Petition would have brought this Kingdom into.

FINIS.
