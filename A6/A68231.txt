Here begins the book of Cato both in Latin and English.
SI deus est animus nobis vt carmina dicunt.
Hic tibi praecipue sit pura me^te colendus.
For thy that god is inwardly the wit
Of man, and geuith him understanding
As dite is said, therefore shall thou vnshitte
Thine heart to thy sovereign lord and king
Principally above all other thing:
Giving him laud honor and reverence,
Which has endowed the with exulence.
Plus vigila semper nec somno deditus esto,
Nam diuturna quies vicijs alimenta ministrat.
A wake my child, and love no slogardie:
In long sleep and look thou never delight,
If thou purpose, to worship for to stie.
Long sleep and sloth, to vices men exite,
It makith dull, it makith inperfite
It fosterich up the filthes of the flesh,
It wastith eke, and pallith blodes fresh.
Virtutem primam puta, esse, compescere linguam.
Proximus ille deo, qui sit ratione tacere.
Trust well also, the first of virtues all,
As to be still, and keep thy tongue in mewe:
Of tongue untied much harm may fall:
Leave me well, this is as gospel true,
Who can dalians of tongue esshewe,
And rest with reason, this is the vray text
To god above that man is alder next.
Sperne repugnando tibi tu contrarius esse.
Conueniet nulli, qui secum decidet ipse.
Auyse the well, that thou never trauerse
Thine own sentence, for thereof comes shame.
Say not one and eft contrary rehearse,
such repugna^ce, will make thy honourlame
Where stedfastnes, will cause y^ good fame.
For he shall never accord with man alive:
That we himself, will ay repugne and strive.
Si vitam inspicias hominum, si denique mores.
Cum culpas alios, nemo sine crimine viuit.
If thou advertise and behold about,
The life of men, and the manners also,
Both of thy self, and other there without
In myddell earth, thou shall find, who
That in some part, is to virtue fo.
Blame no man therefore, if thou do right:
Since in earth lacles, lives no wight.
Quae no citura tenes, quamuis sint chara relinque.
Vtilitas opibus, praeponi tempore debet.
If y^ suppose things shall annoye and grieve,
Though they be dear and of right great price,
Such as suffers not thy profit
If the lust to be ruled, as the wise
Abstain the from such things in all wise.
For it is more wisdom in sothfastnesse,
To prefer profit, than such richesse.
Constans and leuis, vt res expostulat esto.
Temporibus mores, sapiens sine crimine mutat.
It is a good lesson for the nones,
A wight now to be te^pred with co^ffaunce,
And to be merry and glad eftsoon:
Not always sad, ne light of countenance.
A man's chere may full often auaunce:
For at each time, as the thing requires,
So the wise man visageth and chereth.
Nil timere vxori de seruis creed querenti.
Soepe etenim mulier, quem coniunx diligit odit.
Give not credence always to thy wife,
That for her ire, and her vnpacience
With sharper tongue, tha^ is sword or knife,
Playneth on thy servant, though no offense
Thou find in him: learn well this sentence
The wife will hate, and cause for to smerte
Oftimes him, her husband loves we heart.
Cumque mones aliquem, nec sevelit esse moueri.
Si tibi sit charus, noli desistere coeptis,
And if thou warn a wight of his forfayte:
Although he grudge with frowing cou^tena^ce
And in his language; manace the and thrate:
Yet forbere not for all such displesaunce.
To teach him to amend his governance
As thou began, corecte that is amysse,
And that is a friendly tuche ywysse.
Contra verbosos noli contendere verbis.
Sermo datur cunctis animi sapiencia paucis.
Against the wordy folk ay full of wind,
Strive not at all, it may the not profit:
Such Iayissh people, ben in co^ceites blind
The witless word, avails not a myte.
In many words, is wisdom often full lyte.
For to every wight, is given speech,
And yet the wise full often ben to seche.
Dilige sic alios, vt sis tibi charus amicus.
Sic bonus esto bonis, ne te mala damna sequantur.
Love other men, and have them so in chere
That to thy self, thy love may most exte^de:
Let no person, be to the more dear
Than thy estate, for the^ shall thou offend.
And hurt thy self and other folk amend.
But ay love other and cherysshe them fo,
That to thy self thou be not founden foo.
Rumores fuge, ne incipias nouus author haberi.
Nam nulli tacuisse nocet, nocet esse locutum.
Rumors new that flyen as the wind,
Eschew my child with all thy diligence:
Be never besy, new tidings to find,
Such nouelte, causes often offense,
It is no wit it is no sapience.
It hurts not a man to be in peace,
But it does harm, to put his to^g in preace
Rem tibi promissam, certain promittere noli.
Rara fides ideo, quia multi multa loquuntur.
Make no promise of other men's behelfe,
Remebre the well, that promise is unsure:
And but thou keep thine, thy name y^ sleest,
To serve thy behest do thy besy cure.
Trust not the word of every creature,
Some men's feyth is easy to break:
For many folk think not, as they speak.
Cum te aliquis laudat, iudex tuus esse memento.
Plus alijs de te, quam tu tibi credere noli.
With words fair, when fauel sedeth the:
Be thou not blind, for all his false flattery,
Let thine own reason always, thy judge be.
And in effect, if thine estate be hie,
though fauel with his craft, would blind thine eye,
In all thy life, thou never gene credence,
More to thy self, than to thy concience.
Officium alterius, multis narrare memento.
Atque aliis cum tubenefeceris ipse sileto.
When thou see another man's deserte,
As for his good deeds comendable,
In every place prsuie and perte,
Such a wight, with thy good word enhable.
And though you have been right amyable,
Of thy good deed, make thou none-auau^ce:
And than other me^, shall thy name enhau^ce.
Multorum cum facta, senex and dicta recentes.
Factibi succurrant, iuuenis quae feceris ipse.
And thou liuelo^g, an old man shall thou be,
Age will aproche, maugre in who say nay.
Than aperceyue, behold about and se,
How aged folk been entreated every day,
And so to puruoye for thy self assaye,
Into stouping age when thou art crept,
Thing may y^ help, y^ in yougth was kept.
Ne cures si quis tacito sermon loquatur.
Concius ipse sibi, de se putat omnia dici.
Care not, although some men speak soft,
Ne change no chere: for often it is full bet
In secret wise to speak, than cry on loft
A man should s^ always where he were set,
And after that so should he speak or let.
But to the suspect of harm it seems,
Men speak of him, he none other demeth.
Cum fueris felix, quae sunt aduersa caueto,
Non eodem cursu, respondent vltima primis.
When fortune, has given them felicite,
And set the on hie, than ware of a fall,
Than sueth often, full sharp aduersite,
Falls fortune turns as does a balle,
In her have thou no sekernes at all.
Her perilous play, sumtime turns to gra me:
The End is woo, of that began with game.
Cum dubia et fragilis, sit nobis vita tributa.
In mortem alterius, spem tu tibi ponere noli.
Our bretel life, is here so full of doubt,
That in very surerye no wight may stand
Lo suddenly crepeth the souls out,
All aboutes this world in every land
Of young and old: for every wight is bound
To death: therefore set not thine affiaunce
In death of him, there may suruine pchau^ce.
Exi guum munus cum det tibi pauper amicus.
Accipito placide, plene et laudare memento.
A little gift, given with good intent,
Of thy friend y^ lives in pouerte,
With right good chere, such gifts take and hent,
Supposyng ay, that as good will has he
And more, than many men that rich be.
Praise not the gift, ne pondre not the price
Thentent is good and that shall the suffice.
Infantem nudum, cum te natura creauit.
Paupertatis onus, pacienter far memento.
Sith nature, that was thy first norice,
Has brought the hither all naked and bare,
Though thou can never richesse acco^plice,
But you art hold, always in pouerties snare:
Yet no force make never to much care,
Take patiently pouerte for the best,
Riches is not of nature, but of queste.
Ne timeas illam, que vite est vltima finis.
Qui mortem metuit, quod viuit perdit idipsum.
Though death be fine of every creature,
And no wight on live, may it escape,
Yet dread not death with ouerbesy cure.
To live in earth, than is it but a Iape,
If thou after death always so gape.
Think well to die, but modifie thy thought
Or else to live, avails the right naught.
Si tibi pro meritis, nemo rn^det amicus
Incusare deu^ noli, sed te ip^e coherce.
For thy desert, if no wight thank the,
I mean, wha^ you have done thy force and pain
To other folk friendly for to be:
If they can not to the gramercy said,
Withdraw thy self, and so thy hand refrain
Blame not thy god, for their vnfre^dlinesse:
But for such folk, do afterward the less.
Ne tibi quid desit, quaesitis vtere parce
Vtque quod est serves, semper tibi deesse putato.
Since y^ no rich man, lives there any where
If he consume his goods all and wast,
But y^ pouerte shall grieve him sore and dear:
Therefore my child, such goods as y^ have,
Let not to s^ne, out of thy hand be raft,
Lest y^ thy goods hereafter will the fail:
Hold that thou have, it may the often avail.
Quod praestare potest, ne bis promiserisvlli.
Ne sis ve^tosus, du^vis bonus ip^e videri
Behete no man a thing, to lene him twyse,
And fail him, that is but vilany.
If thou may lene, do it in friendly wise,
Such cheuissau^ce, will frendlynesse bewrie.
Of thy good deeds, clamor not necrie,
Be not wordy ne of words breme,
If a good man, the lust to apere and seem.
Qui similar verbis, nec cord est fidus amicus.
Tu quoque fac simile, sic ars deluditur art.
And if thou find, the son of doubleness,
The false flatterer, if thou epsy,
with painted word, and heart full of falsnesse:
Thou may in no wise better blere his eye
Than serve him with his own treachery.
For words fair, and frendlynesse no part:
Give him the same, and art begile with art.
Noli homines blandos nimium sermon, probare.
Fistula dulce canit, volucrem dum decipit auceps.
Preue not a man, with over peynted speech,
Under fair words, is often covert gile.
The word is gay, but friendship is to seche,
And as men say, such craf is in this isle:
some think harm, wha^ they her to^ges file
The whystling fowler, makes merry song
And yet the birds, begileth he among.
Cum tibi sint nati, nec opes: tunc artibus illos.
Instrue, quo possint inopem defendere vitam.
When ye god has given the children feel,
And riches small, than do you in this wise.
Teache thy children with crafts for to dele,
That by their art, they may the^self cheuise.
If you do thus, tha^ workest thou as the wise,
Craft is good, and craft is lucratife,
By craft, they may defend the nedy life.
Quod vile est, caru^: quod carum est, vile putato.
Sic tibi nec cupidus, nec auarus nosceris vlli.
Have this conceit, for it is often saine,
Things dear, shall often abate of pryse:
And things that of little value been
In time coming, may to derth arise,
Remember this, and it well advertise:
Thus shall thou best, ye name of chincherye fleme
And other me^, shall y^ no nigarde deem.
Quae culpare soles, ea tune feceris ipse.
Turpe est doctori cu^ culpa redarguit ipsum.
Auyse the well, let reason be thy guide
When other me^ thou art about to blame,
That such defaute be not in the espyede
For if there be, tha^ shall thou have y^ shame
Ama^s honor such things will reclame.
It is full foull when y^a man will teache
If his own deeds, against his words preche
Quod iustu^ est, petito: vel quod videatur honestu^
Nam stultu^ est petere, quod possitiure negari.
Look thy desire, be grounded in a right
And that it never trauers honest
For as often times as wight
Desires more than right and equite
Than may his request repeled be
And it is clepud nycete and great folly
To ask often that men will ay deny*
Ignotum tibi, tu noli praeponere notis
Cognita iudicio constant, incognita casu.
Change not thy fre^d, that you know of old,
For any new, in trust y^ thou shall find
Better than he: but in thy hands hold
Him, that to y^ has friendly been and kind:
Such changes ben full often blind
Thou wenest to know, and yet know you not a dele
To know a friend, it is full casuale
Cu^ dubio incertis versetur vita periculis
Pro lucro tibi pone die^, quicu^que laboras.
Sith man's life is full of myserie,
Some time in mirth, and after in mischief
Now in the dale, Now in the mount on hie
Now man is pore, and often riches relefe
The shynyng morrow, has often a stormy eve
To this polycie, take heed and entende:
Look thou have lucre in thy labors end.
Vincere cu^ possis, interdu^ sede sodali:
Obsequeo qm^ dulces retinentur amici.
Though you may be venged, and have victory
Of thy friend and fellow, yet you must forbere,
Refrain thy self, be not to haute ne hie:
Irous hastines, full often men does dear,
where easy softnes, friends may conquer,
For by good deeds set in holiness,
Men ben together knet in frendlynes
Ne dubites cum magna petas, impe^dere parua.
Hiis etenim rebus coniungit gratia charos.
The lymytour that visits the wives,
Is wise enough, of him a man may lere,
To give pynnes, purses, and knyues,
This craft is good, so does the sely friar.
Give things small for things y^ ben dear
If y^ receive, give somewhat ay again,
And that will norishe friends dear certain.
Litem infer cave, cum quo tibi gratia iuncta est.
Ira odium generat, concordia nutrit amorem.
Touile not, ne strive with him y^ is thy friend*
Beware of y^, make not thy friend thy foo:
A touyllous man may friendship and shende.
These baratours that been misruled so,
Entryp them self and wrap in much woo.
for Ire of kind, e^ge^dreth naught but hate,
Where as accord, norysheth love algate.
Seruorum ob culpam cum te dolor v^ get in iram:
Ipse tibi moderare, tuis vt parcere possis.
When thy servant thou take in defaute,
Though he can not his negligence excuse,
Yet in thine ire, make not to ^yers assaute:
But with thy haste a while take truse,
Thou shall find ease, this fete if y^ can use.
Rule thy passion ay by such mesure:
That thou save, that been under thy cure.
Quem superare pores, interdu^ vince ferendo:
Maxima etenim morum est, semper patientia virtus.
Sufferau^ce does ease, was said full long ago,
Suffer, and have all thine intent,
Though thou may overcome yet do not so.
Conquer through sufferau^ce, and be pacie^t,
But to foul cruelte never consent.
For it is cleped in virtue excellence,
Awight to live in humble patience.
Conserua potius quae sunt iam parta labor.
Cum labor in damno est, crescit mortalis egestas.
Be not to scant, be not to prodigal,
Conserve thy thing gotten with labor:
It is full fair, to be said liberal,
But eschew wast, and be no surfetoure,
Consume not all thy treasure in an hour,
When of thy labor ryseth none avail:
Nedy pouerte must the full sone assail.
Dapsilis interdum notis et charis amicis.
Cum fueris foelix, semper tibi proximus esto.
Be not like zenola, for he would ete
With every man, and at their feast him feed:
But never man, might tasten of his mete,
No man to him, but he to al men yede.
Be free of mete, but look y^ largesses led
The no ferther, than thou may well attain.
be thin own fre^d, for this says cato certain
Take heed sir, how holsomly this clerk
Entreats men by vertuos doctrine
This first part of his compendious work
In worship howthei shall full clearly shine,
Guyding to renown streght as any line:
whose precepts observe if ye list,
And to his good cou^sail, your hertes incline
Kight in your wealth full well it shall be wist
The virtues four, y^ men should forth co^uey
Lo in this life, as brydel does a beeste,
That men not err in this perilous way,
Stablisshinge him as does a steadfast reest.
As sikur guydes, y^ ben worthyest
Man's living to set in governance,
This sage Cato, full wisely does regest,
Prenteth his sawes in your remembrance.
Here follows the second book of Cato.
TElluris si forte velis cognoscere cultis.
Virgilium legito, quod si mage nosce laboras.
If thou my child set thy delight,
Of earth, to know the tilthe and culture,
And if thou will of knowledge be perfect.
Why some is areable, and some is pasture,
And why some is spreint with flower picture,
I counsel the to musen for a while,
In the laureat poet virgile.
Humanos si forte velis, depellere morbos.
Herbarum vires: macer tibi carmine dicet.
And further more my child, if that the list,
The virtue of herbs for to discriue:
It may never in earth better be wist,
Which be co^suming, which be nutritive,
Which hot, which cold, which conseruatiue:
Tha^ read Macer, in his old dite,
Which tells hem in proper qualite.
Si Romana cupis and punica no scere bella,
Lucanum quaeras, qui martis praelia dicet*
And if thou have destrous fresh courage,
To here of noble Romans worthiness,
How that they vanquished them of cartage,
And many other, through manly prowess:
Than read Lucan, full well can he express,
who bare him best in town and eke in field,
and who did marueiles under macers shield
Si quis amare libet, vel discere amare legengo.
Nasonem petito, sin autem cura tibi hec est.
And he that lust of lovers for to read,
And in that wise him self to auaunce,
As in y^ craft, Naso can teach him speed.
Some loves song, some harp, lute and dau^ce
Some other things diverse of pleasaunce,
Some louen secretly and lust not to be spide,
Some will be known for thus writes Ouide
Vt sapiens viuas: audi que discere possis.
Per quae si motum vitiis deducitur aeuum.
But yet my child if that in adventure,
Thine heart be set to no such manner thing:
Or if it be not all to thy pleasure
That Virgil, Macer, Lucan, and Naso bring,
yet that thou may be wise in thy living.
If the lust to give me audience.
I shall the show doctrine of sapience.
Ergo ades, and quae sit sapientia, disce legendo.
Therefore my child, come to me and lere,
And I shall the show the very treasure
Of sapience, if the lust to here.
And how thou shall, in good estate endure,
And led thy life after gods pleasure.
Therefore come nere, and lere by this reding,
To be a man virtuous in living.
Si potes, ignotis etiam prodesse memento,
Vtilius est regno, meritis acquirere amicos.
There is no wight, that further may report
Of thy good deeds, than the stranger may.
Make him good chere, and show hi^ thy disport:
And he shall utter thy name, this is no nay,
For the unknown, sometime does assay.
Friends ynowe to have, is better thing,
Than is frendles, a man to be a king.
Mitte arcana dei coelumque inquirere quid sit.
Cum sis mortalis, quae sunt mortalia cures.
Of gods mystery and his working,
Make never my child to far inquiraunce,
It is folly to muse upon such thing.
Dispute never thy gods pouruiaunce,
All thing must be under his governance.
Sith thou art man clad in mortalite,
Dispute thou things such as mortal be.
Lingue metum leti, nam stultum est tempote omni.
Dum mortem metuis, amittis gaudia vite.
The dread of death, that is inordinate,
I mean to dread it ay, and never to cese.
Beware of that I counseyle the algate,
For this is as gospel doubtless
True, who dredeth so, is ay myrthles.
When dread of death a man so aggruggith,
It wastes life, and his time abbruggith.
Iratus de re incerta contendere noli.
Impedit ira animum, ne possit cernere verum.
For thing that is to the uncertain,
When thou art wrath, look y^ never strive.
Thy patience easily withdraw and refrain,
For there is no person in earth on live,
But that all reasonlesse he is as blyue,
As besy wrath has kyndled him on fire:
And than he can not deem the crouth for ire
Fac sumptum propere, cum res desiderat ipsa.
Dandum etenim est aliquid, cum tem pus postulat aut res.
As time requires, so make thine expense,
Mesure thy hand, after thy properte
Of thing, of time, and after the presence.
Se that thou spend no more than needs y^,
And that to spend, look thine heart be fre.
A man should do cost, and make his spending,
Considering time, and rewarding the thing.
Quod nimium est fugito, paruo gaudete memento.
Tuta magis puppis, est modico que flumine fertur.
To much is naught of any manner thing,
The mean is good and most commendable,
Than man stands surest here in his living
with mean estate that halt him greable.
Plente and pouerte be not souffrable,
For than is the ship in the sea most sure,
When that the flode excedith not mesure.
Quod pudeat, sociis prudens celare memento.
Ne plures culpent id, quod et displicet vni.
If you know ought yt may turn one to shame,
Keep it secret for nothing it bewrye:
Be not to besy such things to proclaim
And publisshe, as thou know prive.
Make not all men, to gare on the and cry,
Lest mo deprave, wha^ you thy word has sow
that was before to other men unknow,
Non putes prauos hoies peccata lucrari:
Temporibus peccata latent, et tempore patent.
If thou epsy and see a surfetoure,
A thief, a shrewe, of great mysgouernau^ce,
Trust well sumtyme, shall come an hour
when for his deed, shall he suffer penance,
Cursed deed, askyth wreche and vengeance
Though wyckydnesse for time be kept secre
Yet at the last it wol discouerd be.
Corporis exigui vires contemnere noli.
Consilio pollet, cui vim natura negauit.
Though sum time nature have been unkind
And yeuen a man to be of small stature,
Yet my child Remember, and have in mind
That thou never dispice that creature,
For god may send him fortune and good our
As often as they be with good counsel allied,
To who^ yt nature, has great stre^ght denied
Quem scires non esse parem tibi tempore cede,
victorem a victo superare, saepe videmus.
when the hapenyth to trauerce or have ad^
with him thou know not egal to thy might
Thine vttrest power show not such on unto
lest that estsones, he have the in like plight
for it is sin in tournement and in fight.
fortune changith oftene in an hour
And he is discomfet, that erst was victoure
Aduersus notum noli contendere, verbis.
lis minimis verbis interdum maxima cresit.
Of bro^des small, be made these fires great,
withdraw y^ brand, the fire shall eke decrece
Again the known air look you never beat
with words feel, for word distour beth piece*
The man is wise, that can of words cese,
For this is soth as god gas the life,
Of words small, is brad full much strife.
Quod deus intendit, noli perquirere sort.
Quod statuit de te, sine te deliberat ipse.
Dele not with sorcery, ne with surquedry:
In gods hand is all thy sort and state,
Be not about to calcle thy destyny,
If thou be mysbrous or fortunate.
Let god alone, in him is all thy state,
And that him list of the for to purpose:
without the, full well can be dispose.
Inuidiam nimio cultu, vitare memento.
Quae si non laedit, tamen hanc sufferre molestum est.
Beware of envy, with her taches fell,
within thine heart, look that she not rest:
For it is one of the pains of helie.
when she soiourneth in a man's breast,
Than brenneth fenix in his own neste.
and though she may non other man mischeue
Yet Ethua cease not her self to grieve.
Esto fortis animo cum sis dampnatus inique:
Nemo diu gaudet, qui iudice vincit iniquo.
Enforce thine heart, with manly suffrau^ce,
Though judgment against the proceed,
Be not abashed in word ne countenance.
For the oppressoure, falls may rule and led,
The law, but trust me well without dread,
Long to rejoice acheueth he not,
which by means untrue, his goods gat.
Litis praeteritae noli maledicta refer
Post inimicitias iram meminisse, malorum est.
Wrath of old, that should be out of mind,
Be not about to make eft alive.
But the envious has that tache of kind.
Such malice my child, look you never revive,
For ire of old, makes men to strive.
and who remembers old enemyte:
A wicked man, forsooth my child is he.
Ne te collaudas, nec te culpaueris ipse.
Hoc faciunt stulti, quos gloria vexat inanis.
Thy self also, look that thou not preyse,
Ne dispreyse, but let other men alone.
Always after prudence thy words you peyse:
For thine own auau^t, honor getest you none
But a mock, anon as thou art gone.
A man to preyse him self as says the scole,
Or dispreyse much, is token of a fool.
Vtere quesitis modice, cum sumptus habundat.
Labitur exiguo, quod partum est tem pore longo.
When it is time of cost and great expense,
Beware of waste and spend ay by mesure.
who that to keep nor spend no difference
Makes, his goods may not long endure.
The old saw says, mesure is tresure:
For in short time, thy good may slyp away,
That was begotten in many a sundry day.
Incipiens esto, cum tempus postulat, autres.
Stulticiam similare loco, prudentia summa est.
It is no wisdom, always to seem sage,
But sometime to be nyce, and feign folly:
who has this feate shall find advantage.
when time and thing requires that espy,
And than to dissimyle it is pollicye:
Sometime to be unwise in appearance
Among the wise, is called high prudence.
Luxuriam fugito, simul et vitare memento.
Crimen auaritiae: nam sunt contraria famae.
Thy filthy flesh in mouyng bestial,
That fyghteth against the soul within
By force of her entycement sensual,
Eschew my child, and keep the from her gyn:
That act, and grace, be set full far atwyne.
And fle of avarice the wicked fame,
This two it be, that causen evil name.
Noli tu quedam referenti, credere semper.
Exigua est tribuenda fides, quia multi multa lo quuntur.
Believe not every wyghtes saw,
For some report things all otherwise
Than it was done, or any man it saw.
And some have it of custom and of gyse,
To feed folk with flatteryng and lyese.
Give little trust therefore to such spekynges:
For many folk speak many things.
Quod potu peccas, ignoscere tu tibi noli.
Nam nullum crimen vini est, sed culpa bibentis.
If thou surfeit in drink, forget not that,
Auyse the often thou come not in the snare.
withdraw thy hand, feed not thy throat so fat
Drink that suffiseth, and otherwhile you spare.
To much drink makes men of wit bare,
And yet the wine thereof is not to blame.
But the drynker, makes him self lame.
Consilium arcanum, tacito commit so dali.
Corporis auxilium, medico commit fideli.
To thy trusty friend that is ay secre,
Show thy cou^sayl, to him thy heart bewry,
A trusty friend is chefest of preuete.
But it is hard such friends to epsy,
Try out one among a company,
And of thy body betake the cure:
To such a leche, as is trusty and sure.
Successus indignos noli tu far moleste:
Indulget fortuna malis, vt laedere possit,

Forcius vt valeas, interdu^ parcior esto.
Pauca voluptate debentur, plura saluti,
It is a tache, of a deuouryng hounde

Ne nulli placeas dum vis contemnere multos.
When a multitude has given a decre,
Or concluded ought against thine intent,
Trauerse not against the communete:

Dum vigilat: sperat, per somnium cernit idipsum.
Dread no dremes, so says Detronomye,
Though they be caused of complexion,
Or else of any nyced fantasye,
Or of a superflue replection:
For dremes be but falls illusion.

And upon such thing, they dreme when they wynke.

In the which, as yet apperith no picture,
The philosophy says without fable:
So is the soul but a dedly figure,
Till time she be reclaymed with the lure
Of doctrine, and so get her a good habit
To be expert in conyng and parfite.
Commoda multa feres, sin autem spre ueris illud.
Non me scriptorem, sed te neglexeris ipse.
Enprynte my teching, in thy soul steadfast,

Since the fault my son, is then in the,

But do we well, if they say miss they lie.

For to conclude the body unapt:
Than that the soul in ydelnesse be wrapte.

Therefore among take thiu ease and disport.

And you have, riches, and great aboundaunes,

To keep one that will the ayatwire,
He is at ease, that of such one is quyte.
Multorum disce exemplo quae factasequaris
Quae fugias vita est nobis, aliena magistra.
Of other men thy mirror thou shall make
Conform the to that y^ most men appreue,
What y^ shall do, and what thou shall forsake,
A better lesson may thou not contreue,
Than to other monnes deeds releue.

Demyng thy self in thine own judgment.
Multa legas facito, preelectis prelege multa.

Myspende no time, for stouth or for lachesse,
But sometime read in books old and wise,
Read and report, with great attentifnesse:
By redyng, to connyng men may arise.
Than read my son, and connyng accoplise.
These poets write thiges of great marvel,
And of small credence often this is no fail.
Inter conuiuas facsis sermon modestus.
Ne dicare loquax, dum vis vrbanus haberi.
Among friends sitting at feste,
Be curtes and demure of thy langage.

Refrain thy tongue, with all thy besy cure.

And under that, they can both prik and sting.

For than must thou of other beg hastily.
Fac tibi proponas mortem non essetimendam.
Quae bona si non est, finis cum illa malorum est.
Enprent my child, ay sadly in thy mind,
That thou be not of death to sore^ adrade
That shall the from wrechidnesse unbind

Til on thy corpse, thy soul has been full sad
For right as death is fine of ferfulnes:
So is she the end of thy wrechidnes.
Vxoris linguam, si frugi est, far memento.
Namque malum, nec velle pati nec vaelle tacere.
Thy wyfis word suffer and take in gree,

Full often, that of full great prudence is she,
And must be allowed, this is no nay.
Suffer her than and her consete assay,

If you will not suffer, you can not have thy will
Dilige non aegra cha^os pietate parents.
Nec matraem offendas, du^ vis bonus esse parenti.

For your auayl, unto this place retreue,

And restith you here in this harbate.
Behold and se what thing is to your pay,

That ye shall led your life in sekernesse,
Through virtue of this conseruatife:
And eke attain to much worthynesse.
Thus move I you, under protection
Of your good grace, that what time ye read,
Or in this matter have inspection

Straight to good fame, and brig you to her house

Lo all this world, not can ne may suffice.
Commoda naturae nullo tibi tempore deerunt.
Si contentus co fueris, quod postulat vsus.
Nature can with little thing be content,
As ind^ete, a man should never charge
Him self with mete, for many me^ ben shent:
For their receites be so great and large.
Men se alday the little bote and barge,

Cherisshe nature, but hurt her not with weght
Cum sis incautus, nec rem ratione gubernes.
Noli fortunam quae non est, dicere caecam.
If thy thing thou hap to misgouerne.
without reason or any providence,
Than my child of me this lesson learn:
Sith it was thy fortune such expense
To make, but wit it thine own negligence.
for fortune may never compelle the,
Thy good to spend but at thy liberte.
Dilige denarium, sed parce dilige formam.
Quam nemo sanctus, nec honestus captat habere.
Love thy penny, as for thy cheuissaunce,
Not for the ^oigne, to h^^r^deit on an hepe^
For of the prynte, was made an ordinance,
Not for it should in cotres ly and sleep,
But for it should among the people lepe
In chair eschaunge, and who it kepith inn
As for the form, is subject unto sin.
Cum fueris locuples, corpus curare memento,
Eger habet dives nummos, sed no^ habet ipsum.
When thou have plente, and art pecunyal

But of himself, he has no sikernesse.
Verbera cum tuleris, discens aliquando magistri*
Fer patris imperium, cum verbis exit iniram.

But look thy wits thou never apply,
To thing that may not be vaillable
To cast a thing that is not pregnable

Is often said to grieve finally.
Cum te detiniat Veneris damnosa voluptas.

And when thou art disposed inwardly.
To venus acts, than repress thy courage,
Fostre not thy flesh to lustily.
For great diet, makith the flesh outrage,

For fortune is mother of change ablenes,
Ask of his life and of his governance:
For that is prove of greater suffisaunce.

For life of man his fortune does excelle.
Vtere quesitis opibus: fuge nomen auari:
Quid tibi diuitiae pro sunt, si pauper abu^das?
Use well the richesse that thou have by quest
Of avarice the wicked name escheue,
Let not thy good be stopped in a cheste?
Keep not thy stuff ay closed still in mewe?
Such old treasour will make thy sha^e new.

Exerce studium, quamuis perceperis artem,

Though in conyng y^ have full great co^ceyte
Enforce the ay yet to learn more.
The soul it is, that must* be thy receyte,
Kept in the her, with that treasure and store

Body from soul shall have desseueraunce,
Death is end comune to every wight.
Charge not to much therefore of death is chau^ce^
The tribute of death must thou pay of right:

Be not ashamed also my child to lere,

And naught to know, is ay reproueable.
Demissos animo, et tacitos, vitare me mento.
Qua flumen placidum est, forsan later altius vnda
The solleyne still often meneth fraud and gyle,
Of such a man escheue the company
For the still man compassith otherwhile
within his heart, deceyte and trecherye.
In flodes still is water deep and hye,
In stremes soft seming to thy plesaunce,
Often betidith, full unhappy chance,
Cum tibi displiceat rerum fortuna tua rum
Alterius specta, quo sis discrimine ^^peior.
With thy fortune wha^ thou art dischtente
And can not take agree thine adventure,
Behold and feel in thyn auisemnete,
How they sumtyme were as thou as sure,
And more likely in wealth for to endure.
Both of beauty and eke of nobleness:
Have yet fallen down into wrechednesse.
Quod ^otes id tenta, nam littus carpere ren^s.
Tutius est multo, quam, velum tendera in altum
Atempte no thing, that y^ may not suffice,
Pass not thy might, bear not to hie thy sailt
For there is parrell, if that the streme arise,
Certain my child, this without fail,
The vessel small, is at full great avail,
When with his Ore he may to land reche
where the sails hie full often gone to wreche
Contra hominem iustum, praue contendere noli.
Semper enim deus iniustas vlciscitur iras
Against y^ true Just man, brawle not nestriue
For to god above, that is great displesau^ce,
Trust this truly, there is no man onlyue,
That to the just man does dear or greuau^ce,
But at the last god will take vengeance.
And hereof it is good head for to take,
The rightwisman, of god is not forsake.
Ereptis opibus, noli gaudere merendo.
Sed gaude potius, tibi si^ contingat habere.
If extorcion or misauenture,
Have plucked at the and made ye thredbare
Of riches yet do thy force and cure,
Being merry and eschew thought and care.
For freting thought, is a full cursed ^nare:
Come not therein, fortune is unstable,
After pouerce, riches is pregnable.
Cum Venere et Baccho, lis est, co^iuncta voluptas.
Quod lautum est, animo complectere sed fugelites.
Venus is ready, with all her acts vile.
wha^ he bacchus, has sent her in largess,
The tresoure of his hot and fervent I Will.
Therefore my chield thine appetyt repress,
In wynes hot, do not to great excess.
Drink that for thy soul is expedient,
Eschew strif, with mesure be conte^te.
Est iactura grauis, que sunt amitterre damnis.
Sunt quaedam quae far decet patienter amicum
It is an harm, thy goods to forge.
That been in hand, by force or violence,
But yet my child thou must consider who,
And what he is, that does the such offense.
Bitwixt friend and fo, have ay a diffrence.
For in sum caas, thou must a friend forbere,
And suffer him, though he annoye and dear.
Tempora longa tibi noli promittere vitae.
Quocunque ingrederis, sequitur mors corpus, et vmbra.
Be not to sure that thou shall live long,
A wight shall die be he loath or leef.
And as the old so die the young among,
Death stelith on, as does a prive thief.
Lo against death, men find no relief
She is about to make a deuorce,
And folowith ay the shadow of the corce.
Thure deum placa, vitulum sine crescat aratro.
Ne credas placare daeum, dum caedat litatur.
Serve ay thy god with lowly obseruaunce,
with heart entier, with sote smelling encence,
Such facrifice, is most to his plesaunce.
Of calves small that never did offense,
Though thou them sle, they not dispense
with y^, let the^ grove and swinke in thy plough
Thy heart to god is sacrifice enough.
Cede locum laesus, fortunae cede potenti.
Cedere qui potuit, prodesse aliqua^do valebit.
Give place to him that excedeth thy might,
Though you be hurt it may profit perchance.
and seld avails a man for to fight
against such one as passes his puissaunce,
Though he grieve now, yet often he may aua^ce
Full often is said after great duresse,
The mighty man will kithe his gentilnesse.
Cum quid peccaris, castiges te ipse subinde.
Vulnera dum sanas, dolor est medicina doloris.
After thy surfeit and great offense,
Chastise thy self correct that was amys,
Correct thy gylte, amend thy necligence.
Sorrow for sin, a very medicine is
Repent the sore, than art thou saufe iwis.
For physic says, my child I the ensure:
a bitter drink, y^ sharp sickness may cnre.
Damnaris nunquam post longum tempus amicum.
Mutauit mores, sed pignora prima me mento.
If you have found long friendship in a wight.
Full yore ago, though he begin to change
Dispraise him not: me^ bide not in one plight
sometime was abbay, there as now is gra^ge
This worlds course, is wo^dre queinte and strange.
but though y^ man, now be wax unkind:
His old frendshyp remember in thy mind.
Gracior officiis quo sis, magis charior esto.
Ne nomen sub eas, quod dicitur offici perda.
If it ure the in office to be set,
Than be thou gracious to other men
They may report a godly man is met
with such an office, and so good name shall re^ne
About of the, but I ensure the whenne.
The officers are unkind, than say y^ press
Now would god, this man were officelesse.
Suspectus, caueas ne sis miser omnibus horis.
Nam timidis et suspectis aptissima mors est.
Be not suspecte, that is a wicked teache,
The suspecte wight, with coward Iolasy,
In his living is but a very wretch,
Much is amys, and all would he es^y,
He demeth false and fails hertinesse.
His false conceit set in malyncolye
Sleeth him anon: death ends his folly.
Cum fueris seruos proprios mercatus in vsus.
Et famulos dicas, homines tamen esse memento.
If thou have men without liberty,
Such as men clepe the men of bondage,
Though they be under thy cap^^u^^^e,
yet to such men be never so outrage,
If they be holden under thy seruage.
Though they be bound yet very me^ they be:
And so to dele with them, and remember the.
Quam primum rapienda tibi est occasio prima.
Ne rursus quaeras, quae iam negl exeris ante.
Thy first fortune receive with readiness,
Refuse it not though it be scant and small.
It is well better in gree to take the less,
Than refuse it, and after fail of all.
Gifts of fortune take them as they fall.
Forsake them now, and often thou shall the^ need:
Time is to take when men proffer and bid.
Morte repentina noli gaudere maloru^
Foelices obeu^t, quotu^ sine cry vita est
Rejoice not my child in all thy life,
The sodeine death of a cursed man or wretch
when he is dead, the soul may not reuyue,
From pain to joy, y^ sprite may not shretche,
The fyndes hold so sore y^ they may retche.
who lives well full well eke dies he:
That soul is sure of great falicite.
Cum coniux tibi sit, nec res, and fama la borat.
Vitandum ducas inimicum nomen amici.
If thou have a wit in assurance,
Than trust her well, and love her inwardly,
with heart and thought and all thy affiaunc^,
Be not ^^fecte with suspect Ielosy
It no daefa^te in her thou can spy.
And if thy friend tell the such is the fame:
He is a friend and she nothing to blame,
Cum tibi contingat studio cognoscere multa:
Fac discas multa, vites nescire doceri.
When through study and long exercise,
Thou knoweit much and have great co^ning,
yet do thy diligence, in besy wise,
More to cunne it is a wholesome thing.
To great honor, conning may the bring.
And never eschew for to will be taught,
without teaching, science will not be raught.
Miraris verbis nudis me scribere versus.
Hos breuitas sensus fecit coniungere binos.
And if y^ ought maruayle, or lust for to muse,
In naked words why my verses I write,
In no wise I may me better excuse,
Than say my wit so dulle and inparfite,
Ar^ith me thus rudely to endite.
By two and two, my meter for to knytte,
Naught causes me, but simplenes of wit.
Pars quarta et vltima.
Cum ani^ad^^^terem, quum plurimo^ homines grauiter errare.
When I advertise in my remembrance,
And se how many folk err grievously
In the way of virtuous go ^ernau^c^*
I have supposed in my self that I,
Ought to supporte and counsel prudently
Them to be full glorious in syuyng,
and how the^ should the^ self in honor bring*
Legere et n^ intelligere negligere eit.
Therefore my chys^e I shall tethe the,
Harken me well, the manet and the guyse,
How thy souse suward shall acqueinted be
with the good and virtuous in all wise,
Ke^e an conceive, for he to dilpice,
that redith ay and wot not what is mente:
Such redyng is naught but ^yn^e ^pen^^*
Itaque de^^is^plica. Parents ama*
Praise thy god and pray him with all thy heart,
Father and mother have thou in reverence,
Love them well, and be thou never to sm^rt
To here men's counsel but keep the thence
Til thou be called, ^e ^lene without offense*
Salve gladly(...) at be more dig^e
than y^ thy self, thou shall thy place, re^igne.
Magistrum me^ue. Rem tuam custodi.
Dread thy master, thy thing look thou keep
Take heed to thy housh^ld, ay love my wife,
Pleasant words cut of thy mouth ler crepe,
Be not Irous, keep thy behest as life,
Be tempred with wine, but not to excessise,
Thy wives word make none auctorite.
In folly, sleep no more than needs the.
Libros lege, quod legeris memento.
In goodly books sometime shall thou read,
And that thou redist in thy mind it shit^e,
Stir no wight to wrath, lie not I y^ reed
Do well to good, and that wll often be quitte,
Be not wicked ne to the wicked knitte,
Stand in the place of pleting exercise,
Deem the right, be connseyled of the wise.
Troco lude: alias fuge.
Play with a top the dice look thou eschew,
Despise not women, keep them thy behest,
Scorn never wight, for tha y^ shall it rewe,
Covet no man's good, speak few at feste*
Look thy vengeance be ever with the least,

Love every wight, and this shall the auau^nce.
Try before you trippe.
