A new years Gift, entitled, a Crystal glas' for all Estates to look in,
wherein they may plainly see the just reward, for Vnsaciate and Abominable
Covetousness. M.D.LXIX.
According to my custom, daily I did muse,
Upon Gods holy word, which for ever shall endure,
I thought it the best exercise that any man could use,
Daily to be frequented in the Scripture,
The.xii. of Luke I beheld a place both plain and pure,
Giving general warning in saying these words to us,
Beware of Covetousness, says Christ Jesus.
It first confounded Adam being then in Paradise,
Coveting to be as God, and so began to slide,
He presumed to have knowledge, and also to be wise,
Not contented with his state, nor therein did abide,
His coveting (Alas) set him clean beside,
Regarding Satan's words which coueted his transgression
Couetously he presumed, to be his own confusion,
The root of all evil it is, as witnesses the Scripture,
An odious and secret mischief, as any man can sow,
For what Blossom or bud, think ye that can prosper,
Or what Flower or Fruit, did ever man se grow,
But a root it must have first, this full well we know,
Beware therefore of it, for this I do confess,
The original of all sin, must needs be covetousness,
Of all sin couetousenesse, first poluted Adam,
Linked with infidelity, Pride, and disobedience,
Which pestiferous sin, dwells almost in every man,
For lack of grace, constancy, and good intelligence,
So we like Adams children, forgetting our obedience,
Seking our destruction, without cause or reward,
Like Achab, and Iezabell, coveting Nabothes vineyard.
Thus covetousness slew Naboth against all right,
The nature of it is such, it never was found good,
Woe be to the covetousness thou woeful wight,
That without all mercy, so can thirst for blood,
Thou broughtest the general Deluge at Noes Flud,
And Gehezie by covetousness, if ye harken to this song,
Became a foul Lipper, even all his life long.
King David by covetousness deceived was,
And by concupiscence the story does testify,
In coveting the only wife of Vrias,
Greatly offended Gods divine majesty,
But reproved by Nathan, wept and cried bitterly,
Search now the scripture, and do what you can,
For nothing is found worse, then a covetous man.
He that delights in covetousness, has his soul to sell,
Thus says Sirach, to such as they are,
Christ by Justice must condemn such to hell,
As makes Marchandice of any such ware,
The covetous man does always both scrape and spare,
Still to satisfy, but his greedy desire,
Which at last shall bring him to unquenchable fire.
In gathering therefore of Riches, be not to bold,
For with assurance they are but as dunge,
For when many sins are waren old,
Then Covetousness will seem most young,
This my Pen utters in steed of my tunge,
The children of the covetous being stout and brave,
Daily wishes in their hearts, to se there fathers grave.
Lock not in thy breast this sinful covetousness,
Foster it not up, for any flattering fees:
Beware and be not nurce to such wickedness,
Least thou be found as a Droane among Bees,
Not esteemed in common wealth, but as rotten trees,
Worthy to be brent where ever that thou dwell,
According to Gods providence, fire brandes in Hell,
Herod the king coueted to ^lea the only Lord,
Resisting thereby his only salvation,
As too many there be that hates Gods word,
And shall therefore receive dampnation,
The second of Mathewe makes declaracion,
How Herod coueted a kingdom not permanent,
And therefore slew many a young Innocent.
Some coueteth to bie both house and land,
But hospitalitee they will none keep,
For Covetousness takes cruel things in hand,
Devouring the poor as the Wolf does the sheep,
In security of sin, they are rockt fast a sleep,
Night and day caringe for things that be vain,
But wotteth not who shall be lord of al his travel and pain
Saint Barnards Chariot they will ride in,
Wherein let them continue and dwell:
Which named is Security of vice and sin,
Leading them poast to the Devil of Hell,
For such myzers have their souls to sell,
Four wheels it has to carry on the same,
Of all which four I will show you the name.
The first wheel is called Gredie desire,
Ingratitude, and contempt of God for other twain,
And forgetfulness of Death, thereto they require,
Which four wheels do continue and remain,
To the Charet of Avarice which is led certain,
By three strong horses which runs forth the race,
Named, past shame, past repentance, and past grace.
To this Chariot, a careless Carter they must have,
Whose name is called Never content,
His whip in his hand, like a cruel slave:
With two stringes called wilful pain, and restless torment
These are ordained for everlasting punishment,
To belong to this Chariot, for their negligence,
To carry away covetous persons from good men's presence
This Chariot of Avarice with his horses so fell,
Daily is set a work to to in many a place:
But whether goes this Chariot I pray you now tell,
Some think to Satan to be resident in place,
Carried away by violence from all mercy and grace,
To follow the generation of ungodly store,
Never to have mercy nor se light any more,
Seeing covetousness does rob us of mercy and grace,
B^ing the root of all sin and wickedness,
Let us remember whilst we have space,
Calling to god to be our righteousness,
To aid and succor us, in all distress,
And now to covet his everlasting presence,
With him to reign for ever when we depart hence,
What is the cause of both sacralige and Simony,
I will now declare and manifestly express,
And show the iniciation of detestable vsery,
Now being compelled the truth to confess,
The origenall of both is very covetousness,
Likewise of Bankeroutes and Informers as I here tell,
Covetousness lately invented by Satan's counsel,
