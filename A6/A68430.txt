The virtue of ye mass.


YE folk all which have devotion
To here mass first do your besy cure
With all your inward comtemplacyon
As a myrour presentynge in figure
The moral menynge of our goostly armure
When a priest with mynysters more and less
Arayeth him by record of scripture
The same time when he shall go to mass
First se that your eyes be very contemplatyfe
And calls unto mind with hole affection
How the mass here in this present life
Of goostly gladness is thief dyreccyon
To houe a memory all of crystes passion
Our bame / our tryacle health / our medycyne
Again goostly gladness our restoracyon
As doctors remember in their doctrine
Of dyscrecyon if ye list to consider
As ye be bounte of very troth and right
You to preserve that ye do not slyder
Of all that day for lack of goostly light
First every morrow or phoebus shine bright
Let pale aurora conducte you and dress
Unto the church of christ to have a sight
For chief preseruatyfe against all goostly sykenesse
Entering the church with great humylyte
To here mass first at your vprysynge
Dyspose your self knelynge on your knee
For to be there first at his beginning
And fro the time first of his reuysshynge
Depart not till that he has do
To all your works it shall be great furtherynge
To abide the end of (In principio.
Keep you from noise and Iangelynge importune
The house of god is ordained for prayere
With sight and scelence sadly does continue
In your defaute that men no noise here
Gase not about demure of look and chere
As I said erst till the priest have do
Your good you shall increase in fere
So ye abide the end of (In principio.
In sacryfyce of ye old law
With the heed men offered up the tail
For a good beginning men should not withdraw
Till it were ended Moses gave counsel
A work begone is of more avail
If a good end acorde well thereto
And for increase of your goostly travail
Abide the end of (In principio.
Iudica me deus.
The holy man the (...) Celestyne
Like as I find written in his life
Of dyrecte devotion and grace which is dyuyne
By god inspyrate ymagynatyfe
To enpresse the power of the fendes mortal strife
Against their malice for to make resystence
Badde priests should with heart contemplatyfe
Before the awter in crystes high presence
Say first this psalm with look dyrecte to heaven
Iudica me deus) with hole heart entere
Their couscyence purge fro the sins seven
Or they presume to go to the awtere
The same psalm set in the sawtere
For a memoryall of the captyuyte
How Iherusalem stood in great danger
At Babylon that froward fell cite
This psalm complayneth as Lyre does record
Their long abiding within Babylon
Songs of their exyle might not accord
With the cantycles of Judah and Syon
Of hope dyspayred their comfort was nere gone
Like as this psalm shows in figure
But god by grace restored them euerychone
Home to Iherusalem by record of scripture
Take of this psalm the moralyte
Before rehearsed and on the other side
Be dylygent with all humylyte
On the mass following for to abide
Have this in custom and god shall the guide
All that day to govern thy passage
In what peril so ever thou go or ride
The to defend fro trouble and damage
And to give folk the more occasyon
To have this psalm in the more reverence
And here the mass with more devotion
As they be bound of troth and conscience
I am full set to do my dylygence
After my symplenesse this little psalm to translate
With humble supporte of your pacyence
Where as defaute is put the fault in lydgate.
Iudica me deus.
O thou my lord most mighty and eterne
O gracyous Ihesu of mercy and pity
Deem thou my quarrel me also dyscrene
Among mine enemies or I encombred be
My dredefull enemies that been in nombre three
The fend / the flesh / brygantes most mortal
The false world full of duplycyte
O Ihesu help or they give me a fall.
Quia tu es deus fortitudo mea.
For thou art lord only of bread and length
Of right considered I dare right well express
Thou art my supporte and my ghostly strength
Why will thou lopde suffer my symplenesse
For to proceed in sorrow and dystresse
While mine enemies proudely me assail
O blesfull Ihesu of merciful goodness
Grant of thy grace that they may not prevail.
Emitte lucem tuam.
Send down ye light lord se^de down ye ryghtwysnesse
The light of thy grace for consolacyon
Thy ryghtwysnesse my passage for to dress
By parfyte prayer by contemplacyon
To test in quyete lord send thy grace down
Me to convey that there be none obstacle
Toward the high hill of syon
Within thy holy celestyall habytacle
Et introibo ad altar.
And I shall enter lord to thyn awter
Made strong in spyryte grounded in sadness
For as me seems courage face and chere
Reioysed ben with spyrytuall gladness
My youth again renewed to his fresshenes
Which of old custom in vices was appalled
Till thyn experye gracyous goodness
Has my last end again to mercy called
Confitebitur tibi in eythara.
I shall be shryuen and confessed unto the
In thylke harp which for our awter good
Was set and wrested at caluarye on a tree
When all thy senewes were strayned on a rode
Mary and Johan under the cross stood
With weeping eyes sowned oftyme
Till the repast of our eternal fode
On eester morrow rose up before pryme
Quare tristis es anima mea.
O thou my soul how may thou heavy be
Sith christ has bought the with his passion
What cause have thou for to trouble me
Thy lord was slain for thy redempcyon
Gave he not always to thy refeccyon
On shyrethursdaye in form of wine and bread
His own blessed body in consolacyon
And on good frydaye was not he for the deed
Speraindeo
Trust in god and he right well certain
Void of dyspayre and ambyguyte
For unto him I shall be shryuen again
My goostly Joy again all aduersyte
Which of my chere is the felycyte
While he my socour is alas whom should I dread
Again all worldly perils and infernal pouste
He spared not his blood for me to blede.
Interpretatio miss.
Upon his heed an amyte first he lays
Which is a sign a token and a figure
Outward showing grounded on the faith
The largeable by record of scripture
Is right wysnes perpetual to endure
The long gyrdle clennesse and chastyte
Round on the arm the fauon does assure
All sobrenes knytte with humylyte
Thestole also stretchynge far on length
Is of doctors the aungelyke doctrine
Mowgre heretykes to stand in their strength
From crystes law never to declyne
Chesuble above with charity to shine
As bright as phoebus in his mydde spear
Holds ever his cour^e in the right line
To friend and foo stratche out his bemes clear
Parfyte priest made strong with armure
Before the awter as christ's champyon
Shall stand up right make no dyscomfyture
All our three enemies to vaynquysshe and bear down
The flesh / the world / satan the fell dragon
First to begin or we ferder pass
With contryte heart and low confession
And so to prosede devoutly to the mass.
To god above set holy his desire
So that his charity shine clear and bright
Before the gospel needs he must have fire
Torche / tapre / or else wexe candell light
Token that christ who consider a right
Is very bryghtnes of light which is eterne
To chase away the derkenesse of night
In parfyte life to guide us and govern
Officium miss.
Beginning the office by treble rehearse called
Of custom used with the repetycyon
Tokeneth the fire brennynge in the entrayled
Of old prophets by inspyracyon
Which had a faithful fervent inspeccyon
Of crystes coming by all their prophecyes
Of his birth and of his incarnacyon
For which the office is reherced thryes
Kyrie and christ in nombres thryes three
Words of greek plainly determyne
Kyrie for mercy calling to the trynyte
With goostly grace his people to enlumyne
The nombre is token orders nine
Our oraysons and prayers to present
To christ Ihesu most gracyous and benynge
Goodly accept the fine of our intent.
Gloria in excelsis.
Gloria in excelsis next in order song
Token of unity and of perfyte pease
At crystes birth herd in latin tongue
High in the air by aungelles doubtless
Present sheperdes which of the encrees
Toward bedleem holding a bright sterre
By grace enspyred they pur themself in prees
To se thylke child which stynte should our werre
This treble peace in bedleem first began
When christ was borne of grace it did fall
First peace between god and man
Between god and aungelles and also nacyons all
Ground of this peace lay in an oxes stall
Poorly lapped lord of the high empire
Let us echone unto his mercy call
Send him peace that hertely peace desire
Orationes.
For all christian devoutly for to pray
The priest at mass shall say an oryson
For living people that they may or they deye
Have repentance shryfte and comunyon
Souls in pain releas and pardon
Grace through all nacyons love and charity
Pacyence to the folks in prison
Help to all nedy that live in pouerte
Epistola.
The pystle next is figure of sonde
When christ first sent as the book makes mencyon
His dyscyples and made them take on hand
To preche his name in every regyon
Peter / Andrewe / James / Johan he sent down
Their pystles / by whom virtue began cease
All the synagoges dominacyon
And crystes faith by virtue began increase.
The pystle is a very token and figure
As sayen doctors of law and prophecye
Of crystes coming by euydent scripture
As patryarkes before did specyfye
And Johan baptyst the sone of zacharye
As a bedell told how Emanuell
Before remembered of old Isaye
How on that name should grow the gospel
And semblably so as the morrow graye
Is a messenger of phoebus vprysynge
And brings tidings of the glad day
So the pystle by prophesy of redynge
To us declares most gracyous tydynge
Of the gospel record for that party
Mathewe the euangelyst affermeth by writing
Of Ihesu christ all the genelogye
Gradale.
After the the pystell follows the grayle
Token of ascendynge up fro gre to gre
In virtue upward procadynge stondemele
The ground first at humylyte
Reyseth by grace faith hope and charity
With parfyte coming and humble pacyence
With compassyon and fraternity
In christ's passion set hole their confydence
Alleluya.
Alleluya in order next following
Tokeneth prayer for our salvation
Thryes rehearsed for our laud and praysynge
With devout heart and hole affection
Unto christ dyrecte that suffered passion
Our sovereign lord most parfyte and good
The trayte the sequence for short conclusyon
Song in his laud that for us shed his blood
Euangelium.
The gospel begins with token of Tau
The book first crossed and after the forheed
Ihesus our shield our strength in all virtue
On good friday cladde in purple reed
A crown of thorns set sharply on his heed
Four euangelystes remember it in substance
Us to defend from all wordly dread
In crystes gospel stand hole our cheuysaunce
Credo.
The gospel read a creed after he says
Solemn days for a remembrance
Of twelve artycles longing to our faith
Which we be bound to believe in creaunce
Rather to dye than any manner varyaunce
In any point were in our heart found
For faith with work to god does great pleasaunce
Let us therefore believe as we be bound
Offertorium.
By interpretacyon who wisely can aduerte
The offertory eis made of offrynge
As when a man offreth to god his herto
Rychest oblacycyon rekened by writing
And for Melchysedeche both priest and king
Gave breed and wine to Abraham for vyctory
For which oblacyon in figure remembrynge
In each day at mass is said an offertory
Token that Ihesu our savior and our lord
Again our feblenesse and our impotence
Rest on the awter called gods board
His holy blood relykes of most reverence
We to receive them with devout dylygence
In form of bread and wyme for a memory
Figure that the lamb chief of Innocence
Offered his body grounded of the offertory
Ptefatio.
Next the secret after the offertory
The preface follows before the sacrament
Aungelles rejoice with laud honor and glory
Fro heavenly court by grace they are sent
And at the mass they abide and be present
All our prayers devoutly to report
To him that sytteth above the fyrmament
Souls in pain they refresshe and comfort
Sanctus.
The old prophet holy Isaye
Saw in heaven a crown of dygnyte
Where Seraphyn song with eueri Ierarchye
Sanctus / sacntus / before the trynyte
After the preface rehearsed times three
With voice melodyous and after that osanna
With in excelsis before thy majesty
Before the sacrynge of our goostly manna.
Memento.
Of mementoos at mass there betwayne
The first remembers of folk that been alive
The second is for them that suffer pain
Which by the mass be releued by their live
Out of torment as clerks can dyscryne
Singing of masses and crystes passion
And remembrance of his wounds five
May most avail to their remyssyon
Eleuatio sacramenti.
With all your might and your best intent
Awayteth after the consecracyon
At the lyftynge up of the holy sacrament
Says Ihesu mercy with hole affection
Or else say some other parfyte orayson
As ye have in custom devoutly
Or else say this little contemplacyon
Which is written here in order by and by
Hayle Ihesu our health our goostly fode
Hayle blessed lord here in form of bread
Hayle for mankind offered on the rode
For our redempcyon with thy blood made reed
Stonge to the heart with a spear heed
Now gracyous Ihesu for thy wounds five
Grant of thy mercy before I be deed
Clean housell and shryfte while I am a live
O lamb up offered for man in sacryfyce
Nailed to the cross of merciful meekness
Whose blood down trayled in most pyteous wise
To scour the rust of all my wickedness
Of all my synnnes to the I me confess
Now lord mercy put not in delay
But grant me Ihesu of thyn high goodness
Meke shryfte and housell before mine ending day
O blessed fruit borne of a pure vyrgyn
Which with thy passion boughtest me so dear
For Maryes sake thine eeres down enclyne
Here mine orayson by mean of her prayere
The for to please teache me the manner
Void of all virtue save only of thy grace
Grant in the form lord as I se the here
The to receive I may have life and space
My lord my maker my savior and my king
When I was lost thou were my redemptour
Supporte and socour here in this living
Against all enemies my sovereign protector
My chief comfort of all worldly labor
Grant me lord confession and repentance
Or I of death pass the sharp shoure
The to receive unto my pleasaunce
Let thy mother lord be present in this need
That A may claim of mercy more than of right
Mine heritage for which thou dydest blede
And grant me Ihesu of thy might
Each day of the to have a sight
For goostly gladness in to my lives end
And in spyryte to make mine heart light
The to receive or Ihens wend
O pascall lamb in Ysaye fygured
Our spyrytuall manna breed contemplatyfe
Sent down from heaven which we be assured
Against all fone strengest confortatyfe
Tokened in paradyse upon the tree of life
Which should have restored Adam unto his place
Grant me Ihesu for a restoratyfe
The to receive or Ihens pass
Thou art in figure o blessed Ihesu
Against Satan mine heavenly champyon
My Iosue my prince of most virtue
That henge seven kings upon Gaboan
Goostly Sampson that strangled the lion
And slew the dradon with all his heedes seven
Grant or I deye christ for thy passion
I may receive this breed descended down fro heaven
As I said erst of aungelles thou art food
Repast unto pilgrims in their pilgrimage
Celestyall breed to children that been good
Fygured in Ysaac thyrty winter of aege
To caluarye when thou took thy pass
O Ihesu mercy grant or I be deed
And or decrepitus put me in dotage
To have a repast of thy celestyall breed
My goostly trust / charity / hope / and faith
Mine aduertence my mind and my memory
All of accord my soul unto the says
Have on me mercy o sovereign king of glory
Which sytteth highest in euenly cosystory
Ihesu let mercy surmount thy rygour
That thy passion alaye my purgatory
First by receyuynge of the my savior
Pater noster.
For to excyte and meue your courage
To devout prayers of hole offeccyon
The pater noster unto all manner aeges
Is most according and most sovereign of renown
Ihesus him self made this orayson
And taught his dyscyples how they should pray
Muse not thereon make no comparyson
To his doctrine all christian must obey
Short and compendyous up stretchynge to heaven
Unto the heyght celestyall mancyons
Each clause told divided in to seven
Most notable gracyous petycyons
Clerks all concluded in their reasons
Above all prayers it has the souerente
So it be said in your affeccyons
Of ghoostly love and parfyte charity
Without charity avails no alms
To cloche naked ne hongry folk to feed
Vysyte the seek nor prisoners in dystresse
Harborowed the poor nor none alms deed
If charity fails your Journey may not speed
Nor all these virtues if troth be well sought
Your pater noster nor your creed
Where charity avails little or naught
Beware ye priests when ye mass sing
That love and charity be not far absent
O goostly people before make reckoning
That your conscience and you be at one assent
Or ye receive that holy sacrament
Enuey and rancour that they be set aside
And parfyte charity be aye with you present
That grace to godwarde may be our sovereign gyde
Pater noster if it be said a right
It does exclude all imparfeccyon
So that grace hold the torche light
That charity by true affection
And fervent love have the domynacyon
From his place all hatred to remewe
That false envy have no possessyon
When this prayer is said in his order dew
Agnus.
Of agnus dei at mass be said three
The first twain besechynge for mercy
The third prays for peace and unity
Again all perils mortal and worldly
Christ as a lamb was offered on the cross
Grutched not but suffered pacyently
To make redempcyon refourme our loss
This lamb remembered in Salamons songs
Called Cantycorum most amerous of delight
In reformacyon of our contagyous wrong
Sometime was song this lamb both reed and white
Reed and rubefyed by full great despyte
His blessed body with blood so was dystrayned
The aungelyke witness could find no respyte
With blody drops his face was so be rayed
This pascall lamb on Eester day he rose
Called both a lamb and a lion
A lamb for offrynge which lay three days close
Low in the earth for our salvation
But at his mighty resurreccyon
He named was the lion of Judah
For which the church reioysynge that season
Syngeth for gladness oftymes alleluya
This Agnus det brought with him peace
To all the world at his natyuyte
Grace gladness of virtue great encreas
For which the people of love and high degree
Kiss the par a token of unity
Which kissing plainly does sygnefye
How peace is cause of all felycyte
Of lolkes governed by prudent polecye
Post common.
At the post common the priest does him remewe
On the right side says Dn^s vobiscom
Five times he does the people salewe
During the mass as made is mencyon
Figure the day of his resurreccyon
Five times sothly he did appear
To his discyples for consolacyon
And first of all to his mother dear
Salve sancta parens he to his mother said
Which was to her reioysynge sovereign
Which these words when christ Ihesu abrayd
Upon whose vpryst Mary magdalyne
With weeping eyes for constraynt of her pain
Abode the rysynge of her lord Ihesu
With other maryes the gospel tells twain
Brought oyntementes most sovereign of virtue
Poets say that love has no law
Things well expert in these ladies three
Which woke all night and rose or the day dawe
Of woman head and of femynyte
Desire love and womanly pity
Cansed them their Journey for to take
Erly in the morrow the sepulcre for to se
Of christ Ihesu all night they did wake
Let us as truly in our inward entente
As erly rise mass for to here
With such devotion as these ladies went
With parfyte charity and love as entere
To syke their lord and their spouse dear
Take ensample let us do no less
By mortal menynge follow we the manner
Erly each morrow for to here mass
After the priest says Ite missa est
He grants the people a manner of license
To depart and he toward the eest
Lift up his hands with devout reverence
Prays for all yt were in presence
To have their part of all that he has do
Taking their leave devoutly with scylence
The end abiding of In principio
Departing fro mass with peace and unity
Fygured was sometime in Exodo
When the children of Israhell fro the country
Returned again maugre king Pharao
The reed se departed was in two
A pronostyke in their pilgrimage
That crystes mass should us deliver so
From sathanas might out of all seruage
And eke as clerks in books reherce
Concludynge according all in one
How that Cyrus sometime king of Perce
To prisoners that were in Babylone
Gave license and fredome for to gone
Iherusalem again for to edyfye
Right as the fredome of us euerychone
Renewed was by coming of Messye
As in deserte children of Israhell
Fed with manna abode there forty year
We crystes people folowymge the gospel
Let by grace be of right good chere
Our ghoostly fode at meet and at soupere
Through this deserte all peril for to pass
Best refeccyon to glad all our chere
Every morrow erly to here mass
Lord of thy grace while that we be here
In this deserte of worldly wilderness
With life according our mass for to here
That peace / charity / compassyon / and clennesse
May so continue and shine in their bryghtnesse
With wholesome hand and also alms deed
To enspyre the rich to part of their richesse
With poor folk in heaven shall be their mede
Herynge of mass gives a great reward
Goostly health again all sickness
And medycyne record of saint Bernarde
To people Innocent that plain for weykenesse
To faith refresshynge in werynesse
And to folk that gone in pilgrimage
It makes them strong set them in sykenesse
Gracyously to explete their vyage
The mighty man it makes more strong
Recomforteth the seek in his langour
Gives pacyence to them that suffer wrong
The labourer it bears up in his labor
To thoughtfull people refresshynge and socour
Gracyous counseyle to folk dysconsolate
Susteyneth the feeble conuayeth the conqueror
Makes merchants their fayres fortunate
It makes men more meke to their correccyon
In ghoosty love fervent and amerous
It gives swetnesse and delectacyon
To all people that been gracyous
True obedyence and folk relygyous
Grace at departing and faith saint Johan to borowe
Defense of all enemies malycyous
To all that here mass devoutly in the morrow
Herynge of mass does passing great avail
At need at myschefe folk it does releue
Causes saint Nycholas to give good counsel
And saint Iulyan good hostell at eve
To behold saint Crystofer none enemy shall hy^ grieve
And saint Loy your Journey shall preserve
Horse ne caryage that day shall not myscheue
Mass herd before who does these saints serve
Partynge fro mass beginning your Journey
Call saint Myghell you to fortefye
For sudden haste and good prosperyte
And for good tydynge saint Gabryell shall you gye
And Raphaell by record of Thobye
Shall be your leche and your medecyne
Mass herd you hertes does apply
These obseruaunce to keep each day or ye dyne
Albon for England / saint Denyse for France
Blessed king Edmonde for royal gouernayle
Thomas of Caunterbury for his meke suffraunce
At westmynster saint Edward shall not fail
That none enemy shall hurt nor prevail
But saint George shall make you freely to pass
Hold up your baner in peace and in battle
Each day when ye devoutly here mass
Scdm Augustinum in Fasciculus morum.
Thus is the mass our spear and eke our shield
Our mighty pauyse our sword and our defense
Our mighty castle our shyltron in the field
Our strengest bolkwerke again all vyolence
For who so ever abide with reverence
To In principio the conclusyon of the mass
Grace shall gyde him and conduyte his presence
Again all his fone of high estate or less
That day a man devoutly here mass
While he is present he shall not wexe old
In going thither his steps more and less
Be or aungelles nombred and I told
His uenyall sins rekened many fold
Of neclygence and oaths that be light
They be forgyuen for grace passes gold
And all that time appears not his sight
Herynge of mass lets no vyage
As it has well be proved in certain
Prayers at mass does gretest advantage
With crystes passion to souls in their pain
The mass also does other things twain
To soul and body it does consolacyon
If he pass that day by death sudden
It stands for his housell and communyon
Of meet and drink received at the table
Mass herd before be more comfortatyfe
In double wise plainly this is no fable
To increase of virtue called vegetatyfe
By remembrance so as the tree of life
Should have preserved Adam fro sickness
So the sacrament against all goostly strife
Renews a man that day he hereth mess
So as manna was restoratyfe
To children of Israel again bodily travail
Let us well trust in our ymagynatyfe
How much the sight may help and prevail
Of the sacrament unpossyble for to fail
Us to sustain in bodily gladness
Again goostly fone more than plate or mayle
Namely that day that we devoutly here mess
Mass herd before the wind is not contrary
To maryners that day in their saylynge
And all thing that day that is necessary
God sends to prevail that day in their fedynge
Women also that gone on traueylynge
Folk expert have found thereof a prefe
That have herd mass in the morning
Were delivered and felt no myschefe
So as thyn heed has a precellence
Above all members in comparyson
So christ Ihesu of magnyfycence
Through his dyuyne dysposycyon
Set the mass for short conclusyon
As on shyrethursdaye the gospel ye may read
For a prerogatyfe about every orayson
To help all them that to him call at need
Some folk affirm in their opinion
And say that they have read it in story
A mass is egall to crystes passion
To help souls out of purgatory
Of all virtues gretest dyrectory
Which conuayeth and ledeth man by grace
Herynge of mass enprynte in thy memore
To knele or stand and change not thy place
All these things peysed in a balaunce
Let folk on the morrow erly up rise
First of entente to do god pleasaunce
In their hertes wisely aduertyse
No time is lost during that seruyse
For which let no man plainly be in doubt
But god shall dyspose in many wise
To increase all thing that they go about
Here ends the virtues of the mass.
