By the King and Queen, A PROCLAMATION For the Discovery and Apprehending of
High-way-men and Robbers, and for a Reward to the Discoverers.
William R.

WHereas Robberies upon the Highways have been frequently committed of late,
to the great Terror and Damage of Our Loving Subjects, and in Contempt of the
Laws and well Established Government of this Realm; And We being desirous to
Provide most effectually for the Common Peace and Safety of Our People, by
Suppressing and Preventing the said Mischiefs, and bringing the Offenders to
condign Punishment, Do therefore (by and with the Advice of Our Privy Council)
hereby straightly Charge and Command all Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, Mayors,
Bailiffs, Constables, Headboroughs, Tythingmen, and other Our Officers,
Ministers and Subjects to whom it does or shall appertain, That they and every
of them in their respective Places and Stations, do use their utmost Endeavors
for Discovering and Apprehending all High-way-men and Robbers: And for the
Encouragement of all such Persons to put in Execution this Our Proclamation, We
are Graciously Pleased, and do hereby Declare, That all and every Person and
Persons, who shall at any time within One year now next ensuing, Discover to
any Justice of Peace, or any other Officer of Justice, any Person that has
committed, or shall commit any Robbery on the Highway, and shall Apprehend, or
cause to be Apprehended such Offender, shall within Fifteen Days after
Conviction of such Offender so Apprehended upon such Discovery, have a Reward
of Ten pounds for every such Offender so Apprehended and Convicted: And all and
every Sheriff and Sheriffs of the respective Counties where such Conviction
shall be had, are hereby Required, upon the Certificate of the Judge, or under
the Hand of Two or more Justices before whom such Conviction shall be had, to
pay unto such Person or Persons who shall Discover and Apprehend such Offender,
or upon whose Discovery such Offenders shall be Apprehended, the said Reward of
Ten pounds, within the time aforesaid, for every Offender so Apprehended and
Convicted, out of the Public Moneys received by him in that County, which
shall be allowed unto him upon his Account in Our Exchequer; For Allowance
whereof, this Proclamation shall be a sufficient Warrant.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Eighth Day of July, 1689. In the First
Year of Our Reign. God save the King and Queen.
