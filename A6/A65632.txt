A Whigg Ballad, OR, A SUMMONS To a fresh ASSOCIATION
To the Tune of Tumble down Dick.
ON Month of September we summon you All,
Our Summons is by our Good Lord Mayor's Call,
As you Love Commonwealth, and Abhor White Hall:
Which no body can deny.
Tho Vote for P -- apillion and Weaver D -- ubois
(The Whiggs thrice-beloved, not Citizens, Choice;)
No matter what Reason, so you make a Noise;
Which no body can deny.
( Ralph B -- oy having, after a long Tory-Tugg,
Instead of a Druggist, himself proved a Drugg,
Paid Fine to a Lover of Dear Mother Mugg:) Sr Thomas Player.

Which, etc.
You All here are cited to Common Hall Vote.
Each one to lift up his True Protestant Threat,
And bawl in Defyance of Men of good Note:
Which, etc.
These are therefore to summon each Eves-dropping Citt,
Who for a State-Holder has dubbed himself fit,
And damns All that is Loyal without Fear or Wit:
Which, etc.
To Roar at Guild Hall like Homerical Mars,
In defyance oth' Head, with regard to the A -- rse R^^p.

( Guild Hall is your Stage, and Sedition your Farce.)
Which, etc.
Now after a Summons so Debonaire,
Held forth by Proprietour of the Chair,
We challenge All VVhiggs to Guild Hall to repair:
Which, etc.
For if half be True, that of late has been bruited,
The Rioting Whiglanders soon will be Routed,
As sure as Don Hornish by Bull was Cornuted:
Which, etc.
Then either born up by bold Holder forth,
You Will bravely confront your Dudley.
Deadly Foe North,
Contending like Men of True Protestant Worth:
Which, etc.
Or else, like Men-worthy, at Home you will Stay.
Solacing your Wives the Jack Pres-byter way;
If so, Good Old Cause must sing Well-a-day.
Which, etc.
