An answer to a Papisticall Byll / cast in the streets of Northampton, and
brought before the Judges at the last Syses, 1570.
The Papists bill.
HOw now my masters married Priests,
How like you of these news?
You must forsake your wicked lives,
Your wives must to the stews.
The Answer.
How now my masters popish Priests,
How like you of these news?
You must forsake your Sodomites lives,
For down is gone your stews.
2. The papisticall byll.
What need our women now take care,
What life they now do lead?
Since every preaching knave must have
A whore in house to tread.
2. The Protestant.
What need our men now to take care,
What way they go or tread,
For those Priests which were whormongers
Must now marry wife or maid.
3. The Papist.
There is not now a strumpet whore,
In all the land to have:
They are suddenly snatched up,
With some Geneua knave.
3. The Protestant.
Sith there is now no strumpet whore,
In England for to have:
Speak well then of the Gospel good,
And do no more so rave.
4. The Papist.
Master VViborne, alias tiborne ticke,
There dwells in this town:
Which sought by all the means he could,
The Easter to pluck down.
4. The Protestant.
And where that godly Preacher sought,
There dwelling in that town:
Your knauerie and hypocrisy,
At Easter to pluck down.
5. The papist.
But I of him dare well pronounce,
And time the truth shall try:
That he shall trust unto his heels,
Or else in Smithfield fry.
5. The protestant.
For this of him you dare pronounce,
And thousands of his side:
Not like to CHRIST, but to the Pope,
Who loves to see Christ fride.
6. The papist.
Not he, but thousands of his sect,
Must to Geneua seek:
The wrestling of the Gospel wrong,
Preuailes them not a leeke.
6. The Protestant.
If that in Rome and Geneua
The whoores were all well seen:
The wrestling of the Gospel pure,
By that men might well deem.
7. The Papist.
The Devil when he would Christ attempt,
In Scripture seemed wise:
And for him they the Scriptures take,
To maintain all their lies.
7. The Protestant.
CHRIST, when the devil did him tempt,
By Scripture did confute:
But Papists pass on that no less,
Then Fawkners on Hawks mute.
8. The Papist.
Therefore be packing pratyng knaves,
Your railing is to plain:
Commit your Bastards to the bag,
And hye you hence again.
8. The Protestant.
Saint Frances preaching to the Birds,
All countries has well spyde:
So as if Fools should be hanged up,
The Papists sure should ride.
9. The Papist.
And where I told you of your wives,
Take you for them no care:
Shift for your selves, and trudge with speed
Least halter be your share.
9. The Protestant.
Idolatry and adultery,
For them you take no care,
But every godly common wealth,
May wysh such tyborne fare.
10. The Papist. quod Non est Inuentus. FINIS.

10. The protestant. Coronat opus, Exitus acta probat. FINIS.

Three helps devised by the Pope for his Maiden Priests.
FIrst that Priests might examine in confessions, wives, and Maids of their
whoredom, and by that they knew to make their bargaynes, and the people
looking on, must think it confession, and committing the like with them, they
had power to give them a knauish absolucion.

2 The second help appears Glos. in Cause. 11. q 3. cap. Absit: That if any
of his Clergy should be found embrasing a woman, it must be expounded and
presupposed he does it to bless her.

3 The third help, that in every City (like as it is now in Rome) one stews
at the least to be permitted.

Experientia docet.
Doctor Weston in England, who was burnt, but not with coals, billets,
faggots, straw, nor reeds.

Also, the two Maiden Bishops at the last counsel of Trent 1562. being taken
blessing men's wives, the one was thrust through with a Bores spear, the other
hanged out of a wyndow, in the sight of all the people.

Et cetera.

Imprynted at London by John Awdely dwelling in little Britain street without
Aldersgate. 1570.
