THE TIME-SERVERS: Or, A TOUCH OF THE TIMES. Being a DIALOGUE between Tory,
Towzer, and Tantivee, At the News of the Dissolution of the Late Worthy
Parliament at Oxford


The EXPLANATION of the FIGURE.

REader, here is presented to thy View
The true Effigies of a Popish Crew:
An Irish TORY, and a Popish Priest,
And the Cur TOWZER (to make up the jest)
All on the speed for Rome; TORY o'ertakes
The Clergy, and, his Company thus bespeaks,
Spur on (Sir Priest) Spur on, The day's our own,
It that a Papist comes t'injoy the Crown:
The Parliament's dissolved, the Coast is clear,
No other Obstacles we need to fear:
Macmarra cursed be, and Harris too,
That lets the world know what it should not do,
In spite of all their tricks let us but join
Our Forces, all is ours, my life for thine.
Do you but prate and write, let me alone
To make the way for a Succession
By other means, and our Attempts shall be
Rewarded both with wealth and dignity;
Act with thy Brains, and I Will act with my Sword,
Thou shall a Bishop be, and I a Lord.
When that day comes-With that the Priest spurs on,
Bauling (at every jog) Succession:
Let things go how they will, better or worse,
The Saddle should be laid on the right Horse;
I Am for the true Successor's constant sway
Of The British Scepter, let the world say Nay:
Let Care himself, and his Fanatic Crew,
Say what they will, Princes must have their due.
Princes must have their rights, Religion
Must always pay its homage to the Crown:
It Is my belief, I know no Deity
On Earth to be adored, but Sovereignty.
The question lies not, how we are To Obey
Or Suffer, but whose right it is to Sway
The Scepter, Theyr's the right, the duty's ours,
To be obedient to the Higher Powers.
Conscience, that silly thing, that keeps in awe
The trembling Vulgar, must not check the Law;
The Laws of Empire are most sacred things,
People will have their due, and why not Kings.
The times were glorious, and the Nation flourished,
When the English Church by Mother Church was nourished.
But since 'twas weaned from her Breasts, we find
How She is wasted, languished and pined;
Revenue's gone, Promotions scarce and few,
Not half enough for the Tantivee-Crew.
The times must mend, we must reform the State,
And I will do it, or sink under my Fate:
Winged with all the haste I can, I come
To pay my Homage to the Church of Rome;
Towzer run on, and TORY clear the way,
Till I a Myter get I will not stay.
And then he hum'd himself, and spurred again
A full Tantivee speed with a loose rein,
And bended Body; Towzer trips before
(As brisk now as he was in times of Yore)
And whiles the other bawl's Succession,
This barks and yelps nothing but Forty-One.
A cunning Cur to think to drown our fears
Of future dangers with forgotten Years:
Well thus they troop together till they come
Unto the confines of desired Rome,
And here the Holy-Father ready stands
With smiling Countenance, and reared Hands
Lift up to bless them, In the one is Gold,
The other does a gorgeous Myter hold,
These (as the guerdons of their merits) he
Allures them with; And thus betrayed are we
'Twixt our known Enemies, and feigned friends,
Aiming by serving thus their own base ends,
Us into Popish Slavery to bring,
Which God in Heaven prevent- God, Save the King.
FINIS.
