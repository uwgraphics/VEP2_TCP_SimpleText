EXERCITATIONS AND MEDITATIONS Upon some Texts of Holy Scripture: And most in
Scripture Phrase and Expression.

By Samuel Thomsonn, M. A. and Doctor of Physic; formerly Student in
Magdalen-Hall in Oxford.

Tria sunt Meditationum genera: unum in creaturis; unum in Scripturis; unum in
moribus. Primum oritur ex admiratione; Secundum ex lectione; Tertium ex
circumspectione.

1. Admiratio generat quaestionem; quaestio investigationem; investigatio
inventionem.

2. Lectio ad cognoscendam veritatem materiam ministrat; Meditatio coaptat;
Oration sublevat, Operatio componit; and Contemplatio in se-ipsa exultat.

3. Circumspectio in moribus duplici consideratione discurrit; intus and foris.
Foris a^ famam; intus ad conscientiam, ut quid expediat, and quid de^^at, etc.

Contemplatio est illa species, quaerapit omnem animam desiderio sui, tanto
ardentiorem quanto mundiorem: and tanto mundiorem quanto ad spiritualia
surgentem, quanto deside^^is carnalibus and affectibus terrenis morientem.

Knight of the Shire, for the County of Somerset in this present Parliament. And
to the Right Honorable and truly Noble, the Lady MARY, His most virtuous
Consort.
Honorable and much honored,
HAving no other way to testify my gratitude of mind for those experiences of
Your Noble favors; excuse, I beseech You, my boldness in presuming to prefix
Your Names before these Exercitations of mine* which I humbly offer up unto
You, as a public testimony of my devoted Service, and deep obligations for
Your remarques of kindness toward me, and my nearest Relation; to whom, Noble
Sir, You have lately been a Munisicent Patron of undesiled hands. May the
blessings of the upper and nether springs ever Judge. ^. 15.

exemplary to others in Piety, Encouragers of Virtue; and not being ashamed of

Christianity professed and maintained, does truly ennoble: which will appear

It becomes all to seek the good of their Country; much more those who are in
high and honorable places: whose countenance is as a Command, and whose
example is, as a Rule for inferiors to walk by. Honos est onus: Honor is a
burden, and carries a burden with it.

They that are in eminency, have many eyes upon them. Their greatness cannot
hinder the vulgar from speaking of them. They are as Beacons on a hill; and as
watch-towers by the Seaside, to direct others in their course, lest they split
against rocks: for the vulgar are led much by example.

I confess this little book is compiled after a simple and plain manner. I have
not insisted in an exact Logical, or just Methodical way, but as my Meditations
did lead me; waving high strains, Rhetorical Phrases, and Philosophical
Expressions, endeavoring in plainness to condescend to the meanest capacity:
Not striving (as many do) to be admired and not understood; but to be
understood and to edify. I fear to 1 Cor. 14. 9.
be tedious.

My Prayers are, that with Psalm. 91. 16. and 128. 6.

To the Judicious READER.
I Have not used exactness of method in these my Exercitations, but have
insisted as my Meditations lead me. Neither have I garnished them with
Rhetorical flourishes, or high strains of Eloquution, but in plainness and
simplicity of the 2 Cor. 11. 3.
Gospel; to teach and affect the heart, and not to tickle the ear; or to bring
Music in stead of meat. Where I have quoted the Texts in the Originals, or
used Latin Sentences (which I studiously avoided) I have rendered them all in
English. For I had rather speak five words to edify, 1 Cor. 1. 49.
than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue. I have kept to the letter and
meaning of the Scripture: in sundry places explaining many Texts of Scripture;
and have used Scripture Phrase and Expressions, which is far best of all. I
have strived to be as brief, yet as perspicuous and clear as I might.
Diversities of studies, with various cares and troubles attending the duties of
my Profession, have hindered me from licking over, and polishing these things.
This I will promise, that as they are plain, so sound and Orthodox.

Divines have much the advantage, which are free from other avocations, may and
ought attend that very thing, giving themselves wholly thereunto; to give
attendance to Reading, to 1 Timothy 4. 13, 15.
Exhortation, and to Doctrine; to fasten nails as the Masters of Eccles. 12. 11.
Assemblies: so more is required of them.

I have adventured to do something with my Pen; first intending it for the use
of my family only; but because it may be useful for weak Christians, and
instructing to the ignorant, (for whose sake especially I set it forth) being
desirous to advance the glory of God, and do as much good as I may in my
station and generation.

Toward the building of the material Tabernacle, Goats hair Exodus 25. 4.
was commanded to be brought, and was accepted of God, as well as Gold and
Silver, and precious Stones. The meanest offerings were accepted, and the
meanest might be useful. The poor widows two mites cast into Mark 12. 42.

giver, than to the 1 Chronicles. 29. 17.
greatness or quality of the gift. If this mean offering may be accepted and
blessed of God, acceptable and profitable to those that read or hear it, I have
my desire, and shall thank God for it. None was more unwilling than my self to
come in Print: Near forty years since I compiled a Geographical and Historical
Description of the four parts of the world, yet could not be induced to Print
it. But he writes Religious books, does (as one said, Retia salutis expandere)
spread the nets of Salvation, to catch souls in: and the good works of Rev. 14.

such, will last as long as their Books live, and follow them also after death.

I cannot ( Momo satisfacere, as the Proverb is) satisfy one who will do
nothing himself, but carp and cavil at every thing another does, whether
deservedly or undeservedly. Neither care I much, for a detracting Zoilus, whom
I answer with the Poet,

Pexatus pulchre, rides mea Zoile trita:
Sunt haec trita quidem Zoile: sed mea sunt.
Leaving these following Exercitations and Meditations, to your most serious
Meditation: and your Meditations to Gods especial blessing, and setting it home
upon your hearts by His Holy Spirit: that God in all things may be glorified,
and the salvation of Souls furthered, against that great and notable day of the
Lord Jesus; to whom I commend you, and remain

Your Friend and Servant, Sam. Thomsonn.

EXERCITATION THE FIRST.
Ezekiel. 16. 8. I entered into a Covenant with thee, says the Lord God; and thou
becamest mine.
GOd in this Chapter, by Ezekiel a Priest and a Prophet, declares His great
mercies to the people of Israel, and their horrid and vile ingratitude. Among
all His mercies, this was none of the least, that God entered into a Covenant
with them.

There are three things among men that do induce a public obligation, and yet
do differ in themselves; As, 1. a Law. 2. A Covenant. 3. A Testament.

A Law and a Testament are absolute, and do not imply any consent of the party
under them. For a Law requires subjection, not expecting the consent of
inferiors: So a Testament, or a Will of a Man, is to bequeath such Goods and
Legacies, not expecting the consent of others. But a Covenant requires consent
and agreement between two parties.

The Covenant of God with man is twofold: 1. That of Works, which was made
before the fall, with Adam in his innocence. 2. The Covenant of Grace, which
was made since the fall.

The Covenant of Works with Adam before the fall, is laid down more obscurely,
than the Covenant of Grace was Genesis 2. 16, 17.
after the fall. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, of every tree of
the garden thou may freely eat; but of the tree of Knowledge of good and
evil, thou shall not eat of it: for in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shall
surely dye.

Do this and thou shall live ^ if thou do it not thou shall dye. And so God
enabled Adam to do that which was good; for the which, he was the more obliged
unto God. Or thus, The Covenant of Works God made with Adam, promising him
therein an everlasting continuance of felicity and happiness, under condition
of his obedience unto God; but threatening death to him, if he were disobedient.

This Covenant of Works was confirmed by a double Sacrament: 1. The tree of
life. 2. The tree of knowledge of good and evil; both seated in the midst of
Paradise. The use of these was double.

1. That by the use of the one, and by abstaining from the other, man's
obedience might be tried.

2. That the tree of life might Seal to man being obedient, his perpetuity of
happiness; and that the tree of knowledge of good and evil, might signify unto
man, if he were disobedient, the loss of the greatest good, and the purchasing
and procuring of the greatest evil.

The tree of life was not so called, from any inward implanted faculty of
quickening in it; but a Sacramental signification. So also the tree of knowledge
of good and evil, had this name from the signification of the greatest evil or
good, with the event and consequences thereof.

Here in this Covenant needed no Mediator, for it was before sin was in the
world: and Adam then was in perfect familiarity and communion with God.

It was Sin that brought in enmity, fear, and shame; as well as punishment and
death. For presently after the fall, Adam hid himself from the presence of the
Lord, and feared, etc. because of the guilt of Sin, and breach of Gods
Commandment. So he confessed, I was afraid Genesis 3. 10.
because I was naked, and hid my self. These are the grounds and reasons to
prove that God dealt with Adam in these Commandments, by way of Covenant.

1. From the evil threatened, and good promised.

2. Because his posterity became guilty of his Sin, and obnoxious and liable to
his punishment.

3. Because the Apostle Paul in Romans 5. 12, 15, 18. makes all men in Adam, as
believers are in Christ, which is by a foenant, or Covenant agreement.

Q. How can God be said to Covenant, or enter into promise with man?

A. It is of Gods great condescension so to do, in regard of His Sovereignty
over man. And yet to give, and to promise to give, are acts of His dominion and
liberality; and so no ways repugnant to the great and glorious Majesty of God:
But it is to confirm us in our hope and confidence in Him, and in our obedience
unto Him.

Q. Why does God deal with man in a Covenant way, rather than in a mere supreme
and absolute way?

A. 1. To sweeten and endear Himself unto us: So that Adam could not but have
thankful and loving thoughts of God, that would thus far condescend unto him.

2. To incite and encourage Adam the more to obedience, and that to a willing
and free obedience.

When our first Parents had broken this Covenant and were fallen; God out of
His infinite pity, mercy, and compassion to mankind, made with them another
Covenant, a Covenant of Grace. And because man was an ill-keeper; when he had
his salvation in his own hands, he soon by Sin lost it, and himself thereby.

Therefore our gracious God would not have our Salvation any longer in our own
keeping; but made this His Covenant with man, in the hands of a Mediator, even
the Lord Jesus Christ; who Mal. 3. 1.
is therefore called the Angel of the Covenant; who will be sure to preserve
and keep us, by the mighty power of God, through faith unto salvation. 1 Pet.
1. 5.


And herein Gods unspeakable mercy to manking appeared, not by works of
righteousness which we have done, but ^itus 3. 4, 5, 6, 7.
according to His mercy He has saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and
renewing of the Holy Ghost, which He has shed on us abundantly, through Jesus
Christ our Savior: that being justified by His Grace, we should be made heirs
according to the hope of eternal life.

Yea, before God pronounced the Curse or Sentence of Judgment after Adam's
fall, He graciously showed a way, and a surer way of salvation in and through
Christ the Mediator: when He said, the seed of the woman shall break the
Serpents head.

As this Covenant was first Preached by God to Adam; the Lord showed him his
Sin, and the curse due for Sin; and then sets an enmity between him and the
serpent: they must fight it out, whereof the issue will be thus; A certain seed
of the woman shall utterly overthrow Satan, even breaking the head of that
Serpent; but the Serpent shall only bruise His heel; which signified light and
temporary afflictions, both in the Head, and also in the members of Christ the
head.

By virtue of which promise, the Church continued until Abraham's time, and
then the Covenant is renewed: In Genesis 22. 18.
thy seed shall all the Nations of the earth be blessed.

The condition required of Abraham, was to believe; so Abraham believed in Genesis
15. 6.
God, and He counted it to him for righteousness. Not that this was Abraham's
righteousness before God; but that habit, that grace of faith (chiefly looking
to the Messiah promised) that believing disposition, whereby he was able to
believe that promise, this was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness; Romans 4.
2, 3.
which brings us to speak of the Covenant of Grace.

The Covenant of Grace, is a mutual agreement between God and men: whereby God
confirms unto men, that He will be favorable unto them, forgiving them their
Sins, and giving unto them new righteousness, His Holy Spirit, and everlasting
life, by and through His Son our Mediator. And men oblige themselves unto God,
to receive so great benefits by lively faith, and to yield to God all true
obedience.

This mutual agreement between God and man, is confirmed by outward signs and
seals, which we call Sacraments.

Sacraments are holy signs testifying God's good will toward us, and our
gratitude and duty toward God.

This Covenant could not be made without a Mediator; for we could never make
satisfaction, nor return into favor with God by and of our selves: Neither
could God admit us for His justice sake, without sufficient satisfaction; which
we could never make: For we were enemies to God, and so there was no way open
for us to come unto God, but by that new and living way, namely the blood of
Christ. So then this Reconciliation Heb. 10. 20.
could never be made, but by the satisfaction and death of the Mediator.

That on which all the promises now initially hang* is nothing but believing.
Who so now believes in God, shall be put within the Covenant. And there are
these four reasons why all depends upon faith.

First, Because true faith is never alone, but draws with it all other Graces:
he that believes in God, has a good opinion of God, and loves God; and he that
loves God must needs be full of good works. Jam. 2. 17, 18.


Secondly, Only faith makes the promises sure unto us; otherwise Christ and the
Covenant of Grace had been spared.

Thirdly, The Covenant consists of promises: nothing but faith can answer this
Covenant, which is not a Commandment, but a Promise. Commandments are answered
by obedience, but Promises are answered by faith.

Fourthly, It is by faith; because God would have it go by free Grace, and not
of debt: God deals with us as with Sons, and not as with Servants; He pays
Romans 3. 27. Romans 11.
us not wages, but gives us an inheritance. So all boasting is excluded.

The sum of the Covenant of Grace is this, That God will be our God, and give
us everlasting life in Christ Jesus, if we receive Him by faith, being freely
Joh. 1. 12. Jer. 31. 33. Acts 16. 30, 31:
by His Father offered unto us: where hence will follow new obedience, whereby
the faithful walk worthy of the Grace received; and this is also by the Grace
of God.

This God's eternal love and free Grace toward us, is the highest link of our
salvation, both in order of time, nature, and causality. Whom He predestined,
Romans 8. 29, 30.
those also He called; and whom He called, those He justified; and whom He
justified, those also He glorified.

God loved us when we were Sinners, enemies to Him, and that by wicked works.
If our wicked works could not Col. 1. 21.
prevent the love of God to us, why should we think they can nullify or destroy
it? if the mass, guilt, and greatness of Adam's Sin (in which all men were
equally sharers) could not interrupt or frustrate God's counsel of loving us
when we were His enemies; why should any other Sins over-turn the stability of
the same love and counsel, when we are become His Sons, and have a Spirit given
us to bewail and lament our Sins?

It was God's promise flowing from this everlasting love that caused Him to
make an everlasting Covenant with us, that He would not turn away from us to do
us good.

But though God turn not away from us, oh how apt are we to turn away from Him!
Nay, says the Lord, I will Jer. 32. 40.
put my fear in their hearts, and they shall not depart from me. God inclines
our hearts to do those things which He commands; and so by over-powring our
stubborn and perverse wills, He makes us to be a willing people in the day of
His power. Psalm. 110. 3.


First, This Covenant of Grace is one in substance: for there is one God, one
Mediator between God and men, even Christ Jesus, one manner of reconciliation,
Acts 4. 12. Joh. 14. 6* and 8. 56.
one faith, one way of salvation; and that for all those that are saved since
the beginning of the world, or shall be saved to the end of it. So the Covenant
of Grace is one, according to the principal conditions; whereby,

1. God obliges Himself to us, promising remission of Sins to all those who
repent and believe; and we do bind our selves to believe in God, and act
repentance.

2. But according to the less principal conditions, or (as others say) the
manner of administration; so they are two Covenants, the Old, and the New; the
first and the second.

Q. Wherein do the two Covenants agree, viz. this old and new?

A. 1. They agree in the author, God; and in the Mediator, Christ.

2. In the promise of Grace; which is, of pardon of Sin, and life everlasting,
freely given to those that believe by and through Christ: which promise of
Grace was common to the Saints of old, as well as unto us; although now it is
more clear, and more often repeated.

3. In the condition in respect of us. In both, God required faith and
obedience. So to Abraham, Walk before Genesis 17. 1. Mark. 1. 15.
me, and be upright: And to us, Repent and believe the Gospel. So the new
Covenant agrees with the old, according to the principal conditions, both in
respect of God, and also of us.

Q. Wherein the new Covenant and the old do differ?

A. 1. In corporal promises: as the Land of Canaan promised to the Jews; their
form of ceremonial Worship, and their outward political Government until Christ
came: Christ to be of their seed: and many other suchlike. But the new
Covenant has not such special corporal promises; but only in general, that God
will preserve His Church to the end of the world, etc.

2. In the circumstances of the promise of Grace: In the old Covenant they were
received into Grace and favor, upon believing in Christ that was to come: In
the new Covenant, we are received into Grace and favor, by believing in Christ
that is already come.

3. In the rights and signs added to the promise of Grace; for in the old
Covenant there were other Sacraments various, chargeable, painful; as
Circumcision, the Passover, Oblations, Sacrifices. But in the new Covenant,
there are fewer Sacraments, and they more simple, as Baptism, and the Supper of
the Lord.

4. In the clearness; in the old Covenant all were typical, and under shaddows,
as their Priests, Sacrifices, etc. so all things were obscure. But in the New
Covenant, all things are clearer, both in Doctrine and in Sacraments; we having
the fulfilling of the types.

5. The old Covenant and the new do differ in gifts: heretofore it was more
narrow and sparing: now a more large Jer. 31. 31* 2 Cor. 3. 9. Joel. 2. 28.
and plentiful effusion of the Graces of the Spirit. I will make a new Covenant
with them, says the Lord; I will write My Law in their hearts; and I will be
their God, and they shall be My people, etc. I will pour out My Spirit upon all
flesh, etc.

6. In the time: the old Covenant was but temporary, until the coming of the
Messiah: The new Covenant is eternal: I will make an everlasting Covenant Jer.
32. 40*
with them.

7. In obliging: the old Covenant obliged the people to all the Law, both both
Moral, Ceremonial, and Judicial. The new Covenant obliges us only to the Moral
Law, and to the use o^ the Sacraments of Christ.

8. In the amplitude and largeness* in the old Covenant, the Church was
included within the Jewish Nation; to which, all others that would be saved
must join themselves, thence was that saying, Salvation is of the Jews. But in
Joh. 4. 22.
the new Covenant; the Church is sca^tered over all Nations; and access is open
to it, unto all believers, Of every nation, he that fears God, and works
Acts 10. 35.
righteousness is accepted of Him.

1. Then take we heed of refusing this acceptable time, and this day of
Salvation. Now the door is open, let us come in thereat: and join our selves to
the Lord, to be His Covenant-Servants, and that for ever: taking the Lord to be
our God; to love, serve, and fear Him, and to keep his Commandments.

2. The cause why God enters into Covenant with us, is as because He loves Heb.
6. 18*
us, so to give us strong consolation, that He will do us good, and make us for
to know it. Labor we therefore for more knowledge of God in Christ; to
understand the unsearchable riches of Christ, Ephesians. 3. 8, 19.
and to be filled with all the fullness of God. For there may be knowledge
without Grace; but there can be no Grace without knowledge.

Then may we comfort our selves in applying the promises of the Covenant to our
selves; as to instance in these three promises only; As,

1: Of Justification; when Sin lies heavy on thy Conscience, lay claim to the
Covenant, wherein God has said, Their sins and iniquities I will remember no
more.

2. Of Sanctification; if a lust be too strong for thee, and thou would fain
be rid of it; go to God and beseech Him to make good His Covenant in this
respect, to deliver thee from all thine enemies, to write His Law in thy heart,
to give thee a new heart; to pour clean Ezekiel. 36. 25, 26.
water upon thee, (even the sanctifying Graces of His holy Spirit) and from all
thy filthinesses to cleanse thee. And then (as He said to St. Paul) His Grace 2
Cor. 12. 6.
shall be sufficient for thee.

3. Of outward blessings and deliverances; in every straight, want, danger,
disease, or the like; plead hard with God, tell Him of His Covenant, pray Him
to be thy buckler, and to deliver thee, to supply all thy need, and to be a
present help unto thee in thy needful time of trouble, etc.

The promises are full of consolation* but thou must suck hard at these breasts
of consolation, and draw them out* Isai. 66. 11.
And so make use of the promises to the utmost.

Thus Jacob stayed himself upon the promise, when he was in great extremity,
and in very much fear of his rough brother Esau; he urged God with his promise,
Lord thou have said, Thou Genesis 32. 12. and 28. 13, 15.
wilt surely do me good; deliver me I pray thee, etc. So do thou as Jacob there
did, wrestle with God in Prayer, and give Him not over until He bless thee.

So David prays to God, to have respect Psalm. 74. 10.
to the Covenant.

Jeremiah likewise prays, Do not Jer. 14. 21.
abhor us for Thy Names sake; Oh remember, break not Thy Covenant with us.

So look to the Covenant and the Promises, build upon them, hold them fast, and
be assured that in God's good time, (though perhaps not in thy desired time)
all shall be fulfilled. And God will either give thee the mercy desired, or
that which is better for thee.

Now let us consider the misery of all those who are not in Covenant with God.
They are without God in the world, Ephesians. 2. 12.
and have no hope; they have no right to one of the promises; wicked creatures,
subject to many wants, and need much assistance from God, and yet can have no
confidence to go unto God.

Oh that pitiful speech of Saul! I am 1 Samuel 28. 1^.
sore distressed, for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed
from me, and answers me no more, etc.

Yea, as they have no comfort from God, so God is their enemy, a devouring fire
unto them, everlasting burnings, quickly and easily consuming them as stubble;
yea, and all the creatures are at enmity with them, because they are at enmity
with God. All Men, Beasts, and Devils may hurt them, there is no prohibition
against them; for wicked men have no interest in God by Covenant, and so are
out of His more especial profection. God oftentimes lets loose the creatures
against them, go, and worry them, wound them, hurt them, be an enemy unto them,
destroy them.

Afflictions to those that are not in Covenant with God, are as a cup of
poison, and as a sword for their destruction. The bread and meat which they
eat, may choke them: Though they have a civil right before men, yet they are
usurpers before God, of all their Lands and Estates, and of all the good things
of the world which they have and do enjoy.

On the other side, I might largely speak of the comforts, blessedness,
security, and happiness of all those who have a Covenant Interest in God, and
who can truly say to the Lord, O Lord, thou art my God. Read Job. 25. 23. to
the end. As God is faithful in keeping Covenant with us, let us be faithful in
keeping Covenant with God.

In Covenants between men, there is usually a league offensive and defensive,
to defend and help each other. Let God's enemies be our enemies; as David said,
Do not I hate them, O Lord, that Psalm. 139. 21.
hate thee? and am not I grieved at those that rise up against thee? I hate
them with perfect hatred: I account them mine enemies. Let no iniquity cleave
unto us, neither allow we our selves in any one known Sin. Grieve when God's
Name is dishonored, His Laws broken, His Sabbath profaned, etc. Let every
thing that bears the Stamp or Name of God be precious to us, as His Ordinances,
Sabbaths, Servants, etc. Stand up in Gods Number. 25. 7.
cause, like Phinehas, and shrink not back. Side not with any ungodly speeches,
courses, or practices. As God is not ashamed Heb. 11. 6.
to make us His people, and to be called our God; so let not us be afraid or
ashamed to make it good upon all occasions. Else if we be ashamed of Christ and
His words here, of us will He be ashamed when He comes in the glory of His
Father Mark 8. 38.
with His holy Angels. Especially let us take heed we be not a shame to Christ,
and our Christian profession by ungodly or unsuitable lives. We have great
cause of admiration, that the great and glorious and most holy God, would enter
into Covenant with us such vile miserable and sinful creatures; and so to
oblige Himself unto us to do us good.

As God is ours, so all that is in God is ours, and for our good. He provides
Isai. 54. 13. and 48. 17.
for us for Soul and Body. He does instruct and teach us, we are all taught of
God, who alone teaches to profit. He helps us to grow in Grace, and to hold out
against all oppositions. He comforts us with the consolations of God, which are
very sweet and precious. He 2 Cor. 1. 4.
encourages us in His ways, preserves us therein against all the temptations
and power of Devils or wicked men. He is Josh. 23. 6. Psa. 84. ^1.
a sun and shield to us, to direct and protect us: He gives us grace and glory,
no good thing will He withold from us. None shall ever pluck us out of His
Joh. 10. 28.
hands. He will guide us with His counsel here, and at length will bring us
safe Psalm. 73. 24.
to His glory: That where our blessed Savior is, there we may also be, and
Joh. 17. 24.
that for ever. We have also a right to the creatures, and to all God's
promises, and to Heaven. God has confirmed and ratified His Covenant with us.

1. By his promise, which is a sure word. Therefore it is of faith, that it
might be of Grace, to the end the promise Romans 4. 16. 2 Pet. 1. 19.
might be sure, etc.

2. By His oath: God willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of promise,
the immutability of His counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two immutable
things (that is, His Word, and His Oath) in which it was impossible Heb. 6. 17,
18.
for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, etc.

3. By the death of His Son, the blood of Christ. For where a Testament is,
there must also of necessity be the death Heb. 9. 16.
of the Testator.

By the seals of the Sacraments; which is not so much, to confirm the promises
on God's part; but to help our faith to believe them, and to rely upon them.

Q. How may we know if we are in Covenant with God?

A. 1. By faith: Abraham believed God, and was reckoned to be in Covenant with
God; and so he was called Romans 4. 3.
the friend of God. But this must be a true lively working faith; a faith that
shows it self by its good works. This Acts 15. 9.
faith purifies the heart.

2. If we be in Christ, and have His Spirit, for if any have not the Spirit of
Christ, he is none of His. This holy Spirit makes us like unto God, and so
testifies with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God: and also that we
are partakers of the Covenant. After that we believe in Christ, we are sealed
with Ephesians. ^. 13, 14.
that holy Spirit of promise; which is the earnest of our inheritance, etc.
This is a Divine impression of light, and an inexpressible Rev. 2. 17. Joh. 14.
21.
assurance, that we are the children of God, and so in Covenant with Him. None
knows it, but he that has it. It is better felt, than expressed.

3. We may know if we be in Covenant with God, by our own knowledge. After God
had rehearsed the Covenant Jer. 31. 34.
there, He adds* And they shall all know Me* from the least to the greatest,
etc.

True knowledge of God in Christ, first makes us to put off the old man with his
deeds, and to be renewed in the Spirit of our mind, and to put on the Newman,
Ephesians. 4. 22, 23, 24.
which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness; and which is
renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created Him. And 2. It works
in us a readiness and Col. 3. 10.
willingness to obey God, and to serve Him: when we are brought out of the
slavery of Satan, and from the bondage of sin and corruption, that sin does not
reign over us; then will we run the Romans 6. 12.
ways of God's Commandments, and that with alacrity and cheerfulness, not
thinking it a burden; run and not be Psalm. 119. 32. Isai. 40. 31.
weary* walk and not faint. They who are thus in Covenant with God, have a
special interest in Him, and have access with boldness to the throne of Grace
(through our great High Priest Jesus the Son of God) that they may obtain
mercy, and find Grace to help in time Heb. 4. 14, 16.
of need.

Therefore Abraham after God had so entered into Covenant with him, refused the
King of sodom and his gifts, wholly relying on God's Covenant for His blessing;
and said, I have lifted up my hand Genesis 14. 22, 23.
unto the Lord the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth; that I
will not take from a thread, even to a shoolatchet, and that I will take any
thing that is the King of Sodoms; lest thou should say, I have made Abraham
rich.

This also upheld David, when he had 1 Samuel 30. 6.
lost wives and children, and goods, the City burnt, all lost, and the people
spoke of stoning him; then he encouraged himself in the Lord HIS God.

He glories in his Covenant Interest with God, that God yet had made an
everlasting Covenant with him, ordered in all things and sure: For this (said
he) 2 Samuel 23. 5.
is all my salvation, and all my desire, etc.

God says to His Vovenant People, The mountains shall depart, and the hills
Isai. 54. 10.
be removed, but My kindness shall not depart from thee, neither the Cavenant
of My peace be removed, says the Lord that has mercy on thee. Read all the
Chapter; For the Lord has avouched thee, to Deuteronomy. 26. 16, 17, 18.
be His peculiar servant, that thou may be holy to the Lord thy God: and thou
have avouched the Lord to be thy God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His
Statutes, Numb. 14. 24.
and His Commandments, and His Judgments, and to hearken to His voice. And thou
have chosen thee the Lord to Josh. 24. 22.
serve Him. O my soul, thou have said to the Lord, thou art My Lord: thou have
chosen, and appropriated the Lord Jehovah, Psalm. 16. 2. and 140. 6.
to be thy Lord.

Let not therefore other Lords have ^sa^. 26. 13.
dominion over thee; as Satan, sin, thy foolish noysom lusts, the profits or
pleasures or vanities of this world, ever bewitch thee or steal away thy heart
from following this thy Lord, and that fully. As thou have yielded thy members
servants Numb* 14. 24:
to uncleanness, and to iniquity unto Romans 6. 19.
iniquity: Even so now yield thy members servants to righteousness, unto
holiness.

Let holiness to the Lord be written Zec^. 14. 20.
on thy heart and forehead, on all the inward faculties of thy Soul, and on all
the members of thy body, and on all thy whole conversation and commerce with
men. That all may take notice of Acts 4. 13.
thee, that thou have been with Jesus: that thou walk the way to Zion with
thy face thitherward; and that thou have joined thy self to the Lord in a
perpetual Jer. 50. 5.
Covenant which shall not be forgotten: that thy light may so shine before men,
that seeing thy good works, they may glorify thy Father which is Matt. 5. 16.
in Heaven.

That thou may declare plainly, that thou do seek a country; and Heb. 11.
14, 16.
that thou desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: that God may not
be ashamed to be called thy God; for He has prepared for thee a City: Even a
City wherein is no Temple.

For in the Temple were the outward signs of God's presence; but God in this
heavenly City shall manifest Himself face to face to His elect in Christ.

And this City has no need of the Sun, Rev. 21. 22, 23.
neither of the Moon to shine in it; for the glory of God does lighten it, and
the Lamb is the light thereof.

In that heavenly glory my husband Jesus Christ shall be the only means of of
all the communication, that I and all the Elect shall have in the glory and
light of God; in whose presence is fullness Psalm. 16. 11.
of joy, and at Whose right hand there are pleasures for evermore.

This God is my God (and in Covenant Isai. 25. 1.
with me) I will praise Him; and bless His Name for ever and ever.

As the Lord has entered into Covenant with me, and married me unto Himself; so
He gives me always to be arrayed in sine linen, clean and white, (which Rev.
19. 8.
sine linen is the righteousness of the Saints): that I may watch and keep my
garments, lest I walk naked and men see Rev. 16. 15.
my shame: That I hating even the garment Jude 23. Rev. 3. 4.
spotted by the flesh; may walk with God in white, and may be esteemed worthy,
through the worthiness and righteousness of Christ imputed unto me: In whom
alone I desire to be found, not Phil. 3. 9.
having on mine own righteousness, (which is as menstruous rags) but that Isai.
30. 22.
which is of God by faith.

I can never sufficiently magnify and admire the eternal love of God to me in
Christ; that He has chosen me in Him, before the foundation of the world, that
I should be holy and unblameable before Him in love: having predestined me
Ephesians. 1. 4, 5.
unto the adoption of a Child by Jesus Christ unto Himself, according to the
good pleasure of His will: and has entered into Covenant with me, and so Ezekiel.
16. 8.
has made me to become His own. And that not for any foreseen faith or works
in me, but according to the election of Grace. He loved me, because he loved
Romans 11. 5.
me; and He had compassion upon me, because He had compassion upon me. Oh Romans
9. 15.
the good Will of Him that dwelt in the Deuteronomy. 33. 16.
Bush!

There is a mutual promise and obligation between God and me, and all other
true believers, that God for ever will be the God of His people, and of their
posterity also (if they walk in God's ways, and make not void His Covenant).
And they again promise and oblige themselves to God, to be His people, to keep
His Covenant, by believing in Him, and obeying His Commandments.

Let all those that truly endeavor to keep Covenant with God, beware of
Covenant Breaking; if they fail that way, be duly humbled for it; and be more
watchful and wary for the future; striving to recover themselves by serious and
renewed repentance.

Let them set God always before their Psalm. 16. 8.
eyes, endeavoring to walk before Him Genesis 17. 1.
and to be perfect. The meaning is, let them bear God always in their mind, as
present with them, rest themselves by faith on Him alone, depend upon His
Providence, and regulate all their actions according to His Will revealed in
His Word. God has made His Covenant between Him and all such, and God declares
it is so, and enlarges on it; saying to Abraham, I will establish My Verse 2.
4. 7.
Covenant between Me and thee, and thy seed after thee; to be a God unto thee,
and to thy seed after thee. These words ( to be a God to thee) signify as if
God had said, By virtue of my Covenant, I will communicate to thee and thy
seed, the effects of all the perfections of My nature; and all that I am in My
Self, I will be on their behalf: and as I do live eternally, so will I cause
all mine to live likewise.

And so in reference to our part of the Covenant, it is as much as if God had
said, I will be He alone whom thou shall serve, acknowledge and worship as God,
and upon whom alone thou shall absolutely depend, forsaking all others.

For so the words of the Covenant are, I will put My Law in their inward Jer.
31. 33, 34.
parts, and write it in their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall
be My people: and they shall all know Me, from the least even to the greatest
of them, says the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquities, and remember
their sins no more.

And in Ezekiel it is laid down thus, Ezekiel. 36. 25, 26, 27.
I will sprinkle clean water upon you, (even the sanctifying Graces of My
Spirit) and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your
Idols will I cleanse you. A new-heart also will I give you, and a new-spirit
will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh,
and will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and
cause you to walk in My statutes, and ye shall keep My judgments, and do them.

They that are thus brought into the Ezekiel. 20. 37.
bond of the Covenant may say, and so said the Apostle Paul, I am persuaded,
Romans 8. 38, 39
that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor
things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
creature, shall ever be able to separate us from the love of God which is in
Christ Jesus our Lord.

I entered into Covenant with thee, says the Lord God, it is in the Hebrew,
the Lord Jehovah. Wherever in Scripture in the Old Testament, the Word Lord
or God is written in great or Capital Letters, it is in the Hebrew, Jehovah.

Jehovah sets out God's eternity, in that it contains all times, to come, or
present or past. The 3 syllables in the word Jehovah, contain the notes of all
times.

The first syllable Je, denotes the time to come. The second Ho, the time
present. The third Vah, the time past. God has His being, and is from Himself.
He always is, always lives, and always is the same. For He is unchangeable.
Mal. 3. 6.
So none can say, IAM, but Exodus 3. 14.
God alone.

Thus the title given to Christ, which Rev. 1* 4, 8.
is, and which was, and which is to come, is an express interpretation of
Jehovah.

It sets out also God's Self-existency, coming from the Verb that signifies to
be. God gives a being to Himself, to His Creatures, and to His Promises.

Whenever in Scripture, some special Levit. 19. 12, 14, 16, 18, 25, 30, 34, 37.
Mercy is promised, or some extraordinary Judgment threatened, the Name of
Jehovah is affixed or added, I am Jehovah. To show that God is just and
faithful in the performance both of His promises and threatenings.

This Name Jehovah, (as the Hebrews well note) consists of Letters quiescent,
or Letters of rest: to show that there is no rest, till we come to Jehovah, and
that in Him we may safely rest. There the wicked cease Job. 3. 17.
from troubling, and there the weary be at rest.

The Septuagint in the Greek Translation, do almost everywhere render the Name
Jehovah (...) Lord: for He that is Jehovah, namely whose essence and being is
from Himself, who gives to all their beings, and preserves and upholdeth them
therein, He is most absolutely and properly Lord.

Jehovah sometimes is used essentially, for the three Persons in the blessed
Trinity jointly, as Exodus 20* 2, 5, 7.

Sometimes personally, for the Father* Jehovah said to my Lord, sit thou on my
Psalm. 110. 1.
right hand, etc. that is, God the Father to God the Son.

Sometime Jehovah is used personally for the Son; as Jehovah rained from Genesis
19. 24.
Jehovah fire and brimstone upon Sodom and Gomorrah out of Heaven: that is, God
the Father, from God the Son. For the Father has committed all judgment Joh.
5. 22.
to the Son.

And sometimes the Name Jehovah is given to the Holy Ghost, as it is understood
and gathered out of Numb. 12. 6. God in the Hebrew tongue in the Old Testament,
has been pleased to name and manifest Himself by ten Names: whereof three are
from His being, (or ab esse) as Jehovah, Jah, Ehejeh. Sum, Ero; from His
eternal Essence.

Three more from His Almighty Power, (or a posse) as El, Eloheh, Elohim.

And three from His being over all; (or a prae-esse) as Adonai, Shaddai,
Jehovah Tzebaoth, or Deus exercituum, the Lord of Hosts.

And the last Name of God is from His eminency (or ab eminere) Gnel jon, which
signifies God above all, or Lord over all. This last Name of God is used in
Psalm. 73. 11. Is there knowledge in the most High? And in Genes. 14. 10. 20.
Blessed be Abraham of the most High God, the possessor of Heaven and Earth: And
blessed be the most High God, etc. He alone is King of Kings, and Lord Rev. 19.
16.
of Lords.

By His Name Jehovah has He been Exodus 6. 3. Isai. 26. 4.
made known to us: Therefore trust we in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord
Jehovah is everlasting strength.

As all things were made by Him and for Him; so all things are upheld and
preserved by Him. He upholds all things by the word of his power. And they
cannot Heb. 1. 3.

mankind. He gives a being to all His Job. 12. 10.

yea, and in Him, Amen. All the creatures out of this inexhausted fountain,

to think any thing as of our selves; but all our sufficiency is of God. Romans

Of Him, through Him, and by Him are all things; therefore to Him be glory for
ever; Amen.

And now, what does the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord

EXERCITATION THE SECOND.
Of Sacraments in general, which are the Seals of the Covenant.
Q. What is a Sacrament?

A. A Sacrament is an Ordinance of God, wherein by giving and receiving of
outward Elements according to His Will, the promises of the Covenant of Grace
made in the blood of Christ, being represented, exhibited, and applied unto us,
are farther signed and sealed betwixt God and Man.

Sacraments are seals annexed to the Romans 4. 11.
Covenant of Grace to instruct, assure, 1 Cor. 11. 23.
and possess us of our part in Christ and His benefits, and to bind us to all
thankful Gal. 3. 27.
obedience to God in Him; that we Romans 6. 4.
should walk in newness of life. God alone is the Author of a Sacrament,
because He alone can bestow those Graces which are sealed therein.

There be two only Sacraments in the New Testament.

1. Baptism. 2. The Supper of the Lord.

Baptism is a Sacrament of our entrance into the Covenant of Grace: the Lords
Supper is a Sacrament of our continuance therein.

The other five Sacraments of the Papists, as Matrimony, Orders, Extreme
Unction, Penance, and Confirmation, do want an outward sign and institution by
Christ, and so be no seals of saving Grace. I could severally and distinctly
prove those five to be no Sacraments, but then I should be too prolix.

The word Sacrament is not used in all the New Testament, it is here taken for
a Divine Mysteric propounded and represented by outward signs and figures, or
symbols. This signification in the word Sacrament is fitly answered, and is
borrowed by the Latin Ecclesiastical Writers, from Military businesses; in
which, the Oath that Soldiers took, and were obliged by to their General, was
called a Sacrament. This may aptly and sitly be so used here; for in our
Baptism by our Sureties (until we come of age to perform it our selves) we
oblige and bind our selves by a solemn vow, to our great Captain and General
the Lord Jesus Christ, to fight under His banner, against Sin, the World, and
the Devil, and to continue His faithful Soldiers and Servants to our lives end.

These were the words used by every Roman Soldier in his Oath, Obtemperaturus
sum, and facturus, quioquid mandabitur ab imperatoribus, juxta vires. And these
were termed milites per Sacramentum.

The word in the Greek is (...), a mystery, or a hidden secret belonging to
holy things, known but to few, and not to be communicated but to those that are
initiated or let into the Church. From (...), sacris initior or instituor
doctrina quae ad res sacras pertinet, I am instructed in the Doctrine
concerning holy things. But the word Mystery is of larger acceptance than
Sacrament.

A Sacrament is called a Mystery, because it signifies secret things, and
such things as are unknown to those who have not been taught out of the Word of
God, concerning the signification and use of them; and because there one thing
is seen, and another thing is meant.

The lawful use of the Sacraments is not the observation of the external Rite,
but to have faith to reserve the Rite it self, to that end to which it was
ordained by God.

For to the Sacraments of the Covenant of Grace no other promise is annexed or
added, but the promise of Grace, which has always the condition of faith with
it, either expressed or employed*

Faith is the instrument, medium, or hand, by which the things signified and
offered by God, are received both in the Word, and also in the Sacraments.

Christ Himself by His Spirit does make the things promised, present to our
faith, and so faith receives them.

In the right use of the Sacrament, the giving and receiving the sign and thing
signified, is joined and goes together.

The giving and receiving of the sign is bodily by the hand of the Minister and
receiver; but the giving and receiving of the thing signified is spiritual,
through true faith in the receiver, and by the hand of Christ Himself giving it.

A Sacrament in proper speech, comprehends the whole action, as well the sign
as the thing signified. But by a Synechdoche it is taken only for the sign, the
outward visible sign of the inward invisible and spiritual Grace.

The outward and earthly matter of the Sacrament, is, the visible sign or
element.

The inward and heavenly matter of the Sacrament, is, the things signified,
Christ with all His benefits.

The external form consists in the lawful administration and participation of
the Sacrament according to the command of God.

The inward form is in the Analogy, proportion or union of the sign, and the
thing signified; which is a spiritual relation whereby the things signified are
really communicated to them who rightly receive and use the signs.

The Sacraments are signs in a fourfold respect,

1 Signifying. 2 Exhibiting. 3 Applying. 4* Sealing.

1. The outward signs in the Sacrament do signify or represent the body and
blood of Christ.

2. Together with the sign, the thing signified is exhibited and given; yet not
in the sign or element, but in the sacramental action, the Minister giving the
sign or element, but our Lord Jesus Christ gives the thing signified.

3. The thing signified in the Word of the Gospel generally promised to all
true believers, is applied to every believing Soul, the outward sign or element
being exhibited and given unto them.

4. The same promise is sealed in the Sacrament, whence it is they are not
called signs only, but seals also. So we have it in the Word, Abraham received
Romans 4. 11.
the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of faith* which he had,
etc.

There are three things required in a Sacrament. 1. The outward signs and
sacramental actions concerning the same. 2. The inward things signified
thereby, namely, Christ Jesus with His saving Graces: and Spiritual actions
conc^rning the same. 3. A similitude and likeness between them both.

As for example, In Baptism as water does wash away the filth of the Body, so
the blood of Christ does wash away the spots of the Soul. As the bread and wine
do nourish and feed the Body, so the body and blood of Christ laid hold on by
true and lively faith, do nourish and cherish the Soul to eternal life.

The signs used in the Sacraments, are either, 1. Representing, as Water, Bread
and Wine. Or, 2. Applying, as washing, eating, drinking, etc.

The signs and the things signified in both Sacraments do so agree, that the
sign does so fitly represent the things signified thereby, that the mind of a
Christian is drawn by the signs to consider of the things thereby signified.
The ends of Sacraments are, the sealing of the Covenant of Grace; or more fully
thus in these three particulars.

1. To help our understanding, and insight; therefore the Sacraments are as
clear glasses. So the Apostle said to Gal. 3. 1.
the Galatians, in regard of the celebration of the Lords Supper* that Christ
was crucified before their eyes; that is, Sacramentally, in the breaking of the
Bread, and pouring forth of the Wine: whereas we know that corporally Christ
was crucified at Jerusalem, which was far distant from the region of Galatia.

2. To help our memories, to bring to our remembrance, as lasting Monuments; Do
this (said our Savior) in Luke 22. 19. 1 Cor. 11. 24.
remembrance of Me.

3. To persuade our hearts, and to confirm our faith, as most certain seals and
pledges to assure and strengthen us in the promises of Salvation; which God
has not only made to us in word, but confirmed it by writing; and lest we
should any ways doubt (as naturally we are inclined to do) therefore He has
set to His seals, that nothing may be lacking to increase and strengthen our
faith: from whence the Sacraments become not only marks and pledges of our
Christian profession; but also so many bonds to bind us to obedience.

So that hereby not only the free Grace of God, and the promises are sealed to
us on Gods part; but also our thankfulness and obedience toward God.

This is the primary end of the Sacrament: and the secondary end is, the
profession of our faith and charity.

For there are represented in our use of the Sacraments, not only that union
which we have with God in Christ; but also that communion which we embrace with
all those who are partakers of the same union with us.

We must understand and believe that the efficacy of the Sacrament is not
included in the external element, but wholly comes from the good Spirit of God,
as He is pleased to show His manifest power by those instruments, that so He
may help our weakness.

For if we were wholly spiritual as the Angels are, then we should be able
spiritually to contemplate God and His gifts; but now since we are overshadowed
with this lump of our earthly body, it is necessary that God should by certain
figures, as it were by glasses (as I said before) represent unto us spiritual
and heavenly things, who cannot otherwise conceive of them in our minds. For
now we see as through a glass 1 Cor. 13. 12.
darkly.

We enjoy the efficacy of the Sacraments, when we receive them by faith.

Of Baptism.
NOw come we particularly to speak of the two Sacraments, and first of Baptism.

Baptism is a Greek word, from (...), immergo, abluo; which is primitively
derived from (...), mergo, tingo, to dip or plunge into water; signifying
properly, such a kind of washing as is used in Bucks, where linen is plunged
and dipped. Yet it is taken more largely, for any kind of washing, rinsing or
clensing, where there is no dipping at all, as Mat. 3. 11. and 20. 22, etc.

Christ nowhere requires dipping, but only baptizing; which word (...) or
(...) implies no more than lavatio, ablutio; washing or ablution, which may be
done without dipping.

This word Baptism is used many ways. Dr. Featly.


1. Generally, for washing, Luke 11. 38. Heb. 9. 20. the Pharisee marvailed
Christ washed not before dinner.

2. Figuratively, for great and sharp afflictions, Mat. 20. 22. Luke 12. 50, I
have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straightened till it be
accomplished.

3. To sprinkle or wash ones body Sacramentally, Mat. 3. 11. John said, I
indeed baptize you with water, etc.

4. For the whole work and action of the Sacrament of Baptism, as Mat. 28. 19,
Go and teach all Nations, baptizing them, etc.

5. Spiritually, to wash the Conscience, Mat. 3. 11, He shall baptize you with
the Holy Ghost and with fire. Acts 1. 5. Ye shall be baptized with the Holy
Ghost.

6. The native and proper signification is, to dip into water, or to plunge
under water, tanquam ad tingendum mergo. Acts 8. 38. Philip and the Eunuch went
down both into the water. Mat. 3. 16* Jesus when he was baptized went up out of
the water. So Joh. 3. 22, 23.

There is a fourfold Baptism. 1. Fluminis seu aquae, which is a Baptism of
water, Mat. 3. 11, I baptize you with water, etc.

2. Luminis seu doctrinae, Mat. 21. 25. the Baptism of John is put for the
whole Ministry of John, both his Preaching, and his Baptism, Acts. 18. 25.
Apollos knew only the Baptism of John.

3. Flaminis, seu donorum Spiritus Sancti. Acts 1. 5, Ye shall be baptized with
the Holy Ghost, that is, with the gifts of the Holy Ghost.

4. Sanguinis seu martyrii, a Baptism of Blood or Martyrdom: so Christ asked
the Apostles, Can ye be baptized with the Baptism that I am baptized with? Mat.
20. 22, 23.

Baptism represents unto us two things.

1. The forgiveness of Sins. 2. Spiritual regeneration.

Q. But what proportion has water with these, that it should be a sign of
these things?

A. 1. Because the remission of sins is in a sense like unto a laver; whereby
the sinfulnesses and defilements which are in our minds are cleansed, as the
filthiness of our body is washed away with water.

2. The beginning of our regeneration is, that our nature should be mortified;
as the end is, that we should be newcreatures: the pouring of water signifies a
death, and in that runs away from us, and we remain not under it, it signifies
a return unto life; as the words in our Church-Catechism are, a death unto sin,
and a new birth unto righteousness. So said the Apostle, buried with Christ in
Baptism, wherein also we are risen with Him through faith, etc. Col. 2. 12.


God who usually accompanies His own Ordinance with His blessing, will not
frustrate our expectation in any of those good things which He has promised;
therefore we must strive to be persuaded that remission of sins and
regeneration or a renewedness of life, by Baptism is offered unto us, and that
we receive it therein. In as much as by Baptism we are incorporated into
Christ, and receive His Holy Spirit, unless we reject the promises there made
unto us, and so render them unprofitable to our selves.

The right use of Baptism is placed in faith and repentance; if thou would
use Baptism aright as it should be, then repent and believe; so we read in
sundry places of the Gospels, and also in the Acts of the Apostles: that is,
that we be persuaded that we are purged by the blood of Christ from our sins,
and be sensible that we have His holy Spirit dwelling in us: and so daily to
meditate of mortifying our corrupt flesh, and of yielding obedience to all Gods
commands.

Baptism is a Sacrament of the New Testament, by the washing of water
representing the powerful washing of Ephesians. 5. 26.
the Blood and Spirit of Christ, and so 1 Cor. 6. 11. Heb. 10. 22.
sealing up our regeneration or new birth, our entrance into the Covenant of
Grace, our ingraffing into Christ, and into His mystical body which is the Joh.
3. 5. Tit. 3. 5.
Church, Acts 8. 27.

This Sacramental washing seals to those that are within Gods Covenant, their
birth in Christ, and entrance into Christianity.

The Covenant which is in general to all believers, is in Baptism especially
made and established with every one of the faithful. And it is always ratified
and sure, even to them that fall, when they do repent. (Although Novatus and
his Sect taught otherwise). Neither do they enter into a new Covenant after
their falls; but that which was entered into, is restored, renewed, and
confirmed again. We must often meditate on, and consider of the Covenant made
and entered into in our Baptism.

Baptism came in place of circumcision, and keeps analogy and proportion with
it; for both of them were a Sacrament of entrance, or of receiving into the
Covenant of Grace.

Baptism came in place of circumcision;

1. By the command of God: God sent John to baptize with water; so we have it
Joh. 1. 33.

2. By the Ministry of John: therefore he was called John the Baptist; so we
have it, Mat. 3. 1, In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the
wilderness, etc.

3. It was sanctified and confirmed by our Savior Christ Himself, being
baptized by John, Mat. 3. 13.

4. By his giving commission to His Apostles and Ministers, to continue the
Mat. 28. 18.
same in His Church unto the end.

Baptism is therefore also called the circumcision made without hands (or true
regeneration in the Spirit) in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh,
Col. 2. 11*
by the circumcision of Christ. That is, by virtue of the gift of regeneration,
which is the spiritual circumcision, whereof Christ alone is the worke^. Buried
with Him in Baptism, etc.

So Baptism is our Circumcision, on comes to us in the place of Circumcision*
that is, by which the same things are confirmed, and in all things assured to
us in the N^w Testament, which were confirmed and conferred on those in the Old
Testament by Circumcision.

The words of institution of Baptism, are recorded in Mat. 28. 19. Mark 16. 14.
Go ye into all the world, and preach the^ Gospel to every creature (that is* to
every rational and intelligent creature,) or, Teach all Nations, baptizing them
in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: He that believes
and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not, shall be damned.

To be baptized in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
signifies and imports these things.

1. That it is done by the command of God.

2. To testify, that by this Rite and Ceremony, that he that is thus baptized,
is received into Grace and favor, by the eternal Father, for and through His
Son, and is sanctified by the Holy Ghost. We must still understand this of
believers and them alone; for Mark 16. 1^, He that believes not shall be
damned; and that for all his Baptism unless he believe. So here is the
principal end of Baptism.

3. To be baptized in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is to show
that the p^^son baptized, is bound to know and acknowledge, to believe and
trust* in, to worship and fear* to honor and call upon this true God, Father,
Son,* and Holy Ghost; and this is the second end of Baptism, which St. Paul
shows in these words, 1 Cor. 1. 13* Were ye baptized* in the name of ^aul* ^^
as much as if he had said, ye must be His to whom in Baptism ye have given and
obliged your selves given your names unto, and in whose name ye were bapti^e^.

Of Baptism there are two parts.

1. The water of Baptism.

2. The lawful use thereof.

1. By the water of Baptism is signified both the Spirit and the Blood of
Christ spilt upon the Cross. This is that blood of sprinkling, which speaks
better Heb: 12. 24.
things than that of Abel. We are redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, as
of a lamb without blemish and without 1 Pet. 1. 19.
spot. This is the fountain opened for sin, and for uncleanness. Zech. 13. 1.


As the Blood of Christ, so also the Spirit of Christ is signified by the water
of Baptism. Therefore said our Savior, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me
Joh. 7. 37, 38, 39.
and drink; he that believes on Me, out of His belly shall flow rivers of
living water: this spoke He of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him
should receive.

John indeed baptized with water; but Acts 11. 16
^e shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.

The lawful use of the water of Bap^ism is perceived in the action both of the
Minister administering it, and also of the faithful who receive Baptism.

The action of the Minister is two^old.

1. The Sanctification of the water.

2. The outward washing.

1. The Sanctification of the water is the setting it apart to this end, to
signify the Blood and Spirit of Christ by His ordinance and institution, which
the words of institution do declare.

2. The outward washing is a most sure sign, pledge, and seal of the inward
washing, whereby we with the Blood and Spirit of Christ are washed from out
sins. He has washed us from our sins Rev. 1. 5.
in His own blood. So many of us as Romans 3. 1.
are baptized into Jesus Christ, are baptized into His death. Christ loved the
Church, and gave Himself for it; th^^ He might sanctify and cleanse it, by the
Ephesians. 5. 25, 26.
washing of water through the word. The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
1 John 1. 7.
all sin.

As the filthiness of the body is washed away with water, so we are purged from
our sins by the blood and spirit of Christ. Ye are washed, ye are sanctified* 1
Cor. 6. 11.
ye are justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.

That inward washing is made or done both by the blood, and by the spirit of
Christ.

1. Washing through the blood o^ Christ, is Justification. So we have it Acts
22. 16, Arise and be baptized, calling on the name of the Lord.

2. Washing through the spirit, is regeneration, when we are by the Holy Spirit
regenerated or born again to a new life. 1 Cor. 6. 11.


Thus far of the action of the Minister, now to speak of the action of him or
her baptized.

Every faithful person that is baptized, receives the outward Baptism of
water, that there may be signified and sealed up unto him, that he is assuredly
washed from his sins by the blood and spirit of Christ, as surely as his body
is sprinkled or washed with water. Then will I Ezekiel. 36. 25.
sprinkle, said the Lord, clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean; from all
your filthinesses and from all your Idols I will cleanse you.

To be washed with the blood and spirit of Christ, signifies, to be made
partakers of the Covenant of Grace; namely, to be reconciled to God, justified,
regenerated, adopted, to be the Son or Child of God, and to be endowed with the
freedom of the Sons of God.

All are washed with water, but believers only by the blood and spirit of
Christ.

Therefore not all that are baptized receive remission of sins and
regeneration, but the believers only. For without a man have his name in the
Covenant, the seal set to it confirms nothing unto him. To the receiving of the
Sacrament (as very worthily it is in our Liturgy) there must be adjoined
thanksgiving, which is presently performed by every person that is baptized, if
he be adult or of years of discretion; or by the witnesses in his stead if he
be an infant, who when he comes to years of discretion, all his life long ought
to be thankful unto God for this benefit.

Q. What are the ends of Baptism?

A. Especially these four.

1. To be a seal to us of our receiving into the Covenant of Grace, and
fellowship with Christ and His Church.

2. By the outward washing to represent and confirm to us, the inward cleansing
of our Souls, which stands in justification and regeneration, Ephesians. 5. 26. So
in this sense, Baptism (as it is 1 Pet. 3. 21.) is said to save us, because it
seals unto us eternal salvation.

3. To mind us of repentance and reforming our lives: for we are baptized with
water unto repentance. Mat. 3. 11.


4. To be sealed to the certain hope of resurrection, and of an eternal blessed
life.

In Baptism, Original sin is washed and taken away, especially as concerning
the guilt, that is to say, the fault and the punishment; there remaining
notwithstanding the vitiation and the sickness, namely, wicked lusts and
inclination to evil: and that to this end, that we might all our life long
fight against sin, and the Devil who is the Author of sin. But the Papists say,
that by Baptism rightly administered, not only the guiltiness, but also the
corruption of Original sin is so washed away, as that it is not afterward
properly accounted a sin. But we contrarily distinguish thus of sin; sin in
regard of the guiltiness or obnoxiousness to the wrath of God, and also in
regard of the punishment together by one act is taken away in Baptism. But in
regard of that error and corruption of Nature, it is not at the first wholly
taken away, but successively, and by little and little, or by degrees it is
extinguished, even as our renovation or renewing by the Holy Ghost is by little
and little begun, increased and carried on in us.

And this we evince by these four reasons.

1. Else St. Paul would not so greatly bewail his Original sin, if after
Baptism it ceased to be a sin: when as he cried out, O miserable man that I am,
who shall Romans 7. 23, 24.
deliver me from the body of this death^ I see another law in my members,
warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law
of sin, which is in my members.

2. Original sin is called a sin exceeding or out of measure sinful: and a sin
that hangs fast on, or easily encompasseth Romans 7. 13.
us about. Heb. 12. 1.


3. Concupiscence is the root of actual sin, and therefore after Baptism it
must needs properly be a sin.

4. Unless that concupiscence were a sin, where would or could be that vehement
and hot combat between the flesh and the spirit; for the flesh lusts against
Gal. 5. 17.
the spirit, and the spirit against the ^lesh; and these are contrary the one
to the other.

Q. Why was Christ baptized? what could Baptism signify or seal unto Him? He
had no sin to wash away.

A. ^. That He might fulfill all righteousness, that is, for us and on our
behalf, Mat. 3. 15.

2. That He might in His own person commend and confirm Baptism against all
those who so debase and decry it.

3. That He might sanctify our Baptism in Himself.

4. That by Baptism we might know Him to have entered into His office, and the
execution of it.

Q. How does Baptism belong to Infants, and how are they capable of performing
the conditions required?

A. I have perused the learned Exercitations of Mr. John Tombs, B. D. formerly
a Cotemporary with me in Magdalen-Hall, who is the best and most learned of
that opinion and persuasion, who has many arguments against Infant Baptism,
which require a large volume particularly to answer. I shall therefore only lay
down some argument to assert the laudable use of the Churches Infant Baptism,
which do fully convince and satisfy me, and I suppose by God's blessing on
serious meditation and consideration may satisfy those which will not wilfully
close their eyes against the truth.

themselves, and also of the Church, 1 Cor. 7. 14.
is confirmed by this sign, that God will be the God and Savior as of the
faithful Parents, so of their seed and children: which promise of His, He at
His good Romans 8. 29, 30. Tit. 3. 5.
time performs in His elect.

2. Because to them belongs also the promise of forgiveness of sins, through
the blood of Christ.

3. Because they belong to the Church of God.

4. Because they are redeemed by the blood of Christ.

5. Because to them is promised the Holy Ghost.

6. Because they are to be discerned from the Children of Infidels.

7. Because in the Old Testament Infants were circumcised. As Circumcision was
then the first beginning or initiating Sacrament into the Jewish Church, so is
Baptism the first beginning of Christianity. There can be no reason given to
deprive Infants of Baptism, but that which may be given against circumcision;
the main whereof is, the incapableness of Infants of the Grace of the
Sacraments. But He that said of Infants, to them belongs the Kingdom of God,
knows how to settle upon them the title of that Kingdom.

And we have no reason to think, but that even before, or in, at, or by, the
act of Baptism, the Spirit of Christ does unite the Soul of the elect Infant
unto Christ, and cloth it with His righteousness, and impute unto it the title
of a Son or a Daughter by adoption, and the Image of God by Sanctification, and
so fit it for the state of Glory.

8. To them to whom the Covenant belongs, to them belongs the seal of the
Covenant that confirms the right to them: But to the Infants of faithful
Parents the Covenant belongs; to you Acts 2. 39.
and to your Children are the promises Mark. 10* 13.
made; and to them belongs the Kingdom of God. Therefore we rationally
conclude, that if the thing it self belongs to them, therefore the sign and
seal thereof.

9. Your Children are Holy, 1 Cor. 7. 14. there is a faederal Sanctity, or an
external and visible Holiness, at least in Children of believing Parents: and
they are to be judged of the true flock of Christ, until they show the contrary.



We read of nothing in Scripture that Solution.
does infringe the liberty of the Church therein, neither do the Scriptures
afford any proofs by consequence of it, to deter from it. We read of several
whole households baptized, doubtless some Infants were therein.

And if the Scriptures not expressing directly the baptizing of Infants, were a
sufficient reason of denying that Sacrament to them, is a senseless thing.

Circumcision was a sign of repentance ( Deuteronomy. 10. 16. Jer. 4. 14.) and a sign
of faith, ( Romans 4. 11.) and yet Infants were not kept from Circumcision, but
God commanded them to be circumcised the eighth day, which is a sufficient
ground to us for baptizing of Infants. For the ancient promises of God to the
people of Israel, belong now to every believer in any Nation whatsoever.

Since God under the Law showed Himself the Savior of Infants, and commanded
them to be signed with such a visible sign as Circumcision was; it would be a
very grievous and a hard thing if the Children of believers now under the
Gospel, since the coming of Christ, should have less privilege, than the
Infants of the fathers of old, seeing the same promise is to us as was to them.
And God has now more manifestly declared His goodness to us in Christ.

The promise belongs to Infants: Acts 2. 37.
therefore St. Peter would have his hearers to repent and to be baptized, and
he adds the reason, because the promise belonged to them and to their Children,
etc. whence I argue, because they are partakers of the promise, therefore they
are bid to be baptized.

Or thus, the promise belongs to the adult repentant persons and their Children
or Infants: therefore adult repentant persons and their Children or Infants are
to be baptized for remission of sins.

The adult (or those of years) are to be baptized upon their repentance: and
the Children or Infants of those repenting baptized persons, yea, before they
are actually capable of repentance, are to be baptized also, for the promise is
made unto them upon the account of their Parents.

So St. Peter there, commands them to be baptized, and why? because the promise
is made unto them.

So also he shows the cause why those adult repentant persons are commanded to
be baptized: which is, not because they were adult or repentant, and so Baptism
belonged only to them: but also it belonged to their Infants; and so he proves
that as well the Infants as the adult should be baptized. Not because they
believe or do not believe, but because they are partakers of the promise.

Regeneration or receiving into Grace, is enough for Infants.

Much more might have been said to several others of their arguments which are
many, and would digress into a large volume; but I shall dwell no longer hereon.

Although we be but once baptized* yet Baptism is unto us a perpetual Sacrament
of our washing from sin, and of our regeneration: that is to say, as Baptism
does not only evacuate and wash away Original Sin (in the sense before
premised) but also all other Sins, either past, or present: for they that are
baptized, are baptized into Christ's death* Now Christ's death is available not
only to wash away those Sins that are before Baptism, but those also in our
whole life which follow Baptism.

Q. What ground or warrant have we for sprinkling, which is commonly used with
us in these cold Countries?

A. Our Church allows no other than dipping (unless in case of the Child's
weakness) as most consonant to our Savior's Baptism, where we read of His
descending into the water, and coming Mat. 3.
up again out of the water. Others conceive the very action of sprinkling water
very warrantable, especially in young Children, to whom farther wetting may be
dangerous to them.

The reasons are such as these,

1. Because neither dipping nor sprinkling is essential to the Sacrament of
Baptism: but only washing and applying water to the body, as a cleanser of the
filth thereof.

2. As in the other Sacrament (that of the Lord's Supper) a spoonful of Wine is
as significant as a whole gallon; so here a handful of water is as significant
as a whole river.

3. The action of sprinkling bears fit resemblance with the inward Grace, as
well as dipping; and has authority also in the Scriptures.

We read of sprinkling of the blood 1 Pet. 1. 2. Heb. 12. 14.
of Christ: and the blood of sprinkling which speaks better things than the
blood of Abel.

4. It is not unlikely that the Apostles baptized as well by sprinkling or
pouring water upon, as by dipping into it. Since we read of dive^^ baptized in
houses as well as in rivers. However the washing of the body with water is
essential, though Ephesians. 5. 26.
whether way it be done seems not to be essential, so water be applied to the
body for the cleansing of it.

Q. How do Circumcision and Baptism agree?

A. 1. In the principal end: for the promise of Grace through and by Christ
(which was the same in all ages) is sealed in both of them.

2. In both is signified regeneration, and a promise of faith and obedience
toward God.

3. Both Circumcision and Baptism are the Sacrament of our reception and
entrance into the Church.

Q. Wherein do Circumcision and Baptism differ?

A. 1. In the Rite or Ceremony, which is not the same in Baptism as in
Circumcision: for in Baptism is only a washing, but in Circumcision, a cutting
off the foreakin of the flesh.

2. In the circumstance of the sex or age: Circumcision belonged only to Males,
and at eight days old; Baptism belongs to both sexes Male and Female, and
presently after they are born.

3. In the manner of signifying: Circumcision (on God's part) promised Grace,
through the Messiah to come; but Baptism through Christ already come. And (on
their part) they being Circumcised were received into Grace, by believing on
the Messiah to come; but we through faith in Him already come.

4. In the particular promise: Circumcision had also the promise of corporal
blessings, as of the land of Canaan, etc. But Baptism has no such special
promise of any temporal benefit.

5. In the manner of obliging: Circumcision on their part obliged them to the
keeping of the whole Law, Ceremonial, Judicial and Moral; but Baptism obliges
us only to the keeping of the Moral Law, that is, to faith and repentance.

6. In the objects and duration: Circumcision was commanded to the posterity of
Abraham only, and the Proselytes, and was to endure but till the coming of
Christ: Baptism is instituted for all Nations that will come into the society
of the Church, and to endure to the end of the world. To close up all with
these few heads.

Aphorisms about Baptism.
1. Baptism avails though administered by a contemptible person, as much as if
it were administered by an Apostle; for if Baptism were in the merit or worth of
the Minister, then it did not belong unto Christ.

2. The power of baptizing the Lord has reserved to Himself, it is Christ
alone that baptizes with the Holy Ghost: the applying of the outward Element
Christ has committed to His Ministers lawfully called and deputed.

3. Baptism is the same as He is by whose power and authority it is
administered: Not as He is by whom it is performed.

4. Every true believer in Baptism is made a King, and a Priest and Prophet,
Rev. 1. 5. Christ washes us from our sins in His own blood, and so makes us
Kings and Priests unto God and His Father. So St. Crysostome, When as Christ
has washed us from our sins (in the laver of Baptism) by His blood, He makes
us Kings and Priests unto God.

Baptism, as we have seen, is a high Ordinance of God, and a means whereby He
has appointed to communicate Christ and His benefits to our Souls: and
therefore not to be neglected or slightly esteemed, but used with all reverence
and thankful devotion, when it may be had. Yet where God denies it, either in
regard of the shortness of the Infants life, or by any other unavoidable
necessity; there comes no danger from the want of Sacraments, but only from the
contempt of them.

The right use of Baptism is, when inwardly in thy heart thou feel some
motion to sin, through thy lusts, then meditate on that solemn vow thou made
to God in thy Baptism. And if by infirmity thou fallest once or oftener into
some sin, still have recourse to Baptism, that thy Soul may be encouraged
therehence. For although Baptism be but once administered, yet that once
testifies that all man's sins past, present, or to come, are washed away, 1
Pet. 3. 21. Ephesians. 5. 25, 26, 27. And never rest, before thou have a feeling of
that renewing power signified in Baptism: namely, the power of Christ's death
Mortifying sin, and the virtue of His resurrection, in the renewing of the
Spirit.

EXERCITATION THE THIRD.
Of the Lords Supper, the second Sacrament of the New Testament.
IT has several appellations; it is called,

1. The Lord's Supper, or Caena Domini, from the Greek word (...) Communis:
caena vocatur a communione vescentium. For seorsim prandebant prisci Romani,
sed cum amicis caenabant. About Supper-time the Jews were to eat the Paschal
Lamb; which circumstance of time the Church has changed according to the
liberty in these things she has. It is called the Lord's Supper, because our
Lord Jesus Christ sitting at His last Supper, ordained it instead of the
Passover.

2. It is called the Table of the Lord, 1 Cor. 10. 21.

3. A convention of the Church, 1 Cor. 11. 20, 33, When ye meet together in one
place, etc. And, When ye come together to eat.

4. The Eucharist, because of the usual Thanksgiving.

5. A Sacrifice: so it was called by the ancient Fathers, non (...) aut
meritorium, not a propitiatory or meritorious Sacrifice, as the Papists would
have it, but an Eucharistical Sacrifice; because it is a solemn commemoration
and celebration of the propitiatory Sacrifice of Christ.

6. At length it was called Missa, from the offerings sent by the rich, to the
relief of the Poor; or from a dismission of the Congregation after the public
Ordinances: But we retaining the appellation or name delivered in Scripture,
call it the Supper of the Lord.

There are many detestable and abominable differences between the Lord's
Supper, and the Popish Mass, which I think not fit here to recite, as not at
all for edification.

I define the Lords Supper thus: The instituted and commanded distribution of
Bread and Wine, by Christ Himself, in which Christ is certainly promised to me
and all true believers. Or thus,

The Lord's Supper, is the distributing and taking of Bread and Wine commanded
by Christ to all true believers, that He might testify by these tokens, that
He gave His body to death for us, and shed His blood; and that He gave us these
to eat and drink, to assure us that He will dwell in us, and nourish and
quicken us to eternal life.

First, He assures and seals, that He gave His body for us upon the Cross, and
that His blood was as truly shed for us, as we see with our eyes the bread to
be broken for us, and the cup to be given to us. Next, that He by that His body
Crucified, and by that His blood poured out, will as certainly nourish our
Souls to eternal life, as surely as our bodies are fed by Bread and Wine, taken
from the hand of the Minister, which are reached forth unto us as seals and
pledges of the body and blood of Christ.

The Rites or Signs here, are the Bread broken and eaten, the Wine distributed
and taken; or the breaking and distributing of the Bread, the distributing and
drinking of the Wine.

The things signified are, the body of Christ Crucified, and the blood of
Christ poured out: the eating and drinking of them, signify our union with
Christ by faith, whereby we being made partakers of Him and all His benefits,
from Him (as branches from a Vine) do suck and draw eternal life, or
nourishment to eternal life.

Of this our union and communion with Christ we are certified,

1. By the analogy or proportion between the sign and the thing signified.

2. By the promise which is added to the sign.

The analogy chiefly proposes two things to us.

1. The Sacrifice of Christ.

2. Our Communion with him. Because the bread is not only broken, but also is
given to us to eat.

Or more clearly thus: The Lord's Supper is the second Sacrament of the New
Testament, wherein by the outward elements of Bread and Wine, sanctified and
exhibited by the Minister, and rightly received by the Communicants assurance
is given to those that are ingra^sed into Christ of their continuance in Him,
and receiving nourishment from Him unto eternal life.

In the same sense it is also called the Lord's Table; thou do therefore come
to the banquet of Christ, to be His guest, as often as thou do eat and drink
of this Supper.

The Lord's Supper came in stead of the Passover or Paschal Lamb, not because
He appointed it a Supper unto us, but because He ordained it in room of the
Passover.

For in the same night wherein He was 1 Cor. 11. 23.
betrayed, immediately after He had eaten the Passover with His Disciples, He
did both Himself with them celebrate Mat* 26. 26.
this Holy Sacrament, and withal gave charge for continuance of the same in the
Church until His second 1 Cor. 11. 20*
coming.

The parts of the Lord's Supper are two: 1. The earthly matter or the outward
signs. 2. The action requisite for the use of the outward sign.

The outward sign or earthly matter is again twofold: 1. The Bread. 2. The Wine.

1. The Bread of the Lord, is Christ's body given to death for us; so Christ
said, This is my body which is given for you.

2. The Cup of the Lord, is that New Covenant through His blood which was shed
for us. By a Synechdoche the Cup is put for the Wine contained in the Cup. Then
by a Sacramental Metonymie, because neither the Cup, nor the Wine in the Cup,
is substantially that very new Covenant which was confirmed by Christ's blood
shed for us: but it is the Sacrament of that Covenant, and that in a double
respect.

1. Because it is an outward sign calling to our remembrance, and as it were
representing before our eyes, that New Covenant or Testament established by the
blood of Christ.

2. Because it is a seal of our faith, sealing up the certainty of that
Covenant, and the continuance of it with us. So the Wine is a Sacrament of the
blood of Christ, not contained in the veins, but shed out of His body upon the
Cross, or as it was shed for the forgiveness of sins. So our Savior said, This
Mat. 26. 28.
is My blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many for the remission of
sins. Also here by Bread and Wine is noted out unto us, that we do perfectly
and wholly find in Christ, not meat alone, but drink also: that is, not only
one cause or part of Salvation and eternal life, but whatsoever wholly is
requisite or necessary thereunto.

Q. What are the ends of the Lord's Supper?

A. 1. To confirm our faith, and to be a most sure testification of our union
and communion with Christ. For Christ by these signs testifies to us, that He
by His body and blood, does as truly nourish us to eternal life, as truly as we
receive these signs out of the hand of the Minister. And this testification is
directed to every particular person, that with true faith receives these signs
or symbols. And we so receive these elements out of the hand of the Minister,
as if Jesus Christ Himself did reach it forth with His own hand unto us.

2. That it may be a public profession of our faith, and a solemn thanksgiving
with an obliging our selves to perpetual thankfulness, and* a celebration of
this so great a benefit. And these are included in Christ's words, This do in
remembrance Luke 22. 19.
of Me.

This commemoration is chiefly faith in the heart, joined with a public
confession and thanksgiving.

3. That it may be a public distinction or discerning mark, between the true
Church of Christ, and all other Nations and Sects whatsoever. For the Lord
instituted this for His Disciples, and not for others.

4. That it might be a bond of Love between all those who lawfully take it, to
become Members of one body, under one Head, the Lord Jesus Christ. We being
many are one bread and one body; 1 Cor. 10. 7.
for we are all partakers of that one bread. Now the Members of the same body
do mutually love each other.

5. That it may be a bond of the public meetings of the Church; for the
institution of this Sacrament is, that it be done in the public Assembly or
Congregation. Thence are those words, When ye come together into one place; And
1 Cor. 11. 20, 33.
when ye come together to eat, etc.

Or more briefly thus: The ends of the Lord's Supper are,

1. To be a remembrance of Christ's Sacrifice performed on the Cross.

2. To be a sign of the Covenant of Grace established by the blood of Christ.

3. To be a Sacrament of the nourishing, continuance, and preservation of them
in the Church, which once by Baptism have been ingraffed into the Church of
Christ. Our Lord Jesus Christ by this Sacrament does teach us, by the communion
of His body and blood that our Souls are nourished in hope of eternal life.

By the Bread Christ represent His body to us, and by the Wine his blood; to
show unto us, that as there is in Bread a nourishing faculty, to feed and
strengthen our bodies for this present life: So His body has a nourishing and
quickening power with it, spiritually to nourish our souls.

In like manner also, as Wine exhilarates and cheers the heart of him that
drinks it, refreshes his spirits, and makes the whole body the more strong:
Even so Christ's blood does strengthen our hearts, and fill them with joy and
gladness. We do truly by faith feed on the body and blood of Christ, when we
are p^rswaded that we shall be saved by His obedience, righteousness, and
satisfaction to His Father on our behalf, as the Father imputes it unto us.

Therefore we must necessarily have an interest in Christ; for we can never be
partakers of His good benefits, unless first He had given Himself unto us.

By this Sacrament our communion with Christ is confirmed and sealed.

The Lord's Supper refers us to the death of Christ, that we may so communicate
of His virtue: for upon the Cross that His own and perpetual Sacrifice was
offered for our redemption. He redeemed us by His blood; and He made atonement
for us by the blood of his Cross.

So we do not (as the Papists say) offer up the body of Christ to the Father,
for Christ Himself alone is worthy of that honor, who was both Priest and
Sacrifice, and who offered up Himself, He remains a Priest for ever. And when
He said, take and eat, He commanded Heb. 5. 6.
us not to offer up His body, but only to feed on it.

So also another abuse of the Papists is, to deny the Cup to the people:
whereas Christ in His institution said, Drink ye all of this. It is a high
Sacrilegious impiety, thus expressly to go against Christ's institution in His
own words.

It is by faith alone we eat the body, and drink the blood of Christ. And yet
we say not that the body of Christ is included in the Bread, and His blood
included in the Cup: but if we will enjoy the truth and reality of the
Sacrament, we must have our hearts lifted up heaven-wards, and look upwards;
where Christ is in the glory of His Father, and from whence He shall come to be
our Judge: for he that seeks Him corporally in these corruptible elements,
manifestly errs.

So for me to eat the body of Christ crucified for me, and to drink His blood
shed for me, is not only firmly to believe the whole passion and death of
Christ, and by it to obtain remission of Joh. 6. 35. to 54.
sins and everlasting life; but also by His Spirit which dwells in me, to be
more and more united to His blessed body: as Christ there said, He that eats
My Joh. 6. 56.
^lesh, and drinks My blood, dwells in Me, and I in him.

So that although Christ is in Heaven, and we on Earth, yet we are flesh of His
flesh, and bone of His bone. Ephesians. 5. 30. and 3. 16, 17. and 4. 15, 16. Joh. 6.
57.


Even as all the members of the body are quickened and directed by one soul, so
are we by one and the self same S-pirit. So then our eating the body, and
drinking the blood of Christ, which is not corporally but spiritually done,
signifies four things:

1. Our believing of the passion and death of Christ. 2. Our receiving
remission of sins and everlasting life by faith in Him. 3. Our union with
Christ by His Holy Spirit which dwells both in Christ and us. 4. The benefit
of quickening by the same Holy Spirit.
So to eat the body and drink the blood of Christ, is to believe that we
through the merits of Christ, are received by God into grace and favor; and by
the same faith we receive remission of sins, and are reconciled unto God; and
that the Son of God (that Word which was made flesh) who has Joh. 1. 14.
united to Himself our humane nature (which He personally took) does dwell in
us, and has joined us to Himself and His assumed humane nature, by pouring
upon us His Holy Spirit, by which He regenerates us, and restores light in us,
righteousness and eternal life, the same which shines in His assumed humane
nature.

Or more briefly thus: to eat the body of Christ is,

1. To believe in Him.

2. By faith, to receive remission of sins.

3. To be united unto Christ.

4. To be made partaker of the life of Christ, or to be conformable to Christ
by His Holy Spirit, which works the same things both in Christ and in us.

This our eating is our communion with Christ, which the Scripture teaches,
and which in this Sacrament we do profess; namely our spiritual union with
Christ, such as is of the members with the head, and of the branches with the
vine.

This eating of His flesh, Christ teaches in John 6. and confirms it by
these outward signs in the Lord's Supper.

For in the Lord's Supper as we do eat the Bread, and drink the Wine, even so
there as surely Christ gives to all true believers His body to eat, and His
blood to drink.

This is clearly manifested to us in the words of institution, Mat. 26. 26, 27,
28. 1 Cor. 11. 23, 24, 25. And this promise is repeated by St. Paul, 1 Cor. 10.
16, 17. The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the
blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body
of Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one body; for we are all
partakers of that one bread. To explain this briefly, It is called the cup of
blessing, or of giving thanks, because it is received to this end, that we
should give thanks to Christ for His death and passion for us: or that we
should use it so, as to put us in mind of Christ's benefits toward us, and for
these to give Him thanks.

Communion of the blood of Christ: Communion is a participation of a common
thing: the Communion of the body and blood of Christ is by faith to be made
partakers of Christ and all His benefits, the same Spirit being in us which is
in Christ, and working the same thing in us which he does in Christ.

It is a spiritual communion which believers have with Christ, as members with
the head, and as branches with the vine.

For the Bread and Wine are the Communion, that is the sign and testimony of
our Communion with Christ.

This Communion (as the Apostle there said) consists in this, that we being
many are one body.

This makes against the corporal eating of the Papists in this Sacrament, for
our communion with Christ is only by faith and by the Holy Ghost.

Christ is the common head, His benefits are common, and communicated to all
His members: Hence also it follows that the members are common among
themselves, whence should flow mutual love and amity.

The Papists to uphold their Transubstantiation do say, that we must take the
words literally, and so immediately after the words of consecration at the
last syllable of the last word, that the Bread is transubstantiated or changed
into the very body of Christ, and the Wine into His blood.

But this is a Sacramental speech of Christ, This is my body. As St. Austin to
that general rule about Sacramental actions, adds this instance of eating the
body of Christ. This is a certain way (said he) of finding out whether such a
phrase or speech be proper or figurative, that whatsoever in Divine Word or
holy Scriptures, cannot be done by honest and good manners, nor be properly
referred to the truth of our faith, we must know it to be a figurative speech.
And shortly after instances in that place, Unless ye eat the flesh of the Son
of man, Joh. 6. 53.
and drink His blood, ye have no life in you. Does our Savior here command
such a nefarious act, to have the Jews fall upon Him, kill and ^ley Him, to eat
His flesh, and drink His blood? No; it is a figurative speech, there Christ
commands* them to communicate with the passion and sufferings of the Lord, and
most sweetly to lay it up in remembrance, that for us His body and flesh was
crucified and wounded.

So also this is a figurative speech, when our Savior speaks of the Bread,
This is my body; and of the Cup, This is my blood. This Cup is the New
Testament in My blood: where the name of the thing signified, by a Sacramental
Metonymie is given to the sign.

So the words of Christ must be understood Sacramentally, the Bread is called
the body of Christ, because it is the sign of the body of Christ: and the Cup,
or the Wine in the Cup, is called the blood of Christ, because it is the sign
of the blood of Christ. And the Cup is called the New Testament because it is
the sign of the New Testament.

So the true sense and meaning of Christ's words, This is my body which is
given for you, is thus, This Bread which is broken by Me and given to you, is a
sign of My body which is given to death for you, and is a certain sign of your
conjunction and union with Me: so that he that believes and eats this bread,
he does truly feed on My body.

But according to that impious fiction of the Popish transubstantiation, many
absurdities follow. As,

1. Christ brake bread, not His body; therefore the bread is not really the
body of Christ.

2. The body of Christ is given for us, and not bread; therefore bread is not
really the body of Christ.

3. Christ did not say, under these species is My body, or My body is contained
under these species; therefore Papists pervert Christ's words, and keep not to
the institution.

4. Christ said not of bread, let this be made My body, but this is My body.

5. Notwithstanding their transubstantiation, the bread is neither annihilated,
nor changed into the substance of a body, but remains bread still.

6. In every Sacrament there are two things, the sign and the thing signified:
but transubstantiation takes away the sign, namely Bread and Wine; therefore
it does wholly overthrow the Sacrament.

7. Transubstantiation takes away the analogy between the sign and the thing
signified.

But no more of this; I will only add four Reasons against the carnal or
corporal presence of Christ in the Sacrament.

etc.

Romans 4. 11.
Sacrament.





There is another gross error also of Consubstantiation:

Consubstantiation is a coexistency of two substances in the same place: or the
presence of the body and blood of Christ, not under the species of Bread and
Wine, but under the very Bread and Wine. Luther was of this opinion, that it
remained bread still; but under, in, or with the bread is the body of Christ.

And this is the common tenent and opinion of those who this day are called
Lutherans.

Against this, these few reasons may suffice.

1. The whole action of the Lord's Supper is done in remembrance of Christ,
what need have we of that, if Christ's body were really present, either under,
with, or in the elements?

2. Christ's body is in Heaven: and the Heavens must receive Him, until the
times of restitution of all things, Acts 3. 21.

3. This is an essential property of every magnitude (and therefore of Christ's
body also) to be in one place, and circumscribed or encompassed of one place.

4. If Christ's body were eaten corporally, then the wicked as well as the
Godly partake of the flesh of Christ: but to eat His flesh is to believe in
Him, and to have eternal life.

5. It is absurd to think that Christ sitting with His disciples, did with His
own hands take His own body, and give it wholly to every one of His Disciples.

This is the Sacrament not of the living, or of the glorious body of Christ,
but of His suffering and crucified body.

So Christ said, This is My body which is given for you: it is the Sacrament of
Christ's body delivered unto death for us. And that these two ways.

1. It is a visible sign, bringing to our remembrance, or representing to us
the body of Christ; that as with our bodily eyes we see the bread of the Lord
so with the eyes of our Soul we may see Christ's body crucified for us.

2. It is a seal, sealing to our faith that Christ's body was certainly
delivered to death for us, and is become the bread of life unto us.

We must not therefore seek Christ's body in the earthly element, but by faith
lift up our hearts to Heaven, whither Christ ascended* and where He is. So in
our Liturgy at the celebration of this Supper, we are admonished to lift up our
hearts.

Now let us come to speak of the outward actions both of the Minister, and also
of the Receivers.

1. The actions of the Minister are these four.

1. To take the Bread and Wine into his hands, and to separate it from ordinary
Bread and Wine. Which is to signify to us, that God in His eternal decree
separated Christ to be our Mediator, and that He was set apart for this office:
Him has God the Father sealed.

2. To bless and consecrate the Bread and Wine, by the Word and Prayer. Which
signifies to us, that God in His due time sent Christ into the world, and
sanctified Him, furnishing Him with all gifts needful for a Mediator.

3. To break the Bread and pour out the Wine. Which signifies, the passions and
sufferings of Christ, with all the torments which He endured both in soul and
body for our sins.

4. To give and distribute the Bread and Wine to the receivers: which
signifies, that God gave Christ, and that Christ gave Himself to us: and that
whole Christ and all His merits are freely offered to all sorts of receivers.
And that God has given Christ to the faithful receivers to feed their souls
unto eternal life, Joh. 3. 14, 15. Joh. 6. 50, 51.

2. Next we come to the Sacramental actions of the receivers, and they are
these two.

1. To take the Bread and Wine offered by the Minister, every one into his or
her hand. This signifies, his taking, and laying hold of Christ freely offered
from God the Father, by the hand of faith, Joh. 1. 12. Or, the receiving of
Christ with all His benefits into his soul by faith.

They, and they only have benefit by Christ crucified, which thus apply Christ
to themselves by a true and lively faith* To as many as thus receive Him, to
them gives He power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on His
name.

2. To eat the Bread, and drink the Wine, receiving them into the body* and
digesting them. And this signifies our uniting to Christ, and enjoying of 1
Cor. 11. 26.
Him; or our application of Christ by faith, that the feeling of our true union
and communion with Christ may be increased.

We must with delight apply Christ and His merits, to all the necessities of
our Souls; spiritually feeding upon Him, and growing by Him.

For the eating of the Bread to strengthen our nature, betokens the inward
strengthening of our souls by Grace, through the merit of breaking Christ's body
for us. And the drinking of the Wine to cherish our bodies, betokens that the
blood of Christ shed on the Cross, and (as it were) drunk by faith, does
cherish our souls.

And as God does bless these outward elements to preserve and strengthen the
body of the receiver; so Christ apprehended and received by faith, does nourish
him, and preserve him both body Joh. 6. 50, 51.
and soul unto eternal life, 1 Cor. 10. 3. 11. 17, 19.

Q. Who are to be admitted to be partakers of this Sacrament?

A. 1. They who are of years of discretion, and sound judgment, able to discern
the Lord's body, ought to repair to it. If they are able to prove and examine
themselves, and rightly to remember the Lord's death. For so is the
Commandment, This do in remembrance of me: And let a man examine himself, and
so let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup: for so ye show the Lords
death till He come, 1 Cor. 11. 27, 28.

2. They who are baptized, and by Baptism made members of the Church. For our
Covenant with God made in Baptism, is renewed in the Lord's Supper.

As formerly none might eat of the Passover unless he were circumcised; so
none may partake at the Lord's table unless baptized.

3. Who in word and deed profess their faith and repentance; or who express the
profession of their faith and repentance, by the actions of their life. For of
occult and hidden things the Church judges not: but she admits all those
whom she can judge to be members of Christ: that is, those whom she hears and
sees by their confession and by their outward deeds to profess their faith and
repentance; whether they be Godly, or whether they be Hypocrites not yet made
manifest.

Q. What is to be performed of every Christian that he may partake worthily of
the Lords Supper?

A. Three things.

1. A due preparation before receiving.

2. Great heed in the whole duty of receiving.

3. A thankful close and shutting up of it. Of all these in order.

Q. What is the preparation requisite to this holy Sacrament?

A. Duly to search and examine their own souls, if they can find in themselves
those things which God requires in worthy Communicants.

This preparation is twofold: 1. Inward. 2. Outward.

1. Inward, which is spiritual, and that consists in a man's examining of
himself, and so to try his own worthiness: There is a double worthiness.

1. A Worthiness of the person; if thou have faith, and the righteousness of
Christ imputed by faith to thee.

2. A worthiness of the using; which is true reverence inward and outward;
forgiveness, love, a serious bewailing of sins, and repentance; the meditation
of the benefits of Christ; the discerning the body of the Lord, thanksgiving;
and the avoiding of all offenses. All these things be particularly discussed by
many worthy writers, and therefore I here wave them. Briefly thus,

Such as will in a holy sort prepare themselves to celebrate the Lord's Supper,
must have,

1. A knowledge of God, of Man's fall, and of the promised restoration into the
Covenant by Christ.

2. True faith in Christ: for every man receives so much as he believes, Heb.
4. 2.

3. True repentance of all their sins past, Isai. 66. 3. Psalm. 26. 6.

4. Perfect love and charity: forgiving as we would be forgiven: true
repentance purges out malice among all other sins; and a sound faith works
by love, toward God, and toward our brethren also, Mat. 5. 22. Jam. 1. 19.
20. Gal. 5. 6.

The holy Apostle Paul (in 1 Cor. 11. 27, 28, 29.) places preparation in these
three acts. 1. Discerning the Lord's body. 2. Examining of our selves. 3. A
worthy disposition. To speak a little of all these distinctly.

1. Discerning the Lord's body; which consists in a good understanding and
judgment of the nature, use, and necessity of the Sacrament. Now because these
things cannot be understood but out of the fundamentals of Christian Religion,
about sin, and misery following thence; the Grace of Christ, and the blessings
therehence slowing: of our duty in thankfulness and obedience to God; therefore
the knowledge of the principal points of Christian Religion which are necessary
to Salvation, are needfully required to this discerning here spoken of.

2. Examining our selves; which consists in a serious trial if we are so
disposed, that we may use this Sacrament with profit.

The rule of this examination is the Word of God, especially as it concerns the
institution of this Sacrament.

Our dispositions to be looked into in this trial of our selves, are our faith,
repentance, charity, a desire of new obedience.

3. A worthy disposition; which consists in an agreeableness of our affections
with this sacred business.

And here is required,

1. That we renew our repentance, as for all our former sins, so especially our
late failings, and for those sins we are most inclined unto, and those
committed since our last receiving.

2. To stir up in our selves a hungring and thirsting after Christ and His
Grace, as for pardoning and mortifying our sins, so to be enabled for better
obedience, and newness of life.

3. To stir up our faith to lay hold on the promises of the Gospel.

4. That with all humility, reverence, and devotion, we receive this Sacrament,
as the Seal of the Covenant of Grace, and of the promises of God.

Thus far of the first part to be performed by every Christian worthily to
partake of the Lord's Supper, which is Preparation. Now for the second,
Heedfulness in the duty of receiving. And that consists in these four things.

1. Reverendly to attend, the better to apply the whole action; joining with
the Minister in his Prayers, making use of all the Sacramental actions both in
the Minister, and also in the receivers, whereof we spoke at large before, and
so thankfully commemorating the Lord's death, for the comfort and refreshing of
our souls.

2. According as it is commanded, all must take the Bread and Wine into their
hands.

3. According to Christ's command, to eat that Bread, and drink that Wine.

4. They must use thanksgiving, offering up themselves both souls and bodies is
a Sacrifice of thanksgiving. In which Romans 12. 1*
respect this Sacrament is properly called the Eucharist. As often as we eat this
bread, and drink this cup, we show the Lords death, etc. The Ordinance it self
is full of death: what other language does bread broken, and the blood severed
from the body speak, but a dying Christ? As the Ordinance, so the Communicant
does by eating and drinking, in fact declare his profession of adherence to
Christ, and embracing of the death of Christ for remission of Sins, and
reconciliation of his person unto God. Which although at all times we may and
should remember, yet God would have a solemn standing Ordinance in His Church,
for the commemoration and showing of it forth; which Ordinance is this of the
Lord's Supper.

This must be our actual exercise at the time of our eating and drinking at
this Holy Table, to show forth the Lord's death. The death of Christ then must
fill our eyes, ears, lips, and thoughts; If any of us could see Christ dying,
that sight would take us up. Here we come as near to see Him dying, as can be
represented unto us: Here Christ is Crucified before our eyes. Thus much Gal.
3. 1.
for the second part, which is a Christian heedfulness in the act of receiving.
Now of the third and last part, a thankful close and shutting up this our duty
in this Ordinance.

1. By joyful thanksgiving, with Prayers.

2. Meditation how we are bettered; what increase we find of our faith in
Christ, love to God and all His Saints, what strength and power we have gotten
against sin, lust, and corruption; what new obedience we show forth in our
lives; and what increase and confi^ming we find of all other sanctifying and
saving Graces in us; to help us to lead new lives, and to run the ways of all
God's Commandments with more strength and alacrity than formerly.

This do in remembrance of me:

This is a solemn Memorial instituted by Christ Himself. Great Deliverances or
Mercies have solemn commemorations: Such was the Passover, and the Feast of
Purim, etc. among the Jews. Christ did not ordain it for His Nativity,
Circumcision, Ascension, etc. (though all these were for us and our Redemption)
but in remembrance of His death: hereby we show the Lord's death. Because our
sins are done away by His death; therein (in His death) was made the Sacrifice
of atonement; Redemption and Reconciliation was made thereby, the Covenant
confirmed, the justice of God satisfied, and everlasting life procured, etc.

1. Let us make this thankful remembrance to and within our selves, what fruit
and benefit we receive from Christ, and the torments and pains He endured for
us both in His blessed body and soul; nay His Soul-pains were the sole or chief
of all His pains. Do not these deserve a thankful remembrance?

2. We make this remembrance to others, to all the world, by our solemn
profession of Christ and His death, to which we stick, for remission of sins,
and acceptance with God.

3. We make this remembrance to God, that Christ by His death has satisfied
God's justice, and has made peace through the blood of His Cross. Who shall
therefore lay any thing to the Col. 1. 20.
charge of Gods elect? it is Christ that dyed for us, etc. Romans 8. 34.

I close up with the Allegory of the Paschal Lamb and Christ, how the type and
antitype or the thing signified fitly answer and agree; in these thirteen
things.

1. It must be a lamb of the flock; so Christ was true man, Joh. 1. 14.

2. A Lamb without blemish; so Christ was without sin.

3. To be killed and roasted with fire; to show the bitter death and passion of
Christ.

4. A bone of it must not be broken; so Christ had not a bone broken, Joh. 19.
36.

5. It must be in the evening; so Christ suffered in the end of the world, Heb.
1. 2. and 9. 26.

6. The posts were to be sprinkled with the blood; so Christ's blood is
sprinkled on our Consciences, and His satisfaction is imputed to us, Romans 3.
Isai. 53. 6.

7. Seeing the blood, the destroying Angel passed over, and they were preserved
from death; so Christ by his blood frees us from everlasting death.

8. The Lamb was to be eaten, and in every family; so Christ by faith is to be
applied by every believer.

9. The Lamb was to be roasted whole, his head, legs and appurtenances; so
whole Christ is to be received, and wholly according to all the articles of our
faith, 2 Timothy 3. 7.

10. Without leaven: that is without hypocrisy.

11. It must be eaten with bitter herbs: with true repentance and bitter grief
for sin which caused that bitter passion of Christ. He that will be Christ's
Disciple, must take up the Cross.

12. It must be eaten hastily, and with their staves in their hands, after the
fashion of strangers: to show that we are Pilgrims here, and travailing to our
heavenly country have need of such a Viaticum in the way.

13. Only Circumcised to eat thereof. So only the regenerate feed on Christ by
faith; and Christ is profitable only unto them.

Some Sentences.
1. Our Union and Communion with Christ does not mingle the persons, nor unite
the substances; but it consociates our affections, and confederates our wills.

2. This is to eat that bread, and drink that cup, to abide in Christ, and to
have Christ abiding in thee. And hereby it follows, that he that abides not in
Christ, nor Christ in him, does not spiritually eat of this bread and drink of
this cup; although carnally and visibly he eats of the Sacrament of the body
and blood of Christ.

3. To believe in Christ is to eat that bread of life: He that believes in
Christ feeds upon Him; and is invisibly fatted by Him, because he is
invisibly regenerated.

4. Believers only eat the bread the Lord; wicked men who are against Christ in
their practices may eat the bread of the Lord.

5. All Glory to God, and Salvation to Men, is placed in the death and passion
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

EXERCITATION THE FOURTH.
Ecclesiastes 12. 13. Fear God: The whole Verse runs thus, Let us hear the
conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep His Commandments: for this
is the whole duty of Man.
THe meaning is thus, as if King Solomon had said, the whole subject of this
Book of Ecclesiastes, is summarily comprehended in this point, that man should
lead his life in the fear of God, and in holy obedience unto Him: So that after
this life he may enjoy everlasting blessedness and happiness in Him.

Now the fear of God is commanded in the first Commandment; the scope and
meaning of the first Commandment is thus; that Jehovah, one in Substance and
three in Persons, the Creator and Governor of all things, and the Redeemer of
His people, is to be entertained for the only true God, in all the powers of
our soul. And that the inward Mat. 22. 37. Prove. 23. 26. Deuteronomy. 5. 29. Prove. 4.
23. Mat. 12. 35.
and spiritual worship of the heart, (wherein God especially delights, and
which is the ground of the outward worship,) may be given to Him, and none
other: and that sincerely without hypocrisy, as in His sight who searches
Jer. 17. 10.
and knows the heart.

For this word before Me, or before My face, notes that inward entertainment
and worship whereof God alone does take notice. And thereby God shows, that
He condemns as well the corrupt thoughts of man's heart concerning His
Majesty, as the wicked practice of the body; for our thoughts are before His
face.

The easiest way of explaining or understanding the Commandments, is by
dividing the obedience due to every Commandment, into its proper virtues as
parts; and then the vices contrary to those virtues will easily appear.

As there are these seven virtues or parts of obedience due to the first
Commandment. 1. The acknowledging of God. 2. Faith in God. 3. Hope. 4. Love of
God. 5. Fear of God. 6. Humility. 7. Patience.

But here we are to speak only of the fear of God. The true fear of God, is to
acknowledge the extreme anger of God against sin, and His power to punish it;
and to esteem our displeasing of God or offending Him, and consequently an
estrangedness from Him, as the greatest evil: and therefore extremely to hate
and detest sin; and to be ready rather to suffer any evil, than to offend in
any thing.

Or thus, The fear of God, is from acknowledging of His Wisdom, Power, Justice,
and Right which He has over all creatures, and out of subjection unto Him, not
willing to offend Him. Levit. 19. 14.
Thou shall fear thy God; I am the Lord.

God is feared, as He is just and powerful to punish; in regard of the evil of
punishment, which He can inflict. So we stand in such a Godly fear, as not to
do any thing, but that which makes for God's glory: and yet this is not a
servile fear (whereby one is afraid to be damned) but an awful filial fear,
whereby we are afraid, to offend our Maker and Heavenly Father. So our Savior
bids Mat. 10. 28.
us, rather fear Him that is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. So St.
Peter bids us to pass the time of our sojourning 1 Pet. 1. 17.
here in fear. Let us have grace whereby Heb. 12. 28.
we may serve God acceptably with reverence and Godly fear. For as a Father
pityeth his Son, so the Lord pityeth them that fear Him. Whereas all carnal
fear, and especially the fearing of any thing more than God, is here condemned.
Fear ye not their fear, neither be afraid; Isai. 8. 12, 13.
but sanctify the Lord of Hosts Himself, and let Him be your fear, and let Him
be your dread. I, even I, am He (says the 51. 12, 13.
Lord) that comfort you; who art thou that thou should be afraid of a man
that shall dye, and of the Son of man, that shall be made as grass? and
forgettest the Lord thy maker, etc. and have feared continually every day,
because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy, and
where is the fury of the oppressor?

Fear not them which kill the body, but Mat. 10. 28.
are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear Him that is able to destroy
both soul and body in hell.

We should be more afraid to displease God than any other: and this fear of God
should be stronger to move us to do good, than the fear of man to move us to do
evil.

There is a twofold fear of God. 1. Filial. 2. Slavish.

1. Filial, which is from acknowledging of sin, and the anger of God against
it, and from a serious grief for sins committed, because of offending God
thereby, and in regard of calamities that we and others endure for sin, and a
fear of future sins and punishments; with an ardent desire of avoiding those
evils, through the acknowledging of God's mercy showed to us in and through
Christ.

This is usually called filial fear, because it is such a fear as dutiful
Children have toward their Father, grieving for the anger and displeasure of
their father, and fearing least they should offend him again, and so be
punished for it; and yet are always persuaded of their fathers love and
good will toward them, and therefore love him, and through this love do grieve
the more because they have offended him. So we read of Peter, that when he had
denied his Master, he went forth, and wept bitterly. Mat. 26. 75.


But servile and slavish fear, is such as of Servants to their Masters, to
avoid punishment, without faith, and without a desire and striving to amend:
and is usually joined with despair, and a withdrawing from God, and fleeing
away from Him.

Filial and slavish fear differ in these three things.

1. Filial fear proceeds from our trust and confidence in God, and love to
Him. But servile fear arises from a sight of sin, and sins flying in the face,
with the sense of judgment, and of the wrath of God.

2. Filial fear principally turns away from sin which displeases God, but not
from God Himself. But servile fear is a fleeing from, and a hatred not of sin,
but of punishments and judgments of God; and so at length with a fleeing from,
and a hatred of God Himself.

3. Filial fear is joined with some assurance of salvation and everlasting
life, and so draws us nearer to God. But a servile fear is joined with an
expectation of everlasting damnation and casting away from God, and so drives
farther from Him: which is so much the more in them, as their doubting or
despair of the Grace and Mercy of God is more or less.

This slavish fear is in the Devils and wicked men, and is the beginning of
everlasting death, which the wicked and ungodly do feel even in this life. So
said Cain to God, My punishment is Genesis 4. 14.
greater than I can bear: Behold, Thou have driven me out this day from the
face of the earth; and from thy face I shall be hid, and I shall be a fugitive,
a vagabond in the earth, etc. So Ahaz, his heart Isai. 7. 2.
was moved, and the hearts of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved
with the wind. And so Saul, he was afraid, 1 Samuel 28. 5.
and his heart greatly trembled. The Jam. 2. 19.
Devils believe and tremble.

There are some things do oppose and resist the fear of God, in defect; and
some in excess.

1. In excess, as servile fear and despair; of which we spoke something before.

2. In defect; as, 1. Profaneness; 2. Carnal security; 3. Contempt of God; 4.
An Idolatrous fear.

The wicked are utterly devoyd of all fear and reverence of God; they have
Psalm. 36. 1.
no fear of God before their eyes: an idolatrous fear, is not that fear alone
which is from idols; as the poor Heathen Indians worship the Devil because he
should not hurt them; but that fear also which is from men and from the world,
when a man fears them more than he fears God.

Some carnal security may be in the Godly, yet it is otherwise with them than
in the wicked. It is so in the Godly, that the fear of God is not altogether
cast out of their heart; but the 1 King. 14. 9.
wicked like Jeroboam cast God behind their back: So God complains of the Ezekiel.
33. 35.
Jews, they had forgotten Him, and cast him behind their back: and that they
had cast away the Law; There is no fear Isai. 5. 24. Psalm. 36. 1.
of God before their eyes. Like the unjust Judge, who neither feared God, nor
regarded man. We may have cause to Luke 18. 2.
fear such; as Abraham said of the Philistines at Gerar, Because I thought that
Genesis 20: 11. 1 Samuel 21. 10: and 23. 26.
the fear of God is not in this place, and they will slay me for my wifes sake.
So David fled for fear of Saul.

There are many acceptations of fear in Scripture.

1. It is taken for natural fear, which is a certain natural affection, whereby
men are stricken by reason of some natural or hurtful evil, either true or
imagined. So Jacob said of his brother Genesis 32. 11.
Esau, I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mothers with the
children. So the City of Jericho feared because of Israel. So Peter being on
the Josh. 2. 9, 11. Mat. 14. 30. and 28. 4.
Sea, when he saw the wind boisterous, was afraid, and cried out, etc. This
natural fear is in it self neither good nor evil. It was in Christ Himself, as
He was man. It becomes evil and sinful Heb. 5. 7. Mark 14. 33.
when distrust is mixed with it.

2. There is a free voluntary fear and reverence, which inferiors show to
their superiors, making them careful to obey, and loath to offend, and that for
the Lord's sake. Let the wise see Ephesians. 5. 33.
that she reverence her husband; but the word in the Original is ((...)) that
she fear her husband. So, render to all their due; fear to whom fear Romans 13. ^.
belongs.

3. Fear sometimes in Scripture is taken for the thing or danger feared: the
thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, said Job, and that which I was
Job. 3. 25. Prove. 1. 27.
afraid of is come unto me. When their fear comes as desolation, etc. that is,
when that which they feared comes, etc.

4. For the person which is feared. In this sense God is called the fear of
Isaac: So Jacob swear by the fear of his father Isaac, that is, by God whom
Isaac Genesis 31. 42, 53.
feared; a Metonymie.

5. Fear in Scripture sometime is taken for, an holy affection of the heart
awing us, and making us loath to displease God by sin, in respect of His great
goodness and mercies, and for a love we bear to righteousness. There is mercy
Psalm. 130. 4.
with Thee, that Thou may be feared: This is a filial or child-like fear,
spoken of before. The Godly are commanded Job 1. 2. Acts 10. 2.
thus to fear, and are commended for it; so is Job, and so Cornelius, that they
feared God.

6. For a terror in the heart of wicked men, fearing God as a Judge; being
loath to offend Him by sin in regard of His punishments, and not from any hatred
of wickedness. Thus Felix trembled Acts 24. 25.
and feared. This is servile and slavish fear, spoken of also before.

7. Fear is taken for the whole worship of God. Thou shall fear the Lord. In
every nation he that fears God, and Deuteronomy. 6. 13. Acts 10. 35. Prove. 1. 7.
Psalm. 112. 1. and 128. 1.
works righteousness, is accepted of Him. Blessed is every one that fears
the Lord; where is a Synechdoche of the part for the whole. For where the fear
of God is truly planted, there will follow the whole worship of God.

8. To think upon dangerous things which breed fear. So thine heart shall Isai.
33. 18.
meditate fear.

9. For a great terror, and fear from God; which was sent on the hearts of the
men of those Cities of the Canaanites, that they pursued not after the sons of
Genesis 35. 5.
Jacob to slay them. And the fear of 2 Chr. 17. 10.
God was upon those cities round about them, etc.

Thus we see the several significations, and acceptations of fear in Scripture:
and also what the true fear of God is; which is, whereby we so fear and
reverence His holy Majesty and His Word, that we take heed by all means, of
offending so gracious a Father, not so much for fear of punishment, as out of
true love to God.

Several encouragements out of Scripture, to fear God. 1. God wishes it, Oh
that they would fear Me, that it may be Deuteronomy. 5. 29.
well with them, and with their children! and for their good always. and 6. 24.


2. The secret of the Lord is with them Psalm. 25. 14.
that fear Him; and He will show them His Covenant. He will teach them. and
119. 102.


3. There is no want to them that fear Him: The young lions shall lack and
Psalm. 34. 9, 10.
suffer hunger, but they that fear the Lord, shall lack no good thing. and 33.
18, 19. Prove. 22. 4.


By humility and the fear of the Lord, are riches, honor, and life. There is
Psalm 11 1. 5. and 112. 1, 2. Prove. 15. 16. Psalm. 61. 5.
a special heritage belongs to those that fear God; therefore David said, Thou
have given me the heritage of those that fear Thy name: That is, as these
present* so also eternal good things, which properly belong to God's Children;
wherein they of the world have no part at all.

4. The Lord is nigh them that fear Psalm. 85. 9.
Him. And blessed are they to whom the Lord is nigh to hear and help. Moses
described the happiness of Israel herein, and said, What nation is there so
great, Deuteronomy. 4. 7.
who has the Lord so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is to us, in all
things that we call upon Him for?

Surely His salvation is nigh them that Psalm. 85. 9.
fear Him, etc.

In the fear of the Lord is strong considence; Prove. 14. 26.

He will fulfill the desire of them that and 145. 19.

has no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon His God.

In every nation he that fears God, Act. 10. 35.
and works righteousness is accepted of him.

To whomsoever fears God, the word and 13. 26.
of salvation is sent.

ENCOMIUMS, or Praises of the fear of God.
Behold, the fear of the Lord that is Job 28. 28.
wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding.

The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring Psalm. 19. 9.
for ever: That is, the rule of His fear, and of all true Religion contained in
His Word, is pure and clean; and it cleanses and purifieth us; it is
invariable and incorruptible, and produces the effect of eternal life in them
that observe it.

The fear of the Lord is the beginning Psalm. 111. 10.
of wisdom: that is, the fear of the Lord is the foundation as well as
beginning of wisdom.

The Lord takes pleasure in them that and 147. 11.

The fear of the Lord is the beginning Prove. 1. 7.

that is, he that has the true knowledge and fear of God in his heart, it will
make him hate sin, which is so hateful unto God.

The fear of the Lord is a fountain of and 14. 27.
life, to depart from the snares of death.

The fear of the Lord is the instruction and 15. 33.
of wisdom: that is, the fear of the Lord is the best and only means to have
our hearts framed to receive true wisdom.

By the fear of the Lord men depart and 16. 6.
from evil: that is, they that truly fear God, will not willingly run into sin;
but say with Joseph, How can I do this wickedness, Genesis 39. 9.
and sin against God? And this fear of God, was a curb to Joseph, when he dealt
roughly with his brethren; when he had cast them into Prison, on the third day
he brought them Gen: 42. 18.
out; and said, this do, and live; for I fear God. So let this fear of God be
always before our eyes, as a spur to every good duty, and a bar against all sin
and wickedness.

Happy is the man that fears always: Prove. 28. 14.
that is, through the awful respect he has to God's glorious Majesty fearing
to offend Him; and being no ways confident of himself, that does so always and
at all times, it is a special preservative against sin; and so, happy is that
man.

A man or woman that so fears the Prove. 31. 30.
Lord, shall be praised. God is greatly to Psalm. 89. 7.

God is to be feared above all gods. and 96. 4.


Let us therefore strive as good Obadiah though in the Court of wicked Ahab) to
fear the Lord from our youth, 1 King. 18. 3, 12.
and to fear Him greatly. And as Cornelius that religious Captain, who feared
Acts 10. 2.
God with all his house: to be faithful Nehem. 7. 2.
men, and to fear God above many. Passing the time of our sojourning here in 1
Pet. 1. 17.
fear; in carefulness to please God, fearing lest we should offend Him.

Surely I know, that it shall be well with Eccles. 8. 12.
them, that fear God, which fear before Him.

David could not express it but breaks Psalm. 31. 19.
out in admiration of it; Oh how great is Thy goodness* which Thou have laid up
for them that fear Thee: which Thou have wrought for them that trust in Thee
before the sons of men?

Let us therefore sanctify the Lord of Isai. 8. 13.
hosts Himself, and let Him be our fear, and let Him be our dread.

Wh^ shall not fear Thee, O Lord, and Rev. 15. 4.
glorify Thy name? for Thou only art holy* for all nations shall come and
worship before Thee, for Thy judgments are made manifest.

Q. But what fear may Saints have in the Service of God?

A. 1. There may be a fear of God's wrath: they may have apprehensions of Psalm.
6. 2, 3.
God's heavy displeasure; the hot displeasure of God's wrath may even vex their
bones, and cause their soul to be sore vexed. They may conceive themselves
Psalm. 13. 1.
forgotten of God, and that God does hide His face from them: to have their
soul pained within them, and horror to overwhelm them; and think and 55. 4, 5.
Cant. 5. 6.
that Christ may withdraw Himself and be gone; in regard of any comfortable
and sensible enjoyment of His fellowship which they have.

2. There may be a great fear, even of performing holy Duties: they may be
startled, and not dare adventure upon such holy performances, without much
shame of Spirit and holy reluctance; as Ezra said, I am ashamed and blush to
Ezra 9. 6.
lift up my face to Thee, O my God* for our iniquities are incre^sed over our
heads, and our trespass is grown up unto the h^^vens. And with the poor woman
Mark. 5. 33.
in the Gospel, who came fearing and trembling, and fell down before Christ.
And yet the Saints never depart or fall away from that assured confidence they
have conceived of the mercies of God, though they have a continual strife with
their own distrustfulness.

In all these assaults faith upholds the Godly, and is like to a Palm Tree,
endeavoring to rise up against all burdens, how great soever they may be.

He that striving with his own weakness, resorts to faith in his troubles, is
already in a manner a Conqueror.

So David checks his own heart, Why art thou cast down O my soul? Why art thou
thus disquieted within me? hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him, Psalm.
42. 11.
who is the health of my countenance, and my God. And wait on the Lord; be of
and 27. 14.
good courage, and He shall strengthen and 39. 2.
thine heart; (and so he iterates it) wait I say on the Lord.

Sometimes the Saints may become even dumb with silence, as though their faith
were utterly overthrown, yet they faint not, but proceed in the Battle, and by
Faith and Prayer do still encourage themselves in God; who at length will come
in with the saving strength of His own right hand. Psalm. 20. 6.


There is great difference between the fears of the Godly and of the wicked.

The fear of the wicked arises out of the evidences of the guilt of sin: but
the fear of the Godly from a tender apprehension of the greatness, goodness,
holiness and Majesty of God, and His most pure eyes which cannot endure Habb.
1. 13.
to behold iniquity but with indignation; and out of a deep sense of their own
vileness and unworthiness to meddle with holy things. But yet this fear in the
Saints never brings any dislike or hatred of God, or any wilful disobedience
against Him. For as the fear of the soul deters, so the necessity of the
precept drives on to an endeavor of obedience and well-pleasing.

Slavish fear forces a man to do the duty some way or other, without any
regard to the manner of doing of it. There is also another branch of a holy
filial fear, when we thinking on the examples of God's vengeance showed on
wicked men for their sins, do take care not to fall into the same sins, lest we
have the same punishments: and so crave aid and assistance of God against them,
depending upon His Grace and assistance by His Spirit. For we are of the same
flesh and blood as they were, and bear about us a body of sin. So said the
Apostle, These things were our 1 Cor. 10. 6. to 12.
examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also
lusted. Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them, etc. Neither let us
commit fornication, etc. Neither let us tempt Christ, etc. Neither murmur, as
some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. Now all these
things happened to them for ensamples and were written for our admonition etc.
Wherefore let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall.

Therefore we are bid to work out our Phil. 2. 12.
own salvation with fear and trembling. Seeing our own weakness, wretchedness,
and sinfulness, to lie low in our own sight, and to look up unto and rest upon
the Almighty Power and Grace of God.

Nothing so much awakens us to cast all our confidence upon God, and by faith
to rely upon Him, as to have a distrust of our selves, seeing our own weakness
and frailty.

And when we thus go out of our selves, resting wholly upon God, it always goes
best with us. Ephraim was Hos^^ 1^ 1.
heard in that he ^eared. Therefore Solomon said, happy is the man that fears
always. Prove. 28. 14.
How wretched soever we be of our selves, by faith we know, that through God's
most gracious acceptance of us in Christ, we shall be blessed.

God requires to Himself the reverence both of a Father, and also of a Master.
A son honors his father, and a servant Mal. 1. 6.
his master. If then I be a father, where is mine honor? and if I be a master,
where is my fear, says the Lord of hosts? He that truly worshippeth God, will
endeavor to show himself both a dutiful Son, and an obedient Servant unto Him.

Therefore let the fear of God be a reverence joined with honor.

Q. But how shall we answer that place, there is no fear in love; but perfect
love casts out fear: because fear 1 John 4. 18.
has torment; he that fears is not made perfect in love.

A. The wicked fear not displeasing God, so that they may do it without
punishment: but because they do know God is armed with power to revenge,
therefore they tremble and fear, apprehending His wrath and vengeance. But the
Godly fear to displease and offend God, more than they fear the punishments.
And therefore they are the more careful, wary, and watchful.

The fear which the Apostle John there speaks of, is slavish fear. There is no
such slavish fear in love; but perfect love casts out that fear: that is, our
true, lively and sincere love to God, carries it self no longer toward God,
with a simple fear of His terrible Majesty and Judgments; but with a sweet,
humble, and reverend apprehension of His Grace and goodness, by which He has
made and declared Himself most amiable and lovely to the soul; whereby is
begotten hope and confidence in Him.

Q. How may we understand that place, Ye have not received the spirit of Romans
8. 15.
bondage, again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby
we cry Abba, Father.

A. There is a threefold operation of the Holy Ghost in those that are led by
Him.

1. He is unto them a Spirit of bondage, working fear.

2. He is a Spirit of adoption, working love, through the sense of God's mercy:
for He not only makes them the Sons of God, but intimates to their Spirits
God's love toward them, that they are His Sons.

3. He is a Spirit of intercession, making Romans 8. 26.
them to go with boldness to the throne of Grace, and call upon God as their
Father. We are now to speak only of the first.

The Godly usually in the first act of Conversion, feel the Spirit casting them
down in the sight of their sins, rebuking them for sin, and convincing them of
sin; letting them see the bondage and servitude under which they lie; that they
are slaves of Satan, and guilty of everlasting damnation, which works in them
great fear. As the proclaiming of the Law wrought in the Children of Exodus 20.
18, 19.
Israel great terror and amazement: So John Baptist began at the Preaching of
Mat. 3. 10.
the Law: and the people asked him, Luke 3. 10.
what shall we do that we may be saved? And yet the Apostle here does not
compare the Godly under the Law, with the Godly under the Gospel: but the Godly
under the Gospel with themselves; their second experience of the operation of
the Spirit in them with the first. Whereas in the first operation He was a
Spirit of bondage, now He is a Spirit of adoption. God is pleased to bring us
by the gates of Hell to Heaven. First deeply to humble us, then to exalt and
comfort us. So then the meaning of these words ( ye have not received the
spirit of bondage again to fear) is thus, Albeit in the time of your first
Conversion you were stricken with a fear of that wrath which is the recompense
of sin; yet now the Spirit of adoption has not only released you of that fear
of damnation, which you conceived at the first, through the sight and sense of
your sins; but also has assured you of Salvation, making you certain that God
is become your Father in Christ Jesus.

All the terrors and fears wherewith God humbles his children at the first,
are but preparatives to his comforts and Consolations, that they may be the
more sweet to the Soul.

In this 15th verse of Romans 8. Two effects of the Spirit are opposed. For in
some the Spirit works fear; in others, love and assurance, and first fear,
then assurance. In all the elect which are of years of discretion, the Spirit
works a slavish fear first, before the filial assurance; fear is the sign of
the Spirit of bondage, confidence and assurance in God as a Father, is the
proper effect of the Spirit of adoption.

So the Jews at Peter's Sermon were Acts 2. 37.
first pricked at the heart, and after comforted in assurance of forgiveness.

All are brought to this exigent, more or less, that they may acknowledge they
stand in need of Christ, and be stirred up to seek out after him.

Such as were never afraid, were never assured. So none have the Spirit of
adoption, but such as have had the Spirit of bondage. Therefore Christ said,
Mat. 9. 12.
the whole have no need of a Physician, etc. As long as men think themselves
well; they will not seek out to a Physician (though then they may have need
enough) but when they are stricken with sickness. The poor sin-sick Soul
grieved and weary with the burden of sin, comes to Christ the great Physician.

Fear God; are the words first read.

Q. But we read that the fearful, etc. Rev. 21. 8.
Shall be cast into the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is
the second death.

A. That is spoken of those that faint in their spiritual combats, who through
carnal fear, shall not dare to make profession of the truth, or shall deny it.

Q. What is that fear of God, which is here commanded?

A. 1. To reverence the Majesty and Power of God; so as the chief reason of our
fear is not any evil that may come to us, but the excellent perfection of God.

2. When we do most especially fear the offending of God, and displeasing Him.

3. When we are affected with fear and trembling by beholding the tokens of
God's displeasure. So Moses said, Psalm. 90. 11.
who knows the power of Thy wrath? according to Thy fear, so is Thy wrath.

Q. What are the special and principal marks of the true fear of God?

A. 1. Seriously to flee from all those things which are evil in the eyes of
God: A wise man fears, and departs from Prove. 14: 16. and 14. 6.
evil. By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.

2. If out of Conscience toward God, we abstain from those sins which are
hidden from the eyes of men, and safe enough in regard of man. Thou shall not
curse the deaf; nor put a stumblingblock Levit. 19. 14.
before the blind; but shall fear thy God; I am the Lord: Now the deaf cannot
hear, and the blind cannot see any injury when it is done unto them; but the
fear of God should deter from it.

So Joseph, though he had the importunities Genesis 39. 9.
of his Mistress, and the opportunity of secrecy, yet the fear of God kept him
from committing Adultery.

3. If we do not only abstain from sins, but also hate them, and that because
God hates them. The fear of the Lord Prove. 8. 13.
is to hate evil.

4. If we are very careful about this thing, that we depart not away from Psalm.
18. 21.
God. As David said, I have kept the laws of the Lord, and have not wickedly
departed from my God.

5. If we strive not only to abstain from evil, but also to do good. Eschew 1
Pet. 3. 11.
evil, and do good; seek peace, and ensue it.

Hold fast that which is good: abstain 1 Thessalonians. 5. 21, 22.
from all appearance of evil.

6. If we fear not men, or any other creature; so as to deter us from doing our
duty. Job, when he would make a protestation of his uprightness, said, Did I
fear a great multitude, or did the Job. 31. 34.
contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, etc? But and if ye
suffer for righteousness sake, happy are ye; and 1 Pet. 3. 14, 15.
be not afraid of their terror, neither be ye troubled: but sanctify the Lord
God in your hearts, etc.

7. If we use the Name of God, and all His holy attributes, not lightly, but
with great reverence; These things show that we truly fear God. Thou shall
always fear this glorious and fearful Deuteronomy. 28. 58.
name, The Lord thy God.

Q. What are the arguments to induce us to the fear of God?

A. 1. His Almightiness. Fear ye not Jer. 5. 22.
Me, says the Lord? will ye not tremble at My presence? which have placed the
sand for the bound of thy sea, etc. Touching Job 37. 23, 24.
the Almighty, we cannot find Him out; He is excellent in power, and in
judgment, and in plenty of justice, etc. Men do therefore fear Him, etc.

2. Because of His Kingdom. The Lord reigns; let the earth tremble. Who Psalm.
99. 1. Jer. 10. 7.
would not fear Thee, O King of Nations? for to Thee only does it appertain,
etc. I make a decree that men tremble and fear before God; for he is the living
God, and his Kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion is to
the ends Dan. 6. 26.
of the earth.

3. Because of his powerful governing of all things, Isai. 25. 1. to 6.

4. Because of His particular and severe judgments against sins. My flesh
trembles Psalm. 119. 120.
for fear of thee, and I am afraid at Thy judgments. The just Lord is in the
Habb. 3. 1^.
midst thereof; every morning does he Zeph. 3. 5.
bring his judgments to light, he fails not, etc. When I heard, my belly
trembled, etc.

5. Because of the great and general judgment at the last day. If ye call on
Eccles. 12. 13, 14.
the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to every man's
work, pass the time of your sojourning here 1 Pet. 1. 7.
in fear.

6. Because of His threatenings, and the punishments attending thereupon. So God
said to good King Josiah, because thy heart was tender, and thou have humbled
thy self before the Lord, when 2 Chronicles. 34. 27.
thou heardest what I spoke against this place, and against the Inhabitants
thereof, etc. and have rent thy clothes, and wept before Me, I have heard thee,
says the Lord.

So the repentant thief on the Cross, said to the other thief, Do not thou
Luke 23. 40.
fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?

7. Because of the benefits and mercies of God: there is mercy with thee, that
Psalm 130. 4. and 72. 5.
thou may be feared. They shall fear thee as long as the Sun and Moon
endure. Wicked men say not in their heart, Let us now fear the Lord our God,
that gives Jer. 5. 24.
rain in his season, he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.

8. We should fear the Lord because 2 Pet. 1. 3.
of all those great and precious promises He has made to all those that fear
Him.

But of those we have given plentiful instances before.

Some Sentences more about the fear of God.
1. When a good thing is done out of the fear of punishment, and not out of the
true fear of God, it is not well done.

2. Why do we fear man when we are placed in the heart and bosom of God, and
are sure we can never fall away there-hence?

3. The fear of God is an especial antidote and preservative against the fear
of man.

4. Our present fear of God now, will bring us everlasting peace, rest, and
security.

5. To fear God truly, is to omit or neglect nothing willingly, which He
commands.

6. In the ways of the Lord begin with fear, and then we shall come to
confidence, strength and courage.

7. He is a stranger to the grace of liberty, whom the service of fear merely
binds and obliges.

8. Know thy self, that thou may fear God: know God, that thou may love
Him. For the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the end of the
Commandment is charity. Even as out of knowledge of thy self, the fear of God
comes into thy heart: so if thou know God as thou ought, thou will be
sure to love Him.

9. He will easily swerve from the way of righteousness, who fears men more
than God. For the fear of man brings a snare.

10. If the love of God, cannot keep thee from sin; let the dread of Him who is
a sin-revenging Judge terrify thee; the fear of hell, the snares of death,
that burning fire, the ever-gnawing worm, those pains of hell, stinking
brimstone, black flames of fire, the blackness of darkness for ever, and all
those miseries accompanying it, which are insupportable to be born, impossible
to express, passing all understanding to conceive, at least terrify thee from
sin.

11. The fear of man brings distrust, but the fear of the Lord brings strong
confidence, ^rov. 14. 26.

12. He that truly fears God, loves God: and he that truly loves Him, fears
Him. For these in our worshipping of God are conjoined, and cannot be separated.

13. When thou hear that God is merciful, see that thou love Him: when thou
hear that God is just, see that thou fear Him; that being stirred up both by
the love and fear of God, thou may be careful to strive to keep His
Commandments.

Pray therefore with David, O let me Psalm. 119. 1^. 1.
not w^nder from Thy Commandments. And O that my ways were directed to keep Thy
Statutes. Always remembering that frequently iterated precept of our blessed
Savior, If ye love Me, keep My Commandments.

EXERCITATION THE FIFTH.
Psalm. 62. 5. My Soul wait thou only upon God: for my expectation is from Him.
OH how good is it to wait upon God! they alone who have found the benefit of
it, know how good it is.

There be three especial ingredients, to make up this duty of waiting upon God:
1. Faith. 2. Patience. 3. Diligence.

1. Faith; which is the substance of Heb. 11. 1*
things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen. Faith is the bottom of
our waiting upon God. Faith discovers to us, on what grounds we may stand; as
namely upon God's faithfulness and all sufficiency, etc. and therefore David
still encourages himself, (as twice in this Psalm) to wait upon God.

2. Patience; waiting implies delay; and delay without patience is
insupportable. Hope deferred makes the heart Prove. 13. 12.
sick. Delay is a sore sickness, and Patience is the only cure of it; without
which, that sickness will prove death.

3. Diligence and activity; he that waits for a mercy, must serve God's
Providence in the use of all the means, which God has ordained and appointed
for the accomplishment thereof. It is Diligence as well as Faith and Patience,
that must inherit the promises. We desire that every one of you do show the
same diligence, to the full assurance of hope unto the end: that ye be not Heb.
6. 11, 12.
slothful, but followers of them, who through faith and patience inherit the
promises. Waiting without diligence, is nothing but slothfulness and security.
Waiting signifies a patient abiding, and expectation of help from God. I waited
Psalm. 40. 1, 2, 3.
patiently upon the Lord; and He inclined His ear unto me, and heard my cry: He
brought me also up out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my
feet upon a rock, and established my goings. And He has put a new song in my
mouth, even praise unto our God.

I will wait upon the Lord, I will not go back from Him; I will try or use no
unlawful means, but will wait in His Isai. 26. 8.
way, and expect His help and aid, and the fulfilling of His promises;
depending wholly upon Him and His Word.

Faith apprehends the promise, and thereby brings forth Hope; and Faith by
means of Hope, makes them that believe to wait.

God is not like to man: but in whatever He promises, He approves Himself
most faithful, both in His ability and performances. I will therefore trust in
the Name of the Lord, and stay Isai. 50. 10.
my self upon Him my God.

This waiting upon God is a virtue, Definition.
whereby we are inclined to the expectation of those things, which God has
promised to us. If we hope for that we Romans 8. 25.
see not, then do we with patience wait for it.

This waiting, this expectation,

1. It has God for its principal object; that our faith and hope might be in 1
Pet. 1. 21.
God: and the less principal objects are all those things, whereby as by means
and steps, we come to God.

2. It has respect to God, as the Author and Giver of every good thing, which
it expects. Every good gift, and Jam. 1. 17.
every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights;
with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. Commit thy way to
Psalm. 37. 5.
the Lord, rest also on Him, and He shall bring it to pass. Everywhere in the
Old Testament, where the Hebrew word (...) which is wont to be rendered Hope,
it signifies properly expectation. And the word (...) in Greek signifies more
than bare expectation; it signifies patient expectation, and that unweariedly,
from (...), maneo, I tarry: so (2 Thessalonians. 3. 5.) it is rendered, into the
patient waiting for Christ; namely by which expectation, we expect till Christ
shall come to judge both the quick and dead: there it is taken passively, for
the expectation in or by which Christ is expected by us.

The Septuagint render these words thus, (...). My Soul subject thy self to
God; for my expectation (or my abiding, continuance, patience, perseverance,)
is from Him. (...), subjectio, simply signifies, sub alio jacere, to lie under
another: but properly it signifies more, as namely, to be subordinate, or to
subject our selves in an orderly way. So it denotes an orderly subjection; and
implies the reverence of the heart, respectful speech and gesture, obedience
without resisting, a willing subjection, and in due manner as is required. So,
be subject, is a general word, comprehending all other duties, and services; to
be obedient in all things.

The word (...) signifies, tolero, sustineo* remaneo, persevero. A man must
((...)) stay, abide, and stand, under his weight and burden, until God ^ase
him. Magis significat expectationem, and longanimitatem, quam adversitatum
tolerantiam; sic alii. Proprie est, ipsa laudabilis sub cruce permansio
constans, and in virtute cum crucis tolerantia vel contemptu perseverantia.

Properly it signifies that laudable constant abiding under affliction, and a
perseverance in virtue, not fainting under affliction, but constantly waiting
for God's promised help and succor; knowing that better things are reserved
for us. So we must not sink in our courage, nor shrink from our burden; and
then we shall both (...) and also (...). So said the Apostle, Ye have need of
patience, Heb. 10. 36.
that after ye have done the Will of God, ye may receive the promise.

There is another word in the New Testament used also for expectation, (...),
an earnest expectation, with Romans 8. 19.
holding up the head, stretching out the neck, lifting up the eyes, with an
earnest intention and observation to see, when the person or thing shall appear.

And one word more is used for expectation, namely, (...). But no more of this
now.

The same word in the S^ptuagint, is in Psalm. 130. 5. (...) I have waited upon,
or for thee O Lord; my soul does wait, etc.

Q. What are the signs of our true waiting upon God?

A. 1. If it r^st on the Grace of God alone, and His free promises.

2. If it breed in us a care in all things 1 Pet. 1. 13.
to please God. Every man that has this hope in him, purifieth himself as He
is 1 John 3. 3.
pur^^

3. If it persuade us diligently to use the means ordained of God; and ^eb. 10.
23, 24, 25.
to abstain from all others which are not lawful, and He has not appointed.

4. If we depend not on those means, but on God alone, working by and through
them. And so in thus doing Esth. 4. 13.
we may cheerfully go about our duty imposed on us by God; that according to
our earnest expectation and our hope, Phil. 1. 20.
in nothing we shall be ashamed, etc.

Q. By what means our hearts may be confirmed and strengthened against troubles?

A. 1. By fervency of spirit or zeal; that others may take notice of us, that
we have been with Jesus. Acts 4. 13.
we have been with Jesus.

2. By a true confidence in God alone: So if we commit our works unto the Prove.
16. 3.
Lord, our thoughts shall be established. If we cast our burden upon the Lord,
He will sustain us; He will never suffer the Psalm. 55. 22.
righteous to be moved. And the Lord Isai. 58. 11.
will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat
thy bones, and thou shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water,
whose waters fail not.

3. By faithful and fervent Prayers, commending and committing all our affairs
unto God. In every thing by prayer Phil. 4* 6.
and supplication with thanksgiving, let our requests be made known unto God.

4* By a sound judgment of those troubles wherewith we are assailed. For
sometimes many of them are merely to be contemned; as the foolish speeches of
vain men and women, etc. And sometimes they are mere fopperies, which when we
have weighed them in the balance of a clear judgment, do presently vanish
away; and always are such, that if they are duly compared with the dignity of
our place and Christian Calling, with the fruits and necessity of them, they
signify nothing at all.

Our waiting and hope is confirmed and increased by all those Arguments,
whereby we may be made more certain, that that good thing waited and hoped for,
does belong unto us. So experience works hope, and hope makes not Romans 5. 4.
ashamed.

This Hope is a virtue, whereby we expect all good things from God, and
patiently wait for all things that we need, at His hands; resting in the Lord,
and waiting patiently for Him, not only ^^^* 37. 7.
when we have the means, but also when (...). 3. 17.
we want all apparent means; y^a, and when the means seem contrary. As the
three Children answered Nebuchadnezar: Our God whom we serve, is able to
deliver Dan. 3. 17.
us, from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out of thine hand,
O King; but if not, be it known unto thee, O King, that we will not serve thy
gods, nor worship thy golden Image which thou have set up.

1. Wait believingly; The vision is yet Habb. 2. 3, 4.
for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak and not lie: though it
tarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry. The just
must live by faith. He that cannot believe, cannot live. Behold the husbandman
waits Jam. 5. 7.
for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, etc. Let
us learn of the husbandman; and from the constant experience and observation of
God's providence toward us, learn to wait upon God; For light is sown for
Psalm. 97. 11.
the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.

Therefore will we not fear, though the Psalm. 46. 2.
earth be removed; and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the
Sea. For this God is our God for ever and ever, Psalm. 48. 14.
He will be our guide even unto death. I had verily fainted, unless I had
believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the Psalm. 27. 13, 14.
land of the living: wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall
strengthen thine heart; wait I say on the Lord.

2. Wait patiently: For the patient expectation of God's poor Servants shall
not perish for ever. He that believes, Psalm. 9. 18. Isai. 28. 16.
makes not haste. If we wait upon God by saving faith, and an holy recumbency
of spirit, we will willingly wait for deliverance or supply, and will not make
haste to rid our selves out of such or such a calamity, or use any indirect or
unlawful means so to do. In returning and rest shall we be saved, in quietness
Isai. 30. 15.
and in confidence shall be our strength.

Foolish men and women in the impatiency of their spirits, do sin against God,
and their own arguments and reasons, and do sin away those mercies which else
would come unto them. David was in a holy temper of spirit in his affliction,
which he reports to us for our imitation: These things were our examples, 1
Cor. 10. 6. 11.
and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are
come. David said, I waited patiently Psalm. 69. 3.
upon the Lord. How long did he wait? even until he cried himself weary, his
throat dry, and his eyes dim. I am weary of my crying (said he) my throat is
dried, mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. Oh invincible patience!
unconquerable expectation! and he lost nothing by it, for so it follows, and
He inclined unto me, and Psalm. 40. 2.
heard my cry, etc.

The Apostle advises us, Let patience have its perfect work; that ye may be
Jam. 1. 4.
perfect and entire, lacking nothing: till all our Graces are tried, and God
has sifted us fully, if we will meekly and patiently depend upon Him, and
holily and humbly wait till He send deliverance.

There is a work of patience, it must not be an idle patience, but a patience
working in the use of all lawful means. And there is also a perfect work: to
bear a very heavy burden, and a long time, and that with patience; this does
show that patience has had its perfect work.

Be we patient, stablish our hearts, for the coming of the Lord draws Jam. 5.

nigh: that is, not in the general judgment at the last day, but in this or
that particular mercy or deliverance out of such a straight, trial or
affliction. Shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto*
Him, though He bear long with them? I tell you (says our Savior) He will
avenge Luke 18. 7, 8.
them, and that speedily: (that is, when God's good time is come.) Nevertheless
when the Son of man shall come, shall He find faith on the Earth? the meaning
is, that God oftentimes deferreth such or such a mercy or deliverance, until we
are even weary of waiting, our hope lost, our faith even spent, and so our
extremity God takes for His opportunity; then is Gods time to work; then
mercies will be most sweet, then most refreshing. Every thing is beautiful in
Eccles. 3. 11.
its time.

3. Wait diligently: Stir up thy self to take hold on God; waiting is no idle
posture, or sitting still. Engage thy Isai. 64. 7. Jer. 30. 21.
heart to approach unto God.

Consider that the blessing does not consist in the removal of an affliction,
but in the sanctified use of it. And therefore blessed is the man, whom thou
chastenest, Psalm. 94. 12.
O Lord, and teach him in thy Law: When instruction and correction go
together, that is a blessed and happy correction. Labor therefore for a
sanctified use of every affliction, to be purged and purified thereby. Give a^
^ Pet. 1. 10.
diligence to make thy calling and election sure. Keep thy heart with all
diligence. Prove. 4. 23. Heb. 6. 12.
And show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope, unto the end.
Looking Heb. 12. 15.
diligently lest we fail of the Grace of God: So let us be diligent in our
waiting, that we may be found of God in peace, 2 Pet. 3. 14.
without spot, and blameless.

I wait for the Lord, my Soul does Psalm. 130. 5.
wait, and in His word do I hope. God will have us to wait, until He come and
rain righteousness upon us. Oh how Hos. 10. 12.
does our blessed Savior wait upon us! standing at the door of our hearts, and
knocking; saying, Open to Me, My Sister, Rev. 3. 20.
My love, My dove, My undefiled, Cant. 5. 2.
and so woes us, for to let Him come into our hearts; and we wickedly shut the
door of our hearts against Him, and refuse His offers of Grace and Mercy, and
put Him off with delays; yet He stands still, and knocks, and waits* till His
head is filled with dew, and His locks with the drops of the night.

And He has sent forth His Ministers also to woo for Him, and to pray us in 2
Cor. 5. 20.
Christ's stead, that we would be reconciled unto God. We know not how long God
may wait for us: Now is the acceptable 2 Cor. 6. 2. Heb. 3. 7.
time; now is the day of salvation. Hear while it is called to day. Lay hold on
Grace while it is offered. And strike while the iron is hot. Remember
Jerusalems case; how our Savior wept over it, spoke and wept, wept and spoke,
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would Luke 19. 41. to 44.
I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathers her chickens under
her wings! I would, but thou would not; therefore desolation, misery and
confusion followed.

God waited 120 years for the repentance and conversion of the old world. 40
days for Nineveh: God waits for Genesis 6. 3. Jonah 3. 4. Ezekiel. 18. 21. 2 Pet.
3. 9. Romans 2. 4.
poor sinners; not willing that any should perish, but that all should repent
and live. Yet they despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and
long-suffering; not knowing that the forbearance of God should move them to
repentance. If we hear not while it is called to day, but Heb. 3. 8. Prove. 14.
9. Prove. 23. 32.
harden our hearts through unbelief; and like fools make a mock of sin, at
length it will sting like a serpent, and bite like an adder.

God has His appointed time, when he will wait no longer. As Solomon spoke of
temporal things, so do I of spirituals, and things of everlasting concernment:
Man, most men, know not Eccles. 9. 12. and 8. 6, 7.
their appointed time, therefore the misery of man is great upon earth. Laesa
patientia fit furor: Patience abused, turns into fury. Now mercy is offered;
mercy sits at the helm. Justice will have its course; and that upon all those
who come not in, nor accept of this golden Scepter of Grace and Mercy now Rev.
6.
held forth. They shall have a cup of the pure wrath of the Almighty; a cup of
pure wrath without mixture, no drop of mercy or pity more, ever to be expected
or hoped for! (Oh who knows the Psalm. 90. 11. Rev. 14. 10.
power of God's wrath!) They shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which
is poured out without mixture, into the cup of His indignation, and shall be
tormented with fire and brimstone, etc. and the smoke of their torment
ascends up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day nor night, etc.

But I have expatiated too far upon God's waiting for poor Sinners. For God
will have His glory magnified; if His Mercy and Grace be not so, in the
Conversion and Salvation of poor Sinners: His justice will be for ever
magnified and glorified in their everlasting confusion and condemnation. So God
will be no loser at all.

But now according to the words at first read, come we to man's waiting upon
God. My soul wait thou upon God.

The Lord waits that He may be gracious Isa^. 30. 18.
to us, (as we have seen) and He will be exalted that He may have mercy upon
us; for the Lord is a God of judgment: Blessed are all they that wait for him.
Jacob in the midst of blessing his Children, as in an holy rapture, breaks
out in this pathetical expression, I have waited for Thy Salvation, O Lord.
Genesis 49. 8.
Likewise the Church, O Lord be gracious unto us, we have waited upon Thee: Be
Thou our arm every morning; our Salvation Isai. 33. 2.
also in the time of trouble. Let these examples of Saints formerly, stir up
and encourage us still to wait upon God: yea, though He seem to hide His face
from us: as the Church complains, Verily, Thou art a God that hidest Thy self;

(yet in faith she calls Him) O God of Israel the Savior. His way is in the
sea, and his paths in the mighty waters; and his footsteps are not known.

habitation of his throne. God has not said to the house of Jacob, seek ye Me

vain. Be not as those wicked idolatrous Jews, who said, It is in vain to serve
God; and what profit is it, that we have kept his ordinance, and walked
mournfully before the Lord of hosts? Although Mal. 3. 14.
God rewarded their outward labors about His Service: that He would not have
them to shut the doors for naught. nor kindle fire on His altar for naught; the
meanest service to go unrewarded. Let us so wait as we Mal. 1. 10.
ought, and it will not be unrewarded. Let us wait and work work and wait: our
labor will never be in vain in the Lord. This is our waiting and working 1*
Cor. 15. 58.
time, our praying and seed-time: we sowing in righteousness here, shall reap
Hos. 10. 12. 2 John 8. Prove. 11. 18. Psalm. 84. 6. Psalm. 126. 6.
in mercy hereafter; even a full reward and a sure reward. He that goes forth
and weepeth, (in this valley of tears) bearing precious seed, shall doubtless
come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him. He shall have sheafs
in stead of grains; even a full measure Luke 6. 38.
pressed down, shaken together, and running over, shall be given to him. For
God is not unrighteous, to forget our work of faith, our labor of love, and
our patience in waiting. Be not like that Heb. 6. 10, 11*
wicked Servant, who said, My Lord delayeth his coming; and so fall to
riotting, and to be swallowed up with the pleasures and vanities of this world;
the Lord of that servant will come in Mat. 24. 51.
^ day that he looked not for Him, and in an hour when he is not aware, and
will cut him in pieces, and give him his portion with hypocrites, in the Lake
that burns with fire and brimstone for ever. Therefore be servent in spirit,
Romans 12. 13.
serving the Lord. Watch and pray, for thou know not at what hour the Master
of the house comes; whether at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or dawning
Mark 13. 35.
of the day: Lest coming suddenly, He ^ind thee sleeping. And be not weary in
well-doing; for in due season, thou shall Gal. 6. 9.
reap if thou faint not.

Wait God's leisure, wait His time; God knows the sit time; when mercy is
ripe for us, when we are fit to receive such or such a mercy; when we are
thoroughly humbled and reformed, when we know how to value the mercy aright; how
to use it; how to improve it wisely, and not to abuse it: when our hearts are
taken off from all creature-props and confidences; when God has exercised and
tried our Graces, and us also to the utmost; thus long God will have us to
wait: that the trial of our faith being much 1 Pet. 1. 7.
more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might
be found unto praise, and honor, and glory, at the appearance of Jesus Christ.
Now for the word Only. Wait thou only upon God. For He alone is able to support
us, uphold, and encourage us in our waiting upon Him; to supply all our wants,
and to fulfill all our desires. He will fulfill the desires Psalm. 145. 19*
of them that fear Him; He also will hear their cry, and save them. He alone is
able to supply all our need, according to His riches in glory, by Phill. 4: 19.
Jesus Christ.

The word here rendered wait, in the Hebrew the Original, signifies is silent.
Which denotes, my Soul is silent, without any murmuring, fretting, or repining,
and so resolved to wait upon God; to await His leisure, His good-pleasure, and
blessed will, and that with patience, contentment, and satisfaction, I wholly
resigning my self to Him. So the word in the Septuagint (...) signifies, my
soul subject, or submit thy self wholly unto God; be obedient to Him in all
things; run not to rest or rely upon instruments or means, but wait wholly
upon God.

1. If thou trust on means, there thou will fail. For riches be uncertain,
therefore trust not in uncertain riches. Hod^e Craesus, cras Irus: Job was the
1 Timothy 6. 17.
richest man in the morning, before night he was poor to a Proverb; As poor as
Job. Will thou set thine eyes upon Prove. 23. 5. Psalm. 52. 7. Jer. 19 1. Zeph.
1. 18. Psalm. 62. 10. Isai. 30. 12. Hos. 10. 13. Luke 11. 22.
that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings, they fly away
at an eagle toward heaven. Neither our Silver nor our Gold shall be able to
deliver us in the day of the Lord's wrath. Trust not in oppression, etc. Do not
trust in thine own way; nor to thine own righteousness; ( Ezekiel. 33. 13.) nor in
thine armor or weapons of war; nor in thine own heart ( Pr^v. 28. 26.) for the
heart of man is deceitful above all Jer. 17. 9.
things, desperately wicked, etc.

2. If thou rest or rely on instruments or men, they will fail: Cursed is the
Jer. 17. 5.
man that trusts in man, and whose heart departs from the Lord. A man would
think, if he should trust in any man, surely then it is best to trust in
Princes, but the Lord bids us, Put not Psalm. 146. 3, 4.
your trust in Princes; nor in the Son of man, in whom there is no help, his
breath goes forth, he returns to his earth; in that very day his thoughts
perish. Therefore trust in the Lord Prove. 3. 5.
with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own understanding. That so thou
may say to the Lord, Thou art my goodness, and my fortress, my high tower,
and my deliverer, my shield, Psalm. 144. 2.
and He in whom I trust. And they that trust in the Lord, and wait only upon
him, shall be as mount Zion, which Psalm. 125. 1.
cannot be removed, but abides for ever.

Thus far for the former part of the Verse, My soul wait thou only upon God:
Now for the latter words, for my expectation is from him.

From the sense and apprehension of the love and favor of God unto us in
Christ, there follows a patient enduring, a confirmed hope or confidence, and
an undoubted expectation of mercies from God. Which we describe thus, to be an
unwearied and perpetual continuation of the same purpose and resolution of
attending upon God. Or an abiding with patience, and a continual looking for,
and expectation of help from God.

My expectation is from Him, for temporal, spiritual, and everlasting mercies.

1. For temporals; and here, 1. For Psalm. 104. 21.
maintenance and provision; The young lions seek their meat from God. He ^ob.
38. 41.
feeds the young ravens when they cry unto Him. If God feed the beasts and
birds, surely He will not suffer the soul Prove. 10. 3. Psalm. 37. 10. Isai. 33.
16.
of His people to famish. In the days of fumine they shall be satisfied. Bread
shall be given them, their waters shall be sure. And as for raiment; If God
cloth the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the
oven, shall he not much more cloth us? Mat. 6. 30, 31, 32.
Therefore take we no thought, saying, what shall we eat, or what shall we
drink, or wherewithal shall we be clothed? for our heavenly father knows we
have need of all these things. Be we diligent and industrious in our places,
ever using lawful means; that is our part for to do. But the care of provision
and maintenance is God's part, which we must leave to Him; Who has promised to
bless our lawful and honest endeavors, subservient to His holy will and
command.

2. As for maintenance and provision, so also my Expectation from God is, that
as I have committed all my ways to Him, and trust in Him, so He will bring them
Psalm. 37. 5. Josh. 5. 9. Romans 8. 28.
all to pass for the best. That he will roll away my reproach; and cause all
things to work together for my good. He will plead my cause and execute
judgment for me, He will bring me forth Micah 7. 9.
to the light, and I shall behold His righteousness. My Redeemer is strong,
Jer. 50. 34.
the Lord of hosts is his name. He shall Isai. 51. 22.
thoroughly plead my cause; for He has styled Himself, the God that pleads
the cause of His people. The Lord God of recompenses will surely requite. Jer.
51. 56.
My expectation is higher than these temporal things, as heroically and
Christianly Luther once said; Lord, I have sworn and am resolved that I will
not be put off with these lower things, or to esteem them my portion, etc.

2dly, But my expectation is higher, my expectation from God is chiefly for
spiritual and everlasting mercies. That Acts 26. 18.
as He has opened mine eyes, and turned me from darkness to light, and from
the power of Satan unto God; so that I Ephesians. 5. 8, 1^
may walk as a child of light, and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works
of darkness, but rather reprove them Having respect to all God's Commandments;

lusts, to live soberly righteously Godlily, in this present word. To grow Tit.

in Grace, and in the knowledge of my Lord Jesus: that of His fullness I may
receive, and Grace for Grace; that so may make my calling and election sure
being filled with the fullness of God that he will grant me according to the
riches of his glory, to be strengthened with all might by his Spirit in the
inne^ man; that Christ may dwell in my hear^ by faith, etc. that as he who has
begun 16. 17.
a good work in me, will also finish Phill. 1. 6. Heb. 12. 2.
it. For he is the author and finisher of my faith, Who is able to build me up
^ Acts 20. 32.
and that He will settle, strengthen, and stablish me, in every good word and
work, to do His will; working in m^ 1 Pet. 5. 10. Heb. 13. 21,
that which is well-pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ. That I Phill.
1. 10, 11.
may approve those things which are excellent, being sincere and without
offense, filled with the fruits of righteousness, etc. Pressing toward the
mark, Phill. 3. 11, 14.
for the price of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus; if by any means I
might attain unto the resurrection of the dead; that is, to such a measure of
Grace and Holiness, as I shall have 2 Timothy 3. 17.
at the resurrection of the dead: that I may be perfect, thoroughly furnished
unto every good work.

And for my outward conversation, that it may be as it becomes the Gospel
Phill. 1. 27. Tit. 2. 3, 10.
of Christ, as becomes holiness, that I may adorn the doctrine of God my
Savior in all things; so that the Word of Verse 5.
God may not be blasphemed. nor the way 2 Pet. 2. 2. Jam. 1. 27.
of truth evil spoken of, through my default; and that I may keep my self
unspotted of the world; walking so as 1 John 2. 6.
Christ walked, while He was here upon the earth.

That after I have served my generation by the will of God, and shall fall
asleep, and be gathered to my fathers, Acts 13. 36. 2 Timothy 4. 7.
and see corruption; after I have fought a good fight here, finished my course
Heb. 12. 28.
and kept the faith; I may receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken; an
inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, that 1 Pet. 1. 4. jude 1.
fades not away, reserved in heaven for me, and to which I am preserved in
Christ Jesus.

This is my hope, this is my expectation; for I know whom I have believed; and
I am persuaded, that he is able to 2 Timothy 1. 12.
keep that which I have committed to Him, (even the keeping of my soul, and the
crown of everlasting life) against that day.

The Lord is the portion of my soul, I am. 3. 24: Prove. 23. 18.
therefore will I wait for Him; and my expectation shall not be cut off. For
they that wait on the Lord, shall renew their strength; they shall mount up
with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary, Isai. 40. 31.
they shall walk and not saint.

Now, the Lord direct our hearts into the love of God, and into the patient 2 Thessalonians. 3. 5.
waiting for Christ.

Be not weary in well-doing: continue Addition. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 13.
to wait upon God. Take heed of impatiency of spirit; like Joram, that wicked
King of Israel (in that dreadful man-devouring famine of Samaria) who 2 King.
6. 33.
though he acknowledged, this evil is from the Lord; (yet impatiently and
wickedly added) wherefore should I wait on the Lord any longer? He was
convinced of the hand of God in His judgments upon Him; so rationally he should
have concluded; therefore will I wait upon Him, and seek to Him for relief: Vna
eademque manus, vulnus opemque feret; the same hand that wounds, the same hand
must bring the cure. It had been more rationally inferred, this evil is from
the Lord; therefore upon Him will I wait; to Him will I address my self for
deliverance. But he concludes, as in the Hebrew it is Mah Ochil ^adonai; Quid
expectabo Dominum? wherefore should I wait on the Lord? why should I fast and
pray? or carry my self patiently as the Chaldee has it? or, as in the
Septuagint (...), quid deprecabor? why shall I pray against it any longer?
Remember the case of Israel, when they were even at their Journeys end, near
upon the borders of the promised land, because of their murmuring and
impatiency: hear their terrible doom from the Lord, As truly as I live, says
the Lord, as ye have spoken in mine ears, Numb. 14. 28 to 36.
so will I do to you: your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness, and all
that were numbered of you, from twenty years old and upward, which have
murmured against me; doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning
which I swear to make you dwell therein; save Caleb the son of Jephunneh and
Joshuah the son of Nun. But your little ones which ye said should be a prey,
them will I bring but as for you, your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness:
and your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your
whoredoms until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness: After the number
of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days (each day for a
year) shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years; and ye shall know my
breach of promise. I the Lord have spoken it, I will surely do it, etc. in this
wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall dye.

Take heed of fretting against the Lord, and of impatiency of spirit, lest the
same or the like judgment befall thee. But say with David as here, My soul,
wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from Him.

EXERCITATION THE SIXTH.
Mark 1. 15. Repent ye, and believe the Gospel.
HEre our Savior sets down the way that lost man must take to come to God;
whom does our blessed Lord invite to come unto Him? those that labor and are
heavy-laden. Repentance Mat. 11. 28.
and Faith are the way whereby we come unto God: Christ is primarily the way,
for no man comes to the Father, but by Joh. 14. 6.
Him: He is the immediate way; but these are the ways in and through Him, which
He has prescribed.

1. To speak of Repentance.

We must know our sins, feel the weight of them, be truly sensible of them, and
that we are no way able to help our selves; else we will never come to Christ,
and never seek out for a Savior; for the whole have no need of a Mat. 9. 11.
Physician, but they that be sick: while we think our selves whole and healthy,
we are well enough; but it is the sinsick Soul that sees his want and need of
this great Physician, the Lord Jesus. So Desinition.
then Repentance is a hearty grief for my sins, even because thereby I have
broken God's holy Laws, and offended such a gracious Father, which works in me
a hatred and loathing of sin, and of my self for sin, with a resolution to lead
a new life. Now there is a legal Division.
repentance, which is a grief of mind, through the sense of God's wrath
threatened against sin, without any true hatred of sin. There is also, secondly,
an Evangelical repentance, which is a through change of a sinner, in mind,
will, and actions, from evil to good. The former of these was in Ahab, who put
on sackcloth and went softly, etc. 1. Kings 21. 26.
when he heard the evil threatened against him and his house; and this may be in
wicked men, through fear of punishment and of hell; not for their sins against
God: so upon the next temptation they run into sin again. But Evangelical
repentance, which is because we have broken God's Laws, and offended so
gracious a Majesty; this it makes us more watchful over our ways, more desirous
and careful to please God, more Ephesians. 5. 15. Genesis 17. 1. Psalm. 16. 8. 2 Cor. 7.
10, 11.
fearful to offend Him, more circumspect in our walking before Him, setting Him
before our eyes. Godly sorrow works repentance unto life, not to be repented
of: whereas legal repentance (which is common to wicked men) works death; or
is the forerunner of death; whose grief is from an apprehension of their
miseries, or some wounding of their Consciences for their sins, without faith,
or amendment, or conversion unto God; whereby all their repentance is in them
an entrance or a way to a death. But behold the good effects of a serious
Evangelical repentance; The self-same thing that ye sorrowed after a Godly
sort, what sorrow it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of your selves, yea,
what indignation, yea what fear, yea what vehement desire, yea what zeal, yea
what revenge. I know that some do take the former part of this sentence merely
in a literal sense, Wordly sorrow causes death; that is, sorrow or grief for
outward crosses and losses causes such anguish of mind, so affecting the body,
that brings sicknesses, diseases, and death at last. We see then, that true
repentance is an inward and hearty sorrow for sin, especially that we have
offended so gracious a God and so loving a Father; together with a settled
purpose of heart, and a careful endeavor to leave and Psalm. 119. 112.
forsake all our sins* and to live a Christian life according to all Gods
Commandments.

So the parts of repentance are, 1. A The parts of true* repentance are ^our.
confession of sin. 2. a Bewailing what we have confessed, 3. Lifting our
selves up with confidence in Gods mercies and Christ's merits. 4. With a firm
purpose of abstaining from sin, and obeying Gods Commandments. Let us a little
farther* consider these. 1. An humble Confession: I acknowledged my sins unto
thee, and mine iniquities Psalm. 32. 5:
have I not hidden; I said I will confess mine iniquities unto the Lord. 2. A
bewailing Dan. 9. 6. 8. Ezra. 9. 6.
of what we have confessed; We are ashamed and blush* to lift up our fa^es to
thee, O our God; for our iniquities are increased over our heads, etc. Psalm.
38. 18.
I will be sorry for my sins. 3. A lifting up of our selves in confidence of
Gods mercies through Christ's merits: There Psalm. 130. 3.
is mercy with thee that thou may be feared. In the multitude of thy mercies
I come unto thee: with the Lord there Psalm. 5. ^. Psalm 130. 7.
is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous redemption. And through Christ's
merits; Christ dyed for the ungodly. To Romans 5, 6.
this end, Christ both dyed; and rose, Romans 14. 9.
and revived, that He might be Lord both of dead and living. Christ dyed for
our 1 Cor. 15. 3. 1 John 2, 2. Heb. 7. 25.
sins according to the Scriptures. He is the Propitiation for our sins. And He
is able to save to the utmost all that come unto God, by Him; seeing he ever
lives to make intercession for them. Fourth part of repentance is, a steadfast
resolution of forsaking sin, and of obeying Gods holy Commandments.

I hate every* false way, whosoever confesses Psalm. 101. 3. Prove. 28. 13. Psalm.
119. 8.
and forsakes his sins shall have mercy. Then shall I not be confounded when I
have respect to all thy Commandments.

So we must be broken from our sins, Psalm 119. 101. 104.
and for our sins; not only to leave and abhor some sins, but every way of
wickedness utterly to abhor: To hate Romans 12. 9. Psalm. 19. 12. Psalm. 18. 23.
every false way; and to refrain our feet from every evil way; abhor that which
is evil, even secret sins, and beloved sinners, to keep our selves from our
iniquity, That beloved sin which we have long used, and is even natural and
customary to us; and that sin which does Heb. 12. 1.
so easily beset us; which may be as dear to us as the right hand or the right
eye, yet to pluck out these sins, Matt. 5. 29, 30.
and cut them off, and cast them from us.

And not only to hate sin, but to abhor Job 42. 6* Ezekiel. 6. 9. and 20. 43.
our selves for it, and loath our selves in our own sight, for all those evils
we have committed. This this is true repentance, which unless we have, and
attain unto, we shall never be saved: Deuteronomy. 9. 7. Psalm. 27. 7.
It is not enough to repent once; we must remember our former sins, the sins of
our youth, yea our original sin; for we were shapen in iniquity, and in sin did
our mother conceive us. Eccles. 7. 20. Prove. 24. 16.


Daily let us renew our repentance, as we sin every day. A just man falls
seven times, and rises up again, that is, many times, a certain number for an
uncertain: Even as a candle newly blown out, and yet smoking, is kindled and
revived by a little breath; So a Soul is delivered from ordinary dangers and
streights, by a timely ( viz.) a daily repentance. A member out of joint must
be set as soon as may be; else a callous substance may grow in the Cavity, and
hinder the placing of it in again; So unless we renew our repentance daily, a
callous hardness may grow on our hearts, and hinder our renewing again by
repentance. Thus far of the first step of our recovery out of a natural
condition, into a state of Life and Salvation; for God will bring us as by the
gates of Hell unto Heaven; first He will bring us low, before He will raise us
up. A child is about four weeks in the dark cell of the womb, and thence it
comes out through difficulties and pains, which makes it cry when it comes into
the World: Even so a child of God is held sometimes in the dark, to make him
see his misery in a natural lost condition; and then with pain and grief
through the mortification of sin, He comes into newness of life, to be born
again by the Word and Spirit, and so is made the child of God. Except a John 3.
5.
man be regenerate, and (thus) born again, He cannot enter into the kingdom of
God.

Now the second step is, And believe the Gospel:

So we see that repentance and Faith are the ordinary means, our blessed
Savior here prescribes to Salvation. The word (Faith) has five acceptations
in Scripture.

1. Faith is taken (by a metonymie of the adjunct for the subject) for the
doctrine of Faith, or the Gospel which we do believe: Holding Faith, and a 1 Timothy 1. 19.
good conscience, which some having put away, concerning Faith have made
Shipwreck; Holding the mystery of Faith 1 Timothy 3. 9. 1 Timothy 4. 1. Jude 5. Jam.
2. 19.
in a pure conscience.

2. Faith is taken for historical or dogmatical Faith; Thou believe there is
one God, thou do well; the devils also believe and tremble. This Faith,
which is common both to the reprobate and elect, consists in a bare assent.

3. There is a temporary Faith, which is the knowledge and joyful assent of the
mind, yielded to Gods promises for a time, till afflictions come. He that Mat.
13. 20, 21.
receives the seed into stony places, is he that hears the word, and anon
with joy receives it, yet has he not root in himself, dureth but for a while;
for when tribulations or persecutions come because of the word, by and by he is
offended.

4. There is a Faith of miracles; which is a certain persuasion of some strange
effects and works to be done by the power of God. If I have Faith, so that I
could remove mountains: If you 1 Cor. 13. 2. Mat. 17. 20.
have Faith, ye should say to this mountain, remove hence to yonder place, and
it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossi^le to you. This Faith was granted
but for a certain time, and was given to reprobates also; as appears by the
example of Judas I^oariot, to whom the gift of working miracles was given as
well as to the rest of the Apostles.

5. But there is a saving Faith; which we define thus, A virtue, by which,
adhering to Gods faithfulness, we rest upon Him* that we may obtain what He
has promised to us; Or, it is a firm and constant apprehension of Christ and
all His merits, as they are promised and offered in the Word and Sacraments: Or
once more it is the gift of God, by which an elect man applies to himself all
the free promises of Christ made known in the Gospel, and so he most sweetly
rests upon them.

The just shall live by Faith, this is the Romans 1. 17.
Faith of Gods elect, which is proper to the elect, and which none can have but
the elect and chosen of God. As Titus 1. 1, 2. Acts 13. 48.
many as were ordained to eternal life believed. The general object of true
saving Faith, is the whole Truth of Go^ revealed; but the special object of
Faith as it justifies, is the promise of remission of sins by the Lord Jesus:
So the^ God when he gives this Faith, 1. H^ enlightneth the understanding, to
see the truth and preciousness of the rich offer^ of Grace in the Lord Jesus:
The ligh^ shines in darkness; now we have received John 1. 5. 1 Cor. 2. 11,
12. 14.
the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things which are freely
given to us of God. 2. God enables the will to embrace these rich offers of
grace, and to stretch out all the desires of the Soul after them, and to rest
and build everlasting comfort upon them. The things of God as they are 1 Cor.
1. 18. 2. 14.
foolishness to man's natural judgment, so they are enmity to his natural will.
And therefore when God gives Faith, He gives a new light to the understanding,
and new motions and inclinations to the heart. As the Covenant of grace is, I
will give them a new heart. Ezekiel. 36. 26.


It must be a mighty power to turn the heart of man upside down, and cause him
to pitch all the desires of his Soul on a supernatural object. No man John 6.
44. Ephesians. ^. 19, 20.
can come to me, except the Father draw him: That ye may know what is the
exceeding greatness of His power to us ward who(...)eve, according to the
working of His mighty power, which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him
from the dead, etc. Here is the exceeding greatness of Gods power, and the
working of His mighty power, which is expressed as much in the conversion of a
sinner; and in working saving Faith in his heart, as it was manifested in
raising Christ from the dead. O the great power, Ephesians. 2. 4. 56.
riches inmercy and greatness of the love of God to poor sinners! (And to me in
especial) Wherewith He has loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses and
sins, has quickened us together with Christ, and has raised us up together,
and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Furthermore, the
principal efficient cause of Faith, is God; the impulsive cause is His free
grace, by which we are elected and called; the instrumental cause whereby Faith
is given to us, in those of ripeness of age, is ordinarily the word of God:
Faith comes by hearing, and Romans 10. 17.
hearing by the word of God. And yet not the preaching of the word alone. but
as it is joined with the efficacy of the Holy Spirit: For the Lord opened Acts
16. 14.
the heart of Lydia, that she attended to those things spoken by Paul. Th^^
^^tter of our Faith (which is as the ob^ect) largely, is the Word of God:
properly, the free promises of the Gospel, founded upon Jesus Christ. The
righteousness of God, Romans 3. 22. verse 25.
which is by Faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe:
Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation, Romans 10. 9.
through Faith in His blood. If thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord
Jesus, and shall believe in thine heart, that God raised Him from the dead,
thou shall be saved.

So then, justifying Faith consists in these two things, 1. In having a mind to
know Christ. 2. In having a will to rest upon Him. Whosoever sees so much
excellency in Christ, that thereby he is drawn to embrace Him as the only Rock
of Salvation; that man truly believes to justification.

Thus far of the description of Faith, the several kinds of Faith, and the
causes of it, that we may know the nature of true justifying saving Faith: Such
a Faith as our Savior here requires. Oh! this precious Faith, of what 2 Pet.
1. 1.
absolute necessity is it? Necessary to everlasting Salvation: We are kept by 1
Pet. 1. ^.
the power of God through Faith unto salvation; Believe on the Lord Jesus Acts
16. 32.
Christ, and thou shall be saved: Which was the answer the jailer had of Paul,
when he asked, What he must do to be saved? Without Faith it is impossible Heb.
11. 6. verse 2.
to please God: by Faith the elders obtained a good report. Faith causes us to
apprehend those deep mysteries of salvation, which by the eye of Sense we can
never fathom; as Trinity in Unity, the Incarnation of the Son of God, etc. The
Word is unprofitable to us, if it be not mixed with Faith. In the Sacrament Heb.
4. 2.
we receive no more than we do believe, have thou no Faith? thou reapest no
fruit or benefit or comfort. If thou prayest, thou must pray in Faith, nothing
Jam. 1. 5, 7.
wavering; else do not think to receive any thing of the Lord. Whatsoever Mark.
11. 24.
things ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them; and ye shall
have them. So we see that Faith is of absolute necessity in all our spiritual
duties; Worship, and Services. Pray we therefore with the disciples; Lord
increase, Lord strengthen our Faith. Luke 17. 5. Acts 15. 9. Romans 3. 28. Gal.
2. 16.
Faith it purifies the heart. Aman is justified by Faith. We are justified
before God, only by Faith in Christ. i. e. by Christ's righteousness imputed to
us by God, and received and laid hold on by us with a lively Faith. As Faith
justifies, it also quickens: The righteousness of God Romans 1. 17.
is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, the just shall live by
faith. Faith is the means of obtaining and professing a spiritual life: ( From
faith to says) that is to say, more and more, according as Faith increases and
grows stronger; so it does more and more enjoy the benefit of this
righteousness of Christ imputed.

Labor therefore to be strong in faith; Abraham being strong in faith, gave
Romans 4. 20.
glory to God. The stronger in Faith, the more glory may thou bring to God.
They which be of faith are blessed Gal. 3. 9.
with faithful Abraham. Our faith must be a working faith: Faith works by
Gal. 5. 6.
love. It shows it self by the fruits of a new-life, which are comprehended
under the love of God and our neighbor. 1 Thessalonians. 1. 3.
We read of the work of faith; our faith must not be a dead and idle faith, but
a lively and working faith; showing it self by its fruits and effects: Ja^m. 2.
18. verse. 20.
Show me thy faith by thy works; faith without works is dead.

There can be no justifying and saving faith separate from good works: for he
who truly does good works, has a lively faith, which is the root and spring of
them, and good works are proper, perpetual, and inseparable from a true and
lively faith. So we must reconcile those two places of Scripture which seem
contrary to each other; in Jam. 2. 24. Ye see then, that by works a man is
justified, and not by faith only; and Romans 3. 28, We conclude, that a man is
justified by faith without the deeds of the law: the meaning is thus, We are
justified before God, only by faith in our Lord Jesus Christ; but our good
works (which are the true fruits of saving lively faith) declare us to be just
before men. Let us therefore be fruitful in every good C^^^. 1. 10. Coll. 2. 7.
2 Thessalonians. 1. 3. Heb. 10. 22. 2 Pet. 1. 1. Jude 20. Romans 3. 22. Rev. 14. 12.
work, and be stablished in the faith; let our faith grow exceedingly, that we
may have that full assurance of faith. This faith as it is a precious faith, as
we said before; so it is a most holy faith* It is called the faith of God, Romans
3. and the faith of Jesus Christ: where the object is put for the subject. And
in our spiritual armor, above all we are Ephesians. 6. 16.
bid, to take the shield of faith, whereby we shall be able to quench the fiery
darts of the Devil. Now a shield is an instrument of War, made for defense, to
award and keep off the blows of an enemy; such a shield is faith, to bear off
and beat back the sierce temptations of Satan; whom we must resist being sted
fast in the faith. 1 Pet. 5. 9.


Faith fills the heart full of spiritual joy; and therefore these two are
joined together, believing we rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.
And so 1 Pet* 1. 8. 2 Pet. 1. 6, 10.
a believer strives to add to his faith virtue, etc. to grow and increase more
and more, never to give over reaching forth, and pressing toward the mark; if
by any means he might attain unto the resurrection Phill. 3. 11.
of the dead: to attain to such a measure of Grace and Holiness, as I shall
have at the resurrection of the dead; when I shall receive the end of my faith,
1 Pet. 1. 9.
even the salvation of my soul: where faith shall for ever be swallowed up with
fruition.

EXERCITATION THE SEVENTH.
Psalm. 93. 5. Holiness becomes Thine house, O Lord, for ever.
HOliness in the Septuagint is rendered (...), sanctimonia, from (...) sanctus;
which (...), as some say, is from (...) veneratio, ab (...) veneror, colo. Then
it implies that holy persons are true worshippers of God. 2. Others derive it
from (...), a privative particle, and (...) terra, quasi extra terram, vel sine
^erra; then it denotes, that Saints must not be glewed to the earth, but
trample all earthly things under their feet. 3. Others derive it from (...)
duco, because the Godly are led in the ways of God. So said the Apostle, As
many as Romans 8. 14.
are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

Holiness is the end of our election; for God chose us in Christ, before the
Ephesians. 1. 4.
foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before Him in
love.

This Holiness makes the Church and people of God, and every particular Servant
of His, to excel all the world besides. For Saints and holy persons are
excellent persons; they are more excellent Psalm. 16. 3. Prove. 12. 2^.
than their neighbor. This comely and becoming, this excellent dress of
holiness makes us like the most holy God. Therefore He commands us, be ye holy
as I am holy; and be ye holy, for 1 Pet. 1. 15, 16.
I the Lord your God am holy: If we would show our selves God's Children, and
call Him Father, let us be followers Ephesians. 5. 1.
of God as dear children, endeavoring to come near His nature, by Holiness and
Sanctimony of life. Yea, God is Holiness it self in the abstract, Once have I
Psalm. 89. 35.
sworn by My holiness, etc. that is, by my Self, who am holiness it self.

Holiness applied unto God, is, that Holiness of God what it is.
Divine uncreated essence, which being it self most holy and undesiled, loves
every thing which is so; and loatheth and hates every thing which is not so.
The men of Bethshemesh after they had so pryed into the Ark, experimentally
said, Who can stand before this holy Lord 1 Samuel 6. 20.
God?

Holiness applied unto men, signifies Holiness of men what it is.
that created quality of pureness, wherein the Saints resemble God, being pure,
severed in part from the mixture of sin, as God is holy and pure. Here we are
unperfectly pure and clean and unpolluted, separate from sin and corruption;
but such we shall be most perfectly in heaven. So the nearer that any come to
God in holiness, the more they are like unto God, best liked and beloved of
Him. Therefore this should breed in our hearts a love of holiness, and a hatred
of whatsoever is contrary unto it: it should kill in us all evil thoughts and
opinions of God that may rise in our hearts; seeing in Him who is holiness it
self, there can be no iniquity. No evil shall dwell with Him; He hates all
Psalm. 5. 5.
those that are workers of iniquity. He cannot endure to behold iniquity in the
sons of men, but with indignation. He Habb. 1. 13.
is of purer eyes to behold evil.

Holiness is a real change of a man, Definition of Holiness.
from the filthiness of sin, into the purity of the image of God. To put off
concerning the former conversation, the old man which is corrupt, according to
the Ephesians. 4. 22, 23, 24.
deceitful lusts, and to be renewed in the spirit of our mind: and to put on
the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.

Christ is the sum of the whole Scriptures; therefore necessarily He (who is
the new man) must be the rule of holiness.

Holiness is a conformity unto Christ; if we consider the nature of it when we
are reindued with that image of God, after which we were at first created. We
were predestined to be conformed Romans 8. 29.
to the image of His Son: that is, to be conformed to Christ, in His nature
which is Holiness; in His end which is blessedness; and in the way thereunto,
which is by sufferings.

So our holiness must bear a proportion to Christ's holiness; for conformity
cannot be without proportion.

1. Our holiness must have the same principle and seed with Christ's holiness,
namely His Spirit.

2. It must be conformable to Christ's holiness in the ends of it, as the glory
of God, and the good of the Church. Romans 11. 36.


3. Our holiness must be proportionable to Christ's holiness in regard of the
parts of it: it must be universal: to have respect to all Gods* Commandments,
and that with the whole man both Soul and Body. So the Apostle prays for the
Psalm. 119. 8. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 23.
Thessalonians, And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God,
that your whole spirit, and soul and body, be preserved blameless, unto the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

4. In the manner of working; and there, 1. It must be done with selfdenyal. So
said our Savior, If any Mat. 16. 24.
man will follow Me, let him deny himself, etc. 2. It must be done in obedience
to God: so Christ said, In the volume Heb. 10. 5.
of thy book it is written of Me to do Thy will, O God; Lo, I come to do thy 7.
9.
will O God. 3. It must have growth and proficiency with it: therefore we are
bid to grow in Grace and in the 2 Pet. 3. 18.
knowledge of our Lord Jesus. A plant while it has life in it, will grow; so a
Child etc. Even so we, while we have the life of true Grace in us, will strive
to grow, and make proficiency in the ways of holiness.

Sanctification is a real change both of our quality and dispositions. Of Lions
Isai. 11. 6.
we become Lambs; though we were fierce, cruel, hard-hearted, etc. formerly;
Sanctification makes us gentle, meek, easy to be entreated, peaceable, ^am. 3.
17.
full of mercy, and good fruits, etc. Briefly it is a change of the whole man,
and that wholly; for the Holy Spirit make a through work, a through change,
although usually it is by degrees.

Here is the term from which, and the term to which we are changed.

1. The term from which; from the filthiness, corruption and stain of sin:
therefore we are bid to cleanse our selves from all filthiness both of flesh
and ^ Cor. 7. 1.
spirit.

2. The term to which; is the purity of the image of God; which is said to be
renewed in knowledge, righteousness, Coll. 3. 10. Ephesians. 4. 24. Jam. 1. 25. Romans
6. 4. 2 Cor. 5. 17.
and holiness. This is called a conformity to the law of God: Newness of life:
A new creature: and the Divine nature, 2 Pet. 1. 4.

There are two degrees of Sanctification

1. Begun and imperfect, which is here in this life.

2. Perfect and consummate, which is in Heaven; where alone perfection is to
had.

The parts of Sanctification are two, Mortification: Vivi^^cation.

1. Mortification, or dying to sin; and thereby we have a freedom from the
dominion of sin by the death of Christ. Ye are dead, etc. Mortify therefore
your Col. 3. 3, 5.
earthly members. Our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might
be destroyed, that henceforth we should Romans 6. 6, 7.
not serve sin; for he that is dead is freed from sin.

2. Vivification, or quickening unto newness of life, by the power of Christ's
resurrection. Blessed and holy is he Rev. 20. 6.
that has part in the first resurrection. Or Vivification is the second part
of Sanctification, whereby the image and life of God is restored in man.
Therefore Ephesians. 4. 24. Romans 12. 2.
put on that new man; and be ye transformed, by the renewing of your mind.

From this Vivification, arises in those that are Sanctified, a firm obliging
of themselves unto God, whereby they dedicate and devote themselves unto God
and Christ. So said the Apostle, they gave themselves unto the Lord. 2 Cor. 8.
5.


Hence follow these two things.

1. A spiritual war, which is continually waged between these two parts: The
flesh lusts against the spirit, and Gal. 5. 17. 1 Cor. 9.
the spirit against the flesh; and these two are contrary the one to the other.
So sight I, not as one that beats the air: but I keep under my body, and
bring it into subjection, etc. And this continual combat must we maintain
while we are in this body of flesh.

2. A daily renewing of repentance; as we daily do sin.

Now the end of all this is,

1. The glory of God: He that has 1 John 3. 3.
this hope in him, purifieth himself as God is pure.

2. Our own Salvation: He that purges 2 Timothy 2. 21.
himself from these shall be a vesse^ sanctified unto God, and meet for the
Masters use.

Q. What must we do that we may b^ holy?

A. 1. Subject our whole man to the Word of God; for the Word is the
sanctifying truth of God. Therefore Christ prays, Sanctify them by thy
truth, The Joh. 17. 17.
word is truth.

2. By faith to apply Christ to ou^ selves as our Sanctification, for He of Go^
1 Cor. 1. 30.
is made unto us Sanctification: therefore suck holiness from Christ.

3. By a lively faith not only to apprehend and lay hold on the promises i^
general; but also those promises in particular, which do more especially belong
to Sanctification. Then I will sprinkle Ezekiel. 36. 26, etc.
clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and
from all your Idols I will cleanse you.

4. To give our selves to the Holy Spirit, that we may be led and guided by Him
in all things. As many as are Romans 8. 13, 14.
led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. So we also are sanctified
by the Holy Spirit. Being sanctified by the Holy Ghost. God has chosen us to 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13.
salvation, through sanctification of the Romans 15. 16.
Spirit, and belief of the truth.

There are three things must be observed for holiness sake.

1. Shamefacedness of body.

2. Chastness of mind; for we may commit contemplative adultery, with wanton
glances of the eye; so Christ said* whosoever looks on a woman to lust after
her, has committed adultery with Mat. 5. 28.
her already in his heart.

3. Truth of Doctrine.

It was a notable speech of St. Ambrose, Let us learn the envy of former
Saints, that we may imitate their patience, (for they showed no envy in their
sufferings, but merely patience) and let us know them not to be of a better
nature than we are, but of greater obedience: Not that they did not know vices
and corruptions as well as we, but they strived more to subdue and amend them.
He that desires to live and reign with Christ, must strive* to keep himself
from deceit and wickedness. If thou will live with Christ, thou must live after
the example of Christ. And if thou desire to have fellowship with the Saints,
strive to cleanse thy heart from all thoughts of malice and wickedness. For the
heavenly Palace will receive no^e but holy, just, innocent and pure persons.

The first degree of holiness is to love holiness: and then to love those who
live holily. For holy persons were not before holiness, but holiness was before
them. He does speak foolishly who says that he loves and respects holy
persons, who sleighteth and contemns holiness. By this we know that we love
the children of God, when we love God 1 John 5. 2.
and keep His Commandments.

Entertain into thy heart that Holy Spirit of promise. If thou have not the
Spirit of Christ, thou art none of His. Ephesians. 1. 13. Romans 8. 9.
He who has Christ, has holiness; for holiness has a double relation unto
Christ.

1. As Christ is the principle and fountain of holiness whence it comes.

2. As He is the rule and pattern of holiness, to which it answers; of these
two more fully.

1. Christ is the principle of holiness, by whom it is wrought: He Isai. 26.
1^. Psalm. 87. 7. Joh. 1. 16. Psalm. 133. 2.
works all our works in us: all our springs are from him: Of his fullness we all
receive, and Grace for Grace. The ointment ran down from Aarons head to the
skirts of his garments; to denote the effusion of the Spirit of holiness from
Christ unto His lowest members.

2. Christ is the rule and pattern of holiness to His Church: Therefore we 1 John 2. 6.
must walk so as Christ also walked.

Now the works of Christ are of two sorts.

1. Incommunicable, as these, 1. His works of Merit, and Mediation: and 2. His
work of government and influence into the Church; His giving of the Spirit;
Quickening of His Word; Subduing of His Enemies; Gathering together of His
members; all these are personal honors which belong to Him as He is the Head
of the Church.

2. His communicable works, which are imitable by us, and which we ought to
follow; so our Sanctification consists in a conformity to the ways of Christ's
ordinary obedience. So we read, that Christ went about doing good: No guile
Acts 10. 38. 1 Pet. 2. 22. Joh. 4. 34.
was found in His mouth: He made it His meat and drink to do his Fathers will.
when he was reviled, he reviled 1 Pet. 2. 23.
not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed his cause to him
that judges righteously: He learned obedience by the things which He suffered:
Heb. 5. 8. Luke 22. 42. Joh. 13. 14. Joh. 2. 14* 17.
He resigned His will to God's will: He showed us an excellent pattern of
humility in washing His Disciples feet: showed admirable zeal for the glory of
God: and when He was thereunto called, meekly resigned His Soul Luke 23. 4^.
into the hands of God. And so the whole life of Christ was an exemplary
precept unto men: and we ought not to follow men, any farther than they 1 Cor.
11. 1. Rev. 14. 4.
follow Christ. Let us follow the Lamb, whithersoever He goes. Now if Christ
be a rule and pattern of holiness unto us, then let us take heed that we be not
a rule to our selves. Every thing that Moses did about the material Tabernacle,
was to be done according to the pattern which he had seen in the Heb. 8. 5.
Mount.

And every thing which we do in these spiritual Tabernacles, we are to do it
after the pattern of Him, who is set before us; looking unto Jesus, the Heb.
12. 2.
Author and finisher of our faith. So let us be regular in all our speeches and
actions, doing all according to rule; walking exactly and accurately (as the
Apostle bids us) so the word (...) in Ephesians. 5. 15.
in the Original signifies, Not as fools, but as wise; though the wise fools of
the world may think us too precise therein. And let us enquire out of the
Scriptures, whether Christ would have done this or that, or no? at least
whether He allow it or no. And as many as Gal. 6. 16.
walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel
of God. And thus while we follow Christ, we are out of all danger: whosoever thus
Prove. 1. 33.
hearken to Him shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil; being
sure to be upheld and kept by Him in His way. The more we follow Christ, the
nearer still we come unto Him.

Let us deny our selves, our natural self, and our sinful self; and Christ will
be all in all unto us.

He will guide us, comfort, counsel, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 17.
settle, strengthen, stablish us in every good word and work, in this our
Pilgrimage, in the life of Grace here; and Psalm. 73. 24.
at length in His own good time bring us safely to the life of glory hereafter.

Thus we see what a comely and becoming thing holiness is: what holiness is,
and the parts of it, and how to attain it.

Holiness is a becoming thing. As Moses when he had long conversed Exodus 34. 29.
with God, his face did shine: So the Saints whose fellowship truly is with the
Father, and with His Son, Jesus Christ, do shine as lights in the 1 John 1. 3.
^hil.* 2. 15.
world.

Holiness makes us comely as in the sight of God, so also in the sight of men.
So the promise is, In that day (that is, Isai. 4. ^.
in the times of the Gospel) the Branch (that is, Christ) shall be beautiful
and glorious; and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely; that
is, the Spouse and people of Christ, who are chosen out of the world, and who
live upon the earth, they shall be excellent and comely.

So the Saints are comely through Christ's comeliness which He has put upon
them. Oh how great is his goodness, Ezekiel. 16. 14. Zech. 9. 17. Psalm. 149. 4.
and how great is his beauty! he will beautify the meek with Salvation.

The Sanctification of the Elect and chosen of God, it is to be taught by the
Holy Spirit through the Ministry of the word in the Gospel, of the good will of
God toward them, to be regenerated, and through faith to be made the temples
of God and members of Christ; that they may mortify the deeds of the flesh,
and walk in newness of life, going on in that way, apprehending comfort and joy
in God, and so are kept to life everlasting.

God's sanctifying of us, and our sanctifying of God, do differ: for we
sanctify God by believing, by attributing to God His holiness; that is, all
His holy attributes which He claims to Himself in His Word, by acknowledging
and confessing them; and by our holy obedience. Sanctifying of God, contains
the whole worship of God. God sanctifies us, by making us inviolable, safe and
secure against Sin, Hell, the World, Death, Devil, Enemies, and all Evils. God
sanctifies us, in teaching us by His holy Spirit through the Ministry of the
Gospel, of His goodwill toward us, by regenerating us, and by faith making us
the temples of God, and members of Christ; to mortify the flesh, and to walk
before God in newness of life, and so are kept to life eternal.

Thus far of holiness, and the word becomes: Now of the next words, Thine
house O Lord for ever.

The house of God in Scripture has several acceptations, it signifies and it
is taken sometimes for,

1. Heaven, which is God's upper house, His house of Glory, of which Joh. 14. 2.
Christ said, In My Fathers house are many mansions. And St. Paul calls it, a
building 2 Cor. 5. 1.
not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Here, even the poorest Saint, who
has not an house to put his head in upon earth, has yet an house in Heaven,
into which, no unholy thing shall enter.

2. It is taken for the Church and people of God; whether,

1. Distributively, every pious person is God's house: Whose house Heb. 3. 6.
are we?

2. Collectively; and then it is taken sometimes for a particular assembly: So
St. Paul said to Timothy, that thou may 1 Timothy 3. 15.
know how to behave thy self in the house of God, which is the Church of the
living God, etc. And sometimes it is taken for the Catholic Church; and this
Heb. 3. 2, 5.
is here meant, whether the whole Church of God, or every individual person,
holiness becomes them, and is required of them.

3. By the house of God in Scripture sometime is meant the true Religion taught
and professed within the Church of God: The zeal of Thine house has Psalm. 69.
9*
eaten me up.

4. The temple at Jerusalem, whereof it is spoken, My house shall be called the
Luke 19. 46*
house of Prayer.

The temple of God is holy; whose temple 1 Cor. 3. 17.
we are. Every thing about the material temple and in it, was holy; even so
must we be; and that in all the faculties and powers of our souls, and in all
the members of our bodies.

Let us therefore have holy and heavenly thoughts, holy and gracious speeches;
Let our speeches be always gracious, Col. 4. 6.
seasoned with salt, (with the salt of wisdom and discretion) that it may Ephesians.
4. 29.
minister Grace unto the hearers; that others may be edified, and bless God for
our holy and religious speeches and discourses.

And let our affections be set upon heaven Col. 3. 2. Phill. 3. 20.
and heavenly things: and our conversation be in heaven; but the word here
rendered conversation, is in Greek (...), from (...) a City; holding forth thus
much, that we are Burgesses, Citizens, free-Denizens of Heaven, and therefore
it is the property as well as the glory of all holy persons, true believers, to
whom only Heaven belongs, to live in this world as if they were in Heaven
already; Since God, when we Ephesians. 2. 5, 6.
were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, and has raised us
up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. The
meaning is thus; there is a most strict union between Christ our glorious Head,
and us His members: that which is done to the Head, is done and belongs to
all the members; therefore the members of Christ's body, in right and in virtue
of the infallible cause, and in certainty and assurance of faith, are already
raised up and glorified, and at the appointed time shall really and effectually
be so. Thus as members of so blessed an Head in Heaven, let us so live in this
world as if we were in Heaven already; bending all our thoughts and desires,
all our speeches and actions that way; having heavenly thoughts when we are
about our earthly and worldly employments. And so walk in that way which is
called the way of holiness; that holiness to the Isai. 35. 8. Ze^h. 14. 20.
Lord may be written both on our hearts and foreheads: for the Lord has called
us not unto uncleanness, but unto holiness: that God may establish our hearts
unblameable 1 Thessalonians. 4. 7. and 3. 13.
in holiness before Him. That our holiness may not be like the righteousness of
the Israelites, as a morningcloud, and as the early dew that passes Hos. 6. 4.
away; therefore God threatened them, That they should be as a morning-cloud,
and as the early dew that passes away, as the chaff that is driven with a
whirlwind Hos. 13. 3.
out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the Chimney: that is, they should
not be steadfast or established, but quickly dispersed and brought to nothing.

But let us walk as becomes holiness; Titus 2. 3.
how much soever holiness is slighted and derided by the profane ungodly
wretches of this world, yet strive we to go on perfecting holiness, in the fear
of 2 Cor. 7. 1.
God. For without holiness, no man shall Heb. 12. 14.
see the Lord; that is, to his comfort* So that yiedling our members servants
Romans 6. 19, 22.
to righteousness unto holiness, we may have our fruit unto holiness, and the
end everlasting life.

To sum up this last briefly: Has God quickened us together with Christ, and
has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in
Christ? That is, not only so has done, spoken in the Preterperfect tense for
the Future tense, that He will assuredly do it, or that it is as sure as if it
were already done; for that we do believe. But this expression signifies
something more; that as we are mystical members of the body of Christ,
quickened, and raised up together with Him, and made to sit together in heavenly
places in Him: How then should we have raised thoughts, sanctified affections,
and a holy and heavenly conversation? being clothed with the long white robes
of the Imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ the Sun of Righteousness; to have
the Moon Rev. 12. 1.
(which is in the lowest Orb) that is, all these sublunary and lower earthly
things under our feet. Therefore, what manner of persons ought we to be in all
holy conversation and Godliness; looking for, and hastening unto the coming of
the day of God, etc. And since we look for such things, to be diligent that we 2
Pet. 3. 11, 12, 14*
may be found of Him in peace, without spot and blameless.

Wherefore, as we are thus partakers Heb. 3. 1: 2. 14.
of the holy and heavenly calling, let us consider the Apostle and great High
Priest of our profession, even Jesus the Son of God; and 6. 20.
who as our forerunner is for us entered into the heavens, and is gone to
prepare a place for us: so will He come again, and Joh. 17. 17. 19.
receive us unto Himself, that where He is there we may be also; that we may
for ever behold the glory which His Father, and our Father has given Him. Who
when He was here upon earth prayed to His Father to sanctify us through His
truth, his word is truth: And for our sakes did he sanctify himself, that we
also might be sanctified through the truth. For both he that sanctifies, and
they who Heb. 2. 11*
are sanctified are all of one; therefore he is not ashamed to call us brethren.

For our sake did he sanctify himself: the meaning is, though He was perfectly
holy and sanctified in His humane nature, wherein for us He did accomplish all
righteousness, and all manner of holiness: He did consecrate Himself to the
death of the Cross, to cleanse us from all our sins, and to procure for us the
gift of the Holy Ghost, to regenerate us in a holy and permanent newness of
life.

We are Gods house: the Temple ^eb. 3. 6.
(God's house under the Law) was overlaid within with pure Gold. Let us
especially look to our hearts, our inward parts, and strive to cleanse our 2
Cor. 7. 1.
selves from all filthiness of the spirit as well as of the flesh. For out of
the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, Mat. 15. 19, ^0.
etc. These are the things which defile a man. Oh these heart-wickednesses! The
heart is as a cage full of unclean birds. The heart of man is deceitful Rev.
18. 2.
above all things, desperately Jer. 17. 9.
wicked, who can know it?

Let us give our hearts to God, as He Prove. 23. 26.
commands us; For the Lord searches the heart, and tries the reins, and has
1 Chronicles. 29. 17.
pleasure in uprightness.

God is the great heart-maker, He must be the heart-mender. Go to God in these
or the like expressions, and pray, O create in me a clean heart, O Psalm. 51. 10.
God, and renew a right spirit within me. Let my heart be perfect with Thee, 1
Kin. 8. 61.
that I may walk before Thee in truth, in righteousness, and in uprightness;
Jer. 30. 21.
and may engage my heart to approach unto God; to walk before Thee, to do every
thing as in Thy sight and presence. Lord, help me to keep my heart with all
diligence; and to wash Prove. 4. 23.
my heart from wickedness, that I may be clean; that although vain and evil
Jer. 4. 14:
thoughts will pass through me, yet I may not give them entertainment, or
suffer them to lodge within me. Take Thou away this stony heart from me, and
give me a heart of flesh, a heart Ezekiel. 36. 26.
pliable and flexible and capable of being governed and guided by thy Spirit.
Unite my heart to fear thy name. Let Psalm. 86. 11. and 119. 80.
my heart be sound in thy statutes: That so, when my heart is sound, Christ may
set me as a seal upon his heart, and as a seal upon his arm, keeping me nearly
Cant. 8. 6.
and dearly joined unto Him, and refresh me by the comfort of the presence of
His Grace; setting me as a signet upon his right hand, to have me always Jer.
22. 24.
in His eye and in His heart, to be present with me, to guide me in His ways,
to bless me, and to do me good: that at last He may present me glorious, not
having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but holy and without blemish. For
holiness becomes thine house, O Lord, for ever; as here in this life, which is
glory begun, so especially in Heaven (where Grace and Glory is consummate and
made perfect) into which place no unholy thing shall ever enter.

Holiness is the badge of Christ's people: Addition. Isai. 63. 18.
they are called the people of his holiness: Israel was holiness to the Lord,
Jer. 2. 3.

The Spirit of holiness distinguishes and sets a mark upon the sheep of
Christ, they are sealed with the holy Spirit of promise. Ephesians* 1. 13.


Holiness sets us apart for God and Psalm. 4. 3. Tit. 2. 14.
for His Service, to do His Will, and to serve Him; He has set apart him that
is Godly, for himself; to see and enjoy him, for without holiness none shall
see Heb. 12. 14.
the Lord: Our holiness is not the cause of our Salvation; but it is the way
thereunto.

Holiness has none but gracious and honorable effects, it fills the soul
with joy, comfort, and peace; with joy unspeakable and full of glory; with Romans
15. 13. 1 Pet. 1. 8. Isai. 32. 17.
peace, and quietness, and assurance for ever. Everlasting joy shall be upon
their heads; They shall obtain joy and gladness; and sorrow and sighing shall
Isai. 35. 10.
flee away. God is glorious in holiness; and glories most in the Attribute of
holiness. God stands upon nothing more, than to appear to all the world to be a
Exodus 15. 11.
holy God: therefore the Angels when they celebrate the glory of God, cry out,
Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God of hosts. Isai. 6. 3.
Let those therefore that draw nigh to God, and make profession of his name,
labor to hold forth above all things, the glory of his holiness in their lives
and conversations.

EXERCITATION THE EIGHTH.
Jer. 23. 9. For because of Oaths swearing, the Land mourns.
IF the holy Prophet in his days, cried out as in the former Verse, Mine heart
within me is broken, because of those cursings and oaths, which do make the
Land to mourn; that is, which draw down God's judgments upon the Land; as it is
evident in the following words, the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried
up; namely, God did send drought and scorching heats, and withheld the rain in
its due season for those crying sins; so it cannot be meant Metonymically, the
Land for the People of the Land; but the Land mourned, because the people had
no hearts to do it.

Oh what cause have we now to break our hearts with sighting! to have rivers
Psalm. 119. 136.
of water to run down our eyes, because God's Laws are so broken, and his name
so highly dishonored, by hellish Oaths and Blasphemies, by damned damning
curses and execrations; whose judgment 2 Pet. 3. 2.
lingreth not, and their damnation slumbereth not. These as natural brute
beasts. made to be taken and destroyed; shall Verse 12.
utterly perish in their own corruption. These are raging waves of the Sea,
foaming Jude 13.
out their own shame, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.

We read of a flying roll, which is interpreted a curse that goes forth over
Zech. 5. 2, 3, 4.
the earth; for every one that steals shall be cut off on that side,
according to it: and every one that swears shall be cut as on that side
according to it. I will bring it forth, says the Lord of hosts, and it shall
enter into the house of him that swears falsely by My name, and it shall
remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, with the timber
thereof, and the stones thereof.

Oh this dreadful denunciation! O that profane Swearers would consider it, and
lay it to heart! hearing God's dreadful threatenings on themselves both Souls
and Bodies, and all that they have, yea even their houses and habitations where
they dwell, and that for their sakes. How many times does the Lord God, and how
frequently forbid this horrid sin of Swearing?

Ye shall not falsely swear by My name, Levit. 19. 12.
neither shall thou profane the name of the Lord thy God; I am the Lord.
Wherever in Scripture this is added, I am the Lord, it is to show, that God
is faithful in revenging the breach of His Commandments; and on the contrary,
that He is faithful in rewarding the observation, or keeping His Commandments.

Our blessed Savior bids us, Swear not at all; (that is, in our ordinary
discourses,) but let your communication be Mat. 5. 34. 37.
yea, yea; nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these, comes of evil. The
word in the Original is, (...), from that evil one, meaning the Devil, who is
the father of all lies, oaths, and blasphemies. Joh. 8. 44.
So Saint James, But above all Jam. 5. 12.
things (my brethren) swear not; neither by heaven, neither by the earth, (that
is, by nothing which is either in heaven or earth) neither by any other oath;
but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into damnation. No
less punishment than everlasting damnation, is here threatened against all
profane Swearers.

If of every idle word that we shall Mat. 12. 36.
speak, of the same shall we give account at the day of judgment: how much more
then of every horrid oath, and wicked cursing? Oh that the terror of 2 Cor. 5.
11.
the Lord might awaken and persuade men! The Lord is a Sin-revenging God, a
consuming fire, a jealous God. Who Heb. 12. 29. Isai. 33. 14.
can dwell with everlasting burnings, who can dwell with devouring fire? These,
even these ungodly Swearers shall, and that for ever; for the Lord has said,
He will not hold him guiltless that takes His name in vain.

God will have us to fear and reverence His glorious and fearful name, the
Deuteronomy. 28. 58. Psalm. 99. 3.
Lord our God. Let men praise His great and terrible name, for it is holy.

The Jews heretofore were, and yet still are so superstitious, erring too much
on the right hand, that they mention not the Name of God, but by a
circumloquution, and so had diverse phrases to express God by; as Caiaphas said
to Christ, Art thou the Son of the Blessed? Mark 14. 61.
would not say of God or of the Lord. But these on the contrary, cannot speak
six words without an oath; and think it a Gentile quality, and a gracing to
their speeches, to swear by the great and dreadful name of God. I must not say,
they are Atheists, although I really Tit. 1. 15, 16.
believe them so to be: their mind and conscience is desiled; They profess that
they know God; but in their works they deny Him; being abominable, disobedient,
unto every good work reprobate.

Like as they abhor not evil, and abhor Psalm. 36. 4* and 10* 3. Zech. 11. 8.
to walk in God's ways, even so the Lord will abhor them. Their worm shall not
dye, neither shall their fire be quenched, Isai. 66. 24.
and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh.

Although they think, (as their brethren of old, those wicked rebellious Jews)
that they have made a Covenant with death, and that they are at an agreement
with Hell; that when the Isai. 28. 15.
overflowing scourge shall pass through, that it shall not come unto them. But
the Lord tells them, your covenant 18.
with death shall be disanulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand;
when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down
by it.

Some may think me too invective or ^atyrical against these profane Swea^ers;
let such know, that these are the people against whom the Lord has indignation
for ever. They are God's Mal. 1. 4.
^nemies that take His name in vain; Psalm. 139. 20.
which should cause grief of heart, and detestation of spirit to all those that
love and fear the Lord. So the following words of David are, Do not I hate
Verses 21, 22.
them O Lord that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up
against thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred, I count them mine enemies. We
have not a prophetical spirit as David had, to know certainly God's enemies,
although by their fruits they may be known; we Mat. ^. 20.
may and must hate their vices and wickednesses; and leave them to the
righteous judgment of God; continuing to mourn for these abominations which do
make the Land to mourn, and not ceasing to pray for them; If peradventure 2 Timothy 2. 25, 26.
God will give them repentance unto life, and that they may recover themselves
out of the snare of the Devil, who are taken captive by him at his will, to do
his will.

Never was a child more like his father, than they are like their father the
Devil, whose works they Joh. 8. 44.
do.

By cursing and swearing, whoredom Hos. 4. 4.
and adultery, they break out: for usually these abominable sins with others
the like, do go together; they that make no conscience of one sin, neither will
they of another. And when once the Devil has gotten sound footing in such or
such persons, he drives them on without resistance. They break all bonds
asunder, and cast all cords from them: no bounds will hold them; neither Psalm.
2. 3. Luke 18. 4.
the Laws of God nor man, (for they fear neither) nor the checks of their own
Consciences. But like fed horses, Jer. ^. 8.
neigh after their neighbors wise: therefore God will cast them into a bed
(but it shall be a siery one) into great tribulations, Rev. 8. 22.
except they repent of their deeds: for whore-mongers and adulterers Heb. 13. 4.
God will judge; though they may escape the judgment of men, yet God will
assuredly judge them, and will render to every one according to his 2 Cor. 5.
10*
works. Although while they are here, they make the Land to mourn, and the
earth to groan under them, to bear such wicked wretches. God will come, and
Romans 8. 2^.
put a difference between him that swears and him that fears an oath. So
Eccles. 9. 2.
we leave these Swearers who have attained to the highest form in the Devil's
School.

By all these things we are taught how grievously they do sin, who swear so
rashly, and easily, oaths flowing from them as water out of a conduit, in their
ordinary speeches and discourses, ( whose mouths are full of cursings and
bitterness, Romans 3. 14. Job 15. 5.
whose mouths utter their iniquities; their own mouth condemns them, Verse 6.
and their own lips testify against them:) they in the mean time not thinking
that thereby they do expose the glory and the name of God to scorn, and so do
urge and provoke God to show and inflict the severity of His judgments and
vengeance upon them: for the Lord will not suffer those to go unpunished, who
thus take His name in vain.

The Son of Syrach said, Accustom not Ecclesiasticus 23. 9, 10, 11*
thy mouth to swearing, neither use thy self to the naming of the holy one. For
as a servant that is continually beaten, shall not be without a blew-mark; so
he that swears and names God continually, shall not be faultless. A man that
uses much swearing shall be filled with iniquity; and the plague shall never
depart from his house: If he shall offend, his sin shall be upon him; and if he
acknowledge not his sin, he makes a double offense: and if he swear in vain,
he shall not be innocent, but his house shall be full of calamities.

There is none that frequently swears, but sometimes he forswears or perjureth
himself: like-as he who uses his mouth to multitude of words, sometimes must
needs speak unfit things. Therefore said the wise man, In the multitude of
words Prove. 10. 19.
there wants not sin.

But some will think to say, O Lord, O God, O Jesus, etc. in their common talk;
or in a wondering way, good God! good Lord! is no sin. Know assuredly, that
such foolish admirations, and taking of God's Holy name lightly into our mouths
on every slight occasion, is utterly condemned in the third Commandment. So the
Reverend Archbishop Usher, and many other reverend and learned Divines do
firmly conclude.

There is also a superstitious and idolatrous oath, to swear by an idol; or by
Gods Creatures, as by the Mass, our Zeph. 1. 5.
Lady, etc. by bread, fish, salt, fire, Amos 8. 14.
light, and many suchlike fond trashes. Whereas God never made or appointed
His creatures for such uses.

Others will plight their faith and troth to every trivial thing; which is an
evident sign that they have little faith or truth in them, or know not the true
worth and value of them; else they would not so lightly lay such precious
Jewels to pawn upon every slight occasion.

Let all such, and every one also, remember our blessed Savior's rule
aforementioned, in all their ordinary speeches and communications, Swear not
at all, but let your yea be yea, and your nay nay, for whatsoever is more,
comes of evil. But of this, we shall have occasion to speak more anon.

Now to speak what an oath is, the parts of an oath, how an oath may be
lawfully taken, and other things.

An oath is, the craving of God's testimony to confirm the truth of our
testimony.

Men swear by the greater; and an Heb. 6. 13. 16.
^ath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. Deservedly is the
testimony or witness-bearing of God, called to confirm a truth: for He is the
truth, who neither can deceive nor be deceived.

About an oath consider two things:

1. How an oath is to be taken?

2. How it is to be performed?

Q. 1. How to be taken?

In taking of an oath, four circumstances are to be considered. 1. The parts of
an oath. 2. The form of an oath. 3. The end of an oath. 4. The diverse sorts or
kinds of an oath.

1. The parts of an oath, and they are four,

1. Confirmation of a truth.

2. Invocation of God alone, as a witness of a truth; and a revenger of a lie.

3. Confession, that God is a revenger of perjury, when He is brought in as a
false witness.

4. A binding over unto punishment, if we use deceit.

2. The form of an oath: we must swear,

1. In truth, lest we forswear.

2. In righteousness, lest we swear to that which is wicked.

3. In judgment, lest we swear rashly, or for a trifle.

So we must swear truly, advisedly, and rightly. As it is commanded, Thou shall
swear the Lord lives, in truth and Jer. 4. 2.
in righteousness and in judgment. They who do not thus are reproved, which
swear by the name of the Lord, and make Isai. 48. 1.
mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.

3. The end of an oath, which is, to confirm some necessary truth in question;
either for the ending of controversies, or for the performing of promises. So
an oath for confirmation, is among men an end of all strife.

4. The diverse sorts or kinds of an oath: 1. Public. 2. Private.

1. Public, when the Magistrate does upon just cause exact a testimony under
the reverence of an oath.

2. Private, which two or more take privately. As Jacob to Laban, Genesis 31. 53.
Bodz to Ruth, Ruth 3. 13. and Obadiah to Elijah the Prophet, 1 King. 18. 12.

So also there is an assertory oath, and a promissory oath.

1. An assertory oath, or a confirming oath, which is to confirm the truth of a
thing either past or present.

2. A promissory oath, which is about a thing to come.

So we see that an oath is, the calling of the name of God (the searcher of the
heart) to witness a needful truth, for the ending of strife and controversies.
In a lawful oath, lawfully taken, there is a worshipping of the name of God.
When Joshua would cause Achan to confess the truth, he says to him, My Son,
Josh. 7. 19.
give glory to the God of Israel, etc. meaning thereby, that God is highly
dishonored, if a man swear falsely by Him. For he does in a manner, as much as
lies in him, profane and pollute God's holy name with a lie: and on the
contrary, if a man swears truly, he honors God. False swearing is called
profaning the name of God. Ye shall not swear by My name falsely; neither ^ev^
19. 12.
shall thou profane the name of the Lord thy God: I am the Lord. This manner
of Joshuah's speech was used among the Jems, so often as any was called to take
an oath; as it appears by the like protestation of the Pharisees used to the
blind man whom Christ had restored to sight, they said to him, Give God the
Joh. 9. 24.
praise, we know this man is a sinner.

To this heedfulness, the forms of oaths used in the Scriptures, do advise and
instruct us. As the Lord lives; God do so 1 Samuel 14. 39. 44.
to me and more also, 2 Kings 6. 31. And the Lord be witness upon my soul. 2
Cor. 1. 23.


All which do prove, that we cannot call God to witness of our sayings, but
that we call Him to take witness of our perjury, if we speak falsely or
deceitfully.

The name of God is made vile and common, when it is used in superfluous
speeches, as in foolish admirations, which is a manifest taking of God's name
in vain.

Swearing was suffered and ordained, not for lust or pleasure, but for
necessity sake. And there can be no necessity pretended, but where it is to
serve either religion or charity.

But now it is so licentiously and customarily used, that men think it no sin
at all.

But the Commandment of the Lord remains still in force, the penalty abides
in strength, and shall one day have its effect, whereby there is a special
revenge proclaimed against all those who take God's name in vain; though they
may here escape for a time the judgment of men.

The very Heathens will condemn herein, those who are outwardly pro^essed
Christians: for among the Heathen ( ex animi sui sententia, according to the
purpose of their mind) was to them instead of an oath. Did they (who had but
the glimmering knowledge of God from the book of the Creatures, and the Law of
Nature written in their hearts) do such things, and show such truth and reality
in their speeches and dealings? How shall this rise up in judgment against us
and condemn us, who have the written Word of God, the knowledge of the true
God, and the glorious Gospel of his Son shining as a light among us, and yet to
do such things? whereas the Heathen sit in darkness, and in the region and
shadow of Mat. 14. 16*
death. Thus far about the taking of an oath; now,

Q. 2. How an oath is to be performed?

A. If the oath be made about lawful things, it must be performed, whether it
be of much difficulty, or great damage to us, or extorted by force from us. So
it is said, he shall dwell in God's tabernacle, that swears to his Psalm. 15.
4.
own hurt, and changes not. Yet the Magistrate has in his power, as may seem
right and convenient, either to annihilate or moderate such oaths. But of this
we shall treat farther anon.

An oath, in Scripture sometimes is taken for the whole Worship and Service of
God. Thou shall fear the Lord Deuteronomy. 10. 20*
thy God, Him shall thou serve, and swear by His name. And five Cities in the
Isai. 19. 18.
land of Egypt shall speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the Lord of
hosts. and 45. ^3.
I have sworn by My self, said the Lord, that unto me every knee shall bow, and
every tongue shall swear: out of which place the Apostle quoteth that memorable
place, That at the name of Jesus, Phill. 2. 10, 11.
every knee should bow, etc. And that every tongue should confess that Jesus
Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father; and many other places.

If by swearing the whole worship of God is meant, then certainly they that
addict themselves to customary, rash, as well as false swearing, want both
Religion and Conscience.

Q. Is it lawful for Christians to swear? or take an oath, I mean when they are
lawfully called thereunto?

A. It is lawful for us to swear by the name of God, when the Magistrate
commands it, or urgent necessity requires it; and that for these four Reasons.

1. That the glory of God may be manifested: for the truth, and the clearing of
the truth brings glory to God.

2. That we may thereby provide for the safety of others.

3. Because by the Scripture it is evident that we may take a lawful oath. Thou
shall fear the Lord thy God, and Deuteronomy. 6. 13.
serve Him, and swear by His name.

4. We have the examples of former Saints for doing of it.

Mat. 5. 34. Jam. 5. 12.

I answer, 1. Christ came not to dissolve Solution.
the Law, but to fulfill it; that is, Mat. 5. 17.
the Moral Law, to which an oath belongs, for an oath is of the Law of nature,
and of the Moral Law, which is not abrogated by the coming of Christ: and
therefore is not taken away by Christ.

2. Because it concerns the honor of God, and love to our neighbor.

3. Because we have laudable examples of oaths taken even in the New Testament.
Christ Himself very often used the form of an oath to confirm His Doctrine by:
Verily, verily, I say unto Mat. 5. 18. Joh. 3. 5. 11, etc.
you, etc. And the Apostle Paul, he says, God is my witness, whom I serve in
my spirit, etc. And 2 Cor. 1. 23. (where is Romans 1. 9.
the just form of an oath, and whence we took our definition of an oath) I call
2 Cor. 1. 23.
God to record, or witness, upon my soul, etc. where he invokes the witness of
God, to preserve and keep him in swearing that which is right, and to punish
him if he does lie. Athanasius made a solemn oath to purge himself, when he was
accused to the Emperor. An oath is therefore ordained of God, that it should be
a bond of truth among men, and a testimony that God is the author and defender
of truth. So the Apostle says, I speak the truth in Christ, Romans 9. 1.
I lie not; my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost: And so in
another place, God is my record, how greatly Phill. 1. 8.
I love you, etc. and in many other places.

So the Angel lifted up his hand to Rev. 10. 5, 6.
heaven, and swear by Him that lives for ever and ever, etc.

4. The Moral worship of God is perpetual: a lawful oath is Moral worship
(because it is an invocation: of God:) therefore it is perpetual.

5. The Prophets describing the worship of God in the times of the New
Testament, call an oath by the name of God: He that swears in the earth,
Isai. 65. 16.
shall swear by the God of truth. And so in other places.

6. From the end of an oath; which is the confirming of faith and truth, and
for the deciding of strifes and controversies, both in Church and Commonwealth:
So an oath is profitable, lawful, and necessary.

And by all these reasons and arguments we see clearly, that whereas our
Savior said, Swear not at all, etc. and Mat. 5. 34.
Saint James, Above all things swear Jam. 5. 12.
not, etc. that only rash, false, and unnecessary oaths are there forbidden.

Q. By whom must we swear?

A. By the name of the true God alone; for these reasons,

1. For as God alone is to be feared and worshipped, so He alone is to be Deuteronomy.
10. 20.
sworn by.

2. God expressly forbids us to swear by any other name. Make no Exodus 23. 13.
mention of the name of other Gods.

3. The Lord will have the worship of invocation to be given to none other but
to Himself. O thou that hear Prayers, Psalm.
to Thee alone shall all flesh come. Now an oath is an invocation of God.

4. An oath attributes to him by whom we swear, knowledge of the heart,
omniscience, omnipresence, etc. which are proper only to God alone.

5. To Him by whom we swear is deferred the execution of punishment, and
omnipotency, by which He defends the truth, and punishes those that swear
vainly or wickedly, and are perjured: But God alone is Almighty, and He that
executes vengeance; and therefore said our Savior, Fear Him who can cast both
soul and body into Mat. 10. 28.
hell.

Q. About what things may we take an oath?

A. Those only are lawful oaths, which are not contrariant to the Word of God;
and which are taken about things true, certainly known, lawful, in our own
power to perform, weighty matters, necessary, profitable, and worthy things.
And oaths taken about any things contrary to either of these, are unlawful: as
of false things, and not certainly known, unlawful, not in our power, etc.

Q. Whether all oaths are to be kept?

A. An oath rightly taken, about lawful things, true, certain, weighty, and in
our power are necessarily to be kept: But oaths about unlawful things, whether
through error, or through weakness, and against Conscience, such oaths are not
to be kept; but we are to be humbled for them. For he that keeps an unlawful
oath twice sins; as, 1. By swearing evilly. 2. By observing that which he
has wickedly sworn.

Q. Whether extorted or enforced oaths are to be kept?

A. They are to be kept, if they contain nothing unlawful; and if they have
those conditions formerly set down, as true, known, lawful, etc. although those
oaths be unprofitable and hurtful to our selves. But if any oaths be extorted
or drawn from us, through fear, and weakness, and against conscience, they do
not oblige, but are to be retracted. For what is wicked to be done, is wicked
also to be sworn; and we must not add sin to sin.

But extorted oaths if they be not wicked and impious, about lawful things, and
things in our own power, although difficult and hurtful to us; yet are to be
observed. For that which is lawful to do, is lawful to swear; and that which is
lawful to swear, is lawful to do.

Q. But God is said in Scripture frequently, for to swear?

A. God frequently adds an oath to His promises, but seldom to His
threatenings; which should make us to acknowledge the great good will of God to
men, and His bearing with our infirmities. He knows our incredulity and aptness
to doubt of His promises, especially when we are under afflictions and
temptations. Therefore He vouchsafes so far to condescend to our infirmities,
that He joins the sanctity of an oath to confirm and strengthen us. Wherein God
Heb. 6. 17, 18.
willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of promise, the immutability of
His counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two immutable things, (viz. His
word, and oath) in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a
strong consolation, etc.

Q. But since an oath is an invocation of God, by which He is prayed to pre^erve
him that speaks the truth; and to punish him that falsifyeth it; how can an
oath fall on God, because there is none that He can wish to be punished by, if
He deceives.

A. That desinition of an oath agrees with the creature, and not with the
Creator. That it may agree with both the Creator and the creature, we must
define an oath more largely; namely an obliging of himself to punishment, if
wittingly he does deceive. To swear therefore by another, is to acknowledge and
set him as the knower and revenger of perjury, and to oblige himself, to bear
punishment inflicted by him; that is, to the loss of soul or body, or life, or
goods, or honor, if he does not so intend and mean as he speaks.

And therefore they that sweat by creatures, commit idolatry.

Men can oblige themselves to bear punishment from men, if they keep not their
promise: but to swear by any, except by God, cannot be without Idolatry, and
Sacrilege to the honor of God. For they make him by whom they swear, the
knower of their hearts, a witness of their mind and will, and a judge and
revenger of perjury.

Therefore it is said, Men truly swear ^^^. 6.
by the greater, and an oath given for confirmation is to them an end of all
strife: but when God made promise to Abraham, because He could swear by none
greater, He swear by Himself, etc. Men have a higher and greater than they, who
can bring them to punishment whether they will or no: however they may deceive
men, and either by force or fraud escape their judgment.

Therefore when the truth can be found out no way else, then we have recourse
to an oath. Because men judge by natural consent, that he that takes an oath is
not so profane and wicked a wretch, of such desperate audaciousness and
impudency, and so prodigal of his own Salvation, that of his own accord he
would provoke God to punish and plague him: or to think if he lies, that he
shall escape unpunished.

But God has none greater than Himself, that is conscious to, or a witness 1
Cor. 2. 11. Job 9. 12.
of His secret will, or able to punish Him if He says or thinks otherwise.
Therefore God swears by Himself; that is, He obliges Himself, and gives Himself
this Law, that if He deceives, and is not found to do, that is, not seriously
to will what He says He wills, let Him then be accounted and declared by all
His creatures to be vain, a lier, changeable, weak, or unjust, which is, not to
be God. But there is an unutterable zeal in God of His glory, for which He
created all things.

Here we may see as the wonderful great and inexpressible compassion of God
toward men, in respect of our weakness and diffidence, to confirm His Divine
truth and promises to us by an oath; and what a horrid wickedness it is, not to
believe God when He swears to us. For God by His oath, lays His glory as it
were to pawn unto us, obliging Himself voluntarily to suffer the loss of His
glory, if he does not perform His promises.

Therefore in the same sense, the Scripture Genesis 22. 16. Isai. 45. 23.
says, that God swear by Himself; By my Self have I sworn, says the Lord,
etc. I have sworn by my Self, etc. And that God swear by His holiness, Psalm.
89. 39, Once have I sworn by my holiness, etc. So Hos. 4. 2, The Lord has
sworn by his holiness, etc. And we read also, that God swear by his right hand,
Isai. 62. 8.
and by the arm of his strength: and by Je^. 44. 26.
his great name; And by his soul or his life, Isai. 49. 18. As I live, says
the Lord, and 22. 24.
Ezekiel. 5. 11. and 14. 16, etc.

His heart is harder than the nethermilstone, and a self-condemned person, who
does not believe God when He thus swears.

Hence may we gather how much comfort may accrue to all those pious souls, who
suffer affliction from their enemies, for the testimony of a good Conscience,
and for bearing witness to the truth. If God so solidly and faithfully has
fulfilled whatsoever He spoke of His delivering His people from temporal and
corporal afflictions, how much more from hell and everlasting damnation, from
which we are redeemed by the blood of His only-begotten Son?

Now I will only set down what is required in the third Commandment, and so
close up this discourse, though much more might have been written.

In the third Commandment is required, Mat. 6. 9. Psalm. 111. 9.
that we sanctify God's name as it is holy and reverend; and labor by all we
can, to extol and lift it up; that others may be moved by us, more to love,
serve, and honor him. That we use God's titles and proper names as Jehovah,
Jesus, etc. His properties and attributes, His works and actions, His Word,
Sacraments, Prayer, the whole Worship of God, with all reverence and
circumspection; to such uses as they are appointed by God. In a word, that we
have a careful watch to all things that may advance God's glory, and use all
sincere and diligent behavior therein. And to take heed of swearing falsely,
superstitiously, or profanely; Lest God swear in his wrath, that we shall
never Heb. 3. 11.
enter into his rest.

Six Corollaries.
1. Let us be humbled for all our ungodly and unsavory words and speeches, and
for our irreverend use of Gods holy name, His attributes, word, works, and of
all His holy ordinances; that we have not so sanctified Him therein, as we
ought, and as He requires Levit. 10. 3.
of us.

2. Let us bewail and lament the great dishonor done to God, in profaning of
His holy name by the oaths, cursings, and execrations of others; as the Land
mourns for them* let us mourn also. As Lots righteous soul was vexed from day
to day, as with seeing the wicked deeds of ^^^ Sodomites, so with hearing their
2 Pet. 2. 8.
^ilthy and ungodly speeches. Like David also, who said, my tears have been my
meat day and night, while they daily say Psalm. 42. 3. Ezekiel. 9. 4.
unto me where is thy God? That the Lord may remember us for good, and mark us
out for mercy, when we mourn and sigh, and cry out for all the abominations
which are done in the Land. It is not enough for us to refrain from those
abominations, but we must also be truly humbled for them; and that because of
the great dishonor, redounding to God thereby.

3. Speak not of God but with fear and reverence, and as in His sight and
hearing; for there is not a word in our Psalm. 139. 4.
mouths, but he knows it altogether. Seeing we are unworthy to take God's holy
name in our mouths, much less ought we to abuse it vainly and lightly in our
speeches: But to abuse it in vain, rash, or false oaths, is an undoubted sign
of one that has no fear of God before his eyes. They shall make their own
tongue Psalm. 64. 8. Hos. 7. 16.
to fall upon themselves: they shall fall for the rage of their tongue. So the
Prophet complains, Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen, because their
tongue and Isai. 3. 8.
their doings are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his glory.

4. Let our speeches be always gracious, seasoned with the salt of wisdom and
discretion, such as may edify, or Col^. 4. 6.
Minister Grace to the hearers. Let no corrupt communication proceed out of our
Ephesians. 4. 29.
mouths, but that which is good, etc. for 1 Cor. 15. 33.
evil communications corrupt good manners.

5. Pray to God in the words of David, Set thou a watch, O Lord, before Psalm.
141. 3.
my mouth, and keep the door of my lips etc. and let us take heed to our ways,
Psalm. 39. 1.
that we sin not with our tongue; and keep our mouth as with a bridle. For
whosoever keeps his mouth and his tongue* keeps his soul from trouble. For, he
that loves Prove* 21. 23. 1 Pet. 3. 10.
life, and would see good days, must refrain his tongue from evil; and his lips
that they speak no guile.

6. Consider wherefore God gave thee a tongue, and the organs of speech? thou
art not so brutish as to think it was to curse and swear, and blaspheme his
name: No, no, know assuredly that the tongue is the glory of a man; and so
David calls it and faith, awake my glory, Psalm. 57. 8.
I my self will awake early to praise the Lord. And so in another place, Thou
have showed such mercies to me, to the end and 30. 1^.
that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent, etc.

They that use their tongues to God's dishonor, and refuse to praise him with
their tongues here, shall never sing Hallelujahs hereafter; but shall gnaw
their Rev. 16. 10.
tongues for pain, because of their pains, and that for ever, where the worm
dies not, and the fire never goes out.

I might farther speak here of the government of the tongue, which contains
two parts. 1. Holy speech. 2. Holy silence.

In Holy speech, must be considered, 1. The matter of our speech. 2. The manner
of it; But I shall be too prolix, and expatiate too far, to insist particularly
on these, and the several branches thereof. I shall close up this discourse
with these Sentences;

The lips of the righteous know what is Prove. 10. 32.
acceptable; but the mouth of the wicked speaks frowardness.

He that keeps his mouth, keeps his and 13. 3:
life: but he that opens wide his lips, shall have destruction.

Whosoever keeps his mouth and tongue, and 21. 23.
keeps his soul from evil.

The breach of this third Commandment is very heinous, and so much the more, as
the glory of God is most dear and precious to Him. And good reason, for if
sinful men regard their reputation, ought not God much more respect His honor
and glory?

The punishment God threatens, i^ not to hold the party offending guiltless;
that is, faultless. And though no^ particular punishment should follow, yet
impunity is punishment enough. God is greatly angry, when He corrects not.
And an hardened heart is punishment enough. So a man may be grievously punished,
and yet not feel it.

Besides, in this threatening, no time is affixed, that offenders may fear
always* for suddenly oft-times God comes an^ shows His vengeance on such
wicked persons, as we have many examples. No kind of punishment is named, that
they may look for all. There is no exception of persons, every one so offending
shall be punished and plagued.

EXERCITATION THE NINTH.
Exodus 8. 32. And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also.
IT is a fearful thing for any man to harden his heart against God: Who ever
hardened himself against God, and Job 9. 4.
has prospered? Pharaoh first presumptuously and wickedly hardened his own
heart; then the Lord judicially hardened his heart, and gave him over to
hardness of heart. Though he had those ten direful Plagues upon his Land;
though the Egyptians his own people cried out to him to let Israel go, urging
to him, Do thou not know that all the Exodus 10. 7.
land of Egypt is destroyed? yet still he hardened his heart. Like other wicked
men, who after their hardness and impenitency of heart, treasure up unto Romans
2. 5.
themselves wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous
judgments of God. The plague of hardening of his heart, was a greater plague
than all the ten plagues of Egypt. For so obdurate and desperately hardened was
his heart, that although he had let the people of Israel go, and had had all
those ten plagues on him, and on his Land; yet he pursued after them with all
his Host, Chariots, Horses and Horsemen, even into the midst of the red sea,
and there they were all drowned; there remained not so much as one of them.
Like as they made their hearts Exodus 14. 28.
harder than the nether millstone, as it is spoken of Leviathan; so they all
sank Job 41. 24. Exodus 15. 10.
as a stone or lead in those mighty waters. Thus God brake the heads of
Leviathan in pieces ( viz. Pharaoh and all his host) and gave them to be meat
Psalm. 74. 14.
to His people, inhabiting the wilderness. The meaning whereof is, not as some
(though pious and learned, and the Septuagint also) do too too grossly interpret
it, to the wild beasts, which devoured the Egyptians carcasses that were cast
upon the shore: but the meaning is, that God overthrew Pharaoh and his host in
the red sea, and gave them to meat to His people of Israel in their
wilderness-condition, for their souls to feed on by faith; to consider God's
signal miraculous preservation of them, and deliverance of them out of Egypt,
and from those mighty Leviathans who would have swallowed them up, and
destroyed them: and so to strengthen their faith in an experimental way, that
God would still go along with them, keep and preserve them, subdue the
Canaanites before them, and settle them in that Land for a possession, as He
had sworn to their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice? I know not the
Lord. But God said, the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord; when I have
gotten Me honor upon Pharaoh, upon Exodus 14. 18.
his chariots, and upon his horsemen. Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they
will not see; but they shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at Thy people;
Isai. 26. 11.
yea, the sire of thine enemies shall devour them. For the Scripture says of
Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show My
power in thee, and that My name Romans 9. 17.
might be declared in all the earth.

So Sihon King of Heshbon, (though probably he had heard of the wonders God had
wrought for Israel) he would not let the people pass by him; for the Lord
hardened his Spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him
into the hand of Israel; who smo^e him, his sons, and all his people, until
Numb. 21. 35.
there was none left him alive, and they possessed his Land.

So Nebuchadnezar, when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in
pride, he was deposed from his kingly Dan. 5. 20, 21.
throne, and they took his glory from him; and he was driven from the sons of
men, and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild
asses; they fed him with grass like oxen, etc.

And thou his son, O Beshazzar, have not humbled thine heart, though thou Dan.
5. 22. 23. 30.
knew all this; but have lifted up thy self against the Lord of heaven, etc.
and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, have thou
not honored: in that same night he was slain.

What became of the Jews, who hardened their hearts against the preaching of
Christ and His Apostles? God gave them over to hardness of heart, and
impenitency, etc. those spiritual plagues, and followed them so with His
temporal judgments also, until His wrath came 1 Thessalonians. 2. 16.
upon them even to the utmost. This St. Paul then spoke in a way of Prophecy;
for he writ these Epistles to the Thessalonians from Athens, about the 13th
year of Claudius Caesar, which was about 22 years after Christ Crucified; and
Jerusalem was not destroyed by Titus Vesp^sian until some years after; for some
place it in the 40th year, but the most Authentic in the 38th year after
Christ was Crucified: when in the Siege were slain Eleven hundred thousand; in
the war taken Captives Ninety seven thousand, besides many millions that
perished in silence: Thus perished those wicked hardened Jews, as they had
wished that Christ's blood might be on them, and on their children; and so it
has rested Mat. 27. 25.
heavily for above these Sixteen hundred years, and they are as vagabonds on
the earth still. (...) no more of this.

To harden the heart may have reference,

1. To God; which is, when He leaves a man in his natural hardness, not
softning his heart; but as a just Judge delivering him over to Satan, to be
more hardened; thus God hardened Pharaoh's Exodus 9: 12.
heart.

2. To Satan; to inspire blind thoughts, and so to make the heart of a man more
hard.

3. To a man's Self; to follow his own lusts stubbornly: thus Pharaoh hardened
his heart. So at last such a man has a stony heart, which is an extreme
hardness of man's wit and heart, with stubbornness resisting God's will. Thus a
man comes to a hard heart; which is a disobedient and unyielding heart, a heart
Romans 2. 5. Heb. 3. 13.
that cannot repent; which the Apostle bids them beware of, lest their heart be
made hard through the deceitfulness of Isai. 48. 4. Zech. 7. 12.
sin. This is the br^sen forehead, the iron sinew, the stony heart, the heart
of Adamant, (spoken of in Scripture) which nothing can bow or break; neither
promises nor threatenings; blessings nor afflictions. Unto this estate men come
by long custom in sin; custom of sin brings hardness of heart. Well does holy
David therefore pray to God, to Psalm. 139. 24. 119. 101. 104.
deliver him from every way of wickedness; that he might not make wickedness
his trade, his customary way to walk in, as too too many do.

This hardness of heart comes as I said before,

1. By the just judgment of God.

2. By the malice of Satan.

3. By a man's own perverse will.

This the Apostle fully describes; They Ephesians. 4. 18, 19:
walk in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkened, being
alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, because
of the hardness of their heart: who being past feeling, have given themselves
over into lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. I translate
it (the hardness of their heart) for the word in the Original ((...)) signifies
induration or hardening, (although rendered in our translation, according to
the blindness of their heart). Whereas the word (...) which is from (...),
callum Joh. 12. 40.
obduco, obduro, is rendered, He has hardened their hearts, and both words
come from the same word in the Original. So from these words we see in what
consists this alienation or estranging from God, namely, in the darkness of the
understanding, and the untamed malice of the heart, being deprived of God's
Spirit and Grace (being given over to a reprobate mind, i. e. to a mind void of
judgment; or God took from them the light of right reason; (for all Romans 1. 28.
these the word ((...)) signifies in the Original.) they are wilfully ignorant,
obstinately refusing the light of God which is offered them. Who being past
feeling, having lost all remorse of Conscience, all fear of God's judgments,
and likewise all just feeling of their punishments, have deaded their
Conscience, that they may not be stayed from doing evil by God's judgments: And
this is the last degree and fullness of the said alienation from God; by which a
man is not only destitute of God's light and power to do well; but also shakes
off the only curb he had to keep him from doing evil, which is his Conscience:
And so he brings himself to a seared Conscience, to have his Conscience seared
as with a hot iron; that has lost 1 Timothy 4. 2*
all manner of feeling, and motion of Conscience; as a cautery or searing iron,
applied to any part of the body, deadens it, and makes it insensible. For
Conscience is a Judge and a Witness (unless it be deadned); the Conscience is
but a correspondency and relation of man's spirit unto the Law; either to bind
or unbind him, to accuse or excuse him, to condemn or absolve him.

Wherefore seeing the Heathen have a Conscience, they have also a Law; which
leaves them without excuse at the great day of Judgment; though they have not
the light of the glorious Gospel shining among them, (as blessed be God we
have.) Let us strive to keep Conscience awake, while we are here in this life,
and not to muzzle its mouth, then it will either accuse or excuse us: but if it
be deadned here, at the great day of judgment, when the books shall Rev. 20. 12.
be opened; that is, men's Consciences, or the records and testimonies of every
man's Conscience, being unfolded and manifested through the mighty power of
God; wherein as in books are written all men's thoughts, words and works, then
Conscience will speak and not be dumb, and thou shall be judged out of those
things which are written in those books: yea, if thou stiflest the mouth of
Conscience here, thy Conscience as ten thosand witnesses will fly in thy face,
for ever hereafter; where the worm never Isai. 66. 24. Mark 9. 44.
dies: where that worm of Conscience will for ever gnaw upon thine heart, in
the fire that never goes out. Then the Lord will be known by the judgments
Psalm. 9. 16.
which He executes, and the wicked shall be snared in the works of their own
hands. Oh that dreadful expression, the Lord said by Moses unto Pharaoh, Exodus
9. 14.
I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy
servants, and upon thy people. And in the next Chapter, I have hardened his
heart, and Exodus 10. 1.
the heart of his servants. These spiritual judgments are of all others the
most fearful and terrible, that can befall a man or woman in this life; As 1.
Blindness of mind. 2. Hardness of heart. 3. Searedness of Conscience; for these
are the dreadful forerunners of hell.

Let us therefore hearken to the checks of Conscience, and not stifle them; and
labor we to have our hearts sprinkled Heb. 10. 22.
from an evil Conscience, that is, from the inward impurity and defilements of
corruption, whereof every man's Conscience is a witness and judge. And strive
we also to have the answer of a 1 Pet. 3. 21.
good conscience toward God. The meaning of the Apostle there is, of the
inward baptism or washing, wrought by the power of the Holy Ghost, whereby a
believers Conscience is in such manner eased, acquitted, and purified; that it
being tried and questioned before God, it answers and witnesses to it self in
the name of the Holy Ghost, Pardon, Grace, and Peace; which is Romans 8. 16.
which is unto such a soul a foundation pledge and assurance of everlasting
Salvation. As the former were the pledges and assurances of everlasting
damnation.

Despair is that which follows from an evil Conscience, and obstinate contempt
of God, and is the greatest part of punishment and evil, which wicked men
suffer.

Conscience may be thus described, (though there be other definitions of it.) A
power and faculty of the Soul, taking knowledge, and bearing witness of all a
man's thoughts, words, and actions; and accordingly excusing or accusing,
absolving or condemning, comforting or tormenting of the same.

Conscience is God's Notary and there is nothing passes in our whole life,
whether good or evil, which Conscience notes not down with an indeleble
Character, which nothing can raze out but Christ's blood alone.

Conscience writes men's sins as with a pen of Iron, and with the point of a
Diamond, and they are graven upon the table of their hearts: Their conscience
Jer. 17. 1.
also bearing witness, etc. In the day when Romans 2. 15, 16.
God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.

Conscience (I say) is exact and punctual in setting down the particulars of a
man's whole life; that it may be a faithful witness either for him, or against
him at the last day. Our transgressions Isai. 59. 12.
are multiplied before Thee, and our sins testify against us; for our
transgressions are with us, and as for our sins we know them.

A hard heart is not rent by compunction, Bernard.
nor mollified by Piety, nor moved by entreaties, yields not unto
threatenings, is hardened by corrections, is ungrateful for benefits, will not
hearken to good counsel, cruel to revenge, immodest in regard of shameful
things, not dismayed with dangers, inhumane in humane things, r^sh in Divine
things, forgetting things past, neglecting present things, not providing for
future; that is, which remembers nothing past, but only injuries to revenge
them, etc.

Q. How may we understand this that is said in several places, Pharaoh hardened
Exodus 4. 21*
his heart; and God said, I have hardened Pharaohs heart; and the Lord and 9.
12.
hardened Pharaohs heart; if God hardened his heart, how did he do it himself?

A. God works two ways in the hearts of wicked men.

1. By withholding His Grace, whereby they might be moved unto good; as when
light is taken away, there remains nothing but darkness and blindness; when
God's Spirit is taken away, then men's hearts become hard as stones; when God's
direction cease, then men's hearts are turned aside into crookedness and
perverseness: so it is said, that God does blind, harden, and bow them, from
whom He takes away the power to see and to do that which is right.

2. By using the Ministry of Satan, to stir up, frame, and incline their
wills. God for the executing of His judgments by Satan the Minister of His
wrath, both appoints the purposes of wicked men to what end it pleases Him;
and stirs up their wills, and strengthens their endeavors.

So Sihon King of Heshbon (as we said Deuteronomy. 2. 30.
before) did not let Israel pass by him, because the Lord hardened his spirit,
and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into the hand of
Israel. Therefore because it was God's Will to have him destroyed, the making
of his heart hard and obstinate, was God's preparing him for his destruction.
So God hardened Pharaoh's heart; that is, not only in not sustaining it, but
also in committing his heart to Satan to be confirmed with obstinacy.

So God turned their hearts to hate His Psalm. 105. 25.
people, etc. And it was the Lord that hardened the heart of Pharaoh and his
servants to pursue after Israel, that He Exodus 14. 4.
might be honored upon Pharaoh, etc.

God hardened Pharaoh's heart, not that He did set and imprint hardness in his
heart; but because by sundry actions He ordered and governed His wicked will.
And they are four:

1. God permitted Pharaoh to walk after his own will.

2. He left him to the malice of the Devil, and the lusts of his own heart.

3. He urges him with a Commandment, to let the people go: and Pharaoh the
more he is urged, the stiffe^ and more stubborn he is, and the more he re^els
against God.

4. God uses the hardness of Pharaoh's heart, to the manifestation of His own
justice and judgment: and so opened to him a way, that he might run headlong
to his own utter ruin and destruction.

So God confounds his implacable enemies two ways here.

1. By hardness of heart; which arises (as we said before) when God
with-draweth His Grace from a man, and leaves him to himself; so as he goes
on from sin to sin, and never repents to the last gasp. And we must esteem of
it as a most fearful and terrible judgment of God: for when the heart is
possessed therewith, it becomes so flinty and rebellious, that a man will never
relent or turn to God. This was manifest in Pharaoh; for though God sent most
grievous plagues upon him, and all the Land of Egypt, yet would he not submit,
or humble himself, save only for a fit, while the hand of God was so heavy upon
him; for when the hand of God was removed, he returned to his former obstinacy,
wherein he persisted until he was drowned in the red Sea. And this judgment of
God, (of hardness of heart) is the more fearful, because when a man is in the
midst of all misery, he feels no misery.

2. God confounds His enemies, as by hardness of heart, so by final
desperation: I say final; because all kind of desperation is not evil; for a
man may despair of himself, and of his own power in the matter of Salvation,
which tends to his everlasting comfort. But final desperation is, when a man
utterly despairs of the pardon of his sins, and of everlasting life. Examples
we have in Saul that slew himself, in Achitophel and Judas that hanged
themselves, etc.

This sin of desperation is caused thus; so many sins as thou committest
without repentance, so many wounds thou give to thine own soul: and in life
or death God will make thee to feel the smart of it, and the weight of them
all; whereby the soul sinks down to the gulf of despair, without recovery.

The sins which thou committest, lie at the door of thy heart, though thou feel
them not; (as God said unto Cain Genesis 4. 7.
sin lies at the door) and if thou do not prevent them, by speedy, and
timely repentance, God will make thee to feel them once before thou dyest, and
raise up such terrors in thy Conscience, that thou shall think thy self to be
in Hell before thou art there.

They that were sent from the chief Priests, etc. to apprehend Christ, though
He had acknowledged, I am He; and they were astonished and fell to the ground,
and He had miraculously healed Joh. 18. 12.
Malchus his ear; yet for all, though they had seen his wonderful power, both
in word and deed; they proceed in malice against Him, and bind Him as a
Malefactor. In this we note, what a fearful sin hardness of heart is. The
danger whereof appears in this, that if a man be possessed with it, there is
nothing that can stay or daunt him in his wicked proceedings, no, not the
powerful words and deeds of our Savior Himself. And indeed among all God's
judgments there is none more fearful than this of hardness of heart; and yet
how rife is it among us even in these our days? For it is very evident, that
the more men are taught the Doctrine of Gods Law and Gospel, the more hard and
senseless are their hearts: like unto an anvil, the more it is beaten upon with
the iron hammer, the harder it is. So that that denunciation against the Jews,
Acts 28. 26, 27. is fulfilled in them. It is such a terrible judgment of God,
into which when a man is fallen, he feels neither pain nor grief. Therefore we
have cause with fear and trembling to look into it, lest it take such hold of
us, that we be past all hopes of recovery. Sin is a deceitful thing; and custom
in sin brings hardness of heart; therefore read that Heb. 3. 13. and Romans 2. 5.
Let us bewail and be humbled for our hardness of heart, whereby we are hindered
from knowing and acknowledging God aright, and from discerning His glory and
Majesty; from acknowledging God's judgments, or our own sins; dreaming we are
safe from God's vengeance, and such perils and miseries which arise from sin:
whereas all those out of Christ, and in this estate, have nothing stands
between them and vengeance.

EXERCITATION THE TENTH.
Exodus 31. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Verily my Sabbath ye shall keep: for it is a
sign between Me and you, throughout your generations; that ye may know, that I
am the Lord that does sanctify you. Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for
it is holy unto you; every one that defiles it, shall surely be put to death:
for whosoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his
people. Six days may work be done, but in the seventh is the Sabbath of rest,
holiness to the Lord. Whosoever does any work in the Sabbath Day, he shall
surely be put to death. Wherefore the Children of Israel shall keep the
Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath, throughout their generations, for a perpetual
Covenant. It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel for ever: for in
six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh He rested. Exodus
20. 8. Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it holy.
HEre we have the Commandment of God, for the strict observation of the
Sabbath Day. No one Commandment so often iterated, or so much pressed. This
Commandment requires at the hand of every man, one day of seven in every week,
to be set apart unto a holy rest: and requires all persons to separate
themselves from their ordinary labor, and all other exercises, to God's
Service alone, on that day: that so being severed from their worldly
businesses, and all the works of their Labors and Callings concerning this
Nehem. 13. 15. 22.
life, they may wholly attend to the Worship of God alone; wholly to separate
themselves to the Worship and Service of God; that they may with more freedom
of Spirit, perform the same.

If Adam in his perfection, had need of this holy day, (as it was first
enjoined in the state of innocence) much more Genesis 2. 2, 3.
have we. To teach man from time to time, on the Sabbath Day to withdraw
himself from the cares and labors of this life, to apply himself in freedom
and tranquillity of mind, to the meditations and actions of a spiritual life.

Q. But some will say, this fourth Commandment is ceremonial, and so it is
taken away by the death of Christ?

A. I answer, No; but it is constantly and perpetually to be observed,

1. For it is placed in the number of the ten Commandments, which are
perpetual, otherwise the Moral Law should consist but of nine, which is
contrary to God's Word; And He declared unto Deuteronomy. 4. 13.
you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even ten Commandments.

2. Because this fourth Commandment (among the rest, and in the middle of them,
as a Diamond in a ring) was written by the finger of God; whereas Exodus 31. 18.
no part of the ceremonial Law was.

3. It was written in tables of stone, to signify the perpetuity of it.

4. It was before any ceremony of the Law, yea before Christ promised; for it
was instituted in Paradise. Genesis 2. 2, 3.


5. The ceremonies were as a partitionwall betwixt Jews and Gentiles; but God
extends this Commandment, not only to the Jews, but also to strangers. Exodus
20. 10.


Herein, I say, the Moral Law (which is the ten Commandments) is preheminent
above the ceremonial or judicial Law;

1. Because the Moral Law is a foundation of the other Laws, and they are
reducible to it.

2. The Moral Law was to abide always, but not the ceremonial nor judicial.

3. This was immediately written by God, and commanded to be kept in the Ark,
which the others were not. The ceremonial Law was to continue but until Christ
came. The judicial Law Gal. 3. 19.
was for the Jews political estate for the time being. But of the Moral Law it
is spoken, The Lord came from Sinai, with Deuteronomy. 33. 2.
ten thousand of His Saints, from his right hand went a fiery law for them. The
Service and Ministry of the Angels* in promulgating of the Law, makes much to
the honor of the Law; for we never read of a Law enacted by so solemn, sacred,
and august a Senate, as the Moral Law was; where Jesus Christ accompanied with
thousands of Angels was the Speaker, and gave these Precepts. Acts 7. 53. Heb.
2. 2. Psalm. 68. 8.
By how much the more glory God put upon this Moral perpetual Law, the greater
is their sin who derogate from it. I have read a story of Stes^chorus, that
when in some words he had disparaged Helena's beauty, he was stricken with
blindness; but afterward when he praised her again, he obtained his sight. It
may be because some men have not set forth the due excellency of this Moral
Law, God has taken away their eyesight, not to see the beauty of it; but let
them begin with holy David to set forth the excellent benefits* of it, and then
they may see the glory, perpetuity, and morality of it more than ever. How
careful then should men be, that they transgress not this Law, which has so
sacred authority? It was Christ that appeared to Moses in the bush: He is also
called the Acts 7. 35. Isai. 63. 9.
Angel of the Covenant; because He made that Covenant of the Law with the
people on Mount Sinai. And it was no created Angel, for thus He begins, I am
Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt. Well might Paul
then, speaking of the Moral Law, say, It is holy, just, and good. Romans 7. 12.
Away then with those profane opinions, and licentious Doctrines of some,
against the Sabbath Day, which is a taking away of one of the Commandments. The
Sabbath has its morality and perpetuity from the mere positive Commandment of
God. Pardon this digression; and come we to a more practical discourse.

The Sanctification of the Sabbath is, Description.
whereby we rest from labors and outward work, that man, together with his
family and beasts may be refreshed, that the whole day may be spent in the
Worship and Service of God. So there are two parts of this: 1. Rest from
labor. Parts of it.
2. Sanctification of this Rest. To sanctify the Sabbath, is not to make it
holy (so it is already by God's institution) but to separate it from profane
uses, and to devote it to the Worship of God. We must omit upon this day, the
works of our outward temporal Vocation, which must be done in the six days of
the week. But the proper works of the Sabbath are these three*

1. Works of Necessity which are allowed for our bodily sustentation.

2. Works of Charity, both to man and beasts, which can no ways be deferred to
another day: So our Savior, which of you having an Ox or an Ass, Luke 14. 5.
fall into a pit, will not help him out on the Sabbath* day?

3. But especially of works Piety, which are the proper works of the Sabbath;
as to frequent the public Assembly, to read and hear, to meditate and speak of
the Word of God; sing Psalms, receive the Sacrament; to exhort and encourage
each other to Piety* to build up Jude ^0.
each other in our most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, etc. And to
refrain all those things which may hinder, divert, or distract the mind from
the Service of God, and everlasting benefit of our Souls; such as vain
thoughts, idle, worldly, and unsavory speeches, which no ways tend to
edification: pastimes, recreations, and suchlike; which are Isai. 58. 13, 14.
expressly forbidden in the Prophet Isaiah, as some well observe, which may be
explained thus: Turn thy foot from the Sabbath, that is, from spurning at it;
and this is Paraphrased, by not doing our own ways, nor finding our own
pleasure, nor speaking our own words. Herein is the negative Sanctification of
the Sabbath. Affirmatively it consists, as the same Prophet farther goes on,

1. In calling the Sabbath our delight: that is, in a real account of it to be
such, and using it as such; both in desiring it before it comes, and rejoicing
in it when it is come, as a good and joyful day.

2. In calling it the holy of the Lord; that is, by faith to apprehend it to be
of His holy institution, and so set it apart from all other worldly time, to
sanctify it.

3. In calling it honorable, or a glorious day, a portion of time honored
with the name of God stamped upon it, as the day of days, and so accounting and
using of it.

4. In honoring Jehovah herein, by declaring His holiness and goodness in His
Sabbath, setting forth His praise from morning to night. The due sanctifying of
the Sabbath is hedged about with many great and precious promises, both of the
upper and nether springs, Judge. 1. 15.
(heavenly and earthly blessings) to keep men close to their obedience. why
should not these cords of love bind and engage men? They who abhor
Sabbath-performing in duty, drive the Lord from promise-performing in mercy:
bitterness will be to them in the latter end. I have observed, that a serious
strict and conscientious observation of the Sabbath, is the outward greatest
character of an upright and gracious person. The 92 Psalm (entitled a Psalm
for the Sabbath Day) declares, that it is a good thing to begin the day with
Praises to God early in the morning; and continue the same until it be night.

Q. Some will say, this strict observation of the Sabbath, belonged only to the
Jews.

A. Nay, but as the most Reverend Arch* Bishop Usher, and others very well say,
we are bound more strictly to observe these Sabbath-duties, than they were; and
that because of the greater measures of Gods Graces upon us, than ever were
given unto them.

Q. But the day is altered; The Jews did and do observe Saturday, because upon
that day God rested from the work of Creation; which now is changed into the
first day of the week?

A. This was done, not by humane but by Divine authority: which appears by the
practice of Christ and the Apostles: Jo^. 20. 19. 26. and 20. 7.
which should be a sufficient rule to us; especially because the Apostles have
added a Commandment thereunto. And 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2.
there is no other reason, but in regard of the Lord Christ's special
institution, Rev. 1. 10.
why it should be called the Lord's Day; as the Lords Prayer because of His
making; and the Lords Supper is so also 1 Cor. 11: 2^*
called, because it was of Christ's immediate institution: therefore there is
no special mention made of it in the New Testament, because there was no
question made at all of this change in the Apostles time, it was so commonly
known; and another reason which I imagine why it is not mentioned in the New
Testament? not to deter the Jews from coming into the Church; for we read in
several places of the Acts of the Apostles, how much and how far they Acts 15.
29. and 21. 24.
condescended to the Jews, to win them to Christ. So this day is specially
dedicated to the Lords service, for otherwise all the days of the week are the
Lords days, and he is to be served and worshipped in them; but on this day
wholly, and more especially. For Christ alone could change the sabbath day, who
is the Lord of the Sabbath. Mat. 12. 8.
Athanasiu^ plainly says, that Christ himself did change the day.

There are many more arguments for the change of the Sabbath, which we read of;
but I spare prolixity. As God rested from the works of Creation, then he
sanctified and blessed the seventh day on which He rested; so it was meet that
our Lord Jesus Christ having finished the work of our Redemption on the Cross,
when He said, It is finished, and Joh. 19. 30.
bowed His head, and gave up the ghost; and rested in the grave, and was
declared to be the Son of God with power, Romans 1. 4.
by His resurrection from the dead: this same day in which Christ rested from
His labor, and the work of our redemption (which was greater than the work of
Creation) this day did He sanctify unto Himself. This day as Christ sanctified
by His resurrection, so by twice Joh. ^^* 19. ^^* Acts 2* ^* ^*
appearing to His Apostles on the same day, and by sending the Holy Ghost upon
them on the same day; which day Acts 20. ^. 1 Cor. 16. ^. Apo^. ^* ^^.
the Apostles observed, and the Churches also.

But in the words at first read, God said that the Sabbath was a sign between
Him and the Children of Israel, therefore some say it is a type, or a ceremony,
or a representation of something to come. We have proved it not to be a
ceremony; but we may well, and will also grant it to be a type or
representation of our heavenly rest, that perpetual Sabbath Heb. 4. 3. 9.
of rest we shall keep there*

But sign signifies here as much as a document; so Christ said, By this shall
Joh. 13. 35.
all men know that ye are My Disciples, if ye love one another.

In the observation of the Lords Day, there is a common and public profession
made of that Communion which is between God and us: So then every solemn
profession is a sign of that thing of which it is a profession; so also the
Sabbath is called a Sign in that common reason.

But some will say, this Sabbath was enjoined only to the Children of Israel,
what is that to us?

This belongs also to the spiritual Israel, and not only to the bodily, which
Romans 9. ^.
were of that lineage by corporal generation. The Jews alone were Israel 1 Cor.
10. 18.
after the flesh; but we also after the spirit: for the believing Gentiles are
called the Israel of God. Gal. 6. 1^.


The word Remember, is prefixed to this fourth Commandment, to show that
although all the Commandments are needful diligently to be observed and
remembered; yet this more especially. The word (Remember) is to put us in mind,
1. Of our natural forgetfulness of this Commandment. 2. Of the excellency and
worth of it. 3. To prepare our selves for the due keeping of it. For we are
naturally most negligent in it, suffering our selves to be withdrawn by our
worldly businesses from the Lords Service upon the Lords day; and therefore
such a special warning is needful to be added: And as to keep it holy when it
is come; so also to prepare our selves for it, and put our hearts, our selves,
in a ready Sabbath Days posture; and to dispose our worldly businesses so, that
if possible we may have no avocation, let, or hinderance on the Lords day.

To speak a little more of the words read at first, in Exodus 31. 13, etc. for
this word Verily, the Septuagint render it, see to it, or look unto it, that ye
keep My Sabbath: then we have the reasons annexed.

1. It is a sign between Me and you, (of which word Sign we have spoken
already.)

2. That ye may know that I am the Lord, that does sanctify you; as ye expect
a Sabbath-blessing, or for Me to instamp My image of holiness upon you, see
that ye keep holy My Sabbath. Observe here also the frequent iterated
injunctions, ye shall keep it holy therefore.

3. It is fenced with such dreadful Comminations, Every one that defiles it,
shall surely be put to death: And whosoever does any work therein, that soul
shall be cut off from amongst his people: And again, he shall surely be put to
death: and more such expressions here are. So then it is not at every man's
liberty if he will observe the Sabbath or no. God as He is faithful in His
promises of mercy, so also in His threatenings of vengeance: Although
Sabbath-prophaners may escape punishment here, God will assuredly (without
great repentance) make them suffer for ever hereafter, for slighting,
neglecting and breaking of His Covenant of the Sabbath. For the breaking of the
Sabbath, is a violation of the whole Worship of God. Woe therefore to those
profane, ungodly Sabbath Breakers, who are also usually addicted to Oaths,
Cursings, and Blasphemies, to Whoredom, Drunkenness, and other notorious
abominations, (for one such heinous sin never goes alone) whose judgment
lingreth 2 Pet. 2. 3.
not, and their damnation slumbreth not.

Woe also to those who idle away the Sabbath; spending it in worldly discourses,
gadding, gazing, idleness, and suchlike, as if the negative part of keeping
the Sabbath ( thou shall do no manner of work) were enough: never looking to
the positive part, to keep it holy, to spend the whole day in God's Service, to
His glory, and for their own spiritual edification and advantage. They that
will not sanctify God's rest here, shall never enter into His rest hereafter.

Now a little to speak farther of the right sanctifying of the Lords day,
summarily, and we have done.

Our care must be overnight, having laid aside all our earthly affairs, to
begin to fit our selves for the Lord's Day, and His Service thereon. Rising as
early or earlier on the Lords day as we do on other days for our own
businesses, (as David said, O Lord thou art my God, Psalm. 63. 1.
early will I seek thee:) when we are dressing our selves, let us have heavenly
thoughts, as to put on the garments of Christ's righteousness, to be as a Bride
trimmed to meet the Bridegroom of our Souls. Then to retire our selves, and
pray to God that He will prepare our hearts aright; for the preparation of the
Psalm. 10. 17. Prove. 16. 1.
heart is from the Lord. That God would enable us for to sanctify His holy
name, in all our duties of worship; for He will be sanctified of all that draw
Levit. 10 3.
near to Him.

Then (if we are governors of families) to call our family together, and
strive to prepare them likewise: so to Psalm. 42. 4. Josh. 24. 15. Acts 16. 14.
Mat. 15. 10.
go to the house of God together; that we and our family may serve the Lord:
Attend diligently to the Word of God; hear and understand; and hear as for our
lives, so to hear as our souls Isai. 55. 3. Deuteronomy. 30. 19.
may live: it is not a vain thing, it is for our lives: take heed also, be not
forgetful hearers of the Word, but doers of it, Jam 1. 22.
that we may be blessed in the deed; else we deceive our own souls; and that is
the greatest deceit, and of most dismal consequence. Let us join with the
Congregation in Prayer: Sing with the Spirit, and sing with understanding also.
1 Cor. 14. 15.
If the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper be administered (having duly prepared
ourselves) let us receive it. When the Sacrament of Baptism is administered,
Pray for the party baptized, give thanks to God for adding one member more to
His outward visible Church; and remember we our vow made to God in our Baptism,
to be humbled for the breaking of it, and resolve by God's Grace to perform it
better for the future. And depart not from the Church, before the Minister has
pronounced the blessing. And so let us not turn our backs on any of God's
ordinances.

When we come home, let us feed in fear, and season it with meditation and
speeches of holy things. After Dinner, let us meditate, confer on, and repeat
what we have heard; examine and catechize our families, and strive to make that
we heard to be our own, ruminating upon it; (as those only were clean beasts
under the Law, which did chew Lev. 11. 3.
the cud). Then to return in season to the afternoon Public Worship, and
demean our selves as in the morning. When we return home, then to do as before
we did after dinner: If we are enforced to walk through the fields, then to
contemplate the works of God, His Providence and Mercies. After Supper, to
confer, read, meditate, sing Psalms, instruct, exhort, encourage, etc.

And close the day with Prayer, craving pardon for sin, and for the iniquities
of our holy things; Pray for more Grace, to profit by all we have heard (for it
is God alone that teaches us to profit) and that we may persevere therein Isai.
48. 17.
unto the end: blessing God that has given us one Sabbath Day more; and has
in any measure assisted us in the performance of our duties. Thus sanctifying
the Sabbath, God has made it not only our duty so to do, but also an essential
means of His bestowing Mercies, Blessings, and increase of Grace on us, in this
our religious observation of the same: Thus God blessed the Sabbath Day. Isai.
56. 6, 7.
When we lie down in our beds, examine we our hearts, how we are bettered, what
increase of knowledge and Grace, what strength against corruptions, what
heavenly-mindedness more we have obtained. And so repose our selves to sleep in
the arms of our heavenly Father, having heavenly thoughts in our hearts; that
we may be able comfortably to say, How precious are thy thoughts to me, O God
(that is my thoughts which I have of Thee) how great is the sum of them! when I
awake, Psalm. 139. 17, 18:
I am still with Thee.

Be not weary of Sabbath-duties and exercises; like those wicked Jews, who
said, When will the sabbath be gone, that Amos 8. 5: Mal. 1. 13.
we may go to our worldly businesses? and what a weariness is this? and so
snuffed at it. These men and women are far from tasting how gracious the Lord
is; and from those who by reason of use 1 Pet. 2. 3. Heb. 5. 14.
have their senses exercised, to discern both good and evil. They see no such
excellency and preciousness in Christ, they find no sweetness in His
ordinances, to say with Peter, Lord it is good for us Mat. 17. 4.
to be here: They are far from David's temper, to have their souls to long,
yea, even to faint for the courts of the Lord; Psalm. 84. 1, 2.
and cry out, when shall I come and appear before God? our blessed Savior for
us spent a whole night in Prayer to Luke 6. 12.
God. Heaven will be no Heaven to Rev. 4. 8. 11.
such persons as these; where we shall for ever be praising God. And like as
God rested the seventh day from all His works, Heb. 4. 4. 10.
(as one would say) God did retire Himself, to the quiet enjoyment of Himself,
His glory, and blessedness. So we being by death freed from the works of this
life, from all our labors and to^ls, from all sin and suffering, from all
sorrow and misery, when God shall wipe away ^^v. 7. 17. ^^^. 35. 10.
all tears from our eyes; and sorrow and sighing shall flee away; then shall we
altogether live with God in the perfect rest of glory. For there remains a
rest, or keeping an everlasting Sabbath ^^^. 4. 11.
to the people of God.

Sabbath in Hebrew signifies Cessavit, Addition.
quievit, vacavit; a Sabbath Day is a day of rest. It signifies not such a
rest, as when one sits still and does nothing: but a resting and ceasing
from doing that which he did before. So God called this day a Sabbath, which He
dedicated and consecrated to His own public Worship:

1. Because on that day God rested from His creation of all those new species:
but not from conserving and propagating of them, by the continual generation of
individuals.

2. Because the Sabbath is a representation of that spiritual rest from sin and
of that rest in everlasting life.

3. Because that we must on that day cease from all our secular and worldly
employments; that devoting our selves wholly to God's Worship, He may work His
work upon our hearts, and exercise His works in us.

4. That our Servants and Beasts may rest as well as we. The Church of the Jews
under the Old Testament had various Sabbaths, as of Days, Months, and Years.

1. Their Sabbath of days, every seventh day of the Week: So also their
Sabbaths of days were their other Festivals; as the Feast of Passover,
Pentecost, Tabernacles, Expiation, Trumpets, etc. for in all these Feasts they
were commanded to rest as well as on the Seventh day. Of all these read at
large in Levit. 23. and 25. Chapters.

2. Their Sabbath of Months, every New Mood.

3. Their Sabbath of years, every seventh year, in which they were not to till
the ground, Levit. 25. 8. and I may add hereto the Jubilee, which was once in
seven times seven years, or the 49th year.

The word remember in the Hebrew, signifies to call to mind somewhat before, or
to keep in mind somewhat for after; and sometimes it signifies both, as it may
well here be taken; for this ordinance of God of the Sabbath, was instituted
long before, and was to continue for afterward.

The word Sanctify or hallow, does signify these four things.

1. To make a thing Holy, by putting holiness into it morally.

2. To acknowledge a thing to be Holy.

3. To appoint a thing to Holy and Religious uses.

4. To use things to those good uses whereto they were appointed. This day has
no more Holiness in it, than any other, that for it self it might be accounted
more Holy than other: only God has appointed it to holy uses, and would have
us to use it thereunto. The reasons why God commands us to keep holy this day.

1. God gives us six days to labor in, and has reserved but one in seven for
Himself, therefore good reason is it we should obey.

2. God requires no more, than that which Himself has done, therefore ought
men to do so.

3. God has blessed and hallowed this day to this end. Therefore it must be
kept.

We must spend our strength in sanctifying of the Sabbath, in the duties of of
the day: they that worship God to purpose, spend their bodies and their
strength in nothing so much, as in the worship of God; stirring up themselves
to take hold of God. Jacob wrestled Isai. 64. 7. Genesis 32. 24.
with God in Prayer; now wrestling is a hard exercise, therein men put forth
all their strength. It will be a sad thing another day, when this shall be
charged upon very many, that they have spent their strength upon sin, and upon
their lusts, but never put forth any strength in Holy Duties, or
Sabbath-Performances; there they are as cold and dead as may be: It is a sign
of the breath of life when it is warm, but artificial breath is cold. As the
breath that comes out of a living body is warm, but the breath out of a pair
bellows is cold: So the breath of many people in Prayer, is discovered to be
but artificial breath, it is so cold: but if there were spiritual life, than it
would be warm. There must be strength and heat of affection. So I might
instance in hearing the Word, we must hear as for our lives, Isai. 55. 3.
so hear that our Souls may live, etc. But you will say, the Sabbath is a time
of rest?

I confess it is a time of rest from outward labors, but it is a time of
spending strength in a spiritual way. They that will worship God aright upon
the Sabbath, will find it a spending of a great deal of strength. And blessed
is that strength that is spent in the Worship of God.

EXERCITATION THE ELEVENTH.
Luke 21. 19. In your patience possess ye your Souls.
WE are not able to enjoy our selves, or any of the blessings which God
affords us, without patience. While we are here in this life, let us expect
troubles and afflictions, and discomforts even from our nearest relations,
crosses and losses. It is our blessed Saviors Legacy, in the world ye Joh. 16.
33.
shall have tribulation; and through many afflictions we must enter into the
Kingdom of heaven. Expect them therefore, Acts 14. 22*
and prepare for them; then when they come, they will wound us the less*
Praevisa minus feriunt t^l^. Let us enjoy this present life, and the comforts
thereof, so long as it shall please God to afford them unto us; exercising our
selves in continual patience, and by it enduring all. Behold, we count them
Jam. 5. 11.
happy which endure; we have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the
end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.

Patience is a Christian virtue, whereby Definition.
by faith resting on the Providence, Power, and Goodness of God, we sweetly and
quietly submit our selves to His hand, in all afflictions, which by Him are
sent upon us.

The afflictions of the Godly, are, 1. For Correction. 2. For Trial.

1. For Correction; if we were without chastisement, (whereof all God's Heb.
12. 8. 10, 11.
Children are partakers) then were we bastards and not sons. He chastifeth us
for our profit; and He sees it is needful for us; for a season (if need be) we
1 Pet. 1. 6.
are in heaviness through manifold temptations: So that at length we may say it
is good for us, and we could not have been without it. Though at present no
Psalm. 119. 71.
affliction is joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the quiet fruit
of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby: This is all the fruit, to
take Isai. 27. 9.
away their sin.

2. The afflictions of the Godly, as they are for correction, so also for
trial: to try our faith and other Graces; if we will quietly submit unto God,
and humble our selves under His mighty 1 Pet. 5. 6.
hand: to be dumb with silence, and not open our mouths (that is, in a fretting
and repining way) because Psalm. 39. 8. Micah 6. 9.
God has done it. To hear the rod, and who has appointed it. For the rod of
God has a voice with it, and the man of wisdom will see it, and hear it, and
endeavor to understand the meaning of it, as well as to feel the smart of it.
Affliction arises not out of the dust, neither Job. 5. 6.
does trouble spring out of the ground. Say therefore with the Church, I will
Micah. 7. 9.
bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against Him; when He
has truly tried me, He will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold
His righteousness. Let us not therefore like a dog, snarl at the stone, but
look to the hand that flung it. A sparrow shall not fall to the ground without
the will of our Father: and we are of more value than many sparrows. This will
Mat. 10. 29.
help us, in our patience to possess our souls, because God has done it; and
so acknowledge it is His hand, and that the Lord has done it. Psalm. 109. 27.


Let us examine and search wherefore the Lord has done so unto us. For God
has holy ends and purposes in all His dispensations toward us. Has God taken
away a near Relation from me, as a loving Husband, tender Wife, or a hopeful
Child (to instance in these) which was the desire of mine eyes, and the joy of
my heart; if God has taken Ezekiel. 34. 16.
them away with His stroke; did not I dote or depend too much upon them? did
not my heart run out too much after them? did I use them so as I should when I
did enjoy them? ask thy self these and the like questions; Commune Psalm. 4. 4.
with thine own heart, and be still: go to God in Prayer, and say, wherefore
has the Lord done thus unto me, what means the heat of this great anger?
Deuteronomy. 29. 24.
But be sure to fall out with thy sins and not with God: So search and try thy
ways, and turn unto the Lord Lam. 3. 40.
with thy whole heart; for He does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the
children ver. 33.
of men. Are they dead? death has passed, and will pass upon all men, for Romans
5. 12.
that all have sinned. It is appointed to Heb. 9. 27.
all men once to dye. We must needs dye; and are all as water spilt upon the
ground, 2 Samuel 14. 14.
which cannot be gathered up again: We are strangers and sojourners here, as
all our fathers were; our days on the earth are but as a shadow, and here is no
abiding. If we did not dye, we should 1 Chronicles. 29. 15.
always be subject to sin and misery; death freeth the Saints from all; for
Blessed are the dead which dye in the Lord; yea, (so says the Spirit) for they
Rev. 14. 13.
rest from their labors; and their works follow them.

But see if it be not for any particular sin of thine (this affliction is
befallen thee;) if upon serious search thou find it so to be, then be
humbled for it; repent and amend; and walk more closely with God for the
future. That it may not be said of thee, as formerly of Ephraim, gray hairs are
here and there Hos. 7. 9.
upon him, yet he knows it not: that is, he considered not God's Judgments;
knew not, nor was humbled for his sins, waxed old in his wickedness; yet did
not he know it, or lay it to heart. God does now empty thee from vessel to
vessel, Jer. 48. 11:
and does not suffer thee to be at ease, to be settled upon thy lees: O
therefore let not the taste of thine old corruptions remain in thee, to relish
of them, and like them as formerly; and thy scent not to be changed; when thou
art as worldly and wicked as ever. Zeph. 1^ 12.
For the Lord will surely search thee as with candles, and punish thee and all
those that are settled upon their Lees.

Whatever was good and commendable in thy Deceased Relations, that follow,
practice and imitate; and make good use of.

This affliction of thine is a trial: Ezekiel. 21. 13. Isaiah 48. 10.
God will try thee now in the Furnace of affliction. This may be a sign unto
thee, that thou belongest unto God, who has his ^ire in Zion, and his Furnace
Isaiah 31. 9.
in Jerusalem: Although God may let some run on in outward prosperity, and to
have even more than heart can Psalm. 73. 7. Genesis 15. 16. Mat. 23. 32.
wish; and others to run on in sin, till they have filled up the measure of
their iniquities: God would purify thee, Oh be thou purified and cleansed
hereby! That the trial of thy faith, being 1 Pet. 1. 7,
much more precious then of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire,
might be sound unto praise and honor, and glory, at the appearance of Jesus
Christ.

Thus we see that the afflictions of the Godly are for correction, and for
trial: Blessed are they whom thou chastenest O Psalm. 94. 12.
Lord, and teach them out of thy Law. When Instruction and Correction go
together, that is a happy and a blessed Correction.

Think also on the Saints of God, who through faith and patience inherit the
promises. Heb. 6. 12.


Labor to set Faith on Work, yea, let the trial of thy Faith work in the
patience; and let patience have its perfect Jam. 1. 3, 4.
work, that thou may be perfect and entire, lacking nothing. Thou can not
be a through-out and perfect and an accomplished Christian, unless thou have
obtained this excellent grace of Patience; see that thou abound in this grace
also. 2 Cor. 8. ^.


Q. But why are afflictions called temptations? as blessed is the man that
endures Jam. 1. 12^ Jam. 1. 2.
temptations: And, count it all joy when ye fall into diverse temptations.

I answer: All temptations are not evil; but some are trials of our Faith and
Hope in God (if we can live by Faith and rest upon the promises,) and so they
make much for our good: And in this regard they are pronounced that fall into
diverse temptations.

Therefore ought we not simply to pray, and without exception, to be delivered
from them, but only from the evil of them.

As God led Israel 40 years in the Wilderness to humble them, and to prove
them, to know what was in their Deuteronomy. 8. ^. and 13. 3.
heart, whether they would keep his Commandments or no. And to prove them,
whether they would love the Lord their God with all their hearts, and with all
their souls. So afflictions are called temptations, because by them God tries
our Obedience; to notisie our faith and patience, both to our selves and
others; whether we will follow him or not: And therefore we may be assured,
that so often as we beat back, or overcome the temptations; we have so many
undoubted testimonies of Gods love unto us.

So then, Patience is from the acknowledging of Gods Wisdom, Providence,
Justice and Goodness; to be Obedient unto him, in bearing all adversities and
crosses or losses, which the Lord has brought upon us; and through grief not
to murmur or repine at any of his dispensations; nor to do any thing against
his Comm^^^ements: but in the midst of our grief to retain assured hope and
confidence of Gods help, and to crave aid and deliverance from him: and in this
confidence and acknowledging of Gods Will, to moderate our grief. Psalm 37. 7,
8, 34.
Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: Fret not thy self in any wise to
do evil. So we see that patience is a duty belonging to the First Commandment;
not only because it is a part of that inward obedience which we owe to God, and
he immediately requires it to himself at our hands: but also because that from
our acknowledging of God, our confidence in him, and our love and fear of him
do follow as necessary effects.

To this Christian patience, impatience is contrary and opposed; which
impatience is, when through ignorance or distrust of Gods Wisdom, Providence,
Justice and Goodness; not to be obedient to God in bearing of adversities which
he has inflicted upon us; but through grief to fret against him, or do
something against his commands; not craving deliverance or help from him, nor
moderating grief by the acknowledging and resting on his Divine Will; but to
yield to grief so far, as to be broken and overcome thereby, and so driven to
despair: So did Saul, and Judas Iscariot.

To this impatience belongs that complaining and crying out, as if God
afflicted us beyond our deserts, and we had merited no such thing.

There is also a Hypocritical Patience, as in those who vainly excruciate and
torment themselves; as those worshippers of Baal, who cut and 1 Kings 18. 28
gashed themselves with knives till the blood gushed out. And of the same sort
are also the Popish whippings, etc.

There is also a Stoical Apathy, or insensibility, (which we may call
stupidity) her rejected; because a sense of our grief, and some complaint or
lamentation is not contrary to Patience, so that we charge not God foolishly;
but justify God in his dispensations, and utter nothing against him, and
complain not so much for the affliction as for our sins; and acknowledge that
he has punished us less than our Ezra 9. 15.
iniquities have deserved. Why cryest Jer. 30. 15.
thou for thine afflictions? thy sorrow is incurable, for the multitude of
thine iniquities; because thy sins were increased, God has done thus unto thee.

Thus we may glory in tribulation, knowing tribulation works patience, Romans
5. 3, 4, 5.
and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope makes not ashamed;
because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost which
is given unto us: That is, we rejoice in our present afflictions, which are an
assured proof unto us of everlasting 2 Cor. 4. 17.
glory: These light and momentany afflictions work out for us a far more
exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Here is a Hyperbole beyond an Hyperbole:
It is an evident token unto us of Salvation, Phil. 1. 28.
and that of God. The Holy Ghost does through tribulation fashion and frame us
to Patience; in which God does from time to time, give us assured proofs of His
Grace and Protection, whereby we conceive a firm hope in Him; grounded upon the
love which He bears unto us, which He has given us large cause of feeling, and
has lively sealed it to our hearts, by His Spirit of Adoption.

The more Gods servants suffer tribulation and adversity with patience.

The more they feel in themselves, and have experience of His aid and
assistance; and this makes them more to hope in God, as knowing they shall
never be ashamed of their faith and hope Romans 10. 11,
and considence in Him.

Through patience and comfort of the Romans 15. 4. Luke 8. 15.
Scriptures we have hope. Let us bring forth fruit with patience; such fruits
as God by His dispensations calls for, and requires of us, and that with
patience, (that is) persevering to the last: in the midst of, and
notwithstanding all our trials and afflictions, God will render Romans 2. 7.
to them eternal life; who by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for
glory, and honor, and immortality.

So we have need of patience, that after Heb. 10. 36.
we have done the will of God, we may receive the promise. In all things
approving our selves to be the servants of God, (who is styled the God of
patience) in much patience, in afflictions, Romans 15. 4.
in distresses, in necessities, etc. which 2 Cor. ^. 4.
we endure: Being strengthened with all might (accerding to His glorious power,)
unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness. So that the Ministers of
Col. 1. 11.
Christ may glory in us in the Churches of God, for our patience and faith in
all 2 The^. 1. 4.
our persecutions and tribulations which we endure.

Let us follow after righteousness, godliness, 1 Timothy 6. 11.
faith, love, patience, meekness. 2 Cor. 8. 7.
And as to grow in grace, so also in this of patience: Adding to our faith
virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to 2 Pet. 1. 5. 6, 7.
knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness,
and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity. That
God may know and approve our works, and our labor, and our patience, that we
have born; and have had patience, and have not fainted. Rev. 2. 2, 3.
That it may be said of us among others, Here is the patience of the Saints;
here Rev. 14. 12.
are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. That Christ
may say to us: Because ye have kept the Rev. 3. 10.
word of my patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation, which
shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.

It is not another patience that will avail us, (unless for our example and
imitation,) but in our patience we must possess, and that our own souls.

Consider the work of God: In the Eccl. 7. 14.
day of prosperity rejoice: In the day of adversity consider. God has set the
one over against the other; to the end that man should find nothing after him:
That is, be wise in discerning the various ways of Gods Providence, for to
second them with thine affections, either of joy or sorrow. Since Gods Will
cannot be altered, wisdom should make a man quietly submit unto it; for there
are variable things in this world, to which we must conform our affections both
of joy and grief: Here we may expect nothing but changes and alterations; for
in the midst of life we are in death: Here is no perpetuity of any condition,

Adversity is a considering time, when God writes bitter things against Job.
13. 2^.
us; therefore in the day of adve^^^ty consider: Endeavor to have such a
feeling, as God calls the unto, by His visitation or dispensation; for He
has set adversity against prosperity: He has mixed evil with good, to direct
man by these different means of mildness and severity unto a happy death; for
after death there are no more vicissitudes nor varieties; all things and
conditions are then perpetual, neither is there any place for repentance or
amendment.

Q. What is the true nature of this virtue of Patience?

A. I answer, This Christian Patience looks on a Three fold Object.

1. On God, By whose Good Will and pleasure, all adversities are appointed; and
from thence come. This Job in his afflictions did see and acknowledge, when he
said; shall we Job. 2. 10.
receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In this regard
murmuring against God is opposed 1 Cor. 10. 10.
to patience: Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and were destroyed
of the destroyer. This murmuring against God, is the ready way to our own
destruction.

2. As Patience looks on men for its Object, or those means in the hand of such
instruments, whereby evil is brought upon us: There we ought wholly to leave it
to God, 2 These. 1. 6.
For it is a righteous thing with God, to recompense tribulation to them that
trouble us: If when we do well, and 1 Pet. 2. 20.
suffer for it, we take it patiently, that is acceptable with God. Following
the ^^^. 23.
example of our Savior; who when He was reviled, He reviled not again; when He
suffered He threatened not, but committed His cause to Him that judges
righteously. And in this respect a desire of revenge is opposed to patience:
Avenge not your selves: for it is written, Romans 12, 19.
vengeance is Mine; I will recompense, says the Lord.

3. As Patience has reference to our selves; that through the sense of our
crosses and afflictions, we be not tempted to forsake our duty, which is
incumbent upon us: we have need of patience; that after we have done the will
of God, we might receive the promise. To this is opposed, when our hearts are
broken with afflictions; and from peevishness there hence, to turn out Heb. 12.
13.
of the right way. The just shall live by Heb. 10. 38.
Faith: but if any draw back, God soul shall have no pleasure in them. Make
straight steps for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way,
etc.

Q. By what means may we be confirmed and strengthened in this our Patience: By
these Four Arguments.

A. 1. Because without this Patient enduring (for so the Greek word
sig-Nifies,) no good thing can be perfected in us. Let patience in you have its
perfect Jam. 1. 4.
work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.

2. Because without patience we cannot possess our own souls; in your patience
possess ye your souls: If thou faint Prove. 24. 10.
in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.

3. Because by these troubles we are called forth by God who tries us, to
combat against the Devil, who then (when we have any notable cross or
affliction upon us) will be sure to tempt Heb. 10. 32.
us. Call then to remembrance the former days, in which after ye were
illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions. Now if we are foiled by
Satan, it will be a great dishonor to God, and a great calamity to our selves:
Therefore, Romans 12. 21,
be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

4. Because in this combat, as God will give unto us strength, so He will
grant us a happy issue: There has no Cor. 10. 13.
temptation taken you, but such as is common unto man: but the Lord is
faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but
will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear
it.

To sum up all, as we said before; Patience is a Christian virtue, whereby we
willingly submit our selves to the pleasure of God in all things; and with
alacrity and cheerfulness go through those troubles which He sends upon us;
like obedient children meekly enduring the correction of our heavenly Father.

The vices contrary to Patience are,

1. In defect, murmuring and impatiency, in grudging to bear whatsoever cross
the Lord shall lay upon us.

2. In excess, stupidity, in not being touched with, nor profiting under, or
by, the Hand of God, when it is upon us.

This Patience is a virtue, which does arise from our assiance and trust in
God; which is a duty enjoined in the First Commandment.

EXERCITATION THE TWELFTH.
James 4. 6. God resists the proud; but gives grace to the humble.
HEre be two entire Propositions: the subject, Copula, and Praedicate, in each
of them. The first is this,

1. God resists the proud:

And then with the Supplement ( God) which is necessarily understood.

2. The second is, God gives grace to the humble.

The word ( But) shows the great contrariety in the account and esteem of God
between the proud and the humble: they are as contrariant as Hell to Heaven.

First to speak of the first Proposition, and open the words, and descant a
little upon them.

1. God resists the Proud. The great, the mighty, the All-mighty, the just,
the terrible and sin-revenging God, who with the breath of His lips shall slay
the Isai. 11. 4.
wicked; it is He that resists proud men. He resists them: the word in the
Original is (...), which signifies that God opposes them, and sets himself
against them. God opposes and sets Himself against all proud persons, for that
they oppose and set themselves against Him.

Now we must know that in Scripture Phrase, the proud and wicked, and they that
are hated and abhorred of Psalm. 31. 23. Mal. 3. 15.
God, are synonimous, do signify and are taken for one and the same. Behold
and 4. 1.
the day of the Lord comes* that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud,
yea, and all the wicked shall be stubble, and the day that comes shall burn
them up, and it shall leave them neither root nor branch. It is endless to
quote all the Texts of Scripture to this purpose, that proud and wicked in
Scripture are convertible terms; they are and signify one and the same.

The word ( Proud) in the Original is, (...), which is from (...) appar^^, in
lucem profero, etc. and (...) supra, to appear and show themselves above
others. Endeavor in a plain and practical way to speak to the meanest
capacity. We will first set down what Pride is?

Pride is, an inordinate affectation of Definition of Pride.
our own parts or excellency. I will not speak of pride of Apparel, which is
childish, and very wicked; for apparel is the badge both of our sin and of our
shame: Before the Fall, we read, that the man and woman were both naked, Genesis
2. 25*
and were not ashamed.

There is pride, 1. In reference to Parts of Pride.
God. 2. In reference to men. The parts of pride in reference to men are these
five, 1. Boasting. 2. Arrogance. 3. Vainglory. 4. Ambition. And 5. Presumption.

1. If our pride be about those good things which we have, then it is called
Boasting.

2. If it be about those things which we would seem to have, it is called
Arrogance.

3. If it be concerning our fame and esteem which we seek to have from others,
then it is called Vainglory.

4. If it be concerning dignities and honors, it is called Ambition.

5. If it be concerning getting of things which do exceed our own strength and
power, then it is Presumption.

This affectation of our own parts How it is showed.
worth or excellency, is showed 2 ways.

1. When a man lifts up himself above another.

2. When he arrogateth to himself something above himself. In the former of
these a man is proud either directly or indirectly.

1. Directly, when he simply prefers himself above another.

2. Indirectly and interpretatively, when he will not submit himself to
another, to whom he ought to be subject. In this last respect, as it is pride
against man, not to be subject to Superiors and Magistrates whom he ought to
submit unto, which he is enjoined to do, and Romans 13. 5.
that for Conscience sake. So also it brancheth it self out in the second place
in reference to God.

2dly. Pride against God is showed when men will not be subject to God's Will,
and refuse to hear and obey His Word. Then spoke all the proud men Jer. 43. 2.
saying to Jeremiah, Thou speak falsely, the Lord has not said so. To these
the same Prophet in another place speaks, Hear ye, and give ear, be not
proud; for 13. 15.
the Lord has spoken.

There is another sort of pride also simply against God, when a man is proud of
his Gifts and Graces, or of the performance of duties, or any enlargedness
therein; which of all pride is most devilish. O watch thy heart hereagainst;
(for Satan will be apt to tempt thee; lest thou fall into the condemnation 1 Timothy 3. 6.
of the devil: be humbled for it, and Pray against it. For what have thou that
thou have not received? will thou then boast, or be puffed up with pride, as if
thou had not received it? 1 Cor. 4. 7.


But to speak a little more of pride toward men, which we should have done
before; and then to proceed in speaking more fully of pride immediately toward
God.

Pride in reference to men, is toward Superiors, or Inferiors, or Equals.

1. Toward Superiors, when proud men will not be subject to them.

2. Toward Inferiors, when they will not behave themselves so toward them, as
is meet; but scorn them and trample upon them.

3. Toward Equals, when they desire to be, or seem to be higher than they.

This pride is either in heart, or in speeches, or in outward gesture.

1. In the heart; then it is called a lifting up of the heart, so it is spoken
of Amaziah; when he had smitten the Edomites, ^ Chr. 25. 19.
then his heart was lifted up. So Ezech. 28. 2.
of the King of Tyrus, because thine heart is lifted up, etc.

2. In speeches, then it is called boasting; when a man's own tongue Prove. 20:
6.
proclaims his own goodness.

3. In outward gestures; The daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with
stretched forth necks, and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, etc.
Isai. 3. 16.


To speak a little more of pride against God: Oh this pride! Some learned men
do hold, that it was this sin of Pride, that did cast the Angels out of Heaven:
mistaking that place, Isai. 14. 13, 14. which is meant of the King of Babylon.
The sin of the Angels comprehended pride, envy, and more too; Being an utter
falling away from God, and that holy standing which God had placed them in;
especially to minister to man's good. So also pride was a great ingredient in
the sin of our first Parents; though in general it was disobedience: the
degrees whereof were, first infidelity; then pride; and lastly, the disavowing
of subjection to God; Genesis 2. 16, 17. and 3. 6, 7.
by eating the forbidden fruit: which they imagined should be the means to
attain to a higher degree of blessedness; but proved to be the sin that
procured their fall. Thus we see the rise and original of pride; and how odious
it is to God; and the dreadful consequences of it. It made the Angels become
Devils: and God spared them not, but 2 Pet. 2. 4.
threw them out of heaven, and cast them down to hell, and delivered them into
Jude 6.
chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment. So also it cast our first
Parents out of Paradise; brought upon them, and all their posterity, sin,
guiltiness, and punishment, (which three do always follow one upon another) all
manner of miseries, death, yea, everlasting death and damnation, without
Christ's merits and God's mercies. This is the fruit of pride: and yet we are
still so wicked, and such fools to hug this serpent, this viper of pride in our
bosoms. This was the iniquity of Sodom, Pride, fullness of bread, and abundance
of idleness was in her, etc. and they were haughty, etc. Therefore (said the
Lord) I took them away, as I saw good. And Ezekiel. 16. 49, 50.
still this pride reigns in Sodom's children: though God has revealed His
wrath from Heaven against it, by such terrible vociferations. Pride and
arrogance Romans 1. 18. Prove. 8. 13.
do I hate. They that are lifted up with pride, fall into the condemnation 1 Timothy 3. 6.
of the Devil. A man's pride shall bring him low. Pride goes before
destruction, Prove. 29. 23. Prove. 16. 18.
and a haughty spirit before a fall. When pride comes, then comes shame. Only

by pride comes contention. The pride of their heart will deceive them; when
God shall stain the pride of all glory, this shall they have for their pride,
they shall lie Zeph. 2. 10. Dan. 4. 37.
down in sorrow. Those that walk in pride, God is able to abase them, and will
abase them. This made the holy Prophet Jeremiah tell the Jews, My soul Jer: 3.
17.
shall weep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and
run down with tears; yet the wicked through the pride of his countenance will
not seek Psalm. 10. 4.
after God; God is not in all his thoughts. Though their pride testifyeth to
their face, yet do they not return to the Lord, Hosea 7. 10.
nor seek him for all this; but have their hearts lifted up, and their minds
Dan. 5. 20. Psalm. 31. 23. Prove. 15. 25.
hardened in pride. Though the Lord will plentifully reward the proud doer: and
will destroy the house of the proud. Every one that is proud in heart, is
abomination to the Lord; though hand join in hand (though he use all outward
Prove. 16. 5.
means of prevention) yet he shall not be unpunished.

Think upon what God said of Babylon heretofore; She has been proud Jer. 50.
29. 31, 32.
against the Lord: behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, says the Lord
God of hosts; for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee: and the
most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will
kindle a fire in his Cities, and it shall devour all round about him. Wherein
they deal proudly, God will be above them. Do Exodus* 18. 11.
thou think to resist God, when He sets Himself in battel-array against thee?
Who can stand before Him when He is angry? If he does but touch the mountains
Psalm. 104. 32.
and they smoke. Assure thy self, thou can not contend with God: Who Job. 9.
4.
ever hardened himself against God and prospered? Know as thou can not
contend with Him, so He knows thee afar Psalm. 138. 6. Psalm. 73. 27.
off: and all they that be far from Him, shall perish. Talk no more so
exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come forth of thy lips; for the Lord is a
God of judgment, 1 Samuel 2. 3.
and by Him actions are weighed. Though in thy towering thoughts thou think
highly of thy self; yet when God weighs thee in the balance, thou will be
found a pitiful poor empty creature. Therefore hear and give ear, for Jer. 13.
15.
the Lord has spoken these things against thee; and be not proud any longer.

The height of pride is scornfulness. He that is proud and haughty, scornful is

his name, who works in the pride of his wrath: this man despises his
neighbor, Prove. 18. 3.
and therefore is destitute of understanding. Judgments are prepared for

proud fools. And so I leave them. Surely God scorneth the scorners; but He
gives Prove. 3. 34.
grace unto the lowly.

Q. What are the proper means, whereby pride may be subdued?

A. 1. With the consideration of the greatness and power of God; the serious
apprehension thereof, will make us vile Job. 42. 5, 6. Romans 9. 20. 21.
in our own eyes, and to abhor our selves in dust and ashes.

2. So the second means is, the consideration of our own vileness.

3. The consideration of those obligations and ties by which we are bound to
subject our selves wholly to God; as He is our Creator, Up-holder, Provider,
and our Lord.

4. The consideration of God's wrath and indignation against all proud persons:
and His grace and favor toward the humble.

Come we now to the second Proposition.

God gives grace to the humble. 2 Proposition.


There are several acceptations of Grace in Scripture. But to wave them: Grace
in God, is His eternal favor and good will, which is the wellspring of all
the benefits we have. So we have it (1 Timothy 1. 9.) according to His own purpose
and Grace: So ( Romans 11. 6.) if of Grace, then not of works. This is the Grace
of Election, which makes us gracious and acceptable unto God.

There is also Grace freely given; as the gifts of the Spirit freely bestowed
upon us: so we are bid to grow in Grace. So also faith, with all the saving 2
Pet. 3. 18*
effects and fruits thereof; which are called Grace; because they are freely
given unto us. So also the free imputation Romans 5. 1. 15* 17. 20, 21.
of Christ's righteousness (or our justification) is by God's Grace, and called
the Grace of God, which has abounded unto many.

By the name of Grace we use to comprehend the free favor of God in Christ,
and His gifts from that Grace; whether given to believers, as ingraffing into
the body of Christ by His Spirit, remission of sins, final perseverance or to
hold out unto the end, and in the end eternal life. These gifts are not given
of God, but only to those who are in His Grace and favor, that is, to true
believers. But corporal and temporal good things are given to many, yea, to
those that are not true believers, and have no faith whereby men alone may
please God. Heb. 11. 6.


Some do understand by Grace in this place, favor and acceptance with God
Luke 2. 80.
and men: So we read that Jesus grew in Grace and savor with God and men, so
it is in the Original. The Lord will give his people grace and glory, and no
good thing will ^e withhold from them that Psalm. 8^. 11.
walk uprightly. So God gives grace to the humble, makes them accepted and
favored with God and men. Briefly Grace in Scripture is used three ways.

1. For comeliness, stature, meekness, or mildness.

2. For free favor whereby one embraces another, pardoning former injuries,
and receiving the party offending into favor. So Genesis 6. 8. Noah found grace
in the eyes of God.

3. For all kinds of gifts and graces which of God's free favor are given,
whether temporal or eternal, Ephesians. 4. 7. So I understand that grace is taken
here. Now to speak of humility, we have the same expression in St. Peter as is
here. All of you be subject one to another, and 1 Pet. 5. 5, 6.
be clothed with humility; for God resists the proud, but gives grace to the
humble. Humble your selves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may
exalt you in due time.

A humble man signifies one lowlyminded, A description of Humility.
esteeming others better than himself, ascribing all unto God; being little in
his own eyes or account, even as a weaned child* Whosoever shall humble Mat.
18. 4.
himself as this little child (says our Savior) the same is greatest in the
kingdom of God. So David, to profess his humility, said, Surely I have behaved
and quieted my self as a child that is weaned of his mother; my soul is even
Psalm. 131. 1. ^.
as a weaned child. Christ in his incarnation exceedingly humbled Himself for
us, in that He would be man, a Servant, and subject to death; yea, the death of
the Cross; He being equal to God. God Phill. 2. 5, 6, 7, 8.
abaseth Himself to behold the things in heaven, how much more the things on
earth? The great God has two houses where He dwells; as in His glory He Psalm.
113. 6.
dwells in Heaven, so is He present by His grace to dwell with His humble
afflicted poor servants here on earth. To this man will I look, says the Lord,
even to him that is poor, and of a contrite Isai. 66. 2.
spirit, and that trembles at My word. Thus says the high and lofty One, that
inhabiteth eternity, whose Name is holy; I dwell in the high and holy place,
with Isai. 57. 15.
Him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit; to revive the spirit of the
humble, and ^o revive the heart of the contrite ones. A man is never so humble
as after he has received the holy Spirit of promise. The best men are worst
and lowest in their own eyes. As the attaining of great learning makes us see
our own ignorance more and more: (for the emptiest vessels sound most:) so the
more grace we have, the more we see our own weaknesses and corruptions, to be
humbled under the sense of them, and to loath our selves in our own sight for
all Ezekiel. 36. 31.
our iniquities. This puts a man quite out of conceit with himself, for that
the Lord comes in as the Sunshine, and shows him those corruptions which he
never saw before; that he wonders at himself, how he has lived so long with
himself, and knew himself no better: This makes him humble, and is a means to
keep him humble.

Now there is a Twofold Humility, 1. Toward God. 2. Toward Man.

1. Of Humility toward God; and that is a holy submission, which is joined
with the fear of God: Submit your Jam 4. 7. Prove. 22. 4.
selves to God. By humility and the fear of the Lord, are riches and honor and
life: There humility and the fear of the Lord are joined together.

Q. By what Arguments may a man be excited to the study of humility toward God?

A. 1. If he sets before his eyes the Majesty and Power of God.

2. If he thinks on the nature of humility, which makes the soul of man fit
Isa. 66. 3. Prove. 11. 2.
to be the House and Temple of God; and that it may be capable of wisdom; that
it may be a Sacrifice unto God: that it may be the Receptacle of the Psalm. 51.
19, Prove. 3. 3, 5.
Grace of God; for with the lowly is wisdom.

This humility is the mother of all other virtues, and is also a singular
Ornament 1 Pet. 3. 4.
of the soul. The Ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, is in the sight of God
of great price.

3. If he is mindful of the promises made to the humble, the Lord has a
respect unto them: To this man will the Isa* 66. 2.
Lord look that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and that trembles at His
word. The Lord will give grace to the humble, J^m. 4. 10.
and he will lift them up. He that Luke 18. 14.
humbles himself shall be exalted.

4. If he consider, that humility is necessary to seek God, and to turnaway His
anger: And when the Lord ^eph. 2. 3. ^ Cron. 12. 7.
saw that they humbled themselves, He said, because they have humbled
themselves, therefore I will not destroy them, etc.

5. If he understand that humility is required in every duty toward God: What
does the Lord require of thee but Mic. 6. 8.
to love mercy, and do justly, and walk humbly with thy God? As if the Prophet
had said, we can never walk with God, please Him, or be acceptable to Him,
without humility.

2. Of Humility toward Man; Out of conscience toward God, we must behave our
selves humbly toward man; yea, and the sense and acknowledging of our vileness
and unworthiness before God, makes us truly submissive; and so does dispose us
to true humility in every respect.

Humility toward man, is a virtue, Definition.
whereby a man takes heed that he lift not up himself above his degree, nor
willingly commend himself; as knowing that whosoever exalts himself shall Mat.
23. 12. Luke 14. 11. 2 Cor. 10. 12.
be abased; but he that humbles himself shall be exalted. There are Three
marks of humility toward men.

1. A humble man affects not those outward signs of eminency, as the
uppermost Mat. 2^ 6, 7, 8
rooms, chief seats, greetings in the market, the cup and knee, etc. like proud
Haman, who so stormed, and was full of wrath, because Mordecai Ester 3. 2, 5:
bowed not, nor did him obeisance; But in lowliness of mind let each esteem
Phil. 2. 3.
others better than himself. I speak not to countenance saucy pride, neglect,
or contempt; for we should give honor to whom it belongs. Honor is Romans 13. 7.
in the person honoring; not in the person honored. What if a proud and
unmannerly person sleights and neglects me, shall I fret my self at it?

2. A humble man bears the contempt of himself; so far as belongs to 2 Cor.
5. 12, 13.
himself: So David when Shimei cursed him, and slang stones; he meekly replied
let him curse; it may be the Lord will look upon my affliction, and will
requite good for his cursing me this 2 Samuel 16. 7, to 12.
day.

Lastly, A humble man will not aspire Psalm 131. 2, 3. Jer. 14. 5.
to high things. Jeremy blamed Baruch for this; seek thou great things to
thy self? seek them not.

Next, as there is humility toward God, and toward man: So also there is
humility in condition and estate; when a man is low and mean and poor in the
world. There is also a voluntary humility, and the Popish Vow of Col. 2. 18.
Beggary, etc. which have no warrant in the word of God; and who required this
at their hands? It is humility in heart and spirit which is here meant.

This humility is the first step to Christianity: Our Savior said, whosoever
Lu^e 9. 23.
will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow
Me. A man that is not humbled is not sit for any good duty. God offers
abundant mercy to us in His Son Christ Jesus, even the treasure of heavenly
grace; an unhumbled and a proud heart is not fit to receive it. Satan has so
filled his heart with pride, he has no room to receive it; he does Luke 16. 11.
not desire it, but to get riches and honor, credit and esteem in the world;
and to be revenged on those whom he apprehends have slighted him: this he
desires and seeks after. He cares not for the true riches and true honor,
which is from God alone. Tell such a one of the plentiful Redemption wrought
out by Christ's death; what does he esteem it? he has no such feeling, that he
is in an undone and lost condition without it.

As in the Apostles days, some were such proud worldly-wise fools, who could
not see the excellency of heavenly knowledge, but esteemed the Preaching of the
Gospel foolishness: So St. Paul when he was at Athens (the 1 Cor. 1. 21.
Famousest University in the world,) was very much slighted of those great
Philosophers and Scholars; some mocked Acts 1^. 18, 32.
and others said, what will this babbler say? Even so it is in our days. Others
are so wise in their own conceit, thinking they know enough already; they are
too good to be iustructed, and too wise to be taught. No no, God has promised,
the meek He will guide in Psalm. 25. 9.
judgment, and the meek He will teach His way. He silleth the hungry with good
Luke 1. 53.
things; Therefore, blessed are they that hunger and thirst after
righteousness, Mat. 5. 6.
for they shall be filled. God will satiate the weary soul, and replenish every
Jer. 31. 25.
sorrowful soul; that is, every contrite and humble soul, which is sorrowful
and broken for sin; and hungreth and thirstest after Christ and His
righteousness and the grace of His Spirit, God will satiate and replenish them.

The Word is compared to Seed: Mat. 4. 14.
Now the seed can take no good root in the ground, until it be broken and
turned up with the Plough. So neither can the Word take any place in the heart,
before it be rent and broken for sin and from sin; therefore the Prophet Joel
bids them to rend their hearts. Jo^l. 2. 13. Jer. 4. 3.
And Jeremy bids them, break up the sallow ground of your heart; and sow not
among thorns. If that men will not thus rent their hearts, God will rent the
caul ^o^* ^^* 3.
of their hearts, consume and destroy them.

Humility, is to acknowledge that all the good things which are in us, or done
by us, are not from any worth or excellency in our selves: but meekly from the
free grace and goodness of God. And so from the acknowledgment of His Divine
Majesty, and our own frailty and unworthiness to submit our selves wholly to
God; to give glory of all those good things in us to Him alone; and so truly
to fear God: to acknowledge and deplore all our sins, wants and weaknesses; not
to desire great things or high places, but to contain our selves within our own
place and callings; not resting on our own endowments, but wholly on Gods help:
not to despise others in comparison of our selves, nor hindering them in the
performance of their duties; but to acknowledge that others are and may be as
worthy instruments of Gods glory as our selves, and so to give them honor and
respect accordingly: Not to affect excellency above others, but to be content
with our place, and those gifts which God has given us; and to employ all our
gifts and studies and parts to Gods glory, and the good of our Neighbors; not
to murmur against God, if we are frustrated of our hope; if we are contemned
and despised of some, but in all things to give unto God the praise of His
Wisdom and Justice. This is the practice of an humble man. Job 22: 29.


When men are cast down, then thou shall say, there is a lifting up; and God
will save the humble person. He forgets Psalm. 9. 12.
not the cry of the humble. He will Psalm. 10. 17.
hear the desire of the humble. A man's pride shall bring him low; but honor
shall uphold the humble in spirit. It is Prove. 29. 23. Prove. 16. 19.
better to be of an humble spirit with the lowly; than to divide the spoil with
the proud.

God said by Moses to Pharaoh, How Exodus 10. 3.
long will thou refuse to humble thy self before Me? When he had so many
Plagues and Judgments upon him, yet he did not humble himself; but his heart
and the hearts of his servants were not humbled; therefore they were utterly
destroyed and consumed, and sunk like a stone in those mighty waters of the
Red Sea: So God brought them low.

Now these things are written for our 1 Cor. 10. 11. and 7. 8.
admonition, that we should not be proud and stubborn, haughty and rebellious,
etc. as they were; lest God pour down His vengeance and judgments on us
likewise.

The humble shall see ( and be glad) Psalm. 34. 2.
and consider it; their heart shall live that seek God.

O consider this, ye that proudly forget God, lest He tear you in pieces, and
Psalm. 50. 22.
there be none to deliver; yet there is hope for all this, if thou will humble
thy self and pray, and seek the face of God, and turn from thy wicked ways;
then 2 Chronicles. 7. 14. Isai. 55. 7.
will the Lord hear from heaven, and will pardon thy sins, and will have mercy
upon thee: For God resists the proud; but gives grace to the humble.

Humility makes men like to the holy Addition.
Angels; but Pride made those become Devils that were Angels. Pride was born in
Heaven, and as if it had forgotten which way it fell there-hence, it can never
return thither again.

Pride is the very beginning, and end and cause of all Sin: it is the root of
all evil, and Mistress and Queen of all other vices. Other vices do only oppose
and fight against those virtues which they are contrary unto; as Drunkenness
warreth against Sobriety, Anger against Patience, Wantonness and Whoredom
against Chastity, etc. but Pride lif^eth up it self against all virtues, and
like a general and pestiferous Disease corrupts them all.

One said well, there are four things draw the Chariot of Pride, 1. Desire of
Dominion. 2. Love of ones own praise. 3. Contempt of others. 4. Disobedience.
And the wheels of this Chariot are, boasting and arrogance, multitude of words
and levity. The Chariot-driver is the spirit of Pride; and all they that are
lovers of this present world, are carried in this Chariot: the horses of this
Chariot are unbridled; the wheels are very slippery; the Chariot-driver very
perverse and furious; and they that are carried therein, very infirm and weak
persons. Therefore this sin of Pride is to be cut down and grubbed up even at
the very roots, lest hiddenly and secretly it rising up, it grow and increase
by our allowing and bearing with it, and so become stronger by use and custom,
much care and watchfulness is required against it.

Pride overthrew the Tower of Babel; confounded our Speech; prostrated Goliath;
hanged Haman; slew Nicanor; killed Antiochus; drowned Pharaoh; destroyed
Sennacherib; made Nebuchadnezar like a beast; Herod to be eaten up with worms;
ruined stately Cities and Palaces; and God sets Himself against all proud
persons.

The Heathens could say, Nosce teipsum, e caelo descendit. Know thy self, is a
saying or an Oracle from Heaven. They that know themselves cannot be proud
persons: for they see so much sinfulness, weakness, ignorance, and infirmities
in themselves, which kills Self-love (that (...)) and makes them even out of
conceit with themselves; seeing they have nothing but sin in and from
themselves. Every man of himself is a very Devil; having nothing but wickedness
in him. All the imaginations and thoughts of his heart are only evil,
continually evil, and extremely evil. If Genesis 6. 6^
he has any good at all in him, it is from God.

He cannot think a good thought as of himself, (much less speak or do that
which is good) all our sufficiency is 2 Cor. 3. ^.
of God.

Man by the fall of Adam, was despoyled of all spiritual and supernatural
gifts, as faith, love, righteousness, etc. so also of all natural gifts, as
understanding, judgment, will, etc. which although they are not taken away, yet
the uprightness, soundness and regularity of them is lost. The understanding
being filled with darkness and blindness; the will with crookedness and
perverseness, etc. yea, and all things which belong to the blessed life of the
soul are extinguished and lost, until by grace of regeneration they are
recovered. Because Christ restores all these things to us, therefore they are
accounted from another, and not from nature, and therefore were once taken
away. Reason was not taken away by the fall, but it was exceedingly corrupted
and depraved, that only foul ruins thereof do now appear. The light shined in
darkness, Joh. 1. 5.
and the darkness comprehended it not: In the perverted and degenerate nature
of man, there shine yet some sparks, which show him to be a reasonable
creature, differing from brutes, because he is endued with understanding, and
yet that light is choked with great and thick mists of ignorance, that it
cannot effectually get abroad. I might farther expatiate on this, but it is not
to our present purpose. All this is to show that man has no cause to be proud.
If we have any spiritual gifts or graces in us, it is wholly from God: If thou
have received them, why boastest thou as if thou had not received them?
Therefore Humility is a precious virtue and an excellent grace, because in
acknowledging of man's vileness, Gods Highness is exalted. We can never be
righteous till we be humble, nor humble so long as we build on our own
righteousness. There is no way open for us to Salvation, before we have laid
away our pride; for God will bring down high looks, but He will Psalm. 19. 28.
and 25. 9. Isa. 57. 15.
save the humble: God will instruct and teach them; manifest Himself to them,
and dwell with them. Christ thought it not sufficient to teach humility in
words, but sets it out in a Parable, as in a painted table the image and
portraicture of true humility; when He brings in the Publican, standing afar
off, not daring to Luke 18. 3.
lift up his eyes to heaven, but smiting on his breast, and praying on this
wise, God be merciful to me a sinner. We may not think these were tokens of
feigned modesty, that he dared not look up to heaven, or come nearer, that with
smiting his breast he confesses himself a sinner; but they be testimonies of
true humility and inward affection Christ was also sent into the world with
this commission Isa. 61. 1.
to bring glad tidings to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to preach
liberty to the captives, and deliverance to them that are shut up in prison,
and to comfort them that mourn, to give them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy
for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.

Now all proud persons are diametrically contrary to all these Epithetes or
expressions: God will never teach them, or manifest Himself to them, dwell with
them, or save them.

They are far from the disposition of Mat. 11. 28.
the Publican: Christ never came into the world for them; He had no commission
and 9. 12, 13.
from His Father on their behalf: According to His commission, He calls none
but them that are weary and heavy-laden (with the weight and burden of their
sins) to be partakers of His bounty and liberality. He came not to call the
righteous; (those that are puffed up, highly conceited, and proud of themselves
and their own righteousness*) but sinners to repentance: (that is, those that
see their sins, bewail them, and are humbled under them, laboring under the
weight of them; and seeing their own inability and insufficiency in the
business of Salvation, bring their poor sin-sick souls to Christ the great and
good Physician to cure them,) for the whole have no need of a Physician, but
they that are sick.

Some few Aphorisms about Humility.

1. Nothing makes us more acceptable to God and men, than lowliness and
humility. 2. We are most precious in Gods account, when we are most low and
vile in our own eyes. 3. He that willingly does not walk humbly here, shall
never be exalted to glory in heaven. 4. This excellent grace of humility makes
the mind free from pinching cares here, and secure from threatened punishments
hereafter. 5. Humiliation or humbling is the way to humility; even as patience
is the way to peace, and much reading is the way to knowledge. 6. If thou
therefore desire this virtue of humility, do not shun or flee from the way of
humiliation. 7. He that is truly humble, lest others should think of him more
or better than he is, will be seemingly ignorant of that which is in himself.
8. When thou see and find thy self truly humbled, thou have a sure sign
and good argument of grace approaching, for God will give grace to the humble.
9. Lay the foundation of humility low here, which is the way to the height of
glory hereafter. Job 22. 19. 10. Will thou attain the height and excellency of
the highest heavens? learn of thy Savior, who was meek and lowly in heart, and
follow His humility. 11. Here behold the honey of humility with the sweetness
of meekness; for even as honey well agrees with Physical confections for all
diversities of Species; so all sorts of ventues are seasoned with the sweetness
of humility. 12. The highest humility is seen in this, when in all things we
willingly subject and submit our wills to Gods will. 13. By humility the
members of Christ know how to overcome the pride of the Devil. 14. Thou can
never be a good Scholar, or prosicient in the School of Christ without
humility. I conclude all with the word of our Savior, Every one that exa^^th
himself, Luke 18. 14.
shall be abased: and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.
Be clothed with humility. 1 Pet. 5. 5.

EXERCITATION THE THIRTEENTH.
1 Peter 5. 10. Casting all your care upon God; for He cares for you.
THE Holy Apostle would have us to strive to free our selves, from all anxious,
and thoughtful and distrustful cares of this life; So the Greek word (...)
signifies, (...), a dividenda and distrahenda mente, from dividing and
distracting the mind. This our Blessed Savior Mat. ^. 25. to the ^n^.
advises us against. When Christ in the 24th ver. said, that we cannot serve
two masters, God and Mammon; for this care divides the heart between God and
Mammon: Therefore (observe the Inference,) take no thought for your life, what
ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, nor yet for your body, what ye shall put
on, etc. The word rendered here ( Thought) is the same in the Greek ((...))
which elsewhere is rendered care: To note out unto us, that Christ would not
have us to use any thoughtful, distracting or heartdividing cares about the
things of this life. And many Arguments and Motives our Savior uses to
dissuade us from it. As

1. From the fowls of the air; which sow not, nor reap, nor gather into barnes;
and yet our heavenly Father feeds them: and are not we much better than they?

2. Which of us by taking such thought or care, can add one cubit to his
stature? So it is very bootless and unprofitable.

3. Consider the Lillies of the field; they toil not, neither do they spin; and
yet Solomon in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these. An argument
from the lesser to the greater: If God so cloth the grass of the field, which
to day is, and to morrow is cast into the ^ire; shall He not much more cloth
us? There also our Savior tax^th us, that we are of so little faith.

4. From the Heathen and Gentiles, (which have no knowledge of the true God, no
interest in His promise;) this is enough for them sollicitously to seek after
these things.

5. Our heavenly Father knows that we have need of these things; and so shall
have while we are here in this life: for God knows as we have souls, so bodies
also, which have need of sustentation, food and raiment, which are needful for
us. And God has promised, not to deny us things which are needful.

6. If we in the first place do seek the kingdom of God, and his righteousness,
all these things shall be added unto us; and given in as an advantage; for they
are but accessive, and must come in in the second place.

7. Our Savior iterateth His charge unto us; therefore take no thought for the
morrow; for the morrow shall take thought for the things of it self: sufficient
unto the day is the evil thereof. Therefore let us not be troubled through the
care and apprehension of future time; which is a distrustful, a vain,
unprofitable, and sinful care. Time present is only ours; for the future, what
shall betide either us or ours, is known only to God, who has times, events,
and seasons in His own hand.

There is a Twofold care of the things of this life.

1. A care of diffidence, distrusting Gods providence, mercy and goodness,
which is here condemned.

2. A care of diligence, to use industry and diligence in our places and
callings, for the supply of our wants, and of those who depend upon us, with a
moderate care, and that in reference to Gods command; and resting on His
providence, promises, blessings and goodness: This care is good and
commendable; so it be moderate, not to hinder us from, or interrupt us in our
holy duties.

We know it is Gods Ordinance, in the sweat of our face to eat our bread; to
Gen 3. 19.
use pains, diligence and industry: And the Apostle commands, that if any will
2 These. 3. 10, 12.
not work, neither should he eat: And exhorts, that with quietness we work,
and eat own bread: Not to live like droans, devouring the honey which the
laborious Be brings in; but to eat our own bread; bread and maintenance of
our own getting and earning; without being burdensome or chargeable to others.

He becomes poor that deals with a Prove. 10. 4.
slack hand; but the hand of the diligent makes rich: And in the same Chapter
the wiseman has it, the blessing of ver. 22.
the Lord it makes rich; and He adds no sorrow with it. So the meaning is,
the blessing of the Lord which accompanies our honest diligent endeavors, that
makes rich; and the Lord will add no sorrow with it: or we shall have His
blessing with comfort in the enjoyment of it. So a little that a righteous
Prove. 16. 8.
man has, is better than the treasures of many wicked.

Our blessed Savior compares the Mat. 13. 22.
cares of this world to thorns; which as the Apostle speaks, pierce or bore a
man through with many sorrows. 1 Timothy 6. 10.


1. These cares, they are wonderful thorns, and cause vexation of spirit; they
beget many sorrows, and those sorrows at last cause death; for worldly 2 Cor.
7. 10.
sorrow causes death.

2. They are choking thorns; they stifle and keep down all the gracious Seed
of the word; yea, the very natural sproutings of nobleness, ingenuity, and
morality in the dispositions of men.

3. They are deceitful thorns; they will deceive us at last.

4. They are vanishing thorns; nothing so apt to catch fire as thorns, and so
easily quenched. They are quenched Psalm. 118. 12.
like a fire of thorns, said the Psalmist.

Irregular cares are both superfluous, and also sinful.

1. Superfluous; for as unto us belongs the industry, but the care belongs unto
God: unto us, the labor and use of lawful means; but unto God, the blessing
and success of all. God must be trusted with the events of all our pains and
industry: our cares can never bring to pass our smallest desires: the care of
events was ever* God's Prerogative, and belongs wholly to His providence.

2. As irregular cares are superfluous, so also sinful too: for they are
worldly, distrusting of Gods providence; they Jam. 4. 3.
are adulterous cares, stealing away the heart from God; they take off the
heart from the word, and make it become unfruitful. In all these, and other
respects, they are sinful; and we ought to arm our selves against them. For as
in avenging our selves, we sinfully take Gods sword of justice out of His hand,
to whom vengeance belongs; and I Romans 12. 19.
will recompense says the Lord. So in carking or caring for our selves, we
entrench on Gods Prerogative Royal, who has bid us to cast all our care upon
Phil. 4. 6.
Him, for He cares for us. Therefore let us be careful for nothing; but in
Phil. 4. 19.
every thing by prayer and supplication with thanks giving, let our requests be
made known unto God: And our God shall supply all our need, according to His
riches in glory, by Christ Jesus. Yet let us use the means; and be diligent in
the works of our calling. Now in the labor and works of our calling, there is
required a double action of faith.

1. To do our labor in good manner, that is, to the glory of God, and the good
of men with whom we live.

2. In our daily labors to restrain and moderate our care.

Men commonly take upon them a double care, as First to do the works and
labors of their callings. Secondly, to procure a blessing and good success to
their labors.

But faith in God, where it reigns, it stirs up the hearts of men, only to the
first care; which is the faithful discharge of their labors and duties in
their place: And it restrains them from the second, for a blessing and good
success; and makes them to leave that wholly to God. For when men have done
their duty which appertains unto them; then Faith makes them without any more
ado, to wait upon God for a blessing; which (as we said before) is Gods part,
as the former (which is the faithful discharge of our duties in our places) is
our part.

Therefore it is said, cast thy burden Psalm. 55. 2^.
upon the Lord, and He shall sustain thee.

Now this faith whereby we depend upon God for the success of our labors, has
an infallible ground; namely, that God best knows* our wants, and He will give
us all things which He in His Wisdom knows to be necessary for us. So Christ
says, your heavenly Father Mat. 6. 32.
knows that we have need of these things. There is no want to those that fear
Him: Psalm. 34. 9, 10.
The young Lions do lack and suffer hunger, but they that seek the Lord, shall
not want any good thing. If men by faith would build on these promises, they
need not like drudges of the world; toil and spend themselves, and the best
part of their days in worldly cares, so as they do: For they should have a
greater blessing from God, with less care, if they would trust Him: and also
they should have far more time than they have, to care for heaven and heavenly
things.

It is not said this or that place is the 1 Cor. 10* 28.
Lords, but the earth is the Lords, and the fullness thereof. Therefore seeing
we believe God to be our Father, and our heavenly Father, (so He is able and
willing to hear and help us;) this should moderate our care for the things of
this life: For if we know our selves to be the children of God, then we must
also know that God will provide for us: As we know in a family, the father of
the family provideth for all those of his household: God is the great
housekeeper of all the earth. He provideth Psalm. 145. 16.
for the Raven his food; when his young ones cry to God, and wander for lack of
meat. He gives to the beast his food; Job. 38. 41. Psalm. 147. 9.
and to the young Ravens which cry. Does God take care of Beast and Ravens? 1
Cor. 9. 9.
and will He not much more take care for His Children, those of His own
Household? If we should see a young man provide for himself, and no one else for
him; surely we would say his Father is dead: even so, when a man's care both day
and night, is set wholly for the things of this life: it argues either that God
has cast him off, or else that he takes God for no Father of his.

Again, if the Lord does thus take care of His Children, and provideth for them
all kind of benefits: What a horrid wickedness is it, for men to get their
living by ungodly means, as lying, cheating, fraud, carding, dicing, and such
like exercises? If a man were persuaded that God were his Father, and would
provide sufficiently both for his soul and body; so that using lawful means, he
should ever have enough; out of all doubt, he would never after the fashion of
the world, use unlawful and profane means to get a living. But this plainly
evidenceth, that however such men say, that God is their Father, yet indeed
they deny Him.

Our blessed Savior in the Fourth Petition of the Lords Prayer, teaches us to
pray to our heavenly Father, to give us this day our daily bread. Where bread,
(by a Synecdoche very usual to the Hebrews) signifies all corporal good things
necessary for this life; as food, clothing, health, peace, and such like: and
also a good use of them.

Therefore all these good things, Christ comprehends under the name of Bread,
and that for these reasons.

To bridle our lusts; that only bread is to be prayed for; only things
necessary for the sustentation of this life, whereby we may be the better
enabled to serve God and our Neighbor, in our Vocation and Calling; whether in
our general calling as we are Christians, or in our particular calling, in that
place and calling God has set us in.

2. To teach us also, to beg of God, the wholesome and good use of these outward
things.

So then, in the Fourth Petition, when we beg Bread of God: it signifies,

1. Not great riches, but only things necessary; such a proportion of
maintenance, credit, liberty, health, wealth, Prove. 30. 8.
food and raiment, etc. as is convenient for us. And that with condition, if
God see it fit for us, and if it be His goodwill and pleasure. Which exception
is a caution proper to this Petition for outward things.

2. We beg hereby, that these things may be bread to us; that is, that by the
blessing of God, they may be wholesome and good unto us.

And we beg our bread, not another; that which God sees fir for us; which we
may call our own. God as a Father of a Family, distributeth to every one a
portion; which we beg may be given to us: And our bread, bread gotten by our
own labor and industry, that so we may eat the labor of our Psalm. 128* 2. 1
These. 4. 11. 2 These. 3. 12.
own hands; and eat our own bread. And so that is called our bread which comes
to us, by the blessing of God on our lawful endeavors; so that neither God nor
Man can justly implead us for it.

And that we may use it with a good conscience, and with giving of thanks: Let
him that stole steal no more, but rather Ephesians. 4. 28.
let him work with his own hands, that he may have wherewith to give to him
that is in want. God would have us ^e sure, that when He gives us these good
things, He gives us power to use and enjoy them: and He would not have us to
use His gifts as Thieves, but freely, and with thanksgiving to Him for them.

Q. Why do we pray for Daily Bread.

A. Because God would have us every day, to ask so much as is sufficient for
us, for each day.

2. That God may bridle our unsatiable and unruly desires: Our Father Mat. 6.
32.
knows what we have need of. A little that a righteous man has, is better
than Psalm. 37. 16.
the ^iohes of many wicked. No good (and needful) things, shall be wanting to
them that fear the Lord. In the proper Psalm. 34. 10.
language of the Spirit of God, it is, that bread which is fit for me, and
agreeable to my condition.

Q. Why do we pray, Give us this day?

A. 1. That we may be taken off, from distrust and covetousness.

2. That we may depend on God alone, and beg things necessary from Him, and
expect them wholly from Him.

3. That the exercise of Faith and Prayer may be daily continued in us.

4. We Pray for This day, to teach us to Pray for Bread for a day, not for a
month or a year; so to teach us for to restrain our care, that it reach not
too far: but to rest on God's Providence, and present blessings; and so not to
be covetous.

Hereby we profess the moderation of our care and desire of earthly things;
with our purpose every day, by Labor and Prayer, to seek these blessings at
the hands of God.

Here also our affections are forbidden to pass measure; not to have a carking
and troubling care; seeing the present Mat. 6. 34.
vexation of the day is enough for it self: But to commit our ways to God, and
Psalm. 37. 5. Prove. 16. 3.
to roll all our matters upon Him, who will bring them all to pass.

So here we see, that a moderate appetite and desire of having these earthly
things, and a moderate care of procuring them, is approved and required; Ephesians.
4. 28. 2 Cor. 12. 13, 14.
that we may not be burdensome, but rather helpful unto others.

There are two extremes hereof; (we must know that every virtue is a middle
between two extremes.)

1. The first extreme is carelessness and neglect of our goods and estate. For
as he is commended who gathers in seasonable times; so he is much blamed
Prove. 10. 5. and 6. 6.
who neglects those opportunities: and is censured by the Apostle, to be
worse than an infidel. 1 Timothy 5. 8.


2. The second extreme is, an anxious and solicitous care (of which before we
spoke) which distracteth the mind, that it cannot wholly be intent to God's
Service, as is required.

And this does partly arise from covetousness, and partly from diffidence and
distrust in God's Promises and Providence, as before we said.

So we must regulate our desires of these outward things, in subserviency to
God's Will, His Glory, and our own Salvation, and to desire heavenly things in
the first place, before and above all earthly things. Spiritual things we may
pray for absolutely; and there let us open our mouths wide, be large in our
desires for them, and God will fill us. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
Psalm. 81. 10. Mat. 5. 6.
after righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. God takes it well at our
hands, when we ask heavenly things in the first place, then He will give us
earthly things as an advantage. So God did to Solomon, because he asked not
riches, or honor, or the necks of his enemies; but because he asked Wisdom,
therefore said the Lord, Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will
give thee 2 Chronicles. 1. 10, 11, 12.
also riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none ever had before thee* etc.

Take we heed yet, that we seek not earthly things inordinately, or
overearnestly, Genesis 30. 1.
as Rachel said, Give me children, or else I dye: Nor to seek them by sinful or
unlawful means, to the hazard of our souls, and everlasting Salvation.

A Christian can be set in no estate or condition, wherein the abundant care of
God is not seen over him; and commonly in the greatest straights, He shows
the greatest care of us: As water runs strongest in the narrowest passages; so
when we walk in darkness, and have Isa. 50. 10.
no light; when we seek water, and there is none, and our tongue fails for
thirst; Isa. 41. 17.
then is Gods fittest time to help us; and then is our most needful time to
stay our selves upon Him. God many times takes our extremity for His
opportunity to do us good: In the mount will the Genesis 22. 14.
Lord be seen.

Many will say, they trust in God; aye, but most commonly it is, when their
Coffers and Barns are full; then it is an easy thing for them to say, they
depend upon God: But the trial of a Christians Faith, is, if God does strip him
naked and bare of worldly comforts and enjoyments, deprives him of humane
helps; yet then to rest on the Name of Isa. 50. 10.
the Lord and to stay himself upon his God: then to live by Faith upon the
promises; as the Apostle Habakkuk H^b. 3. 17. 18.
said, although the Fig Tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the
Vines; the labor of the Olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat,
the flocks shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the
stalls: Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, and will joy in the God of my
Salvation: The Lord is my strength, etc. Here is the trial of Faith, and of a
holy dependence upon God; if God bring us into such, or the like streights, and
we never let go our hope and confidence in God; but still trust in Him, like
Job, who said, though He kill me, Job. 13. 19.
yet will I trust in Him: then we glorify God by believing, and greatly engage
Him; so that He will doubtless appear for our help, succor, and relieve us for
Psalm. 44. 26.
His mercy and truths sake.

For He that said, Call upon Me, in Psalm. 50. 15.
the day of trouble; I will hear thee, and give the cause to glorify Me. None
that wait upon God shall be ashamed: Romans 10. 11.
We shall never be ashamed of our faith and hope and confidence in Him. For
that engages God to succor, help, and supply us; because we have trusted in
Psalm. 33. 21.
His holy Name. Blessed are all they, that thus wait, and hope, and trust in
God; as in regard of Spiritual and Everlasting Isa. 30. 18.
blessings especially; so also in regard of these Temporal and outward supplies.

This is a great argument we have to prevail with God in prayer, that in Christ
we call Him Father; as God is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ by Eternal
Generation, so in and through Christ He is our God and Father also by Grace and
Adoption: Therefore said our Savior, I ascend to my Father John 20. 17.
and your Father, to my God and your God. We present our selves before God as
His own Children and Servants; we make mention of no other Lord or Name over
us, but His alone: we are called Isa. 63. 8, 19.
by His Name: and therefore He cannot deny us those things which are good for
us.

These outward things are necessary for us in a Threefold respect.

1. In respect of Nature to the sustaining of Nature, as food and raiment.
Having food and raiment, let us therewith 1 Timothy 6. 8.
be content. It was Jacob's desire and wish, if God will be with me, and Genesis
28. 20, 21.
keep me in the way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put
on; so that I come again to my Fathers house in peace, then shall the Lord be
my God, etc.

2. Necessary in regard of Persons, when we have sufficient for our selves, and
those that belong unto us: He that 1 Timothy 5. 8.
provideth not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he has
denied the Faith, and is worse than an infidel: If I have not wherewithal, I
cannot provide for them.

3. Necessary in respect of State, when we have that which is sufficient to
maintain us, in that rank, place, and calling, wherein God has set us.

These things we may lawfully desire and beg of God.

Contrary to these are,

1. A voluntary affectation of poverty, as in the Popish begging Friars;
commending that for a virtue, and a degree of perfection, which the Spirit of
God has taught us to pray against; give me Prove. 30. 8.
neither poverty, nor riches, etc.

2. The immoderate affectation of riches and honor; and that in a greater
measure than is needful for us: If we have more than is needful or necessary,
we are apt to be proud therewith, to have our hearts lifted up with pride, and
so to fall into the condemnation of the Devil: For riches are a snare, and are
1 Timothy 6: 9. ver. 17.
apt to drown men in destruction and perdition; they are also uncertain, they
soon flee away as an Eagle toward heaven; Prove. 23. 5.
and yet they are to us as a stone or a piece of Lead tied to a Bird, hindering
our soaring upwards in heart and affection toward heaven* they are desiling
also, for we cannot tell a sum of money but it will foul our singers; but
worst, they are apt to de^ile our hearts and consciences. It is a very hard
thing to have riches, but they will steal away our hearts to love them ( which
is the 1 John 2. 15.
root of all evil;) and we are bid not to love the world, nor the things which
are in the world; for if we love the world, the love of the Father is not in us.

Rest upon the Providence of God; He will withold no good thing from Psalm.
84. 11.
thee; that is, no thing which He knows to be good or convenient for thee, or
suitable to thy condition and welfare.

Why should we desire a great estate or great matters here? If we have enough
for our Pilgrimage here upon earth, and sufficient till we come to our Genesis 33.
11.
Father's house in peace, we have enough; yea, we have all, as Jacob said to
his Brother Esau, God has settled a high inheritance above upon us; which is 1
Pet. 1. 4.
incorruptible, undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for us.
Oh Psalm* 31. 19.
how great is His goodness, which He has laid up for those that fear Him,
which He has wrought for them that trust in Him, before the sons of men!

Now a word of the Providence of God, and I have done.

I intend not to speak of His Eternal Providence described.
Providence, the good will and council of God, as Acts 4. 28. Ephesians. 1. 9.

But of His actual Providence, which is nothing else, than the execution of the
Decrees of God.

Or the Actual Providence of God, is, whereby God does not only preserve,
sustain, and uphold His creatures; but according to His immense Wisdom,
Goodness, Power, Justice and Mercy, He governs them all.

Whoever deny this Providence of God, deny God Himself.

This Providence is far different from the Fate of the Stoics: Now I mention
the Stoics, I shall speak but a word of the Opinions of the Heathens
hereabouts. There were 3. Opinions of the Philosophers about the Providence of
God.

1. The Epicureans, they denied any Providence at all, over any of these things
here below in the world.

2. The Stoics have devised in stead of Providence, an absolute necessity of
all things and motions, existing in the very nature of things themselves; to
which not only all other things, but also God Himself is subject: which
necessity they call Fate.

3. The Peripateticks they say, that God beholds and understands all
things; He does moderate and rule all; but that He only orders the heavenly
motions, and by these motions of the heavens, He puts a power of acting into
the inferior or lower parts of Nature, meaning those things here below, etc.
But I shall insist no farther on these; desiring to be understood of the
meanest capacity, and that to edify.

These great learned Heathen Philosophers, became vain in their imaginations,
Romans 1. 22.
and professing themselves to be wise they became fools.

So we see the Stoical Fate binds God to the connection of second causes: But
the Christian Fate (if I may call it so,) does make second causes subordinate
to the most free will of God.

The parts of Providence are Two, 1. Conservation. 2. Gubernation: but I must
not expatiate upon these now.

Let us learn to depend on this Providence of God; for both all our beings, and
all our comforts are from Him.

Submit we therefore as our persons and conditions, so also all our thoughts
and affections unto God, in His particular disposing of our persons and
conditions: As if God deny me this or that comfort, inflict such or such a
cross, take away such a Relation, or such like; lay down all at the feet of
God, quietly depend upon Him, commit all to Him, and submit all to His Holy
Will.

Whoever did depend upon God, but sped well?

Consider ancient and former effects of Providence, and providence which are
fitted to thy present condition: That which I desire is not therefore good unto
me because I desire it; but that which God brings upon me, is therefore good,
because He has done it.

Wait Gods time for such or such a mercy, for times and seasons do belong unto
Gods Providence, as well as issues and events: God will send such a merry or
such a deliverance, in its time; God Isa. 60. 2^.
will hasten it in its time.

There is the time, and the season of the time, (in Greek (...) tempus, (...)
tempus certum and divinitus praestitut^^ vel opportunum;) which is a certain ^^
and determined time by God, the tim^ which He sees sit; the time of God^
Providence is always the best time.

Therefore wait patiently upon the Lord; the vision is yet for an appoint^^
Psalm. 62. 5. H^b. 2. 3.
time, but at the end it shall speak, an^ not lie; though it tarry, wait for
it; because it will surely come, it will no^ tarry. Providence many times
doubl^^ the mercy by delaying it: Let us appl^ our selves to the ways of Gods
Providence, study them more, learn them better: use means, but take heed, let
it be lawful means, for unwarrantable and unlawful means are compassed about
with curses.

Preservation, which is one part o^ act of Providence, is either 1st, for the
safety of our persons or 2dly for the susteining of our persons by food and
raiment.

No better way to secure our persons, and for our sustentation also by food and
raiment, than by faith to commit all unto God; and he is sure to be fed, who is
able to believe: Believe* and ye shall be established. If thou would 2 Chr.
20. 20. Psalm. 23. 1.
get a blessing, get Faith: Observe David's faith, The Lord is my Shepherd,
therefore I shall not want. When he had evidenced to his soul his interest in
God, that God was his; thence he draws this inference, therefore I shall not
want: ver. 2.
In which Psalm, we have David's experience of Gods meries to him; He makes me
to lie down in green pastures; He leads me besides the still waters: He makes
me lie down, that is, quietly, thankfully, cheerfully, to feed on these
pastures, and drink of these waters: God has given me a good estate, and a
heart sit for enjoyment of it; He restores ver. 3.
my soul; when my soul has been languishing under temptations, or oppressed
with griefs that it did even faint, then God came in; revived and cherished my
languishing soul. Thus we might take a view of that whole Psalm, which is of
David's great experiences of Gods providence and goodness, and his professed
faith in God; with a sweet conclusion, Surely, goodness ver. 6.
and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: implicitly (by goodness and
mercy) spiritual mercies may be here thought on; but primarily and explicitly,
the continuation of Gods goodness and mercies in temporals, as to me it clearly
seems, is here meant; and than last of all, David's engaging his soul in
perpetual thankfulness, I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever: where
every word has a weight of matter, but we must not dwell upon that now.

Also we must be diligent in our Callings, for an idle soul shall suffer
hunger. Prove. 19: 15.


As we do see the constancy of Providence, even so we shall find the power of
Providence, by bridleing the power of enemies; confounding their power, (as he
did Senacherib's Host:) prospering under their power, (as the more they are
afflicted the more they prosper;) Romans 8, 37.
and at lost conquering them, nay in all these things we are more than
conquerours, through Him that loved us: I could enlarge upon each of these; but
I study brevity.

1. Oh the tenderness of God's Providence Isa: 63. 9.
over His poor servants! in all our afflictions He is afflicted, etc. He Deuteronomy.
32. 10.
keeps us as the apple of His eye: now the apple of the eye is the tenderest
part in all the body.

2. Consider also as the tenderness, so the sidelity of God's Providence; He is
faithful who has promised. Heb. 10. 23.


3. The Wisdom of God's Providence, and that in the several branches thereof;
1. God discerns what is good for us. 2. God foresees all the evils which may
befall us. 3. God sometimes prevents and disappoints them. 4. Gods ordering them
for our good, if they do befall us. 5. Finding out means and ways for our
safety. 6. In seasonable supplies of strength under them, or deliverance from
them. Trust in the Lord, Psalm. 37: 3.
and do good; so shall thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shall be fed.

If we can find an hand to labor and take pains; and faith to believe and
trust, God will find meat to feed us, and raiment wherewith to cloth us: For
He cares for us.

The good old Prophet Elisha, when he had received so many kindnesses from the
woman of Shunem; he said 2 Kin. 4* 13.
unto her, behold thou have been careful for us, with all this care; what is to
be done unto thee for it?

But God has cared for us with great care, in our mothers womb; fearfully
Psalm. 139. 14, 15, 16.
and wonderfully were we made, and curiously wrought in the lower parts of the
earth; in his book all our members were written: He took us out of our mothers
Psalm. 22. 9.
womb: We have been cast upon God from our birth: He has fed us all our Genesis
48. 15.
life long even to this day: His Providence and mercies have been always upon
us; for we cannot subsist a moment without Him. Yet we take not so much notice
of it as we should, nor say in our hearts, what shall we give unto Thee for all
this thy great care over us? Or what shall we render to the Lord Psalm. 116. 12.
for all His benefits toward us?

Let us give up our selves wholly unto God; and present our bodies a living
Romans 12. 1, 2.
sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is our reasonable service; and not
to be conformed to this world, but to be transformed by the renewing* of our
minds, that we may prove what is that good, that acceptable, and perfect will
of God: and that to follow, and to avoid whatsoever is contrary thereunto.

Learn to depend upon God, to live by Faith; ( he that believes makes not Isa.
28. 16.
haste;) to use diligence in our places; and then Cast we all our care upon
God, for He cares for us.

St. Paul plainly condemns the desire Addition.
of riches; that is, of things more than necessary: affirming that such as
desire to be rich, fall into the snares of the Devil. 1 Timothy 6. 9.
Some have observed Twelve wonders in the Manna of the Israelites. 1. They were
fed with it 40 Years. 2. To the Godly it tasted according to every ones desire.
3. To the ungodly it was loathsome. 4. A Gomar of it sufficed all stomachs. 5.
Whether men gathered more or less, they had full measure, neither more or less,
that is a Gomar full. 6. Two Gomars full before the Sabbath, or other days but
one Gomar full. 7. It fell every day, but on the Sabbath day. 8. It melted in
the Sun, and was hardened in the fire. 9. It was kept many years in the Ark
unputrifi'd. 10. Being preserved till the morrow, it putrifi'd, except on the
Sabbath. 11. He that gathered least, had his Gomar full. 12. He that gathered
most, had but his Gomar.

Now by the most of these wonders we are taught, and especially, in that Manna
laid up till the next day putrifi'd; and that every Israelite had his competent
measure, were his labor more or less: It shows that the seeking of abundance
pleases not God.

An Omer or Gomar was a measure of dry things; also a Sheaf of Corn or handful,
(...); because usually that Ruth. 2. 7.
which was beaten out of a Sheaf, might fill a Gomar.

God knows what is fittest for us: Nature is content with little, Grace with
less.

To speak a little more of the Providence of God.

The Providence of God is His eternal, Another Description of Provia^nce.
most free, immutable, most wise, and most just Council, according to which He
works all good things in His creatures; permits evil things to be done,
and directs all things both good and evil to His own glory, and the good of
His Elect.

I could prove out of Scripture every word of this Definition; but I study
brevity.

All things come to pass by the Providence of God, both things past, present
and future. So God said by the Prophet; Remember the former things Isa. 46. 9,
10.
of old, for I am God, and there is none else: I am God, and there is none like
Me: Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things
that are not yet done; sayiny, my Council shall stand, and I will do all my
pleasure.

Consider the degrees of Providence; God cares for, and Governs all His
creatures, but especially mankind, as the chief among the works of Creation,
and made in the image of God; and in mankind, especially the Elect and chosen
to life Eternal, whom He makes one everlasting Church with the blessed Angels,
that He might dwell in them as in His Temple and Habitation: Therefore does He
so lead them and govern them through the whole course of their life, that all
things may serve and ^end to their everlasting Salvation.

Gods Providence is over us in the whole course of our lives. So He said Genesis
28. 19.
to Jacob, Lo I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou
go, etc. For I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have
spoken to thee of. So Laban would have injured and deceived Jacob, but God
suffered Genesis 31. 7, 8, 9.
him not to hurt him; yea, God blessed Jacob the more, for Labans deceits and
wrongs intended toward him. So God said to Paul, Fear not, for I am with thee,
Acts 18. 9.
and no man shall set upon thee to hurt thee. It is endless to quote all the
texts in the Old and New Testament to this purpose: I will only add a few
Corollaries.

1. God will have glory attributed Corollar^^^.
to Him, not only as He is the Creator and Upholder of Heaven and Earth; but
also the most High, Wise, Just, and Great Governor and Directer of all things.
This is against the Figments of the Bpicureans and Pelagians.

2. This Doctrine of Providence may confirm and strengthen our hearts against
the Blasphemies of the Manichees and Libertines; who say that God wills sin
as it is sin: Whereas He wills the act, but not the evil of the act, etc.*

3. Against the Opinion of the Stoics; for all things are governed by Gods
most free and unchangable Decree.

4. Therefore He will be acknowledged and praised by us, as the Author,
Fountain, and Worker of all good things: for nothing in any creature is or can
be of good unto us, but by Gods Will affectually working in it, and by it.

5. Seeing all good things are from God; Let us not sacrifice to our own ^^^.
1. 16.
nets, or burn incense to our own drag; that is, not resting in creatures, or
second causes, by which we may be benefited; but giving all glory and praise to
God, to acknowledge the creatures are but instruments and ministers in His hand,
and by His ordering, to do good unto us.

6. Since nothing rashly or casually happens to us, but all things betide us
by Gods most Blessed, Just, and profitable Decree and Good Will toward us: Let
us effectually be stirred up, by knowing and acknowledging hereof, to exercise
patience in all our adversities: As Psalm. 39. 9.
David said, I was dumb and opened not my mouth, because Thou have done it:
Job. 1. 21.
And Job, the Lord has taken away; blessed be the Name of the Lord.

7. Let our confidence and comfort be sound, firm, and established in the Lord,
who will defend and preserve us in the midst of all enemies and dangers;
moderating and ordering all evils so, that they tend to our good and salvation:
For we know, that all things work Romans 8. 28.
together for good to them that love God.

8. By all our past and present afflictions, let us be bettered and amended:
Since not by chance, but by God they are inflicted upon us, that we may say,
Psalm. 119. 71.
It is good for me that I have been afflicted, etc.

9. For future crosses and afflictions, (seeing they are signs and tokens of
Gods. anger against sin;) Let us fear them, and strive to avoid them, by
fleeing and abstaining from sin, the cause of them.

10. Let us not faint, much less despair, when we are in dangers, troubles, or
adversities; when the outward means of our deliverance fail, and the creatures
seem to be against us, because God is not tied to help by them; For man lives
not by bread alone, etc. The Mat. 4. 4. and 16. 18.
gates of Hell shall not prevail, etc. There 1 Samuel 14. 6.
is no restraint to the Lord, to save by many, or by few: He can deliver either
by means, or without means, or against means.

11. Seeing all events are ordered by God, and no wholesome counsels can be
undertaken without Him; neither does any thing please Him, but what we
undertake according to His Word: Let us not be lifted up in confidence of our
own wisdom and power, etc. but demeaning our selves in the fear of God, let us
pray that all our actions may be directed by Him, and so blessed unto us; and
that we may never depart from His Will revealed unto us: And then confidently
wait on Him for s^ccess*

12. Since we know (as before we said) God has a care of all things, especially
of mankind, and most principally of His own Children, whom He peculiarly loves
and cares for, so (as Christ said) the hairs of our head Mat. 10. 31.
are all numbered, and we are of more value than many Sparrows: Let us in doing
our duty faithfully in our places, rest confidently on the Providence of God;
Casting all our care on Him, for He cares for us.

EXERCITATION THE FOURTEENTH.
Rev. 20. 12, and 15, Verses. And I saw the dead small and great stand before
God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book
of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the
books, according to their works.

And whosoever was not found written in the book of life, was cast into the
lake of fire.


EXpect not a Logical Analysis of the words, and a procedure thereon
accordingly: that I leave to Divines in their Sermons. But according to my use
in my former Exercitations, to choose out some heads out of the words read, and
so meditate and dilate upon them.

And here we may consider these four heads.

1 Death. 2 Judgment. 3 Hell. 4 Heaven. Accordingly we shall frame our ensuing
discourse.

1. Death; out of these words, And I 1 Death.
saw the dead, etc. First, there must be death, before they could be dead.

2. Judgment; out of these words, 2 Judgment.
Stand before God, etc. and they were judged, etc.

3. This Judgment shall be according to their works. They that have done good,
shall go into life everlasting; and 3 Heaven.
they that have done evil, into everlasting 4 Hell.
fire. So it is in the Creed of Holy Athanasius. And so also in the Apostles
Creed, I believe that Christ shall come to judge both the quick and dead; I
believe the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. So also in the
Nicene Creed: That is, everlasting life, for the good in heaven: and
everlasting life for the wicked in hell, in those never Mark 9. 44.
dying flames, where the worm dies not, and the fire never goes out.

First, to speak of Death. Death is the 1 Death.
fruit of Sin. Sin brings shame, misery and death.

1. Sin brings shame; for before the fall, our first Parents were both naked,
Genesis 2. 25.
and were not ashamed. But since the fall, sin causes shame, in all men and
women, except those who are come to that height of impudence, that they are
past shame: of whom the Prophet speaks, Were they ashamed when they had Jer. 6.
15.
committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they
blush: Therefore said the Apostle, What Romans 6. 21.
fruit had ye then, in those things whereof ye are now ashamed, etc?

2. Sin brings all sorts of miseries, calamities, losses, etc. I have wounded
them Jer. 30. 14, 15.
with the wounds of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the
multitude of thine iniquities; because thy sins were increased, I have done
these things unto thee.

3. Sin brings death; the end of these Romans 6. 21.
things is death. So we see that sin, guiltiness, and punishment, did grow from
the fall of our first Parents.

The punishment of sin, (which we now speak of) is the wrath and curse of God,
by whose just sentence, man is delivered over for his sin, into the power both
of bodily and spiritual ^eath, begun here, and to be accom^lished hereafter.

Bodily death is the separation of the ^ul from the body, with all personal
^iseries and evils that attend thereon, ^^ make way thereunto.

Spiritual death is the final separation ^f both soul and body from God,
together with spiritual bondage, and all ^re-runners of damnation.

Or more particularly, All the misery ^f man, God in this one word [ Death]
^^th comprehended. In the day thou Genesis 2. 17.
^^est of the tree of knowledge of good and ^^il, thou shall dye.

There are four degrees of death.

1. There is a spiritual death, which a privation of spiritual life; whereby
man is destitute of saving Grace, and ^ lives only unto sin. So Christ of the
church of Sardis, I know thy works; Rev. 3. ^.
^ou have a name that thou live, but thou ^t dead.

2. The second degree is, of afflictions ^d miseries. So Pharaoh said to Moses
^d Aaron, Pray ye to the Lord, that He Exodus 10. 17.
^ay remove from me this death only.

3. Corporal death, which is a priva^on of natural life, and a resolution of
the body into dust, and returning o^ the soul again unto God. Then shall the
dust return to the earth as it was; and Eccles. 12. 7.
the spirit unto God that gave it.

4. The fourth degree is everlasting death, or the state of the damned Rev. 21.
8.
which in respect of corporal death, ^^ called the second death. But it is the
third of these, corporal death, which ^^ here meant.

Spiritual death has three degrees.

1. When a man who is alive in regard of corporal or temporal death lies dead
in sins. She that lives in pleasures, is dead while she lives. And this 1 Timothy 5. 6.
is the case of all men by nature, wh^ are children of wrath, and dead in sin^
Ephesians. 2. 1.
and trespasses.

2. The second degree is, the very end of this life; when the body is to be
laid in the earth, and the soul descend^ to the place of torment.

3. The third degree is, in the day o^ Judgment, when the body and soul me^^
again, and go both to the place of the damned, there to be tormented for ever
and ever.

But now we are to speak of tempora^ or corporal death, which is a punishment
inflicted on man for sin. Death passed upon all men, for that all have Romans 5.
12.
^inned. This death is a miserable pri^ation of life. And yet this death is not
so properly, as by Gods appointment; ^ut from God, as revenging on Sin: and so
properly it is from Sin, as the meritorious and procuring cause of it: And so
this death is not only a simple and a bare privation of life, but joined with a
subjection unto misery. Therefore it is not an annihilation of the Sinner;
because the subject of misery being taken away, then misery it self should be
taken away also.

Now since we must all dye, let us labor Heb. 9. 27.
to dye well. To dye well, two things are requisite; 1. A preparation 1.
Preparation before death.
before death. 2. A right behavior and disposition in death:

1. The preparation unto death, is an action of a repentant Sinner, whereby he
makes himself ^it and ready to dye. That which we can do but once, how careful
should we be to do it well; since there is no place after, for amending of
errors therein committed? This preparation is a duty very necessary, to which
we are bound by God's Commandment. Therefore we are bid to watch and pray. As
death leaves us, so judgment finds us; as the tree falls, so Eccles. 11. 3.
it lies.

This preparation is twofold, 1 General. 1. General preparation for death.
2. Particular.

1 General, to prepare our selves to dye through the whole course of our life;
for we know not, neither the time of our death, nor the place of our death, nor
the manner how, whether of a sudden death, or of a lingering sickness. Therefore
all the days of my Job 14. 14.
appointed time will I wait, till my change shall come. The best Art of living
well, is to learn the Art of dying well. Balaam would dye the death of the
righteous, Numb. 23. 10.
and that his latter end might be like to his; but he did not care to live the
life of the righteous. I protest by our rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus
our 1 Cor. 15. 31.
Lord (said St. Paul) I dye daily. That is, in preparation for it; meditation
upon it, and expectation of it. This will keep us humble, and further our daily
repentance, and help us to be contented in every condition; and make us
watchful over our selves to fly and avoid Sin, careful to grow in Grace, and to
be frequent in Prayer to God, that He would teach us so to number Psalm. 90. 12.
our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. For if we would live for
ever, we must begin to live that blessed and everlasting life here before we
dye: to live the life of Grace here, which is the life of Glory begun. We all
with open face, beholding as in a 2 Cor. 3. 18.
glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to
glory, a^ by the spirit of the Lord; that is, we by faith contemplating the
glorious light of God's mercy, truth, power, etc. by which means we are made
like unto Hi^, in the glory of holiness, and newness of life, by the Spirit of
regeneration, which has its progresses in this life, until such time as it
comes to its perfection in the life everlasting.

^. Of particular preparation before 2. Particular preparation ^o^ death.
death; this contains three duties. 1. Concerning God. 2. Our selves. 3. Our
Neighbor.

^. Concerning God; to seek to be reconciled to Him in Jesus Christ. This
reconciliation is had by renewing our former faith and repentance. To see and
acknowledge that Visitation of sickness from God's hand; and usually it is for
sin. 1. Therefore make we a new examination of our hearts and ^am. 3. 3^.
lives; search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord. 2. Confess we our
sins to the Lord, and He will forgive the iniquity of our sins. If we confess
our sins, He is saithful and just to forgive 1 Psalm. 32. 5. Joh. 1. 9.
us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 3. Pray earnestly
unto God with sighs and groans of the Spirit, for pardon of sin, and that God
would assure us of it, and that He is reconciled to us in Christ Jesus our
Surety.

2. Concerning our duties to our selves* and that, 1. In reference to the Soul.
2. In reference to the Body.

1. In reference to the Soul, our duty is, to arm our selves against the fear
of death; as not thinking on the pa^gs of death (which Christ has sweetened and
sanctified to all His) but upon that blessed estate that is enjoyed after
death. And look upon death, not as it is se^ forth in the Law (so it is a
curse)* but as it is set forth in the Gospel, so it is an entrance into Heaven:
consider also what God has promised to the death of the Rev. 14. 13.
righteous; Blessed are they that die in the Lord, for they rest from their
labors, and their works follow them. As we die in the Lord, both our Bodies
and Souls are really joined to Christ (as it is expressed in the Covenant of
Grace): and though death make a separation of soul and body, yet neither of
them are severed from Christ, our mystical union and conjunction with Christ
our Head, endures for ever, etc. God, as He Isa. 43. 2.
is present with us in our sickness, so especially will He be with us at our
Death; when the holy Angels are especially also present with us, ready to carry
the soul into heaven.

2. In reference to the body; our duty is To seek to preserve life, to recover
health, as by Diet, Physic, (that is, such lawful means and worthy instruments
called thereunto) and this God requires of us to do.

3. Concerning our Neighbor, our duty is, Reconciliation where any difference
is; forgiving all men, and desiring to be forgiven by them; serting our
Families in order; making our Will, (which indeed much rather should be in the
time of our best health) 1 Kings 2. 2. 1 Chronicles. 28. 9. Genesis 18 19.
charging those of our Family to learn, believe, and obey the true Religion,
etc. Thus let us strive to honor God dying as well as living.

Now Secondly, of the second part, 2dly b^havi^^ Death.
which is a right behavior and disposition in Death; which is a religious and
holy behavior, especially toward God, when we are nearer the agony and pangs
of death.

This religious behavior contains Three especial duties.

1. To Dye in or by Faith, relying on Gods special love and mercy i^ Christ: As
the Israelites stung with the Number. 21. 8, 9.
fiery Serpents, looked to the brazen Serpent and were cured: So we, when we
find death to draw near, and his fiery sting to sting and pierce our hearts;
then let us fix the eye of a true and lively Faith upon Jesus Christ (the true
brazen Serpent) lifted up and crucified upon the Cross for our sins (and for
mine in particular); and so by death we shall Joh. 3. 14, 15*
never perish, but have everlasting life.

2dly, To dye in obedience to God; As we must live in obedience to God's
Cammandments, so must we dye: be ready and willing to go out of the world,
whenever God calls us; and that withour murmuring or repining: Imitating our
blessed Savior, who said, Father, not my will, but Thy will be Mat. 26. 39.
done.

3dly, The last duty is, To resign and render up our Souls into the hands of
God, as the most faithful keeper: So did our Savior, in the very pangs of
death, when the dissolution of soul Luke 23. 46.
and body drew on, He said, Father, into Thy hands I commit My Spirit; and so
gave up the Ghost. So Stephen when he Acts 7. 59.
was stoned to death said, Lord Jesus receive my spirit. And so being dead,
Joh. 11. 11. Acts 7. 60. 1 These. 4. 13. sob 7. 21.
we are said to sleep; which is by a Synechdoche, part for the whole. For the
body only, lies in the earth; Now I shall sleep in the dust; that is, my body
only. Let us then not fear death; Christ has taken away the sting of it from
all true believers; He has sweetened it unto us, and made it only a passage to
our Fathers house.

And I saw the dead small and great stand before God: that is, all without
exception, shall personally appear before God, and come to Judgment, of what
degree, rank, estate or condition soever, whether Emperors, Kings, Princes, or
Beggars; then there will be no distinction of persons; we must all nakedly
appear before this Tribunal, we must all appear before the Judgment Seat of
Christ; That every 2 Cor. 5. 10.
one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done,
whether it be good or bad. Observe the placing of the words, small and great;
the small are put before the great, to show that there will be then no
distinction of persons (as I said before), but all must promiscuously appear
before God: Then the high and great wicked ones, who here through the pride of
their countenance will not seek after God; God was not in Psalm. 10. 4.
all their thoughts: except to swear by His Name, or to curse God dam me; but
rather they think on their father Joh. 8. 44. Psalm. 2. 3. Jer. 5. 5.
the Devil, whose works they do; and drink healths to him, and wish the Devil
take them: so running on in the practice of all wickedness; that no cords or
bonds will hold them: They altogether break the yoke and burst the bonds: All
Laws both Divine and Humane they trample under foot. But then, when the holy
Angels shall most powerfully gather together from all quarters of the Earth and
Sea, all men; and set them before the Judge, even Jesus Christ; from whose fa^e
the heaven Rev. 20. 11. and 6. 14, 15. 16.
and the earth do ^ly away, etc. denoting the terror and Majesty of the Judge
Himself; when there shall be such a conclusion of all things: Then those high
ruffing Gallants, will strive to hide themselves in Caves and Rocks of the
mountains, and cry to the mountains and rocks to fall on them, and hide them
from the face of Him that sets upon the Throne, and from the wrath of the
Lamb. But all in vain, for there is no hiding place, but all must appear; and
Heb. 4. 13.
that before Him, before whom all things are naked and open; and so must be
judged according to their works: Which brings us to the Second Head, that is,
Judgment.

I need not prove that there shall be 2. Judgment.
a Judgment, although there are several reasons for it, besides the dictates of
our own Consciences; it is an Article of our Faith: And many places both in the
Old, and also in the New Testament, confirm it. For brevity sake I will only
cite the Texts, and leave them to be read out of the Bible. Read Dan. 7. 9, 10.
Jude 14. 15. Christ's Sermon in Matthew 24 and 25 Chapters. Acts 17. 31. and 1
These. 4. 16. Heb. ^. 27.

Now next, to speak what this last Judgment is.

In the end of the world, Christ the What is this Judgment.
Judge shall descend from Heaven in the Clouds, in the Glory and Majesty of His
Father, with His holy Angels; and all men shall be raised up again, which have
been dead from the beginning of the world; and they that remain alive shall
suddenly be changed; and so all shall be set before the Tribunal S^at of
Christ, who shall pass Sentence upon All; adjudging the Devils and all the
wicked to everlasting punishments; but shall receive the godly unto Himself,
that together with Him and the blessed Angels, they may enjoy everlasting glory
and happiness in Heaven.

Or more briefly thus: It shall be a manifestation of all hearts, and a laying
open of all things which men have done; and a separating of the wicked from the
godly, passing Sentence upon All, and Execution of that Sentence according to
the Doctrine of the Law and Gospel: Which will be a perfect deliverance and
perpetual blessedness to the Godly; and a casting of the Wicked and Devils into
everlasting Punishment. We will prove the several parts hereof out of the
Scripture.

1. It shall be a laying open of all things: For the Books shall be opened,
that the secrets of all hearts may be made manifest: As Rev. 20. 12. Dan. 7. 10.

2. There shall be a separation of the just from the unjust, as a Shepherd
separateth Mat. 25. 32, 33.
the Sheep from the Goats, setting the Sheep on his right hand, and the Goats
on his left.

3. This separation shall be by Christ the Judge: For the Father has committed
Joh. 5. 22.
all Judgment to the Son. And Acts* 17. 31.
God has appointed a day wherein He will judge the world by Christ.

4. There shall be a passing of Sentence; For Christ shall say to those on His
right hand, Come ye blessed, etc. and to those on His left hand, Go ye cursed,
etc.

5. There shall be an eternal Execution of this Sentence; for the wicked shall
go away into everlasting fire, but Mat. 25. 46.
the just into life eternal.

6. Both the godly and the wicked shall be judged according to the Law and
Gospel; that is, they shall be declared just or unjust before the Tribunal of
Christ. For the absolution of the just shall principally be according to the
Gospel, and shall be confirmed by the Law. The damnation of the unjust shall be
principally by the Law* and shall be confirmed by the Gospel. The Sentence on
the wicked shall be taken from their merits. The Sentence on the godly, shall
be taken from Christ's merits, applied to them by Faith; the testimony of whose
Faith shall be their works*

Q. When shall this Judgment be?

A. We know not the time: So ^aith our Savior, That day knows no man, Mark
13. 32.
no not the Angels which are in heaven, nor the Son, (that is as man) but the
Father only. Good conceals this day,

1. That He may exercise our faith, hope and patience; that believing in God,
we may persevere in expectation of the promises, and of the glorious
deliverance of the Sons of God.

2. That our curiosity may be restrained.

3. That we may be continued in His fear, in godliness, and careful performance
of our duty; that we be not secure, but always prepared, because we are
uncertain when ^^^ Lord will come.

4. That the wicked may not desser their repentance, because they know not the
day, lest the day take them at Mark 13. 35, 36, 37.
unawares, and unprepared: Therefore we are bid to watch, and to employ our
Talents well, until Christ Luke 19. 13.
come.

Let the Saints rejoice in God; for Christ will come; who will be a favorable
Judge unto us; for He is our Brother, our Redeemer, our merciful High Priest. He
will come in Majesty, and great Glory: He is able to save to Heb. 7. 27:
the utmost all that come to God by Him, etc. And He comes, as to reward
Vengance to His enemies; so to bring us Joh. 17. 24. and 12. 26.
unto Himself; that where He is, who is our glorious Head and Husband, there we
His servants may also be, etc. Wherefore seeing we look for such things, be we
diligent, that we may be found of Him* in peace, without spot, 1 Pet. 3. 14.
and blameless: Then shall we have cause to lift* up our heads and rejoice,
Luke 21. 28.
for our everlasting redemption draws nigh.

So we see, by Judgment here is meant, the pronouncing and executing of that
irrevocable Sentence, either of absolution or condemnation.

Judgment is Two* fold, 1st, Particular. 2dly, General.

1. Particular, on every man and woman, 1, Particular Judgment. Heb. 9. 27.
at the hour of death: As it is appointed unto all men once to dye, and after
death comes judgment: After H^^l. 12. 7.
death the body returns to the earth from whence it was; and the spirit to God
that gave it; there immediately to receive its Sentence.

2. General Judgment (of which we 2. General Judgment. Acts 17. 31.
here speak) upon all men, at the Second coming of Christ.

As the death of every one severally goes before their Particular Judgment: So
the General Resurrection of all, goes before their Final Judgment, which shall
be at the last Day; when all men both dead and living, shall be summoned by the
Voice of Christ, and Ministry of His Angels, and by the Shout and Trumpet of
the Archangel: Whereto the Lord joining His Divine Power, shall in a moment
both Raise the dead with their own bodies, and every part thereof, though never
so dispersed; and change the living, so that it shall be with them, as if they
had been a long time dead, and were now raised to life again. I say, both the
Elect and Reprobate shall rise by the same mighty Voice and Power ^^ Christ, in
the same bodies wherei^ they formerly lived; but so altered ^^ quality, as then
they shall be able to abide for ever in that estate whereto they shall be
adjudged.

But there shall be a difference between the Resurrection of the Elect and
Reprobate; for the dead in Christ shall 1 These. 4. 16*
rise first; and also the difference shall be:

1. The Elect shall be raised as members of the body of Christ, by virtue
derived from His Resurrection: The Reprobate as Malefactors, shall b^ brought
forth out of the Prison of the grave, by virtue of the Judiciary Power of
Christ, and of the curse of the Law.

2. The Elect shall come forth to everlasting life, which is called the
Resurrection of life: The Reprobate to shame, and perpetual contempt, which ^s
called the Resurrection of condemnation.

3. The bodies of the Elect shall be spiritual, that is, glorious, powerful,
^ctive, or nimble, impassible; never ^apable to suffer more; fashioned like 1
Cor. 15. 42* 43, 44, Phil. 3. 21.
unto Christ's glorious body: But the ^odies of the Reprobates shall be full of
^ncomeliness, gastliness and horror, agreeable to the guiltiness and terror of
their consciences, and liable to extremest torments.

4. The Elect shall with great joy be Luke 21. 28. 1 These. 4 17.
caught up into the air to meet the Lord: But the Reprobate, together with the
Devil and his Angels, shall with great horror and confusion be drawn into the
presence of Christ; then Rev. 6. 15.
the Books shall be opened; whereby we understand, partly the Omniscience of
God, or His knowing of all things; and partly the conscience of every man and
woman: And another book shall be opened, which is the book of life. Which is to
show that the salvation of the godly is not from their works, bu^ from the
eternal Grace of God, whereby they are written in the book of life.

The wicked shall have their unbelief and wickedness so laid before their eyes,
by the testimony of their own consciences, that they shall not be able to
contradict or deny any thing at all: I will reprove thee, says God, and Psalm.
^0. 21. Mat. 12. 3^.
set thy wickedness before thy face.

The Act of Judgment shall be performed two ways:

1. By examination. 2. By pronouncing Sentence.

1. By examination; and that, ^. By 1. Examination.
the Law of God, which has been revealed unto men; whether it be the Law of
Nature only, which is the remainder of the Law written in the hearts of our
First Parents, and conveyed by the Power of God unto all men, to leave them
without excuse; for the Romans 1. 20.
invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being
understood by the things that are made, even His eternal Power and Godhead, so
that they are without excuse. Or whether by the Law of God we understand that
written word of God, vouchsafed unto the Church in the Scriptures, first of the
Old, and after of the New Testament, as the rule of faith and life. For as many
as have sinned without Romans 2. 12.
Law, shall also perish without Law; and as many as have sinned in the Law,
shall be judged by the Law.

2. This examination shall be by the evidence of every man's conscience,
bringing all his works to light, whether they be good or evil; his conscience
bearing witness with him or against him; together with the testimony of such,
who either by their doctrine, company, or example, have either approved or
condemned him: Which Mat. 12. 27, 41, 42.
show the work of the law written in their Romans 2. 15.
hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean
while accusing or excusing one another.

But there shall be a great difference in the examination of the elect, and
examination of the reprobates.

For, 1. The elect shall not have their sins remembered, Christ having satisfied
for them: All their transgressions that Ezekiel. 18. 22.
they have committed, they shall not be mentioned unto them. Their
transgressions are forgiven, and their sins are covered. Psalm. 32. 1.
But their good works shall be remembered: I was hungry, and ye fed me, etc.
their good works do follow Rev. 14. 13.
them.

2. Because they be in Christ, therefore they and their works shall not undergo
the strict Trial of the law simply in its self, but as the obedience thereof
does prove them to be true partakers of the grace of the Gospel.

Thus we have seen the first Act of judgment, which is by Examination: Now of
the second Act, which is by the 2. Pronouncing of sentence.
pronouncing of sentence.

The sentence shall be pronounced by the Judge Himself our Lord Jesus Christ,
according to the evidence and verdict of conscience, touching works; who shall
adjudg the Elect unto the blessing of the Kingdom of God His Father: And the
Reprobates, with the Devil and his Angels, unto the curse of everlasting Fire.

So then, men shall be adjudged to salvation or damnation, for their works sake.

1. The wicked shall be condemned for the merit of their works; because being
perfectly evil, they deserve the wages of damnation. For the wages of Romans 6.
23.
sin is death.

2. The Godly shall be pronounced just, because their works, though imperfect,
do prove their faith (whereby they lay hold on Christ and His meritorious
righteousness) to be a true Faith: As Jam. 2. 18. Gal. 5. 6.
working by love in all parts of obedience.

This last Judgment is administered by Christ as a King: for the power of
judging is a part of the Royal Function.

1. In respect of the faithful, this Judgment is from Grace, and is a Function
of the Kingdom of Grace, essential to Christ as our Mediator.

2. But in respect of the wicked, From His Power and Dominion granted to Him by
the Father.

Hence it is (as I said before) the sins of the Godly shall not come into
Judgment; for in this life, by the Sentence of Justification; they are taken
away and coverd: And this last Judgment shall be a confirming and manifestation
of the same Sentence. Therefore it is not consentaneous or meet that they
should then be brought to light again.

Christ shall judge the world, not according Isa. 11. 3.
to the sight of the eyes, or hearing of the ears; But He is the knower and
searcher of all hearts; who can discern the Hypocrites from the truly Godly;
and He will do no wrong to any: The judge of all the earth will do Genesis 18. 25.
right. He will not acquit the wicked, nor condemn the just. He will manifest
the secrets of all hearts, and render to every one according to his works: then
shall the upright have praise of God.

Q Why must this last judgment be?

A. 1. Because of God's decree; He has decreed it, and said it shall be.

2. That God may obtain the end of creation of man: God made all men for His
glory; if wicked men would not glorify Him here, He will judiciarily be
glorified upon them in their everlasting confusion: God shall be praised and
glorified by His Elect to all eternity.

3. That God may show His perfect goodness and mercy to His Elect, who were so
excruciated, troubled, and afflicted here in this world, that they may 2 Thessalonians.
1. 8.
have rest.

4. For His perfect Justice and Truths sake, that He may show His Justice in
punishing the ungodly, who do flourish in this world, where they have all Luke
16. 25.
the good that ever they shall have. Therefore it must be according to God's
Justice and Truth in His Promises, that the righteous shall have recompense in
everlasting life, both in body and soul.

Q. But it is said, The Saints shall 1 Cor. 6. 2.
judge the world: And the Apostles shall sit upon thrones, judging the twelve
Luke 22. 30.
tribes of Israel.

A. I answer: Christ alone in His humane nature shall appear, judge and
pronounce the sentence on all, and execute it; yet not excluding the Father and
the Holy Ghost; God is invisible. For this judgment is the work of the whole
individual Trinity; but according to the visible act, promulgation, and
execution of the sentence, so it is the judgment of Christ. For Christ being
visibly seen of all, shall pass sentence, and execute it on all. But the Saints
are said to judge the world, because they shall applaud, approve, and wholly
subscribe to the righteous sentence of Christ.

Let us always live in expectation of the coming of the Lord Jesus, with Oil in
our lamp^, Grace in our hearts, and so pr^pared for it; praying, Come Rev. 22.
20 Luke 12. 43.
Lord Jesus, come quickly. Blessed it that servant whom his Master when He
comes, shall ^ind so doing: He shall say unto him, Well done, good and
faithful Mat. 25. 21.
servant, enter into thy Masters joy. But as for the wicked and ungodly, they 2 Thessalonians. 1. 9.
shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord,
and from the glory of His power. Which brings us to the third head we mentioned
at first, which is Hell.

Having spoken to the first two, 3 Hell.
Death and Judgment; come we now to the execution of the sentence of Judgment,
which shall presently follow the sentence given: the wicked shall go Mat. 25.
46.
away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous into life eternal.
Whosoever is not found written in the book of Rev. 2. 15.
life, shall be cast into the lake of fire.

This place of the damned, in Scripture is called by diverse names, 1. Hell, as
Mat. 5. 23. 2. A furnace of fire, where shall be weeping, wailing, and gnashing
of teeth, Mat. 13. 42. 3. A place of torment, Luke 16. 28. 4. A prison, 1 Pet.
3. 19. 5. A bottomless pit, Rev. 9. 1. 6. A lake of fire, Rev. 20. 15. 7. A
lake which burns with fire and brimstone, Revel. 21. 8. The place where Hell
is, we ought not to be too inquisitive to know, since it is not manifested in
the Scripture. But the extreme horror and dreadfulness of the place is
described unto us, that we may use all the means which God has prescribed in
His word, that we may never come there.

The word Hell, in Scripture has several acceptations; 1. It is taken for the
place appointed for the torments of the reprobates after th^^* ^ife. So Luke
16. 23, And being in hell in torments.

2. For most deep and deadly sorrows; Psalm. 18. 5, The sorrows of hell
compassed me about.

3. For Satan the Prince of Hell with the whole army of wicked Spirits, Mat.
16. 18, The gates of hell shall no prevail against, etc A Metonymie, signifying
all the power and policy, and strongest assaults of the wicked: for heretofore
they had their seats of Judicature in the gates of the City, where the Elders,
the wisest, and all the Sages met; and these gates of the City were, and still
are, the strength of the City.

4. Hell is taken for the grave, and the estate of the dead therein: So we have
it Psalm. 16. 10, Thou shall not leave Acts 2. 31.
my soul in Hell, etc.

5. For the belly of the whale, wherein Jonah was shut up as in a grave: Jonah
2. 2, Out of the belly of Hell cried I, etc.

By Hellfire is signified the whole extreme pain of the damned in Hell: where,

1. They are separated from the presence and glory of God.

2. They are punished with eternal confusion, and most bitter reproaches,
because all their secret wickednesses and sins are revealed. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 9.
Mat. 23. 41.


3. They have fellowship with the Devil and his Angels.

4. They are wholly in body and soul tormented with an incredible horror, and
exceeding great anguish, through the sense and feeling of Gods wra^^ Isa. 66.
24.
to be poured out upon them for ever.

Hereupon is the punishment of the damned called hell sire, a worm never dying,
but always gnawing on the Conscience; weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth,
and utter darkness, and such like.

By Hellfire is not meant any bodily flame; but these are Metaphors and
resemblances* for the weakness of our earthly and dull capacity, that we may a
little apprehend it, and have a glimpse of it, that so we may use our utmost
endeavors to avoid it. For as no tongue of Men or Angels can rightly set forth
the joys of Heaven; so no tongue can express the torments of Hell.

But these expressions of Hell, etc. signify the seizing of the fearful and
terrible wrath of the Almighty, both on body and soul, and all the powers and
faculties, parts and members thereof for ever. For howsoever the body be
subject to burning with bodily fire, yet the soul being spiritual, cannot burn:
and therefore Hellfire is not a material fire. A material fire yields light,
but here is nothing but blackness of darkness for ever. Hellfire is a most
grievous torment, fitly resembled by fire; which to our apprehension is the
most direful and dreadful thing: And torments by fire are of all others the
most fearful and terrible.



1. The quarrel with sinners is Gods own, the controversy His own, the
injuries and indignities have been done to Himself, and His own Son; the
challenges have been sent to Himself, and His blessed Spirit. And therefore no
marvel if He take the matter into His own hands, since He has been so provoked
to revenge it by His own immediate Power.

2. Revenge is His Royalty and peculiar Prerogative: To Him belongs Deuteronomy. 32.
35. 41. Heb. 10. 30, 31. Jam. 2. 13. Rev. 14. 10.
vengeance and recompense: Thence the Apostle infers, It is a fearful thing to
fall into the hands of the living God: and that for these reasons.

1. It shall be Judgment without Mercy; there shall be a cup of pure wrath
poured out upon them, without mixture, etc. that is, not a drop of sweetness
and ease, but all is poison and bitterness; there shall not be afforded ^^ drop
of water to a Lake of fire; a minute of ease to Eternity of torment.

2. It shall be in fury without compassion; that is, in vengeance without any
pity.

3. It shall be in revenge and recompense, in reward and proportion, and a full
and everlasting detestation. For as the wicked did here hate God, and set their
hearts and courses against Him and His Laws, in their eternity; in all that
time they lived and sinned here, and so would have done if they had lived never
so much longer: So God will hate wicked men, and set His face and fury against
them, in His eternity also; and punish them there with everlasting destruction.

3. The torments of wicked Angels, whence can they come? There is no creature
strong enough to lay upon them a sufficient recompense of pain and punishment
for their sins against Gods Majesty.

And for the disputes of Schoolmen about corporal fire in Hell, the degrees of
it, etc. they are but the niceties of men ignorant of the terror of the Lord,
Heb. 22. 29.
who is Himself a consuming fire.

The Devils acknowledged Christ their tormentor, when He did but rebuke them;
which wrang out from them Mat. 8. 29.
that hideous cry, Art thou come to torment us before the time? This terrible
fire, these hideous torments prepared for the Devil and his Angels, all wicked
Mat. 25. 41.
men must enter into, and remain in, and and that for ever.

Oh that dreadful word Eternity, never, never to have end! The damned might
think themselves some ways mitigated, to endure these horrible pains and
extremest horrors, more millions of years than there be sands on the Seashore,
or stars in the firmament, etc. they would still comfort themselves, with
thinking that their misery will once have an end. But alas! this amazing word [
Never] will rend their heart in pieces, with much rage and hideous roaring; and
give still new-life to those insufferable pains and sorrows which infinitely
exceed all expression or imagination. There are in Hell both Corporal and
Spiritual plagues and torments. The punishment of loss, and the punishment of
sense.

1. The pain of loss; the privation of Gods glorious presence, and eternal
separation from those everlasting joys, happiness and blessedness in Heaven;
which is a most unutterable and inexpressible torment.

2. The pain of sense; the extremity, exquisiteness, and perpetuity thereof, no
tongue can possibly express, or heart of man conceive. It does not only exceed
with an incomparable disproportion, all possibility of patience and resistance;
but also even ability to bear it: And yet notwithstanding, it must of necessity
be born, so long as God is God. They shall weep to see how that weeping it self
can nothing prevail; yea, in weeping they shall weep more tears than there is
water in the Sea; for the water of the Sea is finite, but the weeping of the
reprobates shall be infinite. Their Consciences shall ever sting them like an
Adder, when they think how God used all means for their Salvation, how Christ
wooed them by His Ministers to be reconciled unto God, 2 Cor. 5. 20.
offering them freely remission of sins, and the Kingdom of Heaven, if they
would but believe and repent: and how easily they might have obtained mercy in
those days; and yet they suffered the Devil, and the World, and their unruly
lusts, to lull them asleep, and keep them still in impenitency and unbelief;
and how the day of mercy and grace is now past, and will never dawn again.

Oh that men and women would timely and seriously think hereupon, that they may
never come into this place of torment, to lie as it were in fire and brimstone,
kept in the highest flame by the unquenchable wrath of God, and that for ever!
Where they shall have nothing about them but darkness and horror, wailing and
wringing of hands, desparate yellings, and gnashing of teeth: Their old
companions in sin and vanity cursing them with much rage and bitterness; wicked
Devils insulting over them with Hellish cruelty and scorn; the never-dying worm
of conscience feeding upon their Soul and flesh for ever and ever: the smoke of
their Rev. 14. 11.
torments ascending also to all eternity. This is the estate of the reprobates
in Hell; this is the second death: the general perfect fullness of all
cursedness and misery.

4. Come we to the last head mentioned, 4 Heaven.
Heaven: When Christ by His Almighty power, and Ministry of His Angels, has
cast the Devils and all the reprobates into hell; the righteous Psalm. 58. 10.
shall rejoice to see the vengeance, and glorify God in the confusion of His
enemies; and have cause then to say, Verily there is a reward for the
righteous: verse 11.
verily there is a God that judges in the earth. Then the elect shall be by
Christ carried up into Heaven, and put in possession of His glorious Kingdom;
where they shall be unspeakably and everlastingly blessed, and glorious in 1
Cor. 13. 10, 12.
Body and Soul: Being freed from all imperfections and infirmities; yea from
such graces as imply imperfection, as Faith, Hope, Repentance, etc. and endued
with perfect Wisdom and Holiness, possessed with all those rivers of pleasures,
Psalm. 16. 11. Rev. 3. 21. 2 Timothy 4. 8. 2 Pet. 3. 13. Psalm 17. 16. 1 Thessalonians. 4.
17. Heb. 12. 22.
which are at Gods right hand; seated as Princes in thrones of Majesty: Crowned
with crowns of glory, possessing the new-heaven and new-earth wherein dwells
righteousness; beholding and being filled with the fruition and enjoyment of
the glorious presence of God, and of the Lamb Jesus Christ, in the company of
innumerable Angels and holy Saints, etc.

The efficient cause of this eternal blessed life, generally is the whole
Trinity: But especially the Lord Jesus Christ, who by His merits has obtained
it for us, and by His effectual Power gives it unto us. Hence He is called the
eternal Father, or rather the Father Isa. 9. 6.
of Eternity. And the Lord our righteousness: Jer. 23. 6.
And He also calls Himself metonimically, I am the life. John 14. 6.


This eternal happiness shall be clearly seen, by our freedom from all evil
both of sin and suffering: and by the variety, greatness, and eternity of all
joys and happiness. God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes, and there
shall be Rev. 21. 4.
no more death; neither sorrow, nor crying neither shall there be any more
pain; for the former things are passed away.

The variety of those Heavenly joys may farther appear and be seen in these
following particulars: 1. In the glorification of the whole man, both Body and
Soul. 2. In the pleasantness and sweetness of those Heavenly mansions. 3. In
the blessed Society of the Angels and Saints. 4. But above all, in our
communion with God. To insist briefly upon these. The variety of Heavenly joys
appear,

1. In the glorification of our whole man. 1. Our bodies shall be endued with
impassibility (that is, never capable to suffer more) with nimbleness and
agility, with subtility and clearness, shining as the light, and as the Dan.
12. 3.
brightness of the firmament, and as the stars for ever and ever; and fashioned
like to Christ's glorious body. 2. Our Phil. 3. 21.
Souls shall be far more perfect; then shall we have understanding without
error, light without darkness, wisdom without ignorance, reason without
obscurity, memory without forgetfulness, etc.

2. The pleasantness and sweetness of these Heavenly mansions was shadowed by
the temple of Solomon; and the New-Jerusalem. Glorious things are spoken Revel.
20. 10, to 27. Psalm. 87. 3.
of thee, O thou city of God.

3. The blessed Society of Saints and Angels; we shall not only have a
communion Mat 22. 30. Luke 28. 36.
with them, but we shall be as Angels.

4. The communion we shall have with God, shall be such as we shall see Him
without end: love Him for ever, and praise Him without weariness: In Psalm. 16.
11.
whose presence is fullness of joy, and at whose right hand are pleasures for
evermore.

God so of His gracious good will distributeth glory, that none shall have
cause of complaint for want of glory, nor of envying others that have more.

Christ after the day of Judgment shall remain King for ever; for He shall not
so deliver up the Kingdom to His Father, 1 Cor. 15. 24.
that He shall cease to reign: But that He may represent to His Father, that
His Kingdom is complete, and shall remain so for ever. The meaning of those
words is thus, when Christ as Mediator, has been, established King of the
whole World, but especially of His Church, to gather together, govern, and
bring unto His Father all His Elect, and to destroy His enemies; shall have
brought His work to an end, and so deliver up the Kingdom to His Father, that
(as verse 28.) God may be all in all; that is, the Father, with the Son and
Holy Ghost in Unity of Essence and Glory, shall begin to reign immediately over
His Church, in a manner, altogether new; namely by Himself, without any outward
means, without the work of Angels or Men, Ecclesiastical or Political Orders,
as it is in this world; and likewise without any adversaries or oppositions;
filling all His with His light, love, life* and glory. Which indeed will not a
whit disannul Christ's Kingdom, but only change the meaner form thereof, into a
more sublime, majestical, glorious, and most perfect form, That God may be all
in all; that is, that God, the whole blessed Trinity, may immediately and
absolutely work fully, in all the Elect, who shall then be perfectly united
unto God; and that He may Possess, Govern, and Rule them for ever.

Now to speak a little, where these glorious mansions are, in Heaven.
Philosophers speak of ten Heavens; but we shall wave that, and speak according
to Scripture Phrase, and so there are three Heavens. 3 Heavens.


The first is, all that whole space from the earth, to the sphere of the Moon,
where the birds fly; therefore they are called the folws of Heaven: and whence
Mat. 6. 26.
the rain, hail, and snow, thunder and lightning, wind, and other Meteors do
descend. So God opened the Windows Genesis 7. 11. Deuteronomy. 28. 12.
of Heaven, and poured down rain upon the earth.

The second Heaven is, and consists of all those visible Orbs, where the (...)
or whole expansion is called the Firmament; Genesis 1. 14. 15. Genesis 1. 8.
and God called the firmament, Heaven: and in this God has placed the Sun,
Moon, and other Stars, which are called in Scripture the Stars of Heaven. Number.
3. 16.


The third Heaven is that where God is said especially to dwell, whither Christ
ascended, whither St. Paul in a 2 Cor. 12. 2.
rapture was caught up into this third Heaven, and where all the blessed ones
shall be for ever. This is the Heaven whereof we now speak.



The Papists feign a Purgatory, that Solution.
they may be purged from their sins: which is contrary to the Scripture. For
the Scripture teaches us, that not the sire of Purgatory after this life (of
which there is no mention made in Scripture) but the blood of Christ laid hold
on, and applied by a lively faith while we are here in this life, does cleanse
our souls from all sin: And 1 John 1. 7.
that the souls of the faithful after death are not thrust into a place of
torment, but that they are gathered unto Christ, into Abraham's bosom. The
meaning Luke 16. 23.
of [ into Abraham's bosome] is thus, it is the gesture of a good Father toward
his little and tender Children, to cherish them in his bosom. The souls of the
faithful presently after their departure out of the body, are carried by the
Angels up into heaven; into the communion of all true believers, of whom
Abraham was the Titular Father, and therefore called the Father of the
faithful. Romans 4. 16:


I say, That presently after death, the soul appears before God to Judgment,
Eccl. 12. 7.
either to be gathered into the Mansions of the blessed, or to be cast into
Hell, into the state of the damned; from whence there is no redemption: and
then truly are tormented in those infernal flames; but yet are reserved for
greater torments against the last Day, when soul and body shall be joined
together again. And for this the Scripture is very clear. So our Savior said,
Father into Thy hands I commit my Spirit. Luke 23. 46.
Stephen at his death kneeled down and said, Lord Jesus receive my Spirit. Acts
7. 59. Phil. 1. 23. 2 Cor. 5. 8:
Paul, desires to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which is best of all.
Therefore not in Purgatory. So the faithful are desirous and willing to be
absent from the body, that they may be present with the Lord.

And this is the last Article of Faith, as the Crown of all; I believe the life
everlasting, or that there is an everlasting life: which holds out these three
things.

1. I believe that after this life there shall be another life, in which all
the true members of the Church shall be glorified, and shall praise God for
ever and ever.

2. I believe that I am a member of this Church, and so shall be a partaker of
everlasting life.

3. That in this life I have by Faith, the beginning of everlasting life: For
Christ said, He that believes in Me, Joh. 3. 36.
has everlasting life: So this profit and comfort hence redoundeth unto me,
that in and through Christ I am justified before God, and am an heir of
everlasting life.

Q. Shall we know each other, and our Relations in heaven?

A. Mark the saying of the Apostle, Henceforth know we no man after the 2 Cor.
5. 16.
flesh; yea though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet hence^orth know we
Him no more: that is, not with an affection merely humane, civil, and natural;
but wholly with a Divine and spiritual affection, befitting the state of glory.

Having premised this, I answer in this Syllogism; We shall enjoy in heaven
every good thing, and comfortable gift, which may any way increase or add to
our joy and happiness:

But meeting in heaven with our old dear Christian friends, knowing of them,
and enjoying them, never to part more either with them, or all other the
glorious Inhabitants in those heavenly Mansions, will ravish us with sweetest
delight:

Therefore we shall know one another in heaven; nay our minds being abundantly
enlightened with all wisdom and knowledge, we shall be able to know not only
those holy persons of our former relation or acquaintance; but also such as we
never knew before in the flesh, even all the faithful which ever were, are, or
shall be. We shall be able then to say, This was Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob,
Samuel, David, etc. This was my Father, Mother, this was my child, etc. This
was he that occasioned my conversion, who taught me, etc. And this may clearly
be gathered out of Scripture.

1. For if Adam before the fall, had that measure of Illumination, That he knew
Eve, and from whence she came Genesis 2. 23.
at the first sight; much more we (who then shall be filled with the Holy
Ghost, and with wisdom) shall know each other, and all the Saints whom we never
saw before in the flesh.

Now we see as through a glass darkly, 1 Cor. 13. 12:
but then face to face; now we know in part, but then shall we know even as
also we are known.

2. If Peter, James and John, who accompanied Christ in His Transfiguration,
had then a taste and glimps of glorification, and were able thereby to know
Moses and Elias whom they had never seen, who lived many hundred of years
before; neither could they know their visage by statues or pictures, which was
a thing utterly forbidden to the Jews: but by the alone grace and favor of
God, which put into their hearts this immediate light of wisdom and knowledge;
How much more shall we, being fully enlightened, and perfectly glorified in
heaven, know exactly all the blessed ones, though never acquainted with them
here upon the earth?

3. Samuel being inspired by God, ^ Sam. 9. 17.
knew Saul whom he had never seen before.

4. John Baptist in his Mother Elizabeth's womb, leaped for joy, to Luke 1. 41.
hear the voice of the blessed Virgin, the Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ.

If the minds of these were so enlightened with the beams of the Spirit, and did
so; shall not we much more know each other in heaven, when all clouds and mists
of darkness shall be wholly taken away, and we shall be fully illuminated and
glorified?

5. Christ tells the Jews, That they Luke 13. 28.
shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the Prophets, etc. in the
kingdom of heaven, therefore they must know them.

6. And it is clearly gathered out of the Parable in Luke 16. 23, 24, 25, that
the Saints do know the Saints in the Kingdom of heaven: and the Reprobates in
torments do know each other.

In this knowledge each of other, the heap of reward increases. For as the
Elect do more and more rejoice when they see those whom they have loved on
earth, to rejoice with them; so the wicked in Hell, when they see whom they
dearly loved in this world, to be tormented with them; not only their own
punishment, but the punishment of those whom they so much loved in this life,
adds unto their misery.

Where-hence we conclude, that the glorified Saints, then plentifully endu'd
with all knowledge, and supernaturally enlightened by the Holy Ghost, shall know
each other, and those Saints also whom they never knew in the flesh. There all
men shall be known of every several man, of what Nation, Country or stock
soever he came; and every several man shall be known of all. We shall know the
spiritual substances, offices, orders, and excellencies of the holy Angels. And
the nature, immortality, operations, and originals of our own souls; yea, and
all things knowable. But above all, we shall be beatifically enlightened with a
clear and glorious sight of God Himself, which Divines call the Beatifical
Vision; which alone makes us blessed and happy for evermore: Beholding the
inexpressible glory of God, issuing from His glorious Face; whereby we shall be
wonderfully taken with His Beauty, and our souls inwardly ravished with the
things that we shall behold, with a delight of them: and nothing shall be able
to make our joys either to faint or to fail. Immediately after that Christ has
crowned all the Elect with crowns of glory, then every one taking the crown
from his head, shall lay it down at the feet of Christ, prostrating themselves,
and with one heart and voice, in a heavenly harmony shall say, Praise and
honor, glory and power be unto Thee O blessed Lamb, who set upon the
Throne: Who have Redeemed us to God by Thy blood; out of every kindred, and
tongue, and Rev. 4. 10. and 5. 9.
people, and nation; and have made us unto our God, Kings and Priests, to reign
with Thee in thy Kingdom for evermore.

O now let us look and long for this blessed estate, and this heavenly City,
whose builder and maker is God. Heb. 11. 10.


This was it which St. Paul longed for, to be dissolved, and to be with Christ,
Phil. 1. 23.
which was best of all. Every one would desire this blessed estate: Therefore
live the life of Grace here, else thou 2 Cor. 4. 17:
shall never live the life of Glory hereafter. Grace is glory begun, and glory
is grace consummate. Without holiness Heb. 12. 14:
none shall see God: Into that holy place, no unclean thing shall enter. Rev.
21. 27.
Therefore let us now strive to cleanse our selves from all filthiness both of
flesh and spirit, endeavoring to perfect holiness in the fear of God. In Rome
heretofore they must first pass through the Temple of Virtue before they came
to the Temple of Honor.

This honor have all Gods Saints. Psalm. 149. 9. Josh. 23 14.
And as not one good thing has failed of all that the Lord promised concerning
His Israel: So we shall have cause then Psalm. 37. 24.
to say, As the Lord has guided us by His counsel; now He has received us
into His glory. Therefore blessed be the Psalm. 72. 18, 19
Lord God, the God of Israel, who only does wondrous things: And blessed be His
glorious Name for ever; and let the whole world be filled with His glory. Amen
and Amen.

Lo, this is our God, we have waited Isa* 25. 9.
for Him, and He has saved us: this is the Lord, we have waited for Him, He
has brought us to His glory: we will rejoice and be glad in this His eternal
salvation.

Amen.
FINIS.
