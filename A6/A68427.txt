IN may quben Flora the fresche lusty queen
the snyl has cladde in read qubyte grene aright
And phoebus began to shed his stremes shene
Amydde the bule with all his bemes bright
And Lucifere to chase avey the night
Ayene the morrow or orisent has take
To bid loueris out of their sleep alvake.
And hertes hevy for to reconfort
From^ dreryhede and hevy nychtes sorrow,
Nature badde him rise and disport
Ayene the gudely glad gray morrow
And hope with saint Ihon^ to borow
Badde in despite of dangere and dispare
For to tak the holesmn lusty a^e
And with a siche I began to abreide
Out of my slombre and suddenly up slert
As he allace that neigh for sorrow deid
My seknes satt ay so neigh my heart
Bot for to find succoure of my smert
Or at the least sum relesche of my pain
That me so sore held in ewiry vein
I rose anon and thought I would gone
Into the wodde to here the birddes sing
Quhen that the mysty vapoure was al gone
And clear and feire was the dawing
The dew alsso like silvir in shynyng
Wpon the leaves as any balm suete
Til sire Tytan with his psant hete.
Had dryet up the lusty licoure new
Wpon the heibes in the grene meid
And that the flowers off many diverse hew
Wpon their stalks gonne^ for to spreid
And for to splay out their leves in breid
Ayenes the soii gold burned in his spear
That dou^ to them cast his bemes clear.
And by a ryuere com^ I forth costey
Of wat^ cler as berial or cristalle
Til at the last I fond a lytil wey
To^art a park enclosyt with a wall
In compass round and by a gate small
Quho lo that would freely might gone
In till this park wallit with grene stone
And In I went to here the briddes long
Quhithe in branchis and in plane vale
So loud sond that a^ ^^e land rong
Like as it schuld shew^^ in pecis small
And as me thought that the nyghtgale
With lo great might her wice began out breast
Right as her heart for love would to breast
The s^yle was pleyn^ smoht and wound soft
Al over spradde with t^pitis that nature
Had maid her selue siluered eke aloft
With bewis grene the flouris for to cure
That in their beauty they mow long endure
From all assaut off phoebus fervent sere
Quhiche in his spear so hoote schene and clear
The air attemper and the smoth wynd
Off phoebus among the blosu^mes quhite
So ^ools^m was and nor ysing be kind
Thate small briddes and round blomes lyte
In manner began off their breath delight
To gyfe ws hop that they fruit shall take
Ayene autompne reddy for to shake.
I saw the ^aphyn closed wnd rynde
Grene laurere and the holsum pyne
Chemyrre also that wepeth ewir of kind.
The hey cydryce up right as a line
The filbart eke that law doith inclyne
Her belwis grene unto the erd ado^^
Wnto her knight callit demephoun^
There saw I eke the fresche haw thorst
In quhite ma^^e that so suete does smell
A^^he fyrre and ache with many a yhong accorn^
And many a tree mo than I kan tell
And me beforn^ I saw a litill w^ll
That had his course as I can bihold
Wndyr a hill with quyk stremes cold
The gravale like gold the wacter pure as glassh
The bounkes round the well enveronnyng
And sost as velvet the yhong grass.
That there upon lustely began ^pring
The nombre of treis about compaising
There shadew cast closing the well round
And all the herbs growing on the ground
The watter was so hoolsum and virtouse
Throu myt of herbs growing be side
Naught liche the well quhere as Narcisus
Slayen was throw vengeance of cupide
Quhere so coniunctly he did abide
The greyn of death upon the brynk
For death mot follow quho that ever it drynk
No liche the pute of pegate
Wnder pernaso quhare that poets slepte
No like the well of pure chastity
Quhiche as dyan with her nymphs kept
Quhen sche nakit in the water lept
That slew anceon with her hundis fell
Only for he come so ney the well
Bot this well that I here reherce
So hoolsum was that it wald asuage
Belyng hertes and the venym prese
Of pensyffe head with all the cruel rage
And evermore refresche the visage
Of hem that worcester in any heuinese
Of great labor or follen in distrese
And I that had throu danger and dedeyn
So dry a thryst thought I would assay
To taist o draught of this well or tueyn
My bitter langur if It might alay
And on the bank anon down I lay
And with my head unto the well I raught
And of the water dronk a good draught
This herbere was full of flours of ynde
In to the quhiche as I byholde can
Atuix one hoser and o vvod bynd
As I was war I savv quhere lay o man
In blak and quhite cauloure pale and wan
And wonder dedely was he alsso of hew
Off hurtes grene and fresche wounds new
And evermore ^istreyned with siknese
Beside all this he was full greuoulely
For upon him he had a great accese
That day by day him shoke^ul p^^ousely
So that sore constreynt of his malady
And hertly woe thus lyand allone
It was a death for to here him groan
Quhereof astonaid my foot I began with draw
Gretely woundryng quhat it myht be
That he so lay and had no ^elaw
Ne that I houth no wight with him se
Quhereof I had reuth and eke pite
And can anon so softly as I koud
Among the buskes me privily to ^chroud
If that I might In any wise aspy
Quhat was the cause of his dedely vvo
Or quhy that he so pitou^ely gau cry
On his fortune and his ^^re a^^lo
With all my might I leyd mine ere to
^ui^y vvouid to me^k quhat he ^eid
Out of his suouche among as he ab^e^d
^ot first if I schuld make mention^
Of his perloun and plenely him disc^yue
He was in sooth with out exception
To speak of manhede one the belt on live
Thore may no man ayene t^^euth strywe
For off his time and off his age alsso
He preved was there men schuld have ado
For one the best both off bread and leuth.
So well ymaid be good proporcioun
If he had been in his deliwir streuth
Bot thought and seknes were^ occasion^
That he thus lay in lamentation^
Grouffe on the hround in place desolate
Sole by hymselue he wept and was mate
And for me seems that It is sitting
His wordis all to put in remembrance
To me that herd all his compleynyng
And all the ground off his woeful chance
If there with all I may do you plesance
I woll his wordis right as I can anon^

Or quho schall now my stilegy or led

Of pitouse woe and my hond eke quake
Quhen that I write eke for this ma^is saik
For unto woe accords compleynyng
And dule full chere unto hevinese
To sorrow alsso syking and weping

Bot as I herd quhen that I was present
This man compleyn^ with a p^touse son
For ewyn^ like with out additioun^
Off disseuere^ other more or lose
For to reherce anon I well me drese.
And if that any now be in this place
That feel in loving bryinyng of feruence
Or hendrit war in to his lad^s grace
With falls towng^ or with pe^^lence
To see true men that newir did offense
In word nor deid in their intent
If any suiche be here now in present
Lat him of reuth lay to audience
With duleful chere and sobre countenance
To here this man beful he sentence
His mortale woe and his pturbaunce
Compleyn now lynig in a trance
With luke wp cast and with re^ful chere
Theffecte of quhiche was as yhe schall here
The thought oppressit wytht in wart sikes sor^
The peynful lyffe the body langwising
The woeful ghost the heart rent and tore
The pitouse chere pale in complenyng
The dedely face like asshis in shynyng
The salt teris that from^ mine eyn^ fall
Plain can declare the ground of my peyn^ all.
Quhois heart is ground to bleid in hevinese
The thought refette of woe and compleynt
The breast is chist of dule and drerynese
The body eke so feeble and so feynt
With hot and cold mine axes is so meynt
That now I chill for defaut of heet
And hoot as gleid now suddenly I sueet
Now hoot as fire and cold as asses deed.
Now hoote from^ called and cold from^ hot ayene
Now cold as yse now hot as coals read
For heet I brynne and thus bituix tueyu^

So that my cold pleyenely as I feel.
Off grevaunce cold is cause ewiry dele
This is the caulde of inwart hie distress
Cold of dispite and cold of cruelle hate
This is the cold that does his besines
Ayenest treuth to fight and to debate
This is the cold that would the fire a ba^e
^f true menyng allace the hard quh^e
This is the cold that would me begile.
For ewir the bett that I treuth meant
With all my might feithfully to serve
With heart and all to be diligent.
The les thank allace I can deserve
Thus for my treuth dangere does desterue
For one that schuld my death of mercy let
Has maid dispite now his suerd to quhett
Ayenes me and his arowes file
To tak vengeance of wilful cruelte
And tovngis falls throw their slightly wile.
Have goun avvere that wol not styntid be
Of falls envy of vvreth and innymyte
Have conspirit ayenes all ryt and low
Of their malice their throv Ishcalbe sllow
And malebousche gone first the tale tell

And falls report so loud rong the bell

So that allace wrongfully he dies
And his place now falsnese occupies
And entered is in to treuthis land.
And has there of fully possessioun^
Of yt full god that first the treugh fond
How may you suffer suiche oppressioun^
That falsehede schuld have iurisdictioun^
In treuthis ryt to slay him giltlese
In his franchise he may not lyve in pese
Falsely accused and of his foon foriugede

To excuse treuth now in ward to speak
To feith nor soth the judge list naught se
Their is no gayn bot he wol be wreke
A lord of treuth to the I call and clepe
How may thou se thus in thy presence
Withouten mercy inurihit innocence
Now god that art off treuth souueraine
And seist how I lig for treuth ibound
Sore knett in loves fyere cheyne
Evyn at the death ouergirt with many o wound
That likly been flewir for to sound
And for my treuth am damned to ye death
And not to abide bot drow longere thy breath
Consider and se in thine^ eternale right
How that mine heart professyt sum time was
For to be true with al my full myhht
Only to one the quhiche now allace

Mine accusoures has tak unto grace
And cheriseth thaym my death to purchase.
Qubat meneth this quhat is this vvound vvre
Off purveyaunce If I schall it call
O god of love that false thai so assure
And true allace down of thy quheil be fall
And yhite in soth this is the worst of all
That wrongfully false head of treuth has she name*
And treuch ayenwart of falshede berth the blame.
This blind chamise this stormy adventure
In love has most his experience
For quho that does with treuth moist his cure
Schall for his meid find moist offense
That serves love with all his diligence
For quho can feyne wnd loulyhede
He falls naught to find grace and spend
For I louet one full long sithen gone
With al my heart body and full might
And to been deed my heart can naught gone
From my behest bot hold that I have hight
Though I be banyst out of her sight
And by her mouth dampened that I schal dey
Wnto my behest yhite I woll obey
For ewir sithen that the world bygan
Quho so lust luke and in storye read
He schall ay find that the true man
Was put abak / quhere as y^ fall head
yfurtherede was for love takes now head
To slay the true and has of them no charge
Quhere as the false goith freely at his large
I tak record off palamydes
The true man the noble wourthy knyt
That ewir loved and of his peyn no relese
Naught wythstonding his manhede and his myt
Love unto him did full great vnryghe
For ay the bett he do in chiualrye
The more he was hendryt be envy
And ewir the bett he did in eviry place
Throw his knythede and his besy peyn^
The ferthir was he fro his ladiis grace
For to her mercy might he nevir acteyne
And to his does he coud It not refreyne
For no dangere bot ay o bey and serve
As he best coud pleynly till he sterue
Quhat was the fine alsso of Hercules
For all his conquest and his worthynese
That was of strenth alone pereles
For like as books list of him exprese
He set pilers throw his hey prowes
A way at gaddis for to singnyfy
That no man might him pass in chenalry
The quhiche pileris been far be yond Jnde
ysett of gold for a remibraunce
And for all that yhite was he set byhynd
Myth them that love list ^^billy avaunce
For him set last upon adaunce
Ayenes quhois help may none stryve
For all his treuth yhite he lost his lyve
Phoebus also with all his psaunt light
Quhen that he went here in erd low
Wnto the heart with Menus sight
ylvoundit was throw Lupidis olvn^ bow
And yhite his lady list naught him to know
Though he ^o: her love his heart did blede
Sche leit him go and tuke of him no heide
Quhat schall Isey of yhong Pyramus
Offtrew trestram for all his hey ^nown^
Of Achilles or off Antonyus
Offarcite or of him palamoun^
Quhat was the end off here passioun^
Bot after sorrow death and than their grave
Lo here the guerdoun that this loueris have
Bot falls Jasoun with his doubilnese
That was untrue to kokes to med^^
And the^^^s rute of vnkyndnese
And with these two eke the false enee
Lo thus the false ay in o degree
Had in love there lust and al there will
And save falsehede their was none other skill.
Off thebes eke the false arcite.
And demephoun^ eke for his sleuth
They had their lust and all that might delight
For all their falsehede and great vntreuth.
Thusewir love allace in that is reuth
His false legis furtherith quhat he may
And sleith the true vngudely day by day
For true adone was sleyn^ with the bore
Amyd the forest in the grene slade
For venus love he felt al ye sore
Bot vlcanus with her no mercy maid
The foul chulle had many nyghtes glade
Quhere mars her knyt and her man
To find mercy nor confourt none he can
Alsso the yhong fresch ypomenes
A lusty fre as off his courage
That for to serve with all his heart he cheise
Athalamice so feire of her visage
Bot love allace quyt him so his wage
With cruel danger pleynly at the last
yat with the death guerdounlese he past
Lo here the fine off loves service
Lo how he can his seruand quyte.
Lo how he can his feithfull men despise
To slay the true and falls to respite
Lo how he doith the suerde of sorrow bite
In hertis such as most his lustis obey
To save the false and do the true dey
For feith ne oath word nor assurance
True menyng a wait nor besinese
Still port ne faithful actendaunce
Manhede no myt in arms worthinese
Pursoyte off worschip nor no hie prouesse
In strong long rydyng nor trauale
Full lyte or naught in love does avale
Perele nor death in see nor a land
Hunger nor thrist sorrow nor seknese
Ne great emprise for to tak on hond
Sheddnig of blude no manfull hardinese.
Nor often wounding at savtes by distrese
Nor in partyng in lift nor death alsso
Al is for nonght love takes no heid thereto
^ot losingeris with their slatterye
Throw their fallehede and with their doubilnese.
With tales new and many tenyeit lic
By false semblaunce and count fetid humblesse
Wnder color depeynt with stedefastnese
With fraud cowert wnder a pitouse face

And began them self best magnyfye
With fenyeid port and presumptioun^
They change there cause in falls sucquydry.
Ondir menyng of double ententiousi.
To think on in their opynioun^
And scy they ought to set h^^ selue aloft.
And hender treuth as It is seen full often
The quhiche thing I by now al to der^
Thounkid be venus and bir god Cupide
As It is seen by my oppressit chere
And by his arawes that s^iken in my side
That sane death I nothing abide
From^ day to day alloce the hard quhsle
Quhenewir his dart that him list to file
My woeful heart for to ryve a two
For fault of mercy and lak of pite
Of her that causes all my pain and woe
And list not ones of grace for tose
Wnto my treuth for her cruelte
And most of all yhste Inte complain.
That sche has Joy to lauche at my pain
And wilfully has my death I snorn^
Al giltelese and woot no cause quby
Save for the treuth that I have had aforne
To her allone to serve most feithfully
A god above unto the I cry
And to thy blind doublen deite
Of this great wroung I complain me
And to thy stormy wilful variance
Mengit with change and get vnstabilnese
Now wp now doun^ so rynnyng in thy chance
That the to trist may be no sikenese
I wit It no thing bot thy doubilnese
And quho that is one archere and is blind
Merheth no thing bot shuteth be the weynd
And for that he has no discretioune
Withoutyn a wise helattith his arow go
For lakke of sight and alsso of resoune
In his schutyng it hapeth often so
To hurt his friend rathare than his foo
So does this god with his scharp stone
The true sleith and lets the falce gone
And of his wounding this is the worst of all
Ouhen he hurts he does so cruel wreche
And makes the sike for to cry and call
Wnto his foo for to been his leche
And hard it is for a man to seche
Wpon the point of death in iupardye
Wnto his foo to find remedy
Thus fares now euynly by me
That to my foo that yaue my heart o wound
Moot are mercy grace and pite
And nomely there quhere none may be found
For now my sore my leche woll confound
And god of kind so has set mine bre
My lives foo to have my woe in cure
Allace the quhile now that I was borne
Or that I saughe ever the bright son
For now I se that full long a forne
I was borne my destan^e was spunne
By percas syscryn to slay me if they koune
For they my death shapen er my shert
Only for treuth I may it not aster^
The mighty gods alsso of nature
That under god has the governance
Of wordly things co^^u^t it to her cure
Disposes has throw their wise purueyaunce
To yif my lady so much suffiliaunce
Of al vertous and there with all purueyde
To murthir treuth has tak danger to gide
For b^unte beauty schap and semebly head
Prudence wit and passingly f^^ren^se
Benyng port glad chere with loulyhede

Ouhan sche by: wrought and al their last dysedeyne
To hendre treuth sche maid her chamberleyne
Ouham to my sche if and fal^s suspectioun
With mile bileue ^che maid for to be
Then of (...) his conclusion
For to exile reuth and eke pite
Out of her court to make mercy fle
So that dispite holds forth his reyne
Throw hasty bileve of tales that men feyne
And thus I am for my treuth allace
Murtherit and sleyne with wordis scharp and kene
Gylthes god woot of all trespase
Andlig and blede upon this cold grene
Now mercy suete mercy my lyvis queen
And to your grace of mercy yite I prey
In ^hourc service that your man may dey
Bot if so be that I schall dey algate
And that I schal none vy^ mercy have
And of my death lat this be the date
That be yhoure will I was brought to my grane*
Erhastely if that ye list me save
My scharp woundis that ache alsso and blede
Of mercy charm and als of woman head
For other charm pleynly Is there none
Bot only mercy in to this case
For though my wound blede ewir in one
My life my death stant all in yhour grace
And thought my gilt be nothing allace
I ask mercy in almy best intent
And reddy to dee if that yhe assent
For there ayenes schall I newir stryve
In word no werk pleynly I ne may
For lynar I have than to be a lyve
To dee sothly and it be her to pay
yha though it be this ilke samy day.
Or quhen that ewir her lust to devise
Suffisith me to dee in her service
And god that knowetst ye thought of ewiry wight
Right as it is in ewire thing thou may se
yet er I dey with all my full might
^ouly I prey to grant unto me
That ye gudely fair fresche and fre
Quhiche sleith me only for defaut of reuth
Or than I dey yhe may know be my treuth
For that in sooth suffiseth wnto me
And sche it know in ewiry circunstance
And ester I am well apayed that sche
If that her list of death to do grevance
To me that am under her legeance
yhite schal I not her dome discobey
Quhere so her lest to do me lyve or dey
With outyn gruching or rebelliousi
In will or word holy I assent
Or any manner of contradictionne
Fully to be at her co^maundment
And If I dee in my testament
My heart I send and spirit alsso
On hat ewir sche lust with yaim for to do
And aldirlast to her woman head
And to here mercy I me reco^maund
That lig now here betuir hope and dred
Abiding plenyly quhat sche list command
For vtrely this nys no demand
Welcome to me quhil me melestith breath
Ryth at her chose quhethir It be life or death
In this matere more quhat might I seyne
Since in her hond and in her will is all.
Both life or death my joy o: all my pain
And fynaly my heste hold I schall
Till my spirit be destyne fatal
Quhen that her lest fro my body wend
Have here my treuth and thus I make ane end
And with that wourd he kan sike as sore
Like as his heart would ^ybe atueyne
And held his piece and spak o word nemore
But for to se his woe and mortale pain
The teeris began from mine ee^e reyu^
Full pitousely for verray in wart reuth
That I him sangh solauguissnig for treuth
And all this quhile my self I kept close
Among the leves and my self began hyde
Till at the last the woeful man arose
And to luge went there beside
Quhere all the may his custom was to habide.
Sole to complene of his peynes kene
From year to year wnd the leaves grene
And for the cause that it drew to yt nyt
And that the sone his ark diurnale
ypassyt was so that his persaunt lyt
His bryt bemes and his stremes all
War in ye wawes of the wacter fall
Wnder the bordour of our occiane
his chare of gold his course so swiftly rane
And quhill the twylyght and ye rewis read
Of phoebus lyt werre^ deaurat alite
I took a pen and began me fast sped
The woeful pleynt of this man to write
Word be word as he did endyte
Like as I herd and koud him to report
I have here set yhour hertis in disport
Oyfoucht be mys ley the wite on me
For I am worthy for to bear the blame
If anny thing mys report it be
To make this dyte for toseme lame
Through my vnkonnyng bot for to seem the same
Like as this man his compleynt dit exprese
I ax mercy and for gefnese
And as I wrote me thought I sow a far
In to the west lustely appear.
E^perus the goodely bright sterre
So glad so feire so psaunt eke of chere
I mean venus with her bemes clear
That hevy hertis only to relefe
Io wount of custom for to schew at eve
And I als fa^^ fell down^ on my knee
And evyn to her thus I kan prey
O lady venus so feire upon the sea
Lat not this man for his treuth dey
For that Joy thou had quha thowley
With Mars thy knyt quha that vlcanus fond
And with a cheyn vnvisible you bond
Togider both tueyne in the same quhile
That all the court above celestiale
At yhoure ^chame began la^ch and smyle
A feire lady well willy fond at all
Comfourt to careful o gods immortale
Be helping now and do thy diligence
To let the stremes of ynie influence
Descend down in furtheryng of thy threuth
Nomely of thaym that be in sorrow bond
Show now thy might and of there woe have reuth
Or falls dangere sle him and confound
And specialy lat thy might be found
For to s^ccure quhat so thou may
The true man that in the herbere lay
And al true men thou furthyr for his saik
O goodly sterre o lady venus mine
And cause his lady him to grace tak
Her heart of ste^le to mercy so inclyne
Or that the bemes go up to declyne
And or that thou go now fro w^ adoune
For that love thou had to adone
And quhen that sche was gone to her rest
I rose anon and home to bed went
For verily me thought it for the best
Preying thus in all my best en^ent
That al true that been with danger schent
With mercy may in relesche of there pain
Recouerit be or may cum eft ayene
And for that I may no longer wake
Fare well yhe loneris all that been true
Pre^yn^g to god and thus my le^f I tak
That or the son to morrow be risen new.
And or he have ayne his rose hew
That each of yhou may have s^^che a grace.
His ol^^n lady in arines to enbrace
I mean thus in all honest
With out more yhe may to gidd speak
Quhat so yhou list at good liberte
That ^^h may till vthir there heart break.
On Jalousy only for to b^lwreke

Werreid treuth with his tyranny.
Princes plesith to your benignite
This litil dyte ho have in mind
Of woman head also for to se

And pite eke that has long be by hynd
^at tha^ in a yen be provoked to grace.
For by my treuth it is ayenes kind
Falls danger to occupy his place
Go litil quare go to my lyvis queen
And to my verrey hertis souueraine
And be right glad for sche schal the seen
Suiche is thy grace bot I allace in pain

And was abaisit in her humyl sprete
Wnto the angel having this langage

Be naught perturbit in thine aduertence
Thy benygne ere unto my voce inclyne

The virtue of the haly gaste dyvyne
Within thy wame sall obumbit and schyne
