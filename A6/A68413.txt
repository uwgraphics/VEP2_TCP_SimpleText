To the right Worshipful Sir Fraunces Drake, Knight, N. L. G. wishes all
prosperity.
THey have an ancient custom in Persia (the which is also observed throughout
all Asia) that none will enterprise to visit the king, noble man, or
perticularly any other person of countenance, but he carries with him some
thing to present him with all worthy of thanks, the which is not only done in
token of great humility and obedience, but also of a zealous love and friendly
affection to their superiors and well willers. So I (Right worshipful
following this Persian president) having taken upon me this simple translation
out of the Porti^gale tongue, into our English language, am bold to present and
dedicate the same unto you as a signification of my entire good will. The
history contains the discovery and Conquest of the East Indias, made by
sundry worthy Captains of the Portingales, in the time of king Don Manuel, and
of the king Don John the second of that name, with the description, not only
of the country, but also of every harbor apperteining to every place whereunto
they came, and of the great resistance they found in the same, by reason whereof
there was sundry great battles many times fought, and likewise of the
commodities and riches that every of these places does yield. And for that I
know your worship, with great peril and danger have past those monstrous and
bottomless seas, am therefore the more encouraged to desire and pray your
worships patronage and defense thereof, requesting you with all to pardon those
imperfections, which I acknowledge to be very many, and so much the more by
reason of my long and many years continuance in foreine countries. Howbeit I
hope to have truly observed the literal sense and full effect of the history,
as the Author sets it forth, which if it may please you to peruse and accept
in good part, I shall be greatly emboldened to proceed and publish also the
second and third book, which I am assured will neither be unpleasant nor
unprofitable to the readers. Thus always wishing your good worship such
prosperous continuance and like fortunate success as God has hitherto sent
you in your dangerous travail and affairs, and as may every way content
your own hearts desire, do even so take my leave.

From London the fifth of March. 1582. Your worships always to command,
Nicholas Lichefield, Gentleman.

TO THE MOST HIGH and mighty Prince our King and fouereigne, Don John, the
third of that name, king of Portingale, and of the Algarues, etc.
IT has seemed to me so strange and weighty a thing (most high and mighty
Prince our king and Sovereign) to undertake to write of the most worthy and
valiant acts which the Portingales have enterprised in the discovery and
conquest of the Indias, that oftentimes I thought to give over and relinquish
the same, but as the attempt and doing thereof was principally taken in hand
for the glory of Almightye God, and to convert those barbarous Nations to the
Christian Faith, and the great honor of your highness, wherein God gave them
(by his Omnipotent power, favor and mercy (such fortunate success in the
atchieuing of those famous acts, without whose great providence it could
never have been performed or brought to pass. And therefore do hope and
altogether comfort my self with the aid and assistaunce of his divine
goodness in publishing the same by writing, yielding the glory thereof only
to his celestial Godhead, and the praise terestriall unto your excellent
highness, and to that famous and most happy king, Don Manuel your Father. And
although the same be well known and spread abroad over all the world, yet it
cannot be so perfectlye published unless it be set forth in writing. For by
this means the memory thereof will endure for ever, because that the writings
will always show the same to be present. Like as it does continue those acts
of the Greeks, and of the Romans, the which long since is past so many years.
And therefore they like wise men, perceiving the same to be true, did travail
all that was possible to leave the memory thereof by writing, and noting that
the worthiness of the same did consist much in the eloquence of the writer,
did therefore choose such excellent learned men as those were that wrote the
same, being thereto aided with much favor and help, of others that were
nothing inferior unto their own, and possible were far greater, but for that
the same did not remain in writing, there is no memory thereof, even as those
of the Assyrians, of the Medes, of the Persians, of the Affricans against the
Romans, of the Sweuians against Julius Caesar, of the Spaniards against the
Moors in the recouerye of their Country of Spain. Principallye of those
invincible and holy Kings of Portingale your ancestors, the King Don Alonso
Henriques, the King Don Sancho his son, the King Don Alonso, the which did
gettte the Kingdom of Portingale, and of the Algarues, in the which conquest
there was wonderful great acts done, and that by force of Arms. Of all the
which almost there has remained no memory of that there should have been,
yea, those matters of the Indyas, the which was done but yesterdaye, there is
no man that has the same in memory more then four persons, so that if they
had dyed, all the same had ended with them, the which would have been
imputed to their great shame and rebuke.

And I having a regard, and partlye a remorse to see this loss, did therefore
determine my self to note of those notable acts, the which your subjects has
done in the discovery and Conquest of the Indias, of whose valiantness there
is none of their progenitors of any age or antiquity that ever did exceed
them, no, nor yet were equal with them. For leaving a side the Conquest of the
Semyrian of Cyro, Pirhus, and of other barbarous, all (the which was nothing in
comparison of this) and take amongst them also that great Alexander the which
was so feared and wondered at throughout all the world, since that the Indias is
frequented by the Portingales: their doings are no more meruailed at, then a
dead Lion in respect of one alive, for the Conquest of Alexander was all by
land, and against people that were smallie accustomed or trained in the feats
of wars, he always going in his royal person, but this of the Indias was
done by sea, and that by your Captains, being upon the same a whole year,
and eight months, and at the least six months, not along or near any
coast, but by the bottomless and great Ocean Sea, and departing from the
lymites of the Occident, and bearing sail always toward the Cape De las
Playas, or such like, without discovering or seeing any other thing, but only
the heavens and water, going round about all the Sphere, a matter never before
attempted by any mortal man, nor yet almost imagined by any, to put the same
in practice, and they having past great hunger, thirst and other infirmityes,
besides that every day with those furious storms and raines, in danger a
thousand times of their lives. And as I say, they having past those fears and
dangerous troubles by sea, yet after their arriual into the Indias, found
themselves in great and cruel battles, (not with men that did sight only
with their Bows, Arrows, and Spears,) as they did in Alexanders time, but
with such as were stout and of a hauty stomach, and with men that were
experienced in the wars, of the which kind of people there is not only in the
Indias, but as far as we can understand, there is of the like in Asia, and
besides their accustomed weapons (the which are many and good) yet they have
Ordinance, Caleeuers, and many fire-workes more plenty then the Portingales
had, so that the power of these men was always so great, that the force of
king Poro with whom Alexander did fight, was not comparable, yet
notwithstanding the Portingales did give them continually the overthrow,
although their strength was but small, yet they never left the wars, as
Alexander did. And leaving off to declare of the Greeks and of their acts,
and now to come to the Romans, who with their huge army, and with their
great Fleet, the which seemed to cover the whole Sea, thought to conquest the
whole world, yet they never durst adventure by Sea further then the red Sea,
neither yet the greatest of their famous victoryes, did or was ever like unto
the least of those battayles that was done by our men in the Indyas, in the
which it is so well known, most invincible Prince, the great prosperitye of
the King your Father and you, so that without moving of your self out of your
pallaice, was discovered and conquered by your Captains, the which never
Princes could by themselves conquer or discover, so that there was never
Conquest of the Barbarous, nor of the Grecians, nor of the Latynists, the which
was of like difficulty as this has been, neither yet Kings nor Captains,
of none of all these Nations, was so equal in force nor yet in valiantness
as those of your Father, and of yours, the which is manifestly declared by the
discourse of the history following.

And touching their great acts which they did worthelye fulfill and bring
to pass, we must verelye believe that it was Gods good will and pleasure,
that those Barbarous, being discovered with their vain Idols, and with the
false sect of Mahomet, should join themselves with the Catholic faith, and
to be as it were in one Coral, and under one Pastor or Shepherd, as at this
present the great multitude that hereby are increased to the Christian
Religion, is a manifest testimony and witness thereof. After which great
exploytes, your Highness gave commandment that the Christian doctrine of the
Brotherhood of the company of Jesus should be there instructed and taught them,
of the which your Highness has had so special a care like a most godly and
Christian Prince, that not only you were the first that commanded the same to
be brought from Rome, for that they might be the better instructed in all
their Kingdoms, but also does maintain upon your own charges in this holy
company the multitudes that does daily submit themselves to the same. As we
do see in the sumptuous College of Coimbro, where to ennoble and augment the
honor of your kingdoms, you have erected and founded an University: where,
with the charges that is daily done there, and with your countenance
together, it is hoped, that the same may be accounted amongst the flourishing
Universities of all Europe: whereas there is maintained also upon your charges
many Colleges of the order of poor begging Friars, and others of like
profession, for like as the reformation that was there made was profitable to
them all: so he commanded, that there should be many Divines for to declare
the Euangelycall law, which your Highness is not only at this charges with
religious men, but also with temporal men, for as there is many of your
subjects that does defend ye state Republike or Commonwealth, and does enlarge
the same with their armor, so there are others that does beautify the same
with learning. These heroycall virtues of your Highness being so well known
unto me, for so much as this Book, besides others that I have made, has some
taste or kindred of learning, does encourage me the more to set them forth, for
that as I say, there may remain a perpetual memory of so notable acts as so
many Gentlemen and Knights of the Portingales your subjects has done, the
which has benefited me very much, my being in the Indias, where I trauayled
with my Father, who by your Highness commandment was sent thither to serve as
a Judge. And for that I spent all my youth in learning, and gave my self
greatly in reading of ancient Histories, and having seen and read a great
part thereof, did then immediately procure to know and with all diligence did
my best endeavor to understand what had been done in the Discovery of the
Indias, and in the Conquest of the same, by the Portingales, with the intent as
aforesaid, which was to make the same known, and common to all men: by means
whereof, and through the instructions of sundry Gentlemen and Captains, many
things came to my knowledge, by such persons as were then and there present, as
well in the counsel for the provision for that which should be done, as also
in the execution thereof, and otherwise by many letters and pamphlets, the
which were written by men of great credit, and likewise examined as sufficient
witnesses for better credit of the work. Moreover, I did not only use this
dilygence in the Indias, but after my coming to Portingale did the like. For
as those matters the which I meant to write of, were many and of sundry
orders, so it was necessary to inform my self of the same by many: and
beside that those that gave me this instructions were sworn, yet I was licensed
to present them as witnesses. There were of them that I sought in the most part
of Portingale: for what with the great travel of my person, and expenses of my
goods, for that they were separated in sundry parts, and in this I have spent
the most part of my life, for so much as this was my only recreation, having
joined together all these informations, since my being in the University of
Coimbro, in your Highness service, at such time as I found my self not occupied
with the executing of my office, with great trouble (not only of the body, but
also of the spirit) made an end of this Book with others, the which I do
humbly offer unto your Highness, whom God (after many and most fortunate
years, remaining in your place the Prince) take and receive you from the
senurie of the earth, unto the joys of heaven.

Your Highness most humble Orator, Hernan Lopes de Castaneda.

How the King Don Joan the second of that name, did send to seek out by sea
and by land the East India, and of the news that was brought him of the same.
Cap. 1.
THIS King Don Joan the second of that name, and of the Kings of Portingale,
the thirteenth, perceiving that all the Spices, Drugs, Stones, and other
riches, which came to Venice, were brought out of a certain Province of the
East part: And as he was a Personage of an hautie stomach and valiant mind,
so was he desirous to enlarge his Kingdom, and increase the Christian faith,
and therefore he determined to discover by Sea, the Country, from whence so
great plenty of riches came, that thereby his Subjects might be enriched, and
his Kingdom of Portingale enjoy all such commodities as came from thence to
Venice. Moreover, to discover the same Country, he was the rather animated and
inclined, for that he was given to understand, that in the East India, where
Christians, which were governed by a King of great power called Praesbiter
Joan, with whom Don Joan thought good to have acquaintance, and to know him by
his Ambassadors, and the rather for that he was reported to be a Christian
Prince: And therefore consulting with the Cosmographers of that time, he gave
them in charge to proceed and go forward by example of others, which had
sailed along the Coast of Guynee, which Coast was before that time discovered
by commandment of the Prince his Uncle, The order of Christ in Portingale
given unto Noble men and Gentlemen and to some that are made knights.
Master of the Order of Christ, who had sent for that purpose, one Bartholome
Dyas, one of the Officers of his Storehouse in Lyshborne, who did discover that
great and monstrous Cape, not known of our Ancestors, which is now called
the Cape of Buena esperansa: And finding there matter of great terror and
dangers, he passed beyond the same, one hundred and forty leagues, where,
coming to a River, which he named Rio del infant, from thence he returned to
Portingale. In this voyage, he gave to the Ports, Herbours, and Rivers, where
he took in fresh water, their names, which at this present they do retain.
Likewise, he erected there certain marks with Crosses, and with the royal
Arms of Portingale, and the last that he erected, was in a Rock, the which
they named, El pennol de la crus, which stands fifteen leagues on this side
the foresaid River. And from thence he returned without hearing any news, or
yet having any further intelligence of that India, by reason all the
Inhabitaunts along those Coasts be almost a savage and a wild kind of
people, and of color black.

This voyage and intelligence, being intimated and revealed to the King Don
Joan, he forthwith minded to (...) cover that India by land, albeit before
that time he (...) and sent for the same discovery intended, (...) of the
order of Saint Fraunces, called Friar (...) Lixbona, by land, in the company of
a (...) two persons, for want of the Arabian (...) travail those parts, so
that they went (...) Jerusalem, from whence without (...) of that journey, they
returned into Portingale.

The King nevertheless continuing to prosecute to effect his determination for
discouerye of that India by land, Another journey by land attempted.
did therevppon choose two of his own servants, men of good knowledge, and
dilygent in whatsoever they were to be employed, the one called Pedro de
Couillian, borne in the said Village, and the other called Alonso de Payua,
borne in the Town of Castil Blanco, which did very well understand the
language of Arabia, to whom he told how that he had made choice of them, as
of persons apt to execute his pretense, which was to discover by land as well
the Country of Presbiter Joan, as also that, from whence the Drugges and
Spices come to Venice: Giving them in charge, and that earnestlye to make
dilygent enquirye; and gather certain knowledge whether that from the Cape of
Buena Esperansa forward there were any Navigations to the East India, and that
they should set down all things they found necessary to be known, or
that they could by any possible mean learn or gather of the same for
certaintye: Commanding also a Sea Card to be given them, which was taken out
of a Ma^pe of the whole world, by a Master of Art, called Calsadilla,
Bishop of Vyseu, who was a good Astronomer.

Moreover, he gave them a Letter of credit, whereby they might be succored
and protected from, and in, dangers of death, and in cases of necessity and
want of money, in whatsoever Kingdoms and Countries their hap should be to
travail. And for their charges, he commanded to give them four hundredth
Crowns out of the Chest of the Orcherd of Almeryn: Of which sum, they took
as much as they deemed would suffice for their expense, until they came to
Valencia in Aragon, putting the residue in the Ba^cke of Bartelme Florentine to
be delivered them there: and so he gave them the blessing of God and his, in
the presence of the King Don Manuel, who at that time was Duke of Vesa.

After this they departed from the Village of Santaren the seventh day of May,
in the year of our Lord, a thousand four hundred four score and seven, and
came to Naples upon Saint John's day the same year, from whence they were set
forward on their way, by Cosmo de Medicis sons, and so went they from thence
to the Rhoodes, of which Religion, were then none other but Portingales. And
from the Rhoodes they went to Alexandria, from thence to the Cayro, as
Merchaunts, and from thence in the company of certain Moors of Feez, and
Tremencen, they came to Toro, which is a place that has his harbor in the
Straights of the red Sea in the Coast of Arabia, at the foot of the Mountain
Sinay, where they understood mainie matters of the Indias, and of the trade
those places had out of the Straightes to Calicut: and thereupon they travailed
to another place in the self same Sraightes of the Red Sea, over the Coaste
of Aethiopia, from whence they went to Edin: And for that it was out of the
way to the Indies, they parted company and severed themselves: Alonso de
Payua remained to go over by land to the Emperor of Aethiopia, Presbiter Joan
by error, is the very Emperor of Aethiopia.
which is he, whom we before have named upon error Presbiter Joan: for the
certainty is, this is he of whom Marco Paulo makes mention in his book, who
governs all the Indies, and whose Country joins unto the great Came of
Catayo, where in a battle between them fought, the said Prester Joan was
vanquished and dyed. And so thencefoorth finally ended his Kingdom, so that in
these days, there is in truth none of that name or race that reigns or
governs. It is to be understood, that Alonso de payua did verily believe,
that this Emperor of Aethiopia, was this supposed Presbiter Joan, by reason he
was informed and had intelligence that the same Emperor was a Christian, and
the People of his Kingdom were also Christians, as hereafter I shall declare,
when occasion shall serve.

For which cause, I am in opinion, y^ Alonso did depart toward his Court,
taking order and determining with Pedro de Couillian, that at a time appointed
they should meet in the great Cayro: This conference and determination between
them so had and accorded upon, Pedro de Couillian went toward the Indies in a
ship of the Moors of Cananor, and being come to the Indies, he went to the
town of Calicut, and to the Islands of Goa, where he gathered perfect
information and intelligence of the spices which they have in the Indies, and
of the commodities which come from other places, and of the like sort of
Towns which were there in the Indies, of all which he set down the names in
the Card he carried with him, albeit ill written. And after he had seen those
places, he went to Sofala, where he gathered knowledge of the great Island of
San Laurenso, which the Moors do call La ysla de la Luna: And seeing the
people of Sofala, to be black as those of Guynee are, he thereupon surmised
that all that coast was subdued, and that they might go by Sea to the Indias,
and therefore returning thence, he went to Ormuse, and so to Cayro, where he
understood that Alonso de Payua was dead: And being desirous to return to
Portingale, by chance he met with two Jews of Spain, the one called Raby
Abraham, borne in Vesa, the other Joseph, borne in Lamego: These after the
departure of Pedro Couillian and Alonso de Payua, from Portingale, told the
King Don Joan, that they had been in the Cayro, and understood there much
news of Ormuse, and of their tract had with and into the Indies: Whereupon the
King sent letters by Raby Abraham to Pedro Couillian, and to Alonso de Payua,
declaring that his pleasure was, they should return in the company of those
Jews, if they had seen all those things, whereof he gave them charge and
commandment, at their departure: if not, that then they should send by
those Jews a declaration, and true report what they had seen, and had
intelligence of: And moreover that they should procure to atteine to the sight
of Presbiter Joan, and also show and inform what they could concerning
Ormuse to Raby Abraham for that he had sworn by his law never to return to
Portingale, unless he first saw the same: Upon receipte of which letters
and message, Pedro de Couillian his purpose of retourning to Portingale was
then stayed: And therefore he forthwith dispatched Joseph with letters to the
King, his Lord and Master, wherein he related and fully declared in every
respect what he had seen in the Indias, and of Sofala: and likewise he sent
the Card in which all the Towns names were put down, that he had seen:
Informing also the King Don Joan, that the Emperor of Aethiopia is he who is
supposed to be ye Presbiter Joan: But I am of opinion, that in Portingale
remains this name of Emperor of Aethiopia, for that in his kingdom he is
not called by the name of Prester Joan, as I will hereafter declare: When
Joseph was departed, Pedro de Couillian, with Raby Abraham, went toward
Ormuse, and thence to the straights of the red sea, and having showed to the
same Raby those places and situation thereof, Pedro Couillian then sent him to
Portingale, with letters to the king, importing what he showed him, and how
that he himself was determined to make his voyage to Presbiter Joan, and
after this pursuing that his intent accordinglye, he came to the presence of ye
Emperor, that then there reigned and governed, whose name was Alexander, of
whom he was very well received, The king of Portingales letters delivered to
the Emperor of Aethiopia
and when he had presented unto him the letters of the king Don Joan, he
accepted the same very joyfully, in that they came from a Christian Prince so
far distaunt from his Country: Howbeit he gave to the same little credit,
and yet nevertheless he gave unto Pedro de Couillian, great honor and gifts:
and when he was in readynesse to depart thence, and expected lisence for the
same, which he had requested, and should have been granted him, the Emperor
then deceased: after whom succeeded in the Empire another named Nahu, he
could not by him be lycensed to depart thence, neither yet of his son
David, who was Emperor also, and succeeded Nahu: so that Pedro de Couillian,
remained in that Country, and never after returned into Portingale, neither
yet the King Don Joan ever heard or understood more of him, and therefore
supposed him to be dead. Only there remains the information of his
travails, which he had set down and written in the letters which the Jews
carried: After this came to Lishborne a Friar out of the Country of Presbiter
Joan, to whom the king showed great courtesy, and upon whose report, and
great relation made of that country, the king then determined to proceed in,
and follow the discovering of the Indias by Sea, and therefore he commanded
two little Ships to be made, committing the charge of that preparation, and
appointing for ouerseer or surueiour of the Timber then cut for that purpose,
one Joan de Braganca his servant borne in the woods, in a village called
Daluor, and was brought to Lishborne to the house of the Myna, in the year of
our Lord a thousand four hundred nintie five, the five and twenty day of
October in the same year: and afterward did succeed in that Kingdom, the
most high king of glorious memory Don Manuel, by whom also it appeared that
he was there elected by divine providence for discovery of those Countries and
Provinces, whereby the Christian faith is so greatly increased and enlarged,
and the royal house of Portingale so mightily honored, and the subjects of
the same so plenteously enriched.

How King Don Manuel the first of that name, prepared after the decease of King
Don Joan, to discover the Indias by one Vasco de la Gama, and by other
Captains, and how they departed from Lyshborne. Chap. 2.
THE King Don Joan being dead, Don Manuel then succeeded him, in whom
appeared a higher stomach, and more valiantness of mind (for atteining of
things impreagnable and making trial, and executing matters that passed common
capacity of man, and above the retch of natural knowledge) then was in
Alexander the great. Don Manuel now come to the crown, and earnestly minded
and bent to prosecute that which his predecessor Don Joan had begun, for
discovering of the Indias, and being therein greatly furthered by such matter,
order, and intelligence, as he found, and were left by the late king for
Navigations to those far countries: he then commanded that Fernan Lorenso,
Treasurer of the house of the Myna, should cause to be made and prepared of the
timber which was bought in king John's time, two ships, whereunto after they
were finished, he gave the names, to the one, the Angel Gabriel, being of an
hundred and twenty tun: and to the other Saint Raphael, a ship of one
hundred tun. And to go in the company of these ships, the King then bought
of a Pilot that was borne in Lagus, called Berrio, a Caruell of fifty tun,
which had and bare the self name of the Pilot: Moreover he bought a ship of
two hundred tun, of one Airs Correa. These Ships thus made ready and
prepared, and the king then being in Monte mayor the new, with his first wife
the Queen, Do^na Izabel, in the year a thousand four hundredth nintie seven,
he then gave the chief Captain ship of this voyage unto the Indias to Vasco
de la Gama his servant, who also before was servant to Don Joan, and borne in
the town of Synis, a harbor town in the fields of Dorricke. The same was a
man experimented in matters of the Sea, and of Navigations, wherein he had done
to this kingdom great service. And forasmuch as he was a man of great courage
and valor, and therefore very apt and likely to atteine and atchieue the end,
y^ was by the king desired, the king then accordingly in presence of many noble
personages, to his great praise, and no less encouragement, commanded him,
when he gave him the charge of that journey, earnestly also requiring him, to
answer and satisfy the expectation and credit he had conceived of him and
reposed in him, which if he did, he would then very largely reward that his
endeavor, and travel, and so liberally deal toward him, as he should
find himself satisfied for that his diligence and service employed: and for
some proof of those princely and loving speeches, he then began to make
performaunce of part thereof, at that very instant, giving him an Encommenda,
with money to put himself in a readiness for that voyage: And for to go with
him, the king also dispatched one Paulo de la Gama, brother to the Captain
General, and one Nicholas Coello, both of them the kings servants, and men
meet and apt for whatsoever matter of enterprise or cause of valiantness:
Moreover he appointed one Bartholome Dyas, to go with them in a Caruell to the
Myna: And for that in the ships of war, sufficient victuals for the people
in the same, could not be carried further then to a place called Saint Blaze,
where they must of course take in fresh water, the king gave commandment that
the ship of Airs Correa should go laden with victuals unto that place in
the company of the Fleet, and there to take out the same, and then to burn
the said Ship. The Captain General thus informed, and dispatched, departed
with the other Captains from the Kings court, toward Lishborne, The number
of persons in this voyage.
where the ships being in a readiness, he embarked his company, being one
hundred forty and eight persons, in Belen, one league from Lishborne, upon the
Saturday being the eight day of Iulye, in the year of our Lord God, a
thousand four hundred nintie and seven. At which imbarking all the religious
men of our Lady Church in Belen, which is a Monestrarie of Saint Hierome, went
in Procession bare footed, and in their cowles with wax Candles in their hands
praieng, and the most part of the people of Lishborne with them, al of them
weeping and pitieng those that so embarked themselves, supposing they should all
die in that so aduentrous and dangerous voyage, as in deed the p resumption
and common opinion thereof was great, and no less to be adjudged of The
General and other his Captains with their people so embarked; and by the
multitude and company then present, commended to God and good fortune, they
forthwith made sail and departed: The Captain General went in the Ship
called Saint Gabriel, having Pilot for ye same, one Pedro de Alanquer, which
was Pilot with Bartholome Dyas, when he went to discover ye river called El ryo
del ynfante: The brother of the Captain general, went in the ship called S.
Raphael: Nicholas Coello went in the Caruell Berrio, and one Gonsalo Gomes,
servant to the Captain general, went for Captain of the ship that carried
their victuals. Thus being set forward and under sail, the Captain general
commanded, that if by any hap whatsoever, they should be severed and loose
each other, they should every one make, and keep, their root or course to Cabo
Verde, where they would join themselves together again. And so following
their voyage, they came within eight days after to the sight of the Islands of
the Canaries, from whence going over against the River called Ryo de Oro, the
night did grow so dark, and such great tempest and storm rose as they lost
each other, and therefore they returned their course toward Cabo Verde, and
Paulo de la Gama, Nicholas Coello, Bartholome Dyas, and Gonsalo Gomes, having
met, and after eight days failing together, they came to sight of their
Captain General, upon the wednesdaye in the Evening, and saluting him with
many shot of ordinance, and with sound of Trumpets, they spoke unto him, each
of them heartely rejoicing, and thanking God for their safe meeting, and good
fortune in this their first brunt of danger and peril: The next day being
the twenteth day of July, the Captain general with all his Fleet, attained
unto the Islands of Sancty Ago: where coming to anchor in y^ play de Santa Maria,
they remained there seven days, taking in such water as they had need of, and
repairing the yards of their ships and other harms they had received in the
storm past. Tewsday being the third day of August, the Captain General
departed thence, following his course to the East, but first before his
departure he took his leave of Bartholome Dyas, Bartholome Dyas returns into
Portingale
who returned into Portingale: And going toward the Cape of Buena Esperansa,
with all the ships of his company, he entered the goulfe into the Sea, and
from thence sailed all August, September, and October, in which time they
sustained many and great tempests, or rather torments of outrageous winds and
rain, so that they expected nothing but present death, which still was
represented before them by view of the manifold dangers and perils, they
presently then saw, and whereof they were forced to abide the euenture: Being
thus perplexed, God of his divine goodness recomforted them, for upon the
saturdaye, being the fourth day of November at nine of the clock in the
fore-noone, they saw land, whereat they greatly reioysed, and all the
Captains being together, they then saluted the General, all of them
apparelled in their best araie, and having decked and garnished their ships
with Flagges accordingly, they drew near the land as the general had
commanded, who was desirous to have landed: Howbeit for that they did not know
the land, he commanded them to cast about a sea board, and so they passed
along by the same until tewsdaie following, at what time they came to perfect
view and sight of the land, perceiving the same to lie low, and that there
was a great bay, which as it was a convenient place for the ships, so he
commanded them to fall to an anchor there, of purpose to take in water: And
afterward they named it the Island of Sancta Haelena. Description of the people
and manners of Saint Helens Island.
The people of the country within the said Island, as our men afterward found
the same: be little men, ill favored in the face, and of color black: and
when they did speak, it was in such manner as though they did always sigh,
their apparel is of beasts skins made after the manner of the French
Cloakes, they trust up and hide their members in certain Cases made of wood
very well wrought.

They have for arms or weapons certain staves of an Oak tree bathed or
toasted with fire, at the ends whereof are horns of beasts, somewhat burnt or
hardened with fire, also serving them for swoords, and wherewith they do hurt
their enemy. These people do maintain themselves with roots of herbs,
with Sea Woulfes, and Whale fish, of which the country there has great
plenty, and likewise of sea crows, and sea mewes: Also they do eat of
beasts, which they call Gazelas, and of doves, and other beasts and birds
which they have in the land: They keep also dogs as those ben of Portingale,
barking after the same manner: The General thus lyeng at Anchor, commanded to
go round about the Island, to see if there were any river of sweet water,
and finding none, he then sent Nicholas Coello in his boat along the coast to
seek out water, which he found four leagues of from thence, the which he
named Sancty Ago, from whence the whole Fleet provided themselves of fresh
water. The next day the General and the other Captains, and some of their
company went a shore, intending to see and view what manner of people they
were, that inhabited that country or land, and whether they could inform him
how far from thence the Cape of Buena Esperansa was, which he knew not,
neither was the head or chief Pilot of that voyage of any certeintie which it
was, for that in the voyage, wherein he went before with Bartholome Dyas, he
departed in the morning from the Cape into the Sea, and past the same in the
night, with a forewinde, and at his first going, came not near the Shore: By
reason whereof he did not know the land, notwithstanding, he coniectured and
deemed it not above thirty leagues distaunt from thence at the uttermost: The
General being disimbarked and come to land, and walking there he ouertooke a
man, one of the inhabitaunts of the same, who was going to gather honny at the
foot of a bush, where the Bees made the same without any hiue, with this man,
ye general returned unto his ship, right well contented, thinking he had gotten
by him an interpreter, but it happened not so for there was not any of that
company could understand him: The General commanded to give him meat, and he
did both eat and drink of all that was given him, and when they saw he
understood none of their languages, nor any of them had any understanding of
his, he was the next day set upon the shore well apparelled, from whence he
went as it appeared, amongst others his country men, for that y^ next day then
following, (upon show of himself to them) there came about the number of
fifteen of his Country men, where our ships were: At sight of which the
Captain general went to land, carrieng with him Spice, Gold, and Pearl, to
make trial, whether those people had any knowledge of the same, or of any part
thereof: but by the little estimation they seemed to make of those things, it
appeared they had no knowledge of the same. Then they gave them bells, little
rings of tin, and counters, and of these things they were very glad, and from
thence forward unto the next Saturday following, very many of them repaired to
our Fleet, and those people so returning to their Towns, one of our men
desirous to see the same, and to view the order and manner of their lives,
craved then license of the General to go with them, whose petition, albeit he
was very unwilling to condescend unto, yet vanquished by importunity, he
granted the same. Fernan Veloso (for so was his name that was licensed) then
going in their company, they took a Sea Woulfe, which they roasted at the foot
of a hill, and supped altogethers: Treason by these men imagined against ours.
after which it then appeared, that they of that Country had armed themselves,
and practiced treason against our men: for so soon as they had supped, they
caused Fernan Veloso, to return to our Fleet again, which was hard by, and
when he was departed from them, they followed and came after him a little and a
little, the manner whereof, Fernan espieng and fearing, he therefore hasted to
the water side, and hailed to our ships: The General then being at supper, and
hearing that call, and looking out to landward, saw those savage people
coming after him, and presently imagined they meant him harm, and therefore
forthwith he commanded the whole Fleet to put themselves in battle array,
and he himself with certain others, went to landward without any weapons,
deeming verily that those black men meant him no harm, nor would offer any
force: and indeed when they saw our boats coming to the shoreward, they
began to run away, with a great clamor and outcrie, and so did many others
also which lay secretly hidden amongst certain bushes there, which policy
they used to train our men the rather to land, for when ours were disimbarked
and landed, they then returned and furiously set upon them, shooting their
darts, and using their other weapons in such sort, as they enforced our men to
retire to their boats and imbarke themselves, and that in have, taking with
them Fernan Veloso, which being done, the Negroes returned to their towns,
having hurt the Captain general and three others, who afterward remaining in
that road four days, could not see any more of those people, and therefore
could not use any revenge, for the damage they had done them.

How the Captain general doubled the Cape of Buena esperansa, and what happened
until they passed the River called El Ryo del Infant. Cap. 3.
THE Fleet having taken in fresh water and flesh which they needed, the
General and the rest then departed thence upon the Thursday being the
sixteenth day of November, in the forenoone of the same day, making their
way into the Sea, with a South southwest wind, and upon the Saterdaye then
next following in the evening, he came within sight of the Cape of Buena
esperansa, and for that the wind was contrary, as being then Southwest, and
the Cape lyeng Northeast Southeast, he made his return into the Seawarde,
whilst the day did endure, and when the night came, he cast about toward
the shore, and so in that order he sailed until the Wensdaye following, which
was the twentieth day of November in which time he doubled the Cape: And going
along the Coast with a fore wind, he passed with great pleasure of sundry
pastimes, and in sounding of the trumpets in all their ships, chiefly having
their whole confidence in God, by whose divine furtherance, they hoped to find
out, and attain to that which they sought for: So passing in this sort along
that Coast, they saw upon the land great store of Cattle, whereof some were
large, some small, but all of them were grown and fat: Howbeit there appeared
to them no Towns within this land, by reason that along those Coasts there are
none situated: but further within the same, there be Towns and Villages
inhabited, the houses whereof are all of earth covered with straw. The people
are of color somewhat black, and be apparailed as those of the Country of
Sancta Helena, speaking the self same language, and using the self same sort
of darts, with some other weapons also for their defense, and anoyaunce of
their enemy. This Country is very pleasant with Trees and Waters, and
joining to this Cape on the South side, there is a great Harbor, which
reaches into the Land six leagues, and at the entering it contains well as
much more. The Cape of Buena esperansa being thus doubled, the Captain
General forthwith upon the Sundaye after, The watering of S. Blaze
which was Saint Katherins day, came to the Watering of Saint Blaze, which is
three score leagues beyond the Cape, being a very great Baye, and passing
good for all Winds, except only the North wind. The people here are
somewhat black of color, they cover themselves with skins, they fight with
Darts of wood tosted or hardened in the fire, and use for Swoordes, Horns
and Bones of Beasts, and also they use Stones to defend themselves against
their Enemies. In this Land be many Elephauntes and great, also Oxen many
both large of stature, and very fat, whereof some have no horns: and upon the
fattest and fairest of the same, the people do use to ride, sadling them with
pannells stuffed with the straw of Rye, as the manner is in Spain, and upon
the same they put a certain frame of wood, and so use it as a saddle to ride
upon, putting through the noses of such of them as they will sell, a piece of
wood, of that kind whereof they make their arrows. In this Harbor three
Crossebow shot from the shore, Sea vvolfs most firce and terrible beasts
within the Sea, lies a Rock, in the which there be many Sea Woulfes, which
are as large in bigness as great Bears, they be terrible, having great and long
teeth, also so wild and fierce, that they do forcible set upon men: their
skins be so hard that no spear can pearce the same, albeit it be forced upon
it with great strength and valor: they are like unto Lions, and their little
ones cry like young Goats, there be so many of them in y^ Rock, that when
our men went thither of pleasure one day, they saw of them at that instant, the
number of three thousand little and great. In this Rock also be many Stares,
which are as great as Duckes, but they do not fly, by reason they have no
feathers in their wings, and they braye like unto an Ass. The Captain
General being come to this Port or Baye, and lieng at Anchor there, caused the
ships which carried their victuals, to be discharged thereof, and bestowed
the same in the others, commanding those Vessels to be then burned, as it was
ordained and commanded by the King in that behalf. In doing whereof, and
other things also which were necessary and needful to be looked unto, and
foreseen, for their more safety in the rest of their voyage, they remained
ten days in that place, where, upon the Friday next after the Captain
general and the rest had arrived, there appeared unto them, about the number of
four score and ten men of that Country, some along upon the lands, and some
upon the top of their Mountains, which when the General saw, he and other
the Captains went to the shore ward, and all the company of the ships went
armed in their boats, carrieng ordinance with them, as fearing the like
chance y^ happened to them in the Island of Sancta Helena, the Boats then
drawing near to the shore, the General threw on land little belles, which
the Negroes took up, and some of them came so near unto him, that he gave
them the bells into their own hands, whereat he wonderfully meruailed, for
that Bartholome Dyas had informed before, that when he was there, they did run
away, and would not be allured to come so near view. The General therefore
finding and perceiving contrary to his expectation, the gentleness of those
black people, he then leapt out on land with his men, making exchange of
certain red night caps with the Negroes for Bracelets of Iuory which they had,
and so for that time departed. The Saturday next after came to the number of
two hundredth black men: and more, some little, some great, bringing with them
twelve Oxen and four sheep, and as our men went on shore, they began to play
upon four Flutes accordingly with four sundry voices, the Music whereof
sounded very well, which the General hearing, commanded the trumpets to
sound, and so they daunced with our men. In this pastime and feasting, and in
buying their Oxen and sheep, that day passed over, and in the self same
sort, upon the Sunday following, ^un^ry of the same, and many more with them as
well men as women, came again bringing with them many Kine, and having sold
one Ox, our men saw certain little Nigroes, which were hidden in certain
bushes, who had with them the weapons of the greater sort of men: wherein our
men coniectured, that some treason was meant to them, and therefore the General
commanded our people to retire to another place, which was of more security,
and those black men went all along the shore directlye against our boats,
until they came to the place where ours disimbarked themselves, and went upon
the land in armor. The Nigroes then joined themselves as though they intended
to fight, which the General perceiving, and not wilyng to do them any harm,
did then retire, imbarking himself, and for to fear them, commanded two
brass pieces of Ordinance to be shot off, whereat they were amazed, The
little Nigroes made more afeard then hurt
and ran away without any order, leaving their weapons behind them. After
this, the Captain general, caused to be carried on the shore, a certain
mark or Pillar, with the King of Portingales Arms, and a Cross, which being
there set and erected, the Nigroes pulled down the same our men yet being
there. These days thus passed over, the Captain general with the rest of the
Fleet departed thence toward the River called, Ryo del infant, upon the
Friday being the eight day of November, which was the Feast day of the
conception of our Lady, and in sailing forward on their voyage, there arose so
great a storm with a forewinde, upon the day of Saint Luke, that our whole
Fleet did run with there small sails, and that also very low. In this
course they lost the company of Nicholas Coello, howbeit the next night after
they all met, and joined together again. Now having past and sailed through
this great storm, or rather torment of wind, which then was ceased, the
Captain General, upon the sixteenth day of December did discover land,
which were certain small Rocks, being distaunt from the Harbor of Saint
Blaze threescore leagues, and five leagues also from the other part of the
Rock called De la cruze, where Bartholome Dyas did erect his last mark: from
which place to the River Del Infant are fifteen leagues. This Country is
very pleasant and sightly in view, and in the same is great store of Cattle,
and the further our Fleet sailed on that Coast, the better and higher the
Trees were, all which things our men might well perceive and discern, by
reason they went so near the shore with their ships. And upon the Saturday
they past hard by, and within sight of the Rock De la cruze, and for that they
were then come so far forward as the River Del infant, they were loath to
pass the same, and thereof taking counsel all the next night, they went
somewhat wide from the Coast, with a forewinde, until Euensong time, and then
the Wind came to the East, which was right against them, wherefore the
Captain general made to Seawarde, going in such sort, as sometime he kept the
Sea, and sometime drove toward the land, until the Tuesday being the
twentieth of December, at the setting of the Sun, the wind then coming to
the West, which was a forewinde, and whether to attain to have knowledge of
the Land they consulted all that night, which were best to do. The next day
at ten of the Clock in the fore noone, they came to the Rock aforesaid,
which is three score leagues a stearne the place, whereunto they minded to go.

This Rock, is the cause of the great Currents that are there, and the self
same day the Fleet through passed the same Course, with a great forewinde,
which had also endured them three or four days, and wherewith they ran
through those Currents, which greatly they feared, They safely passed the
dangerous currents
and were in doubt to have done. These dangerous Currents, thus safelye and
happelye passed without loss or damage, they all were very glad and joyful,
that their good Fortune was to have passed the same in manner as Bartholome
Dyas before that time had accordinglye done. Wherefore the Captain general,
being animated and encouraged with this his great good luck and Fortune, and
after thanks given to God for the same, did then say, that he verelye
believed, that it was Gods good will and pleasure that the Indias should be
found.

How the Captain general came to the Land, called, La terra de la buena
gente, and after went to the River, called, Ryo de las buenas sennales: how he
brought their ships on ground, and of the great sickness our people had
after they arrived there. Chap. 4.
THus following their voyage, they perceived that upon Christmas day, they had
discovered along the Coast, three score and t^nne leagues to the Eastward,
which was the way he carried with him in his Register, and wherein the Indias
are: And here the Fleet went along upon the Sea, without taking land, so
far, that they began to want, and have lack of water for to drink, and were
enforced to dress their meat with salt water, so that no man of that Fleet
had then allowaunce of water to drink, more then one pint a day. Howbeit upon
the Friday being the eleventh day of January, in the year of our Lord God.
1498. drawing near the land, they went out in their boats along the Coast to
take view thereof, and so passing by the same, they saw many Nigroes with a
great company of women, all of them of great stature, which went along the Sea
side, and when the Captain general saw and perceived, that they showed
themselves to be a people, flexible to civility, and of a quiet disposition,
he commanded one of our men called Martin Alonso, who could speak many
languages of the Nigroes, and one other with him, to leap out on Land, and to
go to them, which immediatelye those two persons did: and at their coming to
the same black People, they were of them very well received, and especially
of the chief person or Governor of the same, to whom, our General viewing
his and their manner of courtesy, A revvard sent by ye General to a Nigro.
forthwith sent a Iacket, a pair of Hose, and a Cappe, being all read, and
a Bracelet of Copper, of which things he was very glad, and rendered great
thanks to the General for the same, saying: that with a very good will, he
should have of gift, any thing he would desire or had need off, that was to
be had in his Country. All which, Martin Alonso, understanding their language
told to the General, who was very joyful that by his interpretation, those
people and ours might of each other have understanding, giving also at that
instant license to ye same Alonso and one more of our men to go with those
people for one night to their Town, at the request of the same governor, who
very earnestly required the same. The governor then apparelled himself with
those Garments which the General gave him, and with great pleasure gave
commandment to many of his chief men to go before and receive him when he
came to their town: The people as they went viewed and beheld with great
pleasure and admiration those vestures which our General had given him,
clapping their hands for joy thereof, which manner of gladsome rejoicing, they
used three or four times, before they came to their town: And after their
entrance therein, they went round about the same, to the end all the people
and inhabitants thereof, might see and behold those given garments and strange
arraie: Which being done, the governor entered into his house where he
commanded Alonso and his companion to be well lodged, and gave to them for
their supper a Hen even such as ours be, and Pap made of Mylyo, which is a
kind of grain of a yeolow color, whereof also they make bread: This night
repaired many Nigroes to their lodging to see them: And the next day after the
governor sent them to their ships with certain Nigroes of his laden with
hens, for the Captain General, who rendered thanks for the same, and required
by his interpretour, those Nigroes, to say unto their Governor, that he now
saw and perceived him to be a noble man, or king of that country, and
forasmuch as the General, and the rest of our men in those five days wherein
they had houered upon and viewed that Coast had no manner damage done or
offered them: and saw both many quiet and gentle people there, and also many
noble men, he gave to this land an apt name, calling it, The Land of good
people, in the Town where Martyn Alonso was, their houses be made all of
straw, and very well furnished within: The owmen be more in number, then the
men: for in the company of forty women there are no more but twenty men:
They carry with them long bows with arrows and darts of iron, and upon their
arms and legs they wear many braceleets of Copper, and some pieces of them
in their hairs. Also they carry daggars, the hafts or handles of Pewter, and
the sheathes of Iuorie, so that it is manifest, that they have in that Country
plenty of copper and tin: Moreover they have great store of Salt, which they
make of Salt water, carrieng the same from the Sea side in gourds, and putting
it into certain Caves where they make the Salt: These kind of people were so
glad of the linen that our men carried with them, and brought with them
thither, that they gave for one shirt much Copper. They also were so quiet
amongst our men, that they brought them water to their boats from a river
which was two Crosbowe shot from the place where our men took in the same,
which river they call Ryo de Cobio: From this place our Fleet departed the
fiftenth day of January, A new land discovered of courteous Moors
and going under sail, did discover land of an other country which lies very
low, wherein were trees very high and thick, and so proceeding forward they
discovered or found a river which was very open at the entering of the same:
And for that the General thought it necessary to reknowledge or have notice
of that Country, and there to learn whether they might hear any news or
intelligence of the Indias, he commanded to come to an Ankor, which was upon
the Thursday, being seven days before the end of January, and the same
night he with his brother Nicholas Coello entered the river, and at the dawning
of the day, did well perceive the land to be low and covered with water,
having trees of great height, and thick laden with sundry sorts of fruits:
Our men then beholding the land, which was very pleasant, they saw also
certain boats, at that present coming toward them, with men in the same,
whereof the General was very glad, supposing upon sight of those people and
view of their country, in that manner, which argued they had some knowledge
and experience of the Sea, that therefore they were not far of from the
Indias, or at leastwise could not then go far, but they should hear news of
the same: when the people with their boats came near to our Fleet, our men
perceived they were all black people, of good stature, howbeit all naked,
saving their privy members, which were covered, with little pieces of linen
made of Bomebast or Cotton, they came near and entered into our ships without
any fear, and in such sort used themselves toward our men, as though they
had been of long acquaintance and familiarity with them: They were very well
received of our people of the Fleet, the Captain General commanded the same,
and also that there should be given unto them certain little Bells and other
things, and he talked with them by signs, for they did not understand any of
Martin Alonso his languages, nor any other interpretour yt our men the^ had:
After this their good interteinment they departed, and as it seemed well liking
of the same, they and many others with them afterward returned in their boats
to our ships, bringing unto them such victuals as their country yields: They
in appearance showed themselves very well contented with our men, and as they
came by water, so also did many others of those people repair thither by land,
and amongst them women of indifferent good beauty, especially y^ young maids,
which go after the same sort, that the men do: They have in their lips three
holes, and in every hole a piece of tin, which they esteem as a thing very
gallant and gaye: They took with them certain of our men to make merry at a
country town there near hand, and where they fet water for our ships. And
after the three days space that our General was in that river, Tke courtesy
and apparel of the noble me^ of this Country.
there came of courtesy two noble men of that country to visit him in their
boats, whose apparel was none other, then of the rest, saving the pieces of
lynnen wherewith they covered their members, were far greater, then those the
common sort used, and one of them ware upon his head a tucke or kerchiefe
wrought with silk, and the other had a night cap of green Satin. The
Captain General seeing those men somewhat addicted to cleanliness was very
glad thereof, received them in courteous manner, and commanded to give them
meat, and moreover he gave them apparel and certain other things, but it
appeared by their countinaunces they smallye or nothing at all esteemed
thereof: Howbeit while they remained in our Ships, the General perceived by
tokens and signs which a young man that came with them then showed, that their
country was far of thence, and that they had seen as great ships as ours
were, whereof he greatly reioysed, and all our people in like manner as then
verily hoping and thereby coniecturing, that the Indias were near to that
place: which their hope and conjecture, was also far the more augmented and
confirmed, for that after those noble men were gone to shore, they sent to the
Fleet, certain linen cloth to sell, which was made of Cotton, upon which
also were certain marks of Okar, in respect of which good news, and
intelligence here found, and likely to ensue, the Captain General gave to
this river a name, calling it, The River of the good tokens or marks, and
caused there a mark to be erected, calling the same San Raphael, according
with the name of the ship wherein he was, and went that voyage. And
forasmuch as he perceived by the signs of the young man, that those noble men
inhabited a Country far thence, and that they had seen ships as great as
ours, he thereby and upon other conjectures gathered, that their Country was
near to the Indias, and so consequently that the Indias was far of from that
river where our ships then lay: wherefore consulting hereof, it was by him and
the other Captains then determined upon, that all the ships should be
brought on ground, which determination was executed accordinglye, and the same
ships repaired, dressed, and trimmed in all points needful and necessary: In
doing whereof they spent and passed over two and thirty days, This sickness
is called the Scurfe
in which time our men sustained and passed over great troubles and torments
of mind, by occasion of a sickness there happened amongst them, which was
thought to grow by means of the air of that country, for that the hands and
feet of so many of them, and also their gums in such sort did swell, that
they could not eat, and the same so rotted, that the stink which came out of
their mouths was so great and pestiferous, that none could abide the savor
thereof, with this pestilent infection and sickness our men were greatly
discomfited, and many of them dyed thereof, which also put the rest of the
company in great fear and perplexity of mind: Yea, and further would have
increased and aggrauated their griefs of body and sorrows of mind, were it
not that one De Gama a man of good nature and condition had taken special care
and used great diligence, for the recouerye of their healths, and putting
them in comfort: who continually visited the sick, and liberally departed unto
them such wholesome and medicinable things, as for his own body he had
provided, and carried with him, through whose good counsel given, great pains
taken, and frank distribution of that he had, many of our men were recouerd,
which would otherwise have died, and all the rest thereby were greatly
recomforted.

How the Captain General with all his Fleet, came to the Island of
Monsambicke. Chap. 5.
THe Fleet being furnished and provided of all things necessary, the Captain
General then mindful of his voyage, departed thence, upon the Saturday,
being the 24. day of February, three small Islands discovered not vvorth the
entering.
and the same day, and all the night following, for that he was incalmed and to
avoid the shore, made way into the sea: and upon Sunday by Euensong time, our
men discried three Islands a Seaboord, all of them being but little or small,
they were distant one from another four leagues: Two of them were replenished
with great words, and the third was plain, to arrive to these Islands the
General was not willing, for that he saw or coniectured no cause to occasion
the same, and therefore he still kept the sea, staieng and coming to an ankor
always as the night approached, which manner of course and order he used and
continued the space of six days: And upon the thursday being the first day
of March toward evening, our men came within sight of four Islands, whereof
two were near the shore, and the other two a Seaboord, and for that they would
not that night fall with them, they still kept the Sea, minding to pass
between them, as indeed they did: Whereupon the Captain General determined
and commanded that Nicholas Coello, by reason his ship was less then the
others, should go first, and so going upon the friday within a certain harbor,
which was between ye maine land and one of the Islands, the said Nicholas
missed ye channel, and ran on ground, which danger when our other ships
saw coming after, they did cast then about, and went back, and as they were
returned, they perceived coming out of that Island, seven or eight little
boats under sail, being distant from Nicholas Coello a good league: At sight
of those boats coming toward them, Nicholas Coello and those which were with
him took great pleasure, and for joy gave a great cry, and at their repair
to them Coello and they went to the General and saluted him, to whom the same
Coello said: How say you sir, here is an other kind of people: whereunto the
General answered, that he was very glad of that good Fortune, and therewith
commanded to let them go a Seaboord with their boats, for that his meaning was
to bear with them to that Island from whence they came, and there to come to
an Ankor, of purpose to understand what land that was, and whether amongst
those people, he might hear or have any news or certain intelligence of the
Indias: yet notwithstanding ye generals commandment, they in their boats
followed our ships, always making signs and calling to our men, therein to
stay and tarry for them, wherefore the Captain General, with the other
Captains came to an Ankor, and so they in their boats approached near, and
came to our Fleet: And then by view of their persons it appeared they were men
of a good stature and somewhat black. They were apparelled in linen cloth of
Cotton, welted with sundry colors, some girdeled unto their knees, and others
carried the same upon their shoulders as cloaks, and upon their heads they
wear a certain kind of tucks or kerchiefe somewhat wrought with silk and
gold third. They have swoords and daggers as the Moors do use them, in their
boats they brought with them their instruments called Sagbuts. These men being
thus come to our ships, they forthwith came a board the same with great opinion
of assurance, even as though they had known our men a long time, and
immediatlye began to be conversant, and very familiar with them, using their
speeches which they uttered in the language of Algarauia, and would not be
known they were Moors: The General commanded to give them meat, and they
did both eat and drink with a good will, of whatsoever was given them: And
being asked at commandment of the General by one Fernan Aluares (who could
speak yt language) what land that was, they answered that it apperteined to a
great king which was before, The Island of Monsa^bick, with the town of
Merchandise.
and how that Island was called Mo^sambicke, and the town there full of
Merchantes, which have traficke with the Moors of the Indias, who bring
thither silver, linen cloth, pepper, ginger, silver ringes, many pearls, and
rubie stones, and that out of another Country, which remained behind, they
do bring them gold: Declaring further that if our men would enter into the
Harbor there, they would bring them thither, and they should perceive and see
the truth, and more at large, touching those things they then gave information
of: The General hearing this, entered into counsel with the other Captains,
debating the matter thereof, and argued whether it were good to enter the
Harbor, and see if those things were of truth, which those Moors had imparted
to them, and also there to take some Pilottes to carrye them further, since
they were now destitute of such: Upon which consultation, it was there
determined, that Nicholas Coello should first make an assay and proof for
entrance and sounding of the bar, by reason his ship was the least of the
Fleet: which accordingly he forthwith did. And so going to enter he went and
touched the point of the Island, and therewith brake his helm, howbeit through
God his goodness, he perished not there although he was in great danger and
hasard thereof, for as he went upon the point unawares, so with quick speed
and good fortune he got of the same: Nevertheless he perceived and found y^
the bar was good to enter, and therefore he came to an anchor, two crosbow shot
from the town situated in that Island, which is in fifteen degrees toward y^
South, it has a very good harbor, and also great plenty of the victuals of
that country, the houses of that town be made of straw, and the dwellers
therein are Moors, which trade to Sofala in great ships, Cayro is the caske
orrind of a nut they have in y^ India called Caco, and with the same these
ropes are made
that have no decks nor nails, but are sowed with Cayro, and their sails are
of mats made of the leaf of a palm tree: some of them do carry with them
compasses of Geane by which they do govern, and they be square, they have
also Seacards: with these Moors, the Moors of Indias have traficke, and with
those from the red sea, by reason of the gold they have there.

When they saw our men, they supposed them to be Turks, by reason of the
knowledge they had of the Turks country, through intelligence of the Moors
which dwell in the red sea, they which were first in our ships went and told
their Xeque (for so they call him always that is governor of the town) which
was there for the king of Quiloa, under whose obeisance this Island was.

How the Captain General entered into the harbor of Monsambicke, and how the
governor there, came to visit him at his ships, making peace with him, and
gave him two Pilottes to carry him to Calicut, verily supposing our people to
be Turks. Chap. 6.
THe Xeque or Governor having knowledge of our coming, and that Nicholas
Coello was come to an Anchor in the Harbor, he verelye believed that they were
Turks or Moors of some other place, and therefore forthwith he came and
visited him in his ships, accompanied with many apparelled in silk, whom
Nicholas Coello received with great courtesy: but forasmuch as he nor any of
his ship could speak their language, the Governor tarried not long, howbeit
Coello understood very well, that the Governor deemed them to be Moors, and
therefore he gave him a red Cappe, whereof he made no account, he gave him
also certain black beads, which he carried away in his hands, both which
were given and taken for token of assurance between them: and when he should
depart from our ship, he required by signs of Nicholas Coello to have his boat
to carry him to land, who gladly granted the same, and sent therewith
certain of our men, which the Governor at his return to land, carried with
him to his house, feasting and banketting them with Dates and other things, and
sent by them to Nicholas Coello: a pot of Dates preserved, wherewith he feasted
the Captain General and his brother, after they had entered the Harbor.

The Governor now perceiving the rest of our ships arrived in the Harbor,
Our men taken for Turks, by the Mores of Monsambicke
immediately sent to visit them, believing they were Turks, and presented
them with many pleasant and delicate meats, demanding also license to come
and visit them himself. The Captain general returned for presents to him
again, certain red hats, short gowns, corrall, basins of brass, little
hawks bells, and many other things, all which (as the messenger reported, that
carried the same) he nothing esteemed, asking for what purpose those things
were good, and demanding why the Captain sent him not Scarlet, as the thing
which he chiefly desired. Notwithstanding he came and visited the Captain
General who having knowledge of his coming, commanded the ships to put out
their flagges, and to toll the same. Likewise he ordered, that all our sick
and diseased men, should be hid and not come in sight, and that to his ship
should be sent from the rest of the ships, all those that were not sick,
whom he caused secretly to be put in armor, of purpose to be in a readiness if
the Moors offered any force, or sought to betraye them. The Governor comes
abootd, and the discriptio^ of his person and attire
This preperation made, the Governor came accompanied with many men, all very
well apparelled in silk, bringing with them many trumpets of Iuorie, and also
other instruments, still plaieng upon the same: he was a man of a good stature
and lean, he brought upon him as it were a shirt of linen cloth, which came
down to his heels, and upon the same, the like of velvet of Meca, having upon
his head a cappe of silk of many colors, and trimmed with gold, at his
girdle, he ware a sword and dagger, and upon his feet shoes of silk. The
Captain general received him at the entrance of the ship, carrieng him from
thence, in that part of the ship, where the same was covered over and trimmed
in the best manner it might then be, and many of his people with him, the rest
remaining that came with him in their beats. The Governor thus being received
into the ship, the General desired him to take no offense in that he sent to
him no Scarlet, since in truth he brought none with him: only he declared that
he had in his ships, but such Merchaundise, as he would give and bestow for
victuals, when his men should want the same: and that he went in this order,
only of intent to find out and discover the Indias, by commandment of a great
and mighty King whose servant he was. All which things the General told him
by the mouth of Fernan Martin, who was the Interpretour between them: and then
commanded to give them such banketting meats, and wine as were carried in the
ship, whereof he did both eat and drink very well, and so in like manner
did the other, who came with him, all which were likewise feasted. And as the
Governor remained after this, a very friend to the General, so also did his
people make much, and extend great frindship to our men. He asked of our
General, whether they came from the Turks Country, for that as he had heard
say, the people of the same are white as ours were, requesting also to have a
sight of their Country bows, and of the books of their Laws: Whereunto our
General answered, that he and his Company were not of the Turks Country,
but that they were of a great Kingdom, which confined upon the same, and as
touching their bows and weaponnes, he should with very good will see them:
But as for the Books of their Laws, they had none there with them, for to
carrye the same, were to no purpose, since upon the Sea, they needed not the
use thereof. Then were brought before him certain Crossebowes, which also in
his presence were bent and shot off, whereat he greatly meruayled. They also
produced to sight and view of him certain harnesses or armours, whereat he
also meruailed much.

By occasion of this meeting and feasting, the Captain General had notice and
intellygence, that from thence to Calycut were nine hundred leagues, and that
it was very needful and necessary for him to take a Pilot of this Country,
to conduct him and his Company, by reason they should find many shoells in
their Course thither: and also that along the Coast there are many Cities:
Moreover he understood then, that Presbiter Joan was far from thence within
the Country.

Now since it was so expedient to have a Pilot, the General then requested to
have two such of the Governor, who granted and made promise of the same,
upon condition that our men should well use and content them: Of these Pilots
so promised, our men were glad, for that if one of them should hap to dye,
the other yet might remain and serve their purpose, and for that
consideration, our General required a couple. After this time, the Governor
once more came to visit the General, bringing with him both the Pilottes he had
made promise of, to each of which was given thirty Crowns and a coat, every
Crown worth in money, five shillings, with this condition, and from that day
forward, that when the one of them would go to shore, the other should remain
in ship, for that our men would always have one of them on shipboord, whilst
they remained in Harbor.

How the Governor of Monsambicke, understanding that our Fleet was neither of
the Turks nor yet Moors, would have taken and killed them, and how the
Captain general understood thereof: and what further than followed. Cap. 7.
THese meetings and speeches thus had, for assurance of friendship between
them, and the concourse of them being ended, and the Governor departed, yet
then immediately after appeared, that those Moors having had such company and
long talk with our men had gathered and come to knowledge that they were
Christians, The Moors withdravv there good wills knovving that we were
Chtistians
whereupon all former good will and friendship of the Moors, was now couerted
into wrath and fury, for they practiced means to kill our men, and so to take
the ships. The Governor had thereof consulted and made provision, for
execution of their mischeuous enterprise, which had been likely to have taken
place, and sorted to a sorrowful hap and event, had not the Almighty of his
divine goodness, moved the heart of one of the Moors, which was received for
Pilot to discover the same to the Captain general, who fearing least those
Infidells should sodainlye indaunger him and his, for that they were many in
number, and with him were but a small company, did therefore determine to
remain no longer in that harbor. And so upon the Saturday, being the tenth
day of March, and seven days after his arrival there, he departed thence,
and went with his ships into the Sea, and came to an Ankor hard by an Island
in the same, which was one league from that of Monsambicke, and this was done,
to purpose, that upon Sunday, they would hear Mass on land, confe^^
themselves, and receive the Sacrament, which since (...) coming from Lixborne
they had not done. After our ships were thus at an Anchor, the Captain general
then perceiving the same to be in place of assurance so as the Moors should
not burn them, (whereof before he was greatly afraid) which now by their
remove was prevented and put out of doubt, he then determined to return to
Monsambicke in his boat, to demand the other Pilot that remained on land at
their coming thence: and so leaving his brother with the Fleet in order and
readiness to come and succor him, if he should see him in danger, he
departed toward Monsambicke carrieng with him Nicholas Coello in his boat
and the other Pilot Moore. Going in this sort, they saw how there came bearing
right with his boat, six boats with many armed Moors, having long bows and
arrows, and also shieldes and spears, who when they saw our men, began
then to call unto them, willing them to come to the harbor of their Town. The
Pilot Moore told the General what they meant by their signs and tokens they
made, and gave him counsel to return thither, for that otherwise the
Governor would not deliver the other Pilot which remained on the shore, at
which his speech, the General was very angry, supposing he gave that counsel,
to the end at their coming near the shore, he might escape and run away,
and therefore commanded him to prison, and caused forthwith to shoot at
their boats with their Ordinance, which shot when Paulo de la Gama heard, and
believing it had been some further matter of dangers to the General, then the
cause thereof was indeed, he immediately came forward with the ship called
Berrio under sail, which when the Nigroes perceived, they fied, and made away
with great have, and so fast that the Captain general could not overtake
them, and therefore he returned with his brother to the other ships where they
lay at Ankor. The next day the General, with all his men went on land, heard
Mass, and received the Sacrament very deuoutlye, being the night before
confessed: which being done, they all went aboard their ships, and made sail
the same day. The General perceiving no hope to remain for recovery of the
other Pilot, which was on shore in Monsambicke, gave them commandment to
release him that was in the ship committed to prison, (as before you have
heard, whom they carried with the^ on their voyage. The other Moore Pilot in
revenge practices treason against the fleet
This Pilot minded to be revenged upon y^ General, in stomach of his
imprisonment, determined to carry the^ to y^ Island Quiloa, which was peopled all
with Moors, and as it seemed, meant to inform the King of that place, that
our ships were of the Christians, of purpose thereby to occasion him to kill
and destroy them all: and therefore subtillie to shaddowe his wicked intent, he
willed and persuaded the Captain general, not to trouble himself with the
want of the other Pilot, for that he would carry him to a great Island, which
was from thence one hundredth leagues, and inhabited as it were the one half by
the Moors, and the other by Christians, which always were at wars the one
with the other, from whence also he might furnish himself with Pilots to carry
him to Calycut: But as the Captain general had good liking of those speeches,
so yet gave he no great credit to the man, nevertheless he did promise him
great gifts, if he did carry him to that Country: and so went forward on his
voyage with a small wind. The Tuesdaye after, being within sight of land from
whence he departed, he was incalmed, which did endure Tuesdaye and Wensdaye,
the next night after with an Easterly wind being but small, he made way, and
went into the Sea, and upon Thursday in the morning, found himself and all
the Fleet, four leagues back behind Monsambicke, and so going until the
Evening the same day, came then to an Anchor hard to that Island, where the
Sunday next following he heard Mass. The wind thus being contrary to his
purpose of Navigations, he therefore remained in that place eight days to wait
for such gale thereof as would serve to put him forward on his journey: In
which time repaired to our ships a white Moore which was a Minister of the
Moors of Mons^mbicke, A white Moore repaireth to our ships.
who coming on board the ship of the General, declared that the Governor of
the same Town greatly did repent him of the breach of peace and friendship he
had made with him, and that he would gladly renew the same again and confirm
it, and so remain a friend. To whom the General returned answer by that
messenger to this effect, that he would make no peace with the Governor,
neither would he be his friend, until such time as he did send to him his
Pilot whom he had hired and paid, with this answer, the Minister departed,
and never came again. The Captain general thus staieng still there, and
expecting the wind, there came to him after the Minster was gone, a certain
Moore, who brought his Son with him being a boy, and asked the General
whether he would carrye them in his ships with him to the City of Mylynde,
which he should find in the course he should keep toward Calycut: Declaring
that he would gladly go with him, and return to his Country which was near
to Meca, from whence he came as a Pilot, in a ship to Monsambicke, and
therewith advertised the General, not to tarry upon any answer, from the
Governor, who he was assured would make no peace with him, for that he was a
Christian. The Captain was very glad of the coming of this Moore, for by
him he deemed, to gather sufficient matter of information and intellygence of
the Strayghtes of the Red Sea, and also of the Towns that lie and be
situated along the Coast, by the which he must sail to Mylynde, and therefore
he commanded to receive the same Moore and his Son into his Ship, and by
reason it was then somewhat late, and that they had no store of water, the
General with the other Captains determined to enter into the Harbor of
Monsambicke, to take in there so much as they needed, appointing also there
should be great watch, for prevention of the Moors, least that they should by
any device set on fire the ships. Upon this determination and being prepared
accordingly, they proceeded and entered the harbor on thursday, and when the
night was come, they launched out their boats to go with them for water, for
the Pilot of Monsambicke informed the General, that it was within the firm
land, offering to bring him to the same. Whereupon taking the Pilot with him,
he departed about midnight to go thither, having Nicholas Coello in his
company, and leaving Paulo de la gama in charge of the ships. Being come to the
place where the Pilot informed the water to be, it could not so be found, for
he no doubt, went more to make escape and run away, then to perform what
before he promised, but whether that he was amazed with imagination of escape,
and so could not find it, or that of malice (since he could not run away) he
would not find it, he caused them to spend that night without attaining the
purpose of their repair thither, wherefore the day light appearing, and seeing
they could not find the water, the General would remain no longer, having
but a small company of men with him there, and fearing least the Moors would set
upon him, did therefore determine to go to his ships, of purpose to fetch more
men, and so if need were to fight with his enemies, knowing also he should
far better find the water by day then by night. So having been at his ships,
and there furnished his boats with more force of men and armor, he returned
to shore ward again, carrieng with him the Pilot of Monsambicke, and having
also Nicholas Coello in his company as before to take in water. And when they
drew near to the same, the Pilot seeing that he by no mean or device could
run away, did then forthwith show them the water, which was hard by the
shore side, where also then were in sight the number of twenty Moors
skirmishing with their darts, and showing as though they were appointed there
for the purpose and would defend the water against such as would enterprice to
fetch or take any thereof. The manner whereof when our General saw, he caused
to be shot off, three gunnes to force them to avoid and give place in that
ground, The Moors run away at the crack of the ordinance
so as our men might leap forth of their boats and land without resistance:
The Moors amazed and afrighted with crack and shot of ye Ordinance, ran away
and hid themselves in certain bushes, and so our men quietly landed and took
in fresh water, and a little before ye sun set arrived at their ships, where
they found the company there disquieted in mind, for that a Nigroe of John
Cambrayes, Pilot to Paulo de la Gama, was that day run away to the Moors,
whereof when the General understood, he was very sad and sorrowful for the
same, since he was a Christian: Upon the grief and sorrow hereof he remained
there Fridaie following: Upon the Saturday, being the xxiiii day of March,
and the even of the Annunciation of our Lady, early in the morning appeared
upon the shoore side a Moore right over against the Fleet, who cried out with
alowde and shrill voice, saying, that if our men would have wate, they should
now come for the same thither, where they should find such as would enforce
them to return. The Captain General perceiving how small account they made
of him, remembering also the injury done him in not delivering the Pilot, and
therewith having fresh in memory the loss and running away of the Nigoe, his
Pilots servant, did thereupon grow into some cholar, and so determined to
shoot of the ordinance of his ships, into the town of his enemies, thereby
to be revenged upon the same for the injuries done him, by the inhabitants
thereof, and this his determination, he imparted to his Captains, who having
liking of the same, yielded thereunto, and immediately embarked themselves in
their boats, arming the same with such men as they had, and so coming before
the town, and against the same, there were Moors along the shore, which had
made a pale of boords so thick, that our men could not perceive who was
behind the same. And between that pale or defense and the sea, upon the
shore there was one hundredth Moors, armed with Targets, shields, darts, bows,
arrows, and slings, who so soon as our boats came wtin compass or reatch of
their slings, began to send forth of the same stones at our men, who immediately
answered them again with shot of Ordinance, through means whereof they left
the waters side, retiring within their impaled defense, which was presently
after beaten down with our ordenance, and the enemies running to their town,
left behind them two of their company slain in that place: the defense thus
broken down, and the same all carried away, the Captain General with his men
returned to dinner, in which time it was strange to see how the Moors ran
away by land from that town to another, with y^ fear they had of our men,
and from thence they went by water to another place, which was on the other
side. After dinner our men went with their Captains to see whether they could
take any Moors, verily believing that by taking of some, they should for the
same have restitution of Cambraies Nigro that was run away as you have heard
before: And moreover they thought to recover two Indians which the Pilot Moore
told the General were captives in Monsambicke. In this journey only Paulo de
la Gama did take four Moors in a boat. And although there were other boats
wherein many Moors were, yet could not they be taken, for making have to the
shore, and atteining the same, they ran away, leaving their boats as a pray to
our men, who found in ye same much linen cloth made of cotton, and also books
of their laws of Mahoma, which the General commanded to be safely kept: And
albeit he went that day along and before the town in his boat, as other his
Captains did in like manner in theirs, yet could not they procure any talk
or speech with any of the Moors of the town, and to go on shore he durst
not, for that he had but few men in number with him, wherefore for that time
he departed thence: and the next day returned to shore to take in water,
which without any resistaunce was done. Now being without all hope to
recover the Nigro and the two Indians, the general then determined to depart
without them, howbeit before his departure, he meant to visit the town of
Monsambick, and the dwellers therein, with some sufficient revenge, by sending
to the same such messengers, as thereby they might deem him their mortal
enemy, through the offense they had given him, the town of Monsa^bick battered
from the Fleet
wherefore upon the monday following he went before the town of the Moors
with his Ordinance, and shooting into the same, destroyed it in such sort as
the people thereof were enforced to abandon the same, and fly into an Island
within the country. And so upon the Tewsday being the xxvii. day of March, our
Fleet wayed Ankor and departed from the Town of Monsambicke, and so in going
forward came to an Ankor hard by two little rocks of Saint George, for so they
named it after they came thither, where they remained, for that the wind was
contrary to their purpose: Nevertheless having, after a small wind they
departed, howbeit the same was so small, and the currents there so great that
they were cast backward.

How the Captain General after his departure from Monsambicke, went toward
the city of Quiola, how he lost himself going to the Island of Mombassa, and
how the ship called S. Raphael stroke upon the Flats, the which now have the
same name. Cap. 8.
THe Captain General following his voyage, and being very glad, that they had
found, that one of the four Moors which Paulo de la Gama took in the boat
was a Pilolt, and could carry them to Calicut, upon the Sunday being the first
day of April, came to certain Islands which were very near to the shore, to
the first whereof they gave a name, calling it the Island of the Asotado, The
Island of asotado and why so called
which they so named, for that they there did whippe the Pilot Moore of
Monsambicke, by commandment of the General, as well for that he had told
them those Islands were firm land, as also before that he would not show the
General the water at Monsambick in the night when they fought for the same as
before is declared: and therefore now taking him with the lie, as informed of
those Islands, y^ General was very angry with this Pilot, supposing as it was
likly, that he did carry them thither, of intent the ships should be cast away
amongst the same: The Moore being cruellye whipped confessed y^ indeed he did
carry and train them thither of purpose they should there have perished, and been
cast upon the dangers and rocks of the Islands: These Islands were so many and
so near together situated, that they could hardlye be discerned one from
another, which when the General perceived, he made into the Seaward, and upon
the Fridaye which was the fourth day of April, made his way to the Northwest,
and before the noone tide of the same, had sight of a great land, and of two
Islands near to the same, about which, were many shoe^s: now being come nere
to y^ shore, y^ pilots Moors did recknowledge y^ same, howbeit they said y^
the Island of the christians is that of Quiloa, which was behind or a stern us
3. leagues, wherewith the general was much grieved, believing y^ certainly they
were Christians as the Pilots had informed him, and that they had willingly
lost their course, for that the ships should not arrive at that place. The
Pilottes shaddowing their treason made show of a reasonable excuse, saying,
that as the wind was great, so were the currents swift, by reason whereof the
ships had further made sail then they thought for: But the truth was
indeed, that they more sorrowed their missing and passing by the Island where
they informed to be Christians, then did our Captain General: For they were
verily in hope to have been revenged there, upon our men by death of them all:
But GOD beholding the danger and peril meant toward them, of his divine
goodness and mercy delivered them from the same, and that by a great miracle:
For if our men had gone thither, not one of them had escaped with life, since
the General having such a belief and opinion, that there were Christians in
that Island (as the Pilot had told him) would no doubt have gone presently on
land at his arrival there, and so thereby run headlong into a place where he
and his people should have been put to slaughter: The General thus sorrowing
the miss of that Island, for that he supposed there to have found Christians,
and the Pilots Moors in chafe with themselves for that they had missed their
course thither for purpose before said, it was then on each part determined, to
go back and assaie to find the same: nevertheless although they earnestly
bent themselves to attain unto that desired Island, and spent that day in
travel to win their purpose therein, yet could they not prevail thereto:
For still the wind was so contrary, and the currents so great, as do what
they could, they failed of their wills, and were put off from arrival there,
which no doubt was done by Gods providence, and of his mere favor and
goodness toward our men: as not willing they should receive any danger, or
sustain cruelty, or loss of life, amongst those Infidels, and therefore
miraculously he preserved our people from the effect and sequel of the malice
of those two Pilots of the Moors of Monsambicke, which had imagined in their
minds, and travailed to bring to final and execution their devilish intent:
The Captain general and the other Captains thus tossing up and down, to and
fro, as well with their ships, as also in their minds, determined to bear
toward the Island of Mombassa, Another devise of the Mores to destroy our men
vvithall
in which as those two Pilots gave information, were two Towns, peopled and
inhabited as well with Moors as Christians: (which instructions these Pilots
gave, to the intent to deceive our men, and to train them thither, of purpose
there to kill them, for that in deed that Island was altogether and whollye
inhabited by Moors, as in like manner all that Coaste is,) and therefore
understanding that from thence to Mombassa are seauentie seven leagues, they
made way to go thither, and being then toward Evening, they saw a great
Island situated toward the North, in which the Moors Pilots said there were
two Towns, one of Christians, and the other of Moors, as aforesaid. Thus they
said and invented to the intent to bring our men in opinion, and make them
believe that there were in that Land, and those Coasts many Christians. In this
sort our ships going under sail, certain days, the ship called Saint Raphael
by fortune one morning two hours before day light, came on ground upon
certain shoells, two leagues from the firm land, and as she struck on
ground, they within made signs to the other ships to take heed and beware,
whereupon they shot by the shoells and came to an Ankor, launching out their
boats to give succor to Paulo de la Gama Captain in the Raphael, and
perceiving when they came to the same, that the water did ebb, the General
was marvelous glad thereof, for then he well knew, that at the next flood the
ship would be afloate again, so that now he lost the fear and jealousy he
had conceived, upon the doubt he had that she was lost. Thus recomforted with
the certainty they saw of y^ safety of the ship, they forthwith laid into
the sea many ankers. By this time it was day light, and after that it was a
low water, she then remained dry upon the shore being a Sandy ground, which
was the cause she took no harm, by striking upon the same. Our men placed
their Ankers which were laid forth right over against themselves, and walked
upon the Sands whilst the Ebb endured. So staieng for the flood, and
beholding and viewing that Island, The shoels of S. Raphael.
so far as they could see, they gave for name to those Sands, the Shoells
of Saint Raphael, in respect of the name, the ship there so hazarded did
bear. And to certain great Islands and Hills which were within the firm
Land, directly over against those shoells or sands, they gave the name of The
Hills and Islands of Saint Raphael, upon the same consideration.

The ship thus being dry, our men saw two boats, and Moors of that
Country in the same coming toward them, to see our ships, bringing many
sweet Orenges, far better then those of Portingale, and gave the same to our
men, saying also to the General, that in no wise he should fear any damage
that could ensue to the ship on ground, for that when it were full Sea, she
would then be on floate again, so as at will and pleasure the same might
pass on the intended voyage thereof, with which speeches the General was very
glad not only for the good comfort they gave him, but also in that they came
in so good season and time opportune, and therefore he gave them certain
gifts, which they accepted with many thanks, and certain of them
understanding that our Fleet intended their Course to Mombassa, they desired
the General to carry them with him thither, who granted their requests,
permitted them to abide and remain with him, the others retourning from our
Fleet to their Country. And when it was a full Sea, the ship before on
ground was afloat, and so came off from the Sands, whereupon the Captain
general returned, and proceeded on his way, with all his Fleet.

The description of the Island and City of Mombassa, and how the Captain
general arrived there, and what was the sequel that happened him after he came
thither. Chap. 9.
THe General following this voyage, did upon the Saturday being the seventh
day of April, about the going down of the Sun the same day come to an
Ankor without the Bar of the Island of Mombassa, which is hard by the firm
land, and is very plenty of victuals, that is to say, Millyo, Rice, and
Cattle, as well great as little, but all well grown and fat, chiefly their
sheep, which be all without fayles. Also they have many Hens: Moreover, the
Island is very pleasant, having many Orchards, wherein are planted and are
growing, great store of herbs, and many sorts of fruits: that is to say,
Pomegranets, Figs of the Indias, Ore^ges both sweet and sower, Lymons, and
Cidrons, and in the same are many excellent good waters. In this Island there
is a City, bearing the self same name of the Island, being in four degrees
on the South side, it is a very great City, placed and situated upon an
Hill, which also is a Rock, whereupon the Sea does beat, so that it cannot
be undermined.

At the entering into the Protes or Heaven there is a Mark: and at the
enteraunce upon the Bar, there is planted or builded a little Fort, low and
near to the water. The most part of the houses in this City, are builded
with lyme and stone, with the loftes thereof wrought with fine knottes of
Plaster of Paris, the streets therein are very fair. They have a King of
themselves, and the dwellers or inhabitaunts of the same are Moors, whereof
some be white, and some brown of color, both men and women: it appears
they are good men on horseback. They go gallantly arrayed, especially the
women, which go apparelled in gowns of silk, and be decked and garnished with
Jewels of gold and precious stones. In this City is great trade of all
kinds of Merchandise. There is also a good Harbor, where always are many
ships lieng at Road, and from the firm land comes thither great plenty of
Honnie, Wax and Iuorie, the Captain General thus come to the Bar of this
City, did not then enter forthwith, for that it was almost night when he came
to an Ankor. But he commanded to put forth the flagges, and to toll their
ships, rejoicing and making great mirth, for that their good fortune, and
hope they conceived, that in that Island there dwelled many Christians, and
that the next day they should hear Mass on the shore. Moreover they were
greatly comforted, as having such confidence, that in this place they might and
would cure and heal all such as were then sick amongst them, as in truth
were, almost all that were there present, albeit in number but few, for all
the others were dead. Yet such as remained and had escaped the sickness and
diseases past, and were not dead of the great infirmities and troubles before
in this voyage chanced unto them. Being thus at an Ankor, and the night almost
approached, our men saw about an hundred men in a great Barcke, every one of
them having a Sword and a Target, who at their coming to our ships, would
have entered therein with all their weapons: howbeit the General would not
consent thereto, neither permitted he any more to enter then four of them,
and those also without weapon, declaring to them in their language that they
should pardon him since he was a stranger, Certain of the inhabitants of
this city came aboorde the ship.
and therefore could not tell whom he might trust, and unto those whom he gave
license to enter aboorde his ship, he gave good and gentle entertainment,
banketting the same with such Conserues as they had, (whereof those Moors did
well eat) willing them not to deem evil of him, for his denial of their
enteraunce in manner aforesaid, whereunto they answered, that their coming
then was to see him as a rare and new thing in that their country, and that he
should not marvel to see them bring their weapons, since it was the custom
and use of the same to carry them as well in peace as in the time of war:
also they further declared unto the general, that the king of Mombassa did
understand of his coming, and for that it was so near night, he had not then
sent to visit him, howbeit the next day he would, and that as he was glad of
his arrival there, so also would he be more glad to see him, yea, and to give
him spices to load his ships, furthermore, they informed him that there were
many Christians, which lived by themselves in that Island: whereupon the General
was not only joyful, but also fullye persuaded that their report thereof was
true and unfeigned, since the same was agreeable, and accorded with the
information and talk of the two Pilottes, nevertheless he carried some spark
of jealousy in his head and for all their fair speeches and sugured talk, he
wisely imagined y^ those Moors, came to see whether they might, by any train
take one of our ships, wherein he gessed upon the truth, for certainly their
coming then was only for that purpose, as afterward it was made apparent. For
most true it was y^ the king of Mombassa did know and had perfect intelligence
that we were Christians, and also what we had done in Monsambicke, and
therefore he practiced means to be revenged of us, Svvete practices of sour
treason.
by taking our ships and killing of us, wherefore prosecuting his wicked intent
therein, the next day following, which was Palm sundaie, he sent to our
General certain white Moors, which declared to him y^ their king was very
glad of his coming thither, and that if he would come into his harbor, he
would liberally give him all things he stood in need off, and for assurance
of the same he sent him a ring, a sheep, and many sweet Orenges, Cidrons, and
Sugar canes, giving also these Moors instructions to tell him further, that
they were Christians, and that in the Island were many christened people: All
which they did in such sort counterfai^e, and with so great and deep
dissimulation, that our men thought verily they were Christians: wherefore the
General received them very well, and gave them certain gifts, sending to the
King great thanks for his gentle and liberal offer, saying further, that the
next day he would come nearer in: He sent also to the King a branch of
Coral very fine, and for more assurance to confirm the same, he sent with
those Moors two of our men, which were banished persons, and were carried of
purpose to be adventured in such like respect of danger, or to be left and
put on shore in such places, where it should be thought good to understand
somewhat, and then to return and be taken in again, when our men and the two
Moors were gone: and come to the shore, there met them a multitude of people
to see them, all which went with them and viewed them, even to the kings
Palace, where our men being entered, they passed through three doors before
they came where the king was, at each of which there was a Porter attending,
having every one of them a swoorde in his hand. They found the King but in
small estate, nevertheless he received them very well, and commanded that
in the self same company of the Moors with whom they came, they should be
showed the City, and carried about the same in going and viewing whereof, they
saw in the streets many men Prisoners and in yrons, but because our men
understood not their language, nor they had any understanding of ours, there
was no question demanded by our two messengers, what Prisoners those were,
howbeit they believed the same to be Christians, for that our General was
informed by the two Pilottes, and the Kings messengers, (as you have before
heard) that there were in that Island such Christians, which also had wars
with the Moors.

Moreover they carried our men to the Merchauntes house of the Indias, Merch^ts
of the Indias which are Christians
which were Christians, who having information that ours also were people
Christened, showed themselves to be joyful thereof, both embracing and
banketting them, showing them painted in a Paper, the figure of the holy Ghost,
the which they did worship, and before them made their Prayers upon their
knees, and that with such a counteuaunce, and show of great devotion, as
though they were such men inwardlye indeed, as in appearaunce outwardlye they
then pretented, and made show off: Furthermore, the Moors then told our men
by signs, that many other Christians as those were, did dwell in another
place far from thence, and therefore they would not carry them thither:
howbeit they said, that after our Captain General were come into the Port
or Harbor, they should go and see them. All these things those wily
people, showed and imparted to our men, of purpose to deceive them and to
allure them to come within that Port, where they were determined to destroy
and kill them all.

After they had seen the City, they were then brought to the presence of the
King, who commanded to show them Pepper, Ginger, Cloaues, and Wheat, giving
them of every sort thereof some portion to be carried and showed the
General, and sent him word by his messenger, that of all those commodities he
had great store, and would give him his loading if that he would. Also
that he had Gold, and Silver, Amber, Wax, Iuorye, and other riches, in so
great plenty, that he should have and find there when he would for less
valor and prises, then in any other place.

This Message was brought to our Captain General upon Mundaye, who having
seen the Spices, and hearing of the Kings promise, to furnishe him the same,
and to lade him therewith, was marvelous glad of that offer, and so much the
rather, was he confirmed in opinion of good luck, for that our two banished
men, had gathered such intelligence, and made him so full and good
declaration of the People, City, and Land there, and chiefelye of the two
Christians, they found in the House of the Merchauntes of the Indias.

Wherefore he and his Captains immediately advised themselves thereof, and so
entering into counsel for the same, it was by them thought good, to come within
the port, and to accept the offer of Spices, and afterward to go on their
voyage to Calicut, where if they could not have the like, they would remain
content, with that they should have in this place, and thus having concluded
upon these points, they determined to enter into the harbor the next day:
in this mean while came certain Moors to our ships with so great quietness,
and humility, and with such show and appearance of friendlinesse and love, as
though they had been of long acquaintance and familiarity with our men: The
next day following in the morning, y^ flood being come, the General commanded
to take up their Ankors, minding to enter the harbor, but God not willing that
he and the rest should enter into that present mischief, God sent them
fatherly checks to keep the^ from utter destruction
nor to end their lives in that place (as the Moors had determined they should
have done,) did therefore cause and provide the mean that prevented that
peril, and wrought their safety: For when the Generals ship had wayed her
Ankor, and was going to enter the port, she struck upon a shoel that was
asterne the same, which hap when he perceived, and fearing he should cast
himself away, he then forthwith commanded, to let fall his Ankor, and in like
sort did the other Captains also: which chance when the Moors that were in
the ships saw, and that the General was come to an ankor, they then imagined
that during that day, they should not get the Fleet into the harbor, and
therefore they ran to their boat, which they had on the ships side to go to
the City, at which instant also the Pilots of Monsambicke, falling a stearne
the Admiral, took the water, and those of the boat took them in and carried
them away with them, although the General called unto them, requiring them to
bring back, and deliver them to him again: But when he saw they would not so
do, then he apparantlye perceived that there was an evil meaning in their King
and them, toward him and his, and that it was his great goodness and favor
to give him cause of stay, by happening upon that shoell, thereby to preserve
him from their treason imagined, and put in practice: Thus having declared to
all his company, the opinion he conceived of that which then before their eyes
was done, and appeared to be devised and wrought against them, he then
commanded the night being come, to give some torments or torture, to two of
the Moors, which he brought captives with them from Monsambicke, thereby to
see whether they had practiced any treson, and to enforce them to open and
disclose the same: which commandment being observed, and put in execution, by
heating and dropping of bacon upon their flesh, they immediately confessed,
they had conspired treason, and that the Pilots took the Sea, as fearing the
same had been disclosed: whereupon the General, altogether altered his mind
and purpose of going into that Harbor. Nevertheless being unquiet and greatly
grieved at their falsehood, he was desirous to use like torture to another Moore
captive also: to make trial whether he were of counsel and in consort with
the rest.

But this Moore perceiving preparation made for that purpose, did cast himself
his hands being bound, into the sea, as in like manner another of them did,
before it was day light. The secrecy of the mischief prepared, being thus
come to apparaunt view, and so discovered, the General gave great thanks to
God, by whose only goodness, he and his company were delivered from imminent
death and slaughter amongst those Infidells, and therefore in contemplation and
thanks giving for the same, he and his company being aboard the Admiral,
said the Salve Regina. After this being mindful of their safety, and fearing
least the Moors would attempt some matter against them in the night time, they
therefore ordained strong and diligent watch, commanding every man to watch
armed: And here by the way is to be noted one thing, and that to be meruayled
at, which is this: That when our men came first before the Town of Mombassa,
all such amongst them as then were sick, (which indeed were many) began then
presently to be whole: so that in this time of their great necessity, and
danger, they felt and found themselves sound and strong, which as it was past
all hope and expectation of man, and far above the common course of Nature,
and operation of the same, so the more lively it appeared to be the marvelous
and supernatural work of God, and therefore miraculously done at this instant
time of necessity, when his divine power was to be seen and extended, for the
preservation of that poor distressed number, which then had their only
affiaunce in him. The watch thus prepared and set for that night, it fortuned
that those which watched in the ship Berrio, felt the gabell of the same
wagging, whereat an Ankor lay into the Sea, and at the first they adjudged that
the gabell had been wagged or shaken by a kind of Fish called a Tunnie whereof
many were there about which be very great and good meat, Tunnie good meat and
plentiful in the coast of Mo^bassa.
but giving better and more attentive ear thereto, they then perceived that
their enemies were at the same, who in truth did swim about the gabell, and
were cutting of it with their woodkniues or fawchings, and hoping or rather
verily knowing, that perfourming their enterprise thereof the ship would
run a shore, and so both she and our men in the same be cast away and taken:
For by any other devise they could not accomplish their wills, and therefore
they practiced this mean. Howbeit our men having discryed whereabout they
were, prevented them, by crieng out and calling to the other ships, showing
what was in doing, and willing them also to beware and look to the same,
whereupon they of the ship Raphael, came presentlye to their succor and
rescew, finding some of their enemies amongst the cheines of the tacklings of
their formast, who perceiving how they were discovered, suddenly cast
themselves under water, and with the others that were cutting the gabell of the
ship Berrio, fled away swimming to certain boats, which they had lyeng
somewhat far off, wherein (as our men afterward understood) were many
Moors, who taking them in, rowed fast away, and so returned to the City.
The Wensday and Thursday following, our Fleet still remained there, about
which in y^ night time came the enemies in boats, which always lay hard by
the shore, from which some of them did swim of purpose to epsy, if by any
mean they could cut a sunder the gabells of the Ankors, but our men observed
and kept such diligent and wary watch, that they could not prevail,
nevertheless our men were greatly troubled, and put in fear of burning their
ships. For truly it was to be meruayled at, that the Moors came not about
the same in such ships as they had, which if they had done, it had been then
lykely by all conjecture of man, that they should have destroyed and killed us
all. It was coniectured that they being in fear of the Ordinance in our
ships, durst not give attempt to set upon the same by force, but whatsouer
cause appeared in our sightes to be a let in that respect to them: It was
most certain in deed, that it was God his good will and favor, to put their
hearts in fear to deal with us in any forceable manner, whereby we might be
preserved from the cruelty intended toward us.

Herein is contained matter of the City of Mylinde, and how the Captain
general came thither. Chap. 10.
THe Captain general did willingly tarry and remain before Mombassa, the
two days as before is declared, of purpose to see if he could have from thence
two Pilots to carry him to Calicut, for that without them it was very hard for
him to go thither, since our Pilots had no knowledge of that Country. But
when he saw he could not have any there, he departed thence upon Friday in
the morning with a small wind, and at the coming over the Bar, he left
behind him one of his Ankors, for his men were so wearied with bringing and
hailing up the rest, that they could not way up the same, which afterward
being found there by the Mores, was carried to the City, and placed hard by
the Kings Pallaice, and remained there at what time Don Franco de Almeyda was
the first Lord President of the Indias: who when he took the same town from
the Moors, found this Ankor there, as I shall declare in the second Book of
this present Treatise. Being thus departed from Mom. bassa and passing on their
voyage, eight leagues beyond the same, the General and his Fleet, through
lack of wind, came to an Ankor hard by the land in the night, and in the
dawning of the day, they discovered two Sambucos (which are little Pinnacies)
under the lie, three leagues from the Fleet a Sea board, which when the
General saw, and being desirous to have some Pilots to carry him to Calycut,
he supposed he might be sped of such to serve his turn, if he could take those
small boats or Pinnacies, and therefore waying his Ankors, he and the other
Captains went toward them, and pursued the same until Euensong time, at which
instant the General took one of them, but the other ran alande, from whence
before it came. In this Pinnace which was so taken, were seauenteene Moors,
amongst which was one old Moore, who seemed to be Master of the rest, having
with him a young woman that was his wife: Among the Mores also old men use to
marry young women.
In the same also was found great store of silver and gold, and some
victualles. The Captain not stayeng upon this occasion, forthwith went
forward, and in the self same day with his whole Fleet came hard by
Mylynde, which is eighteen leagues from Mombassa, and in three degrees to the
Southwarde it has no good Harbor, for that it is almost an open Road, but
there is a certain Piere or recife whereon the sea does beat, which is the cause
why the ships do ride far from y^ shore: This City stands in a broad field
along the Sea side, and round about the same are many Palm trees, with many
other sorts of trees, which all the year grow green: Also many Gardens and
Orchards, The beautiful situation of Mylynde, with the pleasantnes of the
soil, and fruits.
replenished with all kind of herbs and fruits, and very fair fountains of
good waters in the same: But principally their Orenges excel, which are not
only very great, but also very sweet and pleasant in taste: They have also
great store and plenty of victuals, as Mylyo and Rise, Cattle both great and
small, also great store of Hens, which be very fat and good cheap. The
City is great, having in the same fair streets, and many fair houses of lime
and stone, builded with many lofts, with their windows and tarrisis made of
Lime and earth: The natural people of that Country are black, and of good
proportion of body, with curled hair, the strangers which resort thither and
make their abode there, are Moors of Arabia which do govern themselves very
well and commendably, especially the Gentlemen, who from the girdle upward go
naked, and from the same downward do cover themselves with silk, and with
very fine cotton cloth, and others with short Cloakes made of Cotton after the
old fashion, the which they do wear to cover their arms pits: and upon their
heads, they wear a certain manner of Cloth wrought with silk and gold. They
wear also rich Daggers with great tassels of silk, of many colors, and
swoords very well garnished: They be all left handed, and carry with them
always bows and arrows, for they use the pastime of shooting, and be great
good Archers. Moreover, they account themselves to be good horsemen, although
there be a common saying or speech used by the inhabitants in the coasts
thereaboutes: The men on horseback of Mombassa: and the women of Mylynde: for
as in Mombassa be very good horsemen, so in Mylynde are very fair women, which
go richly apparelled: In this City also dwell many Gentiles of the kingdom of
Cambaya, which is in the Indias: and those are great merchants using tract or
traficke for gold, whereof there is some in that Country, as in like manner
there is Amber grease, Iuory, Pitch, and Wax, all which they give in exchange
to such as come from Cambaya for Copper, Quicksiluer, and Cloth of Cotton, and
that the one and the other has gains thereof: The king of this City is a
Moore, and is served with far greater estate then the other kings which
remain behind* Mylynde like a city of Portingale
The General being come over against this City did rejoice in his heart very
much, and so likewise did all the rest of the Fleet, for that they now saw, a
City like unto those of Portingale, and therefore they rendered most hearty
and humble thanks to God, for their good and safe arrival there: And being
desirous to have some Pilottes to carry them to Calicut, the General
commanded to come to an Ankor, minding to assay if he could by any means
obtain such there as might serve for that purpose: For until this time, he
could not know of the Moors he had taken, whether amongst them were any
Pilots, who albeit they were offered torments, still answered and said, there
were none of them skillful in that respect.

How the Captain General sent a Moore in message to Mylynde, and what
answer the King made him. Cap. 11.
THE next day after being Easter even, the old Moore which was taken Captive,
with the rest in the Pinnace, told the General that in Mylynde were four
ships of the Christian Indias, promising also that if he would license him, and
the other Moors to go to land, he would give him for his resgat, Christian
Pilots, and moreover would furnish him with all things he had need off. The
General being well pleased with the speeches, and offer of this old Moore,
commanded to wey their Ankors, and so removed and came to an Ankor within in
half a league of the City. But from thence there came no body to our Fleet,
for they feared and were in doubt that our men would take them captive, and
besides they knew by the Pinnace which the General took, that we were
Christians, believing also that our Ships were Ships of war: All which
the General supposing they coniectured: he therefore upon the Mundaye in the
morning commanded the old Moore to a certain shelfe lyeng over against the
City, and there to leave him, from whence he deemed they would fetch him, as
indeed they did, for when our Boat was gone from thence, there came from the
shore a boat for the Moore, and so carried him away presently to the King, to
whom the Moore declared on the behalf of the General what he requested to
have, and further that he desired to be at peace with him, in respect of his
noble personage, whereof he had heard great good report, hoping also that it
was God his great good will and pleasure that the Indias should be discovered,
which the rather by his aid and furtherance might be accomplished. The king
hearing and receiving in favorable part the message, and messenger, was also
very glad thereof, and forthwith returned the Moore in a Boat, sending
with him one of his own servants, and a Priest by whom he sent the
Captain General word, that he was very willing to conclude a peace between
them, and that he would give him such Pilottes, A present sent to ye Captain
General from the king of Mylynde
as he would desire, with whatsoever besides he had need of, and by these
messengers were presented to the General, from the King three Sheep, many
Orenges, and Sugar Canes, which he received in thankful wise, and by the self
same messenger, returned answer to the king their Master, that he granted
unto, and accepted of the peace moved and offered between them, and was and
would be ready to confirm the same. Moreover he said unto them, that the
next day, he would enter into their Harbor, and that the King should
understand that he came from, and is subject to a great King, upon the
Cape of the Occident, who was desirous to know where the City of Calicut
stood, and had sent him to find out and discover the same, commanding him
also, to make peace with all kings and Princes, upon whose territories in his
way, he should hap to come and arrive, which would be willing to have the same
with him: and further told them that it was now two years since he came from
his Country, and that the king his Master was such a worthy and puissaunt
Prince, as the king their Master would be glad to know him for his friend:
Thus having talked and discoursed with them to effect aforesaid, he then
dismissing them, sending by the same for a Present a Hat, (which in that time
was used) and two branches of Coral, three basins of Brass, certain little
Bells, and two Scarffes to the king. The next day after, being the second
after Easter day, the Captain General came near to the City, whereof the
king having knowledge, did immediately send to visit him, in more honorable
sort: for hearing how far of he was come, and what he sought, he adjudged
the king of Portingale to be a Prince of a great stomach, and the General to
be a worthy subject in obeyeng to hazard himself, in so dangerous and long a
journey Also he conceived great pleasure in his heart that he should see
such people, as had so long time travailed upon the sea, and so desirous to see
our men, he sent word to the General, that the next day following, he would in
his own person visit him, and that their meeting should be upon the water, and
therewith sent him six sheep, and store of Cloves, Ginger, Pepper, and
Nutmegs. This message thus declared, the Captain General yielded to the kings
determination, and thereupon did enter nearer, and came to an Ankor, hard to
the four ships of the Indias, (whereof the old Moore told him before.) The
Owners then having knowledge that our ships came from a Christian Country,
and that we were Christians, did immediately come to visit our General, who at
that instant was in the ship of Paulo de la Gama: These men are brown of
color, but they are of good stature and well proportioned: The description of
their persons and attire that inhabit this country and City.
They go apparelled in long white gowns made of cotton, they have great
beards, and the hair of their heads is long like unto women's, and pleited
under their toockes, which they wear on their heads. The General at their
repair to him, received them very well, asking them first whether they were
Christians, by an Interpretour he had that could speak the Algarauia tongue,
whereof they had some understanding, saying that it was not their proper
language, howbeit they yet had some knowledge thereof, by occasion of the trade
and talk they usually have with ye Moors, of whom they advised him to beware,
and not have over far trust and confidence in those of Mylynde, least that
the sequel of their inward meaning, were far contrary to their outward
show. The General determining of himself to make trial, whether they were
Christians or not, or had any knowledge of God, commanded to bring forth a
Table, wherein was painted the picture of our Lady at what time she wept, in
which also were the pictures of some of the Apostles, and showed the same to
the Indians, not telling them what it was: which they saw, they fell presently
down upon the ground, worshipping that Representation, and prayed a while,
whereof our General was very joyful, and then demanded whether they were of
the City of Calycut, whereunto they answered, No: howbeit they said they were
of another City, further off called Grangalor, but of Calicut they could not
say or inform any thing. And from this time, so long as our Fleet remained
there, they daily came to the ship of Paulo de la gama, to make their prayers
before that Table, and did offer to the Images in the same, Pepper, and other
things. These Indians did eat no Beef, as we were informed of them.

How the King of Mylynde visited the Captain general, and made peace with
him, giving him a Pilot to carry him to Calycut. Cap. 12.
THe last day of the eight after Easter, dinner being done, the King of Mylynde
came in a great boat hard to our Fleet, apparelled in a Cassocke of Crimson
Damask, lined with green satin, having upon his head a rich towell. He was
sitting in a chair, such as was used in old time, very well made and wrought
with wire, being in sight very fair, and in the same was a cushion of silk,
and another like unto that hard by him, which was covered with a hat of Crimson
satin. There stood hard by him as his Page, an old man, who carried a very
rich sword, the scabered whereof was silver: he brought with him many Shagbuts,
and two Flutes of Iuorie, which were eight spans of length each of them, they
were very well wrought, and upon the same they played by a little hole that is
in the midst thereof, agreeing and according well with the shagbuts. There came
with the King, about the number of twenty Moors Gentlemen all richly
apparelled. The King now being come near to the ships, the Captain general
came forth to meet him in his boat well trimmed and set out with all his
flagges, and he himself comely araied, withal his best apparel, carrieng
with him twelve of the most principal men of his ships, his brother only
except, whom he left with charge of ye same. The boats of each part being come
near together, The meeting of the king of Mylind and the Captain general.
and the one making countenance of friendly salutation and entertainment to the
other, the King then said to the General, that he would speak with him in his
own boat, of purpose to see and view him the better, whereupon forthwith he
received him into his boat, the King then giving to the General as great
honor and courtesy as though he had also ben a King: he very earnestly noted
and beheld him and his men, as a strange sight and matter to him and his
people: he required the General to tell him the name of his King, and being
told, he commanded the same to be then presently written: he also inquired
matter perticularly of him, and of his power, whereunto the General answered,
and in every point satisfied his demand, declaring also for what cause ye
king his master had sent him to discover Calicut, which was to have from thence
spices, whereof in his dominion and country was none. And after he had thus
talked with the King and informed him somewhat of the same and of the straights
of ye red Sea, the King then promised to him a Pilot to carry him to Calicut,
and also very earnestly desired him to go with him into his City, there to
take his pleasure, and solace himself in his Pallaice, saying it was needful
and necessary, after so many troubles, in so long a voyage sustained, to use
some recreation, and take some rest: further then promising, that if he would
so do, that afterward he in like manner would go with him to see his ships, and
make merry in the same, whereunto the General answered, that he had no license
of the King his Master to go a shore, and therefore if he should vary from his
Princes will and commandment therein, he should then give an evil account of
himself, to which excuse the King replied, saying, that if he should go to see
his ships, what account should he then make to those of his City, or what
might they deem and adiudge of him therein: yet notwithstanding he said, yt it
was a grief to him yt he refused to go with him to his City, which was and
should be at ye commandment of him and of ye king his master, to whom he would
send his Ambassador or else write, if he would come yt way at his return from
Calicut. The General yielding thanks to the King, promised him to return y^
way, and whilst they were thus talking there, did send for those Moors, which
he had taken captives, and gave them to the King, saying that if he could do
him any further pleasure, he would gladly do the same: with which gift the
King was so content, that he said, he did more esteem of the same, then if he
had given him such another City as that of Mylynde was. Now having ended their
talk and confirmed the friendship between them, the King then rowing amongst
our ships, and beheld the same, with great pleasure and admiration* out of
which great store of shot of Ordinance passed, wherewith they were greatly
delyghted, all which time our General went with him, to whom he declared, that
he never saw any men of whom he took so great pleasure, as he did of those of
Portingall, whereof he would gladye have some with him, to help him in his
wars, which he has sometime with his enemies: for it well appeared they were
men apt to offend their enemy, and to abide and suffer any travel or pain,
that should happen unto them. To which his speeches the General answered,
that if he had experience of their doings, he would then a great deal better
like of them, and further that they would help him, if the King his Master
would send his ships of war to Calicut, as he doubted not but he would, if
it were Gods good pleasure to permit the same to be discovered. After the King
had in this sort solaced himself, he then desired the General, that since he
would not go with him to his City, he should then let him have two of his men
to go and see his Pallaice, and for pledge of the same, he would give him his
son, and one of his chief Chaplains, the which they call Cacis, whereunto
the General yielded and appointed two of our men to go with the King, who at
his departure, requested the General that the next day he would go along in
his boat hard by the shore, where he should see his horsemen running, and so
they departed for that time, the next day being Thursday, the Captain general
and Nicholas Coello, went in their boats armed along the shore, the one
somewhat distant from the other, between whom upon the shore were many men on
horseback skirmishing, and as our boats approached near the shore, there came
certain footmen down certain stayres of stone from the Kings house, which
was in sight, where they took the King up in a chair, and carried him very
near to the Boat of the General, to whom he spoke very loving words, and
once more requested him to enter upon land, and go to his City, for that his
father being a lame man, was desirous to see him, and that whilst he should
remain on shore, The General would not consent to go on la^d at Mylynde
both he and his children would enter and abide in his ships. But our General,
fearing least under such sugared speech some bitter bait might lie covered, did
therefore still excuse himself for going on land, alleging he must obey his
Prince, who gave him no license or commission so to do at any time. And so
taking his leave of the king, he went a while hard by the ships of the Indias,
shooting off much Ordinance, who when they saw us pass by lifted up their
hands, saying: Christ, Christ, and that night with the kings license our men
made them a great feast, with much pastime also of Squibs, Gunne shot, and
great and loud cries. The Fleet thus lyeng in ye harbor, there came upon ye
sundaie being the. 21. day of April, from the king, a man that was in great
credit with him, to visit the Captain General, who at that instant was very
sad and heavy: for that it was then two days since any man came to the Fleet
from the City, by reason whereof he feared least that the king were offended
with him, as taking occasion of offense, for that he refused to go on shore,
supposing also that he would therevppon, break the peace and league made
between them, for which he was sorrowful, especially since as yet he had no
Pilots. And when he saw, that he which was so great with the king, did bring
him no Pilots, he then began to have some jealousy, and suspicion of the king,
who being informed thereof, and knowing the General remained there for that
cause, did therefore forthwith send him a Pilot, a Gentile (called in their
language Gosarate) whose name was Canaca, making excuse that he had not sent
him sooner, and so the king and the General remained friends, and continued
the peace before concluded upon between them.

How the Captain General departed from Mylynde, came to Calicut, and of what
greatness and nobleness that city is. Cap. 13.
THE Captain General being thus provided of all things necessary for his
voyage, departed from Mylynde toward Calicut upon the Tewsday, being the 22.
day of April, and from thence he began to cut over a goulfe, which is of
seven hundredth and fifty leagues, for the land there does make a certain
great valley, which does run along the coast from the North to the South, and
our voyage in demanding of Calicut, lay to the Eastward, in following whereof
the next Sunday our men saw the North, which a long time before they had not
seen, and also they saw the South, of which good fortune they thanked God, in
that it represented as then to them winter of the Indias, and where always in
that goulfe are great storms, they now found none, but rather fair weather:
The Fridaye being the.xvii. day of May, and xxiii. days next after their
departing from Mylynde (in which time they had seen no land) they then
discovered and came to sight of land. They were 23. days, and savve no la^d
after their departure from Mylinde.
And the Fleet being viii. leagues of seaboord from the shore: the land
seemed high: their Pilot whose name was Canaca, did as then let fall the
Plommet, and found forty five fathom, whereupon to avoid and apart himself
from that coast, he made his way to the Southeast, and upon the Saturday he
made to landward, howbeit he ran not so near the same as he might certainly
know it, but he perceived by small showers of rain, which fell as they made
toward land, y^ they were on the coast of ye Indias, for y^ at y^ present time
of ye year, y^ winter is ever in those Indias. The sunday, being ye xx. day of
May the Pilot saw certain high hills, which were over the City of Calicut,
and came so near to land, that he did reknowledge the same, and with great joy
and pleasure, demanded of the General Albrycias, saying that this was the
land, which he and his company so greatly desired to see, and come to. The
General replenished with joy of that good fortune* gave Canaca his demand, and
forthwith went to prayer, saying the Salve, wherein they gave God great
thanks, for this their happy and safe arrival upon that coast, and in sight
of the place, which they so earnestly longed for to see, when prayer was done
they made great joy, and feasted on shipboord, and the self same day in the
evening, the General came to an Ankor two leagues from Calicut, The Fleet
arriueth at Calicut and the manner of the people there
and immediately came certain people of that land in four boats called
Almaydyas, to our Fleet, to understand what ships these were, having never
before seen any of that making, come to that cost: These people came all
naked, saving that their members were covered, with little pieces of linen
cloth: they are brown people. At their coming to us some of them entered
into the Generals ship, and albeit the Pilot Goserate, told him that they
were Fishermen, a poor kind of people (for so they call all such as be poor
men in the Indias) yet he received them all well, and commanded his men to
buy of their Fish, which they brought with them: And having some talk with
them, he did understand that, that town was not Calicut, for it was they said
further off, and offered to carry our Fleet thither: Whereupon the General
required them so to do, and therewith departed thence, and were brought by
those Fishermen to Calicut, which is a City situated on the Coast of Malabar,
which is a Province of the second Indias, that has his beginning in the Mount
Dely, and ends at the end of Comory, which is in lentgh threescore leagues
and one, and fifteen in breadth: All the Country lies low, and is apt to be
covered with water: There be many Islands in the same, and it does enter into
the Sea Indico: There is a very high hill which divides the limits between
them, and a great kingdom called Narsinga: The Indians do report that this
land of Malabar in old time was maine Sea, and ran as far as ye hill where now
the Islands of Maldiua are, which were then firm land, and did cover and
discover ye other of Malabar, in which are many and pleasant Cities, and those
also very rich, by reason of ye trade they have principaly with the^ of
Calicut, which in riches and vice does excel al in our time, whose foundation
was on this sort: This Province of Malabar was in the old time governed
altogether by one king, who made his aboade in the City of Conlan, and in the
last kings days of this land (whose name was Saranaperimal, and died six
hundredth years agone) the Moors of Meca discovered the Indias, and came to
the Province of Malabar, the inhabitaunts whereof then were Gentiles, and the
king himself was a Gentile: From the time of the coming of these Moors, they
began to account, the years as we account, from ye birth of our Lord God:
And after they came thither, they grew into such familyaritie with this king,
and he entered into such conference and good opinion of their laws, that he
renounced the manner of religion of his own Country, and minded thence forth
to embrace theirs, and the love and liking he had of this sect of Mahomet so
deeply took root, and entered into his heart, that he determined to go and
end his life, in the house of Meca: Thus being resolved, for the love he bare
to that sect, to abandon and leave his kingdom for ever, and go with them,
before his departure he imparted to his kindred, The first and strange
institution of the kingdom of Calicut.
and divided amongst them all his Lordships, and territories, and having
distributed and given the same so far forth, that there remained to him no
more but xii. leagues of his Country, which lay near to the shore, where he
meant to imbarke himself, the which was never before inhabited, and therefore
he then gave ye same to a cousin of his, which then served him as his Page:
commanding y^ the same circuit should be inhabited in perpetual memory, of
his imbarking there: To the same his kinsman he also gave, his sword, and a
towell after the Morisco sort, as things apperteining and incident to the
estate, and gave commandment to all the Gentlemen to whom he had given all
the rest of his lands, that they should be obedient and true subjects unto him,
and to take him for their Emperor, (the kings of Conlan and Canamor only
except) whom also he commanded and charged, and likewise all the others, that
they nor no other Lords should coin money in the Province of Malabar, but
only the King of Calycut. So having thus bestowed and given his lands,
possessions and dignities, as he thought good, and set every necessary thing in
order, for establishing his determinate will and pleasure, he then embarked
himself there, where now Calicut is builded and situated, and for that the
King did there imbarke himself to go toward ye house of Meca, ye Moors then
took such devotion toward that place, that they and all their posterity ever
since that time hitherto would not, nor yet will take any lading but out of
that Port. And from that time afterward, they came no more to the Port of
Coulan, as usually they did before, by mean and occasion whereof, the same
grew to ruin, and was destroyed, especially when Calicut was once builded, and
that many Moors came and inhabited the same. For as they were Merchaunts of
great dealings, so came they thither, and made there the greatest and richest
Fair or Mart of all the Indias, finding there all the Spices, Drugs, Nutmegs,
and all other things that could be wished, as all kinds of precious stones,
pearls, and seed of pearl, Laker is a kind of gum that proceeds of the Ant.
Musk, Saunders, Aguila, fine Dishes of earth, Laker, gylted Coffers, and all
the fine things of the Chyna, Gold, Amber, Wax, Iuorie, fine and course
cotton, as well white as dyed in colors, much raw silk, and silk twisted,
and all kind of linen cloth of silk, and gold, and cloth of gold, and
cloth of tissew, chamlets, grain, scarlets, carpets of silk, Copper,
Quicksiluer, Vermilion, Allome, coralls, Rose waters, and all kind of
Conserues, so that there is no kind of Merchandise of all the world, which
could be demanded, but it should be found there. Moreover, it was very quiet,
for that it was situated along the Coast, the which lies almost open, and
very dangerous: it is environed and set round about with many Orchards, in
which are many sorts of fruits of that land, and many herbs, and excellent
waters. Also they have many Palm trees, and other sorts of trees. In this
land there is but small store of Rice, which is there a principal victual, as
amongst us our Wheat is, but there comes from other places great abundance
thereof, as in like manner there does of other victuals. The City is great,
and all the houses be of straw, (only the houses of their Idols, Chapels,
and the Kings houses except) which are of lyme and stone, and covered with
tyle, for none but they are permitted by their laws to have any other manner
of building then with straw. It was inhabited by Gentiles of sundry sects, and
by Moors which were great Merchaunts, and so rich, that some of them had
fifty ships. There is no such season of Winter, but that there may lie in that
Harbor six hundred ships. They have there a shore whether they do carry them
with small travail, for that they be made without nails, sowed with ropes of
Cayro, and pitched upon, they have no quiell, but are flat bottomed.

Of what great power the King of Calicut is, and of his use and custom:
likewise of the other Kings of Malabar, and how the Nayres do live. Chapter. 14.
FOr that this City was of so great a trade, and also the Country round
about, so inhabited, which increased so largelye the Kings rents, it came to
pass, that he grew to be so rich of money, and so mighty in power by
multitude of people, that in one day he was able to leauie and make in a
readiness thirty thousand fighting men, and in three days space, one hundred
thousand. They called him Samoryn, which in their tongue is Emperor, for so he
was among the Kings of Malabar, and there were no more but two beside him: that
is to say the King of Coulan and the King of Canauor: For albeit the others
were called Kings, yet were they not so.

This King of Calycut was a Bramene, The election and suce^isio^ of the kings
of Calicut.
as others his Predecessors also were, which amongst the Malabars are Priests,
and for that it is a custom and ancient order observed, that all the Kings
do dye in one Pagode, which is the house of prayers to their Idols, he is
elected for that cause, for always in the same house there must be and is, a
King to serve those Idolles, and when he that serves there does dye, then
must the King that then raygneth and governs, leave his Empire, and go serve
in that place as the other did, and into his place and Kingdom, they elect and
put an other, that shall so succeed him.

And if any of them that is in possession of the Kingdom, refuse to go into
the Pagode, (the King that then serves in the same being dead) they will then
enforce him thereto which so refuses, although it be against his will. These
Kings of Malabar be brown men, and go naked from the gyrdell upward, and
from thence downewarde, they be covered with cloth of silk and of Cotton:
sometime they put upon them short gowns, which they do call Basus of silk
or cloth of gold, and of scarlet with very rich stones: and especially the
King of Calycut excels in those attires and Jewels. They be shaven, leaving
upon the upper lip as the Turks use, the hair vnshauen. They be served but
with small estate, especially at their meat, whereof they have but little:
But the King of Calycut is served, with greater Estate.

These Kings do not marry, nor observe the Law of marriage, the kings Lemman
with her state and allovva^ce
but yet they may have a Lemman of the house of the Nayres, which amongst the
Malabars are Gentlemen, and she has her house by her self, near to the
Pallaice. They do allow her so lyberallye for her charges and maintenance,
that she may have plentifullye of all things to her contentation, upon that
Stypende assigned her.

And when any disliking is had of her by them, they may always leave her and
such children as they have by her, be not taken or accounted for theyrs,
neither do they inherit the Kingdom, nor any thing of theyrs.

After they be men, they are had in no more estimation, then that is incident
unto them from the mothers blood and parentage. Their brothers do inherit if
they have any, if not, then their sisters children shall, who do not marry,
neither yet have any certainty of their husbands. They be very free and at
liberty, to choose those of whom they like, and be such as are best esteemed
of. They have very great rents allowed them: and when any of them come to the
age of ten years, (for at that time they are to be known of men) their kindred
then do send forth out of this kingdom, for a young man Nayre, and
presenting him with gifts, earnestly request the same to take her virginity,
who then receives her with great joy, and after she is thus used, does tie
about her neck a Jewel, which she does carry and wear always during her
life, as a thing in great estimation, and for a token of the liberty given her
by that act, to do with her body afterward for ever, what she will: for
without this manner of ceremony, they may not know any man. These Kings
sometimes have wars one with another, and they in their own persons go into
the fields, yea, and if need so require, they also fight: when they die, they
be carried out from their pallaice into a plain field, where they be burned with
great quantity of wood of sanders and a sweet wood called Aguila. At this
burning are always present all his brothers, and nearest kindred, and all the
noble men of the country. And they make stay of him from burning after his
death three days, that they all may repair thither and come together, to see
and view whether he came to his death naturallye, or whether he were killed:
for if he dyed by force of any man's hand, then are they bound to take
revenge thereof.

After he is burned, and all the ashes buried, they do all shave themselves
without leaving any hair, yea, even of the least child that is a Gentile. All
of them in general do then cease from eating of Betele, during the space of
thirteen days, and he that does eat the same infringeth their law, and
therefore they will cut his lips, and that by justice: In all this time, the
prince which shall succeed does not command nor govern, which is done of
purpose, to see whether in that time any man will come to say or object any
thing against him. These things and days, thus done and past, the noble men of
the Country do cause him to be sworn, to all those laws and customs, which
were made by his predecessor, and to pay all his debts: Also that he shall
travail to recover whatsoever things of his kingdom before were lost: This
oath he takes having his swoorde in his left hand, and in the right hand a
Candle burning, which has a ring of gold upon it, which he touches with two
of his fingers, and so takes his oath. This being done, they throw or power
upon him a few grains of Rice, with many such other ceremonies, in doing
whereof they say many prayers, and he worshippeth then the Sun, three times,
which so done, the Caymayles, that be Lords by parentage do immediately holding
the self same Candle, swear to be true subjects unto him.

The thirteen days being ended, they all then do eat Betele again, and
flesh and fish as before, the king only except, who then takes thought and
sorroweth for the death of his predecessor: whose manner of mourning is thus:
He must not by the space of one whole year, eat any flesh or fish, or yet
Betele, neither must he shave his beard, nor cut his nails, nor eat but once
in a day, and must wash himself all his body over, before he do eat, and
pray certain hours in the day: After the year is past and ended, he then
uses a certain ceremony for the soul of the king his predecessor, which is
much like to our Dirge, whereat are assembled an hundredth thousand persons, at
which time he gives great alms, when this ceremony is finished, they then
confirm the Prince for inheritour of the kingdom, and so all the people do
depart. The king of Calicut and all the other kings of Malabar, have one
especial man that has the charge for administration of justice, and does
command and is obeyed in all other matters of government as amply as the king
himself. Naires, and what their degree, office, and calling is.
The men of war which the king of Calicut and the other kings have, are
Nayres, which be all Gentlemen, and are appointed to no other office or
affairs, but to fight when need requires. They be all Gentiles, and carry
their armor wherewith they fight themselves, which is bows, arrows, spears,
daggers made like a hook, and targets, and march with them very honorably and
gallantly, but they go naked, carrieng only certain linen cloth of cotton
painted, with the which they cover themselves from the girdle to the knee, they
are bare footed: and wear upon their heads certain towels. They all live by
the king, and by the noblemen of the country, of whom they have ordinary
stipends and allowaunce for their maintenance: They do so greatly esteem and
make account of their gentry, and of their cleanliness, that they will not
touch any husbandman, neither permit any of them to come into their houses. The
husbandmen are bound when they go in the streets to cry with a loud voice,
and say, Hoo they go, for if these Gentlemen do come, and bid them go out
of the way, and they do not obey their commandment therein: then may they
kill them: The king cannot make Gentlemen, except they be of the stock of
Gentlemen. They serve very well and faithfully, with them of whom they have
their interteinment, and under whose obeysaunce they live, not sparing by night
nor day, any opportunity of time for show of their best endeavor in
service of the same, nor making any account of meat or of their person or of
sleep, whenever their travel or diligence, may take effect or purpose of
well doing. They have so small charge and occasion of expense, that with half
a crown a piece (which is their ordinary allowance for one month) they may
very well and sufficiently, maintain themselves, and each of them a boy to
serve him. The Nayres by the law of the country, cannot marry, and for that
cause they have no children certain, but those which they have are begotten of
Lemmans, with which three or four of them do lie, by accord and agreement had
and determined amongst themselves, having one woman only to serve that
purpose, unless any cause or quarrel grow amongst them, and every one of
them shall be with her a whole day, accompting from the one half of the day
present wherein he comes, to the other half of the day next following, at
which time he departs from hers, and then comes another, who continues the
like time: Thus they pass over and spend their life time without care and
trouble of wife and children: They maintain their lemmans very well according
to their degrees and birth. And if any of them will at any time leave and
forsake her, they may at their pleasure do it, and likewise she may refuse
any of them at her will. These women are all Gentlewomen, for the Nayres amye
not take any Country women, and they also do not marry: And for that there
be so many men to one women, they take not them for their children which be
begotten of her, although the same be like unto them: and therefore their
brothers children, do inherit their lands, and have their goods: This law
that these Gentlemen should not marry, the king ordained and made, for that
they having no wives nor children, on whom they should have care and fix their
love, might the better endure the wars, and live at more liberty to serve in
the same.

And because they are Gentlemen, and that they should be the more animated and
encouraged to live in that order, The Calicutia^s kill no kine for they
worship them.
and to serve well, they be so privileged, that none of them can be imprisoned
for any cause, nor be put to death by any mean of ordinary justice: Howbeit
when one of them does* kill another, or else does kill a Cow, (which amongst
them is taken for a great sin, for that they worship them) or sleep or
eat with a country woman, or speak evil of the king. Then will the king,
having true information of any of these offenses, give out his warrant in
writing under his own hand, directed to one Nayre, commanding him thereby,
that he with two or three other, do forthwith kill the Nayre, that has so
offended and sinned contrary to the Law: By virtue of which warrant, they hew
and cut him with their swoords, wheresoever they do find him, and when he is
dead, they hang upon him the kings writing, to the end that all men may know
and understand wherefore they killed him: These Nayres cannot take their
weapons, nor enter into any combat, before they be armed knights: when they
atteine to the age of seven years, they be forthwith set to learn to play
at all weapons; and to the end they should be very perfect, their Masters
do hale and wrest the joints of their arms, and afterward they teach them
their fence such as be apt for the same: The weaponnes that are most used
amongst them be Swoords and Targets. The Masters which teach them, be
graduats in the weapons which they teach, and they be called in their language
Panycaes. They be reverenced amongst the Nayres, and every scholar of theirs
whatsoever, although he be old, or if he be a great noble man, shall at all
times when he sees him, do to him reverence and worship, and this by law is
ordained: and further all of them are bound to take at their hands a lesson two
months in every year, during their lives: By reason whereof they be very
perfect and skilful in their weapons, and for that cause they greatly esteem
of themselves.

When any of them will be an armed knight, he then goes well accompanied with
all his kindred and friends, and presents himself before the king, to whom
he first offers threescore Fannons of gold, which is a certain kind of
money amounting to the value of three crowns. Whereupon the king does
immediately ask him, whether he will keep and observe the order and custom of
the Nayres? Whereunto he answers and says, yea. Then he commands to put
about him a swoorde, and laieng his right hand upon his head, says certain
words as though he would pray over him, which he utters so (...) as none can
hear the same. Afterward he imbraceth him, saying in his language these words
following, which in our tongue, does signify or mean: Have a regard to keep
these Bra^^^es and their Kine. This being done, the Nayre does fall down and
worship the King, and from thence forth he remains made Knight. These Nayres
when they yield themselves to live and serve any King or Noble man, they bind
themselves to dye with him, and for him: which bond they do so well observe
and inuiolably keep, that if their Master in any war or otherwise be slain,
they will fight until they are killed, which has done the same act, and if
at that instant they cannot accomplish their wills, for that they were not
present at the deed doing, then will they go afterward and seek them out,
and never leave them till they be killed by some manner of devise. They be
great southsayers, they have good days and bad days, they worship the Sun,
the Moon, the fire, and the Kine, and the first that they do meet in going
forth of their house in the morning: they do easily believe whatsoever
vanity. The Devil is oftentimes in them, their god or the devil is many
times in them.
but they say it is one of their Gods or Pagodes, for so they call him: but
whosoever or whatsoever it be, it inforceth them to utter terrible words and
speeches, which the King does believe. And the Nayre in whom the Devil is so
entered, goes with a naked sword before the King, altogether quaking and
trembling, giving himself cuts and wounds saying, I am such a God, and I am
come to tell thee such a thing, and in this manner he uses himself, crieng
out like a mad man: and if the King make any doubt of that he says and does
not presently give credit to his speech, then does he rore and send forth
greater cries and give himself greater cuts, until such time the King do
believe him. There be other linages of people of ye Malabars, which are of
diverse sects and customs, whereof to speak were over tedious, and too long to
declare: all which do obaye those Kings, (the Moors only except) which by
reason of the great customs they pay for their Merchandise, are in great
estimation among them.

How the Captain general sent one of his banished men to Calycut, and how a
Moore of Tunis came and spoke with him, by whose means he sent a messenger to
the King of Calycut, and how he returned answer to the General. cap. 15.
THe Captain general being come to an Ankor without the Bar or Recife of
Calycut, he sent one of his banished men in the self same Almaydes or boats
which they brought thither, for two respects: the one to see what Country it
was: the other to make trial how we should be received, because we were
Christians, believing also y^ the people there were christened: and when this
banished man was landed, there came immediately a great number of people to see
him as a stranger: they asked of the Malabars which went with him, what he was?
Who answered, that they deemed him to be a Moore, and that he came with those
which are in the three ships they do see without the Bar at Ankor. Whereof
they of Calycut greatly meruailed, for that his apparel was far different
from that which the Moors y^ come from y^ straights, do use to wear. Thus
flocked about him much people, and some that had the Algarauia tongue, spoke
unto him, but he having no understanding thereof could not nor did make any
answer or speeches unto them, at which also they in like manner greatly
meruailed, for that being a Moore (as they deemed) he did not understand the
Algarauia language: Nevertheless going with him in this manner, and verelye
yet believing he was a Moore, they carried him to the house of two Moors,
Bontaybo a More of Barbary, dwelling in Calicut
which were naturally borne in Tunys in Barbary, and were then come to dwell
in Calicut. To whom being brought, one of them whose name was Bontaybo could
speak the Spanish tongue, and did well know the Portingals as he said
afterward, having seen them in Tunys in the time of ye King Don Joan in the
ship called Lareyna which the same King sent thither many times to seek for
such things as he and his subjects had need of. And as soon as the banished
man was entered into their house, the Moore spoke unto him and said: I give
thee to the Devil, who brought thee hither, which words was uttered in ye
Spanish tongue. And after he asked him what way he had gone and travailed, that
he was come to this place: whereunto the banished man answered and told him,
showing also, how many ships the General had there, whereat Bontaybo meruailed,
and wondered how they could come by Sea thither. Then he asked him what they
sought so far off? And he answered that they came to seek Christians and
spices. Moreover Bontaibo asked why ye Kings of France and Spain, and the
Duke of Venice did not also send thither? Whereto the banished man made
answer, that^ ye King of Portingale would not give his consent they should so
do: Bontaybo replieng thereto, said, that he did well and wisely therein.
Thus having talked a while, he gave him very good entertainment, and commanded
to give him certain Cakes, made of the flower of Wheat, which the Malabars do
call Apes, and with the same honnie. After be had well eaten, Bontaybo advised
him to go to the ships, and said he would go with him, (as indeed he did) to
see ye Captain general. And being come to the Admiral which was then
entered, Bontaybo then began to say to the General in Spanish: Good luck, good
luck, many Rubies, many Emeraulds: thou art bound to give great thanks to
God, for that he has brought thee where there is all kind and sorts of
spices, stones, and all the riches of the world.

When they heard him so say, they all meruayled greatly thereat, for they
before would not have believed, that there had been any man so far off
from Portingale, that could understand their language.

Wherefore with weeping tears which they then plentifully shed for joy and
pleasure they had conceived, as well for the same, as also for their safe and
happy arrival there, they then gave to God most humble and hearty thanks
through whose only favor, good will, and pleasure, that good luck and great
good benefit, had happened to them. And then the General embraced Bontaybo,
and caused him to sit down by him, asking him if he were a Christian, and how
he came to Calicut? For answer whereto y^ Moore told him of whence he was,
and what he was, and how he came to Calicut by the way of Cayro, also he showed
him by what means he came to knowledge of Portingals, and that always he had
been a friend to them, for that in all respects and at all times, their doings
and manners appeared to him to be good and worthy of friendship. Finally he
said, that as he had in time past been a friend to them, so would he now at
this present continue his good will, and was ready and would be to do all that
in him was to pleasure and further them, and the effect of their purpose in
coming thither. The Captain general gave him great thanks, and promised to
recompense him very liberally in respect of that his good will, and for any
pleasure or friendship he should thenceforth show to him and his company, he
should be well assured to be thankfully considered of. Declaring also that he was
the most joyful man of all the world to find him there, and to have him for a
friend and an aid, verily believing that God had sent him thither, to give an
end to the enterprise of the voyage, which he so desired in discovering of
those Indias, and had entered into, and passed through so many dangers by long
tract of time to attain unto the same, and now notwithstanding his arriual
there, he thought to have but small fruit of his travail, without his help
and friendly furtheraunce.

Then he requested him to declare, what manner of man the King of Calycut was,
and whether he thought he would receive him with good will as an Ambassador
from the King of Portingale.

(...) Bontaybo answered, that the King of Calycut, was a very good man and of
an honorable disposition, The king of Calicuts greatest revenue rises by
custo^e of Merchandise.
and that he no doubt would receive him gladly, for Ambassador, from a
strange king, especially if his coming were to settle and entreat for
establishment of tract or trade of merchaundise in Calicut, and had brought
with him any kind of Merchaundise for that purpose: For (said Bontaibo) as
there does grow great advantage and profit by custom thereof to the king, so
is the same indeed the very principal rents or revenues he has for his
mainteynaunce: Moreover he informed the General that the king at that instant
was in a certain village five leagues from Calicut, situated along the coast,
named Panane, whether he advised him to send unto him, and to declare of his
arrival and coming thither. The General very well liking of the speeches and
advise of Bontaybo, did therefore give unto him certain gifts, and sent with
him two of his men in message to the king of Calicut, Certain messe^gers sent
by ye Captain general to ye king of Calicut
requesting Bontaybo to direct them on their way to Panane, which he
accordingly did. These messengers being now come before the king, one of them
whose name was Fernan Martyn, by an interpretour which he had, declared unto
him, that he came from his Captain who is arrived in the port of Calicut with
certain ships, and is come thither from the king of Portingale, of purpose
to bring him letters, which the same Captain is ready to come and present
unto him, if it so stood with his good liking and pleasure, whereof to
understand he then had sent him, and his fellow there present. The king
hearing this message, commanded before he would make answer thereto, to give
to each of them a certain piece of lynnen cloth made of Cotton, and two of
silk whith were very good, and even such wherewith he was accustomed to girdle
himself: And after these pieces were so given them, he then demanded of Fernan
Martyn, what king that was which had sent him those letters, and how far
from thence his kingdom was, whereunto Fernan answered and fully informed him
touching that demand, declaring also that he was a Christian prince, and that
all those whom he had sent were christians, having past many troubles and
dangers upon the sea, before their arrival there at Calicut. The king hearing
all the discourse of their voyage (whereof Fernan Martynes somewhat at large
informed him) did greatly marvel at the same, and showed himself to be right
glad, y^ a Prince of so great a power as the king of Portingale was, and being
also a christian, would send an Ambassador to him: And therefore he sent word
to the General that he and his company were hartelye welcome into his
Country, requiring him to bring his ships to an ankor near, to a village
named Padarane (which is somewhat beneath the place where they first came to an
ankor) being a far better harbor then that of Calicut, which is an open road
and very dangerous for the ships: And appointed that from thence, the General
should go by land to Calicut, where he would be to speak with him: And therwt he
sent a Pilot, who conuaied the ships to the port of the same village, howbeit
when he had conducted them to the bar thereof, the General would not enter so
far within the same, as y^ Pilot would gladly have had him to have done,
fearing indeed that some thing might afterward happen to his prejudice, if he
should give over far credit to those people, and came within the compass of
any their forces, wherein he dealt very advisedly and wisely, prevented such
injury as was offered him.

How the king of Calicut sent for the Captain General and after what sort he
was carried to Calicut. Cap. 16.
THe Captain being come near to this harbor, his dispatch was sent him from
y^ Catuall of Calicut, in ye which there was signified y^ he was come to
Pandarane, by the kings commandment, with other noble men, for to bear him
company unto Calicut, and therefore he might at all times when y^ it should
please him, disimbarke himself: But for y^ the day was past y^ Captain General
excused himself as at y^ present, and also y^ he would first take counsel of
his Captains, and other the principal of his Fleet, touching his landing, who
being all joined together, said unto them, y^ he minded to go to see y^ king of
Calicut, and to settle there a trade, and perpetual friendship. Against the
which his going, his brother repugned, alleging y^ it was not convenient y^
he should so do. For albeit y^ they were christians, Moors mortal enemies to
christians*
yet y^ there were amongst them many Moors, which were to be feared least thy
would procure his destruction, since that they were his mortal enemies. For
when that they do remember how those of Monsambicke and Mombassa, for only
passing by their ports, would have killed them all: What should they look for,
of those of Calicut, knowing that they will mixture themselves with you and
yours: quoth he, you seeking to have the trade where they have the same, and so
to diminish this their profit and gain? He told him therefore that it is the
sooner to be believed, that they would procure with all their force possible to
destroy him, yea, although they knew that the beginning and end of the same did
depend upon his death, and that therefore there would not lack ways to put
the same device in execution, who being once dead, for all the grief the king
should take therewith, yet he could not raise him again to life. And that so
much the more they being as it were natural inhabitauntes there, and he a
mere stranger.

Moreover who does know what the king does pass for his death, and what shall
become of them all after the same is procured. Princes and Generals ought to
be eareful of their persons in respect of their place and charge.
And if so be that they should be cast away altogether, then were all their
travail lost. To excuse all this, and that they might remain upon this good
assurance, it were very good said he, that he did not go a shore, but that
he did send one of them, or some other, who might do that which he should
do, for those that are Captains in especially Generals should not
adventure themselves in such dangers, but where there were such great
necessity, that they could not otherwise excuse themselves. Of this mind
were all the rest of the company, unto whom the Captain General answered,
that although he knew or did understand yt by his coming it were present death
unto him, yet he would not let but go and visit the King of Calicut, and the
rather to see whether he would settle a friendship and trade there, and to have
out of his City, Spices and other commodities, for that the same (at our
arrival in Portingale) might represent as a witness the discovery of
Calicut. For if so be that at the end of so long a time God did return us
thither without: then said he, it would be hard to be believed that we had
discovered Calicut: And our credit and honor would stand in suspense or
balance, until such time there should come persons of credit from thence,
that should declare that to be true which we had affirmed. Therefore do you
not think but yt I had rather die then suffer so long time, as we have spent,
and are like to spend, and others shall come to discover ye truth of our
service: so that in the mean while, those that are envious, should judge our
travail as it should please them, certainly I had rather die then to tarry
upon the same: Much more friends I do not adventure my self to so great a
danger of death as you do surmise, neither yet that they should remain in so
great danger, as you do presuppose, for I go to a Country where there are
Christians and to talk with a king, which is desirous that unto his City
should come many Merchants, for the profit that does arise thereby unto him:
for the more Merchants that do resort unto it, the more will be his profit. I
do not go thither to stay there many days that the Moors shall have any
such time to use any treason against me. And for so much as I do mind to
talk with the king it shall have an end, and that within three days* and in
this time you may be in a readiness: And as touching the honor and credit
that I shall get by making or establishing this trade, if it please God that he
do accept the same I will not give it for any treasure. And the king can
settle the same with no other better then with me, for that he will esteem me,
and bear some reverence toward me, being once known unto him that I am the
Captain general of this Fleet, and the King of Portingales Ambassador,
rather then with any other person whatsoever. Furthermore whosoever he be that
shall go in my steed, the King will think himself to be mocked, or that I do
not esteem him, as one that is worthy that I should go to speak with him,
or else that I do not trust him on his word. Besides all this, I cannot give so
large instructions to him that I should send thither, that he might do in all
things which is needful as much as I my self: and if so be that for my sins
he should kill me, or take me as a prisoner, it were a great deal better for
me that there should chance to me all this for doing of my duty, then to
remain alive, and not to do the same. And you my friends remaining in the
Sea and in good ships, The General determined to go to Calicut
as soon as you shall hear that any of these things shall chance unto me, get
you hence, and carry news of this our discovery, and as touching this, let
there be no farther talk, for that I by the grace of God will go to Calicut
to see the King. When that his determination was perceived, they all assented
that they were contented with his going: and thereupon they appointed him
twelve of his men to go with him, that is to say, Diego Dias his Secretary
and Fernan Martines the interpretour, John de Sala, which was afterward
Treasurer of the house of the Indias. etc. So that with him in all they were
thirteen. They appointed also that in his absence there should remain for
Captain general his brother. Also he gave commandment that he should not
suffer any man to come aboard his ship, and all those that were desirous to go
aboard to command them to remain in their boat or Almadias. Moreover he left
order with Nicholas Coello, that he should come every day with his boat as
near unto ye shore as he could. These things being settled, the next day after
being Mundaye, the xxviij. of May, the Captain general did imbark himself
with those twelve before rehearsed, they all being apparailed in the best
attire that they had, and their boats furnished with much ordinance, flagges,
and trumpets, which went always sounding, until such time yt ye Captain
general came to land, whereas ye Catual was tarrieng for him, being accompanied
with 200 Nayres, which attended there continually: besides many others y^ were not
of that company, and besides many also, yt were of yt town. The Captain
general being disimbarked, The Captain General goes a la^d.
was joyfully received of yr Catuall, and of ye others yt did accompany him, as
though they were very glad of his coming, and after yt he was thus received,
he was taken into an Andor, which y^ King of Calicut had sent to bring him
upon, for yt in this country they are not accustomed to go a horseback, but
in these Andors, which are like unto a horslitter, saving yt they are without any
cover over them, and almost plain, ye sides thereof are also very low. Each of
these Andors, when they will occupy ye same, are carried with 4. men upon their
sholders, which also does run post with the^, at such time as ye king and noble
men do make any great iourny, or if so be yt they will go a great ground in a
small time: for they may travel in ye same either sitting or lieng, as they
will themselves. Also there go with these certain footmen, which carry with them
hats, wherewith to cover those y^ go in these Andors, which they do call Bueys,
so that by this means, they are kept from y^ sun and the rain, there are
also other Andors, y^ which have over the^ a cane bowed like unto a hoope,
which for y^ they are made very slight, may easily carry those 2. men. The
Captain general being mounted in this Andor, departed with the Catuall, who was
carried in another Andor, to a town called Capocate, but all ye rest of the
company went afoote, the people of the country was commanded by the Catuall to
carry all such apparel as our me^ had brought up with the^, which was there
redeliuered unto the^, and being in Capocate, they staid to refresh themselves:
where the Captain general being in one house and the Catuall in another they
did eat, the fruits of Calicut
and to al our men was given to eat sodden fish, with rice and butter, besides
fruits of ye country, which differ from ours very much, yet they are very
good. The one sort of these is called Lacas, and the other Mangas, howbeit they
have figs also. The water yt they did drink, was very excellent, as good as
any in Portingal. Thus after they had eaten, they went again to imbark
themselves, for that they should go up a river, which from thence runs into
the sea: the Captain general did imbarke himself with his company into 2.
Almadias, lieng the one close to the other, which in y^ country they did call
Ensangada. The Catuall with his train were embarked in many others, and the
people that came to the rivers side to see and view our men were without
number, for so much as that country is well inhabited. And after that they had
gone in this river about a league, and that along the shores side, they saw
lieng a ground many great ships, the Captain general with the Catuall being
disimbarked, did return to their Andors, and following their way, there
resorted always about them thousands of people to see them, wherein they
took such a felicity that the very women also with their children hanging at
their backs, did not feel the way they went in, following to feed their
eyes. From this place which I have made mention of, the Catuall did carry him
unto a certain Pagode of their Idols, into which when they were entered, he
told him that the same was a Church of great devotion, which the Captain
general believed to be true, and to be some church of the Christians, and
therefore he gave the more credit thereunto, the rather for that he saw yt over
the principal door thereof, there hanged seven little bells, and before the same
there was a pillour made of wier, the which was as high as the mast of a ship,
upon the top thereof there stood a wether cock, made likewise of wier. This
church was as great as a good Monestary, and was made all of free stone, and
covered or vauted over with brick, which gave an outward show, as though
within side it should be of very fair workmanshippe. Our Captain was very
glad to see the same, for that he thought himself to be among Christians, and
entering within this Church with the Catuall, they were received by certain
men, naked from the girdle upward, and from thence down to the knee, covered
with certain linen cloth made of cotton, with y^ which their arm holes were
covered also, without any thing upon their heads, and upon their left sholders
they had certain number of thrids, which came under their right shoulders,
much like as the Priests were wont to wear their stoles here amongst us, when
they went to Mass. These men are called Cafres and are Gentiles, which serve
in Malabar in their Pagodes, who with a sprinkle took water out of a certain
fountain and threw the same upon the Captain general and upon the Catuall
and on the rest of the company. Holy water of Calicut
After all this they gave them Saunders in powder to cast the same upon their
heads as they did here their Ashes, Holy ashes.
and as also they should do ye like upon ye brawns of their arms, but they
could not do so, by reason of their apparel which they had on, but yet they
did not let to do it on their heads: so going about this Church, they saw many
Images painted upon y^ wall, whereof some there were y^ had great teeth, which
appeared to be so monstrous yt they were of an inch of length without their
mouth. Others there were yt had four arms, and therewith were so ill favored,
that they seemed to be very devils, yt which sight made our men stand in
doubt, whether the same were a Church of Christians or no. Being come before the
Chapel which stood in ye midst of their Church, they perceived yt the same had
a certain little roof, made much after ye manner of a tower, y^ which was also
builded of free stone, and in a part of this roof there was a door made of
wire, by y^ which a man might enter into it: the going up to the same tower,
was by a staire of stone: within this tower, which indeed was somewhat dark,
was enclosed in yt wall a certain Image y^ which our men beheld a far off, for
yt they would not suffer the^ to go near y^ same, The General decerued,
commits Idolatry with the Devil.
saying yt there was none y^ could go thither, but those y^ were Cafres, howbeit
they made a sign to the Image, naming y^ same our Lady, giving thereby to
understand that it was her Image. The Captain general supposing the same to be
true, fell upon his knees, with y^ rest of y^ company making their prayers: but
one whose name was John de Sala, being in doubt whether ye same church were of
christians or not, for y^ he saw so monstrous Images painted on y^ walls, as he
fell on his knees said, If this be ye devil, I worship god. The Captain
General that heard him say so, looking upon him laughing. The Catuall and his
company as they came before this Chapel, did fall down flat upon the
ground with their hands before them, and this they did three times, and
afterward they arose and made their prayers standing.

How and after what sort the Captain General was received in Calicut, and how
he told the king his message which he carried. Cap. 17.
FRom this place he went forward on his way, until such time he came to
Calicut, and at the entering of the same, they carried him with the rest of his
company to another Pagode, like unto that which he had seen before, and when
that he would have entered into the City, the people were so many, as well of
those that came forth of the same for to see our men, as also of those that
went with him, that for the multitude of them, he could not go in the streets,
insomuch that the General meruailed to see so many people: and when as he
saw himself to be there, he gave God great thanks, for bringing him unto
that City, most humbly desiring him, so to guide him, that he might return to
Portingale, with his whole request and desire. After that he had gone awhile in
that street, into which he entered, for that the people were so many that he
could not pass through it, insomuch that those that did carry him upon his
Andor, were driven to go with the Catuall into a house. Thither came to bear
the Captain General company, the Catualls brother who was a noble man, and
sent by the kings commandment to accompany him to the kings pallaice, who
also brought with him many Nayers, and before them went many Trumpets and
Sagbuts, upon the which they went all sounding. And also there was one Nayre
which carried a Caleeuer which he shot of, now and then. After yt the Captain
general and this noble man was thus joyfully received, they took their way
straight to ye pallaice, with a great noise, y^ which those instruments and the
people together made, which after yt the Catuals brother was come, gave place
and followed after them, with as great obedience as if ye king had been there in
his own person. There went along with the^ fully three thousand men with their
wepons, besides those yt stood upon ye penthouses, and at their doors, which were
without number. The Captain general was very glad to see how well he was
received, and said unto those yt he carried with him, with a merry countenance, how
little do they think in Portingale of this our great receiving, and with this
they came to ye kings palace an hour before ye Sun set. The kings palace
(leaving aside yt the same was made of earth) was very great, The description
of the kings pallaice,
which seemed to be of a goodly building, for ye great multitude of trees which
did appear between ye houses, and these were standing in goodly garde^s, in ye
which were plesa^t flowrs, sweet herbs, and fou^tains of water to recreate ye
king wtall, for yt he never goes from this palace til yt he departs from
Calicut. Out of this palace there came sundry Caimales, and other noble men to
receive ye captain general, which brought him to a certain great court yt was
right before ye gates, and from thence they went into 4. other several yards or
courts. At ye gate of each of which, there were.x. porters, which gates they
passed with giving ye people many and sundry blows, which ye porters bestowed
upon the^ to make room, yt we might go in: and being come to ye last gate
which was in ye house where the king himself was, there came forth an old little
man, which was Bramene Mayor of ye kings house, who embraced the captain
general, and carried him in with those yt were with him. Bramene Mayor is the kings
high Priest, and the chiefest of the religious me^ of his gentility. At this
entering the people wonderfully pressed themselves to go in, for that they see
the king but by great chance, as going but few times abroad out of his
palace, and would therefore have entered with our me^ to see him. The multitude
was so great yt there were some of the^ stifled, as also there had been two of our
me^ so used, if so be y^ they had not gone before, and it had smally profited
to lay on y^ people with their staves to y^ end to make more room, if so be there
had not ben many of the^ hurt, wherwt they gave place y^ our me^ might enter.
Moreover those noble me^ which did accompany the Captain general, at this
third gate entered into the house where the king was, the which was very great:
all the same was compassed about with seats made of timber, The description of y^
kings presence chamber.
one above y^ other as the Theaters are: the floor of the same was al covered
over with green velvet, and the hangings about the walls were of silk of sundry
colors. The king himself was of color brown, and of a great stature and of
good years, he was lieng upon his Estrado y^ which was covered over with a cloth
of white s^lke and gold and a rich estate over him, Estrado is a seat made of
boords. On his head he had a night cap, made much like unto a salet, after y^
old sort which was covered over with stone and pearl, and in his ears he ware
jewels of y^ same sort. He had upon him a iacket of fine cotton, ye buttons
whereof were of great pearl, and the butten holes were of gold thread, he had
about his middle a white cloth made of y^ forsaid cotte^, y^ which reched down
unto his knees, y^ fingers of his hands and toes were full of rings of gold, in
ye which were set very fine stone, and on his arms and legs many bracelets of
gold: hard to this Estrado, there was a certain yewer y^ which had a high foot
wrought al of gold, and is of y^ making of ye Flanders cups, and that plain,
albeit they are greater and not so deep: the kings Vitele.
in this was ye Vitele which the king does chaw in his mouth, with salt and
Areca, which is an apple no bigger the^ a nut in Conserua. This is eaten in all
ye Indias, for y^ the same does make a good breath, dries y^ stomach and
kills y^ thirst, which being chawed in pieces he throws y^ same out of his
mouth, and takes another. And for yt the king should not swallow y^ same down,
there is prepared a vessel of gold for him to spit in, which is as big or little
bigger the^ a dish, having a foot also of gold. Also he has a fountain of
gold which is full of water wherwt he washes his mouth, when he had made an
end of chawing this Vitele which he is accustomed to take.

This Vitele is ministered unto him by an old man which stands hard by the
Estrado, all the others that are in this place hold their left hands before
their mouths, to the end their breath should not come where the king is, who
takes the same for great discurtesie, to spit or to s^niese, and therefore
there is none that breaths before the king. The Captain General being come
into this house, made reverence to the king, after the use of the Country,
which is to stoop or bow down three times, lifting up his hands as one that
praises God. The king immediately made signs unto him as willing him to draw
near unto him, and commanded him to sit down in one of those seats which I
have spoken of, who being thus set, the rest of his men did enter and made him
the like reverence, whom the king commanded likewise to sit down right over
against him, and that there should be given them water for their hands, that
they might with the same refresh themselves since they were very hot, for
although it was winter yet it was hot. After yt they had washed their hands, he
commanded to be given them Figs and Iacas to eat, and that forthwith, which
they did receive with a good will. The king was very glad to see them eat, who
was very earnest in looking upon them, and did laugh thereat. Afterward he
took occasion to talk with the old man that ministered unto him this Vitele,
The custom in drinking.
and in the mean time our men did call for water, for that they were a thirst,
the which was given them to drink by an Yewer of gold, and when our men did
understand ye order of their drinking was to hold their cup of height over
their mouths, for y^ the Malabars do take the same for an injury to touch ye
cup with their lips, they did therefore hold the same over their mouth, in that
order that part of the water fell into their throats and made some of them to
cough, and unto others it fell besides their mouths, and upon their faces,
which did run down upon their breasts. All this the king was very glad to
see, who looking toward the Captain General, spoke unto him by an
interpretour, willing him to speak unto those that were there, and to tell them
his pleasure, and likewise to report unto him of theirs, with this the Captain
General was nothing contented, for yt he thought the same a disgracing unto
him, and answered by ye interpretor yt he was the king of Portingales
Ambassador, which was a mighty king, and that the christian princes did not
use to receive their imbassage by a third person, but by themselves, and that
before very few, and those yt were of great credit. And for that he did
accustom the same order in ye other countries from whence he came, he would not
therefore utter his imbassage but only unto ye king himself, unto which the king
answered yt he liked well thereof, and that it should be so observed, and
immediately he commanded the Captain General and Fernan Martines to be
carried unto another chamber which was adorned with ye like estate as the other
was, and as well hanged, and after yt the Captain general was there, y^ king
came thither also, but our men remained where they were first, and this was
about the Sun set. The king as soon as he was come into this chamber went to
his Estrado, there came no more with him but his interpretor and the Bramene
Mayor, and the old man which does always give this Vitele unto ye king, The
message that was sent to ye king of Calicut from ye king of Portingal
and controler of his house. The king and they being there together, he asked of
ye captain general of what part of ye world he was and what he would have:
whereunto he answered, that he was an Ambassador of a christian king of ye
Occident part, and of a kingdom called Portingale, besides many others,
insomuch yt he is of a great power both in possessions and people, and much
more in riches, and all other things necessary, more then any other king of
those parts, and has so ben for ye space of these lx. years, so y^ those yt
have been kings his predecessors, having the fame brought unto them, how y^ in
the Indias there, were christian kings and great noble men, in especial ye
king of Calicut, they were moved the rather to send to discover ye same by
their Captains, and to make friendship with the king of y^ country, and to
take them for brothers as reason does bind the king his Master now to do, and
to visit them by his Ambassadors, not yt he has any need of their riches, for
that in his own countries of gold and silver and other things of great value,
he has more thereof then need did require. And as for those Captains whom he
did send unto this discovery, they have gone in the same a year or two,
until such time as they have consumed their victuals and without finding of
that which they sought for, have returned to Portingale, and have in vain
spent great sums of money. But the king Don Manuel which reigns as now, and
is desirous to make an end of this enterprise, which was begun so long time
agone, for that to them there should not lack sufficient victuals, as there did
unto the others before, did therefore give him three ships that were laden
therewith, commanding him not to return to Portingale without the discovery of
that king of the christians which is Lord of Calicut. And if so be yt he should
return without bringing him relation thereof, he would then command his head
to be cut off. And further he willed him y^ if so be y^ he should chance to
arrive at the place where the king was, to deliver him two letters, which he
would present unto him the next day, for yt it was then somewhat late. And also
that he should tell him that he was his friend and brother, requesting him that
since that he does send so far of to seek him out, that in recompense thereof
he would accept of his kindred, and friendship, and also that he would send
him his Ambassador for the better confirmation of the same, and yt from thence
forth they would visit one the other with their ambassadors, as it is
accustomed amongst christian kings. The king showed himself to be well
pleased with this Embassage, An Ambassador promised from Calicut.
for he told the Captain General that he was very well welcome. And since
that the king of Portingale would be his friend and brother, he would be the
like unto him, and upon the same would send him his Ambassador, which thing the
Captain General did desire most earnestly, for that he durst not show
himself before ye king his Master without him. The king did therefore promise him
so to do, and that forthwith, he would dispatch him thither. After y^ he was
desirous to know ye whole estate of ye king of Portingale perticularly, and how
far of yt country lay from Calicut, and how long he had been upon that voyage.
And for yt part of the night was well spent, ye king willed him to retire,
demanding of him first, whether he would go lie amongst the Moors or amongst
the Christians, who answered that he would lie with neither of them, but alone,
and by himself. The king upon his answer commanded a certain Moore which was
his factor to go and accompany ye Captain general, and commanded to give him
al things yt were necessary.

How the Captain General was minded to send a present to the king, but his
company would not consent to the same, and how the Moors began to bring the
Captain general out of credit with the king. cap. 18.
THe Captain general being dispatched to go toward his lodging (although yt
four hours of the night were past) the Catual and the others y^ had
accompanied him before, did now the like, and they all going afoot, there fell
such rain, that ye streets ran full thereof, and therefore he was driven to
command some of his men to carry him upon their backs, (not for the water
only) but for y^ it would be late or ever y^ he could come to his lodging, with
this ye Captain general was so angry, y^ he complained upon ye kings Factor,
demanding whether he meant to carry him about the city all ye night or not,
who answered yt he could do no otherwise, for yt ye city was great and
scattered, and so he carried him to his own house, to rest himself a while.
And afterward he gave him a horse, upon ye which he might ride. And for yt this
horse was without a saddle, ye Captain would not accept the offer, saying, ye yet
rather he would go a foot, and so he went until such time he came to his
lodging, where those y^ did accompany him, left him in a good lodging. And
before his coming, his men had brought thither his stuff, where ye Captain
general having rested himself, and being in great joy to see so good
beginning of his business, determined on the next day being Tewsdaie, to send
a present to the king. And for that he knew he could not send the same, but
that the Factor and the Catuall should have the oversight thereof, did therefore
send for them that they might have the view thereof, A present for ye king of
Calicut.
who being come, he showed the same unto them, which was four Capi^sis of
grain, and six hattes, four branches of Gorall, twelve Almasares, a fardell
of Brass, in the which there were seven pieces, a Chest of Sugar, two Barrels
of Oil, and two of honnie. The Factor and the Catuall having seen these
parcels, began to laugh thereat, saying, that ye same was nothing to present the
king withal, for that the poorest Merchant that comes to his port does give
him much more then the same, wishing him that since he would needs give him a
present, to send him some gold, for that the king would not accept any other
thing. At this their answer the Captain general was offended, and so he
showed himself to be, saying, that if so be he were a Merchaunt or that his
coming thither were to trade, he would then have brought him gold: But he was
no Merchaunt but an Ambassador, which was the cause he brought none with him,
and that this which he does now send to ye king of Calicut, is his own goods,
and not ye king his Masters, who for that he did not certainly know that he
should have met with the king of Calicut, did therefore give him nothing to
present him withal: but at his next return knowing for certeintie that he
shall find him, the king his Master will send him gold, silver, and other
rich things. To this they answered and said that it might be so, howbeit it was
accustomed in that country, ye whatsoever stranger he be that does come and
speak with the king, he sends hm a present, which is according to ye
greatness of his estate. Unto which the Captain general did reply, saying yt
it was good yt their custom should be kept, and that for the preservation of
the same, he did make him this present, which is of no greater value, for the
cause above said: And therefore he desired them to suffer him to carry the
same to the king, which if so be yt they would not let him do that, then he
would send the same back to his ships again. They answered him that
immediately he might so do, as he last determined, for that they would not
consent that the same should be carried to the King. With this answer the
Captain general was very angry, and said unto them, that since they would not
consent that he should send that present to the King, he would therefore go
himself and speak with him, and would now return to his ships. This was his
meaning, to inform the King what had past about this present. They said yt it
was well done so to do, but for so much as they should remain with him in the
Court a good while, it were for them very necessary to go about a little
business in the mean space, which they will go to do, and immediately
return to go with him, since that the King would not be pleased that he should
go without them: for so much as he was a stranger, and for that there were
many Moors in the City. The Captain general giving credit to their words
concerning their return, immediately answered them that he would tarry for
their coming: Treason conspired against the fleet
but they did not return all that day, for that they were enemies to the
Captain general, by reason of the Moors, who were his enemies also, and had
received news what he had done in Monsambicke, and of the taking of the
Sambuco in Mylynde, and that we were Christians, and that our coming was to
discover Calicut. Bontaybo also told the Moors, that Spices were esteemed in
Portingale very much, and that as he judged they were not come to discover
Calycut, but to settle there a trade, and to carry Spices into their Country,
in the which there is of all sorts of Merchaunts that come to Calycut by the
way of the straights, and great store of gold and silver, and having the Trade
settled there, would redowne unto the King great profit thereby. To the which
words the Moors gave great ear, and made their reckoning upon Bontaybos
speech, and allowed the same: That we being Christians and once come to settle
a Trade in Calycut, their commodity then would fall of the price they were at,
and so would abate the most part of their gain. About this they laid their
heads together, to work all means they could possible with the king, to take
the Captain general prisoner, and to command his ships to be taken also,
and to kill all our men, and this the rather, for that in no wise they should
return to Portingale, to carry news of Calicut. And heerevpon they joined
those that were in credit with the King, and went unto him, and one in the name
of them all, said unto the king: That he should not deceive himself with our
men, the Mores oration to the king
for that the Captain General was no Ambassador but a thief, that went to
rob, which they knew for most certain by their Factors, which had certified
them, that as soon as we were come to Monsambicke, where the Xeque went to
visit the Captain general aboard his ship, and sent him presents, and
established with him friendship, and also giving him a Pilot to carry him to
Calicut, whether he said that he would go. He after this shot his Ordinance
at the town, with the which he killed of his Subjects, and took certain
Sambucos laden with Merchaunts, and handeled both him and his like unto
Enemies. And being departed from thence to Mombassa, likewise under ye color of
friendship, saying that he was bound toward Calicut, the King thereupon took
occasion to send to visit the Captain general aboard his ship, requesting
him to enter into his harbor, who being determined so to do, whether that it
was for that he saw within the same many ships, or yt he thought he could not
make his party good, did fly away so fast, that he left one of his Ankors
behind him: and from thence also the Pilot ran away, which he carried from
Monsambicle, for the ill life which he lead with him, with whipping of him, and
putting of him unto other punishment. And being departed from Mombassa, and
come near unto Mylynde, did take perforce a Sambuco laden with Moors, of ye
which there were some that dyed in the battle, and others that are yet alive
remaining captives. And for that those that were captives willed him to carry
them to Mylynde, saying, that there they would give him a new Pilot to carrye
him to Calycut, by that means only he came thither. And having there by the
King of Mylynde been received very well, yet the Captain general would no
more come a land, fearing the hurts which he had done, and taking the Moore
prisoner which the King had sent to visit him, and would not deliver him,
until such time that he had a Pilot sent him. Where by it might well be
considered, that if so be that he were an Ambassador and were come to
maintain peace, he would never have used those disorders, but would have
brought the King a present with him. Of this his demeanor, we give thee to
understand, as our duty binds us, that now thou may do as thou shall
think good therein. The king remains doubt full what to do.
With this news the king remained amazed, and told the Moors that he would
determine himself what shall be thought most convenient: they seeing this,
thought the same not to be the way to cause the King to do as they would have
him, and did afterward tell the Catuall thereof, who was in great credit with
the King, requesting him to persuade with the King, not to receive any such
Embassage as that was, and the cause thereof the rather was, that he took this
present for so small a value. With this the Catuall went immediately to the
King, who told him what the Moors had said, to whom the Catuall gave
counsel, to do as the Moors had requested him: immediately the King began
to change his countenance against the Captain general, but not so much as
the same might be perceived. But as soon as the Moors had knowledge by the
Catuall concerning the present that the Captain general would have sent to ye
King, and that he would not consent thereunto, the Moors took occasion to go
to ye Generals lodging with a fained friendship offering themselves to
instruct him what he should best do, The fained friendship of the Mores
and talking with him they said, that in that Country it was accustomed that
those the which came from other places about business with the King, should
bring him a Present, and therefore it were good that he did send him one. The
Captain General being offended with that iniurye they had offered him, and
that the Catuall and the Kings Factour would not consent thereunto, did upon
the same take occasion to show them those pieces, the which he was minded for
to send, who having seen the same, they said to the General, that the
Catuall and the Factor had great reason to be offended thereat, for that the
same was not a present for to be sent to a King, neither would they wish him to
send it, for that it would be judged that by the sending thereof he did mock
the King: All this they told him, and as they said as friends, in showing him
their mind. Bontaybo told him also in the same manner, meruailing what was the
cause he brought no other things, since there was plenty of all things in
Portingale^ But the Captain general excused himself, saying: that he was not
certain that he should come to Calycut.

How the Captain general returning spoke with the King of Calycut, and how he
gave him license to return unto his ships. Chap. 19.
ALL this day the Captain general was greatly offended, for that the Catuall
and the Factor were not returned, so that he was once determined to go to the
Court with out them, yet he thought best to tarry till the next day, on which
in the afternoon they came, with whom he showed himself to be offended for
their long tarrieng. But they did answer him touching that matter nothing at
all, but talked of other things, and so went with him to the Court. And for
that the King was somewhat changed, as I have said, against the Captain
General, he did not command him to come into his presence in three hours
after his coming to the Coursie, and then commandment was given there should
come no more in with the Ambassador but two of his own men, with the which he
was offended, for y^ he thought the same seperating from his men, was not meant
well, did therefore carry with him Fernan Martines, and one Diego Dias, she
which was his Secretary. Being come where the King was, he did not receive him
so well as at the first time, but said unto him with a severe countenance,
that he had tarried for him all the day before, and he came not. The Captain
general answered, that he did defer his coming, for that he found himself
weary by reason of the long way, for he was very loath to tell him the cause why
he staid, for that he would not give the King occasion to talk of the present
that he would have sent him: But it did well appear that the Catuall and the
Factor would not have hindered the sending of the same unto the King, but for yt
they well knew, he would have made small account thereof. And also they must of
force have told him that they had seen the same. Nevertheless it could not
be excused, but that the King spoke unto the Captain general thereof
immediately saying: The king quarrelleth with the Captain General.
how that he had told him that he was belonging to a great and rich King, and
yet he brought no present from him, but an Embassage of friendship only, and
therefore he could not tell what friendship he would have with him, since that
he did send him nothing. Unto this the Captain general did answer, that
there was no marvel that he did bring him nothing, for that he came not in
assurance that he should meet with him. But now since that he has seen him
he should well perceive what his King and Master will hereafter send him, if
so be that God will give him leave to carry news of this his discovery. And if
so be that he will give credit to his Letters which he did bring with him, he
shall then see what the King does send him word of. The King in steed of
demanding his Letters, asked him whether the King his Master did send him to
discover stones or men, and if so be that he did send him to discover men, how
does it chance then that he sent him no present. And since that it is
manifest that he had brought him nothing, he said as then that it was told him
that he had a Sancta Maria in gold, requesting of him the same.

The Captain general was partly ashamed to see the King so altered, for that
he had not brought him a present. And now moreover to demand without all
honesty that Image. To whom he answered, that the Sancta Maria, which they
told him of, was made of wood, and gylded over and not of Massy gold. And
although that it were (yet would he not depart therewith) for so much as the same
had preserved him in the Sea, and had brought the same from his Country. The
King did not reply upon this answer, but demanded those Letters the which the
King had sent him: whereof the one was in the Portingale tongue, the other in
the Arabian language. These he told him were sent in this order, for that the
King his Master did not know whether of these two languages was understood in
his Country. Wherefore he desired that since the Portingale language was not
understood in his Country but the Arabian, and that there were Christians of
the Indias that did understand the same, one of those might read his Letter,
and the rather for that the Moors are enemies to the Christians, of whom he
was afeard, least that they should change the sense thereof. The King
commanded them so to be read: howbeit there could be found no Indian that
could read the same, or at the least would show himself that he could read
them. The Captain general seeing that there was no other remedy, but y^ the
Moors must needs read the same, was driven then to request the King, that
Bontaybo might be one of them. This was done, for yt as he thought he would
speak and use more truth then the others, for the acquaintance they had with
him. The King commanded the same to be read by other three, who having read ye
same first of all to themselves, The effect of ye king of Portingales Letters
to the king of Calycut
and afterward with a loud voice declared to the King the effect thereof, the
which was, That as soon as the King of Portingale had knowledge, yt he was one
of the mightiest Princes of all the Indias, and a Christian, he was desirous to
have a trade and a friendship with him, for that he might have out of his
Country, Spices, the which he has in great plenty, for which there comes
diverse from many places of the world thither to buy ye same. And therefore if
so be he will give him license to send for the same, that then he will send
unto him from his kingdom many things which he has not in his, as his
Captain general and Ambassador will tell him. And if so be that with those
things he were not pleased, he will send him money both of gold and silver to
buy them withal, and how that as well of his Merchaundize as of the money, yt
Captain general could show him part. The King hearing this, as he was
desirous that for the increase of his rents there should come many Merchaunts
unto Calycut, showed himself to be well pleased with this letter, and also made
unto the Captain general a better countenance then he did before, and asked
him what Merchaundize there were in Portingale. He named many, showing how that
of all he had brought with him part, and also of their money, requesting him
license to go aboard for the same, and in the mean while he would leave in his
lodging four or five of his men. The King giving more credit to that which he
spoke, then to that the Moors had told him, said unto him, yt he might go in a
good hour, and carry his men with him, for there was no necessity that they
should remain a land, and that he should bring his Merchandise, and sell them
as well as he could. With this lycense he remained well content, for (as he saw
ye King make him at the first an ill countenance) so he thought yt he would not
have given him ye same, and with this license he went first to his lodging,
being by ye Kings commandment accompanied with the Catuall: and for so much as
that day was all spent, he would, not go aboard that night.

How the Captain general having l^cense of the King to go to his ships, was
staid by the Catuall in Pandarane. Chap. 20.
THe next day after, which was the last day of May, the Catuall sent to the
Captain general a Horse, howbeit without any furniture to the same, upon
which he might go to Pandarane: And for that the Horse came after that order,
he would not accept his offer, but rather requested him for one of his Andors,
the which he sent him immediately, and on the same he went to Pandarane, and
all his men came after him on foot. There went to bear him company many
Nayres, the Catuall did remain in Calicut, and when the Moors had notice that
he should there stay, and that the Captain general was gone toward his
ships, supposing that he went for altogether, were sore amazed therewith,
whereupon the Moors took occasion to go to the Catuall, the Mores make a
new conspiracy.
with large offers of money to pursue the Captain general, and under a fained
pretense to lay hands upon him and to take him prisoner, for that they would
find occasion to kill him: and he by this means should remain in no fault
thereof at all. And albeit that the King would punish him for so much as he did
keep him prisoner, yet they would not fear but to get him his pardon. With
this bribe and promise he did depart immediately, and went in such have after
him, that he past by our men which did remain behind the Captain general,
for that they were not able to go much, by reason of the heat. The Catuall
having overtaken the Captain general, asked him why he did make so much have,
or where he were now running away: this was spoken by signs, y^ which the
Captain general did understand, who answered him also by signs that he did
run away to fly the heat. And being come to Pandarane, for that his men as
yet did not appear, the Captain general told the Catuall that he would not
go into the village, until his men were come, and there he tarried for them
in a house, wherein he rested himself from the rain: howbeit they came not
until it was almost Sun set, for so long he did tarry for them because they
had lost their way. But after that they were come, the Captine general told
them, that then it was not time to leave him, whereas if so be that they had
come sooner, he had been as then in his Ship.

Whereupon, immediatelye he did demand of the Catuall a Boat or Pinnace
for to go aboorde in, who for that he pretended an other thing, answered
him, that it was very late, and that the ships did ride far, and going in
the night he might miss them, and therefore that it were a great deal better
to tarry until ye next day. To ye which the Captain general made him a
plain answer, that if so be that he would not give him an Almadias or
Pinnace, he would immediately return to the king and complain upon him,
for so much as the king had sent him to his ships, and he would seem to stay
him, which was very ill done, since that he was a Christian as they were. This
was spoken with such a color as if he would have returned to Calicut.
Dissimulation in ye Catuall
The Catuall for to dissemble with him the more, did make him a countenance as
though he would give him thirty Almadias, if he would have so many. Howbeit
he told him that he did counsel him for the best, and to remain. But if so
be that he would go he was contented therewith. Thus on one part he sent to
seek out Almadias or Pinnaces, and on the other part commanded the owners of
the same to hide themselves out of the way because they should not deliver the
same. In the mean season while they went to seek those Pinnaces, the Captain
General went along the water side, and for that he had an evil suspicion of
their dealing, for that which they had done to him in Calicut, he commanded
Gonsallo Peers, a Mariner, with other two of his men, to go before as fast as
they could, and see if they could find Nicholas Coello with his boats to will him
to keep himself out of the way, for so much as he was afeard least yt the Catual
would send to take his boats, with all those that were with him in the same,
Gonsallo Peers with the other went about that business whilst the Catuall
went in the mean season so leaserly to provide for this boat, that the night
drew on, so that it was three hours within night ere he could hear of any
thing what he had done, and what for that and also to tarrye the coming of
those that went to Nicholas Coello, the Captain General was the willinger to
stay there that night. After that the Catuall had placed the General in a
Moors house, told him that he would go to seek out Gonsallo Peers, and the
other two that went with him. Howbeit he came not back till it was the
morning. And as soon as the Captain General had fight of him, immediately he
required a boat for to go in unto his ships. But as soon as the Catuall
heard him, he then spoke unto his Nayres that were there present in his
language, who afterward willed the Captain General to command his ships to
be brought near unto the shore, and that being done he should have license
to go his way, with this the Captain General was somewhat afearde, howbeit
he answered him with a stout stomach, that as long as he was on land, he
would command no such matter to be done, for so much as then his brother would
judge him to remain in prison, and that he did command the same to be done
more for fear then any thing else, whereupon he would immediately depart toward
Portingal, without him.

To this the Catuall made answer with the others that were with him, The
Catuals purpose opened.
speaking with a stoutnesse, that if so be that he would not do that which was
willed him to do, y^ then they will not let him go a board. To the which
showing himself to be therewith offended, he made answer that if so be that
they would not let him go, that then he would return to the king of Calicut,
and make his complaint, who if then he would stey him in his countris, y^ then
he would be very glad to dwell in the same. The Catuall thereupon willed him so
to do, and to go to the king to make his complaint, but yet for all his saying
he would not consent thereunto, for that he had commanded the doors of his
lodging to be kept shut, placing within the same sundry Nayres with their
weapons. And if so that any of our men should go forth, there were appointed
many of the enmyes to withstand them. Nevertheless it was Gods pleasure that
the Catuall durst not venture to kill the Captain General, nor yet any of his
men for all that the Moors had bribed him with a great sum of money, and
for all that he was in great credit with the king, for he stood in such a
fear thereof, that he durst not do it.

Tho cause why he required the ships to be brought to the shore side was,
for that they being there, the Moors might the better lay the same a boorde,
and so take them and kill all those that were within them, which thing for that
it did so manifestly appear to the Captain General, he would not command the
Ships to be brought any nearer. And also for that the same was so
appareaunt unto the others of his men that were with him. They gave him
counsel not to deal therein. The Catuall seeing that he would not command
those Ships to be brought near the shore, and for that there was no cause
to stay him or offer him any wrong, and seeing that he could not kill him,
did then begin to request him to bring his Sails and the Rudder of the
Ships a land. With that the Captain General began to laugh, saying, that
he would neither do the one, nor yet the other, since that the king did give
him free license to go without any condition.

And therefore he willed him to do what he would, and how that of all the
iniuryes which he had offered him, the king should be made privy, who he
knew would do him justice, but yet for all this, both he and his remained
in some fear of suspect, although they did not outwardly show the same.

At length the Captain General with the rest feigning themselves to be an
hungered, The Generals ineffectual excuse.
and that they were unprovided of victuals, did request him that some of his
men might go to provide the same, and he would remain alone, but for all
that the Catuall would not agree thereunto. Now our men being in fear to
see themselves in such a danger. Then came Gonsallo Peers, supposing that the
Captain General had been at his liberty, and that they were tarrieng for him
and the others, who told him that he had met with Nicholas Coello, and
with the others which tarryed for him with their Boats a land.

This news being brought to the Captain General, he was afeard least the
Catuall should know thereof, which if he had known indeed he would have sent
Pinnaces and many men in them, Gonsallo Peers sent back to the ships
for to have taken them. Therefore did he procure by all the means he could,
that Gonsallo Peers should secretlye return, from thence unto their ships,
and put themselves in good order. And also that he should go with them and
inform them in what case he does remain. Nicholas Coello having received this
dispatch, did forthwith depart, and that in have, and immediately after he was
departed, the Catuall was advertised thereof, who sent after him sundry
Pinnaces well appointed, but yet they could not overtake him, and therefore
they returned again unto the Catuall. Then the Catuall after that they were
come did once more request the Captain General to write unto his brother to
bring the ships near to the land, but he could not persuade the Captain
General so to do, saying that if he should do it, yet his brother would not
consent thereunto, and although he would, yet he knew that the company would
not. To this the Catuall did replye, that he should not make him believe that,
for so much as he did well know that all things should be done as he would
command. Howbeit the Captain General would write no such letter; for that he
was afeard of the bringing of the ships so near the shore, for the causes
above mentioned.

How the Catuall was contented that the Captain General should go to his
ships, and after that what chanced. cap. 21.
AFter this sort they spent that day, in the which our men remained in great
fear, for so much as in the night they were put in a great yard that was
underfoot laid with Brick, and compassed about with walls, and also had to
keep them far more men then they had in the day. Then the Captain General
perceived by the countenance of his men y^ they feared least they should be
departed ye one from ye other yt next day after, as he himself suspected the
like, although he gave no outward show thereof, but rather had a confidence,
that as soon as the king of Calicut had knowledge after what sort they were
stayed, would command them to be released, for that he did never use with him
double dealing, it was thought that the Catuall did stay the Captain General
after this order, The generals constancye marueled at by the Catuall
because he should give him some reward. And for that he would give as it were
no outward show that he was offended, he would needs come to supper to him
that night, at the which they had both Rice and Hens, which he commanded to
be bought the day before. The Catuall did much marvel to see how little they
did pass for their close keeping, after that sort, and of the great constancy
of the Captain General, that he would not command those ships to be
brought near to the shore, nor yet condescended to any of the other his
request. And for that he thought that it was but a follye to keep him
prisoner, thereby the rather to constrain him to do it, it was Gods pleasure
to put him in the head to set him at liberty, for fear least that the king
should know thereof, for that he gave him free liberty to go to his
ships. The next day which was Saturday the second of June, he then told
him, that since he had certified the king that he would bring his Merchandise a
land, he should command the same to be brought. For it was a custom that
whatsoever Merchants did come to Calicut, he should immediately upon the same
command his Merchandise to be brought a land and his men also, and they not to
return unto their ships, until such time that they had sold the same,
notwithstanding as soon as the Merchandise were come, he would then let him go
aboard his ships. And although his words were with the Captain General of
small credit to send unto his brother a certain dispatch for them, yet he did
not let to tell him, that immediately he would send for them, if so be that
they would give him Almadias or pinnaces, in the which the same might be
brought, for that his brother would not consent that his boats should come a
land, until such time that he were there himself, with this the Catuall was
content for that he thought to make himself possessour of the Merchandise,
having a special hope that they were of a great value, as the Captain
General had told him.

Then he dispatched two of his men with a letter unto his brother, The effect
of ye Generals letters unto his brother.
in the which he had made relation after what sort he did remain. And that
he had no other injury offered him, but that he kept his lodging. And for any
thing else he was very well, willing him that he should send him part of the
Merchaundise to content the Catuall withal, that he might let him depart. And
after that he had received the same, if then he would not let him go, he
would then believe that he did keep him prisoner, by the King of Calicuts
commandment, who he knew would not command the same, except it were to take
his ships, which he would not do, but having time to arm his own Fleet,
and so to set upon them, wherefore he advertised them that if so be were not
set at liberty, immediately after y^ the Merchandise were landed, that then they
should not remain there any longer, but go their ways toward Portingale, and
inform the king his Master what had chanced unto him, and also what he had
done, that there might not be lost a Country of so great a profit for
Portingale as that was, and also to tell him after what sort that he did
remain there, and what confidence he had in his highness that he would
send him such a Fleet of ships and men, that by the same he does hope to be
set at liberty, being assured that as now they would not kill him.

He that carried these letters being come to Paulo de la Gama, did deliver
them unto him, giving unto him large instructions of all that which they had
past, since they did depart. Now Paulo de la Gama having seen this Letter
which was sent him from the Captain General, His brothers aply
did send immediatlye the merchaundise with an answer to this Letter, in the
whsch he said, that GOD would not permit him to return to Portingale
without his company. And if so be that their enimyes would not set him at
lyberty, that then he did hope in GOD that he would strengthen those few
that remained in the Fleet, with whom and with the Ordinance that they have,
he would come and set him at lyberty, and of this he might make full
account, and of no other thing.

The Merchaundise being landed, the Captain General did deliver the same unto
the Catual, and also to Diego Dyas whom he left for* Factour of the same, and
to Aluora de Braga the Scriuenor, who remained in a house which the Catuall had
sought out for them. In this space the Captain General made himself in a
readynesse to go aboorde his ships, but first the Catuall did reform, and
make himself friends with him.

After that he was a boorde, he would send no more Merchaundise a land,
until such time he heard news the same were sold, neither yet would go
any more a land, because he would run in no such danger, with this the
Moors were grievously offended, for that they thought that if so be that he
would come a land, that there they might do him more hurt then a Seaboorde.

And for that they would the rather so do, they began to make a mock at the
merchandise which he had left a land. Also they wrought all the means they
could to hinder their sales thereof, saying yt they were little or nothing worth.
Of all this ye Captain general was informed, devises of the Mores to entise the^
aland.
and for y^ as he thought the king knew nothing of all these things, neither
yet what discurtesie the Catuall had offered him, and for that he should
understand the cause why the Captain General did not return a land, neither
yet would send any more merchandise, he did therefore send him word within five
days after hy his Factour of all that they had done unto him, and also what
iniurye the Moors had showed him, touching their Merchants, promising
notwithstanding, that he would not let to be at his commandment with all the
whole Fleet. Then the king seemed to be very greatly offended for that which
they had done to ye Captain general, insomuch as he had sent him unto his
ships. But for all that the Catuall went unpunished, although he sent the
Captain General word, that he would punish those that had so used him, which
out of doubt were naughty christians, so that it did well appear that it
grieved him very much to hear thereof. And as touching the Merchaundise he
promised to send thither such as should buy the same, as he did indeed
seven or eight Merchauntes, which are Gentiles Gusarates, and with his Factour
he sent a Nayre, which was a principal honest man, to the intent he might
remain in the Factorye with the Factour, to whom he gave commandment
diligently to beware that there should not come any Moors to kill him.

But for because that this was done but under couloure that the Moors should
not seem to subborne the Merchauntes, they bought nothing, but rather did
abate the price, of the which the Moors were very glad, and said, that now
it did well appear that they were not alone that would not buy of their
Merchaundise, yet for all that there durst come no Moore to the Factorie, they
once having notice that there was placed a Nayre by the kings commandment.
And if so be that before they did not abide or love us, they ten times worse
loved us afterward, so that whenever any of our men should come a land, they
received the same as an injury done unto them, spitting on the ground, saying:
Portingale, Portingale. But our men which understood their meaning did laugh
thereat, to the end thereby they might see how little they did esteem their
doings, for so the Captain General commanded them to do. Now perceiving
that there was none that would buy of the Merchants, he supposed the cause to
be for that they lay in a place where there were no Merchaunts.

And therefore supposing that if so be that they were in Calicut, where other
Merchants are, he should sell the better, did therefore ^^ue ye King of Calicut
by a messenger for license to send the same, Their merchandise paid for by ye
king him self
which he gave immediately, and commanded the Catuall to see the same brought
forthwith, and to such as should carry them, to see them paid at his own
costs and charges, for that he would not that any thing of ye king of
Portingales, should be at any charges in his Country, and so it was done: but
for all this the Captain general would never come more a land, for that which
the Catuall had done unto him, and for that Bontaybo which came to see him
many times, did give him counsel so to do, for that the King was moveable,
and therefore it was possible that the Moors would alter his mind, for the
great credit that they were of with him. But the Captain general was very
wary, and because that he was a Moore, Bontaybo used, but not trusted.
he would not much trust him, neither yet would give him account what he was
minded to do: yet for that he would seem to have him in some reputation that
he should bring him always news of that which did pass on shore, he
departed with him both money and other rewards.

How the Captain general being desirous to return toward Portingale, sent
to demand lycense of the King to have a Factor and a Scriuener, with such
Merchaunts as he thought good: and how the King caused the messenger with one
other, that was found a shore to be craried to prison. Chap. 22.
THe Merchaunts being brought to Calicut, the Captain general therewith gave
all his men license to go and see the City of Calycut, and to buy there what
they thought good, so that there went out of each ship every day a man, and
those being returned, there went immediately others. And as they went on this
order, they were carried to the Gentiles houses where they had good cheer, and
also when occasion served might have among them good lodging. The like
courtesy they did receive in Calicut, besides they did report unto our men of
all such things as they had, and after the self same manner, our men did
bestow amongst them part of that they carried, which were bracelets of Brass
and of Copper, Pewter, and apparel, which they carried to sell in Calicut, or
any other place, where they might go as quiet as in Lishborne. From the land
there went aboard both Fisher men and Gentiles to sell their Fish, Co^os and
Hens, which they gave in trucke of biscuit and for ready money. Others there
were that went thither with their children, who carried nothing with them to
sell, but only their going was to see our ships. The Captain general was very
glad of their coming, and commanded to give them meat: this he did for to
increase the friendship between the King of Calicut and them. After this
order, the ships were never without some, and those yt were there, remained till
such time that night drew on, and then they were bid to go their way. After
this sort they spent their time till it was the x. day of August, the which was
the beginning of the season wherein they might depart from the Coast of the
Indias, The end of ye vvinter in the Indias.
and also for that as then their winter did make an end. The Captain general
perceiving the quietness of the people and Country, and the familyaritie they
used with our men, and how quietly they went in Calicut, without receiving
either hurt of the Moors or of the Nayres, did credibly believe that this came
to pass, for that the King of Calycut would have peace and friendship with the
King his Master, was the occasion that almost in three months that our men had
trade in Calycut they did receive no manner hurt, either of the Moors or of
the Nayres. He did therefore determine to establish the Factorie which was
there, with all such Merchandise as he had left at that present (although the
least part thereof was sold) for that there was now laid a good foundation
or ground work, for the next voyage when it should please the King his Master
to send again, and if it might please God to give him life, that he might
bring him news of this Discovery, so that it should not be needful to make
any new consent or agreement for the Factorie. And by the counsel of his
Captains and of the other Principalls of his ships, he sent unto the King of
Calicut a present, of skarfes of sundry colors, of silks, Coralls and other
things, which was carried unto him by Diego Dias, desiring the King to pardon
him, for that he was so bold as to send him that present, considedering he did
the same for no other purpose, but only to show what seruitour he was of his,
who is and will be always at his commandment, which was the occasion that he
sent it, and not for that he thought that things of so small value, were of
sufficient dignity, for to represent a King withal of so great a power as he
was. And if so be that he had in his custody, that which he might esteem or
think to be of a more worthy price, he would send it with a better good will.
And for that the time now drew near ye he determined to depart, he ordained
for the same, and also if so be that he did mind to send any Ambassador to
the King his Master to confirm the amity or friendship between them, he
desired him to command him to be in a readiness, for that he had a confidence
that as touching that which he had agreed upon with his highness, as also
presuming on ye gifts which he had received at his hands, yt he might as he was
desirous, leave in Calicut that Factor with his Scriuenor and the Merchandise
which he had left, not only for a witness of a perpetual peace and friendship
settled there with his highness, but also for a testimony of the truth of his
Embassage, and of that which ye King his Master should send hereafter, as soon
as he had news of him, and also for confirmation of his discovery and to get
some credit in Portingale, he did therefore send to kiss his hands, requesting
him to send to ye king his master one Bahar of cinnamon, and another of cloves,
and another of some other spices, and as soon as ye factor did make any ready
money of his wares, he should pay for ye same, for so much as at y^ present he had
not wherewith to pay. After that Diego Dias had received his message, there
past four days before the King would consent that he should come in his
presence, although that he went every day unto his Pallaice. After that he had
commanded him to come into his presence, he viewed how and after what sort he
came laden, and thereupon asked him with a frowning countenance, what it was
that he would have: but Diego Dias at that time was afearde, that he would
command him to be killed. But after that he had told him his message and would
have delivered him the present, he would not see it, but commanded it to be
delivered to his Factor. The answer that he gave touching the Captain
general was, that since he would needs go his way, The kings aunsvvere unto
Diego Dias.
he might so do: but first or that he do depart, he must give him 600.
Serasynes, for so it was the custom of the Country. Diego Dias being returned
with this present, was accompanied by many Nayres, which he seeing, thought it
to be for the best: but as soon as he was come to the Factorie, Diego Dias
kept in prison,
they remained at the door, and would not consent, that he or any other
should come forth. And after this proclamation was made in all the City, that
upon pain of death there should go aboard our Fleet no boat or Almadias: but
yet notwithstanding all this Bontaybo went, and gave warning to the Captain
general in secret, not to go a land, nor consent that any of his should
go: for that he knew for most certain by the Moors, that if so be that he or
they should so do, the King would command their heads to be stricken off.
And as touching all his fair words and good entertainment, which he had showed
him unto that present, as also to give him a house in the which his Merchandise
might be laid, as also the good entertainment that our men had, was but mere
dissimulation, and to the end, he might have taken him a land with them, and
so have commanded them all to be killed, which was wrought by the industry of
the Moors only, which had made the King believe, that they were thieves and
went a rouing, and that he came not unto his Harbor, but to steal such
Merchandise as should be brought to the City, and also to epsy the Country,
and after to come with a great Fleet for to invade the same. In the self same
order was the Captain general informed by two Malabars, which are Gentiles,
being therefore now in a study what was best to be done, having this
advertisement for most certain, as soon as it was night, there came aboorde
the Generals ship, a slave of the color black, which was naturally borne in
Guynee, and belonged unto Diego Dias and also was a Christian, and had the
Portingall tongue very well, who told him that Diego Dias and Aluoro de Braga
did remain in prison, and what answer the King of Calycut had made to his
message, and what he had commanded to be done with his present, and also what
Proclamations there were made: Diego Dias, for that he thought good to give him
knowledge of yt which had past, had bribed a Fisher man to carry this
messenger, and that in the night season that he might not be known. After that
the Captain general had heard all this, he was much offended therewith:
howbeit, for that he would see the end thereof, would not depart, but did let
pass that day, to see whether that any would come aboard him. The next day
which was Wednesdaye, Boys sent for spies
being the xv. of August, there came one onlyPinnace or Almadia aboard the
General, in the which were four boys, which brought fine precious stones to
sell, and for that they came after such sort he took them to be spies, and
that their coming was for no other purpose but to see what they did: and by
this means he thought he might understand in what reputation they were with
the King. This was the occasion the Captain general did receive them with as
good a countenance as he did before, giving them nothing to understand yt he
knew of the imprisonment of Diego Dias, and would not therefore lay hand upon
those, but upon such as should come afterward (which as he thought should be
of more credit) until such time as he had recovered those that were
imprisoned.

Unto those also he wrote a Letter by those Boys, with fained words, saying
that he did understand of their imprisonment: this was done in such order,
that if so be this letter should have come to any other men's hands, they could
not have understood the same. These Boys did deliver unto him this letter, who
afterward told the king what great entertainment they had at the Captain
generals hands, which made him to believe that he knew nothing of the
imprisonment of his men, whereof he was very glad and did return and send
aboard others, and those that should go had warning given them not to
disclose, The king of Calicuts treson toward the Captain general.
that the Factour with the others did remain prisoners. This was done by
policy, for that he made this reckoning to deceive the Captain general on
this sort, until such time that he was able to send a Fleet of ships upon
him, or til that the ships of Meca, should come and take him. On this sort went
the Malabars aboard, unto whom the Captain general made a good countenance,
and commanded them to be entertained very well: all this he did for yt he saw
none worth the staieng. On the Sunday next, there came six principal Malabars,
with other fifteen which waited upon them, in another Pinace. And for that the
Captain general thought that for those the King would send him his Factor and
his Scriuenour, he laid hands upon them all, only he left two Mariners in a
pinace, by whom he sent a letter to the kings Factors, Certain Malabars stayed
in exchange
written in the Malabars tongue, in the which he demanded for the Factor and
his Scriuenor, and then he would send those which he had staid. The kings factor
having perused this letter, he informed ye king of y^ which had past, who
commanded, the Factor and Scriuenor to be brought home to his house as
prisoners, that he might from thence send for them, and to dissemble therewith
as though he knew nothing of their imprisonment, and so cause them to be sent
from thence to the Captain general, for that he might send him those Malabars
which he had detained, whose wives made exclamation for the imprisonment of
their husbands. And therefore the King was the more willinger to set our men at
liberty, who afterward remained a while in the Kings Factors house.

How the Captain general seeing the delays were made for that the Factor with
the Scriuenor came not, did bring himself in a readiness as though he would
depart immediately, whereupon without any further delay, the King sent them
away, and what else happened. Chap. 23.
THe captain general seeing yt they came not, determined to prove whether yt
with showing himself as though he would depart immediately, they would the^ send
them to him, did therefore on wednesday, being the xxiii. of August command to
wey his Ankor, and to bring himself under sail. And for that the wind was
contrary he was driven to come to an Ankor four leagues from Calicut, riding
in an open road, and there they remained till the next Saturday, to see whether
they would send their prisoners. And perceiving no likelihood thereof, he went
yet further into the Sea, so far, that he scarcely could descry any land, and
being at an Ankor for lack of wind, there came thither a boat with certain
Malabars, which told ye Captain general yt their coming was to seek him
out, and to tell him y^ Diego Dias with ye others, were in ye kings pallaice,
whom he minded to send aboard, Yet (...) devices to slaye the Portingals from
departing
which thing to be true they would bind themselves yt as ye next day they
should be brought. And ye cause why they brought the^ not as then, was for that
they thought they should not overtake him. Now for yt they saw not yt Malabars
yt the General kept as prisoners, thought yt they were all dead. This crafty
dealing was for no other purpose, but to dally with ye Captain general, and to
stay him with those words, that the King might in the mean while prepare in
Calicut an army of ships to set upon him and to tarry for the ships of Meca,
to join with his Fleet. After this the Captain general commanded those of
the town, to go their way and not to return without his men, or else their
letters, for if so be they did he would sink them with his ordinance. And also if
immediately they did not return with an answer, yt then he would cut off the
heads of those which he had taken. With this answer, those of the town did
depart, and immediatelye as soon as they had wind, he made sail, and
bearing along the Coast, came to Ankor at the Sun set over against Calycut.

The next day our men descryed coming seven Almadias, which came aboard the
Captain generals ship, in the one whereof came Diego Dias and Aluoro de
Braga, and in the others there came many others of the country, howbeit, there
were none that durst enter within their ships, but did put Diego Dias and
Aluoro de Braga in his own boat which they had at their stearne, and
afterward they themselves fell further off, tarrieng for the Captain
Generals answer. To whom Diego Dias said, That as soon as the King of
Calicut knew that he was gone, he sent for him from his Factors house and
showed himself joyful, as one that knew nothing of his imprisonment, and
asked him what was the occasion that the Captain General took those men
which he does keep as prisoners, who afterward told him the cause: whereupon
the King made answer, that it was well done. He asked him also whether that
his Factor had demanded at his hands any thing of gift, speaking against his
own Factor which was there present, for that he knew well enough yt it was not
long ago, since he commanded one other to be killed, for taking certain bribes
of Merchaunt scraungers. After all this, he willed him to tell the Captain
general that he should send him ye stone which he promised him to be set in
the Country, upon the which there is a Cross and the royal Arms of
Portingale, and also to know of him whether he be content to leave Diego Dias
for Factor in Calicut, and with the same he sent him a letter for the King of
Portingale, which was confirmed and signed by the King, and written by Diego
Dias and with this Letter, he sent Aluoro de Braga. The Captain general took
this Letter, which was written in a certain Leaf of a Palm Tree, upon the
which they do use to write matters, that shall endure a long time, the effect
whereof was this.

Vasco de la Gama, a Gentleman of thy house came to my Country, The effect of
ye king of Calicuts letters.
of whose coming I was very glad. In my Country there is great store of
Cinnamon, Cloaues, and Pepper, and precious stones. That which I am desirous to
have out of thy Country, is Silver, Gold, Coral, and Skarlet. The Captain
General for that he saw the king to use no truth, would not answer for all
his offers, but therewith sent him all such as he had stayed that were
Nayres, and for all the others, he sent him word, he would not send them,
until such time that he sent him all such merchaundise as he had taken of his.
Notwithstanding he sent him the stone he sent for, and with this answer
departed those that brought Diego Dyas aboard. The next day there came a board
Bontaybo who told the Captain General that he came so sodeinly away from
Calicut for that the Catuall by the kings commandment had taken from him all
that he ever had, saying that he was a christian, and that his coming to
Calicut over land was by the king of Portingales commandment only to be his
spy. Other matters there were which he told him of, and that the same came by
the Moors procurement, the which he knew well, that as they took his goods, so
they meant to do him some shrewd turn in his person, if so be that they
could have taken him, and therefore he came his way before. The Captain
General was very glad of his coming, and told him that he would carry him
to Portingale, and that there he should recover all his goods with the double,
Bontaibo vvilling to go to Portingal
besides other rewards that the king his Master would give him. He commanded
also that in his ship there should be prepared him a principal good cabine.
After this about ten of the clock, there came a boorde the Captain General
three Pinnaces laden with men, and upon certain of their seats or benches,
there was laid certain Skarfs, as who should say, there came part of their
Merchaundise. And after these there came other four one after another. And as
touching those three that brought those Skarfes, they told the Captain
General that there came all their Merchandise which they would put in his
boat, and therefore they willed him to bring thither those Malabars which he
had prisoners, and that there they would fetch them. The Captain General
perceiving that this was but a fetch, did will them to go their way, for
that he would have none of their Merchaundise but those Malabars to carrye to
Portingale, as witnesses of his discovery.

And if so be that God of his divine goodness do give him life, he would
very shortly return to Calicut, and then they should well know whether that
those Christians were thieves or not, as the Moors had made the king of
Calycut believe, and therefore that was the cause why he did them so manifest
wrong. This being done he commanded to shoot of many pieces of Ordinance,
with the fear thereof they ran their way.

And if so he that the kings ships had been in a readynesse and a floate,
they had sent them against the Captanie General, but they were haled up for
because of the Winter, which was to be believed to have been the handye work
of GOD, that our Ships should be there at this season, for that they might
escape and carrye news of the discouerye of this Country, to restore in the
same the holy Catholic Faith, otherwise if it had been Summer he would have
had his Fleet in a readiness, the which was great, and so have taken us
all, and by this means there had been none left to have carried news to
Portingale.

Of the departure of the Captain General from Calycut toward Portingale, and
what further happened unto him being in the Island Ansandina. Cap. 22.
ALthough that the Captain General reioysed very much for that he had
discovered Calicut, yet he was not fully satisfied therewith altogether, for
that the king had conceived against him great displeasure, and by this means
as he judged the next fleet that the king his master, should send, would run
in great danger. Howbeit perceiving that it lay not in his power to do any
more, he was therefore contented only with the discovery, and to have known
the Indias, and of their navigations, and what was commodious for the Country,
and to have brought with him from thence examples of the spices, drugs, and
precious stones, as also of all other things that were within the same city.
And having there no more to do, he departed, carrieng with him those Malabars
which he had taken, for that by them he hoped to have some agreement made with
the king of Calicut at the return of any other Fleet. The Thursday after his
departure, being in ralme a league of from Calicut, there came toward him to
ye number of lx. Tonys full of Soldiers, by the which the king of Calicut
thought to have taken them, who seeing them coming commanded his ordinance
to be shot of at them, and that oftentimes, and if he had not done so, they
would have put him in great danger for that they followed him an hour and a
half. And by reason of a shower of rain which came upon a sodeine, the
Captain General was driven a sea board with all his Fleet, and in the mean
while the enemies fled their way, and bearing his course toward Mylinde in
great calmes, and that along the coast, thought good and convenient although ye
king of Calicut had abused him sundry ways, that for the necessity y^ those
that should return to Calicut, should have of his friendship and favor to
receive from thence their lading of Spices, to use as it were some friendship
with them, since that the king would be glad thereof, in especial being
exalted, did therefore write unto him a letter in the Arabian tongue, which was
penned in that language by Bontaybo, in the which he did crave pardon for the
carrieng away of those Malabars with him, which was done for no other intent
then that they should be as witnesses of that the which he had discovered, as
before he had sent him word. And for that he left no Factorie in Calycut
(the which he was sorry for) was for fear least that the Moors should kill
him, which was also the occasion that he was not often times a land. Yet for
all that he did not leave, but would be always at his commandment, since
that the king, his Master would be glad of his friendship, and also
forthwith would send him in his Fleet great abundaunce of all such
merchaundise as he does demand for, by the trade, that from hence forth he
should have with the Portingales in his City, would redound unto him great
profit. This letter was delivered unto one of the Malabars to carry the same a
land to the place where it was comanded to be delivered. And afterward he knew
yt the same was delivered to ye king of Calicut. Then ye Captain general going
forward in his course, and that along the coast, on the next Thursday after, he
fell amongst certain rocks, with all his Fleet, and from one of them that was
inhabited there came forth sundry Pinnaces with men, within the same to sell
them Fish, and other victuals. The Captain General did receive them very
courteously, who commanded to give them both shirts and other things, of the
which they were very glad, whereupon he took occasion to ask them whether
they would be content that there should be erected a mark with a cross in
the same, with the royal arms of Portingale, in token that the Portingals are
their friends. And they answered that they were contented, and thereby they
well knew that we were christians, and so was the mark placed, and since that
time it is called El Padron de Sancta Maria. Now to this day by the foresaid
name the rock is called. From hence as soon as the night drew on and that the
wind began to blow of the shore, the Captain General made sail, and
keeping always along the coaste on the Thursdaie after, being the 19. of
September he fell with a goodly high land, and hard to the same there lay
six little Islands, and there he came to an Ankor, and going a land to take
in water did there find a young man, which did demand, concerning the
Captain General, whether he were a Moore or a Christian, they answered him
that he was a christian. This he did as it was thought with fear, least that
they should have killed him, for so much as in that place there were no
christians. This young man did carry our men within a certain river, and
showed them most excellent water the which issued out between certain rocks,
and so: his pains they gave him a red night cap. The next morning following
there came from the land four others in a small boat a board the Captain
General, which brought with them to sell many gourds and Cowcombers, and they
were demanded by the General whether there were in that Country any Cinnamon
or Pepper. They answered that there was nothing but Cinnamon, and for that he
was desirous to see the same, Cinnamon growing.
he sent with them two of his men, the which at their return brought with them
two green boughs of certain trees which they do take to be the same,
reporting that thereof, there was a great grove, howbeit the same was wild.
And at their return there came with them more then 20. of that Country men,
which brought to sell hens, gourds, and Cowes milk. Also they requested the
Captain General to send with them certain of his men, for that shortly
after, they should return with great store of dry Cinnamon, Hogs, and
Hens, but for all their great offers, he would let none of his men go, for
that he feared least the same was some treason. The next day after before
dinner, our men going a land to cut wood somewhat far of, from the place
where they were, fell on a soddeine upon two Boats, the which lay hard by
the shore side.

The Captain General would not immediatlye procure to know what they were,
till it was after Dinner, for then he thought to know the same. And being in a
readiness to depart, did first command one of his Mariners to go up to the
top, to see whether that he could discry any other vessels a sea board or not,
who being there told him that he had sight of eight great ships which were
incalmed, with this news he left his going to see the others, and put himself
in a readiness, the wind was in such sort that it might serve them both, and
as they came within two leagues of our Fleet, the Captain General made
toward them. The enemies perceiving that, did immediately fly toward the
shore* And they bearing after this sort, was broken the Rudder of one of the
same, by reason whereof those that were within the ship were forced to go in
their boats toward the land. Nicholas Coello who was next to this ship, went
immediately and laid the same aboard, thinking indeed to find in it some
great shore of riches, howbeit there was nothing else but Cocos and Melasus,
which is a certain kind of Sugar made of Palms or Date trees. Also he found
therein many bows, arrows, swoordes, spears and targats, and the other
seven ran themselves a ground, and for that our men could not come near
unto them with their ships, they followed them in their boats, and from thence
did beat them with their ordinance, so that their enimyes were driven to
leave their ships, and being yet the next day at an Ankor, there came unto
him seven men of the country in an Almadias, who told him that those eight
ships were of Calicut, the which the king had sent for to take him, as by those
that fled away they understood.

How the Captain General went to Ansandina to take in water, and also how he
took there a Moore prisoner, which was servant to the Lord of the Island of Goa
called Sabayo, the which was taken for a spy. cap. 25.
AFter that the Captain General was thus informed, he would tarry there no
longer, but immediatlye came to an Ankor at the Island of Ansandina, the which
was distaunt from thence as it were two Gunne shot, where it was told him,
there was excellent sweet water. This Island is but little, and but a league of
from the firm land. There are in the same many woods, and also two conduit
heads, made of free stone of excellent sweet water, the which are springs and
do rise there, whereof one is six foot deep. Also in the sea about the said
Island is great store of fish. Before that the Moors did use to traficke to the
Indias, the same was inhabited by Gentiles, Ansa^dina forsaken of the
inhabitants
in the which there were goodly buildings, in especial their Pagodes was a
goodly thing. And after that the Moors which came from the red sea began to
sail that way, they resorted thither always to take in their water and wood,
and did so abuse the inhabitants that they could not well abide the same, so
that they left their dwellings there, but before their going away, they plucked
down almost all their Pagods* so that they left nothing standing but the very
Chapel, the like they did to all other their buildings, yet for all that
these Gentiles that were of the firm land, which belong to the king of
Narsingas, had to this Pagode such devotion that from thence they would go
sundry times to make in the same their prayers unto three black stones that
were lieng in the midst of the said Chapel.

The Island is called Ansandina which in the Malabars language is called the
^iue Islands, for that round about the same there lie the other four. The
Captain General having come to an Ankor, sent Nicholas Coello with his
company to discover the same, who found it according as before is declared,
and a goodlye place or ground, where they might new grave their ships. And
for that the Captain General had a great course to run, and also for that he
knew not when to find so convenient a place, he consulted with the other
Captains to bring their ships there a ground. The first ship that they
brought there a ground, They repair their ships.
was the Ship the which they called Ber^^o. And whilst they were thus
occupied, there came many people to sell them victuals. At which time there
came two small Brickentines that had out their Standerds, and Flagges in the
tops of their Mastes, and within them their Trumpettes and Drumnies,
whereupon they came playeng, at their pleasure. In these Brickentines there
came many men, and they all at the Oar, and along the shore side there were
other five which came to succor them if they should have any need.

The Captain General after that he had fight of them, had warning given
him by the Malabars to beware of them, for that they were rouers, and under a
couloure of peace, did rob all that they could take. And after that he was
entered into his ship, he perceived that he might have taken them if so be
that he would have consented to let them to come aboorde him, but he
would not agree to the same. And therefore as soon as they came within Gunne
shot, commanded all their Ordinance to be shot at them from those two
ships that were a floate. They fearing this shot, gave out a loud voice
crieng, Tambarane, Tambarane, for so they do call God, and with this often
shooting they fled their way.

Nicholas Coello being as then in his Boat, went after them always shooting
his Ordinance, who pursued them so far that the Captain General was driven
to put up his Flagge for a sign he should return, and so he did.

The next day after the Captain General with all his men being a land,
working upon the ship called Berrio, there came in two little Paraos to the
number of twelve men of the Country, the which in their apparel seemed to be
of some countenance, Sugar Canes growing there.
who brought for a present a bundell of Sugar Canes, and immediately as soon
as they had delivered the same, they asked license to go aboard and to see the
ships, for that they never saw any before. The Captain general was greatly
offended with this their request, for by that he feared least that they were
spies: and whilst they were in this talk, there came thither other two
Paraos, with as many more men. Those that came first, seeing that the Captain
general was somewhat grown in cholar, did will those that came afterward, not
to come a land but to return again. The ship Berrio being made in a
readiness, and afterward that the Generals ship was brought a ground to be new
rigged, and having a land about her, all the other Captains, there came a man
in a little Parao, who seemed to be of the age of forty years, and not of
that Country, for that he had upon him a Sabaco of fine Cotton, which reached
down to his heels, and about his head a toocke or towell, which also covered
part of his face, and at his gyrdell a Faw^^in or Skeyne. And as soon as he
leapt a land, he went immediately to embrace the Captain general as one that
had seen him or known him before, and after the self same sort he used the
other Captains, telling them that he was a Christian, and borne in Italy, and
that he was brought into that Country of a child, and that his dwelling was
with a Noble man that was a Moore, called Sabayo the which was Lord of a
certain Island called Goa, lieng about twelve leagues from thence, and had
forty thousand horsemen within the said Island. And for that his habitation was
amongst the Moors, he observed their law, howbeit it was but for an outward
show, but inwardly in his soul he was a Christian: and being in Sabayos house
it was told him, that there was come by Sea to Calycut certain men in ships,
whereof there was never seen ye like in the Indias, and that there were none
that understood their language, and also that their bodies were covered over
with clothes. And when he had understanding of the same, he immediatelye
judged them to be Frangnes, for so they do call those that are Christians in
that Country, and for that he was desirous to see them, had therefore asked
lycense of Sabayo, saying that if so be that he would not give him license to
go and see them, that he knew very well that he should dye with very thought
and anger: by reason whereof he gave him license, by whom he sent them word,
that if so be that there were in his Country any thing yt they had need of,
they should have the same, in especial ships and victualles. And moreover, if
they would come and dwell in his Country, he would be very glad thereof,
and would give both them and theirs sufficient living, with the which they
should live very honorably.

After that he had ended thus his talk, the Captain general asked him
perticularly for the Country of Sabayo, and other things: Whereupon he
requested of the Captain general a chief for to send to a companion of his,
which remained in the firm Land, for that it was agreed between them, that
if so be that he were well entertained, that he would send unto him a token
in sign thereof. This kind of dealing made the Captain general suspect him,
notwithstanding, he commanded a chief to be given him, and also two new
loaves, the which he sent to his companion as aforesaid, and he remained
always talking with the Captain General: His talk was so much, that some
time he discovered himself to be a spy.

Paulo de la Gama, which noted the same, asked of certain country men what
he was, and they up and told him, that he was a Rouer, and that he had laid
aboorde other Ships, which had been there brought a ground before that time.
The Captain General being thereof informed, commanded him to be carried
aboorde his ship, which was then a ground, and there he commanded him to
be well whipped to confess, whether that all or any part of the same was
true that he had told him, and also what he meant by his coming thither, and
whether he were a Moore or a Christian, who answered that he was a Christian
as he had said before, all the rest he denied, and therefore the General sought
one other more cruel torment then whipping, which was by hanging of him up by
his members by a pulley, to hoist him up and down: and by the great pain
which he suffered there, he requested to be let down, for that as their he
would tell him the truth: A notable cou^terfait discovered
and being come down, he declared that he was a spy, and was sent thither,
to discover how many men the Captain general had, and what weapons,
for so much as he was ill beloved along all that Coast, because he was a
Christian. A kind of boats so called
And that there were manyr Atalayas or Foysts placed in every Baye or Kricke to
set upon him: howbeit they durst not until such time as there came thither
other forty great Vessels, which were a making in a readiness for to join
with those that are armed, and so to set upon him, and to take him: and
therefore in the mean space he was sent to know what he said, he affirmed
also, that he knew not certainelye, when those forty sail would come. This
much he declared after that he had received three or four torments: all the
rest they understood by conjectures, for so much as he did not perticularlye
declare the same.

The Captain general seeing that he would declare no more, was contented with
the advice he had given him, and commanded him to prison under the hatches,
for to carry with him unto Portingale: also to be cured very well, and to
give him some refreshing of victualles. Afterward he told him that he did not
mind to keep him prisoner to have him as his Captive, but to carry him unto
the King his Master, to the end he might tell him some news of the Indias,
knowing very well that he would reward him. Now the Captain general having
knowledge of the coming of his enemies, would therefore tarry no longer then
whilst his ship was new dressing, the which was done in ten days.

At this instaunt the Captain general was offered for the ship, the which
ship he had taken of the eight, that did set upon him a thousand Fanons, but
he would not take it, saying that he would not sell any thing yt was his enemies,
but commanded the same to be burnt. The Captain Generals ship being ready
and the water being taken in, he immediately departed upon the fifth day of
October, and going a Sea board, about a two hundred leagues from thaf Island,
then the Moore which he carried with him as prisoner, seeing there was no other
remedy, said, that now he would tell him the truth how that indeed he did
dwell with the Sabayo, to whom word was brought that the Captain general went
wandering upon the Seas, as one that knew not where he was, and therefore there
was in preparing a great Fleet for to take him. The Sabayo having notice
thereof, commanded him to go thither to visit him, and to mark how they
went, and also to see whether that he could bring them to Goa, which if so be
that he could bring to pass, he would as then lay hand upon them, for that
the fame went that they were valiant, and so meant to keep them to make
wars against other Kings his next neighbors. These news the Captain
General was glad to hear of, and gave him from thenceforth better
entertainment, and allowed him both apparel and also money, and afterward he
was made a Christian, to whom he gave for name Gaspar, A Moore christened
in honor of one of the three Kings, called Magus of that name, and for that
the Captain general was his God father, he gave him the title of his surname,
and so ever after he was called Gaspar de la Gamas.

How the Captain general went forward on his Voyage toward Mylynde, and of
the great troubles he past, until such time as he came thither. Chap. 26.
FOllowing from hence his course toward Mylynde, whether he was minded to
return to take in there an Ambassador, he went always in cruel storms,
which the Captain general continually endured, until such time he had entered
the goulfe, and having always the wind right against him, it was the occasion
that the ships made but small way, and therefore it was the longer time
before he entered the gulf. But after that he was entered within the same, he
was again troubled with great calmes, which on the Sea is very troublesome, not
only for the governing of their ships, but also with the heat, which is more
hurtful upon the sea, then upon the land, for that there is no covering to
defend the Sun, Men stifled with the Sun only.
whereon with the same only men are stiffeled up, as has been seen in the
voyage toward the Indias. And as I say the wind having coursing thus with the
heates, the space of many days together, did afterward return and break up
in contrary winds to go forward, and very good to go backward. But the
Captain general being loath to go backward, would yet rather tarry there where
he was, as indeed he did. And when he perceived that the wind was so great and
the Seas went so high, that there was no tarrieng for him with his ships,
then was he driven of force to keep the Seas, sometime on this board, and
sometime that; so that both he and his men passed great troubles, by reason
they all had enough to do to govern their ships. And hoping that after so
great storms there would come fair weather, were driven once more to pray for
those great calmes which they had before. And when they saw that this weather
was like to endure many days, and that their water began to fail them, was
the occasion that the Captain General commanded the same to be delivered by
order.

And going in this necessity, and also with foul weather, the people began to
fall sick a disease in their gums, as they did in the river, De buenas
Sennal^s, when as they went to Calicut, The Skurfe.
and also their arms and legs did swell, besides other swellings which did
rise in their bodies, by reason of a pestilent stinking humor, which did cast
them into a laske, and of this new infirmity, there dyed to the number of
thirty persons. And after that they began once to die, and had continued this
kind of weather upon the Seas, there arose such a fear amongst those that did
remain alive, that they fared in the same, as it were men amazed, and believed
verily that they should never go from thence, for that as they thought this
kind of weather was always durable there, and that the same was the cause
that it endured so long. The Masters and Pilots of the Fleet were of the like
opinion, which made the rest believe it the sooner, that by this means the
cry of all those that were there, as well of them that were sick as of the
other, was great, saying that since the weather would not serve them to go
from thence, yet they requested him not to be an occasion of their death, but
rather consent to return unto Calycut, or else to some other place in the
Indias, and being there, to receive what God should appoint them, rather then to
dye in those seas of to terrible diseases, for which there was no likelihoode of
any remedy, in especial having lack of all other things, as of victuals and
water, which as then they began to want, by reason that by their long
continuance in the said place was all spent. The Captain general seeing the
great fear that his men were in, and for to animate them the more, said unto
them all on this sort, requesting them to be content, and not to believe that
such weather as was there coursed by them on that sort, was always like to
continue, for if so be that it were so, then there would be no Navigations
from the Goulph to the Strayghtes of Meca, nor to Mylynde, nor yet from any
other place, by the which they should pass: And that it was not impossible,
but that they might somewhat digress from their right course, and therefore
they met with these calmes and winds which they endured, yet those he said
should have an end, and with the same, their troubles will likewise end.

But for all this, the Mariners would not believe him, for that in this
trouble they had continued four months, and also that there were dead of
their fellows, thirty persons: so that there were so few of them remaining,
A woeful mortality
that there was not to every ship sixteen persons left to govern the same:
and of them there were some, that were very sick of the disease above said.
By this means they fell into such a desperation, by reason that they thought
they should go no further, and as they do affirm, that Paulo de la Gama,
and Nicholas Coello, being both of them Captains made agreement each of them
in their Ships to the other, that if so be that there would come any
Wind, by the which they might return into the Indias, that then they would
surely do so.

Being thus determined, upon a sudden there came a fresh gale of Wind, with
the which the Fleet might go forward, and with the same in sixteen days
they came within sight of land, being on a Wednesday the second of
Februarye: at the which the Mariners rejoiced in such sort that by means of
the same, they had forgotten their troubles and dangers that they were past,
and gave unto God great thanks for all his gracious benefits.

And when that they had sight of the Land, they found themselves so near
unto it, that the Captain general gave commandment to cast about into the
Sea, so much as might be thought sufficient for to stay until the morning,
the which being come, they went forthwith for to reknowledge the Land, and
for to see where they were, for that as now there was none that knew the same,
although that one of the Moors said, that they had then taken their Course
directlye toward Monsanbique, which stands between certain Islands,
standing over against them, three hundred leagues of the shore, whereas the
people of the same Country are continually sick of the same disease, that our
men were. The morning being come he went to reknowledge the land, and came
before a goodly great City, which was walled round about and within the same,
very fair and high houses, and in the midst of the same there was a great
Pallaice, which stood very high, and seemed to be of a goodly building, all
this they saw very well out of their ships. This City is called Magadoxo, The
City of Magadoxo.
which stands at the end of the said goulfe in the Coast of Aethiopia, a
hundred and thirteen leagues from Mylynde, the situation whereof I shall
declare hereafter. And for that the Captain general knew the same to be a
City of Moors, when as he went along the Coast, he commanded to shoot of
many pieces of Ordinance, and also for that he could not tell how far he
was from Mylynde, from thence forward he stayed in the night, because he would
not pass the same. Forthwith, on Saturday being the fifth of February, lieng
over against a village of the Moors, which they call Pate, being a hundred and
three leagues from Magadoxo, there came from thence eight Terradas which is a
certain kind of Boats of that Country, being all full of Soldiers, and
made their way straight toward our Fleet, fromwhence we shot so many pieces
of Ordinance, that they thought themselves happy to have escaped by running
away. Howbeit our men did not follow them for lack of wind. The next
Mundaye following, the General arrived at Mylynde, and being there, the King
sent to visit the Captain General with sundry fresh victuals, sending him
word also, how glad he was of his coming. The General answered him again,
by Fernan Martines, by whom he sent him a Present: and for because of those
that were sick, whom he was desirous to have cured, he tarryed there five
days, in the which time, there died of them many. At this present by the kings
license, he caused to be set a land a mark, in token of friendship. And after
that he had provided himself of victuals, he departed on a wednesday in the
morning, being the xvii. of February, with an Ambassador whom the king did
send, to the king of Portingale, for a perpetual confirmation of friendship
between them.

Of the death of the Captain Generals brother, and of the burning of one of
the ships called Saint Raphael, and also how he arrived in Portingale, and of
the honor the king gave him at their meeting. cap. 27.
NOw for that the Captain General had not men enough to govern the whole
Fleet, he thought good and that by the advice of the other Captains, to burn
one of those ships, and that the same should be Saint Raphael, which they
determined to do the rather, for so much as the same was al open, and they had
not brought him a ground as they did the others, and also determined to burn
the same upon the shoels of Saint Raphael, The Raphaell burned.
unto which place they came on the Sunday following, where (what for taking in
of her furniture, as also for burning the same) he spent five days, and during
that time from a village the which is called Tangata, there were brought to
sell many hens. This being done the Captain General departed, having with
him in his ship his brother called Paulo de la Gama, and on the.xx. of
February he found himself with only Nicholas Coello in the Island of
Zenziber, The I Will of Zenziber.
which stands in the altitude of six degrees, lieng but ten leagues from the
firm land. This Island is very great with the other two that stands near
unto it, whereof the one is called Pemba, and the other Mofya, and are very
fertile, and have in them great store of victuals. Their groves are of Orange
trees, which brings forth goodly Orenges. They are inhabited by Moors, which
are but a weak kind of people, and they have but small store of weapons,
howbeit they go very well apparelled, in silk and fine cloth made of Cotton,
the which they do buy in Mombassa, of Merchants of Cambayo. The women have
store of jewels of gold from Sofala, and of silver from the Island of Saint
Larence. They are merchants and their trade is in the firm land, and thither
they do carry victuals to sell in little boats. Each of these Islands has a king
of himself, the which also do observe Mahomets law as all the rest of the
subjects do.

As soon as the king of Zenziber heard that the Captain General was there
arrived, he sent to visit him and sent him great presents of the fruits of the
country, requesting him of his friendship, to the which he agreed. After all
this he departed on the first of March, and came to an Ankor before the Islands
of Saint George in Monsanbique, and the next day after he sent a mark to be
erected within that Island, where at his going thither he heard Mass, and
without any conversation with those of Monsanbique he departed. And on the
third of March he came to the Island of Saint Blase, where he stayed to take in
his water, and to victual himself of Sea woulfes, and of Solitarius, which
they salted to eat whilst they were on the sea, and for the same they gave
God great thanks. After that they were departed from thence (being once before
put back with westerly winds) which blew right against them, God of his
goodness sent them so prosperous a wind, that on the twentieth of March, they
had doubled the Cape of Buena Esperansa with great pleasure, for so much as all
those that came thither were all in health and very strong, and as they
thought were all in good liking to arrive at Lishborne.

And finding here a cold Wind which endured well twentye days, did set them
in a good forwardness toward the Island of Santiago, which by their Sea
cards was by the Pilots we known not to be at the uttermost a hundred leagues
from thence. Some there were that thought themselves to be with the same, but
it was not so.

Here that goodly and fair wind did fail them, and for so much as the
Captain General would needs know where that he was, (for that he could
not tell) by reason there fell certain showers which came from the landewarde,
he commanded to make as much way as they could possible. And going after
this sort, on Thursdaye being the xxv. of April, he commanded the Pilot to
let fall his Plommet, who found that they were in xxv. fathom.

Yet in all that day, sailing and keeping the self same course, the least
water that they came to, was at xx. fathom, and therefore the Pilottes judged
themselves to be upon the shoels Del zio Grands. All the rest of this voyage
perticularlye what adventures the Captain General did pass, until such time
as he came to the Island of Santiago, I could not come to the knowledge
thereof, but only how that as they went near to the same, Nicholas Coello to
carry the king news of this discovery, did on a certain night a part
himself from the Captain General, and followed his course unto Portingale,
where he arrived at a place called Cascais on the x. of July, in the year of
our Lord God. 1499. who informed the king of all that the Captain General
had past in the discovery of the Indias, and of the commodytyes that he had
brought with him from thence. Of whose discovery the king was so glad to
hear of, and that they might trade into the Indias by sea, as when he was
proclaimed king of the kingdoms of Portingale. Now after that the Captain
General found missing Nicholas Coello he went forward on his course toward
the Island of Santiago, for because his Brother was very sick of a Tyssicke,
and also for that his Ship made but small way, for that she was all open,
and therefore he did freight there a Caruell which he found there for to
carrye him to Portingale before that he should dye, who left there John de Sala
for Captain of his ship as I said before, who as soon as the ship was new
rigged, had charge to bring the same to Portingale, from the which place the
General departed, with his brother in the Caruell, whose infirmity did daily
increase, in such sort that the Captain General was driven to bear with the
Island of the Terceras. And being there arrived, commanded that his brother
might be brought a land, where he was so cruellye handled with his disease
that he dyed thereof, who at his end showed himself to be a good and perfect
christian, and a very honest Gentleman. After that he was dead and buried, the
Captain General departed toward Portingale, who came to Belen in the month
of September, in the self same year. 1499. being two year and two months past
after his departure from Lishborne, with 108. men and of them came back but
fifty alive, which considering their great travail and trouble that they had
past, was very much. After that the Captain General had given God great
thanks for that he had escaped so many great dangers, he sent word of his
arrival unto the king of Portigale, who for the great pleasure that he
received of his coming sent Don Diego de la Silua de Menesis, Lord of
Portugalete, with many other Gentlemen to receive him as they did, and brought
him unto ye court with an exceeding great number of people, that came thither to
see so new and rare a matter, as that was of ye Captain General, not only for
that he had done, but also for that they took him for dead: being come to
the kings presence, his highness gave him so great an honor as such a one
deserved, who by the discovery of the Indias, did give so great a glory unto
the eternal God, and honor and profit to the crown and kingdom of
Portingale, and a perpetual fame to all the world. Afterward he made him
knight, and to him and to his heirs for ever he gave for arms the royal arms
of Portingal, and also to set at the foot of the Scutchin two Does the which
they call Gamas. Also he gave him toward this his living three hundred
thousand Ceis a year, the which may be worth of our money 200. pound a year,
and this to be paid out of the tiths of the fish in the village of Sinis.
Moreover he promised him to make him Lord of the said village, for so much as he
was borne there. And until such time that he could give him ye same, he
allowed him a thousand crowns a year, the which he did well perform, from
that time forward, and after that he had received the possession thereof, he
did pass it over unto the house appointed, for the contraction of the Indias.
Moreover he granted him that after the trade of the Indias was setteled or
established, that then he might lade for his own account to the sum of. 200.
Ducats in spices, and that without paieng for the same any custom at all.
Also he gave him other possessions and rents and a bill of remembrance to make
him Lord. As for Nicholas Coello, he made him a Gentleman of his house, and
gave him possessions, and did allow him some recompense toward his charges.
The king himself with this new discovery did increase his titles with a new
and a famous style, of Lord of the conquest and navigations of Aethiopia,
Arabia, Persia, and of the Indias.

How the king of Portingale did nominate A Pedro al Verez Cabral for Captain
General of a Fleet toward Calicut, for to settle there a factorie, and of
his departure from Lishborne. Chap. 28.
BEing certainlye known to the king of Portingale, The preparation unto ye
second voyage.
that from his kingdom there is a navigations to the Indias, and also of the
innumerable riches, that there are in those parts among the Gentiles, sundry
Christians, did therefore determine to prosecute and follow the discouerye of
the same, giving all praise and land unto the eternal God, for his great
benefits that he has bestowed upon him, to let him be the first that has
discovered this new world, the which has always been so close upon the Sea,
that there has been none in all Europe that durst adventure that way. But
he not remembering the trouble of his spirit, neither yet the spending of his
treasure, nor the danger of his subjects, would nevertheless take this most
famous enterprise in hand, for that there might be in the Indias publyshed
the Evangelical law, to the end that those kind of lost people, might
receive the same, as also for the increasing, not only of his own treasure,
but generallye the benefit of all his subjects.

And that the same might take the better effect, he determined to give the
attempt (if it were possible) to settle a Factorye in Calycut by gentleness,
for as he once understood that the dwellers in the same were inclined to
trade, he thought that after this sort there would grow between them and us
conversation, and so a friendship, the which might be an occasion that they
would incline themselves to hear the word of God preached. And being thus
fullye determined, he commanded to be in a readiness against the next year
following, a Fleet of ten ships and two Caruells, which should go well
laden with all such things as Vasco de la Gama should inform him to be
spent in Calycut. Also there went others toward Sofala and Quyloa, where also
he commanded certain Factoryes to be setteled, not only for the gold
which they have there, but also that their ships might always touch there.
And concerning such as should be appointed for Calycut, The names of the
Generals Captains, and Factors.
he named for Captain General of this Fleet, a Gentleman called Pedro Aluares
Cabral, who came of an honorable house of the Cabralls, and for his petty
Captain, a Gentleman called Sancho de Toar. The names of the other Captains
as many as I knew were these, Nicholas Coello, Don Luis continuo, Simon de
Myseranda, Simon Leyton, Bartholome Dyas, who discovered the Cape Bu^na
Esperansa, Dyego Dyas, his brother, yt which went before for purser with Vasco
de la Gama. Those that were Captains of ye Caruels were one Pedro de Taide, and
Vasco de la Siluera, and for Factor of the whole Fleet, was one Aries Correa,
who likewise should remain for Factor in Calycut, and for his clerks there
were appointed one named Gonsalo Gyl Barbasa, and Pedro vas Caninon. Of this
Fleet there should remain and stay with the Merchants and Merchaundise in
Sofala two ships, and with the same should contineu for Factor one called
Loriso Hurdato. In this Fleet there went. 1500. men. The Articles which the
Captain General carried in his instructions, besides those of the settling of
the Factory was, yt if so he yt the king of Calycut would not quietly consent,
or give sufficient lading, for those ships which he carried nor consent to have
the factorie settled there: That then he should make him most cruel war, for
the injury which he showed unto Vasco de la Gama. And if so be that the
Factorie might be quietly settled, then he should request the king in secret
that he do not consent in Calycut, or in any other of his harbors belonging
to his kingdom, any of the Moors of Meca to remain there, for so much as he
would send him from hence forth all such Merchaundise as they do bring, and
that far better cheap then they do sell the same. Moreover, that in their
way they do touch at Milinde to set there a land the Ambassador, which Vasco
de la Gama brought from thence, and to send the king a present. Also the king
did send with the Fleet five Friars of the order of Saint Fraunces, of whom
went for Vicar, a Friar called Fraij Henrique, the which was afterward Bishop
of Siebta, Friars sent to the Malabars.
and he to remain in the Factorie, to preach the Catholic faith unto the
Malabars.

The Fleet being dispatched, the king in person on Sunday being the.viii. of
March went to hear Mass at the Monastery of Belem, going thither in
Procession, having the Captain General, the which heard Mass with him,
within the curten, for on that sort, he meant to give honor to such as did
serve him in such dangerous affairs as this was.

The Mass was said after the Portingale order, and at the same there was a
Sermon made by Don Diego Ortis, who was then Bishop of Vyse^, who gave great
praise unto the Captain General for accepting the said voyage at the kings
hands, since that thereby he did not only serve the king, who is his temporal
Lord, but also the eternal God, who is spiritual. And also that every one
might well know that none of all the nobles, the which are so highlye commended
as well in the Grecian histories as in the Latin and barbarous, was equal
unto the Captain General in taking upon him this voyage. And further he gave
him other great praises for the which he was enuyed at, the Mass being
ended, there was a Banner which had the royal arms of Portingale, upon the
same delivered unto the Bishop, who after that he had blessed the same, the
king with his own hand did deliver it unto the Captain General, for to
bestow it in his maine top. And after that he had received the same, A
jewel of great price.
he took at the Bishops hands a bonnet or night cap the which the Pope had
blessed, and sent for a great jewel, and with his own hands did put the same on
the Captain Generals head, saying that he did present unto him a jewel the
which he did much esteem. And afterward that the Bishop had given him his
blessing, the king with the same did accompany him to the water side, where
the Captain general with all the Captains of the fleet took their leave of
the king, and did kiss his hands, and the king gave them Gods blessing and
his, with the which they went all a boorde, from whence they shot off all the
ordinance that was in the Fleet, the which made a wonderful noise. The king
being returned to Lishborne, for that the Fleet could not that day depart,
by reason of the weather. The next day which was the ninth of March, in the
year of our Lord. 1500. having a sufficient good gale of wind, with the
which the Fleet might go out of the River. The Captain General did then
make a sign that the rest of the Fleet should weye their Ankors, the which
immediatlye they did begin with great diligence and triumph that the Mariners
made. And when it was eight of the clock in y^ morning the whole Fleet having
wayed, did then begin to cut and spread their sails with a great pleasure, and
cry saying altogether, Buen viage, that is to say, A luckie and prosperous
voyage. After all this they began all to be joyful, every man to use his
several office, the Governor in the midst of the ship, haling the maine
sheets, with the Capsteine. The Mariners and ship boys, some in the
forecastell haling bollings, braces, and Martnets: other belying the sheets
both great and small, and also serving in trimming the sails, and others the
nettings and foretop sails, other some vering the trusses and also beleying
brases and top sails sheets, and coyling every sort of ropes. It was
wonderful to see such a number of diversities of offices, in so small a room,
as is the breadth and length of a ship. All the Fleet being under sail,
departed that day without any stay by a quarter wind, and being with the
same under sail, on the xiiij. of March, they came within the sight of the
Canar^as, and on the xxij. of the same month, they past by the Island called
Santiago, and on the xxiiii. of the same month, they lost the company of one
of their ships, of the which went for Captain one Vasco de Tayde, who was
Captain of the Fleet also, although he never declared the same, the which
never after was seen.

How the Captain general came unto Brasill, and afterward how there was lost
four ships of the Fleet. Chap. 29.
THis ship being thus gone, the Captain general tarried for the same two
days, and on the xxiiii. of April they did des^ry land, of the which they
were very glad, not only for that they had discovered the same, but because
that the Pilots supposed the same to be some other land, that Vasco de la Gama
had not discovered, for that it stood to the East, and immediately the Captain
General commanded his Master to go in his small boat and to see what kind
of people were those that dwolt in the said Country, who returned with an
answer, saying, that the same land was a goodly fair and fertile Country,
in the which there were great store of words, and that there walked many men
along the water sides with this news, the Captain general came to an Ankor,
and sent once more his Master with great dilygence to inform himself of the
Country and of their dwellings, and found that the people were of color
somewhat black, and men well proportioned, howbeit they went all naked, having
both bows and arrows. But when night was come, there fell so great a storm
that the Captain general with all the rest of the Fleet, were feign to wey
their Ankors, and run along the Coast, until such time as they found a good
Port, in the which they came to an Ankor, unto the which the Captain general
did give for name, Puerto Seguro, for so much as the same served for all wethers.
Here our men took two men of that Countrry, the which went in an (...) who
were brought before the Captain general, that he might inform himself what
Country that was, which could not be known notwithstanding, for so much as there
was none in all the fleet that could understand them, by any tokens or signs.
The Captain general seeing yt there was no means for to inform himself by
the^, commanding to give them apparel, yt the others might be desirous to
bring the^ victuals to sell, with other things which they had in their country,
and with this they went their way, with great joy of yt Captain generals gift.
And when they were come a land amongst their companions, and they perceived
their good entertainment, did adventure to come to confer with our men. The
Captain general finding himself indifferently in this country, did determine
to take in fresh water to comfort his men wtall, for yt he knew not when he
should chance with like opportunity. And for yt God might ye rather and the^, he
commanded on ye next day, which was on Easter week, a Mass should be said a
land, yt which was so done with great solemnity and that under a pauillion, in
which there was made a Sermon by Fraij Henrique, Doctor of Divinity. And
whilst y^ divine service was a celebrating, there assembled many of ye country
people together, which showed themselves to be very merry with plaieng and
leaping which they made, besides their sounding upon cornets, horns, and other
instruments. After Mass was ended, and that ye Captain general was going a
ship board, these people went with him until he took his boat, singing and
making a thousand manner of pastimes: this day after dinner, y^ Captain
general gave our men license to go a land to buy and sell with them, which they
did, and in truck of paper and cloth, they gave them parrats, and other sundry
sort of birds, which were all very fair, whereof they have great abundance,
Ornaments made of Parrats feathers.
with the which they make fethered hats and night caps, which are very gallant.
Some of our men yt went to see their towns do declare ye the same is a goodly
country and fertile of woods, with great store of goodly waters, and plenty of
fruits, and that there is gathered in ye same great quantity of cotton. The
country of Brasil discovered
And for yt this country is yt which we call Brasil, which to all men is common,
I will not speak of y^ same further, but only yt in viii. days that y^
Captain general staid there, was seen a fish which ye sea did cast a land, yt
was greater then any Tonel, and of ye breadth of two of the^, howbeit he was
round: y^ head and eyes were much like unto a hogs, his cares like unto an
Elephants, he had no teeth, but under his belly he had two issues, his tail
was three quarters of a yard in breadth, and as much in length, his skin, was
like unto a Hogs skin, which was a finger thick. In this Island the
Captain general commanded to be erected a high Cross of stone, and therefore
he gave the same to name La tierra de Santa Crus. From hence he sent a Caruell
which he brought forth with him for the same purpose, with letters unto the
King his Lord, of all that which had chanced him unto this place, and how
that he had left there two bannished men of those twenty, the which he carried
with him, to the end they might better inform themselves what Country that
same was, and whether it were a firm land, as it did appear unto them, all,
by the great distance of the Coast that they had found, and because of the
great voyage which he had taken in hand to make, he could not send to know
perfectly. With this Caruel he sent a man of that Country for a show, by what
kind of people the same was inhabited. This Caruell being departed, the next
day after being the second day of May, the Captain general departed with all
his Fleet, bearing his course toward the Cape Buena espe^ansa, the which was
from thence almost 1200. leagues, which is a great and fearful gulf to pass,
by reason of the great winds which do course in those parts, most of the
time. And being under sail in the same, on the xii. of May there appeared in
the Element a great Comet with her beams, A Comet seen in the eleme^t
the which came out of the Orient, and for the space of x. days did always
appear as well in the night as in the day, always enlarging his beams. On
Saturday being the xxiii. of May, there came amongst all the Fleet such a
storm from the Northeast, that all the Fleet was feign to take in their
sails, having the Seas very high mingled with pretty showers of rain And for
that the same storm was afterward somewhat abated, they brought themselves
under their forefailes again, and at night the wind being altogether calm,
such ships as were left behind, did spread out also their sprit sail, to
overtake those yt went before. And going by after winds, and following their
course by the South, the Sunday being the xxiiii. of May, the wind began to
increase, which was the occasion that the Captain general commanded their
sails to be taken in, and to fardle up their sprits sails, the which being
done, the like did all the other Captains, and going on this sort on Sunday,
between x. and xi. of the clock of the day, did begin to ariue in the
Northwest a spowte, with the which the wind calmed in such sort, that the
sails did beat against the Mast, and the Pilots being (not as yet acquainted
with the secret signification of a spowte) for that they had not trauayled
those Seas, thought the same to be a sign of fair weather, and of great
calmes: by reason whereof, they never made any kind of alteration in any
thing, appertaining to their sails. Upon this on a Sundaye, there came such a
wind and so furious, that then they had no time to amayne and take in their
sails, by reason whereof, there were four Ships sunk without escaping one
person of them all, four ships sunk by tempest,
and of one of these was Captain one Bartholomew Dias. The other seven
remained half full of water, which they had taken in, which likewise had
sunk, if so be that part of their sails had not been torn.

And after that the wind verred to the Southwest they bare with the same, the
which was so great that they were driven to roue all that day and the next
night following without sails, so that the one could not see the other, and
howsoever as yet the return of any other wind was not come, they were driven
to such danger that they thought thereby they should loose their lives,
for so much as the rest of the Fleet was so cast away before their eyes,
wherewith they were stricken into a very great pensiveness. The next day the
wind being somewhat incalmed, with the same the Fleet did join themselves
together again, and immediately after, the wind came to the East and
Northeast, which was so great that it made the Seas to go higher then ever
they did before, A vvo^derful storm and great Seas.
and so the same endured the space of xx. days: and all this time the ships
lay a hull, although they proved five times to hoyse up their sails, as
aforesaid. Now the Seas went so high to all their judgments, they thought it
impossible for the ships to escape: for over and besides that, by the working
of them it was thought, that sometime they did hoyse up their ships above the
Element, and other times when the ships began to descend, they fell as it
were down a monstrous hill, that they feared they should be all swallowed up
in the Intralles of the Earth.

In the day the water was of the color of pitch, and in the night of fire.
The tackling with the other furniture of the Ships, with the great force of
the wind, made such a terrible noise, and was so fearful to hear, that the
same is incredible to be believed, but by those only that endured and passed
the same, with the force of this, the Fleet was separated into sundry places.
The Captain General bare up with Simon de Myranda, and Pedro de Tayde,
whether the wind would carry them: all the others went at Gods mercy.

Of the meeting of the King of Quiloa and the Captain general, at which time
there was set down a Trade and Factorie, and how the King repented himself of
the same afterward. Cap. 30.
AFter that the Captain General had past with part of his Fleet, these
great storms did find himself to have doubled the Cape, without any sight
of the same, having in his company no more then two Ships, which bare always
up with him. And the Lord having used always toward them his wonderful
great mercy, he came within sight of the land the sixteenth day of July,
toward the which he commanded to bear, howbeit the Pilots did not know the
same, notwithstanding they found that it stood in the altitude of xxvii.
degrees, they were so near unto land, that the Ships lay with their beak
heads close to the same. But the Captain general would not consent that any
of his men should go a land: yet from their ships they might easilye
perceive, that the same was well inhabited, for the great number of people they
did see there, and yet of all those there came none to the water side, to see
what we were.

After that he saw that there was no hope to have any refreshing from thence,
he did afterward procure the same from the Sea, where there was great plenty
of fish, where our men was driven to fish for it. Afterward the Captain
general commanded to weye their Ankors, and to follow his course, so near
unto the shore, that he might well see great numbers and store of sundry
beasts, which fed along the River, that entered into the Sea, and also they
saw many people.

Now going on that sort, They come to Sofala
the Captain general did pass unto Sofala, with the which as yet the Pilot
was not acquainted, and being near to the same, he saw two Islands and right
over against one of them there was riding at an Ankor two Ships, which as
soon as they had discovered our Fleet, did begin to fly away toward the
shore. And for that the Captain general saw that they fiedde, he commanded
to follow them, which was done in such sort that our men did overtake them,
and took some of them prisoners, for that they did not defend themselves, and
concerning the chiefest person that was in these Ships, the Captain General
was advertised that he was the King of Mylyndes near kinsman, and was going
from Sofala laden with Gold to Mylynde. Who confessed, that when they had
descryed our Ships, they received such a fear, as though they should be
taken, and that therefore they did throw the most part of their Gold into the
Sea, and they themselves ran a land.

After that all this was done, ye Captain general told him that he was very
sorry for their so great mischance and loss, in especially for so much as the
King of Mylynde was in so great a credit with the King of Portingale his
Master, which is the occasion, that all Portingales are and shall be always
at his commandment. And having showed unto him great courtesy, he commanded
the Ships to be returned with all the gold they had found in the same.

The Moore asked of him whether he had brought with him any Witches, that they
might with words of enchantment fetch up such gold as was thrown into the
Sea. To whom the Captain general made answer, that the Christians do
believe in the true God, who has and does defend them so, that they do not
use nor believe in witchcraft, and therefore they do not use the same. Of this
Moore the Captain general was advertised, that he had somewhat over run
Sofala, and for that he would not return back, he did at this time leave it,
and having dispatched the Moore, followed his course, and on the xx. of July
arrived at Monsanbique, where he took in his water, and a Pilot to carry him
to the Island of Quiloa, toward the which he directed his course, running along
the Coast. In this his voyage he saw sundry profitable Islands which were
belonging to the King of Quiloa, The king of Quiloa a mighty Prince.
which as I have declared is a great Prince, and is Lord from the Cape De las
correntes, almost unto Mombassa, ye which is welneere four hundred leagues of
Coast, in the which there do enter the two Islands that I have spoken of
before, over and besides Sofala, and other sundry Towns unto Monsanbique, and
from thence as many more unto Mombassa, with an infinite number of Islands, that
does yield him great rents. Notwithstanding as touching his estate it is but
small, for he is not able to make many men of war: his abode is always in
Quiloa, in a certain Island, which is a hundred leagues beyond. Monsanbique
in the Coast of Aethiopia, near to the firm land, the which is very fertile
of Orchardes, and Woods, that bear sundry sorts of fruits, there are
excellent good waters, and also they do ripe great store of Miso, and other
seeds which they do sow, and there is bred up in the same great store of
small Cattle. In those Seas there is great plenty of Fish, and that very
good. So that what with the victuals that they have in the land, and what
there comes from other places of the firm land, The description of the city
of Quyloa.
the City is plentifully provided, which city is compassed about with fair
gardens on the one side, and with the sea on the other, which causes the same
to show very pleasant, it stands in ix. degrees to the South, and is also
great and full of people. Their houses are made of lime and stone, in the
which there are goodly chambers. Their king is a Moore, and so are the
inhabitants, the natural people of the Country are a kind of black people,
and those that are strangers are white, their common language is Algarauia.
They do apparel themselves very richly, in especial the women, for they
carry always upon them great store of jewels of gold. They are great
Merchants, for their trade is of the gold that comes from Sofala, and from
this city it is dispearsed to all the Country of Arabia Felix, and other
places, and therefore there resort thither many merchaunts from other places.
There are always in this port many ships which lies always a ground when they
have no need of the^. Ships without nails.
These ships have no nails, but are sowed together with ropes made of Cairo, and
pitched over with wildincense, for because as in all yt country there is no
other kind of pitch. The winter in this country does begin in April, and
makes an end in September. The Captain General being come to the harbor of
this City, and having obtained of the king a safe conduct that he might send
him a messenger, did send unto him Alonso Hurtado, who went accompanied with
seven of the principals of their ships, and that they might show themselves in
more countenance and authority, they went in their best apparel. Being come
before the king, he represented unto him the message which the Captain
General gave him, which was to signify unto him yt he was come thither with
ye king of Portingale his Masters fleet, to settle a trade in ye city, and
to the same end had brought with him great store of merchandise y^ were
convenient to be spent in y^ country, and therefore he was desirous to talk with
him therein, howbeit ye king his master did countermand him yt in any wise he
should not leap a land, but make the agreement a sea board, forasmuch as that is
the ancient custom which the Captains do always observe in his country,
because yt if so be there should chance any misfortu^e to their general, which is
their head, immediately are cast away the rest that are under his government. To
this the king made answer with a good countenance, yt he was also desirous to
see the Captain General, and to speak with him a sea board, since there was
no other remedy, Alonso Hurtado having received this answer, made ye Captain
General privy thereof, who ye next day after tarryed for ye king in his boat,
which was covered over and set out with flags. There did attend upon him all the
rest of ye Captains in their boats, and at this present arrived there, Sancho
de Toar with other two ships. The king thus being looked for, at the length he
came in an Almadia, being well accompanied with sundry Gentlemen in other
boats, likewise furnished, which also were set out with flags, and had in them
those that sounded upon trumpets and cornets, and Sagbuts, which made a
wonderful great noise. Now the king being come where the Captain General was
tarrieng for him, all his ordinance went of in such sort and with such a force,
that it made the sea to tremble, wherewith the king and all his train,
for so much as they were not accustomed unto the same, The meeting of ye king and
ye Captain General.
were greatly afeard. As soon as the ordinance went of, the king and the
Captain General met, and that with great pleasure. And after that the king of
Portingales letter was read, which was for y^ settling of a trade in his city,
he answered that he was contented therewith, and did agree that the next day he
should send Alonso Hurtado a land, to tell him the sorts of the merchaundise
that he had brought with him, and he would give him gold for ye same. Upon this
agreement Alonso Hurtado was sent a land the next day following, howbeit he
found the king far from ye which was agreed upon with ye captain general ye day
before, yelding therefore sundry excuses, A malicious and ferfull More*
why he could not accomplish his promise, in especial for yt he han no need of
his merchandise, and also for yt he believed that ye Captain general came
thither to take his country from him. This sodeine chance was for this cause,
for so much as he was a Moore, and we were christians, it grieved him to have
any conversation or trade with us. This being come to ye Captain generals
knowledge, he did as yet tarrye three or four days, to see whether y^ the
king would change any thing of his determination or not, howbeit he did nothing
alter his mind, but rather had our men in jealousy, fearing least that he
should be driven to do y^ by force, which he was loath to do, and therefore did
fortify himself with many men in a readiness. As soon as the Captain
General heard of his dealing, he would spend no more time there, but departed
toward Milinde, keeping always along the coast.

How the king of Milinde and the Captain General met together, and how he
departed afterward toward Calicut. Chap. 31.
ON the second day of August, he came to an ankor in the port of Mylinde, where
he found riding at an ankor three ships of ye Moors ye which were of yt
Merchannts of the kingdom of Cambaya, but he would not meddle with them,
although they were laden with great riches, because of ye king of Milinde. Being
come with all his fleet to an ankor, he saluted ye city with all his ordinance.
The king with this sent to visit him, sending also unto him for a present, both
sheep, ducks, and hens, without all number, besides sundry sorts of fruits. Then
y^ Captain general sent likewise to kiss his hands, by one of his fleet, and
also to signify unto him, yt thither he was come by his Master ye king of
Portingales commandment, to know whether he had any need of this fleet to do
him service wtall, and also to certify him, y^ he had to deliver unto him a
rich present, with a letter, the which ye King his master had likewise sent
unto him, which he would send whensoever he would command ye same, with this
message ye king showed himself to be well pleased, and commanded the messenger
to remain with him that night, with whom he talked and spent most part thereof
in matters of Portingale. And as soon as it was day the king sent by two
principal Moors word unto the Captain General, The kings message to ye
Captain General.
that he was very glad of his coming, and also to know whether he had need
of any thing in his country which he might command as his own, and make as
much account thereof, while he was there, as if he were in Portingale,
considering the great good will which he does owe unto the king of
Portingale, and that in all his affairs he should make as much reckoning as of
his own home. The Captain General having well understood the kings message,
upon the same determined to send him the kings letter, which he had brought,
and also the present, which was all the furniture of a Iennet horse, which was
also both rich and gallant. And having taken his counsel upon ye same, it was
agreed upon to send it, and that Aries Correa should have the carriage thereof,
for so much as he was the factor of the whole Fleet, and also for that he went
for Factor to the king of Calicut, and that he should so go accompanied with
the principalls of the Fleet, besides the trumpetors, that should go always
sounding before him, which was so done. The king being informed of ye coming
of Aries Correa, sent of the nobles of his Court to receive him, which might
the more easilye be done, for that the kings pallaice was hard by the water
side, and going altogether, there were certain women which by the kings
commandment were tarryeng for their coming, with perfuming pans in their
hands, out of the which there came so excellent a perfume, that it did
replenish the whole earth therewith And passing after this sort by these
women, he came to the kings pallaice, who was sitting in his chair of estate,
and accompanied with many noble me^ and Gentlemen, who also received Aries
Correa with great honor and pleasure, and also the present. Afterward he gave
him the letter which was written on both sides, on the one side was Portingale,
the other in the Arabian tongue, which the king commanded forthwith to be read,
which both he and all the nobility were very glad to hear. And all they
together with a loud voice gave God and Mahoma great thanks that they had
permitted them to have friendship with so great a Prince as ye king of
Portingale. And also being very well pleased with the furniture of the Ienet, he
requested Aries Correa to stay with him, whilst the Fleet did there remain,
which with the Captain Generals license he did, and during the three days
that he was with him, almost he spent his time in no other thing, but to know
the use and custom of the king of Portingale, and of the order of his
government, and also perticularly as though yt he did remember no other matter
all y^ time, and being desirous to see ye Captain general, did procure with as
much diligence as he could to have him a land, and to bring him to his
pallaice, notwithstanding he made his excuse, saying, yt the king his master
had commanded him not to come a land in any port, with this answer ye king was
driven to encounter with him upon the water, who would needs go as far as ye
water side on horsback, with y^ furniture of a Ienet yt the king of Portingale
had sent him. And for yt in his country he had none yt could tell ye order
thereof, he requested one of our men to do so much. And when the king had all
things in a redines, there were tarrieng for him certain of ye principals, at ye
foot of a staire, and amongst them there was brought a live sheep, which whilst
ye king was coming down, they did open as he was alive, and after yt they had
taken out his guts and bowels, they laid y^ same under ye horse feet. The king
being now on horsbacke he went also with his horse upon ye sheep, (...)
which is a kind of ceremony y^ the witches there do use. After yt he had thus
trodden upon the sheep, he went toward ye water side, with all his company
after him a foot, saying with a loud voice certain words of witchcraft. And after
this sort he met with the Captain General upon ye water, where he delivered
him a Pilot to carry him to Calycut. Here there were left with the king two
of those banished men that they might inform themselves of the country, as
far as in their strength, one of those was called afterward Machado, who
after that he had gotten the Arabian language, went by land unto the
straights, and from thence unto the kingdom of Cambaya, from whence he did
pass to Balagarte, and did there settle himself, with the Sabayo, that was
Lord of Goa, saying, that he was a Moore, and for the same, he was taken in
all that Country, this his travel was very profitable to Alonso de
Albu^querque, as you shall perceive hereafter.

How the Captain General arrived at Calycut, and how the king sent to visit
him a board his ship, and also how afterward he came a land for to see him, and
of his receiving there. Cap. 22.
THe Captain General being returned to his ships, departed toward Calycut,
being the 7. day of August, and on the 20. he came to Ansadina, where he stayed
certain days for the coming of the ships of Meca, with intent to set upon
the^ if so be yt they came thither. And whilst they were there, they did
confess themselves, and afterward did receive the Sacrament, And they seeing
that there came no ships, departed toward Calycut, and on the 13. of September
he came to an ankor within a league of the same. And immediately there came
certain Almadias toward our fleet, The king of Calycuts message to ye
Captain General.
to sell victuals, and also there came certain Nayres of ye most principal
belonging to y^ king of Calicut, with a certain Guzarate merchant, by whom ye
king sent word unto ye Captain General, y^ there could not have happened a
better thing unto him then to understand yt he was come unto his port, and that
he could not do him no better pleasure the^ to command him, if there were any
thing in his city yt he had need of, and he would accomplish ye same with
great good will: whereunto y^ Captain general made answer with great thanks,
and seeing with what good will y^ king sent to visit him, he brought himself to
an ankor near unto ye city, always shooting of his ordinance, with ye which
he did salute the^, which was so great a wonder to the dwellers, that those
that were Gentiles said, that against us there were no resistaunce. The next
day following by the consent of the Captains of the Fleet, the Captain
General sent by one whose name was Gaspar, to demand a safe conduct of the
king for to send a messenger unto him, sending also with the said Gaspar those
four Malabars that Don Vasco de la gama had carried from Calicut. These went
all apparelled in a gallant sort, after the Portingales order, whom all the
city came forth to see, who meruailed to behold them to return so well,
which was the cause that they were so well pleased with our men, and that they
were had in so great reputation. But for so much as these were but fisher men the
king would not see the^, although he was glad to understand after what sort
they returned, and commanded yt the said Gaspar should be brought before him,
whom he received very well. And after that he knew wherefore he came, answered
him, that whosoever of our men would come a land, might without any fear at
all. This answer being come to ye Captain Generals ears, he sent presently
unto the king Alonso Hurtado, to signify unto him yt the said fleet belonged
to the king of Portingale, of the which he went for Captain General, and that
his coming thither was for no other purpose but only to settle with him a trade
and friendship, for the which it was convenient for him, to talk with him.
Howbeit he said, the king his Master had commanded him, that he should
not do it, without he might for the assurance of his person, receive some
pledges to remain in the ships whilst he was a land with the king, and
that the one of those pleadges should be the Catuall of Calicut, The king of
Calicut makes excuses when he should deliver pledges
and Araxamenoca, the which is one of the principallest Nayres: And another
there went with Alonso Hurtado, one that could speak the language, which
should declare unto the king the effect of the message.

The king being hereof informed meruailed much to hear that the Captain
general did demand those pledges, which he did excuse to give, for so much as
they were sickly and old, howbeit he said he would give others that could
better abide the brannesse of the sea. But afterward he did insist very much,
not to give any pleadges at all, for so much as those that were Moors were very
sorry to see our men in Calycut, and gave the king counsel to send none, for
that in giving of any he might well judge therein y^ the Captain General had
but little confidence in him, and by this means he should remain dishonored.
Yet for all this Alonso Hurtado did still insist in his demand. In this
encountrie they spent three days. At the end the king having a desire to have
a trade settled with ours, for the benefit that might redound unto him by the
same, did consent to Alonso Hurtado his request, in giving the pleadges that
were demanded, which being come to the Captain Generals knowledge, he began
to make himself in a readiness to go and speak with the king, and to
remain a land three or four days, apointing in his place Sancho de Toar, to
whom he gave commandment that there should be made for those pleadges at their
coming aboard good enterteinment, and to look well unto them, and not to
deliver them to any that should come to demand them, although they came in
his name.

On the xxviii. day of December the Captain General put himself in his best
apparel, and carried with him thirty of the principal men of his Fleet,
which should remain with him a land, with others that were the kings
servants, which should attend upon him as upon the kings own person. He
commanded also to be carried with him all the furniture for his Chamber and
Kitchen, with his Cupboorde of Plate, in the which there were many rich pieces
of silver gilted.

Now being with all these things in a readynesse to depart, there came from
the City sundry principal Nayres, which were commanded by the king to
attend upon the Captain General, accompanied with many men, besides others
that came sounding upon Trumpets, other upon Sackbuts and other instruments.
The Captain general being informed that the King was tarrieng for him in a
certain Galerie, which only for to receive him in, he had commanded to be
made hard by the water side, took his boat and went toward the shore, being
accompanied with all the other boats of ye Fleet, which went all in good
order, and set out with many flagges and trumpets, which being joined together
as well these as those that came from the City, made a wonderful noise. With
this came those pledges aboard the Generals ship, Pleadges are sent aboorde,
which fear to be taken captive.
into the which they were loath to enter, until such time that ye Captain
general did disimbarke himself a land, giving thereby to understand that they
were afeard that they being once aboard, he would return again into the
Fleet, and so take them for captives. They did stand so much upon the same,
that Aries Correa was feign to tell them, that without any suspicion they might
enter into the ship, for so much as the Captain general was not come thither
for to deceive the King, but only for to get his good will, with this they
were contented, to go aboorde, yet it was with some fear, that he would take
them captives. In the mean while that we were about this the Captain general
landed, where there was tarrieng for him sundry Caymales and Pymacales, and
other principal Nayres, being accompanied with many others. And before that
the Captain general could set his feet on the ground, he was taken up, and
put in an Andor or chair, in the which he was carried to the Serame,
accompanied with the multitude above said. Being come to this place, he
entered into a certain house where the King was, whom he found in this
order. The house was hanged over with Carpets, or as they call them Alcatifas,
at the end whereof, there was a certain place where the King was sitting, The
king of Calycuts state and furniture.
made much like unto a little Chapel, and over the Kings head did hang the
cloth of Estate, of unshorn Crimson velvet, and under him and about him, were
twenty cushions of silk. The King himself was all naked, saving that about
his middle he had a cloth made of Cotton, which was white as snow, and wrought
over with gold. On his head he had a night cap of cloth of gold, which was
made of the fashion of an head piece or skull. On his ears he had hanging
certain Iewelles, of Diamonds, Sapphires and Pearls, of the which there was two
bigger then Walnuts. On his arms from the elbow to the hand he had sundry
Bracelettes of Gold, in the which there were precious Sons, and that without
number, and of a wonderful valewe. Moreover on his legs from the knees
downward, and on the fingers of his hands, and the toes of his feet, and
especially on his great toe, there was a ring, in the which there was a Rubie
so great and fine, that it gave such a light as was wonderful: amongst al
which stones, there was a Diamond bigger then a great Bean. But all this was
nothing in comparison of his girdell, which was made of Gold and Stone that
the same was above all price, and out of it there came such a resplendour or
brightness, that it blinded men's eyes to look upon it.

There stood hard by him a Chair of Estate of gold and silver, wrought in
the best manner, full of precious stone, and of the self same sort was the
Andor in the which he was brought from his Pallaice, which also stood there,
Also there were twenty Trumpets, whereof seauenteene were of silver, and the
other three of gold, the mouths whereof, were finely wrought and set with
stone. Also there was a Basin of gold in the which he did spit, and certain
perfuming pans of silver, out of the which, there came an excellent smell. And
for estate sake there were lightened certain Lamps of Oil, which were after the
Moors order, the which were also made of silver. Six paces from the King,
stood his two brethren, which were heirs unto the Kingdom after him, and
somewhat further off stood many Noble men, they all standing upright upon
their feet.

Of the meeting of the Captain general, and the King of Calycut and how there
was delivered unto him the Kings present which he brought, and afterward what
happened. Chap. 23.
THe Captain general being entered into this place, and viewing the Kings
estate, would have gone to kiss the Kings hands, as it is commonly used
amongst us: but for that he was informed by those that stood by, that it was
not the use and custom amongst them, he did it not. Howbeit there was a Chair
appointed him that was hard by the Princes seat, in y^ which the Captain
general did sit, that from thence he might declare his mind to the King,
which was the greatest honor that he could give him. The Captain general
delivers his letters of credit to the king of Calicut
Being set down, he delivered his letter of credit, which he brought from the
King of Portingale, written in the Arabian tongue which being read by the
King, ye Captain general also told his message, the effect whereof was this,
That ye King of Portingale was desirous of his friendship, and to settle a
Factorie in Calycut, in the which there should be sufficient of all kind of
Merchandise that should be spent there, and in trucke of the same, or for ready
money, he requested that he would let him have sufficient lading of spices for
those ships there. The King showed himself to be content with this Embassage,
and answered the Captain general that he would yield the King of Portingale
out of his City, all that he should have need of. The present which ye
general brought with him*
While they two were in this talk, came thither the present which the Captain
general had brought, in the which were these pieces, a Basin of silver and gylt
wrought, a fountain to the same, a Cup with his cover gylt, of the same
work, two Masses of silver, four Cushions, two of them of cloth of gold,
and other two of Crimson Velvet unshorn, a Cloth of Estate of Gold, being
welted and guarded with the self same Gold, and of Crimson velvet a very fine
Carpet, two clothes of Arras, the which were very rich, the one with figures,
and the other with green works. Of this present, and of the Embassage which
the Captain general had done unto him, as it appeared, the King was very glad,
and told the Captain general that he might go to his lodging to rest
himself, or else to his ships as he would himself, for that he thought
necessary to send for his Pledges, which are Gentlemen and daintely brought up,
and could not away with the Sea, to tarry there longer. And whilst they were
there, he was assured, that they would neither eat nor drink for such was
their custom. And if fo be that the Captain general would go to his ships,
and come the next day again, to make full agreement and consent about the
order of the trade in Calicut, he would then send those Pledges again. The
Captain general having good confidence in those his words, went to his
ships, leaving behind him with his stuff, Alonso Hurtado with other seven.
And being at the water side ready to depart, a servant of one of those
Pleadges, went before aboard in a small Pinnace, and told them that the
Captain general did return aboorde, this messenger was sent by the
commandment of the Clearke and Controller of the Kings house, as who should
say, to give them counsel to come their way, which they did, as soon as
they heard what the slave had told them in their language, and with that they
leapt into the Sea, thinking to take that Pinace in the which the slave went.
As soon as Aries Correa saw this, he leapt into his own boat, which was
hard by the ships side with certain of his Mariners and rowing with force
took two of the Pledges, and also three or four of those that wore in the
Pinace, the other fled and carried the Catuall with them, which was also one of
the Pledges. This being concluded, the Captain general came aboard, who after
that he had known what had passed, because that those Pledges the which he had
in his custody, should not return and (...) their way, he commanded them to
be put under the hatches of his ship, and afterward sent to complain to the
King of that which they had done, laieng all the fault upon the Clarke
Controller. Also he sent word after what sort they remained in his ship,
promising, that if so be yt he would send him his stuff, and such of his men as
remained a land, he would immediately send those Pleadges which he had: and for
that it was night, there was no more at that time done. The next day
following, the King came to the water side, accompanied (...) xii. thousand
men, and sent with the Captain General^ stuff and men, to the number of
thirty Almadias, for that they might return with those Pledges that did
remain aboard, howbeit for all that they were so many, yet there durst none of
them come near the ships, for the fear they stood in of our men, which
remained in the Fleet, least they would take them, and so they returned with
the same again to land. The Captain General seeing the fear that they stood
in of his Fleet, sent the next day in certain of his own boats those
Pledges that he had in custody, commanding that they should go and see them
delivered somewhat aloof of from the fleet, that brought him his men and
stuff. And while they were delivering the same, Araxamenoca which was the
eldest of the Pledges, leaped into the water upon a sudden, with intent to
run away, but for all that he could not escape, for so much as our men caught
handefast of him. The other that remained, whilst our men were thus busied
fled likewise. The like did Alonfo Hurtado practice with five of those that were
with him. The Captain general meruailed to see how little honesty or truth
they used, did therefore command Araxameno^a to be well looked unto. And being
three days past, and yet the King not sending for him, he had pity to see
him that in so many days he had eaten nothing, Humai^^ pity in (...) Captain
general tovvard faithless Infidells*
and thereupon he sent him to the King, also he sent sundry weapons which were
taken of his men's, and requested him to send the other two of his men that were
yet a land, which the King did send, being moved thereunto, more for shame
then otherwise, for that he had broken his word and promise. Now being three
days past, and there came no kind of answer unto the Captain general,
thereby he had sufficient trial or understanding how variable he was, and
therefore he would tarrye no longer for his answer, but sent unto him to
know whether he would make an end of the agreement yt was begun between them,
and for the conclusion of the same he would send Aries Correa which came with
him for Factor. Howbeit for the better assurance thereof, he willed him to send
him certain Pledges. This message was sent (...) King by a certain Gentleman
called Francisco Correa, which did offer himself to carry the same, when all
the rest of the Fleet was afeard, least that the King would take him
prisoner, or command him to be slain. To this message ye king made answer yt
he was well pleased to agree to have the Trade settled, and that he should
send unto him Aries Correa about the same or whom else he should think good.
But first of all he told him that he would send two Nephews of one
Gosarate, The pledges sent aboard.
which is a great rich Merchaunt, for pledges, which indeed was so done. After
that those pledges were entered, immediately departed toward the land Aries
Correa, to whom the King commanded to be given a fair house to lie and rest
himself and to lay his Merchandise in, which he brought with him, which house
belonged to Gosarate, who was Grandfather to those two Pledges, that the king
had sent. But he commanded that forasmuch as Aries Correa, was yet not well
known in the Country nor acquainted with their orders and prices how he might
sell his Merchandise, nor yet what the buyer should give, to instruct him
therein. But he did not so, but rather clean contrary, forasmuch as he was a
friend to ye Moors of Meca, which were great enemies unto our men, not only
for that they were Christians, but for fear least that for our cause they
should loose part of there credit which they had in Calicut, by means whereof
they took their Merchandise for what price so ever they would themselves. And
also for the fear they conceived of them many times, the Gentiles durst not
come out of their doors.

They knew also that having our Factory setteled there, they should be great
loosers, not only in their Merchandise, which would be in value less worth,
as also in their ^^^^ces, Drugs and precious stones, which would be more worth
and better esteemed. And that was the cause that always. Aries Correa was
ouerthwarted in all things yt he went about to buy, with offering more then he
did for the same, after yt the price was by any of ours made, then ever they
did before, so yt by this means always he was forced to pay the deerer for
his drugs and spices. And if so be that at any time he would speak with ye
King, they did travel all yt they could, that some of them might be always
present to withstand and speak against him in all things. They did not this
only themselves, but found means also by Sam^cide, which was Admiral of the
Sea of Calicut, and a natural Moore, yt he should not consent yt those yt
remained in ye Factory with Aries Correa should go aboard ye Fleet, and moreover
if any ship would presume to come near to yt shore, not to consent yt it should
return, saying, The Captain general had good came to fear and hate the Moors
yt the King had given such commandment The Captain general being advertised
of all this, and supposing the same to be of a suspicion of treason, commanded
to wey and bring himself under sail to go out of that harbor, and there to
enter into council with his Captains what were best for him to do, for that
he was afeard lest whilst yt he remained in that harbor he might be set upon
by ye king of Calicuts Fleet, and so be troubled. The King after yr the knew
what the Captain general had done, and that he minded to go his way,
demanded of Aries Correa the cause why he went out of his harbor, who
answered him that he did not know certainly, wherefore without it were for the
injuries which the Moors had done unto him, and so told him ye whole order,
for that he knew the same. The King upon this willed him to send again for the
Captain general, who immediately after that he knew, what the king had said,
returned, and the King forthwith commanded that the Moors should not from
thenceforth use any such villainy. He also took away the Gosarate from the
company of Aries Correa, unto whom he gave charge to instruct him in the order
of the Country, and did put in his place another which was a very honest man,
and a friend of ours, (although he were a Moore) whose name was Cosebequin.
This man was also in Calicut of good credit, and the head of all the Moors of
the Country, that were naturally borne there, which were always in
controversy with the Moors of the Cayro, and of the Straights of Meca, of the
which the Admiral was head. Also the King gave commandment, that to the end
our Merchaunts which were in the Factorie might sell the better, and also buy
their Spices at the better hand, and with quietness, they should remove
their Factorie to a house of Cosebequin, A free house for the factory given to
the king of Portingale by deed
the which stood hard by the water side. And of this house, a gift was given
to the King of Protingale for ever by writing, the Copy whereof, for so much as
the Captain general should carry it with him, was enclosed in a Tablet of
gold, to the which the King did set to his firm and seal, also the Kings
pleasure was, that upon the top of the house there should be set a flagge, with
the royal arms of Portingale, that all men might know, that the same was
his. Which after that the Captain general had knowledge of, he sent unto the
King great thanks for the same, and from that time forward they had
indifferent good sales by the help of Cosebequm, who did aid them therein. As
soon as those of the Country had understanding that our Factorye was by the
King so favored, they likewise did the like. Afterward our men might go
wheresoever they would without any molestation, and as sure as they might in
Lishborne. So the friendship between them and our men, was afterward very
good.

How at the request of the King of Calycut, the Captain General sent to take
a ship of the Moors, and also after what sort the same was taken. Cap. 24.
Whilst this friendship continued between our men and the City, and they
being in so great a friendship and concord one with another, on the next
saturday following there did appear to those of Calycut, a great ship of the
Moors, which was far off, going from Coching toward Cambaya. And as soon as
ye same was discryed, the king sent word to the Captain General, requesting
him that for his sake he would send to take the same ship, for over and besides
that, there were in the same certain Elephantes, yet was there one which
exceeded them all, the which he would have bought. And although he had offered
for him more then he was worth, yet he would not sell him. Albeit the owner was
a dweller in Coching, and therefore he most earnestly requested him to send to
take the said ship, for so much as it did so highlye touch his honor and
credit: unto his request, the Captain General made answer that he would do
it with a good will, although that he was informed that the said ship was
great, and that there were within it very many men both Mariners and
soldiers, and that the same could not be taken without some loss of men, and
therefore it was requisite that he consented that his men might kill those y^
were in the ship, whereunto the king agreed. This being concluded, the
Captain General commanded that Pedro de Tayde with his Caruell, should go
take the foresaid ship, and that there should go with him a young Gentleman
called Edwarte Pacheco, which was thought to be a valiant soldier, and with
these there was a 60. men. The king also sent certain Moors in the Caruel,
that they also might view the order of their fighting. The Caruell being under
sail gave chase unto the ship till it was night, which being come, they lost
sight of the same, and going a long the coast all the quarter of the Moon,
they saw where he was riding at Ankor, and then Edwarto Pacheco commanded to
bear with him, and found those Moors with their weapons in a readiness to
defend themselves withal, howbeit as they were hoising up their Sails, they
easily judged the same to be of 600. tun, This ship for one in those coasts
very well appointed.
and that within it there were 300. fighting men, the most part whereof were
bow men, Edwarto Pacheco would not lay the same a boorde, for that he was
commanded to the contrary, but to sink him if it were possible. And having
brought him under his lie, he commanded to amain. The Moors making as it
were a mock of the same, gave a loud cry and plaide upon their Instruments,
and after this they shot off certain Ordinance which they had, and many
arrows, making therewith a show of readiness that they were in. They were
answered by our men with shot, of the which there chanced a Pellette to strike
hard under the bossome of the ship between wind and water, where there was
made a hole by the which there entered a great quantitye of water. After this
they shot again, with the which there were many of them slain and hurt, and
the other trembled with the fear they had of our Ordinance, with this they
bare toward the baye of Canonor, the which was hard by, where there were
riding at an Ankor four ships of the Moors, amongst them he came to an
Ankor. Now being within the said Baye, arrived also with the Caruell Edwarto
Pacheco, who commanded his Ordinance to be shot at them, and with the same
had taken them all, if so be that there had not come certain Paraos of the
Moors to succor them, the which were in the port, and as they were fighting
the night came on, which was the cause that al those Paraos were not by him
destroyed. In all these encounters there was no more then nine hurt of our men,
which was done by their arrows.

Night being come, Edwarto Pacheco brought himself forth of the Baye and came
to Ankor hard by an Island, for that he was there more surer then in the Bay,
whereas they might have set his ship on fire. And although that it were
contrary to his commission, yet for all that he returned in the morning, and
joined himself with his enimyes, who as soon as it was day, would have
ran their way, and as they began to make sail, he entered upon them in
the Baye, shooting of his Ordinance, with the which he struck the said
Ship, The Moors yielded unto our men.
and by this means they yielded, with this those of Cananor that were standing
at the water side, were very sore agreeued and would have come to succor
them, who after that Edwarto Pacheco began to dispend his Ordinance amongst
them; ran likewise their ways.

This being done, he went toward Calycut, to the which harbor he arrived
the next day, where the King came to the water side to see the ship, for
that they took the same for a miracle, and gave our men great praises. The
Captain General commanded the ship to be delivered unto the king with
seven Elephaunts that were within the same, which were worth in Calycut
thirtye thousand crowns, over and besides this, there was found in it great
store of merchaundise, besides those men whom he took captives. Also he sent
the king word that he needed not to marvel that so small a Caruell as that
was could take such a great ship, for that in matters of greater weight he
would be at his commandment, for the which he sent him great thanks, and
prayed him to send unto him those men that had done so notable an act, whom he
did receive very well, and with great honor, and gave them great gifts, in
especial to Edwarto Pacheco. Some affirm that after that the king had seen
this famous act that our men had done being so few, he had them from thence
forth in some fear, and was desirous to see them dispatched out of his
country, and therefore did consent unto that treason, of the which I will
speak of hereafter.

Of the Oration which the Moors made to the king, concerning the enterteining
of our men, and what answer there was made, and also policy used against
them. Chap. 25.
WIth the taking of this ship the Moors of Calicut were greatly afrighted in
mind, and sore offended with y^ king for that he made so great account of our
men, which as they thought was done to revenge their iniuryes, and for the
hatred or envy they had conceived against us, though indeed the king made
more account of our men then he did of them. By this means as they thought, it
was no other but to provoke them to leave his Country, in especial for as
much as our men brought them such great store of Merchandise, and as much as
they did, and brought as great store of spices as they did: Therefore they
determined to make unto the king an Oration concerning the same matter. And
being joined together spoke in the name of them all, one on this sort.

EMparather of all the Malabars, The Moors Oration against our men.
nothing less mighty then the mightiest king of the Indias, and most
fearful amongst those that are feared of all the Princes of the same. We
cannot but marvel much that thou having these two qualyties, would imbase
thy self to receive into thy Country these y^ are enimyes to thy law, and
strangers to the customs of thy kingdom, and last of al, do rather appear
to be rouers then merchants. If thou do receive them for want of such as
should bring unto the City those kinds of merchaundise that they do bring,
or else carry away those kind of Spices that they are desirous of, we would
then allow thereof. But there are too many that does the same, and men that
thou have known of a long time, and by the long continuance of them art
acquainted with their fidelity, which have increased so much thy rents, that
thereof we are a good witness. But thou having forgotten all this, would
receive those whom thou did not know, and do favor them so much, that
amongst so many, and such a multitude of good subjects as thou have, would
make choice of them, that they should revenge thy injuries, as though thine
own subjects were not sufficient men to do the same. By which deed thou
do abase thy power so much, that we for very shame, and for that we are
bound of duty to bring it into thy memory. For if so be yt thou well
consider what it is to make the^ reuengers of thy injuries, and give them in
respect thereof so great honor, it is as it were to show them plainly a
certain kind of weakness which indeed is not in thy subjects, but rather
do bolden them to make small account of thee, and so afterward to do that
which we do well know they will do, which is to rob from all merchants that
comes toward thy ports, to destroy thy country, and at length to take the
City, which is the end of their coming into these parts, and not to look for
spices, and this is most true, that from their country unto this is almost
five thousand leagues by sea, with returns and storms that the same voyage
has, over and besides the great danger of the voyage, and the charges of the
making of their great ships, and furnishing the same with ordinance, besides
the strengthening of them with men, much more all this being well noted, it is
plain that for all their great gains which they might have by their spices
in Portingale, their losses would be greater, Proves that we were rather
pirates then merchants.
in coming so far for them, which is a manifest proof that they are rather
pirates then merchants, which come into the country to rob and take thy city,
as they will do, if so be they do place themselves once within the same. And
when they shall possess the same house which thou did give them for a
factorie, they will make there a fort, from whence they will make thee wars,
when thou shall think least of it, which thing will come to pass, and now the
rather, since that thou do command the same to be made by thy subjects.
But this as we say we do bring to thy memory more for the good will which
we do owe to thee, then for any profit we do look for. And if it fortune
that thou will not remember us, there are other cities in Malabar where we may
make our habitation, whether for our sakes will be brought all store of spices.
Over and besides all this, the loyalty which we do owe unto thee does make us
to fear more the loss of thy estate, then to (...) for our own profit.

As soon as the Moore had made an end of his Oration, the king did gratify
them all very much, and told them that he would have a special care of all
that which they had remembered him of, and how in the self same sort he
supposed y^ matter indeed would come to pass. why he requested our men to take
the ship of Meca.
The occasion that the king took to request the General to send to take that
ship* was to see the experience of their valiant minds, and also why he did
consent to ye lading of their ships, was to the end there might remain in the
country their monye which they brought to buie merchaundise withal, according
as he did to such merchants as come into his port. Also at the last he did
promise that he would not forsake them for any stranger. Yet for all this,
the Moors did not remain fully satisfied, because the king did not command us
to depart out of the city of Calycut, and not suffer our men to trade there any
longer, for that was the principallest thing that they did pretend. Howbeit
they would not let but entermeddle in all our matters, especial in the buieng
of our Spices, which they did openly buy, and sent them secretly unto other
places. This was done with a determination, for yt they could not away with our
men, but would resist them, our men being thus resisted might then have
occasion the better to defend themselves, and so by this means they would
revenge their quarrels openly by fighting with our men. This they had great
desire to do, thinking to destroy our men openly, for that they were many more
in number then ours were, they hoped that when this matter was once begun, that
then the king would take their parts. Also they wrought by all means possible
to have the common sort of people on their side, inciting them against our
men, with matters which they made them believe that our men had done against
them.

How the Moors that dwelled in Calycut by means of the Factor and countenance
they had at the kings hand, did set upon the Factorye, where was slain in
defense there of the Factor with other of his company. Cap. 36.
BY means of this subtle dealing of the Moors, there past three months
before the Factor could get any spices more then he had, to lade two ships
withal: which was a great grief to the Captain General, for so much as
thereby he perceived very well that the friendship of the king was not
steadfast, but that he was a liar, and a man that used no truth at all. And if
so be that he had not tarried there so long time as he did, fearing that in no
other port he should find sufficient lading for his ships, he would have
fallen out with him, and so have gone to some other place. But forasmuch as he
had been there at so great charges, he dissimuled therewith only to see
whether with his good will he might lade there or no. The Captain General
seeing that all things were but delays, sent unto the king, requesting him to
remember those promises he had made unto the Factour, that within twentye
days he would deliver sufficient lading for the whole Fleet, and that now
there were three months past, and yet there was no more laden then two
ships. The king accused plainly of doblenes.
The occasion whereof he did not know, and therefore he was the willinger to
suffer the same, and that with great patience, hoping always that he would give
order for the lading of the rest of the Fleet. But now he saw how all things
went, and knew that it was impossible to make an end thereof.

For although he had promised that his Fleet should be the first that should
be laden before any other strangers, and that he was informed for most
certain, yt the Moors had bought for a less price great store of Spices, and
sent the same to other places, whether they would, he therefore requested him
yet to have him in his remembrance, yt now it was time for him to depart
toward Portingale, desiring him to dispa^^h him as he had promised. The King
as soon as he had heard what the messenger said, did show as in an outward
appearance greatly meruailing that our ships remained yet unladen, and
answered that he was very (...) therefore, and that he could not believe that
the Moors contrary to his commandment had bought spices under a color,
and sent the same a boorde some other ship whether it pleased them, he having
given commandment to the contrary, namely, that the Moors should not buie
any spices in hugger ^^gger. Affirming that if it be so they had so deceived
him, he would punish them therefore. Upon this immediately he gave
commandment to take those ships that were laden with Spices, with condition
that they should pay for the same the price that the Moors had bought at.
Nothing more acceptable to the Mores the^ to quarrel and fall out with our men,
The news was brought forthwith unto the Moors, and as there was nothing more
acceptable unto them, then to have occasion to fall out with our men, so
therefore did one of the principal Moors begin to lade his ship first,
and that openly with all sorts of Spices and Drugges. And for that cholar
might the more increase in our men, to take those spices, he found means that
certain Moors which the Factor took to be his very friends, and also
certain Gentiles, should make him believe that if so be that he did not send
to take that ship, that was a lading, that then he could not have lading
sufficent for the Fleet.

The Factor gave credit unto this report, and thereupon sent word to the
Captain General, what the Moors and Gentiles had told him, and that he
thought their saying to be true. And therefore since the king of Calicut had
given him license to take all such Spices as the Moors had laden, he might
the better now take that Ship. Howbeit the Captain general was loath to
deal therewith for all the Kings license, for he knew him to be an inconstant
man, and waying also the great credit, that the Mores were in with him, he was
afeard least that after they had taken the said ship, the Moors through the
Kings favor would rise against them. And this was the answer that was sent
to the Factor: yet for all that he did require him once more to take that ship,
saying, that if he did not, that then the King should be in hazard to loose
such Merchandise as he had there: nevertheless the Captain general would not
meddle therewith, and yielding for that his determination sufficient reason to
the contrary. But the Factor on ye other part ceased not to make unto him
sundry requests, and protestations, that he should pay all such losses and
damages, as should hap upon the King of Portingales Merchaundize, by his
defaults, for that he would not deal with the said ship. Thus since he saw
there was no other remedy, he consented thereunto, although it were against
his will: and therefore the xvi. day of December, the Captain general sent
word to those that were aboard ye ship, that was thus laden by the Moors, by
the order which was sent him from the King of Calicut, to command them to
depart, and for as much as they made but little reckoning thereof he sent the
next day all his boats to bring her within the harbor. After that this
report came to the owner of the ships knowledge, they made the Moors privy
hereof, whereof they were very glad, for that by this means there was offered
unto them occasion to fall out with our men. Heerevppon, they began in a
furious outrage, The Moors moved a tumult against our men.
running out of their doors like mad men, complaining upon us and our people,
by means whereof, they were tumulteously moved, and framed great outcryes and
larums, and always against our men. And after that they had thus done, they
ran to the King, with whom went the owner of the ship, complaining also upon
our men for the detaining of his ship, saying that our men had bought and laden
much more spices and drugs, then that the Merchaundize came unto which they
had brought with them, howbeit their pride was such, that they were content
with nothing; but as Thieves and Pirates would have all. At this instant came
the Moors, which did before help him very much, declaring many things against
our men, and how much the King was in fault, for suffering them within this
City, requesting him most earnestlye to give them license to revenge their
loss, which they had received. The King as he was inconstant and without any
fidelity, did grant them the same. As soon as the Moors had obtained their
request, The savage fircenes of the Moors against our men.
they came their way from the King, and took their weapons, and with a savage
fiercenes, like wild beasts, ran into the City in flocks toward the
Factorie, which was compassed about like a Castle, with the wall of the height
of a man on horseback, in the which were lxx. Portingales amongst whom was
Friar Henrick with his company of Friars. There were amongst our men no more
weapons then 8. Crossebowes, all ye rest had nothing but swords and clokes, as
soon as they knew of ye enemies coming, they ran to the gates of the Factory,
and when ye they saw they were so few, they judged them to be some quarellers
that came thither for the same purpose, and therefore were minded to defend
their gates, with their cloakes and rapie^s only: but afterward their power
increased so much upon our men, that by reason of their arrows and spears,
they could not endure there any longer: then y^ Factor commanded their gates to
be shut up, supposing that from the wall they would drive their enemies from
thence, and at the very shutting up of the gates, there were seven of the
enemies slain, ye which gates could not be shut without great danger, always
fighting valiantly. In this conflict, there were of our men many hurt, and four
slain: howbeit as well those ye were hurt as those y^ were in health, went up
upon ye wall of ye Factory, for to defend their enemies from thence with their
crossebowes. Howbeit the multitude of them at that present was so great that
they made show as if they had been in number four thousand. There came also
to aid them sundry Nayres, which all of them together, began to set upon
those that were in the Factorie, hoping thereby to enter. Aries Correa seeing ye
it was impossible for him to defend it any longer without some aid from the
ships, and for to give them to understand of their troubles, there was
displaide a flagge in the top of the Factorie: and as soon as the same was
discryed by the Captain general, he suspected it in himself to be that which
indeed it was, for the which sudden chance he was very sorrowful, for that
as then he was but newly let blood, Succor sent by ye General Captain to the
Factorie.
and sick in his bed, and therefore he could not go himself to succor them:
howbeit he sent Sancho de Toar, to supply his room, with all the Fleetes
boats, which went with such men as they had, but to resist such a number as
there was of their enemies, they were very few, which Sancho de Toar
perceiving, durst not disimbarke himself, neither yet come too near the shore
least that the enemies should come in their Almadias and Tonys, and so take
them, also that they could not hurt them, they lay so far off from the
shore: but they from thence could discern how valyantly our men did defend
themselves and there entering, although the number of their enemies did always
increase, for so it was needful for ye great flaughter, yt our men made of
the^, from over ye wall. Notwithstanding by means thereof their fury did so
increase, yt they caused to be brought certain (...) to overthrow part of ye
wall wtall, which were so great, that our men could not by any means defend
the same, being so few and so many hurt, with the enemies arrows and spears,
which came from them as thick, as though it had rained arrows. But perceiving
once the enemy began to enter, they would not tarry there any longer, but
went forth of the Factorye, by a door that opened toward the water side, where
they made reckoning to save themselves with their boats. But ye enemies
followed them always so narrowly, hurting and killing them, that in this
conflict Aries Correa was slain, so that there were lacking fifty of our men,
between those that were dead and taken captives, twenty only escaped, which
took the water, but those were sore hurt, amongst whom was a Frayer called
Friar Henricke, and a son of the said Aries Correa, which was but eleven years
of age, who is yet alive and is called Antonio Correa, and since that time has
done in the Indias, and in other places notable acts of Arms, as in the fourth
book I shall declare. Those that did escape, were taken into our boats, and
carried to the Fleet.

How the Captain general slew the most part of those Moors that were
aboorde the ten great ships, and then commanded them to be set a fire, and also
of the great destruction which he brought upon the city in revenge of the
death of those that were slain therein. Cap. 37.
AFter that these news were brought to the Captain general, he was not only
very sorrowful for the death of those that were slain, but also to see how
little prevailed the present which he gave unto the King of Calicut, as also
the taking of the ship, in the which was the Elephant, and now three months
were past that he had been there, and yet had laden no more then two ships, nor
yet could tell when to lade the rest, fearing also least in Coching he should
not be well accepted, for taking of the ship in the which was the Elephant. And
further waying with himself, how little or none occasion at all there was
given to use such treason against our men, he did therefore determine to
revenge himself upon ye King of Calycut, if so be that he did not use some
excuse for that which was past, whereunto if he would willingly yield, then
would he be content, The king of Calicut was far off from making a mendes.
so that he might there have his lading. But the King of Calycut was far off
from the matter, for he was very glad of that which ye Moors had done, and
commanded all such Merchaundize to be taken, as were within the Factorie, the
which were well worth four thousand ducats, and also take all such of ours as
were found alive for captives, although they were hurt, of the which there were
four that died. After all this, the Captain general seeing that in all that
day the King of Calicut sent no messenger to excuse himself of the fact, he
put the matter in question, whereas it was determined that he forthwith should
revenge those injuries that were past, for fear leastif he should delay so to
do, that then the King might have time to arm his Fleet, which would not
then be so easelye done. This being determined our men put themselves in a
readiness, to lay aboard x. great ships, which lay in y^ harbor full of
Moors: these at the first would have defended themselves, Just revenge
wrought upon the injurious Calicutta^s
yet for all yt our men did join with them, and fought with them so valyantly,
that they brake their order, killing many of them, and of those that remained
some leaped into the water and were drowned, others hid themselves in their
ships, and other were taken alive, whom the Captain general commanded to
prison, that they might afterward serve for Mariners in the Fleet. The ships
being thus come into our men's possession, they found within the same some
Spices and other Merchaundize which were hidden within them: also they found
three Elephants, which the Captain general commanded to be killed and salted
for their victuals, he commanded also those Moors that were slain to be
told, and there was found of them 600. The ships being discharged of all that
they had, they were set a fire before all the City, in the sight of many that
came to the water side to succor them, whom being Moors, as they were coming
in their Almadias, our men encountered and fought with them, but they durst not
go forward for fear of the ordinance. This was a wonder to those of the
City, to see ten ships burnt together. The King also was sorry therefore for
that he could not send to succor them. But if that which was done this day was
a wonder to the enemies to behold, then ye next day was much more to be
meruailed at, for the Captain general not being contented with the burning of
these ships commanded his ships in the night to be brought as near the shore
as he could, the one somewhat separated from the other. They had also their
boats before them, that they might reach the most part of the City. As soon
as the morning began to appear, immediately all the great Ordinance went off
amongst their houses, which after that the enemies had seen, and how near our
ships lay to the shore, they began to shoot at the^ with small pieces which
they had without hurting any of our men, howbeit of our ordinance, for that the
enemies came running in flocks, there was no piece that mist, and by that
means there were many that fell, and the others that drew toward the City,
where our ordinance also had made a great destruction, as well in the Temples
of their Gods, as in their dwelling houses. The fear was so great amongst the
Citizens, The fear that the King of Calicut and the citizens were in.
that the King of Calycut himself was driven to leave his Pallaice, and to go
out of the City, for that our men went thither to seek him out with their
pellets, so that hard at his heels they killed a Nayre, which was a noble man,
and ouerthrewe part of the Kings Pallaice. This destruction dured no more but
this day: and whilst it was a doing, there appeared two ships yt were coming
to the harbor, which as soon as they had discried us, went their way, and
therefore this fight ceased. The Captain general made after the^ with al his
fleet to Panderane, which is a Port not far off, where there was other seven
near to the land ready to succor them, in which there came a multitude of
Moors to defend them, and for that our ships could not come near unto the
shore, they left them. And the Captain general contenting himself with that
which he had done in Calycut, for that it was very late to make his voyage
toward Portingal, went toward Coching, and there concluded a peace, to see
whether he might lade there, for yt he well knew it, that there was more Pepper
then in Calicut.

How the Captain general arrived at the harbor adjoining to the city of
Coching, and there he concluded a peace between him and the King, and afterward
began to lade his ships. Cap. 37.
GOing under sail along by this city, ye Captain general took two ships of
y^ Moors, which after that they had discried our ships, bare as near the
shore as they could, for fear of our ships, but our men took them and when
they were discharged of certain Rice which they carried, the General caused
them to be set a fire, and so following his course he arrived at Coching the xx.
of December, which stands in the Province of Malabar, xix. leagues from that
part of Calycut, going into the South, Coching stands in 9. degrees, and the
scituatio^ thereof.
and being in ix. degrees toward the North. The situation thereof is along the
river, in the which the Sea does enter, by means whereof the City stands as
it were in an Island and that very strong, for that there is no coming to it,
but by certain ways. It has belonging unto it, a goodly great and a sure
Port, which lies before the mouth of this river. The land round about is watery
and low, and made into Islands: they have small store of victuals, but for all
that those which they have is very fresh. This City is builded much after the
manner of Calycut, and is inhabited by Gentiles and sundry Moors strangers,
which are come thither from many places, and are great Merchaunts, amongst
whom there are two that have fifty ships a piece.

In this Country is great store of Pepper, and the most part that they have
in Calycut comes from thence. But forasmuch as in Calycut there are more
store of Merchaunts which come from other places, therefore the same is richer
then Coching. The King is a Gentile, and is of the behavior and property of
the King of Calycut: howbeit he is very poor, by reason his Country is but
small, neither can he command any money to be coined in his City.

The Kings of Coching are in great subjection to the Kings of Calicut, for as
often as there chances a new king to succeed in Calycut, he immediately goes
to Coching, and dispossesseth him that has the same, of the whole kingdom and
takes possession himself thereof, so that by this means it lies in his
hands, whether he will restore that King to the crown again or not. Also the
King of Coching is bound to aid and accompany the King of Calycut in battle
against any other King, also he is bound to dye in the religion of the King of
Calicut. The Captain general, being come to this harbor, did there let fall
his Ankor, for that he was afearde to send Gaspar with a message to the king,
least he would run away, he choosed rather to send one whose name was
Michael Iogue, which although he were a Gentile and a stranger, yet he came
unto our Fleet, with intent to turn Christian, saying that he would go for
Portingale: whereupon the Captain general took occasion to baptize him, A
Moore baptized and called Michael.
and gave him the name of Michael, and for his surname as he was called before.
By this man he sent to ye king of Coching his message, certifieng him of all
that they had past in Calicut, and also y^ the Captain general had brought with
him great store of Merchandise to give in trucke for such commodities as there
were in Coching, with the which if so be that the King were not contented, that
then he would buy the same for ready money, whereof he had brought with him great
store, and therefore his request was that in trucke of his merchandise, or for
his ready money he would give him lading for four ships. The answer that the
king made to this messenger, was, That he was very glad of his coming to this
his Port, for that he was well informed of his strength and valiantness, and
therefore he esteemed them all the better, as hereafter he should well
perceive. And as for such Spices as he had there, he would give him ye same in
trucke of his Merchaundize y^ he had brought with him from Portingale, or else
for money as he should think best. And also that without any fear he might
send a land whom he should think good to provide the said lading, and for the
assurance of such as should travel about ye same he sent him 2. of y^ principal
Naires in pledge, upon co^ditio^ yt every day he should change them and take
others, for that all such as did feed a sea boorde, could not come any more
in the kings presence. The Captain General was well contented therewith, who
had the sending of those pleadges so quietly a board, for a good beginning, and
therefore he sent immediately for Factor of this lading Gonsallo Gilbarbosa,
which was sent before with Aries Correa, and for his Scriuenor he sent Larenco
Moreno, and for Interpretour one called Maderade Alcusia. Also the Captain
General commanded to be delivered unto them and to serve them in all kind of
affairs, four banished men.

The king having notice of the coming of the Factor a land, sent to receive
him the Rogedor of the City, who went accompanied with many noble men of the
Court, who brought them before the king. This king even as his rents did far
differ in value from the king of Calycuts, so he did also differ very much in
his estate, not only for ye furniture of his person, but also of the place in
the which he was in. For there appeared nothing else but the very bare walls.
The king himself was sitting within certain grates, made much like a Theater,
with the which the whole house was compassed about, The king of Coching much
inferior in wealth and state to ye king of Calycut.
and there was attending upon him very few men. The Factor being come before
the king, did present unto him a present which the Captain General sent him,
which was a Basin of silver to wash his hands in, full of Saforne, and a great
Ewer of silver full of rose water, besides certain branches of Coral, this
present the king received very ioyfulfully, giving unto the Captain General
great thanks for the same, and after that he had talked a while with the
factor, and with Larenco Moreno, he commanded them to be lodged, and so there
remained those three a land, besides the other four banished men. But the
Captain General would not consent there should remain a land any more, for
he judged that the fewer there remained a land, the fewer would be lost if so be
that there should chance the like misfortune to that which did in Calycut.
Howbeit that was far unlike, for yt the king of Coching seemed to be a man
inclined to virtue and all the loialtie in the world, which well appeared in his
favor, and in the using of our men, and in the dispatch he made for the lading
of our ships with spices, and in the commanding of help to be given by those
of y^ country, which they did so willingly and with so great a zeal, that the
same seemed to be ordained of God, that the trade might be brought from Calycut
to Coching, and that his holy Catholic faith might increase in the Indias, as
ye same did, besides the estate of ye king of Portingale, which might increase
also in riches as the same has done.

How the Captain General being at Coching, there came unto him a Priest which
was an Indian and a christian, from the city of Grangalor, to go with him to
Portingale, and also what else he told him of the christians of this city.
Chap. 39
THe Captain General being in this city and laden, there came unto him two
Indians which as they said were christians, and naturally borne in ye city of
Grangalor, which is hard by Coching, these were brothers, and were desirous to
go to Portingale, and from thence to Rome to see the Pope, and afterward to
Jerusalem to visit ye holy sepulcher. And being demanded by ye Captain
general what city y^ Grangalor was, and whether the same was only inhabited by
christians, and also whether they do esteem ye christian order of y^ Greeks,
or of ye church of Rome: one of the^ made answer, y^ Grangalor was a great city
in ye province of Malabar, standing wtin ye country at ye end of a river which
co^passeth ye same, by some parts ye inahbitants thereof, says he, are both
Gentiles and christians, also there dwell amongst the^ many Jews which are
smally esteemed of, there are also many strangers amongst the^, The discriptio^
and state of Gra^galor.
which are merchants of Surria, of Aegipt, of Persia, and Arabia, by reason of
ye great store of pepper which is there gathered, this city has a king
amongst themselves, unto who^ al such christians as dwell wtin this city do pay
certain tribute, and these dwell by themselves, where they have their church
made after our order, saving they have not in the^ any Images of saints, but
only certain crosses: they do not use bells, but when ye priests would have the^
come to divine service, the^ they do observe y^ order of y^ Greeks. The
christians have their Popes which have 12. cardinals, and two patriaks, and
many Bishops and Archbishops, all which do reside in Armenia, for thither go ye
bishops of Gra^galor to receive their dignity, he himself had been there with a
bishop which ye pope did consecrate, and he himself received at his hands,
orders of priesthood, and even so he is accustomed to do unto al others y^ are
christians in y^ Indias, and in Caitaio and also he is called catholic, and
their Tonsura is made with a cross. Of those two patriarks which they have, yt
one remains in ye Indias, and ye other in Caitaio, and as for y^ bishops they
are reposed in cities, Why the christians of ye Indias has a Pope.
as is thought convenient. The cause why they have a pope in those parts has been as is thought by the^, for yt in S. Peter's time he being in Antioch, there
arose a great scisme of Simon Magus, which was ye occasion y^ he was called to
Rome to overthrow ye same, and to help ye christians which were in great
trouble: and seeing y^ he must depart from Antioch, and for yt the church of y^
orient should not remain without a shepherd, he appointed a vicar to govern,
who, S. Peter being dead, should remain for pope, and those y^ succeeded him
should always assist him in Armenia, but after ye Moors entered into Suria and
Asia, and for ye Armenia remained always in the christian faith: the
Christians did therefore choose to govern it by 12. cardinals. Marco Paulo does
also make mention of this catholic pope, where he writes of this Armenia, in
which he declares there are two orders of Christians: the one of those are
Nestorians, the other Iacobites, The manner of shauing their priests differing
from ours.
their pope is also named Iacobite, and is he who^ they call ye catholic
Joseph. Moreover he told ye Captain general y^ in Grangalor are priests whose
crowns are not shaven as ours are, but only in ye midst of their heads they
leave certain hairs, al y^ rest is shaven, and also they have deacons and
subdeacons. They consecrate with leuened bread and with wine made of raisons, for
they have no other in y^ country. Their children are not baptized until xl.
days after their birth, without they be sickly. Those y^ are christians do
confess themselves as we do, they receive y^ sacrament and bury ye dead as we
do. They do not use the holy Oil, but in steed of the same they do bless
them, and when that any die, they gather many of themselves together, and for
the space of viii. days, they do eat abundantly, and afterward they
celebrate the obsequies of the dead. They make their testament before they die,
and those y^ do not so, ^he next heir shall inherit their lands and goods, and
if so be that the husband die first, the wife shall have her dowry, on
condition that she shall not marry in one whole year after, when that they
enter in their churches, they take holy water. Their opinion is that there are
sour Evangelists, whose writings they have in great veneration. They fast the
Lent and the Aduent with great solempnitie, and take regard not to break the
same, during this time they do exercise themselves in prayer, and on Easter
even they neither do eat nor drink any thing till the next day. They do use
to hear Sermons on holy Friday at night, they observe the day of the
resurrection with great solempnitie, with the two other days following, and
also the sunday next following, for that Saint Thomas on that day did put his
hands into Christ's side, they do keep it with great solempnitie, acknowledging
thereby that the same was no fantasy or dream. Also they keep holy with
great devotion the Ascension day and Trinity Sunday, and the Assumption of our
lady, her birth, and Candlemas day, and Christmas day, and all the Apostles and
Sundaies, as well the Christians as ye Gentiles. And they with great devotion
keep y^ first day of July in the honor of S. Thomas, they could yield no
reason or cause why they do observe that day. They have Friars of Negroes
which do live very chastely. Also there are Nuns of the same order. Negro
friars professing chastity.
Their Priests do liu^ very chastely, for if so be that they do not so, they
are deprived from celebrating. There can be no seperating of the man and woman,
but well or ill they must live together till death do separate them. They
receive the Sacrament three times in the year, they have amongst them great
Doctors, and open schools, in the which are read the Prophets: and also there
were in times past old ancient doctors doctors, which have left the
Scriptures of the old and new Testament well expounded or interpreted. Their
apparel is after the order of ye Moors. They have their day which they do
call I^tercalor, which is of 40. ho^^s. They know how the day passes away by
the Sun, and the night by the stars, for they have no clocks. The Captain
general was very glad of the company of this Joseph and his brother to carry
them to Portingale, for whom he commanded a good cabine should be given them in
his ship.

Of the great Fleet of ships that was sent out of Calicut to fight with the
Captain General, and what was the cause that ours did not sight with them.
And also of his departure from Coching toward Portingale, and how in his way he
was driven to Cananor. Chap. 40.
THe Captain General being in this harbor, there came unto him a messenger
from the king of Cananor, and also from the king of Coula^ (they both being
great princes) in y^ kingdom of Malabar, requesting him to come to their ports
or harbors, for yt they would give him sufficient lading for his ships, better
cheap then in Coching, with very many other offers of friendship. To whom he
made answer by a messenger that he sent, yielding unto them most hearty
thanks, certifieng them y^ at this present he could not go to lade at their
ports, for that he had begun to take in the same already at Coching, A great
Fleet of enemies.
notwithstanding at his next return he would do so, immediately after yt he had
laden his ships, there was seen a sea board a fleet of 25. great ships,
besides other small vessels. And ye king of Coching having notice thereof, sent
word forthwith to the Captain General, yt there was in that fleet xv.
thousand fighting men which came only to none other purpose, but to seek him
out, and therefore if so be that he should have any need of men, to send him
word, and he would provide him thereof. The Captain General answered, that as
yet he had no such need, for that with those few that he had with him, he
trusted in God, to give them to understand, what ill council they had taken,
to come and seek him out, for that he had well experimented their strength.
Truth it was the General believed steadfastlye, as he had spoken, in
respect of that which he before had past in the harbor or port of Calycut.
First with ten great ships which he found there, as also with certain that
were there a ground. And although the enymyes were scouring up and down in
the Sea, yet thereby it was apparaunt that they durst not come to the place
where he was, by a league, for all that they showed themselves to be set in
order to fight. The Captain General perceiving their intent, caused to wey
Ankor, and having his Sails spread abroad, departed with all his Fleet
toward his enimyes, in the which there went those Pleadges Malabars, which the
King of Coching had given unto him. Howbeit his determination was, to
return again to Coching, and so to deliver them. And going after this sort,
there fell upon them on a sudden such a great storm which came with a
contrary wind, that he was feign to return and to come to an Ankor again,
so that he could not bear with his enymies.

The next day following which was the tenth day of Ianuarye. 1501. the wind
came about in such sort and so large, that the one Fleet might lay the other
aboorde. The Captain General being desirous thereof, found upon a sodeine
missing one of his great Ships, in the which went Sancho de Toar, unto whom
it did well appear, by reason it was night, that he had forgotten himself.
And for because that next unto this ship, this was the principallest of all
the Fleet, in the which were placed the chiefest men, it was not thought good
to fight without him, the tather for that in the others he had but few men,
and of them the most part were sick, and of the enymyes were so many as the
king of Coching had sent him word.

And as the wind was prosperous to go forward on his voyage toward
Portingale, He makes tovvard Portingale.
and very scant to return toward Coching, he departed, making his course
into the Sea with his whole Fleet. After whom the whole Fleet of the enemies
followed, all that day till it was night, and then they lost their company,
and so returned. Thus going in his course, he began to comfort those Nayres
which were delivered unto him for Pleadges, with many pleasant tales, the
which was the cause that they fell to their meat, being three days there,
and had eaten nothing of five days of their sailing, and upon the xv. of
January, he came within sight of Cananor, which lies flat north from Coching,
and is in the coast of Malabar, xxxi. leagues from Coching.

Cananor is a great city, The description of the town of Cananor.
consisting of houses made of Earth, and covered over with broad stone or
^^ate, there are in this City many Moors that are great merchants, which
trade in all kind of merchaundise. There is adjoining unto this City a goodly
Baie, but there is in this Coast no great store of Pepper, no more then does
serve their own turns. Howbeit they have great store of Ginger, Drugs for
the Pothecaries.
Cardamomon, Tamarindos, Mirabolanos, Canyfistola, and such like. There belong
unto this City certain pooles of water, wherein there do breed Lagartos, the
which are like unto the Crocodiles that are in the river of Nilo, which are so
great that they do eat men, if so be that they may come by them. Their heads
are great, and they have two orders of teeth, their breath is as sweet as
musk, and their bodies are covered over with shells. Also about this city
there are in bushes great adders, which are very full of poison, so that with
their breath only they do kill men: also there are Bats so great as kites,
which in their heads do seem much like unto a Fox, having such manner of
teeth also.

These the Gentiles do feed upon, for that they are pleasant and sweet. They
have moreover in this City plenty both of fish, flesh, and fruits, and as for
rice y^ comes unto the^ from other places. The king is a Gentile, and a
Bramene, he is counted to be one of the three of the province of Malabar, but
he is not so rich nor of so great a power as is the king of Calycut, nor yet as
the king of Coulan. Unto this harbor arrived the Captain General, and came to
an ankor, (not only for that the king had requested him so to do) but also
for that he minded to take in there some Cinnamon, whereof he had none yet a
boorde, so that there he took in 400. Quintalls, Every quintall is 100.
weight.
and might have had much more, but he would not take it, wherefore it was
thought that he wanted money: whereupon the king took occasion to send him
word, that if so be the lack of money were the cause that he took no more
thereof, or any other spices, he was then much to blame, for that he would
trust him with much more if need so required, until he returned back
again, he or any other. He was the willinger to send him this offer, for
that he knew the true dealing of the Portingale, and how well they maintained
their promise: and for that he did bear us so great good will, the Captain
General made him answer, giving him great good thanks for the lyberall
offers he had made him: promising that if he lived, he would inform the
king his master of the great good will that he does bear him. And once
this, he may be assured to have him always for his friend. After this was
delivered unto him an Ambassador, whom the king of Cananor sent to the king
of Portingale to increase a further friendship between them.

What had chanced to the Captain general until such time that he arrived
at Monsanbique. and from thence to Lishborne, and how Sancho de Toar, did
discover the Island of Sofala. Chap. 41.
IN the mids of that goulfe, and on the last day of January, he took a great
ship, richly laden with Merchandise, and perceiving that it belonged to the
King of Cambaya, he would not meddle therewith, but rather sent him word that
his coming to the Indias was not to make wars with any, but if so be that he
minded so to do, it shall be with the King of Calycut, for that he had broken
the peace he had made with him: only out of that ship he took a Pilot, for to
safeconduct him, till he had past the gulf. And he being in the same under
sail, on a certain night, which was the xii. of February, they lost the ship
of Sancho de Toar, which in a storm, that rose suddenly upon them, A ship of
the fleet cast away
being hard by the shore side, violentlye they ran upon it, by means
whereof, there was kindled in the same a great fire, so that nothing was saved,
but only the men. Following their course in this tempest, they past by
Mylynde, only for that they could not take harbor there, nor on any other land
but only Monsanbique, which he took in his way, as well for the want they had
of water, as also to new rig their ships, for yt they went all open.

In the mean while he sent Sancho de Toar, to discover Sofala, and from thence
to return toward Portingale, with relation thereof. The ships being all
in a readiness, they returned toward the Cape Buena esperansa, and there by
reason of another great storm, that ouertooke them, there was shot out of a
ship a great piece of Ordinance, which ship was never seen after in all that
voyage. After so many great and cruel storms, and other great dangers, which
are innumerable to write of, he past the foresaid Cape, the xxii. of May, which
fell on Whitsundaye, and so following their course, came to an Ankor at Cabo
Verde, Diego Dias found at Capo Verde, and his voyage.
where he found Diego Dias (whose company he had lost before, when as he went
toward the Indias) who was driven into the red Sea, where he did winter, and
lost his boat, and where also dyed the most part of his men, and for that his
Pilot durst not venture to carry them to the Indias, did return toward
Portingale. And so after that he came out of the red Sea, what with hunger,
thirst, and oath diseases, all his men were consumed saving seven persons:
wherein God of his great goodness showed a miracle, for so much as in many days
before, they were not able to govern their sails, for that they were so
feeble and weak. The Captain general seeing that there came no more ships,
departed toward Lishborne, whereunto he came the last day of July in the
year of our Lord 1501. And after that he was arrived, in came the ship, which
shot off the piece of Ordinance in the storm, before that he doubled the Cape
Buena esperansa, and after him came also Sancho de Toar, who went to discover
Sofala, and made relation thereof to be a small Island, The Ila^d of Sofala
discovered.
standing hard to the firm land, and that it was inhabited by black men,
which are called Ca^res, and that out of the firm land there comes much
gold, where, as they say, there are mines thereof. And for that cause there
go out of the Indias thither many Moors, that receive the same in trucke of
Merchandise of small value. Moreover he brought with him a Moore, which was
given him in pawn of one of his men, which he sent into ye firm land for to
view the same. This Moore gave large information thereof, as hereafter I shall
declare. With this last ship there did return unto Portingale, of twelve that
went for the Indias, only six: the other six were lost.

How John de la Nueu^ went for Captain general of the third Fleet that was
sent to the Indias, and what he did after his arrival there, and how from
thence he returned toward Portingale. Chap. 42.
IN this year of our Lord 1501. the King of Portingale supposing that all
contention and strife in Calycut was finished, The third Fleet that went from
Portingal to the Indias
and that ye trade was settled as well there as in Quiloa and Sofala, and for
that he had sent the self same year for that purpose one Pedro Aluares:
therefore he thought best not to send any more then 3. ships and a Caruell, of
ye which two carried Merchandise to Sofala, and the other two to Calycut. Of
this Fleet he made General one called Joan de la Nueua, born in Galyzia, and
this charge was given him, for yt he was accounted to be a valyant Gentleman:
moreover, Francisco de Nauoys, Diego, Barboso, and Hernando de la pyna, war
appointed for his captains. There went in this Fleet no more then lxxx. men.
That which the king had given him in commandment to do, was this, that in his
way he should touch at the Island of S. Blaze. The order that the king gave him
concerning this voyage.
And being come thither, if it should to chance, that he should find missing
any of his ships, that then he should there remain ten days, and from thence
he should depart toward Sofala, and being there, if so be that there were settled
a Factorie, to discharge the Merchandise the which were appointed for that
place. From the which he might have recourse unto the Indias. And if so be that
he found not all thing so, that then he should travel with all diligence, and
as much as in him lay, to settle the same before he should go from thence:
which being finished, that then he should leave for Factor of that place Aluoro
de Braga, with all such Merchandise as were appointed, which went in the
Caruell. From thence he should go for Quiloa, and after yt he had been there, he
should keep his right course toward Calicut. And if so be that he should find
there as yet Pedro Aluares, to know whether he stand in any need of him, and
that he should obey him as his general, and will him to settle a factory in
Sofala, if it were not done already. This general being departed from Lishborn,
he came safely to ye Island of S. Blaze, wherein a branch of a tree was found a
shoe, and in ye same was a letter which made mention, ye Pedro de Tayde captain
of ye fleet of Pedro Aluares Cabral, which was hound to Portingale was past by,
and so making further relation what had chanced unto him in Calycut, and of the
good entertainment they had in Coching, where as then did remain some of our
men, and also how the King of Cananor showed himself very courteous. This as it
appeared, was written by Pedro de Tayde, to advertise all such Captains as
should pass by to Calycut. The Captain general with the other Captains
perusing this letter, did then determine, yt it was not requisite, to leave the
Caruell in Sofala, for that they had but few men, which was not above four
score. And with this they thought it convenient to go to Quiloa, where they
found a banished man, whom Pedro Aluares had left there, who likewise informed
the General, what Pedro Aluares had past in Calicut, the which he had learned
of certain Moors, and also of the ships that he had lost. From thence he went
to Mylinde, where he talked with the King, which told him as much more as the
banished man had done. And having the same for certain, they take their voyage
to the Indias.
he went over to the Coast of the Indias, to the which he came in November, and
fell to an Ankor in Ansadina, where he thought convenient to take in his water.
And being there arrived, there came in upon a sudden, seven great ships of
Cambaya, which were bound into the Straights. The Moors would have fought with
our fleet, but our ordinance was the cause that they durst not lay us
aboard, and so they went their way. After this, the Captain general departed
to Cananor: where he talked with the King, which certified him of that which
had likewise past in Calycut with Pedro Aluares, and what he had done, and how
he offered him lading for those ships which he had brought with him. Also he
certified him, how desirous he was to be at the King of Portingales
commandment: yet for all these fair words, the Captain general would not
take in there any lading, until such time he had been at Coching with the
Factor, toward which place he departed, and in his way he took a ship which
appertained unto ye Moors of Calycut, the which defended her self very
valyauntlye, but afterward he commanded to set the same a fire. And being
arrived at Coching, the Factor with the rest of his company went to visit the
Captain general aboorde his ship, who told him that the King was greatly
offended with Pedro Aluares, for yt he went his way without speking with him,
and for carrieng away his pledges: yet this notwithstanding, both he and the
rest of his company were always courteously entertained. In ye night they were
brought into his pallaice, yt there they might remain: and if so be yt in ye
day they were any thing desirous to walk abroad, then they were tended upon by
certain of his Nayres, which were commanded to attend upon them, and keep them
company for fear of the Moors, The malitiousnesse of the Moors.
for that they did not love them, but rather were desirous to kill them,
insomuch, that before they went to the Pallaice, they did one night set fire to
the house, wherein they did lie: whereof the King having knowledge, from thence
forth he had them to his Pallaice, and so commanded from that time forward
the Nayres to take a care of them. Moreover, he was told what ill sales he
should find there of such Merchaundize as he had brought, for that the Moors
had persuaded the Merchaunts of the Country to give little for the same: and
also advised those that sell the Pepper and other Spices, that they should not
sell the same but for ready money, and not in trucke of Merchaundize: and
therefore they told him that if so be he had brought no money to buy their
Spices withal, that then he should make no reckoning of the same. And
therefore for that the General had brought none, he would tarry there no
longer, but returned to Cananor, to take in there his lading, where the King
was so great a friend to the King of Portingale, that when he understood, that
he had brought no money, he remained his surety for a thousand Quintall of
Pepper, and for fifty of Ginger, Every Quintall is a 100. weight.
and for four hundred and fifty Quintall of Cinnamon: besides some linen
cloth, which is made of Algadon, until such time he had made sales of all
such Merchandise as he had brought with him, which he had left in Cananor, in
the hands of a Factor and two Scriuenors, and so from thence he should return
with the first wind, y^ which as then did begin to blow, and therefore he
would tarry no longer. To the intent therefore they should not depart without
their lading, he showed the Captain general this pleasure. The Captain
general seeing this his courteous dealing, did commend unto his custody
certain of his men, the which he left with him, for that he had sent with
Pedro Aluares Cabral Ambassadors to Portingale. This lading being taken in,
then on the xv. of December, there did appear in the Sea lxxx. Paraos, which
were past the Mount Dely. Whereof the King having knowledge, he sent word
immediately to the Captain general, that those were the Fleet of Calycut,
that came only to set upon him, and therefore it were good he should command
his men to disimbark themselves and their ordinance: The king of Calicut sent
lxxx. Paraos to fight with ye captain general
unto which ye captain general made answer, that he would not so do. For if
so be that the enemies came with that intent, he had a hope in God yt he should
be able to defend himself: and with that he put himself in a readiness. The
next day following, which was the xvi. day of December, before y^ dawning of y^
day, there was come into the Bay to the number of 100. ships and Paraos, which
were all full of Moors, being sent of purpose, for that the King of Calicut
was informed, that they were there taking in of their lading, so that he
thought by that means that neither ship nor man should escape, and therefore
they lay as they did about the Baye. As soon as the Captain general had
viewed them, he removed from the place where he was at an Ankor, and brought
himself into the mids of the Baye, leaving order with his ships, that they
should lay on loa^d with their ordinance which they had, with the which he
commanded them forthwith to begin to shoot off: which was done in such sort,
that they did never cease. And if so be that he had not done so, doubtless the
enemies would have laid their ships aboard, by reason there were so many: So
that it was impossible for him to escape, if God of his goodness had not
favored him, and provided by his mercy, that the enemies brought no
Ordinance with them. Wherefore they were the bolder to dispend amongst them
their shot, with the which there were many very sore hurt, over and besides
great numbers that were slain, and their ships and Paraos sunk, for they
durst not venture to lay our ships aboard, nor yet had killed or hurt any of our
men. The fight dured until such time it was Sun set, then the enemies held
up a flagge. But, for that he feared they meant thereby some deceit, he did
not leave off shooting: for otherwise they might have thought he had so done,
for yt he was wearied, or else for fear. But it was nothing so, for they did it
for the desire they had of peace, in respect of the hurt and loss of their
men, This flag was a sign and request of peace.
which they had received at our men's hands, whereby they were driven to such
necessity, that if so be that the wind had served, they had hoysed up their
sails and gone their way, and therefore they kept up their flagge. The
Captain general perceiving their meaning, (and for that the most part of his
Ordinance was broken, with the continual shooting thereof, did answer them
with another flagge, which was done by the council and consent of the other
Captains: and immediatelye upon the same, they sent a Moore, which came in a
small Boat unto him, whose message was, to demand peace till the next day,
which was by him granted, with this condition, that they should tarry no
longer in the Baye, but go into the open Sea, and so they did. The general
(although ye wind was partly against him) made likewise his course into the
Sea, although it were troublesome unto him. The Moors could not do the like,
for their ships and Paraos can bear no sail but with a forewinde. Yet for
all the trouble that was past, the General came to an Ankor hard by them, and
for all that he used in the night a great and vigilant watch, by the which they
heard the enemies rowing in their boats toward our Fleet, yet before that
they were known, they were almost upon him: their intent as it was presupposed,
was to set our Fleet a fire. The Captain General fearing this, commanded to
vyere more of the Cabells, that he might be the farther off from them.

And perceiving that the enemies did yet follow them, he then commanded a
piece to be shot of at them, with y^ which they were afeard, and so went their
way: and as ye wind came of the shore somewhat fair, they hoysed up their
sails, and followed their course toward Calicut. The Captain general gave
God great thanks, yt he had so delivered him from his enemies, and so taking
his leave of the King of Cananor, departed toward Portingale, they ariue
safelye at Portingal
where he arrived in safety with all his ships. After that he was departed,
there came to Cananor one of his men, called Gonsallo Pixoto, which was taken
in Calicut for Captive, whom the King sent with a messenger to the Captain
general. The effect thereof was, excusing himself of all that was done unto
Pedro Aluares, and further also what hurt he had done unto his Fleet in
Cananor. Moreover, he offered him, if so be that he would come to Calycut, to
give him his full lading of Spices, and sufficient Pledges for the assurance
of the same.

How Vasco de la Gama returned for Captain general to the Indias with a
Fleet of ships, and what he did till he came to Quiloa. Chap. 43.
THe King of Portingale having great desire to revenge, The iiii. voyage to the
Indias 1502.
the injuries and treason that the king of Calicut had done unto his servants,
did therefore cause to be made in a readiness a great Fleet of ships, with the
which he did determine to make wars against him. And having given the charge
thereof to Pedro Aluares Cabral, did upon certain just considerations take the
same from him again, and in his steed appointed for General, Don Vasco de la
Gama, who departed from Lishborne, the third of March, in the year of our Lord
1502. and had the charge of thirteen great Ships and two Caruells, of the
which besides himself went for Captains Pedro Alonso de Aquilar, Philipe de
^astro, Don Luys Coti^nuo, Franco de Conya, Pedro de Tayde, Vasco Caruallo,
Vince^te Sodre, and Blas Sodre, cousin germans to the Captain general, Gil
Hernand, cousin to Larenco de la Mina, Iuan Lopes Perestrelo, Rodrigo de
Casteneda, Rodrigo de Abreo and of the caruells, Pedro Raphael and Diego Peers.
They carried also a Caruell unwrought, which they should make an end of in
Monsanbique, of the which there should go for Captain one called Hernand
Rodrignes Badarsas: besides this xv. sail there remained making in a redines
other five ships, of the which there should go for Captain general, one
Steven de la Gama, who departed the fifth day of May, next after following.
After that the Captain general had doubled the Cape of Buena Esperansa with
his whole fleet, being at the furthest end of the currents, he sent the same
to Monsanbique, to remain there whilst he went to Sofala, according as he
was commanded by the king. He carried in his company four of the smallest
ships of the whole Fleet. His going thither was not only to see the
situation of the same, He goes first to Sofala to regrate their gold.
and to see whether there were any place convenient there for to make a fort,
but also for to regrate their gold, and this was done in xxv. days. The
frindship between the king of Sofala and him, was agreed upon, and that he
might from thence forth settle the factorie there. After that this was ended,
there passed betweens them sundry presents from the one to the other. And
having concluded, the Captain general departed from thence, and returned to
Monsanbique, and in going out of the river there was lost one of the ships, but
the men were all saved. Being arrived at Monsanbique he immediately renewed with
the governor the old friendship which in times past had been between them,
and by his condesent was left there a factor, which was delivered unto him with
other more of our men, which remained in the Factorie for no other purpose but
to provide always victuals for such Fleetes as should touch there, A house
appointed for the Factory.
either going or coming from the Indias. This being finished, and having made
an end of the Caruell with all his ordinance placed, he departed toward Quiloa,
with intent to bring him to be tributarie to the king of Portingale, the order
whereof he carried with him in his Register, which he meant to put in
execution, by reason of the evil interteinment he gave to Pedro de Aluares
Cabrall. And being come to this harbor or port, the king went to visit him, a
seaboord, which he did only for the fear that he was in, for the injury
which he had done to Pedro Aluares. After that he was come thither, there
arrived also Steven de la Gama, that came with other five ships, which he
departed withal out of Portingale. Now when the Captain General esteemed the
king but for a liar, and had got him a seaboorde, he would not trust him on his
promise any further, but did immediately threaten him, that if so be that he
would not pay tribute to the king of Portingale, he would command him to
prison, under the hatches of his ship. With the fear hereof, he promised to
give him yearly two thousand Miticaes of gold, and for the assurance of the
payment thereof, he gave in pledge a principal Moore, whom they do call
Mafamede Aleones, one whom he hated, for that he was a feared least he would
take the kingdom from him, for that he himself had usurped the same from
the right king. After that he saw himself at liberty, and in the city, he
would not according to his promise send his tribute, but rather hoped that the
Captain General would have caused the pleadge to be killed, by reason whereof
he should be rid of an enemy. But the Moore, seeing that the tribute came
not, was feign to pay the same himself, and thereupon the Captain General
did deliver him.

How the Captain General did take a ship of the Moors of Meca, at the mount
Dely, and what chanced unto him thereby. chap. 44.
THis being done, the Captain General, went forward on his voyage, toward
Mylynde, where he staide to take in his water, and to see the king: and from
thence he kept his course toward the Indias, and at the mount Dely, A ship of
ye Moors of Meca taken.
he met with a ship of the Moors of Meca, that was bound to Calycut, which was
taken by our men, for that they did defend themselves very stoutlye.

The ship being rendered, the Captain General went a boorde the same,
where he commanded to come before him the owners thereof, and all the
principallest Moors that were more there. He willed them also to bring with
them all such kind of merchaundise as they had, threatening them that if they
did it not, he would cause them to be thrown into the sea. They answered him
that they had nothing, for that all their goods were in Calycut. The Captain
General showed himself to be offended with that answer, and did therefore
command one of them to be thrown into the sea, bound hand and foot. The
others with the fear they had conceived to see this punishment, did deliver
all that they had, which was much, and that very good merchaundise, which was
immediately commanded to be delivered unto Diego Hernando Correa, that went for
Factor to Coching, and so he gave order that the same should be carried a
boorde another ship.

All the children which were a boorde the said ship, were carried aboorde
the General, for that he had made promise to make them all Friars, and to
place them in our Ladies Church of Belem, as afterward he did. The rest of the
merchaundise which were of the meaner sort, and of small value, he gave the
spoil of them to his men. The ship being unladen of the goods,
commandment was given to Steven de la Gama, to set the same a fire. This was
done after that the Moors were driven under the Hatches, to revenge the death
of those that were slain in Calycut.

This ship being set a fire, by the foresaid Steven de la Gama, and other
two, they leaped then into their Boats, leaving the ship burning. The Moors
that were within the same, after that they perceived the Ship to burn, did
break open the hatches: by means whereof they were set at liberty: and with
the water the ship had within it did quench the fire. The Captain General
seeing this, forthwith commanded Steven de la Gama to go once more, and lay
the same aboorde, to the which he went with sundry of his men, with their
wepons. Howbeit the Moors did defend themselves as desperate men, Desperate
minds in time of extremity.
not fearing death. Some there were of them that took firebrands and threw the
same into one of the ships, with determination to set the same a fire. Others
y^ threw the like at their heads. And for that the night drew on, they left
them there, because the Captain General was not of that mind, they should
remain there in the dark, for fear least the Moors should kill some of our
men. Howbeit he gave commandment, that the foresaid ship should be
watched, that the Moors should not run to land, which was hard by. The
Moors all that night did nothing else but cry out to Mahoma to succor and
deliver them from us. The dawning of the day being come, the Captain General
commanded once more that Steven de la Gama with some of the Mariners of his
ship should go and lay the Moors ship a board, and set the same a fire
again, which was so done. Now after that he had made the Moors to fly and
to join themselves in the poope of their ship, fighting always with them,
notwithstanding the which, certain of his Mariners and Gunners would not
leave them until such time the ship was half burnt. When the Moors saw the
fire, some there were that leaped into the sea with hatchets in their hands,
which they carried swimming, with determination to kill all those that did
pursue them with boats, whom like wild men desperately bent they did set upon.
Yet for all that there were many that were hurt, for that they came near to
our boats side. Howebeit the most part of them was slain, and those that
remained in the Ship were drowned, within the same, for that the ship did
sink. There were of them in all three hundred, whereof there was not one that
did escape: and of our men there were some that were hurt.

How the Captain General made peace and friendship with the king of Cananor,
and afterward departed toward Calycut. Chap. 45.
FRom hence went the Captain General to Cananor, An ambassador set to ye
king of Cananor.
and being come thither to an ankor, he sent ye Ambassador which he brought
with him for the king, who told him that he was come, and that his desire was
to speak with him. The king heerevpon commanded to be made a bridge of
Timber, which entered into the water as far as it was possible. The same was
covered over with Carpets, and other rich clothes, and upon it toward the land
side, was framed a house likewise made of timber, The meeting of ye king and
the Captain General at Cananor 1502.
covered over as the bridge before said, which was made for the meeting of the
king and the Captain General. The king being the first that was come, came
accompanied with ten thousand Nayres, and with many Trumpets, and other
instruments, which went sounding and playeng before him. After that the king
was entered into this house, there were placed the Nayres on the Bridge, those
that were appointed to receive the Captain General. Who standing there, anon
came the General in his Boat accompanied with all the Boats of the fleet,
being richly covered over and set out with their Flagges, besides that, they
carried certain Ordinance in the proer of their Boats. Also there were many
Drums and Trumpets with them, and with shooting of the Ordinance the Captain
General disimbarked himself, being accompanied with all his Captains, and
with sundry of his men, which went all armed. fleet in his port or harbor, by
ye which he feared to receive There were carried before him two great Basins of
silver and gilt, which were to wash his hands in, covered over with fine pieces
of Coral, and other fine things which they do greatly esteem in the Indias.
the Nayres viewing the same, did marvel to see the delicatnesse of our men.

With this the king came as far forth to receive the captain general as the
gate of his place, The present which the king of Portingale sent ye king of
Cananor.
where he embraced him, and afterward they returned together to the place from
whence the king came forth, where the Captain general had commanded to be
set a couple of chaires, upon the which, although it was not the kings custom
to sit, yet he did at that time for the Captain Generals sake. At this
present was concluded the friendship between the king of Portingale and him,
so that immediately after that the Factorie was settled in Coching, minding to
do the like in Cananor, where as soon as the same was done, he would lade
certain of his ships, and after all this the Captain General departed
toward Calycut.

How the Captain General came to the port of Calycut, and what he did there.
Chap. 46.
FRom hence the Captain General being come to the harbor of Calycut, before
they were known, did take certain Paraos in the which were to the number of
fiftye Malabars, that could not escape. The Captain General would not at the
first coming do the city any hurt with his ordinance, until such time he
had seen whether the king would send him any messenger or not. And tarrieng
for the same, there came a boorde him, a boat with a Flag in the same, in the
which there was a Friar of the order of Saint Fraunces, whom after that our
men had sight of him, they judged to be one of those that were in the company
of Aries Correa, and remained captive. This friar being entered into the ship,
said Deo gracias, by the same he was known to be a Moore, howbeit to excuse
himself he said that he came after that sort, that they might the rather
consent unto his coming a boorde, being sent with a message from the king to
the Captain General, about the setteling of a trade in Calicut. Unto this the
Captain general made answer, commanding him not to speak thereof, until
such time the king had satisfied him for all that he had taken in the Factory,
when he consented to the death of Aries Correa, and the others that were with
him. In this matter they spent three days with messages to and fro, without
any conclusion, for that the Moors did withstand the same.

The Captain general perceiving yt all these delays were but lies to spend
the time, he sent him then word that he minded not to tarry for answer any
longer then noone, and the same to be with effect, and to complie with him, or
else he would make him most cruel war, with fire and sword, and that
forthwith he would begin it upon such his subjects as he had taken prisoners.
And because the king should not think them to be words only, he commanded to
bring him a running glass of an hour, and therevppon he told the Moore that
went with the message, that of those Glasses there should run so many, The
Moors make him keep no promise with the Captain General, nor fear his
power
and as soon as they were ended, without any further delay he would command
all that to be done, which he had sent him word off. But all this could not
move the king to perform any thing that he had promised, he was so inconstant
and given to change, with every vain saying of the Moors: and the outward
show that he made of peace, was but feigned, by reason of the fear he had
conceived in himself, to see so great a fleet in his port or harbor, by the
which he feared to receive great loss, whereof the Moors did assure him the
contrary, which was the occasion that he kept no promise. Upon this the
Captain general as soon as the time was come, commanded to be shot off a
piece, which was the sign he gave to the other Captains, to command those
Malabars to be hanged, which were departed amongst the Fleet. After that they
were executed, he commanded their feet and hands to be out off, which were
thrown into a Parao and sent a shore with two Boats well armed, and a Letter
for the king of Calycut written in the Arabian tongue, in ye which he
signified unto him yt in such manner, he would pay him for all his feigned
lies which he had spoken unto this present. And as for his kings goods, which
he did deteine in his hands, he would recover them a hundred fold. After all
this, he gave commandment, that in the night there should be brought three
ships as near to the shore as they could, that the next day without ceasing
there should be shot all the great Ordinance that they had at the City, with
the which there was great hurt done, besides the kings house which was
ouerthrown therewith, and sundry other houses of the principal inhabitaunts.
This being done, he departed toward Coching, leaving to keep that Coast six
ships which were well appointed, of the which was named for Captain General
one called Vincente Sodre, to remain with them in the Indias, that therewith
he might go and discover the straights of Meca, and the coast of Cambaia.

How the Captain General came to Coching, and what he did there, and also how
the king of Calycut sent to train him thither, for that there he would
traitorously have taken him, and last of all he wrote a Letter to the king of
Coching. Chap. 47.
THe Captain general being come to the Port or Harbor of Coching, when y^
king had notice thereof, he sent him before he came a land, certain Pleadges
to remain in the ship for his assurance. And afterward he came in person and
met him. In this visitation the King did deliver unto him Steven Gyl, with all
the others that remained in his Country, and in recompense of that, the
Captain general delivered him a letter, which the King of Portingale had sent
him, rendering unto him most hearty thanks, for the good will he always showed
to Pedro Aluares Cabral: and that he was well pleased and contented, to have a
Factory setteled in Coching. Also there was delivered unto him a Present, The
king of Portingales present sent to the king of Coching.
which ye King his Master had sent him: which was a rich Crown of gold, full
of Jewels, a Cholar of gold all inameld, two Fountains of silver wrought,
two Arras clothes of Imagery work, a costly Pauilion, a piece of crimson
Satin, and another of Sendall, all which ye King did receive with great
pleasure. And for yt he understood not wherefore every of these things served,
he requested to be informed of the same. And therefore the Captain general
commanded the Pauilion or Tent to be armed, in the which was concluded a
further peace. Also he gave him a house to settle therein the Factorie.
Moreover, the price was agreed upon, how he would deliver the Spices and Drugs
that were gathered in his country: of all these things there was a contract made
and set down, which was confirmed by the King. And for a further assurance
thereof, the King of Coching, sent to the King of Portingale a Present, The king
of Coching present set to the king of Portingale.
which was two Bracelets of gold, set with stones, a towell which the Moors
do use of cloth of silver, which was two yeards and a half of length, two
great pieces of linen Cloth, which they do call Bengala, made of Cotton
wool, which was excellent fine, a stone of the bigness of a walnut, which they
do take out of the head of a beast: they call the same in the Indias,
Bulgoldolf, of the which there are but few found, and these are good against
all poison. The house in the which they determined to settle their Factorie
being granted, possession thereof was immediately taken by Diego Hernandus,
and other two which were Notaries: the one was called Lorenso Moreno, and the
other Aluoro vas with others. Whiles the Captain generals ship was taking in
of his lading, there came a messenger from the King of Calycut unto him, sieng:
that if so be that he would return to Calycut, he would restore unto him
all that had been taken from him, and that he should settle a Trade there. The
Captain general, after that he had considered upon the message, This
messe^ger was one of his chief chaplains.
commanded the messenger to prison, for this intent, to revenge himself on
him, if so be that the King did lie, since he had so oftentimes deceived him.
And being now determined to go toward Calycut, which was more to see whether
that he could recover the Merchaundize that were taken, then for any hope he
had of the Kings friendship, would for that cause go alone, leaving behind him
for his Lieuetenaunt, Steven de la Gama. The Captains that remained were sore
against his going alone, and especially after that sort, for fear of
mischaunce: yet he would not be persuaded but to go, saying that along that
Coast there was Vincente Sodre with the other ships, that were appointed to
remain in the Indias: and if so be that he were driven to any necessity, he
would join with them. As soon as the king was informed that he was come to
Calycut, he sent him immediately word, that the next day he would comply with
him for all such goods, as had been taken from Pedro Aluares, and afterward
he would renew the Trade, and settle the Factorie. But contrary to these his
words, as soon as he had knowledge that the Captain general was come alone,
upon a sudden he commanded to be made in a readiness xxxiiii. Paraos, with
intent to set upon him, and so to take him if it were possible. And indeed with
such a sudden came upon him, that to escape them, he was fain to cut one of
his Cables, which he had out, and so made sail. And as the wind was of the
land, he went somewhat further off from those Paraos, yet for all that they did
not give him over, but always followed him with such a vehemency, that had
it not been for Vincente Sodre and the others which kept along yt Coast, he had
been taken, but yet at length they were fame to run their way. Being thus
escaped, he returned to Coching, and as soon as he came thither he commanded
the messenger to be hanged, whom the King of Calycut had sent unto him: for the
which deed he remained greatly afrighted, when the same came to his knowledge.
But seeing now that by no means he could take him, he determined then to prove,
whether he could persuade the King of Coching to give him no lading, and also
not to consent to any Factory for him in his Country.

How the Moors were the principal doers herein, that moved the King to
write concerning that matter by one of his Chaplains to the King of Coching
after this manner.
I Do understand that thou fauourest Christians, The king of Calycuts letter
to ye king of Coching
and that thou have received them into thy City, and there do give them both
lading and victuals. It is possible thou do not foresee what danger may
ensue thereof, and also how much thou do displesure me. I do request thee yt
thou remember what great friends we have been till this present, and now thou
do procure my displeasure, in especial for so small a matter, as is ye
maintaining of those Christians, which are thieves, yt accustom to rob in
other men's Countries. From henceforth my request is, yt thou do not receive
them, neither yet give them spices: in the which thou shall not only show me
pleasure, but also bind me to requit thy good will in what thou shall command.
I will not now further request ye same, for I believe thou will do it with out
further intretie, as I would for thee in any matter of importance. This letter
being perused by the king of Coching, who was honest and true in all his
delings, he was not moved therewith, but answered the King of Calycut, after
this sort.

I Cannot well tell how it can be done, The aunsvvere of the king of Coching to
the king of Calycuts letter
being a matter of so great a weight, as is to put out of my City those
Christians, having received them upon my word: and to do it so easily as thou
do write. I will never request thee of any such matter, at the desire of
the Moors of Meca, neither yet upon the instaunce of no other Merchauntes,
that are Traders to Calycut. In receiving these Christians, and giving them
lading for their ships, I do believe that neither to thee nor any other, I do
offense: since that it is a custom we have amongst us, to sell our Merchandise
to those that will buy them, and to favor those Merchaunts, which do resort
unto our Country. These Christians came to seek me out far off, and for
that cause I did receive them, and promised to defend them. They are no thieves
as thou do term them, for they bring great sums of money, in gold and
silver, and Merchaundize, wherewith they do trade* Then friendship I do and
will observe, doing therein but my duty, and so ought thou to do, and
otherwise I will not take thee to be my friend: neither yet ought thou or
any other be agreeued or offended withal, for that which I do, is to enrich
my City.

With this answer the King of Calycut was sore offended: whereby he took
occasion to write this letter following.

IT grieueth me very much, The reply to the king of Cochings letter.
the hatred or envy thou have conceived against me, for that thereby I do
perceive thou will leave my friendship for those Christians sake, which I
take for my great enemies, and ought to be the cause that thou should accept
them after the same sort. Once more therefore I do return to desire thee,
that thou will neither receive them, nor yet give them their lading for their
ships. For if so be thou will not be persuaded, to the contrary, but rather
meanest to prosecute thine intent, then I take God to my Judge, and from
henceforth I do protest, that I am not in fault of the damage that will grow
unto thee thereof.

The King of Coching having received this letter, laughed at it, saying to his
Chaplain that was the bringer thereof, that he would do nothing for fear, but
that which he minded to do should be upon request, and so answered to this
letter.

I Have seen thy message, The king of Cochings answer to the reply.
which sounds as it were threatenings. God who always resists pride, does
favor him that has Justice and equity on his side. Since thou art my friend,
do not request me so an abominable and unlawful a request, as is to use
treason, especial amongst Kings, and if there be any other thing that grieueth
thee, and is not hurtful to mine honor, I will do it, yea, although it were
to my loss, which I do not esteem in comparison of mine honor. I do trust
that thou will take this answer in good part, and prevent the death of men,
and the destruction of thy Country. But if so be notwithstanding, thou will
maintain thine opinion, God does well know and perceive that hereof I am in
no fault.

The King of Calycut perceiving that the King of Coching, did stand so much
upon his reputation, and would not do that which he had requested him, did then
determine, (the Captain general being once departing) to set upon him by the
way, and utterly to destroy him, against whom he commanded to be made in a
readiness, a Fleet of xxix. great ships, that they might encounter with him upon
the Sea, at his departure toward Portingale, supposing, that forasmuch as they
went laden, he should be the better able to do them the more harm.

Of the battle that was fought between the Fleet of Calycut and the captain
general, as he was going toward Cananor: and how Vincente Sodre, Pedro
Raphael, and Diego Pieres took two of those ships, and how the Captain
general departed toward Portingale. Chap. 49.
OF all these letters and messages, the King of Coching would never make the
Captain general privy, until such time that he was ready to depart, and
then he told him, which before he was loath to do. And for that he should not
conceive and think him to be so vain as to alter his mind to do as the King
of Calycut would have him: Great friendship and constancy in an heathen Prince.
he did therefore show himself to be so constant, and such a friend of the
king of Portingales, that for his sake he would adventure to loose his City
if it were need. For this the Captain general gave him great thanks,
saying, that the King his Master would never forget that good will: and in his
name he promised to favor and succor him in such sort, that he should not
only have his kingdom in great assurance, but also that he would aid him to
conquer others. He willed him also not to fear those Letters that the King of
Calicut had sent him, for that they were nothing else but to put him in fear,
and bring him to be a traitor as he was, being therefore so destroyed, and that
from henceforth there should be made such cruel wars against him, ye he
should have enough to do to defend himself, much less to make wars against
others. All this he told him, for the succor of those ships which should
remain in the Indias.

These words were spoken before many of his Nayres, of the which the King was
very glad that they heard them. And for that we had knowledge that in
respect of the friendship that they had with the Moors, they were very sorye
that we had the Factory granted in Coching. Therefore the Captain General
promised unto the King that from Cananor he would forthwith send him thither
a Fleet of ships, from whence he was minded to depart.

Now after that he had laden his ten ships, and was a Sea boorde, three
leagues from Pandarane, he had knowledge of the nine and twenty great ships
of the Moors, that went to seek him out. And as soon as he had sight of
them, he consulted with his Captains to fight with them, upon whom with the
wind that did begin to blow, they did bear.

This being agreed upon, A battle by sea between our ships, and the kings of
Calicut
the General began to bear toward the Enemies. Vincente Sodre, Pedro Raphael,
and Diego Pieres, for that their ships were great sailors, went before them
all, and these were the first that did give the onset upon two of the chiefest
ships. Vincente Sodre, fought with the one alone, and Pedro Raphael, and Diego
Pieres with the other. Their meeting was with such a valiant mind, that out
of both the Enimyes ships there leapt many into the Sea. The fight endured no
longer, but until such time the Captain general with the other ships drew
near, who did always shoot off at them. In the mean while the rest of the
Enemies did bear all that they could toward the shore. The Captain general
for fear of the loss of some of his ships, would not follow, the rather
for that they were all laden: Howbeit, our men leapte into their boats, and
there fought with those that were swimming in the water, and slew them all:
the which were near to the number of three hundred persons.

After this the Captain General commanded to discharge their Ships, which
were taken, in the which was found store of rich Merchaundize: A rich price
taken from the enemy.
and amongst the same these pieces following: Six great Tynages of fine
Earth, which they do call Porcelanas, and the same is very costlye, as by
experience thereof we do see in Portingale: four great Guyndes of silver, with
certain perfuming Pannes of silver: also they there found, certain Basins of
silver and gylte, in the which they do use to spit. But that which exceeded
the rest, was an Idol of Gold, which weighed thirty pound weight, with a
monstrous face and for his eyes he had two very fine Emerauldes: a Vestement
of beaten gold, wrought and set with fine stone, the which vestement belonged
unto this Idol, with a Carbuncle or Rubie in his breast as big as a Crosado,
which gave as great a light as it had been a fire. The ships being set a fire,
ye Captain general departed toward Cananor, where he was with the King, who
gave him a house for the Factorie, the possession whereof was taken by Gonsallo
Gill Barbosa, who was appointed for Factor, and by Sebastian Aluares, and Diego
Godino, Notaries, and by the Interpretour, called Edwarte Barboso, and sundry
others, in all to the number of twenty, of all whom the King took charge upon
him, with all that was in the Factorie: and bound himself to lade from
thenceforth all the King of Portingales ships of Spices, that they should at
any time have need of, and this at a certain price which was immediately
named. The Captain general did enter into the like bonds in the name of the
King of Portingale, to defend him from all those that should make him wars
for this cause. Also the King of Cananor did the like, and to remain the King
of Cochings friend, and not to help nor aid any that should come against him,
upon pain that we should make him wars: and of all this, there were
sufficient, The order that was given to Vincente Sodre, at the departure of
the Captain general from Cananor.
great and lawful writings made on all parts. After this, the Captain general
sent Vincente Sodre to go along the Coast, and to keep the same until
February. And if in the mean while there were any news or knowledge of any
lykelihood of wars, between the King of Coching and the King of Calycut,
that then he should Winter there in Coching: but if not, that then he should
go to the straights of the red Sea, to take such ships of Meca, as do pass to
the Indias.

This being dispatched, and those three ships laden with that they should
have, they departed toward Portingale with thirteen ships, the twentieth day
of December, in the year of our Lord 1503. and so arrived with all their ships
at Monsanbique.

And for that the ship that Steven de la Gama went in had a great leake, he
commanded the same to be unladen and brought a ground, and after that she was
newlye rigged, they departed. And within seven days after, there fell a great
leake in the ship yt Lewis Cotine was in, and for that it was in such a place
that they could not come by it, they were therefore driven with all the Fleet
to return to Monsanbique, to new rigge the same. Now the wind was scant,
they were feign to remain in a certain creek, until she was finished, and
afterward they returned to their voyage, They were dispersed by a tempest
and at the Cape of the Correntes they were so overtaken with storms which
came sodeinly, and with such a force upon them, and that against them, that
they were forced to stay there with all the Fleet. The ship that Steven de la
Gama went in did bear up only with her fore sail, and his sprit Sail all to
torn, by reason whereof he lost the company of the whole Fleet, and was no
more seen. And within six days after that the Captain General arrived at
Lishborne, she came in also with her Mast broken. This storm being past from
this Cape of the Currents, the Captain General followed his course toward
Lishborne, where he arrived the first day of September. All the noble men of
the Court went as far as Cascaes to receive and accompany him till he came
to the king. He had going before him his Page, which carried a Basin of silver,
within the same was laid all the tribute which the king of Quiloa had paid.
Being come where the king was, his grace honorably received him, according as
he did deserve, who had done him so great service, as it was to discover the
Indias, and to leave settled Factoryes in Coching, and in Cananor, which things
must needs redound unto the king to most certain gain and profit, besides the
great fame and honor which he got thereby, in being the first king that had
sent to discover the East parts, whereof he might make conquest, if so be that
it pleased him. So in satisfaction the king made him Admerall of the Indias,
and also gave him the title of Lord of Vydeguero, which was his own.

Of the news that were given out in Coching, how the king of Calycut put
himself in a readiness for the wars, and how Vincente Sodre would not
succor him, but went to the cape of Quardafum. Chap. 50.
AS soon as the king had knowledge that ye Captain general was departed
toward Portingale, he immediately determined to put his wars in execution,
which he had signified to ye king of Coching before. And so he marched toward
the village of Panane, where he began to join his power, which was
immediately known unto all those of Coching, for that it was not far of.
Wherefore the dwellers there were wonderfully afeard, saying, that they had
cause so to be, for that the king of Coching did all things contrary to
justice and equity. And since he did the same unto those that are of his sect,
and all most naturally borne with him, why should he not do the like unto the
christians which are our enemies? And for that God does well perceive the just
quarrel the king of Calycut has to make him wars, that he will therefore
aid and succor him therein, Both commons and noble me^ repine against their
king and our men.
upon the charges of those that are innocents thereof. This they did not only
tell our men, but also in every place they railed at them, and endeavored to
procure as much hurt as they could against them.

Some of them also that were in credit with the king, and ought us no great
good will, did openly say, that if so be that the king of Calycut did come
with a greater power then they had, they would immediatlye deliver our men
unto him, since the wars were begun in respect of us and for our sakes,
they did put in hazard the loss of their kingdom. The king meruailing much
of the boldness of his subjects, answered them with loving words, saying
that they had offended him very sore with their vain speech, assuring them,
that if so be that the king of Calycut would come and seek him out, yet he
would notwithstanding defend himself, only for that he well knows, that
God will favor him, for his just dealing in defending those christians, as he
had taken upon him to do. But for all this his subjects could not be well
pacified, whereof some were desirous to set upon our men, but yet they durst
not, for that the king had allowed them a guard to attend upon them, and also
appointed a strong place for their lodging. Upon this, there came news that
Vincente Sodre was come to Coching, who had left great hurt done along the
coast of Calicut, both by water and by land.

Of whose coming all our men were very glad, for that they were before in
great danger. But the Factor perceiving that they came not a land, sent the
Captain general word by Laurenco Moreno, the certeintie they heard of the
wars, which the king of Calycut was minded to make upon the king of Coching,
and where he was at that present in a readiness for the same. The Captain
general excuses himself for deling on the land.
Requesting him on his behalf, and requiring him in the name of the king of
Portingale, that he would forthwith disimbarke himself, for that with his
being in Coching they were certain they should remain conquerours, yielding
sufficient reason for the same, and otherwise that they were in great danger.
The General answered, that he was appointed for Captain General of the Sea,
and not of the land, and did therefore remain in the Indias, only to keep
the seas.

Nevertheless if so be that the king of Calycut had prepared his wars
against the king of Coching, by sea, he would have defended him, but since it
was by land, he had nothing to do withal, but to suffer the king to defend
himself, for that he would depart to discover the red Sea. The Factor upon
this determinate answer, did once more send unto him, requiring him on Gods
behalf, and the king of Portingales that he would not leave them so, for that
the king of Cochings power was but small to defend himself withal, in these
wars against the king of Calicut, who had begun the same only and for none
other cause, but to destroy our Factorie. And therefore he as Captain General
of the king of Portingale, This general captain had other matters of more
profit in hand.
was bound for to defend him, and that this was the principal cause why he
remained in the Indias. But for all this the General would not tarry, and so
he departed with the rest of his Fleet toward the Cape de Quardafum, where he
did well know that he should take sundry rich prises. This was that which he
did better remember, then to stay and defend the king of Coching or the king of
Portingales Factorie.

How the king of Calicut signified unto his noble men, and all such as did
assist him, the causes why he made this war against the king of Coching. And
how the Prince Nabeadarni was he, that only spoke against the same. chap. 50.
AFter that the king of Calycut was come to Panane, thither also came
presentlye sundry noble men his subjects and others his friends whom he had
sent for to aid and succor him in this enterprise. Others there were that
came before they were sent for: For as soon they heard that the wars were
begun, and that for our sakes that remained in Coching (of the which they were
all glad) hoping thereby to hunt us out of the Indias, and therefore they came
with the better good will to seek the destruction of the king of Coching. There
were also of his own subjects that arose against him, and some of his
nobilitye, as the Caimall of Chirapipill, and he of Cambalane, and also he of
the great Island which is over against Coching, who carried with them all the
power that they were able to make. And being come into the presence of the
king of Calycut, he spoke unto them all.

IF that good works do engender friendship, The king of Calicut signifies
the cause why he begins to make these vvarres against the king of Coching.
amongst men, then I, and you for my sake, and generally all the Malabars
ought to bear the same greatly unto the Moors, for that it is well known,
that it is six hundred year since they came into the Province of Malabar, and
in all this time, yea, to this day, there was never any that ever received at
their hands any hurt or loss. But having no sooner received strangers newly
come into any of our Countries, immediatlye we receive loss by them,
wheresoever they do begin to settle their trade. But the Moors do trade
with the people with all friendship, and love, as ought to do one natural
neighbor with an other, by whose means the Country has been always well
provided of much victuals and merchaundise, which has been a cause to enrich
our Towns; and that our rents are greatly increased, in especial within this
our City. For whilst the Moors are here resident, they have made the same
the greatest mart Town that is in all the Indias.

For this cause I am bound in conscience, and have great reason to favor
them, and to mislyke of the christians which to my great hinderaunce, yea, and
against my good will, settle in my land, more for to take the same, and to
destroy me, then to bring me any profit or gains as the Moors do,
having given of themselves great shows and signs thereof within these few
days, that they were here: as in taking of my Captain General, and my
Ambassador prisoners, in making of new laws in my City, to lade their
ships first, and before the Moors should lade. And upon this they took an
occasion to stay a certain Ship of the Moors, which was the cause, that
the Moors did as you do hear, and as I may judge by the sequeale thereof,
was so ordained of God for their pride, of the which he was in no fault. Yet
this notwithstanding, they burnt ten of my ships which lay within my harbor.

After all this, they with their Ordinance destroyed my City, so that I was
driven to run away out of my pallaice. Not contented with this, they burnt
me other two ships, which they would not have done if so be that they had
come to settle a trade. But first of all since they found themselves agreeued,
they should have come and made their complaint to me of the Moors, and
tarryed till I had punished them, and not to do as they have done, by which it
was apparent, that they are thieves and no Merchants, as they name themselves
to be, that under this color, they might conquer the whole Country. Which
things the king of Coching would never understand nor give credit unto,
although I sent him word. And being as he is, my subject, and well
understanding what they had done unto me, yet he would not but receive them,
and give them lading for their ships, and now he has given them a factorie, I
sending him word and praieng him many times that he would not consent thereunto.
For this cause therefore I have sent for you, that you should join your selves.
And also to request you to tell me your opinions, whether I have reason to
revenge my self or no?

This determination to them all seemed very good, Here this enterprise was
well liked of by his noble men and others*
and they praised his purposed intent, but principally the Lord of Repelyn,
for so much as he was a great enemy to the king of Coching, for that he had
usurped an Island of his called Arraul: also of the self same opinion were
other principal Moors. But against this his pretended journey spoke the kings
brother called Nambeadarin, which was the only heir to the Kingdom after the
death of his brother: who immediatlye in the presence of them all said.

THE kindred that is between thee and me, The answer which y^ prince made
to y^ foresaid Oration.
beside sundry other things, may certify thee that I do desire more thine
honor and profit, then any that be here present, and therefore my council
ought to be of a more efficacy then any others. For as they are not so
greatly bound to give thee the same as I am, so as it appears they do feed
thy humor, and council thee according to thy will, since thou art desirous to
accept it, and not according to good reason, which thou have to leave it. But
if so be that they without flatterye, and thou without passion, would judge
or weigh the cause of these Christians, thou should find, that unto this
present time they have given thee no cause, but that they should be well
received into thy Country, and so into all the Province of Malabar, and not to
hunt them forth like thieves, which they cannot be called, although they were
present. And forasmuch as from all the places of the world, men do resort
hither, and assemble themselves to buy those Merchaundise which they have not
in their Countries, and bring those hither which we have not here.

In the same sort come these Christians, and as the custom is of Merchauntes,
they brought thee in their kings behalf, the richest present that thou did
yet ever receive. And besides their merchandise they brought much Gold and
silver made in coin, which they do not use to bring which come to make
wars. And if so be they had come in any such sort, they would not have
dissimuled the running away that the Pleadges offered unto them whom thou
do call Ambassadors, that were kept in Prison, for that their Captain was
a Land.

But they reconciling themselves unto thee, went and took the ship at thy
request in the which was the great Elephant, and afterward did present thee
therewith, and with all that the same ship carried: besides, those that are
thieves do not use so to do, nor yet pay so well, nor use so much truth as
they did, for all the time that they were in Calycut, there was none that did
complain of them, but only the Moors, which they did, for that they are
their enemies, and being moved with envy to see them pertakers of their
profit, did accuse them that they had taken great store of Pepper from the
owners against their wills, they themselves being those that use the same, and
for that the Christians should not benefit themselves by lading of their
ships. And forasmuch as this was so apparent, thou gave them license to take
their freight, by the which license, the Captain sent to the ship of the
Moors, which was laden, and they being in all the whole fault, did yet
notwithstanding rise against them. These men then have done as it is well
known to the world, and yet for all this as quiet men ought to do, they
tarryed all one day to see whether thou would excuse thy self. But they
seeing that there came none from thee, they did then put in execution the
revenge, The execution of ye pledges defended by the kings brother
not traitorously as the Moors do, which went not to defend the ships,
although now they speak with a stout stomach, and council thee to make these
wars against the king of Coching, for that he did receive them into his
City, where no just cause is at all. For his receiving of them, it is not to
be judged that it is to hinder thee: but he received them as he would any
other merchaunt that would have come to his harbor. After the self same sort
did the king of Cananor, and the king of Goulan deal with them, who would not
have admitted them if they had known them to be thieves. If thou be minded
to banish them out of the Indias, and for this cause art determined to make
war against the king of Coching: it is requisite also thou make war against
the king of Cananor, for from thence they may do that which thou fear they
will from Coching. But I will not let to tell thee, that thou do adventure
thy self against him. For that as thou think he is of less power then the
king of Cananor.

These words were spoken by Nambeadarin, with such a stomach and so lyberally
to the King, that they were by him well taken: In one respect, for that he was
a very valiant Gentleman, and in another, for that he was with him in great
credit and authority. And for this cause they had him in great reputation:
Insomuch, that if the Moors and Caymayles had not showed themselves very
stout against him, the King would not have gone forward with his enterprise to
make wars against the King of Coching. The Mores overthrow the credit of ye
kings brothers Oration.
Howbeit, they stood upon their reputation so much, that they thought it would
be a great imbasing to their credit, in especially having assembled so great a
power as the King had done, and not to go forward, or at the least to do some
what before they did return. By means whereof, it was possible, that the King
of Coching hearing of their coming, would now do that for fear, which he
would not otherwise do before, being prayed. After all this, the King of
Calycut would needs know of his Witches, what day was good to march forward
in with his Army, who appointed him a fortunate one, and promised him the
victory against the King of Coching, and that as yet there would come unto him
more men. With this certainetie, which the Witches had comforted the King
withal, which he much trusted upon, he departed toward the Country of
Repelyn, which is four leagues from Coching.

Of the great fear that our men were in, least the King of Coching would have
delivered them to the King of Calycut. Cap. 52.
OF all this, whatsoever had past, was the King of Coching advertised, by
sundry espyes which he had in the Camp of ye king of Calycut: and therefore he
stood somewhat in fear of him, for that he had not sufficient men to defend
himself, forasmuch as all those that he hoped had favored him, were turned
against him: yea, even those that were his own subjects, whom if he had on
his side, he had been sure to have given the King of Calycut the overthrow.
Therefore, for that he had but few men, he was greatly afeard thereof, and the
rather, The very sight of our men abhorred in Coching
for that of those there, the most part served him against their will, in
especially they that were dwellers in Coching, which did abhor ye very sight
of our men, where upon they openly spoke it, that it were good that the King of
Coching should deliver our men to the king of Calycut, or else that he put them
out of Coching, and so he might acquit himself of these wars. Moreover,
there were many of the inhabitants of Coching, that ran their ways, and left
their houses, and all for fear of this war. Our men also on the other part
were greatly afearde to see this tumult, which gave them occasion to way the
danger that they were in, for all that the king did warrant them. Wherefore the
Factor fearing the success thereof, procured lycense of the King to go to
Cananor, hoping that there, they should be very quiet, until such time the
fleet should come from Portingale, thinking that the King by this means,
should break up those wars, that were pretended against him, and also his
Subjects be the better contented therewith.

But at those words the King seemed to be in heaviness, The aunsvvere which the
king of Coching made to the factor
and told the Factor, that now it appeared very well, that he had but small
confidence in him, that he would ask him license to depart, and therefore he
told him he would give him none: but rather requested him earnestly not to have
any such mistrust, for he there gave him his word, and it stood him so much
upon his credit, in preserving them all alive, that he would rather loose his
Kingdom and life withal, then deliver them to the King of Calycut, or to
other that should do them any harm. And if so be that his evil Fortune were
so great that he should loose Coching, yet there would not lack a place of
sufficient strength to send them unto, until the coming of the next Fleet
from Portingale to the Indias.

And although said he, the king of Calycut should come with a great power, yet
for all that he is not assured of the victory: for it is seen many times that
few with valyant hearts, Fevve having the right on their side, prevail most
times against numbers that come in an evil cause.
do give the overthrow unto great numbers without strength: much more having
as I have, Justice and equity on my side. And therefore he willed them to be
quiet, and to pray unto their God to give him ye victory. With these words,
knowing well that the King did speak them with a loving mind, our men
remained somewhat eased of the fear wherein they were, and would have kissed
his hands, but he would not suffer them so to do, nor yet would agree that
they should help him in his wars, which they did offer him to do, but
answered them, that he would not place them in any such dangerous place, for
that it stood upon his credit so much to keep them alive. And for that they
should remain as witnesses, how much he did travel to save their lives,
therefore from thencefoorth he committed the keeping of them unto certain
Nayres, such as he had a confidence in.

And that this mutenie might cease, and they from thence forth not have any
occasion to murmr against our men, he commanded to be called before him all
his Noble men, such as were with him, and also certain of the principal
Nayres, which were the occasion of all this trouble, and spoke unto them after
this manner.

I Cannot but be very heavy, The king of Cochings Oration to his noble men.
to see so little truth remain in you: For I marvel nothing at all at the
rusticall sort of men, whom oftentimes their poverty enforces to use all
kind of villanye. But of you, I do greatly marvel that are Nayres, that
have been always true in your dealyngs, that you now would have me break my
word and promise, that I have already given to the Captain General,
concerning these Christians, which was to keep his men to the uttermost of my
power, and to look that no man should do them any harm or vyolence, but
always for to have as good a regard unto them as unto mine own natural
subjects. And therefore he left them in this my City, which was done also by
your consents. And since you do perceive, that the King of Calycut has a few
more men then I, ye would persuade me to do contarry to my promise: so that if
I were of so ill a nature as you would have me to be, then ought you of all
other to abhor me, and cry out upon me. Be ye herein your own Judges, If
you remained with any other King upon his word, would you allow that as well
done in him, which you would have me do, by these Christians? In especial,
counting him as we account of this man, for our enemy, having none occasion so
to be, as the King of Calicut: and I your King, having no occasion to deliver
you, as I have none to deliver these Christians? Which, since it is so, what is
the council that ye mind to give me heerin, that may not be reprhended in
another? If it be for that you are afeard of the King of Calycut, It is better
to dye with honor, then to live with the infamous name of a rude and lieng
Prince.
then know this, that it were better to dye an honorable death then to live
with dishonor, then which there cannot happen greater to me, then to break
my word, nor yet more infamy unto you, then to be subjects to a rusticall and
a false King, in especial against these Christians, who have brought me so
great profit as they have done. And as for the King of Calycut, he well
knows that if he would have consented that the Factorie might have been
setteled in his City, he might have kept them in his Country. But now because
they are gone he moves these wars, the rather, for that he well knows my
power is but small, and therefore minds to revenge on me the loss he has
received. If his meaning be none other, then to hunt these Christians out of
the Indias, and to fight with him, whosoever receives them into his Country,
why then does he not begin his wars first with the King of Cananor? But
that is not the occasion only, but the envy which he has to see me
benefited, and for that with his pride he supposes, that I am not able to
resist him. All this do I very well understand, and moreover I do receive
comfort in preserving of these Christians, hoping in God, that he therefore
will give me the victory against him. And as touching you that are my friends,
I pray you therefore to stand to me.

Now all that were present hereby, seeing this his determination, meruailed
greatly at his constancy, and craved pardon at his hands for the fear they
found themselves to be in before, promising all of them to live and dye in his
service: for the which he gave them hearty thanks. Immediately after this, he
commanded the Factor to be called with the rest of our men, unto whom he told
all what he had done, and in their presence named for Captain general, The
kings brother made general of the field, and army*
the Prince Naramuhin his brother, and next inheritor to the Crown, and
commanded every man to obey him, in as ample manner, as his own person. His
charge was set down, that he should march forward with five thousand five
hundred Nayres, and entrench himself hard by the Foord, by which way he knew
for most certain, that the King of Calycut was determined to enter into yt
Island of Coching: whereas at an Ebb, the water comes up but to the knees.

How the Prince of Calycut made offer sundry times to enter into the Island of
Coching, by this Foord, and how he was resisted by the Prince of Coching. Chap.
53.
NOw the King of Calycut having notice, that Naramuhin had pitched his royal
Army hard by this Foord, to resist thereby his entrance into Coching, he was
somewhat feared therewith: in especial for that he knew the foresaid Prince,
to be one of the valiantest Gentlemen, that was accounted off in all that
Province of Malabar, and the most fortunate in wars. Somewhat therefore for
this fear, more then for any good will that he ought to the King of Coching,
to use any kind of courtesy toward him, he sent him this letter.

I Have travailed as much as I could to excuse this war with thee, The king of
Calycuts letter to ye king of Coching*
if so be that thou would temper thy pride, and do y^ which I have requested
thee, being as it is, so just, necessary and profitable unto us all. And for
that this our falling out might go no further, I give thee to understand,
that I am come to Repelyn with a great power for to enter thy Country, and
there to take those Christians which are with thee, withal their Merchandise:
yet notwithstanding, I will first advertise thee, that my desire is, that thou
do send them unto me, which if thou will do, then will I forget the envy
and hatred I have conceived against thee for that which is past, whereas
otherwise, I have promised to take thy Country from thee, and put all those
that are dwellers there, to the sword.

Although now the King of Coching had very great lack of men, and did well
perceive that it might come so to pass, as the King of Calycut had written
unto him. Nevertheless, he never meant to move his determination, but did
answer after this manner.

IF thou had demanded of me after a civil order, The aunsvvere which the
king of Coching made to the foresaid letter*
and with loving words, that which thou do command with so great a pride,
I would not have indged thee of less valor, then that thou think I might
take thee to be off: For where there is wisdom or strength, there is no
discurtesie showed by means of ill bringing up. These be things that God is
not pleased withal: neither yet have I so offended him, that I should consent
so much to my loss, or think that the victory should not be mine and these
valyant men's that are with me. Thou shall be welcome with all thy pride, and I
verily believe, that with these few which I have, over and beside my just
quarrel, shall suffice to defend me from thee, and other mine enemies. Thou
shall never find me so weak, that I will do any thing with such shame as
thou demaundest. And if so be, that thou have used to accustom thy self to
such deceiptes, so it is: I did never use the same, nether yet will I accustom
my self so to do. Touching the Christians, or any part of their goods, make
thou no reckoning, for that I do mind to defend the same. Therefore to be
short, send me no more messengers.

With this answer was the King of Calycut so offended, that he swear he
would destroy all, and revenge himself upon the King of Coching. And
therefore forthwith he departed from Repelyn the last day of March, and
entered into the Land of the King of Coching, in the which he did no hurt, for
that the Lords of that soil were all in his favor. And on the second day
of April, being come near unto this Foorde where Naramuhin was entrenched,
The Calicutians repulsed from passing over the Foorde.
some of the King of Calycuts Captains had great hope through the multitude of
their men which they had with them, to give the onset, with determination to
pass the Foorde: but it was so manfullye defended, that they retired with the
loss of many.

Whereupon the King of Calycut took this for an ill beginning: but for all
that, after that he had pitched his Camp, he sent the next day the Lord of
Repelyn with as many more men as there was the day before, and sundry Paraos
by water, supposing that then he would pass over this Foorde. But it chanced
far otherwise, and they mist at that time of their purpose, for that
Naramuhin as yet did valyauntlye defend the same with a stout courage.

At this present, were with him Laurenso Moreno, with other more our men, which
showed themselves like valiant Gentlemen, as before time they had done in
diverse other Battayles, which the aforesaid Prince Naramuhin had with his
Enemies, in the which he had always the victory, Inco^stancie ^n the king of
Calycut noted.
with the loss of many of their men. When the King of Calycut perceived his
loss, and being now, as he ever was, inconstant and fearful, he even
repented himself, that ever he did begin these wars.

For he thought that immediately upon his coming to this Foord, he should have
passed the same. Wherefore he sent again another messenger to the King of
Coching, that he forthwith should send unto him those Christians: who
answered, that since he would not deliver them before time, when as he had
occasion somewhat to fear his power, what shall he think he would do now,
when he has the advantage? But he advertised him to look well unto himself,
for that now he would not be contented only with defending his Country, A
stout stomach of a prince*
but hoped to give him ye overthrow: which indeed had taken effect, if so be
that his untrue subjects, had not forsaken him. With this answer the King of
Calycut remained in some fear, and indeed without any hope of victory, if so
be that it had not been for his own soldiers, which gave him council to send
to ouerun certain towns of Coching, which lay hard thereabouts, he would have
left the wars. Which had the sooner been finished, if Naramuhin had not been
driven to send to succor those Towns, with some of his men. The king thought
ye by this means remaining there but with the fewer, his strength should be
thereby diminished.

But this policy was prevented by Naramuhin, who had a marvelous forecast to
foresee such innouations. And for all this he furnished all places, where it
was requisite, in such sort, as though himself had been there present. And
notwithstanding all this, the King of Calycut lost many of his men.

How Naramuhin Prince of Coching, was slain by treason, which the King of
Calycut practiced: and also how the King of Coching received the overthrow,
and was driven to go to Vaypin for succor, and carried with him all our men.
Chap. 54.
THE king of Calicut seeing that his Captains could not pass through that
forde to encounter with Naramuhyn, he forthwith practiced how he might pass
the same by some policy. Treason practiced against ye prince Naramuhim*
For the which intent he secretly used conference with the pay master of
those Nayres which Naramuhyn had in his camp, and agreed upon this, that there
should be no payment sent to the Camp, as before he was wont to send daily,
but that they should go to Coching to receive the same there. And for his
reward that he should consent thereunto, he sent him a great present. By this
means therefore Naramuhyn remaining alone and unfurnished, his enimyes might
pass the said ford the better. This being agreed upon, the payemaister
according to his promise, sent word to the Captain, that all such Nayres as
were in wages with the king of Coching, should come and fetch their wages, for
that he could not send it them as before time. The Nayres having license of
Naramuhym, he charged them to return before day, who promised him so to do,
howbeit they could not come, for that their payment was delaied, till it was
broad day: and thus whilst they were in Coching, the king of Calicut entered
the ford with his whole power both by land and by sea, and with much
ordinance, and the whilst that Naramuhim remained thus alone, the king of
Calicuts power grew to be greater then ever it was before. Then gave he the
onset, at the which Naramuhin was driven to retire unto certain Palm trees,
where joined unto him all his men that he had left, he cast them into one
squadron, which being as they were but few, did oftentimes break the array of
their enemies, with the which there were many slain. But as Naramuhins power
was but small, Prince Naramuhim and his power overthrown.
so they were compassed round about. And after that he had done many notable
acts, he was overthrown, both he and two cousins of his which there also very
valiant gentlemen, with sundry others. Thus was he and all his slain which
remained in the field. The king of Calycut would not follow the chase of those
that ran away, for that it was night, for so long the battle endured. There
were many of the enemies slain also.

This news being brought to the king of Coching, he was therewith a while as
it were beside himself, and almost of every man taken for dead, in especial of
our men that were present. Those Nayres that were our men's keepers made no
account of them, for that they had enough to do to succor the king. When this
overthrow was spread abroad, partly for the ill will which they ought our men,
they said that they were the cause of Naramuhins death and the others, and
that the king was not able to deliver them from death. With this, the king
returned to himself, and began to weep, and spoke sundry words, which our
men did not understand, Comfortable words of a prince*
for that his remembrance was as it were taken from him, so that being hard by
him; he saw us not, but at length he asked for us, with that our men drew
near toward him, who made us also to weep, only to see him in that agony.
And being fully come unto himself, he willed them in any case not to fear,
neither yet to doubt that this mischance should have any such power, as to make
him change from that which he had always promised. For which words they
would have kissed his hands, but he would not consent thereunto, and hearing
the stir that his men made against ours, he said unto them.

NOw that Fortune does show her self froward against me, The kings Oration
made unto his subjects about the loss of his kingdom.
I had thought that as true friends and loving subjects ye would have traveled
to give me herein some comfort. But ye are desirous to follow and serve the
king of Calycut, which as often as I do remember, it doubleth my pain for the
death of the Prince my brother, and my Cousins, and since you also are against
the Christians, whom I have so oftentimes in commended unto you, you do well
know, that it will be much more grief unto me, that they at your hands
should receive any hurt (then I have already received for the death of my
kinsmen, since they like true subjects dyed in my defense) and you are
desirous to persecute those whom I have received under my protection, and such
as remain with me for my comfort. It were a hard matter for me to persuade
my self that this overthrow happened unto me, for doing unto these men as I
ought to do. Do you not judge so, for I will not believe that they were the
cause, neither yet for that I do favor them, therefore God does favor the
king of Calycut against me. Ouerthrovvs in war sent of God unto princes for
their of fences.
It is not so, but for that I have offended him otherwise: I am very glad that
there has been this occasion given, that I might receive condign punishment,
and that the King of Calicut might be the only executor of his justice. And
that also for all other offenses that I have done, I might be punished by him
in seeking my destruction, the rather for that I do keep my promise with
these Christians, in especial being as we be, so much bound unto them.
Therefore weie well this cause, and let it not sink into your minds, that for
vsings clemency to these Christians, and for defending them I receive this
punishment, neither yet that the King of Calycut has power to overthrow my
power which I can make, and destroy me altogether, although that now he
drives me out of Coching.

The Fleet of the Christians will not tarrye long, and then the General will
restore unto me again my Kingdom. In the mean space let us go to the
Island of Vaypin, which is strong, and for that the Winter is at hand, I trust
in God we shall escape the King of Calicut. And since my loss is far more
then yours, I comfort my self with this, requesting you to do the like, and:
not to be an occasion to renew my troubles with this your mutiny.

They seeing the great constancy of their King, meruailed much thereat, and
immediatlye did quiet themselves and promised him that they would do that which
he had commanded, and so they did. The constancy of ye king was so great,
that whereas once more the king of Calycut sent him word, that if so be that he
would deliver our men unto him, he would presently leave the wars, yet he
would not consent thereunto, but sent him word again, that since that he had
gotten the victory more by treason, then by valiantness, for if so be that
valor had been used, his brother and cousins had not died, but they were
betrayed by those that feign would kill him also. He did not pass for Coching
it self, but hoped that those Christians which he looked for every day, who
restore him unto it again, and likewise revenge his quarrel. This answer
being come to the king of Calycut, he commanded to destroy the whole country
with fire and sword, which commandment being once known, the fear was so
great amongst the inhabitants of Coching that the most part of them ran away,
The inhabitants of Coching fly for fear of the king of Calicut*
and with them went two Milanesis, which were Lapidaries, that remained with
the Factor, which upon the King of Portingale commandment were brought
thither by Vasco de la Gama: the one of these was called Joan Marya, and the
other Pedro Antonio. Those did discover unto the king of Calycut the fear that
the dwellers of Coching were in of him, and how that daily they came away.
They also did offer the king to make him ordinance, and afterward they made him
some as it shall appear in the sequeale of the history. The king of Calycut
made very much of this Milanesis, and gave them great rewards, to the end
thereby he might win them to make him more ordinance: and having certain
knowledge, how few people were left in Coching, and what fear those that
remained were in, and how few men the king had to defend himself, he put his
men in a readiness to take the same. The king of Coching carrieng some of our
men in his company, went to meet with the king of Calycut, whereas that day he
behaved himself that it was wonder to see. Nevertheless for all that the
enemies being very many, and the king somewhat hurt, he was feign to retire,
and for that he durst not tarry another battle, he therefore repaired unto
another Island called Vaypin, The king of Coching is feign to fly and leave his
city.
which is right over against Coching, and is very strong, to the which he
carried with him all our men, and all the Factorie, so that there was nothing
lost. The City being thus disinhabited, the king of Calycut commanded the
same to be setts a fire. After this he sent his men to enter the Island of
Vaypin, which for that our men and others did defend it with great valor, and
for that the Winter was at hand, and storms of foul weather did begin, the
king of Calycut was driven of force to give over, and to leave the wars, and
so went to Grangalor, with determination to return upon the same Island at the
spring. For the which cause he commanded to be made many trenches about
Coching, and left many of his men to keep the same.

How Vincente Sodre and Blas Sodre were cast away at Curia Muria, and what the
other Captains did afterward. chap. 55.
VIncente Sodre with his Fleet being departed from the harbor of Coching,
without having any respect to succor the king, or those that remained in the
Factorie, but would needs go toward the kingdom of Cambaia, to take such
rich ships of the Moors as come from ye red sea to Calycut. Upon the same
coast he took by y^ help of other Captains five ships, in the which only in
ready money there was found two hundred thousand Perdaos. The most part of the
Moors were slain in the battle, and their ships burnt. From thence he kept
his course toward certain Islands called Curia Muria, which stood a seaboord the
Cape of Quardafum, where he thought good to bring his ships a ground, which
were all open. He arrived there the twenteeth of April in the year of our
Lord. 1503 The familiarity and security of ye inhabitants of the Island of
Curia Muria.
1503. And although all those Islands were greatly inhabited by the Moors,
yet he would venture a land, ye rather for that the dwellers in that Island were
no men of war, so that with the only fear they stood in of our men, they
gave them good interteinment, selling unto them such victuals as they had, and
did converse in their company.

Vincente Sodre having brought a Caruell a ground, thereupon the Moors took
occasion to tell him, that in the month of May, there came always such a
torment or storm out of the North, that no ships do remain there, but are
driven a land. And therefore such as know the same, do immediately avoid the
danger, willing him likewise so to do, and to remove himself on the other
side of the Island, which will be a defense for them, and when the storm is
past they may return without fear. But he not making account of their words,
but rather judging yt they meant to do him some displeasure, would not go from
thence but answered them that their ships had Ankors of wood, that they were
driven so a shore, but his were of iron: and for all that the Moors could
persuade him, he would never be removed. Yet Pedro Raphael, Hernan Rodrigues
Badarsas, The effect which the torment wrought amongst their ships in that
coast.
and Diego Pierres would not tarry, but on the last day of April they went
their way, and as for Vincente Sodre and his brother, they remained. And when
the torment came and began to blow, their ships were driven on shore, for all
their Ankors, and were torn in pieces, in the which there were many men
slain. Amongst these there died the two brethren, and of the ships was nothing
saved, but only the Captains that removed with the Caruell that was brought a
ground. The loss of the two brothers was judged to come by the handie work of
God, for their sins, and for not favoring the king of Coching, and for leaving
the Factour with the Factorie of the king of Portingale in so great a danger.
And therefore those that were saved returned toward Coching to succor our men,
if happily they had any such need.

Amongst themselves they appointed for Captain General Pedro de Tayde, and
so they made sail at the entering of May. And for that the Winter of the
Indias was come, they passed great storms, whereby they saw themselves
sundry times in great danger. And for that they could not fall with Coching,
therefore they were driven to winter in Ansadina. Three or four days after
their coming thither, there came thither also a ship from Portingale, of the
which was captain a gentleman called Antonio delcimpo, who departed alone
after Don Vasco dela Gama: his tarrieng was so long by reason yt his pilot
died, by means whereof he was driven to keep the coast, so that with great
trouble and danger he arrived at Ansadina, where he was driven to winter, where
also they sustained great necessity for lack of victuals.

How Francisco de Alburquerque, and Alonso de Alburquerque departed to the
Indias, for two captains generals of two fleetes: and how they arrived at
Coching, and did after their coming restore the king of Coching to his
kingdom. chap. 56.
IN the year of our Lord. 1503.
1503. the king of Portingale supposing that the Admiral had left settled the
Factorie quietly in Coching and Cananor, The iiii. voyage from Portingal to the
Indias.
and that he should have no such need as to send any great fleet. Therefore he
determined to send but six ships, imparted unto two Captains generals. Of
the first there he named for Captain general a gentleman called Alonso de
Alburquerque, which afterward was governor of ye Indias, as hereafter I shall
declare in the third book. These were his Captains, one called Edwarto
Pacheco, of whom I spoke before, and Hernan Martines Mascarennas, who they said
died in the voyage to Gordo. Of the other three he appointed for Captain
general one Francisco de Alburquerque, cousin to ye other Alonso Alburquerque.
These following were his Captains, Nicholas Coello, one yt was in ye discovery
of the Indias, and Pedro Vas de la Vega. This Fleet departed fifteen days
after Alonso de Albuquerque, and so as well the one as the other, passed in
their voyage great storms, in the which was lost Pedro vas de Lauega,
Francisco de Albuquerque, which departed last of all, came first, and before
Alonso de Albuquerque, who brought with him Nicholas Coello to Ansadina, who
came thither in the month of August, where as yet he found Pedro de Taide with
their Captains, which were forced to winter there. And having certain
knowledge of the wars that were published between the king of Calicut and
the king of Coching, and all about our men, they went immediately with all the
Fleet, which was of six sails to Cananor, for that he would inform himself
the better thereof, and what had passed in Coching. At their arrival in
Cananor our men were very glad of their coming. The king of Cananor himself
reioysed so much, that he went to visit the Captain general a sea board, and
told him all what perticularly had happened to the king of Coching, and where
the king was.

As soon as he knew all this, he immediately departed toward Coching, to the
which place he came on Saterdaie at night, being the second day of September in
the self same year. As soon as his coming was known to the king of
Coching, there was great rejoicing at the same, not only of the king and our
men, The king of Coching rejoices at the coming of the Portingale fleet.
but of all the dwellers in Coching. There were sundry that at his coming did
so rejoice, that they played upon sundry sorts of instruments, in token
thereof. All those that were in their trenches by the king of Calycuts
commandment, viewing this great joy and mirth, and perceiving wherefore it
was, as soon as the night came, ran their way to Grangalor, for so the king
of Calycut had commanded them to do, who also knew of their coming by the
way of Cananor. Immediatlye on Sundaie in the morning, Francisco de
Albuquerque came to an Ankor at the entering of the river of Coching. The king
hearing of his arrival, also sent to visit him by the Factor.

On the Monday morning, Francisco de Alburquerque having left his ships in good
order, took his boats, being very well armed, and went in the same unto
Vaypin, and carried with him also two Caruells to succor him, if there should
come any Paraos from Calycut. As he went somewhat far off from the Caruells,
came after him Edwarte Pachece, who suspecting whereupon he went, leapt into
his boat with some of his men, which came after him, with such have, he made
with his rowing, that he ouertooke him before he came to Vaypin, where the King
of Coching was tarrieng for him along the water side, with as many men as went
with him to the Island. The king of Coching joyfully be holds the return of ye
Portingale Fleet.
The pleasure was so great of their meeting, that as soon as the King of
Coching had sight of our boats, he began to cry out saying: Portingale,
Portingale, and all those that were with him did the like. Our men also out of
their boats did answer after the self same manner, saying: Coching,
Coching, in despite of the King of Calycut. As Francisco de Albuquerque did
leap a land, the King of Coching was there ready, and took him in his arms,
with the tears in his eyes, for exceeding joy, saying: that his desire was to
live no longer, but to see himself restored to Coching, that his Subjects
might well perceive, how much he was bound to pass so great troubles as he
had past, and all for to serve the King of Portingale. In whose name, the
Captain general gave him great thanks, with promise to revenge his quarrel
upon his enemies. And for his part he gave him ten thousand crowns to spend,
during the time that he did not receive his rents, and this money was taken out
of the Coffer he carried: which gift ye king of Coching esteemed very much, for
that he was very poor. Also his subjects judged this to be done right
liberally as it was noted amongst them all: Liberalytie vvinneth the hearts of
the most barbarous and vnfrie^dly people*
and from thencefoorth they thought all to be well bestowed, that the King had
done for our men. Forthwith they carried the King to Coching, where he entered
with great glory, besides the rejoicing which his subjects made: and from
thenceforth all our men, were amongst them well esteemed. Now it was not long
after that the news how that the King was returned to Coching, was brought to
the King of Calycuts cares, and of the money that the Captain general had
given him: who seeing that there was likelihood of wars, sent certain Caymales
into his Country to defend the same, for that it joined unto the kingdom of
Coching.

How Francisco de Alburquerque began the wars against all those that were
enemies to the king of Coching: and how the Caymall of the Island of
Charanaypin was slain. Chap. 57.
THe King of Coching being put in his possesion, Francisco de Albuerquerque
took his leave of him: His intent was, that yet before night he would partly
revenge himself upon his enemies. And so he went to the Island which is over
against Coching. Now as the inhabitants thereof were somewhat forgetful, and
thought not that as that day he would return, so therefore did our men set
upon them before they were aware, and that upon such a sudden, that there
were slain of them a great number, and sundry of their Towns set a fire, and
afterward they embarked themselves without receiving any harm. And Francisco
de Alburquerque going toward his Fleet, met with the King, and told him what
he had done. The next day after, he returned to the same Island, to destroy it
altogether. He carried with him to y^ number of six hundred men, for so many he
had, with those that he found in the other two ships, and there went with him
al his Captains: The Caymall of that Island was tarrieng for him along the
water side, with two thousand Nayres, whereof the most part were bow men, y^
others had spears, swords, and targets. They did all they could to keep our
men from landing, which they did without receiving any hurt: and they being
galled sore with our Crossebowes, were driven away.

Our men followed them unto the other side of the Island with so stout a
stomach, The Caymal and (...) power, put to flight by the Portingale^.
that they had no other remedy but to take the water, leaving behind them
many of their company slain and hurt. And our men not having with whom to
fight, did set fire to all the Towns y^ were in the Island, so that the whole
Island was destroyed. The next day following, Erancisco de Alburquerque went to
another Island called Charanaipin, which was belonging to a Caymall, subject to
the king of Coching, who served in all these wars with the King of Calycut.
Concerning whom by certain spies that the King of Coching had in that Island,
he understood that he had made himself in a readiness, to defend himself
against the Captain general, having ready in arms three thousand Nayres of
the which were seven (...) and forty with shot, besides all their houses
(...) with sundry trenches round about. Also he had by (...) certain Paraos
with Ordinance in the same, which the king of Calycut had given him* These were
a^^oat in a certain harbor, where our men pretended to disimbarke themselves:
which were there placed, that they should resist our coming into that place,
if that it were possible. About this place there was great store of boats, all
furnished with Ordinance: but the enemies at the length, were driven to run
away, so that our men remained quietly in the harbor, where there stood in the
water, yea, even up to their girdles a great number, always (...) our landing,
The great valiencye of the Moors, in resisting their enemies landing.
throwing at us both stones, and sp^^res, and shooting off their arrows in
great plenty. But as one as our Ordinance began to go off, then they
desperat^ly began to run away and give place. Howbeit, they (...), did so join
themselves together, and that in such sort they gave our men enough to do to
disimbarke themselves for that the same was so valiantly by them resisted.

And for all that our men could do, they would reuer leave their old
altogether, but by a ^wordf^ and a little they retired themselves to their
Palm tree or to have amongst them succor: and there what with the hinderance
that our men found by those trees, they defended themselves a small time. But
afterward they ran away, and that without order, so that our men followed
them to the uttermost, in especial the Constable of Francisco de Alburquerque,
whom they call Pedro de lares, who found himself alone with three Nayres which
came toward him. The one of these shot an arrow, which struck him in the
breast, and for that he wore a breast plate, it did him no harm. And as the
Nayre loosed off his arrow, went off likewise his shot, and struck the Nayre in
the breast, so that he ouerthrewe him, and afterward shot off another piece
upon one of the others that remained, and killed him also. By the third he
himself was hurt in the leg with a certain weapon, which they do call a
Gomya, and with the same he that hurt him would have run away, but at length
this Pedro lares, killed him with his sword. Thus all the enemies being put to
flight, Francisco de Alburquerque did then determine to march toward the
Caymalls house, where he had gathered together all his force, which was somewhat
strong by reason of certain trenches that he had made about the same. The
Captains were divided on both sides of the Island, and each of them had their
men with them, and in the mids of the Island were placed those of Coching. In
this order they went all burning and spoylyng such Towns as there were, and
that without any resistaunce. Going in this order, there came certain Paraos
from Calycut on that side of the Island which Edwarte Pachecho had the charge
off, who for yt they were many in number did leap a land, and encounter with
ye foresaid Edwarte Pachecho, and had given him the overthrow, (if Francisco
de Alburquerque had not been) who came thither with those that he had in
charge. And for that he found greater resistaunce in his Enimyes, then he
looked for, and also being somewhat afearde least the Caymall would have come
thither to succor the rest, which if he had so done, would have put him in
danger: he therefore commanded* Nicholas Coello to take with him Antonio del
Campo and Pedro de Tayde, and to set upon the Caymals house, The Caymal slain
in defending his house valyauntlye*
who was there slain in defending himself valyantly. At that time many more
of his company were both slain and hurt, the house was likewise spoiled and
ransakt: of our men were hurt eighteen, and one only slain. In the mean
while that this was a doing, Francisco de Alburquerque and Edwarto Pacheco, did
put to flight those of the fleet of Calycut, many of them lieng along the
water side sorely hurt and slain, the others had enough to do to imbarke
themselves in their Paraos, in the which afterward they fled away. And in
remembrance of so great a victory as this was, Knights made after a valiant
victory.
Francisco de Alburquerque made certain Knights, for that through their
manhood the victory was obtained, for of three thousand Nayres the Caymall had,
the least part escaped: and the Island was all destroyed with fire and sword:
and thus after this sort was the King of Coching well revenged over his
enemies.

Of the wars which Francisco de Alburquerque began to make against the Lord
of Repelyn: and how by the King of Cochings license, a Castle was begun to be
made called Manuel. Chap. 58.
ALl this being ended, then determined Francisco de Alburquerque to make wars
against the Lord of Repelyn. And to begin the same, he departed with his other
Captains in the night toward a town of his which is four leagues from
Coching, whether he came the next day about eight of the clock. To receive
him, there were placed along ye water side welny two thousand Nayres, of the
which there were five hundred bowmen. Our men being come within a Base shot of
the land, began to shoot off in such sort, that the enemies were driven to
give place, and retire unto their Palm trees, who being there, did tarry the
coming of Francisco de Alburquerque. He being disimbarked, with the rest of
his company did give the onset upon the enemies, having Nicholas Coello with
his men in the forward, and after him marched the rest of the Captains. At the
first meeting were some of our men hurt with them (...) which they shot
standing behind their Palm trees, which to them were a very good bulwark.
Our men, seeing that as they were, and having those trees for their defense,
they could not make them to remove, did then remove themselves, and got on the
one side of them, shooting at them with their Crossebowes and Caleeuers with
the which there were some slain, and the rest fled away unto their Towns,
after whom our men followed so eagerly, that there was made a great slaughter,
yea, far greater then in the fields, for that there they were sperpeled and
here they took them altogether in their streets, where they might the better
deal with them. The Town being left alone, was immediately set a fire, the
spoil thereof was given to those Nayres of Coching which went with him: this
reward Francisco de Alburquerque gave unto them, that they should not think
his coming into the Indias, was to rob any man, but rather to revenge such
injuries, as were showed to the King of Coching.

Now at his return with this victory, he was ioyfullye received at the Kings
hands, The king of Coching thinks him self sufficiently revenged of his
enemies.
who requested him, not to trouble himself any farther, for that he judged
himself to be well revenged. But he answered him, that although his highness
was satisfied, yet he was not satisfied, but requested him to give him yet for
her license, for yt he accounted it not any pains to fight in his service.
Howbeit he seeing yt the king was contented, did then ask him license to buyld
a Fort of timber, forasmuch as after that he were gone for Portingale, there
might remain the Kings Factor^esure and without fear, and all such as
should be left in the same. And this he declared to be the greatest service
he could do to the King his Master, to consent thereunto.

To this request the King answered, that his desire was to serve the King of
Portingale, Here the king of Coching g^ue license to Francisco Alburquerque to
build a Fort in Coching.
with a greater matter then that was, for that he must needs confess, that by
his means, he was restored unto his Kingdom of Coching again. And therefore
he willed him to make the same, and what else he would: and if that need were,
he would command it for to be made at his own cost and charge.

This license being granted, with the consent of the other Captains, it was
thought good the same to be made hard by the river of Coching, right over
against the City within the land, for that there it was thought most surest,
and from thence they might best resist the coming of the King of Calicuts
Fleet. And for that they had neither lime, stone, sand, nor any other
necessaries thereunto, he was driven to make the Castle of timber, which the
King commanded to be cut in great plenty, as well Palm trees, as of other
timber. He sent also many of his men for the furtherance of the work, saying,
that he would not have any of our men to labor, for that as yet the troubles
were sufficient that they had sustained in the wars past. But for all that,
the Captain general would not let, but cause them to work.

The Captains were de^^ded with their men, and began their work the six
and twentieth of September, in the self same year 150^. It was a great
pleasure to see, with what diligence our men did labor: insomuch, that it was
said there, that there were no such men in the world again, as ours were,
for that they served for all ass^yes.

How the Fort of Coching was made an end off: and how Francisco de
Alburquerque and Alonso de Alburquerque returned again upon the Lord of
Repelyn. Chap. 59.
Four days after that the Forte was begun, came thither Alonso de
Alburquerque, who by means of the great storms and other foul weather,
could not come sooner: notwithstanding he brought all his men with him in
health, of the which, Francisco de Alburquerque was very glad, and immediately
departed a piece of the Fort to be made by his men, and hy this his coming,
the Fort was made an end off in a short time: A description and comendatio^ of
the Forte of Coching.
which being as it was, made of timber, was as strong and fair as though it
had been made of lyme and stone. It was builded square, and within the walls
from the one side to the other, it was square every way nine fathom. The walls
were made of two orders of Palm trees and other strong timber, firmly set
into the ground, and yoked together with hoopes of iron, and nailed with great
nails. Between the two orders of trees, they were rampered up with much earth
and sand, and at the end of each of these Corners, were builded bulwarks,
which were replenished with Ordinance. Also there was cast about the same a
Cave or Ditch, which always was full of water. The next day after that this
Fort was ended, there was made a solemn Procession, in the which, went the
Vicar of this Forte, who rarried in his hand a Crucifix under a Canapie, which
the Captains carried over him, sounding before the same their Trumpets, with
great joy. With this solemnity they entered into ye Castle, which the Vicar
did bless. And by commandment of the Captains, they caused the same to be
called Manuel, in perpetual memory of the King Don Manuel, unto whom all those
that made the same were subjects. The Fort being blessed, there was a Mass
sang, at ye which there was also a Sermon made by Friar Gaston, wherein was made
mention how much they were bound to give God great thanks, yt would permit and
condescend, that from so small a kingdom as that is of Portingale, and lieng
on the cape of the Occident, there should go Portingales to a land so far
of, as are the Indias, and to make there a fort amongst such a multitude of
enimyes unto the Catholic faith. And that by the clemency of God, this should
be but a beginning of many others. Also he made mention how greatly bound they
were to y^ king of Coching, for ye good service y^ heerin he had done to the
king their sovereign: which words being brought to ye king of Coching, They
follow the wars farther for ye king of Coching^ revenge.
he rejoiced thereat very much, and gave ye generals thanks for ye same. After
all this they returned and followed their wars against all such as were
enemies to the king of Coching, and beset certain towns which were along the
coast, five leagues from Coching, the rather for that they were advertised by
their spies, that those Nayres that should keep the same, were but few in
number. They carried with them for that place seven hundred men, and departed
two hours before day, notwithstanding it was nine of the clock before they
came thither, in the which towns there were more then six thousand souls,
over and besides children, and such Naires as were there in garrison, which were
three hundred, and those all bowmen, Alonso de Alburquerque, with other of the
Captains leapt a land hard by the first town: and Francisco de Alburquerque
with the others into the other towns, which were a Fawlcon shot off. In the first
they took the enemies upon a sodeme, with the fear thereof they made them
run away, for that immediately as soon as they landed, they set fire unto
them all.

Our men seeing the enemies to run away, went after them, At the alarome
sou^ded, the force of ye Moors increases*
and in ouertaking them there were many slain of them, and after that they
were weary of following them, they destroyed the country. In the mean while
the larome was raised, and for that this Island was well inhabited, there was
assembled together well nigh six thousand Nayres, which did set upon our men
at their imbarking, so that they were in great danger, in especial Edwarto
Pacheco, which found not his boat where he had left the fam^. They followed him
so narrowlye, that with their Bows and arrows there were of his men hurt to
the number of eight, although they defended themselves valiauntly, and killed
many of their enemies. But for that the enimyes were so many in number, they
had been worse handled, if so b^ those Captains Generals which were
inbarked, had not disimbarked themselves and ^^^coured them. The enymies seeing
this, and having lost their hope to revenge their injuries, more then that they
had done, did run away, leaving behind them the (...) well covered over*
with dead men, which fell: with their bows and hand guns in their hands. The
enemies (...) gone after this force, our men did set a fire fifteen, Paraos,
which were a ground, and took other seven which were a floate, and so
departed, going their way always hallowing and crieng, as who should say, they

THe Captains general having knowledge of these towns, and to the end there
should remain nothing of the Lords of Repelyn y^ were not destroyed* they

he commanded his men row a apac^, and by yt means he was the first that came
to the town, and that a great deal before day. And being weary with staieng
for the rest of his company, he commanded to set fire to the town, with
intent to burn the same: and for that the enemies were unprovided for his
coming, he supposed he might therefore do the same the better, and so he did.
The enemies seeing the fire, arose forthwith to quench the same, which our men
perceiving, did set upon them, and slew some, and the others ran their ways.
Thus they did for that they were of a base kind of people and poor, and
without weapons. The Naires knowing that it was our men that had set ye fire, A
base minded and cowardice kind of people*
came thither all such of them as were in garrison within ye town, which were
more then two thousand, who being together, did set upon our men very
desperately, insomuch that Alonso de Alburquerque with his men, was driven to
retire, for that they were no more then forty, of ye which there was one
slain, and of the others there were some hurt with their arrows They had all
of them hardly escaped, if so be that they had not retired, which was done not
without great trouble. And yet he could not have done so much if the boys of
the ships which remained in their boats, had not set fire to a Fawlcon, for
fear of the which, as soon as the same was shot of the enemies aparted
themselves. By this time it was day light, at the which came thither Francisco
de Alburquerque, who when he had knowledge what had past, commanded to be shot
of all the ordinance that the boats carried, which made the enemies to fly
from the shore. Whilst they were thus doing, Edwarte Pacheco did determine to
leap a land, somewhat farther of from the others, and going forth to do so, he
found there many Naires with their weapons, which had past by a narrow way, to ye
intent to succor their felows. As soon as he had sight of the^, he commanded
to bring his boat hard to ye straight, where with his ordinance he did hinder and
keep that passage. Then immediately came thither our men, which forthwith did,
leap a land, and setting upon their enemies, enforced the^ to ru^ away: and
for that they knew not the country they followed them not, The enemies town
set on fire*
but did set fire to the town. Then Edwarto Pacheco, and Pedro de Taide did
part themselves with their men to go and burn another Town which stood a
little above the ^ther, and in the way they met with eighteen Paraos, all
armed, of the king of Calycuts, which they did put to flight, and the town
being burnt, as they before had determined, they returned to their Generals.
And for that it was somewhat rath for to return, they went to the Island of
Cambalan* minding to destroy ye same, for that the Caimall was enemy to the
king of Coching, where they burnt a great town. From thence Edwarto Pacheco,
with six Paraos of Coching, went to burn another town, but before they could
accomplish the same, they fought a good while with their enemies, of the which
there were some slain. The Town being set a fire, he returned with his men,
of the which were seven hurt, and being retired, he fought with thirteen
Paraos of Calicut, which he did overcome with the help of Pedro de Tayde, and
Antonio del campo, which came thither at that instant. The enemies being
retired into a certain creek, there went after them Edwarto Pacheco, and was
the cause that one of those Paraos ran a ground; and so he took the same, and
in the mean while the others went their way. And for that our men that rowed
were wearyed, they went not therefore after them, but returned unto their
Captains general, with whom they went to Coching. They return from pursuing
their enemies*
And giving the king an account of that which they had done, he yielded
himself sufficiently contented with revenge of his enemies, and prayed them to
give over the wars.

What the captain General had done going for a Tone laden with pepper, and
how Edwarto Pacheco did put to flight 34. Paraos. chap. 6^.
NOw by reason of these foresaid wars, there was none that durst bring one
grain of Pepper to sell at the Factorie. Neither yet durst the merchants go
to seek the same out, and for all that they were able, they could not get more
then three hundred Bahares. And so they sent word to the generals, willing
them to send for it, being nine leagues of from Coching, y^ which they
immediately did, being accompanied with all the other Captains of the Fleet,
for that they should go for the same amongst all their enimyes. And because
they would not be known, they departed in the night, and in their way Edwarte
Pacheco did destroy an whole* Island, where he with only those of his own
company fought with six thousand of his enemies, and the Generals did in the
mean while put to slight xxxiiii. Paraos. This being done, Edwarte Pacheco
and Antonio del campo, went and destroyed a great town in the firm land,
fighting with, and putting to slight two thousand Naires, of the which there
were many slain and hurt, and of our men not one. With this victory they
returned to their Captains General, who sent immediately for the pepper, which
was but a little way of, and being night, themselves did depart toward Coching,
from whence they were minded to send the Tone which carried the pepper, laden
with merchandise to give in truck of the same. And for that it might go the
surer, Edwarte Pacheco was sent with other three Captains, who carried each of
them fifty men a piece, and of Coching therwent 500. Paraos* Edwarte Pacheco
being departed, did pass the foresaid straight before it was day, and therefore
he was not seens, and being broad day did pass by the mouth of a (...), The
valiant (...) of Edvvarte Pacheco*
where there were bow men without number, y^ which shot at our men with their
arrows. And if so be y^ our boats had not ben paueic^d or fenced with their
shields a targets, our men had received great hurt, for that the river was but
narow, so ye with their arrows they might reach them* Edwarte Pacheco seeing
that they were joined all together, and judging that on that sort they might do
them some harm, commanded immediately one of the Captains to keep y^ Tone,
and he with the other two, and also those of Coching did determinatly come with
ye proers of their boats a land, where there were two thousand men of the
enemies, amongst the which he commanded the Fawlkons to be shot off, the
which did so enter amongst them all, that with the same there were many torn
in pieces, so that it made the residue to retire from the water side, and there
remained place enough for our men to disimbarke themselves without danger, and
so they did. And as the most part of them carried handguns, so they did set
upon them with the better stomach. The enemies for all that gave no place, but
shot of their arrows, which were so many in number, that it was thought that
one met in the air with another. The skirmish was valiantly handled of the one
side, An hot and valiant skirmish.
and of the other, which in such sort endured a quarter of an hour, yet
notwithstanding, the enemy at length did run away, and left of their company
many slain, the cause whereof was, for that they brought no weapons to offend
their enemies withal. Then our men pursued them to a village, out of the which
there issued many Naires, which joining themselves with those y^ fled away,
returned upon our men with such a stomach that they ran in great danger, for
that there were of the enemies well near six thousand men. A great multitude
of those yt were there, did then as much as they could to go between the river
and our men, but to resist them that they should not so do, and to kill them
all, our men defended themselves, and repelled them with great difficulty.
And as the river was thus defended, so they ran into the same, in the which
they showed themselves to be valiant. And when they drew near to those that
were in their boats, they separated themselves into two several places,
leaving one broad way, that our men might the better imbark themselves,
standing without the danger of their Ordinance, with the fear of the which
the enimyes did suffer our men to imbarke themselves, whereat there was none
either slain or hurt, which seemed to be a miracle.

Here is contained the situation of the City of Coulan, and how the Apostle
Saint Thomas came thither, and there was martyred: and Alonso de Alburquerque
went and laded there, and in what place did settle a Factorye. Chap. 62.
Immediately after this was the king of Calicut advertised of the loss of those
^araos, and also of all the success that our men had in those wars, for the
knowledge whereof he used all diligence, in respect of the great desire he had
to turn us out of the Indias, for that naturally they could not abide us. And
fearing least that we should take their country from them, Why the Indias were
most earnest to hunt our men out of their Country*
they were so much the more desirous to hunt us away. This thing they procured
with great instance, and also were the occasion that we should have no Pepper.
Making this account, that if so be that we should go without the same unto
Portingale, it would be the occasion, that we would not return again to the
Indias. By this means therefore we were driven to provide for the Fleet in
their rivers, and that with such a number of men, that we could never have
above a 1200. quintall of Pepper, of 4000. Bahares, that the Merchants had
promised, and yet this we got with great shot of Ordinance, and hurt of our
men, and with infinite shedding of blood of the enemies.

In the end, the king of Calycut found the means by merchants his friends to
persuade with the merchants of Coching, to give to the Captain general no more
pepper, excusing themselves with the wars. Which thing was done in such sort,
that neither with the request of the king of Coching, neither with any gift
that was given them by Francisco de Alburquerque, he could move or persuade
them to give them any more Pepper. Now the hope of our men for having the same
any more in Coching being past, Alonso de Alburquerque with Pedro de Tayde,
and Antonio del Campo, were driven to seek for the same at the city of
Coulan, which they did the sooner, for that they knew that the governors of y^
Town were desirous of our factorie, the which was offered to Pedro Aluares
Cabrall, and the Lord Admerall. Those that thus went thither, were fully bent
to make wars against them, if so be that they would not give them lading for
their ships. Alonso de Alburquerque being departed from Coching with certain
Captains, came into the port of the City of Coulan, the which stands twelve
leagues from Coching, and from Comarin xxiiii. the which is beyond the same,
bearing toward the South.

This City (as (...) say) before that Calycut was builded, The discriptio^ of

was the principal of the Poruince of Malabar, and the greatest and most
principallest Port of all that Coast. Notwithstanding, as yet their houses be
both great and fair, and so are also their Pagodes and Chappells comparable
to these of Calycut. Their harbor or haven is very good, they are well
provided of all sorts of victuals, the people are in condition like unto
those of Calicut. The inhabitants are Malabars, Gentiles, and Moors, and the
Moors are very rich and great merchauntes, in especially since the wars
began between Calycut and us, for many merchauntes of Calycut left the
same, and now dwell there. They do trade in Coromandyll, Ceilan, in the
Islands of Maldyua, Bengala, Pegu, ^^matia, and in Malaea.

The king of this country is Lord of a great Kingdom, wherein are many great
Cities and rich, which have belonging unto them sundry goodlye harbors, by
reason whereof his customs are great, and for that cause they are rich of
Treasure, and are able to make a great power of men of war* which are for
the most part men but of little stature. He has always in his guard, three
hundred women, which do use bows, and are very perfect in the skill of
shooting. A guard of women with bovves and arrows.
They have about their breasts certain bands of lynnen and of silk, with the
which they do bind them so hard, that they are no hinderaunce unto them in
their shooting. This king has for ye most part of his (...), war with the king
of Narsinga, which is a great trouble unto him. He does continually or for the
most part remain^ (...) a City, the which they do call Call. The Governors
of Coulan are as it were Aldermen, in the which, there is a certain Church,
which ye Apostle Saint Thomas builded* coming thither to preach the Catholic
faith, by reason whereof, there were great numbers that turned Christians, as
well of the Gentiles, as otherwise, so that of them there are proceeded from
generation to generation the number of twelve thousand householders, that are
scattered abroad in the Country where they have their Churches. The King of
Coulan seeing how many were daily converted, and the danger thereof, did
banish him out of his Country, who being thus gone, went to a City called
Malapur, lyeng along that Coast, and is parcel of the Kingdom of Narsingas.
And yet being there, for yt he was so followed by y^ Gentiles and by ye
Christians of Coulan, did apart himself to ye Mountains, S. Thomas banished ye
country*
where they affirm yt he dyed, and from thence he was brought to be buried in
Coulan, in a vante yt was made in the foresaid Church. This Church is now
ouergrowen, with b^shes and woods, for that the City is disinhabited, only
there remains a poor Moore, which does keep the same, for that there are
no Christians near unto it: and there he lives upon the alms of all those
yt comes thither in Pilgrimage, as well of Christians as of the Gentiles, for
ye Moors does not let to give their alms likewise unto him, for that he was
buried in their Country. Alonso de Alburquerque being come to the harbor of
this city, and the Governors having knowledge thereof, they came to visit him
a board his ship, where within the same there was settled a peace, y^ which was
made upon condition, that we should have our Factory in the City, and also
should have as much lading of spices and other commodities, The conditions of
the peace made with the inahbitants of this City.
as would lade presently those ships, the which immediately they went about to
provide. In the mean while that our men were there, and whilst that the one
ship took in his lading, the other two kept abroad in the sea, to watch all
such as past by from other places and those that they could discrie, were
brought, some with their good wills, and others there were brought against
their wills, to speak with Alonso de Alburquerque, and to show him obedience
as to a Captain general of ye king of Portingales. He offered no hurt to any,
but only to the Moors of the red sea: for all such of them as he took, he
would cause their ships first to be ransacked, and afterward to be burnt, in
revenge of that they had done to Pedro Aluares Cabrall, of the which those of
Coulan were greatly afraid. The house for the Factorie being finished, and the
ships laden, Alonso de Alburquerque left there for Factor, one Antonio de
Sala, with two scriueners, the one called Rodrigo Aranso, and the other
Loparabelo: and for interpretour one called Madera, and two Friars for
Chaplains, with others, the which in all were xx. And so leaving them in
peace, he departed toward Coching.

How the Captain General departed for Portingale, and how he left in the
Indias for Captain General Edwarte Pacheco. Chap. 63.
ALL these things remaining in this order, there was sent a messenger to
Francisco de Alburquerque from Cosebiquin, a Moore of Calicut, which was a
great friend of ours, as I have before declared, signifieng that the king of
Calicut was determined to set upon Coching, immediately after he was gone to
Portingale, and so take the same, and to fortify it in such sort, that he
might defend the entering into the harbor, whatsoever army should come. And
for the furtheraunce of this enterprise, he had gotten the good will of all the
nobilitye of Malabar, and that also for certeintie it was bruited, that the
king of Cananor and the king of Coulan would secretly aid him. Over and
besides all this, that the Merchauntes Moors did offer him great helps toward
the same. After the self same sort, did Francisco Reynel write unto him a
few days after, and how that the king of Calycut was preparing of soldiers,
besides that he had commanded much ordinance to be made, and that the Moors
of Coching were greatly in his favor, and therefore he did advertise him not to
trust much unto them: within two days after the receipt of these letteres, the
king of Coching went to visit Francisco de Alburquerque, and after the same
manner told him that which he had learned of certain Bramenes that came from
Calycut, and willed him to beware and to foresee what danger he was in to lose
Coching, if so be that there did remain no army of defense for that purpose.
Laieng further before him, how many dangers he had been in for the
mainteinaunce of our friendship, and for that cause his own subjects had risen
against him, and that now they minded to do the like. Yet notwithstanding he
had such a hope in our men, and our help, that he desired none other succor
for to defend him from his enimyes, whereof he prayed him not to say him nay.

Unto this, The generals comfortable aunsvvere unto ye king of Coching.
Francisco de Alburquerque, answered him, that if so be that he did well know
whether he had gotten, by such losses as he had received, for the favor
which he had showed unto our men, he would receive other greater losses if it
were possible. For setting a side the great renoune and fame which he had
gotten of a true and valiant Prince, he had also recovered for a friend
the king of Portingale, which is Lord of such subjects as he has seen, who
also are his to obey and serve him in all thing, when need should require.
And farther, that they would with small trouble make him Lord of greater cities
then Coching, and that also he might believe, that even as they did restore him
unto his estate, even so they would conserve him in the same. And although that
there were made with the King of Calycut the greatest peace that could be, yet
he said he had so small a confidence in his doings, that he would not leave
him without an army of ships, before that he departed from the Indias, for
that he did well know, how little truth that King used. And if so be, that
until this time he had dissembled with him, it was only to see whether by this
means he might lade his ships, for otherwise he could not do it, in especial
ye time being as it is so near spent.

With this answer, the King was satisfied: and since that Francisco de
Alburquerque could have no more Pepper then that he had, which was but a small
quantity, he determined to depart toward Portingale, but first he would
nominate him that should remain in the Indias for Captain general, that the
King of Coching should understand the same. And for that he knew, that he that
was appointed, would think it very dangerous to remain there, with so few men
as he was able to leave him, he durst commit it to none of his Captains.
Howbeit after that he had offered the same to them all, and they were not
willing to accept it, Edwarte Pacheco appointed Captain general for the Indias*
last of all he gave the government to Edwarte Pachecho, who did accept it with
a great good will, more for to serve God and his king, then for any profit he
knew that he should get in remaining in the Indias.

And when it was once spread abroad and known to the king of Coching, that
Edwarte Pacheco was he that was appointed, he was well pleased therewith, for
that he had heard before of his valor. This being concluded upon, Francisco
de Alburquerque made sail, carrieng with him all the rest of the Fleet. But
first he gave the king to understand that he did carry the same no further then
to Cananor, for because of the Fleet of Calycut, which might encounter with
him, and so work him some displeasure in his Port, where he minded to stay (as
he did) procuring the liberty of Rodrigo Reynel and the others that were
there. This determination being known to the King of Calycut, he sent him
word, that it were not requisite that he should have him away, but rather
offered him, if so be that he would tarry, to give him the Pepper that he had
promised to deliver. But hearing this, he supposed that he gave the same out,
that Rodrigo Reynel with the others, should be the more desirous to remain in
the Indias. At this instaunt came in Alonso de Alburquerque which returned
from Coulan, and the time being spent, he would not tarrye there any longer,
but with the rest went toward Cananor. And being there arrived, there came a
letter from Rodrigo Reynel, in the which he wrote unto him, that the King of
Calycut was certainly bent to set upon Coching, immediately after that he were
gone. And that all those dissimulations which he did use in offering to give
him Pepper, was but for fear he had conceived that he would have burnt his
ships, which were as then in his harbor. This news the Captain general kept
close to himself, that the same should not come to ye ears of Edwarte Pacheco,
unto whom was left the ship in the which he went, and two Caruells, of the
which were Captains Pedro Raphael and Diego Pieres, besides a ship boat.

Also they left him four score and ten men, and those whole, that were
needful, for all the rest were sick. Also, there was left him, the most part
of the Ordinance, with the most part of the munition that they were able to
spare. Now being known to them all, of the great power that the King of
Calycut had in a readiness, they did then marvel, that Edwarte Pacheco would
accept the same, in especially, for that he remained with so small a Fleet.
Some therefore there were that gave out and said, God have mercy upon Edwarte
Pacheco, and those that do remain with him: supposing that in very deed, he
should not escape.

And although these words were spoken within his hearing, hearing, yet for all
that he would not but tarry. The Captain General being dispatched, did
depart toward Portingale, the last of Ianuarye, in the year of our Lord
1504. 1504*


The first that made sail was Alonso de Alburquerque, They depart from the
Indias and sail toward Portingal*
Francisco de Alburquerque, and Nicholas Coello that departed afterward, were
cast away, Pedro de Taide was driven to Quyloa, and entering upon the Bar,
his Ship was there cast away, with the most part of his men, by means
whereof he went to Monsanbique in a Zanbuco, where afterward he dyed. He
left there a Letter written of all his success, and also declaring in what
estate the Indias did remain, which he commanded to be delivered to any
Captain that should come thither from Portingale.

Alonso de Alburquerque, and Antonio del Campo came to Lishborne the three and
twenteeth of August, in the year above said, and told the King of the estate
of the Indias, who also presented him with four hundred weight of the great
seed of Pearls, which is called Alhofer or Rags, and with 144. pound
weight of great Pearl, of great estimation, and eight Oysters, in the which
the same do grow: and also a Diamond Tablet, the which was as big as a great
Bean, besides many other jewels, and also two horses out of Persia, the which
were great runners.

How Edwarte Pacheco behaved himself in Cananor, and in his course toward
Coching: and what else he past with the king at his arriual. chap. 64.
FRancisco de Alburquerque being departed toward Portingale, Edwarte Pacheco
which remained for Captain General in the Indias, having a while stayed in
Cananor to take in there his victualles, brought himself under sail, and came
to an Ankor without the point of Cananor, and from thence he sent Pedro
Raphaell to go a long the Coast, and to cause all such Ships as he could
discrye to bear with the Captain, and to reknowledge him for their General.
At this instaunt was Diego Pieres a new rigging of his Caruell in Coching. And
all these Ships that were brought before the General, gave an account
whether they were bound, and what they carried, and also of whence they were.
And if so be that he found any Pepper, he would take the same, as he did
from some other ships that were bound to Calycut, in the which order he used
such rigor, that afterward he was feared of all men.

Whilst he was thus at an Ankor, there came upon him in the night a Fleet
of twentye and five Sail of Ships, which upon a sodeine made him to
conjecture that they were of Calycut. And seeing himself in such danger, he
commanded to let slip their Gabells by their Halsis, for that upon such a
sodeine they could not weye their Ankors with their Capsteines, and with the
same he cut and made his course into the Sea, to bring himself in the wind of
those Sails, upon whom he commanded to shoot off all his Ordinance. And
as they were ships laden with Rice, so ran they their way as fast as they
could. Some there were that ran a ground, and more hurt had been done, had
it not been for a great ship of the Moors that came in their company, A
valiant skirmish with an hot ship of the Moors.
in the which were well near to the number of 400. Moors, that were of the
kingdom of Cananor. These thinking that they might take our ship, came
sodeinly upon them, always shooting of their arrows, and we aunswering them
likewise with our Ordinance. This skirmish continued till it was almost day,
and then they told what they were. After that Edwarte Pacheco had thus well
beaten him with his Ordinance, with the which were nine of his men slain,
besides many that were hurt, they told what they were.

And for that there durst not pass any Ship by for fear that they should be
taken, the Captain General departed toward Coching, and in the way he
fought with certain ships of the Moors, some he burnt, and others he took,
beside those that were sunk. Thus with great victory he arrived at Coching,
and landed at the Castle, where he vnsterstoode by the Factour, that the news
of the preparation that the king of Calycut had made for the wars was most
true, and that the king of Coching stood in great fear thereof, for that the
Moors that were inhabitants of Coching, were against their king for the
mainteining of these wars against the king of Calycut. The next day following
the Captain General went to visit the king of Coching, carrieng his boats
with him well armed and fenced, with certain paueises made of Boordes, and
set with Flagges, besides certain Ordinance which they had in the same,
with the which he showed himself to be very joyful, the rather that the king
might take occasion to be merry: who after that he understood how small a
fleet there was left to defend his country withal, he could not be but
very pensatiue, What great fear ye king of Coching was put into by his
traitorous subjects.
and said unto the Captain General, that the Moors of Coching had told
him that he did not remain in the Indias to defend him from the king of
Calycuts power, but to gather together the Merchaundise that were in the
Factorye in Coching, and in the Factors custody, with all those that were
there, and so to carry them all to Cananor and Coulan.

And therefore he earnestlye requested him to tell him if it were so or not,
for he did think the same to be true, by reason that there was left so small
a Fleet. Which the rather also made him to doubt that he would not tarry to
fight with the king of Calycuts power, but would do as the Moors had told
him, wherefore he prayed him to advertise him of the truth thereof, for that
if it were so, he might in time seek his revenge, although as then he should
hardlye find the same, since he had no further help. The Captain General
perceiving the distrust that the king had, was offended therewith, and
answered him, saying.

I Do much marvel of thee (considering that thou have so great experience of
the fidelity of the Portingales) that thou do ask me whether I do remain
for so traitorous an act, The aunsvvere which the Captain General made to ye
king of Coching.
as this is, that in such a time I should do as the Moors have told thee, and
thou will believe them, knowing that they are so greatly our enemies. Thinking
that thou understanding of this, should not bring in question such a matter
out of all reason. And if so be that Francisco de Alburquerque would have done
any such thing, it had been a great deal better that he with all his Captains
had done it, and not have left me alone to do the same, and to run in
danger, and to meet on the seas with so great a fleet of the kings of
Calicut, for them to set upon me only. And if it were so that I should have
remained for to have done so foul a deed, yet I would have told thee
thereof, that I had so meant to do, for that I was afearde of the king of
Calycuts power. But for that I do take thee to be a man endued with reason, I
did suppose that thou would not have thought ill thereof. For otherwise
those being warned thereof, it might have been very profitable unto thee, to
have remained free from the envy and malice of the king of Calicut. Which
thing if so be that the Moors had considered of, they would not have told
thee so great a fable. Believe me, if they could have done thee a greater
injury, they would have done it, for the good will thou do bear unto us.
This I do know very well, but let not that trouble thee. For although thou
do loose them, and all the rest of thy subjects, yet thou do recover me,
and as many Portingales as here remain, who all will die in thy service if it
were need, for that is the only cause we did remain in the Indias, and in
especially: for there was no man that bound me thereunto, if so be y^ I would
not, but only the fidelitye and truth which thou have always used toward our
men until such time as thou did loose Coching, and did see the same
burnt. For the which cause thou ought to esteem the better of thy self,
for thereby thou have exalted thy fame through all the Country, and therefore
thy name will remain for ever, which is the greatest treasure that kings can
leave behind them, and the only thing that all men do seek for. And believe
me, when the king of Calycut did first set fire to Coching, the same was his
destruction, which was afterward well revenged upon thine enemies by the
Portingales, and so thou shall now be as well defended by them. And although
thou do think us to be few and a small Fleet, yet I do promise thee,
that very shortly we will seem to be very many by our valyantnesse. And I
hope in God that we shall so defend whatsoever straight or passage the king of
Calycut shall enter into, A fevv valiant men are better the^ many more naked
and cowardly*
where assuredly we will tarry and not remove our selves from thence, neither
night nor day, and for the passages that are straight, our army is enough,
and therefore it skilleth not, there remain no more for the rivers, for that
these are sufficient. And since that they chose me to remain, believe
certainly that they did well know they left him that shall excuse thee of thy
travail, and of the wearieng of thy men. And therefore be thou merry and
resolve thy self (that by Gods grace) it shall not happen now unto thee as
heretofore it did, when thou did loose Coching: for I and these that do
remain with me shall take upon us the whole charge and danger of the wars.

How the Moors of Coching prepared to go from thence: and how the captain
General stayde certain of them that they should not depart, and what more he
did. chap. 65.
THe king being with this, somewhat eased and recomforted, touching that the
Moors had told him, the Captain general went to see the streights, and to
fortify them, which had great need thereof. But they all were well furnished,
saving only the foord, which he commanded to be fortified with stakes, that
there might enter no vessels of the enemies. In the mean time he was
advertised by a Letter from Rodrigo Reynel, that a principal Moore of Coching,
and besides diverse others, did procure all that they could to leave the city,
that ye king might remain alone, and that thereupon this Moore has come twice
to speak with the king of Calycut in his own behalf, and in the name of the
others. This news troubled the Captain General a while, howbeit to
disappoint them of their subtle dealing, and that the same should take no
effect, he thought it necessary to execute this principal Moore, that the
others might conceive some fear thereof. This being known to the king of
Coching, he would not consent thereunto, thinking that if so be that he were
executed, the others would make a mutenie immediately, and then there should be
no victuals brought into the city, for that those did provide the city
therewith in trucke of their merchandise, and therefore he thought best to
dissemble with them all. The Captain General seeing that the king would not
consent thereunto, told him that he would talk with the Moors himself, and
that he had thought to use some policy that none of them should depart out of
the city. But first he commanded all his own men to obey him in all such
occasions as should be needful or requisite, which commandment the king also
gave out amongst his subject: this being done, the Captain general went with
forty of his men to Coching, to the house of this principal Moore called
Belinamacar, who dwelt hard by the river side, requesting him to send for
certain Moors which he did name, for y^ he would consult with them upon a
certain matter which did concern them all.

To whom the Moors came immediately, for that they were afeard of him, and when
he saw them all, he said unto them.

I Did send for you all, The generals Oration to the Mores concerning his abode
in the Indias.
honest Merchants, that you should understand, wherefore and for what cause I
remained in the Indias, for that it is possible that all you do not know. Some
there be that do report that I do remain to gather together the Factorie, and
so to carry the same to Coulan, and to Cananor: but that you may understand it
is not so, I will therefore tell you the truth. I do remain for no other
purpose but only to keep Coching, and if so be that it were needful or
requisite, to die my self, and all those that do remain with me, in your
defense, in preserving you from the king of Calycut. And this shall be manifest
unto him, if so be that he do come, for I promise you all, that I will meet
with him in the way of Cambalan, whereas it is told me he will enter, and if so
be there he dare fight with me, I will not doubt but to take him prisoner, and
carry him with me into Portingale. Wherefore until such time, as you do not
see any thing to the contrary, I earnestly request you that you do not go
from Coching, for that I hear that you are minded to go from thence, and that
you do allure the residue of the inhabitants with you, for as you are the
chiefest and principalls, so all the common sort of people does follow you. Now
I marvel much y^ being men of so great wisdom as you are, you will leave your
houses in the which you were borne, and the country wherein you have dwelt so
many years, not for fear of any thing that you have seen, but only of that
which you hear, which thing for women to do were very ill, much more for you
that are men. How fevv Portingals have vanquished thousa^ds of therr enemies.
But if so be that you would go, when you shall seem in danger, or else run
away, I would not blame you, but to go away before you have seen any of
these dangers, or any battle fought, I account the same, either cowardice,
or else malice. You do well know, that in a manner yesterday, how few
Portingales did give the overthrow to thousands of our enemies, which now also
come to seek us out. And if so be that you will allege, that we were more in
number then we are now, indeed it is so, for then we fought in open field,
where it was necessary there should be many: and now in a narrow way, where
a few shall do as much as though were many more. And since that I can fight,
as you have well heard of the same, for that I have been he that have done most
hurt to our enemies (as the king of Coching is a good witness thereof) I never
mean to yield, who shall loose more then you all, if I be overcome. Have ye
therefore a sure hope in me, and in those that remain with me, and tarry
until such time you may see the success of all things that we do look for,
and since that your king does tarry, why will ye go your way? Remember that
I and the others that do remain with me, do soiourne in the Indias so far
from our Country, to defend the king of Coching, and you that are his subjects
and naturally borne in the Country. Will you then forsake him and your
country? It were great shame for women so to do, much more for honest men as
you are. I do desire you that you do not dishonor your selves, nor yet do to
me so great an injury, in having no confidence that I will defend you: for I
do give unto you all my word, that I will defend you from a greater power then
any the king of Calycut can make. For therefore and for this cause was I
chosen, and those that did appoint me to remain in the Indias, did know of the
wars that the king of Calycut intended, and what power he had, in respect
whereof I do once again request you, An hard thretning but polytike and
necessary.
to believe that the king of Calycut shall never set his foot in Coching.
Wherefore I desire you that none of you do remove, for whosoever does
otherwise shall well understand, that if so be I may take him I will hang him,
and so I swear by my law. And moreover I give you to understand, that none
of you all shall escape, for here in this port I do mind to tarry, watching
both day and night. Now therefore let every one of you look to that which shall
behoue him, and if so be you do perform that which I have requested you, do
you then assure your selves to have me for your friend, and if not, for your
mortal enemy, and more cruel then you would wish me to be to the king of
Calycut. And therefore each of you, speak plainly your mind what you will do
herein.

This being spoken, it gave him occasion to increase his cholar, that without
any consideration thereof, he did speak so loud, that the Moors with the
same did double their fear, that they had conceived of him, fearing indeed
that immediately he would have hanged them all. Wherefore presently they began to
excuse themselves, touching that he charged them with all, but he would not
tarry the hearing of the same, to the intent to put them in greater fear, but
sent immediately for his Ship, causing it to be brought to an Ankor, hard over
against Coching, besides one of the Caruells, and two of the boats, which he
appointed forthwith to be set in such order, that there could none go out of
Coching by water, but must needs be seen.

He had also many Paraos, which he had caused too be newly rigged, with the
which in the night, he watched in the rivers, which run round about the
city. Also at Sunsetting he would take all the boats that could carry men or
stuff, and command the same to be brought a boorde his ship, and to keep the
watch, and in the morning he returned them to their owners. With this diligence
they of Coching were so feared, that there was none y^ durst go forth without
his lisence, and by means of those extremities used, the Moors and Gentiles
were quiet, yet for all these troubles that the Captain General had, the most
part of the night he would venture a land into Repelyn, in the which he burnt
towns, killed men, and took great store of Cattle and Paraos, and also did
them sundry other injuries, at the which the Moors of Coching much meruailed,
they call ye Captain General a Devil.
namely, how he could suffer so great travail, and therefore they gave out,
that he was the devil.

How the Captain General made an entry into Repelyn, and also how he
departed toward the straights of Cambalan, there to tarry the king of
Calicuts coming. Chap. 66.
AT this instant was the king of Coching advertised that the king of Calicut
was come to Repelin, to gather his power together, and so to go from thence to
Coching by the straights of Cambalan. After ye self same manner did Rodrigo
Reinel, write unto him, who lay as then very sick, and afterward dyed, which
the king of Calycut hearing, commanded to be taken all that he had. This being
known to the Moors of Coching that the king of Calycut was in Repelyn, they
would have given occasion to the towns men to have run away, but there was
none that durst venture to do it, for fear of the Captain General. Who
after that he knew for certeintye of his being in Repelyn, and that all men
might understand how little he did esteem the king of Calycut and his power,
and army of ships, did one night set upon a town of the country of Repelyn,
at such hours when all were a sleep, and did set fire to the same. And after
that it was well kindled, our men were known, and immediately there came many
Naires, The captain general and his men enforced to retire unto their boats.
as well of the town, as also from other places thereabouts adjoining. The
Captain General was forced to retire, and that with great danger, unto his
boats, with five of his men hurt, and of his enemies there were many slain and
hurt, and yet for all that, those enemies that remained alive, followed him a
good while. And as our men returned toward Coching, there were shot by them so
many arrows which fell upon their boats, that their targets were all covered
with the same.

This being known to the king of Coching, that he was come to the Castle, he
went to visit him, for that he accounted that enterprise for a great matter, in
especially the king of Calycut being there present, who had in a readiness so
great and mighty a power, and so he said. At the which the Captain General
laughed, and therewithal he told him that he would desire no more but that
the King of Calicut would once come, for that he would fight with him a
battle, and then would be apparaunt the valiantness of his men. They of
Coching being now all quiet, as also the Captain general having made unto the
principals an Oration, he prepared his men in a readiness for that he minded
to depart to the straights of Cambalan. And in the mean while he left in the
ship xxv. men with the master, which was called Diego Perrera, whom he left
for Captain in his absence, and also as well furnished with Ordinance and
shot, that they might defend themselves the better. The names of those that
tarried with him I do omit, as also those that remained in the Castle. Those
that the Captain General carried with him, were to the number of xxiiii. men:
and in one of the boats he appointed for Captain, him that went for Captain
in the Caruell Santa Maria, whiles she was a rigging, with xxii. men. The
captain General went in another boat, in the which with himself there were
one and twenty men. Amongst them all their number was lxxiii. men, who all
both those that were in the Caruell, and those that were in the boats, being
all confessed, and having received the Sacrament, the Captain General
departed to the straights of Cambalan, 1504*
on the Friday before Palms Sunday, being the xvi. of April. 1504. These
words the Captain General speak unto ye king at his departure to wards the
passage.
Thus departing with great pleasure, and with shooting of their Ordinance,
leaping, and dancing, when they came over against Coching, the General landed
to talk with the king, which was tarrieng for his coming by the water side,
so heavy and so sad, that he could not hide the same. The Captain General
making as though he understood nothing of it, said unto him: that thee they
were all ready with great pleasure and good will, to depart toward the passage,
to defend him from the king of Calicut, whom they went to seek out, that he
should understand that they had no fear of him. The king smiled at these
words, as it were suspecting his good success. Notwithstanding, he appointed
him 500. Naires (of five thousand which he had in arms) of the which he named
for Captains, Gandagora, and Frangera, which were overseers of his householde,
and Caymal de Palurta, to whom he gave commandment that they should obey
the Captain general as his own person. This being done, the king stood and
viewed all our Fleet, who at that time showed himself to be very heavy, to
see how few we were in comparison of the great power of the king of Calicut,
and upon the same took occasion to speak unto the Captain General, saying.

THere was represent unto him the great danger which he feared might happen
unto him, the words of ye king of Coching to the captain general.
and that which chanced to himself this last year. And therefore do I desire
thee, quoth he, to encourage thy self to do that which thou art able, and not
to suffer thy heart to deceive thee, but to remember how much the king of
Portingale shall loose in loosing thee: and with those words his eyes stood
full of water, which to see, the Captain General was very sorry, and said
unto him. The annsvvere the captain general made to ye king of Coching.


That better are a few and valiant, then a great multitude and cowards. And
whether (said he) our men be valiant or not, your self have well seen, and
also how contrariwise it fares with the enemies, your self likewise have had
experience. He inferred also how in that place where he minded to tarry for
his coming, theere needed but a few to defend him. And therefore he prayed him
for to be content, and therewith he departed, and came to the passage of
Cambalan, two hours before day, where finding no sign of the coming of the
king of Calycut, he went in the mean while, and did set upon a town of the
self same Island of the Caimalls, where in the dawning of the day he arrived
in the Harbor, a long the which there was appointed. 800. Nayres to keep the
same, which were Archers, and a few with their Caleeurs, which were there
tarying for him. And although those with their calyuers, and the residue with
their arrows, shot of at our men, in such manner that they seemed to shadow the
Element, yet with the paueices of our boats, the which were made of boards of
two fingers thick, much like unto Targets or shields, we did so defend them
of, that they were driven to row toward the land, which was done for that those
yt were there should give place, yt our men might leap a land. Then ye Captain
general commanded his ordinance to be shot of, with y^ which they lept a land:
howbeit, ye enemies returned upon them, and therein showed themselves to be
valiant, for ye space of an hour. But afterward they fled apace, and many of
the^ in the conflict, at yt present were both slain and hurt at our men's hands.
But after that our men had set fire to the town, and the same was well
kindled, the captain general did retire, and going toward the passage, in
their way they took and killed much cattle which they carried with them: and
although the people of the country did defend themselves very well, yet our men
being come to the passage of Cambalan, the Caymall sent to make peace with the
captain general, with a certain present, which he would not receive, neither
yet make peace with him, for that he was an enemy unto the king of Coching.
Whereupon the next day after, the king of Calycut sent him word that he would
give him the battle, Here the battle was offered by the king of Calicut
unto the captain General.
and also that he was greatly offended that he had placed himself where he did
mind to enter. And moreover, it was told him that they did all affirm, that
the king of Calycut was like to give him the overthrow and to take him
prisoner, or else to kill him in the battle.

To the which the captain general answered, that the self same hope he had
to do by the king, the rather in honor of the day, which was a solemn feast
amongst the Christians, adding moreover yt his wytchys had disappointed and
deceived him much, to promise him the victory in such a day. Then a certain
Nayre which came with this Messenger, hearing the Captain general say so,
answered him, and that with a smiling countenance, as though he had mocked
him, that there were very few men to do y^ which he spoke of: and also y^ the
king of Calicuts men were so many, y^ they were sufficient to cover the whole
earth and the water. Which if it be so, how (said he) can they be overcome.
With this answer y^ Captain general was greatly offended, and for that he
was thought to be one of the king of Calicuts Nayres, he boxt him well, willing
him to bid the kings of Calicut revenge the same. With the which the others
that came with the message, were so greatly afraid, that they never durst
afterward avouch the king of Calicut.

That same evening the King of Coching sent to aid the Captain General with
five hundred Nayres, of the which he made no account, nor of the others before,
for that he knew they would all run away. In our men, next under God, he had
his confidence and whole trust, who all that night made great feast, that
the king of Calicut might understand that they did not fear him, but rather
showed great forwardnes to give him y^ battle, of the which ye Captain
general was very glad. And therefore before it was day, The captain generals
words spoken unto his me^.
he spoke unto al his men in this manner. Masters and my friends, for the great
content that I do find in you. I do for most certain prognosticate the great
gift yt God in his service will give unto us this day. And I do believe for most
certain, that as God has given us stomach (being so few as we are) to dare
tarry and abide so many thousands of men as there are of our enemies: so he will
give us force and strength to resist them, and herein will show his great power,
and as it were a miracle so great as this is, in ye exalting of his holy
faith: and in his holy name I do desire you, that you will so believe, for yt
without this hope, although we were as many as the enemies are, and they as few
as we be, yet all our strength were nothing, and being in this hope, all the
multitude of the enemies will seem unto us but few to over come: for they do
judge us to be many more then we are, their fear is such. And this also you
may believe, that if their coming as at this day with their great presumption
be, for that they are many, having most assured hope to take us, yet they will
have a fear from hence forth, so that their spirits will be broken, to set
upon us any more, which thing if they did, it would be more for fear of the
king of Calycut, then for any good zeal they have unto him. And therefore I
pray you remember, that with this confidence you must fight, and God shall give
you the victory, and that with honor of all the Portingales, and a perpetual
fame amongst the strangers, and deserts before our king, that he may reward
you for the same, whereby you shall the better maintain your selves all the
days of your life.

Unto these words they all answered, that in the battle he should well see
how well they did remember his speech. And immedialy they fell upon their knees
and sung the Salve regina in tune, and afterward an Aue Maria with a loud
voice. At this present came Larenco Moreno from the Castle, who brought with
him four of his Caleeuer men, for they would needs exercise themselves in this
battle. The Captain General was very glad of their coming, for that they
were very valiant.

How the king of Calycut gave battle unto the Captain General in the
straights of Cambalan, and how he had the overthrow. chap. 67.
THis night by the persuasion of the Italian runagates, the king of Calycut
commanded to be made a plat-forme or s^once, on the which there might be
placed five pieces of Ordinance, the which might stand right over against where
the Captain General was, that from thence they might shoot off their
ordinance, at what time they meant to give the onset, and for that the
straightness of the passage was a danger unto him. So on Palms sunday the
king of Calycut marched forward, with xlvii. thousand men, the which were as
well of the Naires as of the Moors: besides that he went accompanied with the
king and Caimalls, which were come unto him, to aid and succor him, not
only with their own persons, but also with their men. That is to say, the
king of Tanor with four thousand Nayres: The kings and Caimals that assist the
king of Calicut against the Portingales.
the king of Bybar, and of Curran, which is hard by the Mountains of Narsinga,
with twelve thousand Nayres: the king of Cotogataco, which stands between
Cananor and Calicut, hard by the Mountains, with eighteen thousand Naires:
The king of Cur^a, which is between Panane and Grangalor, with three thousand
Naires: Also Nabeadarin, which was Prince of Calycut and Namboa his brother,
and the king of Calycut himself, who had a great number, which for that they
were many, I do not rehearse. The sorts of instruments that they had for the
wars were so many and diverse, that when they began to play upon the same, it
was thought that heaven and earth would join together. Over and besides the
great multitude of the people, the which did cover the whole earth. Those that
went in the vangard, as soon as they came to their settling, did give fire to
their ordinance, which as they lay near to the Caruel, so it appeared partly a
miracle, that there was no piece that did hurt it. Howbeit our Ordinance being
shot off, did all light full amongst the enemies, and killed many of them,
although it was before day, the which until Sun did rise, were in
discharging out of the Caruell, above xxx. pieces.

After all this, the whole Fleet of the enemies began to come out of the
rivers of Repelyn, which were 169. Foystes, that is to say, three score and
six Paraos, the which had their defense of sackes of Cotton, which devise
was given them by the Italians, that our Ordinance should not hurt their men.

Each of their boats or Paraos had two pieces of Ordinance in them, and five
and twenty men, of the which there were five in every Parao that had their
Caleeuers, and all the rest were bow men.

Also there were twenty of these Foysts, all cheined together, for to set upon
the Caruell. Also there were liii. Catures, beside thirty great Barks, each
of these had his piece of Ordinance, and sixteen men, which served in him
with sundry kinds of weapons.

Besides all these armed vessels, there went other furnished with men, which
being all together, it seemed that the whole river was covered over, in the
which Fleet were well near x. thousand men, and of this fleet was Admerall
Nabeadarin, and for Vice Admerall the Lord of Repelyn. Certainly to see them
altogether upon the water and land, was a great terror, all of them being
half naked, some of color black, and others of a dark Tawnye. And upon
their weapons the Sun did so glister, that they appeared as though they had
been swoordes, and newly ground, and so likewise did their targets, the which
were of sundry colors, and showed very gallant. And for that our men should
stand in the more fear of them, they gave out great cries and laroms. After
this they began to sound upon their instruments of war, which noise
continued always, now after one sort, and then after another.

Our men bearing amongst such a multitude, and being in their Caruell and
their boats, could scarcelye be discerned, for with the Fleet, they
occupied almost all the passage, by means of ropes they gave the one the
other, which ropes were wound about with cheynes, that they should not cut
them a sunder. And after that they had done this, commandment was given, to
give fire to the Ordinance, with the which the enimyes were received. The
Naires of Coching do all run away*


At this instaunt those Nayres that were of Coching did all run away, only
Grandagora and Frangora remained for that they were in the Caruell: otherwise
they would have gone as the others did, which had been no matter, but that
they should see how valiantly our men defended themselves in the battle, into
the which they went in a great heat.

The Ordinance went off so often, and likewise the small shot, that there was
none that could see one another, for the smoke of the same. The Caruell and
the Boats did so flame in fire, and did so cruelly handle the enimyes at the
first entering, that there were torn in pieces some of their Paraos, and many
of their men slain and hurt, without any of ours hurt, or standing in any
danger thereof at all. By this time, the enimyes were come, within the throw
of a Dart. Howbeit, as they were many, and that without order, the one did hurt
and hinder the other, so that they could not fight. Yet notwithstanding, the
xxv. Paraos that went before, did trouble our men very much with their
Ordinance which they had, for that they went cheined together.

Our men being wearied and hurt, and the battle having endured a good while,
the Captain General commanded a Saker to be shot at them, The enemies
utterly discomfited, do run their way.
the which till that time had not been shot at the enemies. And after that the
same was twice discharged, they all fled, and for that they lay very thick
together, it did immediatlye sink four of them, and with that they were all
overcome, and so they ran their way. The residue of the Paraos which did
continue in the battle, were eighteen sunk, and thirteen fled away, the
residue gave place, in the which there were of the enimyes great numbers
slain and hurt.

After all this came the Vize Admerall called the Lord of Repelyn, with another
squadron, and gave a proud onset, so did the king of Calycut give the like upon
the land. This battle was far more vehement then the first, in the which
were many more of the enimyes slain, then before, as appeared by the water
which was of the color of blood. Yet for all this, the Lord of Repelyn made
loud outeryes, commanding them to lay the Caruell aboorde, but for all that
they durst not venture to do it, but rather were desirous to go their way,
as they also that were a land did the like.

It was now at this present past Euensong, from the time the battle did first
begin, in the which were of the enymies slain, not only by land, but also
by water. 350. men, which were known, besides others, the which were above a
thousand: and of our men there were some hurt, but none slain. And although
their pellets were made of cast iron, yet they did no more hurt, then a stone
being thrown. Howbeit, our defenses were all torn in pieces, and one of our
boats also, nevertheless, not in such sort, but that it might be new rigged
before that it was night.

How the king of Calicut seeing the ill success that he had in the wars,
did enter into council to leave the same. Chap. 68.
THose kings and noble men which came to succor and aid the king of Calicut,
perceiving that he was thus overthrown, and that with great loss both of his
men and vessels, although his power were great, and ours but very small, and
that the captain General never made any reckoning of the king of Calicut nor
of his force, but for all that did ouerrun the Country, and destroyed it, some
there were of them that made a great wonder thereat, and said that our God did
fight for us, whereupon they lost all the hope they had for ever to give us the
overthrow, and from thence forth they had themselves in no reputation, but
rather were very sorry that it was their evil hap to come in the aid of the
king of Calycut. Those that did most repent themselves of their coming, were
subjects to the king of Coching, for that their countries were situated along
the rivers, which did put them in the more fear of the Captain General, that
he would set fire to their towns and houses, or otherwise destroy them. And
for that cause, they determined to leave the king of Calycut, and would make no
more wars against our men, more the^ that which was past already.

And upon this condition, they returned to the king of Coching, with whom they
reconcyled themselves, and those that did thus were, one called Marugata, Muta
Caymal, and his brother, and Cousins, who immediately after the battle, did so
secretly depart from the king of Calicuts Camp, from whence they went to the
Island of Vaypin, to stay there, till they might see their time, as I have said.
But when the king of Calicut had knowledge that they were gone, The king of
Calicut much blames his captains for being overthrown by so fevv*
and also understood where they were become, he was very sorry therefore, which
also was the occasion that he renewed all his grief, that he had conceived
for his overthrow, which he had received at our men's hands, that were so few.
Whereupon he took occasion to rebuke his captains, saying, that they were good
for nothing, and that through their defaulte our men continued and kept these
passages. And if so he, that they had had any shame, they would or this time
have driven them from thence, in especially having given so often the
enterprise to pass the same. Then those two Italians that were present, did
reply unto the king, that although our men had done most valiantly, yet that
which they did was like unto the deeds of desperate men. Notwithstanding, that
they were not able to defend themselves long, from such a power as his was, in
especially, not hoping to have any succor. And therefore they willed him to
set upon them often times, for by that means it was possible to take them.
Some also of those kings and noble men that came to succoure the king, and
that were desirous of wars, did confirm that which the Italians had said
before, addinge moreover, that God does permit his enemies sometime to have
the victory, for a more greater loss unto them, and therefore it were good
said they, that he followed his friends counsel, and proved their
steadfastness. And although it were so, that he had not the victory
immediatelye, yet he should not therefore despair. The king finding himself
somewhat vexed in mind with those words, answered them saying. Although that
each of you is so valiant, that it appears unto you, the kings aunsvvere unto
this advice.
a small matter to overcome those Christians, yet I am not so obstinate to
think the same. Howbeit I suppose yet, that you do see in me no such a fear,
that thereby you might judge it needful, to strengthen me with those words.
For what can you tell me in this case, that you may satisfy me withal? For if
so be, that you will consider as much as I do, you would soon know, how
great an act this is, that you do make so little account off. I do not take
it in us for so great a victory in ouercomming these Christians, but rather in
them, in defending themselves from us, as they have done. Where in it has well
appeared, No doubt but God does fight for his servants*
that their God did fight for them.

And will you see how it is so? You may well consider, that our men are many,
and that they have been valyant in the wars past, it has well appeared in
many and great battles, wherein I have overcome mine enemies, as you do all
well know. But since they have fought with these Christians, they seem to be
(not as they were) nor durst give the onset upon them, for the fear they have
conceived. And certainly, as far as I can learn, and also all those that are
of a good judgment, we ought to believe, that those works are rather of God,
then of man. For who is he that would not be afeard of them, well perceiving
that all others are? I mean not only the King of Cochings subjects which came
to succor us, who have repented themselves thereof, but also many other of
our friends, which in the beginning of these wars did also aid us.

And farther, I am informed by some, that they have now offered their
friendship unto the King of Coching. Which thing, if it be true, it is for that
they have lost the hope they had of any victory on our part, as well for that
which is past, as also reputing how little time there is now left of the
Summer, and also for that in the Winter they cannot remain any time to
continue in the Fields, because of the great storms and rain, which would
then be.

And in the end of the winter, then will there come the Fleet from
Portingale, which will do us as much harm as the fleet did the last year,
and so I shall never be out of unfortunate mischiefs, but thus in the end I
shall be utterly destroyed.

All this shall be that I shall get, with the loss of the friendship of the
Christians. And it is possible that for their causes the Pagodes will not aid
nor help me as they have done before time. For although you tell me, that they
do permit sometime their friends to suffer persecution for their profit, God
chasticeth me^ sometime for their trial sometime for their offenses.
do you not think the same also to happen for their offenses, as it is well
known this does for mine. What then shall need any further exhortations, to
cause me to do as you would have me, and to suffer persecution for my wealth,
since I do understand what the same means: and for the preserving of mine
estate, it is requisite and needful to have friendship with the Christians,
if so be that you be also of the same mind, for that we are all equal in the
loss, and also in the gains.

For this talk of the kings, they were all sorry that had given him counsel
to go forward in these wars, since that they perceived that his intent was to
leave the same, and have friendship with the Captain General. These therefore
would forthwith have answered, but the Prince Nabeadarin did prevent them,
who was sorry for these wars commensed, and spoke thus looking upon them
all.

SInce the king does ask us counsel what is best to be done in this matter,
The Princes Oration unto the King and Nobles assembled*
which stands him so much upon, I as one that most of all am grieved with
this loss, and most desirous of his profit, will therefore be the first that
shall show herein my mind, and what I do think thereof. In that which you
say, that oftentimes the Pagodes in the time of the persecutions that we do
receive will command us to do that which they will have us, so we ought to
understand them, although therefore in these wars it appears that it goes
very evil with us, and in this they do show how much they are our friends,
truly I do believe the same, the rather for that we ought not to believe them
that would have a matter done without reason, as it were to give us the
victory against those Christians, and power to destroy the king of Coching,
unto whom we have done very much hurt, killynge the last year his Princes and
almost all his men, setting of Coching a fire, and destroying his country,
from whence we hunted him away, with his great discredit, dispossed him of his
kingdom and subjects, so that al they for the fear they had of us did leave
him, yea his own friends forsook him, and went against him, and all for our
sake. And above all these evils the which he did not deserve, for yt he was not
in any fault, we would yet proceed further, utterly to destroy him. What has
he done? Did he procure to take any man's country from him? No. In friendship
did he use himself traitorously? Neither. Did he command the Marchantes that
they should not come to Calicut? Neither, Did he the^ some worse thing since he
did nothing of these? Nothing at all. What then? forsooth for yt he did receive
into his country the Christians which being driven out of Calicut, went to
seek him out, as he was desirous to increase and enpeople his City, and to
augment his estate and riches: Shall we therefore destroy him being our friend,
as an enemy? With this right do the Pagodes help us to take the honor,
riches and credit from the right owner? It cannot be so, for that they be
righteous and just, and therefore they will not help us against those Christians
which were slain, robbed, and thrust out of Calicut, and were there received
under safeconduct from the king, coming to his port before any others, and
not giving cause wherefore they should receive so many injuries. If we do it
for that they laid hand upon a Ship of the Moors, there is no reason why,
for that the King commanded them to stay the same: And if he had been advised
by all men as he was by me, the Moors should have paid for that they ha done
and that very well, for and if they had been punished, it would well have appeared,
yt the king had been in no fault of yt which they had done. And this had been
sufficient to have confirmed the friendship of the Christians with him, and
this also would have been a cause sufficient, to have kept them in Calicut from
going to Coching, to have there setteled a trade, whom the King through evil
council has trauayled so much to take them, as though they were thieves that
had robbed him of his own, they being so good, so gentle, so valyant as we
see, Amongst other virtues grate fulness commended.
and besides so grateful of the benefit they do receive. For the receiving
of them as ye King of Mylinde did, they gave over two ships laden with gold,
the which they had taken from a Cousin of his. If these men were Thieves, as
the Moors do say they are, those were prices not to be left. You know how
rich a Present they brought to the King, and what rich merchandise they
brought, and how much gold and silver. Those fishermen which they did carry
away naked, did return again all apparailed. If then we were friends, how
surely should we live: and what profit should the King have, if we had amity
with them. I do not speak of ye ship yt carried y^ Elephants which was given
him: when all y^ prises did pass by these thieves hands, the which they left.
These were services to be thankfully received, giving occasion to us to
gratify the^ in like sort, and to be glad to have them for our friends, and
since we did put them away when they had need of us, now that we have need
of them, let it not be thought evil, to conclude a peace with them, for that
the wars we make against them, we make the same against our selves. They are
upon the Sea of more power then we are, as you may well see the same by the
long time they have defended this passage, and with what power of men, and also
what destruction they have brought upon us, and are like to do, since that
our Country lies near to the water side, and that with our own loss, we
have well seen the truth. Therefore let it go no further, but let us seek some
remedy to have a peace concluded amongst us: for if we have not, ye port or
harbor of Calicut will be utterly undone, and the king will be like to loose all
his rents. This does concern him more then al y^ friendship of ye Moors,
which have no other respect but only to their own profit, and not to the
kings, and these be they that go give council to make these wars.

How the council of the prince Nabeadarin was gainsaid, and how a certain
Moore of Calicut did invent the making of certain castles of timber, with the
which they might lay the caruels abord. ca. 69*
THe king of Calicut all this while gave great ear to y^ which ye prince his
brother had said, and immediately answered yt he was in y^ fault, as touching y^
which was past, and had repented himself to have taken ye enterprise in hand.
And therefore he desired them al, to enter into council with his brother, and to
take some good order for y^ co^cluding of peace with us: which was not well
thought of by y^ Lord of Repelin, for yt he was co^federate with ye Moors to
hinder ye same, The Lord of Repe^^ns aunsvvere to the prince in the (...) house.
and after yt the king had ended his talk, he spoke in this manner following
According as y^ Malabars are constant, so I do well believe, yt from hence
forth they will not have thee in any reputation, if thou should do as thou
say, for yt they would impute y^ same rather to cowardnes, then to any
revelation or forewarning of ye Pagodes. This is a matter not well to be thought
of, much less the^ to be spoken of amongst persons of honor as here are, and
with so great a power, with hope of many more if there were need: for all ye
noble men of y^ Malabars are ready for ye same, having great confidence in thy
valiantness, and therefore did choose thee to be head of this war. And now,
will thou leave ye same without receiving any hurt in thy person, with yt which
thou might excuse the same, not to die in thy demand. But returning whole,
and with many of thine whole, what will they say but yt for ye fear of so few
strangers thou give over y^ thou have begun with so great a heat, and that thou
runnest away not being overcome? With this thou shall loose thy credit y^ thou
had with all men, which since it is so, were thou not better die, then to
live dishonored? I marvel much yt the prince did not consider this, which is y^
principal matter yt he should make rekoning of, as one yt does esteem thine
honor, I yt do also esteem ye same, do not council ye king to give over the
wars, although I should see ye Pagodes command thee, for rather death is to be
wished, then such obedience. Go forwards therefore in these wars, for so ye
Pagodes would have thee do, and do not contrary unto this advise. The
dissimul^ng vvorfs of ye Moors to ye King.
The Moors yr were present hearing all this talk, which was to their content,
did further ye same as much as in the^ lay, setting forward ye king, praising
him to be invincible, laieng before him y^ infamy he should incur, if he did
leave y^ wars: they offered him moreover their persons and goods toward ye
same, alleging ye increasing of his rents with their trade, plenty of
victuals in his city with their being there, declaring also y^ old friendship
they have had with him, and how they were become natural inhabitants of his
country, with many other things, unto y^ which ye king would not answer,
neither yet his brother, for yt al those kings and Lords did help ye Moors
advise, and so it was concluded yt the wars should go forward. And for y^ it had
gone with ye king so evil in y^ foord, they found a new invention to lay the
caruels a board, which a certain Moore of Repelin made called (...), who had been a trauailer, and seen sundry inventions devised. And for y^ cause having a
pregnant wit, he inverted a castle to be made of timber, built upon two boats
or lighters, placing two beams crossewise over ye forepart of the said boats,
and the stern or poope of ye boats to be as broad as ye castle long, yt which
castle was made square, and upon those beams were other placed, so high as as a
chamber from a hall, and in every square were quarters of timber thick set
together, of ye height of a lance, or little less, mortased in ye said beams,
and nailed with great iron nails, and in ye bodies of ye quarters of timber were
holes made, through ye which went bars of iron. so y^ to sight the castle
seemed a strong thing. In this castle might. 40. men be well placed, besides
certain pieces of ordinance, so that in this wise this castle might pass ye
rivers, and with grapuls ioyn with ye caruels, which being do^e ye king desired ye
sight thereof, and when he had seen ye same, did not only praise his wit, but
also rewarded him very largely, and by the same pattern commanded other seven
to be made, that upon them the Caruells might dispend their times, and occupy
themselves, thinking that even so it would be.

Of the great alteration there was in Coching, about these Castles, and what
policy the Captain found to defend the Caruell from them. Chap. 70.
Immediately after, was the Captain general advertised by espies that he had
sent of these castles, and that the enemies were also making in readiness
certain fireworkes, y^ therewith they might burn y^ caruells, and if they could
not burn ye same, y^ then with these castles, they might lay the said Caruel
aboard: As soon as the dwellers and inhabitants of Coching heard of these
castles, they were therewith grealy afeard, least yt the enimyes would take
Coching, and with that did make themselves in a readiness to fly from thence,
for the which the king of Coching was very sad, supposing y^ indeed with these
Castles, his enemies would take his country from him. After this, certain of
the inhabitants of Coching went to ye Captain general, to ask him whether he
was able with his caruells to defend himself from these castles. Whervppon the
Captain answered and asked of them, wherefore they demanded y^ question, seeing
y^ they did well know, that from a greater power then this, he had made them
fly with broken heads, and so he doubted not, but he would do again. With
this answer, ye inhabitants of Coching were fully satisfied, and so minded not
to remove themselves from thence, until such time the battle were fought. The
Captain general for to encourage them the more, A Caluete, and what the
meaning thereof is.
commanded before them all to pitch a long staff in the ground, the which was
made sharp at y^ one end. The same amongst the Malabars is called Caluete, upon
ye which they do execute justice of death: unto the poorest or vilest people of
the country: insomuch y^ if they say to a Naire, Naire Caluete, they take the
same for a greater reproach then any other. This Caluete being pitched on this
sort, the Captain general did then swear, to spit upon the same the king of
Calicut, if so be that he did fight with him, and so forthwith he commanded in
dispraise of the king of Calicut, y^ all his men should say with a loud voice,
Samurin Caluete. At this sight the inhabitants meruailed to see ye stoutnesse
of y^ Captain, and so minded to remain and keep the town. But for all this,
the Captain General was inwardly moved in spirit, for fear yt indeed they
would lay his caruels a board, and that for lack of men. Howbeit ye better to
defend them from ye same, he commanded to be made a certain Caniso, ye which
was made with certain masts of ships, joined the one to the other, and bound
with great bolts and hoops of iron These masts were of eight fathom of length,
and as many of breadth, and were placed from y^ Caruels a good stones throw.
And for y^ the eb nor yet the flood should carry ye same away, there were laid
out six great ankors, three of them upon the flood, and the other upon the eb,
y^ made the same the surer. And for that the Caruels should remain so high as
y^ castles, one Peter Raf^l considering these devises, devised also to
encounter with the height of those castles, to make certain turrets of half
masts, which were set upright, and made fast a board the caruell, in the which
turrets seven or eight men might fight at pleasure in each of them. This being
done, one morning before day there came to visit the Captain general the king of
Coching, of whose coming the Captain was very glad, for yt he had heard how
fearful he was, and therefore he gave him a good countenance, yet for all this,
the king could dissemble no longer, but presently his eyes did run down with
water, and with yt he embraced the Captain general, and commanded those noble
men yt came with him to do ye like, which was done with so sorrowful a
countenance, as though it were y^ last time yt they should meet. Afterward ye
king did apart himself with yt captain and some of our men, and as a man out
of his wits, said unto him. The King of Calycut has a great power, The king of
Cochings words to the Captain general.
and we are but few, and that without any hope that I have to defend Coching,
or any of my people, who besides are ready to run away if thou be overcome.
And since that I am undone, I request thee, that thou do provide for thine
own safety, whilst thou have time, for that afterward, I doubt thou shall
not have the same: and therewith, as though he were stopped in the throat, he
spoke no more.

The Captain general showing himself to be angrye with this speech, The
answer that the captain general made to the King of Coching.
answered him somewhat with cholar, asking him what weakness or cowardnesse
he had seen in him, that he should will him to provide for his safety? And
further said, that there or in what place soever he was, he was most assured to
defend himself from the King of Calicut, and also doubted not but to give him
the overthrow, notwithstanding the great power he brought. And did not thou
tell me (quod he) all these times past, that God did fight for the Portingales,
but now how do thou doubt of the same? I have a hope in God, that to morrow
thou shall see the King of Calycut put in that Caluete, and of this I do not
doubt, if he do tarry me, neither yet thou ought to have any doubt, if thou
would think upon the victories that God has given me so oftentimes, the
King of Calycut having the same advantage that now he has. This thou ought
to believe, and not that which the Moors of Coching do tell thee, for yt they
all do not love us, neither yet the alteration of the Nayres should make thee
apalde, which are afeard of every puff of wind. Repent thy self therefore of
that thou have told me, and despair not, but return with good courage to
Coching, and there also to comfort and harten thy people, show thy self
strengthened, and stay thy subjects from going away, and let me alone with this
Passage, for I will give thee a good account thereof.

The King minding not to increase his cholar, did show himself recomforted
with his words and comfortable answer, trusting that we would defend the
Passage, according to the valiant minds he had found in us, and in our
Captain general: which he did affirm without any doubt of the defense
thereof. The Nayre, and all the people of Coching, upon their alteration and
determination, they made for their departing, believing yet that our men should
be overthrown, did thereupon provoke the Moors to run away, but yet
nevertheless they would not.

How the King of Calycut did give the Battle unto the Captain general with
his castells, and ow they were all overthrown. cap. 71.
THe King of Coching being departed, the Captain general went to his Caruell,
showing himself grieved greatly, to see the King so faint hearted, the which
might be the occasion that Coching might be disinhabited, which he feared very
much: and being desirous to suppe with his men, thither came Lorenso Moreno,
with those of the Factorie, with whom he was accustomed to come, for (as I have
said) there was never any found in the battle of our men, that the enemies
could overcome: The Supper being done, they went to rest themselves till
midnight, and being confessed and absolved by the Vicar, the Captain general
said unto them.

MAsters and my friends, The Captain generals Oration to his company*
I am very merry and glad that you do remember the principal thing, which is
your souls, for that I do well know, that with this remembrance God will
have us in his high and glorious memory, to give us the victory against our
enemies, not only for the satisfaction of our troubles, but also for the
increasing of his holy and Catholic faith and that the King of Coching and his
people might understand, that our God is a true God, and mighty above all
mighties, and that he does not fail those which do put their confidence and
trust in his name. As for the King of Coching, you did well see him yesterdaye
how sad and heavy and without hope he went away (...) in the victory, which
God I doubt not has promised us, making sure account, that we were all lost,
and utterly cast away, persuading me withal* that I should in time provide for
mine own safety. Surely I did never find in him so much fear, nor yet so
great cowardnesse, the occasion thereof was, that they heard that the power of
the king of Calicut was much greater then it was before. And although it were
so great as they do think, yet far greater without al comparison is our
God, and that have you well seen in the helps past that he has sent us, and
even so now do I hope that he will likewise help us and send us the victory.
And with this hope let us assuredly trust to overcome the enimyes, for he will
maintain the honor that we have gotten, and from hence forth will so
increase the same, that we should remain in this world for lights of
valiant men, and for the same be so feared in the Indias, that neither the
king of Calicut nor any else will dare set upon us: and the honor being
gotten, we shall be assured of rest for the troubles we have had.

As he had ended they said all, that without the victory they would not live.
Me^ make wars to the intent to live in peace.
And at this time which was two hours after midnight, some of the Ordinance
of the fleet of the king of Calycut began to discharge, making their way
toward the Captain General: and the king himself went by land, being
accompanied with more then thirty thousand men, with his field pieces, as his
use was, and with great hope ye he should give us the overthrow, and with this
double pride, much more then he ever had, he came forward. The Lord of Repelyn
marched before with certain men that should make rampyres of earth in the
point of Arr^^l, for a defense for our enimyes in the battle. He brought with
him great noises and cries, with great pleasure and dancing, the which the
Captain general did hear, and went very secretly a land, and placed
himself in the very point where the enemies should come, the which he did
defend that the enemies should not make there any rampyers, about the which our
men killed some of them. This being known to the king of Calicut, that the
Captain General came thither to meet with him, he commanded his soldiers
with a stout stomach to set upon him and take him alive, the better to
revenge himself on him at his pleasure. About this there was a great skirmish
and many of the enemies were slain without taking of the Captain General,
neither yet could they make their rampires. As the morning came on which was
the Ascension day, the other Fleet did appear, y^ which was not far off, and
by this, the Captain general was retired unto his boats, but it was with
great trouble, because of the great multitude of the enemies which came upon
him: howbeit he embarked both himself and his men without lacking any of them,
but there were of the enemies many slain and hurt. The point being now clear
and unfurnished, the enemies came and placed themselves there, and then they
began to shoot off their Ordinance at us, to the which we did answer with
ours, doing them great hurt therewith, for that all our shot went amongst the
enemies, where they lay open, and our men were well fenced, therefore their
ordinance could do us no hurt. The king of Calicut being in danger sends
for succor to ye rest of his fleet.
The king of Calicut seeing this, sent word to his Fleet that they should row
a pace, and come to help and deliver him from the danger and fear that our
men did put him in. The Fleet being come, it was a fearful sight to behold
them, for that there was driven before them certain raffes, the which went
always burning, with intent to set the Caruells on fire, and after them an
hundred and ten Paraos full of men and ordinance, and many of them cheined
together, and after them a hundred Catures in the same manner, and four score
Tonis de coxia ancha, and in each of them thirty men, besides their
ordinance, and the eight castles in keeping of these, the which stood hard by
the point, for that the ebb was not as yet altogether entered. The enemies
came with great clamor, making great laromes and cries, and plaieng upon
instruments, accounting us as overcome already, and with this, they shot off so
many pieces of Ordinance as it was wonderful to see, and with their fagots
which they brought before them burning, they drew very near to the Canizo,
which was placed before the Caruells, and therefore they could not come to set
the Caruels a fire, neither any other of all the Fleet. Wherefore, all those
that went before, did join with the Caniz^, and therewith did give us
battle, and without all doubt they had closed with us at this time, if this
defense had not been. In this sudden fight which was very great, the battle
endured a good while, until such time the ebb came on, and at this time the
enemies received great hurt, not only in their Fregates that were torn in
pieces and sunk, but also many of their men that were slain and hurt. The
Ebb being come, the Paraos with their Castles did put off from the point, and
to the end they should go the swifter, they were rowed with boats. These came
right toward the Caruells, and in the greatest of them all went forty
fighting men, and in the other of the middle sort in each of them fine and
thirty, and in the lesser sort thirty men. All these were bowmen and shot,
and besides that they did carry Ordinance, and stood all abroad, which did
show so terrible and monstrous a front, as was fearful to be seen, the rather
being so great a fleet, in comparison of our small power to defend them, we
having but two Caruells and two boats* But this was ye day wherein God did well
show, the great regard he had to preserve us, for that neither the sight of so
many men, and so many sorts of ways whereby they had compassed and beset us,
neither yet such a Fleet, that was so great and mighty, with the fearful
cries that the Enemies did make, nor the terrible thundering of the Ordinance,
could any ways discourage or make us afeard. The greater of the Castles being
come hard to this defense, did then shoot off all his ordinance at the
Caruels, and the Captain general commanded to shoot at the same with a
Saker, the which caused the said Castle to stand wavering, but yet did them
little harm, neither yet with another piece that they shot off forthwith,
with the which Captain general was so sad, The prayer of a distressed mind
in the bitterness of heart.
that he lifted up his eyes unto heaven, saying: Lord, do not return my
sins to my face at this time, and this he said with such a loud voice, that
some there were that heard the same. In the mean while came the other Paraos,
which did set themselves right equal with the first, and with the coming of
these, the battle did increase more and more very stoutly on all parts. Their
arrows came so thick, which made so great a shadow, that sometimes there
appeared neither heaven nor earth, with y^ great smoke of their Ordinance. The
Captain general did turn, and command to shoot at the great Castle the
Saker again, and as with y^ other shot past, they had somewhat shaken their
iron works which were not very strong, so with the same shot they presently
brake, and after yt the iron works were thus broken, some of their beams being
likewise carried away, with certain of their men slain, with y^ same our men
gave a great cry, and the Captain general falling down on his knees, gave God
great thanks, and returning to shoot the Saker again, did carry away another
row of beams, with many more slain and hurt, and the Ordinance being shot
off again, it was all torn in pieces in a small space, and so the enemies
went with their Castle further of, but the others remained there fighting very
stoutly. And after this, both parts endured more trouble all the day following,
then in all the battles that were past: but in the end, we did so much hurt
unto their Castles, and sunk and rent so many of their Paraos in pieces, y^
the enemies could not abide the same, and therefore they shrank thence. The
fight did endure till euensong time, and began in y^ morning: of the enemies
were many slain, as afterward was seen in y^ water, and of us none, nor any
hurt, but only bruised with a shot which went through ye Admiral, ye bullet went
among many that were there, but they received no harm.

The Captain general seeing the enemies went their way, followed them in
their Boats, and such Paraos as he had, shooting always at those that were
upon the point Ar^aul, with the king, and with the force of their Ordinance
made them run away, leaving behind them slain three hundred and thirty
men. This being done, he then returned to his Caruells, where that evening
came to visit him the Prince of Coching in the behalf of the king, who sent to
excuse himself that he could not come to visit him in his own person. But he
sent him again word, that he would receive no discharge, until such time he
knew his heuines was past, but prayed him from hence forth to believe better in
God, for that the dangerous day of the Castles was past, and he remained in
the passage as he did before, all safe, and in readiness to serve him. The
self same day came to visit him certain noble men, of those that were of the
king of Cochings side, with whom there was made great triumph for this
victory: and likewise there went to see him many Moors Merchants which
brought him great presents, supposing to get of him thereby great friendship.
He received them very gently, praieng them to be true subjects to the king of
Coching, for thereby they should find him assured at any time whenever he
might stand them in any steed, whereupon they faithfully promised so to do,
and to bind them the more, he made them very great cheer. Also the next day
in the morning the king of Coching came to visit him, who embraced him with as
great gladness as could be devised, saying that he did well perform ye which
he had promised, in giving the king of Calycut the overthrow. But unto this he
answered, that he had not performed all his promise, since that he did not put
him on the Caluete, but he was not in fault thereof, for that the king kept
himself always far from him. He declared also to the king diverse other
matters of pleasure, which the king answered in like manner, praising very much
his valiantnes, and that he had well seen ye God did fight for us, asking of
him forgiveness for ye distrust he had in him, and how greatly he was bound to
succor him, declaring also that the affairs of Portingale were very great,
and confessing likewise that he through his worthiness had made him king.
After this victory the inhabitants of Coching did cast off the fear they had
of the king of Calycut, in such sort, that never from thence forth they stood
in any dread of him, neither yet made account of his habilitye.

Of the counsel which the king of Calycut took of his brother, and how he
was gaine-saide: and also by what policy and means the king of Calycut
sought to kill the Captain general. chap. 72.
THE king remained greatly ashamed and very sad, for that at the same time he
could not overthrow the Captain General, the rather because he never
accounted any thing more certain, then to over come him in that conflict,
because of the Castles which he had prepared for his confusion. And now leaving
a side all hope ever to have the victory, he desired to have with us no more
wars, and therefore he called before him into his tents, all those kings and
noble men that came to help him, and said thus unto them.

YOU do well see how little our power profits us against these men, The king
of Calicuts oration unto his noble men.
and how little our policies prevails since they do not regard us, and
would never give over the passage, notwithstanding the great power we had
against them. The like account also they make of us in their feasts, and
pastimes when we go against them, as though we were the fewer, and they the
more, and as though the land which they are in were theirs, and we were the
Christians, whereby it appears, they always make account of the victory for
certain, which either they obtain by witchcrafts, or else their God does
fight for them, which cannot be otherwise, considering the great victories
they have had against us, and the great hurt that we have received of them.
Wherefore I suppose that God would it should be so, for the little justice yt is
observed in these wars, as has well appeared in the beginning of the same. And
if I had been well advised, it should not have gone so far forward, but in the
end I am in the fault, and not they, and since it is so, we have therein no
right cause, neither can get any thing by our strength. Let us therefore
give it over, and desire no more to have Coching, for that God does favor
these men, since well you see, there is no power in the Indias that can offend
us so long, we being so strong, but these dogs, of whom I am afraid, yt they
will subdue the Indias, according to the acts that they have done, and the
credit that they have gotten, especially in Malabar. And that this mishap may
go no further, I think it should be convenient to procure their friendship,
and also it is time to get us away, for y^ the winter comes on, and the
rivers do increase, and these men do ouerrun all: and this is certain, ye if
the wars endure, they will come hither and enforce us to depart with our loss
and dishonor. Now y^ first that he asked council of what was necessary to be
done, was his brother Nabeadarin, who being angry with the king that he would
never follow his council, and leave the wars, said: that now he knew to his
cost what he had told him of us: and since in time he would not know it, he
asked him what it should now profit him for his honor and credit, since y^ then
when opportunity served he refused his council, but now he willed him to do
what he should think good, for he could not do amiss. The king being somewhat
broken of his pride, (calling him brother) said that now there was no time to
answer him after such sort, but to tell him his opinion what he thought best.
The prince answered y^ we were venterous, The counsel that the king of
Calicuts brother gave him touching the making of peace with the captain
general.
and always remained so assured of the victory, upon our experienced strength
and good fortune, albeit our power were much less, so ye he greatly doubted we
would none of his friendship. And for thee to offer ye same, said he to ye
king, and they to refuse it, would be no less dishonor unto thee, then the
often ouerthrows y^ thou have received. And since by thy proffered friendship,
we cannot get so much as we should loose if they refuse y^ same, it were best
therefore not to procure it, but to defer it, and make peace with the Captain
general that comes y^ next year from Portingale, who considering how little
the wars will profit him, and not being assured of good success therein, will
be the gladder to make peace with thee, and therefore that it may not be thought
that we run away for fear, let us stay and not depart, until such time it
should be thought, that ye necessity of the winter did enforce us hence, and
then may we well talk of peace, when possible the Captain general will
willingly accept the same, doubting that his good fortune may change. And to
provoke and give occasion the rather to have his friendship, let us give him no
more battles in the mean time, since it serves to no purpose, but to the
great loss and confusion of our men.

This council of Nabeadarin was reproved by the kings and noble men which were
there then assembled, and especially of the Lord of Repelyn, which said that
the king ought not to go away, neither for the greatness of the winter that
should come, nor yet for the iosse of his men, but rather to continue, giving
us many battles, until such time he did take us, and not only procured the
destruction of us in Coching, but also of those that were in Cananor and
Coulan. And that immediately it were expedient they sent men of credit with
letters to affirm, that they had boorded our Caruells with their Castles, A
subtle device by means of a lie to have brought our me^ to destruction but it
took no effect*
and had also slain us all, and taken our said Caruells, and therefore that
they should kill all those that were there, as they had promised. To the same
effect therefore the king did write immediately and the Moors also, but there
was no credit given to the same, for that there was other news sent before,
and therefore the last was taken for false. Nevertheless for all that, by the
industry of the Moors the which did dwell in those two towns, our men were in
great danger, and durst not come out of their Factoryes, and in Coulan there
was one slain, but in the other places none, for afterward messengers were
sent from Calycut to the Gentiles, that our men were alive, and what we had
done. For which cause the king of Calycut was answered that they would not
kill our men, until such time the Captain General was taken, and that he had
first given him the overthrow, which being done, they would conclude with
him. This being come to the knowledge of the Lord of Repelyn, both he and the
Moors did persuade the king to fight another battle with the Captain
General, the which he would willingly not have done, for that he was wearyed
in his spirit, but he could not withstand them, and therefore commanded the
same to be given both by Sea and land. But in it he had like success as
before, so that more through the importunate desire of the Moors then of his
own will, he gave in his own person another battle with his Castles, with
many more men and vessels then in the other before. This battle endured
longer then the other, in which also the enimyes were overcome, and received
far greater loss then ever they did before. With this victory that we had
gotten, the inhabitaunts of Coching remained sure from all their enemies, and
so likewise did the king, whom afterward came to visit the Captain general,
being brought in a chair, with far greater estate then ever he came before,
since the first beginning of all the wars. This being known in the camp of
the enemies, the kings and noble men that were with the king of Calicut, took
occasion to say unto him that he should not consent, in especially having such
a great power as he had there present, An aunsvvere which ye king of
Calicut made unto certain noble me^*
that the king of Coching should have him in so small reputation, as thereby to
judge himself free from him, and out of his danger. To the which the king of
Calicut made answer, ye the king of Coching had great reason to do that which
he had done, in especially knowing his great power and camp, and yet
perceiving that he could not give him the overthrow. And since that his evil
fortune was such, he desired them not to wish him to go forward in these wars,
for that he knew well and was fully persuaded, that continuing the same, he
should always receive the loss, and run daily into greater danger, as by the
fear thereof it was apparaunt. And therefore he requested them all to let him
alone by himself, who so being, did imagine again what course he might best
take to revenge himself.

And after that he came aboard, he called for certain of his Nayres, in whom
he had reposed all his trust, commanding them to go to Coching with some
dissimulation, and there to travail all that they could to kill the Captain
general, and all such of our men as they could meet withal. And as the Naires
are men inconstant, and cannot keep counsel longer then they are bethinking
themselves thereof, therefore immediately their intent was known to the Captain
general, who from thence forward had a better regard to himself, and unto the
rest of his company then he had before. And the better to take those Naires
which came as Spies thither, he appointed thereunto two companies of y^ Naires
of Coching, commanding the one to k*pe dilligentlye a long the foord, and the
other a long the river, who watched by quarters both by day and night. Whilst
this diligence was used, the Captain General had knowledge that this spy was
a Naire of Coching, and of the house or stock of the Leeros, who had attendant
upon him certain Nayres that were strangers, which appeared to be like
those of Calicut.

Now having certain knowledge hereof, he so hand the matter, and in such
order, that forthwith he took them all prisoners, and being brought before
him, he commanded them to be cruellye whipped in the presence of those Naires
of Coching, and afterward to be hanged. The inhabitauntes of Coching seeing
this, requested the Captain General to give them some other punishment since
that they were Nayres, and not to show them so great extremity, but
notwithstanding he would not grant unto any other punishment, for that they
had deserved the same.

Then all his Captains said unto him, The Oration of certain captains unto
their general for his better advise in administration of justice.
that first and before all he should call to remembrance, the great troubles
that the King of Coching had sustained for the only mainteining of them,
and also how much it would grieve him to hear say, that such were hanged in
his Country without his consent.

Also it would give an occasion for such noble men as were with him, to say
that he is a king but for a while, since that his jurisdiction is now taken
from him. And forasmuch as hitherto he had used him always with reverence,
they wished that now at the end he would have him in a greater estimation
then ever he had before.

The Captain General having considered their reasons, did allow of their
good council herein, and caused those Naires to be sent for, that were gone
to execution, of the which there were two half dead, but those that were
living he sent to the king of Coching, aduertising him how that they had
deserved death, and also the cause why he had not commanded them to be
hanged.

The King hearing this, took the same in great honor and estimation, that
they were sent him, and especial for that there were present sundry of the
noble men of his Country, and of other places, yea, and Moors also, of the
chiefest that dwelt in Coching, which did not let to say unto the king to
afrunt him withal, that our men were they that commanded and did not obey.

But from hence forth the Captain General had such intelligence, that the
subtle dealinges of the king of Calycut, took very small effect against him.

How the king of Calicut of pure heaviness for the ill success he had in the
wars, did put himself into a Torcull, and within a small time after came
forth thereof. chap. 73.
June being now ended, and the winter beginning to increase, the Captain
general thought that it would be some cause that the king of Calicut would
not tarry there long. And therefore he was fully minded to set upon him at the
removing of his camp, for that by experience he knew the small valor of his
enemies, by such victories as he had gotten in times past, which did therefore
animate him the more thereunto, thinking that at such a time he might do him
much harm. And being in a readiness to vncheine his Mastes, he was presently
informed that the king of Calicut was reforming a new his Castles, and
preparing in a readiness a greater Fleet then ever he had before, that he
might give him therewith once more the battle. A false alarome given forth by
ye Calicutians to terrify the Portingals with all.
This was but a fleeing news that was commanded to be given out by the king
of Calycut, who did surmise that at the raising of his Camp, which he was
minded to do, and to go his way, the Captain General would set upon
him.

And therefore he determined, that his departure should be so secretlye done,
that no man should know thereof but only Nabeadarin. For this cause
therefore he gave out, that he would give the battle in the passage of
Palurte, and also in the Foorde both together, to the end the Captain
General might occupy himself in defending them both, and he himself the
better steal away, as he did: but he got nothing thereby, more then he
had gotten before.

After all this, on Saturday in the Evening, which was Saint John's even, on
which day they gave out, that they would give the battle, there appeared the
whole army of the enimyes as they were accustomed to show themselves. The
Captain General hoping of their coming, did tarrye there all that night, but
in the morning he saw no likelihood thereof, and meruailing what that should
mean, was informed by two Bramenes that the king of Calycut was gone with his
whole power unto Repelyn, and that at that present he was there.

For this news he was very sorry, but yet for all that he entered that
present day into Repelyn, where he fought with many of his enimyes, slew and
hurt a great number, and so returned to the passage, where he remained yet
certain days to ensure Coching the better, which was yet afeard of the King
of Calycuts returning, fearing that he would not leave this passage. Howbeit
the Captain General was well assured that he would not come there, by reason
he was fallen into such reproach and shame, in the sight of all men, because of
his great losses. So that immediately after that he had past the rivers of
Repelyn, he apparted himself with his noble men which had accompanied him in
these wars, and said unto them with weeping eyes in this manner following.

FOR a man that is without shame, the kings Oration, made to such princes and
noble me^ as came to aid him in these vvarres.
as I am, it is not much to shed these tears as I do, the heaviness of my
loss being such, as fetches the same from my heart, with the which I am so
troubled, that since it is so, that I cannot do it in public forte, I will
go into some place where I may do the same without any body that may see me.
I have also another grief which troubles me very sore, over and besides my
dishonor, which is, for that I am not able to reward you for all the great
good will and service you have done me in these wars, the which I take for
so great a duetye, that if so be that I might see my self discharged of the
same, I should be better contented, then with the getting of Coching. But
since it is not Gods pleasure that I should get the victory over it, which
has procured my dishonor, so is it not his pleasure and will that I possess
the state of a king any longer, but rather for the amending of my sins will
end my life in this Torcull, A Torcull is as much as with us an hermitage, or
such like pore kind of solitary relgious place*
where I mean to continue until such time that God has taken away this
hatred, which he has conceived against me. And from this time forward you
may dispose of your selves, and do what you shall think best with my country
and subjects. I do not offer you my person, for so much as being a man so
unfortunate as I am, it shall not stand with your credit to require his
company, and with this speech he ended his talk.

But the Princes and Noble men would somewhat have comforted him, and
withdrawn him from this his determination, but it could not prevail, for that
he had fully bent himself to the contrary, and so with certain of his
Chaplains he entered into this Torcull.

Now his mother having knowledge that he was there, she sent him word, that
for this his sodeine determination she remained as heavy and with as
sorrowful a heart as might be. The Mothers message to ye King of Calycut,
being in the Torcull.
Informing him moreover, that through this sodeine chance, there has risen in
Calycut a great alteration, for that from thence are gone and now are ready to
go many and sundry merchants, and also that the city is become wonderfully
unprovided of victuals, with the great fear the inhabitants are in of the
Christians: which is the occasion there are no victuals brought thither. But no
persuasion she said, Where credit is impaired, it is better to lurk then to
run abroad with dishonor.
could withdraw him from these wars with the Christians, which from the
beginning of the same was a great grief unto her: willing him also that in no
case he should return unto Calycut, until he might do the same with his
credit, which was clean lost already. And therefore she counseled him a
while to forbear, until such time he did recover it again, and that with
victory, yea, and rather to loose all then to return without it. With this
message the Kings heaviness increased greatly, and he sent immediatelye for
his Brother, to whom being come, he gave him charge of the government of his
kingdom. But after that he came out of the foresaid Torcull, it was restored
unto him again.

How there came sundry Kings and Princes of the Country to demand peace of
the Captain general: and also how there came unto Coching many Moors of
Calycut, to inhabit there. Chap. 74.
ALL these Kings and Noble men, which came to serve ye king of Calicut (after
that he had placed himself in the Torcul) remained a few days in Repelyn,
tarrieng to see whether he did repent himself of that which he had done, or
not: and perceiving ye contrary, each of them repaired toward their Countries,
whereof the most part of them lay there along the water side. And for so much as
the Winter began to increase, and they fearing least the Captain general
would overcome them all, having now lost the hope they had to defend themselves
now as before time. Therefore they minded to procure as much as they could, the
goodness of the King of Cochings nature noted in being a mean to procure*
to be friends and in peace with the Captain general. For the which intent as
Mediator for the same purpose, they sent to the King of Coching, whom for that
his condition and nature was very good; and without calling to remembrance the
injuries that were past, which they had done unto him, did undertake to do the
same. Sending them immediately a safeconduct for their safe coming unto
Coching, from whence he went in their company to visit the Captain general,
whom at their meeting, he earnestly requested to receive them as his friends,
peace for his enemies.
who answered, that for his sake he would so do. Diverse other Princes also
there were, that could not come, but yet notwithstanding they sent unto him
their Ambassadors to conclude this peace likewise. Also sundry Moors of
Calycut that were great Merchants, to the end they might quietly use their
trade, forsook Calycut, and came to dwell at Coching, with the consent of the
Captain general. Others there were that went to Cananor and Coulan, so that
the great Trade that was before in Calycut began suddenly to fall. And for that
the Moors of Calycut began in this sort to inhabit in Coching, therefore the
Captain general would not leave this passage, as also for that there came
many and sundry times Paraos from Calycut into the rivers to keep the same, by
Nabeadarins commandment. Howbeit the Captain general met with them and
fought with them, and hurt many of his enemies. Moreover, he oftentimes entered
into the Lord of Repelyns Country to take Cattle for his provision, and
fought with many of his enemies, upon whom he made great slaughter. One day by
chance our men met with certain Tones of the enemies, the which were in a
certain standing water, and carried them away into the rivers, and made with
the enemies a valyant and stout skirmish, in the which was slain the greatest
part of them, and not one of our men hurt.

After all this, The Lord of Repelin, is also reconciled unto the captain
general.
the Lord of Repelyn became the Captain generals friend, and came to visit
him, and brought him for a Present a great quantity of Pepper, which he had in
his Country.

How Lope Suares de Menesis departed for the Indias for captain general of
the Fleet that went in the year of our Lord, a 1504. and what more past or
ever he came to Ansadina. cap. 75.
IN the year of our Lord. 1504. the king of Portingale having certain
knowledge, 1504.
that the king of Calycut continued as yet in the wars, The fifte voyage to
the Indias made by ye Portingales*
did therefore send to succor our men with a Fleet of twelve great ships,
and appointed for General of the same, a Gentleman called Lope Suares de
Menesis, who in the time of king Don John the second, had been Captain in the
Mina. The Captains of the Fleet were these following.

Pedro de Mendosa, Lionel Cotinuo, Tristim de la Silua, Lope Mendus, de Vascon
Cele, Lope de Abreo, Philipe de Castro, Alonso Lopes de Castro, Alonso Lopes de
la Cocts, Pero Alonso, de Aguylar, Vasco de la Siluero, Vasco Caruallo, Pedro
Dynes de Sutunell. All these were Gentlemen borne, and some were made Gentlemen
by service. These also carried with them many valiant soldiers, who being
embarked, and the Captain General dispatched, did depart from Lishborne
the.xxii. of April in the self same year, and continuing their voyage on the
second day of May, they found themselves right in their course to Cape Verde.
The Captain generals oration with he made to his captains, masters and
Pilots.
Then y^ Captain general having here all y^ Fleet together, caused his
Captains, Masters, and Pilots, to assemble themselves, unto whom he spoke in
sense following. Willing them to call to remembrance how lately they had
departed from Portingale, for which cause it was requisite that they were
circumspect and diligent, and not to fall into such disorders and extremities
as hitherto they have done, for not looking every man unto his charge, and not
to suffer one ship leye the other a boorde, as they have done already, whereby
they ran all into great danger. Also there were others he said, that had no
regard to keep their right course, but unadvisedly there were some that would
go before, and others come after, and others by the wind, by means of which
disorder they might have cast away themselves. And the better to avoid these
dangers, and to keep the Fleet in good order, he did set down certain rules
in writing by his Scriuenor, and firmed thereunto his name, with the names of
the other Captains, which they should observe and keep.

Inprimis, Orders that were given to every captain, Master and Pilot, to keep
the same in their voyage.
That all the Fleet, as soon as it is night, shall follow his course,
remaining always a stern the General: and that no ship shall carry other
light, then only that which is in the Bytoke, and within the Captains cabin.
Also, that the Masters and Pilots keep their watch, and that they have a good
regard, that one ship do not lay the other a board, and that they do all
answer, when the Admiral does make any sign.

Item, That as soon as it is day, they do come and salute their General, and
that in the night they do not go before him. The penalty laid upon the breach
of these commandments.
He that does not observe these commandments, shall pay ten Crowns, and be
kept in prison, until they arrive there, and that without wages. And for that
there was some Masters and Pilots very neglygent, by whose default one ship did
lay the other a board, he commanded to remove them from one ship to another:
and by this diligence that was thus used, every man had a regard thereunto, and
the Fleet went in good order, and never after ran in any danger. Thus going
on their course in the month of June, and judging themselves over against the
Cape Buena spuransa, there fell upon them a marvelous great storm of wind,
with the which all the Fleet ran two days and two nights without sails, so
yt they were in great danger to have been all cast away, the wether being so
dark and close, that it seemed rather night, then day.

These two days being past, they saw certain signs of land, the which as
it did appear, could not be far off, and for that cause was the weather so
close. After that they had discryed ye same, and were come near thereunto, then
these signs appeared the greater. And therefore the Captain general
commanded, that out of his ship there should be shot two pieces of
Ordinance, that the others might after the same manner answer with the like,
and the better keep company the one with the other. This storm being past,
they found missing the ship of Lope Mendez. And the Captain general seeing
that he had lost the sight thereof did not let to go forward on his course.

And so, within certain days through the negligence of the Officers, one
ship laid the other a boorde, and gave therewith so great a blow upon the
how of ye other, that with the same there was opened so great a hole, A great
leake given unto one of ye ships through negligence of the sailers*
that they might see through the ship very well, by the which hole there
entered such abundance of water upon a sudden, that she was almost sunk.
The Captain general bare with the same ship immediately, and came so near
them that they might well hear him, and the great comfort he gave them,
willing them not to be a fearde, but to go forward in stopping the leake,
without fear to be lost, for that he was there to succor them with his men,
which he did send in his Boats not fearing the Seas, that went so high, nor
the danger that they were in.

And for all that the Mariners of the ship did so work, that or ever it was
night the leake was half stopped: yet that they might end y^ rest that
remained to do, the Captain general commanded to be made a sign by the same
ship, that the other Captains might come and succor him, if there were any
such need. The wether being ye next day somewhat calm, The leak stopped, and
the danger thereof past, they sail forvvard*
the leake was wholly ended, the which was stopped with certain hides nailed
thereunto, and pitched upon.

This danger being past, without any other mischaunce, worth the writing,
they arrived at Monsanbique on Saint James day, where the Governor received
him very well, and sent him great refreshing of fresh victuals, and the
Letter that Pedro de Tayde had left there for him before he dyed, as I have
said before.

Who understanding by the same, of the wars that the King of Calycut had
begun against our men, did as soon as the ship was rigged, and made in a
readiness, which they had brought a ground for the same purpose, he departed
toward Mylynde, being the first of August. And immediatelye after his
arrival there, the King sent to visit him by one of his principal Moors,
Certain Portingales sent unto the Captain general for a present.
by whom he sent for a Present sixteen of our men, the which did escape out
of the ship that Pedro de Tayde was Captain of.

Within two days after this, he departed toward the Indias, and so came to
Ansadina, where he found two Gentlemen, the one called Antonyo de Saldanua,
and the other Ruy Lorenso, which were Captains of two ships, and were in
groat fear, supposing that our Fleet had been of the Rumes. Then Antonyo de
Saldanua, informed largelye the Captain general how he departed the last
year from Portingale for Vice admiral, with Ruy Lorenso, being given him in
commission to go and discover the red Sea with the Countries adjacent. And how
that in doubling the Cape, they were very sorelye troubled with a storm,
which was the only cause of the separating the one of them from the company
of the other. But Ruy Lorenso as he kept his course after their separation, met
by chance in the way to Sofala, with a certain ship of the Moors being laden
with much gold, the which he took: and afterward that he had taken the
spoil of the same, he left the Hull in keeping at Mylynde. Antonyo de
Saldanua went to Quardafum, where he took many great and exceeding rich
prices, without entering at all into the Straights: and from thence he went
into the Indias.

And for that he came not to Ansadina before it was the Winter, he was
therefore driven to tarry there with Ruy Lorenso, who having passed many
dangers, came afterward thither, where he past great troubles, for lack of
victuals.

How the Captain general came to Cananor, and spoke with the King: and how
the Governor of Calycut, would have made peace with him, howbeit he would
not consent thereunto. Chap. 76.
THe Captain general being here, came thither unto him Lope Mendez de
Vascon celis, who had lost the company of his General, with the foul wether
past. And immediately after that he was come, the Captain general made him
pressed, for his departure toward Cananor, where he arrived the first day of
September. There the Factor informed him of the wars of Calycut, and how that
he with his other fellows that remained in Cananor, had seen themselves
oftentimes in danger of death.

The next day after his coming thither, The Captain general goes a land to
visit the king of Cananor.
he would needs go a land to visit the King of Cananor. All the Captains
of the Fleet he carried in his company to attend upon him with their Boats,
the which were set forth with their Flagges and Ordinance to the uttermost,
and the men apparayled in the best apparayle that they had. And as for the
Boat in the which the Captain general went, it was covered over and beset
with Carpettes in the best manner, The state which the Captain general kept
at his going to visit ye king of Cananor.
upon the which stood his Chair, the which was made of unshorn Crimson
Velvet, and at his feet there were set two very fair Cushions of the same.
His Dublet was also made of Satin, being of sundry colors, the which was
wrought Diamond wise.

And moreover, his hose were made after the same sort, and his Shoes were
likewise made of black Velvet, which were all beset with Aglets of gold, and
his Cap covered over with Buttons suitable to the same: his night gown was made
of black Velvet, after the French use laced about, with lase of gold, his
Dagger and Rapyer which his page held, were hafted with pure gold, and his
cheine came three times about his neck, the links whereof were all enameled,
and at the same he had hanging his Whistle of gold of the like work. There
went before him his two Lackyes, appareled as himself, and six trumpetters
with their Flagges of silk. He had also with him certain wind instruments,
upon the which they went plaieng, which were carried in a little Boat hard by
him, and in the same was carried also a present for the king of Cananor, which
the king of Portingale sent unto him. The present which ye king of Portingal
sent to the king of Cananor.
This present was six beds of fine holand, with two great pillowes and
pillowbeers to the same, all wrought with gold. Two Couertors or Carpets of
Crimsin Velvet unshorn, which on the uttermost side were all quilted over, and
had upon the same three gards of cloth of gold, which in the midst was a
spanne in breadth, and in the other places of three fingers. The bedsteede was
all guilted over, the which had Curteines of Crimosin Satin, with Fringe made
of gold thread. As soon as the Captain General did put of from his ships,
all the Fleet began to shoot off. Afterward the Trumpettes did sound, and
the Drums play. After this was ended, then the Organs went, and never ceased,
till they came to the water side, where there were great multitudes of Moors
and Gentiles, which came thither only to see the Captain General. Who as
soon as he had disimbarked himself, The king of Cananors bravery and state at
his meting with the captain general*
entered into a certain house, the which the king had caused to be made for
the same purpose hard by the water side, in the which the bedstead with the
whole furniture apperteining was set up, and hard by the same there was a place
appointed for y^ captain general to sit down on. When the king of Cananor
came, he brought before him three Elephants armed, as though they should
fight, and after them there came a squadron of three thousand Naires, with
their weapons, which was swoordes, targets, and spears. Also there came
another squadron of two thousand bow men. Last of all came the king himself
sitting in a chair, the which was very rich. When he was come to this Sarame,
the ordinance of all the Fleet was shot off. The Captain General thereby
perceiving the king to be at hand, went forth as far as the door to
receive him. And after that they had embraced each other, he presented him with
the bed, unto the which the king did go immediately, and lay down upon the
same. The Captain General seeing that, sat down in his place appointed, and
there they conferred together for the space of two hours. In the mean while a
graye hounde of the Captain Generals would have set upon one of the
Elephants, and because he was holden, he therefore barked and plunged in such
sort, that there was none that could hear, by reason of the noise they made,
neither yet there was any able to hold him, which was the occasion the king
and the Captain general were so little time together. After this meeting,
there came unto the Captain General a Moore from Calycut, with whom there was
also in company a Portingale boy, which brought a letter from such of our men
as remained then captives, from the time of Pedro Aluares Cabrals being there,
who told him by word of mouth, that the king of Calycut was so broken in mind
with the wars that he had with Edwarte Pacheco, that with pure heaviness
he put himself into a Torcull, sequestring himself from all the world.

And that there were many Moors Merchaunts so earnestly bent to follow their
trade, The Mores for sake Calicut, and go else where to dvvell*
that they have left Calicut, and are gone to dwell in other places, by reason
whereof, there is in Calycut great necessity of victuals. And therefore that
the King of Calycut, the Prince, the Aldermen, and all the dwellers of Calicut
are desirous to make peace, and are determined to send unto him about the same.
And gave our men lycense to write thereof to the Captain General, the which
they so did, not only about their request, but also to desire him to release
them out of captivity.

The Captain General seeing and perusing this Letter, would have answered
the same, but the Boy would not consent thereunto, saying that of force he must
needs return with the Moore, for that they gave him no further lycense, but
to bring this Letter, upon condition that if he did not return, they would
cut off the heads of all those his fellows that remained for Captives in
Calycut. Wherefore the Captain General sent them answer by word of mouth,
that as touching his going to Coching, it would be shortly, where he would
come to an Ankor as near as he could to Calycut, passing by the same: and
then they might take an occasion to come their way toward the Fleet, either
swimming or in Boats.

This their going without yrons about the City, He would have the^ to escape
from their keepers, and come svvimming unto him*
was the occasion that the Captain General gave them this council, although
he knew that they were kept with a guard of Naires, and also that they slept
in the kings house. After all this, he departed toward Calycut, whether he
came on Saterdaye, the seventh of September, and as soon as he came to an
Ankor, there repaired unto him the Boy, which brought him ye letter to
Cananor, and with him came a Moore Servant to Cosebyquin, who brought the
Captain General a present from ye Governors of the city of Calicut, on
whose behalf they said, that if so be he would send unto Cosebyquin a safe
conducte, that then he would come and speak with him, and trade for a peace.

Whereunto he answered, that he would not accept their present, nor any
other thing, until such time the peace was concluded upon: and as for
Cosebyquin, he might come unto him without any fear, as a servant of the
king of Portingales. Also priuelye he sent our men word that they should
endeavor as much as they could to run away. This answer being known to the
governors, they sent immediately Cosebyquin with two captive Portingales to the
Captain General, believing most certeinlye, that by this means they should
provoke us to make the peace, which they sent to demand by the foresaid
Cosebyquin. Praieng him also to tarry three or four days, Two two Italian
ru^agates justly required by the Captain general to be delivered.
which they supposed would be the longest time that the king would tarry, for
that they had sent to call him, and knowing very well, that he would do all
that they would require him. But he gave them for full answer, that until such
time they delivered unto him the two Italian runagates that were in Calicut, he
would not agree to any thing, which being delivered, he would then do what he
thought good, but he sent them word nothing of y^ captives, for that he thought
that at any time they might run their way. But as soon as the Italians had
knowledge, A craftye devise of the Italians to have the captives closelye kept
for the assurance of themselves.
that the Captain general did demand them, they then surmised that if so be,
the captives went not with yrons, they would run away, and so gave notice
thereof unto the governors of the City, how that the Captain General, if yt
he might have them would make peace, yea, and with such conditions as the king
himself would require, for that they were men of a good estimation, so that
the Captain General would not forgo them for any price.

The Aldermen giving credit unto this, waxed somewhat cold in speaking any
further of peace, but kept the Captives from thence forth, in such sort that
they could not run away. And so they remained until the coming of the
Vizeroye Don Francisco de Almeda, and in the mean time some there were that
did run away, and others that died of great infirmities.

Of the great destruction which the Captain general made in Calycut, and how
he came unto Coching. chap. 77.
THE Captain General perceiving that the governors did conclude nothing, and
themselves were without hope to have the captives, he bent himself
determinatly to revenge himself with shooting off his ordinance both night
and day at the City, during the which time, he spoiled the same wonderfully,
and overthrew the kings house and part of their Pagodes, with many other of
their houses. He slew also sundry men that came to the water side, whereunto he
lay somewhat near with seven of his small ships. Moreover he had lieng a long
the shore all their boats, in the which were both men and ordinance. This being
done, he departed toward Coching, where he arrived on Saturday being the xiii.
day of September. All this day he kept himself a board, and thither came our
men to visit him. On the next day, he disimbarked himself hard by the castle
in like order as he did at Cananor, where the king of Coching was tarrieng for
him, and there received him with great pleasure. And after that he had embraced
him, they went hand in hand to the hall, in the which there was a seat of
estate, Ambassadors are to keep their estates for the honor of their Princes
that send them.
whereupon was set a chair. And for that the king did sit low according to his
order, ye Captain general commanded to place the chair somewhat further off
from the kings seat, in the which he sat down also. But all those that were
present were greatly offended with him, for that he did not sit upon his chair
of estate by the king, to whom he delivered a Letter from the king of
Portingale, in the which were rendered unto him great thanks, for the favor
he had showed unto his subjects, with many other gratulations. Unto the which
the king answered, that for all such matters he was fully satisfied with the
good service that Edwarte Pacheco had done unto him.

The next day after, the Captain General sent him a great sum of money, the
which the king of Portingale did bestow upon him, for that he knew he was but
poor.

After all this, he commanded Pedro de Mendosa, and Vasco Caruallo to go with
their ships to keep the coast of Calycut, that they might take all such ships
of ye Moors as were laden with Spices: and also he sent Alonso Lopes de la
Cocta, and Peralonso de Aguylar, and Lyonel Cotinuo, and Ruy de Abren, to go
and receive in their lading at Coulan, for that he knew there was spice in
abundaunce.

Moreover he commanded Tristim de la Silua, to go to Grangalor, between the
rivers, with four boats armed, They met with spices better cheap, and nerer
hand then at Gra^galor.
of purpose to fight there with certain Paraos of Calycut, the which were
there armed. So Tristim de la Silua shot at some of them, and also at certain
Nayres, the which issued out from certain points of the land, and so without
coming to Grangalor, he took a ship laden with Pepper, with the which he
returned to Coching, where he did lade with the other Captains, which was
done very quietly: and there was such great store of spices, that there was
none then needed.

How Edwarte Pacheco departed from Coulan unto Coching: and how the Captain
General did set upon Grangalor, and what he did there. Chap. 78.
EDwarte Pacheco being come from the coast of Coulan, as soon as he had sight
of the Captains, the which the Captain general had sent, and for that he
should have no more to do after his arrival at Coching, since there was come
another Captain General, did depart toward Coching the xxii. of October, and
keeping his course, had sight of a ship a far off in the Sea, toward the
which he made all that day, and part of the night, and this ship was driven
into Coulan* where having talk with the same, he did understand that he was
one of the confederates the which came from Coromandil. And immediatlye after
were seen other three ships of Calycut, toward the which he made his
course, and kept a long the coast with the wind of the shore. In the morning
he went into the Sea, and there he saw a Sail* the which fled away from him
in such sort, yt til it was toward the evening he could not overtake the same,
but hard to the land, A ship of Calicut taken and carried away*
with the which he fought a good while, for that it had many men that did
defend themselves, but at the end he made them amain. The ship being
yielded, our men did enter the same by Edwarte Pachecos commandment, and
there were brought a land certain of their men, the rest he commanded to be
kept prisoners and in yrons, a board his ship.

And having knowledge that this was one of the three of Calicut, the which he
went to seek out, he put in the same two of our men to keep and carrye it
with him. When he was come right over against Comorin, there fell upon him on
a sodeine such a hurling Wind, that thereby he was brought in great hazard to
be cast away.

This being past, came to an Ankor within a league of the shore, and there
remained all that night, in the which there ran away well near thirty
Moors, of the which were twelve taken again with his Boat. After this, he
went up and down, wavering in the wind, tarryeng for the rest of the ships,
and seeing that they came not, nor yet heard no more news of them, he carried
the foresaid ship with him to Coulan. After that he had delivered the ship
to the Factor, with all such merchandise as he had, the which were many and
rich, he departed toward Coching, where after his coming the ships of the
Fleet went to lading. And likewise the others being come that were a lading
in other places, then the Captain general did enter in council, whether that
they thought good that he should set upon Grangalor or not, forasmuch as it
held on the king of Calycuts side, and was enemy to the king of Coching. And
now also the king of Calicut was come forth of the Torcull to Calycut, The king
of Calicut is now come forth of ye Torcul and takes ye government upon him.
and had in the rivers his Captain general with four score Paraos, and
fifty ships, and by land had appointed Nabeadarin with a great number of
men.

And forasmuch as it was spread abroad, that the Captain General did depart
toward Portingale, the king of Calycut was minded to return and renew the
wars. Now the Captain general being determined and advised by all the
Captains to set upon Grangalor, he departed one night with xv. boats, the
which were armed with paueyses, and with five and twenty Paraos from Coching,
replenished with Ordinance. Also with these there went a Caruell, so that in
the whole there were welnigh a thousand of our men, with whom there went also
as many Nayres of Coching. In the morning before it was day, he came to
Palypuerto, for he durst venture no further, for that the Boats went very
heavy laden with their furniture, by reason whereof they could not pass the
shoells that were there.

At this place there came against him the Prince with eight hundred Nayres, and
after this sort, some there were of them that went by land, and some by water.
Thus they departed toward Grangalor, where the king of Calycuts Captain
general was, in two new ships, the which were cheined together full of
Ordinance and men, and the most of them bow men. And a stearne these ships,
and on both their sides were these Paraos with many men also.

The Captain General of the enemies had in his company two of his sons,
which were accounted for to be very valiant Gentlemen. Our Fleet being come,
the Ordinance began to go off on both parts. Tristim de la Silua, Alonso
de la cocta, Vasco caruallo, Peralonso de Aguylar, and Antonio de S^^dania,
which went in the Vangarde* did close with the two ships, with the which they
fought a while.

These ships being boorded, The Captain general of the enemies and his two
sons slain.
were immediately yielded, being first of all slain, the Captain general
and both his sons, the which fought very valyantlye, and also many others,
for that in this place was all the force of the Battle. And as touching the
Paraos that the other Captains did set upon, there was but little to do,
for so much that as soon as they saw their ships boorded they fled their way.
Whereupon commandment was given by the Captain general, that all our men
should disimbarke themselves, of whom the first five Captains were they that
gave the first onset upon Nambeadarin, who offered to resist, with certain
Nayres which he had in his retinue: with whom our men did fight with so
valyant a mind, that they made their enemies to run away. Then our men
following the chase did set fire to certain houses, beside all y^ Town which
was dispoiled both by the Moors and Gentiles, the which did well know, that
our men would come upon the^, as also did Nambeadarin and his men, which fled
away along the water side. Edwarte Pacheco, and the Factour Diego Hernando
Correa, with the other Captains did disimbarke themselves in another place,
who immediately began to set a fire the City. The Captain general in the
mean while remained along the water side to keep his men from scattering.
Then the Christians that dwelt in this City, and that were hidden amongst the
houses, when they saw the Town all in a fire, came out from where they were
hidden, crieng with a loud voice, and requesting them not to kill them for
that they were Christians. And some of them there were, y^ sent presently to the
Captain general, to pray him that for Gods sake he would command the fire
to be quenched, for that they should else burn certain Churches of our Lady
and of the Apostles which were in the City, as also their poor houses, y^
which were mingled with the houses of the Gentiles and Moors. The fire
commanded to be quenched for ye pore christians takes that dwelled there*
Then for their sakes, the General commanded the fire immediately to be
quenched, although that many of their houses were burnt, which for that they
were made of timber, did burn quickly. The fire being quenched, our men fell to
ransaking of the houses of the Moors, among whom there were many which before
time had dwelt in Calicut. Moreover, the two ships with their Paraos that
were in the water were likewise burnt, besides other three yt were a land. This
conflict yet continuing, there came thither the Prince of Coching, who told the
Captain General, that Nambeadaryn was not far off with his power, who was
determined to return to the City, after that he was departed. Then the
Captains procured license of the Captain General that he would suffer them
to go seek him out, and so they did. But as soon as the enemies had sight of
them, they ran their way as fast as they could. The Captain general seeing
this, did return, and would have set upon another Town the which was not far
off, but for that the Prince of Coching requested him to the contrary, After a
valiant exploit, the Captain General makes knights in recompense of their
virtue.
for that the one half of the same was his, and that it was impossible to
destroy the one half without the other: and also for that the King of Calycuts
subjects were ready to submit themselves unto him, praying him to defend them.
Then the Captain general entered into the City, and did there make certain
Knights, and afterward returned to the Forte, to the which the King of Coching
came to visit him.

How the King of Tanor sent for succor to the Captain general; which he sent
him. Cap. 79.
AFter two or three days past that the Captain general was in the Castle,
there came thither unto him an Ambassador from ye King of Tanor, who is next
neighbor to the King of Calicut, who spoke unto him in this order, on y^ king
his masters behalf, An ambassador sent to the captain general from the king
of Tanor, who made the Oration following.
That whereas, heerto he had been a friend to the King of Calicut, and did
always aid him in all such wars as he had made against Edwarte Pacheco, now
since he is come out of the Torcull, presuming on his great power, and having
increased or rather doubled his pride, does in recompense of his good service,
make wars upon him. And therefore having knowledge that the King of Calicut
was minded to set forward and to succor the City of Grangalor, and that his
Captain general was marching toward the same, he did assemble 4000. Nayres,
which he placed in certain straights, by the which ye king of Calicut should
pass, and at his coming did set upon his whole camp and overthrew the same,
with the death of 2000. of his men, which was the cause yt he came not to
succor the city of Grangalor, but with this loss returned to Calicut.
Wherefore having done this exployt, he remains in fear, least he will come
and set upon him. And therefore his request is, that the Captain general will
succor him, since most humbly he does demand ye same: which if he will do,
he will promise him to be true subject to ye king of Portingale. To this
Embassage ye General answered, yt he was well content to accept him for ye
kings subject, and to send Pedro Raphael with his Caruell, in ye which were an
100. men, the most whereof were Crossebowmen, and shot. It was a great chance,
yt the same day our men came to Tanor, thither came also ye king of Calicut by
land with his whole camp, and gave to ye king of Tanor battle, The king of
Calycuts whole power overthrown at Tanor, by ye king thereof, and the
Portingales*
in which through ye valor of our men he was overthrown, and many of his
slain. And for this succor yt the General sent thither, the king of Tanor
remained subject to y^ king of Portingale. With this overthrow ye king of
Calicut continued in great fear, and in less credit with ye Moors, then he
had with ye victories that Edwarte Pacheco had gotten against him, because
those wars were made with strangers, but this with ye king of Tanor, who is his
neighbor. Which thing was ye cause, yr all such Moors, as dwelt in Calicut and
Grangalor conceived now so great a misliking to trade toward Meca, yt they
determined to return to their countries: and for this cause, they laded xvii.
great ships in Pandarane, fortifieng them to defend themselves from our men ye
better, and to offend the^, if they should come. Also there were many Paraos and
Tones, likewise a lading as fast as they could plye it.

How the Captain general fought in Pandarane with seventeen great ships of
the Moors, and how he overcame them and burned them. Chap. 79.
THe Captain general perceiving that of force he must needs return, with
all such ships as were laden, by counsel of the Captains, and for security
of the King of Coching and of the Fort there, did therefore appoint and leave
in Coching a Captain general, with whom he left a ship and two Caruels, the
one of Pedro Raphael, and the other of Diego Pieres. This Captain was a
Gentleman called Manuel telez de Vasconcelos, whom the Captain general did
present to the King of Coching, who had a great deal more desire, that Edwarte
Pacheco should have remained, for his good service, and affection he bare him,
as I have said. Howbeit notwithstanding, the effect of the words, which the
King of Coching spoke to Edvvarte Pacheco at his departure.
he durst not demand his tarrieng at the Captain generals hands, for so much
as he was of a very ill condition. Edwarte Pacheco having knowledge of his
going for Portingale, purposed first ere that he departed, to speak with the
King of Coching, the which he so did. For whose departure the King remained
very sorrowful, requesting him to tarry if so be it were possible in the
Indias, and not to leave him, for that as yet he did not think himself sure
from the King of Calicut, and also he told him that he remembered that he had
promised him sundry times not to go away, The answer that Edvvarte Pacheco,
gave to y^ king of Coching*
until such time he had made him King of Calicut, and since as yet he had not
the possession of the same, he desired him not to leave him. Edwarte Pacheco
answered him, that he left him now in a good time, having his Country very
quiet, for so much as the King of Calycut has been and now is abated so greatly
of his pride, that he needed not to stand in no fear of him any more. For
sufficient proof whereof was, if none other thing, that now he saw the Moors
of Meca to go their way from Calycut as men desperate for the loss of their
trade. Also that his going for Portingale was not but to return, and then to
serve him for a longer time, and more at his pleasure. With this answer the
King was somewhat satisfied, and with the tears in his eyes desired him to
pardon him, for that he did not give him all that was his desire, The good
will of a thankful mind is much more vvorth the^ many gifts*
in recompense of the service he had done for him, in consideration that he was
so poor, as he did well know. Howbeit he entreated him, that of his Pepper
which he had, he would take what he would. But Edwarte Pacheco would have
nothing, saying, that he did trust in God, that when he returned to Coching,
he should find him very rich, and in his prosperity, and then he would
receive reward of him. And with this he departed, the King with all his
subjects remaining very heavy for his departure. Moreover, the King wrote
unto the king of Portingale of all Edwarte Pacheco successes in the wars, and
what he had done for him. After this the Captain gerall departed toward
Cananor, the xxvi. of September, carieng in his company those Captains which
should remain in the Indias. His good will and intent was, to come to an Ankor
in the harbor of Panane, and there to visit the King of Tanor. But by reason
of the ill weather they had, and their naughty Pilots they could not reach y^
same, but were driven to Calycut and Pandarane. And from thence he commanded
Pedro Raphael and Diego Pieres to go before the Fleet, and to look out,
whether they could see any ships of the Moors. Being arrived at Pandarane, and
bearing along the Coast with a small wind, there came upon them x. Paros of
the xvii. ships that were there a lading. Our men having sight of them, began
forthwith to shoot at them with their ordinance. The other Captayns being a
Sea board, and hearing the sound of the ordinance, did return, and bare as
close by the wind as they could. And having sight of the ships of the Moors
to be a ground, came to Cananor by the Captain generals commandment, who
immediately entered into counsel, in ye which it was determined by the whole
consent of his Captains, that they should fight with those Moors, and that they
should go in their boats, for that their ships could not come near unto them,
by reason they were within the Bar. And for that the enemies were many, that
therefore they should do what they could to close with the ships, the which as
soon as they had done, they should set the same a fire. This being appointed,
the Captain general with all ye other Captains of the Fleet, did imbarke
themselves in their boats, the which were in all xv. in the which all the
soldiers of the Fleet did imbarke themselves, and that with a great courage
for that they went to fight with their enemies. The great provision of the
Moors against so fevv small boats.
These Moors as I said, had their ships within the Bar, lyeng one close by
another, with their stearnes toward the land, and in the most part of them were
many soldiers, ye which were men of color white. Their weapon were bows and
arrows, and also they had much ordinance. And on the land, at the entering of
the bar were placed two pieces of ordinance upon a small bulwark which they
had made. Our men bearing near to this bar, had sight of the Captain
general, and how the Caruells were somewhat far off the shore, and that they
came not, for that ye wind was but small, and therefore were perforce driven to
return back for them, and to bring them by force of the oar within the
Bar, for to succor their boats. The other Captains (although they saw him
return) went forward by force of the oar, and at the entering of the Bar,
the Pellets fell as though it had rayned amongst them. But for all this they
entered, shooting of all their Ordinance. But as their enemies were far more
then they, so their arrows were without number. And for that our men by reason
they were somewhat low under their ships, were open without any defense, therefore
did they receive great hurt, not only by their ordinance, but also by their
arrows. Here as it appeared, was all the force of the battle: and for all
the stoutnesse that was showed by the enemies, yet our men entered into the
mids of all the multitude of the shot, by force of the oar, in such sort yt
it appeared as though the boats did fly, It had been better to have called upon
God to have succored them in that extremytye,
the men crying out S. James, S. James, and with yt they laid those ships
aboard: ye first yt laid any ship aboard was Tristim de la Silua, as soon as
he was within the bar. And as ye men of this ship were many, so they did shoot
such abundance of arrows and threw so many stones, yt they made our men put
off, who being off did immediately close with another, in y^ which for that
there were not so many, they boorded the same in despite of the Moors for all
their stoutnes, in ye which were some of them slain, and those that remained
alive leapt for fear into the water and swam away. About ye same time yt
Tristim de la Silua had laid this ship a board, Alonso de la cocta did the
like unto another, which he took to be ye Admiral, of ye which a Turk was
Captain with all his company, which were many. And at the boording of this
ship, were thrown such a multitude of stones and darts, that it was a wonder
to see. It chanced that before our men came to this ship, the enemies shooting
at them with a piece, ye which was lieng upon the upper deck, with ye
recoyling it rent out a piece of the ship side, so yt there was made so great a
hole, and the enemies not regarding it, thought it more needful to succor yt
forepart of their ship. And when our boat came hard a board ye same side where
this hole was, our men did enter by the same. The first that entered, was
Alonso Lopes Master, and another Aluoro Lopes, who was ye things servant, and
is now town Clarke in Santaren, with (...) others. These altogether with those
yt came afterward so fought with their enemies, that in the same conflict there
were many slain, others hid themselves under the hatches, and also others lept
into ye water, at ye which time the most part of them were drowned, for that
they were laden with shirts of male. Immediatelye one Pero Alonso de Aguylar
laid another ship a board, having in his company Lyonel Cotinuo, and also
Edwarte Pacheco, Vasco Caruallo, Antonyo de Saldano, and Ruy Lorenso, who all
behaved themselves very valyauntly. The Mores for fear leap into the sea, and
drown themselves.
And as soon as they had taken this ship, they immediately set the same a
fire, and it took the same very furiously, so that thereby their enemies were
so exceedingly afeard, that the most part of them leapt into the water and
drowned themselves. While this was a doing, thither came the Captain general,
with the Caruells, and being entered within the Bar, he left them. Then one
of the pieces that were on the land was shot off with a pellet, which struck
the Caruell of Pedro Raphael in such sort, and in such a place, that with the
same were three of his men slain and ten sore hurt, and for lack of wind,
the floude carried him under the forecastle of a ship, of those that were not as
yet laid aboard, the which had many men. And for that the ship was higher
then the Caruell, who had the same under his sprit sail, therefore the enemies
did enter, and handeled our men very ill, for that they altogether did set upon
them. Also there was another piece shot, with the which the Master of the ship
was slain, being at the helm governing the Caruell, which being thus left at
randon, before that there came any other to the helm, the Caruell fell upon
certain Rocks, where she remained till the battle was ended. The Captain
general viewing the danger that Pedro Raphael was in, commanded him to be
succored, and so it was done. Then our men entering into the Caruell, the
which was full of Moors, they behaved themselves so valyantly, Here was a
great slaughter of the Portingals in respect of other battles sought.
that they made them fly away, but notwithstanding all our men that were
within ye Caruell were sore hurt. In the mean space, all the ships of the
enemies were burnt, and this also at the last, in the which was burnt great
store of Merchaundise, for that the same was laden. Which was done the rather,
for that upon the land there were many of the enemies which were assembled
together. And for that of our men there were many hurt, the Captain general
came his way with all his Captains toward their ships, where he found that
there were slain of our men xxv. and hurt an hundred and xxvii. men. But for
all this the victory was great. For over and besides the burning of the
ships with all their riches, the which was much, the Captain general was
given to understand by the Moors of Cananor, (to the which place from thence
he went) that there were slain in this battle two thousand men. With this
spoil the king of Calicut remained so ill contented, that from that time for a
good while after, he could not restore himself, for that his loss was great,
besides that the Moors went from Calycut, by reason whereof there was so great
necessity and lack of victuals there, that the city remained almost
uninhabited.

Of the safe arrival of the Captain General at Lishborne, and of the great
honor the king Don Manuel gave to Edwarte Pacheco. chap. 80.
THe next day after, the which was the first day of January, the Captain
General departed toward Cananor, for that there he went to take in the rest
of his lading. And being there arrived, the Factor gave him to understand of
the great victory that he had gotten in Pandarane, and how the Moors were very
pensive for the same, suspecting that from thence forth all our men might
remain in the Indias, The ^^^ber of ships and men, which were left in the
Indias with Manuel Telez the Captain general*
and that without fear. For as their pride was before this victore great, so
their pretense was always thought to be, to kill both the Factor, and all
those that remained with him. The like tale also did the king of Cananor
always tell. The Captain General being ready to depart, before his going
he made an Oration unto Manuel Telez, and those that remained with him touching
that which they should do, laieng before them the great service that Edwarte
Pacheco had done, and therefore he would give him no greater a Fleet then
Francisco de Alburquerque left, and an hundred fighting men in it. But after
that he was departed, there were in the Indias no more wars, for that the
king of Calycut remained as in case aforesaid. The Captain general being
departed from Cananor toward Portingale, he arrived at Mylinde the first day of
September, where without coming a land, he sent Antonio de Saldanua to ye
city, for many rich prises which he had left there, and had taken before at
the Cape Quarda^um, where he went toward the Indias. And from thence he
directed his course toward Quiloa, to recover there y^ kings tribute which ye
king would not pay. From thence he departed the tenth day of Februarye, without
chauncing unto him any thing worth the writing, arrived at Lishborne the 22.
day of June. 1525. with two ships more then he carried out with him, 1525.
when he went toward the Indias. All these were laden with great store of
riches, for the which the king Don Manuel gave him great honor, Indeed this
Edvvarte Pacheco well deserved great honor and co^mendacio^ for his service*
and the like he did to Edwarte Pacheco, after yt he understood what good
service he had done him in the Indias, and how by his means the Factorie was
there maintained, and also the credit of his power. And for that all men should
have knowledge of so notable service, immediately upon thursday next after the
Captain generals arrival, was commanded to be made a solemn Procession, as
they use on Corpus Christi day, in the which he went from ye high church, unto
Santo Domingus, carieng with him Edwarte Pacheco. In this Church there was a
Sermon, made by the Bishop of Vizew called Don Diego Ortis, who brought in by
order, all that Edwarte Pacheco had done in the wars against the king of
Calycut. This feast was not only kept in Lishborne, but also in Algaruy, and
in all the cities and notable towns of Portingale, which was so done by the
kings commandment. Moreover, he wrote of the same unto the Pope, by Don Joan
Sutill, which was then Bishop of Sa^in, who had the carriage of those letters.
Besides y^, he sent the same to many christian Princes, yt they might know of
those notable acts and victories, being such a thing, as within these our days
no prince has done ye like for his subjects.
