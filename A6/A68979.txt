TO THE RIGHT Honorable sir Robert Carre, Knight, Viscont Rochester, Earl of
Somerset, Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, and one of his
Majesty's most honorable privy Counsel.
IF in the great affairs of the kingdom, wherein (under our excellent Head)
your Lordship is worthily employed as a principal member, there be any leisure
left from the business of your high place, It may then please your Lordship to
cast a favorable aspect upon the humble Labors of such whom Fortune, and
their mean deseruings keeps under in the obscure rank of Poverty. Amongst
whom, I have presumed to write this little Book, as a Discoursiue Treatise
upon the Miseries of Russia, occasioned by the late foreign and intestine
war in that Country, which I have adventured to present unto your Honors
view (if a precious eye may look upon a woorthlesse object) and it is not the
meanest virtue, to respect the poorest fortune: for take away goodness from
great men: to whom shall the poor flee for refuge? I have therefore made bold
to shroud it under the Patronage of your Honor, which I wish may still
transcend, until with your high worth it hold correspondencie. And that those
holy Nuptiallbands, whereby you are now honorably lincked into the Noble House
of Norfolk, even by the Sovereign appointment of the most high God, beyond
the subordinate power of Destiny, may till death prove indissoluble, more hard
to be untwined, then that Gordious knotte, wherein lay infoulded the fate of
Asia, That you may live long most happy, as you are now most worthy, both in
your high Style, State, Place, Fortune, and a Kings favor.

Your Honors in all humble duty, HENRY BRERETON.

The War and Miseries of Rushia.
CHAP. 1.
Demetrius the last of that name, after the death of his father Basilius,
succeeds him in the Empire, he distrusteth his own people, and many of his
Nobility, and strives to strengthen his estate by marriage with a young Lady
near in blood to Sigismond king of Poland.

OF all the accidents that I have read or heard of in the oppression of any
State or Kingnome whatsoever, either for the present or precedent ages, there
has none in my opinion been found so sudden, strange and variable, with
occurrants so doubtful, and events so fatal, both to Prince and People, to
the inuader and the invaded, with such deuastation of Country, depopulation of
Towns, combustion of Cities, such deflowrings, rauishemnts, murders, and
horrible treasons, fire, sword, and famine, the tragic executioners of these
miseries, plots and stratagems devised in hell by devils, and acted by men on
earth: as has happened of late years, and is not yet concluded between
Sigismond now King of Poland, Charles King of Swethland, and Demetrius the
last of that name, called the great Duke of Muscouia, or Emperor of Russia.

And this unhappy country, which before flourished in great wealth, state,
pleasure and peaceable commerce with strangers, no war at hand, nor none
toward, but such as no man looked for, was on the sudden, before a man's mind
could think in such a case of a kingdoms alteration, made the woeful Scene
and public stage whereon so many bloody parts have been acted on all hands,
as have brought wretchedness to the people living, and prepared misery for the
child unborn: which war well considered. God never gave unto the world a
more memorable example, either in what vnsurety stands the state of any
Kingdom or Nation that is not propt and supported by the high hand of Heaven,
or what miseries and calamities succeed in the progress of such bloody and
dangerous intendments, to a people so secure. And finally, what end follows
such treasonable and despiteous cruelty, as the lamentable sequel of this
history shall declare.

You shall therefore understand that Demetrius, the last of that name, Emperor
of Rushia, after the death of his father Basilius, called for his stearne and
austere government, as well by strangers, as his own natural subjects, the
great Tyrant of Rushia succeeded him, both in the Empire and hatred of his
subjects: For notwithstanding that Demetrius was a most excellent Prince, framd
even in the prodigality of Nature, endued with many commendable parts, and
hereyicke virtues, in the flower of all his youth and beauty, which commonly
the people do much esteem full of rich hope and expectation. Yet such was the
hatred they bare unto his father, that not dying with his death, it lived still
in his issue, and proved in short time the confusion of this Prince, who
(setting aside his haughty disposition) which seemed to be inherent in him by
Nature, he was otherwise a most absolute Prince, noble in mind, and of a kingly
presence.

He having thus by his fathers death obtained, but not established himself in
the Empire, devised the best means he could for the assurance of his estate,
which by reason of his subjects minds (being Alians to him) and many also of
the Nobility (which for his fathers sake also bare him no affection) stood very
fickle: Amongst which, there was at that time one Kneseuansusce a noble man,
and of great power, that in the Reign of the great Tyrant, being great Master
of the Horse, did also at this time bear many great Offices in the Empire,
which the present King Demetrius, more for fear then love, suffered him to
enjoy. And that state in a Prince must needs be unassured, where the subjects
power shall breed the Princes fear.

This Vansusce in the former Emperors reign, did flily by his bounty and
popularity wind himself into the love and opinion of the people: and because
that some few turbulent broils and dangerous innouasions were by his power
and policy pacified, he was held in great estimation of the Prince, and great
veneration of the Nobility, among which nevertheless there were some that
looking upon his state, with an envious eye, did also with considerate eyes
look into his actions, that springing from ambition more then from countries
care or honorable ends, they found his greatness to be dangerous, and those
acts which carried the name and color of the Emperors good, served under hand
to make way for his ambition, as having only a reference to himself and his
own designs, which Demetrius well perceiving, did nevertheless dissemble,
and coulourably made him fair countenance, as loath (in this green world) to
stir the fire that lay hid in this embers.

This Vansusce was very noble in blood, derived from a long continued
auncestry, honored in many ages with many alliances of the Empire, always held
in great love and estimation of the people, he was in his own person of a
Princely presence, full of affability and Court complement: yet nevertheless
ambitions, cruel, a great dissembler, not letting to kiss whom he meant to
kill, sparing no man's death, whose life withstood his purpose. He was heard
once say to a secret friend of his, that that man was to be held unworthy the
stock of all Nobleness, that yielded his honor to vassalage, whose fortunes
might attain to Sovereignty, whereby discovering his own affections, he made
himself transparant, thinking that if his words were brought in question, his
power was able to defend them. This Vansusces greatness gane principal matter
for the Emperors distrust, knowing well that his ambition once joined with the
peoples hate against him, whose natures are ever wout to follow Nobility, there
might be raised a dangerous faction: for the prevention or meeting whereof, his
friends councelled him to strengthen his unassured estate, by marriage in the
alliance of some foreign Prince: for the furtherance whereof, there was a
young Lady at that time of Princely birth and admirable beauty, as yet
vncontracted in the Court of Poland. Thither with great preparations were
Ambassadors with great expedition sent, the principal of whom was a young
Nobleman, and kinsman to the Empereur, called Tragus, that bare chief place
and honor, who being honorably entertained in Poland, found their dissignes
happily succeed to their desires: for in short time this young Lady was
withal solemnity affianced to this young Prince, a great ioynture granted, a
rich dowry constituted, and the Ambassador richly rewarded, withal speed
richly returned into Rushia.

The Emperor embraces the news, and his kinsman for them kisseth the Ladies
picture, confirms the Articles, exhausteth his treasure, holds himself poor
in the riches of his hope, makes great preparations for his journey into
Poland, still languishing in his desire to see the substance of that beauty,
whose shaddowe only had so incenced his fancy, that that seemed to be true in
him which was written by Plutarch, upon the languishments of Marcus Anthonius,
to Cleopatra Queen of Egypt, that the soul of a Lover lives not in his own,
but in another body.

CHAP. 2.
The Emperor Demetrius descends in person into Poland, with an honorable
train, and is there with all solemnity espoused to the Polish Princess,
returns into Rushia, bringing with him six thousand Poles for his guard.

ALL things being in sumptuous manner prepared, the Emperor Demetrius sets
forward toward Poland, committing the government of his Empire in his absence
to certain of his Noblemen, whom he especially trusted, constituting his
Kinsman Tragus for his Vicegerent. The people stock from all parts to see him,
but neither with outward acclamations, nor inward desires of joy, which
nevertheless he little respected, supposing that this new alliance with Poland
had so strengthened his estate, as he should not need to fear any intestine
innouasion, and from foreign invasions he was secured: howbeit there were some
that judging of future centingents by the present times condition, foresaw
that* this marriage and disposings of it, might hereafter prove his confusion,
as indeed it did: Howbeit we will not now mingle his present pleasures with
unseasonable fears of future troubles, but bring him in all honorable and
delightful manner out of his own territories into the Kingdom of Poland,
where in all places he found his entertainment to answer his estate, and to
exceed his expectation.

After many honorable stays and meetings, with many Princes and Nobles of
Poland, he came at last to Court, the King lying then at Craccow, the chief
City in Craconia, and the principal Seat of the Kingdom, here he found all
the honors that his heart could desire, and saw the rarest beauties that his
eyes could behold: but that which most pleased him, was the sight of her, whose
beauty at first sight did so ravish him with astonishment, that his eyes and
other parts with outward complements, were driven to executs his tongues
office, in discovering his inward thoughts: for he wanted words to express his
Joy.

Here feasting the time, and his own desires with banquets, imbracements,
dances, and other amorous delights, at last, the long wished for day appeared,
wherein the solemnity and authority of the Church, should consumate their
hopeful longings with those happy imbrasings, and that true touch of joy that
languishing Lovers feel in the height of pleasure, which then is at the full,
when with simpathy of affection that sweet is mutually tasted between them
with reciprocal desire, as it was betwixt these two Lovers, in whom no
compulsary consent did enforce marriage: neither was there any incompacible
blood between them to ouer-sway or dull affection: for they were both of
equal years, and both of them the most perfect and absolute frames of nature,
that lived at that time in that part of the world. But at last, all things
being finished with the time for this Princely marriage, they begin to prepare
for their departure, a new desire therein stirring them both, him to reuiew his
native Kingdom, and her to behold that land whereof she was now styled
Empress.

The King and Queen of Poland, a great part of the Nobility, and the richest
beauties of the Court accompany them to the Frontiers of Rushia, the
highways, towns and villages being strewed with flowers, and sweet smelling
herbs, as if the ground had seemed too base to carry these Princely
personages, the people flocking from all parts to see the blazing Comets of
these two kingdoms, whose beauties attracted all men's eyes with wonder to
behold them.

At last, the day of parting came, wherein these two young Lovers having taken
their leaves, with several tokens of joy and sorrow, held on their way by
their appointed Iournals, first to Smalensco, the chief City in the Dukedom
of Seueare, where the Emperors Kinsman Tragus in honorable manner met them,
here staying awhile to rest and solace themselves, within few days they
departed, holding on their conrse, from thence to the great City of Mosco,
where by the directions of the Prince Tragus they were with all State and
Magnificence entertained.

Here they lived a while in all delights and pleasure. Who would have thought
that this Sun thus shining but in his morning beauty, could so suddenly have
found an Eclipse in this Horizon, even in the highway of his ascending glory.
But O the incertainty of terrene pleasures, this light that brought so great a
luster to so great a Nation, was by the same people, whom it beheld with so
fair an aspect, suddenly extinct by the malignancie of Fate and opposite Envy,
as you shall further hear. The Emperor Demetrius brought with him out of
Poland six thousand Soldiers well appointed, to whom he gave the guard of his
person, distrusting the u^delity of his own subjects, which the rather did
incense the Muscouite against him, and in short time proved the cause of his
utter overthrow.

CHAP. 3.
The Emperors guard of Poles abuse his favor, committing many outrages in the
City, and in short time fall into great hatred with the Muscouite,
Kneseuansusce Iaying hold of this occasion, ioynes with the Muscouite, and
grows discontent.

NOw while the Emperor with his Lady delighted in nothing but what might
please his fancy, spending whole days and nights in Banqueting and Revels,
thinking all safe and secure, the Poles being a people proud in their own
nature, and that pride now doubled in them by the Princes favor, commit
without controlement many outrages in the Mosco, and other places adjoining, so
that by degrees (in short time they came to be extremely hated of the
Muscouite, which Vansusce perceiving would oftentimes complain so far as he
durst to diverse of his friends the Muscouites, both of the Indulgence of the
Prince, and insolency both of the Pole, alleging probability of a Tyranny in
the son, more insufferable then that of his fathers.

Who foresees not says Vansusce, that perceiues any thing, how this new
Alliance with Poland is like to prove fatal to Rushia, who sees not that these
rude beginnings, are certain signs foregoing much greater mischiefs, if they
be not in time prevented, we are scarce now secured of our wives, children and
goods, but that many times they pass the hazard of their barbarous cruelty, if
six thousand Poles keeps us thus in awe, committing such outrages (whereof
there are daily complaints) without controulement, what will their greater
numbers do, whereof there is a continual expectance: the Prince sleeps and
dallies in the delights of his new love forgetting his old friends, his own
people are disesteemed, the Pole has all estimation, no Rushian sues at Court
but (if he will thrive) must have a Pole to his Aduoacte, nothing that is by
the Pole begged, but is by the Prince granted, without respect of common
profit, the principal Offices begin already to be transposed both in Court and
City, what shall we look for but a declination still from bad to worse until
we have lost all, and the Pole has got all.

These words together with their outrages had so incensed the Muscouite that
there wanted but occasion to raise an innovation which vnluckely was soon
after proffered, for a Polish Gentleman casting by chance his eye upon a
Merchants daughter of Mosco, a virgin of excellent bewty, was so infangled in
her love, that having tried all ways for the obtaining his desire by
entreaties, and gifts, and finding still his suite to return in vain, was
nevertheless so ardent in his outrageous lust, that having trained her by
devise into a place of conueniency, where in the pursuit of his desire all
fair ways being denied him, he in a most barbarouse manner ravished her. This
deflowred damsel with great sorrow and heaviness complained to her frinds of
this vile abuse.

When the causes of our griefs exceed all bounds, it works in our minds
diversity of effects, not immoderatly those that follow our ordinary
afflictions, or the customary crosses of fortune, which draw our sighs,
tears, and other common tokens of calamity; but in the excess of grief when
the object there of presents a veiw beyond al patience or sufferance, it so
distracts the mind and astonisheth the senses that reason giving way to sorrow
we fall into a boundless Ocean of the extremest passtons, such was the
inuolued heart with grief in that spectacle of all misery Hecuba Queen of
Troy, who seeing herself betrayed (...) set on fire, her Lord Priame flaine,
her children murdered, and that flower of al beauty Polixena (in the love of
whom that mirror of all knighted Achilles fight) slain in her own arms, by
unrelenting Pirrhus, in the view of these miserable objects she was so far from
finding ease in the utterance ofsorrow, that she lost herself in the Maze and
Labrinth of madness, the like was that of Niobe upon the slaughter of her
seven sons by the Goddess Latona, who in the fight thereof was so astonished
with sorrow, that the Poet fained her turned into a stone, not much unlike was
the state of the friends of this deflowred damsel, who having seen their
daughters tears, and known the cause of her grieuance fell presently from the
passion of sorrow to the passion of rage, and in a furious manner with resolved
purposes but unguided steps ran to Court, complains of this abuse with
frantike and unseemly gesture, set forth the guilt of this abominable fact in
the presence of the Emperor, and after a violent manner, rather commanding
then craving justice, what have we committed (says the father to this wronged
damsel) that we your natural people having been so long brought up under your
Laws, Religion, and Government, should be so far distrusted of our
loyalties, and so much distasted in our affections that you should repose your
self in a strange guard, and expose us to their cruelty. what outrages have
they committed since the coming of your Queen into Mosco, sparing neither
age, sex, nor quality, how many complaints have been made of their abuses, but
no redress; and I the sad father to this deflowred virgin perceive by your
looks that I speak in vain, the way to oppression is plain and open, the
path to Justice is untrodden, the King is a stranger to his subjects and a King
to strangers, the Muscouite held himself wretched under the government of your
father, but we much more under your tyranny, these last words did so incense
the Prince, that with his foot he spurned the father of this damsel from him,
and being by rage wholly transported from reason without any respect, either to
the complainants cause, or the Muscouites discontent, committed him as a
mutiner together with his wife and this wronged damsel to prison, who causing
them there to be laden with Irons, did there by so ouerlade himself with the
hatred of his people, that in short time it proved a burden too heavy for him
to bear, ouer-pressing him so much that it deprived him of his Empire, and in
the end of his life, as the sequel shall declare.

CHAP. IIII.
Vansusce with the aid of the Muscouite rebels, surpriseth the great Castle or
Palace of Mosco, kills all the Poles in one night, in this garboile the
Emperor is bruted to be slain, but with the aid of a trusty servant escapes
secretly with his (...) disguised.

THe news being spread abroad the great City, of the usage of his Merchant,
his wrongs and unjust imprisonment, together with his wife and daughter, the
Muscouite in more open manner bewray their discontents on to another, and all
against the Pole, so far forth that they begin to mutiny, flocking togther in
great Companies with minds of resolution to revenge themselves for the wrongs
received, which the Pole understanding, keep within the great Palace, not
daring to stir abrdad: The Prince looking (but too late) into the danger,
imploie certain Noble men of his Court, such whom he knew to be gracious with
the people for the quieting of these tumults, by whose care and industry in
short time they seemed to be pacified, not appeased, the Merchant, his wife,
and daughter delivered, not contented, a punishment upon the offender imposed,
not executed, a satisfaction promised, not performed, so that this fire was for
a time smothered, not extinguished, which shortly after brake forth in such
biolent manner, that the flame thereof had well near consumed the whole Empire.

The Prince being much perplexed in mind with these garboiles and continual
dangers of innovation, demands council of his friends what were best to do,
rather for prevention of mischief then pacification of the people, the best
counsel was given to appease; to apply himself to a gentle and debonaire
behavior toward his subjects, that obedience was better from love then fear,
to send back the Pole, into his Country, to betake the guard of his person to
his own people and to apply his government to the nature of the Muscouite. But
the worst, is followed which is to fore-stall to make his Guard stronger with
the aid of the Poles to fortify his Palace and other places of command in
the Mosco, to rule by force not love, and utterly to disgrace and distrust the
Muscouite, to this end, and for these purposes were there messengers secretly
sent into Poland for ten thousand soldiers more to be entertained under his
pay for the saueguard of his person.

When distrust once grows in a Princes mind and hatred once settled in the
subjects hearts, they are hardly removed, as was well found in this Prince and
people, howbeit if at that time he had followed the best counsel to have
cassiered the Pole and entertained the Muscouite for his Guard, undoubtedly he
might long have rained a happy Prince over a happy people, and prevented
infinite mischiefs that followed even to ye utter destruction of himself and
great desolation in the Empire: And thus in the beginning ends the last act of
his comike Scene, and now begins the first act of his tragedy, and as the
first was short and full of pleasure so this last was long and more full of
misery, for his old adversary Kneseunnsusce understanding of the close dispatch
of the Emperors messengers into Poland for this new supply foreseeing that the
Prince would then be to strong for him, except he should openly raise his
powers, and so put it to the hazard of a battle, the end whereof he wist was
doubtful, as well for the number of the Poles that were known to be much
better soldiers then the Muscouite, as also for some few Noble men in Court
both of land and power, whom he knew were fast unto the Prince, and might soon
raise there forces: held it his best for the pursuing of his dessignes to take
the advantage of ye occasion present, and by a sudden surprise with the help
of his friends to make a new slaughter in the Palace and places adjoining not
only of the Poles but also of the Prince himself his chief friends and
followers. To this end and bloody purpose he sends secretly to his friends
and such as he specially trusted in the City to be in a readiness armed at an
hour appointed, and as the Poet says, Tenebris audacia crescit: the night was
held fittest for this deed of darkness, and the Palace it self was made ye
public Theater whereon was acted this horrible massacre, the night being come
they flock on all sides to the house of Vansusce, all ways being fore-laide
to prevent intelligence of this bloody project, his friends and followers being
thus assembled together to ye number of ten, or twelve thousand, all armed for
the purpose: Vansusce prepares for this bloody assault, telling them with words
of much encouragement that now ye long looked for time was come, that should
make the Muscouite famous to all posterity in the delivery of themselves from
the cruel tyrany of the Poles, the experiment of whose proud natures and
bloody dispositions they were to well acquainted with in their own particulars,
and that now the hour was come, wherein they might revenge at full the vilde
abuses and intolerable wrongs of this insufferable stranger, and free the
City and the land of so dangerous a Viper, these words of Vansusce, together
with ye credit and opinion that was held of him that spoke them, did so stir
up the spirit of the Muscouite to the enterprise of this attempt, that most of
them with an uniuersall consent of revenge, the rest carried with hate and
desire of spoil ran in disordered troops from the house of Vansusce to the
Palace of the Emperor which was two miles a sunder, now was there one Glasco
a Secretary, and in special trust with ye Emperor, howbeit a most vile
traitor, for being privy to all Vansusces proiects he was ye only means for
their entry into the Palace, this Glasco shall carry the stamp of infamy, and
for ever leave it to his name and memory, who had he been faithful to his
Lord and Master might have discovered this horrible treason, prevented the
infinite mischiefs that followed, preserved the life of his Prince, and
purchased to himself immortal glory.

The entry was made with little resistance into the base Courts, where having
once set foot, they cry out, liberty, liberty, liberty; kill, kill, kill; the
Poles some naked, some weakly armed, according to the shortness of the time,
pass with small defense the cruelty of the enemies swords, and it fell out as
Vansusce had expected, for others that knew not the matter hearing the
Larum-bell rung in the Palace, came from all parts, and understanding that
Vansusce was there in person, without inquiring further fell presently to
execution, killing all they found, as well Muscouite as Pole, that bare office
in the Court; now was there nothing heard in the Palace but a horrible and
confused noise of armor, Horses, and harqubuses; a pitiful cry of all sorts
of people, of all ages and conditions going unto death, and the pitilesse
shoutes of murderers, the Palace died over with blood, to the which (though
having made choice of darkness) they nevertheless set fire to give them light
for the execution of this massacre, two hours murder and rapine make this one
night famous in the infamy of the executioners, to whom also afterward it
proved so fatal, as all of them were enforced to confess that man's blood
split violently, when as the manner thereof, cannot lawfully challenge, the
quallification of justice is odious in his sight; who having created man
according to his own image, sels his blood deerly to the authors of such
effusion, nevertheless this was but the exordium, or entrance, or first, or
least part of this Tragic Scene, for when their way was made into theinward
Courts by fire and sword, they spared none of any degree or calling, every
object they saw in the Court was a subject to their fury.

The Emperor and his Lady being in the heart of the Palace embracing one
another, in great dolor and heaviness determine yet nobly to die together,
whilst a trusty servant of the Emperors found away and means for their
escape, the Prince in the habit of a slave, the Lady in man's apparel, thus in
great sorrow and fear these two young lovers in this disguise took hand in
hand, and with their faithful guide by his direction past through by-waies out
of the Palace, then burning about their ears: he deserueing for his care and
duty to his Prince, no less fame and memory then that pattern of all piety,
Aeneas did carrying upon his shoulders his old father, Anchises, even through
the flames of Troy.

CHAP. V.
Demetrius with his Empress flies to the Dukedom of Collooge, and finds
entertainment, Vansusce bruits him dead, and causes one like him to be carried
through the City murdered, the Muscouite believes it.

THus these two young Princes sprung from the lines of Kings, in the chief
pride of their flowring youth, and beauty, in the height of all their state and
dignity, in the midst of al their pleasures and delights, from the happy
society of their friends and great Allies, are now by the vilde treachery of
Vansusce, their sworn subject, and forsworn vassaile, brought from their
Imperial greatness to so wretched and miserable a state, as not the meanest
in the Empire would now willingly change fortunes and conditions with them.

But to return to their tragic story: They having by the aid of their
trusty guide past the fears and dangers of the Palace, took the River of
Volga, in a little boat, the Prince himself helping his trusty servant to row
down the stream, O what a piteous sight it was to behold a Prince that but
the day before held a Septer of so rich royal and spacious a kingdom served
in all state and majesty, attended on with Nobles, and infinite numbers of men,
to be now tugging at a simple Oar, and laboring for his life to preserve her,
whom above his life, and all the world he preferred, and of all that he
inioyed but three hours before, to have only this remnant left that he might
call his own, his desolate Queen, his faithful servant, and two silly Oars,
and a little Boat.

But holding on our course, we must publish to the world those dolorous
occurrents, and heavy calamities that followed, to fill up this sad Scene of
sorrow with matter more tragical then that of Seneca, in the wretchedness of
Locasta, or that of Homer in the miseries of Hecuba: thus this poor rich
remain of Rushia, these two precious jewels plucked rudly from their golden
frame, these two great personages, in this little Boat, easing themselves in
this heavy burden of care by the natural participation of sorrow, and
comforting themselves in the sight each of other, hold on their course toward
the Dukedom of Colloga, some fourscore verse, as the Rushe calls it, from the
great City of Mosco, which is about threescore miles English, a place for the
natural situation so defensible, by reason of Rivers, Rocks, and Castles,
that with an Army it is well near inaccessible, Demettius having here safely
set his foot, the whole Dukedom did generally entertain him, some also of
the Nobility, and many of his old seeuants that had past the dangers of the
Palace, and the tyranny of Vansusce fled unto him, in whose sight he
comforted himself with this, that he was not utterly forsaken, thanking
almighty God upon his knees, that his state thorough this treason was not
reduced to so low an ebb but that he might yet live, to out live this misery,
and since he was in this short time raised from the attendance of one servant
and a little Boat, to the possession of many servants and a whole Dukedom, he
might also afterward, by the revolution of time, and fortune, recover and
repossesse his whole Empire, checking his present fears with the hope of
future contingents, striving thus to make a body of a limb, and to beguile the
actual condition of his fortunes with imaginary conceits of better: But we
will now leave this cross star Prince in the sorry comfort of his wan hopes,
building new Castles in the air, while his fatal enemy Vansusce possesses
his old Castles in the Empire, and letting him rest a while after the unrest of
that dismal night, we will now return where we left Vansusce burning, or
spoiling that great Castle and Palace of Mosco, the royal Seat of many
Emperors in many precedent ages, which had been a building many years, and
was thus miserably in one night destroyed, or so much defaced, that to this day
it is not re-edin^ed: now must we bring upon the stage Usurpation attainders,
forfeitures and confiscation of Lands and Goods, plots, and stratagems to
supplant, polices, and devices to establish a Crown unjustly gotten, upon an
Usurpers head, that is never at rest, or seldom sleeps in quiet.

Vansusce notwithstanding that every thing succeeded according to his desire:
but that which was the maine of his project, the flaughter of the Prince
Demetrius, whose escape none but his trusty friends knew of, proceeds in his
purposes to make himself Emperor, albeit he knew that he had no title
thereunto, nor color like to any.

The mind of man is infinite in opinion and weening, which being once set upon
ambition, nothing can stay or limit her adventures, as appeared in Vansusce, in
whose way lay two great stumbling blocks, the first was the escape of the
Prince, the other was the life and greatness of his Kinsman Tragus, who was
also great in the peoples opinion him must Vansusce needs remove, or he finds
a greater enemy exposd then Demetrius that was expeld, this must be done
secretly, and upon the sudden, and there was no time slackt, for three hours
before the appearing of the day that followed this fatal night, a brother of
Vansusces, whose name was also Demetrius, was sent to surprise him with five
hundred horse, he lying then at a house of pleasure in the country, some
fifteen miles from the City, and to bring him prisoner to the Mosco, where by
form of trial he was to pass such censure as was preiudicated for him, in
those false crimes and imputations already set down to be suggested and
enforced against him: for he durst not by reason of the peoples favor proceed
against his life, but by process of Law, and because he knew also that it
would be a hard matter to surprise him in his house, he causes a letter of
Credence to be counterfeit in the Emperors name, the tenor whereof was only
this, That there was some matter of import that craved his present aid at
Court, and that he should set all other business aside, and make what speed he
could thither, the trust of this letter was committed to that vilde traitor
Glasco, as being found the fittest for this negotiation: howbeit there will
come a time wherein he that is now an Agent, shall prove also a Patient in this
bloody tragedy, when that treasonable blood that now flows in his veins,
shall be let out even by the hand of him whom he now obeyes, but we will leave
him now, and Vansusces brother Demetrius, to their poasting journey, and
return to the Castle at Mosco, where Vansusce having beheld many dead
Carkases, found one that in years, favor, and other lineaments of his body,
was very like the Emperor, Vansusce lays hold upon this occasion, and having
princely apparrelled this dead counterfeit, caused it to be published, that the
Emperor Demetrius was slain: for manifestation where, he causes this
counterfeit to be laid upon a Beer; and with great State to be carried
barefaced through the great City, to their State-house, or common hall, he
accompanying the body in person, the people flocking from all parts to see him,
believing steadfastly that it was he, but no man bestowing a sigh or funeral
tear upon him, such is the nature of the vulgar.

CHAP. 6.
The counterfeit body is buried for the Emperor Demetrius, with the state and
solemnity of a Prince, Tragus is suddenly surprised and brought prisoner to the
Mosco.

VAnsusce being come into the public Hall, coulorably attired in black, being
in himself of a Princely personage and presence, maiestically ascended up into
a high Throne that was suddenly erected for him, the supposed body of the
Prince being laid before the people, where after silence proclaimed, he spoke
after this manner unto them, with a sad settled countenance and an audible voice.
I cannot tell with what passions or affections of grief and sorrow, my dear
Countrymen, this dead Prince whom we lately called our sovereign Lord and
Emperor, lies buried in your hearts, but unto me it is the saddest sight, and
the most woeful object that ever my vnhahpy eyes beheld, of whose blood, as the
immortal God can witness of my clear heart and innosence, so I protest by
the majesty of him before whom I stand, that with your allowance and consent, I
would punish with torture, to all example, this worse then Parricide, were it
in the person of mine own brother, though done in ignorance, as in such
unhappy garboiles many such chances happen: If probable witness could be
produced against him, for it is not fit the earth should bear the murderer of
his Prince, but because that matters uncertain cannot be certainly disposed,
we must leave him to his judgment that knows as well the intensions as
actions of man, it only rests that we perform our last duties to the dead,
his funeral Rites and Obsequies, which I desire may be with all solemnity
accomplished, in whose sudden and untimely death, because we have lost a hope
of a continued line for succession in the Empire, and that by the flaughter of
the Poles we have drawn a great and dangerous enemy, it behooues you to make
choice of such a one to govern, whose wisdom and valor may be able to
maintain the State and Majesty of the Empire, and also meet with those
opposite occurrents that does malign it, but first of all, and chiefest of
all, it behooues you to cut of all occasions of civil and intestine war, for
prevention whereof we have this morning sent for the Princes kinsman Tragus, as
well to answer to such supputations of crime as shall be objected against him,
as also in this dangerous time to be disposed of by your wisdoms, naught else
at this time our dolorous tongue can discourse of but the Princes funerals,
which we will hasten to solemnise: and with that word he wipt his eyes, the
people were so far from any tokens of sorrow, that they fell presently to
acclamations of joy, clapping their hands and throwing up their hats, crying
Vansusce, Vansusce, God save Vansusce.

It is a thing worth the observation to note and mark what diversity of shapes
hypocrisy puts on, Haec simulata sanctitas haec dissimulata iniquitas, how
many miles distant are the words and thoughts of a dissembler, how many
unknown Regions betwixt his tongue and heart, but admit they lie close for a
while they will be discovered when his justice shall be turned outward, and
though his treasons have for a time undeserved and unsuspected passage, as
carring an outward gloss fair and remarkable, yet the day will come when he
shall render an account of his unjust Stewardship, and surrender up and restore
back all those false titles and honors which murder, perjury, and horrible
treason helps him to put on, when by being truly pulled down from the height
of his false greatness he shall be advanced as a mark of terror to all
traitors and treasons, in the mean time, and at all times his name and memory
shall be held odious and infamous to God and all good men, to whom humane
society and virtue is had in veneration.

Not long after the living Princes obsequies were with all state and honor
solemnized in the person of another, who though he were of base birth, and
obscure parentage, and perhaps did never any act memorable in his life, was
nevertheless in his death honored with a Princes funeral, and buried in a
Sepulcher of Emperors.

But we must now return where we left with Vansusces brother, Demetrius and
the traitonr Glasco, who many days before this counterfeit obsequies had
betrayed and surprised the young Prince Trahus, which in this manner was
effected: early in the morning a little before the breaking of the day, they
came within sight of the Castle, where having found within a mile thereof a fit
place by reason of certain copses of wood, and other shrubbish, to plant an
Ambuscado, Demetrius took the advantage thereof, lying there close with his
men to entrap the Prince upon the way whilst this Achitophel, this Judas, that
had before betrayed his Lord, in a most abominable manner goes now also to
betray his kisman, to whom before he had been much obliged, but no benefit
received, or pleasure done can stay a treacherous heart bent to mischief, for
that it is altogether transferred unto the end it aims at, and neither
respects the way it takes, nor the course it holds, though never so foul or
indirect, he comes like sly Ulysses, that stole Paladium out of Troy, with a
fair face, but a foul mind, a smooth countenance, but a rotten heart;
knockes at the Castle gate, and is let in, he understands that the Prince is a
sleep, who God knows little drempt of the fatal night his kinsman the
Emperor endured, nor of this unhappy day wherein he himself is to be
betrayed. Now because that Glasco had told the servants of the house that his
business was of suah import, that he had itin charge given not to forbear his
rest, they waked the Prince before his hour, who understanding of Glascoes
coming was very glad, and sent for him into his bedchamber, so clear and
true a mind has innocence upon the Anuile when treason and mischief is in
the Forge. But this vilde traitor Glasco being entered the Chamber, he in very
humble manner salutes the Prince, and delivers many suggested complements,
together with these counterfeit letters from the Emperor, the Prince with a
cheerful and unsuspected countenance, gives him his hand, bids him welcome,
demands of the Prince his health, and the news at Court, all is delivered in
fair manner and colored over with dissembled words, the Prince believes all,
and distrusteth nothing, receives and reads the letter without suspicion,
making himself ready for his iourny to Mosco: Thus whilst the tongue and the
heart of truth are in one line parallel, the heart and tongue of treason are as
far sundered as the Poales; such distance there is from their artike words to
the antartike purposes: the Prince is soon ready, kisseth his fair Lady,
making more have then good speed to go on with this traitor to the Mosco;
from whence he is never to return, nor ever to behold his wife again; she
weeps at parting, as bedewing his hidden fate with her open tears, whether of
present love, or fore signifying sorrow, they mount on horseback, and with
half a doozin of the Princes followers they post toward the Mosco, till they
came within the compass of the Ambuscado, that all this while lay as still as
midnight, the larum being given on the sudden, they surprise him and detain
him prisoner, there could be no resistacne, the Prince seeing himself thus
vildly betrayed, and by him also whom he especially trusted, bouldly desired to
know the cause, and whether it was the Emperors pleasure that he should be
thus held in captivity, they answered him churlishly, that he should know the
rest at his coming to Mosco, and when he began in goodly terms, as he was an
excellent well spoken man, to bewray his innocense, they stayed not the end of
his speech, but rudely put him forward, at which the Prince sighed, but it
booted not: All this was done within view of the Princes house, and in the
Ladies sight: Now judge all you houourable dames, that love your Lords and
husbands with entire affections, with what heart the sad eyes of this desolate
Lady could behold this miserable object, to see her husband thus betrayed
within her view; such was the sorrow of that ever memorable Roman Lady
Cornelia, wife to Pompey the great, when from a far off she saw her Lord and
husband in a little Boat betrayed and slain, by the treacherous Councellers
and bloody ministers of that perjured Prince Ptolomie King of Egypt, when
after his overthrow in Thessalie he put himself upon his protection. And this
poor Ladies sorrows were the greater because she neither knew the cause,
their purposes, nor the means to help him, but we must leave her in her
passions and follow him in his captivity, whom they soon brought in a poasting
journey to Mosco, and lodged him in a strong prison.

CHAP. 7.
Tragus is arraighned, condemned, and judged unjustly in the Mosco, who out of
the greatness of his mind, to mock Vansusces tyranny kills himself.

NOw were their daily counsels and consultations held in the City, concerning
the progress of this business with this Nobleman, by Vansusce and those of
his secrets: who ^oo^e grew to be powerful by: reason of his strong Guards and
plurality of friends, that from all parts flocked unto him. The day was soon
appointed for this young Lords trial, not from his known innocence to clear
him, but from their preiudicated doombes to confound him; the public place of
judgment was appointed, the Theater upon which must be acted this Gentleman's
tragedy, thither at the day set down comes Vansusce in a Princes Roabe,
together with his friends, allies, and a strong guard of soldiers, the
principal Officers in the City accompanying him, and having all taken their
places, this Princly prisoner is brought in before them who with a cheerful
and vnaffrighted countenance beholds them all. The allegations of treason
objected against him were, that by his procurement the last war with the
Tartars was commenced that cost more treasure and blood then the victory was
worth, that by his solicitation that unhappy marriage with the Polish Princes
was mediated and concluded, that the Polish Guard was by his means brought in,
by which, so many outrages were committed that they were driven to take the
course they did for their slaughter, in which the Emperor himself past an
unhappy destiny, the guilt of whose death was laid upon him as being the
original, though not the efficient cause thereof, that the bringing in of
tenthousand Poles more was by his counsel urged, that the Princes treasure was
by his prodigal profuse of money much wasted, that he had allowed the title of
the Dukedom of Severe, to the Crown and Kingdom of Poland, with other
matters not so much as thought upon, to all which, the Prince answered so fully
and so nobly as every impartial ear found his innocence; howbeit truth never
told her tale but envy was either ready to wrong herby suggestion, or falsehood
by subornation, for unjust witnesses were produced against him, by whose
testimony this innocent Prince was condemned. Vansusce then rising from his
Throne, began with a studied and premeditated speech after this manner, I cannot
tell my loving Countrymen in what terms, or with what words I shall proceed
in judgment against this Nobleman, late kinsman and near Alley unto our
dear Sovereign Lord the Emperor, for when I think of the times past and
compare them with the present, the thought and consideration thereofso strikes
me with astonishment, my mind being diversely distracted betwixt my Countries
care and this Noble-mans respect, that I stand divided in my judgment, the one
pleading rigor, the other pity, what I shall definatiuly set down in censure
for him or against him; first give him his due, who does not sorrow that so
noble a Gentleman, so fully stuffed with such excellent parts of mind, of so
admirable composure, and constitution of body in the prime of his youth, and
beauty in the pride of his state and pleasures, in the solace and comfort of
his wife and children, his ouer-heedlesse actions, and ouer-weening conceit,
his own greatness, in abusing the Princes favor, should now make him
unworthy of his life, by reason of the states present condition: whereas
otherwise his life should have been most desired. For mine own part, I would I
had not lived at all, or at least, not till this time, wherein saving my
countries care, and the entire respect and affection I bear to all your lives
and safeties, I am otherwise even against the consent of my soul, and my best
genious, enforst to pronounce peremptory sentence of judgment against such a
man, to whom but of late I gave place to in honor.

For thus say my private thoughts to my common cares, where Nobility,
greatness, a Princes favor, or what excellent parts or qualities soever,
either of body or mind, be in the same subject that owes them transferred unto
it self without respect of common good, to the which he owes a duty, he grows
not only an unprofitable, but also a dangerous member to that Commonwealth,
and where from such a mind there be acts committed, though but criminal, and
fears depending of greater consequence in this case, it is more then a
politic or national Law, it is Religious Justice, and the service of our
God, to take away the life of such greatness, and make it the peoples
sacrifice: and therefore with your consents, since things cannot otherwise
stand, or be established, I give him over to the rigor of the Law, and the
ministers thereof.

All this while this captive Prince although he saw how closely and indirectly
every thing was carried, and had heard during the time of his imprisonment, the
supposed death of the Emperor, the murder of the Poles, and many of great
place and office in the Palace, actions so bloody and so fatal that albeit be
knew the world to be full of mischief, and the paths thereof trodden with
vnsanctifyed feet, yet he thought there wanted that venomous matter in the
mind of man to beget, breed, and bring forth such hideous and horred murders,
he does yet nevertheless, neither in the conceit of these inhumane massacers
past, nor in the iudurance of his own unavoidable miseries present show tokens
of any fear or affrightment, but with the same countenance he held before in
his prosperous estate, he now beheld the tiranous authors, and bloody actors of
his tragedy, so nobly had the inward virtues of his mind framed and composed
the outward actions and gestures of his body: And thus with words as bold, and
as undaunted as his looks, he spoke in this manner unto them.

I have strained withal my best within me, to hear and bear patiently all
your unkind handlings, unjust presumtions, furious Inforcements; your malicious
and manifold appliments, foul wrestings, and impossible constructions, and all
to make me seem to be a member dangerous to the state, to take away my life as
a common enemy, which only must be removed to make smooth the way to your
present ends and intendments, for this cause was the true noble blood of my
royal Lord and kinsman shed, to make you grow up in this false greatness, I
speak to the Vansusce, whose inward saul knows my innocence in all my
accusations, and that all this show of Law is but a form, a mere ingine, or
device to set a gloss upon your horred murders past; and to take away my life
by a pretext of justice, which you pursue in malice, have I shown my self
dangerous to my Country, when in the last wars with the Tartars I so little
regarded mine own life, that I spent most of her blood in that action, and
returned victorious against the eye and opinion of all that saw and knew the
danger of that day; did I wrong my Country when with your consents and
allowances I made that honorable contract with the Polish Princes; was that
the Treasure I exhausted in that expedition: when mine own private Coffers are
yet empty with that charge. For the Polish guard, it was rather my enforced
consent, then my voluntary counsel, or approuement, for the title of the
Dukedom, with the rest of the Articles, which I scorn to repeat, the great
God of my hope knows me to be as free either in action, or intention, as he
knows the Vansusce to be guilty of these horrid treasons; I do not plead mine
innocence to save my life, for that is foredoomed by an unchanged decree, but
only to ease my heart of an ouerburdening wait of grief which your base
wrongs, and false wouen injuries have contracted there, (and it, is one comfort
yet that I am suffered to speak, I do not rail either against thy tyranny,
or the maleuolence of my stars, there is no man greater then his destiny,
neither have I set the guard of virtue so weakly within me, against the spite
of Fortune, or your malice, but that my spirit and resolution can suffer,
either in thy inhumaine cruelty Vansusce, or thy unnatural treachery vild
Glasco, or all your hates you unkind Muscouites, or what else is precious unto
me, as the loss of wife and children, deprivation of lands and honors, or
torment, or death, or whatsoever can happen in humanity: All these or what else
is in the power of envy, hate, malice, or tiranouse oppression is beneath me.
Life is not my Paramour, I stand not inamourad of her pleasures, the world has
to me adulterated his fair protestations of love and respect, with the foul
prostetucions of the times mischief, I have seen an end of my fortunes, and
have set an end to all my desires, all the ambition that is left in me is the
hopeful enioyment of a far more glorious kingdom, thither does my soul
aspire, and thither shall my spirit mount before your time prefixed, if there be
any therefore in this assembly that either is at this time, or shall happen
hereafter to rome into the like danger, and would know how to mock Vansusces
tyranny, let him learn it thus by my example: And with that word having closly
drawn a short dagger hid of purpose for this hour, he stabbed himself to the
heart, an a^ though in it self seeming desperate and full of horror, yet in
circumstance and considerate respects truly noble and full of honor that would
not suffer his opposite and mortal enemeies to triumph over his virtues and
the freedom of his spirit in his end.

The sudden and voluntary death of this Noble man put them all into amasement,
and some there were present and those not of the meaner sort, did for the time
so inwardly sorrow for the hard disaster of the Prince his innocence and
injuries that they made outward manifestation thereof by there tears, which
Vansusce perceiving, and in their general silence a general sadness, that
from thence his Plots and Proiects, might be more narrowly looked into with
considerate eyes, began to look about and to gather his wits together to draw
this inward creeping suspicion from the heart of the Muscocite, upon whose love
and opinion did principally depend the hope and means of his proceedings, he
therefore spoke again unto them so fully for the times condition, so
colorable against the guilty life, and rash death of the Prince, and so
carefully for the security of the state, together with all their safties, that
he soon turned the gentle current of their passionate sorrows into the vast
Ocean of their wonted rage, crying out against the house of Demetrius his name
and family, and in this new humor, like the flattering Jews to Herod after
his Oration to the people, they falsely guild his words with an Angels
eloquence, crying out after their wonted manner, Vansusce, God save Vansusce,
such a turning Phane is the peoples breath, with these much looked for
acclamations the Court was presently dissolved, the dead body of the Prince
carried back to Prison, from whence the next day, it was brought forth again
and poorly buried, making the world to stand at amasement, that the earth
which never fails of means in abundance for a Princes life should now fail
in necessaries for his interre-ment.

CHAP. 8.
The wife of Tragus dies for sorrow his two children are detayned prisoners,
Vansusce is crowned Emperor of Rushia, Demetrius, with the Empress flees into
Poland from whence with a great Army he returns back into Rushia: the war
begins.

AFter this tall Ceader of the Rushian state was, from the mountain of his
greatness, thus pulled down: many lower trees and shrubbes past the like
fortune, for whosoever stood in Vansusces way must be removed, till it was
made smooth from any oblique let for his transcending glory, even to the
maiestike state of the Rushian Empire, treacherous Glasco being the principal
agent, and special instrument for his designs, and Intendments.

But before we set the Crown on this usurpers head, whilst the preparations
be now in framing for his Coronation, we will look a little back into the
wretched state, and miserable condition of this untimely Widdowed Lady, wife to
the late noble Prince Tragus, and his two sons, both so young that they were
not capable of their calamity: To write of this Ladies tears, and her profound
sorrows, were but like a Painter to counterfeit by art the tears of Lucresse
for her enfrost wrong done to Collatyne, or the true bred woes of Porcia for
her dear Lord Brutus, to show outwardly the presentation of such tragike
spectacles, and so to feed the fantasy with imaginary grief, in which
neuertstelesse their is neither life, nor sense of real sorrow.

To leave therefore these tears with her that was the true owner of them, who
presently also leaving the world and the pleasures thereof enclosed hirselfe in
a religious house, where with long fasting, and deep melancholy, spending her
days alone in the exercise of sorrow, in short time she ended her life,
leaving behind her a notable example of love and constancy: his two sons are
yet living, but detained as prisoners by Vansusce, howbeit happily reserved to
better fortunes.

Now is Vansusce arrived at that Haven he a long time did bend his course unto,
even through a Sea of blood, where nevertheless he shall not find that safty
that he expects, for dangerous is the State that is obtained by blood and
treason, as the sequel shall declare, the Imperial Crown of Rushia being now
set upon his head, there fell mischiefs thick, and as the thing evil gotten
is seldom, or never well kept, through all the time of his usurped reign there
never ceased bloody war and slaughter, no not in his own destruction and
captivity for he had scarce time to finish the state and solemnity of his
Coronation, before he heard news of the great preparations in Poland, both to
reueng the treasonable wrongs done to the Emperor, and also the murder of the
Poles, or rather which is most like, Sigismond the King of Poland making these
but colorable pretenses for higher dessignes of another nature, both to
recover the Dukedom of Seueare, to the which he challenged a title, and
further, as the success should follow to invade the whole Empire of Rushia,
and to keep it for himself, to make another entry that way into the Kingdom
of Swethland, such a passage had this civil discention made, even for the
overthrow of the whole state, but we must now return to the lawful Emperor
Demetrius, who being by the happy fortune of his birth a Prince, was now by the
malignant power of his fate a fugitive, for having about some few of his
friends that followed him in all fortunes, he gave them in charge to look
carefully to the keeping of that Dukedom, it being still a receptacle for them
in the worst of danger while he with his unhappy Lady in great danger and
strange disguise together with his trusty servant past from Colloge, and after
a long and weary iourny at last took the River of Ipre, and with safty
recovered the Territories of the Polish Kingdom.

Sigismond having notice of their coming, sends his safe conduct, together
with directions for their entertainment, but not in the state and sumptuous
manner as before, for in a change of fortune we find a change of friendship
and account, being nevertheless come to Court, they were honorably welcomed,
and comforted after their many endured miseries, where they rested themselves
awhile till the preparations for Rushia were made ready, it being an Army of
forty thousand soldiers. With this new raised power, Demetrius raises new
hopes, both to recover and to revenge, which fell not out according to his
desire, man purposes but God disposes.

Now Vansusce hearing of this great preparation in Poland, fortifies the City
of Mosco, and other places of import, gathering soldiers from all parts to
strengthen his faction, bearing the Muscouite in hand that it was the police of
the Polish King to have entertained some straggling runnagate to take upon him
the name and state of Demetrius, only to countenance this invasion; staying by
this suggestion the uncertain mind of the Muscouite, that otherwise he knew
would be diversely carried. But Demetrius being now in all things furnished for
the trantposing of this great Army into Rushia, takes his leave of the King and
Queen and other of his friends in Poland, but above all, of his dear beloved
Empress, whom his unhappy eyes shall never behold again; to show her sorrow
in his departure, were to stay us in the pursuit of this great war that must
be prosecuted with all speed and cruelty, Demetrius thereforewith many long
marches, at last had past the frontires of the Polish Kingdom, he no sooner had
set footing upon the Territories of his own Empire but the miseries of the war
began, and that Country that before flourished with along countinued peace, and
was grown exceeding rich both in their own abundance, and a prosperous
commerce with others, began now to be spoiled and harried of her plenty; fire
and sword being the executiones: the Pole spoiled and killed in all places in
revenge of the Massacre done in the Mosco, sparing neither sort, nor sex, in
any state or age, whom they met withal, nevertheless the most of them had
before fled into Cities, Castles, Woods and other defensible places.

Thus mischief having set footing in Rushia, it did in a short time take such
rooting, that in a long time after she was not supplanted, Demetrius either
giving consent thereto, or else wanting power in himself to curb her, howbeit
he made as much speed as he could to Mosco, either to make the spoil of his
Country less by his hasty marches, or otherwise burning in desire to be
revenged on that place where he had received such wrong and outrage. Being at
last come to Mosco, he beleagers the City, but finds an unexpected
resistance, it being so strengthened with men and munition that it was
wel-neere vnpregnable, all plaof strength and import about the City were in
short time subdewed and given to the Pole, who executes all manner of cruelty:
Demetrius lays wait in all places to cut off all succor that should be
brought into the City, so that the Muscouite in short time endured great want
and misery, to wright all the particulars of this siege, that continued for the
space of two years, would ask a whole volume by it self; I will only touch
the most special occurrants, according to my best intelligence that happened
in that time.

Vansusce understanding the miseries that the Country people endured by the
cruelty of the Poles, and fearing all great miseries in the City, if the fiege
endured, sent speedily and secretly his Cursitours to Charles King of
Sweathland, whom he knew to be mortal enemy to Sigismond King of Poland,
demanding upon certain conditions his aid to remove the Leagure. King Charles
having at that time an Army of French, English, and Scottish, in pay for any
occasion offered from Sigismond, but understanding at that time all his
preparations were disposed of in Rushia, and knowing also that it the Pole set
footing their he should find him more dangerous there then in his own
Country, yields easily to Vansusces demand, employing the forces of those
strangers which he had strengthened with many companies of Swethens, to the
full number of twelve thousand under the conduct and general command of one
Pontus de la Guard, a French Captain, a man of more fame then worth among them.

CHAP. 9.
Sr. Robert Sherly comes as Ambassador from the Persian to Demetrius in the
Leager, the Muscouite mutiny, but are appeased, Glasco is suspected, convicted,
arraigned, and executed in the Mosco.

KNesevansusee albeit he bare no great affection to King Charles, and was loath
also that so many strangers should be brought into Rushia, to harry and spoil
the Country, yet knowing the difference that was betwixt him and Sigismond King
of Poland, he held it his best to make use thereof, to serve his own turn in
their dissension, and by any means rather to remove the pole, then upon the
best conditions to yield unto their habitation there, making choice rather of
a sufferable than an intolerable stranger. Now while these forces were thus a
raising in Swethland for these designs in Russia, Demetrius with his Army
lying still before the City of Mosco, that brave Spirit of England, Sir Robert
Sherley, came as Ambassador to Demetrius from the Sophie of Persia, demanding
his aid in the general hostility to be made by christian princes against the
common enemy the Turk, where he found that entertainment that those
tumultuous times in warrelike leager could afford, but for the matter of his
Embassy, the present troubles cut off the means of any present aid, so that
after his stay there some few days, having received many honorable gifts and
presents he departed, only furnished with hopes and fair promises, howbeit
his coming thither put the Muscouite into more then a presumption, that it was
the true Demetrius that beleagerd their City, and that the report of his death
was but a fained matter, insomuch that in most places, especially in the Mosco,
they began to murmr, whispering one to an other, that God had forsaken the
guidance of them and their City, and had given them over into the hands of
strangers and others for their disloyalty, they said between themselves, that
it could not be that the King of Poland, other Princes, and many noble men of
Russia in the leager could be so long deceived with a counterfeit Emperor, but
either his countenance, behavior, speech or some ones report or other would
betray him. They compared the times present with the times past, and found that
the Errors and Indiscretions of a young Prince, being their natural Lord, were
more easy to endure than the milder government of an Usurper, for that the
abuse and instabilitie of his estate had drawn infinite dangers and miseries
by a contrary faction, which they now endured in no mean degree, and were like
hereafter to suffer in the greatest extremes these murmurings and privy
whisperings being brought to Vansusces ear, he began to look about, and to
prevent all occasions that might be offered for the raising of a faction within
the City, he therefore sought to pacify the Muscouites in the best manner he
could, and withal sent colourably (under safe conduct) certain Gentlemen his
friends to the Emperor in the Leager, that if he were the right Demetrius his
true and lawful Prince, he should show it in a natural love and care unto his
Country, and not suffer him to be thus defiled with the blood of his people,
by the Poles cruelty, and for his own part, if he found that it were so, he
would not only surrender up unto him, the Title and government that he now
held, together with the City and other places in his command, but also in all
submission acknowledge and serve him in all faithfulness and duty as his
natural liege Lord, he further instructed them to excuse him in the plottes
and courses that he had taken, and to blame but respectively his sufferance in
the abuses of the Poles, that had drawn on the hatred and indignation of the
Muscouite, so far as being gathered to a head, and breaking forth into
action, it proved as a raging Torrent or violent Inundation that no ways
could be stopped: he willed them further to descend into particularities, and
to touch the several factions on his part, that it stood him upon to take the
advantage of his friends offers, and the opportunity of every revolt, to the
end that the head of all, which was himself, might be the surer guarded, and
this (he said) he learned of Nature and Necessity, that teaches every
creature to defend herself, and that albeit he could a long time endure the
siege, and that he knew also the Forces were ready in Swethland to attempt the
Leager, he would yet nevertheless give over these new hopes and designs for
war, and with all his best, endeavor to conclude a peace, protesting with
this conclusion, that if by his majesty's favor he might enjoy those lands,
honors, and offices, to the which partly he was borne, partly he enjoyed by the
deceased Emperors gift, and his own admission, no Prince in the world should
find a more loyal subject or more faithful Gentleman than himself.
Demetrius albeit he suspected a Padde in this straw, did nevertheless either
simply or colourably put them in hope of a Parlee, and for a time held a
cessation, discharging the Messengers with fair words and countenance, who at
their return into the City, gave out that this was not the true Demetrius,
but a counterfeit by Vansusces instructions, and that if they held out but a few
days till the coming of the Swethen Army, the Leager would easily be removed.

Vansusce also bestirres himself to stir up the Muscouite to endure the
siege until the coming of King Charles his forces: In the mean time Demetrius
had understanding secretly of some causes of discontent given from Vansusce to
the traitor Glasco, both in the bars to his expected recompense, and also in
the change of Vansusces favor and countenance, for it is commonly so with
Usurpers, when their turns are served by such Ministers, whohauing made all
the use of them they can, they convert their services done, into injuries,
especially where there is an expectation of reward above merit, for benefits
with tyrants are of no longer pleasure, than they can with ease restore them,
that once transcended, they study not how to reward, but to kill: for Glasco
supposed that his services to Vansusce were of such worth and greatness, that
half the Empire had been scarce his recompense. Demetrius therefore striving
to work upon this his discantent, and that by him some means might be
wrought for the surprise of the City, sent secretly his Lecters unto Glasco,
wherein after he had touched (but in gentle terms) his disloyalty, he willed
him to consider that there was no way for him to recover the love and opinion
both of God and man, but to vntreade again those steppings of treason, which
from a corrupt mind his guilty feet had before trodden, promising him in the
word of a Prince, that if he would find means for him to enter the City, he
would not only pardon what was past, but restore him again into his wonted
place and favor. These Letters being intercepted, were brought to Vansusce,
who presently caused this traitor to be committed to prison, where having a
long time endured much misery, he was at last arraigned and condemned, and
finally, were he faulty, were he faultlesse he was executed in the Mosco, a
fit death for such a life. There were many others of his confederacy, which
because I knew not their names, I would not mention their actions, but this I
deliver from report, that none of them all died their natural death, only one
excepted, that yet lives in a pelting Village in Ruscia, poor, wretched,
miserable and hated of all the world.

CHAP. 10.
King Charles of Swethland sends an army of twelve thousand Soldiers into
Ruscia, under the command of Pontus de la Guard a French Coronell, the Ruscians
join with them and remove the Leager: the Emperor Demetrius flees again
into the Dukedom of Colloge.

NOw must the miseries of Ruscia be augmented by the coming of this Army
compounded of so many Nations, English, French, and Scots. For though they came
as a friend, and for their aid, yet who can stay an Army from spoil and
rapine, which the unhappy Ruscian found true in the pursuit of this bloody
war, not only in their goods and cattelles, but even in their wives and
daughters, which in all places were made a prostituted prey to the lustful
appetite of the Soldiers. It was about the beginning of Summer, that this Army
of King Charles descended into Ruscia, under the command o^ the aforenamed
French Coronell Pontus de la Guard, who with all speed marched with this Army
to the City of Mosco, encamping in the most commodious place they could find
near to the Polish Leager. Demetrius was before advised to remove, by them
who fore-iudged the proof of that which the sequel manifested, foreseeing that
it would be a hard matter for Demetrius to resist both the Forces of the Mosco,
and this new raised power, for being much wearied with a long siege, being now
also with this fresh Army, in a manner beleagerd themselves, they seen found
the want of victualles and other necessaries, which in a short time brought
them to great misery, and to increase the Swethen Army, Demetrius the brother
of Vansusce aduaunceth himself forward with twenty thousand Russians, to
join with the Swethen forces. Now are all places sorestalled that might bring
in succors to the Polish Leager. The Emperor Demetrius was now in greater
misery than ever before: for besides the wants which he endured, the Poales
themselves began to murmr and muteny against him, insomuch as he was often
times enforced to hear many contumelious words and reproaches pronounced
against him, that he was an unhappy Prince, borne to a disastrous fortune, and
not only for himself, but also for such as should take part with him.

The Counsels that were daily held were continually divided, some advise to
make their way through the Swethen Army, others to continue the Leager, the
most to parlee, the last was the worst that Demetrius liked, knowing well that
there would be no composition made without his delivery, either alive or dead
into the hands of Vansusce, which though the Poales knew it was for their best
safety so to do, yet they did abhor it as an execrable deed, to betray a
Prince whom they had undertaken to protect, and to yield him to his enemies
hands whom they had vowed to defend. To continue the Leager, was without all
possibility of effecting, victualles growing so scarce in the Camp, that all
provision was devoured so far as they were enforced to eat their horses; and
from this scarcity followed a great mortallitie. The Poale being so straightly
ingirt, that they wanted ground to bury the dead, the unhappy Prince sits alone
in his tent, all desolate and dismayed, wanting both courage and council in
these extremes; in the Camp he fees his dignity decreased, and his command
not respected; in his Tent he fears murder, in his Cup poison: and though
the causes of these fears were false, there being no such in tendments, yet to
a troubled mind overwhelmed with sorrow, oppressed with care, distracted with
opinion what comfort or conceit can assure, his friends being a few noble men
of Russia that were about him, comfort him and council him, that he would
adventure with those companies of Russians he had yet in his command, which
were faithful to him in all fortunes, being nevertheless not above the number
of a thousand men, make an attempt in the dead of the night for their escape,
even through the Swethen Army, the necessity of the time and place say they
urge you to this dangerous resolution or to die, there being no third way for
you to take: you shall not need to fear our loyalties, because our own lives
lies in the same hazard, and if we line or die, it shall be our glories, that
we have either free^d you from this danger, or that we have communicated our
service to the fortunes of our Prince. For the attempt it self, it may happily
not prove so full of peril as it appears to be, for that the darkness of
the night, the suddenness of the action, and the advantage of the place,
wherein we are quarterd, being but against the skirtes of the Swethen Army,
may happily make our way with more safety, and less loss than you imagine,
howsoever it falls out, the greatest danger dwells here, where to remain,
there is nothing more certain than certain destruction. These words, together
with the desperate condition of their estates, made him suddenly to apprehend
the plot, and to entertain with courage the resolution of this attempt, which
was done so closely and so secretly, as it was not discovered till the larum
was given: this was about the noone of the day, all the after noone was spent
in council, and in giving directions, which also was done so covertly, as the
Poales themselves doubted nothing less than that which was intended. Now is
the hour come wherein Demetrius must pass as great or a greater danger (by
all opinion) than that of the Castle in Mosco, but with less fear or sorrow:
for his unhappy fortunes had now so inured him to such disastrous accidents,
that his mind seemed to be suited to his misery, all things therefore being
ready, they begin to dislodge, the larum was first given in the Swethen
Army, and was so suddenly answered in all places, that it bred a horrible
confusion, the Poales feared a surprise from the Swethen Army, the Swethen from
the Poales. When they came into the Emperors Tent, not finding either his
Guard or himself, they cried out, that he had betrayed them. Pontus de la Guard
draws the best of his Foxes to the head of his Camp, and there attends all
attempts, whilst the Emperor with the loss of a few men had passed the
danger, the darkness of the night being a great help unto him, his guides
before day had brought him out of all fear from any followers, howbeit many of
the Poales followed after, and yielded themselves afterward to him in Colloge.

All this time both the Camps stood still without any attempt on either
side. The City also not knewing the matter were soon in Arms, howbeit kept
themselves within the walls, in the morning the Poales found the plot, and
being driven every way to obey necessity, they required Capitulations of truce
with Vansusce, which was granted, the Articles drawn, the composition made,
the Poles dislodgd, and with colors displayed, they went, some into other parts
of Russia, turning Cossakes, and living upon spoil, some back into Poland,
who having related to their King the manner of Demetrius flight, and by it
their own enforcements, he renounced for ever his friendship and alliance,
protesting from thence forth never to aid him either with men or money. But
though he seemed to be discontent, he was nevertheless inwardly glad that
such occasion was proffered, in his own behalf to revenge and recover the
loss he had sustained, and under this color, together with the broken Title
he had to the Dukedom of Seuean, to invade the whole Empire of Russia, and to
keep it for himself, which shortly after he in person did, as you shall
hear. And thus was the Polish Leager all this time removed.

CHAP. 11.
Kneseuansusce continues still his usurped authority. Sigismond King of Poland
descends into Russia with an army of a hundred thousand men: he beseegeth
Smalensco, and the great City of Mosco. The Emperor Demetrius makes another
attempt, but is driven back into the Dukedom of Collogue.

NOw stood Vansusce higher in state and opinion of the people than ever
before: Now were there daily feastings and triumphs in the City, and all
dedicated to Vansusces fortunes, Orations made daily in the public Hall to
the people of eternal praise and immortal thanks to Vansusces greatness,
even above the strain of slatterie, attributing the safety and preservation
of their lives and goods to his wisdom and providence, together with the
general good of the whole Land, reduced by him from a manifest danger of utter
destruction, the benefit of whose peace (say they) and happy state next under
God, we derive from his Imperial Majesty in his natural and politic body,
the one so absolute in blood and quality, the other so excellent in State and
Council, that as he gives place to no Prince living for Style and Territory,
reaching from the River of Ipre, to the Caspian Sea, in Fame and Glory they
all give place to him; and it is the universal Joy of the whole Empire, that
to a Prince voluptuous and full of defects, as was Demetrius, there has
succeeded a Prince of such high worth and estimation. They also gave great
praises and gifts to the French, English and Scottish for their pains taken,
and valors shown, in their defense, still retayning them in the Mosco for
their garrison. But though the City was for a time thus delivered, and in
quiet, the Poles that remained still in the Country, having taken many
Castles, and strengthened themselves in many places, commit all manner of
unspeakable cruelty and villainy on the poor people, who can call nothing they
have their own, neither wives, children, nor goods, but are all made a
prostituted prey to the Poles lust and rapine; in their houses, sword and fire
destroys them, in the woods, hunger and cold deuouceth them. Thus the poor
Russians in many parts of the country do miserably foele or endure, either
alive or dead, the bondage of the Poles tyranny. Yet these afflictions and
calamities present, are but as a sufferable pain or disease, inflicting one
part or limb, in respect of the universal mischief following, that tormented
and almost destroyed the whole body of the Empire. For by this time Sigismond
King of Poland raises a mighty Army, compounded of many Nations, as Tartars,
Leiflanders, Coerlanders, together with some Companies of English, Scottish and
Dutch, and many numbers of Cossakes, which be people drawn from all parts,
following only for spoil and prey.

Vansusce hearing of these great preparations in Poland, fortifies the Mosco
and other places of import in the Empire, but especially the City of
Smalensco, whereof one KneIacob a Noble man of great power and virtue, was Duke
and Governor, howbeit at that time, for some reasons, he committed the
government and defense of that City to an other whose name I could not
learn. Thus all things being in a readiness, both with the Pole for invasion,
and the Russian for resistance, Sigismond aduaunceth forward with his Army,
consisting of a hundred thousand fighting men. This was about Michael, mass in
the year 1609. for he stayed of purpose till their Harvest was ended for the
relief of his Army. Being descended into Russia, he came with his whole
forces before the City of Smalensco, one Chollcosce a noble soldier that had
done many honorable services against the Turk, being his Lieutenant general.

Now had Vansusce (which I should have remembered before) sent to King Charles
of Swethland for more aid, who presently dispatched his Messengers to France,
England, and the low Countries for men. There were taken up in England of
Voluntaries, English, and Scottish, two thousand under the command of Captain
Calvin a Scottishman, lieutenant Coronel to my Lord of Wormston, and of
Captain Coborne a valiant Soldier Coronell of the horse. There were also sent
at that time out of France, and the low Countries, to the number of one
thousand more, the French under the command of Monsleur la Vile a Captain of
name and worth among them, the Dutch under the command of Coronell Dove: the
English and Scottish Forces arrived in Swethland about the latter end of May,
some in the Nulies, some at Stockholland, and some in other places, as the
uncertainty of wind and weather drove them. But being all at length met at
Stockhollam, entertained, mustered, and sworn unto King Charles, our Forces,
together with the French and Dutch, which by this time were all met, stayed
there the most part of the Summer, until the latter end of August, in which
time the King had made his preparations ready for his Intendments toward
Russia. About the beginning of September these Forces took shipping for
Russia, but by contrary winds were driven upon Fynland, where because the
Commanders had no directions to land their men, the frost ouertaking them, and
victuals failing aboorde, our people unaccustomed to so cold a climate, dyed
in great numbers, for want of food, and abundance of cold, insomuch that
being not able to endure the extremity, they landed their Forces by directions
from the Governor of Abo, a town situate upon the Sea: from thence to march
to the City of Wyborrough, being distant from the place of landing three
score and ten leagues, in which march they lost by the extremity of the
cold, many of their men by the way, and many were left behind sick, that
nevertheless did afterward recover the Army. At the last being come to the
City of Wyborrough in Fynnland, our Troops relieved themselves after this
long weary march, and being kindly entertained of the Bourgers, kept their
Christmasse in the city, and rested there for the space of fourteen days,
wanting no necessaries that their present case required. After this time
expired, our Troops marched three days journey to the Sea side, that Sea
being narrow in that place, parting Fynland and Russia: here they marched
eight leagues upon the Ice, and having once set footing in Russia, the people
of the Country being unacquainted of their coming, forsook their houses,
fleeing into the woods and other unknown places, for the misery of the war
was so great by the outrages of the Soldiers, that they found cause to
distrust all, as well those that came to defend them, as such as came to destroy
them. Yet our troops committed no other spoil in their march, but only in
their provision for victuals, which in all places they found in abundance,
our Troops marched in small iourne is the four months following, January,
February, March and April, under the guide and conduct of one Burrisse a
Noble man of the Country, appointed by Vansusce for that business; in which
march they freeed those parts of the Country, which the Pole before was
possessed of, as the first, a town of import called Stallarusse, which the
Pole forsook upon their coming, and fled. But Monsieur la Vile following
them with a few horse, cut them in pieces. They marched from thence to a Town
of defense called Costasco, which the Pole had a little before beleagerd, but
upon an assault made, having found an unexpected resistance. And hearing the
approach of the strangers, they fled before our coming.

By this time the Sun in his delight some progress having passed the
Equinoctial, had turned the weary wrackes of wastefull winter, into the
cheerful view of the Summers beauty, at which time, it being in the beginning
of May, our Troops recouerd a very pleasant country, where in great plenty
they found all necessaries for horse and man. After some few days march in
this champian country our Troops received intelligence where the Enemy lay,
to the number of seven or eight thousand, at a Town called Arioua some four
score verts, which is three score English miles from them. This Arioua was a
great Town, situate on the side of a hill, pleasant to look upon, the great
river of Vollga running through it, and as it were, equally parting it in the
midst, with a strong and fair Castle in it; howbeit the Town unwalled and
vndefensible.

Our men having received true relation, both concerning the Town, the Poles
strength, the distance, and the best way that leads unto it, they entered
into council, what best was to be done for the surprise of this Town, and a
non slaught of the Poles, and as always in such cases of weight, there are
diversity of Judgments and Opinions, some giving council one way, some
another, the brauest spirits stirred up with honorable emulation of others
fame and greatness, press forward for employment. Coronell Coborne being the
first that desired to have the undertaking of this business with five hundred
horse; but his plot being disliked, as being too full of danger, Monsieur la
Vile the French Coronell undertook with four hundred horse to do some
notable service or other, as occasion should be proffered. For many times in
such doubtful cases, unlooked for Accidents and vnplotted attempts find
better opportunity and success in preuayling upon the sudden, than
premeditated and fore-decreed Counsels. Thus having taken some of every
Troop, English, Scottish, and French, with the aid of three other Captains,
as Captain Cosmorre, a Moore, a very valiant Soldier, brought up in the
wars of the Netherlands, the other Captain Crale an Englishman, and Captain
Creton a Scottishman, with this number of four hundred horse. La Vile early
in the morning leaving the Army in their quarters, marched toward Arioua, by
the way they met with a Conskippe of the Enemy, being a hundred horse upon
the skirt of a wood, if being sent from the maine Army in Arioua as a
scowt-watch to discover our Troops, for they had Intelligence before of our
being in the Country. Their Vancurriers having espied our forces, gave the
larum, and presently turned back and fled, but our Troop followed, flew some,
forced others to take the river of Vollga, took many prisoners, the rest fled,
fyring the Country as they went, and brought the news of our approach to
Arioua. La Vile with his troops held on his course, meeting with no other
Occurrents by the way till he came to a little river, which they found so
deep, and the current running so swift by reason of the late dissoluing of the
Snow, that they knew not how to pass over. La Vile himself proffered to give
the attempt, but was stayed by others that looked into the danger: a French
Soldier of his Troop, showing more courage than foresight, took the river
with his horse, and by the violence of the Stream, were both drowned. Here
they spent some time to seek out a foord, but found none: at last they espied
a narrow place, where (pulling down an old house standing hard by) with the
rafters thereof they made a little bridge, upon which they passed on foot,
swimming over with their horses in their hands. Thus they marched forward till
they came within sight of Arioua about the noone time of the day. La Vile when
he came within view of the Town, and saw how it stood parted by the river of
Vollga, might perceive afar off on the other side of the Town, the Enemies
colors displayed in great numbers, the sodainenesse of the action bred a
terror on both parts, the Poales verily believing that the maine Army of our
Forces to be at hand, and our troops supposing the Enemies strength to be as
great on that side the river as on the other, though vndescried, howbeit they
kept on their march toward the Town, with resolution to do some notable
service, either by death or victory: when they came within half a league of
the Town, they espied five hundred horses of the Enemy advanced against them,
where on the sudden both sides awhile stood in gaze one of an other: at last
forty of the Enemies horses were drawn forth, with proffer of a charge after
the manner of a Brauada, a twelve or sixeteene of our horses gave an onset to
answer them, slew some, and beat the rest back into their maine strength, so
that both parts again stood in gaze one of an other. Some doubted that it was
the policy of the Pole to draw our Forces nearer to the Town, and so to
encompasse them with their Army on the other side of the river.

But La Vile, whose courage overcame all fear, seeing no third way to be
taken, but either that night to die, or to be Masters of the Town, out of a
brave and honorable mind, with a few words in Dutch, did after this manner
encourage his Soldiers, We have come (says he) thus far (my loving friends
and followers) with purpose and resolution to do some special service or
other, in the honor of our Countries, and profession, for aduauncing the
success of the maine action for this Land against the Poles tyranny in the
behalf of the King of Swethen. This place of Command which at this time I
enjoy with your consents, I will strive with all my power to discharge, as well
for your safeties and contentments, as mine own honor and reputation, and
though we be of several Nations, Languages, and Customs, we are in this
business tied together in an indissoluble band of love and partnership, either
to live or die together, the best hope is, we have one God to defend us all,
whose outstretched arm ouer-swayeth all: let not then either our own
weakness, or our Enemies strength affright us, for besides the atchiuements
of Honor that pricketh forward every worthy mind, there is a necessity to
put us forward, for back we cannot go, without certain dishonor and
destruction, all places being harried and spoiled by the Pole, and no relief
to be found: the rivers also and the champian fields will give them advantage
with their numbers to heamme us in, and cut us in pieces: and if I be not
deceived, they stand in more doubt of us, than we of them, as I judge by the
uncertain wauing of their colors on the other side the river, and it may be
all their fear has given them false Intelligence, that we are to receive
seconds from our maine Army, which they suppose to be at hand. From this fear
of theirs springs my hope, that in spite of the Poales Army we shall rest
in yonder Town this night, and with that, crying out with a high voice and
spirit, Ihesus met ounce, which in English is, Jesus be with us, with a brave
courage they advanced forward. Captain Cosmorre with the Englishmen gave the
charge, and was seconded by the French men.

The Pole seeing the charge thus made with such resolution, fearing (as it was
afterward known) the approach of our maine Army, turned their backs, and
fled. Notwithstanding they had a second of four hundred horses more, our
troops followed with all speed, slew many with the sword, the most of them
took the river of Vollga, thinking to recover their maine Army, but the
greatest numbers of them were drowned. Our troops thus entered the town of
Arioua without any other resistance, and found the castle abandoned, at which
they marvelled, that a Town and Castle of such strength and import, having
eight thousand men to defend it, should be thus forsaken.

CHAP. 12.
Vansusce sends his forces to join with the strangers, to the number of thirty
thousand. Pontus de la Guard General of the strangers, attempts to raise the
Poles Leager from Smalensco, but in a set battle is fought withal and
overthrown by the Pole.

ARioua being thus taken in, our Troops rested there three days till our maine
Army came up, in which time the Pole stayed in the Town on the other side the
river. But when they saw the approach of all our forces, they hastened their
departure, and because they supposed the Inhabitants had betrayed them, they
set fire on that side of the Town in the dead of the night, only to revenge
suspicion, where after a most cruel and barbarous manner, they burned and slew,
man, woman, and child; a lamentable sight it was, to behold the flame, and to
hear the confused cries of the people, which was the more miserable, because,
as there was no pity in the Pole to respect them, so there was no way in our
Troops to relieve them, by reason of the river, which for want of boats they
could not pass. The Poles having thus satisfied their rage upon the poor
Russian with blood and fire like incarnate devils, without remorce, leaving
this miserable people of all sorts and sexes, from the impotencie of Age, to
the innocence of Infants, burning in that earths hell of horror, they marched
away with drums beating, trumpets sounding, colors displaying, as if they
had effected some notable atchieuement. Early in the morning, La Vile
perceiving them marching away, having had the night before many boats brought
up the river by the Russe, carried his principal Forces over, and with all
speed followed them. The first night they ouertooke them in their quarters,
slew many of them, took many of their colors, and forced the rest to flee,
who still burning and spoiling the Country as they went, left no relief to
help our Forces in the pursuit, so that in three days, having cleared all
that part of the Country, they returned to Arioua, where our Army rested some
fourteen days: and as contraries are ever best known by their contraries,
they sound the excellency of rest after their labor, and of plenty after
their wants. For here they found all things in abundance that in many places
before they wanted.

Not long after La Vile with Cosmer the Moore, and lieutenant Conisby a very
resolute Soldier, took in a Town called Pogrilla, together with a strong
Skonce manned by the Pole, taking it upon a sur prize in the night putting them
all to the sword only the Gouerneur, and some few other reserved, La Vile,
within a while after, went to the Mosco, accompanied with many Officers,
English, Scottish, and French, where Vanscusce entertained them with liberal
gifts and rewards to every one. Here they met with Pontus de la Guard, and
found a great power of the Russians in a readiness for service. Sigismond
lying all this while before Smalensco, understanding of the free passages, that
the strangers had made through the Country even to the Mosco. And having
received further Intelligence, that their Forces were ready to join with
resolution to attempt to raise the Leager from before Smalensco, sent upon the
sudden Chollcosce his lieutenant general with fifteen thousand Launsiers,
and thirty thousand Cossakes to take a Skance of great import called Gregory,
that lies in the common passage between two great woods from Mosco to
Smalensco. This Skonce being thus strongly beleagered on all sides, Vansusce
raises his Army from the Mosco, constituting his brother Demetrius their
General, who joining with the strangers Forces, of whom Pontus la Guard had the
command, they march toward the Skonce of Gregory, the whole Army consisting
of forty thousand. Being come within two days march of the Skonce, the Enemy
having gotten intelligence by some of our fugitives, of the approach of this
Army, their numbers and purposes, which was to surprise them in the night
upon a nonslaught. Cholcosce to prevent their project the night before, draws
out of his Leager three thousand and five hundred Launsiers, being Noble men
and Gentle men of the best rank and resolution, that came with the King out
of Poland, together with seven thousand Cossakes, and with this number, having
nine thousand Launsiers more for a second, closely in the night they marched;
and early in the morning, which was Midsummer day, they fell suddenly upon
our quarters. Our men trusting that the Muscouite, who knew the Country, would
by the Scowt-watches have given the larum of any sudden approach. But the
Russe not daring to stir out of their quarters, was the cause of our unhappy
defeature, and their own utter overthrow, for our men being thus put into
amazement by the larum given. Pontus de la Guard did according to the shortness
of the time, and the weight of the danger) dispose in this manner of his
Forces, the vangard he gave to Edward Horn a full Soldier and a brave
Commander with his Regiment of Fynlanders, who were the first that stood the
Poles charge. But being ouercharged by the Poles number of Launsters, they
fled, scarce abiding the charge. Coronell Coborne commanding the English
horse, advanced forward with his Troops, to answer the Pole. The French and
Dutch did the like. But Cholcosce finding them weakly armd and horsed, being
also encouraged before with the overthrow of the Fynlanders, with courage and
resolution followed the tract of his fortune; and in short time overthrew the
whole Forces of the strangers horse, but with the death of many of his own
Launsiers, The whole Army of the Russe seeing the fortune of our forces, being
themselves out of danger, fled, without stroke striking. The companies of our
foot, seeing the success of the day, did barrocad^ themselves with Carts and
Wagons, with resolution to fight it out to the last man, or to take some
honorable composition. Which Cholcosce perceiving, and doubting some further
stratagem, his return also back to the Skonce of Gregory being of moment,
satisfying himself at that time with the glory of this day, made a tender of
these proffers following, that if they would give over their strength, they
should be at liberty, either to serve the Emperor, or the King of Pole with
the same pay they had: if they would return to the King of Swethland; they
should have leave, if into their own Countries, they should have license, and
help to pass through the Poles Country, with the Kings favor. These proffers
were accepted, and they having yielded, did severally dispose of themselves,
some back to the Emperor, some to the King of Swethen, the most of them to
the Pole, many home into their Countries. Thus was this great Army unhappily
disperced, that never met together again. Pontus de la Guard, Edward Horn, La
Vile, Collayne, and Coborne, with a few Officers, and some Soldiers, to the
number of five hundred, returned back to the King of Swethen.

CHAP. 13.
The Emperor Demetrius returns from Colloge with a hundred thousand men and
beleagers Mosco on the one side of the town, Cholcosce on the other. Vansusce
is taken prisoner, and sent into Poland. Demetrius flees again to Colloge, and
is at last miserably slain by a Tartare.

VAnsusce hearing of the overthrow of his Army, was much troubled in his mind,
especially for the defeature of the strangers, upon whom he principally
trusted: he now saw, that the hand of God was against him in dangers
inevitable, which by humane reason and judgment, he could not avoid, he
feared Demetrius on the one side, that had drawn together in Colloge a hundred
thousand men, with purpose to besiege the Mosco on the other side. He knew the
Poales forces before Smalensco, and that they were still re-informed with new
supplies: he feared Gregory could not hold out that Skonce, bearing his name
which Cholcosce had beleagerd, but that he would yield it up upon any
composition, as indeed he did. He knew then that there was no bar nor hawlt
for the Poales Army to march from Smalensco, to the City of Mosco. To the
increase of these fears he saw the city empty of victualles, and other
provision for the wars. But that which most troubled him, he found his
reputation much lessened in the opinion of the Muscouite. While Vansusce stood
thus exercised and perplexed with these fears, sailing betwixt Scilla and
Charibdis, in doubt which way to take the Emperor Demetrius, lays hold of the
occasion, and once more attempts with this new raised power to recover his
Empire, he therefore with all speed aduanceth forward with this great Army,
consisting of a hundred thousand men, that in those tumultuous times, either
for his love, or their own safeties had fled unto him, there were also ten
thousand Poles in his Army that had followed him in his last flight from the
Mosco. He having thus once more like an Emperor the commanding of such an
Army, which nevertheless was more fearful for their numbers then in their
arms and courage, came before the City, fortifying his camp, and planting his
Ordonance, which soon began to batter. Sigismond King of Poland having
intelligence hereof takes his advantage in this division and sends Cholcosce
his lieutenant general, having lately taken in the fort of Gregory with forty
thousand men to beleager the other side of Mosco, there were also fifteen
hundred strangers in his army, English, Scottish, and French, that had put
themselves into the King of Poles service after their defeature on
Midsummerday. Now was this great city environed on all sides, with huge
numbers of men of war, and in short time brought to so great misery in the
height of all extreme, that if a man could imagine in such a case the worst of
calamity, such was the wretched fortune of this city, wherein nothing but
horror and despair was found, the canon roaring without, women and children
crying within, the noise of drums, trumpets, horses, harqnebuses, and the
helpless groans of dying men, made it on earth a hell to the miserable
Muscouite. Famine also at length so pincht them that they found these
mischiefs to be insufferable. Now was Vansusce without heart or hope, fearing
daily to be betrayed by his own friends, if we may call it treason, to betray
a traitor, and his fears proved true, for many noble men that were about him,
looking into the present times condition, and reducing to their minds the
nature of the times past, they found Vansusce to be both the original and
efficient cause of all these miseries, and that God had thus plagued them with
the plagues of men, for suffering an usurper to reign over them, so that at
last upon advice taken, they took Vansusce prisoner sitting in council among
them, with suppose, by delivering him captive, to make their peace with
Cholcosce, O had the unkind and unstable Muscouite delivered this usurper unto
their lawful Emperor Demetrius that lay on the other side the city, and had
brought him in with their submission and acknowledgement of alegeance, they
might have had the hand of God to have fought for them, and happily in short time
recovered their former peace and glory. But they doubting his weakness, and
fearing the strength of the Poles, delivered up their prisoner, together with
the City into the power of Cholcosce, to be kept for the king of Pole. Which
in this manner was effected.

It was agreed upon between Cholcosce and the State of Russia, that he should
have delivered into his hands, the City and the Castle to be held with a
garrison for Sigismond King of Poland, unto whom they proffered acknowledgement
of homage and fraltie, conditionally, that Cholcosce with his Army should
presently remove the Leager of the Emperor Demetrius on the other side the
river. These proffers were accepted of Cholcosce, together with the condition,
conditionally that they should deliver sufficient hostages into his hands sor
the safeguard of himself and his Army, which was granted, and a many of the
Nobility chosen out as the great Patriarch of Mosco. KoeIacob Duke of
Smalensco, and others of great power, who being delivered to the Cholcosce,
sent them all as pledges to the King of Pole. Thus Cholcosce having taken
possession of the City mariheth through to fight with Demetrius, and in short
time overthrew him, who fleeing again to Colloge, found himself there also
abandoued of all his friends. Thus this unhappy Prince, fleeing from place to
place, finding no place for safety, was afterward (as I have heard it
reported) miserably slain by a Tartar.

Thus Cholcosce returning back to the City in triumphant manner, was solemnly
entertained of the Muscouite, who presented him also with many great gifts. He
having stayed a while in the City, and planted a garrison of eight thousand
Poles in the Castle, returned to Smalensco with his prisoner Vansusce and
delivered him to his master the King of Pole, who not long after sent him into
Poland, to be kept prisoner at the Castle of Waringborrough, where he yet lives
a miserable captine.

Sigismond the year following takes in Smalensco upon assault, and returns
into Poland, disposing the most part of his Army into garrisons in Russia. But
the Muscouite in short time after rebelled, and having drawn the Tartare as
their Assistants, after a long and bloody assault, they at the last recovered
the City and Castle of Mosco, putting all the Poles to the sword. Thus was
the Colloge again freed, but not secured from the tyranny of the Poales, who
are still possessors of a great part of that Country, sometimes losing in one
place, oftentimes gaining in an other, never resting, but still in action,
which the wretched people do miserably sustain. And thus (as I understand)
stands the condition of this torn Empire of Russia at this day.

FINIS.
