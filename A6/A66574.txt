TO HIS EXCELLENCE RICHARD Earl of ARRAN etc. LORD DEPUTY of IRELAND,

A POEM.

-- Nec deficit alter
Aureus, and simili frondescit virga metallo.
DVBLIN, Printed at His Majesty's Printing House for Joseph Wild Bookseller in
Castle-Street. 1682.

To His Excellence Richard Earl of Arran, Lord Deputy of Ireland: On the
occasion of His Grace James Duke of Ormonde etc. Lord Lieutenant of the same,
(His father 's) going for England, And leaving the Government to him.
HEnce the nice Wits that are so squeamish grown,
Nothing will down with them, but what 's their own:
It has been said (yet taxed) I freeze, and burn,
And the same instant, both rejoice, and mourn
And why (I pray) may not different notes agree?
Take away discords, where is the Harmony?
Both are met here: We mourn, one Sun gone East,
And joy, Another rising in the West:
Such -- such, as had the Ancient Persian
Viewed the Parelia, this double Sun
Had made him stagger at the smart surprise,
Nor yet resolved, divide his sacrifice.
It Is now past twenty times since the Ormonde stem
First brancht it self in such a Princely Beam;
And may it yet increase; and multiply
It Is scattered rays, into a Galaxy.
Spread-Eagles join in body; Lucifer,
And Vesper, are the same alternate Star:
The Elements, Castor and Pollux too,
Relieve each other, and in that, still new.
Nature had never made a second day,
Without a nights repose; that short allay,
Stamped us another, and that timely care
Stepped in, and saved the Infant-World's despair.
And now, it is but a day from Sun, to Sun;
The one takes up, the other, holds it on:
Seasons, to Seasons give a fresh supply;
The year absolved, comes the Epiphany.
Such Your most noble Father ( Sir's) with you;
He closes one, and you, begin the new:
And, be his Motions, yours, I Will boldly say,
The Sun withdrew, and yet We lost no day.
J. Wilson.
