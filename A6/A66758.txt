MEDITATIONS UPON The Lords Prayer: WITH A PREPARATORY PREAMBLE, To the Right
Understanding, and True Use of this PATTERN.

Contemplated by the Author, during the time, wherein his House was visited by
the Pestilence 1665. and is dedicated to them, by whose Charity, God preserved
him and his Family, from perishing in their late troubles.

That, which we have, we are obliged to give,
In recompense, of that which we receive,
And, with some, this will relish, though it be
Fruit gathered from an aged Withered Tree.
Many particulars, pertinent to these last times, are hereby offered to
consideration, by the said Author, Geo. Withe^*

Legite, and perlegite.
Read all, lest wrong, by prejudice ensue,
Either unto this Author, or to you:
For, since all cannot be expressed together,
One place must often help expound another.
LONDON, Printed in the Year 1665.

To the Authors Christians, Friends (by whose Charity, GOD, has hitherto
preserved him in manifold troubles and sufferings) Grace and Peace in our Lord
Jesus Christ.
THe repute of a POET, which I have had among some, has caused many Pious
well-meaning persons to suspect that Meditations upon a Subject of this Nature,
are neither proper to me, nor like to produce any considerable Esteem or
Effect: yet, I have better hopes; for, Poesy is a good Gift, vouchsafed for a
pr^paratory to Prophecy, and often has been improved to the honor of God, by
those who abused it not to serve the World, the F^^sh, and the Devil. In some
degrees, it has also been so sanctified unto me, by Gods Grace, that many who
had a sinister Opinion of that Faculty, have acknowledged themselves profited
th^reby, in Duti^s relating both to GOD and Man; which makes me hop^ful, these
Musings will not be Fruitless.

I have rcceived seasonable Refreshments, from many of you, whose Persons or
Names, I yet know not, nor am likely to know whilst I live; therefore, I must
commit your Reward to him who knows you, and will remember your kindnesses,
when we have quite forgotten each other. I know, that you who are living,
expect nothing from me toward a Recompense; and the greatest number of my known
Friends in this City, have their Reward already; for, I believe they are with
God. Yet, to discharge my Conscience (that the like Charity may not seem cast
away upon those, who may as much need it, and better deserve it) I endeavored
to leave behind me a grateful Testimony, which might be some evidence, that, I
consumed not the remainder of my life (preserved by your Mercy) either in
idleness, or in living wholly to my self; and among other suchlike
endeavourings (partly published, and partly reserved in private hands) composed
the ensuing Meditations, during my solitariness in the late Pestilence, as
also, that I might have been found well-doing, if God should have then called
me.

This, being finished by his Gracious assistance, I now offer it up for a
Thank-oblation to him; and bequeath it also, as a token of my gratitude to you,
who are yet living, hoping it will be acceptable to both, being the Fruit of
his Mercy and yours, without more of mine, then the putting that into words,
which God put into my heart, when I had no Book but his; nor so much in memory,
w^itten by any humane Author upon this Subject, as may be comprehended in one
line; and, being carried upon the wings of my single Contemplation to various
Objects, like an Eagle flying every way to seek food for her self and her
Eaglets; you will here find some things perhaps, which will be offensive to
weak stomachs: But, I know it is wholesome, and am confident that if it be
tasted without prejudice, it will at last, be pleasing to their Appetites, who
at first disgust it. However, I have well intended it, and Gods will be done.

We may in Judgment differ in some Cases
As innocently, as we do in Faces:
But, in our Failings, if preserve we shall
The Bond of Love, it makes amends for all.
Until, therefore, convinced by Truth Divine,
Enjoy your Conscience, and leave me to mine.
He, that so does not, though he Truth profess,
Shall else, retain it in unrighteousness,
And, he, whom Loving Caution, does offend,
Will, that while, be nor mine, nor his own Friend.
Savoy, December. 30. 1665. I am, your Faithful and humble Servant, GEO. WITHER.

THE PREAMBLE.
IF all that which is comprehended, and may be pertinently apprehended, by
every Contemplative Soul, seriously meditating the Words and Actions of our
blessed Redeemer whilst he continued upon earth, it would unquestionly be
believed, that St. John the Evangelist, did not Hyperbolize, when in the verse
concluding his Gospel, he affirmed, that, besides what he had therein
expressed, Jeses did many other things, which if they should be all written, he
supposed that even the world it self, could not contain the Books that should
be written. Therefore, it cannot be justly expected, that all which is
contained in that brief Form of Prayer recommended to his Disciples then
living, can possibly be made forth explicitly in every Essential and
Circumstantial pertinency thereof, by the single Faculty of any one
contemplative Believer, how large soever his Intellectual Capacity may be: much
less can it be expected from me, who, by what I have endeavored to raise up my
Soul thereby to entertain the true Spirit of Prayer, can reach to but a part of
those Notions, which may be extracted from that Body of Devotion, whereby the
powerful and true performance of our duty in Prayer is evidenced and preserved:
yet for as much as it has been much stifled in this last Generation, by mere
Formalites, and by multiplying such vain words as our Savior terms Babbling;
and in regard, some also (in other respects good and Pious men) have totally
neglected that wholesome Form of Words; and othersome superstitiously repeated
them for fashionsake only, without any sense of what is thereby petitioned
for, either toward the advance of Gods Glory, or of their own well-being; I
have added my Mite, to rectify that which I think ought to be reformed.

2. It cannot be denied, but that many have made an Idolatrous and
superstitious use of Gods written Word, and particularly of this superlative
Form of Prayer, as if the bare repetition thereof (even in an unknown Tongue)
were a Charm effectual to such ends as they fancy, though they neither
understand the meaning of the Words, nor (if they do) endeavor so to conform
their devotion and affections thereto, that it may be made acceptable according
to his intention who prescribed it: For, he gave it to be used either
literally, or in the sense of his Original words indifferently, as also to be a
standing Pattern, whereby all verbal and mental Prayers should be regulated,
lest we sometimes blaspheam God, or curse our selves instead of praying for
Blessings; or, lest we err by that vain babbling, which our Savior reprehended
in the hypocritical Scribes and Pharisees. Christ Jesus very well knew, both by
his Divine Wisdom, and experimentally, by assuming our humane Nature, all our
defects and infirmities, and therefore graciously provided this Expedient for
preventing such errors; and, the whole Catholic Church has found just Cause
to praise him for that Condescension, being one special means to preserve the
principal Worship of God, from being totally adulterated, or else quite buried,
under the rubbish of humane Inventions; as it was when Heathenish Idolatries
first crept in; and as now it is, where the mystery of Iniquity, is almost at
highest: For, though the spirituality and true life of Religion and Divine
Worship, consists not altogether in outward Formalities, yet, unless it has
some bodily existence, and external Clothing whereby it may be made
perceptible, and apprehensive, in some degree, by our humane Faculties, it
could neither be known, or long retained; though there may be some intellectual
glimmerings thereof in such as are supernaturally illuminated: much less could
it be communicated from man to man, by those corporeal Organs, which are the
Mediums whereby the affections and inclinations of our souls are made known to
our selves and other men; upon which considerations, I am persuaded that they
who totally neglect, and they who superstitiously affect his Form of Prayer,
are equally reproveable.

I acknowledge there is in many, an excellent gift of extempore vocal Prayer,
pertinent to the stirring up of Devotion and Pious Affections in themselves and
other men; and with much reverence I comply therewithal and assent thereto when
I am admitted to partake in their Devotions; yea, and without envying Gods
dispensations to them, by whom I see my self to be far excelled: For, he who
dispenses his Gifts as he pleases, made Aaron, who was inferior to Moses in
other Graces, superior to him in vocal expressions. I ingenuously confess my
self also to be sometimes ashamed to be silent where such duties are performed;
but, my natural modesty, and my want of memory (or somewhat worse) renders me
fearful to speak before an Assembly. Perhaps, my secret pride tempts me to
preserve by silence a better opinion in others of my ability in that kind,
then I have; But, whatsoever occasions it in me, I suspect that better men then
I are otherwhile liable to the same temptation through the same defect, and may
have need of premeditated words. To say the whole Truth, my verbal Devotions
are frequently so broken into dis-joynted parts, and so dissatisfactory to my
self, that I cannot hope they will be plausible to my hearers, unless I had
time to put them into better order; which when I have done in the best mode I
can, I think defective, until I have perfited my Devotions with that Prayer,
whereupon I have grounded my ensuing Meditations; and am persuaded, that Form
is not always added superstitiously to other Prayers; and that their Devotions
are acceptable, who in sincerity, and with a true desire to express their
necessities, or thankfulness to God, offer up unto him their prayers or praises
in words wanting Grammatical coherence, and in such Language as they are able:
For, if we are pleased to hear our little Children stammer out their wants and
affections, in such imperfect terms as they are capable of, though it be
nonsense; much more does our Heavenly Father, who better knows our Infirmities
(and requires no more of any man then he has given him) take delight in their
good endeavors, who prosecute them as they are able, though in much childish
weakness; which appears by his Sons care taken to prevent the despising and
offending of such, by their stronger brethren. He knew also, that the most
perfect could not attain to that perfection without means of improvement, and
therefore left them this Form of Prayer; which, if right use be thereof made,
may be to the wisest of them, great advantages many ways.

4. I know well, that not a few, who seem to have acquired most perfections,
and to be better qualified for performance of such Duties then many of their
brethren, are otherwhile fain to use set Forms of Prayer composed by their
National Churches, or by particular pious men; and I suppose it to be a great
weakness in them, who for no other respect, are offended thereat, or with such
as therein join: For, if it be allowable to join in a vocal extempore Prayer,
with him, the scope of whose Petitions we cannot know until we hear them, (and
whose Prayers are at that time, a set Form to his Auditory, if not to him who
speaks them) doubtless we may with less scruple pray with another, whose words
we know beforehand, and wherein we find nothing repugnant to this Pattern left
us by our Savior. In such Prayers or Praises, whether public on private,
Extempore or set Forms, I can join with any person or Congretion professing,
Faith in Jesus Christ; so they be not wittingly, willingly, maliciously, and
impenitently, scandalous in Doctrine or manners; though there may be some
deficiency or superfluity in Words or Forms; and in such conrformities, I
demean my self without giving cause of disturbance to their Devotions with whom
I communicate; yea, and without uncharitably censuing them in my heart, as to
that which is contrary to my Judgment. For, I know the best men, and the best
humane Forms, have their defects, and that their duties and divine Mysteries
are known to them but in part. Therefore when in their Preachings or Divine
Worshippings, I hear and heed ought which to my understanding, is not Orthodox
or comely; or expressions insisted upon, or attributes given to persons, or
things, of whose truth I am not certain; then, instead of absolute compliance
therein, I waving that, lift up my heart in secret to God, beseeching him to
pardon what is misdone or missaid, by others, or misunderstood by me, if I have
misapprehended their pious meanings.

5. The Forms of Prayer and Praises dictated by the Holy Ghost, and recorded in
the Psalms, or other Books of Holy Scripture, I can use without scruple in the
same words, either in the Original, or in any other Language that I undersand,
as occasions require: but, not without premeditating the distinct Mysteries in
them contained, whereby I may be conscientiously satisfied, what particular
Mystery, is touched in the whole and in every particle, lest (as I said before)
I may sometimes blaspheam or curse instead of praying, by misapplying that to
one, which is properly appliable to another: And those Maledictions to my own
Enemies, which are intended only to the Adversaries of Christ: or, left I take
those Attributes to my self in my single Capacity, which are properly due to
none but to Jesus Christ, and to me and others, no otherwise, then as we are
Members of his Mystical Body. This is not so much heeded by some as it ought to
be, who make frequent use of David's Psalms at adventure, in their public and
private Devotions. With much precaution therefore, I endeavor as I am able, to
pray and praise GOD, in those words of his own* which I find recorded in the
Old Testament, with respect to what was Legally, and to what was evangelically
to be considered; knowing it required much heed to avoid such mistakes as we
might else incur, by a negligent use of them. But this Form of Prayer, which I
have now meditated upon, is made so plain and so suitable to the whole, and to
every individual Member of Christ's Mystical Body, as also to the meanest
capacities, that it may safely be repeated singly and jointly in the literal
sense. Yet I have observed, (and I think am not therein deceived) that, God
has permitted many wiser men then I am, to be subject to misapprehensions, in
the duties of Praise and Prayer, and particularly, in the use of this
unquestionable Form; and perhaps has so permitted it, thereby to prove and
exercise their Humility, Patience, Prudence and Love; which being well
considered, together with that Christian Liberty, which ought to be preserved
without Infringement (and from over-far enlarging the limits thereof) would
qualify the Contest among dissenting Brethren, and therefore I have here, to
that end, precautioned so much as I conceive may be pertinently extracted from
the subject I have now in hand; and it gives me occasion of many particular
hints to that purpose; For,

This is a Charm, made by the best Physician,
Which (if applied without superstition)
Cures and secures; It Is a Catholicon,
Compounded for the use of every one:
In weal and woe, in every differing Case;
For every Change, in every Time and Place;
For each State, Person, Sex, Age, and Degree,
Whether mean, high, low, rich or poor they be,
Single or Congregated, if, they pray it
Hallowed with Faith and Love, as well as say it:
For said in words it may be, yet not prayed,
And, prayed it may be, though in words, not said:
Who ever, therefore, shall not be partaker
Of profit by it, cannot blame the Maker.
6 Some, overstrictly, confine other men, within their jurisdiction, to their
set Forms of Prayers and Worships, upon such penalties is are unmercifully
destructive to the peace, estates, relations and persons of those who are by
them compelled; because, their tender unsatisfied Consciences will not permit
that compliance which is required, lest they should thereby violate that
obedience which they believe is owing to a Superior Power, and to him who is
the sole Judge in all Causes relating to his own Supremacy: And, if that be
unfeignedly their Plea, without respect to any carnal self ends, and no
unquestionable Evidence produced, proving that their Principles or practices
tend to the violation of the Moral Law, or to the breach of the Common Peace,
by their default, it seems very hard measure to compel them, contrary to the
Law of Nature, or the ancient Privileges of their Nation, actively to submit
unto that which is offensive to their Consciences in respect of God, and
repugnant to that Light which is in them; especially, when they are questioned
upon bare suspicions, or by the clandestine Informations of persons having no
good report; as also, before they shall be convinced of erring, by better
Arguments then compulsion, and the arbitrary will and pleasure of those, who
are neither authorized to judge of matters relating to God alone; nor have
means to take true cagnizance of such secrets as cannot certainly be known to
any but to God himself. The consequents of such inforcements are not only
destructive to their persons and Families, who are compelled if they submit
not; or, hazzardous to their souls who submit contrary to what they believe in
their hearts; because, they become thereby guilty, of that which is abhorred of
God (to whom also, that is unpleasing which is unwillingly performed, though it
be what he himself commands;) but, it is also mischievous, or at least
unprofitable to the Imposers, as will be made probable in what follows. To the
clean all things are clean, and that which defiles one will not defile another,
if conscienciously acted without any mere carnal and self-end. St. Paul said
(Romans 14 14.) he was persuaded by Christ Jesus, That there is nothing unclean
in it self; yet, to him who believes any thing to be unclean, to him it is
unclean; And, in that respect, we are exhorted in the same Chapter, to follow
those things which tend to peace, and whereby we may edify one another,
without giving just cause of offense to our weak Brethren; or, of blaspheaming,
to them who are without; or, of infringing the Christian Liberty, which
permits the profession, practice or omission of things indifferent, so far
forth as they are honest, just, of good report among good men, and tending to
edification in the love and fear of God, And it is very considerable, that the
enforcing such things, one way or another, produces one of the most
mischievous consequences in the world, both to those who compel them, and to
them among whom they live: for, when they have constrained men by hope or fear
of temporary advantages or disadvantages, to destroy their Consciences (which
makes them men of no Consciences, and thereby such as have also no God) they do
by that imprudence, add none to their own Party, but such wicked Hypocrites,
and secret Traitors, as otherwhile become a Plague both to those who offered
violence to their pretended consciences; and to all other good men with whom
they have to do: for, whatsoever Oaths they take, whatsoever Covenants they
make, whatsoever Engagements they enter into, they usually become false and
perfidious to those who trusted them, as soon as they find it may be to their
particular advantage; And I have long observed, that those Formalities in
Divine Worship, which are submitted unto through fear, and even those
principles of Truth which are professed for carnal ends only, did never make
any such to be the better men; and I therefore wonder what they hope to get by
it, who by compulsion make proselytes or Conformists to their Judgment and
Practice, those who are neither truly serviceable to God, to their Country, or
to whom they are compelled; except it be for this end, that when such Imposers
have services to be done, which none but the most damnable Villanes will do,
they may know where to find them.

7. I am no accepter of Persons or Parties, further then I find them qualified
according to the Principles of Love and Truth: therefore, execuse me, though I
am bold to say, there are some other so unreasonably adverse to all Forms,
Ceremonies and Customs, how expedient soever to prevent disorder and cure
Ignorance, (although not evil in themselves) that they can hardly be prevailed
upon by any Arguments to conform unto them in their own persons, or to allow
them to others whose consciences incline them thereunto; though they cannot
make forth, how without some of them, they and other men could have so easily
been made acquainted with the soul and spiritual existence of Religion, had
they wanted a bodily form whereby it might be rendered apprehensive. These
Oppugners of all Formalities in Divine Worship, which are not in positive terms
commanded (though not countermanded in the written Word of God) do not well
heed that the Primitive Church, and even they themselves admit some such to be
necessary, or at least expedient; as, admitting women to participate in the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper, with many more. Nor observe they, that the Holy
Ghost, has permitted the Church of Christ to tolerate the Observation of such
Ceremonies for a time, as might tend to prevent Persecution, advance Piety, or
else to the preservation of civil Peace and humane Society, though not
warranted in express terms. And that Liberty seems approveable by the
practice of the Primitive Church, when the necessities of times, places, or the
constitutions of the people did rationally require it; and when no more was
imposed on weak Believers, then they had strength to bear; such things as were
then seasonable being enjoined or permitted, but at some times, in some places,
and upon emergent occasions, to be so long only, and no longer continued; and
no other force used but loving compellations, by reasonable Arguments; and no
wrong is done to them upon whom such force irresistably prevails: Nor are such
things justly reputed burdensome, which necessity requires (though they have
accidentally some evil Consequence) when they evidently prevent greater evils.
Such was the circumcising of Timothy, the observing of the Jewish Sabbath, the
forbearance of things strangled, or offered to Idols, or eating, or not eating
of meats, with other such, whereof some were longer, and some less while
continued, laid aside, and reasumed by particular Churches; and rejected again
as occasion required without Schism. This Sobriety and Christian prudence,
being now imitated, would renew tbat Peace and brotherly Concord, which is
almost Universally destroyed by a barbarous violence, or imprudent Zeal, to the
hazzad of all true Piety and Morality, through their intemperancy, who more
desire to accomplish their own self-will, then the Will of God: For the most
part of dissenting Parties are equally superstitious and injurious, both to
themselves and others in things which they oppugn or reprove, when their use
or not using them is magisterially required or denied; especially, when such
things, as are expedient, and at some other times not so, are at all times
obstinately insisted upon, as those were by some of Old, which are called
Beggarly Rudiments; the forbidding whereof when they were needful, and the
enforcing their continuance when needless, is as absurd a practice, as to take
from those who would learn to read, the liberty of naming the letters, and
spelling them syllable after syllable, to make up the words; and to enjoin all
those who can read perfectly, to do the same; yet (though it be not heeded by
all) the like absurdity may be observed in what relates to the duty and gift of
Prayer and Thanksgivings; and that many wise and good men (as I think) in other
respects, have erred both in judgment and practice, by inclining overmuch to
the Left Hand, or to the Right.

8. I acknowledge it is an excellent gift to be able to pray and speak
publicly, without premeditation upon all occasions, with a sober confidence,
in words pertinent to the matter in hand, and to the necessities of those to
whom we speak, or for whom we pray; so it be done with a sincere heart, and a
true sense of that for which we are petitioners; as also, with a reverend
regard to the Majesty of God: But all have not this gift, who have that opinion
of themselves; for, this Faculty may be only a branch of the gift of Prayer in
the vocal part thereof, and may be so well counterfeited, that none but God
himself, can discern the frothiness of it: for, he that has a strong retentive
Memory, a voluble Tongue, and but an ordinary natural Wit, may by long
endeavoring to get his Livelihood, or catch Opinion thereby, (plausibly and
without hesitation) act over that, which he has often read or heard spoken by
other men; and so well personate the same, that it may seem to proceed from an
extraordinary gift of the Holy Ghost; yet, be nothing so; and his many good
words flow from carnal affections, inclining him to seek the accomplishing of
some pleasing self-end, by the practice thereof; and his performances amount to
no more then the Actors of Interludes attain unto in other Countries, where
their Comedies and Tragedies, are not penned for them to their hands, as with
us: for, the Actors having first designed a Plot among themselves, speak
extemporarily, by the strength of their natural Wit, according to their general
Design, as occasions are mutually given; and otherwhile, he that has most
Ignorance, if he has also impudence and confidence enough, wins most applause,
because the greatest number of the Auditory being more ignorant then he,
perceive not the absurdities committed in a quick and sudden delivery; and so
perhaps it frequently happens among speakers and hearers of extempore Prayers

9. The true Gift of Prayer, though it is also powerful in words, consists
not wholly in vocal expressions, but principally in such a frame of Spirit, as
enables us according as the Apostle exhoreth, to Pray continually, not thereby
intending we should be always speaking or bearing, to the neglect of other
necessary duties, but that we should as much as possibly keep our hearts always
in such a temper (by retaining implicitly what is at sometimes to be
explicitly uttered) that, such ejaculations, and upliftings of the heart as
are pertinent to Prayer and Thanksgivings, may be at all times in readiness to
be vocally or internally applied upon every occasion offered. And set Forms of
Prayer, used in National Churches, or particular Congregations, or private
Families, are not to be despised as if no effects of the Spirit: for, so far
forth as they are without intermixture of mere humane Inventions, or
superstitious additions, they are outflowings from the Spirit of Prayer, and
often helpful to teach the ignorant how to pray in secret; there being very
many who had no other visible means of Instruction, who nevertheless, by Gods
blessing thereupon, have been thereby enabled both to pray as they ought to do,
and also to instruct others. Moreover, somewhat pertinent to that duty is
otherwhile thereby brought to their remembrances, who had been else in a total
ignorance of that Duty; and it may be brings likewise advantages to them who
are most knowing; yea to many who now think those Forms altogether needless.
Doubtless therefore, those Forms are still profitable to some, and might be so
to more, if they were not so wilfully imposed and opposed as they are, to the
violation of the Christian Liberty, and Charity on both sides. For, if all men
could believe, at they rationally may, that the Spirit of God is concurrently
assisting to many who pray without premeditation in extempore words, they might
as reasonably believe, that the Prayers composed in a time of Reformation, by
those pious men, who in many sufferings (even to the loss of their lives)
testified their sincerity, are still assisted and accompanied by the same
Spirit, which first dictated them in such words, as might neither be
unacceptable to God, nor an offensive stumbling block to the weak Converts of
those times wherein they were composed. And, if this be granted, Why should we
not likewise think, that all those Forms of Prayer, and Praise whatsoever,
which were at any time Originally inspired by the Spirit of God, (whether
suddenly or by premeditation) will always be effectual for them, who shall pray
in the same Form, with the same integrity of heart, and with the same
intentions, when the necessities or occasions are the same? especially when
upon well weighing the words, they shall and may, if need be, tacitly or
explicitly wave such of them (or their commonly received sense) as the
mutability of events, or the practice of the times (or their misunderstanding
of them) has made offensive to them, or the consciences of their weak
Brethren, to whom offense may be thereby given? For, this is no more then we do
(if we do as we should) when we pray in the words of David's Psalms, the literal
sense whereof may be in some places retained, and must be waved in some other,
lest we pervert the meaning of the Holy Ghost.

10. In thus using our Christian Liberty and Prudence, if we become offensive
to any against our wills, it is an offense rather taken then given; yea, such
an offense as will of necessity be, and cannot be totally avoided, whether we
join with others in their Forms of Prayer and Praise, or absent our selves from
them; because, whether we communicate or not, we shall offend some weak
Brethren, on one hand or the other, unless we will exclude all from being our
Brethren in Christ, who are not altogether one with us in our judgment and
practice in each circumstance; which I shall never do, in regard, in such
things at we differ upon, it fares with us, as with such as paint the
similitude of a City or Castle, which may much differ in the portraicture, yet
each several resemblance be true; because, the several stations, in which the
Artists take view of the place will occasion a great dissimilitude of that
which is represented. We therefore, in such things as I now treat of, can by no
means be preserved blameless or excused, but by taking heed that we sin not
against our own Consciences or knowledge in what we do, nor judge uncharitably
of those who in like manner believe and act, as they are persuaded in their
hearts; and in prosecuting that whereby, (if it be offensive) greater offenses
may be avoided. This being well considered; as also, that there is no public
Liturgy, or private set Form of Prayer, extant to my knowledge, in the
Christian world so absolutely perfected of all occasions, persons, times,
places, but that it may justly, admit of some additions or alterations, except
only this which was recommended to his Church by our Savior, and is therefore
commonly called The LORDS PRAYER: this we ought to adhere unto as the only
standing Form and Pattern to be Universally received by all Christians, as it
has been by all true Believers ever since the first institution thereof; and
wherein, they ought unanimously to join without scruple, until the Kingdom
comes to perfection on earth, which we thereby pray for. Herein, we may all
together join in words comprehending every particular Member of Christ Jesus,
and his whole Mystical Body, speaking as it were with one mouth for and in the
name of all. And it contracts a common treasure of Mercies (though not in the
Popish sense, or to be disposable as that Church fancies) out of which every
Individual Member of the true Catholic Church, is relieved and provided for,
both to his temporary and spiritual well-being: yea, many millions before they
had any more then a potential Being, as also many after they had a visible
Being, were and are benefited thereby, and reduced from being despisers or
heedless of that gracious Provision which was made for them; and to the
enjoyment whereof their own prayers, whilst they were in that mind could not
else have brought them; no nor any other Mediator, but the Author of this
Prayer. Nevertheless, this excellent Form ought neither to be superstitiously
used as it is by some, or compulsively imposed upon any, who is conscienciously
scrupulous of using it, until he shall be fully convinced of that whereof he
doubts. The Christian Liberty which I take unto my self, and allow to all
other men, in things relating to God and their Consciences, I have as occasions
were from time to time offered, declared in several Tracts heretofore written,
intending nothing in a disrespective way of opposition, to any National
Churches, or Particular Congregations, or Persons, except to the malignant
Conventicle of Antichrist only; but that all they who have protested against
it, may agree together in that Truth, to the glory of God, and to the mutual
edifying of each other in love. For,

The Spouse of Christ has Daughters many a one;
But, so fair as their Mother, she has none:
However, to the blackest, fair befall;
For, I have an affection for them all.
11. I have made this Preamble larger then I thought it would have been when I
began; but it is not material whether I preach in the Porch, or in the Church,
so I teach true Doctrine, and may respectively be heard. Many Precautions,
appearing necessary to prevent such Objections as might probably obstruct my
good purpose, have occasioned the spinning of so long a thread: yet, I shall
presume to make a little longer, to clear the way to a right understanding and
use of that which Christ has left to his Church, both for a Pattern of Prayer
and Praise, and to make that more plain which I have touched upon before. The
Romanists will have that, and all Public Prayers, made in the Latin Tongue,
as being now the holy Catholic Language; and as if the Unity of the Church in
Prayer, consisted in speaking the same words, though not understood: which is
an Antichristian Principle, wherein lies a grand cheat. Some, who join in
words that they understand not, moved in Conscience toward God to do as they
are taught, (and knowing no other way of serving and worshipping) may, as I
believe, pray in and by the Spirit, helping them in their ignorance, as Paul
seems to imply: but the Doctrine and practice of their Teachers, is directly
contradictory to that Apostles practice, and demonstrates by what spirit they
are guided. We ought to pray both in the Spirit, and with our understanding
also, as far as it will extend. This Prayer may be used in the Original words,
or in any other Language, by them who understand it, and in our Mother Tongue,
translated into such words as contain the true sense thereof. It comprehends,
as is aforesaid, explicitly or implicitly, all things whatsoever essentially
pertinent to the glory of God, and the well-being of his people in general and
in particular, throughout all times, and upon all occasions: insomuch, that by
conforming to that Pattern, or the sense thereof, though in variety of
Languages, the Catholic Church may be truly said to retain an Uniformity of
Prayer, and be preserved guiltless of offering by strange fire, and of making
petitions repugnant to Gods will, or contradictory to each other, or
unprofitable to the Petitioners, though the Devotions of individual persons, be
not perfectly hallowed according to the purity of the whole Sanctuary. Yet
still, a mere formal and superstitious use thereof, makes it not only
ineffectual, but offensive, in stead of being an Oblation acceptable to God. As
when it is but verbally repeated for fashion sake, without reverence or heed to
what we say; or, when according to the Popish mode, so or so many Pater Nosters
(as they call them) are huddled up by tale, and a meritoriousness ascribed to
such ridiculous performances; which is not only by them attributed to that
empty Vanity, but a Supererogation also, deserving so much over and above the
supplying of each Petitioners personal wants, to increase their
Church-Treasury, that it affords enough (as they pretend) to sell, or confer to
the advantage of whom their Supreme Officer pleases, to ease or deliver out of
her feigned Purgatory, them whose own merits were not sufficient to discharge
them thence, by the merits of Jesus Christ. This, and other superstitious
abuses of the Lords Prayer, has caused many to misapprehend or neglect the
right use thereof; and the ignorance which is in some well-meaning Believers,
of that large portion of their duties, and of Gods revealed will and gracious
intentions, couched in those few words, has made them prefer their own and
other men's imperfect conceptions before it, and to offer up sometimes foolish,
uncharitable, and presumptuous requests, tending only to the fulfilling of
their own lusts, and lengthened out with many vain Tautologies and repetitions,
rendering it otherwhile wearisome to themselves, and neither pleasing to God or
men. I being desirous to prevent and cure such vanities and errors in my self
and others, was inclined to endeavor it by seriously meditating this Form of
Prayer, dictated by our Savior, without taking notice what other men had
thence extracted, even by wholly depending on the assistance of that Spirit
which can best inform what was intended by the Author, lest I might be
pre-possessed with such Notions and Opinions, as have misled others into a
misunderstanding. And, I beseech all those to whom these Meditations may come,
even in the love of Jesus Christ, and for his sake and their own, not to read
them by scraps, without heeding the whole Context, (as it has often happened
both to the Readers disadvantage and mine, in perusing some of my former
Writings:) nor to presuppose that I have inserted any Clause with an intent to
please or displease any for my own personal advantage, or to the injurious
disadvantage of any who are of a contrary judgment to mine; lest that
prejudice begets hatred, and lets into them such an evil Spirit as will never
be driven out again by any Charmers, though the Charmer charm never so wisely;

12. To prosecute my intention without interruption, God lately gave me a fit
opportunity, by shutting me up, as it were, from the world, and the world from
me; which being declared with such circumstances as occurred, may perhaps make
that which I have meditated, the more effectual to some; and to that end I will
here insert it. During the great Mortality yet continuing, and wherein God
evidently visited his own Household, his Enemies took not only notice thereof
with insultation, as if it nothing concerned them in the way of correction, but
presumed also they should be advantaged thereby. At the same time my little
Family, consisting of three persons only, was visited; and I, with my dear
Consort, long detained in daily expectation of Gods Divine purpose concerning
our persons; yet with confidence whether we were smitten or spared; lived or
died, it would be in mercy: for, having nothing left to make us in love with
this world, we had placed our best hopes in the world it come; whereby,
sufficiently comforted, we entertained Gods Angel under our roof without fear
of Death or Hell, believing he was sent rather for good, then to do any
execution to our detriment. To uphold this belief, God had extraordinarily
prepared before that day of trial, such a competency of things needful in
sickness and health, to supply all wants, during such a time, as that
Visitation was likely to last, (or our lives, if it long continued) that, we
cast aside all care and fear of the future, applying our selves to that only
which best befitted out present condition, as free from all inward
disturbances, as if Health, Wealth, and Liberty, had been at full enjoyed, and
neither Pestilence, War, or Famine, within a thousand miles of our Habitation.
When I sought the World, I lost it, with all I had therein; so that if God had
not inclined his Servants to provide for me, I might truly have sung this old
Catch,

Now I am a Gallant; for, my Friends have left me
Neither Money in my Purse, nor a Rag to shift me.
But, they have been instrumental by their charity, to add one signal
Experiment more, to those many which I have heretofore had of the fulfilling of
this conditional promise, Seek first the Kingdom of God, and all other things
shall be ministered unto you: For, though I am a very negligent Seeker, carrying
about me many pricks in the flesh, and pull-backs tempting from that duty, the
mercy of God sufficiently supplied what was then wanting; and, by that portion
of a discerning Spirit which he has given me, I think it may be truly said, he
has fed me by Angels, by Men, yea, and sometimes by Ravens, so that few men in
my time, of my degree, can say, he bad such kind friends with so little desert,
or so many malicious enemies without just cause; and both so necessary to make
me well pleased with my Lot.

13. This made me desirous to spend those days of recluse, (which for ought I
knew might be my last) in what might glorify God, so far forth as my weakness
would extend, and to leave behind me somewhat, when dead, whereby my friends
might mind me to their benefit with comfort, as well as to give my enemies
occasion to say they are glad they shall be no more troubled with me.
Providence then inclined my heart to contemplate the foresaid Prayer, when I
seemed but ill accommodated to prosecute such an undertaking: for it was in the
eleventh Climacterical year of my life, and when, beside other bodily
infirmities, I was frequently assaulted with such as were perhaps Pestilential
Symptoms, and the Keeping of two Fires, requiring more then my Income, seemed
likely long to maintain, prosecuted my Meditations all the daytime, even in
that room wherein my Family, and all Visitants talked and dispatched their
affairs, yet was neither diverted or discomposed thereby, but, by Gods
assistance, finished my undertaking within a short time after the recovery of
my Servant (whose life God spared) not gathering ought, as Bees do, from
flowers growing without me, but, spinning out like the Silkworm, that only
which God had stored up within me. And having put into words, that which was as
it were distilled out of my heart by fire, (as were my Remembrances to this
Nation in the great Pestilence this time forty years) I do now, as a
Testimonial of my thankfulness, bequeathe it to my friends, by whose Charity, I
was then, and heretofore, seasonably furnished with such necessaries as have
hitherto preserved me and mine from likely rnine: and in the first place offer
it for a Thank-Oblation to God, who enabled me to finish it during those few
days which I might probably have conceived would have concluded my life. GOD
the Father, GOD the Son, GOD the Holy Ghost, one Eternal Deity, always jointly
cooperating intrinsecally by invisible workings, (and distinctly, in what is
externally personated by a triple manifestation thereof to our humane
Capacities) sanctify me, and all my thoughts, words and actions, to his glory,
now and for ever. Amen.

THE PREFACE OF The LORDS PRAYER.
Offering many Particulars to consideration, pertinent to other Duties an
Objects of our Christian Faith; as well as to the true understanding and right
use of that Prayer, without imposing upon any, ought more then he shall
conscientiously believe* till convinced by better informatiion; which the
Author humbly prays all his Readers to remember, for prevention of uncharitable
Prejudice.
Matthew 6. 9. After this manner pray ye; or, as it is written, Ink. 12. 2.
When ye pray, say; Our Father which are in Heaven, hallowed be thy Name: Thy
Kingdom come; thy Will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day
our daily bread: And forgive our debts, as we forgive our debtors; and lead us
not into temptation, but deliver us from evil; For, thine is the Kingdom, the
Power and the Glory, for ever. Amen.
OUr blessed Redeemer, having in the words next preceding these, reprehended
these who used such vain Repetitions in praying, as the Heathens did (who
thought to be heard for their much babbling, or that God else knew not, or would
not heed their wants) It pleased him for preventing such practices and
misapprehensions, to leave this Catholic Form and Pattern of Prayer and
Praise, to his Apostles, and his Church for all future Generations; including
therein one conditional Petition, not grantable without performance of that
condition required; to wit, the forgiveness of our sins; which condition is
both Affirmatively and Negatively declared in these words next following: If
you forgive men their Trespasses, then will your heavenly Father forgive you:
But, if you forgive not them, then will not your heavenly Father forgive you.
This precaution is heedfully to be observed at all times, lest our Prayers be
turned into sin, and we imprecate a Curse upon our selves instead of a
Blessing: For, God is Love, and whosoever brings a Petition into his Presence,
with a malicious or implacable heart toward his Brother or Neighbor, shall
have all his suits rejected, and his sins (even his sins formerly forgiven)
recharged upon him, and be laid in prison until he has paid the utmost
farthing of his debts. That qualification for Prayer, is in this Generation
very defective in a great number: And perhaps it proceeds from a want of
Charity in this kind, (whereof their own consciences accuse them) that so many
have neglected the use of this Prayer; even because they cannot forgive as they
would be forgiven; and therefore are afraid to speak in that Form of words; not
considering that God remembers that condition though they mention it not in
their prayers, nor peradventure observe that, (though God sets before us his
Love and free forgiveness to be a Pattern whereto he requires conformity as
near as possible we can) he is not so severe as to expect our forgiveness
should equal his in perfection, but only in that proportion which our finite
and frail nature is capable of. This Hint is proper to the Fifth Petition, yet
not impertinently here offered to remembrance, because peradventure, some may
meet it here upon the threshold, who will never look further into the Book.

2. The Texts of Holy Scripture prefixed to this Prayer contain a Precept or
Injunction, teaching how to pray it: For, the Evangelist Matthew says, After
this manner pray ye, and St. Luke says, When ye pray, say thus: Our Father,
etc. whereof little more need to be said, then what the words and authority of
the Author sufficiently explains and warrants, to take away all scruple of
praying both in the same words, and according to their Genuine sense in such
other words, as the Spirit of God shall dictate unto our understandings upon
such occasions as are offered; for the two Evangelists by the words
afore-specified, the one biddding us to pray in this manner, and the other, to
say thus, makes this assertion doubtless; and they are very ignorant, who shall
either suspect the lawful use of a Form so authorized, or that the help to
Devotion thereby intended, was not as well vouchsafed to direct and enlarge our
conceptions in whatsoever is pertinent to the duty of Prayer, as to restrain us
from vain Tautologies, or other superfluous impertinencies.

3. As it is hinted in my preceding Preamble, our humane Capacity is not
capable of spiritual Objects (or to communicate them intelligibly to each
other) unless they are imbodied in some sensible Form: Therefore, in that
respect, this may be called the Body of Prayer; and I find it consists of a
Preface, six Petitions, and an Epilogue or Conclusion. The Preface is
comprehended in these words, Our Father which art in Heaven; in which there are
several particulars observable: first, that this Prayer is not singly
personated by this word MY, but, by the Pronoun Collective OUR, comprehending
many persons mysteriously incorporated; which implies that it is not to be
offered up to God, by Individual persons or congregations, with respect to
themselves only, or to their personal duties or necessities, but, with regard
also to the whole Catholic Church-Militant, and to the necessities of every
member thereof, in being, or in a potentiality of being; yea, in some respects
with regard to those Saints whose quondam visible being is at an end for a
while, considering their Resurrection to life Eternal, with all the Privileges
of the Everlasting Kingdom petitioned for in this Prayer, belonging to the
Quick and Dead, and concerns their Bodies now in the Grave, no less then their
bodies who yet live; and therefore they are to be comprehended In our Prayers,
in such respects, with those also, who were or shall be, as well as on the
behalf of our selves and of those who yet live, in regard they are Objects of
the Universal Faith, Charity, and Resurrection as well as we; and their
Resurrections no less necessary to be prayed for, then the Kingdom to come,
though both will come to pass notwithstanding we pray not for them. This
Doctrine will not be justly offensive to any, but to such as are very ignorant,
or prepossessed with much prejudice: For, this intends not prayers for the
Dead, according to the superstitious practice of the Church of Rome, nor upon
such considerations, nor to such purposes, as when they pray for Souls departed
out of this life. But, the Saints now at rest from their Labors and bodily
endeavors, having still (potentially at least) a spiritual Communion with us
and we with them, as members of Christ's Mystical Body (and who having as much
right as we to what appertains to the eternal Kingdom) are no more to be
excluded totally out of our Prayers, who yet live, then we were out of their
Prayers, and the Petitions of the Catholic Church, before we were born; it
being to me doubtless that their Devotions were then exhibited on our behalf,
by the Example of Christ our Head, of whom it is testified, John I7. I9. that,
when he prayed for his Apostles, he said, I pray not for these alone, but for
them also who shall believe on me through their word. This Prayer extends also,
to the preservation of all other Creatures, which being, as it were the Sons of
God by Creation, are said to groan together with us, Romans 8. 20. Even they
receive benefit with us, by this prayer, toward their subsistence and
perpetuity, which is metaphorically signified by daily bread. For, a natural
Instinct inclines them to demonstrate, in some sort, that which is equivalent
with a desire of what is wanting, though they neither know what they lack or
whence it comes: Even the vegetative Plants and Herbs evidence it by their
drooping, when they have overmuch or too little rain, or fair weather, and by
their refreshment with showers or heat; so do the Beasts also, when none being
present to relieve them, they bellow, and lift up their voices in their kind,
for want of meat. For these respects, the scope which this Prayer has in my
understanding, inclines my desire in the use thereof, to extend it to all
things and persons, that were, are, or shall be, for procuring of whatsoever is
therein explicitly or implicitly comprehended, as having an Universal
Relation: For, Privileges there are which the Saints Universally enjoy by a
Spiritual Communion, not heeded by the world, which will be demonstrated more
at large by my Meditations upon the twelve Articles of our Faith, commonly
called the Apostles Creed, if God gives me time and means to make it public,
and if I recover that part of it, which was taken from me, and being but short
notes to bring things to remembrance, will be of no use to those who have them.

4. By the right use of this Prayer, every Member of Jesus Christ is united in
his Mediation, the whole agreeing with the Head, and with each other, in all
Requests without contradiction; whereof I know not how we could have had an
assurance, save by this Medium: For, the speaking it in several Languages,
Times or Places makes no essential difference, or material dis-junction; nor do
the involuntary mistakes, or infirmities of the weakest Members render their
Sacrifice unacceptable, or ineffectual; because he to whom their Addresses are
made can and does reconcile such differences; and the whole Body being
ingratiated by the dignity of that Head, the most ignorant and insensible parts
thereof (if they separate not themselves wilfully and maliciously) are
partakers of that Faith which is in the whole, and of whatsoever is imparted
thereto, or conferred thereupon, by the merit and mediation of their Head and
Mediator; yea, as truly as the Inferior members of our Natural Bodies, whilst
they continue in their places, enjoy the benefits to them pertaining; and so
far forth, as they are capable of them, as the Tongue, Eyes, Ears and Heart,
though the other can neither speak, see, hear or understand as these do: And
the knowledge of this may be a great means of consolation to many a poor weak
Member of Christ, who is sensible of his personal defects. It is also by this
participation only, that we make good our affectionate desires and verbal
engagements or promises, to pray for our Friends or Relations in their several
necessities, absent or present; which we cannot so often and so particularly
remember as we would, if it were not done by an Universal concurrence in this
mode of praying to our heavenly Father, before whom, that which was but once
prayed for in Faith, continues always, as if we were always praying it, and as
if it were the joynt-act of the whole Catholic Church; for which respect
neither should a due application of this Prayer be neglected, or the great
advantages, thereby vouchsafed be unthankfully heeded. Moreover, by Christ's
teaching us in this Form of Prayer, to say Our Father, and not My Father, I do
conceive that in all our Desires and Petitions, we ought to have still heed and
regard to the necessities and welfare of others, as aforesaid, as well as to
our own; especially, of our Brethren relating to the same Father, though for
the present they be rebellious children; and that we should be wary, we seek
not the advance of a self-interest, by a Public detriments or, to the wrong of
any private person; or, to the infringement of Christian Charity, the want
whereof makes all Prayers ineffectual to them, who shall so pray.

5. The Father, there meant to whom our Addresses are to be made, and said to
be in Heaven, is the first Person of the Holy Trinity, (the other two Persons,
to wit, the Son and Holy Ghost being implicitly to be understood as one with
him in the same Deity) and we being a Brotherhood relating to the same Father,
warrants the foregoing Interpretation. God is the Father of all corporeal and
spiritual created Beings; and by that Appellative, we are encouraged to hope
and believe that we shall obtain whatsoever we petition for in this Prayer,
taught us by his best beloved Son, even to the utmost extent thereof; though we
our selves neither know or can mind all that is comprehended in those words;
because, as it is said, Rom 8. 26. The Spirit helps our infirmities, making
intercession for us, with groanings that cannot be expressed. This Form
contains nothing repugnant to his Fathers Will; and Christ has assured us,
That whatsoever we shall ask of his heavenly Father in his Name shall be
obtained; and doubtless it will be no bar to this assurance, when we ask
according to his own direction; yet, (knowing our infirmities) to confirm us in
that belief without wavering, he has made it probable by Inferences drawn from
our common experience, Luke 11. The one from that prevalency which constant
importunity has upon such Friends, as have but little sense of our
necessities; and the other drawn from the good effects which proceed even from
our imperfect natural affections, who are but earthly Fathers: For said he, If
a Son shall ask bread of any of you, who is a Father, will he give him a stone?
If he shall ask Fish, will he give him a Ser^^^? Or, if he ask an Egg, will he
give him a Se^^^^ Thereupon, he made this Inference: If then, you being evil
know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your heavenly
Father give the holy Spirit to him that asks it? Yea, he having given his
only Son for us, when we were his enemies, why should we distrust that he will
give us all other good things being reconciled unto him by his precious blood?
For, we have not only this GOD Almighty to our Father by Creation, as all
other Creatures have (which obliges us relatively both to him and to them) but
we are his Children also by Adoption, admitted thereunto by Grace through his
best beloved Son Jesus, thereto begotten by Faith in him; and he having drawn
up a Petition for us, taught us how to exhibit it, and warranted us to prefer
it unto him as our Father, what should discourage us from it? or what can
reasonably incline us to any other Form or Course? The tenderness which we know
to be in a good natural Father, is a strong Argument to preserve us from
despairing to obtain any thing in his power which he knows needful. But, GOD is
more truly our Father, then our Fathers in the flesh; for without his
concurrence in our Generation, we had neither been conceived nor born into the
world; or if his providence had not given us shape, nourishment, and
preservation till the birth; and he knows and still minds what he begets;
whereas our fleshly fathers seldom mind more then the satisfying of their
fleshly desires when they beget us; and know not what they beget until they see
it brought forth: Isaith says, 63. 16. unto God, Doubtless then art our
Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not; Thou,
O Lord, art our Father, our Redeemer, and thy Name is everlasting. These
considerations with the many demonstrations which we have had of Gods infinite
Love, Wisdom and Power, may assure he is neither ignorant of what is best for
us, nor unable, nor unwilling to confer it.

6. Though this be sufficiently demonstrated, it may be yet further illustrated
and ascertained by contemplating this short Preface; for to encourage us in
this Duty, and to increase and strengthen our Faith in prosecution thereof, He,
whom we are to solicit is said to be Our Father which is in Heaven. Not the
Father of our Flesh only, the best of which Fathers is both imperfect and
partial, even in the exercise of natural affections toward his own children;
neither equally distributing it among them, nor able to bestow upon them whom
he most loves, all those things which he knows necessary; nor is wise enough to
know what is best for them; nor sure of his own being, so long as his Children
may want his protection, or continuing assistance to provide for them; whereas
Our Father, by this Prayer invoked, is evidenced by the relative Pronoun WHICH
(considered with the words next preceding and following it) to have an eternal
Al-sufficiency to grant whatsoever is asked. For this word ART, being a Verb of
the present Tense, comprehending all Time, past, present, and to come, denotes
that Time (if Eternity may be so called) which is GODS Time only, and which
belongs to none but to him who is Eternity it self: For, we cannot say truly
of, or to any other, He is, or Thou art; because, before we can speak or think
out these words, he, of whom, or to whom, we speak, is in somewhat changed from
what he was, though it is not perceived. Therefore, when Moses asked of GOD,
what he should answer, if Pharaoh demanded who sent him; God said, Tell him I
AM, sent thee; and when GOD speaks of himself, as GOD the Father in the first
Person, he said, I AM the Lord thy God; when he speaks to his Son the second
Person, he says, Thou ART my beloved Son, etc. and when the Holy Ghost the
third Person is spoken of, it is said, He IS the Comforter, etc. all being in
the present Tense, which is Eternal. This sense being collected by me from the
connection of these words in this Preface, Our Father which art in heaven, much
fortifies my Faith in their use; and that which I extract from the last word in
this Preface adds a little more thereunto.

7. For Heaven, (which is the place of our Fathers residence, to whom this
Prayer is to be made) may somewhat more illustrate his Almightiness, and minds
us to approach his Presence with awful reverence, though that Appellative may
embolden us also in our Addresses. Heaven is that Beauty of Holiness, Joy and
Glory, wherein GOD dwells: It is an Infinite Object, supernaturally
intelligible, whereof I cannot apprehend so much by any natural means to me
knowable, as by turning my Intellectual Eye into my self, to contemplate that
unbounded Heaven, which appears within me; for that receptacle, seems to me,
infinitely more large then that Heaven, which I see above me and round about
me, with corporeal eyes; and he, who looking that way, finds GOD to have
therein an habitation, shall see more of him, and of heaven, then by any other
prospect whilst he is in the flesh; and thereby, know more of Hell also, if God
be not there, as in his own place: Yet Heaven is improperly conceived to be a
circumscribed place, the better to suit it to humane Capacities, which cannot
apprehend Objects beyond the extent of our narrow understandings; But, so much
thereof as is visible may give us intellectual Notions, in some degree of his
glorious and inexpressible Majesty to whom we pray, when we consider, That,
Heaven is his Throne, and Earth his Footstool; as also, That the Heaven of
Heavens cannot contain him: and from thence we may infallibly conclude that we
can have no secret sufferings, oppressions or afflictions whatsoever, which he
cannot take notice of in his Residency; or, any Oppressors so powerful, or
highly exalted, that, he cannot reach them to deliver us from them; in regard
he is both Vbiquitary, and so Inthroned, that neither we or they can be
concealed from his Eye, or secured from his Hand; which is manifested by these
words, Psalm 139. Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither shall I free
from thy Presence? If I ascend into Heaven, thou art there: If I descend into
Hell, thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the
uttermost parts of the sea: Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right
hand uphold me. If I say, darkness shall cover me: even the night shall be
light about me, etc. Which Scripture infers, that our Heavenly Father being
every where, His residence in Heaven, is not exclusive to His residence in all
other places at the same time: For, we must not imagine he is so in Heaven, as
a circumscribed Body is in a finite place, as all Created things are; or, as
the soul is in the body, which is said to be wholly in the whole, and in every
part thereof: For though that illustrates GODS being in his whole Creation, as
the soul thereof; and as truly as any similitude can, it nevertheless, comes
far short of expressing it to our understandings, who are so ignorant of our
own Beings, that, most are doubtful whether the soul be in the body or the body
in the soul. In my private Judgment, I think the soul contains the body; and
was partly thereto induced by this accidental experience. A Gentlewoman of my
Acquaintance, had her Leg cut off close below the Knee, who many years after
that Leg was buried, seemed to be so sensible of motion in her Feet and Toes,
and of itchings in the Leg and Foot, that, sometimes before she was aware what
she did, she would suddenly reach down her hand to scratch the place, as if her
Leg had still been there, and then laugh at her mistake. From whence I collect
that her soul (still extended an animating Faculty, to the whole dimension of
her body, when a part thereof had been long cut off) is rather the container of
the body, then contained therein; because, though that part had no being
wherein that operation might be actually exercised, as in a part of the body,
the soul was as entire as before. This digression, I leave to be considered by
others as their Judgment shall incline them, and perhaps it may be of some use.

8. Indeed our Almighty Fathers residence in heaven, and his universal Presence
is unexpressable; therefore, we must like weaned Children, in this and in all
other such like Mysteries, meekly submit to such illustrations as God has
vouchsafed, and makes us capable of, without admitting impertinent curiosities,
contenting our selves with those dispensations, which will then be rendered
sufficient for us; and make that acceptable to him, which we shall believe and
do, upon that account: And if we be but as wary as we may be, of what he has
revealed to preserve us from worshipping him according to our own Fancies, we
shall not be guilty of such gross Idolatries or Superstitions, as they are, who
make to themselves graven Images, or such spiritual Ideas, as may derogate from
the Majesty of God; and obscure the knowledge of him revealed in his Word, to
their own confusion; and cause others, to the hazard of their Souls and
Bodies, to sin against their own Consciences, by compelling or alluring them,
to disobey God rather then men: which mischieves cannot be avoided by those who
are not at all times careful to examine and try all spirits by the true
Standard; not only their own Light, and the Lights which are set up by humane
Authorities, but those Revelations also, that seem to be Angelically inspired,
what Infallibility soever shall be to them ascribed: For the Devil can
transform himself into an Angel of Light; and these later times, are so full of
Delusions and Impostures, that none shall escape them but they, who unfeignedly
and diligently, endeavor thus to do; therewith imploring Gods promised
assistance, and trusting thereupon. To these, are due the promises both of this
life, and of that which is to come, and they shall obtain their desire at full,
in due time upon earth, or have what is here wanting, supplied with a
superabundance, upon their souls hereafter. Other speculative Notions, I might
express by contemplating Heaven, the place of Gods Residence, and such as are
warrantable by his Word and Spirit; but, they cannot be yet born; and I fear I
have already, or, may in what follows, express so much more, then some will be
pleased withal, that I shall loose more Friends then I gain by it; but I will
discharge my Conscience, and Gods Will be done; Let other men do so, without
any sinister self ends, and I shall take no offense thereat. This is part of
that which I express or implicitly contemplate, when I repeat the preface to
the Lords Prayer. Now I proceed to the Petitions.

The first Petition.
Hallowed be thy Name.
1. THis Prayer consists of six Petitions; The first three, do principally
relate to the Glory of God: Not that he needs our Prayers for the advancement
thereof; for, he being Eternally, and all-sufficiently glorified in, and by
himself, these Petitions, have the first place in our Devotions, for our Avail,
and for the better preparing way to obtain that which is pertinent to our
selves; and which cannot in equity be granted, until we are in some degree
qualified, by conforming our wills and affections (...) the Mind of God; lest
the granting of our Natural desires, in temporary things, before they are
sanctified by the obtaining of some spiritual gifts, to the abating of that
Antipathy which is in us, to the purity of Gods Divine Nature, might totally
obstruct the obtaining what we pray for; and be more mischievous then the
denial thereof; as questionless, all temporal blessings would be, if conferred
upon us before we shall somewhat sympathize with our Heavenly Father, and show
it forth by affecting and seeking the accomplishing of that which he wills
and works: which Medium (if well considered) will appear to be both willed
and prosecuted by him, for our advantage, in the composure of this Prayer;
though the sanctifying of his Name, the Advent of his Kingdom, and the
completing of his Will, seems in terminis, to be the whole scope of the first
three Petitions. For the glorifying the Name of our Father, will be an honor to
us, who are his Children; The coming of his Kindom, will bring us deliverance
from those Tyrants, by whom we are oppressed; and, the fulfilling of Gods Will
here on earth as it is in heaven, will both free us from their Impostures, who
impose upon us an obedience to their Arbitrary wills, in the place of his; and
enlarge us from that slavish bondage of sin, whereinto we are brought by
seeking the accomplishment of our own carnal will. Thus, all things being done
according to Gods Will, Heaven will begin to appear upon Earth, where man's
wickedness and wilfulness has begun to make Hell. This exceeding Love of God
to mankind, in requiring no performances at our hands, for the glorify^^g of
himself, but what may conduce to our happiness also, should move us by his
exemplary Love, so unfeignedly to love him, and one another for his sake, that,
it may be accepted of, as a fulfilling of his whole Law: For the same
Philanthrophy, which is evidenced by his vouchsafing this Form of Prayer, was
manifest also in the Law of the Ten Commandments; the first Table whereof
relating primarily to himself, is as pertinent to that which tends to the
preservation and happiness of the humane Nature, as that which is contained in
the second Table (if not more) as I have made it evident by my Meditations upon
the Decalogue.

2. Hallowed be thy Name. This is the first Petition; and for the better
understanding of what is therein prayed for, the meaning of these two words,
HALLOWED and NAME must be explained and made known. A Name, is that whereby
Persons and things are distinguished each from other; and whereby it may be
ascertained, who, or what it is, whereof we speak: to which purpose, though
there is no Name pronounceable by Men or Angels, which can define God as he is,
it has pleased him to make himself in part known by several Names and
Attributes, some communicable, and some incommunicable to any Creature, as I
could demonstrate by enumerating those Names of GOD which are mentioned in Holy
Scripture. But, I will wave that, and insert so much only, as I conceive tends
to an intelligent use of this Prayer. Our English-tongue as well as the Hebrew,
has a Tetragrammaton, whereby GOD may be Named; to wit, GOOD, which seems by
our Saviors words to be incommunicable to any other; for said he, There is
none GOOD but GOD. He and his Name are one. He is Goodness, Wisdom, Power and
Love it self in the abstract, with whatsoever is superlatively excellent; and
by his Name I understand his Eternal Essence, and all his incommunicable
Attributes to be meant, as also, that in them he is to be sanctified, and
honored. And, whereas we are commanded Not to take his Name in Vain, I
conceive that intends as well affirmatively the hallowing of it according to
this Prayer, as negatively forbidding the profanation thereof; which consists
not only in calling him by Name, as it were, to witness the Truth of what we
affirm or deny; but also in praying unto him with due Reverence in Faith; with
an undoubted belief of his Promises; with a true sense of that which we
petition for; and with heedfulness that we profess his Name in sincerity, and
not formally alone, as many do, who are called Christians, without regard to
conform to the Doctrine and Practice of his Evangelical Law, which is the
greatest profanation of GODS Name, and more dishonor thereto, then all the
revilings and Blasphemies of Jews, Turks and Heathens.

4. The word Hallowed or Sanctified is ambiguous, having various
significations, and is derived from a Primitive Root, used in so differing a
sense, that it is sometimes applied to persons, who are as much disaffected and
contrary to each other, as most differing things are; to wit, SAINTS and
SEPARATISTS, for to separate is to sanctify, and to sanctify is to separate.
But herein is the difference between the Saint and the Separatist, as the words
are now used. The first willingly separates himself from the mystery of
Iniquity, and as much as in him lies from all the Errrors, Vanities and
wickednesses of the world, with an upright heart: The other wilfully separates
from the Truth, and from the Societies of all the Faithful professors thereof,
for mere carnal ends, with a perverse heart: and as there are many Canonized
and reputed Saints who are nothing less, so there are many branded for
Schismatical Separatists, who are far from deserving it. To be Hallowed or
Sanctified according to our common acceptance of these words, is to be
separated from that which is called profane or common, to be used in the
service of God, or to some other end, which is esteemed more honorable then
that for which it was formerly employed, though perhaps it is thereby sometimes
more profaned, and dishonored. The Israelites, now called Jews, were
separated, or Hallowed, as we term it, from all other Nations, to be a peculiar
people to God, and are still by some called the holy people, though as we mean
by Holy, I know no Nation in the world less meriting that Title, no, not his
Holiness of Rome. But, that which I understand by Hallowing or Sanctifying the
Name of GOD, and what we ought to contribute thereunto, is to magnify him, to
speak of his Excellency upon all occasions; to separate it, in our esteem and
love of his Perfection, so far from and above all other imaginable and real
Objects whatsoever, that they shall be rather despised and hated then admitted
to any degree of estimation answerable thereto. I have no means at this time of
my recluse, to take advice from the Dead or the Living, from Books or men; and
therefore cannot inform my self how the Schoolmen understand this Term, or any
other part of this Prayer; and perhaps it would but make me the less diligent,
to harken what the Spirit of GOD speaks to my heart. By help of that Spirit,
it seemed unto me discovered, that, there is a Triple Holiness, or separation
considerable in relation to God, touching which I may perhaps deliver that
which many will not approve; nevertheless I will freely declare my judgment,
as I usually do in such matters. God seems unto me Sanctified and separated by
way of superexcellency, from all other who are called Lords or Gods; from all
created Essences; from all intelligible Beings; and from all the potentialities
which were, are or shall be, in material and intelligible Essences united
together; and is one eternal Being, Hallowed by three glorious Manifestations,
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord GOD the Father, GOD the Son, and GOD the Holy Ghost,
coequal and coeternal. This I believe in order to the sanctification or
hallowing of GODS Name, and much more then I can express; yet this
peradventure, is more then the capacity of many can apprehend.

5. I will therefore endeavor to suit to the meanest Capacity, what I think
petitioned for in this Clause, and declare what I conceive is required from us,
toward sanctifying the Name of our heavenly Father, both negatively and
affirmatively. We must not imagine this daily duty is required of us, because
Gods Name cannot otherwise be perfectly sanctified, or that we merit ought from
him by so praying: For, his Name shall be Hallowed, whether we neglect or
perform that duty; and when we have thereunto contributed all that we can, we
are unprofitable servants. This is mentioned in our daily Addresses, to keep us
mindeful of what we ought to desire, and endeavor toward that which will be
done, whether we desire it or not; and that those invaluable blessings which
God of his free Grace has promised for performances (which in themselves are
worth less then nothing) may be conferred upon us by his Mercy, without
infringement of his Justice. His Name is so pure in it self, that no pollutions
of ours can defile it, because they revert always back upon our selves, if we
wilfully asperse it; and all that we can do toward the hallowing of it, is, as
I said before, to speak well of his Name, and to magnify it above all other
Names, which when we so do, his acceptance only makes it valuable. There is no
other Name by which Men or Angels are saved, or by which they can be preserved
from relapse; and therefore, all knees in Heaven and Earth, ought to bow
thereunto with reverence; I mean, to the Essential Name, not to the literal
expression or vocal sound thereof, which is an Idolatrous or at least a
superstitious Fancy, as is the ascribing of a Divine Holiness to any humane
Medium, intended to be but instrumental to bring us to him who is most Holy;
yea, it is Idolatrous, though that adoration be given to a Creature separated
from all other, by as glorious a sanctification, as the Blessed Virgin Mary's,
and the rest of GOD'S most eminent Saints.

5. Our Savior has wrapped up implicitly, our Interest with our heavenly
Fathers in this Petition: For, as in the First Commandment of the Decalogue,
GODS injoyning us to have no other Gods but himself only, intended thereby our
Good, as well as his own Glory; so did his Son Jesus Christ, in teaching us to
pray that our Fathers Name may be Hallowed; for, as by obedience to the first
Commandment, and separating him and our selves from all false reputed gods,
with whatsoever else we affect more then God; and by ascribing and performing
Divine Worship to him alone, we shall not only prevent the ascribing his
incommunicable Attributes to base unworthy Creatures, abominable Idols and
Devils, as the Heathen did; and thereby avoid that dishonouring of him, by
Hallowing persons, places or things common into a partnership with the Divinity
of God, as it is usual with some in these times: But we shall also escape
thereby many mischievous disadvantages, and receive great benefits: For,
mankind was plunged into manifold perplexities, fears, despairs and
deceiveable hopes, by that multiplicity of false gods which the First-times had
forged, to the inslaving and destruction of their consceiences and persons;
for, they not knowing how to please one of their feigned gods without incurring
the disfavour of another, it occasioned perpetual anxieties and insupportable
burdens, by erecting and furnishing magnificent Temples; offering frequent
Hecatombs, and other costly Sacrifices; visiting Oracles and Shrines; giving
rich presents; with innumerable other superstitious Ceremonies, to pacify and
ingratiate themselves with those Hobgoblings, which their own deluded fancies
had created, and set up to be adored. And no fewer are their distractions, and
the mischiefs on them incumbent in these days, who have in another mode
Separated, Canonized and Hallowed (as they call it) Persons, Places, and things
common, to participate with GOD, and his CHRIST, in that which is proper and
communicable to no other. They have consecrated for Saints, and presumed to
give them Thrones in Heaven, who, for ought any man living knows, may be Devils
in Hell. They have Hallowed unto them Temples, Oratories, Shrines, Altars and
temporary possessions; They have made them their Patrons, and the peculiar
protectors of their Countries, Families, Persons and Affairs; yea, and of their
Religion, (though they never professed or favored it:) They have separated
them from all other, and Hallowed them to be their personal Advocates, making
them equal with Jesus Christ in his Mediatorship; yea, sometimes preferred them
before him. They have dedicated unto them days, times, their goods,
possessions, yea, and their Children to pass through the Fire of their
superstitious Orders and Observations, as the Israelites did their Children to
Moloch, out of a slavish fear, which nevertheless accompanies them to their
Graves. They have hazzarded, and many of them lost their lives by long
Pilgrimages, inhumane penances, and other such like improfitable undertakings
thought to be Meritorious, which God required not at their hands, but abhors
them; expecting no more but those reasonable Services, which he himself has
commanded, and may be performed, with acceptance, through his promised
assistance; and with ease and comfort, both to soul and body, in all such
duties as he injoyns; and in all such trials, as he exposes us unto: And when
it succeeds otherwise, to our temporal or spiritual damage, it it because we
Hallow such things as are not to be Hallowed, and neglect to Hallow GODS Name
as we ought to do, above all other Names and things: yea, the Hallowing of so
many other Names and things, instead of out Heavenly Fathers Name, which should
singly and solely be separated and sanctified, has been the prime cause of all
those many Sects, Heresies, Treacheries, Divisions, Quarrels, Wars and Murders
among Nations, Neighbors and Brethren throughout the World; and, the respect
of Christ to us, as well as to the glory of his Father, in teaching us to pray
for the sanctifying of his Name, is an evidence of his great love and Mercy to
mankind.

The second Petition.
Thy Kingdom come.
1. THis Petition consists of but of three words; yet affords much to be
considered: for, every word has an emphasis which makes their connection to
imply many observable Particulars, besides that sense which is plainly
expressed; to wit, that there is a Kingdom yet to come, which we ought to pray
for. The middle word, shows that there is such an expectant Kingdom; The first
word THY, that it is his Kingdom to whom we pray: The last word COME, that it
is to be expected. I will begin with the word KINGDOM. A Kingdom is among men a
Government belonging to a single Person, whom the Latins called REX, a
regendo, of governing, and implies one qualified for that Duty. We in English
call him a King, which is a word derived from what is signified by these two
Old Saxon words united, Kan and Ken, that is, to be Able, and to Know; or,
Power and Wisdom, thereby implying that a King who will Govern well, ought to
be endowed with Prudence and Power. For true Wisdom, whose Original is the fear
of GOD, includes Justice, Mercy, Magnanimity, Sanctified policy, Constancy,
Temperance, with all other virtuous qualifications; and by Power, is intended
all means whatsoever, whereby those Virtues may be put into execution for
discharge of his office; that, thereby the Kings of the Earth might officiate,
as much as is possible, in imitation of their Sovereign, the Supreme King of
Heaven and Earth. I know no people under Heaven, except these Nations within
our British Isles, who have a Word or Title, for their Supreme Governor in
their own Language, which so truly constitutes him a Regulated Monarch, and
whose signification so minds and obliges him to Govern accordingly: For,
these words, Emperor, Grand-Seignior, Prince, Duke, or suchlike, with those
words whereby in the Languages of other Countries they intend him who with us
is called a King, signify nothing but an absolute Superiority and priority of
Dignity, without intimating ought purposed thereby, for the welfare of their
Subjects; as the common interpretations of so many of those Appellations, as I
know, do declare. Such Names were at first ascribed either by base flatterers,
or else assumed to themselves, by those who affected and usurped an exorbitant
arbitrary Power, in the exercise whereof the signification of their Tiles were
an encouragement, seeming to oblige them to no more then to Govern by their
will and pleasure only. Whereas the word King in our tongue implies that our
Sovereign should be both Wise and Powerful, and as wise as powerful; (Wisdom
comprehending Justice, Mercy, and all other Virtues) and our Law presupposing
him also, so to be at all times (because to be otherwise, destroys the
essentiality of Kingship) has in it, this fundamental Maxim; A King can do no
wrong. Such as the king is, such is the Kingdom, or Government; and such will
be the people; as we find it to have been in all the Kingdoms of the Earth.
But, the King and Kingdom for whose coming we pray, are stablished by Wisdom
and Power so perfect, that no wrongs can be done by the King thereof, nor any
suffered by those who are under him, by any unrighteous Law in that Kingdom;
and happy are those Kings and the Subjects of those Kingdoms who endeavor to
Govern and Obey according to the righteousness of that King, and the
Constitutions of his Kingdom, so near as they shall be able. To that end, the
same Kingdom is partly come into those in this Generation, who belong
thereunto, to show it forth to Kings and Subjects, in the Kingdoms of this would
by their Doctrine, Life and Conversation, that the Contemners thereof may be
inexcusable: For though it seems to be a Kingdom not now in being, but to come
hereafter, it is an Eternal Kingdom, which now is, always was, and ever shall
be, without beginning or ending; and, is termed a Kingdom to come, in respect
of that more full manifestation which it shall have, here upon Earth, and
within the Saints, who are and shall be sharers therein, reigning together with
Christ. Some call it the fifth Monarchy (as it is, in relation to those
Monarchies prophesied of by Daniel) but it is the first that ever was, and the
last that ever shall be in Heaven or Earth; and is such a Kingdom as we are not
able (in the state wherein we yet be) to conceive, much less to express, in
that mode wherein it shall be manifested, though we have many metaphorical
descriptions of it, whereby we may apprehend so much of the Glory of it, as may
make us believe and expect it with joy.

2. The Sovereignty of this Kingdom was eternally in the Deity before all
worlds, and after the Creation was jointly and distinctly exercised by the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost, according as the Manifestations thereof, were
decreed before time, and evidenced by occurrences in the progress of Time,
Thereof, I will declare so much as God has revealed unto me by his Word and
Spirit. During that, intelligible point of Time which was called Beginning
(being the first of those five Notions, wherein I conceive all things to be
included, to wit Eternity, Beginning, Time, End and Everlasting) even in that
Moment of Beginning, and immediately after the Angels and Adam were created and
Fell; the Prince of the Spirits elapsed began to Usurp a part of Gods Kingdom,
by that permissive Power which he still retained; and he forthwith practiced
upon innocent Man, on whom God had conferred a Vicegerency under himself over
all subcelestial Creatures: And Adam being compounded of those Elements, which
rendered him subject to mutability, the Devil, prevailing by subtlety, drew him
to disobedience and rebellion; which, God foreknowing might (had he so pleased)
either have prevented it, or in a moment destroyed the Usurper with all his
Confederates. But this consisted not with his Eternal Decree, whereby mankind
was to have experience in a natural way of that Good and Evil which our
First-Parents desired to know. Therefore, according to the same Decree, God
suffered that part of his Kingdom which was to be visible on Earth, to be for a
while shared between two contradictory Powers: the Devil, to continue in
possession of what he had Usurped, and his Eternal Son (to whom the whole
Kingdom by right appertained) to exercise also his Kingly Office therein, so
far forth, as neither his Interest, with that which is really good might be
totally destroyed, not the Devils power so limited, that the utmost extent of
evil might not be fully known; so here has been ever since, two Militant
Kingdoms upon the Earth, contending for Superiority.

3. The Incarnate Son of GOD was first externally inaugurated, when it was
said, that The seed of the Woman should break the Serpents head, and the
Messiah was then spiritually conceived by Faith in the hearts of Adam and Eve,
and there began this Kingdom to be first in the earth, though the seed of the
Serpent, did also fructify by that seminal corruption which he had injected to
make entrance for his Kingdom: And when their two first Children being born
into the world, Had attained ability to demonstrate unto which Kingdom they
adhered, the Contest which has ever since been maintained between them, did
presently begin: Cain slew his Brother Abel upon that quarrel; and the
consequence thereof, together with Cains male-contented Demeanor, gave
occasion of GODS declaring somewhat unto him, which I conceive to be pertinent
to their consideration whose Faith and Patience were to be exercised under
tyrannous Governments in all future Generations, until his Son shall bring them
to an end, by assuming the whole Kingdom: For, before Cain had slain his
Brother, God said, That he should Rule over him, and his desire be subjected
unto him. Moreover, after the murder was committed, and when GOD had so cursed
Cain for it, (who was the first Tyrannous abuser of his Authority) that by the
judgment of his own conscience, he seemed worthily exposed to slaughter by
every one who met him; God nevertheless affirmed, that, whosoever slew him, his
blood should be avenged sevenfold upon the slayer; and it is written that God
set a Mark upon him, to prevent his slaughter; from whence it may be inferred
(as I think) that all Private persons ought to be wary they lay not violent
hands upon those to whom God has subjected them, how wicked soever they be,
lest, that Mark be fouud upon them, which renders them liable to a sevenfold
Vengeance.

4. The visible Kingdom of GOD our Father, How it was conferred upon his Son;
What opposition it should have in the world by Kings and Nations; The Vanity
of their Reasons of State; the fruitlesness of the Plots, Counsels and
confederacies of the people: The establishment of his Throne upon his holy
Mountain the spiritual Sion, in despite of opposition; The proclamation of
what was eternally decreed concerning it; The Universality and powerfulness of
his Domion; How it will beseem all earthly Kings, and their subordinate Judges,
and Officers to demean themselves under him; What will befall to them who shall
be rebellious or refractory, and the happiness of all those who shall do homage
unto him, and be obedient as they ought to be: All this was foretold in the
second Psalm, which is a Literal, not a Typical Prophecy of the Kingdom of
Christ, the true David; Yet, this Kingdom had for a long time, a very slow
increase, was confined to a very narrow circuit, and has been from that time
hitherto also, of small estimation in respect of the Kingdoms of this World;
except only in the days of Enos and Noah; for in the days of Enos it is
recorded, that men began to call upon the Name of the Lord: and in the time of
Noah, this King of kings, assumed the sole Government of his Kingdom into his
own hands; proclaimed his fore-intended Judgments to all his Subjects for
their cruelties and rebellions; and, at the time appointed, executed his
sentence of Condemnation to the Destruction of all the Oppressors, Tyrants, and
Kingdoms of the Earth, by Water; as he will after Christ's last coming, by
Fire* and what will then become of his proud and malicious Enemies, it may
easily be foreseen.

5. A while after the Deluge, during the Paternal Kingship of Noah, the Kingdom
of our Father prevailed: but within a few years after the Flood, the kingdom of
the Devil begun to be again enlarged; and, that of GOD, to be thrust into a
little Room, and for some Generations to be visible in a few Families only, so
obscured, that, the world took small notice thereof, uutil the times of Moses
and Josuah, in whose days the judgments executed upon Pharaoh, and on the
Cananites made it evidently manifest, that there was a more Powerful King, then
those who usurped the Kingdoms of the Earth. And though this Kingdom was again
after that, obscured several times, by their wickedness who professed obedience
thereto; yet, the power of it appeared more and more, especially, during the
Reign of David, Solomon, Jehosophat, Ezekias and other Kings of Judah; yea, and
was much heeded by the prevalency which it had, in some degree, upon
Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus and Darius, three of the greatest; Earthly Monarchs, who
were constrained to confess the power of their Supreme Sovereign; and, it had
some other manifestations thereof before the true King thereof appeared in the
Flesh: But, then it began to show it self, in another mode, so differing from
all temporary Kingdoms, that it seemed to the men of the world, to have nothing
in it like a Kingdom, and the King thereof to be nothing less then a King. For,
a mean Carpenter was his reputed Father; a poor Virgin was his true Mother;
when he was born, she had no Palace, but a despicable Inn to give her
entertainment; No Chamber to lodge in, but a Stall with Beasts; No Cradle under
a rich Canopy to lay this King in, but a Manger; No Heralds, but Shepherds to
proclaim his Birth, and call him a high and mighty Prince, as is usual at the
Birth of Kings; But, that defect was recompensed with a Complement more
Magnificent then the Nativity-Ceremonies, of all other Kings put together: For,
a glorious Angel brought them a Commission to publish it; A Celestial Army
celebrated his Birth, with a Nativity-Song; and the kings of the East came to
do him homage, and brought him presents, being directed unto him by a Star.

6. When years had rendered him fit to exercise his Kingship, according to what
was proper to the Initiation thereof; he had no great Palace to dwell in; no
not a place wherein to rest his head. He had no Princes, Dukes; Marquesses or
Earls to attend him, but a few despised Fishermen; instead of a triumphant
Chariot, he rode through jerusalem, upon the silly Foal of an Ass; and instead
of a Footcloth, the people put their Garments under him. When he came to be
Inthroned, with his Title in three Languages written over his head, his Royal
Apparel, was a Purple Robe contemptuously cast upon him; he was scornfully
saluted as King in mockage only, reviled and spit upon; To be a Septer, they
gave him a Reed; instead of a golden wreath beset with precious Stones, they
Crowned him with sharp Thorns; his Throne was a Cross, whereto they nailed his
hands and his feet; There he gave up his Ghost, and having no Sepulcher of his
own, was buried in another man's Grave. This is quite contrary to the mode and
pomp, of the Kings and Kingdoms of this world; yet, even then, (as at his
Birth) his dignity was extraordinarily evidenced; for by the power of his
Almighty Godhead, he, to the affrighting of his Enemies, obscured the Sun by a
a supernatural Eclipse; he rent the Vail of the Temple, shook the whole Globe
of the Earth; raised the Dead but of their Graves, and himself again to life;
conquered Death and Hell; showed himself alive to his Disciples, ascended up to
Heaven in their sight; and, when the Devil and his confederates supposed his
Kingdom to be everlastingly at an end; it became so signally powerful, in that
external weakness and contempt whereby it seemed to be disabled, if not
annihilated; that, it destroyed, all the sumptuous Temples of the Gentles, with
those gods which they therein worshipped; yea, the Temple and Religion of his
Crucifiers, who boasted and trusted in the holiness thereof; and this King and
Kingdom will at last, utterly root out of the world, that mystery of iniquity,
which has been raised up since the subversion of heathenish and Jewish
Opposers thereof; even that great Malignant Kingdom (with all the supporters
and vassals thereof) which has now tyrannized in several forms over the
Saints, and Subjects of the King of kings almost six thousand years. But
notwithstanding all this, Christ's now pretended Vicar, though he calls himself
the servant of the servants of God, and makes counterfeit shows of humility (as
many others do) is not contented with such a Kingdom; and therefore, has
reduced his into such a one, as makes it apparent he has accepted of as much
as he could get, of that offer with Christ refused, when the Devil tendered
unto him the Kingoms of the world, with all the glory of them, on condition he
would fall down and worship him.

7. It seems by what is recorded of the Tribe of Issacher to their
commendation, 1 Chro. 12. that we are to take notice of what concerns the times
wherein we live, and perhaps it will not be impertinent to the Kingdom here
mentioned, to add what I am inclined to express, by occasion of Letters and
Reports much credited concerning an Army of Israelites repairing toward the
Ancient Habitation of their Forefathers, which, was heretofore a visible
Province of that Kingdom, until the Inhabitants for their Treason and Murder
committed against their Sovereign Lord, (or the greatest party of that Nation)
were thereupon rejected, and scattered through the world, to wander as
Vagabonds like Cain (their Type) without any certain abiding place. That is,
the condition of those who at this day are called Jews; but whether they are
assuredly the Offspring of the Patriarks Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, neither I
nor they know, as I believe: For, I understand not how they in these parts of
the world commonly reputed to be of the Tribe of Judah, and of those other
Tribes which adhering thereto, continued in their own Country, until about
forty years after the Crucifying of their Messiah, can possibly know whether
they are Jews or not so, considering that throughout Europe (as Histories
inform us) they were not only banished and expelled from place to place, but
the Records of their Genealogies taken away also, and burnt. A great number
likewise (if not the greatest number) of those whom we term Jews, are probably
such Natives of the Countries wherein they have long lived, who embracing the
Jewish Heresy, made themselves liable to that heavy curse, which they
imprecated upon themselves and their Posterity, who, when they crucified
Christ, wished his Blood might be upon their heads, and the heads of their
Children. These therefore, I suspect to be in no better estate, then they, of
whom it was said, Revel. 3. 9. They shall be made of the Synagogue of Satan,
because they said they were Jews, but were not so.

8. They, who are now reported to call themselves Israelites, and to be the
Posterity of those who were carried out of their own Country before the
Babylonish Captivity, and said to have been ever since obscured, as it were,
from the world, and now repairing to possess the inheritance of their
Forefathers, are not to us ascertained to be such as they are famed, or to
have made that egress, and progress lately reported; For, we have yet received
no Letters, that I hear of, from any of our Merchants or Factors trading in or
near those parts; (but all seems to come from one root) I shall therefore
believe neither matter of Fact, nor what some conjecture will be the
consequence of that Rumor, till better evidence thereof; nor will miscensure
their charitable hope, who already believing what they hear, conceive it may
possibly be a Preparatory, to that Conversion of the Jews which is by them
expected. I confess I have heretofore staggered to and fro, between my hope and
fear concerning that people; For, there are several places in the Old
Testament, so variously interpreted by Learned and Pious men, that I dare not
peremptorily conclude one way or other, because those Prophecies are not yet
unquestionably unsealed to me; And perhaps left Ambiguous for Probation of our
Faith and Constancy, who were to live in this last Age of the World, wherein
there would be so many great Impostures and false Miracles, as have been
foretold. We busy our selves in matters which little or nothing belong unto
us, out of a vain curiosity; and by mistaking the true meaning of what we read
in Holy Scripture, suppose that which was never intended, neglecting the mean
while our duties in that which is plainly declared, and more concerns us. As in
several places of S. Paul's Epistles, particularly touching the Jews, Romans 9.
which (as wiser men then I, understand it) did principally relate to that
Nation in the Apostles time, and to abate the Gentiles presuming on themselves,
as also their miscensure of the Jewish total Apostasy and Rejection, rather
then to infer such consequences as many supposed.

9. I will look to my own calling, and seek to secure my safe standing, as God
by his Grace enables me, praying for the Calling and Conversion of Jews, Turks,
Heathens, and for all Heathenish and Jewish Christians in Gods time and mode;
thinking of them as I find they are, until I more plainly perceive what God and
they will do. I believe the Vision of dry Bones, which received Flesh and Life,
concerns both Jews and Gentiles; And know, if God so pleases, a Nation may be
born and regenerated in a day; and that a people may be kept hidden from the
rest of this wide world, in some part thereof, till he may thence bring them
forth again in his appointed time, none knowing how, or from whence, as he does
Swallows and other Birds in their seasons; which yearly come we know not from
whence, and go we know not whither. Nevertheless, I do not think he will do all
that he can, or that we are bound to believe, what Interpreters of dark places
in Holy Scripture, shall conjecture to be the meaning wherein the wisest of
them contradict each other; especially when it concerns not our saving Faith,
but the Temporary Restoration of the Jews, to an earthly Possession; Who, for
ought I yet hear, have given us so little show of a Repentance preparatory to
their Conversion, that this may be a temptation to a further hardening of them,
and of Apostasy in some among us, if God prevent it not. For, it seems not to
me improbable (considering the near approaching of Christ's Kingdom) but that,
the grand Antichrist, and all other petty Antichrists with their confederates,
will improve their several Mysteries of iniquity to the utmost, that their
Supreme Prince the Devil, may gather together a Rabble pretending to be Jews
extraordinarily congregated, by Divine Providence, to delude those who profess
a belief in the true Messiah already come. We were by our Savior forewarned to
take heed we were not then deceived, in regard many Deceivers would come in his
Name, to the deluding even of the Elect so far as possible: And when he had
foretold the signs and wonders which should precede his second coming (being
such as have been more frequent in our days then in any one Age (nay, I think
more then in many Ages) since Christ's Ascension, he added, that in the days he
spoke of, false Christ's and false Prophets should arise, showing such signs
and wonders that it would hazard the Elect as aforesaid. Therefore said he,
Whosoever shall say, Lo here is Christ, lo there is Christ, believe it not.
If they shall say unto you, He is in the Desert, go not out: Or, if they shall
say he is in the secret Chamber, believe it not: For, as the Lightning comes
out of the East, and shines into the West, so shall the coming of the Son of
Man be. It is said in another place, that, the Kingdom of GOD is within those
who belong thereunto; which, if we find it to be in us, we shall be able to
discern Impostures; and if it be not so with us, the Israelites who are now
famed to be come into the Deserts of Arabia, will nothing avail us, to what
purpose soever they come.

10. Their Temporal Kingdom concerns them only, and not us who claim interest
in a better, and know that the most glorious earthly Kingdoms are but Vanities
and Snares in respect thereof; And if there be any Prophecy in the Old
Testament thereto relating; and unsealed to them and others, it is not so to
me, and until it shall be so opened) that I may be assured thereof (and till I
shall think it also more pertinent to Gods glory then yet I do) my belief will
be suspended. That midnight is very near, or not far off, of which it was said,
Matthew. 25. 6. Behold the Bridegroom comes, go forth to meet him; But, this is
not such an Outcry, but made by the Voices of men only, which are so deceitful,
that we see cause almost every day, to believe the contrary of that which we
believed yesterday. I therefore cannot believe it will be any other Voice, then
that of the anointing Spirit within the Children of Christ's Kingdom, which must
prepare them for that whereof no outward Intelligencers can give a certain
Information; because the evidence of Christ's Kingdom depends not upon external
Observations, but upon that evidence within us, which is confirmed by the Word
infallibly interpreted by the Spirit, and cherished by that Anointing Oil which
the foolish Virgins never had in their Vessels; nor they, who pretend they have
it to sell. I heartily pray we may be found among those wise Virgins who were
watchful, that we may distinguish the Bridegrooms voice from Impostors, lest we
be shut out from entering when he comes.

11. I hereby intend nothing in opposition to them who believe the Rumors
aforementioned, but leave them to credit them as they are persuaded, until they
find cause to the contrary, expecting from them the like indulgence to me: For,
if I hear unquestionably, that such a remainder of Israel, by Miracles and
Divine instinct, are come into their ancient Inheritance, shall there be settled
by way of preparation; Then having Repentance wrought in them, shall have their
eyes opened to see by Faith, and confess with their mouths, that Jesus Christ
whom their brethren betrayed, sold and crucified, was their promised King, I
shall know it is of God, and rejoice in it as much as any: But, till then, I
shall be wary of giving credit to what I, hear, and wish all other men so to
do, least they be deluded, by mistaking the meaning of those Prophets, who
foretold the bringing back the Captivated Israelites to their Country, thinking
those Predictions which were fulfilled before, and at Christ's first coming, are
still expectant, as relating to their Temporal Kingdom. For, I believe that the
gathering together of the dispersed Israelites presaged by the Prophets,
intended not those only which were Jews according to the Flesh, but those Jews
and Gentiles who are the spiritual seed of Abraham, by Faith, dispersed
throughout the World, and such Jews as Paul meant, Romans 2. 28, 29. where he
says, He is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision,
which is outwardly in the flesh; but, he is a jew who is one inwardly, and
Circumcision is that of the heart, and in the Spirit, not in the Letter; which
being so, we may justly suspect they have mistaken the meaning of the Prophets
who apply their predictions to such a carnal Restoration of the jews as is now
expected. That mistake, as I believe, might be cured by observing, that
immediately after such Prophecies as foretold their temporal Restoration, the
coming of Christ's Kingdom is frequently presaged in the Texts following in the
same Chapters. If there seem to be any Prophecy which predicts such a
returning of the jews, as is now looked for after the Birth, Death, and
Ascension of our Redeemer; Let it be well considered, whether it means any more
then a returning to their Country by way of Preparation to their Spiritual
returning unto the Kingdom of their rejected King; or whether (as I rather
believe) the main intent of all the Prophets who Prophesied ought in relation
to what should be after Christ's Ascension (when the Partition Wall was broken
down, and Jews and Gentiles made one people) had not respect to Christ's Kingdom
only on Earth, as it should be manifested at his first coming, or at the
second, till the end of the World. Isaiah in his 60. Chapter and to the end of
his Prophecy; and Daniel in the last of his Prophecy; concur with St. John in
the last of his Revelation, in predicting the glory of that Spiritual Kingdom;
which, though it be upon Earth, will not be an Earthly Kingdom, nor so
inglorious as that will be at best, in respect thereof, which shall be confined
to Sion, and Jerusalem, in the Land of Canaan; For, When the new Heaven and the
new Earth shall be created, the old Name shall be left as a curse, and the
Servants of the Lord called by a new Name, Esa. 65. This, and other Prophesies
concerning Christ's Kingdom to come upon Earth, are (as I understand him) well
considered, by my good friend, Mr. T. M. of W. Senior, in a Tract of his which
I have lately seen, with respect to the Jews temporary condition and Country,
so far forth as they seem to concern them by way of preparation to what shall
be hereafter: For, their ancient Country, being (as I think) a part of that
Garden which God planted Eastward in Eden, shall no doubt, when Christ's Kingdom
more visibly appears, have many Prophesies there locally, and literally, as
well as spiritually fulfilled; and my intent is not to contradict what other
men believe of that Mystery, but, rather to prevent such mistakes as may be
repugnant to the Essentiality thereof. When I contemplate the said Kingdom of
Christ, and his personal Reign here on Earth, looking backward, and forward,
upon that Experimental knowledge of good and evil, which Mankind is likely to
acquire, in the Six days of a 1000 Years apiece; and the Knowledge also, which
will be gotten in that seventh part of time wherein Christ shall come, both to
the full Illustration, and destruction of all that is Evil, and to the plenary
Demonstration and Perfection of all that is Good, for restoring the Saints who
shall live and reign with him, to that Paradisical Estate, out of which our
first Parents were excluded: When (I say) I contemplate this, I have such a
strong desire to express what I glimmeringly apprehend of it, that, being
unable to perform it, it makes me so sick and faint in Body and Spirit, when I
attempt it, that I am forced to desist from those contemplatings to recover
strength, lest distracted by the variety of Notions; I might in that weakness,
either extend my expressions to more then this Generation can yet bear; or, to
that which may be misapprehended; being forced to cry out in my heart with St.
Paul: Oh the depth of the riches both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God! How
unsearchable are his Judgments! And his Ways past finding out!

12. I set no bounds to Gods Mercy, nor am hopeless of the extent thereof to
any whilst they are in the flesh, until they have utterly excluded themselves
by wilful malicious and final obstinacy, and who they are I cannot certainly
know; Therefore, neither judge peremptorily of any, or neglect to pray for
them: No not to pray for the persons of Antichristian Prelates, who have
perverted the true intent of Evangelical Episcopacy, which I reverence: For, I
believe it possible for some of them to repent and be saved, though they are
the worst of all men who seem to be Members of Christ's Visible Church: Nor am I
incredulous that there are, were, and shall be, in every Age, a Remnant of
those called Jews (though the worst of all men without the Visible Church)
preserved according to the Election of God, and brought into Christ's Fold: But,
whether there shall be such an Universal return as some think, I am yet
doubtful, it being nothing pertinent to my personal saving Faith. For, though
it was expedient (as David Prophetically prayed in the 59 Psalm) that they
should be scattered and not utterly rooted out, to preserve Gods people mindful
both of his Mercy and Severity; yet by the words of Christ to the Pharisees,
and chief Priests (the Representatives of that Nation) John 7. 34. Ye shall
seek me and not find me, and where I am there ye shall not come (as also by
what David presaged of their distempered composure when they should make show
of preparing to a Return in the Evening of the World) we may have cause to be
jealous that the preparations now rumoured, are but a Preludium to some design
of the Devil, to stir up and bring together GOG and MAGOG, all open and secret
Enemies of Christ's Kingdom, to prosecute their last Attempt against it; For, I
hear not of, any change, in those Jews or Israelites, from their Apostacies and
Malicious Blasphemies; but only, a seeking after their old earthly Inheritance,
and things merely pertinent to this life; whereof there is no promise to them
who first seek not the Kingdom of Heaven. We are not, as some imagine, to
depend on the Jews Universal calling, as if the Kingdom of Christ should not be
completed until then: For, our dependancy is not grounded upon what they or
any other shall do. We were of those Nations, who sat heretofore in darkness,
and in the shadows of Death; but have now a Light shining upon us to the
increase and confirmation of our Joy. A Son is born unto us, upon whose
shoulder the Government is imposed: his Name is Wonderful, Councellor, the
Mighty GOD, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace, of whose Government
there shall be no end. The Kingdom of David is already settled upon him, and the
Jews do seek in vain to bring to pass what they hope for, as appears, Isa. 9.
who affirms they should say in the pride of their hearts, The Bricks are fallen
down, but we will build it with hewn stones; But, They turn not, says he, to
him who smote them, nor seek the Lord of Hosts; and for that cause, says the
same Prophet, They shall be cut off, head and tail, root and branch, in one
day, even their Leaders, and they that led them. Moreover he presaged what
horrid confusions should come upon them; and that GODS hand after several
visitations, should be still stretched out against them; That, but a Remnant of
them should return, though they were as numerous as the Sea-sands; and that a
passege should be made for that Remnant as miraculous as when they came out of
Egypt, Isa. the 9, 10, and 11. Chapters. These Prophecies considered with what
ye find, Isa. 75. and in other Scriptures, incline me to believe that
whatsoever is predicted concerning the Israel of God, after the Ascension of
Christ, relates not singly to Jews or Gentiles, but to both as they are united
and made one People in him; and I leave them who think otherwise to their own
Judgment, till they see cause to the contrary, as freely as I desire upon the
same terms to enjoy my own; For, be it still REMEMBERED, that this is
cautionarily intended, without purposing, ought in opposition to what is
believed by others upon better information then I have yet had.

13. I will a little more enlarge my self as touching those Prophecies relating
to the Jews: for when my heart inclines me to express what I think pertinent to
Gods Glory in my Generation, it will be required at my hands if I neglect it,
though my Cautions and Remembrances be little regarded. The foresaid Rumor
seems but a trifling occasion, yet, that impression which I perceive it has
upon many, and the event which it may have if there be any truth in it, makes
that very considerable which I offer to be heeded. He, whom we believe to be
the Antichrist, hoping to divert us from taking him to be that Mystical man,
has a long time pretended, and caused it to be written and preached that
Antichrist must be a Jew; And now, perhaps, the Devil (who first laid the
foundation of his kingdom, and mystery of Iniquity) is hatching somewhat to
improve that Fallacy by a Jewish design, and by cherishing an Opinion that the
Jews are to have their Temporary Kingdom established again in the Land of
Canaan; And many Prophecies (which I am persuaded never intended it) are
interpreted to that purpose, by some who would not have made such
interpretations, if they had heeded what evil consequences it may produce. Let
therefore my Caveats be well heeded (though I am worth little regard) lest we
concurring with the Jews, in misunderstanding their Prophets, invalid the
Interpretations which the Apostles and all Orthodox Primitive Christians, made
of those Predictions which foretold the spiritual Kingdom of Christ; and
strengthen the Jews in their Judaism and infidelity, to the destroying also of
our saving Faith. For, if we grant those Scriptures ought so to be interpreted
as they are by some among us; then, the Jews will affirm that those Scriptures
also, ought so to be understood whereby we are confirmed in believing the true
Messiah is come: Yea, this they will then say, notwithstanding all we shall
alledg to the contrary, if we vary from that sense in which they were applied
by Christ and his Apostles; and we shall thereby shake the Foundation of
Christianity, in regard those Prophecies now interpreted to signify the Jews
recovering a Temporal Kingdom, after the Ascension of Christ, are some of those
Prophecies upon which our Belief is grounded. Much is expressed of GODS love
and respect to Jerusalem and Sion, in Palestine; and no doubt, they being the
Seats of Gods onward worship, and the most eminent Places of their Habitation,
who were then his chosen people, he had respect unto them for their sakes, and
loved them more then all the dwellings of Jacob. But, after the Messiah was
rejected and by them crucified, it were a very low and mis-beseeming Opinion of
GODS love and regard, to imagine he had any respect thereunto, after he had
made it a Desolate and Ruinous heap. For my part, I do not believe that he has
any more regard of that City and Hill, then of our City of London, and
Tower Hill annexed; or that the glorious things, which were to be fulfilled
after Christ's Incarnation and Ascension, and predicted by the Prophets, had
relation any otherwise then to the Spiritual Sion, and that Jerusalem, which is
to descend from Heaven. It is said, Isa. 60. 19, 20. (to the Church of Christ
Typified by Sion) The Sun shall be no more thy Light by day, neither for
brightness shall the Moon give Light unto thee; The Sun shall no more go down,
neither shall the Moon withdraw her Light, for the Lord shall be thine
everlasting Light: To the same effect, it is said thus, Rev. 21. of the New
Jerusalem, The City had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine in it,
for the glory of God does enlighten it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof. This
is not likely to intend that Earthly Sion and Jerusalem, which is in Palestine,
where there will be need of the Sun and Moon, whilst they are in Heaven, even
in a literal sense, in which sense, that Scripture had no relation to the Jews;
nor many other things which were predicted by the same Prophet, but in a
Mystical sense only, With reference to Jews and Gentiles united in the Kingdom
of Christ, after the Partition Wall was broken down; according to that
interpretation which I believe our Savior made of them when he opened the Book
of Isaiahs Prophecy, and finding these words, Isa. 61. 1. The Spirit of the
Lord is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me to Preach good tidings unto
the meek, he has sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim, liberty
to the Captives, and opening of the Prison to them that are bound, etc. And a
little after it is said, They shall build the old Wastes, they shall raise up
the former Desolations, and they shall repair the wast Cities, the Desolation
of many generations, etc. And after all this, he added, that, this Prophecy,
was that day fulfilled in their sight; and if then fulfilled, there is not such
a fulfilling to come as is expected in a Carnal mode; But, a completing of
that Spiritual Kingdom which was then begun. Meditate seriously the Prophecies
of Isaiah, beginning at the 60 Chapter, to the last, and they will evidence
that though there be some hints particularly relating to the Kingdom and Nation
of the Jews, whilst they were under the Law, their principal intent, was the
Estate of Christ's Kingdom, both at his first coming, and afterward, until his
second coming to Reign more visibly upon Earth; and to demonstra^^^ unto his
Church, consisting both of Jews and Gentiles, made one Flock, what should
befall them by reason of their many prevarications after his first coming;
which have since that time, been equivalent to the Jewish Apostacies before,
and at his first Advent. For, I will be bold to tell this Generation, that the
Christians have followed the Jews since the coming of Christ, in all their
former Deviations, as, if they had taken them for their Pattern, yea, just as
they did from the day wherein Moses gave unto them the Law, until their Messiah
came: And if he come not again quickly, the Professors of the Gospel will be as
much corrupted as they, and fall by degrees into an Apastacy and Obduration
parallel to theirs; But, I hope God will prevent it, by making the Apostacies,
Impostures, and wickednesses of depraved Jews and Gentiles now called
Christians, to be at last as Advantageous to the Kingdom of Christ, as the
Perverseness of the Jews was to the Gentiles at his first coming. That which
first occasioned some (who seem to insist on it as an Article of our saving
Faith) to believe there will be such a Restoration of the Jews to their
Temporary Kingdom as is now expected, was the vain curiosity of those Christian
Doctors, who, to be reputed Learned in Rabbinical Mysteries followed the
Interpretations of the Jewish Rabbis, who lived since the Ascension; Some of
whose malicious falsehoods in perverting the Interpretations made by their
Rabbis before Christ's first coming, I long since discovered, in my Exposition
of the second Psalm; particular the falsehood of Rabbi Solomon, who in his
Exposition of that Psalm(written in a Language known then to few but
themselves) confessed it was by their Predecessors expounded literally of
Christ to come; But, then was, as he said, to be expounded literally of David,
to answer Heretics, meaning the Christians This Exposition of mine upon the
second Psalm, with nine other Psalms, was lost in Manuscript when my House was
plundered, not likely to be recovered. What might be said more to this purpose,
would fill a Volume by it self and take up more time then I can spare at
present, All therefore which I profess to believe touching the Calling and
Conversion of the Jews, is this; That as David says, In the Evening they shall
return, etc. Psalm. 59. That is, they having, notwithstanding the Preaching of
the Gospel, now almost 1700 years, run rambling and snarling like Dogs round
about the City in their impenitence, grumbling and unsatisfied, shall return in
the Evening of the world, in the beginning of that seventh day of a thousand
years, in which Christ's personal Reign is to begin; (at least so many of them
whose incredulity, as Paul's did, proceeded from ignorance only, and not from
malice) For, then he, who at his first coming said unto them who believed not,
Where I am, thither cannot you come, shall come again to them; and they seeing
him whom they crucified and pierced in his Glory shining round about them, as
Paul saw him at his Conversion, shall with hearty penitence mourn over him, as
one lementing for his only Son; and then shall the Joy of Jews and Gentiles,
and the Kingdom of their Christ begin to be at full upon earth, and be full in
perfection at the close of that day.

14. I have been so large in this seeming digression* because I fear there are
many Professors of Christ so weak and wavering, that if they should see a
temporal prevalency wrought out by the Jews, whilst they persevered in their
malicious Judaism, they would be more prone (as it seems intimated by one of
the Prophets) To take them by their garments, and say, We will go with you, and
take share with them in a such temporal King and Kingdom, as they look for;
rather then continue constant (in persecution) to him whom they have professed.
Pardon this fear, for, I have seen too many causes of it, as well in other
respects, as by the misapprehensions of some who transported beyond sobriety,
have raised preconjectures from the Rumors aforementioned, of accomplishing
that thereby, which they had formerly resolved within themselves, to be the
fore-determined Decree of God. For, they seem to believe that it will shortly
succeed in the mode by them fancied, and as they themselves wish it might be.
Indeed, If (as the Proverb is) whishes were Thrushes, we might all eat Birds:
But, I believe it will not so fall out. The digging for a Trumpet, in a great
Mountain, by the sound whereof (as the Report goes) the Nation must be gathered
together, may be a long work; and it is sufficient to discover that the whole
matter may be fabulous, on justly suspected so to be; or that (if it be not a
Jeer or a device to befool some) there is an Imposture as aforesaid hatching,
to a worse end. For, what usefulness is there of a Mat^rial Trumpet, dug out
of the Earth, to proclaim the approach of the Eternal King and his Kingdom; or
to call a Nation out of every nook in the wide world? Such whimsies I am not
taken withal, nor can believe the perfecting that Kingdom, which we look for
upon the earth, depends on such Absurdities, as are fancied by many, in other
modes. To gain credit to the aforesaid Rumor, it is written, that they who
call themselves Israelites have a wise and holy Prophet among them to be their
Conducter, by whom their Design is carried on; and some with us do suppose him
to be Elias, though Christ himself has told us he is come already: And some
other think him to be that beloved Disciple, mentioned in the 21 Chapter of St.
John's Gospel, where our Savior presaging in what mode Peter should suffer, and
he then asking, What that Disciple should do? was thus answered, If I will that
he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me: Whereupon some
inferred, that Disciple he should not die, though (as was then averred in the
words following) Christ said not so; nor (as I believe) intended it should be
so understood; yet, that interpretation is retained by some to this day, and
now (as I hear) made use of to countenance the forementioned Rumor, whereof; I
confess my self incredulous, for the reasons before expressed. Doubtless, when
such an occasion was given to have it explained, Christ would not have left
that ambiguous which was misunderstood; and so l believe of every mysterious
expression, which is necessary to be known by all men as pertinent to their
Salvation; unless it be to make us wary by what Spirit we interpret holy
Scripture; lest that which leads into all Truth may by our negligence, or vain
curiosity lead us into errors if misapprehended. If there be any point
mentioned in holy Scripture, relating to the Kingdom to come, which is topical,
or national, let them look to it whom it concerns; for, I conceive not that it
any otherwise concerns us, then as it shall have an Universal Locality upon
earth, without respect to any Nation or Place in particular, as appears to me,
by the words of our Savior to the woman of Samaria, John 4. 21, 22, 33. Woman,
said he, believe me, the hour comes when ye shall neither in this Mountain, or
in Jerusalem worship the Father. Ye worship ye know not what, etc. But, the
hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship in Spirit and
Truth, etc. Whence I collect, that if Place were not essential to the true
Worship of God, when Christ first came into the world, it will be less
essential thereunto at his second coming, or to have it limited to a narrower
extent, then to the whole Earth and all Nations.

15. I am not doubtful, but that in the last times there will be some
extraordinary and eminent transactions, (and some in the next year after this
1665. and during four or five and thirty years after 1666.) in relation to the
approaching Kingdom of Christ; and to those who have been so many Ages reputed
the Offspring of the Patriarks scattered throughout the world; and I believe
God will in his own time fulfill all his Judgments threatened for their
Apostacies and obstinacies; as also his gracious promises made unto their
Forefathers; but when that will be accomplised, that or in what manner will be
done, which is expected concerning the Jews, I leave it to Gods good pleasure,
and unto them, to search in what mode it will be, who think it concerns them,
more then I do; who am contented with those manifestations which I find in the
Word of God, not repugnant to each other, or above my understanding. There will
be such Signs, Wonders and Miracles, as have been foretold; as also,
extraordinary preparations by Divine Providence before Christ's second Advent,
which the Elect shall have sufficient means to know, and make such use of, as
most tends to Gods Glory, and to preserve them faithful to the end. Yet, unsafe
it may be, and an occasion of multiplying needless fears, and troubles upon our
selves, to make such Ideas of Christ's Kingdom and Reign upon Earth, or such
signs of its approach as are not plainly warranted by the Word of God, whose
hidden ways are past our finding out; and so much as is revealed will be
obscure to them, whose unsanctified hearts seek after it in curiosity only;
or, with more desire to find them suitable to their, own imaginations (that
they may have somewhat wherein to glory) then to make their ways conformable to
Gods. We are much taken with Novelties, especially when we our selves first
bring them to light; and very apt superstitiously to repute things holy or
unholy, which Have neither holiness or unholiness in them, except by our abuse.
We esteem some unholy which are sanctified; some other to be holy, which have
no holiness in them, but rather, that which is most contrary: For Example; That
is said to be the Holy Land, which has been during many Ages the most accursed
of all Lands: That to be a holy War, which was but a wicked-politick
divertisement of Antichrist to prevent the Interruption of his growing
Grandeur, by the Kings and Princes, whom by that Engine, he fooled into an
employment far from home. That is said to be a holy Nation, which has had a
long time, no more holiness in it, them Judas who betrayed Christ; They are
invocated and hallowed as Saints, and holy Martyrs, who were Traitors both to
God and men; and whilst they lived, not reputed so holy as some of their
Neighbors. And that Cross whereon our blessed Savior was crucified, is not
only called holy, but reputed worthy of Divine honor also, and has many
costly buildings dedicated thereunto, and the chips of it sold for precious
Relics at dear rates; though in truth it is not so holy as the Gallows at
Tibourn, because that was intended for the execution of Justice upon
Malefactors only, though perhaps innocents do suffer thereupon, otherwhile
while. We have many Inventions of our own. The Devil has so many deceitful
Wiles also, whereby to make false shows, that he is promoting, Gods Work with
him, in every Dispensation, that, I suspend my belief of new Apparitions, until
I am fully convinced by a better Light then mine own, bearing witness
thereunto; and therefore, have here thrust in such Caveats as came into my
heart, to be a memorandum both to my self and others; believing that,
whenever Gods Kingdom comes openly into the world, or invisibly into my heart
(where I feel it to be in some degree) it will always evidence it self without
delusion: For, it is the Kingdom of our heavenly Father, which we are taught to
petition for in this Prayer, and nothing like the Kingdoms of this world.

16. This is that Kingdom whose coming the Saints have long expected; and
though I mis-judge not of their so doing, who call it the Fifth-Monarchy, I
think that Title too mean an Appellative, in regard it is an Eternal Kingdom,
having no relation to Earthly Monarchies in respect of their precedence or
otherwise; but an Absolute Kingdom depending on it self and on him only, who
is the Supreme King thereof. And when it comes into the World, it will be
little available to those who shall not find it to be in some measure come (or
so coming) into their hearts, that they may be made one with it, and with the
King thereof, by Faith and Love. This is not a Kingdom like that of the
Nations* which the Israelites foolishly desired when GOD reigned over them; nor
is this King such a one as many other have as sottishly coveted, and when they
had him cried out to God to be delivered from him, because of those oppressions
and slavish burdens, which his ignorance, wilfulness, pride, luxury and
vanities brought on them; not considering, that their own base flatteries, and
the much wickedness which is in themselves, had perhaps occasioned those
defects and exorbitances, which were in him; nor heeding that they perpetuate a
reciprocal increase of destructive sins and mischiefs in and upon each other;
But, each Party so blames, and is so jealous of the other, without observing
what is amiss in it self, that neither take care of amendment; nor is so
diligent to get, and exercise the means of doing what is good, as to be Masters
of power enough to do what evil they list, and to whomsoever they please. With
this King and his Kingdom, it is not so; the Sovereign and Subjects thereof are
inseparably one in Love; the services to them belonging are perfect Freedom;
and they are Justice and Mercy in the abstract: the Kings of this world neither
love to hear of this Kingdom, nor believe it will ever come; yet they are often
in much fear of it, and for the most part enemies to them who profess the
belief and expectation thereof; yea, very jealous (how innocently soever they
behave themselves) that, under pretense of Devotion, they plot and prosecute
Designs to the subversion of their Dominions, or Royal Prerogatives. And, we
lately had experience that some consci entious persons may be deluded, and
misled to the destruction of their own persons, and other men's, (or of their
peace, at the least) by taking into their hands that Sword, which belongs not
to private men in that mode, as if they thought the coming of this Kingdom were
attainable as well by the activity of the Saints in Fighting, as by suffering,
patience and praying; whereas, they who are guided by sound and sober
Principles, do believe and wait for that which they call the Fifth-Monarchy, in
Gods own Way and Time, according to his own good pleasure, and with that
patience which becomes Saints, without presuming peremptorily, to determine in
what manner CHRIST shall appear and Reign upon the Earth, otherwise then is
plainly revealed in the holy Scriptures; and contenting themselves with such
glimmerings thereof in mysterious Figures, as may be sufficient to raise
contemplative Souls, above that which they hear and see; For, these know that
their frail, narrow, earthen Vessels are not able to comprehend the Glory of it
at full. They who have not attained to this moderation and prudence, do
sometimes give just occasion of offense or suspicion to the Civil Powers, as
aforesaid, by misunderstanding holy Scriptures and Prophecies, concerning the
Kingdom here prayed for, supposing it is to be conquered by the temporal Sword
in their hands; and that the binding of Kings in Chains, and Princes in fetters
of Iron, with such like expressions, are to be understood in a gross literal
sense; whereas, if the temporal Sword, shall be any way useful toward
introducing of this Kingdom, it will be but preparatorily only, in the hands
of the Enemies thereof to do execution upon each other, according to that
Prophecy of Haggai, Their Riders shall come down, every one by the Sword of
his brother, Hag. 2. 22.

17. The Weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but spiritual; and the little
heed taken thereof, inclines me often to mention it: For, it is the two-edged
sword of the Word and Spirit proceeding out of his Mouth, whom John, Rev. 1.
16. saw standing in the midst between the seven Golden Candlesticks, which must
overthrow the strong holds of Antichrist, and his confederates, obstructing the
Advent of this Kingdom; toward the exaltation whereof, our Savior might have
obtained when he was upon the Earth, a more powerful assistance then that Sword
(had he so pleased) by praying for it to his Father, even more then twelve
Legions of Angels. But, so far was he from approving the use of Temporal
Swords, or outward violence to propagate his Kingdom, that when a Disciple of
his drew such a Sword in defense of his person being betrayed (and thereby cut
off the ear of Malchus, a confederate in the Treason) he healed the wound,
commanding the Sword to be put up, and said; that Whosoever made use of the
Sword (to the purpose aforesaid, as I conceive) should perish by the Sword.
This we have seen fulfilled upon some, who seemed zealous of Christ's Kingdom;
and I believe it has often heretofore, and may hereafter be fulfilled upon
many to their destruction in the flesh, to whose souls GOD will be merciful, if
their zeal were not a cloak for secret pride and malice unrepented of. For, God
otherwhile permits, even some who are true Children, and Subjects to his
Kingdom, to be transported into such Extravagancies as their natural corruption
inclines them unto, and to be thereby liable to open sufferings in the flesh;
and to be nevertheless partakers in secret of his Everlasting Mercy; partly,
to make other Children of the Kingdom, the more watchful and careful to examine
by what spirit they are moved; and partly (as I conceive) to bring somewhat
pertinent to their considerations also, who are as over-zealons another way, in
seeking more to establish their own Kingdoms then Christ's.

18. This last Clause, I have inserted, to prevent such mistakes as may
occasion the giving just offense, or of infringing the Civil peace, or of
scandalizing our Christian Profession, by imprudent Designs or uncharitable
Actings; and I hope it will have some good and seasonable effects: For, the
Spiritual Adversary is cunning, and so well knows how to work upon our
Melancholy Distempers, that, even in those things whereof our Natural senses
are most capable, we may be much deluded, as by many Experiments may be
Demonstrated. (For example) A Divine Preaching in a Cathedral Church, one of
the Auditorie suddenly cried out, as if he had been afrighted with fire,
whereupon a great part of the Assembly (they themselves not knowing why)
apprehending the Church to be on fire, suddenly and hastily tumbled out of
their seats one over another to get out of the doors, and so obstructed the
passage, that some were trodden under foot, and some stifled in the throng; in
which fright, one thought he saw the fire, another that he heard it crackle,
another, that he felt the molten Lead drop upon him, with such like
misapprehensions, whereof there was no cause at all by fire or otherwise.
Likewise, an Acquaintance of mine being at Sea, (where a supposition in the
night, that the Ship had sprung a leak, put them into a general pannick fright)
he sitting in his Cabin, fancied that he felt the cold water come up to his
feet, then to his knees, soon after to his belly; which (as it usually fates
with them who seldom go into cold water) made him pant, and so think his breath
taken away thereby, that, he should immediately expire his soul; Yet, there was
no water entered into the Ship. This he told me in such a manner, as if he had
been then sensible of that distemper by his misapprehension. Much more
therefore, may our Fancies delude us by Spiritual misapprehensions, if we be
not watie of surprises; especially when such. imaginary Objects, and false
Representations of our frail deluded senses are heightened by that which is
cunningly suggested by the Devil. Perhaps, it will be thought by some, that in
this and some other Expressions, I ramble from the matter in hand: But be it
known, that the way of a Contemplative Soul, being like that of an Eagles in
the Air, (which is the Hieroglyphick thereof) tends directly toward what it
seeks, though it appears not so to the beholders; and to what quarter soever it
flies, minds that Carkas which is the true nourishment thereof.

19. Having declared what Kingdom that is which we pray for, I will now show
unto whom it belongs, which is evidenced by this pronoun THY. It may be
collected from what I have already expressed: Yet, that whereunto my Meditation
thereupon leads me, will not be useless. The word THY, implies, that this
Kingdom is our Fathers to whom we pray: Not a Kingdom to be possessed by a
single Person whom we know not, who perhaps may be a Stranger and a Tyrant, or
such a one who will suppose (as most earthly Kings do) that it was conferred
upon him, merely for his own sake, without respect to the welfare of the people
under his Jurisdiction; as if the Commonalty of all Nations had been born to no
other purpose, but to be inslaved to their Will, or to be Servants at best, to
advance their Pomp, and to be serviceable to their Lusts. But, this is not to
be feared, when this Kingdom shall come. We know whose the Kingdom is, and who
shall Reign over it. It is our Fathers Kingdom, and that assures us (as is
before hinted) that in praying for it, we petition for that which tends not
only to our Fathers Honor, but to our own Preferment also. We have no
possibility to be totally freed from the Tyrannies of Temporary Governments and
Governors, but by the coming of this Kingdom; For neither Democracy, nor
Aristocracy, nor a Monarchy regulated, nor any other humane Form of Government,
how often soever we change Persons, is free from corruptions, or the increase
of them likely to have a stop, until this Kingdom comes, which (were it but in
respect of that alone) will make us partakers of the greatest Temporal Mercy
that may be enjoyed upon the Earth next to our deliverance from Sin: For, so
intolerable are the Deficiencies and Oppressions of Supreme Governors,
throughout most Kingdoms of the World, in relation both to Temporal and
Spiritual Interests, that some Nations care not who comes to Reign over them,
so they may be delivered from their present Tax-masters; Yea, are contented to
be invaded by Strangers, to be beaten by their Enemies, and to adventure
whatsoever they will impose upon them, because, they believe it cannot be worse
with them then it is, or probably will be; though they have had, long time,
experience, that, Seldom comes a better. This sad condition, the Subjects of
this expected Kingdom shall be delivered from, when it comes. Our Father has
made us free Denizens thereof; Coheirs with his Eternal Son, and given us
Thrones with Him, by an unquestionable, unrepealable Decree, written and signed
with the precious Blood of our Eldest Brother, whose Love did voluntarily
purchase it for us at that dear Rate. It cannot be expressed in words, to set
forth how much he tendered our Welfare, in prescribing this Prayer; or how
strongly it obliges us to make a thankful and right use of it.

20. Thy Kingdom COME. The last word in this Petition is not so to be so
understood in the Future Tense, as if the Kingdom thereby prayed for, had not a
being heretofore, and at this present upon Earth; For, it is in part already
Demonstrated to be otherwise. All therefore, which will be further necessary to
be insisted upon to that purpose, resulting from this word COME; is to mind us,
that this Kingdom, is not yet so perfectly manifested as it shall be when that
long Day is begun, in which the great Assize will be holden, wherein the King
of this Kingdom shall come to Judge the quick and the dead. I do already
contemplatively behold it approaching by the Eye of my Soul; But, that Eye is
so dim, and my Body so frail, that my Heart is unable to comprehend (much less
my Tongue or Pen to express) that little which I conceive thereof: But, of that
unutterable mystery, I can truly say this, that, whosoever endeavors to
declare in what manner Christ shall come and Reign upon Earth, undertakes a
work like his, who strives to put the whole Ocean into a Nut-shel, and that, if
the glory of this Kingdom were comprehensible; by us, in this estate wherein we
now are, it would not be answerable to the expectation I have of it: For the
most excellent External things which we can either enjoy or know in the flesh,
are insufficient to illustrate the perfection of it by way of allusion; For,
the clearest Notions of such spiritual Objects, which we may attain unto, will
be dissatisfactory to the Soul until it is in a glorified Body. Nevertheless,
we may be made so apprehensive by Grace and Faith of the Kingdom to come, that,
we may by Patience, Meekness, Humility and Love, wait contentedly for what is
promised; and be preserved in a constant expectation thereof until it comes;
whatsoever Clouds are evaporated from Humane Ignorance; and whatsoever Mists
may be raised by the Devil, to make us doubtful thereof: And this we are to
Communicate to each other, so far forth as it is revealed by the Word and
Spirit of God, to confirm the belief and expectation of this Kingdom: For,
though they were reputed Heretics termed Millenaries, who professed the
personal Reign of Christ upon Earth, and that (according to St. John) Rev. 20.
4. the Saints should Reign with Christ a 1000 Years: Yet, after the Testimony
of the two Witnesses was finished; which (as I conceive) was when the two
Testaments were completed, with a Malediction upon them, who should take from,
or add ought thereunto, Rev. 21. 18, 19. that Opinion was received for Orthodox
by the Primitive Christians, till the Beast, which rose out of the bottomless
pit, made war against them, and slew them. For, many of the eminent Doctors and
Martyrs in the first Ages were of that Judgment (to wit) Ireneus, Justine
Martyr, Tertullian, Origin, Cyprian, and diverse other Christians, both Learned
and Unlearned. And, I find by examining it, that most Heresies sprung from real
Divine Truths, misunderstood by humane Ignorance and rashness; Such Mysteries,
being like the most excellent strains of Music in this respect, that, as when
the Voice or a String, is under or overmuch strained, though but a little, it
makes a harsh discord; So, a little varying from the Truth, makes a damnable
error. Now, perhaps, that which I have here casually inserted concerning the
two Witnesses, being my private Judgment, wherein I know no Ancient or Modern
Interpreter concurring, may seem a presumption. But, I have given such Reasons
of what I believe concerning them, in a Tract entitled Parallelogrammaton,
whereof part was imprinted when I was close Prisoner in the Tower, and the rest
taken out of my Chamber by the Gentleman Jailer, there (amounting to almost a
100. pages) that, I conceive it will make it more probable that those Witnesses
are both slain and risen again, then any thing yet alleged to the contrary;
and therefore if those papers be not freely restored, I will revive them, God
vouchsafing me time and enablement. And, if what I have thereby, and hereby
expressed concerning the said two Witnesses, and the Nation of the Jews, with
what might be added, were well considered, it would not (as I believe) be so
generally believed as it is, that, Christ's coming personally into his Kingdom
upon Earth, is deferred, either because the Jews are not yet called, or the
Witnesses not yet slain and raised up again.

21. That, there is such a Mystery to be manifested as the Kingdom to come,
there need to be no better evidence thereof, then the Witness which the Spirit
of God bears unto it in our hearts, by concurring with that rational faculty
in our Souls, which distinguishes us from brutish Animals. Common Reason
dictates, that whatsoever a friend of whose true worth we have had long
experience in all changes, shall warrant us to ask in his Name of another
person, in whom he has an undoubted interest, we may confidently petition for
it; and it were a great injury done to his Love and Dignity, if we should
suspect he did advise to ask for that which was not grantable, or unlikely to
be obtained. The same Reason tells us, that if a gracious earthly Prince, has
been openly Scorned, Dishonored, Reviled, Betrayed, and every way inhumanely
abused; It is just he should in the same place, be as openly and as much as is
possible vindicated, and glorified, to the shame of his malicious impenitent
Enemies: How much more just then is it, that the Eternal Son of God, Lord of
lords, and King of kings, should be glorified in his own Kingdom upon Earth, in
the fight and presence of his Saints, Angels, and all those by whom he was
causlesly dishonored, betrayed, and most cruelly and ingratefully recompensed
with evil for good; with hatred for Love, and with all manner of Indignities,
for incomparable well deservings? If this be just with men, shall the righteous
Judge and King of Heaven and Earth do less Justice on the behalf of his only
Son? If herein we distrust not our own Reason, we should less suspect it, when
we have a Warrant above Reason to ascertain it, which we likewise have out of
the Word of God. As for the witness, which some conceive, the Spirit of God,
bears to the Light which is within them by extraordinary Revelations, I must
leave it to the soul and conscience of every individual man to try and examine
them, as they are enabled: For, that cannot be known or judged of by any, but
by them to whom they are revealed, and by that Spirit which reveals them, if
they proceed from God. Where he speaks not, it will be in vain for any other
to speak; and until the Revelation of that aforementioned, shall in some
measure come into men's hearts; We do but cast pearls to Swine, and shall be in
danger to be torn by them, or else reputed madmen and Phaenaticks, babbling we
know not what. This also is to be considered, that, though the perfect
manifestation of this Kingdom be not come down Universally upon earth; yet it
is come, or shall come in a degree toward perfection, first or last,
explicitly or implicitly, into all to whom that Kingdom belongs, before they
depart out of this life. He that shall come will come, and not tarry beyond his
time (blessed be his Name) and he has given us sufficient earnests thereof.

22. It is said, Acts 1. 11. Ye men of Galilee, Why stand ye gazing up into
heaven? This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in
like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. There is also a cloud of other
Testimonies bearing witness to this Kingdom, particularly in the last Chapter
of Daniel, in the three last Chapters of the Apocalypse, in the twentieth of
Matthew, in the Psalms, and in well-nigh all the Prophets, which I cannot now
enumerate or insist upon, left I should interrupt or distract the Meditations
of my soul, by Withdrawing my heart from those inflowings which now press upon
it; and perhaps consume that little time which I have to finish what I have
begun. In those Scriptures, that which concerns this Kingdom and the King
thereof; the manner of their approach, the signs fore-shewing it; the effects
of it, and many particulars and circumstances pertinent to those Mysteries,
assisting us to obtain cognizance of them so far forth as will be needful, both
by literal and allegorical expressions, are sufficient to evidence their
essentiality to all those who observe and consider them with diligence and
meekness to the right end. Yea, it will resolve their scruples, whom an
overcurious prying into the manner of Christ's future personality upon the
earth, have made doubtful what to believe, if they shall in humility well
consider the difference which is between Spiritual and Natural Bodies, or of
what our future change will make us capable, when that time comes. We have a
dim glimmering demonstration thereof, helping us to discern much beyond and
above our Natural expectations, by the transfigurations of our Savior upon a
Mountain in the sight of Peter, John and James, to whom Moses and Elias
appeared to be talking with their Master, For, though the Natural state wherein
his Disciples then were, was not fully capable of that Mystery, which they
heard and saw, they perceived enough to make them very well pleased with what
they apprehended, as appeared by their words. And, if we had no other Argument
whereby we may be ascertained that there will be such a Kingdom upon earth,
then the Petition next following. Thy will be done in earth as it in heaven, it
will sustice, for it is impossible Gods will should be so done upon earth,
unless Christ's Kingdom should come hither as we believe; nor would Christ have
taught us to pray for that which should never be, or impossible to be performed.

23. The Administration of this Kingdom upon earth, was always in part visible
somewhere, and to some, ever since the time of Christ's Ascension. And though it
was much obscured soon after, when the mystery of iniquity began to work; and
more when it was at highest; yet, even then it was very powerful by secret
operations, through the Administration of the Holy Ghost, the third Person in
Trinity, and shall be, until the King of that Kingdom appears again to
personate his distinct Office, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, who have,
always an intrinsecal cooperation with him. What I further apprehend
concerning their joynt-acting in, and concerning this Kingdom; I will offer to
consideration, though such speculations may perhaps appear Novelties: For,
sometimes great Fires are kindled by little obscured sparks, and my Rush-candle
may perhaps occasion the enlightening of many Torches hereafter, when my snuff
is burnt out. There is an Interweaving of many dark expressions in the
Apoculypse of St. John concerning this and other sublime Mysteries, to him
delivered; wherein, things preceding have relation to things following; and
some things following to those which precede, by way of supplement, as I
conceive; and some also having reference, both to what was precedent and
subsequent. Thus, under correction, I apprehend; and that, among such, the
binding of Satan for a thousand years, is one; having respect as well to the
restraining of him, from setting up his Mystery of Iniquity until the LET
should be taken away (which was before the Bottomless Pit was opened) as a
relation unto the time wherein he should be restrained a thousand years from
deceiving the Nations, after the BEAST, the false Prophet, and the whole
Mystery of Antichristianism should be destroyed, by the coming of Christ to
personate his Kingship upon earth: For, it was a thousand years after our
Saviors Ascension, and after the Roman Empire was at highest (and began to
decline) before the Beast which arose out of it could ascend to his height;
which consumed all the number of years allotted to that Empire, until the Beast
last mentioned, arose. This time was enigmatically presignified by M. the first
and greatest Numeral belonging to that Empire; the remainder of their Numerals,
to wit, DCLXVI presaged the time allotted to the second Beast (the last Relick
of that Monarchy) mystically represented, by that part of Daniel's Image, which
was composed of Iron and Clay. For, though I must confess I have no Precedent
for what I declare my Judgment to be, nor any other warrant but what has been
spoken to my own heart in private; I do conceive (which I have heretofore
published effect upon several occasions) that God, though it seems they took no
notice of it, gave that Empire a Mysterious hint, in their own Numerals, how
long it should last after it was at highest, both in the main of its first
Institution, and in that which should arise out of it, until the total
extirpation thereof branch and root. All the said Numerals joined together in
order, beginning at the greatest and ending at the least, being these,
M.D.C.L.X.V. and I, make one thousand six hundred sixty six. The thousand years
were consumed before the second Beast which is the Mystery of Iniquity, was
completed, and then that usurped the whole power of his Predecessor; and the
remaining Numerals make up DCLXVI, which is the number of a Man: to wit, the
Mystical man of sin; and will be the whole time limited, as I conceive, for his
wicked Reign, after he came to his highest exaltation; and, as I take it, we
are to begin to reckon this double number, from Christ's death and passion or
Ascension, not from his Birth; because the Roman Empire was not at his highest
till then; and declined not until it had Crucified the Lord of Life, And if so,
we may guess within a short time, how long that Mystery may continue, if we
knew certainly how many years Christ lived upon the earth; and if Chronologers
have rightly computed preceding times, from his Birth till this year 1665, and
that time as I have already said, may be about four or five and thirty years
yet to come. I will not so absolutely determine it, as once heretofore I did
(being, a little-over heated with Zeal) upon occasion given to treat of that
time: For, Christ having intimated that a complete certainty of it, is not
revealed to any man in the flesh, I wave that peremptory expression, though I
still believe it will be about that time; and perhaps, God sometimes permits
such casual slips (when they are not purposed) to keep his Children quiet, when
they desire things before they can be had, as we do our Children by suffering
them to please themselves with uncertain harmless hopes. When the number of the
Beast is finished, I do believe, there will be a space of time, in which that
which is truly Good shall be as well made known, at Evil has now been almost
six thousand years, and that the time thereto allotted is that seventh
Mysterious Day, or Sabbath which the Lord our GOd hallowed when he had finished
his six days works; and that the Jewish, sabbaths of days and years, were but
Types of the great sabbath separated from the other six parts of time, and
sanctified by GOD for himself and his chosen people to rest; in; and is called
a Day by him, with whom A thousand years is but as yesterday; it being usual in
holy scripture, to signify many years and times consisting of many ages, by
the denomination of a day, or days; as in Daniel, a time of many Generations,
then to come, by 1335 days, Dan. 12. 12. and in the Revelation, 11, by 1260
days; and in the same Chapter, by three day and a, half; and it signifies the
whole time of Christ's Kingdom upon earth, in that place where it is said,
Abraham desired to see his day, and saw it; For, he fore saw it by Faith.

24. Six days of a thousand years apiece (as I conceive) was allotted for the
men of this World, to prosecute, therein, those works which they thought they
had to do; and were allotted both for their Probation, and to acquit (as
aforesaid) that experimental knowledge which was desired by our First-parents.
And in that space of time, both good and evil men, who were Vicegerents or
Subjects, either of the Kingdom of God, or of the Prince of this, world, were
permitted to be active for their several Interests, according to their,
distinct inclinations, and to pursue them so far forth, as that good or evel
which was in them would extend. But, neither the Righteousness, which was in
the best, is sufficient in it self to perfect their desired Kingdom, nor the
wickedness which is in the worst, enongh to establish their Dominion; because
the restraining power of him, who is the Supreme Governor of all things, would
not permit the Adversaries of his Kingdom to be so wicked as they would have
been in acting destructively thereunto, though the wickedness of their Will,
wanted nothing to complete of demonstrate their personal untighteousness, of
that perfection of Evil which was in them. But, when the great Sabbaths of
years is come, in which the supreme Kings of both, are to manifest and exercise
their Powers, in another mode then heretofore, (or at this present) to wit,
during the last thousand years or seventh part of time, it will then evidently
and universally appear whether of the two is most powerful; and that neither
the Evil which is it the worst men, or the Good which is in the best men, could
thitherto, or shall at that day do any works of their own, which they think
they had to do, that will be prevalent to those evili or good ends which they
proposed to establish their respect (...) Kingdoms: For, then will be the Day
of his Power whose Kingdom was lirerally prophesied of in the 110 Psalm: and
the Will of his willing ones be accepted instead of working. Their King alone
be the able to conquen all his Adversaries, letting loose the Devil to use the
utmost of his Usurped power, will break the Head of Malignity, together with
all the Kings of the opposing Kingdoms; and then his Subjects the Spiritual
seed of the true Abel and Abraham by Faith, (who for the most part of the
former six thousand years, have been subjected in their temporary concernments
to Cain and his Successors, and ever since his time been persecuted in relation
to their worship of God and their King) shall be totally set at liberty for
ever; and rest and Reign with him in that Kingdom, judging those Kings and
Nations by whose Tyranny they were oppressed; and against whom the Supream-Judg
of that Kingdom which they despised, and we pray for, shall pronounce this
sentence of Condemnation, Depart ye cursed into everlasting fire.

25. But though we believe there is such a Kingdom to come; shall fully know
the nature of it, whose it is, what advantages we may have by it, which are
innumerable, (and intimated in this Evangelical promise, See first the
Kingdom of God, and all other things shall be Ministered unto you) if we do our
formally seek it, for carnal ends only, it will nothing avail us, when it comes
openly into the Earth, until it comes into our hearts also. A Dominiou, is
there to be exercised, and it is the first place into which the Kingdom of
Heaven enters upon Earth. Every Saint has a Kingship, there to be managed,
whereby he must have a Probation, and be prepated for a Throne, in that which
will Universally appear; that will be performed; by cherishing those Vir^^^^
which may make his Microcosme, or little World, a true Province of that large,
Kingdom expected; and by subjecting to Reason, and to the Evangelical Laws, all
those natural Desires, Passions, and Affections, which have been Rebellious and
Repugnant to the Purity and Justice thereof, subduing, and keeping them under,
by a spiritual Militia. We ought therefore, to endeavor it diligently, and to
take heed that we let not, in the kingdom of the Devil instead of Christ's, or,
admit into us the Kingdoms of this world, For, most men are deluded with false
appearances in this case, whereof I have had had experiments a long time in
relation to my self; and, if I shall be credited, may say much to prevent those
fallacies in others. Hear then with seriousness, what I shall now express to
that purpose. I will begin with some of those deceivable Marks whereby very
many think they are made Children of God and Inheriters of his Heavenly
Kingdom, before they have any evidences thereof, but such as these ensuing;
whose invalidity let them consider. They had an Initiation into the Kingdom, by
being Baptized with water in the Name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost,
and had Godfathers and Godmothers, who, for obtaining that Privilege,
promised many things in their Names to be performed on their behalf: But, so
were many thousands, who being heedless of such promises, seem by their Lives
and Conversations, to be Children of the Devil, and belonging to this kingdom.
They have been outwardly partakers of the Lords Table; so was Judas, by what
seems a probability thereof, as well as the rest of the Apostles, yet, we know
he was reprobated. They have done Miracles; so did Simon Magus, Jannes,
Jambres, and others, yet were Impostors. They have caft out Devils in Christ's
Name; so did some, to whom he will say I know ye not. They have Prophesied
concerning him; so did Balaam and Caiaphas. They have builded goodly Temples;
so did Herod, whose like was not in the world, yet he was a Tyrant, and
murdered the innocent Children and John the Baptist. They have maintained many
such Priests and Prophets as they affected; so did Jezabel, yet was a Strumpet
and became Dogs meat. They were frequent hearers of them who preached the
Gospel; so are many who are no Doers of what they hear: and some, who came but
to entrap the Ministers of God, as others did to ensnare Christ; or else, came
to see and be seen, or more to be reputed Religious then with: sincere
Devotion. They have been Preachers of the Gospel, and Assertors of the Truth;
so have not a few been, who held and professed it in unrighteousness, or
preached rather to uphold contention, then to edify their hearers; and who,
through neglect of endeavoring mortification in themselves, have been
Reprobates; when they preached Salvation to others. They have fasted much,
given Alms, and said many long Prayers; so do Hypocrites, and so did the
hypocritical Scribes and Pharisees, often devouring Widows houses under those
pretenses. They have undergone severe penances, and grievously afflicted
themselves; so did the Priests of Baal heretofore, and so do many superstitious
Romanists, and others at this day. They have been sufferers; so have
Malefactors been, Innocent Heathens; and in finite numbers, who probably (...)
evidence within themselves, or sense of the Kingdom we pray for. Other
suchlike Marks I could enumerate wherewith multitudes are deluded* We must
therefore find out better Marks to ascertain us, That the Kingdom of God is
within us; and these that follow will also be such demonstrations thereof, as
if we be not Traitors to our selves, may make it unquestionably known to be
within us.

26. If the Kingdom of Christ be within us, we shall feel, that we love him who
is King thereof with all our hearts; yea, more then our selves; we shall be
obedient to all his Commands and Laws to our utmost power; Zealous of his
Honor, and of magnifying his Name, and maintaining all the Prerogatives of his
Kingdom, even to the loss of our lives, if need be, and sorry when we fail
therein, through infirmity: we shall love our selves no more, then to make it a
true Rule whereby to measure out the love we owe unto our Neighbors and
Brethren: We shall always have as well a charitable Love for our Enemies, as
an affectionate love for our Relations; and square out all Actions by the
Evangelical Law of that Kingdom. We shall do good for evil; bless them that
curse us; pray for them, who persecute us; forgive, as we would be forgiven; be
merciful to all Gods creatures, according to their kinds; use them with
sobriety and thankfulness; and be afflicted for it in our hearts, when we are
knowingly, or ignorantly defective in these of any other duties, as soon as we
have cognizance thereof, or suspect our selves to have been any way faulty: We
shall arrogate nothing to our own endeavors, when we have done the best we
can, but ascribe all the honor and merit of what is performed, to our Heavenly
Father and Creator, his Son our Redeemer, and to the Holy Ghost our Sanctifier;
who are, as it were, the Triumvirate, by whom this Kingdom is governed. When we
find these marks upon us, the willingness of our hearts will be accepted as a
complete performance of the whole Law; and we shall have an undoubting
assurance that this Kingdom is in such a measure within us, as will ripen to
perfection in due time. All this, we may find implicitly contained in those
Benedictions recorded in the Gospel, with promises annexed, by our Savior, to
the qualifications there mentioned, Matthew 5. 3. etc. Blessed are the poor in
Spirit: for their's is the Kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn: for
they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the
earth. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they
shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed
are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. Blessed are the Peacemakers:
for they shall be called the Children of God. Blessed are they who are
persecuted for Righteousness sake: for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Blessed
are ye, when men shall revile you, persecute you, and say all manner of evil
against you falsely for my sake: Rejoice then and be glad; for great is your
reward in heaven: so persecuted they the Prophets which were before. These are
not my words, but his, (even the King of this Kingdom) who will make them good;
and as I said before, whosoever shall find these foresaid marks upon him, may
be confident that the Kingdom of Heaven is within him.

The third Petition.
Thy Will be done in earth, as it is in Heaven.
1. WHen with perfect assent thereunto in heart, as well as in words, we can
say this Petition, our work will soon be at an end; for, we shall then be
called home by our Heavenly Father, and there will be no more need of such
things as are prayed for in the three following Petitions. Let us well consider
therefore, what we ask for in these words. They amount in effect to a true self
denial, which is the most difficult thing in the world for flesh and blood to
submit unto; yet, may possibly be made easy, if it were well considered, that
it brings with it the greatest advantages that we can Petition or endeavor
for, by any faculty that we can call our own, seeing God, who can and does
renew the Will, and inclines us thereto, when we pray that his Will may be
rather fulfilled then our own, has promised assistance. It begins to be easy
to a regenerated heart, when it knows that GODS Will and Righteousness are one,
and that our Will and Wickedness also are one (as it is merely our own will)
and brings us into all the mischiefs which befall both in this world and the
world to come, if we are swayed wholly thereby. In this Petition, as in the
former, we ask together with what tends to Gods glory, that which will both
prevent our destruction here, and procure our eternal happiness hereafter. He
that knows God as he may do by what he has manifested, of himself, and of his
goodness toward all Mankind, need never to be afraid to submit his own will to
his; yea, Body, Soul, and all that is most dear and precious in his own esteem,
to be disposed of at his pleasure. This knowledge and confidence is ordinarily
begotten in most men of understanding, by reading and hearing his Word
preached, but sometimes (especially in them whose natural Faculties are
defective) it is wrought by a spiritual Instinct ^^isensibly working in the
Soul a conformity to the Will of God, which is always the same, though to us
it seems to change as we are changed. He has not, as some say, (who delude
themselves and others, by sophisticated distinctions) a secret and a revealed
Will, contradictory to each other; yea, so contradictory, that they may be
rather judged two wills then One. This false opinion causes many to be
distrustful of Gods good meaning toward Mankind; fearful he will reprobate
them, when they have done all they can to please him; and consequently (though
they profess the contrary, and speak many good words of him) blaspheam his
goodness; imputing that unto him, which belongs to the Devil and themselves
only. They, who make unto themselves such a GOD, cannot be better then he; and
I shall not wonder if they cannot pray heartily, that his will may be done.

2. To excuse themselves, there be some of these, who in effect, do
irreverently say thus unto God in their hearts: Who has resisted thy Will?
Thou know that by the sin of our Fathers, and by thy eternal Decree of
Election and Reprobation, the greatest part of mankind is left in (or rather
thrown into) so sad a depraved condition, that we are neither free to will, or
to do what thou requirest. This is impudently to belie and blaspheam GOD: For,
when he said that, The seed of the Woman should break, the Serpents head, he
sanctified the whole humane Nature into a capability of performing so much as
he requires absolutely at our hands; and has ever since, and will for ever, at
first or at last, so inlighten every man who comes into the world, vouchsafing
according to his promise, such a renewing of the will, and such a perpetual
co-assistance, for askng, to perform what shall be accepted for the deed, to
all them who shall not wilfully, maliciously and finally resist his Grace, that
no deficiency in him can be justly laid to his charge, in relation to our
misdoings, as it will be manifested, when all hidden things are discovered at
the last judgment. Indeed, as we are merely in our depraved Nature, we can
neither do or will ought, that is acceptably good; but, as we are in grace we
may: For, then to will, is freely present with us, and our doings perfected by
the Merits of Christ; yea, our misdoings are often by him improved, both to his
Glory and our Salvation; not that we should sin, that Grace may abound, but
that abounding Grace may keep us from sin. If we had not a Free will in
sufficient measure to do, or leave undone, to choose or refuse; then were our
faculties inferior to those of beasts, which do choose or leave such means of
preservation as are set before them; nay were this liberty taken away, or quite
lost, we could not be justly reputed righteous or wicked by our mere personal
default, in respect of any thing which we will, or do, or leave undone. Wise
men do not endeavor to force a Beast to that whereunto he is not naturally
inclined, much less to that whereunto he has a Natural Antipathy, and destroy
him for not doing that which he cannot. By gentle allurements we may by degrees
bring it to change Nature, and become serviceable to our Desires. God, in like
manner Draws us by the Cords of a Man; he forces not our Nature, into a
change but wooeth our will, unto a conformity, with his, by such means as may
secretly and naturally thereto incline the heart, using no other force but such
Fatherly chastisements only, as may remove the perverseness which we have
gotten by evil Custo^^^s, to augment our natural indisposition, which we got by
harkening to his and our Enemies. It is an unquestionable Cruelty, to compel
and necessitate men to that which we know makes them everlastingly miserable;
but doubtless it were no wrong to a Madman to pull him out of the fire
whereinto he had thrown himself; nor injustice in a Father to use the Rod to
fright his Children, from that which may destroy them, when they will neither
do it for love to him or themselves. God afflicts none but for their good,
until they become obstinately Rebellious; he requires no more of any man, then
he has given; Reprobates none finally, unless they are finally unpenitent; and
never willed the destruction of any one who submitted to his will.

3. No man, I think endeavors to teach Beasts to write and read, though some
teach Birds to speak, which can talk with as much understanding of humane
words, as they have of the Mysteries of saving Faith, who discourse and preach
the Word literally, without the Spirit; therefore God has vouchsafed means of
instruction by offering both; and, if their concurrence has not a sufficiency
to effect for every man that which was intended, and promised to all who
despise not his offer, but earnestly seek for it; Why, are we commanded to make
intercession for all men? Why does the Gospel enjoin all to believe in Christ
Jesus, if there had not been a possibility that all might have been saved,
unless by their own default? To what purpose has God sworn he desires not the
death of a sinner, and give his only Son for a general Redemption, that all
men might be saved? Why are so many promises and threatenings cast away upon
them, who are said to be irrecoverably predestined both to condemnation, and
to do all that evil which may bring it upon them; as certainly as the Righteous
are predestined to their Salvation, and to the means thereof? Wherefore do
men so quarrel about Doctrines, and Disciplines, putting themselves and others,
to so much Labor, Cost, and Suffering, as we see they do, imposing the same
duties upon all without exceptions, if the greatest number of men are
Reprobates without hope? I know what is, or may be said by some to those
questionings, and that they are delusive or dissatisfactory answers; For, if we
shall teach men to believe that God has absolutely willed and fore-determined,
as they suppose very few will be thereby encouraged to pray that his Will may
be done. But God has necessitated none to be miserable or wicked; he has
provided means whereby both Sin and Misery may be prevented; or else removed,
if it be timely embraced; and if that by neglect thereof, men seeming righteous
fall not away from their Righteousness. For, by the common outward means
prescribed, to them unto whom it is preached, together with those extraordinary
and supernatural Mediums which God vouchsafes (where they are not preached as
with us) by the Spirit which blows, when, and where it lists, the Will is
by degrees set at liberty form its natural Bondage, and rendered active in the
works of Regeneration, by proposing Gods promises of Supply and Assistance; by
showing their dangers and remedies, and by intermingling Mercies and Judgments;
and if these prevail not, it is not by any bar fore-determined by God, both
because their own wilfulness and negligence has lulled them asleep in
security, until they are hardened into a final impenitency.

4. Many men who are sick, have no will to take such Physical ingredients as
are wholesome and necessary for recovery of their healths, but naturally abhor
them with such a detestation, that they will not be persuaded or enforced to
receive them by those who have most power over them (though they are likely to
loose their lives by that wilfulness) yet, by the prudence and gentle
persuasions of a wise and loving Physician, taking away their nauseousness by
other corrective Ingredients, and assuring them of health, they are won at last
to accept thereof, and recover: So it fares with us who are naturally averse
from the means which the Holy Ghost prescribes to correct our depraved will,
when we are not finally obstinate, and have made our selves worse, and more
miserable by evil Customs ripened into an Habitual wickeness, then we were by a
depraved Nature. Christ bewailed Jerusalem with tears, not because she could
not, but because she would not embrace the means of her preservation and
prosperity, through that wilfulness which she had contracted by her own
default; else, his bewailings had not proceeded from true compassion, which it
were a Capital sin to affirm: And they who deny what God has done, and
continues to do for them; or affirm, that he has not given them ability
whereby they may cooperate with him in doing what he commands, and in avoiding
that which he has forbidden, are ungrateful Blasphemers and Liars: For, the
contrary not only evidenced in his Word, but is also demonstrable by that
whereof we have, or may have an experiment. If a Drunkard, or a Thief, or an
Adulterer, or any other gross sinner, who has most accustomed himself to
prevaricate, were told by him, whom he knew to have both power and will to
inflict what he threatens, that the next time he was drunk, or committed any of
the sins aforementioned, he should be immediately tormented to death; and if
this man knew and still saw one watching him night and day in public and in
secret, at home and abroad, ready to execute him immediately for that
transgression, I am confident that Drunkard, Thief, or Adulterer, who was most
tempted to act those sins, would forbear them so long as he had such an
Attendant, unless he were grown so distracted that he knew not what he did;
And, if this be so, (whereof I think no reasonable man doubts) then, whosoever
says it is not in his power to forbear those sins which he actually commits, I
dare say unto him, it is not altogether through want of ability to perform so
much as God requires, but because he neglects the Grace offered, or that
watchfulness over himself which is necessary and possible; or, because he
believes not Gods promises and threatenings; or forgets or heeds not that he
sees him in all places, at all times, and will severely punish his carelessness
and presumption; and, this is that which renders every castaway liable to
Reprobation, and no fore-determination of God necessitating him thereunto. More
might be said to this purpose, but I hope this shall suffice to preserve a
reverent esteem of Gods Justice and Mercy; as also, to make us heedful what may
be a help or hinderance to preserve us willing, and constant in praying Gods
will may be done in Earth as it is in Heaven. I am so large in this, and some
other seeming digressions, because I sometimes find, that, the furthest way
about, is the nearest way home.

5. It hereby partly appears why we should absolutely refer our will to Gods,
and pray for the accomplishment thereof in all things, and on all men without
exception; and that we have no other means to be freed from being inslaved by
the corrupt arbitrary will of Tyrants, or from being in a worse bondage, to our
own will. Oh! that we could consider as we ought to do, how we are insensibly
drawn by evil Customs and bad Examples, to fall away by degrees into a
Reprobated sense, yielding first to one vain act which we think so innocent,
that it conduces to no evil; then to another, and another after that, till at
last the grossest wickedness, is rushed into without stop; Yea, into that,
which a while before we thought to be both foolish and wicked, and condemned
and derided in other men: Thus it fares even with some who have been in a good
measure inlighted, and purged from many gross, corruptions: for when the Will
is in some degree renewed, and the sing he Talent which was formerly neglected
and abused, somewhat improved (which might have been multiplied according to
what was required, as well as his who had five) they seeing their Houses swept
and garnished, admit instead of the Devil which was cast out, such a spirit of
pride, with his Associates, as makes their later ends worse then their
beginnings. GOD having delivered all men from the guilt of Adams transgression,
by Christ's, giving every one wherewith to perform his duty, (renewing also his
Grace to many, more then once or twice, after they have forfeited it) very
hazzardous (if not damnable) is their condition, who presumptuously offend so
Gracious a Master. Let us therefore, watch and pray, that we fall not
irrecoverably into temptation and surprise, even for our own sakes, at least,
until Self-love shall be improved into a True love, of him who loved us first;
and seeing nothing can be more mischievous unto us then our Self-will, let us
not only pray heartily that Gods will may be done, but endeavor so to submit
our wills to his, that his will and ours may be one.

6. Before this can be possible, those Obstructions must be removed, which the
World, the Flesh, and the Devil have raised up within us, to keep our Will from
union with Gods; to wit, a believing the suggestions of the Serpent, as our
first Parents did, when they were seduced and tempted by a desirable Object;
and by his misrepresenting unto them the Foreknowledge, and Fore-determination
of God; as also, by insinuating a want of Love or Good meaning toward Mankind,
in that which he willed and prohibited: when any are thus prepossessed, it must
be one as strong as the Almighty who can cast out those Devils* and cast out
they must be, before they can heartily pray, Gods will may be done: For, who
can persuade those men by Arguments, or move them by Threatenings, to commit
themselves and all other things to his will, whose Justice is made doubtful, or
of whose Love to him in particular he is uncertain; or, by such means only
assured, as may be questionable, and are communicated to Reprobates, as well as
to the Elect; considering also, what fair appearances there are of their good
effects sometimes, even upon Hypocrites, when they are but false counterfeited
works? These Obstructions alone, are enough to hinder the conforming of our
will to Gods, if they be not removed: Therefore, though these are not all, I
will assay the removing of them, before I proceed further. And, in regard it is
said that the persuasions of our own hearts, are as good as many Counselors;
(and not altogether useless, though deceitful, when their single advice is
wholly depended upon) I will precaution a little by the way, concerning that.
It is true, that every Unregenerated man's heart is fraudulent in his Natural
estate; Yet, when it is Regenerated, and depends not upon self-Apprehensions,
by the mere natural Light which is therein, but seeks after, and receives with
Approbation that Divine Light which is offered and communicated thereto by the
Word and Spirit of GOD, it is essentially efficient both to the rectifying and
conforming of our WILL, to and with that Object whereunto we ought to adhere;
and then more to be depended on then the Authority of all the wisest men in the
World, without that Evidence. For, when God has prevailed to persuade the
heart, by such a concurrence of Lights, it will not then deceive any; but be as
infallible as the white Sione, which is known to none but to him that has it.
I know no means how in these days, we may be assured such Revelations are of
God, as that was, when he commanded Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac; For,
how strongly soever our hearts may be inclined thereunto, we having now our
Communion with God in another mode, all Inspirations repugnant to what is
revealed in the Law and Prophets, interpreted by his Evangelical Word and
Spirit, are to be rejected as diabolical suggestions.

7. The Law is our Schoolmaster to bring us to Christ; but it will never bring
us into him, until his Love opens the door, which he has freely opened, keeps
it open, and offers entrance to all who desire and seek it; yea, and to some
before they sought it: And, when being entered, we there behold his Beauty, and
feel the fervor of his Love, it so inflames our love to him (if not
prepossessed and bewitched with other affections) that our will does Zealously
and contentedly cleave unto him. We may preach the Law and pronounce
Judgments (as some have done, till they have brought Despair and Hell into the
Souls of many) but, that begets more fear then love, or at best more love to
our selves then unto him; or, more cautiousness then willingness, until
Evangelical Lenitives, be therewith applied. It is the making known Christ's
meek condescentions, long-sufferings, and the superexcellent Amiableness of his
Love and tender Mercies, that soonest and most effectually work in us
repentance of our sins, and that confidence in him, which will incline us,
without a reserve, to pray absolutely to his and our Fa-Father, that his will
may be done. But, some have taken a course direct contrary, and made such
Representations of God, that I conceive their Doctrine to be the greatest
obstruction of all other to praying absolutely, that his Will may be done in
earth, as it is in heaven. It will never be a motive thereunto, to tell men,
that before all worlds (when there was no man to resist his will, or desirous
of a being, whereby he might have had a possibility of resisting it, or to
offend him in any manner) God, foredecreed Create an Innocent Creature, (whom
he himself saw and acknowledged to be good after he had created him) that,
having accordingly made him, breathed a portion of his own Spirit into him,
Given him Dominion over all his Creatures upon earth, and commanded him to
increase and multiply; at the same moment pre-ordained, according to an
Irrevocable Decree (before that Creature, or any of his Generation had done
good or evil) that the greatest part of his Posterity should he everlastingly
reprobated and damned, for committing sins, which his Decree also, had
necessatated them to commit. Moreover, that having predestined a means
whereby this poor Creatures Posterity might be saved; promised Mercy should
without exception, be vouchsafed to all who believed in his Son; commanded that
Salvation to be offered and preached to all Nations; and that even then he knew
it was Decreed by himself, that the greatest number of men, were made incapable
of accepting what was promised, or of having any benefit thereby, when they had
done the utmost they could to obtain it. All this, and much more to this
purpose is averred of Gods Decrees, by those who understood them not, and
supposed what was never by them intended; and who can submit their wills to
such a GOD as these have made?

I will not say as some have done (published it also in their writings)
Diabolus est quorundam Calvinistarm Doni, for, I believe many so called,
profess the true God in whom I believe, though by heedlesness, ignorance, and
overmuch confiding in persons of whose Learning and Piety they have had a high
Opinion, they are blinded with an appearance than their error tends rather to
the honor, then to the dishonor of God; and I intend nothing to their
personal disparagement or disadvantage; for, I heartily pray and hope they will
be ashamed of it, and sorry for it upon future consideration, as I my self was,
who escaped not being infected with this Heresy in my younger days, till I had
experimental knowledge of the false grounds and evil effects thereof: But now
knowing what use the Devil makes of it in this my Generation to Gods dishonor;
I cannot forbear my witness against it, when just occasion is offered; though
some say, I insist on it more then is needful, and to my own disadvantage,
which I find true in temporal respects, having suffered more by them whose
fierce Zeal in that Heresy has made them to persecute me in secret, then by
all my open Enemies: And I do foresee a possibility that their power who
approve this Doctrine which I abhor, may hereafter be so prevalent, that if I
live to see it established according to their hope, I must expect no more
favor in this world until I dye, then heretofore I have had, unless I survive
to see that Kingdom come visibly upon earth, which shall utterly destroy the
Mystical Whore and her Daughter the well-favoured Harlot, with all those who
have been made drunk by her Cup of Fornications, and worn the Mark of the Beast
in their Foreheads, or in their hands; yet, I fearing neither Evils present,
or to come, will proceed with what I mean to say.

9. It is of evil consequence to impute that to God, which common and approved
Reason judges to be unrighteous in men. His works are so just, and so merciful
is he in all his ways, that there is no appearance of the contrary. His
Justice is vindicated by the Prophets, against that which has been objected by
that Nation, who had most cause to acknowledge both his Justice and Mercy. And
David's confession his sin, in Psalm. 51. as to that point here treated of,
acknowledges him to be justifiable by whomsoever he shall be judged. All Gods
Decrees are perfectly just, and whatsoever he wills is perfectly good.
Nevertheless, all is not so which men shall say he has Decreed or Willed; For,
many have fathered upon him such Decrees as he never made; such Ordinances as
he never intended; the Believing, Doing, and Forbearing, of such things as were
never by Him commanded or forbidden; and ascribed to him such a Will as never
did reveal to be His. That, which they call his secret Will, who can know, if
it be kept secret? and if they know it, how is it then secret? Such imputations
as are before expressed, I cannot believe, because they consist not with his
Honor, Justice, and Mercy, which are always one with his Will, and his Will
always the same, and not two opposite Wills, as it is, at least, implied by
their Sophistry, who affirm, he has both a secret and a revealed will,
relating to one and the same Objects, and Qualifications contradictorily
differing from each other; whereas his revealed will, is but a part of the same
will, kept secret till it shall be seasonably made known at full; As when Jonah
said, Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be destroyed: for, in these words there
was an implicit condition to be understood, though not expressed, as appears by
the event, which demonstrated that, his Entire will (whereof one part preached
by Jonah) was this, that, Nineveh should be destroyed within the time limited,
if it repented not; and the other part concealed, was this, That it should not
be destroyed, if it repented within forty days; and by what Jonah did, by the
Repentance of the Ninevites, and their preservation thereupon; it seems both he
and they understood the whole will of God, though but part thereof was vocally
revealed. Therefore, the School-definition aforementioned of a Secret, and a
Revealed will, relating contradictorily to the same things, and persons, seems
fitter to be applied to Impostures of Juglers, then to the Righteous, Pure,
Single and Secret will of Almighty GOD. Yet, as Jonah (though a Prophet) seemed
more desirous that great City should have been destroyed, then his credit lost
by Gods extending Mercy there unto contrary to the Verbal Tenor of his
Prophecy; so, it may be feared, that some who teach men to believe, God
foredetermined the greatest number of Adams Posterity to everlasting damnation,
would be as froward as Jonah, to have it made evident they had lost their
credit by preaching false Doctrine, in that point; For, as well Gospel-Preachers,
as other Good and Pious men, have errors and fits of distemper through humane
frailty, from which it may be hoped they will recover, and repent heartily what
they have mistaught, as to the particular aforesaid, when it shall be made
probable, at least, that many more will be saved then condemned at the last
Judgment, and that they have both to the disadvantage of Mankind, and to Gods
dishonor misrepresented this Universal act of Free Grace.

10. It would be a superlative dishonor, and an unpardonable indignity, put
upon an earthly King, if his Officers should deal with him, as some of Gods
pretended Commissioners have done, in that which is of highest concernment in
relation to his honor, and man's welfare. For, whereas, that King of kings,
has vouchsafed an universal Act of Indemnity, from that guilt whereto all men
were liable by Adams transgression; and m tender compassion and pure love to
his Subjects, decreed likewise a general pardon, whereby all actual
Transgressors (without excepting either High Treason, or other offenses
whatsoever) repenting, submitting to his Mercy, and suing for that pardon,
should freely be forgiven without any other costs or merits of their own; And,
whereas this Indulgence has by his faithful Ambassadors and Agents, been
proclaimed throughout the world; some other, assuming to themselves the like
Authority, have either through Ignorance, or upon less excusable inducements,
proclaimed that which is almost totally destructive to that gracious
Condescension; telling us, that to testify his abundant love to Mankind in
general, and to his especial Favorites in particular, who are known only to
himself; God has indeed offered Pardon to all, that his Mercy in sparing
whomsoever he pleased, how wicked soever, might be the more evidenced to them,
if he spared not those who were less offenders; and, that though it was his
Revealed will and pleasure, the offer of such a general Pardon as aforesaid
should be divulged, it was nevertheless, his secret will, that both they to
whom he intended benefit thereby, and they to whom no good was intended, should
be put to the same cost and labor in suing for it, but neither the one or the
other be certain of it, whilst he lived; Yea, they tell us that before the said
Proclamation was issued forth, it was decreed the greatest number should be so
maimed and disabled, that it would be impossible for them to perform the
conditions required, to make them capable of the said Pardon, which they say
was done, to evidence (as they call it) his just displeasure against
Unrighteousness. And then to beget a vain hope in their hearers, (or rather to
increase the number of those Clyents, by whose credulity their Fees and
Temporary profit may be augmented) these Officers further tell them, that the
King whom they have thus represented, is so just and merciful, that
notwithstanding all before expressed, they may make his absolute Will and
Pleasure, their Supreme law without danger; and to keep them in heart (by
cherishing a belief thereof, until perhaps an irrecoverable fit of desperation
seizes on them) they befool them with a confidence in such Marks of their
assured Election, as may be frequently found upon reprobated Hypocrites. This
is the effect of that which many have preached concerning Gods dealing with
Mankind; And, what can be reasonably judged of such Officers, and of such
dealings? What will all their other Services amount unto, pretended to Gods
Honor, or to the Security and Happiness of his People, where they are poisoned
and annihilated by such Doctrine? Hereby, in my Judgment, it amounts to that,
which is abominable in the highest degree; and so far should I be from
confiding in an earthly Prince, who approved and practiced such pretendings to
Justice and Mercy; or from loving him otherwise then an Enemy; that, if he
should confer upon me, all that were in his power to bestow, yea resign his
whole Kingdom to me and my posterity; yet, be evidently, unmercifully and
wilfully unjust to other innocent men without repentance; I should more abhor
the memory of him, notwithstanding that favor to me, then for condemning me to
suffer causlesly at the Gallows, if he were just and merciful to the rest of
his Subjects, and to all other men. I may perhaps, herein seem over-far
transported; but, that before expressed, being (as I believe) equivalent to
such Doctrine as is by some taught, in relation to God and Mankind, is in my
apprehension, so horrible a blasphemy, that having such an impulse as I have
upon me, to bear witness against it, I deserved, should I neglect it, to be
deserted in my greatest need, both of God, and of all good men.

11. For, whatsoever opinion other-men have of it, I conceive that all the
Idolatries of the Heathen heretofore, in communicating to Men, Beasts, or
Devils, the Honor and Attributes which are due to God only, (and the
crucifying of Christ in the flesh through Ignorance, added thereunto) amount
not to so heinous an offense, as their crime who are knowingly guilty of this
sin; because, it seems to me more pardonable, to ascribe unto a base creature,
part of that Honor which is due to God, then to impute that unto him, which is
proper to none but to the most wicked of all his creatures, who being by him
created good, became depraved by his own malicious default: And, I am hopeful,
that so many as have been heretofore misled into this Heresy by Ignorance only
(or by overmuch trust in humane Authority) and not more afraid to take shame
unto themselves for their errors, before men of their own Judgment, then to
continue in them without fear of Gods displeasure, will better consider
hereafter, what they ought to believe and teach in relation to Gods Justice and
Mercy; and that all their own Knowledge, and Righteousness, will not conduce so
much to their comfort and reputation, as their unfeigned Repentance, and
Acknowledgment of this Error. I will ask no pardon of them who shall think I
need one for this extravagant zeal, because I know whose honor it concerns;
what warrant I have to express it; and what need there is of such plain dealing
in this matter, and in this manner at this time. I am persuaded also, that God
now furnished me with means of subsistence when the world had left me less then
nothing, of that which I lately had; and spared my life when so many thousands
fell round about me, that once more before I die I might thus bear testimony
against this Blasphemy, which God more abhors, then all those Errors reproved
in the seven Churches of Asia. For, the devil who is Author thereof, having
insinuated it into the 7 Reformed Churches of Europe, has in subtlety
permitted the Professors of his Antichristian Mystery of Iniquity, to detest
it, that by their holding a part of Truth in Unrighteousness, the wickedness of
that Mystery might be the less suspected (as he thought his design would be,
when he acknowledged Jesus to be the Son of God) and his policy has not been
without an ill effect, in regard it has given some an occasion to call that
Truth Popery, which was not only professed before Popery had a Being, but is
also the foundation of all saving Truths, revealed ever since the Creation of
the world.

12. They who shall take notice of so much as is revealed by Gods Word and
Spirit, to give an assurance that he has no secret will contradictory unto
what he has revealed, (though he keeps hidden so much thereof, as flesh and
blood is not yet capable of), may so justify God in his uprightness, as to the
Love which is by him professed to mankind, that, he may without scruple submit
to him, in whatsoever concerns his happiness, both in this world and that which
is to come: For, whosoever is true and upright toward him in his trust and
love, so far as he may be capable thereof, should find Hell to be a Heaven if
he were there; and that Heaven would be a Hell unto him, if he could possibly
get thither with self-confidence, and with his own Natural will; because, it is
not the place wherein we are, that can make us happy or unhappy, but that which
we carry thither within our selves. Yet, I would have no man in these
concernments, trust to me, or to any other farther then he has assurance in
his conscience, by the same witnesses; for the Light within us may deceive,
though attested by all humane Authorities without the Word; yea, and the Word
written, has such variety of senses, and Interpretations put upon it, that, it
must be ascertained by the Spirit also; and every Spirit tried by the Word,
with a conscientious heed, how every part thereof may agree together in one
sense without contradiction; for some words wherewith we are best acquainted;
even in our Mother Tongue, have such various significations, that I am forced
to many tedious circumlocutions to prevent misunderstanding, and yet am often
misunderstood. But by the Lights aforementioned united together, I having
examined the Objections, and answers of dissenting Parties, am so infallibly
convinced of the Oneness and Righteousness of Gods will; as also, that he has
no respect or disrespect of Persons without regard to their qualifications,
that I know he has necessitated or constrained none to be wicked; that, he
reprobateth no Righteous man, who wilfully discontinueth not to be Righteous;
or any wicked man, who abhors and finally forsakes his wickedness; or any
whosoever, who does not wittingly, wilfully, despightfully, and finally sin
against the Holy Ghost; which so strengthens my belief of his perfect Goodness,
Justice and Mercy; and so inclines me to love him with all my heart, and with
all my strength, that in all things I can absolutely, without the least
scruple, pray and say unto him, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.

13. To confirm me and others in this free Resignation of our wills to the
Will of God revealed in his Word; I may add this out of my own experience
(and I hope it is a sanctified experience) which perhaps may have as good
effects on some other, as it has had on me. Our Natural will, as it stands
inclinable, when it has no better guide then the single Light within us, is
usually carried on so violently to accomplish the fulfilling thereof, even as
to things which are good in themselves, that, they may have an evil
consequence. This appears by these particular Instances; we may have a will to
be endowed with the best Spiritual Gifts; to be righteous according to the
strictness of the Moral Law; To be patient and constant in sufferings; to be
careless of the preferments, riches and pleasures of this world, to be eminent
in the mortifying of the flesh by fasting and penances voluntarily undergone;
to be frequent in hearing, praying and external performances of pious Duties,
with such like, thereupon persuading our selves we do it to serve, please and
honor God; and that thereby we merit his Favor: whereas, if we narrowly,
examine our hearts, we shall find, perhaps, that our principal aim, proceeded
from self-love, and to acquire thereby a Righteousness and perfection of our
own, wherein to rest and glory; and that we desire not so much to be
conformable (according to our proportion) unto Christ in his obedience and
sufferings, (not of pure Love to him) as that we might be sharers with him in
the meritoriousness thereof; falsely supposing his obedience, righteousness and
sufferings would not be sufficiently satisfactory without our doing and
suffering such things in our own persons, to complete our justification. This,
if we be not heedful, will lie hid in our hearts, when we profess the contrary
with our mouths; And I have often observed, as well in my self as in others,
that this may puff us up with a spirit of prides, to such a high conceit of our
selves, and beget in us such an uncharitable or low esteem of others, that when
we seem to be purged from gross carnal sins, we may be polluted with spiritual
wickednesses, more mischievous unto our souls; because, they not appearing to
be so sinful as they are, will be the more difficultly repented, and we the
more hardly disinsnared from them: For I have heeded that many being entangled
by these, having run through the profession and practice of the Doctrines and
Disciplines of most Sects, to get the repute of a supereminent Sanctity, could
never settle any where until they fell back again into the pollutions of the
flesh in a more gross manner then at first; or else stumbled into the Church of
Rome, which admits them gladly; because, the ambition of her Children is the
same, and their Justification and Righteousness depends very much on their own
merits.

14. Many such Vertigoes and Impostures, I have in my time heard of, and seen
acted by self-willed persons pretending to extraordinary Revelations, which had
no ground, but their own Fancies and overweening. One supposing himself called
to gather together the dispersed Jews, and carry them into Palestine their
ancient Inheritance, has to that end made ridiculous preparations. Another of
no mean parts, had fancied a certain day in which Christ should be seen coming
again in the Clouds, and got up into a high place the better to behold his
approach; having forgotten that it was said his second coming should be like
the Lightning out of the East, shining into the West. A woman, blasphemously
termed her self the Virgin Mary, and found some foolish enough so to repute
her. Another, would be thought the Woman in the Wilderness, mentioned in the
Revelation of St. John, fleeing thither from the Dragon; others, infatuated by
the like spirit of delusion, have gone naked through the streets, and into
public Assemblies, to be signal to the Nation. Two, lately assumed the Title
and Office of the two VVitnesses, prophesied of in the Apocalypse, and had
giddy followers, though they brought no testimonial thereof, but such vanities
as deserved contempt. Another, was persuaded to be the Angel flying through the
midst of heaven, to preach the everlasting Gospel; and we had one, who presumed
wickedly to personate Jesus Christ. Yea, whilst I was writing these
Meditations, I was visited by a person (in other respects, sober and of good
understanding) who professing her self to be guided by no Example or Rule (but
what was inwardly revealed unto her) told me she was assured by Revelation,
that she should be the greatest sufferer that ever was in the world; and
indeed, if all be true which she declared unto me, of her sufferings many years
by voluntary watchings, fastings, cold, hunger, nakedness, and pilgrimages into
foreign parts, without any provision, for her passage or support, which so
multiplied her sufferings, that (as she said) the Spanish Inquisitors, in whose
power she then was, told her that she should be reputed one of the most
glorious Saints in her time, if she would cast her self into the bosom of
their Church, as they persuaded her to do. And it appeared by her own
expressions, that a secret spiritual pride, made her to glory in those
voluntary sufferings, as more to be depended on then Christ's. But, I hope this
spirit of delusion will be cast out of her, when she is better informed; for by
trusting to false lights, and by admitting a self-merit, of being divinely
illuminated, and called to the highest Form of Sanctity, not only produces a
melancholy madness, and many wicked fooleries, to the scandalizing of Piety,
with the sincere professors thereof; and, to the advancement of the mystery of
Iniquity, whose abetters do secretly sow and cherish the seeds of Impostures,
every where, to that end.

15. Nevertheless, we must not exclude these out of our charitable hope and
care, nor disaffect their persons, though we approve not their follies: For,
even the Apostles misapprehended the nature of Christ's Kingdom until they were
perfectly enlightened, and affected vain superiority, as it seems by the Sons of
Zebedeus, when they got their good old Mother to entreat their Master, that,
one of them might sit at his right hand, and the other at his left; yea, they
were tempted by the spirit of persecution, when they would have had fire called
down from Heaven; and God does now as heretofore permit errors, and vouchsafe
signal cautionary dispensations (as the sins and errors of the times require)
to be sometimes personated, by his servants, in such manner, that, they seem
ridiculous and offensive to good men, and are in the Kingdom of this world,
reputed Fools and Phanaticks. These things I have so well considered, that I am
afraid to indulge my own will, so far forth, as to pray absolutely for those
lawful things which are most pleasing to my flesh, and seem very pertinent to
my natural well-being, because I find not my self wise enough to know how much
either of sufferings or ease are best for me; or what I might well use, or
abuse, if I should be mine own chuser. Therefore, I pray absolutely for
nothing, save Gods Grace, but, bound my Petitions with this Clause, Thy Will be
done. And this is now made easy, because (as I have often professed) I want
nothing, with a repining sense of want, so long as God is pleased to withold
it from me; in regard, I am sure he knows what is best for me, and has love
enough to vouchsafe it in that measure, and at that time, wherein it shall so
be. I naturally feel pains, and desire ease as much as other men; I perceive as
well as they when my Field wants Rain, or fair weather; am as desirous of those
good gifts, whereby I might benefit my self or others; and cannot root out of
my heart a natural desire of desirable Objects; yet I permit not my desire to
be further inclinable thereto, then shall consist with Gods Will; and am
assured it is then more acceptable, then when we have no temptation or desire
to the contrary: For, what obedience is there in him who shuns those forbidden
things which he naturally abhors to do? or in him, who is constantly obedient
to those commands only which he is most inclinable to do? There is more
submission due to Gods Will then this; even an absolute submission in that
whereto our natural will is most violently prone. And God has so far forth
freed the will of every Man born of a Woman, ever since it was promised, That
the Seed of the Woman should break the Serpents head, That, by his promised
assisting Grace (which never shall be wanting to them who ask it in Faith) he
may not withstanding any permissive power in the Devil, or any irresistible
defect in himself, conform to the Will of God, when by his Word and Spirit,
the choice of good or evil, death, or life is to him offered: For, if it be not
so, man can have in him no more sin or righteousness then a stone. This I
believe, and all they who believe this, are in a good forwardness; toward
submitting their will to Gods.

16. How Gods will may be done by us on earth, as it is in heaven, according to
our measure, I will endeavor to demonstrate as well as I can. We may collect
from his holy Word, being interpreted by his holy Spirit (which makes no part
repugnant to the whole and main scope thereof) that, when the Kingdom of Christ
is come to a perfect manifestation upon Earth, the Will of God will be there
as perfectly fulfilled as in heaven; because all the Subjects of that Kingdom,
being One with the King thereof, and the whole extent of it with all therein
(though infinite) being seen in him, (and fully known to all) the will of every
Creature shall be swallowed up in his, and, he be all in all. This
superintelligible Mystery cannot be fully demonstrated to our apprehension, as
we now are: So much only we are capable of, as that we may know the
deficiencies of our own will, with the hazzards of adhering thereto, and become
thereby inclinable to resign our selves to God, at first perhaps through fear,
and at last for love. But when that manifestation comes, they who are of his
household and Kingdom, will abhor every thing, how precious soever it has been,
that may divide or take up any part of that love, which is due to their
heavenly Father; hate all who love him not, as perfectly as natural men hate
their personal Enemies; renounce all things, even themselves, if cause be, for
his sake, with whatsoever may not consist with the purity and glory of that
Kingdom. They being all of one Mind, there will be no disputes as now, about
Doctrines and Disciplines, no arrogating an exorbitant judging power over
persons and Causes, whereof they have neither perfect cognizance, nor lawful
jurisdiction; no such unnecessary arguings as are here concerning Faith and
Works, or whether Repentance be before Faith, with such like trifling
Questions, as have not a little disturbed the Peace and Concord, which ought to
be preserved; For though Spiritual Graces appear to have precedence in time,
one before the other, in regard we cannot take notice of such Objects one view,
or in what order they are wrought within us; Yet, all that which is by degrees
manifested in time, as pertinent to our Spiritual well-being, is in one moment
conceived in us by the Holy Ghost, as the Soul is together with the Body in the
womb of a Woman. When the Kingdom we look for is come upon Earth, there will be
no such distinct Interests as are now here. All things will be common in a more
excellent manner, then in the times of the Apostles, and no such Self-seekings
and Hypocrisy as was then discovered in Ananias and Saphira, because, as it is
mystically expressed in the Revelation of St. John, the very pavement of the
City of our King, will be pure and transparent gold; which presignified (as I
conceive) that all men's walkings will be then perfectly undefiled, and so
visibly made known to be such, that none shall be distrustful of each others
Integrity; An universal Love shall cement together inseparably, every precious
Stone of that building; Yea, a Love excluding all the Fear, Jealousy, and
Envy, which might imbitter their Enjoyments and Affections, into whom that
Kingdom is come: For, though there will be a differing Glory, (as among the
Stars which excel one another) the least shall be as fully and as highly
contented with his measure of Joy, and his degree of exaltation, as he that is
greatest; and every one take as much pleasure in the Glorification of others,
as in his own. Much more might be said, to this purpose, and to give some
hints, whereby it may be known of what Nature this Kingdom is, and when it is
come into us; But, this and that which the Spirit of God will further dictate
as need shall require, will be sufficient to raise an apprehension to make us
confident, that when his Kingdom comes upon Earth, his will shall be here done,
as it is in Heaven.

17. Nevertheless, it seems impossible to some that the Will of God should be
fulfilled in Earth, as it is in Heaven; and so it would be, unless it shall he
more gloriously manifested, then either now or heretofore; and we should not
have been taught so to pray, if it were not to be expected in another mode. Our
Father had the same Kingdom upon Earth, from the first Creation thereof; and
the Reign of his Anointed Son was more visible when he first came in the flesh,
then in preceding Ages. But it is said to be a Kingdom yet to come, in regard
of that more evident manifestation which it shall still have from time to time,
and especially after the six Mystical Days, of a thousand years a piece are
finished. During that space, the Devil called the Prince of this world (and his
Vicegerents) are to exercise a power by Divine permission, that the evil
whereof our first Parents desired Knowledge, might be as far forth made known to
their whole Posterity, as might be permitted, with preservation of the humane
Nature from being utterly destroyed; And, that, when the great Sabbath of Years
came, the Beauty and Perfection of GOODNESS, might be thereby the more
Illustrated, as the Day is by the darkness of the Night; and as well known to
Mankind as evil has been, and shall be experimentally manifested before the
Mystical week is completed: For though the Devil lied when he tempted the Son
of God, with an offer of all the Kingdoms of the Earth, in saying all those
were given unto him; Yet, some appearance of Truth may seem to have been
therein, if we consider what Arbitrary power his Vicegerents have Arrogated and
Exercised, by their being accomptable to none in this life, for their
Mis-governments: For many of them, have been the most wicked men in the world;
chief Actors in bringing the knowledge of evil to perfection, by making it as
well felt, as intelligibly known; and They and the Nations under their
Governments, have mutually so corrupted each other, that, the greatest benefit
we have now hope of by their Counsels, Reasons of State, and Arbitrary Actings,
is this; their Wickedness ere long will be so fully Ripe, that it will bring
hither that King and Kingdom, whereby we shall perfectly know and enjoy that
GOODNESS, which will root all wickedness out of the Earth; and perhaps be an
occasion of cutting that time of their Tyranny somewhat shorter then it might
else have been, according to that Scripture where it is said, that the days of
Antichrists last cruelty, should be shortened for the sake of his Elect.

18. The Kingdom we pray for, now is, and has been in some proportion, both
visibly and invisibly upon the Earth in all Ages, and his will there done
according to the similitude expressed in this Prayer, and in the Children
thereof, so far forth as they were and are capable; And, whereas it is said,
When Christ comes, shall he find faith upon Earth? (as it may also be
questioned, whether when he comes, he shall find in any man an absolute
Resignation of his will to GODS) It implies not (in my understanding) either an
universal Nagative or Affirmative; but that he shall then find both Faith and
Self-denial in some: For as there is an Old Will, and an Old Earth, by Nature
in man, which he had from Adam; so, there is also a New Earth, and a New Heaven
or will in man, partly come (and more perfectly to come into us, and into the
world, by Christ) between whom there is and shall be a continual warfare, until
Christ's personal coming. They in whom the first natural Earthlyness and will,
are predominant, shall have no such faith or willingness found in them when
Christ comes; But, he shall then find both such a Faith, and such a Will as is
expected, in all those into whom that new Earth, and that new Heaven is come,
which is predicted in the Revelations to St. John; for that is a mystical
Expression of that Kingdom, which shall descend both into our Microcosme, or
little World, and appear gloriously in this great World. Into this Kingdom
there shall enter no imperfect, or unclean thing; the Glory and Honor of all
Nations, shall be brought into it. The fearful, whose cowardice makes them
Apostatize in persecution, Unbelievers, Murderers, Whoremongers, Sorcerers,
Idolaters and Liers, shall be shut out of it; for, this Kingdom shall not need,
as do the Kingdoms of this world, to be supported, by publishing Lies, by
depressing Truths, by Dissemblings, false Accusations, Plottings, Perjuries,
Oppressions, and such like. The City and Royal Palace thereof, shall be more
strongly fortified, and more gloriously beautified, then we are able to
imagine, or conceive, by all those excellent Metaphorical Allusions to the most
precious Earthly things, whereby St. John (as is before hinted) has
endeavored to raise us up to some apprehension by Faith, which cannot be made
known so excellent as it is, by any Words, or natural Demonstrations. Our
Father, the King of Righteousness, even the Lord GOD Almighty, is sole King
thereof, to whom we may with that perfect Joy and Love, which casts out Fear,
say, Thy will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven; which short Petition
comprehends all that is contained in this brief Prayer, relating either to God
or our selves, as this Prayer contains implicitly, all that is absolutely to
be prayed for, by the most exact Public Liturgies, and by all the Prayers of
every Congregation, and Individual person upon Earth. Nevertheless, remember
this, that though this is so Universal a Prayer as aforesaid, and though God
knows what we want before we ask it; yet our insisting upon particulars is
necessary, to keep us mindful of our duties to God, heedful of those wants
which we have in our selves, and diligent upon all occasions, to seek and ask
supply from him only, in Words and Musings, regulated by this Prayer;
believing that we have attained to the highest perfection attainable in this
life, when we can say unfeignedly, Thy will be done in Earth, as it is in
Heaven.

The fourth Petition.
Give us this day, our daily bread, etc.
1. NOw I come to those Petitions, that immediately concern our selves; which
we are never so sure to obtain, as when we have first sought the Kingdom of
heaven; for, God has promised it upon that condition, and I have had a
personal experience of his faithful performance, though I have been a very
negligent Seeker. Therefore, that, we loose not our labors, when we come to be
Petitioners for what is deficient as to our solves; I wish we might all turn
true Seekers. In the first of these three following Petitions, we ask that
which is necessary to preserve our subsistence and well-being in Soul and Body:
In the second Petition we pray for the pardon of our Debts and Trespasses: In
the third and last, for deliverance from temptations, and from those Evils
which they may else bring upon us. In the few words, whereof the first of these
Petitions consists, many things are offered to consideration. First, that God
our heavenly Father is the general Provider and Restorer of all good and
necessary things; for, we are not taught to pray unto one who has not
wherewith to supply our wants, The earth is the Lords, with all the fullness
thereof: He gives meat unto all Creatures in due season, opening his hand, and
filling them with that which is good. None of his Children needs to despair, or
seek unto his Enemies for relief; or, to supply their wants, by evil or
unlawful means. For, he feeds Sparrows, which are of little value; and Lions,
and Ravens, when they are hungry; yea, Tyrants and Oppressors; how much more
then, will he feed his own Children, when they ask for Bread? We are not to
pray for it as due by merit, but to obtain it in free Alms: Nor are we to ask
it (as the Prodigal Son did his) for a Childe's portion: For, that was
entrusted with our First-Parents, who spent it, and left us more in debt, then
we had ever been able co pay, and liable to have been everlasting Slaves and
Prisoners, if our Eldest brother had not set us free; which obliges us to
perpetual thankfulness, and unfeigned Love; For, the Prodigals Elder brother
was not so kind to him. We have also obtained (besides our share in a joint
Stock) personal individual Portions, from our Heavenly Father by his Mediation,
to supply that which we lost in Adam, with an invaluable Overplus. This we have
so badly husbanded by our own defaults, and live also among so many Thieves,
and Cheaters, that we are every day in danger to be undone, and starved both in
Body and Soul, if we had not so kind a Father, and so loving a Brother,
perpetually making Intercession for us. It behooves us therefore to be very
heedful that we wilfully displease not this gracious Father, and loving
Brother, by preferring the meat that perishes before that super-substantial
Bread of Life which came from Heaven, and was broken for our nourishment here
upon earth; and may be obtained for asking. We ought to take heed also, that we
dishonor him not as our First-Parents did by believing his Enemies, or by
seeking to them, or to such false gods as men often make unto themselves, or
seek unto him by Saints or Angels (not by him accepted for Mediators) to obtain
our needful Requests, to the undervaluing of his Sons Mediatorship, lest when
we stand in greatest need, his, and our Father justly turn us away in
displeasure, as he did the Israelites to those Idols: in whom they trusted.

2. Then, whereas it is said, Give us this day our daily bread, I take notice
from these words this day, that we are every day obliged to make our Addresses
to God, for such things as are daily needful* which the Emphasis of the said
words imply; as also, that according to our Saviors counsel, we should not
perplex our selves with a vexatious caring for the time to come, in regard
every day brings care enough to provide for the necessities thereof. Ye the
intended not thereby, that we should be negligent, in adding our endeavors to
Gods providence, he offering opportunities, honestly to enlarge his gifts
beyond the present days want; on in laying up that surplusage to make provision
for future necessities and contingencies, or for those of our Relations, or
others who are unable to provide for themselves, or of getting wherewithal to
distribute relief to them, for whose sakes he does make us his Stewards, in
that which he gives over and above our daily bread: For it is the Will of God,
that we should make use of the present day, without vexations care; to husband
well our Talents and Callings; to improve Gods daily Blessings, not only to
supply our personal necessites; but that we might have somewhat also of that
which God gives us over and above our daily Bread, to be dispensed by our hands
to those whom he intends to relieve by our charity, in imitation of his
Universal Love, who vouchsafes Rain both on the just and unjust, and expects
(though we should be merciful in the first place to them of his household) that
in their extreme wants, we should extend our charity even to the worst of men:
And we find by experience that benefits and kindnesses to those who knew they
had deserved none from us, but the contrary rather, do work sometimes more upon
them toward the reformation of their manners, then Reproofs or good Counsel:
For, though we are not to give holy things, or the Childrens bread to Dogs; yet
they who seem worthy of no more regard then Dogs, are not utterly to be
neglected, (because many of them have a precious Seed in them hidden from
others) as appears by the Canaanitish woman, who besought him for her daughter
vexed with a Devil, and by his deportment toward her; for, after his Disciples
had affronted her with disrespect, and he provoked her by making show of
neglect also; yet he granted her desire with a singular approbation of her
Faith, John 15. 22. We enough likewise to be heedful, that not so much as the
Crumbs or Fragments of what God gives us, may be cast away; or spoiled by our
negligence or improvidence, when we our selves are full; because* the least of
his Mercies are precious* and that which we despise may be both comfortable and
acceptable to some; therefore, our Savior commanded the broken meat remaining
of those few Loaves and two Fishes, where with he had fed so many thousands
should be gathered up, that nothing might be lost.

3. I observe from this word Give, that we must not only expect what we ask
for of free gift as aforesaid, and not as merited, but crave it in humility
also, as needy beggars ought to do; for, a proud beggar is abominable, and few
will given an Alms to him, that asks with insolence and pride; nor will
beggars always ask that with much respective meekness, which they know is
absolutely due unto them, and unjustly detained. This Benediction, Blessed are
the poor in spirit, implies with what sense of our nakedness, and with what
spiritual poverty of mind, we ought to petition our Father; and these words
annexed, Theirs is the Kingdom of heaven, Matthew. 5. 3. demonstrate that there
is no humane Rhetoric more prevalent with him. They will most humbly pray,
most diligently seek, and most earnestly knock (that is, do all things justly
pertinent to an obtaining of what they want) who know the supplying of their
defects, must proceed merely from the Bounty or Charity of the Giver; and that
he who will not endeavor for his daily bread, so far forth as he is able, when
he wants it, is not privileged to eat by the Apostles Rule and Practice; and
what can we do less toward it, then humbly to ask it? The same Apostle, though
he did perform the works of his Ministry freely (for which things necessary
were due from them whose benefit was thereby intended) wrought with his own
hands to supply what was wanting, rather then he would be over burdensome; or
take ought from them, who despising his Ministry, made themselves unworthy to
be numbered among his Benefactors. He to whom we are hereby taught to pray,
never neglects to give his Children what they have need of, unless it be to
prevent or cure some other Defects, which would have worse consequences, then
the lack of some necessaries for a while: And though he then lets us to bite on
the Bridle, yet when be finds us to be so sensible of our defects, that we
reslove to seek unto him, he meets us as did the Prodigal Sons Father, and is
ready to give before we ask. I was young, and am now older then David was, yet
can say as truly as he, I never saw the Righteous forsaken, or their seed
begging bread: That is, I never saw them so forsaken, as to be left so
comfortless in their greatest wants, to make begging their refuge as common
beggars do, resolving to live Idly by begging or Healing only. Such, for the
most part are extremely wicked in their lives and conversations; Cursers,
Swearers, Malicious, Envious, Railing and Snarling at each other, where they
attend for Alms, like Dogs quarrelling for bones, yea, grumbling and returning
currish language, even to those who relieve them, if they answer not their
unreasonable expectations. Yet, these must not be so neglected as they are, but
(as David counsels) wisely to be considered, not only to preserve them from
perishing, who are unable to provide for themselves, but to provide means
whereby they who are unable to work, may not live in fluttish idleness and
carelessness; for, our heavenly Father, denies nothing to any of his Children,
but when he knows they ask it, to be continued in idleness, or to satisfy
their lusts rather then to employ it to his honor and the comfort of their
brethren, according as they shall be able. He feeds the Fowls of the Air,
though they neither Plow nor Sow; but, they seek their meat according to the
means which he has given them so to do; he likewise Clothes the Lilies and
Flowers of the Fields with glorious colors; but they, without resistance of
his Will, are passive (though not active) in permitting providence to act upon
them what he pleases toward their vegetative being and adorning; in which
respects, they are instanced (as I conceive) for a symbolical representation of
that absolute obedience, which is in the Saints, and in those Seeds of Grace,
which are in them to fructify for Gods Glory, and toward their own perfection.

4. Moreover, the Emphasis which I apprehend to be in these words, this day,
hints unto us, not only this Caution, that we take all lawful opportunities to
improve Gods daily Blessings, and to dispense our Charity as occasions are
offered; but also, not to defer it until another day; because we know not what
shall be to morrow; or whether we have one other day to live. Many fair
advantages are lost by procrastination, never to be recovered; and yet through
want of consideration, many often defer the doing of their duties, when they
have neither less nor more benefit thereby; which demonstrates their
sottishness, who are thereto inclinable. By those words in the Original, which
are interpreted Daily bread, I understand all things whatsoever to be thereby
intended, and included, which are pertinent to the preservation of our Souls
and Bodies; for Bread is called the Staff of Life; and if I thought it needful
to be evidenced by particular Texts, I could make it appear that not only all
external necessaries are by holy Scripture intended by Bread, but that the
spiritual nourishments of our Souls are called the Bread of Life. Yea, Christ
Jesus, said of himself, I am the Bread of Life, which came down from Heaven;
whereof if any man eats, he shall live for ever; and, the Bread which I will
give it my Flesh, which I will give for the Life of the world, etc. I cannot
therefore think, when he prescribed this From of Prayer, but that he intended
we should ask this Bread, rather then the Common-bread, or such outward things
as are thereby signified; for doubtless, he who knew what most concerned us,
did principally intend this Bread should be prayed for, as that, which will
bring with it all other things necessary, both for our temporary and
everlasting well-being. But O God! how many of us do mind so much eartbly
material Bread, and those other things which flesh and blood are most affected
withal, (when we offer up this Petition) that we have no thought of that
Bread, which must preserve our souls and bodies to eternal Life! How few care
to know or heed what is contained in this precious Catholicon! And how is it
neglected and underprized, as a Form of Prayer fitting none but Idiots and
Children, even by some pretending to Piety! I take in, and put forth, that
which is offered by Meditation upon this Prayer, as it comes into my heart, and
not remembering all that I have written, may perhaps insist other while more
then once upon the same Notions and Cautions; but, that I hope shall not be
excepted against, for such Iterations are very frequent in the writings of the
Prophets, yet not impertinent, in regard as well our heedlesness of what is
spoken, as the various occasions thereof makes them useful.

The fifth Petition.
And, forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.
1. THis Petition is joined to the next before it, by the Conjunction
Copulative AND, as this is also, to the last Petition by the same Copulative;
from whence I collect, that it would be he little to Our long-lasting comfort,
to ask and obtain our Daily bread, unlels our sins are also forgiven; and that
we should quickly forfeit again our pardons, and be in a worse condition then
before; though we had plenty of all temporal and spiritual provisions prepared
and set before us, unless we shall be likewise preserved in all temptations
from those evils which may else ensue, when we abuse external benefits, and
saving means, to the dishonor of the Giver, either by neglect, or employing
them to fulfill our wicked lusts; or by turning his spiritual Graces into
wantonness. Giving and Forgiving, Pardons and Protections must go together in
completing our happiness; for, flesh and blood is so frail, that, without Gods
preventing Grace, and perpetual coassistance, we are sometimes prone to make
even the forgiveness of our sins, an introduction to a returning with the Dog
to his vomit, and with the Swine to wallowing in the mire; as appears by the
impudence of that Harlot mentioned by Solomon, who made the payment of her
vows, a motive to allure her lascivious companions to be partners in her
uncleanness: And it has been too often seen, that many (young persons
especially) who are persuaded, they are sanctified by a formal communicating at
the Lords Table about the time of Easter, do take more liberty that day to
fulfill their vain lusts, then on any one day in the year* and yet some of
these are none of those who make least conscience of Moral or Divine Duties.

2. That Word in the Original, which is translated DEBTS, signifies Trespasses
or sins also; Omissions and Commissions, leaving that undone, which we ought to
do; and doing that which we ought not to do. There is also in this Petition a
Condition employed, beside that which is expressed touching our forgiving them,
who are indebted or offensive to us; which condition includes Contrition,
Confession, Repentance, and Amendment, making up one fourfold Duty, without
performance whereof (in will at least) we cannot justly ask that pardon here
prayed for. Forgiveness of our Debts and Trespasses is not precarious, but on
condition we forgive them, who Trespass against us; And if it be so, they ought
seriously to consider how far they are from performing it as they ought to do,
who persecute their brethren or others to the ruining of their estates, and the
destruction of their lives; who seek their weal, and never did or intended them
evil; especially they who persecute others for differing from them in judgment
and practice only, in things relating to their conscientious serving of God,
whereof none but he himself is a competent Judge. These are far from imitating
God in his free Acts of Grace, as are they also who make shows of
Reconciliation and forgiveness, to get the more power and opportunity, to
execute their Vengeance upon those whom they hate without just cause. But, I
return to the forementioned conditional Duty. He that says he has no sin, is a
liar, and has no truth in him. He that hides his sin shall not prosper; He
that is not sorry for it, cannot truly Repent; He that Repents not, is
incapable of Remission; and if he might obtain it without Repentance; no
Amendment would follow; but, he would every day wax so much worse rather then
better, that at last he would fall into a final obduracy, rendering him
impenitent for ever. This fourfold Duty I make to be but one, because if one be
sincere, all the rest are so truly performed together in one moment effectually
(though it be in the last hour of life) that they will be accepted of, as if
actually done from the Womb to the Grave; as appears by our Saviors gracious
words to the Thief upon the Cross; and by him who received the whole days
wages for one hours work: for, though our sins are so many and unknown, that,
we cannot confess, be sorry for them, or repent them all in particular, yet
their being so many, may and ought to make us to repent them in general, with
the more hearty sorrow and confession, and then our willingness to amend shall
be accepted for the deed; through that satisfaction which was made for all our
transgressions, by him who has satisfied to the plenary Remission of all our
Debts and Trespasses, who shall ask it in his Name with Faith and Love.

3. That, this Faith and Love may be attained unto, we must with David
earnestly desire and endeavor to have our hearts and Reins searched, that out
secret sins may be discovered unto us, as much is as possible, and consider
from what ^osome Serpents we are delivered by the sacrificing of that Lamb,
which takes away the sins of the World; for, in the heart lies the root of all
Transgressions; which (though mortified by Christ's taking upon him our Nature)
is in every unregenerate man, soon quickened again, by the spirit of the Devil;
and the evil seed by him injected is conceived, nourished, and delighted in, by
filthy contemplations, until it comes forth into deeds: and, though never
perhaps, brought forth into Act, defiles as much (if not more) then actual
Adulteries and Murders; because spiritual wickednesses, occasioning no outward
shame or punishment, bringing us to heed and repent them (as open gross sins
do) are by so much the more dangerous and mortal To kindle and inflame our Love
to Christ, and that our Faith may take the faster hold on him; we might to take
notice that he has Redeemed us, and all mankind from every sin whatsoever;
lest by denying him the honor of that Mercy, (which is the greatest
illustration of his Love) we commit a greater sin then all those that we desire
should be forgiven: and let us be wary that we charge not the humane Nature
with a sin wherewith God charges it not, in such a manner as some do, under a
pretense of doing him honor thereby. Thus, ignorantly, they do at least, if
not Hypocritically, who impute the guilt of Original sin, to all Mankind; For,
I cannot understand to what end they should impute the guilt of our first
Parents transgression to all, except it be to lay un to Gods charge the chief
cause and greatest blame of all our Prevarications, according to their c^vil,
who said, The Childrens teeth were set on edge by their Fathers eating of sour
grapes, whereof they tasted not; and were made liable to everlasting death, by
their transgressions, before they had any sin of their own. This is the effect
of those words, and this misimputation to God, is continued, though he has
said, (yea sworn) the contrary, and reproved the Jews (whose imitators and
parallels we have been in all their sins): for many have the very same evil
opinion of Gods Justice and Mercy. This makes me think, when I hear what some
say to this purpose, in their confessions, that, they do but complement with
God in their Prayers, as they do, who being suitors to a great person, say to
this effect: Sir, we are your poor humble servants, who have often offended
your honor; and are so unworthy that we can justly expect nothing, but of your
mere favor, etc. yet when they come to speak of this person to others; say, He
is a hard man, reaping where he sowed not; gathering where he strowed not;
making him pay for that which others bad eaten; promising that for believing,
which he had disabled them to believe, and punishing them for that fault, which
he knew others had committed; with such like scandalous and injurious
imputations. This, God knows, some say of him; and who that considers it, can
hope without repentance of this blasphemy, to offer any Petition to him for
himself or others, that shall not be rejected with a malediction? Or, who can
expect, that Pestilences, Wars, Famines, Persecutions, Seditions, Rebellions
and uncharitable censures of each other can be prevented, or abated, where many
men have such an opinion of God? and are so wicked as to require his
upspeakable Love and long-sufferings, with such indignities, to whom, he
vouchsafed more mercy, then to the elapsed Angels, though his Justice was
extended in perfection, even to them also.

4. They were not created of any mutable matter; and having no Tempter without
themselves as Adam had, they might all as well as part of them did, have
continued in uprightness, had not self-love declined them from their Maker,
which it may be was the cause, they had no Redeemer decreed or promised. But
Adams body being formed of changeable Elements, (having also a subtle malicious
Tempter to corrupt his innocence) God in Mercy provided him a Savior; who
took away the guilt of that Transgression, both from him, and from all his
Posterity; making a gracious Covenant whereby all might possibly have been
preserved to eternal life. For, though the first sin, had so tainted those
Vessels, through which all Mankind was to descend, that it was thereby subject
to many infirmities, and inclinable to all manner of Prevarications, those
disadvantages were fully recompensed with a grant of more by the Mediatorship
of Christ Jesus, then was lost by Adams; if the Grace vouchsafed be improved as
it may be, and not wilfully neglected by degrees, till increased to a malicious
contempt thereof, so hardening the heart, that neither Judgments or Mercies can
soften it. According to David's confession in the 91. Psalm, we were by our
First-parents begotten and conceived in sin, and thereby contracted a natural
disableness to do any good of our selves, through that proneness to evil, which
is inherent Nevertheless, we have no such cause to complain as is pretended:
For there, is in the moment of our natural conception a spiritual seed,
conceived in our hidden parts (as to me seems expressed in that Psalm) by the
Spirit of God; applying the Virtue of Christ's Incarnation to our Nature, and to
the sanctifying of it at the reception of our humane Essence, that the seed
then cast into us might fructify, and that such a clean heart and right spirit
might be formed in us, as David prayed for: which, else he could not have
prayed for in Faith, or sincerely acknowledged Gods having wrought in him such
a spiritual work, that he might have had hope of a Regeneration thereby,
notwithstanding his personal infirmities; but would rather have extenuated his
transgressions, by charging God with leaving him in an incapacity to avoid that
disablement which he had from our First parents, rather then have justified (as
in that Psalm he does) the Truth of God in all things by him spoken, by
whomsoever he should be censured with a Righteous Judgment: For, it is no
derogating from God (as some think) and an ascribing to our selves more then
belongs unto us, but an honor to him rather (by saying the fault of all our
misdoing upon our selves) to acknowledge his free gift, and to say we have our
natural will, by him so renewed and freed, that we have a will by him free to
choose Good or Evil, when he sets them before us: in regard, it is but a mocking
of men, when we offer them a mercy, or any other benefit upon such a condition,
as we know they cannot perform; and a palpable injustice to condemn men for
that offense, which they never did in their own persons, (especially when
satisfied for by their surety) so far forth, as it related to them; and I know
none, who in heaven or earth will justify such an action when it comes to be
judged. Or, if we may not acknowledge, that God has given us some faculties,
which are properly called our own when freely given, whereby we may do what he
requires; or if we shall be condemned for what we never had a possibility
personally to perform; I cannot understand how we can so justify God to our
humane Capacity, that he will not be rather feared as a Tyrant, then honored
as so gracious a King ought to be: for this is not an adhering to Reason in
ought repugnant to true Faith, as has been ridiculously objected; but
agreeable to that which is warranted both by Nature and Grace: And whilst a
contrary belief is cherished by Professors of Piety, as pertinent to the honor
of God, and to the abasement of our selves, I shall not wonder if the words and
promises of Earthly Kings, be reputed sacred, though they perform nothing
accordingly; for it is just that they should suffer by such Retaliations, who
have so ill an opinion of God, as is before expressed; seeing he has not only
made us many gracious promises, and faithfully performed them from Generation
to Generation; but made way also to reconcile us unto himself, when we were his
Enemies, by satisfying that which Justice required, by the precious Blood of
bis beloved Son, in whom he is best pleased.

5. But, are none guilty now, of Original sin? Yes many; yea all men who
continue in their sins without repentance, and fight not against their natural
corruptions, which (as it is said of Hydras heads) spring again as fast as cut
off; and they especially are guilty thereof, who sin wilfully and maliciously,
as appears by what is imprecated against such offenses in the 109 Psalm,
which is a Prophecy against Judas, and suchlike Transgressors: For, it is
usual with the Prophets to express in the imperative Mood, and by way of
Prayer, those Benedictions which God has decreed and promised to the
Righteous, arid to predict by way of Imprecation those maledictions which are
to be the portion of Reprobates; as in the forementioned Psalm, where it is
said in relation to such an Offender, and to the Children, of that wicked seed,
whereby he and they are propagated, Let the Iniquity of his Father, be
remembered with the Lord, and let not the sin of his Mother be blotted out. Let
his Children be continual Vagabonds, etc. that is, Let such as are sprung from
that seed of Malignity and Infidelity, which was in that malicious one, be so,
or so accursed. If it shall be asked, how any man may justly be charged with
Original sin, if all men were acquitted form it, as I have affirmed by Christ;
An unquestionable Answer thereto, I collect from the Parable in the 18th.
Chapter of St. Matthew, where the Kingdom of Heaven is likened to a King, who
calling his Servants to account, one was brought, that owed him a thousand
Talents, w^ ^ot having where with to make payment, was adjudged to be sold with
all that he had for payment of the Debt. The Servant thereupon fell down at his
feet, beseeching his patience and forbearance; which so moved the King to
compassion, that he forgave the whole Debt. The same Servant going out of the
Kings presence, finding one of his Fellows, who owed him but a hundred pence,
took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owe me; and though his
Fellow Servants fell at his feet, promising payment, if he would with patience
forbear him; he nevertheless cast him into Prison, which so offended the King
his Master, being informed thereof, that he delivered him to the Tormenters, to
be by them detained until he had paid all the Debt, which was formerly
forgiven; it being a Fundamental Maxim in the Law of that Kingdom resembled by
this Parable, That such measure as men mete, shall be measured unto them; and
that, they shall not be forgiven, who will not forgive their Brethren and
Fellow servants who trespass against them. In this Case, that Original debt,
which is remitted to every man by Christ's Incarnation and Passion, is charged
again upon every man who comes into this world, if he shall be then unmerciful
to his Fellow Servants, and sin wilfully and maliciously against the Grace of
God without repentance.

6. This I believe, as in relation to Original sin, and that before expressed to
be an Implicit Condition in all Gods Acts of Grace intended, though not
expressed, and more unalterable then the Laws of the Medes and Persians
heretofore. But in the close of this Petition, it is explicitly mentioned, and
therefore (...) be doubted of any, the words being plainly these, As we forgive
them, that trespass against us; And in the two Verses next following this
Prayer, it is declared both Affirmitively and Negatively by Christ himself, to
make us the more heedful thereof. If (says he) you forgive men their
trespasses, then will your heavenly Father also ford give you: But if you
forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you
your trespasses. It is said also, That we should be merciful as our heavenly
Father is Merciful, and perfect as he is perfect; which are such hard Lessons
to flesh and blood, that few love to hear of them, and perhaps that conditional
asking forgiveness aforementioned, had made so many neglect the Lords Prayer,
because they cannot so perfectly forgive, as they would be forgiven. But, they
mistake the meaning of the holy Ghost. God requires no impossible things at
our hands. He expects not such perfection in us as in him our Pattern, but
such a perfection of Imitation only, as we are capable of; and I hope those
Christians who (I know not to what good purpose) profess themselves to be
perfect, do not mean it in any other sense, then as to their being in the way
to perfection, and imitation of their pattern. No man who desire the Picture or
Image of his Friend, is so absurd as to look to have it more perfect then a
Representation can be. Some true resemblances may be expressed of the Body, the
Visage, Looks, Postures, of a Frown, a Smile, with suchlike, but little or
nothing of that wherein the perfection of the whole man consists. Therefore
the scrupling at this conditional Petition is causless. And I think it not so
difficult as some conceive it, for a man whose heart is regenerated to forgive
either his Brethren or Enemies, as he would be forgiven, or as Christ our
Pa^^orn did, according to our proportion of Charity; for, Stephen prayed for
his persecutors who stoned him to death; and perhaps, many supposed to be our
persecutors in mere malice, are either ignorant of what they do, as our Savior
said his Crucifiers were, or as Paul (who consented unto Stephens death) said
that he did all things with a good conscience toward Gods, even when he was a
persecutor, because, he thought those whom he persecuted to be blasphemers of
God. Yea, it seems so easy to forgive, as we desire God should forgive us,
that I, (who am one of the least in the Kingdom of Heaven) do believe (praised
be God for it, who knows I truly express my heart) can forgive my most
malicious Enemies, when I consider that the worst of them, for ought I know to
the contrary, may persecute me, either because he is an ignorant fool, or,
believes me to be an Enemy to the Truth of God, or to the public Peace: yea,
though I knew their persecutions proceeded from mere malitiousness, if I
perceived them affected with sorrow for it, and penitent for their trespasses
against other men; I could forgive them perfectly, though they had pursued me
to an inavoidable ignominious death; and weep for Joy of it, though since I was
of understanding, I could never weep for losses, reproaches, pains or
punishments occasioned by any open Enemy, but have often shed tears when
thereto moved, by compassion, kindnesses or unkindnesses of Friends and
Brethren.

7. Indeed, if all things were well considered, (and we had but so much
prudence or patience as we should have) it would not be difficult for any
rational man to forgive both Brethren and Strangers, Friends and Foes; for, in
whatsoever they trespass against us, they are seldom more mischievous unto us
then to themselves, when they intend best unto themselves, and worst to us.
Their injuries, reproaches, and despights to us, for the most part in some
respects or other, do us as much good as harm; and the benefits of the one, as
much disadvantages other while, as the mischiefs and scandals of the other;
for, they proceed but from fit, of complacency or anger, as occasions happen:
Sometime by Levity, sometimes by mistakes, ignorance or heedlessness, as well
as from malice; and sometimes an accidental toy, makes those who for many years
together lived in such hatred, that they watched all opportunities to destroy
each other, to become very kind Neighbors; and they who seemed as long a time
so mutually endeared, that they could not be absent a whole day, have outlived
all that friendship, and for a trifle been the greatest enemies in the world to
each other till their lives ended, the friendship or enmity of most, men in
these times, is neither worth our esteem or anger; for they who profess most
kindness when they are together, Jeer each other as soon as departed, and tattle
as contumeliously to their mutual disparagement in secret, as enemies do
openly; and no wise man will much more be troubled at what these either say or
do, then at the bawlings and snarlings of Dogs, if he can keep them from his
Shins; for within a short time, they with all their evil words and actions will
be buried in the earth, and quite forgotten, as we shall all be ere long also;
Therefore, let us all forgive one another.

8. I have yet more to say touching forgiveness. It appears not to me, that any
man can rationally expect forgiveness, either from God or men without
Repentance; or, that we are by precept obliged to forgive those, who continue
in a malicious impenitency, or that God has manifested any ground of hope, for
such as wilfully persevcre in trespassing: or who are inexorable to others
offending against them. By our Saviors answer to Peter (when he asked him, how
often he should forgive his Brother?) Repentance appears to be a conditional
Motive to Forgiveness, For, said he, Matthew. 18. 22. I say not until seven
times, but until seventy times seven times, a certain number for an uncertain.
And Lake 17. 3. he ssid, If thy Bother trespass against thee rebuke him, and if
he repent forgive him; and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day,
and seven times in a day turn again, saying, I repent, thou shall forgive him;
from whence collect (besides this, that we must both forgive others, and repent
our own sins, if we expect forgiveness) that, Repentance is always premised
before Forgiveness, both in relation to God and men. Now, it is to be
considered, that if as is aforsaid, God requires us to forgive our brethren
upon Repentance, though he offends us 490 times, numerus certus pro incerto,
that is, how often soever, we may undoubtingly believe, that God whose Mercy is
infinitely extended over all his works (and is not so severe as to mark all
that is amiss) will not heed humane failings with less compassion, then he
expects in men; or, that he looks for a more absolute Repentance then frail men
are able to perform; or, that he has not provided an extraordinary means by
Grace to supply all the defects in Nature, where the ordinary means is not
vouchsafed. Were it not so, we who have enjoyed the largest means in ordinary
(knowing what we are privy to in our selves) could not so absolutely depend
upon that imputative Righteousness which we have by Christ, as we do, or may
do; nor sincerely believe what we profess. Verily, God is so merciful, that he
acceppts of very imperfect Repentances and Humiliations, as appears by what he
vouchsafed to Ahab for a little outside-repentance; and how gracious he has
been from time to time, to those Nations who formally professed his Name,
though they have turned his Grace into wantonness, and more provoked him, by
their Hypocrisies and impudent abominations every day increasing, then all
those heathenish Nations which are by most of them reputed Reprobates, and
without hope or sense of their miserable condition. But, I believe many
millions who are thought totally excluded, shall, according to our Saviors
saying, Matthew. 8. 11. Come from the East, and West and sit down with Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob, in the Kingdom of Heaven, when the Children of the Kingdom,
shall be shut out, who think themselves to be the sole Inheritors thereof.

9. This has started those considerations which incline me at present, to
express what I further apprehend and believe concerning Gods eternal Love to
Mankind, to vindicate his Justice and Mercy from the dishonor done thereunto
by those who think he decreed-the greatest number to condemnation before the
Creation of the world; and I will not omit what I have to say in opposition
thereto, though probably I shall be judged an Heretic for my reward; and
perhaps be forsaken of many seeming Friends, as Christ was by some of his
Disciples, when he spoke that, which they were notable to bear. The utterance
of such Mysteries he forbore until the time came wherein to be silent, would
have occasioned greater inconveniences and mischiefs then to speak them; and
then he declared what was seasonable. This is also a time for me to express
what I have hitherto concealed more with respect to others then to my self; and
I will now declare it, lest if I let slip this opportunity, now GODS correcting
Angel, is under my Roof, I may not perhaps live to express it, if now neglected.

10. There are many places in holy Scripture so generally observed, that I need
not particularize them, from whence it is inferred, and vulgarly believed, that
a very small number shall be saved; which I conceive to be a false Inference
insinuated by the Devil to the dishonor of Gods Justice, Mercy, Wisdom and
Power: For, what can more blemish GODS Justice and Mercy, or magnify the
wisdom and power of the Devil more, then to have it believed, that he shall
carry away with him at the last Judgment, a greater number with him into Hell,
then Christ shall with him into Heaven? For, who is reputed a Conqueror, but
he that leads most out of the Field (of those who fought under his Banner) when
the Battle is ended? I need allege no more to reasonable men, if this be well
considered; but Reason is cried down as an Impostress, and therefore I must
proceed further to convince an error so generally received. It is true, that
during this great Week of the World, consisting of six Mystical days) now
having almost completed a thousand years apiece, according to the vulgar
computation) the Devil has so prevailed by Gods permission, that the extent of
Evil may be thereby fully known during the time aforesaid: God was likewise
pleased during the same time, to leave his Elect Subjects (except in extreme
streights and hazzards) furnished with no more Power and Ammunition then might
sufficiently maintain such a defensive and offensive War, as they were to be
employed in, to make proof how much, or how little advantage, could be gotten
by their Righteousness and Power, to bring them to the knowledge of that Good,
which has no Evil mixed therewith; and wherein, the perfection of their
happiness consists; as also, to give them an experimental knowledge of that
Evil, which our First parents desired to know. But, when the Sabbath of a
thousand years is come, wherein the Spiritual City of God shall descend from
Heaven, to restore Mankind to that Paradisical life, from which they have been
hitherto kept by an Angel brandishing a Sword every way; Satan, shall be so
bound, and his Policy and Power so restrained, that he shall add fewer to his
kingdom then now, or heretofore, when his Tyranny was permitted to be
prevalent; yea, perhaps he shall then get none to adhere finally unto him,
though his power not being totally restrained, he shall have liberty to deceive
the Nations for a while to evidence his own weakness, and the Power of Christ
when he personally assumes his Throne. During the six thousand years
aforegoing, wherein Satan had liberty permitted to exercise his Tyranny, so
far forth as might sufficiently demonstrate the effects of Evil as aforesaid,
God was not only able to raise up Stones to be Spiritual Children to Abraham,
as Christ said; but also did so, and does still raise up many, (that is, men
who are as unactive toward their own Salvation, as Creatures without life)
being insensible in our mode, of his operations upon them (and passive only as
Stones under the Work-mans Tools, without resisting the Spirits working upon;
and these are in the capacity of those little innocent Children, to whom Christ
said the Kingdom of Heaven appertains.

11. And, whereas we hear many such sayings as these, or to the like effect:
The way is broad that leads to destruction; and the Gate so straight which
gives admittance to Salvation, that few enter in thereat: That, many are
called, but few chosen: That, though the People were as the sands, of the Sea,
a small number should be saved: That, the Righteous in respect of the Wicked,
were but as here and there an Olive-berry upon the boughs after gathering-time;
or as a few Grapes after the Vintage, with suchlike asseverations; These, I
acknowledge to be true; yet my belief is, notwithstanding all this, that, a far
greater number shall be saved then condemned at the last Judgment. For, I
cannot; believe these expressions have respect to all Mankind dispersed
throughout the world, from the beginning to the end thereof, but as relating
comparatively to those only, who are and were Members of those visible
Churches and Provinces of Christ's visible Kingdom upon earth, to whom the
ordinary means of Salvation were and are dispensed, whether Jews or Christians;
the greatest number of whom (for their wilful neglect of that means, for their
turning the Grace of God into wantonness, for their seeking gain by pretended
Godliness, and for their mere formality and hypocrisy) shall be shut out of
that Kingdom, whereof they judged themselves to be sole Inheritors, and all the
rest of the world to be cast-aways. So did many Jews believe of themselves
heretofore; and so do many Christians now, who will at last find it to be a
spirit of self-love, which possessed them, producing no better fruit then the
Apples of Sodom are said to be. These, as I conceive, are those of whom the
sayings in holy Scripture aforementioned shall be verified, and of whom only
they were intended. These reputing themselves the only Children of the
Kingdom, boast of their Privileges; such, as the having Abraham to their
Father: The Temple of the Lord; or the Word and Sacraments of the Gospel among
them, how much soever abused or neglected; and these alone are concerned, in
those places of holy Scripture which declare the paucity of that number who
shall be chosen in comparison of them who are called; and the paucity of those
among them who shall be saved, in respect of their numerousness, who shall
perish by their neglecting or abusing those advantages which were put into
their hands, I conceive to be thereby meant: For, I cannot think that such
sayings had a purposed relation to them unto whose knowledge that means neither
came, nor was likely to come whilst they lived after they were born into the
World: Such in particular, as are many millions of Heathens in the remotest
parts of the world: As also, little Children dying before they are capable of
understanding what they hear; and who must inavoydably, and everlastingly
perish, if God has provided no other means of their Salvation by Christ then
such a way of preaching it as is vouchsafed to us.

12. Therefore, in my judgment, they should have little hope of pardon for
their many actual transgressions, who knowing God has provided means of life
and nourishment for Children in the Mothers Womb, when they can neither breath
nor eat, as when they are born; if they shall not believe that God who is
infinite in Mercy, has not provided as sufficient a means to nourish their
Souls and Bodies to eternal Life, who by Death in their infancy or otherways,
are (without their personal default) incapable of the ordinary means. It is in
my understanding, so great an injury to the Goodness and Mercy of God, to
affirm he has exposed to everlasting destruction all those Innocents by
leaving them totally without remedy, that they seem to me incapable of
Forgiveness, through Gods Mercy to them, until they repent of their blasphemous
mis-belief of his Fatherly compassion, who has given them no just cause to
imagine he neglects to make provision for the welfare of all his impotent
Children. Therefore, that we may not obstruct the Forgiveness of our Debts and
Trespasses, which we pray for, or charge God with so much cruelty, as to expose
his own Children, by Creation at least, to be a prey to the Devil; and which is
more abominable, to teach other men to believe be has eternally decreed the
Reprobation of all Mankind, except a very few in comparison of the rest: I
will endeavor to make it more evident, though I have alleged much to this
purpose already, that a very few shall be everlastingly damned, in respect of
them who shall be saved by the Mercy of God in Jesus Christ; and that this is
sufficiently provided for, by GODS eternal Decree of Election and Reprobation,
which has by many been misunderstood to the dishonor of his Divine Justice:
contrary to the light of Reason renewed and santified by Grace, and to that
illumination, which is added thereunto, by Gods Word and Spirit. And, though to
make odious that Doctrine which I assert, it is called Heresy, Arminianism,
Popery, and what else they please who oppose it; I hope it shall be so
generally received, that all good Christians will ere long, be ashamed of it,
and make it appear so wicked, that it will hardly be believed by many in future
times, if there were not so many great Volumes written to uphold their error.
For, who in Reason can believe, that he who created all things in Love, by
Love, and to be beloved of his Creatures, for whose good he created them, did
fore-intend to make the greatest number of them everlastingly miserable; and
design them to that unhappiness, before they had being, or possibility to do
good or evil; yea, that he necessitated them to do that evil for which they
should be condemned? what love was there in this? or what love could be expect
from those who should be taught thus to believe? or, what Truth is in such
Teachers who encourage their Disciples, to think so of him who has said and
sworn, he desired not the Death of sinners, but that they should repent and
live? Verily, if there be any madness in Bedlam, more extravagant then this, I
am greatly deceived.

13. It is true, that God has absolutely predestined some to Salvation, and
ordained some to condemnation of old, with respect to their Qualifications in
time, and to a Covenant between him and them; but none absolutely to
condemnation, nor either with respect or disrespect to their persons before
time, or before they had a temporary being; though he fore-knew what the one
and the other would be. David tell us in his fourth Psalm who they are whom God
Elected; even the GODLY; that is, such as he foresaw would hear, heed and be
conformable to the dictates of his Word and Spirit; and who when he had
enlightened their understanding, and renewed their wills, would endeavor
perseverance to the end according to the power he gave them, not trusting to
that obedience, or to any Righteousness of their own thereby acquired; or
seeming to be formerly inherent, but to Gods Free Grace only; who, when men
have once given him their hearts, thereto allured by loving compellations,
never afterward fails to keep them to himself, maugre all the frailties of the
flesh, or the temptations of the World and the Devil, because, Whoomsoever he
once loves, he loves to the end; These are they who were from eternity
Elected and given out of the world to Christ by his Father, and for whom he
prayed that none of them might be lost: when these have chosen God for their
only refuge; taken up his secret place for their Habitation, and can say unto
him in their hearts with David, Psalm. 91. Thou art my Shield, my Fortress, and
him in whom I trust, etc. he will give his Angels charge to keep them in all
their ways, that neither open or secret fears or perils shall affright or
endanger them, though thousands and ten thousands fall round about them: Though
these may be exposed to temptations by prosperity or adversity, they shall be
carried through them with safety and honor; though they walk among Adders and
Lions (that is, live among subtle Seducers and tyrannous Oppressors) neither of
them shall have power to hurt them; but, they shall tread upon them with
contempt, and proceed on through all difficulties to the fruition of Eternal
Glory. These God has elected from before all worlds, without any mere personal
respect, until their Faith has qualified them for a personal respect in Christ
Jesus; and he has neither eternally reprobated, nor of old, ordained any man
to condemnation, but those only, who after they came into the world, should
incline wholly to the suggestions of the Devil, the inticements of the World,
and the lusts of the Flesh, wilfully and finally neglecting and despising that
means of their Salvation which God should offer unto them in the Ordinary way
of preaching it by his Word, by his Judgments and Mercies; or by the
extraordinary operations of his Spirit, in them who have not the ordinary means
to help them improve their single Talent of Reason, and the Light set up in
their own Consciences. By these Cords of love, the Father seeks to draw all
men to Christ; and though many of his Elected ones, are at first moved to come
unto him through self-love or fear, for their own sakes, they are so strong,
that, at last they draw all men unto him for his Love-sake, who loved them
first; except such only, as frowardly, and wilfully stop their ears, shut
their eyes, and harden their hearts, till he justly deprives them of their
hearing, sight and understanding, and gives them up to a Reprobate-sence,
because, they would not hear, see and understand when they might. These are
they, and they alone whom God may be said to Reprobate Eternally or of old; and
if he recals any who are thus far elapsed, it is more then he has promised to
do, for ought I know; and if he does so, his Mercy is his own, to confer when
and where he pleases, without wrong to any in so doing. And it is a Mercy that
he has not revealed ought whereupon to ground an absolute confidence of being
often called: For, it would be abused by most men, to the rendering them the
more presumptious and the more careless.

14. There are many false Inferences and absurd supposals drawn from Gods
foreknowledge and pre-election, whereby Learned men have deceived themselves
and others; because, they misconceive Gods Prescience and Election, as if he as
we do, considered things as being precedent, and subsequent to each other in
time, whereas, he being Eternal, all things past, present and to come, are
present with him as existing in one and the same moment: the ignorance or
heedlesness whereof; as also, of other suchlike verities, are the occasions of
other errors. Alas! what remedy, when Foundations are overthrown? A great
number of those who seem to be true Preachers of the Gospel of Christ, by a
conscientious undertaking of that Duty, being such as have brid'd themselves
into that sacred Calling, for preferment to those Dignities, wherewithal the
world has corrupted and profaned it; or else, to make a Trade of it whereby
to get a livelihood; have taken up Truth or Heresies, as they accidentally
stumbled upon them where they had their Education, endeavoring, to supply
their want of Spiritual Gifts, by such helps as mere humane Industry could
afford; adding thereto formal Austerity, Gravity, and shows of Piety, which
draw ignorant well-meaning heaters, to be Zealous in what they teach them, be
it right or wrong: And as their Disciples follow them, so they followed their
chosen Ringleaders in those Opinions which they happened upon, as Wilde-geese
follow their Leaders, whithersoever they fly. If the Goose that heads them is
wary, and having been acquainted with the profits and dangers of the Country,
carries them thither where they may feed and rest in safety, it is well; bur,
if he be such a Goose as minds only the filling of his Belly, neither heeding
the Nets, nor the Stalking-horse of the Fowler; both he, and the Goslings that
follow him, are in a Net, or the shot in their bowels before they are aware.
Thus it fares with many poor souls led by blind Guides and false Teachers, of
whose increase there is more likelihood, then of reducing Christian Doctrines
and Disciplines to their pristine purity, till the Kingdom of Christ shall come
into the earth: yet every conscientious man ought to contribute what he is able
thereunto in the mean time, and so will I.

15. Gods Frescience that such or such a thing will he done, does not therefore
necessitate, or cause the doing it, more then my knowledge that mortal men
shall dye, is the cause of their death; neither is it rightly inferred, or
justly to be concluded from Gods predestinating some absolutely to eternal
Life, that therefore all the rest were decreed absolutely to condemnation more
then it may be truly said, that when a King without any considerable condition
premised, pardons some of those who were guilty of the same offense with
others, that, he thereby employed all the rest should be executed without mercy,
when he, offers them pardon once, (and perhaps oftener) upon such conditions as
they were then able to perform; and still might have done, until they had
wilfully disabled themselves by long neglect or contempt of his Grace offered.
God, may do with his own what he pleases; and if he will give to one gratis,
for doing nothing, as much as he will to me for working according to my
Covenant; what wrong Bath he done to me whereof I may justly complain? or, if
he punished me, who both left that work undone, which I could and ought to have
done, and slandered also his Mercy and Justice, yet pardons another who is no
less culpable, why should I repine that he obtains Mercy, because I am justly
punished? In this, and suchlike Cases, it is that the Scripture says, God
has Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and hardneth whom he pleases; and, GOD
is no such accepter of persons as they misconceive him to be, who misapply that
Text wherein it is said, that GOD hated Esau and loved Jacob, before either of
them had done good or evil, and think it implies Esua's Reprobation; for though
Jacob being the third Patriark who was separated, or sanctified, to be the
Fore-father of Christ according to the flesh; and Esau in that respect, but a
common or profane person (and worthily lost his Birthright for selling it at
so base a price) yet that rejection as to the Election of being the person from
whom the Messiah should descend, warrants not me to aver that he was reprobated
in respect to the Salvation of his Soul; for those words (...) mentioned were
spoken perhaps, with regard to Gods foreknowledge of what he would do; or
rather (as I believe) with respect to the works of the flesh and of the Spirit
only; Esau being a Type of the one, and Jacob of the other, (as Sarah is said
to be of the Gospel, and Hagar of the Law) they being Progenitors of differing
Nations: For, the works of the Spirit are pleasing to God, and always loved of
him; and the works of, the flesh abominable, and by him hated both before, and
after they are done.

16. That Text is misunderstood also, to the dishonor of God, which mentions
a Potters power over his Clay, to make thereof a Vessel of honor or dishonor
as he pleases; For, though God has more power over his work then a Potter
over his Clay; yet, to infer positively from thence, that God had purposely
made some to be Vessels of wrath is an unjustifiable inference from that
allusion. And that obscure place of St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans where the
Potters freedom to make what Vessels he pleases out of one and the same Lump
is misunderstood to imply what is aforesaid; for, if it be so expounded by the
context, and other places of holy Scripture, that the whole and every part of
Gods Word may agree in one Truth, we shall never understand Paul's meaning as
some do, The holy Ghost alludes not our most wise Creator to a foolish Potter,
who, because he might make what he would of his Clay, did therefore make the
greatest number of his Pots to be broken again, to show he had as well a power
to break them as to make them; or, that only to evidence his displeasure,
without cause, he made them ugly and unserviceable. Doubtless, God so made all
things, that not one of his Creatures has so much cause of dislike as to say,
Why have thou made me thus? He is resembled to a wise Potter, who makes both
Vessels of honor and dishonor, out of the same Lump of Clay: no Vessels of
wrath came so made out of his hand; but every one a vessel useful for his
service, without, injury or grievance done thereunto. A Chamber Pot made for
that use, or a Pipkin to serve always in the Fire, are as well pleased to be
serviceable in their kinds, as drinking-cups and other Vessels employed at the
Table, though reputed more honorable then the former. The Literal words of
Scripture, may be (and in some places are) vitiated by the heedlesness of
Transcribers, as we perceive by differing Copies; yet the true Genuine sense
will be always found entire, and every part consonant to each other in the
truth, if read with submission to the dictates of that Spirit, which always
accompanies the same; and so are the Texts aforementioned.

17. I will add a few line more to declare, why I believe, as is aforesaid,
that God has predestined a far greater number to eternal Life, then he has
left liable to final Reprobation by their own default; and I beseech all my
Readers to peruse it with patience and without Prejudice; for no affectation to
singularity, but a conscientious Zeal to vindicate Gods honor, by illustrating
the infiniteness of his Mercy and Love to all Mankind, has inclined me there
unto. In my understanding, that which may be considered by contemplating Gods
Word in the spirituality thereof; he has, as it were distributed all mankind
into three Regiments, which have been governed by the invisible and visible
operations of the holy Trinity ever since the Creation, and during most part of
that time hitherto by the third Person, who still governs it, and shall until
Christ comes personally again upon earth. The first Regiment consists or all
those, who lived to be Members of the Visible Church made up both of the
natural and spiritual Seed of Abraham, as well under the Law of works as of
Faith; Jews and Gentiles; Hypocrites and true Professors. These in many
preceding Generations, were very few (and so they yet are in respect of the
rest, of Mankind; and were obliged to work out their a Salvation, by a
respective conformity to those Laws and Dispensations, which in their distinct
times and seasons, were vouchsafed in various modes; they who lived before
Christ came in the Flesh, in one manner, and they in another, who were to come
after that time; but, both one in Substance, though differing in Types,
Ceremonies, and other circumstances: For, we of the later time, cannot be
saved, but by believing in Christ Jesus the Son of God, conceived by the holy
Ghost, born of the Vigin Mary, etc. as, it has been revealed by the Apostles,
with those Attributes and circumstances contained in the Old and New Testament
relating to Christ's, Evangelical Kingdom; whereby both Jews and Gentiles(now
called Christians) are equally privileged and obliged. The Jewish outward
Duties, before Christ, consisted in observing and conforming to those Types and
Ceremonies, under which that was veiled, which we profess. They had the same
Christ for the Object of their Faith, and Worship, though so little known to
them according to the manifestations we have had, that very few, except their
eminent Prophets understood the Mysteries of his Kingdom; yet were saved by
being obedient thereto according to the measure of their understanding. These
together make up the Brigade of those Soldiers in the Church-Militant, who
fight the Battles of the Lord, against the enemies of his Kingdom; some, in
pure Love to him and his Cause; some, as Hirelings only for their Wages: And
they among them, who become faithful, continuing so to the end, shall be
Crowned with Victory and Glory above all other Saints; because, exposed to the
greatest sufferings and dangers in this Life. Now, though these will be a very
small number, in respect of that great number which consists of them who have
been either false Pretenders, Traitors, Apostates or unprofitable servants to
their General; yet, they are said to be as numberless as the Stars in the
Firmament: these are David's worthies, and as it were the Lifeguard of the
Kingdom, and a small Regiment compared unto the other two, whereof I am next to
speak. Yea, these are that part of GODS Elect to whom this saying has respect
Many are called, but, few are chosen: For, they are most properly said to be
called, who had either an outward Legal, Prophetical, or Evangelical Calling,
by the exemplary life of the Patriarchs; by the Law written in Stone; by the
teachings of the Prophets, or, by the Preaching of the Gospel, since Christ
came in the Flesh; by whom, very great numbers, have been called in every Age,
yet very few of them saved, in respect of so great a multitude of them, as have
neglected that Call, and turned the Grace of GOD into wantonness. And the word
MANY, makes it probable to me, that these are they, of whom but a few will be
saved of those many which are called in this manner: for I believe, that
(beside this external mode of calling many) there is an Universal internal
calling also, wherein are concerned with this, the other two Regiments also, of
those who shall be saved; and whereof, I am next to speak as aforesaid.

18. The second Regiment of Saints, consists of those without the Visible
Kingdom, who are Members of that Invisible Catholic Church, which is dispersed
throughout the World, and were from time to time brought into it, by the Spirit
of Christ preaching, as it it said, 1 Peter 3. 19. to those who are in prison;
that is (as I understand it) to them who surviving until the years of
discretion, have lived out their whole time in the shadows of Death, without
means of saving Light, by the Gospel preached as unto us. For, knowing what I
justly apprehend of Gods infinite Goodness and Mercy, I cannot believe he has
less effectually provided for their Salvation then for our; but, that he had
regard to them, even when the Visible Church seemed to extend no further, then
to the Families of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; to whom he spoke sometimes
immediately, otherwhile by Angels or by Dreams, as it is said, Job 33. in which
Chapter Gods secret way of Instruction, and communicating his will to men in
the night of their natural Ignorance is expressed, as also in relation to them,
where the ordinary means is wanting at this day, in Asia, Africa, and America.
For, though Faith was not heretofore, nor is now begotten in them by preaching
and hearing as with us, the Heavens and the Book of the Creatures, which was
open to the Magi at the time of Christ's birth, and directed them to him by a
Star (they not having Prophets to reveal him, as the Jews had) he might
possibly be discovered to others in some such extraordinary manner, as will be
available. For Jesus Christ, (without whom there is no Salvation, and who is by
St. Paul called the Mercy of God) may be laid hold upon by that Notion, through
the Sanctification which the whole humane Nature, received by his Incarnation,
and the supply contributed by his Spirit, who then took away their Original
guilt, and inlightens every man who comes into the world, may so perfect also
what is wanting of the Ordinary means, that many millions of those will be
brought to sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven:
Those passive Stones will be more easily hewed and polished to complete the
City of God, then the most part of those, who were, and are formally squared,
and polished by hired Work men. The effects which Gods Spirit alone, had upon
Abimelech in Abraham's time; upon the first Pharaohs; upon Nebuchadnezzar,
Cyrus, Darius, the wise men in the East, and some others without the Pale of
the Visible Church; as also, by the little good effect, which the ordinary
means of Grace has had upon the Kings, Priests, Prophets and People in the
Visible Kingdoms and Churches, of Jews and Christians throughout all
Generations, makes it seem probable to me, that, the secret teachings and
inspirations of the holy Ghost, improving and sanctifying the Talent of Reason,
will bring more thousands into Christ's Kingdom, then all the Priests and
Prelates throughout Christendom, by the mere external Forms, Disciplines and
Dispeosations among Jews and Gentiles, ever since they had being; by reason of
their abusing or neglecting the Grace therewith offered. And, if this be so, as
I believe it is; then these Regenerated by the Ministry of the holy Ghost,
being added to them, who through the Ordinary means, are made Abraham's Children
by Faith (whom God promised to make as numberless as the sands upon the
Seashore) will infinitely augment the number that shall be saved.

19. The third Regiment increasing this number, is that of Infants, two years
old and under, when taken out of this life. These, during that time are not
capable of doing either good or evil, not some of them in many years more; and
I think it were a barbarous faith to believe all these were born to make up the
Kingdom of the Devil. Our Savior said, That of such the Kingdom of Heaven
consisted, and reproved those who denied their access to him, saying, Suffer
such to come unto me, and rebuke them not, for of such is the Kingdom of God;
and perhaps, thereby implicitly employed, that it was a very offtensive error
in those who should believe little children were not absolutely Redeemed by
him, from the guilt and punishment dur for Original sin: And yet it seems, by
his Disciples rebuking those who brought them, that good men may be tainted
with this Heresy, which so much displeased Christ; that he afterward added
these words; Verify, I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of
God as a little Child, shall not enter thereinto, Mark 10. 13, 14, 15. So far
are they from being Excluded, that they are the Pattern of that absolute
resignation, which is required in all who may expect admission into Christ's
Kingdom. Some will say perchance, they must be the Children of the Faithful to
Whom this privilege belongs. I say the same; for I believe that every Child
born into the World, or conceived in the Womb, is the Seed of the Faithful,
when or wheresoever, it is or shall be born; for, in the 87 psalm, it is said,
God loves the Gates of Sion more then all the Habitations of Jacob; and by
what follows, that many who had their natural birth, in Rahab, Philistia, Tire,
Aethiopia, yea in Babylon, shall be reputed as born in the spiritual sion. And
it is not to be supposed, that a remoteness by Place or Time (though it were
longer then one thousand years, or farther off then the ends of the earth) are
any bar to the Influences of Divine Grace. All Children are the Seed of the
Faithful in Noah, though their immediate Fathers have been Infidels eyer since
Cham was born; and God promised to show Mercy to the thousandth Generation of
those who fear him and keep his Commandments. This also that follows, is very
considerable in relation to the Condition of Infants, that, they were the
first* who suffered for Christ, even when he being an Infant, Herod murdered
all the Children in Bethlem, and the coasts round about, Matthew. 2. 16. These,
being dipped, as it were into Christ's sufferings, and Baptized with the holy
Ghost and with Fire, may signify unto us, the Universal Redemption and
sanctification of all such from Original sin. These, and their infinite
multitudes, I do conceive to be intimated by the mystical number of A hundred
and forty four thousand, comprehending twelve times twelve thousand in a square
Root; for none can be more properly; termed Virgins not defiled with Women;
that is, polluted with Original guilt, whereof, every man born of a Woman had
been still culpable, if it had not been taken away by Christ; and wherewith all
men are again defiled and charged, who, when they come to understanding, sin
actualy without Repentance. These are the first Fruits to God and the Lamb,
preserved from Actual sins in word and deed, by being translated, soon after
they are born, to follow the Lamb into a better Life. Now, for God to Elect and
predestinate these, from Eternity, to be removed out of this world to
everlasting happiness, as soon as born, without exposing them to those
hazzards, which others are to undergo, (though upon conditions made possible to
be performed by his assisting Grace) is a great Mercy, without infringement of
his own Justice, or wrong to any other, (though they shall not have so much
honor as they who are to serve in the spiritual warfare, against the World,
the Flesh, and the Devil.) This Mercy is so agreeable to the pure Nature of the
Deity, that I wonder any man who knows any thing of God, should be so sottish
(yea so wicked) as to believe he had foredetermined the Reprobation of any
Infant incapable of doing good or evil in his own person.

20. The Preaching of Christ by his Spirit to those who are in the Prisons of
their Fleshliness, supplies many defects, both where the Ordinary means is
wanting, and where it is abused or neglected; else, the Foundations of Piety,
being so overthrown or nigh ruined as they are, by the Obstinacy and
Prevarications both of Jews and Gentiles, there would be little, or no hope of
preserving saving Faith, or so much as the seed thereof upon earth, until
Christ should come again. Thereby, the Seed of Abraham according to the Flesh,
must (if ever) be brought into Christ's Fold, and that fullness of the Gentiles
come in, which will accomplish the Salvation of the whole Israel of GOD, who
are the spiritual Seed of Abraham. And I think it not so strange as it seems to
many, that more should be this way, made partakers of the kingdom of Heaven,
then by the ordinary means of Salvation in the Visible Church, when I confider
what I experimentally know to be spiritually done, in perfecting natural works
and faculties. Art and Industry joined together, make few men of ripe Age and
Understanding, so perfect in the knowledge and use of any Language in many
years, as some Children are in one year, after they have but strength enough to
speak; though they are not capable of any Grammatical Rules or demonstrations:
for, some of them I have known to speak both properly, and otherwhile
facetionsly, before they either well knew what they did, or could define what
speaking is, or what they any word means by it self: And, there being nothing
in the nature of the words, which can of it self interpret what is meant by
them, it is no less wonderful that a little Child, should both understandingly
and affectionately apprehend his Fathers meaning; and express his own by them
(as we often hear them do) then that a heathenish Infidel should be made capable
of Faith by the Spirit of God without hearing the vocal Preaching of the Gospel
in our mode; for it is the same Spirit which teaches the one and the other.
Likewise, were it not so, it would puzzle the wisest man living, to demonstrate
how a man born deaf and dumb, should be capable of understanding what is
written, and of writing his own conceptions in such words as we speak and
write; (which it is known has been attained unto.) But doubtless, by the same
Spirit which first instructed Man to know the Course and Order of the Stars,
and how to read the knowledge of God in The Great Volume of his Creatures, with
the many secrets therein written; and the discovery of other Mysteries not else
attainable, was communicated by the same Divine Spirit. Now, if we know God
has often wrought supernaturally by his Spirit to teach us things pertinent to
our well-being in this transitory life; we may reasonably believe, that he much
rather operateth supernaturally where need is, toward our everlasting
well-being, without which the Blessings of this life will be Curses: Therefore,
I believe God has provided extraordinary means of Salvation, for every Soul
since the fall of Adam, which has not wilfully neglected and despised the
ordinary means of Grace when offered, or who never had it personally
vouchsafed; of which number are such Infants as aforesaid.

21. These Inlargements, not intended, dropped in by the ways, and it may be I
may seem Heretical in my judgment, especially touching what I have declared in
relation to a probability of having Faith wrought in those barbarous Heathens,
who never heard of the Jesus Christ conceived by the holy Ghost, born of the
Virgin Mary, and crucified under Pontius Pilate, etc. as we are taught, though
I make it not a necessary Article of Saving faith to be known and believed by
all men. I profess; I do believe as is before expressed; and having considered
every particular, especially that of Infants, do say (as Cicero said in his
Tract of the Immortality of the Soul, entitled Scipio's Dream) it seems so
pleasing an error, if it be one, and so comfortable a Doctrine, as well in
respect of many millions more, of our Progenitors, as of mine and their little
Children dying before years of Discretion, that, I think I shall never be of a
contrary Judgment; and chiefly, in regard of the honor which thereby redounds
to Gods Justice and Mercy; For when I have meditated how many millions of
millions will be added unto the innumerable sums comparehended in the first two
Regiments of the three aforementioned, by the last of them, consisting of
little Children, I do believe that the number of them who shall be saved, will
be as much greater, at least, then of those who shall be damned; as the number
of the wicked who lived in this world, shall be greater then that of those who
are conformable to the Will of GOD, preached in the Visible Church. And I am
assured this Belief is neither contrary to any Maxim in holy Scripture, not
likely to beget presumption in any, who was not hardened in sinning, before;
but, will rather make men the more awful of sinning against so great Mercy, and
the more mindeful, there is Mercy with GOD that he may be both feared and
loved. More might be said; but this being well needed, may be sufficient to
make reasonable men so merciful to each other, by Gods Exemplary Mercy, that
they may forgive as they would be forgiven, unless they are prepossessed with a
wilful and malicious Vengeance. Therefore I will for the present, here conclude
my Meditations upon this Petition, humbly beseeching our gracious Further which
is in heaven, so to incline our hearts to forgive all, who trespass against us,
that he may forgive all our trespasses against him, Amen.

The sixth Petition.
And lead us not into Temptation; But deliver us from evil.
1. THis, and the last preceding Petition, being annexed to the fourth by the
Copulative AND, as a foresaid, complete all things necessary to accomplish our
well-being in this Life. We stand in perpetual need, as to our external
happiness, of what is prayed for in these three last Petitions; and therefore
the Apostle exhorts us, to pray continually; which Duty every Pious man
conscientiously performs: For, it is not intended we should be always
exercised in vocal prayer, minding nothing else; in regard that is neither
necessary, nor required, nor possible. It will be sufficient and acceptable to
perform that duty daily as often as occasions are offered; (as these words in the
fourth Petition imply, Give us this day our daily bread) keeping our selves
always in a readiness to lift up our hands, voices and hearts in Prayer and
Thanksgivings to God, for our Selves, Relations and Friends, as we are engaged
by duty or promise; yea, and for our Enemies, as necessities require: For, this
is always implicitly done, whenever we offer up this Prayer, intentionally
including all that is thereby prayed for; and having our heart put into such a
Frame, that it is willing and striving, so far as it can extend, to take in all
things to be desired, on the behalf of God, of our selves or others; for, then,
it is as truly, (though not so sensibly) prayed for, as if particularly named;
and they who are kept in this posture, can never long forget to pray
explicitly, for them in words, whom they are obliged to remember, by promise,
by natural affection, or Christian Charity; especially, in immergent
Temptations, Calamities, times of extreme want and troubles, which being the
seasons wherein God has encouraged us to call upon him with a promise of
hearing and deliverance. Temptations are the most hazzardous of all the rest,
and those most perilsome whereinto we cast our selves. St. James says 1. 13.
Let no man say when he is tempted, that he it tempted of God; for, God cannot
be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man; but every one is tempted,
enticed, and drawn away by his own lusts. When lust has conceived, it brings
forth sin, and when sin is finished, it brings forth death: yet, by many
places in holy Scripture, and by the words of this Prayer, it seems employed,
that God tempts some; for, Christ would not have taught us to pray for
deliverance from the evil consequence, of that which never was or shall be
done. It is therefore true, that we are not tempted of God, as by the World,
the Flesh, and the Devil, to commit that which is absolutely sinful: or, to do
ought which may bring mischiefs or Inconveniences upon us without remedy, or
any future disadvantage, as by these Tempters. But, he sometimes exposes us
unto temptations, and otherwhile; does lead us into them, either for our
Probation, to give us experimental knowledge of our frailties, and of his
Mercies; or, to make our prudence and patience exemplary to others; and that we
may be honored, secured, or some other way advantaged thereby: as when Job was
exposed to the Devils malice for a Trial of his Patience; and when our Savior
was led by the spirit into the Wilderness to be tempted of the Devil. God,
likewise leaves always an Issue open out of those Temptations whereinto he
leads, and provideth, means whereby we may escape those evils, which then
are, or may be brought upon us; and is so far from intending ought to our
disadvantage thereby, that he preserves us from the evil of those temptations,
whereinto we wilfully run; and which the world and the malice of the Devil
design for out destruction: thus doing, not only, when we endeavor and pray
for it, but many times also, when we neither mind him or our own peril or
safeties.

2. Our First-parents when they were in their innocence, seem to have been led
into a twofold Temptation. It was a Temptation to have such a Tree planted in
the most perspicuous place of the Garden, that was desirable by Nature; and the
forbidding to taste a Fruit so desirable as that was, doubled the Temptation;
yea and somewhat more, if the humane Nature had been then as prone to do what
is forbidden, as it has been ever since: for as the Heathen Poet said,

Nitimur in vetitum semper, cupimusque, negata.
Things which we are forbid to do,
We still have a desire unto.
But GOD exposed them, thereunto, for Probation only, not to bring evil on
them; yea, that they might be confirmed in their Integrity by their obedience:
For, he had planted the Tree of Life in the same Garden, and had given them
will and power to forbear what he had forbidden, if (by giving more credit to
his enemy then to him) they had not been inclined to that selfness which made
the Temptation prevalent. And, though God fore-knew what they would do, it is
evident he intended them no evil but good, in regard he had eternally decreed a
Remedy whereby the Devils malice should be turned both to the advantage of
them, and of so many of their Posterity, as did not wilfully neglect, what he
enabled them to perfom. God, tempted Abraham to sacrifice his Son, (which
according to his own humane Laws, was an apparent sin) but, when he had made
trial of his obedience, to make his Faith exemplary to all his Posterity in the
flesh, (as also to them, who should be his spiritual seed in the same Faith;)
God, who knew before what he would do, sorbad the execution of his own command;
and rewarded Abraham with the greatest temporary Blessing, also, that ever was
conferred upon a mere mortal man; because, he saw him prosecute what he had
enjoined, even to the very stroke of death, out of pure obedience, love and
confidence in him, though the Actmight not only for ever deprive him of his
best beloved Son, but probably render him infamous also throughout all
Generations, for so unnatural and inhumane a murder, as that would have been
vulgarly reputed. When God leads, exposes, or (if it may be so called)
tempts any man, to the open professing, acting, or suffering of ought for his
glory, which may bring such great fears or terrible sufferings, as usually
tempt men to distrust his assistance, and causes them to Apostatize from their
duties and professions, he there leaves them not as the Devil and the World
does; but, always strengthens to the end, and delivers them from their fears
and torments (yea, makes their torments a pleasure and an honor to them) as
when the three Children were cast into the Fiery Furnace; or else he carries
them through it into Abraham's bosom, as he did Lazarus.

3. God is so far from tempting any to that, which may bring on them more evil
then good, that whosoever, by ignorance, delusion, or by both, shall without
unjust self ends or malice to others, prosecute an unjustifiable design to the
loss of his life, by the Laws of men; if he then did it conscienciously in Zeal
to Gods honor, believing unfaignedly it was approveable, and he thereto in
duty obliged (truly repenting his other misactings, and that so far forth
also, as he shall be convinced if was evil) I am persuaded, God will not charge
that upon him to his everlasting condemnation, though it be a sin in its own
Nature: For, God otherwhile permits some of his well-affected Servants, to
commit sins whereunto they are tempted by their own ignorance or failings; and
to suffer openly and ignominiously for them, that, their Brethren may be
thereby made the more heedful; and that his wilful Enemies may be thereby
hardened to their destruction: For, he often hardens the hearts of wilful
Offenders, to persevere in those transgression, whereunto the Devil, the World,
or their own Flesh has tempted them; because, they would not hear, know, and
execute Justice, when they might so have done, by his counsel, and proffered
assistance, This was exemplified in Pharaoh, Saul, Jeroboam, Jehu and others.
But, it cannot be properly called a tempting by God, or a leading them into
temptation, when he leaves or gives men opportunities after precautions? to do
those Evils, which they had a premeditated resolution and desire to execute of
their own accord, to fulfill their own Lusts; for they need no Temptations from
without themselves: God, tempts none, but for their probation only, to their
advantage; and then, accompanies it with Gracious means to preserve them both
from all wicked Actions, and those evil consequences which may ensue.

4. This is employed, by reading these words, Lead us not, in this sense, as
some do, (which the Original will bear) thus; Let us not be so led into
temptation, but that we may be delivered from the evil consequences thereof. I
can pray absolutely for this mercy, and for all such, as are absolutely
promised, and warranted to those who ask them in Fait: But, I dare not to pray
absolutely for obtaining, or for Deliverance from any outward thing, which I
naturally most desire or fear (no not from all temptations, prosperities or
adversities, joy or sorrow, life or death,) save with reference to Gods will;
for, of all these, (the last excepted) I have had experience, whereby I find
that, through Gods Mercy, the worst (according to our opinion of them) have
been as profitable unto me as the best. I, therefore leave the giving, or
taking them away, to Gods good pleasure; and all I absolutely pray for, is,
that they may be directed, employed, suffered or enjoyed to his glory, and my
eternal Salvation; and to this end we ought always to pray for deliverance from
those Temptations which we are led into as well by our ordinary callings as
otherwise; and to be watchful also, left by degrees, we are insensibly
surprised, by adventuring a little and a little further, until by presumption,
we are lost irrecoverably before we are aware. I cannot deny, but that it was a
good prayer of Agur the son of Jaketh which he prayed, Prove. 30. Give me
neither poverty nor riches, and feed we with food convenient for we, left I be
full and deny the Lord, or be poor and steal, to the blaspheming of his Name;
yet, I cannot absolutely pray for any more then my Daily bread, but leave the
rest to Gods Will, because, I know that by his Grace, we may glorify him, both
in poverty and wealth, in prosperity and adversity; and that there are as well
advantages as disadvantages in either. I am resolved, God shall choose for me,
as he has hitherto done; and that, though he should not provide for me
hereafter as heretofore, or if I shall increase both my wants, and my Enemies
by prosecutting what I think to be my Duty, I will nevertheless, put it unto
adventure; for, though the world more and more forsakes me, and my Friends are
grown less able and fewer then they were; and fewer yet may be, (considering in
what posture we are) I will whilst God gives: me time and opportunity, express
all that I think necessary to be said to this Generation, pertinent to the
glory of God, or the welfare of his people, when I find it seasonable,
whomsoever I may thereby displease, if he preserve me, as faithful as I desire
to be, and as I believe he will.

5. In the mean time I will prosecute what I know to be seasonable; and since
there are Temptations which may have evil Consequences in the necessary actions
and affairs of this life, into which God leads us both for his glory, and for
our good, and in those also which he permits for our probation (unless we pray
and endeavor for his assisting Grace) I desire it may be better considered,
how dangerous those Temptations are, which we wilfully run into of our selves,
contrary to Gods revealed Will, after many precautions, counsels, exhortations,
and judgments both threatened and inflicted. What will become of them who are
nothing bettered, but still worse and worse, after a frequent intermixture of
Judgments and Mercies, playing with them, like Fies about Candles, till their
Wings are burnt; and continue, even then, buzzing about them? or like Children
sporting, at the mouth of a Wasps or Hornets-neast, with these temptations,
which will sting them to death? Some, who began with frugality, and being well
contented with an honest competent gain, had sufficient for their increasing
charge; being tempted by opportunities whereby they might grow rich by unlawful
and dishonest dealings; and yiedling to the temptations, either Covetousuess
(being infatiable) inclines them to all oppressions whereby it may be fed; or
else, Voluptuousness allures them by one longing to another, and by living at
the height of their Incomes to satisfy every days lust, according to the
custom of Prodigals, until their longings being endless, and Trading or
Revenues failing by losses or other contingencies, they bring themselves and
their Children either to debauchery or beggary; or to seek supply by wicked
courses. Others are surprised by temptations of several kinds, whereinto they
plunge themselves. First, they go to Brothel houses with their Companions to
see fashions; then, with others, to improve their experience; and then alone,
to try their single strength, till they are overcome by the temptation,
ensnared and destroyed by loathsome diseases in their bodies, or, by that which
is more mischievous to their Souls. Some do game at at first, but for
recreation, or to pass away the time, until they are so delighted with it, that
they neglect meat, sleep, business, friends, and all other things, as if there
were no other time well spent: That, brings on a covetous desire to cheat other
men of their Estates by false play; and that Vice continues, until meeting with
more cunning Cheaters, then they themselves are, all their own is quite lost,
and no means of subsistence left, except to turn Parasite, Pander, Marry a rich
Whore, or steal and be hanged, if they have no Friend at Court. The Drunkard at
first perhaps goes to the Tavern or Alehouse, but to drink his mornings
draught; a while after goes early in the morning, and continues drinking till
midnight, or till the next day at noon. Or, at first to entertain Friends, with
whom he casually meets; then for neighbourhood-sake; then under pretense of the
more convenience to dispatch businesses; then oftener to, play the good fellow
as he calls it; and then every day to be drunk. When Dinah went upon a needless
idle visit out of curiosity, to see and complement with the daughters of the
Land where her Father sojourned, she was ravished before she returned, and
horrible murders and hypocrisy ensued also thereupon. So, perchance it fares
otherwhile with our Ladies and Gentlewomen, whose frequent visits, proceed not
so much from civil or friendly respects, as to see, and be seen, or to a worse
intent: For though there be seeming passages of kind endearments among them,
while they are together; as soon as they are parted, they ofttimes bitterly
censute, scoff and jeer at each other; or prosecute such Feminine designs, as
occasion many future temptations and evil consequences, which might be
prevented by a modest and temperate use of their Civil and Christian Liberty in
things indifferent; and by harkening with heed to wholesome cautions and
counsels given; yea, though by despised persons; for it seems Job thought
himself obliged not to contemn it in his Servants; nor King Pharaoh to neglect
it in Joseph, though a poor Prisoner and a Slave. When this Joseph went into
the house wherein his Mistress was, to prosecute his Masters Affairs and his
own; God, then led him into a temptation, and preserved him from the evil
consequences, which would else probably have ensued; whereas, had he gone
thither to spend the time with her in vain complements, it is likely the
temptation would have prevailed according to her desire. But, there are some
who presume further then any of those aforementioned, For, when they have so
weakened their bodies, by long complying with every temptation, that their flesh
is not able to tempt them, as it has done; and the Devil, perhaps also, thinks
himself so sure of them, that he holds them not worth tempting; these do then
create temptations and unnatural provocations to lusts, by luxurious meats,
costly drinks, and unclean representations, till they become thereby miserable
in body and soul; loathsome to God and man; and make their own flesh (which is
a Dalilah prone enough of her self) to betray them to all destructive
temptations; and she (without whom, neither the World, nor the Devil has power
to work upon them) is made to be more prevalent by evil Custom, then she was by
corrupted nature, to bring upon them irrecoverable mischiefs. All premises
considered, the last Clause of this Petition, is daily, yea always (as much as
possible) to be minded, and offered up with Faith in sincerity; especially for
deliverance from the Evil of Sin, by whose removal all other evils are
superseded.

6. There are other temptations wherewith our Grand Enemy, with his two
Confederates the Flesh and the World, endeavors to ensnare us; and are such
as may be numbered among spiritual wickednesses. These get entrance into those
out of whom gross sins are expelled. The Root of these wickednesses is double,
PRIDE and DESIRE, which corrupted the Devil and our First-parents in Heavenly
places. It is written, Hebrews 6. 4. to this effect; If men are once
enlightened, have tested of the heavenly gift, were made partakers of the holy
Ghost, relished the word of God, and the power of the world to come, and then
fall away; It is impossible for them to be renewed by repentance: For they have
crucified unto themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to open shame. The
Roprobation of no small number in the Visible Church, springs from hence; even
of some, who have been eminent for their knowledge in Divine Mysteries, and in
those gifts which tend to the instruction and sanctification of others. These
are they who may be termed Stars fallen from Heaven, or Angels, who having
forsaken their first Love, become Vassals to Antichrist in his Kingdom upon
Earth, or Slaves to the Flesh. Many Saints have been in hazard of this
Apostasy, by neglect of the preceding Caution, through carnal security; yet
nave happily recovered (before a total falling off) by their timely penitence,
(God casting such a look upon them, as Christ did on Peter) and by their Faith
endeavoring and praying unto him acccording to the Contents of this Prayer.
Many are now in danger also, of having that Earth, which by good husbanding may
bring forth acceptable Fruit to all, so cursed, that it shall bring forth
nothing but Thistles, Thorns and Briers; which curse they might have avoided by
heedfusness heretofore; and be yet delivered from it, by performing what is
possible as aforesaid, and by taking more heed hereafter how they fall into
such perilous Temptations.

7. But, very many are in other modes destructively ensnared into spiritual
wickednesses by unheeded temptations; and in what I next treat of, I shall
insist upon what will concern some, whose condition will be very considerable
at this time, therefore; observe it. When they were in their polluting blood,
without ability to help themselves, and without other helpers; God, casting a
pitiful eye upon them, and speaking unto them by his Word, interpreted and made
effectual by the cooperation of the holy Ghost, they became so far enlightened
as to see how vile they were by Nature, and to what misery that would have
brought them, both in this life and in that to come, if GOD, who loved us
first, even when we were his Enemies, had not of his own accord provided a
Remedy. This, so wrought upon them, that (partly out of love to themselves, and
partly, in thankfulness for that mercy) they gave him a portion of their Love,
unto whom all was due, and who never leaves them totally to themselves, who
have once given up unto him their whole heart. Notwithstanding this Reserve
(somewhat resembling that of Ananias and Saphira) God, not seeming to heed it,
as he did their hypocrisy; these felt such a sweetness in those beginnings of
a gracious influence, that they not only endeavored to increase the Knowledge
of God and of his Truth; but, so also, to mortify the lusts of their Flesh,
that they attained to an extraordinary outward holiness, beyond many other
professors of Christianity; yea, to hazard also their Liberties and Estates in
suffering for their consciences, and for reproving Injustice and Impiety. This,
got them so much love, among all those good men to whom they were known, that
they heaped on them many benefits and kindnesses, to the recompencing of their
sufferings; with a surplusage to the augmenting also of their former poor
Estates and Reputations, until by degrees they grew rich in superfluities; and
from being contemptible, to be of general esteem; which revived in them a gust
of carnal delights and accommodations, that, they began to be weary of those
prosecutions, whereunto they were engaged, by what they had begun to profess
and practice in relation to the honor and service of God: And, though this
secret Apostasy they discovered not openly, the Devil discerning it by many
Symptoms, he and his Confederate the World (knowing how useful such persons may
be to their ends, and to the upholding of their Kingdom) tempted them at the
first, with an addition to their livelihood in certain, whereby they might be
freed from depending upon uncertain contributions, at the will and pleasure of
their Benefactors: after that, they doubled their favors upon them, as they
perceived them to operate for their purpose; and, finding them so to fall away
more and more, from their Integrity, by those temptations, that they were,
likely to be serviceable, to whatsoever they should employ them; the world then
conferred upon them, the highest Dignities, which she had power to bestow, and
whereof their qualifications made them seem capable. Then, these became their
servants in body and soul, so perfectly corrupted, that both the light of
Reason and Grace, which formerly shined in them, were extinguished; GOD was
quite forgot, with what concerned their own eternal happiness; and they
bewitched with the Pleasures and Preferments of this life, repolluted
themselves with all gross sins, as at the beginning, Notwithstanding all this
back-stiding, so superaboundant is GODS long-suffering and patience, that to
reclaim some of these, before they arrived at the hight of their wickedness and
Apostasy, he graciously intermingled Judgments and Mercies; first humbling
them again, by such oppressions and persecutions, as they had inflicted upon
others; pouring such contempt upon them, that it forced them to wander where
was no way, or abiding place, and raising storms which caused them to stagger
to and fro like drunken men, from one resolution to another; and brought them
to some consideration, what they were likely to stumble into; and into a fear,
left the gods whom they last trusted in, had either for saken them, or were not
able to help them; This, a while, reduced them again to a little formal
Humiliation: but, before they had improved it into a true Repentance, the World
prevented it, by supplying what might keep them constant to her Interest; and,
GOD permitting her to prevail (for purposes by these unheeded) they recovered
again their lost temporary hopes, Estates and Dignities, with an advantage; and
that makes them so confident, our God Almighty so favors them, and is so well
pleased in all their compliances with Antichrist in his Mystery of Iniquity,
that they more maliciously, and more furiously persecute them, who protest
against it, then heretofore; and are fallen off a degree further form Grace and
Penitence. This is the condition of many, yet, even they who have prevaricated
in this mode, and slipped so deep, and so far down into the Whirl-pool of
Reprobation, may be capable of recovery by Gods Mercy, if whilst life
continues, the, can look up again toward him, by Faith, when the Holy Ghost
shall vouchsafe them another Call, as sometimes he does at the brink of Hell;
yea, delivers some of those from the evil of these Temptations, if they can
heartily join with the Catholic Church, in this Prayer; to which end (and to
no worse) I have offered this to their consideration, whom it may concern.

9. Some other in a differing manner from these, (and are as dangerously
tempted unto wickedness) having a beginning and progress in the Spirit, end at
last in the Flesh also, through defect of due watchfulness, and by being
unmindful of praying for deliverance from such Temptations. These, are such as
being puffed up with a superficial Knowledge of some Divine Mysteries; (by
External Mortifications by strict observance of the Moral Law; by supposed
Revelations, by frequent Hearing, Praying, and outward performances of Holy and
Pious Duties, by their gifts of Preaching, Prophesying, or doing Miracles; or
by a constancy in long and extreme sufferings, or with suchlike) are so filled
with a Spiritual Pride, and overweening of their own Sanctity and personal
Meritoriousness, that they separate themselves from all other Christian
Societies, with such an affected singularity, as may seem to call out like
Jehu, Come see our Zeal: For these presuming themselves only (and those who are
conformable to their Judgments and Practices) to be the Elect of GOD, judge
all other men to be in a Reprobated condition; their Morality, and Piety to be
but Fruits of the Flesh; their Illuminations, to be but Ignes fatuis, Phanatick
Fires, and false lights, how true soever: And (forgetting to do to others, as
they heretofore desired other men should do to them) persecute both with hand
and tongue, as far as their power will extend, all those who are not in every
punctilio of their Judgment. And, not a few of these, either fall at last into
gross fleshly sins, which do shamefully bedurt them, before they are humbled
into an exemplary Repentance; or, else are hardened into a final Obduracy. The
pretended Piety of such as these, and the evident Profaneness of others, have
like two Mil-stones, so ground those between them, who sincerely profess and
practice Honesty and Piety according to their Conscience and Understanding,
that it has almost rooted Peace out of the world, and begotten, so
inextricable a confusion, that all reasonable men stand at gaze to observe what
it will amount unto at the last; For, since I first knew the world, most things
are so metamorphosed from what they then were, in my judgment, that I see
little essential difference between the greatest numbers, of those who are
Phanaticks reputed, and those who so repute them; yea, there is such a change
in their Countenances, in their Years, in their Education, in their Habits, and
in their Deportments, both among subordinate Magistrates, and those under their
Authority; In Governors of Counties, Cities and Buroughs, and those who are
to be governed; and in Reformers, with such as should be Reformed, as if the
Head and Tail had changed places, and would hazard the reducing all into an
Anarchy ere long.

10. I have observed other mixed Temptations (partly spiritual, and partly
carnal) which it will concern us both to strive and pray against, lest they
draw us into fleshly pollutions before we are aware. One is, that strong
natural affection which is frequently begotten between men and women, by a true
esteem of the Piety and Moral Virtues which they mutually apprehend in each
other, and which had beginning at first without any respect to their bodily
Beauties and perfections: For, by long conversing together, finding themselves
to be reciprocally much edified and comforted by those qualifications, it so
inflames the natural affection of the best disposed persons toward each other;
so inclines them to pity their sufferings (if they have any) and sometime so
indears their persons, that otherwhile, their souls draw their bodies to a
nearer conjunction (though it be but with a touch of the hand only) then
consists with the preservation of a pure chastity, and by inflaming the blood
before they are aware of it, brings them by degrees into dalliances,
indangering the coldest temper, through overmuch confidence in their own
strength, till modesty perhaps is quite lost. This has often happened, and
brought some, who seemed far from it, to a scandalous impudency at last, and
past shame and repentance in all other Vices: From this hazard, no man can be
secured but by earnest praying for Gods assisting Grace, and by continual
watching and endeavoring to be preserved from such temptations: For even in
persons virtuously and piously affected, there will often revive an inclination
to meet in private, to give and take such aids and consolations, as they will
think needful; yea, at such times, and in such places also, that unless God in
Mercy prevents it, such distempers as aforesaid, will not possibly be totally
avoided, cured or abated; nor their innocence escape blasting, though their
conversations have been every way blameless in all other respects: For, some
have had personal Experience of such defamations, betwixt whom there never
passed a wanton word, or so much as a familiar touch of each others hand; and
had also many sufferings both in flesh and spirit by such endearments, though
they were providentially led into them, without their own seeking, which by
Gods Mercy, produced comfortable effects in the conclusion, as all those
temptations do, whereinto God leads us for our probation; and among them all,
there is none more difficultly resisted, in regard the most enticing
allurements, of beautiful wantons, are not half so dangerously provocative, as
when the Devil takes advantage to unite his endeavors with the frailty of the
flesh, to work upon virtuous and pious Persons; nor is the defaming or
polluting of any other so satisfactory to his malice. There is another
temptation, whereby many are ensnared, (and often as much, through wilfulness
as heedlesness) to the occasioning both of carnal and spiritual wickedneses;
and thereof St. Paul counsels us to be wary, in these words, 2 Cor. 6. 14. Be
not unequally yoaked. For, when Believers join themselves in Marriage with
Infidels, or with such as are nursed up in Idolatry and Superstition, it
exposes them to many perilous temptations, no less destructive to Christians
now, then it was to the Israelites heretofore; and the greatest and wisest
persons, are not more able to resist them then Solomon was: When the Sons of
GOD took of the Daughters of men to be their wives, Genesis 6. 2. they begot a
monstrous generation; and the like intermixture in blood and repugnant
Principles, has made such Medlies and Mungrel broods of Profesors in the
world, to the increasing of Atheism, Heresies and Profaneness, that true Piety
and humanity will be in hazard of being rooted up, unless we heartily pray and
endeavor to be delivered from the evil of this Temptation.

11. It is considerable also, whether we cast not our selves into many
temptations whereinto God leads us not, through overweening at least; and
thereby, into sufferings, which God requi^es not at our hands: For, though God
leads us into some temptations, either to be exemplary, or to prove us both
for his honor and our own; as when our Savior was led into the wilderness to
be tempted of the Devil, with suchlike; (to which probations he always gives
an isue for their advantage who are so led) yet, he sometimes permits even his
Elect, to weary out themselves in such Attempts as they adventure upon, by
their own single light, that, both they and others may have experimental
proofs, how unsafe it is to depend upon ought unwarranted by his Word and
Spirit: Many have been deprived of their hopes, and incurred also, temporary
hazzards and mischiefs through defect of this heed. I think it hot fitting more
should be imposed upon men, by men, then they are capable of; or, that we
should judge between GOD and men in matters which he has reserved to his own
Judgment. Therefore, without judging, or imposing my Judgment upon any, I do
but only offer mine (as I have often said) to be entertained or rejected, as
it shall deserve; and to precaution those who are overperemptory in adhering to
the Literal sense of single Texts of holy Scripture, to examine well whether it
be consonant to the Fundamental Doctrines intended by the general scope of Gods
Word. For, either the Letter is vitiated, or the interpretation in one of those
places, where contradiction is evident. As for Example: St. James Chapt. 2. 9.
says, If ye have respect to persons ye commit sin, and are convinced of the
Law as transgressors. From this single Text, some have taken occasion to deny
Civil respects, not only from one private person to another, but to those in
Authority also; and pious and honest men are deluded with this error. Denying
respect to persons, appears to be reproveable by St. Paul; for, Romans 13. he not
only injoyns Subjection (which is the greatest personal respect) to our
Superiors, and to all in Authority; but likewise, a personal respect to all in
general, according to their Civil Rights. Give, faith he, Tribute to whom
Tribute, Custom to whom Custom, fear to whom fear, Honor to whom Honor, and
Love to whom love belongs. And the neglect of these Duties has occasioned
evil consequents: For, this Precept is according to the Will of GOD; and Sr.
James intended nothing thereunto repugnant, in the words aforementioned, if
rightly understood;as appears, by their contexture, with what precedes: for he
speaks not against civil respects, but (as the plain words demonstrate)
against respect of persons, in relation to the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and in having less regard unto the poor, then unto the rich, in dispencing the
benefits communicable indifferently to all: as also against those who are more
inclined to distribute Justice with partiality to them who are in power, then
righteously, unto them who are weak and poor; and in thus misunderstanding
other Scriptures (to the heed whereof, this Hint may perhaps lead some) many
fall into dangerous temptations, which might be avoided, by not trusting
overmuch to their single Talent; and by adding Divine Light thereunto, with
diligent endeavor, and hearty prayer, to be delivered from the Evil of
Temptations.

Lastly, let us take heed that we are not more transported by a natural
stoutness and wilfulness of heart, of by a proud scorn of our malicious
Adversaries, even in our most innocent sufferings, then carried on and
supported by a true poverty of spirit and Christian meekness, for righteousness
sake. For, unless we be sanctified with an humble submission to Gods
probations, our own strength and innocence will not preserve us constant to the
end, though it may carry us far. This Caution, few men may better give then I;
for, I have had experience of this temptation, and that God will prove us,
until we are quite beaten out of all our vain hopes and fleshly confidences, if
there were ever any truth and sincerity in our hearts.

12. Evil, is the last word in this Petition; and for deliverance from it, is
that whereto, all the three last Petitions tend; for the abuse even of the
means of our natural subsistence, and of the forgiveness of our Debts and
Trespasses, will oftentimes have need of that deliverance. This EVIL is
twofold; the Evil of Sin, and the Evil of Punishment. Of the first* the Devil
and we our selves only, are both Authors, and Actors: And the Evil of
Punishment proceds only from Gods Justice, to give the wicked their reward;
and from his Mercy, to correct and bring those who are corrigible, to that
contrition which will produce Repentance, rendering them capable also, of Love
and Glory. Is there any evil in the City, (says a Prophet, personating God
speaking it) which I have not done? Meaning the Evil of Punishment. This Evil,
GOD is pleased sometimes to inflict immediately with his own hand; sometimes,
the Devil is his Executioner; sometimes, wicked men; sometimes, he makes the
Saints instrumental therein, by rubbing them against each other, (to the
grievance both of their Flesh and Spirit) till like Diamonds they polish each
other; and sometimes* he makes men to be Executioners of his Judgments upon
themselves. This being part of my Meditations upon the Body of this Prayer, I
now come to the Conclusion.

The Epilogue.
For, thine is the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory for ever.
1. THis Epilogue, or Conclusion of the preceding Prayer, is a Doxology,
implying that Praise, or Thanksgiving ought to be inseparable from Prayer; the
acknowledging of one Mercy, being the readiest way to obtain another. It is
annexed to the Prayer by this causal FOR, which gives us a sufficient Reason to
encourage our praying unto our Father with Faith unwavering, in regard he is
not only our Father; but a King also, and not without a Kingdom, as many have
been, merely titulary; or a King of a Kingdom, not able to secure it self from
foreign Invasions, or Domestic Rebellions, but of The Kingdom, which extends
throughout Heaven and Earth, yea, into Hell; and whereto all other Kings,
Kingdoms and States, are Vassals and tributaries, expellable at his pleasure. A
Kingdom it is, both Powerful and Glorious; The Kingdom and King thereof are
Eternal: It has no pretenders laying claim thereto, occasioning such quarrels
as happen in Elective Kingdoms, or such mischiefs as are frequent, where it
being Hereditary, the next Heir, is a Fool or a Tyrant, or both (neither
regardful of his Duty to God or man) yet, must be preferred before his
Brethren, and before all the wisest and uprightest men in the Land, though it
will be to the destruction of himself and his people. All the Laws of this
Kingdom; All the Prerogatives, this King claims, are so Universally
righteous, that, not one of his Subjects murmures at them; Therein, are no
Customs, Prescriptions or Presidents pleadable to infringe their Freedoms, or
occasioning the renewing of Charters: For, this Kings Justice, Favor and Love
are so generally, perpetually, and impartially extended, without exception,
that they are all Comites Palatini, Count Palatines of his Royal Palace,
admitted unto a Kingship with his best beloved Son, in the same Kingdom; and
invested with his Power and Glory. Oh! the inexpressible Love and Mercy of GOD,
to Mankind! On which of the Angels has he conferred this Dignity? what
despicable things are the greatest Kings of the earth, in respect of his
meanest subject! Who that considers this, would dread their Frowns, or dote
upon their Favors, so much, as to obey their commands in opposition to his
whatsoever sufferings exposed unto, by their fury in this short life? or, who
that is not grown more brutish then a Beast, can be doubtful or jealous, that
be who provided such unspeakable preferments for his Elect at so dear a rate,
as the lifeblood of his best beloved Son, will leave them destitute of any
thing they pray for in his Name, that is necessary to carry them through this
World, in prosecution of those services which he sent them hither to perform;
if they remember he has promised all necessaries for them, who first seek the
Kingdom of Heaven, and the righteouss thereof? And who can be so stupid, into
whom this Kingdom is entered in any measure, as not to pray heartily it may come
quickly?

2. I had here concluded my Meditations at this present, both concerning this
Kingdom and this Prayer; but I perceive that as well some Subjects of this
Kingdom, as the Sovereigns and Subjects of Kingdoms upon earth, do much mistake
their Privileges, and by their Intrenchments on both sides, as also, by their
mutual jealousness (sometimes without just cause) acting against each other to
the destroying of their own peace. I have said a little for prevention thereof
in my Meditation upon the second Petition, but it will be necessary to iterate
somewhat to that purpose. For, the Supreme Magistrate supposing all things
whatsoever, to be disposable at his will and pleasure, whether it concerns God,
or the People, (in their Estates or Considences) are jealous none can be truly
Faithful to their Persons or Governments, who choose rather to suffer then obey
their Commands, though such believe these Commands are repugnant to Gods; and
though they intend nothing destructive to humane Authorities, in ought
unquestionably pertinent thereto; nor seek to avenge themselves for any real or
supposed wrong sustained, but, leave that to God. Their Subjects in like
manner, yea some of them, belonging to Christ's Kingdom (mistaking the true
nature thereof) suppose their Freedoms even in spiritual concernments, are to
be vindicated and established by the temporal Sword in their own hands, give
occasion otherwhile also, of the aforesaid Jealousies, and of bringing evil
consequences thereby on themselves and others. It is true, that the temporal
Sword belongs to the civil Magistrate, whether Monarchical, Aristocratical or
Democratical, for defense of their Countries and Civil Interests and to execute
Justice upon Malefactors, for preserving Righteousness and Peace within their
proper Jurisdictions, and between them and their Neighbors: It is permitted
also to private men, for defense of their just Rights and Possessions from
unlawful violence; but not approveable to avenge their personal wrongs at their
own pleasure; because, it will occasion evil consequences, both in Divine and
Civil respects. Nor is the Sword intended to be in the Supreme Magistrates hand
to despoil other men of their just Rights, or to get a vain honor by
Conquests; or to exercise it upon the persons of men, to enforce their
Consciences contrary to their belief in matters relating to God, and the
Salvation of the Soul: For, that is mere Turcism and Antichristian Tyranny,
seldom practiced by the worst of Heathens, until the Mystery of Iniquity began
to work; in regard, the propagation and settling of Truth, in the Profession and
practice of Religion, must be endeavored by the Spiritual Sword, and those
Instruments which are not carnal. Therefore, they who profess Christ,
(whatsoever Piety or Zeal they pretend to his honor and Kingdom) and yet seek
to force other men to believe and practice as they do, by persecuting them in
Body or Estate, are therein confederates with Antichrist; and do not that to
other men, which they would that other men should do unto them. It will concern
them very seriously to consider this, who are lately made sensible of that in
their own persons, whereof they were insensible in the persons of their,
Brethren; For, uncharitable censurings, revilings, or an Offensive Sword,
appertains not to the Saints in any private avengement, though at sometimes a
Defensive Sword may be more needful then their Garments, as appears by the
words of Christ, Luke 22. 36. and then it may be used for their safeguard; not
to avenge themselves, no, not to avenge the blood of their Brethren in such
manner as many conceive it may: For, it is said, Revel. 16. 5, 6. that it is He
who IS, and WAS and SHALL BE, that Judges them, who shed the blood of the
Saints, and who shall give them blood to drinks, as they have deserved. And,
they whom he shall employ to make use of that Sword, to do execution upon the
BEAST, and the Mother of Harlots, (so far forth as it will be requisite) shall
be her own Vassals and Confederates. St. John also says. Revel. 17. the ten
Horns or Kings, which received power with the BEAST, and being of one mind
with him, in joining their powers against the Lamb, shall hate the Whore, make
her desolate, naked, eat her flesh, and burn her with Fire. God, will put it
into their hearts to execute his will upon her, though, until his time comes
they shall outwardly submit unto the Beast; and both they, and the Whore which
rides her, dissemble with each other, till the day of her utter desolation; and
then, as it is prophesied, Revel. 15. 3. the Song of the Saints shall be to
this effect.

Great, and wondrous are thy Deeds,
LORD the, Saints Almighty King:
Righteousness from thee proceeds,
True thou art in every thing.
Feared, and glorified, O Lord!
Thou shall be of every one;
And, of Nations all adored;
For, thou holy art, alone:
And, thy Judgments every where,
Fully manifested are.
3. This I conceive to be the meaning of that Prophecy, and that the power of
Christ's Word, which is called a Sword proceeding out of his month, better
beseems the Dignity of the Saints, then that which is committed to the Hangman,
and to every Ruffian-like-Souldier; though the use of that Sword is honorable,
when employed as it ought to be. The Saints (who are often subject to the
ignorances and infirmities common to men) should well consider (as I believe
they will) what disadvantage it has been, and may be unto themselves and their
Brethren, to pretend unto the Civil sword, until God puts it unquestionably
into their hands; and mean while betake themselves to that only, which is
proper to their Warfare; not supposing all the Actions of the Saints recorded
in the Old Testament, are to be exemplary Rules to us, in every thing, wherein
they did well: For, though to Josuah, David and others the temporal sword was
proper to the work they had to do, and to conquer that temporal Inheritance,
which God had given to his people, and to avenge him upon his and their
Enemies; and is so now in their hands, to whom it is given to the like
purposes: yea, though under the Law, to take an eye for an eye, a tooth for a
tooth, and to give rewards to their Enemies according to their Cruelty; yet, by
the Doctrine of Christ's Gospel; it is not so lawful in our personal and private
quarrels; for we are thereby taught to do good for evil; To seek their welfare
who persecute us, and not so much as to pray against their persons, but only;
against their wickedness; much less then are we to plot, or combine against the
Civil Power, whereunto God has subjected us, notwithstanding we are oppressed
thereby, but must wait patiently for deliverance by him in his own way, and in
his own time. This is my private Judgment; which, having, not without Cause
declared, I leave those who are contrarily minded, unto their own opinions,
until Gods Judgments or Mercies have wrought it out of them: For, though some
perhaps may think it would strengthen the hands of Persecutors and Oppressors,
if this were generally professed and practiced; I know this is agreeable to the
patience of the Saints; and that they who kill with the Sword, in avengement of
their own Cause, to the scandalizing of their Christian Profession, (and to the
exposing others to a destructive suspicion) shall at last perish by the sword,
or, by somewhat equivalent thereto, either in their own hands, or in the hands
of those Avengers, whom God will animate or permit to execute Justice, both
against private and public Usurpers of the temporal sword, how politic,
powerful, holy or secure soever they think themselves to be, Revel. 13. 10.
Therefore, as it is written in the last words of that Chapter, If any man has
an ear to hear, let him hear.

4. For Ever, This word EVER, is of a larger extent, in this place, then it
usually has; and signifies as much as Eternally. For, the Person to whom this
Kingdom, Power and Glory appertains, being External so are also his Kingdom,
Power and Glory; whereas, when other Kingdoms, or any thing else, is said to be
For Ever, we are not to understand them to be Everlasting without end; but to
continue so long only, as the persons or their Posterity, on whom they are
conferred, shall continue in being, and in performing the Conditions whereupon
they are granted; or, during the Term limited and preordained by the Granter,
to the things granted; and this King, Kingdom, Power and Glory, being as
aforesaid, without Beginning, Limitation, or Condition premised, are
Coeternal. The meaning of this word Ever, is here to be thus largely taken;
and the true Nature of it, is rightly understood and made use of in that sense,
by the Professors of our Common Law here in England, as the meaning of our Law:
For when Lands or Tenements are given and granted by Deed to any man For Ever,
he has an Estate therein, but during the term of his life only; that being
his personal Ever: but, when it is given and granted unto him and his Heirs for
ever, they have all a perpetual Interest of Right thereunto, whilst the world
lasts, and any Heir of his therein surviveth.

With respect to the particulars expressed in these Meditation, I do offer up
this Prayer to God implicitly by intention, (though not explicitly in words)
at all times; and having often spoken it in the Original, and in the words of
our English Translations in Prose, I will now speak it Paraphrased in the
Metrical words and Language of my English Muse.

Our Father, who in Heaven does reside;
Thy Name, for evermore, be sanctified.
Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will on earth be done
Even as it is in Heaven, by every one.
This present day, with daily bread relieve us;
As others we forgive, our sins forgive us.
And when thou leadest us into temptation,
Form Evil, then, vouchsafe us preservation.
For, thine, the Kingdom, Power and Glory be
For ever; and belong to none but thee.
A Hymn of Praise to GGD for his abatement of the late raging Pestilence,
containing some Cautionary acknowledgements of our undeserving so great a Mercy.
It may be sung to the Tune of the 148 Psalm, repeating the last strain of that
Tune.
COme, my sad Brethren, come,
And, both with heart and voice,
In God, now let us, whom
He has redeemed, rejoice.
They, who have been
In those Depths, where, great wonders were,
His power have seen:
And so have we;
For, us he has preserved from death
This day to see.
2.
That Angel of the LORD,
Which David hovering saw
With his unsheathed sword,
Thereby to put in aw
Jerusalem,
Even he, has here, put us in fear,
Who frighted them:
And, in this place
Has slaughtered more, then heretofore,
In so short space.
3.
Before us and behind,
And, likewise on each side,
We empty dwellings find
Where thousands lived and died.
In every street,
Both night and day, in sad array,
The Mourners meet.
He, that did rise
At Morning well, ere Noon, his Knell,
Tells us he dies.
4.
With one stroke some he slew,
Some; thrice were sick and well;
And some he did pursue,
Who, by the fourth stroke fell.
Thus, in pure Love,
Mercies, and threats, God often repeats,
Our hearts to prove:
Gives, and withdraws,
And, then proceeds, as, what succeeds
Does give him cause.
5.
This Angel spared neither
Good, Bad, nor young nor old;
But crammed them all together,
Within one earthen Mold.
But, blessed are they
Who, then to rest, in peace with Christ,
Were took away,
Secured from
All Evils here, that present were,
And those to come.
6.
Blessed be his Name, who thus
Of them disposed has;
And, till this day, to us
Vouchsafes Reprieves from death.
Oh! sing his praise:
And, thus to do, Lord mind us too,
Throughout our days;
That, we may more
Henceforth, fulfill, thy sacred Will,
Then heretofore.
7.
Our Vows are now at pawn;
And though we merit naught,
That hand, thou have withdrawn
Which here such slaughters wrought:
The Storm's allayd:
But, still some Drops, in our best hopes,
Make us afraid;
And, lo, the Course
Which we are in, augmenting sin,
Makes that fear worse.
8.
Thy Judgments we apply
To that which we design;
Even when on us they lie,
As if they were not thine.
Thine Arm we hide:
To cloud thy deeds, in their proceeds,
Truth is belied.
So far are they
From penitence, whom impudence
Does lead astray.
9.
How few! O GOD, how few!
Thy Love and Patience heed!
How does sin still renew!
How does it still exceed!
Nor we who saw
What thou have done, think thereupon,
With prudent aw:
And, fear we may,
That, few will come much bettered home,
Who fled away.
10.
Oh! turn us Lord, to thee,
Before we stray so far,
That turned we cannot be,
Till quite consumed we are.
Thy Messenger,
Does waiting stand at thy command,
Still lingering here:
And, unless we
Our lives repent, will back be sent,
And fiercer be.
11.
God, other Judgments has
(And, they draw near us too)
To execute his wrath,
Where this Plague shall not go:
And, if they come
Ere Course we take our peace to make,
Black is our Doom,
For, they will spoil
All that is left yet unbereft,
Throughout this Isle.
12.
Yea, but that some we have
(As, I hope, still we shall)
For whose sake God will save
From what may else befall,
He then will strike
Our sinful Land, with his own Hand
Gomorrah like.
But, in him trust,
And, you shall find he is as kind
As he is Just.
The Warning-piece to London, printed by an imperfect Copy, these five
following Stanza's, being found in the hands of several Friends, who had them
in Manuscript, above three years now past, it was desired they might be here
inserted, that, they who so pleased might add them to their Printed Book.

This comes in, between the 1 and 2 Stanza.
2. THy seeming Pious Holy Days,
In which the Vulgar much delights,
Are kept as little to Gods praise,
As heathenish Baccanalian Rites.
The Feast-days which thou do pretend
In honor of our Saviors Birth,
Thou do in lawless gaming spend,
In drunken, Riot and vain mirth;
Whereas, if then, thou fedst the poor,
Thy Feasting, him would honor more.
This between the 7. and 8. Stranza
8. I thence collect, that, though in thee
A secret Burning does appear,
Consumed, at once, thou shall not be
As Sodom and Gomorrah were.
From house, to house in various wise
Gods Judgment rather will proceed,
And those by some and some surprise
Who of his Mercies, take no heed:
That, he may quite consume the dross,
And, purge the Silver without loss.
This between the 13 and 14.
16. Know that thy Walls, thy lofty Towers,
Thy strongest Gates fast locked and barred,
Thy Martial and thy Civil powers
Are of themselves a ^^ender Guard.
Thy Armies and t^y Trained-bands,
Though raised, formed and paid by thee,
Are at the Lord of Hosts commands
To punishsin wheree'er it be.
And whilst that still increases more,
Strength makes them weak, and Riches poor.
17. Unless thy Palaces God builds,
On them is lost both cost and pain;
Unless that he the City shields,
Thy watchmen watch the same in vain:
To rise betimes, and sit up late,
Or eat thy daily Bread with care,
Secures not peace, life or estate,
Save where Gods Benedictions are.
It Is he alone, who safe does keep
Both when we wake, and when we sleep.
This between the 15 and 16.
My Warning men to take more heed,
When of their harm I was afraid,
Was paralleled with their mis-deed,
Who to betray them had assaid.
If thus I fare, for words well meant;
If Love must be repaid with wrongs;
To evil deeds with ill intents
What recompense of right belongs?
If this, with Friends, for Justice goes,
What can expected be from Foes?
FINIS.
