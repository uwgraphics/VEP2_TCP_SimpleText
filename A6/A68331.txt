And Judge me nocht, that I have done indyte,

And for the confort, of them that does repent,
As may all faithful, graip and als considder,

As God me Judge, quho knawis ye mind and thocht.
Of every wicht, that in this world is wrocht,
So to my Text, now breuelie to proceid,
Grit God me help, and with his spreit me speid.
The Diuisioun of the Text.
THis part of Text, quhilk I am to discyde,
In to two heads, will God I sall deuyde
The first head, the punyscheme^t sall be
Of wekit Synnaires, for their Iniquytie,
And specially, the torments heir I schaw,
Of them that dois, co^tem Gods wourd and Law,
And how the wekit, ar nocht ingraft in Christ,
Bot ar the Children, of the Antechrist,
The secund head, sall be the rich rewaird,
The Godly gettes, quhilk dois their God regaird
And how tha ar ingraft, in Christ Jesus,
Be the embracing, of his wourd most true. Iho. x^^

The Discriptioun of the First head.
SO now returnand till our first head agane,
Aduert, and e sall heir the crewell pane,
The sorrowful Sentence, and terribill decreit,
In to few wourdes, ar heir contenit compleit,
That is prepaird, for wekit Creaturs,
And vicius men, that in to Uice indurs,
For them that drowned ar in Idolatry,
For poysond pepill, with Infidelytie,
For stif contemnars, of gods lyuelie wourd,
This suthfast Sentence, allace it is no bourd.
It is no Sentence be Man retreattabill
It is no Sentence, be man debaittabill. Math. i. Peter Gla, iv^

It nowthair sparis, King nor Empriour,
Duke, Erll, Lord, nor pussant Conquyrour,
It nowthair sparis, mychtie men nor pure, Iere, i,

That of the wourd of God, doith tak no cure,
Bot is ane Sentence, quhilk none can do eschew,
That dois contem, the wourd of Christ Jesus,
This Sentence merkit, the pepill we discus,
That doith nocht abide in Christ Jesus.
Ane General Discriptioun of them that bydis nocht in Christ.
IN Christ tha bide nocht, we do understand,
The quhilk aggre^^g unto his command,
Dois nocht embrace, his wourd most louynglie,
With fervent mind, and heart most constantly,
And in that wourd, hes nocht ane solyde faith,
Their bydis nocht in Christ, the Scripture says,
Bot ar Inuoluit, in to dung hills of Sin,
And every day from Sin, to Sin tha rin,
It sufficis nocht, that we Baptizit be,
^hon. xv. ^ath. x. Tim. ii.
Bot it requyris als, of necessity,
That we contynew, in Christ's Euangell true,
Or else, we can nocht bide in Christ Jesus.
Ane Discriptioun of them in special that bydis nocht in to Christ.
THe Roman Kirk, and all of that degree,
^al. ii. and
Quhilk dois menteane peruerst Idolatry,
Sic as the Meise, quhilk is plane derogatioun,
To Christ's glore, and his most blissed Passioun,
With all the rabill, of tha Sophistes and Clerks,
That doith ascryue, Saluatioun to their werks
Or attributes Remissioun of their Sin,
To any wicht that is the world within,
Tha pepill I say, doith nocht abide in Christ.
Bot ar the Children of the Antechrist.
Their Temporesars, doith nocht in Christ abide
Neathir their schrinkars, that from ye treuth dois slide
^say. iii. (...). i.
Neathir their flattrers, that for feir of their bags,
Dois wag about aye, as the busse it wags,
Neathir tha pepill, that for feir of their lives,
^uc. ix. (...) xiiii. ^ath. x.
And tinsall of their houshaldes, bairnis and wives,
And lose of guds, gear, or wardlie rent
From Gods wourd, them selves doith absent
Nor tha that dois, for pleasure of their Prence,
(...). iiii.
Refuse Gods wourd, of may magnificence.
And sure it is, quho treulie list discydit,
God will nocht have, that man that is deuydit.
Bot he will have him Saul, and body haill,
Cor. vi.
Quho is deuydit, his faith doith nocht auaill.
Dissemblit pepill, doith nocht abide in Christ,
Bot ar the children of the Antechrist.
And as the faithful in Christ ingraftit be,
Be his Euangell, and wourd of Ueritie.
So is the Kirk malignant, but more plead, Iho. viii. and xv.

Ingraft in Satan, of that ilk kirk their head.
With dewillysche doctrine, and Idolatry,
Of them that speykes, leis, throw Ypocresie.
Of the Grievous Tormentis preordinat for the wekit.
QUhat end makes their, to proceid furthirmair,
Tha ar cast forth, yt Text this doith declair. Joan. xv.

May like ane branche, down cuttit of ane stok,
That is becum, ane dry and widderit blok.
Meit for no werk, that man wald do desire,
Bot to be brint, and cassin in ane fire.
Euin so the cursed Contemnares of the treuth,
And wekit wirkars, for their Sin and sleuth.
That will nocht do, the wourd of Christ embrace
Ar clean dryit up, from every kind of grace, Gal. v.

And hes no pairt with Christ, nor with his glore
Moir nor the widderit branche, the quhilk before
I said had Iusse, or Sapour of the tree,
Quhen it is cuttit, and dois from growing de.
Tha ar cum dry, with Lust and carnal heit
Because tha want, the Sapour of the spreit,
Of Christ Jesus, the Savior of man,
Wanting this Iusse, quhairfor ar tha meit than,
For nothing ellis, the text it schewis plane,
Bot to sustene, of Hellis fire the pane. Joan. x^ Exo. iiii vi.vii, v^

As Nero sufferit, for his tirrannye,
And Pharao for, his grit Ydolatrie.
And as the gluttoun, quho refusit Lazarus, Luc. ix.

With money mo, nor heir I may discus.
So thus the wekit, tha get no other hyre,
^hon. xv.
Bot for their Sin, ar brint in flam of fire,
Aye daily deand, and never it can de,
Math. iii. Esa. lxvi.
Thus ends the wekit, for their Iniquytie.
Bot lat ws heir, the text perfytlie feill,
And lat ws merk the wourdes thairof richt weill,
As quhair it sayis nocht, that, that man sall be,
Cast forth, that bydis nocht in Christ constantly,
^hon. iii. and. xv.
Bot speykand in the present time it sayis,
He is reieckit now instantly alwayis
Albeit on life, that it he leuand be,
He is cast forth, the text this latts ws se.
So heir the text, pronuncis till ws plat,
That Christ he speykis heir of the reprobat
For as the faithful, now leuyng heir but more,
Ar partakers, with Christ in heauinnis glore.
^hon. v.
And dois begin, their heauin in earth heir down,
Quhen as tha thole, soir persecutioun,
For richtyusnes, takand in patience,
^et. iiii.
All earthly trubill, knawand their Innocence,
Hayfand respect, and still in memore,
The heauinnis Joy, and grit felicite,
That they at last, be Christ ar till obtene,
Quhen as tha know, their conscience is clean,
Of sik Injury, as was their accusatioun,
This earthly trubill, is their grit consolatioun,
Quhilk consolatioun, it is the way full euin,
And pleasand passage, unto the port of heauin.
The quhilk begynnis, in to this wrachit ground
As in the Scripture, cleirlie may be found,
Quhair as it sayis, and writtin is expres,
Be money trublis, sorrowis and distres,
The godly sall in heauin, have their Intrance. Act. iiii.

Their to posses, their Just inheritance.
Euin so all they, to speyk in wourdes breue,
That godly will, in to Christ Jesus leave,
Man them addres, his Croce for to vptake ii Tim. iii.

And suffer persecutioun for his saike.
As the Appostiles, and Propheits nocht possessed,
The heauinnis glore, in earth with wardlie rest Heb. ii.

Bot sum tholit death, and sum richt sore torment,
Heir upon earth, or tha till heauin up went.
Directly speakand in the contrary,
Of wekit pepill, that leuis sinfullie.
To quhome also, is knawin the wourd of God,
And wilfully, dois rin the contrair rod.
In werk and wourd, in thocht, and in Intent
Express aganis the Lordis commandiment,
Contynewand thus, in their Sin and offense,
This man can never have peace in conscience, Heb. vi. and.x.

Quhilk peace quho wantes ye treuth most true to tell
Is the beginning of the paynis of Hell.
Quhilk paynis infernal, begynnis likewise we se
In to this earth, and Uaill of misery,
Quho wants this rest, and peace of conscience,
Of this may have, ane sure experience.
For quhill he leuis, his conscience tryis and berks,
Gods wraith to wrak him, for his wekit werks,
Quhen he is dead, his conscience sall accuse him,
And him condamp, quhair he hes done abuse him.
And as the faithful, now leuand heir on life,
Of all degree, both Infant, man and wife,
Hes now in Heauin, of Gods especial grace,
Ilk ane their awin, preparit roum and place.
So hes the wekit, leuand I ow tell,
Ilk ane their awin, appoyntit rowmes in Hell.
To tell quho ar, Eleckit or refusit,
I can nocht say, thairin hald me excusit.
Can nane their of, have sik experience,
As man him self, grapand his awin conscience.
Like as the man, that finds his life aggre,
To Gods command, and wourd of verite.
And hes ane fervent mind to perseueir,
Under the reull of Gods wourd sinceir,
Syne dois continue, as Gods word dois direc him,
That man may know, that God hes done elec him
And with the wekit, thocht still he be suspeckit,
it still the faithful, may count him as eleckit.
And in the contrair, account this for no bourd,
Quho dois contempne, of God the lyuelie wourd.
And dois menteine, peruerst Idolatry,
And will nocht cum, to heir the verity.
And quha that cu^mis to heir, and dois abuse it,
And quha hes hard, syne after dois refuse it,
Turnand as Tykes, unto their vomatyue,
As sum hes done, that leuand ar on live.
Contynewand this, in to their odius Sin,
Ending their lyuis, as than tha do begin.
Luc. xii.
I can nocht say, nor on na wayis excuse them,
Bot force man grant, yt God hes done refuse them
The Exhortatioun upon the First head.
QUhairfor I do, Imploir with humbill heart
Ilk man in earth, to ponder their awin part*
And to considder, in to quhat stait tha stand,
Quhidder with God, or contrair his command,
That he that stands, may stand, and nocht do fall, i. Cor. x.

And quho hes fallin, may know the sam at all.
Syne pray to God, in to most hartlie wise,
To grant them grace, up from their fall to rise,
And to contynew, in Christ's Euangell true,
And so Ingraftit, in to Christ Jesus,
This fer deir brether, sall stand for the first heid,
Nixt to the Secund, schortlie I proceid.
Heir endis the First Head. And followis the Secund head. With the Text thairof.
Give e abide in me, and my wourdis, also In to ow. Ask quhat e will. It sal be
done unto ow. Heirin is my Father Glorefyit. That e bring forth mekill Fructe,
and be maid my Disciplis. Johan. xv. etc.
THe Fructe the proffeit, and the commodytie
In to this gratius, and Godly Unity,
Betuix Christ Jesus, and his Kirk most true,
Lo Christ he dois heir furthirmore ensew,
To make the consolatioun the moir,
Of his Discyplis, he speaks the sam heirfoir,
And for to draw them till ane constancy,
He schewis them, the grit Utilitie,
That followis them, that in him dois abide,
In to few wourds, he dois the sam discyde.
Christ sayis their wourds, gyf e will bide in me,
Thairthrow e sall obtene grit proffittes three.
Bot quhat ar tha? that dois in Christ remane, Joan x^

Tha kind of pepill, the Text declaris plane.
Euin tha it sayis, that dois my wourdes embrace, i. Ioa^ ^.

Tha same in me, tha have ane dwelling place,
^^an. viii
And tha be faith, in me ar still Ingrauit,
And I in them, thai^^^row rychtso consauit,
So this Coniunctiou^, and this Unity,
Betuix Christ Jesus, and his Kirk trewlie,
Joan. ii.
Is be no meanis, bot be his wourd imbrasing,
And it in to their Inwert Bowelles placing
^om. iii. ^^d.
As was of Abraham, and money faithful mo,
Go cearche the Scripture, and thou sall find it so.
^oan. ii.
We find nocht heir, the Paip that Antechrist,
Doith ws Conione, unto our Master Christ
Nor we perceive, nocht heir that our ingrauyng
Is in to Christ, be our Byschopis receauyng,
As be Annoynting, and schauing of our Croun,
We find nocht heir, sic vain Coniunctioun,
Joan. ii.
Bot only finds ws, Ingraft in Christ Jesus,
Iho. ii.
Be the imbrasing, of his wourd most true.
And quho so thus, with Christ Conioynit be,
May be assurit, to get their proffittes three,
The quhilk in ordour, as tha stand in the Text
I sall declair, Ilkane till vthir Annexed.
The first Commodite of them that abydis in to Christ. The Text. Ask quhat e
will. It sall be geuin unto ow.
^oan. xv.
FIrst, in this Spiritual Unioun we have,
Quhat richtius thing of Christ yt we sal crave,
Quhat better thing can man seik for his hyre,
Nor get all thing, he Justly will desire,
No better thing can onye crayf or wys,
In to this earth, on life that leuing is.
Nor have all thingis, to them performit and done,
That Godly is, be the grit God abone, Joan. xi i. Joan.

For the imbrasing of his wourd most true,
And so to be Ingraft in Christ Jesus.
I count them daft, and mekill wors nor mad,
That laykes this gift, so lichtlie may be had,
Sekand the sam, upon ane other ground,
Quhllk be no other manner can be found.
Sen Christ hes promised, this to his faithful all
Be this Coniunctioun, and Unioun Spiritual,
I say, it is bot verraye Uanytie, Joan. v. ^t. xvi,

For to desire, Christ with ws corporally.
It is the Spreit, that quyknis auld and ing,
The corporal flesche, it proffittis no thing,
Without sayis Christ, my body do ascend,
The Confortour, to ow I can nocht send,
Thus it behouit, Christ of necessity,
Unto the Father, to pass up reallie. Mar. vi Luc. iiii. Joan. xi Heb. x. Act.
vii. Joan. xv

Quhair he abydis, and ever sall remane,
Quhill he descend to Judge the world agane.
For vthirwyse, gyf Christ had nocht ascendit,
The holy Ghost till ws, had nocht discendit.
Thou can not Papist, be Scripture make it kend
That Christ sensyne, did corporally descend,
How is it than? thou thinks no schame to le,
To say thou makes him, and eytes him carnally.
Now may it heir, be sperit and demandit,
And good it were, that we should vnderstandit,
Quhat is the cause? the Kirk Papisticall,
Can never have this Unioun Spiritual,
Of Christ Jesus, trewlie in them ingrauit,
The cause is this, sa fer as I perceauit,
That so lang as tha seyk him carnally, Joan. vi

^^th. xvi.
Tha can no wayis, posses him Spirituallie,
As the Appostilles believing Christ to ring,
^ath. xvi xv.
In earth, amangs them as ane temporal King.
So lang as tha, of this had Esperance,
Tha ever leuit still, in Ignorance.
^^an. viii. (...). ix.
And never knew, quhat Christ meant in his teaching
For all his daily and contynewall preaching,
No moir sall never no carnal Creature,
So lang as tha sall fleschelie Folks Endure
^or. ii.
Cum to the knowledge, and intelligence,
Of Gods wourd, and Spiritual pure sentence.
Thocht Angels were, to preach it to them plane,
Preue quho so please, their laubour sall be vane.
Now falls it weill, to us to wey but moir,
(...). ii.
Quhat was the cause, the reasoun and quhairfoir
The Papistis said, tha maid Christ Reallie,
In to their Mess, and Eat him carnally.
As I perceive, it was that tha and thairs,
Mycht stylit be, most holy God makairs
And thairthrow cum to warldlie Pomp and gloir
Richt as tha did, for nane micht clim to moir.
For Papis precellit, the Kings in Dignytie,
And Kings they seruit, with all Humilytie.
And Cardinals, was Companeonis to our Kings,
For with my Eis, my self did se their things.
This mouit them, that werk till Interpryse,
Quhilk montit them, on sic ane prydfull wise.
And thocht su^ schaifling wald have ilk nycht in cure
Ane Co^cubyne, ane Harlote, or ane Hure,
With gaping, Iowking, with money bek and nod,
Upon the morn, he wald have maid ow God.
Sa like, sa like, as it was true to be
Quhen nane of them, could make ane lytill fle.
And it no schame, to tak in hand tha thocht,
To make grit God, quhilk maid all thing of nocht,
Grit God we pray, sen Prencis wald perceive,
And it in to their hearts deiplie grave,
How be tha Iuglours tha have been blindlynes led
With deuillysche Doctrine, fosterit and fed.
Na dout good Lord, bot than tha wald refuse it,
Quhen as tha knew, how tha have been abuse it.
Ane Questioun Direct to all Papistis demanding gyf Christ can be Separet from
the Faithful.
CAn Christ be from them, yt he do still support
And grants to them, their will in lauchfull sort,
No their is none, of Judgment discreit, Matthew. xxviii.

Can say, bot he is present in the Spreit,
Still in to them, that are his true Eleckit, Esaias. xlv. Psalm. c.xx.ix.

Least tha alwayis, with Sin should be subieckit,
I mean with, grit and odious transgressioun,
Siclyke as thift, reif, murthour, and oppressioun,
For thocht yt richtyus, doith seuin times daily Sin,
it dois he nocht, contynew still thairin,
For be his Spreit, Christ geuis them Judgment
To know their Sin, syne maks them to repent.
So that tha do nocht, in their Sin delight,
Bot murnis thairfor, with conscience contryte,
As David, Peter, and the Magdalene,
With money mo, nor heir I may contene.
Christ als is with them, as Uicar general, Heb. i.

Rewlar, and gydar, of the faithful all.
Without quhais spreit, no good thing ca^ be wrocht,
Without his help, our strenth aualis nocht.
In him we leave, and mouis quhill we endure, Act. xvii.

It is he only, that taks on ws cure,
Thus none can say, but Christ most certanlie,
Is be his Spreit, with ws contynewallie.
So till his Kirk, Christ heir before his Passioun,
Repeates their wourdis? to gyf them consolatioun,
^oan. xiiii
That tha in that, should nocht discuragit be,
For his deperting from them corporally.
Matthew. ^xviii.
Bot be his Spreit, he promised still support them,
So on this wayis, Christ Jesus did confort them,
Howbeit sayis he, I am to pass abone,
Ask quhat e will, it sall to ow be done,
Prouyding alwayis, that e constant be
Abiding at my wourd of Uerite.
This consolatioun dois serve for ws also,
Assuring ws, quhair ever we ride or go,
^om. xv.

He ever is with ws, present in the spreit.
^uc. xxi. ^athew. viii.

As he hes promised, unto the wardlis end.
Now have e herd, the first commodity,
The rich rewaird, and grit utility,
Breiflie discussit, of them that are ingrauit,
In to Christ Jesus, and how it is conceauit,
Now herkin fordwart, and e sall schortlie heir,
The Secund proffeit, discussit in ordour cleir.
The Discriptioun of the Secund Commodity of them that abydis in Christ. The
Text. Heirin is my Father Glorifyit, that e bring forth mekill fruct. etc.
THe Secund proffeit, we sal bring forth good fruit
^oan. xv.
And of good works sal not be destitute
That dois Gods wourd, into their hearts embrace, Math. v.

Making it their, to have ane dwelling place.
For as the day, can nocht be without lycht,
Nor the cleir Sone, withouttin beams bricht,
The flammyng fire, without Calyditie,
Or without water, can be the raging Se,
No more the godly, as writtes cunnyng Clerks,
Can gudlie be, withouttin godly works.
With quhilks tha do the Father glorefie,
That ringand is, in to the Heauin most hie.
This fruit but dout, tha ar the godly deids, Iaco. ii.

Quhilk from Christ Jesus, the faithful wine, proceids,

Sinceirlie Preacheit, to every Creature.
Be quhilk men ar, conuertit specially,
From Sin and Uice, and from Ydolatrie.
To godlynes, quhairin the Lord delyts,
As Paul in his Epistills plainly dyts. Ephe. v. Col. iii.

Their Godly fruts, dois also notefie,
Gyf we the faithful, and Germane branchis be,
Of Christ Jesus, quha is the only wine,
That did Redeem, our Saul's all from pyne. Joan. xv.

Quho wants their fruts, lat them all talking sta^che
And nev count yaim of christ, to be a bra^che
Bot lat thaim grant, yaim branchis Imps and sperks Math. v,

To be of Satan, seeing their sinful werks.

O Fie on ow, that callis our selffs professors,
Syne notit ar, for manifest transgressors, Matthew. xxiii.

Gods wourd is heauylie sclanderit for our cause,
Seeing e do nothing observe his Lawis,

Throw our ungodly, and vicius behauyng.
Quhat sayis the pure? behalding our tra^sgression
Grit God preserve ws from this lewd professio^n
Is this Gods wourd, that learnis them this evil
It semis rather, this wourd cu^mis of the Devil,
Were it Gods wourd, we mycht rycht weill be sure,
Tha wald nocht in sic deuylrie endure.
Puffed up in pride, sik as was never seen,
Before, with any mortal mannis Eine.

Upon ane pair, of profane Monstruus hose.
Nor wald do cleith, ane hundredth of the pure,
That gois nakit, begging from dure to dure.

Or any point, of the Appostilles preaching.

And brings Kingdoms to confusioun.
For Pride Lucypheir from Heauinnis glore he fell

And daily is tormentit in the Hell.
With money thousands of his oppynnioun,
Throw verray pride, from Heauin with him fell down
^xo. xiiii.
Pharao for pride, was drownit in the Seye,
With all his Horsis, and crewell Company.
Sennacherib, for all his bost and schore,
^. Reg. xix
Was put to flycht, syne be his Sone forlore.
And Nabuchodonezer, for his Pride,
^ani. iiii.
As Daniell, dois distinclie weill discyde.
Was for his hicht transformit in ane beist,
Quhill he agane of lawlynes did taist
Granting him self to be ane mortal wicht,
And God allone, to be the Lord of micht.
In to the buke, of Hester is declaird,
How on that gallous, proud Aman had prepaird, Hester

To put good Merdocheus to the dead
Him self was hangit withouttin moir remead,
This to be schort, quho list to pride pretend
May be assurde, of ane mischeuous end.
And in the contrair, quha wald exaltit be, Pro. xv ^ath. Joan. ^

Bot Gods blissing, sall lycht upon his head,
That lates it forth, that pure men may get bread.

I neid nocht rekkin our filthye Harlotrie,
It is so knawin, our alquhair oppinlie
Quhilk to rehearse, It maks me abhor,

With fire from Heauin, consumit was with as.

For money ane time, and daily it is seen,
How sic vile harlotes, for Hurdome Plagit been,
With most extreme, and urgent poverty, Luc. xi Pro. ix.xxix. Job. ii i. Cor.

Loyssing for ever, their honor and their fame,
And sumtyme plagit, be God with suddand dead,
Bot quho that list, with wisdom to take head,
May daily merk, and als perfytlie se,
The Harlotes oftymes, plagit with all three.

Quhill Saul and body, be damnit to hellis pane. Gal. v, Apoc. x i. Cor. ^

For tha perceive nocht, that their Misery,
Dois licht on them, for their Iniquytie.
Bot rycht as Pharao, on Gods plaigs wald not pance
Bot thocht tha come, be fortune and be chance
No moir the Harlot, can think his heart within,
That God dois plaig him for his filthy Sin,
And so as Paleartes in Peltrie perseueiris,
Quhill of their strenth, consumit be the eris.
The pure Plewme^, and laubouraris of our lands,
Quhen tha have nocht, to fill our gredie hands.

Howbeit the first have Barnis aucht or nine,

Thus schift e our, in to most gredie wise,

And all this is, for to setfurth our pride,

Quho list the Story of Achab to persew,
And Iesabell his wife, that Naboth slew,
For his wine aird, throw gredie Couatyce, ii Reg. xx

And maid them both, most miserably to de,
For their foul Murthour, and Cupeditie.
Saul lost his Kingdom throw his gredines, i Reg. xiii.

And rich Naball, for his grit churlyschenes,

And measit David, verray Prudentlie,

For any fence, the churlysche Carll could make,
As sall all wrachit Churlis, layf their geir, Eccl. v. et xiiii.

And vtheris thairof, sall make mirrye cheir.

All wrachis wrak, thus endis to conclude.

Bot verray few, of Abygalles to find.
Paul dois pronunce, in wourdes plane and euin, i. Cor. v. et vi.

That Couatus men, sall nocht inherit Heuin,
And dois forbid, that we expreslie,

Or God ane sudand plaig, sall on ow send,
And punysche ow, be fer moir creuellie,

Without e mend may certainly I say ow,

Because with ow, it is nothing regardit
Thairfor with God, e sall be so rewardit,
That uncouth Strangears, of ane forene Natioun

For Disobedience, unto Gods wourd,
e sall be Plagit, with Hunger, Pest, and swourd
With Hirschip, Fire, with Dearth, and Pestelence,
Esa. xxiiii
Because e Sin, aganis our Conscience,
For Gods wourd, was never moir trewlie teachit,
Nor it is now, in money placis preachit,
And never sa money ungodly pepill seen
In to this earth, sen it Inhabit been.
Quhairfor gyf e grit God wald glorefie,
Embrace his wourd, and learn to fructefie, Joan. xv

And lat our werks, and wourds aggre togidder,
That every man, may graip and als considder,
It is Gods wourd, and pure Religioun,
That e observe, in our professioun.
Quhat helpis it, thocht we the wourd profess
Except the Fruit proceid ^hairof express.
Thus lat our deids, so schyne in times to cum, Iac. i.

Tha sall be seen, and kend till all and sum,
That the Behaldars, may cry with Joyful steuin,

So quhen our werks, dois with our wourds aggre Joan. xv

No dout e sall, the Father glorefie.
The secund proffit, rycht as our Text it merks
Tuytching the bringing forth, of Godly werks,
With faithful Pepill, that dois their God regaird,
Semplie I have, heir in few wourds declaird
So that their rests, of this mateir no mair,
Bot the third proffit, only to declair,
Quhilk schortlie now be Gods grace I sall end
Gyf ears heirfor, and to my wourds attend.
Followis the Third Proffit of them that abydis in to Christ. The Text. And be

THe third, and Final last Commodity,
The true Discyplis of Christ we sall all be, Joan. xv

That bydis in Christ, and Christ's wourd in to them
My Text, this Sentence plainly dois declame,
Be the quhilk wourdes, merking ye circumstance
Heir is requyrit? ane ferme contynewance, Joan. xv

In to Gods wourd, compleitlie to our end,
Gyf we his true Discyplis wald be kend.
Inconstant men, my Text heir plane declaris,
Naue for to be, of Christ's true Scolaris,
Bot tha ar Christ Discyplis to conclude,
That will conferme, his Doctrine with their blude,
As quhen it cu^mis to that Extremite,
For to Renunce, Christ's Uangell or to de,
And chusis than, to suffer fire and swourd,
Rather nor to renunce his Heauinly wourd.
As did the Prophets, and Mertyris money one
With the Appostilles, in to the dayis bygone,
And in our dayis, rycht money we did se,
For Christ's wourd, do suffer pacientlie.
May cruel death, and mycht have had their lives
With eirlie rentes to them, their barnis and wives,
Gyf tha the wourd of God, wald have refusit,
Tha did nocht swa, bot bitter death tha chusit.
All their Discyplis, hes this rewaird heirfore,

Tha sall have pairt with Christ in Heauinnis glore,
As dois the promeis of Christ till ws propone,
In the Euangell, of the Apostill Ihone.
^oan. xvii
Quhair to the father Christ, speykand specially
Saya^d their wourds, quhom thou hes geuin to me
I will that tha, their be with me also,
And se my glore in Heauin, quhair I sall go,
So this last proffit the rest dois fer transcend
That is Eternal, and never sall have end.
Should lose of guds, life, or feir of pyne,
Math. x.
Make ws this Heauinlie Thesaure for to tyne
Quhat is it wourth, to man to win but more,
^at. xvi.
The haill world, wanting the Heauinnis glore.
All earthly things, tha ar bot transitory,
Except this Heauinlie, and Celestial glory,
Quhilk be no other meanis can be possessed,
Except Gods wourd, in to our hearts tak rest.
That death to man, it is grit consolatioun,
The quhilk dois lead, the Saul unto saluatioun.
Bot verray feirfull, and dolent is that dead,
That dois the Saul, unto Damnatioun lead.
With Deligence, now lat ws all heirfore,
Embrace Christ Jesus, that we may cum to glore,
And in times cu^ming, lat none so ernistlie pance
On earthly glore, that lestes bot ane glance.
Bot lat our laubour, study and Meditatioun,
Be ever bent, to seik for our Saluatioun,
And deiplie in our hearts, lat ws considder,
None can serve God, and Ma^mone boith togidder.
Woe worth ye lands, ye gudes, gear, and flesche,
That dois man from, this heavenly glore depesche,
To the quhilk glore, now breiflie to conclude,
Mot bring ws Christ, that bocht ws with his blude.
So be it.

The Lame^taioun Of the Pure. Twiching the Miserabill Estait of this Present
World. Compylit be William Lauder. At Perth. Primo Fabruarie. 1568.
THis world is war nor ever it was,
Full of myscheif, and all malure:
Falls and fragell as the glass,
How lang Lord sall, this world endure.
For money dois Gods word profes,
Bot for to keip it, few takis cure:
They ar so bent to weikitnes,
How lang Lord will this world endure.
Now every fat Sow, feidis ane other,
And few hes pity on the Pure:
Couatice gydis, and rewlis the Ruder,
How lang Lord will this world endure.
The men quhome God hes rychelie dotit,
Abhorris the emptye Creature:
Cheiflie Protestants, lat ws notit,
How lang Lord will, this world endure.
it ar nocht their, Protestants true,
Bot Ipocretis, I am most sure:
That hes renuncit Christ Jesus,
How lang Lord will, this world endure.
From fraud, falset, and from gyle,
No Preaching can the pepill allure:
Lawtie, and luife, ar in exile,
How lang Lord will, this world endure.
Hipocrasie vain Glore, and Pride,
Now blawis their Bugillis, strange and sture:
Simplysitie, is set on side,
How lang Lord will, this world endure.
The reuth that Papistis hes I say,
On them that beggis from dure to dure:
Sall ws accuse, on Domesdaye,
How lang Lord will this world endure.
Now money vsis Sosserie,
Doand the deuylis of Hell conjure:
Seikand to know, how all sulde be,
How lang Lord will, this world endure.
Justice is rowpit, as vtheris waris,
This is most plane, and nocht obscure:
The pure Pepill it declaris,
How lang Lord will, this world endure.
The falsest Actioun, that may be,
Sall no wayis want ane Procuture:
The Devil he will, get one for fe,
How lang Lord will, this warlde endure.
Loud leand Lowreis for their sleuth,
Was treatit passing throw moss and Mure:
Upon true Preacheoures, few hes reuth,
How lang Lord will, this world endure.
Credit and frist, is quyte away,
No thing is lent, bot for Usure:
For every penny, they will have tway,
How lang Lord will, this world endure.
For auld kyndnes, thou sall nocht get,
Bot Magerie, Malice, and Iniure:
Auld good done dedis, ar quyte foret,
How lang Lord will, this world endure,
The dayntie Dammis, may nocht sustene,
The faithful for, to fyle their sture:
Bot treatis them, yt tryit trumpoures been,
How lang Lord will this world endure.
Ane feneit flatterair, or Fuile I say,
Ane Barde, ane Bragger, or Bordell Hure:
Ar none treatit, so weill as they,
How lang Lord will, this world endure.
In all the earth, is no thing were:
In to no earthly Creature:
Nor heicht into ane Minister,
How lang Lord will, this world endure.
it Papistis bearis ilke ane to other,
More liberal luife, I am most sure:
Nor dois sum Minister to his Brother,
How lang Lord will, this world endure.
And now the Dochter and the Sone,
Lichtlyis the Mother, that them bure:
And forettis quhat, their Father hes done,
How lang Lord will, this world endure.
Of this Iniure and dispyte,
Wrocht of all cankerit Creature:
I say Gods wourd, hes nocht the wit,
How lang Lord will, this world endure.
For to behauld this Misery,
My breist in baill, it dois combure:
Sen reuth is none, nor it Pity,
How lang Lord will, this world endure.
Sen all Estaitis, this gois astray,
Lat no man think, bot this is sure:
That God will Plaig ws but delay,
For thus we can nocht lang endure.
Quhairfore, lat every Creature,
The Mercyis of grit God procure:
That we may ones Embrace the Lycht
Of Heauin, quhilk ever sall endure.
FINIS.
Quod Lauder.
