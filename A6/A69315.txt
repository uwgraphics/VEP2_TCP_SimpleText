A proclamation against the irreverent disputers and talkers, of the Sacrament
of the body and blood of Christ commonly called the Sacrament of the altar,
set forth by this Kyngys a^^^^^^ie with the (...) and consent of his most dear
^ncle, Edward Duke of (...) (...) of (...) most royal person and of his
(...) amd subjects (...) of his highness most honorable pryuey
counsel*.x^vii. day of D^ (...) the (...) year of his Majesty's most
gracious reign.
Where as the Kings highness has of late with thassent and consent of the
lords Spiritual and Temporal, and theco^mons in the Parliament, held
the.iiij. day of November, in the first year of his most gracious reign, made
a good and Godly act and estatute against those, who does comte^pne, despise,
or with unseemly and ungodly words deprave and deuyle the holy Sacrament of
the body and blood of our Lord, commonly called the Sacrament of ye Altar,
and in the same estatute, has most prudently declared by all the words and
terms, which scripture speaks of it what is undoubtedly to be accepted,
believed, taken and spoken, by and of the said Sacrament: Yet this
notwithstanding, his Majesty is advertised, that some of his subjects not
contented with such words and terms, as scripture does declare thereof, nor
with that doctrine, which the holy Ghost by the Evangelists, and saint
Paul has taught us, do not cease to move contentious and superfluous
questions of the said holy Sacrament and soupper of the Lord, entering rashely
into the discussing of the high mystery thereof, and go about in their sermons
or talks arrogantly to defyne the manner, nature, fashion, ways, possibility
or impossibility of those matters, which neither make to edification, nor God
has not by his holy word opened: Which persons not contented, reverently
and with obedient faith, to accept that in the said Sacrament, according to
the saying of saint Paul, the bread is the communion or partaking of the body
of our Lord, The wine likewise the partakinge of the blood of Christ, by the
words instituted and taught of Christ and that the body and blood of Jesus
Christ is there, which is our comfort thanks giving, louetoken of Christ's
love toward us and of ours, as his me^bres within our self, searches and
strives irreverently whether the body and blood aforesaid is there, really, or
figuratly, locally, or circu^ scriptly, and having quantity and greatness, or
but substantially, and by substance only, or else but in a figure and manner of
speaking, whether his blessed body be there head, legs, arms, toes and
nails, or any other ways, shape and manner, naked or clothed, whether he is
broken and showed, or he is always whole, whether the bread there remains as
we se, or how it departs, whether the flesh be there alone and the blood, or
part, or each in other, or in the one both, in the other but only blood and
what blood, that only, which did flow out of the side, or that, which
remained, with other such irreuere^t superfluous and curious questions which
(how, and what, and by what means, and in what form) may bring into them
which of human and corrupt curiosity, has desire to search out such
mysteries, as lies did in the infinite and botomeles deapth of the wisdom
and glory of God, and to the which our human imbecillitie cannot atteine and
therefore oftetymes turns the same to their own and others destruction, by
contention and arrogant rashenes: which simple and Christian affection,
reverently receiving, and obediently believing, without further search, takes
and uses to most great comfort and profit: for reformation whereof and to
the intent, that further contention, tumulte and question might not rise emonge
the kings subjects, the Kings highness, by the advice of the lord Protector
and other his Maiestics counsel, strayghtly wills and commands, that no
manes person, from hensf^^^h do in any wise contenciously and openly argue,
dispute, reasone, preach or teach, affirmyng any more terms of the said
blessed Sacrament, then be expressly taught in the holy scrip^^^^ (...)
