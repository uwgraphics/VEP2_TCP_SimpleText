Gout Raptures. ASTPOAIA. OR AN Historical Fiction OF A War among the Stars:
Wherein are mentioned the 7 Planets, the 12 Signs of the Zodiac, and the 50
Constellations of Heaven mentioned by the Ancients. Also several eminent Stars,
and the most principal parts and lines of the Celestial Globe with their
Natures and Uses are pointed at. Useful for such as apply themselves to the
Study of Astronomy, and the Celestial Globe. By Robert Witty, Dr. in Physic.

To my friendly Reader.
BEing in a fit of the Gout in my hands and feet, so as I could not handle a
pen, or turn over the leaves of a Book, I happened to fall into a contemplation
of the Celestial bodies, to wit, the Stars and Constellations in Heaven, with
their Motions, Aspects and other accidents that are ascribed to them by
Astronomers; and the Subject running much in my mind, I fancied that it might
be pleasant to make an Historical fiction of a war among the Stars, and not
improperly, since all Astronomers do agree that there are inimicitious Aspects
among them, as well as amicable; and the nature and influences which are
ordinarily ascribed to them, whether they be the Planets or fixed
Constellations, render them as contrary each to other.

This set my fancy on work to invent an occasion of difference among them; Now
Saturn being called by Astronomers Infortunium majus, (or the great misfortune)
and Capricorn his day-house being in Opposition to Cancer, where the Moon is
said to be the Lady, and to be most dignified, or to have the chief Dominion, I
pitched the breach of peace in the Opposition that is betwixt those two Houses,
which are ordinarily called the two Tropicks, and consequently in his
Opposition to Luna, as quarrelling at her ruling of the Night because of her
female Sex, and so at all the rest of that Sex in Heaven; and thereupon to
fortify himself in Capricorn and Aquarius, which is the next Sign, and called
his night-house: And Mars whom Astronomers call Infortunium minus (or the less
misfortune) to come into Conspiracy with him, as also the great Centaure a
Southern Constellation, consisting of a great many eminent Stars; and these to
bring in forces from their several Quarters, unto the Conspiracy of Saturn.

Luna being in Cancer rises in Opposition, Jupiter which is the principal Star
of all and called Fortuna major (or the greater Fortune) is startled at it, and
sends forth his Scouts the Eagle and the little Dog to make discovery of them.
Then he called a Council of all the Constellations that bear the Names of men,
some of which we find mentioned in the Scriptures.

By their advice he raises two Armies, the one a standing Army, of the fixed
Stars, the other a flying Army of the Planets; The War is proclaimed by the
roaring of the Lion, and seconded by all the Celestial Cattle and Birds, who do
every one send forth an Alarm in their proper tones. Then he sets upon the
Rebels, to whom he found joined in confederacy all the Fiends of Hell, and the
Idols and Heathen gods in Taurus, who had now declared another cause of the war.

Then began the fight, where Jupiter did severe execution upon the
Confederates, and then pursued the Rebels, who fly before him from Sign to
Sign, till coming in Scorpio, (which is said by Astronomers to respect the
Secrets, and to incline those in whose Nativities it happens to be in the
Horoscope unto lust) Cupid with an enchanted Arrow, which he is feigned to shoot
of Sagittary (which is a Sign formed in the Globe like an Archer) into the Sign
Scorpio, puts an end to the war, and by force of the enchantment they fall in
Love one with another. Mars and Venus are in Conjunction: Mercury prefers Cupid
before all the Gods; Vulean takes Mars and Venus in his net; Jupiter courts
Danae and Alcumena; Saturn courts Luna; she applies to Sol, who is King of the
Planets, and of all the rest of the Stars, and is fancied to have been chaced
out of Heaven, till Jupiter had gone through the 12 Signs to scour out the
Rebels, who he does pass through in the space of 12 years. Sol by a Northern
Constellation is called home again, and by degrees setles all things in peace
and quietness.

In many things the Story may seem to run parallel to the late Transactions in
this Kingdom, especially toward the latter end, referring to his Majesty's
most happy Restoration, and many circumstances that attended it, although it
cannot be expected that Similitudes should run of four feet, and quadrate in
every punctilio: And herein I hope the Fancy will offend no man, especially not
my Superiors, whom in every capacity I profess my self ready to serve, and do
endeavor never to disoblige.

But in this feigned Story I have taken occasion to mention all the Planets,
with their Natures and Properties, the 12 Signs of the Zodiac, and the 50
Constellations which were noted by the Ancients, especially by Aratus the Greek
Poet in his (...).

I add also some other Names of principal Stars, and other parts of Heaven real
and imaginary, whereof frequent mention is made by Astronomers in their
writings; likewise I point at several of the principal Lines and parts of the
Celestial Globe, which being brought into Order by way of History (though
feigned) may conduce to help the memory in the study of Astronomy, and the use
of the Globe. And this I have done in English, Latin and Greek with propriety
of words according to my module. And the fancy being projected, and a great
many Staves made while I was in the Gout, I call Gout Raptures, which
afterward as my other occasions would permit, I went on with and finished.

If any man say, it was time not so well spent as it might have been, I think
so too, yet it was not so ill spent, as perhaps a rigid Momus or a Melancholic
Person may suppose. Aratus whom I mentioned before to have writ on the Subject,
was in high esteem for that Poem among both Ancient and Modern Writers, on
which piece many Greek Writers have made their Scholia or Animadversions, as
Theon, Eratosthenes, Ptolomy, Hesychius, Proclus, Hyginus, Achilles Tatius, and
as some Learned Men report three times as many more; besides an abundance of
Latin Authors, as Germanicus Caesar, Cicero, Ovid, Avienus, Paulus Gallucius,
etc. and several of our Countrymen: But above all, I find that St. Paul had
not only read this Poem of his, but in his Sermon at Athens, Acts 17. ver. 28.
he cites a passage out of it (...), and is part of the 5th verse in Aratus;
which may suffice among reasonable men to give credit not only to my Author,
but also to the Subject here treated of, to wit, the Stars and Constellatitions
in Heaven.

If any man strain at the Verse which is not in the usual mode, let him read
the Lyrick Poets in Greek, who I think have taken more liberty then I, both as
to measure and meeter; besides my fancy was to imitate an old sort of verse
well known to all Cantabrigians made in English, Latin and Greek, from whence
I took the Notion --

I know more then Apollo,
for as he laid a sleeping,
I saw the Stars at mortal jars,
and Vulcan was a weeping, etc.
and further I am sure, I might have done the same much more easily in
Heroicks, wherein I had not been bound up so strictly to Rithm, or Meeter.

If any object that it is but a fiction, let such consider well of Jothams
Parable, Judges 9. or of the Story of Dives and Lazarus, and several which
might be mentioned; nothing being more usual both in Sacred and Profane
writings, then to teach by way of fictions, and point out serious things in
Parables. Thus we find the Learning of the Ancients did consist very much in
Mythologie, and ours is employed in the frequent use of Tropes and Figures,
which without the annulling of that most noble Art of Rhetoric, we cannot lay
aside.

If any man quarrel at some unpolisht expressions in the English Copy, which he
fancies might have been better phrased; Let such know, I am not conceited of
any thing here said, nor had he been troubled with the view of them, if I had
not been overcome with the importunity of some friends of sufficient Learning,
who thought they might be useful to the public, which we ought all to serve;
But I do express my self and my sense of things in such words, as did then best
suit my Genius, that the three Languages might explain one another. Besides it
may be I do purposely make choice of such Expressions to point out some Terms
of Art, referring to Astronomy, or somewhat in the Globe which I design to
explicate, and then I hold to the sense in all the versions, reserving to each
Language its proper Idiome: And herein I do willingly submit to the judgment of
such as understand them all, rather then to the carping censure of such as know
nothing more then their own Mothers tongue.

Take it as it is, if it may profit or delight any ingenious Reader, I have my
design; and if by endeavors herein I do but little good to others, yet this is
great good to me, that by my labor herein I have kept my self in Action, and
so do neither hurt to others, nor receive any to my self. In the mean time as I
spent not much time in doing it (for I did it at idle hours, and in my
journeys) so thereby I employed my fancy in the study of the Globe, and of the
Languages, especially of the Greek, wherein I should be glad still to make
further improvement.

subito increpitaverit, ut omnes in eodem statu, quasi in Saxa obriguerint, fixi
permaneant, dum ille prolongato ex industria haustu se proluens, caeteros
interea toti Sodalitio propinat deridendos. Historiam Medusae inde recipient,
quam ob insignem pulchritudinem, praecipue ob crines aureos nitide crispatos
Neptunum deperisse aiunt, and in Minervae Templo comprestisse. Hujus vero
capillos irata Dea in angues mutabat, hoc superaddito incantamento, ut
quicunque eam inspicerent in lapides statim converterentur. Ejus autem Caput a
Perseo antedicto, Jovis and Danaes Filio, detruncatum, cum eo inter Sydera
collocatur.
90. Qui mox bibens Medusam
instituebat ritum,
Ut immota stent Sydera
nec variarent situm.
Hoc respicit Honorem a Serenissimo Rege Albemarliae Duci collatum, and Stellam
quo Equitum nobilissimorum summi Ordinis auratae Periscelidis decorantur
pallia, cui proprie Jovis Epitheton addi queat, si ita dignissimis Armorum
Regibus videretur congruum.
91. Fidelibus Athletis
dat tesseras Favoris,
Stellam Jovis dignissimis
insigne vult honoris.
92. Diploma jam Regale
profert sacrata mente,
Tam Veniae quam Amnestiae
pro quovis delinquente.
93. Nec sane hos tumultus,
nec bella recitarem,
Ni eximiam Clementiam
Regis ut decantarem.
94. In his Astronomorum
silentio favete;
Haec ratio, solummodo
ego vidi, Valete.
