VIENNA'S Triumph; WITH THE Whigg's Lamentation For the Overthrow of the TURKS.
To the Tune of, Now now the fight's done.
^

NOw now is the Siege raised,
and the numerous Train
Of the Turks, Jove be praised,
are Defeated again:
Their Mahomets aid,
they in vain did implore,
And they swear they will not trust
the dull God any more:
The Sham of the Lodestone,
at last they have found,
And their God is Condemned
to be laid under ground.
II.
Let the English give praise,
let all Christendom join,
In singing of Lays,
to the Powers Divine,
Vienna once more
has the Victory won,
And the TVRKS though so mighty
are put to the run:
The Giant Goliath
by David was slain,
Thus who fight against Heaven,
do fight but in vain.
III.
The Grand Vizier's fled,
in vain he did boast,
And 'twill cost him his Head,
since the Battle he lost:
His many of Thousands,
he Invincible thought,
Yet they by few hundreds,
to Confusion were brought;
To the great King of Poland,
let the Honor redound,
Whose actions with Credit,
and Fame do abound.
IV.
To the Duke of Lorrain,
great praises are due,
Who had Fought but in vain,
if proud words had proved true:
At the Emperor's Threats,
he laughed in his sleeve,
And all his great proffers,
he scorned to believe:
But Great as he was,
he withstood all their Charms,
Choosing rather to dye
in his Country-mens Arms.
V.
His Loyalty true
all the World does admire,
But the Whiggs who look blue,
and Commotions desire:
Ruin and strife is
Whiggs Element still,
They Are an obstinate People,
if crossed in their Will:
And what their Will is,
is as hard to be known,
As it is to find out
the Philosophers Stone.
VI.
No Devotion but theirs,
all others they say,
Of the Devil are Snares,
for to lead us astray:
The Pope to avoid,
they will do what they can,
And instead of an Image,
they will Worship a Man:
To the Turks they no Martyrs
but Converts would be,
But in time we may see
them all dye by the Tree.
Printed for J. Deacon, at the Sign of the Angel in Guiltspur-street. 1683.
