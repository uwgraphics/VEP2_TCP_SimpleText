Piety Promoted BY FAITHFULNESS, Manifested by several TESTIMONIES Concerning
that true Servant of God Ann Whitehead.

The Righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.

Printed in the Year, 1686

George Whitehead HIS Epistle and Account Concerning The Life and Death of Ann
Whitehead his dear Wife.
To be Communicated to Friends, especially those who knew her in Truth and
Faithfulness
MY dear and tender hearted Friends, who truly love the Name of the Lord, and
the precious and living Unity and Society of his holy Spirit, whereunto he has
called and gathered us by his invisible Power; you are truly dear unto me in
that life which shall never die, and in that love which is stronger then Death,
and therein my Soul truly loves all the Faithful in Christ Jesus, and such have
been and are my Joy and Crown of rejoicing in him, and such can sympathize one
with another, and bear one another Burdens in all Afflictions, Trials and
Sorrows which befall the Righteous in this short time of our Pilgrimage here on
Earth. And my dear and tenderly beloved Friends, though my Spirit be greatly
bowed down, and my Heart daily broken before the Lord under my present Exercise
and Affliction, in parting with so dear and true a Companion, and faithful
Servant of Christ and his Church, as my dear wife was well known to be; yet I
feel secret peace and acceptance with the Lord, in an humble submission to his
blessed Will, and in being reconciled to him in all his Ways and Dealings with
us, under all such Trials as he sees meet to bring upon us; as well knowing,
that precious to the Lord is the death of his Saints, and that the Lord who
gives, he takes away at his pleasure, and none can hinder him, nor may we say
to him What do thou? But wh^re Friends so nearly related have so long lived
together, in that sincere love, unity, concord and tender heartedness one to
another as we have done, it is a trial to part, it is a day of exercise and
heaviness, and requires some time to get through it, and it is the Lord alone
that can effectually relieve comfort and bind up the broken hearted in such
Cases and distressed Conditions. Yet we sorrow not as those that have no hope
of Immortality, or of meeting together in immortal Glory and Felicity
hereafter; for Life and Immortality is revealed and come to light in a good
measure, and therein have all the faithful Members of the Church of the first
Born some spiritual Sense and Union with the Spirits of all just Men and Women,
who have faithfully served the Lord in their Generation, and finished their
course with Joy; and the real sense of the Sincerity, Love and Zeal of my dear
Wife, for the Name of the Lord, lives and has deep impression upon my Heart,
and upon the Hearts of many more. She truly loved Truth and Righteousness, and
hated Wickedness and Deceit, Looseness and Pride: She was plain hearted and
true, and of a right Mind and sound Judgment, and near and dear to the Lord;
and therefore I always valued her in Truth, and esteemed her as one whom God
had effectually endued and qualified with Wisdom for her Service, which was
required of her: She truly and tenderly considered the Poor, the Widows and
Fatherless, and spared not her self to serve them that were in distress: She
was faithful and kept her integrity to the end, and the Lord has taken her to
himself, her Spirit is received into rest with God in Christ: She has obtained
that blessed end that Crowns all her Labors, Sufferings and Service. I cannot
forget her lively Testimonies and Expressions upon her dying Bed, nor be clear
without communicating something of the substance thereof unto you my dear and
tender Friends, who knew and truly loved her as she did you; my Soul has been,
and still is deeply affected in the sense and seeling of that tender Love and
Union that is among you, and was between you and her in her Life time, and with
your tender heartedness toward her, and in remembrance of her Life, and
Testimony, and Service for Truth she had among you; and therefore recommend
unto you some of her living Testimonies, Expressions and Desires to Almighty
God for his People, upon her dying Bed, and near her latter end, in testimony
of her real and tender love in Christ Jesus unto Friends, as follows, viz,

Upon some discourse which a Friend had with Ann Whitehead of the great service
which her Husband was in, and had done for suffering Friends, she answered, The
Lord has blessed and prospered my Husband in his Service, which is great
satisfaction to me, and this I shall leave behind me, as that which is
satisfaction to me* th^^ I never did detain him one quarter of an hour out of
the Lord's service, etc.

On the 23d 5th Month 1686, in the presence of several Friends, she declared,
as follows, viz.

I would not have you too much concerned about me, as to my going hence, I am
in the hand of the Lord, etc. (and with respect to Friends) I desire the God of
Peace and Love may be among all Friends, and that they may be kept in Love and
Peace, and Concord, unto which we were gathered in the Beginning, that the same
that gathered us in the beginning may always preserve Friends in the spirit of
Love, and of a sound Mind, [these words she expressed several times over] so as
the God of Peace and Love may continue with them, and be with them to the end;
and as for me, however the Lord shall please to dispose of me I am content in
his will.

And Friends Visits she several times acknowledged, as their great kindness and
love to her, though her weak Condition for some time could not bear much
Company at once. She further declared after this manner, viz. And as to my
Husband, I have signified my mind as to what I would have done, and leave it to
him to do as he sees meet, He Will do what s just and right. In our first coming
together I had an Eye to the Lord, that I might do nothing but what might be
accerding to his will, and that I might serve the Lord and his Church; and the
Lord has answered my desire: and he has been a tender and true Husband to me,
in all respects, etc. I have nothing desirable to me in this World save my
Husband, but I am content and given up in the will of God, however he shall
please to dispose of me, etc.

On the 24th 5th Month 86, being asked, how she was, she said, I am well, I
know nothing in this World, nor that to come, but all is well: Implying, that
all was well with her. A little after again expressing how well she was, and
given up in the will of the Lord; and signified her unity with all faithful
Friends, as being a living Member of the Body of Christ with them; and her
great love to all Friends in the Truth; and though she signified that a sadness
had come over her Spirit for two or three Weeks, insomuch that she was ready to
Weep (as she said) when any Friends looked upon her, or spoke to her, and that
she had been something troubled at it, as not knowing any thing by her self as
the reason thereof, but that she was naturally Pensive, (as she said) being
then clearly got over all that Sadness of Spirit, and over all her Affliction
and Pain, insomuch that the more near she drew toward her end, the more
cheerful she was, her Spirit being greatly revived and comforted in the great
love of God, and his tender mercies to her, whose mercies endure for ever to
them that fear him.

This faithful Servant of our Lord Jesus Christ was in such Patience, such
Contentedness, such Subjection of Spirit and holy resignation to the will of
the Lord, that she appeared no ways burdened with the thoughts of Death, nor
concerned, nor in the least troubled about it; Life immortal was over all. But
still she was given up in the will of God, desiring others not to be concerned
nor troubled about her, if the Lord pleased to take her away, saying, Let me go
away quietly.

Upon the 25th 5th Month 1686, when her ancient and faithful Friend Mary Stout
of Hartford came to visit her, toward evening, being asked, if she knew her,
she said, Yes, very well. it is Mary Stout, I have my Memory very well, and my
Understanding is clear, though I am very Weak, but I am given up into the will
of the Lord whether to Die or Live, for I have been faithful to him in what I
knew both in Life and Death. When she discerned any Friends troubled, she was
concerned, and would say, There Is no cause for you to be troubled, or
concerned, for I am well, and in peace, and have nothing to do, etc. with
several more words to the same purpose. Besides the many seasonable tender and
Christian Exhortations and Counsel which on her dying Bed she gave in the love
of God to particular Friends, (which I pray God may be truly remembered and
practiced) and her many weighty and apt expressions in discourse on several
occasions relating to Truth, etc.

On the 26th 5th Month 86. in the evening, Ann Whitehead said to her Husband,
etc. The Lord is with me, I bless his Name, and I am well. It may be you are
afraid I should be taken away, and if I be, the will of the Lord be done. Do
not trouble your selves, nor make any great ado about me. But my dear, go to
Bed, go to Rest; and if I should speak no more words to thee, thou know the
everlasting love of God, etc.

The next morning being the 27th 5th Month 1686, near three in the morning she
quietly departed this Life, at Briget Austil's, at Southstreet in Middlesex,
her Husband, Sister Ann-Mary Freeman, Ann Cox, Mary Stout and Briget Austil
being present at her departure.

And now dear Friends, the great tenderness, gravity and solemnity among our
tender and loving Friends accompanying her Body to the Burial on the 29th of
the 5th Month 1686, did very deeply affect my Heart; Friends love was felt
beyond utterance.

Thus having given you (my dear Friends) this naked account, I tenderly
recommend you all to the grace of God, to preserve you in the unity of his holy
Spirit, faithful to serve out your Generation in the love of God, and blessed
concord therein. I pray God keep you, comfort and supply you with all that is
needful for you to the end of your days; and in the end crown all your labors
of Love for his Names sake, with a Crown of Life and Glory that fades not away,
Amen.

Your assured Faithful Friend and Brother, G. Whitehead.
Written in the 5th and 6th Months, 1686.
Ann-Mary Freeman HER Testimony for her dear Sister Ann Whitehead.
AS to my dear Sister Ann Whitehead, who was greatly beloved in the Lord, by
all that knew her aright in the blessed Truth of God, for that she was always
given up, as a true and faithful Member of his Church, to serve him in constant
sincere Obedience, in her Generation and Day, on all accounts, as is well
known, whose practice and manner of Life and Conversation, being not only
Blameless, but of good Report and Savor amongst Men, from her Youth up; when I
was but a Child she took me unto her care, and tenderly educated, and helped me
many Years; and though young in Years then, yet this I can testify, that her
desires and inclinations were always religiously bent to serve the Lord, both
in Private and Public, in that way of Worship her Understanding reached to,
being so given up and devoted to his Service, that her Zeal for the same has
carried her through much hardship of Body, early and late; and in due time the
Lord answered the desires of her Soul, in visiting her with his Gospel Day, and
powerful Testimony of the glorious Light thereof; which she willingly embraced,
through the Lords goodness and love to her, and gave up to walk in the Light of
the Living, and was a Sufferer for bearing Testimony to the Truth, and found
great Peace and Satisfaction, and the Lords presence and blessings in her
Faithfulness and Perseverance, and indeed, as a natural Sister, I can say, and
that in true thankfulness to God, I have had great cause to bless the Lord in
her behalf, for she was a Treasure to me of great Value, and I can truly say I
honored her as my Mother, and she was not only a blessing to me, but also to
my Fathers House, and the Memorial of her is precious to me, and will be
blessed to Generations to come; and now as it has pleased the Lord to take her
hence, and I am deprived of so dear and near a Relation, I am, though in the
bowed-downness of my Spirit, before him subjected and reconciled to his will,
as knowing he gives and takes, and in his own time and pleasure, in whose
hand the breath of all is: So she is gone to Rest, and I am fully satisfied her
Soul is in Peace and Joy with the Lord eternally.

Much more might be said of her by me, but her daily Care and Service being so
well known by Rich and Poor, Old and Young, I shall forbear enlarging, knowing
her Reward is with her, and her Works follow her; for she did spend, and was
spent to serve the Lord faithfully in Truth and Righteousness to the end of her
days; and this I am a Witness of, though one of the meanest in Gods Vinyard,
who am by Name

Ann-Mary Freeman.

A Testimony for my dear and wel-beloved Friend Ann Whitehead, whom I dearly
loved in the Lord, and that for her Works sake, and for what the Lord had done
for her.
I Had a true knowledge of her in the blessed Truth, according to my measure;
she was a blessed Instrument in the hand of the Lord; about some twenty seven
Years ago, it was my lot to meet her at Kingston, at the House of John
Feilders, where we had a Meeting on the first day of the Week, and the Lord was
pleased to seize so upon me, by his everlasting power, through her Ministry,
that the operation thereof did so open my understanding, and confirm me in the
blessed Truth, that I could set to my seal that it was the true and the living
way, and the way wherein no Soul could ever be deceived; which day is never to
be forgotten with me, amongst the many other days of the Lords tender
Visitations to my poor Soul in the days of my Distress; and after I came more
acquainted with this my dear Friend, seeing her Faithfulness and Uprightness in
the Church of God, and her great care she had of the Servants of the Lord, it
did incline my Heart more and more unto her, blessed be the Name of the Lord,
who has quickened and made alive unto himself, and has made us near and dear
one unto another, and has knit and tied, and bundled up, and has united us
together in that one Spirit, which is the bond of our Peace, where there is no
Rent nor Division, but all one in Christ Jesus our Lord. And this is my
Testimony further to her Ministry, that it was living and true, and she was one
that never would go beyond the gift of the Spirit, but always would return into
that blessed Power that gave it forth, which was very precious to all that
heard her; and I can truly say that my Soul has been many a time truly
refreshed by her, and in her, and my Heart has been made right glad, for the
which I bless and praise the Name of the Lord forever, who is worthy says my
Soul. She was a true and faithful Woman to the Lord, and to his Truth, and had
a Testimony in her Heart against all things that would make a separation
therein; and I can truly say, it was very hard for me to part from her, because
of her worthiness, and the want of her in the Church and Family of God, and
especially in our blessed Woman's Meetings, where she was made very serviceable
beyond many others, through the gift the Lord had given her; but considering
the work is the Lords, and he is alsufficient to carry it on, to raise up other
Instruments in her place; the consideration thereof is a satisfaction to me,
and many more of my dear Friends and Sisters in the Truth, and now she is ceast
from her Labors and Sufferings, and is at rest with the Lord, who is her
reward for all; but tho she is gone, her Spirit lives in the Hearts of the
upright forever.

There is one remarkable thing brought to my mind, which was the last Testimony
of this our dear and wel-beloved Friend Ann Whitehead, at a Meeting at the Bull
and Mouth, a few Weeks before she departed this Life; first signifying' to
Friends how she came to the Meeting in much weakness, to be refreshed among us,
but withal declared, how she was burdened to see the vanity of the minds of
some professing the Truth; and so she went on Exhorting and Admonishing, and
Testifying against Pride and Vanity which she saw among some young People that
came among Friends.

So it is the desire of my Heart to the Lord that this her Testimony might not
be forgotten, but have a living impression upon the Spirits of all those whom
it concerns; and in that love which desires the good of all, I rest

Your Friend and Sister in the blessed Truth ihat sets free. Mary Elson.

Margaret Meekings HER TESTIMONY Concerning Ann Whitehead.
IF any, surely I have cause to bring in my Testimony for my dear Friend Ann
Whitehead, who was my ancient Acquaintance, both before and since she knew the
Truth, she being girded before by him she did not know, not to trust in earthly
Riches, but did then with prudence, and much tenderness do her duty, far
exceeding any I knew in that day, and since she has been convinced of the ever
blessed Truth, which through many trials and difficulties, and great exercises
she has passed through to walk therein, a very useful Instrument, in variety of
^^^vices, in the work of the Lord she has been, by his assisting power, who
endowed her with much Wisdom and sound Knowledge, to give Counsel and Advice to
the Simple, and much freeness to help the Helpless both with inward and outward
Comforts, and when in the outward she lived well of her own, in the beginning,
she then gave up all to suffer and serve the Truth; Oh her Value and many
Virtues, I want words to express what she was to me, and to many more that
truly knew her, so that her blessed footsteps I desire to walk in all my
appointed time, that as she did, I may lay down my Head in Peace, who I am well
satisfied is gathered into that bosom of Love where Joy and Felicity endures
for evermore.

Margaret Meekings.

A TESTIMONY Concerning Our ancient and dear Friend Ann Whitehead.
THE one Eternal God, besides whom there is none, has in these last days
manifested himself Emanuel, God with us, and in us, of a Truth, and all that
into the new Covenant are gathered and there abide have his Teachings, and feel
his Presence, and in the eating of the Bread that comes down from God discerns
the Body, whereof Christ Jesus is head, and know the Communion and everlasting
Union with God and all Saints; so when any are removed or fallen asleep, laying
down their earthly Tabernacles, our fellowship in Spirit ceases not, nor do we
sorrow as those without hope, but can with Joy remember, and make mention of
those that Lived and Dyed in the holy Faith, not speaking the praise of the
Dead, but of the Living, as this our dear Sister Ann Whitehead, who wrought in
God, and her Works follow her; I knew her entrance was at the straight Gate,
and had no sooner the sight of the Pearl of great Price, but was willing to
sell all for it, so put away that which was delightful to her, tho her own
Wotks, and highly priced by others, yet least there should be an Idol in them,
were thrown in the Fire by her; yea, all that she thought would stop her in her
Entrance, or hinder her walking in the narrow Way, yea her Relations, whom she
had manifested much kindness to, yet being contrary to Truth, she separated
from; and thus having cast off that which pressed down, she was not Idle, but
testified of the Truth in City and Country, as called of God, and she
manifested, that she was in the true Faith, for it worked by Love, I am a
Witness thereof, with many more. Before the Women's Meeting was settled she went
visiting the young convinced both Rich, and Poor, Counseling and Exhorting as
was needful, and supplying the Poor, and stirring up others thereto, and
watching with those that were Sick, and comforting the Parents with their dying
Children; yea helpful in many States, and had no Reward, nor looked for none,
but what she found in well-doing, and I was one that was a partaker of her free
Services, which was in and for the Truth-sake, daily stirring up others
thereto, that I then said in my Heart, she was worthy to be an Example to all,
but by me rather to be Admired then Imitated, for she was so Provident and
Endustrious, that tho she spent her time in doing good, yet did not waste what
she had, but did increase it every way, having not only an open Heart, but a
diligent Hand; but when she came to be a Wife, she was a blessing to her
Husband and his Children, as he told me himself, admiring her with many
Praises. And since the Woman's Meeting came to be settled, in which her Services
were very great, as in the Plague time, and after the Fire, necessities being
so great, and many, that there was much need of Wisdom and Parts to go through
what was required of us, her care, diligence and pains, and readiness in
Accounts, and disposing of it more then many, for her abillities therein
exceeded most, tho many were willing to work with her, but she only in those
things moved the great Wheel that caused the rest to follow, and she became a
Mother to teach and provide for many, and some have, and may confess and call
her Blessed, whose counsel and help raised some Families, and preserved others
from Ruin. O let her own Works praise her; but being in my Heart since her
Removal, in the Night and in the Day, I could not be clear without making some
mention in plainness of that sound Judgment and Wisdom, with Charity, that our
God had endued her withal, that as she followed our Lord Jesus Christ, we might
be followers of her; but neither I nor any can add unto her, but what is
brought to our remembrance of one so worthy to be an Example, that the minds of
some may be stirred up to like Wisdom, Endustry and Practice of those Virtues,
in which she did excel; for we have many Daughters among us that have done
worthily, but in many things she exceeded us all.

POSTCRIPT.
WHen I heard her Husband, and some others had given forth a Testimony of her,
I desired to have seen it, but did not see any until I had writ this of my own,
for I being sensible of my old Age and decayed Memory, with my Incapacity,
thought it would excuse me, if I said nothing, but as I put it from me, it
increased in my mind, the remembrance of her many worthy Works, and great
Sufferings for the precious Truths sake, that if called to it, I could have
writ a large Relation of her Actings and Sufferings for the Truths sake, since
I knew her, which is about twenty eight Years, but let this little suffice to
show my good will, etc.

A better name then that of Sons and Daughters God does give,
To them that in his Light do purely Live,
For they receive power to eschew all Evil,
And so reign over Sin, Death and Devil;
And she and all such, even of free Grace,
Sit down with Christ within the heavenly Place,
So they, and all that in our God do Trust,
And have no Idol, but adore the Just,
For its his Righteousness that makes pure,
And this is the Life that ever does endure,
And into this Ocean of Life and endless Love,
God gathers those that seek the things above.
R. T.



Mary Stout HER TESTIMONY FOR Ann Whitehead
AS concerning that true and faithful Servant of the Lord, our dear and
wel-beloved Friend and Sister in the Truth Ann Whitehead, there is little need
of much to be spoken in Character of her, she was so well known and read in the
Hearts of most of the Faithful now in Being: But that the Generations to come
may know what Worthies and Faithful Followers of the Lamb the Lord has blessed
this Age withal, who were as the first Fruits unto God in their Age, that
others also may tread in their steeps, and walk as they walked; therefore it is
meet that something should be spoken on this wise, and left upon Record, for
the memorial of the Just shall live forever.

I am very sensible that there are many dear Friends, especially in and about
London, in whose Hearts the Lord had given her an honorable place, and would
give her the right hand of Fellowship, whereupon every rememberance of her do
greatly lament their loss, and are ready to say in their Hearts, with me, Alas
our dear Sister, who shall supply thy place? but that we know him who is
all-sufficient, and will fit and prepare Instruments to carry on his own Work,
and is able also to pour forth a double portion of his good Spirit, (wherewith
she was richly endued) upon those who persevere in well-doing, and continue to
the end, as she did.

She was one of those that came forth early, even at the beginning and breaking
forth of that glorious day, in these our last times, which many of the
Righteous have longed to see, but have not seen it; and she received the Truth
in the love of it, and did bear her part of the Burden and heat of the Day, and
discharged her Place, and performed that service in the Body unto which she was
called with Faithfulness, and was a true Servant unto the Church of Christ, of
which she was a living Member, her Love and Care extended unto all, even from
the highest to the lowest and weakest Member thereof, and the daily concerns of
her Mind, and travel of her Spirit, and continual endeavors, were, that all
things might be so managed, and performed, that the Lord might be honored, and
his People so preserved, as that his Truth might prosper and be advanced
through and over all: Thus through her true practicing Religion and constant
diligence in the Work and Service of the Lord, she did arrive to such a state
in Christianity, and was grown into such a clearness and soundness of Judgment,
and was so impartial therein, that she answered the Witness of God, and gained
estimation and true value in the Hearts of the Righteous.

I shall not descend into particulars to speak what I know of her, although, if
I should, I could say much, having been anciently and intimately acquainted
with her, even above thirty Years, and knew the frame of her Spirit, and the
singleness and uprightness of her Heart to the Lord, to be such, that I must
needs give unto her Memory its due, and say, that although I do know many
Faithful and Worthy Women, who are dear and precious in the sight of the Lord,
and may truly be called Mothers in Israel, yet I know none that did exceed her.

When I look back, and call to mind the time of our first Convincement by the
Spirit of Truth, and the uniting of our Hearts thereby unto the Lord, and one
unto another, and how we, with many more dear Friends, have been preserved by
and in the living sense and feeling of the invisible power of the Lord, in
Unity with him, and one with another, even unto the day of her departure out of
this World, (when several who came forth with us are fallen by the way) I say,
the remembrance thereof is precious, and rejoices my Heart, even more then I
have words to express.

And now, as to what was spoken by her when she came to her Deathbed, I
question not but those dear Friends which were about her, and were longer
with her then I, have already given a more full and particular account then I
am able to do; only thus much I must say, that her patience and quietness of
Mind, and resignation of Spirit, together with those heavenly expressions of
that true Peace and full satisfaction, and assurance of the Love and Favor of
God at her Death, does abundantly evidence and confirm what is written of her
Life; for she did certainly die the Death of the Righteous, and her latter End
was like theirs, and the close of her Days, and finishing of her Course, does
demonstrate that she had keep the Faith, and that thenceforth there was laid up
for her a Crown of Righteousness.

Har^ord the 12th Day of the 8th Month 1686. Mary Stout.

Some Account OF Ann Whitehead's Early Experience, As written by her near
thirty Years Ago.
IN living Streams that Spring,
With Tears of Joy now can I Sing,
Of the Love and Peace that greets
When the upright hearted meets
In perfect Truth of living Power,
Which lasts ever down to shower,
The blessing of the lasting Hill,
Into the pure Heart to fill,
With the fullness of his Grace,
Which beholds with open Face
The glory of the holy Spirit,
Which changes man that life to inherit;
Now being come unto the Life,
The Tree into the Waters of strife,
That fell to sweeten them
From their bitter sower Leven,
By its own Fruit is known,
True Joy and Peace from Heaven flown,
Here he may take and freely Eat,
For whom God does prepare his Meat,
Even his own Seed of Israel's Flock,
Whose Offspring is the faithful Flock,
Which to his Voice alone gives ear,
Whereby the Heart is kept so clear,
A place only for the pure fear;
The awe and dread of perfect sight
Which shines in eternal Light,
There the Lambs Kingdom is known,
WhereChrist the Lord has only Throne,
Ruling in Life and Spirit meek,
Subjecting all under his Feet,
The Earth and Air, and all dark Power,
Which may arise to tempt an houer,
And try if in the upright Heart
It can find out any part,
There to get in
By Death or Sin,
The Lamb to Wouud and Slay,
On whom the Beast would make his Prey;
But waiting have the Patience tried,
The Faith that saves is soon espied,
Which safely keeps the little Flock,
That drinks of the heavenly Rock,
From which the Water freely springs,
That gives Life to all good things;
And here indeed,
There is no need,
Because of right,
All that abide i'th'Light,
May take and eat
There daily Meat,
And praises gives
To him that Lives
For evermore to Reign,
Where there is no Death nor Pain,
Glory, glory to the Highest,
Who brings to Peace and perfect Rest,
These Verses, of dear Ann's own Writing, she gave me at her return from the
Isle of Wight, where she ^ad been traveling in the Service of Truth above
twenty eight Years since, when she had been absent for some space of time.

Grace Bathurst HER TESTIMONY Concerning Ann Whitehead.
SInce it has pleased the Lord, who is only Wise, by his divine Providence, to
remove from us his faithful Servant Ann Whitehead, my Spirit has been in
Heaviness, and Sorrow has filled my Heart many a time, upon the consideration
of the great loss that I with many more shall have of her, as particulars, unto
whom she has been as a Mother in tender Advice and Counsel, and also the
Church in general, whose Service she never declined, but in readiness of mind
she gave up her self to serve the Lord and his People in uprightness, as I can
bear my Testimony in Righteousness for her, having been Conversant with her
ever since I knew the way of the Lord, as it is now revealed, in and through
the Light and Spirit of Christ Jesus in the Heart, which discovers the works of
Darkness, and all secret Iniquity; I say, ever since it pleased the Lord in the
freeness of his Love and tender Mercy to make known his Truth unto me, it has
been my privilege to be acquainted with this faithful Servant of the Lord, and
I have been exercised with her in many Services relating to the Poor, where I
have seen her great Care, Love and Charity extend to many poor helpless
Families, as also her Wisdom and Justice in making a difference betwixt the
Worthy and the Unworthy, and the honest hearted amongst them blessed the Lord
for her; and as there was a care in her to supply their outward wants, she was
always furnished with a word of Exhortation, according as their States
required, that they should have their dependency upon the Lord; so that from my
own knowledge, her Exercises were many, and her Travels great for the prosperity
of Truth; and I pray God that we who knew her, and are left behind, may follow
her steps, as she followed Christ to the end of her days; and some of her last
Words that she spoke to me, being near her end, was, That she was satisfied
with the will of the Lord, and did not desire any thing to be otherways then it
was as to her, for she felt a Reward from the Lord; being filled with Joy, she
prayed fervenrly for Friends Children, That the Lord would bless them, and that
they might fear the Lord, and grow and walk in the Truth, and be preserved from
the Spirit of Pride; which was the Substance of her last public Testimony, as
many may remember. Much more I could say, but this being only to ease my Spirit
and discharge my duty to her whom I loved in the Truth.

Mary VVoolley HER TSETIMONY Concerning Ann Whitehead.
ALthough I am satisfied there will be Testimonies many, by them more worthy
then my self, concerning our dearly beloved Friend Ann Whitehead, yet can I not
peaceably pacify my own Heart and Spirit without giving in my Mite amongst the
rest of my dear Friends and Sisters, whom I know have not buried her Works with
her Body; my Testimony is, They shall stand upon Record to after Ages, for I
know her savoury Life has been a help to season many Sons and Daughters, and
though it has pleased the Lord to gather her into everlasting Rest and Peace,
and by Flesh to be seen no more, yet does her Righteous Spirit, Life and
Testimony live freshly amongst us, blessed be the Lord therefore: Oh, our dear
Ann cannot be forgotten by us, who knew her, as she was a faithful Handmaid and
Daughter of the Lord, and by us truly Valued; for the Lord was pleased to
clothe her, with the Kings Daughter, all Glorious within; her righteous Heart
loved no false Coverings, but still was laboring to keep Truth clear over all
Deceit, always encouraging all, both Privately and Publicly, to serve the
Truth in their day with singleness of Heart, and uprightness of Mind, and
wherever she found the Lord was dishonored by any, and his Truth evil spoken
of, she spared not her self, but with, and in his Wisdom she dealt with such,
to bring them to a sight of their evil doing; the Lord had surely a great
regard unto her for her sincerity of Heart in his Service, for I am one with
many of the Lords People, that can testify of her unwearied pains and care in
the Church of Christ, like as Priscilla and Aquilla, whom Paul calls fellow
helpers in the Gospel, so I know could many of the Lords Servants and Worthies
call her in her day; for the Lord was pleased to give large Gifts unto her;
because her Heart was right in his sight, and her delight was to improve her
Talent in her Lords Service, laying aside all things else for the sake of that;
a true Mother in Israel indeed, taking always due care for them that were in
want of help, inwardly or outwardly; to the simple and honest hearted she was
truly tender, and was as Eyes to the Blind, and Legs to the Lame, teaching
them, in the way of Life, to the strait path where she had walked and traveled
without fainting by the way: I would not leave off without giving her her due
in more things then these I have hinted, but not being willing to be too large,
knowing that many were the Friends that loved her in her Life, and served
according to their measure in the ever blessed Truth with her, that would have
the same privilidge, in easing of their tender Hearts and broken Spirits as I
have; her dear and worthy Husbands loss is great indeed, in his own particular,
but that I know his will is resigned to the will of the Lord; I saw something
of their pure Innocent parting, upon her dying Pillow, which I believe I shall
not hastily forget; as she Lived she Died, an honorable esteem she had of him
in her Life, so had she to the Last, with great desires that nothing upon her
account might hinder his Service; of us that were about her, she took a dear
and tender Farewell, with a kind acceptance of our Care and Love to her, which
was but our reasonable Service and Duty; for in her day the Lord gave her
amongst us, and she was a blessed Instrument; and the Lord be good unto us, and
keep us in his holy fear, that we may run the Race that he has set before us,
and finish our Course with Joy, as I am satisfied she has done; Amen, Lord
Jesus Amen.

From a Lover of the Truth, and the Servants of it. Mary Woolley.

Bridget Ford HER TESTIMONY Concerning Ann Whitehead.
FInding my self not clear without casting in my Mite, by way of Testimony, for
my dear esteemed and honored Friend in the blessed Truth Ann Whitehead, whom
the Lord endued with Wisdom, and made her a Mother in Israel; and I can say, I
have seen her take the Weak by the hand, and lead them on in the work of the
Lord, and she has been comforted and refreshed when she felt any whom the Lord
had made willing to put their hand to his Plow, and their shoulder to his Work;
she has rejoiced in Spirit and praised the Lord on their account, and like a
nursing Mother did tender and cherish the Good and reprove the contrary; she
often visited the Widow and Fatherless, and had compassion toward them,
sturring up other holy Women thereunto, as also to clothe the Naked, feed the
Hungry, and visit those that were in Prison; what shall I say? it was her
delight to serve the Lord and his People, she was a faithful Labourer in the
Vinyard of our God, and I am fully satisfied she has finished that Work the
Lord sent her to do, with Joy, and now it has pleased him to gather her to
himself, where she rests from her Labors, and her Works follow her, and is
crowned with a Crown of Glory; everlasting Praises, Honor and Dominion be
given to our God, henceforth and for evermore, Amen.

London, the 24th of the 7th Month, 1686. Bridget Ford

Charles Bathurst HIS TESTIMONY FOR Ann Whitehead.
AS for our dear Friend A. W. I have this short Testimony to bear concerning
her. She was a Person whom the Lord had endued with singular Wisdom, and I have
some time hard her say, She sought the Lord from her Youth, and followed the
best of Men, and best of Means, according to the dispensation of those times.

But when the Lord was pleased to visit this Nation with the manifestation of
his glorious Truth, she was called in the Morning of that Day, and followed the
Lord fully through many Sufferings and various Exercises, and still grew in the
Truth; so that she arrived to a high pitch of divine Knowledge, whereby we may
truly say, Deborah like, She became a Mother in Israel: Her Agency and
Usefulness in the Church cannot be better demonstrated then by the many Tears
that followed her to the Grave; and as she was filled with heavenly Wisdom, so
she increased in humane also, and did not hide her Talent in a Napkin, but
spent her self in the Service of the Truth, and was ready to communicate to any
that stood in need of her grave Counsel, and of this I know there are many
Witnesses; I can for my own part say, I have often had occasion to resort to
her, and to receive Advice from her, in many matters of important weight, and
always found her Advice very successful; and as she was thus serviceable to the
Church in General, and to many Members in Particular, so she was very helpful
to the Poo^, and a frequent visiter of distressed Families; I know not indeed
wherein she was defective, except (it were) to her self, in spending her
strength in continual service for the Truth, till Nature hastened to its Center:
But I shall not further enlarge, being filled with sorrow for the loss of so
worthy a Friend, but wish, that we that remain behind (may in our measure)
follovv her Footsteps, in her worthy Actions, knovving that now she has
received a Revvard of all her Labors, and is at rest with the Lord forever,
to whom be returned praises by a Member of his Church and People.

The 1st. of the 6th, Month, 1686. Charles Bathurst.

Bridget Austill HER TESTIMONY Concerning Ann Whitehead.
A Short Testimony lives in my Heart, and is weighty upon my Spirit concerning
our dear and worthy Friend, and dearly beloved of the Lord Ann Whitehead, of
whose savory Life and sweet innocent Conversation I was a Witness for a
considerable term of Years, in all which time, since the Lord in his
everlasting Mercy brought me into acquaintance with himself, and true nearness
with his People, I beheld her Beauty and Comeliness in the Truth, and her
inward Adorning, which was a meek and quiet Spirit, seasoned with Graces, and
Virtue, and true Wisdom from above, which the Lord had largly endued her
withal, whereby she was always furnished with a Word in season upon all
Occasions, a true Mother in Israel indeed, still making it her greatest concern
in her place, that all might be kept in right order in the Church of Christ,
and nothing vvanting, tenderly admonishing the young Ones to press forvvard in
the way of Life and Peace, which might make for their everlasting happiness
hereafter, and gently advising and exhorting the elder Women to walk as good
examples, in all Comeliness in their places, that the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ might be adorned by them: These things have I many a time been an Ear
Witness to, and my Soul refreshed thereby, and though but one of the least of
the Lords Servants that may give in their Testimonies, yet I could not with
satisfaction pass by without setting Pen to Paper on this wise, having ever
since the Lord made me sensible of her Worth, had an honorable esteem of her
in my Heart, and my Soul loved her with faithful Love, and as she lived the
Life of Truth, so she finished her Course with Joy I am satisfied, as being an
Ear Witness of the many sweet and heavenly Expressions that passed from her
often times on her Bed of Weakness, which I believe will remain weighty upon my
Spirit; oh her free resignedness up to the will of the Lord, with true
contentedness in her Condition, often saying, She had done with all things in
this Life, that she had nothing troubled her, but was at true Peace and Ease
every way; desiring us that were about her (whose Love and tender Bowels
toward her she sensibly felt) that we would not be troubled, but give her up
freely, saying to me, but a few houers before she departed, That though she was
in a dying Condition, yet it was a living Death, and that Weakness had seasoned
her outward Man, but her Understanding and Sense was as perfect and clear as
when she was in her perfect Health, and that she was in true Love and Charity
with all: Oh, great is the loss of her in the Church of Christ, she whom the
Lord had so furnished and fitted for his Service, which she faithfully
performed to the last; I pray God grant that we which are left behind may
according to our measures follow her righteous Example, and walk in
faithfulness with God as she did in her day; my Heart is full at this very
Moment, and my Spirit broken before the Lord in the remembrance of our dearly
beloved Friend, my House being the place where she laid down her Head in Peace
with the Lord; and although her Body be returned to its Center, yet her Spirit
and Life is truly felt and witnessed in eternal union amongst us. So having
eased' my Spirit thus far in this concern, I conclude, who am known by Name

Bridget Austill.

Ruth Crouch HER TSETIMONY FOR Ann Whitehead
COncerning my dear and entirely beloved Friend Ann Whitehead, whom it has
pleased God to remove out of this transitory and fading World, and from the
Troubles and Exercises which attend it, and the Lord having yet continued me
amongst the Livingand capable to say or write something in Commemoration of
her, I account my self engaged to perform it; for as I had a delight to
converse with her, and took pleasure to be in her Company when she Lived, so
her Memory is sweet, and the savor of her Life remains in the frequent
renewings thereof upon my Spirit, and the same shall continue amongst the
Faithful through Ages; she was not to me a Stranger, for besides our unity and
oneness in Spirit, I knew her personally from my Childhood, and many precious
Oppertunities God afforded us, both Public and Private, so that I had a full
knowledge of her these thirty two Years, as my Capacity could retain, and can
therefore with a good Conscience testify on her behalf, that she was one whom
God had, in an extraordinary manner, visited with the springings of his
everlasting Day, and furnished her with Wisdom and Gifts beyond many others;
she had a gift of Discerning, and so quick and ready in Comprehension,
accompanied with soundness of Judgment, which she managed with a Wisdom and
Gravity, even to admiration, all which rendered her honorable in the Church of
Christ, where her Service was very great, and unto which she gave her self up
to the utmost, of which Service and Labor, many, upon whom it is since sallen,
may I believe testify for her, and I in particular am a Witness on her behalf;
she wanted not, but was largly extensive in her Charity for the Poor, she was
always ready to contribute to the Necessitous, she was furnished with Counsel
from God to many in Distress both inward and outward, which she readily gave,
the same being often accompanied with a good Effect, for she opened her Mouth
with Wisdom, and in her Tongue was the Law of Kindness; and in Meetings, although
she had excellency of Matter, and also of Delivery, by saying much in a few
Words, for she used not many, neither was she forward or hasty to Speak, for I
believe it was her care not to prevent or hinder the Brethren in their
Testimony for God and his Truth, and when any such thing happened it greatly
grieved her, for she loved good order in the Church, and made it her business
to promote and advance it, and was her self so subjected by a heavenly Wisdom,
which instructed her in the right seasons to speak, or to withold, even as
the same might be of Service in the Church; so that may it not be said, Many
Daughters have done Virtuously but she excelled us all: Her constant and long
continued care for the Church and Poor, of late (through providence) seemed
harder and more difficult to her then formerly it had done, which caused her to
desire that some other Women would take upon them some part of that which she
had long traveled under, with some desire to withdraw a little by reason of
some Weakuess she found attending her outward Man, and accordingly she went
into the Country, to Southgate, where her Weakness increasing she did in a few
Weeks finish her Course, and thither I went to visit her, and was sometimes
with her in her Sickness, and am sensible that the Lord was with her in a
wonderful manner, and furnished her with Patience and Content in her Condition,
with a Resignation and holy Submission to his Will, in which frame she
continued unto the end.

And now that the Lord, who is the God of the Spirits of all Flesh, would be
pleased in Mercy to increase amongst us the number of such Laborers in his
Harvest, which is the desire of my Heart, and Prayer to God; and that he who
did in loving kindness visit me early, even in the Morning of this his blessed
Day, and has preserved me until now, grant an increase daily of his Wisdom and
Counsel unto me, that I may serve him and his People in my Generation, and may
follow the steps of this my dearly beloved Friend, who is gone before, and
through Faith obtained a good Report, and her Works praise her in the Gate.

To God Almighty be Glory and Honor over all, for ever and ever, Amen.

Ruth Crouch.

John Staplo HIS TESTIMONY Concerning Ann Whitehead.
THE Remembrance of dear A. W. cannot be forgotten, she was my endeared Friend
and whom I loved right well for the Truth's sake, in the enjoyment of whose
Company I have been many a time Refreshed and Comforted, through the savor of
Life in her Communication; she was endued with the Virtues of Truth, and
seasoned with the Spirit thereof, which rendered her Converse very acceptable;
great is the want of so dear a Friend, the Lord be pleased to raise up more
such spirited Women, like minded, to serve Truth in their Generation; in the
early of her day she began to Fear, Love and Serve the Lord, and her
Perseverance is known to many, my knowledge of her was about twenty six Years,
and she was affectionately tender to me in the time of my first Convincement,
when I was a Stranger to most Friends she wanted not in that day to give good
Counsel, and godly Admonishion; and I have this satisfaction in my self, I was
glad when I had an oppertunity to serve her, and my Spirit has been tendered
in the consideration of what she has been to the Lord, and done for the
service of his Truth and People: I well remember, and believe shall not forget
while I retain my Love to Truth, what she said to me when I first visited her
(with another Friend) as I did often in the time of her Weakness, which she
resented kindly, being about* six Miles from London, and said, What do you come
on purpose to see me, I take it as an effect of the Love of God, and I pray God
Bless thy Children: Which render and motherly Expressions came very near, and
affected my Spirit, and there was an earning desire in me, Oh that the Lord
would please to spare thee, how glad should I be; 'twas more to me what she
said at that time, then if I had had given me a great deal of this World, for
that the Blessing of the Lord was, and is of value in my Eye above all outward
Concerns. Another time, when I went to see her, which was her last day save one
in this World, her dear Sister, Ann-Mary Freeman, being present; Remember me
(said she) to all Friends, and I pray God Bless your Families, and if I never
see thy Face more, it is well with me, God does know my Integrity, and how I
have been, and walked before him, and I am in Charity with all Friends, and be
not over Careful or Troubled for me, but be Retired and Quiet: My Heart was
Comforted to hear her gracious Words, yet Sorrow attended at the thoughts of
being deprived of so Dear and Ancient a Friend, Diligent and Faithful Servant
of the Lord, one that loved the Peace of the Church; and as there is a Record
of David's mighty Men, in another Case, so may she be Remembered among the
first of the honorable Women, for such were her seize; indeed I want
Words to express what I have at times felt (of her Worthiness) in my Spirit.
One thing I have in memory of her, she always stood clear of taking any part
with those that ever rose in opposition to the Truth, and the Servants of it,
and had a Testimony against that Spirit in all kinds, that has appeared to
make Divisions amongst the Lord*s People. Well she is gone to her Rest, and we
that are left behind a little time to sojourn here, it remains for us to be
mindful of our latter Day, and season of Change, for that it may be perceived
Mortality comes on a pace on this Generation; some are concerned in the
consideration of how many dear and honest Friends are lately taken from us, we
had need be girt up in Mind, and diligent in Spirit, that we fall not short of
doing the Work of our Day, and while we have Time, all to prize it.

John Staplo.

William Ingram HIS TESTIMONY FOR Ann Whitehead.
AS concerning our dear Friend Ann Whitehead, she received Truth at the first
breaking forth of it among us, and was blessed of God, who endued her with many
spiritual Gifts and Graces, whereby she became a Blessing to others, and the
sweetness of that Life which flowed through her Earthen Vessel has often
Comforted and Refreshed God's People, who in the sense of that living Power,
which plentifully appeared in her, have many times been broke into tenderness
before the Lord, and in their Hearts have returned Praise unto him on her
behalf, who was known to be Faithful and Sincere, a true Preacher of
Righteonsness in her Day; and although she outwardly be taken from us, and her
Body removed to its place, yet her Spirit Lives, and the memory of her
Faithfulness, Exercise and Sufferings for Truth's sake, and Labor for the
Prosperity thereof, continues amongst us, has a deep impression on the Spirits
of many, and will remain in the Churches of Christ, where her Service was
manifest, as a matter of great Value and Esteem not to be forgotten; for indeed
she was a Mcther in Israel, a Nursing Mother to many Children, begotten by the
same word of Faith, which richly dwelled in her, whereby she was
strengthened with Might in the inward Man, so that she was strong in the
Lord, and though many Archers shot at her; to Grieve and Wound her Life, yet
her Bow always abode in Strength, and she was covered by the heaveuly Power of
God, out of the Enemies reach, as one of the Lords hidden ones, in favor with
him; and I am assured in my Spirit he has preserved her unto his everlasting
Kingdom of Rest and Peace, who was a sanctified Vessel unto him, fit for his
use, and to bear his Name forth unto the World, and an eminent Example of
Righteousness unto all, who by her chaste Conversation, coupled with Fear and
diligent perseverance in the Truth, did adorn the Gospel of our Lord, being as
a true Daughter of Abraham, adorned with those inward Ornaments of the hidden
man of the Heart, as were the holy Women of old who trusted in God; and she has
now finished her Course, fought the good Fight of Faith, and I am satisfied
has obtained a Crown of Righteousness, as a reward of her Travels and Labors,
which is prepared, not only for her, but for all that love the appearance of
the Lord Jesus Christ, a more full Enjoyment of whom she had long been waiting
in a preparation for, and as sensible of her Dissolution, or of her Departure
being at hand, did often Exhort and Admonish Friends to concern themselves with
that part of the Care which fell on her for the Church, and to diligence in the
Lords Work and Business, which she her self was mightily furnished to the
performance of, through the Wisdom given her of God, and in the consideration
of our great loss, I have secretly desired of the Lord, that he would please to
pour out of his Spirit on some worthy Instruments to succeed her in his Work
and Service.

This Testimony is part of what rested on my Spirit on behalf of our dear
Friend Deceased, who I greatly valued in the Truth, having often felt the
distillings and dropping down of heavenly Dew, and refreshment from her Branch,
which springing from the living Vine, brought forth Fruits Savoury and
Acceptable, which my Soul did often delight in, and the savor of that virtuous
life, which flowed through her Spirit, still is Consolation unto me, and the
remembrance of it, I know, will yet be precious to all who are rightly sensible
thereof.

William Ingram.

Mary Forster HER TESTIMONY Cencerning Ann Whitehead.
AH, my Sister, my worthy Friend Ann Whitehead, who was highly favored of the
Lord, and endued with an excellent Spirit, to follow the Lord fully, and to be
serviceable to him, his Truth and People; for the Lord did not only enlarge her
Heart, but fill it full of his divine Virtue, and as a Scribe instructed in the
Kingdom, she did bring forth of the Treasure which God had given her, things
both New and Old; she fought the Lord in her Youth, and betimes tasted, and was
made partaker of his heavenly Grace, so that her Experience was great, and the
fresh living Springs of Life did often run through her, to the refreshment of
many; and in the spirit of true discerning she did divide the Word of God
aright, to the Poor, Penitent and Brokenhearted, Peace, Mercy and Forgiveness;
but to the Stubborn, Idle and Disobedient, Righteous Judgment; and indeed such
could not stand before her, yet could she bear the Burdens of the Weak, and
Suffer with the Afflicted Ones; I have for about twenty seven Years known her,
her ability and readiness to serve the Lord in his Church, and more especially
in the affairs of the Poor, which she did in much Wisdom and Prudence, not
sparing her Person or Substance, when either could be serviceable; indeed it
was her Meat and Drink to do the Will and Work of God; she was a cheerful
Sufferrer for the Name and Truth of our Lord Jesus Christ, and did encourage
others so to do, and to hold out to the end. What can I say! her Worth is
sufficiently known to the Children of the Day (especially those amongst us) and
blessed be our God, although her Person be removed from us, yet that Spirit
which made her amiable to us, in all her Services, is not departed, but remains
with us, and has its operation in many Sons and Daughters; but she is gone,
and we shall see her no more here; and it has often run through me (whose
Faith follow) she had an inward Life and Conversation in Heaven, and whilst
here on Earth was clothed upon with Life and Immortality, and was entered into
the Rest of God; and having run the Race, having fonght the good Fight, having
kept the Faith, she had the Crown of Life, and is now Crowned with Glory in
that Mansion which Christ our Lord has prepared for her, and not for her only,
but for all them who love his appearance, and in their day diligently wait for
his coming to finish Transgression, and to make an end of Sin, and to bring in
everlasting Righteousness, so come Lord Jesus,

The 10th of the 8th Month, 1686. Mary Forster.

A TESTIMONY concerning Ann Whitehead.
AS the Lord alone is the Author of every good thing that a People or Person
does enjoy, which causes them to differ in any excellent Virtue, so he is to
have the Praise and Honor over all; yet in a living sense, which I feel upon
my Spi-rit, there is a Testimony remains with me for my dear Friend and Sister
in the blessed Truth Ann Whitehead, who was an honorable Woman in her Day, and
very serviceable in the Churches in and about London, and in other parts of the
World, where her hand of Love and motherly Instructions did reach, yea to the
Isles afar off; oh, what shall I say, or write, concerning my dear Friend,
whose Body is laid in the Grave, but her worthy Acts yet lives in the memory
of the Faithful, and time would fail to make mention of the many particulars in
which her service was very weighty, but this, I may say of her, that she was a
faithful Steward of the manifold Gifts and Graces which she received from the
hand of the Lord, and that in a plentiful manner; and she did not hide her
Talents, but improved them daily for the benefit of the Churches of Christ,
being always ready and fitted for every good Word and Work, and the fervency of
her Spirit to serve the Lord and his People did often carry her above the
weakness of her Body, who did attain to a good age, and now is gone to her rest
in God, like a shock of Corn in its season and though I with many more are
often bowed in our Spirits, in the sense of the great want of her, yet I am
satisfied her gain is great, and she is entered into everlasting Joy and Peace
with the Lord God and the Lamb forever and evermore; and it is the desire of my
Soul and Spi-rit to the Lord, that I with all the Handmaids of the Lord, in and
about this City, and every where, may so attend upon the Lord in our several
Places and Services, which we are or may be called to, that we may receive more
and more of his Wisdom and Counsel, that according to the ability that God
gives unto us, we may in some measure supply the place of our dear Friend, who
is gone before us, that the great and wise God may be honored by us and through
us, who is worthy of all Praise and living Obedience from me, and all that know
him in Truth, both at this time and for evermore; Amen.

Ann Travers HER TESTIMONY Concerning Ann Whitehead.
I Having been well acquainted with our dear and wel-beloved Friend and Sister
Ann Whitehead, could do no less then bring in my Testimony with the rest of my
Sisters in the blessed Truth of God, I having known her above thirty Years; at
my first Convincement she gave up her self to serve the Church of Christ, and
abode faithful to the Truth, and was endued with heavenly Gifts, and was able
to lend a hand to the Weak, for the Lord had endued her with a large measure of
spiritual Wisdom, and in outward things also she was capable, and also willing
to help any in Distress, as for the Sick her care was for them, and for the
Fatherless and the Widow, she was as a Mother in care for them, and the loss of
her (in the Church of Christ) is very great, and the Memorial of her will not
be forgotten, for her Works praise her, and will be had in everlasting
rememberance with the Lord.

The 14th Day of the 8th Month, 1686. Ann Travers.

A short Testimony to the good Life of a worthy Matron in Israel, Ann Whitehead.
I Knew her six and twenty Years ago, after the breaking forth of that blessed
day of God upon us, and she was made an early partaker of the day Star that
arose in us, even in the Hearts of Thousands, both Sons and Daughters, of which
this my dear Sister Ann Whitehead was one of the chosen Vessels, and by her
Integrity and Faithfulness was fitted and prepared to and for her heavenly
Masters Use and Service, and so by receiving her pure divine Sap and Virtue
from the blessed divine Root, she grew up to be an honorable Vessel, thoroughly
furnished unto every good Work she was called unto, yea a living Member of the
true Body and Church of Christ, yea a living Branch of the true Vine, my Soul
can bear her witness, with many more who partaked of her Virtue, and saw her
motherly Care in the Church, and for the good of all, and so can do no less in
Truth and Righteousness, then let her Name be had in living Remembrance, and
though her bodily presence be removed from us, yet her living Works praise her
in the Gate; for with Wisdom, Prudence and godly Sincerity she was richly
adorned, hating even the Garment spotted by the Flesh, and very severe she was
against any that had defiled their Garments, for her Garment was made White in
the Blood of the Lamb, and she was like one of those who had not defiled their
Garments, And they shall walk with me in White, for they are Worthy, says he
that is Holy and True; and now, what shall I say, my Heart is deeply affected
to think of our great loss, for a true Mother in Israel is gone, and taken away
to inherit and possess that Crown Immortal laid up for her, who loved his
appearance, and was a faithful follower of the Lamb in the Regeneration, and is
now fat down in the Kingdom of Glory with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and so we
cannot Mourn as those without Hope, but in the will of my heavenly Father to
learn subjection by all my Trials and Exercises; and the desire of my Soul is,
that we that are left behind may be faithful Followers of the footsteps of this
our dear Sister, with her dear and honorable Companion, whose Paths, their just
Paths have been, and are as a clear and bright shining Light shining forth more
and more to the consolating and refreshing of my Soul, with very many more; and
so that Spirit in her, unto which I was united, shall never dye, and in this we
feel her amongst us, and are content in the will of the Lord.

Lucretia Cook.

This Testimony lives in my Heart for my wel-beloved and rightly esteemed
Friend Ann Whitehead.
SHE was one that did truly fear God, by which she had learned a great degree
of true Wisdom, and through the inspiration of Gods holy Spirit had attained to
a good and sound Understanding, both of Spiritual and Natural things, through
which she was made a Vessel of Honor, being one whom the Lord had fitly
furnished to be of great use, and truly serviceable to and amongst the Household
of Faith, through the virtue of that Life which the Lord often communicated
through her, to and amongst them, insomuch that their inward and outward Life
was often Refreshed, Comforted and Strengthened; yea I can say, and am obliged
to acknowledge, that the Lord made her Instrumental to (...) both, for which I
bless the Lord on her behalf, and that he has made known and preserved me in
the sense of that Righteous Principle which her Christian Practice did often
reach to, and answer, as Face answers Face in a Glass; and this is that
indeed by which I know many with me can in their Spirits seal to, who were and
are sharers of the Virtue of that indwelling Life which her Spirit was gathered
into; and blessed be the Lord, does my Soul say, in the lively sense of her Joy
and endless Felicity, who did receive an hundred fold in this Life as an
earnest of that Incorruptible Immortal Life, and is now entered into the full
possession of it, being an Heir of that Promise, Blessed are the Dead that Dye
in the Lord; she is ceased from her Labor, and her Works follow her.

And now alas! what shall I say,
An Isralite is gone this day,
Who true and faithful was to God,
Against all Wickedness a Rod,
A tender Mother, yet indeed
Well furnished to help our need,
Well then bewail our loss may we,
So faithful, true and wise was she,
For often did she recommend
Us to the Lord, our lasting Friend,
Our loss indeed how shall we take,
What but her gain can it up make,
For sure, revived this may be,
One said to dye is gain to me,
Which gain transcends! me thinks I find
Her reward great; that is in my mind,
In Gospel work she had a share,
Great was her Labor and her Care
To bring more Children to that place,
Where Godworks in them by his Grace,
This I observed that still she aimed,
The Truth of God might not be blamed,
Which faithful Labor I did find,
Was from a just and righteous mind.
And now I pray, O Lord, keep me,
Even all my days, faithful to thee,
That so an Isralite indeed,
I may be found of Isaacs Seed,
Of which right Seed was this my Friend,
I testify, and so shall end.
Abigail Fisher.

A TESTIMONY concerning Ann Whitehead.
DEar Ann is gone! her Glass is Run,
She Is entered into Rest,
She lived here in Gods pure Fear,
Died in him, and is Blessed.
She served the Lord in Faithfulness,
And when her end drew nigh
Told me her Work was finished,
She Would naught to do but Dye.
She did desire her Love to Friends
Remembered it might be,
In that which universal is,
The Truth (which makes free.)
Great was her Zeal, great was her Cars,
And Labor in her Day,
To serve and helpful be, to those
Were turned into Gods Way.
She was a Vessel fitted and
Prepared by the Lord
To honor him, and loved all those
Who served him with accord.
Oneness of Heart, oneness of Mind,
Amongst Gods Children dear,
She valued high, Exhorting all
To dwell in Gods pure Fear.
With Wisdom and Discerning great
The Lord did her endue,
Quickness of Sight and Sense she had
With Judgment Sound and True.
To me she was a trusty Friend
And good advice did give,
Her Memory to me is Sweet
In that where she did Live.
And certainly our loss is great
May many Children say,
A Mother that in Israel was
Is from us t'ane away.
But yet the Lord the Living God
Her Husband, will remain
To us a Father dear, and will
His Childrens Cause maintain.
Against those that do his Work oppose,
In Males or Females: All
Are one in Christ, and those oppose
His Work, shall surely fall.
God will raise up and furnish more
For to supply her Place,
Vessels of honor sanctified
And seasoned by his Grace.
To carry on that blessed Work
Of Righteousness, which He
Will cause to spread and prosper still,
To all Eternity.
Benjamin Antrobus.

A Short TESTIMONY Concerning our dear Friend Ann Whitehead.
A Dear and Precious, Holy and Upright Woman was she in her day, loved Truth
and Righteousness, and hated all Iniquity, she was a Mother in Israel indeed; O
how did she make it her great Care and Business to serve the Lord, his Truth
and his People, the Widow, Fatherless and Stranger; she was a good Steward in
the House of the Lord, her care was that none should suffer Want, that all
things might be keep Sweet and Clean, and in good Order; she was a Valiant
Woman in her day, my Soul loved, her, my Life was knit unto her; how did she
travel before the Flock in great Wisdom and Power of the Almighty: O when I
consider the many blessed, sweet and heavenly opertunities that we have had
together with her, in our retired waitings upon the Lord, I am ready to mourn
apart for her, methinks I feel a miss of her more and more: O how did she wait
at Wisdom's Gate to be endued with it, and when through the operation of the
same divine Life and Power, opened in her, she spoke in Power, and
demonstration of the Spirit, and great Wisdom, so that she was a Comfort,
Refreshing and Edifying unto all, to the building of us up in our most holy
Faith, so it often rose in me, That the Words of the Wise are as Apples of Gold
in Pictures of Silver, and Wisdom is Justified of her Children; for so it was
indeed, for as she Lived so she Dyed in universal Love to all, but more
especially to the Household of Faith, for whom her Prayers was Night and Day,
that they might be keep pure and clean, without Spot or Wrinkle, or any such
thing: O she was an upright Woman in her day, and the Lords powerful presence
was with her, from the beginning unto the end, to the laying down of her Head
in Peace, and is at rest with the Lord, and I am fully satisfied concerning it,
and my Soul blesses the Lord on her behalf, and magnifies his Name, who is
worthy of all Praises, and Glory, and Honor forever, Amen, amen,

Ann Mackett.

A TESTIMONY concerning Ann Whitehead.
Dear Friends,
THere was a concern upon me in a short Testimony to give in amongst you, with
whom my Soul has Unity, concerning our dear and tender Friend Ann Whitehead;
that she was a Woman whom the Lord greatly honored with a large measure of his
heavenly Wisdom and Power, and in that she was made able to speak aword in
season to the strengthening of the Weak and the bowed down one, and many living
Testimonies she bore amongst us in brokenness of Spirit, and in that heart
melting love of God, in which I can truly say, my Soul has often been livingly
refreshed, with the Souls of many more. Friends my Heart is overcome, and my
Spirit bowed down at this time, in a living sense of our loss, which indeed is
very great, the Lord make it up unto us, in continuing his presence amongst us,
and in a sense thereof strength will be administered to do the Work of the Lord
acceptably, fot this was the Labor and Travel of our dear and wel-beloved
Friend, whilst she was amongst us, That all be done in Love, in the blessed
order of Truth, and where any thing happened contrary, it became her Burden, for
she delighted in the prosperity of Truth, and in them that lived in it; this is
my Testimony (from a certain knowledge of her) in my measure, though one of the
least amongst you; yet as one whom the Lord had reached unto in visiting my
Soul in his everlasting Love and Power, in the day of my Affliction, and hour
of Temptation which my Soul was under, then did the Lord appear in his
unlimitted power for my preservation, and limited the power of Satan, so that
deliverance was witnessed to my Soul. And this Servant and Handmaid of the Lord
traveled amongst us, whom he has removed from amongst us, but to her great
advantage, for she rests from her Labors and her Works follow her, the
memorial of whom will Live forever in the Hearts of all the Faithful; O Lord
that it may be thus with me, and with all thy whole Heritage is the cry of my
Soul: This lay as a weight upon me being eased, I desire to rest fully
satisfied in the will of the Lord,

London, 25th of October 1686. Elizabeth Haynes Senior

A short TESTIMONY for Ann Whitehead.
COncerning dear Ann Whitehead, and my truly loving Friend, whom I have kown
above 20 Years, I have this in my Heart to say, That she was a Good Woman,
fearing God, and doing that which was right in his sight; having a Tender
Heart, and a Charitable Mind; being a Help to the Poor, and a Strength to the
Weak; doing always what she did for the Lord and his blessed Truth-sake. Oh,
how good has her Counsel been, and how sweet and refreshing were her Words
unto me many a time, which begat great Love in my Heart toward her, and a true
Sorrow for her removal, because of the great loss and miss, I know there will
be of her among Friends. Well, but the will of the Lord must be submitted to,
and we therewith contented, for she is at Rest and Peace with our God, there to
abide in everlasting Happiness forever and evermore.

Dear Ann is gone unto her Rest,
Of Women sure, one of the Best;
True Wisdom had she from above,
Filled with Virtue and true Love;
So that to us her loss was such,
Caused Tears and Sorrow very much:
But since it does to us befall,
And God did to himself her call;
Let us beg of him that he will,
Our Women with his Spirit fill,
And make them able to withstand
Truth's Opposers on every hand,
Till they Gods Work have finished,
And all in Peace laid down the head,
And Crowned with Glory in Heaven,
So let it be, O Lord, Amen.
Jane Soul.

A TESTIMONY concerning Ann Whitehead.
COncerning our dear and wel-beloved Friend Ann Whitehead, whom I truly Loved
and Honored in the Lord for the Truth's sake. This Testimony arises in my
Heart: It was her faithfulness to the Truth that made her truly honorable,
that is her Crown, and is now set upon her Head for evermore: She having set
her House in order, the Lord has gathered her, by his gentle hand, into Rest
and Peace, where her Reward is sure with him, and through her Faith in Christ
Jesus, and her steadfastness in the Truth, she has obtained a good Report in
her Day and Generation: She truly Loved, Feared and Served the true and living
God, being made subject to the Truth through the mighty Power of God: She was
adorned and furnished by the Truth with a good Understanding, true Wisdom and
sound Judgment, to discern between things that differ, whereby she was made a
very serviceable Member in the Church of Chrst, and a Mother in Israel to many
Children, ministering the Word in due season, suitable to every State and
Condition; and I can truly say, we have been often Refreshed and Comforted
together in the Lord, and one in another in our Women's Meetings, where the
Weak and Feeble have been strengthened, and that which was heady and high
abased and brought low, and Truth over all exalted, and we as Members, of that
one Body, of which Christ Jesus our Lord is the Head, build up together a
spiritual Houshhold unto God: And this was the Labor and Travel of our dear
Friend and faithful Labourer in the Work and Service of the Lord, who was
therein drawn forth to visit us at our Quarterly Meeting, at the Bull and Mouth
the 5th of 5th Month 86. and it was the last public Meeting she was at amongst
us, for she was then weak in Body, yet she was strong in the Lord, and in the
power of his might was she enabled to bear a faithful Testimony for the Truth
against all such that made a profession of it, and was high and lifted up above
the pure fear of the Lord, and that measure of Truth which many had received
and been partakers of in the beginning; also signifying of what little value
all the Glory, Pride, vain Fashions, Customs and Friendships of this World
are, and how they all pass away, and will not stand any one in stead in the day
of account, which will certainly overtake all; therefore she exhorted and
labored in the Word of Truth, that all might be warned against, and awakened
out of all those things which grieves the good Spirit of the Lord, and are
contrary to the pure mind and will of God, that so your Souls might live to God
through your obedience to the Truth, and the operation of his Power (which
works in them that believe) to do those things which are acceptable in his
Sight, that God over all may be glorified, for he alone is worthy of all Glory
and Praise for evermore. Oh, that we which yet remain, may be found following
the footsteps of this our dear Friend, as she followed Christ, leaving us a
good example in all manner of god-like Conversation: She was a pattern of
Wisdom and Sobriety, and her Integrity to God was manifested through her labor
of Love, and faithful Service for the Truth's-sake. In her Life time she sought
the good of all, and at her Death manifested her Love the same to all, being
sweetly kept in a living Enjoyment of true Peace and Rest with the Lord, her
Love flowed forth uoto all the whole Flock and Family of God, desiring that we
might all live in Love, And the God of Peace (said she) be with you, preserve
you and keep you all in true Love Peaece and Unity with himself and one with
another. And in this peaceable frame of Spirit, I am satisfied, that this our
dear Friend resigned and gave up to the will of the Lord, as in her Life time,
so at her Death, having fought the good Fight, finished her Course, and kept
the Faith, and is at Rest with the Lord, and her Memory is blessed forever.

Susanna Dew.
AND I was truly glad I had an oppertunity to visit her in the time of her
weakness, for I was Comforted and well refreshed with the rest of my Friends
then present, in the feeling, and enjoyment of that Love and Life, which still
lives and will remain with all the upright in Heart. And although her Body be
removed from us; her memory lives in that which is beyond words. So unto that
pure everlasting Power (which works in us and for us both to will and to do
according to his good pleasure) be all Glory and Honor, with Everlasting pure
holy Praises it ascends and is ascribed and given unto him that lives for ever
and for evermore.

A TESTIMONY FOR Ann Whitehead.
A Living Testimony springs in my Heart, concerning that worthy Friend and
Sister, yea Mother, for so she was to many, Anne Whitehead, who was endued with
much Wisdom from above, and one of great Courage, with godly Zeal in the Work
and Service of the Lord, and a godly care she had over the Flock and Family of
the Lord; oh, often would she come forth in our Womens-Meeting with a living
Testimony, which has much refreshed my Heart and Soul, and I doubt not but
many more can say the same with me, stirring up the pure Mind in many, and
often did exhort all to see how, and in what they were gathered; often did the
Spirit of God move on her Heart, to put all in mind, that they might have their
Minds exercised in their own Gift; oh the great care she had to exalt the Name
and Power of the Lord over all, and that all might come to feel the Power to
administer Life to their Souls: Blessed be the Lord, and Magnified be his pure
and holy Name! I have often felt him in the midst of our Assembles as an
overflowing Fountain, and that our own have overflowed, to the praise and glory
of his Name; this is not to adore the Creature, but that as she was a faithful
Follower of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, so we may be found walking in her
steps; that as I am fully satisfied this dear and wel-beloved one has finished
her Course, and laid down her Head in perfect Peace with the Lord, and is
enrered into her Rest, it may be so with us: Dear Ann is fallen asleep, yet
does her memorial live, and will be had in everlasting remembranee. So dear
Friends, let us be diligent in our places, and be found good Examples, as dear
Ann was in her Day, being nursing Mothers, and Patterns of Gravity to those
Young Ones that are coming up, that they may have cause to praise the Lord on
our behalfs, as a remnant has on behalf of her that is gone, and we must
follow, the Lord knows how soon; therefore dear and wel-beloved, let us in all
things be careful, that we set no bad example to any, neither in our Habit or
Behavior; I have seen much in my time, since the Lord convinced me of his ever
blessed Truth, that lawful things have not been expedient in Apparel, as well
as other things: So dear Friends, this is the true desire of my Heart and Soul,
and the breathing of my Spirit, that we may walk so circumspect in our Day, Age
and Generation, so that when our Change comes, we may lay down our Heads in
Peace also, to the Praise and Glory of the great Name of the Lord our God, who
is worthy of all Honor, Glory and living Thanksgiving, not only at this time,
but henceforth and for evermore, Amen.

Mary Plumsted.

MAny are the Testimonies concerning our dear Friend and Sister Ann Whitehead,
who was a Mother in Israel; and indeed our loss was her gain, for she is
entered into her Rest, which the Lord has prepared for those that love his
Appearance, and are obedient to his Requirings, and have followed him through
many Tribulations as our dear Friend did. In the beginning when God's Truth did
first appear in this City, then she became honorable therein, by her cleaving
thereto in her Youth, and has continued therein to her old Age, and has been
honored above many; and now my dear Friends, that we may all follow her
example is my desire, that am your Sister in the holy Truth.

Elizabeth Camfield.

A TESTIMONY FOR Ann Whitehead.
Serious Reader
IT cannot be sufficiently lamented that we live in an Age that abounds with
profane blasphemous Atheists, sprung, out of various sorts of Apostates from
the way of Truth, whose unclean Hearts are filled with envy against such as
have followed God faithfully in their day, and their Mouths with mocking and
railing Accusations, endeavoring to bury their Names, Testimony and Sufferings
for God: It is meet and needful, in such a time, that there should be some to
speak for God, and the way of Truth, and for those that have faithfully served
him in their Generation, and are fallen asleep, for so the holy Apostle spoke
of David: Thus the Spirit of God in ages past has commemorated the Names and
Services of his faithful Followers, and are not their Names and Services this
day fresh and sweet amongst us, as precious Odor, even from righteous Abel to
this day? Is not the holy Apostles Catalogue, and cloud of Witnesses, mentioned
in the Hebrews, of living and fresh savor and edification in the Church in
this our day? observe how frequently in all his Epistles he commemorates the
Names and Services of the eminently faithful, and that the Disciples showed
Dorcas's good Works; and holy John commemorates the Names of those that loved
the Truth; which justifeth the same practice now, and reproves the Atheistical
Cavellers of our day, that being secretly convicted in their Consciences of
Apostasy from God, become deriders of the Names and Services of the Joshuas and
Calebs in our age, upon whom the Apostle has eternized a just motto, That they
please not God, and are contrary to all good men. Dear Friends, all feel in
your day and time, that comfort, that is, in that God has set apart the godly
for himself; these are called his Jewels, and God says in Malachy, They shall
be mine: My Heart is inditing good matter amongst the Lovers of Zion, that
favor her Dust, and takes pleasure in her Stones, they shall prosper indeed
that love her. And I feel constraining in my Spirit to cast in my Mite of
Testimony amongst others, concerning our dear Friend Ann Whitehead, of whom I
had large Testimony, that the Spirit of God plentifully dwelt in her, branching
forth it self in many eminent Services for God, so that she may well be
commemorated as a Mother in Israel, that was filled with Zeal for the building
of Gods House; the Apostle spakes of some that were the first Fruits of Achaia,
commemorates their Services, and exhorts the Church to acknowledge such: This
godly Woman was of the first Fruits of London in this our day, who has left a
sweet Testimony in the Hearts of Thousands, that she sought not her own things,
but the things of Christ; my own experience of Gods honoring her with his Soul
consolating presence was large in many Years holy Communion in our retired
Meetings, where God often filled her Vessel with the Water of Life, to the
reaching and refreshing of many Souls: That day must never be forgot, when her
Testimony was indeed as the dew and small Rain to the tender Herbs; so that I
was made to say, where is the Scribe? where is the Wise and Disputers of this
World? meeting with him who is the Glory of Israel, whom my Soul sought after,
through Instruments despised by this World, amongst whom, oh Ann, thou art
numbered, and shall everlastingly shine as a Star in the hand of him that
sits upon the Throne; and though as to the mortal thou art removed, yet art
present in the general Assembly and Church of the Firstborn, who having washed
their Robes in the Blood of the Lamb, with Harps in these Hands, Sing the Song
of Moses and of the Lamb, Great and Marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty,
Just and True are thy Ways, thou King of Saints.

A general TESTIMONY for Ann Whitehead.
DEar Friends in the blessed Truth, to whom this Treatise may come, we tenderly
salute you in the Lord, and further declare and signify unto you, that though
these foregoing Christian Testimonies were written apart by particular Friends,
as they felt a necessity come upon them, in commemoration of the Christian
Conversation, holy Example, weighty Service and blessed End of our truly
beloved and faithful Sister in Christ Ann Whitehead, yet the said foregoing
Testimonies are so concurrent in themselves, bespaking one and the same
spiritual Sense and Judgment in many Witnesses, and so clearly agreeing with
the general Sense, Knowledge and Experience of our Womens-Meeting in London, to
whom the Faithfulness, Labor of Love, Care and Diligence of our said Sister
was well known, that our said Meeting does unanimously own and recommend the
same to all our faithful Friends and Sisters in Christ, of other
Womens-Meetings, in this and other Nations. Though God is our record, it is not
to admire the Person or exalt the Creature above its place, that these things
are written and recommended, but to magnify the Power and Goodness of the Lord
our God, and his divine Grace and Gifts in his Creature, as manifest in this
his day, who works both immediately and instrumentally, as he teaches and
instructs, both by himself alone and by his faithful Witnesses, according to
his good pleasure. The Holy One in these his VVays and Works is not to be
limited, but we ought to admire his great Wisdom, to consider his great
Kindness to us in all his Ways, and daily to pray unto him, who is the Father
of Spirits, that we may both daily feel his immediate Counsel in our Hearts,
and follow their Faith and Christian Example of Love, Peace and Concord, who
have thereby left a good Report, and such lively Impressions upon tho Hearts of
a Remnant, as may not be raced out, nor easily forgotten. God Almighty preserve
us all faithful in his Work and Service, and in his pure Love, blessed Unity,
and heavenly Order of his holy Spirit of Life, in Christ Jesus our Lord, unto
the end of our Days, Amen.
