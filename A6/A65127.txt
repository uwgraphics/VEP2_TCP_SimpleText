THE VIRTUES OF CHOCOLATE East India Drink.
BY this pleasing drink health is preserved, sickness diverted, It cures
Consumptions and Cough of the Lungs; it expells poison, cleanses the teeth,
and sweetneth the Breath; provokes Urine; cures the stone and strangury,
makes Fatt and Corpulent, fair and aimeable, it cures the running of the
Reins, with sundry other desperate Diseases; It causes Conception according to
these Verses, Nor need the Women longer grieve,
Who spend their oil yet not Conceive,
For it is a Help Immediate,
If such but Lick of Chocolate.


Beauty gaind and continued, as this verse speaks, The Nut-Browne Lasses of
the Land,
Whom Nature veiled in Face and hand,
Are quickly Beauties of High-Rate,
By one small Draught of Chocolate.


It is impossible to innumerate all new and admirable effects then producing
every day in such as drink it, therefore I Will leave the Judgment of it, to
those who daily make a continual proof of it.
