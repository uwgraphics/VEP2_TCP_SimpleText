The TRIUMPHING English Commanders, Or the Rebels Overthrow and utter
Desolation.
To the Tune of the Thundering Cannons roar.
This may be Printed,

R. L. S.

I.
HOld! the numerous Carriages!
Fraughted strongly to possess
All the Kingdoms great and less,
Of Mighty JAMES the Gracious;
Since it is His own by Birth and Right,
Against the Traitors let us Fight,
And make it only our delight
To kill the Rogues that face us.
II.
Douglas and his Warlike Train,
Triumphs over the Woods and Plain,
But not disturb the peaceful Swain,
Unless James Scot they favor;
Then the dying endless Cries
Of such Rogues, shall rend the Skies,
Expecting still their Destinies,
'Cause they of Rebels Savor.
III.
Infinit's the Loyal Host,
Has ring round the Western-Coast,
Waiting on poor Monmouths Ghost,
Whom they resolve to fetter;
With a Shackle and a Chain,
(A just reward of's evil Brain)
And after rid him out of pain,
'Cause he would be no better.
IV.
The Rebels now do Glaston reach,
And where they go, Rebellion Teach,
And still the Good Old Cause they Preach,
And pray for Ignoramus;
Whilst the Dukes and Hero's brave,
Contrive the Faction to enslave;
Monmouth seeks his Neck to save,
But he shall never sham us.
V.
Great Albermarl, and Sommerset,
Grafton, Beaufort, are all met,
And Perkin they have all beset,
And on the Boors are waiters;
Pembrook, likewise them does join,
And Feversham with them combine,
Whose Glories do the Sun outshine,
TO Eclipse that of the Traitors.
VI.
Churchill too, the West Invades,
(With his Glorious merry Lads,
Whose great Honor never fades)
To subdue the Faction:
The Loyal Army troop along,
Through the Towns and Fields they throng,
And hunt by Scent, which lies so strong,
For it smells Association.
VII.
May Mars inspire the res'lute Souls,
And Bacchus fill the ebbing Bowls
Of all the Loyal English-Poles,
TO inspire them and their Horses;
The Martial God with his glittering shield,
Will grant no Quarter in the Field,
To Rebels, till he makes 'em yield,
To his unconquered Forces.
VIII.
When the mighty Cannons drown,
The noise of Bells, and every sound,
From the vastest Wiltshire-down,
Against Perkin and the Rebels;
Then we'll recharge, and give no breath
To Traitors, but pursue their death,
And after Triumph over the Heath,
In spite of Wiggesh Libells.
IX.
View the mighty flowing Main!
Swelled above the lofty Plain!
With the Vitals of the slain,
(Rewards for all the Evils)
Of the Traitors; let us destroy
Every member for the ROY;
Then return again with joy,
That we have subdued the Devils.
Loayl Subjects now rejoice,
Drums, and Trumpets make a noise,
Drink a cup and sing Brave Boys
Good health to James the Royal.
Loyalty's a noble thing,
Service done unto a King
Honor and Reward does bring;
Then let us still be Loyal.
FINIS.
