IS this to Deny the Popes Supremacy? to wear his Robes and Livery, to worship
in his Form, and contrary to the Form and Power of God. O ye Hypocrites! Have
ye made the Outside White, like the Saints? But like he Pope, Is not the Inside
Black as Hell and Death? Is not he Lamb of God Slain in you? Are ye not the
s;piritual Egypt and Sodom, in which Christ is Crucified?

What! Do ye appear like Sheep Outwardly, whilst Within there lodges all
manner of Putrefaction? O ye Graves, Tombs, and Painted Sepulchers! Rottenness,
Stinks and Corruption are ye filled withal. Oh! ye are a Stink in the Nostrils
of the pure God; your Singing is no better than the Howling of Dogs: Ye appear,
and are Transformed as Angels of Light in White Linen, whiles;t the Black Vail,
and Cloud of Error is over your Hearts; and the mist of thick Darkness are ye
filled withal your Selves.

What! Areye Singing, whilst the Lords Spirit does Mourn, and the Lamb of God
slain in you? And is not your Hearts sad, and condemnation upon your Spirits at
the same time? Is this to make Melody in your Hearts to the Lord? Can the Dead
praise Him, and they that lie in the Pit Celebrate his Truth! Nay, it is the
Living, The Living that can make known his Truth: Can the Grave praise Him? Or
can his Loving Kindness be declared in Death, or his Faithfulness in the Land
of Destruction, and shadow of Death?

Repent ye Idolaters, and Mock the Lord no longer, or else he wilI Destroy you,
and that without Remedy.

I bare my Testimony against the Popes Supremacy amongst you QUERISTERS.

Humphry Woolrich.
