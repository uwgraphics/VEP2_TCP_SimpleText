Prologue declaryng to whom this book apperteyneth
Considering that words ben perisshyng / vain / and forgeteful / And
writings duelle and abide permane^t / as I read Vox audita perit / littera
scripta man^t / Thise things have caused that the faites and deeds of A^meyent
men^ / ben set by declaracion in fair and Aourned volumes / to then^de that
science and Arts learned and founden of things passed might be had in
perpetuel memory and remembrance / ffor the hertes of nobles in eschewyng of
ydlenes at such time as they have none other virtuous ocupaco^n on hand
ought texcersise them in redyng / studyng / and visytyng the noble faytes and
deeds of the sage and wysemen sometime tr^^uaillyng in prouffytable virtues / of
whom it happeth often that so^men ben enclyned to visyte the books treatyng of
sciences particular / And other to read and visyte books spekyng of faytes of
arms / of love / or of other meruaillous histories / And emonge all other
this p^sent book which is called the image or myrrour of the world / ought to
be visyted / read / and known / by cause it treats of the world and of the
wondreful dyuision thereof / in which book a man reasonable / may see and
understand more clerer by the visytyng and seeing of it and the figures therein
/ the situaco^n and moeuyng of the firmament / and how the universal earth
hangs in the myddle of the same / As ye chapitres here following shall more
clerly show and declare to you / which said book was translated out of latin
in to ffrensshe by the ordinance of the noble duc / Johan of Berry and
Auuergne the year of our lord.M.CC.xlv. And now at this time rudely translated
out of ffrensshe in to Englissh by me simple person william Caxton / at the
request. desire. cost and dispense of the honorable and worshipful man Hugh^
Bryce Alderman and Cytezeyn of london / entendyng to present the same unto the
virtuous noble and puissaunt lord / wylliam lord hastynges lord Chamberlayn
unto the most Christian king / king Edward the fourth king of England and of
ffraunce etc and lieuten^nt for the same of the town of Calais and marches
there whom he humbly besecheth to resseyue in gree and thank / which book
conteyneth in all lxxvij chapitres / and xxvij figures / without which it may
not lightly be understand / And for to declare more openly / it is ordained in
three parties / Of which the first co^teyneth xx chapitres and viij figures /
The second party xxxiij chapitres / and ix figures / And the therde
conteyneth xxiiij chapitres and.x. figures / which was engrossed and in all
points ordained by chapitres and figures in ffrenshe in the town of beuggis
the year of thyncarnacion of our lord.M.CCCC.lxiiij. in the month of Iuyn /
And emprised by me right unable and of lytil connyng to translate and bring it
in to our maternal tongue ye second day of the month of janyuer the yer of our
said lord.M.CCCClxxx in thabbay of westmestre by london / humbly requyryng all
them that shall find fault / to correct and amend where as they shall any
find / And of such so fou^den that they repute not the blame on me / but on
my copy / which j am charged to follow as nyghe as god will give me grace /
whom j most humbly beseech to give me scyence^ connyng and life taccomplysshe
and well to fynysshe it etc /

Then who so will comprise and understand the substance of this present
volume / for to learn and know specially the creacion. of this world / the
gretnes of the firmament and lytilnes of therthe in regard of heaven / how the
vij sciences were ffounden and what they be / by which he may the better
auaylle in knowleche all the days of his life / Then late him read this said
volume treatably. auisedly. and ordynatly that in such thing as he shall read /
he suffer nothing to pass / but that he understand it right well / And so may
he know and understand veritably the declaracion of this said volume / And he
then that so will obey this commandment / May by the conte^te of the same
learn great party of the form and condition of this world / And how by ye
will of our lord it was by him created made and accomplisshed / And the cause
wherefore it was establisshid / whereof the debonayr lord has don to us so great
grace / that we ever ben bounden to give him lawde and worship / or else we
had not ben of any value / ne worth any thing / no more than unreasonable beestis
/ Then late us pray the maker and creator / of all cratures god all mighty
that at the begyninyg of this book it list him of his most bounteuous grace to
depart with us of the same that we may learn / and that learned to reteyne /
and that retained so teache / that we may have so parfyght science and knowleche
of god / that we may get thereby the health of our sowles / and to be partyners
of his glory permanent and without end in heaven Amen /

Hi^^ begins the book callid the myrrour of the world / And treats first
of the power and puissaunce of god capitulo primo.
YE ought to know that when our lord god made the world And that he had made
all things of naught / he had no need of it / ffor as much had he before /
as he had afterward Certainly god was to fore / and shall be incessantly after /
without end. and without beginning / Then he shall nothing amend ne be
better ffor him faylled never any thing / he sees all / hereth all know^h
all / and holds all thing in his hand / he had never hunger / ne thirst.
ne time. ne day. ne hour / but abides co^tynuelly in all good / ffor to him
ne apperteyneth soon ne late / and of all them that ever were. that been. and
shall be. have always ben and shall be to fore his eyes as well the far as the
nyghe / and the evil as the good he saw as well the world (...) it was made
and fourmed as he does now at this day / And if he had never made the world /
as much had he ben then worth / and of as great valewe as he ever might have
be / ffor otherwise he might not be god / if he knew not / saw. and herd
all that might be / and if he were not so / he should be lackyng and not
mighty of every thing / And of so much he was and should be a mortal man / bus
his nature was not such / ffor he is god entierly and hool without beginning
and without end / Nothing is to him new ne old / All weel and good thingis
ben his / by right / And by nature goon / and return again to him / ffor fro
him all thing proceed and meue / And retornyng to him in holdyng the right
way / he retcheth never of any harm / ffor his bou^te is all pure. clean.
hool and cler^ without any espece of evil Certes all euyllis ben to him
contraryes / And therefore it is pure necessite that they wythdrawe them under
him and fro all his goodness / ffor it is nothing but donge and ordure / which
must needs descend in to the deppest / And the good thingis must needs goo
upward tofore the souerayn creator which is clear net and pure / And the
sins which ben obscure. horrible and derke above all other thing leven the
good which is about god and auale and goo down / ffor so behooves it to be by
rayson and nature / All in like wise as we see the ordure of the wyn that is
put in the vessel / and the foul departs fro the clear / in such wise as
the good and clear abides above / And the lie which is thordure abides
byneth in the bottom as infecte and not good / And the good wyn that is above
abides always clear and fyn / And that which is not good that is byneth in the
bottom abides always obscure. foul. and black / and so much the more as the
wyn is good and more clear / somoche more reteyneth the lie more of filthe and
obscure / Thus is it of the good / and evil / ffor the evil must descend in
to places derke and horrible / and full of all sorrow and bitterness / And so
much more as the good shyneth to fore god and the more it ioyeth / so much
the more sorrow and derknesse is in hell / where it is contynuell and shall be
as long as god shall be in heaven / where as god has all goodness to fore him
and alleway shall have without pain. without trauayl / and without grief or
Annoye / he has all / and all he enlumyneth without any defaulte and
without any term / God may make all thing / and all deffete or unmake
without changyng him self in any thing that may be / ffor he may all and
conceyu^th all / There is nothing that may hurt him / he is establed without
any meuyng / And all meuynges meue of him / An hundred thousand year mount
not to him so much as the thousand part of one only hour of this world / ne
to all them that be in heaven / of which the least that abides there has
more Joy in an hour only / and of deduyte soulace gladness and of honor of
which he shall never be weary ne full / than any man may think ne know ne
esteem in this world in an hundred thousand year if he might so long live and
endure / thaugh he were the most subtyl of all the men that ever were born or
ever shall be / thaugh he thought the best he might / Of this so great and
jnestimable glory is god the very and souerayn lord without any other / as
god that all knows and all sees / all that ever that has been / all that
is / and all that ever shall be / and all that belongs to him / him faylled
never any thing that is good / he has hem alleway tofore him / ner there was
never any good thing ne never shall be / but that it was pourtrayed to fore him
/ before the creacion of the world / Now ye shall here why and wherefore god
created and made the world /

Wherefore god made and created the world / capitulo ijo
GOd made and created all the world of his only will by cause that he might
have sum thing that might besuche / as might deserve of his weel and goodness
if it were not in his defaulte And therefore he establisshid this world /
Nothing for that he should be the better / ne that he had any need / But he
did it for charity and by his great debonarete / ffor as right charitable / he
would that other should part with him of his weel and goodness / And that all
other creatures euerich after his nature should feel of his puissance after
that it might apperteyne to him / Thus would god establisshe this world / that
such thing should issue that might understand and know the noblesse of his
power and of his sapyence / and also of the good that he made for the man
erthely / that he might serve him in such manner / that by him he might deserve
the great weel and good that he had made for him / Then ought we above all
other thing to love him and thank him that made and fourmed us / When we have
such power and such auctorite by him / that if we will love him we shall be
lords of all goods / Now love we him then with all our might / and then
shall we do as wise men And if we do not we shall have great harm and damage
ffor if we by our cause lose such goods as our lord has made for us / yet
for all that god shall lose nothing / Certainly he made them to the end that we
should have them / sith that by our good deeds we might conne deserve them and
that he of his grace has given to us the wit. thentendement and the power /

Wherefore god fourmed man like unto his image and to his semblau^ce capitulo iijo
When god fourmed man he would make and create him like unto his image and
semblaunce / to the end that he should have remembrance of the goods that he
had lent him / and that he mygh^t deserve them all by right and raison / ffor
he shewde to him so great love / that above all other creatures he fourmed him
to his figure and semblaunce / And gaf to him naturelly right parfyght
understanding for to love and know him more than any other thing / to the end
that he might part more largely of his goods than any other creature / Ne god
did never ne made for other creature so many good things / as he has made
for man / But who is he that will deserve them And if he do not / it is Reason
that he sorrow / ffor he does to god no bounte / that does well for to have his
grace and his love / ffor he does it more for his owen prouffyt / than he does
it for other / And there for he does well that loves and seruyth him / ffor
much may he call him self Caytyf and meschaunt / that by his folly leseth so
hye / so noble and so excellent glory / ffor his sin that prouffyteth him
naught / And has not in the end but shame and blame / And draws him in to
such a place where is no thing but pain / ire / sorrow / and heaviness / of
which he shall never see him delyuerd as long as he lives Thus has he lost
the great joye* that was given to him / which is taken away by his sin / And
might have been a lord if he had would / if he had mayntened him self in doing
always good works / and would have absteyned and kept him fro doing evil /
ffor who that does well in this world he has so much good and honor / that
thangels of heaven make him their lord and maistre / by fore god king of all
kings / Then he may well hold him for ewrous and happy that does so much
good in earth during his life that may conquer and have this honor / And that
may every person do all for him self if it pleseth him / Now late euerych do
as him good shall seem / and take which that he will / for he may win by
doing well / and also lose by doing evil /

Wherefore god made not the man / such as he might not sin capitulo iiijo
When our lord god created the man / he gaf to him power to do his fre will /
That is to wete to do good or evil which he would / ffor if god had made the
man such as he might not have sinned ne to have don nothing but well / he
should have take from him somewhat of his power / ffor he might not then have
don evil when it had plesyd him / And then it should have followed / that would
he or not / he should always have done weel without reason / And thus he should
not have been cause of the good that he should have done / but it should have
proceeded of another which by force should have caused him and have given him
the will / And he / by the moyen of that he so should do / should deserve the
gwerdon / and not only he / ffor lityl deserves he that by force of other does
seruyse / who that to morrow should put me in a strong prison against my will
for to do good / I should not hold him for wise / ffor he should do me wrong
/ Nevertheless it was well in our lords power if it had plesed him to have made
man such that he should not have sinned ne have don any harm ne evil / But he
had not deseruid yet such merit ne reward as he now does in no time of the
world / And therefore god gaf to man plain fre will to do weel or evil to
the end that in weel doing and leuyng the evil he might have more merit / ffor
otherwise he might not deserve so much / if god had made thangels such as
might not have sinned dedly / ne have don evil ffor that yet should not they
deserve so noble a yefte as the men / And who that will deserve these hye
merytes / he ought gladly with entier heart and parfyght serve by great love
and great Reverence him that has made him for to conquer and come to the most
hye honor / And our lord god would that man were such / that by right he
might deserve as much good a boute him as he him self has / And therefore he
gaf to him wit and reason for to have entencion to him / ffor by right he
ought well to serve him / Then is he a much fool that pourueyeth not to do
well whilis he is here living / ffor all the good that every man shall do /
shall be for him self / And all the evil also / And each man shall have for one
good thing / an hundred good things / and for one evil an hundred euillis /
ffor he is a much fool that weneth to do to god any bounte of his goodis in
any maniere that it be / And when he absteyneth him fro doing evil / so much
our lord holds him the derrer / and loves him the better / ffor if he lost
all the world / our lord should never be the less worth / ne none of the
goodis that been in his power / if all the saints that ever here to fore in
the world or ever shall be / had never don good / And that all by her demerytes
were perpetuelly dampened in hell / yet for all that our lord god should never
have the less joye ne consolacion / And should not be the less worth / ne no
thing that is in heaven / But the saints were wise. prudent. and constaunt for
to do weel and prouffyt / as they that plainly knew that this world is not
but a wyn thing and tran^itoire And had much lever to suffer pains and
trauaylles / and offer their bodies to tourme^t and martirdom and to have
shames / blasphemies and other injuries for the love of our lord in this
miserable world that so litil while endures / and to have the goods of heaven
ever lastyng / than to have ease chau^geable to the body / for to have pain
perdurable / They retched not ne had no charge of such goodis that at last
should be of no value But they took the bridle by the teeth for to get the
right hye wit and understanding of heaven And there ben many of them that hold
them for foolis in this world / the which now at this time have their neckis
charged / of which the other be deliuyd / ffor they ben herberowed in heaven /
And yet hold they many a wise man for fool that preyse not much their words
/ There ben plente of wise people in heaven now / that if they had preysed the
folissh dictes or sayengis and the folissh werkis of the people that so much
coueyte the hauoir and loos of this world for the word of foles / that they
had left the commandemens of god / In which the saints in heaven did gretely
their deuoyr / ffor they left not for the delytes of the world to serve their
maker and creator for to get heaven where they have joye and all honor as
they that been lords and shall ben without end / And if they had don otherwise
/ they should have perpetuelly shame fylthe and tourmentis of hell where as ben
all the euyllys that man can devise / It is much great meruaylle of this
world how that it is so / that there ben so much people that will suffer pain
and trauaylle more for to get loos of the people / or for to amasse great
tresours / the which so lytil time abide with hem / that in an only hour they
faylle / than they will do for to co^quere the goods of our lord the which
shall never faylle / which the blessid saints have gotten by a lytil hard life
that they have endured in this world that ne seems but a right delight to them
that of good heart do it / And in the end it seems to them / that for lytil or
naught they have gotten heaven / and all thus may every person get it / and be
common of the goods of our lord and have the joys and glory of heaven / if the
defaulte be not in him self / But they that desire the joys the glory and
honors of this world / they empayre them self so much that they may not learn
no good ne entende to their sauacion / And had much lieuer the ease and
consolations of the body of which they ben so sone put out / and brought to
sorrow and pain than they do the ease of the foul which endures without
end / Ne they preyse not the wit ne entendement of the man / if he can not
well have him in the world and have plente of temporel goods / by which he may
be enhaunsed and lift up in the world / but say he is nyce and folissh by
cause he can not their malices and cawteles / But all they ben cursed of god
by the mouth of david the prophet that so pain them to plese the world by
all the ways that they can do / ffor such pride is vain thing by which
the soul is eupayred / of whom david says in the psaulter Acursid be all
they and confused / as people of exyle that playse the world / ffor of all
goods they extend them and discord fro god and fro his love / sith they have
given them and that they acorde them to the world to his vanytees and delytes /
ffor god has them all in despyte / and put them fro his grace / by cause they
seche the loos and the glory / of the world / in which he was put out and
set a back and in the end crucyfyed and holden for a fool Thus says our lord
god in his gospel / that all they shall be blessed that have the world in
despyte / And shall be as people hated defowled and cast out as foles for the
love of me and of my name / ffor they shall have in heaven their reward and
guerdoun / And this may every man see if god him self lie not / And truth may
not be false / that they which plese the world / and will have and take the
loos and glory of the world / it may not be but they after have sorrow /
Therefore he is a fool that secheth to have it / by cause all they that weeshe
or pourchace it / be evil counceylled / ffor all such manner of people ben by
the devil led in to hell where they have a right soroufull guerdoun / And
there is nowher so valiant a king ne so puissaunte prince duc / earl. knight
or noble man to whom the devil has regard but that he do to him as much
grief to his power / as to the most vile and most pour that comes in to hell
/ when he has so used his days and life that he is fallen in his hondes / ffor
all they that been dampened for to goo theder of what estat that they be / ben
all called Rybauldis / ffor he mocht have conquered in heaven more noble and
more worthy Roya^me than is in this world / ffor who that in this world serves
our lord unto the death / he is more honored in heaven than all the kings that
ever were in this world that so litil endures with us / Now serve we him
then and leave we the evil / the glory and the vanyte of this world / Sith
then that hereto fore we have devised how and wherefore god has created the
world and wherefore he made man / we shall devise to you herafter the form of
the world and the facyon after that it conteyneth and compriseth / And how it
is made and composed round about / But it is expedyent that to fore this we
speak of the vij Arts liberals and of their resons / And how they were founden
by them that apperceyued the sciences and virtues / ffor by the vij Arts ben
known the faytes of the world And how it is set / And therefore we owe now to
speak thereof for to understand the better that we shall say here after /

Wherefore and how the vij Arts liberal were founden and of their order /
capitulo vo
NOw declares this book which is drawn out of Astronomye how sometime the
notable and wise philosophres would enquere of the manner of the world / and how
hit had been created and made of god / whereof much people meruaylled / And
then when the world was made and compassed / there was people ynowhe / Of
which many beheld the firmament / that turned round about the world / and
meuyd / they had great meruaylle how it might be made / And they waked and
studied many nyghtes and many days / Then began they to behold the sterres
that roos in the cest / and meued about over their hedes Certainly thise
philosophres apetyted not these great mangeries ne delicyous wynes ne for to
fille their belyes / as don beestis that seche nothing but their pasture /
like as this day do they that retche of nothing but to fylle their paunche
with good wynes and good vitailles and after to have a fair bed. white shetes
and soft / and there to sleep as the swyne But those were wakyng and studyeng
many nyghtes and it grieved them not / but they were embelisshid much of that
they saw the firmament thus torn and so nobly to hold his course and terms
Thus saw they the sterres meue til they went down in the weste / sum on that
one side / and sum on the other side / And sum sonner than the other Thus
beheld the prudent men-philosophres and other about the firmament til it was
day that they saw the son show and rise in the morning read and clear
which ascended and mounted half the day / And that other half descended so
long til he went under which made the night tapproche / And then came again
the sterres in the night in their course til the son came again and enlumyned
the day / and held his way and course til that he repaired on the morn in to
his pryncypal place / After they beheld the moon / which was a comune thing
and appeared to the world dyuersely / One time she was round / another time
half / and after horned / and so went and becam such as noman might see her /
And after she appeared horned and sith half as she had been to fore / and also
round and full / Then knew they well by their entendeme^t that she approached
the son til she was even against him / and after departed / And after she
withdrew her more and more til that she was under the son as she had been to
fore / And then she went and came again every night and day tornyng and
making her course a about the firmament / right as she now does with out any
thing changyng the contrary / But now as said is the people that been now think
more / And ben much more curyous of their great and fat paunches for to
fylle / and to make them fat / by which they come the so^ner to their end
and to carayn^ and by their ouermoche nourisshyng and vylaynous / which
delyuereth them first to trauaylle and after to shame and dampnacion / The
ancient faders governed them not in this wise / ffor they setted not of mete
and drink / but for talegge their hungre and thirst for to sustain their
bodies and to hold hem in health in such wise as they might help them self
by their wits / as they ought to do for to come to the glory of our lord /
And that time they lived xx or xxx year longer than they do now of an honderd
one / And that proceeds of their folissh and outrageous governance /
Certainly such people understand not well the word of our lord when he said to
the devil when he came to tempte him and said that he should make of the stones
bread and that he should ete / Then Ihesu Christ answered / that man lived not
only by bread / but by the word that proceeds fro the mouth of god / if the
men in thise days understood well this word / they would reteyne more gladly
the doctrynes that proceed and come fro the mouth of our creator and maker /
But the great rentes that they have / and the great tresours of their coffres
be^ cause of shortyng and abreggyng of their days / by their disordinat
mangeries that ouermoche noye and grieve them / so that nature may not well bear
ne sustain / whereof they must needs the so^ner render their soul and dye /
Thus their Rentes / their tresours or other thing wherein they delight them /
take away their life / their heart / and their wit all attones / In such
wise that when death comes and must needs dye / they have lost wit and
understanding / of whom many ben deed and dampened / which at their need may
not be counseilled ne can not help them self when they have most need / They
live not like them / that for to keep them fro peryllis studied in sciences and
used their life in such manner that they would but sustain their body only as
long as they should be in this world / as they that well knew that this life
should not to them long endure / And had envy at none other thing / but only
for to learn such science by which they might know the souerayn king
allmyghty that all had created of naught and made it with his hand / Then
they thought in their entendeme^t as people that was of noble and virtuous
entenco^n / that they should neu have knowleche of our lord god / ne of so hye
might but if they intended and serched in his works which they fond so
excellent / and as great as they might enquere and know / ffor men shall never
well know the maistre / but if before men know parfightly his estate and what
his works been / ffor by the werkys is the werkeman known / And how he may be
such one / And therefore the ancient faders would employe them and assaye the
werkis of our lord / And first for to have knowleche of his power and his
virtue / Considering that they might not ocupye them self in a more digne ne
worthy science ne more diffycile / And when the more that they knew of his
werkis and of his wisdom / somoche more had they the better will to love her
creator and maker / and to honor him / considering that he had made so noble
a thing and so worthy as is the heaven in which ben the sterres that shine
bright therein / and his other meruayllous virtues which they preysed much /
ffor how much more they preysed him / somoche with good will they served him
/ ffor it was all their affeccion / jntencion and reason to know god / ffor as
much as they knew certainly / that god had given to them with nature wit
and raison for to search and compryse of things of therthe / and of them of
heaven as much as they might know / ffor otherwise they might never have
thought it / Thus a man be he never so wise ne discrete / may never come for to
understand the hye secrets of god ne of his miracles / but by him ffor by
right he knows all / But of them that by nature be made and ordained in heaven
and in earth / man may well enquere sum resouns if it be given him and that he
be garnysshid of good quyk wit / And that he have set and employed his time
to study and to learn / And since they had gotten understanding and raison by
their great estudye labor and trauayll / somoche that they might comprise
wherefore and how all the world was made and compassed as ye have herd here to
fore / So thought they then / that they might well know and have reason of
sum things / since they had the understanding of him that is almighty to
know in party or at lest of such as they might see with their eyes / how
well that they were far / Thus would they know the reason of that / that they
saw so meue the sterres of the firmament and of them that shone so clear /
Certainly this was the pryncipal cause why first they put them to study for
tenquere the science that they knew not / And knew well that they should
enquere sonner of things that they saw / than of them that they saw not /
And therefore were they meuyd for to know and tenquere the science which they
knew not of that they had often seen the firmament to meue / and would know
the truth / And said it was right good to know it / if it pleasid god / and
to know of his naturel werkis / ffor the more parfightly to bileue and know
how he was god all mighty / ffor men could not know ne find no resons of god
but only by his werkis / The good Ancient wise men / wiche diligently would
understand this matter / had no cure for to amasse none other goods / but
only to learn the pure science / they were nothing covetous / ne set not to
gadre tresours / And there were plente of them that apperceyued as wise men that
it was a great charge to them oftymes as well to keep it / as to spend it by
mesure as in other ways to get it and bring it to gedre / And that all this
was a letting to them for to learn / And they deliberid among them and
concluded / that sum cast and threw their tresour in to the sea / The other
gaf it away and abandonned to them that would take it / and went as hermytes /
And the other departed it to pour people / And other there were that left their
good in such wise as them seemed that they should have less cause to think
thereon / and retained nothing but only for their use / And held with hem
certain folk to serve them to the end only / that they should entende to nothing
but to study and to learn / They did do edefye their houses fro the people
like as religious people and set them in such places that thries or four
times the weke they might assemble and come to gydre for to solace them and
sport / And there each rendered his reason of that he had found and learned /
And so long did they thus til they had experimented which was true / and
who knew most and that they had founden who had most grettest entendement /
And him they chose by consent of them all for maistre / And he recorded their
resons heeryng all the felawys / and reherced to them all to gydre that every
man had said / In this manner were the clergies first founden contryued and
auau^ced / And somoche trauaylled and studied that they knew by the help of
our lord of whom all science grows and haboundeth great party of that it is
/ But this was not in little time / ffor they were long in study and
understood much / And they that were first / all that they understood and
knew / they put it in writing the best wise they could / to the^nde that they
that should come after them / and would entremete in connyng / might have their
wrytyngis and trauaylle always in the science as they had don before All that
they fond and saw / they set in compilacions And did so much each in hi
styme that they were more than.ij.M. and.CCCC. year er they by their labors
and continuel studyes had gotten the vij Arts or sciences liberal and put to
gydre / But they held their labor well employed and the pain that they put
thereto / ffor they knew by their wit and by their clergy / all that was
come on earth by nature / when they would set their cure thereon And also were
not abashed when a merueyllous caas happed on heaven or on earth / ffor they
could well enquere the reason wherefore it was / and since that it happed by nature
/ And so loved god much the more / when they saw such meruayllous werkis /
And watched many nyghtes with right great joye and great study of this that
they saw and fond so hye works / by which they amended them self against our
lord that they knew truth / and left the vanyte of this world / that so
litil is worth for to come to the joye that never shall faylle / Of whom plente
of wise philosophres that were in the world deyde wrongfully and without reason
/ by cause they shewde rightfully to the great lords / and gaf them fair
examples / in repreuyng and myspreysing their evil tyrannyes and thextorsiouns
that they did to much people / And preched to them right and truth / And
they that would not bileue them / and had shame of that they were of them blamed
/ they made them to be put in their prisons / where they made them to deye by
grievous tourmentes / by cause they showed to them the troth whereof they were
certain / like as was don to holy saints that suffered death and passion for the
love of ihesu christ whom they would enhaunse So were there such philosophres
that by their wit and understanding prephecyed the holy time of the coming of
ihesu christ like as virgyle said which was in the time of Cezar at Rome / by
which plente of people have been better sith / than they were before / ffor he
said that a new lignage was enjoyed fro heaven on hygh^ that should do /
virtues in earth by whom the devil should be overcome / upon which saint poul
that saw this escripture / which he much preysed / said with a sorouful
heart for so moch^ as he had not ben christian / ha that j should have rendered and
yelden the to god / if thou had lived / and that j had come to the / Other
philosophres there were of whom euerich said good words and meruayllous / But
we may not now reherce all the good things that they said / ffor they were
prudent all and valyant / seen that they set to fore all other things
clergy / ffor if it were not by clergy / men should not know that god were /
And if they had not ben so prudent men as they were / there had never be so
great clergy as is now / And if there were now such as they were then that
fond first clergy / it should be other wise than it now is / But clergy goth
now al to naught / that almost it is perisshid / ffor in thise days the people
secth not by cause that they that ought wnderstande virtues and to teache other
and enscyne and give example to do well / they ben they that recule and
withdraw fro it And all this proceeds by their folly / ffor noma^ holds
clergy for virtue / ne he loves it not ne applies it in all points / But
many there ben that sechen the lies and drestis / and leave the clear wyn^ / ffor
noman lerneth ne secheth now / but for to conne so much that he might conquer
and get the money / And when they have gotten and largely assemblid thereof /
then ben they werse than they were a fore / ffor the money has so surprysed
them that they may entende to none other thing / There ben plente of pour
clerks that gladly would learn if they had the power But they may not entende
thereto / by cause they have not whereof for to furnisshe them of their
necessitees as well for to have books as m^te. drink and clothes / But ben
constrained for to get their living other wise / ffor the rich have now in
thise days seized somoche / that the pour abide naked and must suffer / yet
ben there plente of Rich clerkis that have books without nombre of one and
other richely adoubed and couerd to the end that they ben holden for wise and
good clerks / ffor they seche to have no more / buf only the loos and preysing
of the people / And do in like wise as the Cock that shrapeth in the duste for
to find pasture / he shrapeth so long in the duste and mulle til he find a
gemme rich and precious which shyneth clear / then he begins to look
thereon and beholds it / and does no more but late it lie / ffor he demands
not after the ouche or gemme / but had leuir have sum corn to ete / In like
wise is it of many of thise not wise clerkis covetous that have the precious
books richely lymined storyed and well adoubed / that do nothing but look and
behold them without forth while they be new by cause them seem that they ben
fair / and so they behold them gladly and pass therewith / and after they
torn on that other side and think for to fylle their belyes / and to come to
their folyssh desires / And they might learn enough if they would entende it /
ffor they have well the power / and might do as the wise men did herto fore /
the which by their trauayl. study and diligence fond first the clergyes /
but they have their entendement folissh and out of the way / And therefore the
sciences and arts perisshe in such wise that uneath and with great pain
know they their parts of reason which is the first book of gramaire / the
which is the first of the seven sciences But put their arte^ in their males /
and goo learn anon the laws or decretals / and become advocates and iuristes
for to amasse and gadre always money wherein the devil conforteth hem / and yet
do they not somoche for to learn / as they do for to fylle their purses / In
paris Oxenford and Cambrige is there such manner of clerks that been acustomed
to will have the Renomme and fame to be called maistres for to be the more
preysed and honored / And have lever to conne lytil and to have the name of
maistre / than they should be good clerks without having the degree and name of
maistre / But they be called maistres wrongfully / ffor vanyte maistryeth them
in such wise that they can but lytil truth / because that they have so soon
the name of maistre they leave the clergy / And take them to the wynnyng / like
as merchants do and brokers / And in this wise ben many in the world that have
the name of maistre / that know right lytil of good and reason / ffor they that
now desire this ben not maistres after right / ffor they ordeyne them otherwise
to the sciences / than they did that fond them first / They entered first in
to gramayre for to draw reason in their ordinance / And after logyque for to
preue and show the troth fro the false / After they fond rethoryque for to
speak fair in judgment and right which they much loved / and after
arsmetryque for to be expert in all things / after they fond geometry for
to mesure and compass all maistrye / and after they fond the science of
musyque for to set all things in concordau^ce / after they had the
understanding of astronomye / ffor thereby were they meuid to have science and
virtue / In this manner ye may understand how they that first fond science /
ordained the vij arts or vij sciences / and they ben in such wise entrelaced
that they may not be auctorised that one without that other ne entierly preysed
/ and also the first may not be perfightly co^ned without the last / ne the
last without the first / and he that will learn one a right and understand
it / him behooves to learn all the other / ffor otherwise may not be known
appertly the certain / ne the incertayn / ffor that one is so comune to that
other that it behooves to know of all / but now men seche to learn no more but
the art for to get y^ money / and ben to blame of that the other were
preysed that first so trauaylled of which it is to us so great need / ffor
litil should we have known if we had not seen it by writing / ffor as it is
tofore said / if clergy had be lost / we had known nothing ne who had be god
Ne men should never have known / what thing had been best to do / and so should
all the world have been dampened / then had we ben born in an evil hour /
ffor the men had known no more than do dombe beestis / and all the good
things ben now known and all comen of the vij sciences that the philosophres
fond sometime by their wits / ffor thereby had they understanding to love god
and his virtues And that god is always and shall be withouten end / and so
bileued they in great faith truly in the au^cyent law / But in thise days the
sciences perisshe by our enuyes detracco^ns and other euylles in such wise
that right lityl is retained of one and other / ffor now dar no man entende but
for richesse / ffor myssayers felons and enuyous men that will learn no good /
and if they see any entende to sciences and clergyes / and they be not rich
and mighty for to furnysse hem / the Rich men will anon scorn and mocque them
/ and thus will the devil exhort them that is their master and their lord and
to whom it pleseth that they messaye in so much as he shall reward them with
great hyre that they shall be sure to have all evil adue^tures in hell that
stynketh where they shall mock them self and shall say that they were born in
an evil hour / when they have not learned that they ought to learn There shall
they have more prouffyt of their sciences / that loved better to co^quere
clergy / than the fool to conne know to assemble the great tresours and the
great richesses / and know ye that all they that for to get worldly goods
left their time for to learn good / ben all assured to have evil and pain
after their death / ffor by their avarice and cheuau^ce the sciences come to
naught / so that almost they be perisshyd / and that / which now is known /
comes and grows of the vnyusitees of paris oxenford and cambrige and other
etc

Of three manner of people and how clergy came first into the Royamme of france.
capitulo vio
NOw regneth clergy much strongly in ffrau^ce in the cite of paris as sometime
was in the cite of athenes which then was much noble and puissau^t / The
philosophres that then were / and which that ought to teache and learn other
/ acompted but three manner of people in the world after their understanding / and
that were clerks. knights. and laborers / The laborers ought to pourueye
for the clerks and knights such things as were nedeful for them to live by
in the world honestly / and the knights ought to defend the clerkis / and the
laborers that there were no wrong don to them / and the clerkis ought to
enseigne and teache these ij manner of people / and to adresse them in their
werkis in such wise that none do thing by which he should displese god ne
lose his grace Thus setted sometime the wise philosophres three manner of people in
the world / As they that knew / that no man might set his courage in that he
might be wise a right in ij manners or three / ffor it happed never day of the
world that clergy cheualrye and laborers of therthe might be well known by
one only man in all his life ne learned ne retained / therefore he that would
learn byhoueth him only to learn one of the three / and therefore the
philosophres set three manner of people without moo in the earth / ffor they
would seche the very truth / And sought acyte in the world / where they might
best be and dwell for tenquere thestate of the clergy / and thus the better
for tadresse them / and to teache other / they chees the cite of athenes which
was noble and sometime one where they had their common residence and assemblee
And there reigned first chyualrye with clergy / and after fro thens it went to
Rome / which now is of great Reno^mee / And there cheualrye continued long /
And frothens after it remeuid in to ffrau^ce / where chyualrye has more power
than any other place in the world / And thus habou^deth there that one and that
other ffor cheualrye sieweth always clergy where she goth Then the king of
ffraunce and of England may be joyous that there is in his Roya^mes such
seignourye as is science of clergy where every man may draw out wit and
connyng humayn / and there abides never the less / ffor it is as a fontayn
that contynuelly sourdeth and spryngeth And the more it renneth and the ferther
/ the more it is holsom / and how more the spring of the fontayn renneth and
ferther somoche is the more of the water / and the more may be taken fro it for
need / In like wise may I say to you / that paris Oxenford and Cambryge ben
the fontayns where men may draw out most science and more in paris than in
other places / and since it is so that clergy is somoche auaunced in ffrau^ce
/ Then ought we know by reason in especyal if the heirs of france daigne to
conne it / ffor like as the son is most fair of all the sterres And causes
most good things to grow in the world / by the bounte that habou^deth in him
/ so ought the king be of more valewe than any other / and to have more
understanding and clergy / so that by his valyaunce and suffysaunce he might
shine emonge other people / and by thexe^ple of his well doing that they see in
him / they might by right conduyte draw them to our lord and in such wise
should he be king by right in this world and in heaven / so then should it be
well right and raison / yt they do their diligence to learn such clergy and
science / that after this mortal life they lose not the seignourye of heaven /
ffor by nature and lignage ought they all to love clergy and always to learn
it Certes the emperor of almaygne louid with all his heart clergy / And auanced
it to his power in ffraunce / And all the good clerkis that he could find he
retained them to his court / and sent for them oueral where he knew any / he
had in his time many a trauayll / many a pain / and many a dan^gier and ennoye
for to mayntene and enhaunce christian faith / And therefore he never left / but
held the clerks in right great reverence / ffor gladly he learned always as is
founden by his deeds / he was a good Astronomyer / And was much louid in
lorayn / ffor gladly he dwellid there / And yet ben there many of his iewellis
fair and rich that he gaf unto chirches as a good blessid man as he was /
Truly he louid god above all other thing / and did much dyligence in his
time for to bring the sciences and the clergy in to france / and yet they
abide there and regne by his prowess / And has much taught and given
ensample to kings that come after him / ffor evermore he has in paris
co^querd science and clergy / Now then almighty god hold it / and that it
may in the cite be. always mayntened ffor if the study went out of ffrau^ce /
knyghthode would goo after / as it has always don / ffor contynuelly that one is
by that other / Therefore late the king of ffraunce for his weel / reteyne it if
he may / ffor he may well lose his Royamme / if clergy depart out of ffraunce
/ Also there ben in ffrau^ce an other people which ben late come / and they ben
ffreris mynours and iacobyns / which have take on them relygion for the love
of god for to learn and entende to serve god / of whom our lord has don to us
so great honor and Reverence that they reteyne all the flour of clergy in
their ordres for tadresse and enhaunce our mother holy church by their estudye
and trauaylle / ffor they have good will for to serve our lord and to learn
sciences and the holy scripture / as they that have given over the world and
habandonned / And me seems that they do as did they that setted them by
hynde the hutyns in their cloister under the people for the better to get the
merit of heaven in leuyng worldly possessions / And our lord has don great
bounte to them that have them in their cytees in their castles and towns /
ffor they serve not for tricherye and barat / but trauaylle in prechyng and
making sermones for to bring the people to good life and to the way of truth
/ And oftymes suffer great disease for to bring other in ease / ffor I bileue
well that if ne were their bou^te and good prechynge and techyng / Cristente
should be exyled by error and evil believe / if they hold hem and keep that
they have emprised as they that have leyd down under them all the richesses of
the world / without retornyng again thereto / then have they a much good
manner / ffor they have taken on them for the love of our lord the life of
pouerte / and plente of other that be in the world don in like wise that take
ensample at them that see that they weel do Therefore ought we to give
thankynges to god / and adresse our hertes to do well / in such wise that by
right we might goo to the joye of heaven by our good deedis / of which god give
us might to deserve that thereof we may be partoners / but for as much as ye
have herd reherce how the vij arts or sciences liberal were found and by
whom / I pass and deporte but will reherce what they be and wherefore they
serve / ffor fro them proceeds sens or wit humayn / and all manner work /
that is made with hondes / All prowesses / and all habilitees / all goods
and all humylitees And therefore I will descriue in matter and substance
couenable the virtues of each of them / and whereof they proceed particulerly
and of their nature / And after we shall speak of the world / and how it is
composed all round But before all other works we shall speak of the vij
sciences which ought not to be forgeten / And first we shall touch of the
science or art of gramaire / which is the first of the seven / And without
whom the other six may have no perfeccion /

Gramaire capitulo vijo
The first of the.vij. sciences is gramaire / of which for the time that is
now / is not known the fourth perte / without which science / fikerly all
other sciences in especial ben of lytil recommendacion / by cause without
gramaire there may none prouffyte / ffor gramaire is the fondement and the
beginning of clergy / And it is the yate by the which in thenfancye is
bygonne and in contynnyng men come and atteyne to sapye^ce of clergy / This is
the science to form the speech be it in latin ffrenshe or englisshe / or in
any other langage that men speak with / And who that could all gramaire / he
could make and construe every word / And pronounce it by example / god made
the world by word / And the word is to the world sentence /

here foloweh of logyke capitulo viijo
THe second science is logyke which is called dyaletyque / This science
proves the. pro. and the. contra. / That is to say the verite or truth /
and otherwise / And it preueth whereby shall be known the true fro the false /
and the good fro the evil / So verily that for the good was created heaven and
maad / And on the contrary wise for the evil was hell maad and establisshyd
which is horrible stynkyng and redoubtable /

Hier speaks of Rethoryque capitulo ixo
THe therde of the vij sciences is called Rethoryque which conteyneth in
substance / rightwisnes. Rayson and ordinance of words / And ought not to be
holden for folly / ffor the dedytes and laws by which the iugements be made
and that by rayson and after right ben kept and mayntened in ye court of kings
of princes and of barons come and proceed of Rethoryque / Of this science were
extrayt and drawn the laws and decrees which by need serve in all causes /
and in all rightes and droytes / who well knew the science of Rethoryque / he
should know the right and the wrong / ffor to do wrong to another who so
does it / is lost and dampened / and for to do right and reason to every man /
he is saved and geteth the love of god his creator /

Here follows Arsmetryque and whereof it proceeds. ca. xo
The fourth scye^ce is called arsmetrique / this science comes after
rethoryque / ande is set in the myddle of the. vij sciences / And without her
may none of the vij sciences parfyghtly ne weel and entierly be known /
wherefore it is expedyent that it be weel known and ^onned / ffor all the
sciences take of it their substance in such wise that without her they may
not be / And for this reason was she set in the myddle of the vij sciences /
and there holds her nombre / ffor fro her proceed all manners of nombres /
and in all things run come and goo / And no thing is without nombre / But
few perceive how this may be / but if he have be maistre of the.vij arts so
long that. he can truly say the truth / But we may not now recompte ne
declare all the causes wherefore ffor who that would dispute upon such works
/ him behooved despute and know many things and much of the gloss who that
knew well the science of arsmetrique he might see thordynance of all things /
By ordynance was the world made and created / And by ordynance of the souerayn
it shall be deffeted /

Next follows the science of Geometrye capitulo xio.
The fyfthe is called geometrye the which more auaylleth to Astronomye than
any of the vij other / ffor by her is compassed and mesured Astronomye Thus is
by geometrye mesured all thingis / where there is mesure by geometrye / may be
known ye course of the sterres which alleway go and meue / And the gretenes of
the firmament of the son of the moon and of the earth / By geometrye may be
known all things and also the qua^tyte They may not be so far if they may
be seen or espied with eye but it may be known / who well understood geometry
/ he might mesure in all maistryes / ffor by mesure was the world made / and
all things hye. low and deep /

Here follows of musyque / capi-
The sixthe of the vij sciences is called musyque / the which fourmeth him of
Arsmetryque / Of this science of musyque comes all attemperaunce / And of
this art proceeds sum phisyque / ffor like as musyque acco^deth all
things that dyscorde in them / and remain them to concordaunce / right so in
like wise trauaylleth phisyque to bring Nature to point that disnatureth in
man's body / when any maladye or sekenes encombreth hit / But phisyque is not
of the nombre of the vij sciences of philosophye / But it is a mestier or a
craft that entendeth to the health of man's body / and for to preserve it fro
all maladyes and sekenesses as long as the life is in the body / And therefore
it is not liberal / ffor it serves to hele man's body / which ellis
oftentimes might lightly perysshe / and there is nothing liberal ne free that
grows of therthe And for as much as science that serves to man's body
leseth his franchise / but science that serves to the soul deserves in the
world to have name liberal / ffor the soul ought to be liberal as thing that
is of noble being / as she that comes of god / and to god will and ought
return / and therefore ben the vij sciences liberal / ffor they make the soul
all free And on that other part / they teache and enseygne all that in every
thing ought proprely to be don And this is the very reason why thise arts all
vij ben called vij sciences liberal / ffor they make the soul liberal / and
deliver it fro all evil / Of this art is musyque thus comune / that she
acordeth her to euerich so well that by her the vij sciences were set in
concord that they yet endure / By this science of musyque ben extrayt and
drawn all the songs that been songen in holy church / and all the
accordaunces of all the instruments that have diverse accordes and diverse
sownes / and where there is reason and entendement of sum things / Certes who
can well the science of musyque / he knows the accordance of all things /
And all the creatures that pain them to do well / remain them to concordance
/

Hier speaks of Astronomye capitulo xiijo
The vij and the last of the vij scyences liberal is astronomye / which is of
all clergy the end By this science may and ought to be inquired of things
of heaven and of therthe / and in especyal of them that been made by nature / how
far that they be / And who knows well and understands astronomye / he can
set reason in all things / ffor our creator made all things by reason and
gaf his name to every thing / By this Art and science were first emprysed and
gotten all other sciences of decrees and of dyuinyte / by which all
Cristiante is converted to the right faith of our lord god to love him / and to
serve the king almighty / ffro whom all goods come and to whom they return
/ which made all astronomye And heaven and earth. the son. the moon and the
sterres / as he that is the very rewler and governor of all the world / and
he that is the very reffuge of all creatures / ffor without his playsir
nothing may endure / Certes he is the very Astronomyer / ffor he knows all /
the good and the badde as he him self that composed astronomye / that sometime
was so strongly frequented / and was holden for alright hye work / ffor it is
a science of so noble being / that who that might have the parfayt science
thereof / he might well know how the world was compassed and plente of other
parcyal sciences / ffor it is the science above all other by which all manner
of things ben known the better / By the science of Astronomye only / were
founden all the other.vj. to fore named / And without them may none know a
right Astronomye / be he never so sage ne mighty / In like wise as an hamer or
an other tool of a mason ben the instruments by which he forms his work /
And by which he does his craft / In like wise by right maistrye ben the other
/ the instruments and fondements of Astronomye / And the ancient wisemen as
kings. princes. dukes. earls. knights. and other great lords / by their
understanding. great trauayll. estudye. and by the hye conduyte that was in
them set by good manner all their pain and labor to learn and know the
sciences and arts of clergy for to understand the science of astronomye / And
so long they trauaylled that by the will of our lord they learned and knew
enough ffor they knew plente of great affairs and works that happened in the
world And they preysed nothing tho things that were erthely / as they that
knew well the resons thereof / And that time was the customme that if a man were
bond / to one or moo / or if he were comen of lytyl extraccion / and were
rich and full of great goods / yet durst he not estudye in the vij sciences
liberal / for the nobles and hye men that in all points would reteyn^ them
princypal / and to the end that they were free and liberal / And by this reason
they put thereto for name the vij arts or sciences liberal / ffor they ben so
free / that they render to god the soul all free / And they ben so well to
point / that there may nothing be taken away / ne nothing put to / how well if
any would or could meddle therwyth thaugh he were a good clerk and expert /
ffor if they were turned or changed any thing that might be / all should be
disfygured / by cause they ben so resonably and truly composed / that there is
noman living in the world / be he never of so much and perfou^de science / be
he paynem Jew or Christian / that may any thing or can change / torn / ne take
away ne defowle it in any manner / And who that parfyghtly knew the vij arts /
he should be byleuid in all laws / ffor there is noman that could interrupte
him of any thing that he would preue / were it true or otherwise / by cause he
should preue by quyck reason all that he would were it wrong or right / Then
is he a fool that thinks to know perfyghtly any thing that apperteyneth to
clergy / By what mystere or craft that may come to him / but if it be by
miracle of god that all may do / if he can none of the vij sciences / ffor
otherwise all his trauaylle should be of no valewe ne he should not conne show
thing of Recommendacion ne preue by right the pro and contra / Therefore the
vij sciences ben byleued in all the laws / there as they ben red / And there
is noman be he never of so diverse a law ne of so diverse langage that if he
converse with people that can nothing of the vij sciences ne preue of their
vsages ne of their parts that shall be bileuid for expert and wise / Ne there
shall never be paynem ne sarrasyn so much diverse / that a Christian man or a
Jew may withsaye him of things that he will alegge or preue / And the
decretals ne the laws be not evil / thaugh sum people hold evil the
constitucions that been emonge them / because that other do them and holden /
ffor all the laws depend of the vij sciences / and all men believe them and
reteyne them / there where as people know them And all resons that proceed of
the vij sciences ben true in all causes and in all places / Thus ben not the
sciences mu^ble / but alleway ben estable and true Herwith I deporte me to
speak more to you hereof / ffor there is enough here of tofore made ample mention
/ And now I shall reherce to you here after of thaccidentes and of the faites of
nature and that shall be short / ffor god created nature altherfirst / and
tofore he created any other thing that apperteyned to the world And we ought
to fore all other work say and declare what she is / for to deuyse after and
descryue of the world / ffor the firmament torneth and meueth by nature / and
in like wise do all the things that have meuyng / Nature meueth the sterres
and makes them to shine and grow / and also may anoye and grieve as much as
she will And by cause all men understand not well what this follows in
substance / we shall declare a litil our matere a long / ffor to give the
better understanding what nature is / and how she werketh to the end that more
fully ye may compryse the facion of the world by this that herafter shall be to
you declared / if ye will well understand the resons / And therefore give y^
dy^^gence for to comprise them and well to reteyne them /

Here follows of Nature how she werketh and what she is capitulo xiiijo
OVre lord god created alther first nature / ffor she is the thing by which
all creatures and other works have dured and live what someuer they be
ordained of god under the heaven / without nature may nothing grow / and by
her have all things created life / and therefore behooves nature to be first /
ffor she noryssheth and entertieneth all creatures / and habandonneth her self
where it pleseth the creator or maker / Nature werkyth in like wise when she is
employed / as does the axe of a carpenter / when he employeth it in his work /
ffor the axe does nothing but cut / And he that holds it addressith it to
what part he will / so that in the end by the axe the work is achieuid and
made after thentente of the werker / right so nature makes ready and
habandonneth where as god will / ffor all things ben made by her / and
entiertiened as god will make them / and she werketh after this in such
manner / that if she lack on one side / she recouerith it on that other /
nature fourmeth nothing in vayn / But she werketh in such manner that she
takes away fro nothing his plain / ffor her work is always hool after that she
fyndeth matere / be it in persons or in bestes / Then ben her works above
all other to be recomended as she that does nothing that in any wise may be
contrary to god / but where as matter lacketh^ she leueth to work / and
alleway somoche there is more of matter / somoche more she werketh / As men see
of sum beestis / of which so^me have two heedes and vj feet / or it has a
membre less than he ought to have / of which he abides without very form
naturell / and may be called therefore a mo^stre / also men see otherwhile so^me
that almost lack all / and other that have plente and habondaunce in their
faites / All in like wise falls often and is seen happen upon sum men the
which when they ben born / they have vj fyngres on one hand / And other that
have one or ij or iij less than they should have / or them lacks an hole
memb^^ / by which they be of less valewe of that that apperteyneth to the
world / and in an other shall be so great habundaunce of nature or matere in
body or in membre that he has other thing than form humayn sets / ffor
him lacks a foot or a hand / Or he shall be born sometime more or less / or
he shall have a leg more longer / or shorter or an arm / than the other / yet
there is another thing which ought not to be forgoten / ffor that one shall be
born black or broun / and that other white / one great / and another lytil /
that one shall happen to be wise and discrete / and that other folissh or
shrewyssh^ / so^me be wise and sad in their yongthe / and in their age ben
often folissh / so^me be foles young and old / And other ben wise all their
live young and old / so^me be fat / and so^me be lene / sum be seek and
so^me ben hool so^me be sklendre / and so^me be thyck / so^me be hard and rude
/ and so^me be soft and tender / so^me be slow and so^me be hasty / so^me be
hardy / and so^me be cowardis / so^me be lame. haltyng and crooked / so^me ben
well fourmed in all rightis and points / A great man i^ often evil made / And a
lytil man is often well made and auenaunt / ffor there is no membre but it be well
made and apperteynyng to his body / A fair child oftymes in his growyng
becomes fowl / Sum will have their wills / and other desire it but lytyl /
euerich has his talente and his appetyte A ^itil man engenders often a great
man / and a great man often getyth a lytil one / a litil man otherwhile
empriseth to do a great thing / that right a great man will not emprise / Sum
deye lightly / and other lie long / and sum live aslonge til age make them
to give over the world / after that / that nature endures to them by the will
of god Also it is seen often emonge men that sum entende to clergy / and
other give them to other style of science and craft / as of carpenter mason
smyth or any other craft in which he employeth his time / ffor e^y man gives
him self gladly to that / which his entendement is enclyned to / and to other
craft or science than nature and understanding gives him to / he shall never
perfightly understood / ne so well meddle with all as he should to that which
his p^opre nature gives him to / there ben yet other manner of people that set
and give them self to do many things yt other may not n^ can not do / for
asmoche as their nature has not given it to them / ffor so^me prete^de to hye
estates and great richesses / and other ben content with lytil estate / and it
happeth often that a man comes to that / where he prete^deth / and other can
not come thereto / but torneth contrary to them and to their dommage / and often
with great pain may they come to their above / of yt thing yt they would
acco^plysshe / and other do and make plente of things / that so^me can not ne
may not do ne make / ffor in the persons ben so many dy^setees / and facions
not like and of wills / that men shall not find in any contree of the world
two men that parfyghtly be like / who far they can seche / but that they be
diverse in sum caas / or of body or of members or of entendement or of the
visage or of their sayengis or of their faytes or deeds / ffor the puissaunce
of nature is so diverse / that there is nothing that has growyng but that she
has upon it might / in such wise that she gives to one sum thing that
another has not in him / how be it that noman can perceive any distaunce /
Such is the virtue of Nature where plente of clerks have sometime set their
entendeme^t and cure and have strongly labored to the end that they might
better declare the fayte and puissaunce of nature / And first of all says
Plato which was a man of great renommce / that nature is an over puissaunce or
might in things that she makes to grow like by like after that / that
euerych may be / And this may be understood by one man that engenders
another / and by bestes by plants and by seeds the which after their
semblaunces grow and after their facion / And lo this is that / that the wise
platon says which was a great clerk / After him says Aristotle / that this
was a yefte come fro the hye prince / when he gaf virtue to the firmament and to
the sterres for to m^ue and to be / and that without god such power ne might
not be given / as the things that have power to remeue to be and to meue /
Aristotle that says this / studied in many a book treatyng of nature / Many
other philosophres there were / that said that nature proceeded of virtues of
hete which causes all things to grow and nourisshe / But for this present
time I pass over for to speak of other matere Tho philosophres ensieweth
better plato than Aristotle / Thus said they that them seems / And they spack
so hye like as before is said / that few clerks might atteyne to come thereto /
and for to abregge it / he is not that might parfyghtly know what it is / sauf
god that all knows and that all sees / and that first would establisshe for
taccomplyssh^ all things / herby may well be known that god is of much great
puissaunce / And it is of him a right great thing when he of naught and
without trauayll created and fourmed so excellent a thing and so hye and noble
awerke And therefore would he him self create and make man to the end that he
might be so mighty and have such wit and understanding in him self that he
knew by nature that which might grieve him in his soul / and live unto our
lord / ffor if he will justly and rightfully conduyte him self / he may well
bring his heart to that / that nature shall not mow grieve him in no manner /
and therefore were founden the vij sciences or arts / for to take away the evil
thoughts that might bring a man to the death / which they may destroy by
the sciences / And thus may one change his ^uyl estate / by the techynges of a
good maistre / and therefore it is good for to haunte emonge the virtuous men /
ffor there men may learn and prouffyte in diverse manners / Thus then is he
wise that is prudent in such manner that after his death he has the better /
and that god receives him in gree Thus than he shall have done more for his
owen prouffyt than for an other / This know all men certainly / ffor he shall
resseyue all the weel / And much is he a fool that somoche louyth his body
that he forgeteth to save his soul / which god has lent to him pure and
clean to the end that he should render it such again at his death / and that he
govern him not in such wise that by his culpe and defawte defowle him in
sins / he that so conduyteth him self / does in like wise as the evil
servant did / to whom the maistre delyuerd his besauntes for to multeplye in
good / but he did not justly as he that was of evil faith / wherefore the
maistre seeing the untruth of him chaced him away fro him / And ever after he
had shame and reproach like as the gospel witnesses and to us reherceth All
in like wise shall it be of them that leave the good grayn for the chaff / these
ben they that suffer their sowles to perisshe for the playsance of their bodies
/ of which all euylles come to them / herwith for this present I leave the
declaracion of the vij sciences and of nature / and purpose by the grace of god
to deuyse the facion of the world how it is by nature made and pourtrayed of
god / which of one only will created and fourmed the world and all that is
thereof apendau^t / Now entende ye to this that we say to you /

Of the form of the firmament capitulo xvo
GOd fourmed the world all round. like as is a pelette / the which is al
round / and he made the heaven al round which enuyronneth and goth round
about the earth on all parties holy without any defaulte / all in like wise
as the shelle of an egg that enuyronneth the white al about / And so the
heaven goth round about an air / which is above thayer the which in latin is
called hester / this is as much to say as pure air and clean / ffor it was
made of pure and of clear purete / This air shyneth night and day of
resplenduer perpetuel / and is so clear and shynyng / that if a man were
abydyng in that part / he should see all / one thing and other And all that
is fro on end to the other also lightly or more / as a man should do here
bynethe upon the earth the only length of a foot or less yet if he had need /
All in like wise I say to you / who that were there / he might see al about
him as well far as nygh^e / the air is so clear and net / Of this hester
thangels taken their bodies and their wings / when our lord god sends them
in message hither low in to therthe to his friends / when he will show to
them any thing / And therefore seem they to be so clear to synful men in this
world / that their eyes may not suffer the resplendour ne behold the great
clerenes / as they that been full of obscurte and derknes / that is to say of
sins and of inyquytees of which they ben replenesshid And it happeth oftymes
/ that when thangels ben comen to any man in any place by the will of god for
to say and show their message / that whiles thangele speaks to him He
falls to ground as he were a sleep or in a trance / And him seems he
hereth not the word of thangele but as he dremed / And is muct without spekyng
/ unto the time that thangele repaired again / Then when he was awaked / and
comen again to him self / he remembrid well the saying of thangele / and what he
had showed to him / Thus I say you for truth that no bodyly man / may not
sustain for to see him in no manner / for so much as a man is made of heavy
matere Ne no bird ne foul be he never so strong ne so well fleyng may not
suffer to be there / but that him behooves to come down as soon as a stone /
till that he come in to thayer where he may repryse his fleyng / if he were not
abasshid to descend / ffor there may nothing abide / but if it be thing
espirituel^ / ne may not live there / ffor no more than the ffysshe may live in
this air where we ben in / ne sustain him / but right soon must dye / and
shortly perisshe / but if he be contynuelly nourisshid in the water / All in
like wise I say you of us / ffor we may not meue in this air perpetuel ne live
ne dwell there as long as we have the body mortal /

How the four Elements ben set capitulo xvio
THis clerenesse of which we have spoken / which is called air spyrituel /
And where the angels take their array and atourement enuyronneth al about the
world / the four elementis which god created and set that one with in that
other / Of which that one is the ffyre / The second is thayer / The therde is
the water / And the fourth is therthe / Of which that one is fastened in that
other / And that one sustained that other in such manner / as therthe holds
him in the myddle / The ffyre which is the first / encloseth this air / in
which we be And this air encloseth the water after / the which holds him
al about the earth All in liche wise as is seen of an egg / and as the white
encloseth the yolke / And in the myddle of the yolke is also as it were a drope
of greece which holds on no part / And the drope of greece which is in the
myddle / holds on neither part / By such and semblable regard is the earth
set in the myddle of heaven so just and so egally / that as fer is the earth
fro heaven fro above as fro bynethe ffor whersomeuer thou be upon therth / thou
art liche fer fro heaven / like as ye may see the point of a compass which is
set in the myddle of the cercle / That is to say / that it is set in the
lowest place / ffor of all fourmes that be made in the co^paas / alleway the
point is lowest in the myddle / And thus ben the four ^lementes set that one
within that other so that the earth is always in the myddle / ffor as much
space is always the heaven from under therthe as it appiereth from a boue This
figure following on that other side of the leef shows the understanding thereof
/ and deuyseth it plainly / and therefore ye may take heed thereto /

How the earth holds her right in the myddle of the world capitulo xvijo
FOr as much as therthe is heavy more than any other of thelementis / therefore
she holds her more in the myddle / and that / which is most heavy / abides
about her / ffor the thing / which most weyeth / draws most lowest / And
all that is heavy draws thereto / And therefore behooves us to Join to the
earth / and all that is extrait of therthe / if so were / and might so happene
/ that there were nothing upon therthe / watre ne other thing that let and
troubled the way / what so^euer part that a man would he might goo round
about therthe / were it man or best above and under / which part that he
would / like as a fly goth round about a round apple In like wise might a man
goo round about therthe as far as therthe dureth by nature / all about /
so that he should come under us / And it should seem to him that we were under
him / like as to us he should seem under us / ffor he should hold his feet
against ours / And the heed toward heaven / no more ne less as we do here /
and the feet toward therthe / And if he went always forth his way to fore him /
he should goo so far that he should come again to the place fro whens he first
departed / And if it were so that by adventure two men departed that one fro
that other / And that one went alleway toward the eest / and that other toward
the weste / so that both two went egally / it behooved that they should mete
again in the opposite place fro where as they departed / and both two should
come again to the place / fro whens they meuyd first / ffor then had that one
and that other goon round about the earth above and under / like as round
about a whele that were stylle on therthe in like wise should they goo about
therthe / as they that contynuelly drew them right toward the myddle of
therthe / ffor she fastneth all heavy thing toward her / And that most weyeth /
most draws and most ner holds toward the myddle / ffor who much depper
one delueth in therthe / somoche heuyer shall he find it / and for to
understand this that I have devised to you here to fore of the goynges of the
flies about thapple / and of the men about therthe / In like wise may ye see
all the manner and facion by these two fygures the which ben here to you
represented and shewde all entierly /

But for to understand the bettre / and more clerly conceive / ye may
vnderstande^by another ensample / if the earth were departed right in the
myddle / in such wise that the heaven might be seen through / And if one threw
a stone or an heavy plomette of leed that well* weyed when it should come in to
the myddle and half way through of therthe / there right should it abide / and
hold him for it might nether go lower ne arise hyer / but if it were that by
the force of the great heyght it might by the might of the weight in falling
fall more depper than the myddle / but anon it should arise again in such wise
that it should abide in the myddle of therthe / ne never after should meue thens
/ ffor then should it be egally ouerall under the firmament which torneth
night and day / And by the virtue and might of his tornyng nothing may
approach to it that is poysant and heavy / but withdraws always under it / of
which ye may see the nature and understanding by this present figure / on that
other side /

ANd if the earth were perced through in two places of which that on hole were
cut in to that other like a cross / and four men stoden right at the four
heedes of thise ij hooles / on above / and another bynethe / and in like wise
on both sides / and that each of them threw astone in to the hoole / whether
it were great or lytyl / each stone should come in to myddle of therthe /
without ever to be remeuid fro thens / But if it were drawn away by force /
And they should holden them one about another for to take place eueriche in the
myddle of therthe / And if the stones were of like weight / they should come
thereto all at one time / as soon that one as that other / ffor nature would
suffer it none other wise / And that one should come against another as ye may
plainly see by this figure /

ANd if their weight and powers were not egall fro the place fro whens they
should fall / that which were most heavy / that should sonnest come to the
myddle of therthe / And the other should be al about her as this second figure
shows plainly on that other side /

ANd so much may be cast therein that the hooles may be full / like as they
were to fore / As ye may plainly see in this figure / which shows to you the
plain truth / Now this suffyseth ynowh hereof / and here after we shall speak
of other things /

What the roundenes of the earth is. ca. xviijo
NOw then plese it you to here for to deuyse plainly to you how the earth is
round / who that might mou^te on hye in thayr and who that might behold by
valeyes and by playnes the hyenes of the great montaynes / and the great and
deep valeyes / the great wawes of the Sea and the great flodes / they should
seem less tappere unto the gretnes of the earth / than should an here of a man
do upon an apple / or under his fyngre ffor neither montayne ne valeye / how
someuer hye ne deep it be / takes not away fro therthe his roundenesse no more
than the galle leueth to be round for his prickis / ffor it behooves the earth
to be round / ffor to amasse the more people / and we shall say to you here
after / how the world must needs be round /

Wherefore god made the world al round. ca. xixo
God fourmed the world al round / ffor of all the fourmes that be / of what
dyuse manners they be / may none be so plenere ne resseyue somoche by nature /
as may the figure round / ffor that is the most ample of all figures that ye
may take example by / ffor there is none so wise ne so subtyl in all things ne
somoche can understand that may for any thing make a vessel / be it of wood
or of stone / or of metal that may be so ample / ne that may hold within it
so much in right qua^tite as shall do the round Ne figure that any may make
may so sone meue ne so lightly make his torn to goo about / that any man can
understand / but that it must take other place than this to fore / sauf only
the Round / which may meue round without taking other place / ffor she may
have non other than the first / ne pass one only ligne or Ray fro the place
where she holds her in / whereof ye may see the nature by a figure squared
set within a round / o^ another which is not round / And make them both to
torn / the corners of them that been not round shall take dyuerce places / that
the round secheth not / and that may ye see by thise iij figures in one which
ben here / of which that one is round all about And the other tweyne / ye
may see squared /

YEt is there another thing that there is nothing under heaven enclosed of what
diverse facion it be / that may so lightly meue by nature as may the round /
And therefore god made the world round / to this end that it might best be
filled on all parties / ffor he will leave nothing void / and will that it
torn day and night / ffor it behooves to have meuyng on the heaven / which
makes all to meue / ffor all meuynges come fro heaven / therefore it behooves
lightly and swyftly to meue / And without it there is nothing may meue*

Of the meuynges of heaven and of the vij planetes / and of the lytilnes of
therthe unto the Regard of heaven capitulo xxo
Owe lord god gaf meuyng unto the heaven / which goth so swyftly and so
appertly / that noman can comprise in his thought / but it seems not to us for
his gretenes / no more than it should seem to a man / if he saw fro far an
horse run v^pon a great mountain / it should not seem to him that he went an
only paas / and for somoche as he should be most far fro him / somoche the
less / should he seem to goo / And the heaven is somoche hye and ferr^ above us
/ that if a stone were in thayer as hye as the sterres be / and were the most
heuyest of all the world of leed or of metal / and began to fall fro an hye
above / this thing is proved and known / that it should not come to therthe till
the end of an hundred year / so much and far is the heaven fro us / The which
is so great / that all the earth round a boute has nothing of gretenes against
the heaven / no more than has the point or prick in the myddle of the most
great compaas that may be / ne to the grettest cercle that may be made on
therthe / and if a man were above in heaven / and beheld and looked here down in
the earth / and that all the earth were brennynge all in cooles fla^myng and
lighted / it should seem to him more lytil / than the lest sterre / that is
above / seems to us here in therthe / thawh we were on a montayne or in a
valeye / and therefore it may well be known / that the heaven must lightly meue /
when it makes his torn and goth round about therthe in a day and a night /
like as we may apperceyue by the son / that men see in the morning arise in
thoryent or in the cest / and goth down in the west / and on the morn erly we
see him come again in the eest / ffor then he has performed his course round
about therthe / which we call a day naturel / the which conteyneth in him
day and night / Thus gooth and comes the son the which never shall have
rest / ne never shall fynysshe to goo with the heaven / like as the nail that
is fixed in the whele / the which torneth when she torneth / But by cause that
it has meuyng against the course or tornyng of the firmament / we shall say to
you another reason / if a fly went round about a whele that went round it
self / and that the fly went against it / The whele should bring the fly with
her / And so should it fall that the whele should have made many tornes / whilis
that the fly should make one torn / and er she had gone round about the whele
unto the first point / So ye must understand that in such manner goon the moon and the son / by away that is comune to the vij planetes that been on the
heaven / which all goo by the same way / alleway toward the ^est / And the
heaven torneth toward the weste / like as nature ledeth him / Thus and herwith
the first party takes his end of this present book / And shall follow for to
deuyse of the second party of therthe and of the form of the firmament /

Thus ends the first party of this present book /
Here after bygynneth the second party of this present book / and declares
how therthe is divided and what party she is enhabyted / capitulo po
Sith that the earth is so lytil as ye have herd here (...) ^^re devised lytil
may we preyse the goods thereof unto the regard of heaven / less than men do
donge against fyn gold / or against precious stones / how well that in then^e that
one and that other shall be of no valewe / But for somoche as we being in this
world us seems that the earth is much great we have declared to you as well
the roundenesse as the gretenes to our power and that shortly Sith we have
understand how the earth is round on all parts as an apple / Nevertheless it
is not enhabited in all parties which is well known / of no people of the
world / And it is not enhabited but in one quarter only like as the
philosophres have enserched / which put for to know it great trauayll and
estudye / and therefore we shall deuyse it al about in four parties / of which
ye may take ensample by an Apple / which shall be parted by the myddle in four
parties right of length and of bread by the core / And pare a quarter / and
stratche the parell for to see and understand the facion in plain earth or in
your hand /

ANd in the end of this line / like as she gooth right by line / we may see a
cite which is called Aaron / it is set in the myddle of the world / and was
made all round There was founden first Astronomye by great study / by great
maistrye / and by great dilygence / This place Aaron is named the right mydday
as she that is set in the myd^le of the world / that other heed of this line
/ which gooth right toward the lift side / is called septentryon that is to
say north / and takes his name of the vij sterres / and torneth toward
another sterre that ledeth the maronners by the sea / In that other line that
is in the myddle / which the south cutteth in the end toward the eest / as
the Auctours say is paradys terrestre / where Adam was in sometime / This place
is called Oryent / that is to say cest / ffor fro thens comes the son /
which makes the day about the world And that other heed is called Occydent /
that is to say weste / ffor there the day faylleth and wexith derke / when the
son goth down there / thus and by this reason be named thefoure parties of the
world / of which the first conteyneth the eest The second the weste The
therde the south / And the fourth / the north / And this that we enseygne you
/ ye may see by this figur^ to fore on that other side /

THise iiij parties that I have declared to you / which ben set in a quarter
of all the earth of the world ought to have a round form / ffor Raison and
nature give that all the world be round / And therefore understand ye of this
quarter as it were all round / Now make we then of this quarter a cercle
that is al round and al hool / and late us set in the myddle of this line
that shows the ^^st and the weste for to set the parties in her right as
this present figure that here is represented shows to you plainly /

Affter late each party be turned toward his name in therthe / of which each
shall be the fourth part / and this present figure is enseygnement and
de^monstrau^ce certain and true without any variacion ne doubtaunce /

What part of therthe is inha^bited. ca. ijo
All the earth that is in the world enhabited is divided in t^ three parties /
and therefore it behooves by this reason to make an other dyuision / Of which the
party toward orient is called Asia the great / And takes the name of a queen
that sometime was lady of this regyon and was callid Asia / This party named
asia holds and conteyneth as much space as do the other tweyne / And
therefore it is called Asia the great and dureth fro the north unto the south^
like as this figure shows /

THat other part is called Europe and tak^th his name of a king called Europes
/ the which was lord of this contre / and therefore it was so called / And it
^ndureth fro the (...) unto the north / and marches unto Asie the g^^te That
other part is affryque which stratcheth fro the south unto the weste / and
Affryque has his name of hell / and is as much to say as born away like as
this figure deuyseth in iij parties of which figure this is the demonstrance /

Off thise three parties of the world here tofore named holden euerych many
regyons and many contrees / of which or at the least / of the most noble
party we shall declare the names / And how the bestes that been there ben most
comynly called / Thus we shall say to you the conditions and fourmes of sum /
and in especial of them that been most seen by men / And first we shall speak of
the people of the contrees / And after of the bestes and ffisshes like as the
book deuyseth to us out of which is drawn this Mappa mundi /

ffirst of paradys terrestre / and of the four great fflodes that depart fro
thens capitulo iijo
THe first regyon of Asia the great is paradys terrestre / This is a place
which is full of solace. of playsances and of delices / so that none that is
therein may be greuyd ne have none evil in no manner of the world / In this
paradys is the tree of life / and who that had eten of the fruit / he should not
deye as long as the world endures / But noman living may come theder / but if
our lord god or his angele conduyted and brought him theder / ffor all round
about / it is enclosed with fire brennyng the which goth fla^myng unto the
clouds / There withinne fourdeth and spryngeth a fontayne or well which is
divided in to four flodes / of whom that one is called vngages / that renneth a
long through the Royame of ynde / And departs in to many arms or braces / it
sourdeth of the mon^t that is called Ortobares / the which is toward thorient
/ and falls in to the sea Occian / The second of the four flodes is named
gyon / or nylus / which enters in to therthe by an hool / And renneth under
the earth so far that it resourdeth in to the long see which enuyronneth
all Ethiope so that it departs in to vij parties / and goth rennyng by
egypt so long that it comes and falls in to the great see / The other ij
flodes of which that one is called Tygris / and that other Eufrates sourden in
hermenye nygh unto a much great montayne which is named partheacus / And
thise two flodes trauerse many great contrees so long till they mete in the sea
moyen where both two fall inn like as their nature requires On this side
paradys terrestre all about ben many diverse places without any resort /
ffor none may dwell there n^ find place to live in / but there be plente of
evil beestis which ben fires and crymynel and of many guyses there ben / There
ben gean^ts rowh^ and heery which deu^ure and ete all thing as wulues don /
And many other wild beestes /

Here speaks of ynde and of things that be found therein / capitulo iiijo
Affter comen the contrees of yndes which take their name of a water that is
called ynde / which sourdeth in the north / The yndes ben closed with the
great see that enuyronneth them round about In ynde is an isle named Probane
wherein ben founded ten cytees and plente of other towns / where as every year
ben two summers and two wynters / And ben so attemprid that there is always
verdure / and upon the trees ben contynuelly flowers. leeuis and fruit / And it
is much plenteuous of gold and silver and much fertyle of other things /
There be the great montaynes of gold and of precious stones and of other
richesses plente / But noman dar approach it for the dragons and for the
gryffons wild which have bodies of lyouns / fleyng which easily bear a man
away armed and syttyng upon his horse / when he may sease him with his claws
and vngles There ben yet plente of other places so delectable so sweet and so
spyrytuel that if a man were therein / he should say / that it were a very
paradys /

Here follows the dyuersitees being in the land of ynde capitulo vo
THere is in the land of ynde a right great montayne / that men call mount
capien / and it is a much great regyon There ben a manner of people without wit
and without discrescion / which the king Alysaundre enclosed therein / And ben
named goths and magoths or gog or magog / they ete flessh all raw be it men or
wymmen or bestes as men wood. mad or demonyacks / This ynde of which I you
reherce conteyneth xiiij Regyons / and in euerich of thise regyons ben much
people / And also there is therein great trees and so hye that they towche the
clou^des / And there dwells people that been horned / and ar but ij cubits hye
/ And they goon to gydre in great co^panyes ffor often they fight against the
Cranes / which them assaylle / But within vij year they become aged and old
that they deye for age / This people is called pygmans / and ben as lytil as
dwarfes / Right nygh^ unto this contree grows pepre all whytte / But the
vermyne is there so great that when they would gadre and take it / they must
set fire therein for to drive away the vermyne / and when it is so brent / the
pepre is founden al black scorchid and cryspe / yet ben there other people
which ben called groyne and bragman which ben fayrer than they to fore named
/ that for to save another life / will put them in to a brennyng fire / There is
yet another manner of people / the which when their fadres and modres or their
other friends ben passing old and eaged / they slay them and sacryfye them /
be it wrong or right and eten their flesh / and holden them for meschan^t and
nygardis that so do not to their friends / ffor they hold this manner among
them for great well. great worship. and for great largess / and therefore each
of them use it / Toward the e^st is another manner of people that worship the
son only and takes it for their god for the great goods that come thereby /
And by cause that in all the world they see none so fair a thing to their
semyng / they believe in hit as their god / yet ben there other people that been al
rough^ / which eten fysshe al Raw and drink water of the salt see / Toward
this same contre is a manner of people that been half bestes and half men / yet
ben there in that party other people which have on one foot viij toes / In
thise contrees is great nombre of bestes right dredful and terryble / which
have bodies of men and heedes of dogs / And have so great vngles or claws
that areste all that they can hold and clothe them with the hydes and skynnes
of bestes / And have such manner of wys as barkyng of dogs / yet ben there
other called Cyclopyens which pass by rennyng the wind / and have only but
one foot / of which the plant is so righ^ long and so broad / that they
couere them therewith fro the shadow / when the hete comes over sharp on them
/ another manner people there is / which have only but one eye / and that
stands right in the myddys of the front or forhede which is so reed and so
clear that it seems properly fire brennyng / And there also ben found another
manner of people that have the visage and the mouth in the myddle of their breast
/ and have one eye in every sholdre / and their nose hangs down to their
mouth / and have brestles about their mosell like swyne / yet ben there founden
toward the river of ganges a manner of strange people and curtoys / which have
the right figure of a man / which live only by the odor and smellyng of an
apple only / And if they goo far in to any place / they have need to have
thapple with them / ffor if they feel any stenche evil and stynckyng and have
not thapple / they deye incontinent /

Of the serpents and of the bestes of ynde / ca. vjo
IN ynde ben plente of serpents / which ben of such force and might / that
they devour and take by strength the hertes and buckes / yet there is another
manner best which is called Centycore which has the horn of an heart in the
myddle of his face. And has the breasts and thyes like a lion / and has great
eeris and feet like an horse / And has a round mouth / his mosell is like the
heed of a Bear / And his eyes ben nyghe that one that other / And his voys is
much like the voys of a man / Another best men find there much fyers /
which has the body of an horse / the heed of wild boor / and the tayll of an
Olyphaunt / And he has two horns which eueriche is as long as a Cubyte / of
which he set that one upon his back whylis he fyghteth with that other / he
is black and a much terryble best and merueyllous delyure / And is both in
watre and on the land / There ben also seen bullys which ben all white /
They have great hedes / and their throat is as wide and broad that it endures
from that one eere to that other and have horns that remeue about him so that
noman may tame ne danute them / Another manner of bestes there is in ynde that been called manticora / and has visage of a man / and three huge great teeth in
his throat / he has eyes like a ghoot and body of a lion / tayll of a Scorpyon
and voys of a serpente in such wise that by his sweet song he draws to him
the people and deuoureth them And is more delyuerer to goo / than is a foul to
flee / There is also a manner of Oxen or buefs that have their feet all round and
have in the myddle of their front iij horns / yet is there there another best
of much fair corsage or shappe of body which is cal^^d monotheros / which
has the body of an horse / and feet of an Olyfant / heed of an heart and voys
clear and hye and a great tail / And has but one horn / which is in the
myddle of his forhede / which is four foot long right and sharp like a swerd
and cuttyng like a Rasour / And all that he atteyneth to fore him and towcheth
is broken and cut / and for truth this best is of such condition that by
what someuer engyne he is taken / of great desdayn he suffers to be slain and
deye / But he may not be taken but by a pure virgyne / which is set to sore
him where as he shall pass / the which must be well and gentylly arrayed /
Then comes the best unto the maid much symply / and slepeth in her lap
/ And so he is taken slepyng In ynde ben there other bestes gre^e and fyrs
which ben of blew colowr / and have clear spots on the body / and ben so
right strong and crymynell that noman dar approach them / and ben named Tygris
/ And they run so swyftly / And by so great might that the hunters may not
escape fro them in no wise / but if they take myrrours of glass and cast them
in the way where they shall run / ffor the tygris ben of such nature / that
when they see their semblau^ce / they wene that it be their fawnes Then goon
they about the myrrours so long til they break the glass / and see no more /
in which while the hunters escape fro them that been there / And sometime it
happeth so of thise tygr^s that they think so long and behold their figures
/ that otherwhyle they ben taken so lokyng all quyck and living / Yet ben there
other beestes which ben called Castours / which have this nature in them /
that when they ben honted far to be taken / they byte with their teeth their
own genytoirs or ballocks / and let them fall / and thus they ghelde them
self / ffor they well know* that for none other thing they be hunted / also
there grows another best like a Mous / and has a lyti^^ mouth and is named
Musk or muskali^^ / In this contree ben the dry trees that spoke to
Alysaundre the puissaunt king / Another best there is that men call
Salemandre which is fed and nourysshed in the fire / This Salemnadre berith
wulle / of which is made cloth and gyrdles that may not beenne in the fire /
There ben yet myes the which ben as great as cattes and also swyft in rennyng
Toward thoryent ben the lions which have mere strength and might / in their
beestes to fore and in all their membees than any other best have / And they
come to feed their fawnes the iij day after they have fawned / as they that
were deed and ben as raised again from death / and when they sleep they hold
their eyes open / And when the hunters hunte them they cover the traas of their
feet with their taylle / They shall never do harm ne grief to man / but if they
ben angered And when they be assayl^ed they deffende them / And when he that
keeps them beat and chastyseth a lytil dog to fore them / they fere and
doubt him like as they knew him well / and the lyonnesse has the first year
five fawnes / and every year after following one less unto her end so
declynyng / There is another best which is lytil / and is so terryble and
redoubted / that no best dar approach it / And by nature the lion doubts and
fl^eth from it / ffor often it sleeth the lion / In this party conuerseth and
repayreth another best which is of dyuse colors by spots white. black.
grene. blewe and yelow / like as it were painted / and is much propre and is
called panthere / and there comes out of his mouth so sweet a savor and b^eeth
/ that the beestes goo following after it for the swetnes of his body / sauf the
serpent / to whom this sweet smelle greueth in such wise that often the serpent
deyeth / and when this beeste is otherwhile so filled and full of venyson that
he has taken and eten / He slepeth iij days hool without awakyng / And when
he awaketh / he gives out of his mouth so sweet a savor and smelle / that
anon the beestes that feel it seche him / This be has but ones young fawnes
/ And when she shall fawn / she has such destresse and anguyssh^ / that she
beeketh with her naylles and renteth her matryce in such wise that her fawnes
come out / And never after when the matryce is rent and broken they engendre
ne bring forth fawnes / There is a manner of Mares that conceive of the wind /
and ben in a contre that is named Capadoce / but they endure not but iij year /
In this contre ben the Olyphauns / which is a best great strong and fyghtyng
/ And when they see their blood shed to fore them / they be most corageous
and most strong and fright in all places and all bataylles / upon this
olyphaunts were wont to fight the people of ynde and of perse / ffor an
olyphaunt bears well a tour of w^ode upon his back fulle of men of Arms / when
it is well set on and fermly / And they have to sore them in manner of boyell
great and large / which they ete / by which they run on men / and have anon
devoured them / King Alysaundr^ which was a good clerk and prince of great
reco^mendaco^n and that went in to many contrees for to search and inquire the
adventures more than he did to conquer / then when he should fight against
them that had taught and learned tholyfau^tes to fight in plain land / he did
do make vessels of copper in form of men / and did do fylle them with fire
brennyng / and set them to fore him to fight against them that were upon
tholyfauntes / And when tholyfau^tes cast their boyel by which they slew the
people upon tho men of copper / feelyng that they were so hoot that they brenned
them / Then they that were so taught would no more approach tho men for doubt
of the fire / ffor they thought / that all men had been as hoot / as they were
of copper / which were full of fire / And thus king alysau^dre as a sage
prince eschewed the parell and danger of thise olyfauntes / And conquered this
wild people / and in such wise dompted tholyfauntes that they durst ^oo no /
more harm unto the men / The olyfauntes goo^moche symply and accordyngly to
gydee / And when they mets and encountre each other / they bow their heedes
that on^ to that other like as they entresalewed each other / They be right
cold of nature / whereof it is so that when one puts upon the tooth of
yuorye a lynnen cloth and brennyng cooles there upon / the lynnen cloth shall not
brenne / ffor as soon as the cool feleth the cold he quenches / the yuorye is
so cold / The tooth of an olyfaunt is yuorye / Tholyfauns have never young
fawnes but ones in long time / and they bear them ij year in their flanks /
an olyfaunt lives CCC year / He doubts and fereth the wesell and the
culeuure and dredeth vermyne / if the culeuure clyue and be on tholyfau^t-it
departs not till it has slain him / She fawneth her fawnes and hydeth them
where is no wood and fawneth in the water / ffor if she lay on therthe she
should never arise ne ^^leue / ffor as much their bones ben al hool without
Joints from the belly unto the feet / And when tholyphaunt will sleep / he
leneth unto a tree and there slepeth stondyng / And the hunters that seche them
and know the trees to which they ^^ne when they slep^ / Then when they have
founden them / they saw them low by the ground almost a sondre / that when
tholyfaunt comes and knows nothing thereof and would sleep and leneth to the
tree / and anon he falls with the tree unto the ground and may not releue
him self / Then he begins for to b^aye cry and waylle / that sometime there
come many olyfauntes to him for to help him / And when they may not redress
and reyse him they cry and braye and make a merueyllous sorrow / And they that been most lytil and small goo about for to lift and reyse him to their power
in such wise that other while they lift and reyse him up / But when they may
not reyse ne releue him / they goon their way wayllyng and making great sorrow
and leave him / And the hunters that been embusshed by / come and by their engyns
that they have propice for the same take him / thus by this subtylte ben
tholyfateu^s taken / Within the river and flode of ynde named Ganges goon the
ecles by great renges which ben.CCC. feet long and ben good mete to ete at
need Many other bestes peryllous and terryble ben there in ynde as dragons
serpents and other diverse beestes which have feet. heedes. and taylles
diverse / There ben the basylicocks / which have the sight so venymous that
they sle all men And in like wise do they all fowls and beestes / he has
the heed like a cock and body of a serpent / he is king of all serpents /
like as the lion is king above all beestes / he is white rayed her^ and there
/ there is neither herb ne fruit on the earth whereby he shall pass / ne the
trees that been planted but they shall per^sshe / if he have byte or slain best
or other thing / Never other beeste dar approach it / There is in this Regyon
another manner of serpents that have horns like a sheep / There grows a be
named Aspis that may not be deceyuyd ne taken but by charmyng / ffor he heerith
gladly the sown / But as soon as he heerith the charm he puts his taylle in
his one cere / And that other he leyeth to the ground doubtyng to be deceyuyd
by the charm / Other serpents there be / which be named Tygris which ben
taken all quyck by force of engyns / And of them men make tryacle / which
deffeteth and takes away other venym / Other worms there grow there / which
have two arms so long and so diverse that they beat and slay the Olyphaunts /
This worm lives right long / And when he is old and feleth him feeble / he
consumes him self by fasting / and suffers to be enfamyned so ouermoche that
lytil abides of his body / Then he goth in to a lytil hool of sum stone
which is well strayt and then he puts him self out with so right great
distress / that his skin remains al hool / And there grows and comes on
him another skin / And thus renews his age as a wise best that he is / There
ben plente of other serpents that have many precious stones in the heedes and
in the eyes / the which ben of right great virtue for them that might have
them and bear them / Now we shall deuyse to you of stones that grow in ynde and
ben there founden /

Here follows of precious stones and of their virtue which grow in ynde
capitulo vijo
IN ynde grows the Admont stone / which is a stone charged with many great
virtues / She by her nature draws to her iron and makes it to cleue to it so
fast / that it may uneath be taken fro it for the virtue that is in it / The
dyamont grows also in ynde all hool / and it may not be broken in pieces ne
used / but it be by the virtue of the blood of a ghoot all hoot / yet grow
there other stones of many diverse facions and virtues / the which ben of
much noble recomendacion reno^m^^ and of much fair virtue / and first I shall
speak of the Emerawde which is so playsaunt to the eye / that it reconforteth
all the sight of him that beholds it / In like wise grows in ynde an other
stone the which is called Carboncle / the which by night or if it be in derke
place and obscure / it shyneth as a cole brennyng / Also there grow Sapphires
which by their virtue take away the swellyng and redenes of the eyes / There
grows also a stone called Topace which is of color like unto fyn gold and
also is of hye virtue / yet also there grow there Rubyes / which is a stone
much preysed and loved among the people / and is also of right more great
valewre and virtue than is the toupace / she reioyseth the sight and comfort
it much and specially to them that bear it / yet ben there also in ynde plente
of other manner stones which have in them much fair virtues and bountees / And
who that will more know of their virtues and bountees may read in the book
called lapydayre / in which he shall know the names and virtues / ffor now at
this time we shall make an end of this matter / for to recounte you the contrees
and Royames of ynde /

Here follows of the contrees and Royammes of ynde capitulo viijo
IN ynde is plente of great contrees merueyllously / which ben peopled with
diverse manners of people and of great plente of bestes of many diverse facions
and conditions / Emonge all other there is a contree named Perse and conteyneth
xxxiij regyons of which the first is the Royame of Perse / where as a science
called Nygromancie was first founden / which science constrayneth the enemy
the fend to be taken and hold prisonner / In this contree grow^th a pese
which is so hoot that it skaldeth the hands of them that hold it / and it
growyth with encresyng of the moon / and with wanyng it discreceth at each time
of his course / it helps well to them that been nygromanciers / After this
Royame is another which is called Mesopotamye / wherein Nynyu^ a Cite of great
seynourye and mighty is set and establisshid which is iij day Iourneyes of
length and is much large and brood / In babylone is a tour that sometime was
made by great pride of which the wallis ben meruayllously great. strong. and
hye / and is called the towr of babel / it is of heyght round about.iiij.M.
paas unto the highest / In the Regyon of Caldee was first founden Astronomye / In
this Regyon is the land of Saba / and thereby is the Regyon of Tharse / And
after is that of Arabe / Of thise iij Regyons were lords and princes the three
kings that offryd to our lord savior Ihesu Christ gold. encence. and Myrre /
that time when he lay in the Crybbe aftyr his blessed Natyuyte as he that was
the sone of god / And this knew they by their great wit and understanding of
astronomye in which they were endowed and founded / In this Regyon of Arabe
grows then^cence and the myrre / And there ben therein many peples and diverse
folk / There is also in Egypt a Regyon which is called Assyrie / And the
Regyon of ffenyce is there / which takes his name of a bird called ffenyx /
of which in all the world is on this day but only one a live / and when he
deyeth / anon grows another of him self / he is great and much fair of
Corsage / and has a creste on his heed / like as the pecok has / The breast
and the gorge of him shyneth and draws toward the propre color of fyn gold
/ And he is alonge on the back also r^ed as a rose / And toward the tayll he is
of the color of Asure like unto the heaven when it is pure and cler^ / and when
he is old and eaged he withdraws him unto an hye and meruayllous fair place
/ or montaygne where as sourdeth a fontayne right great and large / and the
water fair and clear / And over the well grows a fair tree and great. which
may be seen fro far / And he makes upon this tree his neste and his
sepulture right in the myddle of the tree / But he makes it of spices of so
right great odor that there may be founden no better / And after he adressyth
him in his neste when he has all performed it / he then begins to meue
and to beat his wings against the son so fast and so long / that a great
het^ comes in his feathers in such wise that it quykeneth of fire and b^enneth
al round about his body that he is on a clear fire / And thus the fire
b^enneth and consumes him all in to ashes / and out of thise ashes and
pouldre grows again another bird all living semblable to him / After this
regyon of fenyce is the Royame of damas where as good fruytes grow / And after
damas is founden the Regyon of Anthyoche where as be founden great plente of
Camels / After comes the contre of Palatyne / and after that Samarye / then
Sebaste / and then Penthapolye where sometime were founded two mighty cytees
that one called Sodom and that other Gomor / the which god would they should
perisshe for the great and enorme sins that they commysed / On this part is
the deed see in which is nothing that bears life / there is a contree that men
call ysmaelite / which is enhabyted by xij manner of people / and after this
then is Egypt the great where it never reyneth and conteyneth xxiiij peoples
Another Regyon there is the which comes toward the north in which there
dwelleth^ noman / but wymmen which ben as fyers as lions / And when need is
they fight freely against the men / They go armed as knights in bataylle / And
b^ynge down their enemies without sparynge / they have fair tresses of their
here which hang down byhynde them / And they be garnysshed with great
prowesses in all their works and affairs / And ben called Amazones / But
they have men nyghe to their contre dwelling / whom they every year fetch for
to be in their company viij or xv days long and suffer them to know them
carnelly so long that they suppose that they have conceyuyd / And then
depart the men fro that contre and goon again thedyr that they come fro / and
when thise wymmen have childed / if it be a daughter they reteyne her with them
/ And if it be a sone they nourysshe it five or vj year / and after send it
out of the contre / yet in other places ben many fair ladies which in
betaylles and in estowrs use all their Arms of silver for lack of iron and
of steel / of which they have not / In the woods of ynde ben other wymmen the
which have their berdes so long that they come down to their pappes / They
live by wild beestis / and clothe them with the skynnes of the same beestis /
And there ben men and wymmen all naked and also Rowhe as beeres and ben
dwelling in caves in the earth / and when they see other men they hyde them in
the caves so that they appear not out Other people there ben that been also Rowhe
as swyne and whynyng / And there ben other wymmen Rowh^ also like unto the men /
but they ben much bestyall and white as snow / their teeth ben more like unto
hounds than to other and dwell and abide well in the water / Another great
regyon there is in which dwell xliij peoples / There ben the birds which ben
full of deduyte / of whom the pens shine by night like unto fire / There ben
popengayes which ben grene and shynyng like pecoks which ben but lytil more
than a Iaye / of whom as men say / they that have on each foot five claws ben
gentyl and the vylayns have but three / he has a tayll lengre than a foot / and
a beck courbed and a great tongue and forked / who that might have one he
might well learn him to speak in the space of two year / Another bird there is
in this contre which is named pellicane / and all hoor when he leueth his
chekens / and comes again to feed them as is of need / him seems that they
ben al deed / Then he smyteth him self with his bylle in his breast till that
the blood spring out / whereof he reyseth again to life his birds In armenye is
a manner of people that have al their here white / In thise parties is a much
hye mountain where upon the Ark of Noah abood and rested after the flood was
passed / After comes the prouynce of ynde the less which is all enuyronned
with the sea wherein ben many regions of whom for this present time we will not
declare the names / In this prouynce of Asie is the Regyon of dardane / and the
contre of ffrygye in to which paris when he had rauisshed helayne brought her
to / wherefore the puissaunte cite of Troy the great was at thempryse of the
greeks destroyed by fire and glayue / This Cite was set at one of thendes of
greece / In thise party is set the noble Cite of lychaonie / And nygh^e to
the same stondeth another Cite called Cayer by which renneth the great flood
name herme of which the grauel is of gold all shynyng / ffro this part toward
the end of egypt comes to us the paillole which is of fyn gold / There is
toward thoryent on that other side a manner of people that sometime descended fro
the Jews / and ben people of their condition vile. fowl. and stynkyng / they
have no wives wedded ne hold no concubynes ne other for as much as they may
not believe that wymmen may hold them to one man only without to double them
with other And therefore they set no store by wymmen / but only that they may
have generation / Another manner of people there ben in this prouynce which ben
called barbaryns / and ben also called Iacobyns / ffor Jacob was au^cyently
their maistre And ben christian men corrumped by the marriages and Alyaunces that
they do and make with the sarasyns which on that one side march on them
Thise barbaryns pourpryse well xl Royammes / In no wise they believe that
confession be vayllable to show it to any man sauf to god only / when they
confess them to god they set by them fire and encence / And they wene
certainly that their thoughts goo up unto our lord in this fumee / but it is
not so as they believe / but they mysbylcue saint Johan baptiste the which
first baptized them / ffor to fore all things they behooved to say their
sins to him self And after they received of him baptesme / ffor saint Johan
baptest says him self that when one tells his sins to another that may be
a sinner as he is / this shame that he has to say his sins is turned to him
instead of penytence / and is to him allegiance of his sins / and him ought
by reason the sonner to absteyne him fro synnyng / seen that he must show them
to another man / by which he may have of our lord remyssion and pardon of his
sins and myquytees / this witnesses to us saint Ioh^n baptyst / the which
by the holy and blessed sacrament of baptesme renders us quyte against our lord
god of our sins / and that we may be purged by very confession / good
contricion and full satisfacion euerych after his power / Therefore thise Iacobyns
ben greatly deceived / ffor they have evil retained the wholesome doctrine that
saint Johan baptyst taught them / In this regyon is another manner of people
Christian that believe a lytil better in god and ben strong and mighty in
bataylle / the sarasyns doubt them much And dar not mysdoo them / but ben to
them sweet and amyable / thise people be named Georgiens / and ben good christian
men / And ben enclosed round about with feloun and mysbyleuyd people / And they
ben called as before is said georgiens / because they cry alleway on saint
george in battle in estours and in Recountres against the sarasyns / And also
they worshype and love him above all other seyntes / They have all crowns
shaven on their heedes / But the clerks have them round And the lay people
have them square / when they goo to Iherusalem for to worshipe the holy
sepulcre of our lord Ihesus / The sarrasyns dar not take of them any toll ne
nothing hurt them by cause they doubt that when they come and repair again
they should abye it dear / The gentyl ladies of the contre Arm them and ride
upon good horses rennyng and swyfte / and fight asprely in the company of the
knights of Georgie against the sarasyns / They use like laws / and like terms
of speech as don the greeks /

Hier speaks of the ffysshes that be fou^den in ynde. ca. ixo
IN the sea of ynde is a manner of ffysshes that on their skynnes grow here so
long that the people make thereof robes mantellis and other vestementis which
they were when they have taken and made them / Yet there is another manner of
ffysshe in this see / which ben named escimuz which ben no lengre that a foot
long / but they have such strength that in contynent that they touch a ship
one of them only reteyneth him stylle that he may not goo forward ne afterward
There is also another manner of ffysshe that be comynly called dolphyns / they
have a custom that when they feel that the tempest shall come / and that the
ships ben in danger for to be lost and perisshid / they warn them out of
the watre and show and play on the wawes of the sea in such wise that
sometime they be plainly seen In this see of ynde is another fysshe so huge and
great that on his back grows earth and grass / And seems proprely that it
is a great I Will / whereof it happeth sometime that the maronners sayllyng by this
see ben greatly deceived and abused / ffor they wene certainly that it be ferme
land / wherefore they goo out of their ships thereon / and when they have made
their preparacions and their logys thereon and lyghted their fire and made it to
brenne after their need / wenyng to be on a ferme land / but incontinent as
this merueyllous fysshe feleth the hete of the fire / he meuyth him suddenly and
deualeth down in to the water as deep as he may / And thus all that is upon
him is lost in the sea / And by this moyen / many ships ben drowned and
perisshid / and the people / when they supposed to have be in sauete / There is
in this see plente of other ffysshe the which have heedes and bodies like unto
a maid / and have fair tresses made of their here / The shapp of their bodies
unto the nauel is like a maid / And the remenaunt is like the body and tayll
of a fysshe / And sum have wings like fowls / And their song is so sweet
and so melodyous that it is meruaylle to here and they be called seraynes or
mermaydens / Of whom sum say that they be fysshis / And other say that they
be fowls which flee by the sea / But take it aworth / ffor at this time I
shall deporte to speak more of this matter / ffor to tell and recounte to you of
the meruayllous trees that grow in ynde / Of which ben many diverse and bear
sondrely fruit / as here after al a long shall be declared to you /

Hew follows of the trees that been in ynde and of their fruytes / capitulo xo
IN ynde grows a tree much great and right faye / And is much sweet
smellyng and is called palmyer / and bears dates / This fruit is good and
holsom There ben also apple trees the which ben full of long apples / which
ben of merueyllous good savor / And they entretiene and cleue to gydre well an
hundred in a clustre And the l^ues that grow on this apple trees ben well two
foot long / and a foot broad / Other apples there grow much great / wherein
appiereth the bytte of a man with his teeth / And ben called thapples of Adam
by cause of the bytte that appiereth in them / There ben other trees which bear
apples / that been right fair without forth / And within it is as it were ashes
/ The vygnes bear there grapes / of which wyn^ is maad / they ben so
habendaunt of fruit / And the clustres of grapes ben so great and so full of
Must / that two men ben greatly charged to bear one of them only upon a
colestaff / Also there grow lytil small trees that be remeuyd every year the
which bear cotoun / Also there grow in many places canes great and long /
which ben within forth full of sugre / so much and especial that there grow
none like in all the world / At one of the hedes of the Royame of babylone
grows the ^ame which is much dear / and christian men that been prisonners
there delue and labor the earth / And the sarasyns say that they have often
preuyd it / that when they do delue and labor that earth with people of other
nations than christian men that it lereth no fruit ne bame that year / And upon
the field where the bame grows / sum say that there spryngeth a fontayne
where the blessed virgyne Marie bayned her sone Ihesus / And with the watre of
this fontayne is the bame watered / and of this water may not be employed ne
born in to other place / ffor in substance it does no more than other water /
In this contre ben other trees the which instead of leaves bear wulle / of
which is made cloth right fair and subtyle / of which thynhabitauns of the
contre make them robes and mantelli^ for their weryng / yet ben there other
trees that bear a fruit right sweet smellyng / But this tree takyth his fruit
by night in him / and in the morning it comes out again when the son is
risen / There grow there plente of other trees / Of whom the cooles when they
be afyre duren in their ashes an hole yer without going out. or quenchyng or
mynuyssyng / Also there grow plente of Cedres and of lybans / the which as men
say may not rote / other trees there grow much glorious and right good
which bear clowes And other that bear notemygges / And of the rynde and scorce
is the canell or synamom^ / and also there grows gynger / In this party grow
the good espyces of all manner habou^dantly / Also there grow notes great
plente / which ben also great as great Apples / and other that been as great as
the head of a man / To the Regard of the trees that been in paradys terrestre we
know not what fruit they being forth / But it is well known of the tree /
that Eve had so great desire to ete above the commandment of our lord goo /
and of which she deceived Adam our first fader / and in like wise is there the
tree of life / of which we have spoken to fore more largely / There ben in this
right noble paradys so many other tree^ beryng fruit so good and so delicyous
that it seems that the glory of our lord be therein ouerall / But there is a
meruayllous watch and kepar / ffor the Angele of god is kepar of thentree with
a naked swerd in his hand contynuelly brennyng / to the end that nomen ne
bestes ne evil spirytes approach ne Auaunce them for to take in any wise there
their delytes and playsaunces / and ^accomplissh them there within / And here
with we make an end of this purpoos for to speak of the contrees of Europe and
of the conditions /

Now follows of Europe and of his contrees / ca. xjo
Sith we have devised to you of Asye and of his contrees and regyons / I shall
say to you of Europe and his conditions shortly / ffor as much as we may often
here speak thereof / The first party of Europe is Romanye and a part of
Constantynoble / Trapesonde. Macedone. Thesalye. Boheme. Sapronye. Pyrre. and a
much holsom contre named Archade / In this contre sourdeth and spryngeth a
fontayne in which men may not quench brennyng brondes / ne cooles on fire and
brennyng / In Archade is a stone which in no wise may be quenchyd after it is
set a fire till it be all brent in to ashes / After Archade is the Royame of
denemarke / and then Hongrye / and sithe hosterich^ / and then follows
germanye which we call Almayne which conteyneth a great pourprys toward
thoccident / in which pourprys ben many great and puissaunt Royames / In
Allemayne sourdeth a great flood and ryuere named dunoe / the which stratcheth
unto in Constantynople / and there enters in to the sea / but erst it trauscth
vij great floodes by his radour and rennyng / and as I have herd say the head
of this dunoe begins on one side of a montayne / and that other side of the
same mo^tayne sourdeth another great river / which is named the rijn and
renneth thurgh^ almayne by basyle / strawsburgh Magounce / Couelence / Coleyn /
and nemyng / where fast by it departs in to iiij ryuers and renneth through
the lands of ghelres. Cleue and holande and so in to the sea / And yet er this
river enter in to the sea / he enters in to another river named the mase / and
than loses he his name / and is called the mase / and mase deep xl mile long
in the sea / In europe is also swauen / basse Almayn / ffraunce / England /
scotland and Irlonde / And above thise many other contree^ which endure unto
the mount Ius / and thus much space holds the party of Europe / Now shall we
deuyse to you how much Affryke conteyneth /

Here follows of Affryke and of his regyons and contrees capitulo xijo
AFter Europe is Affryke / of which the regyon of lybe is the first / This is
a land much rich. well peopled and strongly garnysshid / After comes the
roya^me of Surrye. Iherusalem and the country about / This is the holy land
where our lord Ihesu Christ receyuid our humanyte and passion / and where he
roos fro death to life / After thoppynyon of sum is that this holy land
longs to Asye / After then comes Greece. Cypres. Cecyle. Toscane. Naples.
Lombardye. Gascoyne. Spain. Cateloyne. Galyce. Navarre. Portyngal. and Aragon
And how be it that the Auctour of this book say that thise contrees ben in
Affryke / yet as I understand all^ thise ben within the lymytes and bounds of
europe / Also there ben sum of thise regions and contrees that take their name
of sum beestes that dwell in the same lands / and the cytees have taken the
fourmes / as rome has the form of a lion / And Troy the great of an horse
etc / All barbarye is in Affryke and Alysandre / And ethiope stratcheth unto
the end of Affryke / In this contre of ethiope the people ben black for hete of
the son / ffor it is so hoot in this contre / that it seems that the earth
should brenne / Beyond ethyope is no land but deserte / and land without
bryngyng forth of any fruit / but it is full of serpents / of vermyne and of
wild beestis which land ends at the great see /

Here shall we speak of diverse yles of the sea. ca. xiijo
Sith we have descryuid and devised the land / it is reason that we inquire of
the yles of the sea / And in especial of them that we know the names of which
there ben plente in the sce / There is a much great isle called andos / which is
toward europe / and sith is the isle of colchos / where the flies of gold was
found like as to us reherceth thystorye of Jason / There is another isle called
Maron / in this isle was born the holy man saint denis which receyuid martyrdom
in france / Toward asye the great ben the nombre of xliiij / There is one isle
named delos / this isle appiered first after noes flood / there is another which
is called Meloth / And it is so called for the right great melodye that is herd
therein of sweet song of birds that been in this isle contynuelly / in this isle
grows plente of white Marble / There is another isle in this contre that is
called psalmos in which the queen sebylle was born / the which prophesied of
many things of our lord Ihesu christ long time before he was born of the
virgyn^ marie / and she prophesied thise things at rome / where she was sent
fore / In this isle was first fou^den the manner to make pottes of earth / which
ben yet used in many contrees / In this isle was born a great philosophre and a
good clerk named pictogoras / the which by his great entendement fond the
points and the difference of musyque / In affryke is also an isle in the sea
which is callid sardayne / where an herb grows which is of such virtue
that if one ete of it he deyeth anon forth with all lawhyng / Another isle there
is named bosut wherein is no serpent ne vermyne / And there is another which is
called colombyne / where as is great plente and foyson of vermyne and
meruayllous serpents / yet there is another isle that is much long and right
broad that is called alleares / In this isle was first founden the manner of
meltyng of metals / Also there is the isle of Meroes the which at the myddle of
the day has no shadewe / yet there is a pytte in this isle that by right nombre
and mesure is.vij. foot ^edde and an hundred foot deep / And the son shyneth
in to the bottom / Also there is another isle which is called Cylla where the
Cyclopiens were sometime / Another isle is in this contre so great as the wise
plato witnesseth^ the which in his time was a clercke of right great renommee
/ which has more of pourpris and space than all Europe and affryke conteynen
/ But since the time of plato it was in such wise destroyed and broken like as
it plesid our lord / that it sanke down in to Abisme for the great sins that
they co^mysed y^ were dwellars and inhabitau^s therein / And is now the sea
right that is called bethee / another isle is there the which may not be seen
when men would goo thereto / but sum goo thither as men say / and it is called
the isle lost / This isle fond saint Brandon the which being therein on ferme
land saw and fond many meruailles like (...) his legende conteyneth / and
who that will know it may visyte his legende and read it / In the marches
hetherward ben fond many good yles The isle of Cypre and of Secyle there ben and
other plente that be founden in the sea / of which I now speak not / And be
not admeruaylled of such things as ye have fou^den wreton in this present
book / the which may seem to you much strange dyuse and much diffycile to
bileue / ffor our lord god which is almighty maker and creator of all things
/ and in whom all goods and virtues ben / h^ath made by his only will and
playsir in the earth many meruaylles and many works to be meruaylled on by
cause that noman knows by no way the raysons wherefore / and therefore we
ought not to mysbileue in no wise that we here read ne told of the meruaylles
of the world unto the time we know it be so or no / ffor the works of our
lord ben so hye and to the men so difficile and hard that every man may report
him to that / that it is / how well that a man does not much amys sometime to
give no bileue to so^me things / when he knows not ye truth / so that it
be not in erryng against ye faith / ffor it is a good and prouffytable thing to
euy man to understand and reteyne to the end that he may learn / of which he
be not abashed when he heereth speak of such things / and can answer to the
truth / ffor in like wise as to us seem great meruaille of things that I
here reherce / In like wise seems it to them that been fer fro us / that those
things of thise co^trees ben much diverse and strange / and meruaylle greatly
by cause they have litil seen of it / and therefore a man ought not to meruaylle
if he here sometime any thing though he can not understand the rayson / ffor
alleway a man ought to learn / and there is noman that knows all / sauf only
god which all sees and all knows / The geaunts that been in some place have
right great meruaylle / of this that we be so lytil against them / Like as we
meruaylle of them that been half less than we be / as it is tofore said / And
they ben the Pygmans which ben but iij foot long / And in like wise meruaylle
they of us / of that we ben so great / and repute us also for geaunts / They
that have but one eye and one foot / have great meruaylle that we have tweyne /
like as we do of them that have but one / And also as we deuyse their bestis
and name them by their names / in like wise deuyse they ours / by theires /
both of body and of members / if the centicore have an foot of an horse / in
like wise has the horse the foot of a centicore / Also we may well say that the
horse has the body of monotheros / ffor they ben like of corsaige / And thus
their bestes resemble unto ours which ben diverse of heedes of bodies and of
menbres / as ours ben contrary to theires /

Of dyuersytees that been in Europe and in Affryke capitulo xiiijo
WE have in thise parties many things that they of Asye and of Affryke have
none / There is toward Irlonde on the one side a manner of birds that flee and
they grown on trees and on old shipp sides by the bylles And when they be
nygh ripe / they that fall in the water live / and the other not / they ben
called bernacles / Irland is a great Ilonde in which is no serpent ne venomous
beeste / And who that bears. with him the earth of this isle in to another
contre and leyeth it where as venymous vermyne is / there anon it deyeth /
Another ylonde is in irlonde which stondeth far in the s^e / where no wymmen
may dwell / and also the birds that been femalles may not abide there / There
is another isle wherein nomen may dye in no time of the world / but when they ben
so old and feeble that their members faylle and ache and live with pain that
they may not help ne sustain them self / and that they had leu^r dye than
live / they do them to be born in to another isle and over the water for to dye
/ And the trees that been in this isle keep their leaves grene and in verdure all
times winter and somer / In another isle in Islonde the night endures vj
months / and then comes the day that dureth other vj months shynyng
fair and clear / another place is in the same ylonde which brenneth night and
day / There is also in Irlonde a place called saint patryks purgatory / which
place is perilous if any men goon therein and be not confessed and repentaunt
of their sins / They be anon rauysshyd and lost in such wise that noman can
tell where they be come / And if they be confessyd and repentant / and that
they have don satisfaccion and penance for their sins / without that all be
cleansed and full satisfied / thereafter shall they suffer pain and greef the
tormentis in passing this crymynel passage / And when he is returned again fro
this purgatory / Never shall no thing in this world plese him that he shall see
ner he shall never be Joyous ne gladne shall not be seen lawhe / but shall be
continuelly in wayllynges and wepinges for the sins that he has commysed /
hit may well be that of ancient time it has been thus as a sore is wreton as
the storye of Tu^dale and other witness / but I have spoken with diverse men
that have been therein / And that one of them was an hye chanon of waterford
which told me that he had been therein.v. or.vj. times / And he saw ne suffered
no such things / he says that with procession the Relygious men that been
there bring him in to the hool and shette the door after him / and than he
walks groping in to it / where as he said ben places and manner of cowches to
rest on / And there he was all the night in contemp^^cion and prayer / and
also slepte there / and on the morn he came out again / ^^her while in their
sheep sum men have meruayllous dremes and other thing saw he not / And in
like wise told to me a worshipful knight of beuggis named sir Ioh^n de banste
that he had been therein in like wise and see none other thing but as before is
said / In beytaygne that now is called England as is said is a fontayne and a
pyler or a perron thereby And when men take water of this well and cast it
upon the perron / Anon it begins to rain and blow / th^ndre and lyghtne
meruayllously Also in ffraunce has been s^en sometime a manner of people that have
be horned / Toward the mountes of mount Ius ye shall find plente of wymmen that
have botches under the chyn^ / which hang down of sum down to the pappes /
and they that have grettest ben holden for fairest / Other folk there ben that
have botches on their backs and ben crooked as crochettes / And they that see
all thise things often / meruaylle but lytyl / also it is often seen that in
this contre ben born children deef and dombe / and also of them that have both
nature of man and woman / yet ben there often seen sum children comen in to
this world sum without hands and sum without arms /

Of the manner and condition of beestes of thise contrees capitulo xvo
THe fox is of such a condition that when he departs fro the wode and gooth
in to the feldes / there he lies down and stratcheth him on the ground as he
were deed for to take birds / when the heart will renew his age he eteth of
some venymous beeste / if the tode Crapault or spyncop byte a man or woman /
they be in danger for to dye / it has be often scen / The spyttle of a man
fasting sleeth comynly the spyncoppe and the tode if it touch them if a wulf
and a man see that one that other fro far / he that is first seen becomes
anon aferd The wulf bears the sheep without hurtynge or gr^uyng / of him
doubtyng that he would cry / and that he should not be followed / and after
deuoureth him when he has brought him to the wode / and if he be constrained
to leave him in his berynge He destrayneth him with all his might at his
departing The spyther or spyncop of his propre nature spynneth and weueth of
his entraylles the threde / of which he makes his nets for to take flies
which he eteth / when the sheape has two whelps or fawnes she loves that
one much better than that other / She berith him that she loves best in her
arms / And that other she leteth goo / which when she is hunted lepeth on the
moders back and holds her fast / And that other that she bears in her
arms / she beteth fall and is often constrained to save her self / also it is
so that the hounde keeps the goods of his lord and maistre / and ben by him
waranted against men and bestes And above all other he knows his lord and
maistre by his smellyng / and loves him of so right good love that often it
happeth be it right or wrong he will not forsake his maistre unto the death /
And also is so sorrowful for the death of his maistre / that otherwhyle he loses
his life / In england in some place is there a manner of hounds that goon and
seche out the theuys / and bryngen them fro thens where they fond them / The
moustele is a right lytil best and sleeth the basilycock / and in long
fyghtyng byteth him out of mesure She of her nature remeueth so often her fawnes
fro one place to another that with great pain they may uneath be founden /
The hyrchon when he fyndeth apples beten or blown down of a tree / he waloweth
on them till he be chargid and laden with the fruit stykyng on his pryckes / And
when he feleth him self laden as much as he may bear he goth his way with them
syngyng and making his deduyt / And if he mete any best that would do him
harm / he reduyseth him self as round as a bowl / and hydeth his groyne and
his feet / and armeth him with his pryckes about his skin in such wise that
no best dar approach him doubtyng his pryckes / The lamb which never saw
wulf / of his propre nature doubts and fle^th him / But he doubts nothing
other bestes but goth hardyly emonge them /

Of the manner of birds of thise forsaid contrees. ca. xvjo
THe Egle of his nature takes his birds by the vngles or cla^es with his
bylle / And him that holds fastest (...) best and keeps them next by him /
And them that holden but febly / he leteth hem goo / and takes none head of
them / when the Egle is much aged he flees so hye that he passes the clouds
/ And holds there his sight so long against the son / that he has al lost
it and brende all his feathers / Then he falls down on a montaygne in a
water that he has to fore chosen / and in this manner he renews his life /
And when his bille is ouerlonge he breketh and bruseth it against an hard stone
and sharpeth it / when the Turtle has lost her make whom she has first
known / Never after will she have make / ne sytte upon grene tree / But flees
emonge the trees contynuelly bewayllyng her love / The hostryche by his nature
eteth well iron / and greueth him not / when the heyron sees the tempest come
/ he flees up so hye till he be above the clouds for teschewe the rayn and
tempeste / The Chowe when she fyndeth gold or silver / of her nature she hydeth
and bears it away / And who sometime heereth her voys / it seems proprely that
she speaks / The crow weneth that he is the fairest bird of all other / and
the best syngyng / if her birds be white in any part / she will never do
them good til they be all black / The pecok when he beholds his feathers he
sets up his tayll as Round as a wheel al about him / by cause his beaulte
should be allowed and preysed / and is much proud of his fair feathers and
plumage / But when he beholds toward his feet / which ben fowl to look on /
then he leteth his tayll fall wenyng to cover his feet / The goshawke and
sperhawk taken their prays by the ryuers / But they that been tame and
reclaymed being that they take to their lord which has so taught them The
culuer or the dowue is a simple bird / and of her nature nourisshith well the
pigeons of another douue / And apperceyuith well in the water by thy shadow
and sees therein when the hawke would take her / The huppe or lapwynche is a
bird crested / which is much in mareys and fylthes / and abides lever
therein than out thereof / who someuer ennoynteth him self with the blood of the
huppe / and hap that after leyde him down to sleep him should seem anon in his
sleep dremyng that all the deuyllis of hell should come to him and would
strangle him / The nyghtyngal of her propre nature syngeth well and long / and
otherwhyle so long that she deyeth syngyng / And the lark in like wise dies
often singyng / The swanne syngeth often to fore her death / In like wise do often
many men / Of thise things and of many other / much people meruaylle that
never herd of such things to fore / ne know not thereof as we do here that
daily find it / ffor in this book we find many things and resons / whereof
men meruaylle strongly that never have seen. learned. ne herd of them /

Of dyuersytes of sum comyne things. ca. xvijo
PLente and many things there ben seen at eye / of which the resons ben
couuert and hyd fro us / of which the people meruaylle but lytil / because
they see it so often / The quyck silver is of such nature and manner that it
susteyneth a stone upon it / where as water and oil may not / ffor the stone
in them gooth to the bottom / The lyme or brent chalk / in cold water anon it
chauffeth and is hoot that noman may suffer his hand on it / The rays of the
son make the here of a man abourne or blounde / And it makes the flessh^ of
a man broun or black / And it whiteth the lynnen cloth / And the earth that is
moist and soft / makes dry and hard / and wax that is dry / it relenteth
and makes soft / Also it makes cold water in a vessel warm / Also out of
glass against the son men make fire / and out of Crystal in like wise / also
with smytyng of a stone against iron comes fire / and flammeth / The b^eeth of
a man which is hoot coleth hoot thing / And it chauffeth cold / and air / by
meuyng / The earth which is peysant and right heavy by nature holds hit in
the myddle of thaye^ without piler and foundement only by nature / And therefore
he is a fool that meruaylleth of things that god makes / ffor no creature
has the power to show reason wherefore they ben or not / ffor there is nothing
how lytil it be / that the gloss may be known unto the truth sauf only that
which pleseth to our lord god / ffor to be well founded in clergy may men
know and understand the reason of so^me things / and also by nature such
thing as by reason can not be comprehended / Thawh a man inquire never so long
of that is wrought in therthe by nature / he shall not mow come to the
knowelege wherefore ne how they be made / This may noman certainly know / sauf
god only which knows the reason and understands it /

ffor to know where hell stondeth / and what thing it is / capitulo xviijo
WE have declared to you and devised the earth without forth the best wise that
we can / But now it is expedyent after that this that is said to know and
inquire what places and what mansions there may be within therthe / and whether
it be paradys / hell. purgatory. lymbo or other thing / And which of them
is best / and which of them all is worste / As to the regard of me and as me
seems / that / that which is enfermed and closed in the earth is hell / I
say this for as much as hell may in no wise be in thayer which is one so
noble a place / Also I may freely mayntene that it is not in heaven / ffor that
place is so right excellent pure and net / that hell may not endure there /
ffor as much as hell is so horrible. stynkyng. fowl. and obscure / Also it is
more poysau^t and heavy than any thing may be / wherefore it may be clerly
understood that hell has his being in the most lowest place. most derke.
and most vile of the earth / And as I have here said to you the causes why /
In truth it may not be in thayer / and yet less in heaven / ffor it is in
all points contrary to heaven above / ffor as much as thise two ben
contrary one to another / Of which places in that one is founden but all
glory and consolacion / that is heaven / In that other is nothing but of all
tribulacion / that is hell / And therefore it is withdrawn all under fro that
other as far as it may / and that is in the myddle of therthe / I say not
that hell is not in none other place where it be / ffor after the death he has
pain and sorrow that has deserved it / And when such one shall have his pain
above / so much has he the werse All thus as it should be of sum man that
had a great maladye so much that he should deye / And that he were brought in
to a fair place and plesaunt for to have Joy and solace / of so much should he
be more heavy and sorrowful when he saw that he could ne might help him self ne
take thereby no spoort ne releef / In like wise shall it be of thise unhappy
caytifs that been by their demerites dampened in hell / whereof we shall now
herafter to you more ample and largely declare / ffor to fynysshe the bettre
our book / Now if ye will take heed and understand / we shall deuyse how
hell is in the myddle of therthe / and of what nature it is of / And of the
inestymable tormentis which they have that been therein put and condemned / ye
have well understood how by nature the iiij elements hold them / that one
within that other / so that therthe is in the myddle and holds him in the
myddle of the firmament all in like wise is there in the myddle of therthe a
place which is called Abisme or swolowe / and earth of perdicion / Thus much
say I to you of this place that it is full of fire and of brennyng sulfre / And
it is over h^ydows stynkynge. full of ordure and of all evil adventure / hit is
much large within / and bynethe it is strayt / All that falls therein anon
the sulphre contynuelly brenneth destroys and consumes / And that thing tha^
comes therein shall never fynysshe ne have end / but alleway shall brenne
without end / Alleway it brenneth / and alleway renews / And all that come
therein may never deye / ffor this place is of such nature that the more it
brenneth / the longer it endures / This place of hell has within him all
the euylles of his party / There death holds his standard / which sends
out through all the world for to fetch them that been his / who that has Joy
of heaviness Thither come all euylles and all the evil apportes / this place is
called the earth of death / ffor the sowles that been brought thither / they abide
and dwell there without end / Certainly they deye living / And alleway live
deyeng / The death is there their life and their vyande and mete / The death
holds them there at his commandment This is the right pytte of fire that
brennyth / and all in like wise as the stone is drowned in the sea when it is
thrown and sonken / and never shall be after seen / right so ben the sowles
sonken in to the bottom which contynuelly brenne and be drowned there / But
for all that they dymynysshe not ne have end / but in such myserye abye their
folyes night and day / and so shall endure perpetuelly and without end / ffor
what someuer thing that is spyrituel may never dye* in such wise that it be
all deed / but the death would they have and weesshe after it incessantly / the
soul may never deye after that it is out of the body / but when it is there /
it shall alleway languysshe / And ever after that it is in hell / it shall have
nothing but evil / this is the contre and the land of oblyuion and forgetyng
/ ffor all they that been there shall be forgoten / like as they forgate in this
world their maker which is full of pity and of mysericorde / And therefore he
has leyd them there in forgetyng where they shall never have mercy ne pardon /
in this land so tenebrouse hydouse and full of all stenche / and of sorrows.
anguysshes. heaviness. hungre. and thyrste shall never creature have gladness ne
Joy Thise ben the terryble gehynes stynkynge / And there is the fire so over
much ardau^t ho^e and anguysshous that our fire and the hete is no more unto
the regard of that fire of hell / than a fire painted on a wall is in
comparison and to the regard of our fire / There ben the flodes peryllous
which ben of fire and of ice so hydows. horrible. full of venyme and of foul
beestes that make so great noise and so great grief pain and ennoye unto the
dolorouse sowles that been in the said abysme / that there nys creature that can
or may recounte or tell the hundred part / In this contre there is plente of
other places which ben peryllous and horrible / And of them ben sum in the sea as well as within therthe / In many yles that been by the sea is terryble
stenche of sulphre ardaunt in great fire which is much paynfull / There ben
many great montaynes of sulphre that brenne night and day where as many sowles
ben encombred and brenne contynuelly for to purge their sins and inyquytees /
This may then well suffyse as touching to speak any more of this matere /
ffor there is no creature that can tell the great torments and inestymable
pains that a man of evil life receives for his demerites when he is departed
fro this world / ffor he goth eu from evil to werse / here we shall cesse for
this present time / and now say no more hereof / And seen that we have spoken
well a long of one of the four Elements / which is therthe / we shall now
speak of the second / and that is of the water that always renneth / and after
we shall speak of thayer / and after of the fire / euerich in his right order /

How the watre renneth by and through therthe. ca. xixo
THe water / that is the deep see the which enuyronneth and goth round about
the world / and of this see / meuen all the flodes and Ryuers that run
through the earth / And run so far their course / and that they return and
come again thedyr from whens they departed / and that is the Sea / And thus
gooth the Sea contynuelly tornyng and making his course that for so much as the
water is more light than the earth / so much is it above and is most next to
therthe / She departs and deuydeth the contrees / and she spredeth her
thurghout. all therthe. / she falls again in to the Sea / and spredeth again
by the flodes and Ryuers and goth sourdyng and spryngyng in the earth from one
place to another by veins / all in like wise as the blood of a man gooth and
renneth by the veins of the body / and gooth out and yssueth in so^me place /
all in like wise renneth the water by the veins of therthe and sourdeth and
spryngeth out by the fontaynes and wells / fro which it gooth al about /
that when one delueth in therthe deep in medowe or in montaygne or in valeye
men find water salt or sweet or of so^me other manner /

How the water sweet or salt. hoot or enuenymed sourdeth out of the earth
capitulo xxo
All watres come of the sea as well the sweet as the salt / what someuer they
be / all come out of the sea / and theder again all return / whereupon sum
may demand^ / sith the sea is salt / how is it that sum water is fresshe and
sweet / Herto answerth one of thauctours and says that the water that has his
course by the sweet earth is fresshe and sweet / and becomes sweet by the
swetnes of therthe / which takes away from it his saltnes and his bytternes
by her nature / ffor the water which is salt and bitter when it renneth through
the sweet earth / the swetnes of therthe reteyneth his bytternes and saltnes /
And thus becomes the water sweet and fresshe which to fore was salt and
byttre / Other waters sourden and spryngen bitter and black / which sum men
drink for to be heled of their maladyes instead of poison / the which
oftymes make great purgacions to sum people / This is a water that spryngeth
black and clear and renneth in therthe which is bitter and black / and it is
full of much fylthe / wherefore men have great meruaylle / how it may be holsom
to the body of a man / In another place sourdeth water which is hoot / and
that there might be scalded therein a pygge or ghoos / which ben called bathes
or baynes naturell / Of such manner bathes ben there in Almayne in the Cite of
Acon / and in England at bathe / In lorayne another at thabbay of plounners /
And at Ays in Gascoygne another / This proceeds for as much as within therthe
ben many caves which ben hoot and brennyng as fire / And therthe has plente
of veins which ben all full of sulphre / And there comes other while a wind
great and strong the which comes by the water that sourdeth / And that is
put forth so strongly that the sulphre catches fire and brenneth / like as a
fornayce all brennyng should do / And the water that has his course by these
veins become also hoot as fire / And if it happed that the water right there /
should spring out of therthe / it should issue sourdyng all enflamed and all
boylyng as it were on a fire / But fro as far as his course renneth fro thens
so much wexeth it less hoot and less brennyng / and it may run so long
and so far / that in the end it becomes again all cold / ffor there is
nothing so hoot but that it koleth / sauf only the fire of hell which
contynuelly brenneth / and shall brenne without end / within therthe is plente
of other places which ben full of foul bestes and venymous / in such wise
that the water that renneth thereby is all enfected and sourdeth in sum
places on therthe / but who that drynketh thereof secheth his death /

Of diverse fontaynes and wells that sourde on therthe / capitulo xxjo
There ben plente of fontaynes in other places that much often change their
color / and other of whom come miracles / but it is not well known whereof this
proceeds / In the land of Samarye is a well that changes and differenceth
his color four times in the year / hit is first grene / and after it changes
in to Sangwynne and after it becomes trowble / and after all this it becomes
clear. net. and right fine / in such wise that men delight them in beholding
of it / but no person dar drink of it / In this party is yet another
fontayne which spryngeth three or four days the weke good and holsomme / And
the other three days it spryngeth not / but is all dry / There is also a great
River that renneth six days during in the weke / And on the sabotte day it
renneth not / ffor as soon as the sabbotte day approaches / he rebouteth and
goth in to therthe again / By Acres the Cite is founden a manner of sand / and
there is founden also of the glayre of the sea / which ben meddled to gydre /
And of these two myxtyons is made good glass and clear / In Egypt is the read
see / where the children of Israhel passed over dry foot for to come in to
the land of byheste / This see takes his name of therthe / ffor therthe is
all read in the bottom and on the sides in such wise that the water of this
see seems all reed / In Perse is a river long and brood which in the night
is so hard frozen / that people may goo over afoot and trauerse it / And on day
time it is clear and rennyng / There is in Espyre a well of which the nature
is much meruayllous the which quenches brondes of fire all brennyng / and
after it sets them a fire again In ethiope is another which by night has
so great hete that no creature may then drink thereof / And all the day it
is so cold that it is frorn all hard / In lorayne nygh^ unto metz the cite
is a water that renneth there / the which is soden in great payelles of copper
/ and it becomes salt fair and good / And this water furnyssheeth all the
contre of salt / And this water sourdeth of a ^itte which is called the pytte
of dauyd / In this contre ben other fontaynes that been so hoot that it brenneth
all that it touches / In the same place sourde and spring other that been as
cold as ice / There been baynes well attemprid and medlid with cold water and
hoot / And they that bayne them in thise baynes / their scabbes and soores
become all hool / yet there be of other fontaynes right black / which ben
holden right holsom / and people drink of them instead of medecynes / and they
make oftymes great purgacions / and gretter than of a medycyne or a laxatyf /
Another fontayne there is toward the Oryent whereof is made fire grekyssh with
other myxtyons that is put thereto the which fire when it is taken and light is
so hoot / that it can not be quenchid with water / but with aysel. vryne. or
with sonde only / the sarasyns selle this water right dear and derrer than they
do good wine / Other fontaynes sourde in many other places that hele sore eyes
and many soores and wounds / Other fontaynes there be that render to a man his
mind and memory / Other make men to forgete Other that refrain people fro
lecherye Other that meue them thereto / Other there be that make wymmen to
conceive and bear children / And other that make them bareyne. and may bear
none / There ben sum ryuers that make sheep black / and other that make them
white as the lylye / On that other side there ben many pondes or stagnes in
which may nothing swymme man ne hou^de ne other beeste but anon it synketh
down to the bottom / There ben other in which nothing may synke / but
contynuelly flote above / There ben yet other fontaynes hoot / that blind the
thieves when they forswere them of the trespaas that they have commysed touching
their theft / And if they be charged and born wrongly on hand without reason
and then drink of this water / certainly they shall have better sight than to
fore / Of all thise things can noman render the reason / but that we ought to
understand that all this proceeds by miracle / yet ben there other fontaynes
which ben stylle and clear / which that when men pleye over them with harp
or other instrumentis that resowne in manner of consolacion by their sown / the
water of those wellis spring up with great bobles and spring over in the way
/ Other fontaynes ben in other places which ben right peryllous / but for this
present we shall rest herwith all / ffor to tell of this that comes by the
waters / which hold their-cours within therthe and also above / of which it
happeth other while so great a quauyng that the earth meueth so strongly / that
it behooves to fall all that which is thereon / thaugh it were a massyue tour
/

Wherefore and how the earth quaueth and trembles. ca. xxijo
NOw understand ye then / what it is of the me^uyng of the earth / and how
the earth quaueth and shakes that sum people call an earth quaue / by cause
they feel therthe meue and quaue under their feet / And oftymes it quaueth so
terrybly and meueth that sometime Cytees ben sonken in to therthe that never
after be scen / And this comes of the great waters that come within therthe /
so that by the puttyng out of the great floodes and waters grow sum time
cauernes under therthe / And the air that is shette fast within / the which
is enclosed in great distress / if therthe be there feeble so that it may not
reteyne it all within / then is it constrained to opene and cleue / ffor the
air enforces to issue out / whereof it happeth often that towns cytees and
castellys ben sonken down in to the abisme / And if therthe be of such force
and strength that it opens not ne cleueth by the shouyng or heuyng of the
wyndes that been within / Then therthe meueth and quaueth so meruayllously /
that the great walls and hye towers that been thereon fall down so suddenly in
therthe that it destroys and sleeth the people that been therein which ben not
aduysed ne pourueyed of such dangers / which is a great sorrow for the pour
people that dwell where such meschief happeth / when they be not aduertysed at
what time such tempeste shall come for teschewe it / but wise men that doubt
for to deye arm them and make them ready against the death / and give all
diligence for to seche to have accordaunce unto the souerayn judge / of their
sins and defaultes after their law and believe that they have / as they that
have none hour ne space to live where as they ben hool and weel at case / thus
the water and the wind maken the right meuyng and quauyng by which the earth
cleueth and quaueth /

How the water of the sea becomes salt / capitulo xxiijo
NOw I will recounte and tell to you how the water of the sea becomes salt /
which is so bittre that no person may drink ne the beestis in like wise /
hit comes by the son on hye / ffor it makes so great hete in sum place /
that the sea is chauffed so strongly that therthe which is under draws to
him a moisture bittre / which takes away all his savor / ffor in the sea ben
right great and hye montaynes / and deep valeyes which ben full of bitternesses
grievous and infected / And the earth which is in the bottom of thise valeyes
scumeth for the heete of the son upward / which medleth with the water in
the deep in such wise that it draws the saltnes up by the hete of the son
/ so long til it be medlyd with that other / And thus is the water of the sea
salt with that other Then we shall here fynysshe to speak any more of the
watres fressh or salt / And shall recounte to you of the Air which is one of
the iiij Elementis and of his propretees /

Here follows of the Air and of his nature. ca. xxiiijo
THe Air is set above the water / and is much more subtyl than the water or
the earth / and enuyronneth therthe on all parties / and domyneth also hye as
the clouds mount / This Air which enuyronneth us on all sides is much
thycke / But we live thereby / in like wise as the fysshe lives by the water /
which he d^aweth in / and after casts it out again / In such manner the air
prouffyteth to us / ffor we draw it in / and after we put it out / and thus it
holds the life within the body ffor a man should sonner deye without Air /
than a fysshe should do without water / to whom alleway the life is sone
fynysshyd when it is out of the water / Thayer maynteneth in us the life / by
the moisture that is in him / And by the thycknes that is in him he susteyneth
the birds fleeyng that so play with their wings and meue them so much al
about therein that they disporte them ledyng their Joy therein and their deduyt
/ Thus goon the birds by thayer fleyng. syngyng and preysyng their maker and
creator / like as the fysshes that goon swimming in the water / and ye may
apperceyue in this manner / take a rod and meue it in thayer / and if ye meue
it fast and roydly it shall bow anon / And if it fond not thayer thycke / it
should not bow ne ploye / but should hold him straight and right / how fast
someuer ye meued it / Of this Air the evil esperites take their habyte and
their bodies / which in sometime put them in the semblaunce of so^me things as
when they may appear in some place for to deceive some person man or woman / or
for to make them to issue out of their mind / whereof they have sometime the
might / Or when by the art of nygromancye he puts him in so^me semblaunce
or in such a figure as he will / But this is a science that who that geuyth
him thereto to do evil / hit gives him the death / ffor if he takes not head
thereof / he shall be dampened body and soul / But we shall inquire here after /
what comes fro thayer in to therthe /

How the clouds and rayn come comynly. ca. xxvo
NOw we shall speak of the clouds for to know what it is and of the Rain also
/ The son is the foundement of all hete and of all time / all in such wise
/ as the heart of a man is the foundement by his valor that is in him of all
natural hete / ffor by him he has life / and all lives by him that grows on
therthe as it pleseth to our lord / as here after shall be declared / if ye will
here and well reteyne the matter and substance of this present book / ffor the
son makes the clouds to mount on hye / and after it makes the Rain and
to auale down / And I shall show to you how it is done and shortly / by his
force / And understand ye in what manner / when the son spredeth his rays
upon therthe and upon the mareys / he dreyeth them strongly / And draws up
the moisture which he enhaunseth on hye / But this is a moisture subtyl which
appears but lytyl and is named vapor / and it mounteth unto the myddle of
thayer and there it assembleth and comes to gydre and abides there / And
lytil and lytil it encreceth that it comes thycke and derke in such wise that
it takes fro us the sight of the son / And this thing is the cloud / But
it has not so much obscur^te that it takes fro us the clernes of the day /
And when it grows over thycke it becomes water which falls on the earth /
and the cloud abides white / then shyneth the son / which is on hye
through the cloud / if it be not over black / like as through a glass / And
also like a candel within a laterne / which gives us light without forth /
and yet we see not the candel / thus shyneth the son through the cloud which
is under him and renders to us the clerenesse of the day / as long as he
makes his turn above therthe / And the cloud that always so long abides
and takes more moisture / so long after / that it becomes black and moist /
then yssueth out the water which comes to therthe / and thus grows the
rain / And when it is all fallen to therthe / and the great moisture is
staunched the cloud has lost his broun color that he before held and the
derknesse of which she empesshid the day / Then apperith the cloud clear
and white which then is light and monuteth on hye somoche that in the end she
faylleth and is deffeted by the hete of the son on hye which all dreyeth up
/ Then thayer wexeth again pure and clear / and the heaven as blew as Azure /
Of therthe grows the rayn and the clouds also / as of a cloth that is went /
and should be dreyd by the fire / then yssueth thereof a moisture like a smoke
or fumee and goth upward / who then held his hand over this fumee / he
should feel a vapor which should make his hand moist and weet / if it dured
long he should appertly know that his hand were all weet / and that water
should drop and fall thereof / And thus I say to you that in this manner grow
often the clouds and raynes And our lord god multeplieth well them when it
pleseth^ him for to make the seeds and fruytes grow that been on therthe /

Of ffrostes and snowes / capitulo xxvjo
THe great snowes and the great frostes comen by the great coldes of thayer
which is cold in the myddle more than it is on any other part / like as ye
may see of the montaynes which ben in hye place / like as the montaynes of
sauoye. of pyemont. or in wales / and in thise other montaynes / where there is
of custom more snow / than is in places that been in plain ground / All this
comes of the coldness of thayer / which has less hete above / than bynethe /
by cause it is more subtyl / than that which is bynethe / And when the more
subtyl is on hye / so much reteyneth he less of hete / But the more that
thayer is thycke somoche more it chauffeth / and the sonner where the son may
come / Of which comes that iron and steel weep more hoot by the son than
does the stone / ffor of so much as the thing is more hard and of more thyck
matter / so much takes it the fire more asprely and sonner than they that been
of less force / Thus say I to you of thayer that is above on hye / which is
more cold than this is bynethe / ffor as much as it is not so thycke as that
is which is nygh^e therthe / And for the wind that often grows / which
makes it often to be in meuyng / ffor the water that renneth fast eschauffeth
lass^ than that does that holds him stylle / So does thayer which is on hye
/ And thereby grows the cold that freseth this moisture anon as it is goon up
on hye / And falls down again y frorn /

Of haylle and of tempests capitulo xxvijo
BY this manner come^ in the somer the great haylles and the great tempests /
ffor in thayer they grow / whereof oftyme comes great cold / so that the
moisture that is in thayer brought up / is drawn to be froen / and it is in
thayer assembled and amassed / ffor the hete that chaceth after it / And the
son causes it to lose and to fall on therthe / But it falls not so great
to the ground as it is frorn above on hye / ffor it comes down brekyng and
amenuysyng in the falling / And this is the tempeste which falls often in the
somer / the which is grievous and ennoyous to many things /

Of lyghtnynges and of thonders capitulo xxviijo
IN thayer happen many things / of which the people speak not gladly / ffor
they retche not much of such things of which they can not well come to the
knowleche / This that makes therthe to quaue / and this that makes the
clouds to thondre / that which makes the earth to opene / and this that
makes the clouds to sparkle and lyghtne when the thondre is herd / ffor
thondres and lyghtnynges ben deboutemens and brekyng out of wyndes that mete
above the clouds so asprely and sharply / that in their coming grows often a
great fire in thayr / and this thondre that falls in many places which the
wyndes constrayne so terrybly that the clouds cleue and break and makes to
thondre and lyghtne and falls down in so great rage by the wind that
destrayneth it so asprely that it confounds all that it atteyneth in such
wise that nothing endures against it / And it is of so heavy nature that sometime
it perseth therthe unto the myddle / And sometime it quenches er it comes to
the ground after that it is of poyse / and that is not of over strong nature
/ ffor when the cloud is much derke and thycke / and that there is great
plente of water / the fire passes not so soon / but it is quenchid in the
cloud by the great quantyte of the water that is therein before it may perse
through so that it may not approach therthe / but in the straynyng and brekyng
that hit makes then in the cloud / grows a sown so great and strong /
that it is merueyllous to here I declare to you for certain that this is the
thondre / which is much to be doubted and drad / In like wise as of an hoot
and brennyng iron that is put in a tubbe of water / thereof grows a noise and
a great sown / and also when cooles ben quenchid / But the lyghtnyng of the
thondre appears and is seen er ye here the voys or sown / ffor as much as
the sight of a man is more subtyl than the heerynge / like as men see fro far
over a water betyng of clothes or smiting of marteaulx or hamers / the strokes
ben seen of them that smite / or the so^^ be herd of the stroke / All in like
wise may I say to you of the thondre / the which men see to fore and er they
here it / And so much the ferther it is above us / so much the ferther is the
soun of the lyghtnyng after it is seen / er the soun be herd / And the sonner
after the lyghtnyng is seen and the noys herd / somoche is the thondre more
nyghe unto us /

For to know how the wyndes grow and come. ca. xxixo
OF the wyndes may men inquire reason of them that use the sees / And the wyndes
run round about therthe oftymes / and entrecounte and mete in some place so
asprely / that they rise upon heyght in such wise that they lift up thayer on
hye / And thayer that is so lift and taken fro his place / remeueth other air
in such facion that it retorneth as it were afterward / and gooth cryeng and ^
brayeng as water rennyng / ffor wind is none other thing but air that is
meuyd so long / till his force be beten down with the stroke / Thus come often
clouds raynes thondres and lyghtnynges / and the things tofore said / There
ben yet other resons how these works comen / But thise that best serve to
knowelege and lygtly to be understand / we have drawn out shortly / And now
shall cesse of this matter for to speak of the fire which is above the air on
hye /

Of the fire and of the sterres that seem to fall. ca. xxxo
YE ought to know that above thayer is the fire / this is an air which is of
much great resplendour and shynyng and of much great noblesse / and by his
right great subtylte he has no moisture in him / And is much more clear than
the fire that we use / and of more subtyl nature / than thayer is against the
water / or also the water against the earth / This air in which is no manner
moisture / it stratch^th unto the moon / And there is seen often under this air
sum sparkles of fire / and seem that they were sterres of which men say
they be sterres / which goon rennyng / and that they remeue fro their places /
But they be none / but it is a manner of fire that grows in thayer of sum
dry vapor / which has no moisture within it / which is of therthe and
thereof grows by the son which draws it upon hye / and when it is over
hye / it falls and is set a fire like as a candel brennyng as us seems /
and after falls in thayer moist and there is quenchid by the moistnes of
thayer / And when it is great and the air dry it comes al bre^nyng unto
therthe / whereof it happeth often that they that saylle by the sea or they that
goon by land have many times fou^den and seen them al shynyng and brenning
fall unto therthe / and when they come where it is fallen they find none
other thing but a litil ashes or like thing or like some leef of a tree roten /
that were weet / Then apperceyue they well and believe that it is no sterre /
ffor the sterres may not fall / but they must all in their cercle meue
ordynatly and contynuelly night and day egally /

Of the pure Air and how the seven planetes ben set / capitulo xxxjo
THe pure air is above the fire / which pourpriseth and takes his place unto
the heaven / In this air is no obscurte ne derknes / ffor it was made of clean
purete it resplendissheth and shyneth so clerly that it may to nothing be
compared / in this air ben vij sterres which make their course al about
therthe / the which be much clean and clear and be named ye vij planetes / of
whom that one is set above that other / and in such wise ordained that there
is more space fro that one to that other / than there is fro the earth to the moon / which is ferther fyften times than all the the earth is great / and
euerich renneth by miracle on the firmament and makes his cercle that one
great and that other lytil after that it is and sits more low / ffor of
somoche that it makes his course more nyghe therthe / so much is it more short
/ and sonner has performed his course / than that which is ferthest / that is
to say that who that made a point in a wall / and with a compaas made diverse
cercles about / always that one more large than another / That which should be
next the poyn^ should be lest of the other / and less should be his course /
ffor he should sonner have don his course than the grettest / so that they went
both egally as ye may see by this figure to fore /

THus may ye understand of the vij planetes of which I have spoken that that
one is under that other / in such wise that she that is lowest of all the
other is leest of all and that is the moon / But by cause that it is next to
therthe / it seems grettest and most apparaunt of all the other / and for
thapprochement of therthe / and by cause it goth so nygh / it has no pure
cler^nes that comes of him self proprely / by cause therthe is so obscure /
But the clernes and light that it renders to us / she takes always of the
son / like as should a myrrour when the rays of the son smyteth therein /
and of the reflection ye myrrour smyteth on the wall and shyneth thereon as
long as the rays of the son endure in the glass / in like manner shows
and lyghteth to us the light of the moon / and in the moon is a body polysshyd
and fair like a pommell right well burnysshed / which reflaumbeth and rendrith
light and clerenes when the rays of the son smyteth therein / The lytil
clouds or derkenes that is seen therein / so^me say that it is therthe that
appears within / And that which is water appears white / like as against a
myrrour which receives diverse colors / when she is turned thereto / Other
think otherwise and say that hit happed and byfelle when Adam was deceived by
thapple that he ete / which gr^u^d all humayne lignage / And that then the
m^ne was empesshed and his clerenesse lassed and mynuysshid / Of thise vij
sterres or planetes that been there and ma^^ their course on the firmament of
whom we have here to fore spoken / ffirst were no moo known but the tweyne /
that is to wete the son and the moon / the other were not known but by
Astronomye / Nevertheless yet shall I name them for as we have spoken of them to
you / Of these there ben tweyne above the moon and byneth the son / and that
one above that other of whom / each has on therth propre virtues / And they be
named Mercury and Venus / Then above the moon and thise tweyne / is the
son / which is so clear fair and pure / that it renders light and
clerenesse unto all the world / and the son is set so hye above / that his
cercle is gretter and more spa^youse than the cercle of the moon / which
makes his course in xxx days / xij sithes somoche / ffor the son which
gooth more ferther fro the earth / than ye moan makes his course / has CCC lxv
days / this is xij times somoche and more over as the calender enseigneth /
and yet more the fourth part of a day / that be vj hours / but for this that
ye year has dyusly his beginning / that one begins on ye day / and another
on the night / which is great ennoye to much people / this fourth part of a
day is set by cause alleway in four year is a day consumed / which is above
in that space / the which year is named bysexte or lepe year / which in iiij
year falls ones / and so is set fro four year to four year always more a
day / And then is the son comen again in his first point / And that is in
myd march / when the new time recomenceth / And that all things draw to
love by the virtue of the return of the Son / ffor in this season had the
world first his beginning / and therefore then all thing renews and comes
in verdure by right nature / of the time and none otherwise / Above the son
there be three sterres clear and shynyng / and one above another / That is to
wete Mars Jupiter and Saturnus / Saturn is highest of the seven which has in
his course xxx year er he has all goon his cerkle / and these iij sterres
reteyne their virtues in things here bynethe / and ye may see if ye behold
this figure how they be in order each above other / which figure shows it
well /

How the vij planetes give the names to the vij days capitulo xxxijo
THise seven planetes ben such that they have power on things that grow on
therthe / and habounde their virtues more than all the other that been on the
firmament / and more appertly work / like as thauncyent sage philosophres have
enserched by their wits / of thise seven planetes taken the days of the weke
their names / as ye shall here / The moon has the monday / And mars the
tewsday / Mercurye the wednesday / Jupiter the thursday / Venus the vryday /
Saturnus the saturday / And the holy sunday has his name of the Son / which
is the most fair / And therefore the sunday is better than any of the other days
of the weke / ffor this day is set and reseruyd from all pain and labor /
And on this day should men do thing that should playse our lord / But sith in
this chapter we have touched of the firmament / we shall speak after of sum
caas that come on the heaven and therthe* / The sunday is as much to say as
the day of pees and of praysynge / ffor the creator of all things cessed
this day / the which made and created all /

Of the meuyng and gooyng about of the ffyrmament and of the sterres that been
therein capitulo xxxiijo
Above saturn which is the last planest / and highest from us of all the vij
planetes is the heaven that men see so full of sterres as it were sown / when
it is clear time and weder / This heaven that is so sterred is the firmament /
which meueth and goth round / of which meuyng is so great Joy / so great
melodye and so sweet / that there is noman that if he might here it / that never
after should have talente ne will to do thing that were contrary unto our
lord in any thing that might be / so much should he desire to come theder /
where he might alleway here so sweet melodyes and be always with them / whereof
sum were sometime that said that lytil young children herd this melodye when
they lawghed in their sleep / ffor it is said that then they here the Angels
of our lord in heaven sing whereof they have such Joy in their sleep / But
hereof knows noman the truth sauf god that knows all / which setted the
sterres on the heaven and made them to have such power / ffor there is nothing
withyn the earth ne withyn the sea. how diverse it be / but it is on the heaven
fygured and compassed by the sterres / of which none knows the nombre sauf
god only / which at his ^ playsir nombreth them and knows the name of
eueriche of them as he that all knows and all created by good reason / at
the regard of the sterres that may be seen / they may be well nombred and
inquired by Astronomye / but it is a much maistryse / ffor there ne is sterreso
lytil / but that it has in him hole his virtue / in herb / in flour / or in
fruit be it in facion / in color or otherwise / There is nothing in earth that
ought to be / ne therein has growyng but sum sterre has strength and
puissaunce by nature / is it good or otherwise such as god has given to it /
And for the firmament and for the planetes take this figure to fore an that
other side / and ye shall see therein the sytuacion of them /

But sith we have descriued and spoken of the firmament in this second party
of this volume / we shall speak of sum caases that come and happen on hye and
also low / And shall speak of the mesure of the firmament / ffor to understand
the better the facion and how it is made and proporcioned / and of that which
is above And also we shall speak of heaven /

Thus ffynyssheth the second party of this present volume /
Here begins the third part of this present volume And declares first how
the day and the night come capitulo po
IN this third and last party of this present book we shall fynysshe it with
speaking of the faites of astronomye / And I will declare to you first / thw the
day comes and the night and for to make you understand of the Eclipses / And
also for to understand other things / the which may much prouffyte to them
that will do pain to know them / ffor to govern them the better after the
disposicion of the time /

Here declares how the day and night comen
Truth it is that the Son makes h^is torn and course about therthe in the
day and night and gooth egally every hour / And also long as he abides
above therthe / so long have we the deduyt of the day / and when he is under
therthe / then have we the night / like as ye went tornyng abrennyng candell
about your heed or as ye should bear it a lytil ferther of / Round about an
apple / And that the candel were always brennyng / then the party that were
always against the candel should alleway be l^ght / And that other party that is
ferthest fro it should be obscure and derke / Thus in like wise does the son
by his propre nature for to be / day and night about therthe / he makes the
day to grow before him / And on that other part the earth is vmbreuse and
derke by hynde him and where as he may not shine / And this is the shadow of
the night which the deduyt of the day takes away from us / but for as much
as the son is much gretter that therthe / the shadow goth lytil and lytil
till at the end it comes to naught / like the sown of a clock endures after
the stroke / But if the son and therthe were of one like gretenesse / this
shadow should have none end / but should be all egal without declynyng / And if
therthe were gretter than the son / then the shadow of ye son should goo
enlargyng and be more / as ye may see ye form by thise three fygures following
/ and also ye may preue it otherwise without fygures / Take so^me derke thing
that may retain light within it / as of tree. or of stone or other thing what
it be that may be seen through / then set that to fore your eyes / against
that thing that ye would see is it the heaven or earth or any other thing / if
that thing that ye hold is more bredder and larger than your two eyes be a
sondre / it shall take away the sight against that which is no bredder / And if
the thing be all egale in length as much as ye may stratche your two eyes /
as much shall it be taken fro you as the thing shall have of gretnes / as ye
may see by this figure bynethe an that other side / And if the thing have
less of gretnes than the length is between your both eyes / it shall take fro
you less for to see / as well nyghe as far / that it is of largenes of that
which ye would see / And when ye put the thing ferther fro your eyes / so
much the more may ye see of that other part over and above you / so that ye
may se all / In like wise is it of the son without any doubtaunce or
variacion / ffor it passes therthe in gretnesse so that it sees the heaven al
about the sterres and all that is on the firmament.

Why the sterres ben not seen by day as well as by night capitulo ijo
THe sterres of the firmament on which the son renders clernes make
contynuelly night and day their tornyng and course wyth^ the firmament round
about above as bynethe / But them that been over us we may not see by day /
ffor the son. by his great clernes and light takes from us the sight of them
/ In like wise as ye should do of candellis that were far brennyng from you /
And if there were a great fire brennyng between you and the candellis / and had
great flawme and light / it should take away fro you your sight that ye should
not see the candellis / And if the fire were take away and put byhynde you / ye
should incontinent see the candellis to fore you brennyng / Thus in like wise I
say you of the sterres that may not be seen by day / as long as the son
makes his torn and course above therthe / And when the son is under therthe
the sterres ben seen by us / But tho sterres that been over us in the somer on
the day time / in winter they be over us in ye night / and they that be under
us in the winter be over us in ye somer / ffor tho sterres that we see in the
somer by night we may not see them on the day / ffor the son that goth round
about us takes fro tho sterres their clernes that been on ye day time where
the son is unto the time that he draws him under / but all they be light
what someuer part they torn as well by day as by night / as long as the son
goth about hye and low shynyng sauf the which ben hyd by therthe fro us /
ffor as long at the shadow may comprise it / the sonn^ may give them no light
/ that ye may understand by the figure / thus the shadow discreaceth by the
son which is much gretter than therthe / and fynysheth in lassyng / And it
endures ferther fro therthe / than the moon is hye / but it faylleth above the moon /

Wherefore the son is not seen by night as it is by day capitulo iijo
THe earth is such / that she deffendeth the day which the son gives us /
if therthe were so clear that men might see thurgh^ / then might the son be
seen contynuelly as well under therthe as above / But it is so obscure and derke
/ that it takes away the sight fro us And it makes the shadow to goo all
always tornyng after the son which makes as many tornynges about therthe as
the son does / which alleway is against it / ffor when the son arises in
the morning in theest / the shadow is in the weest / and when it is right over
and above us at mydday / then is therthe shadowed under her And when the
son goth down in the west / the shadow of it is in the eest / and then
when the son is under / we have then the shadow over us / which goth
drawyng to the west / so long til the son arises and shyneth and rendrith
to us the day / And this may ye see by thise two figures to fore an that other
side /

How the moon receives dyuersly her light and clerenesse capitulo iiijo
Sith that ye have understand what it is of the day and of the night / will
ye then after see the fait of the moon / And how she receyuyth light of the
son / She receives light in such manner that she is contynuelly half full in
what someuer place she be / And when we see her round / then we call her
full / But how much the ferther she is fro the son so much the more we see
of her apparayl / and when she is right under the son / Then she apperithe
not to us / ffor then she is between there / the and the son and then she
shyneth toward the son and toward us she is all derke / And therefore we see
her not / But when she is passed the point and is remeuid fro the son /
then begins her cl^renesse to appear to us as she were horned / and so
much as she withdraws her fro the son somoche more apperith she shynyng /
and then when she apperith to be half full of light / then has she gone a
quarter of her cercle / which is the fourth part of her torn and course that
she goes every month and thus alleway her clernesse encreacyng and growyng
she goth til she be all round fair and clear in semblau^ce of a roll / and
that we call the full moan / Then is she right under the son as she may be
right against the sight in such wise that all her light is turned toward us /
Then is therthe between the son and the moon / so that we may not see them
both upon therthe / but right litil / but one of them may be seen / ffor when
that one goth down in the west / that other arises in the eest / and so at
even or morn may both be seen but not long / ffor that one goth under therthe
and that other comes above / Then the moon which has been opposite of the
son and has goon half her course then she goth on that other side
approchyng the son / and begins to less her light and mynusshe it til it
be but half again / and then has she gone three quarters of her cercle / and
is then as nygh^ the son on that side / as she was at the first quarter on
that other side / and so approaches ner and ner til she appear horned as to
fore / and thus she goth til she be al failled that we may see no more then of
her / ffor then is she under the son as ye may see by this present figure /
and I say no more hereof / but that she is then between ye son and therthe

How the eclipses of the moon happen / capitulo vo
IT happeth often times that the moon must needs lose her light / And that
happeth when she apperith most full / And she becomes as vanysshed away / and
derketh lytil and lytil / til she be all faylled / ye have herd here to fore
how the moon takes light of the son / that alleway she has half her light
hole / But when it is so that she is in eclipse / then has she no light in
no part / And this happeth never but when she is turned right so that the
son gives her full light / ffor the moon goth not always so right at does the
Son / ffor sometime she passes in her course by such away that therthe
shadoweth her all / ffor therthe is gretter than the moon is / and therefore
when therthe is just between the son and the moon / then she thus
shadoweth her / ffor between the son and the moon is a lygne which declyneth
somoche to the moon by which the son smyteth his Rays in her as long as
there is no lettyng by therthe / ffor the more that therthe is between them the
more is the moon shadowed / And the less that it is between somoche less is
the shadow / And the moon leseth the less of her light that she receives of
the son / when she is so shadowed / thus ye may understand / if a lygne
passed through therthe by the point of the myddle of it / and stratched that one
end unto the body of the son in such wise by right sight that it endured on
that other end unto the moon / which every month goth here and there / hyer
and lower / if she were so even against the son / then should she fall every
month in that shadow which on all parts should empesshe her light / which
then might not come to her for therthe in no wise / ffor the ferther she is
fro the right lygne / so much has and receives she the more of light / And
when she is so that therthe is quod opposito between them than loses the moon
her light / Thus is seen sometime the moon in the myddle of his month lose his
light and derk / when she is most full / And her light turned unto derkenesse
which we call the eclipse of the moon / as ye may well see and understand by
this figure if ye behold it well /

How the Eclypse of the Son comes. capo vjo
IT happeth sometime that the son leseth his clerenes and the light in the
plain day / ffor it goth as to declyne / and is called in latin eclipse / This
eclipse proceeds because of defaulte of light / and it happeth in this manner
that when the moon which is under the son comes right between us and the
son / then in the right lygne it behooves that toward us the moon takes
and reteygneth the light of the son on hye / so that it seems to us that is
defaylled / ffor the moon is not so pure that the son may shine over her /
and through her as through an other sterre / All like as of a candell / which
is set far fro your sight / and after ye held your hand right to fore the
candell / then ye should not see nothing thereof / And the more right ye hold
your hand between / the more less should ye see this candele / And somoche ye
may set your hand right to fore your ^yen and so far / that ye should see
nothing thereof / In this manner I tell you of the eclypse that between the
Son and the Moon is not one way comune / but the moon goth an other way
which destourneth her a lytil from the Son / wherefore us byhoueth to
understand that the moon goth oftymes when she is between us and the Son
sometime above and otherwhyle bynethe / here and there as she rises and
declyneth / But when she passyth in the right lygne even between us and the
son / then takes the moon fro us the light and clernes of the son / in
such wise as we may not clerly see her in that paas / ffor then shadoweth
she therthe / and keeps the rays of the son that they may not shine on
therthe / and they that been in this part / have in their sight ye shadow
behind them But it apperith not comunely to all men through all the world /
ffor the moon is not so great nowher nygh^ as all therthe / therefore she
shadoweth not all / but only where she is in the right lygne between therthe
and the son / And thither the philosophres were wont to goo / where as they
kn^we it / ffor by their wit and study they had learned for to approve the day
and time when such things should hap / by which they preuyd plente of
things / wherefore they preysed much our lord / Thus see we here byneth the
eclipse of the son above us / when the moon is right under the son for as
much as she is bynethe the son and above us / And then the son passes
the right lygne and goth departing and wythdrawyng so much that she apperith
as she did before / and then the moon departed is horned three days after
this Eclypse / And by this figure ye may understand plainly this that ye have
herd here tofore /

Of the eclipse that (...) at death of our lord god capitulo vijo
THus as the moon takes away fro us the light of the son / So it happeth
oftyme that therthe takes away the light of the moon as to fore is declared /
But the Eclipse of the moon may not be in no wise but when she apperith most
full / ne theclypse of the son may not be but when the moon is all waned and
faylled and that we call the coniuncion / but if god which may all thing
change and deffete at is playsir make it to come or happene otherwise / like
as it happed at such time as our savior Ihesu christ was on the cross / at
which time the light and bryghtnesse of the day faylled fro mydday unto ye ix
hour of the day / and then was the moon under therthe at the fulle as much
as she might be / which then in no wise might empesshe the light of the
son / and the day at that time was as derke and obscure as it had been propre
night / which by nature at that time should have be bright and pure / ffor
which cause saint dionyse which at this time is shryned in france / and
then being an estudyau^t in greece a paynem like a great clerk as he was /
ffor he knew much of astronomye / when he apperceyued this great obscurte and
derknes / he had right great meruaylle / and fond by astronomye that this
might not be by nature ne by reason / that the eclipse of the son should hap
and fall in such season / then said he a derke word in this manner / or
the god of nature suffers great torment by wrong / or all ye world discordeth
and shall desolue and faylle / as it that must take an end / and thought in
him self that he was a great god that so suffered and that he had power and
might above all other gods / as he that byleuid on many gods after his law
/ then this holy dionyse made an altar in his oratorye all above the other
aulters and also a part where as no person repaired but he him self only / by
cause he would not be reputed in mysbyleue / and when it was made and he had
seen it / he called it the altar of the god unknown and worshipped and
adoured him / and held him for a right dear and great god / It was not long
after this / that the holy doctor Saint poul came to this place where saint
dionys was / as he that knew him for a right great clerk / And by
commynycacion and prechyng of saint poul / he was sone converted by the help
of our lord which wrought so therein / that then he had very knowleche how
our lord had suffered his passion / ffor they were both^e good clerks as is
more plainly contained in their legendes / And thus was the noble clerk saint
dionys bycomen a good and very christian man which all his life to fore had be a
paynem / and he so employed his science and his time / fro that day forthon
that it auaylled him greatly to the health of his soul / This eclipse deceyuid
him not ne this that he knew astronomye / but he bycam after a man of so good
and holy life / that he gate for his reward the bliss of heaven / ye have herd
the fayt of eclipses if ye will understand them well / And ye shall not fare the
werse ne the less auaylle you / ffor to know it may much prouffyte to every
person / ffor such demonstrau^ces ben signefycaco^ns of great works and
things that often after happen and fall / This find well astronomyers by
Astronomye / as somtym scarcete and deffaulte of goods / or of a great derthe
or war / or death of kings or princes / that falls in the world / as they
may inquire and search by their science and reason / This Eclipse that was so
great signefyed the death of Ihesu Christ / And it ought well to come otherwise
for him / than for another / ffor he was and is by right lord and king of all
the world / and may deffete and desolue it / and ordeyne at his good playsyr /
the other eclipses comen by nature which reteyne on therthe their virtues of
things that been to come / ffor it byhoueth all to fynysshe and come to naught
/ all that is on therthe and that shortly God made not the firmament ne the
sterres for naught / which as said is goth tornyng over and above us / And
gives to the sterres names and virtues in heaven and in earth / each after his
might on all things that has growyng / ffor there is nothing but it has
sum power for as much as it has growyng / such as it ought to have by
nature and by reason / we shall now for this present leave for to speak any more
of the eclipses / And shall recompte and declare of the virtue of the firmament
and of the sterres / ffor who so well knew the virtue of them / he should know
the truth of all such thing that is bynethe here on therthe by reason of
nature / whether the thing were obscure and derke or not /

Of the virtue of heaven and of the sterres. ca. vijjo
NOw will ye here of the science by the which men get sapience for to know
and inquire the things that may happen in therthe by the work of right nature
which is figured by the world / The heuenes and the sterres ben the very
instruments of nature to the world by which she werketh all as god will as
well nygh^ as far / and who that could know her might / he had knowledge of
all thing that said is / as well of the sterres that been on heaven which have
virtues on therthe / which god has given and granted to euerich and
specially to the son and to the moon which give light unto the world / and
without whom nothing living may be / ffor by them grow all things that be in
this world / and which have end and beginning / this consents and permyseth
he that is almighty / All dyuersitees that be in persons and which have
dyuersitees of making and of corsage / and all that happeth by nature / be it
in herbs / in plants or in beestes / this happeth by the virtue celestyal
which god gaf to the sterres / when he first created the world / and that he
set them and endowed them with such nature that he ordained them to goo
round about the world against the tornyng of the firmament / And by their
tornyng and by their virtue which lies in heaven / live all things that been
under it / And if it pleasyd our lord that he would hold the heaven al stylle in
such wise that it turned not about / there is nothing in all the world /
that might meue him / In him should be no understanding no more than in a deed
body / which feleth nothing ne therein is no wit ne understanding ne moeuyng
as he that has no life / in such point shall every thing be when the heaven
shall leave his moeuyng / All thus should they be and never moeue / till that the
heaven had again his moeuyng And then should they be otherwise / but who that
then might use his wit and see what he shall be / much might he see of
semblaunces and of diverse contenaunc^s in other men that might not remeue them
/ ffor if there were no moeuyng on the heaven / there is nothing that might live
on earth / Also god will that it so be / that all thing has establisshid by
right / Thus was the will of god in whom all^ virtues habounde for to form
the world / ffor he made ne created never thing / but that he gaf to it such
virtue as it ought to have / Ellis he had made somthyng for naught and without
reason / but he did not so / ffor he never failled in no thing / he made and
created all the sterres and gaf to euerich his virtue / And who that will not
thus believe / In him is neither memoire ne reason / ffor we see openly that the moon takes light / when we see her all full / ffor the man has then neither
membre ne vain / but that it is full / when it is in the course of humors and
such things / And in like wise it happeth on all bestes / ffor they have
then their heedes and other members more garnysshid of margh^ and of humeurs
/ And the sea also flows and ebbeth in his course every month / whereof it
happeth that they that been nygh^ the sea / when they know that the moon is full
/ they wythdrawe them fro the sea on hye / And save them and their meynage /
And in this point they wythdrawe them and hold them in hye places unto the
time that the sea wythdraweth and lasseth again / And thus do they every month
But all this happeth by the moon which is one of the seven planetes / In like
wise is it seen of the son / that after the winter when he begins to
mount / he causes the fruit to be brought forth of therthe / and apparailleth
the trees with leaves / and all verdure to come again / And the birds begin
again their song for the swetenes of the new time / And when he rebasshith and
declyneth / he makes the winter to bygynne and causes flowers and leuys to
faylle and fall so long till he begin to mount again as to fore is said /
Sith that thise two sterres have such virtues / and cause such things to be
don / The other which ben pourtrayed on the heaven / were not made to serve of
naught / But to eueriche is ordained his virtue and his right after his nature
/ wherefore they make dyuersytees in things that been on therthe / And the
moeuynges of time / of which that one comes soon and that other late / And
the fruytes that come on therthe Sum come sone and erly / and the other late
/ and ben otherwhile sonner ripe in one year than in an other / and more
assured of tempests and other greuaunces / And thus change in sundry manners /
ffor one somer is soft and moist / And another is dry and wyndy / Of the
winter it happeth oftymes that they change / so that one is cold / rayny /
and more desplaysaunt that the other / And another shall be more Joyous and less
damageable / Thus is seen that the one is dear of sum vitaylle or other
things / And that other shall be plentyuous / And also it is often that there is
plente and good chepe in one year / In an other year it is had in great chierte
/ and is of great scarsete / this fallyth sometime and often / All thise
dyuersytes cause the sterres which ben on the heaven / But all this is by the
will of our lord / that has set euerich in his propre place / where he
makes naturelly his course / and euerich dyuersly / ffor if none other thing
had his use in times sauf the son only without moo / as he that goth swyftly
by the firmament every year / and mounteth as much and as hye in one somer as
in an another / and as much descends in one winter as in another every day
egally til that he come in to his right point / and Joins that other after
him where he was to fore / this know well Astronomyers that he gooth every year
about the heaven one torn / And where he is this day / in the same place he
shall be this day a year There by is it known that if none other had no power /
then should every year be lyk other / and every year always should be like as
the year to fore was / And every month should be like the same as eueriche
should come / that is to wit / one Ianyuer like another Ianyuer / and ffeuerer
like another feuerer / and in like wise all the other x months / ffor the
son goth all like in one month / as he shall the next year in the same
month / And this day should reassemble and be like unto this day a year in all
manner thing / that is to wete of hete / of cold / of fair wether / of rain
and of other things euerich after their coming all the year during / Then
should it fall by right nature that in all the summers and all the wynters that
ever have been and shall be should not come no dyuersytees / And all the times
should be like as they that by the Son should be always demened / eschauffed and
contynuelly governed / ffor he goth egally always / and ends his course every
year / and holds his right way in one estate / as he that goth not out of his
way / Thus is he the right veyle and patron of all the other sterres / ffor
it is the most fyn of all the other by the great clerenesse that is in him /
and in all things by him / and he has on therthe more power on things of
which may be inquired of nature reason and right than all the other sterres /
yet sometime they restrain his heetes / and after they enlarge them after that
they be fer or nygh^ / as he otherwhile has need / like unto a king which is
the gretter lord and the more mighty in him self for his highness than any
other of his people / nevertheless he has sometime need of them for to be helped
and served of them / ffor how much the nerrer he is to his people / so much
more is he strong and puissaunt / And the ferther he wythdraweth fro his folk
/ so much the less he exployteth of his work / In like wise I say to you of
the son which is as ye may understand / the grettest / the most mighty /
and the most virtuous / of which he has gretter power in earth / than any
other sterre may have / But the other have their power euerich in his degree /
But sith we have recounted to you the shortest wise we may of the virtue of the
firmament / we shall declare to you herafter in short how the world was mesured
as well in heyght as in depnesse / and on all sides of length and bread by
them that knew the resons of the vij scyences / Of which Geometrye is one /
by which the son / the moon / therthe / and the firmament ben mesured as well
within as without / how much it is of gretenes / and how much it is fro
therthe to the firmament / and all the gretenes of the sterres / ffor this is
preuyd by right byholdyng / And they that fond this science perceyuid that it
might not be known truly by astronomye ne the nature of the sterres without
knowing of their mesures / Therefore would they mesure them and preue al their
gretenesse /

Wherefore and how they mesured the world. ca. ixo
First of all / th^e ancient philosophres would mesure the gretnes of the
world all round about therthe tofore any other work / by which they preuyd
the heyght of the sterres / and the gretnes of the firmament all about / And
they could not find more greter mesure to be mesured / And when they had
mesured therthe how much it ha^ of largenes all about / And how much it had
of thycknes thorugh / they inquired after of the moon by cause it was lest hye
fro therthe and most nyhest thereto / And after they inquired of the son how
far it was fro therthe / And how much the body thereof had of gretnes / And
they fond it much more than all therthe was / And when they had mesured thise
three things the Son / the Moon / and therthe / They might lightly after
inquire of the other sterres / how much euerich is nygh^ or far / And the
gretenes of euerich / Of which they fond none / but his body were of more
gretenes than all therthe is / except only three of the planetes without more
/ which ben Venus. Mercurye. and the Moon / which is the third / and every
man may inquire this / if he know the science of geometrye and the science of
Astronomye with all / ffor that must he know first to fore he may find and
know the truth / But for as much as all be not good clerkis ne maistres of
astronomye that may prove this / we will recounte here after how much the earth
is long / And how thycke it is thurgh^ / And also how much the moon is above
therthe / And the son also which is above the moon / And how much each of
them has of gretenes like as the king tholomeus has preued / and also we
shall speak after that of the sterres and of the firmament / Of all this we
shall say to you / but first to fore all I shall recounte to you of the faytes
and deeds of the king tholomeus / which knew so many demonstraunces of
apparicions / and somoche loved astronomye that he would search all these
things / And we shall say to you of sum things / which ben not contrary
to you / if ye will well understand and reteyne them by which ye may learn some
good / And then after we shall mesure to you the world the best wise we may /
Now entende ye of the king tholomeus / and of the works of sum other
philosophres for your own prouffyt /

Of the king Thol^meus and of sum other philosophres capitulo xo
THolomeus was a king much subtle in Astronomye / This tholomeus was king of
egipte which held the contree long time / There were sometime many kings that
were named Tholomeus / But emonge the other this was he that knew most of
Astronomye and that most enserched of the sterres / and more understood of them
than the other / of which he composed and made plente of right fair volumes
and books / And many diverse instruments by which was found appertly all
the gretenes of therthe / and the heyght of the firmament / And how the sterres
make their course both by night and by day / By him were founden first the
oryloges of the chirches which begin the hours of the days and of the
nyghtes / The days pass fast on wherefore the chirches have great need to have
good oryloges / ffor to do thereby always the seruyse of our lord at hour
competent and due as well by day as by night / ffor god loves much for to be
adoured and served entierly and ordynatly every day / ffor the Orysons that been
said and recyted every day in the chirches playse more to our lord / than do
they that been said in many other places / And therefore the oryloges ben
necessary in every church / And men serve god the better in due time and fare
the better / and live the longer / ffor if they ruled so them self to pray at
a certain hour / And at an other hour in like wise to ete / and other things
in his right hour / it should be a light thing to do and plese god / if men
would apply them as well to such things / as they do to do that which
confounds and sleeth them / that is to wete that they be all enclyned to
conquer the richesses / of which they cesse not night ne day / And wenen to
prolonge their life thereby / But they amasse and get great tresours / and
pourchasse their death / ffor by the great goods that they assemble on all
sides / they put them in such thought and pain / that they lose often their
wit and understanding / and also their mind so that they may not enclyne and
think on thoo works that towche their salvation as they ought to do / and by
such works should they be in more ease and live longer / and plese better our
lord / And should also have more health of body and of soul / but they love
somoche the wynnyng of the goods of the world / that they leave that which
should more avail and prouffyte them / I wot never wherefore they get this
hauoir and good / ffor they lose thereby the ease of the world / by cause when
they wene to set them in ease and to be in pees / then comes death and
makes them to dye with right great sorrow / ffor the great couetyse of the
good and the pain that they have made alleway to get it without ordinance
and mesure has much the more hastelyer brought them to their death / And so
ben many men deed / that if they had ordained their affairs and business as
they ought to do at every hour competently and by order / which yet had been a
live and in good health / And lo thus ye may see how they abregge their days
and auaunce their death / ffor at long / Nature may not suffer dyuse
mayntenes unreasonable ne the sodeyn agrauacions ne griefs / of which by their
folyes they trauaylle nature / and it displesyth much unto god / And also no
good may come thereof / But gladlyer and with better will they traueylle and
more dyligently for to win and get the worldly goods / than the love of god
/ And never do they thing by order / One day goon they erly to the church /
and another day late or at such an hour / as they wene that it shall not hurt
them to auaunce their gain and wynnyng / Thus go they never to church for to
pray unto god unto the time that they wene that they shall win no more worldly
goods / But they win the less / ffor they serve god in vayn / And god shall
render to them their reward / and they shall bye right dear that they leave to
serve him / ffor he may render to them more merit in one day / than they may
get in a thousand year / Such people ben foles and evil aduysed / when of
naught they wene to serve him that all knows and all sees / ye the lest
thought that they think / yet ben there sum / when they goo to church they
goo not in entencion to pray god but only for to get the loos and goods of
the world / And pray more for their richesses / that god should keep and
multeplye them / than they do for the salvation of their sowles / which ben in
great paryll to be perisshed / And it is a great meruaylle of such manner of
people / that think well in their hertes and know well that it is evil that they
do / yet for all that / they amend them not / of which it is great pity when
they so follow the devil which is ^o feeble a thing fro whom all euyllis
sourden / Truly the devil is full of inyquyte / and without power and strength
over any person / of him self / ffor he may not vaynquysshe ne overcome / but
him that consents to his will / for who that will conduyte and rule him self
well / The inyquytees of him may not noye ne grieve / ne in no thing traueylle
him / of which he has cause to sorrow fore / as long as he will dispose him
to do well / Then may well be said. fie. / ffor they ben more than faylled
when he ouercometh them so febly and takes them in their evil deeds and
sins and ledeth them to perdico^n / where never they shall be without pain /
ne never shall have Joy / ne in nowise have hope of mercy / Of this purpos we
shall say no more now / but recounte of king Tholomeus / the which employed
his time / in the works of our lord god / Out of his books were drawn the
nombres of which the years ben ordained / And of the same is found the course
of the moon / by which is seen when she is new / Of which Julius Cezar
which of Rome was Emperor made a book called the sommes / the which is full
necessary in holy church / and it declares the golden nombre of the calendar
/ ffor by the calendar is known the course of the moon / and of all the year /
by which is also known how we ought to live after reason every day / That is
to wete in ^tyng and drynkyng / and in worshipyng our lord on hye days and
simple / and for to solempnyse such days as holy church has ordained and by
blessed saints establysshed / By the calendar we know the holy times as the
ymbre days / the lent / aduente / and the hye days and festes that we ben
most ^ounden to serve god / ffor to get his inestymable Joy and glory /
which our lord has promised unto his good and true friends which with good
heart serve him / All this lerneth us the calendar / the which was drawn out
of Astronomye / which the good king Tholomeus louyd so much / and he knew
more than any other man sauf Adam which was the first man / ffor Adam knew
all the seven scyences lyberall entyerly without fayllyng of a word / As he
that the creator ma^^ and fourmed with his propre hands / And so would our
lord have him souerayn in beauty / in wit and in strength / over al them
that should be born after him unto the coming of Ihesu Christ sone of god / the
which had given to him such virtues / Ne never after Adam gaf he so much to
one man / ne never shall / But anon as he had consented and commysed the sin
deffended / he lost somoche of his wit and power / that anon he becam a man
mortal / And he was such to fore er he had sinned / that he should never have
felt death / Ne all we descended of him should not have had less merit than
he. in Joy. in solaas ^ and in deduyt of paradys terrestre all to gydre and
born and nourysshed without sins / and after in heaven gloryfyed / But sith
they tasted of the fruit which god deffended them / his wit and his
entendement were so destroyed and corumped by his sin / that all we abide
entetched and foylled there by / ne there is nothing under the fyrmament / but it
is werse sythen than to syore and of less valewe / ye the sterres give less
light / than they did to fore / Thus all things empayred of their goodness
and virtues by the sin of adam / which god had made for man / as he that
would make him maistre of all the goods that he had made / But anon as he had
co^mysed the sin / he felt him so bare of his wit and entendement
strength and of his beauty / that him seemed he was al naked / and that he had
lost all goods as a man put in exyle / But notwythstondyng this / yet abode
with him more wit. strength and beauty / than ever any man had sythen / and
to the regard of thise three virtues that adam had / the king david that was so
virtuous and wise had ij sons which might be compared that one to the beaulte
of Adam / and that other to his wysedom / absolon might be compared to his
beaulte / and Solomon unto his wit and wysedom / And Sampson the forte^ unto
his strength / Thus were thise three virtues in Adam so parfyghtly that noman
sith might compare with him / ne the ij sons of david ne sampson / ne none
other / ffor as it is said tofore he knew the vij sciences liberal better
than all the men that been descended of him / as he to whom his god and maker
had taught them to him and enseygned / And after that / they were sought by
many a man which rendered great pain for to find them / and to save them for
cause of the flood / knowing that it should come to the world by fire or by
water /

How the scriptures and scyences were saved against the flood capitulo ^jo
Sith Adam was deed there were many men which learned the scyences of the vij
arts liberal / which god had sent to them in therthe / Of whom sum there
were that would inquire what should bycome of the world or ever it should have an
end / And they found verily / that it should be destroyed and take end twyes
/ At the first time by the flood of water / but our lord would not they should
know / whether it should be first destroyed by water or by fire / Then had
they great pity for the scyences that they had gotten which they knew / and so
should perisshe / but if it were kept and ordained fore by their wysedoms /
Then they aduysed them of a great wit and bounte / as they that well wiste /
that after the first destruxion of the world / there should be other people /
wherefore they did do make great pylers of stone / in such wise that they might
pourtraye / and grave in every stone at lest one of the vij sciences
entierly / in such wise that they might be known to other / Of which sum
say that one of thise pylers was of a stone as hard as marble / and of such
nature that water might not empayre it ne defface ne mynuysshe it / And they
made other in a strong manner of tyles all hole without any Ioyntures that
fire might not hurt it in no wise / In these great colompnes or pylers as said
is were entaylled and graven the vij scyences in such wise / that they that
should come after them / should find and learn them /

Of them that fond the science and the clergy after the flood capitulo xijo
AS ye may understand the seven scyences lyberall were founden by ancient
wise men / out of which all other sciences proceed / These were they to whom
our lord has given them and enseygned doubtyng the deluuye that god sent in
to therthe / the which drowned all creatures reseruyd Noe and them that he
took in to the Arc with him / And after this the world was repeoplyd and made
again by them that descended of them ffor after the time of noe / the people
began to make again howses and mansions / and to make ready other werkis / But
this was much rudely as they that could but right lytil unto the time that
thise sciences were fou^den again and then could they better make and do
that was nedeful and propice to them / and find remedy for their euyllis /
the first that applied him / and entermeted for to inquire and search these
sciences after the flood was Sem one of the sons of Noe / which had given his
courage thereto / And in such wise he did therein such dyligence and so
continued / that by his wit he fond a part of Astronomye / After him was
Abraham which also found a great party / And after him were other that used
their life the best wise they might so much that they had the pryncyples and
resons of the seven scyences / And after came Plato the sage and right souerayn
in philosophye / And his clerk named Aristotle the wise clerk / This plato
was the man above al them of the world in clergy the most expert of them that
were to fore or after him / he preuyd first that there was but one that was only
souerayn / which all made / and of whom all good thing comes / yet his
books approve hyely that there ne is but one souerayn good / that is our lord
god which made all things / And in this only veryte / he preuyd the right
truth / ffor he preued his power / his wisdom / and his goodness / Thise three
bountees reclayme all christian men / that is the fader / the sone / and the
holy ghost / Of the fader / he said the power and puissaunce / Of the sone /
the Sapyence / and of the holy ghost the bienueullau^ce / and Aristotle which
came after him holds plente of things nyghe to him / and knew the things
that he had said / And ordained right well the science of logyke / ffor he knew
more thereof than of other sciences / Thise two notable clerks fond by their
wysedom and connyng / three persons in one essence / and preuyd it / but they
put it not in latin / ffor both two were paynems / as they that were more than
three hundred year to fore the coming of our lord Ihesu Christ / And all their
books were in grekyssh lettres / After came Boece which was a great
philosophre and right wise clerk / the which could byhelpe him with dyuerses
langages / And louid much rightwisnes / This boece translated of their books
the most party / and set them in latin / But he deyde or he had all
translated them / whereof was great dommage for us all / Sith have other
clerks translated / But this boece translated more than any other / the which
we have yet in usage / And compiled in his life / plente of fair volumes aourned
of hye and noble philosophye / of which we have yet great need for tadresse us
toward our lord god / And many other good clerks have been in this world of
great auctoryte which have learned and studied all their time upon the
sciences of the vij Arts / Of which have been sum / that in their time have
do meruaylles by Astronomye / But above all them that most entremeted and
traueylled upon the science of Astronomye / was Virgyle which compyled many
merueyllous works / And therefore we shall recounte a lytil here following of the
meruaylles he did /

Here follow in substance of the meruaylles that Virgyle wrought by Astronomye
in his time by his wit / capitulo xiijo
VIrgyle the wise philosophre born in Itaile was to fore the coming of our lord
Ihesu Christ / he set not lytil by the vij sciences / ffor he trauaylled and
studied in them the most part of his time somoche that by astronomye he made
many great meruaylles / ffor he made in N^ples a fly of copper / which when
he had set it up in a place / that fly enchaced and hunted away all other
flies / so that there might abide none in any place ne durst none approach
nyghe to that fly by the space of two bow shote round about / And if any
fly passed the bound that virgyle had compassed / incontinent it should deye /
and might no longer live / He made also an horse of brass / the which
guarisshed and heled all horses of all their maladyes and seknesses of which
they were entechid / also sone as the seek horse looked on the horse of brass /
Also he founded a meruayllous cite upon an egg by such force and power / that
when the egg was meuyd all the cite quaued and shoke / And the more the egg
was meuyd the more the cite quaued and trembled / The cite in hye and low and
in plain / The fly of copper / and horse of brass that virgyle thus made ben
in naples And the cage where the egg is in / all ben there seen / this has
be said to us of them / that be comen fro thens and that many times have seen
them / Also he made that in one day all the fire thurgh^ out Rome faylled and
was quenchid / In such wise that no person might have none / but if he went
and fette it at the nature of a woman with a Candel or otherwise / And she was
daughter of the emperor and a great lady which to fore had don to him a great
sklaundre and dysplaysir / and all they that had fette fire at her / might not
adresse it to other / but euerych that would have fire must needs go fetch it
there as the other had fette it / And thus avenged he him on her / for the
displaysir that she had don to him / And he made a brygge upon a water the
grettest that ever was made in the world / and is not known of what matter it
is made whether it be of stone or of wode / But there was never werkman so
subtyl ne carpenter ne mason / ne other that could somoche know ne enserche
within therthe ne within the water / that they might know and find / how that
brygge was there set / ne how it was sustained in no manner / ne at ends ne
in the myddys / and men passed over freely / and all without lettyng / He made
also a gardyn all about round closyd with thayer / without any other closure
which was as thycke as a cloud / and this gardyn was right hye fro therthe /
he made also two tapres and a lamp a light and brennyng / in such wise that
it contynuelly brennyd without quenchyng / and mynusshed ne lassed no thing /
Thise three things he enclosed within therthe in such wise that noman can
find it / ffor all the craft they can do / Yet made he an heed to speak /
which answered of all that / which he was demanded of / and of that which
should happen and come in therthe / so on a day he demanded of the heed how he
should do in a certain work / where as he should goo unto / But the heed
answered to him in such wise that he understood it not well / ffor hit said
that if he kept well the heed / he should come again all hole / and with this
answer he went his way well assured / But the Son which that day gaf great
hete smote him on the head and chauffed his brayn / of which he took none head
/ that he gate thereby a sekenes and maladye whereof he deyde / ffor when he had
the answer of the heed / he understood not that he spack of his heed / but
understood of the heed that spack to him / but it had be better that he had
kept well his own heed / And when he felt him self agreuyd with sickness / he
made him to be born out of Rome / ffor to be beryed in a castle being toward
Sezyle / and a mile nyghe to the Sea / yet ben there his bones which ben
better kept than others ben / And when the bones of him ben remeuyd / the Sea
begins to encreace and swelle so greatly that it comes to the castle / And
the hyer they be raised up / the hyer grows the Sea / in such wise that the
castle should be drowned if they were not anon remysed and set in their place
/ But then when they be set again in their place anon the sea aualeth / and
gooth away there as it was to fore / And this has be oftymes proved / and yet
endure the virtues of him as they say that have been there / virgyle was a
much sage and subtyl clerk and full of great engyne / ffor unto his power he
would preue all the vsages of clerks / as much as was possible for him to
know / he was a man of lytil stature / alytil courbed was he on the back by
right nature / and went his heed hangyng down and beholding the ground /
Virgyle did and made many great meruaylles / which the herers should hold for
lesynges if they herd them recounted / ffor they would not believe that another
could do such thing / as they could not meddle wyth^ / And when they here
speak of such matters or of other that they see at their eyes / and that they
can not understand ne know not thereof / anon they say that it is by thelpe
of the fend that werketh in such manner / as they that gladly myssaye of people
of recommendacion / And also say it is good not to conne such things / but
if they knew the science and manner / they would hold it for a much noble and
right work of nature / and without any other espece of evil / And when they
know not ne understand the thing / they say much more evil than well /
Certainly who that knew well Astronomye there is nothing in the world / of
which he could inquire by reason / but he should have knowleche thereof / And
many things should he do / that should seem miracles to the people which that
knew nothing of the science / I say not but there might be well don evil by
him that could it ffor there is none so good science / but that might be
intended therein sum malice / and that he might use it in evil that would so
apply him thereto / God made never so good a gospel / but sum might torn it
contrary to truth / and there is no thing so true / but sum might so gloss
that it should be to his dampnacion / who that would pain him to do evil / how
well it is no maystrye to do ill Every man has the power to draw him self to
do well / or to do evil / which that he will / as he that has fre liberte
of that one and of that other / if he give him self to virtues / this goodness
comes to him fro our lord / and if he be inclyned to do evil / that brings
him at the end to sorrow and to pain perpetuell / Never shall the evil disposed
man say well / of that he can not well understand and know / There is no
craft. art. ne science / but it is good to be known when a man will give and
apply him self thereto / But late him do nothing against god by which he lose
his grace / All thing is known by Astronomye sauf such thing as god will
that it be not known / And so it is better to learn that / than to learn to
amasse and gadre to gydre great tresours / ffor who that could Astronomye
proprely / he should have all that he would have on earth / ffor him should faylle
nothing what someuer he would / and yet more / But they had lever have the
monoye / And they know not that it is of Astronomye ne wherefore monoye was
founden / how well that they apply all their entendement for to have it / But
they retche not for to learn / sauf that which they know shall redou^de to
their singular prouffyt / And yet for all that we shall not leave / but that we
shall recyte sum caas for them that have talente for to learn / And late him
herkne and take heed that will understand it /

Here it declares for what cause monoye was first establisshid capitulo xiiijo
THe monoyes were establisshed first / for as much as they had not of all
things necessary to gydre That one had whete / another had wyn / and another
cloth or other wares / he that had whete / had not wyn without he changed one
for another / and so must they daily change one for another / ffor to have
that they had not / as they that knew none other mean / when the philosophres
saw this / they did so much that they establisshed with the lords sometime
regnyng / a lytil light thing which every man might bear with him to bye that
was nedeful to him / and behoefful for his life / And so ordained by advise to
gydre a thing which was not over dear / ne holden for over vile / and that it
were of sum valor for to bye and use with all true marchandyse one with
another / by virtue of such enseygne / And that it were comune ouerall and in
all manner / And establed then a lytil money / which should goo and have
course through the world / And by cause it lad men by the way and mynystred to
them that was necessary / it was called monoye / That is as much to say / as
to give to a man all that him behooves for his living / Monos in grekyssh
langage is as much te say / as one thing only / ffor then was but one manner
of monoye in all the world / But now every man makes monoye at his playsir by
which they desuoy and goo out of the way more / than if there were but one
coin only / ffor by this cause is seen often plente of diverse monoyes / Thus
establisshed not the philosophres / ffor they establisshed for to save the
state of the world / And I say it for as much if the monoye were out of
grotes and pens of silver so then it should be of less weight and less of
valewe / and that should be better for to bear by the way for pour folk / and
better should be easid for the help of their needs to their living And for none
other cause it was ordained first / ffor the monoyes be not preysed but for the
gold and silver that is therein / And they that establisshed it first / made it
right lytil and light / ffor the more ease to be born al about / where men
would goo / ffor now in late days as in the beginning of the Regne of king
Edward and long^ after was no monoye curraunt in england but pens and halfpens
and ferthynges / And he ordained first the grote and half great of silver / And
noble / half noble and ferthyng in gold /

Here follows of phylosophres that went through the world capitulo xvo
THus the philosophres by the moyen of their monoye went where they would
through the world / And the marchantes / in their marchandyses / or in
pylgremages / or in pourchacyng and enquyryng sum places that they would
know of whom there were many which were philosophres / and that would have
experience of all things and they went by see and by land for tens^rche the
very truth of the secret things of heaven and of earth / They rested them
not by the great fyres ne brassed not as some do now in these days in the
world / the which give them to do no good ne apply to no virtues / but if
it be to have the loos and preysyng of the world / But they went serchyng by
the sea and the land on all parties for to know the better the good and the
yuell / and for to conne discern that one fro that other / by which they
endured many great trauaylles for to get the saving of their sowles / And at
this day all men seche to get Richesses and tresour / and the name to be
called maistre for to get loving and honor of the world / which so hastily
faylleth / Certainly an evil man may not think on hye things / ffor who that
is of earth / to therthe entendeth / And who pretends to god / God attends
to him / ffor god him self says / who that is of therthe / speaks of therthe
/ And who that comes fro heaven / unto heaven per / tended / he without other is
lord and sire of and above other / The philosophres that well could understand
this word / had much lever to suffer trauaylles and mesayses for to learn /
than tendende to worldly honors / ffor they held for more dear and worthy the
sciences and the clergyes / than all the seygnouryes of the world / Plato
which was a puissaunt and a recommended maistre of Athenes left his noble
estate and his place / by cause he would of such renommee live / that he
serched many lands and contrees / And had lever have pain. mesayse and
trauayll for tenserche truth / and for to learn science / than for to have
seygnourie and domynaco^n in the world ne renommee for to be master / ffor he
would say nothing but if he were certain thereof / ffor any vain glory of the
world / Apolynes which was so great a prince left his empire / and his
Royamme / And departed al pour and naked for to learn the scyences / And he
was taken and sold oftymes to strange men / Ne never was there none of them so
valyant of all them that bought and sold / that he set ought thereby / so
that he might alleway learn / And more trauaylled on all parties for to learn
and know god and the world / which he loved better than any other worldly
thing / and he went so far / that he fond syttyng in a Trone of gold an
hye philosophre and of great reno^mee / the which ^nseygned and taught his
discyples within his trone where he satte / and learned them of the faytes of
nature / of good manners / the course of the days and of the sterres / and the
resonne and signefiaunce of things touching sapyence and wysedom / This
philosophre was named hyarchas / After Appolyn^s serched by many contrees so
far that he fond the table of fyn gold / which was of so great renommee /
that it was named the table of the Son / wherein all the world was pourtrayed
/ Therein saw he and learned many faytes and many meruaylles / which he louyd
more than any Royamme / he erred so far by strange lands that he passed the
flood of Ganges and all ynde / and in the end so far / that he might find
no more way / And where someuer he came / he fond and learned alleway such as
might auaylle and prouffyte to him self and other for tauau^ce him tofore god /
Thus the king Alysaundre also suffered trauaylles without nombre for to learn /
But he went fro place to place in estate ryall / And with puissaunce of people
/ wherefore he might not so well learn ne inquire the truth of things / virgyle
also went through many contrees for to inquire and search the truth of all
things / Tholomeus which of Egypt was king was not all quyte of his part /
but went by many con^trees and Royammes for to learn experymente / and see all
the good clerks that he might find / Saint Brandon never left for to labor
by see and by land / ffor only to see and learn / And he saw plente of great
meruaylles ffor he came in to an isle of the sea / where he saw certain birds
which spack as spyrites / which said to him some thing which he demanded of
them the understanding / And so far he erred that he fond one so perylous a
place and so full of spyrites in so terryble tormentis / that they could not be
nombred ne esteemed / Emonge whom he saw one that answered to him and said that
he was Judas that betrayed Ihesu Christ / which every day was tormented an
hundred times / and deye he might not / and plente of other great meruaylles he
saw / as alonge is recou^ted in the legende of his life / There were many other
philosophres that serched the world as much as was possible for them to do
for to know the better the good and the evil and spared for nothing / ffor
they believed not lightly a thing till they knew it well by experyence / Ne all
that they fond in their books / to fore they had preuid it for to know god
the better and to love him / But they serched by see and by land / till they
had enserched all / and then after returned again to their studyes alleway
for to learn the virtues and good manners / And thus loved somoche philosophye /
ffor to know them self the better in good and just life / but by cause that
many times we have spoken of philosophye / and that somoche good comes thereof
that a man may have thereby understanding to know and love god / therefore we
shall tell to you what it signefyeth /

What thing is philosophye / and of thanswer that Plato made thereof capitulo
xvjo
Very Philosophye is to have knowleche of god / and fyn love of sapyence / and
to know the secrets and ordinances of dyuyne things / and of humayne / ffor
to know god and his power / and what a man ought to be / so that he might
conduyte him that it might be to god agr^able / who that well knew god and his
mysteryes / he should well conne entierly philosophye / All they ben good
philosophres that of them self have knowleche / Of whom Plato answered to sum
that demanded him in commun / and said to him that he had learned ynowh and
neded no more / ffor he had estudyed all his time for to learn / And it was
said to him / Maystre it is well in you for to say to us / sum good word
procedyng of hye entendement / as ye have don other times / Then plato how
well that he was the most experyme^ted of all other answered saying as in his
heart troubled / that he had no more learned sauf as much as he that felt him
self like unto a vessel that day and night is all void and empty / Thus much
answered Plato and no more / how well he was at that time the most great clerk
that was known in all the world / and of much perfounde science They that on
thise days will meddle / take non head to answer thus / but make semblau^t to
be meche great clerkis and expert / for to get the loos and preysyng of the
world / which ledeth them to dampnacion / and brings their folly in to their
hedes so that they entende no more to virtues than do beestis / ffor they be
not all clerks that have short typettis / ffor there be many that have the
Array of a clerk / that can not well understand / that he redeth / ne yet sum
that be prestis can not well and truly read neither / And when such know any
thing / that them seem be of valewr / Then wene they to know all / But
much remains of their folyssh consayte / They ^e of the nature of proud
foles that been surquydrous / that seche nothing but loos and preysyng of the
people / and traueylle them self for to deceive the world / this shall they abye
dear ones / It were better for them to learn such science / that should make
them to understand truth and right / like as these ancient wise men did /
the which so lytil preysed the world / that all their time they ocupyed in
lernyng of phylosophye / Thus estudyed auncyently the phylosophres to fore
their death for tadresse them and other to their maker and creator / And in
deed traueyllyd much for tadresse all people to virtue / They ordained the
monoyes that they bare for to have their lyuelode in byeng and payeng / ffor
men give not allewaye / And for couetyse of the people that have fere of their
despences / it corumpeth right and nature / ffor by reason and right euerych
ought to take his living / And therefore was monoye establysshid f^r to sustain
to euerich his living when they went by the way But they love their kar^ynes
and bodies much more than need is / And reteyne and keep more goods and
richesses that they need for their ordynarye / which they let rote and faylle
by them / and see that many pour persons have great need thereof / The monoyes
were not found for this cause / but for to have their living / unto the tym^
that death comes and takes all that he ought to take at the playsyr of god /
And thus should they be more ^asyd / than they now be and euerych should have
that him lacked and they should leave to do so many sins / But they be not so
wise / as were they / that by their wit fond again Astronomye / of whom
Tholomeus was one / And trauaylled so much that he knew and proved the course
of the sterres that been on the heaven / and mesured them all on hye / whereof we
have spoken here to fore / And now we shall recounte from hensforth the gretenes
of therthe and of heuene / of the Moon / of the Son / of the Sterres / and of
the planetes / which things be not comune unto all men / like as the king
Tholomeus him self mesured them unto the abysme / And preuyd by reason in a book
that he compyled named Almageste / which is as much to say as an hye work /
Then will ye here what he says herto / which many another has also proved
after him by his book / In which he gaf the craft and science to prove and
see it by reason /

How much therthe is of heyght round about and of thyckenes by the myddle
capitulo xvijo
THe Ancient philosophres mesured the world on all parties / by their
science. Art. and wit unto the sterres all on hye / of which they would
know the mesure / ffor to know the better their nature / But first they would
mesure therthe and preue his gretenes / And then when they had mesured
therthe al a boute by a craft that they knew and proved by right reason / they
mesured it round about like as they should have compassed it al about with a
gyrdle / And then they stratched out the gyrdle al alonge / And then that
which went out of length of the gyrdle / they fond it in length.xx.M.cccc.
and.xxvij. miles / Of which every mile conteyneth a thousand paas / and every
paas five foot / and every foot xiiij inches / Somoche has the earth in
length round a boute / by this fond they after how thycke therthe is in the
myddle / And they fond the thycknes thereof like as it should ben c^efte in the
myddle fro the highest to the lowest / or fro that one side to that other.vj.M.
and.v.C. miles By this last mesure / which is after nature right / they
mesured justly the heyght of the firmament / ffor they could nowher find a
gretter mesure / ffor textende the gretenesse of all things which ben
enclosed within the heuene /

How the Moon and the Son have each of them their propre heyght capitulo
xviijo
THerthe as the au^cyent philosophres say / after they had mesured it / they
mesured ye sterres / the planetes and the firmament / And first they mesured
the moon / and preuyd his gretnesse / And they fond the body of therthe
without and withinne / that after their comune mesure it was more great / than
the body of the moon was / by xxix times and a lytil more / And they fond that
it was in heyght above the earth xxiijj times and an half as much as therthe
has of thycknes / Also in like wise pr^uyd they touching the son by very
demonstraunce and by reason / that the Son is gretter than all therthe is /
by an hundred syxty and six sythes / But they that know nothing hereof /
uneath and with great pain will believe it / And yet it is suffysauntly preuyd
/ as well by maystryse of science / as by verray connyng of Geometrye / Of
which have been many sith the phylosophres that fond this first / that have
studied and trauaylled for to know the truth / if it were so as is said /
or not / somoche that by quyck reason they have preuyd that thauncyent
phylosophres had said truth as well of the quantyte of the Son as of the
heyght / And as to the regard of him that compyled this work / he set all
his entente and time / by cause he had so great meruaylle thereof / till he had
perceived plainly that / of which he was in doubt / ffor he saw appertly
that the Son was gretter than al therthe without any defaulte by an.C.lxvj.
times / and three parties of the xx part of therthe / with all this that
thauncyent philosophres said / And then byleuid he that / which was give
him to understood And he had never put this in writing / if he had not
certainly known the truth / and that he plainly had proved it / And it may
well be known that it is of great quantyte / when it is so much far fro us /
and seems to us so lytil / Ne he shall never be so far above us / but in
like wise he shall be as far when he is under or on that other side of us /
And for truth it is fro therthe unto the Son / like as the king Tholomeus
has prouyd it / ffyue hundred lxxx and v times as much as therthe may have of
gretenes and thyckens thurgh^ /

Here follows of the heyght of the sterres and of their gretenesse capitulo
xixo
NOw will I recounte to you briefly / of the sterres of the firmament / Of
which there is a right great nombre / and they ben all of one like heyghte /
But they ben not all of one gretenes / And it behooves over long narracion
that of all them would deseryue the gretenes / And therefore we pass lightly
over and shortly / how well I aduertyse you and certefye / that there is none so
lytil of them that ye may see on the firmament / but that it is gretter than
all therthe is / But there is none of them so great ne so shynyng as is the
Son / ffor he enlumyneth all the other by his beaulte / which is so much
noble / ffro therthe unto the heaven wherein the sterres ben set is a much
great espace / ffor it is ten thousand and lv^ sythes as much and more as is
all therthe of thycknes And who that could acompte after the nombre and form
/ he might know how many inches it is of the hand of a man / and how many
fe^t / how many miles / and how many Iourneyes / it is from hens to the
firmament or heaven / ffor it is as much way unto the heaven / as if a may might
goo the right way without lettyng / and that he might goo every day xxv miles /
of france / which is.l. englissh mile / And that he tarried not on the way /
yet should he goo the time of seven.M.j.C. and.lvij. year and an half / er he
had goon somoche way as fro hens unto the heaven where the sterres be inn / if
the first man that god fourmed ever / which was Adam / had goon fro the first
day that he was made and created xxv miles every day / yet should he not have
comen theder / but should have yet the space of.vij.C.xiij. year to goo / at the
time when this volume was performed by the very auctour / And this was at
Epyphanye in the year of grace.j.M.ij.C and.xlvj. That time should he have had
so much to goo / er he should comen theder / Or if there were there a great
stone which should fall fro thens unto therthe / it should be an hundred year
er it came to the ground / And in the falling it should descend in every hour
of which there be xxiiij in a day complete / xliij mile and an half / yet should
it be so long er it came to therthe / This thing has be proved by him that
compiled this present volume / er he came thus far in this work / This is
well.xl. times more than an horse may goo / which alleway should goo / without
resting /

Here follows of the nombre of Sterres capitulo xxo
TO the regard of the Sterres we shall say to you the nombre like as the noble
king Tholomeu^ nombred them in his Almageste / to whom he gaf the propre
names / And said that there were a thousand and xxij all clear / and that might
be all seen / without the vij planetes / and may be well acompted without any
paryll / In all there be.j.M. and.xxix. which may well be seen without many
other / which may not well be seen ne espied / There may not well moo be espied
but so many as said is / ne appertly be known / Now late him behold that will
see it / ffor noman / trauaylle he never somoche ne study / may find no more
/ Nevertheless there is no man living that may or can compte so much / or can so
hye mou^te in any place / though he be garnysshid of a much gentil instrument
/ and right subtyl that should find moo / than the king tholomeus fond by
which he knew and might no^bre them / and where eueryche sits / and how
far it is from one to an other / be it of one or other or nygh^ or far /
and the knowledge of the images of them / the which by their semblaunce fourmed
them / ffor the sterres which be named / ben all fygures on the heuene and
compassed by images / and that all have diverse beynges / And euerych has his
form and his name / Of which ben known pryncypally xlvij within the
firmament / And of them ben taken xij of the most worthy which ben called the
xij Signs / And they make a cercle round about the vij planettes / where as
they make their torn / we ben much far from heaven merueyllously / and late
every man know that he that deyeth in dedly sin / shall never come theder /
And the blessed soul which is departed fro the body in good estate / not
withstondyng the long way is sone come thither / ye truly in less than half
an hour / and unto the most hye place to fore the souerayn judge / which sits
on the right side of god the fader / in his blessed heaven / the which is so
full of delytes of all glory and of all consolacion / that there is noman in
this world living / that may ne can esteem ^e think the Joy and the glory
where this blessed soul enters / And there is no man that can esteem ne think
the capacite and gretnes of heuene / ne may compare it ne valewe it / to the
capacyte and gretnes of all therthe / or so much as may compryse fro therthe
to the firmament / As to the regard of the inestymable gretenes above the
firmament / ffor that gretenesse is inestymable without end and without mesure
/ Certes the firmame^te on hye is so spacyous so noble and so large / that of
all his wit may not a man uneath think or esteem / the nombre of like
masses as all therthe is / that should fylle it / if they were all in one mass
/ who is he that could or might co^prehende or compryse the gretenes of them /
when they all be assembled / And euerich as great as all therthe / Nevertheless
we shall say to you thereof / as much as we may well ymagyne /

Of the gretenesse of the firmament / and of the heaven which is above it
capitulo xxjo
IF the earth were so great and so spacyouse / and so much more for to
resseyue an hundred thousand times as much people as ever were in this world /
and every man of them were so mighty for to engend^e another man every day
during an hundred thousand year / and that every man were as great as a Geaunt
/ and every man had his hows as great / as ever had any king / and woods /
Ryuers / champaynes gardyns medows pastures and vyneyerdes euerych about his
castle or place for to live with / And that each had so great foyson / that
eueriche might hold an hundred maynyes for to serve him and euerich of this
maynee held xx other / and had thereto great romme and pourpris in their manoyr
/ All these might much plentyuously be reseyuyd within the firmament / and
yet should there be much place void more than all they might pourprise and
take for to play and dysporte them therein if they would / Then ought we well
to know / that our lord god is much mighty. and of a right hye affayre / when
he can make of naught so noble a thing / as the heuene / and the Son / and
all the other things that been on the heuene / in thayer / on the earth and in
the Sea Such a lord and such a maistre ought well to be god that can make so
noble things / of which we have very knowleche / And we ought parfyghtly to
love him / And well may every man think / that the thing that is above is
much gentyl and much noble / when it that is under is so subtyl / ffor that
which is above is more great an hundred thousand times than it which is
bynethe / And over much more than can be known or may be compted by any
nombre / or may be thought / ffor this is a thing that in no manner shall have
end ne term / Therefore I may well understand / that there is nothing that may
pourprise ne esteem in gretenes ne otherwise this / which is above the
firmament / where the heuene takes his place / ne may be replenesshid ne
filled with nothing that may be / but if it be with the goods of our lord god
fyllyd / but the right debonayre lord is so much full of all goods that be
fylleth all other things / which ought to have part and merit in goods /
And the evil departs fro the good in such wise that it is void and
disgarnysshed from all goods what someuer it be / and that it shall be / like
as it were naught / whereof is read hereof / that sin is naught / ffor as
much as it is void and disgarnysshed of all goodness / And rendered the body
and soul so much febled and disgarnysshid of all goods / of all virtues /
and of all graces / that that one is totally destroyed and perisshed with that
other / ffor alleway the evil comes to naught / And contrary the good goth
always growyng and in amendyng / And therefore there is none evil but sin /
which is naught / ffor ye may understand that it comes to naught as donge /
There is nothing / that ought to be made right / but only this that ought to be
permanent / And therefore it is good a man to hold him nyghe the good / ffor the
good amendeth always / And who that customly does gladly the good works /
they ben the cause to lead him to heuene / as he that has none other
wythdraughte ne other dwelling place / And therefore he must enhabite there /
him behooves to come in to heuene for to reteyne there his place / and also for
to fylle it / There is noman in the world that can do so much good but that
he shall always find his place and his repair propice after his merytes / ffor
as much as this so much noble a place is without end and without term / in
such wise / that no goods what someuer they be shall neu have term ne end /
ne never shall have defaulte / but it is contynuelly full of all consolacion /
of all delyces / of all goods / of all Joy / and of all gladness /
without having any thing void / Of which they that deserve it of our lord
shall have full possession of all the inestymable goods / Of hell I may freely
say to you / that there is nothing sauf sorrow and martirdom / truly the most
anguysshous the most horrible / and somoche sorrowful / that there is no like /
And if so were that the children that have been sith Adam were all dampened / yet
it might not be filled by them / though they were twyes so many more / And they
that be therein perisshed / shall be dampened and perpetuelly tormented / ffor
after that they be dampened / they shall abide ever as long as god shall be /
which is without beginning and without endyng / And there they shall brenne in
fire eternel without hope of alegeau^ce / of any mercy of any hope to have any
better / but alleway werse fro time to time / As it is so that the saved sowles
desire the day of dome and of judgment for to be gloryfyed in body and soul /
The dampened sowles redoubte and dread it thinking that after that day they
shall be perpetuelly tormented in body and in soul / And to that dredeful day
they be not tormented in the body / but in the soul / And I have recyted this
thing shortly to this end that it may be known certainly that there is no
good deed but it shall be rewarded / ne none evil deed but that it shall be
punysshed / This is the will of the creator and maker of all things without
whom there is none that in any manner has any power / and he is somoche a
debonayer lord full of souerayn puissaunce and of great and of infynyt goods /
that there is no comparison to him / As he that all thing created. made. and
establisshid of naught at his playsir and will But sith we have spoken to you
of the inestymable gretenesse of the firmament wherein the sterres be set
which alleway is in moeuyng / So shall ye understand that there is an heaven
above / where they that been there moeue nothing / but ben contynuelly in one
estate / like as sum man remeuyd him from some place to another / the first
place meuyd him not / But he that should goo so al about like round about a
cercle / should often go fro place to place er he come to his place / and so
long he might goo that he should come right to the place fro whens he departed
first But that place should not meue / but hold him alleway in one point / Now
will ye thus understand of this heaven / that there is no manner place that is
remeuyd fro the sterres ne fro the firmament / but they hold them also fermly
all / as they most may / This heaven must be understand by them which ben
Astronomyers / This is that gyu^th to us his color blew / the which estendeth
above thayer / the which we see when thayer is pure and clear all about /
And it is of so great attemperau^ce / that it may have no violence / This is
the heaven that encloseth the firmament / Now I shall say you all appertly /
that this that ye may understand here tofore / by heeryng / may not be taken
ne known / ne be proved if it be truth or non / ne may not be by any art of
demonstraunce / like as may be seen by eyes / ffor the wit of a man has not
the power / But nevertheless we shall say to you this / that we truly may find
by writing in certain places / like as sum Ancient philosophres have
ymagyned and thought / of which they fond certain resons /

Here after follows of the heaven crystalyn and of the heuene imperyall
capitulo xxijo
Above this heaven that we may see blew as said is / after that thauncyent
clerks say / there is another heuene all round about that above and bynethe
/ like as it were of the color of white crystal. clear. pure. and much noble
/ And is called the heaven crystalyn / And above this heaven crystalyn / all
round about that / is an other heaven of the color of purple / like as the
deuynes say / And that is called the heaven Imperyal / This heuene is
garnysshid and full of all beaultees / more than any of the other that we have
named / and there is thayer seven times more fair and more clear than is the
son / ffro this heaven Imperyal fylle the evil angeles by their pride / the
which were disgarnysshid of all glory and of all goods / And there ben the
blessed Angeles of our lord /

Here follows of the Celestyal heuene capitulo xxiijo
Yff ye will understand for to know of this heuene Celestyall / which is
above all the other / ye shall (...) understand that this place is right
worthy and blessed in all things / wherefore there may nothing grow / but all
goodnesses / and swetnesse by reason and right / This is the propre place of the
holy trynyte / where as god the fader sytteth in his right worthy mageste / But
in that place faylleth thentendeme^t of any erthely man / ffor there is nowher
so good a clerk that may think the tenth part of the glory that is there /
And if our lord pourpryseth any place / him behooves to have that by right /
but he is so comune ouerall / that he sees every man / that has deseruyd it
against him / and sees all things here and there / He sees all about as he
that has all things in his keeping / Of which ye may take ensample / by s^mme
when ye here them speak / that all they of whom they here the tale / they here
his word / Many men understand al attones / and in one time here / Every man
hereth all the word / In like wise may ye understand that god is ouerall and
regnyng ouerall in every place / and is in all places anon and attones / And
the light and clerenes that grows of him enlumyneth all things both here
and there / and also soon that one as that other / Example / if ye set
about many things a light / also soon shall the resplendour goo on the side
by yonde it / as on the side on this side it / when such things have like
virtue / Over much more ought he to have / that all thing made and created /
And that all goods has within him / his heaven stratched oueral / as he
which of all is lord and maistre / In heaven ben all thangeles / all
tharchangeles and all the saints which sing all to gydre tofor god glory
and lawde with right great Joy and consolacion There is none that may compryse
/ ne heart of man mortal may understand what thing is heuene / And how much
great Joy they have / to whom he has given and granted it / The best clerk
of the world / the most subtyl / and the best spekyng with all / that ever was
living in earth / or ever shall be in any time of the world / and thaugh he had
a thousand tongues speaking / And euerych of the tongues spack by him self /
and also had a thousand hertes within his body the most subtyle and the most
memoratyf that might be taken and founden in all the world and best chosen to
understand and to experymente / and if this might be and hap that all this
might be to gydre in the body of a man / And after might think always / the
best wise that they could deseryue and deuyse thestate of heaven / And that
every tongue might say and declare the intencion of every heart / yet might
they never in no manner of the world say ne recounte the thousand part of the
great Joy / that the pour^st and leest of them that shall be there shall have /
And foul be he / that shall not be there / ffor they that shall be in heuene would
not be all the days of world / lords and kings of all the Monarchye of the
world erthly thaugh all their commandments might be observed and don / not
for to ben one only hour out of heaven / ffor there is the life perdurable / and
there is the parfyght and inestymable Joy that ever was and ever shall be /
There is every thing establisshed and certain for ever more without end and
without beginning ne never shall faylle / ne there shall never be any doubtau^ce
of death ne of maladye / of sorrow / of anguyssh^. ne of deed / of anger of
trauayll of pain ne of pouerte / of caytyfnes ne of any trybulacion / that
ever may hap in any manner of the world to him that shall have his mansyon in
heuene / But he shall be contynuelly in Joy / in solace / in all delices / and
in all goods perdurable and without end / And he shall have more consolacion
than any man can think ne esteem / thaugh he employe all his engien for to
understand it / Now for to know what it is of heuene and of hell after our
declaracion to fore said / and with this the firmamente / the sterres and the
seven planetes / I present them to you here on that other side of this leef by
a figure / by which ye may much prouffyte / if ye will well apply and
employe thereto your entendemente /



Her follows the recapitulacion of the thing tofore said capitulo xxiiijo
With this we shall make an end of our book / The which at his beginning
speaks of our lord god wherefore he fourmed the world / And why he loved man so
well that he fourmed him to his semblaunce / and gaf him power to do well and
evil / After why he made him not such / that he might not sin dedely / And
how first were founden the vij sciences and the arts / Since it speaks of three
manner of people that thauncyent philosophres put in the world / how nature
werketh / and what she is / and how she dyuersefyeth in euerych of her works /
Also ye have herd of the facion of the world and of the dyuysion of the four
elements / which ben round about / and hold them on the firmament / And how
the earth holds him within the firmament / Also ye have herd of the lytilnes
of therthe unto the regard of heaven / And also how the son makes his ^ours
al about therthe / and the other planettes in like wise / all this have ye
herd in the first party / In the second party is declared to you / which
part of therthe is inhabyted / and of the dyuysion of mappa mundi / And first
it speaks of paradys terrestre / and of the contrees and regyons of ynde / and
of the dyuersytees that been there of men / of bestes / of trees / of stones / of
birds / and of sum fysshes that been there / And where hell the dolourous
place is and stondeth / and of the great pains that they endure that been
dampened and ben there / After ye have herd of the second element / that is of
the water / of the flodes and of the fontaynes hoot and cold / holsom and
evil which ben in diverse contrees / and how the sea bicom^th salt how the
earth quaueth and synketh / And after of the Air how hit blows and rayneth /
of tempests and of thondres / of ffyre of layte / and of the sterres which
seem as they fylle / Of pure air and of the vij planettes / how the bysexte
comes / of the firmament and of his tornyng / and of the sterres that been
round about therein / In the third party ye have herd how the day and night
come / And of the moon and of the son how they render their light / and how
each of them leseth their clerenes by night and by day sometime / and of the
Eclipses that then hap / whereby the day bycometh derke / And of the great
eclypse that fylle at the death of our lord Ihesu christ / by which saint
dionys was after ward converted / and of the virtue of the firmament and of the
sterres / and how the world was mesured / and the heaven and therthe Of the
king Tholomeus and of his prudence / of Adam and of sum other / And how
clergy and the vij sciences were kept against the flood / and how all this was
fou^den again after the flood / and of the merueylles that virgyle made by his
wit and clergy / and for what cause money was so named and establisshed /
and of the philosophres that went through the world for to learn / what thing
is philosophye and what plato answerde thereto / how much y^ earth / the moon
and the son have of gretenes euerych of him self / and thestages of the
sterres / of their nombre / and of their images / the heyght and gretenes of
the firmament / and of the blew heaven which is above that / and of the heuene
crystalyn / and of the heaven Imperial / And as ye have herd in the end of the
heuene celestyal / and of his estate / and of god which may be oueral by his
glory and his bonute / of all thise things ye have herd us recounte and
tell / and rendrid to you many fair resons briefly / ffor the princes and
other people ben nothing curyous to here long gloses without great entendeme^t
/ but love better short things / as they that been not of long time / but
pass briefly / ffor in a short time they be fynysshed / and end / And all
we shall come more shortly than we would to naught / ffor this world passes fro
time to time like as the wind / and faylleth fro day to day / and makith to
euerych a lytil seiournyng / ffor it is so full of vanyte / that there nys but
lytil truth therein / and it happeth oftymes that he that weneth lengest to
seiourne here / is he that leest while abides and that sonnest takes his end
/ and therefore I counseylle every man / that each pain and trauaylle him self
to live well and truly for the litil time that he has for to abide in this
world full of tribulacions and myseryes / ffor there is none that knows what
hour or time ye death shall come run on him / and it often happeth that he or
she that weneth yet to live and play in this world / vj or viij or x year /
that he deyeth in less than five days / and fyndeth him self dampened and cast
down in to the brennyng fornays of hell / and then is he in a good hour born
and well aduysed / when at his end he is taken in the seruyse of our lord / and
nothing in the worldly voluptuositees and dampnable / and that his maker has
lent to him to understood him and that he have time and space / ffor god shall
render to him so rich a yefte and so fair / that he shall have all goods at
his abandon with the Joy perdurable of heuene / The which to us be granted
by the creator and rede^ptour of the world in whom all pity and mercy
haboundeth / and in whom be all goods and virtues what someuer have been. ben^
and shall ben perdurably without end /

Thus fynysshith the book called thymage or myrrour of the world / the which
in speaking of god and of his works inestymable has bygonne to enter in matter
speaking of him and of his hye puissances and domynacions / and takes here an
end / ffor in all begynnynges and in all operacions the name of god ought to
be called / As on him / without whom all things ben naught / Then he so
ottroye and grant to us so to bygynne / persevere / and fynysshe tha^ we may
be brought and receyuyd in to his blessed glory in heuene unto the blessed
Trynyte. ffader. Sone. and holy ghost / which lives and regneth without end
in secula seculorum / Amen /

ANd where it is so / that I have presumed and emprised this foresaid
translacion in to our englissh^ and maternal tongue / In which I am not well
parfyght / And yet less in frensshe / yet I have endeuourd me therein / at
request and desire. cost and dispense of the honorable and worshipful man.
Hughe Bryce Cytezeyn and Alderman of london / which has said to me that he
entendeth to present it / unto the puissaunt noble and virtuous lord / My
lord hastynges. Chamberlayn unto our souerayn lord the king / And his
lieutenaunt of the town of Calays and Marches there / In which translacion I
knowleche my self simple. rude. and ygnorau^t / wherefore I humbly byseche my
said lord Chamberlayn to perdenne me of this rude and simple translacion / how
be it / I leye for mine excuse / that I have to my power followed my copye And as
nygh^ as to me is possible I have made it so plain / that every man reasonable
may understand it / if he aduysedly and ententyfly read or here it / And if
there be fault in mesuryng of the firmament / Son / Moan / or of therthe / or
in any other meruaylles herin contained / I beseech you not tarette the
defaulte in me / but in him that made my copye / which book I began first to
translate the second day of Ianyuer the year of our lord.M.CCCC..lxxx. And
fynysshyd the viij day of March the same year / And the xxj year of the Regne
of the most Christian king / king Edward the fourth / under the Shadow of
whose noble proteccion I have emprysed and fynysshed this said lytil work and
book / Besechynge Almighty god to be his protector and defendour again all
his Enemies / and give him grace to subdue them / and inespeciall them that
have late enterprysed again right and reason to make war within his Royamme /
And also to preserve and mayntene him in long life and prosperous health / And
after this short and transitorye life he bring him and us in to his celestyal
bliss in heuene Amen /
