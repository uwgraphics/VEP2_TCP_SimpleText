His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
YOU have shown so great Concern for My Person, and Zeal for My Government, and
have done so much for the Preservation of the One, and for the Strengthening of
the Other, by the Good Laws which have been made, and by the Supplies you have
Provided for the several Occasions of this Year, that the late Designs of Our
Enemies are (by the Blessing of God) like to have no other Effect, than to let
them see how firmly We are United, and to give Me this Occasion to Acknowledge
your Kindness, and to Assure you of all the Returns which a Prince can make to
His People.

My Lords and Gentlemen,

The Necessity of Affairs requiring My Absence out of the Kingdom for some
time, I do earnestly Recommend to you, That in your several Stations you will
be Assisting to those whom I shall leave to Administer the Government, and that
you will be careful in Preserving the Public Peace of the Kingdom.

Then the Lord Keeper, by His Majesty's Command, said,
My Lords and Gentlemen,
IT is His Majesty's Royal Will and Pleasure, That this Parliament should be
Prorogued to Tuesday the Sixteenth day of June next; and this Parliament is
accordingly Prorogued to Tuesday the Sixteenth day of June next.

FINIS.
