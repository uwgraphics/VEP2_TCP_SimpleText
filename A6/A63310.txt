A TRUE ACCOUNT OF A Great Engagement Between The Germans and the French. On
the Fourteenth of March, 1689.
FRom Elsen near Nuis upon the Rhine, it is Related, That the French who kept
Garrison in Nuis, having given Orders for the Boors to be Ready with their
Wagons and Carts on the twelth of March, to carry two thousand Measures of Rye
to Keyserswert under a Convoy of Horse and Foot, gave Occasion to some
Brandenburg Troops (who had notice thereof) to place themselves in Ambuscade
between Ordingen and Lein, where they continued undiscovered till the French
fell in among 'em, whom they immediately Charged with a Bravery the French
Convoy could not resist; their Horse being routed, five Companies of Foot threw
down their Arms, and were made Prisoners of War. The loss sustained by the
French, in Money and other Things of value, is very considerable; Major Lion,
who Commanded this Convoy, loosing five thousand Crowns in Specie for his part.

An Account of this Defeat being brought to the Marquess de Sourdis, and the
Sieur de Bartillac, General Officers of the French Troops in this Diocese, they
presently gathered all the Force they could, in hopes to overpower the
Brandenburgers, (who were Commanded by General Barfus) and recover the Booty;
But the Brandenburgers, who were reinforced by another Detachment that was
advanced to sustain those in Ambuscade, Behaved themselves so well, that very
few of the French escaped, they being surrounded on all sides, and Charged by
the Brandenburgers with the greatest Fury imaginable; insomuch that 2000 French
were killed upon the place, besides a great number of Prisoners, among the
first is the Sieur de Bartillac, the Marquis de Sourdis escaped with great
difficulty with about twelve or fifteen Horse. This happy Expedition has
obliged the French to quit all the Places they held in the lower Diocese,
excepting Rhineberg, and Keyserswert, and retire to Bon.

This little Place as well as Sibourg and Grosenbrouck are of the number, and
we do not hear the French upon Evacuating the the Places beforementioned,
committed those Outrages we might with reason have apprehended. General Barfus
has Posted himself in Nuis, and making Preparations for to drive the Enemy out
of Wesein, Zoest, Artenberg, and other Places, that as yet remain in the
Electorat, and to Block up Bon if they pretend to resist.
