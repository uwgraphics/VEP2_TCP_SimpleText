AN ODE UPON HIS Majesty's Birthday, Set to Music by Dr. Staggins; Performed
at WHITEHALL, November, 1694.
Written by N. TATE, Servant to Their Majesty's.
SPRING, Where are thy Flowery Treasures?
Where the Summer-Joys retreated?
CAESAR's Festival Repeated,
Should renew your blooming Pleasures.
To attend this Happy Morn,
Nature should her self Adorn.
Though the Gaudy Spring be dead,
And the Joys of Summer fled;
Winter has of Ivy store,
Such as Great Alcides wore:
Ivy and Laurel, ever Gay,
Their Verdure keep for CAESAR's Day.
Our Hero's Warmth can sure inspire
Coldest Orbs with vital Fire:
Can absent Phoebus Task perform,
And spite of Winter-Frost and Storm,
Create a Joyful Quire.
Aloud the Joyful Muses call,
Come Celebrate this Festival.
From a Hero, for Valor and Virtue Renowned,
Let Envy retire,
While the Graces conspire,
With Laurel and Myrtle his Brows to surround.
All in one Harmonious Strein;
Dale and Mountain,
Grove and Fountain,
Welcome CAESAR's Birth and Reign.
Britain on CAESAR's Day should Smile;
From Shore to Shore resound with Mirth,
Like Delos at Apollo's Birth
That eased her Grief, and fixed her Floating Isle.
In Rome had such a CAESAR swayed,
Brutus and Cato had Obeyed.
It Is Danger gives a Warrior Fame;
Conquest by Bribes, or Stealth obtained,
Honors true Sons have still disdained:
Adventures Crowned Brave Jason's Name;
And Hercules by Toils o ercame.
But see! the happy Season springs,
That Joyful Peace to Europe brings:
Vast Arrears of Bliss that may
O'er-recompence the long Delay,
And our Alcides Toils repay.
Peaceful Arts shall then renew;
Smiling Ages long ensue,
To Britain's Royal Pair,
(Her Guardian-Angel's Care)
No less Success, no less Rewards are due.
Grand CHORUS.
When Laws are supported, and Monarchs are Mild,
Empire and Freedom are then Reconciled.
