The EPISTLE TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader,
I Did not think to have appeared any more in the World in a Subject of this
Nature, being now far declined in Years; and in that regard, more fit to have
employed the short Remains of my now languishing Taper in such Meditations as
might make me ready to appear before that Tribunal, where those who shall be
thought Worthy, shall know the truth of these things, not by Discourse and
Connection of Consequences, but by that Intuition which shall proceed from the
Author of all Causes and Things, even God himself.

But the Desire of Friends has overruled my own Inclinations, and prevailed
with me to present to thy View and Perusal these ensuing Treatises. The first
contains the Uses of the Analemma, an Old Instrument, but in my Judgment, a
very good one, and by which most Problems in the Solution of Plain or Spherical
Triangles, are Resolved with great Facility, and without much cumber or use of
Compasses. It Is an Instrument easily made, there being only the great Meridian,
which is a Circle, the other Meridians are Ellipses, which by Elliptical
Compasses fitly placed, may be as easily and truly drawn as Circles are with a
Beam or Bow; the other are all straight Lines, and divided Sinically. I have
one newly drawn by me by Hand, upon a Board pasted over with Pastboard, between
nine or ten Inches Diameter, which I have made use of in the Solution of many
Astronomical Problems, with as much Accuracy as can be expected from an
Instrument of that size. Let not any man believe that I go about here to
commend the Use of Instruments any way to stand in Competion with the natural
way of Computation by the Canon, but only as Assistants to those, who being
engaged in great Computations, may easily commit an Error, which an Instrument
well made will soon discover. I shall not describe the manner of making it,
that being sufficiently done by many others. Mr. Blagrave in his Mathematical
Jewel finds fault, that the Meridians toward the Noon-Line are very narrow and
close together. It Is true, they are so, the manner of this Projection of the
Sphere requiring it: but to compensate this, the Reader may consider, that the
Hour-Spaces farther from the Meridian, enlarge themselves where his grow
narrower: nay, where they are broadest, the Parallels in the Matter, and
Almicanters in the Rete will sometimes, run in the same Line, so that it will
be troublesome to find the Meridian you desire. I would not be thought to speak
this in the least manner to lessen the Honor of Mr. Blagrave in his most
excellent Invention of applying a Rete to the Matter of Gemm-Friseus his
Astrolabe; by which Addition the Triangle lies open to your eye, or the careful
Embellishing, I should rather say, new Moulding, or Framing it, by my very
Learned Friend, and Skilful Mathematician Mr. John Palmer, Rector of Ecton, and
Archdeacon of Northampton. But to show the Difficulty in the making it, where
besides the cutting out the Rete, the Circles must exactly agree to one
another, or else the Instrument will be of little Value; which to observe, will
require a greater Care than you will easily persuade a Workman to take. I have
lately had two made for me in Brass, of about eight Inches Diamiter, the one an
Analemma, the other Blagrave's Jewel, both very well made by my very good
Friend Mr. Walter Hays, who does employ and direct the best, or as good Workmen
as any are, to perform what his Age or Infirmity makes him unable to perform
with his own Hands. In this he is much to be commended, that you will very
seldom find him out of Doors, and to be sought in Alehouses or Taverns, where
many a good Workman spends much of his time. The Uses now given thee, were by
me applied to this Instrument many years since, when I was at Paris, about the
Year 1645, which has made me in some of the Examples make use of the Elevation
of the Pole of that Place. Many others I have applied to other Latitudes,
because by various Examples the Precepts will, I think, be made more easy. I
have added two other Tractates, the one called, The Planetary Instrument, by
which the Places of all the Planets, except the Moon, may be easily found out,
and sooner than the Place of any one of them can be found out by the Tables.
The other is a Nocturnal; by which the Hour of the Night may be very accurately
known by any Star in the Meridian. The first was the Contrivance of my Worthy
Friend Mr. Palmer; the other is the Invention of my very good Friend Mr.
Foster, sometime Professor of Astronomy in Gresham-Colledge; both whose
Memories I must ever honor, as Persons to whose Conduct I must acknowledge to
owe a great part of that Knowledge I have attained in these Sciences. Thus,
Reader, thou have my Design and End in the Publication of these Trifles, which
is no other than to Confirm those that are Learned in their further Search into
them, and to facilitate others in the Practice of these most Useful Sciences;
in the Commendation of which I will not now enlarge my self, who shall be glad
to hear these Papers please any; if they have other Fortune, let them pass
among those Idle Pamphlets, under the Burden of which the Press now daily
labors.

THE USE OF THE General Planisphere CALLED THE Analemma, In the Resolution of
some of the Chief and most Useful PROBLEMS of ASTRONOMY.
PROBLEM I. The Sun's Place being given, to find his Declination.
COUNT what Parallel from the Equinoctial does cut the Place of the Sun in the
Ecliptic, for that is the Declination required. So in 00 00 you will find the
11 30 Parallel cuts the Ecliptic.

PROB. II. Contrarily, the Declination being given, to find the Sun's Place.
Count 11 30 among the Parallels, and that will cut 00 00 of.

PROB. III. The Place of the Sun being given, to find his Right Ascension.
Look what Meridian, reckoning from the Center, does pass through the Suns
place, for that in Degrees is the Rig^ Ascension required. So will the Right
Ascension for (...) beginning of be found 27 54. So likewise f^ (...) beginning
of; to which adding 180, because (...) Southern Sign, the Right Ascension will
be found 207 ^

PROB. IV. The Elevation of the Pole, and Degree of the Ecliptic being given,
to find, 1 st. The Ortive Latitude. 2 dly. The Rising and Setting of the Sun. 3
dly. The Semidiurnal Arch.
Place the Finitor to the Latitude, then see what degree thereof does cross the
Sun's Parallel, for the Degree in the Ecliptic given, for that is the Ortive
Latitude sought, being reckoned from the Center, or East point in the
Instrument. So in the Latitude of 49 I find the Ortive Latitude about 38 in the
Tropic of Cancer. 2 dly, The Meridian there passing, shows the Sun's Rising to
be very near four in the Morning. And 3 dly. The Semidiurnal Arch to be 8
hours, and so the longest day there 16 hours.

PROB. V. The same things being given, to find the Ascensional Difference.
The Horizon, as before, being set to the Latitude, count from the Center to
the Meridian that cuts it in the Sun's Place for that day; that is to say, in
the Sun's Parallel for the place of the Eccliptick given. So shall you find the
Ascensional Difference for the beginning of in the foresaid Latitude of 49 to
be 13 32.

PROB. VI. To find the Oblique Ascension.
First, find the Right Ascension by the third Problem, and the Ascensional
Difference by the preceding one. In Northern Signs subduct the Ascensional
Difference out of the Right Ascension, but in Southern Signs add it. So shall
the Sum, or Difference give you the Oblique Ascension required. So in the
beginning of I find the Sun's Right Ascension 27 54, and in the Latitude of 49
00, his Ascentional Difference 13 32, their Difference is 14 22, which is the
Oblique Ascension for the beginning of. So the Oblique Ascension for the
beginning of, will be found 221 26 by adding 13 32 to 207 54, the Right
Ascension before found.

PROB. VII. To find the Oblique Ascension of any other Point in the Ecliptic,
not reckoning from the Aequinoctial points, by which you may know whether the
said Sign does ascend Right, or Obliquely.
By the preceding Problem find the Oblique Ascension for the beginning and end
of, or any other Arch propounded, then subducting the lesser out of the
greater, the residue is the Oblique Ascension required. So in the Latitude of
49 00 I desire to know what degrees of the Aequinoctial do in an Oblique Sphere
ascend between the beginning and end of, I find the oblique Ascension for the
beginning of to be 14 22, and of the latter end 32 45, their Difference is 18
23, the Oblique Ascension required. Where note, because the remaining Sum is
in the Example less than the given Arch, the said Sign does ascend Obliquely,
contrarily if it had been greater.

PROB. VIII. To sind the Hour of the day, the Altitude of the Sun being first
observed.
Set the Ruler to the Latitude, and remove the Vertical till it cross the Sun's
Parallel in the Altitude observed, the Meridian there passing shows the hour of
the day. So in the beginning of in the Latitude of 52 00 I observed the
Altitude 27 18, and the 60 th. Meridian does cross the Sun's Parallel in that
Altitude, therefore it was then eight of the Clock in the Morning. Thus also
may you make a Table of Altitudes for every hour of the day, by removing the
Vertical from hour to hour, and observing the Degrees of Altitude cut off by
the several Meridians.

PROB. IX. To find what Degree of the Ecliptic is in the Meridian at any hour
given.
Find the Right Ascension by the third Problem, then turn the hour given from
the Meridian into degrees and minutes of the Aequinoctial, add unto these the
Right Ascension found, then examine what point in the Ecliptic does answer to
those Degrees of Right Ascension, which is done by following the Meridian,
which shows the Right Ascension up to the Ecliptic, for that part of the
Ecliptic is in the Meridian.

So in the beginning of, and at the hour of nine in the Morning, I find the
Right Ascension 27 54, the hours from the Meridian last past 21 00 in degrees
315, to which I add 27 54, it makes 342 54 which is the Right Ascension for the
11 th. Degree of, or near, which was the degree of the Ecliptic then in the
Meridian, which will be 11 30.

PROB. X. To find the Sun's Azimuth at any Altitude given.
Place the Finitor to your Latitude, and remove the Vertical till it intersect
the Sun's Parallel in the Altitude given, then applying it over in the
Aequinoctial-line, the Meridian which intersects the Vertical in the given
Altitude, shows the Sun's Azimuth, or Distance from the South or East, as you
shall please to account it. So in the Latitude of 48 50, the Sun's Altitude
being 31 40 in the Tropic of. Then moving the Vertical till it cross the
Parallel of in that Altitude, I there find it, and then moving the Horizon over
in the terms of the Aequinoctial, I find that 88 2 Meridian does cross the
Vertical in the Altitude given, which is the Azimuth from the South. Here you
are to take notice, that those which were before Meridians are now become
Vertical Circles in this manner of working.

PROB. XI. To make an Horizontal DIAL.
Set the Horizon or Finitor to the Latitude of that place for which you desire
to make your Dial, and then observe the several Angles made by the Meridians
upon the Horizon, which express upon your Plain, and let your Style make an
Angle equal to the Latitude of your Place for which you make your Dial. This
needs no Example.

PROB. XII. To make an Upright Vertical DIAL.
Set the Ruler to your Latitude, and the moveable Vertical in the Center of
your Instrument, then observe the several Angles made between the 12 of Clock
line and the other Meridians, not upon the Horizon, as you did before; but upon
the Vertical, and those shall be the hour spaces required. So in the Latitude
of 49 the angle of 11 will be 9 57, and also for 1; 20 44 for 10 h. and 2 h. 33
16 for 9 h. and 3 h. and so the rest.

PROB. XIII. To make a Upright Declining DIAL.
For the placing the Style, and drawing the Hour Lines there must necessarily
be resolved a Sperical Rect-angled Triangle, in which there will be given,
beside the Right Angle, the Complement of your plains Declination (which I
allways count from the Pole of the Plain to the North or South Points) and
thirdly, the Complement of your Latitude; by help whereof you may find, 1st.
The Elevation of the Pole above the Plain. 2dly. The distance of the Substyler
from the Vertical in your Plain. And 3dly. The Difference of Longitude, or the
Angle comprehended between the Meridian of the Plain, and Meridian of the
Place. All which will be made plain by the Figure following: in which,

The Scheme following represents a South Plain Declining from the North
Westward 55 30 in the North Latitude 46 12.

scheme The Latitude is 46 12.



Let ENWS be the Horizon of the place and the letters as they are in their
order, mark, the East, North, and West and South points. Let then a plain BC be
given, the pole whereof will be D, the Meridian of the Plain which passes
always through P, the pole of the world, and D the pole of the plain DPR, the
Declination DZN the Complement thereof NZC, the Triangle to be resolved PZR, in
which are given; 1st. PZR the Complement of the Declination: 34 30. 2dly. PZ
the Complement of the Latitude 43 48. 3dly. PRZ the Right Angle.


Things required are,

1 st. PR the Elevation of the Pole above the Plain.

2 dly. ZR the distance of the Substylar from the Vertical, or the angle made
between the Substylar and the Meridian, or line of 12 h.

3 dly. ZPR, the Difference of Longitude, or the angle comprehended between the
Meridian of the Plain, and of the Place.

Now these things are thus found at one Operation by this Instrument.

1 st. Reckon from the Aequinoctial toward the Pole, the Complement of the
Declination of your Plain, which in our Example will be 34 30, at that point
place the Horizontal Ruler, then from the Center of your Instrument toward the
Limb, reckon upon the Horizontal Ruler, the side given PZ the Complement of
your Latitude, and the Parallel there intersecting being reckoned from the
Aequinoctial, shall be PR the Elevation of the Pole above your Plain.

2 dly. The Instrument standing in the same situation, count from the Limb of
your Instrument toward the Center among the Meridians, the Complement of your
Latitude, for the Meridian, there intersecting the Horizon, shall, upon the
Degrees of the Horizon give you ZR, the Distance of the Substylar from the
Meridian of the Place.

3dly. the Parallel of Declination in the common Intersection of the foresaid
Meridian with the Horizon, being numbered from the Pole of the World, does give
you the Angle sought, ZPR, or the difference of Longitude. But because it may
some times fall out, that the said Intersection will be more then 23 30, and in
little Instruments the Parallels not drawn beyond the Tropicks, which are 23
from the Aequinoctial: in that case you may thus help your self: at the common
Intersection make a little spot of ink or red Ocre with your pen, and then
putting the Horizon back to the terms of the Aequinoctial, run the movable
Vertical to the said mark, the degrees of which shall show you the Angle
sought, counted from the Pole of the world; or otherwise place one foot of your
compasses in the said Intersection, and take the nearest Distance between that
and the Aequinoctial, which being applied over, either in the limb, or
Vertical, shall give from the Aequinoctial the Angle required.

EXAMPLE.
In the Latitude of 46 12 a South Plain declines from the North Westward 55 30
I place the Finitor to 34 degrees, 30 minutes upon the Limb, which is the
Complement of my Declination, and is represented by the Arch NC in the Scheme
equal to WD, and from the Center reckon the Complement of the Latitude for
which the Declining Dial is made, Viz. 43 48, and there I find the Parallel 23
05 to meet or intersect 43 28 which is PR, the Elevation of the Pole above the
Plain.

2 dly. In the same situation of the Instrument, reckoning the Complement of my
Latitude among the Meridians, from 12 of the Clock, or first Meridian, I find
the 43 48 Meridian does cut the Horizon in 38 19, which is the Distance of the
Substylar from the Meridian of the Place, Viz. ZR.

3 dly, and lastly, I find from the Pole, the 63 37 Parallel does pass through
that Meridian in its common Intersection with the Horizon, or ZPR the
Difference of Longitude.

These things being thus found, Viz. The Elevation of the Pole above the Plain,
23 05 The Angle of the Substylar, 38 19. The Difference of Longitude, 63 37.

The hour spaces are thus found. By the Difference of Longitude you may know
that the Substylar falls four hours 3 37 from the Meridian, place therefore to
3 37 from the Meridian the Horizontal Ruler upon the Limb, and then reckon from
the Center among the Meridians the Elevation of the Pole above your Plain, and
look what Parallel does intersect that Meridian, and the Horizon; for that
counted from the Equinoctial, is the Angle between the Substylar and the first
hour toward the Meridian, which in our Example will be found to be 1 25 then
remove the Horizon 15 higher, that is to 18 37 upon the Limb, and you shall
find 7 31 among the Parallels intersect the Horizon in the 23 5 Meridian, and
so forth for all the hours on that side of the Substylar. In like manner for
the hours on the other side; set the Fini or to 11 23 in the Limb, and you
shall find the Angle upon the ^lain to be 4 30, then removing it 15 higher, yo
shall fin 10 58, and consequently the rest as they follow.

Lastly, Because the Plain is a South Plain Declining from South Eastward, that
is, from the North Westward, the Style must be placed among the Morning hours
on the Western side, and the Dial will be as follows.

Morning Hours. h. 8 1 25 9 7 15 10 14 35 11 23 57 12 18 19 1 62 48 7 4 30 6 10
38 5 19 01 4 30 28

PROB. XIV. To draw the Hour Lines upon a Reclining Plain, whose Face looks
directly toward the North or South.
Let a Plain be given, reclining from the Zenith toward the North 20 in the
Latitude of 49 00. Here I set the Finitor to the Latitude, and the moveable
Vertical to the Degree of Reclination, reckoning from the Zenith toward that
Pole toward which the Reclination is. As in our Example of 20 Reclination
toward the North Pole, the Meridians there intersecting denote the Horary
Angles, and the Degrees between the Pole and the Vertical, that is to say, in
our Example 22 00 is the Elevation of the Pole above the Plain. This is very
little different from the way of making an upright Vertical Dial, and therefore
needs no Example.

diagram of a spherical triangle
PROB. XV. In any Spherical Triangle whatever, having two sides given with the
Angle comprehended to find the rest.
In the foregoing Triangle BAC let BA be 60, AC 50, and the angle BAC 30.

Reckon on the Limb from the Equator toward the North Pole, and on that side
of your Instrument that is on your Right Hand, one of the sides given, Viz. AC
50, and there place the Horizontal Ruler, and then among the Parallels from the
North count the other side AB 60, and among the Meridians from the Left Hand,
there count the Angle given, Viz. 30 BAC, and at the common Intersection of
that Meridian with the Parallel, place the Moveable Vertical; this being done,
apply the Horizontal Ruler over in the terms of the Aequinoctial, so shall the
Degree in the Vertical, which was before observed, viz. 26, in the common
Intersection of the Meridian with the Parallel, give you among the Parallels,
reckoning from the Pole the Base 26, and among the Meridians, from the utmost
on the Right Hand toward the Left you shall find the Angle C. 103. Now for the
Angle B, count AB 60 in the Limb, and there place the Horizon, and count the
side AC 50 among the Parallels, and among the Meridians toward the Right Hand,
count the Angle given 30, and apply the Vertical to the common Intersection,
then apply the Horizon as before over in the Aequinoctial; so among the
Meridians from the utmost on the Right Hand toward the Left, you shall in the
common Intersection find the Angle unknown B 59 So have you now in your
Triangle the three sides and two Angles, the third Angle may be found either by
letting fall a Perpendicular, or continuation of the sides to a Semicircle

PROB. XVI. To find when the Twilight begins and ends.
The Twilight in the Morning begins when the Sun is distant 18 degrees from the
Horizon, and continues till it Rise; and at Night begins at Sun Set, and
continues till he is 18 degrees below the Horizon, and the^ Darkness begins.

To find this, you must know the Place of the Sun, and his Declination. The
Sun's Place may be known by most Almanacks, or by a Scale, which may be annexed
to any convenient Place in the Instrument. The 2 d. to wit, the 's Declination,
is found by the first Problem.

Example First. If the be in the Aequinoctial, he has no Declination; if you
therefore place the Finitor to the Latitude of your Place, move your Vertical
till the 18 th. degree thereof crosses the Aequinoctial, and mark what Meridian
that is, counting from the Center of your Planisphere, which in the Latitude of
52 degrees, you will find to be the 30 th. Meridian; so that you may conclude
the Twilight begins two hours before Rise, and at Night ends two hours after
Set.

But if the have Declination, you must observe that Meridian which crosses the
18 th. degree of the Vertical in the Parallel of Declination.

Example. Suppose the to be in 00 00 in the Latitude of 52 00. When the has 20
of Declination, and observe the Intersection made by the 18 th. degree of the
Vertical, and the 20 th. Parallel of Declination, and there you may observe the
33 Meridian, or thereabout, from Rising, passing which shows the Twilight
will then end, to wit, 2 hours and 12 before the should rise, but at this time
you will find the is up, which teaches you there is then no Twilight at all. So
in the Winter, the Sets so much before 8 h. that it will not come to be 18
degrees below the Horizon till Rise, and will continue so till the comes back
to, there will be no dark time in that Latitude, if the Sky be not Cloudy.

PROB. XVII. Of Spherical Rect-angled Triangles in all their Varieties.
I have in the third and ^ourth Problems foregoing, showed you the Solution of
some Questions, wherein the Triangle has been Rect-angled and Spherical. I
shall now handle the Use of them more fully, and show you how three parts, that
is, two beside the Rectangle, which is always known, being given; the other
parts sought, either Sides or Angles may be by this Planisphere many ways
concluded, as will appear in Practice.

1. In the Scheme. BC 60 00 Data. BA 57 48 Rad.

2 Or, BC 60 00 Data. CA 20 12 Rad.

diagram of a triangle

The Data in the Triangle in our following Geniture are 3 00 Long. 1 Declin.
with the Rect. and the Angle at C will be found 66 32, which will be
demonstrated by the Scheme, N 4.

The Proportions in Trigonometry are thus: BC Rad. BA.C Scheme 1. Or, CA.
Scheme 2.

PC Rad. PD.C. That is, As the Cosine of the Declination given is to the
Radius, so is the Cosine of the greatest Declination to the Angle sought.

In the Triangle BAC Rect-angled, at A the Longitude, BC is 60 00; the Right
Ascension may be found by Problem 3 d. 57.48, and the Angle at B 23 30. Now to
find the Declination, do thus: Choose out the 57 48 Meridian, and then move the
Horizontal Ruler till the 60 th. degree from the Center meets the 57 48
Meridian, which you will find will be 20 12 the Declination sought, if you
count the Parallels from the Aequinoctial till the Intersection is made in the
57 and 48 Meridian: or if you have the Declination given, bring down the
Horizontal Ruler to the Aequinoctial, and you will find the 57 48 of the Ruler
will be cut by the 57 48 Meridian.

But we still want the Angle C; to obtain this, we must turn the Triangle, and
as in the annexed Scheme, diagram of a triangle call BA 20 12 and AC 57 48:
choose now the 20 12 Meridian, and remove the Horizontal Ruler till the
Longitude given, Viz. 60 does intersect the 20 12 Meridian, then count from the
Aequinoctial upon the Limb the Degrees cut off by the Ruler, which you will
find to be 77 43, for the Acute Angle at C, and its Supplement 113 17 will be
the Obtuse Angle. So you have all the Angles and Sides of your Triangle.

Though I have a very low opinion of Astrology, especially as our
Genethliacall-men, or rather Fortune Tellers use it; yet that I may show the
excellent use of this Planisphere, and because it may be useful to know the
figure of the Heavens in Eclipses, and the Ingress of the Sun into the
Aequinoctial points: I shall now show you how to place the 12 Houses with the
Signs to them belonging. In this I shall take for Example ageniture long since
past, and not agreeable to any Example before given, that by variety of
Operations the Reader may better comprehend the use of the Instrument.

PROB. XVIII. How to erect a Figure of the Heavens.
First for the time propounded you must first find the Suns place, that is, in
what Degree of the Ecliptic the Sun is in at the time proposed; and afterward,
in the following Example; I shall teach you to find the Medium-Coeli, or that
degree of the Ecliptic that is in the Meridian.

EXAMPLE.
Suppose a Geniture to be upon the ninth day of December, at six of the Clock
in the Evening, in the Year 1571. The place of the Sun was then found 27 17 of,
and his Right Ascension will be found 267 Add to this 90 which is six hours
after Noon in the degrees of the Aequinoctial, which will give you the Right
Ascension of the Mid-heaven, Viz. 357 to which will answer 27 or rather 26 46;
for the Medium-Coeli, and his opposite 27 or 26 46 of for the Imum-Coeli, so
you have the 10th and 4th House found,

Your next work will be to find the degree of the Ecliptic, which will be in
the Ascendant for the Latitude [Lat. 53 00] of the place of Birth. Now by
adding 90 to the Right Ascension of the Mid-heaven, you will have the Oblique
Ascension of the Ascendant: In our Example the Right Ascension of the
Mid-heaven is 357, to which, by adding 90 the Sum will be 447; out of which
take 360, the residue will be 87, which is the Oblique Ascension of the
Ascendant. Now to know to what Degree of the Eccliptick this belongs, must be
known by a Table of Oblique Ascensions fitted to your Latitude, which you may
make by the fifth and sixth Problem, but it is better to take it out of the
Table at the end of this Treatise, where the Oblique Ascension may be found for
every Degree of the Eccliptick for several Latitudes; by which you may see,
that in 53 of Latitude, the Oblique Ascension 87 will be between the 25 or 26
of, the Ascendant will be in between 25 and 26.

The Ascending Signs, Descendant.

By this you may know the four Cardinal Points or Angles, to wit, the 10 th.
the 1st. the 4 th. and the Seventh. By which all Questions of Life, Parents,
Marriage, and Preferment, or Honor are (according to their Rules) foretold

PROB. XIX. In order to find the Cusps of the other Houses, diverse Spherical
Triangles are to be Resolved.
We had before showed how to find the Angle between the Meridian and the
Eccliptick, to be 66, by Prob. 7. which we shall now find another way.

The Degree culminating, or the Medium-coeli was 26, and consequently its
Distance from was 3; count therefore 3 among the Meridians, from the utmost
toward the Center, then remove the Horizontal Ruler downward toward the
Antartick Pole, the Fiducial Edge of the Vertical remaining fixed at the Center,
till such time as the Vertical shall cross the 3 Meridian in the Artick Circle,
that is, in the 23 Parallel from the Pose, and in the Limb you shall meet the
66, which is the Angle between the Meridian and the Eccliptick.

2 dly. Things standing all in this Posture, look from the extremity of the
Vertical Ruler to the 3 Meridian, there you will find 1 crossing, which is the
Declination of the Mid-heaven Southward; take this out of 37 the Complement of
your Latitude, there rests 35 30, which is the Altitude of the Mid-heaven, or
the Degree culminant, because the Declination is Southward, otherwise it must
have been added.

3 dly. Number 35 30 from the extremity of the Vertical, and this will, among
the Parallels from the Pole, show about 42, or thereabout, which is the Angle
made between the Eccliptick and the Horizon.

4 thly. Count among the Meridians from the utmost to that point, and you shall
find the 61st. Meridian there, which is the degree of the Eccliptick between
the Meridian and the Horizon.

Lastly, You shall find the same Degrees of the Eccliptick, ( Viz. 61) if you
count the 35 or thereabout, from the Center for those Degrees of the Ruler will
show you 61, as before.

Thus we have obtained, 1. The Degree Culminant, 26 2. The Angle between the
Meridian and the Eccliptick. 66 3. The Distance of the Point Culminant from 03.
4. The Declination of the Mid-Caeli. 01. 5. The Altitude or the Mid-Caeli. 35.
6. The Angle between the Eccliptick and the Horizon, 42. 7. The same Degrees,
that is to say, of the Eccliptick and Horizon two ways, 61.

All these things will be made plain by the following SCHEMES.

Angle at A, the greatest Declination at B, the present Declination at the

have given HL, the height of the Mid-Caeli, with the two Angles at O and L, by
which LG may be found by Trigonometry, according to the Rules delivered by
Artists, by letting fall a Perpendicular either within or without the Triangle,
when two Angles and the adjacent side is given. In this manner you may set a
Figure of the 12 Houses, which will be near as the Figure adjoining.

FOrasmuch as the Practice of Astronomy depends much upon the exact making of
the Instruments; These are to give notice, that these, and all other
Instruments for the Mathematical Practice, are accurately Made and Sold by Mr.
Walter Hayes, at the Cross-Daggers in Moor-Fields, next Door to the
Popes-Head-Tavern, London; where they may be furnished with Books to show the
Use of them: As also with all sorts of Maps, Globes, Sea-Plats,
Carpenters-Rules, Post, and Pocket-Dials for any Latitude, at Reasonable Rates.

THE Planetary Instrument. OR THE Description and Use of the Theories of the
Planets: drawn in true Proportion, either in one, or two Plates, of eight
Inches Diameter; by Walter Hayes, at the Cross-Daggers in Moor-Fields.
Being excellent Schemes to help the Conceptions of Young Astronomers; and
ready Instruments for finding the Distances, Longitudes, Latitudes, Aspects,
Directions, Stations, and Retrogradations of the Planets; either Mechanically,
or Arithmetically; with Ease and Speed.
By Mr. John Palmer, Rector of Ecton, and Archdeacon of Northampton.
The DESCRIPTION.
THE first Plate (which I call Saturn's Plate) contains the Theories of: also
short, but sufficient Tables of their Anomalies; and a Scale for measuring
their Distances in Semidiameters of the Earth.

The second Plate (which I call Mars's Plate) contains the Theories of, with
like Tables of their Anomalies, and Scale of Distances.

The Sun is in the Center of the Plate. The other Planets have their several
Eccentrics and Orbits. These should be Ellipses, but Circles will serve
sufficiently, especially for Instruments. Mr. S. Foster disposed these Planets
in four Plates, and added thereto other Devices, to be seen in a Book published
since his Death. Here they are all contrived in two Plates, or two sides of one
Plate: and whereas Mr. F. supposed the Apheliums and Nodes moveable, in these
Thories they are fixed, according to Mr. Street's Hypothesis: by which means,
though they be framed to the end of 1680, yet not only for this Age, but (with
allowance of the Procession of the Aequinoctial) they may serve perpetually.

The Aphelium of a Planet is the point of his Eccentric, which is furthest from
^he Sun, and from Aphelium is the Anomaly counted.

The Anomaly is the circular Distance of a Planet from his Aphelium. But though
the Anomalies be equal, yet their Divisions in every Eccentric are unequal,
because they are made to contain the Aggregates of the Anomalies, and
Prosthaphoreses of the Orb compounded together.

Where you see two or three pricks on one side the Orbit, and on the other
side, there the Planet goes into North Latitude, and at the opposite Point over
the Center, is the Place of, where he goes into South Latitude.

The Use of the THEORIES.
This shall be shown in three Examples only, which may suffice.
But, Note 1. That I begin the Years and Days 24 hours later than Mr. Street;
for I count the last day of December to end in the Noon of the Circumcision;
which is the old way: and to that Account these Theories and Tables are fitted:
and all Years and Days here are counted Complete.

Note 2. That in gathering the Anomalies out of the Tables, if the same exceed
a Circle, (or 360) you must by Subtraction, or Division, cast away all whole
Circles, take the Remainder for the Anomaly sought. The Numbers in the Tables
are Degrees, and Centesimal parts, and for the Diurnal Motion, another Figure
is added, to make the Parts Millesimal. In the Tables, A. stands for Anni, that
is, Years: D. stands for Days: Incl. stands for Inclination; which is set down
in Degrees and Minutes.

EXAMPLE. I.
1675. April 1. I saw Mars above the foremost foot of Apollo, and he seemed to
be much diminished in Magnitude.

First out of the Table for. For. write out for 1672 194.59. 259.51. for two
Years more 359.75. 191.27. 359.75. 191.27. for 90 days the product of 986 by 90
is 88.74. 524 in 90 47.16. 1002.83. 689.21. for 2 Circles deduct 720. deduct
360. Anomaly of 282.83. Anomaly of 329.21.

Now in the Earths Orbit, at 283, make a prick with Ink for; for there is for
this time: and likewise prick in his Orbit at 329.

Lay a Ruler from the Place of over the (in the Center) and it shall cut in the
Limb 21 38, the 's Longitude. Again, lay a Ruler from to (I mean, the pricks
set for them) and know, that a Line Parallel to your Ruler, passing through the
(or Center) will cut in the Limb the Longitude of.

Take therefore with your Compasses the nearest distance of the Center from the
Ruler, and let one foot slide along the Ruler from to, and beyond him; and let
the other foot, keeping even pace with his fellows, pass from the Center to the
Limb, and so it shall touch in the Limb 29, the Longitude of.

Another way. Mark well the Triangle made by your two Pricks and the Center,
that is, by and. Measure the sides upon your Scale, and you shall find 3500
Semid. of 5700 6000

Now if you have 2 Thrids from the Center, and lay one upon, and the other
upon, the Arch of the Limb between them, is the Measure of the Angle at the,
(or of Commutation) and is here 77 42. With this Angle and the Sides
comprehending it (which are 35 and 57, as before) you may by Pitiscus his third
Axiom, Calculate the other Angles, and find Ang. at (or Elongation) 67. 41,
and Ang. at (or Paralloxis Orbis) 34 37. The Elongation of (67 41) added to the
Long. of ( 21 38) makes the Long. of, 89.17. that is 29.17.

Another way. Transfer your Triangle upon Paper, and there, by help of a Scale
of Chords, or a small Quadrant, and Compasses, you may easily find all the
Angles very near the truth; Viz. Ang. ad 77 42. Ang. ad 67 54. Ang. ad 34 24.

Note, That the reason of his Diminution is the Increase of his Distance from
the Earth; for you may measure it upon the Plate 6000: but in his he may be
distant but 1320, and never above 2350.

For the Latitude of, lay one Third from the Center to, and another Third to,
the Arch of the Limb intercepted by the Thrids (76.10.) is Argumentum
Latitudinis.

Now as the Radius to the Tang. of 1.52, the Inclination of: So is the Sine of
76.10 to the Tang. of 1.49; the North Latitude of seen at the Sun.

And as to; so is the Tang. of the Lat. at the Sun, to 1.44; the Tang. of Lat.
seen at the Earth.

EXAMPLE II.
1677. October. 28. (being St. Simon and Jude's) at Noon. ^ seek Place.

1672. 194.59 155.83 A. 4. (or 4 Years) 359.98 218.90 Days 300 295.80 147.60

Prick the and in their Orbits, at the end of these Anomalies, and you shall
see the Prick for fall in the very Node at; and laying a Third, or Ruler from
the Center to or, it shall cut them both, and show that is in a Corporal
Conjunction with. This would be observed: for by the help of fit Glasses, may
be seen in the for several hours; and according to the best Tables, he shall
pass within 4 or 5 minutes of the 's Center in North Lat.

EXAMPLE III.
1673. May 25. In the day time I saw with a Telescope, horned like the at 3 or
4 days old; and though she was so much waned, she appeared bigger and brighter
than at any time since she came last out of the Sunbeams.

1672. 194.59 62.54. 144 days. 141.98 230.69 Anom. 336.57 Anom.. 293.23

Prick these Planets in their Anomalies, as before was taught. Lay a Ruler from
over the Center, and it shall cut in the Limb the Long. of the, 14.11. The
Ruler thus lying, draw a Third from the Center over. Now between the Ruler and
the Third is the Angle of Commutation (163) and there adjoyneth to it the
Supplement thereof (17) which in your Triangle is Angulus ad, and is measured
by the Limb.

Lay your Ruler from to, and the Parallel Line made, or imagined to be made,
with your Compasses through the Center, will cut 17; the Long. of, and the Arch
between this and the 's Place before found, is the Elongation of from
Eastwards, 32.49. And the Sum of the Commutation and Elongation taken out of
180, leaves the Angle at 130.11.

Another way. In the Triangle, you may take all the sides in your Compasses,
and measure them upon the Scale, that is, 3520. 2450. and 1370. Then either by
Protraction find the Angles: or, the Angle of Commutation being known (17) and
the sides including by Ax. 3. Pitisci, you may compute the Angle at the 32.49
and the Angle at 130.11.

This Angle at measures her Waxing and Waning.

Let the Radius be 100, the Diameter of 200, the Angle being 130.11, the versed
Sine thereof (165) measures the dark part of the Diameter; the residue (35) is
light: So is Waned 165/200 of her Diameter; that is almost 10 Digits; and yet
she seems much bigger than when she was Full: because 2 Digits of light in her
present Distance (of 1370) contain more Seconds of light than her full Disk
could contain; when coming from the, she was distant about 6000, as you may
measure upon the Plate.

How these Plates may be also useful for Observing Altitudes, Azimuths,
Declinations, and Inclinations of Plains, etc. They who have any Skill in the
Mathematics, may easily discern without further Admonition.

FINIS.
The Description and Use of the NOCTURNAL; By Mr. Samuel Foster, late Reader of
Astronomy in Gresham-Colledge.
With the Addition of a Ruler, showing the Measures of Inches and other Parts
of most Countries, compared with our English ones; Being useful for all
Merchants and Tradesmen.
THIS Nocturnal is made of two Plates; the thick Plate (which I call the Matter)
and a Moveable Plate, representing the Aequinoctial. On the Matter, the Circle
does represent the Eccliptick. All the rest of the Writing, is the Names of as
many of the F^xed Stars as the bigness of the Instrument will give leave. To
these must be added an Index or Label, fastened at the Center, to cut the
several Circles upon the Instrument.

The Use of the Nocturnal.
1. SET the Label to the Sun's Place in the Zodiac, and the Hour of Twelve in
the Aequinoctial to the Star, whose time of coming to the Meridian you enquire
after; and then look what hour and minute is cut by the Label in the
Aequinoctial, for that is the hour of the Day or Night that the same Star will
come to the South Part of the Meridian.

But you must observe, that the hours are marked in the Aequinoctial in this
manner, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Now the Difficulty lies, in
finding whether the minutes you shall find cut by the Label in the
Aequinoctial, does belong to the upper row of hours, Viz. 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or
to the under row, Viz. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11; and whether from Noon, or from
Midnight: In order to this you must know in what Sign the Star is that you
observe, and take notice how far it is distant from the Place where the is that
day; if it be not above three whole Signs, the Minute cut by the Label,
belongs to the upper row of hours to be accounted from Noon; and if the
Distance of the Star, and of the be four, five, or six Signs, then the said
Minute cut by the Label belongs to the under row of hours, accounted also
from Noon: but if the Distance of the and Star be 7, 8, or 9 Signs, then the
Minute belongs to the upper row of hours accounted from Midnight. Lastly, if
the Distance of the and Star be 10, 11, or 12 Signs then the Minute belongs
to the under row of hours, accounted from Midnight. All which beforesaid shall
be made clear by Examples.

Example the first. The being in the beginning of, when will Spica come to the
Meridian? Set the Label to the beginning of, and the hour 12 in the
Aequinoctial to Spica then will the Label cut the 59 th. Minute after 4, or
after 10; now this Star being in, which is not above three Signs from, it must
be after 4 of the Clock from Noon. I conclude then that the being in the
beginning of, the Spica will come to the Sonth at 4h. 59 past Noon.

Example II. When will the same Star come to the Meridian, the being in the 10
th. degree of? The Label being set to the 10 of, and 12 to the Star, as before,
the Label shall cut the 35 Minute after 2 or 8; now it must be after 8, because
the is above three Signs distant from the Star, and yet not seven Signs; so
Spica will come to the Meridian at 8h. 35 past Noon.

Example III. When will the same Spica come to the Meridian, the being in the 5
th. Degree?

The Label being set to the 5 of, shall cut 41 after 2, or 8; but it must be 2,
and after Midnight past, because the distance of the and the Star is above six
whole Signs, and not nine.

Example IV. Working after the same manner, you will find that the same Star
will come to the Meridian at 9 h. 58 past Midnight, the being in the 20 00 of.
I take the lower row of hours, and say, that it is after Midnight, because the
is above nine Signs distant from the Star. NB. These Precepts are fitted to an
Instrument made for 1671.

Additions to the Instrument, in Brass, made by Mr. R. Aug. 1st. 1684.
Calculated for the Year 1700, which will make some little difference in the
aforesaid Precepts.
IF in this Instrument you set down to the several Stars their respective
several Declinations, and by adding either an A, or B, according to the
Declination of either Austral or Boreal, you shall have the height of the Star
when it comes to the Meridian, Viz. by adding the Declination to the height of
the Aequinoctial, when the said Declination is Northward, and by taking the
Declination from the height of the Aequinoctial when the Declination is
Southward.

diagram of a nocturnal

As for Example. Suppose I desire to know when Cor shall come to the Meridian,
what will be his Altitude in the Latitude of London 51 30. The height of the
Aequinoctial is 38 30, to which add the Stars North Declination, 13 02 38 30 13
02 the Sum is 51 32 the Altitude required.

So the Altitude of the Spica in the Meridian will be found to be 28 57 in the
same Latitude; for the height of the Aequinoctial is 38 30; from which take the
Stars South Declination 9 33, the Remainder is 28 57.

I have so contrived this Instrument, that by making two little square holes in
the Moveable Plate, the first shows you in what Sign the Star is, which is
absolutely necessary to be known, to judge of the distance between the and the
Star (as you have been taught before) and the second shows the Magnitude of the
Star.

To know at any time proposed, what Point of the Eccliptick is in the Meridian.
Suppose the to be in the beginning of, I desire to know what Degree of the
Eccliptick shall be in the Meridian at 15 past Five in the Afternoon.

I lay the hour given to the Sun's Place, and then I find over against the 12 a
Clock line of the Aequinoctial, 15 20 of; and that is the Degree that was then
in the Meridian.

To know when any of the Planets shall come to the Meridian.
The Planets, because of their continual changing of Place, cannot be set fixed
in this Nocturnal: Nevertheless, if at any time you desire to know their time
of coming to the Meridian, you must look in some Ephemeris for the Place of the
Planet, and according as you find it, set it with Black-Lead on your
Instrument, which if it be in Brass, shall be easily put out. The Planet thus
set, shall be as a Fixed Star, and its time of coming to the Meridian found
out, as that of any of the Fixed Stars.

But Note, that if it be the Moon that you observe, you must allow about a
degree for every two hours past since Noon; and thus you shall have her true
Place; for the Ephemeris gives you her Place only at Noon.

For Example. When will the Moon come to the Meridian on January the 1 st.
1684/5?

The is then in 22 5, and the Moon in 10 12. Now placing ^e Moon on my
Instrument in 10 12, I find that the Moon shall come to the Meridian at a
little past 5 in the Afternoon: and because there are five hours past since
Noon, I must for these five hours allow two degrees and a half to the Moon's
Place, and so set it to 13 00* which being done, I shall find the Moon's true
hour of coming to the Meridian, and that is at about 5 h. 15 past Five in the
Afternoon.

Hitherto is the Instrument general to all those that live on this side the
Aequioctial; and may serve to any Intelligent Man that shall have South
Declination.

But besides, I have made two little Windows in the Moveable Plate, but the
Figures of them are Calculated for the Meridian of London, or any other Place
that is under the same Latitude of 51 30.

The first Window shows the Semi-Nocturnal Arch of the Star in Hours and
Minutes; and the Use of it is to know the time of the Stars Rising and Setting,
as also how long it continues above the Horizon.

First. For the Rising, take the Semi-Nocturnal Arch from the time of the Stars
coming to the Meridian, and the Remainder gives you the time of the Stars
Rising. So the being in the beginning of, the Spike of the Virgin comes to the
Meridian at 9 h. 18 after Noon, from which take the Stars 5 11, Semi-Nocturnal
Arch, there remains 4 07, which is the time of the Stars Rising in the
Afternoon.

Secondly, For the Setting, add the Semi-Nocturnal Arch to the time of coming
to the Meridian, and the Sum gives the time of the Stars Setting.

So on the same day, the being in the beginning of, the Spike of the Virgin
coming to the Meridian at 9 h. 18 if you add to it the Star's Semi-nocturnal
Arch, 5 11 the Sum is 14 h. 29 past Noon, or 2 h. 29 past Midnight.

Thirdly, For the time of the Stars being above the Horizon, double the
Semi-Nocturnal Arch, and the Sum is the time of the Star's being above the
Horizon.

The other Window shows the Star's Amplitude in Degrees and Minutes, which is
counted f^ the East toward the North, when the Star's Declination is North;
and from the East to South, when the Declination is South: Where note, that the
Stars Set at the same Distance from the West that they Rise from the East.

This Instrument was first invented by Mr. Samuel Foster, and given to me,
drawn upon Pastboard by his own hand, which is still in my Power; but the
Additions to it were put in by an Ingenious Gentleman of the French Nation, and
by him drawn in Brass, which I received from him, and will keep for his Sake.

The following Table is made to insert all the Stars expressed there according
to their Right Ascensions, which is fourfold as great as the true is, the
Nature of the Instrument requiring it to be so; because the Aequinoctial, which
should be divided into twenty four hours, is divided but into six hours.
