A Trick for Tyburn: OR A PRISON RANT. BEING A SONG of the Prisoners of
Newgate, at the JAIL-DELIVER.
To the Tune of Hark the Thundering Canons Rore
TRumpets sound and Steeples Ring
Every Loyal Subject Sing,
With a Health to James our King
For his Pardon granted.
Prisoners half Dead that lay,
Closed in Stone, in stead of Clay,
Have their Liberty to Day,
Which before they wanted.
Newgate lately did bring forth
Seventy Children at a Birth,
All in Wantonness and Mirth,
At a Jail-deliver.
But her Keepers they Ly In,
Money sick for want of Sin;
They will look both Pale and Thin,
Till a new Recovery.
Now the Doors are open wide,
Jack may take his Mare and Ride;
With a Leg on every side;
And the Jade be flinging.
Take her Halter Ketch, and try
What Is the nearest course to Die;
And we'll write thine Elegy,
He Is Hanged for want of Hanging.
Henceforth we will Steal no more,
Tho we should be never so Poor,
If (by chance) we take a Whore
In single Fornication.
We Get a Soldier to the King,
Or a Seaman who does bring
From the Indies every thing,
It does not Wrong the Nation.
We were Rebels (more than Base)
To abuse an act of Grace:
We'll never do it in any Case;
We'll Legal be and Loyal.
If the French begin to Reel,
English Hearts are true as Steel;
We'll make their Breasts our Bullets feel
For James our King the Royal.
Should our Case be never so bad,
We will never be so mad
As to go upon the Pad,
Whilst our Life endures
This Rogue that was a great Trapan,
Is two parts turned a Civil Man,
And honestly Drinks off his Can,
And nothing deadly fears.
We wish that those that cannot pay
Their Debts, may have a Jubiley;
That Poor Men for the King may Pray
At his Great Coronation.
To see the Usurers go Mourn
And take with Jack a second Turn,
When their Bills and Bonds they Burn;
Would over-joy the Nation.
Whitington did build an House
Enough to Starve a Rat or Mouse,
But left Allowance for a Louse,
To give Poor Men the Fever.
But James the Great has found a way
To turn his Scepter to a Key,
And give his Children all the Play;
God Bless him then for Ever.
