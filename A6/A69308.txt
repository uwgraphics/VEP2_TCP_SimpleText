A proclamacion, that (...) the kings subjects shall transport or carry any
kind of grain or other vitailes over the seas, without the kings special
license, under the great seal of England.
WHERE THE kings most royal maiestee, by his gracis proclamacion bearyng
date at Westim^, the.xix. day of April, last paste, did give license to all
and syngular his subjects, that they at their libertees and free wylles from
time to time, should embarke ship and carry over the seas, at their own
adventure, for the furniture of his gracis Camp at the new haven wheat,
malte, rye, and all such other kinds of grain and victualles, as they or any
of them would, unto such time as his highness by his proclamation should
determyne the contrary. For as much as at this present (thanks be to almighty
god) there is passed concluded and agreed a good perfytte sincere fyrme assured
and perpetual amitee and peace, to remain and continue for ever between his
most excellent maiestee, and the right high and mighty prince the french
king, by reasone whereof, it shall not be needful, that so great quantitees
of grain and other victuals be conueyde over the seas, as in the time of the
war were necessary: His hyghnes therefore myndyng to provide, that his pieces
on that side the sea, may from hensforthe be furnysihed in such order, as the
same breed no lack or scarsitee in this realm, doothe by the advice of his
most honorable counsel, straightly charge and command all and syngular
his subjects, of what estate degree or condition so ever they be, that they ne
any of them, shall after the publyshyng of this his highness proclamation
transporte or carry over the seas, to the said new haven, or else where, any
manner kind of grain or other victualles, without his highness special
license to be had and obtained for the same, under his great seal of
England, upon pain not only to incurre-all such penaltees as by the
statutes and proclamacions be provided in that behalf, but also to be further
punysshed by imprisonemente of their bodies, and otherwise by fine and ransom
at his maiestees will and pleasure, to the terrible exaumple of all other.
Wyllyng and commandyng all and syngular his Justices of peace, Mayres,
Shireffes, bailiffes constables, customers, comptrollers, and serchers, and all
other his gracis officers, ministers, and subjects, to whom in this case it
shall apperteyne, to see that this proclamation be duly and without respect
observed, as they woll answer at their extreme perilles.

AND TO THE intent the same may be the better and more certainly kept,
according to the true meaning thereof, his maiestee straightly charge and
commands all and singular his customers comptrollers and serchers of this
realm, that they permit no kind of grain, or other vitayles to be shypped
and transported from one port countreie or shyre to an another, within the same
realm, but that the party, which shall so ship and convey the same, do
first bind him self by obligacion in the treble value of the said corn or
other victuals, that he shall only carry the same to that place, which he
shall name and appoint in the condition of his obligacion, and from thens bring
a certificate under the hands of the mayre, the customer and comptroller of
the town and port, where he shall vnshyppe it, or of two of them at the
least, within four months after that he has delivered the same there, to
be there, and in those parties of the realm employed, and not else where,
without faylyng, as they woll answer for that which shall pass contrary to
this order, upon like pain as is before rehearsed.
