Certain grammar questions for the exercise of young Scholars in the learning
of the Accidence.

The first part of Grammar.
Q. What book do you learn?
R. Mine Accidence.

Q. What book is that?
R. It is the first book which we use to learn to teach us the grounds and
principal rules of Grammar.

Q. What is Grammar?
R. It is an art which teaches the right and due order of speech as well in
writing as in speaking?

Q. How many parts of Grammar be there?
R. Some good writers make but two, but we commonly reckon four?

Q. Which be they?
R. These.

1 Orthographia. 2 Etymologia. Syntaxis. 4 Prosodia.
Q. What words be these.
R. They be Greek words.

Q. Why do ye rehearse them in Greek words?
R. Because there is no fit terms used for them in English.

Q. How be they termed in Latin?
R. The same words be used also in Latin.

Q How chance the Latins in teaching of this art do use Greek terms?
R. Because the Romans whose speech was Latin had the knowledge of the
learned arts from the Greeks, and for that at the first they had not devised
in the Latin tongue fit words to express the meaning of these Greek terms,
therefore they kept still the greek words, not only in Grammar but also in
all the other liberal Sciences.

Q. What mean you by Orthographia?
R. It may be called in Latin recta scriptura, in English true writing?

Q. What do you learn in this part of Grammar?
R. It teaches the perfect order that is to be used in writing and reading.

Q. How many things are to be observed for the right order of writing.
Five, that is to say,

1 Letters. 2 Dipthongs. 3 Syllabells. 4 Words. 5 Distinctions of words and
sentences.
Q. What call ye a letter?
R. A letter is every several figure that is written in a word.

Q. How many letters have ye?
R. In english we use 24. a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h. i. k. l. m. n. o. p. r. s.
t. v. w. x. y. z. The Latins leave out k. y. Because they be more usual to
the Greeks. They leave out also w. for it is a letter proper to our English
tongue. And though they use h. in many words, yet they count it not a letter
but only the mark of a breathed vowell: so that the Latins in deed have but
20. proper letters.

Q. How be your letters divided?
R. Into vowels and consonants.

Q. How many be vowels?
R. These five, a e i o u. and the Greek y.

Q. Why be they called vowels?
R. They be so called of this word vox, which signifies a voice: for that no
other letters do make any voice in sounding without some of these joined with
them.

Q. Why what spelleth prs?
R. Nothing, because there is never a vowell among those letters.

Q. How many letters be called consonantes?
R. All other saving these six vowells.

Q. Why be they called consonantes?
R. They be so called a consonando. That is to say of sounding together,
because that of themselves they give no certain sound, but must be sounded
together with the vowels.

Q. How be your consonantes divided?
R. Thus.

Some be called.

1 Mutes, or dumme letters. 2 Semiuocales, or half vowels. 3 Liquides, or
mylde and melting letters. 4 Double consonantes.
Q. How many be called Mutes?
R These niene. b c d f g k p q t.

Q. Why be they so called?
R. Because that of themselves they have no manner of sound, and therefore in
pronouncing ye add unto them this vowell e. or a. as be. ce. de. ka. etc.

Q. How many be called Semiuocales, or half vowels?
R. These seven. l. m. n. r. s. x. z.

Q. Why be they so called?
R. Because every one of them has as it were half a sound of it self.

Q. How many be called Liquides, or myld and melting letters?
R. Forsooth four of those Semiuocales. That is l. m. n. r.

Q. Why be they so called?
R. Either because they sound not so hard in pronouncing: Or else, because
when one of them stands in a word next after any of the Mutes it makes
the vowell going before to be either long or short.

Q. How many be called Double consonantes?
R. These two. x. and z.

Q. Why be they so called?
R. Because they be made of two consonantes, and stand for two consonantes in
speech. As x stands for cs. or gs. and z. for ds. or ts. or as some think
for ss.

Q. To what use serve these letters?
R. They serve to express in writing the words that a man thinks to speak.

Q. How do ye know with what letters to write a word?
R. That is best learned by use. But in the vowelles the sound will teach ye
which is to be used, and in the consonantes the framing of the tongue in
speaking will bring ye to the letter.

Q. What special notes have ye for the placing of your letters in writing?
R. These.

1. The first letter of every word that begins a sentence and the first
letter of every proper name must be written with a bigger letter the^ the other
words, and those bigger letters are commonly called Capital letters. 2 Betwixt
m and n ye shall never write p. 3 In Latin after x ye shall never write s. 4
In all simple words these letters following must always be joined and spelled
with the vowell that comes after them. bd. ct. ps. st. cn. gm. gn. st. x. 5
In compounding of words ye must always take heed to make good sound, which
the Greeks call Euphonia and therefore sometime some letters are to be put out,
sometime others are to be put in, sometime those are to be changed.
Q. How prove ye that?
R. For Example. Of ob and curro I compound one verb which I write not
obcurro, but occurro. Euphoniae gratia that is for good soundes sake. So for
Absfero I write aufero. and for conlego I write colligo.

Q. Now, What call ye a Dipthong?
R. It is a greek word and signifies a double sound. And it is the placing
of two vowels in one syllable which must be pronounced both together.

Q. How many dipthonges have ye?
R.Among the Latins there be commonly used these five.

ae as musae. au as audio. oe as coelum. ei as hei. eu as euge.
And in english we use these ten.

ai. or ay. gain. au. or aw. gawde. ea for e full. great. ee or ie for i small.
grief. ei or ey height. ew. lewd. oi or oy. joy. ou or ow. loud. ui for i
broad. guide. oo. good.


Q. Now. What call ye a syllable?
R. It is a greek term, and may signify in english a coupling. For it is
the coupling of vowels and consonantes that are to be pronounced together
without breaking of the sound, as if it were but one letter.

Q. Must there needs be a vowell in every syllable?
R. Yea. Or else there is no sound.

Q. Can there be no more vowels but one in a syllable?
R. No. In latin two vowels can never properly be joined together in one
syllable, except it be a dipthong.

Q. How many letters may be in a syllable?
R. So many as may be pronounced together with one breath without breaking of
the sound.

Q. How few letters may be in a syllable?
R. Sometime but one. But that must needs be a vowell. and then it is called,
a or e, or o, perse, that is a or e or o by it self, but if there be any
consonant in the syllable there must needs be more letters then one.

Q. How will ye know how many sillables there be in a word?
R. Very easily, for in latin there be so many sillables as there be vowels.
Except there be a Dipthong. But it is best known by the pronouncing of the
word.

Q. Why so?
R. For. So often as I am compelled to break the sound in pronouncing of a
word, so many sillables be in the word as in me, ri, di, e, i. I break
the sound five times, and therefore I have five sillables.

Q. Now. What call ye a word?
R. It is a voice consisting of one syllable or more, wherein is uttered so
much as signifies some what.

Q. How many sillables do make a word?
R. There is no certain number appointed. For some words be of one syllable
called Monosyllaba, some be of 2. called Dissillaba. Some of more then two,
called Hyperdissyllaba, Or of many syllables called Polysyllaba.

Q. Now what mean ye by distinctions of words?
R. They be certain pricks and marks which be used in writing, to divide
every sentence into his parts and to teach us how to pawse in reading.

Q. How many such marks have ye?
R. They be commonly these six.

1 Comma. 2 Colon. 3 Periodus. 4 Interrogatio. 5 Apostrophus. 6 Parenthesis.
Q. What is meant by Comma?
R. It is a little crook set at the end of a word, thus (,) which notes
that there is ended a little piece of a sentence, which we call a clawse, and
must have a very little pawse in reading.

Q. What mean ye by Colon?
R. It is a mark made with two pricks thus (:) and does note that there is
ended one of the chief parts of a sentence, called a member of a sentence,
and therefore requires a longer pawse.

Q. What call ye Periodus?
R. It is a mark made with one prick, thus (.) and notes that the sentence
is there fully ended. And therefore requires a perfect pawse.

Q. What mean ye by Interrogatio?
R. It is a mark made with two pricks thus (?) and notes that the sentence
going before it is a question, and should have the last words raised up
somewhat sharp in pronouncing.

Q. What call ye Apostrophus?
R. It is a little crook set at the top of a letter thus. Nost in'. And
notes that there is something lacking in the end of that word.

Q. What mean ye by Parenthesis?
R. That is a mark made with two half circles thus () and notes that all the
words betwixt these two half circles are no part of that sentence wherewith
they be joined, but are a special sentence of themselves, thrust into the
other sentence upon some special occasion: so that the other sentence may be
taken together whole without them.

Q. Now what things do ye observe in reading?
R. These two things.

1 Clean sounding. 2 Dew pawsing.
Q. Wherein stands clean sounding?
R. In giving to every letter his just and full sound. In breaking or dividing
every word duly into his several syllables, so that every syllable may be
heard by himself and none drowned, nor slubbered up ill fauouredly. In the
right pronouncing of ti, which of us is commonly sounded ci when any vowel
does follow next after him or else not. And finally in avoiding all such vices
as are of many foolishly used by evil custom.

Q. What vices be those?
R.

Iotacismus. sounding i too broad. 2 Labdacismus. sounding l too full. 3
Ischnotes. mincing of a letter, as feather for father. 4 Traulismus. stammering
or stutting. 5 Plateasmus, too much mouthing of letters. 6 Cheilostomia.
maffling or fumbling words in the mouth. 7 Abusing of letters. as v for f. vat
for fat. z for s as muza for musa. sh for ci. as fasho for facio dosham for
doceam foelishum for felicium and such like.
Q. Wherein stands due pawsing?
R. In right observation of the marks and pricks before mentioned.

And thus much for the first part of Grammar.
The second part of Grammar.
Q. Which is the second part of Grammar?
R. Etymologia.

Q. What mean ye by Etymologia?
R. It is a greek word, Which some interpret in latin Veriloquium. And (if
the word were used) in English, I would call it true woording. Or the true
use of words.

Q. What do you learn in Etymologia?
R. Three things.

1. The true original and beginning of words. 2. What every word is to be
called in Grammar. 3. What things fall or chance to every word.
Q. How will you learn the true original or beginning of words?
R. That must be learned by much reading after we know the rules of Grammar.

Q. Then what do ye learn in this part of Grammar for the calling of words?
R. There be many proper terms in Grammar which perteyne to words and
speech.

Q. Why, are words called otherwise in your art of Grammar then they be in
common speech?
R. Yea forsooth.

Q. Why so?
R. Because neither Grammar, nor any other art can be taught without some
special terms devised, to express the parts and things belonging to the
same.

Q. Show me some example?
R. As in the art of sailing there be many terms proper to that art. As of
the ship, the docke, the rudder, the snowte, the hatches, the deck, the mast,
etc. The plowman has proper terms in his own art, as of the plowe, the
beam, the cock, the tail, the cowlter, the share, etc. And so is it in all
other arts.

Q. Be all the terms of Grammar contained in Etymologia?
R. No. For every part of Grammar has his proper terms. As in Orthographia:
You had these terms, Letters, Dypthonges, Syllables, Distinctions, etc. So
are there special terms belonging to the other parts of Grammar.

Q. Then what terms of Grammar be in this second part called Etymologia?
R. Such terms as belong to the naming of words and things pertaining to
the same.

Q. What does Etymologia especially entreat of?
R. Of every word that is to be used in speech.

Q. What is speech?
R. It is a pronouncing of words together, wherein every man and woman
speaking to each other, use to utter their minds.

Q. Whereof is speech made?
R. Of words.

Q. Then what call ye words in Grammar?
R. I call all words parts of speech.

Q. How many parts of speech be there in Grammar?
R. Eight.

Q. Why, you said that every word is a part of speech and are there but
eight words in all the world?
R. Yes there be many thousands of words: But, all words that be used in
speech are called by one of these eight terms in Grammar.

Q. Which be those eight terms which ye call the eight parts of speech?
R These.

1 Nowne. 2 Pronowne. 3 Verb. 4 Participle. 5 Aduerbe. 6 Conjunction. 7
Preposition. 8 Interiection.
Q. Can there be no fewer then eight terms which do contain in them all
sorts of words?
R. Yes it were more easy to say there are but 4. a Nowne and a Verb, an
Aduerbe and a Conjunction.

Q. How so?
R. Because a Pronowne and a Participle may very well be referred to a Nowne,
and a Preposition and Interiection may well be referred to an Aduerbe.

Q. What is ye first difference amongst these 8. parts of speech?
R. Forsooth yt first 4. be declined: and yt latter 4. be undeclined.

Q. What mean ye by declined and undeclined.
R. That word in Grammar is said to be declined, which may be changed in
the last letter or syllable into other letters or syllables. And that which
cannot be so changed is said to be undeclined.

Q. Be those first four declined all in one manner?
R. No. For some of them be declined with cases, and some with moodes and
tenses.

Q. How many parts of speech be declined with cases?
R. These three. Nowne, Pronowne, and Participle. And a verb only is declined
with modes and tenses.

Q. What were the first difference among words if there were but four parts
of speech?
R. This. Some be words that have number in them, as a Nowne, and a verb.
Some be words yt have no number in them as an aduerbe and a conjunction.

Q. What is to be considered in every part of speech?
R. These 3. things. 1 what it is which is called the definition 2 what parts
it has which is called the division. 3 what things chance unto it which is
called the accide^ts.


Q. Then first what is a nowne?
R. Any word that betokens the name of any thing is a nowne. {Or thus. The
name of any thing that may be seen, felt, heard, or understood is a nowne.
As a book.

Q. Is thy book a nowne?
R. The thing it self which is called a book is not a nown, but this word
book, which is the name of the thing is a nowne, for a nowne signifies
nothing else but a name.

Q. Why do thou put this difference betwixt the thing and the name of the
thing?
R. For that in Grammar which teaches the true order of speech, we have to
consider nothing but the very words that be spoken: so that things which be
signified by these words perteyne nothing to Grammar, and therefore no kind
of thing is a nowne, but the word which is the name of any thing, that is a
nowne.

Q. How many sorts of nownes have ye?
R. Two, some be called

Substantives and Adjectives.
Q. How know you a nowne substantive?
R. A nowne substantive is a name that stands by himself.

Q. How can a nowne which is but a word stand by it self.
Q. I know that no word can properly stand by it self, but is a borrowed
speech and I mean an other thing by it.

Q. What mean ye by stands by him self?
R. That is to say, requires not an other word to be joined with him.

Q. Tell me this more plainly?
R. A nowne substantive is a perfect word, and a name so certain, that I
know certainly what thing it names, although there be no other word joined
with it.

So that when I say it stands by it self, I mean I can understand by it
self the thing that it signifies although there be no other word joined
unto it.

Q. Have ye any special mark whereby to know a nowne substantive?
R. Yea forsooth. Any word that may aptly and properly have before his
English this sign a. or the. is a nowne substantive, as A city, the city.

Q. How many sorts of nownes substantives have ye?
R. Two for some be called

Proper and Common or appellatiue.
Q. What call ye a nowne proper?
R. A proper name is a nowne which is proper to the thing that it betokens,
that is to say, which does signify some one special thing.

Q. How many sorts of proper names have ye?
R. Ten as proper names of

1 Godds. 2 Men. 3 Floodes. 4 Months. 5 Winds. 6 Goddesses. 7 Women. 8
Cities 9 Countries 10 Islands.
Q. What call ye a common name, or a nowne appellatiue.
R. A nown common is that whose signification is common to more, that is, which
betokens all things of that force.

Q. Show me examples of a proper name, and of a common name?
R. Edouardus is a proper name, and signifies but one man so called. But A man
is a common name and signifies all men. So Londinum the City of London is a
proper name: because it is the name but of one City so called. But vrbs a
City is a common name, because every City is called a City, but every city
is not called London.

Q. Now how know ye a nowne Adjective?
R. A nowne adjective is a name that cannot stand by him self.

Q. What mean ye by that?
R. That is to say, requires an other word to be joined with him.

Q. Tell me this more plainly?
R. A nowne adjective is the name of a thing, but so doubtful and uncertain,
as I know not certainly what thing it names except there be some other word
joined unto it: so that when I say it can not stand by it self: I mean that
I cannot perfectly understand what thing it belongs unto, except there be a
substantive joined unto it, as Good.

Q. Why, do ye not know that good is the name of a thing?
R. Yes, I know that when you say good you mean something, but I know not
what thing ye call good, except ye put some other word unto it: as a good
horse, a good boy.

Q. Have ye any special mark whereby to know a nowne adjective?
R. Yea forsooth In English, any name with which I may aptly join this word
thing, is a nowne adjective: as a good thing.

Q. This is enough for the division of a nowne. Now what mean ye by the
Accidents.
R. The Accidents be certain properties falling or belonging to all the parts
of speech generally, or to every several part of speech particularly, and
thereof my book is called an Accidence or the Accidents.

Q. Why so?
R. For that is (as I take it) the book that teaches all the accidents, that
is to say, all such things as fall or belong to all the parts of speech.

Q. How many sorts of accidents have ye?
R. Two sorts, for some be general and belong to all parts of speech as
form and figure. particular whereof some belong to 1 the four parts of
speech that be declined as number. 2 Three of those yt be declined as case,
gender and declenson to al nownes pronownes and participles. 3 Every several
part of speech as all the rest.



Q. How many accidents belong to a nowne.
R. 7. First the 2. general accidents. Form. Figure.

Secondly the general accidents of the four parts declined, which is Number.

Thirdly these four. Case. Gender. Declenson. Comparison.

Q. What call ye form?
R. Form is that Accident which in Latin is called species, whereby I discern
whether the word be sprung of it self and therefore called a primitive, or
whether it be drawn or derived out of an other word and so called a
deriuatiue, for all words be either the primitive or deriuatiue form.

Q. How many sorts of nownes have ye of the primitive form or that be called
primitiues?
R.

18 Substantives. 10.
1 Corporale. 2 Incorporale. 3 Absolutum. 4 Generale. 5 Speciale. 6 Homonymu^
or aequiuoc^. 7 Synonimum. 8 Collectiuum. 9 Ad aliquid. 10 Temporale.
Adjectives 8.
1 Interrogatiuum. 2 Infinitu^ or Indefinitu^. 3 Relatiuum. 4 Redditiuum. 5
Nume. Cardina. Ordinale. Distributi.
6 Partiti. 7 Vniuer. 8 Particu.
Nomina in
riu^ plus plex


Q. How many sorts of nownes have ye called deriuatiues*
R. 16. Whereof some be Substantives. 8.
1 Denominatiuum. 2 Contentiuum. 3 Ficticium. 5 Verbale. 5 Patrium. 6 Gentile.
7 Patronimi. 8 Diminitiuu^.
Adjectives. 8
1 Possessiuum. 2 Materiale. 3 Locale. 4 Participiale. 5 Gerundiuum. 6
Aduerbiale. 7 Comparatiuu^. 8 Superlatiuum.


But of verbals some be substantives some be adjectives, their terminations for
the most part be these.

Tus sus bundus io tor trix menxus bilis vra.

Q. What call ye figure?
R. Figure, called in Latin Figura is that accident whereby we discern
whether a word be altogether of him self, and that is said to be the simple
figure: or whether it be mingled with some other word, and such a word is
said to be either the compound figure, or the double compound figure.

Q. And are these 2. accidents common to all words?
R. Yea forsooth, for there is no word but that he is either

Primitive, or Deriuatiue. Simple or Compound.
Q. Now what call ye number?
R. Number is an accident whereby I discern whether ye speak of one thing or
of more.

Q. How many numbers have ye?
R. Two, the

Singular, with speaks of one as lapis a stone. Plural, with speaks of mo then
one as lapides stones.
Q. What call ye a case?
R. A case is every several ending of a nowne, pronowne and participle when it
is declined.

Q. What mean ye by declined?
R. Declined, that is to say altered, broken, or changed from the first name
of the word into other terminations.

Q. What mean you by terminations?
R. A termination is the end of a word, either in the last letters or in the
last syllables.

Q. How many cases have ye?
R. Six, the

Nominative. Genitive. Dative. Accusative. Vocative. Ablative.
Q. Has every nowne all these six cases, or several portions as ye call them?
R. Yea, if it be a perfect nowne.

Q. Why, have ye some nownes that be imperfect?
R. Yea, and those we call heteroclita, whereof be 3. sorts.

1 Variantia, which do vary somewhat from the common sort of nownes. 2
Deficientia, which do lack somewhat that commonly nownes have. 3
Redundantia, which have something more then commonly nownes have.
Q. What mean ye by the nominative case?
R. It might be called the name. It is so called a nominando, that is of
naming: for it is the very first name of every nowne, pronowne, and participle:
it is not properly a case, but is so termed only for plain teaching, it is
called in Latin rectus, and so is the vocative for the most part, and all the
other cases be called obliqui casus.

Q. What is the reason of these names?
R. Rectus casus signifies the right case, and the nominative case is so
called, because it sets down rightly the very name of every thing, as homo.
Obliquus casus, signifies a crooked or bended case, and so be all other cases
called, because their terminations are as it were bent and crooked away from
the nominative,

As hominis, homini, hominem, homine. etc.

Q. How know ye the nominative case?
R. The nominative case in the natural order of speech comes before the
verb, and if I join with the verb this qustion who or what, the word that
answers to that question is the nominative case.

As The Master teaches. Question Who teaches? Answer. The master.

Q. How know ye the genitive case?
R. The genitive is known in Latin by the terminations of the declensons, and
in English he has this sign of before him: and answers to the question
whose, of whom, or whereof, as. The learning of the Master.

Q. How know you the dative case?
R. In Latin by the termination, in English it has commonly this sign to,
before him, and answers to this question

To whom or To what? as I give a book to the Master.

Q. How know ye the Accusative case.
R. The Accusative case in order of speech follows the verb, and if ye
join the question whom or what with the verb, the word that answers the
question is the accusative case. As I love the Master.

Q. How know ye the vocative case?
R. In Latin by the termination: In English by calling or speaking to.

Q. For if I call or speak to any person, I must put the name of the person to
whom I speak in the vocative case, as Master, I love you.

Q. How know ye the ablative case?
R. In Latin by the termination of the declenson, and in English it has
commonly one of these signs before it.

In with through for from by or then.

Q. This is sufficient for the cases, what call ye Gender?
R. Gender is an accident of a nowne, whereby we make difference of natures in
the names of things considering whether the word signify the Male kind or
the Female.

Q. How many Genders have ye?
R. Mine accidence rehearses 7. but in deed there are but three.

Q. Which be those seven?
R. The

1 Masculine. 2 Feminine. 3 Newter. 4 Common of two. 5 Common of three. 6
Doutfull. 7 Epicaene.
Q. You say there are but 3. genders in deed, which be they?
R. The

Masculine. Feminine. Newter.
Q. What are the rest if they be not properly genders?
R. A mixture or mingling of genders.

Q. What mean yet by Masculine, Feminine, and Newter.
R. Masculine, betokens the male kind. Feminine, betokens the female
kind. Newter, signifies neither male nor female and under those 3. words are
all kind of natures comprehended.

Q. How is every gender discerned from other?
R. Every proper gender has his proper article.

Q. What call ye an Article?
R The mark whereby we discern the gender.

Q. How many articles have ye?
R. Three.

Hic. Haec. Hoc.
Q. Why, this Hic. Haec. Hoc, is a pronown and signifies this?
R. It is true. Hic. Haec. Hoc, is a Pronowne and then it signifies this, but
when it is declined with a Nowne, it is only an article, that is to say, the
mark of a gender and has no signification at all.

Q. Then which is the proper article of the Masculine gender?
R. The Masculine gender is declined with this article hic, as hic vir a man.

Q. Which is the article of the Feminine?
R. Haec.

Q. Which of the Newter?
R. Hoc.

Q. You say there are but three genders in deed: and they have their proper
articles. What then? Have those other which ye numbered among the genders, no
articles?
R. They be not properly genders, and therefore they have no proper articles,
But as they be a mixture or mingling of genders, so do they borrowe their
articles of the three proper genders.

Q. How so?
R. The common of two is both the masculine gender and the feminine, and
therefore he has both their articles hic and haec.

The common of three is both the masculine, the feminine, and the newter, and
therefore he borrows all their articles hic haec and hoc.

The doutfull gender is either the masculine or the feminine, and therefore he
has hic or haec.

Q. What article has the Epicene gender?
R. The Epicene gender may have any article according to the nature of the
word. But all nownes of the Epicene gender be either names of fowls or of
fishes, or of wild beasts. And because these nownes do in one word signify
two kinds, that is, the male and the female. Therefore we say such a word
is the Epicene gender, that is the common or mingled gender.

Q. Why so?
R. Because that in any such one word what article soever it has is
understood two natures, the male and the female As Vulpes the he fox and the
she. Passer the cock sparrow and yt hen. Halec the male hearing, and yt female.

Q. How will you find out the gender of a nowne?
R. By certain rules in latin verses set down in my book of the latin
Grammar.

Q. This is sufficient for ge^ders, what call ye declenson?
R. It is the breaking of the first name of a word into diverse other
terminations which we call cases.

Q. How many Declensons of nownes have ye?
R. Five.

Q. How will ye know what Declenson a nowne is?
R. By the termination or ending of the genitive case singular.

Q. How ends the genitive case singular of every declenson?
R.The genitive case singular of the first Declenson ends in ae second
Declenson ends in i third Declenson ends in is fourth Declenson ends in
us fifth. Declenson ends in ei

Q. What call ye this breaking of nownes into cases?
R. I call it declining of nownes.

Q. How ends the vocative case singular of the first declenson?
R. Like the nominative except nownes in as which do make their vocative in a
as Nominatiuo Thomas vocat. Thoma.

Q. How ends the Dative case plural of the first declenson?
R. in is.

Q. what, in all nownes?
R. No. For these two nownes filia and nata do make the dative and the
ablative case plural in is or in abus, As Datiuo his filiis vel siliabus. And
these four nownes Dea, Mola, Equa, Liberta do not make the dative and the
ablative case plural in is but only in abus, as Datiuo Deabus, Mulabus,
Equabus, Libertabus.

Q. How ends the vocative case singular in the 2. declenson?
R. For the most part like the nominative?

Q. Does it not always end like the nominative?
R. No forsooth.

Q. When does it not end like the nominative?
R. When the nominative ends either in us or in ius.

Q. How ends the vocative when the nominative ends in us?
R. When the nominative ends in us the vocative shall end in e.

Q. What in all nownes?
R. Yea forsooth. Except this word Deus which makes the vocative case Deus
also. And filius which makes the vocative fili.

Q. How ends the vocative when yt nominative ends in ius?
R. When the nominative ends in ius the vocative shall end in i if the word
be a proper name of a man, as Terentius vocat. Terenti: otherwise it ends in
e.

Q. You said that all Nownes which have their nominative in us, do make their
vocative in e except Deus and filius. How say ye to Manus, does he make his
vocative case Mane?
R. No. For manus is a nowne of the 4. declenson. And this rule is only for
nownes of the second declenson.

Q. Do all other nownes in us of the second declenson except Deus, make their
vocative in e.
R. Nay. These 6. nownes, agnus, lucus, vulgus, populus, chorus, fluuius, make
their vocative in e or in us.

Q. How ends the vocative case in all other declensons?
R. The vocative case in all declensons generally ends like the nominative
both in the singular number and in ye plural.

Q. Hoc regnum, tegni, what declenson is it?
R. The second because the genitive case singular ends in i.

Q. What is his nominative case plural?
R. Regna.

Q. Why, how ends the nominative case plural of the second declenson?
R. in i.

Q. Then why do ye not say nominative haec regni?
R. Because it is a nowne of the newter gender.

Q. And what then?
R. All nownes of the newter gender of what declenson soever, have the
nominative, the accusative and the vocative alike both in the singular number
and in the plural. And those three cases in the plural number end always in
a as well in substantives, as in adjectives of the newter gender.

Q. Is there no nowne substantive nor adjective of the newter gender but that
he makes the nominative the accusative and the vocative case plural in a?
R. None except these two nownes ambo and duo. And they do not make these
three cases plural in a. but in o, and therefore I say pluraliter ambo ambae
ambo, and not amba.

Of Adjectives.
Q. This is sufficient for substantives. Now how many sorts of adjectives
have ye?
R. So many as I had of substantives. For some be proper, some be common. And
some be Primitive some be Deriuatiue. And some be simple and some be compound.

Q. What accidents has an adjective?
R. All those which a substantive has and one more.

Q. Which is that?
R. Comparison.

Q. Why does not a sudstantiue make comparison?
R. No forsooth. For comparison is only proper to adjectives, although in
some Authors are read some few words of the co^paratiue degree drawn out of
substantives, yet it is improper. For no substantive does properly form
comparison but by abuse.

Q. Are all the accidents in an adjective as they be in a substantive?
R. Form, Figure, Number, and case be the same and in the same manner in an
adjective, that they were in a substantive: but there is some difference in the
genders and in the declyning.

Q. What genders has an adjective?
R. Every perfect adjective has in every case both in the singular number and
in the plural all the three proper genders: That is to say, the Masculine, the
Feminine and yt Newter.

Q. How will ye find out these three genders in every case of an adjective?
R. If there be three terminations of the adjective as bonus, bona, bonum, the
first termination is the Masculine gender, the second is the feminine, and the
third is the newter. If there be but two terminations as hunc and hanc
foelicem and hoc foelix, then the former termination as foelicem is both the
Masculine and the Feminine, and the latter termination as foelix is the Newter.
If there be but one termination, as hic haec and hoc foelix or Datiuo bonis,
then that one termination is both the Masculine, the Feminine, and the Newter
in what case soever it be.

Q. How chance ye said there were but two terminations, when ye reckoned
hunc and hanc foelicem and hoc foelix, are there no words but two?
R. Yes, but because hunc hanc and hoc are but articles, that is to say, signs
of the gender, therefore I must not reckon them nor any one of the articles in
what case soever it be, for any part or termination of the Nowne, so that
beside the articles there are no more terminations in that case but foelicem and
foelix.

Q. What difference is there in declining of adjectives?
R. Forsooth some be declined with three terminations in every case without any
articles: and some be declined with three articles.

Q. How be nownes adjectives of 3. terminations declined?
R. Nownes adjectives of 3. terminations in the masculine gender, be declined
like nownes substantives of the Masculine gender in the second declenson, that
is to say, like Dominus or Magister. In the Feminine gender like a nowne of the
first declenson as Musa. In the newter, like a nowne of the Newter gender in
the second Declenson, as Regnum.

Q. How be nownes adjectives of 3. articles declined?
R. Like nownes substantives of the Masculine, Feminine, and newter gender in
the 3. declenson.

Q. Be all adjectives declined in this manner?
R. All saving these eight, vnus, totus, solus, vllus, alius, alter, vter and
neuter. And their compoundes which make their genitive case singular in ius
and their dative in i, in all other cases they are declined like nownes
adjectives of three terminations.

Of Comparison.
Q. We have past over six of the accidents of a Nowne, which is the seventh?
R. Comparison.

Q. What call ye comparison?
R. It is in english the altering of the signification of a word by degrees
into more or less, In latin it is the altering of a word into other
terminations, whereby the word does signify more or less.

Q. How many parts of speech do form comparison?
R. These four, a

Nowne. Participle. Aduerbe. Preposition.
Q. Are ye sure that all these four parts of speech dot make comparison?
R. I cannot say that they all properly do form comparison, so long as they
be taken for those parts of speech.

Q. Why so?
R. For a Participle when he forms comparison is accounted to be a nowne
adjective. And a Preposition when he forms comparison is counted an Aduerbe.

Q. Well then, do all nownes adjectives and all Aduerbes form comparison?
R. No forsooth.

Q. Which then?
R All such nownes and aduerbes whose signification may be increased or
diminished, That is to say, made more or made less, as hard, harder, hardest.

Q. How many sorts of comparison have ye?
R. These four a comparison that is called 1 perfect. 2 anomala. without rule
3 defectiua. lacking. 4 abusiua. not in use.


Q. Which call ye a perfect comparison?
R. That which has all the degrees of comparison and is formed after some
certain rule.

Q. What mean ye by a degree of comparison.
R. Every word in the adjective or aduerbe that alters the signification by
more or less is called a degree.

Q. How many degrees of comparison be there?
R. Three. The

Positive. Comparatiue. Superlatiue.
Q. What mean ye by the Positive?
R. The Positive degree is yt very first word of ye adjective or Aduerbe that
forms comparison, as durus hard.

Q. Why, here is no signification increased by more or less?
R. It is true. For the positive does signify a thing absolutely without
excess, that is to say it has no respect of comparison with any other word,
neither does it increase his signification by more or less, and therefore it
is improperly called a degree of comparison.

Q. What call ye the comparatiue degree?
R. That which signifies somewhat more then the positive, as durior harder.

Q. What call ye the Superlatiue degree?
R. That which exceeds the positive in the highest degree, that is, which
signifies more then his positive in all respects. As Durissimus, hardest of
all.

Q. And how many rules have ye to form these degrees?
R. I have only one rule to form the comparatiue degree: And three to form
the superlatiue.

Q. How form ye the positive?
R. The positive is not formed at all: But is the very first word of the
adjective or aduerbe out of which the comparitiue and superlatiue degree is
formed.

Q. Which is the rule to form the comparatiue degree?
R. This, The comparatiue degree is formed of the first case of his positive
that ends in i by putting to or, or us, as Durus hard, the genitive case is
Duri, put to or and it makes Durior, put to us and it makes Durius, and so
the comparatiue degree of Durus, is hic and haec durior and hoc durius.

Q. Which is your first rule for the superlatiue degree?
R. This. The superlatiue degree is formed of the first case of his positive
that ends in i. by putting thereto s. and simus. As Durus the genitive case
is Duri, put to s. and it makes Duris, and then put to simus and it makes
Durissimus, and that is the superlatiue degree.

Q. Is the genitive always the first case in i?
R. Yea forsooth, in adjectives of three terminations, but in adjectives of
three articles, the dative is the first case in i.

Q. What is your second rule to form the superlatiue degree?
R. This. If the positive do end in er, then the superlatiue degree is not
formed of the first case of his positive that ends in i, but of the
nominative case of the positive that ends in er, by putting thereto rimus. As
to Nominatiuo pulcher, I put rimus, and so the superlatiue degree is
pulcherrimus.

Q. What is your third rule to form the superlatiue degree.
R. The third rule is for these six adjectives that end in lis, humilis,
similis, facilis, agilis, gracilis, docilis.

Q. Is it not for all adjectives that end in lis as well as for these six?
R. No. For all other adjectives in lis except these six do form their
superlatiue degree according to the first rule, as vtilis makes vtilissimus.

Q. But how do these six form the superlatiue degree?
R. Of the nominative case in lis, by changing is into limus, as humilis
change is into limus and there is the superlatiue degree humillimus.

Q. Be here all the rules for perfect comparisons?
R. No forsooth, there be certain nownes compounded of these verbes dico,
volo, and facio, which are also referred to the perfect comparison.

Q. How do nownes that be made of dico, volo, and facio make comparison?
R. They make the comparatiue degree by changing us into entior, and the
superlatiue by changing us into entissimus. As maledicus, maledicentior,
maledicentissimus.

Q. Be there any more rules to form comparisons?
R. Some call it a comparison which is made by these aduerbs magis and maxim.

Q. What nownes make comparison by magis and maxim?
R. Nownes that end in us, and have a vowell going before us, as pius.

Q. And how do they make comparison?
R. For the comparatiue degree we put magis to the positive: and for the
superlatiue we put maxim to the positive.

Q. Show me how?
R. Pius, is Latin for godly and this is the positive degree, and for the
comparatiue degree I say magis pius more Godly, and for the superlatiue I say
maxim pius most Godly. So in this word assiduus for continual the
comparatiue is magis assiduus, the superlatiue is maxim assiduus.

Q. This is sufficient for the perfect comparisons, now what call you a
comparison anomala or without rule.
R. That comparison I call anomala or without rule, which although it has all
the degrees of comparison, yet it is formed after no certain rule, as bonus,
melior, optimus.

Q. Is not this formed after a rule?
R. No, For I have no rule to form melior or optimus out of bonus, for
according to my rule I should say bonus, bonior bonissimus.

Q. What adjectives be of this sort of comparison?
R. These adjectives, aduerves, and prepositions.

Adjectives. Vetus. Veterior. Veterrimus. Maturus. Maturior. Maturimus Bonus.
Melior. Optimus.
Malus. Peior. Pessimus.
Magnus. Mayor. Maximus.
Paruus. Minor Minimus.
Multum. plus. Plurimu^.


Praepositiones. Citra. Citerior. Citimus. Intra. Interior. Intimus Infra.
Inferior. Infimus, vel Imus.
Extra. Exterior. Extimus vel Extremus.
Supra. Superior. Supremus vel Summus.
Post. Posterior. Postremus.
Vltra. Vlterior. Vltimus.
Prope. Propior. Proxime.


Aduerbes. Pridem. Prior. Primus.
Diu. Diutior. Diutissimus.
Saepe. Saepius. Saepissime.
Paenitus. Paenitior. Paenitissimus.


Q. Which call ye the defective or lacking comparison?
R. That which lacks some of the degrees of comparison, as Multus, Plurimus,
multa, Plurima. Here I have ye Positive and the Superlatiue, but here lacks
the comparatiue. For Multus has not the comparatiue degree, but in the newter
Gender.

Q. What other words have ye that lack some degrees of comparison.
R. These want the positive.

Ocyor. Ocissimus Potior. Potissimus. Habitior. Habitissimus.


These want the comparatiue. Inclytus. Inclytissimus. meritus. meritissimus.
multus. plurimus. multa. plurima. paene. paenissimus. nuper. nuperrimus.
apricus. apricissimus. falsus. falsissimus. nouus. nouissimus. diuersus.
diuersissimus.


These want the superlatiue. Opimus. Opimior. adolescens. adolescentior.
iuuenis. junior. senex. senior. Maximusnatu. sinister. sinisterior. ante.
anterior. longinquus. longinquior. dives. Diuitior. infinitus. infinitior.
barbarus. barbarior. Decliuus. decliuior.


Q. Which call ye the comparison abusiua, or not in use?
R. That which although Poets and old writers have used, yet it is improper and
of us not to be used.

Q. Rehearse some such words?
R. Ipsissimus. of Ipse. Tuissimus. of Tu. Assiduior. Assiduissimus. of
Assiduus. Proximior. of Proximus. Strenuior. of Strenuus. Egregiissimus. of
Egregius. Pientissimus piissimus. of Pius. Multissimus. of Multus.
Perpetuissimus. of Perpetuus. Mirificissimus. of Mirificus. Neronior. of Nero.

Substantives. Cinaedior. of Cinaedus. Punior. of Paenus.

Of the Pronowne.
Q. Which is the second part of speech?
R. A Pronowne.

Q. What is to be considered in a Pronowne?
R. 3. things, his Definition. that is to tell what it is. Division. that is to
tell what parts or sorts it has. Accident. that is to tell what things
chance or belong to it.

Q. What is a Pronowne?
R. A Pronowne is a part of speech much like to a Nowne, put in stead of a
Nowne, and serves for a Nowne.

Q. Is not a Pronowne the same that a Nowne is?
R. Some good writers make them all one: But according to the accustomed
manner, we make them diverse.

Q. For what cause are Pronownes used?
R. For two causes, namely for showing some thing or person, which we list not
to name, as this man, or else for rehearsing some thing or person that has been
before spoken of. As that man.

Q. How many sorts of pronownes have ye?
R. Two

Substantives and Adjectives.
Q. How many pronownes are Substantives, and how many Adjectives?
R. These three, ego, tu, sui, be substantives, and the other be adjectives.

Q. How many pronownes have ye in all?
R. Fifteen, ego, tu, sui, ille, ipse, iste, hic, is, meus, tuus, suus,
noster, vester, nostras, vestras.

Q. Be there no more but fifteen pronownes?
R. Yes there be more, as egomet, tute, idem, isthic, hiccine, etc. but these
be compoundes: so that I have no more but fifteen simple pronownes.

Q. Yes ye have the relative qui amongst them, and qui is no compounde,
therefore there be more then fifteen simple pronownes?
R. The relative qui in deed is put amongst the pronownes, but there is a dout
amongst the Gra^marians of qui, for some say it is a nowne, and some say it is
a pronowne.

Q. This is sufficient for the definition and the division of pronownes, Now
tell me what accidents has a pronowne?
R. First the two general accidents.

Form and Figure.
Q. What call ye form?
R. The accident whereby we discern which be primitiues and which be
deriuatiues.

Q. How many be primitiues?
R. These eight, ego, tu, sui, ille, ipse, iste, hic and is.

Q. How many be deriuatiues?
R. These seven, meus, tuus, suus, noster and vester.

Q. Why be they called primitiues?
R. Because they spring of them selves.

Q. Why be they called deriuatiues?
R. Because they be derived or drawn out of the primitiues.

Q. Out of what primitiues be your 7. deriuatiues drawn?
R. Out of mei, cui, sui, nostri and vestri, which are the genitive cases of
ego, tu, sui, nos, and vos.

Q. How many sorts of primitiues have ye?
R. Two, for some be called

Demonstratiues, such are all those eight primitiues, ego, tu, sui, etc.
Relatiues, as ille, iste, hic and is.
Q. Why be they called Demonstratiues?
R. Because they show a thing not spoken of before.

Q. Why be they called Relatiues?
R. Because they rehearse something yt was spoken of before.

Q. How many sorts of Deriuatiues have ye?
R. Two also, for some be called

Possessiues, as meus, tuus, suus, noster and vester. Gentiles, as nostras,
vestras.
Q. What mean ye by possessiues?
R. They be so called, because they betoken owing or possession, as meus mine,
tuus thine, etc.

Q. Why be they called Gentiles?
R. They be so called of Gens a country or nation, because they properly
betoke^ pertaining to countries or nations, to sects or factions, as Nostras
signifies of our country or sect or faction, and so vestras of your country
etc.

Q. This is for the form, what mean ye by figure?
R. It is the general accident, whereby is considered, whether the word be
simple or compounde.

Q. How many pronownes be simple?
R. All those fifteen before rehearsed.

Q. How many sorts of compounde Pronownes have ye?
R. Five sorts. For, Nownes, as Cuiusmodi. Pronownes, as Isthic, Egomet.
Aduerbes, as Idem of Is and Demum, Eccum, of Ecce hic Illum. Some be compounded
with Prepositions, as mecum, tecum, secum. these sillables, ce as hicce cine as
hiccine. met, as egomet, te, as tute, pte, as meapte.

Q. This is sufficient for the general accidents. What special accidents
has a Pronowne?
R. All and the same that a nowne has saving one. Namely,

Number. Case. Gender. Declenson, and Person.
Q. And are these in the same manner in a Pronowne, as they are in a Nowne?
R. Number, case, and Gender, are ye same in a Pronowne, that they be in a
nowne. But ye declensons do somewhat differ.

Q. How many declensons of Pronownes have ye?
R. Four.

Q. What Pronownes are of the first Declenson?
R. The three substantives, Ego, Tu, Sui, be of the first Declenson and have
the genitive case in i.

Q. What Pronownes be of the second Declenson?
R. These five ille, ipse, iste, hic and is, be of the second decle^son and
have the genitive case in ius and the Dative in i.

Q. Your Accidence rehearses six?
R. It is true, for the Relative qui is numbered amongst them, because he is
declined much like unto them, but as I said before, it is doubted whether he be
a nowne or a Pronowne.

Q. What Pronownes be of the third Declenson?
R. The five Possessiues, and be declined like nownes adjectives of three
terminations. Saving that meus in the Masculine gender of the vocative case
singular makes not me but mi and tuus, suus, and vester do lack the
vocative case.

Q. What Pronownes be of the fourth declenson?
R. The two Gentiles Nostras and Vestras, and they be declined altogether like
nownes adjectives of 3. articles.

Q. Your Accidence rehearses 3.
R. It is true, for Cuias is joined with them, because he is called a Gentile
and declined as they be. But Cuias is a mere Nowne, and no Pronowne.

Q. This is sufficient for Declensons. But does not a Pronowne form comparison?
R. No not properly.

Q. Why, Ipse and tu be Pronownes, and they form comparison, as Ipse
ipsissimus, Tu Tuissimus. Ergo a Pronowne also forms comparison?
R. Indeed these words are to be found in some writers: But this comparison
in Pronownes is improper and out of use, although suffered sometimes in the
Poets.

Q. Well then, the last accident of a Pronowne is person, what call ye person?
R. Person is the name of any thing or creature which is said to do or
suffer any thing, as well in things that have no life as in living creatures.

Q. Does not person also chance to a Nowne?
R. No not properly.

Q. Why, the name of every thing is a nowne, and you say that the name of
every thing is a person, and therefore every Nowne is a person.
R. It is true, every Nowne substantive and every Pronowne substantive, and
whatsoever supplieth the place of a substantive in Grammar is a person.

Q. Why do ye not say then that person belongs as well to a Nowne as to a
Pronowne?
R. Because there is no such special difference of persons in nownes as there
is in Pronownes. For every nowne is of the third person.

Q. How many persons be there?
R. Three.

Q. How know ye the first person?
R. The first person is a word that speaks of himself, as I, We: And has
no more words in Latin of the first person properly, but Ego and Nos.

Q. How know ye the second person?
R. The second person betokens somewhat that is spoken to, as Thou, Ye: And
has no more words of yt person properly in Latin, but Tu, and Vos, and every
vocative case.

Q. How know ye the third person?
R. The third person betokens somewhat that is spoken of, as He, They: And
so all nownes Pronownes and Participles are of the third Person except Ego,
Nos, Tu and Vos, and every vocative case.

Q. To what use serve these persons in speech?
R. They be always referred to some verb, and I can form no verb in any
mood or tense, except the Infinitive, but I must always have with it one of
these persons.

Q. Why so?
R. For these persons in Pronownes be like to articles in nownes. For as I
join some of them with the nowne in declining it. So I join some of these
persons with the verb in forming it.

Q. Which be the persons yt ye use in forming of verbes?
R. These.

Singular. 1 Ego. I. plural. 1 Nos. We. 2 Tu. thou. 2 Vos. Ye. 3 Ille. he. 3
Illi. They.

Of a Verb.
Q. Which is the third part of speech?
R. A verb.

Q. What is to be considered in a verb?
R. Three things, His

Definition. Division. Accidents.
Q. What is a verb?
R. A word that signifies any thing, which any thing or creature may be, may
do, or cause to be done, is a verb. Or thus. A verb is a part of speech that
betokens, doing, suffering, or being: And is always formed with mode and
tense.

Q. To what use serves a verb in speech?
R. To make the speech perfect. For there can be no speech without a verb.

Q. Why so?
R. For as in a Nowne be comprehended all words that signify the name of any
creature that may do, may suffer, or may be any thing. So a verb
comprehends al words that signify the doing, suffering or being of any
such creature.

Q. How many sorts of verbes have ye?
R. Two. That is to say.

Personal, and Impersonall.
Q. What call ye Personal?
R. That which is formed with Persons.

Q. What call ye Impersonall?
R. That which is formed in yt third person singular throughout all modes and
tenses without any persons: And have commonly before them in English this sign
it or there.

Q. How many sorts of verbes Impersonals have ye?
R. Two.

One of the Active voice ending in t. Another of the Passive voice ending in
tu^.
Q. How many kinds of verbes Personals have ye?
R. Of verbes personals there be five kinds.

Active. Passive. Newter. Deponent. Common.
Q. How shall I know of what kind my verb is?
R. By his

Voice. Termination. Declining.
Q. What mean ye by voice?
R. I call voice the signification of the verb.

Q. How many sorts of voices be there in verbes?
R. Three.

Active. Passive. Newter.
But we will make no difference between Active and Newter.

Q. What mean ye by Active voice?
R. Active signifies doing. And so a verb of the Active voice is a word that
signifies to do somewhat.

Q. How will ye know which verb is the Active voice?
R. Any verb is the Active voice, which has not before his english any sign
of a Passive?

Q. How will ye know which verb is the Passive voice?
R. Any verb is the Passive voice which has before his english any of these
signs of the Passive.

Q. Which be the signs of the Passive?
R. These: am, are, art, is, was, were, were, be, or been.

Q. Which kind of verbes have the Active voice, and which have the Passive?
R. A verb Actiue-hath always the Active voice: A verb passive has always
the Passive voice. Some verbes newters have the Active voice and some have the
Passive. A verb Deponent has always the Active voice, and a verb Common
has both the Active and the Passive voice.

Q. What mean ye by termination in verbes?
R. I mean the latter end of the verb in the last letter.

Q. How many terminations have ye in verbes?
R. Three. For some verbes end in

o. or. m.
Q. How many sorts of verbes end in o?
R. Two. A verb Active and a verb Newter.

Q. How many kinds of verbes end in or?
R Three. A verb Passive, a verb Deponent, and a verb Common.

Q. How many kinds of verbes end in M?
R. A few verbes Newters, as

Sum. Forem.
and their Compoundes.

Q. Now what mean ye by declining of verbes?
R. I mean the rehearsing of the first and second person, of the
preterperfectense, of the infinitive mode, of ye gerundes and supines, and of
the participles.

Q. And how many sorts of declynings be there in verbs?
R. Generally two. For all verbes for the most part be declined either like ye
verb Active, or like the verb Passive.

Q. How know ye a verb Active?
R. A verb Active ends in o, has the Active voice and by putting to this
letter r, may be made a Passive.

Q. How is he declined?
R. Thus. His first word ends in o, as Amo, Doceo, Lego, Audio. His second
word ends in as, es, or is, as amas, doces, legis, audis. The third word in
declining of verbes is ye preterperfectense and ends in i as amaui, docui,
legi, audiui. His 4. word in declining is the Infinitive mode, and ends in
re, as amare, docere, legere, audire. Then follows 3. gerundes ending in di,
do, and dum, as amandi, amando, amandum, docendi, docendo, docendum, legendi,
legendo, legendum, audiendi, audiendo, audiendum. Then two Supines, the first
ending in um and the other in u, as amatum, amatu, doctu^, doctu, lectum,
lectu, auditum, auditu. Then a Participle of the Presentense in ans or ens, as
amans, docens, legens, audiens. Lastly, a Participle of the first Future tense
in rus, as amaturus, docturus, lecturus, auditurus.

Q. How know ye a verb Passive?
R. A verb passive ends in or, has always the Passive voice, and by
putting away the letter r he may be made an Active.

Q. How is he declined?
R. Thus: his first word ends in or, as amor, doceor, legor, audior: his
second word ends in ris or re, as amaris vel amare, doceris vel docere,
legeris vel legere, audiris or audire: the third word in declining is always
the Preterperfectense and is made of the Participle of the Pretertense and the
verb Sum, es, fui, as Amatus sum vel fui, Doctus sum vel fui, Lectus sum vel
fui, auditus sum vel fui: the fourth word in declining is the Infinitive mode
and ends in i, as amari, doceri, legi, audiri: Then follows a Participle of
the Pretertense, as amatus, doctus, lectus, auditus: and lastly, a Participle
of the latter Future tense, as amandus, docendus, legendus, audiendus.

Q. How know ye a verb Newter?
R. He ends always in o, or m, and has for the most part the Active
signification. But some verbes Newters have the Passive voice, and he cannot
take r to him and become a Passive.

Q. How is he declined?
R. Altogether like a verb Active, saving that some verbs newters have their
Preterperfectense like the verb Passive and such be called Newter Passiues.

Q. How many sorts of verbes Newters have ye?
R. Three, for some be called

Substantives. Absolute, or Intransitiue. Transitiue.
Q. Which call ye a verb Substantive?
R. Such a verb as only signifies being, as Sum, forem, fio, and existo.

Q. What mean ye by Absolute or Intransitiue?
R. Such a verb as has an absolute or perfect sense in his own signification
without any word joined after him, as aegroto I am sick: curro, I run.

Q. What mean ye by a verb Transitiue?
R. Such a verb as has not a perfect sense in his own signification, but
must be made up by some word coming after him, as viuo vitam, I live a life,
and of this sort are Actiues and Deponentes: as amo magistrum, I love the
master, loquor verbum, I speak a word.

Q. How know ye a verb Deponent?
R. A verb Deponent ends in or like a Passive, but he has the Active
voice, and cannot put away the letter r, and so become an Active.

Q. How is a verb Deponent declined
R. Altogether like a verb Passive till after the Infinitive mode, and then
with Gerundes and Supines like a verb Active, saving that he must have three
Participles one of the Presentense, one of the Pretertense, and one of the
future in rus.

Q. How know ye a verb Common?
R. He ends always in or, and has both the Active and the Passive voice*
but he cannot put away r, and become an Active.

R. There be in deed but three, but we divide them into five.

Q. Which be those three tenses?
R. The time present. wc we call the present tense. past. wc we call the preter

R. Person in verbes, is every several changing of the verb in every tense
into other terminations, and is much like that which we call case in a nowne.

Q. How many such persons have ye in verbes?
R. I have in every tense of any mode (except the Infinitive and the
Imperative) three persons in the singular number and three in the plural, if
the verb be perfect.

Q. Why do ye except the Infinitive mode?
R. Because the Infinitive mode has neither number nor person nor nominative
case before him.

Q. Why do ye except the Imperative mode?
R. Because the Imperative mode lacks the first person singular.

Q. What difference is betwixt the persons in verbes and the persons in a
nowne, and in a pronowne?
R. Those persons of a nowne and of a pronowne, do note who or what it is that
does or suffers any thing: These persons in a verb do note what it is that
is done or suffered.

Q. Rehearse the persons of the pronowne?
R. Singulariter. Ego. I Tu. thou. Ille. he.


Pluraliter. Nos. we. Vos. ye. Illi. they.

Pluraliter.
Nos amamus 1 we love. Vos amatis 2 ye love. Illi amant. 3 they love


Q. Do ye always in forming the tenses of your verbes, join one of these
persons of the pronowne.
R. No forsooth, I do not always express the person of the pronowne with the
person of the verb, but wheresoever I have any person of a verb, I must
always understand one of these persons of the pronowne with it.

Q. This is sufficient for the persons, what call you coniugations?
R. It is the breaking of the first name of a verb into diverse other
terminatio^s called persons: As a declenson is yt breaking of the first name of
a nowne into diverse other terminations called cases.

Q. How many sorts of Coniugations be there in verbes?
R. 4. Namely, The conjugation which is called. 1 Perfecta that is to say,
perfect. 2 Anomala out of rule. 3 Defectiua lacking. 4 Abusiua out of use.


Q. Which call ye the perfect conjugation?
R. That which has all modes, tenses, numbers and persons that ought to be in
a verb, and is formed after one of those 4. examples which I have in mine
Accidence.

Q. How many sorts of perfect coniugations have ye?
R. Four.

Q. How will you know what conjugation your verb is?
R. If it end in o: by the vowell that goes next before re in the Infinitive
mode: but if it end in or, by the vowell that goes next before ris in the
second person singular of the Indicative mode, and this vowell is called the
latter index.

Q. How shall I find out the Infinitive mood?
R. It is always the fourth word in declining a verb.

Q. How shall I find out the second person?
R. It is always the second word in declining the verb.

Q. How many tenses be in every mode?
R. Every mode has all the five tenses except the Imperative mode, which has
no more but the present tense, and as some say the future tense.

Q. How know you a verb of any conjugation?
R.The first. conjugation has a long before re and ris. The second.
conjugation has e long before re and ris. third conjugation has e short
before re and ris. fourth conjugation has i long before re and ris.

Q. Which call ye the Conjugation anomala or without rule?
R. That which although it has all modes, tenses, numbers and persons that
ought to be in a verb, yet it is not formed after any of the examples of the 4
per fect coniugations.

Q. How many coniugations have ye of those that be called anomala or without
rule.
R. So many as there be verbes without rule, for every one of them has a
conjugation proper to himself, and must be learned by use without rule.

Q. How many such verbes have ye?
R. These are ye most common

Sum. Possum. Volo. Nolo. Malo. Edo. fio. fero. feror, and eo and queo be in
some tenses. anomala.
Q. How be eo and queo anomala?
R. For eo makes Ibam, and queo makes quibam in the preterimperfect tense of
the Indicative mode, and eo makes ibo and queo makes quibo in the future tense
of the Indicative mode, but in all other modes and tenses, they be formed like
verbes in o of the fourth conjugation, saving that they make their gerundes
eundi, eundo, eundum, queundi, queundo, queundum.

Q. Which is the conjugation that you call defectiua or lacking.
R. That which lacks some modes, tenses, numbers and persons.

Q. How many coniugations have ye of verbes called defectiua?
R. So many as there be verbes Defectiues.

Q. Which be those?
R. These be the most common, aio, ausim, salve, aue, vale, cedo, faxo, forem,
quaeso, insit, inquio vel inquam, and these four, odi, caepi, memini, and
noui, be in some tenses defectiues.

Q. What tenses do these four verbes odi, caepi memini and noui lack?
R. They lack all present tenses and preterimperfect tenses, the future tense
of the indicative and of the infinitive mode.

Q. What tenses have odi, caepi, memini, and noui?
R. They have no more tenses then the preterperfect tense of the indicative
mode and such tenses as be formed of the preterperfect tence of the Indicative
mode.

Q. What tenses be formed of the preterperfect tense of the Indicative mode.
R. Of the preterperfect tense of the indicative mode be formed
preterpluperfect tense of ye indicative mode preterperfect tense of the
optatiue mode preterpluperfect tense of the pote^tial and mode future tense of
the subiu^ctiue mode preterperfect tense of ye infinitive mode preterpluperfect
tense of ye infinitive mode


Q. Tell me how?
R. The preterpluper. tense of ye indicat. is formed by changing ye last vowel
of ye preterper. into e and putting to ram preterperfect optatiue potent. rim
future subiunc. to. The preterpluperfect of the optat. potent. subiunct. is
formed by keeping still s and sem. preterperfect. of the infinite. of the last
vowell of ye preterper. which is i and putting to s and se preterpluper.

Q. What is the conjugation of verbes called Abusiua?
R. That neither is formed according to the order of the four coniugations,
neither is in use among writers, but was abused by old Poets for the verse
sake. As perduint for perdant?

Q. What call ye forming of verbes?
R. It is like that which I call declining of nownes, for it is the breaking of
the first name of the verb into his several modes, and every mode into his
several tenses, and every tense into his several persons.

Q. How is a verb formed?
R. It is better learned by use and example then by rule, and therefore I have
in my Accidence, for every one of the four perfect coniugations a several
example as well for the verb in o as for the verb in or, according to the
which I must form all other perfect verbes.

Q. Which be the examples of your 4. perfect coniugations?
R. The example of the first conjugation, is Amo and his passive Amor. The
example of the second conjugation, is Doceo and his passive Deceor. The example
of the third conjugation, is Lego and his passive Legor. The example of the
fourth conjugation, is Audio and his passive Audior.

Q. May any verb be formed according to one of these four examples?
R. Yea any perfect verb, saving that there is some difference in the preter
perfect tense, and supines.

Q. How shall I find them out?
R. We have certain rules for them in Latin verses, whereof we shall speak
more by them selves.

Q. How shall ye form your verbes that be called Anomola, defectiua, and
abusiua.
R. Every one of them must be learned with use severally by them selves,
because we have neither rules nor examples for them.

Q. How be verbes Impersonalls formed?
R. In the third person singular only throughout all modes and tenses, as well
in the Active voice as in the Passive.

Q. Which call ye Gerundes?
R. They be certain voices in verbes belonging to the Infinitive mode ending
in di, do, and dum, as amandi, amando, amandum.

Q. Why be they called Gerundes?
R. Some say a gerendo morem: Because they serve both for nownes and for verbes.

Q. How so?
R. They serve verbes for that they have the signification of verbes both
Active and Passive: they serve nownes because they have the form of nownes,
and of some be declined like nownes.

Q. How be Gerundes declined like nownes?
R. Nominat, caret. Genitiuo Amandi, of loving, or of being loved. Datiuo
caret. Accusatiuo Amandum, to love or to be loved. Vocatiuo caret. Ablatiuo
Amando in loving, or in being loved.

Q. What mean ye by Supines?
R. The Supines be also two several voices perteyning to verbes, whereof the
first ends in um, and is englished like the Infinitive mode Active as amatum,
to love, and the latter ends in u, and is englished like the Infinitive mode
Passive, as amaru, to be loved.

Linacer thinks that both these should be called participiall verbes,
because they take part with a verb as signification, and part with a nowne as
case and Declenson.

Of a Participle.
Q. Which is the fourth part of speech?
R. A Participle.

Q. What is to be considered in a Participle?
R. Three things, his

Definition, That is to tell What it is? Division. What parts or kinds it

latin in ans or ens.

Q. Whereof is it formed?
R. Of the first person singular of the Preterimperfect tense of the Indicative
mode.

R. Four, that is to say, a verb

Active. Newter. Deponent. Common.
Q. How know ye a Participle of the Future in rus?
R. A Participle of the Future in rus is englished like the Infinitive mode
Active. And his Latin ends in rus as amaturus to love or about to love.

Q. Whereof is the Participle in rus formed?
R. Of the latter Supine.

Q. How so?
R. By putting to rus as Doceo the latter supine is Doctu to the which I put
rus, and so is made Docturus.

Q. What kinds of verbes may have a Participle in rus?
R. Four kinds, that is a verb

Active. Newter. Deponent. Common.

R. By putting s to the latter supine, as of Doceo, the latter supine is Doctu,
to the which I put s, and so is made the Participle Doctus, except Mo^u^us.

Q. How many kinds of verbes may have a Participle of the preter tense?
R. Three properly, that is, a verb

Passive. Deponent. Common.
Yet some verbes Newters have also a Participle of the Preter tense.

Q. What if these verbes lack Supines?
R. Then there can be no Participle of the preter tense nor of the future in
rus, and the Passive whose Active lacks Supines can have no preterperfect
tense.

Q. Why so?
R. Because the Preterperfect tense of the Passive is made of the Participle of
the Preter tense, and the verb, Sum, es, fui.

Q. How know ye a Participle of the future in dus?
R. A Participle of the Future in dus, is englished like the Infinitive mode
Passive, and in latin ends in dus.

Q. Whereof is a Participle of the future in dus formed?
R. Of the genitive case of the Participle of the present tense.

Q. How?
R. By changing the last syllable which is it is into dus, as amo, the
Participle of the present tense is amans, ye genitive case amantis, change it is
into dus and so is made ama^dus.

Q. How many kinds of verbes may have a Participle in dus?
R. Two properly, that is, a verb

Passive. Common.
But some verbes Newters have also a Participle in dus.

As also the verb Deponent has, if he govern an Accusative case after him.

Q. What accidents has a Participle?

but a nowne.

Q. How many ways may Participles be turned into nownes?
R. Four ways namely, when they 1 Are compounded with such words as the
verbes which they come of cannot be compounded withal. when they 2 Govern an

R. The ordering of conjunctions in sentences, for some be

1 set before, as nam, quare, ac, ast, atque, et, aut, vel nec, neque, si,
quin, quatenus, sin, seu, sieve, ni, nisi. set after, as quide^, quoque, autem,
vero, enim, and 2 que, ve, ne, called encliticae coniunctiones quod accentum in
praecedentem syllabam inclinent. 3 set indifferently, sometime before, sometime
after, such are almost all other conjunctions.
Of a Praeposition.
Q. Which is the third of your parts of speech undeclined?
R. A preposition.

Q. How know you a preposition?
R. A preposition is a part of speech most commonly set before other parts of
speech, either in apposition or in composition, for he is called a preposition
a praeponendo, that is to say, of setting before.

Q. Is a preposition then always set before the other parts of speech with
whom he is joined.
R. Not always, for these four Cum. Tenus. Versus. Vsque. may be set after
the case which they govern, and sometime penes also. as Quibuscum. Pube
tenus. Angliam versus. Ad occide^te^ vsque me penes.

Q. How many things chance to a preposition?
R. This one thing especially, governing of cases.

Q. What cases do prepositions govern.
R. Some govern an

Accusative case only. an Ablative case only. both an Accusative and an
Ablative. an Ablative and a Genitive.
Q. How many prepositions govern an Accusative case.
R. These 32. Ad to. Apud at. Ante before. Aduersus Aduersum. against. Cis
Citra on this side. Circum Circa about Contra against. Erga toward. Extra
without. Intra within. Inter between. Infra beneath. Iuxta beside or nigh to Ob

secretly or privily. De E Ex of or from. Pro for. Prae before or in co^pariso^.
Palam openly. Sine Absque without. Tenus until or up to.

Q. How many prepositions do govern both an Accusative case and an Ablative?
R. These 4. In. when it signifies into, unto, toward, or against, governs
an Accusative case, when it signifies no more but only in, it governs an
ablative case. Sub when it signifies unto, by, about, or before, governs an
accusative case, when it signifies under, governs an ablative case. Super
when it signifies beyond, governs an Accusative case, when it signifies of
or in, governs an Ablative case. Subter under, in this one signification
governs both an Accusative and an Ablative case.

Q. Which govern an Ablative case and a Genetiue?
R. Tenus governs an Ablative case both in ye singular number and in the
plural. He governs a Genitive case also, but that must ever be the plural
number.

Crure tenus

Cruribus tenus Crurum tenus but not Cruris tenus.
Q. Do all prepositions govern cases?
R. No forsooth these 6. Am. Di. Dis. Re. Se. Con.
are never found aloue with cases, but always co^pounded with other words.

Q. Be your other prepositions never found alone without cases?
R. Yes forsooth, but then they be Aduerbes.

Q. How so?
R. For prepositions when they be set alone without their case, or when they
form comparison, be not prepositions, but are changed into Aduerbes.

Of an Interiection.
Q. What is the last part of speech?
R. An Interiection.

Q. How know ye an Interiection?
R. An Interiection is a part of speech which betokens some sudden
affection or passion of the mind in an imperfect voice.

Q. How many things chance to an Interiection?
R. This one, namely signification.

Q. What significations has an Interiection?
R. So many as there be motions or passions of the mind.

Q. Tell me the several significations of an Interiection.
R. Some be of

mirth. sorrow. dread. marueyling. disdayning. shunning. praising. scorning.
exclamation. cursing. laughing. calling. silence.
Of Construction.
Q. Which is the third part of Grammar?
R. Syntaxis.

Q. What mean ye by this?
R. It is a Greek word compounded of Syn and Taxis, in Latin it is
interpreted Constructio or Coordinatio in English Construction or framing
together.

Q. What is Construction?
R. It is the due ordering or framing together of words, in speech.

Q. How many sorts or manners of Construction have ye?
R. Two, that is to say the

perfect, natural, or usual construction. figured or fined Construction.
Q. Which of these parts do ye learn in your Accidence?
R. The first part which I called the perfect or natural construction.

Q. How many things are to be considered for the due framing together of
words according to the perfect or natural construction.
R. Two, that is to say, Three special agreementes of words, which we call
the three concordes. And the three rules for the particular construction of
every part of speech by him self.


Q. Which be your three agreementes of words or your three concordes.
R. The

1 Between the nominative case and the verb. 2 Between the Substantive and
the Adjective. 3 Between the Antecedent and the Relative.
Q. Why be they called Concordes;
R. Because they do concord, that is to say, agree mutually together in some
special accidents, so that the three latter cannot stand perfectly in speech
without the three former.

Q. What terms have ye for them in Grammar?
R. The three former, that is, the Nominative case, the substantive and the
Antecedent, be called Subiecta as it were the pillars or vpholders or under
setters of the other.

The latter three, that is to say, the verb, the Adjective, and the relative,
may be called Adiecta, which we may term in English the weakelings, or the
wauerers, or the leaners: because they be of them selves weak and wavering,
except they do as it were lean to their pillars or vndersetters.

Q. How do these Adiecta agree with their Subiecta?
R. I have for every one of these Concordes or agreements certain proper rules
to show how they do agree together.

The first Concord.
Q. Which is the rule for the first Concord?
R. A verb personal agrees with his Nominative case in two things, that is,
in number and person.

Q. Must the verb Personal then always be the same number and person that
his nominative case is?
R. No forsooth, not always: for I have three exceptions.

Q. Which be they?
R. The first is this, when I have more Nominative cases, then one coming
together with a conjunction copulative between them, although they be all the
singular number, yet my verb must be put in the plural number, but it must be
such person as the most worthy Nominative case is.

Q. Which call ye the most worthy nominative case?
R. The Nominative case of the first person is more worthy then the second,
and the nominative case of the second person is more worthy then the third.

Q. Which is your second exception?
R. When a verb comes between two Nominative cases of diverse numbers, it
may indifferently accord either with that which goes before him, or with that
which comes after him, so that they be both of one person.

Q. Which is the third exception?
R. This. The Nominative case to the verb is not always a casual word, but
sometime a whole sentence, sometime a piece of a sentence, sometime an
Infinitive mode, sometime an Aduerbe with a Genitive case.

Q. What call you a casual word?
R. Such a word as is declined with cases, namely a nowne, a pronowne, and a
participle.

Q. How can a whole sentence, a piece of a sentence, an infinitive mode or an
Aduerbe with a Genitive case be Nominative case to the verb?
R. When they stand for the Nominative case they be taken altogether as it
were a Substantive, and may be supposed to be declined altogether like hoc
nihil indeclinabile.

Q. Why so?
R. Because nothing can be the Nominative case to the verb, but a substantive
or that which is taken as a substantive.

Q. Why, the relative may be the Nominative case to the verb, and yet he is
no substantive?
R. The Relative as touching his case stands for a substantive and is always
aunsweared to in his case severally as a Substantive.

Q. May not an adjective be nominative case to the verb?
R. Yes, but then he must be put alone without a substantive in the Newter
gender, and so supply the place of a substantive.

Q. What number and person shall the verb be when a whole sentence, a piece
of a sentence, an Infinitive mode, or an Aduerbe with a genitive case is the
nominative case to the verb?
R. If it have respect but to one thing, it shall be the singular number, and the
third person. If it have respect to more things then one, it shall be the plural
number and 3. person.

Q. In making and construing Latin, where shall I put the Nominative case?
R. For the most part before the verb: but sometime after the verb.

Q. When is the Nominative case put after the verb?
R. At 3 times, when

We ask a question. the verb is the Imperative mode. the sign it or there
comes before ye english of ye verb.
Q. How will ye find out the nominative case to the verb?
R. Put the question who or what with the english of the verb and the word in
the sentence that answeareth that question is the nominative case.

Q. How many things may be the nominative case to the verb?
R. Five, that is to say. a 1 Casual word and yt is either a Substantive.
Relative. 2 Whole reason or sentence Substantive. Relative. 3 Clause or piece
of a sentence Adjective standing for a substantive. 4 Infinitive mode of a
verb Adjective standing for a substantive. 5 Aduerb with a genitive case
Adjective standing for a substantive.

Of the second Concord.
Q. Which is the rule of the second Concord?
R. The Adjective whether it be nowne, pronowne or participle agrees with his
substantive in 3. things, that is Case, Gender, and Number.

Q. Why, have ye more Adjectives then of nownes?
R. Yea forsooth. Very many nownes. be adjectives. Al Pronownes saving Ego, tu,
sui, be adjectives. All Participles. be adjectives.


Q. Is an Adjective always the same Case, Gender, and Number that his
Substantive is?
R. Not always, for I have 3. such exceptions as I have in the first Concord.

Q. Which is the first exception for the second Concord?
R. Many Substantives singular with a Conjunction Copulative coming between
them will have an Adjective plural, which Adjective shall agree with the
Substantive of the most worthy gender?

Q. Which is the Substantive of the most worthy gender?
R. The Substantive of the Masculine gender is more worthy then ye feminine,
and the substantive of the feminine gender is more worthy then the Newter.

Q. Is this ever true?
R. Nay, for in things not apt to have life, the Newter ge^der is most worthy.

Q. Which is the second exception for the second Concord?
R. When an Adjective comes between two Substa^tiues of diverse Genders it may
indifferently accord with either of them.

Q. Which is the third exception for the second concord?
R. This, the Substantive is not always a casual word, but sometime a whole
sentence, sometime a piece of a sentence, sometime an Infinitive mode, and
sometime an Aduerb with a Genitive case.

Q. What case, gender, and number, shall the Adjective be when any of these is
his Substantive?
R. He shall be such case as they are accounted to be, and if it have respect but
to one thing as one sentence, or one piece of a sentence, it shall be the Newter
Gender and singular number: but if it have respect to more things then one, or
to more sentences, or more pieces of sentences it shall be the Newter Gender
and plural Number.

Q. How will ye find out the substantive to the Adjective?
R. Put the question who or what to the English of ye Adjective, and the word
or words in the sentence that answer that question is the Substantive to it.

Q. How many things may be substantive to the adjective?
R. Whatsoever is nominative case to the verb, the same may be Substantive to
the Adjective.

The third Concord.
Q. Which is the rule of the third Concord?
R. This, the Relative agrees with his Antecedent in three things, that is,

Gender. Number. Person.
Q. Is the Relative always the same gender, number, and person that his
Antecedent is?
R. Not always, for I have here the same three exceptions, that I have in the
first Concord and in the second.

Q. Which is the first exception for the third Concord?
R. When I have more Antecedentes then one of the singular number coming
together with a Conjunction copulative between them, then the Relative shall
be put in the plural number, and agree in gender with the Antecedent of the
most worthy gender.

Q. What mean ye by Antecedent?
R. The Antecedent is any such word as goes in the sentence before the
relative and is rehearsed again by the Relative.

Q. Which is the second exception for the third concord?
R. When a Relative comes between two substantives or antecedentes of diverse
genders, it may indifferently accord with either of them, yea though they be
both of diverse numbers also.

Q. Which is the third exception for the third concord?
R. The Antecedent is not always a casual word, but sometime a whole
sentence, sometime a piece of a sentence, sometime an Infinitive mode, sometime
an Aduerbe with a genitive case.

Q. What gender, number and person shall the Relative be when he has any of
these Antecedentes?
R. If he have respect but to one thing, one sentence, or one piece of a
sentence: he shall be the Newter gender, singular number and third person: but if
he have respect to more then one: he shall be the Newter gender, plural number,
and third person.

Q. How many things may be antecedent to the Relative?
R. Whatsoever is nominative case to the verb, the same may be Antecedent to
the Relative.

Q. How will ye find out the Antecedent to the Relative?
R. Put the question who or what to the English of the Relative, and the word
or words in the sentence that aunsweareth the question is the Antecedent.

Q. How shall I order the case of the Relative?
R. The Relative for his case always supplieth the place of a Substantive, and
must be aunsweared to severally as a Substantive.

Q. Have ye none other rules for the case of the Relative then ye have for
substantives?
R. Yes I have two special rules for the case of the Relative but they are all
one in effect with the rules of Substantives.

Q. Which is the first rule for the case of the Relative?
R. When there comes no nominative case between the Relative and the verb,
the Relative shall be the nominative case to the verb.

Q. Which is the second rule for the case of the Relative?
R. When there comes a nominative case between the Relative and the verb:
then the Relative shall not be the nominative case to the verb: but shall be
governed of the verb, or of some other word in the same sentence.

Q. What mean you by shall be governed?
R. To be governed is to be such case as the verb or any other part of speech
will have after him.

Q. Then if the Relative be not nominative case to ye verb, must he not follow
the verb or some other word in the same sentence, whereof he is governed?
R. No forsooth, he must indeed be such case as the verb or some other word in
the same sentence will have after him, but the Relatiues qui, qualis, and
quantus be set before the verb and not after.

Q. How so?
R. For it is the nature of these Relatiues to stand before yt word whereof
they be governed.

Q. Does no words else stand before the words which they be governed of but the
Relative?
R. Yes, for the substantive which is joined with ye Relative does follow the
nature of the Relative?

Q. Show me an example of this?
R. If the Relative be joined in like case, gender, and number with a
Substantive, if there come also an other Substantive both the Relative, and the
Substantive with which he is joined, shall be the genitive case, and yet shall
stand before the other Substantive, as Scaeuola nobis exposuit Lelii sermonem
de amicitia, cuius disputationis sententias memoriae mandaui,

Q. Show me how stands this with your rule?
R. Here I have Cuius disputationis sententias, whereas the Relative cuius
agrees in Case, Gender, and Number, with disputation is both which in order
are placed before the other Substantive sententias, and yet are the genitive
case, because the latter of two substantives coming together must be the
genitive case.

Q. But if the Relative be not Nominative case to ye verb, what case must he
then be?
R. If he be not Nominative case to the verb, then look what case any nowne
substantive should be being governed of the same word, the same case must the
Relative be and by the same rule.

Q. How will ye know of what word yt Relative is governed?
R. By putting for the Relative the same case of hic, haec, hoc, and so
construing the sentence. For then yt case of hic, haec, hoc which is put for
the Relative will in construing follow the word that the Relative is governed
of.

Q. In what order are the rules for the construction of every part of speech to
be considered?
R. In such order as ye parts of speech be rehearsed in mine Accidence. The
rules for the construction of

1 Nownes Substantives. 2 Nownes Adjectives. 3 Pronownes, 4 Verbes Personalles.
5 Gerundes. 6 Supines. 7 Verbes Impersonalles. 8 Participles, and so forth in
such order as the parts of speech be rehearsed in mine Accidence.
Q. What order keep ye in the placing of these rules?
R. The rules for every part of speech stand according to the order of the
cases.

1 First, the rules for ye nominative case if the part of speech govern a
nominative case after him. 2 Secondly, the rules for the Genitive case. 3
Thirdly, the rules for the Dative case. 6 Fourthly, the rules for the
Accusative case. 7 Lastly, the rules for the Ablative case.
Q. Why leave ye out the rules for the vocative case?
R. For the vocative case is not governed of any other part of speech except
an Interiection.

Q. Then how know ye when to put a word in the Vocative case?
R. This one rule is sufficient for it. Whenever I call or speak to any
thing or person it is the Vocative case.

Q. How will ye find out the rule for any word in a sentence, to know why
he is put in the nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative or Ablative case?
R. First I must look what part of speech the word is which I have to seek
out, secondly of what word he is governed, thirdly what part of speech that
word is whereof he is governed, lastly I must look what case my word is, and
so shall I turn to the rules that be for that part of speech and for that case.

Q. Show me it by example?
R. If my word be a substantive and the genitive case, and governed of a nowne
Adjective, then I turn to the rules yt I have for Adjectives that govern a
genitive case.

If my word be a Substantive, the genitive case, and governed of a verb, then
I turn to my rules for verbes which govern a genitive case. Then I consider
of what signification ye word is whereof he is governed, and so I take the
rule that agrees to that signification.

Q. But how will ye know of what word the same case which you seek is
governed?
R. That must be learned by diligent marking how the sentence is construed.

Q. Why so?
R. Because every case is governed of that word which goes next before him in
the natural construing of a sentence.

Q. What mean ye by construing?
R. Construing is the right placing of every word yt is written in a sentence,
in the natural order of speech, and giving to every word his proper
signification in english.

Q. Show me how?
R. Virtutis comes est inuidia. This sentence is construed thus. Inuidia envy,
est is, comes yt companion, virtutis of virtue.

Q. If ye have a sentence given to be construed, what order will ye keep in
englishing and placing of every word?
R. Diverse men teach diversely, but this way is plain and not unprofitable. If
there be any vocative case in the sentence I take that first. Secondly, the
Nominative case, or that which is put in steed of the nominative case, and to
him I adioyne any word that hangs upon him. Then take I the verb
Personal. Then the Aduerb. After this the cases in their own order. The
Accusative case next after the verb, and that which hangs upon him, then
the Genitive, and so the Dative, and last the Ablative.

Q. What if there be not al these kinds of words in yt se^te^ce?
R. Then take so many of them as be in it, and in this order, and always take
heed that ye put that case next after the verb, which yt verb does properly
govern after him, and the^ the other cases in order.

The Accusative case goes before the Infinitive Mode, the Infinitive comes
after any other mode. The Adjective and the Substantive must be construed
together except one of the^ does pass over his signification into some other
word.

Q. May this order be always kept?
R. No forsooth, for it is broken many times by the cases of Relatiues,
Interrogatiues, Infinitiues and Genitiues of partition and by some Conjunctions
etc.

Q. If you have an english given to be made in latin, what must you do?
R. First I must look out the principal verb in the sentence.

Q. How will ye find out the principal verb?
R. It is always the first verb, except the first verb be the Infinitive
mode, or have before it a Relative or a Conjunction.

Q. What will ye do when ye have found out the principal verb?
R. Then I must seek out his Nominative case.

Q. What seek ye out after the Nominative case?
R. After I have made the verb and his Nominative case, I consider what part
of speech every word in the sentence is beside these: and then I join them in
such order as I do in construing of a sentence, and so make every one of them
into latin.

For the Genders of Nownes.
Q. How will ye find out the genders of a Nowne?
R. I have certain rules in Latin verses for the Genders of nownes.

Q. How will ye seek out the Gender of a Nowne by these rules.
R. First, I must look whether it be a proper name or a common.

Q. What if it be a proper name?
R. Then I have two general rules for his gender.

Q. Which be they?
R. The first is this. Propria quae maribus tribuuntur mascula dicas. etc. The
second is this. Propria faemineum referentia nomina sexum, Faemineo geneti
tribuuntur.


Q. How will ye know whether it be a proper name or no?
R. If it be a proper name, it is one of these ten. As proper names of Gods.
Men. Fluddes. Months Winds.
And these be all the masculine gender. Goddesses Women. Cities. Countries
Islands.
and these be all ye feminine gender for the most part.

Q. Be not all those latter five the feminine gender as well as all the first
five be the masculine.
R. No, for certain names of Cities be excepted?

Q. What gender be those that be excepted?
R. These two of the masculine gender, Sulmo, Agragas, these of the newter
gender, Argos, Tibur, Preneste.

This one Anxur, which is sometime the masculine, sometime the newter.

Q. What if your nowne be no proper name?
R. Then I must look whether it be not the name of a tree.

Q. What if it be the name of a tree?
R. Then I have this rule for him.

Appellatiua arborum erunt muliebria vt alnus.

Q. What gender must your nowne be by this rule?
R. The feminine.

Q. Be all names of trees the feminine gender?
R. No.

Q. Then how will ye know the gender of such Nownes as do not agree with the
rule?
R. All such nownes as do not agree with the rule, either be rehearsed by
name straight after the rule, or else there is some special rule of exeception
set down for them.

Q. What nownes have ye excepted from this rule.
R. Two of the Masculine gender, Pinus and Oleaster five of the Newter gender,
Siler, Suber, Thus, Robur, and Acer.

Q. What if your nowne be neither proper name nor name of a tree?
R. Then he is a nowne common, or a nowne appellatiue.

Q. How will ye seek out the gender of a now appellatiue?
R. First, I must look in his genetiue case whether it does increase or no.

Q. Why so?
R. For I have three special rules referred to the genitive case of a nowne
common, whereby I may learn his gender.

Q. Which be they?
R. The first is, Nomen non crescens Genitiuo seu caro carnis. etc. The second
is Nome^ crescentis penultima si Genitiui, syllaba accuta sonet. etc. The
third is, Nomen crescentis Penultima, si Genitiui fit grauis. etc.

Q. What manner of no wnes belong to your first rule?
R. All such as do not increase in the Genitive case?

Q. When are nownes said to increase in the genitive case?
R. When they have mo syllables in the Genitive case then they have in the
Nominative.

Q. What gender then must those nownes be, by this rule which do not increase
in the Genitive case?
R. All those which do agree with the rule be the feminine gender.

Q. Did you not say that all nownes which do not increase in the Genitive case
do agree with the rule?
R. No forsooth, I said in deed that all nownes which do not increase in the
genitive case do belong to the first rule but all they do not agree with the
rule.

Q. What difference do ye put between these two words belonging and agreeing.
R. I count all those to belong to the rule which be of the same sort of
nownes that the rule is made for, though they be not the same gender which
the rule appointes them to be: but I count none to agree with the rule but
such as both be of the same sorts of Nownes, that the rule is made for, and
also be the same gender that the rule appointes them to be.

Q. Then what gender be those nownes that be excepted from this first rule.
R. First, some of the Masculine gender contained in this note of exception.
Mascula nomina in a dicuntur multa virorum etc. and in this note. Mascula in er
ceu venture in os vel us, vt logos annus.

Secondly some of the newter Gender contained in this note. Newtrum nomen in e
si gignit is etc.

Thirdly some of the doubfull gender contained in this note of exception.
Incertigeneris sunt talpa et dama canalis, etc.

Lastly, some of the common of two contained in this rule of exception.
Compositum a verbo dans a commune duorum est. etc.

Q. Have ye not also some of the feminine gender excepted, contained in this
note. Feminei generis sunt matter humus domus. etc.
R. No forsooth, this is no exception from the first rule, for all these nownes
in this exception be the feminine gender, and do agree with the first rule, but
these be excepted from the second rule of exception. Mascula in er ceu venture
in os vel in us. etc.

Q. How so?
R. For whereas he had made that rule that nownes which end in er, os or us
were the masculine gender, he found these nowns so ending to be the feminine
gender, and therefore he put them here in an exception from that rule.

Q. What manner of nownes belong to your second rule?
R. All such nownes as do increase in the genitive case, and have the last
syllable saving one lifted up sharp in sound, as virtus virtutis.

Q. What Gender be those nownes that belong to this rule?
R. All those that do agree with the rule be the feminine gender.

Q. And what gender are those that are excepted?
R. Some be of the Masculine gender contained in this note of exception.
Mascula dicuntur monosyllaba nomina quaedam. And in this. Mascula sunt etiam
polysyllaba. etc. And in this Mascula in er, or et os. etc.

Some be the newter gender contained in this note Sunt neutralia et haec
monosyllaba nomina. etc.

Some be the doubtful contained in this note. Sunt dubia haec python, etc.

Some be the common of two contained in this note. Sunt commune parens. etc.

Q. What manner of nownes belong to your third rule?
R. All such as do increase in the genitive case and have the last syllable
saving one pronownced flat or pressed down, as Sanguis Sanguinis.

Q. What gender be those nownes which belong to this rule?
R. All those that do agree with the rule be the masculine gender.

Q. What gender be those that be excepted?
R. Some of the femenine gender contained in this note of exception.
Faemineigeneris sit hyperdissyllabon in do.

Some of the newter gender contained in this note. Est neutrale genus signans
rem non animatam. etc.

Some of the doubtful contained in this note. Sunt dubil generis cardo margo.
etc.

Some of the common of two contained in this note. Communis generis sunt ista
vigil pugil. etc.

For the praeterperfect tenses of simple verbes.
Q. How will ye seek out the preterperfect tense of a verb?
R. I have certain rules in latin verses for the forming of them.

Q. How will ye find out the preterperfect tense of a verb by those rules?
R. First, I must look whether the verb be simple or compounde.

Q. Why so?
R. Because the preterperfect tense of a compounde verb is most commonly made
of the preterperfect tense of the simple verb, of which he is compounded.

Q. What if your verb be simple?
R. Then I must look whether he ends o, or in or.

Q. Why so?
R. Because the preterperfect tense of verbes in or be formed of the latter
supine of verbes in o.

Q. What if your verb end in o?
R. If the verb end in o and be either of the first, the second or the fourth
Conjugation: I shall find out his preterperfect tense by that rule which is
made for the termination of the second person singular of the presentense of
the indicative mode or by the rules of exception.

Q. What is the termination of the second person singular in the present tense
