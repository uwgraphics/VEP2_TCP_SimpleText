MAN Driven out of the Earth and Darkness, By the Light, life, and mighty hand
of God: Where in plain and simple truths are brought to light, that so the
cause of stumbling may be taken from before the eyes of the Rulars, and all
sorts of professors in Herefordshire, that out of their minds, such things may
be removed which hinder them from the love of the truth, and that their
understandings may be opened, and receive the truth which makes free and
believe in the light.

Wherein is something related of the wonderful power of God, in the work of
redemption and restoration, with a plain self denial by him that takes up the
daily Cross.

Written as a visitation of free and tender love to the captivated seed of God
in them, who to him are not yet restored, from their friend who is now a
servant of Jesus Christ, and suffers for the testimony of a pure conscience, in
this filthy stinking, wicked, abominable Prison, being the Common Gole and
house of Correction at Winchester, called of men Humphery Smith.

London Printed, in the 11th. month 1658.

Behold the Lord works wonderfully, every morning he brings his judgments
to light, he has brought me back from the grave and saved my soul from hell,
and set my feet upon a Rock.
THe living truth of the Lord God which he has revealed in me, by the mighty
operation of his word of life, which living eternal truth being my life and
shall last for evermore, and be as a standard of the most high lifted up to all
the scattered weary souls, that they may flow unto it, and have it to be unto
them a place of refuge and defense, to fly unto in the day of distress, and by
it come to be made free, and in it, worship the God of the spirits of all flesh
and feel it in the inward parts, according as the Lord requires, by which
truth man comes to be sanctified; for the word that lives and abides for ever
is truth, which comes to be ingrafted into them who believe in the light, and
in it wait for the promise of the Father, even that spirit of truth which the
world cannot receive, for they know it not, it being in Gods wisdom hid from
the wisdom of the world, who know not him that may be felt after and found,
who is near unto every one of you, whose measure of light in you, is it you are
all to know; by it to come to know the eternal power and godhead as they did
who had not Scriptures, Romans 1.19. For the light of Christ in you is that which
is to give the knowledge of God, 2 Cor. 4.6. who has asuredly revealed his son
in me, and led me in the straight way to life eternal, and the enjoyment of the
truth which is immortal, the which being to me a pearl of great price, and more
precious then a thousand Rivers of Oil.

And that none may be hindered from receiving of this which I have most
assuredly found to be more excellent then the royalty of Diadems, or the
excellency of the most purest Gold, or the most renownedst glory, beauty or
riches, that the natural eye can behold; and that all who breaths after divine
refreshings, and the rest that never shall be shaken, and the attaining to the
covenant of life and peace, may come to be gathered into the one fold of
blessed happiness, and rest upon the rock of ages, and never more be moved
henceforth and for ever.

And that if possible all murmurings and reasonings (concerning me or what I
was) may be taken out of the minds of all people of all sorts, and that all
jelousies, whisperings, and heart burnings in the wrathful nature may be
passified and cooled with the overspreading stremes of Gods free love, which
truly is shed and grows in my heart, and stremeth forth as a wellspring of
life toward the seed that is yet oppressed in them, among whom sometime I
walked in darkness, and wallowed in unrighteousness; and afterward stood up as
a tall Cedar in the height of profession, preaching great and high things daily
unto others: where by the I was admired by many hundreds, who thereby came not
to receive power, to overcome their sins, neither yet attain to that which the
souls of many of the thirsted after, whom since I have often mourned over in
pity, and in the bowels of my fathers love to the seed in bondage in them,
from whom I have been long and far absent in body.

And that none of them by looking and wondering at me, or any thing tat has
befallen me may stumble thereby at the light or truth it self, or be thereby
kept from receiving the living truth, or from giving heed to that which all the
wise master builders refuse; nor that they by looking at what I was, before I
received and lived in the truth, and at that which justly came upon me for my
former rebellion against the light, nor at the judgments of God that come upon
me within or without, because of my unwillingness to follow him who said I am
the light, follow me, and said, He that will not leave father and mother, wife
and children, goods or lands for my sake, is not worthy of me; and he that will
not deny himself, and take up his Cross and follow me, is not worthy of me: and
what a cross it was for me to leave what I did, let that of God (in all that
then knew me) judge, but I say, that none of them who were Colonels, Captains,
Justices, Professors nor people, by looking out at any thing concerning me, may
not be withheld from receiving the truth, and so kept from that which is the
way to the father, and the door to the rest for evermore.

Therefore has it lay long, (of late years) and often upon me, and that from
the hand of the Lord, to lay something before your eyes (O ye rulers,
professors, and people of Herefordshire and thereabout) endeavoring thereby to
remove any cause of stumbling, by reason of what I was, or of any false reports
raised upon me, whereby the whole truth of God might be evil spoken of. And
this have I waited long to declare among you, either in words, writing or
print; though thereby shame might come upon my former course of life, when I
lived in all manner of sin and iniquity, [except it were actual adultery,
fornication, and murder,] and though also hereby, contempt may come upon all
that great profession I was in, when I preached daily in the Sinagogue, or upon
all that I then spoke or preached, out of the innocent life of God; or if hereby
at present sufter I reproach, (as it is like I may by many) yet the reproach of
Christ is greater riches to me, then the treasuer-glory and preferment of
England.

And first concerning my call out of the world, or my going out from my house,
country and outward employment.
The light of Christ which condemns the evil deeds, comes from him who calls
his out of the world, and from their employments to follow him, who puts
forth his sheep and thrusts fourth laborers into the harvest, and Abraham of
whose seed I now am, went out of his country, and from his fathers house, Genesis
12. and him God blessed and increased mightily, and the Lord also called, and
thrust forth me, who at last was obedient to the command of the God of Abraham,
and ever since his presence has been with me, and his mighty hand of power
has preserved me, and his blessings have I found, and the increasings of God
have I received, praises to the Lord God of life for evermore; who has called
me by his word of power through his grace, which did teach me to deny
ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to obey his blessed will, which was and is
my sanctification in Jesus Christ, who did also call Matthew from the receipt of
custom to follow him, and Peter and John from their employment of fishing, and
made them fishers of men; and Paul also being called, left his employment of
rent-making (after a time) and was obedient to the heavenly vision, and those
then became a wonder and a gazing stock to many, yet they continued on,
traveling through many countries as I since have done preaching the word of
God with boldness.

And one of these men who were called from their outward employments, said,
every man wherein he is called there abide, and whereunto they were called they
did abide, (and so do I) and when the Priests and Rulers would have stopped their
mouths by their commands, they said whether it be lawful to hearken unto God
or man, judge ye, but these called Ministers of Christ did not say, he that is
a husbandman there abide, for Noah was a husbandman yet a preacher of
righteousness, and Elisha a plowman, and Amos a herdman, neither did they say,
he that is a fisherman let him so abide; neither did Christ say, he that will
be my disciple must follow his outward employment or trade, but he said he that
will not hate father and mother, brethren and sisters, wife and children, yea
and his own life too, cannot be my Disciple, Luke 14.20. and if not a Disciple
much less a Minister of his.

But hereby neither Christ nor them Ministers of his, neither, I did or do
intend to draw or persuade people to idleness, or open a door for any such
evil, (neither is there many who are called out of the worlds worships, and
required to leave their families and called to the ministry) but that hereby it
may plainly appear, that the command and call of Christ, to his work and
ministry is to be obeyed, though it be to the forsaking of house, goods, or
lands: for a minister of his said we have forsaken all, (and have not I done
so) and unto them who had forsaken all, and unto all such was promised a
hundred fold, Mat. 19.17, 18, 19. And Heaven and Earth shall pass away before
one jot or tittle of his word shall fail; and truly I have found his promise
true, for a hundred times hundredfold have I already received, blessed be the
Lord for ever.

But how contrary it was to my own will to fulfill the will of the Lord, in
leaving my employment and outward business in the world, let all them judge
with the light who knew my conversation therein, and saw my eagerness in the
things of the world and contrivances therein, beyond many men; my heart being
set in the earthly things, being very fierce in laboring therein, for the
getting and increasing of the fruits of the earth, as though I would have laid
up treasure for many years which might have been good in its place, if my mind
had been redeemed out of it and my heart from the covetousness thereof; but I
say again, it was much contrary to my strong will, to leave these things and
the love of them, and much more that might be named and be taken from it with a
hundred fifty pound loss, and exposed to want, hardships, revilings,
imprisonments, whippings, stonings and all manner of cruel tortour, that the
sons of men might have power to inflict upon my body, and for me (that ruled
over many, and was respected by many) to become a servant unto all, and counted
the offscouring of all, and be abused by any boy or the vilest person I meet,
and it was much contrary to my will, to refuse that glory, honor, and
preferment of the world which was offered me by the rulers thereof, when I was
beloved of them and hundreds more; and when I preached among them in the
Pulpits daily, and was then called of men, Master, like the hirelings of
England, who being in the curse cannot cease from sin, 2. Pet. 2.14. yet. I
still refused their unrighteous gain, and denied all their gifts and rewards,
for the Lord in his mercy kept me out of them temptations, though sometimes
some that were then near friends unto me would have persuaded me to have taken
something of what was offered as to live upon, but I durst not, if I had wanted
food or raiment; but answered one Justice who was proposing me a free gift
toward maintenance, which might have been worth 100. l. a year or more seeing I
left my employment freely to preach daily, but I say I answered, I shall rather
go in Sheep skins, and Goat skins, and eat bread and drink water, and that
little honest meek principal in me, which then kept me from that (and such
temptations) in due time led me to be ruler over much, which before I had not
power over; therefore I say unto all, it is good to be faithful to the little
measure of God in the conscience.

For when I was but young and void of the knowledge of God, or his way of
holiness, my mind ran much in the earth, with a covetous care how to gain the
riches thereof; and even then did the hand or the Lord follow me, and his
witness in me did so judge and condemn me night and day for my evil, that at
last I was scarce able to do any thing in the earth or go upon it; and then
waiting to see what the reason was, after many hours, I saw clearly if I
would leave the wickedness of the world, and follow the Lord and trust him, I
might have peace, and if not, I was like to be cut off; and then I left some
sins, and resolved to live more holy, and began to pray and read, and then I
went to follow the Priests, not knowing that in me which I was to hear and
follow, yet it secretly led me out of some evil, and so into some peace, and
then my heart was exalted in the earth, though I increased in a profession.

And when I was in the height of the worlds way and worship, and expecting
riches to increase, even then in an unexpected time did the dread of the Lord
fall upon me, and his wonderful mighty power wrought exceedingly in me, to
break me off from all my ways and separate me from all the worship of the
world, and gave me to see the abominations of all the prayers of the wicked,
and the invalidity of all the worships of all mankind who are out of Gods
Covenant, and the operations then upon me by the terrible hand of the Lord, and
the strivings that were in me can never be declared, and then did the Lord
command me to follow him in obedience to his will, to declare against all
unrighteousness of men Which I saw in the light of life to be in Priests,
Rulers, and people, and I then saw clearly in the eternal light and foresight
of God, the hardships, cruelties, whippings, imprisonments, and dungeon, and
many such things which since in part have been upon this body fulfilled as may
be read in several of my books, (read the true Rule) and at that time did the
powerful life of God, so much break through me, with such unspeakable love,
that I was even willing to leave all and walk with God.

But then contrary to Paul, I reasoned with flesh and blood, that I should be
esteemed a madman, and that people would not believe me, and that I was not
fit (and many such things) then the word of the Lord was spoken in me, saying
who is it, that opens the mouth, is it not I the Lord; then was my bowels
even turned within me, with the constraining power of Gods eternal love, and I
began to be vvilling but when that was a little over, The tempter being near,
I reasoned concerning my wife and children, how they should be provided for,
and presently the promise of the Lord was, that they should be cared for, and
his promise was to me that he who converteth souls to God, should shine as the
Stars for ever, and when I had received them words into me, I was overcome
with the refreshings of God, and at the present made vvilling to undergo all
tribulations, if in my whole life, I did convert but one soul to God, seeing
and feeling the redemption of one soul to be so precious, the which then grew
so strong in me, that I was scarce able to retain, from present actual
obedience to God therein, but when I looked at my outvvard things and how first
to settle that in order, then was I by temptations made afraid, that it was a
delusion, or something of the Devil tansformed as an Angel of light, and then
between both, I was in much trouble and distress, not knowing what to do,
having not then known any called Quakers, nor any such operations in any man in
those days, yet that could hardly prevail to make me believe it was a
temptation: but at last, reasoning about outvvard things, I then resolved not
to leave them, but to mind the things of the world, and not obey that which
called me out of the world.

And to write in short, at last I did strive and join withal the powers of
darkness that I could, and used all means possible to drive the power of God
from me, and the thoughts of him and his works out of my mind; but woo was me
after for it, and it had been but just, if his Spirit had never strived more
with me, but left me to be cut off for ever, and to remain in the horrible pit
of darkness, (and surely it was for the good of others, that the Lord did
spare me, some whereof may now with me rejoice for evermore,)

For when all was too little to overcome the mighty power of God in me, then
did the love of the world prevail, and even thirstings, for the love of it to
come in to my heart, to drive out the love of God; at last, I with it against
God prevailed, though the living power of God was so great, that the Devil the
Flesh, and the world, was scarce able to overcome it for a time, and so I have
seen, Children Wife, Farms, and Oxen, to hinder from the Kingdom of God, but
that which hindered most, was the love of outward goods, and so it it was but
just with God, to take that at the last out of the way; and if he had swept all
away in his Anger, as from Job, he had done me no wrong.

But when I had thus, in a cursed manner overcome the striving of the sweet and
lovely Spirit of Truth, yet was I not quiet, but much troubled, and in a sad
condition, which I was not able to hide from the world, who said, I was going
mad, seeing me so changed into sadness, but of all this and much more, I durst
not then speak a word to any creature.

And now mark, what for my rebellion did justly follow; My outward goods which
I then loved more then Christ, became as a prey, and a spoil to unreasonable
men, and most unjustly on their parts, was I by them deprived of it, and the
Lord also dried up all my springs within, that such a time after I knew that I
was left without hope, being in the horrible pit of Darkness from God, that I
could neither pray nor believe, but resolved that I was accursed from God for
ever, (and that which disobeyed was so,) and being in a sad miserable
condition, resolved to write a warning to all people, that they may take
example by me, and never resist the Spirit, as I had done, but before I could
write, (sinking down into the condemnation, without murmuring against God,
knovving him to be just, if he cast me into the nethermost hell for ever; the
Lord had compassion on me, and lifted my soul out of the horrible pit, and
stayed me with his hand for a time: yet afterward, his afflictions follovved
me in judgments within, and much trouble in things without, which my heart
was so upon, and yet for a long time I turned not unto the Lord that did
smite, that his hand might make whole, though checks I had by his light, in my
conscience, but strong was my will about it, until the fierce judgment of
the Lord did often break forth upon me with much astonishment of heart, and
horrible indignation not to be uttered, with tears as streams of water from
mine eyes night and day when it came upon me, with tremblings and breakings,
which broke the hardness of my heart, and opened away to something in me,
with then I dearly loved; but going out agin from that, I reasoned about my
outvvards, and not waiting to receive counsel from the Lord, I went unto a
rich understanding man, in outvvard things, whom I loved, who may yet
remember that I made my complaint unto, that I was not able any longer to
abide in the way of the world; whose counsel I then took and my own will
together, and so sought to keep two Kingdoms sometime longer, and therefore
much trouble follovved me within and vvasting loss, shame and destruction
upon things without.

But however I durst do no less then follow the Lord; and be obedient unto
him, whatever loss I suffered, or whatever shame or reproach I might undergo,
though often times I was afraid, that this power of God in me, would soon come
to an end, or fail from me, and that then I might return to my outward
Employment with great shame and loss, and that then, instead of doing service
for God, I might bring a reproach upon his Blessed Name, and my self, thereby,
be a hissing stock to all men, and they say I began to build and not able to
finish, and this also kept me back very much; but such was the everlasting love
of the Lord, who is known in the ways of his judgments, that his hand was
heavy upon me, and his judgments increased in me, that there was no way for me
to escape, but I must be obedient and bow under it, or be cut off for every by
it, so that my bowels were often pained in me, and it is like for many weeks
had little sleep or bodily rest, and sometimes knew not my wife and children,
that I seeled and heard breath in the bed by me, but thought they were people
that I should not be with; and therefore one time after it was day, I was
rising and putting on my clothes in a sober manner, and in meekness said,
surely I should not be here, and my wife then laying hand on me, easily
persuaded me, but I said, I know not who I am with, neither did I know her
voice at that time, and sometime after having endured much, I told she and my
family (with heaviness and tears) that I was not able to endure it any longer,
and that I had abode with them in the way of the world, so long as possibly I
could, and that I must give up my life to serve the Lord, desiring them with
tears to be content, and in what I could I should be as careful for their good
as ever I was, and this is true, and but little of what might be written.

For another time formerly the light of Christ in me, (which then I knew not)
did so condemn me, and judge and trouble me in secret, that it brought
sickness upon me, and thereby being weak expecting I should die, I was then
much troubled and it lay much upon my conscience at that time, that I had not
in the time of my health gone to the steeple-house, and in the fear of the Lord
warned all people to repent, and I was then much grieved because I thought I
should die, and not first in that thing discharge my conscience.

And so though I might write much, by what is written may appear to the meek
and sober minded, that the Lord did not only call, but also thrust me forth of
the world into his harvest, and this was of God, and the operation of his
powerful word which called me out of the world, and hundreds since by the word
of his power through me have been gathered out of the way of the world, and
received the earnest of the rest eternal, and many converted unto Cod, and woe
be unto them who openly oppose me in this the Lords work I now am in, which he
has thus called me unto, and let none think that I did wilfully neglect my
outward employment; neither let any one think that I left my family as not
regarding them, nor that I stay much out of that country for any by end, for
the words are true, a Prophet is not without honor, save in his own country
and in his own house, and those that did since seek to stop my mouth, did not
well.

Concerning my public preaching, and something of what followed.
That none may stumble thereat, and say we called Quakers are such, who change
from one thing to another, and so what we hold, nor to be regarded, but I say
those that have no changes, are not come into the fear of God. Psalm. 55.19. and
the fear of the Lord is to depart from evil. and they that departs from evil
are become a prey, but such were cleansed and changed from glory to glory, 2
Cor. 3.18. and grew in grace and knowledge in the Lord Jesus Christ, and what I
did or said then, was in a great zeal and real intent to do good, neither did I
covet men's silver for it, neither was it my end to make a gain thereby though
much was freely offered me more then I intend to make mention, though I
received it not, so that therein I was not much found in covetousness; but when
judgment came upon me as before mentioned, I gave up that preaching and said at
the last meeting I had then, which was at Stoke-bliss, that my mouth was stopped
at that present, but if ever the Lord should open my mouth again I should
preach indeed, and it is so, praises to the Lord for ever, who has indeed
opened my mouth, and since I was no longer rebellious, and the living truth of
Jesus Christ do I declare and bear testimony to his name where ever I come as
his spirit moves me.

And let none hereby think that I now glory in what was then my shame, for
though I had a great zeal then for God, it being not according to knowledge on
the Cross of Christ which crucifies to the world, and all its vain customs;
the which cross being then left behind, which is the power of God, so the love
of the world which is enmity to God remained in me and the root of iniquity not
then removed out of my heart, therefore fruits of disobedience in secret were
still brought forth, which the world took little notice of, but I had one near
me, which did let me see all that ever I did, and reproved me for vain glory,
and having the praise of men and the love of the world, and so my preaching did
not bring souls home to God, though I informed their minds of many things
which many ignorant people knevv not before, and so though much love was in
many, yet this brought not forth fruits of obedience unto God, and so all came
to little; for the people remained in their sins and received not power to come
out of it, neither came they out of the fashions and customs of the world, not
to be separated from the unclean, neith^r did they come to the faith of our
Lord Jesus Christ, which purifies the heart stands in the pure conscience and
respects no man's person, for unto that I was not then come my self, and so
their faith and mind was vain being then in our sins.

Therefore let none think that I now justify any deceit, hypocrisy, or secret
evil, that then was in me, or practiced by me, for in the presence of the Lord
God, I do openly declare against it all, and that spirit that acted me therein,
(but I own that simple thing, which then encouraged me to do good, out of an
honest intent, and that kept me out of covetousness, and from receiving of
gifts.) And I openly declare against all cruel, unj^st and ungodly actions and
words, and all that filth which I wallowed in, before I was a zealous
professor, as it is known to many ungodly persons, how I was once as wicked as
many of them, whom I warn all to repent, otherwise they cannot escape the
damnation of Hell.

And I utterly deny and declare against that blindness and hypocrisy I was in,
when I followed the Chief Priest from one Idols Temple to another, who were
chief in the Serpents wisdom, deceiving me and many more, and taught me that
knowledge which came from the Devil, who said, Ye shall be as gods, knowing,
Genesis 3.5. And in that knowledge, (in which every man is brutish, Jer. 10.14.)
from them hirelings I increased, which puffs up, and increased my sorrow, as
before was mentioned; for by that Serpents subtilty, which I learned from them
without me, I fought against, and resisted that which was holy in me: Therefore
I declare in the Name of the Lord God, that all the hireling Priests do more
harm than good, and shall never bring people to receive the power of God, but
lead them into subtilty, and further off from the knowledge of that of God in
them, Romans 1.19. And as true as the Lord God lives, upon their deathbeds
shall both Priests and people witness this to be true: And its also as true,
that I write this without any prejudice to any of their persons, but in love to
all peoples souls do I warn all them hireling Priests in Herefordshire and
elsewhere, to leave deceiving the people, for absolutely the people are
deceived by them, and forced to maintain them too, who may be warned of them by
what I have learned by experience from them, having tried them and their ways
to the utmost, and have much experience of them more then many country people
whose souls I truly love, and therefore this I write.

And I declare against that which ruled in me in the time of ignorance and
perverseness, and acted me in cruelty or oppression toward any person* or to
wrong, defraud, or insult over any one in tyranny, either by word or action, or
wherein I abused or smote with envy (which is of the Devil) Either man or
Beast, and that whereby I was led into any manner of hypocrisy or
double-mindedness, or any manner of evil whatsoever which was unjust in the
sight of God, though not seen by man: or any secret evil that then lodged in
the dark corners of the stony heart then in me, whereby any thing did arise in
me or proceed from me which was contrary to the humble, meek, innocent, upright
life of the Lamb of God, who is now come and has taken away the sin of the
world, and is pure, humble, meek, and lowly, whose life and power of love
constrains me to declare openly against all that which was done or said by
me in envy, either openly or secretly against any creature, for there is
nothing done in secret, that shall not be made manifest.

And let all who knew me before (who are saying I was an honest man be warned
of the like evil, and leave it, considering, that if the righteous scarcely be
saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear, for many did look upon me, to
be either a godly or an honest man, yet am I made willing to let open shame
come upon all that, which then was in me contrary to the Righteousness of
God, for he alone is to be exalted, and the transgressor is to be ashamed,
Psalm. 25.3. And every mouth shall be stopped, and every one stand guilty before
God, and the shame and nakedness of all, both Priests, and Fathers and People,
shall appear as much as mine, when Gods vvitness in them arise, though they
cover it for a time by deceitful flateries, promising liberty, but are as
deeply the servants of corruption as I was.

And I do affirm in the presence of the Lord God, that there are a generation
of professors who follow Sermons, and have gathered themselves into outward
Forms, who are grown up into a profession, and knowledge in the Letter, who
are further off the Life of God than the Publicans and Harlots, and are grown
into pride, hypocrisy, secret deceit, arrogance and covetousness; and some of
them for a time denied the Priests, and then for their own ends, got into their
places, and so are more abominable than they, and the tree of Knowledge they
feed upon, but the good savor of pure obedience unto God, in all self-denial,
they have cast beh^nde their backs, and are become an ill savor among all men;
and the Lord God will visit them for these things, and in the Day of his
fierce Wrath will all such want a hiding place; and when the day of howling
and astonishment come upon them, as it has passed upon me, then shall they
know that the sinners in Sion shall be afraid, and horrible fearfulness shall
surprise the hearts of the hypocrites, and then shall they find that God will
not be mocked, though they deceive themselves with vain hopes, which shall
perish with all such professors if they repent not and strip themselves bare
from all their false coverings, which in the day of the Lord (which ^hey put
afar often) will certainly be all too narrovv: For, because of the greatness of
my profession, without the power that overcomes all sin; therefore was the
Wrath of God the more upon me, and I never came to receive pardon for sin, nor
power over it, nor to receive the life of the Son of God, until his judgments
had confounded all that Wisdom, which I h^d lea^ned from and among the P^iests
and professors. And this is absolutely true, and may be a warning unto all them.

And all that is herein declared, of the Strivings in me, and judgments of God
which came upon me, is very short of what it was, Neither indeed, can it be
ever declared, being then confounded both within and without: not having any
man to be a director unto me, nor then to guide me in Go is wisdom, neither
did any man bring me into that condition, nor lead me through it, but even the
Lord alone in whose judgments I now rejoice for evermore; but this especially,
would I have all people that then knew me to consider, that at that time, (when
I was in distress,) I knew not well what I should do or speak, among men,
neither what I should be, being become a fool for Christ's sake, and my wisdom
being confounded, and my understanding brought to nothing, Read, 1 Cor. 1.1.9.
verse. 27.

And so that was true, which I writ in that book in Answer to Edmond Skip,
wherein I said that we were but in measure leaving of the world, and entering
into a little of that which is Eternal, at which time before mentioned, I was
brought to be silent from my public preaching, and waited on the Lord, with a
few foolish contemptible ones in the eyes of the world, at which time having
lost my earthly wisdom, and not received that measure of the pure wisdom of
God, (which since he has given me) whereby to order all my words and actions,
in prudency and moderation, before the eyes of all people, and others also
might then with me therein fall short, whereby some to this day may stumble at
the whole truth of God, looking at what happened among us, in that time, when
the judgments of God was often on us, (by which judgment, his Sion is now
Redeemed, and so they looking at that, and vvatch ever since for evil may be
kept thereby from receiving the precious tried Stone, which the wise Master
builders also refuse, though we now know, he is laid in Sion (redeemed with
judgment, for a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to both the
houses of Israel; But let all take heed, of stumbling at the stumbling stone,
(the light of Christ,) for other causes of stumblings, Especially by me, I have
hereby endeavored to remove out of the way, (and minds) of all that are
willing to receive the Truth, or believe in the Light. John 12.36.

And as for Edmond Skipp, if ever he come again to that, which convinced him
of evil, and made him in public deny his preaching for hire and tithes, though
after he started aside, and stumbled in the dark, before the Light of life*
(which once he honestly desired after) was sprung up in him, to which light if
he return, and love the witness of God in him; which has ever since stood a
witness for me, and have let him see his barrenness, and without a true
eternal rest, and if he to that be obedient which is manifest of God in him,
and by it, be led into meekness, and plainness, without prejudice, he may
come to receive the living Truth of Jesus Christ, for which this day I suffer
bonds, for I did never yet look upon him, to be so utterly reprobate, as not
possible to receive the faith that purifies the heart and respects no man's
person, for truly my love has been to the seed oppressed in him, though that
which has exercised him in rashness, (against the truth of God) I do deny for
ever, and there is neither him, nor any Priest, Preacher, professor, or
profane, that can have any good ground or reason to envy me for declaring
openly against all that in them which I declare against in my self, when it
ruled in me, when I was as they yet are.

I being by several long unjust Imprisonments detained from liberty, to
declare in words those and other things, therefore for this very end, have I
written this in short, that Gods truth might stand clear, and not suffer in any
thing done or said by me, before Gods pure wisdom was born up in me, and that
also the ground of all other things against the truth (if occasioned by me) may
be removed out of the minds of all that are willing to receive the truth if
they knew it, for I would not if possible, that any thing whatsoever which
concerned me, should so remain in the mind of any one, as that thereby he
should be hindered from receiving the living truth, which I have found so
precious, without which none can be saved; and if by the appearing of the shame
of my former nakedness an inlet for the truth may be made into the minds and
hearts of any, therein will be my joy and the eternal comfort of all them, who
by receiving, and sanctification of the truth, and faithfulness in the light,
do come to rest in the kingdom of joy, and eternal peace for ever and ever.

Thus at present, in tender love, to the souls of you Rulers and Professors in
Herefordshire, to whom I say, believe in the Light, and mind Gods witness in
you, and be not rigid, bitter, nor persecutors of the children of Light, who by
them in the dark, are called Quakers, among whom I have chosen to suffer
reproaches, for Christ's sake, and whippings, long imprisonments, and dungeon,
and now in the house of correction, all which declares me to be as you may
read, 2 Cor. 6.3. to the 11. Who am a friend to the souls of all mankind, a
servant of Jesus Christ, not by the will of men, to whom I am known, by the
name,

Humphry Smith:
Written upon the 18th. and 19th. days of the 6th. Month 58. being in outward
bonds at Winchester.
Concerning the Sons of God, and the Daughters of Men.
Were it not the sons of God, that looked upon the beauty of the daughters of
men, and so took them to Wife, because they were fair? And was it not even
then, when that the Lord said, My Spirit shall not always strive? And is it not
just for the Spirit to cease striving, when way is given to the eye, to go
forth from beholding the glory of God within, to look at the fairness of the
daughters of men without, and also to take that into the heart, and be married
to that? And was it not suddenly after this, that the Lord resolved to bring
the flood upon them and their Wives? And were not these suddenly overwhelmed in
the deep Waters, who were before called the sons of God? And did not they sink
in the deep under Gods wrath, and perish with the profane, who before had felt
the strivings of his Spirit, which being loved, obeyed, and kept in, makes
sons, and are not the sons to keep faithful to the Maker, themselves to be the
Spouse of Christ, who redeems out of the lust, and so to know the Maker to be
the husband, and they as chaste wise Virgins feeling the oil.

And were it not those that stood before the Throne in white (then not among
the world in filth) who had not only washed their Robes in the blood of the
Lamb, but also kept themselves from being defiled with Women? and did not that
which beheld the fair daughters of men, let in that which defiled the sons of
God, and so grieved his Spirit* and was not her firstborn a Murderer, who
looked out at, and so let in that, which was fair, pleasant and desirable to
that eye? and did not she (who was deceived by that which was fair without) say
of her firstborn, I have gotten a man from the Lord? (it was from the Spirit)
and was not he a Vagabond in the earth, from the presence of God, that she from
the Lord had gotten? and are not they from the Lord, who are marrying and given
in marriage, now the Son of Man (who is the Bridegroom) is coming to be
revealed, with power and great glory, in his people that waited for him? and
are not those also to be swept away as they were, who thus before the flood
caused the Spirit of God to cease striving? And did not Christ say, it should
be so at his coming, as in the days of Noah, eating and drinking, marrying,
and giving in marriage? and is it not so? Have not some even felt his coming
near unto them; and yet not keep in the fear until he was come, and revealed in
power, through the death of that, which had power over him; from whence that
went forth, which in the mind conceived a desire to the other glory, and so
let that in, which then took place in the heart, in stead of the glory of God,
who will not give his glory to another?

But do I forbid marriage? nay: Marriage is honorable; but that which makes
honorable, keeps out that which does defile; and that which makes
honorable, is Humility, walking with God, and is to go before, and keeps to
God, and they that are joined to him are one Spirit; but that which leads
from that which makes honorable, is out of the marriage, in that which does
defile, and such God will judge, and co^^^mn them by his witness in them, for
should not man first seek the Kingdom, and come into the dominion?

Did not Adam know his Wife, and beget that in his own likeness, which
murthe^ed the Righteous? and yet did not Enoch walk with God, and beget sons
and daugh^ers? but this becomes hid from them, who follow that which leads from
the thing, which was to join them to God, to follow that which looks at the
fair daughters of men, and so take them to Wife, and be married to that, and
know that as the first Adam did, who are his sons in his likeness, to whom I
say, (who after the manner of men have a Wife) that of late years they who are
married are as if they were not, the Resurrection, and the Life being come, and
the things of this world passes away: But woe to them, from whom that passes
away which is not of the world, which once from God they had received and
strived with, and in them who were once enlightened, and tasted of the heavenly
gift, who may consider, that those who had Wives were not to come at them,
(that they might be sanctified) before they came near to hear the voice of the
Lord, and the voice of the mighty thunderings was it that said, The marriage of
the Lamb is come. And Paul spoke a great Mystery concerning Christ and his
Church.

H. S.

And this thing I desire of you in Herefordshire, when you have read this Book,
to let any other people have it to read: And such as desire more, may speak to
Henry Bedford for them.

THE END.
