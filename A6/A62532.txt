General MONKS Welcome (From the CITY) to WHITEHALL.
To the Tune of, When the KING enjoys his Own again.
ALL ye Heroes of the Land,
That desire for to know,
How the cause does with us stand,
Now our gates are laid so low,
The truth of it is,
His Lordship we miss,
Yet for him we will always pray.
He Is gone unto Whitehall,
The Members to install,
And to get for us all a jovial day.
Had you but seen when as he came
To enter at his Palace Gate,
How many thousands raised his name,
And said he was St. George the great,
Welcome they cried,
As if a new bride*
^
His Lordship with the Mace,
And in truth he had good reason fort.
Protectors you do know we had,
And learned Councils they did keep,
Yet they never made our hearts so glad,
But ost times caused us for to weep:
But this noble Lord
Does comfort afford,
To Pesant and Nobilitte;
We Will celebrate his name,
The World shall sound his fame,
For he is the son of honesty.
When we were ready for to fall
To utter ruin, he came in,
And by his goodness saved us all,
And has accomplished the thing
Which we so long agone,
By all means would 'ave done,
Which was to have our Members in,
That in last forty eight
Were put unto slight
From the house where they had ought to have been.
'Twould joy ones heart to see his face,
He looks so like a Solomon,
Who has regained us in small space
From Styx to virtuous H^^^con,
We now do enjoy,
There Is none does annoy
Us, for we have our Represents
In the House of Advice,
Which can in a trice
Stycle our greatst incontinents.
Our noble Prince and all the rest,
Which have so long been absent there,
By's Excellence they are invest,
Though it be afrer many a year
Has been run past,
Yet now at the last,
^
That as ture as we drink,
That news performed the words of old:
Which was, a thousand from the North
Should come and reign in fifties place,
That the exiled Thistle should have growth;
And that the happy Rose should grace
The Thistle exiled,
Which so long by a wild,
By violence was kept from their right.
This our Monk he has done,
And their Title has won,
And brought them from the Land of night.
So to conclude, thrice welcome may
This English Champion welcome be,
And live to see the glorious day
Of friendship and of amity;
Let him long reign,
And his worthy Train
Enjoy the Freedom of the Land,
Jove bless this our George
From the Treacherous Forge
Of every base Sectarian.
G. Ticwhit.

FINIS.
