Mr. LOCK in his Thoughts of Education, page. 327. speaking of the usefulness
of Chronology, says,
THE most useful Book I have seen in that part of Learning is a Treatise of
Strauchius, which is Printed in 12o under the Title of Breviarium
Chronologicum, out of which may be selected all that is necessary to be taught
a Young Gentleman concerning Chronology.

TO THE READER.
Reader,
I Here present thee with the Translation of an Author who has never yet
appeared in an English Dress, one so famous for that sort of Learning he treats
of, that I thought it might prove no ungrateful Work to the Public to make him
speak our Language, which has already been so great a Stranger to Chronology,
the Subject which our Author here so learnedly handles. In it thou will find
that Accuracy, Method, and Exactness, that it may justly be esteemed the most
useful Book of this kind that has ever yet appeared abroad in the World, and
withal so fully written, that it contains all that is necessary to be taught a
young Gentleman concerning Chronology.

The Usefulness of this Study I cannot better recommend to thee, than in the
Words of the Ingenious and Learned Mr. Lock; who thus expresses himself upon
this Occasion in his Extraordinary Thoughts concerning Education: With
Geography (says he) Chronology ought to go Hand in Hand; I mean, the general
Part of it; so that he may have in his Mind a View of the whole Current of
Time, and the several considerable Epocha's that are made use of in History.
Without these two, History, which is the great Mistress of Prudence and Civil
Knowledge, and ought to be the proper Study of a young Gentleman, or Man of
Business in the World; without Geography and Chrenology, I say, History will be
very ill retained, and very little useful; but be only a Jumble of Matters of
Fact confusedly heaped together without Order or Instruction. It Is by these
that the Actions of Mankind are ranked into their proper Places of Times and
Countries; under which Circumstances they are not only much easier kept in the
Memory; but in that natural Order are only capable to afford those Observations
which make a Man the better and the abler for reading them. After this, he
extends his due Praises to our Author, as the best Chronologer he has met with
yet extant. But herein he only follows the Opinion of the Learned World, which
has always discovered a particular Value for this Piece; as may appear by the
several large Impressions that have been bought up since its first Publication;
And it is for this Reason I presume to set it in a clearer Light and more
public View; that so a Book of such General Use and Concernment may not any
longer be continued to a particular Set of Men: Upon which score I hope this
Translation may meet with an Acceptance and Entertainment suitable to the Worth
and Character of the Author.

As to the Translation it self, the Author's Method has been followed in every
thing, except in that tedious Way, he has made use of, by Question and Answer;
which breaking off so often the Thread of the Discourse, renders it less
pleasing to the Reader, and not more useful. This I have endeavored, and,
think may modestly say, I have amended, by turning the Author's Questions into
a Marginal Summary of the adjoining Section; and the Answer of it, which in the
Original is long and full of Quotations, into the Section it self; and these
agree generally the several Responses there; with which is to be hoped may be
more agreeable and easier retained by thee.

The Quotations, which are many in the Original, and much used by most German
Writers, I have only taken the Sense of, except such as are most material,
referring thee, if such is thy Curiosity, to the others in the Margin: And
where the Author is so prolix in Things of little Moment, and only shows his
Skill in confuting the Author of the Mystic Chronology, and others not of his
Opinion, I have thought fit rather to give thee the Sum of it than cumber thee
(as Mr. Lock calls it Page 328) with his Arguments at large.

And lastly, to make the Work as complete as I could, I have added several
Tables which are of great use for the more clear understanding the ensuing
Discourse, particularly that useful one of Mr. Flamstead's about the Equation
of Time.

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE Breviarium Chronologicum, Concerning the Nature and
Constitution of CHRONOLOGY.
DEFINITIONS.
1. Chronology is a Science wherein time (Quatenus, Quantum) is considered as
to its use in History. 2. Its Division is into General and Special. 3. The
General part is that which considers time in General, with its diverse
Denominations and Characters; and first of all it explains the Julian Period,
the common Receptacle of all Epocha's. 4. The special part is that which
considers time in particular, by demonstrating the certainty of Epocha's, and
taking a view of all the Calenders or Fasti of diverse Nations. 5. Therefore the
special part includes a review and computation of Epocha's.
. I. SPecial Chronology is a discipline distinct from other things; its true
indeed, few things can be known of time, its very definition being obscure,
according to what St. Aug. 14. Confess.
Austin says, Quid ergo est Tempus? Si nemo ex me quaerat, Scio; si quaerenti
explicare velim, Nescio; nor is De Invent.
Cicero less embarass'd in his thoughts upon it; Tempus, says he, est id quo
nunc utimur, etc. and because of these difficulties, many are for referring all
we know of time, to Astronomy; but, I think, erroneously, for wherever an
Instructive Object wholly peculiar is at hand and that entire, there is a
certain peculiar Discipline distinct from others, and such an Instructive
Object is Time, as the whole following discourse will evince.

. II. Besides Chronology has the conditions Chronology a Science.
requisite to entitle it to the name of a Science for there is a Scientifick
Object. and its affections or properties, as also Chronological characters
which supply the place of Causes, as if it were to be shown, that the year of
Christ 1664. was the 6377th year of the Julian Period, it might be done after
this manner; that year which has 21 for the character of the Solar Cycle, 12
for the Lunar, and 2 for the Cycle of Indiction, that is the 6377th year of the
Julian Period, but the 1664th year of Christ is such, Ergo, etc. and we shall
give the Demonstrations of the same in all the Epocha's, and though some err in
Chronology, it is the fault of the Artist, not of the Art.

. III. And some erroneously confound History with Chronology; for though a
Chronologer considers Chronology distinct from History.
time for the use of History, yet it is certain Chronology and History don't
coincide; for Chronology explains time it self, and declares how it comes to be
distinguished by such and such Characters. But History only reports things done
in time; we have no demonstrations of things done in History, but most certain
ones of things in Chronology; a Chronologer divides and characterizes time, an
Historian collects all passages he can to make his History complete, but we
deny not these Disciplines to be useful to each other, since the Historian
receives the Chronologers time noted by Characters, and the other his Actions
as Examples. Hence some say, History has two Eyes, Chronology and Geography,
which is not unlike what Prolegom. in Eusebius.
Scaliger says, Chronologia anima Historiae est, sine qua Historia non spirat,
quae quanto multit, tanto Chronologia illi praestat, ut corpori anima. Nor has
Petavius spoken unwisely. Ration. Temp. part 2. lib. 1. cap. 1.
Historia rerum praeteritarum est narratio. Chronologia vero rerum earundem
certis ex indiciis ad sua tempora temporumque parts accommodatio. Quare huic
illa materiam copiamque suppeditat, haec illi vicissim formam ac velut Regulam
adhibet, illa simplici rerum gestarum ordine contenta est; nec annorum
singulorum exactam rationem instituit: haec annos ipsos quoad licet, annorumque
parts, quibusdam notis ac vestigiis assequitur.

. IV. But Chronology and the Doctrine of times Difference of Chronology and
doctrine of times.
according to Petavius Proleg. op. Chronol. c. 3.
, seem to differ in this; Chronology says he, is an Art of assigning the Memory
of things past in their times, distinguished by proper Notes and Characters; but
the Doctrine of times is a Science which enquires the conditions and properties
of time as useful for Mankind; yet we can distinguish no difference between
'em, but Physical and Natural, for we see not how Petavius's Definitions agree
with his promise, who said, Se velle de natura hujus Scientiae disserere
secundum Philosophos maximeque Dialecticos.

. V. A Science is said to be Subalternate, not Chronology subalternate, or
contained in Astronomy.
only because in the Universality of an Object it acknowledges a Superior. In
which Sense all Mathematical Sciences are Subalternate to Physics; and as it
assumes a Subject contained in the subject of another Science, yet so as that
it may add some accidental difference to it, but also as it assumes the
Conclusions of some Subalternate Science in the room of Principles, which
conditions may be seen among the Schoolmen. Whereas therefore Chronology has
not only a Subject contained under the object of Astronomy, and superadds to it
some accidental difference, as a distinction into certain Periods, and such
contemplations as are useful to History, as also assumes many other principles
out of Astronomy, as that the Solar Tropical year is 365 d. 5 h. 49, that the
Lunar Month is 29 d. 12 h. 45. and others of like Sort, it may not unjustly be
said that Chronology is Subalternate to Astronomy, as Music to Arithmetic,
Optics to Geometry, etc.

. VI. And as in other Sciences the Explication A Chronologers Business.
of a Scientifick Subject is required, what principles of Being and Knowing,
what affections and kinds; so a Chronologer ought to take care that he explains
the nature of time according to these Heads; he must not confound Measure with
Measuring; whole Theories with Tables of Celestial Motions, are not to be
proposed by him who promises an Artificial and Scientific Method; in short, he
ought not to confound Heaven with Earth.

. VII. Certain characters of Times and Epocha's, are not to be admitted upon
the Authority Rule of Chronological Controversies.
of any Man, not Scaligers ipse dixit, whose Errors Petavius has distributed
into four Heads. The 1st Prophesying without any proof. The 2 d Collections
from places of the Ancients ill understood. 3 d False Reasonings. 4th Self
Contradictions, which we would not repeat to Scaliger's discredit; every
Artificer deserves some praise, though the Art may not be advantageously
handled.

. VIII. Matthew. Beroaldus, David Paraeus, etc.
Some have decry'd all Chronology, Sacred Writ no exact Chronology.
except what may be drawn from Sacred Writ; from whose sufficiency though we
would not detract, yet it is certain a perfect Chronology is not to be attained
this way; for the Bible leaves off at Cyrus, and begins again at Darius, which
interval must be determined from profane History. Hence Scaliger rightly, Actum
esset de Chronologia Sacra, si absque exoticis monumentis foret, quod cum
Sapientissimi Scriptores Tatianus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullianus,
Africanus, Eusebius, aliique animadvertissent omnino sine exotica Historia
intervalla sacra deprehendi posse desperarunt. Dicatur igitur tumidis Buccis,
elalo supercilio atrocem injuriam spiritui sancto fieri, si Historia Sacra ab
exotica subsidium petat. Quasi magna illa ignominia sit si Historia exotica
Sacrae ancilletur.

. IX. Yet there is a certain Author who as the Mystical Chronology of the N 7.
Creation of the World was performed in 7 days, is for concluding that the N.
7. carries in it great Mysteries, but since there is no reason either in Nature
or History for such Surmizes, we shall pass it by as a Dream of one that talked
at adventure. See Chronologus Mysticus in sole temp. p. 3. and alibi.

. X. But in Ancient times the Clerks who Of Ancient Chronologers.
were esteemed most Learned, had the business of Chronology commended to 'em by
the Magistrate; it was not only to the Alexandrian Bishop, that the Indiction
of Easter was committed in the Nicene Synod, but it was a most ancient
Institution. The Hierophantae amongst the Egyptians and Greeks, the Priests
among the Jews, the Chaldaean South-sayers amongst the Babylonians, the
Brachmanes amongst the Indians, the Pontifices amongst the Romans, the Druids
amongst the Gauls, etc. presided over the popular Calendars.

. XI. And although we are not willing with Scaliger Chronology a difficult
Science.
to frighten any one with this passage, Nemo nisi liberalibus disciplinis and
omnigenis Artibus initiatus accedat. Yet it is certain Chronology has some
difficulties before it is attained, because the Knowledge of all Sciences is
required, and it is even immersed in the Ocean of Mathematics and History.

. XII. The Division of Chronology into a General and Special part seems just,
both from Of the division of Chronology.
the condition of the Object to be known, which 1st appears to the Humane Mind
in general, afterward in particular; as also from the Analogy of other
Sciences; for whereas all Sciences may be divided into General and Special,
there seems a true reason why in delivering the Doctrine of Times, we should
not depart from this Method.

. XIII. The following Division is attributed According to others.
to Elias, not the Thisbite, but a more Modern Master of the Jews, Duo millia
inane, duo millia Lex, duo millia Messiah: Which Tradition is diverse ways, and
almost in every Interval erroneous. Lib. 12. contra Faustum.
Augustine divides it thus into six Ages: the First from Adam to Noah, the
Second from Noah to Abraham, the Third from Abraham to David, the Fourth from
David to the Babylonish Captivity, the Fifth from the Captivity to Christ, the
Sixth from the Coming of Christ to the End of the World, which the Seventh
shall receive, comprehending Eternal Life. And this Division is followed by
Beda and Isidore: According to others these Six Ages are expressed, as in the
following Verses:

Primus Adam, Justusque Noe, magnus Pater Abram,
Et posthaec Moses, David, Natusque Redemptor:
Septima fine caret, locat requieque beatos.
Breviarium Chronologicum. Of the Nature and Constitution of CHRONOLOGY.
BOOK I.
CHAP. I. Concerning some-Terms in Chronology, and those the most common, viz.
Minutes, Scruples and Moments.
1. A Minute is usually the least Part of time, which is commonly called a
Scruple. 2. A Scruple is one thing as it is taken in the usual and Mathematical
sense, and another as it is received in the Jewish. 3. The Vulgar and
Mathematical Scruple is the 60th part of an Hour, divisible into 60 other
Parts, and so on; whence they are called 1 2 3 4'''', etc. 4 A Jewish Scruple
is the 1080th part of an Hour, divided usually farther into Moments. 5. A
Jewish Moment is the 76th part of a Scruple.
. 1. FAbricius Paduanus In C^^en Temp. Annul. p. 35.
has observed that the ancient Chronologers divided the Hours into Points,
Moments, Vncias and Atoms: So that the Point was the 4th part of The Ancients
Division of in Hour.
an Hour, a Moment the 10th part of a Point, an Uncia the 12th part of a
Moment, and an Atome the 47th part of an Uncia; so that a whole Hour contains 4
Points, 40 Moments, 480 Uncia's, 22560 Atoms; but this Division is now grown
obsolete.

. 2. Yet Chronologers as well as Mathematicians, Mathematical Division,
do not only divide the Hours and its Parts, but also every Total, or any thing
that is like it, into 60 Scruples: For although the Division of the whole into
Points may be free, yet, to avoid the Trouble of computing which Fractions
cause, except the 10 (which is still better) a more fit than this cannot be
found out, especially if it be observed that those 60 Parts may be used as
Integers, as it may be more at large shown in Arithmetic.

. 3. But the Author of the New Moons The Jewish Division.
gives this account why the Jews divided the Hour into 1080 Scruples, viz. that
because there is no Number more easily divisible into so many Parts as is the
1080, being that it can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, etc.

. 4. And this the Jews, according to their Institution of it Divine.
wonted Superstition and Boastings of Revelations, will not have of any Humane
Invention, but assert it to be Divine. Concerning which, R. Samuel says,
Isachar ascended into Heaven, and brought from thence 1080 Parts.

. 5. Neither would they have this to have been By others used.
used by any others besides themselves, since that from Aben Ezra to the 12th
Chapter of Exodus these Portions are called the Parts of Israel, though very
falsely, Scaliger having observed Lib. 1. de Emend. Temp.
that both the Samaritans, Arabians and Persians, as well as other Eastern
Nations have made use of this Division as well as they.

. 6. However to reduce those Jewish Scruples How to reduce Mathematical to
Jewish Scruples.
to the Mathematical, and these again to the Jewish, you may say, If 60
Mathematical Scruples give 1080 Jewish, how many will the aforesaid
Mathematical Scruples give? And again, if 1080 Jewish Scruples be equal to 60
Mathematical Scruples, how many of them will be equal to the aforesaid Number
of these? And it will appear when the Operation is finished, that one
Mathematical Scruple contains 18 Jewish, and one Jewish 3 20 of the
Mathematical; and on this Accounts are the following Tables calculated.

. 7. Epiphanius reports, that diverse of the Marcosians (so called from one
Marcus a celebrated Wise Man who espoused the Valentinian Heresy) Of some that
divide the Hours otherwise.
divided the Hour into 30 Parts, which Division was not peculiar to them, but
comprehended the two Equinoctial Hours; whence undoubtedly it came to pass,
that whereas 30 Degrees were equal to that time, the Marcosians divided their
compounded Hour into so many Parts. So likewise the Inhabitants of Cataja
(which the Ancients called Serica) and the Subjects of the great Cham of
Tartary divide the Year into 24 equal Parts; so that every Part contains 15
Days and 2814 Particles, and ten thousand of these Particles (every one of
which they call a Fenack) answer to one Day amongst them; Of which more
hereafter.

CHAP. II. Concerning Hours.
1. An Hour is commonly called the 24th part of a Day. 2. There are two sorts
of Hours; some are called equal, others unequal. 3. Equal Hours, which the
Greeks call (...), are those in which the Night and Day are divided into 24
equal Parts. 4. Unequal Hours, which the Greeks call (...), are those wherein
the time of the natural Day is divided into 12 Parts, and the Night into as
many.
. 1. ALthough some will have the Word Hour in Latin, Hora, divided from the
Greek The Derivation ^f the Word Hour.
Word (...), which signifies to limit or bound; because it is the Measure of
time; yet the most common Opinion is, that its Original is owing to the
Egyptians; because Macrobius Saturn. l. 1. c. 21.
, and from him many others observe, that the Sun with them was called Horum; of
which Opinion Pausanias was also long since.

. 2. But the Word Hour has not always What it signified formerly.
been of the same signification; but in ancient times an Hour did indefinitely
express a short space of time; in which sense the LXX Interpreters have
sometimes translated it, and Vlpian in Athenaeus (not without Reason) doubts
whether it may be used as for a Definite, or set part of the Day in the
Writings of the Ancient Greeks. Certain it is in St. Luke (...), St Luke chapter
14. v. 17.
is used for Supper-time. Besides, Homer calls (...) the Coeli janitrices; to
which Ovid alludes, bringing in Janus.

Praesideo foribus coeli cum mitibus Horis.

Some believe that heretofore the four Seasons of the Year, wherein the Sun
finished its Course, had the Name of HOVRS, as ancient Writings do testify.
Others there are would have the Reason hereof to be, that because an Horus
instituted a certain three-monthly Year; therefore the Ancients called Spring,
Summer, Autumn and Winter Years; nay the Year it self Horus; of which thing
some Footsteps appear in this, that the Greek Annals called them their Hori,
and their Writers Horographici. And others there are also who in a particular
Acceptance of the Word, think that the Greeks call that Part of Time an Hour
wherein the Dog Star arises; whence Galen in his Book de Alimentis calls those
Horean Fruits which sprung up at that time wherein the Dog Star arose; and
Horace says,

Flagrantis atrox hora Caniculae, etc. Lib. 3. O. 13*


So that in general the Ancients by an Hour have signified an Age; by the 12th
Hour, Old Age, as in that Dialogue of M. Crassus, and the King of Galatia. What
mean you? says he, art not thou now arrived at the 12th Hour, and yet talkest
of building a new City?

. 3. Herodotus relates, Lib. 2.
that the Graecians Why the Ancients divided the Day into 12 Parts.
received from the Egyptians the Use of the Pole, the Gnomon, and the twelve
Parts of the Day: and Pierius Valerianus Hieroglyph. Lib. 6.
says, that the Original of that Use among the Egyptians was, because their
Priests were wont twelve times a Day to cry aloud with a howling Noise to their
Cynocephalus; and both Cicero and Marius Victorinus have taken notice of such a
Ceremony to Serapis.

Galen remarks other things of this Number, viz. that the Romans used it not
only for their Hours, but also in Weights, Measures, etc. as being a Number
divisible into many aliquot Parts.

. 4. And doubtless Astronomers according What Hours the Ancients had.
to the Motion of the Equator, have constituted equal Hours, yet it is
apparent that the Ancients used the unequal more than the equal Hours. St. John
says St. John c. 10. 9.
, are there not 12 Hours of the Day? which must be false, if Equinoctial: As
likewise St. Matthew Mat. 20.

300 Years after the Building of the City, by reason there is not any mention
made of 'em in the 12 Tables, as the other Laws after that time do; before
which the Divisions were only before and after Noon,

. 7. But amongst the many Instruments the The Ancients manner of noting the
Hours of the Day.
Ancients made use of to distinguish their Hours, the Sun-Dial or Heliotropia
is certainly the most ancient. For, in the Holy Scripture we read 2 King. 20.
of Ahaz's Dial, where that great Miracle was wrought of the Sun's going back
ten Degrees; about which not only R. Solomon, but other Interpreters agree that
those Degrees were the Indices of such parts of the Day: Nor do we believe that
this so public a Machine was only in use amongst Mathematicians, as Salmasius
fancies, against whom Dion. Petavius very well urges, that then it would not
be the Custom to erect them so publicly in the Marketplaces; and much more
from hence the Falsity of a contrary Opinion does appear, that the Use of
Fortune Tellers and Astrologers were very severely forbidden by the Jews.
However, the Use of Dials was not only long since known to the Jews but to
other Nations, as the Greeks, as Diogenes Laertius reports; and the Romans, as
Pliny D. L. Lib. 7. C. 60.
relates. Pomponius also gives an Account of a famous Dial in the Field of
Mars, which Persius speaks of when he says,

Stertimus indomitum quod despumare Falernum
Sufficiat quinta dum linea tangitur umbra.

so happy as to enjoy the Light of the Sun, the ancient Romans or rather the
Greeks, to make some amends for the frequency of Storms, etc. found out,
according to the Ingenuity of that Age, an artificial Invention. The Author, as
Pliny L. 7. C. 60.
writes, was Scipio Nasica; which Pancirollus gives the following Description
of; They took says he, a Vessel made of Glass, in the bottom of which was a
narrow Hole done about with Gold, lest the Water should wear it away. On the
other part of the Vessel was drawn a right Line, having the twelve Hours set
upon it; after which they filled the Vessel with Water which issued Drop by
Drop out of the little Hole; they thrust a Cork into the Water, fastened to a
little Wand, the end of which pointed at the 1st Hour, and as the Water fell
down more at the 2 d, 3 d, etc. Hours. This in the Greek was called a
Clepsydra, and with us an Hourglass.

unequal, since that there cannot be any difference of Hours Artificial and
Natural, as to the Quantity, with those that live under the middle of the
Torrid Zone, or under the Equator, where the Signs of the Zodiac ascend
directly: Yet is it otherwise with those that live under the Temperate Zone, if
the Sun be in the Equinoctial Points.

. 10. And it is commonly thought, that all the Hours of the Day, which they

are equal one with another; not considering, that the very Days from Noon to
Noon are unequal; and then their Parts can never be equal; but since the
Inequality is but little, a Mathematician ought to know it; but it is but of
little moment in ordinary Uses.

of the Natural Day, so is one equal Hour to the unequal Hour that answers it;
by this means the Proportion between equal and unequal Hours will be so well

Division of their several Hours of the Day for their ordinary Concerns,
Martial gives us the following Account of, viz.

Prima satulantes atque altera continet hora;
Exercet raucos tertia causidicos;
In quintam varios extendit Roma labores;
Sexta quies lapsis; septima finis erit;
Sufficit in nonam nitidis octava palaestris;
Imperat extructos frangere nona teres.
Hora libellorum decima est Eupheme meorum,
Temperat Ambrosias cum tua cura dapes.
Et bonus aethereo laxatur nectare Caesar
Ingentique tenet pocuia parca manu:
Tunc admit jocos gressu metire licenti,
Ad matutinum nostra Thalia Jovem.
But the Greeks used six Hours only for the dispatching their Affairs, spending
the rest in the Refreshment of the Body and Mind; whence these Verses,

Sex Horis tantum rebus tribuuntier agendis,
Vivere post illas littera zeta monet.
As also,

In sextam labor usque horam: namque inde notantur
Litterulis vitae commoda habere jubent.
CHAP. III. Of Vigils and Watches.
1. A Vigil is a certain space of Time, wherein the Natural Day and the
following Night was formerly divided into certain Parts, so called from the
changings of Sentinels or Watchmen. 2. There are two Vigils, one of the Day,
and the other of the Night. 3. Those of the Day, or rather Centries, Watch and
Wards, were most commonly four equal Parts of a Natural Day, each of which
contained three Hours. 4. And those of the Night, with some Nations were four
equal Parts of the Night, of the same Continuance with the former.
1. THE Ancient Division of the Night and The Ancient Division of the (...).
Day, were into Evening and Morning; of which the History of the Creation often
makes mention; and although the Lights were not created till the third Day, yet
the Motion of the first Light resembling the Sun that followed after, might
make a distinction of Evening and Morning.

. 2. The Name of Vigils or Watches arose The Names of the Vigil.
from the Watchmen changing their Posts every three Hours, lest they might
either fail, and be over-wearied for want of Sleep, or that too much time might
be given to the Enemy to execute their treacherous Practices against the City;
whence it is plain, that it had its first Rise from a Military Custom; and this
Flavius Vagetius (a) confirms, giving this Account of the same; namely, That
out of every Century four Horse, and as many Footmen were drawn forth to keep
the Watch, and that because it was difficult for the same to keep Guard all
Night: Therefore was it thought necessary to divide it into four Parts,
according to the Order described before: The Watch was set by Sound of Trumpet,
and called off by that of the Cornet: Besides which the Tribunes appointed some
of the chiefest to go about the Watch to see if any were remiss in, or left
their Posts.

. 3. But since we can find little about the Days Watches, we shall only speak
of those of ^. Jews (...).
the Night. Some think that the Jews divided the Night at least into three
Watches, the first of which began at Sunset, and lasted till Midnight; whence
in Job C. 4. v. 13.
it is called the Time when deep Sleep falls on Men. The second is supposed
to begin at Midnight, and end at the Cock-crow, where the third commences,
lasting until the Sun begins to rise. And indeed the Jews themselves do
frequently make mention of three Watches: For in their Thalmud De Re Mil. Lib.
3.
Book of Prayers and Thanksgivings) R. Isaac the Son of Samuel says, There are
three Watches of the Night, in every one of which the Holy and Blessed God
sits roaring like a Lion; and says, Woe unto you Children; for I have
devoured my House by reason of your Sins, and burnt my Temple, etc. and the
like you may find in R. Salom Ad Ex^d 14. Conf Jud. 7. 19.
: But in the time of the New Testament it is plain, that the Night was divided
into four Watches, a Custom probably introduced by the Romans; as in those
Places of Mat. 14. v. 25. Mark 6. v. 48. c. 13. v. 35. in which sense Suidas
interprets (...), calling it the fourth Part of the Night.

. 4. Some think that the Jews received this Received from the Romans.
Custom of dividing the Night into Watches, from the Romans, yet without much
Ground: For as much as mention is made of the Jew^sh Vigils before ever the
Name o^ Empire of the Romans was known to the Jews: But it cannot be denied but
that the Jews followed the Roman Custom when the Jewish Policy began to decline.

. 5. Yet the famous Scaliger L. 7. d^ Em. Tem. p. 637.
is of opinion Another sort of V^g^ls.
that the Jews as well as the Romans and Greeks divided their Night and Day
into four Parts, and called those Quarters the Vigils; the first of which (as
he says) was from Sunset to Midnight: The second also called the Middle, as
being betwixt the two Suns, viz. the Setting of the one, and Rising of the
other, was from Midnight to the Sunrise. After these was the Morning-Watch,
which began at Sunrise, and continued till Noon: The last continued from Noon
till Sunset.

. 6. But the Romans distinguished their Night How the Romans divided the (...).
and Day by various Names; some of which we find in the twelve Tables and
others elsewhere, the Beginning and End was Midnight; after followed the Night,
after this the Cock-crow, after this the Dead of the Night, after this before
Day, after this Daybreak, after this the Morning, after this the Forenoon,
then Noon; after this the Afternoon, then late; after this the Evening, then
Twilight; after this Candlelight, after that Bedtime, after that far in the
Night, then to Midnight, and so Midnight again.

. 7. However we are yet in the dark as to How they and the Greeks agreed in
this matter.
the Greeks agreeing with the Romans, although it is no doubt, but that in the
time of War the Romans divided their Night into four Parts; and some think,
that the Greeks imitated them herein; though many Places in ancient Writings seem
to contradict it: From which it appears, that the Greeks divided their Day and
Night rather into three than four Parts; as appears by Seneca in Thyeste, where
the Chorus is introduced thus: Quo terrarum, etc. And in Andromache thus:

Parts fere nox aima transierat duas, Sen. Trag.

Clarumque septem verterant stellae jugum, etc.
And the Scholiast very clearly on the 10th Iliad of Homer: For as the Poet
divided the Day into three Parts, viz. into Morning, Noon and Evening, so does
he the Night: (...): For he would have the Hom. Ili^d.
Night to consist of Three Vigils.

CHAP. IV. Of the Days.
1. A Day is that Space of time wherein the Sun in its rising and setting,
performs either an entire Course, or a certain Part of the Globe. 2. It is
commonly divided into Natural and Civil. 3. That Space of time is called the
Natural Day, which passes betwixt Sunrise and Sunset. 4. The Civil Day is
that which contains one Revolution of the Heavens, and so including also the
Night, distinct from the Natural Day, whence the Greeks call it (...). 5. Days
also are either Holy Days or not. 6. Holy Days are those wherein Business is
laid aside; which the Romans formerly called Nefasti. 7. And those are made
holy, either by Divine or Humane Authority. 8. Some People by Divine Right
observe Sundays and other Holy Days. 9. But many Nations by Humane Imposition
did heretofore vainly observe several Days, and do at this time; as may appear
in the ensuing Discourse, and the various ways of choosing them. 10. Those that
are not Holy Days, but Work-Days, are also called Fasti, being those wherein
the solemn Offices are not performed either to the true God, or the false Gods
of the Gentiles.
. 1. THose that call that Space of time a The reason of the Natural and Civil
Day.
Natural Day wherein the Sun is upon the Horizon, are chiefly moved thereto,
because Nature and not Art effects that Day, but those that would have it an
entire Revolution of the Sun, allege that Nature intends a perfect
Circulation, likewise (...) is called a civil Day, because that the Citizens
were wont to use it in dating their Contracts and other Civil Actions; and
again they call the Suns staying upon the Horizon an Artificial Day, since that
it is then convenient for Artificers to do their Work; and as some will add,
because the Differences of such days cannot be made, but by the Workmanship of
Almighty God, and may be understood by the use of an Artificial Sphere.

. 2. But an Artificial Day is not taken in the same Not the same with all
Authors.
Sense by all Authors, for what in Chronology we call a Natural Day, the same
the Astronomers usually term an Artificial, and what we call a Civil, they call
Natural.

. 3. The measure of the Civil Day (according to The measure of a Civil day.
Chronologers) and the Natural (according to Astronomers) is by the daily
Motion of the Sun round the Earth, or as Astronomers do otherwise speak, it is
an entire Revolution of the Equator, with so much over as answers to the
Suns own Motion, receding in the mean time on the Ecliptic, whence the
Complements are unequal. The mean ones are 59. 8. in time 3. 57, by which part
of time the Solar days exceed the day of the Primum Mobile.

. 4. The difference of a Natural day from The difference (...).
the Civil, consists in their equality and inequality, some calling those
that are unequal Natural days, and those that are equal Civil, though very
absurdly; for those that dwell under the Equator, have all Natural days equal,
and if we should speak truly, Civil days are not equal, by reason of the
inequality of what is added; so if a Country just under the Pole was habitable,
its Inhabitants would have their Natural day neither equal nor unequal; for it
is called equal or unequal, in respect of each other; however they would know
no other day till the year was past. Yet it is true in an Oblique Sphere, for
its Inhabitants would have their Natural days unequal, whence Ovid when he
would describe an impossibility, says,

Longa dies citior brumali tempore, noxque Lib. de P^nto 2.

Tardior hyberna solstitialis erit.
And heretofore also Boethius.

Tu Frondifluae frigore brumae,
Stringis lucem breviore rota.
Tu cum fervida venerit aestas,
Agiles noctis dividis horas.
. 5. Yet all Civil days are equal and precisely All Civil days precisely 24
hours.
24 hours, for in that time an entire Revolution of the Equator from rising to
setting is performed; but because the Sun like other Stars whilst it turns
round so quickly upon the Equator, hastens toward its rise, performing its
mean daily course in 59. 8. but the space is unequal and hence the former
degree of the Ecliptic, together with a degree of the Equator being come to
the Meridian, the Sun wants some little space; to complete which, a little part
of time should be added, besides 24 hours which by reason of the Suns apparent
unequal Motion, will be unequal as above, but this is fully rectified by the
Famous Astronomer Mr. Flamsted, in his Calculation of the following Table of
Aequation of Time. viz.

. 6. That the Distinction of the Day into The Ancient Distinction between Civil
and Natural days.
Natural and Civil is very ancient, plainly appears by that Stratagem the
Thracians formerly made use of, which as Strabo relates Lib. 9. p. 277.
was thus. Ephorus says he, Writes that the Thracians making Truce with the
Boetians (so that then they might have less regard to their Camps) fell upon
'em by Night and destroyed them, whereby they broke the Truce; but the
Thracians denied they did any such thing, since that the Truce was made for the
days, and they fell upon them by Night; whence is the Proverb, Thracicum
Commentum: The like Story Plutarch relates in's Laconick Apophthegms.

. 7. The Variety of several Nations in their Of the various beginnings of days.
fixing the beginning of their days is very great, as well as that of their
Months and Years; but as to several of the Ancients this following Memorable
Distich, gives some small account of, viz.

Atticus occasum spectat Babylonius ortum
Nox media Ausonii, media at Lux perplacet Vmbris.
. 8. Those People indeed that have computed Those that begin their day from
Sunset.
their days from Sunset, are such as have observed the course of the Moon; for
in that time the Rule of the Lunar Seasons appear in the Starry Orb, this they
may perhaps have preferred to all others in imitation of Moses, which there is
no question but by the Jews, Arabians Athenians, and other Eastern Countries as
well as in Africa, was made use of.

. 9. And this also was used by the Babylonians, From Sun-r^se.
Chaldaeans, Syrians and Persians, whom Dionysius Petavius, L. 7. de Doct.
Temp. p. 609.
Ptolomaeus and Hypparchus following, accounted their beginning of their day
from Sunrise.

. 10. But the Custom of Calculating the From Midnight.
days from Midnight, is chiefly ascribed to the Ausonians, the most Ancient
Inhabitants of Italy, with whom it is very well known the Romans did agree for
many years; and probably this may be the reason of its Institution, because
that from that time wherein the Sun has traversed the lower part of the
Meridian, it will then begin to rise again; so that there might be a sort of
Harmony betwixt the beginning of the year and day, for of this Ovid thus speaks.

Principium capiunt Phoebus and annus idem.

Plutarch brings other Reasons besides this in his Problems, which may be seen
in Varro, and from him in Noct. A^^. Lib. 3. c. 2.
Aulus Gellius.

. 11. And the Vmbrians (a People well known From No^^^ide.
in Italy) near the Appennine Mountains and the Adriatic Sea, whom the Greeks
supposed only to have survived the General Inundation; whence their Name (...),
or showery (as Pliny Plin. l. ^. c. 14.
and Solinus Cap. 8.
would have their Original) usually accounted their Day from Noon; with whom
the Hetruscians the Borderers on the aforesaid Appennine Mountains, do agree.
And because the Meridian is a fixed immovable Circle (and easy for
Observations) the Mathematicians have followed this Custom two several Ways;
some beginning their Days slower by 12 Hours, and others sooner by the said
time, than the Civil; of the former sort were Tycho Braye and his Followers; of
the latter, Alphonsus and his Disciples.

. 12. But many Authors of good Account How by the Egyptians.
disagree concerning the Egyptians. Alexander ab Alexandro Geneal. Dier. Lib.
4. l. 20.
says, that the Egyptians and Athenians began their Day at Sunset, which
lasted to the same time next Day. Others there are, who have given out that the
Egyptians together with the Chaldaeans began their Day from Noon-^^de, whom
Christmannus upon Alfraganus follows. Pliny L. 2. 77.
says that the Egyptians computed their Civil Day from Midnight to Midnight.
Nor are there wanting Arguments that will prove them to have begun their Day
from Noon; which way Ptolemy frequently follows: But Salmasius, considering
those Difficulties, makes use of this unheard of Solution: For he supposes
Exercit Plin. p. 552.
the Egyptians not to have had Unequal Years, but Equal; and yet the Year
consisted of 365 Days and a Quarter; which fourth Part or six Hours he supposes
to be added every Year; whence it happened, that if the first Year began at
Midnight, the next began six Hours later, or in the Morning, the third at
Midday, and the fourth at Sunset: So that the first Day of every Year had not
a certain, but fourfold Beginning in respect of the Hour. But since this
Opinion seems contrary to all other Authors, it is not to be relied on: And we
shall still retain the same Opinion, that the Egyptians, at least some of 'em,
began their vulgar Year at Sunrise.

but little to differ from the Jewish Custom about this matter, since these
People observe the Moon in their Affairs, which Tacitus takes notice of, when
writing of the Germans: They assemble (says he) on certain Days, either upon a
New or Full Moon, unless any thing accidental or unexpected falls out. And it
is probable that those Days began from Sunsetting, according to the Custom of
other People which observed the Moon's Motion; as Tacitus farther confirms; For
transacting Business, they believe this Juncture of Time the most auspicious:
Neither, do they reckon by Days as we do, but by Nights; and they so order and
appoint things, as if the Night seemed to usher in the Day. And Caesar writes
almost the same thing of the Gauls. This Custom the English observe to this
Day, which our Sennight, derived from Seven Night, and Fortnight from Fourteen
Nights, does confirm. But in Bohemia and Borders of Poland the ancient German
Custom is observed, where the Day is from Sunset to the same time next Day; so
that the Clock at Sunset may be heard 24 times.

beginning at Noon, if you substract from the Jewish 18 Hours, (for so many
Hours the Jewish Computation anticipates the Mathematical, both in their
Ecclesiastical and Civil Affairs;) a whole Day being added, if without it no
Substraction can be made, the Remainder will show the time sought. But if our
Political Time, beginning from Midnight, was to be compared with the
Mathematical, there will be no need of Reduction, if in the Afternoon: But if
in the Morning, add 12 to the given Hour, and substract 1 from the Number of
Days, the Sum or Difference is the Mathematical time sought.

CHAP. V. Of Months.
1. A Month is that part of Time wherein we usually divide a Year into 12, and
sometimes into 13 Parts. 2. Months are either Astronomical or Civil. 3.
Astronomical are those that depend on the motion of the Stars. 4. And because
we generally have respect to the Luminaries in ordering of 'em, some we call
Lunar and others Solar. 5. A Lunar Month is that Space of time which is spent
in the Revolution of the Moon through its proper Orb; or from a Synod to a
Synod; and from the Appearance of the Moon after one Synod, to its Appearance
again after another. 6. Hence Nature seems to produce a threefold Lunar Month,
that is, a Synodical, Periodical and Month of Illumination. 7. The Lunar
Periodical Month is that Space of time in which the Moon by her Motion
returns to the same Place of the Zodiac whence she departed. 8. The
Synodical is that Space of time from one Conjunction of the Luminaries till the
next Conjunction following. 9. The Month of Illumination is that Space of time
intercepted betwixt the first Day, whereon the Moon is seen after her
Conjunction with the Sun, and the last Day of her being visible. 10. The Solar
Month is that Space of time wherein the Sun runs through one of the twelve
Signs of the Zodiac in its proper Motion. 11. A Civil Month is a System of
Days which different Nations differently observe in their Civil Affairs, as it
best pleases them.

from the Courses of the Moon, since they make Spaces which the German Word
Monat and our Word Month, both derived from the Moon, do likewise denote.

. 2. From which it appears that the Hebrews, The Ancient Form of Months.
Greeks, Latins, and Germans observed the Course of the Moon: For although
Arguments deduced from Etymologies of Words are but of little force; yet they
are strengthened if joined with other Proofs, especially if we take notice of
the extraordinary Aptness of the Hebrew Language and its Harmonical Communion
with those others mentioned before: whence Julian in that Hymn dedicated to the
King of Kings, says, That all the Months with all other Mortals are numbered
from the Moon, save we only and the Egyptians, who compute our Days of the
Year by the Motion of the Sun. Neither was the Lunar Month unknown long since
to the Romans, though the Apostate excepts them, since that the true time in
respect of Parturition; which with them was ten Months, seems to be the same
with these: In which Sense these Lines of Ovid are to be understood:

Annus erat decimum cum Luna receperat Orbem,
Hic numerus magno tunc in honor fuit.
Seu quia tot digiti, per quos numerare solemus,
Seu quia bis quino foemina mense parit.
. 3. As to the Mystic Months, consisting of 49 or 7 times 7 Days; although
there can be Of Mystic Months.
no Nation so barbarous as wholly to lay aside all Analogy with the Motion of
the Heavenly Bodies, in appointing their Times; yet the Author of this Mystic
Chronology spares not to lay it on the Jews themselves; and though these are
foolishly asserted or rather foolishly feigned; yet is this Opinion maintained
with great Absurdities: For nothing can be so unreasonable, as that God, who
created the Luminaries for set-times, Years and Months, should teach a People
peculiar to himself any other thing. Neither is the forementioned Word (...)
derived from the Moon, of so late a Date. Beside, who knows not that the Jews
in the chief Feast of their Passover observe the Moon, and always celebrate the
Feast on the Full Moon, and that on the 15th Day of the first Month. But
suppose the Jews had their Mystical Month consisting of 49 Days; yet this
Number of Days have no Agreeableness with the Lunar Motion: So that instead of
Full Moon, you will have nothing but mere Darkness. Nor do the Writers of the
Old Testament oppose this Truth, who doubtless were sacred and holy Persons;
and these speaking of Sacred and Divine things, have made mention of the 8th
and other Months beyond the 7th: So that if only this must be thought a Mystery
by reason of the Number 7, contrary to the Sentiments and Opinions of all Men;
why did not this Mystery-Expounder likewise surmise the same thing of a Day of
7 Hours, and of Hours of 7 Minutes, and so further on?

. 4. We here again mention the Periodical Of a Periodical Month.
Month, lest due Consideration should be wanting as to its Use; whence Kepler
calls the Periodical Month the Physicians Critical Month; as to the Quantity
of which, it is indeed unequal, and can be found no otherwise than by
Astronomical Calculation, by which it will appear that its mean Motion is
performed in 27 Days, 7 Hours, 43 Minutes, 5 Seconds.

. 5. The difference between a Periodical and The difference of a Periodical and
Synodical.
a Synodical Month, is, because the first is called Periodical only in respect
of the Moon's Orbit, but Synodical in respect of its Conjunction with the other
Luminaries. And because the Sun from the time of its Conjunction does not
continue in the same Place of the Zodiac, but moves forwards toward the East,
it causes, that the Moon finishing its Course does not find the Sun again in
the same Point it left him; but is removed almost a whole Sign from its former
Place; and that it might overtake the Sun again, it plainly appears that a
certain Space of time is requisite, besides the Periodical, to make up the
Synodical Month.

. 6. But as to the true Quantity of the Synodical Of a Synodical Month.
Month, we are to gather it from Astronomers, who study its Motion; as
Chronologers the Time in which the Motion is made; however, since a Synodical
Month is apparently unequal, we shall content our selves with the enumerating
from several Authors the mean Motion, as they call it; of which Tycho Brale's
we take to be the most Genuine: They are these;

d. h. 1 Cleostratus 29 12 00 00 00 00 00 00 2 Harpalus, 29 12 50 54 33 00 00

00 10 Tycho Brahe, 29 12 44 03 09 00

. 7. The Quantity of a Synodical Month is not the same at all times; for in the
Summer Synodical net always the same.
Solstice^ when the Sun seems to move slowest the Synodic Month appears less,
being about 29 Days, 6 Hours, and 42 Minutes: But in the Winter, when the Sun's
Motion seems faster, the Moon follows the Sun in a slower Space; for which
reason the Synodical Month then seems greater, viz. 29 Days 19 Hours, and 37
Minutes, as some Astrologers do observe. So that what has been said in the
preceding Section about a Synodical Month, is to be understood as to the mean
from which the true differs sometimes 14 Hours; and so is either greater or
less.

consist of Of the Months Pleni and Cavi.
31 Days, the Cavi of 30; and these two in the Lunar Year or Lunae-Solar, are
placed alternately, by reason of the Dependence of the 12 Hours, which, if
omitted in one Month, and doubled in another, make 24: For which reason they
can be no longer neglected, but are to be completed by the 30th Day, over and
above the 29th.

reckon their Month from the first Phasis, and observe no more in their Lunar
Year, than that one New Moon come before another; and that lest the Mirth of
the Calends, which with them were solemn and sacred, because of the Eclipse or
Suffering of the Sun, which might then happen, might be turned into Sadness:
For which reason the Turks upon their Towers and Turbats always place a
Crescent or Half Moon. And this some have asserted about the Ancient Jews; yet
is not the Assertion approved of by all Chronologers; others supposing that the
Jews most commonly made use of a Lunar Calculation, and at the same time to
have attended only the Observation of the Phasis, not from thence that they
might foretell the New Moon, but that they might sanctify it, and receive the
first Sight of the same, with this Prayer, Be thou a good Omen to us and to all
Israel! As also that they might examine the Exactness of their Tables, and from
them the Calculation sought for.

great Inequality in it; because the Sun in Cancer seems to us to move slower;
for which reason the Month of the Summer Solstice contains near 31 Days, 11
Hours and 36 Minutes; but in Capricorn, where the Motion of the Sun appears
more swift, Astronomers account the Months of the Winter Solstice only to
consist of 29 Days, 8 Hours and 54 Minutes, the mean Quantity therefore of
every Solar Month will be 30 Days, 10 Hours and 15 Minutes, that is as long as
the Sun is in the Equinoctial Signs.

threefold, either altogether uncertain, having no regard to the Lunar or Solar
Motions, as those of the Egyptians in the Equal Year, of the Romans in the
Year of Romulus, etc. or coming pretty near to the Solar Astronomical Months as
the Julian, or the Lunar Astronomical, as the Jewish, Turkish, and others.

CHAP. VI. Of Years.
1. Year is a certain space of time, whose parts are commonly called Months. 2.
And it is either Astronomical or Civil. 3. The Astronomical Year so called, is
that whose quantity is so determined by the motion of the Heavenly Bodies, as
neither the appendant Hours nor Minutes are omitted therein. 4. And because it
has peculiar respect to the Luminaries it is twofold, Solar and Lunar. 5. The
Solar year, is that space of time wherein the Sun by his proper Motion,
departing from any one point of the Ecliptic, returns to the same again, and
therefore it is either Tropical and Natural, or Sydereal. 6. The Tropical or
Natural year, is the space of time, in which the Sun departing from one of the
Tropical, Equinoctial, or Solstitial points, and running through the whole
Ecliptic, returns to the same point again, and it is Quantity is 365d. 5h.
49. 7. The Solar Sydereal year, is the space of time in which the Sun returns
to the same Star from whence he departed, and it is Quantity as Astronomers tell
us, is 365d. 6h. 9. 8. That we call a Lunar year, (in ordering of which,
respect is had to the Lunar Motions) is either common or embolismal. 9. The
common Lunar year contains 12 Synodical Lunations, the extent of which is 351d.
8h. 49. 10. The Lunar embolismal year contains 13 Lunar Astronomical Months,
the Quantity of which is 383d. 27h. 33. and this year is frequently used in the
Lunar or Soli-Lunar Computation. 11. The Political or Civil years are those
whose use is in Civil and Ecclesiastical Affairs, in appointing them as well as
may be with respect to the Luminaries, but amongst the several sorts of Civil
years, the Julian is the most celebrated, as we shall show in the Sequel of
this Discourse. 12. And those sorts of years are either equal or mean, or true
and unequal. 13. The mean or equal are those that always consist of 365d. and
6h. but are not in common use. 14. The true Julian years, are either common or
Bissextile. 15. The common consists of 365 days and 6h. the Bissextile of 366,
and such are all the years of Christ when divided by 4 into aliquot parts,
according to that Distich.
Tunc bissextus erit, parts per quatuor aequas

Annos partiri cum poteris Domini.

16. But the Bissextile is a day arising from the 4 times 6 hours, which are
omitted in the Julian years.

. 1. THis word Annus or Year in the 3 Ancient The Etymology of the Word Annus.
Languages, is derived as it were from a thing that goes round, or a Circle;
for so much the Hebrew word (...) does signify; and for the same reason in the
Greek is it called (...), and some will have it the word Annus is derived from
the Greek (...) circum, but it is a little absurd to derive the Latin from the
Greek and they are more in the right, who say that the word did formerly
signify a Circle; however, it is certain that An coupled, did signify as much
as Circum, as in the word ambire, to which the Poet doubtless alludes when he
says,

In s^ su^ p^r ^^stigia volvitur annus.

Or it may be Annus from Anguis a Snake; for that the Egyptians before they had
the use of Letters, represented it by a Serpent or Snake biting her Tail, which
the Poet very well speaks of.

Est ignota procul, nostraeque impervia menti,
Vix adeunda Deis annorum squalida matter,
Immensa spelunca aevi, quae tempora vasto
Suppeditat, revocatque sinu. Complectitur antrum
Omnia qui placido consumit Numine serpens,
Perpetuumque viret squamis, caudamque reducto
Ore vorat, tacito relegens exordia lapsu.
. 2. But Astronomical Years do not depend Of Astronomical years.
wholly on the Luminaries, since by the Stars there could be no denomination of
the year, and it is very certain that the Saturnine year is computed to 955
days, 12 hours, or almost 30 Julian years; and the Astronomers make the Jovian
year to have 4331d. or almost 12 Julian; the year of Mars 687 days, or almost 2
years, but the years of Venus and Mercury as to their extent, differ not much
from the Solar Motion. And the fixed Stars have also their Periods, though they
move but very slowly, which is the reason a year of these according to
Hipparchus and Ptolomee is equal to 36000 Julian; to Alphonsus 49000, to Tycho
Brahe and Kepler 25806, and to Longo-montanus 26046, as Ricciolus Tom. 1. Almag.
notes these and others opinions, and from him Macrobius observes In form says.
c. 11.
that a year is not only what we commonly call so, but the Stars as well as the
Luminaries have their years, that is, a Motion from a certain place of the
Heavens, to the same again.

. 3. The Tropical Astronomical year of the Why also called Tropical.
Sun is not so termed from the Solstices, as some of the Ancients were of
opinion; but generally from the points of Changings, and the Suns double
Motion; for many Authors show that the Equinoctials, as well as Solstitials are
called Tropicks, as Manilius About the end of the 3. B.
, and Sextus Empiricus L. 5 c. 1.
in the Edition of Stephanus, do make appear.

. 4. The Solar Sydereal Year is greater than the Tropical, because the fixed
Stars use their Less than a Solar Sydereal.
own Motion, and whilst that the Sun performs it is course through the Zodiac,
they move 50 faster toward the East; therefore the Sun wants at least 21 to be
even with them, and by so much is a Sydereal year greater than a Tropical.

. 5. Some will have it that the Achaians Solar Sydereal years, by whom used
made use of this Sydereal Solar Year, which they began with the rise of the
Pleiades or 7 Stars, and that the Egyptians nicely observed the rising of the
Sun with the Dog Star, as it appears from their Ancient writings; yet it is
owing more to fancy than any Astronomical strictness, to have respect to the
Sydereal Solar Conjunctions, and that more in such an Age, wherein the slowest
Motion of the fixed Stars was not sufficiently known.

. 6. But the Turks and Arabians make use of the Lunar year somewhat adapted to
civil use, and the same custom is also observed in Tartary, Si^m, Japan, Peru,
and other places; and those that attribute this Custom to the Gauls and
Germans, seem not mistaken, since Bid, who doubtless was well acquainted with
our Ancestor's, their way of Computation, is very plain that they made use of
the Lunar year; these are his words, Cum vero Embolismus, hoc est 12. mensium
Lunarium annus occurreret, superfluim mensem aestati apponebant, ita ut tunc
tres menses LIDA vocarentur, and ob id annus ille TRILIDI cognominabatur. Yet
the Ancient Names of the German Months oppose this opinion, which as they are
marks of the appointed Seasons, so do they supply instances of a Solar year,
such are Giuli, etc. but some may say that these are later Names, and our
Ancestors only had 'em from the Romans.

. 7. The Lunar Year has this inconvenience, The Inconveniences of the Lunar
year.
that the same Months in several Lunar years, have not the same Season, the
occasion of which is, that the Lunar year being less than the Solar by almost
11 days, in three years time every Month will have the Season of that which
went before it, and so further in succession of time, viz. in 16 years those
Months which were in Summer, will be Winter, and vice versa, a thing the Turks
who use this sort of years, are very sensible of.

. 8. However the Jews who follow the How the Jews appoint their Months, Years.
Moons Motion in their Accounts, by intercalating an entire Month, retain still
the same Seasons every Month, and as often as there is the difference of 30
days between the Common Lunar, and the Solar Year, they substitute an
Embolismal Month called the Veadar, and hence it is that they have Lunar Months
in the same Season; and their year may not improperly be called Lunae-Solar.

. 9. But Kepler says that the Jews after their Of their Calendar after their
Departure out of Egypt.
departure out of Egypt, used only the Solar year so that, thereby he would
make the Lunar Solar Calendar but of late date. His Description of it is in the
following words, Patriarchas quidem aio, etc. The Patriarchs, says he, made use
of the Egyptian year of 365 days, divided into 12 Months, 11 of which contained
30, and the 12th 35 days. But whereas the beginning of the Egyptian year went
through all the Seasons of the year at their departure out of Egypt, it happened
in Autumn, whereas it should have happened in the Spring; for which reason Moses
commanded the Month of first Fruits to be made the first Month, by which the
Egyptian movable year became fixed. But admit this to be true, it does not
thence follow, that a Lunar was Established according to the Egyptian way; I
know some Objections, but shall not take upon me the place of an Adversary.
However this I confess, the Jewish year until the Grecian Monarchy, to have
been Solar, not Lunar; and so he goes on further, page 91. with whom Lydial
agrees in this opinion (Viz. That the Jewish year always began about the N.
Moon, and that all the other Months save the last, did consist of 30 days. Now
this is not worth contending for, for though it may well be supposed that the
Jews after their Departure out of Egypt, did not leave their Ancient Solar Form
of the years; for according to Josephus, none of their Ancient rites as to
their year were innovated; yet however we cannot be persuaded but that their
Ecclesiastical year from their departure out of Egypt to the time of the
Macedonians, were purely Solar, without the least Regard to the Lunar Motion,
since we find frequent mention made of it in the Holy Scriptures.

. 10. As to Mystical Years, since they are only Of the Julian year.
the Offspring of one Man's Brain, and never yet used by any sort of People,
what we have said of Months, may indifferently be applied to the years which
are merely fictitious, and grounded neither on Holy or Profane Writings, nor
Revelation which the Author Hainlinus mostly seems vainly to value himself upon.

. 11. But Chronologers use the form of the Of the Julian year.
Julian year, as a constant and acurate rule of their times, whence it happens
that they do not only refer to the Julian Calendar, those things which came to
pass after it is first Institution, but by way of prolepsis, make use of the
same from the beginning of the World, nay, before the beginning it self; and
that for 3 Reasons. 1st. Because this sort of year is universally known, and as
equally fitted to the Egyptian, and Nabonassarean as other years. 2ly. That
after the Nabonassarean, it is the most plain and easy of any. 3dly. Because
the same Months in this year, have the same changes of the Seasons fixed, which
and other like Reasons induced that famous Mathematician, Kepler, to lay aside
the Gregorian, and make use of the Julian in his Tables of Heavenly Bodies;
nay, and Petavius, though very much addicted to the Gregorian Style, cannot but
give the Julian this Character, viz, the Julian year (says he) when fitted to
use, is the most agreeable to the Nature of things, since that comes as near as
can be to the course of the Sun, and is no less fit to Register the times, for
which reason it is made use of in the Chronicles and Annals of most Writers,
and that not only in recording of things since its Institution, but before nay
from the beginning of the World it self. Wherefore for example sake when they
would assign the Eclipses of the Sun or Moon, or the Wars of Cities and
Kingdoms, and their famous Actions in their years and seasons, they always make
use of the Julian Years and Months, as if they were then used by them, which by
Anticipation and a sort of fiction they institute, by which ours will more
easily agree with them, being fitted to the common times. Nor will the Reader
be tired in observing the different sorts of years. For Petavius says that it
is the most exact Account of time, and easiest to be made use of, and which
beyond all others is most fitted to common use, and comes nearer to the
Revolution of the Sun, than any other sort of year whatever; and these and many
other Reasons there are, why the Julian year should in general be explained,
being likewise the Receptacle of all other Epocha's.

takes it. For (says he) it matters not whether it be on the former or the
latter days, since that those are but accounted one, which Marcellinus notes,

to be 365d. 5b. 48. 55. it thence appears, that the difference of quantity
between them following the said Longomontanus's Hypothesis, is but 11. 5. which
Chronologers usually call the Civil Equinoctial Procession; and that because in
so much time the places of the Equinox do vary in the Julian year, by which
means in the space almost of 130 years, the Equinoctial and Solstitial points
seem to go backward a whole day.

. 14. As to the space of time of the great Of the great Canicular year.
Canicular year, which is called the Stoic or Cynick period, Censorinus gives
us this account of it (f): The Moon (says he) belongs not to the Egyptian year,
which we call Canicular; because it begins the first day of the Month they call
the Thoth, when the Dog Star arises. For their Civil (d) De Die Not. c. 18.

4 years with them, is almost a day less than the Natural 4 years, by which it
happens that in the year 1461. it revolves to the same place. This year is by
some called Heliacal, as belonging to the Moon, and by others (...).

light of Scripture, and consequently of the Original of the World, so they err
strangely about its end. The great year of Plato was a very notable fiction.
The Stoics as well as the Platonicks, thought that the World must have
naturally an end, when all the Stars were again revolved to the same point; but
what Period of years this Revolution may require, is not as yet known, even
Kepler himself despairs of the Possibility of this invention, when he asserts
that the Motion of the Stars are incommensurable with themselves.

confound it with Plato's great year, from which notwithstanding it differs,
which Censorinus further thus speaks of: There is (says he) another year, that
Aristotle calls the greatest, rather than the great, which the Spheres of the
Planets constitute when they come together, to the same places where they were
before; the Winter of which made the Worlds Deluge, and its Summer will make
the last Conflagration, etc. but Marsilius makes mention of another real year,
in which the Soul of Man finishes its Circuit of Transmigration, which time
they say is performed in 12000 years, to 3 of which years, the great year of
the World is equal, consisting of 36000 years, wherein the Anima Mundi performs
its Course; but Peter of Aliacus the Cardinal, does otherwise determine the
Quantity of the great year; for says he, as from the beginning of Aries to the
end of Virgo, is equal to the half of that space, which is from the beginning
of Libra, to the end of Pisces; so ought there to be from the Birth of Christ,
to the end of the World, as much time as was from Adam, or the Creation of the
World, to the coming of our Savior; this space was 5260 years, therefore
according to him from the beginning of the World to the end will be 10400, all
the Stars finishing their Courses, etc.

CHAP. VII. Of the Epacts.
1. Under the Name of Epacts, we usually understand the Difference between a
Lunar and Julian year. 2. The Epacts are either Civil or Astronomical. 3. The
Civil Epacts are days intercepted between the common Julian year of 365 days,
and the Lunar (taken at large) of 354 days, hence the Annual Epacts consist of
11 days, except in every 19 year in which there are 12. 4. The Astronomical
Epacts may be termed those Days, Hours and Minutes, which are intercepted
between the common Lunar year, and the mean or equal Julian year, which are
10d. 12h. 11. 22. 16.
. 1. THe word Epact is derived from the Greek The Etymology of the Epacts.
(...), which besides other things, signifies to intercalate: In which sense
Plutarch in Numa uses it; and in the Egyptian Nabonassarean Computation, the 5
days besides 12 Months, consisting of 30 days to complete the year, are termed
the (...) or added days, and therefore because the Epacts are days that are to
be added to the Lunar year, this Denomination is no ways absurd.

of the quantity between the Lunar and Julian year; for the common is not
Equal, but less than the Julian, but both are made use of in the Ecclesiastical
Account; some Authors bethought themselves of reducing the one to the other,
which they effected by appointing the Epacts.

. 3. A difference indeed was ever between The time when first known.
the Lunar and Julian year; but because Sosygenes the Author of the Julian
Calendar, in that form of a year he proposed to Caesar, little regarded the
Moons Motion; it is probable that the use of the Epacts was anciently unknown,
and came in use with the Cycle of the Moon, in the time of Dionysius: therefore
since the first year of the Dioclesian era, had the first Cycle of the Moon,
and no such cause could be taken from the motion of the Moon, it may be
supposed that the order of the Lunar Cycle, and consequently of the Epacts, may
be deduced from the Dioclesian era; and after that to be taken, or rather the
invention of Meto, Calippus and Hipparchus, being lost and obliterated, to have
been used amongst the Christians.

. 4. There are some other Writers, who by How some Writers receive the same.
the Epacts understand the difference between the Lunar and Solar Tropical
year, and others between the true Julian common, and the mean Lunar year, in
which sense Joannes Baptista Ricciolus, Almagi^^i Nov. part 1. f. 1. p. 241.
takes them. In the Rodolphin Tables Epacts are calculated to be 10d. 15h. 11.
21. 49. 33''''. in the Prutanick 10d. 15h. 11. 21. 52. 24''''. but according to
Nicholas Mulerius in the Frisick Ptolomaick Table, that time is supposed to be
the Epacts, which is computed backward from the beginning of the year, to the
next preceding new Moon, which agrees to what before we have laid down.

. 5. The greatest number of the common Number of the Epacts.
Epacts is 30, for as often as the number of the Epacts exceeds this, so
often is the whole Embolismal Month consisting of 30 days, always to be added
to the Lunar year, so that it may be equal to the Solar or Julian year. And the
30 days of the Embolismaean Month, absorbs this Addition, that in the
Computation of Epacts they are not accounted for, as the Authors of this way
have persuaded themselves and others. The Table of Epacts in this our Age, is
as follows.

into themselves again in 19 years, which being elapsed, the Ancients were of
opinion the Cycle of the Epacts were exactly performed, for which reason at the
Numbers of this 19 years Cycle, they were wont to fix the Epacts of the Moon,
as in the following Table; the meaning of which is thus. The Product of the
Character of the Cycle, and 11 being divided by 30 the 3 s. being taken away,
the remainder is the Product of the Moons Cycle.

the common year cannot easily be had, therefore parts of days belonging to the
Lunar and Julian years, although they are really unequal, yet in common use may
be made equal one with another till that in the last year of the Lunar Cycle,
they may be by the Lunae Saltus laid aside.

. 8. Chronologers make frequent mention of Of the meaning of the leap of the
Moon.
this Saltus Lunae or the Moon-leap, in treating of the Epacts; this happens in
the last year of every Cycle, by reason that in the space of 19 years, the
Excess of the Julian year above the Lunar is at large computed at 209 days,
which being divided by 30, it gives 6 Embolismal Months; and 29 days will
remain, which when the Cycle is resolved into it self, 30 days are taken in
stead of 29, or a 7th Embolismal Month, whence it follows in stead of 11. in
the Epacts we must use 12 in the 19th year; wherefore when the Epact of the
last year exceeds one day by a Metonymia, they call it the Moon-leap, or Lunae
Saltus.

. 9. The Quantity of Astronomick Epacts may The Quantity of Astronomic Epacts.
be thus known. The mean Julian Year being 365 Days, 6 Hours, and the Lunar,
according to Tycho Brahe's Hypothesis, 254 Days, 8 Hours, 48 Minutes 37 44. So
that the difference will be 10 Days, 21 Hours, 11 Minutes, 22, 16, which
difference ought every Year to be subtracted from the Julian Year, that the
mean New Moons and Full Moons may return to the same Julian Day again.

. 10. The reason of the Saltus Lunae, and the Reason of the Saltus Lunae.
Use of the Number 12, instead of 11 in the Epacts in the last Year of the
Cycle of the Moon, is because the true Difference between 19 Lunar, and 19
Julian mean Years is 206 Days, 18 Hours, and almost 36 Minutes: So that if for
every Year 11 Epacts were only used, there would happen 209 in 19 Years; and
then the New Moons would change the Epacts 2 Days and more: Therefore to
prevent this, an Embolismal or 30 Days Intercalation, which Astronomers define
to be 29 Days, 12 Hours, 44 Minutes, 3, 8, 39'''', is always made use of, and
so the Quantity of every Embolismal Month exceeds the Astronomical 11 Hours, 15
Minutes, and 57 Seconds; which multiplied by 7, is equal to 3 Days, 6 Hours, 5
Minutes, 39 Seconds; and these being aded to the Difference between the 19
Julian and Lunar Years before determined, the same will make 210 Days, 1 Hour
and almost 28 Minutes. Now, that the Epacts might attain to this Sum, 12 is
assumed to the 19th Year: By which the Number of the Epacts is equal to 210
Days; and the difference is only one Hour and a few Minutes.

. 11. Yet although the Cyclic Defect Of the Cyclic Defe^t.
of 1 Hour and a few Minutes may seem but small, for which reason the Ancients
took no further Notice of them; yet in the space of near 312 Years they make an
entire Day, whereby the New Moons get before the Epacts: Therefore in this our
Age it is necessary aforesaid Epacts be augmented by 3, and they will serve us:
Or if the Product of the Character of the Cycle of the Moon, and 11 be divided
by 30 the Remainder (besides the Quotient) will express the Number of the
Epacts, as is showed in the Table hereafter.

. 12. The Use of Epacts is to show in their The Use of the Epacts.
Places, the Moon's Age, and chiefly the Full Moon before Easter, which is the
Use the first Authors of the Epacts intended them for.

means the Age of the Moon every Month may be every Day known.

the 14th Moon or Easter from the Epacts, then the Sum of the Epacts being less
than 26, must be subtracted from 47; if greater, or equal to 26, they must be
subtracted from 46; the Remainder will show the Day reckoned from the Calends
of March, on which Easter ought to be assigned in the old Calendar.

Chronologers are often mistaken; who laying aside the more tedious way, make
use of this short way, which shows the Errors both of the Julian and Gregorian
Style.

CHAP. VIII. Of a Lustrum, Saeculum, or Aevum.
1. A Lustrum is a certain Space of time anciently appointed for Civil Use; and
though formerly it was reckoned to consist of 5 Years, yet Chronologers do now
repute it only as Four. 2. An Aevum is sometimes taken for the Age of a Man,
sometime it denotes Infinite Duration. 3. A Saeculum is the Space of One
Hundred Years.

expiating: For in times past when the Sacrifices were performed; the Tributes
were paid both by Capitation of the Men, till the time of Constantine the Great
(as is now done amongst the Turks) and also according to the Custom of Taxing
Acres of Land and other Goods. The Ancients also, as Festus remarks, were wont
to let out their Vide Matthew. Wesen. paratitla, ad dig. L. 1. Tit. de Censibus

Ancients unanimously assert, that It Was the Duty of the Censors to purify
(lustrate) the People.
Lustration amongst the Romans was the Duty of the Censors. These Leased out
the Public Revenues, took care of the Highways and public Buildings,
examined the Riches of every City, and inspected their Manners.

. 3. Servius Tullius Son-in-law of Tarquinius The first Author of this
Lu^^ration was Servius Tuliius.
Priscus, introduced this Custom: For of him Live. Lib. 1. C. 42.
Livy thus writes; He instituted the Valuation of every Man's Estate; whence
Taxes were laid not by Capitation of Men, as formerly; but according to their
Estate. In another Place C. ^4.
he ascribes to him the Solum in the Language of the Et^^^ci signifies wh^le.
Suovetaurilia or Solitaurilia (an Immolation of a whole Bull, a Ram and a
Boar): The Taxation of the Estate being made (says Li^ius) which he hastened by
fear of the Law being made against those that avoided it; as also by
Threatenings of Death and Imprisonment, all the Roman Horse and Foot appeared
in Centuries in the Field of Mars; where, after Exercise, he (Iustravit)
purified the whole Army by the forementioned Sacrifice, whence this Action was
called the Lustrum, being perfect at the finishing of the Taxation.

. 4. This Case is controverted amongst the The Return of the Lustrum amongst
the Romans was every 5 Years.
Antiquaries: Plin. L 2. C. 47. G. ^udaeus in Pand ad L. etc.
Some will have it that the Lustrum amongst the Latins answers to the
Olympiads amongst the Greeks, viz. a Space consisting of 5 Years from Lustrum
to Lustrum inclusive; yet so as that every fourth Year being finished,
reckoning the Lustrum one; on the beginning of the 5th a new Lustrum was
performed; and on the 9th another, and so on: But Isid. Hispal. L. 5 C. 37.
E^ym. ^arnab. Brison. de significat. verb. L. 10. Jos. Cast^l. Tab. Capit.
Varro, Ovid. Hor.
others of better Authority will have but one Lustrum in five Years, reckoning
the Lustrum the last of the five. Claudian is very particular in this matter:

-- Cum flavescentia centum
Messibus aestivae d^^^ndens gargara falces,
Spectatesque iterum nulli celebrantia ludos
Circumflexa rapit centenus secula Consul.
His annis, qui Lustra mihi bis dena recensent,
Nostra ter Augustos inter pomoeria vidi
Temporibus variis, etc.
But perhaps this difference amongst Authors arises from the Change of the
Lustrum: For according to Livy, when Aemilius was Dictator, it was changed from
5 Years to one and a half. However, among all Chronologers at this time a
Lustrum is reputed constantly for the space of four Years, which was the first
Opinion.

which makes 1461 Days; the other is made up of 4 common Years, or 1460 Days.

it is used by the Nurse in Seneca's Tragedies, dissuading Hippolytus from a

Duration of finite Minds is commonly expressed by this Word. But Censorinus De

makes no distinction betwixt Aevum and Eternity: Aevum, says he, is tempus
unum, etc. is one and the greatest Time, immense without End, which always was,
and ever shall be after the same manner; nor is any one concerned in it more
than another: And afterward, That which has no End cannot be compared with
Measure: Wherefore I shall not endeavor to measure out an Aevum by any Number
of Years, or Ages, or lastly, by any Model of finite Time.

agreed in his time about the Quantity of a Saeculum. He distinguishes it into
Secula Naturalia and Secula Civilia. The Natural he defines to be the longest
Space of a Man's Life, which being variable and unequal, he first comments upon
the manner of the Etrusci: The Ritual Books of the Etrusci (says he) seem to
teach us these Naturalia Secula, viz. They examined when any Town or City was
founded, who at that time were born; from thence beginning their Secula
Naturalia; the last of which dying, the Seculum expired: Again, of all that
were lately born and alive at that time, he that lived the longest determined
the second Seculum Natural, etc. The Seculum Civil is the Space Varro de ling

of Varro and Discorides, that at Alexandria, where they were used to preserve
their Dead, they took notice of those that died in their full Strength, and
observed the Increase and Decrease of their Bodies, viz. in the first Year they
increased 2 Drams, the second 4, and so on till 50 Years; and after the 50th
Year they decreased again, each Year two Drams; till at the End of an hundred
Years they returned to the same Weight.

OF Chronological Characters,
BOOK II.
CHAP. I. Of Chronological Characters in general.
1. Chronological Characters are the Principles from which we show. 2. These
Characters are either Astronomical or not Astronomical. 3. Astronomical
Characters are those which are taken from the Stars measuring time by their
Motion, and are made use of to decide Chronological Controversies, such are
chiefly the Aequinoxes, the Solstices, the New Moons, the Lunar Phases, the
Eclipses of the Sun and Moon, the Conjunction of the Planets, either with the
fixed Stars, or betwixt themselves; and others of the like Nature. 4. Those
Characters which are not Astronomica^, are such as owe their Original either to
the Will of God or Man, and determine either Days or Years. Of which we shall
speak in order hereafter.
. 1. THAT Chronology does not want its Whether there are any, and what sort of
Principles in Chronology.
certain Principles is evident, if we consider those Characters, which in part
we have named; and which hereafter we shall explain: Nor is the Suffrages of
Witnesses in this Affair inconsiderable: For well, as St. Lib. 3 de Civ. Dei,
C^p. 3.
Augustine said, I am equally certain of the Building of Rome and
Constantinople. For what if I have seen Rome with my Eyes, I know nothing of it
but what I believed from other Witnesses. Therefore Chronology in this part is
like other Sciences, in which the Conclusion is not believed except it be
firmly proved or demonstrated. But if from Authority only without any Character
or other necessary Connection of Years, a Series of time shall be laid down how
the whole begins to be but Opinion, and has nothing in it to uphold a firm
Persuasion. But Chronological Principles differ from Physical ones in this; the
former relate to Knowing, the latter to Being.

. 2. When we argue from one Science to A Chronologer proving his Conclusions
from Astronomical Principles does not amiss.
another, where the Objects are different in toto genere; this is a Fault: but
whereas Chronology is subalternate and dependant upon Astronomy; and has its
Object contained under the Object of Astronomy, it is no Error, any more than
for an Architect to use Geometry, or a Musician Arithmetic.

. 3. Astronomical Characters are not made Astronomical Characters cannot be
conveniently used in Chronology to consider why Acting is but only that it is.
use of in Chronology as Conclusions, but as first Principles; then there is no
need of demonstrating them: Wherefore we think they act preposterously who
gives in their Chronological Writings whole Theories, and those of the Sun,
Moon and fixed Stars, which Petavius De Doctrina temp. lib. 8. De veris and
accutatis Solis ac Lunae motibus and amborum deliquiis agitur, a page 696.
usque page 886.
has also done in a very prolix Work: whereas the Knowledge of Astronomy is
supposed or taken for granted by a Chronologer.

. 3. It may sometimes happen the Aequinoxes Not only the* mean timex the
Aequinoes, Solstices, and Conjunctions of the Luminarier, but also the true, is
necessary to be known by a Chronologer.
Solstices, also the mean New and Full Moons may fall upon another Day, as the
true may; but whereas to find. out the true Places of the Luminaries require a
more prolix Calculation, let the Chronologer consult the Astronomer: But
whereas such Alteration seldom happens, he may, being not perfect in Astronomy,
be content with the Knowledge of the mean Motions.

. 4. The Conjunction of the Planets, their Other Astronomical Characters
besides what are laid down, may be assigned.
mutual Aspect, their Ingress into other Points of the Zodiac, besides the
Cardinal ones, with other Characters yet less frequent, may be made use of in
Chronological Concerns.

CHAP. II. Of the Hebdomatic or Weekly Character.
1. The Weekly Character is that whereby we distinguish one Day of the Week
from another. 2. The Week is a System of 7 Days continually recurring; and to
this end divin^ly ordained, That the Memory of the six Days Creation might be
preserved, that the seventh might be k^pt holy, and that Man and Beast might
rest. 3. One Denomination of the Days of the Week: is vulgar, owing its
Original to Gentilism, Another Chronological, repeating the Order of the Days
in the Week. 4. In common Use the Days of the Week are denominated from the
Planets in this Order: The first from the Sun, the second from the Moon, the
third from Mars, etc. 5. The Chronological Denomination of the Days of the Week
is disposed in Order; as, the first Day is called Feria prima, the second,
Feria secunda, etc.

sanctified; and from hence Men, to whom that Law was given, ought to continue
it so, since that Sanction was made only Mark 2. 27.
because of Man; but upon the 7th Day of the Creation this Sanction was made;
from thence there is derived the REmarkableness of this Character, add to this
the Mention of the Sabbath in Scripture as a noted thing, even before the Exodus
16 26.
Law was made; which without doubt, the Author of the Epistle to the (d) Heb.
refers, asserting that eternal Rest which God had prepared for his Children;
not only by the Possession of the Holy Land, but also by that Sabbath which was
prefigured from the Original of the World: Some also will refer to this that
Passage of Genesis 8. 11.
Noah; who in the time of the Flood sent not out the Birds till after the 7th
Day to try whether the Waters were abated; which Argument sufficiently
restrains and fixes the Sanction upon the 7th Day, as a positive and moral Duty
upon Men, notwithstanding the Objections of (c) Chap. 6. 3.
^ob Loeum. Tomarus Rivetus.
some against it, who would have the Sabbath take its Original from the raining
of Manna in the Wilderness.

. 2. All Chronologers who admit the Antiquity The Order of the (Feri^) or Days
in the Week, has been preserved always incorrupt till our times.
of the Hebdomatic Cycle, always look upon the Order of the Days of the Week to
have been the same; so that to deny it, would be to call in doubt one of the
first Principles in Chronology.

. 3. Joseph. Scaliger Lib de E^^nt Temp. p. 8.
Some will have it, that the Roman Why all the Days in the Week are now called
Feriae.
Church, whom all Chronologers follow, called every Day in the Week Feria;
Feria 1 ma, Feria 2 da, etc. because the old Ecclesiastical Year began from the
Pasca, and the Pasca was called Annus novus, as now in the Church of Antioch;
and for the same reason in that of Constantinople, (...); but all the Days of
the Pascal Week were called feriati, as St. Jerom^ and other Ancients witness:
And hence it obtained for the Days of the other Weeks to be called Feriae, in
imitation of that. Some say, we follow the Custom of the Jews in this
Reckoning; of which hereafter: But Tostatus, and after him, Corn^a Lapide, that
the Church by the Institution of Pope Sylvester, called all the Days of the
Week Feriae; First, because every Day in the Week ought to be a Holy Day to a
Christian: Secondly, That so far as related to Ecclesiastic Offices; and the
Ministers of the Church, those Days are really Feri^ or Festa, Holidays; and
every thing is to be rested from but Divine Worship.

. 4. We cannot seek for the Derivation of this Word Sabbath among the Greeks,
as Plutarch has done from (...), a Name of Revellers; nor among the Egyptians
a Sabbo, a Word signifying a Disease in the Groin; but it is derived from the
Hebrew Word (...) which signifies Rest, as referred to the Institution of God,
when after six Days Creation he rested upon the 7th. Lib. 5.
Cornelius Tacitus being ignorant of this Jewish Custom, has invented several
Fables about the Original of the Word; which may be perused by any one that
thinks it worth his Pains.

. 5. In times past they did not only call the 7th Day of the Week the Sabbath;
but from What it is we ought to understand about the use and signification ^f
the Word Sabbath
this very Day all the Days of the Week received their Denominations; as, our
Sunday they called the one or first Matthew! 28. 1. 1 Cor. 16. 2. Mark 16. 9.
Day after the Sabbath, our Monday the second Day after the Sabbath, Tuesday
the third, and so on: that by the Word Sabbath they sometimes meant the whole
Week, is evident from that Passage of the proud Pharisee Luke 22. 12.
(...), I fast twice in the Week. On the contrary, for the Word Week the
Ancients would sometimes use the Term Sabbath, as in this Passage; 2 Maccab: 6.
11.
(...) signifies no more than to keep the Sabbath.

. 6. Amongst diverse Opinions about it, that of What we are to understand of the
Sabbatum (...).
Scaliger seems to be most reasonable, and has been approved of by B.
Schmidius, Langius, and others, viz. (...), Hebraice (...) the first Sabbath
after the second of the Days of unleavened Bread: Upon which there was Oblation
of Fruits, and from whence seven Weeks Lev. 18. 15.
were reckoned till Pentecost: and therefore the Sabbaths betwixt the Pasca and
Pentecost were thus named:

The Saturdays before
(...) Quasi modo geniti. (...) Miscricordias Domini. (...) Jubilate. (...)
Cantate. (...) Vocem jucunditatis. (...) Exaudi. (...) Pentecosten.

Jews were w^nt to allege in Testimony ^f the Sabbath, which was sanctified by
God.
Israel In Council. Quaest. 36. in Exodum.
writes, that the Sabbatic River is a Testimony of the Sabbath sanctified by
God, whereof mention is made in the Babylonian and the Jewish Talmud: Rabat,
Jalcut, and Josephus also an Historiographer of great Authority, makes mention
of it as running through Phoenicia in Assyria; which after six Days of its own
Accord stops its rapid Course, and afterward runs after the same manner; and
therefore it received the Name of the Sabbatic River, from its Rest on the
seventh Day. Others R. Moses (...).
will have it, that this River is Gozen, over which the ten Tribes passed, and
at the Coming of the Messiah they shall be freed from their Captivity; and
according to the Ancient Wisemen Cap. 4^. 9.
Isaiah speaks of the People beyond this River, which is commonly called Flumen
Lapidum. But these are childish Fables of the Jews: For the abovementioned
Josephus says, This River runs very swift on the Sabbath Day. These are Rivers
that run only out of the Brains of the Rabbi's, which are near akin to the
Poets.

Christians many wonderful things are spoken of the mysterious Character 7. Nor

firstof these (viz. 3.) says he, is wholly odd, and denotes Excellency; the
other is perfectly equal, and denotes the Mother of Justice, Equability and a
sacred Agreement in things. This Number 7 is also assumed into the most sacred
Mysteries, is concerned in the Formation of Corporeal Things, and appears a
Symbol of Perfection. Others, as Philo, Robertus Pontanus, etc. reckon up those
things wherein the Number 7 is concerned; as almost all Sacrifices were offered
by sevens, as 7 Bullocks, 7 Rams, which always was observed by that mercenary
Numb 23. 1.

Passage of the Poet;

And those who reckon up the Mysteries of the Number 7, tell us, that the chief
Feasts of the Jews were reckoned to 7 Months of the Year, and continued 7 Days,
in the Pasca they the unleavened Bread 7 days and then they reckoned 7 Weeks to
the Pentecost; many joyful Days were celebrated in the 7th Month. Wisdom built
her House upon 7 Pillars: In the Lamp of the Sanctuary there were 7 Candles:
St. John in the Revelations saw 7 Golden Candlesticks; and in Zachary a Stone
had 7 Eyes: In the New Testament there were 7 Deacons chosen; and through the
whole Apocalypse of St. John the different State of the Church is described by
the Number 7: Christ commands him to write to the 7 Churches of Asia, and their
7 Angels: The mystical Book was sealed with 7 Seals: 7 Angels with 7 Trumpets
and 7 Vials represented the State of the Church in the last Days. They yet add
to these in Natural things, that there are 7 Planets, 7 fixed Stars called the
Pleiades, the 7 Hyades; and both the Bears are figured with 7 Stars. There are
7 habitable Climates in the Earth: The Structure of the Humane Body is 7 Feet:

but the next Day after: And if that should happen to be a Bissextile, the
second Year would have begun on the third Day after; the reason of which from
the Quantity of our Year is evident: For the Common Year having 365 Days in it,

CHAP. III. Of the lesser Sacred Annual Character or the Sabbatic Cycle.
1. The Sabbatic Cycle is a System of 7 Lunae-solar Years continually
recurring, instituted by God for this reason, That the Earth and Men might have
their Vicissitudes.

. 1. THE Sabbatic Years are of Divine Institution, as may be seen at large Lev.
25. 2. where the Earth and the Vines were to be plough'd and gathered for 6
Years, and the 7th Year to rest and not be cultivated. See also Exodus 23. 11.
The beginning of the Sabbatic Cycle was the 7th inclusive from the time, when
the Division of the Land (into which the Israelites were then about to enter)
was to be made by Exodus 46.
Lot. If this be observed, all the Sabbatic Years will doubtless be rightly
fixed, and no Errors about it can happen; if not, we have no certain Character
can be assigned us to proceed upon.

Divine Command the Sabbatic Cycle was in use among the Jews before the

first Sabbatic Year of the Law was that in which the Israelites being brought
by Moses to the Borders of Jewry and Land of Canaan, a little after the Death
of Moses began to enter and possess it under their Captain Joshua: So that they
will have this Cycle to begin 7 before what is assigned by Scaliger, Calvisius,
and before these Eusebius. But this agrees not with the Divine Precept: For the
Jews at that time did not enter into the Land of Canaan; For although the Tribes
of Rei^ben, Gad, and of Menasses received the Kingdom of Sihon and Bashan from
Moses; yet it was not to these only, but the whole People that the Divine
Command was given: Nor was the Land on this side Jordan properly called Nunb.

Canaan: Nor did the Tribes inhabit it to whom it was assigned: For these

Tribes, to pass over Jordan, from whence, after many Years they Josh. 22. 3,

returned again. Add to these things, That Moses in Deuteronomy, which Book he
proposed to the People only one Cap. 1. 3.
Month, before his Death speaks of the Land of Promise, not as yet possessed, but
to be possessed. Deuteronomy. 6. 10. But when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the
Land, etc. Therefore it cannot be said Israel was entered into the Promised Land,
to wit, Canaan, before the Death of Moses.

. 4. Although by what precedes, it is certain Whether we are to think that the
Sabbatic Cycle was analogous to the Hebdomadic, and consequently whether it can
be of the same use in determining the first Year of the World.
that the Historical Beginning of the Sabbatic Cycle is to be derived from the
Distribution of the Land by Lot, yet we shall not reject their Opinion, who
think that God in ordaining this Cycle had respect to the Sabbath of Days; and
that therefore the first Day of the World was also the first in the Sabbatic
Year; as the first Day of Creation was the first in the Hebdomadic Cycle. For
this Opinion seems not improbable, when the Reason of this Cycle was not less
universal than that of the Diurnal Hebdomadic Cycle. Therefore the Opinion of
Rob. Pontanus Caledonius a Britain, does not displease us, when he asserts as
much, saying, De Sabbaticorum Annorum Period. c. 2. p. 13.
That the Reason of this sacred Observation preceding by sevens, has its
Foundation in the Law of Nature, as the Example of God himself, which precedes
all Laws, from whence we may fairly gather, that this Reason of reckoning by
Sabbaths has respect to the Original of the Word, and by a continual Series to
be deduced from the first Sabbath: That as God himself rested from the Work of
Creation on the 7th Day, so those Years of Rest, (Sabbaths and Jubile's) came
from the same exemplary Principle.

. 5. Some of the Jewish M^imonides c. 10. de Schemitha and Jobel.
Rabbi's seem to The Sabbatic Cycle is a Character of certain and indubitable
credit in respect of Time.
derogate from the Certainty of this Character when they tell us, The
Israelites had reckoned 17 Jubile's from the time they went into the Land of
Canaan, till the time they went out of it again. And the Year in which they
went out, when the first Temple was destroyed, was at the end of a seventh
Year, and the 36th of a Jubilee. For the first Temple stood 410 Years; and after
it was destroyed, this Computation was also lost and abolished; from thence the
Land lay desert 70 Years, and the 2 d Temple was built, which stood 420 Years:
And in the 7th, after it was rebuilt, Esdras returned and restored this Era
the 2 d time: And from that Year they began to reckon another Era, and made
the 3 d Year of the 2 d Temple Sabbatic: And they reckoned 7 Sabbatisms, and
consecrated the 50th Year, although it was not Jubilee, yet they reckoned under
the 2 d Temple, so as that they did consecrate Sabbatisms. Dionysius Petavius
also follows Maimonides, and is also of this Opinion Lib. 9. de Doctrina Temp.
c. 26.
. But as the Ignorance of the Jews in Chronological Affairs is very notorious,
so there is nothing at all in this Discourse of Maimonides which would shake our
Opinion, that is not apparently false; and argues the Author much mistaken
about the Computation of Esdras, at the end of 70 Years Restoration. For
Calvisius most truly Isag. c. 26.
says, For who could suspect that the Jews in a Babylonian Captivity of 70
Years, could forget their Sabbatic Years, and afterward institute others,
which should not be the same in order as those before the Captivity? why should
not the Jews as well have forgot their Sabbath Day, and afterward also
institute another? But this is impossible; for God, the Preserver of his own
Institutions and Creatures would not have suffered such Set-times to have been
disturbed from the Creation of the World: So that the true Sabbatic Years were
not changed, but truly restored after the Babylonish Captivity: For the Jews in
that Captivity had Fields, Jer. 29.
planted Vineyards, mowed and gathered Grapes: So that they were busied in
those very things as were most proper to put 'em in mind of their Sabbatic
Years. Nor did their Exile endure beyond the Memory of any that were then
alive. At this Day, wherever they are dispersed, they truly know and reckon
up their Sabbatic Years. How then could these forget them, who had celebrated
the Sabbatic Years in Judea, and were returned back again into Judea to
celebrate them after their Captivity? But admitting they had forgot 'em, yet
after their Return they would have learned 'em again of the Samaritans, who
celebrated the Sabbatic Years with the Jews before the Captivity, and had
constantly retained 'em all that time; for they were near Neighbors; the
distance betwixt Jerusalem and Samaria being not above 6 German Miles; and the
Nation of the Jews was very superstitious and tenacious of their Ceremonies, as
is well known. It Is therefore a vain thing for any one to suspect a Change in
the Sabbatic Years.

. 6. A certain Author Author Solis and Clavis Temp. itemque vindiciarum.
does not only conjecture, Whether the Sabbatic and Jubilean Tears never had,
nor could have any other Form than such a mystical one wherein 343 Days are
reckoned for a Tear.
but promises a Demonstration of the Affirmative; but we deny both, and our
Reasons are, 1. Because from the Author's own Confession, neither the
Scripture, nor any other, ancienter Book makes mention of such a mystic Year.
2. Because the six Years of Agriculture have without doubt sometimes coincided
with the Solar Year: For otherwise the times of Sowing and Harvest would have
been uncertain. 3. Because the Lev 25. 9.
Scripture attributes to the Jubilean and Sabbatic Years a fixed Beginning and
State. Thou shall reckon (says God) seven Weeks of Years, etc. Then thou shall
cause the Trumpet to sound every where on the 7th Month, on the 10th day of the
same Month, the Day of Expiations, ye shall cause the Trumpet to be sounded
throughout the whole Land. From which Words Interpreters have hitherto
inferred, that the Jews ought to begin the Jubilean Years from the same 10th
day of the Month Tisri; whereas it is immediately added, That ye may sanctify
the 50th Year. And although the Author of Mystical Computation (of whom we
shall speak in the next Section) has sought a Solution in the Ambiguity of the
Word (...) as a Proclamation, or a Command of the Solemnity of the Jubilean
Year; indeed it was joined to a certain Day of the Civil Calendar, whereas the
Jubilean Year, without any Relation to this Command, took its Original
elsewhere..... How ill it becomes a Learned Man to trifle in a serious Affair:
For who knows not that a better Account may be given of the Beginning, than of
the Proclamation of the Jubilean Years? who is ignorant of the Emphasis of the
Word (...)? Or who shall persuade himself that a Year should be sanctified
amongst the Jews some Months before it began? Maimonides speaks much juster In
Halacha Schemidda Vejobel. c. 10.
on this Subject. From the beginning of the Year, to the Day of Expiations, the
Servants were neither dismissed, nor did they serve their Masters, nor were the
Fields restored. What then? They did eat, drink, and were merry; and every one
put a Crown upon his Head: But as soon as the Day of Expiations was come, the
Senators of the Sanhedrin sounded Trumpets, and sent away their Servants free;
Fields were then also restored. 4. From that mystic Form which is against the
Laws of Sydereal Years, it would follow, that it might be possible that the
Product of one should maintain the Jews for three Years together (against Lev.
25. 21. and sequ. For although mention is there made of three Years; yet by no
means were they complete and separately reckoned, as is evident from the Place
just mentioned: On the contrary, it is evident that this Hypothesis brings in a
new Method destitute of all Probability. For if (for Example) the Beginning of
the Sabbatic Year should fall upon the Vernal Month Nisan; which would
sometimes happen, the Jews could not gather the Fruits, because of the Religion
of the Year; and consequently on the preceding Year they would hardly have
given themselves the trouble of Sowing; but neither was it lawful to sow about
Tisri the Autumnal Month of the same Year: Therefore they could not mow about
Nisan the Year following. It was therefore necessary for 'em to wait till they
could have the Harvest of the 3d Year. --

. 7. The Absurdity of that Opinion is The Mystic Sabbatic Cycle
hence evident: For admitting it, the Sabbatic Years would undoubtedly be
wholly deprived of their best Character when amongst the Sabbatic Years, from
the faithful Tradition of Historians, the intercepted time divisible into
aliquot Parts should not always be 2401 Days, or the Quantity of a mystic
Sabbatic Cycle.

prove his Opinion about the Sabbatic and Jubilean Years.
premises some Hypotheses, which, he says are founded in Scripture, and which
are granted by all that allow of the Old Testament, whether Christians, Jews,
or Turks.

1. That God made the World in six Days. 2. That on the 7th he rested from the
Work of the Creation. 3. That any 7th from this, and consequently all the
Multiples of 7 following one another in Arithmetic Progression (as 7. 14. 21.
28, etc.) were made Sabbaths or destined for Rest, in Memory of the preceding
six Days Creation, and resting on the 7th. 4. Therefore if from any Sabbath we
go backwards by the spaces of 7 Days, or the Interval of a Week, we shall at
last come to that Day of Divine Rest. 5. And this is an inseparable Property,
resulting from the Institution it self, and the Divine Fact, viz. That it
should be a Multiple of the Time, and calls back into our Memory, and points at
the Divine Rest, and the very individual Day thereof. 6. That God instituted a
Sabbatic Year as w^ll as a 7th Day, in memory of his Rest, in which he also
would have the same Lev. 25. 4.
Arithmetic Progression. 7. That in the Sabbatic Years he would have observed
and commanded the Observation not only of an Lev. 25. 4.
Arithmetic Progression, but also a Geometric one, viz. the Square of the
Sabbatic Year, or 7 7*49 Years he instituted for the Jubilee. 8. The Sabbatic
Year ought to be neither greater nor less than the time of Labor and (a)
Fruits or Culture of the Earth which in this Year God would have omitted. 9.
That time must be greater than 49, and less than 366 Days. 10. That there is no
Number betwixt 49 and 366, by which we can return back again to the Root 7,
unless 343, viz. the Cube of 7.
From these Hypotheses he says, follows this Apogogic Syllogism. Every memorial
time of Divine Rest taken from the 7th Day of Creation, ought to be multiple of
the Number 7, and by a given Regression, viz. both Arithmetic and Geometric in
a given Proportion, viz. Septuple, to point out the first of the Divine Rest,
or the Individual 7th of the Creation:

But the Mosaic, Sabbatic and Jubilean Years are a memorial time of Divine Rest
begun on the 7th Day of the Creation:

Ergo, etc.

And hence further he adds an Epistomonic Syllogism, as he calls it. Whatever
Years ought to be multiple of the 7th Day of Creation, and show the same by a
regression as well Arithmetic as Geometric, must consist of some Number betwixt
49 and 366; between which it is impossible they should be either more or less
than 343:

But the Sabbatic and Jubilean Years ought to be multiple of the 7th Day of
Creation, and show it by a Progression as well Arithmetic as Geometric; and to
consist of a Number betwixt 49 and 366: Therefore it is impossible that the
Sabbatic and Jubilean Years should have either more or fewer Days than 343. 10.
10, etc.

This is the Basis of this mystic Computation; but which is built upon the
Sand: For first of all our Mysteriographer puts us in mind of a strange
Agreement betwixt Christians, Jews and Turks, in their admitting of the Old
Testament. But how great soever the Agreement of the two former be, that of the
Turks is a Dream of the Author. Indeed we know the Hotting. in Hist. Orient. p.
409.
Turks value the Law of Moses, believe that Christ is the Son of Mary, the
Spirit of God, his Word and his Apostle, but only in such a sense as Mahomet
has left them. The Turks tell us of many things depraved in the old, many
things omitted, and many added: Nor do they acknowledge the History of the
Creation or the first Week from the Mosaic Writings, as the Christians and Jews
do; but are wont to report many Fables of them, which that Impostor invented;
as when God made Adam, the Throne of God, Paradise, etc. he held in his Hand a
Pen ^00 Miles long, and 80 broad. Besides, the Turks keep not the 7th but the
6th Day of the Week holy, contrary to Moses. So little occasion has our Author
from the Agreement of the Turks for the Foundation of any of their Hypotheses;
nor according to the sense of his 5th Hypothesis will meet with great Agreement
betwixt the Christians and Jews. The Times of our Savior's Nativity, his
Circumcision, of the Eremetic Fast, etc. are Memorials of those things which
happened long since; though no one ever yet of any mystic Multiples. Further, the
6th, 8th, and 9th Hypotheses are no where extant in the Old Testament; nor are
they received by any Christians, if you except our Hanlinus.
Author and his Disciples; nor are they granted by the Jews (not to mention the
Turks.) God had no respect to the first Sabbath in constituting this System of
Years; that from the 7th Day of the Creation the Quantity of the Year should be
deduced by an Arithmetic and Geometric Progression; there are no Footsteps of
it in that place our Author has cited in Leviticus. But the rest are evident.
So very false do we find our Author's Philosophy, when we consider the Lev. 26.
3, 4, 5.
Amplitude of of the Divine Promises. In short, the Author of this mystic
Computation has acted ignorantly, when he makes one of his Limits a System of
366 Days, when the Jews knew nothing of it, their Annus Communis being 354
Days, their Annus Embolimaeus 384, and the Mean 367. Having showed the Falsity
of these Hypotheses, we easiy see what Answer ought to be given to the
Discoverer of such Paralogisms, in which there is not the least Probability.

though the Fruits were not gathered in for the use of their Masters as being
common for any one, yet the Right of their Fields did belong to them, or the
Privilege, or Excellency, as some say, before all others. So that it is probable
they might gather the First Fruits, and offer some part to the Priests. But as
to the Tenths, the Priests had nothing to complain of, if in that Year wherein
the Fruits were not gathered (that they might be preserved for their Masters
Use) they did not receive the Tenths. 1. Because in that Year wherein God did
bestow as much as was necessary, for three Years, the Tenths of the Priests
were multiplied. 2. Because it was free for them in common with poor Persons
and Strangers, to enjoy the Benefit of such gathering, provided they laid 'em
not up in Barns or Granaries.

the Law, they wanted not abundance of Increase: but when they began to rebel
and grow stubborn, they sufficiently experienced what things God had forbidden
the Transgressors of his Laws. For when their Conquerors imposed Tributes upon
them they could not discharge 'em on the 7th Year. Josephus often mentions this
Calamity, and his Relation about Alexander the Macedonian, sufficiently proves
it: For when at Jerusalem he had learnt, that a Grecian should have the
Government of the Persians, glad of the Prophecy, as to be fulfilled in him, he
bid the Jews ask some great thing of him; to whom they answered, he could give
nothing greater than a Relaxation of the Tributes for the 7th Year; and that

CHAP. IV. Of the greater sacred Annual Character, or the Jubilean Cycle.
1. The Jubilean Cycle is a System of 7 Sabbatic Cycles, or 49 Lunae-Solar
Years continually recurring; and for this end divinely instituted, that in the
Judaic Republic, the Wealth of a jew should not oppress the rest; but that the
Good of the Tribes should always be immovable; as also that the Years of
Servitude might cease.

little read in Hebrew suppose; nor from the rustic Inclamation of the Greeks,
(...); but either from (...) which Word signifies a Ram, because this Solennity
was promulgated with a (h) Ram's Horn; or else from (...) which Root signifies
a bringing back; and that, as Serarius notes upon Joshua, with a certain
singular Emphasis of Joy and Mirth.

. 1. In Annalib. ^d An. 1584 Numb. 2 and 3.
Torniellus supposes it probable that Whether we have yet any Footsteps of the
Observation of the Jubl^ean Year.
the Jews never observed any Jubilean Year before the Babylonian Captivity. But
we dare not assert so much; whereas not only in the time of Joshua, but the
pious Kings, as David, Joshaphat, and others, its very probable they would have
some respect to the Reason of such a Divine Institution. In the 2d Kings v. 1.
and sequ.
the Jubilean Year seems to be described, when K. Joram graciously gave the
Shunamitish Woman (a) Josh 6. 5.
those Privileges that were proper to a Jubilean Year; and yet the
Circumstances of History seem to render this Opinion suspected: For Joram lived
about the Year 3053, and in 3061 was killed by Jehu, in which 8 Years no Jubilee
could happen. Perhaps that in Ezech. 29. 17, more probably refers to a Jubilee,
where he makes mention of a 27th Year: For I cannot see how that can relate to
any other Epccha at this time known; Of which more hereafter.

. 3. Whereas it is very certain we have not The Jubilean Cycle consisted of 49
Years
so many Jubilean as Sabbatic Years: And therefore from the latter we can
scarce judge of the Jubilean Cycle. From hence it happens that Chronologers so
little agree about the Quantity of this Cycle, but dispute with the greatest
Heats of these Darknesses of the ancient Laws. Of the five Opinions about this
matter, the first is, That the Jubilean Cycle consisted of 50 Here. Sain. ad
an. 2544. Serarius ad Josh. 13. Pareus, Cor. ^ Lap. i^. L^v. 25.
Years; the second is that of the famous William Langius, who L. de an. Christi
c. 11. p. 138, and seq.
contends that the Jubilean Year depended upon the Sabbatic ones yet so, that
after the Expiration of ^7 annual Sabbatic Years the same was one with the
50th: so that the Jubilean Year was always the first in the Annual 7: The third
is the Opinion of our Mystic Chronologer, who makes the Jubilean Cycle to be of
45 Julian Years and 271 Days over: The fourth Opinion is theirs Jos. Scal
Buntingus, Mesilinus, Codomannus, Mercator, Calv. Ubbo F^^mius, Helvicus, B.
Thummius, B. Behmius, Spanhemius, Petavius, Cloppenburgius, Junius, Tremellus,
and many more.
, who assert the Jubilean Year was the same with 7 times the 7th Year, or 7
times the Sabbatic Year, and so the Jubilean Cycle precisely made 49 Years: The
fifth Opinion is only proposed as probable by the same Cloppenburgius Schol.

reckon both by 49 and 50 Years, which he supposes very easy for 'em to do, the
great Period of Jubilean Years being admitted, which is made by multiplying 49
into 50, whose Product makes that Period 2450. We assent to their Opinion who
assert the Jubilean Cycle to consist of 49 Lunae-Solar Years: For besides that;
the Sabbatic Year had many Privileges in common with the Jubilean Year, which
is inferred from the Biblic Style, the Consent of the Jews, and Rabbi Adda's
Calendar, it would follow also that if the Jubilean Year was different from the
Sabbatic; the Earth would rest for two whole Years and the Jews must sustain
themselves with the Produce of one Year for four Years together, which seems
wholly repugnant to the Sense of the Divine Command: Nor does it hinder that
the same Jubilean Year in the Mosaic Text is sometimes called the
Quinquagesimus, whereas that is not to be otherwise understood than as Pindar
called the Olympiad, (...), and as we are wont to call the 7th Day the 8th. Of
those Characters which the Popes Instituted for their Jubilean Years.


. 4. The Roman Pontiffs, after the manner of Apes, have endeavored to imitate
the Institution of God in their Jubilean Institutions; but diverse of 'em after
different manners. The first Author of a Jubilean Year was Boniface the 8th,
whose Encomium Platina P. 231. de U. P.
gives: He ordained that every 100 Years the Treasury of Indulgences should be
opened; but the Publication of a peculiar Bull which is In Extra v. L. U. de
poenit. remis c 2.
extant, and which instituted the 1300th Year to be Jubilean. But Clemens the
sixth, (this precarious Institution of Boniface, since the Age of Man not
extending to 100 Years, might see no Jubilee) made every 50th Year Jubilean; to
which end he gave notice in the Year 1345 that the following 1350 should be a
Jubilee. This Bull is extant in the Book last cited in the Chapter of
Vnigenitus, in that Year, as Petrarcha witnesses, there was such a Concourse of
People at Rome, that it was no wonder if from such a defiled Air a most
grievous Plague arose, which so exhausted all Italy, that there were scarce Ten
Thousand left alive. But Urban the sixth corrected this Institution,
transferring the Jubilee from the 50th Year to the 33d; and he appointed that
the Year 1390 should be Jubilee: And afterward be continued every 33 Years;
whereof he saw not the first, but died in 1389: yet Boniface the ninth
celebrated the Jubilee which was forbidden by Urban the sixth; yet so as that in
the Year 1400 he again forbad the Jubilee; as Vide etiam Krantzii Metrop. olin.
l. 10.
Onuphrius witnesses. Lastly, when the Romans perceived that these Jubilean
Concourses were advantageous to them, Paul the second reduced the time of the
Jubilee to 25 Years, the Sanction whereof his Successor Sextus the fourth
confirmed by a peculiar Bull in the Year 1473, which is extant in the same Book
c. Quemadmodum. And by that it was ordained, that in the Year 1475 the Jubilee
was celebrated, and every 25th Year following. But of these Annual Jubilean
Solennities, and their Privileges (which are Indulgences) and of which you may
read more largely in their Bulls above cited, this is not the least Solennity,
viz. At that time the Pope opens (as they call it) a golden Gate, to which an
infinite Concourse of Men approach for obtaining the Remission of their Sins;
then he strikes the Gate with a little golden Mallet, which afterward, as a
Token of Honor, he gives to somebody; then the Workmen break the Gate with
Bars, and the People who force in, scramble for the Ruins of it among the Dirt*
and under the Feet of one another.

CHAP. V. Of the Solar Cycle.
1. The Solar Cycle is a certain System of Time, consisting of 28 Years, or 7
Julian Lustra's, which being elapsed, the same Order of Bissextiles or
Dominical Leters, return again, according to the old Method.

. 1. THE Solar Cycle is called a Period of 28 The Reason why the Solar Cycle is
called a Period of 28 Years.
Years; not because it shows the Motion of the Sun, but because by its help we
know the Dominical Letter or the Character of Sunday; and hence it appears,
that this Appellation is Metonymical, not proper; although the Cycle, if it be
wholly considered, does retain the Characters of each of the 28 Years, and the
Denomination of the whole from the Number of the Cycle sought. Why the Ancients
made the Period of Biss^xtiles* ^ Dominical Letters to consist of 28 Years.


. 2. The Reason is, because neither sooner nor later than after 28 Years, all
the Varieties return again which arise from the Changes of the Dominical Letter
and Bissextile: For if in the Nabonassarean Year there had been no Bissextile
(l) Vide Polyd. Virg. de invent. rerum, c. 8.
the Cycle of 7 Years would have sufficed, because when on the same Day that a
common Year ended, upon which it began, the following year would also begin on
the following Day, etc. But the Bissextile Year renders this Affair more
difficult: So that a Cycle of 7 Years will not be sufficient, because the last
Day in the Year is not the same on which it began, but the following: so that
in the space of 7 Years all the Variety cannot recurr as before, but there must
be the Number of Years for a Bissextile, viz. 4. and the Number of Days in a
Week, viz. 7. that are concerned, which multiplied, make 47 = 28 the Solar
Cycle. Vide Monach. Method. cap. 3.

derives a false Opinion of it, in thinking that the Nicene Council continued
till that time. In like manner Lib. 2. de Annis Christi, c. 7.
Langius thinks the Solar Cycle was owing to the fourth Year after the Nicene
Council, but with no greater Certainty than Scaliger had proposed his Opinion
before him. We cannot from any ancient Books find any Certainty about it.

serve for ever.

But in respect of the Gregorian Calendar, the last Table fails; and for the
present Age that which follows will serve.

were in the old Julian Calendar, but only 7; and they are placed in a
retrograde Order, as is evident from the preceding Tables: Whence also Beda
expressed the Order of the Dominical Letters in this Versicle:

Grandia, Frendet Equus, Dum Cernit Belliger Arma.

. 7. If we consider the Constitution of the Of what would be desirable in the
ancient disposition of the Solar Cycle.
Civil Year, the Cycle is convenient enough; but it answers less accurately to
the Reason of the Solar Year; because it supposes that every Year is 365 Days
and 6 Hours; whereas there are 11 Minutes wanting of that time.

CHAP. VI. Of the Lunar Cycle.
1. The Lunar Cycle or Golden Number, consisting of 19 Lunae-Solar Years,
whereof 12 are of 30 Days, 7 of 28 Days to the Month, as a System of Julian
Solar Years; which being elapsed, the mean New Moons are supposed to return
upon the same Days.

. 1. BEcause the Greeks were taught by their Oracles, Of the Number of Years.
that are required for the Sun and Moon to coincide again.
that their accustomed Sacrifices were to be offered (...), which they
interpreted of the Years of the Sun, of their Days and Months, which they
referred to the Moon; and were always sollicitous, how by certain Periods and
disagreeing Motions of the Luminaries they might reduce these to a Third
something in which they might agree; Hence in the ancient times they are said
to have used a Biennium, intercalating every other Year: But Fault was found
with this, and 'twas succeeded by a Quadrennium; upon whose Returns the Olympic
Games were celebrated. After this came the Octennium, of which mention is made
in rehearsing the times of Apollod. Bibl. l. 3.
Cadmus. (...), etc. But Cadmus sewed Mars every Year for those whom he slew:
But that Year was then the space of 8 Years. Vide Eusebius. Ec. l. 7. c. 20. Cens.

de doct. temp. T. 1. l. 2. c. 2. and in Uranolog. l. 4. cap. 1.
Hyppolitus, Cleostratus, Tenedus, Harpalus, and others of the Ancients seem to
have interpolated this Period of Years. Next come the Duodennium, which seems
to have been observed by the Learned only, and may be gathered from Censorinus
c. 18. The next was the Dodecaeteris, consisting of 12 Years. To this Chaldaic
Year there is a Name, which those that deal in Nativities accommodate not to
the Course of the Sun or Moon, but other Observations: Because then, say they,
Tempests, the good Success of Fruits, Barrenness, and Diseases happened. But
amongst all the Cycles of the Ancients, there is none more famous than (...) of
Meto the Athenian, which is used to be called The great Year of Meto, although
it is uncertain whether Meto was the first Author of this Cycle; though Livius
seems to attribute this Invention to Numa Pompilius, and Geminus to Euctemonus
and Philippus. This is certain, that this Cycle consisting of 19 Years
comprehends 6946 Days, or 19 Solar Years, and almost so many Lunar years, in
which they interpolated 7 times in this Order, according to Dionysius Petavius,
3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 19. But in the Course of this time Meto, or whoever was
the Author of this Cycle, thought that 235 Lunations would be exactly
completed, a hundred and ten New, and a hundred and twenty five Full Moons,
making nineteen Solar Years; afterward Calippus attempted to correct this
Period by conjoining four Metonic Cycles, and giving to them 22759 Days, taking
away one Day in the space of 76 Years. And yet Calippus found many other
Censors and Correctors, as Democritus, Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and others: All
which did not wholly reject, but only interpolated the Metonic Cycle.

. 2. All this was done at first that the Pasca Why not only Greek Insodels, but
also Christians at the beginning of the N. Testament were so sollicitons of the
Harmeny of the Lunae-Solar Motions.
might be rightly observed, and that in one Night the Sacrifice of Prayer might
every where be offered for the Resurrection of the Lord; for it is certain in
rightly celebrating the Pasca, they had respect in the force of the Divine
Institution, both to the Reason of the Sun and Moon, though they a little
mistook themselves; because they thought the Julian Year and Solar Tropic did
agree well together.

. 3. In ancient times the Asiatic Christians Of the chief Disagreement of the
Ancients in the Command of the Pascal Solennity, and for what reason the Lunar
Cycle was observed.
did continually celebrate the Pasca upon the 14th Moon, or in the Full Moon,
viz. at the same time with the Jews; and these alleged John the Evangelist,
from whom they received this Custom. But the Eastern Christians never
celebrated the Solennity of the Pasca, except upon the Lord's Day; nay, when
they seemed to have this Solennity in common with the Jews, and they alleged
for themselves the Custom of St. Peter. The Montanists, receded from both,
neglecting the Lunar Course; but looking only to the Solar, appointing the 9th
Calendar of April to be the Vernal Aequinox, and the Pasca to be observed upon
the 14th from this Day. Among the French Martinus Dumiensis and Beda relate
that the Pasca was anciently observed the 25th of March, the Custom of whom,
when Cirvelius would again introduce, he was for that stigmatized for his
Rashness by Mariana.

. 4. And they kept not the Solennities of their Fasti as indifferent things;
but against the Rule Of the great Esteem that Christians ad f^r these
Controversi^s.
of St. Paul, they condemned one another for neglecting the Punctilio's of
time. Now Pius the first, and after him Eleutherius were taken up with this
Affair; but above all the rest, Victor acted most violently, sending the
Thunder of his Anathema against the Greeks; but was successless, as many others
of the Popes were. The venerable Session at Nicea at last by degrees assuaged
his exasperated Disposition, as afterward this Custom of the Western
Christians obtained, according to Eusebius, Theodoret, etc.

. 5. Lib. Cap. 2.
Anatolius upon Eusebius mentions, Of the time in which the Use of the Lunar
Cycle was known to Christians.
that first of all in the time of the Nicene Council the Use of this Cycle had
been known: and this appears from an Epistle of St. Ambrose, It Is not a mean
part of Wisdom to define the Day of the pascal Solemn Assembly; both Divine
Scripture instructs in it, and the Tradition of our Ancestors, who assembling
at the Nicene Synod, amongst other things relating to Faith, did collect as
well true as admirable Decrees; for in that memorable Assembly, several Persons
skilful in Calculation, being gathered together, did as it were constitute a
Circle of 19 Years, as an Example for following Generations. This Circle they
called Enneadecaeterida. Let us follow that Example; not that we ought to doubt
with any vain Opinion concerning so great an Assembly; but true Reason being
found in it, let the Affections of all so concur, that upon the same Night our
Sacrifice may be offered for the Resurrection of our Lord.

. 6. Although we say that we have those things Whether the Christians received
the Lunar Cycle from the Jews.
which the Christians first invented from the Latter Jews, yet from the Scope
which the first Authors of the Cycle intended, it seems apparent that they
examined the secret Writings of the Jews, lest they should celebrate at the
same time the Feast of the Pasca with Unbelievers: For suppose the ancient
Lunar Cycle together with the Pascal Times were different from the Cycle of the
Jews, certainly Christians, could not know by the Use of the same Cycle at what
time the Jews would celebrate the Pasca, nor how they ought to refrain from the
sacred Things of their Adversaries Ration. page 9. de doct. Temp. T. 1. p. 615.
: Isaacus Argyrus confirms my Opinion in this, that before the Pasca of the
Christians the Judaic one was placed; which in the Holy, and first Oecumenic
Synod, the Holy Fathers so constituted, that it might be observed in what Day
of the Week the Pasca of the Jews fell, that on the following Lord's Day the
Christians might perform theirs.

. 7. Though the first Authors of the Lunar Cycle thought that 19 Lunae-Solar
Years were equal to Whether or no the first Authors of the Lunar Cycle thought
that 19 Luna-Solar Tears, or 235 Lunations were equal to 19 equal Jul. Years

19 Julian Years, yet it is not so, if we regard Mathematical Rigor; for they
will fall betwixt both: For 19 Julian Years make 6939 D. 18 H. but 19 Lunar
Solar Years contain only 6939 D. 16 H. 32, 20, whose difference is 1 H. 27, 40,
yearly. And so much do 19 mean New and Full Moons, lose every 19 Years which in
about 1257 Years make four Days almost.

. 8. To find the just time of the Pasca. the ancient Christians, as was now
said, used the Lunar Cycle; and that the Use hereof may more largely appear, we
shall lay down the whole Lunar Cycle, with the Pascal times, in which the
utmost Limits are the 23d of March, (for upon this D^^ the Author of the Vernal
Equinox would have it fall, which the Full Moon Pascal ought always to precede
very nearly; and April the 19th; whence Christians would never celebrate their
Pasca before the 22d of March, or after the 25th of April. To which the ancient
Verses of those Computers have Relation.

But in the Gregorian Year the Pascal Limits are found by the Lunar Cycle till
the Year 1700 from the following Table:

its Name; whereas it was a Rule for the Ancients in calculating the Full and
New Moons, upon which account Ration. p. 9. and de doct. temp. T. 1. p. 615.
Petavius says, Beginning at any Year. For Example, from that which gives a New
Moon on the 23 d of Jan. Feb. 21st, March 23 d, etc. Upon those Days he wrote
the Figure 1 in the Margin of the Calendar, on the 2 d Year they considered and
found the New Moons got forward about 11 Days, viz. on Feb. 10. and March the
12th, etc. and against those Days they placed in their Calendar the Figure 2.
So on the 3 d, 4th and following Years upon those Days, that the New Moon fell
every Month they placed the Figures 3, 4, etc. against them in the Calendar.
And at last having past over 19 Years, they renewed the same Figures again.
These were the Figures or Numbers in the Calendar which were called the Golden
Number. Others relate that the Alexandrians in times past sent this Cycle to
the Romans in a Silver Table, writ with Golden Figures, and thence they took
their Name.

CHAP. VII. Of the Cycle of Indiction.
1. The Cycle of Indiction is a System of 15 Julian Years perpetually
recurring, that the times of certain Pensions might be made known to the Roman
Subjects.

. 1. SOme of the Graecians will have Indictio quasi in Actio; and Cedrenus is
admired What we ought to understand by the Name Indiction.
for following this Opinion. Onuphrius will have Indictio to come ab Indice
Crucis, seen by Constantine when he fought against Maxentius: But these are
frivolous Conjectures. Indictio rather comes ab indicere, and was particularly
used at first to denominate a certain Species of Pensions. Apud Pudaeum in
Pandect p. 83.
Ascanius reckons up three kinds of Pensions or rather Pensitations, well known
to the ancient Romans. First, the Canon to which Imposts, Tributes, etc. were
referred. Secondly, the Oblation, at this time called the Aids: And Thirdly,
the Indiction, which the Ancients called Collecting. Cicero also calls it
collected. The Greeks call this Cycle (...). Dio calls it (...). In the same
Sense that the Olympias is called (...). Also (...), etc. which last Words are
used by the Writers of the Antiochian History. By the Pallad. de Rebus Gestis,
Chrysostom. and Cod. Theod. de Indulg Debit.
Latins Distributiones and Fusiones were commonly used instead of Indictiones.

. 2. There are many Opinions in this matter. The chief are these: Lib. 11. de
doct. temp. item in Ration. p. 1. l. 6. c. 1.
First, Dionysius Of the Original and Antiquity of these Indictions.
Petavius brings a great many Opinions about the time; but thinks them all
Conjectures. Canon. Isagog. l. 3. p. 179.
Joseph Scaliger thinks this kind of Pension of long standing; and that
anciently 'twas the same with the Lustrum of 5 Years; whence we find this
Inscription on Moneys ^. B. and ^. T. viz. (...), etc. There are Scal. in
Animadv. ad Eusebius. Jac. Usserius in Annal. ad aetat, munc. sext. p. 320.
others which deduce these Indictions from the Antiochian Era, which was about
48 years before Christ; from whence they also deduce the Julian, Adrian,
Antonian, Constantinian, Valentinian, etc. Indictions. Maximus Monachus and
Martyr in br^vi enn^rratione Christiani Pasch. Gr. Mon.
Others will have the Era of Indictions begin with the 2d of Augustus. Others
again Cedrenus and al.
will have the Indictions begin at that time when Augustus overcame Antoninus
at the Promontory of Epirus near Nicopolis; which happened about 31 years before
Christ. Sixthly, the famous L. 1. de Anno Christi. c 8.
Langius proposes a Conjecture to be examined by the Learned, whether or no
this Cycle belongs not to the Emperor Adrian, from the Annotation of a certain
anonymous Author in the first year of the 224th Olympiad. Adrian coming to
Rome, remitted those things which were done to the public Treasury of the
Emperor and Roman People, constituting a time of 16 years, from whence, and to
which it should become due. He whom this Learned Writer calls Anonymus, is the
same with Dio. Cassius, who has almost the very same Words in the History of
Adrian; as also in the History of Marcus Antoninus. Seventhly, There are those
Pentagath^s Onuphrius in Fastis. Scal. Marc. Zuet. Bo^horn. Hist. Universal. p.
267.
who settle these Indictions in the Year of Christ 313. because in that Year
Constantine overcame Maxentius; and suppose that this Tyrant was cast off the
Milv^an Bridge and drowned. The Eighth and last Opinion is the Vulgar; that the
Calculation of Indictions began on the 24th of September in the Year of Christ
312, which must certainly be true, from the Words of In the 4th Ye^r of the
272d Olymp.
Eusebius. (...). This Baronius, and his Epitomizer Spondanus, object against
Sc^liger. Isag c. 16.
Calvisius admits of no other Original of Indictions than this. Also Petavius,
because he would not contend against either Opinion, says, The vulgar
Indictions were deduced from the year of Christ 312. The same is also held by
De diverse. temp. Apell. c. 2.
Albericus Gentilis. We also are of the same Judgment; yet, First, we
distinguish betwixt the Lustra and Indictions, which Scaliger confounds.
Secondly, bewtixt the common Indictions, and those which kept their stated
Intervals, and the Uncommon, which were instituted according to the Will of the
Emperor and the Exigence of the Republic, as other Pensions were. Thirdly,
betwixt the Indictions themselves and the Cycle of Indictions; or betwixt the
Political and Chronological Use of Indictions. For it is certain, that the
Indictions which are referred to the ancient and more modern Times can be
deduced only from the Year of Christ 312, except any one had rather understand
by a Year the remote Interval of (...). Fourthly, we again note that the first
Year of Indictions may be joined to the Year of Christ 313. if we have
reference to the last 9 Months, the greater part of that Cyclic Year: for the
first year of Indictions began Sept. 24, or the 8th of the Calends of October,
Anno Christi 312; whence it is evident that the rest of the indictionary Months
may very commodiously be referred to the Year 313.

. 3. So (m) dreams a certain Person, when in Whether the Custom of reckoning
the times was ^st thought on by the Christians to re^oncile the Eva ^elists
with pr^fane H^st^rians.
his new, true and exact Chronology, falsely so called, he delivers a great
many Falsities about the Original of Indictions; which it would be too
troublesome to relate and confute. Those that please may consult the Author.

. 4. Historians labor under great Incertainties in naming the Cause of this
Institution. Herwart's Opinion is rejected: Scaliger's agrees not W^y (...)

(n) Joannes Georgius Herev. d^ Hohen^.
well with himself, where L. 15. de Emend. de Temp.
he labors in one place for the Antiquity of the Antiochian Indictions; and
elsewhere that they were deduced from the Quinquennales and Vicennales of
Constantine; but if the Elapsed from 15 years to 20 was called an Indiction,
consequently all the rest of the (...) may be so called: which Opinion about
Constantine is as different from the Principles of Historians. So it is well
confuted by D. In Man* (...). Chron.
Behmius, and rejected even by Scaliger's own Followers. Nor was Cardinal
Baronius more happy in opining; for he supposed that the Cycle of Constantine
ceased, especially as to its Use, among the Roman Soldiers: In the year of
Christ 312, when by the Institution thereof it came to pass, that having served
15 years, might have his Dismission, and go free wherever he pleased without
any Capitation: Or if he would tarry, he should then have greater Advantages;
whereas formerly they were to serve 16 years; which Opinion of Baronius, as it
seems improbable, so it is opposed by L. 11. de doct. Temp.
Petavius. Our Opinion is, that this Cycle was at that time known, when
Constantine the Emperor had need of Money to pay off his Soldiers, and renew
the War against Licinius; but this Era of Indictions was made more solemn;
because the same seemed to the Christians to be an Epoch of their restored
Liberty after the Conquest of Maxentius.

. 5. There are commonly reckoned up three How many Indictions were there, or
are there ^^w in use.
sorts of Indictions, whereof the first was called the Caesarean; because the
Caesar's had respect to it in paying Persons, and signing the Instruments of
Causes. This Indiction fell upon the 8th of the Calends of October, or on the
26th Day of September; For after Harvest was over, the time of Autumn was
thought most proper for paying Tributes. The second was called
Constantinopolitanean, in which they signed (as they do at this Day) the more
Oriental Calendars, as appears from the Briefs of the Hieremian Patriarch, and
of the Turco-Graecian Crucius. This begins upon the Calends of September;
whence some think that its Use began when the Graecians at the Solemnity of the
New Year chose the Autumn of the first Month thereof. Ambrosius understands one
of these Indictions, when he thus writes to the Bishops of Aemilia; This is the
first Month according to coming out of Egypt, and the First according to the
Law, and the Eighth according to our Custom: For the Indiction begins on the
Month of September. The third is called Pontifical, or the Roman, which begins
upon the Calends of January, and continually follows the 2 former, within 4
Months almost. To these may be added the Antiochian, which Canon. Is^gog. p.
2^5.
Scaliger by the Authority of Causabon, and the Patriarch Ignatius, certainly
determines Of the reason why the Roman E^perors wou^d have this Cycle of
Indictions known i^ the Common People.
to the Month of May.

. 6. We are commonly wont to preserve those things which appear useful to us.
In like manner the Caesar's, when at the stated times of Indictions, their
Treasuries were increased, ordained that the Character of Indiction should be
noted in the public Instruments. Thus we read what the Emperor Justinian
commanded in the 47th Novelia: Whence we oblige those who minister in Affairs;
or wherever any Acts are performed, and the Notaries who write their
Instruments in any Form in this great City, and in all other Nations whom God
has subjected to us, that they thus begin: In the third Year of the Empire of
the most Sacred Emperor Augustus, etc. and afterward to name those Consuls
which are in that Year; and in the third place, the Indiction, the Month and
the Day: So the Time shall be preserved in all Affairs: And these things are to
be fixed in Writings for the Memory of the Empire, the Order of the Consulate,
and other Observations What it was that the Subjects of the Roman People were

that may be interposed.

. 7. And 'twas not for the sake of Remissions but of collecting Subsidies, that
those Indictions were chiefly constituted; but what, and in what Order the
Subjects of the Roman People were to bring, the Ancients have not remarked.
Elegius Noviomensius Episcopus, who flourished about the middle of the 7th Age
in the 2d Sixteen of these H^mil. are extant in Biblioth. Patrum.
Hom. speaks of diverse Tributes (as the Moderns after him) according to diverse
Lustrums in which the Cycle of Indictions was finished. In the first Lustrum
there was a Tribute of Gold collected: In the second, one of Silver; and in the
third, one of Brass: And the Annotator upon the 47th Novella delivers the
manner very different. Anciently, (says he) the Romans in every 15 Years,
received a Tribute from the whole World. In the first 5 Years, Iron to make
Armor for the Roman Soldiers. In the 2 d Silver, out of which the Soldiers
were to be paid their Wages. In the 3 d Gold which was laid up in the Treasury
for the Roman Republic. But since, the Writers of the following Age make
mention of this Matter in so different a manner, that we can hardly believe
this Tradition.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Character of the Roman CONSVLATE.
1. The Roman Consulate is a Character wherein two Roman Consuls were named;
whence we come to the Knowledge of anything done in that time.

. 1. THE Reason of the Roman Consulate being mentioned among the Characters of
Times, is because both Latin and Greek Writers by nam^ng two Consuls were wont

Times.
fix the times of things done; and that by a most ancient Custom, which Lucan
intimates while he calls these Years Consular Years: And amongst the Latins,
Pacatus in a Panegyric delivered to Theodorus Emperor of Rome, speaks
remarkably; A certain Captain is promoted to perform the Discipline of Sieges;
a Prefect is preferred to look after a Province; a Consul is created to give a
Name to the Year, etc.

. 2. After the Ravishment of Lucretia by Of the time in which the Off^^e,

the Son of Tarquinius Superbus, the Romans having abolished the Regal Dignity,
created Consuls to govern the Empire, rather to consult with, than to domineer
over their Liberty, or one King two Consuls were created; that if one should
prove bad, the other having equal Power might restrain him: And 'twas the
Pleasure of the People that they should not enjoy the Empire above one Year,
lest a Continuation of their Power should render them insolent; but they were
always civil, knowing that after one Year they should be deprived of all again

who derive their Name from the End or Design of it; which was to consult and
provide for the Citizens. Flor. Lib. 1. c. 9
Others derive their Name from their Office, which is to consult; that is, ask
the Senate. Others interpret 'em a judicando, which, in the sense of Quintilian
Lib. 1. c. 9.
is the same thing as consulendo; from whence this Proverb, boni consulas, i.
e. judices. But the Judgment of Lipsius about this Diversity is, that the first
Etymology is more popular, the third more subtle, the middle more true; because
'twas the Business of a Consul to interrogate and refer to the Senate; as
Livius Lib. 7
has written; 'twas his part to enquire into their Judgment. Cicero Lib. 3. de
Leg.
also says, Let there be two in the Regal Empire, and let 'em be called
Praetors, Judges, Consuls, a Praeeundo, Judicando, Consulendo: Let 'em have the
chief Power of the Militia: Let 'em obey no one: Let the Safety of the People
be their Supreme Law, etc.

. 4. As to the time of the Year the Consuls Of the time of the year in which
the Roman Consuls undertook the Consulate.
began, we find great Variation according to the Diversity of Times, which does
not a little disturb Universal History; we shall allege some from Dionysius
Halicarnassaeus and Livius. First of all therefore, who is he that cannot
gather from the Character of the Regifugium was a Feast amongst the Romans.
Regifugium held on the 6th of the Calends of March, that the Election of
Consuls fell upon February? For the Consuls followed the Kings, as is the
Common Opinion: The Successors of the first Consuls began their Consulate on
the Ides of March, on the Ides of May, on the 3d of the Ides, Sextil. on the
Ides of Sextil. on the Ides of December, on the Calends Sextil. on the Calends
of September, etc. as is evident from the two Writers abovementioned. At length
the Custom obtained, that the Calends of January were destined for the
Consulate, lest the Years of the Curulean Magistrates, especially the Consuls,
should differ from the Civil or Common Years; at which time we dare not say,
that the Heads of the Roman Republic undertook the Affair. It Is the Opinion of
Justus Lipsius, that from the Year 598, the Epitome Liviana, c. 47.
Calends of January were sacred for the Change of the Consuls: Nor in the Times
of Lib. 4. de Pont. Eleg. 9.
Ovid was it different, as appears from these Verses:

Altera Laetitiae est, nec cedens causa priori:
Successor tanti frater honoris erit.
Nam tibi finitum summo Graecine Decembri
Imperium Jani suscipit ille die.
And in Fastorum l. 1.
another Place,

Jamque novi praeeunt fasces, nova purpura fulget,
Et nova conspicuum purpura sentit Ebur.

in their Office.
Year; though some think 'twas more than the Common Year; and although the
Roman People conferred upon Africanus a continual Consulate; yet some Examples
break not a General Rule: For the Consulate, (as say Lib. de Ira, c. ult.
Seneca) was an Annual Honor; or as L. de Patien. in sine.
Tertullian has it, the fleeting Joy of one Year.

. 6. There were ordinarily two Consuls, extraordinarily Of the number of
Consuls that yearly praesided over the Roman People.
sometimes more, one of the two dying, or being removed at the Pleasure of the
Caesar's: For thus Julius Obsequens speaks of those that were removed; It Is
evident that no one that had taken away the Office of his Colleague lived a
Year. And In vit. Commodi.
Lampridius, speaking of those that were unduly elected, says, For then 1st
there were 25 Consuls chosen for one Year, all the Provinces were sold, etc.
And of Extraordinary Consuls Seneca thus writes; He made me a Consul, but not
an ordinary one, etc. Also Suetonius In Domit.
in six Consulates he had but one that was Ordinary. And Suetonius seems to
refer to this in his Observations of the Emp. Augustus, he also required that
so often as a Consulate was given to him, he should have two Colleagues: And
adds, Yet all crying out against him, he could not obtain that the Majesty
should be lessened; because he bore that Honor not himself alone, but in
Conjunction with the other.

. 7. Those that anciently wrote of the Roman Of the Certainty that may be
attained from the Series of Consuls, and the Signature of the Times.
Affairs, were wont to note diligently that there were two Consuls, which acted
for the space of four Years, as is evident from Cuspini^nus's Monument, which
four Years they called Chronica Consularia; but we cannot be so happy as to
consult these Consularia of the Consuls, since time has wholly destroyed these
ancient Writings, or miserably defaced 'em: but it is thus that Dionys. Dio
Livius, etc.
some would make good this Defect: And first of all, the Capitoline Marbles
discovered in the last Age conduce much toward it: For in the Year of Christ
1547, (as Caivisius has it, the Capitoline Tables written formerly out of the
Minutes of the Senate by Verrius Flaccus the Grammarian, and publicly set up
in the Roman Forum by the Command of the Emperor Augustus; and afterward being
broken in pieces, and dispersed by the Injury of Times, were lost and covered
under Ground; by which ancient Guides (found afterward again) very many
Antiquaries have endeavored to correct the Roman Fasti or Calendars; but no
one has been more successful in those Enquiries than Onuphrius, an Acquaintance
of the Cardinal Alexander Farnesius, to whom these Tables were brought when
first found: For he afterward published at Venice the Roman Calendars and
Triumphs, from the time of Romulus, till that of Charles V. in the Year 1557;
yet the Alexandrian Chronicle is not to be wholly neglected, which carries the
Name of the Sicilian Calendars: For this Book having been taken from amongst
the most ancient Writings, was first found in Sicily, being part of the ancient
Library of Jerone Surita, and sometimes ^^ted by Scaliger and Causabon. This
Book Antonius Augustinus (Auditor rotae) first brought with him into Italy: Fr.
Sylburgius bought it for six Pieces of Gold, and gave it to Heschelius, who
brought it to the Augustine Bibliotheque; from whence it was published by
Matthew. Raderus.

. 8. Some suspect that a Lustrum of 4 Pairs That all the Pairs of Consuls for
every year since the first Insti^ution of the Consulate answering to the
Monuments of Antiquity already cited, do not at this Day appear, nor are now
known.
and consequently of 4 Years, was observed in the Roman Calendars; for many
Years are wont to be reckoned from the Solemnity of the Consuls; which we have
already remarked, were 2. This Defect, it seems, has given the best Writers
much Trouble: For, first of all, there are some who think that either the Names
of some Consuls were lost, or that there were Dictators put in the room of
Consuls; or that a Quadrennium (or Space of Four Years) was managed without
Consuls; which Opinion, not to mention other Difficulties, seems to labor
under this, viz. That it does not sufficiently appear in what place the new
Pairs of Consuls were inserted. Also the Government of Dictators was
half-yearly, nor decreed but by the Consuls: There are some in the second place
that guess, the Order of Consuls had respect to the Years of the City. I always
suspected, and I think not without Grounds (says Onuphrius) that four Years
were inserted in the Calendars, either of Dictators without Consuls, or without
either Dictators or Consuls; because Livius, who wrote the History of those
Times; found no such thing in the Annals whence he made his History. Therefore
I sometimes thought that they fixed the Building of Rome with C. Fabius Pictor
in the 29th of the Olympiads, That the Order of Consuls might answer to the
Years of the City. But it seems not safe to contradict the unanimous Consent of
the best Writers. Thirdly and Lastly, There are some who seem, not without
Grounds, to suspect that from the very corrupt Disposition of the Romulian and
Pompilian Year; and because the Consuls at that time did enter upon their
Office. Therefore these Doubts have arisen.

Scilicet arma magis quam sydera, Romu'e, noras,
Curaque finitimos vincere major erat,
. 9. And as 'twas said before that there were What it is we ought to think of
their Opinion, who are yet persuaded that there were five Pair of Consuls in
the Consular Calendar.
four Pair of Consuls, so we have J^annes Georgius Herwart ab Hohenburg, Auster
Novae, ver^, and exact ad Calculum Astronomicum revocatae Chron* ^.
some that will have the same Calendars to abound with Five Pair of Consuls:
But since, what this Author has advanced, as any one may read him if they think
it worth the while, is repugnant to Universal History; and if his Hypothesis
were admitted, it would rather disturb Chronology, than bring any Light unto
it: Besides, the same Authorities he makes use of to advance his Hypothesis, he
rejects them in other Places: Therefore we also shall reject all that he has
said upon this Matter.

. 10. The Consuls were marked in the Of the time that the Dignity of a
Consulate was in use amongst the Romans.
Calendars till the Year of Christ 541; but after Julius Caesar, as he himself
speaks, Rome had only the Shadow of a Commonwealth, and only the Names of
Consuls were retained: For then indeed,

Omnia Caesar erat.

For what betwixt the Affection of Popularity, and (mostly) by the Counsel of
their Authority, the Caesar's drew the Consulate to themselves, sometimes using
Force in it. For so Suetonius remarks of his Augustus in these Words; In the
twentieth Year of his Age he invaded the Consulate, moving his Legions after an
hostile manner toward the City; and having sent an Embassy to treat for him in
the Name of the Army; whilst the Senate delayed, Cornelius Centurio the Chief
of the Embassy throwing open his Cloak, showed him the Head of his Sword, and
was not afraid to speak in the Court, If you will not do it, this shall do it.
At length, on the 15th Year of Justinian, in which only Basilius was Consul,
this Order of Consuls was wholly extinguished; and after this Year, for 25 of
the following Years they wrote thus: After the 1st, 2 d, 3 d, etc. Years of the
Consulate of Basilius. Thus the Character of the Consuls fell, and the Times in
the Roman Affairs were noted with the Years of the Emperors, and a little after
with the Years of Christ.

. 11. Custom at last obtained, that upon the The Reason why Justinian the
Emperor to^k away the Dignity of the Consulate from the Senate.
1st Day of the Consulate, the new Consuls were used to excessive Expenses;
Caesar, therefore as appears from the 105th Novella, endeavored to restrain
them by a certain Law, in which he not only forbid that they should throw Gold
about, but in general* that they should not do any thing so immense and
irregular: But when the Consuls again ambitiously violated these Limits, the
Emperor prescribed, so that upon this Account they often ruined their Families,
and reduced them to extreme Necessity the Consular Dignity was taken away from
the Senate: after that the Name of the Consuls, which had almost continued 1000
Years, was extirpated, and the Republic of Rome began to fail, as Justinian
speaks in the Novella above cited.

CHAP. I. Of the Period of Calippus. DEFINITIONS.
1. The Calippic Period is a System of 76 years as well Lunar as Solar; which
being elapsed, the Reckoning of the Solar and Lunar Motion recurrs, as at
first, the Ancients thought that when this Period was finished, the
Conjunctions of the Sun and Moon happened again upon the same Day of the Solar as
they were observed to have done before. 2. This Sum of Years arises by the
Multiplication of 19 (the Metonic Cycle) into 4. 3. This Calippic Period
comprehends 58 Common Years, and 28 intercalatory Ones, 940 Lunations, and
27759 Days.
. 1. THE Greeks being advised by their Of the Reason and Occasion of the

Oracle that they ought to sacrifice as well by Lunae-Solar Times, as by Days,
Months and Years, after various manners of Cycles, as that of 2, 4, 8, 12,
Years space; in which they committed great Mistakes, the Moon, (as we have it
in Aristophanes) complaining out of the Clouds that the Athenians had no
consideration to the Lunar Motions: At length Meto thought of the 19 years
Cycle, and published the same at Athens in the 86th year of the 4th Olympiad;
so that the Metonic Cycle was in the 1st year of the 87th Olympiad, or the
4282d. of the Julian Period. Of him Diod. Sic. thus writes, That when Bosphorus
K. of the Spartans was dead, and Seleucus, who reigned only four years,
succeeded him, there was one Meto, Brother of Pausanias at Athens, famous for
Astronomy; who on the 13th day of Scirrophorion (an Attic Month) published his
Enneadecaterides; for in so many years the Stars return to the same Places, and
as it were, finish a great Year: Therefore this Year is by some called Meto's
Year; for that Man seems to have followed the Truth in this Prediction and
Description: For the Stars have their Motions and Significations answerable to
this Description: So that very many of the Greeks who follow this Account, even
to this time seem not to have erred. But since the Observations of succeeding
Times have sufficiently showed us that this Metonic Cycle does not exactly
answer to the Lunae-Solar Motions. Calippus endeavored to reform it by a new
Period, subtracting one Day from every 4 Cycles.

by the Ancients, not Cygicenus, as it is read in Josephus Blancanus's
Chronology of famous Mathematicians. Yet though this Period had its Name from
Calippus, yet it is without doubt, but Timcchares, Aristellus, Polemarchus, who
all flourished about that time, consulted the Author of this System; and
whereas we read that he came with Polemarchus to Aristotle at Athens upon
Account of some Opinions of Eudoxus, Aristotle in his 62d Metaph. Text. 47.
makes mention of this Calippus.

18 times in the space of 76 Years; but upon what Account, and in what time he
has inserted those Months, would seem difficult, if Geminus had not noted that
Calippus in his new Period had changed nothing in the computing of
Intercalation in the Metonic Cycle: From whose Testimony we gather that
Calippus intercalated so often as Meto's Cycle required: But we have above
showed that Meto's Intercalatory Years were 3. 6. 8. 11. 14. 17. 19. Moreover,
the first Year of the Calippic Period was the 8th in the Metonic Cycle, which
we gather from the space of 102 Years, betwixt the Beginning of Meto's Cycle
(in the Year of the Julian Period 4282) and the Calippic Period (in the Year of
the Julian Period 4384:) Therefore it seems probable to us that the
intercalatory Years of the Calippic Period were these following: 1. 4. 7. 10.
12. 15. 18. 20. 23. 26. 29. 31. 34. 37. 39. 42. 45. 48. 50. 53. 56. 58. 61. 64.

less than another by above 18 H. But that the Examination of the Cycles and
Lunae-Solar Periods may be liable to less Difficulties, we have thought fit to
construct the following Tables, whose Use is very great and obvious.

CHAP. II. Of the Period of Hipparchus.
1. Hipparchus 's Period is a System of 304 years Lunar and Solar, which being
elapsed, the Ancients thought the Reckoning by the Lunar Motion would exactly
coincide again with the Solar ones. 2. This Period comprehends 3760 Months, and
111035 Days. 3. The Sum of these Days arises from the Multiplication of the
Calippic Period, viz. 27759 into 4, subtracting Unity from the Product.

Nicaea in Bithynia, (according to Strabo) or the Island of Rhodes (according to
Ptolemy;) and he made such Proficiency in Astronomy, that Lib. 2. c. 26.
Pliny says of him, Nunquam satis landatus. But whether this was the same with

Lucas Gauricus and Josephus Blancanus thought, you may read Clavius's Vide

fixed from his own Observations; for he takes notice of a Vernal Aequinox in
the 3d Year of the 150th Olympiad, that it happened upon the 30th of Messori,
which is October the 3d. of the Jul. Period 4552; and on the following Years he
gives us other Observations; whereof Ptolemy mentions 8; and the difference
betwixt the first and the last, is 3^ Years: Therefore he flourished in the
time of the third Punic War; and he gave himself up to this Study from the Year
4552, to the Year 4586, according to the Julian Account; in which time it is
indisputable but he must have fixed his Period.

. 3. He found that the Period of Calippus Of the Reason why Hipparchus
corrected the Calippic Period.
was assumed too great by near a Quarter of an Hour; so that 4 Periods being
elapsed, the Moon would come to the old Place again in the Solar Calendar, if
one Day were subtracted; which he accordingly did. Of this Affair Longomontanus
Danic. Theor. l. 1. c. 2. p. 175.
thus writes: Meto in 304, which happened nearly betwixt him and Hipparchus, had
committed an Error of 5 Days, in his Cycle then, because he looked upon the
Solar Year to be almost 365 Days; because he found the Conjunction of the Sun
and Moon not so precise as it should be, which Calippus thought of, whilst
examining an Eclipse of the Moon 6 years before the Death of Alexander the
Great; So that he corrected Meto, subtracting one Day in every 4 Cycles; from
whence he made his own Period of 76 Years: But whereas Calippus himself had
usurped, that the Solar Year consisted of 365 Days; and also in the Course of
the Moon it lost something. Therefore Hipparchus in like manner corrected
Calippus, taking from him in 4 Periods or the space of 304 Years, one whole
Day, and consequently 5 from Meto in that time. But this Error of one Day
committed by Calippus, Hipparchus rejected for a whole Solar Year, subtracting
only so much after 304 years and one Day altogether in 304 years. Hence it
comes to pass that the Measure of the Tropic Year 365 Days is lessened by
Hipparchus by the 300th part of one Day; that is, 4. 48: So that time should,
according to him, be thought but 365 D. 5 H. 55. 12.

evident Disparity, and the Error is owing to this, that the Quantity of the

require.

. 5. The Gregorian Hypothesis is this, that That the Authors of the Gregorian
Calendar have not rightly corrected the Fault of Hipparchus* Period.
the Sun and Moon are not together in the same Place of 304 years as Hipparchus
had taught, but after 312; which Cycle of Years the Gregorian Correctors have
substituted instead of that of Hipparchus, hereby acting absurdly two ways:
First, the Authors of this Cyclic Method have taken away from this Lunar Cycle
worse than any before them and without any reason have deduced their Reckoning
rather from Cycles than Computation: 2dly, nor have they rightly observed the
Laws of the Celestial Motions; for which way soever you calculate, you shall
never make 312 Solar Years, and 312 Lunar Years, that they should exactly
coincide with a constant perpetual Revolution.

. 6. Those who undertake to correct the How the Errors of the Ancients have
been corrected by Lunae-Solar Calculations.
Lunae-Solar Cycles and other Periods of the same nature, seem to me not very
unlike those who take up Water in a Sieve; for both of 'em lose their Labor:
We cannot successfully find the Lunae-Solar Morions except by Tables built upon
Celestial Observations, whereby we fully know the Times of the Aequinoxes, the
Varieties of the Lunar Phases, coming this way only to the Archives of the
Stars; when those that have declined this way, and endeavoring to substitute
another Period in the room of that of Hipparchus, could never have another
Recompense, but Errors for their Errors: So that the Pope himself was once
amazed when he saw the Jews, the Slayers of Christ, his Colleagues in the
Paschal. So that Christophorus Clavius was compelled to write, to the Eternal
Infamy of the reformed and ancient Periods: Demonstrandum erit Maestlino in
Kal. Greg. alios errores praeter quatuor reperi. Oh the Folly of the Age! Pray,
how many Full Moons, Paschals (for 'twas for their sakes that so much Pains
were taken, partly in mending, partly in constituting anew the Periods of the
Ancients) could those little Parasites, while they were nourished 10 Years at
Rome by Gregory, be able to compute with a little diligence for the Tables of
Celestial Motions, without the use of fallacious Cycles and Periods! So that
they were able to avoid many Errors, of which Clement VIII. wrote foolishly
enough, when he said, vitari non potuerint. In short, there is no Cycle, no
Period, however ingeniously contrived, which we can pronounce sufficient to
reconcile the Motions of the Sun and Moon by an accurate, useful and perpetual
Agreement.

CHAP. III. Of the Victorian Period.
1. The Victorian Period is a System of 532 Lunae-Solar and Julian Years, which
being elapsed, the Characters of the Moon fall again upon the same Day and
Feria, and revolve in the same Order, according to the Opinion of the Ancients.
2. It Is otherwise the great Paschal Cycle; because the Christians first used it
to find the true time of the Pascha's. 3. But the Sum of these Years arises
from the Multiplication of 29 into 28, the Numbers of the Lunar and Solar
Cycle.
. 1. THOUGH there were many Victorius's by Name, as Victorius Pictaviensis, who

suffered Martyrdom under Dioclesian, and another about the Year of Christ 324,
who in a Roman Synod met in Trajan's Baths, was condemned because he presumed
to argue about the Paschal Cycles received into the Church: But the Learned
agree, that one Victorius different from the former, and by Nation, and
Aquitane, was the Author of the Cycle of 532 Years. Theophilus and C. Cyrillus
computed the times of the Pascha's for only 95 Years: For Dionysius Exiguus
remarks upon both, and wrote thus to Petronius the Bishop: That Pope Theophilus
dedicating a Course of 100 Years to Prince Theodosius the Elder, and S.
Cyrillus composing a Cycle of Times for 95 Years, both kept in all things this
Tradition of the holy Council, to observe the 14 Paschal Moons. When therefore
Hilary I. Archdeacon, after Pontifex R. had observed that those Particulars
were found out, and that the Table of Theophilus Alexandrinus was almost at an
End, he commanded Victorius, who at that time was looked upon as the best
Computator of the Age, to assist the Church in this Necessity; who for this
substituted the Period I have described, that the same being elapsed, the
Feriae and Conjunctions might return and happen again upon the same Day.

. 2. 'Twas before Hilarious received the Pontificate Of the time of publishing
this Period.
that Victorius had his Command about this Cycle, which is gathered from an
Epistle of Hilarious to Victorius; which, it is said, is now extant in the
Sirmondian Codex, which has this Inscription: Dilectissimo, etc. To the most
beloved, honorable and holy Brother Victorius, Hilarious, Bishop and
Archdeacon of the City of Rome, etc. But till some Years were clapsed, and
Hilarious made Pope, this Cycle was not published; as appears from the Prologue
written to the same Pope: Domino, etc. To Hilarious the truly Holy Lord and
Pope, venerable in Christ, Bishop of the City of Rome, Victorius, etc. Marianus
Scotus speaks the clearest of this Matter, who upon the Year 463, writes the
following Words: Victorius upon the Command of P. Hilary wrote the Paschal
Cycle of 532 Years.

time he first discovered it, but from the Passion of Christ, which he makes to
be in the Year of the Consulate of Ruffus and Rebellius, which Character seems
to agree with the 29th Year of the common Era.

. 4. Yet the Annals of the Ancients witness, How victorius's Period was
accepted.
that Victor, a Bishop of Capua, wrote against the Faults of the Victorian
Cycle; and Beda seems to take his part against Victorius. But how Victorius was
mistaken, is not so evident to us, since we find no Copy at this Day of his
Cyde; for that Fragment which Petavius De Doctrina Temp. Lib. 2. Cap. 67.
cites, he himself thinks spurious. But this is certain, that Dionysius Exiguus
upon the Occasion of Victorius's Period found out a more accurate and newer
Paschal Cycle, viz. of 525 Years: Who desires to see more of these, may consult

CHAP. IV. Of the Constantinopolitan Period.
1. The Constantinopolitan Period is a System of 7980 Julian Years, whereof the
first has the Solar Cycle of 28 Years, the 2 d the Lunar of 19 Years, the 3 d
the Indiction of 15 Years. 2. This Sum arises from the continual Multiplication
of the Number of Years in the Solar Cycle, Lunar Cycle and Indiction. 3. The
Greeks do not reckon the same Cycles as the Romans do. 4. The first Solar Cycle
of the Greeks is the 18th of the Latins, and the 1st of the Latins is the
12th of the Greeks. 5. The 1st Lunar Cycle of the Greeks is the 4th of the
Latins, and the 1st of the Latins is the 17th of the Greeks. 6. But for the
most part, they reckon the Cycle of the Indictions as the Romans do: For what
Number the Greeks give to the Cycle of Indictions from the Calends of
September, the same the Romans give from the Calends of January.
. 1. Although we dare not assert with Josephus Lib. 5. de Emend. Temp. p. 363.
Scaliger that the Constantinopolitan Of the Original of the common Grecian
Era, and in what sense the Greeks understood it.
Computation was a Period merely artificial, which the Unlearned that followed,
fetched from the Creation of the World with the same Unskillfulness as the Jews
do their Reckoning; Yet the Number of the Greek Version of the 70 Interpreters
do very nearly agree with this Era: Nor has it been denied by L. 9. de doct.
Temp.
Petavius, that this was the Reason of preferring the Convenience of certain
Cycles, chiefly that of the Moon and Indictions, to others, which were to be
interpolated by the Greeks, and that especially which we now use; which Cycles
that they might commodiously agree, the Greeks studied to follow Panodorus
Monachus, or some other Author; by a Subtraction or an Addition of a few Years
to that old and well-known Sum: So that nothing hinders why we should less call
that Computation a Period which the Greeks call by the Name of an Epoch or
Era (the Commodity and Disposition of the Cycles in the Computation being
considered) for by that Name (viz. Period) we take notice that not only
Scaliger, but also Langins and others used to call that Computation, though 'twas
afterward opposed by Petavius.

Sun and Moon from April. Hence the Computations of these years divided by the
Cycle of the Sun and Moon, are to be lessened by Unity in the former Months,

Argyrus, it is gathered that the first Year of the vulgar Era began on the 4th
Month of the Year 5509; whence it is evident that betwixt the beginning of this
Epoch, and that of the vulgar Era, there were 5508 Years and 4 Months, which,
if added to the Year of the Christian Era, it shows the time according to the
Greek Account; or if subtracted from the time of the Constantinopolitans, it
shows the time answering to our vulgar Computation: so that there is no use of

. 6. Although at this Day many of the Greeks make use of this Era; yet there
are others especially amongst the ancient Writers, that use another Epoch
different from this; whence Jacobus In Epocham illustrium them it
Capellus reckons upon diverse Aera's which are distinctly made use of by the
Greek Writers. The first is, if you look back to the Creation of the World,
according to the Reckoning of the Latins, the Constantinopolitan Reckoning
just now explained, will be found false: The 2d is the Graec. Era, used by the
Aethiopians, which begins the 9th Year from the Alexandrian or
Constantinopolitan Era upon the 9th Indiction, and the 26th Julian Solar
Cycle, and commences upon the Autumn: The third also is a Grecian Era
frequently used by Cedrenus. He deduces it from the 16th year of the
Alexandrian Epoch, the 8th of the Ethiopian, and from the first Indiction:
The fourth is that which Maximus Monachus usurps, and is deduced from the 17th
Year current of the common Grecian Era; for betwixt the Epoch of the World's
Creation, and the Year of Christ, Miximus reckons 5492 Years. Petavius reckons
up the Varieties of the Greek Computations after another manner, who in respect
to Dionysius's Christian Era, admits only two Aera's of the Greeks, whereof
the first makes the Nativity of Christ upon the 5493d Year of his Era; the
other upon the Year H^w the Greek and Latin Cycles may be compared.

. 7. The Latin and Greek Cycles may be compared by Help of the following Table,
which shows the Lunar and Solar Cycles of both: For we have already shown how
the Latin Cycle of Indictions agrees with the Grecian Cycles; to which we may
add that the Grecian Cycles answer to the Latin Cycles till March or April: If
therefore the Character of the following Months in relation to the Solar Cycle
of the Latins, answering to the reckoning of the Greeks be sought, the Tabular
Numbers in the Column Graec. ought to be increased by Unity. Indeed I am not
ignorant that Isaac Monachus wrote that the Year, in respect of the Solar
Cycle, began from October; but in respect of the Lunar Cycle, from the Calends
of Janury; but if we consider the usual Greek Computations, that Method we have
now prescribed, will be more natural.

CHAP. V. Of the Julian Period.
1. The Julian Period is a System of 7980 Years, whose first Year had 1 for the
Character of the Solar Cycle; also of the Lunar Cycle, and also of the
Indiction, all reckoned according to the manner of the Latins, from Noon upon
the Calends of January. 2. This Period arises from the continual Multiplication
of 28, 19, and 15, the Cycles of the Sun, Moon and Indiction. 3. In respect of
its Use, this Period contains in it the Reason of all other Epocha's; so that
we are chiefly to reduce all other Aera's to it.
. 1. THIS Period was not called the Julian, because it was invented by Julius

Caesar, since 'twas not received till the Year 4669; but because this System
consists of Julian Years.

. 2. This Epoch is not Historical but Artificial, Of its Author.
since 'twas invented only for the Use of true Epocha's: For Scaliger
considering that the Calculation was very intricate, since, if we consider the
Years of the Creation, the year of Christ, or any other Epoch whatever,
another Person could not understand what Year this or that Writer meant;
therefore to remove such Doubts about reckoning upon the times, he thought of
this Period; and when he saw that there was no other Epoch, whose Beginning
was incontestable among Chronologers, he fixed this: For he continually
multiplied the three Cycles of the Sun, Moon, and Indiction together, and the
Product resulting he called the Julian Period. By this means, avoiding those
Inconveniences, which were wont to arise from the different Computation of
Years; but no one can doubt, who has considered the 2 Periods, viz. the
Constantinopolitan and the Julian; but that the former was the occasion of the
latter. For they agree in Quantity and in Principles; since, as Scaliger has
taught, both arise from the Multiplication of the Cycles; but they disagree in
respect of the Terminus a quo, since the Beginning of the Constable. Period is
supposed to precede the other Period by 795 years: Nor have the Years of the
Julian Period the same Beginning as the Constable. have; since we begin those from
Noon upon the Calends of January; but these partly from the Autumn, partly from
the Spring. But what Praise Scaliger has deserved, even from his Enemy, because
of the Use of this Julian Period, is evident from the following Words of Lib.
9. Cap. 1.
Petavius, where he says, Truly there is scarce any thing in all Scaliger 's
Chronological Books which is of any Moment, or may avoid Reprehension, besides
his Explication of the Julian Period. And as we have deservedly, condemned the
rest, and because of their intolerable Errors, and have rejected them from all
Use in History; so we ought much to esteem this Artificial Cycle of Year and
its Use. Which is sufficient from an Enemy and constant Adversary.

. 3. The first Use of the Julian Period Of the most remarkable Uses of the
Julian Period.
is this; that we can explain our Minds to one another: For every Year of this
Period has its Cycles; all of which no other Year in the whole Period has. And
on the contrary, the Year of the Creation being stated, we may first enquire
how many years any Author reckons from the Creation to the Year of Christ which
Multiplex Inquisition, Experience will teach any one who doubts of it, is
troublesome and full of Difficulties, according to the Method of other Periods.
The 2d Use is, that the 3 Cycles are found in this Period: The 3d Use is this,
that if it can be found how the Chronological Characters can be found, and that
the Years of any other Epoch can be connected with the years of the Julian
Period, the same Characters also with little Labor may be applied to the years
of all other Epocha's, which also is the Cause why we shall explain in certain
Sections the Invention of the Chronological Characters in the Julian Period,
and afterward in particular, the Connection of Historical Years, with the
Julian Period. For whereas in all other Chapters we have particularly spoken
how those Characters might peculiarly be applied to Aera's: So it shall be
sufficient that we have mentioned how they may be compared together in the
Julian Account; so that it only remains, that in the mention of Epocha's we
only show how all the Years reckoned from any Period agree with some certain
year in the Julian Period.

. 4. The first Year of Dionysius's Christian Of the Principle that Scaliger
followed in instituting the Years of the Julian Period.
Epoch by the consent of all the Latins, had for its Characters 10, the Solar
Cycle: 2. the Lunar, 4. the Roman Indiction; which three Cycles being found in
no other year of the whole Julian Period, besides 4714, the first of the
Christian Era: Therefore this Dionysian Epoch must rightly agree with that
year of the Julian Period, and each with each, as Scaliger noted, and as
Petavius truly wrote: The Beginning of the Years of Christ, which Men call, the
Christian Era is as it were the Limit and Hinge of Chronology, and the common
Term in which the Reasoning of all Chronologers meet, as if they are drawn
through many Turnings and Windings into the same Computation.

beginning An Enquiry whether the System of the Julian Period is sufficient to

of the World, is 764; it easily appears, that the disagreeing Opinions for
many years may commodiously be referred to the Julian Period: Nor is it found
amongst those Writers who reckon from the Hebrew and Latin Codices of Bibles
that ascends the assigned Epoch of the Creation, ascends beyond the beginning
of the Julian Period: But if we examine the Reasons of profane History, and
first of all, of the Egyptian and other Authors, who follow the Numbers of the
70 Interpreters, we cannot deny this Period to be insufficient to reconcile all
the Disagreements that happen about the Epoch of all the World's Creation till
Abraham, the Computation of the Greeks exceeds that of the Latins by more than
a thousand years, as shall be showed in its Place; for which reason, besides
that we now mentioned, we call the Julian Period Postulatitious; by means
whereof we can commodiously explain those Opinions which differ so much from
the Hebrew Truth.

ways: The first is this; The Number of the years of the Solar Cycle being
given, subtract from them those of the Lunar (adding 28, if the Subtraction
cannot be made with it), multiply the Difference by 56: Again, take the Sum of
this Product, and that Number from which the Subtraction was made, and by 532,

Period, the difference betwixt this year, and that of the given Indiction
divided by 15, and the Remainder multiplied by 1064; the Sum of the Product of
the Victorian year found as above (if not exceeding 7980, the Quantity of the
Julian Period) will give the year sought.

against the Sum under the Title Indict. is the Year of the Julian Period fought.

Period.
this System does abundantly compensate for any Difficulty that can occur, and
that nothing could be more proper to remove the intricate Perplexities of
Chronologers than an Observance of the clear Disposition and evident Reasons of
its Characters, yet there is one thing we cannot pass by; that if any Person is
not pleased with the Use of this Period, he may more commodiously use the
Dionysian Era of Christ, with the years before it began than any other Epoch
whatever: For although (a) Petavius concludes, Ca^ebit; qui hanc Periodum
omit^et, praesenti illius fructus, ut per singulorum tri^n Cyclorum ^^^^^^ulus
divisi annorum numeri Cyclos little proprios exhibeant. But this Difficulty may
be removed if one will observe that these Numbers 9, 1, 3, are to be added to
the year of Christ forwards, and the Sums to be divided by 28, 19, 15. But if
the years should happen to be before Christ; then let the Sums be divided by
the Numbers 28, 19, 5, and subtract the Remainders from 10, 2, 4, assuming
Circles as often as is necessary, we have the Characters answering to the year
before Christ's Nativity. For Example; to the year of Christ add 4713; or from
the year before Christ subtract 4714, the Sum or Difference gives the
corresponding year in the Julian Period.

begin not as the Julian do; (for we reckon these from 120, a-clock on the

two years of the Julian Period, with the first in respect of the 3 Months, the
latter in respect of 9. This premised, note that to all the year of the Julian
Period, considered in respect of the 9, we are to add 6, and divide the Sum by
7, and the Remainder is either^o, and then 't^s a Sabbatic year; if any, it is
the Cycle of the Sabbatic year belonging to the year given: But if the same
Character be sought in respect of the latter Months of the Julias year, omit
the Addition of 6, and let the given Sum of years be divided by 7, and you have
it as before. But the Rule of Scaliger in this J^l. Isag. p. 9.
Affair is this; All the Sevens of the Solar Cycle are the 7th Years of the
Week; And therefore what year soever shall happen after the next 7 of the Solar
Cycle, that is the first year of the legal Week, etc. is to be understood of
the years of the Julian Period, considered not in respect of the former but
latter Months.

in the Julian Period may seem intricate, since the Quantity of the mystic
Jubilean year has nothing common with the Quantity of the Julian; yet we shall

and it is that whereby we found before the Character of the Sabbatic Cycle;
Therefore to any years of the Julian Period considered here in respect of the

Jubilean year; or else 1, 2. 3, when it shall determine that year in the
Jubilean, which the remaining Number expresses.

fixed; and they relate of Sosygenes, that he thought that neither in his nor
succeeding Ages, the Winter Solstices could happen but upon the Calends of
January. Thus also the Fathers in the Nicene Council, that the Vernal Aequinox
could not recede from the 20th or 21st of March; but the Event shows that both
were deceived: For it is now evident that the Winter Solstice, with the other
Cardinal Times have fallen otherwise.

ways, were wont to think of a Method how to find the time of the Aequinoxes
and Solstices; yet we doubt not but ours which follows is most compendious,
easy, certain, and accommodated to Chronological Calculations. The Foundation
of it, and first of all of the Table, by whose Help the Computation is
performed, is twofold: First, it is evident that Tycho Brahe at Ween in the year
of Christ 1584, observed the Vernal Aequinox on March the 9th, 21 H. 30 M.
Afternoon; and that the same Day of Observation was on a Bissextile, 70 D. from
the Calends of January; in like manner in the following year 1585, he observed
the Vernal Aequinox to happen on the 10th day of March, 3 H. 19 M. and in the
year 1586, March 10th, 9 H. 8 M. Secondly, L. 1. Theor. c. 5.
Longemontanus thus determined the Quantity of the Tropic Year: The Quantity of

whose Use is this: At the complete given Year of the Julian Period in which the
time of the Vernal Aequinox is sought; take out the Numbers of Anticipation,
and subtract them from a Radix answering to the current year, the time of the
Vernal Aequinox is known, reckoned from Noonday at Ween.

is the time of the Winter Solstice, where you must note that in both the
present and following Ages the Winter Solstice does not fall upon the
mentioned, but the preceding year; and therefore that a Subtraction may be
made, the Days of the preceding year, or at least, of the last Month, are to be
added to the Sum from whence you subtract; but if 93 D. 9 H. 15 M. be added to
the time of the same Vernal Aequinox, the time of the Summer Solstice is had;

World, or that of Christ; and therefore are not universal: Ours shall be
fitted to the years of the Julian Period; whereby we can apply all
Chronological Characters to all times. The Use of the Tables constructed for
this end, is this; Let there be taken out under the Title Rad. P. Jul. the
complete time proposed, and let the corresponding Motions of the Moon's
Longitude be added thereto, computing 60 Minutes to a Degree, 30 Degrees to a
Sign, and 12 Signs to a Circle or one whole Period. If then the N. Moon of any
Month is sought, subtract the above Addition from 12 Signs or 360 Days; but if
a F. Moon, then from six Signs, assuming a whole Circle to make the Subtraction
possible, if need be; if nothing remains, the Character of the Moon's
Conjunction which is sought, falls upon the end of the preceding Month; if any
thing remains, and that Remainder be 12 D. 11 27, (in which case one Day's
Addition is necessary,) or if greater, enter the 4th Table therewith, which is
constructed for Days, and there seek the Remainder, which if it answers
exactly, it is done; if not, take the next less and subtract; with the
difference enter the 5th Table of Hours, and if need be, proceed to Minutes and
Seconds. The Sum of all which, is the time to be reckoned from 12 a-clock at
Vranburg, the beginning of the Month Current: If for other Places, the
difference of Longitude in time must be added or subtracted. But you are to
note, 1st, That if the proposed Month be not January, you must first work for
the Solar Cycle of the given Year, by which you may know whether these Motions
being taken out, belong to a Bissextile or common Year. 2dly, The N. Moon of
one Month being known, that of the next is also known, by adding 29 D. 12 H. 44
Min. or of the preceding, by subtracting so much; Wherefore if you take the
time of the N. Moon, and want the time of the following F. Moon, add 14 D. 18
H. 22. to the time of the N. Moon; or if by the given F. Moon you would seek
out the N. Moon preceding, subtract the same Sum from the known time of the F.
Moon; and from hence the Conjunction of the Luminaries being known for any one
Month of the Julian Year, they are easily found for any other; and for this the
Table Lib. 3. C. 1. will be useful.

under the Title Radix P. Jul. take out the corresponding Numbers under Motus
Latitudinis Lunae, and let the Numbers thus found be added together; and let
the Signs multiplied by 30 be changed into Degrees and added to the rest if
any. Further, note that by frequent Observations Astronomers gather, that the
Solar Eclipses happen, when in the time of the N. Moon the mean Motion of the
Moon's Latitude is under 12 D. or above 168 D. and below 192 D. or above 348 D.
also the Lunar Eclipses do happen when in the time of the Full Moon the mean
Motion of the Moon's Latitude is below 17 D. 30. or above 162 D. 30. and below
197 D. 30. or above 342 D. 30. And although these Notes in finding out the
Lunar Eclipses are sufficiently true, yet the Solar are not so certain: For it
may happen, though seldom, (for certain Reasons) that an Occultation wholly, or
(what is more frequent) in a certain Place only, may be hindered; but of this
doubtful Momentous Case let the Astronomer be consulted.

Point in the Equator cannot ascend or descend at the same time every where, it
follows, that it cannot be the same Hour of the Day in all Places at once; but
the Sun will arise sooner toward the Eastern Parts, and later toward the
Western Parts of the World. For Example; if we would compare the Hour of the
Day at Vranburg and Jerusalem together, at which Place the Sun rises first,
there will be more Hours reckoned. Now a good Watch shows the Jews to be 2 H.
16. before the Vranburgers, in the difference of Meridian; but besides the Jews
began their Days different from the Vranburghers, viz. at Sunset, whereas all
Europe else begin their Political Day from Midnight, and the Mathematicians
from Noon; which last Computation being observed here, the Jews are 18H. and 2.

DEFINITIONS.
1 Due Regard is to be had to the Computation of Years, which, according to the
Tenure of the Sacred Writ of the Old Testament, contains 1656 Years to the
Deluge. 2. Neither ought these Intervals of Time to be neglected, which are
transmitted to Posterity by the Profane Histories. 3. From whence it will
appear that by right comparing the Sacred and Profane Histories, there must be
counted 3949 Years, according to the Dionysian or vulgar Era, from the first
beginning of the World to the Birth of Christ. 4. It seems to be very probable,
that by God's special Direction the first Year of the World, was also the first
of the Sabbatic and Jubilean Cycles. 5. The first Day of the World used also to
be fixed in one of the Cardinal Points of the Sun; to wit, either the Aequinox
or Solstice. 6. Both the Holy Scripture and the most Ancient Monuments of
profane History seem to intimate that the Beginning of the first Year of the
World ought to be constituted in Autumn; which has induced us to fix the first
Day of the World in the Autumnal Aequinox. 7. And forasmuch as by the Consent
of the most exact Chronologers, the first Nights immediately after the Creation
of the World were enlightened by one of the principal Lunar Phases, their
Hypothesis ought also to be taken into consideration. 8. Neither ought the
Opinion of some other Chronologers to be neglected, who maintain, that since
the Hebdomadic or Weekly Cycle owes its Offspring to the last Day of the
Mosaic Hexameron, and has thus continued ever since without Interruption to
our time, it may be gathered from thence, that the first Day of the said
Hexameron has likewise been the first Feria. 9. This has induced Scaliger to
affirm, that the World was created in the Year of the Julian Period 764, on the
26th Day of October on the first Feria in the eighth Solar Cycle, and the
fourth Lunar Cycle. 10. Wherefore there being, according to Scaliger 's Ye
investigate the year since the beginning of the Epoch of the World.
Computation, 763 Years and 9 Months difference betwixt the beginning of the
Julian Period and the beginning of the World: If the said Number of Years and
Months be added to the Number of Years of the World, the Product will be
correspondent to the Year and Month of the Julian Period. But if the same be
subtracted from the Julian Period, there remains the time which is counted from
the first beginning of the World.
. 1. NOT only the Gentiles, who according Whether it be impossible to fix this
Epoch upon a certain Foundation.
to the Opinion of Pythagoras, Plato, and some of Aristotle's Followers,
acknowledged neither Beginning nor End of the World; but also some of the
Christian Philosophers, have ridiculed the Chronologers for attempting to
determine any certain Season of the Year, for the Creation of the World looking
upon it as a frivolous Question, and not worth the Enquiry of the Learned, it
being, say they, evident that the Times of the Seasons vary in the World
according to the different Climates. But whilst these Gentlemen pretend to
ridicule the Chronologers, they make themselves ridiculous to all the World:
For though it be undeniable, that pursuant to the Spherical Disposition of the
Terrestrial and Celestial Globes, there must needs be observed at one and the
same time a great Variety of Seasons in different Climates, yet does not that
in the least affect the Chronologers, who without the least respect to the
Season, determine their Times by the Ingress of the Sun into the Cardinal
Points of the Zodiac.

. 2. The Gentiles were as little sollicitous It is not impossible to find out
the time of the Creation of the World.
about the Year it self, as the time of the year, when the World was created:
According to Censorinus, De D. N. c. 21.
Varro did contribute three several Intervals of time; the first from the
beginning of the World to the Deluge (...); the second to the Olympiad (...),
and the third (...). And Ptolemy Lib. 3. magr. Construct.
himself reprehends those, who pretend to determine the true Epoch of the
World.

But the Gentiles are not the people only that exclaim against the Presumption
of the Chronologers, in pretending to remedy an Evil which they look upon as
incurable. There are also not a few among the Christians who consider this Era
no otherwise than the Gordian Knots, not to be dissolved by Human Art. Of this
Opinion are Gabriel Rollenhagius, Gerard John Vossius, Nicolaus Mullerus, and
Dionysius Petavius Ratio temp. part. 2. c. p.
: But among all the rest, no body inveighs so much against the Chronologers
upon this score as Isaac Pierius in his Treatise concerning the Prae-Adamites.

I cannot altogether agree in my Opinion with those who would persuade us that
Scaliger's Epoch of the World is so demonstratively proved as to be past all
Contradiction: Nevertheless, I could on the other hand never find any
Satisfaction in Skepticism. It is therefore my Opinion, (1.) That all the
Characters (alleged as such by Scaliger) are not equally Authentic, some of
them being certain others uncertain. (2.) Among the Characters, that of the
Interval, which we have said to be betwixt the time of the Epoch of the World,
and the Dionysian Era of Christ ought to be preferred before the rest. (3.)
That tho all the Characters of Scaliger are not infallible; yet are they more
certain than those introduced or made use of by his Adversaries. (4.) To
conclude of the Validity of these Characters, they ought to be all taken
together, no Judgment being to be given of all from the Uncertainty of one in
particular.


. 3. There has been as much Dispute among Of the particular Intervals betwixt
the Epoch of the World and the Dionysian Era of Christ.
the Chronologers concerning the true Method and Order of the particular
Intervals, as about the whole Interval it self, betwixt the Epoch of the World
and the Dionysian Era of Christ. I agree with these, who range them in the
following Order:

Hypothesis.
founded upon the Testimony of the Holy Writ, till the time of the Destruction
of the second Temple; and that we have but once called to our Aid the ancient
and true Monuments of profane History; I see no reason why the same should not
carry along with it at least a great Probability. For, granted (what is
objected by some) that a Difference ought to be allowed betwixt the Years and
Days, at the time of the Patriarchs and ours, this does not destroy the whole
Certainty of these Intervals of Years, it being by the Consent of the Learned,
put long ago beyond all Question, that the Years mentioned by Moses in the
first Book of his History, were either Solar or Luna-Solar Years; or, at least,
not much different from the Solar, and consequently from the Julian Year; of
which we shall have occasion to say more hereafter in the Epoch of the Deluge.

. 5. After many Contests arisen concerning The Objection of Isaacus Vossius
examined
the Difference of some Years, Isaacus Vossius has some time ago declared open
War against the whole Body of Chronologers, in his Dissertation published in
the Year 1658, under the following Title; A Dissertation concerning the true
Age of the World; where it is demonstrated that betwixt the time of the
Creation of the World and the Birth of Abraham, there are at least 1440 years
wanting. Not long after this Dissertation, he published his Chronologia Sacra,
as he calls it, where he begins the 32d Chapter with these following Words:
Sometime ago we have made it appear, that according to the vulgar Calculation
there is a Defect of no less than 1440 years from the Beginning of the World
till the time of Moses. Besides which, it is now our Opinion (which appeared
doubtful to us before) that 60 years more ought to be added to the said Sum,
Thara the Father of Abraham being born so many years later. There is therefore
a Defect of Fifteen whole Ages, in the vulgar Calculation, the time from the
beginning of the World till the Death of Moses being computed by the modern
Jews to consist of 2493 years; whereas the true Interval is 3993 years. It will
not be amiss to insert here the Defects in the same Order as they have been set
down in Opposition to the Vulgar Chronology, by Isaacus Vossius.

His Opinion is that, there are wanting,
Years. Betwixt Adam and Seth. 100 Betwixt Seth and Enoc, 100 Betwixt Cainan
and Malaleel, 100 Betwixt Malaleel and Jared, 100 Betwixt Enoch and Methuselah,
100 Betwixt the Deluge and Arphaxad, 10 Betwixt Arphaxad and Cainan, 100
Betwixt Cainan, and Arphaxad, 130 Betwixt Salem and Heber, 100 Betwixt Heber
and Phaleg, 100 Betwixt Phaleg and Ragau, 100 Betwixt Ragau and Serug, 100
Betwixt Serug and Nachor, 100 Betwixt Nachor and Thara, 100 Betwixt Thara and
Abraham, 60 1500

But Vossius does not stop here; but alleges several other Intervals, which he
says, are deficient in the vulgar Chronology: These are the following:

Years. Of the Jews after Joshua, 18 The time of the Servitude of Israel under
Cushan, 8 The Anarchy after the Death of Othoniel,... Their Servitude under the
Moabites, 18 The Anarchy after the Death of Ahud,... Their Servitude under
Jabin, 20 The Anarchy after Deborah,... Their Servitude under the Midianites, ^
The Anarchy after Jair,... The Servitude under the Ammonites, 18 The Anarchy
after the Death of Abdon,... Their Servitude under the Philstines, 4^ The
Anarchy after the Death of Heli, the High Priest, 2^

These and several other Defects are imputed to vulgar Chronology by Isaacus
Vossius; to prove which, he calls to his Aid not only the Authority of the 70
Interpreters, and Josephus, but also the Ancient Monuments of the Egyptians,
Chaldeans, and Chinese; which, he says, are of a much older Date than the
vulgar Epocha's of the World, and that the only way to remove all Difficulties
in this kind for the future, is to add a certain Number of Years to the vulgar
Epoch: We^ can be either so blind as not to see, says he P. 280.
, ^^ whi dare deny, that the most proper and the only w^^ to convince those who
make use of the Authority ^^ Profane History in contradiction of the Sacre^
Writ, is to demonstrate the Truth of the Sacre^ History out of the Annals of
the Gentiles? Brye^ Walton seems to be of the same Opinion with Vossius; for in
the Prolegomena to his Bible printed in London, he declares that the
Computation, according to the Hebrew Text, is not to be relied on; but that in
its stead the 70 Interpreters ought to be consulted. But as we shall have
Occasion to examine the Authority of the Greek Computation in that Chapter of
the Epoch of the Deluge, so as to what has been objected to Chronologers
concerning the newly invocated profane Antiquities, I cannot but give this
seasonable Caution; that it appears to me the most unbecoming a Christian
Philosopher to prefer the fabulous Relations of the Gentiles before the
Authority of the Sacred History. Besides that, Vossius ought to have
considered, that his 15 Ages will fall much short from supplying the Difference
there is betwixt the vulgar Epoch of the World and those of the Chinese and
other Gentiles. Neither can he be ignorant that among the Gentiles themselves
Plutarch and Censorinus, and among the Christians, St. Austin, have many years
ago left it as their Opinion to the World, that the years mentioned in the
Chronologies of the Gentiles are not of the same length with ours.

. 6. But since we have said enough about the Epoch of the World, according to
the Computation What time of the year the World was created.
of the Intervals; the next thing in order which is offered to our
Consideration is, to insert something also concerning the Four Quarters of the
Year. Tacitus relates that the ancient Germans knew no more than of Three
Seasons of the Year: But the Division of the Year into Four Cardinal Quarters
has been received many Ages among most Nations. The Beginning of the Spring is
fixed at the time of the Ingress of the Sun into, of the Summer in, of the
Autumn in, of the Winter in. The Subject of our present Enquiry is, in which of
these Four Cardinal Points the first Day of the World is to be fixed.

There is scarce any body that I know of who has taken upon him to plead for
the Winter in this case, unless it be Lib. 1. c. 3^.
Cluverius, who in his German Antiquities seems to misapply the Word Hyems or
Winter, when he says thus; Quaeritur nunc, qua tempestate initium anni fecerint
Celtae, veris, aestatis, an hyemis principio? Omnino, hyemis credo principio,
ut Aegyptii, Hebraeorumque vetustissimi: Nam id ipsum conditi Aevi fuit initium.

There are also a few Modern Authors who fix the time of the Creation of the
World in the Summer. But both Solinus and Macrobius relate, that this was the
Opinion of the ancient Egyptians. For the Polyhist. c. 35.
first expressly says, that the Egyptian Priests had fixed the first Day of the
World on the 18th of July: And ^n So^^n Scip. l. 1. c. 21.
Macrobius aledges concerning the Egyptians, That as they were the first that
applied themselves to Astronomy, so they had attributed the Lion as the proper
House to the Sun; because, says he, this was considered among them as the
Native Sign of the Sun.

Gerhardus Mercator who (according to the Testimony of Buntingus) was the most
exact Chronologer of his time, follows the Opinion of the Egyptians, in this
Point; because it is related in the History of the Deluge, that the Dove
returned with a green Olive-Leaf on the 17th Day of the 11th Month. Now if it
be allowed that the Olive Tree does not blossom but in May, the Consequence is
plain enough. And if the 11th Month counted from the beginning of the World, be
correspondent to the Month of May, the Month of July must of Necessity have
been the first.

But there are many Eminent Writers, who with equal Passion plead either for
the Spring or Autumn. Among those who set up for Patrons for the Spring, L. 3.
Georg,
Virgil declares himself thus:

Non alios prima crescentis origin Mundi
Illuxisse dies, aliumve habuisse tenorem
Crediderim; Ver illud erat, Ver magnus agebat
Orbis, and hybernis parcebant Flatibus Euri.
Of the same Opinion are Eusebius, S. Ambrose, S. Cyril, S. Austin, Beda,
Melancton, Bucholzerus, Buntingus, Cedomannus, Keplerus, Kratzhemius,
Mercerius, A^stadius, Spondanus, Capellus, Edward Simpson and William Lange; as
also Scaliger, at first, besides the Armenians, Persians, and most other
Eastern Countries, who all begin their Computation with the Spring.

But those that have declared for the Autumnal Quarter, are not Inferior in
Authority to the others. Those who at present occur to my Memory, are, Ezec. c.
1.
S. Jerome, Nicolaus Lyra, almost all the Jewish Writers, but especially
Josephus L. 1. an^ c. 4.
, Menasseh ben Israel Con p 18^.
, who cites a great Number of his own Countrymen, Alphonsus Testatus,
Torniellus, Scaliger, Petavius, Helvicus, Bhemius, Maestlinus, Vobo Emmius,
Calvisius, Philippus, Cinverius, Jacobus Vsserius, Joannes Temporarius,
Hainlinus, Helwigius, all the Russians and other modern Nations; to which
Opinion we also subscribe.

. 7. And we will allege here in short the Arguments Reasons elledged f^r (...)
Assertion.
which commonly are, or may be made use of for the Confirmation of this
Opinion; among which are some of the Rabbi's, which contain more Vanity than
Certainty. (1.) Because the Patriarchs in most ancient times always began the
Year in Autumn, and that therefore the Jews would not without an express
Command begin their Ecclesiastical Year in the Month of Nisan. (2.) Because the
Time of gathering the Fruits of the Earth (which without doubt was in Autumn in
Palestine) is called the Revolution of the Year in the Holy Scripture. (3.)
Because it is said Exodus 23. c. 16. 34. c. 22.
that the Deluge began in the second Month, to wit, in respect of the Years
from the beginning of the World. And the same is mentioned by L. 1. c. 4.
Josephus, to have been Marchesvan, or the second in Autumn. (4.) Because the
Sabbatic and Jubilean Years began in Autumn, which being instituted for to let
the Grounds rest during that time, this Ordination of God would appear not so
suitable if the Creation of the World had begun in the Spring. (5.) Because the
Day of Expiation to be celebrated on the 10th Day of the Month Tisri seems to
be instituted in Remembrance of the Fall of Adam: But if Adam's Fall did happen
in Autumn, consequently the Creation of the World began about the same time.
(6.) Because according to the most ancient Institution of the Jews, the Story
of the Creation of the World was to be read in the same Month Tisri. (7.)
Because the In 3 Reg. 8. v^a. 2.
Chaldean Interpreter asserts that the first Autumnal Month has also been the
first of the World. (8.) Because there seems to be the same Relation betwixt
Darkness and Light as there is betwixt Autumn and the other Seasons of the
Year: But Darkness was before Light, and by consequence Autumn before the rest.
(9.) Because it is said of the Trees, That they contained their Seed within
them, which seems not to be so congruously applied to the Spring as to the
Autumn. (10.) Because Rabbi Eliezer and some other Jews by transposing the
first Word of Genesis, interpret it thus according to their Cabbala.


. 8. Dionysius Petavius affirms, that God commenced Whether the World was
created about the time of the N. Moon.
the great Work of Creation in the year of the Julian Period 730, on the 20th
day of October on the first Feria; and that the Moon was at the full on the
27th of October, on the second Feria some Hours after Midnight, and that
consequently on the fourth day, being the 29th of October, when the Moon was
created it appeared somewhat in its Decrease. But it appears more probable to
me, that the World, or at least the great Luminaries were created about the New
Moon: so that our first Parents saw the Moon Cornicular before the first
Quarter, and thus increasing till the Full Moon; whereas if it be supposed that
the Creation of the World was begun in the Full Moon, they must have seen the
Moon first in its Decrease, and afterward in its Increase, and consequently in
its retrograde Course.

. 9. The Arguments arising among the Chronologers Of the difference among the
Chronologers concerning the Lunae-Solar Characters.
concerning the Lunae-Solar Characters at the time of the Creation of the World
may conveniently be divided into several Classes: For there are some who
altogether reject the Consideration of these Characters, among whom one of the
chiefest is the Author of the Mystical Chronology. There are secondly, not a
few who fix these Characters depending on the Motion of the Sun and Moon, (a)
De Doctr. Temp l. 9. c. 6.
on the first Day of the Mosaic Hexaemeron, being of Opinion that on the same
day when the Work of Creation was begun, both these great Luminaries did enter
into one certain Cardinal Point of the Sphere; of which Opinion is also
Dionysius De Doctr. Temp. l. 9. c. 6.
Petavius. The Third Classis consists of such as appoint the Fourth Day of the
Creation to the Aequinox and principal Lunar Phasis, this being the Time when
God created the great Luminaries. Some, says Jacobus Capellus, begin this Time
of the N. Moon and the Aequinox on the first Feria, when the Light was created.
But it appears to me more probable that they ought to begin on the 4th Feria,
when the Sun was created. Michael Moestlinus and Laurentius Codomannus are
constant Adherers to the same Opinion. In the fourth place, there are also some
who appropriate these Characters to the first Day of the second Week; of which
Opinion are In Can. Chron.
Vbbo Emmius and L. 5. emend. Temp.
Scaliger. Neither ought in the 5th Place the Opinion of Mr. William Lange L.
2. de Enn. Christ.
to be passed by in Silence; who says thus; The Creation of the World was in
the Spring, on the first Day of the first Week of the first Month of the first
Year. To extricate our selves in some measure out of these Difficulties, I see
no better Remedy than to have Recourse to the most exact Account that can be
made, according to the Lunae-Solar Tables, with this Caution, not to insist so
much upon these fictitious Motions, which, as Hainlinus well observed, are only
invented by the Astronomers for better Method's sake, than upon the true and
real ones. Accordingly we have, pursuant to the Hypotheses of the Danish
Astronomy (which are the Basis of our Mathematical Tables) investigated the
Lunae-Solar Motions to begin with Sunset according to the Custom of the Jews
in Palestine.

From whence it appears, that on the same day of October in the year 764, of
the Julian Period, on which Isag. in Call. Cap. 7.
Scaliger, not without Reason, believes the World to have been created, the
Autumnal Aequinox and N. Moon did not happen together; notwithstanding this has
been contradicted by many, who have been deceived by these Astronomical Tables,
that were not exactly congruous to the true Motions of these Luminaries.
Neither am I the only Person who has observed this Discrepancy betwixt the
Equinoxes, and the time of the N. Moon. Nicolaus Mullerus has likewise
acknowledged a Difference betwixt them, of 15 Days: Wherefore out of these
several alleged Opinions and Calculations of the Astronomers, it is manifest
that we ought not to insist too rigorously upon the Characters of the Aequinox
and N. Moon, but that it is sufficient to know that the Creation of the World
happened about the time of the Aequinox and N. Moon.

. 10. Lib. 1. Theor. c. 2.
Christianus Longomontanus, who has Of the Opinion of Longomontanus.
published the Danish Astronomy, has likewise pretended to a new Character,
founded upon the Motion of the Apogaeum of the Sun; but besides that, the Point
of the Apogaeum is a mere Astronomical Fiction, invented for the better
explaining of the several Celestial Motions: It is confessed by the Consent of
the best Astronomers, that the Motions depending on it are not sufficiently
known to make them a Foundation of any solid Opinion. Lib. ^. de Sole, c. 25.
John Baptist Ricciolus has exhibited us a Catalogue of 17 of the ablest
Astronomers who affirm this for an undeniable Truth.

. 11. There is a great Discrepancy betwixt Concerning the various Opinions
about the Computation of this Epoch.
the Greeks, Hebrews, and modern Latin Authors about the true Computation of
the Years of the World. St. Ad Tit. Cap. 3.
Hierom did in his days already complain that even among those that had founded
their Calculations from the Hebrew Text, there were very few who did agree
entirely in their Opinions. This Variety of Sentiments has increased since to
that degree, that to pretend to examine and correct the almost innumerable
Differences of all these Authors, would be to undertake an endless piece of
Work. Joannes Wolfius, Sixtus Sinensis, Krantzhemius, Elias Reusnerus, Leo
Allatius, Fabritius Paduanus, and many others have endeavored to make a
Collection of the several Opinions concerning the Epoch of the World; but upon
a strict Examination we have observed that these great Men, whilst they
endeavored to discover the Errors of others, are unhappily fallen under
several Mistakes themselves, by confounding the vulgar Epoch of Christ, with
those supposed as such by those Authors they intended to correct.

To give you a small Epitome of the various Opinions of the best Astronomers on
this Subject, I have inserted here about half a hundred of them, disposed in
such an Order as that in the first Column you may find the Year of the Julian
Period, which has been assigned for the Epoch of the World, according to the
Hypothesis of each Author, whose Name stands equal with the Number, though he
perhaps himself not as much as dreamt of the Julian Period. The second Column
shows the Interval betwixt the beginning of the World and the vulgar Epoch of
Christ, according to the Opinion of each Author, whose Name is mentioned in the
same Line with the Number. Betwixt both the Columns we thought fit to insert
the Number of the Cycle of the Sun that we might not be censured of pretending
to give you Instructions without a right Character; and that we might present
the Reader with a Key to as many Chronological Treatises as there are Authors

CHAP. II. Of the Epoch of the Jews.
1. This Epoch has the same beginning with the Creation of the World. 2. It
begins in Autumn in the Month Tisri. 3. The years of this Epoch are
Lunae-Solar years, containing sometimes twelve, sometimes thirteen Months. 4.
May consequently be compared to the Julian years. 5. The first year of this
Epoch was likewise the first in the Sabbatic Cycle. 6. From the Beginning of
this Epoch to the vulgar Dionysian Era, are 3760 Years, and about four
Months. 7. The beginning of this Epoch falls out in the year of the Julian
Period 953, in the first Month of Autumn, in the first Cycle of the Sun, and
the third of the Moon, according to the Latin Calculation. 8. Wherefore if you
add to the Jewish Epoch 952 To find the Year since the beginning of this
Epoch.
Years and 8 Months, the Sum will be equivalent to the Year of the Julian
Period; and if you subtract the said 952 Years and 8 Months from the Year and
Month of the Julian Period; the Residue shows the Year of the Jewish Epoch.
. 1. THIS Epoch is called the Jewish Epoch, The Origin of this Epoch.
because the Jews commonly make use of it in their Records and Writings;
sometimes expressing the whole Number of Years; sometimes by leaving out the
Thousands; of which more hereafter.

. 2. The Jews do as little agree in this Epoch, Different Opinions among the
Jews concerning this Epoch.
as the Christians in theirs, concerning the Creation of the World, as is
manifestly apparent out of their Chronologies. But as we Christians make use of
our vulgar Era of Christ, notwithstanding the same is looked upon as erroneous
by the Learned, so the Jews use this Epoch of the Beginning of the World in
all their Records.

. 3. The Jews express this Epoch sometimes How the Jews write the years of
this Epoch.
by Letters, sometimes by Numbers, and very frequently abbreviated, by leaving
out the millennary Number. As for Instance: The Learned Jew, Menasseh Ben
Israel, when he published the Hebrew Bible in our time at Amsterdam, affixed to
it, the Year 395. Whereas, if he had expressed the whole Number of Years, he
must have writ, in the year 5395.

. 4. Both the Time and Author of this Epoch Of the Author of this Epoch.
is unknown as well among the Jews as Christians. Scaliger refers the Origin of
this Epoch to the time of the Seleucides. Christomannus is of Opinion that the
Jews did not introduce this Epoch till after their Babylonian Thalmud. There
are also others who believe this Epoch to have been received among them in
latter Ages; as may be seen in Eclog. l. 1. c. 1.
Samuel Petit, and de Doct. Temp. l. 7. c. 17.
Petavius. It is our Opinion that the Jews cannot show any sufficient Authority
for the Antiquity of this Epoch.

. 5. We told in the preceding Chapter that the Concerning the difference
betwixt the Christians and Jews in this Epoch,
World was created in the year 764 of the Julian Period. And whereas the Jews,
according to their Hypothesis, refer it to the year 953 of the Julian Period,
it is manifest that betwixt the true Epoch of Scaliger and the Jewish there is
a difference of 189 years. Josephus Scaliger, Henricus Wolffius, Robertus
Pontanus, and several others, are of Opinion that this was only an artificial
Epoch among the Jews, not intended to determine the true time of the Creation
of the World. But I cannot find any Reason sufficient to induce me to agree
with them; because it has always been entitled as such; and the Jews were so
careful in maintaining, or at least palliating this Computation of their Epoch
of the World, that they have industriously contracted several Intervals into a
less Number of Years, especially in what relates to the second Monarchy and the
Interval betwixt the Destruction of the first, and the rebuilding of the last
Temple, contrary to the ancient and undoubted Monuments of both the Sacred and
Profane History; as is most evident out of the lesser Chronicle of the Jews in
the Intervals set down from the Creation of the World to the Destruction of the
second Temple.

Years. From Adam to the Deluge, 1656 From the Deluge till the Division of
Tongues, 340 From thence till the Nativity of Isaac, 52 From thence to the time
of their going out of Egypt, 400 From thence till their Arrival in the Land of
Canaan, 40 From thence to the Babylonian Captivity, 850 From thence to the
rebuilding of the Temple, 70 From thence to the Destruction of the second
Temple, 420 The total Sum from the Creation till the Destruction of the 2d
Temple being 3828

From whence it is apparent, that they would not have their Epoch pass for an
Invention; but the true Era of the Creation of the World. But there are not a
few, among whom is Chron p. 237.
Isaacus Vossius, who imputes to the Jews that they did thus mutilate their
Computations not till after the Destruction of Jerusalem, out of a Hatred to
the Christian Name; when besides many other lesser Intervals, they cut off
1440 years from the true Computation extant in their most ancient Manuscr^p^s,
that thus by introducing a Defect of two thousand Years, they might render the
Coming of Christ dubious to Posterity.

. 6. And the Jews did not settle their Annual Of the Jewish Years.
Computations upon imaginary or fictitious Notions; but for many Ages past were
guided by the Motions of the great Luminaries. Thus Maimonides says, the Months
of the Year are the Months of the Moon. Our Years are computed by the Years of
the Sun.

. 7. Yet Scaliger has been very anxious in finding According to which
Hypothesis the Jews regulated their Years.
out which of the Astronomical Hypotheses the Jews have followed in their
Lunae-Solar Year: But in my Opinion he might have saved himself much Labor and
Time, if he would but have considered that the Jews had followed the Footsteps
of Ptolemy, as is sufficiently demonstrated by Nicholaus Mullerus in his
Preface to a Treatise concerning the Lunae-Solar Years of the Jews.

. 8. The Names Order, and Number of Days The Names and Order of the Jewish
Months.

Year begins with the Month Nisan) are expressed in the following Table.

sorts of the Jewish Years.
times an extraordinary one: From whence it comes that they divided their Years
in the common Years of 12 Months, and the Embolismaean Years. And whereas their
Months consisted by turns of 30, and again of 29 Days; the first are called the
complete, the last the defective Months: And to prevent any Confusion which
might arise from this alternative Change in the Translation of the Feria's,
they were obliged either to augment or diminish the Number of Days of certain
Months; so that the Years of the Jews were divided into six several sorts: For

The Common Year was divided into
Days. 1. The abounding Year, containing 355 2. The common Year, containing 354
3. The defective Year, containing 353

The Embolismaean Year was likewise divided into

Days. 4. The abounding Year, containing 385 5. The common Year, containing 384
6. The defective Year, containing 383

These Varieties of Years proceeding from the Interpolation of Days affected
only the three Months Adar, Marchesvan, and Casleu: For in the Embolismaean
Year there were two Months of Adar, and in the abounding Year the Month
Marchesvan was always complete, as in the defective Year the Month Casleu was
always defective: So that in the first there were always three successive
complete Months, in the last always three successively defective.

CHAP. III. Of the Epoch of the Deluge.
1. This Epoch ought in all respects to be congruous to the Hebrew Text
written by Moses. 2. According to the 5th and 7th Chapters of Genesis the
Distance betwixt this Epoch and that of the World, ought to be 1656 years. 3.
It must agree in all respects with the other Intervals of Time, till the
Beginning of the Vulgar Christian Epoch, which contains 2293 years. 4. Care is
to be taken that none of the Patriarchs be involved in the Waters of the
Deluge. 5. Thus it will fall in the Year of the Julian Period 2420, in Autumn,
in the Cycle. 12.. 7. 6. And since therefore there are 2419 years and near How
to investigate the years since the Deluge.
10 months difference betwixt the Beginning of the Julian Period and the Epoch
of the Deluge, if the said Sum be added to the Number of years since the
Deluge, the Product will be exactly correspondent to the Year of the Julian
Period. But if the above said Number of Years and Months be subtracted from the
whole Product, the Residue shows the Year and Month of the Epoch of the
Deluge.
. 1. PLiny in his Natural History, Bibl. l. 1.

Siculus, as likewise Saturn. l. 1.
Macrobius, with many others, relate that among the Egyptians their Years were
in most ancient times sometimes of one Month, sometimes of two, three or four
Months; which has perhaps moved Varro (according to L. 2. c. 13.
Lanctantius his Testimony) to interpret the Computation, of Moses not of Solar
but Lunar Years. But this may be sufficiently confuted by that Mention is made
in Genesis 8. 13.

Thara the Father of Abraham, who is said to have begot Abraham in the 70th
Year of his Age.

. 2. And as most Chronologers agree in this Point, Whether they were So^^r or
Lu^ae-Solar years.
that the Years used by the Patriarchs have not been much different from those
in the Julian Calendar; so they are divided in their Opinions whether in those
Ancient Times they made their Computations by Lunae-Solar or Solar Years. The
Jews are of Opinion that the Year of the Deluge was the same with their
ordinary Year, con^isting of 12 Months, according to the Motion of the Moon.
Some of their Rabbi's have been vain enough to pretend to persuade the World
that during the time of the Deluge, the two great Luminaries did not appear
above that Hemisphere; and that Noah did distinguish the Times of the Days,
Nights, Months and Years, partly by the Natural Instinct that was in some
Beasts within the Ark, of distinguishing the Times as in the Ass, Cock, Turkey,
etc. partly by a certain Gem of the same Nature with that by which they say,
Moses knew the exact difference of Times, when he conversed with God for 40
Days. There are not a few among the Christians, but especially Henricus
Buntingus and William Lange, who agree with the Jews in this Supposition
concerning the Lunae-Solar Years.

But Scaliger is quite of another Sentiment, being persuaded that before the
Babylonian Captivity there were not the least Footsteps of these Lunae-Solar
Years to be met with in the Holy Scripture; because it is said of David and
Solomon, That they had twelve Officers which provided Provisions for the King
and his Household; each Man made Provision for his Month in the Year: And that
therefore if the Lunae-Solar Year had been in use among the Jews of that time,
there must have been thirteen Officers by reason of the Embolismaean Year,
consisting of thirteen Lunar Months. It is for this Reason that Scaliger as
well as Johannes Behmius, Vbbo Emmius, Sethus Calvisius and others, plead for
the Solar Year at the time of the Deluge, each Month, like the Egyptians,
consisting of 30 days, with an Addition of five Days at certain Intervals. I
must confess it is of no great Consequence as to the Historical Truth, whether
we admit the Lunae-Solar or Solar Years; yet It cannot be denied but that there
are strong Probabilities to be met with in the History of the Deluge, which
appear in behalf of the Solar Years. It is said in (g) Genesis, That on the
17th day of the second Month all the Fountains of the *Cap. 7. v. 11.
Earth and the Windows of Heaven were opened; and Cap. 8. v. 3.
that the Waters began to abate after the end of an hundred and fifty Days;
Cap. ib. v. 4.
and that the Ark rested on the seventeenth Day of the seventh Month. From
whence it is evident that these could be no Lunar Months, each of which
consisting only of 29 Days and 12 Minutes, could not make up the Number of 150
Days. It is therefore most probable, that they regulated themselves at that
time according to the same Calendar, which afterward was called the Egyptian,
each Month of which contained exactly 30 Days; and at the end of every Year an
Addition was made of five Days, besides that at the end of every Age,
consisting of 120 Years, (of which also mention is made in C. 6. v. 3.
Genesis) there used to be a further Addition of fix other Days: In which point
also Lib. 9. C. 9* de Doct. temp.
Dionysius Petavius seems to agree with Scaliger, though in most other Matters
he is contradictory to his Opinion.

. 4. Both the ancient and modern Authors are Various Opinions concerning this
difference.
extremely divided in their Opinions concerning this vast Disproportion betwixt
the Hebrew and Greek Text. Lib. 19. c. 43. de Civ. Dei.
St. Austin is of opinion, that some being pre-possessed with an Opinion that
the Years of the Patriarchs were to be understood of Lunar or Monthly Years*
had inserted these Alterations in the Version of the LXX Interpreters. M^rin
with some others, on the other hand maintain that the Hebrew Text is corrupted.
But among all the modern Authors, Isaacus Vossius and Bryon Walton plead
strongly for the Authority of the Greek Version; and accuse all the
Chronologers of a most manifest Error for having left out above fifteen Ages in
their Computation of the Age of the World. If Moses should rise again, (says P.
248.
Vossius) in our Days he would not be able to understand one Word of the Jewish
Books, they having got their Letters from the Chaldaeans, their Points and
Accents from the Massoreths. Vossius goes yet further, alleging that not only
the Letters but the Sense it self is corrupted, not only by the Carelessness of
the Transcribers, but especially by the inveterate Malice of the Jews. His
Words containing the whole Substance of his New Hypothesis are these: He, says
he, that has a desire to attain to the Understanding of the true sense of the
Holy Writ, ought not to make the least Reflection upon the Vowels which are
inserted by the Massoreths: But if any use is to be made of them et all, it
must be done by correcting them according to the Translation of the LXX
Interpreters. Th^^ is the true Text, whose Authority is founded upon the
Approhation of the most ancient Jews, the Evangelists, the Apostles, and the
whole Primitive Church. To give my real Sentiment in this weighty Affair,
considering the great Reputation established by the Approbation of Antiquity,
of the undoubted Skill of the LXX Interpreters in the Hebrew and Greek
Languages, and their unquestionable Fidelity and Sincerity, they ought not to
be bereaved of their due Praise, if we were well assured that this Version was
transmitted to Posterity without any Alteration. But those, who accuse the
Chronologers with so much Boldness would have done well to have been fully
satisfied first whether the Hebrew Text or the Greek Version was adulterated,
especially since the last is called by many in Question, nay even looked upon
as supposititious. Of which Opinion is the Learned Bp of Armagh, who in a
particular Treatise pretends to demonstrate, that the true Version of the LXX
Interpreters was always kept close in the Alexandrian Library, no body being
permitted to read, much less to transcribe it. That after the Burning of the
said Library another had been compiled, and substituted in the room of that of
the LXX Interpreters about the time of Ptolemaeus Philadelphus, which being
approved of as genuine by some, was received by the Apostles and their
Disciples in the Church. It Is true, Arm^chanus has not many Followers in this
Opinion; but there are not wanting such as believe that we have only Fragments
of the true Version of the LXX Interpreters left now adays, the rest being
only Additions which are put upon the World under the same Name. It appears to
me, says Lib. 2. c. 6. de V. D.
Bellarmine, probable that the Version of the LXX Interpreters is as yet
extant, but so much vitiated and corrupted that it is scarce to be known. And
which way are we assured that the said Translation was made from the Hebrew?
For if it was done from the Samaritan only, it carries not the same Weight with
it as if it had been taken from the Original.

. 5. The Arguments which Vossius alleges in The Arguments of Vossius for his
Hypothesis.
behalf of the Translation of the LXX Interpreterpreters, and its Preference
before the Hebrew Text, may be comprehended under three several Heads: the
first is the Authority and Consent of most Nations, as the Egyptians, Chinese
and others: The second is the Authority of all the Fathers of the Primitive
Church. Those who follow the common Compution Dissert. de aetat. mundi, p. 257.
(says he) rely barely upon the Authority of the Rabbis, but we upon the the
true sense of the Hebrew Text before it was adulterated by the Jews. We rely, I
say, upon the Authority of the LXX Interpreters, of all the Fathers and the
whole primitive Church, together with the Consent of all the most ancient
Nations. The third Objection is, that the Intervals related in the Genealogies
of so numerous an Offspring are in no wise proportionable to their vast Number.
The first Objection has been already answered by us in the first Chapter. The
second is resolved by De Not. Christi, p. 250.
Gerard John Vossius the Father of Isaacus Vossius, who says that the Intention
of the Primitive Fathers and Councils being merely to promote those things
which properly belong to the advancing of the true Christian Faith, were not
willing to enter into Disputes about these indifferent Matters, but retained
the Translation of the LXX Interpreters, for the better Convenience of such as
were not versed in the Hebrew Tongue. In the third he relies upon a false
Supposition, as if the ancient Fathers had not had a more numerous Offspring
than what is expressly set down in the Books of Moses, whereas the Scripture
only gives us some of their Genealogies, not an entire Catalogue of their
Posterity, as has been well observed by De Civ. Dei, l. 15. c. 15.
St. Austin.

. 6. Petavius, with some of his Adherents, Whether the 1656 Years till the
Deluge were complete Years.
call in question whether the 1656 Years mentioned by Moses to have been
betwixt the Creation of the World and the Deluge were complete Years: But
Scaliger, Henr. Buntingus, Sethus Cal^i^^s, Behmius, Frankenbergius and William
Lange positively affirm it. First because of the Age of Methusalem it being
said Genesis ^. v. 26.
that Methusalem after he begot Lamech, lived 782 Years. But if the Deluge
began in the six hundredth Year of N^^^'s Age, Methusalem could not have lived
above 781 years: for Lamech lived 182 Years when he begat Genesis 5. v. 28.
Noah: If to these be added 599 Years, which our Adversaries pretend to have
been the Age of Noah at the time of the Deluge, the whole Product will amount
to 781 Years, which is contrary to the express Words of Moses. Secondly,
because Moses makes use of a Phrase in this Place, which always comprehends the
Number of complete Years. Thirdly, because the subsequent Intervals confirm it.

. 7. Henricus Buntingus, and Jacobus Hainlinus; Whether the Deluge began in the
Spring.
but above all others, Gerhardus Joannes Vossius, are fully of Opinion that the
Deluge began in the Spring, looking upon this Season as the most proper for the
Propagation of those Creatures (u) Isag. Chron. c. 5.
that went forth out of the Ark: And, that if it had happened in Autumn they
would have been in danger of perishing by Famine by reason of the approaching
Winter: Whereas the Spring Season might furnish them with sufficient Alimony in
a short time. But it seems more probable to me, that the Deluge began in
Autumn; because the Ancients began their Year in Autumn, without question in
respect to the Epoch of the World, of which we have spoke in the first
Chapter. And the sacred History tells us expressly that the Deluge began in the
second Month. This General Destruction (says L. 1. c. ^. Ant.
Josephus) happened in the six hundredth Year of Noah, in the second Month, which
is called among the Macedonians Di^^, among the Jews Marshu, (and commonly
Marchesvan) according to the monthly Account of the Egyptians. In answer to
the Objections made by our Adversaries against the Autumnal Season, we allege
the Words of the Learned Behrnius Man. Chron. p. 10.
: Did Noah give these Gentlemen any Account of what stones of Provisions there
was left when he went forth out of the Ark? Did not the whole Surface of the
Earth furnish a sufficient Quantity of Dead Carcasses for the Voracious wild
Beasts to feed upon? Besides what the Tops of the Mountains dunged with the
slimy Relicts of the Waters, Genesis 8. 5.
and nourished for five months, before by the Rays of the Sun might afford for
their Sustenance? And supposing some Animals did not procreate immediately
after the Deluge; this could not create a Famine in Noah 's Family.

. 8. There is a great Dispute among the Of the ^0 Days Rain and 150 Days of the
Increase of the
Chronologers concerning the forty Days Rain, and the Increase of the Waters
for 150 Days, mentioned in the Relation of the Deluge. To enucleate which, we
must look upon the Words of the Text in C. 7. v. 11. 17. 24.
Genesis: In the six hundredth year of Noah 's Life in the 2 d Month, the 7th
day of the month, the same day were all the Fountains of the great deep broken
up, and the Windows of Heaven were opened, and the Rain was upon the Earth 40
Days and 40 Nights; and the Flood was 40 Days upon the Earth, and the Waters
increased, and bare up the Ark, and it was lift up above the Earth; and the
Waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the Earth, and the Ark went
upon the face of the Waters; and the Waters prevailed exceedingly upon the
Earth, and all the high Hills that were under the Heaven were covered; and the
Waters prevailed Cap. 8. v. 3. 4.
upon the Earth an hundred and fifty days; and the Waters returned from off the
Earth continually; and after 150 days, the Waters were abated; and the Ark
rested in the 7th Month, on the 17th day of the Month upon the Mountains of
Ararat. From these Words the Jewish Chronologers pretend to prove that the 40
Days ought not to be included in the 150; and that therefore the total Increase
of the Waters of the Deluge lasted 190 Days; whereas on the other hand Scaliger
is of opinion that the 40 Days are included in the 150. Joannes Waltherus looks
upon this Question to be involved in such Difficulties as not to be easily
resolved. But upon strict Examination of the whole History of the Deluge, it is
no difficult Task to judge that Scaliger's Opinion is to be preferred before
the other; it being said expressly that there were five Months passed from the
beginning of the Deluge, when the Ark rested upon the Mountains of Aratat. Now
if the 40 Days were not to be included in the 150 Days, it must of necessity
follow, that each of these Months had contained 38 Days.

. 9. There being so many various Opinions Various Opinions concerning the
Universality of the Deluge.
concerning the Universality of the Deluge, as well in respect of the
Terrestrial Globe as the total Destruction of all its Inhabitants, we will give
you a Scheme of the chiefest among them. The first are the Jews, who extend
this Universality of the Deluge, not only to all the Terrestrial Creatures, but
the Fish which, they say were suffocated by the Heat of the Rains and Waters
which broke out of the deep Fountains of the Earth. There are secondly, also
some among the Jews who deny this Universality of the Deluge, and pretend, that
besides the eight Persons included in the Ark, Ogg the King of Basan was
preserved. To the third Class belong the Scholasticks, who are of opinion that
Enoch, who at that time dwelled in the Paradise, was not involved in the
Deluge. To the fourth Class belong those who maintain, that not only a few
Persons, but whole Nations never felt the Effects of this great Inundation, but
that the Jews only, and the other Inhabitants of Palestina perished in it. The
fifth in order don't deny but that a total Destruction of the whole Humane Race
was caused by the Deluge; yet so as that the whole Terrestrial Globe was not
overwhelmed by the Waters: which Opinion is founded upon two other Hypotheses;
to wit, That at the time of the Deluge the Earth remained as yet for the
greatest part desolate without any Inhabitants; and that all the Waters of the
Universe could not have been sufficient to cause an universal Deluge. This
Abraham Mylius pretends to demonstrate, that if all the Waters of the Universe
had been sent down upon Earth, they could not have covered the Tops of the
highest Mountains. (c) Isaacus Vossius approves of both these Hypotheses. The
sixth and last are those who have chosen the truest (b) Diss. de Aetat mundi,
p. 284.
Opinion, and maintain that the Deluge was Universal, both in respect of the
Terrestrial Globe and its Inhabitants; because the Motive which induced God
thus to punish the whole Earth was universal, God complains that every
Imagination of the Thoughts of Man's Heart was only evil continually. (2.)
God's Threats were universal without Exception: I will destroy Man whom I have
created, from the Face of the Earth, both Man and Beast, and the creeping
thing, and the Fowls of the Air; for it repented me that I have made them. (3.)
The Execution was universal: Genesis 7. v. 21.
All Flesh died that moved upon the Earth, both of Fowl and of Cattle, and of
Beast, and of every creeping thing that creeps upon the Earth; and every Man.
(4*) The building of the Ark it self was a convincing Argument for the
Universality of the Deluge: For what else could have moved Noah to build it
when he might have transferred himself with his Family to another Place: And
(5.) It would have savoured much of Folly, if Noah had taken so much pains to
gather all the Creatures in the Ark, if there had been enough left in other
Places. To all this may be added the general Consent of the Gentiles, who, though
they have mixed their Relations of the Deluge with many of their Fables and
Fictions; yet all agree in this Point, that it has been universal. It is for
this reason I cannot sufficiently admire how the Learned L. 18. c. 8. de Dei.
St. Austin could be so much overseen as to declare, that there were not the
least Footsteps of this Deluge to be met with in the Greek and Latin Authors;
the contrary of which has been sufficiently demonstrated by Lib. 1. de Relig.
Hugo Grotius. (d) Genesis 6. v. 5. 7.


CHAP. IV. Of the Chaldaean Epoch, and the Reigns of the Assyrian Monarchs.
1. The principal thing to be taken care of in this Epoch is, not to fix its
beginning beyond that of the Deluge. 2. To be very cautious in contradicting
the Authority of Cresias Cnidius, Diodorus Siculus, Aemilius Sura, Castor,
Eusebius, and some other Ancient Historians. 3. Care ought also to be taken,
that the time of this Epoch be not contracted into too narrow a Compass, it
being evident out of the Holy Scripture, that the Chaldaean and Assyrian
Monarchy is very ancient. 4. The beginning of the Chaldaean or Babylonian Era
ought to be fixed at same remarkable time or other mentioned in their History,
either from the first Foundation of their Capital City, or the Original of that
Monarchy. 5. From the Beginning and first Institution of the Chaldaean Era,
till the time of Alexander the Great, are computed 1903 Years, according to
Callisthenes; Because, says Aristoc. de Coel. Libr.
Simplicius, these Astronomical Observations which Callisthenes, (pursuant to
the Instructions received from Aristotle) had sent to Babylon, were not then to
be met with in Graecia; which, as Porphyrius affirms, were preserved 1903
Years; to wit, till the Times of Alexander the Great. 6. The Assyrian Monarchy
has lasted near 1300 years, according to Cresias Cnidius and Lib. 2. Bibl.
Diodorus Siculus, Aemilius Sura, in Velleius Paterculus, Trogus in Justin, In
Chron.
Eusebius, C. 17. c. 21. de civ. Dei.
St. Austin. 7. The Assyrian Monarchy did already flourish at the time of
Abraham, according to the Testimony of L. 11. Ant. c. 10.
Josephus, who speaking about the Expedition of Abraham, undertook against the
four Kings, says, that it happened at the time when the Assyrians were Masters of
Asia. 8. It seems very probable that the Assyrian Monarchy began in the times
of Phaleg, about which time also happened the Confusion of Tongues Genesis c. 11. v.
9.
. 9. All the ancient Histories both of the Greeks and Barbarians agree in this
point, that the first Monarch of all Asia was Ninus the Son of Belus, the
Founder of the Capital City of the Assyrians of the same Name. 10. Ninus was
not absolutely the first King over the Chaldaeans and Assyrians, but Belus
reigned before him, according to Castor in Eusebius. We have only mentioned
Belus, but have begun our History with the Reign of Ninus. 11. The Assyrian
Monarchy began to flourish about the same time when Babylon was either built or
enlarged, and made the Royal Seat of that Empire, where Nimrod kept his
Residence, as is manifest out of C. 10. v. 10.
Genesis and L. 1. Ant. c. 5.
Josephus. All the profane Historians seem to agree in this, that Babylon was
built by Belus; concerning which Abydenus with Eusebius says, Belus built the
Walls of Babylon. And Dorotheus Sidonius in Julius Firmicus. (...). The ancient
City of Babylon, the Work of Belus the Tyrian. (q) Scr. Evang. L. 9. c. 4.

Curtius makes mention of the Royal Residence of Belus. L. 23. c. 20.
Ammianus Marcellinus of the Temple of Belus. L. 1 ^. ^6.
Pliny of the Sepulch. of Belus. 12. The Observations therefore mentioned by
Porphyrius, to have been made at Babylon, were begun in the Year of the Julian
Period 2481, and the Assyrian Monarchy was founded by Nimrod or Belus in the
Year of the Julian Period 2538. Any Year of the Julian Period given to find the
Year sinc^ the Beginning of this Epoch.
13. If therefore you subtract 2480 Years from any Year of the Julian Period,
the Remainder will be the Year of the Chaldaean Epoch; and if in like manner
you subtract 2537 Years from the same Year of the Julian Period, the Superplus
will show the Year since the Beginning of the Assyrian Monarchy.
. 1. THere are not a few who call in question Concerning the Authority of
Ctesias Cnidius.
the Authority of Ctesias Cnidius concerning the Chronology of the first
Monarchy. I am not, (says In Bibl. de Sec. mund aet. p. 12^.
Christianus Schotanus) of the same Opinion with Ctesias, though I am not
ignorant that most Historians have declared for him Two Objections are made
against his Authority; First because Plutarch did in his time accuse him of
Falsehood in his Writings; and C^d. 72.
Photius says, that his Books are filled up with Fables. Secondly, Because
Herodotus has lived a considerable time before Ctesias, and consequently has a
Prerogative before him. But neither of these two are sufficient to destroy the
Authority of Ctesias: For as to the first, Plutarch and some others of the
ancient Historians have objected as many Errors to Herodotus as Ctesias:
Neither see I any Reason why a whole History should be rejected by reason of
some few Errors, especially when we are destitute of others, from whence we
might receive better Instructions; and that Plutarch did not call in question
his whole History, but only some particular Passages. As to the second, it is
observed that Ctesias though he lived after Herodotus; yet being conversant in
Persia and Assyria, and having the Opportunity of inspecting their Records and
Annals, ought to be preserred before him. There being besides this but forty
Years difference betwixt the Computation made by Herodotus and that of Ctesias,
it is much more safe to follow the latter, till Herodotus's Followers can show
us more Authentic Monuments of Antiquity, which I much question, How to
reconcile two several Possages of Ctesias.
whether they will ever be able to effect.

. 2. Diodorus Siculus out of Ctesias gives us two different Computations
concerning the time of the Assyrian Monarchy. Of the first he says thus: Lib.
2. Bibl. p. 7^. ^dit. Rhodomic.
Under the Reign of Sardanapalus, the Assyrian Monarchy, after it had
flourished 1360 Years (according to Ctesias Cnidius, Lib. 2.) was devolved to
the Medians. Of the second he has these Words: Codem^n. Lib. p ^^.
Thus the Assyrian Empire, which from the time of Ninus had lasted 1400 Years,
was destroyed by the Medians. To resolve this Difficulty, it seems that the
last Passage of Dicdorus Siculus, as well as several others of this Author has
been adulterated, it being manifest that according to Ctesias, the Assyrian
Monarchy did not flourish much above 1300 Years. Thus much is certain, that
Clemens Alexandrinus, does not attribute more than 1300 Years to the Assyrian
Monarchy out of Diodorus and Ctesias, which agrees exactly with the time
mentioned in the Eusebian Fragments, collected by Scaliger.

. 3. The following Table represents a The Names and Order of the Assyrian
Monarchs.
Catalogue of the Assyrian Monarchs, according to Eusebius and Africanus, till
the time of Sardanapalus. We have added to the Computation of Eusebius, the
Year of the Julian Period, in which, according to this Hypothesis, each of
these Kings began his Reign: And to the Computation of Africanus likewise the
Year of the Julian Period pursuant to the Opinion of Scaliger and William
Lange, out of which every one may choose such as he finds most suitable to his
own Judgment.

Catalogue of Africanus, Concerning the difference betwixt Eusebius and

and consequently his Computation falls 162 Years short of the other; he has
not escaped the Censures of the Chronologers. In ^^imadr. ad Eusebius.
Josephus Sealiger says that Eusebius did this for no other Reason, but to make
the Reign of Teutamus coincident with the Trojan War. On the other hand ^. 9 c.
12. de doct. temp.
Petavius speaks much in the Commendation of Eusebius, because he would not
follow his Footsteps when he found them to be erroneous. What should move (says
he) Eusebius, rather to follow Africanus than Diodorus, Cresias, and several
other Historians, who attribute no more than 1300 Years to the Assyrian
Monarchy? I agree thus far with Petavius, as the Eusebian Catalogue is
consonant to the Computation of the Holy Scriptures; whereas that of Africanus
relies barely upon the Computation of the Septuagint: Neither ought it to be
passed by in Silence here, that the Hypothesis of Eusebius is confirmed by the
Authority of Lib. 2. Bi^lioth.
Diodorus Siculus. These are his Words: The Supplies of Men sent by the
Assyrians, under the Command of Memnon the Son of Tithon, to the Trojans,
deserve also to be remembered here: For under the Reign of Teutamus, the
twentieth King after Ninyas the Son of Semiramis, that ruled over all Asia, the
Greeks engaged in a War against the Trojans under their General Agamemnon above
a thousand Years after the Assyrians had been Masters of Asia. Out of these
Words of Diodorus it is apparent that Eusebius was not the only Person who had
made the Reign of Teutamus coincident with the time of the Trojan War, though
at the same time it is evident by our Hypothesis that all the ancient
Historians who are of the same Opinion, are in a gross Error for having
mistaken Teutamus for Thinaeus.

. 5. It has been showed before how Africanus Concerning the Opinion of
Africanus.
made his Computation according to the Number of Years attributed to the Reign
of each of the Assyrian Monarchs, in which he has been egregiously mistaken:
For if 1484 Years be subtracted from the 3838 Years of the Julian Period (which
proved fatal to Sardanapalus) the beginning of the Assyrian Monarchy will thus
fall in the Year 2354 of the Julian Period a considerable time before the
Deluge, which did not happen till in the Year 2420 of the Julian Period. But
Africanus being misled into this Error by the Computation of the Greeks or the
LXX Interpreters, had consequently no Opportunity of making Reflection upon the
Absurdity that must needs ensue of the Assyrian Kings Reigns at the time of the
Deluge. It is much more to be admired how Can. Isag. p. 1^1.
Josephus Scaliger, who in all other Matters constantly adheres to the Hebrew
Computation, should in this Point be so much taken with the Hypothesis of
Africanus; especially since (according to his own Supposition) the Deluge began
in the Year 2420 of the Julian Period.

. 6. Herodotus speaks thus concerning the Assyrian Concerning the Opinion
Herodorus of the Assyr^an Monarchy.
Empire: After the Assyrians had ruled in Asia about 520 Years, the Medians
were the first who bravely asserted their Liberty after they had shaken off the
Assyrian Yoke, other Nations followed their Example. Besides several others*
Jacobus Vsserius, and Christianus Schotanus consent with Herodotus in this
Point. But Herodotus's Authority alone could never be prevailing enough with me
to detract so much from all the other most ancient Historians Reputation, as to
look upon their Relations as so many Fables or Fictions. For first, according
to Plutarch himself, nothing is more common than for Herodotus to be in a
Mistake in the Relations of these things which were transacted before his time.
Secondly, it is worth Observation, that Herodotus only made mention of the
Assyrian Empire, as it was, by the bye; so that his Words cannot be supposed to
come in Competition with the Histories of these Authors, who having had the
Opportunity of searching narrowly into the Transactions of the Assyrians, have
transmitted their Monuments to Posterity. Thirdly, the Words of Herodotus which
follow immediately after the abovementioned Passage, in which he pretends to
impose upon the World (as shall be demonstrated hereafter) that the Medians
lived without Kings till the time of Dejoces, render his Assertion concerning
the Assyrian Empire very suspicious. Fourthly, as the Ancient City of Nineve is
an unquestionable Argument for the Antiquity of its Founder Ninus; so it
plainly demonstrates the Ignorance of Herodotus. Fifthly, the Words in the
abovementioned Passage are so dubious and obscure that it is impossible for
any body as much as to guess from thence at the beginning or end of the
Assyrian Monarchy; there being not the least mention made from who is Kings
Reign it was, that Herodotus intended to begin his Computation; nor by what
fatal Accident and under what King a Period was put to this Monarchy: Not to
mention here that some are of Opinion that this Passage in Herodotus is
supposititious.

. 7. The main Objection made against that Interval which we have set betwixt
the Deluge Ob^ection against the Intervals betwixt the Deluge and Beginning of
the Assyrian Monarchy.
and the Epoch of the Assyrian Monarchy is, how eight People that went forth
out of the Ark of Noah could be sufficient to produce in so little a time so
numerous a Stock as to suffice for the erecting so potent an Empire, which is
the reason that St. L. 8. c. 22. de Civ. Dei.
Austin has extended this Interval to a thousand Years. Of the same Opinion is
also Diss. de (...). mund. p. 257.
Isaacus Vossius, who ridicules those that pretend to answer this Objection, by
a Supposition that the Patriarchs began to procreate Children under the Age of
twelve. But Lib. 9. c. 14. de doctr. temp.
Dionysius Petavius has attempted another way to satisfy the World in this
Scruple, by supposing only (which will be granted without Reluctance by every
body) that they began to procreate at 17 years of Age; from whence, by
multiplying the Number of 8, and its Product with 8, he demonstrates that a
vast Number of People must needs have been procreated in two hundred sixty and
one years time by so long-lived a Generation as was the first Posterity of
Noah, as may be seen out of the following Computation.

. 8. There is also no small Contest among the Historians concerning the first
Monarch or Who was the first Assyrian Monarch.
King of the Assyrians; Some following the Footsteps of the Pseudo Berosus
mention, one Saturn, who; they say, reigned 56 Years. Others maintain that the
Babylonian Empire was divided into three Principalities, the first of which was
that of the Chaldaeans, whose first King was ^vechoos (whom some will have to
have been the same with Ninus:) The second of the Arabians, whose first King
was one Mard^centes: The third, of the Assyrians, whose first King was Belus:
Of which you may consult Lib 2 p. 131.
Scaliger, Christianus Schotanus, and Isaacus Vossius in his Treatise of the
second Age of the World. But it appears most probable to me, that the
Babylonian Empire was always under the Jurisdiction of one single Monarch, till
the time of Sardanapalus; and that Nimrod, of whom mention is made in C. 10. v.
9. 10.
Genesis, was the same Belus whose Name is so famous in profane History. It Is
true that Lib. 1. Chron.
Eusebius mentions also one Saturn, but he adds expressly that he believes him
to have been the same with Belus. What concerns the two Principalities, which
Scaliger and Schotanus (according to Africanus) pretend to have been before the
time of Belus, they are to be looked upon as mere Fictions; as being
contradictory to the Sacred Writ, and the true Epoch of the Deluge it self, or
at least to its Universality.

. 9. 3 Can. Isag.
Scaliger has made a very useful Observation The Observation ^f Scaliger
concerning the Assytian Monarchy.
concerning the Assyrian Empire, that it has been more famous for its Antiquity
than its Greatness: For though its Power and Extent was very vast in the
Beginning, yet the Assyrian Monarchs giving themselves over afterward to all
manner of Voluptuousness and becoming careless of the Public Welfare, many of
the Conquered Nations shock off the Assyrian Yoke, What is mentioned in the
Books of the Judges and of the Kings in the Sacred Writ concerning the King of
Babylon, the Syrians and some other Nations bordering upon Palaestina, not
acknowledging the Jurisdiction of the Assyrian King, seems to be understood,
not of the most ancient Assyr. Monarchy when in its flourishing State, under
the Reigns of Nimrod and Ninus, but of its later times, when this Monarchy
already began to be in a declining Condition. Of which see Dionysius
Halicarnass^us Lib. 1. Antiq. Romans

. 10. The Observations made concerning the Political Observations co^c^rning
this Monar^^y.
Policy of the ancient Assyrian Monarchy by Rob. Bailius, ought not to be
passed by in Silence; For after Ninus and Semiramis with their vast Armies had
overpowered far distant Nations, their Successors chief Maxims of State tended
only to this, How to keep what they had got, not to extend their Conquests: For
which Reason they built the most magnificent Palace of Ninive, where they
always kept themselves very close, being very seldom to be seen by any body but
their nearest Servants, whereby they imprinted into the Minds of the People an
extraordinary Character of their Majesty, as having something much above the
common Rank of Mankind, whilst they themselves devoted themselves wholly to all
manner of Voluptuousness. Besides this, they drew every Year a vast Number of
Soldiers out of the Provinces under their Jurisdiction, who being quartered in
and about the City of Ninive, and commanded by such a one as was thought most
faithful: These Forces struck Terror both in the Subjects living in the Center
of the Empire, and the other Nations under their Jurisdiction. This Army was
also disbanded, and the General as well as the Governors of the Provinces
changed every Year, whereby they took away all Opportunity of putting them in a
Condition to invade the Empire. Thus the Assyrian Empire continued for 1300
Years, till the time of Sardanapalus, when the Medians put an End to this
Monarchy.

CHAP. V. Of the Epocha's of the Years of Abraham.
1. The time of the Birth of Abraham must be looked for in the 11th Chapter of
Genesis, which contains an exact Account of the Ages of the Patriarchs after
the Deluge. 2. The Year of the Birth of Abraham ought to be coincident with the
seventieth Year of Thara Genesis 11. v. 26.
. 3. According to the Mosaic Computation, the Interval betwixt the Deluge and
Abraham is of 292 Years. 4. Abraham was born when the Assyrian Monarchy
flourished in Asia, according to St. Austin L. 16. c. 17. de Civ. Dei.
. 5. The Vocation of Abraham was in the 75th year of his Age Genesis 12. v. 4.
. 6. From the 75th year of his Age, (being that of his Vocation) begins the
Epoch of the time of the Children of Israel 's abiding in Egypt, being 430
years, till the time of their going out of Egypt; from whence to reckon
backwards to the Nativity of Abraham, are 505 years Gal. 3. v. 17. Jos. L. 2.
c. 6. Antiq.
. 7. Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 years old Genesis ^^. v. 1. 5.
. 8. Abraham died when he was 175 years old Genesis 25. v. 7.
. 9. According to this Computation Abraham was born in the year 2712 of the
Julian Period, in the 24th Cycle of the Sun, and the 16th of the Moon. The
Vocation of Abraham happened in the year 2787 of the Julian Period, the Birth of
Isaac in the year 2812 of the Julian Period, and the Death of Abraham in the
year 2887 of the same Period. 10. If therefore from any certain year of the
Julian Any year of the Julian Period given to find the Year since the beginning
of this Epoch^.
Period be subtracted 2711 years for the Nativity of Abraham, 2786 for his
Vocation, 2811 for the Birth of Isaac, and 2886 years for the Death of Abraham,
the Residue will show the desired year of the Epoch of Abraham. On the other
hand, if the abovementioned Numbers of years be added to the year of the
Epoch of Abraham, the Products will be correspondent to the years of the
Julian Period.
. 1. THE following Table represents the several Of the Computation of the
Interval betwixt the Deluge and the Birth of Abraham.
Computations of the Interval betwixt the Deluge and the Birth of Abraham.

From the Deluge, According to the He. LXX Int. Josephus. Genesis xi To
Arphaxad, 2 2 12 Verse 10 To Cainaan, 0 135 135 Salah, 35 130 130 Verse 12
Eber, 30 130 130 Verse 14 Phaleg, 34 134 134 Verse 16 Ragau, 30 130 130 Verse

Verse 24 Abraham, 70 70 130 Verse 29 The whole Sum of years from the Del. to
Abrah. 292 1072 1192

Both the Computation of the LXX Interpreters and that of Josephus is taken out
of Isaacus Dissert. de aetat. Mundi. c. 8
Vossius, who, as well as Chronol. Sacr. p. 108.
Bryon Walton, follow in the Intervals of Years, both before and after the
Deluge, the Computation of the Greeks.

. 2. Chron. Sacr. p. 107.
Isaacus Vossius follows the Footsteps Whether Arphaxad was born in the ^ d or
12th year after the Deluge.
of Josephus in the time of the Birth of Arphaxad, being of Opinion that in
Genesis 11. v. 10. where it is said Shem was an hundred years old, and begat
Arphaxad two years after the Deluge, it should be said twelve; which Error he
attributes to the Carelessness of the Amanuensis, For, says he, how else could
Arphaxad have two elder Brothers, Elam and Assure? for among the Sons of Shem,
Arphaxad is mentioned in the third place: And to suppose that these three Sons,
and perhaps as many Daughters, were all born in two years time, is ridiculous.
But the Computation of Josephus is free from all these Difficulties, especially
concerning the Age of Shem. To this it is answered by some, that the Opinion of
Vossius being contrary both to the Hebrew Text, and the Translation of the
Septuagint, it may rationally be supposed, that the two elder Brothers of
Arphaxad were either Twins born in the first year after the Deluge; or that
Shem's Wife conceived whilst she was in the Ark, and immediately after brought
forth the Eldest, and in a years time after, the Second. There are also some
who believe Arphaxad to have been the Firstborn; because it is said in Genesis
11. 2. that Shem, after he begat Arphaxad, begat Sons and Daughters, and not
before.

. 3. There is another difficulty in the Genealogy Of Cainan who is put betwixt
Arphaxad and Salah.
of the Post-Diluvian. Patriarchs concerning Cainan, who in the Translation of
the LXX Interpreters is put betwixt Arphaxad and Salah. These are their Words
in Genesis 10. v. 24. And Arphaxad begot Cainan, Cainan begot Salah. And in the
11th Chapter, v. 11. And Arphaxad lived 130 years and begot Cainan. And the
first of Chronicles, Chap. 1. v. 27. And Arphaxad begot Cainan, and Cainan
begot Salah. Cainan is also mentioned in the 3d Chapter, v. 35. of St. Luke,
which was the Son of Salah, which was the Son of Cainan, which was the Son of
Arphaxad. The Syriack, Latin, German, Low Dutch, and English Translations do
not only follow the Footsteps of the LXX Interpreters in this Point, but also
among our Modern Authors, Alphonsus Salmero, Augustus Torniellus, Jacobus
Saltanus, Isaacus Vossius, and Bryon Walton, who relying upon the Authority of
St. Luke, agrees with them in Opinion. But there are very weighty Reasons which
have moved others to contradict this Assertion. For, first, in the Hebrew Text
no mention is made of Cainan: 2. In some of the most ancient Translations of
the Bible, especially in the Samaritan, as also by Lib. 1. c. 6. ant.
Josephus, otherwise a strict Adherer to the Chronology of the Septuagint, no
mention is made of Cainan. 3. In some ancient Copies of the Gospel of St. Luke,
Cainan is likewise not mentioned; as in that of Theodorus Beza, where Arphaxad
is put immediately after Salah, which has moved Theodatus and Cartwightus, the
first to leave him out in his Italian, the last in his Latin Translation: And
Vsserius cites above twelve of the Fathers and Ecclesiastical Writers, who know
nothing of this Cainan. 4. There are also some who are of Opinion that Salah
had a double Name, his second Name being Cainan; and that there ought to have
been no distinction in St. Luke betwixt these two Names. 5. Others will have
it, that the LXX Interpreters have inserted this Cainan on purpose to make
Moses agree with the Egyptian History. But be it as it will, my Opinion is,
that the Computation of Moses cannot be erroneous, Ger. Jo. Vossius has made
this useful Observation Here Is. 55. contra M^^chis.
, that because neither Epiphanius nor St. Hierom In Trad. Ebraic.
make the least mention of Cainan, neither the said Cainan is to be found in
the best Roman Edition of the Septuagint, published by the Care of Caraffa, it
is very probable that in the original Manuscript of the LXX Interpreters no
mention was likewise made of Cainan.

. 4. The Words of Moses concerning the Whether the Birth of Abraham was
^oincident with the 70th Year of Thara.
Nativity of Abraham are as follows: Genesis 11 v. 2^.
And Thara lived 70 years and begat Abraham, Nachor and Haran. From which Words
the Chronologers conclude, that Abraham was not above 70 years younger than his
Father Thara. 1. Because Moses having been so exact in mentioning the 75th year
of the Age of Abraham, as also the 86th Genesis 16. v. 16.
, and the Genesis 12. 4. and 17. v. 24.
99th, it seems very improbable he should have neglected that of his Nativity.
2. Because in the Catalogue of the Children of Thara, he gives the Preference
to Abraham. In 1 Chronicles. 1. v. 28. Israel is put before Ismael his elder
Brother; but what wonder if he had the Preference given him before the Son of
his Father's Maid. Otherwise it is observable that the Scripture always relates
the Genealogy of those born in Wedlock in the same Order as they were born.
This is manifest in the Children of Rachel, who, though much beloved by their
Father, yet are inserted according to the time of their Nativities. And even he
who had sold the Prerogative of his Birthright, yet is mentioned as the eldest
in the Sacred History. 3. Because Abraham seemed to be startled at the Promise
made him, looking upon it as an Example without a Parallel, to be blessed with
a Son when he was 100 years old Genesis 17. v. 17.
. But it is not probable that Abraham would have considered it as a miraculous
thing, if he himself had been born (according to the Opinion of some in the
130th year of his Father Thara's Age.

. 5. And there arises another Difficulty in the Of the time of the Departure of
Abraham out of Haran.
Sacred Chronology concerning the time of the Departure of Abraham out of
Haran, it being said by Moses that Genesis 12. v. 4.
Abraham was 75 years old when he departed out of Haran; and by St. Acts 7. v.
4.
Stephen, that he removed from thence when his Father was dead: From whence it
is evident, that if 70 years of Thara, when he begat Abraham, be added to 75,
the Age of Abraham when he removed out of Haran, the Product will be 145 years;
whereas Genesis 11. v. ^2.
Moses says of Thara, that his Days were 205 years, and that he died in Haran:
Which has moved St. Hierom and Scaliger to look upon this Question as the
Gordian Knot. Others, among whom are Nicholas de Lyra, Calvinus, Cajetanus,
Martyr, Torniellus, Musculus, Beroaldus, Salianus, Pareus, Junius, Henricus
Philippi, Jacobus Capellus, Ludovicus Capellus, Temporarius, Vsserius, Isaacus
Vossius, and several more, pretend to resolve this Knotty Question, by
asserting that Abraham was begot by Thara when he was 130 years old; and that
the Words in Genesis, Thara lived 70 years and begat Abraham, Nahor and Haran,
are to be understood thus: That Thara was 70 years old when he began to beget
Children, among whom was Abraham (who had the Preference, as being the Father
of the Believers) Nahor (the Firstborn) and Haran (the Second;) but the
Dissolution of this Gordian Knot is owing to St. Austin, who is of Opinion that
Abraham did at least depart twice out of Haran, but did not fix his Habitation
in Canaan till the second time. With St. Austin agree in this Point Brentius,
Gesnerus, Pererius, Cornelius a Lapide, Alphonsus Tostatus, Lorinus, Robertus
Bailius, Dionysius Petavius, and others.

. 6. Eusebius in his Computation of the years Of the erroneous Computation of
Eusebius.
of Abraham is fallen into an Error, when he affirms the Interval of time
betwixt the beginning of the Julian Period and the Nativity of Abraham to have
been 2696 years and 9 months; whereas according to the Calculation of the
Hebrew Text, the same happened in the year 2712; which is the true Reason that
some who were not sensible of this erroneous Computation of Eusebius, have been
mis-guided in many of the following Epocha's.

. 7. There are some who are of Opinion that Abraham is mentioned in Profane
History.
not the least Footsteps of this Epoch of Abraham are to be found in profane
History: But these may be convinced of their Mistake by L 1. c. 8. Ant.
Josephus, who alleges the Words of the true and ancient (not the
supposititious) Berosus: In the tenth Generation after the Deluge there lived a
just and great Man among the Chaldaeans, who among other things, was well
versed in Astronomy. And in L. 36 c. 2.
Justin we find the Testimony of Trogus Pompeius: The Jews, says he, have their
Offspring from Damascus, a famous City of Syria: their Kings were Abraham and
Israel. See also Clemens Alexandrinus and Eusebius, L. 13. c. 12 Strom. V.
.

CHAP. VI. Of the Epoch of the CCCCXXX. Years the Jews sojourned in Egypt; of
which mention is made in Exodus 12. Verse 40.
1. The beginning of this Epoch must be congruous to the time of that solemn
Promise mentioned in C. 12. v. 3. c. 15. ad Gal. 3. v. 17.
Genesis, to have been made to Abraham. 2. Due Regard ought to be had to the
Age of the Forefathers of Moses, as described in Exodus C. 6. v. 19, 20.
. 3. The End of it must be coincident with the time of their leaving of Egypt.
4. The Number of the Generations of the Levitical Families recited in the
abovementioned Places ought also carefully to be observed. 5. The same Respect
must be had to the other Intervals. 6. Care must be taken, that not any thing
be inferred contradictory to the Testimony of Josephus in his 2 d Book of
Antiquities, Chap. 5. They left, says he, Egypt in the Month of Xanthicus, in
the 430th Year after the Coming of our Father Abraham into Canaan; and in the
215th Year after the Migration of Jacob into Egypt, Moses was then in his 30th
Year of Age, and his Brother Aaron three years elder than he. 7. Accordingly we
affirm, that the first year of this Epoch was coincident with the 76th year of
the Age of Abraham, which was the 2787th year of the Julian Period, Cycle. 15..
13. and its End in the Year 3217 of the Julian Period. 8. If therefore 2780
years be subtracted from any certain year of the Julian Period, the Residue Any
year given of the Julian Period to find the year since the beginning of this
Epoch.
will show the year of this Epoch: But if the same be added to any certain
year of this Epoch, the Product will be correspondent to the year of the
Julian Period. There is not any Certainty concerning the Months, they being not
mentioned in the Holy Scripture: for the Traditions of Rabbi Solomon, who
asserts, that God did make his Covenant with Abraham in the Month of Nisan, is
no more Authentic than the rest of the Jewish Traditions.
. 1. Exerc. Bibl.
MOrinus and Chron. sacr. c. 2. p. 3.
Isaacus Vossius are of Whether the Hebrew Text be corrupted concerning these
430 years.
Opinion that the Hebrew Text concerning the 430 years of the sojourning of the
Israelites in Egypt has been adulterated, and therefore prefer the Samaritan
and Greek Translations: In the first it is said thus; The sojourning of the
Children of Israel and their Forefathers who dwelt in the Land of Canaan and
Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years: Whereas in the Hebrew Text it is
thus expressed by Moses; The sojourning of the Children of Israel, who dwelt in
Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. But besides the Divine Testimony of
the unquestionable and most authentic Authority of the Hebrew Text, C. 5. v.

Authors.

. 2. There are not a few who pretend to begin This Epoch has not it is
beginning from the time of Jacob 's going into Egypt.
this Epoch from the time of Jacob's going into Egypt, of which we read in C.
46.
Genesis, but according to this Hypothesis, it is impossible to complete the
Number of 430 years of the Israelites sojourning in Egypt; for it being said
Genesis 46. v. 11.
that Jacob came into Egypt with Kohath the Son of Levi; if the whole Age of
Kohath be computed as well as that of his Son Amram (the first being of 133,
the last of 137 Exodus 7. v. 7.
Years) and the 80 Years of Moses when he spoke to Pharaoh, be added to them
both, the whole does not exceed 350 Years, which is 80 Years less than 430
Years; from whence it is evident that our preceding Computation is to be
preferred before this, it being especially confirmed by the Authority of the
Jewish Rabbi's and most of the Greek and Latin Authors. The Greeks, according
to the Translation of the LXX Interpreters, whose Words are these: The
sojourning of the Children of Israel and their Forefathers who dwelt in the
Land of Egypt and in the Land of Canaan, they and their Fathers, were 450
years. But the Latin Interpreters have followed in this Point the Footsteps of
the two Learned Fathers St. Jerome and St. Austin. These 430 years, says the
first, C. 3. Ep. ad Gal.
are to be computed from the time when God said unto Abraham, And in thee shall
all the Families of the Earth be blessed. There are to be computed (says St.
Austin) 430 years from the 75th year of the Age of Abraham, when the first
Promise was made unto him by God, till the time of the Children of Israel 's
going out of Egypt; with whom agrees Gregorius Syncellus, who affirms that the
4^0 years of the sojourning of the Children of Israel in the Land of Canaan and
Egypt, ought, according to the Opinion of all the Interpreters and Historians,
to be computed from the 75th year of Abraham.

. 3. The Jewish Interpreters agree in this Point The Jews agree with our
Opinion in this point.
in their Opinion with the Latins; The true Explication, says Rabbi Levi, of
these 430 years is to be sought for in these Words, and to be begun from the
time when God said unto Abraham, Thy Seed shall be a Stranger in a Land that is
not theirs. Of the same Opinion are likewise Rabbi Solomon, Seder Olam,
Michilta Rabah, El Pharao, Schemoth Rabah, and Tanchuina Schemot.

. 4. Eugubinus, Genebrardus and Gerhardus Johannes The Opinions of Eugubinus,
Genebrard. and G. J. Vos refuted.
Vossius begin this Epoch from the time of the going of Jacob into Egypt, and
the last from the time of Joseph's being sold into Egypt. 1. Because that in
Ex. 12. v. 40.
Exodus and the Acts 7. v. 6. c. 13. v. 16.
Acts, as well as in Genesis 15. v. 1^.
Gen^sis, there is only mention made of their dwelling in Egypt, not in the
Land of Canaan. 2. They look upon it as incongruous to the true Sense of the
Scripture, that their dwelling in Canaan should be accounted a Servitude or
Exile. 3. They allege in their behalf, the Passage in the History of C. 5.
Judith; where it is said, when the Earth was overwhelmed with Famine, they
went into Egypt, where in 400 years they increased into an innumerable
Multitude. To the first Argument we have already answered with the Words of St.
Austin. As to the second, they are extremely mistaken in their Explication,
when they have put the Forefathers of the Israelites in the Possession of the
Land of Canaan; whereas according to the C. 7. v. 5.
Acts, Abraham had no Inheritance in it, no not so much as to set his Foot on.
And in the Epistle to the Heb 11. v. 13.
Hebrews, they are said to have been Strangers and Pilgrims there. The third
may be refuted out of Vossius himself, who, though of a contrary Opinion, yet
is forced to confess that the Argument taken from the History of Judith is of
no great Weight, Achior being introduced by the Author there as a Foreigner,
who, perhaps might not have a full Insight into the Transactions and Chronology
of the Jews. Some deduce this Epoch from the Nativity of Isaac.


. 5. St. L. 16. c. 24. de civ. Dei.
Austin's Words sufficiently testify that some among the Ancients have been of
Opinion that this Epoch of 430 years ought to begin with the Nativity of
Isaac; and some of the Jewish Interpreters have constantly affirmed the same;
and have of late Years been followed by Sieurs de Dieu and Ludovicus Langius,
the last of whom L. ^. c. 4. de an. Christi.
says, It is very evident that Abraham was born in the 130th year of Thara, and
consequently in the 2680th year of the Julian Period; and that he begot Isaac
when he was 100 years old, which was the Seed promised to him before; from
whence, till the time of the Promulgation of the Law, are to be computed the
430 years mentioned by St. Paul Gal. 3. v. 17.
, etc. But the Hypothesis of Langius is built upon a wrong Foundation, there
being nothing mentioned concerning the Nativity of Isaac either in the Hebrew
Text or that of St. Paul: And as to what relates to the Nativity of Abraham in
the 130th year of Thara, has been refuted before.

CHAP. VII. Of the Epoch of Inachus, the Founder of the Kingdom of Argos in
Peloponnesus, and his Successors.
1. As the most Ancient Greek History owes its Foundation to the Memory of
Inachus King of Argos, so in fixing the beginning of the Epoch of this King,
the Footsteps of Castor and Tatianus ought to be followed before others,
according to the Computation mentioned by Eusebius Lib. 1. Chron.
. 2. According to the Testimony of these Authors, but especially of Castor, 372
years ought to be counted betwixt Inachus and Sthenelus the Son of Crotopus. 3.
The Kingdom of Argos fell after it had flourished 544 years, till the time of
Pelops. 4. After Acrisius, reigned Sthenelus 8 years: He was succeeded by
Euristheus, who reigned 43 years. Him succeeded Atreus and Thyestes, who
reigned 65 years; after whom reigned Agamemnon, whose Reign lasted fifteen
years; and in the last year of his Reign Troy was destroyed by the Greeks,
according to the Authority of the abovementioned Authors. 5. Upon the
Computation of these most ancient Authors, Scaliger has founded his
Calculation, who affirms that the Epoch of Inachus begins in the 2857th year
of the Julian Period, Cyc.. 1.. 7. 6. If therefore 2856 years be subtracted

2856 years, the Product must be correspondent to the year of the Julian Period.

to afford a peculiar Chapter for this Epoch, considering the Antiquity and
famous Transactions of these Kings, on whose History depends in a great measure
that of the Destruction of Troy. And though the Sicyonians were also in former
Ages in great Renown among the Greeks, yet if we rely upon the Authority of
Pausanias, the first contended for the Priority with all the rest.

Nations, Inachus their first King however has been very famous in the ancient
History, as among others may appear out of these following Lines of Lib. 2.

. 4. The Ancients are much divided in their Various Opinions concerning the
Chronology of these Kings.
Opinion concerning the Chronology of these Kings; for Pausanias, Hyginus, and
Clemens Alexandrinus disagree with Eusebius, and those other abovementioned
Authors. Pausanias mentions several Kings not named by Eusebius, and omits
others, who is followed by Hyginus (and according to the Computation of Clemens
Alexandrinus,) there are no more than 400 years to be computed from the
beginning of this Epoch, till the time of the Destruction of Troy. Though it
cannot be denied that Pausanias has been industrious in collecting the History
of the Grecian Kings, yet considering that his Relation is not free from
Fables, and incomplete the Times of the Reigns of each of these Kings, being
left out, we have all the Reason in the World to prefer the Authority of
Eusebius in this Case.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Epoch of Cecrops, the first Founder of the Kingdom of
Athens, and his Successors.
1. For want of more ancient Monuments of Antiquity concerning the Epoch of
Cecrops, its Origin must be investigated, partly out of Eusebius, partly out of
the Asiatick Chronicle, which being come to light but some years ago, is known
by the Name of Marmora Arundeliana. 2. The time of Cecrops is coincident with
that of Moses, according to In Chron.
Eusebius and Eustachius, In Hexamer.
Bishop of Antiochia. 3. According to Eusebius there are 375 years from the
beginning of the Reign of Cecrops till the time of Mnestheus. 4. According to
Pausanias, the same Number of years ought to be accounted from thence to the
Destruction of Troy. 5. The Succession of these Kings ought to be regulated in
such a manner as to make the Destruction of Troy coincident with the last times
of the Reign of Mnestheus, the said City being taken by the Greeks in the 22 d
year of his Reign, according to the Marmora Arundeliana. 6. According to the
Computation of Clemens Alexandrinus Theseus reigned near fifty years before the
Destruction of Troy. 7. Upon these and other Characters Scaliger has founded
his Computation of the beginning of the Government of Athens, which at first
being Monarchical, began in the 3158th year of the Julian Period. Cyc.. 22.. 4.

of the Epoch, the Product will be correspondent to the year of the Julian
Period.

concerning the beginning of this Epoch; the last putting the beginning of the

two ancient Historians is scarce to be decided in our times. Concerning some
other Difficulties in the Chronology of the Athenian Kings, Petacius In Ration.

Surname of Cecrops.
the Etymology of the Word Diphyes, the Surname of Cecrops, Some will have him
to have been a Monster, as L. 3.
Apollodorus; others, of a Human Shape, but a prodigious Bulk. According to
Chron. Par. prior.
Eusebius he was called Diphyes, either by reason of his Tallness, or because
he was born an Egyptian, and understood both that and the Greek Tongue.
Demosthenes says, that he was reputed to have been half a Man and half a
Dragon; because he was compared for his Prudence to a Man, for his Strength to
a Dragon.

were introduced at Athens, according to Chron. ad Olym. 24.
Eusebius and Pausanias. Nine of the principal Men of the City were elected
yearly to have the Administration of the Government. He that was the Governor
in chief, and in whose Name all Affairs of Moment were transacted, was called
Archon Eponymus; the six following, Thesmodethae, the eighth a King, the ninth,
Polemarchus; of which Postellus may be consulted.

CHAP. IX. Of the Epoch of the Israelites leaving of Egypt.
1. The Beginning of this Epoch was at the Entrance of the 431st year of the
sojourning of th Israelites in Egypt, which Interval was its first Origin to
the Vocation of Abraham Exodus 12. v. 40.
. 2. The same year was the 480th, to count backward from the beginning of the
Epoch of Solomon Gal. 3. v. 16, 17.
. 3. It was likewise the 46th year before the Distribution of the Land of
Canaan by Lot, which was the first Sabbatic and Jubilean Year 1 Reg. 6. v. 1.
. 4. Moses was at the time of the Israelites going out of Egypt 80 years of
Age Exodus 7. v. 8.
. 5. The Month when the Israelites went out of Egypt was the first in the
Ecclesiastical year of the Jews, called Nisan, and began the New Moon next to
the Vernal Aequinox Exodus 12. v. 2.
. 6. The Day of their going out of Egypt was on the Full Moon, the 15th of
Nisan, beginning in the Evening of the Passover Numb. 33. v. 3.
. 7. In the Hebdomadic Cycle it has for its Character the fifth Feria; because
the 22 d Day of the Month Jiar was the seventh Feria Exodus 16. v. 1. sequ.
. 8. According to these Characters it is evident that the Jews kept their
Passover in the 3217th year of the Julian Period, Cyc.. 25.. 6. on the 16th day
of April, about Sunset, and went forth out of Egypt very early the next
Morning, and kept their Sabbath on the 23 d day of May, when they collected the
Manna; and on the 5th day of June the Law was promulgated in the Mount of Sinai
Ex. 19. v. 20.
. 9. If therefore 3216 years and 3 Months be subtracted To find out the Year
since the beginning of this Epoch.
from any certain Year of the Julian Period, the Residue shows the year since
the beginning of this Epoch. And if this Residue be added to these 3216 years,
the Product will be correspondent to the year of the Julian Period.
. 1. THere are some who maintain that the year of the going of the Children
When the Sabbatic Year began.
of Israel out of Egypt has been the third in the Sabbatic and Jubilean Cycle:
But Diss. de Agn. Pasch. ^4.
Dorsheus has sufficiently demonstrated that the true Origin of the Sabbatic
Year is not to be looked for till 46 years after, when the Israelites being put
in the Possession of the Land of Canaan, distributed the same among themselves
by Lot.

. 2. And Moses does not make an exact Mention The Jews went out of Egypt on
the 15th of Nisan.
of the time of the New Moon, next following after the Vernal Aequinox, in the
beginning of the Month of Nisan; but most of the ancient Writers agree in this
Hypothesis with the modern Authors, that the Passover which was instituted at
the time of their going out of Egypt, was celebrated by the Jews on the 15th
Day of the Month of Nisan, when the Moon was at the Full, as has been
sufficiently demonstrated by Lib. 3. c. 10. Antiq.
Josephus; by Philo, (who was contemporary with Christ) in many Places; by Lib.
7. c. 31.
Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History; and among the Moderns, by Lib. de not.
rer. c. 61.
Beda.

. 3. Moses is also silent as to the exact time The celebrated the Passover at
the time of the F. Moon.
of the Full Moon, when the Jews celebrated the Passover; but since he has been
very careful in mentioning the End of the fourteenth and the beginning of the
fifteenth day of the Month of Nisan: For the celebrating of the Passover it
seems in my Opinion to include the Character of the F. Moon. Of this Opinion
are ^i^. 3. Hist
Nicephorus Beda and Lib. 3 de vit. Mos.
Philo.

. 4. There is likewise a Dispute betwixt the Whether they celebrated it on the
^ th or 15th day of Nisan.
Chronologers, and betwixt these and the Interpreters of the Holy Scripture,
whether the time of the Passover, which is the beginning of the Epoch, of the
Israelites going out of Egypt, ought to be fixed on the fourteenth or
fifteenth day of the Month of Nisan. It is our Opinion that the Ancient Jews
did celebrate their Passover in the Evening* at the end of the fourteenth, and
the beginning of the fifteenth day of the Month of Nisan. 1. Because the day of
their going out of Egypt is mentioned to have been the fifteenth of the Month
of Numb. 33. v. ^.
Nisan; from whence it is evident that according to the Jewish Institution they
celebrated the Passover on the same day. 2. From the Hebrew Text: the Words are
as follows; ^xod 12. v. 5, 6.
Your Lamb shall be without Blemish, of the first Year; you shall take it out
from the Sheep or Goats: and you shall keep it up till the fourteenth day of
the same Month; and the whole Assembly of the Congregation of Israel shall kill
it in the Evening. 3. From the Computation of the days of Unleavened Bread, the
Words of the Institution of this Feast are these: Ex. 12. v. 17.
And you shall observe the Feast of unle^vened Bread: for in this self same day
have I brought your Armies out of the Land of Egypt; therefore shall you
observe this day in your Generations by an Ordinance for ever. In the first
Month, on the fourteenth day of the Month, at Even, you shall eat unleavened
Bread, until the one and twentieth day of the Month at Even. Which Words
plainly intimate, that the Feast of the Unleavened Bread ended on the one and
twentieth Day of the Month of Nisan in the Evening, it being likewise said in
the following Verse; Seven Days shall there be no Leaven found in your House.
It is very evident from thence, that the beginning of the Days of the
Unleavened Bread ought to be fixed on the End of the fourteenth Day of the
Month of Nisan, or on the Beginning of the fifteenth, to count from Sunset.
And it is sufficiently demonstrable out of many Passages in Exodus 12. v. 6. 17.
Holy Scripture, that the Feast of the Unleavened Bread, and of the Passover
began on the same (...). That which has occasioned this difference among the
Chronologers is, that since that time the Jews have begun their Months from the
New Moon; so that the same day which before was the fifteenth, was afterward
called the fourteenth day of the Month Nisan.

. 5. The Chronologers do disagree in their The Israelite^ went out of Egypt on
the 5th ^eria.
Opinions concerning the Character of the Feria, when the Israelites went out
of Egypt. There are many, among which are Henricus Buntingus, Hicronymus
Zanchius and Hamlinus, who maintain this day to have been the seventh Feria:
They allege in their behalf the Words in Deuteronomy: C. 5. v. 15.
Remember that thou wast a Servant in the Land of Egypt; and that the Lord thy
God brought thee out thence, through a mighty hand and a stretched out Arm;
Therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath Day. Lib. 2. c.
^. de an Christ. p. 263.
William Lange determines the Day of their Departure out of Egypt to have been
the fifteenth of Nisan, the fifth Day of April according to the Julian
Calendar, the first Day of the Unleavened Bread, and the sixth Feria, which he
pretends to prove from the Authority of the Seder Olam Rabbah, or the great
Hebrew Chronicle; with whom, in some measure consents Lib. 1. p. 53. demonstr.
Chronol.
Temporaritis. But the most general Opinion is, that the Jews began their
Passover, and went out of Egypt on the fifth Feria, to commence the Day from
the Sunset. Besides, many of the Ancients, among the Modern Chronologers, L.
3. Can. Isag. p. 282.
Josephus Scaliger, Lib. 2. Tit. 3. Cap, 1.
Behmius in his Chronological Manuduction, Dorsheus, Frankenbergerus, and
Calvisius agree in this Point; because it has most evidently appeared out of
the Astronomical Calculations, that in the first year of the Departure of the
Israelites out of Egypt. the Passover which was celebrated at the Full Moon
was coincident with the fifth Feria; and the same Character is correspondent to
what is related in Exodus in the sixteenth Chapter: For if the two and
twentieth day of the second Month (called Jiar) was the seventh Feria, it must
needs follow, that the fifteenth of the Month of Nisan was the fifth Feria. For
betwixt the twenty second Day of the Month Jiar and the fifteenth of Nisan are
thirty seven Days; which, if divided by 7, the Residue is two Days; which if
subtracted from 7, there remains 5; which demonstrates the fifteenth Day of the
Month of Nisan to have been the fifth Feria: That the 23d of the Month of Jiar
was the seventh Feria, is evident out of the abovementioned sixteenth Chapter
of Exodus, where it is said, that on the fifteenth Day of the second Month
(Jiar; they came unto the Wilderness of Sin; the same Day they murmured against
Moses, and in the Evening the Quails came up and covered the Camp; and the next
following Day being the sixteenth, before Sunrising they were blessed with the
Manna for six Days together; to wit, the 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st.
The last Day they gathered twice as much as the other Days; because of the Rest
of the Sabbath of the next following Day being the 22d and the seventh Feria.
But to give you a more exact Idea of such Matters as have a Relation to the
Chronology of this Epoch, the following Table represents the three first
Months of the Year of the Israelites Departure out of Egypt, and their
Congruity with the Julian Calendar.

and leave off again at eleven (about five with us.)

CHAP. X. Of the two Epocha's of the Division of the Land of Canaan among the
Tribes of Israel, and of their first beginning to cultivate the Ground.
1. They first began from that time after they Israelites had passed the River
of Jordan, and made themselves Masters of the Land of Canaan Numb. 33. v. 51.

. 2. At which time all the Tribes had their particular inheritance assigned
them Numb. 34. v 1. seque
. 3. The year of this Distribution was the 45th after the second, from the time
of their going out of Egypt, as is evident from the Words of Jos. 14. 7. 16
Caleb: Forty Years was I when Moses the Servant of the Lord sent me from
Kadesh-Barnea to espy out the Land; and I brought him word again as it was in
mine Heart. And now behold the Lord has kept me alive as he said, the 45
years, ever since the Lord spoke this Word unto Moses, while the Children of
Israel wandered in the Wilderness; and now I am this day eighty five years old
Vid. Number. 1. and 13.
. 4. The year of the Distribution of the Land was the last Sabbatick Year in
the Proleptick Cycle; and the following was the first in the Sabbatick Cycle,
according to God's Institution. Lev. 25. v. 2.
When you come into the Land which I give you, then shall the Land keep a
Sabbath (Rest) unto the Lord; Six years thou shall sow thy Field, and six years
thou shall prune thy Vineyard, and gather in the Fruit thereof: But in the
seventh year shall be a Sabbath of Rest unto the Land, a Sabbath for the Lord;
thou shall neither sow thy Field, neither prune thy Vineyard Vid. Ex. 23. v.
10, 11. and Deuteronomy 15. v. 1, etc. 31. v. 9.
. 5. From these Characters we conclude, that the year of the Division of the
Land was coincident with the 3261st year of the Julian Period, Cycl.. 15.. 14.
And that the first year of cultivating the Ground began in the Month Tisri, or
first Autumnal Month of the same year of the Julian Period. 6. If therefore
3261 years and 9 Months be subtracted Any year given of the Julian Period to
investigate the year since the beginning of this Epoch^.
from any certain year of the Julian Period, the Residue shows the Year since
the beginning of the Epoch of the Division of the Land of Canaan; and if 3262
Years and 9 Months be subtracted from the same year of the Julian Period, the
Residue shows, that since the beginning of the Epoch of the cultivating of the
Land. And if these several 3261 and 3262 years be added to the years of the
before-named Epocha's, the Product will be correspondent to the year of the
Julian Period.

Dionysius Petavius in Opposition to Whither the beginning of the Sabba tick
Year may be gathered from the Words of Caleb.
Scaliger, maintains, that from the Words of Caleb no exact Computation can be
made as to the year of the cultivating of the Land, it being dubious whether
the same ought to be accounted from the Beginning or End of the forty sixth
year after the Departure of the Israelites out of Egypt; But besides, that the
Perspicuity of the Words of Caleb is an undeniable Argument against Petavius,
it is evident that the year of the Distribution of the Land was a Sabbatick
Year; and that of the cultivating of the Land the first of both the Sabbatick
and Jubilean Cycles.

Laurentius Codomannus, L. 3.
Johannes Different Opinions concerning the Epoch of cultivating the Ground.
Temporarius, in his Chronological Demonstrations, Jacobus Capellus, and
several other modern Chronologers, are of Opinion that the first year of the
cultivating of the Land was the fortieth after the Departure of the Israclites
out of Egypt; at which time Joshua being declared Successor to Moses, they
passed Jordan, and the Manna ceased. But it seems very improbable to me, that
the Jews should immediately after their passing that River, have begun to
cultivate the Ground before they were in possession of any considerable part of
it; and that in a fertile Country, where, without question, they found the
Cities and Country stored with all manner of Necessaries for their Sustenance.

among the Jews, the Author pretends to evince, that the Division of the Land
was not made till seven years after the six and fortieth year after the going
out of Egypt; but they are mere Jewish Trifles, not deserving a Place here, as

CHAP. XI. Of the Epoch of the Destruction of TROY.
1. This Epoch being much involved in Fables and Poetical Fictions, the same
must be carefully distinguished from the true Historical Rel^tions; so that not
all that has been left us by Antiquity of the Destruction of Troy, ought to be
looked upon as fabulous; neither the true History be commaculated with the
Fictions of the Poets.

2. Care ought to be taken that the time of the Destruction of Troy be not
confounded with that of the beginning of the War, it being evident out of L. 2.
Aenied.
Virgil that it was not taken till after a War of ten years.

-- captique dolis, lachrymisque coactis,
Quos nec Tydides, nec Larissaeus Achilles,
Non anni domuere december, non mill carinae.
The whole War lasted ten Years, six Months and twelve Days.

3. According to the Testimony of Timaeus in Censorinus from the first
Olympiad, which began in Summer, to account backwards to the Time of the
beginning of the Trojan War, are 417 years.

4. From the Destruction of Troy to the first Olympiad, are 408 years. From the
Trojan War, says L. 1. Bib.
Diodorus Siculus, to the time of the Return of the Heraclides, I compute 80
years, from thence to the first Olympiad, 328 years.

5. Soon after the Destruction of Troy, Aeneas with some of his Countrymen
arrived in Italy; from whom the People of Rome had their first Offspring,
according to St. L. 3. c. 2. de Civ. Dei. c. ^.
Austin. It ought not to be passed by in Silence here, says Solin*, that Aeneas
in the second year after the Destruction of Troy came into Italy with 600 of
his Countrymen, and pitched his Tents near Laurentum.

6. The Arcades, Pelasgi, Epeans and Eleans, as also the Trojans, were those
Nations that laid the first Foundation of Rome, in the 402 d year after the
Destruction of Troy, in the 7th Olympiad, according to Romans An^. L. 2.
Dionysius Halicarnassaeus and Velleius Paterculus.

7. The Trojan War and the Destruction of that City happened under the Reigns of
Priamus King of Troy and of Menelaus King of Lacedaemon; the first had a Son
called Alexander (otherwise Paris) who carried away Helen from her Brother
Agamemnon.

8. The Destruction of Troy happened in the last year of the Reign of Agamemnon,
according to L. 2. Chr. 11.
Eusebius.

9. Mnestheus King of Athens was present in the Trojan War, according to L. 1.
Strom.
Clemens Alexandrinus.

10. From the Nativity of Moses till the Destruction of Troy, are near 400
years, as L. 10. de pr^p. Evang. Cap. ^.
Eusebius has computed it.

11. From the Destruction of Troy to the End of the Peloponnesian War, when the
Athenians obtained the Principality in Greece, are according to the Computation
of Lib. 14
Diodorus Siculus 779 years.

12. From the Destruction of Troy till the year which preceded the beginning of
the Reign of Agathocles the Tyrant, are computed 866 years, But Agathocles
began to reign at Syracusa when Demogenes was Archon (or Prince) of Athens* and
L. Photius and M. Tostius Consuls of Rome Diod. Sic. Bibl. l. 19.
.

13. From the Destruction of Troy, till the time of Lactantius, who writ in the
year 287 after the Birth of Christ are 1470 years according to L. 1. de falls.
Relig.
Lactantius himself.

14. All the Ancients agree in Opinion, that the Destruction of Troy happened in
the beginning of the Summer Quarter, as among others, is evident out of L, 3.
Aeneid.
Virgil.

Postquam res Asiae, Priamique evertere gentem
Immeritam visam superis, ceciditque superbum
Ilium, and omnis humo fumat Neptunia Troja:
Diversa exilia, and desertas quaerere terras,
Auguriis agimur divum: classemque sub ipsa
Antandro and Phrygiae molimur montibus Idae,
Incerti quo fata ferant, ubi sistere detur:
Contrahimusque viros. VIX PRIMA INCEPERAT AESTAS.
Et Pater Anchises dare fatis vela jubebat.
15. The Month of Thargelion was always accounted unfortunate among the
Barbarians; because on the four and twentieth day of this Month Troy was
believed to have been taken, according to Ephorus, Callisthenes, Damasthes,
Philarchus and Plutarch in the Life of Camillus.

16. The time of the Day when the victorious Greeks entered the City of Troy, is
indigitated by Lib. 2. Aen.
Virgil.

Vertitur interea coelum and ruit Oceano nox,
Involvens umbra magna terramque populumque,
Myrmidonumque dolos. Fusi per moenia Teucri
Conticuere: Sopor fessos complectitur artus.
Et jam Argiva phalanx instructis navibus ibat.
A Tenedo, tacitae per amica silentia Lunae,
Littora nota perens.
And soon after,

Invadunturbem somno, vinoque sepultam.

17. From what has been alleged upon the Authority of the best Historians, it
may probably be inferred, that the Destruction of Troy happened in the 3530th
year of the Julian Period, Cyc.. 2.. 15. in the Night betwixt the 11th and 12th
day of June.

18. If therefore 3529 years and five Months be subtracted To find out the year
since the beginning of this Epoch.
from any certain year of the Julian Period, the Residue shows the year since
the beginning of this Epoch; and if the said 3529 years be added to the year
of the said Epoch, the Product must be correspondent to the year of the Julian
Period.

. 1. HOW famous soever the Destruction of Whether the Destruction of Troy be
only a Fable.
Troy is, both among the Greek and Latin Historians, yet there are some who
either call the whole or the greatest part of what the Ancients have left us,
concerning it, in question: Among the first of those was Dio. Chrysostomus, who
relying upon the Authority of a certain Egyptian Priest, relates, that it
appeared out of the Ancient Egyptian Monuments that Helen had been the
Daughter of Tyndareus King of Sparta, and was married to Alexander the Son of
Priamus, King of Troy. That the Greeks out of a Motive of Jealousy of the
Greatness and Power of Troy, had entered into a Confederacy against Priamus; but
with very ill Success, the Trojans having gotten the better of the Greeks in
several Engagements, in one of which Achilles was slain by Hector: One
Metrodorus of Lampsacus, introduced by Tatianus, denies that there were ever
such Persons living as Hector, Achilles, Agamemnon, Helen and Paris; and that
these Names had been only inverited by the Poets to adorn their Fictions. Ital.
Ant. Lib. 3.
Philippus Clu^erius does not absolutely contradict the Destruction of Troy;
but speaks much in Commendation of Dio; and absolutely rejects the Relation of
Aeneas coming into Italy. But though it be undeniable that the Greeks have not
been the most exact in their Annals, which have been much adulterated by the
fabulous Relations of their Poets; yet this cannot be alleged as a sufficient
Reason for the rejecting so considerable a part of History, confirmed by the
Authority not only of the Greeks but of the Latins, and most other Nations. It
is unquestionable that the Ruins of Troy are undeniable Arguments of its
former Greatness, which our Adversaries, to save themselves, pretend to have
been destroyed by Earthquakes and Inundations. But it appears to me
unreasonable to call to our Aid the Elements to maintain the Authority of a
Foreign Egyptian Priest, in Opposition to what has been asserted for Truth by
so many Greek and other Historians.

. 2. Those that contradict the Destruction of Some Arguments for and against
the Destruction of Troy.
Troy, allege also in their behalf, that Homer was both the first Poet and
Author among the Greeks. It is true, that all the Greek Historians, whose Names
have been transmitted to Posterity, have lived some Ages after the Trojan War;
yet is it not from thence to be inferred, that Homer was either the first or
the only Author who has given an Account of the Expedition of the Greeks
against the Trojans. A certain Poet, says Lib. 14. c. 21. var. Hist.
Aelian, whose Name was Syagrus, lived after Orpheus, who first of all brought
the Trojan War into Meter. And what Ovid says of Macro is a sufficient Argument
that there were not wanting among the Latins who endeavored to supply the
Defects of Homer in the Trojan War. These are his Words:

Tu canis aeterno quicquid restabat Homero,
Ne careant summa Troica bella manu.
. 3. As there are some who reject the whole Concerning the Authority of Homer.
History of Troy as fabulous, so there are not wanting such as put Homer in the
same Rank with other Historians. Both are, in my Opinion in an Error, as is
manifest out of what is related concerning the wooden Horse; which, though it
be not only circumstantially described by Homer and Virgil, but also was used
in a Proverbial Sense among the Roman Orators, as is manifest from these Words
of Tully: Out of the School of Isocrates, like out of the Trojan Horse, came
forth a vast Number of great Men: Yet In At.
Pausanias himself is very plain in telling the World that this Horse was
nothing else but a certain Engine invented by one Epeus (a Pattern of which
stood in the Castle of Athens) to batter the Walls of strong Cities: And he
adds, that those who believe otherwise, must needs look upon the Trojans to
have been the greatest Fools and Blockheads in the World: Neither does L. 2.
Aen.
Virgil seem to have been quite ignorant of it, when he introduces Laocoon
speaking these following Words:

Aut hoc inclusi ligno occultantur Achivi,
Aut haec in nostros fabricata est machina muros,
Inspectura domos, venturaque desuper urbi.
. 4. Some are of Opinion that the Destruction Troy was a whole Kingdom.
of Troy was comprehended only in one City; But according to L. 13.
Strabo, the Country under the Jurisdiction of the Trojan Kings consisting in
nine large Principalities, was called Troja; which being invaded and conquered
by the Greeks, they at last made themselves Masters of Troy, the Capital City,
which has, questionless, introduced this Mistake of converting this War, which
lasted in all ten years, into a Decennial Siege.

. 5. This Epoch was so famous in most ancient The Destruction of Troy was much
celebrated among the Ancients.
time, that if we believe Pr^^em. ^ 1.
Diodorus Siculus, this was the first Term unto which the Greek Historians
related their most ancient and remarkable Transactions. And what has rendered
this Epoch the more famous to Antiquity, is, that the Conquest of Troy was
bought with the Loss of so many brave and great Heroes; from whence is arisen
the Proverb (...), thus expressed by Catullus:

Troja nef^s, commune sepulchrum Europae Asiaeque
Troja virum and virtutum omnium acerba cinis.
. 6. The Chronologers disagree also as to the true time of this Epoch: for
besides the various Different Opinions concerning this Epoch^.
Opinions alleged by Clemens Alexandrinus, Porpoyrius has made the Destruction
of Troy coincident with the Reign of Semiramis; as on the contrary, In Chron.
Cap. 34.
Johannes Georgius Herwart ab Hohen^urgh has put no more than seven Ages
betwixt the Destruction of Troy and the Epoch of Christ But, to set aside
these extravagant Notions, there are three several Opinions more, which carry
with them the greatest Probability. The first fixes the taking of Troy in the
3530th year of the Julian Period; which is also our Opinion (for Reasons
alleged in the beginning of this Chapter) as well as of Dionysius Petavius and
Jacobus Capellus. The second is of Josephus Scaliger with his Followers
Calvisius and Emmius, who affirm that Troy was destroyed in the year 3531 of
the Julian Period, on the 22d of June, in the year of the World 2767. The Third
Opinion is of Buntingus, who maintains that the Destruction of Troy happened in
the year of the World 2787, in the year of the Julian Period 3532, on the 21st
of June.

. 7. As the greatest part of the Trojan History is involved in great Obscurity;
so its time remains Kings of Troy
as yet undetermined, we being ignorant how long Teucrus reigned over that
Kingdom. Out of the following Table it will appear that from the time of
Dardanus, Son-in-law to Teucrus, till the Destruction of Troy under Priamus,
there was a continual Succession, from Father to Son, of six Kings for 296
years.

Years. An. Pe. Jul. 1. King Teucrus, -- 2. Dardanus, his Son-in-law, 65 3234

to the Destruction of Troy, 296 3530

. 8. There is also a great Dispute who was the Founder of the City of Troy or
Ilium. The first Founder of Troy.
The common Opinion is, that Ilus the Son of Tros was the Founder of this City,
according to which Supposition Troy has not stood an Age and an half. Of this
Opinion is L. 13. Geor. de Regn. Troj. p. 174.
Strabo and Conon in Photius. Reinerus Reineccius, with some others, attribute
it to Tros. Others go back as far as to King Dardanus, to whom they give the
Honor of having laid the first Foundation of Ilium or Troy; with whom consents
L. 5. Aen.
Virgil when he says thus:

Dardanus, Iliacae primus pater urbis and auctor Electra ut (Graji perhibent)

CHAP. XII. Of the Epoch of the Reign of David and his Successors in both
Kingdoms of Judah and Israel.
1. The beginning of the Reign of David is coincident with the 30th year of his
Age 2 Samuel 5. v. 4. 3.
. 2. The first year of this Epoch precedes the Death of David 40 years Ibid.
Chron. 3. v. 4. c. 30. v. 27.
. 3. The 44th year of this Epoch, or the fourth of the Reign of Solomon is
coincident with the 480th year after the going of the Children of Israel out of
Egypt 1 Reg. 6. v. 1.
. 4. The same 44th year is the year of the building of the Temple of Solomon 1
Reg. 6. v. 1.
. 5. The 81st year of this Epoch is the first of the Reign of Jeroboam, and of
the 390 years of the Iniquity of the House of Israel; because Solomon and his
Father reigned each 40 years Ezec. 4. v. 5.
. 6. The Reigns of the Successors of David in both Kingdoms ought to be
regulated according to the true Synchronism of the sacred Writ, the years of
their Reigns being involved in no small Difficulties. From whence it is
apparent that the first year of David 's Reign is coincident with the 3654th
year of the Julian Period, Cycl.. 14.. 6. 7. If therefore the 3653 years be
subtracted from To investigate the Year since the beginning of this Epoch.
any certain year of the Julian Period, the Residue shows the year since the
beginning of this Epoch; and if 3653 be added to the Number of years of this
Epoch, the Product is the year of the Julian Period.
. 1. THE Interval betwixt the 3260th year of Difficulties concerning the
Nativity ^f David.
the Julian Period when the Jews first conquered Palestine, and the 3624th year
of the Julian Period when David was born, being of above 360 years, and to be
divided betwixt Salmon, Boatz, Obed and Jesse, involves the Nativity of David
in no small Difficulty. For the Genealogy of the Ancestors of David, is thus
represented Ruth 4. v. 2^. seque
: And Nashon begot Salmon, and Salmon begot Booz, and Booz begot Obed, and Obed
begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David. So that every one of these must be supposed
to have begot Children when they were near 100 years old; it being evident that
Nashon entered Palestine with Joshua. Numb. 1. v. 7. c. ^. v. 3. c. 7. v. 12.
Lyra, Salianus, Genebrardus, Catharinus, Jansenius, Esthius, and their
Proselytes, to remove this Difficulty, have substituted two more of the same
Name with Boaz, but in vain, since the same Genealogy is repeated in three
several other Places, to wit, 1 Chronicles. 2. v. 11, 12. in St. Matthew. 1. v. 4. in
St. Luke 3. v. 32. Our Opinion is, that without having Recourse to these
Tergiversations, it may rationally be supposed, that the Ancestors of David
begot Children in their old Age, as it is evident in Boatz out of the Book of
Ruth C. 3. v. 10.
, and in Obed out of 1 Samuel 17. v. 12.

. 2. There being a seeming Contradiction in Difficulties concerning the Kings
of Judah and Israel.
the Chronological Computation of these Kings in the Hebrew Text, Dionysius
Petavius, Alstedius, Torniellus, Buntingus, and several others believe the same
to have been adulterated. But this being the way to dissect, but not to
dissolve the Knot, it will be more convenient to find out some other way to
reconcile these Differences. It is therefore observable, that in this
Chronology sometimes the incomplete years are taken for complete ones: as for
Instance, when Jeroboam is said to have reigned 22 years, is to be understood
of 21 complete years, at the beginning of the 22d. Thus it is also to be taken
with the 24 years attributed to 1 Reg. 15. v. 33.
Baasha instead of 23; with the 12 years of 1 Reg. 16. v. 23.
Amri instead of 11, etc. In other Places, instead of the incomplete years
expressed, the complete ones ought to be understood. As for Instance, when it
is said that 1 Reg. 15. v. 9.
Asa began his Reign in the 20th year of the Reign of 1 Reg. 14. v. 20.
Jeroboam, is to be taken in this sense; that he began his Reign at the
beginning of the 21st year of Jeroboam. In some Passages it appears that
several, but especially Father and Son reigned at the same time: so it is said
of 1 Reg. 15. v. 25.
Nadab, that he reigned in the first year together with his Father Jeroboam: Of
1 Reg. 16. v. 8.
Ella, that he reigned at the same time with his Father Baasha. The same is
said of 1 Reg. 22. v. 52.
Ahaziah and Ahab; of Jehoshaphat and Jehoram, 2 Reg. 3. v. 1. Of this there is
an evident Example in 1 Reg. 16. v. 21.
Amri, who is said to have reigned 12 years; to wit, including the time that
Thibni assumed the Royal Dignity. It is further observable, that in the
Chronology of these Kings the Computation begins not always from the beginning
of their Reigns, but from some remarkable Epoch or Revolution: As, it is said
that 2 Chronicles. 16 v. 1.
Baasha came up against Ramah in the 36th year of the Reign of Asa, when it is
evident that he died in the six and twentieth year of the Reign of Asa 1 Reg.
v. 6. 8.
some interpret thus; that here is to be understood the 36th year since the
Division of the Kingdom after Solomon's Death; as if it had been expressed
thus: In the thirty sixth year after the Division of the Kingdom, of which Asa
was King. There are also some Footsteps of certain Vacancies of the Throne
betwixt Amaziah and Azariah the Kings of Judah, and betwixt Jeroboam and
Zacharias Kings of Israel. All which we leave to the Choice and Decision of the
judicious Reader.

. 3. There is no better way to reconcile the How to reconcile these Differences.
Chronological Differences about the Kings of Judah and Israel, than by making
a due Comparison betwixt the Synchronisms and Combinations of Years of the
several Kings of both these Kingdoms. The following two Tables exhibit at the
same instant the Mutual Connection of the Reigns of these Kings, according to
the Tenure of the Sacred Scriptures: But because the Years of their Reigns are
not always correspondent to this Connection, I have added those other Years,
which, by reason of their Usefulness in reconciling these Differences, I have
called the Chronological Years.

CHAP. XIII. Of the Epoch of the Temple of SOLOMON.
The exact time of the building of the Temple of must be determined according
to the Sacred History, where we read these following Words: 1 Reg. 6. v. 1. 10.
And it came to pass in the four hundred and fourscore year after the Children
were come out of the Land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's Reign over
Israel, in the Month Zif, which is the second Month, that he began to build the
House of the Lord.

The Interval betwixt the going out of the Israelites out of Egypt, and the
time of David (on which depends the Computations of the Epoch of the Temple,
being the fourth year of the Reign of Solomon) ought to be regulated according
to the Genealogy of David, described in Ruth 4. 20. seq. 1 Chronicles. 11. 11.
Matthew. 1. 5. where it is to be observed, that Nashon, who lived and died whilst
the Israelites were in the Desert, Numb. 1. v. 7. c. 7. ^. 12.
begot Salmon, Salmon begot Boatz, and Boatz begot Obed, Obed begot Jesse, and
Jesse David.

This Interval ought also to be regulated in such a manner as not to be
contradictory to the Words of Judge. 11. v. 26.
Jephtha; Whilst Israel dwelled in Heshbon and her Towns, and in Aroer and her
Towns, and in all the Cities that be along by the Coasts of Arnon three hundred
years; why therefore did you not recover them within that time? Which
Computation of Jephtha, according to the Hypothesis of the time of Servitude,
and of the Government of the Jews under the Judges to be accounted by its self
is absolutely false.

Betwixt the fourth year of the Reign of Solomon, the first of the Epoch of
the Temple, till the first year of the Iniquity of Israel, of which mention is
made in Ezekiel. 4. 5. are computed 37 years; because 2 Chronicles 9. v. 10.
Solomon reigned 40 years; and the general Defection of Israel happened under 1
Reg. 12. v. 26.
Jeroboam, the first year after Solomon 's Death.

The first Temple was built by 1 Reg. 6. v. 3^.
Solomon in seven years: And in the elevenh year, in the Month Bull (which is
the eighth Month) was the House finished throughout all the Parts thereof, and
according to all the Fashion of it: So was he seven years in building of it.

From the time of the Foundation of the Temple of Solomon till its Destruction,
which happened in the year of the Julian Period 4124, and 8 Months, are 427 Years
and 6 Months; which Interval is calculated from the fourth year of the Reign of
Solomon till the last year of Zedekiah, out of the Books of the Kings and
Chronicles; in which Opinion agree with us, not only most of the Jewish
Interpreters, but also among the modern Chronologers, Josepus Scaliger,
Henricus Buntingus, Sethus Calvisius, Michael Moestlinus, Henricus Philippi,
Jacobus Hainlinus, and many more.

From these Characters may be collected the beginning of this Epoch, according
to which Solomon laid the first Foundation of the Temple in the year of the
Julian Period 3697, in the Month of May, Cycl.. 12.. 2. and completed the
whole Structure in the 3704th year of the Julian Period, Cycl.. 8.. 18. in the
Month of October.

8. If therefore 3696 years and 4 Months be subtracted from any certain year of
the Julian Period, Any certain year given of the Jul. Period to find the year
since the beginning of this Epoch.
the Residue shows the year since the beginning of the Epoch of the building
of the Temple: And if in like manner 3703 Years and 9 Months be subtracted from
the same year of the Julian Period, the Residue demonstrates the year since the
finishing of the Structure of the Temple of Solomon. But if to the year of
either of these two Epocha's the beforementioned Sums be added, the Product,
corresponds to the year of the Julian Period.

. 1. THere are not a few among the Interpreters Different Opinions concerning
the 480 years.
of the Holy Scripture who are of Opinion that the Calculation of the 480 years
computed a Reg. 6.
to have been betwixt the time of the going out of the Israelites out of
Egypt, till the building of the Temple by Solomon, is erroneous. Serrarius
makes this Interval instead of 480, 680 years; others would have it 580 years;
among whom are Melchior Canus, Johannes Walterus, Nicholaus Raimarus, and Hugo
Grotius: But besides that this pretended Adulteration of the original Text, is
contradictory to the Providence and Promise of God this Computation of 480
years is confirmed by the joint Consent of the Chaldaean, the Greek, of the LXX
Interpreters, the Latin and other Translations.

. 2. Others who are not so forward in Contradicting Others Opinion concerning
the same.
the Authority of the Sacred Writ, and yet disagree with us in our Hypothesis,
are of Opinion, that in the abovementioned Ibid.
Computation of 480 years betwixt the time of the Israelites leaving of Egypt
and the Epoch of the Temple of Solomon, are only accounted the years of each
of the Judges that ruled over Israel, without including the several Intervals
of their Bondage o^ Anarchies. Ludovicus Capellus is of this Opinion; but above
all others, Isag Ch^on c. 7.
Gerhardus Johannes Vossius patronizes this Fiction, alleging from the Authors
of the Sacred History his Intention had been only to give an Account of those
times the Israelites were governed by Moses, Joshua, the Judges and Kings,
without taking any Notice of those Intervals when the Israelites lived in
Servitude, the Memory of which could not but be very dreadful to them. But this
appears to me a very frivolous Reason, since I cannot see why the Time and
Interval might not be inserted with as much Ease as the Relation of the
Servitude it self. Besides that, according to this Supposition, both the Time
and Circumstances of the Destruction of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah must
have been passed by in Silence, they being much more dreadful than the
Anarchies and Intervals of Servitude of the Israelites.

. 3. There are also others who maintain that the Some begin this Interval from
another time.
the Computation of these 480 years ought to be interpreted not from the time
they passed through the Red Sea, but from the time of the Distribution of the
Land of Canaan by Lot; which Interpretation they pretend to prove to be
consonant to the Sacred Historical Phrase from the Words in Deuterenomy 4. v.
44, 45, 46. And this is the Law which Moses set before the Children of Israel.
These are the Statutes and Testimonies, and the Judgments which Moses spoke
unto the Children of Israel after they came forth out of Egypt; on this side
Jordan, in the Valley over against Beth-peor, in the Land of Sihon King of the
Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the Children of Israel smote
after they were come forth our of Egypt. They add to this a Parallel Passage
out of the 115th Psalm, v. 1, 2, 3. When Israel went out of Egypt, the House
of Jacob from a People of strange Language, Judah was his Sanctuary, and Israel
his Dominion; the Sea saw it and fled, Jordan was driven back. Which has
induced Lautentius Codomannus to affirm the abovementioned Term of 480 years
had its Beginning not till that time when the Tribe of Dan had its peculiar
Inheritance assigned to them, according to which Supposition he computes from
the first beginning of the Israelites leaving of Egypt 599 years: and
Sabellicus, Melchior Canus, and Michael Moestlinus account 592 years Dionysius
Petavius Lib. 9. de Doctr. Temp.
computes 520 years, by adding 40 years (the Israelites were in the Desert) to
the 480 years. But Petavius, as well as the other abovenamed Chronologers,
have put a wrong Sense upon the Phrase of the whole Scripture in these two
Passages of Deuteronomy. 4. and Psalm 114; which they allege as Parallel to one
another, there being not intended the least distinct Account of the time of the
Israelites going out of Egypt, but only mentioned in general Terms; it being
evident that the going out of the Israelites out of Egypt is in the Scripture
Phrase to be understood from the time of their passing through the Red Sea. As
for instance, in Numb. 33. v. 38. it is said, And Aaron the Priest went up into
Mount Hor, at the Commandmont of the Lord, and died there in the fortieth year
after the Children of Israel were come out of the Land of Egypt, in the first
day of the fifth Month.

. 4. Dionysius Petavius and some others who pretend to enlarge this Computation
of 480 years, allege that it is contradictory to the Calculation Whether this
Computation of 480 years be contradictory to the Sacred Writ.
of the times of the Judges and Intervals of Bondage of the Israelites: But
these Gentlemen have neglected what has long ago been observed by some
Interpreters, that the Intervals of the Bondage of the Israelites are included
in the times of their Judges; and that sometimes several Tribes have had their
several Judges; so that two or more have been their Heads at the same time. To
confirm which, let us look into the Book of the Judges, c. 4. v. 2. where it is
related that the Israelites lived in Subjection under Jabin twenty years; and
yet in the 4th Verse it is added, And Deborah a Prophetess, the Wife of
Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time. Who can be so much beyond himself as
to suppose that the twenty years of their Bondage ought to be separately
computed besides the time of Deborah; which is confirmed by another Passage in
the the same Book, where it is said of Sampson Judges 15. 20.
be judged Israel in the days of the Philistines 20 years.

. 5. Though it be not always requisite in How the 480 years were divided
between the Kings and Judges.

time when the whole is beyond Question; yet for the better Satisfaction of the
Curious, we will represent in the following Table several Opinions of some of
our modern Chronologers concerning these Intervals.

CHAP. XIV. Of the Epoch of the three hundred and ninety years of the Iniquity
of the HOUSE of Israel, mentioned in Ezec. Chap. 4. v. 5. and seq.
1. The beginning of the Epoch of these 390 years must be fixed at the time of
the General Defection of the People of Israel under the Reign of their King
Jeroboam, of whom it is said frequenth in the Holy Scripture, that he made
Israel t^ sin: But the utmost Period of this Epoch must not be extended beyond
the Destruction of the Temple of Solomon, this being the Intention of the
Prophetical Vision, as is manifest out of Ver. 1, 2, 7, 13, etc. 2. Accordingly
we affirm the first year of this Epoch of 390 years to have been coincident
with the 3734th year, and the last year of the same Epoch with the 4124th year
of the Julian Period. 3. If therefore you subtract from any certain Sum To find
out the year since the beginning of this Epoch.
of years of the Julian Period 3733 years, the Residue shows the year since the
beginning of this Epoch. And if you add the known time of this Epoch to the
said 3733 years, the Product will be equivalent to the year of the Julian
Period.
. 1. BVcholzerus Creutzhemius and some others The Beginning and End of this
Epoch.
begin this Epoch from the fourth year of Rehoboam and Jeroboam; for which
they allege 2 Chronicles. 11. v. 17. Tremellius begins it from the time that
Solomon turned his Heart from the Lord, as Funccius, Codomannus, and some
others, extend its Period till the 23d year of Nebuchadnezzar, or the 5th after
the Destruction of the Temple. But they neglected to take notice that Ezechiel
in this Passage speaks particularly of the Iniquity of the House of Israel,
separately from that of Judah.

. 2. It being expressly said, that 1 Reg. 6. v. 1.
Solomon How long after the building of the Temple this Epoch began.
began to build the Temple in the 4th year of his Reign; and it being likewise
evident that he reigned in all 40 years, it must of necessity follow that the
first year of Jeroboam, who at the same time with Rehoboam immediately succeeded
Solomon, was the 37th year after the beginning of the Building of the Temple,
and consequently the 2734th year of the Julian Period.

CHAP. XV. Of the End of the Reign of Sardanapalus, and the Epoch of the
Median Empire.
1. Sardanapalus was the last, and (according to Diodorus Siculus) the five and
thirtieth Assyrian Monarch, of the same Family with Ninus, descended in a
direct Line and uninterrupted Succession from Father to Son; of which see
Velleius Paterculus. 2. This Sardanapalus being besieged in the City of Ninive,
by Arbaces, was in the third year of the Siege forced to burn himself. Diodorus
Siculus. 1 Reg. 11. v. 4^.
3. This Disaster happened in the 20th year of his Reign. 4. From the time of the
beginning of the Assyrian Monarchy till the fatal End of Sardanapalus are
computed 1300 years, as has been demonstrated before in the Chapter of the
Epoch of the Assyrian Monarchy. 5. Arbaces was the first Founder of the
Monarchy of the Medes; and according to Ctesias, Diodorus, and Eusebius reigned
18 years, who 6. give the following Account of the Succession of the Kings of
Media.
Years. 1. Arbaces reigned 18 2. Mandauces 50 3. Sosarmus 30 4. Artycas 50 5.
Arbianes, otherwise Cardiaceas 22 6. Arsaees, otherwise Dejoces 40 7. Artynes,
otherwise Phraortes 22 8. Astibaras, otherwise Cyaxares 40 9. Apandas,
otherwise Astyages 35

7. The Period of the Empire of the Medes is to be fixed in the first year of
the Epoch of Cyrus the Founder of the Persian Monarchy, about the year 4155 of
the Julian Period, after it had flourished 317 years.

8. Cyaxares, the last King but one of the Medes began his Reign in the 2 d
year of the 37th Olympiad (according to In Chron.
Eusebius.) and reigned 40 years. See Ctes. and Herodot.

9. Under the Reign of Cyaxares the last King but one, or the Reign of Astyages
the last King of Media, there happened a very remarkable Eclipse of the Sun. Of
which Lib. 1.
Herodotus speaking of Cyaxares, This is he, who being engaged in a War with
the Lydians, when they were in the very heat of Battle, the Day turned into
Night. Lib. 1. Stromat.
Clemens Alexandrinus makes also mention of the same Eclipse. Eudemus, says he,
in his Astrological History, affirms that Thales did foretell that great
Eclipse of the Sun which happened at the time when the Medes and Lydians were
engaged in a bloody Battle, under the Reigns of Astyages the Son of Cyaxares
over Media, and of Alyattes the Father of Croesus, over Lydia.

From whence it may be concluded that the Disaster of Sardanapalus happened about
the year 3839 of the Julian Period, which was also the first of the Reign of
Arbaces, that he was succeeded by Mandauces in the year 3866 of the Julian
Period; that about the year 3916 of the Julian Period Sosarmus began his Reign,
whose Successor in the year 3946 was Artycas, who in the year 3997 was
succeeded by Cardiaceas; that after him in the year of the Julian Period 4019
Dejoces began his Reign; in the year 4058 Phraortes, in the year 4081 Cyaxares,
and in the year 4121 Astyages; and that lastly the Empire of the Medes ended
with Astyages in the year 4155 of the Julian Period.

Now therefore by subtracting the several abovementioned Numbers of years of
these Kings from any certain year of the Julian Period, the true time of each
of them since the beginning of their Reigns may be investigated, as may
sufficiently be seen out of the foregoing Examples.

. 1. SVidas, and some others have endeavored to The Etymology of Sardanapalus.
deduce the Etymologies of Sardanapalus from the Greeks; but in my Opinion
Reinerus Reineccius, and many more have with more Reasons sought for its
Orignal among the Assyrians; to wit, from SAR, DAN and NIPHIL, which three
Words signify GREAT, LORD and CONQUEROR; which Title they say he assumed in
the same manner as Attila called himself the SCOURGE OF GOD, and Mahomet the
Turkish Emperor assumed the Title of TERROR OF THE WORLD.

. 2. The Effeminacy of Sardanapalus proved The Occasion ^^ ^he Revolution in
the Assyrian Empire.
the Occasion of the Ruin of the Assyrian Monarchy: For Arbaces Governor of
Media being admitted into his Presence as he was sitting among his Concubines
in Women's Apparel, handling his Needle like the rest, took a Resolution from
that time to withdraw himself from under the Jurisdiction of so Effeminate a
Prince; and being encouraged afterward by the Hopes of Success, by an
Egyptian Priest, famous for his Skill in Astrology, he put his Designs in
Execution, and in a bloody War at last vanquished this Monarch, and became
Master of the Empire.

. 3. Bibl. Histor.
Schotanus is of Opinion that Sardapalus Sardanapalus is not the same Name with
Asser-Haddon.
is the same with Asser-Haddon, who is mentioned 2 Reg. 19. v. 37. and in Es.
37. 38. to have been the Son of Sennacherib. But there are many Reasons to the
contrary: For it is related of Sardanapalus that he lived a very odious and
effeminate Life, according to that noted Epitaph of the Greek Poet Chaerilus.

Cum te mortalem noris, praesentibus exple
Deliciis animum, post mortem nulla voluptas.
Namque and ego cinis ecce, Nini Rex maximus olim.
Haec habui, quae edi, quaeque exaturata libido,
Hausit; at illa jacent multa and praeclara relicta.
Whereas Asser-Haddon, when he began to take the Administration of the Kingdom
in hand, found it in a very ill State, and was forced to wage long and bloody
Wars with the Murderers of his Father. Herodotus, upon whose Authority
Schotanus so much relies, relates that under the Reign of Sardanapalus the
Medians having shaken off the Assyrian Yoke, enjoyed for many Years their own
Laws and Liberty, free from the Oppression of their Kings, till at last Dejoces
reduced them under a more strict Subjection. But from the time that
Asser-Haddon succeeded his Father in the Empire, being the 14th of Hiskiah, and
3999th of the Julian Period, there was but a slender Interval till the Reign of
Dejoces. And since it is evident that both Sardanapalus and Sennacherib were
not unknown to Lib. 2. 2 Reg. 15. v. 19.
Herodotus, it is very improbable that he should not have mentioned the Son.

. 4. Annius and Op. Chron. L. 1. p. 105. 2 Chronicles. 5. v. 26.
Robertus Bailius are of Concerning the Division of this Monarchy.
Opinion that after the Death of Sardanapalus, the Assyrian Monarchy was
divided betwixt Belochus or Belesis and Arbaces; so that the first had for his
share Babylon, and the last Media and Persia. But this is absolutely
contradicted by Diodorus Siculus; who says that this Belochus being a
Babylonian Priest, such as they call Chaldaeans, famous for his great Skill in
judiciary Astrology, who had foretold Arbaces the Conquest of the Assyrian
Empire, was afterward by him made Prefect, or Governor of Babylon.

. 5. The Followers of Annianus, among whom are Sleidan and Nicholaus Reusnerus,
are Whether (...) was the same with Belochus.
of Opinion that Phul, of whom mention is made in the Isag. p. 195.
Holy Scripture, was the same Belochus mentioned by Annianus to have been
Monarch of Babylon. But the contrary may be demonstrated if it be considered
that Sardanapalus lived about the year 3839 of the Julian Period, and that
Menahem the King of Israel was made tributary to Pull the King of Assyria in the
year of the Julian Period 3943, which is above 100 years difference. Besides
that, Pull is dignified with the Title of King; whereas we have showed already
that Belochus or Belesis was only Governor of Babylon.

. 6. Some are very sollicitous about the History of these Assyrian and
Chaldaean Kings, of How to reconcile the Sacred History concerning those Kings
after the Death of Sardanapalus.
whom mention is made in the Scripture after the Death of Sardanapalus; to
which I answer, that it is very probable that after the Death of Arbaces, the
Assyrians might in some measure recover their ancient Liberty, and be governed
by their own Kings, though scarce any Footsteps of them are to be found in
profane History, of which Orosius has given us this Compendious Account: L. 1.
c. 19.
Thus was the Assyrian Monarchy transferred to the Medes; but soon after heavy
Wars were carried on among these Nations with various Success; which to
particularize here, is beyond our Purpose: sometimes the Schytes, sometimes the
Chaldaeans got the upper hand; but the Empire was at last devolved again to the
Medes.

. 7. Herodotus, with some of his Followers, Dejoces was not the first King
after Sardanapalus
make Dejoces the first Monarch of the Median Empire; But, as has been alleged
before, there are other Authors, who having been more careful in inspecting the
Authentic History of the Assyrians, ought to be preferred in this Point before
Herodotus. We have alleged the Words of Diodorus Siculus concerning Arbaces
before; whose Testimony is confirmed by L. 1. c. 3. 4.
Justin, who says expressly that Arbactus (Arbaces) formerly Governor of Media,
was made King after Sardanapalus. And this seems also the most probable, if it
be taken into Consideration, that a Democratical Government appeared in all
Ages contrary to the Genius of the Asiaticks: So that (...) of the Medes, was
used as a Proverb among the Poets; according to Lucan,

Felices Arabes, Mediique, Eoaque tellus,
Quam sub perpetuis tenuerunt fata Tyrannis.
And Virgil Lib. Georg. 4.
speaks to the same purpose, when he describes the Nature of the Bees.

Praeterea Regem non sic Aegyptus and ingens
Lydia, nec populi Parthorum, aut MEDVS Hydaspes
Observant, rege incolumi, men's omnibus una est, etc.
The Observation made by Reinerus Reineccius upon this Passage of Herodotus
seems to be very agreeable to the Truth; to wit, that perhaps the Medes enjoyed
a great share of Liberty under their first Kings; which by degrees being
degenerated into a Licentiousness, Dejoces was the first who re-established the
Royal Prerogative and Authority.

. 8. The Eclipse of the Sun mentioned before out of Herodotus and Clemens
Alexandrinus, has Concerning the Solar Eclipse mentioned by Herodotus.
been like the Pomum Eridis among the Astronomers and Chronologers, there being
as many Opinions as Heads about it, too many to be enumerated here; but have
before all the rest, chosen that of Clemens Alexandrinus and Pliny, who affirm
that this Eclipse of the Sun did not happen (as Herodotus relates) under the
Reign of Cyaxares, but under Astyages, in the year of the Julian Period 4129,
on the 28th of May, toward Sunset, which appeared the more terrible to the
Medes and Lydians engaged in the Heat of Battle, the nearer the Sun was to its
Period.

ours.

CHAP. XVI. Of the Olympiad Epoch.
1. An Olympiad is an Interval of four Greek Years of different Length, at the
Expiration of which the Olympiad Games dedicated to Jupiter Olympicus, were
solemnized among the Greeks.

2. The Olympiad Epoch is confirmed by very famous and unquestionable
Characters, as by several Eclipses related by L. 2. 4. 7.
Thucydides and others From whence it is evident that the Olympiad Epoch began
in the year of the Julian Period 3983, in Summer, Cycl.. 18.. 5.

3. To have a just Connection of the years of the Olympiads with the Julian
Period, subtract one of the Number of the Olympiads, the Residue multiply with
4, unto which add the Number of years of the Running Olympiad; and the Product
will show the time of year since the beginning of this Epoch: If to these you
add 3937 years and 6 Months, the whole will be correspondent to the year of the
Julian Period.

4. But if you have before you the certain year of the Julian Period, and would
find out what year of any Olympiad is correspondent to it, subtract from the
Number of years of the Julian Period 3937 years and 6 Months; divide the
Residue by 4, and the Quotients and Superplus will show the year of the
Olympiad correspondent to it.

. 1. THE first Author of the Olympiad Games is said to have been one Pisus, of
whom The first Founder of the Olympian Games.
nothing is left but the Name. But Pelops the Son of Tantalus is much more
famous in History, who ordered them to be celebrated in Honor of Jupiter
Olympius. They were afterward revived again by Atreus and Hercules, and
dedicated to the Memory of Pelops. Last of all Iphitus the Son of Praxonides
did once more re-establish this Solemnity, after it had been neglected for a
considerable time before; since which time they have been continued without
Interruption, and the Olympian Years were called likewise Iphitaean Years from
Iphitus.

. 2. The Olympiad Epoch is so much celebrated for its Certainty, that some
account the Number of Olympiads among the Chronological Characters, yet is not
free from all Dispute: For, according to the Testimony of Phlegon and In vit.
Lycurg.
Plutarch the Olympian Games were instituted in the time of Iphitus and
Lycurgus. Furthermore Lib. poster. Chron.
Eusebius makes Lycurgus cotemporary with Jehu, and his time coincident with
the 1130th year of the Epoch of Abraham; so that according to this
Computation, Lycurgus and Iphitus flourished about the year of the Julian
Period 3827. Furthermore, most of the Chronologers agree in Opinion with Caius
Julius Solinus, who affirms that Iphitus revived these Olympian Games in the
408th year after the Destruction of Troy. If both these Computations be
compared, it follows from thence, that Lycurgus and Iphitus did flourish both
in the year of the Julian Period 3827, and in the year 3938, which is above a
hundred years difference. To obviate this Difficulty, I see no better Expedient
than to suppose that even after the time of Iphitus the said Games were
sometimes discontinued till the time of Eleus Coroebus, who, according to
Pausanias and Phlegon, was the first who got the Victory in the Race of the
Olympian Games. If any body can show us a more convenient Explication, we are
ready to agree with him in Opinion.

. 3. The Olympian Games are like so many Concerning the Usefulness of this
Epoch.
Annals by which the ancient Greeks have computed not only their own, but also
the Histories of other Nations; from whence Varro has borrowed his three
remarkable Distinctions of Time, (...), before the Deluge; (...), before the
Olympiads, and (...), since the beginning of the Olympian Epoch: And Justin
Martyr and Africanus thus far agree with Varro, that before the time of this
Epoch, nothing of solid History has been written in Greece.

. 4. The Olympian Games were celebrated Where those Games were celebrated.
in the Elean Fields near the River of Alpheus in Peloponnesus, which is now
called Morea. Pausanias relates, that the Pisaeans did also attempt once to
institute the Olympian Games among them, but that the Eleans never reckoned
them among the Number of their Olympiads.

. 5. There is a great difference betwixt an Olympias Of how many years an
Olympiad was composed.
and an Olympian Year: Olympias is called both the Game it self and the
Quadrennial Interval; after the Expiration of which these Games were always
renewed. Some Authors there are however, who have taken it for a Quinquennial
Cycle; as in L. 4. Eleg. 6.
Ovid,

In Scythia nobis quinquennis Olympias acta est.

And In Here. Fur.
Seneca;

Quantus incedit populus per urbes,
Ad novi ludos avidus theatri,
Quantus Eleum ruit ad Tonantem,
Quinta cum Sacrum revocavit aestas.
But in this Passage he seems to speak not of the complete, but running fifth
year: And as for Ovid, it is possible he confounded his Roman Lustrum with the
Greek Olympiad; from whence I conclude that Olympias consisted of four years;
and that an Olympian Year contained the fourth Part of an Olympias.

. 6. The Olympian Games were fixed to a double What time of the year they were
celebrated.
Character; to wit, to that of the F. Moon, next following to the Solstitium
aestivum, or Summer Solstice: But by reason of the Ignorance of the ancient
Greeks in Astronomy, the certain Days of the first Olympiads remain uncertain;
for which reason it is, that Diodorus Siculus* and Pliny have not begun their
Olympian Years from the Summer Solstice; but from the Beginning of the Roman
Civil Year, which has occasioned no small Dispute among the Chronologers, who
did not take notice of this their Method.

. 7. Though it be beyond all Question that the Concerning the Olympian Years.
Olympian Games were regulated according to certain Celestial Characters of the
Sun and Moon; yet were the Olympian Years, separately considered, neither
Lunar, nor Solar, nor Lunae-Solar, but Political Years, consisting sometimes of
360, sometimes of 361, and 362, and again of 390, 391 and 392 Days, etc.

. 8. The Olympian Year consisted of twelve The Olympian Year consisted of 12
Months.
Months, each Month containing 30 Days: Their Names and Order are as follows;

1. (...), (...), or Summer Months. 2. (...), 3. (...), 4. (...), (...). or
Autumn Months. 5. (...), 6. (...), 7. (...), (...), or VVinter Months. 8.
(...), 9. (...), 10. (...), (...), or Vernal Months. 11. (...), 12. (...).

Unto these they added at last two Days, which they called (...); they were
also entitled (...), because it was the Custom in the Grecian Commonwealths
to dedicate these two Days to the Election of their Magistrates.

: 9. The Olympian Years were of two sorts, each of them admitting again of a
threefold Difference: For they were either,

Common Years, consisting of 12 Months, and these are again either (...), of
362 days, of which before. (...) of 361 days, one day being taken out of the
Month Boedromion. (...) of 360 days, 2 days being taken out of the same Month.
Or Embolim^an years, consisting of 13 Mon. by doubling the Mon. Posideon, and
these were again either (...) of 39^ days. (...) of 391 days, one day being
taken out again of the Month Boedromion. (...) of 390 days, one being taken out
of the same Month.

. 10. Some are of opinion that the last Olympiad Concerning the End of this
Epoch.
was celebrated about the year of Christ 312, under the Reign of Constantine
the Great; but Cedrenus affirms that they were continued for a considerable
time after; and the last Olympiad was the 293d, which, according to this
Computation, must be coincident with the year of Christ 393.

CHAP. XVII. Of the Epoch of the building* of ROME.
1. This Epoch must be regulated either according to the Computation of Varro
or Cato. 2. Whereas Cato affirms, that the first Foundation of the City of Rome
was laid in the Spring of the 24th Olympian Year; and Varro, that it was begun
to be built in the Spring of the 23 d Olympian Year; the Connection of this
Epoch must be fixed to one of these abovementioned Olympian Years. 3. The
first Foundation of the City of Rome was laid on the same day the Latins
celebrated their Feast called Palilia.
Accordingly it must be determined, that if we follow the Computation of Cato,
the City of Rome was begun to be built in the year of the Julian Period 3962,
Cycle. 14.. 10. but according to the Calculation of Varro, in the year 3961,
Cycle. 13.. 11, on the 21 day of April.

If therefore, according to Cato, 3961 years and three Months, or according to
Varro, 3960 years and To investigate the year since the beginning of this
Epoch.
3 months be subtracted from any certain year of the Julian Period, the Residue
shows the year since the beginning of the Epoch of the building of Rome: But
if the abovementioned Numbers of Years and Months be added to the time of the
said Epoch, the Product will be correspondent to the year of the Julian Period.

. 1. NOtwithstanding this Epoch is the most Concerning the d^ffer^nce betwixt
C^to and Varro.
celebrated of the whole World; yet is not free from all Disputes, occasioned
by the Negligence of the ancient Romans, who not only before the Times of Cato
and Varro did regulate their Computations by this Epoch (which was not
introduced till five of six hundred years after the Building of the City) but
also afterward did disagree in the true time, there being a whole year's
difference betwixt the Computation of Cato and that of Varro. And Dionysius
Halicarnassaeus goes another year beyond both, and fixes the Epoch of the
building of the City in the 25th Olympian Year; and says, that the first Feast
of the Palilia was celebrated at Rome in the year of the Jul. Period 3963.
These three Authors being of an equal Authority, and it being scarce to be
determined whether the Ancient Roman Records of the Consuls or those of the
Censors ought to be preferred, we will suspend our Judgment in this nice Point.
But it ought to be observed, that Augustus, Claudius, and the other Emperors
in their Proclamations followed the Varronian Calculation; as also Plutarch,
Cornelius Tacitus, Dion, Cellius, Censorinus, Onuphrius, Baronius, and most of
the Modern Chronologers: But the Computation of Cato, Solinus, Eusebius; and
Dionysius Halicarnassaeus himself, as is evident out of his Lib. 2.
Writings. And if we believe Capellus, Cicero, Livy, Pliny and Paterculus,
begin this Epoch promiscuously, sometimes from the Varronian Palilia,
sometimes from the foregoing year, sometimes also from the first day of January
of the following year. See Com. in L. 3* Augustine. de Civ. Dei.
Ludovicus Vives and (d) Jacobus Capellus.

. 2. It is very evident out of the Roman History, The Roman Feast cal^ed
Palilia.
that the Feast called Palilia was one of the most celebrated at Rome,
instituted in memory of the time of the first Foundation of this City,
according to Propertius. (c) Thematism.


Vrbis Festus erat dixere Palilia Patres,
Hic primus coepit moenibus esse dies.
Annua Pastorum convivia, lusus in urbe,
Quum pagana madent fercula divitiis.
Quumque super raros foeni flammantis acervos
Trajicit immundos ebria turba dapes.
Romulus excubias decrevit in otia solvi*
Atque intermissa castra filere tuba.
Which is also confirmed by In Vit. Romuli.
Plutarch. As to the Etymology of the Word Palilia, Servius affirms that Pales
was called by the Romans the Goddess of Forage, whose Feast used to be
celebrated on the 21st day of April, from whence this Feast was called Palilia
in like manner as the Star called by the Modern Astronomers Oculus Tauri, which
in ancient times used to rise about the 21st of April, was also called
Palilicium. There are some others who derive it a pariendo, and in lieu of
Palilia would have it called Parilia.

. 3. It is the common Opinion, that Romulus W^ether Romulus was the first
^^under of Rome.
was the first Founder of the City of Rome; but Lib 1.
Dionysius Halicarnassaeus says, The Historians don't agree neither about the
time, nor the true Founder of the City of Rome. And In Vit. Romuli.
Plutarch speaks much to the Tame purpose; Notwithstanding, says he, the most
glorious Name of this City is so much celebrated among Foreign Nations, it
remains as yet uncertain who was its first Founder. Lib. 3. c. 2, in Ital.
(...).
Philippus Cluverius alleges many more of this kind out of the Ancient
Historians; and concludes, that the fictitious Relation of the Greeks
concerning Romulus and Remus is so gross and palpable as not to be received by
People of Sense. But though it be undeniable that the History of Romulus and
Remus is involved in many fabulous Circumstances, yet cannot this be alleged
as a sufficient Reason to annul the Authority of so many Ancient Historians,
especially since it appears very congruous to the Ancient Chronology, that
about the beginning of this Epoch, from whence the Romans deduce the Origin of
their City, lived one Romulus.

And in another Place, The City of Troy, (says he) the Mother of the People of
Rome. Accordingly there have not been wanting who have deduced the Genealogy of
Romulus and Remus from Aeneas and his Posterity; of which we have given a
Scheme in the following Table; according to the Sentiment of the Poet:

first, of 31 days; April the second, of 30 days; the third was May, of 31 days;
the fourth, June, of 30 days; Quinctilis was the fifth, of 31 days; Sextilis,
the sixth, of 30 days; the seventh was September, of 30 days; the eighth,
October, of 31 days; November the ninth, of 30 days, and December the tenth, of
31 days: The whole year consisting of 304 days. Fenestellus, Licinius, Macro,
and Scaliger, are of Opinion, that from the time of Romulus the Roman Year was
divided into twelve Months: But there are so many of the most Ancient Authors
who confirm by their Authority our Assertion, that it would be superfluous to
allege them here; we will only take notice of the Words of Lib. 1. Fastor.
Ovid:

Tempora digereret cum conditor urbis in anno
Constituit menses quinque bis esse suo;
Scilicet arma magis, quam sidera, Romule, noras,
Curaque finitimos vincere major erat.
Est tamen and ratio Caesar, quae moverit illum,
Erroremque suum quo tueatur, habet.
Quod satis est utero matris, dum prod^ret infans,
Hoc anno statuit temporis esse satis,
Per totidem menses a funere conjugis uxor
Sustinet in vidua tristia figna domo.
And considering that the Genius of Romulus appeared more inclined to warlike
Exploits than Astronomy, it is no great Wonder if he introduced such an
irregular Form of the year, which by reason of its Inconveniences, was altered
by Numa Pompilius.

felt the direful Effects of many dangerous Revolutions but especially when
Alaric, after a long Siege, being at last become Master of it, ruined it with
Fire and Sword, where the Goths exercised such unheard of Cruelties against the
Inhabitants, as if they intended (as Johannes Mariana Lib 4. de reb. Hisp.
expresses it) to revenge upon them all the Injuries the World had received in
former Ages from the Hands of their Ancestors.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the NABONASSAREAN EPOCH.
1. This Epoch is founded upon so-many Characters as are too many to be
inserted here: We will only take notice of two sorts: Among the first are to be
accounted many Eclipses related by Prolemy. To the second Class belongs the
Computation of this Epoch, with Respect to many others, by Lib. de D. Not. c.
21.
Censorinus. 2. From whence it appears that this Epoch begun in the year of
the Julian Period 3967, Cycl.. 19.. 15. on the 26th day of February, on the
fourth Feria, in the Afternoon. But, because there is some Difference betwixt
the years of this Epoch and the Julian years (the Nabonassarean years
consisting exactly of 365 days) the Connection of these two cannot conveniently
be treated of in this place.
. 1. THE Historians, who have frequently made use of this Epoch, yet are
silent The first Foundation of this Epoch.
both as to the Author and the Occasion of its Origin. Thus much is certain;
that its Beginning was either fixed to some remarkable Revolution or great
Victory. The Opinion of Dion. Petav. seems not very improbable; to wit, that
the Babylonians rebelling against the Medes, had chosen for their King one
Nabonassar, whose Successors afterward subdued again both the Medes and
Assyrians.

. 2. Concerning the Name and Author of Of its Founder.
this Epoch there is no small Dispute among the Interpreters. Its Origin is,
without question from the Chaldaean; for NABO signifies Psalm. 46. v. 1.
as much as an Idol, in the Chaldaean Tongue; from whence Nebuchodonosor,
Nebuzaradan, Nabonid, etc. are derived. It is also beyond all question that
Nabonassar has been King of Babylon; but what Funccius, Mercator and others
have affirmed him to have been the same with Salmanassar and Sardanapalus is
contrary to Truth.

. 3. As the Disposition of the Nabonassarean years owes its Offspring to the
Egyptians, so The Usefulness of this Epoch. and the Successors of Nabonassar.
many of the Ancient Historians, but especially Ptolemy, make frequently use of
this Epoch in their Computations; so that there is scare any one Epoch which
is likely to be of more use to those that are curious in Chronology than this,
especially since that an Authentic Catalogue of these Kings has been published
out of a Greek Manuscript of Ptolemy, wherein you may see the true Connection of
the years of the Reigns of these Kings with the years of the Nabonassarean
Epoch. And this Catalogue being looked upon as one of the most Authentic
Pieces in Chronology; unto which we shall have occasion to have Recourse at
several times hereafter I judged it not beyond our Purpose to insert here

CHAP. XIX. Of the Epoch of the Conquest of Samaria by the Assyrians, and the
Destruction of the Kingdom of Israel.
1. Samaria, the Capital of the whole Kingdom of Israel, was taken by the
Assyrians in the sixth year of Hezekiah King of Judah 2 Reg. 18. v. 10.
. 2. In the ninth year of the Reign of Hosea King of Israel 2 Reg. 17. v. 1.

be subtracted 3390 years; or the same Number be added to any certain year of
this Epoch, the Residue of the one, and the Product of the other will show the
year either of the time since the Beginning of this Epoch, or of the Julian
Period.

. 1. IT has been controverted among the Chronologers Wh^ was Shalmanassar
who this Shalmanassar was that conquered Samaria. Chron. part. 2.
Eusebius and Clemens Alexandrinus confound him with Sennacherib. Funccius,
Buntingus, Mercator, and several other of the most Learned Modern Chronologers,
affirm this Shalmanassar to have been the same Nabonassar of which mention is
made by Ptolemy. But this Opinion has been sufficiently refuted by De Emend.
Temp.
Scaliger, by Calvisius, and Behmius. The Celestial Characters fixed by Ptolemy
to the Times of Nabonassar having not the least Relation to this Hypothesis.

. 2. There arises also another Controversy Of the Synchronism of Hosea and
Ahaz.
concerning 2 Reg. 15. v. 30.
Hosea, who is said to have slain Pekah in the 20th year of Jotham, and to have
succeeded him in the Kingdom. The 20th year of the Reign of Jotham was
questionless the 4th of the Reign of Ahaz, who reigned 16 years: So that Hosea
began to reign in the 4th year of Ahaz. But it being said 2 Reg. 17. v. 1. that
in the 12th year of Ahaz, Hosea began to reign, the Question is, how the
beginning of his Reign can be fixed both in the 4th and 12th year of Ahaz? Unto
which it is answered, that the beginning of the Reign of Hosea may be
considered in a double respect. For from the 4th year of Ahaz, till his 12th,
he reigned as Sovereign; whereas after the said 12th year he was tributary to
the King of 2 Reg. 18. v 1-9, 10.
Assyria.

. 3. There is no less Dispute among the Chronologers concerning So the King of
Egypt, of Of King So, mentioned in the H. Scriptu^e.
whom mention is made in the Scripture, whom some call Bochorin Saitin; others
by another Name: But I take it for granted, that Cambyses King of Persia, did,
according to Eusebius and Herodotus, conquer Egypt in the 5th or 6th year of
his Reign; which, according to Ptolemy, was the 225th year of the Nabonassarean
Epoch; or the 4191st year of the Julian Period. I will in the following Table
give you a Catalogue of the Egyptian Kings; which from the year 4191 (to count
backwards) have reigned till the year of the Julian Period 3991 (when the
Destruction of the Kingdom of Israel happened;) from whence it will appear, that
at that time Sabacus the King of Aethiopia reigned in Egypt. In the first
Column you will see the Names, and in the second, the Times of the Reigns of
these Kings; in the third, the year of the Julian Period when they began to
reign, and in the fourth, the last year of each of their Reigns; in the fifth
you will find the several Places cited out of Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus,
which confirm our Assertion. The Pages are cited out of Herodotus, according to
the Edition of Henricus Stephanus, An. 1592; and out of Diodorus Siculus,
according to the Edition of Laurentius Rhodomannus, An. 1604.

forced to quit their Country 947 years after their going out of Egypt, 800
years after the Death of Joshua, and 260 years, 7 months, and 7 days after the
Division of the Kingdom under Jeroboam; But the Computation of Josephus is
contradictory to it self: For according to his Calculation from the time of the
Israelites going out of Egypt, the Destruction of that Kingdom must have happened
in the year of the Julian Period 4163, and consequently later; But according to
his Computation, from the time of the Distribution, of the Kingdom this
Destruction must have happened in the year of the Julian Period 3973, and
consequently sooner than our Epoch. It is therefore our Opinion, that
(according to the Table of the Kings of Judah and Israel which we have given
heretofore) the whole Duration of the Kingdom of Israel from the time of
Jeroboam till the Destruction by the Assyrians, was only of 257 years.

. 5. Concerning the Place whither the ten Tribes of Israel were carried into
Captivity we read Whither the Israelites were carried.
thus in the Holy ^ Reg. 17. v. 6. 18. v. 10.
Scripture: The King of Assyria did carry away Israel into Assyria, and put
them in Habah and in Habor by the River of Gozan, and in the Cities of the
Medes. From whence we conjecture that the Israelites were dispersed in Assyria
and Media, and more especially in those Provinces bordering upon the Caspian
Sea, the Tygris and Euphrates. As to the River of Gozan, I am of Fuller's
Opinion, that the said River is the same which is since called by the Persians,
Cyrus, a River of Media.

. 6. Some of the Ancient Jewish Interpreters Of the River of Gozan.
maintain that this River of Gozan was the Sabbatic River, the Source of which
they pretend to be near Kalicut in the Indies, which, they say is very
boisterous six days in the Week; but during the Sabbath, very calm: But others
look for it in Media.

. 7. One Aaron Levi, alias Antonius Montezini Of the Opinion of Antonius
Montezini.
in his Treatise writ Anno 5404, and dedicated to Manasseh Ben Israel, pretends
to inform the World that in the West Indies he had found out a most prodigious
Number of Jews, who being governed there by their own Laws to this day, were
separated from the other Indians by a great River. But besides that, this
Impostor sufficiently contradicts himself in his Relations, making his
Fellow-Travellour sometimes a Christian, sometimes a Pagan, sometimes a Jew.
Our late Voyages into those Parts have sufficiently detected this Imposture.
Thus much is beyond all question, that in the time of L. 2. c. 5.
Josephus, the Israelites did not inhabit America, but near the River Euphrates.

. 8. Philippus Mornaeus, Leunclavius, Genebrardus, The Modern Tartars are not
the Offspring of the Ancient Jews.
and Postellus in his Description of Syria, are of Opinion, that the Turks and
Tartars owe their Offspring to the Jews, which they conjecture by the great
Multitude of Jews living in Russia, Lithuania, and some other of the most
Northern Parts of Europe; and by some Words, as those of Dan, Zabulon and
Naphthali, which they say are used to this day among the Tartars; the Etymology
of which they deduce from the Syriack Tongue, signifying as much as the
Remainders; and that of Turk as much as an Exile in the Hebrew Language: But
this is contrary to the most Authentic History of those Parts, who deduce the
Origin of the Tartars from the Scytes, the Posterity of Japhat, not of Shem.
And concerning the Etymology of the Words they are egregiously mistaken; and it
seems very strange that Paulus Venetus who lived in the Court of the Great
Tartar Cham, and other Travelers should not have been able to hear the least
of the Danites, Naphthalites, etc. Of the Coloni^ sent by the Assyrian to
Samaria.


. 9. Concerning those Colonies that were sent by the Kings of Assyria into
Samaria, we read thus in the Holy 2 Reg. 17. v. 24.
Scripture: And the King of Assyria brought Men from Babylon, and from Cuthah,
and from Hava, and from Hamah, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the
Cities of Samaria, instead of the Children of Israel; and they possessed
Samaria, and dwelt in the Cities thereof. Among all these the Chutaei were the
most celebrated, according to the Testimony of L. 9. c. ult.
Josephus; Colonies, says he, were sent out of Persia, but especially from the
Country bordering upon the River Cutah, who fixed their Habitations in Samaria,
and the other Cities of Israel.

. 10. The great and noble Asnaphar mentioned Of Asnaphar mentioned in the
Scripture.
in the Holy Ezr. 4. v. 10.
Scripture, is by Reinerus Reineccius and others taken for the same with
Shalmanassar, by others for Sennacherib; But it appears sufficiently out of the
second Verse of the same Chapter of Ezra, that this Asnaphar was no other than
Assarhaddon.

CHAP. XX. Of the Epoch of NABUCHADONOSOR, who is in the Holy Scripture called
Nebuchadnezzar.
1. The beginning of this Epoch is to be regulated in such a manner as not to
be contradictory to the Holy Scripture, to the beforementioned Catalogue of
the Kings of Ptolemy, or the Authentic History of Berosus. 2. The 4th year of

Antiquity of the World, Manethon's Supplement to Berosus, Megasthenes his
Annals of Persia, etc. But his Imposture has been discovered long ago,
especially by the difference there appears betwixt his Chronological
Computations, and those extant in the Fragments of Berosus and Megasthenes.

. 4. Funccius, Moestlinus and Hainlinus are of Whether Nebuchadnezzar and
Nabopolassar are the same.
Opinion that Shalmanassar of whom Mention is made in the Holy Scripture, is
the same with Nabonassar, mentioned by Ptolemy; and that the beginning of the
Babylonian Captivity ought to be fixed to the time of the Destruction of
Jerusalem, and consequently to the 19th year of the Reign of Nabopolassar. But
it is sufficiently apparent out of Berosus that Nabuchodonosor the Son of
Nabopolassar carried the Jews into Captivity; and that Nabuchodonosor is the
same with Nebuchadnezzar.

. 5. And there is an exact Harmony in the Of the time of the Reign of
Nebuchadnezzar.
Computation of the years of Nebuchadnezzar, betwixt the Holy Scripture and the
Fragments of Berosus; to wit, of 43 years: For the first year of the Captivity
of Jehoiachim was the eighth of 2 Reg. 24. v. 12.
Nebuchadnezzar; and the 37th of his Captivity was coincident with the first
year of 2 Reg. 25. 27. Jer. 52. v. 35.
Evilmerodach: From whence it is evident that the foregoing year being the 36th
of the Captivity of Jehoiachim, was the 43d and last of Nebuchadnezzar.

. 6. Besides there is a remarkable Difference in Of the difference of the Names

Administration of Affairs. Herodotus speaks much in Commendation of a certain
Baylonian Queen, called Nitocris, which perhaps may have been the Queen Consort
of Nebuchadnezzar.

. 8. There is also some difference in the Annals Of the difference in the
Annals of these Kings.
of the Babylonian Kings; for the same year which Daniel calls the third of
Jehoiachim, is called by Jeremiah the fourth of Jehoiachim. And in the
Ptolemaean Catalogue Nabopolassar has no more than 21 years assigned him for
his Reign; whereas in the Fragments of Berosus his Reign is extended to 29
years. Unto which we answer, that First, sometimes the incomplete years are
taken for the Complete ones. Secondly, that sometimes two have reigned together
at the same time; And Thirdly, that the Historians have not always been careful
alike in setting down the exact Number of years.

CHAP. XXI. Of the Epoch and Intervel of the 70 years of the Babylonian
Captivity mentioned 2 Chronicles. 36. v. 20, 21. Jer. 25. 11. c. 29. v. 10, etc.
1. This Epoch or Interval ought to be limited according to the Testimony of
the Holy Scripture, in the Chronicles, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. 2. The Beginning
of this Epoch ought to be fixed to that time when the greatest part of the
Jewish Nation, together with their King, were carried into Captivity, 3. When
these were carried away Captives, to whom Jeremiah writ his Epistle, from the
1st Verse to the 11th of the 24th Chapter. 4. When those were carried away
Captives, of whom many returned afterward, ibid. Cap. 25. v. 5.
. 5. When King Jehoiachim was carried into Captivity, to wit, in the 8th year
of the Reign of Nebuchadnezzar 2 Reg. 24. v. 12.
. 6. It was the 9th year of the Captivity when the Babylonian King sat down
before Jerusalem, which was likewise the 9th of the Reign of Zedekiah Jer. 39.
v. 1.
. 7. The first year of the Destruction of the Temple was the 12th of the
Captivity Ezekiel. 33. v. 21.
. 8. The 21st year of the Captivity was coincident with the 4th year of the
Desolation of the Temple of Solomon Ezekiel. 40. v. 1.
. 9. The 5th year of the Captivity seems to be made coincident with the 30th
year of Nabopolassar by Ezekiel C. 1. v. 1, 2.
. 10. In the 70th and last year of the Captivity, Cyrus was Monarch, not only
over Persia, but also over Babylon, and of almost all Asia; so that he might
well make use of these Words: The Lord God of Heaven has given me all the
Kingdoms of the Earth Ezr. 1. v. 2.
.
From whence we conclude, that the first year of the Captivity happened in the
year 4113 of the Julian Period, Cycl.. 25.. 9. and that the said Interval ended
in the year 4183 of the Julian Period.

If therefore 4113 or 4183 years be subtracted from any certain year of the
Julian Period, the To investigate the Beginning and End of this Epoch.
Residue shows the year since the Beginning or End of this Interval. And if the
said Numbers be added to the years of the Beginning or End of this Epoch, the
Product will be correspondent to the year of the Julian Period.

. 1. THere are some who begin this Epoch Of the differences concerning the
true beginning of this Epoch.
of the 70 years Captivity in the 13th year of Josiah, which they end with the
first year of the Persian Epoch, or the Reign of Cyrus. They have been misled
into this Error, because Jeremiah mentions the 13th year of Josiah; from which
time, they pretend, are to be computed 70 years to the beginning of the Persian
Epoch. But it being evident, that in the 70th year after the 13th of Josiah,
Cyrus (though at that time King of Persia) yet was not Sovereign of Babylon; how
could he without the Approbation of the King of Babylon, release the Jews from
their Captivity?

. 2. Behmius, Dionysius Petavius, Robertus Bailius, Whether they began with the
3 d or 4th year of Jehoiachim.
Vossius, Simson, Beroaldus, with their Followers, fix the Beginning of this
Epoch in the 3d or 4th year of King Jehoiachim; but it appears to me, that 1 Chronicles. 36. v. 6.
Jehoiachim was never carried to Babylon as a Captive, but that during the
eleven years of his Reign he only was tributary, or under the Subjection of
Dan. 1. v. 1.
Nebuchadnezzar 2 Reg. 24. v. 1.
, who also made War upon his Son, because the Father had refused to obey his
Commands: so that it was 2 Reg. 24. v. 12.
Jehciachim, who, with the whole Royal Family, and many thousand other Jews,
was carried into Captivity. There is but one Objection of some Moment against
us; which is, that if the Beginning of this Interval of 70 years be computed
from the Captivity of Jehoiachim, the same will not exactly be correspondent in
its Period with the Epoch of Cyrus; but this Objection will be answered
hereafter in its proper Place, when we shall treat of the Babylonian Epoch of
Cyrus.

. 3. Eusebius In Chron.
Sulpitius Severus, Johannes Whether from the first Destruction of Jerusalem.
Funccius and Hainlinus, begin this Epoch of 70 years from the time of the
first Destruction of the City of Jerusalem; but they have been sufficiently
refuted by Man. Chronol. p. 107.
Johannes. Behmius: Besides that, Funccius has founded this Hypothesis upon
another no less erroneous than this; to wit, that Nebuchadnezzar mentioned in
Scripture, is the same with King Nabopolassar of Ptolemy.

. 4. Those who maintain that the Beginning Of the pretended difference betwixt
Jeremiah and Ezekiel.
of the 70 years Captivity is to be fixed in the 4th year of Jehoiachim,
pretend that the two Prophers Jeremiah and Ezekiel differ in their Computation,
as to the Beginning of this Captivity to evince which, they have invented four
several Transmigrations of the Jews; But without entering upon a Dispute
concerning the Reality of these several Captivities, they allege it seems very
improbable that Ezekiel who was cotemporary with Jeremiah, and writ his
Prophefie after him, should have inserted a different Computation from the
first, and have relinquished a certain established Epoch to introduce a new
one, which could not but involve their Prophesies in great Obscurity and
Difficulties. The Character which Ezekiel fixes to his Epoch, when he calls it
Our Captivity, puts the Matter beyond question.

. 5. There is also some Dispute concerning the Of the Passage in Zechariah
Concerning the 70 years.
70 years mentioned by Zechariah C. 1. v. 12. c. 7. v. 5.
: The Words are as follows: O Lord of Hosts, how long will thou not have mercy
on Jerusalem, and on the Cities of Judah, against which thou have had
indignation these 70 years: And, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and
seventh Month, even these 70 years. And since C. 1. v. 1. 7.
Zecharias lived at the time of Darius, and in the 2d year of his Reign had
this Vision, and seems to fix the last Period of the 70 years Captivity to his
time, some have from thence taken occasion to begin this Epoch from the total
Destruction of the City of Jerusalem. But if we consult the original Text, it
will be apparent, that the Prophet does not speak of the 70th year, but of 70
years which were past before the time of the Prophet Zechariah.

CHAP. XXII. Of the Epoch of the Destruction of the Temple of Solomon.
1. The Destruction of this Temple happened in the 11th and last year of King
Zedekiah 2. Reg. 25. v. 2. Jer. 34. v. 2. c* 52. v. ^.
. 2. And in the 11th of the Captivity of Jehoiachim, when Ezekiel was likewise
carried away to Babylon, who in the next following, being the 12th of the
Captivity, was informed of the Destruction of the City Ez. 33. v. 2^.
. 3. And in the 19th, year of the Reign of Nebuchadnezzar 2 Reg. 25. v 8. Jer.
32 v. 1. c. 52. v. 12.
. 4. The year of the Destruction of the Temple was the last of the Interval of
the 390 years of the Iniquity of the House of Israel; so that the last year of
this Interval is coincident with the Destruction of the Temple of Solomon Ez*
4. v. 5.
. 5. In the same year the Jews made a Covenant to observe the Sabbatic Year, in
proclaiming Liberty to their Menservants and Maidservants, according to God's
Institution D^ut 15. v. 13. Jer. 34.
. 6. The year of the Destruction of the Temple ^^ coincident with the third
year of the 57th Olympiad, according to Chron. lib. post.
Eusebius. 7. By the unanimous Consent of the most authentic Historians and
Chronologers, whose Computations are founded upon the true Connection of the
before-enumerated Epocha's, and the Catalogue of the Kings of Judah, the
Destructian of the Temple of Solomon happened in the 428th year after it was
begun to be built. 8. It happened at the same time when VAPHRES whom Herodotus
calls Apries, reigned in Egypt, according to Clemens Alexandrinus and Eusebius,
whose Fall is described by Herodotus consonant to the Prediction of Jeremiah,
who calls this King Pharaoh-hophra C. 44. v. 30.
. 9. The Temple of Jerusalem was laid in Ashes betwixt the 9th and 10th day of
the Month Ab, the fifth Month in the Ecclesiastical Year Jer. 52. v. 12.
. 10. The first Destruction of the Temple happened on the same day of the Month
that the second Temple was burnt by the Roman Soldiers Jos. l. 7. c. 9. 10.
.
From whence we conclude that the Destruction of the Temple of Solomon happened
in the year of the Julian Period 4124, Cycl.. 8.. 1. on the 1st day of August*
^n the 6th Feria.

If therefore 4123 years and 7 months be subtracted from any certain year of
the Julian, the Residue shows the year since this Epoch. And if the Number of
4123 years and 7 months be added to the known year of this Epoch, the Product
will be correspondent to the year of the Julian Period.

. 1. AS it is evident out of Jeremiah, Chap. 34, The Destruction of the Temple
happened in the Sabbatic Year.
that the year of the Destruction of the Temple was a Sabbatic Year: So A^nal.
Sacr.
Laurentius Codomannus, Michael Moestlinus, and Jacobus Hainlinus, make the
same year a Jubilean Year: But their Hypothesis being founded upon the
Manumission of Servants, which according to the Mosaic Law was not only
performed in the Jubilean, but also in the Sabbatic Year, is not convincing
enough to make us adhere to their Opinion: For it is expressly said in Deuteronomy. 15.
1. 12. And if thy Brother, ^ Hebrew Man or Hebrew Woman, be sold unto thee, and
serve thee six years; then in the seventh thou shall let him go free from thee.
See Behmius L. 1. Manud. Chron. p. 79.

. 2. Concerning the Synchronism of the Of Vaphres the Egyptian King.
Egyptian King VAPHRES, and the Destruction of Jerusalem, both Clemens
Alexandrinus and Eusebius do agree: For the first makes the second year of this
King coincident with the seventh year of the Reign of Nebuchadnezzar; and the
second makes the seventh year of the Reign of Vaphres coincident with the
second year of the forty seventh Olympiad with the eleventh year of the Reign
of Zedekiah, with the eighth of Astyages, and the eighteenth of Tarquinius
Priscus; besides that, the History of this King agrees exactly with the
Prophecy of Jeremiah: Cap. 44. v. 30.
Thus sai^^ the Lord; Behold I will give Pharaoh-hophra, King of Egypt, into
the Hand of his Enemies, a^^ into the Hand of them that seek his Life, etc. For
according to Lib. 2.
Herodotus, he was taken Prisoner by Amasis, who headed his rebellious
Subjects, and was strangled by him.

CHAP. XXIII. Of the Persian Epoch of Cyrus.
1. Cyrus began his Reign in Persia, in the 35th year of the Reign of Astyages,
according to Herodotus. 2. In the 29th or 30th year before his death, according
to Herodotus and Ctesias. 3. In the first year of the 55th Olympiad, according
to Diodorus, Thallus, Castor, Polybius, Phlegon, cited by Lib. 10* de Praep
Evang.
Eusebius. 4. The seventh year of Cambyses, which was the 37th since the
beginning of this Epoch, was the 225th of the Nabonassarean Epoch, at what
time there was an Eclipse of the Moon, according to Lib. ^.
Ptolemy. 5. The 20th year of the Reign of Darius Hystalpes, being the 58th
since the Beginning of the Reign of Cyrus in Persia, is coincident with the
246th year of the Nabonassarean Epoch, when there happened another Eclipse of
the Moon, according to Ptolemy. 6. The 31st year of the same Darius Hystaspes,
or the 69th since the beginning of the Persian Epoch of Cyrus was the 257th
year of the Nabonassarean Epoch, when, according to Ptolemy, there happened
another Eclipse of the Moon. 7. The ancient Persian Empire, to reckon from the
first year of the Reign of Cyrus, did stand 728 years according to Agathias.
From these Characters we conclude, that the first year of the Reign of Cyrus
was coincident with the 4155 year of the Julian Period, or at least, with the
latter End of the 4154th year, Cycl.. 10.. 13.

If therefore 4154 years be subtracted from any certain To investigate the year
since the beginning of this Epoch.
year of the Julian Period, the Residue shows the year since the beginning of
the Persian Epoch of Cyrus. Or if 4154 years be added to the known year of the
said Epoch, the Product will be correspondent to the year of the Julian Period.

. 1. BEroaldus, with some others, is of Opinion, Of the Uncertainty of the
ancient Persian History.
that the ancient History of the Persian Empire is involved in so many
fictitious Relations by the Greeks, that it is less difficult in our Eye to
judge of the Truth of that History, than it was at the times of Herodotus,
Josephus, Manetho, Megasthenes, or Ctesias, to whom we are beholding for the
most ancient Monuments of Antiquity in the Persian History. Yet they seem to be
too severe in their Judgment, it being beyond all question, that these, as well
as many others of the ancient profane Historians, have confirmed their
Computations by undeniable Celestial Characters; and therefore not to be
absolutely rejected, by reason of the Mixture of some fabulous Relations.

. 2. There is not any other Epoch which is Of the Certainty of the Beginning
of this Epoch.
so well established by the General Consent of all the ancient Historians in
reference to the time of the Olympiad, than the Persian Epoch of Cyrus, who
all agree, that Cyrus began his Reign in Persia at the time when the fifty five
Olympiad Games were celebrated in Gracia.

. 3. But concerning the time of his Reign, Of the Reign of Cyrus.
and of his Death, there are various Opinions. Lucianus allots him a hundred
years, and Lib. 1. de Di^in.
Cicero threescore and ten; of which he reigned 30 years. But as this Epoch is
founded upon the time of his Reign; So it is sufficient for us to know, that
according to Ctesias, Dionysius, Justin, Eusebius and Clemens Alexandrinus,
Cyrus reigned in all 30 years. Herodotus speaks of 29, and Sulpitius of 31
years.

. 4. There is a remarkable Difference betwixt the Chronological Computations of
Xenophon Concerning the different Opinions of Xenophon and Herodotus about
Cyrus.
and Herodotus concerning the Reign of Cyrus. For Xenophon makes Astyages the
last but one among the Median Kings; whereas Herodotus affirms him to have been
the last. Xenophon relates that Astyages died in Peace when Cyrus was but very
young, leaving the Kingdom to his Son Cyaxares; but Herodotus says, that Cyrus
conquered Astyages. Xenophon says, that the Father of Cyrus was one of the
Princes of Persia, descended from Perseus; and that he had all the Advantages
of a most generous Education in his Father's and Grandfather's Court; whereas
Herodotus makes him the Son of one Cambyses of an ignoble Birth; and that
without the Knowledge of his Grandfather he was educated among the Shepherds.
Xenophon allots no more than 11 years for the Reign of Cyrus; but Herodotus 29.
The first says he died upon his Bed; the last, that he was slain in the War
against Tomyris the Queen of the Massagetes. In answer to which we will allege
the Words of Cicero* Cyropoedia Xenophontis non ad fidem historicam, sea ad
effigiem justi imperii atque optimi principis est conscripta.

. 5. The Dispute is no less great among the Of the Succession of Cyrus and
Daratron of the Persian Empire.
Chronologers concerning the Succession and true Computation of the years of
the Persian Monarchs in order to reconcile the Profane History with the Sacred
Writ. The Jews allow of no more than four Persian Kings mentioned in the
Scripsures: Beroaldus and his Followers don't contract the Persian Monarchy
into so narrow a Compass, allowing 130 years to this Empire, but cannot agree
in the Chronological Computation, and what Character to allot to each of these
Monarchs; as may be seen out of the following Table, set down by Beroaldus.

Cyrus Major. 2. Assuerus Artaxerxes. 3. Darius Assyrius. 4. Artaxerxes Pius.
5. Xerxes the Terror of Greece. 6. Artaxerxes Longimanus. 7. Darius Nothus. 8.
Artaxerxes Mnemon. 9. Ochus. 10. Arses, otherwise Arsanes. 11. Darius
Codomannus, Brother of Arsanus, Son of Ochus.
But if we follow the Footsteps of the Ptolemean Catalogue, of Herodotus,
Thucydides, Ctesi^^, Justin, Diodorus, Berosus, and many others, the following
Table gives an exact Account of the Succession and Chronology of the Persian
Kings:

Complete Years. 1. Cyrus Major, 29 2. Cambyses cum Magis, 8 3. Darius
Hydaspes, 34 4. Xerxes, 21 5. Artaxerxes Longimanus, 43 6. Darius Nothus, 19 7.
Artaxerxes Mnemon. 43 8. Ochus, 23 9. Arses, 3 10. Darius Codomannus, 5 The
Total Sum of the Years of the Persian Kings, 228

. 6. The Character mentioned by In Vit. Alexand.
Of the last Period of the Persian Monarchy.
Plutarch, in the last year of the Reign of Darius Codomannus, much strengthens
our Opinion concerning the Duration of the Persian Empire: For he says, That at
that very time when the last Battle was fought betwixt Darius and Alexander,
there happened an Eclipse of the Moon; which, according to the true Astronomical
Calculation, was in the 446th Olympian Year, or in the second year of the 112d
Olympiad, on the twentieth day of September; which evidently proves the Mistake
of Beroaldus, who affirms, that the Death of Darius happened in the first year of
the 113th Olympiad. If therefore a true Balance be made betwixt the 217th
Olympian Year, being the first of the 55th Olympiad, when Cyrus began to reign
in Persia, and the 446th Olympian Year, it will demonstratively appear, that
the Persian Empire, according to our Assertion, flourished about 228 or 229
years.

CHAP. XXIV. Of the Babylonian Epoch of Cyrus, and the End of the first
Monarchy.
1. Cyrus put an End to the first Monarchy by the Conquest of Babylon, under
the Reign of Darius Medus, who being called in profane History Nabonnedus,
succeeded Balthazar in the Babylonian Empire, according to Berosus, Herodotus,
Ptolemy, and many others. 2. Cyrus marched with a vast Army out of Persia, and
after having carried Fire and Sword through Asia, attacked Babylon in the 17th
year of Nabonnedus, according to Berosus. 3. From the first year of the
Babylonian Epoch of Cyrus till the beginning of the Reign of Cambyses,
according to the Celestial Characters mentioned by Ptolemy, are accounted 9
years. 4. From the beginning of the Nabonassarean Epoch till the time of
Cyrus, are accounted by Ptolemy 209 years.
From these Characters it is concluded, that the first year of the Babylonian
Epoch of Cyrus, mentioned in Profane History was coincident with the 4176th
year of the Julian Period, Cycl.. 4.. 15.

If therefore 4175 years be added to any certain year To find out the year
since the Beginning of this Epoch.
of the Babylonian Epoch of Cyrus, according to the Calculation of the
Profane Historians, the Product will show the year of the Julian Period. And
if the said 4175 years be subtracted from the known year of the Julian Period,
the Residue will show the year since the Beginning of this Epoch.

. 1. THere are some who don't allow of any Whether the Babylonian and Persian
Epoch of Cyrus be the same
difference betwixt the Persian and Babylonian Epoch of Cyrus; but maintain,
that in one and the same year he made himself Master of Persia, Media, Assyria
and Babylon; which being repugnant to all the best Monuments of Antiquity, it
is a Wonder to me how some among the Learned could be misguided into this
Opinion.

. 2. There are some who affirm that Balthazar Whether Balthazar was the last
King of Babylon.
was the last King of Babylon, who was vanquished by Cyrus in Conjunction with
Darius the King of the Medes; being misguided by the Authority of Lib. 10. c.
12. Ant.
Josepus, whose Words are as follows: Abilamerodach died in the 18th year of
his Reign, and was succeeded by his Son Niglisar, who reigned 40 years. After
his Death succeeded his Son Labosordach, who dying about 9 Months after, the
Kingdom was devolved to Balthazar, whom the Babylonians call Naboandel. He was
engaged in a bloody War against Cyrus King of Persia, and Darius King of Media;
and whilst he was besieged in Babylon, was surprised by a most prodigious
Vision; and not long after both Balthazar and the City fell into the Hands of
Cyrus King of Persia, who took Babylon in the 17th year of the Reign of
Balthazar, etc. But Josephus is mistaken in this Relation, as may appear out of
the Fragments of the true Berosus inserted by Lib. 1. contra App.
Josephus himself: For Labosordach mentioned by Josephus, is the same with
Balthazar: Neither happened the Conquest of Cyrus under his Reign: Neither did
Darius the Median conquer the Kingdom of Babylon; But, according to Berosus and
Megasthenes, was declared King of the Babylonian Empire.

. 3. It is also called in Question by some whether Darius the Median mentioned
in the Scripture, Whether Darius Medus is the same with Nabonnidus,
is the same with Nabonnidus, mentioned by Herodotus and other Historians;
because that Nabonnidus is called by Berosus, the Babylonian; but Darius is
surnamed in the Scripture the Median: But since Darius is mentioned in the
Scripture as the immediate Successor of Belsazar (who in profane History is
called Labosoradach) and that the other Historians have made Nabonnidus (or
Laponytus as Herodotus calls him) it seems more than probable that these two
Names belong to one and the same Person, especially since Megasthenes says of
the Babylonians. They declared Nabonnichus a Foreigner their King.

. 4. Henricus Buntingus, with some others, Of the Opinion of Xenophon
concerning Darius Medus.
relying upon the Authority of Xenophon, would make this Darius Medus the same
with Cyaxares, mentioned in profane History. But concerning the Authority of
Xenophon we have spoke sufficiently before.

. 5. There are also many learned Authors, who being misled by Josephus, would
have this Darius Medus was not the Son of Astyages.
Darius to have been the Son and Successor of Astyages, and Uncle to Cyrus. But
though Darius was originally of Media, D^n. 9. ver. 1.
yet he is not called King of Media, but of Chaldaea; And Justin sufficiently
contradicts this Opinion, when he says, Astyages had no Male Issue.

. 6. According to Berosus, whose Fragments are inserted by Josephus, Cyrus,
after he had vanquished Of the Conquest of Babylon.
Darius, besieged the City of Babylon; which being well provided with
Provisions sufficient to sustain a long Siege, the Inhabitants bid Defiance to
the Persians, who at last having found means to drain the River of Euphrates,
(which runs through the City) by diverting its Course into the adjacent
Marshes, surprised the City. Herodotus relates, that the Persians, the better
to put their Design in Execution, had pitched upon a Day, which being one of
the Festivals among the Babylonians, they were bufied in Dancing and other
Jollities. The Prophet Cap. 44 v. 27.
Isaiah seems to have foretold this Derivation of the River of Euphrates, when
he says of Cyrus, That says to the Deep, be dry; and I will dry up thy Rivers:
as the Conquest of Babylon, in the Absence of their King, was foretold by C.
51. v. 31.
Jeremiah: One Post shall run to meet another, and one Messenger to meet
another, to show the King of Babylon that his City is taken at one End; and
that the Passages are stop^, and the Reeds they have burnt with Fire, and the
Men of War are affrighted, etc.

. 7. There is also a Contest among the Chronologers Whether Cyrus conquered
Babylon before Croesus.
whether Cyrus conquered the Babylonian Empire after he had vanquished Croesus,
or before. Justin relates, that Croesus assisted the Babylonians against Cyrus;
who, after the Conquest of Babylon, marched into Lydia against Croesus, who was
vanquished and taken Prisoner by him. But Herodotus says expressly that Cyrus
vanquished Croesus before the Conquest of Babylon; and Eusebius Chronic.
and Julius Solinus Cap. 7. agree in Opinion, that the Conquest of Lydia happened
in the first year of the 58th Olympiad. C. 25. v. 26.
Jeremiah seems to favor the last; when after he had mentioned all the other
Kings before, he says thus of the King of Babylon; And the King of Sheshach
shall drink after them.

. 8. Some of the Chronologers make the first Of the first year of Cores
ment^on'd in the Scriptures.
year of the Babylonian Epoch of Cyrus coincident with the same year which is
in the Scriptures called the First Year of Cores. They allege in their behalf,
that to reckon backwards from the fourth year of King Jehoiachim (when
according to the Opinion of some, the Flower of the Jewish Nation was carried
into Captivity by Nebuchadnezzar) to the first year of the Babylonian Epoch of
Cyrus, compleats exactly the time of 70 years; and that the Conquest of Babylon
by Cyrus, and his Deliverance of the Jews out of their Captivity, is agreeable
to the Prophecy of C. 25. v. 12.
Jeremiah; And it shall come to pass when 70 years are accomplished, that I
will punish the King of Babylon and that Nation, says the Lord, for their
Iniquity, and the Land of the Chaldaeans; and will make it perpetual
Desolations. But I must needs give the Preference to the Opinion of Scaliger,
who makes a difference betwixt these two Aera's. For it being evident out of C.
24. v. 1, 2. c. 33. v. 21. c. 40. v. 1.
Ezekiel and several other Passages alleged before of the Holy Scripture, that
the End of the 70 years Captivity mentioned under the first year of Cores, must
be accounted backwards to the time of Jehoiachim. This time is in no wise
agreeable to the Calculation of Berosus's and Ptolemy's Babylonian Epoch of
Cyrus. There is also another Objection to be made against this first year of
the Babylonian Epoch; to wit, that since, by the Consent of most Historians,
Cyrus reigned 9 years after, it is very probable that the Jews would not have
neglected in all this time to rebuild the Temple; especially, since it is
evident out of C. 2. v. 3.
Ezra, that Cyrus never recalled the said Edict. For which Reason it appears
more probable that the first year of Cores mentioned in the Scripture, was not
long before his Death, it being else very difficult to imagine how Cambyses the
Successor of Cyrus could have prevented the same Edict to be put in Execution.
And here it is very observable, that in profane History the year when Cyrus
entered the Babylonian Empire and vanquished Darius, is expressly mentioned; but
the Conquest of the City of Babylon, which in all Probability, t^anscend a
considerable time, is passed by in silence. From whence it is apparent, that
the Profane Historians fix the Beginning of the Babylonian Epoch of Cyrus to
that time when he vanquished Darius: But it seems as if the Holy Scripture
understood by the first year of Cores the same year when he made himself Master
of the Capital City of Babylon, as it is with the Era Actiaca; which some
begin from the Battle of Actium; others from the Conquest of Alexandria. There
is also another Observation to be made, That the Words in the Original Text do
not expressly denote the First Year of Cores; but rather One of the Years of
Cores; which, I wonder how it should slip the Observation of so many
Interpreters.

CHAP. XXV. Of the Epoch of the Banishment of the Roman Kings, and the
Establishment of the Consular Dignity.
The Characters of this Epo ha are 1. The Banishment of the Roman Kings, and
the Establishment of the Liberty of the People of Rome. 2. The Establishment of
the Consular Dignity in Rome. 3. The Interval of 244 years betwixt the Epoch
of the Building of the City of Rome and this Epoch, as may be gathered from
Livy, Messala, Corvinus, and several other Roman Historians. 4. The first
Consulate of L. Junius Brutus and L. Tarquinius Brutus, the last of which
enjoyed this Dignity but for a very little time, being obliged to abdicate
himself from the Consulate by reason of his Name and Affinity with the Royal
Family, and was succeeded by P. Valerius Poplicola. 5. The Kings were banished
Rome at the same time that those of Athens were delivered from the Tyranny of
the Pisistratides, according to Pliny, Lib. 34. c. 4. 6. The first Tarentin
Games, after the Banishment of the Roman Kings were instituted by Valerius
Poplicola, according to the Testimony of Valerius Antias in Censorinus, c. 17.
7. Pythagoras of Samus was in Italy at the same time when L. Brutus freed his
Native Country from the Tyranny of the Roman Kings Cic. Tusc. 4. 8. Soon after
the Banishment of the Roman Kings, the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was
dedicated by M. Horatius Pulvillus who was chosen Colleague to Poplicola after
the Death of Brutus who was slain in the Field, according to Histor. l. 3.
Tacitus and L 5. c. 1^.
Valerius Maximus. 9. The 6th Day of the Calends of March, Tarquin the last of
the Roman Kings was forced to leave the City, the Banishment of the Roman Kings
being by the ancient Roman Historians fixed to that day.


These and innumerable other Characters show the year of this Epoch to have
been coincident with the year 4206 of the Julian Period, Cycl.. 6.. 7. in the
Beginning of the Spring, which time we look upon as to be unquestionably in
reference to the Banishment of the Roman Kings.

If therefore from any certain year given of the Julian Period be subtracted
4205 years and 2 Months, the Any year given of the Julian Period to find out
the year since the beginning of this Epoch.
Residue shows the year since the Banishment of the Roman Kings; And if the
beforementioned Sum be added to the year of the said Epoch, the Product will
be correspondent to the year of the Julian Period.

. 1. THE ancient Historians make mention of these seven following Roman Kings:

Years. 1. Romulus, who reigned 37 A Vacancy of the Throne, which lasted 1 2.
Numa Pompilius, who reigned 43 3. Tullus Hostilius, who reigned 27 4. Ancus
Martius, who reigned 24 5. Tarquinius Priscus, who reigned 38 6. Servius
Tullius, who reigned 44 7. Tarquinius Superbus, who reigned 25 The Sum 244

. 2. The Occasion of the Banishment of the Roman Kings, and the Establishment
of the Consular Government mentioned by Livy, Florus, Aurelius Victor, and
other Roman Historians, is contracted by L. 2. de Fin.
Cicero in these following Words; Lucretia being ravished by the King's Son,
laid violent Hands upon her self. The Grief conceived at so extraordinary an
Action by the People of Rome, proved the real Cause of the Liberty of their
City under the Conduct of Brutus.

. 3. The Annual Government of the Roman Consuls being looked upon as so many
Characters of Time, by the Ancients, have been very industrious in ordering the
Catalogue of these Consuls; but they all are fallen short from what has been
done in this kind, since in the year 1547 the Public Records called Tabulae
Capitolins, were found at Rome, which (as it is supposed) were first collected
by Verrius Flaccus Grammaticus, by Command of the Senate, and afterward
published under the Reign of Augustus, Cuspinianus, Carolus Sigonius, and
Onuphrius Panvinius had the chief Management in restoring and ordering this
Catalogue; but notwithstanding all their Ingenuity and Industry, have not been
able to supply the Defect of four Pair of Consuls that were wanting in these
Records. I cannot but agree with Calvisius in this Point; who attributes this
Defect of these four Pair of Consuls, to the Irregularity of the Ancient Roman
Calendar.

CHAP. XXVI. Of the Epoch of the first War betwixt the Greeks and Persians, or
the time of the Battle fought near Marathon.
1. All the Ancient Authors who have made mention of this War, agree that the
Persians and Greeks were first engaged in War after the burning of the City of
Sardis, and the Banishment of the Pisistratides from Athens. 2. The Battle of
Marathon was, according to Thucydides, fought in the 20th year after the
Banishment of Hippias from Athens. 3. At which time Darius Hystaspes Father of
Xerxes reigned over Persia, whose Generals were Datis and Attaphernes, Son to
Attaphernes, Brother of Darius; and the Athenians had chosen Miltiades their
General; as may be seen in Herodotus, Plutarch, Justin, Cornelius Nepos, and a
great many others. 4. This Defeat of the Persians happened in the fifth or sixth
year before the Death of Darius: So that the Battle of Marathon was fought in
the 31st year of the Reign of Darius Hystaspes, according to Herodotus. 5. In
the same 31st year of Darius there happened a notable Eclipse of the Moon, which
Ptolemy observes to have been in the Night betwixt the third and fourth day of
the month Tybis, in the year of the Julian Period 4223, on the 25th of April,
the 4th Feria. 6. The Athenians obtained this signal Victory when Phanippus was
Archon (or Prince) of Athens, who was succeeded by Aristides, as may be seen in
In Vit. Arist.
Plutarch. After Phanippus (says he) under whose Government the Athenians
vanquished the Persians near Marathon, Aristides was constituted Archon. 7. At
the same time Macerinus and Augurinus were Consuls at Rome, according to
Sulpitius Severus. 8. The Battle of Marathon was fought in the 16th year after
the Death of Brutus, who freed his Native Country from the Kingly Government,
according to Dionysius Halicarnassaeus. 9. Of this Expedition L. 3. de Leg.
Plato, with whom agree Lib. 1.
Thucydides and Or^t. 31.
Lysias, has the following Words: About ten years before the Sea Fight near
Salamis, Datis came with the Persian Fleet into Graecia, by the Order of
Darius, who had expressly commanded him under pain of Death to conquer and carry
away Captives the Eretrians and Athenians. 10. The Athenians obtained this
Victory over the Persians toward the End of the 260th year after the Building
of the City of Rome, according to the Observations of Lib. 17. c. 21.
A. Gellius and Sulpitius Severus. 11. The Battle of Marathon was fought either
before, or just at the time of the Full Moon, as is evident out of what Lib. 6.
Herodotus has observed concerning the Lacedaemonians, who at the Request of
Phidippus, were to assist the Athenians. These are his Words: The
Lacedaemonians were not unwilling to assist the Athenians against the Persians:
but they were not at that time in a Condition to put it immediately in
Execution, being forbidden by their Laws; it and being the ninth Day of the
Month; on which day the Soldiers refused to march, as being just upon the Point
of the Full Moon. 12. In Camill.
Plutarch observes that the Battle of Marathon was fought on the 6th day of the
Month Boedromion, and inserts a whole Catalogue of Days of the Month
Boedromion, which proved fatal to the Persians. On the 6th day of the Month
Boedromion (says he) the Persians were defeated by the Greeks at Marathon, on
the 3d of the same Month near Plataeas, on the same day near Mychale, on the
26th at Arbelas. The Athenians vanquished the Persians at Sea near Naxus, under
the Command of Chabrias their General, near the Full Moon of the Month of
Boedromion, and near Salamis, on the 20th day of the same Month.
According to the several Observations and Testimonies of the Ancient
Historians concerning this Signal Victory, we agree with Scaliger, that this
Battle was fought in the year of the Julian Period 4223, Cycl.. 23.. 5. toward
Autumn, or about the time of the Full Moon in August, which happened in that
year, on the 21st day of the same Month, which Scaliger being misguided by the
Athenian Years, has fixed on the 5th day of October.

If therefore from any certain given year of the Julian Any certain year given
of the Julian Period to find out the year since the beginning of this Epoch.
Period be subtracted 4222 years and seven Months, the Residue shows the year
since the Victory obtained at Marathon: Unto which, if the abovementioned Sum
be added, the Product is correspondent to the year of the Julian Period.

. 1. THE War betwixt the Greeks and Persians The Occasion of the War betwixt
the Persians and Greeks.
was occasioned thus: The Ionians inhabiting the Seacoasts of Asia, had
rebelled against Darius; and being assisted by the Athenians, had burnt the
City of Sardis; which so incensed Darius, that he ordered one of those who
attended him at Supper, to repeat every day thrice these Words, MY LORD,
REMEMBER THE ATHENIANS. Another Cause was the Banishment of the Pisistratides
by the Athenians, who also grossly abused the Ambassadors sent by Darius.
Hippias, who was descended from the Family of the Pisistratides, and likewise
banished Athens, was not idle in improving these Opportunities to his
Advantage; and to stir up Darius against the Athenians, which at last turned to
his own Destruction, he being stain in the Battle of Marathon, as is evident
out of L. 2. c. 9.
Justin and Ad Attic. 9. Ep. 12.
Cicero.

. 2. Those who have left us the History of these Times affirm, that Darius sent
a Fleet of The vast Army of Darius.
600 Ships into Greece under the Command of Datis a Median by Birth, and
Artaphernes the Son of his Brother Artaphernes; who, together with Hippias and
an Army of 200000; or, as some will have it, 300000 Foot, and 10000 Horse,
invaded Greece, but with very ill Success. Of which Herodotus, Justin, Probus,
and others may be consulted.

. 3. The Athenians, who saw themselves Of the Bravery of the Athenians.
not in a Condition to oppose a proportionable Force to that of their Enemies;
yet did not lose Courage; but having gathered what Forces they could, both of
their own and amongst the Plataeans, who were the only People that assisted the
Athenians; they, with 10 or 11000 Men, courageously encountered the Persians;
which Heroic Action of the Athenians is very pathetically represented by Orat.
3^.
Lysias the Athenian, and one of the ten Orators of Greece: Neither ought it to
be passed by in Silence what is observed by Dissert. 14.
Maximus Tyrius; to wit, that the Athenian Forces were for the most part
composed of Country Fellows, who, at the News of the Enemies landing at
Marathon, flocked in from the adjacent Countries to defend their Native Country
against so powerful an Invasion.

. 4. Sethus Calvisius is of Opinion that Plutarch Whether the Battle of
Marathon was fought ^^ the 6th day of the Month Boedromion.
was mistaken in his Relation, when he says that the Battle of Marathon was
fought on the sixth day of the Month Boedromion: because, says he, this Battle
happened just at the N. Moon, but in the Athenian Years the F. Moon could not
happen on the sixth day of the Month Boedromion. But this Objection being
founded upon the Supposition of Scaliger concerning the Athenian Years, which
has not met with an entire Approbation from those who are the most skilful in
the Grecian Antiquities; we cannot agree in this Point with Scaliger's
Opinion, who assigns the Month of October for the Battle of Marathon. But it
seems very improbable, that the Persians not used to the Rigor of the Winter
Season, should have chosen the Month of October for so great an Expedition,
before the Month of Boedromion, which is accounted among the Summer Months by
the Athenians.

CHAP. XXVII. Of the Expedition or Descent of Xerxes into Greece, and the
Epoch of the Battle of Salamis.
1. Xerxes the Son of Darius, to revenge the Disgrace received by his Father at
Marathon, resolved to prosecute the War begun in his Father's time against
Greece: For which purpose after vast Preparations made for five years together,
he began his Expedition against Greece in the sixth year, according to Lib. 2.
c. 10.
Justin. 2. Xerxes, after he had conquered Egypt, of which he had made his
Brother Achamenes Governor, invaded Greece at the Instigation of Mardonius,
according to Lib. 7.
Horodotus. 3. This Descent was made on the same year that Calliades was Archon
at Athens, according to Herodotus, Dionysius Halicarnassaeus, and Diodorus
Siculus. 4. It was made in the same year that the 75th Olympiad was celebrated
among the Eleans, where Assylus of Syracusa won the Race, according to Diodorus
Siculus. 5. It happened in the year 297. after the first Olympiad, according to
the Testimony of Eratosthenes in Clemens Alexandrinus. 6. Besides, that total
Eclipse of the Sun which happened in the same year that Xerxes began his
Expedition against Greece, Herod. L. 7.
and was observed by the Persians in the Spring, as they were ready to break up
from Sardis: There happened also another Eclipse of the Sun, which being observed
by Cleombrotus as he was performing his Sacrifice, he returned with those
Forces that were sent to post themselves in the Isthmus ^^ Sparta Her. Lib. 9.
7. The Battle of Salamis was fought ten years after that of Marathon,
according to Plato, Thucydides, and Lysias. 8. The Defeat of the Persians near
Salamis happened in the same year that Caesus Fabius and Sp. F^sius Furus were
Consuls at Rome, according to Dionysius Halicarnassaeus Lib. 9.
9. The Battle of Salamis was fought about the time that the Greeks solemnized
their Feast called Mysteria; as may be gathered from Lib. 8.
Herodotus. 10. The Day on which this Battle was fought* was the 20th day of
the Month of Boedromion, as has been observed by Plutarch, cited in the
foregoing Chapter.
From whence may be concluded, that the Battle of Salamis happened in the year of
the Julian Period 4234. Cycl. 6.. 16. in Autumn; and that Xerxes ^^de his
Descent in the Spring.

If therefore from any (...) given of the Julian To investigate the Tear since
the beginning of this Epoch.
Period be subtracted* 4233 years and eight Months, the Residue sh^ws the year
since the beginning of this Epoch: And if the said Sum be added to the year of
this Epoch, (...) Product will be correspondent to the year of the Julian
Period.

. 1. THE Historians differ in their Relations Of the vast Number of the Forces
transported by Xerxes into Greece.
concerning the Number of Forces which Xerxes transported into Greece; yet so,
that according to the most modest Computation they allow them to have been
700000 at least; whereas the most make them amount to an almost incredible
Number. For Herodotus says the Persian Army consisted of 2310007 Foot and 80000
Horse, not comprehending the Servants and others that followed the Army. Justin
says, Xerxes had brought together an Army of 700000 Men out of Persia, besides
300000 Auxiliaries; so that it was not without Reason said from his Army, that
they consumed and dreined whole Rivers, and that all Greece was not big enough
to contain them. Vit. Themist.
Probus makes his Army to consist of 700000 Foot and 40000 Horse; and Or^t. 3^.
Lysias represents the Number of the Persians transported into Greece by Xerxes
as incredible. This Expedition therefore having been of such an extraordinary
Moment, and the Defeat of so vast an Army proportionable to the Greatness of
the Enterprise, what wonder if this was looked upon as one of the most
memorable Epocha's in the ancient times. The most memorable Engagements betwixt
the Persians and Greeks.


. 2* The first Engagement after the Descent made by Xerxes in Greece, betwixt
the Greeks and Persians, happened at Thermopylae, where Leonidas the Sp^c^^n
General and King did encounter the whole Force of Asia; and notwithstanding he
was foretold by the Oracle that he should lose the Day, he animated his
Soldiers in the following Words: Let us, Fellow Soldiers, dine as if we were to
sup together in the other World. Leonidas was slain in the Engagement by the
Persidy of the Inhabitants of the Place, who had betrayed the Avenues and
Passages to the Enemy; but the Persians did not purchase this Victory without
the Loss of 20000 Men on their side. The Tombs of the Lacedaemonians were
adorned with the following Epigram of Simonides, as it is to be found in Latin
in I. 9.
Cicero.

Dic, hospes, Spartae, nos te hic vidisse jacentes,
Dum sanctis patriae legibus obsequimur.
The next Encounter happened near Artemisium, where both Parties having fought
with almost equal Fortune, the Greeks, under Conduct of Themistocles, drew the
Persians into the Streights of Salamis, where they were entirely routed.
Notwithstanding which, the Greeks and Persians came to another Engagement in
the next following year near Plateae, a City of Boeotia, where Mardonius at the
Head of an Army of 200000 Foot and 20000 Horse, was slain in the Field, with a
great Number of Persians, as may be seen more at large in (l) Herodotus, in L.
11. c. l. 9.
Diodorus Siculus, in In Lacon.
Strabo and Pausanias. On the same day happened that memorable Sea Fight betwixt
the Greeks and Persians near Mycale, wherein the first were likewise
victorious; after which the Persians were so far from being able to recover
their Loss, that they were forced in their Camp; and afterward Xerxes and his
Successors lost all the strong Holds they were possessed of in those Parts.

. 3. After which unfortunate Battle of Salamis, The Flight of Xerxes.
Xerxes sought his own Safety in a most ignominious Flight, leaving so vast an
Army without a Head: And he, who had covered the Sea not long before with his
Fleet, now satisfied himself with a small Fisher-Boat; which, after it had been
for some time tossed up and down by the tempestuous Weather, at last conveyed
him to the Asiatick Shore; where being despised by his Subjects, he was
unfortunately murdered by Arbanus. (i) Tusc. quaest. L. 1.


. 4. Scaliger is of Opinion that this Xerxes, Whether Xerxes is the same with
Ahasuerus.
who by his unfortunate Expedition into Greece, has given the Name to this
Epoch, was the same with Ahasuerus, who is mentioned to have espoused Esther
in the Holy Scripture. It must be confessed that some Objections may be made
against this Assertion: But thus much is certain on the other hand, that it is
not destitute of a great Probability: For, not to insist upon the Affinity of
the Word Oxyares (which was the Name of Xerxes before he came to the Crown) the
great Character given of the Power of Ahasuerus is most suitable to Xerxes. For
though the Persian Monarchs, both before and after the Reign of Xerxes, were
Masters of many great Provinces, yet there is scarce any of them since Xerxes,
who could boast that the Limits of his Empire extended from the Indies to
Aethiopia; and that none of the Predecessors of Xerxes could pretend to that
Glory, seems to be manifest out of the Oration of Mardonius the General of
Xerxes; whose Words spoken to the Soldiery are thus related by Herodotus: It
would be very unbecoming to us, who have conquered the Saca's, Indians,
Aethiopians and Assyrians, out of no other Motive than the Desire of extending
our Conquests, should let the Greeks, who have been the first Aggressors, go
off unrevenged. And if we inspect the Catalogue of the Persian Kings as
mentioned by Esdra, and how congruous it is to our Opinion, I cannot but wonder
how the same should have been so little regarded by those, who elsewhere appear
so zealous in maintaining their Opinions out of the Scripture against the
Chronologers. Those who would have Ahasuerus to be the same with Artaxerxes
Longimanus, are very well censured by Christianus Adamus Ruperti: Such, says
he, as make Artaxerxes Longimanus the Spouse of Esther, have not rightly
compared the Holy Scripture with the ancient Monuments of Profane History.
Unless we be, (concludes he) quite unacquainted with the Book of Esther and
Esdra, we must confess that Ahasuerus was the same with Xerxes: For he is
expressly put before Artaxerxes I. and Darius Nothus.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of the Epoch of the Peloponnesian WAR.
1. Thucydides Lib. 2.
in his Commentary of this most famous War, lays down the Characters of this
Epoch; among which are two Eclipses of the Sun and one of the Moon: The first
Eclipse of the Sun he makes coincident with the Summer of the same year when
the Peloponnesian War began. Plutarch In vit. Pericl
and Valerius Maximus make likewise mention of this Eclipse. 2. The 2 d Eclipse
of the Sun Thucydides L. 4.
makes coincident with the beginning of the 8th year of the Peloponnesian War.
3. The 3 d Eclipse being in the Moon, Thucidides L. 2.
makes coincident with the 19th year of the Peloponnesian War L. 2.
. 4* According to the Testimony of the same Author, the Peloponnesian War began
in the same year that Pythodorus was Archon at Athens, and Aenesias Ephorus of
Sparta; yet so, that the first, after two Months from the Beginning of this War
was succeeded by Euthydemus, as the last was by Brasidas: So that the greatest
part of their annual Government being coincident with the first year of this
Epoch, its Origin is commonly deduced from the time of the Magistracy of these
two last. 5. The first year of the 86th Olympiad when Lysimachus was Archon at
Athens, and Isocrates was born, was the fifth year before the Peloponnesian
War, according to Dionysius, Plutarch, and Laertius. 6. The 18th year of the
Peloponnesian War was coincident with the same Olympiad when Crocinus of
Thessalia won the Race; and when Eudius or Eudicus was Ephorus at Sparta, and
Pythodorus Archon at Athens: And in the same year happened the Eclipse of the
Sun, which, by the Astronomical Calculation has been found to have been in the
year of the Julian Period 4310, on the third Day of September, according to L.
2 Rer. Graec.
Xenophon. 7. The Peloponnesian War began with the Spring according to
Thucydides, L. 2.
From these and other Characters too many to be inserted here, we conclude that
the Peloponnesian War began in the year of the Julian Period 4283, in the
Spring, Cycle. 27.. 8.

If therefore from any certain year of the Julian To find out the year since
the Beginning of this Epoch.
Period be subtracted 4282 years and 3 months, the Residue shows the year since
the beginning of the Peloponnesian War: And if the same Sum be added to the
said year of this Epoch, the Product must be correspondent to the year of the
Julian Period.

. 1. IT is very well worth Observation what The Occasion of the Peloponnesian
War.
Bibl. l. 12.
Diodorus Siculus and L. 3. c. 3.
Valerius Maximus relate concerning the Occasion of this War. For Pericles a
Man of great Authority among the Athenians, having converted a vast Sum of
Money which was given by the Athenians to rebuild the Castle of Athens, to his
own Use, and finding himself not in a Capacity to give an Account of it to his
Fellow-Citizens, appeared one day very melancholy at home. Alcibiades being
then but a Youth, perceiving him to be more than ordinary pensive, asked him
what made him look so much concerned? Unto which Pericles answering, because he
did not know how to make up his Accounts. Alcibiades replied, then you have
nothing else to do, but to find out a way not to be accountable at all.
Pericles taking the Hint, from that day found Means to persuade the Athenians
to begin this War, imagining that thereby they would be prevented from calling
him to an Account.

. 2. And though this War be commonly called the Who were concerned on both sides
in this War.
Peloponnesian War, yet were not the Peloponnesians and Athenians alone
concerned in it, but all Greece. On the side of the Peloponnesians were the
Lacedaemonians, whose General was Archidamus, the Megarians, Locrians,
Phocenses, Ambrecioti, Lucadians, the Boeotians, Corinthians, and Syconians.
The Athenians had for their Confederates the Chii, Lesbii, the Plataeenses,
Messenii, Caria, Acarnanes, Corcyrei, Jacynthii, Cyclades, besides those of
Ionia, Hellespont and Thracia, who were Tributaries to the Athenians. See
Pausanias In Lacon.
How long the Peloponnesian War^asted.
.

. 3. Ad Reb. Graec.
Xenophon allots 28 years and 6 months for the Peloponnesian War; but Dionysius
Petavius has very well observed that Xenophon has made an Addition of one year,
there being no more than 27 years and 6 months to be accounted from the Spring
of the 4283d year of the Julian Period when this War begun, till the Autumn of
the 4310th year of the Julian Period when it was ended, and was rendered
remarkable by a notable Eclipse of the Suns: both the Beginning and the End of
this War, being illustrious by two Eclipses of the same. In the 10th year of
this War the Greeks, as Thucydides relates, made a Truce which was very ill
observed.

. 4. The annual Magistracy of the Archontes The Names of the Athenian
Archontes, and Lacedemonian Ephori during this War.
at Athens, and of the Lacedaemonian Ephori, having both their Beginning about
the time of the Aestival Solstice, and the Names of the several Archontes and
Ephori being looked upon as so many Characters in the History of this War, we
have for the more Perspicuity's sake, inserted their Names in the following
Catalogue, each in his due Order, with an Addition of each year of the Julian

CHAP. XXIX. Of the Epoch and Interval of the Seventy Weeks of Daniel
mentioned in the 9th Chapter, Verse 24.
1. By these 70 Weeks are to be understood annual Weeks, or an Interval of 490
years. 2. During this Interval of Years the Messiah was born, and suffered
Death, Verse. 24. 3. The beginning of this Epoch is to be fixed to that time
when that solemn Edict of rebuilding the City of Jerusalem was made. 4. The End
of these 70 annual Weeks ought to be coincident with the time of the total
Destruction of that City, according to the Words in C. 9. v.
Daniel, Seventy Weeks are determined upon thy People, and upon thy holy City;
and the Words of C. 24. v. 15.
St. Matthew, When you shall see the Abomination of Desolation stand in the
holy Place. 5. From the beginning of this Interval or Epoch, till the 32 d
year of the Reign of Artaxerxes Mnemon, when Nehemiah returned ^^t of Persia,
ought to be accounted 7 annual Weeks ^^ 49 Nehem. 13. v. 6.
Years, Dan. 9. v. 25. 6. Scaliger 's Opinion seems to be not impro^^bl^* that
the first year of these 70 Annual ^^eks was likewise the first both in the
Sacred, Sabb^tic, and Jubilean Cycle: For the Angel calls the^ expressly Annual
Weeks, which are equivalent ^^ the Sabbatick Cycle, and all together make (...)
Interval of 490 Years, or 10 Jubilean Cycle* And what has been said of the
first year of the mystical Interval, may likewise be applied to (...) last

From whence Scaliger and his Followers concl^^^ that the first year of the 70
Weeks of Daniel (...) coincident with the 4292 d year of the Juli^^ Period; and
that the last year was coinci^^^^ with the 4782 d year of the same Julian

Nothus, and end with the Destruction of Jerusalem. All which we leave to the
Determination of the Reader. But among all others, the Hypothesis of Reinoldus
puts the Determination of this Prophecy beyond all Possibility, when, the
better to palliate his erroneous Opinion, that these 490 years ought to begin
from Cyrus and end with the Messiah, he insinuates, that by these LXX Weeks
there was not intended any certain determined time: but in a sense usual in the
Scripture, a certain Number was set for an uncertain. It is undeniable that the
Calculation founded upon this Prophecy concerning the 70 Weeks, is involved in
no small Difficulties; nevertheless, not such as are impossible to be
surmounted. For else it had been spoken in vain by the Angel, KNOW THEREFORE
AND UNDERSTAND, if it had been beyond all possibility of being comprehended by
Mortal Men: And what Benefit could be supposed to accrue to Mankind from such
Words as were altogether incomprehensible by Human Understanding. As it is
beyond all Dispute, that the Event renders Prophecies more perspicuous; so it
is in this case, that since the time prefixed by the Angel is expired long ago,
the Event it self has in a great measure illustrated the Words of this
Prophecy; so that we need not despair of its Interpretation. And since it is
evident, that the Angel expressly mentions both the Beginning and End of these
70 Weeks, the Hypothesis of Reinoldus ought to be rejected, as directly
opposite to the Words of the Holy Scripture.

. 2. Among the Christian Interpreters, Hom* 29. in Matthew.
Concerning the Interval of 7 Weeks mentioned by the Angel.
Origin understands by each of the Angelical Weeks seven times ten Years: So
that the whole Number of these 70 Weeks makes up 4900 years. He fixes their
beginning to the Creation of Adam, and their end to the Destruction of the
second Temple. There are also some among the Jews who interpret these 70 Weeks
of so many Jubilean Cycles, and conse^uently make up their whole Number 3430
years. But both these Opinions are so absurd and founded upon Suppositions
contrary to the Phrase of the Scripture and the Nature of this Interval, that
there are but very few who have espoused either of these Opinions: For two
sorts of Weeks are only mentioned in the Scripture: The first is the Week
consisting of seven Days; on the last of which, to wit, the seventh Feria, the
Jews were commanded to rest from their ordinary Employments in memory of the
seventh day when God rested after the Creation of the Universe. And besides
these Weeks consisting of 7 Days, we also find in the holy Scripture Annual
Weeks, each of which are equivalent to 7 years. Of these Moses makes mention in
Cap. 25. ver. 8.
Levitieus; And thou shall number seven Sabbaths of years unto thee, seventy
times seven years, and the space of the seven Sabbaths of years shall be unto
thee forty and nine years. It is no very difficult Matter to determine which of
these two sorts of Weeks is to be understood in this Prophecy; it being
evident, that since the Prediction of the Angel was made in respect of a thing
that was to happen not till a considerable time after, these 70 Weeks, could
not be understood of the Common Ones, but of Annual Weeks* For it is said, that
in the Space of 7 Weeks the City was to be rebuilt; which certainly could not
be done in 49 Days or 7 Weeks time. And the Event it self (the best Interpreter
of Prophecies) has convinced us, that the Edict of rebuilding the City, the
Appearing of the Messiah, and the total Destruction of the City did not happen
till 490 years after, which was the exact time of 70 Weeks foretold by the
Angel. From whence it plainly appears that the Weeks mentioned in Daniel were
Annual Weeks, each of which contained the Space of 7 Years and the whole
Interval of 70 Weeks 490 Years. Most of the Jewish Interpreters themselves are
forced to agree in this Point with us, that the Angel intended by these 70
Weeks 490 Years; though they differ from us, both in the Beginning and End of
this Interval. Term. vit. hum. p. ^68.
Menasseh Ben Israel says ex-expresly, The 70 Weeks of Daniel make up 490
Years. And to the same Purpose Comment. in Dan.
Rab. Isaac Abarbinel expresses himself, as also Rabbi Joseph Jacchias, and
Rabbi Aben Ezra, and many more.

. 3. Julius Africanus who is supposed to have Whether these 490 years consisted
of Lunar Years.
been the first among the Christians that traced the Chronology of the holy
Scripture. Eusebius (according to the Opinion of Scaliger and Gerhardus
Johannes Vossius) having transcribed out of his Works entire Pages in his
Chronology. This Africanus and after him Theodoretus, with several others, are
of Opinion that these 490 years are to be understood of Lunar Years, which make
475 Solar Years. Dionysius Carthusianus, who (according to Rob. Bellarminus
flourished about the year of Christ 1450) affirms that this Opinion was
received in the Scholastic History, and by those Doctors of the Church that
profess themselves Followers of Beda. But these Interpreters have been
misguided by the Word (...) which, not only in the vulgar Translation, but also
in the time of Tertullian, has been translated are abbreviated: For Tertullian
in his Book written against the Jews in the Chapter of the Passion of Christ
and the Destruction of Jerusalem, cites the Words of the Angel in the following
manner: Seventy Weeks are abbreviated upon thy People, and upon thy Holy City,
to finish the Transgression and to make an End of Sins, and to make
Reconciliation for Iniquities, and to bring in everlasting Righteousness; Which
has misguided these Interpreters into this Error, That not the common Years,
but such as are shorter than the rest, ought to be understood in this
Prediction: In which Sense Carthusianus says: These Weeks are said to be
shortened, not so as to be lessened in their Number, but in Quantity; because
the Lunar Year falls 11 Days shorter than the Solar Year. But these
Interpreters have missed the true Meaning of the Original Text, which does not
imply so much a Shortening, Lessening or Abbreviating, as the Determination of
certain exact Intervals of time. So that it remains unquestionable that the
Angel in this Prophecy did speak of the Solar Years, and at the same time
exactly determined the Beginning and the End of this Interval. See Corn. a
Lapide upon this Passage.

. 4. That the Beginning of this Interval Whether the beginning of this Interval
is to be fixed to the time of that solemn Edict of rebuilding the City.
ought to be fixed to the time of that solemn Edict of rebuilding the holy
City, appears most evidently from the Words of the Angel in Cap. 9. v. 25.
Daniel, Know therefore and understand, that from the publishing of the
Commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem, etc. according to the
Translation of Junius and Tremellius; or, from the going forth of the
Commandment, as Pagninus and Luther have translated it. And that thereby was
intended the rebuilding of a City, which was formerly destroyed, is evident
from the Words and the whole Scope of the Prophetic Text, the Angel having
spoken these Words as God's Answer to the Prayers of Daniel, which were as
follows: Now therefore, O our God, hear the Prayer of thy Servant, and his
Supplications, and cause thy Face to shine upon thy Sanctuary, that is desolate
for the Lord's sake. I cannot therefore but be surprised to see some of the
Fathers look for the Beginning of this Interval any where else than where is is
fixed by the Angel; especially what could move Origin to go back as far as
Adam; and, as we have said before, to make the Number of these Weeks amount to
4900 years. Thus Lib. contra Jud.
Tertullian, with several others of the Ancients, and among the modern Writers
Raymondus and Andreas Helvicus would deduce its Origin, not from the time of
this solemn Edict or Commandment, but from that time when God foretold the
rebuilding of the Temple and City by the Prophet. But the Jews make themselves
most ridiculous in that, to invalidate the Arguments of the Christians, by
which they prove from this Prophecy, that the Messiah is already come, they
pretend to put this fictitious Computation upon the World, that the Weeks of
Daniel ought to begin with the Destruction of the first* and end with the
Destruction of the second Temple: so that the 70 years of their Captivity,
during which time the Temple remained desolate, is to be added to 410 years*
which, they say, is the time the 2d Temple has stood; as may be seen in their
Chron. Major. in Rabbi Isaac Abarbinel, Rabbi Isaac Ben Abraham, and others of
the same Stamp. This Opinion is contradictory to the express Words of the
Angel; That from the going forth of the Commandment to restore the City, these
70 Weeks are to be computed. Besides that, it is (l)Cap. 9. v. 17.
absolutely false that there is an Interval of 490 years betwixt the
Destruction of the first and the second Temple. For, as has been sufficiently
demonstrated before (n), the Destruction of the first Temple happened in the Year
of the Julian Period 4124; whereas the second Temple was laid in Ashes in the
Year of the Julian Period 4783; so that the whole Interval amounts to no less
than 659 years. It is also quite beyond the Purpose, when the Jews pretend to
explain the Words of the Angel concerning the Messiah, of King Cyrus: For though
we read in C. 45. v. 1.
Isaiah, Thus said the Lord to his Anointed, to Cyrus, no Infetence is to be
made from thence, that the Word Messiah, either by it self, or with such
Attributes as occur in this Passage of Daniel, are ever applied in the
Scripture to any Earthly Prince. See D. Mulleri Judaism c. 10. and Constantini
L'Empereur, Annotat. ad Jachi^d.

. 5. We read of four several Edicts concerning Four several Edicts concerning
the Rebuilding of the City occur in the Scripture.
the Restoration of the Jews and the Rebuilding of the Temple and City in the
Holy Scripture. The first we meet with, is in C. 1. v. 1.
Ezra. In the first Year of Cyrus King of Persia (that the Word of the Lord by
the Mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled) the Lord stirred up the Spirit of
Cyrus King of Persia, that he made a Proclamation throughout all his Kingdom,
and put it also in Writing; saying, Thus said Cyrus King of Persia, The Lord
God of Heaven has given me all the Kingdoms of the Earth, and he has charged
me to build him an House at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among
you of all his People? His God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem
which is in Judah, and build the House of the Lord God of Israel, (he is the
God which (m) Chapter 22.
is in Jerusalem, etc. The same Words we read also in the C. 6. ^. ^2. 2^.
Chronicles, pursuant to the Prophecy of C. ^^.
Isaiah. The second Mandate or Edict concerning this Restitution is described
likewise by C* 6. v. ^^. 11. 12.
Ezra, which being sent by Darius in the same year that the Prophets Haggai and
Zechariah began to prophecy to the Governors beyond the River, contains the
following Words: Let the Work of this House of God alone: Let the Governor of
the Jews, and the Elders of the Jews build this House of God in his Place. etc.
Also, I have made a Decree, that whosoever shall alter this Word, let Timber be
pulled down from his House, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon, and
let his House be made a Dunghill for this; And the God that has caused his Name
to dwell there, destroy all Kings and People that shall put to their Hand to
alter and to destroy this House of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have
made a Decree; let it be done with speed. And the Prophecies of H^ggai and
Zachariah cited by Ezra, mention expressly the second Year of Darius, and the
Month. for thus we read in Haggai, Chap. 1. v. 1. and seq. In the second Year
of Darius the King, in the sixth Month, in the first Day of the Month, ^^me the
Word of the Lord by Haggai the Prophet unto Zetubbabel the Son of Shealtiel,
Governor of Judah, and to Joshua the Son of Josedech the High Priest, saying,
thus says the Lord of Hosts, etc. Go up to the Mountain and bring Wood, and
build the House, and I will take Pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, said
the Lord, The same Mandate is repeated by C. 1. v 1.
Z^chariah in the eighth Month of the same second Year of Darius; when,
pursuant to God's Commandment, and the Decree of the Persian King, the Work was
happily brought to Perfection, according to the Words of Ezra C. ^. v. 15, 16.
. And this House was finished on the third Day of the Month Adar, which was in
the sixth year of the Reign of Darius the King: And the Children of Israel, the
Priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the Children of the Captivity, kept
the Dedication of this House with Joy. The third Edict is likewise described by
C. 7. v. ^. s^q^.
Ezra. This Ezra went up from Babylon; and the King granted him all his
Request, according to the Hand of the Lord his God upon him. And there went up
some of the Children of Israel, and of the Priests, and the Levites, and the
Singers, and the Porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem in the 7th year of
Artaxerxes the King. And he came to Jerusalem in the 5th Month, which was in
the 7th Year of the King. This Decree of King Artaxerxes gran^s full Liberty to
the Jews to return to Jerusalem, and exempts all the Priests, Levites and other
Ministers of the House of God from Toll, Tribute or Custom. The fourth Edict
concerned particularly Nehemiah Ezr. ^. v. 13. 24.
, who in the 20th year of King Artaxerxes got leave to go to Jerusalem with the
King's Letter to the Governors beyond the River, and unto Asaph the Keeper of
the King's Forests, that he should give the Jews Timber to make Beams for the
Gates ^f the Palace, which appe^t^ineth to the House, and for the Wall of the
City, and for the House he was to enter into, as may be seen more at large in
Nehemiah, Chap. 2. from the 1st to the 9th Verse. And these are the four
several Mandates concerning the Restoration of the Jews, and the Rebuilding of
the Temple and City; unto one of which, the Beginning of these 70 Weeks m^st be
fixed. For the better understanding of the different Opinions of the
Chronologers concerning the Time and Reigns of these Kings, unto whom the said
Mandates are ascribed, we have given you in the following Table a Catalogue of
the Persian Kings, according to the Computation of Ptolemy, the Manuscript of
which was first found at London in England; and from thence sent over into
Germany by Mr. Overall. We have added the years of the Julian Period, and all
those Passages in the holy Scripture, where mention is made (according to our
Opinion) of these Kings:

. 6. There are not a few both among the Ancient Whether the Beginning of this
Epoch ought to be fixed to the time of the Solution of the Babylonian
Captivity.
and Modern ^nterpreters, who would have this Epoch of the 70 Weeks begin from
the time of the Edict of Cyrus, of which mention is made by C 1. v. 1. sequ.
Ezra, and in the 2 Chr. c. 3^. v. 23.
Chronicles. Among the Ancients, Clement of Alexandria patronizes this Opinion
before all others; and of the Modern Authors, David Paraeus, Constantine
L'Empereur, and Chr Sacr. p. 183.
Johannes Wichmannus, especially Chr. l. 3. c. 7.
Matthaeus Beroaldus and Beroaldus Broughton an Englishman; unto which Opinion
also the Dutch Interpreters seem to incline, as appears out of their Original
Annotations heretofore mentioned, but without any Probability of Truth. For
first, the Prophecy mentions such a Decree as was to be put in Execution* from
the very beginning of these 70 Weeks; And it is evident that the Mandate of
Cyrus did not take immediately the intended Effect, as may be seen in C. 4. v
4. 5.
Ezra, when he says, The People of the Land weakened the Hands of the People of
Judah, and troubled them in building, and hired Councillors against them to
frustrate their Purpose all the Days of Cyrus King of Persia, even unto the
Reign of Danius, King of Persia. It was 2dly, foretold by the Angel, that the
Streets and the Walls of the City were to be built again in the space of the 7
first Weeks, which, it is evident, was not accomplished in 49 years after the
Edict of Cyrus; for the we should allow never so many years to the Reign of
Cyrus after the Solution of the Babylonian Captivity, it will nevertheless be
impossible to make the Time when Nehemiah finished the Walls in the 32d year of
the Reign of Artaxerxes fall within the Compass of seven Annual Weeks, or 49
Years. See Nehemiah c. 13. v. 6. 3dly, The whole Structure of Beroaldus's
Artificial Hypothesis is built upon a very weak Foundation; to wit, that the
End of these 70 Weeks is to be completed with the Death of Christ, contrary to
the Intention of the Angel; when he says of this Interval, Seventy Weeks are
determined upon thy People, and upon thy Holy City. 4thly, Unless we will
positively contradict all the Persian, Greek and Roman Annals, it is impossible
to reduce the Interval from Cyrus till the Passion of Christ to 490 years. For,
supposing with Beroaldus, that Christ suffered in the 33d year of his Age, in
the 4th year of the 202d Olympiad, in the year 784 from the Building of the
City of Rome, in the 18th year of the Reign of Tiberius, in the year of the
World 3961. Supposing, I say, that according to the Synchronisms of Beroaldus,
Christ suffered in the year of the Julian Period 4745, the Beginning of these
70 Weeks, and (according to the Hypothesis of Beroaldus) the Solution of the
Babylonian Captivity of the Jews must be coincident with the year of the Julian
Period 4255, when Cyrus was dead, long before the Interval from the Beginning
of the Babylonian Epoch of Cyrus till the 18th year of the Reign of the
Emperor Tiberius, comprehending no less than 569 years, as most evidently
appears out of the following Table:

According to the Computation of Ptolemy, strengthened by innumerable
Chronological Characters it appears that,
Years. Cyrus reigned 9 Cambyses reigned 8 Darius I. reigned 36 Xerxes reigned
21 Artaxerxes I. reigned 41 Darius II. reigned 19 Artaxerxes II. reigned 4^

. 7. Those who pretend to fix the Beginning Some reject the Authority of the
ancient H^storians concerning the Persian Monarchs.
of these 70 Annual Weeks to the first year of Cyrus, and their End to the time
of the Passion of Christ, make use of this Method, that they reject the
Authority of all the most ancient profane History, and allow of no other
Persian Kings but what are mentioned in the Sacred History of these Times.
(...). 3. cap. 8.
Beroaldus says thus: Both out Modern and Ancient Profane Historians are
ignorant of the time of the Persian Monarchy, or how many Kings swayed the
Scepter over that vast Empire, as is very evident from their various and
dubious Relations. But we that are informed by the Holy Scripture concerning
the first Persian Monarchs, and know the rest out of the Ancient Monuments of
Profane History are in a better Capacity to give a solid Judgment of these
Times than ever could be expected from Herodotus, Josephus, Manctho,
Metasthenes, or Ctesias, upon whose Authority the most rely upon in the History
of these Times. And there are others also who are more rigorous in their
Judgment, in not allowing the Ancient Monuments of Profane History the least
Certainty as to this Point, and denying every thing that is not expressly
mentioned concerning these Monarchs in the Sacred History. We don't in the
least blame these Authors for extolling and maintaining the Authority of the
Sacred History, but judge it more safe to keep the middle Way: For, it would be
of very ill Consequence under the specious Pretense of a pious Intention to
reject such things as have been received by the joint Consent of most
Historians and Chronologers, and to call in question the whole Histories of
those Historians who lived next to these times, to wit, Herodotus, Thucydides,
Xenophon, Ctesias, Cnidius, (whose Monuments are transmitted to Posterity, and
remaining to this day or Theopompus, Ephorus, Tim^us, Callisthenes (whose Works
are lost, but the (...) of them to be found in Biblioth.
Diodorus Siculus.) Besides that, the Reigns of these ancient Persian Monarchs
are rendered illustrious to Posterity by many Celestial Characters, as may
beseen in Almagest. l. 5. c. 14.
Ptolemy. As to what relates to that Argument, that no other of the Persian
Monarchs are to be allowed of, but such as are mentioned in the Scripture.
Chron. l. 2. p. 58.
Vbbo Emmius has very well answered Hugo Broughton (who patronizes the same
Opinion) in the following Words* To prove their Hypothesis, they allege, that
only these Kings are named by Ezra and Nehemiah, and therefore the rest
mentioned in P^ophan^ History ought to be considered as supposititious. If this
way of arguing be allowable. I see no Reason why it may not be said with the
same Right: The Books of the Kings and the Chronicles mention only five
Assyrian Kings, to wit, Phul, Theglaphala^sar, S^^^anassar; Sennacherib,
Asar-H^^don (for Mero^^^, Nabuchodon^sor* Balshazar, and Evilmerodach were
Chaldae^^s, not Assyrians) therefore no other Kings have ruled over Assyria.
And thus we might proceed to the Kings of Syria and Egypt. Can any thing be
more weak or more vain? For what is more evident than that in the History of
one particular Nation no further mention used to be made of the Kings of the
Neighboring Nations than is requisite for the explaining or perfecting their
Relations; and that a whole Catalogue or Series of the Kings of any Nation is
not to be looked for; but in the particular History of that Nation the Author
intends to treat of. Of which, to say more would be superfluous, etc.

. 8. One of the main Questions, and the most difficult to be resolved belonging
to this Point, It was Darius Nothus whose Edict is mentioned Ez c. 6.
is, which of the three Darius's is to be understood by that Darius mentioned
by Haggai, Zechariah and Ezra. It is well known that the first Darius is
commonly sirnam'd Hystaspis, the second Nothus, and the third Codomannus.
Concerning the last, it is put beyond all Dispute by the Consent of all the
Chronologers, that he had not the least Share in this Decree or Edict; but
about the two first, the most learned Interpreters are very different in their
Opinions. Ant. Lib. 9. cap. ^.
Josephus refers this Edict to Darius Hydaspis, of whom he relates, that being
put in mind by Zorobabel of his Promise (before he was King) of rebuilding the
City and Temple of Jerusalem, and to restore all the Vessels and Utensils
carried away by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon, he joyfully granted his Request,
commanding his Governors to conduct him and his Followers safely to Jerusalem
to perfect the Structure of the Temple, and ordering those of Phoenicia and
Syria to furnish them with Cedars from Mount Libanon. But though Bishop Usher
stands up in defense of the Opinion of Josephus, yet his Relation renders the
whole very dubious: For he describes this Edict as an Effect of the Marriage
betwixt Darius Hydaspis and Esther, which, how much contrary it is to Truth, we
have spoke of sufficiently before; not to mention the unpardonable Mistake of
Josephus, when he makes those who went with Nehemiah to Jerusalem to amount to
many Millions. On the other hand, there are very strong Motives which induce us
to believe, that the Edict of the Rebuilding of the Temple was made by Darius
Nothus in the second year of his Reign. For, First, it must be understood of
the Reign of the same Darius, when the Jews lived in Cieled Houses, and the
Temple laid waste, which was the Reason they were afflicted with a general
Scarcity Hagg. 1. v. 4. c. 2. v. 16.
Now, there being but 12 years betwixt the Edict of Cyrus and the second year
of the Reign of Darius Hydaspis, it seems very improbable that in so short a
time, especially under the Reign of Cambyses, the Jews should have built
themselves Ceiled Houses, and have quite laid aside that Zeal they had so
lately shown in contributing cheerfully toward the Rebuilding of the Temple
^zr. 2. v. 68. seq.
. Secondly, it is to be understood of the Reign of the same Darius, under whose
auspicious Reign the Jews, after they had endured a great deal of Misery, began
to enjoy the Benefit of a more peaceable State, pursuant to the Words of God in
C. 8. v. 11. seq. Hag. 2. v. 9.
Zechariah: But now I will not be unto the Residue of this People as in the
former days, says the Lord of Hosts: For the Seed shall be more prosperous,
the Vine shall give her Fruit, and the Ground shall give her Increase, and the
Heavens shall give their Dew, and I will cause the Remnant of this People to
possess all these things; and it shall come to pass, that as ye were a Curse
among the Heathen and House of Judah and House of Israel, so will I save you
and ye shall be a Blessing: Fear not; but let your Hands be strong. For thus
says the Lord of Hosts; As I thought to punish you when your Fathers provoked
me to Wrath, says the Lord of Hosts, and I repented not: so again have I
thought in these Days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the House of Judah: Fear
ye not. But who is so little versed in the History of the Jewish Nation, as to
be ignorant of the many and various Calamities the Jews groaned under after the
Reign of Darius Hydaspis. Thirdly, the above cited Passages are to be
understood of the same Darius who lived and reigned many years after the
Solution of the Babylonian Captivity, it being evident out of Cap. 5. v. 6.
Ezra, that the Persian Nobles had not the least Remembrance of the Edict
published in behalf of the Jews by Cyrus: For which Reason it was that they
were obliged to search the Royal Records. But this appears in no wise agreeable
to the Reign of Dar. Hydaspis, there being but a few years betwixt the
beginning of the Reign of Cyrus, and that of this Darius, who, it is probable,
was one of the chief Persian Lords under Cyrus. But this being applied to the
Reign of Darius II. surnamed Nothus, there remains not the least Difficulty,
there being betwixt Cyrus and Darius Nothus above a hundred years. For the
Confirmation of which, I cannot but allege here the Words of His^. Univ p. ^58.
Rupertus, formerly Professor in the University of Altorf: If it was Darius
Hydaspis that granted Leave to the Jews to rebuild the Temple; how is it
possible that the Edict of Cyrus (concerning the Restoration of the Jews)
could be so entirely forgotten? For Darius Hydaspis was one of the principal
Persian Lords under Cyrus; and yet this same Darius is obliged to have Recourse
to the Records. Nehemiah was forced to inspect the Genealogies of those that
returned with Zorobabel, when at the time of Darius Hydaspis there were living
such among them as were able to give an Account of their own Descent. What can
be more absurd? When we therefore read of Darius, that he ordered the Records
to be searched; and of Nehemiah, that he was obliged to inspect the
Genealogies; we may rationally conclude with Scaliger, that the Edict of Cyrus
was not a thing of a late Date, at that time when Darius was petitioned about
the Rebuilding of the Temple; and that consequently it could not be Darius
Hydaspis who was coetaneous with Cyrus, but Darius Nothus, who granted Liberty
to the Jews to rebuild their Temple. Fourthly, The Words in Haggai and
Zechariah are to be understood of the same Darius who was, at least, the third
after Cyrus; it being evident from the following words of Cap. 4. ver. 5, 6, 7.
Ezra, that Ahasuerus and Artaxerxes reigned betwixt Cyrus and this Darius; and
that under both their Reigns the Building of the Temple was obstructed. These
are his Words: And the People of the Land hired Counselors against the People
of Judah, to frustrate their Purpose all the Days of Cyrus King of Persia, even
unto the Reign of Darius King of Persia: And in the Reign of Ahasuerus, in the
Beginning of his Reign wrote they unto him an Accusation against the
Inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem: And in the Days of Artaxerxes writ Bishlam,
Mithridat, Tabeel, and the rest of their Companions, unto Artaxerxes King of
Persia. and the Writing of the Letter was written in the Syrian Tongue, and
interpreted in the Syrian Tongue. And in the 17th and following Verses of the
same Chapter may be read the Answer of Artaxerxes, forbidding the Rebuilding of
the Temple. But betwixt Cyrus and Darius Hydaspis there reigned but one lawful
King, which was Cambyses; wherefore the Words of Ezra, both in this Passage and
in the 6th Chapter, v. 1. 15. cannot be understood from the Son of Hydaspis:
Whereas on the other Hand Darius Nothus having reigned betwixt the two
Artaxerxes's, to wit, Artaxerxes Longimanus, and Artaxerxes Mnemon, all the
Circumstances of the Holy Text concur for his Reign. Notwithstanding the
unquestionable Perspicuiry of this Argument, Dionysius Petavius has found out
another Objection against Scaliger, which has been embraced and promoted by
some of his Followers. Among the rest, a certain Modern Author Peri^^li (...).
Author has the following Words: This Cambyses, this Smerdes, the Son of Cyrus
either true or supposititious, we believe to have been the same with Ahasuerus
and Artaxerxes, mentioned in the Scripture; as appears out of the Words of C.
2. v. 2.
Daniel, where it is said, That after Cyrus, till the time of Artaxerxes, there
reigned three Kings over Persia; which would not be agreeable to the Catalogue
of the Persian Kings, if Smerdes were not numbered among them. The Objection
that there is to the Congruity both in the Letters and Syllables betwixt
Artaxerxes and Cambyses, and Ahasuerus and Smerdes, is of little Moment: For
Cambyses and Smerdes were their Names when they lived yet in a private
Condition, ^or were perhaps their Sirnames, which afterward, when they
attained the Royal Dignity, were changed and transmuted into those of Ahasuerus
and Artaxerxes. So according to L. 11. c. 6. Ant.
Josephus, the Son of Xerxes was by his Father called Cyrus, by the Greeks
Artaxerxes, and in the Scripture Ahasuerus; and if we may rely upon the
Testimony of Seder Otam C. 30.
Rabba, the Persians called all their Kings Artaxerxes. Thus fat those who
would have Darius, mentioned in ^ Ezra and by the other Prophets, to have been
the Son of Hydaspis, which is in no wise agreeable to the true Computation of
the History of these Times. And to make Artaxerxes the same with Cambyses, and
Ahasuerus the same with Smerdes, is an unaccountable Way of arguing. It is
undeniable, that among the Persian Kings there was a Supposititious or
Pseudo-Smerdes; but that he should be the same Ahasuerus mentioned in
Scripture, is not alone very improbable, but absolutely contradictory to Truth,
it being manifest out of Herodote, that this Magus did reign only a few Months;
which time he bestowed in settling himself in the Throne which he had usurped,
not in oppressing the Jews. And what is related of Ahasuerus in the Book of
Esther, has very little or no Relation to the Pseudo-Smerdes, this Impostor
having never appeared in public during his short Reign, which lasted only a
few Months, not 7 Years, as it is said of Ahasuerus Esth. 2. v. 16.
. It is also very evident from all the Circumstances of the Original Text in
Ezra, that in those ancient times; (for what happened since in that kind we will
not pretend to dispute at this time) all the Persian Kings were called
Artaxerxes's, or Artasastas's, or Ahasuerus's. There are likewise some who
maintain, that Ezra did by Artaxerxes and Ahasuerus understand one and the same
King of Persia: but contrary to the Tenure of the Sacred History, which assigns
them not only different Names, but also different Actions. For under the Reign
of Ahasuerus diverse Accusations were brought against the Jews, but without
Success: Whereas in the time of Artaxerxes the Jews were, pursuant to a Royal
Mandat, publicly opposed in the building of the Temple by their Enemies.
Fifthly, If, according to our Opinion, by this Darius, is to be understood
Darius Nothus, and the Beginning of these 70 annual Weeks be fixed in the
second year of his Reign, this Interval, as described by the Angel Gabriel,
will, by a just Computation, founded upon undeniable Chronological Characters
amount exactly to 490 years, till the time of the Destruction of Jerusalem.
Wherefore we conclude with the Words of Lib. 7. p. 591. de Emend. Temp.
Scaliger: It is, says he, very apparent, that this Darius, in the second year
of whose Reign the Rebuilding of the Temple was begun afresh, must be Darius
Nothus, who reigned betwixt the two Artaxerxes's, viz. Art. Machrocire, or
Longimanus and Artaxerxes Mnemon or Memor. The Predecessor of Artaxerxes
Longimanus could be no other Person but Xerxes, who is called Oxyares in the
Scripture, which was his Name before he obtained the Royal Dignity.

. 9. Those who differ from us in Opinion The Age of Zorobabel and Joshua are
not contradictory to our Opinion.
concerning this Darius mentioned by Ezra, make, among others, this Objection,
That our Hypothesis is not agreeable to the Age of Zorobabel and Joshua; which
Objection being answered very succinctly by Lib. 6. p. 603. de Em. Temp.
Jos. Scalig. I think it not beyond our Purpose to insert his Words: They make,
says he, this Objection; because from the time of the Edict of Cyrus, when
Zorobabel and Joshua were sent to Jerusalem, till the 2d year of the Reign of
Darius Nothus, are less or more 106 years. And, say they, how could they be
living after 106 years? But, for my part, I see no great Occasion why they
should so much wonder at it, there being not wanting Examples in the Holy
Scripture, that several Persons, but especially Those whom God had chosen
Instruments to rule his People and Church, have lived above 130 years. And
don't we see in our Age some who attain to the Age of 120 years, and are in
their full Senses? But what is most remarkable, is, that Petavius, who is the
main Champion against ours and Scaliger's Opinion, and looks upon the Age of
Zorobabel as a thing very improbable, is very liberal in attributing, at least
the same Age to Sanballat. For Lib. 13. de Doctr. Temp.
Petavius himself makes Nehemiah's Journey into Palaestine coincident with the
4259th year of the Julian Period; and it is evident out of C. 4.
Nehemiah, that the beforementioned Sanballat flourished about the same time.
Now, according to Petavius's own Hypothesis, Alexander besieged Tyrus in the
year of the Julian Period 4382; so that from the time of Nehemiah's Journey
into Palaestine (when Sanballat flourished) till the taking of Tyrus, after a
Siege of 7 Months, are to be accounted 123 years: For the before-named
Sanballat assisted in the Siege of Tyrus, and died not long after in
Alexander's Camp in the Siege of Gaza, as may be seen more at large in L. 12.
c. ^. Ant.
Josephus. From whence it is evident, that supposing this Sanballat but 27
years old at the time of Nehemiah's Journey into Palaestine, he was 150 years
old when he died, and consequently Petavius contradicts his own Opinion. But
there is something peculiar in the Age of Zorobabel and Joshua, which is so far
from carrying with it the least Improbability, that long Life was promised as a
particular Benefit from God, to all such as should return from the Babylonian
Captivity, according to (c) Zechariah: Thus says the LORD of Hosts, There
shall yet old Men and old Women dwell in the Streets of Jerusalem, and every
Man with his Staff in his hand for very Age. Many Examples might be produced of
such Persons as have lived to a great Age, in Scaliger's Behalf: But for
Shortness * ^ C. ^. v. 4.
sake, we are willing to pass them by in Silence; and refer the Reader to other
Historians.

. 10. Those who pretend that the Son of The Interval of above 100 years is not
contradictory to our Opinion.
Darius Hydaspis is to be understood in the abovementioned Passages of Ezra
and the other Prophets, allege against us, that it is very improbable that the
Inhabitants of the Country should have nourished their Hatred against the Jews
for 110 years, this being the Interval from the Edict of Cyrus to the 2d year
of the Reign of Darius Nothus. But I cannot see the least Improbability why the
Inhabitants of the Country who were professed Enemies of the Jews, and envious
of their Prosperity, should not have propagated their Hatred to their
Posterity: Wherefore I cannot but agree once more with L. 6 p. 594. de Em. Temp.
Scaliger, That since Nehemiah himself confesses, that in the 20th year of the
Reign of Artaxerxes he was for a considerable time employed in searching into,
and finding out the true Genealogies of such of the Jews as returned with
Zorobabel, and that the same is confirmed by Ezra; who says, that Darius Nothus
ordered the Royal Libraries and Records to be searched, to find out the Edict
of Cyrus. Nothing can be more evident, than that there were a very few living
at that time of those who returned with Zorobabel, that could give a verbal
Account of their Descent; and that the Edict of ^rrus was of so ancient a Date,
as to be past the Memory of Men.

. 11. Those who are not pleased with Scaliger's Whether the Passage in
Zechariah be contradict^^ ^^ to (...).
Chronological Computation, allege among other Matters, against him, that the
following Passage in C. 1. v. 12.
Zechariah contradicts his Hypothesis concerning Darius: Then the Angel of the
LORD answered and said, O LORD of Hosts, how long will thou not have Mercy on
Jerusalem, and on the Cities of Judah, against which thou have had Indignation
these threescore and ten years. From whence they draw the following
Consequence, That since from the time of the Destruction of Jerusalem, till the
second year of Darius Nothus, are elapsed above 70 years, the Restoration of
the Temple is not to be referred to that King's Reign. But Scaliger has
answered them very well, that this Passage of Zechariah is as little agreeable
to their Opinion concerning Darius Hydaspis, since these 70 years differ as
well from the time of Darius Hydaspis, as of the second year of Darius Nothus.
He adds therefore, that those 70 years of which mention is made by the Angel in
Zechariah, begin about the 29th or 30th year of the Reign of Darius Hydaspis,
when the Jews were forely oppressed by their Enemies, and their Condition grew
worse after the Death of the said Darius, about the beginning of the Reign of
Artaxerxes, as may be seen more at large in C. 4. v. 5. c. 6.
Ezra.

. 12. And thus having given you an Account of The Beginning of the 70 Weeks is
to be fixed in the 2 d year of Darius Nothus.
the different Opinions among the Chronologers concerning Darius, we will now
proceed to the main Point in question, and endeavor to prove by the following
Arguments, that the Beginning of this Interval of the 70 Annual Weeks ought to
be made coincident with the second year of Darius Nothus.

1. At what time was issued the most solemn and peremptory Mandat of the
Restoration of the City and the Sanctuary (in respect of which she is called
the Holy City) which was put in Execution accordingly, from that time ought to
begin the Computation of the 70 Weeks mentioned in Daniel;

But in the second year of the Reign of Darius Nothus such a solemn and
peremptory Mandat was issued forth:

Therefore the 70 Weeks mentioned in Daniel, etc.

The Major Proposition is evident from the Words of the Angel. It was requisite
that that same Edict, from the issuing forth of which were to begin these 70
Weeks, should have some peculiar Prerogative above all the others, which was,
that, pursuant to this Edict, the Jews rebuilt their City and Temple, which
they had not been able to effect hitherto, though backed by others. The Minor
Proposition is sufficiently proved out of Haggai, Zachariah and Ezra; from
whence it is evident, that the Decree made in the second year of Darius Nothus,
was the most solemn Edict in respect of God, who caused the same to be
published by the Prophets Haggai and Zachariah; in respect of the King of
Persia, who not only positively commanded the Restoration of the Temple, but
also threatened those who should oppose the Jews in this Undertaking, and
likewise furnished the necessary Charges; and lastly, in respect of the happy
Success which was owing to the Decree of Darius; it being said in E^^. 6. v. 1.
sequ.
Ezra, That the House was finished on the third Day of the Month Adar, which
was the 6th year of the Reign of Darius. And this Argument is so convincing,
that not only the most famous modern Chronologers, to wit, Scaliger, Vbbo
Emmius, Calvisius, Mich. Moestlinus, Franckenbergerus, and many more, but also
some of the ablest Divines; and especially Helvicus, C. 6. v. 16.
Behmius, and G. Konig Professor of Divinity in the University of Altorf, with
many others, agree in this Point, that the Beginning of these 70 Weeks ought to
be fixed at the time of the Edict issued forth in the 2d year of Darius Nothus.
LVTHER himself, though he was of Opinion, that this Darius was the same, who in
profane History is called Artaxerxes Longimanus, which Error might be very
pardon able when Chronology was as yet involved in many Difficulties, of which
it has been cleared since: Nevertheless he puts it beyond all Doubt, that the
Interval of these 70 Weeks ought to begin with the 2d year of the same Darius,
when this Solemn Edict was published, as may be seen in his Preface to the
Prophet Haggai:

2. That year, which, by counting backwards, is coincident with the 490th year
from the Destruction of the 2 d Temple, is the same year where the Interval of
these 70 Weeks ought to begin:

But the 2 d year of the Reign of Darius Nothus is the 490th year, counting
backwards from the Destruction of the 2 d Temple:

Therefore these 70 years, etc.

The Major Proposition will be proved more at large hereafter from the
Angelical Prediction, and the Term prefixed by the Angel in C. 9. v. 23. 26.
Daniel, and from a Parallel Passage in C. 24. v. 15.
Matthew. The Minor Proposition is easy to be proved; for it has been shown
before in a particular Chapter, and is approved by the joint Consent of
Scaliger, Petavius and many others of the best Chronologers, that the
Destruction of the 2d Temple happened in the year of the Julian Period 4783. If
therefore from 4783 be subtracted 490 years, there remains 4293, Year of the
Julian Period, which, that it was coincident with the 2d year of Darius Nothus
is thus demonstrable: Artaxerxes Longimanus the Predecessor of Darius Nothus
died, according to Can. Chron.
Ptolemy, in the 324th year of the Nabonassarean Epoch; and the 324th year of
the Nabonassarean Epoch is coincident with the 4291st year of the Julian
Period. If therefore the last year of the Reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus was
the 4291st year, and also the first of Darius Nothus, it follows, that the
5293d year was the second of the Reign of the same Darius.

3. That time from whence, by a just Computation are accounted 7 annual Weeks
or 49 Years, till the finishing of the Streets and Walls of the City (a due
Regard being also had to the subsequ^^^ Intervals) ought to be made the
Beginning of the 70 Weeks:

But from the 2 d year of the Reign of Darius Nothus till the finishing of the
Walls and Streets of the City, are computed 7 annual Weeks or 49 Years, without
any Prejudice to the subsequent Intervals:

Therefore these 70 Years, etc.

The Major Proposition is evident from the Words of the Angel. The Minor
concerning the 7 annual Weeks is thus proved out of C. 13. v. 6.
Nehemiah. Nehemiah after the finishing of the Walls, returned in the 32d year
of the Reign of Artaxerxes. (And that this was under Artax. Memor, we shall
have Occasion to prove hereafter.) Darius Nothus reigned in all 19 years; so
that from the 2d year of his Reign, till the 32d of his Successor are to be
computed 49 years, which exactly amounts to the Number mentioned by the Angel.
Of the other particular Intervals we shall say more hereafter.

4. According to which Opinion the Angelical Weeks (due Regard being had to
other Circumstances) begin and end with the Sabbatick and Jubilean Cycles; that
Opinion carries along with it more Probability than the others:

But our Opinion has this Prerogative, as is mentioned in the Beginning of this
Chapter:

Therefore our Opinion, etc.

The Major Proposition we prove from thence, that it appears very probable,
that when the Angel made mention of the Annual Week, he made Reflection upon
the Sabbatick and Jubilean Cycles, these being in the Holy Scripture likewise
called Weeks, as has been shown before. The Minor is proved by the Calculation
inserted in the 172d and following Pages of this Epitome.

. 13. As we have given you our Opinion concerning the Beginning of this
Interval of the 70 Who was Artaxerxes (...) by ^z^a and Nehemiah.
Weeks; so we will likewise take a View of what has been maintained by others,
especially concerning Artaxerxes, or Artasasta, in the 7th year of whose Reign
C. 7. v. 6.
Ezra went into Palestine, as did C. 2. v. 1.
Nehemiah in the 20th year of his Reign. Those who differ from us in Opinion
about the Beginning of the 70 Weeks, do also disagree with us concerning this
Artaxerxes: For those who would fix the Beginning of this Interval of 70 Weeks
to the time of these Edicts mentioned by Ezra and Nehemiah, understand by this
Artaxerxes the same who is surnamed Longimanus; of which Opinion are Africanus,
Joh. Funccius, Henr. Buntingus, Tho. Lydiott, Temporarius, Dion. Petav. Will.
Lange, Rob, Baily, and others. On the other hand Scaliger and his Followers
understand by this Artasasta, Artaxerxes II, the Successor of Darius Nothus,
the same Artaxerxes who is surnamed Memor-; which Opinion we will endeavor to
maintain by the following Arguments:

1. By Artasasta or Artaxerxes, mentioned by Ezra, is to be understood the same
King of Persia; who reigned, not only after Cyrus, Ahasuerus, and Darius
(mentioned by Ezra,) but also after another King of Persia of the same Name:

But Artaxerxes Memor, and not Artaxerxes Longimanus, is the same King, who
reigned, not only after Cyrus, Ahasuerus and Darius, but also after another
King of Persia of the same Name:

Therefore Artaxerxes, etc.

The Major Proposition is evident from the Words of Ezra in the 4th Chapter,
where he gives an Account of the Troubles befaln the Jews, under the Reigns of
Cyrus, Ahasuerus and Artaxerxes; and again in the 7th Chapter, where he
mentions another Artasasta or Artaxerxes, in the 6th year of whose Reign Ezra
did go into Palaestine: See what has been said before upon those Passages of
Ezra. The Minor Proposition we prove out of the Catalogue of the Persian Kings
and their Succession.

2. The same Artasasta or Artaxerxes, of whom it is said, that he obstructed
the Rebuilding of the Temple, and by his Edicts showed himself an Enemy to the
Jewish Nation, cannot rationally be supposed to be the same whom Ezra and
Nehemiah praises for his Affection and Benefits bestowed upon the Jews:

But Artasasta or Artaxerxes, who in profane History is surnamed Longimanus,
is the same, of whom it is said, that he obstructed the Rebuilding of the
Temple, and by his Edicts showed himself an Enemy to the Jews:

Therefore Artaxerxes Longimanus, etc.

The Major Proposition proves it self: The Minor is evident from the Words of
Ezra, cited before out of his 4th Chapter.

3. The same Artasasta or Artaxerxes, from whose Reign till the time of
Alexander the Great there is a larger Interval of Years than is suitable to the
Age of Men, and particularly to that of Sanballat and Nehemiah (according to
the Judgment of those of a contrary Opinion) is not to be supposed to be the
same mentioned by Ezra and Nehemiah:

But from the Reign of Artaxerxes, surnamed Longimanus, till the time of
Alexander the Great, there is a larger Interval of Years than is suitable to
the Age of Men, but especially to that of Sanballat and Nehemiah (even
according to the Judgment of those of a contrary Opinion:

Therefore Artaxerxes Longimanus, etc.

The Major Proposition is 1st evident from thence, that Sanballat did flourish
in the time of Nehemiah Neh. 4. Jos. Lib. 12. c. 8. Ant.
, about the year of the Reign of Artaxerxes XXVI. and likewise served under
Alexander the Great. 2dly, That Nehemiah was also living still about the time
of Alexander the Great, is manifest from thence, that he makes mention in his
12th Chapter in the 11th Verse, of Jaddua, whose meeting with Alexander the
Great is famous among the Jews. Corn. a Lapide and his Adherents have found out
this Exception, That this part of the Book of Nehemiah was not writ till after
his Death; and that Nehemiah might have seen Jaddua, not when he was High
Priest, but when as yet in his tender Years. But the first Objection has not so
much as the least Probability in it, the whole Content of the Words of Nehemiah
sufficiently evincing, that both the preceding and following Words of the
Relation concerning Jaddua could be writ by no body but Nehemiah himself: And
which way can it rationally be supposed that Nehemiah did not know Jaddua, when
it is expressly said, that he removed Manasseh the Brother of Jaddua from his
Person; because he was Son-in-Law to Sanballat. See Nehemiah Chapt. 13. v. 28.
and Josephus, Lib. 13. But, to take away all further Scruple, it is said, These
were the chief Men in the time of Nehemiah: And what is more absurd and
ridiculous than to suppose that Children were inserted in the Catalogue of the
Principal Men. The Minor Proposition is proved by the Interval of Time betwixt
Artaxerxes Longimanus and Alexander the Great: For supposing Sanballat to have
been 30 years of Age in the 20th year of the Reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus, by
adding the several Years of the Reigns of the Persian Kings to it according to
the Catalogue of these Kings, we may, without much Difficulty, investigate the
Age of both these Persons.

In the 20th year of the Reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus, Nehemiah and Sanballat
are supposed to be 30 years of Age.

Add to these the remaining Part of Artaxerxes Longimanus his

Reign, Years. 21 The Reign of Darius Nothus, 19 Of Artaxerxes Memor, 46 Of
Ochus, 21 Of Arostus, 2 Of Darius Codemannus, 4 Thus Nehemiah and Sanballat at
the time of Alexander the Great were 143 Years of Age.

4. The same Artaxerxes is understood by Ezra and Nehemiah, from the 20th year
of whose Reign, to count backwards to Cyrus, are elapsed so many years as are
sufficient to obliterate the Genealogies of those that returned out of the
Babylonian Captivity:

But this may fitly be applied to Artaxerxes Memor:

Therefore, etc.

The Major Proposition is proved out of the 7th Chapter of Nehemiah. The Minor
derives its Certainty from the beforementioned Catalogue. Neither have our
Adversaries any thing else to object against this Argument, but the Longaevity
of Nehemiah and Sanballat, which has been sufficiently answered before.

. 14. Joh. Funccius, Henr. Buntingus, Lansbergius, Whether this Computation of
Dani^l ought to begin with the time of the Edict of the 7th year of Artaxerxes,
mentioned in Ezr. 7. v. 6.
and many of their Followers are of Opinion that the beginning of these 70
Weeks ought to be fixed to the time of the Edict of the 7th year of Artaxerxes,
mentioned in Ezra. Funccius appoints its Beginning exactly on the 12th day of
March, when Ezra and the Jews began their Journey from the River Ahava toward
Jerusalem; but their Hypothesis is founded upon a wrong Basis, by confounding
Artax. Longimanus with Artax. Memor. Besides that, in the 7th year of this
Artaxerxes mentioned in Ezra (understand which of the two you will) no
particular Command or Edict was issued for rebuilding the Temple and Holy City,
but only for the Return of the Remainders of the Jews to Jerusalem under the
Direction of Ezra. And since, according to their own Hypothesis, the Structure
of the Temple was completed before, to wit, in the 6th year of the Reign of
Darius Hystaspis, it is evident that this Edict cannot have any Relation to
that mentioned by the Daniel 9. ver. 25.
Angel. Lansbergius, to avoid this Contradiction, has invented this Expedient,
That the two several Mandates or Edicts issued by Artaxerxes, one in the 7th
year of his Reign concerning the RESTAVRATION of the Jews (under the Direction
of Ezra) the other in the 20th year of his Reign, concerning the Rebuilding of
JERUSALEM, (under the Direction of Nehemiah) ought to be joined together; and
what is wanting in one to accommodate the whole to the Words of the Angel, must
be supplied out of the other. But how can it be conceived, that a certain
Number of Years can be determined and fixed to the End of a certain Term
beginning from such different times, as is the 7th and 20th years of
Artaxerxes? This Arithmetical Nicety of Lansbergius, I confess, is past my
Apprehension, nothing being more certain, than that those who attribute a
double Beginning to these 70 Weeks, must at the same time acknowledge a double
Period or End, which is contradictory to the Words of the Angel, who mentions
only (...) an Edict or Mandate, not (...), Edicts.

. 15. Africanus and Theodoretus, and among our Whether the Beginning of this
Computation is to be fixed (...) time of the 20th year of Artaxerxes.
Modern Authors, Tho. Lydiott, Joh. Temporarius. Corn. a Lapide, Joh. Vossius,
and others, who interpret the Words in Ezra and Nehemiah of Artasasta or Artax.
Longimanus, begin this Epoch of the 70 Weeks with the 20th year of this Reign,
when Nehemiah went up to Jerusalem to rebuild the Walls and Gates of the City.
But above all the rest, L. 12. c. 32. de Doct. Temp.
Dionys. Petav. patronizes this Opinion, which however he explains in a
peculiar manner: We do (says he) agree for the most part with those who begin
these 70 Weeks with the 20th Year of the Reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus: But we
differ from them in the Computation of these 20 Years, which we begin, not from
the time of the Death of Xerxes, but from the time he was made his Consort in
the Empire. So that the Beginning of the Reign of Artaxerxes admits of a
twofold Explication; one to be fixed in the 12th year of the Reign of Xerxes,
in the Year of the Julian Period 4240; the other immediately after his Death,
in the Year of the Julian Period 4249; Artaxerxes having reigned as a Consort
with his Father near 10 years, or at least enjoyed the Title of a King. And
soon after, The 20th Year of the Reign of Artaxerxes (to reckon from its first
Beginning) is coincident with the 4259th Year of the Julian Period, with the 2
d Year of the 81st Olympiad, with the Year of the World 3529. If the Epoch of
the 70 Weeks or of 490 Years be begun from this 20th Year of his Reign, its
Period is coincident with the Year of the Julian Period 4748, with that of the
World 4018, which is coincident with the 4th Year after the Passion of Christ:
So that in the third Year of the 30th Week the MESSIAH was cut off. For the
Prophecy of this Interval of 70 Weeks ought not to be interpreted thus; as if
the Mystery foretold by it was not to be accomplished till the total Expiration
of these Weeks: But it is sufficient that its Accomplishment is to be looked
for in the last Week of this Interval, though not brought quite to its final
Period. Thus far Petavius. Against this Hypothesis built upon the erroneous
Supposition, that Artasasta mentioned in Ezra and Nehemiah is the same with
Artax. Longimanus, the Arguments alleged in the preceding Paragraph may take
place for the most part: Besides which, we will insert the following Objections
in Contradiction of this erroneous Opinion. First, The Edict of Artaxerxes
(whether Longimanus or Memor) had only a Relation to the repairing the Walls
and Ditches of the City that was rebuilt before: But the Angel mentions
expressly the Words of Rebuilding of Jerusalem; And it appears very improbable
to me, that the Holy Scripture should have passed by the Epoch of Rebuilding
the City, and in lieu of it substituted, that from the Rebuilding of the Walls.
Secondly, It was foretold by the Angel, that the Streets and Walls of the City
were to be accomplished in the space of 7 annual Weeks: But if the Epoch of 70
Weeks is to be begun from the 20th Year of the Reign of Artaxerxes, how are
these 49 Years to be computed, Cap. 13. ver. 6.
Nehemiah being (according to his own Testimony) returned from Jerusalem in the
32d Year of Artaxerxes. Thirdly, if these 70 Weeks must begin in the 20th Year
of Artaxerxes Longimanus, their Period must be coincident with the Year 4760 of
the Julian Period, in which Year happened neither the Passion of Christ^, or the
Destruction of Jerusalem. For Art. Longimanus began his Reign, according to
Ptolemy and the other ancient Chronologers, in the Year of the Nabonassarean
Epoch 284: So that the 20th Year of his Reign was coincident with the 304th
Nabonassarean Year, or the 4270th Year of the Julian Period; unto which, if 490
Years be added, it produces 4760 of the Julian Period. But it is sufficiently
demonstrated in another Place, that Christ suffered Death in the Year of the
Julian Period 4746; and that the last Destruction of Jerusalem happened in the
70th Year of Christ, or in the 4783 Year of the Julian Period. From whence it
is evident that this Computation from the 20th Year of the Reign or Art.
Longimanus; which has, as I suppose, also induced Lib. 10. c 2^. de Doct. Temp.
Petavius to confess concerning this fabulous Invention, That this Opinion was
not in the least mentioned in any of the Ancient Historians. And, supposing
that Xerxes in the 12th Year of his Reign, when he was preparing for his Grand
Expedition against Greece, did (according to the Custom of the ancient Persian
Monarchs) nominate Artaxerxes his Successor, no Inference can be made from
thence, that the same Artaxerxes did 7 years after, being the 18th Year of the
Reign of Xerxes, exercise an absolute Royal Authority, when Xerxes was at home
in Person: Neither can it be alleged that Artaxerxes when he granted his
Patent to Ezra, could act otherwise than a Sovereign, and only as a Titular
King, the said Objection being contradictory to the Words of the said Royal,
Diploma, recited in C. 7 v. 11, 12. seq.
Ezra, Artaxerxes King of Kings unto Ezra, etc. I make a Decree, that all they
of the People of Israel, and of his Priests and Levites, in my Realm, which are
minded of their free Will to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee. For as much as
thou art sent of the KING and of his seven Counselors to enquire concerning
Judah and Jerusalem, according to the Law of thy God which is in thine hand:
and to carry the Silver and Gold which the KING and his Counselors have
freely offered, etc. And soon after Ezra 7. ver. ^1.
, And I, even I, Artaxerxes the King, do make a Decree to all the Treasurers
which are beyond the River; that whatsoever Ezra shall require of you; it be
done speedily, unto an hundred Talents of Silver, etc. From whence it appears,
that in the 7th year of Artaxerxes mentioned in the Scripture there reigned no
other Monarch in Persia, which induces me to argue thus:

If Xerxes had had an Intention to make his Son Artaxerxes his Consort in the
Empire, he would have done it at that Juncture of time when he was undertaking
his Expedition against Greece:

But this was not done at that time:

Therefore Artaxerxes, etc.

The Major Proposition proves it self, that Juncture of time when the King with
the Chief Men of the Empire were to go upon an Expedition remote from the
Empire, being the fittest of all to nominate a Successor. The Minor is granted
by Petavius himself, when he makes the first year of Artaxerxes coincident with
the 12th Year of the Reign of Xerxes. I argue further:

If it be true, that after the Death of Xerxes there was a Contest about the
Succession in the Empire, betwixt Darius the eldest Son of Xerxes and
Artaxerxes, his younger Son, who by the Assistance of Artapanus, obtained the
Imperial Crown; it follows, that the said Artaxerxes was not constituted King a
good many years before his Father's Death; or that he quietly exercised the
Royal Sovereign Prerogatives:

But, according to the Testimony of Diodorus Siculus, Ctesias, and other
Historians, the first is true:

Therefore also, etc.

The Opinion of Is. Vos. has so little Resemblance to Truth, that I cannot but
stand amazed how a Man of Sense, and who, besides this, pretends to a
considerable share of Learning, could fall into so many Errors at a time, which
scarce deserve an Answer.

. 16. Those who anticipate the time of this The End of the 70 Weeks is to be
fixed at the time of the Destruction of the City.
Epoch, would have this Interval of the 70 Weeks finish at the time of the
last Destruction of Jerusalem; for which they allege the Words of the Daniel
9. ver. 26.
Angel. And after threescore and two Weeks shall the Messiah be cut off. So
that, according to their Opinion, these threescore and two Weeks are to be
added to the seven Weeks mentioned before by the Angel; which together make up
59 Weeks till the final Period of this Epoch. But, as we shall have Occasion
to say something more about the Division of this Epoch in 7 and 62, so we
grant, without the least Contradiction, that the Birth and Passion of the
Messiah happened in this Interval of the 70 Weeks; but cannot see, that the least
Consequence can be drawn from the Words of the Angel, to make the final Period
of this Epoch coincident with the time of the Passion of Christ. For the very
INSCRIPTION of this Interval expresses clearly the Meaning of the Dan 9 v. 24.
Angel, which is, THE REBUILDING AND DESTRUCTION OF THE HOLY CITY: Seventy
Weeks are determined upon thy People and upon thy Holy City: And it would be
very hard to suppose that the Angel should recede in his subsequent Narration,
from what he had intimated before in his Introduction. Certainly the Relation
of an Historian would be looked upon as very incomplete, who having promised in
his Preface to give an Account of Matters till the last Destruction of
Jerusalem, should break off the Thread of his History 40 years before the said
Destruction happened. Besides, if we look upon the 26th and 27th Verses of the
9th Chapter of Daniel, it will be obvious, that the End of these 70 Weeks is
described in such a Manner as has a most particular Relation to the Destruction
of the City by the Romans, the Forerunner of which was the Abomination of
Desolation, cited by Mat. 25. v. 15. Mark. 13. v. 14.
Christ out of Daniel; and who could be a more excellent Interpreter of the
Angelical Prediction than Christ himself.

. 17. Having said enough concerning our Hypothesis Concerning the Divisi^n of
the 70 Weeks into ^^ and 62.
of the Beginning and End of this Interval, we must add something also
concerning the Division of it. These are the Words of L. 6. de emend. Temp.
Scaliger: In this Division some look for a Mystery, others divide them into
several Intervals, so as to begin the first Interval of 7 Weeks with the time
of the first Edict of Darius; the second from thence of 62 Weeks; unto which
they add one at last. I am against both: For I see no more Mystery in the
Division of this Interval of 70 Weeks, than in the Division of the Shekel in
Ezekiel, etc. Which Opinion is likewise embraced by Orat. de 70 Hebd.
Calixtus. Though we have for the most part agreed with Scaliger as to the
Beginning and End of this Epoch, yet we cannot but blame his Presumption, in
making so little Account of the Division of this Interval made by the Angel
himself; and I am persuaded that there are few who will imagine that this exact
Division of the 70 Weeks in so solemn a Prophecy as this, could be accidental
and of no Moment. See Lib. 3. can. 5^.
Clas. Philol. Sacr. And concerning the Passage in Ezekiel, with an Answer to
the Argument of Scaliger, consult Disp. 10. These. 16.

. 18. Scaliger, as he makes the Beginning of Whether the 20 and 12 Weeks have a
different Beginning.
the 70 Weeks coincident with the 2d Year of Darius Nothus, and its End with
the last Destruction of the City of Jerusalem: So he finishes the 62 Weeks with
the Passion of Christ, and fixes their Beginning in the 5th Year of Artax.
Memor, with whom agree in this Opinion, Tremellius, Junius, and several other
Modern Authors; as there are not wanting on the other hand some who allege,
that if the 70 and 62 Weeks had a different Beginning, the Word Commandment or
Edict, mentioned by the Angel, should have been expressed in the plural Number.
Those who cannot agree with the Opinion of Scaliger, I would advise to fix the
Beginning of these 62 Weeks in the 2d Year of Darius Nothus, and to include in
that Interval the 7 Weeks allotted for the Rebuilding of the Streets and Walls
of the City: But lest we should exceed the Bounds of an Epitome, we will
conclude this Chapter, leaving the Determination of the Matter to every one's
own Judgment.

CHAP. XXX. Of the Epoch of the Grecian Empire in Asia, and the Beginning of
the Epoch after the last Battle fought betwixt Alexander the Great and Darius
Codomannus, and of the Period of Calippus.
1. The Origin of the Grecian Empire in Asia, must be traced to that time when
Alexander the Great was declared Imperator over all Greece, who succeeded his
Father in the Kingdom in the same Year that Eveneto was Archon at Athens, and
L. Furius and C. Menius were Consuls at Rome.

2. Darius Codomannus began his Reign over Persia much about the same time that
Alexander succeeded his Father Philip in the Kingdom of Macedonia.

3. Just before the Grecian Expedition against Asia the Thebans were
vanquished, at which time Alexander, pursuant to the Resolution taken in the
Council, did totally destroy the City of Thebes, and thereby put all the other
Grecian Commonwealths that were much inclined to revolt, under a great
Consternation.

4. In the same Year that Ctesicles was Archon at Athens, and Caius Sulpicius
and Lucius Papyrius Roman Consuls, Alexander marched at the Head of his Army to
the Hellespont; from whence having transported his Forces out of Europe into
Asia, he fought the Battle of Granicum.

5. In the second Year of the Asiatick War, when the Battle near Issus was
fought, Nicocratus was Archon at Athens, and Caesus Duilius and L. Papyrius
Consuls of Rome.

6. In the third Year of this Asiatick War of the Greeks, Nicocratus was Archon
among the Athenians, and M. Attilius and M. Valesius Consuls of Rome.

7. In the same third Year, and in the second before the Battle of Gaugamela,
was the 114th Olympiad celebrated, where Grylus of Chalcedon carried the Day;
and in the same Year Tyrus was likewise taken by Alexander.

8. In the 4th Year of this Asiatick War, when Darius was vanquished at
Gaugamela, Aristophanes was Archon of Athens, and Sp. Posthumous and T.
Veturius Roman Consuls.

9. In the same Year that the Battle of Gaugamela was fought, Alexander, after
his Return from the Temple of Jupiter Hammonius, founded the City of
Alexandria. For these Characters we are obliged to Lib. 17.
Diodorus Siculus, which are for the most part approved by other Historians.

10. Alexander, after the Victory obtained over Darius near Gaugamela, made
himself Master of Asia in the 5th Year of his Reign, according to Lib. 11. v^r.
14.
Justin.

11. The same Year was the 5th Year of Darius, at its Beginning Ptolemy
allowing but four years for the Reign of Darius.

12. Eleven Days before this last Battle fought betwixt Darius and Alexander,
there happened a very remarkable Eclipse of the Moon, according to Vit. Alexand.
Plutarch.

13. The same Eclipse has been observed, according to Plutarch, in the Month of
Bo^dromion, toward the latter End of the Summer, or the Antumnal Aequinox; at
which time the Greeks used to celebrate the Eleusinia, dedicated to Ceres, of
which In Herc. Far.
L. An. Seneca has the following Words:

Quanta cum longae redit hora noctis,
Crescere and somnos cupiens quietos
Libra Phoebeos tenet aequa currus:
Turba secretam Cererem frequentat,
Et citi tectis properant relictis,
Attici noctem celebrare mystae:
Tanta per campos agitur silentes
Turba, etc.
This Eclipse happened in the year of the Julian Period 4383, on the 20th day of
September, 4 little before Midnight, the whole Obscuration being of 14 Inches;
Of which Eclipse L. 2. c. 70.
Pliny likewise makes mention.

14. The next following Summer after the Victory obtained by Alexander near
Gaugamela, Calippus Cyzicenus began a new Period of 76 years, as is evident
from the four Observations of Timocharis upon the years 36, 37, 47, and 48,
mentioned by L. 7. c. 3.
Ptolemy,

15. In the same year that Calippus began this New Period, Darius, whilst he
was gathering Recruits in Bactria, and the circumjacent Provinces, was made
Prisoner by Bessus his own Lieutenant over the Province of Bactria; who having
fettered him with Golden Fetters, at last murdered him, when Aristophanes was
Archon at Athens, and Cn. Domitius and Au. Cornelius Roman Consuls. In this all
the Ancient Historians do agree, but especially Loc. Cit.
Diodor. Sicul. From these Characters we conclude that the Battle of Gaugamela
was fought in the year of the Julian Period 4383, Cycl.. 15.. 13. on the first
day of October; and that the Period of Calippus began with the Summer of the
4384th year of the Julian Period, Cycl.. 16.. 14. and that Dar. Codoman. the
last Monarch of Persia was slain in the same year.

If therefore from any certain year of the Julian To find out the year since
the Beginning of these Ep^c.
Period be subtracted 4382 years and 9 months, the Residue shows the year since
the beginning of the Grecian Empire in Asia, or since the Battle fought near
Gaugamela: And if 4383 years and six Months be subtracted in the same manner,
the Residue is equivalent to the year since the Beginning of the Period of
Calippus, or the Death of Dar. Codomannus. But if to these years of these
Epocha's be added the before mentioned Number of years, the several Products
will be correspondent to the several years of the Julian Period.

. 1. L. 2. Hist. Sacr. Pers.
PEtrus Bizarrus has made a very large The Occasion of this Afratic War, and of
the ensuing Revolution.
Collection of the Motives which induced Alexander the Great to engage in a War
against Darius Codomannus. The Remembrance of the past Injuries and Troubles
the Greeks had received from the Hands of Darius Hydaspis and Xerxes; the
private Quarrels with the Family of Alexander, who had not only been
contumeliously treated by the Ambassadors of Darius, and in his Letters, in
which he called himself the King of Kings, and Alexander his Servant, but also
his Father's Death, upon whose Head Darius had set a vast Sum of Money, and had
done the like to Alexander himself. But the chief Motive was his immensurable
Ambition to build his future Greatness upon the Ruin of the professed Enemies
of his Country, as may be conjectured from that Epistle writ by Alexander in
Answer to the Letter of Darius mentioned by L. 17.
Diodorus Siculus.

. 2. The Battle which decided the Fate of the Asiatick Empire betwixt the
Persians and In what place this Battle was fought.
Greeks; and from whence begins this Epoch, is commonly called the Battle of
Arbela, whilst others are of opinion that it was fought near Gaugamela. It
seems to be very strange how the Historians could confound these two Places
which lie at about 600 Stadia from one another; Of which I can give no better
Account than to allege the Words of Lib. 16. Georg. p. 507. ad Cause.
Strabo: Arbela, says he, is under the Jurisdiction of Babylon, and situated
not far from it. On the other side of the River Lycus, in the Plains of Aturia
is the City of Ninus. In the Province of Aturia is likewise the Village of
Gaugamela, famous for the great Victory obtained by Alexander the Great against
Darius, etc. But the Macedomans seeing Gaugamela to be but a poor Village, and
Arbela a considerable Place, built (as it is reported) by Arbelus the Son of
Athmoneus, they dispersed it abread, that they had fought and obtained this
signal Victory near Arbela, which has misguided several Historians into this
Error. Of which consult the Notes of Freinshemius upon Curtius.

. 3. L. 5. de Emend. Temp.
Joseph Scaliger is of Opinion, that Whether Plutarch committed an Error in his
Character of the Lunar Eclipse.
Plutarch committed an Error in the Character of this Lunar Eclipse mentioned
before. But the Matter duly weighed, this Objection is made without sufficient
Reason, against an Historian of so extraordinary a Reputation. For he does not
mention expressly any certain Day of the Month Bo^dromion, but only the Feast of
Eleusinia, which was celebrated by the Greeks for several Days together.
Besides that, the Constitution of the Attick Year as proposed by Scaliger, and
according to which he has corrected Plutarch, is not sufficiently established
and approved among us, which is, questionless, the Reason that Calvisius, who
otherwise never fails to follow closely the Footsteps of Scaliger, has not made
the least Animadversions upon this Passage of Ptolemy; for which Reason it is
also our Opinion that this Character of so ancient an Author ought not to be
rejected.

CHAP. XXXI. Of the time of the Death of Alexander the Great, and the Epoch of
the Years of Philip.
1. Alexander the Great lived 32 Years and 3 Months, which are to be computed
from the first Year of the 106th Olympiad, when Philip the Father of Alexander
received the Congratulations about the Victory obtained by Sarmenio over the
Illyrians, according to L. 7.

Eclipse observed at Aracta; both the great Luminaries being in the Sign of the
Lion; and that the same Eclipse happened in the year of Christ 891, on the 8th
day of August about Noon, is manifest from the Ecliptical Calculations.
Albategn. 11. The Death of Alexander is thus related by Vit. Alex.
Plutarch: On the 18th day of the Month Daesius, being seized with a Fever, he
remained all that Night in the Bath. The next day after Bathing he hept his
Bedchamber, where he played at Tables with Medius. Having bathed again at
Night, and assisted at the Sacrifice, he eat with much Eagerness. The same
Night his Fever returned again. The 20th day of the Month, after having bathed
again, he assisted at the Solemn Sacrifice; and being laid down in the Bath, he
passed his time with a certain Commander of a Ship, who gave him a Relation of
his Voyage, and of what he had observed otherwise most remarkable in the Ocean.
The 21st being passed in the same manner, his Fever increased toward Night:
And the next day the Fever growing more violent, he was carried from thence to
another Place near the great Bath, where he entertained himself with the
Generals of his Army, giving his Orders to them. On the 24th day, his Fever
still increasing, he would assist at the Sacrifice, whither he was forced to be
carried; and ordered the Generals and other Chief Men to tarry within the
Court, and that the Colonels and Captains should keep Guard without the Gates.
On the 25th he was carried into one of the inner Apartments of the Castle,
where he slept a little; But his Fever did not diminish. When the Generals came
to attend him he had already lost the Use of his Tongue, which continued thus
on the 26th. The Macedonians believing him to be dead, came in a tumultuous
manner to the Gates; and having forced those that attended to admit them within
the King's Apartment, they all passed one by one without their Arms by his Bed.
On the same day Python and Seleucus were dispatched to the Temple of Serapis to
consult the Oracle whether Alexander should be conveyed thither: But they
received for Answer, that they should not remove Alexander from the Place he
then was in. On the 28th toward Night he died. Thus it is recorded in the
Diary. 12 It is very probable that the Month Daesius of the Macedonians was in
the same Year coincident with the Month Thargelion of the Athenians; of which
these are the Words of Aelianus L. 2. c. 35. Var. Hist.
: It is reported also that Alexander was born and died on the self-same Day,
being the 6th of the Month Thargelion. 13. After the Death of Alexander, and
many and long Debates among the Generals, Aridaeus the Son of Philip, who also
had taken the Name of Philip, was by the Majority of Suffrages constituted
King, and Perdiccas, unto whom Alexander, when at the Point of Death, had given
his Ring, was chosen Regent; pursuant to which all the Governors of the
Provinces and other principal Officers were ordered to obey their Commands.
This was done in the same year when Cephisodorus was Archon of Athens. Diod.
Sic. L. 68.
From these Characters it is evident that Alexander died in the Spring of the
4391st year of the Julian Period, Cycl.. 23.. 2. and that from the same year,
about the Summer Season, when another Archon succeeded at Athens, the
Philippean Period had its Beginning.

If therefore from any certain year of the Julian To investigate the year sin^e
the beginning of these Epoc.
Period given, 4390 years and 3 Months be subtracted, the Residue shows the
year since the Death of Alexander the Great. To find out the Year since the
Beginning of the Philippean Period, several Months more must be subtracted. And
if the same Number of Years and Months be added to the year since the Beginning
of these Epocha's, the Product will be correspondent to the year of the Julian
Period.

. 1. THere is some Dispute about the true About what time Alexander died.
time of the Death of Alexander the Great. For A. Gellius allots no more than
11 years for the Reign of Alexander; whereas L. 15.
Strabo. accounts as many after his last Victory obtained against Darius. But
neither of these two are of sufficient Authority to counterbalance what has
been said before concerning the true time of his Death.

. 2. It is also called in question whether his How Alexander died.
Death was occasioned by Poison or Debauchery. Of the first Opinion is L. 16.
c. 16.
Justin. He was (says he) vanquished at last, not by the Bravery of his
Enemies, but by the Perfidiousness of his own Friends and Subjects. And Curtius
L. 10.
says expressly, It was believed that his Death was occasioned by Poison, etc.
But Vit. Alex.
Plutarch says, that this Account of his being made away by Poison, was looked
upon as a Fiction; because his Body showed not the least Marks of it after his
Death, though it laid several Days exposed to the Heat of the Sun, whilst the
Contentions lasted among the Generals.

. 3. After the Death of Alexander the whole The Change of Affairs after the
Death of Alexander.
Body of this vast Empire was torn in many Pieces, among which four Kingdoms
are the most remarkable, pursuant to the Vision of Daniel. For Ptolemy seized
Egypt, Seleucus Babylon, Antigonus the Lesser Asia, and Antipater Macedonia and
Greece.

. 4. The Histories of these Times make Mention of two Philips; the first Philip
the Son Who was that Philip that gave the Name to the Philippean Period.
of Amyntas II. Father to Alexander the Great; the second Aridaeus, the natural
Brother of Alexander. Scaliger, Christmannus, Serarius, and others attribute
the Origin of this Epoch to the first: But the same having been unknown till
after the Death of Alexander the Great it appears more probable to me, that it
owed its first Offspring to Philip the Brother of Alexander, who was born of
Philinna a Thessalian Lady, and Mistress to K. Philip. See L. 18. Bibl.
Diod. Sicul. For the rest, the Philippean Years were, according to De D. N. c.
21.
Censorinus, like the Nabonassarean Years.

CHAP. XXXII. Of the Epoch of the Seleucides, which is also called the
Grecian and Alexandrian Epoch, and of the Convenant and Therick DHILCARNAIN,
mentioned in the Book of the Maccabees.
1. The Epoch of the Seleucides, used especially among the Asiaticks, owes its
Name and Offspring to Seleucus; and has its Beginning at that time when the
said Seleucus had made himself Master of Babylon, and the Provinces of Media
and Susa. 2. Seleucus made himself Master of Babylon in the same Year that
Polemus was Archon of Athens. 3. In the same year that the 117th Olympiad was
celebrated, when Parmenio of Mitylene got the Victory in the Race. 4. In the
same year that L. Papyrius was the 5th time, and C. Junius the 2 d time Roman
Consuls. All which Characters are related by C. 69.
Diod. Siculus. 5. In the 148th year of the Grecian Epoch, Judas the
Maccabean did purge the Temple of Jerusalem, after its Profanation by the
Gentiles 1 Mac. 4. v. 52, 53.
; which Restoration of the Temple happened in the first year of the 145th
Olympiad, according to L. 12. c. 11. Ant.
Josephus. 6. The 150th year of this same Epoch, when Antiochus Eupator
besieged Jerusalem, was a Sabbatick Year 1 Mac. 6. v. 53.
Jos. L. 12. c. 14.
. 7. After the Death of Alexander the Great, Onias the High Priest ruled at
jerusalem; at which time Seleucus having made himself Master of Babylon,
reigned sole Monarch in Asia in the 12th year after the Death of Alexander. 8.
From Seleucus, to account backwards to Cyrus, are computed 248 years. These two
Characters are expressed in the same Words by L. 8. 6. 2. demon. Evang.
Eusebius. 9. The Year 1194 of the Epoch Therick Dhilcarnain, which in the
Nurenburg Edition of Albategnius, illustrated with Notes by Joh. Regiomontanus,
is called ADILCANARI) was coincident with the 1206th year since the Death of
Alexander. 10. The year 1202 of the same Epoch, in which happened a notable
Eclipse of the Sun, was 1214 after the Death of Alexander, according to C. 27.
10.
Mahomet the Son of Cruen, in his Book de Scien. Stellar. And it is manifest
from the Astronomical Tables, that the Eclipse of the year 1202 of the Epoch
Therick Dhilcarnain is coincident with the year of Christ 891, the 8th, day of
August. 11. Nothing certain is to be determined concerning the Months of the
Years of this Epoch; which are in the first Book of the Maccabees frequently
begun with the Month of Nisan. See 1 Mac. 7. v. 1. c. 9. v. 3. c. 10. v. 1, 21.
c. 13. v. 22, 41. c. 16. v. 14. But in the 2 d Book of the Maccabeans, and
those of the Jewish Historians, from the Month of Tisri.
From whence it appears, that the Beginning of this Epoch is coincident with
the year of the Julian Period 4402, Cycl.. 6.. 13. and that the Author of the
first Book of the Maccabeans speaks for the most part of the Vernal Season of
this year; in the 2 d of the Autumnal.

If therefore 4401 years and 3 Months be subtracted from any certain year of
the Julian Any certain year given of the Jul. Period to find out the year since
the beginning of this Epoch.
Period, the Residue shows the year since the Beginning of the Grecian Epoch,
according to the first Book of the Maccabeans: And if 4401 Years and 9 Months
be subtracted in the same manner, the Residue will be equivalent to the Number
of years since the Beginning of the same Epoch, according to the 2 d Book of
the Maccabeans.

. 1. Lib. 15.
JVstin relates that this Seleucus was the Who was Seleucus that gave Birth to
this Epoch.
Son of Apollo and Laodice. After the Death of Alexander the Great, when his
Empire was divided among the Generals of his Army, this Seleucus had Syria for
his share; but being forced from thence by King Antigonus he sought for Shelter
by Ptolemy King of Egypt; till returning at the Head of a considerable Army, he
made himself Master of Babylon, in Remembrance of which this Epoch was
instituted.

. 2. The Jews call this Epoch the Era of The Jews call this Epoch the Era
^f the Covenant or Principalities.
Contracts or Covenant, or the Era of Principalities; because, as they say,
when Alexander the Great, after he had made himself Master of Persia, marched
toward Jerusalem with an Intention to destroy that City, he was met by the
High Priest Simon, who otherwise is called Jaddus; who having prevailed with
him to alter his Intentions, upon this Condition, that all the Sons of the
Priests that were born in the same year should be called Alexanders. This
Epoch was from thence called the Epoch of Contracts or Covenants; as may be
seen in Wilhelmus Schickardus, who in his Preface to the Tarich of the Persian
Kings, alleges the Words of Rabbi Abraham the Levite. But L. 10. de Doct. Temp
c 42.
Petavius deservedly ridicules the Ignorance of the Jewish Interpreters, who
pretend that the Beginning of this Epoch was at the time when Alexander had
made himself Master of Asia; whereas the same did not arise till 12 years after
his Death, and 18 years after his Interview with the High Priest. For which
Reason I prefer the Opinion of those who call this Epoch the Era of
Principalities; because after the Death of Alexander his Empire was divided
into many Principalities.

. 3. The Arabians called this Epoch of Seleucus, This Epoch is called Therick
Dhilcarnain ^^ the Arabians.
Therick Dhilcarnain, and the Greeks (...), which signifies as much as the
Horned Epoch. Christmannus is of Opinion that the Arabians and Greeks have
called Alexander the Horned, as being Monarch both of Orient and Occident.
Wilhelmus Schickardus and others maintain that he was called thus, because he
vanquished Darius Codomannus, who by C. 8.
Daniel is compared to a Ram. But Scaliger's Opinion seems to be preferred
before the rest, who derives this Denomination from thence, that Alexander was
reputed the true Son of Jupiter Ammon, and the supposi^itious Son of Philip:
For, according to Schickardus himself, the Arabians used to call those that
pimped for their Wives, and educated Bastards under the Pretense of their own
Children, HORN-BEASTS.

. 4. Joseph Scaliger and L. 10. c. 43. de Doct. Temp.
Dionysius Petavius Whether the Author of the 2 Book of the Maccabeans begins
always these Years from the Month Tisri.
maintain that the Author of the 2d Book of the Maccabeans constantly begins
the Years of this Epoch with the Month Tisri; but it being said in the 2d Book
of the C. 15. v. 37.
Maccabeans that it was decreed that the 13th Day of the 12th Month should be
celebrated; which Month is called in the Syrian Tongue ADAR; this contradicts
the Opinion of Scaliger and Petavius. For, if at that time the Month of ADAR
was the last, it follows, that the Month of NISAN was the first, they beginning
their Year with the Spring. For the rest, those Authors who mention this
Epoch, make use sometimes of the Nabonassarean Years, sometimes of the Julian
Years; of which see L. 10. c. 40. de Doct. Temp.
Dionysius Petavius.

CHAP. XXXIII. Of the Epoch and time of the Asmoneans, who were afterward
called Maccabeans.
1. This Epoch must be regulated according to the true Succession of
Mattathias, Judas Maccabeus, Jonathan, Simon, etc. as expressed in the Books of
the Maccabeans, and by Josephus. 2. Mattathias began to be famous about that
time when Antioc. Epipha. 3. The same Mateathias died in the 146th year of the
Grecian Epoch 1 Mac. 2. v. 70.
. 4. In the 148th year of the same Epoch, Judas Maccabeus Son of Mattathias,
rendered himself famous by restoring the Levitical Service among the Jews 1 Mac
4. v. 52.
. 5. In the 152 d year of the Grecian Epoch Jud. Maccab. was slain in the
Battle fought against Bacchides, and was succeeded by his Brother Jonathan 1
Mac. 9. v. 3. 18. 28.
. 6. Jonathan being murdered by the Treachery of Tryphon, 1 Mac. 12. v 48.
Simon his Brother was made Prince over the Jews, and fought with such Success
against the Gentiles, that it was under his Government said of the Jews, 1 Mac.
1^. v. 41, 42.
In the 170th Year the Israelites were delivered from the Yoke imposed upon
them by the Heathens: And from that time on they used to write in their
Inscriptions, IN THE FIRST YEAR OF SIMON THE CHIEF HIGH PRIEST, GENERAL AND
PRINCE OF THE JEWS. 7. The 172 d year of the Grecian Epoch was coincident
with the 3 d year of Simon the Chief High Priest 1 Mac. 1^. v. 27.
. 8. The Epoch of Simon began with the Ecclesiastical Year, or in the Spring 1
Mac. 13. v. ^1.
. 9. The last of the Asmonean Race was Antigonus the Son of Aristobulus the
Brother of Hyrcanus, whom Antonius caused to be nailed to the Cross (which was
the first Instance of that kind of Execution of a King among the Romans) and
after he had been well scourged, to be strangled. See L. 14. Antiqu. c 29.
Jos. and L. ^9.
Dio. 10. The Government of the Asmoneans, till the Death of Antigonus, lasted
126 years; and was succeeded by Herodes, surnamed the Great. See L. 14. c. ult.
L. 15. c. 1. Ant. L. 1. c. 13* de Bell. Jud.
Jos. and L. 1. c. 3. de Excid. Hierosol.
Hegesippus.
From these Characters it is evident that the Asmonean Race flourished about
the year of the Julian Period 4548, Cycl.. 12.. 7. at which time Mattathias
died: That in the 4549th year of the Julian Period Jud. Maccab. acquired
immortal Glory among the Jews, by restoring their public Service; and that he
was slain in the year of the Julian Period 4555: And lastly, that the Epoch of
Simon had its Beginning in the year 4571 of the Julian Period.

How any certain year of the Julian Period may How to find out any year of
these Epocha's.
be conveniently connected with the years of these Epocha's, is sufficiently
evident from what has been said upon this Point in the preceding Chapters, to
wit, for the year since the Death of Mattathias, must be subtracted 4547 years;
for the year since the Restoration of the Levitical Service by Judas, 4548
years; and for the year of the Epoch instituted in honor of Simon, must be
subtracted 4570 years and three Months, etc.

. 1. THE Words of Josephus, where he relates the Family of Mattathias being The
Derivation of the Name of the Asmoneans.
ambiguous, some have made the Word Asmonean a proper Name, others an
Appellative. It is, I think sufficient for us to know that the Word Asmonean
signifies as much in the Hebrew as Great Men and Governors; in which Sense it
is explained by Rabbi Kimchi.

. 2. Many who insist upon the Promise of Of which Tribe the Asmoneans were
descended.
the Scepter of Judah, would have the Asmoneans descended from the Tribe of
Judah; of which Opinion are Genebrardus and Baronius: But the last of these two
has changed his Opinion in his last Edition of his Annals, it being evident out
of the Books of the Maccabeans 1 Mac. 2. v. 1. c. 14. v. 29.
, that the Asmonean Family was descended from the Tribe of Levi; which is
likewise agreeable to the Genealogy of Josephus L. 12. c. 8.
. What is alleged by some of the Asmonean Race to be descended on the Mother's
side from the Family of David, is of no great Consequence, it being not
customary among the Jews, to let the Succession pass to the Females.

. 3. Judas the Son of Mattathias was the first How they were called Maccabeans
afterward.
who was surnamed the Maccabean 1 Mac. 2. v. 3.
: But concerning the Interpretation of this Word there are diverse Opinions. L.
3. Art. Cab.
Johan. Reuchlinus and Serrarius would have it to have been an Inscription in
the great Standard of Judah, and to signify as much as WHO IS LIKE UNTO THE
LORD AMONGST THE GODS? And that Judas from thence had received the Surname of
Maccabean. But L. 2. 13. misc.
Fullerus interprets it, THROUGH ME IS THE PLAGUE, to wit, in Reference of the
refractory Gentiles and Apostates.

. 4. Many Learned Men are of Opinion, The Administration of the Government was
in the Tribe of Levi before the Asmoneans.
that the supreme Administration of the Government among the Jews was not
lodged in the Tribe of Levi till the time of the Asmonean Family, but contrary
to Truth: For L. 20. c. 8.
Josephus says expressly, that after the Return of the Jews to Jerusalem by the
Command of Cyrus, Jesus the Son of Josedec was High Priest; WHO, says he, AND
WHOSE POSTERITY, in all Fifteen, governed the Jewish Commonwealth till the time
of Antiochus Eupator. St. Jerome In Jer. c. 22. in Ez. c. 21.
consents with Josephus, and In C. 1. Ez.
Lyra has the following Words: God governed his People after they had taken
Possession of the Land of Promise, by three different Forms of Government:
First, by the Judges, of which in the Book of the Judges. Secondly, by the
Kings, of which in the Book of the Kings. Thirdly, by the Highpriests, from
their Return out of the Babylonian Captivity, till Christ. And it is remarkable
what is related by L. 11. c. 8.
Josephus, that when Alexander the Great stood in need of the Assistance of the
Jews at the Siege of Tyrus, he directed his Letters written for that Purpose to
Jaddua the then High Priest.

CHAP. XXXIV. Of the Antiochian Epoch or (...).
The Chief Characters of the Antiochian Epoch are, 1. The Beginning of this
Epoch is coincident with that time when the Battle of Pharsalia was fought;
where Pompey 's Army was put to an entire Rout, and he himself slain soon after
through the Perfidiousness of Septimus, Salvius, and Achillus. 2. The 2 d year
of the Reign of the Emperor Leo was the 506th (...), in which year, to wit, on
the fourth day of the Month Gorpiaeus (the same with the Month of September by
the Romans) happened a great Earthquake, which shook almost all the Houses of the
New City, according to L. 2. c. 12.
Evagrius. 3. In the 150th year of this Epoch, under the Reign of Trajan there
happened another most terrible Earthquake, mentioned by the same Evagrius. 4. In
the 575th year of this Epoch, on the first day of the Month of Xanticus (our
first of April) the Emperor Justin being at the Point of Death, constituted
Justinian, his Sister's Son, his Consort in the Empire, according to the same
L. 4. c. 9.
Evagrius. 5. The first year of this Epoch is coincident with the 1969th year
of Abraham. Eusebius. Upon which year Eusebius speaks concerning the Antiochian
Computation. 6. In the same first year of this Epoch began likewise the first
INDICTION, which was followed afterward by others, as it is well observed by
Scaliger; so that the Antiochian Years divided by 15, the Residue shows the
true Character of the Cycle of Indictions.


From these and other Characters, but especially those remarked by Evagrius, it
may be concluded that this Era began in the year of the Julian Period 4665,
Cycl.. 17.. 10. in Autumn.

If therefore 4664 Years and 9 Months be subtracted Any certain year given of
the Julian Period to f^^d out the year since the beginning of this Epoch.
from any certain year of the Julian Period, the Residue shows the year since
the Beginning of the Antiochian Epoch.

1. IN the Chronicle of Alexandria it is observed that Liberty was proclaimed
at Antiochia This Epoch began in Autumn.
on the 20th day of May; which, if it be so, it follows, that the Epoch of the
Antiochian Liberty had its Beginning before the Battle fought betwixt Caesar
and Pompey; The Battle of Pharsalia being, according to the Testimony L. 3. B.
G.
of Caesar himself, fought when it was near Harvest-time: But most of the best
Chronologers agree in this point, that this Epoch had its Beginning, not in
the Spring, but in the Autumn next preceding the Battle of Pharsalia: For which
Reason Scaliger and Calvisius appoint the first day of October for the
Beginning of this Epoch, which, in my Opinion, would have been better on the
22d of September, this having been anciently the Beginning of the Indictions.

. 2. John Christopherson an Englishman, a famous Why this Epoch is called
(...).
Interpreter of the ancient Graecians, has translated the Words of Evagrius,
where he makes mention of (...); in the Year in which Antiochia received its
Name; but quite beyond the Purpose; Antiochia having received its Name above
260 Years before this Epoch, from Antiochus; besides that the Greek Word does
not admit of this Explication. The Opinion therefore of Scaliger appears most
probable, that thereby they had a Respect to the Cycle of Indictions, which was
begun with the first Years of this Epoch.

CHAP. XXXV. Of the Julian Epoch.
The Julian Epoch begins with the Correction of the Calendar, which was begun,
1. When Caesar, then High-Pontiff, was the third time, and Em. Lepidus Consuls
of Rome, according to C. 2. De Die Not.
Cens. and Dio. 2. The Julian Years owe their Offspring to the 4th Consulship
of Caesar, according to the same Cens. Loc. Cit. 3. The 283 d Julian Year is
coincident with the same Year that Ulpius and Ponticanus were Consuls at Rome,
and with the Year since the Building of the City 991, according to Cens. Cap.
21.


From whence we conclude that the first Julian Year began on the first of
January, in the Year of the Julian Period 4669, Cycl.. 21.. 14. and that
consequently the preceding 4663th Year was the Year of Confusion.

If therefore 4668 years be subtracted from any certain given year of the
Julian Period, the Any certain year given of the Jul. Period to find out the
year since the beginning of this Epoch.
Residue shows the year since the Beginning of this Epoch. And if to the Year
of this Epoch the beforementioned Number of Years be added, the Product
easily shows the Year of the Julian Period.

. 1. JVlius Caesar finding that the Pontiffs of Why Caesar altered the Form of
the Year.
Rome, whose Care it was to intercalate the Years which were to be Lunae-Solar
Years, had abused their Authority, and managed this Intercalation according to
their own Convenience, and to oblige their Friends according as they were
inclined to lay down, sooner or later, their Magistracies, resolved to correct
this Corruption: Of which see Censorinus.

. 2. Lib. 26. Rer. Gest.
Ammianus Marcellinus gives an Account How this was affected.
at large how Caesar proceeded in the Correction of the Old Calendar; The Sum
and whole Basis of which is, That Sosigenes did make the Solar Tropic Year
consist of 365 Days and 6 Hours; but that the 6 Hours were not to be accounted,
till (all together) they made up one Day, which was to be added to the 4th
Year, on the 22d of February; so that this Interval of 48 Hours was to be
accounted for one and the same Day. Of which see also Celsus.

. 3. The Year of Romulus began with the How the Months were ordered in the
Julian Year.
Month of March, according to the Poet:

Martis erat primus mensis, Venerisque secundu^,
Haec generis princeps, ipsius ille pater.
Tertius a Senibus, Juvenum de nomine quartus,
Quae sequitur numero turba vocata fuit.
But under the Reign of Numa Pompilius the Romans were pleased to add the two
Months of January and February; so that January was the first; of which the
Poet has the following Words:

Primus erat Jani mensis, quia janua prima est,
Qui sacer est imis manibus, imus erat.
Postmodo creduntur spatio distantia longo
Tempora bis quini continuasse viri.
At the time of Julius Caesar therefore the same Order was observed in the
Months which is retained to this day.

. 4. The Motive that induced Caesar to begin the Julian Year with the first of
January, or Why Caesar begone the Year with the first of January.
the Hybernal Solstice is thus represented by the Poet:

Dic age frigoribus, quare novus incipit annus,
Qui melius per Ver incipiendus erat?
Omnia tunc florent, tunc and nova temporis aetas,
Et nova de gravido palmite gemma tumet, etc.
After having said much more in Praise of the Spring, the Poet makes this
Answer:

Bruma novi prima est; veterisque novissima Solis,
Principium capiunt Phoebus and annus idem.
. 5. The Year which preceded the first Julian Of the Year of Confusions.
Year was called the Year of Confusion; because it consisted, by reason of the
Neglect of the Intercalations, of 15 Months or 445 Days, as is evident from the
Words of Censorinus. Caesar, says he, when High-Pontiff of Rome, in his third
Consulship, and in the first of Emil. Lepidus, to correct what had been
neglected before, intercalated two Months consisting of 67 Days, betwixt the
Months of November and December, having already added 23 Days to the Month of
February, and this made that Year to consist of 445 Days. And Vit. Caes.
Suetonius represents the Correction of Caesar in the same manner; from all
which it is evident that the Year of Confusi^^ began on the 14th day of
October, in the Year of the Julian Period 4667.

. 6. Though Caesar had been very careful in appointing the exact time of
Intercalation; yet The Correction of the Julian Tears.
Caesar having been slain in the second year of this Epoch, out of Ignorance
of those who had the Management of the Calendar, these Intercalations were made
sooner than it ought to have been; which induced Octavius Augustus to undertake
the Reformation of these Julian Years, which is thus related by Macrobius: The
Priests, says he, have given Occasion to a new Error by their Intercalations.
For, whereas they ought to have intercalated that Day which is made up out of
four times 6 Hours, at the latter End of each 4th year, at the Beginning of the
5th; they did make this Intercalation at the Beginning of each 4th year. This
erroneous Intercalation was continued for 36 years together; in which time 12
Days, were intercalated instead of 9. This Mistake was likewise corrected by
Augustus, who ordered that the 12 next following years should not be
intercalated; that these three Days, which, by the Over-hastiness of the
Priests, were introduced, might be swallowed up thus in this Interval.
Afterward he ordered (pursuant to Caesar 's Intention) that at the Beginning
of each 5th year one Day should be intercalated; and that this should (for an
everlasting Remembrance) be cut in Brass.

. 7. It is undeniable, that there is some Mutation in the Ingress of the Sun
into the Celestial Whether the Julian Years need another Correction.
Points; and that likewise the Feasts of Easter have been misplaced in the Old
Calendar. Nevertheless I cannot see any sufficient Reason which should induce
us to approve of the Gregorian Correction or any other; but rather to retain
the ancient Form of the Year, as in the times of Julius Caesar, and without
cutting off a Day, by reason of the Preceding Equinoxes, to investigate the
Plenilunium Paschale out of the most exact Astronomical Tables; and to ^ix the
Feast of Easter on the first Feria next ensuing the said Plenilunium, thus
following the Footsteps of both the Emperors Julius and Constantine. For it is
well known, that the first regulated the Public and Civil Records according to
the Motion of the Sun, in which he followed the Opinion of Sosigenes, and his
Solar Year. We have before us the Examples of many great Mathematicians, and of
Ptolemy himself, who did not reject the Fasti Nabonassarei; though in the same no
Account was made of the Hours belonging to the Solar Year; and what should move
us to pretend to any new Alterations in the Julian Calender, which agrees much
more with the Celestial Motions? For, what Detriment is it to the Commonwealth,
if ^^e Equinox be fixed now on the 9th or 10th Day of March, which, in the
times of Julius Caesar used to fall out upon the 23d Day of the same Month? On
the other hand, what a Confusion would it be, if by rejecting the Julian Year
we should be put under a Necessity of rendering useless all the Astronomical
Tables and the Julian Period? For which Reason it is, that Johannes Keplerus,
who was Mathematician to three Emperors, when he compiled his Tabulas
Rudolphinas, did not follow the Method of Gregorius, but retained the Julian
Computation: Neither need we (like Gregorius) be at the Charge of many thousand
Pounds to find out the Paschal Plenilunes; the same being without great
Difficulty to be investigated out of the Astronomical Tables, where the
Equinoxes and Plenilunes have their exact appointed times. To be short, as the
Church does not impair the Civil Power, so the Feasts need not interfere with
the Imperial Records; especially at this time when we may make use of the Words
of the Col. 2. v. 16, 17.
Apostle, Let no Man judge you in respect of any Holy Day, or the New Moon, or
of the Sabbath Days, which are a Shadow of things to come.

CHAP. XXXVI. Of the Epoch of the time of Herod and the Reigns of the Foreign
Kings over the Jews.
1. Herod, who afterward was surnamed the Great, was by Antipater declared
Prince of Galilea, when he was scarce 15 years of Age. L. 14. c. 17. Antiq. L.
1. c. 8. de Bell. Jud.
Josephus. 2. This was done after Julius C^^^r had put a happy Period to the
Alexandrian War, and had conferred great Honors upon Antipater the Father of
Herod. L. ^4. c. 15. 17. Ant.
Jos. 3. This same Herod soliciting for Succors against the Parthians, was by
Anthony and Augustus, with Consent of the Senate and People of Rome, declared
King of Judaea in the 184th Olympiad, when C. Domit. Calv. the second time, and
C. Asin. Pollio were Consuls of Rome, whose Consulate was coincident with the
Year before Christ 40, according to the vulgar Epoch. See L. 19. v. 26.
Jos. 4. The City of Jerusalem was besieged and taken by Herod and Sosius in
the Sabbatick Year, when M. Agrippa and Canid. Gallus were Consuls at Rome in
the 185th Olympiad, in the third Month, on the Day of their great and solemn
Fast; on which Day the said City was likewise taken by Pompey 27 years before.
See L. 14. c. 18. Ant.
Josephus. These Characters show the taking of this City to have been
coincident with the 37th year before Christ. 5. The Battle betwixt Anthony and
Augustus was fought near the Promontory of Actium in the 7th year after Herod
had taken the City of Jerusalem, according to Josephus L. 15. c. 17.
; which Battle happened in the 31st year before Christ, and in the 15th Julian
Year, as shall be shown hereafter. 6. Herod was confirmed in the Kingdom, and
had the Crown, which he had laid down of his own accord, restored to him, when
Augustus marched into Egypt, which was in the 2 d year after the Battle of
Actium, and the 30th year before Christ. 7. Herod lived but eight Days
(Josephus says five) after he had caused his Son Antipater to be slain. He
reigned in all forty years. Chron. Temp. Sec. 8. The 18th year of the Reign of
Herod was the 15th year after his taking the City of Jerusalem, and in the same
year he began to rebuild the Temple which he had caused to be pulled down
before. See L. 17. c. 10. Ant.
Josephus. 9. The Days that Herod reigned over all the Jews are 37 years, and
Herod died; a Man who had been very prosperous in his Undertakings. These are
the Words of the Hebrew Text of L. 5. c. 41.
Josephus, translated by Sebastianus Munsterus from the Constantinopolitan
Copy, and published by Hen. Petrus in the year 1540 at Basil. For the true time
of the Beginning of the Reign of Herod over all the Jews must be computed from
his taking the City of Jerusalem. 10. When Herod 's Recovery was despaired of,
Judas Sariphaeus and Matthias Margalothus made their Attempt upon the Golden
Eagle; for which they and their Adherents were burnt alive: And in the same
Night happened a Lunar Eclipse, and the King grew worse. See L. 17. c. 8.
Josephus. Another such Eclipse happened a year before the vulgar Epoch of
Christ. 11. The Tyrant died not many Months before the Feast of the Passover:
For Archelaus, who, by the last Will of Herod was appointed his Successor in
the Kingdom, did engage at the time of the Feast of the Passover with those
that were risen in Rebellion to revenge the Death of Matthias and his Friends;
of whom, after he had slain several thousands, he ordered that all such as by
reason of the Feast were come to Jerusalem, should return to their Homes. See L
17. c. 11.
Josephus. 12. Our Savior's Birth, and the Murder of the Children of Bethlem
under two years of Age, of which mention is made in c. 2. v. 16.
Matthew, happened before the Death of Herod. 13. Archelaus, before he had
reigned quite 9 years, was despoiled of the Kingdom, and banished into France;
Jos. l. 2. c. 6. de Bell. Jud.
after which, Judaea, from being a Kingdom, being annexed to the Province of
Syria, Quirinus or Cyrenus was sent thither as Governor, to take their
Inhabitants, and to dispose of the private Estate of Archelaus. Quirinus
brought along with him Coponius a Commander of a Body of Horse, unto whom he
left the Administration of Affairs in Judaea Jos. l. 17. c. 1.
. It was in the 37th year after the Battle of Actium, and the taking of
Alexandria Jos. l. 18. c. 3.
, that this Taxation was made, which is coincident with the 7th or 8th year of
the vulgar Era of Christ.
According to these Characters we conclude that the time of Herod is to be
regulated in the following manner. He was made Prince of Galilea about the year
of the Julian Period 4667. 2. He was declared King at Rome in the Year of the
Jul. Period 4674. 3. He conquered Jerusalem in the year of the Jul. Period
4684. 4. Augustus confirmed his Reign in the year of the Jul. Period 4684. 5.
He rebuilt the Temple of Jerusalem about the year of the Jul. Period 4691. 6.
He died in the year of the Jul. Period 4713. before the Feast of the Passover.
7. His Successor was banished about the year of the Jul. Period 4721.

If therefore any certain year of the Julian Period be given, subtract from
that year for the Beginning of the Princely Dignity of Herod 4666 years; for
the Beginning of his Reign 4673. years; for his Conquest of Jerusalem 4676
years; for his being confirmed in the Kingdom by Augustus 4683 years; for the
Rebuilding of the Temple 4690 years; for his Death 4712 years for the
Banishment of Archelaus 4720 years: And if the same Numbers which have been
subtracted, be added to the several years known by the Residues, the Products
will be correspondent to the years of the Jul. Period.

. 1. NIch. Damascenus who was a familiar Friend Of the Family of Herod.
of Herod himself, traces his Origin from the Babylonian Jews; which, though it
has been contradicted by Josephus, yet has been embraced by the Author of the
Hebrew History cited by Ad Sulp. Sever. p. 250.
Drusius, and among the Christians by Torniellus, Africanus, Eusebius,
Baronius, Serrarius, and others, deduce his Origin from the Philistians of
Ascalon; but Josephus makes Herod an Idumean; which is a Demi-Jew; the
Idumeans, who were conquered by Joh. Hircanus having embraced the Jewish
Religion, which being the most probable Opinion, is likewise confirmed by the
Testimony of the Author of the Chronicle of the 2d Temple.

. 2. Is. Causab. Sealiger, Kepleras, Torniellus, Herod was made Governor of
Galilea in the 15th year of his Age.
Spanhemius, Langius, and almost all the modern Chronologers accuse Josephus of
a notable Error in appointing the 15th year of Herod's Age when he was made
Prince of Galilea by his Father Antipater; in lieu of which they would have it
25 or 26 years. But the Circumstances of the whole History sufficiently evince
that Josephus did commit no Mistake in putting 15 instead of 25. The only
Objection is, that according to Josephus himself, Herod was but 15 years old at
the time of the Alexandrian War, and the Beginning of the Julian Epoch; and in
the 45th year of the Julian Epoch; when he died, he is said to have been 70
years old. To which it is to be answered, That the Word (...), made use of by
Josephus, may be taken here for one of above 60 years old; or else, that the
Text is adulterated in this Passage, rather than contradict so many
unquestionable Circumstances relating to this History.

involved in no small Difficulties. Joh. Kepl. Dion. Petav. and Fred. Spanhem.
refer his Death to the 42d Julian Year, to wit, three years sooner than has
been asserted by us: But Herod having received the Royal Diadem in the 6th
Julian Year after the Feast of the Passover, from thence to the 42d Julian Year
cannot be computed more than 35 years; whereas Josephus expressly mentions 37
years. Furthermore, if Herod be supposed to have died in the 42d Julian Year,
it must follow, that our Savior was born in the 41st Julian Year; from whence,
to the 74th Julian Year, which is coincident with the 15th year of the Reign of
Tiberius, are about 33 years; which, according this Hypothesis, must have been
the Age of our Savior; which is contradicted by C. 3. v. 1. 23
St. Luke: and, to affirm, that Herod died before the Birth of Christ, is
contrary to the Evangelical History.

. 4. Those beforementioned Authors, who What Reasons are alleged against our
Opinion.
anticipate the Death of Herod three years before us, allege in their behalf
the Text of Josephus, which mentions not only 37 years for the Reign of Herod,
but also attributes complete 9 years for Archelaus after the Death of Herod.
If, say they, the Coronation of Herod happened in the 6th Jul. Year, from thence
to the 42d Jul. year when Herod died, are 36 years. And, if from the 51st
Julian Year when Aemilius Lepidus and C. Arun. Nepos were Consuls at Rome; and
which, according to L. 5
Dio Cassius, happened the Banishment of Archelaus, the 9 years of his Reign, be
subtracted, the Residue is correspondent to the 42d Julian Year, when Archelaus
succeeded his Father. This, they say, appears further out of the Computation of
the Years of Philip the younger Son of Herod. The 37th year of his Age, which
was his last, is made coincident by L. 18. c. 6.
Josephus with the 20th year of the Reign of Tiberius; but the 20th year of the
Reign of Tiberius began in September in the 78th Julian Year; of which, if the
36 years of Philip be subtracted, the Residue is again correspondent to the 42d
Julian Year, when Philip succeeded his Father Herod in some Part of the
Kingdom. It cannot be denied that this Computation carries along with it a
great Probability, if the same were also agreeable to the other
beforementioned Characters. According to this Hypothesis, the whole Series of
the History of the Jews must be called in question, or else that Josephus was
only misguided in the Relation of the History of Herod; or else, that these
Errors are crept in by the Negligence of the Transcribers. But the safest way
is to keep to these Characters mentioned at the Beginning of this Chapter, and
not to reject these Demonstrations for the sake of some Niceties.

against Keplerus and Petavius, it is to be observed that these two have made
but little Reflection upon the Character of the Lunar Eclipse mentioned by
Josephus.

make the Death of Herod coincident with the 43d Julian Year, or the year of

years appropriated by Josephus to the Reign of Herod: But since this Opinion
labors under the same Difficulty with the former, in respect of the Eclipse of
the Moon, I choose rather to follow the Opinion of Scaliger, than to grapple in
the Dark when it is left to my Choice to walk in the Light.

. 7. The Celestial Characters having been always Unto what time the Lunar
Eclipse is to be referred.
considered as the surest Guides for the Chronologers, most of those Authors
who dispute about the true time of the Death of Herod, have endeavored to
bring that notable Eclipse of the Moon mentioned by L. 17. c. ^8. Ant.
Josephus, within the Compass of their several Hypotheses. Laurentius
Codomannus An. S. Script. p. 69.
has the following Words of this Eclipse: `In the year of the World 4133, a
little before Midnight which followed the 8th day of November, in the 2d year
of Christ, happened that Eclipse of the Moon mentioned by Josephus in the 17th
Book and 8th Chapter. The next following day being the 9th day of `November,
Herod the Great being then very ill, etc. Tho. Lydiott maintains that this same
Eclipse happened in the Beginning of the Night which followed the 20th day of
February of the 52d Julian Year. Joh. Keplerus, and Dion. Petavius declare for
that Eclipse of the Moon which happened on the 13th day of March, 2 Hours and 45
Minutes after Midnight. C. 149. p. 75.
Joh. Georg. Herwart ab Hoe^burg in his New and Truly Astronomical Chronology,
makes this Eclipse the same with that which happened in the 47th Jul. Year, and
the 754th year since the Building of Rome, according to Varro's Computation;
when on the 20th day of February the Moon was eclipsed an Hour before Midnight,
the Sun being at that time in the 29th Degree, 51 Minutes of Aquarius. Wilhelm.
Langius alleges that Eclipse for the true one, which happened in the 44th Julian
Year in the Morning, on the 20th day of January, the End of which was seen at
Arbela, and the Middle in some more Oriental Parts. But Scaliger is of Opinion
that the Lunar Eclipse mentioned by Josephus, near the time of the Death of
Herod, happened on the 8th day of January, in the 45th Jul. Year. Thus has this
memorable Character so industriously observed and set down by Josephus proved
the Apple of Contest among the Chronologers. To give the best Judgment we can
in so difficult a Point, it ought to be observed, that those who have bestowed
so much Pains in applying these Eclip^es to their Hypotheses, have lost much
Labor and Time, unless the same be likewise agreeable to the other
Circumstances. Thus it may rationally be supposed that the Lunar Eclipse
mentioned here by Josephus was visible at Jerusalem, it being mentioned as a
peculiar Character belonging to the History of the Jews; and the Word (...)
seems to intimate that the same happened near Midnight, not in the Evening or
Morning, in Opposition to Langius. It is also very probable that the same was
not so inconsiderable as it is made by Petavius; but that it was very
remarkable and worth the taking notice of by so great an Historian. There is
also another Circumstance worth our particular Observation; that there must be
betwixt this Eclipse and the ensuing Passover an Interval sufficient for the
transacting all those Matters that are related in that Place by L. 1. c. 21. de
Bell. Jud.
Josephus: Herod falling dangerously ill after this Eclipse, consulted the
Physicians; and after he had for some time used their Prescriptions, he was by
their Advice carried to the Bath. After his Return from thence he received
Letters from Rome; and finding himself grow worse and worse, he caused
Antipater to be slain, and died not till five Days after: After which were
celebrated the Funeral Rites with great Pomp, his Corpse being carried from
Jericho to Herodium above 200 Stadia. After all this had been transacted, the
Slaughter of several thousands ensued at the time of the Passover, all which is
not probable that it could have been done in so few Days as Keplerus and
Petavius allot for this Interval. So that the whole matter duly weighed,
Scaliger's Opinion deserves to be preferred before all the others; of which we
will give you a Scheme in the following Table:

Josephus, that he died when he had lived 70 years, and that he had received
the Government of Galilea in the 15th year of his Age; from whence he
concludes, that the 37 years mentioned by Josephus ought to begin with that
time, when Augustus gave him the Title of King, being not permitted to reckon
the preceding Years among his Reign; and that consequently the first of the 37
years was coincident with the 15 Julian Years, in which happened the Battle
near Actium, when Augustus was the third time, and Messala Consuls of Rome; in
the 2d year of the 178th Olympiad: So that the Nativity of Christ happened at the
Beginning of the 29th year of this Epoch; and Herod's Death in the 8th year of
Christ. Tho. Lyddiot has for the greatest part followed the Footsteps of
Baronius. But this Opinion is founded upon such Suppositions as are altogether
groundless; no Inference being to be made from Herod's being confirmed in the
Kingdom by Augustus, that he was deprived of the Royal Title and Dignity,
before the Phrase Confirmare aliquem in Regno, not implying among the Romans to
create one a King, which is manifest from thence, that Herod had before
obtained the Royal Dignity by the mutual Consent of Anthony and Augustus and
the Approbation of the Senate.

. 9. The Words spoken by the Jews to our Savior, Forty and six years was this
Temple in Concerning the 46 years mentioned in St. Joh. c. 2. v. 20
building, have puzzled the Interpreters, some of whom have explained them of
the Temple built by Zorobabel; but it is evident from the History of Herod,
that they spoke in this Passage of the Temple that was rebuilt by Herod, which
was begun in the 18th year of his Reign and in its Height in the 28th year of
his Reign; and not brought to its Perfection till 46 years after the first
Preparations were made for this great Structure. There is one Objection against
it, which is, that L. 1^. c. 14. Ant.
Josephus says in another Place, that the Temple of Herod was built in 18
Months, which is to be understood from its outward Parts, though there are also
some who interpret the Interval of 46 years betwixt the 18th year of the Reign
of Herod and the first year after the Baptism of Christ thus; that the
Structure of the Temple was interrupted for some time.

Macrobius is the only Person among Whether mention is made of the Murder of

the Profane Historians, who makes mention of the Murder of the Children by
Herod in these Words: Augustus having understood that among the Male Children
under two years of Age, which were slain in Syria by the Command of Herod his
own Son had been among their Number, he said, It is much better to be the Hog
than the Son of Herod. There are not wanting such as look upon this as a mere
Fiction. Others refer these Words of Augustus to the Murder of his Son
Antipater; others to another Son of his under two years of Age, who was slain
among the rest at Bethlehem; and that Antipater's Murder happened after that of
the Male Children, which is evident from L. 1. c. 8. Hist. Eccles.
Eusebius and L. 7. c. 8, 9. Ant.
Josephus: the first of which says expressly, that the Murder of the Children
of Bethlehem was committed before Herod fell ill; and the last affirms, that
Antipater was not slain till five days before his Death.

. 11. Scaliger admires what could induce Josephus did not mention this Murder
of the Male Children.
Josephus to pass by in Silence this Murder of the Children under two years of
Age at Bethlehem in the History of Herod; which is not only excused, but
defended by P. 159. Chr. Sacr.
Isaac Vossius; who alleges in his Behalf, that after so many Cruelties and
Murders of Wives, Sons, Relations and Friends, committed by Herod, Josephus
looks upon this as so inconsiderable as scarce to deserve a Place in his
History. But that this Murder was not so inconsiderable as Vossius would
persuade us is sufficiently testified by C. 2. v. 16, 17, 18.
St. Matthew in the following Words: Herod slew all the Children that were at
Bethlehem, and in all the Coasts thereof, from two years old and under, etc.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the Prophet, saying, In RAMA
was there a Voice heard, LAMENTATION and WEEPING, and GREAT MOURNING; Rachel
weeping for her Children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.

. 12. The common Opinion is, that our At what time happened this Murder of the
Children at Bethlehem.
Savior was born on the 25th day of December; and that on the 13th day after,
being the 6th of January, the Wise Men came to Jerusalem, and from thence went
directly to Bethlehem, where, having paid their Adoration, and being warned of
God, they returned homewards immediately after; and that Herod seeing himself
mocked by the Wise Men, had thereupon perpetrated that Piece of Cruelty against
the Children at Bethlehem; so that the whole was transacted before the
Purification of the Virgin Mary in the first Month of the forty fourth Julian
Year. But if the Matter be duly weighed, we shall find that this Computation is
in no wise agreeable to the true Chronological Circumstances. For whether these
Wise Men came out of Arabia or Persia, certain it is, that they could not
perform so great a Journey in 13 Days after the Apparition of the Star, which,
according to the Evangelist, was the SIGNAL of the NEWBORN KING; considering
especially the Inconveniences of the Winter Season. It is also worth
Observation, what is related by the Evangelist Matthew. 2.
, That Herod flow all the Children that were two years old and under. Herod had
been, questionless, informed by the Wise Men, that they had been near a whole
Year upon their Journey since the time of the Apparition of the Star, which
induced Herod to cause all the Children of two years old and under, to be
slain. So that it may be more probably concluded from the Words of the Matthew.
2. v. 16.
Evangelist, that Christ was at that time about one year old, than that he was
of a few Days; and that the Wise Men did not come to adore Christ in his Cradle
a considerable time after the Purification of his Mother, about the Beginning
of the second Year of Christ, and the forty fifth Julian Year.

about 11 years after the Death of Cleopatra, began to compute their years from
the Reign of Augustus, to show their ready Submission and Obedience to their

CHAP. XXXVIII. Of the Epoch of the Battle of Actium used among the Egyptians.
1. Octavius took up Arms against Anthony, who having receded from the Rules
agreed upon betwixt the Triumviri, and being entangled in the Snares of
Cleopatra, had given unto her (to the no small Detriment of the whole Roman
Empire) the Provinces of Phoenicia, Syria, Cyprus, a great part of Sicily, of
Judaea, and that part of Arabia Nabataea that extends its self toward the
Ocean. 2. After the Death of Sext. Pompeius, the King of Armenia was taken
Prisoner; and the other Nations which were engaged in War against Caesar, were
forced to submit, and the Parthians restored to a peaceable Condition. 3. The
chiefest Motive which induced Caesar to arm against Anthony, was, that he had
understood that Anthony had called Caesario in his last Will the Son of Julius
Caesar, and had ranged him amongst the Family of the Caesar's. 4. This Civil War
betwixt Caesar and Anthony begun after the Philippean, Perusian and Sicilian
Wars, when Cn. Domitius and C. Sossius were Roman Consuls, both of the
Anthonian Faction. 5. In the same year that the Battle of Actium was fought,
Caesar was the third time, and Vai. Messala Roman Consuls. See L. ^0. Hist. Romans
Dio Cassius, Vit. Antoni^.
Plutarch, In Octav. August.
Suetonius, Florus, Eutropius, Orosius, and others. 6. The Battle of Actium was
fought in the 7th year of the Reign of Herod, at which time he was raising
Forces for the Service of Anthony; who having refused to accept of them,
ordered him to employ them against the Arabians. See Lib. 15. c. 6, 7. An^.
Josephus. 7. The Battle of Actium was fought on the second day of September,
according to Dio, sub initio Lib. 1. 8. In the next following year Octav.
undertook the second Expedition against Anthony and Cleopatra, who then laid
violent Hands upon themselves. This happened when Octavius was the 4th time, and
M. Crassus Consuls of Rome. According to Loc. Cit.

THOT. See Ptolemy. 13. The 42 d year of Augustus was the 28th year since the
Conquest of Egypt and the Death of Anthony and Cleopatra, the last of the

Verses:

Et vacuam patefacit aulam,
Fortuna lustro prospe^a tertio

Laudemque, and optatum, peractis
Imperiis, decus arrogavit.
From these Characters it is certain that the Battle near the Promontory of
Actium was fought in the year of the Julian Period 4683, Cycl.. 7.. 9. on the 2
d day of September; and that Alexandria, after the Defection of Anthony 's
Fleet to Caesar, was taken in the next following year, and that of the Julian
Period, 4684, Cycl.. 8.. 10. on the first day of August, and that in the same
Month Cleopatra following the Example of Anthony, laid violent Hands upon her
self.

If therefore from any certain year of the Julian To investigate the Year since

year since the Battle fought near Actium. And if 4683 Years and 7 Months be
subtracted in like manner, the Residue is correspondent to the year since the
Conquest of Alexandria and Egypt by Octavius Augustus.

next following Year from the Conquest of the City of Alexandria: Since which
time others have begun their Computations from the time that the Egyptians
received the Julian Year instead of the Nabonassarean, which was done in the
Seven hundred and twenty fourth Nabonassarean Year, on the Twenty ninth of
August.

CHAP. XXXIX. Of the Epoch of the Augustus's.
1. Both the Years and Name of the Augustus's owes it Origin to that time when
Octav. Caesar was entitled with the Name of AUGUSTUS by the Roman Senate, which
Title has since been transmitted to all his Successors. 2. Octavius was not
surnamed AUGUSTUS till after he had entered the City thrice in Triumph, had put
a Period to the Civil War, restored Tranquillity to the whole Roman Empire, had
heaped great and many Benefits upon the City and People of Rome, had filled up
the Senate with his Friends, and had the legal Administration of the Government
conferred upon him by the Senate and People of Rome. 3. At which time Octavius
was the 7th time, and M. Vipsan. Agrippa the 3 d time Consuls of Rome. See L.
2. Hist. Romans
Dio, C. 21.
Censorinus, and Aur. Cassiodorus. 4. When Egypt was reduced under the Roman
Jurisdiction two years before. Loc. Cit.
Censorinus. 5. The Years of the AUGUSTUS'S begin with the first of January,
though Caesar was entitled with the Name of AUGUSTUS by L. Munatius Plancus,
and the rest of the Roman Citizens, on the 14th of January. See Censorinus,
with whom very nearly agrees Ovid, when he says thus:
Idibus in magnis castus Jovis aede Sacerdos
Semimaris flammis viscera libat ovis.
Redditaque est omnis populo provincia nostro:
Et tuus AUGUSTO nomine dictus avus.
From these Characters we conclude that the Epoch of the Augustus's, and the
legal Administration of the Government by the Caesar's, began with the Month of
January, in the year of the Julian Period 4687, Cycl.. 11.. 13.

of this Epoch: For some begin it with the Death of Julius Caesar; others with
the first year when Octavius was Consul of Rome, which was in the third Julian
Year; Some from the time of the Triumviral Division, being the 6th Julian Year;
others from the time of the Battle of Actium, being the 15th Julian Year;
others from the Conquest of Alexandria and Egypt; others at last from the time
Octavius received the Title of AUGUSTUS.

. 3. Suetonius gives us the Reason why Octavius Why Octavius was firnamed
Augustus.
was firnamed Augustus in the following Words: Oct. Augusti Cognomen assumpsit,
Munatii Planci sententia: cum quibusdamcensentibus, Romulum appellari oportere,
quasi and ipsum conditorem urbis, praevaluisset, ut Augustus potius vocaretur,
non tantum novo, sed etiam ampliore cognomine: quod loca quoque religiosa, and
in quibus augurato quid consecratur, augusta dicantur, ab auctu, vel ab avium
gestu, gustuve: As Ennius likewise relates in the following Words:

Augusto augurio, postquam inclyta condita Roma est.

And in the same Sense says Ovid, L. 1. Fastor.

Sed tamen humanis celebrantur honoribus omnes:
Hic socium magno, cum Jove nomen habet.
Sancta vocant Augusta patres, augusta vocantur
Templa Sacerdotum ^ite sacrata manu.
From hence also the Greeks call it Venerable and Sacred, according to Lib. 3.
Dio; but the Germans have committed an Error in the Etymology of this Word,
when they have interpreted Augustus an Increaser of the Empire.

Julian Period and the Julian Years.

In the Year of the Jul. Period 4651, 23d of September, Octavius was born.

In the Year of the Jul. Period 4670, in the 2d Jul. Year, in the 19th Year of
the Age of Octavius, on the 15th of March, Julius Caesar was slain; and

CHAP. XL. Of the True and Vulgar Epoch of CHRIST.
To regulate the Epoch of the Nativity of Christ, both according to the Tenure
of the Sacred and Profane History, these following Characters must be observed.
1. Our Savior was born in the Days of Herod the King, who was succeeded by
Archelaus Mat. 2. v. 1. 22.
. 2. When Octavius Augustus was Emperor of Rome Luke 2. v. 1.
. 3. By whom was sent out a Decree that all the World should be taxed Ibid.
. 4. And this Decree was made first when Cyrenius was Governor of Syria Luke
2. ver. 2.
5. In the 15th year of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being Governor of
Judaea, and Herod being Tetrarch of Galilee, and his Brother Philip Tetrarch of
Iturea, and of the Region of Trachonitis, and Lysias the Tetrarch of Abylene;
Annas and Caiaphas being the Highpriests, etc. JESUS himself began to be about
thirty years of Age, being (as was supposed) the Son of Joseph, which was the
Son of Heli Luke 3. v. 1, 2, 23.
, 6. In the 6th Month after Elizabeth had conceived John by Zecharias the
Priest of the Course of Abia, after the Days of his Ministration were
accomplished, the Angel Gabriel was sent to announce to the Virgin Mary the
Conception of Christ Luke 1. v. 23. 26, 36.
. 7. Thus says Clem. Alexandrinus: Our Savior was born in the same 28th year
when the fixed Decree was made by Augustus about a Taxation: Which, doubtless
was said in Reference of what is related by Lib. 1.
Dio Cassius; That the Day when Alexandria was taken by Augustus, was ordered
to be kept as an Anniversary Feast, from whence was to be begun the Computation
of the following Years. 8. It was therefore in the 42d year of the Reign of
Augustus, and in the 28th after the Conquest of Egypt, and the Death of
Anthony and Cleopatra, that our Savior JESUS CHRIST was born; at the time of
the first Taxation by Cyrenius then Governor of Syria, in the City of
Bethlehem of Judaea, pursuant to the Prophecies of the Prophets: These are the
Words of L. 1. c. 5. Hist. Eccles.
Eusebius. with whom agree, as to the Year of Augustus, L. 1. Haer.
Clem. Alexandrinus, Epiphan Contr. Jud. c. 8.
Tertullian, L. 1. c. 1. L. 7. c. 2.
Paul. Orosius, Chr. Eusebius.
St. Hierome, Isodorus, Jornandes, Zonaras, etc. 9. The Death of the Emperor
Commodus happened 194 years after the Nativity of Christ. But the Emperor
Commodus was murdered (according to Clem. Alexandrinus L. 1. Str.
) in the year of the Egyptian Era 222. His Death is described by Dio Cassius
L. 72. H. R.
. 10. At the time of the Nativity of our Savior Lentulus and Messala were
Roman Consuls; though there are also some who refer his Nativity to the
Consulship of Augustus the 13th time, and of Plautus Sylv. See Aurel.
Cassiodorus, Geo. Cedrenus, Lib. 1. Haeres.
Epiphan. Lucius Dexter, Mar. Scotus, etc. 11 Christ was born in the Year of
the Constantinopolitan Epoch 6506, Cycl.. Graec. 18.. 15. See Geor. Cedren.
12. Christ was born on the 23 d day of December, according to the vulgar
Opinion; which Opinion was already generally received at the time of Theophilus
Bishop of Caesarea in Palaestine, who lived under the Reign of Commodus and
Severus: And Vict. Pictav affirms, that in the 3 d Age after the Nativity of
Christ, the same was celebrated among the Christians about the Hybernal
Solstice, which Custom was afterward retained by those present at the General
Councils of Baset and Florence; as also the ancient Roman Catholic Writers of
the Martyrologies, Breviaries, Diaries, etc.


From these Characters it seems evident to me, that our Savior was born in the
Year of the Julian Period 4711, Cycl.. 7.. 18. on the 25th day of December.

If therefore 4711 years be subtracted from any certain Year given of the
Julian Period, the Residue How to investigate the Year of this Epoch.
shows the Year since the Beginning of this Epoch, etc.

But there being a Difference of two whole years betwixt the vulgar Computation
and this; If therefore 4713 years be subtracted from any known Year of the
Julian Period, the Residue will be correspondent to the Year since the
Beginning of this Epoch: Or if the said 4713 years be added to the known year
of this vulgar Epoch, the Product will show the Year of the Julian Period.

And if, according to the Opinion of some, the Computation be begun in the Year
preceding the vulgar Epoch, let the same be subtracted from the 4714th Year of
the Julian Period; and the Residue will show the Year of the Julian Period,
correspondent to the Year next preceding the Nativity of Christ. And if the
true Year of the Julian Period be known, and you would investigate the Year
before the Beginning of the vulgar Epoch, subtract 4714 years from the known
Year of the Julian Period, and the Residue will show the Year next preceding
the vulgar Epoch.

FRed. Spanheim. Syn. disp. select. Exc. 8.
Joh. Cloppenburgius, Whether it be impossible to find out the true year of the
Nativity of Christ.
Joh. Vossius, and many others, are of Opinion that it is impossible to
determine the true Year of the Nativity of Christ. They allege that the
uncertain Beginnings of the several different Epocha's, and their unequal
Conceptions, and uncertain Foundations, together with the various
Interpretations of so many Authors of Note, are insuperable Difficulties. They
add to this the Institution of the Christian Epoch, not till a considerable
time after the Nativity of Christ, the different Opinions and Computations
concerning the Reign of Herod's, the Taxation of Cyrenius, and the thirty Years
of Christ; from whence they conclude that all the Opinions of the Chronologers
concerning this Epoch, are founded upon false and uncertain Conjectures. But
we being, in the Constitution of this Epoch guided by the Sacred Writ, the
Authority of very ancient Chronologers, and the unquestionable Truth of the
Celestial Characters this Epoch may be looked upon as entangled in some
Difficulties; but ought not to be numbered amongst the Impossibilities.

. 2. The Interpreters are much divided in their Opinions concerning the
Taxation under Concerning the Taxation under Cyrenius.
Cyrenius, the main Difficulty arising from thence, that at the time of the
Nativity of Christ, Sentius Saturninus, and not Cyrenius, was Governor of
Syria: For L. 17. c. ult. Ant. and L. 18. c. 1.
Josephus enumerates the Governors of Syria, in the following Order: Sentius
Saturninus, Quintilius Varus, Quirinius: Besides that, he makes not the least
Mention of the first Decree of Augustus at the time of the Nativity of Christ,
but only of the Taxation under Cyrenius after the Banishment of Archelaus and
the Death of Herod. To resolve this Difficulty, the Interpreters have had
Recourse to diverse Explications. Theodorus Beza pretends to correct the Text of
St. Luke, and to substitute the Word (...) for the Word (...). But, besides
that it is of very ill consequence to correct the Sacred Text, neither
Porphyrius, nor Julian the Apostate, though they were not unacquainted with what
is said in the New Testament concerning the Taxation of Cyrenius under the
Reign of Herod, never attempted to contradict it; and Apol. 2. pro Christ.
Justin Martyr alleges in his Behalf the Taxation-Books made by Cyrenius.
Calvin and Salmero accuse Josephus of a Mistake in the time of the Taxation of
Cyrenius: But, to lay so gross an Error at the Door of so great an Historian,
is, in Effect, to call in question the Veracity of his whole History. Neither
am I of the same Opinion with Eusebius L. 1. c. 5. Hist. Eccl.
, who maintains the Taxation mentioned by L. 17. c. 15. L. 18. c. 1.
Josephus, to have been the same with the Taxation, of which mention is made by
St. Luke, Spanhemius having sufficiently shown the great Difference there is
betwixt them. Chron. c. 241.
Joh. Georg. Herwart and Ecl. Chr.
Kepler interpret the Words of St. Luke C. 2. v. 2.
, thus; that the Genitive Case (...) joined with the Word (...), ought to be
taken in the Comparative Mood, and signifies as much as if it had been said,
that this Taxation was the first and was made before Quirinius or Cyrenius was
Governor or Prefect of Syria. But if this had been the Sense of St. Luke, he
would, questionless, have expressed it thus: (...), this being more agreeable
to the Style of this Evangelist. In my Opinion it is the safest way to
conclude, that either Cyrenius has been twice Governor of Syria, or that he
was sent at the time of the Nativity of our Savior on purpose into Syria with
full Power to regulate this Taxation; the Word (...) implying any superior
Power; and that Josephus did not make mention of it, because it came perhaps
never to his Knowledge.

. 3. This Character of the Nativity of Christ, H^w to reconcile the Synchronism
of the 15th year of Tiberius and the 30th of Christ.
which ought to be considered as one of the fundamental ones of this Epoch,
has met with dubious Interpretations: For some of them explain the Words of (a)
St. Luke thus: Jesus began to be thirty years of Age, etc. Whereas others would
have it, Jesus was about thirty years of Age, to wit, when he began his
Ministry. Of the first Opinion is Scaliger, who C. 3. v. 23 L. 3. Isag. Chron.
pretends to evince that Christ was then entering his 31st year of Age. But I am
rather inclined to believe that the Word (...) is made use of here in an
Eliptick Sense; and that it ought to be understood as relating to (...) or
(...), or the Ministry of Christ.

. 4. This vulgar Epoch of the Nativity of Whether the Vulgar Epecha of Christ^
be the true one.
Christ was not only made use of by the Christian Writers at the time of Beda,
but the same has also met with a Patron among the Modern Authors in the Person
of Henr. Harvil. a Franciscan Friar, but to no great Purpose, it being certain
that the same is repugnant to the true Computation of the time of Herod, and
the Synchronism of the 15th year of the Reign of Tiberius, and the 30th year of
the Age of our Savior, and several other Ecclesiastical Characters
beforementioned.

. 5. There is not the least Question but that Dionysius, surnamed Exiguus, a
Native of Scythia, Whether Dionysius Exiguus was the first Author of this
Epoch.
and a Roman Abbot, was the first Author of the Vulgar Era of the Nativity of
Christ about the Year 527; the Ancients accounting their Years before that
time, either from the Building of the City of Rome, from the Consuls, or the
Emperor Dioclesian, or from the first Indiction. See W. Langius L. 1. c 1. de
An Christi.
.

. 6. In the Roman Martyrology, published by the Conterning the Synchronism^
mentioned in the Roman Martyrology.
Authority of Pope Gregory XIII, and revised by the Command of Pope Urban VIII,
we find these following Words, which are every year on the 25th day of December
read in public: In the Year since the Creation of the World, when God created
Heaven and Earth 5199: And since the Deluge, in the 2957th; and the Birth of
Abraham in the 2015th year: From Moses, and the time of the Israelites leaving
of Egypt, in the 1510th: And from the time of David 's being anointed King, in
the 1032 d Year; In the 42 d annual Week of Daniel; In the 194th Olympiad: In
the 752 d Year since the Building of Rome; in the 42 d Year of the Reign of the
Emperor Oct. Augustus, when the whole World was blessed with Peace. In the 6th
Age of the World, Jesus Christ, Eternal God, and Son of the Eternal Father,
conceived from the Holy Ghost, 9 Months after his Conception was born in
Bethlehem of Judaea from the Virgin Mary. But the Roman Catholic Writers
themselves acknowledge the many Contradictions contained in the Synchronisms of
this Martyrology, as may be seen in Baronius and Dionysius Petavius; and may be
easily refuted out of several of the preceding Chapters.

. 7. There being neither the Day nor the The different Opinions concerning the
Month, and Day of the Nativity of Christ.
Month of the Nativity of Christ mentioned in the Holy Scripture, this has
given Occasion to several different Opinions. For (1.) there are not a few
(among whom is Tho. Lydiott) who maintains Christ to have been born in the
Spring, which Opinion was already embraced by some at the time of Clemens
Alexandrinus and Paulus, a Bishop of Middleburgh L. 19. c. 4.
, in his Treatise of the Day of the Passion of Christ, presented to the
Emperor Maximilian, pretends to fix the Day of the Nativity of Christ on the
25th of March, exactly at the time of the Vernal Aequinox. (2.) There are
others who affirm that our Savior was born in Autumn; which Opinion however
they pretend to prove by different Arguments: For Beroaldus calls to his Aid
the half Annual Week mentioned by Daniel C. 9.
, and the Sabbatick and Jubilean Years, and the Feasts of Expiation, which had
their Beginnings in Autumn; but Josephus Scaliger has recourse to the Levitical
Order instituted by David 1 Chr. c. 23, v. 27. c. 25. v. 7.
; from whence he deduces the time of the Ministry of Zacharias; and from thence
the Conception of John the Baptist, and consequently his Birth and the Nativity
of our Savior. (3.) Others are of Opinion that Christ was born on the 6th day
of January, which makes Scaliger in his Animadversions upon Eusebius affirm,
that the whole Christian Church in the East did at the time of Eusebius, and in
the preceding and next following Age believe that Christ was born on the 6th
day of January, and according to Col. 10.
Cassianus, the Egyptians did celebrate the Nativity of Christ on the same
day. Last of all, the most general Opinion is, that Christ was born on the 25th
day of December, which being maintained by many Learned Men, and among them, by
St. Chrysostom, is received in our Churches, and is most agreeable to my
Judgment.

CHAP. XLI. Of the Epoch of the Passion of Christ.
1. Christ suffered after he had for some time after his solemn Inauguration by
the Holy Ghost, described by C. 3.
St. Luke, taught upon Earth, both by his Words and Deeds; it being evident out
of the History of the Gospel, and especially out of the Parable of the
fruitless Fig Tree, mentioned by C. 13. v. 7.
St. Luke, that our Savior after the Beginning of his Ministry, was several
times present at the Solemnity of the Passover.

2. Christ suffered when Josephus Caiaphas was High Priest among the Jews, as
is manifest out of C. 11. v. 49.
St. John, C. 3. v. 2.
St. Luke; and C. 4. v. 6.
the Acts; which Dignity he enjoyed from the eighth Year of the Reign of
Tiberius, and from the 4741st year of the Jul. Period, till the 15th year of
the Reign of Tiberius, and the 4748th year of the Jul. Period, when, according
to Josephus L. 18. c. 3. 6. Antiq.
, he was deposed by Vitellius, and Jonathan the Son of Annas substituted in his
Place.

3. Christ suffered when Pilate was Prefect of Palaestine, according to the
Testimony of the Evangelists and L 18. c. 4.
Josephus. The first Founder of this Name, says Tacitus L. 15. Annal.
, was Christ, who under the Reign of Tiberius was put to Death by Pontius
Pilate, then Governor of Palaestina. But Pontius Pilate was 10 years Prefect
of Palaestina, to be counted backwards from the Death of Tiberius, to wit, from
the Year of the Jul. Period 4740, till the Year of the Julian Period 4750.
Vitcllius, says Josephus L. 18. c. 5. Antiq.
, having made his Friend Marcellus Governor of Judaea ordered Pilate to return
to Rome, to answer before Caesar concerning such Matters as were objected
against him by the Jews. Thus, after he had governed the Province for whole 10
years, being forced to submit to the Orders of Vitellius, he undertook a
Journey to Rome; but before he could reach the City, Tiberius died.

4. When Herod Antipas was Tetrarch of Galilee Luke 23. v. 6.
, who afterward, in the 4th year of the Reign of Caius, was banished, and
Agrippa was substituted in his Place. See Josephus L. 19. c. 7. Ant.
.

5. When the Full Moon of the Passover was coincident with the 6th Feria, and
when our Savior eat the Passover with his Disciples, See C. 19. v. 31.
St. John, C. 15. v. 42.
St. Mark, and C. 23. v. 56.
St. Luke.

6. In the same year that happened that notable Eclipse mentioned by the
Evangelist Mat. 27. v. 45. Luke 23. v. 45.
in the following Words: From the 6th Hour there was Darkness over all the
Land, unto the 9th Hour: And concerning which Eclipse Phlegon Trallianus has
left a remarkable Observation to Posterity: In the 4th Year, says he, of the
202d Olympiad, there happened the greatest Eclipse that ever was known before:
For on the 6th Hour, the Day was converted into Night; so that the Stars
appeared in the Firmament. There was likewise felt a great Earthquake in
Bithynia, which ruined the greatest part of the City of Nicea.

7. Christ suffered in the Month Nisan, which was the first in the
Ecclesiastical Year, and on the 14th day of the same Month, at the time of the
Full Moon; according to the Words of God Exodus 12. v. 2.
, This Month shall be unto you the Beginning of Months; it shall be the first
Month of the Year to you: Speak you unto all the Congregation of Israel,
saying, In the 10th day of this Month they shall take to them every Man a Lamb,
according to the House of their Fathers, a Lamb for an House: And you shall
keep it up till the 14th day of the same Month, and the whole Assembly of the
Congregation of Israel shall kill it in the Evening: And they shall take of the
Blood and strike it on the two Side-Posts, and on the upper Door-Post of the
Houses, wherein they shall eat it: And they shall eat the Flesh in that Night
roast with Fire, and Unleavened Bread; and with bitter Herbs they shall eat it.
Of this same Feast of the Passover, L. 3. de Vit. Mos.
Philo has these following Words: On the fourteenth day of the same Month, when
the Moon is at the Full, the Jews celebrate their public Feast of the
Passover, which the Chaldaeans call Pascha.

From these Characters those who adhere to the Opinion of Scaliger conclude
that our Savior did eat his last Passover ((...)) in the Year of the Julian
Period 4746, Cycl.. 14.. 15, on the 3 d day of April; and that on the same day,
according to the Jewish Computation) Christ suffered Death.

If therefore from any certain year of the Julian Period, How to find out any
year of these Epocha's.
4745 Years and 3 Months be subtracted, the Residue shows the year since the
Passion of Christ. And if the said 4745 Years and 3 Months be added to the
known Year of this Epoch, the Product will be correspondent to the Year of the
Julian Period.

. 1. THere are various Opinions concerning the Characters of this Epoch; but
those The various Opinions of the Fathers concerning this Epoch.
before alleged may be looked upon as the choicest; the Ecclesiastical
Characters alleged by the Ancient Fathers, being for the most part involved in
many Errors, and contradictory to themselves. The most of them are of Opinion,
that our Savior did not teach in public above one Year and some Months; and
that he was crucified in the 2d Year after his Baptism, which Opinion they
found upon the Prophecy of C. 61. v. 1.
Isaiah: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because the Lord has anointed me
to preach good Tidings unto the Meek; he had sent me to bind up the
Brokenhearted, to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the
Prison to them that are bound: To proclaim The ACCEPTABLE YEAR of the LORD, and
the Day of Vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourn. Which Prophecy is
applied to Christ by C. 4. v. 19.
St. Luke: So that many of the ancient Fathers have fixed the time of the Death
of our Savior in the 30th year of his Age, and in the 15th or 16th year of the
Reign of Tiberius, on the 25th day of March; which Opinion among the Modern
Authors, Ger. Diss. de Temp. Dom. Pass.
Joh. Vossius has likewise embraced. But as we shall have Occasion to show
hereafter, our Savior did celebrate more Passovers after the Beginning of his
public Ministry: Neither was the Paschal Full Moon coincident with the 6th
Feria in that Year, which is appointed by the Fathers for the Passion of
Christ: Neither is it agreeable to that remarkable Observation of the Eclipse
by Phlegon: Neither do these Fathers agree in their Opinions among themselves:
For Tertullian, Clem. Alexandrinus, Julius Africanus, Lactantius, and St.
Austin affirm, that Christ preached but one Year in public; whereas St. Jerome
allows two, Ignatius three, and Irenaeus more years; the last of them being of
Opinion that Christ was 50 years old when he suffered Death. From whence it
appears, that the Opinions of the Fathers concerning this Epoch is built upon
a very uncertain Foundation.

. 2. Among the Ancients, Beda; and the Moderns, Ger. Joh. Vossius have made use
of this Method How many Passovers Christ celebrated after the Beginning of his
Ministry.
to investigate the Year of the Passion of Christ from the Number of the
Passovers celebrated by him after the Beginning of his Ministry, though it be
evident that the last is invo^ved in the same Difficulties with the first; the
Chronologers differing as much in their Opinion, if not more, concerning the
last as the first. For First, there are some who allow of no more than one Year
and a few Months after his Baptism, as has been mentioned before. Secondly,
Some allow of three Passovers after the Baptism of our Savior, among whom is
Epiphanius, St. Hierom, Beda, Nich. de Lyra, Alphonsus Tostatus, Pererius,
Maldonatus, Calvinus, Musculus, Dionysius Petavius, and Helwigius. There are,
Thirdly, others who affirm that our Savior did celebrate four Passovers after
his Baptism. The first they pretend to prove out of the 2d Chapter, v. 13, 23.
of St. John; the second out of the 4th Chapter, v. 35. and the 5th Chapter, v.
1, of St. John; the third out of the 6th Chap. v. 4. and v. 2. of St. John; the
4th out of the 12th Chap. v. 1. of St. John, the 22d, Chap. v. 1. of St. Luke,
the 14th Chap. v. 1. of St. Mark, and the 26th Chap. v. 1. of St. Matthew: Of
which Opinion are Not. ad Joh. 5.
Corn. a Lapide, Baronius, Torniellus, Beza, Junius, Jansenius, Henr. P^ilippi,
Hugo Grotius, Franciscus Toletus, Joh. Wic^mannus, and most of the Dutch
Interpreters. Fourthly, Scaliger, Calvisius, Helvicus, Calixtus, Wilhelm.
Langius, Causabonus, Deckerius, and Rob. Bailius, allot 5 Passovers after the
Baptism of Christ; and Jacobus Hainlinus, who makes the Interval betwixt the
Baptism and Passion of Christ to consist of 5 years and a half, does likewise
allow 5 Passovers after his Baptism. Among these different Opinions, we adhere,
as we have done frequently before, to that of Scaliger. But the Difficulty is
how to prove this 5th Passover out of the Holy Scripture, which has been
attempted by some, by comparing Chap. 12. v. 1. of St. Matthew, with the 6th
Chap. v. 1. and sequ. of St. Luke; Also by comparing the 9th Chap. v. 51. of
St. Luke, with his 10th Chap. v. 8. and 38. But it is our Opinion that we need
not be so very anxious in finding out the 5th Passover in the Holy Scripture;
since, though the same be not expressly mentioned, yet no Inference is to be drawn
from thence, that the same may be proved from other undeniable Circumstances.

. 3. Alphonsus, Tostatus, Fran. Toletus, Corn. a Christ did not celebrate the
last Passover with the Je^^.
Lapide, Baronius, Henr. Broughton, Joh. Cloppenburgius, and several others,
are of Opinion that our Savior did celebrate the last Passover with the Jews;
but against all Reason, as has been allowed by Causabonus. For the Day of the
Passion of Christ on which our Savior did likewise eat the Passover, is
expressly called Joh. c. 19. v. 14.
(...), the Preparation of the Passover; and Supper being ended, C. 13. v. 1.
(...), before the Feast of the Passover he washed the Feet of his Disciples.
And the Reason why the Jews would not enter the Judgment-Hall, was C. 18. v. 28.
(...), that they might eat the Passover. And there is but little likelihood
that the Pharisees, who were so very superstitious in observing all the nicest
Points of the Ceremonial Law, would have profaned this Feast by the Accusation
of Christ, when the pious Women were so scrupulous as not to dare to buy Spices
and Ointments. See St. C. 16. v. 1.
Mark and St. C. 14. v. 42.
John.

. 4. There is a great Dispute, which is not Whether Christ did celebrate the
Passover on the 14th day of the Month.
easily decided among the Interpreters, whether Christ eat the last Passover on
the 14th day of the first Month, according to the Institution of the Law, or
whether he celebrated it before the Full Moon. Those who adhere to the Greek
Church are of Opinion that Christ did celebrate the last Passover (...): But
when we consider that Christ subjected himself to the Law, this Opinion carries
along with it but little Probability. Besides that, the Words of Christ to his
Mat. 26. v. 17. Mar. 14. v. 2.
Apostles sufficiently imply the time of the Passover; and how can it be
supposed that those who let not slip the least Opportunity of slandering our
Savior, should have passed by in Silence such a Trespass against the Law. Hugo
Grotius makes a Distinction betwixt (...) and (...); The first, he says, was
celebrated at Jerusalem, according to the Institution of the Law, at a certain
prefixed time, when the Paschal Lambs were killed only by the Priests and
Levites. The second, he says, was the same which is to this day celebrated by
the Jews in other Parts, where they only eat Unleavened Bread with a few bitter
Herbs; and this he supposes was the same celebrated by our Savior before his
Passion. But it is absolutely false, that according to God's Institution, the
Priests alone were to kill the Paschal Lamb, as may be seen in C. 12.
Exodus and C. 23.
Leviticus; and the contrary is testified by L. 2. c. 5. Ant.
Josephus and L. 3. vit. Mos.
Philo, with whom agree Lorinus the Jesuit, Corn. a Lapide, Dorsheu^ and Will.
Langius. And it is worth Observation, that Christ did not command his Disciples
to prepare only Unleavened Bread with bitter Herbs: but several times makes
mention of the Paschal Lamb: And, acording to Syn. Jud. c. 12, 13, 14.
Joh. Buxtorfius, when the Jews celebrate the (...) they never eat the Paschal
Lamb, neither in ancient nor our Times To resolve in some measure this
Difficulty, it seems, that pursuant to the ancient Traditions of the Rabbi's,
the Pharisees, who closely adhered to them, never celebrated the Passover on
the 2d, 4th, and 6th Feria, notwithstanding that the Moon was at the Full. But
on the other hand, such among the Jews as were not so much addicted to these
Traditions, did eat the Passover at the time of the Paschal Plenilune. So that
our Savior celebrated the Passover with his Disciples at the time of the Full
Moon, in the first Month, which was in that Year on the 6th Feria; whereas the
Pharisees, pursuant to their Traditions, did not eat it till on the 7th Feria;
but durst not object any thing of this nature to our Savior, for fear of
disobliging such as celebrated the same Passover on the 6th Feria. I am not
ignorant that there are not a few among the Learned, among whom is Ger. Joh.
Vossius, who are of Opinion that this Translation of the Feasts is not so
ancient: But, that this Translation of the Feasts is of a very ancient
Offspring among the Jews, is sufficiently shown by Scaliger, Is. Causabonus,
Sebastianus Munsterius, Corn. Jansenius, Joh. Mariana, and Paulus
Middleburgensis, out of the Fragments of Gamaliel and other most ancient
Monuments. And it is beyond all Reason what is alleged by Vossius, to wit,
that the 14th day of the Month could fall out before the Aequinox; it being
unquestionable, that, according to the Jewish Calendary, the N. Moon of the
first Month was always next preceding the Vernal Aequinox. Scaliger and
Schimidius come much nearer to the Point, when they assert, that some among the
Jews following their ancient Traditions, used to transfer the Feast of the
Passover from the 14th Day of the first Month to the next following Sabbath.

. 5. It is evident, both from the Words of Who was High Priest among the Jews
at the time of the Passion of Christ.
the Holy Scripture, and the Testimony of Josephus, that Caiaphas was
High Priest at the time of the Passion of Christ. The only Objection is taken
from the 3d Chapter, ver. 2. of St. Luke, where it is said Annas and Caiphas
being the Highpriests, the Word of God came unto John. See the C. 4. v. 6.
Acts: Which Objection is sufficiently answered by Prol. in Eusebius.
Scaliger; to wit, that Annas was not actually High Priest at that time, but
only his Vicar to supply his Place upon any emergent Occasion. Others will have
it, that the Dignity of the High-Pontiff being for Life, they always retained
the Name though they were deposed, as Annas was who was mentioned here, in the
first place by reason of his great Authority, as having been High Priest
himself, and seen both his own Son and Son-in-Law in the same eminent Station.

. 6. The miraculous Eclipse which happened at the time of the Passion of Christ,
was both Whether that Eclipse which happened at the time of the Passion of Christ
was supernatural and universal.
supernatural and universal: Supernatural, because it happened in the Full Moon;
it being evident, that since the Solar Eclipses are caused by the Interposition
of the Moon betwixt the Sun and the Eyes of the Beholders, the same could not
happen according to the ordinary Course of Nature: Universal, according to the
Words of the Evangelists St. C. 27. v. 45.
Matthew and St. C. 23. v. 44.
Luke, which is likewise confirmed by the Dialogue betwixt Dionysius and
Apollophanes recited by Suidas in his Lexicon upon the Word Dionysius; where,
among other things, Dionysius answered Apollophanes concerning this Eclipse:
Aut Deus patitur, aut vicem Patientis deflet; Either God himself suffers, or
else is extremely concerned about him that suffers: Which contradicts the
Opinions of Origenes, Laur. Valla, Erasmus Roterdamus, and Is. Peyrerius, who
maintain that this was only a particular Eclipse which was not observed at
Athens, or any other Place beyond the Horizon of Jerusalem. And the Authority
and Testimony of Phlegon makes it one of the most unquestionable Characters of
the time of the Passion of Christ.

. 7. Christ suffered on the 6th Feria; For the Christ suffered on the 6th Feria.
Day on which Christ was crucified, is called by C. 15. v. 42.
St. Mark and C. 19. v. 31.
St. John (...); which is Preparation, or the Day before the Sabbath. 2. It is
said, that the Women staid but one Day before they came to the Sepulcher. See
St. Luke, c. 23. 3. The Syrian and Arabic Interpreters unanimously agree that
Christ suffered on the Friday; as 4. do the most ancient Fathers and
Ecclesiastical Writers. 5. It is confirmed by the Calculation of the Paschal
Plenilune, which was coincident with the 33d Year of Christ, which Plenilune
did happen that same Year on the 6th Feria. All which sufficiently contradicts
the Assertion of Paulus Middleburgensis and Willhelmus Langius, that Christ
suffered on the 5th Feria, or on Thursday. What they allege for themselves,
that it is said in C. 12. v. 40.
Matthew, That the Son of Man shall be three Days and three Nights in the Heart
of the Earth, some compute from the first Beginning of Christ's Passion; others
interpret it by three (...), containing two Nights and one Day.

CHAP. XLII. Of the Epoch of the last Destruction of the City of Jerusalem.
For the better understanding of this Epoch, these following Chararacters
ought to be taken into Consideration. 1. The Jewish War (in the fourth Year of
which Jerusalem was taken) began in the second year after Florus was made
Governor of that Province; and in the 12th year of the Reign of Nero. See Lib.
20. c. ult. Ant.
Josephus. The Jews bore it patiently, says L. 5. Histor.
Tacitus, till the time when Gessius Florus was made Governor; then the War
began to break out, when Cestius Gallus, then Deputy Governor of Syria
endeavoring to force them to a Compliance, they were vanquished in several
Engagements. 2. This Destruction of Jerusalem happened at the time of the
Expiration of the 70 Angelical Weeks, which, according to the Words of the
Prophet C. 9. v. 24.
Daniel were determined upon the People and the Holy City. 3. This Destruction
of Jerusalem happened in the 2 d year of the Reign of Flavius Vespafianus,
according to L. 6. c. 47. de bell. Jud.
Josephus and In Chron.
Eusebius. The Reign of Vespafian commences with the first day of July (when
Tiberius Alexander, then Governor of Egypt, first induced the Legions to
swear Fealty to Vespafian) in the 2 d year after the Death of Nero: For
(according to L. 66.
Dio Cassius, there was an Interval of a whole Year and 22 Days betwixt the
Death of Nero and the Beginning of the Reign of Vespasian) I say, in the same
Year when the Battle was fought near Cremona, and Vitellius was slain on the
day of the Feast of Saturn. See L. 3.
Tacitus: And about which time happened a notable Eclipse of the Moon, which
contributed not a little toward increasing the Tumult and Mutiny in Vitellius
's Army. See L. 65.
Dio. Such an Eclipse happened in the Year of the Vulgar Era of Christ 69, on
the 18th day of October, as may be easily investigated by the Astronomical
Calculations. 4. It was the 2 d Year of the 212th Olympiad when the Romans made
themselves Masters of the City of Jerusalem. See In Chron.
Eusebius. 5. The Destruction of Jerusalem happened in the same year that Fl. Vesp.
Augustus a second time, and Titus were Roman Consuls. See L. 66.
Dio Cassius. 6. It was the 331st Year before the Consulship of Stilico and
Aurelianus, when the City of Jerusalem was taken by the Romans. See Sulpit.
Severus. 7. Titus began the Siege of Jerusalem on the first day of the
Unleavened Bread, on the 14th day of the Month Xanticus, on the same day that
the Jews were freed from the Egyptian Bondage. See L. 5. C. 11. de Bell. Jud.
Josephus. 8. The Temple was laid in Ashes on the 10th day of the Month Lous,
on the same Day that the Temple was destroyed by Fire by the King of Babylon.
See L. 7. c. 9, 10.
Josephus and Seder Olam. 9. The City was taken on the 8th day of the Month
Gorpiaeus, and upon a Saturday, which Day is in great Veneration among the Jews
to this Day. See Josephus and L. 66.
Dio Cassius.


From these Characters it is evident that Titus began the Siege of Jerusalem in
the Year of the Julian Period 4783, Cycl.. 23.. 14. on the 14th day of April;
and that the Temple was laid in Ashes on the 6th day of August in the same
Year; and the total Desolation of the City on the first of September.

If therefore from any certain Year of the Julian Period be subtracted 4782
Years and 3 Months, Any certain year given of the Julian Period to find out the
year since the beginning of this Epoch.
or 7 Months, or 8 Months, the Residue shows the Year since the beginning of
the Siege of Jerusalem, and the Destruction of the Temple and City. On the
other hand, if to the known Years of this Epoch the beforementioned Sum of
Years and Months be added, the Product will be correspondent to the Year of the
Julian Period.

. 1. THE true Chronology of the Destruction Where we must look for the
Chronology of this Epoch.
of Jerusalem must chiefly be looked for in the Books of Josephus, he having
been at the same time a Prisoner in the Roman Camp, and employed by them as a
Messenger to the Besieged. And though the Jewish Rabbi's, but especially Rabbi
Isaac Abarbinel, do exclaim against his Authority, yet their Calumnies are of
little Consequence against so great an Historian, it being certain that the
Rabbi's themselves are Ignorant as to the true time of the Destruction of their
City, as we shall have Occasion to show immediately.

. 2. The Rabbi's in their Chronological Treatises Concerning the Jewish
Computation of this Epoch.
relate this Destruction in the following Words; especially in their Great
Chronicle: From the time of the War of Vespasian, till the War of Titus, are 24
Years: From the time of the War of Titus, till the War with Barcozbe 16 Years.
Thus, according to Rabbi Jose, the days of good Works and Sins, return within
one another. As for Example, the first Temple was destroyed on the Eve of the
Sabbath, toward the latter end of the 7th Year; and it was likewise in the
Week of the Station of Joarib, and the 9th day of the Month Ab. In the same
Manner happened the 2 d Destruction. And at both times the Levites were singing
the Canticle; And what Canticle? God our Lord will return upon their Heads
their Iniquity, and destroy them in their Malice, etc. In the other
Chronological Treatise written by Rabbi David Ganz, they indeed own that
Expedition of Fl. Vespasian and Tit. Vespasian to have been the same; but at
the same time relate Matters in a very different manner concerning Josephus,
and the Destruction of the Temple to the 3828th Year after the Creation, and
the 420th Year after its first Foundation. All which is a convincing Argument
of the Ignorance of the Jews in relation to their own History, and the
Destruction of their City.

. 3. We have already said in the foregoing Concerning the Computation of the
Fathers of this Epoch.
Chapter, that the Fathers have too much contracted that Interval betwixt the
time of the Baptism and Passion of Christ, from whence it is evident that their
Computations of the Interval betwixt the Passion of Christ and the Destruction
of Jerusalem being built upon an erroneous Hypothesis, no great Account is to
be made upon their Opinions in this Point.

. 4. De ^su Tab. p. 59.
Joh. Jac. Hainlinus is of Opinion, that Whether the Destruction of the City
happened in the 71st year of Christ.
the Destruction of the City of Jerusalem happened in the 71st year of Christ,
and in the 4784th year of the Jul. Period; But this Opinion being founded upon
the Fictitious Hypothesis of his Mystical Years, is directly repugnant to the
Ancient History: Neither is it possible to find out an Expedient to make the
Month of September of the 71st year of Christ coincident with the 2d year of
the Reign of Vespasian, as our Author would willingly persuade the World.

. 5. It is a very difficult Task to explain What Months are understood by
Josephus in his Relation of the Destruction of Jerusalem.
the Foreign Names of the Months mentioned by Josephus in his Relation of the
Destruction of Jerusalem: For in his 6th Book Chapter 4. De Bell. Jud.
he says, the Siege began on the 14th day of the Month Xanticus: And in the
same Book, in the 8th Chapter, he says, that the Romans made themselves Masters
of the first Wall on the 5th day of the Month Artemisius. Thus he frequently
makes mention of the Month Lous, and refers the total Desolation of the City to
the 8th day of the Month Gorpiaeus. It is beyond all dispute, that Josephus had
borrowed these Names from the Macedonians, who being subdued by the Romans, had
been forced to change their Ancient Lunar Calendar for the Solar of the Romans.
The Macedonian Months do thus correspond with the Julian:

Audinaeus, January. Peritius, February. Dystius, March. Xanthicus, April.
Artemisius, May. Daesius, June. Panemus, July. Lous, August. Gorpiaeus,
September. Hyperberetaeus, October. Dius, November. Apellaeus, December.

But whether Josephus by the Names of these Macedonian Months did understand
them according to the Julian Months, is a great Question: Ruffinus, Josephus
Scaliger, Calvisius, Archbishop Usher, and many others, are of this Opinion:
But for my part, I am rather inclined to believe that Josephus by these
Macedonian Names did understand the Jewish Months. For it is expressly said by
Josephus, that his Countrymen did go out of Egypt on the same 14th day of the
Month Xanthicus when Titus began to invest the City of Jerusalem; and it being
unquestionable that this was the 14th of the Month Nisan, there is but little
Probability that Josephus intended to make this day of the Month Nisan
correspondent with a certain Day of the Julian Calendar: And the Characters of
the Epoch of the Departure of the Jews out of Egypt showing most evidently
that the Jews did depart out of Egypt, not on the 14th but 16th day of April,
we may rationally conclude, that Josephus did by the Month Xanthious understand
the Month Nisan; on the 14th day of which Month the Feast of the Passover was
constantly kept by the Jews. Secondly, it is not very probable that the Jews
should refer the Day of the first Destruction of their Temple to any certain
Day of the Julian Calendar, which was not as much as thought of at that time,
it being mentioned by Josephus, that on the 10th day of the Month Lous likewise
the first Temple was destroyed by Fire. I see no Reason why by the Month Lous
should not be understood the Month called AB by the Ancient Jews. Thus the
Words of the Prophet Jeremiah C. 52. v. 12.
may be reconciled with the Relation of Josephus: In the Month, says the
Prophet, on the 10th day of the Month (AB) which was the 19th year of
Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan Captain of the Guard, which
served the King of Babylon into Jerusalem, and burned the House of the Lord,
etc.

According to this Hypothesis the Months are as follows:

Xanthicus, Nisan. Artemisius, Giar. Daesius, Sivan. Panemus, Tamutz. Lous, Ab.
Gorpiaeus, Elul. Hyperberetaeus, Tisri. Dius, Marchesvan. Apellaeus, Casleu.
Audinaeus, Tebeth. Peritius, Schebath. Dystius, Adar.

. 6. It is commonly supposed, that Jerusalem How often Jerusalem was taken.
was taken but twice; and that not altogether without Reason, if it be
understood in reference of its total Destruction. Nevertheless L. 8. c. 18. de
Bell. Jud.
Josephus affirms that it was taken five several times before it was destroyed
by Titus. Jerusalem, says he, was taken five times before; By Asoch the
Egyptian King, and after him by Antiochus, then by Pompey, and after these by
Herod and Sosias, who preserved the City: But before that time, the King of
Babylon had laid it quite desolate. Which sufficiently contradicts that
Vainglorious Inscription mentioned by Inscr. Ant. fol. 154.
Justus Lipsius, which is as follows:

IMP. TITO. CAESARI DIVI VESPASIANI. F. VESPASIANO. AUG. PONTIFICI. MAXIMO.

called the second Temple: For though, according to L. 15. c. 14. Ant.
Josephus, Herod did demolish the Temple, and built a new one instead of it;
yet this being done only with an Intention to render the Structure of the
Temple the more Magnificent; and having no relation to its interior Parts, is
therefore not called the 3d, but the 2d Temple.

confirmed by In Chron.
Eusebius, L. 7. c. 6.
Orosius, and Sulpitius Severus: But J. Lipsius has computed the whole Number
of the Jews slain and taken Prisoners in their Civil and Foreign Wars within
the space of the last 7 Years in the following manner:

At Jerusalem by the Command of Florus, 630 At Caesarea by the Inhabitants,
20000 At Scythopolis, 13000 In Askalon, 2500 At Ptolemais, 2000 At Alexandria,
50000 At Damascus, 10000 At the taking of Joppa, 8400 In the Mount Cubulon,
2000 In the Battle near Ascalon, 10000 By Surprise, 8000 At Aphac, 15000 In the

Massada, 960 At Cyrene, 3000 During the Siege of Jerusalem, 1000000 made
Prisoners, 97000 The whole Number, 1339690

. 9. According to the Latin Version of the Whether the Kingdom of the Jews
^^ased with the Destruction of Jerusalem.
Chronicon of Eusebius translated by St. Hierome, and the Chronicle of the
beforementioned Rabbi David Ganz, the Royal Dignity was quite abolished among
the Jews at the time of the last Destruction of the Temple; which is
contradicted by Scaliger, who demonstrates by a certain Coin with this
Inscription, Post captam Judaeam adhuc erat (...), that Agrippa did not die in
the 3d Year of the 212th Olympiad. We agree thus far with Scaliger, That
Agrippa did retain the Royal Title after the Destruction of Jerusalem; of which
Photius in Cod. 33.
(...), has these following Words: The Chronicle of Justus Tiberiensis was
read, which had for its Title THE HISTORY OF JUSTUS TIBERIENSIS OF ALL SUCH AS
WERE CROWNED KINGS OF THE JEWS. This Author was a Native of Tiberias, a City in
Galilee, which has given him his Surname. He begins his History with Moses,
which he continues till the Death of Agrippa, the 7th King of the Family of
Herod, and the last of the Jewish Kings. He received the Crown under the Reign
of Claudius; his Power increased by Nero, and became more potent under
Vespasian. He died in the third Year of the Reign of Trajan, with which Year he
concludes his History. But it is very evident out of several Passages in
Josephus, that Agrippa was neither King of the Jews nor Jerusalem: For he
allows him not the least Authority over Judaea, unless what concerned the L.
20. c. 8. Ant.
Temple; but says, L. 20. c. 3, 5.
that by the Favor of Claudius he was put in the Possession of the Kingdom of
Chalcis, and by Nero regaled with the Cities of Tiberias, Tarichaea and Julia,
with 14 other Towns of less Note: And that the whole Judaea, the greatest part
of Galilee and Samaria, was under the Jurisdiction of the Roman Praefects, is,
according to the Testimony of Josephus, past all Dispute.

CHAP. XLIII. Of the Epoch of Dioclesian, which is commonly called by the
Egyptians the ERA OF MARTYRS, by Eusebius the ERA (...), or of Persecution,
by the Aethiopians the ERA OF GRACE, and by the Mahometans the ERA ELKUPTI.
1. The Era of Dioclesian begins in the same Year that Dioclesian, after the
Death of Carus and Numerianus, was declared Emperor. 2. The Emperor
Dioclesian entered Nicomedia in Triumph on the 15th day of September, and the
first of January following appeared in public as Consul. 3. About that time
Carinus the 2 d time, and Numerianus were Roman Consuls, who were succeeded by
Dioclesian (already declared Augustus) and Aristobulus. This is not only thus
related in the Chronicon Alexandrinum, but also by Lib. 23.
Ammianus Marcellinus, who says expressly that when Dioclesian was Consul with
Aristobulus, he was dignified with the Title of Augustus. And thus we find it
recorded in the Public Records called Fasti Capitolini, IMP. CAES. C. AVRELIO
DIOCLESIANO AVG. II..... ARISTOBVLVS. 4. The 3 d Indiction then began with the
Month of September, according to the Chronicon Alexandrinum. 5. The first year
of the Reign of Dioclesian is coincident with the 2301st year of the Epoch of
Abraham; unto which if 2696 years be added, the Product shows the year of the
Julian Period, as has been demonstrated before, according to Eusebius. in Chron.
6. In the 89th year since the Beginning of the Reign of Dioclesian, says L. 10.
Ep. 83. ad Epiph.
St. Ambrose, the Full Moon falling then out upon the 21st day of March, we did
celebrate Easter upon the last day of March. Those of Alexandria and other
Places in Egypt, the Full Moon happening with them on the 28th day of the
Month Phamenoth, did celebrate their Easter on the 5th day of the Month
Pharmuth, which was, like among us, the last day of March. Again, in the 93d
year since the Beginning of the Reign of Dioclesian, it being then Full Moon,
on the 14th day of the Month Pharmuth, and Sunday, they celebrated Easter on
the next following 21st day of the same Month, which, according to our
Calendar, is the 14th day of April. 7. The 92 d year since the Beginning of the
Reign of Dioclesian is coincident with the 12th year of the Reign of
Valentinian and Valens, and the 8th of Gratian. 8. It was in the 248th year
since the Beginning of the Reign of this Tyrant, when Dionysius, surnamed
Exiguus, first began his Paschal Cycle, according to Dionysius Exiguus himself
in his first Epistle, mentioned by Append. de Doct. Temp.
Dionysius Petavius. Consult also C. 45. de Rat. Temp.
Beda. 9. The Egyptians began the Years of the Era of DioclesianI with the
Month Thot, being our 29th day of August. 10. In the same Year that Dioclesian
a second time and Aristobulus, were Consuls at Rome, Carinus Margo was slain,
and Dioclesianus was exalted to the Empire. Thus says In East.
Idacius. 11. In the 19th year of the Reign of Dioclesian, in the Month
Dystius, (which is among the Romans the Month of March) Easter being near at
Hand, the Emperor caused a Proclamation to be published, that all the Churches
should be pulled down and laid level with the Ground; that all their Papers
should be burnt, and the Christians be deprived of all their Places and
Dignities; and that such among them as persevered in their Faith should be
accounted infamous and be made Slaves. Of which see Eusebius L. 8. c. 3. Hist.
Eccl.
, Metrophanes and Alexander in Cod. 256.
Photius; as likewise Ignatius the Patriarch of Antioch of which mention is
made by Scaliger L. 5. p. 49^. de Em. Temp.
. 12. In the same year, being the 19th of the Reign of Dioclesian, and the
first of the Persecution, Dioclesian was the 8th time, and Maximianus the 7th
time Roman Consuls, according to Idacius. 13. The year when Dioclesian began
the Persecution against the Christians, was coincident with the 351st year
since the Beginning of the Antiochian Epoch, according to Eusebius in Chron.
14. In the 2 d year of the Persecution Dioclesian did abdicate himself at
Nicomedia, and Maximin. at Milan. See L. 8. c. 8. Hist. Eccl.
Eus. Idac. Eurrop. 15. It was in the 3 d year of the Persecution raised
against the Christians by Domitian, when Constantius died, according to
Metrophanes and Alexander in Cod. 256.
Photius. But the time of the Death of Constantius is thus expressed by L. 1.
c. 1.
Socrates: Constantius was proclaimed King in Britain instead of his Father
Constantius, in the first year of the 271st Olympiad, on the 25th day of July.
16. In the 4th year of the Persecution Constantine began his Reign, according
to Eusebius. in Chron. 17. In the 19th year of the Reign of Dioclesian, in the
Month of March, in Easter time, the Christian Churches were pulled down,
according to St. Hierom in Chron. Eusebius.
From these, and innumerable other Characters, too many to be inserted here, it
is evident, that Dioclesian was declared Augustus in the year of the Julian
Period 4997, Cycl. 13.. 19. on the 17th day of September; and that the
Egyptians began this Era on the 29th day of August; and that the Persecution
against the Christians began in the year of the Julian Period 5016, Cycl.. 4..
19. in the Month of March.

If therefore 4996 years and 8 Months be subtracted How to find out any year of
these Epocha's.
from any certain year of the Julian. Period, the Residue shows the year since
the beginning of the Era of Dioclesian: And if in the same manner 5015 Years
and 3 Months be subtracted, the Residue will be correspondent to the year since
the Beginning of the Persecation raised by Dioclesian against the Christians.
But if you desire to investigate the Year of the Julian Period, you must add
the abovementioned Number of Years and Months to the known Year of these
Epocha's.

. 1. L. 5. de Em. Temp. p. 494.
SCaliger is of Opinion that this Epoch Whether this Epoch begins with the
Reign of Dioclesian.
began three years or more before Dioclesian was declared Emperor and
Augustus; but in my Opinion, he has been misguided in this Point by Aurel.
Cassiodorus, who has confounded in so miserable a manner the Years of the Reign
of Dioclesian, that there is not the least Reason to follow his Footsteps.

. 2. The Ancients were for the most part of this Opinion, that the Epoch of
Dioclesian had Whether the Ancients began this Epoch from the time of the
Persecution.
its Beginning from the time of the Persecution raised by this Tyrant against
the Christians, as may be seen out of the L. 5. p. ^^6. de Em. Temp.
Epistle of Ignatius the Patriarch of Antiochia written to Scaliger upon this
Account; You are also, says he, very desirous to be informed concerning the
ERA of MARTYRS used among the Egyptians, its true Origin and Denomination:
You must know then that it has its Beginning from the 19th Year of the Reign of
that impious ((...)) King Dioclesian; at which time he raised the most Violent
Persecution against the Christians, ordering their Churches to be demolished;
and that such as refused to pay Adoration to the Idols, should be killed.
Pursuant to this Edict, there were alone in Egypt one hundred and forty four
thousand and seven hundred Believers sacrificed to his Fury: From which time
began the ERA ELKUPTI, or the ERA of MARTYRS, whose Blood was shed by
Dioclesian. But it is apparent that this Patriarch is under a Mistake; and that
he has confounded the Year of the Beginning of his Reign with that of his
Persecution against the Christians. And it is not altogether improbable, but
that the Egyptians, to abolish the Memory of this Tyrant, have changed this
Epoch, which had borrowed its Name from Dioclesian into that of the MARTYRS.

. 3. There is no great Difficulty in finding The Congruity betwixt the Months
of this Epoch and the Julian Months.
out the Congruity there is betwixt the Months of this Epoch and the Julian
Months, if it be taken into Consideration that the Years of the Era of
Dioclesian, or of the MARTYRS, both in respect of their Quantity and the Order
of the Bissextiles or Leap-Years, agree for the most part with the Julian
Years: For they do, like us, intercalate a Day at certain times. The whole
Difference lies in the Quantity of the Months and the Beginning of the Year:
For the Egyptians have made their Months all (...), and begin their Year with
the 29th day of August, adding to the common Year, after the Month Mesori, five
Epagomena's; and to the Leap-Year six Epagomena's. The ^ollowing Table shows
the true Connection betwixt ours and the Egyptian Months.

1. Constantine the Great was immediately after the Death of his Father
Constantius Chlorus, both by his Testament and the Approbation of the Soldiery
proclaimed Caesar. L. 1. de Vit. Constable. M.
Eusebius. 2. Constantius Chlorus died on the 23 d day of July, when
Constantius Caesar and Maximianus Jovius were both the 6th time Roman Consuls,
at the time of the 10th Indiction. See Chron. Alexandrinus, Idacius, and L. 1.
c. 1.
Socrates. 3. The first Year of Constantine the Great i^ coincident with the
4th Year of the 10th Persecution raised by Dioclesian against the Christians.
Hieron. in Chron. 4. This Persecution began in the Year of the Antiochian Era
351, in the 19th year of the Reign of Dioclesian, when Dioclesian Augustus was
the 8th time and Maximianus Herculius the 7th time Roman Consuls. See Chron.
Alex.
Eusebius. 5. The Year in which the Tyrant Maxentius was vanquished was the 6th
year after the Death of Constantius Chlorus, and likewise of the Reigns of
Maxentius and Constantine the Great. Maxentius, says the Panegyrist, speaking
to Constantine the Great, having squandered away whole six years in Idleness,
made his Birthday remarkable by his Death, that the Tyranr might not defile
that Sacred and Religious Septenary Number, by entering into the 7th Year of his
Reign. 6. The Tyrant Maxentius was slain when Constantine and Licinius were
both the 2 d time Roman Consuis, in the 4th Year of the 272 d Olympiad,
according to St. Hierome; toward the latter End of Autumn, says Nazarius, at
the Beginning of the Winter (about the Month of October) in the Year of Christ
312. 7. At the time of the Decennalia of Constantine the Great, that is to say,
in the 7th Year of his Reign, he appointed his Son Constantine surnamed Junior,
Caesar; according to L. 4. c. 40. de Vit. Constable.
Eusebius; and the Chron. Alexandrinum mentions that it happened in the Year of
Christ 316, when Sabinus and Ruffinus were Roman Consuls. 8. The same Year that
the Council of Nicaea was finished, was coincident with the Year when
Constantine the Great celebrated the Vicennalia, being the Beginning of the
21st Year of his Reign. See L. 3. c. 14. L. 4. c. 47. de Vit. Constable.
Eusebius. L. 1. c. 12.
Socrates, L. 1. c. 24.
Sozomenus, and Ishmael Ibn Ali a Mohammedan Writer by L. 1. p. 102. de Ann. Chr.
Langius. 9. Concerning the time of the Council of Nicaea, (says L. 1. c. 9.
Socrates) it was called together, as may be seen in the Annals on the 22d day
of May, when Paulinus and Julianus were Roman Consuls, in the 636th Year after
the Reign of Alexander the Great, since the Beginning of the Era of the
Seleucides. And the Edicts published by Constantine the Great show these
Characters to direct us to the 325th Year of Christ. 10. The Council of Nicaea
did not last much above one Year; and according to In Annal.
Eutychius, all the Bishops were met in the City of Nicaea, within the Space of
one Year and two Months. 11. The beforementioned Vicennalia are said to have
been celebrated by Constantine the Great in the 2 d Year of the 276th Olympiad,
when Constantine was the 7th time and Constantius Roman Consuls, in the Year of
Christ 326. See Eus. in Chron. Fast. Sic. 12. In the 30th Year of Constantine
the Great, when Dalmatius was proclaimed Caesar, Constantius the 6th time and
Albinus were Roman Consuls, according to St. Chron. Alexandr.
Jerome. 13. Constantine the Great died on the 20th day of May, being then
Witsunday, according to Lib. 4. c. 53. and 64. in Vit. Constant.
Eusebius and the Chron. Alexandrinum, when Felicianus and Titianus were Roman
Consuls. Consult Sozomen, Chron. Alexandrinum, and Hist. Tripart.
Idacins. In the fourth Year of the 278th Olympiad, at the Age of 65 Years. See
Chron. Alexandr. 14. From the Death of Constantine the Great, to count
backwards to the Beginning of his Reign, are computed about 31 Years, according
to L. 1. c. 12.
Socrates; 30 Years and 10 Months, according to Idacius and In Chr.
St. Jerome; 30 Years, 9 Months and 27 Days, according to In Fast.
Onuphrius. 15. The 341st Year of Christ, when Marcellus and Probinus were
Roman Consuls, was coincident with the 5th Year after the Death of Constantine
the Great; and in the same Year was held the Council of Antiochia. See (q)
Socrates. L. 2. c. 5. Hist. Eccles.

From these Characters it is evident, First, That Constantius Chlorus died, and
was succeeded in the Empire by Constantine the Great in the Year of the Julian
Period 5019, Cycl.. 7.. 3. on the 25th day of July. Secondly, that Maxentius
was vanquished in the Year of the Julian Period, 5025, toward the latter End
of September. Thirdly, That the Council of Nicaea began in the Year of the
Julian Period 5038, on the 22 d day of May, and lasted till the Year of the
Julian Period 5039, in July; at which time Constantine the Great celebrated the
Vicennalia at Nicomedia, and in the next Year at Rome. Fourthly, That
Constantine the Great died in the year of the Julian Period 5050, on the 22 d
day of May.

If therefore from any certain year of the Julian Period given, be subtracted
5018 years and 7 To investigate the Years since the Beginning of these Epocha's.
Months, the Residue shows the year since the Death of Constantius Chlorus, and
the Beginning of the Reign of Constantine the Great: Likewise if you would
investigate the year since the Death of Maxentius, and the Propagation of the
Christian Doctrine throughout the whole Roman Empire, subtract from any known
year of the Julian Period 5024 Years and 9 Months. And for the time since the
Council of Nicaea, 5037 years and 5 Months; for the time since the Death of
Constantine the Great subtract 5049 years and 5 months, and the Residues will
be correspondent to the years of these several Synchronisms. But if to the
known years of these several times beforementioned, the abovenamed Numbers of
Years and Months be added, the Products will be correspondent to the several
years of the Julian Period.

. 1. In Eusebius. p. 226.
JOsephus Scaliger speaking of the Times of Constable. the Great, breaks out into
The History of Constantine the Great is very uncertain.
these Words: Nothing is more uncertain than the Beginnings of these Emperors,
from Carus to Valentinian. Ad An. Christi ^06. 16.
Baronius is so positive in his Assertion that Constable. the Great was not only
first proclaimed Caesar in Britain, but also was a Native of that Island, and
was elevated to the Imperial Dignity by his Countrymen, that he looks upon
those who pretend to contradict it little better than mad Men. Nevertheless L.
4. c. 11. de magn. Romans
Justus Lipsius, a Man of great Judgment, is of Opinion that this Emperor was
born at Tharsus a City of Bithynia: And there are not a few who affirm
according to L. 1. (...).
Constantius Porphyrogennetus and the Manuscript of Fermicus, that he was born
at Naisum a City of Dacia. But we will only allege the different Opinions of
the Chronologers: The Author of the Chron. Alexan. says that Constable. Chlorus
died at York when Constantius the 6th time and Maxim. Jovius were Roman
Consuls; with whom agrees In Fast.
Onuphrius, when speaking of the Year when FL. VALERIVS, CONSTANTIVS CHLORVS P.
F. AVG. VI. ET GALERIVS VALERIVS MAXIMIANVS P. F. AVG. VI. were Roman Consuls,
he says further thus:

EODEM ANNO A. D. ^I. KAL. AVGVSTI.

IMP. CAESAR CONSTANTIVS AVG. MORTVVS EST.

The Ancient Author of the Excerpta alleged by P. 69.
Scaliger, erroneously refers his Death to the Consulship of Licinius and
Crispus. The Year of these Consuls mentioned by us is coincident with the Year
since the Building of Rome 1058. But L. 7. c. 17.
Orosius says, that Constantine began his Reign in the Year 1061, since the
Building of Rome. We have proved before, that Constable. the Great was proclaimed
Caesar in the Year of Christ 306; which Opinion is approved of by Part 2. l. ^
c 11.
Petav. in Ration. Tempor. Nevertheless the same Petavius, in his Treatise de
Doct. Temp. deduces the Beginning of the Reign of Constable. the Great from the
305th Year of Christ, having read in the History of Socrates that Constable. the
Great died in the first Year of the 271st Olympiad, on the 25th day of July.
Scaliger affirms, that Constable. the Great was not proclaimed Caesar till the Year
of Christ 307. And L. 4. c. 53 de Vit. Constable.
Eusebius says expressly, that Constable. the Great reigned 31 Years and some
Months; with whom agrees the Author of the Chron. Alexand. and Joh. Monachus,
who allot 31 Years and 10 Months for the Reign of this Emperor. L. 2. n. xvii.
Philostorgius affirms that he reigned beyond the 32d Year. On the other hand,
St. Jerome, Eutropius, Onuphrius, and many more, who are of the same Opinion
with us, allow no more than 30 Years and 10 Months for the Reign of Constable. the
Great; and Scaliger but 29 Years and 10 Months. There is no less Dispute about
the Age of Constable. the Great. Eusebius says he was not quite 64 Years old when
he died, there wanting a few Months and Days. But Socrates, Sozomenus,
Ruffinus, Cassiodorus, and a great many others, affirm that Constable. the Great
died in the 66th Year of his Age. They are also no less divided in their
Opinions concerning those that were Consuls at Rome when Constable. the Great died.
Those who refer his Death to the Consulship of Felicianus and Titianus we have
cited before. But in the Consular Records published by Antonius Contius, we
find his Death coincident with the Consulship of Vrsus Lupulus and Polemius,
and consequently one Year later; and In Chron.
Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus with the Consulship of Constantius the 2d time,
and Constans, and consequently two Years later. And who is as much as able to
enumerate, much less to decide the different Opinions concerning the Reign of
Constable. the Great? Our beforementioned Characters are the surest Guides to
extricate us out of this Labyrinth.

. 2. Some of the Ancients were of Opinion, Whether Constantine was proclaimed
Caesar before his Father's Death.
that Constantine was proclaimed. Caesar before his Father's Death, which seems
to be confirmed by the Authority of Eusebius, when he allots 32 Years for the
Reign of this Emperor. And the Author of the Chron. Alexandr. says expressly,
that the Year of the Death of Constantius was the 2d Year of Constantine. And
In Chron.
Cassiodorus speaking of the Consulship of Dioclesian the 10th time, and
Maximus the 7th time, has the following Words: Constantius not troubling
himself with any Business, was contented with the Title of Augustus; which is
the Reason, that some years of his Reign are included in the Reign of his Son
Constantine, who, as it was reported, was born from Helen his Concubine, etc.

. 3. But though L. 1. c. 16. de Vit. Constable.
Eusebius. relates that Constantine was Whether Constantine was declared Emperor
and Augustus immediately after his Father's Death.
proclaimed Emperor and Augustus at the time of Constantius his Father's
Funeral: yet if we give Credit to the ancient Monuments of these Times, we must
conclude that Constantius either immediately after, or perhaps before his
Father Constantius's Death, was declared Caesar; but did not take upon him the
Titles of Imperator or Augustus till after his Marriage with Fl. Maximiana
Fausta, the Daughter of Maximianus Herculeus, as among others appears out of
the Oration of the Panegyrist, spoken in the Presence of Maximian and
Constantine Augustus; where among others, he has these Words: TIBI CAESARI
ADDITUM NOMEN IMPERII: And further, as follows; ET TIBI, CONSTANTINE, PER
SOCERUM NOMEN IMPERII ACCREVERIT, etc.

. 4. There is a Dispute among the Historians, Whether Constantine was the first
Christian Emperor.
whether Constable. the Great, or the Emperor Philip, surnamed Arabs, was the
first Christian Emperor. L. 5. c. 27. Hist. Eccl.
Eusebius affirms, that already in his time it was granted by many, that this
Philip had embraced the Christian Religion; and L. 7. c. 18.
Orosius says expressly, that this Philip was the first of all the Christian
Emperors; and that Constantine was the first Christian Emperor except Philip.
On the other hand, Eusebius seems to call in question the Christianity of
Philip; when he says, that among all the other Emperors, Constantine was the
only one who was initiated by the holy Baptism; with whom agrees in Opinion
Lactantius in his Preface; when he says, that he was the first of all the Roman
Princes who had laid aside his erroneous Opinion, and was come to the true
Knowledge of God; and relates of this Philip Arabs, that he was an Idolater.
Scaliger is of Opinion, that in Reality he was a Pagan, but pretended to be a
Christian for some Reasons of State: So that the best Chronologers agree in
this Point, that the Epoch of the Christian Emperors begins with the Reign of
Constable. the Great.

. 5. Augustus having refused to accept of the The Origin of the Decennalia and
Vicennalia.
Empire any otherwise than for the Space of ten Years, was the first who
instituted the Decennalia; concerning which L. 53.
Dio Cassius has these following Words: Caesar, to remove from himself all
Suspicion of being ambitious of the Royal Dignity, so odious to the Romans, but
much coveted by him; for which Reason he would accept of the Government of the
Provinces for 10 years, only, adding these Words; That if he could reduce them
to a State of Tranquillity in a less time, he would sooner abdicate the
Government.

. 6. There is also a great Question among the Historians how long the Council
of Nicaea lasted. Concerning the time of the Nicaean Council.
Scaliger is of Opinion that it was dissolved in the 3d Year after it was
called together; with whom agree L. 1. c. 1. de Council.
Bellarminus and Ad An. Chr. 338.
Genebrardus, but is contradicted by Baronius and Petavius. Those who disagree
with Scaliger, allege in their behalf the Words of Alexander and Metrophanes
in ^o^. 256.
Phot. which are as follows: The Council being ended after three years and a
half, for it began on the 15th day of April, and continued till three years
after, not only till the same Month of April, but till the September next
following; But I look upon it as unquestionable, that the End of the Council of
Nicaea ought to be made coincident with the Vicennalia of Constable. the Great.

CHAP. XLV. Of the Epoch and the Encoenia of NEW ROME, or the City of
Constantinople, and the Division of the Roman Empire into the Eastern and
Western Empire.
1. The first year of this Epoch is coincident with the 25th year of the Reign
of Constantine the Great, according to St. Jerome and Cedrenus. 2. The solemn
Consecration of this City was made in the Third Indiction, according to the
same Cedrenus. 3. When the second Feria did fall upon the 11th day of May,
according to the same Cedrenus, and the Anonymous Author of the Chron.
Alexandrinum cited by P. 284.
Scaliger. 4. In the year of the World, according to the Greek Computation,
5838. according to Zonaras, Cedrenus and Joh. Monachus. 5. In the 2 d year of
the 277th Olympiad. See Chron. Eus. Hieron. 6. In the 360th year since the
Reign of Augustus, according to Suidas. 7. When Gallicanus and Symmachus were
Roman Consuls, according to the Chronicon of Causabon cited by Scaliger. 8. At
the time of the 5th Indiction, Mavortius being then alone Consul at Rome, in
the 197th year after the Building of Constantinople, the Emperor Justinus did
appoint Justinianus, his Nephew, his Successor in the Empire, on the first day
of April, according to Comes Marcellinus.
From these Characters it is evident that the Encoenia, or Consecration of the
City of Constantinople did happen on the 11th day of May in the 5043 d year of
the Julian Period, Cycl.. 3.. 8.

If therefore from any certain year given of the Julian Period, be subtracted
5042 Years and 4 Any certain year given of the Julian Period to find out the
year since the beginning of this Epoch.
Months, the Residue shows the year since the Beginning of the Epoch of
Constantinople: And if the said Sum of 5042 Years and 4 Months be added to the
known Year of this Epoch, the Product will be correspondent to the Year of the
Julian Period.

. 1. THIS Epoch is scarce mentioned by some Chronologers; Nevertheless we
judged Why this Epoch is treated of in particular.
it not for our Purpose to pass it by in Silence: First, because the
Constantinopolitans always made a great Account of this Epoch, especially in
their public Records, as may be seen in L. 5. de Em. Temp.
Scaliger. And in the Imperial Laws of L. 7. de Feriis.
Valentinian and Theodofius, we read these following Words: Kalendarium quoque
Januarium consuetos dies otio mancipamus. His adjicimus NATALITIOS DIES VRBIVM
MAXIMARUM ROMAE atque CONSTANTINOPOLIS, in quibus debent jura differri, quia ab
ipsis nata sunt. Secondly, because this occasioned the greatest and most
pernicious Change in the Government of the Roman Empire. Thirdly, because by
this Innovation the Number of Patriarchs increasing, this gave Birth to great
and innumerable Contests among the Bishops. Consult C. 3. Annal.
Zonar. and G. Codinus.

. 2. Suidas in his Lexicon says, that the Ancients The Derivation of the Word
Encoenia.
by the Word Encoenia understood any public Solemnity, or rather Initiation:
In which Sense are taken the Encoenia of the Temple of Solomon, of the
Maccabaeans and Emperors. Among the Latins they were called Dedications or
Consecrations, being certain Days appointed to give Thanks to God Almighty on
the Account of something of Moment brought to a happy Conclusion, and to
implore him for the Continuance of his Mercies. Of these Consecrations consult
the C. 1. de Consecrationibus.
Jus Canonicum.

. 3. All the Historians agree in this Point, The Derivation of the Word
Byzantium.
that the City of Constantinople was founded by Constable. the Great upon the
Ruins of the ancient Byzantium; but they are of different Opinions concerning
the Origin of this Word. Most of them however agree in this, that Byzantium
received its Name from its Founder King Byzantes, or a famous Commander at Sea
called Buzes. Georgius has this following fabulous Tradition; That Byzantes was
Son of Neptune, and Cornuta the Daughter of Io, a Concubine of Jupiter; and
that he received his Name from the Nymph Bezia, who had educated him in Thrace.
This Byzantes, says Codinus, after he had made himself famous by his Exploits
among those inhabiting the Mountains of Thrace, founded the City of Byzantium.

. 4. The Oracle of Delphis had pronounced The Tradition of the Ancients
concerning the City of Byzantium.
the following Words concerning the City and Inhabitants of the Ancient
Byzantium: That the Inhabitants of that City, situate upon the Thracian Shore
near the Pontus Euxinus should enjoy great Happiness. But they are very
infamous for their Intemperance; for which Reason they were surnamed (...). And
L. 3. c. 14. Hist.
Aelianus Varro upbraids them with Drunkenness, prostituting their Wives to
Strangers, and Cowardice. And Menander says, that the Merchants of Byzantium
were so much addicted to Wine, that they rarely used to stir from the Bottle
all Night.

. 5. We read of several unfortunate Wars Concerning the Destruction of the
ancient Byzantium.
waged by the Byzantines in the ancient Histories; but the two last are most
remarkable. In the first of these two they were, according to Zonaras, closely
besieged by Severus; which Siege they endured with a great deal of Bravery and
Constancy for three Years; when, after a most obstinate Resistance, having
consumed all their Provisions, and lived for some time upon Human Flesh, they
were forced to surrender to Severus, who killed all their Soldiers and chief
Men, and dismantled the City: But the 2d proved the total Destruction of this
famous City under Gallienus; who, as Trebellius Pollio In Gal.
relates it, did make such a Slaughter among the Inhabitants of Byzantium, that
not one Family escaped his Wrath, unless it were perhaps such as happened to be
at the same time in Foreign Parts.

. 6. L. 2. c. 2.
Sozomenus affirms, that Constable. the Great having taken a Resolution to build a
City What induced Constantine to found this new City upon the Ruins of the
ancient Byzantium.
after his own Name, first attempted to lay its Foundation upon the Ruins of
the Ancient Troy, near the Sepulcher of Ajax; but being admonished in a Dream
to desist from that Enterprise, he had pitched upon the old Byzantium, which he
fortified with very strong Walls. There are others who believe that Constable. the
Great did build this City as a Bulwark and Check to the Greatness of the
Persians who were then very formidable in the East; and to keep the Syrians and
other Neighboring Nations in Obedience by this potent City.

. 7. And Constable. the Great being very desirous to The Reason of the sudden
Increase of this City.
enlarge his new City to the utmost of his Power, gave all imaginable
Encouragement to Strangers, by his great Liberality toward them. And St. Jerome
observes that Constable. the Great was so ambitious of enlarging this City, that he
transferred Colonies from other Places thither. L. 2. c. 2.
Sozomenus ascribes this sudden Increase of Constantinople partly to the Piety
of the Emperor, partly to the Charity and Liberality of its Inhabitants to
Strangers.

. 8. But the Chronologers are divided in their The Authors differ about the
Beginning of this Epoch.
Opinions concerning the true Beginning of the Encoenia of New Rome. Some there
are who make them coincident with the same Year the Council of Nic^a was
finished; among whom is L. 8. c. 26.
Nicephorus Callisthus, who has been severely reprimanded upon this Account by
Camerarius. Others differ two Years from our Opinion, induced by the Authority
of Cassiodorus; who says, that under the Consulship of Pacatianus and
Hilarianus, the City of Byzantium was called Constantinople after Constable. the
Great. But Ad An. Chr. 330
Coesar Baronius has sufficiently demonstrated, that Cassiodorus was led into
this Error by his wrong Computation of the Years of the Reign of Constantine.
Some recede but one Year from our Assertion, making the Encoenia of
Constantinople coincident with the Year 331 of Christ, and with the Consulship
of Annius Bassus and Ablabius Aegyptius; concerning which Fast. Cons.
Onuphrius cites these following Words:

HOC ANNO ANTE DIEM V. EID. MAY.

CONSTANTINOPOLIS NOVA ROMA AB IMPERATORE CAESARE CONSTANTINO MAXIMO PIO FELICE
AUGUSTO DEDICATA EST.

But Onuphrius's Opinion being not agreeable to the Relations of the ancient
Historians deserves in no wise any Preference before ours; which is founded
upon the Authority of the best Monuments of Antiquity.

. 9. To reconcile the different Opinions How to reconcile these Differences.
concerning the Beginning of this Epoch, it is to be observed that those that
fix its Beginning sooner than we, have begun their Computation from the time
its first Foundation was laid by Constantine; which was some Years before its
Consecration; Whereas those who reduce this Epoch from the 28th Year of the
Reign of Constantine have had respect to the time of its full Perfection, some
Years after its Consecration; as evidently appears from the Words of L. a. c. 9.
Philostorgius, who relates it to that time when Constantinople appeared in its
full Glory, so as to contend for the Superiority with Rome it self. But as to
the Opinion of Georgius Codinus Curopalates, who in his Origines
Constantinopolitanae, published by Georgius Do^sa, makes the Beginning of this.
Epoch coincident with the 12th year of the Reign of Constantine, it does not
deserve an Answer.

. 10. The Design of Constable. the Great to increase Concerning the Division of the
^^man Empire.
the Power and Strength of the Empire by Old and New Rome, one in the Western,
the other in the Eastern Part of the Empire, proved very pernicious in the End;
this unadvised Division having exposed the Empire to Ruin and Destruction. And
it has been well observed by C. 40 de Commit.
Onuphrius, that Constable. the Great, by removing the 15 Legions that guarded the
Borders of the Danube and Rhine, had invited the barbarous Nations of the
Goths, Alans, Burgundians, and Franks to overrun the Western Empire.

CHAP. XLVI. Of the Turkish Epoch, commonly called the Epoch of Hegira.
This Epoch begins from the time of the Flight of Mahomet from Meccha, which,
without Contradiction, happened in the Year of Christ 602, or in the Year of the
Julian Period 5335, on the 16th day of July, on the 6th Feria. But this Epoch
being composed of Lunar Years, consisting of 354 Days, 8 Hours, and 864
Scruples, its Connection is very difficult with the Julian Years.

. 1. SOme are of Opinion, that this Epoch owes its Offspring to Hagar, from
whence the The Origin ^. this Epoch.
Turks deduce their Origin. But it seems more probable that the same has its
Beginning from the time of the Flight of their Prophet Mahomet from the City of
Meccha. Consult Hottin. in Hist. Orient. p. 260. and seq.

Jom. Posterior. 7. Rajab. 8. Schaaban. 9. Ramadan. 10. Schavval. 11. Dulkaadah.
12. Dulheggiah.
CHAP. XLVII. Of the Persian Epoch, called commonly YEZDEJERD.
1. The Years of the Persian Epoch are equivalent to the Nabonassarean or
ancient Egyptian Years. 2. This Epoch derives its Name from Yezdejerd, the
Son of Schariar, the last Persian King. 3. The Grecian Epoch precedes the
Persian 344324 Days, and the Arabian is 3624 Days before the Persian Epoch,
according to the Testimony of Ulug Beg an Indian Prince on both Sides of the
River Ganges. 4. The Persian Era is coincident with the 1379th Year, and 3 d
Month, or 90 Days of the Nabonassarean Epoch, according to Alfraganus.
From these Characters it is evident that this Era began in the Year of the
Julian Period 5345, on the 16th day of June, on the third Feria. But because
the Connection of these Years with the Julian Years is very difficult, by
reason of their Difference, it will be too long to be inserted here.

of 365 Days; and their Months are (...), they add Five Days to the Month Aban,
which the Astronomers commonly insert in the latter end of the Year. The Names
of their Months are thus expressed by Gravius.

. 2. This Epoch has beyond all Question, its The Origin of this Epoch.
Beginning from the Times of Yezdejerd, or the Year of the Julian Period 5345.
The only Question is, whether it began with the Beginning of the Reign of this
Prince, or from the time of his Death. Alfraganus, Scaliger, Christmannus, and
several others, are for the last; to wit, from the time that Yezdejerd was
vanquished and slain by Oth^^an near the City of Merga. But the
beforementioned Vlug Beg, cited by Gravius, deduces its Origin from the
Beginning of the Reign of this Prince.

CHAP. XLVIII. Of the Jellalaean or Gelalaean Epoch, otherwise called the
Royal Epoch, and the Epoch of the Sultans.
This Epoch began in the Year of the Julian Period 5792, on the 14th day of
March, at the time of the Aequinox. It is composed of Solar Years consisting of
365 Days, 5 Hours, 49 Minutes and 53; From whence it is evident, that to
investigate its Connection with the Julian Period, you must subtract 5791 Years
and 7 Months.

of the Prince, who was the first Founder of this Epoch, but likewise those
who were of his Council. His Name was Albu Arsalan Elselegeuki, Elha^^araz,
Muschahi Sultan Corasan: The Names of his eight Counselors are as follows:
Omar, Elhaiama, Abu Hali, Hasen the Son of Haitham, Elbirum, Aba, Elo^apha,

FINIS.
Courteous Reader,
TO give you at once a short View of all these Epocha's, which (after our
general Doctrine of Time) we have treated of in this Epitome; and to show you
the most compendious Way of making an exact Connection betwixt the several
Epoch's we have exhibited in a small Table the Difference betwixt the Julian
Period and all the other Epocha's. As, for Example; If the Year of Christ 1664,
and the fifth Month of the Year, commonly called the Month of May, be given to
find out the Synchronisms of these Epocha's; you must know the Year of the
Julian Period: If therefore you add out of the abovementioned Table 4713 Years
to the before-said Sum, the Product will show you the Year of the Julian
Period, to wit, ^377, which is correspondent to the known Year of Christ. On
the other hand, If you subtract from the same Year the Sum you find opposite to
each Epoch, this shows you the true Method of making a just Connection betwixt
these Epocha's and the known Year of Christ. It is further to be observed, That
where you find an Asterisk or*, affixed to any of these Epocha's, it
indigitates, that the usual Computation of the Years of this Epoch is not
congruous to the Julian Period; and that therefore the Connection betwixt them
is to be looked for in our Computistica.
