TO THE KING's Most Excellent Majesty, The Humble Address of GEORGE Lord
DARTMOUTH, Admiral of Your Majesty's Fleet for the present Expedition, and the
Commanders of Your Majesty's Ships of War now actually at the Spithead in Your
Majesty's Service under his Lordships Command.
Most Dread Sovereign,
THE deep sense we have had of the great Dangers your Majesty's Sacred Person
has been in, and the great Effusion of Christian Blood that threatened this your
Majesty's Kingdoms, and in all probability would have been shed, unless God of
his infinite Mercy had put it into your Majesty's Heart to call a Parliament,
the only means in our opinion, under the Almighty, left to quiet the Minds of
your People; We do give your Majesty our most humble and hearty Thanks for your
gracious Condescension, beseeching God to give your Majesty all imaginable
Happiness and Prosperity, and grant that such Counsels and Resolutions may be
promoted, as conduce to your Majesty's Honor and Safety, and tend to the Peace
and Settlement of this Realm both in Church and State, according to the
Established Laws of the Kingdom.
