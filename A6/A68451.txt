A LETTER OF Mr. Casaubon. WITH A MEMORIAL OF Mris Elizabeth Martin, late
deceased.

MICAH 7.8. Rejoice not against me, O mine Enemy; when I fall, I shall arise;
when I sit in Darkness, the LORD shall be a Light unto me.

O te Beatum Cespitem tanto Hospite!
O cui invidere cuncta possint Marmora!
LONDON, Printed by NICHOLAS OXES for GEORGE NORTON. 1615.

To the Reader.
HAppening upon this Letter of Mr. CASAVBON (...), (writ (as may appear) upon
Extraordinary Occasion) together with some Funeral Lines, which (in regard of
the Subject) were a Piaculum to smother; Quis Thrax defunctis, in Christo (...)
neget?
I here offer them to thy courteous view. It is Piety (says Naz.) to publish
the deceaseds Virtues; yea, it is a means to increase grace in our own
selves. Vale; and sanctas Vmbras, Animamque plane diuinam, qua par est
Veneratione, sequere.

quid ab aliquo eorum fuerit super ea re sane mirabili scriptum, magnam inieris
a me gratiam si id mecum communicaueris. Ego Operi instituto Dei gratia finem
his diebus imposui; iamque me habet cura illiberalis de conficiendis indicibus:
quos confecit homo and doctus and bonus, sed ei negotio parum aptus: itaque
magna pars illius operae in humeros meos recidit, praesertim quod ad Auctorum

The same Englished. To his Singular and Honored Friend, etc.
I Received lately two Letters from you: The first transformed me wholly into
Wonder: without doubt the thing you write of, is miraculous: But WHENCE, I
cannot affirm. They may best conjecture, that were Eyewitnesses, or of their
nearest acquaintance, and they that have the Spirit of Discerning, etc. In
which regard I leave the discussing thereof to the Most Excellent Divines of
your Illustrious University. The Knowledge of it was pleasing to me; the Cause
I refer to them, whose Judgments on such an Admirable Event, I should be
very glad to hear. I have at length (by Gods Help) ended my Work ( against
BARONIVS) and am now busy in gathering the Index of Authors that are
Illustrated or Corrected. I have stirred a whole Hornets-nest of Adversaries;
the more confidently, in that I doubt not but some in England will defend my
Name from their base and unsavory Calumnies. Mr. Doctor Prideaux has lately
showed in an Excellent Work, what the Learned of this Kingdom judge of my
Labors. Your Love is of more force with me, then all the Spirits of
Detraction. I desire to hear further from you, etc.

LONDON, the VI. of the Ides of February: the 56t year of my Age, by the Grace
of my Merciful God, whom I beseech to cover what is past, and govern what is
to come.

On the Decease of my Incomparable Sister, Mistress ELIZABETH MARTIN.
TO the dear Memory of the most Dear,
I set apart this Ink, more sad then Tears:
These are the Cypresse-branches that I bear,
The mourning Habit that my sad Soul wears:
This the Impresa that my Sorrow bears:
If This, not feelingly define my Smart,
It Is not defect of Woe, but want of Skillful Art.
Within the Center of my Troubled Soul,
A Monument unto thy Name I Will build,
And there with Teare-fil'd Characters inroule
Those Bright Perfections that thy Life did guild;
The Grace-full Good that all thy Actions filled.
There shall my Love thy sad Loss memorize,
When all the World shall cease to mind thy Obsequies.
Then deigne to take of the Obscurest Hand
These well-deserued Attributes of praise;
I know thy Trophies not the higher stand
Because my Hand desired thy Name to raise:
Fair Angelized Soul, these humble Lays
And worthless Numbers give thy Light no luster,
But show those Shapeles Woes that in my Bosom muster.
MARY.

To her Soule-loued Sister, Mris E. M.
THough Marble, nor the Proudest Monument,
Can Splendour add to thy Starre-crowned Fame,
That now triumph'st above the Firmament,
Where Glorious Lights all Mortal Sparks out-flame:
Yet deigne (Sweet Saint) t'accept these lines of mine,
Which here I offer at thy Sacred Shrine:
EPITAPH.
Who living was Her Sexes ANADEM,
Heavens fair IDEA, Natures rarer GEM,
Needs not the Luster of DIVINEST PRAISE,
Tho Golden Statues KINGS to Her should raise;
Since that Her Name is registered on hye,
In th'Happy ANNALS of ETERNITY.
ANNE GRAY.

PARODIA.
SO down the Silver Streams of ERIDAN,
On either side bank't with a Lilly-wall,
Whiter then both, rides the Triumphant Swan,
And sings his Dirge, and prophesies his Fall,
Diving into his watery Funeral;
As SHE (whose Gold-beam'd fame shall never date)
Fore-warned in sleep, did prae-diuine her Fate.
So fairest Phosphor the bright Morning-starre,
But newly washed in the Green Element,
Before the drowzie Night is half aware,
Shooting his flaming Locks with dew besptent,
Springs lively up into the ORIENT;
As Globes of Winged Angels, swift as Thought,
ELIZA's Soul to her dear SAVIOVR brought,
Why spend we Tears (that never can be spent)
On her that VALE of TEARS no more shall see?
Why send we Sighs (that never can be sent)
To her that died to live, and would not be,
To be there where she would? here bury we
This Heavenly Earth; O let it softly sleep:
"Let Us not for Her, but for our own Sins weep.
Had I a voice of Steel to tune my Song,
Were every verse as smoothly filled as Glass,
And every Member turned to a Tongue,
And every Tongue were made of sounding Brass,
Yet all that Skill, and all that Strength, alas,
Should it presume to guild, were misadviz'd,
The Place, where now she reigns Imparadiz'd.
Impotent Words, weak Sides, that strive in vain,
In vain, t'emblazon that so heavenly Sight,
So Heavenly Sight, as none can greater feign,
Feign what he can, that seems of greatest Might,
Might any yet compare with Infinite?
Infinite sure those Joys, my words but light;
Light is the Palace where she dwelles. O Blessed Wight!
Blessed are the dead that dye in the Lord.
PENELOPE GRAY.

TO THE SOVLE.
PErfections fair Idea, that art crowned
With more rich Attributes of Excellence,
Than all the Wonders of this spacious Round;
Of more Regard, of Higher Consequence;
Above them all thou have Pre-eminence,
In thy most powerful Makers arms embraced,
And with his own Endowments amply graced.
Just, Holy, Righteous, Innocent and Wise:
Such is the Soul, Iehouahs sole beloved;
These are the Lusters of her Sphaery Eyes
That her to him unparalleled approved.
Angels, at this amazed, stand unmoved
To see the Glories that do her indow,
As Heaven it self to abject Earth should bow.
Then banish hateful Passion unto Hell,
That vailes with Cupids Scarf the clearest sight,
And does True Judgment from his Throne expel,
Circling with shades Heavens loue-deseruing Light,
Making Obscurity then Day more bright.
Disdain this servile Yoke of base Subjection,
For drossie Earth deserves not thy Affection.
Heavens brightest Abstract, can thou condescend
These mundane vanities to meditate?
Why do thou not thy best Devotions bend
Thy Mighty Makers Power to contemplate?
To Him, thy Love and Service consecrate,
Whose euer-gratefull Truth knows no Defect,
But gives for Love a more than dear Respect.
Mary. q. G.

* *

THe Church does not solemnize the Birth of Saints; it makes the day of their
Death a Festival: Diem Fatalem, Natalem; which is another kind of Birth then
the first; there being no more proportion betwixt the World out of which they
go, and Heaven whereinto they enter, then there is betwixt the Womb out of
which they go, and the World whereinto they enter. We must drink Thu Cup
IOYFVLLY when God presents it. Christ himself, his blessed Virgin Mother, all
the Saints in Heaven have begun to us. Christians, that have a firm hope (in
Christ) of Eternal Life, should not be skared with a Temporal Death. 1 Thessalonians. 5.9.10.
God has not appointed us to wrath: but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
Christ, who died for us, that whether we Wake or Sleep, we should live
together with Him.

FINIS.
