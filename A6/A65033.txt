A Vindication of the KING, with some Observations upon the two HOUSES, by a
true Son of the Church of England, and a Lover of his Countries Liberty.
READER,
I Shall not be curious to satisfy the Reason of any prepossest opinion, yet
since the Times has given an open Press to clear every imagination which is
not stifled in this Dampe. I have endeavored to contract my own Meditations
in a narrow room, and rather expose them to the censure of the most judicious,
then rest satisfied alone, and admit this cloudy surface to overwhelme so vast
a body.

I confess it was no mean part of my happiness in our dangerous extremes,
to hope for a happy Union by that sovereign medicine of a fading State, a
Parliament; and knowing the admirable affection of our gracious Sovereign to
the peace and quiet of the Kingdoms, though it was His unspeakable misfortune,
never to know the misery of the people, till their discontents were grown to
that head, they became almost (if not altogether) uncurable, by those
unreasonable and illegal Monopolies, exacted by some ill-affected agents,
conducing little to his advantage; but to the furthering of their ambition, who
notwithstanding could as easily desert him in his misery, as before be the
ready Instruments to importune him to this mischief, upon pretense of a Legal
Authority: which who knows not a Prince may be soon mistaken in, since none can
be so filly as to believe him a studied Lawyer: Yet that this should expose us
to so great an adventure, as not only to divest him of this suspected
Arbitrary power, but to confer an absolute Government to any whatsoever,
renders me no other axiom then the Poets, Incidit in Scyllam cupiens vitare
Carybdi^n. But if you please to take the true state of the business, let your
impartial Judgment confer with your Reason upon these few notorious truths.
What has the King denied which concern our Liberty, and are the undoubted
securities of our happiness under the Regiment of a just and unquestionable
Monarchy?

Are not our Rights and Properties already established this Parliament by such
Acts of Grace, as could never find Presidents from His Ancestors? besides the
utter extirpation of Ship Money, Monopolies, upon what pretense soever those
Arbitrary Courts of Justice, High Commission, Star Chamber, Marshal-seas,
etc. Has He not importuned the settling of Religion in its purity, and that
there might be a Law to secure the tender consciences of those who will not
agree to the Ceremonies? Are not the taking away these sufficient ground to
dissolve our Jealousies, if ever we meant to be satisfied? As for their fears,
I wish we had as little reason to suspect the fomenters, as we have the King;
who is so clearly divested of any power, to make good the least injustice,
that it is too great an hazard on His part, to adventure what our consciences
enforce us to make good for Him on our part; and the conservation of these are
so attested by Him (in the word of a King) with such unusual expressions, that
if they came from a Stranger, (I suspected not an Infidel) I was bound to
believe in charity? Witness those serious asseverations, God so deal with Me
and my Children, as I intend to conserve my Parliament in it is Privileges, the
Rights of the Subjects, and the true professed Protestant Religion, God so
prosper me in what I take in hand.

Is there yet a further way to establish them, whereby they may be so secure,
that a violation may seem impossible, without the subversion of the very
Letter of the Law? Why is it not proposed if it be no Invasion of that just
Prerogative, was never denied His Ancestors? and what He has deserved of us
that he may not be as far trusted, is as hard to object as easily answered. If
then we must needs agree that there being nothing so clear, why should any
subtle pretenses hinder our desired accommodation, unless there be such that
intend the alteration of our Government? and how inconsistent that may prove to
a People already managed under the united Order of a virtuous King, daily
experience offers it too easy of conjecture. Yet for our better satisfaction,
let us weigh the amends we are like to make our selves from these few
inconveniences, amongst the thousands which daily expose themselves to our view.

1. The unlimited power of the two Houses has already assumed into their own
hands a formal Ordinance, countermanding, suspending, nay, creating Acts of
Parliament, though not in the name of Acts, yet in the power of Acts, whereby
both King and People are obliged to obey; how to distinguish this Ordinance
from an Act of State, I am not well satisfied; yet I have heard it called
Treason in one of their Members for this comparison, though with that cautious
provisoe, That it should be no leading case to future ages for Judges to
imitate. Is this the security of our undoubted Rights we have so long
endeavored? who carries not now his life in his hand, managed by an exact
power of a bare Vote, which if any contradicts, must suffer under the name of a
Malignant party, though of their own Members; and not proceeded against by the
justice of any precedent Acts, but condemned by the Votes of the present
Session: and if this be not an absolute subversion of the Rights of Parliament,
and destructive to the fundamental Laws of our Kingdom (wherein our Liberty
consists) I would feign be satisfied what it is: for it is most apparent to
whosoever examines their ordinary proceedings, we have no Law left but what
serves their turn; and if that be defective to punish those they please to
call Delinquents, their Legislative Ordinance can as well supply that defect,
as it could make that obnoxious, which till this Parliament no man could ever
call a fault.

2. This continuing power of the two Houses, which if they had had a mind
should ever be remitted, they would have either expressed it in their first
demand, and limited it to a certain time, wherein they might have completely
qualified the disquiet countenance of a troubled Estate; or since have
endeavored some Remonstrance for our satisfaction in that particular: For I
would feign be answered, First, if they sit while they list, and pass what
they list, whether they have not (dureing their pleasure) subverted our
Monarchy by their Democracy, and invested themselves with a power more
Arbitrary then the Monarchical Government could pretend to; that having his
Limitations and Rules of Law, which the Judges are to answer (if they mistake)
or those that advise the King: their Democracy having no bounds, being but a
thing of yesterday, and which as yet we cannot understand, assuming to
themselves the sole power to judge of our dangers, and to propose such remedy
as may answer their pretenses.

3. How every conscientious man can dispense with that sacred Oath of
Allegiance, wherein he calls God to witness for the vindication of his Princes
just Prerogative, and their Protestation to maintain an absolute and unlimited
power in the two Houses, wrested to those Ordinances expressly inhibited by His
Majesty's special commands: in my understanding it is to no other purpose then
to lead us into a Maze, where, when we are lost by our misunderstanding (which
must necessarily be the principal of our subversion,) They will offer us a
Clue, shall either lead us to their premeditated designs, whereby of
necessity they will become our Masters; or to an inevitable ruin, before we
know the reason of our Fears and Jealousies, being the old rule they so often
enveighed against: First, to trouble the State, then to subvert the Government.
Let it not be objected now, That I am against Parliaments, for (God knows) I
am for them; and as zealous for my Country as any man that lives: But in my
opinion, the best way to secure our Liberty had been, That our Members of both
Houses might continue subject still, liable to the Regiment of those Laws
which shall be enacted by them; wherein they will have a care of securing their
own estates for the future, as well as ours, which was certainly the
intentions of our well advised Ancestors, in exposing so great a trust into
their hands, when the Prince called for their advice in matters of greatest
concernment; but by this continued Session, they not only are invested with an
absolute power, but are able to make themselves amends at leisure for those
moneys exhausted out of their estates, while we groan under the insupportable
burden of their (as they call them) Legal Taxes; and thus they may well be
careless what Laws are past, never intending to be observers, but Lords of
what they make.

3. Who are these pretended Reformers of the Commonwealth, but the very
Instruments who were the favorites during our oppression? I need not name them
to any, who has once attended the Epidemicke trouble of our age, and what
unheard of conversion we can make of their lives, whereby such a confidence
should be reposed in them, as to divest so Religious and Just a Prince of his
unquestionable Rights and Prerogatives, and confer such an unlimited power so
readily upon them, if we return to our former senses, renders me amazed; it is
not amiss to ruminate some words His Majesty used in His own vindication at
Newmarket: My Lords, lay your hands on your hearts, who were the contrivers of
these illegal Taxes, wherewith you have so incensed my people? to whose
advantage were these impositions levied? are my Exchequers at all larger, or
did they not rather conduce to your peculiar benefit? who were the only
perswaders of them, that you have now repaid me with condign thanks? Those
Favorites being content to be the causers, though not companions of their
Princes misfortunes, being like Crows upon a carcass, that have no sooner
bared the bones but they are flowne; are we not yet sensible, the rules of
policy, not of honesty, to secure their lives and fortunes, not their
consciences, exposed you to this politic, not public service? and had you
not in so exact a course served your turns of these loyal pretenders, they
had been as liable to the extremity of Justice as the greatest Delinquents,
that under-went the most heavy censures; and undoubtedly had had their deserved
shares, which would have given a better color to their upright proceedings, as
they would have you so believed, if they had impartially distributed Justice
amongst the then Malignant party: But now that we should be so stupid as to be
circumvented with any pretenses whatsoever, which outstrip the Essential
rules of Government or Reason, and confide in the positive Vote of an ambitious
party, for ought we know, would admit my perswader to be a mad man that could
allow that in his opinion. But make them what you will, suppose them to be the
most real and upright men in their lives and consciences in the whole world,
They are but the Counsel of the King and Kingdom, not their Commanders; for
the health of our State is admirably balanced, if that have but its due
proportion: The Parliament consisting of three bodies, the King, the Lords and
Commons; so that if two should be destructive, and the third remain sound,
during those Laws already in force, there can be no danger to our Kingdom; but
if either of the two can pass at their pleasure what they will, the third must
then of necessity stand for a Cipher, for consenting or disagreeing is then of
equal value, and in my opinion it is a president of too great an adventure; for
suppose the King and the major part of the Lords should agree an Ordinance or
Law, we should think it extremely prejudicial to the Liberty of the Subject,
our Commons should be concluded peremptorily against their consents. I heard an
Act not long since vouched in president, that had been ratified against the
consent of the Lords Spiritual, where they declared nec possumus, nee volumus
consentire; and this so rare we could not find a second. At the Parliament at
Oxford in 17. H. 3. when the Lords were not there present, they were feign to
dissolve the House without passing one Act, confirming my first proposition,
That the consent of two bodies are not of force to make us Laws without the
third, much less conclude. The King, who is not only the supreme head, but
the very soul, whose power gives life to their actions, when their body is
once dissolved; besides, how incoherent is it with that authority committed to
them? for if the Parliament (which are only his great Council) offer him a
Bill, which He is bound to agree unto, it was more then ever His Ancestors
were; and of his Counselors, it must necessarily follow they are His
Commanders.

We have a Maxim with the Subject, Modu^ and conventio vincunt legem: In
former ages, and ever since Parliaments were in use, Le Roy s^avisera were
sufficient authority to make a Bill of both Houses unwarrantable; and how the
King has lost that Right, or what new Laws are found out destructive to that
Prerogative, I never yet read, nor ever shall, unless some such new Ordinance
or bare Votes can pretend to such an unwarranted power, (whereof there was
never yet found a President) which can have no other operation upon my
understanding, then, That the Votes of the present Members which can at their
pleasures dispose the undoubted Privileges of the Crown (by a Law recorded
only in their own breasts) and giving out to us, under the gilded Title of
the Peoples Liberty, when indeed they are but Golden Chains instead of
Bulrushes, and (reserved till occasion shall make it too apparent) may find
out a Law of equal force to dispose the Crown, when they shall so far
debilitate the Prince, as he shall be no way able to make resistance; for when
the supporters are not only undermined, but clearly taken away, by what reason
can we imagine the Structure may continue firm? that you may be sure we will
not unjustly charge them, be pleased to observe with me their Orders in these
few instances.

1. Their countenancing these unwarranted Acts, either by a seditious huddle of
indigent people, and so procuring Petitions to necessitate these premeditated
proceedings, or leavying an absolute War against the King; securing us upon
no other reasons then that they are the representative body of the Kingdom,
and therefore our Obedience rather to be expected, then our Reason satisfied,
which indeed is true enough, if they proceeded upon that warranted rule to
which no man could refuse observance, or being entrusted by Us with the power
of preceding Parliaments; that they would pursue points of so high concernment,
with the same mature reasons and deliberations, as they have done, and then
they might well expect our readiness to secure their actions. But suppose we
elect one that should speak or endeavor to enact Treason, does our election
bid us to secure him, or will future Parliaments blame us hereafter for giving
up so great a Delinquent to the justice of the Laws? dare we countenance their
Intentions, who have fetched Presidents from the weakest Princes, (nay, and go
beyond them too) to the disadvantage of as able a Prince as ever yet held the
Scepter; nay, and offer their suppositions to the Vulgar, If the Prince be a
fool, a child, etc. ought he not to be governed by his Council, though it be
against his consent, if it stand with the public benefit: what implication to
make of this I understand not, but I am sure that it was none of our meaning
when we gave our voice in the Election? Can an Ordinance of Parliament, without
the consent of the King, renew a repealed Act, and with so bold a countenance
trample upon the heels of that Parliament in Richard the seconds time, and
this very repealed Act renewed this Parliament, be within one step of it,
wherein the Parliament took the Crown, and gave it to the then Earl of
Bullingbrooke; which was the reason of so much blood in our Civil wars, and
was not well settled till of late years? And can we blame the King if He
desire shelter from such a storm: If it be their intentions, sure one
Bullingbrooke will not serve their turns, since there has been equal shares
in this so great an adventure. And to vouch the Oath of this Usurper H. 4.
which came in at their benevolence to a Prince of an unquestionable Title, and
never offered before or since to any English King that ever we read or heard of
(but with its limitations) is so far from their loyal pretenses, that they are
rather to be believed studied mischiefs, and endeavors, to embroyle the
Kingdom in a Civil War.

2. To disingage all that would out of affection, or love, interest themselves
to secure the Kings Person and Dignity (it being too apparent to any ordinary
understanding) that such proceedings were never warranted by any precidents of
preceding Parliaments, or those Laws they call fundamental in our Kingdom,
they scandalize such with the name of malignant Persons, whereby His Meniall
Servants, either absolutely refused, or durst not adventure His attendance, and
countenance this medley in such a sense, that the King Himself is perpetually
traduced under this obstruse Dialect; which though they dare not put down in
plain English, for fear the most violent amongst them should be ashamed to
own it: yet by such an implication, as the plainest capacity cannot but blush,
and with admiration wonder, whereto this may tend, I would feign be satisfied
what these might not do, when they had once mastered these their malignants:
For if you will give us as much reason as the Ants, you must believe a Winter
may come, as well as think a Summer is come: durst any man then oppose their
proceedings, when they have reduced all to their own Terms; do you not speak
your selves the very Law, and we as we ought to yield no appeal from
Parliament, being the highest Court in the Kingdom; yet in this sense as the
King is a part of it, (for otherwise I understand not by what right) it has the
pre-eminence of those they call the Kings Courts, being both conveen'd by the
same Royal Authority.

3. The discountenancing any Petitions whatsoever, (wherein we desire to
interpose our advice for accommodation, or otherwise) though never so agreeing
with our Laws, unless they stand with the sense of their party, as if all our
Wisdom were shut up in so narrow limits, and these the only men in England
infallible: yet give me leave to aver, That to the number of almost two
hundred approved able men, whose warranted judgment and sufficiencies were the
only inducement of their Countries Election, have been feign to sit still,
and see things carried in this disorderly confusion, (peremptorily against
their earnest endeavors) and have not been so much as asked their opinions in
matters of greatest concernment; but being unwilling to expose their
Consciences to so high a Guilt, have withdrawn themselves as unusefull Members
of such a Body.

3. To insinuate a belief of their care to the Vulgar, They have perpetually
surmised terrible Jealousies, which have produced no other effect then a
desired suspicion of the King; yet these offered upon most improbable
conjectures, as every private Letter is sufficient grounds to piece up their
designs, or by such persons whose private discontents lead them to offer
these high indignities to that sacred Person, they were never worthy to serve
in the meanest Office; and though their Lives were so notorious for their
former extravagancies, they have by these superfluous invectives found
countenance, till presuming upon their merits, which were none, except to abuse
the King, can be called desert; That they have been given up to rapine, or
some such damnable sin, that nature would never have pardoned, if we had had
no Law; Yet these men's informations, sufficient ground to traduce the King,
these Letters most necessary Animadversions to leavy Forces, to maintain the
Kings Forts, Towns, and Magazines against Him; I, and in His own name too, as
if they could derive that authority from Him, that has no power (according to
your Ordinance) to leavie them in His own Defense, though His Person is in
never so apparent imminent danger; yet they for His good, and the good of the
Kingdom, can pretend to this power, and beyond: yet that all is not of that
infallibility, let Mr Pyms Letter from Sir John Hotham witness with me.

I have committed these few Observations, to the view of the Public, finding
so many bold Pamphlets (with so high impudence) fly at the Face of Majesty
unreproved, and every corner stinks of this unclean Doctrine; yet since it is
come to this height, that we must declare our selves, or loose our King: wherein
my purpose fails, my life shall make good to my last breath; but if Religion,
Reason, and Law had not warranted so just a cause, I should never have
adventured to clear a glass to so foul a countenance: yet before I conclude,
let me propose one question in Religion: Whether the Church was not in it is
purity in the Primitive times? the World agrees they had in those days a King
that was no Christian? Whether Christ had not more power (then ever any can or
dare pretend to since) to eclipse that Regal Dignity if it had been
destructive to the Church? yet he refused the lowest office of a Magistrate,
But gave to Caesar the things that were His; for when the young man came to
him, and said, Lord command my brother that he divide the Inheritance with me:
He replies, Who made me a Ruler, or a judge amongst you? But now that we
having a Christian King, professing by His unblemisht Life, the same way to
salvation with us, protesting to conserve our Liberties with His Life, to make
such an apparent difference, which may be the occasion of the effusion of so
much Christian Blood, upon mere Jealousies, will be the most unheard of
disloyalty that can be committed to future Ages.

WILTSHIRE'S Resolution, presented with the Contributions of diverse Gentlemen
to His Majesty's Commissioners at OXFORD,
FOrasmuch as we whose names are hereto subscribed, having taken the late
Protestation recommended unto this Kingdom in general, according to the
direction of both Houses of Parliament, with His Majesty's consent, whereby we
hold our selves most especially bound and engaged to defend, and maintain with
our lives and fortunes according to our utmost abilities, the Protestant
Religion established by authority of diverse past Parliaments since the
Reformation, and also His Majesty's Royal Person, and Prerogative, the just
and ancient Privileges of Parliaments, the Laws of this Land, and the Liberty
of the Subject. And whereas it is evident unto us, that at this present by the
malicious practices of some dangerous spirits, the Protestant Religion has
received manifest detriment by calumniating, discountenancing, and imprisoning
diverse painful, reverend, and orthodoxe Divines, as namely Dr Featley, Dr
Oldsworth, Mr Shute of London, and many other men of approved soundness in
Doctrine, and unspotted integrity in their lives and conversations, and almost
in all places obtruding anabaptisticall, Brownisticall, and Schismatic
Teachers of falsehood, and rebellion, to the dishonor of God, and scandal of
the Pulpit, abused nowadayes to seduce us from the Loyalty and piety which made
our Forefathers, and our selves formerly happy, and to engage us in a Civil
war one against another. The much, and much worthy to be reverenced Liturgy,
and Common Prayer of our Church grown infamous, and a reproach to those that
use it, and all possible endeavor used utterly to expunge it.

And having been bold with God in his worship, no wonder if they proceed to
the injury of his Vicegerent, our most Gracious Sovereign, who opposing as
much as in him lay, those, and other unjust and illegal proceedings, was by
their subriltie rendered suspected to His Subjects of inclining to Popery, and
many other matters equally false; that under such hateful jealousies, He might
by degrees become less beloved of His Subjects, and they brought into the
condition they are at this time in open war against him, wherein, lest they
should relent, they are made believe it is for the safety, and defense of His
Person; the most absurd gullery that ever was put upon a Nation.

And as the KING did not alone dislike these injuries done to God and Himself,
so neither alone does He suffer; for with him most of the most Learned, and
judicious Members of both Houses, whose Nobleness, Honor, Virtues, Piety,
Religion, and clear understandings, made them declare themselves averse to the
present course of the times, have been either imprisoned or stigmatized with
the brand of Traitors, and Papists, or at the least malignants, and Prelatists:
these and such like have been all the Privileges of Parliaments allowed the
Worthies of our times, and worse is hatching for them if the Divine providence
preserve them not.

Are our ancient Laws in any better condition, or seem they not as dead as
their prudent contrivers? do not newborn Votes supply their room, and newborn miseries attend them? the KING, his Wife, and Children, voted and
forcibly kept out of all that is due to them, we are required to be assisting
hereto; if not, we shall be voted to be plundered, and our goods and estates
sequestered, and all this is pretended to be for the Liberty of the Subject: we
have liberty indeed to give, but no liberty to deny: and we must give not as we
know we are able, but as they think fit, and this they have the impudence to
publish.

These things being taken into our serious consideration, and the times now
requiring us to declare our selves, since we can no longer be at peace: first
condoling the general calamity of our selves, and Ireland, we profess to all
the world, that we cannot see or find any other lawful way to free us from the
distresses we are in, then by our best assistance of His Sacred Majesty,
against all that shall oppose Him in an assured confidence that His purpose is
as He has declared, and no other, than to maintain and establish the
Protestant Religion, as it has been in authority and use in this Kingdom
ever since Edward the sixth, and likewise His own just and true prerogative,
and inheritance, derived unto Him from His Ancestors Kings, and Queens of
England, and also the rights and privileges of Parliaments, that have been
always justly due to them; to whom we conceive His Majesty ought especially to
hearken, as has been the custom of his Royal Predecessors, they seeking in
all humility His assent to their debates and resolutions, by reason, not by
force; and also the ancient Laws of this Kingdom, and all other Acts of
Parliament, ratified by the Kings consent. And lastly, the Liberty and Property
of the Subject: Hereto we hold our selves bound by Conscience and vow to God,
Loyalty to our King, and duty to our Country: and so God prosper us as we
shall be assisting to His Majesty in the accomplishment of all this.

His MAJESTY'S Letter to both Houses of PARLIAMENT, the 20th of January. 1641.
HIS Majesty perceiving the manifold distractions which now are in this
Kingdom, which cannot but bring great inconvenience, and mischief to this
whole Government; In which, as His Majesty is most chiefly interessed, so He
holds himself by many reasons, most obliged to do what in Him lies for the
preventing thereof; Though He might justly expect (as most proper for the duty
of Subjects) that propositions for the remedies of these evils ought rather to
come to Him, then from him; yet His Fatherly care of all His people being such,
that He will rather lay by any particular respect of his own dignity, then
that any time should be lost for prevention of these threatening evils, which
cannot admit the delays of the ordinary proceedings in Parliament, does think
fit to make these ensuing propositions to both Houses of Parliament.

That they will with all speed fall into serious consideration of all those
particulars, which they shall hold necessary, as well for the upholding and
maintaining of His Majesty's just and Legal Authority, and for the settling of
His Revenue, as for the present and future establishing of their privileges,
the free and quiet enjoying of their Estates and Fortunes, the liberties of
their Persons, the security of the true Religion now professed in the Church of
England, and the settling of Ceremonies in such a manner, as may take away all
just offense; which when they shall have digested, and composed into one entire
body, that so His Majesty, and themselves may be able to make the more clear
judgment of them, it shall then appear by what His Majesty shall do, how
far He has been from intending, or designing any of those things, which the
too great fears and jealousies of some persons seem to apprehend: And how
ready He will be to equal and exceed the greatest examples of the most
indulgent Princes in their Acts of Grace, and Favor to their people.

So that if all these present distractions (which so apparently threaten the
ruin of this Kingdom) do not (by the blessing of Almighty God) end in an
happy and blessed Accommodation; His Majesty will then be ready to call Heaven
and Earth, God and Man to witness, that it has not failed on His part.

FINIS.
