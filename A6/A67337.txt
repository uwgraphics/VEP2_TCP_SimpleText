Of the LADY MARY, etc.
I.
AS once the Lion Honey gave,
Out of the Strong such Sweetness came;
A Royal HERO no less Brave,
Produced this Sweet, this Lovely DAME.
II.
To Her the Prince, that did oppose
Such Mighty Armies in the Field,
And Holland from Prevailing Foes
Could so well free, Himself does yield.
III.
Not Belgia's Fleet (his high Command)
Which Triumphs where the Sun does rise;
Nor all the Force he Leads by Land,
Could Guard Him from Her Conquering Eyes.
IV.
ORANGE with Youth Experience has,
In Action Young, in Counsel Old:
ORANGE is what Augustus was,
Brave, Wary, Provident, and Bold.
V.
On that Fair Tree, which bears His Name,
Blossoms and Fruit at once are found;
In Him we all admire the same,
His Flowery Youth with Wisdom Crowned.
VI.
Empire and Freedom Reconeil'd,
In Holland are, by Great NASSAW,
Like those He sprung from, Just and Mild,
To Willing People He gives Law.
VII.
Thrice Happy PAIR! so near Allied
In Royal Blood, and Virtue too:
Now Love Your Hearts so fast has tied,
May none this Triple Knot undo.
VIII.
The Church shall be the Happy Place,
Where Streams which from the same Source run,
(Though diverse Lands a while they Grace)
Unite again and are made One.
IX.
A Thousand Thanks the Nation owes
To HIM that does Protect Us all:
For while He thus His NIECE bestows,
About Our Isle He builds a Wall.
X.
A Wall like that, which Athens had,
By the Oracles advice, of Wood;
Had theirs been such, as CHARLES has made,
That Mighty STATE till now had stood.
By Mr. Waller of Beconsfield.
