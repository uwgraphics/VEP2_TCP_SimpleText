Unconstant Phillis.
OR, The Unfortunate Shepherds Lamentation.
A Shepherd Swain in Love with Phillis fair,
By her disdain in brought to such despair,
That doubtless he will dye without relief,
Such is his sorrow, and so great his grief,
His Phillis loved him once, but he neglected
The present time, and now he is rejected.
To an excellent new playhouse Tune: Or, Tell me no more you love.




HOw cruel is Fortune grown,
to turn all my hopes to despair
From bliss I am headlong thrown,
and banished the sight of my dear:
Grant me some pity kind heaven,
to my sorrows afford some relief,
Or let my poor soul be given,
a Martyr unto my grief.
All night I can take no rest,
but Phillis is still in my mind,
In dreams I with her am blessed,
but waking I find her unkind;
Which pierces my heart full sore,
and wounds me in every vein,
So much that I cry and roar,
whilst she Triumphs in disdain.
Ah Phillis remember yet,
what pleasing delights I gave,
I am sure you cannot forget,
you said I was brisk and brave:
'Twas under the Sycamore tree,
then, then, Oh then that same time,
You vowed that you did love me,
and counted not love a crime.




Those kisses you gave me then,
will witness against your hate,
Come Kiss me so once again,
and I Will never complain of my fate:
Those delights you would equally share
which were you consenting you would find;
Come hanged never sigh nor fear,
but do it with a willing mind.
If that I for love should dye,
you would want such a faithful friend;
You know it as well as I,
I need not my self commend:
Your kindnesses i^le reward,
and doubly your love i will requite;
Then Phillis my suit regard,
and rob me not of my right.
Ah! was it not better far?
when lovingly we did meet;
Then cruel thus as you are,
with hatred your Lover to greet:
That life which does yet remain,
to love I for ever resign;
And though I do suffer pain,
the fault shall he none of mine.
I am plunged in a desperate Pool
of folly, as well as Love,
For he is negligent Fool,
that will not his time improve;
My Phillis once gave me her heart,
and loved me more dearer than life,
She vowed she would never part,
but live with me as a Wife.
I trusted too much on her vow,
and was not so fond as she,
Which makes me repent it now,
because she is cruel to me:
This makes me distracted and mad,
and shall never be quiet in mind,
To think of those joys I have had,
and find pretty Phillis unkind.
Ye powers of love can tell
my passion is true and just;
My Phillis I love so well,
that without her I perish must:
So passionate's my desire,
and so eagerly burns the flame;
That glady I could expire,
repeating her very name.
I Will to her, and once again
my desperate sorrows relate,
One smile would relieve my pain,
and banish my threating fate:
If now I do fancy aright,
and the God of love stand but my friend
Then I shall have such delight,
that never can have an (...)
End.
