Stuart
By the King. A Proclamation for the better encouragement, and advancement of
the Trade of the East Indie Company, and for prevention of excess of private
Trade.
HIS MAJESTY taking notice of diverse abuses which had been practiced by
Commanders, Officers, Servants, and others employed by the Governor and
Company of Merchants of London, trading into the East Indies, for their own
private use in the Ships of the said Governor and Company, in the third year
of His Reign, by His Highness Proclamation then published, did straightly
charge and command, that no particular man of the said Company, nor any of
their Officers or Servants, or any other which then were, or then after should
be employed in any of their Ships trading into the said Easterly parts, or any
other person or persons whatsoever, should from thencefoorth drive any
underhand Trade, either to, in, or from the Indies aforesaid, but such as
should be Licensed by the said Company; And that such Goods and Commodities as
should be Imported, should not be disposed of until the said Company should
have received an account, and given allowance thereof, and until that their
Ships should have arrived at, or in the Port of London, within this Kingdom,
nor that any person or persons whatsoever, should presume to buy, contract,
bargain, or barter for, or receive, or take any of the Goods, Wares, or
Merchandises which should be laden aboard any of the said Ships bound
homeward, until such Ship or Ships so homeward bound, as aforesaid, or out of
which such Wares or Merchandises should be so bought, sold, delivered,
contracted, or bartered for, were first brought into the said Port of London,
and thereby the allowance of the said Company were duly entered, and the Goods
thereout discharged, nor should give any assistance, help or encouragement,
for the vnlading of any such Goods at any other places, or in any other manner,
nor should otherwise offend in any thing contrary to the true meaning of the
said Proclamation, as thereby more at large it does and may appear.

And although the said Governor and Company for the better encouragement of all
such persons as should be employed by them in their Ships and Voyages, as
Commanders, Factors, Captains, Masters, Officers, Mariners, or Soldiers,
besides the extraordinary great wages which they are accustomed to pay in their
employments, have given License unto all and every such person and persons as
aforesaid, to adventure and trade for their proper and private accounts, either
to, in, or from the said Indies, in any ship or ships, wherein they or any of
them were, or should be personally employed, in such wares and merchandise
only, and in such quantities and proportions thereof, as in a Declaration of
Orders made by the said Governor and Company, and allowed by His Majesty, are
set down and expressed, and as hereafter follows, viz.

The wares or Merchandise which are licenced to be exported, are Perpetuanoes,
Drapery Pewter, Saffron, Woollen-stockings, Silke-stockings, Silke-garters, and
ribband Roses', edged with gold-lace, Beauer-hats with gold and silver bands,
Felt-hats, Aquauite, and all other sorts of Strong Water, Knives of all sorts,
Spanishleather-shooes, Iron, and Looking-glasses;

The Wares which are licensed to be brought from the East Indies into England
are, Long-Pepper, white Pepper, white powdered Sugar, preserved Nutmegs,
preserved Ginger, preserved Mirabilons, Bezer-stones, Drugges of all sorts,
Aggat-beads, Bloodstones, Musk, Aloes Soccatrina, Ambergreece, Rich Carpets of
Persia and Cambaia, Quilts of Satin, and of Taffitey, and of painted
Callicoes, Benjamin, Damaskes, Sattens, and Taffities of China, Quilts of China
imbroydered with gold, Quilts of Petauia imbroydered with silk, Galls,
Wormseedes, Sugercandy, China dishes, and Puslaines of all sorts.

And whereas, each particular man employed as aforesaid, might heretofore lade
and adventure, for his own private and proper Account, in the Wares and
Merchandises aforesaid, and not otherwise, so much only as could be packed in
one Chest of four foot long, one foot and half broad, and one foot and a
half deep, and such as were Commanders, Factors, Captains, Masters, Pursers,
and Masters mates of every Ship, might have a double proportion, that is to
say, two Chests of the said length, depth, and breadth, free from charge of
freight; His Majesty finding that the said Proclamation has not as yet
produced that good effect as was intended thereby: Neither has the favor and
liberal allowance of the said Company taken such effect, but that the
Officers, Factors, and Servants employed in the Voyages aforesaid, for their
own private gain, though to the common damage of the said Company, have
adventured both outward and homewards, and also in the Indies, to carry, buy,
sell, and barter diverse other goods, wares, and merchandises.

And being informed, that the said Company are content to give them further
allowance, viz. To Commanders, Captains, and Factors four such Chests a
piece, to Masters three such Chests a piece, to every of the Pursers mates,
Masters mates, Boatswaines, Carpenters, Gunners, Stewards, to such, two Chests
a piece; Does therefore straightly Charge and Command all such as are, or
hereafter shall be employed in any Voyages for the said Governor, and Company,
whatsoever they be, to yield due obedience in all things to the said
Proclamation, under the pains and penalties therein contained, and such
further pains as may be inflicted upon the offenders by the Laws of this
Realm; Willing, requiring, and authorizing the Governor and Company
aforesaid, to depute under their Common Seal, sufficient and able persons, to
go on board and search all and singular their Ships and Vessels, either
outward or homewards bound, as well upon the Seas, as in the Port of London, and
in all other Ports, Havens, Rhodes, and places both in the Realm, as in the
parts of India, and other places in the passage, or abiding of their Ships:

And if they shall find any goods, wares, or merchandise to be carried or put
to sale contrary to the said Proclamation, and not tolerated by the Order of
the said Company as aforesaid, or otherwise allowed by them, to take and seize
them for the use of the said Governor and Company. And all those that shall be
found contrariant and rebellious, to take, arrest, imprison, and detain in
prison, until they shall be delivered according to Our Laws; And to cause
their names, and the quality of their offenses to be delivered to some of His
Majesty's learned Council, whom His Majesty does also hereby command and
require, to exhibit one or more Informations in His Highness Court of
Star Chamber, or in any other His Majesty's Courts of Justice, to the end that
such as shall be found Delinquents, may receive condign punishment for their
offenses justly deserved.

And His Majesty being so sensible of the inconveniences that attend upon the
said abuses before mentioned, and intending to have an absolute reformation
thereof, does therefore hereby straightly charge and command all Admirals,
Viceadmirals, and other Officers of the Admiraltie, and such as have Admiral
jurisdiction, and all Majors, Portreeues, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Customers,
Comptrollers, Searchers, and all other his Officers whom it may concern, that
they and every of them be careful to prevent the said abuses, and to be
ayding, helping and assisting to the said Governor and Company, their Officers
or servants, to be employed in the due execution and performance of this His
Majesty's Command, as they or any of them will answer the contrary at their
perils.

Given at the Court at Whithall, the nineteenth day of February, in the seventh
year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord King Charles of England, Scotland,
France, and Jreland, Defender of the Faith, etc.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
MAJESTY: and by the Assigns of John Bill. M.DC.XXXI.
