A TREATISE OF SPOUSALS, OR Matrimonial Contracts: WHEREIN All the QUESTIONS
relating to that Subject are ingeniously Debated and Resolved.

By the late Famous and Learned Mr. HENRY SWINBVRNE, Author of the Treatise of
Wills and Testaments.

LONDON, Printed by S. Roycroft for Robert Clavell at the Peacock in St. Paul's
Churchyard. 1686.

TO THE READER.
I Need not spend much time (I hope) in recommending this Treatise to Public
perusal; it is sufficient, I suppose, to give it a Reputation in the World, when
I assure you, that it was composed by the Learned and Ingenious Mr. Henry
Swinburne, Author of the Treatise concerning last Wills and Testaments. If any
Man should question the Truth of this, I dare appeal to his own Judgment, after
he has considerately perused some few Leaves of the ensuing Discourse, whether
the exactness of the Method, the plainness of the Style, the familiar and easy
way of Arguing, the pertinency of the Marginal Quotations for proving of every
Point of Law that he asserts or lays down (as the peculiar custom of that
Author was) do not sufficiently convince him, that the Treatise of Wills, and
this of Spousals were penned by one and the same Hand: But, if occasion
required, the Reader might be yet more fully satisfied by the Original
Manuscript, all writ by Mr. Swinburne's own Hand, which is yet extant, and may
take away all possibility of question or scruple.

The Subject of this Treatise is a matter of the highest moment and importance,
the Questions and Difficulties, that arise about it, are of the greatest
Variety and Niceness, and the frequent occasion there may be, for the Matters
here discoursed of and debated, to fall out in Practice, cannot but render the
Treatise useful, as well as pleasant, and by consequence very acceptable. It Is
possible at the first sight some Men may imagine, that Spousals are now in
great measure worn out of use, and by consequence that Discourses of that
Nature can yield little or no benefit to the Reader. But to this I answer, That
the Rules concerning Spousals are for the most part as well applicable to
Marriage as them, and that there is no difference in Substance betwixt.
Spousals de praesenti (which make up a principal part of this Book) and
Matrimony, only the Public Office, and greater Solemnity of the Act, together
with the Benediction of the Minister, are by Law requisite to complete the
Matrimony, before it be capable of those Legal Effects of Dower and
Legitimation of Issue. But in foro conscientiae they are as much Man and Wife,
as if all Legal Requisites and Solemnities had been performed. Nay, as to some
Legal Effects also, a Contract de praesenti has the same force that a lawful
Marriage has; for the Contract is indissoluble so long as the Parties live; and
if either Party shall after such Contract attempt to marry elsewhere, that
Marriage is null and void ratione praecontractus, as much as if the Parties
contracting had been lawfully married together; and the Parties marrying
elsewhere, after such Contract made, are to be Divorced, and the Persons
contracting may by Course of Law be compelled to Solemnize Matrimony according
to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church. And besides, in all Marriages
Solemnized after the most strict manner, the Contract of the Parties is the
principal Ingredient and most essential Part, all other Matters being only as
it were Foreign and Extrinsical to its Nature; although (I must confess) Divine
Invocation and the Minister's Benediction have ever in all Ages been accounted
necessary to its right Celebration and Performance. So that it is plain the most
difficult Cases that can relate to Marriages must be considered of and
discussed under this Head of Contracts or Spousals.

In ancient Times Spousals did regularly precede Marriage, Nam Mos fuit
Veteribus Stipulari and Spondere sibi Uxores futuras. l. Sponsalia 2. ff. de
Sponsal. And in some places the Woman, after these Spousals, presently
cohabited with the Man, but continued unknown till the Marriage-day. In our
Public Office of Marriage, Spousals and Matrimony are united, and performed in
one continued Act; When the Minister demands, Will thou have this Woman to thy
wedded Wife, etc. And the Man answers, I will, and so the Woman vice versa,
there is a Specimen of Spousals de futuro. When the Man repeats the Words, J.N.
take thee N. to my wedded Wife, etc. and so the Woman vice versa, there is the
form of Spousals de praesenti, which in Substance are perfect Matrimony, (as I
said before) though not as to all Legal Effects. When the Minister adds his
Benediction, and pronounces them to be Man and Wife, then it is a perfect
Marriage to all constructions and purposes in Law.

It may possibly be wondered at, that a Piece of this Nature, treating upon so
rare and useful a Subject, and penned by a Person of that Fame in the World,
should lie so long concealed, and never in all this time be committed to the
Press. But then it is to be considered, that Manuscripts of this Nature
commonly fall into the Hands of Men of the same Profession, and these commonly
preserve them for their own private use, and think it not their Interest to
communicate that Knowledge at so easy a Rate, which perhaps, has cost them
many years Study and Experience, and no small Charge in Understanding and
Attaining to. Nay, some go so far as to think, that the fewer Books there are
published of their Profession, the more Advantage it will still be to the
Practitioners, seeing Men will be then necessitated upon every Point to have
recourse to Counsel. But as to the first, Certainly the Public Advantage ought
in all reason to be preferred before any Man's Private Vtility, which is too
mean a thing to stand in competition with it: The Benefit that may redound to
the Generality of Men by its Publication, will in reason far outweigh the
Private Profit, that any Person may get or propound to himself by its
Concealment and Suppression. And, as to the second, Certainly it is the Honor,
and must be the Advantage of the Profession, to have Men of Sense write Books,
and make it Easy and Intelligible. Men commonly have a kindness for what they
know and understand; and on the contrary, that which they are not versed in,
and cannot attain without great Pains and Difficulty, they are apt to despise
and hate: I am so far from thinking it the Interest, that I take it to be a
manifest Injury and Misfortune to so Ingenious a Study and Profession, to be
kept concealed, and the Knowledge of it confined to so few Hands, we ought in
all reason to expect and presume, that the more it is known, and the justice and
reasonableness of its Rules considered, the more it will be courted and
admired, and the Practice advanced and enlarged; that strength of Reason, and
variety of good Learning, accompanied with those great Advantages of Method and
Style, with which the Books writ in that Science do generally abound, will,
when they are well known and weighed, rather, in all probability, force its
Reception and Entertaiment even amongst Men, whose Interest it is to suppress
and keep it low, much more among Persons disinteressed and unbyassed, and make
it flourish in despite of opposition.

I have been credibly informed, That the worthy Author of this Discourse had a
design to oblige the Public, by writing three Treatises, upon three several
Subjects, which were looked upon as the Principal, and most considerable
Matters belonging to the Cognizance of the Ecclesiastical Courts of this Realm:
The first concerning Wills and Testaments; The second concerning Marriages; The
third concerning Tithes; And, had he lived to have accomplished his Design, no
doubt he had cleared many Questions relating to those Matters, which at present
are not so generally known, or thoroughly understood, but labor under great
Obscurity. The first of these he lived to finish and see published; and all men
grant it to be an excellent Piece in its kind, and has acquired him no small
Fame amongst Posterity. This indeed was a Subject properly belonging to him,
and wherein he may well be supposed to be very conversant and knowing, he
having been Judge of the Prerogative Court at York for many years before he
dyed; which Place he executed with great Integrity and Applause. After his
Death his Friends Erected a fair Monument to his Memory in the Cathedral Church
of York, where he lies Interred, with this Epitaph or Inscription.

Non Viduae caruere Viris, non Patre Pupillus,
Dum stetit hic Patriae, Virque Paterque suae.
Ast, quod Swinburnus Viduarum scripsit in usum,
Longius aeterno Marmore vivet opus.
The second, concerning Marriages, he designed to have divided into three
Parts. The first whereof was to treat of Spousals; The second of Marriages; The
third of Divorces. The first of these Parts he lived to finish, as may be seen
by perusing the ensuing Treatise. But as to the two last Parts, and his Piece
of Tithes, he only left some rude Materials, not formed or digested into any
Method or Order. And it is not improbable but that they, in whose hands the
Manuscript so long remained, might think it an Injury to the Authors Memory, to
commit a Piece to the Press, which remained unfinished and imperfect, and
wanted the Authors last Hand at his Death. But though the Piece be imperfect in
respect of what the Author designed, yet this particular Tract concerning
Spousals, being absolutely finished, and the Subject very delightful and
pleasant: And considering that no Englishman (that I know of) has put forth any
thing material of this Nature before, and that there is nothing which could be
writ by such an Author, specially relating to his own Profession, but what very
well deserved to be read, and must be very enforming, I thought the publishing
of it might be very pardonable, if not obliging and grateful. And it is possible
that the printing of this Piece, may provoke and engage some ingenious Pen of
the same Profession to begin where the Learned Author left off, and happily to
finish and perfect, what he lived not to perform.

Some Persons of Critical Disposition, may perhaps censure our Author, for
being oftentimes too elaborate, and spending over much time in resolving
Questions, which at the first sight, and even to a mean Capacity may seem very
easy and trivial, and in which there can be little or no difficulty, and think
that his Style is too prolix and tedious, and that in some places he seems too
pedantick, etc. But to this I say, That the Author designed this Treatise, as
formerly he had done that of his Wills and Testaments, for the benefit and
Instruction of the meaner Sort. If he had writ for Fame and Ostentation, or for
Satisfaction of the Learned, and such as were well versed before hand in the
Profession, he knew as well as any man, how to have applied himself to them in
a more succinct and concise way, and to have talked to them in their own Terms
of Art, and such as were proper to the Profession; and this would have been
much more easy and less trouble to him; but it would have rendered the Treatise
in great measure useless to the generality of People, for whose Benefit he
chiefly intended it. And besides, many Grains of Allowance are to be given him,
in respect of the Age in which he writ, which was fuller of Affection, and far
less Polite and Accurate than the present. We find Scraps of Latin, much less
to the purpose, and much more Pedantry and Affectation used, by a Man of great
Fame and Worth in another Profession, who lived many years after our Author,
and had many more Advantages of Conversation and Improvement. And I make no
question but that the pertinency and closeness of our Author in most places,
will sufficiently compensate, and make an Atonement for his Prolixity or
Affectation in others.

The way that he used in quoting his Authority for every Point of Law that he
delivered, is fair and candid (however it may seem to some Persons superfluous)
and may be of singular use to those that study the Profession, especially to
young Practitioners, there being scarce any Question, that can occur, relating
to Spousals or Matrimonial Contracts, that is not here ingeniously debated, and
judiciously resolved; and then he that desires more ample Satisfaction, is
directed how he may consult those Authors, from whence this Judgment was drawn
and collected, and where he may find the Matter much more amply discussed, and
receive all the Satisfaction he can desire.

In short, I hope, that Care has been taken in the Impression, that the Piece
may do due Service to the Public, and no Injury to the Memory of the Author,
and that is all I aim at in the Publication.

SECT. I. Of the manifold signification and acceptance of this word Sponsalia,
Spousals, and whence it is derived.
1. ALbeit this word Sponsalia (Englished Spousals) being properly understood,
does only signify Promises of future Marriage l. 1. de Sponsal. ff. Panor. and

, yet is it not perpetually tied to this only Sense, for sometimes it is
stretched to the signification of Love Gifts and Tokens of the Parties
betroathed L. 1. C. si Nupt. ex rescript pet. l. Deo nobis C. de Epis. and

2. Our Temporal Lawyers they do usually confound these Terms of Espousals and
Marriage, using them promiscue, or one for another Fitz. Abridg. tit. Bastardy.

, yet do not they confound the Natures with the Names; for until the
Celebration of the Marriage, they do not repute the affianced Couple for one
Person, nor deem of their Issue as lawful, nor does he gain any Propriety in
her Goods, nor she any Dower in his Lands by force of the Contract of Matrimony

3. The Civilians, though seldom they use the word Spousals for Matrimony l. 1.

, but rather for a preamble or preparation thereunto Sichard. in rub. de

, deem of Spousals like as of pure and perfect Matrimony.

4. The Canonists be somewhat more diligent indeed in the Observation of Terms;
for they do not only distinguish between Matrimony and Spousals Ut per tot.
tit. de Sponsal. and Matrimoniis extra.
, but Peck. Tract. de test. conjugum, l. 4. c. 11. n. 4. l. Seia. l. cum hic

descending further, they do also discern betwixt one kind of Spousals and
another, being the first Inventors of the several Names of Spousals de futuro,
and Spousals de praesenti c. pen. de Spons. extra Covar. de Sponf. prima part
c. 1. n. 4. Schneid. Tract. de Nupt. fol. 18. Q. quot funt species.
, and yet nevertheless oftentimes they make no difference, or very little,
betwixt the Natures and Effects of Spousals de praesenti, and of Matrimony
solemnized and consummate c. Per tuas. Qui filii sunt legitimi extra. Felin. in
rub. de Spons. extra. Gl. in Clem. unic. de Consang Covar. tract. de Spons.

Sponsal. extra. ubi in favorabilibus etiam Sponsa de futuro.
.

5. Thus is this word Spousalia, Sponsals, diversely used, though properly and
naturally (as I first showed) it signifies nothing else but Promises of future
Marriage Covar. Tract. de Spons. prima part, c. 1. n. 4. Pan. in Rub. de
Spons. extra. Tiraq. de Leg. Connub. l. 14. verb. neque huic. l. oration ff. de
Sponsal.
; and it is derived of the Verb Spondeo, which is to promise l. 2. ff. de
Sponsal.
: and hence it is that the Parties betroathed or affianced (not yet married)
are called Sponsus and Sponsa, that is to say, promised, being so called
Sponsi, promised l. 3. ff. de Sponsal.
rather than Spondentes, or Sponsores, promising or promissors, because in
former Ages (as some probably do conjecture) such was the Authority of Parents,
and such the Obedience of Children, as the Parents did make Promises of their
Children's Marriage, and not the Children themselves Alciat. parerg. lib. 1. c.
2. Et spondere dicebatur Pater filiae, despondere autem Pater adolescentis.

, who neither could Hiero. Franc. in I nuptias de Reg. Jur. ff. n. 11. Alciat
ubi supra; quod verum puta, inspecto jure Civili, secus Jure Canon^o ut infra.
, neither would, without their Parents consent, presume to make any kind of
Promise concerning Marriage; much less to proceed to the actual Celebration and
Consummation of Marriage, without the Parents liking De consensu Parentium, v.
Schneid. Tract. de Nupt. fol. 36. cum seqq. and Melch. Kling Tract. de Cause.
Matrimonial. fol. 77. and infra.
, being contrary to the wicked Examples of cursed Children in these days,
thereby dishonouring their Parents, and breaking the Commandment of the
Almighty.

6. The Verb Spondeo (by the Opinion of Varro Lib. 4. de Ling. latin.
and others Rebuff. in l. munus, de Verb. Sign. ff. Wesemb. in tit. de Sponsal
ff.
, is as much as Sponte do, that is, to give freely or without constraint,
insinuating thus much, That how great soever the Authority of Parents is in
that behalf, yet the Children or Parties promised or espoused, are to give
their consent freely and voluntarily; or at least, that they are not to be
constrained thereunto against their Wills, by the rigor of covetous Parents L.

; otherwise the Contract of Spousals or Matrimony, made through fear, is
utterly void ipso jure c. 1. de Despons. Impuberum, c. cumlocum, etc. cum

.

7. Finally, whereas the word Sponsalia, Spousals, does want the singular
number, we may collect, That the single Promise Unde Vocabulum Sponsio de omni
stipulatione, premissioneque, etiam nulla interrogatiaene praevia univoce
praedicatur, L. Sponsio ff. de verb. sign. Et ibi DD. sed dictio Sponsalia
proprie sumpta, ad nuptias tantum refertur, L. 1. ff. de Sponsal.
of either Party alone does not make Spousals, as in the approaching Definition
more fully does appear.

SECT. II. The Definition of Spousals.
1. SPousals are defined after this manner, Sponsalia sunt mutua repromissio
futurarum Nuptiarum, rite inter eos, quibus jure licet, facta c. nostrates 30.
q. 5. l. 1. de Sponsal. ff. Junctis Wesemb. in eund. tit. nu. 2 and Moraldo.
Tract. de Matrim. tit. de. Sponsal. in prin.
. Spousals are a mutual Promise of future Marriage, being duly made between
those Persons, to whom it is lawful. In which definition I observe three things
especially: One, That this Promise must be mutual; Another, That it must be
done rite, duly: The last, By them to whom it is lawful.

2. First, whereas this Promise is described to be mutual, it proves that it
is not sufficient if either of the Parties alone do promise c. si inter. c. tua
nos. de Sponsal. c. debitum. de bigamis ca. de Sponsa duorum extra.
: And therefore if the Man (for Example) say to the Woman, I do promise that I
will marry thee: But the Woman does not make the like Promise to the Man; or
contrariwise, the Woman does promise, but not the Man, this is a lame Contract
(having as it were but one Leg) and so not being able to walk upright, is not
of any force in Law Praeposit. and alii in d. c. si inter. and in c. 1. de
Sponsa. duorum extra. l. 1. Consil. Matrimon. consil. ibidem 84. nu. 4. and
lib. 2. consil. ibidem 4. n. 1. and consil. 5. nu. 1. in fine. v. addit. ad
Hostiens. Sum. in fit. de Sponsal.. quot sint.
: Neither is the silent Party in this Case presumed to consent, unless the
consent appear, either by words, or at least by sufficient Conjectures Lib. 1.
Consil. Matrimon. consil. ibidem 84. nu. 6. Pan in c. tuae de Sponsal. and in
c. 1. de Despons. impub. extra. l. 2. consil. Matrimon consil. ibidem 34. n.
34. versic. 3.
. As when the Father or Mother do contract Sponsals, or promise Marriage for
their Child; for the Child's silence in this Case (being present and hearing the
same) is taken for a consent and approbation thereof c. 1.. fin. de Despons.
impub. in Sext. juncta gl. ibidem, quod tamen intellige, ut per Felin. post
Abb. in c. nonne. de praesumpt. extra n. 8.
; though it be otherwise, if any other Person than the Parents take upon him to
speak, or answer for the Party; for there the Parties silence does not prove
any consent at all Innoc. Archid. Jo. And. and Phil. Franc. in d.. fin. quorum
opinio communis est -- test Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part c. 4. nu 7.
.

3. Secondly, Whereas this Promise is to be done rite, duly, we are to consider
that this word rite being strictly understood has relation only to the
Formalities of the Act or Contract Bart. in l. 2. de inoff. test. ff. Cardin.
in Clem. Testibus. de Testibus Alciat. and Rebuff. in l. haec verba in
stipulatione. de verb. sign. ff.
; but being understood in a more ample signification, it comprehends
whatsoever is included within the compass of the word recte, namely whatsoever
does respect the Justice and Equity of the matter Lucas de Penna in l. si
quando de benis vacan. lib. 10. C. Decius in l. lecta. Si certum pet. ff. n.
22. Alciat. in candem l. nu. 27. in fine.
. In this definition it seems to comprehend both the one and the other, and
so this Promise of Marriage must not only be formal, but just and right also L.
semper de ritu Nupt. ff.
.

4. Concerning the Form, so precise were the ancient Romans in the observation
thereof, that they did not for a long time admit any other manner of
contracting Spousals, but by stipulation L. 2. de Sponsal. ff. Anto. Gubert.
Tract. de Sponsal. c. 2.
; that is to say, by a certain conception of words consisting of Question and
Answer Inst. de verb. Oblig. in prin. Spiegel. Lexic. verb. Stipulatio.
: For Example, The one Party asking, Will thou marry me? The other answering, I
will Sichard. in Rub. de Spons. C. nu. 9.
. Nevertheless, forasmuch as it is the Consent alone of the Parties whereby
this Knot is tied, and whereby this Desponsation or Affiance is sufficiently
wrought L. 4. de Sponsal. ff. c. sufficiat. 27. q. 2. c. cum apud de Sponsal.

, being the very Substance (and as it were the Life and Soul) of this Contract
d. l. 4. de Sponsal. ff. and ibi DD. Summa Host. tit. de Matrimonio. qualiter
paulo post prin. Socin. consil. 28. vol. 1.
; therefore the necessity of observing that former prescript Form of
Stipulation was not without just Cause abolished (p), and liberty granted to
contract Spousals by whatsoever form of words Summa Host. de Sponsal..

whereby this mutual Consent might appear; and so at this present, there is no
one Form of Desponsation more lawful than another, but it is sufficient if the
Consent of the Parties do appear by any form L. suff. cit. ff. de Sponsal.

rite so far) Dec. and Alciat. in l. lecta. Sicert. pet. ff. Lucas de Penna in

6. Thirdly, By these words of the Definition [inter eos, quibus Jure licet,
facta] made between those Parties to whom it is lawful, we may easily collect,
That it is not lawful for every person to contract Spousals, namely, not for
Infants before they be Seven years old L. in Sponsal. ff. de Sponsal. c.

, with many Persons more ranged in a more ample Field than is here allowed to
conduct them.

7. There be other words in the Definition, viz. [futurarum Nuptiarum] of
future Marriage, in which words both the Matter and the End of the Spousals are
comprised. c. l. 29. q. l. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 3.. 7.
Reusner. de Spons. q. 5.
The Matter of Spousals is nothing else but Marriage Wesemb. in tit. de
Sponsal. ff. nu. 5.
: The End, that by Solemnization of the promised Marriage the Parties
betroathed may become perfect Husband and Wife Wesemb. eodem loco, n. 7.
. Of which Marriage, with the Causes, Effects, and Impediments, because there
follows a several Discourse, I shall not now need to dwell any longer in this
definition.

SECT. III. The division of Spousals.
1. FIrst and principally Spousals be either de futuro, of that which is to
come, or else de praesenti, of that which is present c. si inter etc. pen. de
Sponsal. extra.
: Spousals de futuro are a mutual Promise or Covenant of Marriage to be had
afterward Wesemb. in tit. de Spons. ff. Jo. Frigeus Tract. de Spons. in fine.
Inst. fol. 272.
: As when the Man says to the Woman, [I will take thee to my Wife] and she
then answers, [I will take thee to my Husband c. is qui fidem, c. si inter de
Sponsal. extra. Kling. Tract. de Causis Matrimonial. in prin. Schneid. Tract.
de Nuptiis, fol. 18. nu. 5.
]. Spousals de praesenti are a mutual Promise or Contract of present Matrimony
Wesemb. tit. de Sponsal. ff. Jo. Frigeus. Tract. de Spons. in finc. Inst. fol.
273.
; as when the man does say to the Woman [I do take thee to my Wife] and she
then answers [ I do take thee to my Husband c. pen. de Spons. extra, and ibi
omnes DD. Covar. Tract. de Spons. secunda part, c. 4.. 1. in prin.
].

2. But here methinks some man does pull me by the sleeve, and tell me in my
Ear. That this distinction fights with the former definition of Spousals,
because if Spousals be only futurarum Naptiarum repromissio, a Promise of
future Marriage l. 1. de Spons. ff.
, it cannot abide Spousals de praesenti, being a Covenant of present Matrimony
Wesemb. tit. de Spons. ff. nu. 3. Kling. Tract. de Causis Matrimon. fol. 6.
: And therefore either the definition is insufficient, comprehending only
Spousals de futuro, or if it be perfect, it destroys this member of Spousals
de praesenti Huc pertin^t quod Scriptum reliquit. And. Gail. lib. 2. obs. 80.
nu. 5.
.

3. To this Objection I answer thus: True it is, that Spousals de praesenti are
improperly called Spousals Jo. Frigeus. Tract. ^ Spons. in fine. ^st. fol. 274.
Pan. and Felin. in Rub. de Spons. extra. and in c. 3. de praesump.
, being in nature and substance, rather Matrimony than Spousals c. penult. de
Spons. extra, c. ex part. Qui fill. sunt legitimi. and Pan. in d.c. pen. Peck.
Tract. de testam. conjugum lib. 4 c. 11. nu. 1 Schneid. Tract. de Nupt. fol.
21. nu. 19. Melch. Kling. Tract. de Causis Matrim. fol. 8. Moraldus Tract. de
Matrimonio, f. 29.
: Nor was this distinction known to the Makers of the Civil Law Schneid. Tract.
de Nupt. fol. 18. Q. Quot species nu. 3. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. prima part,
c. 1. nu. 4.
, nor to Frontonius, who first devised the definition of Spousals above One
thousand years ago Frontonius l. 1. de Sponsal. ff. Frontonius autem floruit
long ante Justinianum, qui anno post natum Christum, 536. edidit librum
Digestorum, in quo extat haec definitio.
, but invented since by the Canonists Schneid. d. fol. 18. c. pen. de Spons.
extra. and ibi Pan. Olden. de Spons. fol. --
. And yet nevertheless (if we will be patient) there is no such enmity or
disagreement betwixt that definition, and this distinction, but that they may
be reconciled: For this word Nuptiae, Marriages, is not evermore referred to
the Substance and indissoluble Knot of Matrimony only Spiegel. Lexic. verb.
Nupt. l. 1. de ritu Nupt. ff.
, but does often signify the Rites and Ceremonies observed at the Celebration
of Matrimony only c. nec illud 30. q. 5. Genes. c. 24. v. 66. Imo ut diversa
non rare ponuntur Nuptiae and Matrimonium, Wesemb. tit de ritu Nupt. ff. nu. 1.
Add Rebuff. in l. pronunciatum.. Matrem familias, ff. de verb. sign.
, which thing being true, then is it not false, that seeing a man may contract
present Matrimony, and yet refer the Solemnization thereof till another time,
in respect of this future Solemnization; The Contract de praesenti may justly
be defended and verified to be futurarum Nuptiarum repromissio, a promise of
future Marriage Panor. and alii in d. c. pen de Sponsal. extra. Palaeot. de
Noth. and Spur. c. 5.
.

4. Secondly of Spousals, some be pure and simple, and some conditional Tit de
condic. appos. in Despons. Summa Hostiens. eodem tit. Merich. Kling. Tract de
cause. Matrimon. fol. 3. and Frigeus. ubi supra. Reusner. de Sponsal. q. 2.
. Pure or simple Spousals be they, wherein is no Condition: As, [I take thee to
my Wife] [I take thee to my Husband,] etc. Frigeus de Sponsal. (...) 75. Pan.
in (...) super co. de (...)ic. appos. extra. Schne. d. Iract. de Nupt. fol. 26.
Summa Sylvest. verb. Sponsalia q. 5.
. Conditional Spousals are they whereunto some such Quality is annexed, as
thereby the validity of the Contract is suspended or stayed; as, [I will marry
thee if my Father consent] etc. c. super eo. de condic. appos. extra. and ibi
Pan. and Praepos. Covar. Tract. de Spons. se cunda part, c. 3. in prin.
Frigeus and Schneid. ubi supra.
. Unto which distinction it may be added, that some Spousals be referred to a
day; as, [ I will marry thee before the first day of May c. sicut de. Sponsal
extra. and ibi Pan. and alii.
].

5. Thirdly, Spousals be contracted either betwixt them which be present, or
betwixt them that be absent Melch. Kling. Tract de causis Matrimon. fol. 1. and
2. Covar. Tract. de Spons. secunda part c. 4. nu. 8. c. f. nal. de procurat.

. Absent, when the one Party does neither see, nor hear, nor apprehend the
other with any Sense, but are espoused by intercession or mediation of a third
person Melch. Kling. fol. 2. Sum. Hostiens. tit. de Spons.. qualiter.

6. Fourthly, Spousals be either public or private Tit. de Cland. despons.

7. Fifthly, Of Spousals, some are contracted by Words, and some by Signs Pan.

8. Finally, Of Spousals, some be sworn and some unsworn; that is to say, some
Spousals be confirmed by an Oath c. 2. etc. c. requisivit. de Spons. extra.
, and some contracted without an Oath Kling. Tract. de Cause. Matrim. sol. 3.

SECT. IV. Of the great importance of the first Division or Distinction betwixt
Spousals de futuro and Spousals de praesenti.
1. WHen we shall view the small difference betwixt those words, whereby
Spousals de futuro, or de praesenti De quibus (infra) eadem part.
are contracted, it cannot but seem strange that from so small difference of
Forms, so great diversity of Effects should proceed: For in truth, so very
little (very often) is the odds betwixt the Form of words of these two
Contracts, that the best Learned are at greatest variance, whether such Words
make Spousals de futuro, or de praesenti DD. in c. ex literis, etc. ex part de
Sponsal. extra. Covar. Tract. de Spons. secunda part, c. 4.. 1.
. Neither is it unknown to the youngest Students in this Faculty, That words of
future time do not evermore import Spousals de futuro c. ex part de Sponsal.
extra. and ibi Pan. Soarez. Thesaur. Com. op. verb. Matrimonium, nu. 9.
; neither words of present time always Spousals de praesenti Veluti, si duo
impuberes Matrimonium per verba de praesenti contraxerint, c. de illis etc.

Praepos. nu. 4. c. unic.. 1. de despons. impub. in Sext. and ibidem Geminianus
and Francus, Add dec. in l. Nuptias de Reg. Jur. ff.
. Again, That some words are so untoward, that it is a question whether they
make any kind of Spousals at all Praepos. in c. ex literis de Spons. nu. 4. and
5. Covar. Tract. de Spons. s^^nda part, c. 4.. 1. nu. 6. and 7. Sum. Angelica.
verb Matrimonium q. 2. nu. 13. Praepos. in d. c. ex part, nu. 8. and infra
eadem part.
; and contrariwise, some words so flexible, that they may easily be stretched
to make, either the one, or the other Summa Hostiens. tit. de Matrimonio..
qualiter. Vivius Thesaur. com. op. verb. Matrimonium.
. And finally, that some have utterly condemned this great diversity, which
others do admit betwixt [I will] and [I do] Martinus Lutherus, Libell. de cause.
Matrimon. Schneid. Tract. de Nupt. fol. 19. Jo. Frigeus de Sponsal. fol. 274.
in fine. Instit. lib. 2. Consil. Matrimonial. consil. 1.
, as captious, and the Mother of many Quarrels; the rather, for that the ruder
sort, not being able to discern the force of Terms, are either snared or
intrapped themselves, or deceived of that they verily expected of others
Schneid. post. Luther. ubi supra. and Jo. Frigeus fol. 274. lib. 2. Consil.
Matrimon. confil. ibidem. 1.
.

2. But yet for all this, least this distinction betwixt Spousals de futuro,
and Spousals de praesenti (most commonly received throughout all Christendom,
and which all the Consistories in England do still retain) might, in any man's
opinion, seem to be of no less importance, than it is, or not so much regarded
as it ought, I thought it convenient, e're I did proceed any further, to
deliver some different Effects of importance betwixt these two kinds of
Spousals, to remove this erroneous Conceit: Understand therefore, that that
man and that woman, which do contract Spousals de futuro, as [I will take thee
to my Wife; I will take thee to my Husband] are not very Husband and Wife c.
requisivit c. si inter de Spons. extra. Pan: and Felin. in rub. de Spons.
extra. quibus (si placeat) adjungas. Theod. Bez. Tract. de divorc. in prin.
post. Lateranense consilium part. 6. c.
, neither so reputed in Law l. in eo Jure. hoc caput. ff. de ritu Nupt. l.
solet.. ult. ff. de his qui not. infam. c. 2. requisivit de Sponsal. extra.
, except in certain Cases hereafter expressed Infra eadem part. 17.
, which excepted, they may by mutual agreement dissolve those Spousals, and
safely match themselves elsewhere c. 2. de Spousal. extra. etc. requisivit
eodem. Summa Host. tit. de Spons.. ult. verse. Item 3.
; or if but the one of them alone shall renounce, and thereupon adventure indeed
to marry otherwise, or to contract Spousals de praesenti with some other
Person, in these Cases, by the Laws Civil l. 1. de Sponsal. C.
and Ecclesiastical c. sicut. c. si inter. de Spons. extra.
, this Marriage or Contract de praesenti shall stand firm and lawful,
notwithstanding that Precontract of Spousals de futuro: The reason is, because,
like as when a man does promise, that he will sell his Land, the Land is not
there by sold in deed, but promised to be sold afterward Gl. in l. ementis C.
de contrahend. empt. Jas. and alii in l. servi electione de Legate. 1. ff.
; so whiles the Parties do promise only, that they will take, or will marry;
they do not thereby presently take or marry Melch. Kling. Tract. de cause.
Matrimon. fol. 1. Pan. and alii in c. ex literis el. 1. de Spons. extra.
: But deferring the accomplishment of that promise, until another time, the
Knot in the mean time is not so surely tied, but that it may be loosed, whiles
the matter is in suspense and unperfect c. praeterea c. requisivit de Spons.
extra.
. But that woman, and that man, which have contracted Spousals de praesenti;
as, [I do take thee to my Wife] and [I do take thee to my Husband] cannot by
any Agreement dissolve those Spousals, but are reputed for very Husband and
Wife in respect of the Substance, and indissoluble Knot of Matrimony c. Conjux.

3. The reason is, because here is no Promise of any future Act, but a present

4. Worthily therefore was that Branch of the Statute of noble King Henry the
Eighth Anno 32. c. 38
, establishing, [ That Marriages contracted and solemnized in the Face of the
Church, and consummate with bodily knowledge, or Matthew. c. 1. versic. 18. Luc.
c. 1. verse. 27. desponsata quidem sed per verba de praesenti, Gl. in d. c.
inventa.
fruit of Child or Children, should be judged and taken for lawful and
indissoluble, notwithstanding any Precontract of Matrimony, not yet consummate
with bodily knowledge, etc.] worthily, I say, and upon good ground was this
Branch of that Statute (established by the Father) repealed and made void by
his gracious Son King Edward the Sixth Anno 2. c. 23.
, for Spousals de praesenti, though not consummate, be in truth and substance
very Matrimony l. Nuptias de Reg. Jur. ff. lib. 1. consil. Matrimon. consil.
ibidem 5. nu. 2. Reusner. lib. 1. de cause. Matrimon. q. 2. nu. 9, 10. and nu.
35, 36, and 37.
, and therefore perpetually indissoluble c. fi inter. de Sponsal. c. 1. de
Sponsa duorum extra.
, except for Adultery c. Praecepit Dominus 32. q. 5. c. quemadmodum. De Jure
jur. extra.
: Although by the Common Laws of this Realm (like as it is in France and other
places) Spousals not only de futuro, but also de praesenti be destitute of many
legal Effects wherewith Marriage solemnized does abound, whether we respect
legitimation of Issue, alteration of property in her Goods, or right of Dower
in the Husbands Lands.

SECT. V. What Persons may contract Spousals de futuro.
1. SInce it appears that the distinction betwixt Spousals de futuro and de
praesenti, is not an idle distinction, or to little purpose, but of very great
use, and no less importance, we are now to descend somewhat lower, and to
prosecute either kind of Spousals severally and particularly.

2. Wherefore beginning with Spousals de futuro, let us examine first, What
Persons may contract Spousals de futuro Infra eadem. and Paragraphis seqq.
: Next by what Form of words this kind of Spousals is contracted Infra eadem
part. 10.
: Thirdly, what are the Effects thereof Infra eadem part,. 17.
: And fourthly, by what means the same may be dissolved Infra eadem part,. 18.
.

3. Concerning the Persons I find two Rules, the one Affirmative, the other
Negative: The Affirmative Rule is this, What Persons soever may contract
Matrimony, the same Person may contract Spousals de futuro Ho^^ens Summa tit.
de Spons.. quis possit. Sichard. in Rub. de Spons. C. nu. 15. Summa
Sylvestrina. verb. Sponsalia. q. 2.
. But every Person which has discretion to consent, and therewithal to perform
the duty of Marriage, may contract Matrimony Summa Hostiens. tit. de Matrim.
quis possit.
, if otherwise he be not prohibited Hostiens. ubi supra.
; and therefore every such Person may lawfully contract Spousals: which Rule is
very reasonable, being put affirmatively, because to whom that is lawful which
is great, that which is less, is much more lawful: Now it is a greater matter
to contract Matrimony than Spousals, for by lawful Marriage the Knot is made
for ever indissoluble Quod Deus conjunxit homo ne separet. Marc. c. 10. verse. 9.
; but Spousals are many ways subject to overthrow and dissolution Kling. Tract.
de cause. Matrim. fol. 5. Praepos. in c. de illis de Spons. extra. in fine. lib.
1. consil. Matrim. consil. ibidem 15. nu. 11.
. Marriage was ordained of God in Paradise Genes. c. 2. verse. 21, 22, 23, 24.
, Spousals long after by Man Anto. Gubert. Tract. de Spons. fol. 7. nu. 4.
Exodus c. 22. v. 16. Deuteronomy. c. 22. verse. 28.
: By Marriage the Man and the Woman are made one Flesh Genes. c. 2. in fine.
Epist. ad Ephesians. c. 5. verse. 31.
, so are they not by only Spousals c. Institutum 27. q. 32.
. To be short, Marriage is that great Mystery representing that Spiritual
Marriage betwixt Christ and his Church Epist. ad Ephesians. c. 5.32.
; but Spousals are utterly destitute of this mystical Effect c. Institutum 2^.
q. 2. Praepos. in c. 1. de Spons. duorum, nu. 1. Anto. Gubert. Tract. de Spons.
fol. 43.
: And therefore since Marriage is greater than Spousals, it follows by a
sound Argument a majori ad minus Everard, and Olden. Loco a Maj. ad minus.
, That those c. cui de Reg. Jur. in Sexr.
Persons which may contract Matrimony, may also contract Spousals.

4. The Rule Negative is, That whosoever is prohibited to contract Matrimony,
the same Person is also prohibited to contract Spousals l. Oration de Spons. ff.
and ibi Bald. and alii.
; because where the End is forbidden, there the Means also, whereby the End may
be achieved, is prohibited c. cum quod de Reg. Jur. in Sext. Bart. in d. l.
Oration.
; which Reason might be illuminated with sundry Examples Din. Phil. Franc. and
Peck. in d. c. cum quod.
; but for that this Negative Rule has sundry apparent Fallacies Sichard. in
rub. de Spons. C. nu. 15, 16. etc. Addit. ad Bart. in l. Oration de Spons. ff.
, I will not strive to make it seem infallible, let this one suffice, namely,
That Children cannot contract Matrimony l. minorem ff. de ritu nuptiarum, c
puberes. etc. de illis de despons. impuberum extra. vivius lib. 2. consil.
matrim. fol. 209. col. 1.
, and yet may contract Spousals de futuro c. a nobis de despons. impuber.
extra. etc. fin. ibidem. Anto. Gubert. tract. de sponsal. fol. 21. nu. 7.
. And now because indeed this is the chief and principal Exception of this
Rule, I think it here convenient to entreat of the Age wherein Spousals de
futuro may be contracted.

SECT. VI. Of Spousals contracted by Infants.
1. THere be three Ages considerable in this Matter of Spousals Host. Sum. tit.
de despons. impub.. quis dicatur.
: The first is Infancy c. 1. de despons. impub. lib. 6. and Host. ubi supra.
: The second is the Age between Infancy and ripe Age eodem c.. 1. and Host. ubi
supra.
, (which, if it please you, we will call Childhood): The third is ripe Age
eodem c.. ult. and Host. ubi supra.
.

2. Concerning the first Age, this Rule is delivered both by the Civil l. in
Sponsal. and l. 2. de Sponsal. ff.
and Canon Laws c. 1. de despons. impub. lib. 6.
, That Infants cannot contract any kind of Spousals: Upon which Conclusion,
diverse, as well Ampliations as Limitations, do attend ut infra hoc ipso.
. But before they be admitted into presence, it shall not be unprofitable to
examine what Persons be accounted Infants.

3. By Infants therefore, if we respect the Nature of the word, are understood
those Younglings and Babes which as yet cannot speak Calepin. verb. infans.

, because until that time they are as it were Tongue-tied, being unable to
speak, at least effectually; and though they speak naturally, yet do not the
Laws understand, or acknowledge their words to be of any force, either for
Alienations or other Contracts, more than if they were young Infants, naturally
destitute both of Speech and Judgment Dr. and Stud. nbi supra cui add Spiegel.

, he that is Heir, though otherwise he be of lawful years, and how old soever,
yet so long as he yet lives, to whom he is Heir (as the Son during the
Father's Life, or the younger Brother during the Life of the Elder) is usually
called Insant Spiegel. Lexic. verb. Infans. and Rebuff. ubi supra.
, because he has no power to meddle with the Inheritance, the Laws having set
a Lock before his Lips, so that he is not to speak in these Affairs, the Care

attributed not to Men alone, but to Beasts also Calepin. Lexic. verb. Infans.

Laws, by Infants (most commonly) are understood those Children which have not
as yet accomplished the Age of Seven years; and so is the word accepted in this
place l. in Sponsalibus, el. 2. de Spons. ff. c. 1. de despons. impub. in Sext.
.

8. Wherefore to return to the right Path of our purposed Journey, where it is
delivered, That Infants cannot contract Spousals; it is understood of those
Children which be under the Age of Seven years c. Juvenis. de Sponsal. c. ad
literas de despons impub. extra. etc. 1. eodem tit. lib. 6. and ibi DD.
: They therefore which are not Seven years old cannot contract Spousals; which
Conclusion has so much the more Reason, by how much these young Infants want
Reason and Judgment to judge of these Affairs l. i. C. de falls. monet. l.
Infans. ff. ad l. Corneliam de Sicar.
, being fitly compared to them which are asleep Clem. de homicid. and ibidem DD.
; who albeit they speak many things, or do something in their sleep, yet do
they not perceive what they say or do, nor sleeping yield their consent thereto
d. Clem. Zaf. in l. possessio. adipiscantur in fin. de acquir. poss. ff.
.

9. The Ampliations and Limitations of which Rule are these: First, albeit the
one Party be above the Age of Seven years, yet the other Party being under
Seven years, the contract of Spousals betwixt those two, is of so small force,
that if the Party which is of full Age, do contract Matrimony with a third
Person, though that third Person be near of Kin to the Infant, the Marriage is
good, notwithstanding the former Contract c. literas. c. accessit. de despon.
impub. gl. in c. Juvenis. de Sponsal. extra, and ibi Panor. Praepos. and alii.
.

10. Secondly, Albeit the Infants have attained to the Seventh year of their
several Ages, yet are those Spousals void d.c. literas, cum c. seq. Anto.
Gubert. tract. de Sponsal. fol. 19. nu. 1.
; for it is requisite that they have wholly and fully accomplished the Seventh
year when they do contract Spousals; at least, saving for two or three days
Pan. in d. c. literas nu. 3. Praepos. nu. 2. Covar. tract. de Sponsal. prima
part, c. 2. nu. 2. Henr. Boic: in c. accessit, and in c. attestationes. de
despons. impub. extra.
.

11. Thirdly, Spousals contracted during Infancy are utterly void, whether the
Infants themselves, or their Parents for them, do make the Contract c. 1. de
despons. impub. lib. 6. and ibidem Domin. nu. 2. in prin.
.

12. Fourthly, Albeit both the Infants after the Contract do attain to a great
number of years, yet the Spousals contracted during their Infancy are not
thereby confirmed Praeall. c. unic de despons. impub. and gl. lib. 6. etc.
literas de despons. extra.
, without other proof of mutual Confirmation eodem c. in prin. Covar. tract. de
Sponsal prima part, c. 2. in fin.
.

13. Fifthly, The Contract made during Infancy is void, whether the Contract
were celebrated by words of present time, as [ I do take thee, etc.] or by
words of future time, as [ I will take thee, etc.] Jo. And. in c. unic. de
despons. impub. in Sext.
; for as Infants cannot contract Spousals, so they cannot Matrimony c. ubi etc.
puberes de despons. imp. extra cum Similibus, and Pan. in d. c. ubi.
, because they which cannot do the lesser, cannot do the greater Peckius in c.
cui licet de Reg. Jur. in Scat. Everard. loco a minori.
.

14. The Limitations are these; First when the Infants, after they have
accomplished their several Ages of Seven years, do either by express word
ratify c. 1. de despons. impub. in Sexto in prin.
and confirm the Contract made during their Infancy, or by other words of like
importance, as by calling and naming each other Husband and Wife gl. in d. c. 1.
; for by the reason of this new consent the Contract (otherwise void) is become
of no less force than if they had new made a new Contract Anto. Gubert. Tract.
de Sponsal. fol. 20. nu. 3.
.

15. The second Limitation is when as by Deeds only they do approve and confirm
the Contract made during their Infancies c. unic. de Sponsal. lib. 6. in prin.
Covar. tract. de Spons. prima part c. 2 in fine.
, as if they lie together, embrace, or kiss each other, or give and receive
Gifts and Tokens either of them, to or from the other, after both their Ages of
Seven years; for by Deeds the former Spousals are confirmed, as well as by
Words Covar. tract. de Sponsal. prima part, c. 2. in fine, and glos. ubi
supra. pro c. dilecti etc. ut nostram. de App. extra.
.

16. The third Limitation (like unto the second) is, when the Infants, after
the accomplishment of their said several Ages, do mutually cohabit or dwell
together c. unic. de despons. impub. in princ. lib. 6.
, and are not ignorant of the Contract made betwixt Glos. in d c. unic. ibi,
vel facto quam sequitur Domini. and Phil. Perus. Baptist. Thesaur. com. op.
verb. Sponsalia nu. 92. Licet Hostiens in diversam eat Sententiam.
them, during their Infancy; for otherwise they do not ratify that which they
know not Dominic. and Phil. Franc. in d. c.
.

17. The fourth Limitation is, when two contract Spousals, of whom the one is
more than Seven years old, the other near Seven years c Juvenis de Sponsal.
extra.
, suppose six and a half Jo And. Host. Praepos. and alii communiter in d. c
Juvenis.
; if these Persons ever, during the Infancy of the younger Party, do either lie
together Host. d. c Juvenis and ibi Praepos. verb. tertius Intelle^^^s.
, or cohabit together Card and Panor. in d. c. Ju venis and ibi Praepos. verb.
quartus Intellectus.
, by occasion whereof it remains doubtful, whether they have essayed to know
each other; in this Case the Contract has like effect as if the Parties had
both accomplished the Age of Seven years d. c. Juvenis and ibi DD.
.

18. The fifth Limitation is, when the Infants which do contract Spousals are
of that Wit and Discretion, that albeit they have not as yet accomplished the
full Age of Seven years, yet does their supraordinary Understanding fully
supply that small defect of Age, which thing is not rare in these days, wherein
Children become sooner ripe, and do conceive more quickly than in former Ages
Damhouder. pract. Criminal. c. 84. nu. 5.
: Wherefore in this Case, by that Opinion which savoureth more of Equity Dom
Anto. in d. c. Juvenis and ibi Pan. in fin.
, and which (as I take it) is more commonly received Sum. Hostiens. tit. de

Sylvest. de Sponsal. q. 2. Covar. de Sponsal. prima part, c. 2. nu. 1. quorum
opinio communis est, ut ex eisdem Author. patet.
, this Contract is not void, but of equal force as if these Infants had
out-grown their Infancy when they were Espoused. I confess this Opinion has
many and mighty Adversaries Panor. in d. c. Juvenis, Socin. Sen. cons. 3. vol.
1. gl. in Inst. Juris Can. tit. de Sponsal.. non tamen verb. minores.
, affirming confidently, That it cannot be proved by Law, that Infants may
contract Spousals before the end of Seven years, though otherwise their
Prudence did supply the want of Age Panor. in d. c. Juvenis in fin.
. But yet for all this, considering that by the very Text of the Law, not only
(after the accomplishment of those numbers of years, severally prescribed to
the Man and Woman for Marriage, he or she may lawfully contract Matrimony, but
also before those years, in case their natural Abilities supply the want of Age
c. puberes c. de illis. de despons. Impub. extra. and ibi DD. Kling. tract. de
cause. matrim. fol. 15. Guber. Costan. tract. de matr. fol. 66. nu. 15, 16, etc.
, that is, suffice to perform the Duty of Marriage Panor. in c. de illis. el.
2. nu. 3. Kling and Costan. ubi supra.
, then a fortiori (by all reason) may those Persons contract Spousals, whose
Prudence does supply the other want of Age Praepos. and communiter DD. in d. c.
Juvenis. Covar. tract. de Spons. prima part, c. 2. Summa Sylvest. tit. de
Sponsal. q. 2.
, both because Spousals are more easily dissolved than Matrimony Schneid.
tract. de nupt. fol. Melch. Kling. tract. de cause. matrim. fol. 6. Summa
Hostiens. de Sponsal.. ult.
, in case of the Parties disliking, as also because consent alone is of the
Substance of Spousals, without that natural Ability requisite in Marriage l.
sufficit. de Sponsal ff Sum. Sylvest. tit. de Sponsal. q. 2.
: Hence it is that the Laws make no difference betwixt their Ages who do
contract Spousals, namely, because consent alone is sufficient Ant. Gubert.
tract. de Sponsal. fol. 21. n. 6. Faber. and Angel. in. 1. Inst. de nupt.
; whereas in the Contract of Marriages there is regard had, not only of the
Parties Judgment and Understanding, but also of the natural Ability of their
Bodies c. puberes, c. de illis. cum Similibus de despons. impub. extra.
, as a thing very necessary in that behalf DD. in d. c. puberes. etc. de illis.
Covar. de Spons. prima part, c. 2.
.

19. Here may be demanded, What if two Infants contracting Spousals by words of
present time, do not only confirm the same after that they have overpassed
their Infancy, but also after they be come to lawful years of Marriage, whether
is this Contract to be adjudged more Spousals or Matrimony? In this Question
the Writers do vary Jo. Andr. Archid. Phil. Franc. and alii. in c. 1.. 1. de
despons. impub. l. 6. Decis. Rotae. 463.
, and it depends of other Points to be examined before we can conveniently
come to the Solution, which cannot be here handled without confusion; but as
soon as opportunity serves it shall be satisfied.

SECT. VII. Of Spousals contracted by Children betwixt Infancy and ripe Age.
1. THe second Age to be regarded in Persons contracting Spousals is Childhood,
which Age how far it reaches is needful to be known: Children therefore, in
respect of their Age, are so termed of some, until they be twice Seven years
old Aristot. Histor. Animal. lib. 5. c. 14. Macrob. de quo Alciat. in l. pueri
de Verb. Sign. ff. Anto. Gubert. tract. de matr. fol. 67.
; of some till they be thrice Seven years old, that is One and twenty Tract. de
repub. Angl. lib. 3. c. 5. and Alciat. post Macrob. ubi supra.
, sometimes Children are so called until they be of the Age of Two and twenty
years l. 1. Pueri ff. de postulando, Servius Tullus Rex Romans de quo Aul. Gel.
lib. 10. c. 28.
, sometimes until they be of the Age of Eighteen l. mella. ff. de alimen. leg.
, sometimes nutil they be Twenty Rebuff. in l. Pueri de Verb. Sign. ff. versic.
quinto non tenentur.
, and sometimes till they be Five and twenty tit. de minor. vigint. quinque
ann. ff. l. impuberibus, de acquir. hered. ff. and ibi gl. secundo Intellectum.
, according to the variety of the subjected Matter and Meaning of the Author
Alciatus Rebuff. and Bracheus in l. Pueri ff. de Verb. Sign.
. In the holy Scriptures we read, Puer centum annorum morietur Esaias c. 65.
verse. 20.
; that is, a Child of an hundred years shall dye, if we translate it after the
Letter.

2. By Children in this place, I understand them which have exceeded their
Infancy, but have not as yet attained to that Age wherein nature (by the
Providence of God) bestows Corporal Ability of performing the Act of
Generation c. Puberes. de despons. impub. extra. and DD. ibidem.
; these Children the Laws Civil and Ecclesiastical, do call Impuberes Alciat.
in I. Pueri. de Verb. Sign. ff. Spiegel. Lexic. verb. Impuberes. and verb.
Pueri. Instit. quibus. mod. Tutel. sin. 1.
, as it were young Plants, without Buds or Blossoms, being the outward Signs of
inward Vigor Unde pubescere, id est, lanuginem circa pudenda emittere. Praepos.
and alii in d. c. puberes.
, and they are also called Pueri, as some conjecture quasi puri Alciat. in d.
L. Pueri. ff. de Verb. Sign. Spiegel. Lexic. verb. Pueri.
, that is, pure, or as Virgins clean from Carnal Pollution: But whether Pueri
have their denomination a puritate, I will not contend: I remember Brechaeus
jeasting at this Etymology, affirms, That by the same Reason we might say
purus quasi purus aer Brech. in d. L. Pueri in principio.
; but let the names go, and come we to the thing it self, Pueritia, Childhood
is the Age betwixt Infancy and ripe Age fit for Marriage Hostiens. Summa Tit.
de despons. impub.. quis dicatur Impubes and DD. in d. c. puberes.
.

3. During this Age Children cannot contract Matrimony or Spousals de
praesenti, but only de futuro c. de illis el. 1. and DD. ibidem. Summa
Hostiens. Tit. de despons. impub. and quae Sponsalia. Hen. Boic. in c. puberes
de despons. impub. extra.
, which excellent Conclusion is not only adorned with sundry Limitations of
Importance, but enriched with many profitable Questions.

4. The first Limitation is pro bono pacis, for the good or benefit of Peace c.
ubi de despons. impub. extra.
, and therefore if two Princes, after long or cruel Wars, concluding a friendly
Peace, do for more assured confirmation thereof match their Children in
Marriage, this Marriage the Laws do tolerate as lawful, being made upon such
urgent Cause, though otherwise for diverse wants the same were unlawful d. c.
ubi and ibidem DD.
.

5. The second Limitation is Quando malitia supplet aetatem, that is, when
natural Ability to pay the Marriage Debt does supply the want of Age c. de
illis el. 2. de despons. impub. extra, latius infra.
, for so this word malitia does signify in this place Al. in Praeal. c. nu. 3.
Archid. in c. unic. de despons. impub. in Sext. Kling. Tract. de cause.
matrimonial. fol. 15. Gubertus Costan. Tract. de matrimon. fol. 76. nu. 50.
: But wherefore it does so signify, I cannot, as yet, perfectly apprehend, no
more than wherefore our Temporal Lawyers use this word [mulier] (which does
signify a woman which is not a Virgin) for one that is Legitimate, or that is
not a Bastard Terms of Law. verb. Mulier.
; it suffices we know the meaning, which is, That albeit the Laws do not
presume any Man or Woman to be able to perform the Act of Generation, until a
certain number of years (hereafter described) be accomplished Instit. quib.
mod. Tutel. fin.. 1. l. minorem de ritu nup. ff. Gubert. Costan. Tract. de
matrimon. fol. 66. nu. 15. Summa Hostiens. Tit. de despons. impub.. quis
dicatur. nu. 1. Henric. Boic. in c. puberes. codem Tit.
: Nevertheless if it do appear, that in the mean time, and before the
expiration of those years, they are able to perform the Act aforesaid, then it
is lawful for them to contract Spousals de praesenti, or to marry c. puberes c.
de illis el. 2. c. a nobis. de despons. impub. extra. Hostiens. Summa tit. de
despons. impub.. quis dicatur. Panor. and Praepositus in d. c. puberes.
.

6. Thirdly, Albeit Children cannot contract Spousals de praesenti so
effectually, that the same shall enjoy the very force and virtue proper
thereunto, yet observing the form of Spousals de praesenti in their Contract,
as [ I do take thee to my Husband, I do take thee to my Wife, etc.] this
Contract is not utterly void, but by the Interpretation of Law, obtains the
force of Spousals de futuro c. unic.. 1. de despons. impub. in Sext.
: Diverse (I deny not) of the Ancient Lawyers were of a contrary Opinion for a
long time Viv. in c. a nobis. de despons. impub. and alii de quibus Hen. Foic.
cod. c. and Hostiens. Summa Tit de despons. impub.. and quae Sponsalia. Bart.
in L. prima. Si quis ita; de verb. Obl. ff. nu. 2.
, holding, That if by these words the Parties did intend to contract Matrimony,
then the Contract was utterly void, not having any force either of Matrimony or
of Spousals gloss. post. Alan. in d. c. a nobis and disputat. Hen. Poic. eod. c.
: Not of Matrimony, because if they would, they could not make any such
Contract gloss. in d. c. a nobis. and in c. unic.. 1. verb. Matrimonrum.
: Not of Spousals, because albeit they might, yet they did not intend to make
any such Contract Gloss. ubi supra and resert Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. part
1. c. 3. nu. 2. quem vide.
: And so either because they could not, or would not, the Contract did not
prevail at all, either as Matrimony, or as Spousals; howbeit in the end this
Opinion was dashed by later Laws made for that purpose, whereby it was and is
established, That if two Children do contract Spousals by words of present
time, intending also thereby to contract Matrimony, yet this Contract shall
prevail as Spousals de futuro Text. in c unic.. 1. de despons. impub. in Sext.
Hen. Boic. in d. c. a nobis extra eod. tit. and Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. prima
part c. 3. nu. 2.
; and so it is if one of the Parties be of ripe Age, the other not d.c. unic..
1. de despons. impub. in Sext.
.

7. Fourthly, By what means Spousals contracted during Infancy, and therefore
void at the beginning, are notwithstanding afterward made strong and
confirmed, namely by mutual Cohabitation, by Kissings, by Embracings, by giving
and receiving of Gifts and Tokens, etc. Praeal. c. in princ. and ibi gloss.
Dominic. and Franc. and alii.
, or by Words, expressing the continuance and perseverance of the mutual
Consent; as by calling each other Husband and Wife d. gloss.
: By the same means practiced, after the Parties be of ripe Age, fit for
Marriage, are those Spousals by them contracted in their Minority by words of
present time (being then Spousals de futuro by interpretation of Law only)
resolved or turned into Matrimony Abb. in c. fin. de Sponsal. extra. Lib. 1.

so dissolve the Contract before they consent Henr. Boic. in c. Attestationes de

praesumpt. 2. nu. 26.
: As for their dislent before they come to perfect Age, it hinders not the
exchange or passage of the Contract from Spousals (so termed by interpretation
of Law) to Matrimony, by any the means aforesaid c. de illis el. 1. de despons.
impub. in princ. and ibi gloss. verb. ullatenus, and Card. in princ. de c. and
in fin. etc. a nobis eod. tit. and ibi Panor. nu. 2.
. Howbeit this is to be diligently noted in this place, That Spousals de futuro
properly so called, those I mean which are contracted by words of future time,
(as I will take thee, etc.) do not pass from Spousals to Matrimony by any the
means aforesaid, or by any other Act, other than by the very Act of Carnal
Knowledge of the Parties so betroathed c. fin. de Sponsal. extra. and ibi

8. Fifthly, By the Laws of this Realm (as I take it) if a Woman, during her
Minority, be married to a Man seized of Lands or Tenements in Fee-simple, or
Fee tail, by Purchase or Descent, she shall be endowed of the third part of
such Lands and Tenements, so that she have accomplished the Age of nine years

SECT. VIII. Diverse Questions about Marriages or Spousals contracted by
Children.
1. THE Questions which I speak of, and which are now to be propounded, are of
diverse sorts Vide Summam Hostiens. Tit. de despons. impub.. fin. and Covar.
Tract. de Sponsal. prima part, c. 4. and 5.
by occasion of the diverse Circumstances (whereby the Case, and consequently
the Law is altered) incident to this Matter; for sometimes the Parties, which
are betroathed are both under Age., and sometimes the one of them in Minority,
and the other of ripe and perfect Age: Wherefore we will first handle such
Questions as belong to the first Case, then those which belong to the second
Case, and thirdly those Questions which belong to both Cases.

2. First, When the Parties betroathed are both of them Children at the time of
the Contract, then this Question may be demanded, Whether that Party which
first comes to lawful Age, may then dissent, or must stay and expect till the
other Party likewise come to lawful years de hac Q. DD. in c. de illis. el. 1.
de despons. impub. extra. Covar. de Spons. prima part, c. 5.. fin.
: Many are of this Opinion, That he or she who first comes to ripe Age, must
stay until the other Party attain to ripe Age also, and cannot in the mean time
dissent; or dissenting or disclaiming in Deed, yet this disclaimer is not to be
heard, nor this dissent regarded, the other Party yet standing in Minority
Gloss. in d.c. de illis and Summar. ibi them in medio, Schneidwin. tract. de
nuptiis. fol. 32. nu. 13. Consil. matrim. lib. 1. consil. ibidem 14. n. 3.
. Others are of a contrary Judgment, affirming, That it is not only lawful for
that Party, who first comes to lawful Age, to dissent Panor. Boic. and
Praepos. in d. c. de illis, el. 1. Hostiens. Summa Tit. de despons. impub..
fin. versic. si vero impubes quorum opinio communis est. Test Covar. Tract. de
Sponsal. prima part, c. 5.. 1. nu. 2.
, but also that it is necessary so to do Hostiens. Boic. and Praepos. ubi
supra, and haec opinio communis est ejusdem Covar. testimonio, loco quo supra.
, even so soon as he or she shall first reach unto this lawful Age, or
incontinently after Henric. Boic. in d. c. de illis el. 2. de despons. impub.
; otherwise he or she, by not dissenting, shall be deemed to have ratified the
former Contract, at the least for his or her own part, and to have referred the
matter to the power and election of the other Party to confirm or infirm the
same Summa Hostiens. Tit. de despens. impub.. in fin. versic. Sed si alter.
Henr. Boic. in d. c. de illis. versic. unde quando. Praepos. eodem c. nu. 1.

. And this Opinion, namely, That the Party who first comes to lawful Age may
then dissent, is embraced of the most part, as the truer Opinion Test Covar.
in Tract. suo de Sponsal. prima part, c. 5.. 1. nu. 2. Summa Silvestrin. Tit.
de Sponsal. q. 3. in fin.
. The Reason in my Conceit is very plain; for seeing it is granted by them
which hold the former Opinion, That even that Party which first comes to
lawful Age may then dissent, when the younger Party comes to the same Age
Gloss. in c. de illis el. 1. de despons. impub. extra. verb. minoris aetat. ibi

effect Panor. Boic. Hostiens. and Praepos. in d. c. de illis 1. Covar. Tract.

3. This Conclusion therefore, That the Party which first comes to lawful Age
may dissent during the others Minority is extended, and does proceed, albeit
the Contract were made by words of present time, or the Marriage solemnized in
the face of the Church Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. prima part, c. 5.. 1. in
prin. post. Praepos. and alios in c. de illis el. 1. de despons. impub. extra.
: But in these Cases following this Conclusion is limited, namely, when after
the Contract or Marriage the Parties know each other Carnally; for then though
both the Parties should dissent, the Contract or Marriage consummate cannot be
dissolved Henric. Boic. in c. Attestationes de despons. impub. extra. versic.
aut per tacitum, etc. Panor. in c. a nobis. eod. Tit. in sin Piaepos. in d. c.
Attestationes nu. 5 Schneidwin. tract. de nuptiis, fol. 32. n. 13. in fin.
; or if the Party, being near full Age, and of discretion to understand the
nature and peril of an Oath, did swear to perform the Contract c. ex literis
el. 2. de Sponsal. extra. and ibi Panor. and DD. quorum opinio communiter est
recepta referente Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. prima part, c. 5.. 1. n. 3. quem

; or if the Party which first came to ripe Age did not by and by, but a good
space after disclaim Henr. Boic. in c. de illis el. 1. de despons. impub.
extra. versic. aut quilibet. Praepos. in c. Attestationes eod. tit. nu. 4.
, in those Cases also the elder is to expect until the younger come to ripe
Age, nor is to be licensed to marry elsewhere in the mean time Hostiens. Summa.

4. The second Question concerning the first Case, (namely, when both the
Parties betroathed are under Age) shall be this, What if the Parties during
their Minority dissent, yet immediately after they be come to lawful years, do
both of them express their mutual Consent by Conjectures only (as by Kissings,
Embracings, Gifts, etc.) afterward the one of them alone dissenteth, and
marries a third Person, and does consummate the same by Carnal Knowledge;
Whether is this Marriage good in Law?

5. To this Question thus, If the former Contract were made by words of Future
time (as, I will take thee, etc.) then the Marriage is good c. 1. de matr.
contr. interdict. Ecclesiae, and ibi Panor.
albeit not consummate d.c. 1. de matr. contr. interdict. Ecclesiae, in quo
nulla fuit mentio copulae, sed nuptiarum tantum cum tertio, Add C. pen. de
Sponsal. extra. and DD. ibidem.
; the reason is this, more is not confirmed than was at the first contracted
Baleus in l. 3. C. si adversus rem judicat. in fin.
, that is Spousals de faturo properly so called, both because in form of words,
and in the intent of the Parties they were so. But Spousals de futuro, albeit
contracted by them of full Age, are taken away by Spousals de praesenti c.
sicut c. penult. de Sponsal. extra. and DD. ibidem.
. And therefore in our Case the Marriage is good, notwithstanding Paris.
consil. 51. vol. 4. Dec. consil. 468. Gem. and Franc. in c. unic.. 1. de
despons. impub. lib. 6.
the Spousals contracted in Minority, and confirmed afterward c. 1. de matr.
contr. interdict. Ecclesiae, and ibi DD. Corset. sing. verb. matrim. 178. Abb.
and Praepos. ibidem Paris. consil. 62. vol. 4.
. And this I take to be true, albeit the former Spousals had been confirmed by
giving and receiving a Ring Covar. tract. de Sponsal. prima part, c. 4.. 2.
nu. 2. DD. in c. fin. de despons. impub. extra.
.

6. But if the former Contract were made by words of present time (as, I do
take thee, etc.) then the Marriage, albeit consummate, is not good c. unic.. 1.
de despons. impub. lib. 6. and ibidem Gem. and Phil. Franc. and alii. Soarez.
Thesaur. com. Op. verb. Sponsalia nu. 163. Card. in c. de illis el. 1. de
despons. impub. extra and clarius pro Paris. consil. 51. vol. 4. quod videas.
. The Reason is, because this former Contract being in truth Matrimony, if we
regard either the form of words, or intent of the Parties Gem. Franc. Anchor.
and Jo. Andr. in c. unic.. 1. de despons. impub. in Sext. Paris. ubi supra. and
Phil. Dec. consil. 168.
and Spousals only by interpretation of Law DD. in d.. 1.
, because of the instant defect of perfect Consent, which perfect Consent in
due time once had, and the same mutually expressed, and so the former Contract
thereby confirmed and ratified, is of no less force or efficacy than is the
Contract of Spousals de praesenti, made betwixt Persons of perfect Age Paris.
and Dec. ubi supra. and DD. in d. c. unic.. 1. de despons. impub. in Sext.
, which cannot be dissolved by a second Marriage consummate with Carnal
Knowledge, and Procreation of Children c. si inter. and ibi Panor. Card. and
alii. de Sponsal. extra. quorum opinio est communis, Test Kirkhovio. Thesaur.
com. op. verb. Matrimonium.
. As for the first Circumstance of this Instance, namely, The dissent of the
Parties betrothed during their Minorities, it is not of any value Henr. Boic.
in. c. Attestationes. de despons. impub. extra. Summam Hostiens. Tit. de
despons. impub.. fin. versic. Sed pro Deo.
: The Reason is, because of the inconstancy and mutability of Children; for to
day they will, to morrow they will not; the third day they will, and they will
not, and so every day, In Dock out Nettle, until they come to years of
discretion Summa Hostiens. Tit. de despons. impub.. fin. versic. Sed pro Deo.
; and therefore worthily in the mean season are their unstable and doubtful
dissents not regarded. By the Solution of this second Question we may the
better aim at the Answer to a third Question proposed e're while about Infants,
viz.

7. If two Infants do contract Spousals by words of present time, confirming
the same by diverse Conjectures, not only after they have exceeded their
Infancy, but also after they have attained to full and perfect Age, Whether
this Contract ought to be judged as Spousals de futuro, or de praesenti
Hostiens. ubi infra Arg. l. cum non solum. filiis, and. ubi autem, C. de Boni.

prima part, c. 4.. 2. in fin. Menoch. de praesump. Lib. 3. praesump. prima.
nu. 66.
, grounding their Assertion upon this Reason especially, Because the Text of
the Law, whereby it is provided, That Spousals may become Matrimony by other
Signs and Conjectures than by Carnal Knowledge, does speak in these terms only,
where the Spousals are contracted by those Children which have passed their
Infancy Text. in d. c. unic. de despons. impub. in Sext.. 1. and ibi Jo. Andr.
, and which are not void at the beginning, as are the Spousals contracted by
Infants l. in Sponsal. ff. de Sponsal. d. c. unic. in princ. and DD. ibidem.
; and therefore, that it were absurd Henr. Boic. in c. attestat. de despons.
impub. extra. col. penul. versic. Aut per aliud.
to extend the matter from Spousals, which are something, to Spousals which are
not any thing. Howbeit the common Opinion (besides that it is of more
authority, and tending to the favor of Matrimony) ought therefore to be
preferred Vide Coras. Tract. de communi opinione lib. 3. cas. 20.
, it is neither absurd nor destitute of reason; for seeing the Act
confirmatory, is not otherwise to be understood, than according to the nature
of the words of the Act confirmed Bald. in l. 3. C. si adversus rem judic. in
fin. Dominic. post Anto. in c. unic.. 1. despons. impub. and Phil. Franc.
ibidem.
, the words being de praesenti, the Contract confirmed is to be adjudged
accordingly, that is, as Spousals de praesenti Gem. and Phil. Franc. ubi supra.
.

8. When the Case is such, That one of the Parties betrothed is of full Age,
the other in Minority, then this Question may be demanded, Whether that Party
which is of full Age ought to expect until the other come to full Age likewise?
or if the elder will not stay, but marry a third Person during the minority of
the younger, Whether is this Marriage good, yea or no?

9. There is no question, but that the Party which is of full Age ought to
stay, being so commanded by the very Text of the Law, and prohibited to marry
elsewhere c. de illis el. 1.. mulier autem. de despons. impub. Summa Hostiens.
Tit de despons. impub.. fin. in princ. Schneidwin. Tract. de nuptiis, fol. 32.
nu. 14.
. But, if contrary to this Prohibition, the same Party do adventure in deed to
marry a third Person, during the minority of the other Party, by the Opinion of
the most and best Learned in the Laws Ecclesiastical, this Marriage now done is
good Hostiens. Summa. Tit. de despons. impub.. fin. col. pen. versic. quid. si
pubes. decis. Rot. 450. in Nov. Schnedwin. Tract. de nuptiis, fol. 32. nu. 14.
Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. prima part, c. 5.. 2. nu. 7. Praepos. in c. de illis
el. 1. nu. 4. de despons. impub.
, for multa prohibentur fieri quae tamen facta convalescunt c. nec illud. 30.
q. 5. decis. Rot. 450.
, many things are forbidden to be done, which notwithstanding being done, are
available in Law.

10. And this Conclusion proceeds not only when the former Contract is made
by words of fu^u^e time (as, I will take thee, etc.) but also when it is made
by words of present time (as, I do take thee, etc.) decis. Rot. 450. and
Praepos. in c. de illis el. 1. nu. 4. de despons. impub. referens hanc
opinionem esse communem.
the Reason is, because this Contract which is made by words of present time
betwixt two Parties, whereof the one is of full and perfect Age, the other but
a Child, is understood to be mere Spousals in respect of both Parties, and not
Matrimony in respect of the elder, and Spousals in respect of the younger c.
fin. de desponsal. impub. extra. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. c. 5.. 2. nu. 5.
versic. hinc constat. decis. Rot. 450. Praepos. in d. c. de illis el. 1. ubi
dicit hanc esse conclusicnem auream.
. The reason of this reason is, because such is the nature of Matrimonial
Contracts, as it always requires a mutual and equal harmony or agreement
betwixt either party; neither can abide to halt or suffer that the one Party be
tied, and the other at liberty Hostiens. Summa de despons. impub.. fin. versic.
quid si pubes.
; like as it is in Correlatives, whereof the one cannot consist without the
other. And therefore it is no more possible that this Contract should be
Matrimony in the one Party, and Spousals in the other Party, than it is
possible for a man to be a Husband without a Wife, or for a Woman to be a Wife
without a Husband Hostiens. ubi supra.
: Indeed the elder party, which marries against the Prohibition of the Law, is
punishable c. 1. de matr. contr. interd. Eccles. Henr. Boic. in c. praeterea de
Sponsal. extra ubi distinguit.
, but the Marriage past, is not now revocable by the former Contract, having no
greater force than Spousals de futuro Praepos. in c. de illis el. 1. de
despons. impub. nu. 4. decis. Rot. 450. DD. in c. unic.. 1. de despons. impub.
in Sext.
.

11. The second Question belonging to this second Case shall be this, Two
Persons contract Spousals by words of present time, the one of them only then
being of sufficient Age, the younger afterward coming to years of consent does
ratify and confirm the Contract, but the elder then dissenteth and marries a
third Person, Whether is this Marriage good, yea or nay?

12. Some incline to this Opinion, That the Marriage is not good Summa
Silvestr. verb. Matrimon. 5. q. 8. Gosadin. cons. 2. nu. 11.27, 28.
, supposing that it is not in the power of the Party, which was of full Age at
the time of the Contract, to disavow the same Contract at any time after; but
that it is in the Election of the younger Party only to consent or dissent, as
soon as he or she shall attain to lawful Age Silvester. and Gosadin. ubi supra.
: Like as in other Covenants and Bargains, where if one of lawful Age make a
Contract or Bargain with another during his Nonage, this Contract is good
against the Person of full Age Instit. Tit. de authoritate Tut. in princ.
, to whose folly it is imputed, that he would enter into Covenants, or become
bound to one under Age L. qui cum alio. de Reg. Jur. ff. and ibi DD.
, but not against the Minor, who may better his Estate, but not make it worse
by any Bonds or Covenants Instit. de authoritate Tut. in princ. C. de
contrahend. and committend. stipulat. L. neque, and L. 1. C. author. praestand.
. Others notwithstanding are of a contrary Judgment Covar. Tract. de Sponsal.
prima part, in fin. per c. 1.. 1. de despons. impub. in Sext. decis. Rotae
150. Schneidwin. Tract. de Nuptiis, fol. 32.
, esteeming that the former Contract of Spousals can never be resolved, or
changed into Matrimony, otherwise than by a new and mutual Consent of either
Party, expressed by Word, or insinuated by Deed, after they are both of lawful
Age c. 1.. 1. de despons. impub. in Sext. and ibi Gem. Franc. and alii.
: And that in the mean time, and until this new Consent of both the Parties be
expressed, the former Contract is not of any greater force or efficacy than
Spousals de futuro c. fin. de Sponsal. extra. Praepos. in c. de illis el. 1. de
despons. impub. extra. and ibi Henr. Boic. and alii.
, and therefore unable to impugn a second Contract of Marriage c. penul. de
Sponsal. extra. Decis. Rot. 450. Covar. Tract. de Spons. prima part, in fin.
quem velim. videas.
: And this Opinion, in my conceit, is the truer, and more agreeable to the Text
c. unic.. 1. de despons. impub. in Sext. and Covar. ubi supra. Co. Inst. fol.
79. b.
.

13. The other Questions common to both Cases (that is, in case both the
Parties be under Age, or in case the one of them only) are these, viz.

Whether the Parties contracting Matrimony in Minority are presumed to consent
and to ratify the same, if so be, when they, or either of them, attain to
years of consent, they do not expressly dissent from or disclaim the former
Contract?

Item, By what Signs or Conjectures this Consent is proved?

Item, Before whom, and at what time the Parties are to disclaim, in case they,
or either of them, do dislike of the former Contract?

14. For the first Question, it may seem, That unless the Parties do expressly
dissent, they are presumed to consent, and thereby to confirm the Marriage
contracted during Minority; for it is a Rule of the Law, Qui voluntatem mutatam
dicit, hoc probare debet Lenim qui. ff. de probac. Mascard. Tract. de probac.
concl. 14, 16.
, whosoever affirms one's mind to be changed, must prove the same: Howbeit the
contrary is rather to be established in this place, namely, That this Consent
is not hereby presumed, by reason of another more special Text, speaking in the
terms of our Question, which says, Nisi per Carnis Copulam vel aliquem modum
aliunn eosdem contrahentes, cum ejusdem perseverantia voluntate, ad pubertatis
tempora pervenisse, constiterit and evidenter, Matrimonium (quod, ut
Matrimonium, non tenuit aetate prohibente) per lapsum dicti temporis non
convalescit c. unic.. 1. de despons. impub. lib. 6.
; unless it shall appear evidently by Carnal Knowledge, or some other means,
that the same Persons contracting do come to ripe Age with continuance of the
same Will, the Matrimony (which held not as Matrimony, young Age prohibiting)
is not made forcible by Lapse of the time: Wherefore seeing the Law does
specially require an evident proof of continuance of good Will, or Consent, by
Carnal Knowledge, or other means, the general presumption of perseverance,
grounded in the former Rule, is not sufficient in this Case Nam ubi lex
requirit aliquid probari quod alias praesumitur, non acquiescit illi simplici
juris praesumptioni. Arg. L. pen. ff. de Var. and extraord. cogni. Menoch. de
praesump. Lib. 5. c. 1. nu. 36. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. prima part, c. 4..

.

15. Others concerning this Question make a difference, Whether the Parties do
cohabit or dwell together, yea or no Summa Hostiens. Tit. de despons. impub..
ult. versic. Quid si pubes. gloss. in c. literas. de despons. impub. extra.
gloss. in c. ubi. 30. q. 2.
? If they dwell together in one House, then it is needful that they express
their dissents, otherwise by this their Cohabitation they are presumed to yield
their mutual Consents, and to ratify and confirm c. ad id quod de Sponsal. c.
Insuper. Qui matr. accus. poss. c. significavit. de eo qui duxit in ux. quam.
pell. and ibi DD. lib. 1. consil. matrim. cons. ibidem. 53. nu. 7. L. minorem.
ff. de. ritu nup.
, which Conclusion is enlarged diversely.

16. First, Whether the House be his or hers, or any others Phil. Franc. in c.
unic.. 1. de despons. impub. lib. 6.
, by this the mutual Cohabitation in any of them, this Consent is presumed Gem.
and Franc. in d.. 1.
.

17. Secondly, Albeit either of the Parties, during their Minority, were
constrained by fear to marry, (by reason whereof the same was utterly void) c.
cum locum. de Sponsal. extra. and infra.
, yet by Cohabitation after years of Consent, this fear is purged, and the
Marriage confirmed c. Insuper. Qui matr. accus. poss. c. ad id quod. de
Sponsal. extra Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 3.. 6.
.

18. Thirdly, Albeit the Parties did not cohabit together by the space of a
year or more, but for some few Months or Days Immo vel unius Diei spontanea
Cohabitatio purgat metum inquit, Praepos. in c. ad id quod. de Sponsal. extra.
nu. 3. Crederem tamen, ipso Judicis arbitrio relinqui, quantum temporis
sufficiat ad purgandum metum. Henr. Boic. in c. cum locum. de Sponsal. extra.
and Panor. in d. c. ad id quod. nu. 4.
, after their coming to lawful Age, yet by this short Cohabitation as Man and
Wife, they are presumed to yield their Consent, and to confirm the former
Contract Hostiens. Panor. and Praepos. in d.c. ad id quod de Sponsal. extra.
and Cardinal. ibidem, ubi distinguit inter matrimonium metu contractum and
matrimonium inter impuberes celebratum.
: And albeit in the Text there be mention of Cohabitation by the space of a
year and a half Text. in d. c. ad id quod.
, yet this certain time is set down, not because there is any Mystery of Law
thereby signified, but because it did so fall out in the Fact there described
Panor. and Praepos. eod. c. ad id quod.
.

19. Howbeit it is not perpetual, that the Parties betrothed or married,
dwelling together after their Minority expired, are thereby presumed to yield
their mutual Consents: For if this Cohabitation be coacted, not voluntary, it
works no such presumption c. insuper. Qui matr. accuss. poss. extra.
; or if this Cohabitation continue diverse years, yet if the disliking Party
have not the opportunity of safe Escape, belike it does not make any such
presumption of Consent against the Party thus straightly kept Gloss. in d. c.
Insuper. Everard. consil. 19. quod etiam extat in lib. 2. consil. matr. consil.
ibidem. 4. nu. 34. Mascard. Tract. de probac. concl. 1054. nu. 30, 34.
, expressing his or her dissent from time to time d. c. Insuper and ibidem
gloss.
, and proving the impediment, albeit also the Party were carnally known Gloss.
and DD. in d. c. Insuper.
.

20. If the Parties betrothed or married, do not cohabit or dwell together,
then I suppose that this Consent is not presumed by lapse of time only, albeit
the Parties do not expressly dissent Hostiens. Summa Tit. de defpons. impub..
fin. versic. quid si pubes. c. unic.. 1. de despons. impub. lib. 6. Covar.
Tract. de Spons. prima part, c. 4.. 2. n. 3. versic. secundum Matrimonium.
, and therefore that it must be proved by the Party which affirms it, not by
the Party which denies it l. 2. ff. de probac.
; I mean of such a Consent, whereby the former Contract, having the form of
Spousals de praesenti, contracted by Children (and therefore by interpretation
of Law Spousals de futuro) are resolved into Matrimony d. c. unic.. 1. de
despons. impub. in Sext.
. As for that Consent whereby the former Contract shall still prevail as mere
Spousals, that was presumed from the beginning, and is still presumed to
continue, albeit the Parties dwell not together, but far asunder c. ex literis.
el. 2. de Sponsal. extra Boic. in c. de illis. el. 1. de despons. impub. col.
2. Boic. in d. c.
, unless they, as soon as they attain to lawful years, do express their
dissent, and do disclaim from the former Contract Boic. in d. c. de illis. and
in c. Attestationes. de despons. impub.
.

21. Concerning the second Question, namely, by what Signs or Conjectures this
aforesaid Consent is proved, whereby the Marriage contracted during the
Minority of both the Parties, or of the one of them, is confirmed.

I said a little before supra. 7. paulo ante finem.
, That by what means Spousals contracted during infancy, are afterward
confirmed, when the Parties cease to be Infants; by the same means is the
Marriage confirmed which was contracted during Minority, after the Parties come
to years of discretion gloss. in c. unic.. 1. de despons. impub. lib. 6. and
ibi Gem. and Franc. Abbas in c. fin. de Sponsal. extra. quam opinionem
communiter receptam aiunt, Paris. cons. 51. and cons. 52. vol. 4. Baptista a
Vallalob and Soarez. Thesaur. com. opinio. verb. Sponsalia. ille; nu. 91. hic;
nu. 163. lib. 1. consil. matr. consil. ibidem 17. nu. 6, 7. Dec. consil. 368.
. Which Conclusion, many (I confess) do deny to be simply true; namely,
concerning those not so strong Conjectures, viz. of Kissings, Embracings,
giving and receiving of Tokens, the saluting or naming of each other by the
Names or Titles of Husband and Wife, etc. Covar. tract. de Sponsal. prima
part, c. 4.. 4. nu. 4. Carol. Molin. in addic. ad Dec. consil. 368.
whereby Spousals contracted by Infants are afterward confirmed gloss. and DD.
in c. unic. de Sponsal. lib. 6. in princ.
. In which Controversy, whether Opinion ought rather to be received, we may
the better discern, if we shall first view the Reafons and Authorities of
either Party.

22. This in the mean time is without Controversy, That if the Parties, after
they be come to lawful years, being then free from former Contracts, do by
plain and direct words, without fear or fraud, express their mutual Consents;
as if they say [ We do ratify and confirm the Marriage contracted betwixt us,
etc.] the Marriage (which before was no more but Spousals de futuro, in
construction of Law) is now made true and undoubted Matrimony Henric. Boic. in
c. Attestationes. de desponsal. impub. extra. col. 2. versic. Ant. per
expressum. Summam Silvestr. verb. Matrimonium 5. q. 8.
. This also is without Controversy, That if the Parties willingly, or of their
own accord know each other carnally, the Marriage before contracted in their
Minority, is from henceforth of no less force in Law, than if the same were now
again contracted by words of the present time, during their lawful Ages c.
insuper. qui matr. accus. poss. and ibi Panor. and Praepos. Henr. Boic. in d.
c. Attestationes.
. By voluntary Cohabitation likewise, c. ad id quod. de Sponsal. extra. and ibi
gloss. and DD.
(as I have before declared) and by Subarration, or giving and receiving of
Rings gloss. Panor. and Praepos. in c. fin. de despons. impub. and in c. Tenor.
de Reg. Jud. extra.
, (as hereafter shall be showed) infra. 15.
, is this former Contract, having but the form of Marriage, endued with the
virtue and very nature of true substantial Matrimony Covar. tract. de Sponsal.
prima part, c. 4.. 2. nu. 4. verse. Ego. Praepos. in c. fin. de dedespons.
impub. extra. nu. 4. in fin. Paris. consil. 51. nu. 1. vol. 4.
: And generally by whatsoever means Spousals de futuro, contracted by them of
perfect Age, are resolved into Matrimony Covar. ubi supra Henr. Poic. in c.
Attestat. de desponsal. impub. extra. col. pen.
: The Reason is, because if there be any means of such power and virtue, as
thereby those Spousals de futuro (which have neither form of Matrimony, nor
intention of the Parties when they were first made) are distilled into
Matrimony, much more easily by the strength and operation of the same means,
are those Spousals converted into Matrimony, which both by form and intention
of the Parties were Matrimony from the beginning Henr. Boic. in d. c.
Attestationes.
.

23. Wherefore concerning these proofs, wherein there is not any Controversy,
I will not enter into any further discourse, but return to those other more
feeble Conjectures of Kissings, Embracings, giving and receiving of Tokens,
etc. which diverse do reject, as altogether insufficient in this behalf,
admitting no other Conjectures herein, but such as are evident and urgent, and
equivalent to the presumption of Carnal Copulation Covar. tract. de Sponsal.
prima part, c. 4.. 2. nu. 4. Molin. in apostill. ad Dec. consil. 468.
. Their Reasons are,

First, Because the very Text (as we heard) requires that this Consent,
whereby Spousals are turned into Matrimony, do appear evidenter, evidently
Text. in c. unic.. 1. de desponsal. impub. extra.
.

Secondly, Forasmuch as to contract Matrimony is a matter of far greater
prejudice than to contract or confirm Spousals, therefore the presumptions
ought to be so much the stronger to prove this Matrimonial Consent, by how much
the prejudice is greater that does depend and may ensue of Matrimony, than of
Spousals Covar. and Molin. ubi. supra.
.

Thirdly, Because these Amorous Actions of Kissings and Embracings, Gifts, etc.
are often practiced as Preambles and Allurements rather to accomplish the
accomplishment of unlawful Lusts, and to quench the Flames of Youthful Desires,
than to tie the indissoluble Knot of chaste Wedlock, or to undergo the perpetual
Burden of so weighty a Charge vide Mascard. de probac.
.

24. Howbeit those, or whatsoever other Reasons not unprobable, nor lightly to
be esteemed, to the contrary notwithstanding, the affirmative Sentence, viz.
That these former Conjectures are sufficient, is most commonly received, both

other means, as well as Carnal Knowledge, for proof of this Consent, or
perseverance of former good Will Text. inc. unic.. 1. de despons. impub. l. 6.
, it was thought most reasonable, of the most part, to admit those Signs, or
those Conjectures, for testimony thereof, which are most commonly used in this
Case by those Persons which faithfully intend to become Husband and Wife DD. in
d.c. unic.. 1. de despons. impub. in Sext. Mascard. Tract. de probac. concl.
1032.
; amongst which Signs and Conjectures, are there any more frequent than
Kissings, Embracings, Gifts, etc? If none more usual, Then what reason to
reject them as insufficient?

Because the Law requires an evident proof, be it so; but lawful Conjectures
are an evident proof, and so allowed by the Law Barto. and alii, in L. licet
Imperator ff. de Leg. 1. Menoch. de praesump. lib. 1. q. 45. ubi vult hoc non

confirmation of Matrimony? Because it is a matter of greater prejudice, you will
say, than Spousals Hac ratione nituntur, Covar. and Molin. ubi supra.
. Indeed thereupon it may be justly inferred, That those Conjectures which
prove not the confirmation of Spousals, cannot prove the confirmation of
Matrimony. But this Argument holds not; Spousals are thereby confirmed, Ergo
not Matrimony. If you crave an Instance, Spousals are confirmed by Cohabitation
c. unic. de despons. impub. lib. 6. in princ.
, and yet by Cohabitation is Marriage confirmed also Gloss. and DD. in c. ad id

25. The last Question is, Before whom, and when, the Parties betrothed or
married in Minority are to disclaim, or to express their dissent in case they,
or either of them, dislike the Match?

In Answering whereof, I need not to be tedious, because the matter is not
contentious: This therefore in short. The dissent is to be made and published
before the Bishop of the Diocese where the disliking Party dwells c. de

. Now if any desire to know when the Parties are said to be of ripe Age, or of
years of Consent, let him read the next Paragraph.

SECT. IX. Of Ripe or Lawful Age for Marriage.
1. THE third Age now to be considered is ripe Age, that is to say, that Age
wherein it is lawful not only to contract Spousals, but also to Solemnize true,
perfect, and indissoluble Matrimony, and thereby effectually to become Husband
and Wife, both before God and his Church; which Age, when it does begin, is now
to be discussed. In the Explication whereof, it is not my meaning to enter into
any Philosophical Discourse, by discovering what number of years the Ancient
Philosophers, as Plato and Aristotle (whose chief regard was Natural Causes and
Effects) did prescribe in this behalf; the one exacting of the Man Five and
thirty years, and of the Woman Sixteen years Plato lib. 6. de repub. lib. 4. de
legib. Tiraquel. de legibus Connub. leg. 5. versic. Plato.
; the other Seven and thirty years of the Man, and Eighteen of the Woman
Aristoteles lib. 7. politic. c. 16. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c.
5. in princ. Tiraquil. de legibus. Connub. Lege. 5. verse. Aristoteles.
. Neither is it my purpose in Historical manner to dilate what number of years
has been prefixed for Marriage in former Ages, and Foreign Countries: As how
Lycurgus (famous for his prudent Laws among the Lacedaemonians) perceiving great
Mischiefs did attend upon untimely Marriages (as the bad Agreement betwixt the
married Couple, the great danger of the young Mother in Childbed, and the weak
and wretched Issue, whereby the Commonwealth was rather weakened than
strengthened) denied his Country Folks Marriage, until they had attained to
full ripeness of Years, ability of Body, discretion and constancy of Mind,
likely to avoid all those dangers Anto. Gubertus Tract. de Nuptiis, fol. 76. in
fin. and 77. in princ. Tiraquel. de legibus. Connub. Lege. 5. verse. Lycurgus.
. Or how ( M. Pappius Mutilus, and Q. Poppaeus Secundus, being Consuls of Rome)
Marriage was forbidden to Men above Sixty, and to Women above fifty years old
c. quaedam. distinc. 2. Minsing. lib. 3. Inst. tit. de Success. Libert.. postea
post Alciat. lib. 3. dispunct. c. 3. and 6.
, because they were not able to benefit the Commonwealth by Procreation Anto.

Nuptiis, Tiraquel. de legibus Connub. Leg. 5. verse. Sed and si.
. Or how that Law, being called Lex Pappia and Poppaea Poppea non autem

, after those two Consuls, was afterward abolished by the Emperor Claudius,
and liberty granted to old Men, albeit above Eighty years, to marry Women under
Fifty Anto. Gubert. Tract. de Nuptiis, fol. 78. nu. 58.
; for that it was then thought not altogether impossible for a Man of that Age
to beget Children Tranquillus in Claud. c. 23. Anto. Gubert. ubi supra. nu. 57.
; like as it is recorded of Masinissa King of Numidia, who being Eighty six
years old, begot a Son called Mathumatus Plin lib. 7. Not. Hist. c. 14. Gubert.
Tract. de Nuptiis, fol. 79. nu. 63. Minsing. in. postea Instit. de Success.

; and likewise of Cato Censorius, who begot diverse Children of the Daughter of
his Client Salo, after Eighty eight Gubertus and Minsingerus ubi supra ex
Plinio, Plutarcho, Solino, and aliis.
: Or how others esteem of these Accidents as of Miracles Tiraquel. de legib.

, and like unto that concerning Sarah Genesis c. 21. verse. 2. Epistol. ad Hebr.
c. xi. v. xi.
: Or how some disputing of the Marriages betwixt Youth and Age, do utterly
condemn the same, if not as unlawful, yet as a most unseemly, unequal,
unpleasant, inconvenient, and perilous Match; the one Party desiring that thing
most of all, which the other Party (of all things) is least able to perform
Tiraquell. de legibus Connub. lege 5. verse. Sed and secuti: quem velim perlegas.
, the occasion of continual Jars, of filthy Adulteries, and sometimes also of
cruel and wilful Murders Tiraquel. ubi supra.
. Into these discourses or disputes I will not wade; my meaning in this place
is to unfold, at what Age by the Laws Ecclesiastical of this Realm, now in
force, it is lawful to contract, not Spousals only, but true and perfect
Matrimony.

2. Understand therefore, That a Man so soon as he has accomplished the Age of
Fourteen years, and a Woman so soon as she has accomplished the Age of Twelve
years, may Contract true and lawful and individual Matrimony c. Puberes c.
Attestationes, c. continebatur de despons. impub. L. quaesitum L. in Sponsal.
and ibi gloss. A. de Sponsal. L. mulierem de ritu nupt. ff. Summa Hostiens.

2. Panor. in c. Attestationes, de despons. impub. nu. 7. Lindwood in c. unic.
de despons. impub. lib. 4. provincial. constit. Cant. verb. aetatem.
, in case there be no other impediment to hinder the same: The Reason is, that
because at these years the Man and the Woman are not only presumed to be of
discretion d.c. unic. de despons. impub. lib. 4. provincial. constit. Cant.
verb. tempus discretionis.
, and able to discern betwixt good and evil, and what is for their profit and
disprofit Anto. Gubert. Tract. de Nuptiis, fol. 67. nu. 20. ubi assignat
rationem cur adveniente pubertate sapiant.
; but also to have Natural and Corporal Ability to perform the duty of Marriage
Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 5. nu. 2. Praepos. in c. Tuae. de^
despons. impub. extra. nu. 2.
, and in that respect are termed Puberes c. Puberes de despons. impub. extra,
and ibi DD. Spiegel. Lexic. verb pubertas.
, as it were Plants, now sending forth Buds and Flowers, apparent Testimonies
of inward Sap, and immediate Messengers of approaching Fruit Spiegel. ubi.
supra. Anto. Gubert. Tract. de Nuptiis, fol. 69. nu. 23.
. And albeit this Age may seem over-tender and over-timely to prevent those
Inconveniences so long ago foreseen by Lycurgus, Plato, and the rest de quibus
Tiraquel. de legibus Connub. lege 5. versic. Lycurgus.
, yet considering the Lord and Maker of all Creatures, in the beginning of the
World, has by Divine Providence, for the propagation of his Church, proclaimed
an universal Liberty Crescite and Multiplicamini Genes. c. 1. versic. 28.
. And therefore that this Liberty is to be denied to none, whom otherwise the
Almighty has naturally disposed and enabled to increase and multiply Hostiens.
Summa. Tit. de Matr.. ubi. and. quis. cum Addic. ibidem. Anto. Gubert. Tract.
de Nuptiis, fol. 49.
; considering also, that like as the little Sparks are to be extinguished at
the very first, least afterward they mount to an unquenchable Flame: So
whosoever have any such Sparks of Natural Provocation, whereby their hearts may
be kindled, or set on fire by ungodly Lusts. To these Persons, albeit very
young, the Remedy against Lust is not to be denied Epist. 1. ad Corinth. c. 7.
v. 2. c. quicquid c. sicut 32. q. 2. Addic. ad Hostiens. ubi supra. Melchior
Kling. Tract. de Causis Matrimonial. fol. 84.
, especially seeing it is better to marry than to burn Epist. ad Cor. c. 2. v.
9. Silva Nuptialis lib. 3. n. 21.
. These things (I say) considered, it is a large and clear case, That we may
not so foresee the avoidance of Temporal Discommodities, with Lycurgus, or any
other Philosophers, that we oversee greater Dangers by abridging the general
Liberty of Generation, established without distinction of years by our eternal
Lycurgus, and heavenly Lawmakers; or by denying or deferring to any that are
stinged with Carnal Appetite, the blessed and Sovereign Remedy against this
Poison, invented by Divine Philosophy.

3. But what may be the Reason wherefore Women are sooner ripe than Men?

I will not Answer with the Gloss, Quia cito crescit herba mala gloss. in l.
11. C. de his qui veniam aetate impetr.
, for this is but a Jest. Macrobius, (he says) it is propter votorum
festinationem i. e. propter desiderium generandi, and pervenientem vim
naturalem. Anto. Gubert. Tract. de Nuptiis, fol. 70. nu. 30. Seu propter
malitiam supplentem aetatem. Ita Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 5.
nu. 2. Tiraquellus de legibus Connub. leg. 5. verse. sed jam nunc.
, for the forwardness of their Desire: Some do yield this Reason, Quia facilius
est pati quam agere Praepos. in c. puberes de despons. impub. per c. Juvenis.
de Sponsal. extra. Lindwood in c. unic. de desponsal. impub. lib. 4.
provincial. constit. Cant.
; this is something but it is not all: Others, because the Female Bodies are
more tender and moister than the Male Theophrast. lib. 1. plant. Anto. Gubert.
Tract. de Nuptiis, fol. 69. n. 25.
: And so Men's Bodies being harder and drier, they are more slow in ripening;
and Women's Bodies, because they are softer and moister, are more quickly ripe;
like as it is to be seen in Plants and fruits, whereof that which is more soft
and moist is sooner ripe, than that which is hard and dry Anto. Gubert. ubi
supra. post. Theophrast. Aristot. and alios.
. And this I take to be the best Reason, and is agreeable to that which
follows, namely, That even that Fruit which is sooner ripe, does sooner
decay: So Women as they are sooner able, so they sooner become unable to bring
forth than Men to beget Panor. in c. 1. de despons. impub. extra. Tiraquel. de
legib. Connub. lege 5. verse. nec erit imtempestivum.
.

4. The former Rule standing upon these Reasons and Foundations agreeable to
the Law of God and Nature, is thus extended: First, Albeit he or she have not
fully accomplished their several Ages of Fourteen and Twelve years at the time
of the Marriage, the same peradventure being Solemnized within one, two, or
three days next before the expiration of those several years, yet is the
Marriage of no less force than if the last hours of those years had also been
expired Panor. in c. Attestationes. de despons. impub. extra. nu. 7. in fin.

.

5. The second Ampliation is, That albeit he that has accomplished the Age of
Fourteen years at the time of the Marriage, be not then able to pay the Debt
which he owes to his Wife, yet by the received Opinion (though some dissent)
the Matrimony is not therefore by and by to be adjudged void, but she is to
expect until he have overreached the Eighteenth year of his Age Panor.

the Marriage may be dissolved Panor. in d. c. puberes. de despons. impub.

6. The third Ampliation is, That after the expiration of Fourteen and Twelve
years, Men and Women, how old soever they be, may lawfully marry,
notwithstanding any Prohibition of former Laws L. Sancinus. el. 2. C. de
Nuptiis, c. nuptiarum 27. q. 1. in princ. gloss. and DD. in c. quod Sedem de
frigid. and malef. extra.

Men also (if we may believe the Learned) are at length ( viz. after Eighty
years) deprived and spoiled of the Ability of getting Children Albertus (tam re

Menoch. ubi supra.

Sancinus C de nup.

Aged a Solace of Humanity. But I speak this rather to defend the Marriage of
the Aged from unlawfulness, than to commend it for comeliness consule Tiraquel.

.

7. The fourth Ampliation is, That albeit the Man and the Woman have not as yet
accomplished his and her full Age of Fourteen years and Twelve, but proximi
pubertati, next unto ripe Age, or nearer ripe Age than Infancy; viz. he of the
Age of Ten years and an half, and she of the Age of Nine years and an half, or
upwards, toward his or her several Ages of Fourteen and Twelve Covar. Tract.

, if during this time malitia supplet aetatem, natural Ability to perform the
Duty of Marriage (for so the word malitia signifies in this place, as I have
shown in another place supra. 7.

several Ages of Fourteen and twelve years c. puberes, etc. c. de illis. el. 2.

; or if those Persons be yet younger, viz. proximi infantiae, next unto
Infancy, or nearer their Infancy than their ripe Age, yet having discretion of

Debt thereunto belonging, the Marriage is lawful and effectual Panor. in c. de

and have the use of her Body before she be Seven years old, that the Marriage
is good Hostiens. in c. puberes de despons impub. per. c. Juvenis. de Sponsal

; for, say that the Infant was known Carnally (which things is no less

discretion to understand what is the Nature of Matrimony Covar. ubi supra.

Ages of Fourteen or Twelve years, two things are requisite to the validity and
force of Marriage; the one is, Discretion to discern the the Nature and Force
of Marriage; the other is, Natural Ability to pay the Marriage Debt Covar. in

? or rather peradventure thou demandest, Whether it be possible for a Child to
beget or bear a Child?

Indeed this Question Whether, must first be satisfied before that other
Question How; for thy satisfaction therefore, whether it be possible, I will
deliver what I have received of others. An ancient Father of the Church, of no
less Learning than Credit, Jerome by name, writes thus Hierom. Epist. ad

than modesty will suffer) the Woman gorged her self with sweet Wine, and being
inflamed with Lust, provoked the Child by her unchaste Motions to commit the
Act, the first Drunkenness being iterated the second Night, caused a Custom of
the other Nights following. But e're two Months were past, behold her Belly
began to swell. What will ye have more? by the Providence of God it came to
pass, that she that did abuse the simplicity of the Infant, to the Contempt of
God, was discovered by the Lord of Nature. Gregory likewise in a certain

SECT. X. By what Form of Words Spousals de futuro are contracted.
1. THat we may understand by what form of words Spousals de futuro are
contracted, it is needful diligently to observe two Distinctions: The first
Distinction is, That of words whereby Spousals are contracted: Some are of the
present time, as [I do take thee to my Wife] and [I do take thee to my Husband,
etc. c. Si inter de Sponsal. extra. and ibi DD. Lancel. Instit. Jur. Can. Tit
de Sponsal.. 1. Summa Silvestrin. verb. Matrimon. el. 2. q. 9. Henr. Boic. in
c. ex part. de Sponsal. extra.
] and some of the future time, as [I will take thee to my Wife] and [I will
take thee to my Husband; etc. d. c. si inter. and DD. in c. ex part. de
Sponsal. extra Lancel. and Henr. Boic. ubi. supra. Melchior Kling. Tract. de
cause. Matrimonial. fol. 1.
].

2. The second Distinction is; That of words, some do sound or harp of the
entrance or beginning of Marriages; as to Contract, to Espouse, to Marry, to
Take, to Make Wife or Husband, etc. Panor. in c. ex literis. el. 1. de Sponsal.

. And some again do sound of the end and execution of Marriage, as to Have, to
Hold, to Entreat, to Provide for, as Wife and Husband, etc. Panor. Praepos.

. The use of which Distinction is this.

3. When the Parties contracting Spousals do use words of future time, these
are Spousals de futuro, and not Spousals de praesenti c. penul.. vertum de
Sponsal extra.
; in case also, these words do sound of the entrance and beginning of Marriage
Panor. and Praepos in c. ex literis. el. 1. de Spons^l. extra. alter nu. 5.
alte:. nu. 6. Summa Silvestr. verb. Matrimo. 2. q. 9. Menoch. de praesump. lib

, otherwise the Spousals are de praesenti, like as if they were contracted by
words of the present time Panor. and Praepos. ubi supra. and Sum. Silvestr. ubi
supra. lib. 1. consil matr. consil. ibidem lx. nu. 16.
. For Example; Imagine that the Man says thus to the Woman [I will marry thee

.] And that the Woman answering, says; And [I will marry thee] or [I will
Espouse thee] or [I will contract Marriage with thee] or [I will take thee to
my Husband, etc.] By these, and such like words, Spousals de futuro are
contracted Summa Silvestr. verb. Matrimo. el. 2. q. 9. DD. in c. ex literis. de
Sponsal. extra. Henr. Boic. in c. ex part. eod. Tit. Covar. ubi supra.
.

4. The reason wherefore these words import no more but Spousals de futuro, I
have before delivered, namely, because like as when a Man does promise that he
will sell and will pay, etc. this is no perfect Sale, nor present payment, but
a promise of a future Sale or Payment Gloss. in l. In venden. C. de contrahend.
Emption. Jason and alii in l. servi Election. ff. de leg. 1. lib. 2. consil.
matr. consil. ibid. 2. nu. 6.
: Even so whiles the Parties only promise that they will Marry, will Espouse,
will Contract Matrimony, will take or make each other Man and Wife, etc. this
is no present Marriage, no present Espousals, no present Contract of Matrimony,
no present taking or making of Husband and Wife DD. in c. ex literis. el. 1. de
Sponsa. extra. Melchi or Kling. Tract. de Cause. Matrim. fol. 1. Jo. Frigeus.
Tract. de Spons. in fin. lib. Instit. Jur. Civil. fol. 272.
, nor that present Bond or Assurance which can never be dissolved, consisting
of present Consent, as the only Cause and Essence thereof L. Nuptias ff. de
Reg. Jur. c. sufficiat 27. q. 2.
. The reason wherefore it is otherwise, when the words (albeit of the future
time) do sound of the end and execution of the Marriage, shall then appear,
when we shall entreat of the Form of Spousals de praesenti infra. 11.
.

5. Now forasmuch as there be diverse, both Divines Martin. Luther. in libello
de cause. Matrimon.
and Professors of either Law Schneid. Tract. de Nuptiis, fol. 19. Jo. Frigeus
de Sponsal. in fin. lib. Instit. Jur. Civil. Heming. Goden. l. 2. consil. Matr.
consil. ibidem 10. Moral. Tract. de Matrimonio, fol. 30.
which do condemn the difference which is here put betwixt these words [ I
will, and I do] affirming, That if the Party contracting say [I will take thee
to my Wife] it is in effect as if he had said [I do take thee to my Wife,] and
so imports Spousals de praesenti, being in truth and substance indissoluble
Matrimony. Therefore e're I proceed to the Ampliations and Limitations of the
former Conclusion, I think it expedient to examine this Question, Whether there
be any such difference betwixt these two Phrases, viz. [I will take thee] and
[I do take thee] as is above described, Yea or No.

6. The first Reason or Foundation whereupon their Opinion is builded, which
held That there is no difference, is this, namely, Because in this Sentence
[Ego volo accipere te in uxorem] I will take thee to my Wife, both the Verbs
[Volo] and [Accipere] are of the Present Tense Heming. Goden. lib. 2. consil.
Matrimo. consil. ibidem 1. n. 4. Schneid. Tract. de Nuptiis, fol. 19. Moral.
Tract. de Matrimonio, fol. 30.
, and not any word of the Future Tense; and so the Sentence is in effect as if
the Party had expressly said [I will at this present, or from henceforth now
take thee for my Wife Goden and Schneidwin, ubi supra. Jo. Frigeus de Sponsal.
fol. 274. in fin. lib. sui Institut. Jur. Civil. Morald. ubi supra.
]. But if any man shall expressly say [I will at present, or from henceforth
take thee for my Wife] It is all one as if he said [I do take thee for my Wift
Praepos. in c. ex literis el. 1. n. 4. verb. secundo modo. in fin.
,] and consequently there is no difference whether the Party say [I will take,
or do take thee].

7. I will not say this kind of reasoning so strictly from Tenses savoureth of
a bare Grammarian, for I esteem otherwise of the Men, than of naked
Grammarians; nor will I enquire wherefore translating these words [I will take,
etc.] into Latin, they choose rather to say [Volo accipere] than [Accipiam,] let
the best advantage be taken to further Matrimony c. fin. de Reg. Jud. c. ex
part de Spons. extra. and ibi DD. lib. 1. consil. matrimonial. consil. ibidem
52. n. 6.
; nor will I stand upon this Point, whether it be all one to say thus [I will
now at this present] or [from henceforth take,] or thus [I do take,] say there
is not any difference Praepos. in c. ex literis el. 1. n. 4. verb. Item nisi.
; nor will I deny the Verb [Volo] to be of the Present Tense; say it is so
Goden. lib 2. consil. matrimon. consil. ibidem 1. n. 4. Schneid. Tract. do
Nuptiis, fol. 19.
; What is it then that I do deny in the former Reason forsooth? That these
words [volo accipere] I will take, imports thus much, [I will now, or from
henceforth take] this I deny: If it be urged, That both the Verbs are of the
Present Tense, therefore [volo accipere] is as much as [I will take now
presently Lib. 2. consil. matrim. consil. ibidem 1. n. 4. Schneid. Tract. de
Nuptiis. fol. 19. Morald. Tract. de Matrim. fol. 30.
,] I deny the Argument: For Verbs of the Present Tense have not always the
force of the Present Tense, but sometimes of the Future Tense c. unic.. 1. de
despons. impub. lib. 6. and ibi Gem. and Phil. Franc. DD. in c. ex literis de
Sponsal. extra.
, no more than Verbs of the Future Tense have always the force of the Future
Tense, but sometimes of the Present Tense, as hereafter appears. And to this
effect is that which Anto. de Butrio and Praepositus, with others, do write of
the Verb (Volo) in these words, Sciendum est ante omnia quod verbum [Volo] de
sui natura semper denotat voluntatem, sed quandoque voluntatem suspensivam de
futuro, quandoque voluntatem dispositivam de praesenti Praepos. post. Anto. de
Butr. in c. ex literis el. 1. de despons. extra. nu. 6.
: Before all things this must be known, that the Verb [Volo] does of its own
nature lib. 1. consil. matr. consil. ibidem 60. nu. 16. and lib. 2. consil.
ibidem 17. n. 8. Summa Silvestr. verb. matrimonium, el. 2. q. 9.
always import a Will, but sometimes a Will suspensive of that which is to
come, and sometimes a Will disposing of that which is present. The like is said
of the Infinitive Mood, of the which it is thus written; Verbum autem
infinitivum nihil perfect significat, sed secundum alia verba determinabitur
ad praesens vel ad futurum Summa Silvestr. verb. matrimonium, 2. q. 9. Jas. in
L. servi electione, de leg. 1. ff. Panor. in d.c. ex literis, nu. 5.
: The Infinitive Mood signifies nothing perfectly, but is by the direction of
other words determined or referred to that which is present or to come: For
Example, a Man says [volo vendere] I will sell, notwithstanding that both the
Verbs are of the Present Tense, yet have they not any force but of the Future
Tense; or as if he had said [vendam] I will sell hereafter Gloss. in l. In
vendentis C. de contrahend. Emption. DD. in L. Servi electione de leg. 1. ff.
. If any do not conceive my meaning by this Example to this Man, I put this
plain Case: Another Man being indebted unto him xxl. says unto him [volo
solvere] I will pay; whether is this a Payment of his Debt, yea or no? I know
he will say it is not Lib. 2. consil. matr. consil. ibidem 2. nu. 6.
; and withal Reply, That when the thing cannot be satisfied by Words, or by
Will only, but by an Act following, then these words must be understood of that
Act which is to come Gloss. in l. In vendentis C. de contrahend. Emp. Bar. in
l. Servi electione ff. de leg. 1. Col. fin. Card. in c. ex literis. de Sponsal.
extra. op. 3.
; but when the Case is such, that it does not necessarily expect a future Act,
but may be then accomplished without any subsequent Act, (as in Contracts of
Matrimony, which Matrimony is made perfect by Will or present Consent only) in
this Case the words have force of present time Cardinal. in c. ex literis. de
Sponsal. extra. op. 3.
. To this Reply, thus I make this Rejoinder; Albeit that Case of [volo solvere]
I will pay, does much differ from this Case [volo accipere te in uxorem] I will
take thee for my Wife de in l. Cunctos C. de Summa Trin. and in L. Servi
electione ff. de leg. 1.
; yet in these Cases which are absolutely perfected by Consent alone, and which
do merely depend of the Will of the Speaker, even in these Cases the Verb
[volo] joined to the Infinitive Mood, signifying the beginning, and not the end
or execution of an Act, has no more force but of the Future Tense. The Truth
of which Conclusion may be proved by infinite Testimonies Bar. Alex. Paul. Jos.
Ripa. and alii. in d. L. Servi elect. Futr. Jo. And. Panor. and Praepos. in c.
ex literis. de Sponsal. extra.
, I will produce but two Witnesses for all: The first an excellent Legist and
Linguist, namely Alciate, has these words; Quoties de Actu tractatur qui a
nostra pendet voluntate verbum [volo] cum Infinitivo adjunctum non disponit,
sed primum voluntatis motum innuit, veluti cum dico [volo eligere talem] non
ideo eligo, vel cum dico [volo adire haereditatem,] non censeor adiisse; sic
reus qui dicit [volo confiteri] non censetur his verbis confessus; sic cum quis
dicit [volo relinquere Centum Titio] hoc solo non videtur reliquisse (ut
receptior se habet Summa) Sic [volo Contrahere Matrimonium cum Titia] non
creditur contraxisse, and siqua similia, non tamen procedit Conclusio, quando
verbum Infinitivi habet posteriorem significationem Alciat. in d. L. Servi
electione.
: As often as that Act is handled which depends of our Will, the Verb [volo] I
will] being joined with an Infinitive Mood, does not dispose, but signify the
first motion of Will: As when I say [volo eligere] I will chuse] I do not
therefore choose; or when I say [volo adire haereditatem] I will undergo the
Executorship] I am not therefore denied to have undertaken it; as also when the
Defendant, which says [volo confiteri] I will confess] is not by these words
judged, as having confessed; or as when any says, [volo relinquere Centum
Titio, etc.] I will leave an hundred pound to John at Style] does not seem by
this only to have bequeathed it (as the more received Opinion does hold); or as
when a Man says [volo contrahere Matrimonium, etc.] I will contract Matrimony
with Jannet at Style] he is not thereby thought to have contracted; and such
like. Notwithstanding, this Conclusion does not proceed when the Verb of the
Infinitive Mood has an after signification, that is sounding of the end and
execution. The second Witness is Panormitan (the Captain of the Canonists)
whose words are these: Verbum Infinitivum aptum est comprehendere tempus
praesens aut futurum, secundum verba adjecta; nam de se Infinitivum verbum
nihil perfect significat, etc. unde si verbo [volo] adjiciatur Infinitivum,
denotans Actum non dependentem a sola voluntate proferentis, tunc non inducitur
dispositio de praesenti, sed declaratur dispositio in futurum, veluti si dico
[volo ascendere arborem] sed si verbo [volo] adjiciatur verbum Infinitivum
denotans Actum dependentem a sola voluntate proferente, tunc aut verba denotant
principium Actus, and non inducitur dispositio de praesenti; utpote si dicam
[volo te disponsare, seu tecum contrahere, etc.] aut denotant executionem
Actus, and tunc inducitur dispositio de praesenti, etc. Panor. in c. ex
literis. el. 1. de Sponsal. extra. nu. 5.
. A Verb of the Infinitive Mood is apt to comprehend the present or future
time, according to the words joined thereunto; for the Infinitive Mood does
signify nothing perfectly of it self, whereupon, if unto the Verb [Volo, I
will] be joined an Infinitive Mood, signifying an Act, which does not depend of
(or is not accomplished by) the sole Will of him that speaks, then is not
present disposition induced, but a suture purpose declared: As if I say, [I
will climb into a Tree] but if unto the Verb [volo, I will] be joined a Verb of
the Infinitive Mood, signifying an Act solely depending on the Will of the
Speaker: Then either the words do import the beginning of an Act, and present
disposition is not induced: As if I say [I will espouse thee] or [I will
contract with thee] or else they do import the execution of an Act, and then
present disposition is induced. These two Witnesses being omni exceptione
majores, I shall not need to use any further Testimony L. ubi ff. de probac.
, unless the Case were more doubtful than I conceive it to be, by occasion of
this Grammatical Argument deduced from the Tenses of the Verb [volo] or the
Infinitive Mood; wherefore we will now come to their other Argument, and see
whether it be of any greater force than the former.

8. The second Argument is drawn from the Simplicity of the Vulgar sort, who
albeit they intend to tie such a Knot as can never be loosed, and make the
Contract so sure as it may never de dissolved; yet such is their unskilfulness
and ignorance herein, that they cannot frame their words to their minds, nor
know whether it be all one to say [I will take thee to my Wife] or [ I do take
thee to my Wife Goden. lib. 2. consil. matrim. Consil. 1. n. 4. lib. 1. consil.
matrim. consil. 52. nu. 5. Schneid. Tract. de Nuptiis, fol. 19. lib. 1. Consil.
matr. consil. ibidem 52. nu. 5.
] much less do they know the difference betwixt these words [I will marry thee]
and [ I will have thee to my Wife] or betwixt these words [ I will take thee to
my Wife] and [ I will hold thee for my Wife] or betwixt these words [I will
espouse thee] and [I will entreat thee as my Wife] or betwixt these words [I
will contract Matrimony with thee] and [I will provide for thee as my Wife] or
betwixt these words [I will make thee my Wife] and [thou shall be my Wife] with
an hundred such differences wherein appears no dissimilitude. And therefore,
since it is the very Consent of Mind only which makes Matrimony L. Nuptias de
Reg. Jur. ff. c. sufficiat 27. q. 2. c. cum apud. de Sponsal. extra.
, we are to regard not their Words, but their Intents, not the formality of the
Phrase, but the drift of their Determination, not the outward sound of their
Lips, which cannot speak more cunningly, but the inward Harmony or Agreement of
their Hearts, which mean uprightly c. ex literis el. 1. de Sponsal. extra. c.

aliter.. 1. ff. de leg. 3.
, whose Sayings are to be expounded with all favor to the furtherance of
Matrimony c. ex literis, etc. ex part, de Sponsal. extra. and ibi DD.
, otherwise if we shall curiously descant upon every word proceeding from a
simple Conceit, we cannot but miss of their meanings, and with our fine and
dainty Distinctions (which never came within the compass of their gross
Understandings) incumber the Consciences of them which be coupled Jo. Frigeus
de Sponsal. in fin. lib. Institut. Jur. Civil. fol. 274.
; whereas in these Contracts of Matrimony, whereupon depends the peril of
Soul, we are before all things to labor diligently to set their Consciences at
liberty Lib. 2. consil. matrim. consil. ibidem 19. nu. 7.
. Lest therefore any Man's Conscience (through ignorance of Terms) might be
entangled in the Snares of this subtle and more captious Distinction of [ I
will, and I do] with the rest of the Differences more subtle and more captious
than this; worthily, and upon just cause (as it seems) are the same to be
rejected, and this reasonable and conscionable Conclusion received, Vbi duo
intendunt contrahere Sponsalia de praesenti, ibi semper contrahitur
Matrimonium, licet verba sonent consensum de futuro tantum Summa Angel. verb.

: Where two intend to Contract Spousals de praesenti, there is Matrimony always
contracted, although the words import but future Consent only. To which
Argument thus I answer.

9. True it is, we are not to stand upon Terms, but upon truth c. ex literis de
Sponsal. extra. L. semper in stipulationibus. de Reg. Jur. ff. and ibi Hiero.
Franc. in Fin.
, and any words will suffice to Contract Matrimony, so that the meaning do
appear Henr. Boic. in c. ex part. de Sponsal. extra. col. 1. Summa Hostiens.
Tit. de Matrimonio. qualiter col. 7.
. But herein is the Argument faulty, here is petitio principij De petitione
principii succincte Oldendorp. Topic. legal. eod. loco.
, whiles it is presupposed that these Parties did intend to Contract Matrimony,
because of the rudeness or simplicity: For how can we know a Man's meaning but
by his words Lib. 2. consil. Matrimonial. consil. ibidem 29. nu. 28. quod velim
videas DD. in c. Tua. de Sponsal. extra. Baldus in L. si non Convitij C. de
Injuriis.
? shall we, if a simple man say one thing, conclude that he did mean another
thing? furely this were a very strange and preposterous Collection L labeo.

cujus consil. extant in lib. 2. consil. matrimonial. and est consilium ibidem

? Indeed if this meaning of the Parties may appear, namely, That they did
intend to Contract Matrimony, then although the words import no more but
Spousals de futuro, the Contract is no less than Matrimony Henr. Boic. in c.
per tuas. col. 1. de Sponsal. extra. Card. in c. ex literis eod. Tit. Summa
Angel. verb. Matrimonium 2. n. 13.
; but when this meanning does not appear, then, howsoever the Rude and Vulgar
sort do often abuse their terms, and speak improperly, we must be directed by
the Text, which says, Non aliter a significatione verborum recedi oportet,
quam si manifestum sit aliud sensisse proferentem L. non aliter. ff. de leg. 3.
Braecheus in Rub. de Verb. Sig. ff. nu. 25.
: We must not otherwise depart from the signification of words, but in case it
be manifest, that the Speaker meant otherwise. And to the same effect is it
which Panormitan writes, in these words, Nota contra Rusticos, qui post
perfectum Contractum, dicunt se non concepisse vim verborum, debent eadem verba
habere suam vim and proprietatem, secundum Juris Dispositionem, nec excusat
contrahentem Juris Ignorantia, unde si alter contrahentium diceret, quod
credebat contrahere per illa verba Sponsalia, and non Matrimonium, vel e
contra, non est sibi acquiescendum, sed accipientur verba secundum rectum and
verum intellectum Panor. in c. ex literis. el. 1. de Sponsal. extra. n. 4.
Cave. per d. consil. viz. 52. lib. 1. consil. ma. and consil. 1. vol. 2.
: Note against Rusticks, which after a perfect Contract say, they did not
conceive the force of the words; for their words ought to enjoy their force and
propriety according to the disposition of Law; neither does Ignorance of Law
excuse the Party contracting; whereupon if the one Party should say that he did
intend to contract Spousals, and not Matrimony; or contrariwise (that is to
say, Matrimony and not Spousals) it is not to be yielded unto him, but the
words shall be taken according to their right and true understanding. Here I
might also add that notable saying of noble Baldus, of whom for his Universal
Knowledge in every thing, it is recorded (to his immortal Commendation) quod
nihil ignoravit, that he was ignorant of nothing; his words are short, but
sharp; Rusticus debet ire ad Civitatem pro Consilio, sicut ad Sylvam pro
lignis, alias non excusatur ignorantia Juris Bald. in l. Juris ignorantiae. C.
qui admitti. n. 1.
: The Country man ought to repair to the City for Counsel, as to the Wood for
Fuel, otherwise he is not excused through Ignorance of Law Inno. in c. ex
literis. el. 1. de Spons. extra.
. But lest this Answer may seem more sharp than short, I will endeavor to
satisfy their rough humor by some milder means than by stiff Authority, yet
not betraying the Truth. Know therefore, that these Distinctions betwixt words
of the present and future time, and likewise betwixt words signifying the
beginning and execution of any Act, are so far from the nature and property of
Snares and Gynns, whereby to catch or entrap any Man at advantage against his
meaning, or to incumber his Conscience with subtilty, that on the contrary,
they may well be compared unto the Thread which Ariadne gave unto Theseus; for
as without that Thread he could never have escaped out of that endless
Labyrinth, wherein were so many difficult Turnings and intricate Returnings,
and Windings to and fro innumerable, and but one only Out-gate; so without
Distinctions it is impossible to escape out of the confused Maze of such
intricate Questions and infinite Errors, amongst the which there is but one
only Truth: By Distinctions we discern the Scent and Footsteps (as it were) of
each Man's purpose and intent, thereby, like Bloodhounds, we are taught to
trace and hunt out the very Center of each Man's thought Alciat. lib. 2. de

, so far as it is possible with Human Industry, though the way be never so
intricate: By Distinctions are ambiguous Questions resolved, confused Matters
separated, Things variable discerned, and dark and obscure Enigma's cleared and
made bright Alciat. ubi supra. L. apud C. de furtis, and ibi DD.
. By Distinctions we apprehend the true meaning, not of Men only, but of God
himself, as without the which the true meaning and sense of Scriptures cannot
be attained Distingue tempora and concordabunt Scripturae, Bart. Bald and alii
in L. apud C. de furtis.
: Nay more, without Distinctions neither the Law, neither the Gospel, can stand
or be defended from Contrariety, I had almost said from Falsity Alciat. de
Verb. Sig n. lib. 2. fol. 49.
. Hence it is, that Distinctions are termed (of some) the next Neighbors of
Truth Mantic. de Conjectur. ultim. volunt. lib. 8. Tit. 3. n. 9.
, being skilful and faithful Guides whereby Men escape the Erroneous Bypath
of False Opinions, and are, at the least, brought unto the place where Truth is
secretly seated Alciat. ubi supra. DD. in d. l. apud.
: Wherefore seeing the use of Distinctions is so necessary, as thereby we are
directed to the Truth of each Man's meaning, when other Means do fail, how can
we with safe Conscience speak against Distinctions, unless we are able to show
this meaning, whereby we discern Men's Consciences and the secret meanings of
the Parties, by other more certain means than by a simple Argument, drawn from
the simplicity of the Persons contracting: For what a simple Argument, and how
unworthy such Patrons is this, The Parties are simple or ignorant Persons which
did Contract by these words [ I will take thee, etc.] Ergo, they did intend to
Contract Matrimony, and not Spousals de futuro; what else (in God's Name) is
this but principium petere, and ignotum per ignotius probare?

10. There remains yet one doubt to be absolved which is this. When the
parties do Contract by these words [I will take thee to my Wife] and [I will
take thee to my Husband, etc.] not expressing the time when, is it not all one
as if either of them had said [I do take], seeing when no day is expressed, the
thing promised or Act covenanted is to be done presently Olden. Topic. legal.
loco a petitione principii, L. In omnibus obligationibus. de Reg. Jur. ff.
Instit. de verb. oblig.. omnis Stipulatio. L. cedere diem. ff. de Verb. Sign.
.

11. I Answer, the parties are presently bound so far forth as the weak Bond of
Spousals de futuro can tie them Summa Hostiens. Tit. de Sponsal. quis sit
effectus. in princ. c. 2. c. ex literis el. 2. de Sponsal. extra and ibi Panor.
; but they are not at all tied with that indissoluble knot or Bond of
Matrimony, because as yet they have not Contracted Matrimony Ergo Sublata
Causa, tollitur effectus. Olden. and Everard. loco a Causa.
, for each several Contract does bring forth a several Bond or Obligation,
whereof it is the Mother Siquidem cum ex contractu nasci obligationem legimus,
L. 1. de Action. and Oblig. ff. Contract. Obligationis matrem non inepte
dicimus.
; So long then as the Mother (that is the Contract) is unbegotten, so long the
Daughter, (that is the Bond or Obligation) must needs be unborn. These things
considered, I conclude, That it is not all one to say [I will take thee to my
Wife] and [I do take thee to my Wife]; And that by the Form of words, [I will
take thee, etc.] Spousals de futuro and not de praesenti are Contracted; which
Conclusion notwithstanding as it is diversely enlarged, so on the contrary it is
restrained in diverse Cases.

12. The First Ampliation is collected out of the Premises, that is to say,
albeit the parties contracted be rude and simple persons, yet these words [I
will take thee, etc.] import no more but Spousals de futuro Panor. in c. ex
literis el. 1. de Sponsal. extra n. 4.
, unless it be otherwise proved that they did intend to Contract Spousals de
praesenti DD. in d.c. ex literis. Cave.
.

13. The Second Ampliation is, albeit the Parties instead of the Verb [volo, I
will] do use the Verb [promitto, Summa Rosell. verb. Matrimonium. el. 3. col.
2. lib. 1. consil. matr. consil. ibidem 60. nu. 16.
I promise] or the Verb [placet Panor. in c. ex literis. el. 1. de Sponsal.
extra. n. 5. and ibi Praepos n. 6. in princ.
, it pleases or likes me] or [contentus sum Lib. 1. consil. matrim. Consil
ibidem. 60. nu. 16.
, I am content]; wherefore if the parties respectively say [ I promise to take
thee, or I am pleased to take thee, or I am content to take thee, etc.] these
words or phrases import no more than [ Volo accipere te, etc. I will take thee,
etc. Panor. and Prepos. in d. c. ex literis lib. 1. Consil. matr. consil. ibid.
60. nu. 16.
].

14. The Third Ampliation is, that albeit the Parties do confirm the Contract
with an Oath, yet the same Contract being made by the words aforesaid, the
nature thereof is not altered c. requisivit. de Sponsal. extra. Covar. Tract.
de Sponsal. prima part. c. 5. in princ.
. And therefore if the Parties say, [ I give thee my Faith and Troth to Marry
thee Lib. 1. Consil. matrim. Consil. ibidem. 60. nu. 16.
, or I swear unto thee to take thee to my Wife, etc.] this is but Spousals de
futuro Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. prima part. c. 5. in princ.
.

15. The Fourth Ampliation is this, namely when either party does say [promitto
tibi Matrimonium, I do promise thee Marriage] for this is no more but Spousals
de futuro Heming. Goden. inter Consil. Matrimonial. lib. 2. Consil. ibidem. 2.
nu. 6.
; nor is it all one to say [I do promise Matrimony] and [I do Contract
Matrimony] no more than it is all one to say [I will Marry] and [I do Marry
Eod. consil.
].

16. The Fifth Ampliation is when Children are Married together, for then
albeit they use words of the present time, as [I do take thee, etc.] yet by
Interpretation of Law these are no more but Spousals de futuro c. unic.. 1. de
despons. impub. lib. sexti and ibidem Gem. and Franc.
.

17. The Sixth Ampliation is, when after the speaking of such words as induce
Spousals de futuro, the parties do add other words, which otherwise of
themselves induce Spousals de praesenti; for Example. The one party says [ I
do promise that I will Marry thee, and I will hold thee for my Lawful Wife],
and the other party answers, and [ I promise that I will Marry thee, and I
will hold thee for my lawful Husband Specul. Tit. de Sponsal. in princ. n. 7.
Panor. in c. ex part de Spons. extra Summa Rosella. verb. Matrimonium 3. col.
2. Summa Silvestr. verb. Matrimonium. 2. q. 9. in fin. lib. 1. consil.
Matrimonial. Consil. ibidem. 83. n. 25.
]. Which words [ and I will hold thee, etc.] being uttered alone, do induce
Matrimony Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. Secunda part, c. 4.. 1. n. 4. Panor. in c.
veniens el. 2. de Sponsal. extra. n. 3. and in c. ex part eod. Tit. n. 7.
Praepos. in c. ex literis el. 1. de Sponsal. extra. nu. 6. in fin.
; but here they are restrained by the words foregoing Panor. in c. ex part
despons. extra. n. 7. Arg. l. ultim.. cui dulcia ff. de Tritic. vin. et el.
legate. Alex. con. 152. vol. 5. lib. 1. consil. matrim. consil. 83. n. 10.
, which are to be regarded as Principal, and the words following, as accessory;
and so in this instance they induce no more, but Spousals de futuro Specul. in
Rub. de Sponsal extra. Summa Rosella. and Summa Silvestr. ubi supra lib. 1.
consil. matrim. consil. Ibidem. 83. n. 25. Alex. consil. 152. vol. 5. n. 5.
Menoch. de presump. lib. 3. presump. 3. n. 4. Romans singul. 338.
, according to the nature of the former words [I will Marry thee, etc.]

18. The Seventh Ampliation is when the parties do use these or the like words,
[I will take no other Woman to my Wife but thee, and I will take no other Man
to my Husband but thee Alex. cons. 152. vol. 5. n. 3, and 4. lib. 1. consil.
matrim. Consil. ibidem. 52. n. 1, 2, 5.
], for it is in effect as if he or she had said [ I will tak^ thee and no other
Siquidem haec dictio [nisi] post orationem negativam posita ponit and affirmat
exceptum, Spiegel. Lexic. verb. nisi. L. 2.. fin. ff. de Custod reorum. Jas. in
L. Actio C. de Transac. and Alex. d. cons. 152 lib. 1. consil. Matrim. consil.
52. n. 2. Ripa. Resp. 71.
], howbeit this Ampliation does not pass without difficulty, as hereafter more
fully shall appear Infra.
.

19. The Eighth Ampliation is, that if either Party do not repeat the same
words, viz. the one of them saying, [ I will Marry thee, or I will take thee to
my Wife, or I will Contract Matrimony with thee, etc.] The other answering [ I
am content, or I am pleased, etc.] hereby are Spousals de futuro Contracted c.
si iater. de Sponsal. extra. and ibi Panor. and Praepos.
, as if both parties had used the self same words.

20. The Ninth Ampliation is, that albeit the one party use no words at all,
but signify his or her consent by some Signs, as if the one party say [ I do
promise to Marry thee, and if thou be content to Marry me, then kiss me, or
give me thy hand]; Whereupon the other party kissing or giving hand
accordingly, Spousals are thereby Contracted Henr. Boic. in c Tuae. de Sponsal.
extra. col. 2. lib. 2. consil. Matrimo. consil. ibidem. 34. n. 5. Summa
Silvestrin. verb. Matr. 2. n. 8. Summa Angelic. verb. Matrimonium. el. 2. q. 4.
in fin.
.

21. The Tenth Ampliation is, that Spousals are sometimes Contracted without
express mention of future Marriage, or taking to Husband and Wife, etc. viz.
when the parties mutually use these words [ I will receive thee for my own c.
pen. de Sponsal. extra.. verum. dec. consil. 368, n. 2.
].

22. Finally, if a Man, taking a Woman by the hand, do say unto her, (I give
thee my Faith that I will take thee to my Wife] albeit the Woman say nothing,
yet is the Man bound to Marry her if she will; but the Woman is not to be
compelled if she will not Boer. consil. 40. n. 22. Summa Rosella. verb.
Sponsal. in princ. Summa Angel. Eod n. 19.
, unless it be proved at least by some Sign, that the Woman did consent; as if
there were some Treatise before of Spousals to be Contracted betwixt them; or
if she being required, did willingly give her hand to receive his promise Summa
Rosella. ubi supra. Addic. Ad Hostiens. in Tit. de Sponsal.. quot sunt. litera
(b) and Boer. d. cons. 40. n. 22. Andr. Barb. consil. 6. vel. 1.
; Where I said that the Man is tied if the Woman will, albeit she said nothing
Silvestr. Prier. verb. Sponsalia. in princip.
, that is true, if she will immediately after the Contract, otherwise it is not
in her power afterward.

23. The First Limitation of the former Rule is, when it appears that the
Parties did intend to Contract Matrimony; For albeit the words import no more
but Spousals de futuro, of their own Nature; yet by reason of the intent and
present Consent (which alone is sufficient) Matrimony is thereby Contracted
Summa Hostiens. Tit. de Matrimonio.. qualiter. col. 7. Summa Angel. verb.
Matrimonium. el. 2. n. 13. Henr. Boic. in c. ex part. despons. extra. col. 1.
lib 1. consil. Matrim. consil. 52. n. 3.
. This Limitation is very General, the rest are more special, and do help to
declare this intent and meaning.

24. The Second Limitation is, when the Contract is made by way of
Interrogation and Answer, for then the Answer being made deliberately by this
Word [volo] I will, does induce Matrimony Covar. Epitom. de Sponsal. secunda
part c. 4.. 1. n. 4. Part. in l. gerit. ff. de acquir. haered. DD. in L. Servi
electione. ff. de leg. 1.
; Albeit the other Verb has relation to the beginning, not the Execution of
Matrimony; for Example. The Man demanding of the Woman whether she will take
him to her Husband, she answers [I will]: And the Woman likewise demanding
whether he will take her to his Wife, he answers [I will], in this Case
Matrimony and not Spousals is Contracted Covar. ubi Supra. Praepos. in c. ex

de Arb. Jud. lib. 2. centur. 5. cas. 496. n. 31 qui refert hoc procedere facta
interrogatione ab ipsis contrahen. secus si ab altero.
.

25. The third Limitation is, when the Contract is made after Treatise of
Matrimony to be had betwixt the Parties Cardinal. in Clem. unic. de Consang. q.
20. Covar. Epitom. de Sponsal. secunda part c. 4.. 1. n. 4. vide DD. in l. si
quis cum aliter. de verb. Oblig. ff. Add Sanchez. Tract. de Matrimonio lib. 1.

; in which Case, by these words [ I will marry thee, or I will take thee to my
Wife, etc.] Matrimony is induced Cardinal. and Covar. ubi supra lib. 2. consil.

Jos. and Imol. in L. si quis cum aliter de verb. Oblig. ff. and Zas. in L. 1..

.

26. The fourth Limitation is, When as over and above the words, there is an
Accumulation of some Act joined therewithal, whereby those Spousals do pass
into Matrimony Lapus Allegat. 57.
. For Example: The Parties saying [I will Contract Matrimony with thee, etc.]
by and by the Man delivers to the Woman a Ring, and does put it on her fourth
Finger; hereby the Contract is presumed Matrimonial Lapus de Allegat. 57.
; howbeit this Conclusion is not very sound Immo si Annuli traditio sequatur

Add Sanchez. Tract. de Matrimonio, lib. 1. Disp. 18. n. 27.
.

27. The fifth Limitation is, When the Parties do use this word from henceforth
Praepos. in c. ex literis el. 1. col. 2. verb. Item nisi ex verbis.
in the Contract; as [I will from henceforth take thee, etc.] for it is in
effect as if they had said [I do take thee, etc.] inducing present Consent

.

28. The sixth Limitation is, When as by common use of Speech the words induce
Matrimony; for the propriety of words ought to give place to the common use and
acceptance thereof in this matter Cardinal. in c. ex literis. de Sponsal.
extra. in. fin. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 4.. 1. n. 4.
Praepos. in d. c. ex literis, col. 2. verb. Item nisi communis. lib. 2. Consil.
matr. consil. ibidem 1. n. 2.
: If therefore while the Parties do say [ I will marry thee, or I will Contract
Matrimony with thee, etc.] it be the use and custom of that place by these
words to Contract Matrimony (although the words of their own nature induce no
more than Spousals) indissoluble Matrimony is thereby contracted DD. in d. c.
ex literis, and in c. ex part. de Sponsal. extra. Jacob. Leoniss. inter
consil. matrimonial. lib. 1. consil. ibidem 52. quod ommno velim te videre.
.

29. The seventh Limitation is, When it is doubtful whether the words uttered
by the Parties import Spousals de futuro or Matrimony, being apt and
indifferent, by reason of the double sense thereof, to signify either the one
or the other. In which Case, that Sense is to be received which makes for
Matrimony Praepos. in c. ex part, n. 6. in fin. de Sponsal. extra. lib. 1.

import no more but Spousals de futuro Galat. inter consil. matrimonial. lib. 1.

30. The eighth Limitation is, When the words do savor of the Execution of
Marriage, as [I will have thee for my Wife, etc. c. ex part de Sponsal. extra.
and ibi DD.
]

31. The ninth Limitation is, When the Parties, after they have contracted
Spousals de futuro, have Carnal Knowledge together; for thereby the former
Contract does pass, and is (by interpretation of Law) transferred into
Matrimony c. is qui fidem. c. veniens. el. 2. de Spons. extra. Melch. Kling.

SECT. XI. By what Form of Words Spousals de praesenti (being in substance
Matrimony) are contracted.
1. WE must neither forget the two former Distinctions, viz. That of words used
in contracting Spousals; some are of the present time, some of the future time
supra.. prox. c. si inter de Sponsal. extra.
. And Secondly, That some words have relation to the entrance or beginning, and
some to the end or execution of Marriage Panor. Praepos. and alii in c. ex
part, de Sponsal. extra. Specul. in Rub. de Sponsal. in princ. lib. 1. consil.
Matrimon. consil. ibidem 60. and lib. 2. consil. 17.
: The Examples whereof are before deliverd: Whereunto it may now, Thirdly be
added, That some words have respect neither to the beginning nor to the ending,
nor to any Accident, but to the Substance of the Act; as [I will be thy
Husband, etc. Summa Silvestrin. verb. matrimon. 2. q. 9. Ferret. consil. 383.
n. 10. lib. 1. consil. matrimonial. consil. ibidem 84. n. 25. DD. in L. Servi
electione ff. de leg. 1. and ibi Ripa n. 18. Menoch. de praesump. lib. 3.
praesump. 3. n. 5.
]: From which three Distinctions flow three several Conclusions, yet tending to
one and the same end: Which are these.

2. The first Conclusion is, That when the Parties do Contract Spousals by
words of present time; as, [I take thee to my Wife c. pen. de Sponsal. extra.
Menoch. Tract. de praesump. lib. 3. praesump. 3. n. 1.
] or [I hold thee for my Wife Summa Angel. verb. matrimon. 2. n. 13. Abbas. in
c. venias. el. 2. de Sponsal. extra.
] or [ thou art my Wife Melchior Kling. Tract. de causis matrimo, fol. 6.
] or [I consent unto thee, as my supra.. prox.
Wife Specul. lib. 4. in Rub. de Sponsal. in princ. n. 6.
] or [I commend thee for my Wife Specul. ubi supra.
): By these kind of words (being uttered by either Party) are contracted
Spousals de praesenti vide DD. in c. ex literis. el. 1. and in c. ex part and
in c. si inter. de Spons. extra. Menoch. Tract. de praesump. lib. 3. praesump.
3.
; which kind of Spousals (as I have often foretold) are in Truth and Substance
very Matrimony indissoluble supra.. 4. c. conjux. c. cum initiat. 27. q. 2. c.

n. 2. Melchior. Kling. Tract. de cause. Matrimonial. fol. 7. in fin. Panor. and
Felin. in Rub. de Sponsal. extra.
.

3. The second Conclusion is, That when the Parties contracting Spousals, do
use such words of the future time, as have relation to the end or execution of
Marriage; as [I will have thee for my Wife c. ex part de Sponsal. extra. and
ibi Panor. Boic. and Praepos. cum aliis.
] or [I will hold thee for my Wife Inno. in d. c. ex part. Menoch. de

] or [I will keep my Faith unto thee as my Wife Panor. in d. c. ex part, n. 2.
and 3. and ibi Praepos. Specul. and Kling. ubi supra.

contracted DD. in c. ex literis. and in c. ex part. de Spons extra. Menoch. de
praefump. lib. 3. praesump. 3.

: Wherefore like as by confessing the Effect we grant the Cause; so by
promising the end, we are presupposed to have already promised the beginning,
and consequently by the promise of having, holding, entreating, and providing
for, and keeping of Faith, etc. which words respect the end and execution of
Marriage, we are now deemed to have turned over the Leaf, and to be past the
first Lesson, I mean the Promise of Taking, Contracting, Espousing, or
Marrying, which words do savor only of the beginning or entrance into
Matrimony DD. in c. ex literis. etc. ex part, de Sponsal. extra.

, Men without all controversy, excellently learned, and of sharp Judgments,
are of another Opinion, contending earnestly, That by these words, [I will have
thee] or [I will hold thee for my Wife, etc.] Spousals only de futuro are
contracted; affirming, that as by words of present time Spousals de praesenti,
so by words of future time Spousals de futuro are contracted, without any such
Distinction as is above recited, of the beginning or execution of the Act; and
that Spousals de praesenti are not contracted by any other words than such as
do clearly, necessarily, and seriously infer and conclude present and perfect
Consent Magistr. Covar. and Molin. ubi supra.

and [I do take thee to my Wife] as appears in the former Paragraph supra..
proxim.
: But now these Men are so far from confounding the Natures or Effects of those
Terms [I will take] and [I do take, etc.] that on the contrary; they will not
at any hand admit words of the future time to have the force of present time,
or to induce Spousals de praesenti, albeit the same words have respect to the
end or execution of the Act Alciatus Covar. and Molin. cum Lombard. and Hadria.

.

6. The former of these two Opinions, how erroneous it is, and how unworthy the
Patronage of such Learned Writers, is already discoursed supra.. prox.
. And here by order I shall detect the Error of this Opinion likewise, which
thing I would gladly perform, because it seems to be new and singular, and to
oppugn the ancient and received Opinion Communem DD. opinionem, and Consulendo
and Judicando attendendam and amplectendam fore permultis fretus testimoniis
confirmat Anto. Coratius. Tract. de Communi opinione, lib. 2. Inspectione 2.
. Nevertheless, the further I enter into the Consideration of the Controversy,
the further I am from the Accomplishment of my purpose, the aged Walls and
Fortresses, that is to say, the Reasons and Arguments wherewith this ancient
Opinion is defended seeming more weak and feeble, so that they are unable to
resist the force and fresh Assault of the Adversary, at least in every point of
Law: For first and principally this Axiom, Qui vult consequens velle censetur
antecedens De argumento a consequenti Consulas velim. Jo. Oldendorpii Topic.
legal. fol. (lib. mei) 126. and Nichol. Everard. loco a concessione
consequentis.
, being the strongest place of Defense, and the very Gates of the Castle,
wherein is placed the greatest Force, for the Maintenance of the former
Opinion, is by virtue of a strong Distinction (as by the might of some Martial
Engine) in danger to be violently burst open and captivated by the Adversary,
armed with this sharp Sentence; Ego autem tunc praesentem consensum Conjugio
praestitum esse opinor, quando ex verbis prolatis, Consensus is de praesenti
necessario sequitur; At in hac questione, is Consensus non sequitur necessario,
igitur Matrimonium non est, etc. nec obstat illa ratio, Qui enim vult id quod
sequitur, Censetur omnino velle id quod permittitur necessario illo tempore,
quo consequens executioni tradendum est, unde qui habet aliquam faeminam in
uxorem, actu promittit se cum illa Matrimonium contraxisse, non sic ille qui
praesenti tempore actu non habet, sed habere promittit in futuro, etc. Covar.
Tract. de Sponsal. and matr. secunda part. c. 4.. 1. n. 5. versic. Ego autem.
and versic. nec obstat.
. I am verily of Opinion (says he) that present Consent for Marriage is then
performed, when as that present Consent does necessarily follow of the words
spoken: But in this Question, That Consent does not necessarily follow,
therefore it is not Matrimony, nor does that aforesaid Reason withstand; for he
which grants that which follows, is presumed, at the utmost, to grant that
which is necessarily presupposed at that instant wherein the Consequent is to
be put in Execution; whereupon he which indeed has any Woman to his Wife,
promises that he has contracted Matrimony with her; but so does not he which
actually at this present has not a Wife, but promises that he will have
hereafter, etc. By force of which Dictinction, the Gates of the former Axiom
show as if they were cleft asunder, and set wide open, so that we may perceive
and understand, That an Antecedent is only then presupposed, when the
Consequent is actually executed Covar. ubi supra.
, but not before; like as the Cause is then justly presumed, when as the Effect
is indeed really extant, and not before Siquidem effectus absolutam
consummationem seu rei perfectionem significat. Jo. Olden. Topic. legal. loco.
ab effectu.
; and therefore whiles any man says, [Habebo te in Vxorem, I will have thee to
my Wife] (seeing the Promise is not yet executed, but is to be performed
hereafter) he is not yet presumed to have taken her to his Wife, or to have
contracted Matrimony with her in the mean time Covar. ubi supra. Hadr. in 4.
Senten. q 13.
. And hereby also appears the Answer to the Questions formerly demanded, viz.
How can he have or hold her as his Wife, which is not first his Wife? etc.
Whereunto it may be easily answered; That to have, and to hold, and to promise
to have, and to hold, is not all one Covar. ubi supra. and Molin. in addit. ad
Dec. in c. juravit. de probat. extra. qui respondet, quod in his verbis [habebo
te in ux.] subest Conditio, casu quo in futurum velim uxorem ducere; Item aliud

ibidem. 86. n. 17.
: For say, that she cannot truly and properly be had, held, entreated, kept, or
provided for as Wife, which is not first his Wife, of whom she is so had, held,
entreated, kept or provided for Panon. and alii. in c. ex literis. el. 1. etc.
ex part. de Sponsal. extra.
; yet verily a Man may promise that he will have her to his Wife, which as yet
is not his Wife Covar. Hadrian and Molin. ubi supra.
: And although when a Man promises that he will have her, be presently bound
Panor. in d. c. ex part. de Sponsal. extra. n^. and ibi Cardinal. q. 1.
, yet is it fully answered by Covarruvias, Quamvis sic promittens statim
teneatur illam habere in uxorem, dum tamen non habet, Matrimonium non est
Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 4.. 1. n. 5. versi Item quamvis.
. Although he which so promises be forthwith bound to have her for his Wife,
yet whiles he has her not, it is not Matrimony. As for the Chapter Ex part c.
ex part de Sponsal. extra.
, which diverse do urge in confirmation of the common Opinion, it is retorted
upon their own pates; for in the Case proposed in that Chapter it is plain,
that the Man did promise quod eam ab eo tempore pro Conjuge teneret Text. in d.
c. ex part.
, That from that time he would hold her for his Wife; which words [ab eo
tempore] from that time do imply present Consent, and consequently induce
Matrimony Molin. in addit. ad Dec. in c. Juravit. de probat. extra. Covar. de
Sponsal. part secunda, c. 4.. 1. n. 5. versic. ex quo ad Text. etc. Imo vero

, albeit the words otherwise import no more but Spousals de futuro Prae pos. in
c. ex literis. el. 1. de Sponsal. extra. n. 4. verb. Item nisi ex verbis.
. And therefore if the Man say [I will from henceforth take thee to my Wife,]
which words [I will take thee to to my Wife] induce no more but Spousals de
futuro; but by force of this word [from henceforth] present Matrimony is
induced; like as if he had said [I do take thee for my Wife Praepos. ubi supra.
Vide Inno. in c. ex part de Spons. extra.
.] And so the Chapter Ex part, is not of any such importance, as many do
surmise. Thus we may behold how the Foundations of that ancient Opinion are
battered, the Gates opened, and the Adversary entered; and that the same which
heretofore so long triumphed in Peace, and has been so highly advanced, and of
so many honored for the Truth, is now at last strongly besieged, hotly
pursued, greatly distressed, and in danger to be captivated and condemned, as
False and Erroneous, (and if I shall not dissemble) were it not that the Castle
is better furnished with Men than Munition, I mean, if the Patrons and
Favorers of this ancient Opinion, were not in number almost Infinite Cardinal.

, than their Reasons or Arguments strong or forcible, I should conjecture, That
this singular Opinion would quickly prevail and reign as Conqueror; but because
they be so many in number, and in Authority so mighty, because also it is not
absolutely lawful for the Judge to pronounce Sentence, nor for the Advocate to
give Counsel, against the common and received Opinion Corasius Tract. de com.

, it is more safe to Judge for Matrimony than against Matrimony; and less peril
to join them which be free, than to separate them which be bound c. Licet. de
testibus extra. in fin. c. habetur c. scripsit. 27. q. 1.
; the victory is like to rest doubtful. And therefore in the mean time, it were
not far amiss to be unsuspected, saving that the state of this Question being
plainly discovered and brought almost to an Issue, some do perhaps expect that
I should give my Verdict therein, then, of how small moment it is, I easily
grant in a matter of so great moment; but yet to satisfy my Readers request,
and rather than I will be thought a Neuter, this is my present Resolution.

7. That howsoever the singular Opinion does seem more probable or more
sustentable in the very point of Law, in respect of the last, in regard of
[habebit] which must be referred to the future tense only; yet considering the
phrase of our native Language, which does admit no equivocation herein;
therefore I do conclude, when the parties do Contract themselves by such words
as may be referred, not only to the future, but to the present time, as [I will
have thee, etc.] which also have relation to the end and execution of Marriage;
This is Matrimony Panor. and omnes Canonistae in c. ex part. de Spon. sul.
extra.
: For although [ habebo, tenebo, tractabo, etc. which is, I will have, I will
hold, I will entreat, etc.] be referred to the future time; Yet [ volo habere,
volo tenere, volo tractare, etc. which is likewise, I will have, I will hold, I
will entreat, is referred to the time present; And although these words [I will
have thee to my Wife, etc.] being referred to the future time (as if the party
had said [habebo]) it is a question whether they induce Matrimony or Spousals;
Yet being referred to the time present, As if the party had said (volo habere)
it is no question, for ought that I have read, but these words [volo habere te
in uxorem] induce Matrimony Panor. Praepos. and omnes DD. in c. ex literis el.
1. etc. ex part de Sponsal. extra.
: Now then seeing whiles any Man says [I will have thee to my Wife] and [I
will have thee to my Husband] it may be understood [I will now presently have]
as well as [I will have hereafter Lib. 2. consil. matr. consil. ibidem. 1. n. 4.
]; in this Case that Sense is to be embraced, whereby Matrimony is advanced
Anto. de Butr. and DD. in c. 1. ex part de Sponsal. extra. Menoch. de
praesump. lib. 3. praesump. 3. u. 9.
.

8. The Third Conclusion is all one in effect with the second, namely, that
when the parties shall Contract themselves, by such words, as do respect not
any Accident, but the Substance of the Act. As [I will be thy Husband], and [I
will be thy Wife, etc.] hereby (even as by words which have relation to the
Execution of the Act) Spousals de praesenti are contracted lib. 1. consil.
matr. consil. ibidem. 83. n. 25. Silvest. Prier. verb. matrim.. 2. n. 9. Ripa
in L. Servi Electione. ff. de leg. 1. nu. 18. Ferret. consil. 383. n. 10.
.

9. Out of these three Conclusions I collect this general rule, That when the
parties do Contract Spousals by words of present time, or by words of the
future time, having relation to the Execution or Substance of Matrimony, hereby
are Spousals de praesenti Contracted Menochtract. de praesump. lib. 3.
praesump. 3. Panor. and alij in c. ex part de Sponsal. extra.
.

10. The Ampliations and limitations of which rule are these: The first
Ampliation is, that Albeit the words be ambiguous, such as of their own nature
enforce neither Matrimony nor Spousals, but by common use of Speech induce
Matrimony, by these words true and perfect Matrimony is Contracted, as well as
if the words were naturally and properly Matrimonial c. ex literis cl. 1. de
Sponsal. extra. and ibi Cardinal. Jo. And. ibidem. Praepos. in d. c. ex part
n. 7. in fin. per. c. fin. de jud. extra.
. For example; the parties. Contracting use these words, [I will have thee for
my Wife until the Earth cover mine Eyes] for by these words Panor. in d. c. ex
literis n. 5. Covar. Tract. de Spons. 2. part c. 4.. 1. n. 13. Praepos. in. d.
c. ex literis n. 4. verb. tertio modo.
, [until the Earth cover mine Eyes] is commonly understood until I be dead and
buried; and not until the Earth cover mine Eyes, whiles I am yet alive Panor.
Praepos. and Covar. ubi supra.
: So it is if the Parties say [I will not change thee for a better Hostiens. in
c. fin. de sen. and Re. Jud. extra. Silvestr. Prier. verb. matrimonium. 2. n.
10. verb. Quintum Melchior Kling. Tract. de cause. Matrimon. fol. 6. Praepos. in
c. ex part de Sponsal. extra. n. 8.
], or thus, [none shall separate us but death Melchior Kling. Tract. de cause.
Matrimonial. fol. 6. Moraldus tract. de Matrimonio. fol. 29. versic. Sponsalia
vero de praesenti.
], or thus, [I will retain thee perpetually with me Gloss in c. Solet. 32. q.
2. Silvestr. Prier. verb. Matrimonium. 2. n. 10. verb. sextum. lib. 2. consil.
matrimon. Consil. ibidem. 34. n. 3.
], or thus, [here I take thee for mine own Panor. in c. Si inter. de Sponsal.
extra. in fin. and ibi Praepos. n. 2, and 3.
], with a thousand like instances, wherein the obscurity or ambiguity of the
Speech hinders not, but that the common and usual acceptance thereof, does
enforce Matrimony Vide DD. in c. ex literis. cl. 1. c. ex part. and in c. pen.
de Sponsal. extra. and Specul. in Tit. de Sponsal. and Matrimonio.
; neither is it material whether the Man or the Woman speak first Covar. Tract.
de Sponsal. 2. part. c. 4. n. 6. dicit tamen honestum esse ut faemina prius
interrogetur. Potest enim (inquit) contingere, quod foemina requisita a viro ut
eum acciperet maritum, responderet, Accipe tu me prius in uxorem, and tunc
demum Ego te accipiam in virum; Ac cum vir eam express uxorem accepisset,
posset ipsa foemina illum irridere, ac libere refragari.
.

11. Secondly, albeit the words of the Contract properly, or of their own
nature induce Spousals de futuro, as [I will take thee for my Wife, etc.] Yet
if by the Common use of Speech or Custom of the place where the Parties do
dwell, and were contracted, they infer Matrimony; This being proved, the
Contract is of that force, That, if either party should afterward Solemnize
Matrimony with some other person, yet that second Matrimony is unlawful,
although it were confirmed by carnal knowledge, and procreation of Children
lib. 1. consil. matrim. Consil. ibidem. 52. n. 3. verse. Sed dubitatur. and n.
9. verse. Satis evidenter. lib. 2. consil. Matr. ibidem. 17. n. 19.
.

12. Thirdly, when as the words of the Contract are partly doubtful, and partly
undoubted; As [ I will not Marry any other Woman to my Wife, and I do take thee
for my Wife, etc.] howsoever these words of the Contract [I will not Marry any
other Woman to my Wife] be doubtful and obscure, inducing rather Spousals than
Matrimony Alex. consil. 152. vol. 2. lib. 1. consil. Matr. consil. ibidem. 52.

Action C. de Transact. n. 7. qui refert hanc op. esse communem licet ipse
dissentiat. Praep os. in c. ex part de Sponsal. extra. n. 7.
; Nevertheless, forasmuch as the words following are certain, and do
undoubtedly import Matrimony; In this Case, the ambiguous words precedent are
interpreted by the plain and certain words following, and so consequently the
parties are in this instance adjudged to Contract Matrimony Menoch. Tract. de
praesump. lib. 3. praesump. 3. n. 5. Jo. Baptist. Ferretus consil. 86. Idem
Menoch. consil. 366. n. 36. verse. quintus. casus.
; Whereas on the contrary, if the former words had certainly induced Spousals,
and the words following Matrimony, but yet doubtfully, then the words following
had received their interpretation of the words precedent, and so had induced no
more but Spousals de futuro Hostiens. Abbas and Praepos. in c. ex part de
Sponsal. extra. Bom. sing. 338. Dec. in c. Juravit. de Sponsal. extra. Covar.
Tract. de Sponsal. 2. part. c. 4.. 1. nu. 5. in fin.
.

13. Fourthly, albeit he or she had no meaning or intent to Contract Matrimony
(for that perhaps the Man's purpose was no other but to deceive the Woman, and
procure her to yield to his Lust) yet nevertheless, whereas the words of the
Contract being such as do import Matrimony, the Judge is to give no Credit to
his or her protestation of any sinister or sophistical meaning, other than the
natural propriety and usual acceptance of the words do import Hostiens. in c.
ex literis el. ^. de Sponsal. extra. and ibi Panor. n. 6.
; and therefore the words themselves inducing Matrimony, the parties shall be
adjudged thereby to have Contracted Matrimony c. tua nos. de Sponsal. extra.
Hostiens. and Panor. ubi supra. and Praepos. in d.c. ex literis eod. Tit. lib.
2. consil. Matrimonial. consil. ibidem 17. n. 19.
, although (before God) they be not Man and Wife; for he which is the searcher
of the heart does well know their deceit and defect of Mutual Consent Panor. in
d.c. ex literis. el. 1. de Sponsal. extra. n 6. and DD. in d. c. Tua nos.
, without the which, there can be no Matrimony c. Tua nos. de Sponsal. extra.
; and therefore, in his sight, they are not Man and Wife eod. c Tua nos. and
ibi DD. Panor. in d. c. ex literis n. 9.
. But mortal Man cannot otherwise judge of Men's meanings, than by their sayings
c. Tua de Sponsal. extra. lib. 1. consil. matr. consil. 68. n. 9.
, for the Tongue is the Messenger of the heart L. Labeo.. caeterum. ff. de
supell. Legate.
; and although it sometimes delivers a false Message, yet does the Law accept
it for true, when as the Contrary does not otherwise lawfully appear prealleg.
c. Tua nos. de Sponsal. extra. and ibi Panor. Praepos. and alij. lib. 1.
consil. matrim. consil. ibidem. 68. n. 9, 10. Silvestr. Prier. verb. matrim.
el. 4. n. 1.
.

14. Fifthly, albeit he or she having Contracted Matrimony, whether it be by
words of the present time c. si inter. de Sponsal. extra.
, or by words of the future time, having relation to the execution of Marriage
c. ex part. de Sponsal. extra. and ibi DD.
, do afterward Marry some other Person, yet is not the force of the former
Contract thereby abated; but the Party which so Marries another Person (the
same Person being dismissed) is to be compelled to Effect the first Contract d.
c. si inter etc. ex part lib. 1. consil. matrimonial. confil. ibidem. 52. n. 9.
; Which Ampliation is undoubtedly true, the Contract being made by words of the
present time, as [ I take thee to my Wife, and I take thee to my Husband d.c.
si inter. de Sponsal. extra.
]; but being made by words of the future time, as [I will have thee for my
Wife] and [I will have thee for my Husband], howsoever the same words have
relation to the execution of Marriage, the Ampliation does not pass without
difficulty Covar. de Sponsal. secunda part c. 4.. 1. n. 5. Molinaeus in addit.
ad Dec. in c. Juravit. de probat. extra. Mart. in addit. ad Summam Hostiens.
Tit. de Sponsal.. quot sunt species
, as may appear by the former discourse of the second Conclusion, Supra hoc
ipso..
unless the parties had added some other words expressing their present
Consent; as [ I will from henceforth, or from this time have thee to my Wife,
etc. Nam tunc essemus in terminis d. c. ex part de Sponsal. extra.
].

15. Sixthly, albeit both the parties contracting do not use the very same
words, but other words, yet of the same importance, inducing present Consent;
As if the one of them say [I take thee to my Wife], or [I swear that from hence
forth I hold thee for my Wife], and the other answer [I am content Lib. 1.
consil. Matr. consil. ibidem. 42. n. 1. Panor. in c. si inter. de Sponsal.
extra. n. 7. and Praepos. eod. c. n. 2. quorum opinio com. est test Praepos.
ubi supra.
], or [I will have thee for my Husband Text. in c. ex part de Sponsal. extra.
], here is indissoluble Matrimony Contracted, as well as if this party had
repeated the very same words first uttered by that party DD. communiter in c.
si inter. de Sponsal. extra.
.

16. Seventhly, albeit the one party use no words at all, but signify his or
her present Consent by Signs only; As if the one party say [I take thee to my
Wife, desiring if thou likewise do accept me to thy Husband, to receive this
Ring], she receiving the Ring, it is in effect as if she had answered [I do
accept thee for my Husband Gloss. and DD. in c. ultim. de Despons. impub.
extra. Lapus Alleg. 57. Baptist. a Villalob. verb. Matrimonial. n. 37. Menoch.
de praesump. lib. 3. praesump. 2. n. 4.
].

17. Eighthly, albeit neither the one party, nor the other, do utter the words
of the Contract, but some third Person pronouncing the words; As if he say to
the Man [dost thou take this Woman to thy Wife?] and he answer [ yea, or I do,
or what else?] and likewise to the Woman [dost thou take this Man to thy
Husband?] and she answer [yea] or [I do so] or [what else?] it is of the same
Efficacy, as if the Parties themselves had with their own Mouths pronounced all
the words of the Contract, and said respectively [I take thee to my Wife] and
[I take thee to my Husband, etc.] Summa Angel. verb. Matrimonium 2. n. 10.
Hostiens. in c. Sponsam. de Sponsal. extra. lib. 1.. si quis ita. ff. de verb.
oblig. and ibi DD.
. And if the Parents of the Children Contract Matrimony in behalf of the
Children, though the Children say nothing, yet being present and hearing the
same, their silence is a sufficient proof of their Consent c. 1.. ultim. de
Despons. impub. lib. 6. and ibi gloss. and DD.
and approbation.

18. Ninthly, albeit the words of the Contract, neither of their own natural
signification, neither yet by common use and acceptance conclude Matrimony
Verbi gratia dicitur mulieri, [vis talem? vel placet tibi talis?] and ipsa
respondeat [ volo, vel placet] and e contrario dicitur viro [vis ne talem
mulierem? vel [placet tibi talis?] and ipse dicat, [ volo vel placet] Boic. in
c. ex part, de Sponsal. extra.
; Yet whereas the Parties do thereby intend to Contract Matrimony, they are
inseparable Man and Wife Henr. Boic. in d. c. ex part col. 1.
, not only before God, but also before Man; in case their meaning may lawfully
appear Nam quod ad verba attinetparum refert dummodo de Consensu appareat.
Boic. ubi supra. Summa Hostiens. Tit. de Matrimonio.. qualiter in fin. DD. in
c. Tuae de Sponsal. extra.
.

19. Tenthly, albeit there be no Witnesses of the Contract, yet the Parties
having verily, (though secretly) Contracted Matrimony, they are very Man and
Wife before God Everard. consil. xi. lib. 2. consil. matr. consil. ibidem. 24.
n. 2.
; neither can either of them with safe Conscience Marry elsewhere, so long as
the other party lives) c. in fin. 30. q. 5. Everard. ubi supra.
; for proof is not of the Essence of Matrimony Gloss. and DD. in e. Tuae. de
Spons. extra. and in c. 1. and 2 de Cland. Despons. Hiero. Schurf. inter
consil. Matrimon. lib. 2 consil. 24. n. 23.
; and if it were, yet their Consciences shall be as a thousand Witnesses before
the Tribunal of the immortal God c. Custod. etc. Inter. xi. q. 3.
, though it be otherwise in the Judgment of mortal Man c. Judicantem 30. q. 5.
Everard. dict. consil. xi.
. As after more at large appears in the handling of Secret Contracts.

20. The Eleventh Ampliation is, that albeit the Parties do not Contract
Matrimony together at one instant, by speaking and answering immediately one
after another; but that some good distance of time does pass, betwixt the
promise of the one, and of the other; Nevertheless the Party whose promise is
past, not having changed his or her mind, but persevering still in the same
Will, until the other Party have likewise promised, the Contract is of Equal
force, as if they had both consented together, by speaking immediately one
after another: Marry Praepos. in c. dilectus. etc. pen. de Spons. extra. and
ibi Card and Henr. Boic. per c. ult. de procur. in Sext. Covar. Tract. de
Sponsal. secunda part, c. 4. n. 7.
whether, or how long that Party whose promise is already past, is presumed to
continue or persevere in the same mind, is a question not altogether free from
Controversy; the Solution whereof appears in that place where we entreat of
Spousals contracted betwixt them that are absent infra. 13.
.

21. The twelfth Ampliation is, That when the words of the Contract are
indifferent or equally flexible to the signification of Spousals de futuro, or

22. The thirteenth Ampliation is, That albeit this word Husband or Wife be not
expressed, yet is it understood; as when the Parties Contract in this Form

23. The fourteenth Ampliation is, When the Parties are contracted by these
words [ Non habebo aliam in uxorem nisi te, etc. I will not have any other to
my Wife except thee] and [I will not have any other to my Husband except thee]
for, by the Judgment of the greater part, it is in effect as if the Parties had
been contracted by these words [I will have thee to my Wife] I will have thee

Wife except thee] do not enjoy this sense [I will have thee to my Wife Specul.

.] And secondly, if it were granted that these words [I will not have any other
to my Wife except thee] did peaceably enjoy this sense [I will have thee to my
Wife], yet since it is not without doubt and controversy, whether these words
[I will have thee to my Wife, etc.] induce Matrimony ut paulo superius hoc ipso.
.; doubtless it cannot but be doubtful also, whether by these words [I will not
have any other to my Wife except thee] Matrimony be induced; for if those
former plain direct words be not Matrimonial, certainly these later indirect
and obscure words are not Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part. c. 4.. 1. n.
6, 7, 8. etc.
. But concerning this second Question, namely, Whether these words [habebo te
in uxorem, I will have thee to my Wife] import Matrimony? I shall not need to
discuss, having already uttered my full mind therein: Wherefore it shall be
more requisite to return to the former Question, and examine what is the true
sense of these words [non habebo aliam, etc.] And whether they induce Matrimony
or Spousals, or neither? for there be diverse Opinions herein.

24. The first Opinion is, (as I said) That these words [Non habebo aliam in
uxorem nisi te, I will not have any other to my Wife except thee] are
equivalent and all one in effect to these words [habebo te in uxorem, I will
have thee to my Wife Panor. and Praepos. post Jo. And. in c. ex part. de

iste nu. 89. and Menoch. Tract. de praesump. lib. 3. praesump. 3. n. 8.
], which words, if the received Sentence be true, induce Matrimony Praeall. c.
ex part, de Sponsal. extra. and communiter DD. in c. ex literis. el. 1. eod.
August. Berous q. 6. Vivius and Soarez. Thesaur. com. op verb. Matrimonium.
. The Reason of this Opinion does chiefly rely upon this adversative [nisi,
except] for such is the efficacy or operation thereof, that it does still put
the Contrary to that which goes before it L. Action C. de transact. and. ibi
DD. Spiegel. Lexic. verb. [nisi].
: As if the Sentence going before be an Affirmative, that which follows is
Negative L. 1.. Idem Neratius. ff. deposit. Rebuff. in L. verum de Verb. Sig.
ff.
; or if the Sentence going before be Negative that which follows is
Affirmative c. peccatum. de Reg. Jur. in Sext. Bar. and aalii. in l. cum. qui
injuriarum ff. si quis caution. and in d. L. Actionem. C. de transact.
. For Example; say a Man writes thus in his Testament [ I give and bequeath
unto thee all my Books except the Code L. nam quod liquide.. ultim. de ff. de
pen. Legate.
], or contrariwise [ I do not give or bequeath unto thee any of my Books,
except the Code Alciat. in L. Action. C. de transact. n. 25.
]; In the former Instance this word [nisi] following an Affirmative
Proposition, stands Negatively; as though the Testator had said [ My Code I
do not bequeath unto thee d. L. nam quod.. ultim. de pen. Leg DD. l. 1. de Reg.
Jur. ff.
]. In the second Instance, this word (but) following a Negative Proposition
stands Affirmatively; as if the Testator had said [ I do bequeath my Code
unto thee Alciat. in d. L. Actionem n. 25. Licet (inquit) alii absque ratione
diffentiant, ut Bald. in c. cum olim nobis. de elect. extra. n. 1. Tu vide Jas.
in L. 2. C. de bonorum poss.
]. And so in our Case, whereas any Man says thus [I will not have any other to
my Wife except thee], here this word (except) following a Negative Proposition,
does import an Affirmative; and so is in effect as if he had plainly said [I
will have thee to my Wife Sichard. in d. L. Action and communiter Canonistae
in c. ex part de Sponsal. extra.
].

25. The second Opinion is, That by words above recited, Spousals only, and not
Matrimony, is contracted Anto. de Butr. Called. and Zochus in c. ex part. de
Spons. extra. Alciat. in L. Actionern. C. de transact. n. 28
: The Reason of which Opinion is this, namely, Because by the Civil Law, if a
Man Covenant with thee not to sell his House to any other except to thee L. fi
sterilis.. si fundum. ff. de action. Emp. and vend. nec refert quod
Jurisconsultus utatur dictione [quam] nos vero loquamur de dictione [nisi,] Cum

alii quam tibi] adnotante Laur. Vall. lib. 3. elegan. c. 54. and Covar. Tract.
de Spons. secunda part, c. 4.. 1. n. 18.
; albeit he ought not to sell his House unto any but unto thy self; yet neither
is he to be compelled precisely thereunto Jas. in L. si eum. qui injuriarum.
ff. si quis Caution. n. 37. Zas. in L. qui Romae.. cohaeredes ff. de verb. ob.
n. 3.
, except in certain Cases De quibus Jas. ubi supra. post. Bar. in d. L. eum.

; neither if he do sell it to any other, contrary to his Covenant, is the Sale
therefore void L. Stipulationes non dividuntur. versic. Celsus. ff. de verb.
oblig. Cagnel. in L. 2. C. de pact. inter Emp. ex vend. n. 12. ubi distinguit
inter pactum de retro vendende, and pactum de restituendo.
, though otherwise he be answerable unto thee for so much as thou had
interest, not to have been deceived thereby Carol. Molin. in rep. L. unic. c.
de eo quod interest. n. 46. d. L. Stipulationes. versic. Celsus. and ibi DD.
Jas. in L. si eum injuriarum ff. si quis Caution. n. 41.
: And so (to apply our Case to his) whereas the Man says to the Woman [I will
have none other to my Wife except thee], albeit he ought not to take another
Wife, yet is he rather to be monished than compelled to marry this Woman c.
requisivit. de Sponsal. extra.
; and if he do indeed marry another Woman, contrary to his Promise, this
Marriage (according to this Opinion) is not to be dissolved Anto. de Butr. and
Zochus in d. c. ex part.
, howsoever otherwise the Man be punishable propter laesionem fidei c. 1. de
poenis. lib. 5. Provincial. constitut. Cant.
for breach of his Promise Siquidem laeditur fides, violato promisso, etiamsi
nullum intervenisset Juramentum. Lindwood. in d. c. 1. de poenis. verb. fidei
transgress.
: And this Opinion (even by the Confession of those which hold the contrary)
does seem very reasonable Summa Rosel. verb. Matrimonium. q. 3.
. As for the fundamental Reason wherein the former Opinion is wholly rooted, it
is thus answered: Admit the efficacy of the word [nisi] be such, that following
a Negative it does obtain the force of an Affirmative, yet this affirmation is
not of a present Act, but of a future Ability or Possibility Anto. de Butr. in
d. c. ex part. and ibi Praepos. n. 7. Henr-Boic in c. de quarta. de
praescript. extra.
; for confirmation whereof, the Authors of this second Opinion do usually
allege two notable places, the one borrowed out of the Civil, the other out of
the Canon Law: That of the Civil Law is this; One making his Testament, and
disposing about the Liberty of his Bondsman Onesiphorus, says thus [Onesiphore,
liber ne esto, nisi rations excusseris L. Titia.. fin. de manumiss. Testam.
ff. and ibi. gloss.
, Onesiphorus, be not thou free, except thou dispatch thine Accounts;] The
Accounts being dispatched, yet is not the Servant thereby set at Liberty Immo
potius audiri quam dari libertatem ex verbis quae proponuntur respondet. J. C.
in d.. ultim.
, but in possibility only to be made Free (in case the Heir will), whereas
otherwise it was impossible for him to obtain a Freedom, the Testator having
prohibited the same, except he made his Accounts Bar. in d.. ultim. L. Titia.
de manumiss. Testa. ff. Alciat. in L. action. C. de transact. n. 33. Peckius
in c. peckius in c. peccatum de Reg. Jur. in Sext. verb. [nisi] Molin. in
addit. ad Dec. in d. L. action.
. The place of the Canon Law is extant amongst the Rules thereof, where it is
thus written, Peccatum non dimittitur, nisi restituatur ablatum c. peccatum. de
Reg. Jur. in Sext.
; the Sin is not remitted, unless the thing wrongfully taken be restored. Now
the thing unlawfully taken being restored, yet is not the Crime presently
remitted Phil. Franc. and Peckius in d. c. peccatum.
, for there be diverse other things over and besides Restitution, necessary to
the obtaining Remission Phil. Franc. and Peckius ubi supra. Alciat. in L.
action C. d. transact. n. 33.
; so that by Restitution only, that impossibility is cut off, which otherwise
did hinder the Remission Alciat. in d. L. Actionem. and Peckius in d. c.
peccatum n. 4. and ibidem Franc.
of the Offense; and that which before was denied to be possible, as the Case
then stood, is now affirmed for possible, the Case being altered, and the
Exception completed Alciat. Franc. and Peckius ubi supra.
: Wherefore it appears by those two Authorities, That albeit the word [nist]
following a Negative Sentence, have the force of an Affirmative, yet this
affirmation is not of the Act it self, but of the possibility thereof Vide
Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 4. 1. n. 6.
. Howbeit, if we will take the pains to view these two last Examples with a
diligent Eye, and confer them with our Case, we shall clearly perceive that
they vary not a little from this; for in these two Cases (besides other
differences Vide DD. in c. Action. C. de Transact.
), the Exception is governed by another Verb, and so the Sentence is made
Conditional Jaf. in L. si eum. qui injuriarum ff. si quis Caution. n. 26.
Alciat. in l. action. C. de transact. Henr. Boic. in c. quarta de praescript.
extra. Covar. ubi supra.
, whereas in our Case the Exception is governed by the same Verb, and so the
Sentence remains simple Alciat. in Praeal. l. action. and Jas. ac alii in
d.. qui injuriarum. and in d. L. action.
; and therefore we are not to be removed from the former Opinion by these
Examples, so far distant, and so apparently different from this Case of ours Ex
seperatis non refertur L. ultim. ff. de Calum. L. Papinianus de minor. ff. and
ibi Bart.
. If you will not suffer me thus to pass, but pull me back again to the
Consideration of the first Reason and Ground of this second Opinion, and tell,
that though you Covenant with me not to sell your House to any other, except to
me; In this Case the Exception is governed by one and the same Verb Alciat. in
L. action C. de transact. n. 24.29. Bar. in l. si eum. qui injuriarum ff. si
quis Cautionib. n. 9. and ibi Jas. n. 26.
, and yet nevertheless the House is not hereby perfectly bought and sold Angel.
in L. qui Rom.. cohaeredes. de verb. oblig. ff. and ibi Zasius n. 3. Jas. in L.
fi eum.. qui injuriarum. si quis caution. ff. n. 37, 41. Molin. in rep. L.
unic. de eo quod interest. C. n. 46.
, and so infer. That when as the Man says [I will have none other to my Wife
except thee] and she likewise [I will have none other to my Husband except
thee], this is no more a perfect Contract of Matrimony, than that a perfect and
absolute Sale of the House. I deny the Argument: For admit a Man do Covenant by
direct words, that he will sell his House to me for such a price; and I again
do Covenant and Promise, that I will buy the same House for the same price; by
this Covenant the House is not yet absolutely bought and sold Covar. Tract. de
Sponsal. secunda part, c. 4. l. n. 6. verb. Sed ille. Text. gloss. in L.
vendentis C. de contrahend. Empt. DD. in L. Servi electione ff. de leg. 1. and
supra.
: But if a Man say to a Woman [I will have thee to my Wife], and she to him [I
will have thee to my Husband], this is a perfect Contract of indissoluble
Matrimony c. ex part de Sponsal. extra. and ibi Panor and caeteri Canonist.
Menoch. de praesump. Lib. 3. praesump. 3.
, as has been already proved supra. eod.. 11.
. Wherefore since it is apparent that diverse words are sufficient to prove a
perfect Contract of Matrimony, which will not suffice for a perfect Sale gloss.
in L. In vendentis. C. de contrahend. Emp. Jas. Alciat. and alii DD. in L.
Servi electione. ff. de leg. 1.
, it follows, That if any do reason after this manner, these words suffice
not to make the Sale perfect, Ergo they are not sufficient to make the Contract
perfect Vide Covar. d. c. 4.. 1. n. 6. and vide supra hoc ipso. 11.
, this Argument is not sound. Thus we see that this second Opinion, how weighty
soever it seem at the first lift, yet being equally balanced with the former,
it is found to be the lighter, whether we respect the Credit of the Authors of
either Opinion, or ponder the Gravity of their Reasons.

26. The third Opinion is, That these words [ Non habebo aliam in uxorem nisi
te, etc.] induce neither Matrimony nor Spousals Didac. Covar. Tract. de
Sponsal. secunda part, c. 4.. 1. n. 7. and 8. Idem asserit Palud. in 4.
distinct. 27. q. 1. Artic. 1. col. 2.
, and that for two Causes. The first is, Because the words are mere Negative,
at least, the Authors of this Opinion contend sharply that they be so Covar.
and Palud. ubi supra.
, and therefore induce neither Matrimony nor Spousals Covar. and Palud. ubi
supra. vide Bald. in L. action C. de transact. op. prima. and vide L. december.
de verb. ob. and L. Julianus de repudiis ff. and ibi Bart. and DD.
. The Argument is very strong; for if the Sentence be wholly Negative, it does
not affirm any thing, and if it affirm nothing, then does it not affirm either
Matrimony or Spousals Unde Versiculus [Syllogizari non est ex particulari.
Neque negativis recte concludere sivis.]
; nor is the Antecedent very weak, if the Case were to be examined and
discussed by the only Precepts and strict Rules of Logic Covar. ubi supra.
Attamen Perierius non dubitat affirmare, quod omnes etiam dialectaci haec verba
[non habebo aliam nisi te] sic exponunt [Habebo te and non aliam] Verb.
Matrimonium 2. n. 10.
; for if Caesar (that I may use their own Example) do promise that he will not
fight this year, except against the Turk, he does not hereby Promise, that he
will fight this year against the Turk Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part,
c. 4.. 1. n. 7.
; nor can this Collection be justly defended for Infallible: No Man disputes
except Socrates, Ergo, Socrates disputes only Covar. d. 1. n. 8. verb. nec
valet, etc.
; it being first supposed that some Man does dispute, which being a matter in
Fact, is not to be presumed L. In. bello.. facti ff. de captiv. Lemancipati C.
de Colla.
. Marry, this thing being presupposed that some Man does dispute, if then none
else but Socrates does dispute, it must needs follow then that Socrates
disputes Covar. d.. 1. n. 8. in fin.
; even so whiles any Man says, That he will have no Wife, except thee; it does
not follow therefore he will have thee, unless he had first promimised to have
some Woman to his Wife Covar. ubi supra. and Hadrian. in 4. quest. 12. de
matrim.
. The other Cause of this third Opinion proceeds from the Contemplation of
the Etymology, or proper Signification of this word [nisi] the which is
engendered or compounded of [non] and [ si Jas. in L. si eum. qui injuriarum ff.
si quis Caution. n. 32. Alciat. in l. action c. d. transact. n. 24. Dictionar.
Cooperi. verb. [Nisi] and Calepin. Cornucop. verb. [nisi] Addic. ad Laur. Vall.
lib. 2. elegan. c. 19.
] and does properly signify [ si non, if not gloss. in l. Sancinius C. de
donat. Calepin. and Cooperus ubi supra.
], and so these words [non habebo aliam in uxorem nisi te, I will not have any
other to my Wife but thee] are thus to be understood, [non habebo aliam in
uxorem si non te, I will not have any other to my Wife, if not thee], which
being true, the true Sense and Meaning is no other in Substance, than if the
Party had said, If hereafter I shall resolve to lead my life in Wedlock, of
which thing I am not yet resolved, I do here promise thee, that when I am so
resolved, I will have thee to my Wife, and not any other Woman Hunc esse illius
oratienis sensum acriter contendit. Covar. in. d. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda

Sponsal. n. 3.
. By which Promise, neither Matrimony, neither yet Spousals, are contracted, at
least simply or absolutely; Therefore if the Party resolve never to Marry, but
lead a single Life until his Death, neither is he to be urged to the contrary,
neither can he be touched with the Breach of his Promise in this Case Covar.
ubi supra. and Specul. in d. Rub. de Sponsal. verb. possibile. lib. 2. cons.

. To return to the former Cause, where it is constantly affirmed, that the
words be mere Negative Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 4.. 1. n. 7.
. Surely howsoever this Assertion might peradventure (in regard of the Rules
and Traditions of Dialectical Discipline) procure sundry Favorers in Schools
and Places of Disputation, where singular and strange opinions are very
plausible and acceptable, especially to such as have a good Conceit of their
own Wit and Learning Audi quaeso Corasrum in Praefat. Tract. de communi op. sic

maledics dentibus nunquam desinunt lacerare, inde naseitur proverbium. Communis
opinio. ergo falsa, etc.
; Yet in regard of the meaning and intent of the speaker Quaemeus vel praecipue
attendenda est in hac re. Bald. in l. Actionem C. de transact. n. 2.
, and in respect of the favor of Matrimony (k), it would find but few Patrons
in Consistories and places of Judgment; Siquidem consulendo and judicando non
licet a communi opinione recedere, Aiunt Hostiens. Jo. And. Auto. de Butr. and
Panor. in c. 1. de Constitut.

as well Civilians, as Canonists, do generally defend the Contrary Jo. And. Abb.

praesump. lib. 3. praesump. 3. lib. 1. consil. matr. fol. 119. n. 1.
; Indeed if the Party had said no more but this (I will not have any other to
my Wife], in this Case I will not deny the Sentence to be negative; And if any
Man say thus [there is none good], or thus [no Man may put away his Wife];
These (I confess) be mere Negative Propositions: But if he do not stay here,
but shall add an Exception to these Negatives, and say, [ there is none good
but God Marc. c. 10. verse. 18. and Luc. c. 18. verse. 19.
], or] no Man may put away his Wife except for Fornication Matthew. c. 19. 1
Epist. ad Corinth. c. 7.
], what else (in good sooth) is this but to affirm that God is good; and that a
Man may put away his Wife for Fornication? So in our Case, when as the Party
after he has said [I will not have any other to my Wife] does not there stay,
but does add an exception to this Negative, saying (I will not have any other
to my Wife except thee] this exception following a Negative Proposition, has
the force of an Affirmative Jas. and Sichard. in. L. action C. de transact.
Panor. and Praepos. in c. ex part, de Sponsal. extra.
; And so (if we be not disposed to Frowardness) it is in effect, as if the
Party had said [I will have thee to my Wife and no other Summa Silvestrin.
verb. Matrimon. 2. n. 10.
. Yea, but all this is not sufficient to satisfy the untoward minds of some
Persons, that are ready to reply, That although it be so, that he which
speaks thus [none is good but God], does affirm that God is good, and that he
which says [no Man may put away his Wife except for Fornication] does affirm
that for Fornication a Man may put away his Wife. This is true say they, non ex
propria vi dictionis [nisi], Sed ex materia Subjecta and natura rei Vide Covar
Tract. de Spon. sal. secunda. part, c. 4.. 1. n. 8. ubi alia invenies exempla
nostris non dissimilia, sed magis ignota Nostratibus.
, not by the proper force of this word [ but, or except], but by reason of the
subjected Matter, and nature of the thing. For it is necessarily supposed, ex
natura rei, that some is good; for if none were good, the Devil (being wholly
evil) would soon mar all c. visis. 16. q. 2. c. Nec mirum. 26. q. 5. Baldus in
L. 2.. 1. C. de leg.
; Wherefore this being granted, that some is good, Then none being good, but
God, it follows concludently, That God is good The like may be said
concerning Divorce, where it is presupposed ex Subjecta Materia, that for some
Cause the Husband may put away his Wife; seeing then, not for any Cause, except
for Fornication, the Collection is true, Ergo for Fornication she may be put
away Id quod ipse Covar. ingenue fatctur, licet alijs exemplis, sed non tam
familiaribus utatur, in d.. 1 n. 8.
. But in our Case (say they) neither the nature of the thing, neither the
Subjected Matter does enforce any necessity of this presumption, viz. That he
which says [I will not have any other to my Wife, except thee] did intend that
he would have some Woman to his Wife Covai. d.. 1. n. 9.
, because it may be that the Man in so saying, did mean neither to Marry her,
nor any other Covarubi supra and Palud. in 4. distinct. 27. q. 1. ar. 1. col.
2. Molin. in addit. ad Dec. in c. Juravit. de probat. extra.
; and therefore there is not the like Consequence in this Case, as in those
Cases. To this Objection thus; Who doubts, but it may be, that he which says
[I will have thee to my Wife], does never mean to have her Quo casu judicatur
pro Matrimonio, in foro judiciali, secus in poenitentiali c. tua nos. de
Sponsal. extra.
; for some Men can say one thing, and think the contrary d. c. Tua and ibi DD.
. And so it may be that he which says [I will not have any other to my Wife,
except thee], does no more mean to have her to his Wife than any other; but
this is very unlikely Scil. ob Causas inferius descriptas.
: Seeing then by all reasoinable Constuction the Contrary is more probable, I
answer as does that excellent Lawyer, who (for his manifold Distinctions fit
and ready at every need) can never be sufficiently commended, namely Baldus,
writing after this manner, Opponitur quod dictio [nisi] nil ponit, etiamsi
negatio praecedat. Solutio, Si men's loquentis patitur tunc point; si men's
loquentis non patitur, tunc non ponit in L. Action c. de transaction. n. 2.
. Its Objected (faith Baldus) that this word [nisi, but, or except] does affirm
nothing, although a Negative go before. The Solution is this, if the meaning of
him that speaks does suffer, it affirms, if his meaning do not suffer, it
does not affirm. Now in our case his meaning does not only suffer this
affirmation, but can hardly abide the Contrary: Also sundry inconveniences and
absurdities would ensue Ut autem evitetur absurdum, and men's loquentis servetur
usque adeo permissa est interpretatio, ut vel a proprietate verborum recedere
licet L. nam absurdum ff. de bon liber. Baldus in L. Pomponius ff. de nego.
gest.
; for if his meaning were simply not to have any Wife at all (as is objected)
To what end (I pray you) did he say [I will have no other]? But especially
wherefore did he make any Exception, after he had said [I will not have any
other to my Wife]? Verily this Exception expressed in these words [except thee]
had been wholly Superfluous Superfluitatis vitium quam diligentissime fugtend.

, in so weighty a Cause, or the meaning deceitful c. Tua nos, and ibi Panor. de

, in so favorable a Matter, it is probably, justly, and charitably collected,
That the true sense and meaning of these words [I will not have any other to my

Wife and no other Immo non solum Juristae, sed and omnes dialectici ita
exponunt hujusmodi verba, inquit Silvester. Prier. verb. Matrimonium 2. n. 10.
]; and consequently the Sentence is not mere Negative. Well, now let us try
whether the other Cause of this third Opinion be worthy of such an Effect. It
is said that this word [nisi] being formed of [ si and non Alciat. in l.
action C. de transac. n. 24. Jas. in L. Si eum.. qui injuriarum. ff. Si quis
caution. n. 32. Gloss. in l. Sancimus C. de Donat. Calepin. Cornucop. verb.
[nisi].
], does properly signify [ si non (l), if not]; and therefore the sense of the
former words, [I will not have any other to my Wife, except thee], is no more
in effect, than if the Party had said [ If I have not thee to my Wife I will
never have any other Covar. tract. de Spon. sal. 2. part c. 4.. 1. Add Molin.
in addit. ad Dec. in c. juravit. de probat. extra.
], which words induce not Matrimony nor Spousals, etc. Covar. ubi supra. lib.
2. consil. matr. consil. ibidem. 5. Spec. in Rub. de Sponsal. extra. verb.
possibile.
Whereunto briefly this is the Answer; This word [nisi] is sometimes placed in
the beginning of a Sentence, and sometimes it follows a Sentence Bar. Jas.
and alii in L. Si eum. qui injuriarum ff. Si quis Caution.
; when it is placed in the beginning of a Sentence, then does it signify [ Si
non Bart. in d.. qui injuriarum. n. 9. and ibi Jas. n. 26. verb. subit Sunt
tamen qui distinctionem hanc reprehendunt, ut per Alex. in. d.. n. 9. and Jas.
ubi supra. Quinimo and ipse Bart. sibi non constat, Sentiens dispositionem
semper praecedere, attento rei intellect. in l. 1. ff. de Cond. Demon. Sed nos
verborum ordinem respicimus.
, if not]; and so makes the Proposition conditional L. Obligationum. Conditio
de action. and oblig. Bar. in d. L. Si eum. qui Injuriarum. ff. Si quis
Caution. n. 9.
. As for example, if any say [ nisi venero, dabo tibi december libras Nisi quoties
principium Sententiae est, judicativum desiderat, ait Laur. Vall. lib. 2.
Elegan. sed apud. Bar. Nisi in principio orationis collocatum, subjunctive
jungitur, eo quod nec ut rationale nec ut casuale, sed ut conditionale habetur.
i.e. si non venero, except I come I will give thee ten pounds]; That is to
say, [if I do not come], or as the Psalmist says [ nisi Dominus custodierit
Civitatem frustra vigilant Custodes Psalm. 127. ubi translator. quia nisi
conditionaliter accipitur, licet in principio subjunctivum annectit.
, i.e. Si non custodierit, etc. Except the Lord keep the City, in vain do the
Keepers watch, that is to say [if the Lord do not keep, etc.]: When it
follows a Sentence, then we are to consider, whether it be joined to another
Verb or not Bar. in L. Si eum. qui injuriarum ff. Si quis Caution. n. 8.
; if it be joined to another Verb, then it does also enjoy the Signification of
[Si non, if not], as in the former Example, whereby the Proposition is made
Conditional Bar. in d.. qui injuriarum n. 8. verb. si vero. per. l. fidei
commissi. si fidei Commissum ff. de leg. 3. and L. 1. and 2. de In diem addi.
, [ non dimittitur peccatum nisi restituatur ablatum C. peccatum de reg. jur.
in Sext.
, i. e. Si non restituatur, the Sin is not remitted, except the thing taken be
not restored, that is to say, if it be not restored, etc.]: But if it be not
joined to another Verb, but is ruled by the Verb aforegoing, Then by the
Opinion of the best and most Authors, it does not enjoy the Signification of
[Si non, if not,] nor makes the Proposition conditional, but stands
adversatively, establishing the Contrary, to that which went before it Bart.
ubi supra. and in l. action. C. de transac. and ibi Bald. Alex. Jas. Dec. and
A ciat.
; So that if the Proposition aforegoing were affirmative, the Exception is
negative; Or if the Proposition were negative, the exception is affirmative DD.
in de L. action.
, as has been heretofore confirmed. Now in our Case the word [nisi, except] is
not placed in the beginning of the Sentence, neither is it joined to another
Verb, but depends of the former; and therefore it does not enjoy the
signification of [Si non, if not) as is pretended, but rather of this word [
praeter, or praeterquam, besides, or but] implying the Contrary to that which
went before L. nam quod Liquide ff. de pen. Leg.. pen. Bar. in L. Si eum. qui
injuriarum. Si quis Caution. ff. n. 6, and 7. and ibi Jas. n. 35. DD. in l. 1.
ff. de pig. action. DD. in l. action C. de transac.
; especially in favorable Causes Secus in Materia odiosa. Jas. in d.. qui
injuriarium n. 36. gloss. in clem. 1. de usuri. in verb. facere. Bald. in L.
Seco.. uxor ff. de Ann. Leg.
. Thus we may behold the weakness of this second Cause, and how unworthy it is
of that Effect, which notwithstanding it has wrought in some Men's minds.

27. The fourth Opinion is. That if the words be Conceived after this manner,
[I will not have any to my Wife, except thee]; In this case Spousals are
contracted Hardian. in 4. q. 12. de matrim. Cujus meminit Covar. in Tract. de
Spon sal. 2. parre c. 4.. 1. nu. 6. versus fin.
: But if the words be conceived in this form [I will not have any other Woman
to my Wife, except thee], in this Case neither Matrimony nor Spousals is
contracted Hadr. and Covar. ubi supra.
; The reason of which Opinion I cannot easily reach unto; and for ought I
understand this is a distinction without a difference, that is to say, a little
variation in words, but in sense none at all; which words also (me thinks) be
more pregnant in the later Case, where notwithstanding they are condemned for
barren and fruitless. For while the Man says [ I will not have any other, etc.
de notura hujus dictionis (alius) vide Bald in L. Convent culam C. de Eipis.
and Cler. and in L. si fugitivi C. de servis fugi.
] it should seem that by excluding others he does include her to whom he
speaks Specul. in Rub. de Sponsal. and matr. extra. n. 3. quamvis ex hoc
solo, quod vir mulieri dicat [non habebo aliam in uxorem] non opinor induci
Matrimonium nisi etiam addiderit [nisi te.] Spec. in. d. Rub. n. 4. Summa
Angelic. verb. matr. 2. n. 12. in fin.
: Whereas in the former Case there is not the like Emphasis, for defect of like
words, although as well in the one, as in the other, the words be sufficient to
induce Matrimony, because of these words (except thee) uttered in both Cases,
the which words following a negative, have the force of an affirmative (as I
have often foretold) and so are as if he had said plainly [ I will have thee to
my Wife Panor. and Praepos. in c. ex part. de Sponsal. extra. DD. in L.
action C. de transac.
].

28. Fifthly, by the Opinion of most who labor in the defense of the second
Opinion above delivered, If the words of the Contract be formed in the Present
Tense, as [ Nolo habere aliam in Vxorem, nisi te, I will, or I will not (now)
have any other to my Wife, except thee] they induce present Matrimony Specul.
in Rub. de Sponsal. extra. n. 5. Auto. de Butr. in c. ex part. de Sponsal
extra. Jo. Brun. in tract. de Sponsal. concl. 13. Jas. in L. action C. de
transac. n. 4.
: But if the words be framed in the Future Tense, as [ Non habebo aliam in
Vxorem, nisi te, I will not (viz. hereafter.) have any other to my Wife, except
thee] hereby Spousals de futuro, and not Matrimony, are induced Anto de Butr.
in d. c. ex part. Alciat. in L. action C. de transac. n. 28. and Molin. in
addit. ad Dec. in eund. L.
; except in certain Cases, As when the Parties did before entreat of Matrimony
to be contracted betwixt them Specul. in Rub. de Sponsal. n. 3. verb. secus
antem Caepol. consil. 1. col. pen. in civilibus dec. in L. action C. de
transac. n. 7. Pacianus Tract. de probac. Lib. 1. c. 35. n. 66. verse. mihi.
; or where a Ring was given and received in manner as is accustomed at the
contracting of Matrimony Menoch. Tract. de praesump. lib. 3. praesump. 3. n. 8.
Caepol. d. consil. 1.
, or in such like Case Nempe quibus verba quae alias inspecta sua natura non
nisi Sponsalia denotant, adhibitis quibusdam Circumstantijs inducunt
Matrimonium, id quod non raro contangit, ut pronime tradidimus in superioribus
Paragraphis.
. The Reason whereby diverse have been drawn into this Opinion, and persuaded
that the words of the Contract, being framed in the Present Tense, Matrimony;
and being framed in the Future Tense, Spousals only are induced, is this; The
word [nisi] say they, following a Negative Proposition, although it have the
force of an Affirmative (for thus much they willingly confess with us Anto de
Butr. in d.c. ex part. de Sponsal. extra. Coepol. d. consil. 1. col. pen.
Alciat. in d. l. action. n. 25.
,) yet does it not affirm any more than is before denied in the Proposition
before going; so that if in the former part of the Sentence a present Act be
denied, in the Exception following a present Act is affirmed: But if in the
former part of the Sentence a future disposition or ability be denied, in the
Excepton following no more is affirmed, than future disposition or ability
Anto. de Butr. Coepol. and Alciat. ubi supra.
. And here I confess with them that they say truly Bar. in L. Si eum. qui
injuriarum. ff. Si quis Caution. n. 4. verb. sed advertend. and ibi Bald. col.
pen. verb. respondit. and Alex. n. 8. nec contradicit Panor. in d. c. ex part.
de Spons. extra. n. 8. vel Praepos. eod.c.n. 7.
, since the Exception is of the nature of the Rule Dec. Cagnol. and Hieron.
Franc. in l. 1. de Reg. Jur. ff.
: This then being confessed on both sides, namely, That the Exception does
affirm no more than the Proposition does deny; they proceed and say, That by
words of the Present Tense a present Act, and by words of the Future Tense a
future Disposition or Ability only, is denied in the Negative Proposition, and
consequently affirmed in the Exception following Specul. in Rub. de Sponsal.
extra. Anto. de Butr. in d. c. ex part de Spons. extra. Coepol. d. consil. 1.
Add Prier. verb. Matrimonium 2. q. 10.
. But here we do not altogether agree in every point; for though this may be
safely yielded unto them, that the words of the Contract being conceived in the
Present Tense, as [ Nolo habere aliam in Vxorem, nisi te, I will not (now) have
any, except thee] a present Act is here denied in the Proposition, and so a
present Act affirmed in the Exception Praepos. in d. c. ex part n. 8. Bar.
Bald. and Alex. in L. Si eum. qui injuriarum ff. Si quis caution. Silvest.
Prier. verb. matrimonium. 2. q. 10.
; yet when as they challenge further, That the words of the Contract being
framed in the Future Tense, a future Disposition or Ability only is understood,
This is not to be yielded unto them for sound or certain; since it is sure,
that diverse words (whereof [habebo] I will have, is one) which albeit they be
formed in the Future Tense, yet nevertheless have the force of the Present
Tense Supra hoc ipso. in princ. DD. in c. ex literis el. 1. and in c. ex part
de Sponsal. extra.
; and though [non habebo] signify [I will not have hereafter], yet this
[hereafter] is not a Year hence, nor a Month, nor a Seven-night, nor a Day, nor
an Hour hence, but immediately and presently after the speaking of the words,
without any distance or intermission ubi enim nullum apponitur tempus, statim
debetur. Panor. in d. c. ex part n. 8. in fin.. ult. Institut. deinutil.
Stipula. L. cedere diem ff. de verb. signif. and ibi DD.
at all; like as if the Party had said [from henceforth, I will not have any
other to my Wife, except thee]; and therefore since the Exception affirms no
less than was before denied Bar. and alij in L. actionem. C. de transac. Dec.
and Cagnol. in l. 1. de Reg. Jur. ff.
; It follows, That by the former words thus much is affirmed, at least in
effect, though not in sound, [from henceforth I will have thee for my Wife],
which words verily induce Matrimony, not Spousals c. ex part de Sponsal. extra.
; and so it is not material whether a Man say [nolo habere, I will not have] in
the Present Tense, or [non habebo], in the Future Tense. And if there were any
difference, yet our Language considered, these words [I will or I will not] are
no more proper to the Future Tense, than to the Present Siquidem [volo habere
and habebo] (attento nostratis linguae idiomate) eisdem prorsus verbis
exponuntur, [I will have] Silicet [nolo habere and non habebo, I will not have]
sine ullo temporis discrimine.
; and therefore being indifferent, ought rather to be referred to the Present
Tense, in favor of Matrimony Menoch. de praesump. lib. 3. praesump. 3. in fin.
Lapus Alleg. 56. Praepos. in: d. c. ex part. n. 7. in fin.
.

29. Thus having surveyed the sundry Opinions and conceits concerning these
words [non habebo aliam in Vxorem, nisi te, I will not have any other to my
Wife, except thee] I rest and stay with the received Opinion Hanc. enim. op.
communem esse refert. Praepos. in c. ex part de Spons. extra quod etiam
fatetur Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. 2. part. c. 4.. 1. n. 6. and Menoch. Tract.
de praesump. lib. 3. praesump. 3. n. 8.
; Concluding, that they import thus much, [I will have thee to my Wife]; which
Conclusion also (as I take it) has place, when as the Parties instead of the
word [nisi, except] do use some other exceptive words, as [praeter, quam,
praeterquam de quibus dictionibus Bar. Jas. and Alex. in L. Si eum. qui
injuriarum. ff. Si quis caution. and generaliter DD. in L. action C. de
transac.
, besides, than, but], saying for Example, [ I will have none other to my Wife,
except thee, or than thee, or but thee]; for hereby also is signified [ I will
have thee to my Wife Saltem attento communi loquendi usu, cui omnino standum
est, postposita verborum proprietate. Praepos. in d. c. ex part de Spons.
extra. n. 7. per. c. ex literis el. 1. eod. Tit.
]: Which words being mutually uttered by either party, induce Matrimony Panor.
in c. ex literis el. 1. de Spons. extra. and ibi. Praepos. and alij and in c.
ex part eod.
.

30. Now at last let us give place to the Limitations of the former Rule, which
says, That when the Parties do Contract themselves by words of the present
time, or by words of the future time, having relation to the Execution or
Substance of Matrimony, Spousals de praefenti (being in substance Matrimony)
are thereby contracted; of which Rule, these be the Limitations which do now
approach, marching one after another.

31. The first Limitation is when Children are Contracted together by words of
present time; for albeit they say thus, [I take thee to my Wife, and I take
thee to my Husband]; This by Interpretation of Law is not Matrimony, but
Spousals c. unic.. 1. de despons. impub. lib. 6.
; Albeit, also they did thereby intend to contract Matrimony d.. 1. cum Gloss.
ibidem. contra antiquam quorund. opinionem, de quibus Henr. Boic. in c. a nobis
de despons. impub. extra. and Hostiens. Summa Tit. de despons. impub.. and quae
Sponsalia.
. By [Children] here I understand them which have past their Infancy, but have
not as yet attained to lawful years for Marriage vide supra.. 7.
; for during Infancy neither Matrimony nor Spousals can be contracted c. 1. de
despons. impub. in Sext. L. In sponsal. el. 2. ff. de Sponsal.
.

32. The second Limitation is when the one Party is of full Age, and the other
a Child, which are contracted together by words of the present time, for this
Contract is not Matrimony, but only Spousals de futuro as if they were both
Children d. c. unic.. 1. de despons. impub. in Sext. and supra. 6.
.

33. The third Limitation is, when these words of the present time are uttered
in Jest or Sport, for such wanton words are not at all obligatory in so
serious a matter as is Matrimony Jo. And. in c. fin. de despons. impub.
Repertorium Nic. Milis verb. Matrimonium L. Obligationis substantia ff. de
action. and oblig. and l. illud ff. de jure jur. alleganti tamen Jocum incumbit
probatio, aliter non praesumitur, sed in dubio pro Matrimonio judicabitur, Lib.
2. consil. matrimonial. consil. ibidem 34. n. 11.
.

34. The fourth Limitation is, when the words be mere negative: As [I will not
have any other Woman to my Wife,] and [I will not have any other Man to my
Husband,] or [I will never forsake thee,] or [ I will never fail thee Covar.
Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 4.. 1. n. 3. in fin. and n. 7. in princ.
Angel. de clavasio. verb. Matrimonium el. 2. n. 12. in fin. Summa Silvestrin.
verb. matrim. 2. q. 13. Summa Rosella. verb. matrim.. 5. versic. quid si dicat.
;] for neither Spousals, neither Matrimony, are hereby induced.

35. The fifth Limitation is, whereas the words be so general and uncertain
that the meaning of the Parties cannot appear: For Example, these words; [ Do
tibi fidem Lib. 1. consil. matrimonial. consil. ibidem 5. n. 8.
, I give thee my Faith,] Nunquam tibi desiciam Silvest. Prior. verb. Matrim. 2.
q. 13.
] I will never fail thee,] Quo animo es? Vis me habere?] What cheer? Will thou
have me lib. 2. consil. matrim. consil. ibidem 5. n. 8.
?] Or thus, [ If ever I marry, I will marry thee lib. 2. consil. matr. consil.
ibidem 14. in princ. and consil. 5. n. 1.
,] with a hundred such like Instances standing afar off, and hanging in
nubibus, which infer neither Matrimony nor Spousals, without special
Circumstances, whereby it may be known, that the Parties did thereby mean and
intend to contract Matrimony or Spousals lib. 1. consil. matr. consil. ibidem
60. n. 16. Henr. Boic. in c. Attestationes. de despons. impub. extra. paulo
ante finem.
.

36. The sixth Limitation (not unlike the former) is, when the Parties do use
these or such like words [ Bibo tibi nomine Matrimonij Praepos. in c. ex part
de Sponsal. extra. n. 8. qui dicit ibi non induci Matrimonium, nisi consuetudo
(inquit) interpretatur, quod [Hoc bibere] inducat Matrimonium.
, I drink to thee in token of Marriage,] and thereupon both of them drink; by
this alone Matrimony is not contracted Vide Praeposaubi supra. and Henr. Boic.
in c. Attestationes. de despons. impub. extra. qui hoc dictum ibidem limitant.
.

37. The seventh Limitation is, when the one Party does promise simply, the
other conditionally: For Example; the Man says [I take thee to my Wife,] the
Woman answers [I take thee to my Husband, if my Father consent;] this is a
void Contract L. 1.. Si quis simpliciter ff. de verb. oblig. Covar. Tract. de
Sponsal. secunda part, c. 3.. 1. n. 11.
, unless the Condition were unpossible or unhonest; for then it is otherwise
DD. in c. fin. de cond. app. extra. and in Anth. si ingressi. de Sanct.
Ecelesiis C.
, as appears in the next Paragraph.

38. The eighth Limitation is, when the one Party does promise under one
Condition, and the other Party under another Condition. For Example; the Man
says, I take thee to my Wife, if my Father consent,] and the Woman says, [ I
take thee to my Husband, if thou will give me 100 l.] Here is neither Matrimony
nor Spousals, but a void Contract Imol. Roman. Zas. and Molin. in l. 1.. fi
quis simpliciter. ff. de verb. oblig.
.

39. The ninth Limitation is, when the one Party does answer with some further
quality or addition impertinent to the Question. As for Example; the Man says,
[Vis esse Vxor mea? Will thou be my Wife?] The Woman answers, [Volo, and
quicquid vis, I will, and whatsoever thou will besides;] for hereby neither
Matrimony nor Spousals is contracted Lib. 1. confil. matrimonial. consil.
ibidem 60. n. 16. post Romans in Rub. de Arbitr.
.

40. The tenth Limitation is, when the words signifying the Essence or
Execution of Marriage, and being conceived in the Future Tense, do follow other
words which naturally or properly import no more but Spousals de futuro; as [ I
will marry thee, and I will hold thee for my Wife Panor. in c. ex part. de
Sponsal. extra. n. 7. in fin. Specul. in Rub. de Sponsal. n. 7. Menoch. de
praesump. lib. 3. praesump. 3. n. 4.
;] for howsoever these words [I will hold thee for my Wife] being uttered alone
induce Matrimony c. ex part. de Sponsal. extra. and ibi Panor. and Praepos.
; yet following other words of another nature, they are deprived of their own
proper virtue, and as Accessory they undergo the nature of the Principal Arg.
L. ultim.. cui dulcia ff. de vino tritic. vel ol. leg. Menoch. de praesump.
lib. 3. praesump. 3. n. 4.
.

41. The eleventh Limitation is, when the Parties do promise that they will
contract Spousals together, for as yet Spousals are not contracted Repertor.
Nic. de Milis. verb. Sponsalia.
: And as he which promises that he will acquit, has not yet acquitted Boer.
decis. 3. in princ. Tiraquel. de Retract. Conventional. ad finem Tituli. n. 52.
fol. (lib. mei) 380.
; so they which promise that they will contract Spousals, have not as yet
contracted, howbeit the Parties are bound in this Case to accomplish their
Promises Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. prima part, c. 4. in princ.
, otherwise they are punishable for not performing the same c. 1. de Spons.
duorum extra. Melchior Kling. Tract. de cause. matrimonial. fol. 5.
.

42. The twelfth Limitation is, when the Promise is not mutual: For Example;
the Man says to the Woman [I take thee to my Wife,] but the Woman does not
make the like Promise to the Man; or contrariwise, she does promise Matrimony,
but not he: This being a lame or halting Contract, is not of any force Praepos.
in c. 1. de Spons. duorum extra. lib. 1. consil. matr. consil. ibidem 84. n. 4.
and lib. 2. consil. 4. n. 1. and consil. 5. n. 1. in fin.
.

43. The thirteenth Limitation is, when there is some lawful impediment,
wherefore the Parties cannot be married together, of the which we shall entreat
hereafter infra.
.

44. The fourteenth Limitation is, when as the Contract being made by words of
the Future time sounding of the Execution of Marriage; as [ I will have thee
for my Wife, and I will have thee for my Husband,] the Parties do afterward
marry elsewhere, consummating the same by Carnal Copulation, for then by the
Opinion of diverse, the second Marriage holds Covar. de Sponsal. secunda
part, c. 4.. 1. n. 5. Molin. in addic. ad Dec. in c. Juravit. de probat. extra.
, unless the words be very pregnant, having some further addition, as [ I will
from henceforth have thee, etc. Marti. in addic. ad Hostiens. Tit. de Sponsal..
quot sunt species.
]

45. Finally, Albeit they which do Contract Spousals de praesenti, be very
Husband and Wife, in respect of the Knot or Bond of Matrimony, so that it is
not lawful for either of them to marry elsewhere, so long as they now live
together c. Conjunx. c. cum Initiatur 27. q. 2. c. si inter de Sponsal. extra.
and ibi DD. Panor. and Felin. in Rub. de Sponsal. extra. Hiero. Schurff. inter

Matrimonial. fol. 7. Schneidwin. Tract. de Nuptiis, fol. 18. n. 4. Covar.
Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 7. in princ.
; yet do not these Spousals produce all the same effects here in England
Perkins Tit. Feoffments, fol. 40.
, which Matrimony solemnized in the face of the Church does, whether we respect
the Legitimation of their Children, or the Property which the Husband has in
the Wife's Goods, or the Dower which she is to have in his Lands Perkins ubi

Verb. Signif. and Covar. Tract. de Sponfal. secunda part, c. 7.. 1. and. 4.
; of which Effects we shall have better opportunity to deliver our mind
hereafter infra cadem part,. 17.
.

SECT. XII. Of the Form or Manner of Contracting Simple and Conditional
Contracts, and those also which be referred to a Day.
1. SEcondly, Spousals be either pure and simple, or referred to a day, or
Conditional. omnis. Institut. de verb. oblig. Lancel. Institut. jur. can. lib.
2. tit. de Sponsal. c. sicut de Sponsal. extra. and ibi Panor. Summa Hostiens.
tit. de condic. oppos. extra.
. Pure and simple Spousals are so called when as the Parties do absolutely
promise Marriage each to other without interposition either of Condition, or
delay of Time Schneidwin. Tract. de Nupt. fol. 26. n. 33. Panor in c. super eo
de cond. appos. de. omnis Institut. de verb. ob. facit L. cedere diem. ff. de
Verb. Signif. and Lancel. ubi supra.
, so that both Obligation and Action is thereupon forthwith engendered and born,
whereby the Parties are immediately bound and linked together, and are also
compellable to solemnize and consummate the promised Matrimony accordingly, at
the instance of either of them Schneidwin. ubi supra. Panor. in d. c. super eo.
Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 3. n. 2.
, unless the Party convented show lawful Cause to the contrary Lancel. Instit.
Jur. Canon. Lib. 2. Tit. de Sponsal. and infra.
.

2. Concerning the Forms of these pure and simple Spousals, and how they are
contracted is particularly described in the two former Paragraphs Supra. 10.
and. 11.
, their sundry effects also do more plainly appear in a more convenient place
Infra. 17.
, and thither I refer thee.

3. Spousals referred to a day are so termed, when as the Parties do refer the
Contract or Marriage to a future time, without mention of any Condition c.
sicut de Sponsal. extra.. omnis Institut. de verb. oblig. L. obligationum.. 1.
de action. and oblig and L. cedere de verb. Sig. ff. and ibi DD.
; For Example, the Man saying to the Woman [ I do promise thee to Marry thee at
Whitsuntide next]; and she answering, and [ I promise to Marry thee then, etc.
DD. in d. c. sicut. Lancel. lib. 2. Institut. jur. Can. Tit. de Sponsal.
]; Concerning these kind of Spousals, two Rules are to be remembered.

4. The first is, that the one Party cannot effectually convent the other for
Marriage, until the time prefixed be expired L. cedere ff. de verb. Sig.. omnis
Institut. de verb. oblig. Hinc est, quod vulgo circumfertur. Anno si debes in
fine teneberis anni, Annua si debes, hinc-inspicitur caput anni.
; Insomuch that if the Parties do covenant to be Married together within a
certain time, as within a Month, or within a Year; Yet until that Month, or
that Year be expired, the one Party cannot effectually convent the other L. qui
hoc anno ff. de verb. Oblig.. pen. Institut. de mutil. Stipul.
, much less when they promise to Marry together after such a time, can any
Action be maintained in the mean time Nam in Stipulatione ex die, Actio interim
non oritur, si Ripae credamus, in L. ita Stipulatus. ff. de verb. oblig. n. 84.
.

5. The other Rule is, that if he or she do not let or hinder the Marriage at
or within the time appointed; the same time being past, he or she by whom it
does not stand, and wherefore the promise was not accomplished, is from thence
at liberty to marry elsewhere, as freely as if the former Spousals had not been

Spons. infra part. c. 5. n. 8.
.

6. Against which Conclusion there be diverse strong Objections Gloss. and. DD.
in. d.c. sicut.
, but this especially; Say that I do Covenant to pay unto thee x l. at or
before the Calends of the next Month, at which time I am ready to pay the Money,
and do indeed tender it accordingly, but thou can not, or wilst not receive
it: Albeit in this Case it does not stand by me, wherefore I do not pay the
Money at the time appointed, and so do not incur the penalty in that respect,
Yet I am not hereby acquitted from payment of the principal L. Celsus ff. de
recep. Arbitr.. 1. cum. Gloss. ibidem.
: And the reason is, because when I promise to pay such a Sum at such a time, I
promise two things, (the one the payment of the Money, the other at the time
appointed d. L. celsus.. 1. and ibidem Bar. and Baldus.
); And so though I have satisfied my promise in respect of the time, yet have I
not performed my promise in respect of the Sum; and in this respect I am still
subject to be sued for the principal, notwithstanding the lapse of the time
prescribed d. l. Celsus Card. and Panor. in d. c. sicut.
: Even so where the Man says to the Woman, or she to him, [I will Marry thee
at or before such a day], here two things be promised Arg. d. L. Celsus. 1.
etc. cum dilecti. de dolo and cont. extra.

nemo nescit, quod tempus non est modus vel inducendae, vel tollendae

; And therefore although this be lapsed, yet does the other remain still to be
accomplished. This is that strong Objection, in the answering whereof, if we
should behold the manifold and intricate Solutions of the Writers Gloss. in d.
c. sicut. quae tripliciter solvit, aliter tamen solvit. Jo. And. aliter
Hostiens. aliter Card. aliter Anto. de Butr. Panor. Praepof. and aliter Henr.

each of them does seem to overturn his fellow, and all of them to tumble
together by the Ears Truffas esse solutiones glossae dicit Anto. ipsum tamen,

, the Sight of this their Tumult would be much more wonderful, than the
rehearsing their several Assertions and Arguments could be profitable, as
tending rather to breed confusion than bring instruction Qui nimium emungit,
elicit sanguinem, and nimia altercatione amittitur saepe veritas.
: Wherefore I think it meet, out of these their troublesome Contentions, to pick
out some of the easiest and soundest Distinctions, wherewith this hard and
difficult Knot may be untyed: Understand therefore that in Contracts and Bonds
the time is sometimes set down to solicit the performance or accomplishment
thereof, and sometimes to limit and determine the same Panor. post. Gof. and
Anto de Butr. in c. sicut de Sponsal. extra. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. infra.
part c. 5. n. 8. verb. Secundo.
; In the former case the lapse of time does not work any dissolution of the
Contract, or deliverance of the Parties: In the second case it does Anto.
Panor. and Covar. ubi supra.
; Now if we would know whether the time be set down to solicit the
performance of any Contract, or to extinguish and determine the same, we have
two notable Precepts delivered to that end Anto. de Butr. in d. c. sicut, and
post eum Panor. eod. c. n. 11. and Praepos. n. 7.
; The first Precept is this; When the time is appointed in respect of some
thing to be performed by one of the Parties alone, then it is deemed to be set
down to solicit the performance of the Covenant or Bond Anto. Panor. and
Praepos. ubi supra. Lancel. lib. 2. Institut. Jur. Can. Tit. de Sponsal.
; such is the case objected, where one Party alone is to pay the Money; and
therefore the Principal Debt is not extinguished by the only lapse of time,
howsoever the Party were then ready to have fully satisfied, whatsoever was by
him to have been performed at the time prescribed L. Celsus.. 1. ff. de arbitr.
and ibi Bart. and Bald.
; But when the time is appointed in respect of some things to be mutually
performed by both Parties (as in our Case,) then is it deemed to be set down to
finish and determine the Covenant and Bond Panor. in d. e. sicut post. Anto.
; and therefore the one Party failing, in performing the Covenants at the time
prescribed, the other Party by whom it did not stand, is thereby set at liberty
as soon as the time of the accomplishment is past c. sicut de Sponsal. extra.
; for when any Man promises that he will marry such a Woman at such a time, It
is intended that he does so promise, with this secret Condition, viz. if she
will then also marry him; otherwise not Cardinal. Panor. Praepos. and DD. in d.
c. sicut. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. prima part, c. 5. n. 8. quem, si videbitur
legito. facit L. cum quid ff. si certum pet. L. Triticum. de verb. oblig. ff.
. The other Precept is this, Sometimes the time is set down to solicit the
accomplishment of a perfect Contract, and then the Bond is not dissolved by the
only lapse of time L. cedere diem. ff. de Verb. Signif. and ibi Alciatus. n.
10. Anto. de Butr. and Panor. in d. c. sicur and ibidem Praepos.
. Sometimes again it is set down to solicit the beginning of a new Contract,
to be made betwixt the Parties; and then it is dissolved by lapse of time
Panor. in d. c. sicut. in fin. and Praepos. ibidem post. Anto. de Butr. Lancel.
lib. 2. Instit. Jur. Can. Tit. de Sponsal.
; for thereby either Party does show his unwillingness to proceed to the
effecting of this imperfect Contract Panor. ubi supra.
. Now in our Case the Parties did not first Contract pure and simple Spousals,
and afterward appoint a time for Solemnization of the Marriage; for then, the
Contract being first perfect, had not been dissolved by lapse of time agreed on
afterward and ita consuluit Panor. ut ipse refert in fin. d. c. sicut. and
consentit Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. prima part, c. 5. n. 8. in fin.
; but even at the very first, the time was concluded upon, and set down by both
Parties, whereunto they referred the future Marriage, no perfect Contract going
before; and therefore, by voluntary suffering the time to slide, without any
offer of performance by either Party, the Spousals are dissolved Dom. Anton. in
d. c. sicut. and ibi Panor. qui hanc secundam Theoricam tanquam clariorem, and
veritati magis amicam laudat. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. prima part, c. 5. n. 8.
. And this I take to be the plainest and surest Answer to the former Objection.
But what if it does not stand, either by the Man or by the Woman, wherefore
they were not married at the time appointed, being hindered by some casual
means, or by some third person, whether in this Case be the Spousals dissolved
de hac q. Anto. de Butr. in d. c. sicut. and ibi Jo. And. and Praepos. n. 7. in
fin.
? I suppose not Cardinal. Henr. Boic. and Praepos. in d. c. sicut.
; and that if either he or she marry elsewhere they are to be punished,
howsoever the time prefixed be determined Praepos. and Boic. ubi supra.
; for though the impediment do excuse from punishment, for not marrying at the
appointed time, yet does it not dissolve the Covenant Cardinal and Praepos. ubi
supra. and facit L. quaesitum ff. de Reg. Jud.
; wherefore the impediment ceasing, they are to marry as soon as conveniently
they may Praepos. in d. c. sicut. n. 7. in fin. accedit c. cum dilecti. de dolo
and contumac. extra nec long abest Archi. in c. nupti. 27. q. 1.
, unless some other cause, beside the former impediment, or lapse of time, do
withstand the same veluti si cum alia persona per verba de praesenti
contraxerit d. c. sicut.
. And here note, That if the Parties do promise to marry together in such a
Month, or at such a Feast, as [in the Month of May, or at the Feast of St.
George, without saying next,] it is to be understood of the next Month of May,
or at the next Feast of St. George, unless the contrary do appear L. eum qui
Calendis. ff. de verb. oblig.
.

7. Conditional Spousals are they which be neither simple, nor referred to a
certain day, but whereunto some quality is annexed, or wherein some event is
expressed, whereby the force or effect i. e. obligatio and actio suspenduntur
L. cedere diem. ff. de Verb. Sign. and ibi ^lciat. Rebuff. and alii.
of the Contract is suspended Schneidwin. Tract. de Nuptiis, fol. 27. n. 34.
. For Example; [ I will take thee to my Wife if thou will give me 100 l. c. de
illis. de Condic. appos. extra.
,] or [ I do take thee to my Wife if my Father shall consent, etc. c. super eo.
de Condic. appos. extra.
] By which Examples we may perceive, That not only Spousals de futuro, but
Spousals de praesenti may be contracted conditionally Panor. in d. c. super eo.
n. 5. and in d. c. de illis. n. 2.
; and although in the later Case the words be of the present time, yet have
they not their effect presently, nor before the event of the Condition Panor.
in d. c. super. n. 5. and ibi Praepos. n. 2. Schneidwin. Tract. de Nup. fol.
27. n. 34. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part. c. 3. n. 2. lib. 1. consil.
matrim. consil. ibidem 64. n. 9.
.

8. Yet do not all manner of Conditions suspend the Contract, or enforce an
expectation of the event thereof ut infra. hoc. ipso.
; for in some Cases the conditional Contract is reputed simple, and has its
present force, as if no Condition had been expressed; and in some Cases the
Condition does utterly destroy the Contract Henr. Boic. in c. si Conditiones,
de condit. appos. extra. Summa Hostiens. in Rub. de Condic. appos. extra.. quae
conditio. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, Paragraphis 1, 2, 3.
: Wherefore that we may know when the event of the Condition is to be expected,
when not; and likewise when the Condition does destroy the Contract, when not;
we must observe these Distinctions. Conditions therefore, are either of that
which is past, or present, or to come: Conditions of future things be either
secretly understood, or expressed; the expressed are either necessary,
impossible, or possible; possible be either honest, or unhonest; unhonest
Conditions are either against the Substance of Matrimony, or not Has and alias
Conditionum Species videre est apud Summam Hostiens. in Rub. de Sponsal. extra.
qui triplicem ibidem divisionem constituit, prima autem Conditionum divisio
haec est. Alia (inquit) est tacita, alia expressa. Alia de praesenti, alia de

impossibilis rursus duplex, de Jure (quae and turpis dicitur) and de Facto.
Secunda vero divisio est possibilium, quae sunt vel potestativae, vel casuales,
vel mixtae. Tertia denique (quam tradit) divisio est, hujusmodi Conditio vel

impossibilis; vel inhonesta and possibilis; quae omnes si videbitur ibi

described.

Conditions respect either the time past present to come expressed necessary

secretly understood



9. Conditions referred to that which is past or present, do not suspend the
validity, nor defer the effect of the Contract, but do presently either confirm
or make void the same L. Institut. talis ff. de condic. and institut. L. cum ad
praesens ff. si cert. pet. Jas. and Dec. in eand. L. cum ad praesens.
. For Example, [I will have thee to my Wife if my Father be living, or were
alive within this Month, etc.] The Father being alive at the time contained in
the Condition, the Contract is presently good, otherwise being dead, the
Contract is presently void d. L. Institut. and ibi DD. Henric. Boic. in L. si
condition de condic. appos. extra. Hostiens. Summa eod. Tit.. quot Species.
Institut. pen. de verb. ob.
: wherefore these kind of Conditions, which be referred to the time past or
present, are improperly called Conditions Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda
part, c. 3.. 1. n. 9. per d. L. Institut. ff. de condic. and Institut. in fin.
pen. Institut. de verb. oblig.
.

10. Secret Conditions are these, and such like; [Si Deus voluerit, If God
will; Si vixero, If I shall shall live; Si potero, If I shall be able Epistol.
Jac. c. 4.. 15. gloss. and DD. in c. unic.. ultim. de Sponsal. lib. 6.
;] and they be called Secret Conditions, because they are evermore secretly
intended, though they be not expressed Arch. in c. unic. de Sponsal. in Sext.
in sin. vide Jo. Olden. Topic. legal. loco ab authoritate, scu prejudic. ubi
enumerat xx. tacitarum Conditionum exempla.
; and therefore when the Parties do contract Matrimony or Spousals together in
this manner, [I do take thee to my Wife, I will take thee to my Wife;] and she
likewise, [ I do take, or I will take thee to my Husband,] without expressing
any Condition, nevertheless these aforesaid Conditions, [If God will, If I
live, If I may by Law, etc.] are always secretly understood, and yet
nevertheless they do not make the Contract conditional, nor suspend the force
or effect thereof Innoc. in c. debitores. extra. de Jure Jur. Olden. ubi
isupra. Melchior Kling. de causis matrimonial. fol. 74. Henr. Boic. in c. si
Conditiones. de cond. app. extra.
, which Conclusion is undoubtedly true; whereas these Conditions are not
expressed, but understood Archid. in d. c. 1. de Sponsal. lib. 6. n. 12. Henr.
Boic. ubi supra. Summa Rosell. verb. matrimonium. 5. in princ.
. Indeed if the Parties shall express these Conditions in their Contracts, then
it is not without question, whether the Contract be Simple or Conditional ^d
quod manifestum est per Gloss. and DD. in c. unic. ultim. de Sponful. in Sext.
Silvestr. verb. matrimonium 8. q. 14. verb. Septim. and per Covar. Tract. de
Sponsai. secunda part. c. 6.. 2. n. 4.
; wherein whether Opinion is to be preferred, shall be satisfied (God willing)
e're long Infra hoc. paulo post.
.

11. By necessary Conditions, I mean those whereof there is an infallible
natural Cause, by force whereof the Effect must needs follow Sichard. in Rub.
de Institut. and sub. C. n. 7.
: and these Conditions do not suspend the Contract, nor make the same
Conditional Henr. Boic. in c. si Conditiones. de condic. appos. extra. Summa
Hostiens. eod. Tit.. quae condic. verb. Quid si Contraho.
; and therefore if the Parties do mutually promise Matrimony, [If the Sun shall
rise to morrow] it is as if they had simply promised Melchior. Kling. Tract. de
cause. matrimonial. fol. 73. Cardinal. Hostiens. Panor. and Praepos. in c. per
tuas. de condic. appos. extra.
. But if the words of the Contract be referred to the time of the event of the
Condition, then is the Contract Conditional, and the virtue thereof in suspense
until the Event do come, notwithstanding that the same be inevitable; as when
the Contract is made thus, [ If, and when the Sun shall enter into Libra, etc.
Henr. Boic. in c. si Conditiones. de condic. appos. extra. Covar. Tract. de
Spons. secunda part. c. 3.. 2 n. 11. and in hoc casu locum habet Gloss. in d.
c. per tuas. quam sequuntur Jo. And. and Dom. Anto.
] or thus, [If, and when my Father shall dye Jas. in l. impossibilis. ff. de
verb. oblig. in fin. quem citat Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. verum dies istius
Conditionis ( si Titius meriatur) est incerta non solum quando, sed etiam an
sit extitura. Quum Titius potest non mori, dum vivant contra^entes, Quod si
dies sit incerta an and quando sit ventura, Contractus est Conditionalis, Id
quod fatetur Cardinal. in d. c. per tuas de cond. app. in fin.
]; and so it is in case the Event be certain; but not by reason of any natural
Cause, as [ If Antichrist shall be born Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda
part, c. 3.. 2. n. 11. in fin. post Adrian. q. 17. de matrim.
:] If the Condition be conceived Negatively, under an impossible Condition, as
[If thou shall not touch the Skies with thy Finger;] it is in effect as if the
Parties had contracted simply without any Condition Minsing. in. si
impossibilis. Instit. de inutil. Stipul. n. 8.
: The Reason is, wheresoever the Affirmative is impossible; there the Negative
is necessary Bar. in l. impossibilis. ff. de verb. ob. and Minsing. ubi supra.
.

12. Impossible Conditions (in this place) are they whereunto Nature is an
impediment, that they cannot be accomplished; as [If thou shall touch the Skies
with thy Finger; If thou shall drink up all the Water in the Sea, etc..
impossibilis. Instit. de inutilibus Stipulac. Minsing. in. impossibilis.
Instit. de haered. instituend. n. 3.
]. These Conditions are in favor of Matrimony, utterly rejected and void, or
as if they were not at all mentioned c. si Conditiones. de Condit. app. extra.
Summa Hostiens. Rub. de Cond. app.. quae Conditio. Henr. Boic. and omnes DD. in
d. c. si Conditiones.
, and so the Contract qualified therewith is nevertheless reputed pure and
simple Panor. in d. c. si Conditiones. n. 3. Et hoc verum est favore
Matrimonij, quemadmodum and favore Testamenti.. impossibilis Instit. de haered.
instituend. In aliis autem contractibus, regulariter Conditio impossibilium
vitiat, et non vitiatur, (si juri civili attendaturus) ut Institut. de inutil.
Stipulat.. impossibilis. Jus autem municipale Regni nostri Angliae, quid de
Condition impossibili statuit, videre est apud Pereium, non inerudite de hac
re differentem. fol. (Libelli mei) 142. Tit. Condition.
, which Conclusion is very true, the impossibility being naturally perpetual:
But if the impossibility were not ever from the beginning, but did arise in
process of time by some accident, then is not the Condition void, but makes
void the Contract; as when the Man and the Woman do Contract Spousals or
Matrimony together conditionally, [If their Parents shall consent,] their
Parents being already dead, and so impossible that they should give any Consent
thereunto; for in this Case the Contract is void, notwithstanding the
impossibility of the Condition Praepos. in c. super eo. de condic. appos.
extra. n. 4. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 3.. 2. n. 3. in princ.
Specul. in Rub. de condic. app. extra. n. 4.
; which thing is the rather received, as more agreeable to the Truth, whereas
the Parties were then ignorant of the death of their Parents at the time of the
Contract Ita distinguit Jo. And. ut refert Praepos. ubi supra facit L. Servo
manumisso. ff. de cond. indebiti, nec dissentit. Covar. d. c. 3.. 2. n. 3.
verb. nifi possibilis videretur.
; for where the Parties are persuaded that the Condition is possible, although
in truth the same be naturally and perpetually impossible, yet is it not
rejected, but does make void the Contract wherewith it is qualified Covar.
Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 3.. 2. n. 5. Aretin. in L. impossibilis.
ff. de verb. oblig.
; and therefore if the Parties, being persuaded that the Stars of Heaven do
sometimes fall down to the Earth, and there melt away, do Contract Matrimony
together conditionally, [If some Star do fall from the Sky to the Earth before
such a time] this Contract is made void by this impossible Condition Covar. ubi
supra verb. si enim.
, because the Parties did not otherwise intend to Contract Matrimony, nor yield
their Consents (but in Case this Case, which they thought possible) did come to
pass Covar. ubi supra. Cui continuit Hadr. in c. de matr. quaest. 6, 7.
, without which Consent true Matrimony is never Contracted L. Nuptias. ff. de
Reg. Jur. c. cum locum, and ibi DD. de Sponsal. extra.
. And so where two contract Matrimony [If their Parents shall consent] it
seems that they did not otherwise intend to marry, but in case their Parents
should like and allow thereof c. super eo. in fin. de condic. app. extra. and
ibi Praepos. n. 4. Covar. Tract de Spons. secunda part, c. 3.. 2. n. 5.
: Howbeit if the Parties, when they did mutually promise Matrimony
conditionally, if their Parents should consent, did know they were dead, and so
could not consent, then is the Condition void, not the Contract Jo. And. in
addic. ad Specul. de condic. appos. litera (d) facit L. mulcta ff. de condic.
and demon. and Bar. in L. 1. de condic. and Instit. ff. col. 2. Covar. Tract.
de Spons. secunda part, c. 3.. 2. n. 3. verb. quod si in futur. etc.
, unless it appear to be the meaning of the Parties, by expressing an
impossible Condition, not to yield their Consents, but to dally the one with
the other; for in such a Case evermore the Contract is of no force, for want of
true meaning and perfect consent Praepos. in c. super co. de Sponsal. extra. n.
4. per c. Tua nos. de Spons. extra.
.

13. The Sum of this that I have here delivered (that I may make it somewhat
plainer) is no more but a Rule and three Limitations. The Rule is, That
impossible Conditions are rejected. The first Limitation is, when the
impossibility arises by some accident. The second, when the Parties did
believe the Condition possible. The third, when they had no meaning thereby to
Contract themselves, but to delude either the other. Whereunto a fourth may be
added, namely, when as the impossibility indureth only whiles the Parties are
alive together: As if the Man say, [I contract Matrimony with thee, if thou
shall come to my Funeral or Burial;] or thus [I will marry thee, if thou do not
disclose such a secret,] with Conditions, because they are against the
Substance of the Act, nor can be fully accomplished whiles the Parties are
alive, resist the Nativity of the Bond or Obligation, and so make void the
Contract Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part. c. 3.. 1. n. 15. Adrian. in
4. de Matrimonio. q. 5.
; neither does Carnal Copulation thereupon ensuing betwixt the said Parties,
beget the presumption of Matrimony betwixt them in this Case Covar. post
Adrian. ubi supra.
.

14. Possible Conditions are those which be neither necessary nor impossible,
but being placed in the midst betwixt both extremes, are indifferent either to
be, or not to be Summa Hostiens. de cond. app. extra.. quae conditio. Sichard.
in Rub. de instit. and sub. C^^n. 9. Melchior Kling. Tract. de cause.
Matrimonial. fol. 73.
. These possible Conditions, (if they be honest withal, (that is to say) not
against Law, nor repugnant to good and wholesome Manners) do suspend the
Contract c. de illis. c. super eo. de cond. app. extra and ibi Jo. And. Card.
Panor. and Praepos.
, so that, in the mean time, the Parties contracting Spousals or Matrimony,
under any such Conditions, are neither bound, nor suable, until the Condition
be extant d. c. de illis. etc. super, and ibi DD. Schneidwin. Tract. de
Nuptiis, fol. 27. Melchior Kling. Tract. de cause. matrimonial. fol. 74.. sub
condition. and. ex conditionali. Instit. de verb. oblig. L. cedere ff. de
Verb. Sign. and ibi DD.
. For Example, [ I will contract Matrimony with thee, if thou will give me 100
l. c. de illis. de cond. app. extra.
]; or thus, [I do contract Matrimony with thee, if thy Father shall consent c.
super eo de cond. appos. extra.
,] depending the Condition (that is to say, until thou give 100 l. or until thy
Father consent) there is neither Obligation nor Action, either for Spousals or
for Matrimony Summa Hostiens. in Rub. de cond. appos. extra.. quae conditio. in
princ. Schneidwin. Tract. de Nuptiis, fol. 27. n. 34. d. c. super eo. and ibi
DD.
. And albeit in the second Example the words be uttered in the Present Tense,
yet by means of the Condition thereunto annexed, the force and efficacy of the
Contract is suspended, until the event of the Condition Panor. in d. c. super
eo. n. 5. and ibi Praepos. notab. 6.
: For if we will speak properly, Matrimony is not contracted, but when the
Consent is pure and without Condition, as well as present Covar. Tract. de
Sponsal. secunda part, c. 3. n. 3. and facit L. actus legitimi ff. d. Reg. Jur.
; wherefore I cannot choose but think that they did plainly err, and wander far
from the right Path, who thought and taught, That present Consent, albeit
Conditional, did forthwith induce Matrimony, notwithstanding the Condition were
not as yet extant unic. in d. c. super eo. and Specul. in Rub. de condic.
appos. extra. n. 2.
; and contrariwise, that their Opinion is guided by the straight line of Equity
and truth, who do hold that the words, being conceived in the Future tense, (as
in the former Example) neither Matrimony, neither Spousals is contracted,
before the accomplishment of the Condition Innoe. in c. 1. de cond. appos.
extra. Jo. And. in c. de illis. and Henr. Boic. in c. si conditiones. eod. tit.
; and that the words being framed in the Present tense, (as in the later
Example) they have the force of Spousals only Panor. in c. super eo de condic.
appos. extra. n. 7.
, or rather not so much Covar. tract. de Sponsal. 2. part c. 3. n. 2. per
text. in c. 1.. ultim. de Spons. in Sext.
, until the Condition be extant; Indeed, the Conditions being performed, then
are they Spousals in that Case, and Matrimony in this Innoc. in c. 1. de
condic. appos. and Henr. Boic. in c. si Conditiones. eod. tit. extra. Covar.
tract. de Sponsal. 2. parto. c. 3. nu. 2.
: Whereby we may gather two Rules concerning those kind of Contracts, The one,
that depending the honest possible Condition, the Contract is suspended Innoc.

Panor. and Praepos. Hostiens. Summa Tit. decond. appos.. quae Conditio.

. The other, that the foresaid Condition being performed, the Contract is then
purified, or as if no Condition had been expressed d. c. de illis. etc. super
eo. and ibi DD. L. potior ff. qui potiores in pig. hab. c. fraterintatis. de
frigid. and malef. extra.
. Either of which two rules has two several Limitations thereto belonging.

15. The Limitations of the former Rule are these; First when the Parties after
they have contracted Conditional Spousals de praesenti, or de futuro, do before
the event of the Condition know each other Carnally, for by this corporal
Copulation they are deemed to have renounced the Condition; and presently to
yield their mutual Consents to Contract and consummate pure and perfect
Matrimony c. per tuas. de condic. appos. extra. and ibi gloss.
, which Conclusion is diversely both enlarged and restrained Menoch. Tract. de
Praesump. lib. 3. praes. 1. Covar. tract. de Spons. prima part. c. 4.. 1.
; as when we shall entreat of the effect of carnal Copulation more plentifully
shall appear Infra.. 17.
.

16. Secondly, when the Parties, after the Conditional Contract, do simply, or
without any Condition express their mutual Consents by words of the present
time, fit for Matrimony; for in this Case also they are deemed to have
renounced the Condition; and are presently joined in simple Matrimony, as if no
Condition had been before expressed c. de illis. de condit. appos. extra. and
ibi gloss. c. de illis. de despons. impub. extra. and ibi DD.
.

17. The Limitations of the second Rule are these; First when the Condition was
infringed, before it was completed, for being once infringed, the
accomplishment following is not regarded L. bones.. Sermon ff. de verb.
Signif. Praepos. in c. super eo. de condic. appos. extra. n. 4.
: For Example; the Parties having Contracted Matrimony [if their Parents shall
consent], So it is, that their Parents do first dissent, but afterward upon
further advisement their minds being altered, they become willing, and do now
yield their Consents thereunto, this new Consent does not re-establish the
Matrimony before dissolved by their dissent Praepos. in d. c. super eo.
Tiraquel. in d.. hoc sermon. verb. octogesimo primo. Clavas. in Summa Angel.
verb. Matrimonium. el. 3. in tertio impedimento. n. 2.
: Albeit some Writers (but without sufficient Warrant I fear) do hold the
Contrary, in case the Parties do still persevere in their former purpose, until
their unwilling Parents do at the last yield their Consents thereunto Cardinal.
in c. super eo de condit. appos. extra. Silvester. Prier. verb. Matrimonium el.
3. n. 4. verse. tertium. in fin.
.

18. Secondly, when as one of the Parties depending, the Condition does
Contract pure and perfect Matrimony with some other Person: This second
Matrimony simply contracted, is not overthrown by the succeeding Accomplishment
of the Condition of the former Contract c. 1.. ultim. de Sponsal. in Sext. and
ibi DD. gloss. in c. per tuas. de condic. appos. extra. and Panor. in c. super
eo. eod. tit. n. 7. and facit. c. quamvis. de rescrip. in Sext. Praepos. in d
c. per tuas. n. 7.
: For Example; a Man and a Woman do contract Matrimony conditionally, [If their
Parents shall consent thereunto] before which Consent the Man does, without any
Condition, contract perfect Matrimony with another Woman, after which Contract
the Parents yield their Consents to the former Contract: In this Case the
second absolute Contract, does prevail against the former conditional Contract
Panor. ubi supra. Praepos. in c. per tuas de condic. appos. extra. n. 7. and
ibi gloss. Schneidwin. Tract. de nuptijs. fol. 28. Summa Rosella. verb.
Matrimonium el. 5. verse. quid si quis, etc.
.

19. Against this Limitation it is commonly objected; That a Condition purified
is understood to be retired back again, to the time wherein the Contract was
first made; and to be of force, not ex nunc, but ex tunc, that is to say, not
from the time of the actual performance of the Condition, but as if it had been
even then accomplished at the very beginning L. potior. ff. qui potior. in
pign. hab. facit. l. haeres quandocunque. de acquir. haered. and ^. quod dic.
de terto. Mil. ff.
; or rather as if the Contract had always been pure and simple Gloss. in c. per
tuas. de condic. appos extra. Reusner. tract. de Causis Matrimonial. consil. 2.
n. 40, and 41. Socin. Jun. consil. 35. n. 2. vel. 1.
.

20. To which Objection, this is the ready Solution. That the purified
Condition is then supposed to be retired backward, when as the Case in the mean
time is not altered, nor the way stopped, or the passage hindered Panor. in d.
c. per tuas. in fin. and ibi Praepos. n. 7. Bar. in l. si indebitat.. 1. ff.
rem. rat. hab. etc. quamvis de rescrip. lib. 6.
; But in our Case the way is intercepted, and the return let by means of a
perfect Contract, substantially made; and finished during the imperfection of
the former Contract Quippe, quia pendente Condition, actus non dic. necessario
perfectus. quod si penden. de peric. and com. rei vend. Paris. consil. 82. vol.
4. n. 6. Reusner. tract. de cause. Matrimonial. consil. 2. n. 5. qui tandem in

, by force whereof the accomplished Condition is repelled, and not suffered to
have recourse to the first Fountain, from whence it did originally issue, or
proceed Panor. and Praepos. in c. per tuas. de condic. appos. extra. alter nu.
8. alter. n. 7. Schneidwin. tract. de nuptijs fol. 28. Melchior. Kling. Tract.

; And it is so much the more forceably repelled, when as the second Contract is
consummate with carnal Copulation; for then, as well by the Civil Law
Reusnerus. Tract. de cause. Matrimonial. consil. 2. n. 26. cum Seq. per l.
semper in conjunctionibus. ff. de rit. nup. and per Auth. itaque C. comm. de
Success. Exemplo L. quoties de rei vendic. and L. five autem.. Si duabus. de
pub. in rem. act. ff.
, as by the Canon Law c. per literas. de Sponsal. extra. Reusnerus bui supra.
, this consummated Contract does overthrow the former conditional Contract:
Marry Sir, if the Condition expressed in the former Contract, be not a
voluntary Condition, but such a Condition, as had it not been expressed, yet,
nevertheless is secretly understood; Then whether this Contract prevail against
the second Contract of Matrimony, wherein no Condition at all is expressed, is
a doubtful Question; wherein some do affirm Archid. in c. unic. de Sponsal. in
Sext. in sin.
, and some deny Cardinal. in d. c. unic.
, and some leave it doubtful Clavas. Summa Angel. verb. Matrimonium.
Impediment. 3. versic. Sed nunquid. qui sane obscure loquitur, dum necessarium
per necessarium and contingens distinguere videtur, Id quod animadvertit.
Silvestr. verb. Matrimonium. 8. q. 14. verse. Septimum in fin.
; or if the Condition of the former Contract were a voluntary Condition, before
the accomplishment whereof, one of the Parties contracted, did not actually
proceed to any Contract of Matrimony with any other, but verbally dissented and
disclaimed from the Contract made, Whether by this dissent only, the
conditional Contract be dissolved is a question, wherein all Men are not of one
mind Ut per gloss. and DD. in c. super co. de condic. appos. extra.
; and yet as well this, as that, no less needful to be known to us, than
doubtfully delivered by them; in regard whereof, it shall not be in vain, I
hope, if we review either Case a little more diligently, and so grow to some
certainty.

21. In the former Case therefore, that is to say, when two Persons do contract
Matrimony together expressing this Condition, viz. [Si Deus voluerit, if God
will, or Si vixero, If I shall live; or Si potero, If I shall be able, etc.]
some (as I said) affirm that this is a pure and simple Contract Archid. in c.
unic. de Sponsal. in Sext. in fin. Henr. Boic. in c. si Conditiones. de condic.
appos. extra. in princ. Melch. Kling. tract. de cause. Matr. fol. 73. in fin.
and 27. in princ.
; and therefore good against a second Contract, whose reason does chiefly rest
upon this Conclusion, Expressio eorum quae tacit insunt nihil operatur L. 3.
de lega. 1. L. condit. de cond. and demon. ff.
, the expressing of those things which be secretly included works nothing.
And so the expressing of that Condition which is secretly included in the
Contract, does not make it Conditional Henr. Boic. in c. si Conditiones. de
condic. appos. extra. ubi aliam assignat rationem, nempe quia ista Conditio [Si
deus voluerit] licet quoad verba sit de futuro, tamen quoad veritatem (inquit)
est de praesenti, ideoque non suspenditur.
; for those Conditions [If God will Epist. Jacob. c. 4. v. 15. c. beatus 22. q.
2. Innoc. in c. debitores de Jure jur. extra.
, If I live Epist. Jacob. ubi supra L. ultim. ff. Si quis cautionibus
, If I may L. impossibilium ff. de Reg. Jur. L. continuus.. illud. de verb.
oblig. ff.
], are secretly included in every disposition, be it never so simple, or never
so pure, never so not conditional; being therefore called tacitae Conditiones,
Secret Conditions, and legitimae Conditiones Jo. Olden. Topic. Legel. loco. ab
authoritate fol. (mihi) 105.
legal Conditions, because the Law does supply and understand these Conditions,
though the Parties do omit them: To which purpose writes Oldendorpe in these
words, Multa saepenumero insunt negotijs etiamsi non exprimantur nominatim, ut
sunt Conditiones legitimae, non ex voluntate seu Consensu hominum, Sed ex
authoritate Juris procedentes, and haec quidem non faciunt negotium
Conditionale Olden. ubi supra.
. Therefore there be many things in our affairs very often, although they be
not expressed by name, as are legal Conditions, proceeding not from the Will or
Consent of Men, but from the Authority of Law; and those do not make the Act
conditional. Seeing then they do not make the Act conditional, not being
expressed, being expressed they make it not conditional; for Taciti and
expressi par virtus, aequalis potestas, eadem ratio Everard. loco ab. expresso
ad tacitum., and contra.
; tacitae Conditionis expressio non reddit dispositionem conditionalem Bar,
Jas. Zas. and alij DD. in L. 3. ff. de leg. 1.
, of that which is secret, and that which is expressed, Summa Hostiens. in Rub.
de condic. appos. extra. Dominic. and Phil. franc. in c. unic. de Spons. in
Sext. in fin Bar. and alij in L. 3. ff. de leg. 1.
there is like virtue, equal power, and the same reason; the expressing of a
secret Condition does not make the disposition conditional; which Position
being true, then it follows necessarily, that the second Contract is not
good; For if any Man do simply contract Matrimony with two several Women, the
first Contract shall prevail c. si inter de Sponsal. extra.
; Contrariwise some do stick to this Opinion, That the Contract of Matrimony,
wherein these Conditions [if it shall please God, if I shall be alive, if I
shall be able, etc.] be expressed, are conditional Covar. tract. de Sponsal. 2.
part c. 6.. 2. n. 4. Felin. in c. 2. de Sponsal. extra. in princ. Hostiens. in

viz. col. 4. and ibidem Cardinal. Prier. in Summa quae dic. Silvestrin. verb.
Matrimonium. el. 8. q. 13. versic. Seplin.
; and therefore, if either of the Parties do simply Contract Matrimony with
some other Person, the second Contract is good, notwithstanding the former
Siquidem Contractum, pendente Condition, simpliciter factum valere. Communis
est Summa. gloss. and DD. in c. per tuas. de condic. appos. extra.
; and certainly I must needs say, that if the antecedent be sure, the
consequent is sound, that is to say, if the former Contract be conditional, the
second Contract not conditional is good Gloss. in c. per tuas. and Panor. in c.

: So that hic labor hoc opus est, here is the very pinch; and this is the

nevertheless are forbidden, both by Gods Law, and Man's Law: As they which be a

; and they which only seek to satisfy their foul Lusts, like brute Beasts,
never considering the true Causes, for which Matrimony was ordained Silva

; and such like Infra. 2. part.
: Wherefore when any Man does contract Matrimony under these terms [if it
please God, or if I may, etc.] it is in effect as if he had thus said [I am not
certain whether it be Gods Will, or whether the Laws will permit, that I Marry
thee; for it may be thou art my near Kinswoman, or thou art already assured to
another Man, or some impediment there may be, which at this present I do not
know; But if it shall appear, that there is not any such impediment either by
Gods Law, or Man's Law; but that we may be joined together in Wedlock, and live
together as Man and Wife, I do here contract Matrimony with thee Covar. Tract.
de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 6.. 2. n. 4. Prier. in sua Summa, quae dicitur
Silvestrina. verb. Matrimonium. el. 8. q. 14. versic. Septimo, qui tamen ibi
distinguunt quos velim videas ipse.
]: And there is a very strong Text for this Construction, where it is written,
That if a Man do bequeath any thing in his Will to any other Person, with this
Proviso [Si volet L. Si ita legatum.. 1. ff. de leg. 1. and Covar. ubi supra.
, If he will] this Legacy is conditional eod.. 1.
, because these words [Si volet, If he will] do carry this sense, If it appear
that he be willing Bar. Jas. and alii DD. in d. L. si ita.
. And so in our Case these Conditions [Si Deus voluerit; Si potero, etc. If God
will; If I may,] are thus to be understood, [Si apparuerit Deum velle, vel me
posse Prier. verb. Matrimonium. el. 3. n. 3. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda
part, c. 6.. 2. n. 4.
, If it shall appear that God be willing, or that I may:] Therefore until it
appear whether God be willing; that is to say, until it be known, whether there
be any thing in God's Law, or Man's Law, to hinder this Marriage; in the mean
time the Contract is suspended as a Conditional Contract Prier. and Covar. ubi
supra.
. To the Reasons or Grounds of the former Opinion, namely, That the expressing
of those things which be secretly included has no operation, or that there is
like virtue, equal power, and the same Reason of that which is secret and that
which is expressed; or that a secret Condition expressed does not make the
disposition Conditional, etc. One Answer is yielded to them all, (the Positions
being all but one in Sense and Substance) which Answer is this; That these
Positions are all true, quando tacitum non aliter exprimitur quam inest Bart.
in l. si it a legatum.. 1. and leg. 1. n. 2. and ibi Paul. de Castr^n. 5.
Panor. in c. significasti. de elect. n. 6. and Felin. in c. ad audientiam el 2.
n 10.
, when this Secret is not otherwise expressed outwardly, than it is inwardly;
that is to say, when the sense and meaning of that which is expressed, does not
differ from that which is included; for when they both agree in one meaning,
then both have one effect Bar. Paul. de Castr. Panor. and Felin. ubi supra.
, and so the Contract is pure and simple, and not conditional: And although
this Condition [Si Deo placuerit, If it shall please God,] in respect of the
words, be of the Future Tense, and so may seem to suspend the Contract Gloss
and DD. in c. unic. de Sponsal. in Sext.
, at least for a while; yet (as our old Countryman Boic writes very pithily)
quoad veritatem ista Conditio est de praesenti Henric. ^oic. in c. si
conditicnes de cond. appos. extra. in princ.
, In respect of the truth this Condition is of a thing present, and so the
Contract does not admit any further delay or expectation of future event Henr.
Boic. ubi supra. and in c. ad audientiam de Sponsal. extra.
, and therefore not conditional Quippe quae ad praesens, vel ad praeteritum
refertur Conditio, nec suspendit actum, nec conditionalem reddit, etiamsi

; I mean, when this Condition [Si Deo placuiret, If it shall please God, etc.]
is so expressed as understood Praepos. in c. ad audientiam. de Sponsal. extra.
col. ultim.
, that is, referred to the secret Will of God, against the which nothing can be
done Dominus exercituum decrevit quis poterit infirmare? Inquit Isaias c. 14.
verse. 27. and Paul. Epist. ad Roman. c. 9. verse. 19. voluntati ejus quis

; not to his Will revealed, against the which many things are done Genes. c. 3.
verse. 11. Romans c. 5. n. 12. c. merito. etc. ita. 15. q. 1.
; for then, as I said before, the Contract is conditional, because it is
otherwise expressed than is included Praepos. in c. ad audientiam de Sponsal.
extra. ultim. col.
; for being expressed, it is referred to the Will revealed Silvest. Prier.
Verb. Matrimonium. el. 3. q. 3. in sin.
, which some call voluntatem signi Ibidem.
; whereas being not expressed, it is referred to his secret Will, which they
call voluntatem beneplaciti Ibidem.
. But you will say, What has this Distinction of God's secret and revealed
Will to do, where the Condition is not [If God will, If it please God, etc.]
but [Si vixero, If I live; Si illa vicissim in me consenserit, If she likewise
consent to me,] and such like. You say well; therefore to meet with this and
the like Questions, diverse Authors have devised diverse Distinctions Summa
Angel. verb. Matrimonium, Imped. 3. n. 1. Summa Silvestr. verb. Matrimonium..
3. q. 3. and. 8. q. 14. verse. septimum Adrian. in 4. de Matrimonio. circa q. 4.
: Some make difference, whether this secret Condition be necessary to the Act,
as [If I live;] or to the Consent, as If it shall please the Church Adrian. ubi

:] Teaching that in the former Case, the Condition being expressed, does not
make the Contract conditional, but in the later it does Adrian. ubi supra. quem
sequiter Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 6.. 2. n. 4
. Others have invented this Distinction; That some Conditions are so
necessarily included, as without the same the Contract cannot hold Prier. verb.
Matrimonium. 8. q. 13. versic. septimum post. Clavas. verb. Matrimonium

; and these, albeit expressed, do not suspend the Contract, nor make it
conditional Prier. and Clavas. eisdem locis.
: Of this sort are these Conditions, [If I live, If she likewise consent, etc.
Prier. and Clavas. ubi supra.
]. And some again are not so precisely necessary, as without the which the
Contract does utterly perish, but are rather included de been esse, and for
avoiding of sin Summa Angel. verb. Matrimonium Impediment. 3. versic. sed
nunquid and Silvestr. Prier. verb. Matrimonium.. 3. q. 3. and. 8. q. 13.
versic. septimum.
; of this sort are these foresaid Conditions, [Si Deo non displicuerit, Si Jura
non contradixerint Silvestr. Prier. de. 8. versic. septimum qui tamen tbi
profert exempla praesentis temporis, nempe nisi Deo displiceat, nisi sit contra
Jura, etc.
; If it shall not displease God, If the Laws will not gainsay it.] And these
Conditions being expressed make the Contract conditional, and do suspend the
Act, until the truth thereof do appear Silve. str. ibidem.
.

22. Now to the other Controversy not altogether so difficult, whereof the
Case is this; A Man and a Woman contract Matrimony together, expressing some
voluntary Condition, viz. [If their Parents shall consent,] before the
accomplishment of which Condition (that is to say, before their Parents do
consent,) one of the Parties expressly then dissenteth, and disclaimeth from the
Contract; which done, their Parents do consent; whether in this Case the
conditional Contract be purified and made perfect Matrimony, is a Question,
wherein all Men are not of one Judgment Gloss. and DD. in c. super eo. De
condic. appos. extra.
: For some say that it is Panor. in d. c. super eo. n. 7.
, others that it is not Anto. de Butr Phil Franc. and Praepos. in d. c. super

Rosella. verb. Matrimonium 5. verse. quid si quis. Summa Silvestrin. verb.
Matrimonium. 3. q. 4. in princ.
; howbeit, the Authors of the Affirmative, as they are but few in number Solus
enim stat Panor. in hac Sententia, si is stare sit dicendus, and non vacillare
potius, qui dubitanter loquitur in d. c. super eo.
, so are their Reasons weak and feeble Argumenta glossae sunt L. si mandassem
ff. mandati. c. ex part, de rescript. etc. mandato. de procur. ff. sed male ut

contrariam Sententiam descendit, ratio vero qua nititur Panor. Sumitur ex L.
Potior ff. Qui pot. in pig.
; for their strongest Reason (that I read of) is this, They which have
contracted Matrimony together conditionally, are to expect the event of the
Condition, and ought not to revoke their Consent in the mean time Panor. in
d.c. super eo. perd. l. potior. and ibi glossa. per c. de illis. de despons.
impub. extra.
; and therefore if either of them notwithstanding do revoke his or their
Promise, this revocation being prohibited by Law, is not to be regarded Ex quo
( inquit Panor. in d. c. super eo) obligavit se sub condition; non potuit ab
illa obligatione recedere.
, and consequently the Condition being accomplished, the Contract is to be
deemed, as if no dissent had ever been interposed; that is to say, for a pure
and absolute Contract of Matrimony. Whereunto it is fully and truly answered,
That albeit the Parties, conditionally contracted, are to expect the event of
the Condition Id quod utrinque cenceditur, Praepos. in d.c. super eo. n. 3. in
fin. Covar. Tract de Sponsal. secunda part. c. 3. n. 6.
, being an honest and possible Condition, as this is, yet does it not follow,
that if either Party do indeed dissent and disclaim, the same ought therefore
not to be regarded; for who knows not this Lesson, Multa prohibentur fieri,
quae tamen facta firmitatem obtinent c. ad applicam, de regular. and transeun.
extra. c. nos novimus. 17. q. 2. etc. si vir. 27. distinct.
, Many things are forbidden to be done, which notwithstanding, being done, are
of force; which Conclusion is beautified with no less than twenty Cases or
Examples collected by Jason Jas. in l. pr' surioso. ff. de his qui sui, vel al
jur.
the Civilian (no less famous for his Golden Lectures; than Jason of Thessaly
for his Golden Fleece). Again, If this Prohibition were of that strength and
might, that it did overthrow all contrary Acts, achieved and executed,
depending the Condition of the former Contract, then also the second Contract
of Matrimony made before the accomplishment of the Condition of the former
Contract, should be overthrown by force of the said Prohibition Eadem enim
ratione in utroque casu militante, and idem nos constitui oportet, nec Casus
diversitas sed rationis identitas inspici debet. Cavetta consil. 190. vol 1. n.
2. and consil. 183. n 3.
, for the less being prohibited, the greater is the rather prohibited Peckius
in c. cui licet. de Reg. Jur. in Sext. in princ.
; that is to say, if the Parties be prohibited to dissent only, much more are
they prohibited to contract Matrimony with any other Person depending the
Condition of the former Contract. But even by their own Confession, who plant
their chief hold upon this Prohibition, the second absolute Contract is good,
notwithstanding the suspense of the Condition of the former Contract, and
notwithstanding that the same Condition is afterward accomplished Panor. in c.
super eo. de condic. appos. extra. n. 7.
; nor that only, but they do also yield a Reason thereof, namely, That the
conditional Contract has no more force, but of Spousals de futuro, depending
the Condition Panor. ubi supra.
; and therefore by their own Reason they overthrow their own Assertion; for if
a conditional Contract of Matrimony have no more force than Sponsals de futuro
(as indeed it has not, neither yet so much Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda
part. c. 3. n. 5.
, during the suspense of the Condition;) Therefore if either of the Parties
withdraw their consent before the accomplishment of the Condition, then cannot
these Spousals by the Fathers consent become Matrimony Praepos. in d. c. super
eo n. 3. and ibi. Cardinal. in fin. Covar. ubi supra n. 5. and 6.
: For this is without question, That without pure and perfect consent of both
Parties, Matrimony cannot be contracted c. sufficiat 27. q. 2. L. Nuptias ff.
Reg Jur. c. cum locum. de Sponsal. extra. and ibi DD.
. And to be brief, this is the principal Reason which the Authors of the
Negative Opinion do use for proof thereof, namely, the defect of pure and
perfect Consent d. c. sufficiat. and d. L. nuptias DD. in c. super eo. de cond.
appos. extra. Covar. tract. de Sponsal. 2. part c. 3. n. 5, and 6.
. This is that Wall of Brass which the Adversaries may well shoot at, but are
never able to batter, nor make any breach into; neither is it material whether
the other Party or Parents were witting or ignorant of this dissent Ant. de
Butr. Phil. franc. and Praepos. in d. c. super eo. Arg. c. ultim. de procur. in
Sext. and Covar. ubi supra.
; for neither in the one Case, nor in the other, can there be any perfect
Matrimony for want of the Parties perfect Consent, at such time as the Parents
yield their Consent Silvestr. Prier. verb. Matrimonium. 3. q. 4. in princ.
; for even then also ought both Parties to agree Gloss. in c. super eo de
condic. appos. extra. Summa Rosella. verb. Matrimonium. el. 5. versic. Quid si.
in one and the same Mind, otherwise there is not Consensus, i. e. simul sensus
Geminian. in c. si oblato. de literis contestat. in Sext.
, and consequently no Matrimony.

23. Well, let us vary the Case a little, and see what will become of it. Say
that the Parties having contracted Matrimony together conditionally, [If their
Parents shall consent] do neither of them dissent, but do both persevere still
in the same purpose until their Parents be acquainted therewith, who make no
show to or fro, by expressing either Consent or Dissent; Whether in this Case
is it to be adjudged for Matrimony, or not?

24. Some are of opinion, That forasmuch as the Parents did not precisely
perform the Condition, that is to say, formally express their Consents,
therefore it is no Matrimony Clavasius in Summa, quae dicitur Angelica. verb.
Matrimonium Imped. 3. versic. Sed quid si.
: But the greater part incline to the contrary Opinion Cardinal. post.
Hostiens. in c. super eo de condic. appos. extra. and ibi Piaepos. n. 4.

Felin. in Rub. de Sponsal. extra.
, it is as if they had formally and expressly yielded their Consents DD. in d.c.
super eo.
.

25. To that, that Conditions are to be precisely performed L. qui haeredi.. 1.
and L. Maevius. ff. de condic. and demon.
, it is answered; That Is true generally in other Contracts; but in a Contract
of Matrimony it is special, that the Condition is sufficiently performed by
other aequivalent means, as well as by precise observation of the strict form
of the Condition Cardinal. and Praepos. in d. c. super eo.
; and so the Common Opinion is to be preferred, at least if the Parties do not
afterward break off, and bestow themselves in Marriage otherwise Quod si ad
secundavota deventum fuerit, tunc alteram opinionem, uti veriorem amplectitur,
Clavasius in sua Summa Angelica. verb. Matrimonium. Imped. 3. verse. Sed quod Si.
.

26. What shall we say to this case? A Man and a Woman do contract Matrimony
conditionally, [ if he give her 100 l. at such a time]; Which Woman afterward
does also contract Matrimony with another Man, under the same Condition, that
is, [ if he give her 100 l. at the time aforesaid]: Which time being come,
either of these Men gives to this Woman 100 l. at one and the same instant; in
this Case Whether Contract shall prevail?

27. By the Common Opinion of such as write upon this question, neither
Contract shall prevail Jo. And in c. 1. de cond. app. extra. qui rejectis

, by reason of the uncertainty Arg. L. si fuerit ff. de reb. dub. L. Duotitij
ff. de testa. c. ex literis. el. 2. de Sponsal. extra.
; for since it is uncertain which Condition was first performed, it cannot be
certain, whether Matrimony is to be perferred: And therefore it is of no more
force, than if she had contracted Matrimony with two several Men at once Summa

29. Unhonest Conditions against the Substance of Matrimony, are they which be
repugnant to any of the three Substantial good things, or Blessings for which
Matrimony was ordained DD. in c. fin. de cond. appos. extra.

. Wherefore these Conditions [ Si prolis generationem evitaveris, if thou shall
avoid generation of Children, Si adulterand' te tradideris, if thou will play
the Adulteress, Donec inveniam meliorem, until I find a better].

30. These Conditions, I say, and every of them are not only unhonest, but also
against the Substance of Matrimony, for that they be opposed to those things,
without the which true Matrimony cannot consist Text. in c. ultim. de condic.
appos. extra. and ibi Praepos. n. 5. Covar. tract. de Sponsal. 2. part c. 3..
1. n. 1. Silvester Prier. verb. Matrimonium. 4. q. 5.
; and therefore if two Persons shall contract Spousals or Matrimony together,
under any of these aforesaid Conditions, this their Contract is void in Law
d.c. ultim. infra part. c. aliquando. 32. q. 2. faciat L. cum lic.. Si

: Whereas if the Condition were only unhonest, but not against the Substance of
Matrimony, the Condition were rejected, and the Contract good eod. c. ultim.
secunda part.
; either of which Rules have their several Ampliations and Limitations: But
before we descend thereunto, it is requisite to foresee what may be objected
against the former general Rule.

31. First therefore, where I affirmed this Condition [Si prolis generationem
evitaveris, if thou shall avoid the generation of Children] destroys the
Contract c. ultim. de condic. app. extra. c. aliquando. 32. q. 2.
, because it does withstand the first and principal good of Matrimony, viz.
bonum prolis Praepos. in d.c. ultim. n. 2. Covar. tract. de Sponsal. 2. part.
c. 3.. 1. in princ.
, the good of Children. It may be objected; That if a Man do contract Matrimony
with a Woman conditionally, [if she shall lead her life in perpetual
Continency] does not make void the Contract Bald. in. 4. distinct. 30. q. 2.
conclus. 2. de quo Covar. ubi supra.
: This Condition (albeit directly against the first and principal end of
Marriage, namely bonum prolis, the good of Children) is not void, which
objection is the rather confirmed by the example of Joseph and Mary, betwixt
whom there was true, perfect and inseparable Matrimony, notwithstanding the
true, perfect and perpetual Continency and Chastity, vowed and performed by the
blessed Virgin vide Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. 2. part c. 3.. 1. n. 3.
: Nevertheless this Example does not prove the former Position; For though it
be very true, that the blessed Virgin had determined and resolved with her self
faithfully to keep the Vow of Virginity; Yet as the Doctors do testify,
proposuit se servaturam virginitatis votum in Cord, ipsa autem votum non
expressit ore c. Beata Maria. 27. q. 2. post. August. de bono conjugali. Gloss.
in c. sufficiat. 22. q. 2. verb. voti virginalia.
, She purposed to keep the Vow of Virginity in her Heart, but she did not
express this Vow with her Mouth: And so the blessed Virgin did so Vow
Virginity, as therein she did not any thing against the Substance of Matrimony
Covar. tract. de Sponsal. 2. part c. 3.. 1. n. 4.
. Like as on the other side, she did so consent to Matrimony, as she did
nothing contrary to Virginity; Consensit enim, non in actum Copulae, sed in
potentiam, certior divinitus facta Josephum in eodem Castitatis voto
permansurum, nec eam cogniturum Covar. ubi supra. post. Tho. in 4. distinct.
30. q. 2. ar. 1. c. Conjux. 27. q. 2. ex Augustino. de nuptiis and Concupiscen.
c. 11, and 12. unde Gratianus assumpsit, tametsi in L. decretorum tribuatur.
August. in lib. de bono Conjugij. ut refert Covar. ubi supra.
; She consented not unto the Act of Copulation, but unto the power, being
divinely assured that Joseph was to continue in the same Vow of Chastity, and
would not know her. Again in this sacred Marriage betwixt Joseph and Mary,
there were all these three good things above recited, That is to say, bonum
prolis, quia Christus natus; bonum fidei, quia nullum adulterium; vinculum
individuum, quia nullum divortium d. c. omne. 27. q. 2. ex eod. Augustino ubi
supra and gloss. in d.c. omne.
. The good of Issue, because Christ was born; the good of Faithfulness, because
no Adultery; the Bond inseparable, because no Divorce.

32. Secondly, where I affirmed, that this Condition [si adulterand' te
tradideris, If thou will become an Adulteress] destroys the Contract of
Matrimony c. ultim de condic. appos. extra.
, because it is contrary to the second good, for which Matrimony was ordained,
which is bonum fidei Praepos. in d. c. ultim. n. 4. Covar. in tract. de
Sponsal. 2. part c. 3.. 1. n. 1.
, it is objected and affirmed by others, that this Condition is not against the
Substance of Matrimony, (and therefore does not destroy the Contract) unless
this also had been added, that she should deny to pay her due to her Husband
Angel. de Clavas. in Summa. verb. Matrimonium. Imped. 3. n. 11.
; But it is answered, that this faithfulness does not only include the debt of
Marriage, which one of them ought to yield to other; But this also is excluded,
That either of them should yield their Bodies to any other Covar. tract. de
Sponsal. 2. part c. 3.. 1. n. 2. Prier. in Summa Silvestr. verb. Matrimonium.
el. 4. q. 6. post Tho. in 4. distinct. 31. q. 1. ar. 2.
; And therefore not only that Condition is contra bonum fidei, when they indent
not to pay their dues to themselves, but that Condition also of committing
filthiness with any other Covar. ubi supra. Licet magis fortasse sit contra
bonum fidei, negare debitum conjugale quam alteri commisceri, quemadmodum and

susceptam, at illud principalius secundum. Silvestr. verb. Matrimonium. cl. 4.
q. 6.
.

33. Thirdly, where I affirmed that this Condition, [Donec inveniam meliorem,
until I find a better] does make void the Contract Text. in c. ultim. prima
part de cond. appos. extra.
, because it is against the third good of Matrimony, id est, vinculum
individuum Gloss. and DD. eod. c. ultim. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. Secunda
part. c. 3.. 1. n. 1. in fin. est enim inseparabilitas essentialis Matrimonij.
Test Silvestr. Prier. verb. Matrimonium sect;. 4. q. 5.
, the inseparable band: It may be objected that this Contract is not
Conditional, but Modal, by reason of this word [Donec Zas. in L. centesimus.
fin. ff. de verb. ob. n. 8, and 9. ubi refert se in consilio quodam salvasse
mulierem, quod non administraret sub Condition, sed sub modo, facta
dispositione quod libere administret bona relicta, donec permanserit vidua.
, until]; and therefore the contract is to take place, and so to continue,
[donec, until], that accident come to pass L. legatum ff. de annuis leg.
Praepos. in c. verum. de Condic. appos. extra. n. 1. and 9.
; which because it can never happen (for that the exchange of Wives and
Husbands was and is perpetually unlawful Genes. c. 2. verse. 24. Math. c. 19.
verse. 6. DD. in d.c. ultim. de cond. appos. extra.
; therefore is the Contract to continue for ever Imo rejicitur modus contra
substantiam actus, censetur quod actus omnino validus L. cum precario. ff. de
precar. and in c. ultim. de precar.
: Nor is it strange that this word [Donec] should signify a perpetuity of
time, if we will listen unto the Divines, upon these and the like Cases [Donec
ponam inimicos tuos Scabellum pedum tuorum Psalm. 109. 1.2. Epist. ad Heb. c.
1.13. d. Hieron. contra. Jovinianum. lib. 1. circa. prin.
, until I make thine Enemies thy Footstool; Donec peperit primogenitum filium,
until she brought forth her first begotten Son, etc.] Matthew. c. 1. in fin.
Hyeron. ubi supra. Zas. in L. contissimus.. ultim. n. 10. ff. de verb. oblig.
Moreover suppose the Contract were not Modal, but Conditional L. pater
severinam.. ultim. ff. de cond. and demon. Bart. in L. 1. eod. Tit.
, the differences whereof I have deciphered in my Treatise of Testaments fol.
137. n. 5.
; Yet may it be objected, forasmuch as this Condition is not suspensive, but
resolutive or extinctive Praepos. in c. ultim. de cond. appos. extra. n. 3.
Paul. de Castr. in L. sufficit ff. de Cond. in deb. n. 5. and ibi Jas. n. 5,
and 6.
, that is to say, not hindering the nativity or birth of the Bond or
Obligation, but threatening a death or destruction to that which is born Paul.
de Castr. ubi supra. Cardinal. in c. verum. de Condic. app. extra. Bar. in L.
1. ff. de cond. and demon. n. 15. Tiraquel. de retract. Conventional.. 2.

suspendit actum, nec eum facit conditionalem, sed tantum ex eventu eum

; forasmuch also as privatio praesupponit habitum L. december. ff. de verb. oblig.
and l. manumissiones. de justit. and jur. ff.
, as the Logicians teach us Everard. loco a privatione. and Olden. Topic. legal.
, therefore this resolutive or extinctive Condition does presuppose a former
Act; and such an Act as is to continue, [donec, until] the Condition be extant
L. 2. ff. de in diem addict. cum gloss. Paul. and Jas. in d. L. sufficit.
Tiraquel. de Retract. conventionel. fol. 347. n. 74. Dec. and Cagnol. in L. is
damnum.. quod pendet. de Reg. Jur. ff.
, which if it never happen, then remains the Contract ever firm and good L.
1. and 2. de in diem addic. ff. and ibi gloss.
: So that whether the Contract be Modal or Conditional, it still returns to
this end, that it is not a void Contract per ea quae superius tradita ^^nt,
quibus add Panor. in. c. 1. de cond. app. extra. n. 2. ubi Post. Antho. dicit,
quod si contraho Matrimonium tecum, and si non donaveris mihi Centum, volo te
reliquere; Centum nunquam datis, Matrimonium, quod a principio tenuit, non
potest dissolvi.
. To both these Objections one answer might suffice, namely, That whether we
imagine the Contract to be Modal or Conditional it is not material; for as
Conditio does destroy the Contract when it is against the Substance of
Matrimony, (as is before confirmed), even so does Modus; So writes Silvester
Prierius Prisc. in sua summa verb. Matrimonium.. 3. n. 12. Accedit Covar.
tract. de Sponsal. Secunda part c. 3.. 1. n. 8.
, in these Terms. Idem de Modo dicendum, quod de Condition, and secundum
eandem distinctionem; Nam si est contra jus Matrimonij, and apponitur in ipso
Cantractu, vitiat Contractum, etc. The same thing is to be spoken of the Mean,
which is spoken of the Condition, and according to the same distinction; for it
be against the Law of Matrimony, and be put in the Contract it self, it
destroys the Contract; To whom I may join Covaruvias writing thus; Non tantum
per Conditionem contra Substantiam Matrimonij vitiatur ipse Contractus, Sed
etiam per Modum Contractus adjectum; Not only by a Condition against the
Substance of Matrimony, is the Contract destroyed, but also by a Mean adjoining
to the Contract Covar. tract. de Sponsal. secunda part c. 3.. 1. n. 7.
: But to answer to either Objection severally; where it is said, that the
Contract which is made Sub modo, is forthwith to take effect; and so to
continue until that quality be extant L. legatum. de an. leg. ff. Zas. in l.
centesimus.. ultim. de verb. ob. ff. n. 8, and 9. Addic. ad Summam Hostiens. in
Rub. de condic. appos.. quae conditio in fin.
: That is not true in case this Modus, wherewith the Contract is interrupted,
be against the Substance of the Act Prier. verb. Matrimonium.. 3. q. 12. c.
ultim. de cond. app. extra. Covar. tract. de Sponsal. 2. part. c. 3.. 1. n. 8.
; Indeed if a Man and a Woman contract Matrimony Sub modo, which is not against
the Substance of Matrimony, nor unhonest, nor unlawful, [ As that he shall give
her 100 l. at such a day], though he do not give her the Sum promised at the
time appointed, yet is not the Matrimony dissolved Prier. ubi supra. Summa

; but it is otherwise in other Contracts L. 1. and 2. ff. de addict. in diem.
; and in testamentary dispositions L. pater Severinam.. ultim. ff. de cond. and
demon.
, from whence these objected Arguments being deduced, prove nothing against our
former assertion Ex separapis non infertur. L. uitim. ff. de Calum. L. neque
natales C. de probac. Everard. loco a separatis.
: And whereas it is further objected, that this Condition being resolutive,
does presuppose a former Act Paui. de Castr. and Jas. in L. sufficit ff. de
cond. indeb. Praepos. in c. ultim. de condic. app. extra. n 3.
, like as privatio praesuppoint habitum L. december. ff. de verb. oblig. Everard.
loco a privatione.
. I answer that a Condition resolutive (properly so called) does presuppose a
former Act DD. in L. pecuniam quam. ff. si cer. pet. Tiraquel. de retract.
Novel. fol. 343. n. 74. Panor. in c. ultim. de cond. appos. extra.
, in which Case the Contract is said to be, purus in Capite, conditionalis in
Cauda DD. in L. centessimus. ultim. praesertim. Zas. de verb. oblig. ff.
, pure or simple in the Head, conditional in the Tail: But in our Case the
Condition is not properly resolutive; and therefore does not work any such
Supposals, which thing appears by Panormitan in these words, Notabis, Quod
Conditio contra Substantiam Matrimonii Contractum impedit, non solum quando est
Suspensiva, sed etiam Resolutiva, licet aliqui (sed male) haec non
animadvertentes putarant quod ex quo semel Matrimonium tenuit, Conditio
resolvens debet haberi pro non adjecta, quod est falsum; Nam dico quod nunquam
fuit Matrimonium, and sic proprie non potest dici Conditio resolutiva Panor. in
c. ultim. de condic. appos. extra. n. 2.
. Thou shall note, that a Condition against the substance of Matrimony does
hinder the Contract, not only when it is Suspensive, but also when it is
Resolutive, although some Men (but wrongfully) not marking it, that since the
Matrimony once held, this resolving Condition ought to be accounted for
rejected, which is false; for I say, that there was never Matrimony, and so the
Condition cannot properly be termed resolutive.

34. To conclude therefore whether the Condition be against the first good of
Matrimony, as [if thou shall avoid generation of Children], or against the
second good [as if thou shall play the Adulteress], or against the third good,
as [ if I shall not find a better, or until I find a better], In every of these
Cases (the former objections notwithstanding) the Contract is utterly void, and
of none effect Textus est apertissimus in c. ultim. de condic. appos. extra.
prima part. Add c. solet. etc. aliquando. 32. q. 2.
, except as follows after the Ampliations of this Rule, which Ampliations are
these.

35. The first Ampliation is collected out of the last Objection, that is,
whether the Condition be suspensive or resolutive; yet resisting the Substance
of Matrimony, it overthrows the Contract c. ultim. de condic. appos. extra.
and ibi. DD.
.

36. The second Ampliation flowing from the same Fountain is this; Whether the
Contract be conditional or modal, yet being against the Substance of Matrimony
it is utterly void and frustrate Covar. Tract. de Sponfal. secunda part, c.
3.. 1. n. 7. Silvestr. verb. Matrimo. nium.. 3. q. 12.
.

37. The third Ampliation is, That albeit the Parties thus contracted should
know each other Carnally, yet should the Contract still remain destitute of
legal force and virtue Henr. Boic. and Panor. in c. ultim. de Sponsal. extra.
Covar. de Sponsal. secunda part, cap. 3.. 1. nu. 12. and 16.
.

38. The fourth Ampliation is, That albeit the Resolutive Condition be neither
unhonest or unreasonable; yet fighting with the Substance of the Act, it does
mortally wound the Contract without hope of recovery Hyppol. de Marsil.
Singular. 286. Panor. and Covar. ubi supra. Bombin. consil. 35. Aretin. consil.
82.
. For Example; A Man contracteth Matrimony with a Woman conditionally [ If she
shall live honestly, or If she do never commit Adultery,] whereunto the Woman
expressly gives her Consent. In this Case, howsoever this Resolutive Condition
seem very honest and very reasonable, yet because it does so mightily fight
with the perpetuity or third good of Matrimony, which is individuum vinculum,
by the received Judgment of all the Interpreters (almost) of the Laws
Ecclesiastical, the Contract is dead in Law Panor. Hyppol. Bombin. and Aretin.
ubi supra. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda. part, c. 3.. 1. n. 10. Cardinal.

deal together, yet could not this Conjunction preserve the life, or give any
strength to the aforesaid Contract Panor. and DD. in c. ultim. de cond. appos.
extra. Hyppol. Singul. 286.
. This verily is the Judgment of most Writers in this Case, which also they
have generally delivered for a singular and memorable Cautele, whereby any Man
(if peradventure he were urged to contract Matrimony with any Woman against his
liking) might not only seem to contract Matrimony with her, but also indeed lie
with her, and yet nevertheless be at freedom, and disappoint them of their
purpose, who urged him against his Will Hyppol. d. Singul. 286. fatetur se hanc
Cautelam primum ab Anto. de Burges Hispano didicisse, quam etiam plaribus

probandus, sed tum demum, quum quis opprimitur injuria, inquit Covar. Tract. de
Sponsal. secunda part, c. 3.. 1. 16.
. And one Petrus Gerardus de Petra Sancta, does confirm it with a pretty
History to this effect Gerard. Singular. 21.
: Whiles Gerardus was Student at Bononia, a fresh Scholar there, a tall and
straight Stripling, of a Sanguine Complexion, springing toward the Age of
Twenty years, whose Parentage was neither base nor poor, having more delight to
be abroad in the City, than to be shut up within a solitary Study, more
desirous to behold the fair Faces of beautiful Virgins, than to pore upon an
unpleasant Book, or to be acquainted with such as Bartolus and Baldus, and
carrying a greater Zeal to examine and try the sharpness of Women's wits, with
some pleasant parley, than to be urged with subtle Arguments, or opposed with
serious Disputations in the Schools: And finally, esteeming it in those days
(which none does in these days, neither in Oxford nor Cambridge, nor in the
Inns of Courts) a far greater blessedness secretly to kiss the Civil Text of
Women's Lips, than publicly to frequent the Solemn Lectures of Profound
Doctors, interpreting whatsoever Text either Civil or Divine: This gallant
Youth, whose Purse was as well furnished with Tempting Angels, as his Head
fraught with pleasant Conceits, often recreating his unwearied Wits, and daily
refreshing his untired Senses, after he had taken a diligent Survey of all the
whole Army of the amiable Amazons of Bononia, espied one Virgin amongst others,
whose excellent Beauty, fine Complexion, courteous Conditions, womanly Modesty,
seemly Grace, and other Virtues of Body and Mind, were such, as for the same
she was worthily preferred before the rest, albeit they in respect of Wealth,
Honor and Friendship, were to be preferred before her (so adverse is Fortune
to Nature;) Well notes this Scholar all her Perfections of Nature, and all her
wants of Fortune; by the one he is inflamed to Love, by the other he is in hope
to speed: Forward therefore he proceeds, sparing neither Vows nor Gifts,
whether to obtain Marriage, or but to reap the only Fruits thereof, let the
Sequel show; but whether this or that it skilleth not; for so persuasive was
his Eloquence, as the simple Maid mistrusted not, and of such force were his
Gifts, as the poor Soul misliked not: Nevertheless, lest she might seem too
credulous to believe all that he spoke, or too amorous to grant all that he
desired; to prevent the one, she tried her womanly wit with his Scholarly
skill, opposing to his fair Promises many grievous Perils; and to avoid the
other, she showed no want of maidenly modesty, by often denying his earnest
Demands, preferring that one Jewel, which he so desired, before all the Jewels
which he had bestowed: In no wise therefore would she yield, and yet would she
be conquered in any wise: He perceives and pursues, attending only for
opportunity: During which time, her aged and long experienced Parents,
understanding the rash Resolutions of the young Couple, did see, but would not
see the same, intending indeed by this Bait of their Daughters Beauty to catch
the Youth in his own Net, and to force him to marry her, and maintain them.
They therefore make fair weather, inviting him to their House very friendly,
and there entertaining him very civilly. And long it was not, till by the
subtilty of the expert Parents, an opportunity was offered to these fervent
Lovers, to have accomplished what they long desired. The Scholar thought verily
that now he had got Fortune by the Forehead. But when they were alone, and safe
together (as they thought) suddenly her vigilant Parents, with a multitude of
Kinsfolks, rush upon them, threatening even to kill the Scholar, unless he would
presently marry their Daughter. Judge you in what a quandary my young Master
now stood, seeing himself thus entrapped, and brought to this Dilemma, either
to marry a Woman of poor and base Kindred, or else to hazard the loss of his
own life. In vain does he now wish, that he had been fast at his Book; In vain
does he now repent him, that he preferred Pleasure before Study; and in vain
did he often and earnestly crave a further time to answer; but they were
peremptory: Wherefore seeing no other Remedy, he willed them to send for a
Notary, promising that before his departure he would contract Matrimony with
their Daughter, which pacified them for the time; and in the mean time, with
all speed, he dispatched a secret Messenger to an old Doctor his Tutor, to whom
the Case being imparted, he craveth his Counsel, in making such a Contract as
might satisfy the Parents, but not bind himself. The Tutor advises his Pupil
to contract Matrimony conditionally, [If she shall live honestly,] or [If she
shall not do with another as she she had done with him,] or under some like
Resolutive Condition. The Scholar upon the return of the Messenger, and the
receipt of this Answer, he was advertised; wherewith, not only the Party
herself, but the Parents also were well appaied, thinking the Condition to be
both reasonable and lawful. Which done, the Scholar escaped joyfully, thanked
his Tutor heartily, and thence forward applied his Study more diligently. The
covetous Parents, who thought they had been sure of a rich Son in Law, after
they had consulted with others, perceived that they were deceived. The young
Woman, who lately was a Virgin, remained very sorrowful, not so much for the
loss of that which could not be recovered, as for the loss of her new supposed
Husband. Thus whether we respect Histories or Authorities, we may perceive how
all the Interpreters, with one common Consent, conspire in this, That albeit
the Condition do seem reasonable and honest, yet being Resolutive, it does
utterly destroy the Contract of Matrimony wherewith it is mixed. Only one
Writer Melchior. Kling. Tract. de causis matrimonial, fol. 75.
(of all that I have read) does run a contrary Course, affirming that this
Condition [Si honest vixeris, If thou shall live honestly; Si non maechaberis,
If thou will not commit Adultery] is a secret Condition, such as, were it not
expressed, is secretly understood, and therefore that the Contract is not
thereby made Conditional, but that the same is pure and simple, as if no such
Condition had ever been expressed Arg. l. Conditiones extrinsecus. ff. de cond.
and demon L. non recte. C. de side juss.
. Howbeit, I do not see how it may be justified, that these be secret
Conditions: For albeit to live honestly, and not to commit Adultery, be one of
the ends for which Matrimony was instituted, and so always understood and
secretly promised, though it were not expressed in the Matrimonial Contract c.
nuptiarum. 27. q. 1. c. omne. 27. q. 2. Praepos. in c. ultim. de cond. appos.
extra. n. 3. Silva nuptialis, fol. (mihi) 135. nu. 9.
, yet that this formal Promise is understood as a Condition, (that is to say)
that if either party should live unhonestly by committing Adultery, the
Matrimony were thereupon ipso facto dissolved Nam deficiente Condition, ipso
jure corruit dispositio, tam inter vivos quam in ultimis voluntatibus. Tiraquel

, (for such is the nature of a Condition) does not follow Topicus namque locus
a fine, tenet solum in bono and malo, inquit Jo. Casus Oxon. in sua Summa
dialect. fol. 239.
: Of which Question nevertheless, and whether for Adultery Matrimony be
dissolved a vinculo, or only a mensa and thoro, we shall hereafter discourse
more fully: But in the mean time, I dare not trust to this one Man's opinion
alone, especially against so many. Again, if it were granted, That this
Condition [Si honest vixeris, If thou shall live honestly,] is tacita
Conditio, a secret Condition, Does it therefore follow that the Contract
wherein this secret Condition is expressed, is pure and simple, as if it had
not been expressed Nec ipso Jure dissolvi Matrimonium propter Adulterium sed
expectandum esse Ecclesiae Judicium, etiamsi Crimen sit notorium, Communis est
Doctorum opinio. in c. porro. de divortiis extra. Moraldus Tract. de
Matrimonio, fol. 98. qui tum aliter sentit, si Causa sit notoria. Gloss. in c.

; Is not that also very doubtful? I refer thee to that I have written of the
Nature of secret Conditions supra. eod..
. Indeed Spousals de futuro may be contracted under this resolutive Condition,
[ If thou shall live honestly, etc. Et ita fortasse voluit ipse Melchior.

], because it is certain that such Spousals may be dissolved for Fornication,
albeit the Contract were pure and simple, without mention of the former
Condition c. quemadmodum, de Jure jur. extra.. Ita si quis.
; much more when this Condition [ If thou shall live honestly, If thou shall
not commit Adultery c. de illis. de condic. appos. extra.
] is expressed, unless the Parties so espoused do first know each other
Carnally, for then it is all one as if they had simply contracted Matrimony d.

: Moreover, if the Matrimony were separable even a vinculo in Case of Adultery
(as some do hold de quibus Schneidwin. Tract. de nuptiis. ^l. 50. cum seq.

; nay, the Innocent may not only so do, but is severely to be admonished
thereunto Schneidwin. ubi supra. vide infra.
: Wherefore this Condition [ If thou shall live honestly, or If thou shall not
commit Adultery,] is not a secret Condition, such as is necessarily understood
in every Matrimonial Contract (inasmuch as Matrimony may consist, and not be
dissolved, the Condition being infringed) but rather a Condition against the
Substance of Matrimony, (inasmuch as it is opposite to the perpetuity of
Marriage) and therefore does overthrow the Contract of Matrimony whereunto it
is joined, accordingly as is aforesaid Panor. in c. ultim. de condic. appos.
extra. Gerard. Sing. 21. Hyppol. Sing. 286.
.

39. The first Limitation of the former Rule (viz.) That a Condition against
the Substance of Matrimony does make void the Contract c. ultim. de condic.
appos. extra.
,) is when the other Party does directly dissent or gainsay the same
Condition, consenting only to the Contract without the Condition 32. q. 2. c.
aliquando. Innoc. Henr. Boic. and alii in c. ultim. de cond. appos. extra.
; for in this Case the Contract is good, and shall prevail as Spousals

n. 11. quam and ipse ibidem confirmat adversus Adr. in 4. q. 9.
, which by Carnal Copulation become true and perfect Matrimony iid. ubi infra.
.

40. The second Limitation is when the other Party does neither expressly
dissent nor consent to the said Condition (yielding Consent to the Contract
only); for unless both the Parties do yield to the Condition the Contract is
not utterly overthrown: So that the Silence of the one Party does work the same
effect in this Case, which manifest Contradiction did in the former Inno. Boic.
Hostiens. Cardinal. and Praepos. in c. ultim. de cond. appos. extra.
.

41. The third Limitation is when as the Parties do first Contract Matrimony,
and then the Contract being perfect, add a Condition against the Substance of
the Act; for then, albeit both Parties do expressly give their mutual Consents
to this Condition, yet does it not hurt the former perfect Contract Praepos. in

42. Unhonest Conditions, which be not against the Substance of Matrimony, do
not hinder the validity of the Contract of Spousals or Matrimony, whereunto
they be joined c. ultim. de cond. appos. extra. secunda part. Praepos. in c.

ultim. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 3.. 1. n. 1. and 2.
, for it is otherwise in other Contracts by the Civil Law L. impossibilis ff.
de verb. oblig.. Si impossibilis. Instit. de mutil. sti. pull.
; and therefore if a Man and a Woman do contract Spousals or Matrimony
together, conditionally if he or she shall commit Theft or Murder, this
Condition is rejected, and the Contract pure and simple Summa Hostiens. in Rub.
de condic. appos.. quae conditio. Melchior. Kling. Tract. de cause. Matrim. fol.
76. Covar. tract. de despons. secunda part c. 3. 2. in prin. per d. c. fin. de
cond. app. extra.
; Nevertheless, it is not perpetually true that the unhonest Condition is
rejected in Matrimonial Contracts; for if the Parties do believe the same
condition to be honest Covar. Tract. de cause. Matrimonial. secunda part. c.
3.. 2. n. 16.
, or if the unhonest Condition be only of a thing past or present, and not
future Idem Covar. d.. 2. n. 2.
; or when the Parties do expressly covenant not to consent, unless that unhonest
Condition be accomplished Hadrian. in 4. de Matrimonio. q. 6. and Covar. d.. 2.
n. 5.
, in these Cases the Condition is not rejected, but makes void the Contract.

43. What if a Man contract Matrimony or Spousals with a Woman conditionally,
If she shall suffer him to have the use of her Body carnally, or to beget her
with Child, Whether is this Contract pure and simple or conditional De hac L.
vide gloss. and Doctores in c. 1. de Spons. duorum. extra.
? Diverse hold, that whether the Parties do mean of unhonest and adulterous
Copulation, or of Matrimonial Conjunction, the Contract is still pure and
simple Gloss. in c. 1. de Spons. duorum extra. verb. si Permiserit. in princ.
: In the former Case it is pure and simple (say they), because unhonest
Conditions are rejected from the Contract, when they be not against the
Substance thereof Gloss. in d. c. 1. per. c. ultim. de condic. appos. extra.
Boer. consil. 40. n. 128. Panor. in d. c. 1. n. 6.
; and in the second Case much more is the Contract pure and simple, because
Matrimonial Copulation is a secret Condition necessarily understood Gloss.
praeall. and Praepos. in d. c. 1. de Spons. duorum n. 4.
; and to that end especially is Matrimony contracted. cum ergo. 27. q. 2.

: But if they did not mean of any unlawful Conjunction, then is the Contract
conditional, and is suspended until the Condition be accomplished Cardinal. in

7. verse. Si vero sit honesta. Contrarium tamen tenet Praepos. in d. c. 1. n. 4.
Ubi dicit hanc Conditionem nihil operari quia non aliter exprimitur quam inest.
. If it do not appear whether the Parties did mean of a lawful or unlawful
Conjunction, for the avoiding of Sin the Law presumes they meant honestly
Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part. c. 3.. 2. in fin. Praepos. in c. 1. de
Spons.duorum. n. 5. verb. In contrariam.
; whereby the Contract is made conditional, and is suspended (as is aforesaid)
until the Condition be performed Cardinal. in c. 1. de Spons. duorum. op.
secunda. in fin. Prier. verb. Matrimonium. 3. q. 7.
, which Condition being once performed, it is a question whether these Spousals
remain Spousals, or they do pass from Spousals into Matrimony de qua q. DD. in
c. 1. de Spons. duorum extra.
; Wherein some affirm that they be no more than Spousals still Vincen. in d. c.
1. de Spons. duorem extra. and post eum Jo. And. ibidem Silvestr. Prier. verb.
Matrimonium. 3. q. 7. versic. Si vero sit: honesta.
: And although the Condition be now accomplished, whereby the Spousals, which
before such accomplishment were conditional, are now purified, and as it were
without Condition c. de illis. etc. super co. de cond. appos. extra. and ibi
DD. and in c. fraternitatis. de frigid. and malefic.
; Yet this removing of the Condition has no further force, save only to make
that simple, which before was conditional: So that whereas these Spousals were
at first conditional, the Condition being removed, they become of Conditional
Spousals, simple Spousals d. c. de if lis.
, but yet Spousals still, not Matrimony Unicen. and Jo. And. in d.c. 1. de
Spons. duorum.
. Like as when two Parties contract Spousals conditionally, by promising that
they will Marry together, if their Parents shall consent Contrahunt. namque sub
condition sponsalia, etiam de futuro c. de illis de cond. appos. and ibi
Panor. n. 2.
, the Parties consenting, it is no more than if they had promised simply to
Marry Panor. in. d. c. de illis.
, which promise of future Marriage (albeit simple and without Condition), does
import no more but Spousals L 1. de Sponsal. ff.
: Nevertheless it is confessed by the Authors of this Opinion, that if the
Parties contracting Spousals conditionally, [If she shall suffer him to have
the use of her Body] proceed to the second Act of Generation, then, as by the
first Act the conditional Spousals are made simple, so by the second Act, these
simple Spousals are translated into Matrimony Unicen. Jo. And. and alii in c.
1. de Spons. duorum. Henr. Boic. in c. ultim. de cond. appos. in fin.
; Others (whose Opinion is more commonly received) do affirm, that even by the
perfection of the first Act of generation, the foresaid Spousals are not only
purified from the foresaid Condition, but are also turned into Matrimony
Praepos. in c. 1. de Spons. duorum extra. n. 5. verb. in contrarium. Covar.

5. versic. Quod si quis contraxit, etc. Melch. Kling. Tract. de cause.
Matrimanial. fol. 75. in fin.
. Whose reason is, that forasmuch as the Parties did mean of an honest and
lawful Copulation, they did thereby intend a Matrimonial Consummation; and
consequently by the accomplishment of that intended Condition, the aforesaid
Spousals became Matrimony Covar. tract. de Sponsal. secunda part. c. 3.. 2. in
fin. Cardin. in c. 1. de Spons. duorum. Summa Rosella ubi supra.
, none otherwise than when two Parties contracting Spousals conditionally, viz.
That they will Marry, if their Parents will consent; and dealing together
Carnally before the accomplishment of the Condition, are not only said to have
thereby renounced the Condition, but also in the same moment to have translated
the same Spousals into Matrimony DD. and praesertim. Panor. and Praepos. in c.
de illis de cond. appos. extra.
; And so I take it to be, when as the Parties do contract Spousals in this
form, [If thou will permit me to have the use of thy Body, I will Marry thee,
if ever I Marry Summa Angel. verb. Motrimonium. impediment. 3. n. 9. Addic. ad
Hostiens. Summa. in Rub. de condic. appos.. quae conditio. in fin. Summa
Rosell. verb. Matrimonium. el. 5. versic. quid si quis contrahat. in fin.
], that is to say, if the Parties meant unhonestly the Condition is rejected,
if honestly the Contract is suspended, but the Condition being once
accomplished, the Spousals are not only purified, but turned into Matrimony
ibidem.
. But if the Contract be made in this wise If thou will suffer me, I will never
forsake thee] albeit she do suffer him, yet thereby neither Matrimony, neither
Spousals are contracted or confirmed Baptista in Summa Rosella. verb.

2. q. 13. facit. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. c. 4.. 1. n. 3. in fin.
; for albeit the Condition being accomplished, the Contract seems to be
purified, or as though no Condition had been expressed c. de illis. etc. super
eo. de condic. appos. extra. and DD. ibidem.
; Yet this admitted, it relieveth not, because these words [I will never
forsake thee], being uttered simply, or without any Condition, infer neither
Matrimony nor Spousals Baptista and Silvester. post. Monald. ubi supra.
, because they be mere negative; And therefore, unles it may appear by some
other Conjectures, that the Parties did thereby intend to contract Matrimony or
Spousals, it is as if the Parties had not spoken any words at all Iidem ibidem,
quibus add Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. 2. part c. 4.. 1. n. 7.
; Or if the Contract be conceived alternatively in these Terms [ If thou shall
suffer me, etc. I will take thee to my Wife, or I will give thee 100 l. Summa
Rosella, and Summa Silvestrin. ubi supra.
] though she do suffer him, yet is it in his Choice (by the received Opinion)
whether he will Marry her, or give her 100 l. Silvestr. Prier. verb.

44. What shall we say to this Condition, [Si te Virginem invenero, Si in primo

when I first deal with thee?]

45. Some hold that this is an unhonest Condition, and therefore rejected
Innoc. in c. de illis. de cond. appos. extra. post gloss. ibidem.
, and consequently that the Contract is pure and simple, Whether she be a Maid,
or not a Maid; or whether she please or displease at the Trial Hostiens. in

unhonest, and therefore not rejected, but suspendeth the Contract until the Act
be completed, whereby it may appear whether she be a Maid or no Henr. Boic. in
c. si Conditiones. de condic. appos. extra. versus fin.
; and then if it appear that she be a Maid the Contract is good, but if she
appear to be no Maid, the Contract is void Henr. Boic. ubi supra. and Melchior

otherwise would ensue, the Law will charge him to entertain her as his Wife

Understanding of these words, [ If I shall find thee a Virgin, etc. Cardinal.
and Praepos. in c. per tuas de condic. appos. extra. Summa Angel. verb.
matrimonium. Impediment. 3. n. 7.
] for she may be found a Virgin by honest means, that is to say, by the view
and inspection of her Body by honest Matrons. The words therefore being taken
in this Sense, that is to say, [If I shall find thee a Virgin by the view of
honest and skilful Matrons] the Condition is honest, suspending the Contract
until the event of the Condition Cardinal. and Praepos. in d. c. per tuas.

purified, and the Contract made pure and simple Cardinal. and Praepos. ubi

; or else does not that Party, which first spoke the words of the Contract,
persevere and continue still in the same mind, until the other Party likewise
yield express Consent, but does repent in the mean time, and then is not the
Contract of any force at all Anto. Quetta. d. consil. 13. n. 7. Henr. Boic. ubi

; yet is it more than necessary that both their Consents concur together at one
and the same instant c. si inter. de Sponsal. extra. ibi mutuo. and Praepos. in

, which thing also the propriety of the word Consent does import; for
[Consensus] is as much as [ simul Sensus Dominicus. de S. Gem. in c. si oblato.
de litis contest. in Sext. Spiegel. lexic. verb. consentire.
,] an agreeing together at one time, without which Consent or mutual Agreement
at one and the same Instant, certainly neither Matrimony nor Spousals can
consist c. Tuae, etc. si inter de Spons. extra. L. nuptias ff. de Reg. Jur. de
consil. 13. n. 7.
.

3. But now having crept out of one Question, we slip into another no less
doubtful, nor no less needful to be known than the former; for what if it do
not appear by any outward Act, whether the Party, whose Consent was first
expressed, do persevere in the same mind or not, whether shall this Party be
presumed still to continue thus aminded, until the other Party likewise
signify his or her mind, yea or no de hac q.^ Zasius. consil. 4. and 5. vol. 2.
? Here again is hard holding and drawing amongst the Doctors DD. in L. 1.. qui
praesens. ff. de verb. oblig.
; for some tell us that he is presumed Dominic. in c. 2. de Lit. cont. in Sext.
Ferretus consil. 246. n. 6. Zasius consil. 5. vol. 2. n. 7. verse. Sed nunc
habeo, etc. Menoch. de praesump. lib. 6. concl. 37. lib. 2. consil. matr.
consil. ibidem 13. n. 7. in fin.
to persevere in the same mind still, when the contrary does not appear; others
teach the contrary Praepos. in c. si inter. de Sponsal. extra. notab. 1. Anto.
Gubert. cujus Consilium extat in lib. 1. consil. matrimonial. consil. ibidem
83. n. 16. lib. 2. cons. matr. consil. ibidem 7. n. 14. Zas. consil. 4. vol. 2.
n. 8.
.

4. The Reasons of the Affirmative are chiefly these, Mutatio non praesumitur
L. eum qui ff. de probat. c. majores. de Baptist. extra.
, inconstantia reprobatur Menoch. de praesump. lib. 6. praesump. 37.
, Change or Alteration is not presumed, Inconstancy is reproved; which Rule is
beautified with many Cases and Examples Menoch. ubi supra. Mascard. de
probatconcl. 1082. and concl. 14, 15.
, which because they be not so pertinent to our purpose, I omit. Again, thus
speaks the Text; Si praesens interrogavit, and antequam responderetur
discessit, and reverso responsum est, obligat L. 1.. qui praesens. ff. de verb.
oblig.
; If one present do interrogate and depart before answer, and returning, being
answered, it binds.

5. The Reasons of the Negative are these: To persevere is to do L. quicquid
iracundiae calore. ff. de Reg. Jur. L. diffamari. si igitur C. de ingen.
manumiss. L. divortium. ff. de divor. and repud.
; now this is a common Rule, Facta non praesumuntur nisi probentur L. in
libello.. facta. ff. de captiv. and posthum. c. Cum Johannes.. verum. de fide
Instrum. extra. Mascard. de probat. conclus. 732.
, Facts are not presumed unless they be proved, and therefore to persevere is
not presumed, when it is not proved. Again, there is a Text which says thus,
Si post interrogationem aliud agere caeperit, nihil proderit quamvis eadem die
spospondisset L. continuus. de verb. oblig. ff.
, If any after he be interrogated begin to do any other thing, it shall not
profit, though he promise the same day; So we see here in this question, here
is Opinion against Opinion, Reason against Reason, and Text against Text.

6. But howsoever Men be contrary in Opinions, neither is reason nor Law
contrary to it self L. cum quidam.. suum. and ibi Bart. de acquir. haered. ff.
; Thus therefore is the Contradiction reconciled, The distance of time betwixt
the promise of the one Party, and of the other is to be regarded, namely
whether it be long or short Zasius. consil. 5. vol. 2. n. 13. quod quidem
consilium fuit Ant. Quettae. ut patet. lib. 2. consil. Matrimonium. consil.
ibidem 13. Idem Zas. consil. 4. vol. 2. at istud consilium est Parisij, id quod
ex illius subscriptione clarum est. n. 34. and invenitur apud eund. Paris. lib.
4. consil. 55.
; if long, then is not the Party, which first promised presumed to persevere in
the same mind until the other Party likewise promise Zas. consil. 5. vol. 2. n.

part. c. 4. in princ. n. 7. DD. in L. 1.. 1. ff. de verb. oblig.
; And therefore (for example) if this day the Man do promise unto the Woman,
that [ he will, or that he does take her to his Wife]; and she make the like
promise to him the next day, this Contract is not good Zas. de consil. 5. n.
14, and 15. lib. 2. cons. matr. consil. ibidem 13. n. 14, 15. Covar. ubi supra.
Paris. consil. 55. vol. 4. n. 14. in fin. Jas. in l. ait praetor. Si neque ff.
n. 3. and 10. and communiter DD. in l. 1.. 1. ff. de verb. ob.
, nor is the Man presumed to persevere so long in the same promise Zas. Jas.
Paris. and Covar. ubi supra. Molin. in d.. qui praesens n. 4. Alciat. ibidem n.
12. and ita exaudiendi sunt Praepos. in c. pen. de Spons. extra. and alij
tenentes, non praesumi perseverantiam con. Dominic. in c. 2. de litis contest.
in Sext. 6. and alios contrarium statuentes.
; For it is agreed upon, and concluded generally amongst all the Writers
almost, of Fame and Estimation, That the space of one day is a long time in
this matter of Contracts, wherein mutual Consent is requisite Bar. in l. 1.. 1.
ff. de verb. ob. ff. n. 1. quem ibi sequuntur communiter DD. nempe Imol. and
Jas. n. 9. and Ripa. n. 15. qui monet ne discedamus ab. op. communi. Zas. d.
cons. 5. n. 14.
; much less then if the Woman promise this day, and the Man next day, is she
presumed to persevere so long, the fragility and mutability of the faeminine
Sex considered Menoch. de praesump. lib. 6. Praes. 37. n. 42. dec. consil. 163.
n. 26. c. forus. de verb. sig. extra.
; In this Case therefore that Rule, Mutatio non praesumitur has no place,
neither that Text, Si praesens interrogavit, etc. Where it is said, if one
present do interrogate and depart before answer; and returning, answer be made,
this is a good Contract; for it follows in the very next Sentence,
Intervallum enim medij temporis modicum non vitiat obligationem L. 1.. qui
praesens. in fin. ff. de verb. ob.
, The distance of the mean time being small, does not destroy the bond. So that
it is evident, that that Text does not speak in our case, where the distance is
great.

7. Nevertheless this Conclusion, that by long distance of time the Continuance
of this mutual Consent is interrupted, and so the Contract void quam
conclusionem, viz. longum intervallum solum, sine alio actu contrario vel
extraneo contractum vitiare communi DD. calculo con. Gloss. and Paul. de
castro, receptam ostendunt Jas. in d.. 1. n. 8. Alciat. ibidem n. 21. Ripa n.
7. quibus accedit Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. n. 7.
, is not free from all Exceptions Vide Ripam in l. 1.. 1. ff. de verb. ob. n.
11. ubi tradita est regula tribus limitationibus illustrata.
: First therefore, if the Parties continue still present without departure from
the place; and without dealing in any other Act, contrary or impertinent to the
matter in hand, the long distance alone does not interrupt, or hinder the
validity of the Contract Paul. de Castro. in d.. qui praesens. verse.
Recoillige, etc. Ripa ibidem. n. 12. ubi hanc limitationem varijs confirmat
medijs. Alciat. quoque codem. n. 24. qui tum in fine labitur.
: As for the purpose, the Man deliberately pronounces the words of the
Contract before the Woman, and asks her, whether she be content to make the
like promise to him. She answers, I will first confer with my Friends, or
with my Counsel; which Conference perhaps continues a whole day, or somewhat
more, the Man still attending her answer Secus enim esset, si discederet and ex
intervallo rediret, quia palam est, actus contumacionem per discessum (nisi
statim revertatur) interrumpi. d.. qui praesens.
; And in the end without any new interrogation, she pronounces the like words
to him as he did to her, This I hold for a good Contract Ripa in d.. qui
praesens. n. 12. post. Castrensem ibidem. Add Molin. eod. loco. d. 9. quorum
opinio eo facilius procedit in Contractu Matrimonali; quo hic alijs

Casu procedit opinio Archid. quem sequitur Dominic. in c. si oblato de lit.
contest. in Sext. Ferretus cons. 446. n. 6.
.

8. Secondly, if a certain time be appointed wherein to deliberate, as if the
Man do promise this day, and the Woman obtains respite for her answer, until
the next day; whereupon the Man departs, and returns at the time appointed;
if then the Woman make the like promise to the Man, not dissenting then, nor
having erst repented of his former promise; I suppose the Contract to be of
like effect, as if there had not been either, distance of time, or departure
from the place Alciat. in L. 1.. qui praes. ff. de verb. ob. n. 24. and Ripa
ibidem n. 11. Imol. in L. Si Stipuler.. fin. de verb. oblig. Alex. consil. 107.

oblig. and Molin. in d.. qui praesens. n. 17. si viz. and quatenus constet de
perseverantia alterius. vide Addic. purpurat. ad Jas. in d. qui praesens.
.

9. Thirdly, If the Party, who first promised, do at the promise of the other
Party, following a long time after, accept the same, and consent thereunto;
then is the Contract good, by reason of this new Consent concurring with the
late answer L. si Stipuler.. Si in locando. ff. de verb. oblig. and ibi Imol.
and DD. Molin. in d.. qui praesens. ff. de verb. oblig. n. 17.
.

10. If the time betwixt the promise of the one Party and of the other, be not
long, that is to say, not above a day Bar. and post cum DD. in l. 1.. 1. de
Verb. oblig.

ex antiquorum Summa, id tempus dicitur, quod a luce est ad tenebras, non
spacium 24. horarum, quamvis Accurs. Paul. de castr. Romans and Jas. diem hunc

contractum viciari, si tamen constat parts in eodem actu gerendo,
perseverasse. Vide Molin. in L. ^1.. qui praesens ff. de Verb. oblig. n. 9.
, then is that Party who first made promise, presumed to continue his Consent,
until the other Party have made the like promise Zas. ubi supra. Covar. Tract.
de Sponsal. 2. part. c. 4. n. 7. Alciat. in l. 1. 5. qui praesens ff. de verb.
oblig. n. 12.
; and so the Contract is of like force, as if they had promised both at once
Ibidem.
.

11. As for the Argument, That facts are not presumed L. in libello.. facto ff.
de captiv. and postlim. c. cum Johannes.. verum. de fide instr. extra.
, but to persevere is a fact L. divortium non est de divor. and repud. L.
quicquid. de Reg. Jur. ff. cum similibus.
; therefore not presumed, it may easily be retorted; for if facts be not
presumed, then mutation being a fact is not presumed Mascard. de probac.
conclus. 1082. Ubi tradit regulam non paucis auctionibus roboratam, quod
mutatio non praesumitur.
; And certainly much more properly is mutation a fact than perseverance, for
perseverance is but the continuation of a former Act Bald. in L. quicunque C.
de ser. fug. n. 23. and in L. quidam col. 9. C. de jure delib.
; Whereas mutation or change, is a new contrary Act L. certi.. fin. L.
singularia ff. si cer. pet.
, and therefore not so easily presumed; and as for the Text, Si post
interrogationem, etc. L. continuus. ff. de verb. ob. ff. in princ.
which says, That if after interrogation, the Party begun to do another Act,
it profits not, though he answer the same day; This Text does not only not
hinder, but further this presumption of perseverance; for in that it is said,
if the Party begun to do another thing, it profits not, if he answer the same
day, etc. we may thereby gather (by an Argument a contrario sensu) that if the
Party do not begin another Act, then it profits if he answer the same day
Vide DD. in d. L. continuus. and in L. 1.. qui praesons. ff. de verb. oblig.
; But does every mean Act between the former, and the second promise interrupt
the continuance of the Parties Consent, and so make void the Contract? The
regular Conclusion is, that it does Hanc regulam constituit Franc. Ripa. in d..
qui praesens. per. d. L. continuus.
, but allows these Limitations.

12. First, when the Act is naturally necessary L. cum antiquitus C. de testam.
Bar. and alii in L. 1.. 1. ff. de verb. oblig.
; and therefore to make Water, or to exonerate the Body, or to Dine or Sup,
does not interrupt the continuance of Consent Ripa. in d.. qui praesens. n. 18.
Molin. n. 19. Alciat. n. 9. qui omnes indistincte sic docent, quamvis non
desunt, qui quoad Prandium vel Caenam differentiam faciunt inter sanum and
aegrotum, quam distinctionem refellit. Ripa. loco praeall.
, especially in so favorable a Case as Matrimony Zas. in l. Si Stipuler.
ultim. n. 7. de verb. oblig. ff.
.

13. Secondly, when the Act is accessory or adhaerent to the principal matter,
as to call for Witnesses, or to confer with their friends, therein it works
no interruption Jas. in d.. qui praesens. in fin. Ripa. n. 17. Molin. n. 9.
.

14. Thirdly, when the Act consists only in words, as to sing a Song of Robin
Hood, albeit it be neither necessary nor pertinent to the Cause, it makes no
breach or interruption Paul. de Castr. and Alex. in d. 3. and ibi. Rip. n. 18.
in fin.
.

15. Fourthly, when the Act is very short and brief, it has not to interrupt
the Consent; as to salute any Person, to read a Letter, to Seal a Process, etc.
Molin. in d.. n. 9. and hoc. quidem verum est in actu modico, non habente
effectum Juris, alias secus, puta cum alio contrahere; advocatum perunam aut
alteram horam agere, Zas and Ripa. ibidem.
].

16. Fifthly, when the Party promising departs forth of the place; and
returns shortly again, here is no interruption, but that the like promise
being made by the other party upon his return, it is as if there had been no
departure Text. in. qui praesens. L. 1. de verb. ob. ff. ibi si vero, etc. nec
reputatur discessus omnino extraneus actus, nisi interveniente longo intervallo
( inquit Castrens. ibidem.)
: What if the Party, having first promised Matrimony, depart forth of the
place, and whiles he is going forth, the other Party makes the like Promise?
For Example; The Man says to the Woman, [Here I take thee to my Wife,] and
then departs from the place; and as he is going, the Woman says to him, [And
here I take thee to my Husband,] Whether is this a good and sure Contract, yea
or no?

17. In respect of diverse Circumstances the Answer may be diverse: If the Man
did not hear the Woman, the Contract is of no more force, than if the Woman had
not spoken at all Paul. de Castr. in L. 1.. qui praesens. ff. de verb. oblig.
and Prier. post eum. Jas. etiam in priac. Alciat. n. 1. Zas. n. 3.
: If the Man did hear the Woman, it is material, whether he departed suddenly
without expectation of her Answer, or not? If so, it is holden that the
Contract is not good, and that this sudden departure, is an Argument that it
repented him of his former Promise Francis. Ripa. in d.. qui praesens. n. 6. in
princ. Alciat. ibidem. n. 1. verse. unde magis placet, etc.
, unless having heard her voice, he did stay to understand her Answer; for this
his stay is an Argument that it did not repent him of his former Answer Ripa.
d. n. 6. versic. Ex quo infertur, etc.
: If otherwise, that is to say, if the Man did not depart immediately after he
had uttered the words of the Contract, but expected her Answer: This slow and
unwilling departure, is an Argument rather of perseverance, than of Repentance;
and therefore the Contract is rather to be adjudged for a good Contract in this
Case Ripa. d. n. 6. Si vero expectato responso, etc.
.

18. Not only such Persons as be present, but those Persons also which are
absent may contract Spousals or Matrimony together L. sufficit and L. fin. de

notice or intelligence the one of the other, at least by Fame or Report Gloss.
in c. nec illud. 30. q. 5. Melchior Kling. Tract. de Sponsal. fol. 2. Dominic.
in c. ultim. de procur. in Sext. n. 2.
; for unto those who be utterly uknown to us, we cannot yield our Consent d.
gloss. and Dominis. ubi supra.
, (without the which it is impossible to contract Matrimony or Spousals) no
more than it is possible for us to love them, of whom we have never heard Phil.

19. When Spousals or Matrimony is to be contracted by a Proctor first of all,
it is needful that the Proxy (or Letter of Attorney) be Special Text. in d. c.
ultim. qui tum loquitur ubi matrimenium contrahitur, sed idem Juris, vel in
Sponsalibus esse, firmant Dom. and Franc. in princ. d. c.
, that is to say, expressing a certain Person, with whom Matrimony or Spousals
are to be contracted Jo. And. Dom. de S. Gem. and Phil. Franc. in d. c. ultim.
; As, [ I make such a Man my Proctor, to contract Matrimony or Spousals for me,
or in my Name with A. B. etc. gloss. in d. c. ultim.
]. Nor is it sufficient if the Proxy be thus, [ I make A. B. my Proctor to
contract Matrimony for me with any Woman,] for the Person must be expressed
certainly, either in the Proxy, or at least by some other means, etc. gloss.
and DD. in d. c. ultim. Summa Angel. verb. matrimonium el. 2. n. 19.
: Neither is it sufficient though Special Clauses be added, the Proxy being
general; as, [ I make A. B. my Proctor or Attorney for all my Business and
Affairs, judicial and extrajudicial, with power and authority to do for me all
and singular whatsoever I my self could do, if I were personally present, etc.
ead. gloss. quam intellige nisi aliquis fortasse Articulus, speciale mandatum
exigens sit expressus, nam tunc mandatum cum bujusmodi-Clausula extenditur ad
alia exigentia speciale mandatum, dum tamen sint consimilia, and non majora
casu expresso. Dominie. in c. qui ad agendum. de procur. in Sext. Ad majora
autem expressi^ non extenditur illa Clausula, cujus tamen Conclusionis
Limitationes aliquot videas apud Felin. in c. Seeds de rescrip. extra. verb.
Clausula. etc. n. 5.
] Neither yet is it sufficient, though the Proxy were sufficient, if it be
revoked in the time of the Contract, albeit also the Party do afterward
ratify and confirm the Contract Molinous in No. intellect. L. sufficit. de
Sponsal. Idem Molin. in Themate consil. Alex. 146. vol. 5.
; but this Conclusion is not to be eaten now, especially of a weak Stomach; for
as it is hard of digestion, so it is likely to breed ill Humors (I mean
erroneous Opinions Vide Ancharan. in c. ratihabitione. de Reg. Jur. lib. 6.
Anto. de Butr. consil. 64. Alex. con. sil. 146. vol. 5. Praepos. in c. 2. de

,) if the Stomach be not prepared, and the thing it self seasoned, and made apt
to be digested: Anon therefore, when thy Stomach is a little stronger, and the
matter riper, thou shall feed on that which now thou have but only a taste of
Infra eod..
.

20. The Proxy being sufficient, the next thing considerable herein is the form
or matter of words to be confidered and observed by the Proctor in contracting
Spousals or Matrimony, wherein some do hold that the Proctor ought not to frame
the words in his own Name, or as Proctor Petr. Anchar. in c. ultim. de procur.
in Sext. n. 2. and 3.
, but in the name of the Party, like a Messenger Petr. Anchar. ubi spura.
; and if he do otherwise, that the Contract is void Anchar. in d. c. ultim. per
l. multum. C. si quis alteri, vel sibi.
: And therefore if he say thus, [I being such a man's Proctor, do here promise
that I will marry thee;] or thus, [Here I take thee to Wife in the Name of such
a man whose Proctor I am,] this is a void Contract Ibidem per d. L. multum.
; whereas if he had said thus, [I being such a man's Proctor, do promise that he
will marry thee;] or thus [Such a man does take thee to his Wife by me being
his Proctor,] this is a good Contract Summa Hostiens. in Rub. de Sponsal..
qualiter. Prier. verb. matrim.. 5. in fin.
, she making the same Answer to him again, viz. [I do promise thee in his Name,
and him by thee, that I will marry him;] or thus [I do take him to my Husband
by thee, being his Proctor;] for in the one Case Spousals, and in the other
Case Matrimony is contracted Hostiens. and Prier. ubi supra. Dom. de S. Gem.
and Phil. Franc. in c. ultim. de procur. in Sext.
. The reason of the difference is this, because where a Proctor, as a Proctor,
does make a Contract with another Person, there by the Civil Law, he which did
constitute the Proctor, has not a direct or immediate Action against that
third Person for the performance of the Contract L. per procur. ff. de procur.
ubi DD. communiter dicunt quod regulariter per procurationem actio non
acquiritur Domino, sine cessione, secus per nuncium L. multum. and ibi Bar. C.
Si quis alteri, vel sibi.
: But otherwise it is when the Contract is made by a Messenger, who comes not
in his own Name, but in his that sent him, being as it were the voice of the
others mind, and the Picture of his Person Phil. Franc. post Jo. And. in c.
ultim. de procur. in Sext. n. 7. vide (praecor.) Bar. in L. qui autem
constituere. ff. de constable. pec.
. Now then, because in a Contract of Matrimony it is requisite, that the one
Party should be bound immediately to the other, and that either of them should
have direct Action against the other Bar. in l. qui bona.. si alieno. ff. de
damno infect. n. 3. per L. fin. ff. de Sponsal.
, it is behoveful (by this former Opinion) that the Proctor frame the words,
not in his own Name, or as Proctor, but in his name who did constitute him, and
as his Messenger Anchar. in d. c. ultim n. 2. and 3. and ibi Franc. n. 7.
.

21. Others nevertheless (whom I rather follow) reject this former Distinction,
as consisting rather upon a Quiddity than Equity, and stuffed with rigor
instead of favor Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part. c. 4. n. 8. Alex.
cons. 149. vol. 5. n. 13. Bar. in L. qui bona.. alieno. ff de dam. infect. n. 3.
; Wherefore it is not material, whether the Contract be formed in these words,
[I do Contract Matrimony with thee in the Name of such a Man, whose Proctor I
am, etc.] or in these words, [Such a Man does contract Matrimony with thee by

contracted Bar. Alex. and Covar. ubi supra.
, although more properly by the later Covar. d.c. 4. secunda part. n. 8. Bar.
in L. qui bona.. si alieno. ff. de dam. infecto.
; for (if we will speak properly) a Proctor thus appointed to contract
Matrimony, is deemed a Messenger rathan a Proctor Procurator quamvis faciat
actum procurateris nomine, tamen censetur gerere officium Nuncij, and perinde
est, ac si Dominus ipse direct faceret, inquit Alex. consil. 149. vol. 5. n.
14.
.

22. Furthermore, It is not only necessary that the Proxy be sufficient, and
that the Contract be made in due form, as aforesaid; but it is requisite also
that the Party which did constitute the Proctor, do persevere and continue in
the same mind and purpose, until the Contract be finished Zas. consil. 5. vol.

, which Conclusion has place, albeit the Proctor were ignorant of the Parties
repentance or revocation of the Proxy d.. sane, licet enim regulariter et
revocatio sortiatur effectum ad procuratoris noticiam pervenire debet, fallit
tamen in hac contrahendi specie, quia ubi verus Domini consensus est adhibendus

Dom. de S. Gem. de Phil. Franc. in d. c. ultim. de procur. in Sext.
, seeing the perseverance and continuance of the Parties Consent, which did
constitute, is so necessary, as without the which the Contract is not of any
force.

23. A third thing worthy the Consideration and Understanding in this Case, is
this, namely, Whether the Party be presumed to persevere and continue in his
former purpose, when it does not otherwise appear by any external Act?

24. Which Question, albeit it may seem to be decided by the distinction of the
great or small distance of time betwixt the constituting the Proctor and the
making the Contract; that is to say, if the distance be small, then
perseverance is presumed, otherwise not Zas. cons. 5. vol. 2. n. 11, 12, 13.
Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part, c. 4. in princ. n. 7.
, accordingly as has been heretofore disputed and discussed; yet that
distinction is available, and to be regarded only where the Parties be present,
and may answer each other within the circuit of one day Covar. ubi supra, sic
ibi loquutus, et haec quidem (inquit) locum habent, ubi praesentes contrahere

, (as is there shown) not where they be absent, and cannot within so short
compass of time (by reason of the long distance of place betwixt the one Party
and the other) express their mutual Consent Zas. d. consil. 5. n. 6. Bal. in L.

; otherwise if neither the Man should be presumed to continue, till the Woman
had notice of his Consent, neither yet the Woman until the Man was certified of
her acceptance of his offer, Impossible it were for such as were absent (above
one days Journey) to contract Matrimony together, because they did never
consent together Hoc ipsum Argumentum ab impossibili deductum sibi ipsi objicit
Zasi. d. consil. 5. n. 6. cui quomodo satisfaciat ipse videto.
; But it is certain that they which are absent and distant many days Journey
asunder, may nevertheless contract lawful Matrimony together Covar. Tract. de

Consent, without the which the Contract were not lawful L. nuptias. ff. de Reg.

this Question in this manner, Quid si nec consentit, nec dissentit, nec de hoc
cogitat qui procuratorem misit, tempore quo puella dissentit? Dicas standum

potestatem, secundum quam etiam inter absentes Sponsalia contrahuntur Hostiens.

. What (says Hostiensis) if he which sent, the Proctor, neither consent nor
dissent, nor think of it, at such time as the young Woman yields her Consent?
say, we are to stand to the Spousals in regard of the favor of Matrimony; and
also in respect of the power of the Law, whereby Spousals may be contracted
betwixt the absent. Another Reason may be collected out of that Text, which
says, That if the Proctor be revoked, the Contract made afterward is void c.
ultim. de procur. in Sent.
, Ergo, if he be not revoked, the Contract is good Arg. 2 contrario Sensu.
; Which nevertheless could not be, presuming defect of Consent Zas. consil. 5.
vol. 2. n. 17.
. Indeed this seems reasonable and agreeable to the truth, that if the Woman
do not immediately or shortly after the Proctor have imparted to her the cause
of his coming, and pronounced the words of Spousals or Matrimony, according to
his Commission, express her mutual Consent thereunto, but a long time after; in
this Case the man's Consent is not presumed to endure so long, if he affirm the
Contrary Zas. d. consil. 5. vol. 2. n. 11. and n. 16. in fin. and 17. in princ.
Paris. consil. 55. vol. 4. n. 14. lib. 2. consil. matr. fol. 111. n. 2. and 3.
; and consequently the Contract void Ibidem.
, unless both the Parties afterward ratify and confirm the same, for then it
is made good by their new Consent Jacob. Henric. in quod. consil. extat. in
lib. 2. consil. ibidem 16. n. 3.
.

25. These things being well considered, we may the better attain to the true
Solution of this hard Question, (whereof I spoke a little before) Whether the
Party having first Secretly revoked his Proctor at the time of the contract of
Spousals or Matrimony, and yet nevertheless afterward ratifying and confirming
the same, the Contract be good, yea or no? Wherein that the truth may appear
more evidently, instead of putting an imagined Case, I thought good to rehearse
that famous and true History, which befell above 200 years past, betwixt the
King of Cyprus, and a noble Lady of Italy, as follows; About the time
aforesaid, there was a noble Man of the most honorable and mighty House and
Dukedom of Millain, who had two Daughters, the praise of whose excellent
Beauties, and Superexcellent Virtues, Dame Fame (who never smothered her
thoughts in Silence) had so mightily magnified in all the Countries
thereabouts, that thereby the two noble Virgins were no less admired for their
goodly and Godly ornaments of Body and Mind, than reverenced for their
honorable Parentage; The name of the Elder Daughter was Agnesia, of the
Younger Catherina, both of them of years marriageable, neither of them without
Store of sundry Suitors; and those so highly renounced for dignity and desert,
as happy was that Man, that could get but a sight of them; yet more happy they,
when they could get a fair look of their Mistresses; but most happy and thrice
blessed he, that could win his sweet Ladies favor, to become his Loyal Wife
(such is the blessed and happy Estate of Virgins, in their prime and
marriageable Years). Well Sir, the most excellent King of Cyprus, after that
his Ears had been filled with the report of both these brave Ladies, and their
rare virtues, especially of the Younger, his heart was by and by inflamed with
hot desire to become an humble Suitor unto her for Marriage; for as he was then
Wifeless, so was he meet to undergo the sacred Match in each respect. Spurred
on therefore on the one side, with a burning desire to obtain his joyful wish;
and the other side, with a freezing fear to be prevented of his wished Joy,
forthwith in all have he dispatcheth an Ambassador with a large Commission, of
many and great assured Offers; and with a special Mandate to contract for him,
and in his Royal Name true, pure and lawful Matrimony with Agnesia, the Noble
Daughter of the mighty Duke of Millain, Supposing her to be the younger Sister,
whom he meant to Marry. To Ship straight goes the joyful Ambassador, and in
very short time attained Italy and Millain, leaving the Island to the King, and
the King to his Muses, who meditating still on the matter, and conferring
diligently with such Persons, by whom he might receive further intelligence
herein; understood at last, that he had mistaken her name, whom he meant to
make his Wife; whereupon presently he revoketh the Mandate, which he had made
of contracting Matrimony with Agnesia: But the faithful Ambassador ignorant
thereof, proceeds effectually in his charge, and therein had so good Success,
as (to be short) he contracteth Matrimony in the Kings Name, with the virtuous
Agnesia; and she thereupon carries her self thence forwards in gravity as a
Wife, (having received the nuptial Ring), and in Majesty as a Queen, being
esteemed and honored of others for no less: Which done, the Ambassador
returns triumphantly to Cyprus, and there makes a just discourse unto the
King, how happily he had sped; but the King was as sad to hear as the other
glad to report the success: Nevertheless after many doubtful deliberations,
considering it did not become the Constancy of a Man, not to perform his
promise, much less the Majesty of a Prince to reclaim his word of Honor,
especially in a matter of such Moment, and with Persons of so great Might, as
one persuaded by force of reason, more than provoked by the instinct of Love;
and foreseeing the dangers likely to ensue his refusal, more than expecting the
future Joys of his acceptance, was rather contented, than pleased with the
Match; and so in the end ratified and confirmed the erroneous and
discomfortable Contract: But when the aforenamed Agnesia heard tell, that it
was not the Kings meaning to have married her at the first, nor yet liked the
Match very well, when it was done; Lord! how she took on without all measure;
how suddenly were all the powers and qualities of her mind altered, and turned
upside down; her highest joys into deepest forrows, her faithful love into
deadly hate, her shineing hope into dark despair, and her pleasant Conceits
into dreadful and tragical Resolutions: And even as the angry Sea, when it is
tossed with the tempestuous blasts of the mighty Winds, does furiously rage,
and terribly roar, disdaining, (as it were) to be controuled by any other
Creature, of whatsoever power or puissance; So Noble Agnesia despiteing that
her Loyal Love should be despised, her Princely Virtues contemned, or her
Honorable Sex disgraced by any Man, though he were an Emperor; fretteth,
chafeth, and exceedingly grieveth at these, so bitter Storms, and violent
blasts of frowning Fortune, and in her raging mood, she teareth the Wedding
Garments from her Back, and plucketh the Nuptial Ring from her Finger, and
violently throws it into the Flaming Fire, swearing and protesting with many
Damnable Execrations, that she will never acknowledge the King of Cyprus for
her Husband, but that she will presently marry another Man; Whereupon her
Father and Friends seeing her resolute mind, took Counsel of the most famous
Lawyers, that were in those days (namely of Antonius de Butrio Butr. consd. 64.
and inter. consil. Anchoran. 129.
, and Petrus de Anchorano Anch. consil. 124. alias 128. sic incipien. A. duas
filias.
), whether she might so do or not; which Grave and Learned Men considering
diligently of the Case, thought it needful to discuss two other questions,
arising out of the Fact, before they did decide the main question proposed. The
one, Whether the Kings Error were in her Person whom he intended to Marry, or
in her Quality Verum non in qualitate sed in Corpore Regem errasse consultum
fuit, ut per Anto. de Butr. and Anchor. ubi supra. and per eundem Anchor. in c.
Ratihabitionem de Reg. Jur. 8. in Sext.
, (as in her Age or Name); But of this question more conveniently elsewhere
Infra.
. The other, Whether the Kings Ratification and Approbation aforesaid, did
fortify and make good the former Contract; which Question before it was
concluded was seriously argued to and fro; and sundry Reasons alleged for the
Confirmation, first of the affirmative, and then of the Negative part.

26. The Reasons of the affirmative, viz. That the Contract was made good, and
whole and sound by the subsequent Ratification, were these. First, because it
is a Notorious Rule, both of the Civil and Canon Law, Ratihabitio retrotrahitur
and mandato comparatur L. semper qui non prohibet ff. de Reg. Jur. c.
ratihabitionem de Reg. Jur. in Sext.
: Which Rule has place even in those Actions, which require a special Mandate
or Proxy Alex. consil. 146. vol. 5. n. 3. Paul. de Castr. in L. multum. C. Si
quis sibi vel al. n. 2. Peckius in d. c. ratihabitionem. n. 9. Dec. in d. l.

cum addic. ibidem in fin. Tiraquel. de Retract.. 1. glo. 10. fol. 94. and
quidem magis communiter tenetur quam ratificatio, dum validat gesta per falsum
procuratorem, etiamsi sit major, and summa pro se lata and Casus talis qui
exigat Speciale Mandatum, ut in Addic. ad Felin. ubi supra.
; Secondly, because it is thus Written by diverse Interpreters, Generale
Mandatum de Nuptijs contrahendis non sufficit nisi Mandatis Ratihabitio
subsequatur Bald. and alij in l. generale ff. de ritu nup.
: A general Mandate to contract Marriage is not sufficient, unless his
Ratification, which made the Mandate, do follow. Thirdly, for that we read this
Conclusion, Nullitas actus, proveniens ex defectu Consensus superveniente
Consensu purgatur, and actus confirmatur Anchor. in c. ratihabitionem de Reg.
Jur. in Sext. col. pen. per c. 1. de despons. impub. lib. 6.
: The nullity of an Act proceeding of the defect of Consent, when the Consent
comes, is purged, and the Act confirmed. Fourthly, whereas by the Civil and
Canon Laws, the Contract of Matrimony is void, where the one Party does err in
the Servile Condition of the other L. cum Ancillis C. de incest. nup. c. 2. de
conjug. servorum. extra.
, (as if the Man suppose the Woman to be a Freewoman, which is found to be a
Bondwoman); Yet nevertheless, if when the Error is detected, he do ratify and
confirm the Contract, then the same is of no less force than if he had not
erred at all d. c. 2.. mandamus de conjug. serve. extra.
.

27. The Reasons which make for the Negative part are these. First, because the
Acts of a revoked Proctor, or Mandatory cannot be ratified Paul de Castr. in L.
Si Tutor. in fin. C. in quib. cause. restitut. non est necess. Jas. in L. licet
C. de procur. n. 10. Limitat. tertia; verum ista Conclusio non procedit

, for one thing cannot be reproved and approved L. dispensatorem. ff. de Solu.
Add Praepos. in c. 2. de conjug. Ser. extra. n. 10. in fin. qui aliam assignat

. Secondly, because the Acts done in the name of a false Messenger, cannot be
ratified Cyn. Bar. and alij in l. multum C. Si quis alteri, vel sibi. Idem Bar.
in l. qui autem.. constituere. ff. de Constitut. pecu. Jas. in L. Licet. C. de
procur. in fin. Atque haec ratio est omnium petentissima, test Molin. in
Themate. consil. Alex. 146. vel. 5.
. Thirdly, because it is not likely that the deceived Woman would have
consented or contracted Matrimony, if she had known that the other Party had
not likewise consented, or that the Proctor had been revoked at the time of the
Contract Praepos. in c. proposuit. de conjug. ser. extra. col. penul. lib. 1.
consil. Matr. consil. ibidem 64. n. 14. Reusner. de Cause. Matrimonial. q. 7. n.
10. and n. 39.
; Which reasons considered, it was concluded, that, forasmuch as before the
time of the Contract, the King had revoked his Proctor, or rather his
Messenger, being then also a false Messenger, by reason of the said Revocation;
and she likewise being then in an Error (than which nothing is more contrary to
Consent) it was concluded (I say) by the aforenamed Anto. de Butrio, and Petrus
de Anchorano, that this Ratification, made by the King of Cyprus, was not of
sufficient force in Law to bind the said Agnesia to be his Wife, and
consequently that she might lawfully marry elsewhere Anto. de Butr. consil. 64.
Anchor. confil. 228. Quibus accedunt Felin. in c. ex part Decani. de rescrip.

c. ultim. de procur. in Sext.. sane n. 4. cum addic. ibidem. and Molin. in
Themate consilij Alex. 146. vol. 5.
. Howbeit, after the death of Anto. de Butrio, Anchoranus (the Question being
publicly disputed in the University of Bononia) is thought to have altered his
Opinion; and that the Ratification did sufficiently confirm, and make good the
Contract Anch. in c. Ratihabitionem de Reg. Jur. in Sext. ubi producit 5
Argumenta ad partem affirmativam; sed mihi videtur quod haec sua disputatio non
fuit completa, intercedente morte seu alio impedimento.
; which Opinion others also have followed in the like Case, especially
Alexander of Imola Consil. 146. vol. 5.
, to whom for his sound Judgment in doubtful Questions of Law, this great
Commendation is given, Alexandro duce vinces de Laudibus Bart. Bald. Paul.
Alex. and Jas. legito Alciat. lib. 2. pererg 42. and Nevizan. Sil. nup. lib. 5.
n. 27.
, as if he were as victorious in his Counsels, as was Alexander of Macedonia in
his Conquests; but as great Alexander, for all his Puissance and Policy, was
sometime forced to retire, so this Alexander, as in other Cases sometimes, even
in this Case, (I trow) must be forced to recant, notwithstanding all his
Learning and profound Judgment, not only by reason of the great multitude of
mighty Adversaries in this quarrel Butr. consil. 64. Anth. ubi contrarius

, amongst whom one M^linaeus challenges the two Captains in this bold manner;
Sed ego dico, quod male scripsit Anchoranus, and pe^us Alexander, quantumvis
artificiose and elaborate Molin. in Themate. confil. Alex. 146. vol. 5.
; But I say, (says Molinaeus) that Anchoranus wrote ill, and Alexander worse,
though skilfully and painfully, but also by reason of the weakness and
feebleness of their own Weapons, that is, their Arguments and Authority Molin.

28. For first, this Rule Ratihabitio retrotrahitur, etc. although it hold even
in those Cases where special Mandates are requisite Dec. and Cagnol. in l.

rather not so much, but only an Organ Pipe (as it were) or hollow Instrument
through which the Master himself does speak Bar. in l. Qui autem.. constituere.
n. 3. ff. de constitut. pecun. Gabr. Sarayna. in addic. ad Romans Singul. 697.
Bald. in L. multum C. si quis alteri vel sibi.
; in which Case, if any pretend himself a Messenger when he is not, his Acts
cannot be ratified to his Masters benefit Rationem assignat Baldus in d. L.
multum. his verbis, Si Nuncio deficiat mandatum non reperitur ibi persona five
subjectum, Nuncius enim nihil in se c^ncipit, sed portat in ore suo verbum
Domini; et si Dominus non mandavit, nihil est, nihil loquitur: Porre quum per
Nuncium contrahitur, ipsi principales originem contractui dant: Consensus autem
debet esse inter eos qui dant originem contractui, Sed ubi non est mandatum,
non est Consensus. Ergo nihil potest ratificari, scias etiam quod obligatio non
potest esse sine radice, nec radix sine Consensu, nec Consensus sine Actu, unde
cum tria habeant substantiare Contractum, scilicet persona, quantum ab
habilitatem; voluntas, quantum ad Consensum; potestas, quantum ad Nuncium, haec
tria d^sunt in falso Nuncio, quia nec est persona, nec voluntas, nec popestas,
concipit etiam verba, in persuna quam non repraesentat, voluntatem ejus
annunciat, quae non est, denique in se nihil omnino, in alio direct non
potest, quare resultat omnino impossible, de jure vero impossibilium nulla est
obligatio, Haec ille.
.

29. Secondly, where it is collected that the Contract of Matrimony made by a
general Mandate may be ratified Bald. in l. generale ff. de ritu nup.
, this Conclusion is not so general in sense, as in words; for the Case of that
Law whence this Conclusion is drawn, is this: The Father does constitute a
Proctor to get a Husband for his Daughter Vide Text. in d. L. generale. ff. de
ritu nup.
; the Question is, Whether this Mandate be sufficient? It is answered
Negatively, (that is to fay) That the Daughter hereby cannot contract Matrimony
gloss. in. d. L. generale.
, unless the Father do ratify the same d. L. generale.
; for thou shall understand, that by the Civil Law (where this Case is put) the
Child cannot contract Matrimony without the Father's consent Instit. de Nuptiis
in princ. ibi dum tamen L. nuptus ff. de ritu nup.
; but yet in this Case, if the Father ratify the Contract, it suffices d. L.
generale ff. de ritu nup.
. And this is the particular meaning of that general Conclusion, which how far
it is distant from our Case, and impertinent, is easily discerned; for there
the Parties themselves contract Matrimony, and the Question is, Whether the
Fathers consent may be supplied by Ratification? But here both of the Parties
do not contract together, and the Question is, Whether the Parties consent may
be supplied by Ratification? There the Mandate is general, but not revoked;
here special, but erroneous and revoked; wherefore although Ratification be
sufficient in that Case, yet does it not follow that therefore it suffices in
this Case Ex separatis non infertur. L. ultim. ff. de Calum. Add quod omnis
Doctor intelligendus est secundum legem quam allegat. J^s. in L. filiofam. de
leg. 1. ff. n. 129.
.

30. Thirdly, Where it is affirmed that the nullity or invalidity of an Act,
occasioned through the defect of Consent, so soon as the Consent comes is
purged, and the Act confirmed Anchar. in c. ratihabitionem de Reg. Jur. in
Sexto per c. 1. de despons. impub. eod. lib. 6.
: That is true when both the Parties afterward give their mutual Consents,
otherwise not d. c. 1. de despons. impub. and DD. ibidem. Covar. Tract. de
Spons. prima part, c. 5.. 1. Felin. in c. ex part Deeani, de rescrip. extra.
n. 11. ampli. 4.
. For Example; Two Children Contract Matrimony together, this Contract is void
for want of their consent c. ubi de despons. impub. extra.
; for Children can neither consent nor dissent d. c. ubi L. ejus est nolle. ff.
de Reg. Jur.
; afterward, when they be of ripe Age, they both mutually consent: By this
Ratification the Contract is made good, and so is the former Conclusion to be
understood Viz. quod nullitas dispositionis ex defectu Consensus proveniens,
purgatur superveniente Consensu, ad cujus Conclusionis confirmationem Anchor.
allegat. c. 1. de desp. impub. in Sext. quod quidem c. loquitur, ubi impuberes
contrahunt, quorum nisi uterque post pubertatem consentiat, unius tantum
Consensus nihil operatur, DD. in d. c. 1. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. prima
part, c. 5.. 1. and infra.
: But if one of them alone should ratify the former Contract, the other not,
(as in our Case) it were to no purpose Immo si pubes cum impubere contraxerit,
qui factus pubes expressim ratificaverit, dissentiente tamen altero, and ad
secundas Nuptias convolante, tenet hoc secundum Matrimonium, Testibus Hostiens.
in Tit. de des pons. impub.. quid juris. n. 15. and Covar. Tract. de Sponsal.
prima part, c. 5.. 1. n. 8.
, and so this third Reason is of no force.

31. Finally, whereas it is concluded, That albeit the Error be such as does
destroy the Marriage, yet nevertheless, if when the Error is detected, the
Party do ratify and confirm the Contract, it is of no less force than if the
Party had not erred c. 2. de conjug. Serve. extra.
. This Conclusion is true, if there be not somewhat else to hinder the effect

Law, the Marriage be void, yet by the Man's ratification thereof, after the
Error be detected, the Marriage is made good d. c. 2. de conjug. Serve.

hinder the force and efficacy of the ratification, then it is, as if there were
no ratification Vide Boic. and Praepos. in c. proposuit de conjug. Serve. extra.
: Now in our Case, the King of Cyprus did not only err in the Person of
Agnesia, (if the Error were in her Person, and not in her Quality, viz. her
Name and Age, whereof afterward Infra.

at the time of the Contract the King did not speak by his Messenger DD. maxim

32. Thus we see (to return to the general Question) That if the Party revoke
his Proctor, and afterward ratify the Contract made by him so revoked, this
ratification does not make good the Contract: Something (I confess) may be
objected probably against the Reasons of this Negative Conclusion Veluti quod
revocati Procuratoris acta tunc demum ratificari non possunt, quando revocatio
facta fuit respectu ipsius actus, secus si intuitu personae vel quando dubitat
quo respectu. Bald. in l. falsus C. de furto. Item quod falsi Procuratoris seu
Nuntij gesta non possunt ratificari, ubi verba Contractus sunt concipienda
nomine absentis; Id quod hic necessarium non est. Alex. cons. 149. vol. 5.
denique quod dolus non viciat matrimonium etiamsi det causam Contractui. Abbas
in c. cum dilectus. de his quae vi metusve Cause. extra.
, but not sufficiently Nam quod ad primum fundamentum attinet, Mandatum
revocatum fuit, non intuitu personae procuratoris, sed actus; secundum autem
fundamentum solidissimum permanet, quicquid in contrarium objicitur; Nec valet
istud Argumentum in contrahendis Nuptiis, Non opus est proferre verba in nomine
Domini, Ergo ratificari possunt falsi Nuncij gesta. Postremo non tam adfuit
dolus Regis quam abfuit Consensus Agnesiae.
in my Opinion; wherefore the same Conclusion has place, not only when the
Proctor is certified of the revocation, but also when he is ignorant thereof c.
fin. de procur. in Sext.
, as is aforesaid; nor then only when the Party does by express words revoke
his Proctor Covar. Tract. de Spons. secunda part, c. 4. n. 11. in princ.
, but also when he does any Act which does imply a revocation, as when he does
make a second Mandate to contract Matrimony with any other Woman c. si duo. de
procur. in Sext. Covar. ubi supra.
; nor then only, when the Party (which contracteth Matrimony with the revoked
Proctor) is certified of the others error and revocation Praepos. in c. 2. de
conjug. Serve. extra. n. 10.
, but also whiles such error and revocation is yet unknown, may the same Party
marry elsewhere, either before or after the ratification Praepos. ubi supra.
. Indeed, if both Parties, notwithstanding the said error and revocation, give
their mutual Consents to be Man and Wife, the Contract is good from this time
of their new Consent, but not from that time of their first Contract Praepos.
ubi supra. DD. in c. ultim. de pro. cur. in Sext. gloss. in c. dilectus de

33. As by a Proctor c. ultim. de procur. in Sext.
, so by a Messenger L. sufficit. L. ultim de Sponsal. ff. Hostiens. Summa. Tit.
de Spons. and Matrimonio. qualiter extra.
, Spousals or Matrimony may be contracted betwixt them that are absent. Of
Messengers there be two sorts DD. in c. ultim. de procur. in Sext. and in L.
Multum C. si quis alteri vel sibi.
: The one having a sufficient Mandate or Authority to deal in the behalf of the
Party from whom he is sent: The other having no such Authority or Warrant, but
employed only about the Expedition of a bare Fact, as the delivery of a mere
Message, or sole portage of a Letter, etc. Ibidem.


34. Of the former of these, I have spoken before, for whosoever has a
sufficient Mandate to contract Matrimony, is usually called a Proctor c. ultim.
de procur. in Sext. Summa Silvestr. verb. matrimonium.. 5 q. 9. n 9. Summa
Angel. verb. matrimonium. el. 2. n. 18. Immo omnis Nuncius dicitur Procurator,
sed non omnis Procurator Nuncius, Bald. in L. multum. C. si quis alteri vel

, although in nature (so far as I can learn) he be nothing else but a Messenger
Covar. Tract de Sponsal. secunda part c. 4. n. 8. in fin. Alex. consil. 149.
n. 14. Gem. Franc. and alij in c. ultim. de procur. in Sext.
, betwixt whom and a Proctor (properly understood) there is this notable
difference often to be remembered; The voice of the Messenger is the sound of
his Masters Will Ear. in l. qui autem. constituere ff. de constit. pec. n. 3.
Bald. in l. multum n. 4. C. Si quis sibi vel alteri.
, whose mind being uttered by the others Mouth Qua de Causa DD. communiter
dicunt Nuncium esse picam seu organum quo Dominus vocem suam in alterius
auditum transferat.
, the Master is immediately tied to the other Party, with whom the Contract is
made; and which Party is likewise directly tied and bound to the Master, by the
promise made to the Messenger, as if the Parties themselves were both
personally present together, and with their own Mouths did speak each to the
other, and with their own Ears hear each other speak DD. in L. multum C. Si
quis alteri vel sibi.
: But a Proctor, albeit as a Proctor, and not in his own name, he do make any
Contract with another Person, This Contract is originally rooted in the
Proctor, and thence derived to the Master L. per procuratorem de procur. l. fi
procurator. cum LL. seq. mandati L. possessio quousque.. and si possessio. de
acquir poss. ff.
, who by the Civil Law has no direct action against the other Person, for
performance of the Contract without Cession, or grant first made by the Proctor
An autem ex Contractu Procuratoris vel Nuncij acquiratur nobis actio ipso jure,
vel mediante cessione, si quis scire cupiat, Angelum velim perlegat sic
distinguentem. Si aliquis contrahit ut Nuncius, Domino acquiritur Actio
directa, Si ut Procurator, tunc aut est subjectus Domim potestati (veluti
filius vel servus) and acquiritur Domino absque alia concessione, aut om nino
est illius potestati Subditus: Et tunc quoad jura realia, facta scilicet, vera
traditione Procuratori, acquiruntur dominium and possessio, absque alia
cessione; quoad vero actiones personales, si contrahit praesente Domino, Domino
quaeritur Actio sine cessione, quod si absente eo contrahit, tunc aut super re
Domini, aut super alia re, re Domini vendita, quaeritur Domino utilis, sine
cessione actio, In altero Casu semper est necessaria cessio. haec Angel. in L.
multum C. si quis alteri vel sibi, etc.
. The former of these two I may compare to a Merchants Prentice or Servant, the
other to his Factor or Dealer beyond the Seas; The Apprentice having sold and
delivered his Masters Wares forth of the Shop, the Merchant by and by has a
direct Action, and may in his own name prosecute against the buyer for the
price thereof, as if he himself had sold and delivered the Wares Sicut enim qui
servum proprium Institorem proposuit, sibi acquirit actionem, attententa Juris
Civilis dispositione L. 1. de institor. action ff. Ita qui famulum ad merces
vendendas etiam liberum constituit (respecta lege Regni nostri municipali) Id
quod nostratibus notissimum est.
; But if the Factor Per Factorem, Institorem intellige, quos enim Jus appellat
Institores Vulgus nuncupat Factores, Wesemb. in tit. de Instit. action. ff. in
princ. Capyc. dec. 180. and decis. Gem. c. 14. n. 43.
buy or sell Wares beyond the Seas, by the Civil Law, the Merchant has no
direct Action against the Buyers and Sellers in that behalf Utcunque enim qui
Institorem praeposuit poterit conveniri, convenire tamen nequit, Si vel liberum
hominem, vel etiam servum alienum Institorem habeat L. 1. ff. de Institor. act.
; (except in certain Cases) Wesemb. in Tit. de Institor. act. ff. L. Julianus..
Si Procurator. de action. Empti. ff. and ibi DD.
; and therefore if he will sue them, the Action being first grounded in the
Factor, must be derived or translated to him by Cession from the Factor, e're
he can prosecute the same himself L. 1. de Institor. act. ff. and ibi Bar.
Bald. Castrens. and alij.
: Hence it is that the Acts of a revoked Messenger are utterly void, albeit he
be not certified of the revocation c. ultim. de procur. in Sext. and ibi
Dominic. de 8. Gem. Phil. Franc. and Anch.
; but the Act of revoked Proctor is good until he be certified thereof c.
mandata de procur. extra. L. Si. mandassem ff. mandati c. ex part Decani. de
rescr. extra.
, as is aforesaid.

35. When as the Messenger has no Mandate, being charged only with the bare
dilivery of a Message or a Letter, diverse questions are moved. First, what if
the Party to whom the Message or Letter importing Consent of Matrimony, being
delivered, do immediately upon the receipt thereof express the like Consent,
Whether is the Contract hereby fully finished? Or whether is it to be expected,
that the Party which sent the Letter or Message do first understand thereof,
and approve the same?

36. The Answer is, That albeit, it may seem at the first view that the
Approbation of the Party which, sent the Letter or Message is to be expected
Vide Angel. de Clavas. verb. Matrimonium el. 2. n. 21.
, because as yet there does not appear a Consent, that is, a mutual agreement
at one instant, without the which there cannot be a perfect Contract c. Tuae.
de Sponsal. extra.
, in as much as one of the Parties does consent at one time, and the other
Party at another time; yet nevertheless, because the Party which did first
consent is still presumed to continue and persevere in the same Mind, until the
time of the others Consent Id quod procedit etiamsi is qui procuratorem misit,
nec consentiat nec dissentiat, nec interim de ea re cogitet. Hostiens. in Rub.
de Sponsal.. qualiter. col. 2. Pri. er. verb. matr. el 5. q. 11.
, as has been heretofore declared, it follows, that there is a mutual
Consent at one and the same instant Siquidem ubi est Continuatio Consensus, ibi
Consensus dicitur esse simultaneus, Test Zasio. con. fill. 5. lib. 2. n. 22.
; By which mutual Consent the Contract is fully perfected and finished Summa
Angel. verb. matr. el. 2. n. 21. versic. Sed nunquid.
: Whereupon it is concluded by the general Consent of such as do handle this
question, that as soon as the Party, to whom the Message or Letters of
Matrimony is sent, does condescend thereunto, by expressing like Consent as the
Message or Letters do import (whether it be Matrimony or Spousals only), The
Contract is by and by perfect, without any expectation Zas. consil. 3. n. 8.
and consil. 5. n. 6. vol. 2. Summa Angelic. ubi supra Anchor. consil. 228.
Butr. consil. 64. Summa Rosella verb. Matr. el. 2. sed cum non.
; unless it appear that the Party which sent the Message or Letter did dissent
before the others Consent Anto. Guber. Tract. de Sponsal. fol. 25. n. 19. Summa
Angel and Summa Rosella ubi supra.
; but if this appear not, then albeit privily the Party indeed dissent, yet for
defect of proof it shall be adjudged, as if the Party had not at all dissented
Summa Rosella. lcco praealleg. Anto. Gubert. tract. de Sponsal. fol. 25. n. 19.
: Idem est non esse and non apparere L. in lege and ibi Bar. de contra^end.
Emp. ff.
, Not to be, and not to appear, is all one in Construction of Law.

37. Secondly, It is demanded whether the Woman may contract Matrimony by a
special Messenger or Letters, as well as the Man? To this question it is
answered, That albeit by the Civil Law it seems that she cannot Jure enim
civili non videtur uxor esse nisi deducatur in Dominium Viri. L. mulierem and
L. seq. ff. de ritu nup.
; Yet nevertheless by the Canon Law (which Law prevails in this Case) L. 1.
Consil. Matr. consil. 25. n. 2. communiter Canonistae in c. In praesentia de
Sponsal. extra. Schneid. tract. de Nuptijs fol. 48. n. 13.
, it is concluded that she may Benedic. de Caper. Thesaur. com. opin. verb.
Lex. n. 23.
; and that there is no difference of Sex, in this respect Hostiens. in Rub. de
Sponsal.. qualiter versic. Hoc tamen ne, viz. ad imparia judicentur vir and
uxor. Summa Hostiens. ubi supra. per c. Gaudemus. de divortiis extra.
.

38. Thirdly, What if one Man hearing another say, [that he has a great
affection toward such a Woman for Marriage; or that he will have her for, or
to his Wife,] do thereupon of his own accord and proper motion, go unto her;
and declaring what he had heard, contract Matrimony with her in the other Man's
name, Whether is this a good Contract, yea, or no? It is answered that it is
not lib. 2. consil. Matr. consil. ibidem 17. n. 4. verse. quod autem.
, for a Messenger must be specially sent for that purpose d. consil. per.
gloss. in l. 1. in fin. de contrah. Emp. ff. and gloss. in L. consensu ff. de
act. and oblig. lib. 1. consil. Matr. consil. ibidem. 83. n. 13.
.

39. In contracting Matrimony or Spousals by Letters, this one thing
principally is to be observed, namely, That as it is necessary for that Party,
which sends the Letters containing words fit for Spousals or Matrimony, [As I
promise hereby that I will, or that I do take thee to my Wife, etc.] do still
continue in the same mind without alteration, until the time of the others
Consent Summa Angelic. verb. Matrimonium. el. 2. n. 20. Zas. cons. 5. n. 6.
versic. and quidem and in 7. vol. 2.
: So on the other side, it is necessary, that that Party to whom the Letters
are sent, upon receipt thereof, or shortly after do express the like Consent,
either to him which brought the Letters or to some others, or else by Letters
to the former Party Summa Angelic. and Zas. ubi supra. Idem Zas. consil. 2. n.

and Arch. ubi supra.
; if the Party delivering the Letters do inwardly repent, or the Party
receiving the Letters, do in heart consent (howsoever toward him which is the
Searcher of the Heart, there is no difference betwixt secret and manifest
Repentance, or manifest and secret Consent), yet toward his Church, and by
Construction of Law, this inward Repentance of the one, or secret Consent of
the other is not regarded, when it is not proved Prier. verb. Matrimonium el.

Tit. de Sponsal.. qualiter. col. 2. c. honorantem. 32 q. 2. and ibi DD.
Aetiologia est, Ecclesia non judicat de occultis c. consuluisse 2. q. 5.
; Although by the Opinion of some it may seem, that if the Party receiving and
reading the Letters, do not expressly contradict or dissent, it is of like
force, as if the Party had expressly consented August. Berous in subscriptione

: But I dare not deliver this Opinion for current; For what if for modesty or
other like Consideration, the Party think good not to reveal the secrets of the
Letter; Surely he were very hasty, or rather Captious in my Conceit, that would
account this modest or discreet Silence, for a resolute Consent Archid. in c.

; and therefore not to be undertaken suddenly, or concluded without due
premeditation or deep deliberation c. qui Sitit. 33. q. 5.

40. If any object this Rule, Qui tacet consentire videtur c. qui tacet de Reg.
Jur. lib. 6.
. To him might be objected the very next Rule following, Is qui tacet non
fatetur, sed nec utique negare videtur c. is qui eod. tit.
: But because the Brocardes or contrary Conclusions, rather breed brabbles,
than pacify Contentions, this I think a more indifferent answer: In strict and
proper signification, he which holds his peace, does neither consent nor
dissent Felin. in c. Nonne de praesump. extra. n. 5. verse. prima regula, etc.
Est enim tacere medium quoddam inter expressam voluntatem and contradictionem.
; Nevertheless in Construction or interpretation of Law, he is sometimes said
to consent according to the former Rule; and sometimes not, according to the
second Rule Felin. in d.c. Nonne. ubi ponit quatuor regulas cum suis fallentijs.
: The affirmative Rule has place, when the matter tends altogether to the
benefit and favor of the Party Panor. and Canonistae. in d. c. Nonne. Bart.
and Legistae in l. quae dotis ff. Sol. Matr.
, for then to be silent is to consent, except in certain Cases Felin. in d. c.
Nonne. n. 20, etc.
; but the Case being altered, the Law is likewise altered; for if the matter be
such as may be greatly prejudicial to the Party, then the negative Rule has
place, that is to say, To be silent, is not to consent. Now it is generally
concluded; that Matrimony is a matter of very great prejudice, and a kind of
Servitude or Bondage L. 2. de libero hom. exhibend. ff.
; Inasmuch as thereby, as well the Husband as the Wife are deprived of their
former liberty, and power over their own Bodies; for after they be Married, the
Husband has now no power over his own Body, but the Wife Epist. 1. ad Corinth.
c. 7. verse. 3.
; neither the Wife over her own Body, but the Husband Ibidem.
. Yea, and (as Baldus says) it is Dura Servitus, a hard Servitude, because it
is for ever indissoluble Bald. in L. In bonae fidei C. de reb. cred. n. 1.
versic. Item in Causis.
, how hard soever the Match be; whereas every other Servitude, may at any time
be dissolved, the Lord or Master Canonistae in d.c. Nonne. Legistae. in d. L.

; and that there is one Author who has reckoned an hundred Commodities issuing
from Marriage Gilbertus in question. Oeconomic.
; but the same Author has also numbered two hundred Discommodities thereto
belonging Idem Gilbertus ubi supra.
: Wherefore in a matter subject to so many perils, and so great prejudice, it
savoureth not of Equity, that Silence should be reputed for Consent Archid. in
c. nec illud. 30. q. 5. Gem. in c. ultim. de procur. in Sext. Summa Angel. and

41. Again, If that Opinion were true, to wit, That the Party receiving the
Letters, and not contradicting the same, were to be judged to have consented
thereunto Quam tamen non puto omnino veram in praeposita facti specie.
, yet there be diverse things requisite to work that Effect Ut per Machesil.
notab. 22. Coepol. cautel. 9. and Francis. Ripam. in c. cum M. de constitut.
extra. n. 132.
. First therefore it must be proved by sufficient Witnesses that the Party did
read the Letters Mathesil. Coepol and Ripa ubi supra. gloss. in clem. 1. de
procur. Augustine. Berous in Subscrip. consil. 4. Uldalrici Zasij vol. 2. Alex.
in L. quo enim. 1. ff. rem rat. hab.
. Secondly it is requisite that the Witnesses did understand the tenor thereof
ibidem.
; for if it be not proved that the Letters were read, the Party is presumed to
be ignorant of the Contents thereof Mathesil. d. notab. 22. Gabriel. l. 1. com.
conclus. Tit. de praesump. concl. 2. n. 11.
, and being ignorant cannot consent thereunto, since nothing is more contrary
to Consent than Ignorance L. Ignorans. C. de Dom. L. si per errorem. de Juris.

; or the reading of the Letters being proved, if the Witnesses did not
understand the Contents of the Letters, they are not able to depose
concludently Zas. d. cons. 4. vol. 2. in Subscrip. Matthesil. d. not. 22.
, seeing it may be some other Letter than they imagined, which the Party
received and read Traditur igitur Cautela, ut literas transmissurus, easdem in
praesentia testium scribat, and Copiam (ut dicunt) earundem cisdem tradat, ac

42. What if the Party which sent the Letters, expressing an assured Promise of
Matrimony, after the Woman have received the same, and yielded her full Consent
thereunto, misliking the Match, deny that he wrote or sent any such Letters,
and there be no Witnesses to prove the same, Whether is proof made by
Comparation or Similitude of hands, a full and sufficient proof, yea or no?

43. Some say it is not Alex. consil. 76. vol. 3. n. 8. and 9. Molin. in

betwixt the true and counterfeit Writing Panor. in d. c. 2. de fid. Instr. n.

these Requisites or Observations following being performed Zas. de cons. 4.
vol. 2. in fin.
.

45. First of all therefore (as touching the Order and Form of this Comparation
of hands) it is requisite that two Writings be produced and exhibited, namely,
the Letter it self containing the Promise of Matrimony, being the Writing in
Controversy, and another Writing, being certainly and without dispute or
controversy of the Parties hand Bar. in L. comparationes. n. 1. Bald. n. 5.
Angel. n. 5. Castrens. n. 3. C. de fide Instr. Zas. de cons. 4. in fin. Panor.
in c. 2. n. 13. de fide Instr. extra.
; for according to the Rules of Logic, Id quod probat, debet esse certius and
clarius eo, quod probandum est Sichard. in d. L. comparationes. n. 17.
; That which does prove ought to be more certain, than that which is to be
proved: Of which two Writings, the one, that is the clear and undoubted
Writing, is termed Scriptura a qua, the other ad quam Bar. Bald. Angel.
Castrens. Sichard. and alii in d. L. comparationes. Ripa. in L. admonen. di. de
Jurejur. ff. n. 108.
, because from this faithful Writing (as from a trusty Interpreter which will
not lie) Collation or Comparation is made unto that other Writing in
controversy DD. in d. L. comparationes. Menoch. de Arbitr. Jud. lib. 2. cas.
114. n. 29.
, for trial whether it be a Counterfeit or not; In which respect also the one
Writing is called the Agent extreme, and the other the Patient extreme Bald. in
d. L. comparationes. n. 5.
: The Agent is produced to prove the Identity of the other Writing: The Patient
is that whose Identity is to be proved, and which is used for the obtaining of
that which is demanded Angel. in d. L. comparationes connex. Anth. and si
contractus, C de fide Instr.
. But as Mercury is not made of every Wood (according to the old Proverb) so
every Writing is not fit to be that fundamental Writing a qua, or Agent
extreme, from the which Comparation is to be deduced Sichard. post alios. in d.
L. comparationes. Menoch. de Arbitr. Jud. cas. 114. n. 29.
; For what if the Writing, which is to be used as a true Touchstone, stand in
need it self to be touched or compared, I mean, what if it cannot otherwise
appear to be of the Parties hand, but by Comparation of other Writings? Surely
this Writing is utterly unfit for this purpose Menoch. d. cas. 114. n. 29. in
fin.
, for that were to prove ignotum per ignotius, and to protract the matter in
infinitum, always abiding and dwelling upon uncertainties Menoch. d. cas. 114.
n. 30.
.

46. In ancient time therefore, so precise were the Lawmakers in this Case,
that they did admit no more but three kinds of Writings, from the which
Comparation might be made Julianus praesectus praetor. in Text. L.
comparationes.. Ideoque Sancinus C. de fide Instr.
, viz. a Writing subscribed by three Witnesses, (two of them at least
testifying the same) a Judicial Writing, that is, some Act written before a
Judge; and a public Instrument or Writing made in Solemn Form, by a public
Notary d.. Ideoque. and. etenim in d. L. comparationes. and ibi Bald. n. 8.
, whereunto afterward two others were added Anthen. Adhaec. C. de fide Instr.
, viz. that the Writing produced there be confessed by the Party Anthen.

be kept d. Anth. Adhaec. Quod si quis objiciat hanc additionem esse superfluam,
and comprchendi sub tertio genere Scripturarum, de quo in d. L. comparationes;

publicum registrata, non immerito publicum testimonium prohibeat. Bart. in d.
Anth. and Sichard. in d.L. comparationes. n. 8. and 9.
. Howbeit at this day, by the common Consent of the best Writers, any manner of
Writing, either Public or Private, Judicial or Extrajudicial, of what nature
or quality soever, (so that it appear undoubtedly to be of the Parties hand) is
sufficient to be the Agent extreme, or Writing from the which Comparation is to
be made Sichard. in d. L. comparationes. n. 10. post Sabir. ibidem col. 4.

; or if there be no such Writing at all, the Judge may command and compel the
Party to write, that thereby (Comparation being made) the truth may appear,

.

47. Secondly, It is requisite that the Party which procures this Comparation,
do swear, That he has not any other fit or sufficient proof Anth. Tit. de
Instr. fide and Cautel.. Si vero nihil gloss. in d. L. comparationes in fide,
unde patet quod comparatio est remedium subsidiarum, non aliter competenS quam
quaudo non aliter sit probatio. Zas. d. consil. 4. in fin.
, and that he has not done, nor endeavored any thing thereabouts, which
peradventure might suppress or hide the truth d.. Si voro nihil. Sichard. in d.
L. comparationes. n. 2. Id quod pro mirabili traditur, and singulari nimirum,

fiant, quam quae in generale. Gloss. in. Si vero moriantur. Anth. de Instr.
Cautel. and fide Sichard. ubi supra.
.

48. Thirdly, It is requisite that the Notaries or others skilful in writing,
to whom the Judge does commit this Comparation, be sworn, That they shall not
do any thing therein either for favor or gain, or fear or disfriendship, or
other sinister affection L. comparationes. C. de fide Instr. Sed annon ipse
Judex. debet per se facere comparationem? Dic quod debet quidem per se,
a^hibitis tamen Nostratiis and scribendi peritis. Sichard. post Ang. in d. L.
comparationes.
, but that they shall uprightly and diligently view the Writings, and compare
them indifferently, and then make true relation to the Judge what they have
done, and what they judge or believe Nam quum. decipi possint similitudine
tractatus jurabunt, non de veritate praecisa, Sed de credulitate tantum.
Sichard. ubi supra.
in their skill, concerning the identity or diversity of the hands.

49. Fourthly, It is requisite that these Notaries or skilful Persons, in
viewing and comparing these foresaid Writings, do not only consider the simple
Letters or Grammatical Elements, subject to Corporal sense, but also the Style
and Phrase thereof, subject to Reason and understanding Bald. in L.
comparationes C. de fide Instr. n. 18. Menoch. de Arb. Jud. lib. 2. cas. 1.14.
n. 31. Sichard. in d. L. comparationes. n. 11.
; for as a Bird is known by her Tune, or a Harp or other Instrument by the
sound, so by the Consonance of the Style we may judge probably of the Author
Bald. ubi supra.
.

50. Fifthly, It is requisite that these aforesaid Notaries and Writers make
relation or report unto the Judge (by virtue of their Oaths) of their
Proceedings, and what they have done or deemed, and judge of the Similitude or
Dissimilitude of the foresaid Writings Creditur tamen sufficere, quod semel
juravit ant equam comparationem faciunt, ideoqu^ non esse necesse ut nunc denuo
tempore relationis, secundum Juramentum subeunt, Menoch. d. casu. 114. n. 28.
: Others have added other Requisites, namely, That relation being made by the
Notaries and Witnesses of the similitude of the Hands, the Judge ought to
interpose his interlocutory Sentence of the Identity of the Writings, that is
to say, that they were both written with one Hand Scil. in d. L comparationes
col. pen. Menoch. d. cas. 114. n. 32.
.

51. Some also have been of this mind, That whereas there be five kinds of
Writings above recited, whereby Comparation might be made, in their Opinion,
not only all other kind of Writings were excluded Salic. ubi supra. Cur. Sen.
in L. admonendi. de jurejur. ff. n. 114. Menoch. de cas. 114. n. 32.
, but also the Writing in Controversy could not be compared but by another
Writing of the same kind; as if the Writing in Controversy were a public
Writing, then to be tried by a public Writing; if a private Writing, then by a
private Writing, etc. In qua opinione steterunt Bar. in Anth. Et si contractus
C. de fide Instr. n. 2. and Angel. in L. comparationes. eod Tit. n. 8. Quibus
subscripsit Augustinus Berous in Addic. ad Zas. consil. 4. vol. 3. and Paris.
cons. 19. n. 38. vol. 3.
Howbeit this Opinion is generally condemned; for any kind of Writing in
question may be tried by any other kind of Writing, being without question of
the Parties hand Hugolin. de quo Sichard. in d. L. comparationes. n. 9. and
alii de quibus Bald. ead L. n. 11.
.

52. Finally, There is to be noted, that in all other Judicial Proceedings and
Decrees, it behooves the Judge to have plu^beos pedes Bald. in d. L.
comparationes n. 11. qui dicit op. esse veriorem. and Sichard. ead. L^u. 10.
qui refert eandem op. communiter teneri, and practicari, Quibus convemunt Ripa
in L. admonendi ff. de jure jur. n. 111. Menoch. d. cas. 114. n. 29. Cravetta
consil. 216. n. 18.
, Feet of Lead; so in this matter of Comparation, especially it behooves him to
have and plumbeos pedes, and Lynceos coulos, not only Feet as heavy as lead,
but Eyes also as clear and sharp as Lynceus, of whom it is reported, that he
was able to see through a Millstone Zas. lib. 2. sing. respons. c. 25. in fin.
Covar. pract. q. c. 22.
; for if the Judge be either so swift, that he run to this Comparation without
observation of these Requisites above recited, doubtless the Comparation will
be of little force Acron. in Horatium.
; and so his great have shall make but small speed; or if his Judgment be not
very Sharp, and more Subtle than the Serpent, how orderly soever he proceed to
work about the Examination of these Writings, yet happily he may be deceived by
counterfeit Instruments Zas. cons. 4. lib. 2. in subscrip. Sichard. in L.
comparationes de fide Instr. n. 5. Paris. consil. 19. n. 35. vol. 3.
; for it is a thing generally complained on in all Ages, namely the great
Cousenage that has been practiced by Forgery, or making of Counterfeit and
Adulterous Writings; Amongst others I remember Zasius (the most famous Lawyer
that ever Germany bred) makes mention of a certain Monk of the Monastery of
St. Vdalrick in the City Augusta, that was so passing skilful, that if he had
looked upon any Writing, he would have imitated the same so lively, as it
should seem rather to be the very original it self, than like unto it Hyppol.
in Rub. de prob. de prob. C. n. 317. Maschard. Tract. de probat. concl. 330. n.
3.
. I wish we had no greater store of false Forgeries than of mumbling Monks at
this day in England, a thing rather to be wished than hoped, the more is the
pity; for though the famous Forger of Ripon in Yorkshire be dead, whom I
marvail Mr. Green has not numbered amongst his Cony Catchers, yet I fear there
be a great many Whelps of the old Dog left alive, that had rather bite than
bark. And therefore since this matter is so subject to their Impostures, it
stands the Judge in hand to be so much the more circumspect, lest he himself
be caught for a simple Cony. Zas lib. 2. sing. resp. c. 25. Gravat. in addic.

SECT. XIV. Of Public and Private Spousals.
1. FOurthly, Spousals be either Public or Private Reusner. de Sponsal. Lib.
1. q. 1. Panor. and Praepos. in c. cum Inhibitio. de clandestin. despons.

and wherein are observed all other Solemnities requisite by the Ecclesiastical
Law c. nostrates. 30. q. 5. Reusner. de Sponsal. lib. 1. q. 1. n. 1.
: For so careful were the ancient Lawmakers to avoid those mischiefs, which
commonly attend upon secret and clandestine Contracts, that they would have the
same Solemnities observed in contracting Spousals, which be requisite in
contracting Matrimony Panor. in c. cum inhibitio. de clandestin de Spons.

vide Schneidwin. Tract. de nuptijs fol. 22. ubi refert Sponsalia sex modis dici
posse clandestina. ex Hostiens. in Rub. de clandest. despons. extra.
, but especially when as there be no Witnesses present at the Contract c. 1, 2,
and 3. de clandestin. despons. extra. Schneidwin. ubi supra Melchior Kling.
Tract. de Matrimonio fol. 68. Jo. Frigeus Tract. de Sponsal. page 266.
: In which Case these questions following are usually propounded.

2. First, whether such secret Contracts be good in Law, yea, or no? And it
seems they are not good, by reason it is thus written in the Text of the Law,
Nullum pactum, nullam conventionem, nullum Contractum inter eos videri volumus
subsequutum, qui lege contrahere prohibente, contrahunt L. non. dubium and. de
legib. c. nullum. 30. q. 5.
; We will that no part, no Covenant, no Contract, shall be thought to follow,
betwixt them which do contract, when as the Law does forbid them to contract;
But the Law does forbid all Persons to make Secret Contracts of Spousals, or
Matrimony d. c. nullum and Titul. de clandestin. despons. extra. per totum.
; and that justly, considering the manifold discommodities depending thereupon,
namely, for that hereby it comes to pass oftentimes, that the Parties secretly
contracting, are otherwise formally affianced, or so near in Blood that they
cannot be Married; or being free from those impediments, yet do they alter
their purposes, denying and breaking their promises, whence Perjuries,
Adulteries, and Bastardies, with many more intolerable mischiefs do succeed
Schneidwin tract. de nuptijs fol. 23. Covar. tract. de Sponsal. secunda. part.
c. 6. in princ. n. 7.
; and therefore such secret Pacts, Covenants, and Contracts are worthily
reputed, as if they had not been made at all d. c. nullum. 30. q. 5. arg. d. L.
non dubium C. de legib.
. Again, this is a Common Conclusion, Idem est in lege non esse and non
apparere, It is all one in Law not to be, and not to appear L. in lege ff. de
contrahend. Emp. and ibi DD. lib. 2. consil. Matr. consil. ibidem. 2. n. 1.
; Wherefore seeing secret Contracts cannot be proved, it is all one in effect,
as if they were not Reusner. de Sponsal. q. 1. n. 32, 33, etc. Socin. sen.
cons. 119. vol. 3. verse. Secunda Conclusio.
.

3. Others are of another Opinion, holding the Contract for firm and
indissoluble Panor. in c. 1. de cland. despons. extra. n. 2. Dec. consil. 163.
n. 4. Praepos. in Rub. de clandestin. despons. n. 2. Everard. cons. 10. Covar.
tract. de Sponsal. secunda part c. 6. n. 7. Hyero. Schurf. lib. 2. cons. Matr.
consil. 24. n. 1, 2, 3, and 4.
; for the Confirmation whereof, they allege a very round Text, extant in the
Body of the Law, the words are these, Clandestina Conjugia contra leges quidem
fiunt, Contracta tamen dissolvi non possunt c. nec. illud. 30. q. 5.
, Secret Marriages are done indeed against the Law, but being contracted,
cannot be dissolved; Yielding this reason, that because these Solemnities are
not of the Substance of Spousals, or of Matrimony, but consent only Panor. in
c. 1. de clandestin. despons. extra. n. 2.
; for (as another Text says), sufficit nudus Consensus ad constituenda
Sponsalia L. sufficit. de Sponfal. ff.
, Naked Consent is sufficient to make Spousals; And therefore if bare Consent
is sufficient, these Solemnities are not so necessary as without the which
Spousals cannot consist Arg. c. 2. de clandestin. despons. extra. cum gloss.
ibidem. gloss. in c. sufficiat. 27. q. 2. verb. Solus Panor. in c. Tuae. de
Sponsal. extra. n. 2. in fin. Hieron. Schurf. lib. 2. cons. Matr. Consil.
ibidem 24. n. 2, 3, 4.
, being no more than Accidents, the which (as the Logicians teach us) may be
either present or absent, without the destruction of the principal Subject
Ideoque accidens omnium praedicabilum indignissimum dici solet Jo. Casus. Oxon.
de accidente fol. 68.
; So that it may be justly inferred, that the only want of Solemnity does not
hurt the Contract Clandestinitas sola non vitiat Matrimonium, inquiunt
Cardinal. and Praepos. in Rub. de Sponsal. extra. Panor. in c. 1. ecd. Tit. n.
2. Dec. consil. 163. n. 4. Linwood. in c. humana. de clandestin, despons. lib.
4. provincial. Constable. Cant. verb. clandestina. in fin.
.

4. To the Reasons whereupon the contrary Conclusion is collected, it is thus
answered: First, that no Pact, no Covenant, no Contract, shall be thought to be
made betwixt them, whom the Law does prohibit to contract, etc. That Is true,
when the Act is simply forbidden, but when the Act is not simply forbidden, but
only in respect of some quality, which is not of the Substance thereof; Then
the Act done without that Quality, is not to be accounted for undone Bald. in
d. L. non dubium. C. de legib. n. 15. alij aliter solvunt, ut Praepos. in Rub.
de Despons. extra. and Antho. Gubert. Tract. de Matrimonio. fol. 163. nu. 122.
Vide Peckium in c. quae contra jus. de Reg. Jur. in. Sext. and Hyero. Schurff.
lib. 2. consil. Matrimonial. fol. 134. n. 10, 11, 12.
; now to contract Spousals is not simply forbidden, but in some respects only
Hiero. Schurff. lib. 2. consil. Matrimonial. consil. ibidem 24. n. 11.
; And therefore being done without the observation of those unsubstantial
Circumstances, is not to be reputed for undone.

5. As for the other Reason, That not to appear, and not to be, are both one in
Law, that is true Jure fori, non jure poli Gloss. and DD. in c. 2. de cland.
despons. extra. and ibi Praepos. in fin. Melchior. Kling. Tract. de causis
matrimonial. fol. 68, 69. Everard. consil. 11. Lindwood. in c. Humana. de
clandestin. despons. lib. 4. Provincial. Constable. cant. verb. clandestin. in fin.
Baptista Ferret. consil. 174. n. 2.
, Before Man, not before God; for the Church indeed does not judge of secret
and hidden things, whereof there is no appearance c. consuluisse. 2. q. 5. c.
si omnia. 6. q. 1. c. Tua nos. de Sponsal. extra. gloss. in c. 2. de cland.
despons. in princ.
. But most true it is, that Almighty God being (...), before him bare
Conscience alone is as a thousand Witnesses Bald. in Tractat. Schismat. col. 3.
c. literas de restitut. Spol. extra.
; Wherefore I do admonish thee, that have in truth contracted secret Matrimony,
that thou do not marry any other Person; for doubtless this thy pretended
Marriage, how lawful soever it may seem in the eye of Man, who judges only
according to the outward appearance, is nothing, but mere Adultery in the
infallible sight of God's just Judgment, whose Justice rewards every Man
according to his Works, and before whose Tribunal thou must at last appear to
give an account of this thy foul Misdeed.

6. But now admit thou art willing to marry, and the other Party is not only
unwilling, but utterly denies the intent or consent to any Marriage; Whether
in this Case may thou with safe Conscience marry elsewhere? It seems at the
first view, That thou can not marry so long as the other Party lives, to
whom thou did so assuredly give thy faithful Promise of Matrimony, as
appears by thine own Confession, making a full and strong proof against thy
self: Nevertheless, the Case being rightly scanned, I am of their Opinion which
hold that thou may with Safety, not of Law only, but of Conscience also,
proceed to marry any other Person.

7. First, Seeing the other Party constantly denies the intent and consent of
Marriage, for his or her part, without which Consent, as well on the behalf of
that other Party, as on thine own behalf, it is a clear Case, That no Matrimony
can consist, neither in Law nor in Conscience, for the Consent must be mutual
and reciprocal, as I have often confirmed. Is it possible for a Man to be a
Husband without a Wife? Or a Woman to be a Wife without a Husband? Seeing (I
say) the other Party so constantly denies this necessary Consent thou may
safely from thy Conscience act according to this constant denial, and
persuading thy self that the same is true, then art thou at liberty to marry
elsewhere, without any let in Law, or Scruple in Conscience.

8. This Case thus absolved, let us vary the Case a little. A Man and a Woman
are first secretly, yet truly and before God, contracted in Matrimony either of
them, mutually giving there, their full and perfect Consent to the other
therein; afterward the Man is publicly contracted to another Woman in
Matrimony, the former Woman practices all good means, as well by Suit as
otherwise, to recover him for her Husband, but prevails not, for want of
sufficient proof; Whether may she with safe Conscience marry another Husband?
Albeit this Question may seem to appertain to the determination of Divines, yet
will I adventure to signify mine own Opinion, having first resolved another
Question preparatory thereunto; which Question is this.

9. A Man does secretly (I mean without the presence of Witnesses) contract
Spousals or Matrimony with one Woman, and afterward publicly and before a
sufficient number of Witnesses, does make the like Contract with another Woman;
after which second Contract the former Woman charge him, and he likewise
confesses that he was formerly contracted unto her, Whether in this Case,
shall the former secret Contract, or the second public Contract prevail De hac

13. Another Question incident to secret Contracts, is this, A Man and a Woman
are first secretly, yet truly and before God contracted, either of them
mututually giving their full and perfect Consent thereunto; Afterward the Man
is publicly contracted to another Woman; The former Woman practices all good
means as well by Suit as otherwise, to recover him for her Husband, but
prevails not for want of sufficient proof; In this Case whether may she with
safe Conscience Marry another Husband? It seems that she may Arg. c. 1. etc.

another, (of which question we shall have better opportunity to discourse more
at large in another place Infra part tertia..

which being awanting in the former Contract, the Spousals therefore may be
broken without peril; (of which Question also I mean to deliver my Opinion

SECT. XV. Of Contracting Spousals by Signs.
1. IT is an old and a tough Controversy, whether words be necessary in
contracting Spousals or Matrimony Gloss. and DD. in c. Tuae etc. Si inter de
Sponsal. extra. Covar. tract. de Sponsal. secunda part c. 4. in princ. Summa
Silvestrin. verb. matrim.. 2. q. 7. and 8.
; Wherein diverse do hold the affirmative Inno in d. c. Tuae de Spons. extra.
part. Gloss. ibidem. Bar. in L. nuptias de Reg. Jur. ff. Luc. de penna in L. 1.
C. de veteranis. lib. 12.
, at least as touching the Church, (which does not otherwise determine of that
which is conceived inwardly, but that which is expressed outwardly c.
consuluisse. 2. q. 5. c. Is qui 32. q. 2. Innoc. ubi supra.
); and for this affirmative Opinion, there is a ready Text, extant in the
bowels of the Law, containing these words, Matrimonium in veritate contrahitur,
per legitimum Viri, and Mulieris consensum, Sed necessaria sunt (quantum ad
Ecclesiam) verba Consensum exprimentia, etc. c. Tuae. de Sponsal. extra.
Accedit etiam Textus in c. si inter. eod. Tit. ponderando haec verba, Itaque
unus alterum mutuo consensu verbis consuetis expresso, etc.
Matrimony in truth is contracted by lawful Consent of Man and Woman, But words
expressing Consent be necessary, as touching the Church, etc. Others
nevertheless hold the negative Hostiens. in d. c. Tuae. quem sequuntur Anto.
Card. and Panor. eod. loc. Boer. decis. 1. n. 18. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal.
secunda. part. c. 4. n. 1. Socin. Inn. consil. 29. n. 3. vol. 3.
, by reason of another Text, which says, sufficit ad Matrimonium solus illorum
Consensus, de quorum Conjunctionibus agitur c. cum apud. de Sponsal. extra. Cum
igitur sufficiat Consensus, verba non sunt praecise necessaria, quia illud
Doctores sufficere, quo posito nihil aliud requiritur ad substantiam actus.
Angel. Clavas. verb. Matrimonium. el. 2. q. 4.
(id est) Their Consent alone is sufficient for Matrimony, of whose conjunction
there is any ado; and it follows in the same place, that he or she which
cannot speak, may contract Matrimony; the Reason there yielded is this, Quod
verbis non potest, Signis valeat declarari d. c. cum apud. unde si mutus possit
contrahere Matrimonium per signa, multo magis ille qui loqui valeat. arg. D.
Nutu. ff. de leg. 3.
, That which cannot be expressed by words, may be declared by Signs. Seeing
then sole Consent is sufficient; and seeing they which be Dumb and cannot
speak, may lawfully contract Matrimony by Signs, which Marriage is lawful and
available, not only before God, but also before his Church, it follows that
words are not so precisely necessary, as without the which Matrimony cannot be
contracted; and this Conclusion is most commonly received of all, or the most
later Writers Hostiens. Ant. de Butr. Cardinal. and Panor. in c. Tuae de Spons.
extra. Socin. Jun. cons. 29. n. 3. vol. 2. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secu^^

2. To the former Text, which says (as concerning the Church) words be
necessary, etc. Diverse answer diversely: Some, that by this word [necessaria],
is meant [ utilia Cardinal. Zabarel. in c. Tuae de Sponsal. extra.
] profitable: Others that by the word [verba] is also understood [ Signa Prier.
verb. Matrimonium. el. 2. q. 7. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. secunda part c. 4.
n. 1. Intellige tamen, Si modo signa sint Equipollentia sive Consensum

Signs]: Others that words be necessary indeed, yet not for the form or essence
of Matrimony, but for a more certain or readier proof thereof Imol. in rep. de
c. Tuae. col. 7. Panor. eod c. in fin. Boer. consil. 40. n. 25. Praepos. in c.

; and others yield other Answers thereunto Panor. and alij in c. Tuae in fin.
Dicontesque hic non statuitur jus novum, sed respondetur a consulto Q.
propositae, consultus enim qualiter, number verba requirantur ad Matrimonium?
respondet, Quod solus Consensus requiritur, assignans rationem, nempe, quod,
mutus recte contrahit Matrimonium, Ergo verba non sunt necessaria; nec obstat
quod Ecclesia non potest certificari aliter quam per verba, Quia Immo potest
Certificari tam factis, quam verbis, Inquit. Praepos. in d c. Si Rector.
distinc. 43.
: But none of these Answers can satisfy the Authors of the first Opinion, who
albeit, that they cannot but grant, that such Persons as cannot speak, may
contract Spousals or Matrimony by Signs, expressing their Consents c. Cum apud.
de Sponsal extra.
; yet will they not at any hand yield that such as can speak may contract
Matrimony or Spousals by Signs only Debile refugium: Nam si mutus potest
contrahere matrim. multo magis ille qui loqui potest Arg l. nutu de leg. 3. ff.
; And for Confirmation thereof, they do accumulate many Reasons Vide Praepos.
in d. c. Tuae. ubi producit 16 argumenta.
, which because they be more tedious than forceable, I willingly omit, Replying
with this only Argument, viz. If words be of the essence or substantial Form of
Matrimony, Then cannot such, as cannot speak, contract Matrimony Covar. Tract.
de Sponsal. secunda part c. 4. in princ.
: But Dumb Persons may (even by their own Confession), and therefore are not
words of the essence of Matrimony Covar. ubi supra Nichol. Boer. consil. 40. n.
24.
.

3. There is yet a third Opinion, defended by diverse, who laboring studiously
to reconcile the two former Opinions, have devised this distinction, (viz.)
That in case any treatise of Spousals or Matrimony did go before, then Signs
alone without words be sufficient: But if there be no such precedent treatise,
then sole Signs are not sufficient Jo. And. in c. Tuae de Sponsal. extra.
Archid. in c. si Rector. distinct. 43. in fin. Henr. Bo. c. n d. c. Tuae.
. But this third Opinion is not altogether sound Panor. in c. Tuae de Sponsal.
extra n. 2. Boer. consil. 40. n. 18. cum. Seqq.
; for though the former part thereof be true, that is to say, that Signs be
sufficient, where there is a treatise precedent, yet is not the second part
able to withstand the Canon Shot, I mean the Reasons of the Canon, whereby the
first Opinion is overthrown, but must needs also fall and be battered with the
same Bullet Nempe quia verba non sunt de forma essentiali Matrimonij, idcirco
nec opus est, ut praecedant verba, si modo aliter. per signa constare possit de
mutuo contrahentium Consensu.
. Indeed it is true, that if the one Party express his or her Consent by words,
the other by Signs, this Contract is of no less force, than if they had both
uttered their Consents by the same words Henr. Boic. in c. Tuae de Spons.
extra. col. 2. Clavas. in Summa Angel. verb. Matrimonium el. 2. q. 4. in fin.

praes. 2. n. 2. Prier. verb. Matr. el. 2. q. 8.
: As for example, the Man says to the Woman [I do promise that I will Marry
thee, and if thou will Marry me, then kiss me or give me, thy hand], or thus,
[The Man says, I take thee for my Wife, desiring if thou accept me for Gloss.
and Inno. in d c. Tuae and d. c. cum apud. de Spons. extra.
thy Husband, to receive this Ring, or to pledge me in a Cup of Wine; In the
former of which Cases the Woman kissing or giving her Hand accordingly,
Spousals are Contracted; And in the Second Case receiving the Ring or pledging
him, Matrimony is as sufficiently contracted, as if she had expressed her
Consent, by the same words, or others of the like importance Boic. Clavas.
Prier. and Menoch. ubi supra Lapus Alleg. 57. d. consil. 34. n. 5. lib. 2.
consil. matr.
: Likewise albeit neither of the Parties express any words at all, but some
third person recite the words of the Contract, willing them if they be
therewith content, to join their hands together, or to embrace each other; the
Parties so doing, the Contract is of like Efficacy, as if they themselves had
mutually expressed the words before recited by that third Person Panor. in c.
1. de Matrimonio contrah. interd. Ecclesiae. n. 2. and ibi Praepos. Boic. in

c. tenor. de Re. Jud. extra.
.

Nevertheless this is not all, for not only then when the one Party uses
words, and the other Signs; or when a third Person uttering the words, both the
Parties use Signs of Consent, is the Contract good, according to the former
branch of the aforesaid distinction: But even there also, where no words at all
be uttered, neither by the Parties, nor by any third Person, may Spousals or
Matrimony be contracted by Signs only, (so that the same be Significant)
contrary to the second Member of the same distinction, because it is a common
Rule of Law, Ex Equipollentibus utrum fiat nihil interest L. fidei commissa..
Si Cui. de leg. 3. ff. and Bar. in Eund..
, Of things equally forceable, it skilleth not whether be done; Which
Conclusion is especially true in these Cases, where a precise and essential
form is not prescribed Gloss. in clem. 1. in verb. tertio. de vita and hon.
Clericorum Bar. in L. non sunt liberi. ff. de Stat. hom. Tiraquel. de retract.

, as in this, for if words were presscribed for such a form, then could not
such as cannot speak contract Matrimony, or Spousals Covar. tract. de Sponsal.

5. By what kind of words Spousals or Matrimony may be Contracted, is elsewhere
declared at full Supra. ead. part. Paragraphis. 10, and 11.
; Now then it remains, that we speak of such Signs, whereby Spousals or
Matrimony is contracted; And forasmuch as Subarration, that is the giving and
receiving of a Ring, is a Sign of all others, most usual in Spousals and
Matrimonial Contracts DD. in L. ultim. de Despons. impub. extra.
, I think it requisite to speak of it, before all other Signs; the rather
because the Writers upon this Sign have diligently described unto us, what
Persons did first devise the same, and to what end; and what was the matter,
and what the form thereof, on which Finger it ought to be worn, and what is the
Signification of each of those Circumstances, with diverse other Observations
which I will briefly run over.

6. The first Inventer of the Ring (as is reported) Alberic. de Rosa. in suo
Dictionar. in verb. Annulus. Corsetus in suoc Repertorio, in Lecturas Panoreod.
verb. Annulus.
, was one Prometheus; The Workman which made it was Tubal-Cain ibidem.
, of whom there is mention in the fourth of Genesis, that he wrought cunningly
in every Craft of Brass and Iron verse. 22.
: And Tubal-Cain by the Counsel of our first Parent Adam (as my Author tells
me) Alberic. and Corsetus ubi supra.
, gave it unto his Son to this end, that therewith he should espouse a Wife,
like as Abraham delivered unto his Servant Bracelets and Earrings of Gold,
which he gave to Rebecca, when he chose her to be Isaacks Wife, as we may read
in the same Book of Genesis c. 24. versic. 22.
. But the first Ring was not of Gold, but of Iron, adorned with an Adamant
Nevizanus in Silva nuptial. lib. 3. in princ. n. 13. Alberic. and Corsetus ubi
supra, Ille in Dictienario, hic in Repertorio, uterque in verb. Annulus, Alex.
ab. Alex. de die genial. lib. 2. c. 19. page 229.
, the Metal hard and durable, signifying the continuance and perpetuity of the
Contract Corsetus d. verb. Annulus.
; the virtuous Adamant drawing the Iron unto it, signifying the perfect unity
and indissoluble Conjunction of their minds, in true and faithful love unde
antiquum Carmen, Ut ferrum Magnes, sic ad se nos trahit Agnes.
; Howbeit, it skilleth not at this day, what Metal the Ring be; The form of the
Ring being circular, that is, round, and without end, imports thus much, that
their mutual love and hearty affection should roundly flow from the one to the
other, as in a Circle, and that continually, and for ever c. foeminae. 30. q.

Sponsal. secunda. part. c. 4. in princ. n. ibidem 3.
, next unto the little Finger; because by the received Opinion of the Learned
and Experienced in Ripping up, and anatomizing Men's Bodies Appion. in libris
Aegiptiacis. Aulus Gellius lib. etc. 10. Polidor. Virgil. de Invent. lib. 2. c.
21. Plin. lib. 33. c. 1.
, there is a Vein of Blood which passes from that fourth Finger unto the
Heart, called Vena amoris, Loves Vein c. foeminae 30. q. 5. in fin. Alex. de
die genial. lib. 2. c. 19. fol. 229. Kling. de Causis Matrimonial. fol. 70.
Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. 2. part. c. 4. n. 3.
. And so the wearing of the Ring on that Finger signifies, that the love
should not be vain or fained, but that as they did give their Hands each to
other, so likewise they should give their Hearts also, whereunto that Vein is
extended d. c. foeminae. cum gloss. ibidem Kling. and Nevizanus. ubi supra.
Praepos. in c ultim. de despons. nup. n. 4.
. Furthermore I do observe, that in former Ages it was not tolerated to single
or unmarried Persons to wear Rings, unless they were Judges, Doctors, or
Senators, or such like honorable Persons Alex. ab. Alex. de die genial. lib.
2. c. 19. DD. in c. pen. de vita and hon. cler. extra.
: So that being destitute of such Dignity, it was a note of Vanity,
Lasciviousness, and Pride for them to presume to wear a Ring Hostiens. and alij
in d.c. pen. Lindewood in.c. exterior de vita and hon. cler. lib. 3. provinc.
constable. Cant.
, whereby we may collect how greatly they did honor and reverence the Sacred
Estate of Wedlock in times past, in permitting the Parties affianced to be
adorned with the honorable Ornament of the Ring: As also the Vanity,
Lasciviousness, and intollerarable Pride of these our days, wherein every
skipping Jack, and every flirting Jill, must not only be ring'd (forsooth) very
daintily, but must have some special Jewel or Favor besides, as though they
were descended of some noble House or Parentage, when as all their Houses and
whole Patrimony is not worth the Ninth part of a Noble; or else, as if they
were betrothed or assured in the holy Band of Wedlock, when as indeed, there is
no manner of Contract betwixt them, unless peradventure it be such a Contract
as Judah made with Thamar, that was, that he should lie with her, which bargain
he concluded by delivering her a Ring, and afterward performed the same by
committing Filthiness with her, and begetting her with Child Genes. ^. 38.
.

7. But let these things pass: Come we to the other Observations, and consider,
Whether this Subarration be a sufficient sign or proof of Matrimony or
Spousals? Wherein we are first of all to regard, Whether any words of Matrimony
or Spousals were uttered at the delivery of the Ring, yea or no? If any words
were uttered, the delivery and acceptance of the Ring is no more but a
Confirmation of such a Contract as those words do import Panor. in c. ultim. de
despons. impub. extra. n. 7. and ibi Praepos. n. 4. Lapus allegat. 57. Menoch.
de praesump. lib. 3. praesump. 2. n. 2.
; that is to say, if the words did import Matrimony, the Ring confirms
Matrimony, and if the words did import Spousals only, the Ring betokens no
more but bare Spousals Panor. and Praepos. ubi supra. Hostiens. in Tit. de
Sponsal.. quot sunt species. August. Beronus q. 6. n. 5. Menoch. ubi supra.
; and that not only when the Ring is delivered at the same time of speaking the
words, but at any time after Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. prima part, c. 4.. 2.
n. 2. Innoc. and communiter alii in c. ultim. de despons. impub. contra
Praepos. ibidem.
; and if it be doubtful, whether the words import Matrimony or Spousals, it is
to be judged Matrimony Menoch. de praesump. lib. 3. praesump. 2. n. 12. Caepol.
lib. 1. Consil. civil. n. 14. Berous q. 6. n. 6. circa medium. Praepos. in c.
ultim. de despons. impub. n. 4.
: If also no words were uttered at or before the delivery or acceptance of the
Ring, then we are to respect whether it were delivered in sport, or in earnest?
If in jest, it does not betoken either Matrimony or Spousals Henr. Boic. and
Card. in c. ultim. de despons. impub. extra c. illud. 15. q 1. L. obligationum
substantia.. 1. ad fin. ff. In dubio tamen non censctur quis jocose agere.
Praepos. in d. c. ultim. in fin.
: If in earnest, then the manner of delivery and acceptance thereof, is to be
regarded; for if it were not delivered in solemn manner (as if he did not put
it on her fourth Finger, but gave it her otherwise into her hands) it does not
signify Matrimony Panor. in c. Illud de praesump. n. 12. extra. Praepos. in c.

, no more than when a Man sends a Ring to a Woman by a Messenger, which is
understood to be a Gift or Token of good will, and not a sign of Matrimony or
Spousals Paris. Consil. 55. n. 44. and consil. 60. n. 50. vol. 4. Zas. cons. 4.
n. 31. vol. 2.
. And albeit by the Opinion of some it may seem, that the Ring being delivered
by the Party himself into the Woman's hand, without putting the same on her
Finger, Spousals are thereby presumed to be contracted betwixt them Menoch. de
praesum p. lib. 3. praef. 2. n. 10. Innoc. in c. Tuae. de Spons. extra. Lucas

; yet dare not I deliver this Conclusion for current, as well because in this
Case, it seems rather a Gift or an Argument only of friendly good will, than
an earnest penny of Spousals Paris. cons. 55. n. 44. and consil. 6. n. 50. Zas.

: As also, for that by this means, as by a Bait, many simple Maids might easily
be hooked, e're they were advised, and so contracted before they consented; a
matter no less unreasonable than unlawful c. cum locum de Sponsal. extra. L.
nuptias. de Reg. Jur. ff.
.

8. If the Ring be delivered in solemn Form, and put on the Woman's fourth
Finger, by the Party himself, and she willingly, not only accept the same, but
wear it accordingly; In this Case, by the Opinion of sundry Ancient and
Reverend Writers, it is to be presumed for Matrimony Anto. de Butr. in c.

praesump. extra. n. 12. quem Felinus cod. c. sequurus refert quod Panor.

; whose Opinion the rather may seem to be received, because by the general
Custom of this Realm, and by the Form prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer,
the Man is to give unto the Woman a Ring, and to put it on upon her said Finger
at the time of their Marriage Lib. publ. orat. in Ecclesia Angl. ibi de forma
Solemnizationis Matrimonij.
: For in case there were not any such Custom proved, yet by reason of the said
solemn Subarration, Matrimony is presumed to be contracted betwixt them Panor.
in d. c. illud. n. 12. Praepos. in d. c. ultim. de despons. impub. n. 4. and
Anto. de Butr. ibidem. Arctin. consil.
, (if this former Opinion be true) much more than when as the Custom of the
Country is answerable thereunto Menoch. de praesump. lib. 3. praesump. 2. n 9.

Panor. in c. ultim. de despons. impub. extra. Paris. consil. 55. vol 4. n. 43.
Zas. consil. 4. vol. 2 n. 31.
; howbeit when there is not any such Custom, then I fear the former Opinion is
scarce sound (unless some Speech or Treatise of Matrimony had gone before) not
only because it is encountered by common Opinion Cardinal. in c. ultim. de
despons. Imp. extra. Lapus Alleg. 57. Zas. cons. 4. n. 31. vol. 2. Maschardus

praes. 2. n. 9.
, but also for that certain of the chief of them, which did defend the former
Opinion, do afterward upon better advisement seem to shrink from it, and
cleave to the contrary Panor. qui (in c. illud. d. praesump.) Scriptum
reliquit, quod non probata consuetudine, Annulo per virum posito in mulieris
digito, praesumitur matrimonium; At postea (viz. in c. ultim. de despons.
impub.) scripsit quod si nec verba intercesserunt, nec appareat de
consuetudine, non judicatur pro matrimonio ex immissione Annuli; Idem fere
dicend' de Praeposito. in d. c. ultim.
: And therefore, whereas I have alleged that the Solemnity of the Ring is
usually observed within this Realm at Marriages, forasmuch, as that is true
indeed, when as the Marriage is celebrated in the face of the Church, according
to the Book of Common Prayer, but not at the contracting of Spousals, albeit de
praesenti, for ought I can learn: Therefore the former Opinion is not the
rather to be received by that Allegation, unless the Custom be otherwise
proved, which being proved accordingly, then I esteem it a Case free from all
dangerous Contradiction, that by the Solemn delivery and acceptance of the
Ring, in form aforesaid, the Parties are thereby presumed to have mutually
consented to be Man and Wife, and so to have contracted Matrimony, albeit they
used not any words, nor had any former Treatise sounding of Marriage Panor. in
c. ultim. de despons. impub. extra. n. 7. verse. aut constat de consuetudine,

. Thus much of Subarration, the first and principal sign of Matrimony; of the
other signs, namely, of Traduction, of Cohabitation, and of Entreating each
other as Man and Wife, etc. then shall we speak more fully when we entreat by
what means Matrimony may be proved.

SECT. XVI. Of Spousals confirmed by Oath.
1. SIxthly, Spousals be sometimes contracted without an Oath, and sometimes
they are contracted with Confirmation of an Oath Summa Hostiens. Tit. de
Spons.. quot sunt. Melchior. Kling. Tract. de Cause. Matrimonial. fol. 2. c. 2.
etc. requisivit de Sponsal. extra.
; The former of them are called unsworn Spousals, of which kind are all those
whereof hitherto we have discoursed; The other be termed [ jurata Sponsalia DD.
in c. 2. etc. requisivit de Sponsal. extra. Kling. de Causis. Matrimonial. fol.
2.
Sworn Spousals], concerning the which I find diverse Questions handled.

2. First, whether these Spousals may be dissolved by the mutual Consent of
both the Parties, notwithstanding their Oaths: Wherein, to be brief, It is
flatly resolved that they may c. praeterea.. Si autem de Sponsal. extra.
; So that if a Man and a Woman do swear that they will Marry each other, yet is
it in their power, by mutual Consent to release the Oath, and to dissolve this
Contract Pan. Praepos. and DD. in d. c. praeterea. Covar. tract. de Spon. sal.
1. part. c. 5. in princ. Kling. tract. de cause. Matrimonial. fol. 2.
.

3. Against this decision it is ordinarily objected, That albeit the Parties
have Authority peradventure, to dissolve the Contract, being no more but
Spousals de futuro L. nihil tam natural. de Reg. Jur. ff. d. c. praeterea de
Sponsal. extra.
; Yet it is not in their Power or Authority to violate their Oaths, no more
than it is within the Compass of their Commission to Sin, and to take the name
of the Lord our God in vain Arg. c. vinc. 32. q. ultima.
: And therefore they are by all means and ways to be induced to the Observation
of their Oath c. 2. de Sponsal. extra.
.

4. To this Objection it is diversely answered; some do think that the Parties
do sin herein haec est opinio vulgi Inquit Panor. in d. c. praeterea n. 5. At
qui eand. op. tenuit Hugo ut refert. Felin. eod c.n. 16.
; but yet, lest a greater mischief should follow d.c. praeterea. ibi ne forte
deterius inde contingat, etc.
, and lest their Sin should more and more increase, and still grow greater by
daily disagreement, in case they were compelled to marry against their Wills;
they are tolerated to depart Unde existimarunt Quidam, dissolvi posse quidem
Sponsalia jurata dissensu mutuo, non tamen ex ipsa dispositione Juris communis,
sed ex quadam dispositione comparativa; quasi sine peccato id fieri non potuit,
sed tollcrante Ecclesia ad evitand' majus malum, quae tamen opinio, magis
communiter reprobatur. Quorsum enim inducta fuisset similitudo dissolvendae
Societatis juratae, Si non mero Jure remittatur Juramentum, vide Panor and
Praepos. in d. c. praeterea.
: Others say that the Parties do not Sin in this Case Henr. Boic. Panor.
Praepos. and alij, post Innocent. in d. c. praeterea. de Sponsal.
; But that as an unlawful Oath may lawfully be broken c. 1. cum sequen. 22. q.
4. c. non est obligatorium. de Reg. Jur. 6. c. Si vero. de Jure jur. extra.
; So that Oath, which is made for another Man's benefit, being willingly by him
remitted, may thereupon be unperformed Panor. post. Inno. in d. c. praeterea.
n. 6. and Praepos. post. Jo. Andr. and alios in d. c. n. 7. and Felin. n. 13.
and n. 33. Covar. tract. de Sponsal. prima part. c. 5. in princ. ibi, ac si
homo, etc.
, without violation, as well of Gods Law, as of Man's Law: As for Example, a Man
promises and confirms it with an Oath, to pay unto thee x l. at Easter next,
before which day thou do forgive him the Debt; In this case, it is concluded
without Contradiction, that he may without breach of Law, or touch of
Conscience, not pay the x l. Melchior. Kling. Tract. de Causis Matrimonial.
fol. 2. in fin. and fol. 3. in princ. Henr. Boic in c. 1. c. praeterea. de
Spons extra. col. r. in fin. versic. aut non tenentur, etc. Praepos. cod. in c.
n. 5.
. And so they do not distinguish betwixt lawful and unlawful Oaths; but they
make a difference betwixt lawful Oaths, For of these say they, some are made
for Gods Cause Henr. Boic. Panor. and Praepos. in d. c. praeterea. de Spons.
extra.
; as for the advancement of Religion veluti Ecclesiam edificare, auasdam
orationes dicere, etc.
, or amendment of Man's Life Ut Adulteram abjuraret. c. cum haberet de co. q.
dux. in matr.
; and some are made for Man's Cause DD. in d. c. praeterea
, as in the former Example; In the one Almighty God is said to be a Party, in
the other a Witness ibidem.
; Now, not to observe that Oath wherein the Almighty is a Party, it is plainly
confessed by each Party to be a Sin DD. ubi supra. c. vinc. 32. q. ult. c. quod
Deo. 33. q. 5.
: And therefore it is generally holden, that if a Man in respect of piety and
Godly Devotion, swear that he will Marry such a poor Woman, and so contract
Spousals with her, he cannot afterward dissolve this Contract, though she
would also consent thereunto Praepos. in d. c. praeterea. n. 8. and Panor.
ibidem in fin.
: But not to perform the Oath whereunto God is a Witness only, when it is
remitted by the Party, in whose only favor and sole benefit it was made, is no
Sin, say they Henr. Boic. in d. c. and ibi Panor. Anto praepos. And. and alij.
; and so when a Man and a Woman, not of Religion, but of affection, do swear,
that they will marry together, the Oath being mutually remitted, the Contract
may very well be not performed DD. in d. c. praeterea.
: Marry, whether this be good Divinity or not, I know not; For there be diverse
Cases delivered in Law wherein this Rule [Jusjurandum serva] may be broken, for
which there is but little Warrant out of Gods Word; And therefore I refer this
Question to the determination of the Godly and Learned Divines: But howsoever
the Case may seem to stand clear in respect of the Laws, either Humane or
Divine, forasmuch as it needs must be scandalous to the Church and
Congregation, that a Christian Man, and a Christian Woman, having sworn to
marry together, should not perform their Vows in so serious a Cause, and so
Godly an Action Vide Gloss. final. in c. praeterea. de Sponsal. extra.
, the Parties are by all means to be urged to the performance of this their
Oath and promise c. ex literis. el. 2. de Sponsal. extra.
; But if they will not be admonished, but do obstinately resist d. c.
praeterea. Si autem.
, then indeed, lest a worse thing should betide them, by reason of their mutual
hatred, the Law does permit them to depart, and dissolve the Contract d. c.
praeterea in fin.
.

5. But what if the one of the Parties contracted in manner aforesaid be
willing, and the other unwilling, whether does the single dissent of the one
Party dissolve the Contract, or whether is the dissenting Party to be compelled
to marry the other willing Party? To the former part of the question, it is
generally concluded by all Interpreters, as well of the Civil, as of the Canon
Law; That it is not in the power of either Party alone, without the Consent of
the other to renounce or dissolve the Spousals confirmed with an Oath Legiftae
in I. 1. C de Sponsal. Canonistae in c. requisiv it de Sponsal. extra.
: Indeed if the Spousals were not contracted with confirmation of an Oath, by
the Civil Law, either Party might renounce such unsworn Spousals; and
afterward marry elsewhere, without any danger or fear of punishment L. 1. de
Sponsal. and Arris. C. and Sishardus ibidem. ^. ^. tamen patitur poenam
arrarum. L. ultim. eod.
: Because Spousals are not Matrimony, but a preamble or preparation thereunto
Sichard. in L. 1. de Spons. C. n. 6.
; and the Civilians do think that the Canon Law is not contrary to the Civil
Law in this point Gloss. Cyn. and Sichard. in d. L. 1.
; howbeit the Canonists for the most part are of another Opinion Panor. in c.
requisivit. de Spons extra. n. 6. Nic. Everard. consil. 178. n. 7. ubi refert
quod licet Sponsalia non sunt jurata, tamen ad illorum Solemnizationem and
observationem, Sponsa ab initio voluntaria, and postea renitens, and invita
compelli potest nisi urgentissima Causa supervenerit vel subsit, and quod ita
tenent communiter DD.
, because by their Law, Ex nudo pacto oritur Actio c. 1. de pactis extra. and
ibi DD. Panor. in c. requisivit. de Spons. n. 6. verse. In contrarium, etc. and
in c. ex literis el. 2. n. 3. Summa Hostiens. Tit. de Sponsal.. quis sit.
effectus. n. 9
; And therefore they conclude that the one espoused Party, cannot renounce the
Spousals or dissolve the Contract, albeit unsworn Panor. in d. c. requisivit.
Everard. consil. 178. n. 7.
, without the Consent of the other Vide Henr. Boi. in c. requisivit. de Spons.
extra. and Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. 1. part. c. 4. n. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
; Indeed this is a clear Case, even by the Canon Law, that if the one espoused
Party do (as they term it) de facto contract perfect Matrimony with some other
Person, the second Contract prevails, albeit, the Spousals had been confirmed
with an Oath c. sicut. etc. si inter de Sponsal. extra.
, otherwise not: For the second part of the question, at least, without just
and urgent Cause Everard. d. cons. 178. quod videto. Covar. tract. de Spons. 1.
part c. 4. n. 2, 3, etc.
, whether the unwilling Party may be compelled to marry the other, willing
according to their mutual promise, confirmed by Oath; There be two several
Texts, which at the first sight seem contrary the one to the other, The former
affirming that the unwilling Party may be compelled c. ex literis. cl. 2. de
Sponsal. extra.
, the second pronouncing that the Party is rather to be admonished c.
requisivir. de Spons. extra.
; For the reconciliation of which two places diverse distinctions have been
devised Gloss. and DD. in d. c. ex literis.
. First, that the former Text is true by the rigor of the Law; the second by
the mercy and equity thereof Gloss. in d. c. ex literis. verb. compellas. in
princ. Arg. c. praetera eod. Tit. ne, viz. deterius inde contingat.
. Next, that the former Text proceeds not simply, but conditionally; and that
the second Text has place, if otherwise the Party cannot be made willing d.
gloss. arg. c. Vides 23. q.
. Thirdly, that the former Text proceeds simply, and that the Party is to be
compelled precisely by reason of the Oath Praealleg. gloss. Arg. c. Sacerdotes
etc. Ecce Crimina. 24. q. 3.
; and that the later Text is thus to be expounded, the word [potius, rather] is
to be turned into [prius, first] d. gloss. in fin.
; and so where it is there said, that the Party is rather to be monished than
compelled, the Sense is, the party is first to be monished, and then compelled
praeall. gloss. quam sequitur Gubertus ^ostanus, Tract. de Sponsal. fol. 32. n.
5.
; thus they go about to reconcile the two places: But the true and common
approved reconciliation is this; either there is just Cause of refusal, or not
Henr. Boic. in c. requisivit. de Sponsal. extra. and ibi Panor. n. 4. Praepos.
in c. ex literis. cl. 2. eod. n. 8. quam distinctionem DD. commumter probant,
ut per Praepos. ibidem.
; if there be just Cause already ministered, as if the other party have
committed Fornication Praepos. in c. ex literis. el. 2. n. 8.
, or be stricken with Leprosy, Palsy, or some notable deformity Vide Melchior.
Kling. Tract. de cause. Matrimonial. fol. 5. in fin.
, or that some impediment have happened Puta Consanguinitatis, vel affinitatis,
etc. gloss. in d. c. ex literis. verb. rationabilis Causa.
, for the which Spousals may be dissolved (whereof hereafter), In this Case the
Party may be monished, but not compelled to the Observation of his Oath Henr.
Boic. Panor. and Praepos. ac communiter DD. in c. requisivit. etc. ex literis.
de Sponsal. extra.
: For in every promise and Action, a just and reasonable Cause is still
excepted Henr. Boic. in d. c. requisivit. Kirkhov. in lib. 2. consil.
Matrimonial. consil. ibidem. 27. n. 23.
, being a secret Condition evermore understood, though never expressed: If
there be not just Cause precedent, then the unwilling Party is to be
admonished; and if he yet obstinately refuse, he Tacitarum Conditionum varia
Exempla, vide apud Olden. in Topicis legal. Loco ab auctoriate fol. 105, 106.

Idem Panor. Consil. 48. vol. 1.
; nor is he or she so refusing, to be absolved, unless there be just Cause of
fear of future mischief, and greater danger like to ensue such hateful
Conjunction (as Murders, Adulteries, and such sad and tragical events) left to
the sound discretion of the. Wise and just Judge, by him to be uprightly
weighed and indifferently balanced Henr. Poic. in c. requisivit. de Sponsal.

absolve the desperate Person Etiam non petenti impendenda est absolutio emnino

public Scandal of the Church Boic and communiter DD. in d. c. requisivit.

.

6. The third Question is this, What if a Man do [swear that he will Marry such
a Woman] which Woman is absent then, and ignorant of his Oath, but afterward
being certified thereof, does ratify and confirm the same, which done, the Man
and the Woman do lie together, whether is this Matrimony or no?

It is answered that it is Praepos. in c. ex literis. el. 2. de Despons. extra.
n. 4. verse. sed opportune, etc.
, because by the presumption of Law Spousals are translated into Matrimony, by
carnal Copulation c. is qui fidem de Sponfal. extra.
; howbeit the aforesaid Conclusion is then understood to be true, in Case the
Man did continue and persevere in the same mind, until the Woman did also
consent, without repentance, or revocation in the mean time, otherwise not
Praepos. ubi supra.
; as heretofore has been disputed at large.

7. The last Question shall be this, a Man does promise and swear unto the
three Daughters of such a Person, that he will Marry one of them, wherewith
they are content; Afterward he lies with one of them, whether are these two
hereby made Man and Wife, yea, or no? It may seem they are not, because they
had not contracted Spousals before they did lie together Gloss. in c. ex
literis. el. 2. de Spons. and Inno ibidem
; And that appears by this, Until that time it was in his choice to have
married any one of all the three Daughters whomsoever; seeing then he might
lawfully have married any one of all the three, it follows that he had not
contracted Spousals, otherwise he could not have married any one of them whom
he would; wherefore no Spousals being first contracted Nimirum prepter publicae
honestatis Justiciae impedimentum c. 1. de Sponsal. in Sext.
, no Matrimony can follow, by their only lying together, or knowing each other
carnally Gloss. in d. c. ex. literis. quam sequuntur Inno. Anto. Henr. and
Praepos.
.

8. Nevertheless, by the common Opinion, the Law presumes Matrimony to be
contracted betwixt the said Parties in this Case Hostiens. and Panor. in d. c.
ex literis. Silvestr. Prier. verb. Matrimonium el. 2. q. 11. Covar. tract. de

; for seeing he was bound to marry one of them three Nam cum licitum sit
Juramentum, tenetur illud implere, Saltem ex officio Judicis, licet aliquam
dictarum mulierum nondum cognovisset. c. Si vero, de Jurejur. extra. Henr.

, he is presumed to have made choice of her for his Wife, with whom he had to
do, as with his Wife Hostiens. and Panor. in d. c. ex literis. Covar. and
Menoch. ubi supra.
; for if a Man contract Spousals conditionally with a Woman, these are
uncertain Spousals, so long as the Condition is in suspense; and yet
nevertheless, if in the mean time he have access to her, as to his Wife, these
doubtful Spousals do thereby pass into Matrimony Covar. tract. de Sponsal.

condic. appos. extra. Menoch. de praesump. lib. 3. praes. 2. n. 14.
; and so in the question proposed, albeit the Spousals be uncertain, yet their
lying together does make the same uncertain Spousals, to become Matrimony,
as well as in the former Case Covar. and Menoch. in locis praealleg.
.

9. Again, that favorable Presumption is to be preferred in all doubtful
Cases, whereby Sin and Wickedness may be avoided Panor, in d. c. ex literis el.
2. n. 7. de Sponsal. c. Estote de Reg. jur. extra.
: Now to presume that these two Persons had any other purpose in dealing
together, than that which is agreeable to the Office and Duty of Husband and
Wife, were to presume both Adultery and Perjury Panor. ubi supra.
; and therefore this sinful Presumption is to be rejected, and the contrary
received Ibidem.
: Where it is said on the other side, that there was not any precedent Contract
of Spousals betwixt them two, and therefore no subsequent Matrimony to be
presumed, by reason of their lying together; The Antecedent is to be denied
Covar. de Sponsal. 1. part. c. 4.. 1. n. 17. Menoch. de praesump. lib. 3.
praes. 2. n. 14.
: For seeing by his promise and Oath he was bound to marry one of them three
Covar. and Menoch. in locis praed.
, Certain it is, that he for his part had contracted Spousals, though
uncertain; and on the other side the three Sisters they are likewise deemed
every one of them to have consented, that she should be his Wife, whom he would
choose Hostiens. in c. ex literis. el. 2. de Sponsal. extra. and Praepos.
ibidem. n. 6.
. So that for their parts, there is also Spousals contracted, and so on both
parts, though as yet uncertain; Which uncertain Spousals become Matrimony by
carnal Copulation c. super eo. etc. per tuas. de Spons. extra.
, as is aforesaid. If any do reply, that he could not contract Spousals with
three Sisters; True it is, that he cannot contract Spousals with three Women at
once, (as I promise to marry you three) neither yet with three Sisters at
several times; for being first espoused to one of them, by the Canon Law, he is
forbidden to contract Spousals with any of the rest; albeit, the first contract
were void d. c. primo. in princ.
, by reason of the impediment of the Justice of public honesty, whereof
elsewhere: But if he promise to marry one of them three only, whom he shall
choose, and they agree thereunto, this Contract is not unlawful Hostiens. and
DD. communiter in. c. ex literis. el. 2. de Sponfal. extra.
, for here each of them is presumed to consent conditionally, if he shall choose
her to be his Wife Praepos. in d. c. ex literis. n. 6.
: In which Case if he lie with any one of them, he is presumed to have made
choice of her for his Wife, and so to have purified the Condition Praepos.
post. Hostiens. and Panor. in d. c. ex literis.
; And such is our Case: Wherefore by the received Opinion, the uncertain
Spousals are made Matrimony by succeeding Copulation Hostiens. Panor. Prier.
Covar. Menoch. and alij locis praealleg.
: Which Conclusion has place, when as he does promise to marry incertam ex
certis, an uncertain Woman of a certain Company, as in the former instance; but
not when as he does promise to marry, incertam ex incertis, an uncertain Woman
of an uncertain Company; As for Example, A Man does promise and swear to marry
one of the Subjects of such a Prince; for albeit he do afterward lie with one
of them, yet is not this Matrimony Praepos. in c. ex literis. el. 2. de
Sponsal. extra. n. 5. in fin. and ibi Panor. n. 7. in fin.
, because he may notwithstanding marry another of them Panor. and Praepos. ubi
supra.
; but when he does lie with one of the Sisters, he cannot afterward marry
another of the Sisters, because of the affinity newly sprung up, by having
Carnal knowledge of one of them before Hostiens. Panor. and Praepos. in d. c.

SECT. XVII. Of the Effects of Spousals.
1. Diverse are the effects of Spousals, whereof the first and principal is
this; The Parties which have contracted Spousals together, are bound by the
Laws Ecclesiastical of this Realm, to perform their promise, and to celebrate
Matrimony together accordingly Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. 1. part c. 4. in
princ. Lindwood in c. Statutum verb. Soluturum. de testa. lib. 3. provinc.
constit. Lancelot. lib. 2. Instit. jur. can. tit. de Sponsal.. initiatum
Costan. de Sponsal. fol. 32. and nu. 2.
: Which Conclusion is both extended and restrained, as may appear by the
Ampliations and Limitations following.

2. The first Ampliation is this, that not only they which do contract Spousals
de praesenti, but also they which do contract Spousals de futuro, are bound to
the performance thereof c. de illis el. 1. de despons. impub. extra. and ibi
Panor. and in c. ex literis. el. 2. de Sponsal. and ibi DD.
.

3. Secondly, the affianced Parties are bound to the performance of the
Contract; Albeit the same were made without an Oath c. de illis el. 1. de
Despons. impub. extra. ubi hoc notat. Abb. Hostiens. and Henr. Idem Covar.
Tract. de Sponsal. 1. part. c. 4. in princ. nu. 2.
.

4. Thirdly, Albeit one of the Parties affianced do afterward also contract
Spousals with another Person, and confirm the same with an Oath, yet is the
first, though unsworn Contract, to be performed Jo. And. Abb. and Praepos. in
c. sicut de Sponsal. Covar. ubi supra. quem videto.
.

5. Fourthly, not only they which have contracted Spousals are bound to perform
the same, but they also which do promise, that they will contract Spousals
Covar. tract. de Sponsa. 1. part c. 4. in princ. per L. fi fidejussor..
meminisse. ff. de leg. 1. and per. L. Si quis Stipulatus sit Stichum.. ultim.
de verb. oblig. ff. Nich. Boer. decis. 13. n. 3
.

6. Fifthly, the Parties, having contracted Spousals de praesenti, albeit, the
one Party should afterward marry another Person, in the face of the Church,
and should Consummate the same by Carnal Copulation, and Procreation of
Children, notwithstanding the first Contract is good, and shall prevail against
the second Marriage c. Si inter. de Sponsal. extra.
.

7. The Limitations of the former Conclusion are these. First, where the
Parties espoused were not of Ripe Age at the time of the Contract; for coming
to years of consent, they may lawfully dissent without danger c. de illis. cl.
1. de despons. impub. extra.
.

8. Secondly, when as the Spousals be conditional, the Condition not being
performed, the Parties are not bound to marry together c. 1.. ultim. de
Sponsal. in Sext. c. super eo de Condic. appos. extra.
, unless the Condition be impossible, or unhonest, as has been before declared
Supra. 12.
.

9. Thirdly, when as either Party having contracted Spousals de futuro, does
afterward Contract Matrimony or Spousals de praesenti, with another Person c.
sicut. etc. Si inter.. ultim de Sponsal extra.
; or else contract Spousals de futuro with another Person, and then they lie
with the same Person Jo. And. and Butr. in c. is qui fidem de Spons. extra.
Menoch. de Praes. lib. 3. Praes. 2. n. 17.
; For in both these Cases the former Spousals are dissolved by the later.

10. Finally, when as the Spousals be unlawful Summa Hostiens. Tit. de
Sponsal.. quis. sir effectus. in princ. ibi and Menoch. tract. de Praesump.
lib. 3. praes. 2. n. 27. Sichard. in L. 1. C. de Sponsal. n. 16, 17, 18.
, whether it be by reason of impediment in the Person, (for that they be of kin
or allied within the Degrees prohibited) or for want of Consent (as by occasion
of fear, furor, drunkenness, etc.) in these and the like Cases Spousals are
destitute of effect quod enim nullum est, executionem aut effectum non meretur.
L. 4.. condemnatum. de re. jud. ff. add Pan. in c. Is qui fidem de Sponsal.

d. Praes. 2. n. 27. Sichard. in L. 1. C. de Sponsal. n. 16, 17, 18.
.

11. The second effects is, that Spousals de futuro do become Matrimony by
carnal knowledge, betwixt the Parties betroathed c. Is qui fidem de Sponsal.
extra. Menoch. tract. de praesump. lib. 3. praes. 2. n. 6. Melchior. Kling. de
cans. Matrimonial. fol. 5.
; The Ampliations of which Conclusion are these.

12. First, albeit either Party betroathed should afterward marry another
Person in the face of the Church, and should also lie with the said new married
Person; Yet this Marriage solemnized and consummate notwithstanding, the Party
so marrying is to be compelled to return to his or her foresaid Spouse,
formerly known Eod. c. id. qui etc. veniens. de Sponsal. extra.
.

13. Secondly, albeit the Parties betroathed should protest before the Act
done, that they did not intend thereby, that the Spousals should become
Matrimony, yet this protestation is overthrown by the fact following c. per
tuas. de condic. appos. extra. and ibi gloss. Panor. and alij Covar. Tract. de.
Sponsal. 1. part. c. 4.. 1. n. 18.
; for by lying together, they are presumed to have swarved from their former
unhonest protestation Gloss. in d. c. per tuas. and ibi Panor. n. 6. de Condic.
app. extra.
; And so the former Spousals are now presumed honest Matrimony Panor. in d. c.
per tuas Covar. ubi supra. Menoch. Tract. de praesump. lib. 3. Prees. 2. n. 15.
.

14. Thirdly, albeit, he or she which did contend that Matrimony was
contracted, should after the deed done confess, that they did not thereby
intend to make Matrimony; yet so strong is the presumption of Law Est enim
praesumptio non juris tantum, sed juris and de jure. Gloss. communiter recepta.
in d. c. is qui fidem. Abb. and Felin. in c. quanto de praesump. Alciat. tract.
de praesump. in princ. n. 8.
, in favor of Matrimony, as this Confession does not work any thing against it
Abbas Praepos. and alij in d. c. is qui fidem. de Spous. extra. Covar. tract.
de Sponsal. 1. part. c. 4.. 1. n. 3. ubi fatetur hanc opinionem esse com. a
qua tamen ipse postea recedit. ibidem. n. 4.
.

15. Fourthly, albeit, one of the Parties betroathed should commit Fornication,
yet if after this Crime committed, the said Parties formerly betroathed shall
know each other carnally, the said Crime does not hinder the passage of the
Spousals into Matrimony Gloss. in c. de illis. el. 1. de despons. impub. Henr.
Boic. and Praepos. in c. de illis. de Spons. extra. Mencch. tract. de praesump.
lib. 3. praes. 2. n. 18.
, seeing the same Spousals were not dissolved, but dissoluble by occasion of
Fornication Menoch. ubi supra. post. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. 1. part, c. 4..
1. n. 8.
.

16. Fifthly, albeit the Woman were betroathed against her Will, yet if she
suffer her self to be known by him, to whom she was espoused, she is presumed
to have consented unto him, as unto her Husband c. Significavit de eo qui dux.
in matr. quam poll. etc. Insuper. qui matr. accus. poss.
, whereby the Spousals are made Matrimony d. c. Significavit. Menoch. Tract. de
praesump. lib. 3. praes. 2. n. 21. and praes. 4. in fin.
.

17. Sixthly, albeit, the Woman be uncertain; As if a Man do swear to three
Sisters, that he will marry one of them; for by lying with one of them, those
Spousals become Matrimony Hostiens. and Panor. in c. ex literis. el. 2. de
Spons. extra. Menoch. de praesump. lib. 3. praes. 2. n. 13.
: As heretofore I have confirmed Supra.. prox.
.

18. Seventhly, Spousals de futuro, be come Matrimony by carnal Copulation,
albeit either party had first contracted Spousals with some other Persons Jo.
And. and Butr. in c. is qui fidem. de Sponsal. extra. Menoch. Tract. de
praesump. lib. 3. praes. 2. n. 17. Silvestr. Prier. in Summa. verb. Sponsalia.
q. 10. Covar. tract. de Sponsal. 1. part. c. 4.. 1. n. 10.
.

19. Eighthly, Spousals do become Matrimony by carnal knowledge, albeit the Man
were constrained, through fear of death to know the Woman Hostiens. in d. c. is
qui fidem fecit, Covar, tract de Sponsal. 1. part. c. 4.. 1. n. 11. ratio quam
ibi assignat haec est, illa etiam Copula, si fornicario affectu peracta fucrit,
etiam metu acerrimo, peccatum^erit mortale, Id quod praesumi non debet in
Sponso, sed potius, secluso metu, affectum habuisse conjugalem; praeterea
coeunte viro, exclusus est metus, quia si interfuisset metus, cessaret coeundi
desiderium, sine quo frustra adhiberetur coeundi conatus. Covar. ubi supra and
Menoch. tract. de praesump. lib. 3. praes. 4. n. 33.
.

20. Finally, albeit the Man do by violence carry away the Woman, with whom he
has contracted Spousals, and have to do with her, hereby Spousals are become
Matrimony Paul. de Castr. in L. Raptores, C. de Epis. and cler. n. 3. per. c.
pen. de. rapt. extra. Menoch. de praesump. lib. 3. praes. 2. n. 23.
.

21. The Limitations of the former Conclusions are these: First, when as it
does appear that the Spousals were dissolved, either by mutual Consent, or by
some other lawful means (whereof mention is made in the next Paragraph) before
the Parties did lie together, for dissolved Spousals do never become Matrimony,
albeit the Parties do afterward know each other Menoch. de praesump. lib. 3.
praes. 2. n. 26. Panor. in c. per tuas de cond. app. extra. Sichard in L. 1. de
Spons. C. n. 4. in fin.
; And so it is, if the Spousals were void from the beginning, by reason of any
just Impediment, as of Consanguinity or Affinity within the Degrees prohibited,
or such like Menoch. d. praesump. 2. n. 27. Panor. in c. Is qui fidem.
deSponsal. extra. n. 5. verse. Secus si, etc. Praepos. in c. de illis de cond.
app. n. 4. verse. and sic notate, etc.
.

22. Secondly, Spousals do not become Matrimony, when as the Parties did lie
together before they were contracted, but not after Panor. in c. veniens. el.
2. de Sponsal. extra. Henr. Boic. in c. Attestationes. ult. col. de despons.
impub. Covar. tract. de Sponsal. 1. part. c. 4. 1. n. 13. contra. Hyppol.
Sing. 500. Ubi citat alios ita tenuisse, qui tamen ita non tenuerunt, ut latius
per Covar. ubi supra.
.

23. Thirdly, if the Parties having contracted Spousals de futuro, do
afterward know each other, but in truth not with that affection, which does
become Man and Wife, but (as Adulterers do) with a beastly purpose only to
satisfy their foul Lusts, in this Case it is not true Matrimony in Conscience;
neither are they Man and Wife before God Panor. in c. is qui fidem. de Sponsal.
extra. n. 5. Covar. tract. de Sponsal. 1. part. c. 4.. 1. n. 9. Socin. consil.
28. vol. 1. Prier. verb. Matrimonium. el. 2. q. 15.
, though it be otherwise in Man's Judgment per loca praealleg.
; because the Law presumes, that the Parties espoused in knowing each other,
had no foul intent of committing Fornication, but an honest affection as is
meet for married Persons Gloss. and DD. in L. Is qui fidem. de Sponsal. extra.
; nor does the Law permit that they should be credited in affirming the
contrary c. Tua nos. de Sponsal. extra. and ibi Panor. and alij Covar. tract.
de Sponsal. 1. part. c. 4.. 1. n. 9.
: Hence is it, that if the one of them should marry another Person, This
Marriage is good indeed before God, but not in the Consistory or judicial place
of Mortal Man Panor. Praepos. and DD. in c. is qui fidem de Sponsal. extra.
Prier. verb. Matrimonium. el. 2. q. 15. Covar. d. c.. 4.1. n. 9.
, whose Sentence is to be directed by the Rules and Precepts of the Law Lib. 4.
Instit. Tit. de Offic. Jud. in princ.
; and therefore if the unmarried Party, with whom Spousals were first
contracted, should commence Suit against the Party precontracted, to solemnize
Matrimony, and to perform the duties of Marriage, notwithstanding the second
Marriage, the Judge were to give Sentence accordingly Panor. and Praepos. in d.
c. is qui fidem.
; and yet in Conscience and before God, the same were unlawful, so that it were
better for the Party convented to endure the Censures Ecclesiastical, than to
undergo that Sentence Praepos. post Vincen. in d.c. is qui fidem. de Spons.
extra. n. 3.
.

24. Fourthly, when as the Parties themselves betroathed, do not verily and
actually know each other, but only endeavor and assay so to do, the Spousals
de futuro are not hereby resolved into Matrimony c. ultim. de Sponsal. extra.
, unless they were Spousals by interpretation of Law only; as when two Children
are contracted by words of present time, for these Spousals are transformed
into Matrimony by sole endeavor, after the Parties have attained to lawful Age
c. Attestationes and ibi Praepos. and Henr. Boic. de Spons. impub. Idem
Praepos. in c. ultim. de Sponsal. extra. n. 3. and ibi Card. n. 2. Paris.
consil. 51. n. 9. cum Seq. vol. 4. and in cons. 62. n. 9. cod. vol.
.

25. The Third effect arising from Spousals is that impediment which is called
publicae honestatis Justitia c. ad audientiam. et c. Sponsam, de Sponfal. and
Matrimonijs. extra. c. 1. de Sponsal. lib 6.
, the Justice of public honesty, whereby either Party having contracted pure
and certain Spousals, albeit only de futuro, are prohibited to marry any of the
others Kinsfolks within the Degrees prohibited; So that the Man is not to marry
any of the Kinswomen of the Woman, with whom he had contracted Spousals,
neither the Woman to marry any of the Kinsmen of the Man, within the Degrees of
Consanguinity prohibited d.c. Ad audientiam. etc. Sponsam, and DD. ibidem.
Sichard. in L. 1. de Sponsal. C. n. 8.
; which impediment of the Justice of public honesty by the Laws
Ecclesiastical, is not only prohibitory, but destructory, that is to say, it
does not only forbid such Marriages to be contracted, but it does destroy the
same being solemnized Panor. in d. c. Sponsam in fin. c. unic. de Sponsal. in
Sext. and ibi Dominic. de S. Gem. and Phil. Franc.
; but whether this impediment be now of force within this Realm of England,
shall appear hereafter.

26. The Fourth effect proceeding from Spousals, is the penalty whereunto the
Party is Subject, which does revolt from performance of the promise of future
Marriage, which penalty by reason of many Laws is manifold: By the Civil Law,
whosoever having contracted Spousals de futuro, does, without just Cause,
refuse to deduce the same Spousals into Matrimony, does not only lose the token
(which is commonly a Ring) given to the other Party in pledge, and earnest of
the Contract L. Contractus.. illud C. de fide Instr. L. 3. C. de Sponsal.
Sichard. in L. is de don. ante nup. C.
, together, with all other gifts whatsoever simply bestowed in hope of future
Marriage Sichard. in Rub. de don. ante nup. n. 8. and 9. ubi etiam videre licet
Doctrinam inter donationem propter nuptias, and Sponsalitiarum largitatem.
; but is bound to make twofold Restitution for the tokens and pledges received
in Confirmation of the said Contract L. ultim. C. de Sponsal. Quod verum quidem
est, Si modo sit major 25 annis, sin vero minor, tunc solum tenetur ad Arras
quas recepit. eodd.
, whether they be Rings, Braceletts, Jewels, or other things, not consisting in
weight, number or measure Arrae vero dari possunt, non solum in rebus quae
numero, pondere, and mensura consistunt, ut quae facillime duplicari possunt,
verum etiam in Speciebus vel Corporibus, quae licet multiplicari non possunt,
tamen aestimatio erit loco Corporis, and it a accipiens, in Arram, sundum, si
resiliat absque Causa tenebitur restituere sundum, and deinde aestimationem,
and haec opinio communis est contra Bar. rest Sichardo in L. 1. C. de Sponsal.
n. 14 and 15.
, the which the Civil Law does call Arrabo L. Arris and L. ultim. C. de Sponsal.
, being as it were the earnest penny, whereby any bargain is knit up, and fully
concluded betwixt the Parties DD. in d. L. Arris and L ultim.
; but if the Marriage did not proceed, and yet the Party is in no fault
(whether it were by reason of Death or of Prohibition by the Superior
Magistrate, or of new affinity overtaking them within the Degrees prohibited:)
In this Case those gifts conferred in hope of Marriage, were not lost, but
might be recovered L. cum veterum de donac. ante nup. C. and ibidem Sichard.
; yet with this difference, that is to say, if the Woman betroathed, receiving
those gifts, did bestow a Kiss upon her future Husband, then might she retain
the one half thereof L. si a Sponso de don. ante nup. C.
, otherwise he might recover the whole Eod. L. Si a Sponso.
; for so religious, or rather so ridiculous were the Italians and Spaniards in
this point, that they thought her half known if once she kissed a Man Anto.
Gubert. Co. stan. tract. de Sponsal. n. 12, 13. c. nec. in aliqua 27. q. 1.
; And so impatient is the Jealousy of those Husbands (though very unchaste
themselves) that (for the most part) they account it half Adultery if any other
do but kiss their Wives Unde Ov idius, Oscula si dederis, fiam manifestus
amator. Et alibi. Et dicam haec mea sunt, Inisciamque manus, Oscula qui
sumpsit, si non and caetera sumpsit, Haecquoque quae sumpsit pe dear dignus
erat.
; and it is severely punished as a grievous offense, if any do so Gubertus ubi
supra. Baldin c. tuae de procur. extra. gloss. in L. 1. de Extraord. crim. and
in c. nec oportet 81. distinct. Text. in c. 1. Quibus mod. feud. amitt. Alciat.
lib. 4. perergon. c. 10.
. Wherefore seeing amongst them she is thought to be half defloured which
kisseth a Man, no marvel if she retain half those gifts, which otherwise she
should have retained wholly, if she had wholly surrendered the full possession
of her Body into his power Intellige dona simplicia, quae alias
Sponsalitiaelargitatis nomine comprehendantur; sequutis namque nuptijs usque
adeo valet hujusmodi donatio, ut soluto postea Matrimonio, res donata non venit
restituenda viro, utcunque diversum obtineat in donatione, quae dicitur propter
nuptias. Sichard. in Rub. and in L. 1. C. de donatione, an. nup. vide Perkins
tit. Feofments. fol. 40. n. 195.
: But the Civil Law in this respect is of no more force with us in England,
than it is with them in France, of whose natures and Conditions, not varying
herein from the manners and Customs of this Country, Guibertus Costaneus
Senator of Tholosse does write in these Terms; Apud Gallos urbanitatis officij
and Salutationis ergo, viri and mulieris oscula vicissim praebent, etiamsi
nulla Cognationis vel Affinitatis gradu se contingant; Ergo propter solam
osculationem, nihil apud nos lucrari debet Sponsa; alioquin ab omnibus, qui
officij vel urbanitatis causa disponsatam mulierem oscularentur, ea posset
aliquid eo nomine petere, quod est prorsus ridiculum; valiant igitur illae
leges, quae nulla ratione apud nos sustineri possunt, and apud Italos, Hispanos
and alios qui invisam osculationem habent, vim suam obtineant Tract. de
Sponsal. fol. 35. n. 13.
: With the French (says he) Men and Women do kiss together in argument of
Curtesy, Duty and Salutations, although they be not within any Degree of
Consanguinity or Affinity; And therefore the betroathed Woman ought to gain
nothing for a Kiss only; otherwise she might in that respect demand somewhat of
every one, which for Duties or Courtesies sake, should kiss her, being
affianced, which is very ridiculous. Farewell therefore those Laws, the which by
no reason can be sustained with us; and let them prevail with the Italians,
Spaniards, and others which envy kissings, etc. Wherefore by the Laws of this
Realm, what the Woman receives in Consideration of future Marriage; in case
the same Marriage do not succeed, she is either wholly to restore, or wholly to
retain, according to the variety of the Covenants and Conditions concluded upon
betwixt the Parties D. Smith in tract. de republic. Angl. l. 1.3. c. 6. in fin.
vide Perkins. Tit. Feosment fol. 40. n. 194, 195.
; nor does the kissing or not kissing make any difference therein: And if it
fall out, that she be in fault, yet is she not tied to make double restitution
Id quod plus est quam manifestum per totum regnum Anglia.
; albeit the things were given and received as tokens and pledges of the
Contract, which the Civil Law terms Arra; And so it is if the Man be in fault.

27. By Laws Ecclesiastical of this Realm, if any having contracted Spousals,
and being convented and adjudged to celebrate Matrimony accordingly, do refuse
to undergo the Execution of the Sentence pronounced by the Ecclesiastical
Judge; after lawful admonition given in that behalf, he or she so refusing may
for his or Contumacy or disobedience therein, be Excommunicated c. ex literis.
el. 2. de Sponsal. extra. and ibi Praepos. n. 3. in fin. c. 1. de Spons. duorum
and ibi Panor c. sicut ex literis. and ibi DD. de Spons. Gubert. Costanus
tract. de Sponsal. soh 32. n. 2. c. Juramenti 22. q. 5.

.

28. Other effects there be of Spousals, whereof some respect the Issue or
Children begotten before Celebration of the Marriage, betwixt those which have
contracted Spousals; and some have relation to their Lands and Goods.
Concerning their Issue, true it is, that by the Canon Law, the same is lawful
c. per tuas. Qui filij sunt legitimi extra and Panor. super eod. c.n. 4. and
Praepos. n. 7.
: But by the Laws of this Realm their Issue is not lawful, though the Father
and the Mother should afterward celebrate Marriage in the face of the Church
Stat. Merton. c. 9. an 20. H. 3. Tract. de repub. Angl. page 103. prope fin.
and page 104. circa princ.
. Likewise concerning Lands by the Canon Law, the foresaid Issue may inherit
the same d.c. per tuas. qui fill. sunt legit.. nos autem and ibi. DD.
; for further declaration whereof the Canonists tell us, how the Children of
Jacob which he had by his Handmaids, did inherit the Land with their lawful
Brethren c. recurrat. 32. q. 4.. Juvenis.
, by reason Jacob did afterward marry their Mothers Gloss. in c. non omnis 32.
q. 2. Jason consil. 234. post eandem gloss.
: But it is otherwise by the Laws of this Realm, for as the Issue is not
legitimated by subsequent Marriage, no more can he inherit his Fathers Land;
and as he cannot inherit, no more is she to have any Dower of the same Lands;
for whereas by the Laws of this Realm, a married Wife is to have the third part
of her Husbands Lands, holden in Fee Simple or Fee Tail, either General or
Special, for her Dower, after her Husbands Death, during her Life, So that she
be above the Age of nine Years, at her Husbands Death Littleton. Tit. Dower. in
princ.
; Yet a Woman having contracted Matrimony, if the Man to whom she was
betroathed dye before the Celebration of the Marriage, she cannot have any
Dower of his Lands, because as yet, she is not his lawful Wife, at least to
that effect M. 10. H. 3. Perkins. fol. 61.
: Indeed it was sometimes holden for Law within this Realm of England, that if
a Man affianced to a Woman, did carnally know her, and then make a Feoffment to
the same Woman of a piece of Land, and give her seizin thereof, and after that
Marry her in the face of the Church; this Feoffment was void Perkins fol. 40.
n. 195. Mich. 16. Ed. 3.4. Feof. 117.
, as being made unto his own Wife, to whom he had given his Faith, and whom he
had carnally known, he and she being both one Person in Law Perkins ibidem.
; which thing also is agreeable to the Civil Law, and to the Canon Law also,
whereby the donations which are forbidden betwixt the Husband and Wife, are
interpreted likewise to be forbidden betwixt them which have contracted
Spousals de praesenti, or which having contracted Spousals de futuro, do
afterward lie together, whereby those Spousals are reputed Matrimony L. Scita.
and L. cum. hic status.. penult. ff. de donar. inter virum and uxorem. Peckius

hijs qui no. infam. Panor. Praepos. and Felin. in Rub. de Spons. extra.
. But afterward the Temporal Lawyers of this Realm were of another Opinion,
than they were in former times: And whereas long ago, they did seem to hold
that the Feoffment was not good, as being made to his own Wife Mich. 16. Ed.
3.4. Perkins fol. 40. n. 195.
, now they do hold that it is good, as being made, not unto his Wife, but unto
a single Woman, and another Person in Law Mich. 15. Ed. 4.3. Perkins ubi supra.
: But a single Woman cannot have any Dower, as aforesaid; and therefore a Woman
contracted only to a Man, cannot have any dower of his Lands.

29. Concerning Goods, the like may be said of them as has already been spoken
of Lands, that is to say, that although by the Civil and Canon Laws, where the
Man does gain any of the Woman's Goods, or the Woman gain any of the Man's Goods,
by reason of Marriage. Spousals de praesenti or de futuro, consummate with
Carnal knowledge, have the same effect as has Matrimony Solemnized Bar. in L.
nihili interest. n. 1. ff. rer. amot. Castrens. in L. Si marito. Si pater. n.

hanc opinionem veriorem, and equitati magis consentaneam, and in practica
servand.
; yet by the Laws of this Realm it is otherwise: So that neither Spousals de
praesenti, neither Spousals de futuro consummate, do make her Goods his, or his
Goods hers Tract. de repub. Angl. page 103. circa finem.
: And hence it is, that a Woman contracted in Matrimony, dying before the
celebration of the Marriage, may make her Testament, and dispose of all her
Goods, at her own pleasure Perkins fol. 40.38. Ed. 3.12.
, which after Solemnization of the Marriage she cannot do, without his license

SECT. XVIII. By what means Spousals are dissolved.
1. ALbeit Spousals de praesenti are as indissoluble as perfect Matrimony
solemnized and consummate c. Si inter de Sponsal extra. and ibi Cardinal.
Panor. Praepos. and alij Moraldus tract. de Matrimonio, fol. 29.
; yet there be diverse Cases wherein Spousals de futuro either be dissolved ipso
Jure, or at least may be dissolved Sententia Judicis c. c. de Sponsal. extra.
.

2. The First Case is, when the Parties do mutually agree betwixt themselves to
dissolve the Contract; for then they are not to be compelled to marry together,
lest a worse thing happen unto them Eod. c. 2.
: Which conclusion is true, unless by lying together and knowing one another,
or by some other aequivalent Act, the same Spousals were made Matrimony, before
they did agree to dissolve the Contract, for then it is indissoluble c. Is qui
de Sponsal. extra. and DD. ibidem Schneidwin. tract. de imp. fol. 20.
.

3. The Second Case is, when as a certain time is set down for the Marriage;
for that day being past, the Spousals are dissolved c. sicut ex literis. cum
ibi notat. de Spons. extra Melchior Kling. Tract. de Causis Matrimonial. fol.
6. quod intellige nisi tempus apponatur ad implend', non ad finiend'
obligationem, veluti quando dies apponitur ex post facto, Sponsalibus pure
contractis.
; and that Party by whom it did not stand, wherefore the Contract was not
performed, may marry elsewhere, without any danger; but the other Party which
was in fault is punishable, propter laesionem fidei Silvestr. Prier. in Summa
verb. Sponsalia q. 10. versic. 5. per d.c. sicut ex literis.
.

4. The third Case is, when as the Party has been long absent, that is to say
three Years, without the Province L. secunda C. de repudijs c. de illis de
Sponsal. extra. Covar. Tract. de Sponsal. 1. part c. 5. n. 7.
, or two Years within the Province Lib. 2. C. de Sponsal. dd. in d. c. de illis.
; for after lapse of so long time the other party may marry, but not in the
mean time L. 2. de repud. L. 2. de Sponsal. C. c. de illis de Sponsal. extra.
; and if the absence be necessary, and upon a just impediment, then longer
expectation is necessary L. Saepe ff. de Sponsal.
, unless the Ordinary, to avoid the peril of Fornication, grant License to
marry with some other Arg. c. ultim. de eo qui cogno. ux. Covar. tract. de
Sponsal. 1. part. c. 5. n. 7. Schneid. de nuptijs fol. 20.
.

5. The Fourth Case is, when as the Contract is conditional, and the Condition
infringed c. de illis de condic. appos. extra. Kling. de Cause. Matrimonial.
fol. 6.
; for the Condition being broken, the Bond is untyed, and the Parties at
liberty to marry elsewhere d. c. de illis and ibi Panor. and alii.
; or when as the Party does promise to give so much in Marriage, as afterward
he is not able to perform; In which Case the other Party is not bound to
perform the Contract Prier. in Summa Silvestrin. verb. Sponsalia. q. 10.
versic. nono. post Jo. And. in d. c. de illis. Covar. tract. de Sponsal. 1.
part. c. 5. n. 4. quem velim videas.
.

6. The Fifth Case is, when as the Spousals be contracted in minority; for the
Minor coming to lawful Age may dissent, and so dissolve the Contract c. de
illis el. 1. de despons. impub. extra.
.

7. The Sixth, when as the Party does after the Contract made, commit
Fornication, for the Innocent Party is at liberty, and may dissolve the
Contract cc. quemadmodum de Jurejur. extra. At Maechus resilire non potest, Si
modo Innocens velit secum. contrahere. c. 2. de transac. Praelat. Prier. verb.
Sponsalia q. 10. verse. Septimo.
; and so it is for Spiritual Fornication, that is to say, for Haeresie,
Apostasy, or Infidelity Prier. ubi supra dd. in c. quemadmodum de Jure-Jur.
entra. Melchior Kling. Tract. de causis, Matrimonial. fol. 5. in fin. c. non
solum 28. q. 1.
.

8. The Seventh is, when as the one Party does happen to be infected with some
foul Disease, as Leprosy, or the French Pox, or to be afflicted with some
notable deformity, as the loss of her Nose, or her Eye, etc. for in this Case
the other Party is not to be pressed to marry that Person, so diseased or
deformed d. c. quemadmodum de Jure-Jur. c. ultim. de Conjug. Leprosorum extra.
Quod verum est si post Contractunt eveniat, secus si manifest inierat tempore
initi Contractus. Prier. Silvestr. verb. Sponsal. q. 10. verse. sexto.
.

9. The Eighth is, when some deadly enmity and unquenchable hatred is sprung up
between the Parties affianced; for in this Case also the Spousals may be
dissolved Summa Hostiens. tit. de Spons.. qualiter. dissol. verb. Sin autem
capitalis. Prier. ubi supra, versic. octavo.
.

10. The Ninth is, when as some new affinity does arise betwixt the Parties
betroathed, within the Degrees prohibited c. 2. c. fraternitati etc. ex literis
de eo qui Cogno. Consang. ux. suae extra. Summa Hostiens.. qualiter
dissolvantur versic. Item tertio

does lie with his Brother Silvestr. Prier. verb. Sponsalia q. 10. versic.

canonico etiamst coitus sit illicitus. c. discretionem. juncta glossa in verbo.
nec affinitas. de eo qui cog. sang. ux. and ibi Pan. n. 6. and notat Host. in

c. fraternitatis etc. ex literis de eo qui cog. consang. ux. fuae. Kling tract.
de cause. Matrimonial. fol. 6. Henr. Boic. in c. de illis de Sponsal.
.

11. The Tenth is, when as there is a Fame or common report, That there is some
lawful impediment betwixt the Parties contracted; in which Case for fear of
Scandal they are to be admonished, to abstain from marrying c. cum in tua de
Sponsal. extra.
; And if the impediment be lawfully proved, then are they to be compelled to
abstain Panor. Praepos. and alii in d.c. cum in tua and in c. super eo de
Consang. and affin. extra.
.

12. The Eleventh is, when the one Party is so severe and cruel as the other
dare not proceed in the Match, for in this Case the Spousals may be dissolved
Panor. in c. veniens. qui Clerici. vel voven, extra. Prier. verb. Sponsalia. q.
10. verse. decimo quinto.
.

13. The Twelfth Case is, when as one of the Parties contracted does contract
Spousals de proesenti with another Person: For by the second Spousals de
praesenti, the former de futuro be dissolved c. is qui etc. Si inter de Spons.
extra.
, albeit they were confirmed with an Oath Ibidem.
; and albeit the new espoused Party did before the Solemnization of the
Marriage depart this Life; for the former Spousals once destroyed, receive no
force by the destruction of the second Spousals Praepos. in c. sicut ex
literis. de Sponsal. extra. n. 8.
, unless those Spousals de praesenti were destroyed from the first beginning,
that is to say, unlawful at the first; for unlawful Spousals de praesenti do
not destroy, nor yet hurt the former lawful Spousals de futuro Praepos. in d.
c. sicut. n. 9. facit c. non praestat. de Reg. Jur. 6.
.

14. Finally and generally whenever there is just and reasonable Cause c. ex.
literisel. 2. de Spons. extra. Prier. verb. Sponsalia q. 10. verse. decimo
Septimo.
, (as there be a great many more Causes expressed in the Canon Law Clavas. in
Summa Angelica verb. Sponsalia. and Prier. in Summa Silvestrin. cod. verb. ubi
enumerantur 17 Causae dissolvendi Sponsalia, Quibus add Henr. Boic. in c. de
illis de Sponsal. extra.
, of the lawfulness and reasonableness whereof I make some doubt, which is the
Cause wherefore I have omitted them), Spousals de futuro may be dissolved d. c.
ex literis el. 2. Melchior Kling. tract. de Cause. Matrimonial. fol. 3.
; nor is either Party precisely to be compelled to the performance thereof
against their Will, though otherwise they be punishable for their Contempt, as
is before expressed, amongst the effects of Spousals.

15. There is one thing yet remaining, which may not be omitted, and this it
is; Where I said that Spousals de futuro are sometimes dissolved ipso facto,
and sometimes to be dissolved by the Sentence of the Judge, In what Cases are
they forthwith dissolved, or to be dissolved according to that distinction?
Briefly in all Cases the Authority of the Church is requisite, unless the
Contrary be expressed Jo. And. and al. j in c. de illis de. Sponsal. extra
Prier. verb. Sponsalia in fin. Covar. tract. de Sponsal. 1. part. c. 5. n, 12.
, as in that Case of second Spousals de praesenti Henr. Boic. in d.c. de illis
Melchior Kling tract. de Causis Matrimonial. fol. 6. dd. in c. fi inter de
Spons. extra.
, or of the certain praefixed time expired Boic. and Kling ubi supra per c.
sicut de Spons. extra.
; for there they be dissolved ipso facto: Likewise when the Cause of
dissolution is notorious Silvester Prier. verb. Sponsalia q. 11.
, that is, known to a multitude L. ea quidem. and Bald. ibidem C. de Accus.
; or when the Spousals be Secret, known to none but to themselves, then also
they may be secretly released, without the Authority of the Church Prier. ubi
supra. Summa Angelica verb. Sponsalia in fin.
