To the Honorable JOHN PARKER One of the BARONS Of his Highness the LORD
PROTECTORS COURT OF THE Public Exchequer.
SIR,
IN pursuance of what I not long since intimated in the close of the Epistle
Dedicatory prefixed to my Practical Register, and in hopes of as favorable an
acceptance of this tender of my respectfull service, as you then pleased to
afford my weak endeavors, am I now encouraged to make this my second humble
adress. Though this be but a younger brother, in respect of its time of
production, yet in reference to its first conception, growth, and parts, I may
justly say, it far excels the elder birth, and is much more fit to do your
Honor, and the Public, service, and may be (I conceive) capable of as large,
if not of a greater measure of your favor and protection. I will not be
troublesome to you in relating the pains and time I have taken and spent in
this Collection and Publication, but shall leave it to your judicious
consideration. How great soever they have been I repent me not, but am (in my
self) abundantly satisfied, and do think it reward enough, that I have thereby
gained this opportunity to show my continuing humble respects to your Honor,
and my willingness to be some way serviceable to others, whatever I have been
to my self (in that Vocation God has of his goodness been pleased to place me
in) and to give an Account to the World (a thing which I hold every good
Christian is bound to do) of the expense of my time.

It may be objected, that the Press has been very fertile in this our Age, and
has brought forth many, if not too many births of this nature. I must confess
this Truth; but how legitimate most of them are, let the Learned judge: This I
am sure of, there is not a father alive to own many of them, and they speak so
plain in the Language of Ashdod, Neh. 13. v. 23.
that a knowing man cannot believe they ever sprung from Israelitish Parents,
but by their pronouncing of Siboleth instead of Shiboleth, Jud. 12. v. 5.
may easily collect of what extract they are. What I here present you with, is,
(though a Homely, yet) a lawful Issue, and I dare call it mine own, and that
(I believe) I may do with as good a right as any ever might a work of the like
nature, having had as little (if not less) assistance from others in the
bringing it forth, as any that have traveled in this kind before me. I am not
so blindly fond, or so opiniastre as to think it free from Errors and
Misprisions, I fear there may too many be found in it, and no wonder, for
Humanum est errare, labi, decipi; yet this I do knowingly aver, that I have not
(herein) ex proposito or willingly injured any, but have been as studious and
careful in the penning of this my Collection to do right to every person
concerned, and to make the Truth appear clearly in its native colors, as was
possible at a throngued Bar to do. Nor have I been less wanting in my best
endeavors, to prevent and correct the Errors of the Press, (though I must
acknowledge my pains and care are not herein fully answered) that it might
appear in public, though not in so rich a Dress as to be a Companion for the
best, yet (at least) be by your favor suffered to pass (as tolerable) amidst
the crowd of a multitude of Editions, clothed in as ill if not in a worse and
more unbeseeming habit,

Inner Temple, May the 17th. 1658. Sir, I am yours most obliged, respectively
to serve you WILLIAM STYLE.

To the Industrious, and Ingenuous Professors, and Students of the Common Laws
of England; but more particularly, and affectionately to the Associates of the
honorable Society of the Inner Temple.
GENTLEMEN.
FOr a more noble Epithet I know not how to give you (the greatest and best of
men on earth being in truth no more.) These ensuing Reports were at first
briefly taken by me in the Law-french, without any thought of making other use
of them, then for my one private satisfaction, And they did for some time after
lie so confusedly scattered in my Note-books, that as they then lay, they were
altogether useless to any but my self, and that not without much expense of
time and great trouble, so that what of them my unhappy memory could not
retain, (which was not much) was in a manner lost as well to my self, as unto
others; to remedy this inconvenience, (if I may so call it,) of the loss of my
constant attendance, and pains for so many years together taken at the now
upper Bench Bar, with very little profit either to others or my self, than some
small improvement of my knowledge in the practical part of the law, and in
pursuance of that ancient Moral Axiom, Omne agens agit propter aliquem sinem,
I was encouraged to continue my travail, and expense of time in the gathering
together, transcribing, and putting of them into that order, and method you now
behold them, yet as then not having any intent or desire to make them public,
but only more readily useful to my self, and such of my Friends and
Acquaintance as should at any time desire to be satisfied in any thing I was
able to impart unto them. But this not answering the expectation, and
importunities of some of my near relations, and many of my intimate Friends and
Acquaintance, nor knowing into whose hands my papers might fall, nor how my
self and others be injured in the publishing of them after my decease, which I
was uncertain when it might happen, and did believe it could not be many years
off, by reason of my declining years; but more especially in respect of the
weak and crasy constitution of my Body much macerated by sharp, and tedious
sicknesses, and being willing to leave some testimony behind me, that I have
not slighted, or wholly neglected my calling, but have ever had an honorable
esteem of it, though I have hitherto reaped but little of that benefit, which
too too many do so eagerly hunt after, but have been doing something therein,
and have not lived altogether a drone for so many years together in so famous a
Society amidst so many learned men, to the dishonor thereof, and to my one
reproach; I did at last resolve (notwithstanding the unavoidable censures,
which I was confident I should meet withal, what ever I have, or could say to
avoid them,) to give way to this publication of them, even in this age, wherein
most of the Cases, and matters herein reported are yet fresh (I suppose) in the
memories of many, who may easily trace me where ever I step awry; But I hope to
find them not only just in vindicating of me, in that which I have truly and
faithfully reported, but also favorable in censuring, and passing by those
slips and misprisions they may herein meet withal, caused either by the
Printers negligence, or my own misapprehension of the sense of the matters, and
things delivered and spoken unto, and the rather, in regard that I have
endeavored as near as I could to render things in the same expressions they
were first uttered, that so I might as much as might be, avoid the danger of
injuring of any herein concerned, by putting another sense upon them, than what
they intended; and this as it was the old way, so I conceive what ever may be
objected to the contrary, that it is the best, and cleerest way of reporting.
For those, that make it their business to censure, and not to read or
understand books, I shall say nothing to them, but leave them to abound in
their one sense if they have any, and to please themselves with their own
phansies. I have made these Reports speak English, not that I believe they will
be thereby generally more useful, for I have been always, and yet am of
opinion, that that part of the Common Law which is in English has only
occasioned the making of unquiet spirits contentiously knowing, and more apt to
offend others, than to defend themselves; but I have done it in obedinece to
authority, and to stop the mouths of such of this English age, who though they
be as confusedly different in their Minds and Judgments, as the builders of
Babel were in their languages, yet do think it vain, if not impious to speak or
understand more than their own mother tongue. Some may peradventure,
Notwithstanding the reasons I have formerly offered for this my publication, be
ready to object that it was vain, glory, and a too confident boldness, and
high conceit of mine own abilities that makes me thus appear in public; but
those that know me I believe are of another opinion, and dare clear me of this
aspersion, and well they may, for the truth is I have always been, and yet am
so naturally distrustful of my own parts, that I fall far short of that
necessary boldness which is requisite for every man to be armed withal in the
excercising of public employments, and what loss I have suffered by the want
of this, I my self do best know, and is not unknown to many, some of whom have
out of their well-wishes to me, and others to my disparagement (as they
thought) been pleased to take notice of it. If any of the Cases and matters
herein contained seem common unto any, and are to insipid to please their
curious Palates, let them pass them over: It may be they may prove useful to
others, and I doubt not but the most curious may find many things that may give
them delight and satisfaction. And in the farther vindication of these Reports,
I shall desire all to take notice, that first, these were most of them) taken
in unsettled times, wherein the Law was almost at a stand, and therefore it
cannot be reasonably expected they should be so quick and full of matter, as
those that have been gathered when the Laws flowed in a more open, and
uninterrupted Channel, when the Courts of Justice were full fraught with
business, and were in a more splendent and flourishing condition than in these
latter times; and next, that this work is not a collection only of some choice
Cases taken by several hands in all the Courts of Westminster; but is only a
continued narrative of the Cases, and proceedings of the new upper Bench Court
for 10 years together, and taken by one only hand, without the help or
assistance of any other, during which time I have omitted but little, saving
when by reason of sickness, I was for a Term or two constrained to be absent.
And the more to encourage all to the perusal of them, I dare affirm that there
is much various matter contained in them, and different from what is to be
found in other Reports taken in former years, occasioned by the many alteration
of the face of things, and the changes of government happing at this time, and
also by reason of my constant observing, inserting, and interweaving of all the
remarkable passages transacted on the Criminal side, with those happening on the
Pleas side, which in other Reports has very sparingly at any time, if at all
been performed. I have also for the Readers greater ease and benefit, added
hereunto three Alphabetical Tables, the first containing the names of the
several Cases; a second containing the several general Heads, or Titles under
which the several matters dispersed through the whole book, are properly
digested; and the third, and last, being a large Table particularly directing
to the Page and Case, wherein you may find the subject matter methodically
ranged under those Heads or Titles. And for your further and fuller
satisfaction, and making the Cases the cleerer proof, and more authentical
authority to be cited and given credit unto, you have the number Rolls
pref^ixed to most of those that are remarkable amongst them. I might, and would
if I had thought it necessary have much enlarged these Reports, and made the
volume swell to a far greater bulk: But my aim and endeavors have generally
been to take the chief points only, and substance of the matters arising and
spoken unto, and the rational parts of the arguments and authorities used and
urged, to enforce and prove what was surmised to be Law on either side, and the
grounds and authorities upon which the opinions and resolutions of the Court
are framed and given, and to pass by all the luxuriant flourishes of wit, and
the multiplying of Similary Cases to the Cases in question, as serving more for
the most part to prove the curious phansy, and much reading of the Arguer, than
the proof of the points of the cases in question, or the satisfaction, or
information of the Auditors or Readers Judgment; and I have ever (yet with
submission to better Judgments,) conceived this concise way of taking Reports
to be far more beneficial and delightful, not only to the Reporter, but also
to those that shall read them, then that long and tedious way, wherein the
truth is so overshadowed with multiplicity of words, that it is very difficult
through those Clouds to discover, and behold her perfect beauty so well, as
when she appears barefaced in her true and natural complexion. I need not say
any thing in commendation of the Common Laws, they do so sufficiently, and
clearly speak their own worth, not only in our own land, but even through the
Christian, if I may not say the whole known world. The fruit that every one
from him that sits on the Throne, to her that grindeth at the Mill, throughout
this nation in the tender preservation of our Religion, Lives, Liberties, and
Properties do lowdly proclaim their excellency, and do justly claim our
reverent esteem of them, and their sweet influence which our Neighbor Nations
do partake of from their light and heat, has purchased an honorable name, and
repute amongst them. Though no doubt but other Kingdoms, and Republiques have
many excellent written and established Laws suitable to the particular
constitutions of the people, and to their several frames of government, and
amongst the rest the Civil or imperial Laws, yet they all want many remarkable
excellencies that are in the Common Laws of England, and the proceedings
therein, and amongst the rest to instance in no more, they are very deficient
in this way used in our Law for many ages past, of reporting, and leaving to
posterity the learned arguments of council at the Bar, and of the grave and
profound resolutions of the reverend Judges in the decision of Cases arising,
and controverted amongst us; and this way how sightly soever it be now esteemed
of by many amongst us, yet is by Strangers much valued, and was heretofore so
much set by amongst us, and thought so highly advantageous to the public,
that the wisdom of this State did then think fit to appoint grave and
judicious men, encouraged by an annual stipend, to attend and perform this
task, and therefore I hope that he who has undertaken this hard labor freely
and voluntarily in relation to the public good, without hope of reward, is so
far from deserving blame and reproof, that he is rather to be cherished and
countenanced in these his endeavors by those in authority, and not to be
rashly and uncharitably calumnicated, or censured by any, but to be favorably
interpreted, and received as one that makes it his aim to be accounted a true
lover of the Common Laws, and really honors the profession, and Professors
thereof.

HILARY TERM
21 Car. Banc. Reg.
A Prohibition was prayed to the Admiralty, Prohibition.
to stop proceedings there, upon a Contract between the parties suggested to be
made upon the land within the body of a County, and not upon the high Sea; And
the surmise was penned thus. If there was any Contract made between the parties
(as the libel supposes) it was made upon the land within the body of a County,
and not upon the high Sea. The Court held this suggestion ill, Suggestion.
for the uncertainty of it, and ordered that it should be amended and made
absolute, viz. That the Contract was made upon the land, etc. And that the
words, if there was any Contract made, should be put out, because they made it
uncertain whether there was any Contract or no, and so by consequence did
destroy the very ground of the surmise.

Barnaby against Goodale,
21 Car. Banc. reg.
Trin. 21 Car. rot. 201.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a judgment given in an Action upon the
Case in the Court at Owse bridge in York, Error upon a Judgment in an action
upon the Caie.
and the first Error assigned was in the Process, because it was by summons;
whereas the action being an action upon the Case, which is in the nature of a
Trespass; the Process should be by Attachment, and Distress infinite, and not
by summons. But to this it was answered by Roll Justice, that since 10 Iacobi
this manner of proceeding is no Error, Error. Capias.
and that that Court has no power to award a Capias in an action upon the case
by the Statute of 1^ H. 7. two other light exceptions were taken to the venire,
but not insisted upon. But the main exception was to Judgment, which was
entered thus, Ideo consideratum est per curiam dicti Domini Regis, whereas (as
it was objected) it ought to have been, ideo consideratum est per candem
Curiam, or per Curiam praedictam. And at the first the Court seemed to incline,
Inferior Courts.
that this was a material exception, for these reasons, viz. because inferior
Courts ought not to show things only by implication; but they ought to show
them expressly, and because surplusages in such Courts are ill: And lastly
because inferior Courts ought to keep themselves strictly to their ancient
forms, and not to vary from them; yet afterward judgment was a firmed except
better matter should be shown, nota.

Masterman.
21 Car. Banc. Reg.
AN action of Debt was brought in an inferior Court, Error upon a judgment in
an action of Deb^ upon an Obligation.
upon an Obligation, with a Condition, for the payment of a certain sum of
money at a certain time therein expressed; but no place was limited in the
condition for the payment thereof. Judgment was given for the Plaintiff: The
Defendant brings a writ of Error in this Court to reverse this Judgment, and
assigns for Error; That because there appears no place of payment for the money
in the Condition of the Bond; so that by that it cannot appear whether the
cause of action lies within the jurisdiction of the Court, where the action
was brought or not; therefore it should have been made appear by some part of
the Record, that the money was to be paid within the Jurisdiction of the Court,
Error.
which is not here done, and therefore the Judgment erroneous: The Court held
this for error, and ordered that the Judgment should be reversed, if cause
were not shown to the contrary before the end of the term.

Knights Case.
21 Car. Banc. Reg.
A Lease for years was made of certain houses in York, Error upon a Judgment
given in an action of Debt for reat.
reserving a yearly rent payable in London, and for the rent behind an action
of Debt was brought in the City of York, and judgment thereupon given for the
Plaintiff: The Defendant brings a writ of Error to reverse this judgment, and
assigns two Errors. 1. That the issue upon which the judgment was given was
not tryable within the jurisdiction of the Court, where the judgment was
given; for the issue was upon the payment of rent, which was payable at London,
and not at York, and so payment or not payment ought to be tried at London and
not at York. The second exception was to the Venire, Veane.
which was de vicineto Civitatis generally, and names not any Parish in
particular whence the jury should come: And to prove this to be a good
exception, the Book of ^ H. 5. was urged; but the Court denied that Book to be
Law, and cited Gavel and Gippoes case, 10 Jac. adjudged to the contrary; that
de vicineto Civitatis generally, without naming a Parish in the City, is good:
But upon the first exception the Court advised.

Watson against Norbury
21 Car. Banc. reg.
Mich. 20 Car. rot. 156.
Watson brought an Action upon the case against Norbury, Action upon the case.
for procuring a Commission of Bankrupt against him, by virtue whereof he broke
open his Shop, and took away his goods and Shopbooks, whereby he was so
discreited that he lost his trade, to his damage, etc. To this the Defendant
pleads, that the Plaintiff did heretofore bring his Action of trespass for the
breaking open of his Shop, and for the taking away of his goods, and had in
that Action recovered damages against him, and demands if he shall not be
thereby barred in this Action; And that he should be barred the Defendants
Council alleged, that a recovery in one personal Action is a bar in all
personal Actions touching the same thing, and that here the Action of trespass
formerly brought, and the Action of the case now brought were personal Actions,
and that they were both brought for the same thing, and therefore the Plaintiff
ought to be barred; It was also urged that an Action of the case lies not in
this case, for that, to ground an Action upon the case, there must appear to be
malice in the party that did the fact, and prejudice to the party to whom the
fact is done, but there appears no malice here, for what was done is said to be
done, by virtue of a Commission of Bankrupt which shall be intended a lawful
authority to warrant the fact, and not grounded upon malice, so that malice and
prejudice do not both appear, but only damage, and that alone will not support
this Action, for neither for damage alone without malice, nor for malice
without damage will an Action upon the case lie. But to this it was answered
(to which the Court enelined) That this Action upon the case was not brought
for the same cause that the Action of trespass was formerly brought, for that
was only for the breaking open of the Shop, and taking away his goods, and the
damages he received thereby, but this Action is brought for the damage he
sustained, by the loss of his credit, and hindrance in his trade thereby,
caused by the Defendants taking out a Commission of Bankrupt against him, and
by color thereof breaking open his Shop and taking away his goods, and so
disparaging him in his reputation, whereby he lost his trade; and though the
breaking open of his Shop, and the taking away his goods be named in this
Action, as it was in the former Action of trespass, Inducement.
yet it is but by way of Inducement to this Action upon his case, and not to
recover damages for that wrong, Actions several.
and here being two several wrongs done to the Plaintiff which do not one
depend upon another, the Plaintiff must bring two several Actions for them,
and not join them in one Action, because the damages must be several which are
to be recovered, Joint Actions.
but if they had depended one upon another he might have joined them in one
Action, and recovered joint damages for both: Joint damages.
and besides these two Actions differ in their nature one from the other, and
the judgments given in them are several, for the Judgment in an Action of
Trespass vi et Armis, as the first Action was, is Capiatur, because there is
thereupon a fine due to the King, but the Judgment in an Action upon the case
is ideo in misericordia, and so though the Plaintiff have Judgment here in his
Action upon the case, it cannot be said he has had Judgment already; for that
must beintended, at least a Judgment of the same nature, which cannot be in
this case. And to that which is objected, that if the Plaintiff should recover
damages in this Action, he should recover damages twice for one and the same
thing which is against Law; it is answered, that it is not for the same thing
but clearly for another, and if he should not have this Action he were without
remedy for the damage he suffered in the loss of his Credit, and the damage in
his Trade; for in the former Action he recovered no damages for that, for the
Jury never took that into their consideration, for they had no power to take
any damages into their consideration which happened after the Trespass done,
for which the Action was brought, but only for the breaking open of the Shop,
and the taking away of his Goods; and although he might at the first have
brought his Action upon the case as he has now done, yet he was not
commpellable thereto, but had his Election to bring either an Action upon his
case, or an Action of Trespass as should most make for his advantage, Election
of Actions
for this Election of Action belongs to every subject as his birth right, and
he is not to be hindered from it. Adjournatur.

Remington and Kingerby.
Mich. 18 Car. rot. 72.
REmington grants a rent out of certain Lands to Fawn with a clause of
distress, Error upon a Judgment in an Annuity in the Common plea^
and a nomine poenae in the deed for the non payment thereof, according to the
time lymited, the rent is behind after the time lymited by the nomine poenae.
Fawn brings a writ of Annuity in the Common Pleas for the Arrerages of the
Annuity, and for the moneys due upon the nomine poenae, and has Judgment.
Remington brings his writ of Error in this Court to reverse this Judgment, and
Assigns for Error, that the writ of Annuity did not lie for the nomine poenae,
though it did for the rent, for though it was in the Power, and Election of
Fawn to charge either the land out of which the rent was to issue with the
rent behind by distress, and so to make it a rent charge, or else to bring his
writ of Annuity for it against Remington, and so to charge his person; yet he
had no such Power for the nomine poenae, because it was in the nature of a
rent, and was necessarily to issue out of the Land, Nomi^e yoe. 1 ae.
and not to be charged upon the Person; and it was further alleged that a
nomine poenae was an uncertain thing and comes not within the Statute of 21 H.
8. touching Avowries as a rent charge does which is certain. Another exception
was, that it appears notin the Record, that Fawn did make a good demand of
this nomine poenae upon the Land out of which the rent was issuing, as he ought
to have done before he could bring an Action for it, for though there do appear
to be a demand, yet if it appear not to be a legal demand it is Null, and the
party shall take no benefit by it. Adjourned.

Nuls and Cheney
21 Car. B. R.
AN Action of the case was brought for these words, Arrest of Judgment in in
Action upon the case.
I do accuse you to be a Witch, and require you to be searched, and a verdict
was given for the Plaintiff; the Defendant moves in Arrest of Judgment that
the words are not actionable, because it is not averred that the party accused
had done any hurt to Cattle or otherwise, or has had any Communication wit
the Devil. And so the Court held, because the words spoken did not bring the
Party of whom they were spoken within the Statute of 10 Jac, concerning
Witchcraft.

Wingfield and Sherwood.
VVIngfield brings an Action of Covenant against Sherwood his Lessee for years,
Error upon a Judgment in an Action of Covenant.
and declares that he had Covenanted by indenture that he would not cut down
more timber growing upon the lands demised than sufficient for needful and
necessary reparations of the houses and buildings let unto him; and for breach
Assigns, that he had cut down timber to the value of ten pounds, and had
converted them to his proper use; and upon this has a Verdict and a Judgment
against him: Sherwood brings a writ of Error in this Court to reverse this
Judgment, and Assigns for Error, that there was variance between the Covenant
expressed in the lease, and the Covenant set forth in the declaration whereupon
the breach was assigned, and so the Judgment was not given upon a breach of
the Covenant expressed in the lease, viz. That he should not cut down more
timber than was necessary for reparations; for by this breach the Plaintiff
supposes that the Defendant had Covenanted not to cut down timber to employ to
his own use, which is not the Covenant expressed in the lease, but another: And
though the Defendant had cut down timber, and converted it to his own use,
Covenant.
this was not a breach of the Covenant expressed in the Indenture, except it be
averred that he cut down more than was necessary for reparations, and converted
it to his own use; and for this Error the Judgment was reversed.

Whitwell and Short.
Trin. 21. Carl. rot. 227.
WHitwell brought an Action of Trespass for assaulting, beating, Arrest of

and wounding him, against fowr several persons: three of them plead not
guilty, and are found guilty; and the fourth pleads not guilty to part, and
iustifies for the rest, viz. The wounding, and is found guilty as to the
wounding only, yet the verdict was fond generally for the Plaintiff, and entire
damages assessed and Judgment given, and a writ of Error was brought, and the
Error assigned was that the damages ought not to be entire against all, because
that the fourth person was only found guilty of part of the trespass, to wit,
the wounding, and therefore as to him the damages ought to have been severed,
in relation only to the wounding, and not as it is, for so damages should be
given twice for the same thing. Several damages.
First against the three, and then against the fourth, which the Court granted,
and reversed the Judgment.

Ward and Coggin.
Pasc. 22 Car. rot. 257.
Ward brings an Action of debt in the Common pleas against Coggin, Error upon
an action of Debt.
and declares that the Defendant in consideration that he the Plaintiff, at the
request of the Defendant, had sold certain wares to I. S. did assume and
promise to him the Plantiff, that he would pay such a sum of money for them;
and for non payment accordingly he brings his Action, and has a Verdict and
Judgment. The Defendant brings his writ of Error in this Court to reverse this
Judgment, and Assigns for Error, That an Action of debt lies not in this case,
because the debt which the Defendant promised to pay, and for which the Action
is brought, was raised, and became a duty before the promise made for the
payment of it, and so an Action of debt cannot be grounded for it on the
promise. And the words in the declaration do sound merely upon a promise, upon
which a good consideration for an Action of the case may be grounded; Case.
but not to bring an Action of debt.

Hogg and Vaughan.
HOgg brings an Action of the Case against Vaughan for these words spoken of
him, Arrest of Judgment in an action upon the Case.
viz. Thou art a perjured Priest, and has a verdict. It was moved in Arrest of
Judgment, that the words were not actionable, for they signified no more than
that he was forsworn; But the Court held that they must be meant, that he was
guilty of perjury, for which he might be endicted, and therefore were
actionable.

Mich. 21 Car.
I. Assumes and promises to B. that if B. will pay 50 l. to C. his son, Action
upon the case upon a promise.
who was married to D. the Daughter of I. at such a time, that he will pay 100
l. to D. his Daughter at such a time; B. pays the 50 l. to C. at the time
appointed, I. fails in payment of the 100 l. according as was agreed; B. dies
intestate, and E. administers, and brings an Action upon the Case against I.
upon this promise made to B. the Testator; and adjudged that the Action did
well lie by the Administrator, though he should receive no benefit if he did
recover.

Dickenson and Preston.
Mich. 22 Car. Banc. reg.
Ter. Pasc. 22 Car. rot. 251.
A Writ of Error was brought by Preston, Error to reverse a Judgment in York.
to reverse a Judgment against him at York, and assigns for Error, that the
Venire was de Balliva sua, whereas it ought to have been de corpore Comitatus,
and it cannot appear by the Venire to what place the Balywick extends; and the
Balywick of the City may extend further than the City, and upon this the Court
adjudged the Venire naught.

More against Savage.
22 Car. Banc. reg.
MOre Widow brings an appeal against Savage for the death of her Husband;
Savage appears and demurs to the original writ, Demurrer upon an appeal
and shows for cause, that in one part of the writ, instead of the word tun^ it
was tuc, which made the Writ uncertain To this the Council of the other part
answered, That it ought to be amended by the Statute of 14 E. 3. and that the
Writ ought not for so small a fault to be abated; But to this it was replied,
that the Statute was only for the amendment of mean process, and not of
original Writs; for original writs were not amendable, because the party might
purchase a new writ if a former were naught. In justification of the writ it
was further urged, that the word tunc in the writ was a mere formal word, and
not of the substance of the writ: and that the writ would be good enough
without it; and therefore though it were mistaken, it was not so material, as
that the writ should be thereby abated: But the Court answered, that an
original writ, if it be defective in form, is abatable, if it be not amendable
by Statute, and conceived, that here it being in an appeal, where life is in
question, the writ is not amendable, though it be defective but in form,
neither by the Common Law nor by any Statute Law, nor can the party purchase a
new writ, adjournatur; but afterward, viz. 9. Feb. 22 Car. the writ was
quashed for the cause aforesaid, and because it did not appear that the feme
who brought the appeal was wife to the party slain at the time when he was
slain. It was thereupon moved that the Defendant might be arraigned upon the
Count, though the writ was abated; but the Court held he could not, because the
Count was founded on the writ which was abated, and these books were cited, 4
H. 6.14. and 18 E. 3.35. upon view of presidents he was afterward discharged.

Luskins and Carver.
22 Car. Banc. reg.
THe Case was this, Anne Carver made her last will and testament, Prohibition
to the Prae^ogative Court, and a Mandamus.
and makes Luskins her Executor, having bona notabilia in diverse Diocesses:
Luskins proves the will in an inferior Diocese, and not in the Prerogative
Court, as he ought to have done, a stranger sues for Letters of Administration
in the Prerogative Court, Luskins desires to prove the will there, and that he
may administer, the Court refuses to admit him to administer the goods, except
he will put in security to the Court to pay all the Legacies; but if he shall
refuse, will grant Letters of administration to the stranger. Mandamus
Luskins moves in this Court for a writ of a Mandamus, to compel the
Prerogative Court to grant him the administration, according to the will. The
Court ruled the other party to show cause the next day why they should not
grant such a writ; and were of clear opinion they might do it, and to prove it,
the Countess of Barkshires case, Hill. 20 Iac. and the case of St. Burien in
Cornwall was cited, and the same Term the writ was granted accordingly.

Fortescue and Brograve.
22 Car. Banc. Reg.
The Plaintiff brings an action for breach of Covenant upon a Deed, An action
upon a breach of Covenant by deed.
The Defendant pleads a parol agreement afterward, in discharge of the former
Covenant; but the Court held the plea not good, and took these differences, Plea
That a parol agreement before a breach of it, may be discharged by parol, and
so pleaded; after a breach it cannot be pleaded in discharge without
satisfaction also pleaded; Concord.
but a discharge may be pleaded by Deed be the Covenant by Parol or by Deed
after a breach, and without satisfaction.

Broom and Evering,
Hill. 22 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hill. 21 Car. rot. 354.
A Judgment was given against the Testator of the Defendant, Error to reverse
a judgment given in a Scire facias to revive a judgment in debt.
in an action of Debt for rent, and this judgment was revived by a scire
facias against the Executor, and a verdict thereupon, and a judgment was given
against him in the Common pleas; upon this a writ of Error was brought in the
Kings Bench to reverse this judgment, and the error assigned was, that the
trial was insufficient, because the Venire sacias was not good, and is not
helped by the Statute of Ieofails, and to prove this, Baynams case in the 5th.
Report was cited. But Hales answered, that the Venire facias being awarded
before it ought, was to be accounted as if no Venire had been awarded, and said
it was like to a dedimus to take a fine before the writ of Covenant issued
forth to levy the fine, and so concluded, that it was helped by the Statute of
Jeofails. But the Court took a difference,
where in truth there was no Venire facias at all, and where there is an ill
Venire facis as it is here, for thought it be as bad as may be, yet being it is
a Venire facias, it is not helped by the Statute of Ieofails; Er^or J^o^ ils
but if there had been none, the Statute had made the trial good without it;
and thereupon day was given to show cause why the Judgment should not be
a^firmed. Pasch. 23 Car. the Judgment was affirmed.

Andrews Case.
Hill. 22 Car. Banc. Reg.
A Recognizance was acknowledged at Sergeants June in Fleetstreet, Where a
Scire facias upon a recognisance shall be brought.
and delivered and enrolled at Westminster. The Court held that it was at the
election of the Recognisee to bring his Scire facias either in London, where
the Recognizance was acknowledged, or in Midlesex, where it was delivered and
enrolled: But adjourned. Afterward, viz. Pasc. 23 Car. the Court held that the
Scire facias ought to be where the recognizance is taken, and not where it is
recorded; for there it begins to be a Record; but this being in the Common
Pleas, it was good both ways, and thereupon the party had his judgment.

Rooke and Knight.
22 Car. Mich.
Mich. 22 Car. rot. 381.
A Judgment given in the Court at Dym Church, Demurrer to a Scire facias upon
a judgment removed out of the Cinqne Ports by Certiorari in the Kings Bench.
a limb of one of the Cinque Ports was removed by a certiorari into the Kings
Bench; and thereupon issued a Scire facias for the Defendant, to show cause why
the Plaintiff should not have execution upon the judgment; to this the
Defendant appears and demurs, and takes these exceptions, 1. That it is not
expressed where Dim Church is. 2ly. In the retorn of the alias certiorari, it
is said, sicut prius, and not sicut alias. 3ly, the Sheriff in the reforn is
not namned Knight and Baronet; neither does he name himself by his name of
Baptism and Surname; But the Court did overruled all these exceptions, and gave
judgment for the Plaintiff.

AN action of the Case was brought for these words, Action upon the Case for
words.
Thou have stoll'n my wood, and the Court inclined the words were actionable,
but not if he had said, thou have stoll'n my Trees, and it was said that a
precipe will lie of a wood; for it shall be intended of woody ground;
adjourned. Pracipe


Helliar and Grace his Wife.
Pasch. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
AN action upon the Case was brought by Helliar and his wife, Action upon the
Case upon an Assumpsit.
upon a promise made unto them, during the Coverture; and it was moved, (a
verdict being given for the Plaintifs) in arrest of judgment, that the Action
ought to have been brought in the name of the Husband only, and not by the
husband and wife; and a case to prove it was cited out of Dyer, Dyer 91.
and upon this exception the judgment was arrested till the other should show
cause to the contrary; And in this case it was said by the Court, that if an
Obligation be made to baron and feme; that it is the better opinion, Joint
action
that the baron may bring an action upon this obligation in his own name only,
and not name his wife, or else he may at his election bring the action in the
name of himself and his wife jointly.

Betsworth and Betsworth.
Pasch. 8 Maii 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
It was moved for a Prohibition to the Prerogative Court upon a surmise that
the party did endeavor to barstardise one that was legitimate. But the other
party answered, that the surmise was not true, and urged, that the suit in the
Praerogative Court was only, Pr^hibition to the Praerogative Court.
whether Letters of administration were by them well granted, or no, and not
concerning Bastardy as the surmise sets forth, and therefore desires the
Prohibition may not be granted; and for confirmation thereof the case was put,
which was this: Betsworth had a wife called Bridget, who died; after he takes
another wife called also Bridget, and dies intestate; Bridget the second wife
takes Letters of administration of the goods and chatels of her husband
deceased; the son of Betsworth sues in the Praerogative Court to repeal these
Letters of Administration, upon pretense that Bridget the first wife of
Betsworth was yet living. In this case the Court delivered these positions
following. Jurisdiction,
1. That one ought not to sue in the Ecclesiastical Court, to Bastard an issue,
Ordinary
but at the Common Law. 2. Where the Ordinary has granted Letters of
Administration to one that ought to have them, they ought not to be repealed by
them. 3. Where a suit is in the Ecclesiastical Court for lands and goods,
Prohibition
a Prohibition may be granted as to the lands; and they may proceed there
notwithstanding, as to the goods. 4. That in this Case at the Bar, neither
Bastardy of the issue, nor marriage is in question, as is surmised, but only the
validity of the Letters of Administration, Incidents
and that the other things are but as incident to the matter in question. 5.
That wife or not wife is triable at the Common Law; but whether lawfully married
or not, Trial
is tryable in the Spiritual Court. 6. Where a thing is tryable in the
Spiritual Court, and there is also a matter incident to it, which is tryable at
the Common Law, there a Prohibition shall not be granted. Prohibition Evidence
7. That a thing concluded in the Ecclesiastical Court touching lands, cannot
be given in evidence in a trial at Law for Land. 8. If the Common law differ
from the Civil Law, touching the legality or non legality of a thing, if they
will proceed according to their Law, a Prohibition lies, because the Common Law
is to be preferred. The rule of Court was, Prohibition
That a Prohibition should be granted, and that the other should demur upon it;
and so it might be debated whether a Prohibition would lie or not, and to stay
in the Spiritual Court in the mean time.

Pasch.
23 Car. Banc. Reg.
ONe brought an Action upon the Case against I. S. for preferring a bill of
Endictment against him, Arrest of judgment in an action upon the case.
for stealing of a Mare, and that the grand Jury found an ignoramus, whereby he
was discharged; the Plaintiff obtains a Verdict against the Defendant. The
Defendant takes these exceptions to the declaration in Arrest of Judgment, 1.
That it does not appear thereby, that the Party who preferred the bill of
Endictment gave any evidence to the grand Jury touching the bill. 2ly. It
appears not that the Plaintiff was bound over to answer the Felony, and
consequently was not molested ^y it, and so he can have no Action: But the
Court stayed the Judgment to another day upon the exceptions taken, Case.
and said that an Action upon the Case lies for procuring one to be Endicted,
Endictment.
although the party himself do it not, and that one may exhibit a bill of
Endictment to a grand Jury without Oath, grand Jury
and they may notwithstanding find the bill, and although it be exhibited upon
Oath, they are not bound to find it, if they see cause to the contrary, and
that in the case at the bar the Action might be as well grounded upon the
scandal, which grew to the party who was Endicted, as upon the trouble which
might have befallen him by reason of the preferring the bill against him.

Hellena,
Pasc. 23 Car. B. r.
AN Action upon the Case was brought for these words, Arrest of Judgment in an
Action upon the Case.
Hellena is a great Witch, and a Verdict found for the Plaintiff; It was moved
to stay Judgment, because the words were not Actionable, for they did not show
that the Plaintiff had bewitched any thing, or done any thing that brought her
within the compass of the Statute 1. Jac. against Witchcraft: Judgment was
hereupon stayed.

Williamson against Henley.
Pasc. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. 21 Car. rot. 362.
AN Action of Debt was brought upon an obligation, Arrest of Judgment in Debt
upon an obligation.
the condition was, that if the Defendant did sell the tithes in Ransom more
that he should pay the Plaintiff such a sum of money, but if he sold them not,
that then he should deliver an obligation to the Plaintiff, for the payment of
a certain sum of money therein expressed at a certain day therein limited, and
for non performance of the condition is the Acion brought. The Plaintiff
obtains a Verdict; the Defendant moves in Arrest of Judgment, Time.
that he ought to have convenient time for doing of the things expressed in the
condition, and that it appears not by the Record that he had convenient time,
and so there is no breach of the condition. But the Court held, that the time
between the date of the obligation, and the bringing of the Action was a
conveninent time, and that there being a second thing to be performed in case
the former were not done, that therefore that former thing ought to be done in
some reasonable time, elce the party would be too much prejudiced by staying to
have the second thing performed, and therefore ruled that Judgment should be
entered without better matter should be showed.

Savages Case, Pasc. 23 Car. B. R.
SAvage was Endicted for forging, and publishing of Letters of credence to
gather money, Error upon a Judgment upon an Endictment.
and was convicted, and Judgment given against him upon his own confession,
and 100 l. fine set upon him, et quod capiatur. Exceptions were taken to this
Judgment. 1. That it did not appear where he received any money by virtue of
these counterfeit Letters, nor at what time: But the Court answered, that the
substance of the offense for which he was Endicted was, Endictment.
the forging and publishing of the Letters, and not the collecting of the
money; for though he had not collected a penny, yet the Endictment was good. A
second exception was, that the Endictment did not say quod Counterfecit falso:
But the Court held that the word Counterfecit necessarily employed in it the
word falso, and so not material whether falso were expressed or omitted. 3ly.
It was objected, that the party was committed before he was convicted; But to
this the Court answered, Conviction.
that he was committed upon his own confession, which is a conviction in Law,
and the Judgment held good, and affirmed.

Needler and Guest.
Pasc. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Entered Trin, 1649. rot.
NEedler brings an Action of Covenant against Guest, Artest of Judgment in a
breach of Covenant.
upon Articles, amongst which one was to allow such a sum of money to an under
Clerk, in the six Clerks Office by the sheet, for every quire of paper he
should writein copying and engrossing of bills, answers, etc. as was expressed
in the said Articles: and upon this Needler obtains a verdict against Guest. In
Arrest of Judgment diverse exceptions were taken and overruled, but one was
insisted upon, which was this, that there was more found in the breach of the
Covenant assigned then was contained in the Covenant it self, for it was found,
that he had not paid for 72 sheets which was 5 quire and a half, and so
damages were given for more than ought to be, Breach.
for the Covenant was to pay so much the quire and mentions not any half,
Damages.
and for this the Judgment was stayed: for the Court said that the Law would
not supply a casus omissus to bring it within the Covenant to ground a breach
thereupon, Supply.
what ever the intent of the parties was that were parties to the Articles.

VVhitley and Fawsett.
Pasc. 23 Car. Banc. reg.
VVHitley brings an Action of Trover, Action of Proven for distraining and
selling his Cattle.
and Conversion against Fawsett, for taking his Cattle by way of distress, and
selling them by virtue of a warrant of Commissioners of Sewers for not paying
of a tax set by them toward the reparation of Sea walls: the Defendant pleads
all the special matter, by way of justification, the Plaintiff demurrs to this
Plea, and upon the demurrer takes these exceptions to it. 1. To the setting
forth of the Commission, in that he shows not that three of the Commissioners
were of the quorum. The 2d exception was, that in his Plea he had not s^t forth
the Authority of the Commissioners; To that the Court answered it was not
necessary. 3ly. That the Plea was but argumentative, which makes it naught.
4ly. It appears that there are 800. Acres of Land which are in the hands of the
King, Tax.
which are not taxed as by law they ought: and so the tax is unjust, because by
the not taxing of them, a greater burden was laid upon the rest of the Land,
than of right ought to be; and this the Court held a good exception, and said
that the Kings Lands are taxable by the Statute. 5ly. The Statute is not
pleaded as it ought to be. 6ly It does not express, that Whitley in whose
occupation the Lands are that are taxed, is the Assignee to Lynsee the owner of
the Lands, but he may be a mere stranger, and so not taxable, nor his beasts to
be sold. 7ly. It is not set forth, that he showed his warrant, before he
distrained, as he ought to do: Distress.
In this case the Court first said that one may distrain, and sell the Cattle
of the owner of the Land taxed, or his Assignee, for non payment thereof, Sale.
but doubted whether a strangers Cattle might be distrained and sold: Roll
Justice took these Exceptions to the Plea. 1. Plea.
That the Plea did not set forth the limits of the Commission as it ought to
do, and was therefore ill. 2ly. He said the Plea ought to have showed, that
three of the Commissioners were of the quorum. 3ly. That it did not appear by
the Plea that the Lands taxed, where the distress was made, are within the
Level, to be taxed by the Commissioners. 4ly. The Tax is of the Land of such an
one, and his Assigns, and this is too generally expressed, and cannot be
levied equally by such a tax. 5ly. The Plea sets not forth, that there was any
notice given to Whitley of the tax made before the distress taken, as there
ought to have been, and for these reasons, he concluded that the Plea was not
good. Bacon Justice held. first, Waiver.
that the Party had waived his benefit of the Plea given him by the Statute, by
pleading specially, and he ought to make good his plea, as he has pleaded it
at his own peril: He held likewise, that there ought to be notice given of the
tax, and a demand of it, before any distress might be taken, and that the Plea
was defective in this. 3ly. Notice.
That he cannot sell a strangers goods for the tax as Whitley is, for ought
that appears in the Plea. 4ly. Demand.
By the Plea it appears, that he has distrayned one Acre of Land for all the
tax, which ought not to be, and upon these exceptions the rule was for the
Defendant to show cause before the end of the Term, why the Plaintiff should
not have Judgment.

Sr Maurice Abbot.
Pasc. 23 Car. Banc. reg.
SIr Maurice Abbot had a Judgment against one and dies, Motion to Vacate a
Judgment.
and three years after Execution is taken out in his name, upon the Judgment
the Court was moved to vacate this Judgment. but would not, for they said that
there was no help in this case, but by bringing a writ of Error, Error.
except there can be any fraud proved in the proceeddings, and then the Court
will take order to help the Party grieved: Fraud.
And thereupon ruled to examine the Attorney, and the Parties whether there was
due proceedings or no.

Vill de Charleton in Kent.
Pasc. 23 Car. Banc. reg.
A Man was killed at Charleton in Kent, Motion to quash a presentment and take
off Amercements.
upon which the Coroner takes an inquest, and returns it into the Crown Office:
upon this a presentment was drawn up in the Crown Office against the Vill. of
Charleton, and found, and thereupon issues went out against the Vill: It was
moved for the Vill to have them discharged, by reason that the presentment was
not good, for it was grounded upon the Statute of 3 H. 7. chap. and sets forth
that such a person was killed at Charleton, and that the murderer fled away in
the night, by which it appears that the Vill. is not liable to be amerced
within the Statute: for the murderer ought to escape in the day by the
Statute, Amercements
and not in the night, and for this it was quashed, and the Amercements
discharged.

23 Car. Banc. reg.
THe Court was moved to quash an order of sessions, For quashing an order of
the Sessions of Peace, for keeping a Basta^d.
made for the keeping of a Bastard Child, and these exceptions were taken to
the order: First the order was, that the Party should pay a weekly sum for the
keeping of the Child, whereas no such order could be made without the Parties
consent, for by the Statute he is only compellable to secure the Parish, where
the Child was born, that it should not be any charge to the Parish. Another
exception was, that it appears not that the Justices had any power, to make any
order at all in the case, for it appears not where the Child was born, and so
it may be it was born in an other County, where these Justices have no
authority to Act any thing concerning it. Upon these exceptions it was quashed.

THe Court was moved for a certiorari to the Court of Sandwitch, For a
certicratio to remove Endictments out of one of the Ci^que-ports.
to remove four Endictments there for shooting in a Gun, and pulling up of a
post, because the facts, for which the Party was Endicted, were not done within
the Jurisdiction of the Court; But because Sandwitch was one of the
Cinque Ports, and it had been a question heretofore whether this Court could
send such a writ thither, The rule was only for cause to be shown why a
certiorari should not be granted.

Tory.
Pasc. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
TOry brings an Action of Trespass, and false imprisonment against I. S. simul
cum aliis. etc. The Defendant pleads not guilty, Arrest of Judgment in an
Action of Trespass.
and a Verdict is given against him for the Plaintiff; It was moved in Arrest
of Judgment, that the declaration was not good, because it declares against I.
S. by name solely, and it ought to have been jointly against him with the
others, naming them also, because the trespass was joint, and not against I. S.
alone; but the Court held that the declaration was good, because it was with a
simul cum, although the Persons were not named, Declaration.
and said that this was the constant course of the Common Pleas: And that an
ejectione firmae against one simul cum had been ruled to be good, Ejectio ne
^^mae.
and so used in the Common Pleas, although heretofore it has been adjudged to
the contrary: yet the Judgment was stayed till the other should move.

Hill. 22 Car. rot. 1857.
Jones brings an Action of Assault and Battery against Young, Young justifies
as servant to I. S. because, Error to reverse a Judgment against the Plaintiff
in Trespass.
that Jones came to fish in the several Piscary of his Master. Judgment was
given for the Defendant: A writ of Error was brought, and two exceptions taken.
1. That whereas Young, had in his Pl^a of Justification entitled his Master to
the several Piscary by the Kings Letters Patents, he had not shown that the
King was seized of this several Piscary jure Coronae, and so it might be the
King had no power to grant it. 2ly, He does not show his Letters Patents, which
he ought to do, because he derives a title by them; Title.
The rule was to show cause Saturday next why the Judgment should not be
reversed.

The Earl of Lecester against Mrs. Samford.
Pasc. 23. Banc. Reg.
IN a Trover and Conversion, brought by the Earl of Lecester against Mrs.
Samford for certain Jewels, the Trover being laid to be in Kent, but the
Offering the goods to sell, being the Conversion of them being in London; It was
doubted where the trial should be, and the Court said, that generally a
transitory Action is to be laid where the fact was done, Venire.
yet the Party is not tied to lay it there, but may lay it in another County,
and in this case it was held by the Court, that the Plaintiff may bring his
Action where the Jewels were sold, and that was in London, as well as in Kent,
where the Trover was laid, Trover.
for part of the ground of the Action to wit the Conversion was in London,
though part of it, namely the Trover, was laid to be in Kent.

Basely and Baseley.
Pasc. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in Norwitch, and the
Error Assigned was, Error to reverse a Judgment in Norwitch.
that there did but five of the Jury empanelled appear at the trial, and yet a
Verdict was given, and Judgment thereupon. The Court said that a Corporation
cannot grant a tales, neither if they could, does it here appear that there was
a tales granted, and therefore reversed the Judgment.

Sir William Bronker.
Pasc. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
SIr William Bronker was brought before a Justice of Peace, upon an information
made, Habeas corpus, for one committed by a Justice of peace for refusing to
find sureties for the good behavior
that he had choated one at play with false dice: the Justice requires him to
find sureties for his good behavior, and upon his refusal commits him to
Prison. Sir William Bronker brings his habeas corpus in this Court, and upon
the retorn this matter appeared, the Prisoner prays by his council to be
delivered, because there appeared no matter sufficient upon the retorn why he
should be committed, but because the G^oler desired time to amend the retorn,
the Court granted it, and would not deliver the Prisoner, but took vail for his
appearance, viz. the Earl of Dover, Good behavior.
and Earl of Chesterfield. And the Court then said, that a Justice of Peace
cannot bind one to the good behavior upon a general information, or commit him
to Prison for refusing to find suretyes for his good behavior upon such
information. Imprisonment


VVroath and Elseye.
Pasc. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hill. 22 Car. rot. 1224.
AN Action of Debt was brought against Elseye an under Sheriff, by Wroath the
high Sheriff upon a bond given him to save him harmless, Demurer to a plea in
Debt upon an obligation.
etc. the Defendant pleads that he has saved him harmless, to this the
Plaintiff demurs, and held a good demurrer, for he ought to have pleaded non
damnificatus, and not generally that he has saved him harmless, for that he
may do in many things, and yet the Plaintiff may be damnifyed in some other
things where in he was also bound to save him harmless. The rule was to show
cause why Judgment should not be given for the Plaintiff.

White.
Pasc. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
A Judgment was given in an Action on the Case brought by an Attorney for
these words spoken of him; Error to rev^rse a Judgment in an Action on the Case
for words.
Thomas White is a perjured Knave, and a suborned Knave. A Writ of Error was
brought, and diverse exceptions taken, but the principal were two. 1. That the
words a^^ not well laid, for they are adjective words, and so not positive
enough to ground an Action. 2. The words are not Actionable, because it is not
declared, that the party of whom they were spoken was of any Trade, or had any
office: But Bacon Justice overruled all the exceptions, and ordered cause to

A Judgment was given in an Action of Debt upon an obligation, Error to
reverse a Judgment in Debt
to perform such a promise made by the Obligor, to the Obligee; and a Writ of
Error was brought to reverse this Judgment. The Error assigned was, that the
breach of the promise was not well assigned, for it did not appear when this
breach of promise was. Bacon Justice The breach of promise is the sole cause of
the Action, and it appears not to the Court when that was, and for this he
reversed the Judgment.

the Marshals Court, and for not appearing according to the condition was the
Action brought; Skeltrom appears and pleads, that at the time of the obligation
he was solus et innuptus. To this Plea the Plaintiff demurrs. Roll Justice
said, this Plea was not the same with ne unques loyalment accouple, for one

advised of the Plea. but Trin, 23 Car. ruled to show cause tomorrow why

SToughton an undersheriff brings an Action of Debt against Day one of his
Bailiffs, Demurrer upon a Declaration in Debt upon an Obligation.
upon an obligation with a condition to save the undersheriff harmless in
executing of processes, and other things contained in the condition, and
Assigns the breach of the condition to be, that the Bailiff had not Executed
such his warrant sent to him upon a process to him directed out of the
Exchequer to levy issues upon certain lands. To this declaration the Defendant
demurs, and shows for cause, 1. That the warrant to him directed by the
undersheriff, was made out of the County where he was undersheriff, and so
could not be said his warrant as undersheriff of that County. 2. It is not
alleged, that the manor of Addinson, where he was by the warrant to levy the
issues, is within the Hundred where the Bailiff has Jurisdiction; Warrant.
And this the Court held to be a good exception, and said, that the breach
Assigned is not showed to be within the Condition of the Obligation; because
the Baily cannot execute a precept out of the Hundred where he is Bailiff; and
Thereupon the rule was that the Plaintiff Nil capiat per billam, if cause were
not shown Tuesday following.

Cook and Fincham,

A Judgment was given for Cook, For vacating a Writ of Execution.
upon an information upon a Statute, exhibited by him on the behalf of the King
and himself, where the King was to have ten pounds of the penalty recovered:
Cook takes out an Execution upon this Judgment, to levy the whole sum of money
recovered to himself; as appeared to the Secondary upon examination of the
matter referred to him. Upon this the Court held the writ of Execution to be
ill; Execution.
because it was entire for the whole sum recovered to the party, whereas 10 l.
was due to the King, and ordered a new Writ of Execution, and to stay the money
in Court, till further advice of the matter taken.

by the Baron and Feme, and were converted ad usum suum, whereas it ought to be
in the plural number, to wit, ad usum eorum, or ad usum of Pew and his wife;
for as it was, it supposed the Conversion to be made only by the Husband, which
is contrary to the Action it self, which is brought against both. Upon this
Judgment was stayed till the other should move.

After a Verdict for the Plaintiff, it was moved in Arrest of Judgment, that
the Declaration ought to have been unum Acrum bosci, and not ligni, for that
was uncertain. The Court said, they would Advise of the exception, Declaration.
because it was in an Action of the Case The same Term Judgment was given,
because Damages only were to be recovered, and the words used were but
inducements to describe the thing for which Damages only were demanded, yet it
might have been more properly expressed.

THe Plaintiff brings an Action of Trespass, Arrest of Judgment in an Act^on

and declares against the Defendant for breaking his house, and taking away
quinque Instrumenta ferrea, Anglice, Fetters: and a verdict was for the
Plaintiff. It was moved in Arrest of Judgment, that the word Instrumentum is
not a word that signifies Fetters; but that it is so general a word that it may
express any other thing as well, and that the Anglice joined with it, to
interpret what it means, cannot help it, because there is a proper Latin word
which might and ought to have been used to express Fetters by Roll Justice
said, that by the Statute all pleadings ought to be in Latin. Pleadings.
and every particular thing therein ought to be expressed by a Latin word, if
there be a proper Latin word for it, as here there is, and therefore the proper
Latin word being not used, but another which cannot signify the thing, the
Anglice does no good; but part of the Declaration shall be judged to be in
English, and so it cannot be good. And judgment thereupon was stayed till the
other sold move.

etc. for the Plaintiff, and to teach him the trade of a mercer. This agreemet
was afterward by consent of both parties put into writing. Upon the trial the
Plaintiff obteins a Verdict upon the paroll agreement, and has Judgment
thereupon. The Defendant brings his Writ of Error in this Court, and Assigns
for Error, that there was no Assumpsit declared upon, or proved sufficient, to
warrant the Verdict and Judgment, because that by reducing the Agreement to
writing, the paroll agreement became ipso facto void, and so no Action could be
brought upon it; but it ought to have been brought upon the Agreement expressed
in the deed, and the issue ought to have been joined upon that, and not upon
the verbal Agreement, which is void. The rule of Court was to show cause why
Judgment should not be reversed.

the Action ought to have been brought particularly, against the other
Trespassors together with the Defendant, and not against the Defendant in
particular, with a general simul cum against the rest, which is uncertain, and
signifies nothing against the rest, and the rather, because the Action is
commenced by bill, and not by original; although it could not be good though it
were by original: but it was said by Roll Justice, that it may be the
Plaintiff could not Arrest the other Trespassors, Trespass.
and that he will do it when he can, and that he may well proceed against them
at diverse times as he can take them, but that whenever he shall have had
satisfaction for the Trespass done him from any one of them, he cannot proceed
against any of the rest; and it was ruled that Judgment should be entered.

The King and Holland
Entered 16 Car.
Argued Pasc. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe case was in effect this. An argument upon a special Ve^dict.
A Copyhold was surrendered to I. S. in trust, that Holland an Alien, should
take the profits thereof to his own use, and benefit, upon this an inquisition
was taken for the King, and this matter found: whereupon the lands were seized
into the Kings hands, and upon a trial concerning these lands, a special
Verdict was found, comprising the aforesaid matter. The case was argued against
the Kings Title, by Mountague of the Middle Temple, and for the Kings title, by
Hales of Lincolnes Inn. The substance of Mountagues Argument was, 1. To
consider the nature of the trust; 2. The nature of the land out of which the
trust was raised: and for the first he held, because it was a trust for an
Alien to take the profits of the land, and in that the Alien had no estate in
the land; therefore the King could not have it, as he might have had the land
if the Alien had had any Estate in it: and he said that this trust was a thing
only in Action, and lies in privity, and not to be seized upon by another; and
said a Villein was a parallel Person in law to an Alien, in respect of
purchasing of lands, and had a Copihold been surrendered thus in trust for a
Villein, the Lord should not have seized it; and this is but a trust not
Executed, which is in the nature of a use at the Common law, and not as it is
now by the Statute: besides, this trust is raised out of Copyhold lands, and
therefore the King cannot seize the lands which the Alien has not, for if he
should, the Lord of whom the land is held, would be prejudiced; and he cited
Beverlyes case 4. rep. 126, and a case in 23 Eliz: Hales on the other side
Argued, that the King shall have the trust, and laid these two grounds. 1. That
there may be a trust raised upon the surrender of a Copyhold; and 2ly. that the
surrender settles the trust in the Alien, and cited 11 H. 4.26. and he said
these things were considerable, 1. Whether the King shall have any thing, and
what he shall have; 2. Whether he shall have a use for an Alien at the Common
law, or a trust; 3. Whether he shall have a trust raised out of a use. And for
the first, he said, that the trust was not a thing merely in Action, but an
hereditament; and partly in possession. and cited Cooks Institutes 469. and
said, the reason why an Alien may not purchase lands is, because that this
Kingdom might not be impoverished thereby, by transporting the revenues of the
land into a foreign Country, and putting a part of it under the subjection of a
foreign Prince, and the same reason comes to the case in question, and therefore
is not to be suffered; and every Alien that purchases is said to purchase to
the use of the King, and so shall it be in this case, and although a thing
merely in Action is not transferable to a Common person, yet is it
transferrable to the King: but this case is stronger for the King, for here is
not a thing merely in Action but mixed with an interest, and it is no reason,
but that the law which was made to meet with the subtility of such Alien
purchasors, should take place here; and it cannot be said that that law was
made to give remedy to the King for that he had before, and a Feoffment now
made in trust for an Alien is all one with a use at the Common law; and he
cited 19. Jac. that trusts made to St. John Daccombe of Annuityes for the Lord
Summersett attainted of Treason were adjudged to be forfeited: and he held,
Daccombe.
that there is no difference between a trust raised out of a Copyhold and other
lands, and if he has an interest here in the profits, the seizure is good,
though he have no interest in the land, for the land may be seized by the
profits; 5 H. 5. fol. 9. Title.
But Roll Justice demanded of Hales, how the King shall be entitled to the
profits of the land, where he is not entitled to the land it self? and said,
that the Chancery cannot compel one to Execute a trust for an Alien, Chancery.
and that a trust was invented only to avoid the Statute of uses, and said,
that a trust is not a thing in Action, Trust.
but may be an inheritance or a Chatell as the case falls out. Adjourned postea.

White and Pynder.
Pasc. 23 Car. Banc. reg.
Mich. 22 Car. rot 440.
IN an Action of Trover and Conversion, Demurrer upon an evidence.
there was a demurrer joined upon the evidence; and thereupon the Court
directed the Jury to find damages for the Plaintiff, if upon the argument of
the demurrer the law should be adjudged for him, and then the parties desired
the Jury might be discharged, and referred the matter to the Judges, to
determine the law upon the evidence. In this case Roll Justice took this
difference, to wit between pleading of a Record, Record.
and giving a Record in evidence to a Jury. Plea.
If it be pleaded it must be sub pede sigilli, or else the Judges cannot judge
of it. But if it be given in evidence, though it be not sub pede sigilli, the
Jury may find it, Evidence.
if they have other good matter of inducement to prove it. And the parties in
this case were advised by the Court for their own expedition, to let there to
be issued a venire facias de novo, and to waive the demurrer upon the evidence,
because it was not good, nor could bring the matter in question before them
that they might determine it, for one party says there is a writ, and the
other says there is not a writ, which is bare matter of fact, and not for us
to determine but for a Jury, and the demurrer ought to have been whether the
writ be good or whether it be bad, and should have admitted that there was a
writ tyel quel, and then had the whole matter come legally before us, to wit,
whether the evidence given to the Jury be sufficient for them to find a verdict
for the Plaintiff upon the issue joined or not. But the Court will advise.

Hamond and Kingsmill.
Pasc. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
HAmond brings an Action upon the case against Kingsmill for these words,
Arrest of Judgment in an Action of the Case for words.
spoken of him in relation as he is a Justice of peace, to wit Mr. Hamond did
put in of his own head these words in an examination taken by him. viz. I. S.
did steal twenty sheep of such a man's, and for speaking these other words of
him; Hamond was a debauched man, and is not fit to be a Justice of peace, and
has a verdict against the defendant, who moves in Arrest of Judgment that
neither the former nor the latter words were actionable, for for the former
words, that he did of his own head put in words into the examination, are words
uncertain, and dubious what is meant by them, whether that he added any thing
of his own invention, to the examination which was not confessed by the
examinant, or that he only put the substance of the matter confessed into words
of his own endicting, and if he did no more that was justifiable, and so it
shall be taken here rather than in a worse, and strained construction to ground
an Action upon: and for the second words, to say that he was a debauched man,
and not worthy to be a Justice of peace, they cannot be scandalous, for they
are spoken of him in relation to what he was in time past, before he was a
Justice of peace, and not as he was at the time of the speaking, and it is no
scandal to say, a man has been debauched, for it may be he is now otherwise.
But for the first words it was answered by the Council on the other side, that
they were actionable, for they must be taken according to Common construction,
viz. that he had added not only words of his own invention to the examination,
but the matter it self expressed in those words which was not confessed by the
examinant. And as to the latter words, it was answered they were also
Actionable: and a Case was cited where Judgment was given against the
Defendant for saying of one, that he was a corrupt Judge. Roll Justice was of
opinion, Case.
that the first words were Actionable, but not the second for words says he
ought to be taken according to usual, and Common construction, though they are
not to be strained, for otherwise a man may be abused by subtility, and shall
have no remedy, and Judgment may be given here for the first words, Judgment.
and not for the second, the Damages being several, but if the Damages had
been entire there if Judgment could not be given for both the words, it cannot
be given at all. Bacon Justice much to the same purpose as Roll, and said,
that the first words shall be meant, that he added words of his own invention
without any instruction of the party, for oftentimes dubious words shall be
taken in the worse sense upon consideration of the Circumstances that accompany
them, and he was also of opinion that the second words were actionable, and are
as scandalous as the former. Judgment was given for the former words, and for
the latter the Court would advise.

exceptions not material at all were taken, and many others that were helped by

to be ad valentiam quingint. librar. instead of quingent. for there is no such
word as quingint, to express any number, for if it be meant to express Fifty,
it ought to be quinquagint, but quingent. signifies 500. 2ly. The Venire was
directed Balivis de Wapentagio, whereas there is no such word, for the word to
express a Wapentake is Wapentachium, so that it ought to be de Wapentachio, and
not Wapentagio. 3ly. The Venire is, Venire.

imprisoned the party, and that he is not bound to do, and yet the party may be

viz. meaning the Plaintiff) did steal my Wood, and I will send her to
Bridewell. It was moved in arrest of Judgment that the words were not
actionable, for doubtful words as these are ought to be taken in mitiori
sensu, and Wood here may be understood standing Wood, and not Wood cut down,
and so it could not be Theft but a Trespass: on the other side it was answered,
that Wood shall here be understood Wood cut down, and not standing, and being
coupled with the words Margaret VVhitacre is a Thief, which are scandalous
words, they shall be interpreted equally scandalous, Air and Higgins his Case
was cited to prove it, where it was adjudged that these words, He is a thief
and has stolen my Corn, shall be understood of Corn cut down, and not
standing, and therefore are actionable. Roll Justice said, it was a strong Case
that the action will lie. Case.
Notwithstanding Judgment was arested till the other should move. This was

and I will send her to Bridewell, It was again by the Plaintiff moved for
Judgment, because the words were actionable, and shall be meant of Wood cut
down and not standing; and it was said, though the first words should in
themselves be doubtful, yet are they made certain by the words that are
coupled with them. But Bacon Justice denied it and said, that Bridewell is a
Prison for Correction, and not the Sheriffs Prison for felons, and that one may
be sent thither although the offense be not felony, and that the cutting of
Wood standing is to be punished with whipping, and so the party may be sent to
Bridewell for that offense, and said, that the last words are explanatory of
the former, that he meant not the fact charged upon the Plaintiff to be felony,
but had not the later words been added to explain his meaning, the former alone
are clearly actionable. But Roll Justice held the words as they are laid to be
actionable, and cited Hyfords and Stamps Case, Trin. 11 Iac. and Doleman and
Youngs case, 5 Car. and Smith and Wards Case, 21 Iac. and said that in the Case
at Bar, that the latter words were cumulative and not interpretative, and that
where there are express precedent words to make one a Thief, there ought to be
violent words subsequent to give them another interpretation, and not words
which may be taken by implication, as they are in this Case. Adjourned.

Pasc. 23 Car. was again moved, which was this: Place was indicted before Finch
and Crawley Justices of Oyer and Terminer, for these words spoken against the
Queen mother of France, viz. the Queen mother is the Whore of Babylon, and is a
Whore, and has had a Bastard, and all the Noblemen that will not ioyn with me
against her, are Rogues and Rascals. To this endictment the Defendant pleaded,
and was found guilty by the Jury, and Judgment given against him: Whereupon he
brings his Writ of Error in this Court to reverse the Judgment, and Assigns
these Errors. 1. against the body of the Endictment it self, and that he ought
not to be Endicted for the words, because they are neither spoken against the
Common law nor against any Statute law. 2. Against the proceedings upon the
Endictment, which were against law, being too speedy, for he was Endicted
before Justices of Oyer and Terminer, and tried in one day, whereas there ought
to have been 15. days betwixt the preferring of the Endictment, and the trial.
3. The Venire is against law, for the Court did choose try, and swore the Jury,
which ought not to be. 4. Part of the Judgment is, that the Defendant shall be
bound to his good behavior, which cannot be upon such an Endictment as was
before them. 5. The Endictment does not say, that the words were spoken contra
pacem. 6. Part of the Judgment is, that he shall be set upon the Pillory, and
lose his cares, which no law warrants, but only to be set there to the view of
the people, Imprisonment
with a paper on his head. 7. The Judgment is that he shall be imprisoned for
a year without bail, which ought not to be. To this last exception the Court
answered, the party might be so committed; But they said, that the Justices of
Oyer and Terminer cannot try an Endictment the same day, nor Justices of peace
at the same Sessions in which it was preferred; Trial.
and they cited one Barnabyes Case 13 Car. and Pridians Case, 6 Car. and 22 E.
4. et Plow. 44. But they said Justices of Eyr, may try an Endictment the same
day; Roll Justice said, the Kings Bench is a Court of Eyr in the County where
it sits, Eyr.
and therefore they may try an endictment removed here out of the same County
the same day, but not if it be removed hither out of another County, for in
that case it is only a Court of Oyer and Terminer. But Bacon denied it, and
said so was my Lord Cooks opinion, and it was also said that Justices of Oyer
and Terminer cannot proceed upon an Endictment which is not taken before
themselves, but Iustcices of Gaol delivery may; and the Court also held, that
the juratores electi tryati et jurati by the Court, as it must necessarily be
here understood, Jury.
was illegal, for the Jury ought to be electi by the Sheriff out of the County;
and lastly the Court held, that legally there ought to have been 15 days
between the Endictment, and the trial, and for these reasons ordered to give
notice to the Kings Sollicitour, or Sergeant, to show cause why the Judgment
should not be reversed.

Hill and Farmer.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hill. 17 Car. rot. 674.
AN Action of Debt was brought in the Common pleas upon an obligation, Error in
Debt upon an obligation
and a Judgment upon a demurrer was given for the Plaintiff; the Plaintiff
brings a Writ of error in this Court to reverse the Judgment, and Assigns for
Error that the Obligation upon which the Action was brought, and Judgment was
given, is a void obligation by the Statute of quinto and sexto of Ed. 6. made
against buying of Offices. But Roll Justice answered, that the Judgment in the
Common pleas was given upon a mispleader there, and therefore you should make
that good first before you move new matter. And there is another Error also in
the pleading, which was not touched upon in the Common pleas, which is this,
first the plea is of the Office of the delivery, within the Office of the
Armory, Declaration.
and after he referrs the plea to the Office of the Armory which is another
Office, and so she Declaration is double. Another exception was that the word
Armentarius was used for Armamentarius. Monday following was given to show
cause why Judgment should not be reversed.

The King and Marshall.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
MArshall brings a Writ of Error to reverse a Judgment given against him upon
an Endictment of barratry, Error upon an Endictment.
and takes these exceptions. 1. That it does not appear in the Endictment,
before what Commissioners the Endictment was taken, upon which the Judgment
was given, and so the Endictment is not good for the incertainty of it, and
consequently the Judgment is erroneous that is given upon it, for it ought to
appear by the Endictment that it was taken before the Justices of Assise, or
Justices of Peace, or of the Jail-deliver. 2. The Judgment is, quod solvat
tantam denariorum summam, and shall find sureties for the good behavior, and
this is rather an award than a Judgment. To this exception Roll Justice
answered, Judgment.
if it be a good order it is a good Judgment, and the order is part of the
Judgment, yet let the Kings Council have notice, and the Prosecutor show
cause why the Judgment should not be reversed.

Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Upon a verdict given in an ejectione firmae it was moved in Arrest of
Judgment, Arrest of Judgment in an ejectione firmae.
and the exception was, that the Plaintiff was ejected de uno Crofto, which was
said to be of an uncertain signification; and because the Plaintiff conceived
the Court doubted whether an ejectione firmae lay of a Croft, he durst not
defend it, but moves for a special Judgment for the rest of the land contained
in the Declaration, and prayed that he might release the damages as to the
Croft. Roll Justice doubted whether an ejectione firmae lies de uno Crofto,
Ejectione firmae. Formedon, Assise.
and said that a Formedon lies not of a Croft, but that an Assise does, because
it is put in view to the recognitors, but a Praecipe lies not of it. The rule
of Court was, that the Plaintiff should take a special Judgment as he desired,
and release the Croft, and the damages to all, and that he should have his
Costs.

Lere and Cholwitch.
Pasc. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
LEre brings an Action of Debt upon an Obligation against Cholwitch; Arrest of
Judgment in Debt upon an Obligation.
the condition of the Obligation was, that a certain sum of money should be
paid to the Plaintiff 40 days after he should return with his Ship to such a
Port of discharge for freight for his Ship, and for non payment accordingly is
the Action brought; The Plaintiff has a Verdict, The Defendant moves in Arrest
of Judgment, and takes these exceptions. 1. That the averment of the breach of
the condition of the Obligation is not certain, and therefore not good, Freight.
for it does not aver that the Ship was discharged of his Goods, or that the 40
days were expired before the money demanded; To this Roll Justice said, it is
not usual to pay freight for a Ship, till the owners have their goods
delivered, but here the condition of the bond is, to pay the moneys within 40
days after his return to such a port of discharge, Intendment.
and it is not intended, that the money shall not be paid till the 40. days be
past. The 2d. Exception was, that he does not say where the Ship was unloaden;
To this Roll answered, that it shall be intended that it was unladen at the
port where she arrived, if the contrary be not shown on the other side. 3ly.
There is no notice expressed to be given of the unloading of the Ship, Notice.
and this being a collateral thing, and penal to the Defendant, he ought to
have notice of it; To this Roll said, that one party might as well take notice
of this as the other, for the thing to be done is not to be done either by the
Plaintiff, or Defendant, and the issue is found against the Defendant,
therefore let him show cause Tuesday next why Judgment should not be given for
the Plaintiff. Afterward the same Term Judgment was given accordingly.

Segar and Dyer.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Mich. 22 Car. rot. 125. or 135
DYer brings an Action of Trover and Conversion, Error to reverse a Judgment in
Trover and Conversion.
in the Court at Bristow against Segar, and has a Verdict, and a Judgment
against him; Segar brings his Writ of Error in this Court to reverse this
Judgment, and Assigns these Errors. 1. To the Declaration which was of the
Trover, and Conversion, de uno pollo, Anglice a Colt, whereas Pullus signifies
not a Colt, but properly a young Hen, and hence we had the word pullet but in a
general acception of the word it may signify also other young things, but then
it must have an adjective of the species which it is to signify, or a
substantive of the gentive case joined with it, as pullus equinus, pullus
Asininus or Asini and the like, and ought not to be used alone to signify a
colt, with an Anglice joined to it, as it is here. The 2d. Exception was, that
it is not well set forth, how the Court was held where the Judgment was given,
for he does not show that the Court was held either by letters patents, or by
praescription, but says ad curiam tentam tali die coram A. D. I. H. etc. a
tempore cujus contrarium memoria hominum non existit, etc. prescription.
which cannot be a good praescription, for a Court cannot be held at such a
day, and before such particular persons, if it be not expressed to be secundum
consuetudinem. The rule of Court was to show cause Tuesday following why the
judgment should not be reversed.

Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Plaintiff declares that the Defendant had covenanted with him, Demurrer
upon a Declaration in an Action of Covenant.
to pay him so much money as he should expend for repairing, and victualling a
Ship for him, and averrs that he had expended 300 l. in repairing and
victualling it, and that he gave the Defendant notice of it at such a day, and
for non payment he brings his Action of breach of Covenant. The Defendant
protestando that the Plaintiff had not laid out 300 l. in manner and form as he
had declared, demurs to the Declaration upon these exceptions. 1. That that the
Declaration was not good, because he had not averred a special breach of
Covenant: But to this Roll Justice said, that this exception had been often
overruled. 2ly. It was objected, that in this case the Plaintiff should have
brought an Action of Debt, Election of Action.
and not of Covenant. But to this also Roll answered, that it was well enough,
for it is in the election of the Plaintiff to bring either an Action of Debt,
or an Action of Covenant, and that it has been heretofore questioned, whether
an Action of Debt did lie in this case, but it was never doubted but that an
Action of Covenant did very well lie. Debt.
A third exception was that there is no request alleged to pay the money, and
without request he was not bound to pay it. Demand
To this Roll answered, that the Plaintiffs Action was not an Action of Debt
where a Demand is necessary, but it is an Action of Covenant, and there it is
not needful to allege a Demand.

Boomer and Payte.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. reg.
PAyte the Administrator of the Goods and Chattels of I. S. brings an action of
Debt against Boomer, Demurrer upon a Declaration in Debt.
and declares, that the Intestate brought an action of Debt in the Common Pleas
against three, and had a Judgment against them, and a Capias ad satisfaciendum
against two of them was directed to Boomer the Defendant, being then Sheriff of
the Countywhere the parties lived, to execute, and that accordingly he did
execute it by taking the parties, and afterward did suffer them to escape, and
for this the Plaintiff brings his Action. Debt.
To this Declaration the Plaintiff demurs. But Roll Justice said, he saw no
cause for it, for an Administrator may have an action of Debt against a Sheriff
upon an Escape suffered of a Prisoner of the Intestate in his life time, and
ordered the Defendant to show cause Tuesday next why the Plaintiff should not
have Judgment.

The City of London and Estwick.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
STephen Estwick prays a Writ of Restitution to be restored to the place of a
Common-Councel-man of the City of London, For restitution to the place of a
Common-Councel-man of London.
being put out of it by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, and also
committed to Newgate; the Writ is granted and directed to the Lord Mayor and
Court of Aldermen, who thereupon make a logn retorn, setting forth at large the
causes why he was deprived and committed, and why he ought not to be restored,
which in brief was for carrying himself in a tumultuous way at an election of
Common-Councell-men, and disturbing the election; this Retorn was read and
filed, and the Council thereupon prayed he might be restored, because there was
not sufficient matter showed in the Retorn why he should not be restored, and
these exceptions were taken to the Retorn. 1. That it was too general, and
shows not what manner of disturbance Estwick made at the Court where the
election was. 2ly. Part of his misdemenour is set forth to be clamando and
veciferando, which are words very uncertain and not proper to set forth a
disturbance. 3ly. It was said he was bidden to withdraw, and refused, and it is
not shown why he should withdraw. 4ly. The custom set forth for the Lord Mayor
and Court of Aldermen to imprison ad placitum is not good, but they should have
shown that such imprisonment belonged to them per consuetudinem, or by the
Common Law. 5ly. They say, that they had used to imprison for such causes, and
do not show where the custom is used. 6ly. They say quaedam quaestio orta est
touching the election of one to be a Common-Councel-man, and show not his
ability for the place. 7ly. By the incertainty of the Retorn the Plaintiff
cannot plead to it. 8ly. It is said, that when he was commanded to go forth, he
said he would not, but it is not said that he did not go forth. 9ly. It is said
that the Court of Common Counsel tendered the Covenant, whereas they have no
power by Ordinance of Parliament to do it. The Recorder of Council with the
City desired time to amend the Retorn in matter of form only. And said, that
the Plaintiff was removed from his place by a Court of Record, and therefore
hoped he should not be this way restored, and that he had no loss by being
removed, and therefore the Case was the less considerable; and whereas it was
objected against his amending of the Reton, that it was filed, and so too late
to move for it, He said, that it was not filed by order of Court, but only
ordered that Copies might be taken of it for Council to peruse, and if so then
it is not too late to pray it may be amended, but though it were filed he
conceived that in a case of this importance it might be amended in matter of
form as some Reforms had been formerly in this Court. Roll Justice answered the
Recorder to this effect, You ought to show some cause upon which the party may
have remedy by a Writ of Error, or otherwise, Return.
if Judgment be wrongfully given against him, which you have not done; and as
to the filing of the Retorn, Filing.
a Retorn may be filed either upon motion of the party, or by the rules of the
Court, and it were good, you consider how this was filed; and as touching the
suspension of the party from his place, Suspension.
it ought not to be perpetual but for a time only, and said, that after filing
of a Retorn, be it upon motion or by the rules of the Court, it cannot be
amended. Tuesday next following was given by the Court to hear Council on both
parts. Amendment.


Chadly and Stinch.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Mich. 22 Car. rot. 556.
STinch brought an Action upon the Case upon an Assumpsit in the Common Pleas
against Chadly, and has a Verdict and a Judgment. Error to reverse a Judgment
in an Action upon an Assumpsit.
Stinch brings a Writ of Error here to reverse this Judgment, and assigns for
Error. 1. That there were 18 returned upon the Jury, and but two of them tried
the issue. 2ly. Part of Declaration to ground the Assumpsit was in another
County, and not within the Jurisdiction of the Court where the issue was tried;
and for these Errors the Judgment was reversed except cause should be shown to
the contrary Thursday next.

Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
IT was moved to quash an Endictment for erecting of a Cottage contrary to the
Statute; To quash an Endictment for erecting a Cottage.
the exception taken to it was, that he erected a Cottage for habitation, but
did not say it was used or inhabited as a Cottage. But Bacon Justice answered,
that the very erection of it is an offense against the Statute, and therefore
the Endictment did very well pursue the words of the Statute, and therefore
would not quash it.

Wright and Pynder.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Mich. 22 Car. rot. 440 antea. 22
THe Case of Wright and Pynder was moved again to have the Judgment of the
Court. Opinion of the Court on a Demurrer upon an evidence.
Roll Justice said, that matter of fact ought to be agreed in a Demurrer to an
Evidence, otherwise the Court cannot proceed upon the Demurrer, for the Judges
cannot try the matter in fact, for that were for the Judges to give the
verdict, which belongs to the Jury to do, and to waive the matter in Law,
Pleading.
which they should determine, and he said, that if a Deed be pleaded the party
must show it in Court, but if it be given in evidence it is not necessary to
show it if it can otherways be proved to the Jury, Evidence.
and so is it of a Record given in evidence, and cited one Worsseys Case 17
Iac. Rolls Justice took also two other Exceptions to the pleading, 1. That the
Goods mentioned in the Schedule appear not to be the same contained in the
Declaration. 2ly. No Title is made to the Indenture by him who brings the
Action, and concluded upon the whole matter that the Demurrer was not good, and
that there ought to be a Venire facias de novo to try the matter again. Venire
de novo. Judgment.
Bacon Justice much to the same effect, but differed in this, that there ought
not to be a Venire facias de novo but said, that Judgment ought to be given
against one party, to wit the Defendant, for ill joining in Demurrer, to the
intent the party that is not in fault may be dismissed, and the parties here
have waived the Trial per pays by joining in Demurrer. But Roll answered that
no Judgment at all could be given, for both parties be in fault, one by
tendering the Demurrer, the other by joining in it, and the Defendant might have
chosen whether he would have joined or no, but might have prayed the Judgment
of the Court whether he ought to join. The Court advised to search presidents
for a Venire facias de novo after a Demurrer upon an evidence, and if there be
any, they held that the same Jury ought to come again, and not another. Roll
said, Jury.
if a special verdict be found insufficient, a new Venire facias ought to
issue, and he saw no difference between that and this Case.

King and Summerland.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
IN the Case of King and Summerland again moved, the Court held that the
pleading of a bargain and sale to be debito modo irrotulatum secundum formam
statuti is good enough, Opinion of the Court touching pleading of an Enrollment.
though it be not pleaded to be enrolled within six months, yet ruled it should
be moved again. The same term Judgment was given, that the Plaintiff nil
capiat per billam, because the Deed was not said to be enrolled, neither
secundum formam statuti, nor within six months, but only debito modo, which may
be an Enrollment at the Common law, and not according to the Statute.

The City of London and Estwick.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court was again moved in the Case between the City of London and Estwick,
Argument concerning the Writ of Restitution to a common-Councel-mans place.
Amendment.
that the return of the City might be amended although it were filed, because
there are Presidents where it has been done. Roll Justice answered, there was
never any amended after the filing before H. 7ths. time. It was replied by the
Council, that the return being of this Term it might be amended, for it rested
in the breast of the Judges. But Roll Justice answered to this, that Acts of
the Court remain in the breast of the Court the same Term, but not acts of
others, and therefore this being so was not amendable, and said, that inferior
Courts cannot amend a presentment in matter of fact, for that were to alter the
custom of the courts; and it was then said, that Endictments had been amended
after the filing of them. And Alderman Langhams Case was also urged, where a
retorn of the City was amended after it was filed, yet this was ruled not
amendable. Twisden of Council with the City argued that Estwick ought not to be
restored to his place of a Common-Councel-man for these reasons. 1. Because it
was not a place of profit, and so it was no damage to him to be removed, and
therefore his suit was to no purpose. 2ly. It is not a place of Government, and
so no dignity in it, but it was a place merely of service and trouble. But Roll
Justice answered, that a writ of restitution had been adjudged good to restore
a Constable to his place, Restitution.
which was more a place of service and trouble than this. 3ly. There is a
judgment against Estwick in a Court of Record, and it must be avoided either
by error or attaint, as the Statute directs, and the party cannot be restored
by a Writ of Restitution; and for the objection, that the Return is too
general, he answered, that Faith is to be given, that there was a disturbance
made by him as is suggested, though it be not so plainly expressed as it might
have been. 2ly. Here appears a contempt to the Court, and for this he may be
suspended. 3ly. The Custom is well pursued upon the whole matter taken
together. 4ly. The Custom is well laid for the commitment ad placitum, for it
refers to the words suspendere vel amovere, that is, either one or the other.
5ly. The word require amounts to a command being spoken in a Court of Record,
and the disobeying it was a contempt. Hales of Council on the same side argued
much as Twisden had done, and added to it as followeh. 1. That there appears a
reasoanble cause precedent why he should be suspended, and then it follows they
may suspend him ad libitum. 2ly. The alleging of the disturbance is not
material, for that is not the ground of his a motion from his place, but only
the inducement to it. 3ly. Requisitus shall be understood requisitus per
curiam, it being alleged to be in Court. 4ly. Recusavit is more than denegavit,
and implies he did not the thing enjoined him, and so might well be committed.
5ly. There may be cause to grant a Writ of restitution, though no cause for the
restitution: For a common-Councel-man of Coventry had a Writ of restitution out
of this Court, and yet upon his suit was not restored. The Recorder moved for a
longer day to be heard for the City, because it was a weighty cause, and said
that no restitution could be made, for the Writ was not well directed, and so
is not well executed. The Plaintiffs Council desired expedition in the Cause;
Whereupon Roll said, here has been no delay in the business, but the rule is
against you, and he took these exceptions to the Retorn. 1. It appears not by
the retorn that the Plaintiff is removed from his place, but only that he is
suspended, and then he may well be restored, and it is not said for how long
time he is suspended. 2ly. It is not said that he is suspended for a reasonable
cause. 3ly. It is not said what the disturbance was that he made for which he
is suspended. And further said, that the Court of the Common Counsel is not a
Court of Record, Error. Restitution.
for no Writ of Error lies there, but is a Court only of Advise. Bacon Justice
as Roll, and said, that Estwick had only remedy to be restored by a Writ of
Restitution, and not by a Writ of Error or an Attaint. Adjourned till Saturday
to hear Council for the City.

Rawson and Bargue.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hill. 17 Car. rot. 904.
RAwson brought an Action of Debt against Bargue for 15 l. upon the Statute of
2 Ed. 6. for setting forth of Tithes. Argument upon a special Verdict for
Tithes in an action of Debt upon the Statute of 2 Ed. 6.
And upon the Trial a special verdict was found, wherein the Question was,
whether the Church by reason whereof the Tithes were claimed were a free
Chapel, and given to Ed. the 6th. by the Statute of 1 Ed. 6. and so discharged
of Tithes or not. Walker of Council with the Plaintiff argued, that it was not
a free Chapel, because there was a cure of Souls, and so could not be free but
presentative, and said that the word free was a word of distinction to
distinguish things of different nature one from another, as liber homo is to
distinguish a free maa from a villein, Francksold, Francktenement, and the
like, and cited Bracton lib. 4. C. 3. 241. He likewise distinguished Chapels
into three sorts. 1. Donative. 2ly. Presentative. 3ly. Without cure of Souls,
and said, that Chapels presentative were not given to the King by the Statute
of ^ Ed. 6. and cited Not. brev. 48. and 13 E. 4. f. ^. and 6 H. 7. c. 14. and
5 H. 7. f. 37. and said, that it is not within the meaning of the Statute of 1
Ed. 6. to give Chapels presentative, because it is not within the mischief
which the Statute was made to prevent, and so intends not to give Chapels with
cure of Souls, and the word free is but nominal, and does not make it free if
it be not so otherwise. Hales for the Defendant argued, that it was a free
Chapel within the Statute of 1 Ed. 6. For first it is called so, and it shall
be presumed it is rightly named so. 2ly It is so found to be by the Jury, and
to prove that it is a free Chapel it is not presentative, and 2ly. It appears
not to be within the Jurisdiction of the Ordinary. 3ly. The Act of 1 Ed. 6. is
an Act which is general and gives all free Chapels, and extends as well to
Chapels which are only reputative free Chapbels as well as to them which are
so indeed, even as it is of a Chauntery, College, and an impropriation, as the
Books are, and it is a free Chapel nevertheless it be presentative and with
the cure of Souls, for a free Chapel may now be with the cure of Souls,
although by the old Canon law it could not, as was held in Child's case, 1 Iac.
The Chapel within the Tower is a free Chapel donative, and yet it is
presentative and has cure of Souls, so says Lynwood of the free Chapel of
St. Martins. It is also the intent of the Statute, that it should be so, for a
College and a Chauntery with cure are within the Statute, as may appear by the
Exceptions of the Statute of the Free Chapel with cure of Souls in the Isle of
Eely called the Chapel of the Sea, and the being presentative with cure
hinders not, but that it may be within the Statute, for the presentation might
arise at the first by special composition, as it is 13 E. 4. f. 4. and Register
f. 307. and it was instanced in the free Chapel of Hastings in Sussex, and it
may be a Chapel donative by prescription, and yet presentative. Adjornatur ad
proximum terminum to be argued again. Vid. postea.

Barker and Martyn.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe case between Barker and Martyn was again moved, Arest of judgment in
Trepass.
which was briefly this, An action of Trespass was brought by Barker against
Martin, wherein he declares, that the Defendant had broken his House, and had
taken away quinque instrumenta ferrea, Anglice fetters. In arrest of Judgment
exception was taken to the Declaration. that Instrumenta serrea, Anglice
fetters, was not a good expression in Latin (as it ought to be) of Fetters,
because there was a proper Latin word for Fetters, namely Compes, so that it
ought to have been quinque Compedes, or quinque paria Compedum, and not as it
is, for the word Instrumentum is uncertain, and may be used to signify any
thing else with an Anglice added to it as well as Fetters, and as it is the
pleading is not all in Latin as the Statute directs to avoid Barbarsm, and the
word Anglice when it is properly used in a Declaration is to help words of art,
which cannot be expressed without (...) Anglice, and is not to be used where
there is a proper Latin word to signify the thing, as in this Case there is.
On the other side it was said, that general words might be good in a
Declaration, and barbarous words sometimes, and cited Hobarts Reports, 267. and
Ward and Smiths Case, Trin. 4. Iac. rot. 2305. Roll Justice, It is a hard thing
to maintain this Declaration, Declaration.
for if it should be admitted good it would bring in all Barbarism in
pleadings, Pleading.
and any senseless word might be used with an Anglice joined with it, and he
said one was endicted for using quandam artem Anglice of a Draper, and it was
adjudged naught, and in the case between Tailour and Taylour 9 Car. Trespass,
was brought pro December caponibus, Anglice Capons, and avidbus domesticis,
Anglice powltry, and adjudged not good. Yet the rule of the Court was to argue
it again Saturday next following.

Eeles and Lambert.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Pasc. 22 Car. rot. 1646.
EEles brought an Action of Covenant against Lambert the Executor of Sir Molton
Lambert, An Action of Covenant against an Executor.
and declares that Sir Molton Lambert did in his life time by his indenture let
certain lands unto him for years, and covenanted thereby for himself, his
Executors, Administrators, and Assigns, that the Lessee should not be put out
of possession of the lands let by him during the said Term, and that since the
death of Sir Molton Lambert his Lessor, he was put out of possession by such an
one, and upon this he brings his Action of Covenant against the Executor. The
Defendant pleads, no Assets, upon this an issue was joined, and a special
Verdict was found, To this effect, That Sir Molton Lambert did let the lands
mentioned in the Declaration to Eeles prout, and that there was such a Covenant
in the Deed prout, and that the Plaintiff was put out of possession of the
lands prout. They find likewise, that Sir Molton Lambert made his Will, and
made the Defendant his Executor, and died; that Sir Molton Lambert by his will
gave many legacies of goods, and that the Defendant before the Plaintiff was
put out of possession, did pay all the Legacies in kind, and that besides those
Legacies he had not Assets to discharge the Covenant. Upon this Verdict the
matter in Law was this, whether the Executor ought to have forborne the payment
of the Legacies, and to have expected till the end of the Term let to the
Plaintiff, or till the Covenant had been broken, and for doing otherwise should
not be charged with the Covenant de bonis propriis; or whether the Covenant not
being broken in the life of the Testator, nor before the Legacies paid, he had
not paid the Legacies as he ought, and should not be freed from being charged
with the Covenant de bonis propriis. Upon opening of the Case Roll Justice
said, that a decree in Chancery against an Executor, Decree in Chancery.
shall not be satisfied before an Obligation made by the Testator, and become
due after his death. Saturday following was set to here Council again.

Jones and Stanley.

Jones brought an Action of Debt upon an Obligation to perform Covenants of an
Indenture against Stanley, Arest of Judgment in an ACtion of Debt.
and has a Verdict against him; Stanley moves in Arrest of Judgment, and
takes these exceptions; 1. That the Goods valued in the Declaration, are not
within the condition of the Obligation; 2. The goods are not certainly set
forth what they are, for the Declaration is of diverse parcells of old stuff; 3.
Some of the things mentioned in the Declaration are not goods, and so not to be
valued, for the Declaration is of partitions withint he house, and of a shed,
which are part of the free hold, and not goods; upon these exceptions the
Judgment was arrested till the other should move it:

White and Thomas.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. 18 Car. rot. 1400.
WHite binds himself, Error to reverse a Judgment in Debt brought by an Heir.
his Heirs, Executors, and Administrators, in an Obligation to Thomas for the
payment of a certain sum of money, at a certain day, the money is not paid, a
Judgment is obtained against White for the money, White makes his will, and
makes his Heir at law his Executor, and dies leaving lands to descend. White as
Heir brings a Writ of Error to reverse this Judgment; It was argued by the
Council of the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error, that the Writ did lie, because
although the Action in the former Judgment was but a personal Action, yet in
this Case, the Land of the Heir may be charged by the Judgment, Heir. Elegit.
for an elegit may be thereupon taken out to charge ^is Lands, and therefore
the Judgment concerns him as Heir as well as Executor, and therefore it is
reason he should bring a Writ of Error to reverse the Judgment, because he may
be prejudiced by it. Executor.
And a Case in Trin. 29 Eliz. rot. 631. Banc. Reg. was cited, that the Heir is
pridy to the Judgment, and therefore shall have a Writ of Error, Error.
and he is not merely terr-Tenant 13 E. 4.2. Roll Justice, the terr-Tenant sole
shall not have a Writ of Error upon an extent; Error.
And in the Case at the bar the Heir is not privy to the Judgment, and the
extent is only upon him as terr-Tenant, and he is not made privy to the
Judgment by the extent, but after Execution he may have a Writ of Error, and
he said, Bail.
the Bail cannot bring a Writ of Error upon the Judgment given against the
Principal, and the same reason is here, and it will be very hard to maintain
this Writ of Error. Adjourned to the next term.

TErry brings an Action of Debt upon an Assumpsit against Baxter, Demurrer upon

to stand to an Award. The Defendant pleads null arbitrament; the Plaintiff sets
forth the award, and assigns a breach; The Defendant demurs, and for cause
shows that part of the award was to pay 5 l. to the poor of the Parish of D.
which was not within the submission, and so the award was not good. Roll
Justice answered, if the award be void to the 5 l. Award good in part i; a good
award.
awarded to be paid to the poor, yet it is good to the rest, for it is perfect
as to the ending of all differences between them which are submitted, and
therefore show cause on Monday next, why judgment should not be given for the
Plaintiff.

Pasc. 23 Car. rot. 50.
Webb brings an Action upon the Case against Morefield in the palace Court at
Westminster, Error to reverse a Judgment in an Action upon the Case.
and has a Judgment; Morefield brings a Writ of Error in this Court to
reverse the Judgment, and Assigns these Errors. 1. It is not showed in the
Declaration that the cause of Action was infra jurisdictionem palatii. But
Roll Justice answered, Jurisdiction.
that it was showed to be infra jurisdictionem Curiae, and that was good
enough, for the Court is alleged to be held by Letters patents. Retorn.
A 2d. Exception was, that there was not fifteen days for the retorn of the
Venire facias as there ought to be; But to this Roll Justice also answered,
that the Court is held by Letters patents, and therefore it may be retornable
within fifteen days, though by the usual course of the Common law it cannot.
And therefore ordered the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error to show better matter,
otherwise Judgment should be affirmed against him.

The King and Holland.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Case between the King and Holland was moved again, For quashing an
inquisition for the King. Inquisition.
and the Council against the King, moved that the inquisition found for the
King to entitle him to the use of the Copyhold might be quashed, because the
King cannot be entitled to such a use, because it is a thing in privity only,
and cited the Statute of 27 H. 8. of uses, Cooks 1. rep. 123, and said, that
the King cannot be entitled ot Copyhold lands of an Alien much less to the use
of Copyhold lands; Copyhold. King. VVrong. Protection. Trust.
if he should, 1. The Lord would be wronged, which the King ought not to do,
but to protect his subjects, for the protection of the subject, is not only
matter of honor to the King, but also of trust in the Crown; 2ly. A stranger
is wronged by it; 3ly. The Copyholder of the Manor cannot have remedy for the
injury done him, Suit.
for he ought to sue in the Lords Court, and not else where, and here he cannot
do it, and the rule in law is de minimis non curat lex, and it is much less
for the honnour of the King to have a Copyhold estate, Honor.
which is a base tenure. But it may be objected, that if the King shall not
have this use, he shall be in a worse condition than a subject. To this it is
answered, that he shall be so in cases which touch his royalty, and may be a
disparagement to him, Copyhold.
which indeed does not make him in a worse condition though it may seem so, but
it is more for his honor, and a Copyhold is an estate at the will of the Lord,
and ought to be protected by the Lord; and the King cannot be Tenant at will to
any, Alien. Trust.
and therefore cannot have a Copyhold estate; and an Alien is not capable of a
trust, because it is a thing in Action which an Alien cannot have, and
therefore he cannot derive it from him. Twisden for the King in his Argument
considered, 1. Whether the King can have a use at the Common law which is for
an Alien. 2. Whether a trust differs from a use; for the first he said, that an
Alien may purchase lands. Alien. Praerogative.
and a use at the Common law, but he cannot retain them, therefore the King
shall have them by his Praerogative, and a use is not a thing in privity, but
is an Ancient inheritance at the Common law. 2ly. There is no confidence
annexed to cestui que use, or to the Feoffor, but may be disposed of. 3ly.
Things privity in Action may be given to the King, Privity.
and a use is an inheritance in the nature of a Chattell. 4ly. A use is
grantable over, Privity.
and therefore may be given to the King, and the meaning of the word lost, in
the Statute, is to be intended that it may be lost for the difficulty of
finding such subtle conveyances, and not that the right was really lost: Trust.
And for a trust it is but a new name given to a use, and invented to Defraud
the Statute of uses, and a trust of a Copyhold is all one with another trust,
for it is the taking of the profits of the land, and not the Estate in the
land, and the King shall have it; And to that which is said that the King
cannot be a Copyholder, it is not so clear; for I conceive the contrary: for a
surrender of a Copyhold to him is good, and of a use too: and he cited these
books, 9 H, 6. fol. 25.20 B. 3. f. 3.11. rep. 91. Roll Justice said, that a
Trustee or cestuy que trust cannot take the profits of the land, Cestuy que
trust. Equity. Outlawry. Law and Equity.
but has only his remedy in equity, for the Estate in the land is only in the
party trusted; and the King shall not have the profits of the land upon an
Out-lawry against the cestuy que use, or cestuy que trust. And Law and Equity
ought not to be confounded; therefore if the King has equity for a thing, he
ought not to sue for it at the Common law, so is it in this case at the bar.
Adjourned.

Chapel and Drew.
23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hill. 11 Car. rot. 921.
IN this case the party being attainted of felony, Exception to a pardon for
Felony. Pardon.
pleaded his Charter of Pardon and Claims, thereby to be restored to his Goods
and Chattels forfeited to the King by the felony; and the Question was, whether
as the Pardon was penned he should be restored or no? the words of the Pardon
upon which the Question grew, were these, pardonavit, remisit, and relaxavit,
and it was held, that he was not by these words to be restored to his Goods and
Chattels; for the words do not amount to a Surrender in case of a ommon person,
much less in case of the King, and there ought to have been the word restituit.
Roll Justice said, this Pardon was drawn by Noy, Attorney General, and was too
short, Felony. Trial.
and it was said by him that if one be committed to the Gaol for one felony,
the Justices may enquire and try the party for another felony for which he was
not committed.

Tylers Case.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
AN action of Debt was brought against Tyler upon an Obligation to stand to an
Award, Demurrer to a Replication
and the Plaintiff declares of an Arbitrament made the 28th, day of May in such
a year, ready to be delivered up the nine and twentyeth day of May in the same
year; The Defendant pleads nullum Arbitrium, The Plaintiff replies, that the
Award was made by the Vmpire the 28th. of May ready to be delivered up upon the
same 28th. day of May, and to this replication the Defendant demurs, and shows
for cause, that the Plaintiff had set forth double matter, one in his
Declaration, and the other in his Replication; for the Award set forth in the
Declaration, and that set forth in the Replication cannot be intended to be one
and the same. But Roll Justice answered, that the Issue to be tried, is not to
be taken upon the day of the Award made, and therefore it requires no answer,
Demmurres.
and so cannot be double, and one ought not to demur for the doubleness of the
matter upon a thing upon which no Issue can be taken, and ^^led better matter
should be shown, or else Judgment should be given for the Plaintiff.

Estwick and the City of London.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Case of Estwick and the City of London was again argued by Sergeant Glynn
for the City; Argument in the Case of the Writ of Restitution to a
Common-Councel-mans place. Restitution. Custom.
in his Argument he insisted upon three particulars why Estwick could not be
restored to his place of a common-Councel-man. 1. That a common-Councel-man may
be removed or suspended from his place at pleasure by the custom of the City.
2ly. That he cannot be restored by Law. 3ly. No restitution can be in this case
as it now stands. First, the custom to remove a common-Councel-man is good, for
it first began by agreement, and such a custom is good at the common law, much
more here, and it is not an unreasonable custom, although it may seem so prima
facie, like as it is in the case of a Lord that feiseth the Lands of his
Villein, and in the case of a Copyholder that for feiteth his Estate by the
felling of Timber. A second reason is, it agrees well with the nature and
condition of the office of a common-Councel-man to be subject to this Custom,
Trial.
and we know that many things shall be tried by Custom, contrary to the course
of the common law. 3ly. We see that the order of the Parliament is a rule to
try matters concerning their Members, and so it is here in the City to try
their Members. 4ly. If it should not be so, it would prove destructive to the
City, by waiting till such an offender might be removed by a course in Law,
which is far more tedious than this customary way. To the second point, he
said, that by Law there can be no restitution to this office, and this is
proved by the very nature of the Writ of Restitution, which is to restore the
party to a freehold or some other matter of profit, neither of which can be in
our case, and a writ of Restitution is to restore one to a possession, where
one may not be restored by an ordinary way, neither does the Statute of Magna
charta extend to our case: for a common-Councel-mans place is merely grounded
upon the custom of the City, and not upon the Common law: and he said there
are three grounds for a Writ of Restitution. 1. A contempt to the King. 2ly. A
hurt to the Commonwealth. 3ly. Particular damage to the party; but none of
these is in our cause, and therefore there is no cause for a Writ of
Restitution. The case of Sir James Baggs having a Writ of Restitution was,
because he was deprived of his Trade and Freedom, Constable. Church warwarden.
and freehold, and our case differs from the case of a Constable, or a Church
warden, or any case that can be cited; for a Church warden is an officer in
relation to the Common wealth for the execution of Justice, whereof the Common
law takes notice, and likewise a Constable is a known Officer to minister
Justice in relation to the public: Recorder.
so is it of a Recorder of a Corporation, and so they all differ from our case.
For authority to this point in 17. Iac. but moved first 16 Iac. Warren a
common-Councel-man of Coventry was denied upon the retorn of his Writ to be
restored, and our case and retorn is more strong against the Plaintiff; and
Burman a Gentleman of one of the Inn of Court, being expelled, could not be
restored by a Writ of Restitution, and lately a common-Councel-man was removed
for not taking the Protestation. For the third point, whether upon the Writ it
self, as this case is, there can be any restitution made? I conceive not,
because it is directed to the Mayor and Commonalty, and Citizens of the City of
London, and so there is in it a false recital of the suspension; Recital.
for he was not removed by the Citizens, and so the Writ is directed to parties
who did not the wrong, and so it is ill directed, and it differs from the
direction of the Writ in Sir James Bags case, and it ought to have been
directed to the Sheriffs or Ministers who have authority to restore him, as
they did remove him, for the party that has done no wrong ought not to be
punished or molested; and for the ill direction of the Writ could not Warren
the common-Councel-man of Coventry he restored, and the Corporation of London
is responsable for all particular Misdemeanors done within any Courts of
Justice within the City, or other general Misdemeanors there committed.
Misdemeannours.
Maynard on the other side argued, that the case was mistaken as it is stated
in the Retorn, for it supposes that the party is removed at pleasure, and yet
supposes also, that there is a cause to remove him, to wit his refusing to go
out, and expresses not that he did not go out, nor that he was commanded to go
out, but that he was requested. And whereas it is more than to advise, for he
has a privilege for his own good, and the good of the City. 3ly. The Writ is
well directed, and cannot be otherwise for the party to have remedy, and all
the Presidents are as this is, Presidents.
and Alderman Harris his case is the same in point with this, where it was by
three Judges resolved, that he should be restored to his Aldermans place,
because it was a place of Honor as well as of Burden. Roll Justice said, 1.
That the Writ was well directed. 2ly. That the custom was ill recited, 3ly, If
it were well recited, yet it is a void custom. 4ly. The Retorn is not good, for
the incertainties of it, viz. in the causes showed, why the party was removed,
and therefore that he ought to be restored to his place. Bacon Justice to the
same intent, and said, that wheresoever a Commissioner or other person has
power given to do a thing at his discretion, it is to be understood of sound
discretion, and according to Law, Discretion. Jurisdiction.
and that this Court has power to redress things otherwise done by them. The
rule was, that the party be restored, if better matter be not shown Tuesday
following.

Trespass.
and carrying away 200 load of soil, It was moved in arrest of Judgment, that
it should have been of soil inde provenient. and that an intendment cannot make

generalite laid.

Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hill. 22 Car. Rot. Q.
VIncent brought an Action of Trespass against Fursy for breaking open 2
Chests, and taking away certain Clothes, and 3 l. in money, Arrest of Judgment
in Trespass.
and had a Verdict for him. The Defendant moves in Arrest of Judgment, and
takes these exceptions. 1. That the Declaration is too general, for it sets not
forth what the cloths were which were taken away, and so the value of them
cannot be known as it ought to be, that Damages may be rightly given. 2. In
this one Declaration there is an Action of Trespass, joined with an Action
upon the Case, viz. the Trespass for breaking open the Chests, and the Action
of the Case for taking away the clothes, and money, which ought not to be, for
two several Actions ought not to be laid in one Declaration. Wadham Windham of
Council with the Plaintiff said it was well enough, and could not be
otherwise, and the thing is certainly enough set forth, and shall be
interpreted reddendo singula singulis, viz. the spoliavit in the Declaration
shall have reference to the clothes, and the cepit to the money. Trover and
Conversion.
Roll Justice said, that an Action of Trover, and Conversion for diverse sorts
of linen had been adjudged good. and 29 E. 3. An Action of Trespass lies for
beating of his servant, and in Cletheroes case, an Action of Trespass was held
good for rescuing a prisoner from him whom he had Arrested, Trespass.
and the Cook of Grayes Inn brought an Action of Trespass for taking away his
wife, per quod consortium amisit, and it was held to be well brought, but if
the clothes in the case at the bar had not been in the chest, the Action would
not have lain; and he took another exception, namely that Declaration wss for
the breaking of 2 chests, Incertainty.
and so it appears not where the clothes were when they were taken, whether in
one o^ in ^oth of them. The rule was to stay Judgment till they had seen the
Re^ord.

Hill. 22 Car. rot. 639.
CApell brought an Action Debt upon an Assumpsit to stand to an award, the
Defendant pleaded Nal Arbitrament, Demurrer upon an award.
the Plaintiff replies, and sets forth the Arbitrament, and the breach, the
Defendant demurs, and for cause shows that the award was not good, because it
was made but of one part, Award.
for it was, that one of the parties should do such things expressed, and that
the other party should pay for the making the Bonds of Submission, which cannot
be awarded, and so nothing is awarded for him to do, and the Arbitrators cannot
award this, because it is not within the submission. Submission.
Roll Justice held this a good exception, and said the Charge for making the
writings is not within the Submission, for the bonds were made before the
Submission, and it was held 13 Jac. that the words super praemissis in the
award will not help an award made but of one part.

Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
AN Action of Debt was brought upon a Bond, Demurrer to a Declaration in Debt
upon a bond to perform Covenants of an Indenture. Breach. Interpretations.
to perform the Covenants of an Indenture of a Demise for years. The Plaintiff
declares that he made the Lease to the Defendant the 28. day of May, and that
afterward scilicet the 27, of the same Month of May, the Defendant broke the
Covenant. To this Declaration the Defendant did demurr, because it appears that
the breach is set forth to be before the lease began, which cold not be, and so
there is no cause of Action. But to this Bacon Justice said, where the postea
and the scilicet are repugnant in a deed, as here they are, the postea shall be
good to signify the time of the Covenant broken, and the scilicet shall be
void. Therefore show cause why the Plaintiff should not have Judgment. Nota.

that the cause of Action if any were arose in the body of the County of
Lincoln, and not within the jurisdiction of the City of Lincoln. Hales on the
other side said, they had admitted the jurisdiction of the Court in that they
had not pleaded to it. But Roll Justice said, inferior Courts are limited in
their jurisdictions, and ought to be kept in order by prohibitions if they
exceed, and if they proceed in matters not within their jurisdiction their
proceedings are void. Adjourned to the next Term.

Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court was moved for a Prohibition to an inferior Court, For a prohibition

but on the contrary part it was said, that they moved too late, for they had
admitted the jurisdiction of the Court by pleading, and cited 9 H. 7.12. and
Fitz. jurisdict. 19. Bacon Justice said, it is here in a Court of Common Law,
and not in the spiritual Court or Admiralty, and therefore a Prohibition may be
here granted notwithstanding the pleading there, Prohibition.
but had it been the spiritual Court or the Admiralty, it had been otherwise.
But Roll Justice said, it was all one in the spiritual Court, or Admiralty as
it is in this case, if they exceed their jurisdiction. Jurisdiction.
Yet it is mischeivous to grant a prohibition in this case, for thereby many
Judgments will be stopped. Therefore the Court would advise to the next Term,
but stayed nothing.

granted, and so said Hodsden the Secondary, although nothing erroneous be
issuing out of this Court, and Bacon Justice said that the Writs of the Court

and therefore we will make no rule to stay their proceedings, but you shall
have a supersedeas if you will.

an Endictment upon the Statute of usury. Pursuance.
The exception taken was, that it is not said corrupt agreavit nec accepit,
and so the Statute is not pursued; Roll Justice said, that it is the corrupt
receiving, and the corrupt contract, upon which Endictments are framed upon the
old Statute, viz. 3. Jac. etc. but if the Endictment be framed upon the Statute
of 21 Jac. there it ought to be upon the corrupt contract, and because this
Endictment is framed upon the Statute of 21 Jac. and mentions not the corrupt
contract, it is not good, and therefore let it be quashed.

she can witch and unwitch! and has a Verdict. The Defendant moved in Arrest
of Judgment that the words are not actionable, because the Plaintiff is not by
the speaking of them brought within the Statute of 21. Jac. against
Witchcraft: But Roll Justice doubted, whether the word Sorcerer did not bring
the Plaintiff within the Statute. Yet Judgment was stayed till the Plaintiff
should move. Hill. the same year it was moved again, and the Court adjudged Nil

Paradine and Jane.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hill. 22 Car. rot. 1178.
PAradine brought an Action of Debt for rent due for lands, Argument in debt
for rent upon a lease for years.
let for years unto Jane the Defendant, and declares particularly how much rent
was due, and for what time. The Defendant pleads a special Plea to this effect;
as to part of the rent for which the Action is brought he confesses the
Action: As to the rest he pleads, that Prince Rupert an Alien, and an Enemy of
the King invaded the land with an Army, and with diverse armed men did enter
upon him, and did drive away his Cattle, and expelled him from the lands let
unto him by the Plaintiff, and kept him out that he could not enjoy the lands
for such a time; and demands judgment if for the rent incur during that time
the Plaintiff ought to have his Action? Demurrer.
To this Plea the Plaintiff demurrs, and for cause says, that it is neither
good in matter nor form. The 1. question was, whether a Lessee for years ousted
by an Army or Aliens, can plead it in Bar, Plea. Debt. contract. VV^st.
in an Action of Debt brought for rent due upon the Lease? And to this it was
said, that this is an Action of Debt, and lies merely upon the contract between
the parties and so this collateral matter pleaded is nothing to the purpose,
but had it been an Action of wast, if the wast had been done by Pr. Rupert, and
his Soldiers, it may be it might have been pleaded to bar the Plaintiff, and
19. E. s. Brook Covenant 4. was cited. Next the Plea does not say, that the
Armed men with Prince Rupert were Aliens or Enemies of the King, Allen. Enemy.
but only that Prince Rupert was so. But to this exception Roll Justice
answered, that they shall be so intended if they be his Army with which he
invaded the Land. Plea.
Another exception was taken, that the Plea gives no answer at all for one
Quarters rent demanded, which incurred after the time that he was kept out by
Prince Rupert. The Council for the Defendant in defense of the Plea, urged that
it was not necessary to aver, that the Army with Prince Rupert were Aliens, and
cited 3 H. 6. 61. and the Council took a difference between an Enemy and a
Rebel; Rebel.
and though in the case of a Rebellion this might not be a good Plea, yet in
case of an Invasion he conceived it was, Remedy.
because he could have no remedy against the party, and resembled this case to
cases of like nature cited out of 9 E. 3. 7. 40 E. 3 6. and 33 H. 6. 1. Waste.
and said, that where waste is done in the Lands let for years by one, again
whom the Lessee can have no remedy over, there the Lessee for years is not
chargeable for the waste, except he be bound by a particular Covenant to keep
the Lands let without waste. Also by the Law of Reason it seems the Defendant
in our case ought not to be charged with the rent, because he could not enjoy
that that was let to him, and it was no fault of his own that he could not,
Civil law. Canon. Moral. Innundation.
and the Civil-law, and Canon Law, and Moral Authors do confirm this, and Dyer
56. and 11. Ass. 13. were cited; and it was said, there is no difference
between an innundation and this invasion, and had the Lands been surrounded by
water, the Lessee should not have been chargeable for the rent during that
time, neither as I conceive shall he be here. Next consider the nature of the
reservation, 10. Rep. 1 28. Rent. Payment.
A rent is not to be paid until it may be intended that the Lessee might have
received the profit of the thing for which the rent is to be paid, 27 E. 3.81.
8 H. 4.6. Fitzh. Execution 146.9 E. 3.16. neither by the Martial law is the
Defendant chargeable, Martial Law. Law of Nature. Covenant.
and that Law is the Law of Nature as well as of Nations. But Roll Justice
answered, that the Plea was not good, for he has not pleaded that the Army
were Aliens and unknown, as he ought to have done, and the pleading that it was
hostilis exercitus, makes not the Plea more certain than before, and if the
Tenant for years covenant to pay rent, though the Lands let him be surrounded
with water, yet he is chargeable with the rent, much more here. Therefore let
the Plaintiff take his Judgment.

Fremling and Clutherbook.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
FRemling and his Wise, Arest of Judgment in Trover and Conversion.
Executrix of A. B. bring an Action of Trover and Conversion against
Clutherbook, for Goods of the Testators found, and converted by the Defendant,
and obtained a verdict against him. The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment,
and took these Exceptions. 1. That the Declaration was of a joint possession of
Goods of the Husband and Wife, and damages are given to the Husband and Wife,
whereas the Goods properly belong to the Wife only as an Executrix, and not to
the Husband and Wife. Possession.
2ly. It does not set forth how the Feme came to the possession of the Goods.
But to this Roll Justice answered. that the possession of the Wife, Damages.
as Executrix, was also the possession of her Husband, and that the damages
recovered shall be to the estate of the Testatour, and so may concern them
both. And for the second exception, this being a possessary Action only, it is
not necessary to show how the possession of the Goods was gained. Stayed till
the other should move.

Parmiter and Cressy.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
PArmiter brings an Action upon the case upon an Assumpsit, and declares, Arest
of Judgment in an Indebitatus Astumpsit.
that the Defendant in consideration that the Plaintiff had sold and delivered
unto him such a number of pieces of Stuffs, the Defenant did assume and promise
to the Plaintiff to deliver unto him the value of the Stuffs in such Pipes of
Wine, lying in Bradgates Cellar in London as the Plaintiff should make choice
of; and for not performing the same brings this Action. The Plaintiff obtains a
verdict. The Defendant moves in arrest of Judgment and shows these causes. 1.
That the Plaintiff does not aver in his Declaration, that he made any election
of the Pipes of Wine, Averment.
and before such election the Defendant was not bound to deliver them, nay it
was impossible for him to perform the agreement before the election. 2ly.
Election.
The Plaintiff does not set forth, that he made his election where the Wine
was, which he ought to have done, because of the insupportableness of the
commodity to be brought to him to make his choice. The Court held, that here
ought to be a special request made to deliver the Wines, Request special.
because it is upon a Contract, and an Action of Debt lies not for them, and
thereupon arrested the Judgment till the Plaintiff should move. The same Term
Judgment was given against the Plaintiff. Quod nil capiat per billam.

Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Plaintiff brings an Action of the Case against the Defendant, Arest of
Judgment in an action upon the Case forwords. Words. Trial. False Doctria.
for speaking these words against him being a Minister, He is an Adulterer,
Whoremaster, Drunkard, a common Swearer, and a Preacher of false Doctrine. The
Plaintiff has a Verdict. The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment that the
words were not actionable, because the matter expressed by them is merely
Ecclesiastical, and not tryable at the Common law; and it was said, that a man
may preach false Doctrine, and not be punished for it, if he be not a beneficed
man, and it does not appear here, Heresy.
that the Plaintiff had any living, and besides, it is not said he was a
Preacher of heretical Doctrine, but of false Doctrine, which words are more
ambiguous. The judgment was stayed till the Plaintiff should move.

Mack and Cubitt.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Pasc. 23 Car. rot. Q.
MAck brought an Action upon the case against Cubitt for speaking these words
of him, Arest of Judgment in an action upon the Case for words.
You are a branded Rogue, and have held up your hand at the Bar, Words.
and deserve to be hanged, and shall be hanged. The Plaintiff has a Verdict.
The Defendant moves in arrest of Judgment that the words were not actionable,
for they are all but words of Infamy and disgrace, and not of damage to the
Plaintiff. But it was said, that it had been adjudged that an Action did lie
for saying one had been endicted of Barratry, where the party that was endicted
was acquitted, and for saying one was a Banckrupt Rogue. But because Panel of
Council with the Defendant said, Presidents.
he could show Presidents that the words are not actionable, the Court forbore
to give Judgment, but desired to see them, and gave him time to bring them in
another day. Panel cited two Presidents, but no Judgment in either. Whereupon
Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

Blackwell and Ashton.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Four several persons were bound conjuctim and divisim in an Obligation to
Blackwell, Demurrer to a Scire facias upon a Judgment. Demurrer. Abatement.
Blackwell has a Judgment against them, one of the Defendants dies, Blackwell
sues out a Scire facias against the 4. and it was demurred to the Scire facias,
because one of the Defendants against whom the Judgment upon which the Scire
facias was granted, was dead when the Scire facias issued forth. In this case
it was said, if two be bound jointly in an Obligation, and an Action be brought
against one of them only, upon this Obligation the Defendant cannot demur, but
may plead in Abatement of the Writ. And if two be bound jointly in an
Obligation, and one of them dye, and the Obligee brings an Action of Debt
against the other that survives, he must in his Declaration set forth that the
other is dead. The Plaintiff in the case at the Bar, perceiving the inclination
of the Court to be that the Scire facias was not good, Scire facias.
moved for his own expedition to have it quashed, which was granted.

and declares, that the Defendant had killed diverse infected Cattle, and had
thrown out the inwards or offall of those Cattle upon the Close of the
Plaintiff, whereby diverse of the Plaintiffs Cattle were infected with the
murrain, and did dye thereof, and shows how many, and declares to his damage
so much, and has a verdict against the Defendant. The Defendant moved in
arrest of Judgment, and offers these exceptions, 1. The Declaration is, that
the Plaintiffs Cattle were infected morbo mortali, Anglice with the murrain,
whereas there is a proper Latin word to express the Murrain, Words.
namely Lues, which ought to have been used, and not to be expressed by such
uncertain words as morbus mortalis is, which signifies only a mortal disease,
and so might be any other Disease as well as that. 2ly. The Declaration says
that the Defendant did cast interioria, Anglice the inwards or off all of the
Cattle, whereas that is not the proper Latin word for them, but Intestin^. 3ly.
The Declaration does not set forth what Cattle they were, nor how many they
were, that the Defendant had killed, and thrown their inwards or offall on the
Plaintiffs Close. But the Court overruled all the exceptions, and ordered the
Defendant to show better cause why the Plaintiff should not have judgment.

Rawson and Bargue.
Trin. 23 Car. Banc. Reg. Vid. antea.
THe case between Rawson and Bargue upon the special Verdict found in an Action
upon the Statute of 2 Ed. 6. for not setting forth of Tithes, Arguments whether
a Free Chapel or not within the Statute of 2 Ed. 6. Statute. Free Chapel.
wherein the Question was whether the Chapel was a free Chapel, and given by
the Statute of ^ Ed. 6. to the King or no, was moved again and argued by
Maynard that it was a free Chapel given to Edward the 6th. by the Statute, and
said, the first reason was taken from the words of the Statute. A second reason
from the preamble of the Statute. A third from the reason of the Statute. And a
fourth from the meaning of the Statute. First the intent of the Statute was to
change Chapels of superstition to pious uses, and does intend reformation, and
not to take away the Chapels themselves, and for this cause it being for so
great a good, the Statute shall be generally interpreted, 11 Rep. f. 17. and
the words All manor in the Statute, etc. do more oppose a distinction than
the word all can do, for they are more emphatically used. 2ly Though it be
parochial and with cure of Souls, yet it is not exempted out of the Statute,
and this Statute differs from the Statute of 37 H. 8. And in case of free
Chapels, all are vested in the King (be they superstitious or not) by the
Statute. 3ly. Vesting.
It is not within the exceptions in the Statute, and therefore is within the
Statute, and he took this difference, Difference.
that Donors of Churches are, where Churches are donative; and Patrons of
Churches are, where they are presentative. 2ly. The proof of the contemporary
exposition of the Statute is here to be considered. 6 H. 7.14. Free Chapels are
of two forts, 7 Ed. 3.18.17 Ed. 3.12. Cooks Lit. 44. Division. Donative.
A Free Chapel may be presentative, and a Parish-Chucrh donative, and they are
so according to the foundation of them at the first. A Parish Church cannot be
a Free-Chapel, Parish Church.
but a Free-Chapel may be a Parish Church, 47 E. 3.5.9 E. 3. f. 10.^0 Ed. 3.
and a Church is not a Church if it have not Baptism, and Burial belonging unto
it, Derivation.
Bract. lib. ^. C. ^.17 E. 3.5 E. 3. A Chapel may be within a Church, and a
Church within a Chapel; and Capella is derived by Rhenanus the Civilian, from a
Cap or Covering, and so is to be accounted more superstitious than Churches
are, because their very name shows their derivation to be superstitious.
Twisden argued on the contrary, that it was not within the Statute of ^ Ed. 6.
nor given thereby to the King: and that it is not a Free-Chapel, neither by the
words, nor within the intent of the Statute. 2ly. If it be a Free-Chapel, yet
it is presentative, and within the jurisdiction of the Ordinary, and so not a
Free-Chapel: for it has no immunity either in regard of Jurisdiction or
otherwise, and cited Cooks Littleton, f. 94. The Chapels of the King are all
Free-Chapels, because they they are exempt from all Jurisdiction of the
Ordinary, Register, 40, 41. Three are two sorts of Chapels, to wit,
Free-donatives, 6 H. 7. f. 1^ 2ly. Presentatives. Not. Br. 35. A Chapel may be
presentative by the foundation of it, or by matter ex post facto, 22 H. 6. f.
26. Matter ex post facto. Presentation.
A second reason to prove it to be presentative may be from the finding of the
Jury who have found it so, and the calling of it otherwise is to no purpose to
alter it, Institution. Cure of souls.

then be within the intent of the Statute. 1. rep. 23. And for the word all, it
is not always taken generally. but restrictively. 2 H. 6. To the objection
made to the Verdict, that it is not found by whom it is presentative, I answer:
Special verdict.
This is a special verdict, and it is the expression of the lay gens, and shall
be interpreted according to common acceptance. The rule of Court was, to argue
it again the Next Term, because it is a cause of great consequence.

Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
BAron and Feme bring an Action of Trespass of Assault and Battery, Arrest of
Judgment in assault and battery Joining in an Action.
and declare of an assaulting, and beating of the Feme, and have a verdict; the
Defendant moves in arrest of Judgment, and for cause shows that the Baron and
Feme ought not to join in this Action, though the Assault and Battery was done
to the Feme particularly, but that the Baron ought to have brought the Action
alone, because what ever damages should be recovered would go to the Baron
only, and cited 9 E. 4. fol. 51. The Judgment was arrested till the Plaintiff
should move.

Vandicoote.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Plaintiff brings an Action of Debt against Vandicoote, Arrest of Judgment
in Debt for rent against an Executor. Debt in the detinet and debet.
the Executor of I. D. for rent due unto him by the Testator in his life time,
and has a verdict. The Defendant moves in arrest of Judgment, and for cause
shows that the Plaintiff had declared that the Defendant detinet et debet which
ought not to be, but in the detinet only, the Action being brought against him
as an Executor for rent due in the Testators life, and cited Smith and Nichols
case 7 Car. But Wild of Council with the Plaintiff said, it was good enough in
the detinet and debet, though it might have been in the Detinet only: Hales on
the contrary part said it was not good, for it could not be the Debt of the
Executor, though he be to be charged, and so he cannot be said debere, but it
is the proper debt of the Testator, and the Executor may be said detinere
because he ought to pay it, Executors. VVaiver.
and does not. Roll Justice said, that it had been adjudged good both ways,
and said, that Executors cannot waive a Term come to them, and yet they cannot
be charged in the debet and detinet. And prima facie in the case at the bar,
the Action may be brought in the debet and detinet. Yet put the cause in the
paper, and argue it again.

Tanner and Laurence.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
TAnner brings an Action upon the Case against Lawrence, Arrest of Judgment in
an indebitatus assumpfit.
upon an indebitatus Assumpsit to pay unto him two shillings a piece for every
cloth he should buy for the Defendant, and declares for so much money due unto
him, and has a verdict; the Defendant moves in arrest of Judgment, and shows
for cause, 1. That it is not averred by the Plaintiff, Averment. Notice.
that he gave any notice to the Defendant how many clothes he had bought for
him, and so it is not certain what is due to him. To this it was answered, that
the clothes were bought for the Defendant himself, and he may very well take
notice of the number of them, without any notice given him. A second answer
was, that here is a request set forth for the payment of the money, and this
implies a notice. But Roll Justice to this answer replied, Implication.
that the request does nor imply a notice, and so is I wists Case, and besides
the notice ought not to be by implication, but must be averred certainly. Yet
let it be moved again.

Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Plaintiff in an Action upon the Case upon an indebitatus declares that the
Defendant in consideration of a certain sum of money, Arrest of Judgment in an
indebitatus assumpsit.
due to the Plaintiff by the Defendant, for rent behind upon a lease for years,
did assume, and promise to pay the same unto him at a certain day, and had not
done it, and for this he brings his Action, and has a verdict, the Defendant
moved in arrest of Judgment, and for cause shows that there is no
consideration declared to ground an Action of the Case upon, for rent is a
real thing, and an Action of Debt ought to have been brought for it,
Consideration
and not this Action. Roll Justice said, that here is only a consideration in
law set forth, which is not good to warrant this Action: Debt.
But it may be there was some new consideration that sprung from the being of
the rent behind that did ground this Action, but no such thing does appear in
the Declaration. Therefore the Plaintiff nil capiat per billam, if cause be not
shown within 14 days why he should have his Judgment.

Wood and Salter.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
IN an arrest of Judgment in an Action of Trespass for carrying away 24 load

The exception was, that the Timber is not said to be the Timber ipsius
querentis, and so no cause of Action. Upon this Judgment was arrested.

Burnet and Bird.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
BUrnet the Administrator of I. S. brings an Action upon the Case against Bird,
Arrest of Judgment in an Action upon the Case upon a promise.
and declares against him upon an Assumpsit made by the Defendant to the
intestate, for the payment of a certain sum of money for a marriage portion, at 2
several days of payment equally, and that for not performing the same in the
life time of the intestate, he brings this Action. The Plaintiff has a
Verdict: The Defendant moves in arrest of Judgment, and shows for cause, that
the Plaintiff does not well set forth the granting of the letters of
Administration to him, for he says, they were granted unto him by the
Archdeacon of such a place, and does not say loci illius ordinarium nor cui
administratio-pertinuit. 2ly. It is said, that the money was to be paid at 2
several payments, which amounts to two several promises, viz. a promise to pay
the first ten pound on such a day, and a promise to pay the other sum at
another day to come, and does not allege any particular request made by the
intestate for the first ten pound. But Bacon Justice overruled both the
exceptions, and said to the first; Notice. Ordinary. Letters of ad
ministration-Peculiar.
That the law does take notice of an Archdeacon being a public Ordinary, and
therefore it is not needful to express, that the letters were granted per
Archidiaconum of such a place, Ordinarium illius loci or cui administratio
pertinuit, but otherwise it were if they were granted within a peculiar
jurisdiction. Therefore he ordered to show better matter or elce Judgment
should be given for the Plaintiff.

Eeles and Lambert.
Mich. 23 Car. Benc. Reg. vid. antea.
THe Case between Eeles and Lambert was again moved, Argument up, on a special
verdict.
which upon a special verdict found was this; Sir Molton Lambert makes a lease
of certain lands to Eeles for 21 years by deed, and Covenants for himself, his
Executors, Administrators, and Assigns, that the lessee shall peaceably, and
quietly enjoy the lands let, during all the Term, the Lessor makes his Will,
and thereby makes Lambert the Defendant his Executor, and dies, and by the Will
diverse goods in specie are devised to sundry persons, Lambert the Executor
delivers the goods bequeathed to the Legatees, Eeles is ousted of the lands by
I. S. and thereupon brings an Action of Covenant against Lambert the Executor,
who pleads fully administered. The question was, whether the paying of these
legacies by the Executor were a devastavit, Devastavit.
and so the Executor to be charged de bonis propriis to satisfy the Covenant
broken or no, Green of Council with the Plaintiff, argues that it was a
devastavit notwithstanding that the devise was of goods in specie, and that the
Executor had only delivered them, because that the Legatees had no property in
the goods bequeathed them, Property.
before the Executor had delivered them, no more than if they had never been
devised, and cited 2 H. 6. f. 16. and Cooks Lit. 111. and he said the finding
of the Covenant broken was nothing to the purpose, and he said, it was a
Devastavit, because it shall be intended, that the Executor might know of the
Covenant made by the Testator, which he was bound also to keep, or else to
satisfy for the breach of it, Covenant.
and the contingency whether the Covenant would be broken or no makes no
difference in the Case, for if it should it would prove mischievous in
destruction of Covenants, which are to be accounted of as Debts, Doct. and
Stud. lib. 2. C. 10. Dyer f. 324. Hob. ^. 363, 397. But it may be objected,
that if this should be a Devastavit then Legacies could not be paid, which
would be dangerous to Executors, by reason of being liable to suits for them,
Executors.
21 E. 4 f. 21. Brook Tit. Process, S. 10. To t^is I answer; It may be
dangerous, yet it is not to the purpose, for an Executor should consider of
such dangers, when he takes upon him an Executorship, and take notice of them,
and he is not compellable to pay Legacies, and the Law will not protect him, if
he pay them against Law, Hob. 246. and if the Court Christian endeavor to
compel him he may have a Prohibition. Prohibition.
3ly. The Executor peradventure might conceive that there would be Assets
afterward, and in that consideration did pay the Legacies, and if the 5 Rep.
Green and Harisons case, and 15 Iac. Robsons case be objected, I answer, this
Case differs from them: for here the Question is between Legacies and Debts,
and there between one Debt and another, to wit, between a Debt of a higher
nature, and a Debt of a lower nature. Hales for the Defendant argued, that it
was no Devastavit. 1. He agrees, Property.
that the Legatees have no property in the Goods, by the devise. 2ly. If the
Covenant had been broken when the Legacies were paid, it would have been a
Devastavit. 3ly. He held, that the matter is as well found in the special
verdict, as it might have been pleaded, and not put at all to the Jury to find.
The Question here is, whether the administration of the Goods, before the
Covenant broken, be good after it is broken, and there is good matter before
the Court found in the special verdict, though it might have been found better.
The first Argument I will draw from the nature of that, upon which the Action
is founded, namely, the Covenant. The Action depends partly upon the Deed of
Covenant partly upon the breach of it, and here is no ground of Action at the
time when the administration of the Goods was made; and Harisons case cannot be
avoided: for a Statute is a present duty, Duty. Star. Obligation.
and ought to be paid before an Obligation. Robsons case 14. and 15 Iac. And it
is as agreeable to Law, to pay a Legacy as a Debt upon a Covenant; and the
mischief to the Lessee in our case is not so material, as the mischief may be
on the Executors part, and it is not materially objected, that he might take
security, Security.
for he cannot compel it. For the Objection that our Law takes notice of a
Legacy, I answer, that the Law takes notice of a Legacy, as to give an interest
in it to the Legatee, Interest.
although he may not take it without the Executors consent. 2ly. It takes
notice of it as remediable by the Law of the Kingdom, though not by the
Common Law: and therefore consider the Statute 21 H. 8. of Administrations;
Common law, Civil law.
and the Common Law is Judge of the Statute, concerning Administration, and not
the Spiritual-law, Hill. 17 Iac. Hinson and Buttons Case. The Common Law gives
not a remedy fora Legacy, Legacy.
but the Spiritual-Court is supported by the Common Law to do it: and by the
ancient Common Law there was remedy to recover a Legacy, 2 Rich. 3. f. 14.
Glanv. lib 7. C. 6.7. and the power of the Ecclesiastical Court is derived from
the Common Law, and the Common Law will take notice of a compulsary way in the
Ecclesiastical-Court to pay a Legacy. And the payment in our case is executed,
and now the Law takes notice of it, because the Defendant was compellable to
it. P^omise.
If an Executor promise to pay a Legacy, an Action upon the case will lie
against him, if he do not pay it. Roll Justice, the Testator may defeat all
Covenants by this means; and Greens reason is not answered, which is the great
doubt in the case. It was Necton and Sharps case, 38 Eliz. that Legacies ought
to be paid conditionally, viz. to be restored, if the Covenant should be
broken. When you argue again, argue to this point. Bacon Justice cited a Case,
32 Eliz. in the Exchequer, against the opinion of Roll, and said, if the
Legacies should not be paid, it might be a loss to the Commonwealth: for it
may be the Goods will perish with keeping them, and the keeping of them may be
a charge to the Executor, and no body shall have any benefit of them, for they
may cost more to keep, than they are worth, and a Devastavit lies not against
an Executor of an Executor, Devastavit.
for the Devastavit of the first Executor. Roll Justice, the Ecclesiastical-law
ought to make a provision against these mischiefs, Prohibition.
otherwise a Prohibition lies against them. Appointed to be argued a gain

Watson and Watson.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hiill. 22 Car. rot. 1687.
Watson brought an Action of Debt upon an Obligation against Watson, Arest of
Judgment in Debt upon an Obligation to stand to an award. Award.
the Condition was, to stand to the Award of two Arbitrators, or of the Vmpire.
The Defendant pleads nullum Arbitrium. The Plaintiff replies, that the Vmpire
made the Award. The Defendant demurs, and shows for cause, that the Award was
not good: for it was uncertain, and not final on both parts, for one party was
awarded to pay so much money to the other, as in conscience should be due, and
no man can say, what that is. The Court said, the Award was insensible. And
Bacon Justice said, it was a Vicars Award. Puliston of Council with the
Plaintiff cited these Books to prove the Award good, 8 Ed. 4. f. 2.20 Ed. 4. f.
1. 4.18 Ed. 4. f. 2. Pasc. 4 Iac. Gosnolls case, and 9 H. 7. and said, these
cases proved, that where an incertainty in an Award may be made certain, there
the Award is good, and so it is in our Case. 2ly. He said, that the Award here
is good, notwithstanding it be to pay so much money as shall be due in
Conscience: Conscience.
for it shall be meant as is due in Law: for Law and Conscience are one and the
same. But Roll Justice said, that the Award does not make a final
determination of the matters in controversy between the parties, and so it is
no Award. And Bacon Justice cited 5 Rep. That an Arbitriment ought to be
certain, and final, and this Award wants both these properties; and therefore
is not good.

Fitchet against Wolston.
Mich. 23 Car.
FItchet had a Judgment against I. S. in an action of Debt, Demurrer to a Plea
upon a Scire facias, against an Administrator. Scire facias with a Fieri facias.
I. S. dies intestate, Wolston takes out Letters of Administration of the Goods
and Chattels of I. S. Fitchet takes out a Scire facias, with a Fieri facias to
enquire what Goods of I. S. are in the hands of the Administrator, and to take
them in execution upon the Judgment Wolston, the Defendant, appears to the
Scire facias, and pleads, fully administered. The Plaintiff demurs to this Plea,
and shows for cause, that in this Case he should have pleaded non Devastavit,
and not fully administered. 2ly. The plea answers not the Writ. The Court
answered, all such processes are only to make the Executors, or Administrators
to answer, Fully administered.
and therefore fully administered is a good Plea, for it is a good answer, and
it would be dangerous to plead other ways, And Roll Justice said, that this
being a Scire facias with a: Fieri facias, according to the new manner of
making the Writ, it would be dangerous to plead non Devastavit, and it has
been adjudged a good plea, Non Devastavit.
to say fully administered in a Scire facias against an Executor, but it is
better to plead nulla bona devenerunt ad manus, Nulla bona.
with which he could satisfy the Debt since the Scire facias brought. But this
being a new case it is fit to be argued. Therefore let us have Books.

Finer and Jeffry.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
FIner brings an Action upon the Case against Jeffry, and declares, Arrest of
Judgment in an Assumpsit.
that the Defendant did assume and promise unto him, that if he would forbear
to sue one who had assaulted him and beaten him, that he the Defendant would
pay the Plaintiff as much money as he was damnified by the Assault and Battery;
The Plaintiff has a verdict. The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, and
showed for cause, Consideration.
1. That it does not appear by the Declaration, that the Plaintiff had any
intention to sue the party for the Assault and Battery, and so the Assumpsit in
consideration, that he would forbear to sue for it is no consideration. 2ly. He
does not set forth, that he gave any notice to the Defendant, Notice.
what dammage^ he had sustained by the Battery. But the Court held, that the
Plaintiff needed not to allege, that he had an intent to sue the party, for
that the Defendant took notice of, when the Assumpsit was made: and for the
notice what damages the Plaintiff had sustained, the request to perform the
Assumpsit implies that sufficiently, and so gave judgment for the Plaintiff.

Dersly and Dersly.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THree are endicted of Conspiracy and forgerg, Arrest of Judgment upon an
Endictment of Forgery.
and one of them only is found guilty by the Jury. The party found guilty moved
in arrest of judgment, and offered these Exceptions. 1. The endictment is for
a joint forgery, and so one only cannot be guilty: but if one be acquitted, all
must be acquitted. 2ly. The endictment is for forgery, and causing to forge,
which are two several and different Acts. But to these the Court said nothing;
But took another Exception, namely, Conspiracy.
that the Conspiracy is not found upon which the Endictment is grounded,
according to the Statute, for 2 are acquitted, and so there cannot be a
Conspiracy in the third person, nor in any of them, for one cannot conspire
alone.

Bruer and Sowthwell.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
IN this case it was moved again in arrest of Judgment, Arrest of Judgment in
an Action upon an Assumpsit. Nudum pactum. Consideration.
upon the exception formerly taken, namely, that the words in the Declaration
discounting for four Months were uncertain, and so there is no consideration
for the Assumpsit, and then it is but nudum pactum. Roll Justice said, the
Declaration is insufficient for the incertainty: for it cannot be known what is
meant by the word discounting. Yet he said, that though part of the
Consideration, upon which the Assumpsit is grounded, be against Law; yet if the
other part be good, and it may be divided, the Assumpsit is good
notwithstanding. Yet we will hear Council on both parts, before the Plaintiff
shall have Judgment.

COlson brought an Action upon the Case upon an Assumpsit against Bedlore,
Arrest of Judgment in an action upon the Case upon an Assumsit.
and declares, that in consideration of so much monys, paid by the Plaintiff to
the Defendant, the Defendant did assume and promise to deliver so many loads of
Hay unto him at such a place, and for not performing his promise he brings his
Action. The Plaintiff has a Verdict; The Defendant moved in arrest of
Judgment upon these Exceptions. 1. The Declaration does not set forth,
Jurisdiction.
that the place where the promise was made was within the Jurisdiction of the
Court, which ought to have been, because it is the ground of the Action. To
this Roll Justice answered, that it does not appear, that it is out of the
Jurisdiction of the Court, and it shall not be intended to be so, if it be not
alleged by the other party. A second exception was, Intendment. Request.
that there is not a special Request set forth for the Defendant to carry and
lay the Hay in the place alleged. 3ly. The pleading is out of Court, for want
of a continuance to the Court, for the continuance is not to the Court,
Discontinuance. Verdict.
but to such a day only. 4ly. The Verdict is informal, and shows no cause why
damages are given. Roll Justice to the first exception said, that the party
ought to have taken advantage in pleading, that the cause of Action was out of
the Jurisdiction of the Court, Pleading.
and not to move such matter in arrest of Judgment, for it is improper. But
the Court ruled the Plaintiff to show cause why Judgment should not be
arrested upon the third exception. Afterward the same Term judgment was given
nil capiat per billam against the Plaintiff for the discontinuance in the
Process.

Tentch and Cletheroe.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Pasc. 22 Car. rot. 332.
TEntch brings an Action of Covenant against Cletheroe, Error to reverse a
Judgment in an Action of Covenant.
and declares, that the Defendant had covenanted with him to pay such a sum of
money into the Exchequer at such a time, and for not performing this Covenant he
brings his Action. The Plaintiff has a Verdict, and a Judgment. The Defendant
brings his Writ of Error, and assigns for error, that the Plaintiff had not set
forth in what County the Exchequer is, and cites Hobs his case, Pasc. 8 Car.
County.
and a case 22 Car. C. Banc. That the County is material to be alleged, by
reason of the Venue, 1 E. 4.3. Cooks institut. 210.21 H. 6. f. 4. The Court
held that the County where the Exchequer was ought to be alleged, Exchequer.
because the Exchequer is transitory, and not fixed to one place, Venue.
and so there can be no Venue, because it appears not in what County it is. And
for this cause the Judgment was reversed.

Sawyer and Russell.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
SAwyer brought an Action upon the Case for speaking these words of him, Thou
art a Witch, and have bewitched my Cow. Arrest of Judgment in an Action upon
the Case for words. VVitch-craft.
The Plaintiff has a Verdict. The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment for
these reasons. 1. Such bewitching as is mentioned in the Declaration is not
punishable by the Statute of 1 lac. for it comes not within any of the branches
of that Statute, neither that which speaks of death by Witchcraft, nor of the
other branch: for it is not averred, that the Cow was hurt or destroyed by the
bewitching, and so the party is not punishable. Intendment.
And it shall not be intended to be so, for the party shall not be punished by
an Endictment by an intention, neither shall he be here in this Case. And 2ly.
words ambiguous of this nature, shall be taken in mitiori sensu. Roll Justice
said, that these words, Words.
Thou have bewitched my Mothers Milk and Drink have been adjudged actionable,
and here is a scandal of the party of whom the words are spoken; and the words
thou have bewitched, implies hurt done to the thing bewitched; and this case
differs from an Endictment: for an Endictment must be more certain, than these
words need to be. And a violent intendment as here is, may bring one within the
compass of an Action. Therefore let the Plaintiff have his Judgment, if better
matter be not shown Monday next.

Nevill and Mott.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
NEvill brought an Action upon the Case against Mott, and declared, Arest of
Judgment in an action upon the Case for words.
that the Defendant being in company with him with a Constable, did speak thus
of the Plaintiff to the Constable, There he is, take him, for I charge him with
flat felony, and after spoke these words of him also, Mr. Nevill has taken my
Sheep with a felonious intent. The Plaintiff has a verdict; The Defendant
moved in arrest of Judgment, that the words are not actionable, and cited
Poland and Masons case, Hob. Rep. and alleged these reasons also. 1. Because
the words were spoken to a Constable in prosecution of Justice, which shall not
be taken hold of by a private person as a particular injury meant to him.
Averment.
2ly. It is not said the words were spoken falso and malitiose, as it ought to
have been. But to the second Exception, Roll Justice said, It is not not
necessary to say, they were spoken falso and malitiose, where they appear to be
scandalous, for there the Action lies well, though it be not so expressed, and
if one charge another with suspicion of Felony, and speak such words of him, if
they appear to be maliciously spoken, an Action very well lies. The rule was
for the Plaintiff to take his Judgment, if better cause be not showed to the
contrary.

King and Hide.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
HIde moved for the quashing of an Endictment taken before Commissioners of
Sewers, For quashing an Edictment before Commissioners of Sewers.
wherein he was endicted for a nuisance made in the high way by reason of
penning of water in the River, at his Mill, whereby the water overflowing the
Banks did annoy the way and he took this exception to the Endictment, that it
did not say it was a navigable River. But to this Roll Justice answered, it was
not necessary to say it was navigable: for if it be a common passage for water
it is sufficient, and lies within the conusance of the Commissioners. But Roll
took another exception to the Endictment; That it sets forth this overflowing
of the water to be a nuisance to the high way, Nuisance.
and for this the party is endicted, whereas Commissioniers of Sewers have no
power to meddle with such nusances in the way, but only with passages by Water.
And for this cause the Endictment was quashed.

Monger and Shaterton.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. 23 Car. rot. 569.
A Writ of Error was brought in this Court to reverse a Judgment given in the
Barrow-Court of Southwark, Error to reverse a Judgment given in the
Burrow-Court of Southwark.
and the Error assigned was, that in the Venire facias one of the Jury is
called Richardon, and in the Habeas Corpora he is called Richardson, which are
two several names, and so it is uncertain what the proper name is. To this the
Council on the other side said, that this fault is helped by the Statute, it
being after a Verdict. But Bacon Justice said, Verdict.
he doubted whether it could be helped now in this Court, though it might have
been helped in the inferior Court, where the Action was brought by examination
of it, and therefore ruled to show cause why Judgment shall not be reversed on
Friday next. It was this Term reversed at the Defendants motion for his own
expedition.

Brook and Brook.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. 23 Car. rot. 580.
Brook brings an Action of Debt upon an Obligation against Brook, the
condition was, Demurrer to a plea in debt upon an Obligation.
that the Obligor should make an Estate of inheritance to the Obligee in such
lands at such a day, and place, and for not doing it, he brings his Action. The
Defendant pleads that he was ready at the day, and place, to make the Plainiff
an estate of inheritance in the lands; The Plaintiff demurs to the plea, Notice.
and for cause shows that the Defendant does not show that he gave notice to
the Plaintiff of his being there. To this Roll Justice said, it is not
necessary to give notice of the day or place. A second exception was that he
had not showed that he gave the Plaintiff notice what estate of inheritance he
would make him. To this Roll Justice said, he ought to have shown, Time. Place.
that he gave notice what estate he would make him, and therefore let the
Defendant show cause why the Plaintiff should not have Judgment.

Kale and Iocelyne.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.

KAle brings an Action of Debt against Iocelyne an Executor, Demurrer to a plea

Covenant.
and declares for rent grown due since the death of the Testator, by virtue of
a lease for years made of certain lands by the Plaintiff unto the Testator
which yet continues, and declares, that the Executor debet and detinet, etc.
The Defendant pleads fully administered, the Plaintiff demurs upon the plea; For
pleading in the debet and the detinet: Bacon Justice said, it was good, and so
had been adjudged. To which Roll Justice answered it had been adjudged pro and
con, to be good and to be bad, and he said, that an Executor cannot waive a
Term let to the Testator, for he is bound by Covenant to hold it, and said that
the Declaration was good in the debet and detinet prima facie; for it shall be
intended that the land let to the Testator is worth as much by the year, as the
rent that is paid for it, till the contrary be shown, and then it is reason
that the Executor be charged; Bacon Justice said, that the Executor may waive
the possession, if he find that the rent is more than the land is worth,
otherwise it may be mischievous to him. Roll. Justice said, that the
Declaration must be in the detinet and debet, otherwise it will be mischievous
to the Plaintiff, and said, that a specialty shall be satisfied before a rent
reserved upon a lease by deed, Allets.
which Bacon denied, and it was said, that a lease for years shall be assets in
the hands of an Executor, although the rent reserved be the full value of the
Lands let by the lease. The Defendant was ordered to show cause why Judgment
should not be given against him.

Baker against Edmonds.
Mich. 23 Car. B. Reg.
Hill. 22 Car. rot. 222.
BAker brings an Action upon the Case against Edmonds, Special verdict in an
Action upon the Case whether a verdict maintains the issue joined.
and declares, that whereas I. S. was indebted unto the Plaintiff in a certain
sum of money, and afterward being so indebted became a Banckrupt, and that a
Commission upon the Statute of Bankrupt was taken out by him, and other
creditors against him, and that it was found that the Defendant was indebted to
the Banckrupt, the Commissioners of the said Commission did assign over the
Debt of the Defendant mentioned in a certain schedule, amounting to such a sum,
unto the Plaintiff, in part of satisfaction of the Debt owing unto him by the
Banckrupt, by virtue whereof he demands the said Debt of the Defendant, who did
assume, and promise to pay the same, and for not performing his promise, he
brings his Action, the Defendant pleads non Assumpsit, and thereupon an issue
was joined, and a special verdict was found to the effect, as the Plaintiff
had declared, but they further find that the Debts mentioned in the schedule,
and assigned over to the Plaintiff amounted to such a sum, whereas they find
that the Defendant did not owe unto the Banckrupt so much as that Debt assigned
is, but a less sum. And upon this verdict the question was, Verdict. Issue.
Assignment.
whether the verdict did maintain the issue, which was non Assumpsit, if it
did, then they find for the Defendant, if not, then for the Plaintiff. In the
breaking of the Case it was moved whether the Assignment were good or no, in
regard that the Commissioners had mistaken the Debt, for the Debt assigned by
them was greater than the Debt found by the Jury, and so might be another Debt.
But to this Roll Justice said, that the assignment was not judicially before
them in question, for if it were, it would be judged an ill assignment, but
here it comes not in issue but only whether the Defendant did assume, and
promise or no, and the special verdict concludes not upon the assignment, but
whether the special matter found do maintain the issue or no, and therefore he
was of opinion that the Plaintiff ought to have his Judgment. Bacon Justice
differed in opinion, and said, that it is dangerous for Commissioners of
Bankrupt, to assign Debts particularly. Commissioners.
The rule then was to argue it the next Term: At which time Ward of Council for
the Defendant argued, that the verdict was for the Defendant for this reason,
viz. Because the Debt laid in the Declaration, and the Debt found by the
verdict are not the same, and so the Defendant did not assume, and promise that
which is laid in the Declaration, for there is no such Debt found, and if he
should be charged with that, he might be doubly charged, Averment.
for he may be again charged for the debt found by the verdict, and
circumstances of quantity, time and place are averred in a Declaration to make
things certain, and if they fall the Declaration is not good, 18 E. 3. fol. 25.
1. rep. 74. Palmers Case. 2ly. The Declaration is insufficient, for it
expresses not what the sum is, but says, a sum mentioned in a schedule of
Debts, which is uncertain: Roll Justice interrupted Ward. and said, all that
you have argued is out of doors, but the last matter touching the Declaration,
and to that Hales of Council with the Plaintiff said, the Declaration is good,
and certain enough, for there appears no other sum in the schedule than is
mentioned in the Declaration. Bacon Justice, The assignment is of the debt of
this man due to the Bankrupt, be it more or be it less, and has no reference
to the account, and reckoning between them, and so the Assignment is good,
though it agree not in the sum with what is justly due, and the issue is upon
the Assumpsit, Issue. Admittance.
and not upon the Assignment, for the Assignment is admitted by the Defendant,
and so not material whether it be an Assignment of the true sum or not.
Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

Bruer and Sowthwell.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Plaintiff in this Case moved again for judgment, Arrest of Judgment in
an Action upon the case upon an Assumpsit.
notwithstanding what had been formerly spoken to arrest it, for though the
word discomputando in the Declaration be insensible, yet there is enough in the
declaration to ground the Action, and that is the breach of the Assumpsit
assigned to deliver the Currants bought of the Defendant, and the word
discounting shall not hurt it. Bacon Justice was of the same opinion. But Roll
Justice said, Assumpsit. Contract.
all the bargain is here set forth upon which the Assumpsit was made, and if
the bargain be ill, the Assumpsit is not good. Hales of Council with the
Plaintiff said, if part of the bargain be insensible, and part not yet a good
Assumpsit may be grounded upon that part which is good, But Roll said the
bargain here is entire, and if part of it be not good it is all naught: yet he
said if part of a bargain be good, and part void, yet an Action may be brought
upon it. The rule was, That it should be argued again on both parts.

Seaman against Edwards.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. 23 Car. rot. 920.
SEaman brings an Action against Edwards, Demurrer to a plea pleaded by an
Executor. Plea. Executor.
and declares against him as Executor of I. S. (whereas the truth was, that I.
S. made 3 others Executors, and not the Defendant.) The Defendant pleads that
he is not the same person named in the Will. To this plea the Plaintiff demurs,
and for cause shows that he may be an Executor de son tort demesne, though he
be not named in the Will, and so may be chargeable, and therefore he ought to
have pleaded ne unques Administered come Executor, and of this opinion was the
Court, and ordered the Defendant to show cause why Judgment should not be
given against him. Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

Dod against Eaton.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
DOd brings an Action upon the Case against Eaton for speaking these words of
him, thou have the French Pox, Exception to a special verdict.
the Defendant pleads not guilty, the Jury upon this Issue find a special
verdict, viz. That the Defendant had said, thou have had the French Pox,
whereupon the Defendants Council said, that the Verdict does not maintain the
words laid in the Declaration, and that the words that are found in the verdict
are not actionable, and so the Plaintiff can have no Judgment, and cited 15
Jac. Nutcombes Case, Verdict.
and the words found are not issuable, and so the verdict is imperfect, 40 Ass.
41. Kelway. 6. 18 Ed. 3. fol. 19. Pasc. 33 Eliz: Banc. Reg. Dame Ratcliffs
Case. Dyer Sr, John Burges Case prove that the verdict is too short. Roll
Justice said, if the verdict be imperfect, there may be a new venire facias,
Venire de novo.
and so it is against the Plaintiff, for he cannot have Judgment. Panell of
Council with the Plaintiff cited Osborn, and Brooks Case that the verdict was
for the Plaintiff. But Roll Justice said, that the Jury cannot find a thing
that is not within the Declaration to maintain the Declaration, for they ought
to hold themselves to the issue, and that they have not here done, and
therefore the verdict is imperfect, and there must be a new venire facias to
try the issue again, for Judgment cannot be given upon this verdict, for they
do not find that he spoke not the words in the Declaration which are the most
material, so that the matter is not found fully enough for us to proceed to
Judgment one way or other. Adjourned.

Poole against Coply.
Mich. 23. Ca. Banc. Reg.
POole brings an Action of Trespass against Coply, Arrest of Judgment in
Trespass.
and has a verdict against the Defendant. It was moved in arrest of Judgment
that the Declaration is uncertain, for the Plaintiff declares that the
Defendant cepit et asportavit december coria, anglice hides, and the word Coria is
uncertain, for it may be coria equorum, or coria ovium, or of any other Cattle.
To this Roll Justice said, Anglice.
that it is well enough, for the Anglice had made the word certain, and it is
the usual manner to plead it thus. The Court ordered the Plaintiff should have
his Judgment, if better matter were not shown to the contrary.

Hull against Gurnet.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
HUll brings an Action of false imprisonment against Gurnet, Demurrer upon a
special plea in false imprisonment.
the Defendant pleads a special justification, that he took, and imprisoned
the Plaintiff by virtue of a Commission granted out of the Court of the
Admiralty, to examine the taking away of certain goods which were wracked by
the Sea. Custom.
To this plea the Plaintiff demurred, and showed for cause; That the Defendant
has not set forth the Custom of the Admiral Court, that the first process
thereof is a Capias, and so it appears not, whether he have proceeded right or
no. Admiralty.
2ly. It does not appear that the matter for which the Commission was granted
is Maritime, and other matter they ought not to meddle withal. The Rule of
Court was to show cause why Judgment should not be given against the Defendant
upon this plea.

Smith against Stone.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
SMith brought an Action of Trespass against Stone pedibus ambulando, Special
justification in trespass pedibus ambulando. Trespass.
the Defendant pleads this special plea in justification, viz. That he was
carried upon the land of the Plaintiff by force, and violence of others, and
was not there voluntarily, which is the same trepasse, for which the Plaintiff
brings his Action. The Plaintiff demurs to this plea: In this case Roll Justice
said, that it is the Trespass of the party that carried the Defendant upon the
land, and not the Trespass of the Defendant: as he that drives my Cattle into
another man's land is the Trespassor against him, and not I who am owner of the
Cattle.

Matthew against Herle.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. 23 Car. rot. 1554.
Matthew brought an Action of trespass against Herle for breaking his Fence,
and entering into his Close, etc. Demurrer to a plea in trespass quare clausum
fregit
The Defendant pleads that I. S. was seized of this land, wherein the Trespass
is supposed to be done, in fee, and so seized did demise the same for years by
deed to the Plaintiff reserving rent, in which deed was a clause of reentry for
non payment of the rent, and afterward made his last Will in writing, and
dyed; by which will be gave the said land in qua, etc. to the Defendant, and
that after the rent was behind, and that he for the non payment of the rent
according to the Covenant in the deed, by virtue of the clause of reentry did
enter intot he lands, which is the same breaking of the Fence, and entry for
which the Plaintiff brings his Action, and demands Judgment if the Plaintiff
ought to have his Action. To this Plea the Plaintiff demurs, and shows for
cause: That it does not show that the lease made to the Plaintiff is a lease of
the land, in which the Trespass is supposed to be done, 2ly. License.
The Defendant does not show that he did ^nter into the land by leave of the
Executor, which he ought to have done; for though the land was devised to him
by will, yet he cannot enter into the land without leave of the Executor. The
Court ordered the Defendant to show cause why Judgment should not be given
against him upon his plea.

and Long.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Plaintiff brought an Action upon the Case for these words spoken of him,
Arest of Judgment in an action for words.
Long is a murderer, and has bewitched my Child, and was the death of my
Child, and obteins a verdict. The Defendant moves in arrest of Judgment, and
takes these exceptions to the Declaration. 1. That it is not said, that the
Child was bewitched to death. 2ly. It does not express whether the Child
bewitched was born alive or not. To this the Court said, Felony.
that the bewitching of the Child is Felony, though it do not dye by it. And to
the second exception, That the Court does not take notice of a Child if it be
dead-born, and they will intend it was born alive; and Roll Justice said, that
these words Thou did kill my Masters Cook, Averment.
have been adjudged actionable, although the Plaintiff did not aver, that his
Master had a Cook. Therefore let the Plaintiff take his Judgment, if better
matter be not shown Saturday next.

Carver against Pierce.
23 Car. Banc. Reg.
CArver brings an Action upon the Case against Pierce for speaking these words
of him, Arrest of Judgment in an action for Words
Thou art a Thief, for thou have stolen my Dung, and has a Verdict. The
Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, that the words were not actioanble: for
it is not certain whether the Dung be a Chattel, or part of the Freehold, and
if so, it cannot be Theft to take it, but a Tresspass, and then the Action will
not lie. Chattel.
Bacon Justice, Dung is a Chattel, and may be stolen. But Roll Justice
answered, Dung may be a Chattel, and it may not be a Chattel; for a heap of
Dung is a Chattel, but if it be spread upon the Land it is not, and said, the
word Thief here is actionable alone, Felony.
and there are no subsequent words to mitigate the former words: for the
stealing of Dung is Felony if it be a Chattel. Bacon Justice said, It does not
appear in this Case of what value the Dung was, and how shall it then be known,
whether it be Felony or pety Larceny? To this Roll answered, the words are
scandalous notwithstanding and actionable, though the stealing of the Dung be
not Felony. The rule was, to move it again Tuesday next.

Mich. 23. Car. Banc. Reg.
A Writ of Error was brought in this Court to reverse a Judgment given in the
Marshals Court, Error to reverse a Judgment, for discontinuance in the Process.
Discontinuance.
and the exception taken was, that there was a dicontinuance in the process,
and so there ought to have been no Judgment, and therefore the Judgment given
is erroneous; and that there was a Discontinuance it thus appears. The
Continuance was ad proximam Curiam, and it appears upon the retorn of the
Venire facias, that that was no Court day, for it was the three and twentyeth
day of the Month, whereas Friday, on which day the Court was held, was not the
23 day, and so there is Error in the continuance. Roll Justice said, the former
Continuance was to the 9th. day, and from thence to the 15th. and that is but
six days, and so wants of the time. Judgment.
Bacon Justice, Where there is a Discontinuance the Court has no power to give
Judgment, and so the Judgment is here erroneous, and therefore let it be
reversed, nisi causa, etc.

Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
LEssee for years of Lands by Deed, Demurrer to a Plea in an action of Covenant.
brings an Action of Covenant against the Lessor, and declares, that the Lessor
had covenanted, that he should peaceably and quietly enjoy the Lands let during
the Term, and that a Stranger entered upon him, and ousted him within the Term.
To this Declaration the Defedant demurs. Roll Justice said, that the Covenant
in this Case is broken, though it be a Stranger that entered and ousted the
Lessee. Walker of Council with the Defendant took this difference, where a
Stranger enters upon the Lessee and does a Trespass, and where he enters and
outs the Lessee; in the former Case he said, Covenant.
the Covenant is not broken: but in latter it is broken. Judgment was given
for the Plaintiff except cause should be shown Monday next.

Thynn against Thynn.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hill. 23 Car. rot. 1658.
THynn brought an Action of Dower against Thynn, Error to reverse a Judgment
in Dower. Return. Proclamation.
and has a Judgment by default, and thereupon a Writ of Enquiry issued out to
the Sheriff, who delivered seisin of the Dower recovered, and returned the
Writ; upon this Judgment, The Defendant brings a Writ of Error, and assigns
these Errors in the Record. 1. The original Writ appears not to be returned
according to the Statute; for the year does not appear when it was returned.
2ly. The Proclamation made by the Sheriff appears not to be where the Land
lies. 3ly. Summons.
The return does not mention that the Proclamation was after the Summons, as it
ought to be, as it is Hob. Reports, in Allens Case. 4ly. It is not said that he
did make Proclamation upon the Land. 5ly. It appears not that the Proclamation
was in the Parish where the Summons was, as the Statute directs. To these
exceptions Hales of Council on the other side, answered. To the first, Return.
that the retorn of the original Writ shall be intended to be in the year of
the Reign, and not of the Age of the King, though the word Reign be omitted. To
the second, the Lands lie in diverse Parishes, and Proclamation at the Church of
any of the Parishes is good enough. 2ly. It does not appear, that there are
diverse Churches in New-Sarum where the Proclamation was made. To the third
exception, the Proclamation is said to he made prout breve postula^, and that
shall be supposed duly done, and implies all requisite circumstances, and he
cannot make another return, and it is impossible to be otherways. To the
fourth, it is not necessary to retorn the place of the Summons, and it is said
that it was made secundum formam Statuti, which supplies the rest. And to this
the Court said, that the words secundum formam Statuti extend far. And Roll
Justice said, that Proclamaiton in one place was good in all. Holhead of
Council with the Plaintiff, in the Writ of Error proceeded, and took these
exceptions in the demand of the Dower. 1. The demand is generally de rectoria,
which is not good, Demand; Rector.
for the incertainty of it: for there may be a Rector of a College, of a
Province, and of a Bishopric, as well as of a Parish Church, and therefore it
ought to have been de Rectoria Ecclesiae parochialis de etc. 12 H. 4. f. ^9.
pl. 1. 2ly. The demand decimarum is too general, and not good, and it ought to
have been decimarum granorum, soeni, etc. for the demand de omnimodis decimis
quibuscunque is too general, 11 Rep. Herberts case. 1. To these exceptions
Hales answered, that a demand in a Writ of Dower need not to be so exact as in
other original Writs: for original Writs are not alterable, but ought to answer
the forms in the Register. To the second he said, that rectoria shall be
intended the Rectory of a Church, and the Statute extends not to this: besides
the place of the Rectory is described, which makes it certain enough. To the
third, it is not necessary to express the Tithes particularly, and the demand
being of the Rectory it compriseth all the Tithes, also the demand is de
omnimodis decimis which is a general demand, and compriseth all, and is not de
decimis only, for that might be uncertain. Holhead, The demand is de rectoria
and de omnimodis decimis which is a demand of one thing twice, and that is not
convenient, for by this means the party may recover damages twice, and the
Court will be also inveagled by this means, and it matters not though we have
not pleaded to this: for the Court ought to take notice of it, Notice.
because it is in the original Writ. Next there is no form in the Count, for
cum pertinentiis is informal, for it refers to the Parish, and not to the
Manor, 27 E. 3. f. 86. Pl. 3. Hale^, This is but a variance in form, and is
not material, and also it shall be intended to refer to the Manor, and not to
the Parish. Holhead, The demand is not warranted by the Writ, for the Vill and
Parish are not named in the Writ, but are named in the demand, 11 Rep. Arondels
case. Hales, The demand is not de rectoria in Tymsbury, but de Tymsbury, and is
the denomination of the thing demanded, Tithes. Parissi.
and not of the Vill where it lies. Holhead, It is not said, where the Tithes
extend, and they may extend to diverse Vills, as a Parish may, 19 E. 3. f. 9.
Hales, Here is one demand, and it includes all the Tithes. Roll Justice, You
have demanded the Rectory in Timber, and not the Rectory of Timber, and by the
grant of ones Manor in Dale, no more of it passes than what does lie in
Dale, and here it shall be intended so much of the Tithes as are in Timber.
Holhead, Here is a demand of Dower of such things whereof Dower lies not, viz.
of a quarry of Stones, and it appears not that the Quarry was open in the life
of her Husband; and if it were, yet it is improper to demand it by the name of
a Quarry. Hales, the word Quarry is a good word, and well-known what it means:
for Quarrera is an old wel-known Latin word for it, Dower.
and she is as well dowable of it as of a Mine of Coals, and it shall be
intended to be open, because she demands it by that name of a Quarry. Holhead,
The demand of the Dower is also of a Hundred, of which a Woman is not dowable,
because it is an entire thing, and cannot be divided, and the demand should
have been de tertia part proficuorum hundredi. To this Roll Justice answered,
then by your reason she shall never keep a Court. Hales, It is well enough
demanded, for a demand shall be of the thing it self, and not of the profits of
it, for the profits were not in the Husband, but he was seized of the Hundred,
and the profits are a thing uncertain. Holhead, The execution of the Habere
facias fesinam is not well executed, for by it two third parts are assigned for
Dower, and that is more than the demand. Hales, That is but a repetition of the
thing demanded. Holhead, A thing not demanded at all is assigned for Dower,
viz. view of Frank pledge. Hales, That is but an incident to another thing that
is demanded, viz. the Hundred, and by the demand of the Hundred the view of
Frank-pledge is demanded, and all other incidents to the Hundred. Holhead Here
is an assignment also of all tenures, and she cannot have Homage, because she
is a Woman. Hales, She shall have all tenures which she is capable of, and so
all shall be understood in this place, and no other she shall have. Holhead,
The Judgment is also if 15 Copiholds and Tenements which lately were
Copiholds. Roll Justice, This is good enough, and what loss have you by it?
Holhead, The Assignment is also of the 3d. part de Copicia and de Structuris,
and other words there are which are also uncertain. And there is error in the
assignment of damages: for the damages are assigned ultra valorem terrae,
which is against the Statute. Roll Justice, Damages. Judgment.
the Statute is an addition of the value and damages, for the Judgment is
perfect without returning the Writ of the damages, and so has been adjudged
in the Common pleas. Holhead, Here is an ill suggestion of the Feme, for the
suggesteth, that her Husband dyed seized in fee of all the Lands out of which
she demands her Dower, and that is not true, for he dyed seized of part of them
in tail. To this the Court said, that is not material if he dyed so seized,
that she ought to have Dower. Holhead, Damages are given ultra valorem, which
I conceive is not good. Roll Justice, It is well enough: for damages are
given, and the value by the Statute. Holhead, The retorn of the Elegit is not
good. Hales, That is another Record, and appears not now in the Court. Roll
Justice, The Elegit has no reference to the former Record. Holhead, There is
one error in fact, and that is confessed by your joining in demurrer.
Doubleness.
Roll Justice, You might have demurred for this doubleness, for one cannot
assign an error in fact, and another error in Law in a Writ of Error, for this
is double. Hales, It is true, but we have lost that advantage. Adjourned to be
argued again the next Term.

Robinson against
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
RObinson brought an Action of Trover and Conversion against T. B. Arrest of
Judgment in Trespass.
and has a verdict. The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, and showed for
cause, that the Declaration was not good, for the Plaintiff amongst other
things declares, that the Plaintiff had found and converted to his own use unum
vestigium, Anglice a Footstool, whereas it signifies a Footstep, or a print of
the foot, and not a Footstool. 2ly. The Plaintiff declares pro december ponderibus
Aeris, meaning ten pound of Brass, whereas it should be aeris with a Dipthong,
for Aeris is of Air, and not Brass. But this exception was overruled by the
Court, because in the writing of Court-hand, in which hand Declarations are
written, No Dipthongs in Court-hand.
there are no Dipthongs used, and so the word Aeris might as well signify
Brass as Air. But for the other exception, judgment was stayed till the
Plaintiff should move.

Izack against Green.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Izack brings an Action upon the Case in London against Green, For a Procedendo
to try an action in London.
for calling her Whore. Green removes the cause by a Habeas corpus into this
Court, and has a Supersedeas to stay the Plaintiffs proceedings in London. The
Plaintiffs Council moved for a Procedendo, that he might proceed in London,
because that in London, by a special Custom there an Action does lie for
calling a woman Whore, though out of London it lies not, and cited Pascal and
Barbars Case 21 Iac. to prove it. Bacon Justice, The custom of London is to be
certifyed that we may Judge of the reasonableness of it, and we are not to
take notice of it upon a surmise, and it seems that a procedendo should not
here be granted, Procedendo, Notice.
because the matter with which she is charged by the words belong to the
Conisance of the Civil law to try it, and not to our Law, as it is 2 H. 4.
Roll Justice, One may in some Cases have an Action at the Common law, where he
may have remedy also in the Ecclesiastical Court; for the Common law is to be
preferred, and by a special custom as the Case here is, an Action may be
maintained where it lies not at the Common law, and so was it held 8 Car. and
13 Car. And if there should not be a procedendo granted in this Case, the
Plaintiff would be tied up by the habeas corpus, but if it be granted the
matter may be tried, and upon that if the Judgment be erroneous a writ of
Error may be brought in the Hustings in London, and so all the matter may come
in question to be argued, Action.
and he said that a Charter cannot give an Action, which the Common law allows
not. But let the matter rest as it is till we can agree.

Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Plaintiff brought his Action upon the Case, Arrest of Judgment in an
action upon the case.
for these words, thou muttron-monger thief bring home my stolen hay. The
Defendant makes a special justification, that the Plaintiff had stolen a
sheep, and upon this was an issue joined, and a verdict for the Plaintiff. The
Defendant moves in arrest of Judgment that the Declaration was not good; for
it only charge the Defendant with speaking of the words, and does not say
dixit de querente, and though those words be in the replication, yet that makes
not the Declaration good. Roll Justice, The Declaration is not good, for the
words may be spoken of any other body, as well as of the Plaintiff. Bacon
Justice agrees with Roll, and said, that the word dixit was not in the
Declaration, and so it appears not whether the Defendant spoke, or writ, or
thought the words, and which is more it is not said, that the words were spoken
in the presence of any body, and then they cannot be scandalous; Roll Justice
said, one cannot rejoyn upon words, which are not in the Declaration nor in the
plea; for if the Declaration, and the plea be naught, Replication.
the replication cannot make them good. The rule of Court was nil capiat per
billam, except cause shown Saturday following.

Kinpe against Johnson.
Mich 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Pasc. 23 Car. rot. 154.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in Hull, Error upon a
Judgment in Hall. Continuance
for these Errors assigned. 1. That one of the continuances was to a certain
day of the mouth, where it ought to be ad proximam curiam; 2. The Declaration
was pro se december bestiis, Anglice Cows or Whyes, which is too general; for the
word bestia may signify any beast whatsoever as well as a Cow. The Judgment
was reversed except cause shown to the contrary.

More against Clipsam.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
MOre brings a Replevin against Clipsam, Argument upon a Replevin.
and declares of a hundred oves Matrices et vervices distrained by Clipsam.
Clipsam demurs to the Replevin for the incertainty of it; for it appears not
how many of the hundred sheep distrayned, and replevied, were Matrices, or
ewes, and how many were vervices, or weathers; Maynard moves for Judgment in
the Replevin for the Plaintiff, and held that centum oves alone was good, and
certain, and the addition Matrices, and vervices, shall not make an
incertainty, Incertainty.
and the writ of Replevin does not show the cattle distrained particularly,
but the help of the party, and the view of the Sheriff must concur to show
what Cattle are to be delivered by the writ. 2ly. Here is a good issue
argumentative, although it be not so formal. 3ly. Issue.
There is no more in the issue at the Bar, than in the avowry, for all the Term
is but one day, and there is no division of time in it, and it is dangerous to
make fractions, Term.
and a Statute acknowledged in the Term relates to the first day of the Term.
Statute. Relation.
Hales on the other side agreed that centum oves without saying any more had
been certain enough, but as they are here distinguished into Matrices, and
vervices, there is no certainty at all; for the Cattle in kind are demanded,
and ought to be delivered as they are demanded, so that if the demand be
uncertain there can be no certain delivery. 2ly. The issue is ill, and is not
helped by the verdict; for 1. the title made is not answered. 2. Traverse.
The traverse is only to the conclusion, and so is but by way of inference, and
is not helped after a verdict; for the plea is not answered: Advantage.
for the words fuit et adhuc est sesitus is not good, for it is not material
whether he were seized at the time of the distress or no, but whether he were
seized at the time of the replevin, and there is a distance between the
replevin, and the avowry, and there is a prius and a posterius in it. Roll
Justice said, it is made up in the retorn, and there is no distinction of time,
and if one plead an ill plea, Plea.
and the issue upon it be found against him, he shall not take advantage of his
own ill plea, and if there be a negative, and an affirmative, though the issue
be not well joined, it is helped by the Statute of Ieofailes, otherwise, if
there be not an affirmative, and a negative; for then there is no issue at all
joined to be helped. Bacon Justice, Oves matrices et vervices is ill; for the
Sheriff knows not what retorn to make; Roll accords, and said, you have made
that which was certain, to be uncertain by the specification you have made, and
a replevin is a demand, and ought to be as certain as a precipe. Judgment was
given against the Plaintiff in the case at the bar, because the Declaration was
ill, and uncertain.

Gilbert agaiast Stone.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. 23 Car. rot. 1703.
GIlbert brought an Action of Trespass quare clausum fregit, Demurrer upon a
plea in Trespass.
and taking of a gelding, against Stone. The Defendant pleads that he for fear
of his life, and wounding of twelve armed men, who threatened to kill him if he
did not the fact, went into the house of the Plaintiff, and took the gelding.
The Plaintiff demurred to this plea; Roll Justice, This is no plea to justify
the Defendant; Trespass.
for I may not do a Trespass to one for fear of threatenings of another, for by
this means the party injured shall have no satisfaction, for he cannot have it
of the party that threatened. Therefore let the Plaintiff have his Judgment.

Symons and Low.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. 23 Car. rot. 650.
SYmons brings an Action upon the Case against Low for speaking these words of
her, Error upon a Judgment for words. Plaint.
She, innuendo the Plaintiff, is perjured, and has a verdict, and a Judgment;
the Defendant brings a Writ of Error to reverse this Judgment, and assigns for
Error that the plaint was entered the same day that the words were spoken, which
was said ought not to be, because the Action should be brought after the words
spoken, Fractions.
which shall not be intended to be if it be the same day, because the Law
admits of no fractions of time, which will be, if a day be divided into several
parts, as it here must be, for there must be one hour supposed when the words
were spoken, and another hour when the plaint was entered. But Roll Justice
said, it was well enough, and ordered the Plaintiff to take her Judgment, if
cause were not shown before the end of the Term.

Cheevers against
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Upon a rule of Court to show cause why a scire facias to revive a Judgment was
not good, To quash a scire facias.
This was offered for cause, that it does not show before whom the Judgment was
given, which was to be revived by the scire facias, and consequently there
appears no Judgment to warrant the scire facias. To this Roll Justice
answered, that in the Common pleas the course is to set forth before whom the
Judgment is given, but in this Court the course is not so: But how comes the
Record hither? The Council answered, That there was a Judgment in Canterbury,
and upon that a Writ of Error was brought in this Court, and the Judgment
affirmed upon that Writ of Error, Scire facias.
and then a Scire facias issued out here upon the Judgment against the bail,
and upon this the bail moves upon the record, that there is error in the scire
facias. Roll Justice, The Record is well enough; In a scire facias it is not
requisite to say Consideratum est per curiam. Therefore let the scire facias
stand.

Carver and Pierce.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Case between Carver and Pierce was again moved by Hales, Arrest of
Judgment for words.
wherein it was moved formerly in arrest of Judgment that these words Thou art
a thief, and have stolen my dung are not actionable: That the words are
actionable for these reasons 1. The first words are actionable, and the second
words are accumulative, and aggravate the former words, and do not mitigate
them. 2. It may be felony to steal dung, and the violence of the words do
enforce it to be so intended. Bacon Justice, I hold that Judgment is to be
given for the Plaintiff, and so it was for these words, thou art a thief, and
have stolen my Corn. Roll Justice was of the same opinion, and said that the
second words are not violent enough to allay the first words, and are not
explanatory, and by way of mitigation; for the words are not, for thou have,
but they are, and thou have stolen my dung. Judgment was given for the
Plaintiff* antea.

Eeles and Lambert.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Case between Eeles and Lambert was again argued by Latch for the
Plaintiff, and by Twisden for the Defendant, Latch argued to this effect,
Argument upon a plea by an Executor. Legacy.
That the Legatee has no right in the legacy, until it be delivered unto him
by the Executor, 2 E. 4 fol. 13. but if a legacy be given in this manner, if I
dye let my Cosen have such a thing, there the Legatee may take the legacy
without the delivery of the Executor, and a thing which cannot be divided
cannot be administered. Bracton l. b. 2. C. 26. 7 H. 6. Administration. Devise.
A devise is void if there be not sufficient goods besides to satisfy the
Debts of the Testator. 2. The disposition of the Testator ought to agree with
the law of God, the law of nature, and the Law of the Land, and whereas it is
objected that there will be an inconvenience, if the legacies shall not be
paid, I answer, the Law regards not this inconveniencie; But 2ly. this
inconvenience is none in respect of the inconvenience will be on the other side
if the legacies be paid, namely the breaking of the Law of God, the Law of
Nature, and of the Land, and the inconveniences supposed are helped by the
Civil Law, Caution.
for it takes caution in paying of legacies to repay them in such accidents as
are in our Case. Twisden for the Defendant argued, that it was a good
administration of the goods, and that there is no assets in the hands of the
Executors, and he agrees that a devise of goods in specie, and a devise of money
is all one; but this is not a Debt, and so is not to be paid; for in Judgment
of Law, it is presumed that the Covenant shall not be broken, and that it shall
not be respected in regard of the incertainty whether it shall be broken or no,
but the Law takes notice of the Will, and it is of temporal conusans, 2 Rich.
3. 11 H. 7. f. 12. and it takes notice of a legacy to try the right of it, and
to discharge it, and the Executor here is compellable to pay the legacies, and
cannot refuse it neither by the Common law, nor by the Spiritual law; Covenant.
but it is objected that it is inconvenient that one shall avoid his own
Covenant by his own devise. To this I answer, he might have done it in his life
by giving away all his goods; and 2ly. There shall not be intended to be fraud
in the Will, and there are more inconveniences of our part in not paying the
Legacies, than on their part by paying them: for by this means, men shall have
no power to dispose of their own Goods by Will, by reason of Covenants in
Leases and Deeds made by them; and the Spiritual Court cannot compel a Legatee
to put in security for his Legacy, Security.
as is surmised. Adjourned to the next Term to give Judgment.

Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court was moved to deliver their opinion in a Case formerly moved,
Whether an Attornment good or not.
wherein the Question was, whether an Attornment made by a Lessee for years the
same day that the rent was due to be paid upon his Lease to him that had
purchased the reversion of the Land let unto him, and for which the Purchaser
had brought his Action, Attornment.
be a good Attornment. Roll Justice said, that it is a good Attornment by the
averment made, and by the finding of the Jury, and that Judgment ought to be
for the Plaintiff. Bacon Justice agrees, and said, the Attornment shall be
intended to be before Sun set, and not afterward. Therefore let the Plaintiff
take his Judgment.

Parmiter against Cressey.
Mich. 23 Car. Banc Reg.
THe Defendants Council upon a former rule of Court to show cause, Cause why
Judgment should not be given in an Action upon an Assumpsit. Averment. Notice.
Request.
offered for cause why the Plaintiff should not have Judgment. 1. Because the
Plaintiff had not averred that he did make any election of the Wines that the
Defendant was to deliver unto him. 2ly. He does not aver, that he gave the
Defendant any notice of his election, and there being a Condition precedent to
be performed on the Plaintiffs part, employed, the Defendant cannot perform the
Bargain, without notice of that performance. 2ly. Here is no good request
expressed either in substance or circumstance, for for the circumstance there
is but two days to do it, in which it cannot be well intended it could be
done. 2ly. It is said, he did not deliver vinum praedictum, which is an
uncertain implication of a Request: for the word deliberare is not a proper
term to express the Request, and the verdict does not help it. Bacon Justice,
There ought to be an election by the Plaintiff, but the Defedant ought first to
show the Wines, and it was of his part to have appointed the time when he would
show them. Roll Justice, The Promise and Request was at Norwitch, and it was
sufficient for the Plaintiff to make the Request there: but the Defendant ought
to show the Plaintiff the Wines, Election.
without which the Plaintiff can make no election, and the substance of the
Declaration is to this intent. Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
BY the rule of the Court, VV^^ a Prohibition should not be granted.
this day cause was offered to be shown why a Prohibition should not be granted
to the Ecclesiastical Court, for granting Letters of Administration to a Sister
of the half-blood, when there was a Brother of the whole-blood who sued for
them, and was denied. The cause showed was, that it is in the power of the
Ordinary to grant Administration, either to the Brother of the whole-blood, or
to the Sister of the halfblood, at his election, because they are in equal
degree of kin to the Intestate. And to this the Court agreed. But Bacon Justice
said, that in the Case at the Bur, Letters of Administration are granted to the
Husband and his Wife, and so to one, viz. the Husband, who is no kin at all to
the Intestate, but a Stranger, and if he survive his Wife, he shall have all
the Goods, and all the kindred will be defrauded, which is not reasonable, and
therefore the Administration is not good. And for this reason a Prohibition was
granted.

Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
IT was moved in arrest of Judgment, Arrest of Judgment in Trover and
Conversion.
that the Plaintiff had declared of the Trover and Conversson, of a cetrain
number expressed in the Declaration of pieces panni lanii, Anglice, of red,
yellow, and black Coath, which is uncertain, and cannot be used, as it is here,
to express Clothes of diverse colors, for panni lanii signifies only woollen
Clothes. But Bacon Justice said, all is but woollen Cloth, though they be of
diverse colors, and therefore it is good enough. Hodsden the Secondary said,
sometimes the colors are used to be expressed, and sometimes not. Bacon, It is
better to express the Colors than not, yet it is good enough without the
expressing of them. Therefore let the Plaintiff take his Judgment.

Willison and Crow:
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
VVillison brought an Action upon the Case against Crow, Arrest of Judgment in
an action for words.
for speaking these words of him, You are a bankrupt Skrub, and has a verdict;
it was moved in arrest of Judgment, that the words are not actionable, because
they are Adjective words, and so are not positive enough to ground an Action.
But the Court held, they were actionable, for the word Banckrupt in it self was
not an Adjective, and the joining of it with Skrub made it not so, but it
should be understood as much as to say, You are a Skrub, and also a Banckrupt.
And judgment was given accordingly.

The King against Holland.
Hill. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court delivered their opinions in the Case between the King and Holland
formerly argued; And first Bacon Justice said, Judgment given in the Case
between the King and Holland.
that there can be no Judgment, for there is a mis-tryal in it; for first,
there is no Venire facias: and secondly, there is a discontinuance, because the
Venire should be to retorn duodecem probos and legales homines quorum quilibet
habet 40 s. lands by the year at the least, and it is every of whom, having 4
l. lands by the year, which is contrary to the direction of the Statute. To
this Roll answered, that he held the Venire to be good, and so the trial good,
for if the Jury has every of them 4 l. a year in Lands, he has 40 s. a year
in Lands at least, and more, and therefore it is a better Jury, and more
sufficient; and by this the verdict shall not be vitiated, though the Venire be
not quorum quilibet habet 40 s. per annum ad minus, as the Statute directs, and
he cited 21 Iac. Philpot and Fielders Case to be so adjudged; and he said, that
Lands in the hands of a Trustee may be extended for the Kings debt, Extent.
but that he did not conceive how the King can have Copyhold-lands that are in
trust for an Alien. Seisuie.
Bacon Justice, The Commissioners that found this inquisition for the King had
no power by their Commission to seize the Lands into the Kings hands, but only
to enquire what Lands the Alien had. The Court ordered, that cause should be
shown Tuesday following, why the party shall not be restored to his Lands,
which were seized into the Kings hands by virtue of the Inquisition. Postea.

Hill. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in an Action upon the
Case, Error upon a Judgment in an Action up-the Case. Incertainty. Trial.
upon an Assumpsit, brought by two at Maydston in Kent, and the Error assigned
was, that the Plaintifs in their Declaration do say unde dixerunt quod
deteriorati sunt, etc. whereas it should be unde deteriorati sunt, and not
dixerunt, etc. for that is positive, and the other not, for they may say they
are damnified, and be not, and there can be no trial upon such uncertain words.
Roll Justice said, the words are not well laid; yet if there were other words
sufficient to express the damage the Plaintiff had received it would be good
enough, but these words here govern the whole sentence; Therefore let the
Defendant in the Writ of Error consider how he can make the Declaration good.

The King against Savage.
Hill. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
ONe Savage was arraigned in this Court upon an Endictment of Felony, For
quashing an Endictment for Felony.
for killing of a Woman within the Verge. The truth of the Case was, he beat
and wounded the Woman at Lesne Abbey in Kent, which is within the Verge, but the
Woman dyed at Sevenock in Kent, which is out of the Verge. The Prisoner prayed
the Court he might have Walker of the Inner Temple assigned him for Council,
for matter in Law, which the Court granted. Walker for the Prisoner, prays the
Endictment may be read, which was done accordingly; Whereupon he took these
exceptions to it, 1. That the Endictment does not show upon what part of the
body particularly the Woman was wounded, but it says only generally, that it
was upon the hinder parts of her Body. 2ly. It says the Woman dyed de diversis
plagis, but it does not show of what length and breadth the wounds were, as it
ought to do, nor does it say of which of the wounds she dyed, and so it is
uncertain, Incertainty.
and cannot be known whether the Wounds were mortal or no. 3ly. By the Statute
de Articulis super Chartas, in this Case where the party was wounded within the
Verge, and dyed without the Verge, the Coroner of the Verge, and of the County
ought to join in taking the Iuquisition super visum Corporis, Inquisition.
which is not here done; but the Inquisition is taken by the Coroner of the
Verge only. Bacon Justice said, the party is said to be slain where he dies,
not where he was wounded. The Court ordered the Prisoner to appear a week
after, and in the mean time to give notice to the Kings Council of the
Exceptions taken to the Endictment, and know whether they will maintain the
Endictment; Bail.
the same Term the Endictment was adjudged not good, and the party was bayled.

Thyn against Thyn.
Hill. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hill. 22 Car. rot. 1638.
DAme Katherine Thyn brings a Writ of Dower in the Common Pleas against Sir
James Thyn, and has a Verdict, and a Judgment; Error in a Writ of Error.
Retorn.
the Defendant brings a Writ of Error to reverse this Judgment in this Court,
and assigns for Error; 1. In the Retorn made by the Sheriff, for he does not
say, that the Proclamation was made at the Church of the Town, where the
Summons was made, Summons.
and a Summons upon any one part of the Land, as has been objected on the
other side, is not good, neither by the words, nor the intent of the Statute:
for then the words in the Statute should be surplusage and idle, that
particularly directs how it should be. And as to the Objection, Fiction of Law.
Statute.
That a Summons upon one part of the Land is good in fiction of Law, for the
rest of the Land, I answer, That this is not so where the Statute directs the
Summons, and the words secundum formam Statuti cannot help where the Statute is
not showed to be pursued; and so says Dyer, That substantial words ought to be
mentioned, Hill. 24 Iac. H^b. Pl, 179. Allen and Walkers Case. 2ly. Demand.
There is Error in the Demand of the Dower for the certainty of the Tithes
demanded ought to appear, and it does not so here, 11 Rep. Harpers Case, f. 25.
And for that which is said in answer unto this, That a Demand of Dower is
different from other Demands, I agree it to be true, 8. H. 6. 3. Yet the things
demanded in Dower must be certainly demanded, 11 H. 7. f. 25. as it is in an
Assise, for an Assise de uno tenemento is not good for the incertainty, Assise.
4 E. 2. Fitzh. Assise, 45 1. Estovers demanded ought to be showed
particularly; so is it of a Corrody, 11 E. 3. Fitzh. Dower, 85. Dyer, f. 84. 7
E. 6. Pasc. 5 Iac. the Countess of Oxfords Case; and whereas there has this
difference been taken between a Demand of Tithes in gross, and of Tithes
appendant, and that Tithes in gross must be particularly demanded, but it is
not necessary to demand Tithes appendat particularly, I answer, This is not so,
for their appendancy does not make them not to be demanded particularly, no
more than if they were in gross, 18 E. 2. Asise, 377. A Corrody must be
particularly demanded, and all the Presidents prove it, and it was so held,
Pasc. 8 Car. rot. 271. in Bruer and Drakes case in a writ of Error in this
Court, upon a judgment given in Dower in the Common Pleas. A 2d. exception to
the Demand of the Dower is this, the Writ of Dower is de manerio de Imber, and
the Demand is of Dower in parochia de Imber, and so it is larger than the Writ:
Parish.
for a Parish may comprehend many Vills. Stat. 1 H. 5. C. 5. 22 E. 4. C. 2.
Mich. 34 Eliz. rot. 1537. Brad and Bishops Case in the Exchequer, Pasc. 38
Eliz. Bedel and Scarborows Case in an Ejectione firmae in this Court. It is
true, that generally a Parish shall not be intended larger than a Vill, if the
contrary do not appear: but here the contrary does appear by the words of the
Demand, which are de rectoria de Imber and Tymesbury infra parochia de Imber,
3, and 4 Phillip and Mary, Dyer, 142. and the different penning and expression
of the Demand is to be observed: Grant. Abatement. Variance.
for by that it appears there is a difference between Imber, and the Parish of
Imber, Grants, Fitzh. 87. by granting a Manor with the appurtenances, an
Advowson will pass, 19 E. 2. Tit. brief, the Writ abated, for variance between
the Writ and the Count. A 4th. Error is to avoid the execution, because of the
Error in fait: for the Hundred of Warmister does extend to Sutton parva which
is not named in the Writ, and so the damages are given for more than is
demanded, Damages. Intendment.
and it shall not be interpreted by Intendment, and the Hundred is not

Chambers against VVollaston.
Hill. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Mich. 22 Car. rot. 21.
CHambers brought an Action of Assault and Battery, Demurrer upon the Custom of
London pleaded.
and false imprisonment against Wollaston, Wollaston pleads a special Plea of
Justification, by virtue of a Custom in the City of London, whereby he had
authority to take and imprison him for disturbing an Election of Wardens of a
Company, and until he would promise not to disturb such Elections afterward.
To this Plea the Plaintiff demurs, and takes these Exceptions, 1. Custom.
The Custom pleaded is against Law, for it appears not that there was any suit
depending either by Bill, or Endictment, or otherwise, and so the Custom is
against Law, Stat. 25 E. 3. C. 4. 25 E. 3. C. 3. and so was the Petition of
Right, 3 Car. And though the Customs of the City of London are confirmed by
Statute Law, yet illegal Customs are not confirmed. 2ly. Judgment.
The Judgment is against Law, for by the Judgment no remedy is given for the
offense committed to the party against whom it is committed, but only that the
offender shall be imprisoned until he promise not to disturb Elections again.
3ly. The party committed is not within the Custom by the Defendants own
showing. 4ly. The Custom set forth is not prosecuted: for the commitment is
not for the Disturbance, but because the party will not promise not to disturb
again. 5ly. The detension of the party in prison is against Law. Hales of
Council with the Defendant, desired time to argue, and the Court desired to
have Books.

Holdigh against Chase.
Hill. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Pasc. 23 Car. rot. 326.
HOldigh brought an Action of Debt against Chase, A special Verdict upon Non
est sactum, pleaded to a boad.
as an Executor, upon an Obligation made to the Testator. The Defendant pleaded
non est factum, and upon this Plea an Issue was joined, and a special Verdict
found; upon which Verdict the Case appeared to be this, The Defendant Chase was
bound in an obligation for the payment of a certain sum of money unto A. B. and
to I. S. jointly. I. S. dies, A. B. survives, and makes Holdigh his Executor,
and dies, Holdigh brings an Action of Debt in his own name against Chase the
Defendant, and declares upon this obligation made to the Testator, and to I. S.
and does not aver that the Testator did survive I. S. The Defendant pleads non
est factum, and the question was whether this be a good plea or no, and to
prove that it is no good plea, Plea.
but that it was the deed of the Defendant, the Council for the Plaintiff cited
these books, 3. H. 6. 4. 35 H. 6. fol. 39. 46 E. 3. 7. 14 E. 4. fol. 4. 18 E.
2. 2. and put this case. Two enfants joyntenants alien, and one dies; The
surviver brings a dum fuit infra aetatem, and counts of the Feofment of one of
them, and there the right was adjudged not to be severed by the Feoffement, and
so the writ good, and in our case the matter of variance alleged goes to the
writ, and not the Action, and it is now too late for the Defendant to take
advantage of it, and prays Judgment for the Plaintiff. Roll Justice said, the
issue is whether it be the Defendants deed or not, and without doubt it is his
deed, and therefore let him show cause why the Plaintiff should not have
Judgment.

Boon against Sheers.
Hill. 23. Ba. Reg.
Trin. 23 Car. rot. 288.
Boon brought an Action of Debt upon an obligation of 400 l. Demurrer to a
Plea.
against Sheers, and declares that the condition of the obligation was, that
the Defendant should make such a voyage with a Ship, and pay certain monyes at
his return, and other conditions mentioned, and for not performing the
conditions he brings his Action. The Defendant pleads in bar that the Ship was
taken in the voyage per homines bellicosos, Plea.
and demands Judgment of the Action: To this plea the Plaintiff demurred, and
showed for cause that the Plea did not give answer to all the Declaration.
Demurrer.
Yard of Council with the Defendant said, the plea was good; for the plea
answers the whole condition of the Bond, which was first to make the voyage
with the Ship, and then at his retorn to perform the other conditions, and
being hindered in the one, he was not bound to perform the other. Bacon Justice,
Let us see a book to consider of.

Royston against Mees.
Hill 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
ROyston makes a lease for years of certain lands to I. S. rendering rent,
Arrest of Judgment in Debt.
the lessee makes his will, and makes Mees the Defendant his Executor, and
dies, the Executor possesses himself of the remainder of the term of the lands
let, and after the rent is behind. Royston brings an Action of Debt against the
Defendant, and declares against him for the rent so behind in the debet and
detinet, and upon this an issue is joined, and a verdict for the Plaintiff. The
Defendant moves in arrest of Judgment, Declaration.
and shows for cause that the Declaration is not good, because the Action being
an Action of Debt brought against the Defendant, as an Executor, it ought to
have been in the detinet, and not in the debet and detinet. But Wild of
Council with the Plaintiff argued that the Declaration was good, and the Action
well brought in the debet and detinet, and cited Brook title extinguishment 34.
and the comment 526. and said, it is an Action founded upon a lease by deed
which was made by the Testator, and cited 20 H. 6.10 H. 7. fol. 50. And that it
is the constant: form of charging Executors in such cases, 14 H. 4. fol. 29.

found it in the debet and detinet which shall be intended to be true, 9 Ed.
4.41.17 Jac. Paul and Mordyes Case in the Common pleas, and 7 Iac. Smith and
Nicholas Case, and prays Judgment for the Plaintiff. Hales for the Defendant
argued that the Declaration is not good. 1. He said, the Action is good in the
detinet, because the profits of the land let, which are over and above the rent
to be paid for it, reserved upon the lease, shall be only assets in the
Executors hands. Difference. Contract.
2. It cannot be good both ways, and the Term is in him as Executor, not the
rent, and there is a difference between contracts Executory, and contracts
Executed; but it may he said, the rent to be paid may be more than the profits
of the land is worth, ^ answer, this shall not be presumed in law if it be not
so showed. 43 Ass. pl. 23.16 H 7. fol. ^. The Action is brought for all the
rent incurred; therefore it shall not be presumed that the land is not worth
the rent that is paid for it: Verdict.
and as for the verdict it shall help nothing; for a verdict shall not supply a
necessary part of a Declaration omitted, and if he owes then he detains, and I
conceive Hargraves Case to be good Law, though denied by the Council on the
other side, and here the privity of the contract is not determined, and so
prays Judgment for the Defendant. Roll Justice, It is for the advantage of
the Executor to bring the Action in the detinet; for then he sh ll be charged
only for the goods of the Testator, and not for his proper goods and it may be
the land is less worth than the rent, and that the parties have consented the
Action should be brought in this manner. Bacon Justice cited Pawls Case Mich. 17
Iac. But entered Pasc. rot. 346. That the Action may be brought in the debet and
detinet, and if the Plaintiff will bring his Action here in the detinet it is
not for your disadvantage, and he may at his election bring it either way. Roll
Justice, Here the verdict answers the point of the issue, and therefore is
good. The Court ruled the Plaintiff to take his Judgment, except better cause
shown to the contrary.

William against Tyrer.
Hill. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Pasc. 23 Car. rot. 224.
William brought an Action of Trover and Conversion against Tyrer for certain
goods of the Plaintiff the Plaintiff has a verdict, Arrest of Judgment in
Covenant.
The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, and took these exceptions to the
Declaration. 1. The Plaintiff declares pro tribus duodenis fili, Anglice dosens
of thread, Declaration.
which is uncertain; for it may be three dosen pound of thread, or skenes of
thread, or ounces of thread. To this it was answered, that it cannot be
otherwise expressed, and the words dosens of thread is used amongst Merchants,
and well known unto them what is meant by them. 2ly. He declares for so many
pounds Muscat. in stead of Nucum Muscat. ram, Anglice Nutmegs. But this
exception was mistaken, for the record was otherwise, and besides it was with
an Anglice which makes it certain. The Court ruled Judgment to be entered
except cause showed for the Plaintiff.

Rawson against Bargue.
Hill. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Case between Rawson and Bargue being an Action of Debt upon the Statute of
2 E. 6. for not setting forth of Tithes, ^ Arguments whether a free Chapel or
no, and the Judges opinions.
wherein upon a special verdict, the question was whether the Church were a
free Chapel given to the King, within the Statute of 1 Ed. 6. was again argued
by Latch for the Plaintiff, and by Brown for the Defendant, Latches argument
was to this effect. 1. He said, that the Law says it is presentative although
it be not; and 2ly. It is sufficiently found to be a parochial Church, yet it
is not material whether it be found so or no. Next the words of the Statute do
not extend to give donatives to the King. 3ly. It is not given to the Crown,
and although the Declatation and verdict be that it is a free Chapel, yet it
is not comprehended as a Chapel presentative. Lit. 94. The word free makes a
distinction of things, and the party ought not to confound things, Free Chapel.
and a free Chapel is always interpreted for a Church donative, and not
presentative. The right investiture of Churches was challenged from the
foundation of them, until within this 400 years it was altered by the Common
law; Seldens History of Tithes, fol. 392. and upon that alteration the name of
a free Chapel came. Reg. 41. It is said to be free from ecclesiastical
jurisdiction. Fitz. tit. Brief 6.0.3 Ed. 3. Fitz. Tit. Aid du roy 33.14 H.

Chapels extend to presentatives, Presentation. Donative.
because they are with cure, Lit. Com. 344. a donative may be parochial, 7 E.
3. f. 4. To this I answer, Churches had cure of souls, when they were
donatives. To the 2d. point, by the meaning of the Statute it appears, Tenure.
Frank-almoigne.
that only donatives were intended, as the preamble of it does declare; And all
Chapels are held in Frank almoigne as well as donatives, and so all may be
given to the King by the same reason. Another objection is that the word
Capella is superstitious, and therefore being of a superstitious foundation it
is given to the King, and Cowels Interpretor is urged to prove the word to be
so derived, To this I answer, that Sir Henry Spelman as learned an Author as
Cowell, in his glossary rejects Cowells derivation of the word Capella, and
says that Capella is used promiscuously for any upper covering; And though the
name were superstitious, yet that makes not the Chapel to be so; for so the
Church of St. Andrew, or St. Dunstan, should be superstitious, and given to the
King by the Statute. There is a double preamble of the Statute, 1. A recital
of another Statute, Preamble.
and the taking away of other superstitious uses. Preamble of the Statute, 37

Words of a Statute ought not to be interpreted to destroy natural Justice.
The style also of the Act does not show that donatives are only intended, and
the Crown has not granted this away, 37 H. 8. and so not destroyed them.
Donatives usually pass as lay fees, and the passing of them as lay fees alters
not the nature of the Chapells, and the Statute gives it to the King as the
incumbent had it, Lay fee.
and there is a saving of the nature of it in the Statute. It is objected, that
he has not been presented ratione lapsus. To this Hob. 337. in Greens Case
gives an answer, and Potters Case 9 Car. in the Common pleas, and it is well
found here in the verdict for the Plaintiff, That it is not within the Statute.
Brown for the Defendant in his argument said, the question is whether it be a
free Chapel, given by the Statute of 1 Ed. 6. and 1. It is within the words of
the Statute; and 2ly. It is within the meaning of the Statute; for the words
they are simplicitur generalia, and so large as can be, and all Chapels are
given by them, and none excepted. And here 1. The nature of a free Chapel is
to be considered; For Cowel he is not fit to be cited, Cowel^ Book.

finds it to be in the foundation of it. 2ly. The Plaintiff brings the Action as
Rector of a free Chapel, and now he shall not be suffered to deny his own
Declaration. 3ly. The admission, institution, and induction implies
jurisdiction till the contrary appear, viz. that it is a free Chapel

presentative, though it were not so before. This is answered, 14 E. Fitz. 9 E.
3 ^^. 27 E. 3.34. It is not the presentation made by the party, but the
foundation that makes it presentative. 2ly. It is objected that it is
parochial, and therefore is not free; I answer, it is not so found although it
be so claimed, and though it be so claimed it makes nothing to the purpose. The
parish Church of St. Maryes in Shrewsbury was parochial, and yet given to the
King by this Statute, 13 H. 4. Fitz. brev. 807. Hill. 17. Iac. in this Court in

Church, and such are given to the King, Dyer 267. o Car. Pasc. in the Common
pleas Rawlins and Yaxlyes Case. 2ly. For the words of the Statute this is not
one of the free Chapels excepted in the Statute, and therefore it is within the
Statute, and there appears no visitation in the verdict found, and exceptio in
non exceptis format regulam. For the meaning of the Stat. Interpretation

together if it may be, and one part of it ought not to destroy another part,
generale dictum generaliter est intelligendum; The exceptions of the Statute
show the meaning of it. It is objected, that the being a free Chapel makes it
not to be superstitious, I answer, if it be a free Chapel by Common intendment
it is superstitious, but though if it be not, yet it is given by the name of a
free Chapel. By the verdict it was taken for a free Chapel, and that it was
seized into the Kings hands. There is much light to be had in interpretation of
laws, by consulting with those that made them, and to know how they had
interpreted them; for expositio contemporanea est optima. Plow. 466. Pasc. 35

and enough to give it to the Crown: And the presentation to it is ad rectoriam

presentation, Presentation
because the King was not rightly informed what it was he presented to, Regist.
fol. 203. 19 E. 3 Fitz. quar. imped. 360. and so prays Judgment for the
Plaintiff. Roll Justice, There is a difference where a Chapel is founded
within a Church, and where the Chapel is Parochial. Bacon Justice held, that it
was given to the King by the Statute; for it is found to be a Chapel paying
tenthes, and this Statute looks backward to the Statute of 37 H. 8. and to
things in being, and the Chapel was within that Statute, and by it he might
have seized it, and it is within the words, and intent also of the Statute of 1
Ed. 6. and the proviso of the Statute shows the meaning of it, and Capellae
dependentes, or Chapels of ease are not given by the Statute. Roll Justice to
the same effect, and said, This Statute of 1 Ed. 6. was made to supply
something omitted in the Statute of 37 H. 8. and it is plain, that it is within
the words, and we have no warrant to interpret it otherwise, since it does not
appear that it is excepted; also it is not found to be a Parish Church, but
that they claim it to be so, and if it were it would not help. 2ly. It may be
presentative, and yet a free Chapel according to the foundation, and endowment
of it, and a free Chapel, may become a Church by presentation of the Patron,
but it appears not to be so to us. The proviso of the Statute shows that it was
not the intent of the Statute, to exempt all free Chapels, but those only which
are named, and no more: And the intent of the Statute was that the King shall
have it as a lay thing, and he was not compelled to present, and here the
Patron has taken the profits, and there are no inhabitants within the Parish,
for the seignory compriseth all the parish, and if the King presents by lapse
where he ought to do it pleno jure, the presentation is not good. For these
reasons, The Judgment was given for the Defendant, if better matter be not
shown before the end of the Term.

Fulham.
Hill 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
FUlham had a Judgment in this Court against 3 Defendants, For Execiuion

two of the Defendants bring a writ of Error in Parliament. Fulham that had the
judgment moves the Court, he may have Execution upon his judgment
notwithstanding the Writ of Error brought in Parliament, because the Record is
not well removed, for the Writ of Error is not good, for the Judgment is
against three, and the Writ of Error mentions but two of them. Roll Justice, I
doubt you cannot have execution, but the Writ of Error must be abated in
Parliament, Abatement. Execution.
and then you may come here and move for execution, for now it is not safe to
grant it. Move it in Parliament to have it abated, or move here again at your
own adventure.

after diverse arguments at the Bar, and the opinion of the Court delivered, The
Court was moved for an Amoveas manum to the Chancery, that the party may have
his Land out of the Kings hand. The Court answered, The Judgment is to be

not to go to the Chancery. And all that we can say is, that the King shall not
have Judgment. Judgment.


Hill. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court was moved to quash an Endictment of forcible Entry upon these
Exceptions. For quashing an Endictment.
1. That it did not say, that the forcible Entry was contra Coronam and
dignitatem, but this the Court overruled. A second exception was, That it does
not show that the party was felted at the time until the Defendant entered by
force upon him. 3ly. The Endictment concludes, contra formam Statuti, and it
ought to be statutorum, for the Statute of 8 H. 6. upon which this Endictment
is framed, relates to other Statutes. To this the Court said, if the Endictment
be so it is ill. 4ly. The Endictment says, Endictment.
he entered peaceably and detained with force, and such an Endictment has
relation to two Statutes. To this it was answered, that the Statute of 8 H. 6.
is sufficient to found the Endictment without relation to other Statutes, for
this clause upon which this Endictment is framed, is a new Law, and has no
relation to precedent Statutes, for it is here only for a forcible deteyner.
Roll Justice doubted of this, for it is said, that the Statute of 8 H. 6. shall
be added to the new Statute. Bacon Justice differed in opinion and said, the
Statute of 8 H. 6. was not made to piece up the other Statute, but is a new Law
as to this clause. The Court will advise further.

Chambers against VVollaston.
Hill. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
THis Case was again moved and argued by Ward of Council with the Plaintiff.
Argument upon a special Plea.
The Action was an Action of Assault and Battery, and false imprisonment, The
Defendant pleased a special Justification by virtue of the Custom of the City;
To which Plea the Plaintiff demurred, six points were spoken to by the
Plaintiffs Council in his Argument. 1. Custom.
He said, the proceedings against Chambers were neither agreeable to the Common
law, nor to Magna Charta, and therefore illegal, and not warrantable,
notwithstanding the Custom pleaded to back them. 2ly. The Custom it self is
not well pursued, Bracton, 55.5 Rep. 64. The King cannot grant power to a Court
to commit against the Common Law, or Statute Law, Magna Charta, 54.42 Ass. Pl.
5. and though one submit himself to be committed, Submission.
for a thing for which he is not committable by Law, this submission is void.
3ly. The Custom pleaded is against Magna Charra, and diverse other Statutes,
Stat. 9 H. 6. cap. 5. 8 E. 3. Cooks Magn. Chart. f. 16. Bracton, 334, 335.43 E.
3. f. 32. Pleadings.
and it appears not the pleadings were in Latin, as they ought to be, 36 E. 3.
neither was the Confession legal, nor entered upon Record. 3ly. Judgment.
The Judgment varies from all other Judgments in Law: for the Commitment was,
that he should stand committed until he would promise that he will disturb no
more; And ^ly. until the Court should take further order, and this is against
Law, 8 Rep. f. 59.2 Instit. 52. 5ly. The Statute of Rich. 3d. confirms not the
Custom, for if it was before Magna Charta it is taken away by that Statute, for
it is not excepted in it, Magna Charta cap. 19. 29. Miror of Justice, cap. 5.
Long Quint. 40, 41. 6ly. The Custom is not well pursued in the Return, for the
Oath extends to be obedient to the Bailiff, Retorn.
etc. for the time being, but the Return is not so: but it said, that he be
obedient to good Laws, and this is not in the Oath. And the Retorn is against
their Custom, and Judgment for the Commitment, and so he praid Judgment for
the Plaintiff. Roll Justice said, That the Judgment and the Retorn are
contrary: tor the Judgment was, that he shall be committed, because he would
not promise, not to disturb: and the Retorn is, that he promise that he will
not disturb. Cause was to be shown why the Plaintiff should not have Judgment.

The King and Apsley.

APsley removed certain orders made against him by the Commissioners of Sewers
for Westminster, by a Certiorari into this Court. To quash orders of
Commissioners of Sewers.
And upon the Retorn these exceptions were taken. 1. That it does not say the
Commission of Sewers was under the Great Seal, as it ought to express, 7 Car.
Allen and Carter, and 5 Car. Rayl and Mannings Case, and Pasc. 14 Car. Hungates
Case, and because it is not so set forth there can no Issue be taken, whether
they be Commissioners or not. 2ly. The Commission is not well pleaded, for it
appears not that three of them were of the quorum, as the Statute appoints
there should be. 3ly. The Retorn is in English, and it ought to be in Latin.
But to this Roll Justice answered, Retorn.
That the Retorn is good notwithstanding, for the Commission is in English.
4ly. It does not appear, that Hartshorn lane, touching which their orders were
made is within Westminster, and so it cannot be well-known, whether it was
within their power* by virtue of their Commission to make any orders touching
that place. Hales of Council for the Commissioners moved, the Retorn might be
amended. But the Court answered, It could not be, Amendment.
because the Retorn was made the Term before. And it was ordered, that cause
should be shown Tuesday following, why the Retorn and Proceedings should not be
quashed.

The King against Page and Harwood.
Hill. 23 Car Banc. Reg.
THree men were endicted at an Assizes in the Country for Felony, Qustion upon
the Statute of Stabbing, whether Principle or Accessory, Principle. Accessory.
for killing of a man, the Endictment was framed upon the Statute of 1 Iac.
made against Stabbing; They were all found guilty. He that did the fact was
condemned, and executed: but because the Justice of Assise doubted whether the
other two wers Principles within that Statute, or but Accessories, they would
not proceed to Judgment against them; Whereupon they were brought to this Bar
to be proceeded against for the Felony, and the doubt was, in regard they were
only present, and abetting the person that did the fact, and used no Action
toward the death of the party, whether they were Principles within the
Statute, or but Accessories, Roll Justice said, They are not Principles, Clergy.
but Accessories, and ought to have their Clergy: for the Statute of Stabbing
being a penal Law, it shall be taken strictly and not extended to equity, and
in Swinertons case Bramston, Barkley, and Jones, three of the Judges of this
Court directed the Jury, the Case being of the same nature with this, to find
the parties only accessory. But the Jury in our Case have found them guilty as
Principles, and I doubt upon that, whether the Trial be good or no. Trial.
Walker of Council against the Prisoners said, the Statute of Stabbing makes no
new offense, and therefore it is doubtful, End ctment.
wheher it be necessary for the Endictment to conclude contra formam Statuti.
Roll Justice said, it ought to be so. But Bacon Justice doubted. The Court
admitted the Prisoners to their Clergy, and they were burnt in the hand in view
of the Court by the Hangman of London, and the Prisoners bound each for the
other to their good behaviors, and to appear in Court the next Term.

Venire, it is duodecim, etc. and does not say probos and legales homines. Bacon
Justice, Duodecim in the Venire, with an etc. is not good in an Inferior
Court, but this is in the awarding of the Venire, and therefore well enough,
but the first is a good Exception in my Judgment. Therefore let the judgment
be reversed, except cause shown to the contrary.

The King and Corye.
A Writ of Restitution issued out of this Court for one Corye to be restored to
the Recorders place of the City of Norwitch, To be restored to a Recorders
place.
which was returned and filed. Hales of his Council opened the Retorn and cited
Stroods Case, that one ought not to be removed from any office without showing
good cause why he is removed, which is not here done, but only a Custom set
forth, whereby they show they had authority to elect a Recorder for a year
only, and at the end of the year to elect another, and that by virtue of this
Custom, Custom.
they had chosen another Recorder in the parties place, he having been in a
whole year, which he conceived to be an ill Custom. Roll Justice said, If this
be a void Custom, none of the two Recorders were well elected, and so Cory
cannot be restored. And Bacon Justice did also doubt, whether any of them were
well chosen. It was said, that the Retorn is not traversable, but shall be
taken to be true. Bacon Justice held, Traverse. Retorn.
That the Retorn was not good, and you must have an Alias, that we may have a
better Answer before us: for nothing can be done upon this. But the Court
inclined, that a Recorder may be elected for one year. It was said. If a Custom
be entire you cannot make one part of it good, and another part of it ill. The
rule was, for the party to take an Alias, because this Retorn is not good, and
it is too late to amend it, because it is filed. Amendment.


The King and Symmons.
IN an Endictment of forcible Entry upon the Statute of 8 H. 6. diverse
Exceptions were formerly taken. To quash an Endictment upon the Statu^e of 8 H.
6.
Roll Justice answered to that, that the Endictment did not say, contra Coronam
and dignitatem, it was well enough without those words. Another exception was
now taken, that the Endictment is ad tunc and ibidem, which is repugnant. This
Roll Justice overruled, but he doubted whether the Endictment ought to be
contra formam Satutorum, or contra formam Statuti as it is, because this
Endictment is framed upon diverse Statutes. Bacon Justice cited the 4th. Rep.
the Case of Appeals, and said, it is good as it is contra formam Statuti, and
said, that a forcible Entry and Deteyner is punishable at the Common Law.

Hill. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
MAynard shows for cause why a Prohibition should not be granted to the
Admiralty, For a Prohibition notwithstanding a Consultation granted.
That the parties have moved this matter in the Common Pleas, and did there
join issue upon the same, and a verdict passed against the Prohibition, and a
consultation was thereupon granted. The Council on the other side makes another
suggestion, viz. that the sentence in the Court of Admiralty, was against a
person that was dead, and that one of the parties who had the sentence had
released. To this the Court said, you might have pleaded this in the Admiral
Court. Hill of Council for the Prohibition said, it is not material what the
parties have done in the Common Pleas, for this Court is not bound by it. Roll
Justice, If the matter of your surmise here be tried already in the
Common Pleas, why should you move here upon the same surmise. Surmise.
Arbitrary. Conclusion.
But it is not arbitrary to grant a Prohibition or not to grant it, if there be
cause to grant it, and the Trial in the Common Pleas is no conclusion to us,
and if it be mischievous as is objected, Prohibition.
to grant a Prohibition after a Consultation granted, the Parliament may make a
Law to prevent that mischief, for as the Law now is it may be done; Yet we will
advise.

in the Common pleas, upon fully administered pleaded, and a writ of Error was
here brought to reverse the Judgment. The Error assigned was, that Judgment
was given for the whole Debt, whereas the verdict found that the Defendant had
assets only to discharge a part of it. To this the Court said, if it be found
he have any assets, Judgment must be given against him, for the whole debt
upon his false plea, but if he have no assets it is otherwise

Chambers against Floyd.
Hill. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
Upon a rule on the Crown side to show cause why an Attatchment should not
issue out against two Justices of peace for not allowing a certiorari directed
to them out of this Court to remove an endictment of forceible entry taken at a
private Sessions before them. Cause against issuing of an attatchment.
The Council for the Justices urged, that they had not contemned the Process
of this Court as is surmised; for the certiorari ought to have been delivered
in open Sessions of the peace, and there allowed; Allowance.
but this was delivered at a private Sessions, and so they were not to allow it.
2ly. The party who procures the certiorari, ought according to the Statute, to
put in security, Certiorari.
at the delivery thereof, to prosecute, or else it is not to be allowed, but
that was not done here, and therefore they were not bound to allow it: And the
certiorari is to remove an Endictment of forcible entry; but the retorn is that
it was a peaceable entry, and a forcible deteyner, Retorn.
so that there being no such Endictment before them as the certiorari mentions,
they could not make a retorn according to the writ, and therefore it is no
contempt in the Justices not to make a return. The Court answered, Contempt.
that it is the usual course of the Court to make certioraries in this form,
and therefore this is no excuse; The Council against the Justices urged, that
this case is within the Statute, though it were at a private Sessions of the
peace, and therefore the Justices are in contempt. Roll Justice said, I
conceive that this is casus omissus not provided for by the Statute, and if so,
then are they not in contempt, Casus omissus,
and if some Justices take an Endictment of forcible entry, other Justices
cannot give restitution upon this Endictment. Bacon Justice, Restitution.
The Statute is a remedial Law, and made for the ease of the subject, and ought
not to be construed strictly: And said, Construction.
that a private Sessions is a Sessions; but security ought to be put in at the
quarter Sessions, for it shall be intended that all the Justices of the County
are there. Roll Justice said, Security.
that a private Sessions ought to take security, and the Endictment ought to be
returned there; but the certiorari is not good, for it mentions not the title
of the Act, yet the general practice of the Court seems to warrant it as it
is. The Court ordered the party to have restitution, and the contempt to be
spared by consent of parties if cause not shown to the contrary before the end
of the Term.

which the Plaintiff has declared, and the Defendant has emparled, and after
emparlance he pleads that the lands are ancient demean, Plea.

for it goes in bar of the Action it self, and not, in abatement of the Writ.

The King and Holland.
Hill. 23 Car. Banc. Reg.
ROll Justice said, Opinion of the Court for restitution in this Court and not
in Chancery. Judgment. Restitution.
that in this case formerly argued, restitution ought to be given to the party,
for the same Judgment shall be given here which should be given in Chancery,
and all the Record is here before us, and they in Chancery cannot do any thing
in the cause, for they have nothing before them. And it appears to us that the
Declaration was insufficient, and so we cannot give Judgment for the
Plaintiff; but against him, notwithstanding the inquisition found for the King.
Therefore let the party have restitution, except cause showed the first Friday
in the next Term.

THe Court was moved to discharge a prisoner brought to the Bar, For discharge

exceptions were taken to the retorn. 1. There is no time expressed how long the
party shall stand committed, Commitment.
so he is committed without limitation of time, which is not legal. 2ly. He is
committed by the name of Mr. Smith, and his name of baptism is omitted, which
ought not to be. Upon these exceptions the Court held the commitment illegal,
and discharged the party.

Upon the retorn of a certiorari to remove orders made by Commissioners of

It was moved that the retorn was not good, because it was not made by the
parties to whom the certiorari was directed, for it was directed to the
Commissioners, and the retorn is made by the Clark of the Sewers. But the Court
said the retorn was good enough, for all the retorns are so, and the Clark is
an officer of whom the Law takes notice of, and it belongs to him to do it.

Pasc. ^4 Car. Banc. Reg.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in an inferior court
in an Action upon the case, Error to reverse a Judgment in an inferior court
in an Action upon the case. Retorn. Day in court.
and the Error assigned was that the habeas corpus was not well returned, for
it is not returned to be in omnibus servitum et executum as it ought to be, and
as the usual form is. Maynard of Council against the Writ of Error argued, that
it was well returned notwithstanding those words were omitted, because the Jury
did appear full, and no issues were lost, and the Jury have day by the roll, 3
H. 7. 14. per Hussy, and 9 E. 4. 14. it is made a question but not resolved.
2ly. Though it be a Sisp yet it is within the Statute of 21. Iac. and is helped
by it, for that Statute extends to more than Writs, as may appear by the
Statute, and the Statute of 18 Eliz. Bill. Original writ. rec^ipt.
touching original Writs extends to faults of bills, although original Writs
are only named, for a bill is the same in substance with a Writ, so here the
Writ, and precept are of the same substance. 3ly. it is the intent of the
Statute, and the Statute shall be taken by equity, Hill. 13. Iac. in this Court
in Gregory and Brooks case, this question was stirred but not resolved, and
Hobart denies the 5th. report f. 61. to be Law, and there is no proceedings
properly in superior Courts by plaint. Roll Justice, The Statute extends not
to point of equity in inferior Courts, for their proceedings are not so
regular, as the proceedings in the high Courts here at Westminster, but they
are by short notes. Bring us books and move it again.

Creswell against Ventryes.

Thou did, and do receive thief stolen goods, witness a feather bed tick

they were stolen. The Plaintiff has a verdict, the Defendant moves in arrest
of Judgment that the words are not actioanble, for one may receive stolen
goods, and yet not be guilty of Felony. Becon Justice, The receiving of stolen
goods is not felony; but the receiving, and comforting of the Felon is Felony.

The Judgment was stayed till the other should move.

Thynn against Thynn.

THynn brings an Action against Thynn to reverse a Judgment given in the Common
pleas in a writ of Dowr; Error to reverse a Judgment in Dowr
Hales of Council with the Defendant in the Writ of Dowr in answer to the
exceptions formerly taken said, that the summons was well enough returned as it

satisfied, and the mischef intended to be satisfied by the Statute, Hob. 173.
Allen and Walkers Case. Demand.
For the 2d. exception to the Demand he held it good enough, for in a Writ of
Dower a Demand needs not to be so particular as in other Writs, so is it in
an Assise, 11 E. 3. 18. 43 E. 3. 6. 3 Ed. 2. Dower, 161. and the reason is,
because the Wife demands not the whole Land, nor can have the Charters which
concern the Land to enable her to make so precise a Demand as may be in other
Writs. And as to Harpers Case that is objected, I answer, it agrees not with
our Case, Regist. f. 36. 16 E. 3. Fitzh. Quar. Imp. 147. and it is certain
enough, because it is of a Rectory, and not of Tithes in gross. 3ly. The demand
of Tithes is surplusage, and it is all one as to say, the Rectory cum
pertinentiis. Then as to the Objection that one thing is twice demanded, I
answer, it is not so, ^^a^ement. Damages.
but demanded as part of a thing demanded in the Writ, and a Demand in a Writ
of Dower shall not abate the Writ, though one thing be twice demanded, for
damages shall not be twice recovered, 4 E. 3. f. 52. Mich. 9 Iac. in the
Common Pleas agreed so by the whole Court; In Bluers Case, 8 Car. one thing was
twice demanded, and yet the Writ was not abated. To the 3d. exception, That the
Demand is more large than the Writ, because a Parish may be larger than a vill,
and the Demand is the Parish of Imber; I answer, That the Vill and Parish shall
be intended to be of the same extent, if the contrary do not appear, Cooks lit.
f. 125. 2ly. Although the Parish may be larger than the Vill, yet it may lie in
the Vill, and the contrary does not here appear, and the Case is so, that it is
impossible that the Parish should extend into another Vill, 1. The office of
the Writ is to restrain the Demand, and the Writ ascertains the Demand, 19 E.
3. Fitz. Dower, 95. 9 E. 4. f. 16. by Chock. 2ly. There is a restriction within
the body of the Demand, for the Demand refers to the Writ, and is bounded by
it, 42 Eliz. Wook and Godins Case, a small implication will make a Vill and
Parish to be all one, Implication.
and so it is here, 42, 43 Eliz. Com. Banc. Hob. 12. Case Brook and Spencer,
Trin. 16 Iac. in this Court, rot. 504. Marks and Marks. And as to the Exception
taken to the execution, Execution.
that damages are given for more than is demanded, 1. Here is no confession as
it is supposed on the other side, that the Hundred in demand does lie in
another Vill. 2ly. It is impossible for damages to be given for more of the
Hundred than lies within the Vills mentioned in the Writ, and so are there no
damages given for that part of the Hundred which lies in Sutton parva, as is
objected on the other side: for no more shall be recovered than is contained in
the Writ, 9 E. 4. ^, 16, 17. The Question there was, whether it were a Plea to
the Writ, 17 E. 3. f. 44. The Court desired to hear another Argument.

Castle against Dinely.
Pasc. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. 23 Car. rot. 1078.
CAstle brings a Writ of Error to reverse a Judgment given against him in the
Court at Owse-bridge in York, Error to reverse a Judgment in an action upon the
Case.
in an Action upon the Case upon an Assumpsit; The Error assigned was, that the
day of the Month in which the promise was made is in Figures, To this the
Council on the other side said, that heretofore it had been held to be Error,
Error.
but now since the Statute of Ieofailes after a verdict is no Error. But I.
Turner of Council with the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error said, That it is a
material exception now: for the Assumpsit is the ground of the Action, and
therefore the day must needs be material. Another exception was, that the
Venire was Venire facias duodecem, etc. de Riliva tua, and the Venu was in the
City of York. But to this exception it was answered, that the Record is de
Civitate Eborum in Baliva tua, and so it is well enough: and of this opinion
was the Court. But the Court held the first Exception to be good; Whereupon the
Council for the Defendant in the Writ of Error prayed, the Judgment might be
reversed for his Clyents dispatch, and so it was.

The King against Andrews.
Pasc. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
ANdrews was endicted for Murder, and outlawed upon the Endictment,
Arraignment upon an Outlawry for Murder.
and taken upon the Out lawry, and brought to the Bar, and demanded what he
could say, why Judgment should not be given against him; The Prisoner said, he
had brought his Writ of Error to reverse the Outlawry, and prayed it might be
allowed, which was granted, and the Writ read by Broughton the Secondary on the
Crown-side. The Prisoner desired he might have Walker, Hales, and Pepes,
assigned him for his Council, which the Court granted. The Council prayed they
might have a Copy of the Record. Roll Justice said, that the Prisoner himself
ought to show matter in Law for Error, which the Council doubted. Error.
But the Court overruled it, yet agreed, that the Record should be read unto
them, which was done; Upon the reading Walker took these exceptions. 1. The
Process is not well awarded, for the Capias is not praedict. Andrews, and so it
appears not who was outlawed, whether the Prisoner or another of the same
name. 2ly. It is not said, that the Process is awarded by the Court, nor at
what Sessions it was awarded. Roll Justice, It is necessary, for it is recorded
there. 3ly. It appears not what party is dead, whether he that was struck or
another. 4ly. It does not appear in what part of the body the Wound was given,
nor with what weapon. The Court said, that they will hear the Kings Council
before they would conclude any thing. The Council moved, that the Prisoner
might be bayled, because it was fourteen years ago since he was endicted. The
Court answered, till you are assigned of Council upon Record, we cannot bayl
him at your prayer. Bayl.
Then the Council desired a Copy of the Record, ad quod non suit responsum, but
the Court said to the Council take more time to consider of other Exceptions,
for if these shall be overruled your Clyent is gone, viz. must be hanged. At
another day he was bayled by four persons, and bound to prosecute his Writ of
Error with effect.

Pasc. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
AN Action of Debt was brought upon an Obligation for 3000 l. Arrest of
Judgment in Debt upon an obligation.
the Defendant pleads that he had paid the money on such a day, whereas the
truth of the Case was, that there was two days of payment limited in the
Obligation, and the Defendant had paid part of the moneys upon one of the days
of payment, and the rest upon the other day, and not all at one day. The
Plaintiff replies that the Defendant did not pay the money upon the day alleged
by the Defendant in his Plea, and upon this an Issue is joined, and a verdict
found for the Plaintiff; Verdict.
the Defendant moves in arrest of Judgment, and shows for cause, That the
Verdict is imperfect, because it does not find that the Defendant had two days
of payment, but concludes that he did not pay the money upon one of the days.
Roll Justice, If you have two days of payment to plead, and you rely upon one
day in your pleading, Champerty.
and issue is joined upon that, and it be found against you, you must be barred
by it. Hales urged, That here was a champertous agreement, for there was no
consideration for the assignment of this Obligation and Indenture to the
Plaintiff, upon which the Action is brought by him. The Judgment was stayed
till the other part should move.

More against Stone.
Pasc. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
AN Action of Trespass of Assault and Battery, was brought by the Plaintiff for
assaulting and beating, and taking his Servant for two Months, Arrest of
Judgment in Trespass by Assault and Battery, and taking away his Servant.
Retainer.
per quod servitium amisit; The Defendant pleads not guilty, and thereupon is
an Issue joined, and a verdict for the Plaintiff. The Defendant moves in an
arrest of Judgment, and for cause shows, that the Plaintiff has not set forth
how the party was his Servant, whether as an Apprentise, or by retainer, as he
ought to have done. But the Court said, that the Record imiplies that he was
his Servant at the time when the Trespass was done, and that is enough, and
this is the usual form of declaring in this Action in the Common Pleas, and in
this Court also (and so many of the Council at the Bar affirmed) and therefore
let the Plaintiff take his Judgment.

The King against Holland.
Pasc. 24 Car, Banc. Reg.
HAles offered to the Court these reasons why Judgment should not be given
here in this Case between the King and Holland formerly spoken to. To stay
Judgment upon a Memorandum of a Record out of the Chancery. Judgment.
1. That the Record is not here in this Court, but only an extract of the
Record out of the Record which is in Chancery, and therefore judgment cannot
be given here: for a judgment must be given upon the Record it self. 2ly. It
would be inconvenient if it should be otherwise, for the Chancery is Judge of
the Inquisition, and so there may be judgment one way in Chancery, and another
way here, if the Record be not removed hither. And there is difference where a
transcript of a Record is removed out of a Court which cannot proceed upon the
Record it self, and where it is a transcript of a Record, Transcript.
upon which Record the Court may proceed, as it is in our Case, 39 H. 6. 6. 14
E. 4. 1. and 7. 3ly. It appears not to this Court how the Commission and
Inquisition are executed, whether well or not, and therefore it cannot judge of
it. Maynard on the other side prays, that judgment may be given here, upon
the memorandum of the Record sent hither out of the Chancery for these reasons,
1. Every Court ought to give judgment on the one side or other; therefore if
the King may have judgment here, the party may also have judgment. 2ly. The
Record is here in this Court virtually by sending of the Memorandum of it
hither, and that is enough to give Judgment upon. 3ly. The Chancery and this
Court as to the giving of judgment here, are as it were one Court, 24 E. 3. f.
77. 4ly. There is a ground for judgment to be given here, and it cannot be
given elsewhere, for an Award in Chancery is no Judgment, Award.
and so there cannot be two several Judgments, one in Chancery, and another
here, as Hales supposes; and in Lathams case, the Record was removed as it is
here, and Judgment given upon it in this Court. 5ly. The Chancery is not to be
Judge: for the Tranverse was there, and the cause removed hither, and we cannot
go back thither again: for if we should do so, we should have Judgment in no
Court; If it had been upon a Demurrer in Chancery, then there might have been a
Judgment there, but not now the Cause is removed by Traverse, and a Patent
shall not be corrected by the Enrolment, but the Enrollment by the Patent under
Seal. Hales on the other side said, That it is the Record of the plea that is
transmitted out of the Chancery hither, but not the Record of the Inquisition
or Commission upon which it is found, and how then can there be any Judgment?
Roll Justice said, That the Amoveas manum is but a consequence of the
judgment, Amoveas manum.
and not the Judgment it self, and we may give Judgment without the
Inquisition against the King, And the Record is transmitted hither to determine
whether the King or the party has right, and the Chancery cannot intermeddle:
for by this means the Courts will clash, which would be inconvenient. Bacon
Justice spoke to the same effect. Roll Justice added this, If an Office be
found to entitle the King in the Chancery, and it be transmitted hither, and it
appears to this Court that the office is not good, shall not we give Judgment
against the King? certainly we shall. But the Court would advise, and desired
to hear the Kings Council what they could say for the King.

Pasc. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
AN Action of Trespass was brought for taking away diverse parcels of Household
stuff, and upon non Culp pleaded, the Plaintiff had a verdict, Arrest of
Judgment in Trespass for taking away Goods.
The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, and showed for cause, that the
Declaration was not good, because diverse words in it were insensible, as 1. The
Plaintiff declares, for taking away unum Lenat, Anglice, a Mat, whereas Lenat
is no word in any Language to signify any thing, and therefore the Anglice
cannot help it. To this the Court answered, That it is all one as if it were
left out of the Declaration, because it signifies nothing in it, Damages.
and so there is no damages given for that thing which it should signify.
2ly. He declares for taking away tria suspendia, Anglice, Pot-hooks, or Hakes,
But the Court held this good enough. 3ly. He declares for taking away unum
Adustum ferreum, which are two Adjectives and signify nothing. To this the
Court said, if they signify nothing, then no damages are given for it, and
therefore let the Plaintiff take his Judgment.

Pasc. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Upon reading of the retorn of Colonel Tichborne Leiutenant of the Tower of
London upon an habeas corpus directed to him, For an alias habeas corpus with
pain.
on the behalf of John Lilborn committed by order of both houses of Parliament
for his contempt to them, Cook of Council with the Prisoner moved for an Alias
habeas corpus with a pain, because the Lieutenant had only returned the Writ;
Alia.
but not brought the body of the Prisoner. Bacon Justice, If there be
sufficient matter expressed in the retorn to detein the Prisoner, to what
purpose should we grant an Alias, Retorn.
therefore if the retorn be insufficient, move your matter against it. But Roll
Justice said, the Lieutenant ought to make his retorn either against the
jurisdiction of this Court, or else he must bring the body of the Prisoner
hither, and it is in our power to set a fine upon him, Fine.
for making an insufficient retorn. Therefore the Court ordered that he should
amend his retorn, or else they would grant an Alias with a pain.

Hocker against Lamb.
24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. 23 ar. rot. 1592.
HOcker brought a Writ of Error in this Court against Lamb to reverse a
Judgment given against him, Error to reverse a Judgment for error in the
venire. Licu c^nus. Hundred. Ward.
in the Court at Colchester in Essex; and assigns for Error, 1. That the venire
is awarded larger than the Declaration. To this Roll Justice said, the Ward
within Colchester mentioned in the Declaration is but a lieu conus; but in
London the Ward is in the nature of a Hundred, and so differs from this Case; a
second exception was, that the time of the Assumpsit, upon which the Action in
which the Judgment was given was founded is expressed in figures, viz. the
time for the delivery of the goods promised to be delivered, as also the time
of the request for the delivery of them, as also the costs, and damages
adjudged. Upon these exceptions the Court ordered the Judgment to be reversed
except very good cause should be shown to the contrary.

But Roll Justice answered, if the retorn be touching Felony, though it be
insufficient we cannot discharge the parties. The Court thereupon was moved,

that they might be bailed, which was granted, and they were bailed by four in

AN Action of Debt was brought upon an obligation with condition to stand to an
award; the Defendant pleads nullum arbitrium; Argument upon a special verdict
in debt upon on obligation to stand to an award. Recital. Conclusion.
the Plaintiff sets forth the award, and assigns a breach, and upon that an
issue is joined, and a special verdict is found, and upon the special verdict 2
questions was, whether a misrecital of the date of one of the obligations of
submission by the Arbitrators in their award, shall avoid the award. Philips of
Council with the Plaintiff argued that it should not, because that now the
parties are concluded by the plea, and the verdict found upon it. 2ly. Whether
the Arbitrators have exceeded the submission; he held they had not; for the
first point he said, 1. That the submission was the submission of the parties,
and the mistaking of the Arbitrators of the time when it was made is not
material, nor shall hurt it, for the bond of submission is not in the custody
of the Arbitrators, and so they might easily mistake the date, because they had
it not to vlew, Plow. Com. 79. Crokers case, 2ly. Date.
The date of the obligation is not an essential part of the obligation, for an
obligation may be good though it have no date, and therefore the mistaking of
the date is not much material; 3ly. There is sufficient certainty of the bond
expressed in the award, though the date be mistaken, and a void additional
description of it shall not avoid a good description of it set forth in the
award. Doughtyes case Cook 3. rep. and Dyer 292. 4ly. The misrecital is not in
words affirmative; but merely in words relative. 5ly. The clause of misrecital
refers to the deed recited by the prout, which is certain enough, and the law
rejects the miscrecital as a thing impertinent, 6. rep. 36. Dyer 116. For the
second point, although the submission should be void, yet by the issue joined
the submission is confessed, and it is now contrary to the submission to plead
null award, Dyer 32. 28, 29 H. 8. 2. rep. 4. and the parties in our case do
differ only whether there be an award or not, and not whether there be a
submission or no. And as touching the award it self, I hold that the submission
is not exceeded, Award.
for all matters in diffrence between the parties are submitted; but not the
bonds of the submission. 2ly. It stall not be taken to be alleged expressly of
the matters only submitted, and not of others, if the contrary do not appear
either by the Plaintiffs allegation or doubt of the Jury. 3ly. All the award is
performed before the discharge of the obligations of submission. 4ly. The award
is at least good in part, and it being not performed in this part that is good,
the obligation is forfeited, Cook 10. rep. Kel. 43. 45 Hob. page 267. N^bys
case, and so prays Judgment for the Plaintiff. Latch for the Desendant. 1.
The verdict is not contrary to the issue, nor admission in pleading, nor out of
the issue, but within it, for the issue is whether the award be good modo et
forma, and the submission is an essential part of the Award, and ought to be
alleged in the Award, otherwise the Award is not good, and it is here alleged
in the issue also Dyer 216. 9 H. 7. 3 and the negative here implies nothing.
Another question is, whether the Jury have found the Award set forth in the
replication, or whether they have found any Award at all, ad if any Award be
found, it is such an Award which is not in issue in the replication, and so the
verdict is for the Defendant. And as to the Award it self, I hold it void, for
the parties have not submitted to the Award that is made, for there is no
submission to the determination of matters arising between the time of the
sealing of one Bond, and of the other Bond, and so the Arbitrators have
exceeded the submission, for they have awarded to make releases at the sealing
of the last Bond, which compriseth all the time between the sealing of one
Bond, and of the other. Next, part of the Award is not good by exceeding the
submission, and this makes all the Award naught, for all the parts of this
Award do so depend one upon another, that if one be naught all is naught. And
the last part of the Award is naught, and so the Award is made but on the one
part (which cannot be good,) for if the release be not made, all Actions
between the parties cannot cease according to the Award, and so the Award is
not final; And there is no verdict here for the Plaintiff, although the verdict
should not be for the Defendant, for it appears not whether the 15th. of April
be before or after Easter, and so prays Judgment for the Defendant. Roll
Justice said, if there appears a material variance between the Award ^et forth,
Notice.
and the Award pleaded, it is ill: And it is a question whether we be bound to
take notice of the Almanac, and the feast days there set down or no. It was
adjourned to be argued again the next Term.

Thynn against Thynn.
Pasc. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
IN this Case wherein exceptions were formerly taken to the Writ of Error,
Opinion of the Court concerning a retorn.
and argued, Bacon Justice said, he had read over the book, and doubted whether
many of the Errors formerly assigned are not out of dore^, because the
certiorari is not well returned before us, for the certiorari is directed to
the Recorder, and it is returned by the Deputy Recorder in his own name. Retorn.
Roll Justice doubted also, for he said, all the old presidents were against
this retorn. But if the Writ be directed to a Recorder, who is custosbrevium,
or to a Recorder, and his Deputy, then the retorn as it is will be good.

TWisden of Council with the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error in the Wiltshire
cause took these exceptions. The first exception take was, Error and exceptions
offered to a Judgment in Dowr.
that he demand of Dowr, is larger than the original Writ, for that the demand
is of the Parish of Timesbury, and the Writ is of the Vill of Timesbury, which
is not so large by intendment as a parish, because there may be diverse Vills in
one parish; and he said, that in some case a Writ shall restrain a demand; in
other cases it shall not, namely where they cannot stand together, and so is it
here, 21 E. 4. f. 24. 3 E. 3. f. 56. Demand.
A second exception was, that the nature of the tithes demanded are not set
forth, although they be not in gross, but appendant as they ought to be, Dowr.
and a feme was not dowable at all of tithes before the Statute of 32 H. 8. and
a feme is dowable of Common appendant, but not of Common in gross. A third
exception was, that Dowr is recovered of a thing not dowable, viz. of a quarry
of stones, for if she should be dowable of a quarry of stones, this would be to
the destruction of the inheritance, and indeed it is impossible, for a quarry
of stones cannot be divided by metes and bounds, which must be if she should be
endowed of it. And also if the mine, and quarry should be divided, the Tenant
of the Land would be prejudiced; and that a quarry cannot be divided, see Cooks
Lit. 164. and so was it adjudged 2 Iac. upon a reference to the Judges. Next,
there is also Error in fact, for the Hundred of Warminster extends into the
Hundred of Sutton parva, Error in fact
and so if she be endowed of the Hundred of Warminster, she will be endowed of
the third part of two Hundreds, which is more than she demands by her Writ of
Dowr. Maynard of Council with the Defendant in the Writ of Error said, as to
the summons he held there is a good summons, and cited Hob. 137 Dalt. f. 86.
And there may be diverse parishes in one Vill, as well as diverse Vills in one
parish; And to the exception that the demand of the Dowr in the Writ is
general, whereas it ought to be a special demand; he answered, the demand in
Dowr differs from other demands, and is more favored in Law; for as Dowr it
self is favored in Law, so are the proceedings in Law to recover it, 6 E. 3.

And that the parish should extend out of the Vill, is a foreign intendment, and
shall not be so taken against an Averment, and when a Vill, and a parish are
named by one name, one of them shall not be intended larger than the other, if
the contrary be not shown. Long quint. Ed. 4. f. 20. And he argued that a feme
is dowable of a quarry, and that it may be divided by metes and bounds, for it
may be divided by the profits, although it cannot be divided by the quantity of
the thing. Roll Justice said, By no manner of pleading can one abate a Writ
after Judgment, and how should it be so here? And 2 Cases were cited by the
Council that bis petita shall not abate a Writ. Mich. 9. Iac. Bolstrod and

upon the Case, and not an Action of Trespass quare vi and armis. But Roll
Justice answered, that he might have an Action upon the Case, or a Trespass vi
and armis at his election, Election of Action.
and therefore the exception is null. Another exception was taken, that there
was 4 years between the time of the Trespass done, and the time of bringing the
Action. Roll Justice answered, you should have pleaded this matter if you would
have had advantage by it, but it is to no purpose to urge it. Another exception
was taken, that the Declaration says that he took him in his possession out of
his possession. But the Court overruled this also, and ordered the Defendant
to show better matter why Judgment should not be given against him.

TWisden upon a rule of Court to show cause why there should not be a new

said, that two things were alleged on the other side that there ought to be a
new Trial. 1. That two of the Jurors were of kin to the Plaintiff. And 2ly.
That there was notice given to the Defendant of a second Venire facias. To the
first of which he answered, that the Jurors were not of kin, and produced an
Affidavit for proof. Roll Justice interrupted him, and said, it is not now
material whether they be of kin or no, for the Defendant should have taken
advantage of that upon his challenge at the Trial. Challenge. Advantage.
And for the second, it matters not whether he gave notice of the second Venire
or no: for the rules of the Court do not enjoin him to give notice. Maynard of
Council with the Defendant urged, that two of the Jurors were of kin, and
produces an Affidavit to prove it, and said, that the Defendant was also
surprised for want of notice of the second Venire. Roll Justice said, the
second Venire ought to be entered here, and if it were not entered, how can the
Defendant know whether it be altered or no? Yet here is no breach of the rules
of the Court, and so the proceedings are fair: for the Venire may be entered,
Entry.
or it may not be entered, and if it be not entered, the party may go to the
Attorney, and procure a Copy of it before the Trial: and though the Venire be
not entered till after the Assizes, it is well enough. Therefore let the
Plaintiff take his Judgment.

Argument in Dower. Demand.
and held, 1. That the nature of the Tithes demanded in the Writ of Dower ought
to have been expressed, for the demand may peradventure be of such Tithes,
whereof the Feme is not dowable. 2ly. Where the thing it self is demanded of
which the Sheriff is to give possession, there the Demand of it ought to be
certain: for as it is in a Demand in an Ejectione firmae, or an Assise, so
ought it to be in a Demand in a Writ of Dower, Dyer, f. 116. and 258. 11 Rep.

that is where there is not a special form of Writ. 2ly a Chapel is not conveyed

that damages of the value of the Tithes are not to be given in Dower; next
the Inquisition does not find, that the Husband dyed seized of the Tithes, and
then there can be no Judgment given for them. And the dying seized of the
Rectory, is no dying seized of the Tithes, nor is the dying seized of the
Chapel, a dying seized of the Tithes appurtenant to it, for the Chapel is but

Latch urged, that the administration was not yet settled: for it was granted
upon Condition, and if the Administrator will not bring in an inventory, the
Ordinary may alter the administration. Hales on the other side prays, there may
be a general Prohibition cuiliber, etc. Roll Justice, The Prohibition must be
against some certain person; but if diverse have appeared to sue, there a
Prohibition shall be against all of them, and the Jurisdiction of the Court
cannot be enlarged by the agreement of the parties, Revocation.

IN arrest of Judgment it was urged, Arrest of Judgment in Trespass.
that the Declaration was uncertain; for the Plaintiff had declared pro quinque

Pewter-dishes; for it might be Spoons, Pots, or any other sort of Pewter as
well as Dishes. But the Council on the other side said, Anglice void.
it was well enough, and prayed for Judgment. Roll Justice said, the Anglice
shall be void, and then the Latin is good, for it is five pieces of Pewter, and
it matters not what pieces they be: For it is ad valentiam, which makes the
value certain enough to the Jury. Therefore let the Plaintiff take his
Judgment.

against Buckminster, and sets forth that the condition of the Obligation was
to this effect, That whereas Heart had carried so many thousand of Billets and
delivered them at Dartford in Kent, for the use of Buckminster, amounting at so
much by the thousand, to a hundred pound in the whole, if therefore the
Defendant should pay the said hundred pound at such a time and place, that then
the Obligation to be void, or else to be in force; and for non-payment was the
Action brought. The Defendant says that the Plaintiff did not carry and
deliver so many thousand of Billets to Dartford (as the Plaintiff had declared,
and demands Judgment of the Action. The Plaintiff by way of replication
demands Judgment if the Defendant shall be admitted to pleadt his Plea, which
is contrary to the averment of the Obligation, which is his own Deed, and shall
not be estopped thereby. Estople.
To this the Defendant demurs. And the Court held that this recital in the
Obligation is an Estople to the Defendant to plead the contrary; and the rule
was, for him to show cause why Judgment should not be given against him upon
his Demurrer.

and has a verdict The Defendant moves in arrest of Judgment, and shows that
the Declaration was too general and uncertain: for it is for such a quantity of
Grain, and does not set forth what sort of Grain, and so it may be for Grain
not titheable. Maynard of Council with the Plaintiff held, that in this Case
the Declaration was well enough, although it would not have been so in an
Action of trespass, for that Action requires more certainty. A 2d. Exception
was, that it is not said whether the Corn was in Garbs or Sheaves. To this
Maynard said, it is well enough notwithstanding, for it shall be intended only
of such Grain as is usually put in Garbs. Hales of Council with the Defendant
said, the word Grain was too general a word to be used, Incertainty.
and no certainty in it, for it extends to Mustard Seed, Cole-seed, Rape-seed,
etc. and the genus ought to be expressed, and it shall not be intended of Corn
put in Garbs. The Court would advise, but inclined the Declaration was too

the Plaintiff was charged with in the Endictment, and so there could never have
been any Judgment given against him. Maynard on the other side said, it was
well expressed, and could not well be otherwise expressed than it is. Bacon

But Roll Justice answered, that it was, that the Desendant was indebted tunc

Court. Jurisdiction. Assumpsit.
and the being indebted there is an Assumpsit in Law, that he will pay the

Upon a rule of Court for a reference to the Secondary, Whether a contempt to

whether the party, and the Sheriff were in contempt to the Court for taking
out of Execution, and executing it after a Writ of Error brought upon a
Judgment, it was moved that he might make his report, who thereupon reported to
this effect; That there was a writ of Error brought upon the Judgment before
Execution taken forth; Notice.
but there was no notice thereof given to the party, nor any supersedeas taken
forth to stay Execution, and therefore the Plaintiff might take out Execution,

notwithstanding the writ of Error brought, and that thereby he is not in
contempt to the Court. Roll Justice said, Then is the Execution now well
executd, Execution.
and the Sherif is in no fault. Maynard of Council with the Plaintiff in the
writ of Error, moved that the Execution was awarded improvide, and therefore
the Court may restore the party to his goods taken in Execution, although the
Sherif be not in fault. Roll Justice, The party ought to take notice of a
recipitur upon the Record if it be entered, and if the party take out Execution
after the writ of Error is allowed, he is in contempt to the Court, else not,
and the Attorney is not bound to view the Record whether a writ of Error be
brought; but may take out Execution if there be not a Supersedeas, Supersedeas;
or notice given to the party. Therefore there is no help here, for the
proceedings have been according to the course of the Court, for by the delivery
of the writ of Error to the Officer of the Court, the hands of the Court are
closed. Yet let us see the President that Wood ward has to show, and let the
Secondary examine it again.

at the day before the Auditors assigned, and secondly it was moved that the
Court would assign a day peremptory, Certifica^e. Auditors.
for the party to appear before the Auditors. But Roll Justice said, a day
cannot be assigned until a certificate be made to us from the Auditors, for
they are trusted, and are Judges of the cause, and have power to excuse the
nonappearance of the party at the day, if they see cause, and to give longer

Hill. 23 Car. rot. 1493.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment in an Action upon the Case
brought by an Administrator in the Court at Esham; Error to reverse a Judgment
in an action upon the case.
The Errors assigned were. 1. The Plaintiff does not declare that the
administration was granted unto him per loci illius ordinarium. 2ly. The
Plaintiff says in his Declaration, producit litteras Administratorias
intestati, whereas it should be ordinarii, and not intestati. 3ly. The Court
cannot by its privilege being an inferior Court, Capias.
and that but newly erected, award a Capias upon entering the plaint, as it is
here done. 4ly. The Court began first to be a Court, but 9 Iac. and yet it is
said to be held per usum et consuetudinem curiae. Twisden to the 1. exception
said, that it is helped by the verdict. Roll Justice asked how does it appear
that Esham is within the Diocese of the Bishop that granted the Letters of
Administration, for if it be not, the Letters are not well granted; And said,
that in a Declaration it is not necessary to say that Letters of Administration
are granted per loci illius ordinarium, aut cui pertinuit, Administration
Declaration, Plea.
although they ought to be so pleaded in a plea in Bar. To the second
exception, Twisden answered, that the words mentioned are not necessary, and
the Declaration would be good enough without them, and therefore they shall not
hurt it, though they he mistaken, and if it should be otherwise, yet they are
helped by the verdict; and to the first exception he said, that the words
secundum usum et consuetudinem shall be intended to be meant according to the
Law, and not according to ancient usage, as is urged by the Council on the
other side. The rule was that Judgment be affirmed except better matter should
be shown Monday next.

and has a verdict. The Defendant moves in arrest of Judgment, and shows that
there was an amendment in the consideration, and the promise after the issue
joined. Twisden answered, it is not material, though it be so, for the matter
of the Assumpsit is employed, and the words altered are idle, and cited 37 ^l.
Heydons Case, for it is de et super praemissis, Amercement.
which implies all the matter. Roll Justice said, that the words de et super
praemissis go not to the time, but to the matter submitted, and said that the
words postea, scilicet eodem die, Contract in law. special contract
upon a contract in Law shall be intended the time of the contract, but here is
a special contract and collateral, and it ought to be otherwise intended, and
desired to see a book.

Freeborn against Purchase.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hill. 23 Car. rot. 1575.
FReeborn brought an Action upon the Case against Purchase, Demurrer to a
Declaration in an action upon the case.
and declares that the Defendant in consideration that the Plaintiff had paid
unto him such a sum of money, did assume, and promise to joy in the surrender
of certain Copyhold Lands, and that for not performing this promise he brings
his Action. The Defendant demurs upon the Declaration, Request.
and shows that the Plaintiff does not allege that he made any request to the
Defendant to join in the surrender, which he ought to do, for it was not a
single Act to be done by the Defendant alone; but he was to join in the Act
with another. Roll Justice said, the promise is that the Defendant shall join
in the surrender, Breach.
and he does not say that he did request him to join, which he should have
done. And besides the breach is not well assigned, for you have assigned a
particular way how he should surrender, namely into the hands of 2 Tenants of
the manor, whereas he did assume only to join in a surrender, which may be in
Court, or into the hands of the Lord, as well as into the hands of two Tenants;
so is Syms and Walkers Case, 9 Car. Also the Plaintiff ought to have showed
that there is such a particular custom in the manor, Notice.
that a Copyhold Tenant may surrender into the hands of two Tenants of the
manor, or else such a Custom cannot be taken notice of. Therefore let a nil
capiat per billam be entered against the Plaintiff.

Wright against Martin.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court was moved to change the venue in an Action for an escape, To change
a venue in an action for an escape. Local.
upon an affidavit that the escape touching which the Action was brought was in
another County, and not in the County where the Action was brought. But Roll
Justice said, that an escape in one place is an escape all England over, and is
not local; therefore the venue is not to be tied to one place more than
another. Yet let the other party show cause why the venue should not be altered.

Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Upon a rule to show cause why Judgment should not be stayed in an Action upon
the Statute of 2 Ed. 6. for not setting forth of Tithes, Exceptions answered
offered in arrest of Judgment in an action upon the Statute of 2 Ed. 6. for
not setting forth of tithes. Recital,
these exceptions for merly taken were answered. 1. It was said the Statute was
misrecited, for the day when the Parliament began wherein the Statute was made
is mistaken; but to this it is answered, that the Declaration does not say per
Statutum in Parliamento inchoat. tali die, but in Parliament. tento tali die,
and the Parliament was held by prorogation the day that it is mentioned, though
it were not then first begun, and so that is well enough. To the second
exception, that the Declaration does say that the Plaintiff was primo die
occupator ac postea eodem die, etc. So that it appears not, Proprietor.
that he was proprietor, and so the Action may not lie, for he may be occupator
wrongfully, and so not proprietor. It is answered, that the Declaration is,
that he was tali die possessionatus et ab eodem die occupavit, and this shall
be judged of a rightful estate, and it is said, that he is rector ecclesiae,
and so he shall be intended proprietor of the Tithes, if the contrary be not
shown. The rule was to show better cause Friday following, else Judgment for
the Plaintiff.

Sowthcott against Sowthcott.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg,
IN this Case formerly moved, Exceptions answered taken to arrest judgment in
an action for tithes. Tithes.
and Judgment stayed til the Plaintiff should move: Maynard for the Plaintiff
moved for Judgment, and to the exception taken on the other side, that the
word grain used in the Declaration is too general, and may extend to grain not
titheable, viz. to rape-seed and cole-seed, etc. as well as to titheable, and
so the Declaration is uncertain; De said it is well enough, for it is said
grain growing in such a field by name, which makes it certain, 2 rep. lib. Int.
176. 2d. Coment. f. 161. b. and for the word grain in common understanding it is
meant for corn, and not for seeds, though in a large exception it may extend to
seeds also. Hales on the otherside said, that the word grain is uncertain, and
signifies more than corn, and also the word Garbae is too general, for it may
extend to more than sheafs of Corn, for bundles of any thing bound up may be
said to be Garbae, as well as Corn bound in sheafs, and may extend also to
grain not titheable. Roll Justice held, the words in the Declaration, Seminavit
cum grano proper enough, Common intent
and that by common construction it shall be meant with Corn, and not with
seeds, 10 Car. Goldsmiths Case, Hill. rot. 8. And for Garbae, it is also well
enough, for it shall be taken according to common construction, which is to
signify corn bound up, and shall not be taken in the large extent of the word
for bundles of any thing else. And the Jury has taken notice of it, for they
have found debet, which had they not they could not have found the verdict so.
The rule was for the Plaintiff to take his Judgment, if cause were not shown
Friday following.

The King and Sr. Henry Spiller
Trin. 24 Car. ^anc. Reg.
THe Court was moved for the quashing of diverse Endictments wherein Sr. Henry
Spiller was endicted for not repairing a bridge; For quashing diverse
Endictments for ^or repairing of a Bridge.
the exception to the first was, that it does not set forth in what County the
bridge lies, and for that exception it was quashed. Another Endictment was for
not repairing of Mays Bridge, and it does not show that the bridge is in the
Highway. But to this Roll Justice said, that the Endictment does say it is a
Common bridge, and that is enough, and it is needless to say it is in the
Highway. Another exception was taken to this Endictment; that it did not show
whether the bridge were a cart bridge, or a horse bridge, or a foot bridge, or
what other passage was over it, and for that exception that Endictment was
quashed. To a third Endictment for not repairing the same bridge, this
exception was taken, viz. It says that Sr. Henry Spillar was bound to repair
the bridge ratione manerii, which cannot be good; but it should be rationae
tenurae manerii. Roll Justice said, It ought to show that he is owner of the
manor, and although it do express that he is bound to repair it ratione
manerii sui, that is but implication that he is to repair it, Implication.
and makes it not appear that he is possessed of the manor, and upon this
exception was this Endictment quashed. Addition.
To a fourth Endictment for not repairing the same bridge, this exception was
taken, that there is no addition of the County, where Sr. Henry Spillar dwelt,
as the Statute directs, and for this it was also quashed. Yet afterward
because there was no certificate that the bridge was repaired, the Court would
quash none of them, but said, let him plead to them: The Defendants Council
moved that he might plead but to two of them, and that process might be spared
to the rest. Roll Justice, Appear to all, and plead, and proceed in two of
them, and process shall be stayed to the rest.

Burrel and Lancaster.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
BUrrell brought an Action of Trespass quare clausum fregit against Lancaster,
Arrest of Judgment in Trespass quare clausum fregit. Variance. Nomen
aggregativum.
and had a verdict; the Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, and for cause
shows that there is a variance between the writ, and the Declaration, for the
writ is quare clausum fregit in the singular number, and the Plaintiff declares
of diverse Closes; But Roll Justice said, That it was well enough, for the word
clausum is nomen aggregativum, and may contain many Closes, and so may well
enough agree with the Declaration, And therefore let the Plhintiff take his
Judgment.

Glide against Dudeney.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Pasc. 24 Car. rot. 426.
GLide brings an ejectione firmae against Dudeney in the Common pleas, Error
upon a Judgment in an ejectione firmae in the Common plea
and has a Judgment by default against the Defendant, whereupon a writ of
enquiry issues out to enquire of the Damages, and before the retorn thereof,
the Defendant brings a writ of Error, the question was, whether the writ of
Error were well brought, in regard that the course of the Common pleas is not
to make up the Judgment until the writ of enquiry be returned. Roll Justice
said, that a writ of Error may be brought before the writ of enquiry be
returned in an ejectione firmae, for in that Action the Judgment is complete
at the Common Law before it be returned, Judgment. Error.
for the Judgment is but to gain possession, and so is it in a writ of Dower;
but in an Action of Trespass where damages only are to be recovered, there the
Judgment is not perfect till the writ of enquiry is returned, nor can be made
up before as in this case it may, but in regard that here is no complete
Judgment entered, for there is no capias which ought to be in all Actions quare
vi et armis, that the King may have his fine which else he cannot have if the
party do not proceed in his Writ of Enquiry, Error. Execution.
the Writ of Error is brought too soon, and you may proceed to execution in the
Common Pleas, for the complete Record is not here. Therefore advise what to do
in the Common Pleas, for it is mischievous qua cunque via.

Norton against
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
NOrton brought an Action of Assault and Battery against the Defendant, Arrest
of Judgment in Assault and Battery. Mis-sworn.
and had a verdict against him. The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment,
that in the Venire facias one of the Jurors was returned by the name of Edmund,
and it appears by the Postea, that he was sworn by the name of Edward, which
cannot be intended to be the same person. Roll I^stice said* Amendment.
if the Clerk of the Assizes, in returning of the Postea have mistaken the
name, it may be amended here in Court by his notes, by which he made the
Postea; and therefore let him be examined here whether it be a mistake or no.

Toby against Angel.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc Reg.
THe Court was moved for a reference in this Cause to the Secondary, because
the suit was commenced upon two Counter-bonds, For a reference.
which are both cancelled. Roll Justice answered, then why should it be
referred: for you may plead non damnificatus, if the truth of the matter be so:
but the party may peradventure be damnified, notwithstanding the Bonds be
cancelled, and may have good cause of Action.

Langly against Wybord.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
LAngly brought an Action of Debt upon an Obligation to stand to an Award
against Wybord. Demurrer to a Replication in Debt upon an Obligation to stand
to an Award. Award.
The Defendant pleads nullum Arbitrium. The Plaintiff replies, that the
Arbitrators did make an Award, and sets it forth in haec verba; The Defendant
demurs and shows for cause, that the Award is not well set forth: for he does
not show, that the Award was delivered up by the Arbitrators, according to the
submission. Roll Justice answered, it was well enough, though it be not. A
second cause was, that it is not said touching what suits the Award was made.
Roll Justice answered, the Award is said to be de praemissis, and that is good
enough. 3ly. The Award is, that all suits shall cease. Roll Justice, This is
well enough. 4ly. The Arbitrators have exceeded their submission. The rule was
to bring the Roll into Court, and till then the former rule to stand.
Afterward the Award was judged good, and the Plaintiff had his Judgment.

Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in an Inferior
Court, Error to reverse a judgment in an Inferior Court.
and the Error assigned was, That the plaint was entered before such an one
Maio^ and the suit was continued before another Mayor, and it is not shown that
the first Mayor was removed, and that the other Mayor was lawfully elected and
sworn. Roll Justice said, that the Continuances in Inferior Courts ought to
show the manner of the Continuances, Continuance.
and it ought not to be expressed generally. And it is not said tunc majori,
Trial.
which would have made it more uncertain. I doubt the Venire facias is
discontinued, and then there is no Trial; therefore it is good to advise.

Pragnell against Goff.
24 Car. Banc. Reg.
GOff brings an Action upon an Assumpsit against Pragnell, Error upon a
Judgment in an Action upon an Assumpsit.
and has a verdict, and a Judgment against him. The Defendant brings a Writ
of Error to reverse this Judgment. The Case was this, Pragnell did assume and
promise unto Goff, that in consideration that Goff would mary the Daughter of
Pragnell, that he would be bound to give over his Shop unto him, and not use
his Trade in Basingstoke, and would lend unto him fifty pound, and for not
performing this promise he had his Judgment. The Error assigned was, that
there is a breach said of all the promise, Assumpsit.
which consists of diverse parts, and one part of it is against Law, namely, the
Promise to be bound not to use his Trade, and yet damages are given entirely
for all, which is not good. Wild on Council on the other side said, that in 2
H. 5. urged is no Judgment given, and in our Case it is not that he shall be
bound not to use his Trade generally, but only in the Town of Basingstoke, and
he may use it any where else, and therefore it is not against Law. Roll
Justice, If the words be general, that he shall not use his Trade in such a
place without any consideration, this is ill: but it is otherwise if there be a
consideration, for a man may sell his Liberty and Privilege for a
Consideration, and it shall bind him. The rule was to show cause Saturday next
why Judgment should not be affirmed. This was afterward moved and objected,
Damages.
that part of the Assumpsit was to turn over the Defendants Trade, and damages
given for that which is impossible. Roll Justice said, if damages entire be
given for some things with others whereof some are impossible, the damages
shall be deemed to be given for those that are possible, and void to the rest,
The Judgment was affirmed.

Peeling against Ken.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Pasc. 24 Car. rot. 89.
PEeling brought an Action of Debt upon an Obligation to stand to an Award
against Ken. The Defendant pleads Nullum Arbitrium. Demurrer to a Replication
in Debt upon on obligation to stand to an award.
The Plaintiff replies and sets forth the Award in haee verba, and assigns a
breach. The Defendant demurs to the Replication, and the Plaintiff joins in the
Demurrer. The causes assigned for the Demurer were, 1. To the Award it self,
Award.
which is that whereas it appears that there was six pound and a shilling due
by the Plaintiff unto the Defendant; the Arbitrators had awarded, that the
Plaintiff should pay unto the Defendant six pound in full satisfaction thereof:
which is less than they acknowledge to be due, so that it cannot be a
satisfaction, 9 H. 7. f. 11. 46 E. 3. f. 7. 2ly. The Award is, that one of the
parties shall deliver Dimissionem praedictam, whereas it ought to be Indenturam
dimissionis; for the dimission is but the consent of the party to the
Indenture, and not the Indenture it self, Cooks Instit. 43 6. 3ly. They award
to deliver dimissionem praedictam in the House of a Stranger, which ought not
to be: for the party must commit a trespass to do it, if he cannot get leave of
the Stranger, which he is not bound to do, 9 H. 7. 16. 18 Ed. 3. 23 19 Ed. 4.
41. The words are, that it shall be delivered at the House, and in and at are
all one in grammatical construction, Mich. 23 Car. Coleman and Painters Case.
4ly. They award one of the parties shall release three years rent to the other,
and there was but two years rent due, so that it is impossible to be done. 5ly.
They have made their Award upon a thing not submitted, viz. that there should
be a release of all Actions which might concern the rent; Averment.
and lastly, the party ought to show he has performed the Award on his part,
which he has not not done, 8 H. 6. 18. Brook Arbitrament. Twisden of Council
on the other side, to the first Exception said, it is not to the purpose: for
Arbitrators may award a less sum than is due, in satisfaction of it, and
though it be ill, yet the Award is good as to so much, whereof a good breach is
assigned. To the second he answered, that the words dimissionem praedictam
refer to the Indenture pleaded, and so that is well enough. To the third he
said, that the Award is that the Indenture shall be delivered at the House, and
it is lawful for him to go to the House, though not into the House of a
Stranger. The the 4th. he answered, that the words are to be understood that
the party shall not pay the rent, and not that he shall release it. To the fifth
he said, that the words alleged are no part of the Arbitrament. And if the
Obligation be released it is not material, for the Arbitrament is performed,
and the words Premises restrain the Arbitrament to the Submission. And to the
sixth it is not necessary to show how the Arbitrament is performed: for if it
be not, the other party has his remedy. Roll Justice said, that in 12 Iac. it
was adjudged, that if an Arbitrament was for a thing to be done in or at the
House of a Stranger, it was well enough: for it may be intended to be done at
the House without doing a Trespass, though not in the House, except the
contrary be showed by the party. In Lynyn and Williamson, Hoofs Case; and as
to the words dimissionem praedictam, that is also well enough: for it shall be
intended the Indenture of demise. But let us have Books and move it again. It
was moved again, and another exception taken, that the promise was released;
Upon which the Court would advise.

Smith against Hobson.
Trin. 23 Car. rot. 1078.
SMith an Inn Keeper in Warwick brought an Action upon the Case against
Hobson, Arrest of Judgment in an action upon the Case.
for speaking these words, Colonel Egerton had the French pox, and has set it
in the House (meaning the Plaintiffs House) and William Smith and his wife
(meaning the Plaintiff and his Wife) have it, and all you. The Plaintiff has a
verdict. The Defendant moves in arrest of Judgment, and for cause shows, that
the words are not actionable: for the words are, that Colonel Egerton has set
the French pox in the House, which is impossible: for the House could not have
the pox, and the words William Smith and his Wife have it, shall not be meant
that they have the pox, but the House, for that is the next Antecedent to the
words, to which they shall refer. And also where words are spoken doubtfully
whether they be spoken true or false, they shall be taken to be true: and it
may be here the words are true, and then no Action lies for speaking of them:
also the Baron and Feme ought to join in the Action, if they be actionable,
Ioyn in Action.
for they are spoken to both their prejudice, and the Action is not to be
brought by the Husband alone, as here it is. Also in this Case the words being
spoken of a House, the Writ of Enquiry of Damages must be what Damages is
come to the House, which cannot be. Roll Justice, If an Action be brought for
words, and part of them be actionable, and part are not, yet an Action lies for
them which are actionable. And in this Case the Husband alone may bring the
Action for damages to himself, and he may afterward bring another Action for
the damages done to his Wife. And he held the words here actionable, and bid
the Plaintiff take his Judgment, if cause were not shown to the contrary
Saturday following. Judgment was afterward given accordingly.

Marshall against Porter.
Hill. 23 Car. rot. 769.
MArshall brings an Action of Trespass Quare vi and armis for taking away his
Cattle. Demurrer to a special plea in Trespass. Quare vi and armis.
The Defendant pleads non Cul. as to the vi and armis, and as to the taking of
the Cattle he pleads, that he bought them in a Market-overt. The Plaintiff
demurs to this Plea, and the Defendant joins in the Demurrer. The Exception
taken to the Plea was, that the Defendant does not show what day the Market was
kept, nor whether it were out of Lent, according to the Patent for the keeping
of the Market. Roll Justice said, this ought to have been averred in the Plea,
and therefore the Plea is not good. Averment.
Therefore let the Plaintiff have his Judgment if cause be not shown to the
contrary.

Pitcher against Symons.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hill. 23 Car. rot. 189.
SYmons brought an Action upon the Case upon an Assumpsit in the Compleas
against Pitcher, and has a verdict, and a Judgment. Error to reverse a
Judgment in an action upon an Assumpsit. Issue. Amendment.
The Defendant brought a Writ of Error here to reverse the Judgment. The Error
assigned was, that there was no issue joined between the parties to the suit:
for it is and praedictus Josephus similiter, whereas it should be praedictus
Robertus. Roll Justice cited 9 Eliz. Dyer, and said, if it be praedictus
Richardus where it ought to be Robertus, it cannot be amended, because the
Issue is altered: for it is joined between other parties, and so is it in this
Case. But move it again Friday next.

Deacon against Forest.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
DEacon brings an Action in this Court against Forest. Whether a Plea was
peremptory, or that there might be a Respondes ouster. Peremptory. Plea.
The Defendant appears in Michaelmas Term, and impar^s to Hillary Term, and
before the day of Continuance pleads a Plea in abatement; to which the
Plaintiff demurs. Yard of Council with the Plaintiff said, he conceived the
Plea was peremptory to the Defendant, because it comes after an imparlance, and
a Continuance, and so comes in lieu of a Peremptory: for the Law admits but one
delay, and therefore the Defendant should have pleaded in Chief, and not having
done it, his Plea shall be as if it were a Plea in Chief overruled, and cited
Long Quit. E. 4. f. 139. Roll Justice, You cite not the Book as it is, here is
but a Plea in Abatement, and the Continuance makes it not peremptory, 2 Ed. 4.
f. 10. A second Exception was, that the Plaintiff has not demurred upon the
Plea, but pleaded to issue, and here is a departure from the general issue,
Departure.
34 H. 6. f. 8, 9. Roll Justice, The Book is against you, for upon a Demurrer a
Plea dilatory is not peremptory: but upon an issue joined it is. Yard, The
delay of the Demurrer makes it peremptory, 22 H. 6. f. 55. Roll Justice, The
Book cited is against you, and in 50 E. 3. f. 20. Difference.
There is a difference taken between the delay of the Court, and the delay of
the party; and here is no delay in the party, for he might have been forced by
the rules of the Court to hasten the proceedings, and the Book of 34 H. 6. is
against you. The Plea in Abatement ought not to have been received after
imparlance, but if it be received, and a Demurrer upon it, it cannot be helped
and if one plead a Plea after imparlance, Plea.
which ought not to be pleaded, the Plaintiff may pray the Court to overruled
it: but if he demur upon it, he admits that the Plea may be; and one may plead
a Plea in Bar by way of abatement, and e contra. Therefore let the Defendant
plead in Chief, if cause be not showed on Friday to the contrary.

Burges against Dynham.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hill. 23 Car. rot. 1191.
BUrges brought an Action of Trespass against Dynham for taking 24 load of
Timber. Demurrer upon a Plea of Justification.
The Defendant justifies, that he took the Timber as a Deputy of a Purve your
to the King, for the reparations of the Mansion houses of the King. To this
Plea of Justification, the Plaintiff demurs, and for cause shows, that it
does not appear, that the Defendant has any authority by the Common Law, or by
Statute to take this Timber: for the Commission which gives this authority
ought to be renewed every sir Months, Commission.
and it does not appear that it was so in this Case, 2 Institut. f. 545. 10 E.
4. 2, 3. 2ly. He has not showed that the Houses were in decay when he took the
Timber, and he cannot take it to make a Common stock, to repair them afterward
when they should fall to decay. Purveyours.
3ly. Purveyours ought to pay ready money for the commodities they take, and he
does not show in our Case that he paid ready money for the Timber, by the Stat.
36 Ed. 3. C. 2. 47 Ed. 3. f. 8. but by 22 Ed. 3. Tit. Bar. 259. it seems to be
otherwise: but the Case there differs from this Case, for there it was that a
Purveyour may take Horses to use for a time, without paying money: but it was
not to alter the property. 4ly. He has not showed that he endeavored to agree
with the Plaintiff for his Timber, as he ought to have done. Plea.
Hill. 2 Car. rot. 509. Parker and Sturgens case. 5ly. The plea is hudled up,
and is not pleaded particularly and distinctly as it ought to be, so that the
Plaintiff knows not how to take an issue, 10 H. 7. The rule of Court was to
bear the other side Friday next.

Brereton and Monington.
Trin 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in an inferior
Court, and the Error assigned was, Error to reverse a judgment given in an
infetiour court. Plaint, Amendment.
that the Plaint was entered against Francis, and the proceedings were against
John. Roll Justice said, that it was not good, for a Plaint is in the nature of
an original writ, and therefore if that be erroneous it cannot be helped though
it be after a verdict. And therefore show cause Saturday next why the Judgment
should not be reversed.

Gallop against Symson.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
CHase brings an Action of Trover and Conversion against Gallop, Error to
reverse a judgment in a trover and conversion.
and his wife, and a stranger, in the Common pleas, and has a verdict, and a
Judgment against them. The Defendant brings a writ of Error to reverse this
Judgment, and assigns for Error that the Plaintiff declares that the goods for
which the Action is brought, venerunt ad usum ipsorum, viz. of the Husband, and
his wife, and the stranger, which cannot be, Declaration.
for they cannot be said to come to the use of a Feme covert. Roll Justice,
This is not good, for he ought not to declare that the goods came to the use of
the Feme, but to the use of the Husband only. And therefore reversetur
judicium, except cause shown to the contrary Saturday next.

Wainewright and VVhitly.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
VVAinewright brought an Action upon the Case against Whitly, Arrest of
judgment in an action upon the case.
for these words spoken of him; Thou art a thief, and have broke my Chest; The
Plaintiff has a verdict, The Defendant in arrest of Judgment moves that the
words are not actionable. But Roll Justice said, notwithstanding my Lord
Hobarts opinion, he held the words are actionable, for the word and is
cumulative, and aggravates the former words, Cumulative, Explanatory.
are not barely explanatory, and the subsequent words are violent, and may very
well stand with the former. Therefore let the Plaintiff take his Judgment.

The King and Camel.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc Reg.
ANn Camel endicted at Southwold in Suffolk for Felony and Witchcraft was
brought to the Bar by an habeas corpus, An arraignment for witchcraft.
and was here arraigned. The prisoner desired Walker for her Council. Roll
Justice asked her for what cause and matter she did desire Council; To which
the prisoner making no answer, Roll Justice viewed the Endictment, and upon
that assigned her Walker for her Council, and gave him the next day to show his
exceptions against the Endictment, at which time Walker desired that the
Endictment might be read, which was done, and upon the reading of it he took
these exceptions. 1. To the caption wherein it is expressed, that the
Endictment was taken in pena cessione, Endictment.
where it should be in plena cessione. To this Roll answered, if the word pena
be left out, the Endictment is good enough without it, and therefore passes
ouster. A second exception was, that the Endictment does not say that the
Justices before whom it was taken were justiciarii ad pacem tenendam in villa
praedicta, and then they might have no power to find the Endictment; but this
exception was also overruled by the Court. A third exception was, That the
Endictment is too general, for it only says that the prisoner practicavit
diabolias arts, and does not express what. To this Roll Justice answered,
that the employing of wicked spirits to any intent whatsoever is Felony within
the Statute, Felony.
and the intent why they were employed is well expressed in the Endictment, and
if an Endictment fail in one part, it may be good in another: and therefore the
Endictment is good, and the prisoner must plead; Whereupon the prisoner pleaded
not guilty. Upon this Walker moved the Court that this was an old Endictment,
and that the prisoner had been twice acquitted upon other Endictments of the
same nature, and that this was prosecuted for malice, and prayed that the
prisoner might be bailed, which was granted. And she was bailed by her Husband,
and by one Zachary Baggs a sufficient Citizen and Fishmonger of London, and two
others, to appear at the next Assizes to be held for the County of Suffolk.

Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg
THe Court was moved to quash an Endictment exhibited upon the Statute of
perjury at Kingston upon Thames for these exceptions. To quash an Endictment
upon the Statute of perjury.
1. It is not expressed in what County Kingston is; and 2ly. the Endictment
does not express how the party is perjured, for it shows not in what cause it
was nor that it was in giving any evidence upon oath as a witness in any
cause. Upon these exceptions the Endictment was quashed. Nota

the Defendant brings a writ of Error to reverse this Judgment, and assigns
for Error, 1. That the Declaration does not show in what Parish within the City
the Trespass was done, as he ought. To this Roll Justice answered. That it
shall not be intended that there are more Parishes within the City than one,
Intention.
except the contrary be showed. 2ly. The Declaration est quod cum talis, viz.
the Defendant, etc. which is not an express averment, Declaration. Trespass.
that the Defendant did the Trespass; but it is set forth only by way of
circumstance that he did it, which is not good, for he ought to be charged
directly with it. Roll Justice, The setting forth the Trespass by a Quod cum
is not good, tho gh in another Action it may be good. Therefore let the
Judgment be reversed, except cause shown to the contrary Saturday next.

Walker and Alder:
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg:
ALder had a Judgment and an Execution against Walker, Auditaquereld for one
taken twice upon one execution
and thereupon he was taken, and in custody in the Kings Bench prison. Alder
the Plaintiff afterward consented that the Defendant Walker should come to him
out of prison to the Horshoe Tavern, which was out of the Rule, without a
Keeper or rule of Court, thinking to make some agreement with him. The
Defendant accordingly went thither, but because no agreement could be made, The
Plaintiff takes the Defendant again upon the same Execution, and lays him
again in the Kings Bench, Audita querela. Discharge.
the Defendant thereupon brings his audita querela; And adjudged by the Court
to be well brought for the Execution was discharged by the Prisoners going at

Reader against Palmer.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
REader brought an Action upon the Case against Palmer, Arrest of Judgment in
action upon the case for altering the Declaratio
and has a verdict, the Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment that the
Plaintiff altered his Declaration in the consideration of the promise, and in
the promise it self, after he had pleaded, so that thereby the same issue which
is tried, is not that which was joined. Twisden of Council with the Plaintiff
said, that the issue was not altered, for the words altered are not material
words. Wild of Council with the Defendant said, the issue was altered by
alteration of the words, for the Action is brought upon a special promise, and
not upon a promise in Law, as the altering of the words have made the promise
to be, and therefore it is a material alteration. Roll Justice said, it is a
material thing that is altered, and it ought not to be amended; An Actual
promise, and a consideration continuing, Amendment.

reputation, etc. The Defendant spoke these words of her, viz. she is a common
Whore, and I will prove her one, by reason whereof she lost her credit and
reputation, and her marriage. The Defendant pleaded that she was not of an
honest reputation at the time when he spoke these words of her, as is alleged
in the Declaration: The Plaintiff demurs generally to this plea. Judgment was
given for the Plaintiff, except cause should be showed Saturday next to the
contrary. Antea

Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
MY Lord Moon had a Suit commenced against him in this Court, For a
supersedeas for a Peer of the Realm. Supersedeas. Privilege.
and thereupon he moves by his Council upon an affidavit that he was a Peer of
the Realm, and a Lord of the Parliament, and therefore ought not to be sued,
and prays for a supersedeas to stay the proceedings. Roll Justice, Plead your
privilege, for upon an affidavit we will make no rule, or else acquaint the
other party that he is a Peer of the Realm, and it is like he will forbear to
proceed thereupon. But you ought not to trouble the Court with such motions as
these.

Cornish against Cowsye.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. 23 Car. rot. 1434.
COrnish brought an Action of Debt against Cowsye an Executor, Special verdict
in Debt for rent against an Executor.
for arrerages of rent incurred, part in the life of the Testator, and part in
the time of the Executor. The Plaintiff declares upon a lease made by him to
the Testator by his Indenture made the first of May in such a year, etc. The
Defendant pleads nil debet, and upon this a special verdict was sound to this
effect, That the Plaintiff did upon the first day of May, make the Indenture of
lease to the Testator of the lands let, to have and to hold a die datus, for
and during the term of 7 years, from our Lady day last past, from henceforth
fully to be complete and ended, upon this verdict, the question insisted upon
by the Council was, whether there be not such a variance between the lease,
upon which the Plaintiff has declared, and the lease found in the verdict,
Variance.
that they shall be said to be several leases, or whether it shall be adjudged
one and the same lease. Twisden for the Defendant held that there is such a
variance between the lease in the Declaration, and the lease, found in the
verdict, that they cannot be the same, and so the Plaintiff can have no
Judgment, and he urged this ground of Law that a deed shall be so construed
that all parts of it may be made to stand together if it be possible without
forced construction of the words; but this cannot be here, and a Lessor may
make a lease to begin when he pleases, and end when he pleases,
notwithstanding the date of it, and a lease made to begin at a day past, does
begin in interest in present, Lease for years.
though not in computation, and he cited Musgraves case, Hob. rep. where two
computations are in a lease for years, and one is repugnant to the other, the
last shall be rejected. Hales of Council with the Plaintiff held, that the
lease begins in point of interest from the day of the date, and that there is
no variance, or repugnancy between the lease mentioned in the Declaration, and
the lease found in the verdict, and therefore the verdict is for the Plaintiff.
Roll Justice said, it would be hard for him to maintain it, and said,
Presumption.
that in presumption of Law, when a thing is to be done upon one day, all that
day is allowed to do it in for the avoiding of fractions in time, Fraction.
which the Law admits not of, but in case of necessity, Hill. 14 Jac. More and
Musgrave Mich. 10 Iac. rot. 76 in the Exchequer. A Demise the 5 of May, by
Indenture dated the 4 of May, habendum from the feast of the Annunciation last

presents. But there are other points in the Case at the Bar to be considered
of, for the Action of Debt is for rent, part incurred in time of the Testator,
Detinet.
and part in time of the Executor, and it is in the detinet, which ought not to
have been; but I conceive that that is here helped by the verdict, yet it is
worth consideration: VVaiver.
And he said, that an Executor cannot waive a Term if he have not assets, but
if he have he may. Another thing here considerable is, that the Action is
brought in the detinet, and the Defendant pleads nil debet; Yet he said, that
after a verdict it might be good enough, for it is a Debt though the Action be
brought in the detinet, Trin. 10 Car. 1289. Porter and Iarvis Banc. Reg. and he
said that the Plaintiff has mistaken his lease, yet I will advise by reason of
the opinion in Musgraves case, Hob. rep. Lease. Livery and Seisin.
It is a lease in computation of time, from the sealing, and according to the
habendum a livery and seisin habendum a die datus delivered the next day is
good, if it be made by the party; but it is questioned whether it be so, if it
be made by an Attorney. An ancient deed which cannot be proved, shall be
intended to be delivered the last hour of the day, to make good the conveyance.
But I will take a little time to advise.

Raw against Raw.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
RAw had a judgment in an Action of Debt brought for arrerages upon an account
in Newcastle upon Tyne against Raw, Error to reverse a Judgment in Debt upon
arrerages of an account. Venire.
the Defendant brought a Writ of Error to reverse this Judgment, and assigned
for Error, 1. In the issuing out of the venire, it is not said to be per
Majorem praedictum villae praedictae; but per Majorem generally. 2ly. It is
said, ad re co cognoscendum instead of recognoscendum. 3ly. It is said the Jury
assidunt damna de praedict. who is not named before, for it is assidunt damna
ipsius Katharinae Carr, whereas she was before called Katharine Raw, and so
damages are given to no certain person, for they have different names. Roll
Justice said, the surname Carr is void, Damages.
and it shall be taken as if it had been said ipsius Katharinae only, and that
is good enough. But examine the transscript by the Record, whether the word be
re co cognoscendum or not, for if it be so, it is not good.

Lovell against Knatchford.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Pasc. 24 Car. rot. 348.
KNatchford had a Judgment in the Common Pleas against Lovell. Error to
reverse a Judgment for Error in the Postea. Commission.
The Defendant brings a Writ of Error to reverse this Judgment. The Error
assigned was in the Postea, in that it is not said that the Justice of Assise
Associato sibi, etc. as it ought to be by the Statute. Roll Justice said, the
Justice of Assise may have a special Commission to go the Circuit alone, and
then it must not be said so, but if it be per formam Statuti, it ought to be
associato sibi, etc. But the Clark of the Assise may bring in his notes by
which he made the Postea, and amend it by them: for it is his fault to make the
Retorn so. Amendment.

AN Action of Debt was brought upon an Obligation to stand to an Award;
Plaintiff moves to discontinue his action. Discontinuance.
The Plaintiff showed to the Court, that the Award made was not under hand and
seal, according to the submission, and therefore he had no cause of Action, and
prayed that he might discontinue his Action. Roll Justice answered, it is in an
Award, and I will do nothing in if; but if it were upon a Debt, it might be the
Debt remains, though the Award be ill, but Judgment is not demanded. I will do
nothing in it.

Newton against Bales.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Pasc. 24 Car. rot. 183. or 178.
BAles had a Judgment against Newton, Error to reverse a Judgment in an Act
on on the Case.
in an Action upon the Case upon an Assumpsit in the Court at Owse-bridge in
York. The Defendant brings a Writ of Error to reverse this Judgment, and
assigns these Errors, 1. It is said, the Defendant was to deliver certain
commodities ad ratum, instead of secundum ratum. But to this Roll Justice said,
that ad ratum and secundum ratum are all one in signification. 2ly. There is no
time set forth when the promise was made, for it is set down in figures, which
is all one as if it were not set down at all. Roll Justice, The Record is not
so, though the transcript be, Amendment.
therefore that may be amended. 3ly. There are two several promises, and they
are both alleged. Roll Justice, Its well enough. 4ly. The Venire is not
returned, for it is not returned to be in omnibus servitum and executum. Retorn.
To this the Council on the other side answered, it appears that there is a
panell returned, and therefore it is well enough, though those words be
omitted. Roll Justice, The panel is not returned, nor annexed according the
Statute, and therefore it is no return in Law. Therefore let the Judgment be
reversed for this cause, except cause showed to the contrary.

Watson against Scotson.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Upon a suit between Scotson and Watson in the Court of Admiralty, To
discontinue an action, and to discharge the Bayl. Discharge.
Scotson entered into an Obligation to Watson. Watson brings an Action of Debt
upon this Obligation in this Court against Scotson. Scotson appears, and puts
in bayl to the Action, and after moves the Court, that Watson may be ordered to
proceed in the Admiralty upon this Obligation, in regard the Bond was given
there, and that the bayl here may be discharged. Roll Justice, I will not
release the bayl: for it is filed, and it is a Record here, Bayl.
and it is not unduly done.

Aylet against Oats.
Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Pasc. 24 Car. rot. 397.
A Judgment was given in the Common Pleas in an Action of Assault and Battery
against three. Error to reverse a judgment in Assault and Battery.
The Defendants brings a Writ of Error to reverse this Judgment, and assigned
for Error, that the Action was brought against three, and that they all
appeared by Attorney, and pleaded, whereas one of them was an Infant within age,
and ought to have pleaded by his Guardian, and that Judgment was entirely
given against them all, which must be void against the Infant, and so it being
entire is void also to the two other Defendants. Wild of Council with the
Defendant in the Writ of Error argued, that the Judgment may be reversed in
part, Judgment.
viz as to the Infant, and yet may stand good against the other Defendants: for
the Action might have been brought against them severally as well as jointly,
35 H. 6. f. 21. 5 Ed. 4. f. 7. Roll Justice said, it is ruled contrary. Where a
Judgment is reversed for an error in Law against some of the Defendants, it is
reversed against all of them: but it seems to be otherwise where it is reversed
for an Error in Fact, 35 H. 6. 2. Hales on the other side moved to reverse the
Judgment wholly; Discontinuance.
for it is an entire Judgment and cannot be reversed in part only: for all the
Defendants are equally concerned in it, and a discontinuance against one of
them reverses the Judgment against all of them, and he denied the Book of 5
Ed. 4. Error.
and cited 29 Ed. 3. f. 39. Roll Justice said, if it be a Judgment at the
Common Law, or a Judgment where costs are given by the Statute, if it be
reversed as to one, it is reversed to all. And here is an entire judgment
given by the Common Law, and it cannot be helped. But bring me the Book. Postea.

firmae. Error to reverse a Judgment in an Eject. firmae.
The Defendant brought a Writ of Error to reverse the Judgment, and assigned
the general Error. The Plaintiff in the Judgment prayed it might be affirmed.
Roll Justice demanded of him, if it be a Judgment upon a Nihil dicit how can
it be of this Term? Therefore give notice and move again. Judgment.
But the Judgment is, ideo consideratum est quod recuperet, and there wants
and defendens capiatur, and therefore the Judgment is erroneous, and how can
it then be affirmed? 3 Car. in the Exchequer. Mich. 5 Iac. rot. 269. Allens

Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
IN an Action of Debt brought upon the Statute of 2 Ed. 6. for not setting
forth of Tithes, Arrest of Judgment in Debt upon the Stat. of 2 Ed. 6. for not
setting forth of Tithes. Copy.
after a verdict, It was moved in arrest of Judgment, that the Statute was not
well recited: for the Parliament began in the first year of Ed. 6. and was
prorogued, and the Act was made the 26th of November, and not the fourth, as it
is set forth to be. For proof of this a Copy of the Parliament-roll, and an
Affidavit to prove the Copy to be true were read in the Court. Hales of Council
on the other side said, that the Copy was taken out of the
Parliament-Iournal-book only and not out of the Writ for prorogation of the
Parliament, as it ought to be. Roll Justice said to the Council on the other
side, Advise you how to answer this, and let the Judgment stay in the mean
time. antea.

for entering into his Close, and taking away a Mare and a Bridle, in the County
of York, and had a verdict, and a Judgment against the Defendant. The
Defendant brings a Writ of Error to reverse this Judgment, and assigns for
Error, that the Court was said to be held on Saturday the ninth of November,
whereas the Saturday on which the Court was held, was not the 9th. day of
November, Error,
but the 7th. and so there is no Court alleged to be held, for on the 9th. day
there was none held, 1 H. 7. 11 E. 4. 10. Roll Justice, It should seem they did
not look well into the Almanac, if they had, this mistake had not been. Let
the Judgment be reversed, except cause be shown Monday next.

Trespass.
and a Writ of Error thereupon brought to reverse this Judgment, and the Error
assigned was, that the Venire was returned by one that was not Sheriff at the
time of the return. To this it was said by the Council on the other side, that
this matter ought not to be assigned for Error, Error.
because it is against the Record: on the other side it was inssisted upon,
that he may assign it for Error. Roll Justice said, it may be assigned for
Error, but it is a Question how it shall be tried: for it is not upon a
Demurrer, and so the matter is not before us, 11 Car. Smith and Smith. And this
cause ought not as it is to have been put into the Paper.

an action of Account. Bar.
The Defendant pleads that the Plaintiff stands convicted upon the Statute made
against Recusancy, and demands Judgment Si actio. The Plaintiff demurs upon
the Plea. Wild of Council with the Plaintiff said, that this matter ought not
to be pleaded in Bar of the Action, but he ought to conclude only Judgment if
he shall be answered. The Council on the other side desired time to speak in
it. Roll Justice, Show cause Monday next why Judgment shall not be given
against you.

Hen. 6. against forcible entries. For quashing an Endictment. County. Liberty.

THe Court was moved to quash an endictment of Perjury against Stephen Burton.
The Exceptions taken to the Endictmment were these, For quashing an Endictment

appear to be the Quarter Sessions as by the Statute it ought. 2ly. It is said,
that the Defendant dixit, etc. and does not show where or in what Plea he gave
the evidence wherein the perjury was committed. 3ly. It does not say, that the
Defendant gave the evidence corruptive, as it ought to do. 4ly. The prejudice
is not said to be ad grave damnum of any body, and so no body being prejudiced
by it, none ought to be endicted for it. Roll Justice said, it is not enough to
say the Endictment was taken in plena Cessione generally, but it must appear in
what Sessions it was. Therefore let cause be shown why it should not be
quashed. It was afterward quashed, because it did not show, that any of the
Justices before whom it was taken were of the Quorum, and not for the other
exceptions.

Pilum is used for Pileum, in English a Cap. 3. December Colores, Anglice
Neckbands. 4. Cruralia, Anglice Garters. 5. He declares de uno instrumento,
Anglice a Plate, for a Jack. And 6ly. Pro uno operimento, Anglice a Rayl. But
Roll Justice said, We must not be too curious to express all things in Latin

therefore let the Plaintiff have his Judgment.

and ill to other part.
and upon view of the Book Roll Justice held, that the Judgment was entire,

not set it forth in the Declaration, and therefore desired that he may either
have Oyer of it, or else that the Declaration being imperfect, so that he
cannot plead, and he being now in prison, may otherwise be set at large. Roll
Justice, We cannot compel the Plaintiff to set forth the condition of the
Obligation; but till he does the Defendant shall not be compelled to plead,
Plea.
and let the Plaintiff show cause upon not ice given to him, why the Defendant
shall not go at large upon Common bail. It was moved again, Common Bail.

and Feme and the stranger converterunt ad usum suum proprium. The Plaintiff had
a Verdict and Judgment. The Defendant brings a Writ of Error to reverse this
Judgment, and assigns for Error, that the Declaration is not good, for it
declares of a Conversion made by the Feme to her own use, which cannot be, she
being a Feme Covert. Roll Justice said, The Declaration does intend, that all
the Defendants did convert the goods, Declaration. Feme Covert. Conversion.
which cannot be, for the Feme cannot convert them, and cited Crow and Bakers
case 1 Caroli and 7 H. 7. f. 3. Therefore let the Judgment be reversed.

that the Order may be confirmed here, and the Constable compelled to be sworn.
Roll Justice answered, That by granting it the execution of Justice by the

this Court to compel the Constable to be sworn, which was granted. Mandamus.


Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
A Judgment was given in the Common Pleas in an ejectione firmae quod
recuperet, and writ of Enquiry taken out; Whether a Writ of Error good.
but before it was executed and returned the Defendant brought a writ of Error;
and the question was whether the writ of Error lay or no. Turner of Council
with the Defendant in the writ of Error argued, that it did not lie, because
the Original writ was not determined when the writ of Error was brought, and so
the Judgment was not perfect or complete, and consequently a writ of Error
could not be brought to reverse it, and that the writ is not determined nor the
Judgment prefect, is proved, because the Action being an ejectione firmae here
is no costs and damages found, nor is there any habere facia^ possessionem
returned, which are the fruits of the judgment, and and he cited 34 H. 8. f.
18. 39 H. 8. Fitz. Error 40. 36 and 37 Eliz. in the Common Pleas, Year and
Peverells Case, and 6 Car. Banc. Reg. But Roll Justice said, here is ideo
consideratum est quod recuperet, Judgment.
which is a perfect Judgment, but it had not been so if the Judgment had been
quod recuperare debeat, and it is in your power whether you will have a writ of
enquiry or not, and if he judgment be affirmed here upon the writ of Error
brought you may have a writ of enquiry here in this Court. Brev. d'enquiry.
The Council thereupon moved for a Certiorari. Roll Justice, Take it but it
will do you no good, for the judgment is well.

Thou art a pick pocket Rogue and have picked thy masters pocket and his

in arrest of judgment that the words are not actionable, for that they are too
general and uncertain. The Judgment was arrested till the Plaintiff should move.

A Certiorari was granted out of this Court to removed certain endictments of
forcible entries, For a Supersede^s to a Certiorari.
whereas in truth there were no Endictments of forcible entry found against the
party; upon this a Supersedeas was prayed to supersede the Certiorari. Roll
Justice, This Certiorari was gotten by way of pervention for what might be
done, Procedendo.
but take a Procedendoto the Justices to proceed notwithstanding the Certiorari.

Trin. 24. Car. Banc. Reg.
A Scire facias was taken out to revive a judgment, For the Defendant to plead
in chief after imparlance.
and to have execution: The Defendant appears and imparls, and after imparlance
pleads in abatement of the Scire facias, that the Plaintiff had taken out a
former Scire facias for the same cause, which is yet depending. It was moved
for the Plaintiff, that the Defendant ought not to plead this plea in abatement
after imparlance, but that he ought to plead in chief. Roll Justice, Let him
plead such a plea as he will abide by within a week, or else let the Plaintiff
take his judgment.

Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
A Copyholder being sued in this Court for certain lands, moved, that the
Steward of his Lords Court, For a Steward of a Court to bring in the Court
Rolls.
to whom he was a Copyholder, might be ordered to bring in the Court-Rolls into
this Court, that by them he may be the better enabled to defend his title to
the lands. But Roll Justice said, He cannot be ordered to do it by this Court,
therefore we will make no rule in it.

Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
AN Action of Debt was brought for Rent in the Common Pleas, Error to reverse a
judgment in the Common Pleas fortent. Misnosmer.
where the Plaintiff had a Verdict and a judgment, and a Writ of Error was
brought in this Court to reverse this Judgment: The Errors assigned were, 1.
There is an Indenture recited to be between the Plaintiff and John Barber,
whereas it should have been John Barker. Roll Justice answered, It may be that
he is known by the one name, and the other, and then it is well enough. A
second Exception was, It is said per indenturam signatam, and does not say
deliberatam, and then it is no deed if it be not delivered. To this Roll
Justice answered, Deed.
If he say per factum suum, it is well enough, notwithstanding, for that
implies it to be a perfect deed. 3ly. He declares for Rent of Houses in Kent
street, and does not show in what Parish Kent street is. Adjourned.

Trin. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court was moved for a habeas corpus for a Prisoner in the Kings Bench
Prison, that he might be a writnesse in a cause to be tried at the next Assizes
in Darby Shire. But Roll Justice answered, we will grant no habeas corpus, for
this is but a trick of the party himself to gain his Liberty that he may go a
hawking and hunting this long vacation. But I have known it granted for one to
be a witness at a trial at Yield Hall; but at the charges, and peril of the
Party, for whom he was to be a witness, if he escape.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Upon a motion for a habeas Corpus for one in Execution upon a sentence given
against him in the Court of the Admiralty, For a habeas corpus for one in
Execution upon a sentence in the Admiralty.
It was said by Roll Justice, That if one be sued in the Admiralty to a
sentence, and be in Execution upon it, and be brought hither by a habeas
corpus; if upon the retorn it does not appear that the Admiralty had not
jurisdiction of the cause, but it appears only that they had proceeded to a
sentence against the rules of their own Court, This Court will not deliver the
Prisoner out of Execution, Appeal.
for he ought to have made his appeal, before he was taken in Execution. And so
is it touching the proceedings in other Courts of equity.

Cage.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
ONe Cage was in Execution in the Kings Bench upon a Judgment had against him
for a hundred pound, To vacate a satisfaction acknowledged upon a Judgment.
The Plaintiffs Attorney by fraud without the consent of his Clyent
acknowledges satisfaction upon this Judgment, afterward the Attorney of the
Defendant without the consent of his Clyent acknowledges another Judgment for
the same Debt. The Plaintiffs Council moved, that the Defendant might be in
Execution upon the first Judgment, and that the satisfaction acknowledged
thereupon, might be vacated. Roll Justice answered, Commitment.
The Attorney ought to be committed for acknowledging the second Judgment
without Warrant; But here are two frauds, one of each side, so that there is
fraud against fraud, and so the parties are left to their remedyse one against
the other, but both the Attorneys shall be committed for their false practie.
And we will examine the whole truth of the matter Saturday next.

against Loveday.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court was moved upon an affidavit that one of the Jurors that gave the
verdict against the Plaintiff had a suit in law depending at that time with the
Plaintiff, and therefore that the trial was not indifferent, For a new trial
after verdict because a Iuror not indiste. rent. Challenge. Trial.
and therefore it was prayed there might be a new trial. But the Court said,
it could not be, and asked the party why he did not challenge the Iuror for
this cause at the trial, for want of which he had now lost that advantage.

Stradling and his wife against Boreman.
Mich. 24 Car. ^anc. Reg.
STradling and his wife brought an Action of Trespass of Assault and battery,
Arrest of judgment in Trespass, Ioyn in Action.
and taking of a horse, agianst Boreman, and the Plaintiffs declare ad damnum
ipsorum, and have a verdict; the Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, and
showed for cause that the Baron and Feme cannot join in this Action, but ought
to bring several Actions, for the wrong done to each was several. The
Judgment was thereupon stayed till the Plaintiff should move.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
AN Action upon the Case was brought for speaking these words, Arrest of
juogement in an action upon the Case.
He is gone and dares not show himself for Debt, and he is a Banckrupt, for
ought that I know; the Plaintiff had a verdict, the Defendant moves in attest
of Judgment that the words are not actionable, because they are general, and
uncertain. But the Court held that all the words taken together are actioanble,
but stayed the Judgment for a week.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
IVrors who appeared for a trial at the Bar which fell off for want of a full
Jury, Jurors move for their charges.
prayed the Court they might have their charges, because they came a great way,
and had attended long in town. The Court answered them, that it was their
neighbors fault, who did not appear, that the trial went not on, for both the
parties are ready, and if the cause had been tried, you should have had all
your charges. But now we can order nothing.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Upon a Retorn of a certiorari to remove an order of Sessions made against a
Parish for not repairing of a high way, Exception to an order, and fine of
Sessions.
Hales of Council for the Parish took this exception, viz. That the fine was
set upon the Parish without any process issued out against the Parish, only
upon a certificate of one of the Justices of the peace made upon his own view
that the way was not repaired, and so the Parish was condemned before they were
heard. To this the Court answered, That a Justice of Peace may make a
certificate upon his own view, Certificate.
of the want of reparations of a Highway, by the Statute. Therefore bring a
certificate that the way is repaired, else we will do nothing, for we must not
be too hasty to overthrow such presentiments which so much concern the public
good. And in this case if there be a conviction in law, Conviction. Travers.
and the fine levied, we cannot help it, and now you cannot traverse, for it is
too late.

Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper against St. John.
Mich. 4 Car. Banc. Reg.
SIr Anthony Ashley Cooper brought an Action of Trespass upon the Case for
false imprisonment of him against St. John, Arrest of Judgment in an action on
the case.
and has a verdict against him; the Defendant moves in arrest of Judgment,
and takes this Exception to the Declaration that it wanted vi et armis which
ought to have been, because this is not a mere Action upon the Case; but in its
nature it is an Action of Trespass, and therefore he ought to have been
declared in with vi et armis. Roll Justice answered, what say you to the Case,
Declaration.
quare fregit suum mill dam, which has been adjudged good without vi et armis
as, well as with vi et armis? and in one case it shall be said to be an Action
of Trespass, viz. with the vi et armis, and in the other an Action upon the
Case, viz. without the vi et armis; and Bacon Justice cited the 9. rep. The
Earl of Shrewsburyes Case. Roll Justice, It is a plain Action upon the Case, as
it may appear by reading of the Record, for it is with an et quod cum. Bacon
Justice said, one cannot have an Action of Trespass for the breaking of
another man's fence; but if he be damnifyed by the breaking of it, Tresasse. Case
he may have an Action upon the Case against the party that broke it.

Air against Sils.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Air brought an Action upon the Case against Sils, Arrest of Judgment in an
action upon an assumpsit. Case.
upon a promise to pay certain arrerages of rent appearing due unto him upon an
account made between him and the Defendant: The Plaintiff had a verdict. The
Defendant moves in Arrest of Judgment, and for cause shows, that an Action
upon the Case does not ly upon a promise to pay rent appearing due upon
account, for the rent was due by a real contract, and upon that the Plaintiff
had remedy without the promise. To this the Court said, that this Action does
not ly for rent alone due upon a real contract, but for the rent with other
things it does lie, yet let the Judgment be stayed, for there is here no new
consideration appearing to ground this promise upon but only the old
consideration of Law for the payment of the rent, and upon that an Action of
the Case does not ly, for it is in the realty.

Tomkins against Jourden.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. 24 Car. rot. 96.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in an inferior Court,
and these Errors we are assigned. Error to reverse a judgment given in an
inferior court.
1. It is said in the style of the Court that the Court was held per
consuetudinem et literas patences, which is not good, for the Court cannot be
held by both. Roll Justice, This is not good, 2ly. Against the writ of Error it
is objected by the other side, that the writ of Error is directed to one, and
is returned by another, for the certiorari was to certyfie a Judgment given
before the Mayor, Aldermen, and Recorder, and the Judgment certifyed, is a
Judgment given before the Mayor and the Aldermen, and the Recorder is left
out, so that the Record is not removed, and then the Judgment cannot be
affirmed. Roll Justice said, the pleading is confused, and Bacon Justice said,
you have changed the style of the corporation by your pleading; If a Court be
held by Custom, Custom.
and after a patent be purchased to hold it, and they hold it by the patent,
the Custom is gone; but bring us a Copy of the certificate of the style of the
Court, and in the mean time we will advise.

Pickering against Barkley.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Pasc. 24 Car. rot. 154.
PIckering brought an Action of Covenant upon a deed of Covenants of
Charter-party, Demurrer upon a plea in an action of covenant.
whereby it was Covenanted that the Defendant in consideration of a certain sum
of money agreed to be paid to the Defendant, for freight of a Ship, should make
such a voyage, and bear all losses and damage which should befall the Ship, or
Merchandises in her, excepting only perils of the Sea, and declares that the
Defendant had not performed his agreement, and for this he brings his Action.
The Defendant pleads, that in the making of his voyage upon the Sea, the Ship
was taken per quosdam ignotos homines bellicosos, whereby he was hindered in
making of the voyage according to his agreement; to this plea the Plaintiff
demurs. The question was in regard that in the Charter party perils of the
Seas were excepted, whether the taking of the Ship by these, unknown men of War
should be accounted a peril of the Sea, or not according to the meaning of
Merchants. Twisden of Council with the Plaintiff held it should not, and so the
plea was not good, and that therefore the Plaintiff ought to have Judgment, and
said, this was not a danger of the Sea, but a danger upon the Sea. 2ly. He
said, the party (it may be) might have prevented it by vigilance, or by making
resistance, and so it may be it was his own fault the Ship was taken. 3ly. The
men of War that took the Ship were peradventure English men, and then the
Defendant is not to be excused, for he may have his remedy for what he is
damnified, against them, and cited 33 H. 6. f. 1. and prayed Judgment for the
Plaintiff. Hales of Council with the Defendant held, that to be taken and
robbed by Pirates is a danger of the Sea, even as tempestuous winds, and
Shelfs, and Rocks are. And 2ly. To that it is said, the pirates may be English
men, we are not able to say of what Nation they were, and therefore our plea is
good in that point also, and prayed Judgment for the Defendant. Roll Justice
said, it was not well pleaded to say per homines ignotos. Bacon Justice said,
The Defendant does not show that he and his Ship was carried per locos
incognitos, as he should have shown; Plea.
but Roll Justice answered, that it may be the Ship is yet kept upon the Sea,
but I suppose that Pirates are perils of the Sea, and to this purpose a
certificate of Merchants was read in Court, that they were so esteemed amongst
Merchants. Yet the Court desired to have Granly the Master of the Trinity
house, and other sufficient Merchants to be brought into the Court to satisfy
the Court viva voce Friday next following. Judgment was given this Term nil
capiat per billam, because the taking by Pirates are accounted perils of the
Seas.

Wood against Clemence.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hill. 22 Car. rot. 804.
VVOod brought an Action of Debt upon an Obligation to stand to an award,
against Clemence. Demurrer upon an award pleaded.
The Defendant pleaded that the Arbitrators made no award: The Plaintiff
replies that the Vmpire made an award, and sets it forth at large. The
Defendant demurs, and for cause shows that it appears by the pleading that the
Vmpire was chosen before he ought to be; for it appears not that the
Arbitrators could not agree in making the award, or that they had any power to
make an Vmpire. 2ly. The Award is made for satisfaction to the Owners and
Mariners of the Ship, concerning which the submission was made, Award.
and one of them is the Plaintiff in this Action, and they cannot arbitrate
that the moneys which concern one shall be paid to another, and so all the
award is naught. Also here is nothing arbitrated concerning John Acton the
Master of the Ship, who is one of the parties within the submission. Roll
Justice, As to the first Exception it is not a material one, as I conceive. But
give a note of your exceptions to the Council of the other side, and bring us
Books. Postea.

Friar and others against
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
AN Action of Debt was brought for 1500 l. upon a deed of Charter-party. Arrest
of judgment in debt.
The Plaintiff had a verdict. The Defendant moved in arrest of judgment. and
offers for cause, that the Declaration was insufficient, for it appears not by
it that the Defendant is indebted to the Plaintiff, and then there is no cause
of Action; for the Declaration only says, that he is indebted, as it appears,
but shows now how. Roll Justice said, it is by indenture, and well enough. Dyer
2, 3 Phil. and Mar. f. 148. Plowden 121. 122. Debt. Covenant.
Buckleys case 143. Browning and Beestons case 21 E. 4. f. 29, he said, either
an action of debt, or an action of Covenant lies here, for it is upon a
Charter-party. Here is not indeed a perfect allegation, yet it is well enough,
for it has been usually thus pleaded. Speak to it again Wednesday next.

Dison against Bartue.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
DIson brought an action of Assault and Battery and taking of his goods, Arrest
of Judgment in Assault and Battery.
against Bartue, and had a Verdict; the Defendant moved ^^ arrest of Judgment,
and showed for cause that the Declaration was ^^^ good for it is with a quod
cum, etc. which in an action of trespass, vi et ^^mis, is not good; for it is
not a direct affirmative, that the Defendant did the Trespass; but it is only
an implication that he did it, but as it is it might have been good if the
action had been an action of Trespass upon the case. The Judgment was stayed
till the Plaintiff should move.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
AN Action of Debt was brought upon an Obligation to stand to an Award.
Demurrer upon an Award pleaded.
The Defendant pleaded nullum arbitrium. The Plaintiff replies, and sets forth
the Award, and assigns a breach; The Defendant demurs; The Plaintiff after
demurrer moves the Court, that he might discontinue his Action. But the Court
said, that after a demurrer upon an Arbitration, it is not usual to discontinue
the Action. Discontinuance.
But let nil capiat per billam be entered, if cause be not showed to the
contrary.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
AN Action of Debt was brought by Baron and Feme upon an Obligation made to the
Feme dum sola fuit, Arrest of Judgment by Baron and Feme.
and the Declaration is ad damnum ipsorum, The Plaintiffs had a verdict; The
Defendant moves in arrest of Judgment, and for cause shows, that the
Declaration should not be ad damnum ipsorum, Declaration.
but only ad damnum of the Husband only. But the Court held that the
Declaration was well enough, and said, it is the usual way of declaring in such
Actions and the money due upon the Obligation not being paid to the Feme whilst
she was sole, it was damage to her; and now being Covert it is a damage to
the Baron also, and so it is ad damnum ipsorum 16 E. 4. Therefore let the
Plaintiff take his Judgment.

Quatermans Case.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
IN the Case of one Quaterman, Ancient use of pract^c altered.
Roll Justice said, that out of indulgence to the Bayl, it has been the use of
later times, that if the Bayl do bring in the principal before the retorn of
the second Scire facias, which was taken out against the Bayl, Discharge.
thereupon to discharge the Bayl: but anciently it was not so, but it was then
counted too late to bring him in.

Hill and Harris
Micst. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
AN Action of Debt was brought against diverse Executors. Arrest of judgment in
an action of Debt against Executors.
The Defendants plead fully administered, and upon this an Issue was joined, and
a verdict found for the Plaintiff. The Defendants moved in arrest of Judgment,
that there is contrariety between the issue joined, and the verdict found: for
the Action is entire against all the Executors, and they had all pleaded fully
administered, Verdict.
and upon this the issue was joined, and the veredict finds that some of the
Executors had fully administered, and that others of them had Goods in their
hands, whereas the verdict should have been that they had not fully
administered. The Judgment was stayed till the Plaintiff should move.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Upon a rule of Court to show cause why restitution should not be granted upon
an Endictment of forcible entry, Cause why no restitution upon an endictment of
forcible entry.
exception was taken to the Endictment, that it did not say, that the party
entered illicite and manu forti, as the words of the Statute direct, and it was
said, that in a forcible entry there ought to be an entry, expulsion, and
deteyner. Roll Justice said, that there ought to be manu forti in the
Endictment, according to the Statute, to distinguish this kind of Entry from an
ordinary Trespass by entering into another Land, which is not so violent as a
forceable entry is supposed to be. But let us see the Copy of the Endictment.

Gibbs against Dunn.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
GIbbs brought an Action upon the Case against Dunn, Arrest of judgment in an
action upon the Case for words.
for these several words spoken of him by the Defendants Wife at several times,
viz. thou art a thief for stealing my corn out of my Barn, and at another time
for saying thou art a thief. The Plaintiff has a verdict; The Defendant moved
in arrest of Judgment, that entire damages were given for both the words;
whereas the first words were not actionable: Damages entire. Intendment.
for the Feme being a Feme Covert could have no Corn of her own, for it was her
Husbands Corn, and so there could be no stealing of her Corn. But the Court
answered, that in common intendment the Corn is hers and her Husbands Corn,
though in legal construction it be not so, and the Scandal is great, although
it appear that the words were spoken by a Feme covert. Therefore let the
plaintiff take his Judgment, except cause be shown to the contrary. Judgment
was given the same Term, because the last words were held to be accumulative.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Clark of the Errors in the Common Pleas attended here upon a rule of this
Court, Clark of Court ought ^o^ to move the Court.
Whereupon one of the Clarks of the Court gave notice of it to the Court, and
prayed he might be heard. But the Court answered, that Council ought to move
it, and not be.

The King against Doctor Trigg.
THe Court was moved for Doctor Trigg to estreate the Fine into the Exchequer
which was set upon him by the Court upon his conviction upon an informaiton
preferred against him upon the Statute for practicing Physic in London,
without a license from the College of Physicians. For the estreating of a Fine.
Hales of Council with the College of Physicians moves it may not be estreated,
for it is not necessary, and here the Judgment is not only for the King: but
it is tam pro rege, quam pro, etc. Fine. Estreat.
and so part of the Fine does belong to the Subject, and for that part the
Prosecutor may have a privy Seal here to recover it: Estreat.
but if it be estreated into the Exchequer be cannot there have it, and so he
shall lose his reward, and therefore he desired the Fine might be respited. But
the Court answered, we cannot respite the Kings part, nor the other part: for
there is an execution out for the whole Fine which cannot be stayed.

Heyford against Hobson.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
HEyford brought an Action of Trover and Conversion against Hobson in the
Common Pleas for taking away and converting of diverse of his Goods and Chattels
particularly named, Arrest of judgment in Trover and Conversion.
and had a verdict. The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, that the
Declaration was uncertain, for amongst other things the Plaintiff in his
Declaration declares for the taking de duobus castoribus, Anglice Hats, whereas
castor is not a proper word for a Hat. 2ly. de uno servitio argenteo, Anglice
one silver Salt, and there is no such word for a Salt, but there is another
proper Latin word for it, viz. salinarium. 3ly. De duobus, catenis, Anglice two
silver Dishes, which is no word for a Dish, much less a silver Dish. Roll
Justice said, one may describe a thing in a Declaration, Declaration.
if there be not a proper word to express it, and if it be so described that
the Jury may know what is meant by it, it is well enough. But let the Judgment
be here be stayed, for we will advise.

Wood against Clemence.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THis Case formerly ( viz. this Term) moved and spoken to touching the validity
of an Award made touching the freight of a Ship, Exceptions to an award.
was again moved, and Exceptions taken to the Award. 1. That the award is
repugnant in it self. And 2ly. It is not final, and so not good. The Court
answered, if the Award be ill, as of your own showing it is, then you have no
cause of Action, Judgment. Submission.
and so you cannot have Judgment, although the Defendants bar be not good, and
a submission made by one for himself, and another, is good to bind the party
that submitted. But move it again, and we will advise in the mean time.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court was moved to quash an Endictment of forcible Entry after the party
endicted had pleaded, To quash an endictment of forcible entry.
and a verdict against him. Roll Justice, We must not be so curious in the
framing of Endictments, as to quash them for every small fault, and in this
Case it was said by him, that if one interrupt a long possession by force, and
the other regain it with undue means, an Endictment lies not against him for
this, for this is but vim vi repellere, and after a verdict, and before
Judgment upon an Endictment of forcible entry, Restitution.
the party ought not to move for restitution.

Banister against Wright.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
IN a Trial at the Bar between Banister and Wright in an Action upon the
Statute of 2. Ed. 6. for not setting forth of Tithes, Lands free from tithes.
It was said by the Court that Tithes which lie not within any Parish are due
to the King, and that Lands must be parcel of a Parish, either by prescription,
or by Act of Parliament, and that Lands lying within a Forest, and in the hands
of the King do not pay Tithes, although they be within a Parish: Tithes.
but if the Lands be dis aforested, and be within a Parish, they ought to pay
Tithes, for their not paying Tithes being in the hands of the King, is but an
immunity for that time only.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
A Baker was presented in a Court Leet for selling Bread under weight, Arrest
of judgment in an action for a Fine set at a Court leet. Fine. Amercement.
Presentment.
and a Fine set upon him, and an action brought against him for this Fine, and
a verdict given against him. It was moved in arrest of Judgment, that the
presentment upon which the Action was founded was not good, and so there was no
ground of Action, and so there ought to be no Judgment. But Roll Justice
answered, that the Action is for the Amercement which is a collateral thing,
and the presentment is not now to be called in question, if it be only
avoidable for some fault in it: but it were otherwise, if the presentment were
utterly void. But speak again to it at another time.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court was moved for a Habeas Corpus for one committed at Norwitch for
Treason in speaking words against the Queen, For a Habeas corpus to remove a
Prisoner committed for Treason. Endictment. Trial.
because be could not be tried there. Roll Justice answered, he cannot be
endicted here, except the fact were done in Middlesex, therefore advise with
the Kings Council, and prefer a Bill of Endictment where the fact was, and then
you shall have a Writ ad delibrandum directed to the place where the fact was,
and this is at the Kings suit, and the Sherif shall be allowed his charges upon
his account, or else the Justices may try him by their Commission of oyer and
terminer.

Smith and Hancock, and others.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
SMith brought an Action of Trespass against Hancock and others, For a new
trial, because of a mistryal.
for taking away diverse parcels of Ribbin from him. The Defendants pleaded by
way of Justification, the Custom of London against Hawkers, viz. to take away
wares from any that sold them up and down the Streets. The Plaintiff replied,
that there was no such custom, and issue was taken upon it and thereupon the
custom was certifyed by the mouth of the Recorder, and a trial upon it in
London and a verdict for the Defendants. The Plaintiff moved in arrest of
Judgment, that it was a mis-tryal, because it was before them that were
interes^ed in the cause, and therefore desired there might be another trial.
Roll Justice said, it is against natural equity, for one to be Judge in his own
cause, Trial.
although the other party admit it to be so, and therefore it is a mistryall,
though it were at the request of the Plaintiff, because it is against natural
reason, 8 E. 3. f. 69. 5 Ed. 3.8. 9 H. 7. f. 21. Hill. 38 Eliz. in the
Exchequer. The prayer of the Plaintiff cannot help the trial, for the consent
of both parties cannot change the Law, much less the prayer of one of the
parties. Hales of Council with the Defendants argued that it was not a
mis-tryall, and said this concerns them in point of privilege of the City, and
not merely in point of interest, before whom the Judgment was gievn. 2ly. The
consent of the party has barred him of the advantage which otherwise he might
have had. But Roll Justice answered, here is point of interest as well as point
of privilege, for part of the goods taken come to the benefit of the City, and
therefore they ought not to be their own Judges, for this is against natural
reason, and so it is a mistryal. But it does not appear here whether the Mayor
and Aldermen be another Corporation or not, and distinct from the Corporation
alleged, which certified this custom by the mouth of the Recorder, and this is
the sole doubt in the Case. The Court ordered that there should be a new trial
except cause shown to the contrary: Q. whether there shall be a Repleader, or a
new venire.

White and his wife against Harwood and his wife.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
WHite and his wife brought an Action upon the Case for standerous words,
Whether a writ abated by death of one of the defendants. Abatement.
against Harwood and his wife; the Defendant dies, the Feme takes another
Husband pending the suit. It was moved that the writ was abated. The Court
inclined that because the Defendant had by her marriage changed her name,
therefore the Writ was abated, but took time to advise.

Slade.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court was moved for Judgment formerly stayed upon a certificate made by
Baron Atkins, For Judgment stayed upon a Judges certificat.
that the verdict passed against his opinon, Bacon Justice said, Judgments
have been arrested in the Common pleas, upon such certificates. Hales of
Council with the Defendant prayed, that this Judgment might be arrested, and
that there might be a new trial, for that it has been done heretofore in like
cases. But Roll Justice held, it ought not to be stayed, Attaint. 9
though it have been done in the Common pleas, for it was too Arbitrary for
them to do it, and you may have your attaint against the Jury, and there is no
other remedy in Law for you; but it were good to advise the party to suffer a
new trial for better satisfaction. And let the Defendant take four days from
hence to speak in arrest of Judgment if the postea be brought in, if not, then
four days from the time it shall be brought in.

Andrews against Baily.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Upon a trial at the Bar between Andrews and Baily, Denisation by Letters

upon an ejectment lease touching Sir John Prowds title to Lands. It was said,
that a man cannot be a subject to two several Princes. And that denisation by

Dunch against Smith and others.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hill. 23 Car. rot. 37.
DUnch brought an Action of Debt as an Executor for arrerages of a rent charge
due to the Testator, Demurrer to a Declaration in Debt.
against Smith and others the occupyers of the Land. The Defendants demur to
the Declaration, and for cause show that it does not set forth what estate the
Defendants have in the lands charged with the rent, and so it appears not that
they are to pay the rent. Hales of Council with the plaintiff answered, that
it is not necessary for the Plaintiff to set it forth, for he is a stranger to
the Estate, and cannot know what Estate it is. Roll Justice said, It does not
appear by the Declaration whether the Defendants claim under him that granted
the rent or no. But move it again Saturday next. Postea.

Smith against Hale.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
SMith brought an Action of Debt against Hale for rent; Demurrer to privilege
of Parliament.
The Defendant pleaded that he is Tenant and Servant to the Lord Moon a Lord
of the Parliament, and prays his Writ of Privilege may be allowed. The
Plaintiff demurs, It was argued by Barton of the middle Temple, that the plea
was ill, for the very matter of it for the privilege is against the Common Law,
and also against the Statute Law, and for proof cited 1 E. 1. f. 26. 2 E. 3. f.
3. 2 Ed. 6. C. 8. Roll Justice answered, Privilege.
you ought not to argue generally against the Privilege of Parliament, for you
know that every Court has its privilege, as this Court also has, therefore
apply your self particularly to this question, Admittance.
whether a Writ of privilege belongs to a Parliament man so far as to protect
his Lands and Estate, and I conceive he is so privileged; And you have
admitted his privilege by your own Demurrer. But we will advise.

Wright.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
AN Action of Debt was brought upon an Obligation to perform Articles;
Plaintiff after a verdict for him moves for a new trial.
The Defendant pleaded Covenants performed: The Plaintiff had a verdict, and
after verdict, and before Judgment, he moved for a new trial, because it
appeared that there was no issue joined; the Plaintiff moved it for his own
expedition, for he feared if he should enter Judgment, that the Defendant
would bring a Writ of Error. The Court answered, that there was a perfect issue
joined; but the pleading is not good, and it was your own fault to join issue
upon such a pleading, when you might have demurred. Trial.
Yet let the Defendant show cause why he should not consent to a new trial, and
a Repleader.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
MEmorandum on Wednesday the 14 of November 1648 Henry Roll Sergeant at law
then one of the Justices of this Bench took his place in Court as Lord chief
Justice of England, and Twisden moved for a day to plead between Dunch and
Smith being the first motion that was made in Court after he took his place.
The Lord chief Justice Roll first took his place.


Popham against Hunt.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg:
Mich. 23 Car. rot. 558.
POpham brings an Action of Covenant upon an Indenture against Hunt, Demurrer
to a Declaration in an action of Covenant.
the Defendant demurs to the Declaration, and the Plaintiff joins in the
Demurrer: Upon the pleading the Case appeared to be this, a Feme sole delivers
a certain sum of money into the hands of I. S. and the Defendant thereupon
Covenants with the Feme to pay unto A. B. 100 l. a year, so long as the money
should continue in the hands of I. S. The Feme takes Baron; The hundred pound
per annum is arrere. The Baron makes his Executor, and dies, and after his
death the 100 l. a year is behind also. Popham the Executor brings this Action
of Covenant, Covenant.
and the question was whether the Action was well brought, and the Court held
the Action did lie, for the Covenant does concern the Executor, because he
represents the Testator; but the question here is whether the rent due after
the death of the Husband ought to be paid, and how it shall be known whether he
be dead for it is not specially alleged, and if he be not dead there is no
cause of Action. Therefore consider of this.

Bragg against Nightingall:
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. 24 Car. rot. 601.
BRagg brought an Action of Covenant against Nightingall upon an Indenture.
Demurrer to a Declaration in an action of covenant.
The Defendant demurs to the Declaration, The Case was this. The Plaintiff let
by Indenture certain houses for diverse years to the Defendant, and covenanted
with him to repair the houses by such a day expressed in the Indenture. The
Defendant by the same Indenture covenanted with the Plaintiff, that from the
time that the Plaintiff was to repair the houses, unto the end of the Term for
which they were demised, he would well and sufficiently repair and leave them
so repaired at the end of the Term; for not performing of this Covenant, on the
Defendants part the Plaintiff brought his Action. The cause showed for the
demurrer to the Declaration was, that the Plaintiff had not showed that he on
his part had repaired the houses according to his Covenant, and so the
Defendant supposed he was not bound to repair, because he was to repair from
the time the Plaintiff had repaired them, and not before, and so there is no
cause of Action. After diverse motions Roll chief Justice said, That here was a
reciprocal Covenant to be performed on each part, Covenant
and although one do not perform the Covenant on his part, this does not excuse
the other party, but he is tied to perform his Covenant nevertheless, and if
he do not an Action lies against him, and he may bring his Action also against
the other that first broke his Covenant, and therefore the Action lies here
against the Defendant, and so the demurrer is not good upon the cause showed.
But if this were not a reciprocal Covenant the Law would be otherwise, and
cited Hayes and Hayes Case 11 Car. and Skippon and Lucas his case 10 Car. But
Bacon Justice held the contrary that the demurrer was good, for that it appears
that it was the intent of both parties that the Plaintiff should first repair,
and after that the Defendant should keep the houses in repair. The Court would
advise.

Smithson against Wells.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
SMithson brought an Action upon the Case upon a promise against Wells, A
special verdict in an action upon the Case upon a promise.
and declared upon a promise made to save the Plaintiff harmless from such an
obligation when he should be thereunto required. The Defendant pleaded non
Assumpsit, and upon this a special verdict was found, viz. generally that the
Defendant did make promise to save the Plaintiff harmless from the Obligation,
and that he had not done it. The question hereupon was, whether the verdict had
found the same promise set forth in the Declaration, because that was to save
harmless upon request; Verdict.
but the promise in the verdict mentions no request to be made, but finds a
promise generally to save one harmless. The Court held that the Plaintiff
ought to have Judgment, for that it was the same promise found in the verdict,
which was set forth in the Declaration, for if one promise to save one
harmless from a thing, he that made the promise ought to do it at his peril
without request, Request. Covenant.
and the request is not material although the promise say upon request; But if
he be damnified if I do recompense him upon request made, the Covenant is not
broken.

Emerson against Ridley.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Pasc. 24 Car. rot. 400.
RIdley brought an Action of Debt upon an Obligation against Emerson; Error
upon a Judgment in Debt upon an Obligation.
The Condition of the Obligation was, that the Defendant should not put his
Cattle upon such a Common before a trial and proof, for the Common should be
for the Commoners, and assigns a breach, that he did put on his Cattle upon the
Common before the Trial for the Commoners; upon this an Issue was joined, and a
verdict, and a Judgment for the Plaintiff. The Defendant brings a Writ of
Error, and assigns for Error, that the breach of the Condition assigned does
not agree with the Condition of the Obligation, and so the action being brought
upon the Obligation, and no breach of the Condition being rightly assigned,
there appears no cause of Action, and so the Judgment is erroneous. But it was
said by the Council with the Defendant, that trial and proof of a matter in
common intendment is all one, Intendment.
and so the difference alleged was only verbal and not real, and it shall be
taken to be a breach of the Condition, and so there is good cause of Action,
and the Judgment thereupon given is well enough. Holhead on Council on the
other side denied it to be all one in sense, for that a Trial may be, and yet
the Title may not not proved, and there may be a Judgment upon a Nihil dicit,
where is nothing proved, and so concluded the Writ of Error did lie. The Court
desired to have Books. Postea.

Jones against Jacob.
24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Jones a Citizen and Pewterer of London, Judgment in an action upon the Case.
brought an Action upon the Case against Jacob for these words spoken of him.
He is gone, and does hide himself for debt, and for ought I know he is a
Banckrupt. The Plaintiff had a verdict, and upon the Defendants motion the
Judgment was former y stayed. The Plaintiff moves for Judgment
notwithstanding: for that the words are actionable. The Court said the words
are scandalous, and by them he is disgraced in his Trade. Hales of Council with
the Defendant said, that there were other words in the Declaration which are
not actionable, and yet damages are given for both, Damages.
which ought not to be, and therefore no Judgment could be given. The words
said not to be actinable were these, Have a care, and do not trust him, for he
will run away and pay you nothing. But the Court held, that both the words
taken together are actionable, and ruled the Plaintiff to have his Judgment
for both the words, if better matter be not showed.

Nelson against Tompson.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. 24 Car. rot. 343.
NElson brought an Action of Debt against Tompson upon an Obligation with a
Condition to save the Plaintiff harmless. Demurrer to a replication in Debt
upon an Obligation.
The Defendant pleaded non damnificatus. The Plaintiff replied and showed a
breach on the Defendants part, whereby he was damnified. The Defendant demurs
to the replication, and for cause shows, that the breach was assigned to be at
Westminster, Place.
and does not show in what County Westminster is. The Court held, that though
Westminster be a City, yet it ought to be showed in what County it lies,
because it is not a County of it self. Therefore advise what you will do, for
the Action is fit to be discontinued. Discontinuance.


Thyn against Thyn.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
LAtch moved again in this case, that the Summons does not appear upon the
retorn to be well made: Whether a Summons well returned.
for it is not said to be made at the Churchdore, as the Statute directs. To
this nothing was answered. But Bacon Justice said, the retorn was naught for
another reason, and so there is no Record before us to proceed upon; in the
Writ of Error the fault is this, The Custos brevium ought to make the retorn
here, and it is mentioned to be made per unum deputatorum suorum; Retorn.
whereas his Deputy had no authority to do it. Therefore you had best to take a
new Writ of Certiorari, and certify the same matter by it, and this the Court
may grant though it be very rare: for if one will assign an Error in a Record
and pray a Certificate, and nothing be done upon it, we cannot proceed.
Consider which way you can help this fault.

Tracye against Poole
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
TRacye brought an Action upon the Case against Poole upon a promise, Arrest of
Judgment in an action on the Case upon a promise.
and declares, that Poole the Defendant in consideration of a marriage to be had
between the Plaintiffs son, and the Defendants daughter, and of settling so much
Land upon him upon the marriage, He did assume and promise that within such a
time after the marriage had, he and his Son should be bound per scriptum suum
debita juris forma fiend. unto the Plaintiff, for the payment for 3000 l. for a
marriage portion, and assigns the breach that the Defendant and his son did not
become bound per scriptum suum Obligatorium: for the payment of the 3000 l. and
for this he brings his Action. The Plaintiff had a verdict. The Defendant in
arest of Judgment moves that the breach was not well assigned: Breach.
for the Assumpsit was that the Defendant and his Son should be bound per
scriptum suum debita juris forma fiend. and the breach is, that they did not
give security per scriptum suum Obligatorium, which agrees not with the
Assumpsit: for the Defendant might give security by a Judgment, which is not
scriptum suum; yet it is debita forma juris factum, upon this the Judgment was
for that time stayed, though then Bacon Justice inclined, that the breach was
well assigned, because in common construction it shall be intended, that the
Defendant assumed to give his own and his sons bond for security. Hales of
Council with the Plaintiff at another day moved for Judgment, and held, that
the breach was well assigned, for that it expresses the substance of the
promise, though not the very words of it, and this was held good, 7 Car. in
Michill and Cars case. 2ly. If the meaning of the promise be considered, it
will appear that the Defendant and his Son were to be bound by Obligation 6
Car. Courtny and Gavills Case, and indeed the promise cannot be satisfied by
any other way than by an Obligation, for a Judgment or a Statute will not do
it; for by them he is not said to be bound; and though all this be admitted
against me, yet it is now after a verdict, and the Jury have found the breach
Maynard for the Defendant argued, that the breach was not well assigned: for
the breach assigned tends to a personal engagement for paying the 3000 l. which
is not so expressed in the promise, but only a general security to be given for
the moneys, and a recognisance, and a judgment are not properly scriptum, as
in 9 Car. Goldsmith and Sydners Case, and the Declaration does not set forth
the death of Sir Henry Poole by whom the security was to be given, and so it
cannot appear whether he had a convenient time to do it as he ought to have,
and he held, that the Plaintiff was bound to do the first act, viz. to tender
the Obligation to the Defendant, or else he is not bound to seal, and deliver
any, Request.
and also he ought to make a particular request to him to seal and deliver it.
Hales replied if a man plead a Statute, it is true, that he ought to say per
scriptum suum, Pleading.
but pleading ought to be more nice than common parlance. 2ly. The living of
Sir Henry Poole is expressed, and there appears time convenient between the
promise and the time of his death for performing of it. 3ly. It is not
necessary for us to tender a bond, but the other ought to have done it at his
own peril, for it is to be done at his charge and not at ours. Roll Chief
Justice held, that Judgment ought to be given for the Plaintiff, and said,
that for the laying of the promise it is not necessary to pursue the very words
of the promise, but the substance, so that there may appear to the Court, that
there is cause of Action. 2ly. He held that there is no variance in the
substance: for the intent of the parties is to be considered, which was, to
have another act done by Sir Henry Poole and his Son, per aliquod scriptum, and
not by a verbal promise, and we are to consider if the breach assigned agree to
this, and he held, that the promise will extend to a Judgment, or a
recognisance: for a Judgment, Statute, or Recognisance is scriptum, and for
the time, the Defendant ought to have alleged, that he bad not convenient time,
Tender.
if the truth were so: but here does appear convenient time, and it is not
necessary for the Plaintiff to tender the Obligation: but the Defendant ought
to do it at his own peril, and to pay the money in convenient time after the
marriage, and the other is not bound to demand it, Intendment.
nor to be at the charge to make the Obligation. Bacon Justice to the same
effect, and said, the words ought to be intended of a writing obligatory,
according to common intendment, Time.
and the meaning of the parties; although it be not so expressed, and it cannot
be meant of a promise by parol, for there are no presidents in Law for verbal
securities, but only for securities in writing, and the word in debita juris
forma implies so much, otherwise here would be only one promise to make good
another promise, Pasc. 9 Iac. rot. 361. Banc. Reg. and 21 Iac. upon a Writ of
Error in the Exchequer-Chamber, the former Judgment was affirmed, and the
breach here assigned meets with the Assumpsit, for it is that he did not become
bound per, etc. and so the breach is well assigned. 2ly. Here appears in the
Declaration to be two Months for the performing the promise, which is a
convenient time, and there does not appear any hinderance, and the Defendant
was bound to do it without request, and there is no necessity for the Plaintiff
to make an election of the time when he will have it done. The Court bid the
Plaintiff take his Judgment, except better matter were showed on Monday
following.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court was moved to quash an Endictment of forcible entry. To quesh an
Endictment.
The Exception was, that the forcible entry is said is to be made in messuagium
sive tenementum, which is uncertain. But Roll Chief Justice doubted, whether
the exception was good or not, because it was messuagium sive tenementum, and
the word Message may be good though Tenemen tum be not. But it was quashed
upon another exception.

The King against VVood.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court was moved to quash an Endictment taken at a Sessions against one
Wood for getting the horse of another man into his possession, To quash an
Endictment.
by using another man's name, and a false token. The exceptions taken against it
were, 1. The Endictment does not say that it was contra Statutum: But to this
the Court answered that it was an offense at the Common Law, and the Endictment
lay at the Common Law, and therefore it need not to be expressed to be contra
formam Statuti. 2ly. It does not show what the false token was, nor in whose
name it was used. But Roll chief Justice took another exception, viz. that the
Endictment was that the Defendant did the fact nuper, and that is so general a
word that no answer can be given to it. And for that it was quashed.

Twigg against Roberts.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Hill. 22 Car. rot. 956.
AN Action of Debt was brought against an Executor in Bristow upon a Custom of
concessit solvere by him to pay a Debt due by the Testator upon a simple
contract, and a verdict and a Judgment for the Plaintiff. Error to reverse a
Judgment in Debt against an Executor.
The Defendant brought a Writ of Error in this Court to reverse the Judgment,
and the Error assigned was, that the custom of bringing an Action of Debt upon
a concessit solvere is not a good custom, Custom. Wager of Law
because it hindrers the party to wage his Law, as by the Law he may do. Walker
of Council with the Defendant in the Writ of Error argued that it was a good
custom, because the party is not thereby hindered of a trial, and there are
customs in London which are against the Common Law, as for example for the
Recorder to give Judgment upon an exigent. The Court desired to see the book,
and to have presidents brought them: And said, This Custom had been allowed
against the party that made the contract; but the doubt is whether it be good
against an Executor, for a concessit solvere is without any consideration. And
Roll chief Justice said, that this custom does break three rules of the Law.

Barker against Denham.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. 23 Car. rot. 1280.
BArker brought an ejectione firmae against Denham, Special verdict in an
Ejectione firmae.
and upon not guilty pleaded an issue was joined, and the reupon a special
verdict was found that by the Custom of the manor, whereof the Lands in
question were held, a Copyholder might surrender his Copyhold out of Court into
the hands of two customary Tenants, to the use of another, and at the next
Court the party to whose use the Copyhold was so surrendered used to be
admitted, and That there was such a surrender made here, but that the party to
whose use the Copyhold was so surrendered dyed before the next Court, and so was
not admitted. The question was whether he dying before his admittance, shall be
said to be a Copyholder by the Custom of the manor or no. Descent.
Hales Argued, that he is not a Copyholder within the Custom, and then if this
Custom hinder not, the Lands shall descend according to the rules of the Common
Law, for so is it of all Copyhold Lands if a special custom hinder not, and
here 1. the words of the Custom are to be considered, and 2ly. Custom.
how they are to be expounded, and for this he cited 49 E. 3. f. 19.22 E. 3.2
E. 4. f. 24. A Custom shall be construed according to the Common apprehension
of the lay gens, and a Custom shall be interpreted according to the most
effectual operation of the Law, 3 H. 7.5. Doct. and Stud. 48.21 H. 7. f. 33.44
Ass. f. 10.4 H 8. Dyer 28. A denial actual by a Copyholder to pay his rent is a
forfeiture, Forfeiture.
not an implicative denial, lib. intrat. f. 238. And by a surrender of a
Copyhold before admittance the surrendree has no real possession, and the heir
of a Copyholder before his admittance holds by the Copy of his Ancestor, and so
he has title; but the surrenderee can have no title before admittance, Title.
and he cited Rawlins and Jones his case, and Spurlins case. A surrender before
admittance, is but a a consent of the party to part with the estate, but
passes it not, and after administration it should have no relation to the
surrender. Twisden for the Defendant. Relation.
1. He agreed that a Copyholder before admittance is not perfect in his Estate;
but yet the admittance shall relate to the surrender, and both shall be
accounted one entire Act, contrary to other learnings. 2ly. The Son is in by
descent, and the descent must be ruled by the custom, and he is now really a
Copyholder, and cited Shellyes case, and prayed Judgment for the Defendant.
Roll chief Justice said, This Case differs from surrendering into the hands of
Tenants, for it is into the hands of the Steward out of Court, Surrend.
Admission.
which is good, and the Lords acceptance of his rent is an admission. But Bacon
doubted, and therefore the rule was for the Case to be argued again the next
Term, and then by reason of sickness I was absent. But that Term held not by
reason of the Kings death.

Dunch against Smith.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
DUnch brought an Action of Debt as Executor for arrerages of a rent charge due
to the Testator against Dunch, Arrest of Judgment in Debt brought by an
Executor.
an occupyer of the land, out of which the rent was issuing, and has a
verdict. The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, and for Cause showed that
the Plaintiff does not show any title that the Defendant has in the Land; but
only says generally that he entered into the Lands, and so it appears not that
he is to pay the rent. To this the Council on the other side answered, that the
Plaintiff being but an Executor cannot know the title, and therefore is not
bound to show it. Roll chief Justice said, there can be no Judgment, for the
Declaration is too general. But Bacon Justice held the Declaration good
enough. Antea.

Brown against Poyns.

THe Case was this a man made his last Will, and made two Executors, For a

the Executors dye in the life of the Testator, the Testator dies having two
Sisters, the eldest Sister procures Administration, the younger Sister moves
for a Prohibition to repeal the Administration, because she being in equal
degree of king ought to have equal share of the Administration. But the Court
answered that a prohibition lies not, for you may appeal if the Administration
be not rightly granted,

and it was moved that there has been a general pardon by Parliament since
that time, by which deodands were pardoned, and therefore it was prayed the
process might be stayed. General pardon.
The Court asked whether there be not an exception of deodands or the Almoners
interest in the pardon: The Council answered there is not: The Court demanded
by what words in the pardon are deodands pardoned; The Council answered by the
general words. The Court ordered thereupon it should be stayed till the
Almoner be heard what he can say.

THe Court was moved for a habeas Corpus for one that was taken in Execution by
the Sheriff, and was afterward set at liberty, For a habeas corpus for one

but you are in the wrong way, for you ought to bring your audita querela.

The King against Bray.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court was moved to quash an Endictment of forcible entry made upon a
Lessee for years, upon the Statute of 21 Iac. To quash an Endictment of
forcible entry.
The exceptions taken to it were, 1. It does not appear by the Endictment that
the Lessee had any title to the Land at the time of the force committed, for
the force is supposed to be done before the lease commenced. 2ly. The lease is
supposed to be a lease for so many years, if I. S. shall so long live, and it
is not averred that I. S. was alive at the time of the forcible entry made.
Averment.
Roll chief Justice cited the Lady Morlyes case, that there ought to be a
direct allegation of the life. Therefore let it be quashed.

Mich. 24. Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court was moved to quash an Endictment of Assault and Battery of an
overseer of the poor villae de A. in executing of his office: The exceptions
taken to it were, To quash an Endictment for assaulting a Collector for the
poor.
1. That there is no such officer as an overseer of the poor villae, but it
ought to be parochiae; but the Court said it was well enough, as it was, though
it had been more proper the other way. 2ly. The Endictment is for the
Assaulting, and beating a Collector for the poor in executing his office,
whereas there is no such office appointed for any one particular man by the
Law, for the Statute is, that there shall be two Collectors for the poor in
every Parish, and so the office is joint, and not several; But the Court
overruled this exception also; 3ly. It wants vi et Armis. Upon this exception
the Court bid the Council move it again.

Gill against Cross.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Plaintiff brought an Action of Debt against two as Administrators, upon
fully administered pleaded issue was joined, Special verdict in Debt against
Executors.
and a special verdict was found to this effect, viz. that one of the
Administrators had fully administered, and that the other Administrator had
assets. It was urged against the Verdict that the issue that was found is
impertinent and impossible; Verdict. Judgment.
and so there can be no judgment given upon it. But the Court answered that
the verdict is good, yet if Judgment should be given upon it, the Judgment
would be ill, and Nevills and Greenwoods case, Hill. 7. Car. in the Exchequer.
rot. 1189. was cited, and it was said that Judgment may be against that
Executor who has assets, and nil capiat per billam against the other that has
fully administered. But take Judgment at your peril.

Preston against Holmes.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Trin. or Mich. 24 Car. rot. 2052.
Upon a special verdict found the Case in effect was this, Arguments upon a
special verdict upon a Will.
one in see having one Son by one venture, and another Son by a second venture,
did by his last Will devise all his Lands to his wise for life, and after her
death to I. his eldest Son, and to his Heirs and the question was whether the
Son shall take these Lands by the devise or as Heir at Law, and so the devise
to be of no effect to make him come to the Lands by purchase, Christopher
Turner held, that the devise is void, because it says no more than the Law
says, for if there had been no such devise, John and his Heirs should have had
the Land, and he cited Paramour and Yardlves Case in the Comentaries, and Hob.
rep. Counden and Clarks case. But it is objected, that in this case the Law
speaks one thing, and the devise another thing, and so the devise says not the
same thing. To this I answer, there is no difference concerning the alteration
of the Estate, between what the Law directs, and what the devise directs, all
the difference is in the manner how his Son John shall come to the Estate, 3
and 4 Phil. and Mar. Dyer, 134. and 37 Eliz. A man seized in fee had issue two
Daughters, and devised the Lands to them, and to their Heirs, and it was
questioned whether they were Joint tenants, and I conceive they are, and where
one omits a thing in a conveyance which the Law supplies, this shall not hurt,
and he cited Iennings and Pollards Case, 6 Car. Hales on the other side argued,
that the Son takes by purchase, and not by descent: for the devise is not to
the Son in present, but after the death of the Testators wife, and if he had
the Lands by descent, he should have them presently. VVaiver.
It is true the Son might have waived the taking by purchase, and might have
taken by descent: but here prima facie he shall be intended to be in by
purchase, and not descent, for here does not appear to be any actual waiver of
the purchase, and the Son does here as I conceive, take by way of remainder,
and not by way of reversion. And as to the verdict I conceive it is not good,
for it does not show how the lands are held, whether in Chivalry or Socage, and
so it appears not whether the Testator had power to devise all of them or not,
for if they be held in Chivalry, he can devise but two parts of them, as the
Statute directs. 2ly. It appears not, that the Testator had but one Son by his
first wife. 3ly. It is not showed, that the Lands are parcel of the Manor,
4ly. It does not appear in whose possession the Lands are. Roll chief Justice
said, Lands that are given by Will shall be intended to be socage tenure,
Intention.
if the contrary do not appear. And he held that the devise is void, and that
it is not in the power of John the Son, to make the election to take by descent
or by purchase at his pleasure, but he must of necessity take the Land as the
Law directs. which is by descent; Maxim.
and it is against a maxim in Law to give a thing to such a person to whom the
Law gives it, if it had not been so given, 3 and 4 Phil. and Ma. Dyer, 134. and
therefore the Plaintiff ought to have Judgment; And as to the verdict he has
primer possession, Verdict.
and therefore if the other make no title, the verdict is for him, and good
enough. Bacon Justice to the same intent, viz. that the Heir does here take by
descent, and not by purchase, for this the Law says, and he cannot alter it,
and cited Foscues Case, 4 Car. and a Case in 7 Iac. And so judgment was given
for the Plaintiff.

Franck against Burt and others.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Plaintiff brought an Action of Trespass for breaking of his House, For
costs for the Desendant upon non-sute of the Plaintiff.
and carrying away his Goods, at the Trial the Plaintiff was non-sute. The
Plaintiff moved, that there was error in the Declaration, and therefore there
could have been no Judgment, and prays that he may be spared costs. Roll chief
Justice answered, that heretofore it has been made a question, whether the
Plaintiff being non-sute should pay costs, Cests.
but since the Statute of 4 Iac. it is clear, he ought to pay costs for the
vexation of the Defendant, and so it has been ruled here, and you are out of
Court now by being non-sute, and therefore you must pay costs; And therefore
except better matter be showed, let them be paid.

THe Court was moved for a Prohibition to the great Sessions of Carnarvan in
Wales to stop a suit in an English Bill of Equity exhibited there, For a
prohibition to the great Sessions at Carnarvan in Wales.
whereas by the Bill it appears there is no matter of Equity in the Case, but
only matter tryable at the Law. The Court answered, if they proceed there
against Equity, we cannot hinder them. There was wont to be an Agent here from
the Commissioners there for us to confer with in such cases as these, but it
seems there is not any here now. Therefore give notice, Prohibition.
and let them show cause the next Term, why a Prohibition should not be granted.

Upon reading of a retorn made by the Sherifs of the City of Norwitch upon a
Habeas corpus directed unto them for one Chambers, It was said by the Court,
How a Habeas corpus to an inferior Court should be returned. Retorn.
that it has been ruled, That upon a Habeas Corpus to an inferior Court to
remove Corpus cum causa, they ought to retorn all the causes that are depending
there concerning the party that has the Habeas Corpus, if any of the causes
depending be for above five pound of which they ought not to hold Plea, and
therefore because all the causes were not returned here upon the retorn of this
Habeas Corpus, The Court held, the retorn was not good, and ordered that it
should be amended upon pain of ten pounds by Monday next.

Raph against Davye.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
RAph brought an Action of the Case against Davy for speaking these words of
her to the Plaintifs mother, Arrest of judgment in an action for words.
viz. Your Daughter, innuendo the Plaintiff, is a brazen faced Whore, and
deserves to be hanged, and for speaking these other words to the Plaintiff
herself, viz. you Huswife are a Thief, and have stolen my Purse. The Plaintiff
had a verdict; The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, Averment.
that the Plaintiff does not aver, that her Mother had not any other Daughter
besides herself, and so it is uncertain, whether the words were spoken of her
or no. But the Court held, it was well enough without such averment, because
the Declaration is, that the Defendant habens colloquium of the Plaintiff did
speak the words, and that makes it certain enough; And therefore bid the
Plaintiff take her Judgment.

Jennings against Lee.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
IEnnings brought an Action of Assault and Battery against Lee. The Defendant
pleads a special plea, Arrest of Judgment in an action of assault and battery.
and justifies. The Plaintiff replies de injuria sua propria, and upon this an
Issue is joined, and a verdict found for the Plaintiff. The Defendant moved in
arrest of Judgment, that the replication was not good, because it answers not
the special matter pleaded, nor takes any traverse by an absque tali causa as
it ought to do, and so there is no issue joined, and consequently there can be
no Judgment. Roll chief Justice said, that the replying de injuria sua
propria, Traverse. Issue. Ieofails.
and not traversing absque tali causa is not good, for there is not an
affirmative and a negative, and so there is no issue joined, and therefore
there can be no Judgment; and it is a direct Ieofail, and it is not helped by
the Verdict, for it is no trial, and not a mistryal which a verdict may help.
If there be two or three things in a Declaration upon which an issue may be
joined, if an issue be joined upon any of them it is well, but here is no issue
joined at all: for the replication does no more but affirm the wrong done, as
the Count did. Therefore consider how you can help it. Postea.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Upon the reading of a retorn of a Writ of privilege granted for one to be
restored to the place of an Alderman of the Town of Stafford, Exceptions to a
Retorn of a Writ of Privilege.
Hales took these exceptions to the retorn, 1. that one cause showed for the
disfranchising the party was, that he had done contrary to his oath,
Disfranchisement.
which he said was no sufficient cause for the dis-franchising of the party,
for their Letters patents do not warrant it. A second cause returned is, for
that he did not make an account of such moneys, as he had received for the use
of the City, and this concerns not the party as an Alderman, and therefore his
misdemeanour in that office can be no cause to put him from his place of
Alderman. 3ly. It is returned for cause that he did mis-behave himself in his
place whilst he was Mayor of the City, and this as the former is no cause to
put him from his Aldermans place. A fourth cause returned is, for speaking
contemptuous words against the Mayor and Aldermen, viz. Knock your heads
together till I come, which words cannot be so contemptuons as to be put out of
his place for them, Retorn.
for they are not so much as actionable. 5ly. He held, that if any of these
causes singly, or all of them together were sufficient to dis-franchise him,
yet they have not showed, that they have lawfully removed him, for it appears
not that he was summoned to answer any of the things objected against him,
neither does it apyear, that he was dis-franchised by those that ought to have
done it. The retorn was ordered to be filed, and time given to answer these
exceptions till the next Term.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
Upon an Affidavit read, For a Procedendo.
that the cause was removed hither by the Plaintiff, The Defendant moves for a
Procedendo, that the Court may proceed where the Plaintiff first brought his
Action. But the Court answered, that the Plaintiff may remove his cause hither
by Certiorari, and upon the retorn of the Certiorari the Defendant ought to
tender bayl, and if the Plaintiff will not accept of it a Procedendo may be
granted.

Wood against Clement.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Case of VVood and Clement formerly spoken unto, Arguments of Council, and
the Judges opinionstrouching an Award.
was again moved and spoken to, first by Twisden, who argued, that the Award
set forth is void for two reasons. 1. Because it is not final, for it awards
one to pay money to I. S. to the use of another, without his consent, and this
cannot determine the matter in controversy, but does beget suits. 2ly. It is
against reason, that the money due to the Mariners should be paid to any, but
the Mariners themselves, and this is not submitted, and if it were, yet it is
ill, for the Mariners include not the Master. Maynard held, that the Award was
void to this clause, and so there is no breach assigned, and consequently there
can be no Judgment given, although some other part of the Award be good, and
here is nothing awarded concerning John Acland, who is one of the parties that
submitted to the Arbitration, and so as to the money he has no satisfaction by
the Award, 2 Rich. 3. f. ^^. Hill moved, that the Arbitrators have made an
Award touching a thing not submitted: for the differences submitted are
touching the Ship called the Salvadore, and they have made an Award touching
the Ship, and the proceed thereof. Hales on the other side held, that John
Acland is not party to the submission no more than the Mariners, and that the
other parties have submitted by him. 2ly. He said there is something awarded
for John Ackland, for he is comprised within the Mariners, and so he has
satisfaction, and if he be not included, then it appears not that there is any
difference touching him to be arbitrated, and here is a joint trust for all,
and one may take upon him for all, and make a discharge for all. Roll chief
Justice said, the Mariners, and owners of the Ship are all parties to the
submission; but the Plaintiff and Defendant in this action are only bound to
perform the Award, for they only entered into bond to do it. And the Master of
the Ship is the chief Mariner, Award.
and he comes in in this notion and so the Award concerns him, 7 E. 4. f. 14.
And if the party have power by the Award either in Law or Equity to compel the
other to perform it, the Award is good though the party be put to his Action to
get it performed. Bacon Justice agreed with Roll, and held Judgment ought to
be given for the Plaintiff, for that all the parties are included within the
submission, although but some of them only are bound to perform the Award, and
he said that the Master of the Ship is a Mariner. Ierman Justice said, he would
advise, because it was a great cause, but he inclined that judgment was to be
given for the Plaintiff, because the Award seemed upon the pleading to be good.
Brown Justice was of the same opinion, and said, that the Master was a Mariner,
and that there is a trust between all the parties, and a good remedy for them
all by the Award. Whereupon the rule was, that the Plaintiff should have
Judgment except better matter were shown Monday next.

Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Plaintiff brought an Action upon the Case upon a promise; The Defendant
pleaded non Assumpsit, Arrest of judgment in an action up on the Case upon a
promise.
and thereupon an issue was joined, and a verdict found for the Plaintiff. The
Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, and took exception to the setting forth
of the promise, which was this, that the Defendant upon a consideration moving
from the Plaintiff, did assume and promise unto the Plaintiff to pay a certain
sum of money cuidam Fountain, and leaves out his name of baptism, and so it is
uncertain who the money should be paid unto, or whether it he now paid or no,
and consequently whether there be any cause of Action, and so there can be no
Judgment. But Roll chief Justice answered, Assumpsit.
the Assumpsit was grounded upon a consideration past, and peradventure the
Plaintiff may not know the parties Christian-name to whom the money is to be
paid, though both the Plaintiff and Defendant know the person of the man well
enough. Therefore let the Plaintiff have his Judgment.

Frank against Dixon.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
FRank brought an Action of Trespass against Dixon for entering into his House
and breaking open his Chest, and taking away his Goods. Arrest of Judgment in
an action of Trespass.
The Defendant pleaded a special Plea, viz. that he did it by way of a distress
for rent due unto him; The Plaintiff replied de injuria sua propria absque tali
causa; upon this an Issue was joined, and a verdict found for the Plaintiff. It
was moved at amicus Curiae that no Judgment could be here given for Costs for
the Plaintiff, because the Plaintiff had made no title to the Goods, Costs.
and these Cases were cited, 44 Eliz. Trin. 7 Iac. Frith and Blackmans Case,
and 5 Car. Davis and Evans. But Roll chief Justice answered, that he wondered
why any body should so move, for it is against the known practice of the Court,
and said that he must pay Costs, otherwise there shall be vexation without
amends. Therefore let the Plaintiff take his judgment.

Tyson.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in an Action of
Trespass, and exception was taken to the Writ of Error, Error to reverse a
judgment in Trespass.
in that it was not brought by the same person against whom the judgment was
given: for the judgment was given against Evison, with the addition of
Gentleman, and the Writ of Error is brought by Ivison Yeoman. Addition.
Roll chief Justice answered, that Evison and Ivison sounded but as one and the
same name, and for the additions of Yeoman and Gentleman it is not material,
though they differ here: but if it were the addition of Knight, or Baronet,
there the difference would be something, for that is made part of the name, but
the additions of Yeoman or Gentleman are additions ad placitum.

for an Assault and Battery, and against the other, for taking away his Goods,
and upon not guilty pleaded the Plaintiff had a verdict, and a judgment against
them both jointly for damages, and this was assigned for error to reverse the
Judgment. Roll chief Justice said, the Writ cannot be helped, for the two
Defendants cannot be joined in one Action, Ioyn in action.
because the Trespasses are of several natures, and against several persons,
and the parties cannot plead to this Declaration. Therefore the Plaintiff nil
capiat per billam.

A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a judgment given in the Court at
Exeter in an Action of Debt for rent. Error to reverse a judgment in Debt.
The errors assigned were, 1. That the names of the Jurors were not returned
upon the panel. To this Roll chief Justice answered, it is not necessary to
retorn their names, though it was the old way to do so. Retorn.
A second exception was, that the Writ of Error is not well returned, for it is
directed to the Mayor and Bailifs of the City of Exeter, and it is returned by
the Mayor and two of the Baylifs, whereas it should be by all of them.

The King against Humphryes.
Mich. 24 Car. Banc. Reg.
THe Court was moved to quash an order of Sessions made at Derby for Parents to
relieve their poor Children. To quash an order of Sessions. Deputation.
The exception taken was that the Statute appoints that the Justices in the
Sessions shall set the rate that is to be paid for their maintenance, and that
the Justices here have not done, but have transferred their authority over to
other Justices to do it, which they cannot do, and so the order made by the
other Justices is not good. The Court said, this is all one as if an Arbitrator
should arbitrate another to make the arbitrament, which is not good. Therefore
let the order be quashed.

and comparing it with the Declarations in the causes between Bows and
Broadhead, and Burraston and Herbert, it was found that the Statute was rightly
recited, notwithstanding what had been objected, and the Iournal Book of
Parliament produced to the contrary; and thereupon Judgment was given in both
cases, and the Court said that they were to be ruled by the Parliament Roll,
and not the Iournal book. And the same day, in the Case between Bowyer and
Tantulyar, for the same reason, the Court ordered the Parliament Roll to be
brought in Court the next term, to make it appear whether an adjournment of
Parliament was well recited, and would not credit the Iournal book.

the house of the Baron, and he took these exceptions. 1. That the Endictment
did conclude ad damnum ipsorum, whereas it should be ad damnum of the Baron
only. But the Court answered, that the Endictment is good, though the words ad
damnum ipsorum be left out. A second Exception was, that the Endictment does
not show the time, and place, when the Assault was committed. 3ly. It is said
intulit and expulsit in the singular number, Endictment.
whereas it should be intulerunt and expulserunt in the Plural number, because
the Endictment is against diverse, and so it is false Latin. 4ly. False Latin.
The Endictment uses the word lignum for the timber of the house, whereas it
should be maremium. Twisden on the other side answered, that the Endictment was
good at least to the Assault and Battery, though it fail in the other
particulars. The Court ordered the Defendants to plead to it, and would not
quash it.

by the Plaintifs, did assume and promise unto them to procure the Cattle to be
re-delivered unto them, and because they were not re-delivered acordingly they

Vaux and Vaux against Steward.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
THe Case between Vaux and Vaux, and Steward, Arrest of judgment in an action

was again moved in arrest of Judgment. The objection made was, that the
promise made amounted to a double promise, and therefore the parties to whom
the promise was made ought to have brought several Actions, and not to have
joined in the Action, as they have done. But to this it was answered by the
Council on the Plaintifs part, that the promise is entire, and is not double:
for the consideration of the promise is entire, viz. the ten pound which moved
from them jointly and not severally. Roll chief Justice held. Joint promise.
that it is an entire promise, and a joint consideration, though the Cattle
taken were several, and therefore the Action may be joint, and if one lay out
money for a thing assumed to be done for a third person, if it be not done an
Action shall be brought upon the Assumpsit by him who laid out the money; Rippon

An Estople supposes a thing to be done; and therefore if the thing be
impossible which is alleged by way of estople, it can be no estople. And one

by it he may do no wrong. Brooks Abridgement Grants 49. Roll chief Justice,
The matter here is not how the estates shall pass, and how to make them good;
but the Question is upon the forfeiture: Forfeiture.
for he levies the fine as of an estate in possession, and not of a reversion
in fee; and this is not upon the rule in Bredons case, 13 Car. Sir Julius
Caesar's case; an Acceptance of an estate, or an Attornment by Tenant for life
to a stranger, is a forfeiture. Jerman Justice held there was no forfeiture.
But the Court said the Verdict was ill sound: and therefore ordered it should
be amended, that the whole matter in Law might come in question. Amendment.

he durst not show his face hereabouts. The Plaintiff had a Verdict; and the
Defendant moved in Arrest of Judgment, that the words were not actionable,
because they were general and uncertain words, and it does not appear the party
was damnified by them, nor how long ago they were spoken. Roll chief Justice
said, that the party was defamed by speaking of them, and he has laid it that
he lost his Credit thereby. Therefore let the Plaintiff have his Judgment,

That a writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment, and that it was
received and allowed: and notwithstanding the Plaintiff that had the Judgment
had taken out execution; and thereupon it was prayed for a supersedeas to
supersede the execution, and for an Attachment against the party for his
contempt to the Court. And it was urged by the Council that moved, That after a
writ of Error is received and allowed, the hands of the Court that gave the
Judgment, are foreclosed from granting out execution, and that the writ of
Error is in it self a Supersedeas, and cited Dyer 283. and therefore concluded,
that the execution is not well issued forth. Twisden of Council on the other
side said, that the writ of Error was not duly pursued, because the roll was
not marked; and therefore the party might well take out execution. But Roll
chief Justice answered, that the writ was well pursued, though the roll were
not marked; Yet if neither the roll be marked, Notice.
nor notice given to the Attorney on the other side of the bringing the writ of
Error, if the party proceed to take out execution, it is no contempt to the

Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
Hill. 24 Car. rot. 1062.
IN an Ejectione firmae brought for the Manor of Caledown, Argument upon a
special verdict in an Ejectione firmae.
The Defendant pleads Not guilty; and upon this the Jury find a special verdict
to this effect, That Sir Thomas Morgan was seized in fee, amongst other lands,
of the lands in question, and that in 13 Car. he made a settlement of these
lands to himself for life, the remainder to his daughter Mary for life, the
remainder to the heirs of the first Tenant for life, with a power of
revocation, to alter all or any part of the settlement made at any time during
his life: The verdict finds further, that there was an Ordinance of Parliament
made in the year of our Lord, 1645. that Sir Thomas Morgan should forfeit all
his lands and estate which he was then seized or possessed of, or had been
seized or possessed of from the year 1641. and that by the same Ordinance the
lands in question were given to Mr. Pym; and that by virtue of the said
Ordinance he encred and was seized pro ut; and that Mr. Pym died so seized,
after whose death the Plaintifs lessor, as his heir, entered, and made a lease
to the Plaintiff, and after that Sir Tho Morgan died. and Mary the Defendant
claiming as tenant in remainder for life after the death of Sir Thomas her
father, by virtue of the settlement made 13 Carol. entered into the lands in
question, and the Plaintiff as lessee of Pym brings the action. Upon this
special verdict, the Question was, Whether by the Ordinance of Parliament made
not till the year 1645. yet looking back to the year 1641. the remainder of the
lands in question, which was settled 13 Car. being before the making of the
Ordinance, and also before the time to which the Ordinance looks back, be
forfeited by the Ordinance or not? Forfeiture.
Latch of Council with the Defendant argued That it was not forfeited; 1.
Because that the Ordinance is penal, and retrospective or looking back; and
therefore it is odious in Law, and shall not be largely interpreted but as
strictly as may be. 2ly, The preamble of the Ordinance sets forth 2. things, as
the reasons why the Ordinance was made; 1. Mr. Pyms deserts, to whom the lands
were given; 2ly, Morgans offenses, for which he was thus punished: and both
these grounds for making the Ordinance can extend no further than to the year
1641. and so not to the time of the settlement made 13 Car. by Sir Thomas
Morgan; for then neither of these causes alleged were in being; 2ly, The
purview of the Ordinance is double; 1. punitive: 2ly, remunerative. 1. the
punitive part, which concerns the punishing of Sir Thomas Morgan: 2ly, the
remunerative part, concerning the rewarding of Mr. Pym; and the punitiue part
made in the year 1645. cannot reach the estate settled upon Mary his daughter so
long before, viz. 13 Car. for it can reach no further back than to the year
1641. at the most to which time, and no further, the Ordinance is
retrospective: and in the Statute of 23 H. 8. general words of an Act are
restrained. Besides, there is a demonstration in the Ordinance, that shows the
Ordinance does not extend to the estate of the Defendant, as may appear by the
provisoes contained in it; for although the children of Morgan are to be
punished within the Ordinance by the second proviso of it, yet this extends not
to so long time as to 13 Car. when the estate was settled, but only to the
estate, as it was in the year 1641. And therefore prayed Judgment for the
Defendant. Wadham Windham on the other side argued, that the estate of Morgan,
though it was said to be settled 13 Car. was forseited by the Ordinance. Because
the estate was not absolutely settled at that time, for there was a proviso in
the conveyance to revoke the settlement, so that at the time of the Ordinance
made the estate was in Sir Thomas Morgan absolutely to dispose off as he
pleased, and by the words of the Ordinance all Morgans estate is passed without
any saving, and the provisoes of the Ordinance do prove, that the Children of
Sir Thomas Morgan were excepted out of the savings made to preserve the estates
of others. Also Boons and Favors bestowed use to be amply expounded, and this
being a Boon bestowed by the Parliament shall receive as large a construction
as is possible. Besides Morgan was a Papist, and therefore it may well be
supposed, that he intended not this for any real settlement, but only by way of
subtility for some private reasons: for we know that Papists do use to make
such settlements as this was to preserve them from penalties of the Law. And
the words of the Ordinance are accumulative to convey all Morgans estate, and
there are no restrictive words, and if there were they should be void here: for
the Manor of Callidown, being the Lands in question are expressly given by the
Ordinance, and as to these Lands the rights of all men are bound, and therefore
if there were a saving it would be void, as it is Cook rep. Alton Woods Case.
And an act of Parliament sometimes is as a conveyance, sometime as a judgment,
and both ways a saving in it is void and srivolous, 1 Rep. 4. A conditional
estate or a right may be saved by Judgment or fine, but not an entire estate or
interest, Saving.
and therefore the estate of Mary in the Manor of Callidown, cannot be saved by
any proviso, and he cited Alton Woods Case for authority in the principal Case,
f. 51. But admitting a general saving had been good to save Mary's estate, yet
as the words of the Ordinance were penned, her estate is not saved by it, for
the words were put in the Ordinance for the advantage of Pym, and not to
provide for Mary: for she claims from Thomas Morgan, and so prayed Judgment
for the Plaintiff. Roll chief Justice said, that the provisoes in the Ordinance
are not void to all persons, as Windham argued, for Strangers are clearly
provided for by them. But let the Case be argued again Saturday fortnight.
Postea.

Hatwood against Payte.
Mich. 1649 Banc. sup.
Entered Hill. 24 Car. rot. 78.
THe question insisted upon in this Case was, Whether Tithes be extendible upon
an Elegit.
whether upon a recovery in an Action of Debt against a Parson, the Tithes be
extendible by Elegit. Hales of Council with the Plaintiff held, that they are,
because that Tithes may be said to be Tenements, and the Parson has a
Freehold in them, although he hold them jure Ecclesiae. But Roll chief Justice
said, Elegit.
that a Parsonage cannot be extended, but that the Debt may be levied out of
the profits of it by the Sherif, as it was wont to be done: Extent.
for now there being no Bishops the profits cannot be sequestered by the Bishop
of the Dioces, Sequestration
as they used to be. But Ierman and Nicholas Justices doubted. Clergy.
Ask Justice agreed with Roll, and said, that by the Common Law the Clergy are
no more privileged from paying their debts, than Lay men are. Roll chief
Justice said, it has been heretofore questioned, whether a Clergyman be
subject to watch and ward, or to contribute to satisfy for a robbery done
within the Hundred: but now it is no question but they are subject, and shall
contribute. Adjourned till Saturday to be argued again. Postea.

Tyndal and others against Harington.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
TYndal brought an Action of Debt against Harington for arrerages of rent due
to him as Lessee of a Vicarage, Arrest of judgment in Debt for arrerages of an
annuity. Debt. Annuity.
and upon nil debet pleaded, there was an Issue joined, and a verdict found for
the Plaintiff. The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, that an Action of
Debt did not lie, but that he ought to have brought a Writ of Annuity, because
it was for arrerages of an Annuity, which yet continnes, and 6 H. 4.7. and 9 H.
6.94. were cited. The Judgment was arrested till the Plaintiff should move.

Compton against Allen.
Mich 1649. Banc. sup.
Entered Trin. 1649. rot. 348.
COmpton brought an Action of Covenant against Allen his Lessee for years upon
a Covenant of the Indenture, Demurrer upon a Plea in an action of Covenant.
for not keeping the House let unto him in repair. The Defendant pleads, that
the House was burnt by casualty. The Plaintiff demurs to this Plea, and for
cause shows, that the Plea was contrary to the Defendants express Covenant by
his Deed, and therefore was not good. Roll chief Justice said, that a Lessee
that covenanteth to repair, Covenant.
ought to do it if the House be burnt, be it by negligence, or by other means.
Therefore let the Plaint if have Judgment except cause showed to the contrary.

-- against Phillips.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
AN Action upon the Case was brought against Phillips for suffering one to
escape; Arrest of judgment in an action upon the Case. Escape.
The Plaintiff had a verdict; The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, and
for cause shows, that the Declaration was insufficient. For 1. it shows, that
the party was arrested that made the escape, but it does not show by what
process he was arrested. 2ly. The Declaration says, that he was arrested
virtute Querelae, which cannot be: for he is arrested by virtue of the Writ,
and not of the Plaint. 3ly. The Declaration does not show by what authority the
Prison was kept, out of which the escape was made. Escape.
Roll chief Justice said, that the second exception was material, and then if
the party be not well arrested, there can be no escape, and so the Action lies
not. Therefore nil capiat per billam, if cause be not showed to the contrary.

Johnson against Abington.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
Johnson brought an Action of the Case against Abington, and declared, Arrest
of judgment in an action upon an Assumpsit.
that the Defendant in consideration that the Plaintiff would deliver unto the
Defendants Son such wares as his Son should desire, did assume and promise unto
the Plaintiff that he would pay the Plaintiff for them, and avers that he had
delivered certain wares unto his Son, and that the Defendant did refuse to pay
for them, and for this he brought his Action. The Defendant pleads non
Assumpsit, and upon this an Issue is joined, and a verdict found for the
Plaintiff. The Defendant moved in arrest of judgment, and for cause shows, that
it does not appear, Averment
that the Son of the Defendant did desire the Goods that the Plaintiff delivered
unto him, and for which he brings his Action, and the Assumpsit being to pay
for such as his Son should desire, the Declaration ought to set forth an actual
desire of the Son, to have the wares delivered. But Twisden of Council with the
Plaintiff answered, that the delivery of the commodities by the Plaintiff, and
the acceptance of them by the Defendant employed a desire, and it is not
necessary to show an actual desire. Ierman Justice said, there ought at least
to be a verbal desire. But Roll chief Justice said, that the acceptance of the
wares is an actual desire, and that is more than a verbal desire, Declaration.
Assumpsit.
and it is not necessary here to affirm the punctual words of the promise: but
only the substance of it. And therefore let the Plaintiff have his Judgment, if
better matter be not showed.

Mich. 1649 Banc. sup.
Walker moved to quash an endictment against the Inhabitants of Mile-end, To
quash an Endictment.
within the Parish of Stebenhoth for not repairing the high way, and to take
off the issues upon a Certificate read, that the way was repaired, and upon
this exception taken to the Endictment, viz. that the Inhabitants of Mile-end
within the Parish of Stebenhoth are endicted, and Mile-end is but a Hamlet
within a Parish, and a Hamlet within a Parish cannot be charged to repair a
high way, except it be by prescription, or for some other special reason: for
of common right the whole Parish is charged with it; Common right. High way.
and here is no such prescription or particular reason showed in the
Endictment, and therefore it is not good. Roll chief Justice answered, that of
common right a Hamlet is not so charged, but a vill is; and therefore let it be
quashed, but the issues shall stand: for few will repair the high way till they
be forced.

Fines against Dell.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
FInes brought an Action of Debt upon an Obligation to perform certain
Covenants contained in an Indenture. Demurrer to a Plea in Debt upon an
Obligation to perform Covenants. Plea.
The Defendant pleads performance generally; The Plaintiff demurs to the plea,
and for cause shows, that diverse Covenants are comprised in the Indenture, and
that some of them are in the Affirmative; and others of them are in the
Negative, and therefore a general pleading of performance to all is not
sufficient: for as to the Covenants in the Affirmative he ought to plead a
special performance, and to show how he has performed them. The Court bid the
Plaintiff take his judgment, except cause be showed to the contrary.

Mich 1649. Banc. sup.
THe Court was moved that there might be a rule of Court for the party upon
satisfaction made of a judgment obtained by him, For a rule to: acknowledge,

trick in the business; For no doubt but the party upon receipt of what is due
to him will acknowledge satisfaction without a rule to compel him.

Crible against Orchard.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
Entered Trin. 1649. rot. 30.
ORchard brought an action of debt against CRible upon an Obligation, Error
upon a judgment in debt upon an Obligation.
the Defendant pleaded per minas; upon this an issue was joined, and a Verdict
and a Judgment given in the Court at Barnstaple for the Plaintiff, and upon a
Writ of Error brought three Errors were assigned: 1. That the Declaration was
insufficient. 2ly. The Common Error. 3ly. That the Venire was not good; but
these were overruled. And Roll chief Justice upon Oyer of the Record found
this Error, That the Jury in the assessing of damages say pro missis and
Custagiis, etc. but do not not say circa sectam et expenditis, Damages.
Judgment.
and so it cannot appear for what the costs and damages are assessed, and said,
It is true that the judgment is right entered; but there is no Verdict to
warrant the Judgment, and therefore it cannot be good, and therefore let it be
reversed if cause be not shown to the contrary. But we will not pronounce it
now except the party desire it for his own expedition.

Air against Pyncomb.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
Air brought an Action upon the Case against Pymcomb for surcharging of a
Common, and for treading the Grass: Arrest of Judgment in an Action upon the
case for surcharging a Common. Assize. Trespass upon the case.
The Plaintiff had a Verdict: The Defendant moved in Arrest of Judgment, That
an Action of the Case does not lie in this case, but an Assize. 2ly. That an
Action of Trespass does not lie for a Commoner for treading of the Grass. 3ly.
The Trespass is alleged to be done in quibusdam peciis pasturae, and the
quantity of them is not showed. To the first Exception Roll chief Justice
answered, That the Plaintiff may have an Assize or an Action upon the Case at
his election, although here be a disturbance of the Plaintifs freehold,
although that the ancient books say the contrary: And thereupon the Court gave
Judgment for the Plaintiff, except cause shown to the contrary.

A Judgment given in an Action of Debt upon an account in the Court of
Knaresborough was reversed here, Judgment in an account reversed for Error in
it.
because the Venire facias was Venire facias, etc. which in an Inferior Court
is not good, Venire.
but it ought to say Venire facias duodecem probos et legales homines de, etc.
and so express all at large in words, and not with an, etc. Note, Many
Judgments given in Inferior Courts have been here reversed upon the same
exception: But I only mention this for an authority to be cited upon occasion.

IBson brought a Writ of Error to reverse a Judgment given against him for
Beale in the Court at York, in an Action of Debt upon an Obligation, Error to
reverse a Judgment in debt.
and assigned for Errors. 1. That the party has not entitled himself to the
Action. 2ly. The issue is not well joined; for the Plaintiff says, ideo ponit

petit quod inquiratur per patriam. 3ly. He concludes, to his damage of l. 1.
(i.) fifty pounds expressed in numerical Letters, viz. l. for fifty, and L. for

A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in the Court at

But Roll chief Justice upon Oyer of the Record took this exception, That the
Record was ideo praeceptum est Vicecomiti, and it is not said in Curia, and so
it does not appear to be the Process of the Court; And for this Error the
Judgment was reversed. Venire.


Topladye against Stalye.
Mich. 2649 Banc. sup.
Mich. 24 Car. rot. 596.
TOpladye brought an Action of Trespass quare clausum fregit and pedibus
ambulando etc. against Stalye: Demtirrer and argument upon a plea in Trespass.
The Defendant makes a special justification, That he did enter into the
Plaintifs Close to search for Sheep that were stolen from him. To this Plea
the Plaintiff demurred, and for cause shows that the justification is not good,
for it is not said by the Defendant that the Plaintiff had stolen the Sheep, or
that he had any suspicion that he had stolen them, or that any other had
stolen them and driven them upon the Plaintifs land, and so had no color to
come there to search for them, and the Books of 17 E. 4. f. 1. and 27 H. 8.23.
and 6 E. 4.7. and 21 H. 7. f. 10. and 22 H. 6. f. 36. and 38 E. 3. f. 10. were
cited. Justification.
Another exception was also taken, That the Defendant does not say that the
Gate of the Close where he entered was open; and though he may justify to
search for his Sheep in the Close, yet he cannot justify the breaking of his
Close to do it. But Roll chief Justice overruled this exception: And for the
matter in Law, whether the Defendant had made a good justification or no. He
held that he had not, for all that he has alleged by way of Justification is
but matter of private profit to himself, Distress. Damage feasant.
and not for the public good; for he went not thither to find or apprehend
the Felon, but to look for his Sheep; And if Cattle be stolen and put into my
ground, I may take them damage feasant, or bring an Action of Trespass against
the owner, and the owner cannot take them away without the license of the
possessor of the ground, License.
for if he might, by that means the possessor of the ground would be without
remedy for the damage the Cattle had done him: And he said, That when one has
suspicion of another for felony, he ought to show the cause of his suspicion,
Arrest.
otherwise the party suspected ought not to be arrested upon it; and concluded
that the Plaintiff ought to have Judgment. Ierman Justice held, that the
Defendant ought to have Judgment, because a private injury as this Trespass
is, ought to give way to the public good, viz. the discovery of Felony; and
here is a public good intended, and it ought to take place of the Plaintifs
inconsiderable injury. And he said that one may be arrested for Felony only
upon Common fame, if there be a felony committed: Otherwise it is if there be
no Felony done. Ask Justice said the Case was hard on both sides. But the Court
gave Judgment for the Plaintiff except cause should be shown to the contrary.

Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
VVIld moved the Court that the retorn of a Habeas Corpus granted for certain
rioters called the Diggers that were committed by Justices of Peace upon
finding the Riot upon their view might be filed, To quash a Retorn of a Rescous.
which was granted, upon which he moved that the prisoners might be discharged,
but the Court commanded the retorn to be read, upon the reading of it Wild took
this exception, viz. That the prisoners were committed contrary to the Statute
of H. 4. c. 7. for by that Statute the Sherif ought to be present at the
finding of the Riot, which was not so here. Walker held that the Justices had
power by the Statute without the Sherif to enquire of the Riot, and to commit
the Rioters. But Roll chief Justice said, that there is no enquiry made in this
case, for the Riot is found upon the view, View. Record.
and so there needs no enquiry, and the Record ought to be made up by the two
Justices that had the view, and by the Sherif, and it is not made by them as
Justices but as Judges joined with the Sherif by the Statute, and Justices that
find a Riot may either bring in the Record in Court propriis manibus of their
own accord, or may send it into Court, as they have done here. The prisoners
committed upon the first Record read (for there were two here read in Court)
were bailed but not discharged, Discharge.
although the retorn was not good, because the Court said it was not usual to
discharge prisoners at the first reading of the retorn; For the other
prisoners, The Court advised.

Bendir against Oil.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup. For a Prohibition to the Court of Policy of assurance.

A Prohibition was prayed to the Court of the Commissioners of policy for
assurance upon a surmise that they proceeded there in the trial of the
Assurance of a man's life, which was said to be tryable at the Common law, as it
was before the Statute made that erected that Court, Assurance.
as may appear by the preamble of the Statute. Roll chief Justice said, that
the Assurance of the life of a man is not within the Statute of Assurance, as
the Assurance of a man's life upon the buying of an office; but this case is
different, for the man whose life is here assured is going to sea upon
Merchants affairs, and his life may be as well assured, as the safe return of
the ship he goes in. But let Council be heard on both sides Wednesday next; but
we will stay nothing in the interim. Postea.

the Record might be amended before Judgment entered, Amendment.
that the Judgment may not be erroneous by reason of this mistake. The Court
answered, Bring a Copy of the Record to us to advise upon; Issue.

Hobbs against Blanchard.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
Pasch. 20 Car. rot. 220.
BLanchard brought an action of Trespass in the Court at Norwitch against Hobbs,
and had a verdict and a judgment. Error to reverse a judgment in trespass.
The Defendant brought a writ of Error to reverse the judgment. The error
assigned was, that the Jury had not found the issue joined; for the issue
joined is, de injuria sua propria absque tali causa, and the Jury have found
not guilty generally. Panel of Council with the Defendant in the writ of Error
said, that the Jury have found the effect of the issue, though they have not
found the very words, and therefore it is good enough, and he cited Fabian and
Kingstons case, 32 Eliz. and Wingrave and Homes his case 3 Car. entered 2 Car.
rot. 632. Roll chief Justice answered, That the verdict found the issue
argumentatively only, and not directly; and therefore it is not good. Verdict.
Ierman Justice was of the same opinion: and the Judgment was reversed, except
better cause shown.

Carew against Bawd.

Trin. 24 Car. rot. 1607.
CArew brought an Action of trespass against Bawd for entering into his ground,
and taking away a certain parcel of Tynn. Demurrer to a plea of privilege of
Parl. in an action of trespass.
The Defendant pleaded that he was servant unto the Lord Moon, who was a Lord
of the Parliament, and that he took the Tynn by his Command, and claims his
privilege as his servant, not to be impleaded: to this plea the Plaintiff
demurrs, and for cause shows, that the Defendant does not show that he was the
Lord Moons menial servant, Privilege.
and attending upon his person: and it may be he was his Carter or Plowman, and
such servants are not privileged. Roll chief Justice said, The privilege is not
claimed here merely as his servant; but he justifies here as his servant in
defense of his Masters title to the Tynn, Waiver.
which he took by his command. But let the Defendant plead in Chief, and let
the Plaintiff waive the Demurrer: Or else let the Plaintiff enter his suggestion
upon the roll, that the House of Lords is now dissolved, and so let them take
issue and go to trial: Or else let the party plead what he will upon record,
and we will advise in the mean time.

Paroch. de Hardingham versus Paroch. de Brisley.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
AN order of Sessions made for the settling of a poor woman in the parish of
Hardingham was returned hither by a Certiorari granted to the said parish, For
quashing an Order of Sessions for the settling of a Vagrant.
and upon the return read, and opening the matter by Council, the case was
this. An inhabitant dwelling within the parish of Brisley, did hire a maid
servant for a year, and Covenanted to give her Forty shillings for her wages,
and entertained her into his service. The maid servant some time after fell
sick in his service; her Master thereupon turns her out of his service, without
giving her any thing: the maid, for necessity, in traveling from Brisley
toward Hardingham where her friends lived, and where she was born, was forced
to beg for relief: whereupon she was sent as a Vagrant to Hardingham, where she
was born. The Vill of Hardingham send her back to Brisley, where she was
entertained as a Covenant servant: whereupon they of Brisley procure an order
of Sessions to settle her at Hardingham. The Question was, Whether this were a
good order, or not, for settling her at Hardingham according to the Statute? Or,
whether she ought to be settled at Brisley, where she was entertained as a
Covenant servant and turned out of service, and forced to beg by that means.
Roll chief Justice said, That here seems to be fraudulency in the Master to
make his servant a Vagrant, Vagrant.
that so he may be rid of her; but if one beg meat and drink, for necessity,
in passing between one Town and another, this is not begging to make one a
beggar within the Statute. And therefore the Court ordered that the party
should be settled at Brisley, Setlement.
where she was entertained for a Covenant servant, and not at Hardingham where
she was born, if cause were not shown to the contrary.

Harwood against Paty.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
THe case between Harwood and Patye was again spoken unto, Argument in
trespass, whether Tithes be extendible.
by Wild of Council with the Plaintiff, wherein the Action being an Action of
Trespass for taking away wheat, rye, and wood, upon an Elegit taken out against
a Parson, The Question was. Whether Tithes are extendible upon an Elegit by the
Statute, or not? And he held that they are not extendible, first by the Common
law confirmed by Mag. Charta they are not extendible. Extent.
Cook upon Magna Charta, 37 and N. Brev. 227. Tithes are merely Spiritual
things, and exempt from all Lay consideration, 11 Rep. 14. Pridle and Nappers
case. Cawdries case, 5 Rep. f. 15.35 H. 6.39. where rights of Tithes are in
dispute, the Common Law shall take place; but not where the Tithes themselves
are in dispute: Seldens History of Tithes, cap. 14. 2ly, The Statute of
Westminster makes no alteration of the Common law in this point, and non usage
is a good argument to prove it; for if they had been extendible, it would
sometime or other have been put in practice; and by the express words of the
Statute of Westminster, the 2d. Tithes are excepted, and the process usually
before that directed to the Bishop for sequestration, is not taken away by the
Statute of 5 Ed. 3.53. N. Brev. 66. Though it be a freehold, yet is it not
within the Statute; and if it be within the words of the Statute, yet is it not
within the meaning of it, as Cook upon the Stat. of Wesim. 2. does prove, 35 H.
5.50. 9 E. 2. Clergy men anciently were not included in general Acts of
Parliaments, because the Church was accounted as an Infant always within age,
Clergy.
and so favored and protected by Law. Next the late Ordinance of Parliament
has made no alteration in this case; for the Ordinance intended not to punish
the Parsons of Churches, although it do out Bishops of their Bishoprics and
dignities. And as to the Objection, That if the Tithes should not be here
extendible, there would be a failer of justice. I answer, That our case is out
of the Common law, upon which, the rule, that extraordinary courses are to be
taken, rather than there should be a failer of Justice, is grounded. Roll chief
Justice said, that there are two Questions in this case, 1. Whether Tithes are
within the Statute? 2ly, Whether now that Bishops are taken away by the
Parliament, the Sherifs may levy the debt of the Clergy as the Bishops used to
do? and I conceive they may, Levari.
by a levari facias. But the great question is, Whether the Elegit lie? And the
Court inclined it did. But you will argue it again, therefore we will deliver
no opinion in it. Elegit.
And the Court clearly held with Mr. Seldom, That Tithes are not due jure
divino; and directed to search presidents, Tithes.
if a Recognisance had ever been extended upon Tithes.

Cane against Golding.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
CAne brought an Action upon the case against Golding for slandring his title,
by speaking these words, viz. His right and title thereunto is naught, Arrest
of Judgment in an action upon the case, for slandering the Plaintifs title.
and I have a better title than he. The Plaintiff had a verdict. The Defendant
moved in Arrest of Judgment, that the words were not actionable. Twisden of
Council with the Plaintiff argued that the words are actionable; for though the
words spoken of themselves may not be actionable, yet here they are alleged to

33. N. Br. 95. Hob. Rep. Water and Freemans Case; and as to the Objection that
is made, that the Declaration is only quod fuit verisimilis vendere, and that
he was hindered by the words; and therefore there might have been no bargain
made, though the words had not been spoken: The answer is, That it is well
enough set forth as it is; for all treaties upon Contracts are but likely to
proceed, and are not certain till the Contracts be made; but which is more, it
is further alleged here, that by reason of the speaking of these words he could
not receive his Tithes, which is an express loss. Hales for the Defendant
argued, that the words of themselves are not actionable, although they be said
to be spoken falso et malitiose, except a special damage be alleged to come to
the party; for such words as these differ from words that are spoken of the
person of a man: And though there be damage, yet they are not scandalous; for
the Defendant claims a title as well as the Plaintiff: and the saying that the
words were spoken falso and malitiose, does not make them to be so spoken, nor
makes them actionable, if they be not so in themselves. Roll chief Justice
said, there ought to be a scandal and a particular damage set forth; but it is
not so here. But move it again Saturday next. Postea.

White against Holford.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
Trin. 1649. rot. 1214.
A Writ of Error was brought upon a Judgment given in an Action of Debt upon
an Obligation to stand to an Award, and the Error assigned was, Error to
reverse a judgment in Debt upon an Obligation.
that the Arbitrament exceeded the submission; for the submission was to stand
to the award touching all matters in difference between the parties, and the
award was, that the parties shall make general releases each to other of all
demands; and the word demands, is a word of a larger signification than the
word differences. Award.
But Roll chief Justice answered, That if the release be more large in words,
yet it is good enough: for it shall be intended only of all matters in debate
between the parties, and if there be other matters, you ought to have shown
them in pleading, otherwise the Court will not intend there are any; to which
the other Judges agreed, and gave judgment for the Plaintiff, except better
matter should be shown.

Brook against Brook.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
Mich. 24 Car. rot. 287.
BRook brought an action of trespass quare clausum fregit, and for eating of
his grass with Cattle, Error to reverse a judgment in trespass, quare clausum
fregit.
etc. against Brook: Upon Not guilty pleaded, an issue was joined, and the
Plaintiff had a verdict and a judgment. The Defendant brought a writ of Error
to reverse this Judgment, and assigned for Error, that the Declaration was
uncertain; For the Plaintiff declares of breaking his Close, and eating his
grass, cum quibusdam averiis, and does not say what Cattle; and so he may
recover damages in this action, and bring another action for the same trespass,
because it cannot be known what Cattle did the former trespass. Bar. Averment.
Hales of Council with the Defendant, said the Declaration was good enough; for
it is good in substance, although it might have been better in form, and it
being after a verdict, the incertainty is helped. And the Defendant, if the
Plaintiff should bring a new action for this trespass, may plead by averment
that he has satisfied the trespass don already, and aver with what Cattle it
was done. Jerman Justice said, the beasts ought to be named particularly; for
averia is a large word, and signifies cattle of diverse kinds; and it is too
general a word to declare upon. But Roll chief Justice answered, where the
thing it self is in demand, and an action is brought for it, as it is in an
action of trover and conversion, the thing ought to be particularly named; but
here the action is brought for damages for breaking his Close, and eating his
grass. And if you had demurred to the Declaration, Demurrer.
it had not been a good Demurrer; but now it is after a Verdict which makes it
stronger against the Defendant. Nicholas and Ask Justices concurred with Roll,
so the Judgment was affirmed.

for a contempt to the Court in a suit depending there betwixt him and another.
Roll chief Justice answered, if the cause were maritine which was depending,
there the Court may examine a contempt to the Court in that cause, but they
cannot proceed criminally against the party that rescued him that did the
contempt. Therefore give them notice that they show cause why we should not

Ireland against Michelborn.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
Entered Mich. 24 Car. rot. 111.
MIchelborn brought an Action of Trespass against Ireland, Error to reverse a
judgment in Trespass vi et armis.
quare vi et armis clausum suum fregit, and for driving and beating his Cattle;
The Plaintiff had a Judgment; the Defendant brought his writ of Error to
reverse this Judgment. The Errors assigned were, 1. That it appears not by the
Continuando how long the Trespass continued. 2ly. There is a discontinuance to
part of the plea, and a departure also. Discontinuance.
Windham in answer to the first Exception said, that it is diversis diebus et
vicibus, and it is without an usque, and the continuance is but in aggravation
of the Trespass, and the Action it self is for the first Trespass, which is the
original, and the diversis diebus et vicibus shall be intended before the
Action brought. 20 H. 6. f. 15.35 H. 6. s. 4. Hob. rep. 377. and the party may
well enough averr in another Action brought for this Trespass that the Plaintiff
had recovered for it in an action formerly brought, and for the new assignment
he said it was but as a new Declaration. But the Court bid the Defendant in the
writ of Error advise concerning the second exception. Roll chief Justice said,
he believed the case cited out of Hobard was not well printed, but something
left out: for it has been ruled that after a verdict it is good enough to say,
one had imprisoned him for a long time; but here is a Judgment upon a nihil
dicit, which will alter the Case. Ierman Justice said, it was considerable, and
fit to be advised on. Holhead of Council with the Plaintiff in the writ of Error
took another exception, viz. that there was an issue joined as to the beating
of the Cattle, and that is not tried nor continued, and yet damages are given
entire for the chasing and beating of the Cattle.

Harris against Gibbons.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
Pasch. 1649. rot. 303.
GIbbons brought an Action upon the Case against Harris upon an Assumpsit,
Error to reverse a judgment in an Action on the Case.
and declared that the Defendant, in consideration that the Plaintiff should let
unto the Defendant a Booth in Sturbridge-fair, did assume and promise to pay
the Plaintiff ten pound for the same, and to pay the Plaintiff for all such Wine
and Hops as should be spent in the Booth during the Fair. The Plaintiff had a
Verdict and a Judgment. The Defendant brought a writ of Error to reverse this
Judgment, and assigned this Error, that it did not appear in the Declaration
that the Fair was ended when the Action was brought, and consequently that
there was cause of Action. But Twisden of Council with the Defendant in the
writ of Error said, it shall be intended it was ended; for the standing there
during the Fair is the cause of Action. Declaration Notice.
Roll chief Justice took another exception. That the Declaration does not
express that the Plaintiff gave notice how much Wine and Hops he laid into the
Booth during the Fair, nor that he made any demand of the payment of any sum of
money due, and so the Defendant could not know how much money he should pay,
and therefore the Declaration is not good, because it is too general. Therefore
advise whether you will maintain it or no, and because the Council desired not
to be farther heard in it, the Judgment was reversed.

Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
AN Action of Covenant was brought upon an Indenture for the payment of a
certain sum of money at a certain time. Arrest of Judgment in an action of
Covenant.
The Defendant pleaded payment at the time, and upon this an issue was joined,
and a Verdict found for the Defendant: The Plaintiff moved in arrest of
Judgment, and alleged for cause that the Issue was mis-joyned, because the
place of the payment was not alleged, which is material, and so there can be no
Judgment. Maynard for the Defendant moved for Judgment, and said that the
issue was well joined, and that it was not material to allege the place of
payment, because it is a personal Action, and the place shall be intended where
the Action is brought, 1 E. 5. f. 3. And here he cannot allege an immaterial
place, and so it must necessarily be intended to be where the Action is
brought. Roll chief Justice, If you will argue it put it in the Paper. But
there is a difference between finding the money paid, and the finding it not
paid.

Denoir against Oil.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
Upon a Rule formerly made in this case to show cause why a prohibition should
not be granted to the Court of Policy for assurances. For a Prohibition to the
Court of policy for assurance.
Hales opened the case, as formerly had been done, and prays that there may be
a Prohibition granted, because the party may have remedy here as well as in
that Court, and so this Court ought to be preferred; and the contract here has
no relation to merchandising, and so it does not properly belong to that Court.
Sergeant Glyn of Council with the Defendant prayed that there might be no
prohibition granted, because it has not been known that even such a
prohibition was granted, and he recited the Statute made for assurances of 43
Eliz. and said this Case was within that Statute, and is to be tried by the
Court of Policy, and that this case does properly concern merchandising, and is
within both the Letter and reason of the Law. And by the words of the policy it
appears plainly that the Contract concerns merchandising, and the party ought
not now to suggest the contrary against his own words in the policy. Roll chief
Justice said, the words of the policy are not material, for the words may be
false; and the Contract may be for things not touching merchandising
notwithstanding, and the intent of the Statute is for things merchantable, and
if it appear they be not so, a prohibition ought to be granted. Sergeant Glyn
replied, Prohibition.
that the voyage depended upon the skill of the party, whose life was assured by
the policy, and although the party were indebted, and there were security given
by bail for his debt, to the intent he might go the voyage, yet this is within
the Statute. Roll chief Justice answered, This is a far fetched construction,
and we cannot avoid the granting of a prohibition; but ^raw the suggestion and
deliver it on Monday next, and join issue and try it this term. The Case in
which this prohibition was moved for and granted was this, Denoir and Oil were
baile^ for one Captain Parr (whose life was assured by the policy) in a suit
against him in the Admiralty brought by one Bushel for 100 l. for freight due
by Parr unto him, Assurance.
and upon that Parr having part in a plantation in the Barbados, and a quarter
part in the ship he was to make his voyage, and his life was assured by Denoir
and Oils who were his bail.

For time to plead.
because the Plaintiff had declared against him by the name of Sir Edmund
Plowden Knight, whereas he is by Creation Count Palatine of Nova Albion, and
that is now part of his name, and he must also plead a special plea. Roll chief
Justice answered, he is also called a Count of Ireland, and neither the one nor
the other is part of his name, as is suggested; and therefore if you will plead
in Chief take a weeks time more for it; otherwise plead at your peril; for a
Count Palatine of Nova Albion, or a Count of Ireland, are not additions in

Order was made by the Commissioners to make a view, and to certify the matter

nuisance, and a verdict was given by the Jury upon Articles presented unto them
to enquire of it. This Order of the Commissioners, and the proceedings
thereupon were removed hither by a Certiorari; and these exceptions were taken
upon reading of the return. 1. That it does not appear by what authority the
Commissioners did sit. 2. The presentment made was not good, for it is said
that anciently the river was so and so, and this is uncertain. 3ly. The
presentment is, that they know not when the Mill was made, which is supposed to
be an obstruction; and if the Mill were made beyond time of the memory of man,
the Commissioners have no power to enquire concerning it. Roll chief Justice,
Give notice to the Council for the Commissioners of Sewers to answer the
exceptions Wednesday next.

BIgg brought an Action of Trover and Conversion of a Horse, Writ of Error
brought by the bail.
and had a Verdict and a Judgment. The bail for the Defendant in the Action
brought a writ of Error to reverse this Judgment given against the principal.
The Court was moved to abate the writ: The Court answered, If the writ of Error
be brought upon the principal Judgment it ought to be abated. It has been a
question heretofore, whether a writ of Error brought upon the principal
Judgment, Error.
and also upon the Judgment given against the bail together be good in part,

Entire damages.
The Error assigned was, that for two of the Cowes there was no value declared,
and yet entire damages were given for them all, which was not good. Roll Chief
Justice, This is a Judgment upon a Nihil dicit, and so there is no Verdict to
help it. Postea 136.

Barber against Pomeroy.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
Entered Hill. 24 Car. rot. 595. or 1095.
BArber brought an Action of debt against Pomeroy for arrerages of rent due for
7. years, and for 7. Capons; the Defendant pleaded nil debet; Arrest of
judgment in an action of debt for rent.
upon this an issue was joined, and a verdict found for the Plaintiff; the
Defendant moved in Arrest of Judgment, and took this exception, that the
Plaintiff of his own showing had demanded more than was due, and so ought not to
have Judgment. The Question here was, Whether the Plaintiff might not
relinquish that part which is not due, and have judgment for so much as is
due? Yard of Council with the Plaintiff held that he might, Relinquishment.
and cited Godfryes case, 11 Rep. f. ^5. b. and Hubbards case, 4 Rep. and
prayed for Judgment. Twisden of Council on the other side, prayed judgment
might not be given, and he agreed the cases cited by Yard, and cited other
cases of the same nature, where the Plaintiff may release part, and have
Judgment for the rest. But he said, that here the thing is entire and cannot
be apportioned, for then he shall falsify his own writ, 1 Ed. 4.24. But Roll
chief Justice held, Release. Damages.
that the relinquishing of part is not the falsifying of his own writ, although
the thing demanded be entire; for he may as well release after the writ
brought, as before; and there was no question but he might have released part
before, and he may release where there is an ill demand, as well as where a
demand is good. Jerman Justice held, that Judgment ought not to be given; for
he said, that the reasons of the cases cited, are not like to the reason of
this case; for here the verdict is not given for the same sum which is
demanded, and it does appear that here is an unjust demand, and it is his own
fault: and if the Defendant had demurred upon the Declaration, it would have
been adjudged no good Declaration. But Nicholas and Ask Justices, agreed with
Roll chief Justice, and so judgment was given for the Plaintiff, except better
matter should be shown on Saturday next.

Avery against Kirton.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
Mich. 23. Car. rot. 239.
KIrton brought an Action of trespass against Avery, Error upon a judgment in
trespass.
and declared upon an original, for imprisoning him till he entered into a bond
of 600 l. upon Not guilty pleaded, the Plaintiff had a verdict and a judgment.
The Defendant brought a writ of Error, and upon the Certiorari to remove the
Record, the Record was certified, and in nullo erratum pleaded, but the
original in the Record certified was, that the Defendant kept the Plaintiff in
prison til he entered into 2. bonds of 300 l. a piece, whereas the right
original was till be entered into one bond of 600 l. whereupon the party brought
a new writ of Error, and by that, had the true original certified. The Council
for the Defendant in the writ of Error said, That original after original may
as well be certified before in nullo est erratum pleaded, Certificate.
as afterward; but here the parties are at issue, and the first original is
certified, and issue joined upon that, and there cannot be a new original
certified; and the original here does not agree with the other parts of the
Record, and so cannot support it, and our original certified stands with the
Record, and here is no Certiorari to warrant the original here certified, and
it is a material variance, 3 Iac. Banc. Reg. Cummins case, 9 H. 6. f. 38.
Pasch. 1649. Kedgwins case. Yard on the other side answered, that now the
original is certified, and is before you in this Court, and you ought to judge
as it is, and not as it ought to be; and it is agreeing with the former
process. And both the originals were before the Declaration, and the Court
shall take the right original, and the other shall be intended for another
cause. Roll chief Justice said, The Certiorari is general, and not inter parts
praedict, but the certificate is inter parts praedict. And the Court may take
the right original that is certified, and the Judges are not bound by the plea
in nullo est erratum that is pleaded, but may grant a new original writ of
Error, but the party cannot require it, for he is concluded by his own plea;
Original. Certiorari.
and if he discontinue his original, he may have a new, but not if he plead,
and the Certiorari is good, and well certified, and therefore judgment ought
to be affirmed. Ierman, Nicholas, and Ask to the same effect; and so judgment
was affirmed, except better matter should be showed Saturday next.

Upon a special verdict, A question upon the case falling out upon a special
verdict.
the case was this, A lease of a house and lands was made to I S. for 99 years,
the remainder to I D. for 99 years, the remainder to A. B. for 99 years;
provided, that if the lessees do not inhabit in the house let during the whole
term, that then the lease shall be void. The question here was, How long the
lessees were bound to inhabit in the house? whether for the first 99 years? or
for that term, and also during all the years in remainder? and which of the
lessees were to Inhabit? Windham held, that the two first lessees only ought to
inhabit during the first 99 years, and no longer. But Roll chief Justice held,
that those in the remainder were not bound to inhabit before the remainder
falls to them; but reddendendo singula singulis they ought to inhabit
successively one after another. And he took an exception to the verdict. That
the lease being to begin after the death of one Robert Dudeny, it did not find
that Robert was dead, and so it appears not that the lease is yet begun; and so
there can be no question stirred as yet: Venire.
and thereupon the case was not argued, but a Venire facias de novo was to
issue, because the special verdict was imperfect.

THis case, Opinion of the Judges upon an arrest of Judgment in an Action of

formerly spoken to and argued, being an Action of the case for slandering the
Plaintifs title, was now spoken to by the Judges: And first by Roll chief
Justice, who held that the Action did not lie, although it be alleged that the
words were spoken salso et malitiose; for the Plaintiff ought to show a special
Cause: But that the verdict may supply. But the Plaintiff ought also to have
showed a special damage, which he has not don, and this the verdict cannot
supply. The Declaration here is too general, upon which no good issue can be
joined: and he ought to have alleged, that there was a communication had before
the words spoken touching the sale of the lands whereof the title was
slandered, and that by speaking of them, Case.
the sale was hindered, and he cited 13 Iac, Tuer and Bailyes case, B. R. and 21
Iac. Doctor Edwards and Balls case, and 4 Car. Roe and Harwoods case, a
Judgment in it in Windsor Court, and reversed here; and 12 Jac. Sell and
Paryes case, B. R. Ierman Justice to the same effect: and he said, that there
ought to be damnum et injuria alleged to maintain the Action; for one without
the other is not enough, and here does not appear any damage, because there
appears no communication of selling of the land. Nicholas and Ask Justices of
the same opinion: So the rule was, Nil capiat per billam, except better cause
shown. Roll Justice said, that there is digitus Dei in the case; for there was
a strange verdict found.

Pasch. 24 Car. rot. 400.
THe case between Ridley and Emerson was again spoken unto. Argument in a writ
of Error to reverse a Judgment in debt upon an Obligation.
It was in a writ of Error to reverse a Judgment given in an Action of debt
upon an Obligation in the Common Pleas. The Condition of the Obligation was,
that the Defendant should not put cattle upon a Common, viz. Ransom Moor,
before the proof and trial of the title of the Common were had. The Defendant
pleaded, that he did not put in his Cattle. The Plaintiff replied, that the
Defendant did put three Mares there before the proof or trial. An exception was
taken, that there is variance between the Replication and Rejoinder, and the
Condition of the Obligation, Variance.
and so it is not good. Twisden of Council on the other side, held that it was
good enough notwithstanding, because it is after a verdict, and there is a good
issue joined. Holhead on the Contrary held it ill; 1. Because the Replication
does not assign a breach of the Condition of the Obligation. 2ly, It is said in
the Condition, he shall not put Cattle into our Common; and the Replication is,
that he did put cattle into such a Common, naming it, and does not show where
the Common lies. 3ly, There is variance between the Declaration and the writ of
error. 4ly, There is a name mistaken, for in one place it is Matheum, and in
another it is Mathiae. The Court bid them advise, and bring Books to the Judges.

BRungy brought an Action of Trespass against Lee, Demurrer upon a Plea in

for taking of a Mare and impounding her till the Plaintiff had paid 10 l. The
Defendant pleaded by way of Justification, that he did distrain her by virtue
of an order made by Commissioners of Sewers, for a tax assessed by them upon
the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff demurred to this Plea, and showed for cause, 1. That
it does not appear, that the Commissioners who imposed the Tax had authority to
do it, for it ought to be done by six of them, and it does not appear here,
that they were more in number than four. 2ly. It does not appear, that they
were all of them of the Quorum, as they ought to be. Plea.
3ly. There does not appear to be any fault in the Plaintiff, why he should be
taxed. 4ly. The number of the Acres of Land does not appear upon which the Tax
was laid. 5ly. It does not appear, that the Land taxed did lie within the
Jurisdiction of the Commissioners. Upon these Exceptions the Plea was
overruled.

Coals against Sibsye.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
Coals brought an Action of Trover and Conversion against Sibsye; Demurrer upon
a replication in Trover and Conversion.
The Defendant pleads the Statute of Limitation of Actions in Bar. The Plaintiff
replied, that he took out a Latitat such a Term against the Defendant for this
cause now depending, which was within the time limited by the Statute. To this
replication the Defendant demurred, and for cause showed, that it was
uncertain, and so no issue can be joined upon it: for it only says, that he
took out a Latitat such a Term, and does not show what day of the Term he took
it out, and so we cannot take issue upon it, and the usual form is to show the
day. Latch maintained the replication, and said, it was good in matter of
substance, and the Latitat shall be intended to issue forth the first day of
the Term: Term.
for all the Term is but one day in construction of the Law, and the Defendant
may take a certain issue, as it is pleaded. Roll chief Justice answered, you
ought to have showed the test of the Latitat: Time.
for the time is material in this Case, viz. to know whether it were sued forth
within the time expressed in the Statute for the limitation of Actions, or
without, namely within six years or no, and you might have made it certain by
your pleading it specially. Ierman differed in opinion; and thereupon the Court
took time to advise. Vid. antea.

against the Inhabitants of Outwell, removed hither by the said Inhabitants, by
a Certiorari, These exceptions were taken, 1. There does not appear to be any
adjournment of the Commission. Adjournment.
But to this the Court answered, that it needed not. Hales said, that the
charge of reparation of a breach in Sea-walls, which happens by inevitable
necessity, ought to be repaired by the whole Level, and not by any particular
Vill or person. And 2ly. the charge ought to be laid indifferently: but here is
a particular Custom of which the Commissioners of Sewers may take notice, and
therefore the Commissioners are not compelled to lay the tax equally upon the
Lands within the Vill, for the Custom may be to the contrary, and yet have a
reasonable construction, Custom.
and this is the Custom of Marshland for the speedy repair of breaches to
prevent public danger, and afterward the tax is equally distributed upon the
Vills adjacent. And an implication in a Retorn made by Commissioners of Sewers
is good enough. Retorn.
Maynard on the other side held, that the Custom was well set forth for the
general charge for the present necessity, and afterward the particular
Inhabitants charged shall have remedy against the other Inhabitants to make
them contribute, as it was in Doctor Lambs Case, that was flain in an Vproar in
London, where the City was fined generally, but the Citizens afterward
contributed to the payment of it: for all are liable to the charge by the
Common law, and it may be also by the prescription. 10 Ed. 3. f. 8, 9.
The Court reproved the Council, and said, you ought not to argue two of you at
one time on the same side, except it be upon conclusion of the arguments at Bar
in the cause. Roll chief Justice said, the tax ought to be particular, but it
is not to be laid upon the Township, if there be not a Custom for it, and such
a Custom may be reasonable, and it is dangerous to destroy it, for fear of the
public danger that may arise by doing it. Retorn.
And for the retorn of the Commissioners it is not necessary it should be so
strict as our pleadings are. The Court gave Twisden time till that day seven
night to be heard on the other side. At which time to the exception that was
taken, that it appears not that Lynn Regis is within the limits of the
Commission by virtue of which the tax is made; It was answered, that it does
appear. To the second exception taken, that here is a new Bank or Wall ordered
to be made, and not the repairing the old, and this is not within the
Commission; It was answered, that the making of the new Bank is but to
strengthen the old Bank, and so is but a repairing of an old work, and not the
making of of a new. 2ly. The Wall is to be made by consent of all the
Inhabitants interessed in the benefit, which may accrue by the making of it. As
to the exception that it appears not that Tyd and Newton are within the
Hundred of Witsbitch, touching which only this Commission of Sewers was
granted; It was answered, that it shall be so intended, and it is also so
found. To the exception, that the new Bank was made in another manner than the
old Bank, and so it is a new work, and it appears not that the parties taxed
have any benefit by it; It was answered, that it does not appear that the
Drayners have done any thing for their own benefit in the making this Bank, nor
were any cause of making the new Bank. To the exception that it is not
presented where the Bank is; It was answered, it is certain enough set forth in
the Presentment, and Presentiments are not required to be so precise as other
pleadings are. To the exception that Tyd and Newton ought not to make the Bank
because other Towns use to do it; It was answered, that for making it in the
new manner, the other Vills are not bound to make it alone, but those also that
receive the benefit by it. These exceptions following were also taken to the
laying of the Tax. 1. That all the Lands within the Vills of Newton and Tyd are
not charged, but so many Acres in one, and so many in another. To this it was
answered, that it does not appear that there were more Acres than are taxed
either in Tyd or Newton. 2ly. The high grounds and the low grounds are equally
taxed, which is not indifferent: for some acres are of a greater value than
others are. To this it was answered, that for ought that does appear they are
of an equal value. 3ly. They ought not to sell the distress taken, because the
Vills did not bring in the number of acres, by the Officer appointed by the
Commissioners to do it. It was answered, that they may sell the goods, or
allow a Replevin: And secondly here appears not to be any distress or
impounding of the goods. Sergeant Barnard on the other side: First he said,
that all the exceptions are not opened, and the first exception is not
answered; for it appears not by averment that the Vills taxed are within the
extent of their Commission, as it ought do, 2 H. 7. f. 13. Nor is the second
Exception answered; and although the Council might at the finding of the
Commission have taken it, yet it may be taken now; and it is not showed how the
old bank was insufficient, nor what the charge would be to repair it: Nor is it
showed how Tyd and Newton are in danger by the not repairing and making of the
new bank. Also the Commissioners have exceeded their authority in exceeding the
ancient manner of taxing for the maintenance of this bank, and the tax ought to
be laid according to the quality and quantity of the lands, which are to be
taxed, and here does not appear how many acres are in the several Vills, nor
whether the tax do extend to all, and the good land and bad lands are also
equally taxed, neither ought there to be a new tax imposed upon one Vill to
ease another, which by the custom ought to repair the bank: And they have also
made a new Officer here, which by the Statute they have not authority, and have
made an order to punish one for refusing this Office, by distress of his goods,
which ought not to be; and they ought not to refuse a replevin of the distress
taken, as they have here done, and the lands only that are liable to the tax
are to be distrained for it, and not the goods of another that is not within
the extent of the Commission, and upon these exceptions he prayed the
presentment might be quashed, Roll chief Justice answered, we will not make all
the law void for some exceptions, therefore give notice upon what exceptions
you will stand upon. Maynard answered, upon these. 1. That there ought not to
be such a tax laid, because the lands taxed are not within the extent of the
Commission; for it appears not that they are within the Hundred of Wisbitch.
2ly. All the Inhabitants within all the Vills are not taxed, which ought to be,
because they have equal benefit, as it appears by the presentment. The Court
ordered it should be moved again the next term. And Roll chief Justice asked
why the drainers should not discharge this charge, who have been the cause of
it, and they receive benefit by their draining; and it is not fit they should
prejudice others by it. Postea.

Pymm and Morgan, alias Bambery and Basely.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
THis case was again moved upon a special Verdict in an Ejectione firmae,
wherein the question was, Argument upon a case upon a special verdict in an
Ejectione firmae.
Whether the estate of Mary Morgan that was settled 13 Car. is taken away by the
Ordinance of Parliament made 1645. and which looked back to 1641. which was
after 13 Caroli. It was held by the Council that argued against the Ordinance
that it was not, because the Ordinance is made against a dead man. 2ly. The
estate of Morgan was forfeited to the State, and they out of it do make an
estate for Pymm, with retrospection to the year 1641, and no further; and
therefore the estate settled before that time is not taken away: And if a
Statute have a double sense, one against Common Justice, and the other with
Common Justice, in equal balance, it shall be interpreted in the better sense;
and that that has been objected, that there is a power of revocation in the
settlement is not material; for Morgan is now dead, and so this personal power
is now gone, and shall not hurt the settlement. A second reason is taken from
the scope of the Ordinance, which consists of three parts: 1. The Parliament
injured. 2ly. Morgan the Offender punished, 3ly. Pymm rewarded, and the
Ordinance shall not be stretched to punish Mary, who has a particular
interest, although there be not an express saving for her in the Ordinance, 21
H. 7.4. Plow. Comment. 487 7 Car. Porter and Bellingham, and that this is the
meaning of the Ordinance may appear, because the remainder is reserved to the
Common wealth; and in doubtful Constructions of Statutes and Ordinances, that
shall be taken, Interpretation.
which makes all parts of the Ordinance or Statute stand together, and such is
the Construction here in not interrupting the estate of Mary. But it is
objected, that the right of the Daughters is provided for if they claim from
another Ancestor, and not from Morgan their Father. It was answered, that there
is the same reason to provide for Morgans state that was rightly conveyed from
him before the year 1641. as of a strangers so deriving from Morgan. It is also
objected that the Trustees for Pymm and the Common wealth shall have Morgans
lands, and they shall not be said to be forfeited. It was answered, that the
Act distributes no more than is forfeited, which can be no more than Morgan had
at that time. 2ly. The Parliament took no notice that Morgan was seized in fee
simple, nor what estate he had. 3ly. After the estate of Mary Morgan ended, the
reversion in fee returns to Thomas Morgan, so that Mary has but a particular
estate, and the Ordinance may be satisfied though Mary Morgans estate be not
forfeited; for the reversion may be forfeited, and the particular estate
preserved, as Cleres Case is; and the saving is not here repugnant, as it is
objected, nor destroys the generality of the Ordinance, for it is here
satisfied. And the Parliament does not take notice of the conveyance made by
Thomas Morgan, nor of any other estate than that he had at the time of the
making of the Ordinance; otherwise there would be a great inconvenience; but it
is objected, that the Sons claiming under Thomas Morgan are excluded out of the
saving. It was answered, that although they are, yet they are not excluded out
of the body of the Act, Dyer 273 ^ o Eliz, and here the excepting of the
interest of the Daughters in the saving has its effect, viz. the estate which
they have of Thomas Morgan after 1641. which shall be given by the Ordinance,
and not that which they had before, and so prayed judgment for the Plaintiff,
viz. Mary Morgans lessee. Maynard for the Defendant, viz. Pymms heir said, That
the Act is the rule to measure our case by; and that the Act does take away the
right of all the Children, and that the saving helps none but strangers, and
notwithstanding the recompense reserved for Pymm, if the estate shall be short,
it is intended of such an estate not within the saving; and the estate of the
Children is not within the saving, and here is not a general gift, but these
lands particularly; And in this case Morgan had power to revoke his settlement,
and so there is no breach made by the Ordinance of Common Justice, as is
objected; because he had an interest in the estate, notwithstanding the
settlement. And all parts of the Act stand very well here together upon the
best construction of it, according to the makers intent. If I grant all my
trees, fruittrees will not pass; but if I except all my Apple Trees, all other
fruittrees pass, and the inheritance in Morgan does not satisfy the Act, and
so prayed Judgment for the Defendant. Roll chief Justice said: Mr. Maynard you
mistake the first part of the Ordinance, for do you think that the Ordinance
looks further back than 1641. in other lands not expressed? and he seemed to
incline for the Plaintiff, but the other Judges for the Defendant. But the Court
concluded that it was a great case, and deserved great consideration, and
therefore ordered, That it should be argued again the first Saturday the next
Term.

Curiam consideratum est; whereas it ought to be per eandem Curiam. 2ly. It is
recuperare debeat, whereas it ought to be debet. But Roll chief Justice
answered, that is well enough in a judgment upon a nihil dicit. 3ly. In the

Smith against Andrews.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
ANdrews, an Attorney, brought an Action upon the case against Smith, Arrest of
Judgment in an action on the case.
for speaking of these words against him, He, meaning the Plaintiff, stirrs up
men to suits, and promises, that if he recover not for them, he will take no
fees; and yet in a suit which he so undertook for me wherein I was overthrown,
he took Charges of me. Upon not guilty pleaded, there was a verdict and a
judgment for the Plaintiff. The Defendant brought a writ of Error, and for
cause it was showed by Maynard, that there are entire damages given for diverse
words spoken at one time, whereof some are Actionable, and others not, which
ought not to be: and 2ly, The words in themselves are not actionable; for an
Attorney may stir up men to suits, if their suits be lawful; (which Roll chief
Justice denied) 17 Car. Gibson and Baxter. Maintenance.
And he said, that an Attorney may prosecute his Clyents cause without seed,
and yet it is not maintenance. Trin. 16 Car. Hill and Sands his Case. Hales on
the other side held that the words are Actionable; for the words shall be taken
in the worst sense: and he also shows how he had stirred up suits in an
unlawful manner, viz. by making of bargains with men at Markets. Roll chief
Justice said, that such words shall be taken mitiori sensu, and this is a
special maintenance, for it is in the case of an Attorney, and therefore
lawful; but here are other words spoken to show that he stirred up suits
unlawfully; and the stirring up of suits and making bargains to follow them, is
in it self unlawful, and great inconveniences do grow by such manner of
practicing, and all the words ought to be taken together, and not dividedly;
for so you may make any words not actionable. Ierman Justice held the words
were actionable; because they are a great scandal, and trenching to destroy the
Plaintifs livelihood and practice. And said, that Attorneys ought not to go to
Markets to get practice, and the words spoken are to show he is a stirrer up of
suits, and to show that he was a false dealer, and the words shall be taken in
the Common acception, and not mitiori sensu. Nicholas as Ierman; and that the
words taken together are actionable. Ask Justice to the same effect. Whereupon

if Hall should dse before such a day, and for not performing this promise the
Action was brought; upon non Assumpsit pleaded, there was an issue joined, and
a verdict found for the Plaintiff. The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment,
and showed that it does not appear that there was any notice given by the
Plaintiff to the Defendant, how much money was due to the Plaintiff from Sir John
Hall, as there ought to be. Roll chief Justice answered, You did undertake to
know, at the time of the Assumpsit, how much money he did owe, and notice is not
necessary, Notice.
and if it were, he might have gone to Sir John Hall to tell him, and so it
shall not only be intended to be in the knowledge of the Defendant himself, but
that he might have also knowledge of it by others. Ierman Justice doubted, but
Nicholas and Ask Judges were of Rolls opinion, and the Plaintiff ordered to take
his Judgment, if better matter were not shown.

Custodes Libertat. etc. against the Inhabitants of Outwell.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
THis Case was again moved: Exceptions upon an order of Commissioners of
Sewers, and answers to them
wherein upon a presentment made to Commissioners of Sewers, an order was made
by them to reimburse the Dike-reeves, for money expended in repairing a Sea
wall, by laying a tax upon diverse Vills, amongst which Owtwell was one: diverse
exceptions had been formerly taken to the presentment and order. At this time
it was 1. objected, that the Commissioners cannot alter the usual custom for
making the tax, as they have here done: and therefore their Order is not good.
It was answered, that there is no custom here presented; but if there be, yet
the tax cannot be laid generally upon the Vill, but distributively; for every
one of the inhabitants have not an equal share of the land, nor are all the
lands of equal goodness: And there is no custom for the Vill of Owtwell to
approtion the tax, so that they have no authority to do it. Windham on the
same side said, that there is no prescription or custom here found, and so the
tax ought to be ruled by the Common Law, and other Towns ought thereby to be
Contributory, which receive benefit by the making of the bank; and the
Commissioners of Sewers have not here pursued the direction of the Statute of
Sewers as they ought to do. And here the presentiments, upon which this order
for the tax was grounded, were made by three Iuries of several Hundreds, and
the breach to be repaired does not appear to be within any of the Hundreds
whence the Iuries come, as the Statute does direct, neither is it showed how
the inhabitants are chargeable, whether by tenure, or custom, or how else.
Holhead on the same side said, It is not said how the lands are liable to the
tax. 1. It is not showed in what part of the Poe-Dike the breach happened.
Maynard on the other side said, that the Commission of enquiry finds by what
default the breach happens, but they cannot tell how many acres every one
holds, to charge them several; and it may be intended that they hold jointly,
and it shall be intended that the lands are liable to the tax by prescription,
and it is not necessary to show in what place of the Poe-Dike the breach
happened, Roll chief Justice said, the prescription here is waived; for you say
that it was not an inevitable breach, and so you are at the Common law, and not
upon a custom, and then the tax ought to be equal, and according to the number
of the Acres, and it is not so here. And it appears not that the breach is
within the Hundreds whence the Jury came and so they have no authority to
enquire. Hales said, that there is a clause to help this, for there is a power
in the Commissioners to ease them that have wrong done to them. Roll chief
Justice, This will not help, Tax.
for the tax ought to be well and equally laid, according to the Statute, viz.
upon the number of the Acres, and here it is laid upon the persons of the
inhabitants. Therefore make a new tax.

Earl Rivers against More.

THe Earl Rivers was taken by a Latitat and committed to the Marshalsea; The

pleaded in abatement of the writ, and now you pray to be delidered upon a bare
suggestion. Wild of Council with the Defendant held, that a Capias does now lie
against an Earl; for comes dicitur a Comitando-rege, Capias.
and cessante rege cessat comes, And demurred to the plea for want of form.
Roll chief Justice said, That Earls, and Barons are ancient titles of the
Realm. But let him plead as he will stand to it, and advise well of the plea
before the Demurrer joined; for we can give leave to amend the plea. Amendment.


VVare against Chapel.
Mich. 1649. Banc. sup.
VVAre brought an Action of Debt for 500. against Chapel, Demurrer to a plea
in Covenant.
upon an Indenture of Covenants between them, viz. That Ware should raise 500
Soldiers, and bring them to such a port, and that Chapel should find shipping
and victuals for them to transport them to Gallicia; and for not providing the
shipping and victuals at the time appointed, was the Action brought. The
Defendant pleaded, that the Plaintiff had not raised the Soldiers at that time;
and to this plea the Plaintiff demurs. Windham of Council with the Plaintiff,
held, that the Defendant ought to have provided the shipping and victual
against the time, though the Soldiers were not raised; for the not raising of
the Soldiers can be only urged by way of mitigation of damages, and not
pleaded in discharge of the breach assigned. Yard of Council with the
Defendant, held the plea was good in bar of the Action, for the Covenants of
each part have relation one to the other, and there is a condition precedent
made by the words, to find shipping for the Soldiers: so that the Defendant
was not to find shipping, Precedent condition.
except the Plaintiff raised the Soldiers, neither is there any notice given us
how many Soldiers he had raised. Roll chief Justice held, that there was no
condition precedent; but that they are distinct and mutual covenants, and that
there may be several actions brought for them: Notice.
and it is not necessary to give notice of the number of the men raised, for
the number is known to be 500. and the time for the shipping to be ready, is
also known by the Covenants; and you have your remedy against him if he raise
not the men, as he has against you for not providing the shipping. Ierman and
Nicholas Justices, held against Roll, that there is a precedent condition. Ask
Justice was of Roll the Chief Justices opinion, Nicholas changed his opinion,
and so judgment was given for the Plaintiff, except better matter were shown.

THis case formerly spoken to, was again moved, which was this in effect: Plea
in abatement, after imparlance.
Weston brought an Action of debt against Plowden, upon an Obligation of 2000
l. for the payment of 1000 l. The Defendant appears and imparls, and after
imparlance, pleads in Abatement of the writ, that he is Earl of Nova Albion in
Ireland, and ought to be impleaded by that name, and not by the name of Edmund
Plowden Knight: upon this plea the Plaintiff demurred; 1. Because it came in
after imparlance, whereas a plea in abatement of a writ, ought to be pleaded
before imparlance. 2ly. Plea.
The plea is s^ivolous; for he pleads that he was Earl of Nova Albion before he
entered into the bond, which he cannot now plead, Estoppel.
for he is estopped to plead so by his own deed, which testifies the contrary.
Roll chief Justice said, it is a dilatory plea, for he is but a Knight here,
though he be an Earl in Ireland, and his own Obligation stops him from pleading
as he does. And therefore let him show cause why he shall not plead in chief
within a week, otherwise let Judgment be entered. Vid. antea.

Entered Trin. 24 Car. rot. 1529.
AN ejectione firmae was brought for certain lands in Lincoln Shire and upon
not guilty pleaded, Argument upon a special verdict in an ejectione firmae.
there was a special verdict found to this effect. I. S. being seized of the
Lands in question in Fee made a Feoffment there. of to A. B and C. D. and to
their Heirs till they should maite a Lease of the said Lands for diverse years
to certain uses, to begin at the Feast of Philip and Jacob next coming; The
Feoffees enter, and make a lease for years of the Lands to begin from the Feast
of Philip and Jacob next. The question was whether the Feoffees have made such
a Lease as the deed of Feoffment directs, and so the uses are raised thereupon,
or whether it shall be intended another lease, and not warranted by the
Feoffment, and so no uses raised; Latch held that the Lease is not warranted by
the deed of Feoffment, and that there are no uses raised, for the words at the
Feast, and the words from the Feast make several beginnings of the Lease, and
so here is another Lease made than the deed intended. 2ly. It is not in effect
and intention the lease of the parties, because it is not made according to
their directions, and so there are no uses raised, for the authority is not
pursued, nor the precedent condition observed, and so the lease has another
beginning, and another ending, and so it must be another Lease, Fitzh. graunts
63. And here is not the same reversion intended to the party, viz. his Son
Watson, because it is upon another Lease, and so a different reversion. And
although the Jury might have found the intent of the party, and so the same
Lease, yet they have not found it. 2. rep. Crumwells case. 5. rep. Earl of

shall result to the Feoffor or remain in the Feoffees, he held that it does
result to the Feoffor, and remains not in the Feoffees; For first there was no
other thing intended to be in the Feoffees than to make the lease good, and
that is not here done, and Dyer 300. cited is not to this purpose. The
intention of the parties is not prevalent in directing of uses, and Dyer 300.
may be applied to our case to determine the use, 4. rep. 82. Barbers case,

use is to revert out of the Feoffees to the Feoffor, according to his first
estate. 3ly. For the question whether a good estate pass to Elizabeth, and the
others, he held that there did a good Estate pass either by bargain and sale,
or otherwise. But it is good by bargain and sale, notwithstanding it be upon
consideration past, which is no consideration, and the other consideration
expressed to raise the use hurts not, and here is a good consideration, Mich. 8
Iac. Gosman and Carington, C. B. There was no good consideration; but a
courtesy, 13. and 14 Eliz. Horwoods case there was a good consideration,
although there be no moneys paid, but land for land. 2ly. If it do not pass by
way of bargain and sale, yet it shall pass by way of Covenant to stand seized
to uses, and the consideration expressed is good to raise the uses: Bedles case
7 Rep. these considerations cannot be silenced by the considerations of bargain
and sale; nor shall the intent to pass it by way of bargain and sale hurt it,
and if he take by way of use, yet it makes not the join tenancy operate as a
tenancy in Common, and so it is the same lease declared upon, and not diverse;
and there is no disseisin by the entry of the Lessee at election; for though he
be not Lessee by the Lease intended, yet he is Lessee by the one Lease or the
other; for the Lease is made either by the Feoffor, or by the Feoffee, and so
he prayed judgment for the Plaintiff. Pannell for the Defendant put the case
at large, and made these questions. 1. Whether here be such a Lease as the
first Indenture does direct. 2ly. If the use do not arise where the estate is.
3ly. Whether there be a good bargain and sale. 4ly. Whether there be a good

the parties. The words have here an extraordinary signification, according to
time and place, and at or in a place are all one, and the word at may be
satisfied with time precedent or subsequent, and quae incontinenter fiunt

the Lease be not good, and no use raised, then where the estate of the land is?
And he held that it is in the Feoffees not withstanding; for here the use is
limited, but not in the cases put on the other side. And here was a fee simple
determinable; but it being become impossible, it is a fee absolute. Trin. 18
Car. Roll and Bois, and Dyer 300. is mistaken in putting of the case on the
other side: And it cannot result, for there is no use here to result, but the
party is in by the Common Law. To the 3 point, if the use does result, yet the
estate of Hamond hinders the bargain and sale; for he is a wrong doer, because
that the fee being determined by his holding over he is a wrong doer; but if
not, yet his Estate is paramount. For the 4th, he held that the bargain and
sale is not good upon the consideration expressed, because it is not made for
moneys paid nor secured to be paid. 37 E^z. Ward and Lamberts case C. B. For
the 5th. point he held, that it does not enure as a Covenant to stand seized,

Upon an Endictment preferred 22 Car. at the Assizes in Kent against one for
engrossing Apples, Arrest ^f Judgment in an Action upon the Stat. against
eng^^ssing Victual.
Pears, and Cherries, framed upon the Statute made against engrossers of
Victuals, the Defendant pleaded and was found guilty, formerly judgment was
arrested, and the Council heard. Edward Johnson of the Inner Temple prayed for
Judgment for the Keepers of the liberty, and. notwithstanding what had been
objected formerly; and that upon these reasons. 1. Because that Apples, Pears
and Cherries are Victuals within the Statute, and that because the Statute is
not to be abridged. And the Statute of 2 Ed. 6. made concerning fruiterers
expounds this Statute, that Apples and Pears, and. are Victuals, for the
Fruiterers are called sellers of Victuals; and for Bois his case that is
objected that Apples are not Victual, it is not to be meant of all sorts of
victual in a general acception, and without doubt engrossing of them is
engrossing at the Common Law, 26 Eliz. Salt is no Victual per se, nor is used
as Victual in any Country; yet it is there said to be Victual. But Apples are
Victual per se, and Costermongers are called Victuallers by their Charters.
Roll chief Justice said, That 4 Iac. Apples were adjudged no Victuals; and
after upon a writ of Error this Judgment was affirmed in the Exchequer
Chamber, and therefore that judgment is not to be lightly passed over; and if
they should be adjudged Victuals, the trade of the Costerwongers would be
destroyed: and for Salt it is no Victual, but a preservative of Victual; and
Hops was adjudged to be no Victual, 20 Iac. upon a reference made to the
Judges. Neither are Apples to be accounted Victual within the Statute. Ierman
Justice differed, and Nicholas Justice held, that Apples are Victual within the
Statute, because they are better than Fish. Ask Justice held, that Apples are
Victual, but not within the Statute, for a Statute cannot alter by reason of
time, but the Common Law may. It was adjourned.

and their order made thereupon was again spoken to. Twisden against the
presentment said, That it is not a presentment by Jury, as it ought to be by
the Statute; for the Jury have only power to enquire of things within the
Hundred of Wisbitch, and it does not appear that Newton and Tyd are within that
Hundred. 2ly. The substance of the presentment is not good; for the

repairing of the bank shall contribute to the reparations, 18 E. 3. f. 22. 3ly.
They cannot order to make a new wall notwithstanding Callice his opinion in his
reading upon the Statute of Se^^ers. 4ly. The Tax is not well laid, for it is
not laid upon all the Lands within Newton and Tyd, as it ought to be charged,
if any ought to be. Holhead answered to this last exception, that it does not
appear there are more Lands in Tyd or Newton than are charged. And Roll chief
Justice said, that is well enough. To the third exception, Holhead said it is
not wholly a new work, and therefore they may order to make it. To which Roll
chief Justice assented, and said it was so notwithstanding the Case of the I Will
of Ely, for that was for the making of a new work totally. To the 2d. Exception
he read the words of the presentment, by which it appears, that because the
adventurers had no Lands to be charged, and it is found necessary to be
repaired, that therefore it is to be repaired by Newton and Tyd for the present
necessity. Maynard answered that they are not bound to repair for the Act of a
Stranger. Taxes.
Roll chief Justice answered, Newton and Tyd may take there remedies against
the strange adventurers, and it seems there was a present necessity to repair
it for public safety. If one be bound by prescription to repair a wall, yet
to prevent the present, and public danger, the Commissioners may tax others
to do it, and the Law is just that is here made by the Commissioners. But the
1. Exception is not answered, and so the Commissioners have exceeded their

Pasc. 11. Car. Banc. Reg. Huttens reports, Trin. 7 Car. Banc. Reg. and adjudged

levying such a fine, and concluded it was a forfeiture. Wadham Windham on the
other side argued that it was no forfeiture; Forfeiture.
And cited Mich. 24 E. 3. and Dyer 139. and laid this for a ground, that where
a Feoffment in Fee made by a Tenant for lise, does displace any remainder, that
such a Feoffment is a forfeiture, but it is not so in this Case, and therefore
it can be no forfeiture. If Tenant for life of a rent or of an Advowson levy a
fine, it is a forfeiture, although that no remainder be displaced, this is the
great objection, 15 E. 4. f. 15 by Littleton, and the fine fur conisance de
droit implies a Fee simple, 40 Ed. 3. But there a Fee simple really passed with
the estate for life; But here it passes by way of interest, and not by way of
estopel, and the Conusee may confess and avoid, and therefore here is no
estopel, and so it differs from the Cases, objected 6 Rich. 2 Estopel 211. But
it is objected, that he has taken upon him to pass all the estate, which is

life, the remainder in fail, the remainder in Fee to Tenant for life, if Tenant
for life levy a fine it is no forfeiture, 10 H. 4. f. 2. Tenant for life may
pray in aid of all in the, remainder, and he said, that in this case is no
forfeiture nor estopel, nor has he passed more than he has, and there is no
wrong by the fine; but it shall only pass what may be passed, and he said, a
fine is a Feoffment when the thing to pass by it lies in Livery, otherwise it
is but a grant, and devests no estate as a Feoffment does. And in Baker and
Hackers Case in this Court, Bredons Case was denied for Law by Bramston, Jones
and Barkley, Hob. 388, 389. It is no discontinuance, and such estate shall
first pass, by which no wrong shall be done. The Judges ought to be A^tuti to
invent reasons to support estates, and to defend from injuries, and where the
Conusee of the fine has an interest to pass by it to satisfy the operation
of it, such a fine is good, and does no wrong, as it is in our Case. It is
objected, that there is a Fee simple here, but it is of no value, for it is
after an estate tail, and shall not be assets in the Heir; It was answered, It
is but of little value, but it has more than a right in it, and so he prayed
judgment for the Defendant. Forfeiture.
Roll chief Justice held, it was a forfeiture although there be no displacings
of estates, because it puts an estate in a stranger, who ought not to have it,
as Bredons Case is, where one does acknowledge another to have the inheritance
by the fine, this is a forfeiture: By the fine here the Conusor acknowledges
more to the Conusee than he has, and he might have expressed in the fine the
estate that he has in the Land, and no more, and so there is an estate in
possession here. Ierman Justice said, the fine shall not be construed to do
wrong; but the Case is of consequence, therefore he would advise. Nicholas held
it was no forfeiture. Ask was of the opinion of the chief justice. Roll chief
Justice said estopels will make forfeitures in many Cases. Q. what Judgment

lawful to frame words, and so for the rest, being new things not known to the

therefore it is a good description of the thing: and de instrumento ligneo

argenteum servitium, anglice, a silver Salt-cellar, cannot be good, for
servitium is Latin for service. But Roll chief Justice said, if servicium

THis case arising upon a special verdict found in an Ejectione firmae,
Argument upon the Case concerning the Manor of Callidown given to Mr. Pym.
touching the title of the Manor of Callidowne, being part of Sir Thomas
Morgans estate that was given to Mr. Pym by Ordinance of Parliament, and
heretofore argued on both parts, was again spoken to: First by Twisden, who
argued for the Plaintiff; who said, the Question is, Whether the estate settled
by Sir Thomas Morgan before the year 1641. be forfeited by the Act of
Parliament, and consequently well given to Mr. Pym, or no? And he said, the
intent of the Parliament in making this Act is first to be interpreted: and he
held, that according to the Act no estate passes, but such estate as Morgan
had in the year 1641. and no more; for no man can forfeit a thing that he has
not, but only that which he has; but Morgan then had not this estate: and
therefore he could not forfeit it. 2ly, There is a priority of vesting the
estate in the Parliament, and next from the Parliament to the Trustees, and the
Trustees can have no more than is forfeited to the Parliament, and the estate
settled before the year 1641. is not forfeited to the Parliament. 3ly, The
penning of the Act is considerable; The Act says all the said lands, that is
all the said lands that Morgan had in the yeart 1641. and not all the lands
that Morgan ever had before that time, and had settled; for the precedent words
are restrained by the words subsequent, Althams case, 8 Rep. Dyer 369. and from
the preamble of the Act to make a construction to punish innocent persons, is
against the Law of God, Man, and Nature, Nichols case, f. 398. Of rewards and
punishments consist the essence of Commonwealths, and it could not be the
intent of the Parliament to punish innocent persons, 3 Ed. 4. 2. The Parliament
did not intend to give more of Morgans estate, than what he had 1641. for then
they might give that which might be evicted, which they intended not. And
whereas it is objected, that there is a clause of Revocation in Morgans
settlement and so the estate was not absolutely settled; It is answered, That
notwithstanding this power of Revocation, the estate is not given by this Act
unto Pym; for it cannot give a power, 7 Rep. 13. and a power cannot be
forfeited, and Mary Morgan had an interest in the land, notwithstanding the
power of Revocation. And notwithstanding there is no saving for Mary, yet the
estate is not passed; for Mary Morgan is not intended to be punished, Nichols
case, Com. f. 483. and so there needs no saving for her, 14 H. 8. f. 2. and it
cannot be intended because there is no saving for her, that therefore she shall
forfeit her estate, and the saving is not therefore idle; for it has an
operation another way. The saving is not intended of the estate of a Collateral
Auncestor only, for this is the begging of the question, for the saving saves
not any thing, and the penning of the words are against this exposition: and so
he concluded, that nothing was given by the Statute to Mr. Pym, but the estate
of Morgan which he had in the year 1641, and prayed judgment for the Plaintiff.
Steel, the Recorder of London, for the Defendant, said, he would only answer
the argument of Twisden, because he had heard no other arguments. And first he
held, that the Ordinance reaches all the estates that Morgan had, as well
before, as at the time 1641. and the estate settled by Morgan before 1641. was
the estate of Thomas Morgan in the year 1641. 2ly The lands are expressly named
which are given by the Statute, and it is not material who has the estate in
them for certitudo nominis tollit demonstrationem, Dowbey and Dudingtons case,
and Mildmayes case, 1 Rep. do interpret how the word others shall be
interpreted. And here cannot be said to be any injustice in the Parliament. The
Question here is, Whether the estate be settled by the Parliament? and if it be
settled, it would be a supposition of injustice, to suppose it is not rightly
done. The Law has invested the Parliament with a power to dispose of all
lands, and therefore it cannot be intended injustice; And the estate is not in
Mary Morgan notwithstanding the Conveyance, because there is a clause of
Revocation in it; for it is a void Conveyance as to her estate, by reason of
the clause of Revocation, for that makes it fraudulent. And the estate of Mary
Morgan is not passed by the Statute, notwithstanding the clause of eviction in
the Ordinance, an if or an an are no saving of an estate, and here is no
eviction in the case: and here is no saving, otherwise their estate cannot be
saved, for then the lands are all passed, And the saving extends to the lands
descended to the Children of Thomas Morgan, from Collateral Ancestors, and not
from Tho. Morgan the Father; and as reasonable a Construction ought to be made
of an Ordinance of Parliament as this is, as of an Act of Parliament, and so he
praid Judgment for the Defendant. Roll chief Justice said He did not doubt of
the power of the Parliament in this case, but of their meaning, whether they
intended these lands should be forfeited, or not: And the Ordinance was made by
the House of Commons without any proviso in it, and the proviso was put in by
the House of Lords, and he inclined that Mary Morgans estate was saved. But
Jerman Justice said, he conteived that Mary's estate was not saved, but only
the estate of strangers. The Court was divided, and said they would consider
till next Term, and then give Judgment in this and the Case of Garret and
Blizard.

Quaere, What Judgment was given in both cases, for I was not in Court at the
day they were spoken to again.

pleas pleaded to the jurisdiction of the Court. It is true that parcel of a

for this the Judgment was reversed except better matter shown. Damages.


Iennings against Lee.
Hill. 1649. Banc. sup.
GEnnings brought an Action of Trespa^s of an assault and battery against Lee
and his wife; Whether an issue well joined.
for an assault and battery made by the wife, the Feme pleads a special plea of
justification, that it was in defense of her Husband: The Plaintiff replies de
injuria sua propria, upon this there was an issue joined, and a verdict for the
Plaintiff; it was moved in Arrest of Judgment that the issue was nor well
joined, because the replication was not good, and so the verdict not good, and
so there can be no Judgment. Sergeant Parker prays judgment for the Plaintiff,
for he held the replication was good, and so a good Issue joined, and if there
be not, yet it is helped by the Verdict, Issue.
or else by the Statute of Ieofails, or if not, yet it is at least good in
part. And the issue here does imply a negative, although there be not a direct
negative, but an affirmative in the words of it. And 6 E. 4, 16 b. in a
Replevin, and 9 H. 5. f. 1. b. there are good issues joined in the affirmative,
because they imply a negative. Trin. 18 Jac. Banc. reg. Aldridge and Walthalls

material. 2ly. The Verdict has made the issue good, although it be not well
joined, 5 H. 7. f. 15. 3ly If the Verdict helps it not, yet the Statute of
Ieofails helps it, 5 Rep. Nichols case, 19 Eliz. Dallisons Reports, 8 and 9
Eliz. Bendloes Reports, and 14 Car. Banc. Reg. 4ly. If the Statute help not,
yet it is well enough, because it is good in part, and for part it is well
found, and damages shall be intented to be given for that which is well found,

Je^^ail.
Ierman Justice did differ in opinion, and said, if the Defendant plead an
immaterial thing, and the Plaintiff join issue, and it be found for him, he
shall have judgment; otherwise where the plea is partly material, partly
immaterial; for there the issue ought to be upon the material thing, otherwise
there can be no judgment. It was adjourned till Thursday following.

The Case was this, An Action of Assault and Battery and wounding was brought;
the Defendant pleads non cul. to the wounding, and justifies the Assault and
Battery in defense of her Husband, in keeping possession of certain lands. The
Plaintiff replied de injuria sua propria, and does not traverse absque tali
causa. The Jury find entire damages for all, whereas there is not a perfect
issue joined as to the Assault and Battery for want of the Traverse. Postea.

Hodges against Jane.
Hill. 1649. Banc. sup.
IN an Arrest of Judgment in this case, the question was, Whether debt lie
against an Executor sur concessit solve of the Testator. Wager of Law. Debt.
Executor.
Whether an Action do lie against an Executor upon a Concessit solvere of the
Testator upon a special custom. Roll chief Justice held that it does not, for
this would be to charge an Executor in an Action of Debt, where he may by the
Law wage his Law, and an Action of Debt lies not against an Executor upon a
simple contract made by the Testator. And he said that the reason for Ley gager
is, because it is intended that as well as the contract to pay money may be in
private, so may also the payment be made in private. Adjourned.

Giaves against Drake.
Hill. 1649. Banc. sup.
IN an Action of Trover and Conversion for diverse parcels of Household stuff, an
Exception was taken to the Declaration, Arrest of Judgment in a Trover and
Conversion.
because the Plaintiff amongst other things had declared pro sex parcellis
plumbi cinerii Anglice Pewter Porringers: whereas the word parcellis is
uncertain; for a parcel does consist of many things in number, and so sex
parcelli cannot be properly applied to six Porringers, but if it had been sex
peciis it had been better, though that be also uncertain. Hales held it was all
one as if it had been pro sex peciis plumbi Cinerii. Roll chief Justice
inclined it was well enough, because, though the words are not so proper, yet
the description is good enough. Declaration, Words.
Ierman Justice was of the same opinion. But Nicholas Justice held that the
Latin is not good, for if there be proper words for a thing, they ought to be
used, otherwise Barbarism will be induced; and circumlocution ought not to be
used where there is a proper Latin word to be had to express a thing. Ask
Justice agreed with Roll the chief Justice: And the Plaintiff was bid take his
Judgment, except better matter were shown to the contrary.

Hobson against Hudson.
Hill. 1649 Banc. sup.
HObson brought an Action upon the case against Hudson for speaking these words
of her, viz. She went to the Wells to be cured of the French Pox. Upon Not
guilty pleaded, and a verdict found for the Plaintiff, Arrest of Judgment is an
action for words.
the Defendant moved in Arrest of Judgment, that the words are not actionable,
because they are uncertain words, and do not express that the Plaintiff had the
French Pox at the time of the speaking of them, and the causa dicendi shall not
make them actionable. Shaftoe on the other side said the words are actionable;
for these words thou have been laid of the Pox, have been adjudged actionable,
which are not so scandalous as these, Mich. 7 Iac. Thou art a Pocky whore, and
the Pox has eaten out the bottom of thy belly, were held actionable. Roll
chief Justice said the words required consideration; but the words seem to
imply that the party did believe that she had the French Pox, else the would
not have gone to be cured, and so they are scandalous. Ierman Justice said,
intentions shall not make words actionable, and therefore he conceived they are
not actionable. Nicholas Justice said, he conceived them prima facie to be
actionable, for words shall be taken according to the common intendment, and an
Action on the Case may sometimes be brought upon words spoken by implication
and interrogation. A^k Justice held they were actionable. But the Court said
they would advise. Posten.

Wyatt against Harbye.
Hill. 1649. Banc. sup.
Mich. 1649 rot. 426.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in the Court at
Barnestable in an Action of Debt upon an Obligation. The Error assigned was,
Error to reverse a judgment in Debt at B. r^estable.
that the place alleged for the payment of the money, sued for is out of the
jurisdiction of the Court. It was answered, that it is said to be at
Chitlehampton aforesaid, and it does not appear whether Chitlehampton be within
the jurisdiction of the Court, or where it is, and therefore it shall be
intended to be within the jurisdiction. Roll chief Justice said, the
Declaration is, that the Obligation was at Barnestable, and the plea is that it
was at Chichley which is a foreign plea, and the plea is not sworn, neither is
there any demurrer upon the plea; but the plea is received, and day given to
swear it, and for not swearing it accordingly, a judgment is given against the
Plaintiff by default, Judgment.
whereas it ought to have been a Judgment upon a nibil dicit for want of a
plea, and he said also, Fere^n plea.
that if one plead an insufficient plea, although it be a foreign plea, it is
not necessary it should be sworn. The Judgment was ordered to be reversed,
except cause showed to the contrary.

Jones against Blunden.

Mich. 1649. rot. 34.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in the palace Court
at Westminster in an Action of Assault and Battery. Error to reverse a
Judgment given in the palace Court at Westminster. Trial.
The Case was this, an Action was brought for an Assault and Battery in Surry;
The Defendant pleads a plea of justification in Middlesex: The Plaintiff
replied that he beat him in Southwark, (which is in Surry) de injuria sua
propria absque tali causa, and this issue was tried by a Jury of Midlesex The
question was whether it were a good trial. The Court would advise. Postea.

Watson against Norbury and others.
Hill. 1649 Banc. sup.
Watson brought an Action upon the Case against Norbury a Commissioner upon
the Statute of Bankrupt and others, Demurrer to a plea in Trespass upon the
Case.
for the breaking of his house, and taking away his goods upon pretense of the
said Commission, whereas he was no Bankrupt, by reason whereof he was empaired
in his credit, and hindered in his Trade, and declares to his damage, etc. The
Defendant pleads that the Plaintiff had heretofore brought an Action of
Trespass against him for the same trespass, and goods taken, and had
recovered damages against him. To this plea the Plaintiff demurred; And upon
the demurrer the question was whether this plea pleaded by the Defendant be a
good plea in abatement of the writ of Trespass, upon the Case now brought, or
not? Abatement.
Shafto of Council with the Plaintiff argued that the plea was not good,
because the matter in this Action upon the Case, and the matter of the former
Action of Trespass are not all one; but are several and various matters, and
therefore several Actions may be brought for them, 15. rep. f. 43. Sparies
case, Hob. 493. The Earl of Bedfords case, 4. rep. ^lades case, Petty Brook
105. 4. rep. f. 43. Hudsons case, 11 Ed. 2. Fitzh. Trespass 207. 2 R. 3. f.

f. 44. And the variances here between the Action upon the Case, and the Action
of Trespass prove that they are not all one: And that there is a difference it
is plain; for in this Action upon the Case, it is said that the Defendant did
enter into the Plaintiffs house malitiose; but in the former Action of Trespass
it was said, that he did enter vi et armis, which is a plain difference and
variance, 8 H. 6. f. 27. Cooks Entries fol. 39. And the matters pleaded upon
Record in these several Actions do not destroy one another; but may well stand
together, Pasc. 2 Car. Laicon and Barnards case: And here this Action of the
Case is to repair the Plaintiffs credit; but the former Action was to recover
damages, for his goods taken from him. An abduxit of Cattle will maintain a
chasing, and one may therein recover for the chasing, and the value also, so
here both Actions may stand together. And there is matter for both Actions, and
the matter pleaded in Bar is but to increase the damages, and if the special
matter alleged in the Action of Trespass alleged in the Action upon the Case
had been less, yet it is well enough, and it is but surplusage, and only by
way of inducement to prove the scandal, and the Defendant here is not at any
mischief, for the words here are only put in agrravation of damages, 7 H. 6.
f. 34. and so prays judgment for the Plaintiff. Green of Council with the
Defendant prayed the Writ might be abated. Because 1. here is not any thing
laid, that the Defendant has positively affirmed the Plaintiff to be a
Bankrupt. 2ly. There are general words in the former Action, namely alia
enormia, which words do comprehend the matter for which this Action is now
brought, and he denied the differences taken by the Council on the other side.
And it does here appear to the Court, that the former Action of Trespass was
brought for the same things, and damages were therein given for them, and it is
unreasonable to punish one twice for one and the same offense, and the averment
is good, and does show that both Actions are for one and the same cause, and he
has recovered damages already for all the wrong he sustained, and here is no
conversion alleged in the Case, nor is it vi et armis, and the Law hates double
vexation, 2. H. 6. f. 54. Brook brev. 397 3 H. 7. 4. Brook brev. 77. and
damages might well enough be recovered in the first Action, for all the damages
sustained, 19 H. 6. f. 44. And if this Action now brought, had been brought for
calling the Plaintiff Bankrupt, the Action would have lien; but not as it is
here brought, and one entire Action shall never be divided to put the party to
a double vexation, as it is in our case, 41 Ass. pl. 16. Brook brev. 309.^.
rep. Hudsons case, and in the first Action the words alia enormia were
purposely put in, that all matters touching that Trespass might be brought in
question, to increase the damages, 9 E 4. Brook Tresp. f. 1^9. and so all the
damages were recovered in the former Action. And he agreed Laicons case put by
Shafto, that the Plaintiff might recover damages as well for the value of the
Sheep, as for the chasing of them, and prays the Writ may be abated. Roll
chief Justice said, it is hard to maintain Laicons case; for cepit er abduxit
intends that the owner has not the Sheep again, otherwise it would be if the
Action had been for the driving of them only. And Mr. Shafto has taken a good
ground, viz. that the Actions are for several things, and the Declaration is
in part but an inducement to increase the scandal, and to prove it, and the
words alia enormia shall not be intended of collateral matter, but of matter
incident to the Act done; And one and the same thing may give several causes of
Action, and one Action is not to be confounded with another Action. Ierman
Justice said, Laicons Case was not like this Case for the question here is
whether the Plaintiff can recover damages in this second Action, which he has
by intendment recovered in the former Action, and he inclined that it may be so
here, and that there is a recovering of the same damages in diverse manners for
the same thing. Nicholas Justice said, he may bring several Actions, although
he might have joined them both in one. Ask Justice said, That one Act may be
divided into diverse Actions, and so it is here, and well enough. Roll chief
Justice said, the Plaintiff in this Action cannot recover damages for his
Goods, so that this Action is brought for another matter. Therefore plead in
chief if cause be not showed to the contrary, for the Action does well lie.

Meers against French.
Hll. 1649. Banc. Reg.
IN an ejectione firmae, Arrest of judgment in an ejectione fi^^ae.
and a verdict for the Plaintiff, The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment,
that there is no certainty in the Declaration neither of the place nor of the
quantity, nor of the quality of the Land whence the Plaintiff was ejected, for
it is e^dnobus Acris fundi, Anglice, a hopground, which is not warranted by the
Latin, and so it is uncertain, and it is also dimisit unum croftum, and a piece
of Land, and the quantity is not expressed, for it is per estimationem sive
plus sive minus, and medietatem sive unam partem is also uncertain. Twisden
answered, it was certain enough, because it is expressed by a certain name.
Declaration. Grant.
But Roll chief Justice said, it is good in grants; but not in a Declaration!
for there is required more certainty, and the Anglice here does not help it,
for the Anglice is not to interpret a Latin name by which it is called. And the
sive plus sive minus is also ill; but if it had been so many Acres per
estimationem, it had been good. Therefore advise better of it. Antea.

Vaux and Vaux against Draper.
Hill. 1649. Banc. sup.
Entered Trin. 1649. rot. 1104.
VAux and Vaux brought an Action upon the Case against Draper, Arrest of
Judgment in an action upon the case, upon a promise.
upon a promise, and declared, that the Defendant in consideration of ten
pounds paid by the Plaintifs unto the Defendant, did assume and promise unto
the Plaintifs, to procure certain Cattle of the Plaintifs taken from them by a
third person, to be redelivered unto them by such a time, and for not
performing this promise they brought their action. Upon Non assumpsit pleaded,
there was an issue joined, and a verdict found for the Plaintifs, after this
case had been twice spoken unto, The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment,
that th^^ Action was not well brought jointly by the Plaintifs, but that they
ought to have brought two several Actions, Joint action.
in regard that the promise upon which the Action was founded was not an entire
promise, but was a several promise made to each of the Plaintifs. The Council
on the other side prayed for Judgment, and said the promise was entire, made
to both, and not several, and so the Jury have found it, which shall be
intended to be true: and if it should not be so, it would be disadvantagious
for the Defendant. Hales said on the other side, that the assumpsit is several,
and the acts to be done by the Defendant to the Plaintifs are several, although
the assumpsit sounds as a joint assumpsit. Roll chief Justice said, That the
Consideration given is entire and cannot be divided, and there is no
inconvenience in joining in the Action in this case; but if one had brought the
Action alone, it might have been questionable. Nicholas and Ask Justices of the
same opinion. But Jerman Justice differed, and said, that they are several
promises, viz. to deliver such Cattle severally to each of them, as did belong
properly to them, and so there must be two several Actions. But Judgment was
given for the Plaintiff, except better matter showed. Antea.

Trin. 24. Car. rot. 1529.
THis case was again argued, Argument whether a lease well made according to
direction of Deed in trust.
by Hales for the Plaintiff, and by Twisden for the Defendant. I could not hear
Hales but imperfectly; Therefore I omit his Argument. Twisden, that argued for
the Defendant, put the case briefly thus. A Feofment was made of lands to I. S.
in fee, until he should make a lease of 21 years to A. B. from the feast of
Philip and Jacob; I. S. makes a lease for 21 years, to begin at the feast of
Philip and Jacob, And he held this was a good Lease, made according to the
direction of the Deed. 2ly, If it be not a good Lease, yet the use shall not
revert to the Feoffor. 3ly, He held that there is neither a good bargain and
sale, nor does it work by way of use. For the first point he held, if it had
been by way of pleading, it had not been good in pursuance of the Agreement:
otherwise it is being found by verdict; but here the agreement and the
intention of the parties is satisfied, and the variance is not considerable,
and de minimis non curat lex, 10 Iac. Hob. f. 120. 38 E. 3. f. 7. Waste 35.
2ly, In the Judgment and estimation of men, at and from are accounted to be
all one in signification. In the Stat. of 32 H. 8. it is so taken, and in the
Stat. of 27 H. 8. of enrollments, and words shall be construed according to
common intendment. And if there be a variance, yet the use rests in the
Feoffees, and shall not revert to the Feoffor: for the word until, is an Adverb
of time, Borastons case; Sir Andrew Corbets case, ^1 Rep. f. 85. Dyer 300. 3
Eliz. Mores Reports, 3 Iac. Sir Guy Fairfax case: if they make not the estate,
the estate remains in them. And if it do not remain in the Feoffees, yet it
cannot revert to the Feoffor, for he has conveyed from himself all the estate
that he had, and if it return to the Feoffor, it is a disseisin, 2 Rep. Butlers
case; And for the bargain and sale, that cannot be good; for here is no
Consideration, but that which is past, and not continuing, which is no good
Consideration, Plow. Com. 302.15 Car. Burton and Sherly. 2ly, The
Consideration, if there be any, is not meritorious, for ought any thing
appears, the moneys may not be discharged which are laid out, and so the
Defendant remains unsatisffed, and so there can be no Consideration, Allens
case, 23 Car. 3ly, If the debt be discharged, yet it cannot raise a use, for
here is no moneys, paid but a debt; And a use is not raised here, because it
was the intent of the parties to pass the land by way of bargain and sale, Ed.
Foxes case, 13 Eliz. Plowd. 32. 11 Car. Whitfield and Pierce, rot. 438. And if
one intend to pass an estate out of himself, he may do it either by the Common
law or by Statute law. Roll chief Justice said, if lands are passed for money
only, the deed ought to be enrolled; but if it be for money and natural
affection, Enrollment. Use.
it is not needful to enroll it, but the lands will pass without enrolment.
And so here the land passes one way or other; and if the use will rise all the
other points are out of doors. And there is here a continuing consideration to
raise a use. But the main question is whether the use rises to the Feoffor, if
not, all the other points are gone. And he held that here was only a mere
matter of trust, and the intent is not that the Feoffees shall have any thing
by the not performing the trust, but the use shall be to the Feoffor. And there
can be no disseisin in the case. And here is a material difference in point of
law, in the making of this lease, Lease.
for it is made for one day more then was agreed by the deed, for that lease
was to begin from the feast of Philip and Jacob; and this lease is made to be
begin at the Feast of Philip and Jacob. Ierman Justice held, that the intent of
the parties is performed, and that there is no material difference, and held
for the Defendant. Nicholas Justice said, here is no performance of the
agreement, for all the parties agreed not to this Lease, for it is made for
longer time than was agreed; and he held that the use shall be to the other
parties by contingency, and that here is no disseisin. Ask Justice said, all
the difficulty is whether the lease be made or not; and he held it was a good
lease according to the agreement, and said that the intent is not that the
Feoffees shall have any thing, but that it shall result to the Feoffor. Roll
chief Justice said, Intent.
the intent of the parties shall not be employed against the direct rules of
Law. Nil capiat per Billam nisi, etc.

PEndarvis brought an Action of Account against Dawkes for diverse sums of money

The Defendant pleads that as to all except ten pounds ne unques receptor; upon
this an issue was joined, and a verdict found for the Plaintiff. The Defendant
moved in arrest of Judgment, that it does not appear what ten pounds they are
that are menrioned in the plea; and so it is uncertain whether they be part of
the moneys, for which the Action is brought, Roll chief Justice said, he ought
to have expressed what ten pounds it is, for as it is, it is uncertain, and so
not good. Venire de novo.
Therefore take a venire facias de novo, for though the issue be not well
joined, yet the Declaration is good.

IN a writ of Error to reverse a judgment given in an Action of Debt upon an

One was bound in an Obligation (for the payment of certain sums of money) to a
Feme sole, the Feme takes Baron and dies. I. S. takes out Letters of
Administration of the goods and Chattels of the Feme, and brings an Action of
Debt upon the Obligation against the Obligor. The Obligor pleads that by the
entermariage of the Feme the Debt due upon the Obligation became due to the
Baron, and demands Judgment Si Actio, Chose in Action.
To this Plea the Plaintiff demurs. The Court said this Debt due upon the bond
became not due to the Husband, for it is a thing in Action, and therefore the
plea is not good.

Jones against Blunden.

Mich 1649. rot. 34.
THis Case formerly spoken to was again moved by Wild, Whether a good trial or

who held, that in regard that the matter triable arises from two places, and
so the venire may be from both places; yet it is well enough if it be from any
of them, and the Court has jurisdiction in both places, and therefore the
trial is well enough in this case. Twisden on the other side said, that here
are two issues in trial, and so it is not within the Statute of Ieofails; for
that is of force only where one issue is tried. Roll chief Justice answered,
here are not two issues, for you have made them one by pleading, and so it is
within the Statute of Ieofails, and helped by it. Ierman Justice to the same
intent: Issue. Ieofails.
and so Nicholas and Ask Justices. Roll chief Justice said, that the issue is
joined upon the matter arising in both places, and yet it is well enough; for
the principal matter was in S^. Clements Danes. Therefore let the judgment be
affirmed, except better matter be shown. Antea.

Adstone against Hunter.
Hill. 1469. Banc. sup.
ADston brought an Action upon the case against Hunter and his Wife for these
words spoken of the Plaintiff by Hunters wife, Arrest of Judgment in an Action
on the Case.
viz. Jane Adstone did bewitch my good man, innuendo her Husband. Upon Not
guilty pleaded, and a Verdict found for the Plaintiff, it was moved in Arrest of
judgment that the words were too general, and uncertain, to raise any scandal,
and therefore an Action could not be brought for speaking of them. Shaftoe of
Council with the Plaintiff held that the words are actionable, because they
declare an Act or thing done, and the party is scandalized by the words, 4 rep.
^eames his case, and the words my good man are words well known to express her
Husband by, as 7 Iac. to say, Thou art a healer of Felons, was well understood
to mean a Concealer of Felons; and if the words good man be uncertain, yet they
are certain enough to show that some body is bewitched, for the Act done is
certainly enough expressed, and the Plaintiff is thereby scandalized, and
besides it is after a Verdict, and by it they are made certain, and damages are
given for speaking them, Mich. 15 Car. Com. Banc. Stones case rot ^36. Roll
chief Justice said, These words, Thou have bewitched a man are actionable, and
it is a scandal to say, One has killed a man by Witchcraft, and he held the
words actionable. Ierman Justice said, they could not be actionable, because by
them there is no act of witchcraft expressed. Nicholas Justice said, the words
are not actionable for thou have bewitched one may be spoken in a good sense,
and words are but wind, and spoken in passion sometimes, and other times in
Jest or merriment. Ask Justice said, that the words tend to scandal as they are
spoken, Averment.
and shall be intended that she has bewitched one by Diabolical Art. And Roll
chief Justice said, It is not necessary to aver what Act of Witchcraft was
done. And these words, Thou have bewitched me and my Aunt have been adjudged
Actionable in this Court. It was adjourned to be argued again the next term.

Upon a rule to show cause why a Judgment should not be reversed, To amend a

the Court was moved that the Roll wherein the Error assigned was might be
amended according to the Original which is right, though the Nisi prius Roll be
not so. Holhead on the other side prayed there might be no amendment, but the
Judgment reversed, for if Judgment be given upon an erroneous Declaration,
which is the ground of the Action, as it is here, it is not good, nor is
amendable. The Court answered, this is the fault of the Clark, who had the
original before him, which is the ground of all, Amendment.
and by which he ought to form the Declaration. But the matter is that here it
is after a Verdict, and it will be perilous to attaint the Jury, though it
being the Clarks fault, it be amendable. But let it rest till the next term,

Mich. 1649. rot. 428.
Williamson brought an Action upon the Case against Meade, Arrest of Judgment
is an action upon an Assumpsit.
and declared upon three Assumpsits made by the Defendant to the Plaintiff, that
the Defendants son should pay such a sum of money to the Plaintiff for his
boarding with him, when he should be thereunto required; upon non Assumpsit
pleaded, and a verdict for the Plaintiff, the Defendant moved in Arrest of
Judgment, That the Plaintiff does not show that he did require the Son to pay
the sum of money, which the Defendant did assume should be paid upon request;
but only says that the Defendant licet saepius requisitus non solvit. The
Judgment was arrested till cause should be shown to the contrary. The same day
it was moved again, and the Council urged that the request was not necessary to
be made, and prayed for judgment. But Roll Chief Justice answered, that this
was a collateral promise, Request.
and therefore the request must be averred to be made to the Son. Therefore the
Plaintiff can have no judgment, and so nil capiat per billam was ruled to be
entered.

Hudson.
Hill. 1649. Banc. sup.
THe Court was moved that there was a scire facias issued out to certify
Errors, For time to assign Errors.
and time was desired to assign them. But the Court answered, the bringing of
the writ of Error is delay enough; and therefore if you have not assigned the
Errors according the rules of the Court, they shall not be now accepted.

THe Court was moved upon an Affidavit that the Defendant might plead and go
to trial, That an Attorney might be forced to plead. Plea. Appearance.
because his Attorney has appeared; and now he says he is not an Attorney of

appeared, and yet will not plead, enter your judgment against this Clyent, and
though he have not appeared, if he did promise to appear we will force him to
do it

VVhitchurch against Pagot.
Hill. 1649. Banc. sup.
THe Court was moved in the behalf of Whitchurch a Clerk of this Court, To be
restored to a Clerks place in the Castes Brevium Office.
that he might be restored to his Office in the Office of the Custos brevium,
according to an Order of this Court, otherwise that he may have liberty to
bring his Action against the Custos brevium. The Court answered, that the
Master of the Office is answerable for all his Clerks, and has power over
them, and they are not Officers but mere Servants, and therefore there is no
remedy to be had in Law against him, Restitution.
but in Conscience he ought to restore him. Therefore let him show cause next
Term why he should not be restored.

In Michaelmas Term 1654. After diverse motions and hearing what was objected on
both sides upon his submission in Court to Mr. Paget the Master of the Office
he promised to restore him.

Mich 1649. Banc. sup.
THe Court was moved in Arrest of Judgment that the Plaintiff was 19 years old,
Arrest of Judgment for pleading per Guardianum.
and sued per guardianum, which ought not to be; for after he is 17 years years
old he ought to sue per Attornatum suum. The Court answered, this is no good
exception, for if he be within the age of 21 years, he may sue per guardianum,
and he is admitted by the Court to do so. And therefore let the Plaintiff take
his Judgment.

Bigford against Topsam.
Pasc. 16^^. Banc. sup.
Mich. 1649 rot. 85.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in an Action of Debt
upon an obligation with the condition for the payment of a certain sum of money
after the return of the Ship, Error to reverse a judgment in debt.
to the Port of Plymouth. The Defendant pleaded a special plea, to which the
Plaintiff demurred, and upon this demurrer the Judgment was given for the
Plaintiff, upon which Judgment the writ of Error was brought. Wadha^^ Windham
assigned for error, 1. That there issued a pone out of the Cou^^ of Plymouth,
returnable the 1 of March, and the Defendant did not appear till the 8 of
March, and so there is a discontinuance. Hales of Council on the other side,
answered, that the Plaintiff had accepted of a Declaration, Discontinuance.
and so that fault is helped. The Court answered, the acceptance of the
Declaration does not help it; But the Record is not so, therefore passes
ouster. A 2d. Exception was, that there is no bail taken, Bail.
for it is erroneous bail, and so shall be accounted no bail. The Court
answered, this is not material here. A 3d. Exception was, that it is said that
the plea was held before the then Mayor, and does not show that he was elected.
The Court answered, it is well enough as it is, though it might have been
otherwise. It was adjourned.

Custodes Libertat. etc. against Mountain and Lydal.
Pasc. 1649. Banc. sup.
AN information was exhibited by the Attorney general against the Defendants
for engrossing diverse Acres of Corn. Demurrer to a plea to an information for
engrossing
They pleaded that they had been heretofore prosecuted in the Court of the
Exchequer, and were acquitted thereof. To this plea the Attorney general
demurred, and these reasons were showed why the plea was not good. 1. It is not
pleaded that they were acquitted by judgment, or upon a verdict, or upon a
former information exhibited against them. 2ly. It does not appear that the
Exchequer had jurisdiction of the cause. 3ly. There could be no information
duly exhibited, for it is said to be the 10. of September, which is out of the
Term, and so the Court did not sit. 2ly. there is no issue joined, for the
Plaintiff says, ponit se, etc whereas it being by way of recital, ought to
have been posuit se, and the other says petiit quod inquiratur per patriam.
3ly. There is no verdict in the Case, for the issue is non culp. contra
Statutum, and the verdict is non est culp. juxta Statutum. 4ly. There is no
judgment, for it is eat ad praesens, and it ought to be iret ad tunc. 5ly.
There is no averment, that the first information was for the same offense. 6ly.
The information ought to be in the same County, by the Statute of 21 Jac. and
the Barons of the Exchequer are not Judges by the Statute, and so prays
Judgment against the Defendant. Hales of Council with the Defendant answered
to the third exception. That in the Exchequer there is a Court the 10. of
September to receive informations, although it be out of the Term time. And he
said there is a good issue joined, and a good verdict, for the words juxta et
contra in this place have one and the same sense. And the Judgment is also
good. And the information was well brought in the Exchequer, notwithstanding
the Statute of 21 Jac. for the offense was in Midlesex where the Exchequer is.
Also if the Judgment be not good by reason of Error, yet it shall be accounted
good, till it be avoided by plea: And although it be erroneous, yet here is a
discontinuance; for Mich. 24 Car. St. John was chief Justice of the Commons
Pleas, and not solliciter, as the plea supposes. The Court answered, that they
cannot take notice of that: And here is no issue joined, nor any continuance to
part of the plea pleaded by the Defendant, and the demurrer goes not to the
plea, upon which the party puts himself upon the Country, and there is no
demurrer to that. The demurrer is referred to the last plea, and not to all,
and so there is a discontinuance to part, and the first Judgment is not void,
until it be avoided by plea, and here the fact was done in the County where
the Exchequer is, Void and ^oideable. Discontinuance. C^r^^orari.
and so the Barons are Judges of it by the Statute, and a fine that is
voideable is not void, until it be made so by pleading. And if you cannot
answer the discontinuance, all the rest is to no purpose, therefore take time
to answer that. It was said also by the Court, that the Defendant may remove an
information exhibited against him, out of any County to the Courts at
Westminster, notwithstanding the Statute.

Hamond against Kingsmill.
Pasc. 1649. Banc. sup.
HAmond a Justice of peace brought an Action upon the Case against Kingsmill,
Arrest of in an action ^^r words.
for speaking these several words of him, viz. Mr Hamond did of his own head
put into Mores confession that he stole the Lambs. And 2ly. That he was a
debauched man, and is not fit to be a Justice of Peace. Upon not guilty
pleaded, and a verdict for the Plaintiff, The Defendant moved in Arrest of
Judgment that none of the words were actionable, or at least the last words
are not, and so Judgment cannot be given. For the first words he said, they
ought to be taken in mitiori sensu, and they may have a good construction, viz.
that he framed the confession without being helped by any other body. And for
the second words that he was a debanched man they cannot touch his office at
the present; Mich. 24, and 25. Eliz. C. Banc. 1. because they are spoken in the
preterperfect tence, and not in the present tence. The Court said that the
words, was a debauched man, are uncertain words. Therefore take Judgment for
the first words, and nil capiat per billam for the second, except cause showed
to the contrary.

Iennings against Lee.
Pasc. 1649. Banc. sup.
IEnnings brought an Action of Assault and Battery against Lee, For a repleader
because an immaterial issue joined.
The Defendant pleaded non cul. to the Battery, and pleaded a special
justification as to the Assault. It was prayed there might be a repleader
granted, because the issue joined is immaterial. The Council on the other side
prayed for Judgment. Wild held, that there is an Issue joined, for the Record
faith so, and the Jury have found the Issue, and if it be ill, it is not helped
by the Statute, and so there can be no Judgment. All issues are not joined by
an express affirmative, and an express negative, for if it be but by
implication it is good enough. An immaterial Issue is not helped by the
Statute; but an informall issue is helped, and here the issue is immaterial, 32
Eliz. Lovelace and Griffin, rot. 934. Trin. 22 Car. Coals case, rot. 932 Banc.
Reg. 23 Car. More and Clipson, and prays for a repleader. Sergeant Parker on
the other side said, the cases cited were not to the purpose as to the Case at
the Bar, for here is a good issue joined to one thing pleaded, if not to the
rest. Roll chief Justice held, that where there is an immaterial issue, there
ought to be a Repleader, and it is not helped by the Statute, and there can be
no Judgment, for the matter is not putin trial, Repleader.
and for this cause, it would be unreasonable to give Judgment, Ieofail. Issue.
and this is an immaterial issue, Trin. 9 Car. entered Mich. 8 Car. rot. 366.
Tailor and Sparks, an affirmative and an employed negative make a good issue,
though it be not an express negative. Therefore replead.

Hurd against Lenthall.

Entered Mi h. 1649. rot. 568.
Upon a special verdict in an ejectione firmae, Question upon the words of a
will whether a joyntenancy or a tenancy in Common.
The Case upon the words of a Will was this, Lands were devised to two
daughters equally to be divided, and to the Surviver of them, and to the Heirs
of the Body of the Surviver of them. Maynard held that here is a joyntenancy,
because otherwise the Will cannot take effect in all parts. Hales held that
there is a tenancy in Common, and not a joyntenancy, nor any cross remainders.
Roll Chief Justice said, That the words equally to be divided in a Will,
Ioyntenant. Tenant in common.
do make a tenancy in Common by construction, but in a grant it would be
otherwise; but here upon the entire Will it does not appear that the Lands
should be divided; but that there should be a Surviver. And the Land was
intended for a security for a portion, and that the devise should stand till
the monyes should be paid. And in a Will the last words of it do explain the
first words; but it is not so in a grant. Will. Grant.
All the Judges agreed in opinion with the chief Justice, and Judgment was
given for the Plaintiff nisi causa, etc.

exhibited in that Court, against a Woodmonger of London, grounded upon an Act

if the Act of Common Council be against Law, we may grant a Certiorari.
Adjourned till Friday next to hear Council on both sides.

Lamb against Duff.
Pasc. 16^^. Banc. sup.
Upon an Affidavit the Court was informed that Lamb had arrested Duff after a
verdict found for Lamb against him, to the intent, For false practice.
that he may have him in Custody, when the Judgment is entered against him, and
for no other cause, as appears by his own confession, and it was therefore
prayed the party may be set at large. The Court made answer, that this was a
strange and an irregular course, and ought not to be. If one take out a latitat
against one, and have no cause of Action against him, the party may have an
Action of the Case for it. Case. Attach nt.
Take an attachment if he will not discharge the party, or else let him show

Whetstone, Demurrer to a plea in debt upon a single obligation. Bar. Abatement.
The Defendant pleaded payment of part of the sum, since the Action brought, in
Bar of the Action. To this Plea the Plaintiff demurred. The Court answered the
plea was not good in Bar of the Action; but in abatement of the Writ it had
been good. Therefore let the Defendant show cause why Judgment should not be
against him upon the demurrer.

Gibbon against Kent.

Pasch. 24 Car. rot. 60.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in the Common Pleas,
Error to reverse a judgment in debt upon the Statute of 2 Ed. 6
in an Action of Debt brought upon the Statute of 2. Ed. 6. for the not setting
forth of Tithes. The Errors assigned were, 1. That it does not appear that the
Lands sowed do lie in the Parish that is laid in the Declaration. 2ly. The
Plaintiff has not entitled himself well to his Action, for the Statute of 3^
H. 8. is taken away by the Statute of 13 Eliz. 3ly. The Statute is not well
pleaded, for it is pleaded too generally, and not in the several circumstances
thereof, as it ought to be. The Court commanded the Record to be read, and upon
Dyer of it, answered, That 2 Churches united by the Statute, are both of
spiritual promotion. And the Statute of 12 Eliz does not repeal the Statute of
38 H. 8. But let the party show cause why the Judgment should not be reversed,
Repeal.

AN Action of Debt was brought upon a Bond taken by a Sheriff, D^mu^^er to a
plea in debt upon a Sheriffs Bond.
for the Defendant to appear in Chancery upon an Attachment issued out thence
against him. The Defendant pleads the Statute of 23 H. 6. That the Sheriff
ought not to take Bonds of any, but in special cases, and that this Bond is
void, because it is taken against the Statute. To this plea the Plaintiff
demurred. The question was whether an Atatchment out of the Chancery, be within
the Statute of 23 H. 6. The Court ordered cause to be shown why Judgment
should not be given for the Plaintiff upon this Demurrer. Postea.

VIccarye, being a Mercer by his Trade, Arrest of Judgment for words.
brought an Action upon the Case against Barns for speaking these words of him,
viz. Thou art a Cuckold, and a Cuckoldly Rascal, and do owe more than thou
art worth, and are not able to pay thy debts: Upon non culp. pleaded, and an
issue joined, and a verdict found for the Plaintiff, it was moved in Arrest of
Judgment, that the words are not actionable; for, for the first part of the
words they are clearly not actionable, and for the latter words they do not
imply any shifting fraud or falsehood, and so cannot imply him to be a Bankrupt;
for though he do owe more than he is worth, and is not able to pay his debts,
yet he may be an honest man, and he may have credit and friends to support him
in his trade. Apes and More, Pasch. 15 Car. and Jones and Jacob, ^4 Car. The
Court answered, here is no fraud or deceit employed, which do make a Bankrupt
within all the Statutes touching Bankrupts; and if there be a special loss
alleged, the words will be actionable, otherwise not. Bankrupt.
But let Judgment stay till the other side move, and bring us a book, for the
words are worthy consideration. Postea.

Barnestone against Gale.
Pasch. 1649. Banc. sup.
AN Action of Trespass was brought for chasing of the Plaintifs Hogs; Arrest of
Judgment in Trespass.
the Defendant by way of justification pleads a special plea, viz. That he did
hunt them with a Dog by the command of his Master, because the Plaintiff did put
them into his Masters ground to eat the Acorns there. The Plaintiff replied that
he had Common there: Upon this an Issue was joined, and a Verdict found for the
Plaintiff. Replication.
The Defendant moved in Arrest of Judgment upon this exception, that the
Plaintiff in his replication has not answered the bar, for he prescribes only
for Common of Pasture, and pannage is no pasture, and so he has no right to
the Acorns. But Roll chief Justice said, If they have cause to eat the Grass,
they may also eat the Acorns there, for they may be on the grounds, and
therefore it is a good justification. And therefore let the Plaintiff have
Judgment, except cause be shown to the contrary.

Bolton against Wills.
Pasch. 1649. Banc. sup.
AN Action upon the Case was brought upon an indebitatus Assumpsit for a
hundred and ninety Weathers sold by the Plaintiff unto the Defendant at 18 s.
Arrest of Judgment in an Action upon the Case upon an Assumpsit.
a sheep, which in all amounts to 190 l. Upon an Issue joined, and a Verdict
for the Plaintiff, It was moved in Arrest of Judgment that the Declaration is
not good, but mistakes the promise, for the Weathers promised to be paid for,
do not amount to the sum for which the Declaration is laid. And also the issue
is taken upon the immaterial part of the plea, and the matter well pleaded is
waived. The Court answered, That mistaking of a Judgment is a mistake of the
Clark, and is not material; Amendment.
but here the Declaration it self is mistaken, and that is material; for the
Action is grounded upon the promise in Law, upon the sale of the Sheep,
Declaration.
and not upon any new Contract, and by the sale there wants 2 s. in every Sheep
to make up the sum demanded, therefore the Declaration is repugnant. Nil capiat
per billam, nisi, etc.

More against the Earl Rivers.

Mich. 1649. rot. 588.
Wilson of Council with More the Plaintiff, argued against the Plea of Peerage
pleaded by the Earl Rivers, as it is pleaded, and took these Exceptions.
Argument against the plea of Peerage.
1. It appears not here by the Retorn by what Warrant the Earl was committed,
and brought hither, and so he has no day in Court, and so the Plea is not
good. 2ly. It is not showed by virtue of what Warrant he was taken. 3ly. The
Plea is, 1. In abatement of the writ. 2ly. In avoidance of the Act of the
Judge, and the latter ought not to be questioned by Plea. 3ly. There is no
Plea, but bare words, for he pleads the Common Law. 4ly. He pleads his Patent
as Earl, only by way of Argument. 5ly. He ought to show the writ under the
Seal, testifying the matter, 8 H. 6. f. 9. 6ly. The investiture of the Earldom
is the livery and seisin of the Earldom, and he has omitted the pleading the
Ceremonies of the investing, and so he does not show that he is an Earl. By the
Statute Law, Capias.
viz. of E. 3. a Capias was given in debt, and before that a Summons was the
process. The Council on the other side said they had demurred to the Plea,
Summons.
and showed the cause of their Demurrer; but the Court reproved them, because
they had ruled the matter in Law should be argued at the Bar to enform their
own Judgments. Adjournatur Postea.

Syms against Wilson.

Pasch. 23 Car. rot. 120.
SYms brought an action upon the Case upon the Statute of Monopolies against
Wilson. Demurrer to a Plea in Bar in an Action upon the case.
The Defendant pleaded the Statute of limitations of Actions in Bar of the
Action to this Plea, the Plaintiff demurred. Hales held that this action
grounded upon the Statute is not within the Statute of limitations of Actions
of 21 Iac. because it is not a mere Action on the Case at the Common Law, but
an Action upon the Case grounded upon the Statute of Monopolies. But Twisden on
the other side said that a Monopoly is an offense at the Common Law, Monopoly.
for which an Action of the Case did lie before the Statute, and that the
Statute was made but to inflict a greater punishment for the offense, and so it
is within the Statute of limitations of Actions. And 2ly. the very words of the
Statute say, that all Actions shall be brought within six years, and he that
says all without limitation, Statu^e of limitations.
excludes none, and by consequence this Action is not excluded. 3ly. The end of
the Statute of limitations was to quiet sales, and therefore the Statute shall
be largely interpreted, because made for so public a good. Adjourned to the
next term to be argued again.

such Actions may be commenced as well by Bill as by Original.

Pasch. 1649. Banc. sup.
LEtchmore moved to quash an Inquisition taken against one upon the Statute of
West. 2. for the throwing down of Enclosures. To quash an Inquisition denied.
But the Court answered, that it was not proper to move to quash the
Inquisition, because the Defendant came in upon process, and therefore he must
either traverse or plead to the Inquisition. Letchmore replied, that the
Inquisition was so uncertain, that the Defendant could not tell how to plead to
it. Plea. Traverse.
But the Court answered, he might plead to the Distringas, And that the moneys
already levied for the offense should rest in the Sherifs hand until the trial.

Hill. 1649. rot. 818.
Upon a Verdict given in an Ejectione firmae, Arrest of Judgment in an
Ejectine firmae.
It was moved in Arrest of Judgment, that the Plaintiff declares that the
Defendant ejected him ex uno Cottagio, whereas an Ejectione firmae lies not of
a Cottage, no more than a praecipe quod reddat lies of a Cottage. But the Court
answered, that an ejectment does lie of a Cottage, because the description of
the thing by that name is sufficient and certain enough to show the Sherif of
what to deliver the possession of; Ejectment. Recovery.
yet it was said that a recovery lies not of a Cottage. Rethorick and Chapels
case 10 Iac. was cited that an Ejectione lies of a Cottage, and also a praecipe
quod reddat.

VVood against Topham.
Pasch. 1649. Banc. sup.
VVOod brought an Action upon the Case against Topham, quare filium suum and
haeredem rapuit et maritavit, Arrest of Judgment in an action upon the case.
and obtained a Verdict against the Defendant. In Arrest of judgment moved for
the Defendant, these exceptions were taken against the Declaration. 1. That it
does not say haeredem apparentem, but only filium and haeredem. 2ly. It does
not say rapuit contra voluntatem, but only rapuit. 3ly. It does not set forth
that the heir was within age. 4ly. It does not say Cujus maritagium ad ipsum
pertiner. But the last Exception only was insisted upon. Wilmot of Council with
the Plaintiff, to prove that that Exception was not material, cited one Grayes
case Pasch. 29 Eliz. Banc. reg. and the Books of 12 H. 4. f. 16. and 23 E. 3.
Brook Tit. Trespass 43. But Hales urged that the last Exception was not
answered. Case.
Roll chief Justice said, That an Action quare filium and haeredem suum rapuit
will lie, although the heir be of full age; for the Father has the marriage of
his Son although he have no estate to leave unto him. Adjourned to the next
Term. Postea. 227.

Dawkes versus Payton.
Pasch. 1469. Banc. sup.
Pasch 1650. rot. 306.
AN Infant brought an Action in this Court, Error brought in the Upper Bench
upon a Judgment given there.
and had a Verdict and a Judgment, the Defendant brought a writ of Error in
the same Court to reverse this judgment, and it was assigned for Error that
the Infant brought his Action in propria persona, whereas he ought to have sued
per guardianum, and this is Error at the Common Law, and is not helped by the
Statute of Ieofails; and it was argued that the writ of Error may be well
brought in this Court to reverse a judgment given here, if the Error assigned
be matter in fact, as it is in this case, for by such a writ of Error the
judgment of the Court is not called in question, as it would be if the Error
assigned were matter in Law; and these Books were cited, Error.
viz. 7 H. 6. 28. Dyer 196. Mich. 25, and 26. Eliz. Banc. reg. Hales on the
other side argued that the writ of Error did not lie. And he made 2 questions,
1. Whether the writ of Error did lie at all. 2ly. If it did lie in an other
Term; and he said, that admitting the writ of Error does lie, yet it ought to
have been brought the same Term wherein the judgment was given; but so it is
not here, and therefore it is not well brought: And 2ly. If the Error assigned
be Error, yet it is helped by the Statute of 21 Iac. of Ieofails. But if it be
not, yet the Error assigned here is not assignable; for it does not appear
whether the party appeared per guardianum or not, for the party is a privileged
person. The Court answered, we cannot know whether the party be within age or
of full age, and therefore know not whether he ought to appear by Attorney or by
Guardian; but for Error in matter of fact, in a judgment given in this Court,
a writ of Error will lie here well enough, and it is all one whether the writ
be brought the same Term, or in another Term. But bring us Books and we will
advise, Postea.

Viccarye against Barnes.
Pasch. 1650. Banc. sup.
AN Action upon the case was brought by a Mercer against the Defendant, for
speaking these words of him, Thou art a Cuckold, Arrest of Judgment in an
Action upon the Case for words.
and a Cuckoldly Rascal, and art not able to pay thy debts, and art not worth a
Groat. The Plaintiff had a Verdict, and upon a motion in Arrest of judgment,
because the words were supposed not actionable, the judgment was formerly
stayed till the Plaintiff should move. At this day Pepes for the Plaintiff prays
for judgment, because he held the words were actionable, and cited one Bragges
Case, adjudged, and said that the Plaintiff had laid a special damage by the
words. Windham on the other side said, That the Plaintiff had not laid any
special damage as Pepes supposes, but only allegeth a general damage, namely,
that he by speaking of the words lost his credit, and could not buy wares upon
trust as he used to do before, but only for ready money, and so there can be no
issue joined. Ierman Justice held the words actionable, and also Roll the chief
Justice, for he said it was a hinderance to him in his Trade to be so spoken
of, although they bring him not within the Statute of Bankrupt, and he cited 11
Car. Iackson and Hewes his case, where an Action was brought by Iackson being a
Grasier, against Hewes, for saying of him Thou art a base beggarly Rogue, and
art not able to pay thy debts. Nicholas Justice held the words actionable, but
Ask Justice doubted, for such words may peradventure be true, it they be spoken
of a young Tradesman that begins with little. And said that the chief question
is whether the averment of the damage be well alleged; and he held it was not,
because it was so general that no issue can be joined upon it. Roll chief
Justice said, the words are found by the Verdict to be spoke falso et
malitiose, And therefore let the Plaintiff have his Judgment except better
matter be showed.

Pasch. 1650. Banc. sup.
AN Information was exhibited in this Court against one for engrossing of Hay,

an Information at his own charge denied. Indictment. Information.
the Plaintiff moved that the Defendant might, be ordered to carry the cause
down to be tried at the Assizes at his own charge. But the Court answered that
they could make no such Order, because the suit was not upon an Endictment,
which is at the suit of the Custodes, but upon an information, which is at the
suit of the party.

Cater against Startute.
Trin. 1650. Banc. sup.
Hill. 1649. rot. 1025.
THe Plaintiff brought an Action of Debt upon an Obligation to stand to an
award: The Defendant pleaded that there was no award made; Demurrer to a
replication in debt upon an Obligation to stand to an award.
The Plaintiff replies that there was an award made, and sets forth the award,
and assigns the breach; Upon this the Defendant demurs, and for cause shows
that part of the award was, that one of the parties should make such a general
release to the other as Council should advise, so that the Council are made
Arbitrators, in regard that a judicial act is referred to them, which ought not
to be; for the Arbitrators cannot delegate their authority to others,
Ministerial. Act Judicial.
and 8 E. 4. f. 10. was cited to this purpose. But Wild on the other side said,
that the referring of the making of the releases to Council was warrantable,
because it is but a ministerial act, and not a judicial, as is objected. Roll
chief Justice said, that there is no judicial thing left for the Council to do,
but only a ministerial act, and therefore it is well enough; but it had been
otherwise had it been a judicial act, for that had been for the Arbitrators to
delegate their anthority to others, which is not warrantable, because it is
contrary to the submission of the parties, but to delegate a ministerial act is
not contrary; And with him the Court agreed, and ordered the Plaintiff to take
his Judgment, except better matter were shown Saturday next.

Dawkes against Payton.
Trin. 1650. Banc. sup.
Pasch. 1650. rot. 306.
AN Action was ordered out of the Chancery to be tried in this Court; Whereupon
the cause was tried, Error to reverse a judgment in the Upper Bench. upon an
issue directed out of the Chancerie.
and a Judgment upon a Verdict was given for the Plaintiff. The Defendant
brings a writ of Error here to reverse this judgment. The first question was,
whether it did sufficiently appear by the Record, whether the party did appear
in person or by Guardian. Hales held that it did not appear, but that it
belongs to the other party to show it; for he ought to have all the Record upon
which the Error is assigned. A second question was, Whether the Error assigned,
if it be Error, be not helped after a Verdict by the Statute of 21 Iac. Hales
held, that however the party appeared, whether by Guardian, or in proper
person, it is helped by the Statute of 21 Iac. and cannot be assigned here for
Error, and the writ of Error that is brought is as well to reverse the
judgment given here, as the former judgment given in Chancery, which cannot
be, for this Court cannot reverse their own Judgment, except it be for Error
in process, 1^ H. 6. 2. 44. 7 H. 6. f. 28. nor can this Court reverse their own
judgment for Error in fact, because it is to overthrow their own act, yet the
Chequer chamber may do it; yet there it is more proper to appeal to the
Parliament; and he said, that the Cases of 2 Rich. 3. f. 1. and Dyer 1^5.
cited, to be resolved, have been since disputed, and so prayed the writ of
Error might abate. Roll chief Justice said, that for the first matter, whether
it appears by the assignment of the party, whether the appearance were per
Guardianum, Appearance.
or otherwise, we will not imagine either Attorney or Guardian in the Case, but
that he appeared in propria persona, because nothing to the contrary appears by
the Record, Error.
and if it be otherwise you ought to have shown it. And for the matter, whether
it be Error to appear by Attorney, where the party ought to appear by his
Guardian, he held it was Error, and that it is not helped by the Statute of 21
Iac. because it is more dangerous for an Infant to appear in propria persona,
or per Guardianum, than per Attornatum; for against an Attorney he may have
remedy, but not against himself or his Guardian; and this is casus omissus out
of the Statute. And as to the question, Casus omissus
whether this Court may reverse their own judgment, he held, that they may for
Error in matter of fact, as the case here is, though they cannot for Error in
matter in Law, as was adjudged, Mich. 25. rot. 96. and Mich. 5 Jac. in Watkins
and Giffins case, and if it should not be so here, the party would be without
remedy, for he can have no remedy in the Chequer Chamber, and there is no
president in Parliament be to relieved there, and it is neither against reason
nor any Rule of Law for this Court to do it. Upon this the Council moved to
quash the writ of Error upon an exception taken to it, as it was entered in the
Record, but because it was but a mis-entry, the writ it self being right,
Amendment.
the Record was ordered to be amended by the Writ.

Roberrs and Tucker.

Pasch 18. Car. rot. 116.
THe Court was moved to quash a writ of Error, because the writ was to remove a
Record coram Majori et Recordatori, To quash a Writ of Eror.
whereas the Record certified was a Record coram Majori et Deputato
recordatori. Roll chief Justice, the Record is not well removed, why may you
not have a new Certificate upon the same writ? But that cannot be, and
therefore you must have a special writ directed to remove the Record before the
Mayor and the Deputy Recorder; Alteration.
for if there be a special cause to alter the usual form of a writ, the
Cursitors ought not to hold themselves to the old presidents, but are
compellable to alter them if the case require. Abatement.
Therefore let the writ be abated, and take another Writ. Vid. ante^.

Hill. 1649. rot. 438.
SHertlife brought an Action of Debt against Tymberlye upon an Obligation,
Demurrer to ^ Plea in debt upon an Obligation to save harmless.
the condition whereof was, that the Defendant should save the Plaintiff
harmless from such a person, and should release unto him all his right in
certain goods: The Defendant pleads that he had saved the Plaintiff harmless,
and had released unto him all his right in the goods, and to this plea the
Plaintiff demurred, and shows for cause that the Defendant ought to have showed
how he had saved the Plaintiff harmless, because the condition was in the
affirmative. To which the Court agreed, because he might have pleaded generally
in the negative, viz. non damnificatus, and that had been good, and therefore
judgment was given against the Defendant. Non damnificatus.


Hobson against Hudson.
Trin. 1650. Banc. sup.
HObson brought an Action upon the Case against Hudson for these words, Thou
wentest to the Wells to be cured of the Pox: Arrest of Judgment in an Action
for words.
The Plaintiff had a Verdict against the Defendant, who moved in Arrest of
Judgment that the words were not actionable, because they were too general and
uncertain. But Roll chief Justice, and Nicholas and Ask Justices held they were
actionable. But Ierman Justice doubted, because the party that went to the
Wells to be cured might suspect he had the Pox though he had them not, But
Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

Elsy agginst Mawdit.

ELsye brought an Action upon the case against Mawdit for speaking these words

Thou Sirrah art a rogue and a runaway rogue, and did run away from Oxford,
and art a rogue upon Record at Oxford. The Plaintiff upon not guilty pleaded
had a verdict, the Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment that the words were
general, and uncertain, and not actionable the Court thereupon stayed Judgment
till the Plaintiff should move. The Plaintiff at another day moves by, Hales of
his Council for Judgment, who said that the words are actionable, or at least
some of them, for thou art a rogue upon Record are actionable words, and that
is part of the words. The Court inclined also that they were actionable, yet
would advise. Postea. The same Term Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

Chase and Jones against Lovering.
Trin. 1650. Banc. sup.
CHase and Jones brought an Action upon the case against Lovering, Arrest of
judgment in an action upon the case upon a pr^mise.
upon a promise made by the Defendant to the Plaintiffs to pay unto them 84 l.
out of the freight of a Ship and for not paying it the Plaintiffs bring their
Action. Upon non assumpsit pleaded there was an issue joined, and a verdict
found for the Plaintiffs. The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, and
allegeth for cause that the Plaintiffs averment in their Declaration of the non
payment of the 84 l. is not good, Averment.
for it does not appear by the averment that there was any freight due for the
Ship, out of which the moneys were to be paid. Roll chief Justice answered,
that the Plaintiff ought to have averred that there were moneys due for the
freight of the Ship, otherwise how can it be known whether there be any monyes
due to be paid out of them, therefore the averment is very uncertain, to whom
Ierman Nicholas and Ask Justices agreed. Roll Chief Justice added, that it is
part of the promise that the money shall be paid out of the freight, and as the
averment is; the matter cannot stand together, and here is no demand for the
monyes to be paid out of the freight. Therefore against the Plaintiff let there
be a nil capiat per billam entered.

Blackden against Harvye.

Hill. 1649. rot. 928.
BLackden brought an Action upon the Case, upon an indebitatus assumpsit to pay
unto him 9 l. upon delivery of certain Cloth against Harvy as Executor of I.
S. Demurrer upon a plea af er imparlance.
The Defendant appeared and imparled; and after imparlance pleads in abatement
of the Writ, that I. S. made other Executors together with the Defendant, who
ought to have been named in the Writ. The Plaintiff denturs, and for cause
shows, 1. That the Plaintiff does not show what goods the Defendant
administered, nor at what time he administered any, as he ought, and 6. lac
Edwards and Foyes case was cited to prove it. A second cause of the demurrer
was, that the plea in abatement of the Writ is after imparlance, which is not
good, because it is touching a thing in the Defendants knowledge, and so he
might have pleaded it before imparlance, as it is 35 H. 6. f. 36. Ierman
Justice absente Roll answered, that the first exception is not material;
Abatement.
but he held that the second was a good exception, and that the Defendant
cannot plead in abatement after imparlance, for by his imparlance he has
admitted the Writ good. Therefore'plead in chief if cause be not showed to the
contrary on Friday next

VVinter against Barnard.
Trin. 1650. Banc. up.
VVInter brought an Action upon the Case against Barnard, Arrest of judgment
in an action for words.
and declared, that upon the rumor that a Bastard Child was drownded. The
Defendant said to the Plaintiff, I do verily believe the Bastard Child was
thine, nay it was thine; upon not guilty pleaded an issue was joined, and a
verdict found for the Plaintiff: It was moved in arrest of Judgment that the
words are not actionable, as they are laid for that it does not appear that
there was a Bastard Child drowned, for the Declaration is that there was only a
rumor, that a Bastard Child was drowned. But all the Court agreed, that by the
conference set forth in the Declaration, it is agreed that there was a Bastard
Child, and it is a scandal to the party, whether there were a Bastard Child or
no, and if there were none, you ought to show it on the Defendants part.
Therefore let the Plaintiff have his Judgment.

Elsy against Mawdit.
Trin. 1650. Banc. sup.
Pasc. 1650. rot. 409.
THe Case of Elsy and Maw dit was again moved, Arrest of judgment in an action

wherein the Plaintiff had a verdict against the Defendant, in an Action upon
the Case brought against him, for speaking these words of him; Thou Sirrah art
a rogue, and a runaway rogue, and did run away at Oxford, and art a rogue
upon Record at Oxford; upon a motion in arrest of Judgment; Judgment was
stayed till the Plaintiff should move. Hales now moved for Judgment, because
the words are actionable, for they make the Plaintiff to be such a Rogue as may
be endicted within the Statute, and receive corporal punishment; But Twisden
denied it. Roll chief Justice held it was within the Statute. Yet the Court
would advise. In this case Ierman Justice said, That if one say that another is
forsworn in a Court of Record, the words are not actionable; but if he say that
he is forsworn upon Record, the words are actionable. But Roll chief Iustce
held there was no difference between the words, but that they are both
Actionable. Antea et Postea.

More against the Earl Rivers.
Trin. 1650. Banc. sup.
Mich. 1649, rot. 588.
MOre Arrested the Earl Rivers by a bill of Midlesex in a plea of Debt. The
Earl was thereupon brought before Mr. Justice Nicholas to put in bail, Earl
Rivers case touching privilege of pecrage.
and not being able to put in sufficient bail according to the course of the
Court, was committed to the custody of the Marshall of the Marshalsea, the
Earl being in custody brings himself into Court by a habeas corpus, and there
pleads his privilege of his peerage, and says, that he ought not to be
arrested, and demands Judgment of the Writ, and prays to be delivered; to
this the Plaintiff demurred. Hales of Council with the Earl argued to diverse
points, but I could not here him well. But the main question he insisted upon
was, whether that by taking away the house of Lords in Parliament, whereby
their voice and place in Parliament was gone, the Privilege of his peerage not
to be arrested for Debt, was also taken away, and he argued that it was not,
for he said, that at the Common Law, no capias did lie against a Peer, Capias.
and the Statute of E. 3. which gave a capias for Debt against others, did not
give it against a Peer, and it does appear here that the Defendant is really an
Earl, and not in nomination only, and he cited 27 H. 8. f. 22. b The reasons he
said why an Earl had the privilege not to be arrested, are two. The first is in
respect of the dignity of his person, being called comes a comitando rege (as
some have thought,) and he is called by the King consanguineus noster. The
second is in respect of the presumption of his sufficiency of estate in lands
to be summoned by, and not by reason of his place in Parliament, for they have
the privilege not to be arrested, as well in the vacancy of Parliaments, as
when the Parliament does sit, and the privilege of Parliament is that he shall
not be sued; but the privilege of peerage is, that he shall not be arrested in
his person, and so they are distinct privileges, and by taking away the Lords
house, the former privilege is taken away, but not the latter, and this
privilege (annexed to the person) not to be arrested, may belong to a person
that has not the privilege of Parliament, as for example unto Widows of Peers
which could not be arrested, and yet had no place in Parliament, so that the
excluding them from the Parliament does only take away their privilege of
Parliament, and not their privilege of peerage, and Nevlils case is, that the
privilege not to be arrested belongs to them in respect of the dignity of their
persons, 9 Rep. Salops case. And it has been a question whether comes be so
called a comitando rege, or in respect of their Counties whereof they were
Earls, and I conceive the latter derivation is the truer, and then the taking
away the King takes not away their privilege, for the Counties remain. 2ly.
Earls have by intendment sufficient freehold to enfcore them to come in, and
answer at this day, and therefore are not to be arrested, and imprisonment of a
man's person for debt, was but a suppliment to make him answer where he had not
sufficient freehold, which we cannot intend here, Not. brev. f. 93. And an Earl
shall be amerced higher than another man, in regard of the presumption of his
freehold, and Earls are called majores Barons in this respect, 7 E. 4 Nevils
case, and the widow of an Earl had the privilege not to be arrested, for the
two very reasons that her husband had it, so was it of a Bishop, Abbot, and
Prior of England; but otherwise it was of a Bishop that had a Bishopric out of
England. And the late Statute that takes away the Kingly office, does not take
away their names, and dignities, nor the presumption that they have freeholds,
and therefore they are not to be arrested, and their will be since the Act, no
more a failer of right than there was before, and so he prayed the Writ might
be abated. Abatement.
Roll chief Justice answered, your Clyent ought to have prayed the Writ might
have abated, before he was turned over to the Marshall of this Court^, for then
he was in Midlesex where he was arrested; but now it is too late, for now he is
in custodia Marescalli, Declaration.
and any body that has cause of Action against him may declare against him.
Ierman Justice said, that the Writ is now determined, which you pray to have
abated, so your prayer is to no purpose. Roll chief Justice said, that the
dignity of the person of an Earl may relate to him as he is Peer of the
Parliament, and the other presumption that he has sufficient freehold may also
fail; but it does not appear here by averment that he has not freehold,
therefore it may be a question whether there shall be intended a sailer of
Justice, for want of freehold, if the party should not have been arrested, and
he agreed that an Earl as a Peer of Parliament had a double privilege, one of
his person to be free from arrests, Arrests.
the other of his Estate to be free from suits, and he said, if it had appeared
by averment that the party had freehold, it had been good without doubt to free
him from arrests. Ierman Justice said he is now in custodia, and the
Declaration against him is good, and now it is too late to claim his privilege.
Nicholas in all points was against the privilege. Roll chief Justice asked,
what say you to them that have Declarations on the by against the Earl,
Declaration.
for certainly they are good whether he be rightly committed or not, for they
are not to examine his commitment, and therefore surely it is now too late to
speak in abatement of the Writ.

Nayler against Ash.
Trin. 1050. Banc. sup.
Hill. 23 Car. rot. 611.
NAyler brought an Action upon the Statute of 5 Eliz. against Ash in this Court
for using the Trade of a Draper, Arrest of judgment in ^n action upon the
Statute of 5 El. or using the ^ade of a Draper.
and upon not guilty pleaded there was an issue joined, and a verdict found for
the Plaintiff. The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, and took two
exceptions to the Plaintiffs Declaration. 1. That the Statute does not name the
trade. 2. That it being a popular Action, it ought to have been brought in the
County where the offense was committed, and not in this Court. To the 1.
Exception the Council on the Plaintiffs side answered, that the trade is
comprised in the meaning of the Statute, because it was a trade used at the
time of the making of the Statute. And to the second he answered, that
notwithstanding that the original process issued out of this Court, yet the
trial thereupon was in the County where the offense was done, and the remedy
that the Statute intends, is made use of by the trial being in the County where
the offense was done. Roll chief Justice answered, we directed you to search
for presidents, but you have not done it. But I conceive the Statute is not
satisfied, for it says that the party shall not be compelled to appear out of
the County, and here he is compelled, Appearance.
and this is not helped by the verdict, to which the Court agreed.

Ernely against Allen.
Trin. 1650. Banc. sup.
Mich. 1649. rot. 351.
ERnely brought an Action of Trover and conversion against Allen, Error to
reverse a judgment in a Trover and Conversion.
for taking away, and converting to his own use diverse of his goods, and
Chattels, and amongst others he declares for the Trover and Conversion de
ducentis ponderibus, anglice weight, medicamenti, anglice drugs; the Plaintiff
had a verdict, and a Judgment, and entire damages given for all the things
laid in the Declaration. The Defendant brought a Writ of error to reverse this
Judgment, and assigns for Error, that the words de ducentis ponderibus,
anglice weight, medicamenti, anglice drugs, mentioned in the Declaration are
uncertain, and so the damages being given entire for all, it was not good.
Wadham Windham of Council with the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error, held the
words to be uncertain, both in respect of quantity, as also in respect of the
quality or nature of the drugs, for the word pondus may signify a pound, an
ounce, a dram, a scruple, or any other weight, so that the weight cannot be
known. And the anglice weight is as uncertain as the Latin word pound, for
weight may signify as many different waights as the Latin word pondus may; But
it might have been otherwise, if it had been anglice a stone, or a weigh, which
were words certainly known what they mean; but here a weight of drugs is not
understood by the Drugsters. And for the words they shall not be said to be
void, so that there are no damages given for them, for the words are not like
to the words duodecem duodena fili, for they are adjective words; but the words
here are substantive, and signify by themselves. And the word medicamentum
also is as uncertain as the other words, and the anglice drugs does not make it
more certain, for a drug is of as an uncertain signification as the word
medicamentum, for all vegetable creatures, and extractions out of them, as also
out of the living creatures, made use of in physic, either by themselves, or
else compounded one with another, are called drugs, and so he prayed the
Judgment might be reversed. Maynard on the other side said, that the words
joined with the anglice were certain enough, for pondus signifies a weight,
which word is well and commonly known amongst the Drugsters how much it
contains, and he cited one Pennyes Case, where december ponderibus without an
anglice was held good; and one Wardners Case 21 Iac. in this Court. Next for
the word medicamentum being joined with an anglice, it is a good word to
express drugs, for of it self it is no Latin word to signify any certain
thing, and here is no incertainty in the matter, for if I may be brought to a
certainty to the Iuries understanding, and it is not necessary to express the
matter like a Scholar, or a Philosopher, but only as they are known by
tradesmen according to common understanding. And in an Action brought amongst
other things, for a Library of Books, which is more uncertain, Judgment was
given for the Plaintiff, and Melbuis Case, where the Declaration inter alia was
pro december ponderibus ferri, ten tuns of Iron, was agreed between the parties,
and Laurence and Turners Case, Mich. 23. Iac. in Trover and Conversion, pro
tribus ponderibus lani, was naught, because it was without an anglice. Sergeant
Glin argued to the same effect on the same side. Hales on the otherside said,
that notwithstanding the anglice the Declaration was uncertain. And it is not
like the cases de tribus ponderibus, Anglice, weights of Cheese, or Salt, or
stone weight of Cheese. And the word medicamentum is as uncertain as the other
word, for it signifies diverse species of things. But Roll chief Justice held,
that the Drugs were well expressed by the words in the Declaration in the
vulgar and usual acceptance of the words; Declaration.
and for the word weight it is also well known amongst Tradesmen. Nicholas
Justice said, we must not frame niceties to overthrow judgments, and here is
certainty enough in both the words to describe the thing, and it is impossible
to express them aptly and particularly. Roll chief Justice said, the
Declaration is two hundred weight, and every one knows the meaning of a
Hundred. Ierman Justice held the Declaration certain enough, and cited a case
where one declared pro december doliis spirituum, Anglice, ten Hogsheads of
Spirits, and adjudged good. Ask of the same opinion, and so the judgment was
affirmed, nisi.

Dudeny against Collyer.
Trin. 1650. Banc. sup.
Hill. 23 Car. rot. 156.
DUdeny brought a writ of Error against Collyer to reverse a judgment upon a
nibil dicit given against him at the Court of Barnestable in an Action of debt
brought upon an Obligation, and assigns for Error, Error to reverse a judgment
upon a Nihil dicit in debt upon an Obligation.
that the Condition of the Bond was for the payment of money at Wotton
Courtney, which is not within the Jurisdiction of the Court, and so they cannot
hold plea for it at Barnestable, and the judgment was given upon a nihil
dicit, because the Plea being foreign the Defendant would not swear it, which in
this case he is not bound to do. Roll chief Justice, If it appear by the
Declaration that the money was to be paid out of the jurisdiction of the Court,
jurisdiction.
the Judgment is not good, and it is not necessary to swear the Plea, if it
appears upon the Obligation that the moneys were to be paid out of the
jurisdiction of the Court, Plea
and he plead payment according to the Condition; Judgment.
but if one will not swear a foreign Plea where he ought to do it, the Plaintiff
may enter judgment upon a nihil dicit; for such a foreign Plea not sworn, is no
Plea upon the matter. The Judgment was reversed nisi, etc.

and Assigns for Error that the Obligor in the Obligation upon which the Action
was brought made his wife his Executrix, and dyed, and that the wife being
Executrix dyed intestate; and that the Plaintiff in the Action took
administration of the goods and Chattels of the feme, and brought the action of
Debt upon an Obligation, as Administrator to the wife; whereas the Plaintiff
ought first to have taken Letters of Administration de bonis non administratis

To which the Court agreed; and said it is a plain fault, and reversed the
Judgment nisi, etc.

Elsy against Mawdit.

ELsy brought an action of Assault and Battery against Mawdit an Attorney of
this Court, Whether the Hu^band must put in bail for his wife in assault and
battery.
and his wife. The Defendant Mawdit appeared in propria persona, and his wife
was in custodia, and so the Plaintiff declared against them; the question here
was whether Mawdit the Defendant ought not to put in bail for his wife. Burrel
of Council with the Defendant argued, that the Declaration was not good,
because that the Husband Mawdit ought to have put in bail for his Wife, and
cited Smith and Smiths case, and Mich. 17 Car. Simon Fanshaws case, and Dyer
377 a. and Brook title Privilege, 353 a. and 9 rep. Roll chief Justice said, he
ought to put in bail; therefore the Plaintiff nil capiat per billam, Bail.

Trin. 1650. Banc. sup.
LAtch shows for cause why a procedendo should not be granted to London against
De roy, Cause why a a procedendo should not be granted to London.
who upon a trial against him was committed in London for using the Trade of a
working Goldsmiths, and a working Ieweller, not having served as an Apprentise
to the Trade, and was brought hither by a Habeas Corpus. 1. That the
Declaration is founded upon a By-law, and that By-law is founded upon a Custom,
and if either the Custom or By-law be not good in all patts, the Declaration is
naught; and here the Custom is certified in the negative, and this is oppositum
in subjecto, and merely contradictory in it self, By-law.
8 E. 3. 77. and the By-law also that is certified is not certain, and it is
also unreasonable, for every stroke the Defendant strikes, is using of his
Trade, and it is unreasonable he should pay five pound for every stroke. 2ly.
The Declaration is not applied to the By-law upon which it is grounded, for the
doing of a thing one day is not using to do it, and the words diversis vicibus
do not help it, for they are not applied to his working as a Ieweller but to
his working as a Goldsmith only; also it does not appear who is to have the
forfeiture for one third part of the fine set upon him; and it is not said that
he gained his living by the Trade or sale of the commodity wrought, and the
words of using it pro lucro et proficuo do not help it, for it may be he uses
it for his private use, and that is to his profit, though he sell not the
commodity. Next it is unreasonable that a stranger an Alfen shall be restrained
by a By-law made 40 years ago, Notice.
where of he had no notice, and that by reason of such a Law he should be
punished for doing a thing which the Common Law allows, namely to get his own
living. It is also said, Non existens liber homo usus est art, etc. which are
words very uncertain; for by the offense so expressed every Apprentice may be
punished for working, for an Apprentice is not Liber homo. Maynard on the other
side cited 5 E. 3. that a negative with an affirmative employed is good, and
that it is exclusive of Strangers, and inclusive of the Citizens. And the
offense is the matter, and not the time of the Defendants using the Trade, and
it is also well designed in all points to what use the fine is to be put; and
if there be Error they ought to bring a writ of Error, and to except to the
Declaration; And this case cannot be likened to an Apprentises working, for he
uses the Trade not for himself but his Masters benefit. The Court desired
books, and adjourned it till the next Term.

the condition was for the payment of a certain sum of money upon the

Error to reverse a judgment in an Action on the Case.

Plaintiff does not say Cujus maritagium ad ipsum pertiner. But Roll chief
Justice said, that it could not be otherwise intended, but that the marriage
belongs to him, and it does not appear that his Son was married before, and the
value of the marriage is not here material; for the marriage of his Son belongs
unto him as a parent, Marriage.
in regard of his protection and advice. Ierman differed, and said, that if he
were married before, he was then Pater Familias, and is out of the protection of
his Father. Protection
But Nicholas and Ask Justices agreed with Roll, and Roll said, the matter here
is not the loss of the marriage, for that is but to increase the damages, but
the Action lies only, quare cepit et abduxit. Adjourned to be argued the next
Term. Antea et Postea.

of what Commission it was taken. Roll chief Justice, He ought to show by virtue
of what Commission particularly it was taken, and therefore let it be quashed,

granted to the Prerogative Court, Why a Prohibition should not be granted to
the Prerogative.
That in the will which the Prerogative Court endeavored to repeal, there were
lands given to the Executor. The Court answered. If the Prerogative have power
to prove a will, they may also repeal it by appeal; but if lands be devised,
together with goods, they have no power to repeal it as to the lands, but if
they should have no power to repeal it as to the goods it would be mischievous.
But they have no authority to make the devise good or ill, as to the lands.
Prohibition.
And the Court was at first agreed to grant a Prohibition as to the lands only.
But afterward the Court held that there could be no such division made of the
will by Prohibition, as to stand good in part, and to be repealed for the rest,
and so would not grant the prohibition. Nota.

undetermined, and that the party had moved for execution in the Common Pleas;
but the Clarks refuse to make out execution, without the rule of this Court,

Procedendo to London.
for speaking these words, Thou art a Whore, and my Husbands Whore, and he does
maintain thee. The Defendant removed the cause into this Court by a Habeas
Corpus, whereupon the Plaintiff moved for a procedendo. Roll chief Justice was
of opinion that a procedendo ought to be granted; for if it should not, the
party has no remedy to proceed; and if they do proceed in London, and the
judgment he thereupon erroneous, the party grieved may bring a writ of Error
in the Hustinges, and reverse it. Ierman Justice said, here is a wrong done,
and the remedy is given according to the custom of the City, and it is a good
custom, Custom.
because it is for the preservation of the Peace of the City, and it is the
custom of the City to whip a Whoremonger, and to Cart a Whore; and this may be
the ground or reason why an action lies in London for calling of a woman whore
there, thought it do not lie in other places.

was moved that the Judgment might not be entered, Judgment.
because it should have been entered before Execution issued forth, and
therefore it was suggested that now it was too late, and prayed to supersede
the Execution, Supersedeas.
because there was no judgment to warrant it. But Roll the Chief Justice
answered, that this being but a neglect of the Clark, judgment might be well
enough entered, though the Execution were issued forth, and because the trial
between the parties is right, therefore let it be entered.

Plaintifs Declaration; That it did not appear by it in what Parish the lands
lie, out of which the tithes grew due. On the other side it was said, (...)
appeared well enough by implication; but if it did not, it is not now material,
there being a verdict in the case by which it is helped. Ierman Justice said,
there is only an implication to show in what Parish the lands lie, and that is
not a violent implication neither, and therefore the Declaration cannot be
good. But Roll Chief Justice answered, What if the Plaintiff had only said, that
the tithes belonged unto him? And it is here after a verdict, and the
Declaration is helped by it; Declaration.
but if you had demurred to the Declaration, it would have been ruled to be
naught. Demurrer.
And if the tithes do belong to the Plaintiff, why may it not be employed that

thence till such a time, and shows precisely when, and that within six years
after his return he brought this action Upon this Replication, The Defendant
demurred, and upon the Demurrer Judgment was given for the Plaintiff. The
Defendant brought a writ of Error to reverse this Judgment, and assigned for
Error, 1. That the replication of the Plaintiff, upon which the Demurrer was
joined, is double; For first he allegeth that he is a Merchant, and so is a
person out of the Statute of limitations: And secondly he shows that he brought
his Action within 6 years after his return, which is needless. 2ly. He says,
That he did not return into England, whereas the Statute is general, If he
return, and he may return into Wales. But to that the Court answered, that to
return into England, or into Wales, was all one as to the intent of the
Statute. 3ly. The Action was an Action upon the Case, and that Action is not
mentioned in the Statute. But Roll chief Justice said, this is no new Case; for
it has been ruled that an Action upon the Case is within the Statute. Case.

but because another exception was taken, That the Plaintiff does not aver that
he was a Practiser at the time of the bringing of his Action; Averment.
and because it was also objected that the Plaintiff was now sequestered,
Therefore the rule was, that the Record or the Postea should be brought into

he may be a Barrester and not practice. But the Court would advise.

Judgment in an Action upon the Statute of 12 E. ^. of Hue and Cries. Recital.
the question being, whether the Plaintiff in his Declaration had mis-recited
the Statute or not, Roll chief Justice took this difference, that if one bring
an Action upon a Statute, and in his Declaration mis-recite it, in words which
go to the ground of the Action, though there be a Verdict in the case, yet it
is not helped; but if the mis-recital be in words which do not go to the
ground of the Action, it is helped after Verdict by the Statute of Ieofails.

Turnips in the ground, Case.
and so part of the Freehold. But Roll chief Justice held, the words are
actionable, for the Turnips shall be intended to be pulled up, and the Grass

cause why the Plaintiff shall not have his Judgment.

Judgment in Trespass quare clausum fregit.

suos ibidem nuper inventos cepit et asportavit. The Plaintiff has a Verdict and
a judgment, the Defendant brings a writ of Error to reverse the judgment, and
assigns for Error, 1. That the Trespass was done in the late Kings time, and
therefore the Declaration should have been contra pacem Domini Regis, and not
publicam. 2ly. That the Declaration is uncertain; for it appears not whether
the Posts and Pales were fixed to the ground or no, nor how many of them there
were, and so the nature of the offense cannot be certainly known. But the Court
held that the first exception was but a mistake of the Clark, and so may be
amended, and as it is there is no repugnancy in it. And as to the second, the
Court held that it shall be intended that the Posts and Pales were not fixed to
the ground; Amendment.
and there is no necessity to express how many Posts and how many Pales the
Defendant took, Intendment.
and it is not material whether they were fixed or not. But the Court would
advise, and ordered Council to spoke again to it.

which was made in the life of the Intestate only. 2ly. That there is no Capias

first to read it your self in French, which he accordingly did, and afterward
Woodward read it in Latin. Twisden of Council on the otherside said, that the
challenge was taken to no purpose, for the Jury was returned by the Secondary
by rule of Court, and the Hundreders were put out by the consent of the
parties; But the Court answered, that the consent of the parties was to no
purpose to avoid the challenge, but that it was a good challenge, Consent,
Challenge. Tales.
and there cannot be a tales granted upon a challenge for default of
Hundreders, and therefore the panel was quashed, and a new Jury ordered to be

Upon which it was read by Woodward Clark of the Court. After which Roll chief

Burton against Low.
Mich. 1650. Banc. sup.
BUrton brought an Action of debt against Low, Demurrer in debt upon a Sheriffs
bond.
upon a Sheriffs bond given by Low to the Sheriff, being arrested by him by
virtue of an Attatchment directed to him out of the Chancery, the condition of
the Bond was, that the Defendant should appear on such a day in Cancellaria
apud Westmonasterium ubicunque suerit. The Defendant pleads in Bar the Statute
of 3 H. 6. she Plaintiff demurred to this plea. Moseley of Council with the
Defendant argued that the Bond upon which the Action was brought was void, and
against the Statute. 1. Because the party is bound to appear in a Court, which
is not a fixed Court, and so uncertain, namely the Court of Chancery at
Westminster, whereas the Chancery is a moveable Court, and not fixed to
Westminster or any other place. 2ly. The condition of the Obligation is
impossible, for it is that the Defendant shall appear in the Chancery at
Westminster wheresoever it shall be, and it is impossible for him to appear at
Westminster, and at another place at the same time. 3ly. The Bond varies from
the Statute in some things, and enjoins more than the Statute requires in other
things. VVilmot on the other side held that the Bond is not within the Statute,
because the King is not within the Statute, as was held 13 Car. and. 7 H. 4. f.
44. 5 rep. VVhelpdales case, Dyer 119. Roll chief Justice held; that a Bond
given to appear upon an Attatchment out of the Chancery is within the Statute;
but it has been heretofore a question whether a Sergeant at Arms of Wales were
within the Statute; but it has been since ruled that he is not, and here is a
material variance in the Bond, which makes it void, and neither the upper Bench
nor the Chancery are fixed Courts, Obligation.
and therefore the Defendant ought not to be bound precisely to appear at
Westminster, and then to add ubicumque fuerit is a material variance,
Chancery. Variance.
and makes the Bond naught. Ierman Justice to the same effect, and said, that
the Chancery may sit at any time out of the Term when they please, and their
not sitting in the Vacations, is for the ease and convenience of the people.
Nil capiat per billamn si, etc. Antea.

carry him away, for I lay flat Felony to him, and for speaking these words to
the Plaintiff himself, I will make you hold up you hand at the Bar: upon not
guilty pleaded an issue was joined, and a verdict found for the Plaintiff. It
was moved in arrest of Judgment that the words are not actionable; but the
Court held them clearly actionable, and ruled the Plaintiff to take his
Judgment, except other cause were showed to the contrary Friday following.

Popham against White.
Mich. 1650. Banc. sup.
Upon a verdict found for the Plaintiff in a Trover and Conversion, Arrest of
judgment in a Trover and Conversion.
the Defendant in Arrest of Judgment took exception to the Declaration because
the Plaintiff had declared of a Trover and Conversion de december arboribus,
whereas the trees were Timber trees that were felled, and so they are not well
expressed, for the word arbor properly signifies a tree that grows, and not one
cut down, according to the old verse, Arbor dum crescit lignum dum crescere
nescit, and so a Trover cannot be brought pro arbore. But Roll chief Justice
said, that they were well enough expressed by the Declaration, Declaration.

and that they ought not to be too strict in scanning some words where the
thing is well described.

whereupon the Prisoner pleaded he had a pardon, and produced it, and it was
read openly, the Prisoner kneeling on his keees in the mean time; after reading
of it, he was asked what it was he demanded besides of the Court? he answered,
that he prayed his pardon might be allowed, which, after Ierman Justice had
made a grave speech to exhort him to a better carriage for the future, was done
accordingly.

in arrest of Judgment Green took these exceptions to the Declaration. 1. That
it is too short, because that after the words quare filium suum and heredem
rapuit and maritavit, there ought to have been added cujus maritagium ad ipsum

Son and Heir, although he be not within age; but if it be another Son it is not

and in regard that the damages given by the Jury were excessive, the Court
deferred to give Judgment that time, and persuaded the Plaintiffs council to
go to a new new try all. Antea et Postea.

whom the Letters of Administration were granted unto him, as he ought to do,
according to the books of 26 H. 6.29. and 35 H. 6. The Court answered that he

Feme, and they also declare that the Defendant alia enormia eis intulit, which

Justice agreed.

Fairefax against Fairfax.
Mich. 1650. Banc. sup.
IN a writ of Error brought to reverse a Judgment given in a writ of Dowr
these exceptions were taken; Error to reverse a judgment in down.
1. That the original was not well returned, for their appears not to be any
return of the Proclamation of the summons, and though the party do appear, yet
it was said that it is not helped thereby. 2ly. The demand is uncertain, for
the demand is de tertia part decimarum garbarum in Colton, and by this demand
the Kind of the Tithes demanded is not made certain, for the word garba admits
of diverse constructions, and so Lynwood the Civilian shows. 3ly. It is not
expressed whether the Defendant be terr-Tenant, or heir. 4ly. The demand is ac
etiam de rectoria de Acerstall Malvis, which is uncertain, for it ought to be
de rectoria ecclesiae. Roll chief Justice to the 1. Exception said,
Miscontinuance.
that the appearance of the party will help miscontinuance of process, and so it
does here. Hales to the 2d. exception said, that decimae garbarum is certain
enough to common understanding. To the 3d. Exception he held it not necessary
to say de rectoria ecclesiae, for it must be so necessarily intended. The Court
desired to see books, and so it was adjourned. At another day the case was
again moved, and these spoken to and answered, 1. As before that decimae
garbarum is certain enough so common intendment. 2ly. That it is not necessary
to express the setting forth of the dowr in the tithes by metes and bounds,
for tithes cannot be so set forth, and it is not constant to use the expression
per metas et bundas. Latch took another exception that it was improperly
expressed, for one to enter into an Advowson. And to the exception formerly
taken, he held that the Proclamation of summons ought to have been returned,
and that fault is not helped by the late Act, because it is matter of
substance, and not mere matter of form, and he said that appearance of the
party does salve a discontinuance of mean processes; but not of original
process as this is, which is the very foundation of the Action, and that
though the want of a summons be helped by the parties appearance; yet the want
of returning the summons is not helped by the parties appearance. Next he held,
as formerly, that decimae garbarum is uncertain, and that the nature of the
corn ought to be showed. Roll chief Justice said, Return.
that the not returning the proclamation of summons is not material, for the
summons is only to make the party appear, and he has appeared in this case,
and the late Act extends to it if it were not good without it. And the demand
of tertiam partem garbarum is certain enough by common intendment, but it seems
more certain here than so, for it is tertiam partem garbarum granorum which
signifies corn; And it is not necessary to express the setting forth of the
dowr per metas et bundas, but it is well as it is without that expression. And
lastly, It is well enough said, ingressus est into the advowson, although it be
not so proper an expression as might have been used, for it is good enough to
make the party tenant. Ierman Justice to the same effect, and said, that if
there be two Tenants in Common, and one of them dye, it is a great question how
the wife shall be endowed, viz. whether per metas and bundas or no. And he
doubted whether the Writ of error here brought were good or not, for it is
retornable coram custodibu^ libertatis, etc. apud Westmonasterium, whereas as
it ought to be coram custodibus ubicunque, for they are not fixed to
Westminster. Nicholas Justice to the same effect. Error.
Roll chief Justice said it was a good exception that Ierman took to the Writ
of error But the Court was here at Westminster at the return of the Writ, and
the Writ was made by the Custodes themselves, and the parties did appear upon
it, and therefore he questioned whether it might not be made good for these
reasons. Ierman Justice held it could not. Roll chief Justice said that all the
Latin presidents are agreeable to this Writ, and it would be dangerous to alter
them; But let the cursitors attend, Presidents.
and give their reasons why they do not alter this form, and if the Writ be
good, me thinks the Judgment should be affirmed. Yet we will advise a little
of the writ, and whether the demand of decimam partem garbarum, without
granorum, be good or not Postea.

It was said by Roll chief Justice, That if the writ of habere facias
possessionem do contein more Acres of Land than are expressed in the
Declaration, that it is error. But if the Sheriff do give possession of more
Land than is contained in the writ of habere facias possessionem, an Action of
the case lies against the Sheriff, or an Assise lies for the land. It was also
said, that if a Judgment be affirmed upon a writ of error in the Exchequer
Chamber, Error. Case. Assise. Execution.
yet they cannot grant out execution there; but it must be in this Court.

would make no rule, for the Defendant may give rules in the office to force him

Fairefax against Fairefax.
Mich. 1630. Banc. sup.
THe Case between Fairefax and Fairefax was moved again, Whether a demand in
down good or not.
and Hales held that the demand of dowr de decimis garbarum was certain enough,
though it be not garbarum granorum, and he cited the Register 46. and Dyer, f.
84. and one Cavendishes case, 8. Iac. Roll chief Justice took a difference
between a demand of Tithes, and the suing for a recompense for Tithes, upon the
Statute of 2 Ed. 6. and cited the Regist. 165 and he held the demand here to be
good, with whom concurred the other Judges. Ask Justice said, that a garb is a
french word, and signifies any thing bound up into a bundle; but by Cowell the
Civilian it signifies Corn bound up, and so is the word commonly used at the
Common Law. Demand.
Roll chief Justice said, that a demand in a praecipe ought to be more certain,
than it is necessary for a demand in dowr to be. Latch said that the words
coram nobis apud VVestmonasterium is part of the style of the Court, which Roll
chief Justice denied, yet he said it was well enough, because the Court was
there at the return of the writ of Error. To which the other Judges agreed, and
the rule was that the Judgment should be affirmed nisi, etc. antea.

Mich. 1650. Banc. sup.
THe Court was moved that one was arrested upon a day of thanksgiving
appointed by the Parliament, Moved to discharge an arrest
and that he was forced to put in bond to the Sheriff for his appearance, and
therefore it was prayed that the party arrested might be discharged, and that
the bond given to the Sherif might be delivered up. Roll the chief Justice
answered, Endict the Bailies that made the Arrest, or bring your Action against
them if you please, Discharge.
for we will not discharge the party arrested.

Bois against Cranfield.

rot. Q.
BOis as Executor to another brought an Action of Debt upon diverse Obligations

The Defendant pleaded that he did pay a lesser sum than is expressed in the
Obligations to the Testator during his life, and that he did accept there of in
full satisfaction of the said Obligations. To this plea the Plaintiff demurred.
Roll Chief Justice upon opening the matter said, that the question here is,
whether the payment, or the acceptance of the money paid in satisfaction be to
be traversed. And he held it was indifferent to traverse either of them;
Traverse.
but he said it was more proper to join issue upon the payment, but the Court
would advise. It was then also said, that if one pay money in satisfaction of
an Obligation, and the party to whom it is paid says that he will receive it
for another cause, Satisfaction, payment.
yet if he receive it it shall be judged to be paid in satisfaction of the
Obligation; for he must receive it upon such terms as the other will pay it.

Beal against VVyman.
Mich. 1650. Banc. sup.
Trin. 1649. rot. 849.
Upon these words of a will, Question upon words of a Will.
viz. I give and bequeath one half of my lands to my wife, and after her death
I give all my lands to the heirs males of any of my Sons, or next of Kin, Latch
made these questions in the Case, 1. Whether there were a good estate created
by these words of the will. 2ly. Whether the estate were destroyed by the fine
levied of the lands. For the 1. he held, that the heirs males of any of his
Sons, are words certain enough to create an estate; for it is all one as if he
had said to the heirs males of all his sons, if they have heirs males, or to
those who have heirs males, and the words, or to the next of Kin, are also
certain enough, being joined with the precedent words, and shall be meant to
the next of Kin, and their heirs males, if his sons have no heirs males; For in
a Win if there be words to express the meaning of the Testator it is sufficient
enough, though the words be not apt. And he cited 21 Rich. 2. Devise 27. and 8
Rep. 46, and said, that the case in 30 Ass. pl. 47. is the same with this in
terminis. And here is no contingent remainder, but only a contingent devise,
and there is no necessity for a particular estate to support it; for it arises
out of the estate of the Devisor; yet if there were need of a particular estate
here to support the remainder, here is a particular estate in the wife, who by
implication of the will does take all the land during her life, as it is 13 H.
7.29 H. 8. Br. Devise 48. Trin. 3 Ed. 6. Bendloes. Plow. Com. 521. Whelpdales
case, Pasch. 25 Eliz Com. Ban. To the 2 point he spoke not, holding it not
material. Hales of Council on the other side held, that the wife had not an
estate for life in all the land by implication of the will, but only an estate
for life in a moiety of the land, and so there is no particular estate to
support the contingent remainder, which he held was in this case; and that it
is not a contingent Devise as Latch urged; for the remainder here depends by
way of remainder, and not as a contingent Devise. And he held the Devise it
self to be void, admitting all the precedent matter alleged to be true. 1.
Because the devise is uncertain; for the intent of the deviser does not appear;
for it appears not what heir male shall have the land, whether the heir male of
his son, or the heir male of his next of Kin; for the words are disjunctive; 41
and 42 Eliz. Com. Banc. in the Case of Tailor and Sawyer land devised to a Man's
Issue was adjudged a void devise for the incertainty of it. And he held that
the intent was that the heir male of his son should inherit before the heir
male of the next of Kin, otherwise the further off of Kin should have the land
before the nearer of Kin. And he said that Hill. 2. Car. Rot. 1288. Com. Banc.
in Hunt and Fishers case, the case at the Bar was adjudged in point. Roll chief
Justice said, That the intention of the Testator here is coeca and sicca,
Intention.
and senceless, and cannot be known, Will.
and we ought not to frame a sense upon the words of a Will, where we cannot
find out the Testators meaning. Ierman Justice held, that the devise was not
void, but that the words are to be interpreted as they may stand with Law, and
as the words will bear. Nicholas Justice prima facie that the devise is void,
but yet it is questionable. Ask Justice to the same intent. Roll chief Justice
said, that there is too much way usually given to ambiguous devises. But let it
be argued again the next Term.

Parker against Cook.
Mich. 1650. Banc. sup.
Hill. 23 Car. rot. 660.
THe Action was an Action of Trespass quare Clausum fregit: Upon a Demurrer the
question was, whether a Copyhold were forfeited or not.
The Defendant pleaded a special plea of justification, viz. That the Plaintiff
was a Copyholder to his Manor, and that for refusing to appear and do his
service at his Court he had forfeited his Copyhold, and that therefore he did
enter. The Case was this, The Defendant being Lord of the Manor, and holding of
his Court, the Plaintiff being Tenant, and being in the Court, and there being a
question whether the Court were legally then held or no, and being asked if he
did appear or not, he answered, If it be a legal Court, I do appear, but if it
be not a legal Court, I do not appear. The question was, whether this be an
appearance, or such a refusal to appear whereby the Copyholder shall forfeit
his Copyhold, or not. Latch held it was no appearance, and that therefore the
Copyhold was forfeited, and cited 43 Ed. 3. f. 25. And he said, though it be
not expressed by the Defendant, that the Plaintiff was legally summoned to
appear in Court, it is not material, seeing he was present in Court, and did
refuse, being demanded, to appear. And that this was a sufficient contempt to
make a forfeiture. And he said that the Rejoinder is ill; for it is dixit
comparuit, and he does not answer to the fact alleged, viz. That he denied to
do his suit and service. Wild on the other side said, that it is no forfeiture;
for if the Court be well held, then he does appear, as his words do plainly
manifest, and so there is no contempt; and if the Court were not well held, his
not appearing shall not burt him, for he is not required to do it. 37 Eliz. Est
and Hardinges case, and 4 rep. 27. Hobard and Hamonds case: And besides, this
cannot be a voluntary contempt, because he did appear conditionally, and did
not absolutely refuse. And the Replication has not entitled you to a
forfeiture. Besides it appears not here that the Court was legally summoned, as
it ought to do, nor that there was any proclamation made for the holding of the
Court, nor any notice given to the Tenants of the holding of the Court, 38, 39
Eliz. Banc. Reg. Crisp and Dyer. Roll chief Justice, This case has depended
long. Forfeiture.
It is a hard thing to make a forfeiture of the Copyhold, if there was a real
controversy whether the Court was well held or not; but if not, and that the
words were used only as a shift to avoid the Plaintifs suit and service, it is
a forfeiture; for the words are like Jack in a Box, and no body knows what to
make of them. Ierman, Nicholas, and Ask inclined that it was no forfeiture.
Adjourned to the next term.

Fielder against Tovy.
Hill. 1650. Banc. sup.
Pasch. 1650. rot. 430.
FIelder brought an action of debt upon a bond given to the Sherif by Tovy the
Defendant, to appear to the Plaintiff in the Upper Bench, Demurrer to a
Declaration upon a Sherifs Bond.
to an Action there brought against the Defendant, The Defendant appears, and
demurs to the Declaration, and shows for cause, that the Bond upon which the
Plaintiff declares, and the Declaration do not agree, for the Plaintiff declares
pro quadragint. libris, and the Obligation mentions, that the Defendant is
bound in quadragent. libris. Diverse cases were put to resemble this, viz.
Massam and Iollies case, where sexigint was put for sexagint. and yet held
good, and Waters case, where septuagint. was put for septingent. And Downs and
Hussies case, 12 Car. Banc. Reg. where quingint. duabus libris was used instead
of quinquagint. and yet held good, because it might be an abreviation of
quinquagint. Ierman Justice held the Declaration not good, because the
condition of the Obligation is to do a collateral thing, and so it cannot
appear by it what the sum is in which the party is bound, as it may where the
condition is for the payment of money. Roll chief Justice held the Declaration
not good, Declaration.
because the Bond upon which it is grounded does not warrant it, and the
meaning of the word cannot here be known, and if the Condition were not
collateral it would not help it. Nicholas Justice differed, and said, it would
be hard to make it no Obligation for the mis-writing of a word, and therefore
it were good to search presidents, for it as a considerable case. Ask Justice
said, the meaning is obscure, and this makes the difficulty. Adjourned, Postea.

Wentworrh against Wentworth.
Hill. 1650. Banc. sup.
Mich. 1650. rot. 531.
Wentworth brought an Action of Debt against Wentworth upon an Obligation; The
Condition of it was this in effect, That whereas the Defendant had granted an
annuity to the Plaintiff, that the Defendant should make further assurance to
the Plaintiff for the enjoying thereof within one month, when he should be
thereunto required: Upon a special verdict the question was from what time the
month should begin, whether from the date of the Obligation, or from the time
of the request to be made. Latch held it should begin from the request, and not
from the date of the Obligation, because a month from that time is too small a
time to do the thing required, but if it shall be after the request it will be
a proportionable time fit for the doing it. Roll chief Justice, If there be an
indifferent construction, which may be taken two ways, Interpretation.
we will take it that way which is most reasonable to make the Obligation stand
in force, and me seems the words here are plain, namely, that the assurance
shall be made within a month after request, and not after the date of the Bond.
Ierman Justice to the same effect, and said, that although the request for
further assurance were not within one month after the date of the bond, yet the
party may require it after the month is ended, and within a month after such
request the assurance is to be made, and the Obligation shall be intended for
the benefit of the Obligor. Nicholas and Ask Justices to the same effect, so
judgment ruled for the Plaintiff, Nisi, etc.

Hill. 1649. rot. 153.
IN an Action upon the Case upon an Assumpsit made by the Defendant to pay the
Plaintiff a certain sum of money, at a certain day. Special verdict. Q. whether
a variance between the declaration, and the promise on which it was granted.
Upon a special verdict, The question was whether there were a variance
between the promise, and the Declaration, which question grew from the doubt,
whether the day of payment in the Assumpsit shall be intended according to the
old style, or according to the new, for if it were intended one way there was
no variance, if the other way there was a variance. Hales held that there was
no variance, and though there should be, yet he said the Plaintiff ought to
have Judgment; because the time in this case is not material, for the debt for
the payment whereof the promise was made, appears to be due upon an Account
made between the parties, which time is past, and grows not due upon the
Assumpsit, for this is no new promise in Law, and it is all one here as if the
promise had been set forth that he promised to pay, when he should be thereunto
required. And whereas it has been objected, that the debt upon the Account
appears to be due by two, and that the Action therefore ought to have been
brought against them both, and not against one of them as it is here, he
answered, that the Action may be brought against both, or any one of them at
the election of the party, and the custom of Merchants makes no difference in
the case, for the Law creates the debt and makes both liable, though the custom
give election to sue one or both of them, and so one may here be sued, for the
debt is by the custom transferred upon one, although it be the debt of both.
And here both the days, viz. according to the old style, and according to the
new were past before the action brought. Roll chief Justice held, Date.
that the Plaintiff ought to have Judgment; but that day shall be taken
according to the old style, Averment.
if there be not a special averment to the contrary, and so there is variance
between the pleading, and the verdict; but this does not hurt here, for the
Action does not fail, although the day be limited upon the evidence, otherwise
than it is in the Declaration, for the debt is the duty arising upon the
account made between the parties, Time.
and the day upon the Assumpsit for the payment is not material, for the Action
lies though no Assumpsit had been made, Actual promise. Debt.
and here is no need of an actual promise; But if an Assumpsit be made upon a
contract, there is no precedent duty, and so there is a difference between one
case and the other. And if two be found in arrearages of account, Custom.
by the custom of Merchants one may be charged to pay all the debt as well as
both. Ierman Justice as Roll, and said, that where the day is part of the
contract, it ought to be alleged to be past at the time of the Action brought:
but it is not so here, and also both the days are here past. Nicholas to the
same purpose, Roll chief Justice, If the Action be specially laid, and the day
made part of it, there if the Plaintiff fail in the day, his action also fails.
And if one declare generally for 100 l. upon an indebitatus, and it appears
upon the evidence, that the Defendant did owe the Plaintiff but 10 l. yet the
Plaintiff shall recover; But if the Plaintiff declare specially, Declaration.
General. Special.
viz. for a horse sold for so much, and by the evidence it appears he owed a
less sum, there the Plaintiff shall not recover, for it shall be intended
another contract, and not that, upon which the Action is brought, and so
Judgment for the Plaintiff nisi, etc. Maynard spoke again to it; But Judgment
was given for the Plaintiff upon the former reasons.

Paul Williams and his wife against the Custodes. etc.
Hill 1650. Banc. sup.
PAul Williams and his wife had a Judgment given against them at the Sessions
at Hickes Hall, Error to reverse a judgment at the Sessions for speaking words.
upon an endictment for speaking words against the Lord Fairefax, whereupon
they brought a Writ of Error in this Court to reverse the Judgment. The
Exceptions taken were these, 1. That the Justices there had not power to hold
plea for words spoken. To this the Court answered that they have power to hold
plea for such words, because they tend to breach of the peace, and the speaking
of them is a great misdemenour. The second exception was, that it is said
juratores jurati electi triatiad veritatem dicunt, and ad dicendum is left out.
3ly. There issued out a capias pro fine against the parties, whereas there was
no fine set upon them. The Court to that answered that a fine was set. Wild
took another exception, viz. that the endictment ought not to be joint against
two, for words spoken by them both; Endictment.
but several endictments, for the words of one are not the words of the other,
though they be the same words; But the Court answered, Case.
that a joint endictment was good enough, although a joint Action of the Case
cannot be brought against two, for words spoken by them both. He took also this
Exception, that it does not appear that the parties were tried in the Court,
for it is only said that they were ducti ad barram, and then that they were
removed from Hickes Hall to Newgate. The Court answered, that the words ducti
ad barram were sufficient, and it is needless to say they were tried in Court.
And therefore the whole matter rests upon the 2 d. Exception, whether the want
of the words ad dicendum be Error, and for that let the Clark of the peace be
here on Wednesday next, and then speak again to it, and then by the whole
Court the Exception was adjudged good. And the Clark of the peace was fined 40
l.

A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in an Action upon the
Case upon an Assumpsit, Error to reverse a judgment in an Action upon an
Assumpsit.
to pay Mariners wages, the Exceptions taken were first that the plaint was for
10 l. and the Declaration is to the damages of 20 l. and so there is variance
between the plaint, and the Declaration. Next the promise is laid to be made
the 1. of May, 1641 to serve the Defendant for a year, and he says that he
served him from the 1. of May for a year, whereas the 1. of May ought to be
excluded, so that he ought to say that he served for a year, from the making of
the promise. Roll chief Justice said, Variance.
that there is variance between the plaint, and the Declaration; but it is
helped by the verdict, for that finds that he has served a whole year. But two
other exceptions were taken at the Bar. 1. That the Declaration was pro salore
instead of Salario. And 2ly. It is said deserviret for deservivit. Error.
And upon these the Court ordered the Defendant in the Writ of error to show
cause why the Judgment should not be reversed.

AN Action upon the Case was brought in London for calling a woman whore, the
Defendant removed the cause into this Court, For a Procedendo into London.
whereupon the Plaintiff moved for a procedendo to try it in London, where the
action was first brought. Roll chief Justice held, that a procedendo was to be
granted, for we cannot determine the Custom; but if a Judgment be given in
London, if it be erroneous, a writ of Error may be brought in the Hustings to
try the custom, therefore take a procedendo nisi causa ostensa fuerit in
contrarium. Antea.

Mich. 1650. rot. 557.
DAvis brought an Action upon the Case against Ockham for speaking these words
of him; Demurrer to a plea in an Action for for words.
The knave the Apothecary that married my sister has poisoned my Uncle, and I
will have him taken up again to hang him. The defendant pleaded an accord
betwixt him, and the Plaintiff, that whereas the Plaintiff had done a Trespass
against him, that one Trespass should be set against the other. To this plea
the Plaintiff demurred, and Twisden said the plea was not good, and cited 16
Ed. 4. f. 89. and prayed Judgment for the Plaintiff. Latch of Council with
the Defendant said that the Accord was executed on the Defendants part, and
therefore may be pleaded in Bar. To this Roll chief Justice answered, Bar.
how have you discharged the Accord? for you do not show it. Latch took
Exceptions to the Plaintiffs Declaration. 1. That the words set forth are not
actionable, for it does not express that the Plaintiff wittingly poisoned the
Defendants Uncle, or that he did dye of the poison, and cited Hob. rep. 8.
Miles and Jacobs case. and 275. Fleetwood and Caveleys case. 2ly. There is no
Communication expressed in the Declaration to be of the Uncle, and it may be
spoken of another Uncle, and the innuendo will not hel^ it, because he may have
diverse Uncles. Twisden answered, that it is employed in the sense of the words,
that he poisoned him feloniously, and so consequently wittingly. And 2ly. He
says that he will have him dug up, and so it must be intended that he dyed
of the poison. Roll chief Justice held that the words are actionable. Case. Bar.
And 2ly. That the Defendants plea in Bar is not good, Ierman Justice held the
plea in Bar not good, but he doubted whether the Declaration was good, for it
does not appear thereby, whether the party dyed of the poison, and the latter
words help it not. Nicholas Justice, and Ask Justice agreed with (...) Roll in
all, and thereupon the r^le was Iudicium nisi, Lundi Suivant.

Custodes etc against Maine and Sergeant.
Hill. 1650. Banc. sup.
A Joint Information was exhibited against Main and Sergeant 2 Justices of
Peace, for not enquiring of a Riot, and a verdict found against them. Arrest of
judgment upon an information found.
The Defendants move in Arrest of Judgment, and by Hales show for cause that
the information ought not to have been joint against them, but several, because
their offenses are several and not joint, and here one of them is acquitted,
and so judgment cannot be given against the other that is found guilty. Roll
chief Justice answered, That as an Attachment in a Prohibition is several,
Execution.
so the execution here may be several, and it is not material though one be
acquitted, and the other found guilty. Ierman, Nicholas, and Ask Justices to
the same purpose. It was then said, that it is not necessary that the next
Justices only should remove a force, but all the Justices of the County are
bound to it: Force.
And these words in the Statute, viz. That the 2 next Justices shall do it, are
put but for convenience, and the more speedy execution of Justice. Nicholas
Justice doubted of this. Judicium nisi, pro custodibus.

Ailet against Watless.

Trin 1649. rot. 200.
IN an Action of Trespass and Ejectment, Special Verdict in Trespass and
Ejectment.
there was a special verdict found, upon which the case fell out to be this. An
Infant bargains and sells land, and is vouched to warranty, and comes in upon
the Voucher, and thereupon a common recovery is had, and upon this the question
was, whether this be such a recovery, that the Infant cannot avoid by Entry.
Hales held it could not be avoided, but did bind the Infant during his life,
but I could not hear his reasons. Wild of Council on the other side argued,
that the Infant was not bound by the recovery, because as an Infant cannot
alien his lands, so neither can he suffer a common recovery, and cited 6 rep.
28. 2ly. No record made by an Infant can bind him, and for this he cited 26 Ed.
3. Fitz. per que serve. 24.41 E. 3. f. 3.44 E. 3.10.9 Ed. 4.3^ and though it be
breve Amicabile, and by consent, yet it binds not, and 9 Car. Newports case,
where a recovery suffered by a Guardian was adjudged good, comes not to our
case; and for the intended value in a recovery, that is not material to make it
binding, for it is but a fiction, and not a real value. Roll chief Justice
demanded whether a fine be not breve amicabile; Fine. Error. Recovery.
and yet he said that that binds an Infant until it be avoided by writ of
Error. And he said that the Infant is not bound here, but the question is
whether he can avoid the recovery by Entry, or must bring a writ of Error to
avoid it. And he held that a recovery suffered by a Guardian is not good,
notwithstanding the opinion in Newports case. Hales replied, that the recovery
here is binding till it be avoided by a writ of Error, and that the Infant
cannot avoid it by his Entry, though an Infant may avoid a deed by Entry,
although it be enrolled. And here appears no consent of the parties, and the
party cannot show it, and here is a formal judgment given, which binds till it
be reversed by a writ of Error. Roll chief Justice, Entry.
An Infant may avoid a matter in paiis by Entry, but not a matter of Record,
and here is a proper way by the law to avoid it, namely by a writ of Error,
which is also matter of record, and of as high a nature. Ierman, Nicholas, and
Ask Justices to the same effect, and so judgment pro Defendente, nisi.

other things declared of a Trover de ducentis ponderibus aeris, and ducentis

Denton against Caket.

Trin. 1650. rot. 150.
DEnton brought an Action upon the Case against Caket for speaking these words,
Demurrer to a plea in Bar of an Action upon the case for words.
He and his fellows have stolen her (having speech of a Cow of the Defendants)
and I do charge him with flat felony: By reason of which words he was taken and
imprisoned. The Defendant pleaded an award made (by Sir John Rivers, and Sir
Nicholas Miller two Justices of Peace) between the parties in Bar. Twisden of
Council with the Plaintiff said, that the award does not bind the Plaintiff, for
the award concerns only the speaking of the words, and speaks nothing of the
imprisoment: And 2ly. the Award is not good, for there is not satisfaction made
by it on both parties. Wild of Council with the Defendant held, that the
Declaration was not good, and that therefore he needs not to justify the plea;
for though it should be ill, yet the Plaintiff can have no judgment, and he
said the Declaration was naught, because it alleged no day when, nor place
where the Defendant charged the Plaintiff with the felony, and made him to be
imprisoned. Twisden answered that there is a place alleged, and that though
there were none, yet it is well enough for part, and judgment may be given for
that. To which Roll chief Justice agreed. Wild replied, then the plea is good.
But the Court answered, it is not, and what say you to the Arbitrament? Wild
answered, it was good, to which Ierman and Ask Justices assented. Roll chief
Justice answered, It is a benefit to the Parish; and so to the Overseers of the
poor. Nicholas Justice to the same purpose. Roll chief Justice said, that the
Declaration is ill, and the Plea also, for the Plea is entire, Declaration.
Plea.
and yet goes not to all the matter alleged in the Declaration, but the plea is
only to part of them, and therefore if any part of the Declaration be good,
judgment ought to be given against the Defendant for that part, and the plea
in Bar is naught, so judgment ought to be entirely for the Plaintiff. But it is

Hill. 1650. Banc. sup.
Pasch. 1650. rot. 100.
ROsyer an Executor brought an Action upon the Case upon an Assumpsit against
Langdale a Feme Administratrix, Error to reverse a judgment in an Assumpsit by
an Executor against an Administratrix.
and declares that the Defendant, in consideration that he would forbear suit
until she had taken out Letters of Administration, did assume and promise to
pay unto him the Plaintiff a certain sum of money owing unto him by the
Intestate. Upon Issue joined, and a Verdict and a Judgment for the Plaintiff,
The Defendant brought a writ of Error to reverse the Judgment. And Baldwin of
his Council took these Exceptions. 1. That the Plaintiff had set forth no
consideration in his Declaration for the Assumpsit; for all that is alleged is,
that the Plaintiff should forbear suit till the Defendant had taken out Letters
of Administration, which is no consideration at all, for the Defendant was not
liable to be sued as Administratrix, until she had taken out Letters of
Administration, except there were a cause depending, as here is not. And he
cited Hob. rep. Bidwell and Cottons case, That if there be a suit commenced,
though there be no cause for it, yet forbearance to sue is a good cause to
ground an Assumpsit upon. Assumpsit.
A second Exception was that the Venire facias is not awarded per Curiam, nec
in Curia. Roll chief Justice held the 1. a good Exception, for the Defendant
was not chargeable before Letters of Administration taken forth, if she do not
intermedle with the goods of the Intestate, and it does not appear here that
she did, neither is the Defendant compellable to take forth Letters of
Administration, for they may be granted to the next of Kin if the Ordinary
pleases, according as the Statute ordains. Ierman, Nicholas, and Ask Justices
to the same intent, thereupon the rule was reversetur, nisi, etc. But because
Day being of Council on the other side took some Exceptions to the writ of
Error and the retorn thereof, It was adjourned.

Staples.
Hill. 1650. Banc. sup.
THe Court was moved to supersede a scire sacias brought by a prisoner of the
Marshalsea, For a Supersedeas to a Scire sacias.
upon the late Act for discharging of poor prisoners, because the Certificate
of the cause for which he was a prisoner was false, and so the proceedings
erroneous, for the party was in execution for Trespass, which is not within the
Statute made for the prisoners. 2ly. Because there was no due notice given to
the party, at whose suit he lay in execution, as the Statute does direct there
should. The Court ordered to view the Certificate, (...). Den une^.
and to file it, otherwise there should be no proceedings upon the scire
facias, and directed the party to demur upon the scire facias, if it be not
good, because the matter alleged cannot be pleaded to it.

Custodes against Arskot.
Hill. 1650. Banc. sup.
MAynard moved the Court for one Arskot that was outlawed for murder, For time
to bring a Writ of Error.
and had leave to bring his writ of Error, that he may have longer time to
bring it, because the King uses to sign the writ, and the Parliament had not
ordered who shall do it now, and therefore the Attorney General must advise
with the Parliament about it, which cannot speedily be done, Thereupon time was
granted till the Attorney could conveniently do it.

Newcomin against Leigh.
Hill. 1650. Banc. sup.
Pasch. 16^0. rot. 52.
LEigh did assume and promise unto Newcomin, Whether a good Assumpsit.
that if Newcomin would take one Lo for his Debtor, in the room of one Cooper,
and would spare Lo until such a time for the money, that then he would pay the
money to Newcomin, if he did not, and upon this Assumpsit Newcomin brought his
Action against Leigh. The question was whether this were a good Assumpsit. And
the Court held it was not, because it is a collateral thing, and he does not
say that he will discharge Cooper, and so Newcomin may sue Cooper
notwithstanding the Assumpsit; For though it may be it was the intention of the
parties to discharge Cooper, yet it appears not so by the words of the
Assumpsit set forth: And it was then said by Roll. That if I promise to pay to
John a Down a Debt which John a Style owes to John a Down; Nudum pactum.
this is nudum pactum.

Bawsy and Lowdall.
Hill. 1650. Banc. sup.
Pasch. 1650. rot. 275.
Upon a special verdict in an Action of Trespass and Ejectment, Special
Verdict upon the devise of a Copyhold in Fee.
the case in effect was this. A man seized of Copyhold lands in fee, devisable
by Custom, devises them in this manner, I give and bequeath my lands, etc. to
my son Richard, during his natural life, and after to the heir of his body for
ever. Hales of Council with the Plaintiff made these questions, 1. whether by
the words of the Will a Fee-simple at the Common Law passes because there is
an estate to Richard for life, and after to his heir in the singular number.
And he argued that the word heir includes heirs, because it is Nomen
Collectivum: Next, Whether the devising the land to Richard for his natural
life, and after to his heir for ever, makes any difference in the Case, and he
held it did not, and said, that Archers case that is objected by the other side
differs much from this, for there the words are restrained; for it is Proximo
Haeredi, and not Haeredi generally, as it is in our Case; and there the words
next heir are not words of limitation, but of purchase, and to decipher the
person, but not to limit the estate; and in our case if there should not be a
limitation, Richard should only take for life, which is not the intent of the
Will, as may appear by the passages, and clauses of it. And Thomas and Kemishes
case, in 5 Car. in this Court makes an end of our Case. Neither does the adding
of the word in perpetuum make a difference in the Case, for if the words had
been omitted, the same estate had passed to the Tenant, Richard and his Estate
is not enlarged by them. 2ly. The words in perpetuum relate to all the Estate,
and not to any particular Estate, and so the surrender made by R. Hunt is good.
Next of all, supposing that it be a limited Estate, and a contingent remainder,
the question will then be whether this contingent remainder be destroyed or no,
and I conceive it is, because the particular Copyhold estate, which must
support this contingent remainder is destroyed, and the Law is the same in that
point in Copyhold cases, as it is in other cases at the Common Law, for
Copyholds are directed by the rules of the Common Law, 13 Iac. Banc. Reg. It is
also held, that there is the same rule to support a contingent remainder of a
Copyhold as there is of Land at the Common Law. Next it is to be considered
whether the particular Copyhold estate, be extinguished or not. And it is clear
that it is, for the customary Estate is in the Lord who has the Fee simple,
which cannot both stand together, and so there is no estate to support the
contingent remainder Copyhold, and consequently all objections are by this
answered. 1. That the surrender shall not do wrong. 2ly. That the surrender
destroys not the Custom. Turner on the other side argued, that only an estate
passes to Richard for life, and that the word Heir is not a word of
limitation, to make the Ancestor take a Fee simple, neither shall the word Heir
be taken Collective here but singulariter, and so according to the common
sense, number, and matter ought it to be construed. And Nowns Collective in the
singular number do not signify the same thing, that they do in the plural
number, as may be proved by other examples, and there is no proper name to
signify one particular Heir in Law, if the word Heir in the singular number
shall not do it, Shellyes case, 1. Rep. f. 101. and ^ooks institut. f. 8.1.
Rep. Archers case. And there are two Judgments in the Common pleas in the very
point, as I am informed by the Attorney on our side. In a Will the word Heir
shall not be taken Coliective; out in the natural grammatical sense, and not
as a word of art; but it is otherwise taken perchance in conveyances, which are
made by men of Art, and learned in the Laws, whereas wills are made commonly by
lay gents, and unskilful in the Law; And the rule is, that words shall be
interpreted to make all the parts of a deed in which they are to stand
together, and to bear sense, and to be in esse, and effectual, which cannot be
here if the word heir shall be taken Collective; but may be if it be taken
singulariter. Hob. rep. Stukely and Butlers case. Next if the word heir should
be taken Collective, then the Estate for life would merge, 30 El. C. B. Hill. 3
Iac. C. B. Hiller and Lewis his case. 3ly. Rich. has only an Estate for life,
if it were otherwise the Testator would have otherwise expressed it and he has
well expressed an estate for life, and no other Estate in him. If one grant 4.
parts of his manor, it shall pass 4. parts of 5. and not all. For the other
point the contingent remainder is not here destroyed by the destruction of the
Copyhold Estate, for Copyhold Estates do not depend one upon another as Estates
of the Common Law do, and here is one in esse to take the Estate. Another
question he spoke to, viz. whether a Lessee at will being ousted by a stranger
can reenter, and he held he cannot, for he has but a mere right, 38 H. 6. f.
27. Fortescue and Yelverton, 3. Iac. Banc. Reg. rot. 501. Carpenter and
Collins. But to this Roll chief Justice, Entry.
and Nicholas Justice answered, that he may enter notwithstanding it has been
heretofore controverted, and the reason is, because he has the primer
posse^sion. Roll chief Justice inclined that the contingent remainder is not
destroyed, because it does not here depend upon the particular Estate; but it
ought to expect till the remainder happen; and he conceived that the word heir,
and heirs, were all one here by the intent of the parties, and the frame of the
conveyance. Ask Justice said, that it is a good Estate of Fee simple
conditional executed in Richard. Ierman Justice, The intent in a Will, if it
be not contrary to Law, ought to be taken, and there must be words to make the
intent appear, and these words must stand together, and shall not be made void,
and he conceived the contingent remainder not destroyed. Adjourned till the
next Term. Postea.

Port against Midleton.
Hill. 1650. Banc. sup.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in an Action of debt
upon an obligation, Error to reverse a judgment in debt
and the Error insisted upon was in the entering of the Judgment, which was
quod recuperet Debitum suum, and does not say praedictum. Roll chief Justice
answered, Delivery. Escrow.
that the debt is confessed by the party, and the question is whether the deed
was delivered as an escrow or not; but it was delivered to the party himself,
and therefore could not be delivered as an escrow. Ierman Justice said, that
debitum suum without praedictum is not good, for the word praedictum is verbum
operativum. Ask Justice as Roll, and there is but one debt, Implication.
and the word ideo in the record implies it to be the same debt. Nicholas to
the same effect. The rule was affirmetur nisi causa die Iunae sequenti.

Intestate, and after moved the Court that he might have a scire sacias to
revive the Judgment obtained by the former Administrator. But the Court
answered, that he could not have it; but must begin a new Action, for the debt
against the party.

Hill. 1650. Banc. sup.
ONe was endicted for speaking these words against a Mayor of a City, To quash
an endictment.
viz. you are a forsworn man, and have broken your oath. Hales moved to quash
the endictment, because the words have no reference to the Mayor in respect of
his office. Ierman Justice answered, that the speaking of the words is a breach
of the good behavior, and thought it fit the Defendant should plead to the
endictment, to which the Court at first inclined. But afterward ruled the
other party to show cause on Monday following why it should not be quashed.

The Countess Rivers case.
Hill. 1650. Banc. sup.
THe Countess Rivers was arresten by a bill of Midlesex, and prays in Court
by her Council that the Writ may abate, Arguments touching privilege of
peerage not to be arrested.
and the Precept, and pleads her patent, whereby she was created a Countess,
and so pleads that she ought not to be arrested. Latch of Council against the
Countess argued that her patent was not good, because it wants the words of
investiture, which are material words in the making of an Earl or Countess,
for although the Act of investiture may be omitted, because she is a woman and
she cannot be girt with a sword, yet she may be clothed with a mantle, as it
is in the Institutes, f. 16. and so was it in the case of Ann Bullein that was
made Marchioness of Winchester by King Henry the 8. and of the Lady Finch, made
Countess of Winchelsea by King James, 6 Iac. Pasch. 1. but in this Case there
was a non obstante, to dispense with the clause of investiture, and in the
viscount Barkleys case, the patent whereby he was made Earl of Nottingham was
adjudged naught, for want of this clause. 2ly. It does not appear by the
patent, that she is made an English Countess, and then she has no privilege, 8
Rich. 2. Banc. Reg. 204. 11 E. 3. Banc. re. 473. Neither is there any relation
to the patent to any place, of which she is made a Countess. For although the
patent be sealed with the English broad Seal, this is not material, for
outlandish honors may be granted by the broad Seal of England. 3ly. The cause
that she shall have privilege of an English Countess is not material, because
she is not made an English Countess, and she is no Countess to have privilege
against the Common Law, although she may (it may be) have her privilege in
point of honor in the Marshalls Court and Heralds office, because there is no
public good and service in making her a Countess, 43 E 3.4. for being a woman
she cannot be employed in Arms, or otherwise for the public. And an
Ambassador cannot have privileges granted him, which do not concern him as an
Ambassador, Dyer 60. and 1.1 H. 7. rot. 24 C. Banc. The King cannot grant one
to be exempted from arresting, as it is in Cooks Mag. Char. Pasc. 7 H. 8. rot.
66 C. B. for the reason of that clause of Magna charta nulli negabimus
Iusticiam. The King cannot grant a Sanctuary to protect men from the arrests of
his subjects, 29 Ass. 34. Keiw. 190. And there is no instance to be given of a
woman made a Countess, that was ever free and protected from arresting. In the
Statute of 20 H. 6. C. 9. for Earls wives, and 21 H. 8. to qualify Chaplains,
there is no notice taken of Countesses by creation, but only of Countesses
dowagers, or Countesses by descent, 6 rep. 9. C. de Rutlands case, and Ann
Bullein was tried per pares as she was Queen, and not as she was Marchioness of
Winchester. And further the privileges of Earls and Countesses are now extinct,
for the cause of those privileges, viz. the King and house of Lords are
extinct, and gone, and the privilege of being free from arrests is a privilege
executory, and not executed. Neither does the sufficiency of their possessions
only give them the privilege not to be arrested; but their public scrvices to
the State, which is the final cause of the privilege, and the other was but a
partial cause, and not the sole cause. Reliefs were paid by Barons and Earls,
when Earldoms and Baronies were created; but they are not now paid as they
were then, but according to the value of the possessions now, and Amercements
of Earls and Barons were equal. The privileges of Earls and Barons was derived
originally from Soldiers, after it was derived to Bishops, and great
Counselors, and so it appears that they were privileged in respect of public
employments, and not by reason of their revenues. All the Abbots and Priors had
the privilege not to be arrested, yet all were not Lords of the Parliament, 21
E. 3. Mich. 59. Tres. Mich. 7 H. 7. pl. 7.31 E. 3 process. 54.27 H. 8.7.7 H.
6.11.29 E. 3. f. 30. Dyer 315. And a Judgment without a Capiatur was in
Trespass against a Bishop, because the King was to have no fine, 14 H. 7.21.
But it is not so in a temporal peer, where the King is to have a fine. The
privileges have several expressions, and the reasons for the privileges of the
lay peerage is fully expressed in the Writs directed to them, Regist. 287.247.
Rast. Exigent. Britton 88.10 H. 4.15. per Hull. 14 H. 6.2. per Newton. 39 E. 3.
f. 35. Hill. 14 Eliz. Dyer 314.3 H 6. f. 38.48 E. 3. f. 3.35 H. 6.46. for other
privileges they are not allowable: And now also all tenures as well as the
House of Lords is taken away by the late Act; and though her privilege do
continue, yet she has not taken the right way to have it allowed; for she
ought to have brought a writ out of the Chancery to have it allowed, and not to
have done it die a dilatory plea, 8 H. 6.9 and 10. and the Patent cannot try
whether she be a Countess or not, 9 rep. 31. Inst. 16 b. 6 rep. 63. And lastly
mischief and misery will ensue to many, if this privilege should be allowed,
and the very matter speaks for it self, and so he prayed judgment for the
Plaintiff. Hales of Council on the other side prayed the privilege might be
allowed, and he followed Latch in the points of this Argument: And first he
said, that the thing grounded by the Patent is only in creation of the dignity,
and there is no need here of investiture, for if there were, then a recital of
it should be also necessary, but because it needs not, therefore it needs no
recital of it in the Patent. Seldens Tit. of honor, f. 876.21 R. 2. There is a
recital of an Investiture, but there was no Investiture, and so it was not
material, and a non obstante is to no purpose to dispense with the want of
Investiture, if it were necessary, and the reason of the making the new Patent
of the Lord Barkeley was not for the want of the Clause of Investiture, for the
Investiture is a ceremony of the Heralds, and not essential to the Honor. And
although there be no certain place of denomination of the place of the Earldom,
yet is the Patent good, for it may be out of England, and yet she may be an
English Countess notwithstanding, Although I agree that foreign honors may be
granted by the Broad Seal of England; but here be sufficient words to express
her to be an English Countess, and the most proper that can be, viz. the
Patent. Creations of such honors have been frequent, and she has also a
sufficient estate to support her dignity: I confess that it is true that no
person can be privileged from Arrest by grant; but here the privilege ensues
the Patent of her Counteship by Custom and Law, as incident to it. The King
cannot grant a privilege to imprison, but if he grant a Court, the power to
imprison follows necessarily upon it; And the privilege which the Law gives to
the person of a Countess, is that which exempts her from Arrest, as it appears
in the Case of a Countess by Marriage, and a Countess by Creation is more
honorable than a Countess by Marriage; and therefore ought to have as high
privileges as the other; and the Statute made concerning Countesses, the wives
of Earls and Barons do appertain to a Countess created; for those Statutes were
but an affirmance of the Common Law, and did introduce no new Law. This
privilege is not taken away, for it arose by Custom and by the Common Law, and
not from Foreiners, as Latch conceives, and so the reason of that cannot be as
he urges, but by the privilege of the person which indures as well when there
is no Parliament, as when there is, and this privilege is during life, and not
like to a privilege granted by reason of employment. For a Countess Dowager
has no more reason to be privileged, in relation to military employment than a
Countess by Creation, and by the late Act no employment is taken away; And for
the Clergy they were privileged from Arrests, not because of employment, but by
reason of the eminency of their persons. There may be an Earl or a Baron by
writ or by prescription, and there it ought to be certified by writ; but here
the honor being by Creation, the Patent may be pleaded to certify it, as well
as if it were certified by writ, and to plead it thus is the more proper way. A
Baron ought not to be styled Dominus in a writ, but by his Christian name, and
addition of Knight, if he be one, if he have no special name of Barony in his
Creation. Roll chief Justice demanded, if one be made a Baron, and be not
called to the Parliament by writ, or comes thither by virtue of some clause in
his Patent, shall he be exempted from Arrest? quasi diceret non. And if one
heretofore had had twenty Knights fees, Privilege.
could he have come to the Parliament by reason of them? And held that the
privilege is not allowable, for she never had reference to the Parliament, or
to do any other public service. Ierman, Nicholas, and Ask Justices agreed
with Roll in all. Roll said, If the King grant a Town to be a Borough, the
grant gives it not privilege to send a Burgess to the Parliament, except there
be special words in the Patent to warrant it; but if he make a County it is
otherwise by Statute. Adjourned.

Hayward against Williams
Hill 1650. Banc. sup.
Hill. 1649. rot. 824.
THe Case was this, Whether a Writ of Error well brought.
A Feme was sued as a Feme sole, but by the surname of her Husband, she being
Covert Baron, and Judgment was given against her, and the Baron brought a writ
of Error. The question was, whether the writ of Error was well brought by the
Baron. It was then said, That if a Feme Covert levy a fine as a Feme sole, if
her Baron die she shall not defeat it, but the Baron may defeat it during her
life. 18 E. 4, 40.7.
Roll chief Justice to the case at the Bar said, how can the Baron bring a writ

judgment? But let us see books, for the case is considerable. Postea.

be no supersedeas of Execution, this Court may grant execution. Roll chief
Justice said, it may, for otherwise the Act is to no purpose. Latch said, the
Record is not now in this Court, and therefore there can be no Execution
granted here. Roll chief Justice answered, you have confessed by your pleading,
namely by your Demurrer, that the Record is here so far as to grant Execution.
Therefore let there be Execution, except cause be showed to the contrary the
day the next term. But afterward the Court said, they would not grant it, but
said the party might take execution at his peril.

A Certiorari was directed to the County Palatine of Chester to remove a cause

viz. that they have jurisdiction of the cause, and that therefore they are not
to certify it. Sergeant Glyn argued, that this retorn was not good, for this
Court has jurisdiction over all the Courts in England in writs mandatory, 34
Ass. 7.19 H. 6.12. And an Act of Plarliament does not take away the power of
this Court, if it run not in the negative; but in writs remedial it is not so
general as it is in this case, and the cause may be well enough tried here,
notwithstanding it be concerning a matter which arises in the County Palatine,
as the Statute 9 Ed. 3. C. ^. is. 2ly. It appears that the Mayor and Citizens
of Chester are parties, and so they will try their own cause, and this appears
by the Record, and this they ought not to do, 21 H. 7. f. 33. lib. Ass. 332. 37

matter of the suit did arise within the jurisdiction of the City, what say you
to that? Jurisdiction.
for they have not shown any cause why they should have jurisdiction. Return.

that the submission to stand to the Award was conditional, viz. so that the

Action brought is for not performing an Award made the 24 day of the same
Month; so it appears not whether the Award were delivered upon the 27 day, or
no, and so it may be that the condition is not broken. Roll chief Justice
answered, the question is whether it be an Award before the delivering it up or
no. Therefore let the Judgment stay till the Plaintiff move, Award.

ending at Michaelmas 1648. and so for two years rent behind he brings his
Action, whereas there cannot be such a rent due for such a Term; for although
the rent be due for the whole year at Michaelmas, yet the term of 2 years is
not ended at Michaelmas, for that is upon the 29 day of September, whereas the
2 years end not till the 6 of October following. Roll chief Justice answered,
the rent for the 2 years was due at Michaelmas, Rent.
and take all the words together the Declaration is good enough, although the
expression be not so proper as it might have been. Nicholas and Ask as Roll,

Defendant, and his heirs, a Copyhold according to the custom of the manor, the
Defendant did assume and promise unto the Plaintiff to pay unto him 500 l. and
for breach of this promise he brought his Action, and obteins a verdict against
the Defendant. The Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, and took this
exception, viz. that the consideration on the Plaintiffs part was not
performed, for the consideration was, that he should surrender the Copyhold to
the Defendant and his Heirs, and he has set forth the surrender to be into the
hands of a Copyhold Tenant of the manor to the use of the Defendant, which is
no surrender, Surrender.
until it be presented at the next Court, and so it is uncertain, whether it
shall take effect or no. Roll chief Justice said, It is expressed to be
secundum consuetudinem manerii, yet this is not sufficient, for it is not an
effectual surrender until it be presented at the Court. Therefore let
Judgment stay till the Plaintiff move.

not this dilatory plea. The Court thereupon ordered that he should show cause,
why he should not plead in chief, and said his plea was dilatory, and so it had
been ruled lately in the case of the Earl Rivers.

Fielder and Tovye.
Hill. 1650. Banc. sup.
Pasc. 1651. rot. 430.
FIelder brought an Action of debt upon an obligation, Demurrer to a
Declaration in debt upon an obligation
the Defendant prayed Oyer of the Bond, and upon view thereof demurs to the
Plaintiffs Declaration, and for cause shows that the Plaintiff declares for
quadragint. libris, and the Bond is quadragent libris, and so there is a
variance. To this it was answered by Green, that this is no material
difference, for the words sound alike, and there is more difference between dra
and drin than between ginta and genta, and between dra and drin has been held
no material variance, and quadragent. is not utterly uncertain here, for
either it must be 40. or 400. and the condition of the obligation explains the
sum, and the Plaintiff here declares but for 40 l. and so it appears in the
Record. In Osbornes case octogenta was for octogint. and yet held good, and
Hob. 18. Logards case Trigintat instead of triginti, and in Walter and Pigots
case Septingent. is used for septuagent. and Pary and Days case quinquegent.
for quinquagint. and these held no material variances. Latch on the other side
said the word in the Bond is uncertain, and the condition has nothing in it,
to reduce it to a certain signification, and if it make any certainty in it it
must make it signify 400 l. and then the Plaintiff has failed in his
Declarasion, and Hobarts case differs from this, and as for Osborns case it is
variously reported, and so not to be relied on. Roll chief Justice, What say
you to sessanta? But the question here is, what shall be meant by the word
whether 40. or 400. And in Fi^z^^ berts case, Judgment was given upon a
demurrer, Variance.
that gent for gint was a material variance, and our case is all one with that.
If the doubt be whether it should be 40. or 400. how shall we know the intent
of the parties? and if it be certain it must he understood 400. and the Action
is brought but for 40. l. 44 Eliz. Mich. rot. 1301. Gray and Davis case,
Sexgint. was adjudged to be a Bond of 60 l. and not of 600 l. And it is the
gent. and gint. in all the cases that makes the difference. And the case of
sessanta comes not to our case, and so concluded Judgment to be against the
Plaintiff. Ierman Nicholas, and Ask Justices of the same opinion. Nicholas
Justice said, that false Latin in a Bond does not make it naught; but he held
this Bond was for 400 l. and not 40 l. and it is not uncertain for the grammar
rule, ginta notat december, sed genta numero centum, does hold here. Antea.

Gay against Gay.
Pasc. 1651. Banc. sup.
Trin. 1650. rot. 1350.
Upon a special verdict found in a replevin; Whether an estate tail or fee
conditional.
The case was this, A man seized of a Copyhold Borough English, devised it to
H. his grandchild, and to his Heirs, and if he dye during the life of his
mother, the remainder to H. his younger brother, and to his heirs. The question
here was whether here be an Estate tail in H. or a Fee simple executory. If it
be an Estate tail, then the devise was said not good, because it is of a
Copyhold, but if it be a Fersimple, Limitation.
then it is a good devise. Roll chief Justice said, that a limitation of an
inheritance after an absolute Fee simple is not a good limitation, for this
would be to make a perpetuity, which the Law will not admit, Perpetuity.
but if it be upon a contingent Fee simple it is otherwise. Adjournatur. Postea.

Heal against Green.
Pasc. 1651. Banc. sup.
Hill. 649 rot. 370.
IN an Action of Trespass and ejectment, Case upon a special verdict in
trespass, and ejectment.
upon a special verdict sound, the case proved to be this. A man seized of a
manor that had diverse Tenants that held for lives by old rents devises it to
his wife, during her life, with power to let and set, and make estates out of
them, in as ample manner as the Testator might, if he were living. The questions
were made by Latch. 1. Whether this power given her to set, and set, etc. does
not alter her Estate for life in the Lands devised to her. 2ly. Whether this
power given her by the Will, adds any power to her estate for life, to make
estates, and he held for the first, that the power given her did not alter her
Estate. And 2ly. that it ads no power unto her Estate, because the clause in
the Will, is one entire clause, and not double and accumulative, and so she can
make no greater Estates, than her estate for life will bear. And for the
objection that is made. That then the words that limit the power to her are
void, and idle. He answered, that it is not necessary that all the words in a
Will should give something; but some words may be explanatory of other words,
and so are these words here, and yet the words here may add something to her
Estate, viz. to enable her to make Estates without impeachment of waste. And
the words shall not be intended of the time of Execution of the Estates made by
the Feme, for then they are idle, Hill. 1 Car. Banc. Reg. Danyel and Vplins
case. One may dispose an estate by Will for life, with power to make Estates to
continue after the death of the party that made them. But here the estate is
made only out of the interest of the wife, which cannot endure after her life,
Pasc. 44. Eliz. Bible and Dringhouse, and so prays Judgment for the
Plaintiff. Hales for the Defendant made these questions, 1. What power was
given by the Will; 2ly. Whether it were well executed; and he held the feme
being executrix has but an Estate for life; But she has a power to make
estates, as she has done. There is no question but such a power may be added.
The question only is if this power be added here in our case, and he said it
was added by the express words of the will, for else those words are frivolous,
and operate nothing. In Danyel and Vplins case cited, which was entered, 20 Iac.
Hill. 720. there is no express Estate given to the party, but a mere power
only, and it was not by reason of the words added, for they are only
conjunctive words. And Justice Whitlock held there that the first words gave
the power; Though Justice Jones differed in opinion, and that case is the very
same with ours; The reason in our case, That the words give power to the feme,
may appear by the comparing this part of the Will with the other parts of it.
In other parts of the Will where things are devised to his wife, these words
here used are not added, and that argues that the Testator intended the Feme
more power, than in other things devised to her, and the words themselves being
a devise of a manor, proves by the nature of the thing, that the Testator
intended to give power to the Feme, to make Estates out of the manor. And it
cannot be intended, that the words In as ample manner, etc, do only give the
feme power to assign over her term, Vaughan and Longs case, 24 C. the words
were adjudged to be words to enlarge the power of the Legatee, and so are they
here. And the subsequent clause during the term of her life, restrains not the
power, for these words may be either referred to the Estates to be made, or to
the time of making them, and here they are referred to the execution of the
power, and this is more suitable to the intention of the party in ordinary
reason, and they are added to expound the intent, viz. that the remainder
limited over shall not hinder the feme, for he has not barred her out, and
has imposed this trust in her as Executrix, and as Legatee. And for the 2d.
point here is a good Execution of the power, for it arises partly out of her
interest, and partly out of her Authority, and both may well stand together,
and the Estate made out of both is a good Estate, or if not, the Estate may be
intended to arise out of the power given her to make such an Estate, and not
out of her interest, and the joining of her daughter is not material, though
no good estate be derived from her, and so he prayed Judgment for the
Defendant. Roll chief Justice, It is usual in the West of England to make
Estates for lives upon the old rent; but it is not here expressed of what
nature this manor is, or whether it used to be let, and here is no limitation
to let for lives. But here either the laster words are idle, or else the Feme
has such a power, that she may destroy the remainder. And itsh all not be
intended that he trusted his Executrix, with more than he gave her, and the
words of the Will do not express that, and the question is how it shall be
interpreted. The words may be interpreted Cumulative. Interpretation.
otherwise the feme has power to destroy the remainder, which would be a hard
construction. To which Nicholas assented. Roll chief Iustie, The intention of
the Testator is not clear to give this power to the Feme; but if it did appear
to be his meaning, it might be otherwise; and here it is in a Will. And the
Verdict is not well drawn up, for the Case might have been made better; for all
the land may be in Demesite for ought appears by the Verdict. Adjourned to be
argued again, Postea.

Webb against Wilmer.

Hill. 1650. rot. 309.
Webb brought an Action of Debt for rent reserved by him upon a lease for
years made to Wilmer, Arrest of Judgment in Debt for rent reserved upon a
Lease for years.
and obtains a Verdict. The Defendant moved in Arrest of Judgment, and alleged
for cause that the Plaintiff had abated his writ. The case was this, Webb
leaseth certain lands to Wilmer for years, reserving a rent, with a clause of
re-entry for not payment, the rent being behind, the Lessor brings an Action of
Debt for the rent, and pending the suit reenters into the land, and after the
Lessee reenters. The question here was, whether the writ once abated by the
Plaintifs entry, Reviver. Abatement.
pending the writ, were revived by the Defendants re-entry. Roll chief Justice
held it was not. Twisden argued, that the writ is not abated, but only abatable
by plea, and so this matter is not to be offered to stay the Judgment, 5 H. 7.
f. 47. and he has pleaded nothing in abatement, but to the Action only, and he
said that it now being after a verdict, it is helped by the Statute. Hales on
the other side said, that it does here appear that the Plaintiff has no cause
of Action, for he was in possession when he brought the Ejectment. Roll
answered, If one declare having no cause of Action, Declaration. Departure.
if there be cause afterward, it is well enough. But here is a departure, and
the 1. Ejectment is not revived, for it is purged by the re entry. The rule was
nil capiat per billam, nisi.

writ of Error, and took these exceptions. 1. That it does not appear that the
Endictment was at the Quarter Sessions, as it ought to be by the Statute of 5
Ed. 6. for it is only said to be ad generalem Sessionem. Roll chief Justice
answered, if it be ad generalem Sessionem it may be intended the Quarter
Sessions. Intendment.
2ly It was objected that there is no Capiatur awarded in the judgment, as
there ought to be. The Court answered they would advise.

Exceptions. 1. That the Plaintiff declares for a thing, the conusance whereof
lies out of the jurisdiction of the Court, Jurisdiction.
for it is for wages to be paid upon the performance of a Voyage to be made in
locis transmarinis. Roll chief lustice said, this was a good Exception, for
they cannot enquire at Bristow whether the party has performed his Voyage or
not. The 2d. Exception was, that the Plaintiff declares that the Defendant was
indebted to him in such a sum of money, to render him an account. The Court
answered, this is not good, Account. Debt.
for in such case an Action of account lies, and not an indebitatus assumpsit,
And for these causes the Judgment was reversed, nisi; and pronounced by Ierman
Justice (at the prayer of the Plaintifs Counsel) in English, being the first
that was pronounced so in this Court, according to the late Act for proceedings

good to found the Action, and it was then also said, that a Trover and
Conversion lies for goods found and converted, although they come afterward to

Rich against Sanders.
Pasch. 1651. Banc. sup.
Hill. 1649. rot. 758.
Rich brought an Action of Trespass against Sanders for taking away his Corn
set forth for tithes; Special verdict in Trespass for tithes upon the words of
a Will.
upon issue joined a special Verdict was found, whereupon the case fell out to
be upon the construction of the words of a will, which were these, I give all
my free lands wheresoever to my Brother John Sanders and his heirs, upon
condition that he suffer my wife to enjoy all my Freelands in Holford for life,
the Testator having only a portion of tithes of inheritance in Holford, and no
lands. The question here was, whether this portion of tithes shall be accounted
free lands within the intent of the will, and so the wife be to have them
during her life. Twisden held, the tithes were not devised by the will to the
Feme; for if I devise my fee-simple lands to John a Style and his heirs, tithes
do not pass by this devise, for tithes are a collateral thing arising out of
land, and not part of the land it self. 42 Ed. 3. f. 13. 10 Iac. Moyle and
Ewers case, 31 Eliz. Perkins and Hyndes case. In the will here they pass not,
for there are no words in the will to devise them, nor can the words he so
expounded, and here are other lands devised to satisfy the words of the will.
A term for years has more relation to land than tithes; and a term could not
have passed by the words of the will. Next, the second Clause does not pass the
tithes, for there is no such thing as is expressed in it; but if it should pass
to the wise by implication, yet it cannot pass to John Sanders the Brother; for
there are neither express words nor any implication to devise this portion of
tithes to him, but the contrary rather is to be collected from the Will. Wadham
Windham on the other side answered, that the Testator calls the tithes in
Holford his free lands. It is true generally, that by the devise of lands
tithes do not pass, but in a will by the intent of the Devisor they may pass,
and the word land includes all real things in common intention and legal
construction, as Lutrels Case is, 1 Mar. Bro. Tit. Elegit. An Elegit may be of
a rent, and tithes have a nearer relation to land than rent have. 2ly. Here is
an apparent intention to devise the tithes; for he explains his meaning in his
second clause of the Will, that he intends tithes by the word lands. 44 Eliz.
Com. Banc. Gery against Gery, the question there was, what passed by the word
rents, whether lands passed. The words were, as to all my lands in Dale I
devise my rents, etc. and here the matter comes in by a Proviso, which enlarges
the matter, Trin. 3 Iac. Fitz. Williams case; One devised all his goods,
Jewels, and Plate, excepting his lease in C There it was adjudged that all his
other Leases passed. 4 Ed. ^. Br. grants 51. Another circumstance in the Will
enforces this construction, viz. the word wheresoever, which word expresses
the intent of the Devisor to be so, otherwise that word will be idle, and to no
purpose. Hob. rep. Stukely and Butlers case: It may also appear out of the body
of the Will: for it appears thereby that his Daughter was provided for in his
will by his personal estate^ and that the intention was to dispose of his lands
to the Heir, and his Copyhold lands which he had in Holford were surrendered at
the time of the making of the Will, and so the devise cannot refer to them; and
besides this is called free lands, which distinguishes them from Copyhold
lands, and so he prayed judgment for the Plaintiff. Roll chief Justice, There
is a Condition annexed to the Devise, Condition.
that his wife shall enjoy this land, though the words in the Will are not very
proper to erpress it; but we must consider them as used in a Will, and not in a
conveyance. Nicholas Justice said. the Devisor himself calls them free-holds,
and this distinguishes them from Copyhold lands. Adjourned till Saturday
following to be argued again.

Dowse against Masters.

DOwse brought an Action of Debt upon an Indebitatus Assumpsit against Masters

in which the Defendant pleaded that he did deliver bills to the Plaintiff to the
value of 6 l. in which the Plaintiff was indebted to him, which bills the
Plaintiff did accept in full satisfaction; the Plaintiff replied protestando that
he was not indebted to the Defendant, that he did not receive bills to the
value of 6 l. in satisfaction: Upon this a Demurrer was joined. Roll chief
Justice said, Plea.
the Plea of the Defendant is ill, for he does not say that he delivered the
Bills in full satisfaction, but that the Plaintiff received them in full
satisfaction, which is not good, for the Plaintifs receiving of the Bills must
be as they were delivered, and not other ways, and that is not expressed:
Therefore let the Plaintiff take his judgment, nisi, etc.

and a verdict for the Plaintiff, the Defendant moved in Arrest of Judgment that
the words are not actionable, as they are rendered in English, and so the Action
lies not. Roll chief Justice, If the words sound in Welsh that the Plaintiff was

that the Defendant, in consideration that she the Plaintiff would leave her
Fathers house, and come to the House of the Defendant in such a place, did
assume and promise unto her that he would mary her, and that thereupon she did
leave her Fathers House, and did come to the Defendants House, et obtulit se in
maritagium conjungi, and because he had not performed his promise Actio
accrevit: Upon issue joined, and a verdict found for the Plaintiff, the
Defendant moved in Arrest of Judgment, and took Exceptions, that the Plaintiff
did not show in her Declaration when she left her Fathers House, and came to
the Defendants house, nor that she gave him any notice thereof. Wild moved for
judgment, notwithstanding the Exceptions; for, he said, though it be not
expressly said that she gave the Defendant notice when she came to his House,
yet it is said, quod obtulit se in maritagium conjungi, which implies the
Defendant had notice; and besides here is no need of notice; for the Assumpsit
is, that if she will come to the Defendants house he will marry her, and it is
not said that when she comes he will marry her, so that he is bound by his
promise to take notice of her coming. Roll chief Justice answered, if all the
Declaration be considered together, here is a good consideration expressed; for
this is not like to the case of tender of money. And the words obtulit se in
maritagium conjungi shall be intended to the Defendant himself, Consideration.
and then he must needs have notice of her coming thither. D ves of Counsel
with the Defendant took this Exception, that the Plaintiff in setting forth her
offer of marriage does not say tunc et ibidem, so there is neither place nor
time set forth. Roll chief Justice answered, it is after a Verdict, and you
move this Exception too late, Advantage.
and you have now lost the advantage of taking it. If there be a sufficient
notice, it is well; if not, it is not good; for there ought to be a notice, for
she may come to his house in private, so that he cannot take notice of her
coming thither. Notice.
The question only is this, whether notice be sufficiently and necessarily
employed in the words obtulit se in maritagium conjungi. Curia advisare vult.

2 Exceptions were taken, 1. That the Plaintiff did not show his Letters of
Administration, and 2ly. That there is no good consideration set forth to
ground the Assumpsit upon: for it is that the Defendant did promise, that if
the Plaintiff would forbear to take his course for the moneys, he would pay
them, which words are uncertain, and he should have said his course in Law, and
not generally his course. Roll chief Justice to the 1 answered, It is not
necessary here to show the Letters of Administration, for they are but
inducements to the Actio^, and not the ground of it; And for the second
exception the consideration is certainly enough set forth, Consideration.
although the Latin be not very proper. Therefore let the Plaintiff have his

Conversion, de ducentis Averiis. viz. bobus, juvencis, Anglice Steers,
Iuvencis, Anglice Runts, and Iuvencis, Anglice Heifers, which is uncertain, and
so judgment cannot be given, for it is uncertain for what number of each of
the Steers, Runts, and Heifers judgment should be given. Roll chief Justice
inclined that it is certain enough, Averment.

consent of the Lessor, and the Lessor thereupon brings an Action of Covenant
against the Lessee; the question was whether it did lie in regard that the
Lessor had entered into part of the land. Covenant.
Roll chief Justice held that the Covenant was collateral, and therefore it is

were taken that it does not appear by the endictment, by what authority the
Court was held, where the presentment was found. 2ly. It is not averred that
the presentment did present the casting in the soil to be any annoyance. 3ly.
There does not appear to be any process in the case against the party upon the
presentment. To the first it was answered by council on the other side, that
it is not necessary to show by what authority the Court was held, for their
Authority is by Act of Parliament, and it is a public Act to be taken notice
of. Roll the chief Justice answered, That it is a private Act made for the City
of London, and concerned the Lord Mayor, though part of it be public, Statute.
for part of an Act may be public, and another part of it private, and of
that part which is private we are not bound to take notice, and it was here

estate be extinct by the Kings leasing it for life.
to wit a Horse, Colt, and three Mares, the 13 of January, 21 Car. at Chingford
in the County of Essex in a close there called Pipers down.

THe Defendant avows the taking of the Cattle in loco quo, etc. as Bailiff unto
Thomas Boothbye, as damage feasant in the Close aforesaid, being the soil and
the freehold of the said Thomas Boothby.

Upon the pleading, the case appeared to be as follows.
KIng Henry the 8. being seized in Fee in the right of his Crown in the manner
of Chingford Comitis in the County of Essex, of which manor a certain tenement
called Lormiers alias Heriots with the appurtenances, whereof the said Close
called Pipers Down was parcel, which tenement and Close were parcel of the
said manor, and was then, and had been time out of mind demised, and
demiseable in Fee by Copy of Court roll, of the said manor, did build a new
message upon the said Tenement, and did afterward by his Letters patents,
under the great seal grant the office of Keeper, and keeping of the said
message, to John Gate, for term of his life, with all the Lands, Tenements,
etc. thereto belonging or adjacent, and did also by the same Letters patents
give and grant unto the said John Gate amongst other things, the Lands
belonging to the said new built message, whereof the said Close called Pipers
down was part, for Term of his life, for the exercising of the said office,
with an averment in the plea, that before that time there was no such office of
the keeping of the said house, and that the King did not know, nor was at the
time of the grant informed, that the said Tenement and Lands whereof the said
Close was parcel were Copyhold of the said manor. After the grant made to
John Gate, as aforesaid, H. the 8. dyed seized of the said manor, and of the
reversion of the said Message and Close after the death of John Gate, and
thereby Ed. the 6. became sof^ed of them in like manner, and from Ed. the 6.
they came to Queen Mary. Then John Gate dies, and after his death. Queen Mary
enters upon the said manor and Message whereof the said Close was a parcel,
and afterward by her Letters Patents under her broad Seal, does grant the
Manor and Message and Premises unto Susan Tongue, and her heirs for ever. From
Susan Tongue by mean conveyance, the said Manor Message and Premises, came to
Humphry White and his heirs, and afterterwards Humphrey White being seized
thereof in Fee, did by his indenture of lease demise the said Manor Message
and Premises to Leigh for 60. years, to begin from Mich. before the making of
the indenture, afterward Humphrey White grants away the reversion of the said
Manor Message and Premises to Sir John Branch, afterward Sir John Branch
grants this reversion to Vdall, Vdall grants it to Bathurst, and Bathurst
grants it to Thomas Boothby the Ancestor of Thomas Boothby, whose Baily does
here make the avowry. Afterward Robert Leigh who had the lease of the said
Manor and Premises as aforesaid. for 60 years, devises the residue of this
lease then unexpired, by his last Will and Testament unto Robert Leigh his Son,
and dies, Robert Lee the son being possessed of the residue, or remainder of
this Term for 60. years, by virtue of the said Will did at his court, held for
the said Manor of Chingford, grant the said Message with the appurtenances,
and Lands thereunto belonging, whereof the said Close was parcel, unto Edmund
Lee his brother, to hold of the same Manor in Fee, at the will of the Lord by
Copy of Court Roll of that Manor, Edmund Lee was thereupon admitted
accordingly. Afterward the said lease for 60. years made by Humphrey White
unto Robert Leigh, the Father, expires: Afterward Thomas Boothby, who had the
reversion of the said Manor and Premises as abovesaid, entered as in his
reversion upon the said Manor and Premises, and dyed seized thereof, leaving
issue Thomas Boothby his Son, Thomas Boothby the Son enters into the said
Manor and Premises, and claims the said Message with the apurtenances with
the lands thereunto belonging, whereof the Close called Pipers down was
parcel, (and was granted by Robert Leigh unto Edmund Leigh by Copy of Court
Roll as aforesaid, as parcel of the demaines of the said Manor of Chingford,
and does deny it to be Copyhold, and to the intent to try the title thereof,
did by the Avowant his Bailiff distrein the Cattle in the said Close, as damage
feasant in his soil and Freehold.

This Case was argued first by Arthur Harris of Lincolnes Inn, who argued for
the Plaintiff, viz. he that brought the replevin, and in his argument, he made
the general question in the Case to be whether the close called Pipers Down in
which the distress was taken, were at the time of the distress taken demiseable
by Copy of Court Roll, or whether the Custom was not destroyed, and he held it
was demiseable, and that the custom was not destroyed, and hereupon he made
four questions. 1. Whether the grant of the new house to Sr. John Gate per
nomen officii of keeper thereof were a good grant. 2ly. Whether the King not
being informed at the time of the grant, that the house was Copyhold tenure, he
was not deceived in his grant. 3ly. Whether by this grant the Custom was not
destroyed. 4ly. Whether the Kings Patentee has not the same privilege to grant
this house, etc. again by Copy of Court Roll after the death of Sr. John Gate,
And as to the 1. of these 4. questions, he cited 8 E. 4. by Chock, and 21 E.
4.79. and Mich 5 Car. Banc. Reg. Monsons case, and Pasc. 14 Car. Banc. Reg.
Messand and Butterfields Case, and 5 E. 4. f. 8. and Dyer 269. Savages Case. To
the 2d. question he held, that the King was not here informed of his right, and
consequently he was deceived, and therefore ought not to be prejudiced by his
grant, which he should be if he had not liberty to demise this house again by
Copy of Court Roll, after the death of Sr. John Gate, and he said that there
are two rights in the King, 1. At the Common Law, and 2ly. a customary right,
and of this Customary right, or his jus concedendi he was not informed, and he
cited these books, 3 H. 7.10. rep. 49.8 H. 625 Br. Aid 45 4. H. 6.1, 2 R. 3.

is to supply a matter, which is not so here, 41 E. 3. Fitzh. protest. 9.22 H.

turn to his prejudice, 1 rep. 52.18 H. 8. Lovels. Case, Pasc. 2 Eliz. Sr.
Thomas Mores Case, 1. rep. ^3.16. Jac. Needlers case; and whereas it is said
that the words ex certa scientia in the patent do declare that the King was
informed, I answer, that those words do intend no more but that the King was
informed of matters of fact, and not of matters in Law, and the Kings grant
shall only be taken secundum intentionem; and whereas it may be objected that
by the granting of the Estate for life unto Sr. John Gate, the custom is
destroyed, I answer, that this being in the Case of the King, it is an
extraordinary Case, and not to be measured by ordinary rules of Law. And 2ly.

Eliz. and the patentee of the King shall have the same privilege, that the King
should have had if he had not granted the Letters patents, 27 Eliz. Stubs and
Rigfords case. At another day Arthur Harris spoke again to the point, that the
King had no legal intent to destroy the Copyhold Estate by his patent, and
therefore it should not be destroyed, and cited Grotius de jure belli et pacis,
343. and that no such intent can appear in the words of the patent, and cited
7. rep. Inglefields Case, and 17 E. 3. f. 19. and Cooks Institutes 373. and 1.
rep. 46. and Plow. 333. and as to the last point he argued, that the Patentee
of the King, shall be in the same condition, as to the reviving of the Copyhold
Estate, as the King should have been if he had not made the grant, because that
the King has the Fee, and he may grant it as he pleases, Dyer 16 Eliz. 337.1.
rep. 31.10 Eliz. Dyer 266.24 Ed. 3. Fitz. Tit. guard 27. and no priority can be
pleaded against the King, nor against his Patentee, Hill. 30 Eliz. Stubs and
Rightwayes Case, an Action of Account against Executors does lie only for the
King. It is true that prerogatives inseparable, and annexed to the person of
the King, cannot be granted away by the King, but prerogatives separable may be
granted away 12 H. 4. Fitzh. guard 81. The Grantee of the Grantee of the King
shall have the prerogative of the King, by reason of the thing granted by the
King, Brook praerog. 17. 21 H. 7.2. Br. enter congeable 4^^ The King may
distrein for a rent seck; but not his Grantee, because it is a prerogative
executory, and not executed, for in such case it is otherwise; and as to the
objection to the cause of the demurrer set forth, that the Concessit is not
answered, because it only says mentionat. esse concessum, I hold it well
enough; but if it should not be, yet it is helped, for both parties do agree in
the setting forth of the Letters Patents, 34 Eliz. B. R. in Har^ and Smiths
case, and the grant is confessed in our rejoinder, and though the demurrer
should not be good, yet the Avowant cannot have Judgment, for he has not
entitled himself to the Action as appears by his grant, for his grant is void,
and cannot take effect rep. 46.8. rep. 201.39 Eliz. in the Chequer Chamber.
Where 2. Manours are granted by the name of one of them, the grant is not good.
And in our case Thomas Boothby had nothing in the land at the time of making of
the deed of Covenant to stand seized to use, as it appears by the Avowants own
pleading, and the postea cannot help it, Dyer 111. Clarks Case, Hill. 15 Iac.
entered Trin. 15 Iac. rot. 29. Desmons case, 20 H. 615. Hales on the other side
argued for the Avowant, and prays a return of the Cattle distreyned; first, he
put the Case at large. And he said that the Plaintiff has not well set forth
the Kings grant in his bar, and so it is all one, as if he had not set it forth
at all, Plowd. 563. and he has disputed that which we have not alleged, and
the sur rejoinder is but argumentaive, and not positive, and nothing appears to
the Court, and he has quite mistaken his course and way. But admitting the
case, and the points to be as they are made, viz. 1. Whether the new Office be
well granted, because the word Constituimus is omitted. 2. Whether the grant
for life be good. 3. Whether the grant of the Copyhold for life be a suspension
of the Copyhold estate, or an extinguishment of it, which is the great question
in the Case.

For the 1 point I hold that here is a good grant of this new Office, and that
the word Constituimus is not necessary, because that there are special fees
also newly granted. 2ly. This is not an Office in gross, consisting and resting
upon it self; but it is a relative Office or an employment incident in the
interest of the house granted, and therefore the word. Constituimus is not here
necessary, Dyer 200. 3ly. If it be not a formal Office, yet here is a good
grant of an employment, to which a recompense may be added; although an Assize
cannot be brought for it. 3 Ass. Trin. 6 Iac. Abercromies Case: And here the
protestation that the King was not informed that this was Copyhold land is
unnecessarily alleged, and therefore it is not of necessity it should be
answered; and if it be not well set forth it is not material. For the 2
question whether the King was deceived in his grant, he said that the King
needed not to take notice of any former estates, and that the Statute
expresses, that it is not necessary to recite them, 24 H. 8. 2^ To the 3 point
and the chief question, whether the Copyhold estate be suspended or
extinguished, he held it was extinguished, and cited Knights case, and Alton
woods case, and said, that the rules of the Civil Law ought not to be applied
to the Common Law, nor to be cited to perplex the proceedings thereof, and were
this in the case of a Common person, without doubt the Copyhold estate would be
destroyed, 20 Eliz. by Popham and Fenn, and the King here has the Fee simple,
and there is no difference between the case of the King, and of a Common person
in this regard; a thing which will not pass by the King without notice; will
not pass with notice, and here is no prejudice to the King in not taking notice
whether by the Patent the Custom to grant Copyhold estates be destroyed or not;
and here is a necessary consequence in Law, that the custom is destroyed,
because the King that had the fee in the Manor has suspended the Copyhold by
his grant. All the Arguments used on the other side are to destroy the Kings
grant, and the cases put do all differ from our case, and do stand upon their
own bottoms: Nor shall the King be intended to be mis-conusant of his
particular grant, such as this is, although he may be in a general grant. lib.
Ass. 21. pl. 19. Pasch. 12 Car. C. B. Glover and Edgars case, and it would be a
great mischief if the Copyhold estate should be revived. As to the last point,
whether the Patentee shall be in the same condition as the King was, he said
that it is not material whether he be or no, as to the Case in question, and
rested upon the 3 question. If the King has free, warren in land, and grants
the land, and mentions not the warren, yet the warren passes by the grant: And
here out Avowry stands pro confesso, because the Plaintiff has made no title. A
grant of a Manor per nomen maneriorum is a good grant of the Manor, and here is
a good grant, and if not, yet it is helped by the Statute of 3 and 4 Phil. and
Mar. C. 1. 1 H. 7. f. 28 and the Postea here refers not to the grant of the
Copy, and here is no ouster alleged, and if there be, there is do disseisin,
but it passes an estate for will between the parties. Roll chief Justice, It
would be dangerous to make the Patent void, because the King took no notice of
the Copyhold estate, and this point is not fit to be argued: A thing not
materially alleged in pleading is not necessarily to be answered, and it is not
necessary to create such an Office as this is, for it is but an employment. The
great question is, whether after the death of Sr. John Gate, the Copyhold
estate can be revived or not in the case of the King. It may be dangerous
whether it be one way, or the other. As to the pleading we will not make it
ill, if it may be good. Argue the great point again, for it is a difficult
point, and of great consequence. Ierman Justice to the same effect, and
inclined, that the King had no intent to destroy the Copyhold, and he held that
the Office was well granted, because it was but an employment. Nicholas Justice
inclined, that the Copyhold was destroyed. At another day Wadham Windham argued
for the Plaintiff; and first he put the case at large, and then said, that 1. It
appears by the replication that the Avowant has no title. 2. He confesses
that the Plaintiff has a Title. Queen Mary seized of the Manor of Chingford
Comitis, whereof Pipers Down is parcel, grants it per nomen duorum illorum
maneriorum, and it is not averred that she had two Manors. First, it is
considerable, whether the Patent be good by the Common Law, 2ly. Whether, if
not, yet it be made good by the Statute of H. 8. and he held, 1. That it is not
good at the Common Law, because it is uncertain, and wants sufficient words,
and here is an apparent falsity, for he has two Manors, and he grants but one;
and if the King have two Manors, and grant them per nomen Manerii, this is not
a good grant; As tithes belonging to a Rectory cannot pass by the name of a
portion of tithes, neither do all the Statutes of Confirmation of Patents,
confirm less or greater values granted, than are comprised in the Letters
Patents, 41 Eliz. Pasons case in the Exchequer. A presentation to a Rectory
where it ought to be ad Medietatem Rectoriae is not a good presentation, 2.
rep. Dodingtons Case, Dyer ^31. An ill grant is not helped by the Statute,
because it is not named. 2ly. A false suggestion is not helped by the Statute
of 34 H. 8. 3 Car. Sir Hatton Farmers case, and in our case here is a mistake
of a thing, and not of the name, for it is a Manor for Manors, and so there is
no true meaning, and therefore it cannot be helped by the Statute, Pasch. 1
Iac. rot. 216. C. B. Dawson against Pickering. The Queen was seized of two
Manors, viz. of Rushworth, and of Dale, and granted the Manor of Rushworth,
habendum the Manor of Rushworth, with the Manor of Dale, and it was held an ill
grant at the Common Law, and not helped by the Statute. But it is objected that
this Manor may be known by the name of two Manors, and so in our case, although
the King was seized of one Manor, and granted this Manor habendum per nomen
duorum Maneriorum, this is good, Mich. 22 H. 6. pl. 16. f. 13. To this the
answer is, that it cannot be pleaded per nomen without an averment that there
are two Manors, 2 Ed. 4. f 28. the last case: There is a difference between a
feofment and a release, a feofment may be pleaded per nomen without an
averment; but a release cannot be so pleaded, for in a feofment the livery
operates to pass the land, 22 H. 6. Hill. f. 39. pl. 9.13. and Dyer, the
Sergeants Case; where there is certainty there needs no averment; but it is not
so in our Case 1 H. 7. f. 28. and it is a foreign intendment to suppose that one
Manor of Chingford Comitis shall be known by the name of the two Manors of
Chingford Comitis, and we need not plead by a non concessit, because the
Avowant has made no title, and so he can have no return, 1 H. 7. f. 28. 6 H 7.
f. 6. and here is no certainty added to make it certain by the words illorum
quod nuper perquisivimus de, etc. To the second point, The Avowant has
confessed the Plaintifs title, for he has confessed, that K. H. the 8th. has
made it a Copyhold, and if the Copy be good, our title is good. As to the
question, whether when a Copyhold comes to the King, and he leaseth it, this
does not so destroy the Copyhold, that when the lease is out it may not be
Copyhold again. I hold, that if a Common person lease a Copyhold, the Copyhold
is destroyed; but it is not so where the King leaseth it, as it is in our case,
which ought not to be measured by the Common rule of Law, for the Law of the
Crown overrules the Common Law, and the Law of Custom, 22 E. 3. The King is
not bound by Custom as a common person is, 35 H. 6. The King having Gavelkind
lands may destroy the Custom which runs with such lands pro tempore only, and
the Kings grant shall not enure to a secondary operation, as Knights case is;
and here is no prejudice to any person that the Copyhold estate should be
revived, here the consequence may be severed, and it is not necessary; and
therefore the lease of the Copyhold, not naming it Copyhold, is good. As to the
Objection made, that it is no benefit to the King to make it Copyhold again;
the answer is, That it is a prejudice to take away a man's privilege and
liberty, if there were no other inconvenience; but here is more, for there may
be prejudice by losing the Common, etc. And the rule, that a Custom is an
entire thing and cannot be apportioned, shall not bind the King, although it do
bind common persons, and the Statute makes not the grant good as to the
reversion. The Copyhold is demised, and yet shall be demisable hereafter, and
so it may be pleaded, for pleading follows the Law: A Custom interrupted in the
right is gone for ever; but if it be interrupted but in part, it is not so, as
it is in the case cited, where the King has Gavelkind lands, Com. Plowd. 114.
and so prays judgment for the Plaintiff. Adjourned. Latch at another day argued
for the Avowant, and said, that the Plaintiff in his rejoinder has made no
title unto Susan Tongue, from whom he claims. It is objected, that by the grant
of the Manor of Chingford Comitis per nomen duorum illorum maneriorum, etc.
that Tongue cannot be entitled. It is answered that the other side has
confessed, that Tongue has a title, for they derive from her also, and the
contrary does not appear to the Court, and it being agreed, the Court will not
make a doubt of it. He made 3 Questions, 1. Whether the Manor of Chingford
Comitis passes per nomen duorum illorum maneriorum de, etc. 2ly. Whether if
the grant be ill it be aided by Statute. 3ly. Whether it be helped by the
Averment. For the 1. he held, that here is a good grant, without any averment
or aid of the Statute; for if the King grants two Manors one shall pass, and e
converso, it shall not be so in the Case of the King, but it is good in the
case of a Common person with an Averment. The grant of the Manor of Saperton
cum Rippen is an ill grant for the incertainty of it; but here is no such
incertainty, here is no non nosmer of the thing, for the word nomina requires
not a proper name; but it is all one, as if it had been expressed by words
comprehending it, and the word Manors does comprehend it. If the King grant his
two Acres of Land lying in a Common field, although but one Acre is to be
found, yet the grant is good, and it is not like to the grant of a Manor with
the Advowson, where the King has but a moiety of the Advowson, or a moiety of
the Manor, for the Moiety is not actual in the whole, but one is actually in
two, and so it is well named here. 2ly. Whether it be good, without an averment
that the land was in the Lord Darcy, and he held it was. If the words were
general in the grant, all of them ought to be true, otherwise nothing will
pass by the grant, as Dodingtons case is; but here is a proper name to express
it, and therefore the grant is not destroyed, although the latter description
do not agree to it, 10. Rep. Harpers Case. 2 H. 4. f. 2. If the King grant all
the lands in the Patent annexed, bearing date 10 of June, though the Patent
bear date the 10 of July, yet is the grant good; for veritas nominis tollit
errorem demonstrationis; and if the grant should not be good at the Common Law,
yet it is aided by the Statute of 3. and 4 Phil. and Mar. and here is a full
and a strong averment in the pleading, for it is Manerium praedictum, and not
Manerium generally, and here is not only a possibility, but also a facility for
it to pass, and it may be called Manor, or Manors; and in a feofment a thing
may pass per nomen, because that the livery passes it, where one pleads per
nomen he is to make the Plea agree with the Record or specialty, otherwise per
nomen shall not be pleaded, and Newtons opinion against this is but a single
opinion, 33 H. 8. Br. Averment 42. The word praedict. makes an averment in the
name of the Feoffor, ^4 H. 4.30.22. H. 6.40. Barton and Escott, and here is
also a full averment of the thing granted, and this is in grants, 7 E. 4.24.33
H. 6. f. 22, 26 Ass. 2.24 Ass. 6. so in Letters Patents, Dyer 86. the Sergeants
case, and if this be authority it is in the very point, Dyer 207. praedict. per
nomina is a good averment, Pasch. 7. Iac. Rot. 430. B. reg. Stonehouse and
Reeds case, where there was not so much as a per nomina, but only decimas
praedict, and yet adjudged to be a good intitling, by the word praedict,
because it was held a good averment, although it was not led on by a per
nomina, and there admitted to be clear if it had been with a per nomina, as the
Case here is, and so Tongue is well entitled. 2ly. The Plaintifs title is well
avoided, and we have well destroyed his Copy; without doubt if a Common person
had granted the Copyhold for life, the Copyhold had been thereby extinguished,
and our case is not a prerogative case, for the King is bound by the Custom of
the Manor, and the Custom is here destroyed, and the prerogative cannot create
the Custom anew, and it is against the Kings Prerogative to have things drawn
out of the King, without matter of Record; and it is prejudice to the King to
have the Custom revived, for the lands are now made free, and shall never
return again to the Vassalage. The Kings Prerogative exalts him above a Common
person, but this custom makes him equal to a common person, 2ly. The Custom
here cannot be supported; but here is an absolute extinguishment of the
Copyhold, so that it cannot be regranted. The law will confirm things necessary
to the grant of the King in some cases where it is prejudicial to the King, 16
H. 7. f. 8. Nicholas case Plowd. 489. The king seized of a donative makes it
presentative, if he do but once present unto it, so if he turn an Annuity into
a rent charge by taking a distress: And the nature of this Custom here ought
not to be examined with other Customs, for it is more strict than in other
cases, for if it be once destroyed, it is always destroyed, and cannot be
suspended, and it is not for the Kings dis-advantage to have the Copyhold
destroyed; but it is for his advantage and convenience, and so he prays
judgment for the Avowant. Roll chief Justice. All will come and rest upon the
last point, for all the other things are admitted: The grant is good by the per
nomen, and it is only nominal, and does not imply that there are two Manors,
and it may stand well enough with reason that it may be known per nomen: But
the last point is considerable; he inclined to Latch. Nicholas Justice to the
same effect, and that the praedict is a good averment. The last point is
considerable, but prima facie, here the custom is not destroyed. Ask Justice to
the same effect, and that it appears that the King intended to grant but one
Manor. Roll, We will take time till the next term to speak to the last point,
which is only doubtful, and to deliver our opinions. Ierman Justice, the
pleading of the party per nomen helps not the Patent, if it be not good in it
self. The next Term Roll chief Justice for himself and the rest of the Judges,
who he said concurred in opinion with him, delivered the opinion of the Court
to this effect. 1. That they were agreed that the grant of the Office of the
Custody of the house is a good lease for life, notwithstanding it was Copyhold,
and it is not necessary to recite in the grant that it is Copyhold. 2. That
after the estate for life is determined, the King may grant the house and land
again by Copy of Court Roll, because the Kings grants shall be taken
favorably, and not extended to two intents, where there is no necessity for
it, as there is not here, and we are not here to intend a collateral intent,
and so the Copyhold is not destroyed; for the Law takes care to preserve the
inheritance of the King for his Successors, and it may be a benefit to the King
to have it continue Copyhold, viz. to have Common, etc. and his election is
also destroyed, if he may not have it Copyhold. So Judgment was given for the
Plaintiff, nisi.

IN this Case formerly argued, Roll chief Justice, Judgment reversed upon a

and Nicholas and Ask Justices agreed, that the devise of the Copyhold here is
a devise to the Heirs of the Father, and so a Fee-simple, and that the party
comes not in as a purchaser, and for this cause the judgment was reversed,
nisi. As to the other point, whether the surrender of a Copyhold by a Tenant
for life be good in this case, the Court delivered no opinion, Antea.

THis Case formerly spoken in was moved again, and Latch held, Whether a good

that the words obtulit se in maritagium conjungi, was a good notice upon the
whole matter, and therefore that the Action did well lie. Roll chief Justice
answered, this is a personal thing, and ought to be offered to the party
himself, otherwise it is no notice, and that does not appear here, and if there
be no notice employed, then the Action lies not; and Holmes and Twists case is,
that there ought to be notice if the thing be to be done by the party himself,
otherwise if it be to be done by a stranger, so is it here; but the question
only is, if notice be employed here or not? Ierman Justice said, there is no
tender of marriage if the other party be not there. The rule was for the
Plaintiff to take his Judgment.

Rooke against Smith.
Pasch. 1651. Banc. sup.
ROoke brought an Action upon the case against Smith for speaking these words
of him, Thou art a poor fellow, Arrest of Judgment in an Action upon the Case
for words.
and art not able to pay 2s. in the pound, and art not able to pay thy debts.
Upon an Issue joined, and a Verdict for the Plaintiff, the Defendant moved in
Arrest of Judgment, that the words are not actionable; for 1. the Plaintiff is
not by them charged with the crime of being a Bankrupt, and so there is no
particular loss to him. 2ly. It is not showed that the Plaintiff got his
living by buying and selling, or that he is indebted, and 11. Iac. Brook and
Clarks case, was cited. Twisden on the other side answered, that the Plaintiffs
credit was impaired by the words, and by his credit his livelihood is in part
mainteyned. And he cited Viccary and Barns case. Adjourned to the next Term.
Wild afterward moved again for Judgment, because the words being spoken of a
tradesman, he conceived them to be actionable. Maynard on the other side held
them not actionable, because there is no particular damage alleged to grow to
the Plaintiff by speaking of them, and because there is no crime objected
against the Plaintiff; for poverty is no crime; but a man may be poor and
honest at the same time, and he cited two cases to be adjudged, that a
particular damage ought to be alleged. And said that these Actions are not
favored in Law, and therefore if the words be not clearly Actionable, it was
not reason to make a forced construction of them to make them so. Next the
Plaintiff has not averred, that he was able to pay all his debts for all the
things bought; but only of a debt contracted by the buying of the Oil
mentioned. Twisden denied the cases put by Maynard of the particular damage,
and held the words actionable. Roll chief Justice said, a man may be a
Bankrupt, and yet be honest, for he may become so by accident, Averment.
and not of purpose to deceive his creditors. But here is no need for the
Plaintiff to show he had a particular loss by the words, for it is enough that
he is generally scandalized by them, neither is it necessary for him to averr,
that he was able to pay all his debts as Maynard has alleged, Therefore let
the Plaintiff have his Judgment nisi. Antea.

Judgment urged that the words are not actionable, because there is no special
loss or damage alleged by the Plaintiff happening to her by reason of the
words, and said that in one Lighfoot and Pigots case it had been ruled that an
Action lies not for saying a woman had a Bastard, and he cited also Winter and
Barnards case, Trin. 1650. in this Court. Upon these reasons Judgment was
stayed till the other side should move.

was again spoken unto by Latch, wherein he made this question, viz. whether
the limitation to I. and his Heirs were good or not? and he held it was not
good; for he said that such limitation in case of a freehold is void. He
confessed that in the case of Pell and Brown 17 Iac. rot. 44. the contrary was
adjudged; but that there did appear such apparent inconvenience in it, that
upon it the Court was afterward divided, and 21 Iac. in the Sergeants case it
was made a flat quaere, and ever since it has been disputable, whether a
contingent devise be good or not, and in Jacob and Tellings case it is not
determined, and Hanbury and Cookrells case is not adjudged; but if it be, it is
on my side, and Mich. 37 and 38. C. B. rot. 1149. It was adjudged upon solemn
argument at the Bar, and on the Bench, contrary to the Judgment in Pell and
Browns case, if lands be devised to one and his Heirs, and if he dye without
issue, that the land shall be to another, and his Heirs, this is no Estate
tail; for it cannot stand with the rules of Law to devise ^uth an Estate, for
it is but a possibility, and if it should be more, it must be a Fee upon a Fee,
and so a perpetuity, and it cannot be known within what bounds it shall end,
either in case of years, or life, or other contingencies, and the comparison of
Lampets case is not like to this case, for that was or a Term, but this is of a
freehold, and a contingent devise of a freehold is not good since the Statute
of 32 H. 8. and Brook tit. devise, 2 Dyer, 28 H. 8. f. 3^. is not an opinion
against this. And though there could be such a devise of other lands, yet
Copyhold lands cannot be so devised as the case is here, for there cannot be so
much as a possibility of reverter, for there is no custom to warrant it, Hill.
5. Car. King and Leyden in this Court, and Dyer 264. and though there might be
a reverter; yet he cannot devise it by will, and if he could, yet here the
conbeyance is made up by surrender, admittance, and devise, and the party is
here in by the surrender, and not by the devise; and so is a Copyholder in by
Act executed, and not upon the contingency, and the will is but to direct; and
though all this be otherwise, yet the Plaintiff cannot have Judgment, for it
appears not that the surrender is presented at any Court at all, and here is
nothing but a recital found. Ierman Justice said by the Common Law there ought
to be a presentment at the next Court. Roll chief Justice, and Nicholas
Justice. There is no certain time for the presentment; but it is according to
the Custom of the Manor, so that it be within the life of the Tenant. Roll
chief Justice said, it is an inconvenience to devise such a contingent Estate.
Nicholas doubted, for he said it would shake many wills, if it might not be,
and so said Hales. The Court would advise. Hales confessed the verdict was
imperfect, but prayed it might be amended; But Latch answered it is good enough
for us the Defendants, for we have primer possession. The Court answered it
would be good to have it amended, and not to have a venire de novo, Venire.
for that will be chargeable; but if the verdict be imperfect to bring the
matter in Law into question, we can grant a new venire, although it has been
heretofore doubted. Therefore be advised, so that it may be argued. Antea.

THe case between Heal and Green upon a special verdict formerly argued by

and he held that the Feme had power by the Will to make the lease,
notwithstanding that she has but an Estate for life, and cited 11 Car. B. R.
Hill. rot. 810. Job and Whites case, and 21 Iac. Danyel and Vgnel, and he said
that the remainder limited to the daughter does not hurt, for it may very well
stand with the will, and the intent of the Testator appears upon the whole to
be to give such a power to his wife to make this lease, and cited 8 Car. Perd
and Bensams case. And there is a clause in the will that shows that the
Testator did intend to advance his wife by this devise. And the Feme shall be
in by the power, which shall make the estate of the lease good, and it is not
necessary to recite the power, as it is held in Rogers case. Maynard on the
other side said, he would not dispute the power; but here is no such power
given to the wife as it appears by the express words of the Will, which does
only describe that she shall only make Estates but for her life, otherwise she
might make Estates in Tail, or in Fee, and if this should be the last part of
the Will, which does limit, the remainder would be destroyed, and generals in a
Will shall not revoke an express devise; but they ought so to be construed that
all the Will may stand together, as Bonhams case is 8. rep. Roll chief Justice,
It is a difficult thing to show the meaning of the Testator here, but the
general must not destroy the particular devise to which Nicholas Justice
assented, and Roll enclyned that the Feme had power by the Will to make this
Estate, otherwise the words of the Will must be idle, and void, and it may be
the Baron intended to give his wife such a power, that she might destroy the
remainders, and otherwise there cannot be any construction made of the Will.
Ask Justice differed in opinion, and said it was unreasonable the remainder
should be destroyed, which is expressly limited by the Will, and a Will does
differ from a conveyance Nicholas Justice said, that the words shall be
expounded to show his bounty to his wife; but not to give her power to destroy
the remainder. Ierman Justice, There are express words, for the Feme, and the
daughter and the Feme has a power; but not to destroy the Estate of the
daughter. Curia advisare vult. Antea.

Upon a special verdict upon these words, Argument and judgment upon special
verdict, the question whether dower well assi^g^ed or not.
viz. I do endow you of a third part of all the lands my Cosen I. S. your
husband dyed seized of. The question was whether the feme were well endowed by
these words, because he does not say that he endows her by metes and bounds,
Chase held she was not well endowed, and cited 8 Ed. 2.15. and said that here
is incertainty which begets dissension, which ought not to be, and the thing is
not here entire; but may be divided. And this is an assignment of dower, which
differs from a demand of dower, for a demand may be general as in the cases of
Thyn and Thyn in this Court, and of Fairefax and Fairefax, and so the book of 8
E. 2. entry congeable (S) 5. which seems to prove the contrary, that is not to
our case, for it differs from it. Merifield of Council on the other side held
the feme was well endowed, and agreed the cases put by Chase. That of Common
right a feme ought to be endowed by metes and bounds, yet sometimes it is
otherwise, as 3 Eliz. Dyer 27. a feme endowed in Common. And the feme that is
to be endowed, and the pacty who is to assign the dower, may agree that the
dower shall be assigned without bounding it. For consensus tollit errorem; But
dower ad ostium ecclesiae must be more certain, Dower.
Mich. 43, and 44 Eliz. Bullock and Finches case, Hill. 4 Iac. C. B. Roll chief
Justice, Of Common right a feme ought to be endowed per metas and bundas, where
the Sheriff assigns dower, who is an officer of the Law, and ought to prevent
encumbrance, and disputes; But it may be assigned generally of the third part
in some cases, Consent.
and the parties may agree against Common right, and here both parties agreed
to take dower in this Manor. And though here the termer for years of the land
who is a third person, be prejudiced by this assignment, yet this alters not
the case, because it is only an estate for years, and touches no freehold.
Nicholas and Ask Justices as Roll. Ierman Justice, If dower be of a third part,
it ought to be by metes and bounds generally; but if it be of a moiety it is
not so, or if the parties consent it shall be otherwise. Roll if the Sheriff
assign dower and do it not per metas and bundas it is Error, Error.
if it might have been so assigned, and where a feme cannot be endowed per

Exception, viz. That there is no time nor place set forth where or when he did
forbear to sue the Defendant, as it ought to be, because it is a traversable

Hill. 1649. rot. 758.
IN an Action of Trespass and Ejectment upon a special verdict found. The Case
fell out to be this. Special Verdict in Trespass and Ejectment.
A man by his last Will and Testament devised all his Fee simple land
wheresoever to his Brother, upon condition that he suffer his wife to enjoy all
his free lands in Holford during her life; and the jury found that the Testator
had only a portion of tithes in Holford: The question was, whether the portion
of tithes did pass to the wife by this devise. Merifield held, That the Tithes
passed not by the devise, because the word lands cannot extend to tithes, for
that would be a very forced construction, and cited Trin. 17 Iac. Banc. Reg.
Knight and Knights case, and Mich. 39 and 40 Eliz. Entered 38 Eliz. rot. 269.

lands, and he said, that the word wheresoever makes no difference, as to make
the tithes pass; and though there be an implication and an intent in the
Testator here to dedevise the tithes, yet that will not serve, because there
wants words to express this intent, and though this be in a will, yet there
must be words used to support the intent of the Testator, for wills must be
ruled by the rules of the Common Law. Ashinghurst and Curtice his case, Mich. 7
Iac. Hob. rep. 34. the last Edition. Mich. 42 and 43 Eliz. Banc. Reg. a devise

B. Reg. Sherwood and Winston held, that tithes cannot be appendant to a Manor,
1 Rep. 111. Albanies case, and here are no words in the Proviso to pass the
tithes. It is true that tithes may lie in tenure, and that an Action of debt
lies for them, but that is by the Statute 19 Eliz Dyer f. 354. The word land in
a will does not extend to tithes, and heirs ought not to be dis-inherited by
doubtful and ambiguous words, as it must be here, if these tithes should pass.
Next, as to the verdict, he said, that it is not thereby found that the
Testator died possessed of the tithes, as it ought to have been, as it has
been adjudged 43 Eliz. and so he prayed judgment for the Plaintiff. Maynard of
Counsel with the Defendant argued, That the tithes did pass by the Will,
otherwise part of the Will must be void, which ought not to be, if all parts
may be so construed that they may stand together, and he agreed that lands and
tithes are distinct things; but in Wills it is not to be so much considered
whether the words of them be proper, but what was the intent of the Testator in
them, and whether they do declare his meaning or not; and here by construction
of the words by freelands inheritance is meant in opposition to Copyhold lands,
or terms for years. 2ly. Here is a positive assertion of the Testator himself,
that in his understanding he had free lands in Holford, for he had no other
lands there, 35 Eliz. Robinsons case, rot. 504. Banc. Reg. by a will things of
one nature may pass by words which are proper to pass things of another nature,

expressed in the Will, and so prayed Judgment for the Defendant. Verdict.
Roll chief Justice asked what he said to the exception, that it is not found
that the Testator dyed seized of the tithes, without doubt it had been ill upon
a Demurrer, therefore see if you cannot help it by the notes by which the
Verdict was drawn up. But for the matter in Law, me thinks it is a strong case
that the tithes do pass, for we are in the case of a Will, where the meaning of
the party shall be observed, if it may be found out by any means, though it
cannot be collected ex vi Terminis, and should it not be so here, part of the
Will would be void, which may not be, if we can make it otherwise by a
reasonable construction. But I will consider of the Verdict, and do you consult
with your notes. Ierman Justice, The Verdict ought to find the dying seized,
and till I am satisfied from the Notes I will deliver no opinion. Nicholas
Justice held both the devise good, and the Verdict also, but said it had been
otherwise upon a Demurrer. Demurrer.
Ask Justice to the same intent. Ierman Justice, It is clear that the Testator
intended to devise the lands in Holford, and it is a good devise, but if the
Verdict be imperfect it is for the Plaintiff, but if otherwise it is for the
Defendant. The Court would advise touching the Verdict.

SHann brought an Action upon the Case upon a promise against Bilby, Arrest
(...) Judgment in an Action upon the Case upon a promise.
and declares, that in consideration that the Plaintiff should surrender a
Copyhold unto I. S. and his heirs, according to the Custom of the Manor, the
Defendant did assume and promise to pay unto him 100 l. and that he did
surrender the Copyhold into the hands of a Customary Tenant of the Manor,
according to the Custom of the Manor, to the use of I. S. and his heirs, and
that the Defendant had not paid the hundred pound according to his promise, and
declares to his damage, etc. Upon non Assumpsit pleaded, and Issue thereupon
joined, a Verdict was found for the Plaintiff. It was moved in Arrest of
Judgment by Latch of Council with the Defendant, that the Declaration is not
good. 1. Because it does not set forth to whom the promise was made, and if it
do not appear to be made to the Plaintiff, it is nudum pactum, for the promise
here is the consideration. 2ly. The Consideration is Executory, and the
Plaintiff does not show that he has performed it, and then he has no cause of
Action; The Consideration was, that the Plaintiff should surrender a Copyhold to
I. S. and his heirs, according to the custom of the Manor; and he only shows
that he did surrender the Copyhold into the hands of a Customary Tenant,
according to the Custom of the Manor, to the use of I. S. and his heirs, and
does not show that this surrender was presented at the next Court, and so it
appears not to be a good surrender, Surrender.
for it is uncertain whether it shall be presented or no, and till it be
presented it is imperfect: To which the Court assented, and ruled against the
Plaintiff a Nil capiat per Billam, nisi, ^ c. In this case it was said that if a
man covenant to convey lands, Covenant.
it ought to be done at the charge of him that covenanteth to do it, except the
contrary be agreed; Consideration.
And that if there be a double consideration alleged for a promise, if one of
them be good, and the other be not, yet an action will lie upon the promise
that is broken, which was grounded upon these consisiderations.

that there was no Capias taken out against the principal, and therefore the

Kerman against Johnson.

Trin. 1649. rot. 153.
KErman brought an Action of Trespass and Ejectment against Johnson, Special
verdict in Trespass and Ejectment.
and upon a special Verdict found the Case was this. A man devised to I. S. his
whole estate, paying his debts and Legacies, and dies possessed of Goods and
Chattels, to the value of five pounds only, and dyed also seized in fee of
diverse lands, and was indebted forty pounds at the time of his death. The
question was, whether the lands passed by the Devise? Barry of Council with the
Plaintiff argued, that the lands did pass, because that wills ought to receive a
favorable construction; And 2ly. The intent of the Testator is to be
considered, who by the words all his estate, did mean to comprehend as well his
land as his goods and chattels, for there is no restraint of the words here, 7
Ed. 3.10. The word estate is a word of large extent, and extends as well to the
real as personal estate, if it were in Case of grant. much more in the case of
a Will. And there is another word used here to explain the Testators meaning to
be to devise his lands as well as his goods, and that is the word All, which
comprehends all manner of estates, without exception. Next if the land should
not pass, his debts and Legacies cannot be paid, according to the express
intent of the Testator, and the intent of the party ought to be satisfied,
although the words be not proper, because it is in a will, though it might be
other wise in a grant. And whereas it is objected that the Iuries finding of
the value of the debts and Legacies, is to no purpose, because the will cannot
be helped by the averment of the Jury. I answer that averments if they stand
with the will, may be received to make the Testators intent to appear. But
besides this is not an averment only, but a true stating of the Case, to the
intent to find out the Testators meaning. 3ly. The devisee of the land is not
made Executor, but Trustee, or Devisee, and this is since the Statute of
Devises 32 H. 8. The 2. question is, what estate the Devisee has in the lands?
and I conceive he has Fee. simple, because he has all the Estate, which must
be the largest, and that is Fee-simple. Hob. rep. pl. 280. The word whole goes
both to the quantity and quality of an estate also. And here the consideration
that he is to pay all his Debts and Legacies, is a good consideration to pass
the fee-simple of his lands, and though there may be a surplusage after the
Debts and Legacies paid, this hinders nothing; for it is his intent that the
Devisee shall have that surplusage, and so he prayed Judgment for the
Plaintiff. Twisden for the Defendant argued, that either nothing passes by the
Will, or if any thing, then only an estate for life passes. He agreed that
improper words may sometimes pais things, yet sometimes proper words will not
pass things; viz. if the intent of the party appear to be contrary, 24 Eliz,
in the Earl of Northumberlands case. A Devise of all his Jewels, did not pass
his Collar of Esses, and his Jewels annexed to his Parliament Robes, and the
words here are not that he devises all his estate in his lands, but his whole
estate generally, and if the words here should pass the lands, yet the fee
simple passes not, but only an estate for life in the lands, which do pass;
nor do the words paying his Debts and Legacies cause the Fee-simple to pass,
for here is no likelihood of any loss to the Executor; for the words are not,
that he shall pay all his Debts and Legacies; and if he be an Executor, as the
contrary appears not, he shall not be charged with more than the personal
estate will discharge. The words do amount to a Condition, and it is not found
that there are any Debts or Legacies paid, and so it is not performed, and the
heir may well enter into the lands in question, for the Condition broken. 2ly.
The Verdict does not find how the lands are held, whether in Socage, or by
Knights service; and so it appears not whether they can be devised or no, and
they shall not be intended to be Socage lands, Dyer, f. 207. Hill. 32 El. rot.
2. and Pell and Browns case. 3ly. It is not found that the Testator dyed seized
of the lands, as it ought to have been, and he prayed Judgment for the
Defendant. Special Verdict.
Roll. chief Justice to the second Exception to the Verdict answered, that in a
Special verdict it is not necessary to find whether lands be held in Sorage, or
by Knights Service, and he said that the words in the Will do go to the nature
and extent of the estate, as Barry urged, and he doubted how the verdict shall
supply the Will if it be defective, for that is only to make the intent of the
Will certain. Adjourned to be argued again. Postea.

the judgment, which was entered thus, Ideo consideratum est quod recuperet, and
the word Capiatur was omitted, which ought not to be, because the Action is a
Trespass vi et armis. Roll chief Justice said, It is an ill course they use in
the Common Pleas, to enter the judgment so in this Action, Judgment.
for by this course the Plaintiff shall gain his possession of the land, and the
Defendant cannot bring his writ of Error until the writ of Enquiry returned,

seisin, or not? 2ly. Whether the letter of Attorney was good or no, in regard
it had false latin in it, for the letter of Attorney was made by two, and the
words of it are pro me, and in nomine meo to make livery which are words of the
singular number, whereas they ought to be of the plural? Hales as to the 2d.
question held the letter of Attorney good enough, because the authority given
to the Attorney proceeds from both the Feoffors, and therefore the words shall
be intended to be the words of both of them, as spoken by them severally. And
he also argued that the letter of Attorney was well executed to both the
Feoffees, because it was by deed, and he cited 15 E. 4 f. 18. and he said, if
the livery had been made by the Feoffor himself it had been good without
question, and there is no difference, between that and our case, because it is
made according to the effect of the deed, and the Feoffee who is present is
Attorney for the Feoffee that is absent to receive livery for him, and the
effect of the letter of Attorney is executed, although the words are not, Cooks
Lit. f. 5. and Hoxon and Polts case, in the Exchequer, 34 Eliz. Boltons case,
Livery made to the husband, was held a good Livery to the wife also. Latch of
Council on the other side made two questions. 1. Whether here was a good
authority? 2ly. Whether it was well executed? For the first he argued, that
here was no authority given to the Attorney to enter into the lands in the name
of both the Feoffors, for the words are that he should enter in nomine meo,
which cannot comprehend both of them, the words being in the singular number,
and he agreed that Livery made by the Feoffor himself to one, in the name of
both had been good; but here the livery is by Attorney, and an Attorney has
nothing but a bare authority given him, which ought to be strictly pursued,
especially it being to pass away an Estate. He also took exceptions to the
special verdict, and said that the trial upon which the verdict was found, was
directed out of the Chancery to discover a fraud, and the verdict finds nothing
according to the direction, and so it ought to be set a side, besides the
verdict in it self is uncertain, for it is of 300 Acres of land generally,
which is uncertain, and so the Plaintiff can have no Judgment, for the
Declaration warrants not the verdict, for the Declaration mentions Houses, and
Cottages, besides the 300 Acres of land. 2ly. The verdict does not find the
date of the Indenture, and the Title to the land is to commence a die datus.
Hales answered 1. It shall be intended the day of the date. 2ly. It shall take
effect after the delivery, if there be no day of the date expressed. And to
that exception to the verdict, that there are not so many Acres contained in
it, as are expressed in the Declaration; he answered that the Judgment shall
go to all which is land in kind only, and shall not extend to Houses, and
Cottages, and there appears to be a residuum, or surplusage. Verdict.
Roll chief Justice said, that it is uncertain by the verdict what lands are
meant, for there are 400 Acres of land, and four messuages, and four Cottages,
and 40 Acres of meadow in the Declaration, and so there appears to be a
residuum, besides the land found in the verdict, which makes it to be uncertain
what is found. And though it should be a verdict for part, and be uncertain for
the rest, although the Plaintiff will relinquish his damages for the rest, this
will not help it, for there must be two Judgments, and the verdict is ill as
to that which is found, yet he held that it might be good without relinquishing
the damages at all, because the verdict is good for so many Acres as are in the
Declaration, and it shall be intended that the Jury mistook the number of the
Acres, and intended by the verdict no more than the arrable land. Ierman and
Nicholas Justices doubted whether there be a verdict at all, because the Jury
have not found the things contained in the Declaration. Roll chief Justice, and
Nicholas, mutate opinione, held the verdict good; but said it would have been
otherwise upon a demurrer, and it was said that if one declare for 40 l. and
the verdict finds 100 l. the Plaintiff may relinquish 60 l. and have Judgment
for the rest. Ask Justice said that his opinion was, that the verdict is
uncertain, and conceives that the Jury intended all in the Declaration. The
Court took time to advise. Afterward Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

upon a surmise that they did proceed in the Court of equity at Chester
touching the payment of rent reserved upon a lease for years, which is a matter
tryable at the Common Law, and not in a Court of equity. The Court answered we
will see the Bill, whether there be any matter of equity laid in it or no, for
if there be we will not grant a prohibition, and let us also see some
presidents if there be any, for granting of a prohibition in such cases. Powis
who moved for the prohibition replied, That in Chester they hold two Courts,
one for matters of Common Law, and another for matters of equity, and so they
ought to observe the due proceedings in each Court, according to the nature of
the cause, 2ly. This Court of the upper Bench is the superintendent Court over
all other Courts, and a writ of Error lies out of this Court to Chester, and by
consequence a prohibition also to restrain the Court of equity there, if they
shall proceed irregularly. 3ly. There would otherwise be a faller of justice,
for the Court of Chancery here cannot grant a prohibition, because the matter
they proceed in there is no matter of equity, Not. brev. f. 44 H. I. Cook rep.

Justice that it will not lie de brevi ordinario; but in Wales it will ly, Hales

will lie in all places. Roll chief Justice said that Chester has a Court of
upper Bench, and they may grant a prohibition there, and it appears not to us
whether they will grant it or not, Prohibition.
so that we know not whether we need to intermedle. Hales replied, that every
one is bound by the Common Law, and therefore writs mandatoryly at the Common
Law, which generally concern men as subjects, and not concerning private
things. And 1. It is to be considered that Chesters jurisdiction is derived
from this Court, and so it is supposed to be subordinate to it, and is to be
regulated by it. 2ly. When the matter concerns common right, it is not affixed
to Chester, because it concerns men as subjects at large, 20 Iac. Grigs case,

demanded, can we grant a prohibition to the Court of equity in Ireland?
Prohibition.
If there did appear to be any failer of justice here, we would grant a
prohibition; but there appears not any failer, for it may be the party may have
a prohibition in the upper Bench there. Therefore it is good for us to hear the
other party, and in the mean time we will advise, and then let us see the bill

Style against Tullye.
Trin. 1651, Banc. sup.
Hill. 24. Car. rot. 587.
SIr Humphrey Style brought a writ of Error to reverse a Judgment given
against him in an Action of debt upon an obligation in the Common pleas for
Tullye and Acton Executors of the last Will and Testament of one William
Tullye. Error to reverse a Judgment in debt upon an obligation.
The case was this, Sir Humphrey Style, and one Thomas Brook were jointly and
severally bound unto William Tullye, in an obligation of 120 l. for the payment
of 60 l. at a certain day. After the day of payment, and the money not paid,
Thomas Brook makes his Will, and makes Mary Brook his wife his Executrix, and
dies, afterward William Tullye makes his will, and makes Tullye and Acton the
Defendants in the writ of Error his Executors, and dies, and by his will he
releases unto Mary Brook all the debts, which Thomas Brook her husband, did owe
unto him at the time of his death. Tullye and Acton prove this will, and after
bring an Action of debt against Sir Humphrey Style in the Common pleas, upon
the obligation of 160 l. Sir Humphrey Style demurs to the Declaration, and for
cause shows that William Tullye by his will, had released the Debt to Mary
Brooks, and upon this demurrer Judgment was given against Sir Humphrey Style,
and thereupon he brings his writ of Error; wherein the question was, whether
the debt was released by the will or no? Latch of Council for Sir Humphrey
Style argued, that here was an actual release, and he cited 21 E. 4. f. 8. and
a case Trin. 10. Car. and said that a will amounts to a release, although it be
not made of incorporeal things, and the assent of Mary the Executor is not
necessary here, for this is not like the assent to the accepting of a Legacy,
and a debt due upon an Obligation made to the Testator, is not assets in the
hands of an Executor, until it be recovered, and this is more than in the
nature of a Legacy, and here was a great personal Estate, and no other
creditors are deceived by this release, and a devaslavit cannot be here
supposed, 19 H. 8. Dyer 8 E. 4. f. 5. Dyer 139, Cranmers Case, and here is only
an exoneration of a thing, and no donation of any thing by this release,
Sergeant Hen. Clark of Council on the other side argued, that the debt was not
discharged by the will, because this release made by the will cannot take
effect till after the death of the Testator, and so not at all; and such a
release was revokeable by the Testator during his life, and therefore it cannot
be said that it was ever an absolute release; But if this release had been in
the realty, it might peradventure have been otherwise; but it is not so here;
for the debt now rests in the Executor, and it is a devastavit in the Executor
to release it, for this is but a Legacy, and it may be there are debts owing,
which are to be paid before Legacies, and here does not appear to be any assets
in the Executors hands, besides this debt, and if the Testator would have
released it, he ought to have done it by a deed. Roll chief Justice, What shall
the Executor do in this case? I conceive it is a strong case for the Executor;
and that it is very unreasonable that the Testator should make such a devise,
and here is no consent of Mary the Executor expressed to this release, besides
a will cannot release a thing created by deed, and so discharge Creditors.
Nicholas and Ask Justices concurred; But Ierman Justice doubted. For a fault in
the writ of Error, and imperfection in the record certifyed, the Judgment was
not then affirmed. Afterward Sir Humphrey Style preferred his bill in Chancery
to be releived herein, and obtained an injunction till hearing; but upon a
hearing at the Rolls could get no relief; but was ordered to pay 100 l. or else
the injunction to be dissolved. Q. Nota.

AN Action of debt was brought against the Defendant, Error to reverse a

upon an insimul Computaverunt, and a verdict and a Judgment given against
him, whereupon he brought his writ of Error, and assigns for Error, that the
Action was brought against him for rent as a Tenant of land, and not as a
receiver, and that therefore an account did not lie. Roll chief Justice cited
20 H. 6. that rent alone lies not in account, because rent is a certain thing,
and it is also in the realty; but if rent be mixed with other things an account
will lie; Account.
but here it appears the Action is brought against the Defendant as a receiver,
and if one receive money due to me upon an obligation, I shall have either an
Action of account, Debt.
or an Action of debt against him, so if he receive my rents without my
consent. Therefore let the Judgment be affirmed.

AN Action of debt was brought against an Heir, who pleads riens per descent,

and Judgment was given against him upon a nihil dicit, and a writ of enquiry
was awarded without the prayer of the party, and a special Judgment thereupon
given against the Defendant. Upon a writ of Error brought to reverse this
Judgment, it was alleged for Error, that the Judgment ought to have been a
general Judgment, and there ought not to have been a writ of enquiry, except
the party had prayed it, and to this the Court inclined, and Roll chief Justice
said, that it is otherwise in an Action against an Executor, for there assets
may be found. At another day Roll chief Justice said, Writ of inquiry.
if the Heir plead riens per descent, and if it be a false plea, a general
Judgment ought to be against him, and there shall be no writ to enquire what
lands he has, and it is not necessary, as here it is, to have a special
Judgment, Judgment.

THis case was again spoken unto, Error brought by the Bail to verse a judgment
given against the principal.
which was this, A Judgment was given in the Common pleas against the principal
without an original, and upon this Judgment there issued out a scire facias
against the Bail, and two nichils returned, and thereupon Judgment was given
against the Bail, and a writ of Error was brought by the Bail to reverse this
Judgment. And it was now argued by Hales of Council for the writ of Error, that
the Judgment was erroneous, because it being given upon a scire facias, which
is a judicial writ, it ought to be grounded upon an original, and it not being
so here, it is Error in fact, although it be not Error in Law. To this it was
answered, that two nichils returned upon a scire facias, amount to a scire
seci, and a judgment given thereupon is good, and therefore it is too late now
to say, that the scire facias was not well executed, Brook Sc. fac. 96. 28. 17

pleas, so that we could urge nothing against the scire facias. there; but here

Judgment is well given by the Judges, and how can you now make Error in it?

TVcker brought a replevin against Cosh, Special verdict in a replevin.
for distreining his Cattle. The Defendant makes conusance as Baily to I. S.
and upon the Avowry the case fell out to be this. A tradesman, in consideration
of marriage, made a conveyance of his lands to the use of himself, and of his
wife, and afterward becomes a Banckrupt, and a commission of Bankrupt is taken
out against him, and the lands of the Bankrupt are sold by the Commissioners to
the avowant that took the distress. The question here was, whether this
conveyance made by the Bankrupt of his lands was within the Statute of
fraudulent conveyances or not, and the sale made by the Commissioners of this
land were good. Maynard for the Plaintiff argued, that it is not within any of
the Statutes of Bankrupts. The Deed here is without fraud; and so it is not
within the Statute; for a valuable consideration is only expressed in the
Statute, and not a conveyance upon consideration of marriage, as it was in our
case. 2ly. The Feme is but one person with her Husband. 3ly. By comparing the
Statutes together it appears that the wife is not comprised within the Statute
of 1 Iacobi, which looks back to other Statutes touching Bankrupts, for the
wife is not named in the Statute of 1 Iacobi, but only children and other
persons, otherwise the words of the Act which do enumerate children, and other
persons, would be frivolous and idle, Roll chief Justice said, the Case is of
great consequence, and Crisp and Prats case does somewhat resemble this.
Bankrupt.
The Law intends a Bankrupt which is so by fraud, as well as a Bankrupt who
becomes so by accident, and for this cause is he called an Offender in the
Statute, and here the year of our Lord 1637, is the 13 year of the late King;
and the recovery suffered by the Bankrupt was then, and within half a year
after the recovery, he became a Bankrupt, so that me thinks there plainly
appears to be fraud in the Conveyance, Fraud.
but the fraud is not expressed in the pleading, as it might have been. The
Statute of 1 Iac. is somewhat doubtful as I conceive, and I do not see any
provision made in it against the wife, if fraud do not appear, for here is no
valuable consideration mentioned. Nicholas justice said, it is doubtful, yet
he conceived it within the Statute of 1 Iac. which ought to receive a large
construction, because it was made for the good of the Commonwealth. Ierman and
Ask agreed with Roll in omnibus. Roll, Here the matter in dispute is not in a
special Verdict, but comes in question upon point of pleading, Pleading.
which shall be taken most strong against him that pleads it, and he has not
expressed any valuable consideration, as he might have done, by saying in
consideration of a portion, or in recompense of marriage, or in performance of
Articles made upon marriage, or that the wife had joined in selling some part of
the land. The Court would advise, but inclined judgment ought to be for the
Avowant. Afterward judgment was given accordingly, for the Court held the
wife was within the Statute of 1 Iac. and the providing for wife and children
to be providing for himself.

IN an Action upon the Case the Plaintiff declared upon a Custom of commoning in
such a place. The Defendant demurred to the Declaration, Demurrer to a
Declaration in an Action on the Case.
and for cause shows that the Custom was not well laid; for the Plaintiff
declares of a Custom of commoning, pro averiis; viz. pro equis, bobus, equabus
et pullis, and the word pullis is of an uncertain signification, for it may
signify a Calf, a Lamb, or any other young Beast or Foul, and 23 Car. Segar
and Dyers Case was cited. The Court held the exception good, and said, that it
is uncertain what is meant by the word pullus, and said, that if the
prescripsion had been pro omnibus averiis, it had been good, Prescription.
and the viz. should have been void; but here it is only pro averiis.
Therefore, nil capiat per billam.

Newton against Godard.

A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a judgment given in an Action of Debt

The Case was this. There issued out a Capias against the Principal, and a
judgment was given against him; and after a scire facias issued out against
the Bail, and a judgment thereupon was given against the Bail; Then the
Plaintiff takes out an Execution, viz. a fieri facias against the Principal, and
Bail, upon both the judgments, to levy the debt recovered upon the goods and
chattels of the Principal and Bail, or either of them. It was alleged that the
execution thus taken out was not good, for there ought to have been several
executions upon the several judgments, Execution.
and not one execution, and to this the Court agreed, and ordered the Defendant
in the writ of Error to show cause why the judgment should not be reversed. In
this Case Roll chief Justice took an exception to the scire facias, Abreviation.
because it was scire fac. with a dash, which might be as well scire faciatis

the Husband brings a writ of Error in this Court to reverse this Judgment.
Roll chief Justice held, that the writ of Error did not lie, because the Record
cannot be removed by it, for that would disturb the proceedings in the Common
Pleas, and the party would have no fruit of his suit, if the Record should be
removed, nor any remedy to recover the arrears due unto him: Original. Scire

Yet the Original is determined by the Judgment given quod computent, and a
scire facias lies by the Executor, as the case here is. Ierman Justice to the
same effect, and cited 1 H. 7. f. 2. Nicholas Justice to the same intent; and
said, he did not much regard the Book of 21 Ed. 3. because there are other
Books against it. Ask Justice ad idem. Roll chief Justice put these cases. A
judgment was given in Dower for the Demandant, and another judgment that she
shall recover her damages, and this second judgment for the damages was
reversed by a writ of Error, because she did not aver that her Husband died
seized, in which case she is to have no damages; Judgment

Wallis against Bucknal.
Trin. 1651. Banc. sup.
Trin. 1649. rot. 600.
Upon a special Verdict the case fell out to be this. S^ec^al verdict upon a
Custom of a Manor.
One selfed of Copyhold lands of inh^ritance made a Letter of Attorney unto two
jointly and severally, to surrender the lands after his death to certain uses,
according to the Custom of the Manor. The question was, whether this was a good
Custom or no. Ellis of Council with the Plaintiff argued, that it was not a good
Custom, because a Custom ought to be reasonable, but this Custom is
unreasonable, because it is not only against a particular Law, but it is
against the general rule of Law to pass estates of inheritance in such a Manor;
and although particular Customs may be against public interest pro bo^o
publico, yet this is nothing to our case, for this is not for the public
good, and therefore it is not good. 2ly. An authority ought to be
countermandable, and to determine by the death of the party that gives the
authority; but here it is not so, but it is to continue after his death. Next,
no man can give authority to another to do a thing which he himself could not
do, but here it is otherwise, and therefore it is not good. Also by the death
of the Copyholder the Law settles the lands in the heir, and an authority
cannot divest them out of him; this is not like to the surrendering of Copyhold
lands into the hands of the Lord, for such a surrender cannot be revoked, but
this authority may be revoked: But which is more, the Verdict here does not
find that the two Attorneys are customary Tenants of the Manor, but only by way
of recital, which is not good, for they ought to have been found to directly;
nor does it appear that they were customary Tenants at the time of the
admittance of the party, neither is there any possession or title found in the
Defendant, and so the Plaintiff having primer possession, the Defendant is
culpable; neither is it found that the Customary Tenant, who gave this
authority, had an estate in fee-simple in the lands, and if he had but an
estate for life, he could not make such a Letter of Attorney; neither is the
authority given warranted by the Custom, and so he prayed judgment for the
Plaintiff. Wilmot for the Defendant, As to the authority, he said that it was
good, and did well enough survive the party that gave it, because it is
supported with a special direction from the party that gave it. 1 H. 7.8. and
this is the reason that an Executor may sell lands of the Testator after his
death, viz. because his authority is so supported, 21 E. 4. f. 8. 31 E. 1.
Fitz. Grants 45. And here in our case the heir has neglected his advantage,
and therefore shall not now be admitted to take it. But besides the authority
here given is more than a bare authority, for it is backed, with the
circumstances of time, persons, and of a Custom, which is not of a slight
esteem in Law, and by such a Custom which is very reasonable; for it is but to
enable the party to dispose of his own lands; and far more unreasonable Customs
than this are allowed in our Law, as that in Kent for an Infant of 15 years of
age to have power to sell his lands; neither is this Custom contrary to any
positive rule of Law; for it is here to create the authority to begin after the
parties death that created it, and so it is not to determine with his death,
for till then it begins not, and the Custom here is but to alien lands, which
is no strange thing, and this Custom extends but within the Manor, which is but
to a small compass of ground; and so the public is not much concerned in it,
and the case of 17 Car. in this Court, Bambridge and Whaddons case differs from
our Case; for that was not supported with a custom as this is. And it does
appear by the Record, that Dalby the Attorney is a customary Tenant, and the
admission is also found by the Verdict to be secundum consuetudinem Manerii,
and so that is well enough, and then one cannot gain a Copyhold estate by
disseisin, and so no primer seisin shall be intended, as was urged on the other
side, and it is also found that the Copyholder was seized. Roll chief Justice,
It will be a hard matter to maintain the Custom, Custom.
if it be not found that the Copyholder was seized in fee of the Copyhold
lands. 2ly. It is not here found that the land is demisable, according to the
will of the Lord, and so it may be free land, and then the custom does not
extend unto it, nor is it found that the parties to whom the Letters of
Attorney were made were Copyhold Tenants. Disseisin.
And the primer possession will make a disseisin here by the Defendant, if the
custom be not-well found, and so judgment must be for the Plaintiff. Devise.
And I cannot see how the Custom can be good, it being against the rules of
Law. Surrender.
A man cannot devise Copyhold lands, and this case is worse, but he may
surrender to the use of his last Will. If you will not consent to a new trial
we will advise, for it is a hard case, and my Brothers have not been attended
with Books. Mich. following Judgment was given for the Plaintiff, nisi. It was

BAtchelour brings a writ of Error to reverse a Judgment given against him for
Parsons in an Action of Debt in the Common Pleas, and the Error assigned was,
Error to reverse a judgment in debt.
that there are two Declarations in the Record, one in the Emparlance Roll, the
other in the Plea Roll, and the Original certified upon the writ of Error does
not warrant the first Declaration, for it was filed after it. Hales answered,
that the Record is good enough, if the Original dowarrant the last Declaration,
for this is the common course used in the Common Pleas, as the Clarks there do
inform me, and there are many Cases like this in the Common Pleas. Wild of
Council on the other side answered, that this is a strange course, for they
ought first to file the Original, because it is the beginning and groundwork
of the suit; and it not being so done here, the Judgment is given without an
Original, and this is a judgment by default, and the imparlance is part of the
suit. Roll chief Justice, Imparlance, Intendment, Certiorari.
The Imparlance Roll is the principal part of the suit, and to consound things
by intendment, that the imparlance may be touching another suit, is not good,
and it matters not what the Custom is in the Common Pleas, if it be against
Law, and both Rolls ought to be certified here. Ierman Justice ad idem. Roll
chief Justice, All the Record in the Common Pleas, which is in the custody of
the chief Justice there, ought to be certified by him upon the Retorn of the
Writ of Error, and here the Imparlance Roll is in his custody, and therefore he
ought to certify it; and if there be two writs of Error, Error.
and one is good and the other naught, we will take the best to affirm the
judgment. The Original ought not to be fitted to the Declaration, but the
Declaration to the Original, because the Original is the foundation of the
suit, and therefore the course used in the Common Pleas is a preposterous
course, Original.
viz. to declare against the Defendant, and after to file an original against
him, to warrant the Declaration. It is here certifyed to be one Record, and how
can we take the emparlance Roll to be part of the Record, it being not
certyfied with it? and if there be variance between the emparlance Roll, and
the plea Roll, Variance.
it is Error. We will advise; but we must not suffer new ways, yet we are
loath, notwithstanding to reverse Judgments given in the Common pleas.
Therefore show cause next term, why the Judgment should not be reversed.

passes to her in the Lands. For the first he argued, that the lands do pass
to the wife. 1. Because the generality of the words do include the lands, as
well as the goods, for the words are his whole Estate, so that nothing is
excluded, 9 E. 4. a release of all Actions, is held a release of all Actions
that the party had in all his capacities. 2ly. The ordinary manner of speech
does show that he intended to devise his lands, as well as his goods, Riches
case, Mich. 45. Eliz. C. Banc. A devise of all his rents was held to pass all
the parties lands. Also the subject matter in fact does prove this to be his
intent, and although here is not a collateral averment to prove the intention,
but a collateral proof to declare the Testators intent, this may be admitted to
ascertain the Court of his meaning, as it is in the case of proving an Act of
Parliament. In the Lord Cheneys case, an averment standing with a Will was
accounted allowable, though an averment against a Will be not; In Cooper and
Lanes case, 35 Eliz. a devise seigniori puero, where the Testator had a Son,
and a Daughter, was held a good devise to the Son, although puer signifies as
well a Daughter as a Son, and the Daughter there was elder than the Son, and
Hill 8. Car. In Bartler and Rodes case in B. R. a devise of all his lands in
Dale, if he had leases, as well as lands, there passed not the leases. For the
2d. point he argued that a fee simple passed. 1. Because his whole Estate is
devised, and that is to be applied as well to the lands, as to the goods. 2ly.
Because in regard that there is a consideration for it, to wit that the wife
shall pay his Debts, and discharge his Legacies; and whereas it is objected,
that it is not said she shall pay all his Debts, I answer, that it shall be so
intended. Here is land and goods mentioned, and not land only, and it is found
that the goods only are not sufficient to pay the Debts, and also the goods
were liable to the payment of the Debts, without this expression in the Will,
and therefore the land must be intended to be devised. And for the verdict it
is not material to find the lands to be held in socage, for they shall be
intended to be so held, because it is the most ancient Tenure, for where the
Law creates a Tenure, it shall be socage Tenure. 2ly. Lands may possibly be
deviseable, although they be not held in socage, for if they be neither held by
socage, nor chivalry, yet they are deviseable, Dyer 307. Neither is it material
to find the Debts, and Legacies paid, for it is a condition here, an not a
limitation, and there is a person to take advantage if the condition be broken,
and this is a special verdict, and the breaking of the condition if it had been
broken, would have appeared upon evidence, and therefore it is not necessary to
aver it, and it is in case of a Fee simple, which is an Estate intended to
continue. Devise.
Roll chief Justice held, that the lands did pass, for so he said the common
understanding imports, and the words do go to the value of the estate. 1. It
comprehends the thing, to wit the land. 2ly. The extent of the Estate given,
viz. Fee simple, and so it shall be here intended, and the words paying his
Debts and Legacies does enforce this construction, for they are to be paid
presently, which cannot be, if the lands pass not in Fee, and so the aberment
it is but to supply the meaning of the Testator, and stands very well with the
Will, and is not so collateral, as it is in Cheyneys case. And for the verdict
the lands shall be intended to be socage lands, Intendment.
as being the most Common Tenure, except the contrary were showed on the other
part, Denham and Bakers case, Mich. 24 (...). entered Trin. 23. rot. 12.80. and
the words paying his Debts, and Legacies, are words of condition, and not of
limitation. Ierman ad idem, and said, Condition^. Limitation.
when we say a man is a man of a great Estate, we mean his Estate in lands, as
well as goods. Nicholas and Ask Justices to the same effect; but Ask said he
doubted of the verdict, because no Legacies are found, and this is part of the
case. Iudicium pro querente nisi, Antea.

afterward takes out a capias ad satisfaciendum against him, whereupon he
brings his Audita querela, and moves the Court that he may have a supersedeas

view thereof. The rule was, that the party should proceed in his audita

Baker against Smith.
Trin 1651. Banc. sup.
BAker brought an Action upon the Case against Smith, and declared, Arrest of
Judgment in an action upon the Case upon an Assumpsit.
that whereas there was a speech concerning marriage between her the Plaintiff,
and Smith the Defendant, in consideration that she the Plaintiff would marry the
Defendant, the Defendant did assume and promise to her the Plaintiff, that he
would marry her, and that afterward the Defendant, in consideration that the
Plaintiff would discharge the Defendant of this promise, the Defendant did
assume and promise that he would pay unto her the Plaintiff, a thousand pound,
and that she did discharge the Defendant of his promise of marriage; and yet the
Defendant had not paid the 1000 l. according to his promise. Upon non assumpsit
pleaded, and a verdict found for the Plaintiff, It was moved in Arrest of
Judgment that there is mention of two promises in the Declaration, and that it
is uncertain to which promise the Declaration relates. 2ly. That there is no
temporal consideration alleged, but only a promise to dissolve a Contract of
Marriage, which is a thing illegal, and so no consideration. Roll chief Justice
answered, that here is a mutual promise made by both parties, Promise. Case.
and there have been diverse actions of late times brought for this cause, and
they have been adjudged good, and the engagement to marry is not merely a a
spiritual matter, and this Action is not to compel the marriage upon the
Contract, but to recover damages for not doing it, and it is like to a wager,
and here is a temporal loss, and therefore a temporal Action does lie. But it
was adjourned till next Term to be argued again, and then judgment was given
for the Plaintiff, for the Court held, that the dis-engagement shall be intended
to the party himself, and here is no need to express notice given of it,

KEnedy declared in an Action upon the case against Fisher for speaking these
words of him, he lost his Feet by the Pox, Whether a Plea of privilege was to
be allowed.
innuendo the French Pox: The Defendant demurred to the Declaration, and after
imparled, and then pleaded a plea of privilege. Hales desired the opinion of
the Court, whether this plea were now allowable, because the Books differed
about it. Roll chief Justice answered, that the plea is not allowable, because
there is but a privilege claimed by it, and the Plea goes not to the
jurisdiction of the Court, Therefore let the Defendant plead in chief.

Starkey against Mill.
Mich. 1651. Banc. sup.
Entered Trin. 1651. rot. 170.
STarkey brought an Action upon the Case against Mill upon two several
Assumpsits, Arrest of Judgment in an Action upon an Assumpsit.
and obtains a Verdict upon both, and entire damages are given: It was moved in
Arrest of Judgment, that one of the promises was not good, because there was
no consideration to ground it upon; and so the damages being entire upon both
the Assumpsits, and one failing, judgment cannot be given. The case was this.
The Father gave goods to his Son, in consideration that the Son should pay the
Plaintiff in this action 20 l. It was urged that this can be no consideration
for the Plaintiff to bring his action, because here is no debt due to him, but
only an appointment for the Son to pay money to him, in consideration of the
goods given him by his Father. But Hales on the other side said, that if there
may be a debt by any intendment due to the Plaintiff, Consideration.
then the Assumpsit is good, and here is a debt due to him, therefore the
Assumpsit is good. Roll chief Justice held, that it is good as it is, for there
is a plain Contract, because the goods were given for the benefit of the
Plaintiff, though the Contract be not between him and the Defendant, Case.
and he may well have an Action upon the Case, for here is a promise in Law
made to the Plaintiff, though there be not a promise in fact, and there is a
debt here; and the Assumpsit is good. Ierman and A^k Justices agreed, but
Nicholas doubted, But Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

Cressit against Burgis.
Mich. 1651. Banc. sup.
AN Action of Debt was brought upon the Statute of 2 Ed. 6. for tithes, Arrest
of Judgment in Debt upon the Statute of 2 Ed. 6. for tithes.
Upon nil debet pleaded, and a verdict and damages given for the Plaintiff, it
was moved in Arrest of Judgment that the damages given are for tithes growing
upon 71 Acres of land, whereas the Plaintiff in his Declaration declares but for
tithes growing upon 70 Acres of Land, so that the damages are given for more
than is declared for, and contrary to the demand. To this it was answered, that
this is but the mis-counting of the Jury, and is not material, Damages.
because by the whole Declaration it appears there was but 70 Acres, and this
is but a description by the Jury how the several parcels of land were sown,
viz. with what Corn. Roll chief Justice said, The Declaration is that the
Defendant was seized of 70 Acres of Arable land, and that so many Acres were
sowed with Wheat, so many with Oats, so many with Messing, so many with Beans;
and as to the 5 Aeres residue sowed with Barley, which all amounts to 71 Acres;
and it ought to have been as to 4 Acres residue, so that this is but a
mis-counting of the Jury, for the Jury cannot be deceived, for the land is
called but 70 Acres in the Declaration, and no damage arises to any by this
mistake. To which the rest of the Judges agreed, and judgment was given for
the Plaintiff, nisi.

THe Court was moved to reverse an Outlawry for want of Proclamation; Motion to

the question was whether it may be done by Attorney, the party himself, by
reason of infirmity of body, being not able to come in person: Upon view of the
Statute, Roll chief Justice said, he must come in person, otherwise it cannot
be done; yet the Court would advise. Afterward it was overruled, that it
could not be reversed except he come in person.

Drinkwater against Pack.
Mich. 1651 Banc. sup.
DRinkwater brought an action upon an Escape against Pack one of the Sherifs of
London, and obtains a Verdict against him. Arrest of Judgment in an Action for
an escape.
It was moved in Arrest of Judgment, that the Plaintiff declares that the party
was in the custody of both the Sherifs, and yet the Action is brought against
but one of them, the prisoner that escaped being in Ludgate, in the custody of
the Defendant Pack, Latch answered, that the Exception is not good, because in
Law the prisoner that escaped is in the custody of both the Sherifs. Hales on
the other side said, that it does not appear upon the Record, that he was in
the Custostody of both the Sherifs, and it shall not be supplied by a foreign
intendment, and the party shall be intended to be in custody, according to the
Custom of London, and not by the Common Law. Declaration.
Roll chief Justice held the Declaration good, for the prisoner was in custody
of both the Sherifs, although he was in the Custody of Pack, and it stands well
enough with the Record, and the words ut praefertur do not hurt the averment,
Averment.
and the words existent. in custodia is a good averment, that he was in
custody, as in an endictment, Tunc existens tenementum is good; and it is also
here found by the Jury that he was in custody; for how else could they find for
the Plaintiff. Ierman ad idem: But because the two other Judges had no Books
delivered them, they would deliver no opinion then. Afterward Judgment was
given for the Plaintiff.

Cottrell and his Wife against Theoballs.
Mich. 1651 Banc. sup.
COttrell and his Wife brought an Action upon the Case upon an Assumpsit
against Theoballs, and declared that the Defendant, Arrest of judgment in an
Action upon an Assumpsit.
in consideration that the Plaintiff would marry A. that is now the Plaintifs
wife, did assume and promise to the Plaintiff to make good a Legacy given unto
her by her Fathers Will, and would also give unto her 40 l. more out of his own
part given unto him by the said Will, at her age of 18 years, and declares
further, that thereupon he did marry her, and that the Defendant had not
performed his promise, and so concludes, to his damage so much. Upon non
assumpsit pleaded, and a Verdict for the Plaintiff, the Defendant moved in
Arrest of judgment, and took diverse Exceptions, but the Court insisted but
upon one of them, and that was held material, and it was this, That the Wife
did here join in the Action with her Husband, Action,
which she ought not to do, because the promise was made to the Husband only,
and for his benefit, and the sole consideration for the promise does arise from
the Husband, namely his marying the Feme; And Bafield and Collins his case, 22
Car. and Cheesman and Wats case 23 Car. were cited, and Roll chief Justice put
this case. A promise was made by one to a Feme Covert, that if the will procure
her Husband to levy a fine of such lands, that he would give her a riding suit;
And it was adjudged that the Baron and Feme cannot join in an action for breach
of this promise; and he said that in the case at Bar it was a mere covenant,
and no duty grew thereby to the Feme. Case.

GOodyer brought an Action of Trespass for an Assault and Battery, Demurrer to
a plea in an Action of Trespass.
and wounding of his Servant, and taking away 12 plate locks, against Shaw. The
Defendant Shaw pleaded not culpable to the Assault and Battery, and wounding,
and as to the taking away of the locks he pleaded a special plea of
Justification, by virtue of Letters Patents of incorporation granted to the
Lock-smiths of Durham by Cutbert Bishop of Durham, who had jura regali^ within
the County Palatine of Durham, and that by virtue of this Charter the locks
being not good, he as Warden of the Company did take them. To this Plea the
Plaintiff demurred, and for cause it was showed, that it appears not by the Plea
that the Black-smiths are a Corporation created by the Bishop, but only that
the Customs used amongst them in Order to the regulating of their Trade were
confirmed by the Bishop, which does not make them a Corporation, Plow. f. 199.
Long quint. f. 40, 41. 2ly. It does not appear by the Charter that they have
any authority to take away ill made locks; and therefore judgment was prayed
for the Plaintiff. Roll chief Justice said, That here does not appear any Order
made by the Corporation to take away the Locks, Corporation.
and therefore it was done without warrant, though the Corporation had such a
power; But besides it will be very hard to maintain the Lock-smiths to be a
Corporation, because the Bishop confirmed their Orders. Therefore let the
Plaintiff have his judgment, nisi.

Bishop against Fitzherbert.
Mich. 1651. Banc. sup.
BIshop brought an Action upon the Case against Fitzherbert, Arrest of
Judgment in an Action for words.
for speaking these words of him, thou art a Thief, and have stolen Horses:
Upon not guilty pleaded, and a verdict found for the Plaintiff, It was moved in
Arrest of Judgment, that as the words are laid in the Declaration they are not
A^ionable, for it is uncertain of whom they were spoken: The Declaration was
thus, That the Defendant Colloquium habens cum querente in the presence of
others, dixit, meaning the Plaintiff, Thou art a Thief, and have stolen Horses.
The Court at the first moving of this Case inclined the words were actionable,
because it shall be intended they were spoken of the Plaintiff, though it be not
directly said so: And afterward it being moved again, the Court held the words
well enough laid to bear an Action, because upon the whole Record the words
plainly appear to be spoken of the Plaintiff, and therefore Judgment was given
for him.

FReeman brought an Action upon the Case against Childeress for speaking these
words of her, She is a Whore, and I will prove her a Whore, Arrest of Judgment
in an Action for words.
and an arrant Whore. Upon not guilty pleaded, and a Verdict found for the
Plaintiff, it was moved in Arrest of Judgment that the words are not
actionable, because they are but words of choler, and spoken in passion, the
judgment at the first moving of it was stayed, yet it was then doubted whether
the words did not import more in them than to say barely of a woman, she is a
whore: But afterward it being again moved, Roll chief Justice said, that the
words were too generally spoken to be actionable, and that they are but words
of passion, and that before the Act made against Adultery, prohibitions have
been granted to the Prerogative Court for libelling against persons, for
calling of women whores, Prohibitions.

THe Court was moved to grant the good behavior against the L. Foliot, Motion

because he was endicted for a foul Battery at the Sessions in London and the

for it, and if there appear cause in the Articles it shall be granted.

old Mayor did not swear him in due time as he ought to do, but did adjourn the

Action of Covenant against the Executor of the Lessor the Defendant. The
Defendant pleads the acceptance of the 40 l. of the Assignor in satisfaction of
the wrong done him in Bar of the Action, and to this plea the Plaintiff
demurred. Bar.
The question here was, whether the Action of Covenant did lie against the
Defendant, since that the Plaintiff had received 40 l. of his Assignor in
satisfaction. Roll chief Justice said, that here is a double Covenant, one of
the Lessor, and the other of the Assignor, and therefore the party may have two
Actions, Action.
and therefore he is not here barred, to bring this second Action, though he
have barred himself by the acceptance of the 40 l. from bringing an Action
against his Assignor, and the Defendant has not pleaded that the 40 l. was
given in satisfaction of both the Covenants, for then it had been otherwise.
Ierman Justice to the same effect, That they are several Covenants, by several
deeds, and both the parties are severelly bound, and satisfaction given by one
of them, is not the satisfaction of the other. And he said if Lessee for years
assign over his Term the Lessor having notice thereof, and he accept the rent
from the assignee, he cannot demand the rent of the Lessee afterward, yet he
may sue other Covenants contained in the lease against him, as for reparations
or the like. The rule was for the Plaintiff to take his Judgment, nisi.

Cantrell against Stephens
Mich, 1651. Banc. sup.
CAntreli brought an Action upon the case against Stephens for stopping his way
in a Meoow called Madbrook in the parish of Redriff in Kent; Arrest of
judgment for an Action upon the case for stopping a way.
upon not guilty pleaded, and a verdict found for the Plaintiff, It was moved
in arrest of Judgment that the Plaintiff as Lessee, to the Haberdashers
company of London, claimed to have a way for them, whereas they having let the
land cannot have the way, but the Lessee in possession. 2ly. The prescription
is not rightly applied, for it ought to be for them to have a way pro
tenentibus et occupatoribus suis, which is not so here. Twisden answered it
shall be intended Tenants, and Occupyers to the Haberdashers, though it be not
said suis. Latch said that a prescription per que estate is good in an Action
upon the Case, because no land is claimed, and Green on the same side said, the
exception taken was helped by the verdict. Wild on the other side said, that it
does not appear that the Tenant who brings the Action, comes in by the
Haberdashers who claim the way, and so he cannot prescribe to have it,
Prescription.
and the prescription ought to be laid pro tenentibus and subtenentibus, which
Roll chief Justice denied, and said that it is laid that the Haberdashers were
seized in Fee, and postea huc usque and so they have the Fee at the time, and
may prescribe; but it had been better for the party to have showed that he was
their Tenant* but it being after a verdict, the question is whether it be not
helped, Upon reading the Record, Roll chief Justice observed, that it appeared
not whose Occupyer and Tenant the Plaintiff is; but only by way of argument;
but said the question is whether the verdict do help it, and he inclyned it did
not, Verdict.
because the Action is brought by the Tenant, who has not entitled himself to
the Action, for he has made only a title to the way in the Haberdashers; Title.
but has derived no Estate from them to himself. At another day Roll chief
Justice said, we must not take things by intendment, and here is a failer in
the very gist of the Action, for the Plaintiff has not entitled himself to the
Action, for he has no interest, for it appears not how he is Ocupyer of the
land, for he does not say he is Ocupator suus, and as he has laid the
Declaration, the Company ought to have brought the Action. Ierman Justice to
the same effect, and said that upon a demurrer it had been clearly naught and
the verdict here does not help it, for no title appears for the Plaintiff, and
the verdict cannot give him that he had not before. Nicholas and Ask Justices
to the same effect. Roll, If it had been Ocupator suus, I doubt it would not
make the Declaration good, because it shows not by what title So The rule was

IN an ejectione firmae upon a lease for 7 years there was a special verdict
found, Special verdict in an ejectione firmae.
and the questions in the Case grew upon the words of a Will that were false
orthography, viz. I do make my Cosen Giles Bridges my Solle Ayeare and my
Yexecutor, meaning my sole Heir, and Executor. Powis of Council with the
Plaintiff held, that the Will was good to make Giles Briges the Testators Heir
and Executor, notwithstanding the miswriting of the words, and that by the Will
the Land and personal Estate passed unto him, for he said, if by my Will I make
one my Heir, This is a devise to him of all my Lands in Fee, for the Devisee is
put in loco haeredis, and shall be like an Heir by descent, for he is haeres

for the intent of the Testator shall be followed, if it may be known, as it may

Another reason is, the word Heir is here written according to the
pronunciation, and sound of the word, though it agree not in letters, and H.
that is left out is no letter, but an asperte note, and the language in England
as it differs in time, so it differs in place, for men speak not, nor write,
English in all parts of England alike, and a Will in latin or greek is a good
Will within the Statute, so that it is not necessary for a Will to be good
English, and the Testator was bred in France, and could neither write nor speak
good English, and his Will so much the rather is to be favored. And false
English has been allowed in a Bond, viz. senteen for seventeen pounds, 9. rep.
48. a. much more may it be in a Will, and so he prayed Judgment for the
Plaintiff. Latch for the Defendant argued that the Will was not good, he
considered 2. points. 1. When a man makes one his solle Ayeare and Yexecutor
what construction the words shall have. 2ly. What Estate is conveyed by them.
And first he said that Hoberts Case cited by Powis was not to the purpose. 1.
Because it is not the principal case. And 2ly. It is but an opinion there, and
an Heir may be without land. And for Counden and Clarks case that was cited, as
it was urged, it is for me, and not against me, and there can be no authority
cited, that if one make a man his Heir, that his lands are thereby conveyed to
him in Fee simple. But in our case there can be no certain intent of the
Testator found out, and the making of one his Heir in France, where the
Testator was bred, according to the Civil Law there used, is but to make him
his Executor, and so the Testator might mean it. And if one in his Will say, I
make one of my Daughters my Heir, and do not say of his Lands, this shall not
disinherit the other Daughters, and if there should be any Estate conveyed
here, it cannot be but an Estate for life. Brook Done 44.8 Jac. C. B.

Will cannot be made good by conjectures, Hob. 34. Mich. 23 Car. Robinsons case,

dipthongue. Trin. 17 Car. C. B. rot. 74. and in Skirret and Skinners case libis
with a dash over put for libris was adjudged ill, and in our case here are
diverse words miswritten. And for the variation of our English dialect which is
objected it is to no purpose, because this will was lately made and the dialect
alters not in so short a time, and the dialect of the County where the Will was
made, viz. Gloucester Shire agrees not with the Will. And Hill. 6. Car. this
Will came in dispute in the Court of wards, and a decree there passed against
the Will in this point. The Court said, the case is doubtful, Will.
because the Will does not say, I make him heir of my Land, but generally my
heir and Executor, but the false writing hurts not a Will, if the Testators
mind may be found out. Adjourned to be argued again.

Wood against Topham.
Mich. 1651 Banc. sup.
VVOod brought an Action of Trespass upon the case quare filium and baeredem
rapuit et maritavit, against Topham, Arrest of judgment in an Action on the
case.
upon not guilty pleaded, and a verdidict found for the Plaintiff, the
Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment, and takes these exceptions to the
Declaration, 1. That the Plaintiff does not say cujus maritagium ad ipsum
pertinet. 2ly. That he does not say that the Heir was within age; and Maynard
of Council with the Defendant said that the exceptions are not to the writ, but
to the Declaration, and the Action being a Trespass to recover the Damages,
the Plaintiff ought to entitle himself to the marriage for the loss whereof he
would recover damages, for the Heir it may be is not Heir apparent to him, and
then is no marriage due to him, and here is a special Declaration, for the loss
of the marriage. Roll chief Justice answered, Writs. Declaration.
the writs are good both ways, and so may the Declaration be either with those
words, or without them, and he makes not the ground of his Action, to be that
the marriage belonged to him; Common right.
but of Common right it does belong to him, and the words are used to be
alleged, only to increase the Damages, and the ground of the Declaration is
only quare filium suum and haeredem rapuit, and for this the Plaintiff ought to
have his Judgment. Ierman Justice differed, and said, the Plaintiff does not
show he had any damage by the marriage, and it may be that he had been married
before, or was of full age and so no cause of Action. Nicholas Justice, as
Roll, and said that by the Law the marriage belongs to the Father, and it may
prove a dishonor to the family to have his son taken away, and married without
the Fathers consent. Ask Justice to the ^ams effect, and so Judgment was given
for the Plaintiff, nisi. Antea.

Mich. 1651. Banc. sup.
THe Court was moved to mitigate fines, Motion to mitigate fines for riots,
that were to be set upon rioters that were found guilty upon an information
exhibited against them, for the riotous cutting down of wood. But Wild on the
other side prayed there might be good fines set upon them according to the fact
found upon the Record, because it was a foul riot. The Court answered, they are
found guilty of the riot, Fine.
and therefore the fine cannot be less than ten pounds at the least for the
principal, there being a verdict in the case, and so let it be, and 4. marks a
piece for the rest. For we must preserve the peace of the County.

Baker against Smith.
Mich. 1651. Banc. sup.
THe case of Baker and Smith formerly spoken to was again moved, In answer to a
matter spoken in arrest of judgment
and Maynard answered the exceptions offered in arrest of Judgment. 1. It was
objected that here was not a mutual promise set forth between the parties, for
there is no agreement made by the Feme, for it is only said, that she consented
to marry the party, which is not a binding agreement. To this he answered, here
was a mutual, and binding agreement, though it be not so plainly expressed in
words as it might have been, 3 H. 6.36, 37. A verbal promise may be discharged
by words, and so it is here, London and Stokes case, Trin. 10 Car. rot. 236.
Next it is not necessary here to give notice of the discharge of the promise,
though if there be notice it is well enough, because the thing to be done upon
it, to wit the payment of the 1000 l. is certain, and the discharge shall be
intended to be in the presence of the party to whom it is given; for the
Declaration is exoneravit ipsum, which shall not be intended in his absence.
Pasch. 10 Car. Harvy and Inglethorps case, and Mich. 8 Iac. Martin and Wilbie,
Hodges and More, Pasch. 1 Car. Banc. Reg. 7 Iac. Bradlyes case. 14 Iac. Beedly
and Goodrose. Latch on the other side argued, that here is no binding promise
on the behalf of the woman to marry with the Defendant, and so the discharge of
it can be no consideration; for this is not a reciprocal, but a bare
acceptance of the promise made by the other; and an action of the case lay not
against her if she had refused to marry with the Defendant, because here is no
repromission made by her. 2ly. It appears not that the discharge was in
convenient time, for it was 2 years after; but admitting that to be so, yet
here is no notice of the discharge, and that is necessary to be given, and it
shall not be intended to be given without showing it, for the Declaration ought
to be certain, and here is no inducement in it that there was any notice given
in his presence, and if it were given in his absence, he ought to have notice
given him of his discharge, else how should he know it: and it were
unreasonable to charge him if he had no notice, and by a third person he cannot
receive notice, as it is in the Cases put by Mr. Maynard on the other side. In
the Case of Peck and Ingram in this Court adjudged that the party ought to have
notice when the Feme left her Fathers House and came to such a place. Roll
chief Justice said, here are two promises, 1. The Feme assumed, that if the
Defendant would marry her, she would consent to him; Consideration Prom^se in
Law. Mutual Contract. Implication.
and here is a consideration, although there be not an absolute mutual promise,
for it is a promise in law, and the Action may be laid by way of consideration,
or by way of mutual Contract. 2ly. Here is but a promise de futuro, and there
may be a temporal loss, although the thing to be done, viz. the marriage, be
spiritual; And the dis-engagement of the party does not imply notice; but the
demand of the 1000 l. now implies a discharge, nor can the party here take
notice of a third person, and therefore it is necessary to give him notice;
Notice.
for where the party cannot take notice from any but the party himself, there
notice must be given him. Ierman Justice held, here was a good mutual promise
to raise a consideration, and by the words exoneravit ipsum, it shall be
intended to be to the person, himself, and this implies a notice, especially it
being after a verdict. Nicholas Just. much to the effect as Roll chief Just.
but he doubted whether the words do imply a personal notice, for it may be it
was in his absence, and the verdict will not help it, and so there can be no
judgment. A^k Justice said, here was a good promise, but the words exoneravit
ipsum do not imply a notice, so the Court was divided, and would advise.

Hume against Hinton.
Mich. 1651. Banc. sup.
HUme brought an Action upon the Case against Hinton, A^rest of judgment in an
Action upon the case upon a promise.
and declared, That whereas the Son of the Defendant did in his lifetime owe
unto the Plaintiff 8 l. and dyed intestate, the Plaintiff did demand the said 8
l. of the Defendant, being Mother to the intestate; whereupon she being
satisfied of the justness of the debt, did assume and promise unto the
Plaintiff, that if he would stay for the money till Mich. next, that then she
would pay it. Upon non Assumpsit pleaded, and a verdict found for the Plaintiff,
the Defendant moved in Arrest of Judgment, that here was no consideration to
ground the Assumpsit upon, because it was not the debt of the party that
assumed to pay it, neither was she Executor or administrator nor consequently
liable any way by law to pay it, and therefore an Assumpsit to pay a remediless
debt, if the Plaintiff would stay for it, is no good Assumpsit, as in 6 Car. in
this Court, in Morgans Case. An Assumpsit to pay the rent of the land behind,
if the party would forbear to distrain Corn in the shocks, was adjudged no good
Assumpsit, because such Corn is not distreinable, and it appears not here what
person the Son was, or where he lived, or that he either had or lest any goods,
and the mere ground of the Action is the piety of the Mother, and no other
matter, And here appears no person liable to pay this debt, neither plainly,
nor by intendment, and the Ordinary is not chargeable if no goods come to his
hands. And 2ly. There is now no Ordinary, for it is taken away by the
Parliament, and 9 rep. Bains case is not like to this case, neither is Jones
and Smiths case, Trin. 8 Iac. rot. 192. like to this case, for there was a
person liable to be sued, but it is not so here, so that this is a stronger
case. But if there should be a good consideration, yet the averment of the
performance of it is not good, for it is not certain how he stayed, Wild for
the Plaintiff held, that here is a good consideration, because the Plaintiff is
hereby tied not to sue any person whatsoever for the debt till Michaelmas, and
so it is a prejudice to him to forbear: And it shall be intended here that the
Intestate did leave sufficient goods to satifie the debt; and though there be
no Ordinary, yet the party that takes the goods may be sued, and the Case of
Homes and Smith cited is for the Plaintiff in my Report, and the judgment is
not there entered in the Roll, but in the Margent only, it is entered pro
Defendente, and the case of Hill and Baily is since that, and that is with me,
and is to be preferred before the other, because it is a later judgment. 2ly.
The averment is good in substance, although it be not so express in words as it
might have been, and it is now after a Verdict. The Court for the first point
held, here was a good consideration, Consideration.
for it is that the Plaintiff shall forbear to sue for the money generally,
which goes to all the world, and it is not only to forbear to sue a particular
person, but to forbear to sue for the money; and this forbearance may be a
prejudice to the party, and a loss in not suing till that time. But for the
latter exception Roll chief Justice said, if the breach be not well assigned
the verdict will not help it; Breach.
and you say that you stayed in expectation of the money, and do not say
absolutely that you stayed. Therefore let us see a book, Ordinary.
and speak to the last point again on Saturday next. In this case Roll chief
Justice said, where there is no body else to be sued for a Debt, the Ordinary
is to be sued, Debt.
although he is not to be charged, if he have no goods, and in London it is
usual to do it; and now Sir Nathaniel Brent is in place of the Ordinary
throughout all England, Afterward judgment was given for the Plaintiff, because
the consideration and the averment were held both good.

Mich. 1651. Banc. sup.
ONe Harding was endicted 21 Car. for an Assault and Battery made in
Westminster hall, and the party found guilty: For a rule to enter judgment.
the Court was moved for a rule to enter judgment against him, because it was
so long since the Verdict. But the Court said, if you may do it by the rules of
the Court enter it, for we will make no rule without hearing the other side,
therefore give notice, and then move it again.

Mich. 1651. Banc. sup.
AN Action of Debt was brought upon an Obligation of 2000 l. for performance of
the Covenants of an Indenture. Demurrer to a D^claration in D bt upon an
Obligation to perform Covenants. Discontinuance.
The Defendant demurs to the Declaration, and the Plaintiff joins in the
Demurrer; and after reading of the Record, and the Exceptions opened, Twisden
moved the Court for the Plaintiff, that he might discontinue his action, because
there was a fault in the laying it. Roll chief Justice said, Let it stay as it
is this Term, for this is in our discretion, and it is but a slip in pleading,
and in the mean time we will advise.

Barnard against King.
Mich. 1651 Banc. sup.
Pasch. 1651. rot. 467.
BArnard brought an Action of Debt upon an Obligation of 500 l. to stand to an
Award, D murrer to a repsication in D^bt upon an Obligation to stand to an
Award.
The Defendant pleaded nullum arbitrium. The Plaintiff replies that the Vmpire
made the award, and sets it forth, and assigns a breach: To this Replication
the Defendant demurred, and takes exception, that the Plaintiff sets forth that
the Arbitrators could not agree, and after they had denied to make the Award,
the same day the Vmpire made the Award. Latch of Council with the Defendant
held this Award set forth in the Replication to be naught, because the
submission was, that if the Arbitrators shall not make the Award to morrow,
then the Vmpire shall make the Vmpirage; and here the Vmpirage is made upon the
same day that was given to the Arbitators to make the Award, and they have the
whole day by the submission to make it in, and although they cannot agree to
make it one part of the day, they may agree afterward the same day to make it,
and this disagreement is not a giving up of their authority, and Wood and
Clements case, 24 Car. is not against this, 2ly. It is not said that the
arbitrament was delivered, 3ly. The matter awarded is not within the
submission, namely the payment of the rent expressed. Hales on the other side
argued, that the Vmpire might make the Award upon that day that is set forth;
and the Condition here is all one, as if it had been said, if the Arbitrators
make the Award to morrow, or if the Vmpire make the Award to morrow. Pasch. 14
Iac. Barry and Fells case. And the words here Postquam denegassent, et
deseruissent is a direct averment that the Arbitrators could not agree to make
the Award; and Arbitrators may make an award after they have chosen an Vmpire;
and although the Vmpire had power to make the Vmpirage a day after they made
it; yet it it be made before it is a good Vmpirage, if the Law permit it, and
the Vmpirage here is well delivered, for the submission is not that it shall be
delivered to both parties, but generally that it shall be delivered, and
therefore it is well if it be delivered to one, it being ready to be delivered
to the other: And for the payment of the rent, although it be a future Act, yet
being matter of satisfaction, it is good, although it be not expressed in the
submission. (...)
Roll chief Justice said, for the last matter the words super praemissis brings
the payment of the rent within the submission, otherwise the awarding of the
payment thereof would not be good by way of satisfaction: But here the
Controversy is for the land for which the rent is to be paid, and the matter
does not appear to be out of the submission, and it is not necessary to aver
that the land was in Controversse. Averment.
2ly. For the delivery of the Award it is well enough as it is, for it is not
specified to whom the Vmpire shall deliver the Vmpirage, although it be
expressed to whom the Arbitrators were to deliver their Award, if they had made
it. But the main question here is, if the Vmpire could make the Vmpirage the
day it was made; and for that I hold he could not, Umpirage.
because the authority given by the submission to the Arbitrators was not
determined when the Vmpirage was made; Award.
and by the submission the Arbitrators have no authority to make an Vmpire, for
then it had been good, and it appears not that the Vmpire had concurrent
authority with the Arbitrators; for it is not said if the Arbitrators make no
arbitrament then the Vmpire shall make it; but here is a Condition for the
Arbitrators to have all the day precedent to make the arbitration in, and no
concurring power is given to the Vmpire that day, for the Arbitrators have all
of it to agree in, and till it is ended the Vmpire has no power at all,
otherwise the submission would be repugnant in it self. The rest of the Judges
concurred in all, and so ruled, That the Plaintiff all capiat per billam, nisi.

Theoballs against Newton.
Mich. 1651. Banc. sup.
ONe was sued upon the Statute of Inmates, and the distringas jurata bare date
on a Sunday, and out of Term, and so is erroneous, The question here was,
whether it be not helped by the Statutes of Ieofails, of 18 Eliz. and 21 Iac.
Roll chief Justice held, Ieofails,
that the Statutes extend not to penal Laws, although it be ambiguously penned,
nor to any processes grounded upon them, for the Proviso exempts the Original
action, and by consequence all processes depending upon it are excepted, Venire
de novo.
so that here is no good trial, but there shall be a venire de novo, nisi.

Tailor and Webb.
Mich. 1651. Banc. sup.
THe Case of Tailor and Webb which arose upon a special verdict upon these
words of Will, Special Verdict upon the words of a Will.
viz. I make my Cosen Giles Bridges my soll ayere and yexecutor, was again
moved and argued by Hales, and he made three questions. 1. Whether any estate
passes by the words of the will. 2ly. If any. what estate passes. 3ly.
Whether the false Orthography does hurt the Will. For the first he said, that
by making one his sole heir his land passes to him. The word heir is to be
considered either in relation to an Ancestor, and so one cannot make one his
heir, or it may be considered in relation to a thing to be inherited, to wit
lands or tenements, and so one may make another his heir, and thus a Custom may
make one a man's heir, as it is in Borough English; and an accident may thus
also make one a man's heir, as it is in the Case of possessio fratris, Coundens
case, Hob. Rep. Case 947. And here it is all one to make one his heir, and to
make hint heir of hislands; and the reasons are, First, the word heir here
cannot have any other relation than to the Testators lands, for he cannot make
him his heir otherwise, and the words may be more reasonably intended so. 2ly.
The words carry in them the plain intention of the Devisor, that the party
should have his lands, although the words are not very proper ^ H. 7. A devise
of lands to his son after the death of his wife, passed an Estate for life to
the wife, although no such Estate was expressed in the Will; so here, although
no express Estate of land be devised, yet the Devisee shall have the lands by
the intent of the Devisor. 3ly. In ordinary speech, if one make such an one his
Heir, it is intended that he gives him his lands, 8 Car. in the C. B. in Spurt
and Bents case. A devise of his inheritance, was held a devise of his lands,
and Trin. 3. Iac. in Terryes case, A devise of all his rents in tail passed his
lands, because in vulgar acceptance it is the rents of lands, and in Pits and
Sands case in this Court. A devise of all his free lands in Holford did pass a
portion of Tithes, and in the case of one Johnson, a devise of all his estate
passed all his lands. And the words cannot bear the fence to make him Executor,
according to the Civil Law, as has been objected, for the Will shall be
intended as it is, to be an English man's Will, and so the word Heir in it shall
he interpreted according to out Law, and not the Civil Law, and even in the
Civil law to make one his Heir does convey unto him all his lands, for he is
haeres testamentarius, although not haeres legitimus. And in this Will here are
two expressions, for the party is made Heir and Executor, which two words
cannot signify one thing, for that would be an idle expression. 4ly. There are
some clauses in the Will, which show the intent of the Testator was to convey
his lands, if it were needful to make use of them. 1. There are several
annuities for the Devisee to pay. 2ly. He directs him where the conveyances and
assurances of his lands were laid up, which plainly show he meant he should
have his land. 3ly. The words Heir and Executor are joined together, to show
that he gives him all his lands and goods, else one of the words must be
imperfect, and ineffectual, which shall not be intended. For Authority 7 E. 6.
Br. devise 38. by devising that one Son shall be Heir to the other, it shall be
intended of lands, so in construction of law it shall be here intended that the
Devisor made him Heir of his lands, Hob. Reports. in Sparks and Burnells case,
William and Anthony shall be each others Heir, and it is not said of land, yet
adjudged that it shall be so meant, and so is it in our case, and if I have
lands in see simple, and make one my heir, it shall be intended that he shall
have my lands in see simple, although I say not that I make him Heir of my
lands. For the second question, the reasons before expressed do also show that
the lands are passed in Fee, as it is in Purnells and Hambletons case, for the
word Heir shall relate to the same Estate, that the party had in the land, who
makes the other his Heir, 8 Iac. Inkersals case. For the 3d point, whether here
shall be any good devise at all, by reason of the false English, he said it was
all one, and to as good effect as if the words were all true English, and
neither the incongruity, nor the insufficiency of the words shall hurt the
Will, as it is pretended. For 1. This is not in case of pleading or of writs;
but in conveyance of lands. It is true that in the former it does hurt, because
writs and pleadings may be amended, if they be naught; but it is fatal in
conveyances, for they cannot be amended, as in Trotman and Standards case,
Trin. 1651. in this Court it was held that impropriety of words shall not hurt,
it they can admit of a good construction. Desinet in piscem mulier formosa
superne. 2ly. This is in a Will, which is such an instrument, that is much
favored in Law and therefore to be favorably construed. 3ly, This is an
English Will, and admits of much variety of dialects, and therefore is not to
be critically interpreted. Neither are there here any insignificant, or
missignificant words, as has been objected, but significant, for the sound of
the word as it is written is the same as if it had been rightly spelled, for
Air and Heir sound both alike. As in 3 H. 4. f. 4 Baxter and Baxster sounded
alike. 2ly. If the word Heir might receive any other sense, yet it cannot do so
here, because there are other words joined to it, to declare and signify that
the Testator meant Heir of his Lands, and not the element of Air, or a year,
as has been strangely objected, and would prove a ridiculous construction.
Osborns case 10. rep. in Thyns case in this Court a demand of dower de capella,
although the word were of doubtful construction in it self, yet by the subject
matter, it was held to be made certain enough, so the word Ayeare here shall
receive construction according to the subject matter, and the coupling of it
also with the word Yexecutor, which is also falsely written, shows the
Testators intent. For answer to the main objection, viz. that in 6 Car. there
was a decree made in the Court of wards, by advise of the Judges, that this was
a void and senseless Will, I say that that decree is not of so great weight,
as is a Judgment given in a Court of judicature at the common Law, and this
was but an opinion delivered in Court, where the Judges were not Judges, and
the decree was made as I am informed. because they believed the Will to be
nonsense, Heir.
the contrary whereof does appear by my argument. The Court enclyned strongly
that the Testator intended to make the Devisee Heir of his lands, and that the
words can receive no other construction, for other constructions would be very
strange, Will.
and forced, and the party that made the Will, is to be considered as one that
was inops consilii, and also that wanted a scribe, and his intent seems plain,
and shall not be taken according to the Civil law, and if it should, the word
Heir will as well extend to the lands as goods. Adjourned to be argued again.

Kymlock against Bamfield.
Mich. 1651. Banc. sup:
Mich. 24. Car. rot. 592.
KYmlock brought an Action upon the case upon an indebitatus assumpsit against
Bamfield, for making of apparel. The Defendant pleaded, Demurrer in an action
on the case upon an indebitatus assumpsit.
that he became bound in a Bond of 60 l. to the Plaintiff in satisfaction of
the Debt, and that the Plaintiff accepted of it, the Plaintiff replied that he
did not accept of it, to this replication the Defendant demurred; and shows for
cause, that the Plaintiff had tendered an issue upon the non acceptance of the
Bond, whereas it should have been that the Defendant non devenit tentus. On the
other side it was said that it is well enough, and that it is sufficient to say
non accep it, and it is not necessary to say he refused the obligation, and
though the replication be not good, yet the plea is also naught, and therefore
no Judgment can be for the Defendant. The plea is quod devenisset tentus,
whereas it ought to be devenit tentus. And 2ly. He shows not in what sum or
place; nor that he became bound in satisfaction. Roll chief Justice said, that
by entering into Bond the former contract is gone, if you do not refuse it, and
it is not sufficient to say you did not accept of the Bond, for you may yet
accept it if you please, and the party cannot plead non est factum, Contract.
if you bring an Action upon it, until it be absolutely refused, and the
contract here is turned into a Bond, and the law determines the contract, Plea.
and it is not all one with pleading of the acceptance of a horse in
satisfaction, or or any other thing as a collateral satisfaction, and the
Plaintiff ought to show that he refused the Obligation, and does yet refuse it.
And here is a negative preignans, Negative preignan^.
for you imply by saying that you accepted not the Obligation in satisfaction,
that he gave you the obligation, and you might have said, Non devenit tentus,
and for the other exceptions they are to no purpose, Discontinuance
And therefore Judgment ought to be given against you; but by the favor of
the Court we can give you leave to discontinue your Action.

Harding against Freeman.
Mich. 1651. Banc. sup.
HArding brought an Action upon the Case against Freeman, and declared against
him, Arrest of Judgment in an Action upon the case upon the sale of a Horse.
that the Defendant did sell unto him a Gelding, and upon the sale did falsely
affirm unto him, that the Gelding was his own Gelding, and that he bred him of
a Colt, whereas he bred him not of a Colt, neither was it his own Gelding, but
another man's Gelding, and so concludes to his damage. Upon not guilty pleaded,
and a Verdict found for the Plaintiff, the Defendant moved in Arrest of
Judgment, 1. That in this sale of the Gelding, the Defendant had made no
warranty of him; and therefore though the sale were not good, yet the Action
lies not. 2ly. The Plaintiff does not declare that the Defendant knowing the
Gelding to be another man's, did affirm him to be his own, and so here does not
appear to be any fraud in the sale. Twisden answered, that the words are
sufficient to imply a disceit, though they express not, that he knowing it to
be another man's horse did make that affirmation, for the words are that he did
it falso et fraudulenter, and affirmed the Horse to be his own. But the Court
stayed the Judgment, for they said, that here is no direct affirmation, but
only an intendment that scienter fecit, yet afterward, judgment was given for
the Plaintiff.

Davis against the Lord Foliot.
Mich. 1651. Banc. sup.
DAvis brought an action of Assault and Battery and wounding against the Lord
Foliot, and had a verdict against him, and a writ of enquiry of damages, For a
new writ of Enquiry of damages.
and upon the writ of Enquiry 200 l. damages were found. The Plaintiff moved the
Court for a new writ, because by reason of the wilfulness of the Jury the
damages were found too small. Twisden on the other side urged, that it could
not be, because there was no miscarriage proved in execution of the writ, but
it appears to be well executed. Roll chief Justice answered, though we grant
not a new writ, yet we can increase the damages upon view of the wound, and
here appears to have been a foul Battery by the dagger produced in the Court,
Damages increased by the Court.
and by the party himself that is wounded, and it is not fit that a wilful
Jury should prejudice the party, therefore either consent to a new writ, or
else bring your witnesses on both sides and we will hear the motion again. At
another day Wild said, the Court cannot increase damages upon a view of the
party, if he be not maimed, and here is no maiming, but only a Battery and
wounding: But the Court answered that they would advise upon that point, for it
seems there is the same reason for increasing of damages in both cases. At
another day Green moved for increase of damages upon the view, and urged 9 H.
4. f. 1. 3 H. ^. ^ 10 H. 4. and Bret and Middletom case in this Court. Twisden
on the other side confessed the Books were so, but here the Battery is not
apparent, and the wound is internal, and not to be viewed by the Court. Roll
chief Justice said, 3 things are considerable, 1. whether the Court can
increase the damages, 2ly. Whether the wound be apparent? and 3ly Whether the
damages given be too small? The Court upon view of the party, and examination
of Chirurgions and Witnesses on both sides upon Oath, did conclude that they
might increase the damages, and that the wound was apparent, and that the
damages were too small, and therefore they increased them to 400 l. and said
they would not increase them more, because they could not inquire into all the
circumstances of the fact, as the jury might, but they thought fitting to
increase them in some proportion, because the offense was great, and such
outrageous Acts are not to be slightly punished.

Wallis against Bucknal.
Hill. 1651. Banc. sup.
Upon a special verdict found in an Ejectione firmae the case sell out to be
this: Special Verdict in an Ejectione firmse.
A Copyholder of inheritance made a Letter of Attorney to two jointly and
severally to surrender his Copyhold lands in Fee to certain uses, after his
death, according to the Custom of the Manor. The question made by Ellis of
Council with the Plaintiff was, whether the Custom was good or not? and he
argued, that it was not a good Custom. In Sir John Davis Reports it is said, a
Custom must be reasonable, and a Custom may be reasonable, when it is but
against a particular Law, and not a general Law; but the Custom here thus to
convey land, is against a general Law. Particular Customs may be against
public interest, pro bono public but if they be not, as in our case they are
not, they are not good. Pro bono publico.
Next an authority given ought to be Countermandable, and to determine at the
death of the party; but this is not so, and therefore it is no good authority,
19 E. 3. f. 5. 2ly. None can give an authority to another to do a thing which
he could not do himself; but here it is otherwise, and therefore it is not a
good authority. 3ly. By the death of the Copyholder the lands are settled in the
heir, and this authority given shall not divest them, and this is not like the
surrendering of lands into the hands of the Lord; for a surrender cannot be
revoked, but this authority is revokable. Next, the Verdict does not find that
the 2 Attorneys are Customary tenants, but only by way of recital, which is not
good; nor does it appear they were customary tenants, at the time of the
admittance; and here is not found any possession or title in the Defendant, and
so the Plaintiff having primer possession, the Defendant is guilty; neither is
it found that the customary Tenant had see-simple in the land; And if he had
but an estate for life he could not make such a letter of Attorney. Also the
authority given is not warranted by the Custom set forth. Wilmot of Council
with the Defendant, said, That this authority here is supported with a special
direction, which may survive the party that gives it, 1 H. 7.8. And an
authority may survive the party that gives it; else how can an Executor sell
lands by the authority given unto him, 21 E. 4. f. 8. 31. E. 1. Fitzherb. 45.
and as for the heir he has neglected his advantage, it he had any, and cannot
now take it: But besides, the authority here given is more than a bare
authority, for it is backed with circumstances of time and person; and here is
also a Custom to support it, and this Custom is a reasonable Custom, for it is
but to enable a man to dispose of his own lands: and there are far more
unreasonable Customs than this allowed in our law, as the Custom of Kent, for
one of the age of 15 years to be enabled to sell his lands, and this Custom is
not against any positive rule of Law, for the custom is, to create the
authority to begin after his death, and so it is not to determine by his death;
for till then it begins not; and the Custom here is but to alien lands, which
is no strange thing, and it is extended but within a small compass of land, and
so cannot be very prejudicial to the public. And Bambridge and Whaddons case
17 Car. in this Court, cited on the other side does differ from this case, for
t^ere was no Custom to support it. And it does appear here by the Record, that
Dalby the Attorney is a customary Tenant, and the admission here is found to be
secundum consuetudinem Manerii. And one cannot gain a Copyhold estate by
disseisin, and so here can be no primer seisin intended, and it is found the
Copyholder is seized. Roll chief Justice said, It will be hard to maintain the
Custom, Custom.
if it be not found that the party was sei^^d in see of the Copyhold lands. But
2ly, it is not here found that the land is demisable, according to the will of
the Lord, and so it may be free land, and then the custom does not reach it.
Neither is it found that the 2 Attorneys were Copyhold Tenants, and the primer
possession here will make a disseisin by the Defendant, if the Custom be not
well found, and then it is for the Plaintiff, and I cannot see how the Custom
can be good, it being against the rules of Law; for a man cannot devise a
Copyhold, and here the case is worse, Devise.
but he may surrender to the use of his last Will and Testament. At another day
Wilmot to the Exception taken, That it is not found that the two Attorneys were
Tenants of the Manor, said, there is so much found as shall make them be
presumed to be Tenants of the Manor, for it is found that the party is admitted
secundum consuetudinem Manerii, which cannot be a good admittance if they were
not Tenants. Roll chief Justice answered, to be admitted secundum
consuetudinem, goes ^o the Admittance, not to the Letter of Attorney: But we
will advise. At another day Twisden prayed judgment for the Plaintiff, and
insisted upon the Exception that the two Attorneys were not found customary
Tenants; for one of them is not mentioned at all, and the other is found so
only by way of recital, and so they have not entitled themselves to the Custom,
and then the Defendant has no title. The Court ruled to show cause Saturday
following why the Plaintiff should not have judgment. Antea.

Custodes against Tawny and Norwood.
Hill. 1651. Banc. sup.
TAwny and Norwood were jointly endicted for blasphemous words severally spoken
by them, Endictment for speaking blasphemous words.
upon the late Statute made against blasphemy, and were convicted, the parties
being removed hither by Habeas Corpus. It was urged that the Endictment was not
good, because it was joint, whereas the words being spoken by them severally,
they ought to have been endicted severally; for the words spoken by one of them
cannot be said to be the words of the other. But Roll chief Justice said, The
Endictment was good enough, though it be joint, as it is in the case of several
perjuries, and several batteries, where a joint Endictment does lie, although
it do not for several felonies, and here the Endictment is upon one and the
same Statute, and for one and the same offense, and therefore the judgment
given upon it is also good, and it shall be taken reddendosingula singulis (i.)

Floyd against Morgan.

A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in an Action of
Trespass, for taking away diverse goods, Error to reverse a judgment in
Trespass for taking away goods. Anglice.
and the Error was that there were the words instrumentum ferri used in the
Declaration to express diverse things, viz. de quodam instrumento ferri, Anglice
a Grioiron, and de quodam instrumento ferri, Anglice a Brandiron, et de quodam
instrumento ferri, Anglice a Mortar, whereas there are proper Latin words for
them, and therefore are not to be so uncertainly described. Darcy against the
writ of Error said it was certain enough as they were described, and cited the
Reg. f. 45. and said, if it be not certain in the Latin description,
Description.
yet the Anglice helps it. Roll chief Justice demanded, what say you to the
Case of instrumentum ferri, Anglice a Horse-lock, adjudged naught lately in
this place? and there are proper Latin words for the things you describe, which
you ought to have used, therefore this description is not good; for where a
Latin word signifies many things, there an Anglice is proper to be added to it,
otherwise not, and if there be no Latin word to express a thing, one may invent
a word, and interpret it with an Anglice, but it is not so here, therefore let
the judgment be reversed, nisi, etc. Postea.

A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a judgment in a Trespass vi et armis

Trespass vi et armis.
That the Plaintiff declared that the Defendant took certain Cows of his out of
the Jurisdiction of the Court, and brought them within the jurisdiction, and
there disposed of them to his own use, In which case, in regard that the taking
of the Cattle, which is the ground of the Action, was without the jurisdiction
of the Court, although the disposing of them was within, yet the Court had no
jurisdiction of the cause. To which Roll chief Justice agreed, Trover.
and said, if the Action had been a Trover and Conversion if had been good, but
being a Trespass vi et armis it is naught, and therefore let the Indgement be
reversed, nisi.

Cottrell and his Wife against Theoballs.
Hill. 1651. Banc. sup.
THis case was again moved, and spoken unto by Turner, Judgment prayed in an
Action upon a promise.
who prayed judgment for the Plaintiff, because, as he conceived, the Action was
well brought by the Husband and Wife, and to prove it he cited these books, 39
H. 6. f. 45.9. H. 6. f. 4. Not. Brev. 131.28 H. 8. Dyer f. 21. Pasch. 5 Car.
Brown and Floyds case, Pasc. 13 Car. Oldhams case, and said, That the
consideration here did move from both parties, and not from the Husband only.
2ly. It is not necessary to give the Defendant notice that his wife had
attained to the age of 18 years, at which time he was to pay the money, for he
might take notice of it himself. Latch on the other side prayed that the
Judgment might be arrested, because the promise was made to the Husband only,
that he would make good the Legacy given to his wife by her Father, and give 40
l. more to the Baron and Feme, and the Husband is only to have the benefit of
the promise, and the consideration, namely the marriage, moved only from the
Husband, and therefore the Action is to be brought by the Husband only, and not
by the Husband and his wife, and this promise is not like a promise made to a
servant to pay money to the use of his Master, and it is not here laid that the
promise was made to both, as it might have been, and it is not reasonable to
turn over the wives portion, for which the Husband has made her a jointure
unto the Feme; for if it should have been so, the wife might have released it
before the marriage, and the Case cited of Rippon and Norton was otherwise laid,
37 Eliz. Banc. Reg. 2ly. Here ought to be notice given when the Feme came to
her age of 18 years; for here the Assumpsit is to make good a Legacy, which was
to be paid to her at such an age, and he ought to give notice of her age as he
ought to an Executor, and this case is not like as where one binds himself in
an Obligation to pay another such a sum when he comes to such an age, and the
legacy here is to be made good in that manner as the Executor is to pay it.
Roll chief Justice said, that the party is not bound to give notice, Notice.
but the other must take notice at his peril. But the promise is here laid to
be made to the Husband only, and though the money is to be paid to does, yet it
would be inconvenient to entitle the Feme to it, and here it was the folly of
the Husband to join his wife in the Action, for he might have brought it alone
if he would. Iovning in Action.
for he has alleged that the promise was made to him alone, and therefore the
Action is not well brought; and it appears by the Declaration that the Feme was
of age before the marriage, and so the notice is out of Doors: The rest of the
Judges agreed with Roll chief Justice in all, and so the Court ruled a nil
capiat per Billam nisi. Antea.

conclude ad commune nocumentum, but ad grave damnum, which shows it to be no

made himself no title to the watercourse, and therefore let the Endictment be

Comport against Beech.
Hill. 1651. Banc. sup.
THe Court was moved on the Defendants behalf, For a reference touching a

That he was a very poor man, and in making of a Ditch for another man, he had
unwillingly committed a Trespass against the Plaintiff, in taking away 2 or 3
wheele-barroughs of Earth of the Plaintifs soil, and therefore it was prayed
that the matter might be referred to the Secondary to tax the damages and Costs
for the Trespass, which he was ready to pay, and that the proceedings might be

Action. Reference.


Hele against Green.
Hill. 1651. Banc. sup.
IN an Ejectione firmae a special Verdict was found, upon which the Case fell
out to be this, A man being Lessee of a Manor for 199 years, Special Verdict in
an Ejectione firmae.
devises the Term to his wife for life, with power to make such estates in as
ample manner as he himself might have done, during her life, and the remainder
in Tall to his Daughter, and dies, the Feme proves the Will and accepts of the
Legacy, and after makes a Lease for 99 years, and dies, and the daughter brings
an Ejectione firmae against the Lessee of the Feme. The question was, whether
this Lease made by the Feme were a good Lease or not. Merifield argued, that
the Lease was not good after the death of the Feme, because she having but an
estate for life, Lease.
and the Lease for 99 years being derived out of it, when the estate for life
ends, the estate derived out of it must end also. And 2ly. If the Feme had any
power to dispose of any part of the Term longer than for her life, by the same
reason she might have disposed of all of it, which cannot be intended; for the
Testator did not mean that she should have power to destroy the Entayl made
upon his Daughter. And as to the Objection that she has dissposed of but part
of the Term, and therefore has not destroyed the Entayl: I answer, It matters
not what she has done, but what she might have done, for by the same reason
that she disposed of part she might have disposed of the whole; The rest of the
Argument I could not hear. Henage Finch on the other side argued, That the
Lease made by the Feme continues after her death, because the Feme had a power
given her to make such a Lease, and by virtue of that power the Lease
continues, for the power given unto her relates to the Estates to be made by
her, and not to the continuance of her life. And here the intent of the
Testator is to be considered, which was, that his wife should have the power to
dispose of all the Term if she would, for he trusted her with it, because she
was his Wife, and Mother of his Daughter, to whom the Entayl was made, and the
very subject, matter shows his intent to be so, and because there is no other
power expressed against this in any other part of the Will, and the words that
give her this power would be idle and trifling if they should receive any other
Construction, 2 Car. Banc. Reg. Danyel and Ogleys case, and Gibs and Whites
case, 1 Car. nor does the assent of the Feme to the Legacy, to have the Term
for life, destroy her power to make estates. 2ly. She has well executed this
power, for the Jury have found that it is the Lease of the Feme, 9 Iac. Suckham
and Hawkins case, a power given to an Executor may be executed by parts. Roll
chief Justice held, Lease.
the Lease was good; for a Will ought to be so interpreted, that all the parts
of it may stand together, and if the Feme here have not power to make this
Lease, the Clause of giving her this Lease is idle, and the meaning is so,
without doubt the Feme has the sole estate in Law in her, and the power given
here is but a restoring to her of that, which she had before by the Law, and
her consenting to the Legacy, does not take away her power to make Estates. And
this limited power, and the remainder to his daughter may stand together, for
it might be that the wife would not make such a lease, and then the daughter
should have had the land in tail; but if she dispose of it the daughter shall
not have it. Ierman as Roll. Nicholas Justice held, that the Feme could only
dispose of the land during her life and that the Testators intent by the words
was, that the Feme should not be tied to occupy the lands her self during her
life; but might dispose of them. Ask as Nicholas, that she can dispose of the
lands only during her life, for the power is only given during her life, and
this interpetation will make all parts of the Will stand together, better than
the other interpretation. Adjourned. Antea.

Dekins against Latham.
Hill. 1651. Banc. sup.
Entered Hill. 22 Car. rot. 946.
IN an ejectione firmae a special verdict was found, Special verdict in an
ejectione firmae.
upon which the Case fell out to be this. One seized of lands covenanted to
levy a fine to the use of himself, and his wife for life, and after he leased
the lands for 21 years, for 3 l. rent per annum by equal portions, and after
the death of I.S. to pay a gross sum of 125 l. by way of fine, payable by 5 l.
a year quarterly, with a proviso in the Indenture, that for default of payment
of the rent or fine, or for want of reparations, it should be lawful for the
Lessor to re-enter. After the Lessor levyes a fine, and assigns over his
interest in the reversion. The question here was, whether the condition of
entry be transferred over to the Assignee, by the transferring over of the
reversion, Hales of council with the Plaintiff held that the lease proceeds
from the Husband only, and not from the Baron and Feme, and the condition is
transferred over, for the condition runs jointly as well to the fine reserved,
as to the rent, and is as it were a several condition in Law, although it be
comprised but in one clause, and not several clauses, and the condition as to
the rent is transferred, though not as to the fine. In 19 E 4. f. 7. The law
makes a several distribution of one praecipe, and so may it do here of one
condition, and Rawlins case in the ^ rep. cited against this comes not to this
case, for there the question was of the suspension of a condition; but here it
is of the transferring over of a condition. 2ly. If it be but one condition,
yet it is well transferred by the Statute of 32 H. 8. C. ^4. an extinguishment
in part, is not extinguishment of all, although a suspension of part be a
suspension of all, and the Grantee of the reversion shall have advantage of the
condition, because 1. He is within the words of the condition as to the
condition. 2ly. The clause of re-entry is within the words of the Statute; and
Knights case objected comes not to this case, for there was a grant but of part
of the reversion of the land, which case comes not within the Statute, for the
Grantor cannot have advantage by the Statute, where he grants but part of the
reversion, and it is not literally without the Statute, and therefore it is
within the equity of it, otherwise it would be mischievous to the Grantor, and
here is no disadvantage to the Lessee by the transferring of the condition, for
the same Statute that gives benefit of the condition, gives benefit of the
Covenants, and the Grantee of a reversion shall have benefit of a Covenant to
be transferred, although they are entire in words at the beginning, and has
one common conclusion. Wild of Council on the other side, held the condition to
be entire, according to Rawlins case, and goes to payment of the rent, and the
fine, and reparations also, and the reversion being assigned with which the
rent passes, the condition is gone also to the fine, Dyer 309. and this is a
stronger case than that to destroy the entire condition, by grant of the
reversion, 17 El. Brightmans case, C. B. The fine here is a sum collateral, and
is not incident to the reversion, and so the condition is collateral, and
cannot be apportioned, 5. rep. Spencers case, 34.8. Br. Cov. 93. 2ly. The
Statute of 32 H. 8. cannot help it for the purview of the Statute explains the
large preamble of the Statute, and shows the intent of the makers of it to be,
for forfeitures incident to lands, and reversions, and a covenant is here as
general as a condition, and the Statute extends not to a collateral covenant,
and therefore not to a condition collateral, 35 H. 6. f. 56. Condition.
and the cases put on the other side come not to our case. And as for the
mischief which may ensue by this it matters not, for it might have been
prevented by providence of the parties, and the inconveniences which may happen
to them must not alter the Law. Roll chief Justice said, if he release the
fine, the condition will not stand as to the rest, otherwise if the fine expire
by effluxion of time, or if he release the reparations the condition is gone as
to the rest, for the condition here is entire, and goes in the destruction of
the Estate, and it is the Act of the Lessor himself to assign over the
reversion, and by that all is passed away that is incident to it, and by
consequence the condition. Ierman Justice demanded, What if the Lessor shall
pay all the fine presently? Roll chief Justice answered, it may be it will
destroy the condition. Nicholas Justice said, the condition is odious in Law,
because it goes in destruction of the Estate. Adjourned to be argued again,
because held a case of consequence. At another day the case was moved again,
and argued by Latch for the Plaintiff, who made the question to be whether the
condition as it is penned may be severed or no, and said, that as it respects
the rent, it is not a condition in gross; but as it respects the fine, it is a
condition in gross, and a condition which is entire in words, may by acts of
Law receive distributions. Where the penalty of a condition is entire, there
the condition cannot be apportioned; but the condition is not so here, and
therefore may be apportioned, Dyer 30^ Knights case, ^ H. 7.6. Perkins, 162. 7.
H. 7 Kelm 60. Dyer 334. Popham in Dumports case is contrary to Dyer, Cook. Lit.
203. 2ly. It is questionable whether the Statute may help in our case, and he
said it does, for the name of rent is not altered, nor the condition attending
upon it, nor any thing done to alter the execution of the condition. 3ly. By
the assignment there is no injury done to the Lessee, for by it here is a
freeing of a thing to be done, and the Statute is a favorable Statute, and to
be extended with indifferency. Finch on the other side argued much to the same
effect as he did formerly. Roll chief Justice said, it is not necessary for the
party to express how the condition relates to all, viz. the re-entry for non
payment of the rent, and of the fine, and for not repairing, and he said a man
cannot by his own Act divide a condition, for we must keep the rule of law,
which is, not to divide a condition, which goes in destruction of an Estate,
and this case is not within the Statute of 32 H. 8. All the rest of the Judges
concurred with Roll, and so the rule was judicium pro defendente, nisi.

that as to the other he had drawn a pint of wine without license, and upon
this, Judgment was given against him that was found culpable, It was
questioned whether this were a good judgment. But Roll chief Justice concluded
it was a good Judgment, and cited many cases adjudged in point to prove it,
and one in particular in an action upon the Statute for dying with Logwood, and
he took a difference between an action grounded upon a joint contract, or a
joint trespass, and an Action brought jointly upon a Statute against two, or
for a tort done by two, as this is upon the Statute. In the first case
Judgment cannot be given against one of the contractors, in the other it may.

A Writ of error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in an Action upon the
case against two Executors, Error to reverse a judgment in an action on the

and the error assigned was a matter in fact, viz. that one of the Defendants
was within age at the time of the Action brought, and did appear, and plead by
his Attorney, whereas he ought to have done it by his guardian. Twisden for the
Defendant in the writ of Error said, that it is not all one to appear within
age in his own right, and in another right, for where he appears in his own
right, he ought to appear by his guardian; but where he appears in auter droit,
as he does here being an Executor, he may appear by Attorney, and cited
Draytons case 9 Car. Appearance.
But Roll chief Justice denied the difference, and said, it may be that the
Executor may be charged of his proper goods, as in case he have wasted the
Testators goods, and then it is not reason but he should plead by his guardian,
and he is not within the Statute of 21 Iac. for that Statute was made for the
Plaintiff, and this is in case of a Defendant, therefore he should have
appeared by his guardian, and therefore let the Judgment be reversed, nisi.

so put out of possession, and others. Windham on the other side by way of
answer said, that the party came into the land by virtue of an eign Judgment,

CRosthwayt brought an Action upon the Statute of Winchester of robberyes,

against the Hundred of Lowdon, for being robbed of 160 l. and had a verdict
against the Hundred. It was moved in arrest of Judgment, that the Action upon
the Statute, did not lie for the party that brought it, for it appears that he
was not robbed; but that the money was taken out of a portmantle, which was
carried by the postboy, and that only the Plaintiffs hand was upon one end of
the portmantle, so that the post-boy was robbed, and not the Plaintiff. But
Roll chief Justice answered, Robbery. Possession.
there is no question but that this was a robbery of the Plaintiff, and it is
all one as where my Servant is robbed in my presence, and there the goods shall
be said to be in my possession, and so is it here, and therefore let Judgment

Hill. 1651 Banc. sup.
THis case formerly argued at the Bar, and broken on the Bench, Special Verdict
upon the words of a will.
and some opinion delivered in it, was again moved by Maynard, and argued by
him. And he said that by the Will no land passes, because lands are not
mentioned in it, neither is there any necessary implication, that the Testator
intended to devise his lands, for the making one his Heir, and enjoining him to
pay an annuity does not convey the lands to him, and the Will does not say that
he makes him his Heir of his lands, but generally his Heir, which by the civil
Law may be of goods; and for the enjoining him to pay the annuity, this may be
out of other lands in consideration of the personal estate given unto him. In
Danyel and Vblies case, a gift made by a Feme coparcener of her purparty of
land, did not convey the lands in Fee. In Marshes case, the Father gave his
lands to his two Sons to be equally divided, it was adjudged there, that only
an Estate for life passed, and here is nothing at all expressly given. In
Gilbert and Withers case, Mich. 20 Iac. It was adjudged that there ought not to
be made such a construction of a Will, as is not agreeable to Law. And this is
only a logical Will by way of argument, and not a grammatical, Construction or
Interpretation.
and positive Will. Roll chief Justice answered, to make a construction of a
Will where the intent of the Testator cannot be known, is intentio caeca and
sicca; but here although the words of the Will be not proper, yet we may
collect the Testators meaning to be, by making of the party his Heir, that he
should have his lands, and it is all one as if he had said Heir of his lands,
and here he not only makes him his Heir, but his Executor also, Will.
and therefore if he shall not have his lands, the word Heir is merely
nugatory, and to no purpose, for by being Executor only, he shall have the
goods, and as it has been observed, he is in this case haeres factus, though
not natus. Ierman Justice to the same effect, and said that the word Heir
implies two things. 1. That he shall have the lands. 2ly. That he shall have
them in Fee simple. Nicholas and Ask Justices concurred, and so it was ruled
that Judgment should be given for Sir John Bridges the Devisee, nisi.

Upon a special verdict found in an ejectione firmae, Special verdict in an

the case fell out to be this, Tenant for life, the remainder to Baron and
Feme, and their Heirs, Baron and Feme suffer a recovery, The question was,
whether the Heirs of the Feme were bound by this recovery, because the Feme
being covert it was conceived she was not Tenant to the praecipe, because it
appears not she was examined, and so nothing was recovered from her. It was
argued that this recovery did bind the Feme. 1. because if a precipe be brought
against one who has nothing in the land, the writ only is abatable, Fitz. Tit.

by a Common recovery, and this has been the continual practice since that
time; and whereas it is objected, that a colorable recovery does not bind a
Feme Covert, it is answered, that this is not a colorable recovery, but a
judicial matter of Record, and is brought upon an original, and there is an
intended recompense to the Feme, and to urge that there is no Tenant to the
praecipe, is an objection which reaches to the common practice of assurances,
and therefore not to be admitted, and in time they might have counterpleaded
the voucher; but now they cannot avert this matter against the Record, 19 E. 3.

recovery, though in a fine it is otherwise, where there is no recompense in

questioned whether a recovery bind a Feme, Recovery, Examination, Averment.
for it is the Common practice. 2ly. It is not necessary to examine a Feme
Covert upon suffering a recovery, although it be a prudentiall thing to do it;
but if it be not done, it is not averrable that it was not done; but the single
question material here, is whether the Feme be Tenant to the praecipe or not,
Feme Covert
so that she shall be estopped to speak against the recovery, and he held she
was estopped, for she joins in the recovery with her Husband, and here is no
default made by the Baron, and now the record is perfect, and a thing contrary
to it ought not to be averred against it; but before the Record was perfect she
might have pleaded, Plea.
and the recompense in value here shall go to the Heirs of the Feme, and the
Tenant for life is also bound by this recovery, and the Feme is party, and also
privy to the recovery, Party and privy.
and therefore if it will bind her, it will bind her Heirs also. If a stranger
had been Tenant to the praecipe, and the Baron and Feme had been vouched, the
Feme had been bound, and this is a stronger case, and this case may concern
many men's estates, and therefore such recoveries are not to be questioned.
Therefore let the Plaintiff have his Judgment, nisi.

IN an Audita querela the Case was this, Where an Audita querela lies for the
Bail upon an erroneous judgment against the principal.
An Action of Debt was brought against the Principal, and a judgment upon a
nihil dicit obtained, but no capias ad satisfaciendum issued forth against him;
Afterward 2 scire facias were taken out against the Bail, and 2 n^chils
thereupon returned, and thereupon judgment was given against the Bail, who
thereupon brings his Audita querela. The Question was, whether the Audita
querela did lie or not, in regard that the scire facias issued forth against
the Bail before any capias ad satisfaciendum was taken forth upon the
judgment, upon the nihil dicit against the Principal. Green of Council with
the Defendant held, that the Audita querela did not lie, because that the party
has other remedy to relieve himself, and therefore the Audita querela lies
not, for that is given only where the other party has no other remedy, 21 E.
3. f. 12. Brook Audita quer. 18. And besides here are two nichils returned
against the party, which do amount to a scire feci, and so the party is warned,
and therefore he comes now too late to have his Audita querela, for here is as
much as a judgment by default after an appearance, and here is no release, and
there is a judgment executed and in force, and not reversed by the Principal,
Green and Le Grices case, Pasch. 39. Sir Francis Mores Reports. Wild for the
Plaintiff held, that the Audita querela did well lie, because that no scire
facias ought to have issued against the Bail, before a capias ad satisfaciendum
taken forth against the Principal: And an Audita querela is in the nature of a
suit in Chancery, and the party comes soon enough here to be relieved, though
the scire facias be returned, for the return thereof shall not bar him from his
Audita querela, although it be now too late for him to reverse the judgment by
a writ of Error, and the books 21 E. 3.13. and Kelw. 23, 24. are in the very
point. And the party by the return of the 2 nichils is not in Court; And in
Mores Reports, in Hobs and Todcasters case 38 Eliz. it is adjudged that an
Audita querela does lie. Roll chief Justice, when one is Bail in the Common
Pleas, he is bound to bring in the body of the Principal, Bail.
or to pay the debt: And Pomeroys case is, that until a Capias be returned
against the Principal the Bail cannot forfeit his Recognisance, Recognisance.
Forfeiture.
for the nonappearance of the Principal, for the filing of the Capias is not
sufficient, but it must be returned. And this was the ancient course there, and
the Law so held to be; but by usage of later times and out of indulgence showed
to the Bail it has been held sufficient for the Bail to bring in the principal
after the retorn of the Capias, and now at this day, out of greater indulgence
afforded unto the Bail, it is well enough if the Bail bring in the Principal at
any time before the return of the second scire facias, but after it is
returned, then it is too late for him to bring him in, Error.
and that is the reason that in such Case a writ of Error lies not for the Bail
to reverse the judgment against the Principal. If a scire facias be brought
against the Bail, and he pleads that the Principal dyed before the return of
the Capias against him, it is adjudged to be a good plea for the Bail to
discharge himself; Plea.
but to plead he dyed after the return, is not good: And it is a good plea for
the Bail in a scire facias brought against him to say, that no capias was
returned against the Principal; And here is a good discharge in Law against the
Bail. But the question here is, whether the return of the two Nichils be not a
Bar to him now, and that he has not thereby lost his advantage to bring his
Audita querela, Audita querela.
because by the return thereof the party is supposed to have notice, and
therefore a writ of Error clearly lies not to reverse this judgment, though it
be upon a nihil dicit. And as to that, in as much as the party has no other
remedy to help himself, and it is apparent that he is damnified by an undue
judgment, it is reason he should bring his Audita querela. Barns and Corbets
case. The Bail cannot say the Principal has paid the money, if he have not an
acquittance or matter of Record to prove it; and in Sir John Mounsons case upon
two nichils returned adjudged, that the party might have his Audita querela,
and therefore the Plaintiff ought to have his Judgment. Ierman Justice
dissented. But Nicholas Justice, absente Ask, agreed with Roll and said, that
for want of the return of the Capias the judgment was erroneous, and the 2
scire facias might be returned behind the parties back, and therefore it could
not be said to be all one, as if the party had appeared, for if he had appeared
the Case would have been otherwise, So Judgment was given for the Plaintiff,

IN an Ejectione firmae upon a Lease for years of a Message, Special verdict
in Trespass and Ejectrue^^.
and certain lands in Hatfield Broad-Oak in the County of Essex, upon a special
verdict found the case fell out to be this, Rich. Frank seized amongst other
lands and Tenements of the Message and lands in question, upon the marriage of
his Son Leventhorp Frank with Susan. Cotele, levies a fine of the lands to the
use of himself during his own life, and the life of Leventhorp his Son, and
after during the life of Susanna Cotele the wife of Leventhorp, the remainder
to the use of the heirs to be begotten upon the body of Susanna by Leventhorp
her Husband. The question here was, whether the word heirs shall be intended
the heirs of Leventhorp and Susanna his wife, or whether the estate shall be
intended to be limited to the heirs of Susanna only, and that Leventhorp shall
have barely an estate for life in the lands. Sergeant Glyn of Council with the
Plaintiff held, That Susanna Cotele has an estate tail executed in the lands,
and that the word heirs shall relate only to the heirs of Susanna, and not to
the heirs of Leventhorp, 1. Because that here is an estate limited for life
unto Susanna by an express limitation, and her heirs shall take immediately
after the estate for life ended, and they shall not come in as purchasors. By
express Terms the word heirs is not limited to any person, but it is left to
the construction of the Law, and that does apply it to Susanna, as to a person
to whom Richard that settled the lands has expressed most affection, as appears
by the Deed, Lit. f. 6. Sect. 28. There is an expression of the party to whom
the word heirs shall relate, but so is not here, and therefore the cases
differ. In 3 Ed. 3. f. 31, 32. It is ruled that both parties have an estate
tail, because the estate is limited to both, but so it is not in our case, so
those books are not against me. In our case, it does not appear that Richard
did intend to advance the Husband of Susanna, and therefore it is not reason
that the word heirs should relate to him, but to Susanna his wife only, for in
case of limitation of estates the intention of the party is to be considered,
and does direct the matter, and the preceding limiting of the estate to
Susanna, and not to Leventhorp, does show that the party did mean to promote
the heirs of Susanna. Lit. Sect. 27. Dyer 27. A second reason is drawn from the
penning of the deed, which in the limitation of it does incline more, that the
word heirs should be applied to Susanna than to Leventhorp; for the words upon
her is as much as to say of her, and then it is the same case with Littletons
case. 3ly. The Intention of the Donor appears to be such by the circumstances
of the entire limitations, which do show that he did intend that Leventhorp
should not have such an estate whereby it should be in his power to deprive his
issue, and therefore the word heirs are to be applied to Susanna, and not to
Leventhorp; for if it should be applied to both, then Leventhorp might destroy
the estate of the issue, contrary to the Donors intent; And whereas Dyer 99 is
objected against me. I answer, that case is not against me, for there the word
heirs is expressly limited to a certain person, viz. to the heirs of the body of
both of them, but so it is not in our case; and whereas Hill. 13 Iac. Lane and
Panels case in this Court is also objected against me, I answer, that that case
is in effect the same case with Dyer, and the question in our case came not in
dispute. And the will of the Donor in deeds is to be ohserved. Lit. 22. C.
Tail. 1. rep. Shelleys case 103. (...) Notwithstanding in gifts in tail this
rule holds not, so that a gift in tail may be limsted contrary to the rule of
the Common Law. And I know not of any authority in print, or writing against
me; but in 13 Ed. 3. Fitz. tit. variance 81, there is an express authority for
me, and 4 H. 4. Fitz. br. 448. and in my experience I have known many estates
limited as this is in the Southern parts, and held good estates tail, and if it
should be otherwise, many estates would be shaken. Roll chief Justice. We have
delivered our opinions before, against you, viz. that it was not the meaning of
the donour, to apply the word Heirs to the body of Susanna only, for this
construction would offer violence unto the words, as appears by Littleton, who
interprets that they are to be applied to the Heirs of both the parties, and
your reason is founded upon a wrong ground, and expressly against Litletons
case; and for your second reason it is of no weight, for the words are all one
as if he had said to the Heirs of the Husband and wife begotten upon the wife.
3ly. We are not to frame a meaning against plain words, which show the Donors
intent to be against you. And the Baron cannot Bar the Estate tail as you
suppose, Tail.
for the Feme has an Estate for life, and if she survive she may revive the
remaining Estate, and we must not consider of inconveniences, which possibly
may happen against the express words of the deed, and the multitude of
conveyances made in this manner, are of no force to alter the Law. Ierman
Justice as Roll. That the word Heirs shall be applied to the Heirs of both
parties, because voluntas donatoris secundum formam chartae expressa est
observanda. Nicholas and Ask Justices of the same opinion.

recover his debt of the lands descended, upon this Judge meant a writ of Error
was brought here, and the Error assigned was, that the Judgment ought to have
been given generally against the Defendant, and not particularly of the lands
descended. 2ly the Jury ought not to have found what lands particularly the
Heir had by descent; but generally that he had lands by descent, because the
issue is general, whether he had lands by descent or not, and therefore the
Judgment given upon this ill verdict is not good. Roll chief Justice, The

A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment in an Action of Trespass,

for the Declaration is for the taking away of quoddam instrumentum ferri,
Anglice a gridiron, et quoddam instrumentum ferri Anglice a mortar et quaedam
instrumenta ferri Anglice brandirons, which are words utterly uncertain for the
generality of them, what they may signify. Roll chief Justice, My Judgment is
that the Judgment is erroneous, for we must not take meanings; because we are
bound up to proceed by the rules of the Law, and Statutes, and we are to
consider here whether there be Latin words in the Declaration, as there ought
to be to express the things, for which the Action is brought, and certainly
this word quoddam instrumentum ferri is too general to express any thing, and
the Anglice added to it will not help it; for if the word precedent, in it
self, be not fit Latin to express the thing the Anglice subsequent is little to
be regarded, Anglice. Declaration.
and these words being uncertain the Declaration must be uncertain, and so the
Defendant cannot know what to answer to it, or how to defend himself as he
ought to do, which may prove very prejudicial to him. Ierman Justice, Issue.
The issue cannot be certain, if the Declaration be uncertain, and by the
Common Law and Statute Law our pleadings must be Latin, and where there are not
elegant Latin words to express things, we may use those which they call
barbarous words, if they be known, for use makes a language, and where there
are no Latin words, we may coin words, and add an Anglice to them, and here the
Declaration is as uncertain also, for the number of the things, as for the
nature of them, for here is quaedam instrumenta ferri, which may signify any
number be it more or less, Nicholas and Ask ad idem. And so the Judgment was

A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in a writ of dower in

the Errors assigned were, that the Judges of the Common Pleas had set a side
the verdict given by default by the Judge of assise, because it ought not to
have been taken, but a petite cape of the lans awarded, whereas though this was
a fault in the Judge to take the verdict, yet this is to be amended by a writ
of Error, for the Judge of assise, and the Judges of the Common pleas in this
case are but as one Judge, Dyer f. 194. f. 76. and here is a waiver of the
default, because the enquest was taken at the prayer of the party, 27 H. 8. f.

or implicitly, 3 H. 6. f. 48. 10 H. 7. f. 21. 3ly. Here is a discontinuance

by the Judges taking advice is out of the Court, 7 H. 4. f. 14. pl. 13. Here is
day given in Court to the Demandant, but not to the Tenant, and the Judges
cannot advise afterward. And here the judgment is given upon a default after a
default, whereas the 2d. default was the same day with the 1. and not at
another day, as it ought to have been. Hales on the other side held that the
judgment was not erroneous, for here is no judgment, but only an awarding of
the Enquest, and if it be not good, it is done by those that had no power to
do it, and so not material, and the Judges of the Common place have a distinct
authority from the Judge of the nisi prius. 2ly. Here is no release of the
default nor Enquest, nor can the Judge of the nisi prius take a release of the
Default; for by awarding the default the power of the Judge of the nisi prius
is determined: And the release ought to be of the default, upon which the
judgment should be given, and it is not so here. Next here is no
discontinuance, for it is not necessary to give day to the Tenant by the Curia
advisare vult, for then there could be no petite Cape; And the judgment here
is good, for there is no other day of default. Roll chief Justice, Verdict by
default. Petit Cape.
The Judge ought to have called the Tenant, or to award a petite Cape of the
land, and not to have taken the Enquest by default; but here the Judge of
Assize did not award a petite Cape. For the 1 Exception, The Judge of the nisi
prius had no authority to take the verdict, and so that is done coram non
judice, and so the nullo habito respectu to the Enquest by the Judges of the
Common Pleas is good enough, Error.
and so they may in that Court award a petite Cape, and they may also advise,
and there is no need for them to give a day of continuance to the party, for
that were to take away that of which they would advise, and the ad alium diem
is also good, and so there is no Error in the judgment. Affirmetur nisi.

only, yet the money recovered shall be distributed as the Statute directs. Roll
chief Justice, The King may be better trusted than a Common Informer; So the
Case is not alike, where the King brings the Action, as where the Informer
brings it, for the King may receive all the money, and the Informer may have
his part by Petition to the King, and here neither the Information nor the
Verdict is pursued, for that is tam pro Domino Rege quam pro seipso, etc. and
here the Judgment is only for the Informer. Judgment.
The King may if he will, sue alone and have Judgment for all, if he begin his
suit before the Informer, but if he begin it afterward, the Informer shall
have his part. And if the King do inform tam pro seipso, as for the College,
there the College shall have its part. For these reasons the Judgment is not
good, Therefore let it be reversed, nisi.

A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given in an Action of
Trespass upon the Case in the Court at Burton upon Trent, Error to reverse a
judgment in an Action upon a promise.
wherein the Plaintiff declared, that the Defendant, in consideration that he
was indebted unto the Plaintiff in 20 l. did assume and promise to deliver
diverse Cattle to I. S. to the use of the Plaintiff, and for non performance of
this promise he brought his Action, and had a Verdict and a Judgment. But the
Judgment was reversed, because the Court held that here is no consideration
expressed which can relate to the discharging of the debt of 20 l. and so the
promise is but nudum pactum, Consideration. Nu^um p^ctum.
and the Plaintiff is, notwithstanding the promise, at liberty to bring his
Action against the Defendant for the money.

Child against Sir John Lenthall.
Trin. 1652. Banc. sup.
AN Action of Escape was brought against Sir John Lenthall as Mareschall of
this Court, Arrest of Judgment in an Action for an escape.
wherein the Plaintiff declared, that whereas I. S. was indebted unto him by
Obligation in a certain sum of money, and was thereupon by a latitat out of
this Court arrested, and did thereupon put in Bail, and did appear to the
Action, and the Plaintiff obtained a judgment against him, who thereupon in
discharge of his Bail did render himself to Sir John Lenthall in Execution, and
that afterward Sir John Lenthall had suffered him to escape, per quod, etc. to
this Declaration Sir John Lenthall pleaded, and a Verdict was had against him.
Wild in Arrest of Judgment takes these Exceptions to the Declaration. 1. It
says that the Principal rendered himself in Execution to discharge his Bail,
and says, that afterward he escaped, whereby he could not have him in
Execution, which seems contradictory to what he formerly said. 2ly. He says
that he rendered himself to the Mareschall, whereas he ought to say that he
rendered himself to the Court; for it is the Act of the Court that turns him
over to the Marshall. Roll chief Justice, He cannot render himself to Sir John
Lenthal in discharge of his Bail; Bail.
for only a Judge can take and discharge a Bail, and not Sir John Lenthall; but
here it is that he did it in Court, and therefore it is well enough; for he may
render himself to Sir John Lenthall in Court, though out of Court he cannot,
and therefore let the Plaintiff have his Judgment.

IN an Action of Trover and Conversion for 3 Cart loads of Dats, Arguments upon
a Demurrer to a Plea to the jurisdiction of this Court.
Barlie and Pease. The Defendant pleaded a special Plea to this effect. That
the land where the Trover was supposed to be is 5 acres of land lying in B. and
that is within the County Palatine of Chester and that he holds the land for
term of years, and by virtue thereof did sow and take the Corn thereupon
growing, and traverseth the Conversion out of the County Palatine, and avers
that there are Courts of Justice held within the County Palatine, so that
Justice may there be had, and says, that he ought to be sued within the County
Palatine, and not elsewhere, and therefore demands Judgment if he ought to be
sued in this Court. To this plea the Plaintiff demurred, and showed for cause,
that the Action being for a transitory matter, it may be tried out of the
County Palatine as well as within, although if it were for a local matter it
would be otherwise, and the party here has pleaded not guilty, which may be
tried any where, Cooks Instit. 282. In some Cases an Obligation hearing date at
Chester may be sued in another place, 19 E. 3. Fitz. Oar. 29.45 Ed. 3. Fitz.

E. 3. f. 17. And so it was prayed the Defendant might plead over. Sergeant Glyn
on the other side held, that this plea was a good plea to the Jurisdiction of
the Court. Here are many matters of fact confessed, and the matter in Law is,
whether the title of the land within Chester shall be tried out of that
jurisdiction. In 31 Ed. 1. in the Exchequer it is clear they have conusance of
Pleas. Roll chief Justice to that answered, but it is not that they shall not
be removed thence; Sergeant Glyn proceeded and said, that also upon a reference
to 4 Judges by Queen Elizabeth, it was certified, that all Actions real and
personal arising in Chester are tryable there, and not elsewhere, 22 E. 4.

1. I deny the authority of Cook in his 4 Institutes cited on the other side.
Next the Action here by the pleading of it is made real, and then though Cooks
opinion should be Law, it comes not home to our case, and a transitory action
may be made real by the pleading of it, 27 H. 6. f. 1. Hill. 38 Eliz. Banc.
sup. Hill. 2 Car. in Belamy and Bolthorps case in this Court, 6 rep. 14. A
thing is tryable there where the best conusance of it may be had, 6 H. 7. 3
2ly. The averment of the party here is, that all actions personal and real
within Chester are tryable there, and this being matter of fact is confessed by
the Demurrer, 9 H. 7. Porter and Nicholls in the Exchequer 10 Car. And it would
be a great inconvensence to try the title of lands lying within Chester out of
it, for so all causes real may as well be tried in foreign Counties, even
through all England, which would be very mischievous. Roll chief Justice,
Trial.
If we can avoid it, it is not good to try causes in foreign Counties; but here
you have by your demurrer confessed, that all causes real and personal shall be
tried there, and what say you to that? 2ly. Traverse. Waiver. Issue.
It is to be considered whether your Traverse be not repugnant to your Plea,
for you have waived the plea to the jurisdiction of the Court, and put your
self upon an issue by the traverse, which you ought not to have done; but you
ought to have relied upon your plea to the jurisdiction of the Court, for as
the traverse is taken, until a trial be had in the cause, we cannot tell
whether the Trover and Conversion be within the County Palatine, or out of it,
and this is matter of substance, and tryable, and therefore it would be hard to
maintain your plea. At another day the case was argued again, and first by
Twisden for the Plaintiff, and he took three things into consideration. 1.
Whether the plea were a mere plea to the jurisdiction. 2ly. Whether it be made
good by the demurrer. 3ly. Whether the traverse have not spoiled the plea. 1.
He held the plea was not good, because the Action is merely transitory, and may
be laid in any place, 2. Mar. Br. traverse 983. Cooks Lit. f. 202. and the
Defendant cannot plead that the cause of Action lies in any other place, than
where the Plaintiff lays it, Cooks Iurisd. of Courts is full authority in
point, what ever is objected against it, 30 H. 6. f. 6. I admit of the
jurisdiction of the County Palatine; but yet it must not entrench upon the
Common Law, and I admit all the books cited; but they are of other local
matters, or of things transitory, which are fixed to Chester by the pleading of
them, and Dyer 122 comes not to our case, nor crosses the case of 10. Iac. 3.
rep. Ridgwayes case, and here it shall be intended that the Jury may there have
best conusance of the matter where the Action is laid, and not elsewhere,
although the Action do savor of the Land. For the second matter the demurrer
makes not the plea good, for the law says it is not good, and the parties
cannot alter the Law, Burtons case. 5. rep. f. 59. 5 H. 7.1. 3ly. The traverse
makes not the plea good, for the traverse is waived, and he relyes upon another
matter, 5. Car. rot. 817. Burton and Cornish, the traverse taken, took away the
justification before pleaded, so does it here, and the traverse here is not
good, because it is in a transitory matter. Where one justifies a thing done,
it ought to be confessed that he did it, so if he traverse that he has not
done a thing here, it implies it is done some where else. Latch for the
Defendant made this question, whether upon the matter as it is here pleaded,
the jurisdiction of this Court be taken away, and he held it is. It is the
honor of this court to imaintain the jurisdiction of all other Courts and
therefore I hope, it is not misbeseeming me to put it in mind of this honor
that belongs to it, I believe that according to the ancient Law of the land,
actions ought not to be laid elsewhere, then where the matter that caused them
did arise, although that now by custom it is grown otherwise. Although the
Plaintiff may fix a transitory Action, where he pleases in ordinary matters,
yet he cannot do it where the matter arises within a special jurisdiction, as
the case here is. It is not a good allegation that binds up the jurisdiction of
this Court, except where it appears that the allegation is true, and the
allegation here may well stand with law, it being in the Case of a County
Palatine, which has such a jurisdiction incident to it, and this Court Ex
Officio ought to take notice of the Jurisdiction of the County Palatine and
that they have authority to hold pleas, 45 Ed. 3. f. 10. 50 E. 3. pl. 1^. 10 H.
6.16. The averment is, that the party remains within the jurisdiction of
Chester, that there may not be intended to be a failer of justice, by the
parties going out of the Jurisdiction where the offense was done, 44 and 45
Eliz. Crisp and De^^^. Neither is the plea by the traverse become so vicious,
as to retain the Jurisdiction of this Court thereby; For the County Palatine
cannot give up their jurisdiction to this Court, as ancient Demesne Courts, and
other Courts may by the mispleading of the parties, for their pleading is coram
non judice, 10 H. 6.13. b. 9 H. 7.12. 45 E. 3. f. 7. 22 E. 4.23. 31 H. 6.11.
Nor does the traverse here waive all the precedent matter, but stands with it
although it be made narrower by it; but nothing is here waived, Dyer 165 Here
is an issue in substance, which is good, although not in the letter, and the
straightning of it shall not hurt, and the Court is neither inveigled, nor the
party wronged by it, Dyer 369 Hob. 119. This traverse binds not the other party
to join issue upon it; but there may be a traverse upon a traverse, and he may
plead another plea, Hob. 18. New man's case. Roll chief Justice, In your
prescription you have averred that he was an inhabitant; but you have not
averred that they ought to hold plea of transitory matters, if the party
inhabit out of the jurisdiction, and here the party ought to be summoned, and
if he dwell out of the jurisdiction, what remedy can be had against him then,
for how can he be summoned? And we cannot judge of the jurisdiction; but by
your pleading, Trial.
and by your traverse you have tripped up your own heels. The reason why
transitory actions may be laid in any County is, because that otherwise justice
might fail, for the party may do a fact in one County, and then remove to
another, so here the party may do wrong within the County Palatine, and then go
out of it to avoid justice. At another day Wild argued for the Plaintiff, and
Shafto for the Defenddant. Wild held that the plea was ill, 1. In the
inducement 2ly. It is ill in the substance of it, 3ly. The traverse is not
good. The inducement is ill, because it does not confess a conversion; but here
is a general issue only pleaded, 9 E. 4.5. 12 E. 4.12. It is ill in the
substance, because the usage pleaded is against Law, and will cause a failer of
justice, which ought not to be, for the Law leaves no person wronged without a
remedy, 19 E. 3.29. Fitz. Iurisdict. 50 E. 3. pl. 1^. 44. 45 Eliz. Crisp and
Verols case, 2 R. 3.4. Harid and Paytons case. 24 Car. 48.2. instit. 4. Cook
jurisdict. 213. 14 E. 4.25. Next the traverse has waived all the matter
pleaded before, and because the plea was good before, there was no necessity to
take it, 20 E. 4.2. and the traverse is also too straight, for it has tied up
the matter to Wellington, and so he prayed a respondes ouster. Shafto on the
other side held the plea good, and argued much to show in the jurisdiction of
the County Palatine, and cited Cook jurisdict. f. 219. 22 E. 4.34. per collow,
Dyer 156. Hill. 8 H. 7. rot. 228. and he said the plea is good, though it be
not confined to the inhabitants within Chester, for there was no necessity to
plead thus, and it had been enough to have pleaded generally, because this
Court takes notice of the jurisdiction of Chester, 11 Rich. 2. Fitz. brief. and
the pleading has always been in this manner, as may appear by the Book of
entryes, 1 E. 4. f. 11. and this custom by construction of law, is necessarily
to extend to the inhabitants within the jurisdiction, 21 H. 7.40. Dyer 46.
Rastall 128, 129. the privilege of Chester follows the persons of the
inhabitants, and so there can be no failer of justice as is objected. And for
the traverse, though it be ill, it shall do no hurt in this case to take away
the custom, for upon the entire record, it does appear that the Action lies
within the jurisdiction, and if Judgment be given here, it is coram non
judice, and so the traverse is nor material, 9 H. 7.12. 37 H. 6. f. 26. Cooks

Nicholas Justice answered the Justices of this Court are not bound to take
notice of the custom of Chester, otherwise than as it is alleged. Roll chief
Justice, The matter is whether we can take notice of your case, otherwise than
you have pleaded it, and your plea is naught, and the party may demurr upon it,
for it appears not whether the custom extends to Wellington where the trover
was, because it appears not whether Wellington lie within the County Palatine
of Chester or no, Plea.
and the Plea cannot be good in part, and ill in other part, as is supposed.
Ierman Justice, The Declaration here is good, and if the plea be not good to
answer it then it is ill. Nicholas Justice, The Plea is contrary to law and
reason, and Common sense, and there ought not to be a failer of Justice. Ask of
the same mind. Confession.
Roll chief Justice, We must take all the matter as it is pleaded, and if the
Plea be ill, the other party shall not be said to confess any thing. And here
you have pleaded a plea in Bar, viz. Not guilty, and you have also Pleaded to
the jurisdiction of this Court, which cannot be; and we are not now to examine
the jurisdiction, but the pleading. Therefore, show cause Monday next why you
shall not plead in Chief.

in an Action of Debt upon an Obligation to stand to an Award, Error to reverse

and the Errors assigned were, 1. That whereas the Award was to pay a certain
sum of money, at or before the 25 day of December, the breach assigned is, that
he paid it not at the 25 day. 2ly. Whereas there are 2 parties of one side, and
one on the other side that submitted to the Award, The Award is that one party
shall not prosecute the other. 3ly. The Condition is that the Award shall be
made the 20 day of such a month, and it is set forth that the Award was made
before the 20 day, and does not say what day it was made; But the Council
relied upon the 1 Exception; And to that Latch on the other side answered,
Award.
That if it be paid before the 25 day, it is then paid at the 25 day. 2ly. The
Condition requires the award to be made under their hands, and the subsequent
averment is to no purpose, And as to the 3. the words Alter partium extends to
all parties, and besides, the breach is not assigned upon that. Roll chief
Justice, If it be paid before the day, it is paid at the day, and so that is
certain enough. 9 H. 7. Another exception was taken, that the condition was
that the Arbitrament should be put in writing by the Arbitrators, and it is not
so here expressed, but only generally that it was put in writing. Roll chief
Just. It is not to be necessarily understood that it must be put in writing by
the Arbitrators themselves, Another Exception was taken that here is an
Outlawry after judgment, and there is a fault in the Outlawry, for in the Writ
to the Sherif it is praecipipimus vobis, instead of praecipimus vobis, and the
year of our Lord is in Figures. And 2ly. it is secundum consuetudinem regni
Angliae, whereas it was in the time of the Keepers of the Liberty of England.
Roll chief Justice, If the word be praecipipimus, then there is no command to
the Sherif, for that word signifies nothing, Therefore let the Outlawry be
reversed, and judgment affirmed.

Servant was driving his Masters Gelding in the way, being laden with Lead, and
that by reason of the hole he fell, etc. To this evidence it was demurred, and
for cause it was showed, That by the evidence it neither is proved that there
was such a way, nor what person dug the hole, both which are part of the

to find the Verdict for the Plaintiff, as the Jury have done. Roll chief
Justice, This evidence is no more than a special Verdict, and it ought to find

IN an Action upon the Case for words, the Case was this, Arrest of judgment
in an Action for words.
the Defendant being brought before a Justice of Peace to answer a crime
objected against him, the Plaintiff appeared as a witness to testiffe against
him, whereupon the Defendant to weaken his Testimony did speak these words of
the Plaintiff before the Justice of Peace, Thou have been a contentious man this
30 years, and a Breeder of strife, and have taken a false Oath against my
Brother and Sister in a matter of incontinency, and have taken 20 s. for it,
and I will show it upon Record. Upon not guilty pleaded, and a Verdict for the
Plaintiff, It was moved in Arrest of Judgment, that the words were not
actionable, because it is not said that he is perjured in any Court of Record,
but, that he will show if upon Record, And 15 Car. Morton and Clapams case was
cited; but on the other side it was said, that take all the words together they
are actionable, and Trin. 22 Car. Osborn and Brooks case was cited. Roll chief
Justice, The words are said to be spoken falso and malitiose, and it is not
said in the Record that the party spoke them in his own defense, and it may be
they were spoken by the by, and not in the judicial proceedings, but it
appeared upon reading of the Record, Case.
that they were spoken to disable the Plaintifs testimony: Whereupon Roll chief
Justice said, That the Action did as well lie in this case, as it does lie for
endicting one falso et malitiose, for Endictments are more: avoured in the Law
than private matters between parties. Therefore let the Plaintiff have his
Judgment, nisi.

Custodes against Howell Gwinn.
Trin. 1652. Banc. sup.
HOwell Gwinn was endicted of perjury, Arrest of Judgment in an Endictment for
perjury.
for taking of a false Oath in an Affidavit made before a Master of the
Chancery, and was found guilty. It was moved in Arrest of Judgment, 1. That it
does not appear by the Record that the Oath made was any thing material to the
suit depending in that Court, and so it is but an extrajudicial Oath, and is
not perjury either by the Common Law, or by the Statute. 2ly. It does not
appear that the party took a false Oath, for it appears not whether the Master
of the Chancery had any power to take this Oath, and if he had not, then it
cannot be perjury. Latch enforced the 2 Exception, and said, That a Master of
the Chancery has not power ex Officio to take an Oath, and therefore the party
ought to show that he had power to take this Oath; but if he has power he
ought not to take it upon the holy Evangelists, as it is here expressed, but it
ought to be upon the holy Evangely, for the form is super sacro sancto
Evangelio, and not Evangelistis. Maynard on the other side prayed judgment,
and that the party may be fined, and answered, that it does well appear that
the Oath was made touching the cause in question, and the Endictment is here
laid at the Common Law, and not upon the Statute. Next it is not necessary to
show that a Master of the Chancery has authority to take an Oath, for it is
the common course and practice of the Court of Chancery for the Masters to take
oaths, and the Chancery being a Court of Record here, this Court is bound to
take notice of the Customs used in it. 3ly. The taking of the Oath upon the
Holy Evangelists, and the taking of it upon the Holy Evangely is all one in
effect. Roll chief Justice, The most material Exception is, whether a Master of
the Chancery has authority ex Officio to take an Oath, and certainly antienly
he had not, and therefore you should have expressed that he had authority to
take an Oath. At another day Hales said, that it does well appear by the
Record, that the Master had authority to take the Oath of the person, Oath.
and many presidents are, as our Case is. Roll chief Justice, The Presidents
are, that he has authority to take an Oath prout per Recordum, etc. but it is
not so expressed here. Nicholas Justice, A Master of the Chancery of common
right has no power to take an Oath, and therefore in this Case you should have
pleaded precisely that he had authority, otherwise it cannot be good. Hales at
another day answered another Exception taken, that it did not appear that the
Affidavit in which the false Oath was made, was filed, and then it was not upon
Record, and so could be no perjury, and said it is all one whether the
Affidavit be filed or not, for the forswearing is before the filing, and the
party who takes the oath may choose whether he will file it or no, and
therefore it is not necessary in the pleading to say, as it appears by the
Record. Green on the same side, It may be that it was filed, and afterward
taken off from the file, and then he cannot say as it appears by the Record,
and it would be mischievous if the party should not be punish*d for the
perjury, because the Affidavit was not filed. Sergeant Glyn on the other side
said, that the Presidents which are shown to prove that a Master of the
Chancery may take an Oath, are, that the party has made an Affidavit, as it
appears by the Record, and this is not so pleaded here, and therefore the
Presidents make for us. An Endictment cannot be at the Common Law for perjury
in an Affidavit, if it be not filed, Filing.
for the filing of it makes it a ground to frame the Endictment upon, and so is
it in other Courts, for the filing of it gives power to the Court to make
rules, and orders upon it. Wild on the same side said, that it appears not here
positively, that the Affidavit was made in this cause alleged, but only by way
of argument, which is not good. Roll chief Justice, If it be in the same
business, it shall be intended to be between the same parties: Perjury.
Perjury at the Common Law is intended to be in some Court, and legal
proceedings, for a false oath made before us not touching the matter in
question between the parties, an endictment of perjury lies not, Endictment.
and it appears not here, that the Chancery took notice of this Affidavit, for
nothing was done upon it, and the words as it appears by the Record are
material words, and do make up the business, but they are here omitted. If one
make a false oath, the party is punishable for it by an action upon the case,
in case it be not perjury, for which he may be endicted for it. Case. False
Oath.
A false oath is one thing, and perjury is another thing, for one is judicial,
and the other is extrajudicial. And the Law inflicts greater punishment, for a
false oath made in a Court of justice, than if it be made elsewhere, because
of the preservation of justice. Ierman Justice said, that perjury takes its
name from perverting of justice, and therefore it is intended to be in a Court
of justice. The Court held the endictment ill, and gave Judgment against the
Custodes. Postea.

Upon a retorn of the Coroner of an enquest found before him that one had

The question was whether the party might plead the general pardon. Thereupon
Roll chief Justice said, if one kill another by doing an act which was needless
for him to do, it is man slaughter, and so was it adjudged in Sir John
Chichesters case lately, who killed his man by misadventure in fenceing with
him; but if he kill another in doing an act which belongs to his calling, Pard

it is not man slaughter, therefore men must be wary not to do things, which

Williamson against Norwitch.
Trin. 1652. Banc. sup.
Hill. 1651. rot. 1668.
IS was indebted to Williamson the Plaintiff by a contract, and to Norwitch the
Defendant upon an obligation, and dies intestate, Demurrer to a plea in debt
against an Executor descu cort demesne.
Norwitch intermedles with the goods, Williamson brings an Action of debt
against him as Executor of his own wrong, Norwitch takes letters of
administration of the Goods, and Chatels of I. S. and then pleads that I. S.
was indebted unto him by Obligation, in the sum of 50 l. and that he had taken
out letters of administration of the Goods and Chatels of I. S. and by virtue
thereof does retain Goods and Chatels of I. S. to the value of the said debt,
and besides those has nulla bona, etc. To this plea the Plaintiff demurred,
and the question here was whether the Executor of his own wrong, afterward
taking out letters of administration pendente lite, may retain the goods of the
intestate, to satisfy his own debt due upon Bond, or ought to satisfy the
Plaintiffs debt due by contract. It was urged that he could not plead this
plea, and these books were cited, 5. rep. Cowlters case, and 21 H. 6. f. 8. and
38 Ed. 3. f. 17. and it was said that this case is stronger, because the
administration was taken pendente lite, 5. rep. Midletons case, 2 E. 4.7. Latch
on the other side held the plea good, and agreed Cowlters case 5. rep. and that
the taking of letters of administration shall not destroy the Plaintiffs writ;
but here is a legal administrator, and he might have retained the goods if he
had been Debtor but in equal degree with the other; but he is a Debtor of a
higher nature than the other, for his debt is by Bond, and the others but by
contract, and the law requires his debt to be first satisfied, 2 H. 4.21.
Coment. 545. If he have more goods than will satisfy himself, he ought to make
election what goods he will have, and alter the property; but where there are
not more goods, it is not necessary to do it. And the law should do wrong, if
he should not be first satisfied, for now he is a lawful administrator, and
also a creditor of a higher nature than the other, and because he cannot bring
an Action against himself for his debt, therefore he may by law retain the
goods in satisfaction. And he may satisfy a debt upon a specialty, before a
debt due upon a contract, although a suit were commenced for the debt due upon
the contract, so here he may retain the goods. Roll chief Justice, Why shall
not here the administration purge the wrong which he did as Executor of his own
wrong? It is true indeed that he shall not abate the writ, by taking letters of
administration; but he may plead this plea in bar of the Action, and here it
does not appear but he is rightly Executor, Ab^tement. Bar.

STrode brought an Action upon the case against Homes, Arrest of judgment in
an Action for words.
for speaking of these words of him in relation of his office, he then being
Churchwarden of St. Clements Parish in Oxford; Thou art a cheating knave, and
have cosened the Parish of 40 l. Upon not guilty pleaded, and a verdict for the
Plaintiff. It was moved in arrest of Judgment, that the words were not
actionable, because here was no special loss alleged by the Plaintiff, nor is
he in any danger of corporal punishment, by speaking of the words, Pasc. 10.
Iac. Hopper and Baker. Roll chief Justice answered, the matter is not so much
the loss of his office, as the loss of his credit in being accounted a
cheater. At another day Crook Senior moved for Judgment for the Plaintiff, and
said the words are actionable, for a Churchwarden is not merely a spiritual
officer, but an officer by the Common Law, and also by the Statute, Yarly and
Ellis case, Sir Miles Fleetwoods case, Hob. rep. Bray and Haynes. Crook Junior
on the other side urged that this is not an office of profit, but of trouble
and burden, and no special loss is alleged. Roll chief Justice. Officers which
have no benefit by their offices have more need to be repaired, if they be
scandalized in their Execution of them, and here the scandal is great loss, to
an honest man, and what other remedy can he have to repair himself, Case
but by his Action on the case? Ierman Nicholas and Ask of the same opinion.
And so Judgment was given for the Plaintiff, nisi.

But Roll chief Justice answered, if he be unruly, the Jailer must put on irons

for he lies there under many actions, and we must not remove him to another

Friend against Baker.
Trin. 1652. Banc. sup.
VVIld moved to amend a Record wherein a Judgment was given in the Common
Pleas, For amendment of a record denied.
after the Record was removed by a writ of Error into the Chequer Chamber, the
fault to be amended was, that there is day given over to the parties from
Easter Term to Michaelmas Term, and so Trinity Term is left out, which he
conceived was but a misprision of the Clark, and but a miscontinuance in giving
a wrong day to the parties, 2 H. 7.11. 22 E. 4.3. But Roll chief Justice
answered, Discontinuance.
that this is the act of the Court, and by your reason you may skip over 3 or 4
Terms one after another, without any continuance. The giving of a day more than
is necessary, is no discontinuance, but here wants a day, which makes it not a
miscontinuance, but a discontinuance, and so was it adjudged, 1 Car. at Reading
Term. Nicholas Justice cited 21 H. 6. f. 16. to be adjudged that it is a
discontinuance. Roll chief Justice, A miscontinuance is where one process is
used for another, and so the process is mistaken; but this is a
discontinuance, and cannot be amended. Amendment.
For this is not upon a writ of Error out of the Common pleas as we supposed it
to be, and that the Record had been amended there, for then we would have
advised whether we would amend it here; Miscontinuance.
but it is upon a writ of Error brought in the Chequer Chamber upon a Judgment
given here.

Brock against Vernon.
Trin. 1652. Banc sup.
BRock brought an action of Debt against Vernon as an Executor upon a bond
entered into by Vernon unto the Testator of the Plaintiff, Arrest of judgment
in debt upon a Bond.
the Defendant acknowledges the bond, but says that he gave another bond in
satisfaction of that Bond unto the Testator, which the Testator did accept of
in satisfaction. Plea. Thing in Action.
The Court held this plea ill, and that the party might have demurred upon it,
and needed not to have joined issue, and put it to the Jury, for it is no good
plea to say, that one did accept of one thing in Action, in satisfaction of
another thing in Action, and here the Defendant has confessed the debt, and
therefore his plea being ill, Judgment ought to be against him, and Judgment
at another day was given accordingly.

A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a given Judgment in the Common Pleas
upon an information, Error to reverse a judgment in the Common Pleas upon an
information for selling of Wine without license.
for selling of Wine without license, contrary to the Statute. The Error
assigned was, that the information was brought in the Court of the Common
Pleas, which is in the County of Midlesex, whereas the offense is alleged to be
done at Lambeth in the County of Surry, which ought not to be, as Davisons case
is in Hob. rep. Roll chief Justice, How do you prove this to be within the
Statute of 7 Ed. 6. If the Statute give liberty to Justices of peace, and Oyer
and Terminer, or Justices of assise to enquire of this offense, then an
information cannot be preferred in a County where the offense was not done, and
the meaning of the Statute, 21 Iac. is not to put the party without remedy, and
if he cannot sue by the Statute of 7 Ed. 6. in the County where the offense was
committed, then this Statute of 21 Iac. bars him not to prefer an information
in another County. Latch of Council against the enformer said, that by the
Statute of 7 Ed. 6. an information lies before Justices of Peace, or Assise, or
Gaol delivery. Roll chief Justice, I deny that by the Statute of 7 Ed. 6. the
information could not have been brought in any other place, but in the Courts
at Westminster, and therefore that it is not necessary to bring it in the
County where the fact is done, notwithstanding the Statute of 21 Iac. ^ it is
reason it should be so, because that no jurisdiction is given by the Stat. of
21. Iac to Justices where they had no power before. And the Court of Record
expressed in the Stat. of 7 Ed. 6. shall be intended one of the Courts at
Westminster, and not a Court of Record elsewhere. Therefore show cause why the
Judgment shall not be affirmed.

Sherif, if one be a kin to the party, and Latch offered this Exception, that
the Declaration sounds in Trespass, which Action does not here lie for the
party. Election. Trespass. Case.
But to that Roll chief Justice answered, that it is in the election of the
party to have an action upon the Case, or an Action of Trespass; for an Action
of the Case or an Action of Trespass lies at the election of the party against
one for taking away his Wife. And he demanded whether the two Sherifs of
Bristow where the Rescous was brought were not one Sherif, and whether the
venire was not helped by the Statute And it does also appear that the party was
in custody by virtue of the Process, and it is now after a Verdict: And he
said, that if one rescue the party who is arrested at my suit, because that
after the party is arrested I have an interest in the body of the party,
Rescous.
this Rescous is a Trespass to me, for which I may well maintain an Action of
Trespass. And Ierman Justice said, Pledge.

THe Plaintiff brought an Action upon the Case for selling unto him false Bills

a Declaration in Action upon the case.
with an intent to deceive him: The Defendant demurs upon the Declaration, And
Babington of the Inner Temple offered these Exceptions to it. 1. That the
Ordinance of Parliament for the bringing in of money and plate into Guild hall,
and giving the Commissioners authority to give these bills to them that brought
it in for re-payment thereof with interest at 8 l. per centum, per ^^num, was
mis-recited; for it is said that the Ordinance was made by both Houses of
Parliament, whereas it should be by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, for
the Houses are the places where they sit, and can make no Ordinances, and he
cited Mich. 13 Car. Tydalls case. 2. The Aldermen that are the Commissioners
are not called by their Christian names, as they ought to be, but only by their
Sirnames. 3ly. It is not showed in what manner the Bills were assigned to him,
but he says only that they were assigned in due form of Law, which is too
generally expressed, and to this he cited Mich. 10 Iac. Banc. Reg. Glass and
Gowes case. To these exceptions Latch answered, That the mentioning of the
Ordinance of Parl. and of the Aldermen, is but by way of inducement to the
Action, and nothing to the ground of it, and therefore there need not be so
punctual a recital as is surmised, neither is it necessary to show how the
Bills were assigned, and they are the Defendants own words, nor is it material
how the money was to be paid. R^^ chief Justice, The ground of the Action is
the deceit in assigning over false Bills, and affirming them to be true,
Indictment. Confession.
and the other matters are merely matters of inducement, and used only by way
of recital, and not material to the Action. And you have confessed the deceit
for which the Action is brought by your general demurrer upon the Declaration.

A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a judgment given in an Inferior
Court, A Writ of Error to reverse a judgment given in an inf riour Court.
and the Writ of Error was to remove a Record, quod coram vobis residet de
placito in Curia manerii de Cuttingbye, whereas the Record was, de placito in
Curia Custodum libertatis Anglae authoritate Parliamenti de Cuttingbye. And
therefore against the writ of Error it was objected, that there was a variance
between the writ of Error and the Record, and therefore that the writ of Error
was not good; But against this was cited Lodge and Goodales Case in this Court
23 Car. that it is not necessary to recite in a writ of Error all the words
(...) the description of a Court, and here the writ is not to remove a Record
out of an inferior Court, but the writ of Error is to reverse a judgment in a
Record, quod coram vobis residet. Hales answered, That here is a right
description of the Court, in regard of the place where it was held, and of the
Judge of it, but not in regard of the Lord of it, and therefore he conceived it
a material objection, because a part of the style of the Court is mistaken, and
not only an additional description of it. Roll chief Justice answered, Variance.
If it be but an additional addition or description, it is well enough as it
is; but we will see what has been done in like Cases heretofore; but me thinks
that it shall be intended here to be Curia Custod. libertatis Angl. etc. for
here it is in a Writ of Error which will not lie if it be not a Court of
Record. But Nicholas and Ask Justices said, It cannot be intended a Court of
Record, but a Court Baron, and so the style implies common by intendment. The
Court advised till the next Term. This Case was afterward moved by Latch, who
said, That here is no variance between the Writ and the Record, although the
Writ be not so full as it might have been to describe the Record, and it is
agreeable to the ancient and usual practice at this day, and cited the old book
of Entryes 171, and said, that in Paytons case the Record was in Curia Domini
Regis Civitatis, and the writ of Error was in Curia Civitatis Glocestriae,
Mich. 23 Car. Banc. Reg. rot. 569. and all Courts of Record are originally the
Kings. Hales on the other side said, that the writ of Error ought to show whose
the Court is, and the rather, because it is said to be Curia Manerii. Wadham
Windham, The Register is both ways, and by direction of Parliament the Common
Pleas is styled Curia de Communi Banco. But here the Record appears to be
Custodum, etc. Civitatis, and the Writ does not mention that. The Court would
advise o^ the Presidents. This case was again moved, and Lodge and Woodhalls
case, 22 Car. urged, that the Return of the Certiorari upon the writ of Error
was not good for the variance formerly alleged, but Wadham Windham held it good
enough, and relied upon Presidents showed to Hern the Secondary, as the Court
had directed. Hales on the other side urged that the variance made it not good,
for it cannot be intended the same Court. Roll chief Justice, here is no di^^
opposition between them, for they may both stand together, and the writ of
Error intends it to be a Court of Record, and yet it is the Court of the Manor
also, and therefore it is good in substance, De facto it is the Court of the
Lord of the Manor, but virtually and in dignity it is the Court of the King;
but the Venire is clearly vicious, and therefore let the Judgment be reversed
for that cause.

Jervis and Lucas
Mich. 1652. Bane. sup.
THe Court was moved for one Iervis, Motion for the Court to view a wound to

that the Court might view his wound, and increase the damages given him by the
Jury, because they had given him but twelve pence damages for his wounding,
whereas the parties Arm was broken, and he was in great danger still to lose
the use of it. But Roll chief Justice answered, it appears not by his
Declaration what manner of wounding it was he received, as it ought to have
been, and how can we know how he was wounded? But we will advise, and hear
Council on both sides. At another day Sergeant Parker moved the same matter
again, and cited 3 H. 4. f. 4. and 18 H. 4. f. 23. and Dyer, to prove the Court
might increase the damages. Twisden answered, That the wounding ought to have
been particularly expressed in the Declaration, that the Court might judge of
it by the Record, and the party is not to be viewed by the Court upon the bare
averment of the party made at the Bar. View.
To which Roll chief Justice agreed, and said, how can it appear to us that he
was wounded so as you aver by this Battery? for it may be he was wounded since
your action, neither can you now discontinue the Action, because it is after a

Special Verdict in an Action of Trespa^^ quare clausum ir^g^t.
out of the house of Dawkes, and found guilty, and was burnt in the hand,
afterward Dawkes brings an Action of Trespass quare clausum fregit, and for
carrying away the 250 l. against Coveneigh, who pleads not guilty, and
thereupon a special verdict was found to this effect, that the Defendant did
feloniously break the house, and carry away the 250 l. and was endicted for it,
and was found guilty, and burnt in the hand for it, and if upon the whole
matter, etc. The question upon the special verdict was, If after the Defendant
was endicted and found guilty, and burnt in the hand for this fact at the suit
of the keepers of the libertyes of England, etc. an Action of Trespass quare
clausum fregit, and for carrying away the money, be maintainable by the party,
who was thus robbed against the party that robbed him or no. Latch of Council
with the Plaintiff held, that the Action did well lie, and that the Plaintiff
ought to have Judgment, and that this special matter found by the Jury, is no
bar to the Action, for if he had been attainted for another Felony, it would
not have barred the Plaintiff from his Action, after he had been discharged;
but otherwise it is if the party bring his Action, whilst the party stands
attainted, or the party be attainted pending the Action of Trespass, 33 Eliz.
Wade and Prescots case in this Court, and 34 Eliz. Trussels case in this Court,
and 6 Ed. 4. 4. and in our case the Action was not brought till after the party
tried; But it is objected, that the Trespass here is brought for the same fact
for which the party was tried, and therefore it is unreasonable that he should
be doubly punished for it. To this I answer, that it was at the parties
election at the beginning either to endict him, or to bring his Action of
Trespass, Hudsons case, 4. rep. 43. And here the party has made no election,
for the party was endicted at the suit of the Common Wealth, and not at the
prosecution of the party, and so he has made no election until now. And if
the Action might not be brought, it might prove very mischievous, for the party
might get himself indicted, and so cosen him that is robbed of this money, Dyer
50.^. rep. 13. And the highness of the nature of the endictment does not drown
the Action of Trespass, although that treason does drown Felony, R. 3. 6 H 7.
5. And although the moneys here stolen be for feited to the State, by the
conviction of the Felony, yet an Action of Trespass lies against the Felon to
cause him to render damages pro tanto, although he cannot recover the money in
specie. And the special verdict does not find, that any evidence was given for
the Plaintiff upon the endictment, but only for the State. And for authority he
cited Markham and Cobs case, Trin. 2 Car. Entered 1 Car. rot. 112. Roll chief
Justice said, That Justice Doderidg, and Justice Whitlock held, that the
Trespass lies; Trespass.
But Justice Jones held the contrary, because if the party robbed might have
his election, either to endict the Felon, or to bring his Action of Trespass,
many Felonies would be smothered, and this would prove very dangerous, and
though the party robbed had endicted the Felon he might have had his goods, or
he might have brought an appeal against him, and so there is no inconvenience
to him, 4 Iac. In Higgins case it was adjudged where an Action of Trespass was
brought by the Husband for beating his wife, by reason whereof she dyed, that
the Action did not lie, because it was Felony. Ierman Justice differed from
Roll chief Justice, and said, that the inconvenience on the other side would be
greater than is alleged, if the Felon shall so take advantage of his one wrong,
and in 2 Car. it was held that the Action does lie. Roll chief Justice said, if
the Felon have not wasted the goods, when he is hanged the party shall have
restitution, but if he have wasted them, Restitution,
and has other goods he shall have restitution in value. But let Wild argue it
again the next Term. Accordingly it was again spoken too by Wild, who argued
that the Action of Trespass did not lie, first because the party did not make
fresh suit after the Felon, according to the Statute, 21 H. 8. which was made
to encourage the prosecutor; but the party has not prosecuted here, and it is
all one to recover damages for the goods, and to recover the goods themselves,
so that I conceive that is no difference. And the great inconvenience which
might come to the Commonwealth if the Action should lie, does countervail the
damage that may accrue to the party, if the Action lie not, And it matters not
that it is said the Trespass is a distinct offense from the Felony, for it is
drowned in the Felony, and therefore the party can have no satisfaction for it,
Mich. 21 Iac. Ayers and Higgins case, C. ^. 31 H 6. B^. 15. trespass 415. 4.
Iac. Higgins and Butchers case, B. R. Roll chief Justice, This is after a
conviction, and so here is no fear that the Felon shall not be tried; Bat if it
were before conviction the Action would not lie, for the danger the Felon might
not be tried. And there is no inconvenience if the Action do lie, and since he
could not have had his remedy before, he shall not now lose it, and now there
is no danger of compounding; for the wrong; the rest of the Judges agreed with
Roll, and so Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

Fowke and Boil.
Mich. 1652. Banc. sup.
FO^ke brought an Action upon the case against Boil, Demurrer to a Declaration
in an Action on the case.
for selling of false bills of public faith unto him, to the value of 800 l.
the Defendant demurred to the Declaration, and took these exceptions to it. 1.
That the ordinance of Parliament, upon which these bills of public faith were
grounded was misrecited, for it is said, to be made by both houses, whereas it
ought to be by the Lords and Commons. 2ly. The Aldermen who were authorized by
the ordinance to give these bills of public faith, are not named by their
Christian names, but only Alderman such a one, naming the surname. 3ly. There
is 70 l. expressed to be paid, as is mentioned in the papers, and it is not
expressed at what time or place, as it ought to have been, 16 E. 4. f. 3. and
28 H. 6. f. 3. 4ly. Here is an assignment set forth to be made in due form of
Law; but does not show in what manner, 10. Iac. Mich. Glass and Gowr in this
Court. Latch on the other side said, that the mentioning of the ordinance, and
of the Aldermen was but inducement to the Action, and there is no necessity to
call the Aldermen by their Christian names, but as they are called in the
Ordinance; nor is it necessary to show how the assignment was made, and these
words are the words of the party; nor is it needful to show how the moneys
were to be paid. Roll chief Justice, The cause of the Action is the desceit in
assigning the false bills and affirming them to be true, Inducement.
and all the other matters are but matters of inducement, and by way of
recital, and not material, and you have confessed the deceit by your demurrer,
and therefore let the Plaintiff have his Judgment, nisi. Upon which rule
Ba^ington at another day moved the matter again, and urged that here was an
assignment of papers mentioned, which could not be, for that it is a thing in
Action, which is not assignable, nor can the Ordinance of Parliament give
authority to assign a thing in Action. Roll chief justice, Assignment.
The ordinance of Parliament does give authority to assign the papers. Latch
the paper may be assigned. Green, The Action is brought for the deceit grounded
upon the ordinance, and it is not necessary for the Ordinance to name the
Aldermens Christian names, and these may be true bills though not subscribed,
which is the deceit here alleged. Twisden on the other side said, that the
acqu^ittance is in nature of a bill, according to the intent of the Ordinance,
for it is not only an acquittance of discharge, but to recover moneys upon
them, and so the Defendant calls them, and by the assignment the paper is
assigned, and the Action is grounded on the deceit, and not upon the Statute.
Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

Burcher and Orchard.
Mich. 1652. Banc. sup.
BUrcher brought an Action upon the Case for words, Arrest of judgment in an
Action on the case for words.
against Orchard and his wife, the Jury find that the Baron was guilty, but
that the Feme was not guilty, Wadham Windham moved in arrest of Judgment,
because that the Action is joint, and one of them is found not guilty, and
said, it might have been otherwise if the Feme had been found gvilty, and the
Baron not guilty, and cited 9 Ed. 4. f. 51. Yard on the other side said, that
the verdict has made this exception good, and if the Defendant would have
taken any advantage of it, he should have demurred to the Declaration. Roll
chief Justice denied the difference taken by Windham, and said, if any of the
Defendants spoke the words and be found guilty, the Action will well lie, and
it is all one here, as if the Defendants were two strangers, the Action being
joint; but the doubt is, whether it being after a verdict, this matter may be
offered in arrest of Judgment. At another day Hales moved for Judgment and
said, it was all one if any of the Defendants be found guilty, as if both of
them were found so, and although it do appear by the Declaration, that the
Action could not be brought jointly against them both, because the wrongs are
several, and now one is found guilty, and the other is acquitted, 8 Ed. 4. f.
21. 11 H. 4. f. 5. 9 E. 4. f. 1.
and damages are assessed against one only. And now the verdict has madei the
Declaration good, otherwise it had been if both had been found guilty and
entire damages given against both jointly, Latch on the other side said, that
the speaking of the words cannot be a joint Act, and therefore ought not to be
so laid in one Declaration, for they are several Acts, and several offenses,
as the words do proceed from them severally, and this case is not like the case
of a decies tantum, nor the case of a joint endictment against two, for a joint
endictment shall be accounted as several endictments, and here if the Feme had
been found culpable, perchance it might have been good, because though the wise
only speak actionable words, yet the Action ought to be brought against the
Husband and the Wife. Roll chief Justice, The Declaration is not well laid, for
this cannot be a joint speaking of the words by the Husband and Wife, and
therefore they ought not to be joined in the Action, therefore there ought to
be several judgments and damages if you recover, viz. One against the Husband,
another against the wife, but here is a verdict found which helps it, and this
case is all one with the Case of 9 Ed. 4. for there the Declaration was not
good as it is not here, and here is not a verdict against both, but only a
discharge, and he cited Rethorick and Chapels case, where an Ejectment terrae
and haered is did not lie, yet there by releasing of damages to the heir
judgment was given for the land, and here might have been a release of damages
as to the wife if both had been found guilty, but here in effect is a judgment
but against one of the Defendants. Ierman, Nicholas, and Ask Justices to the
same effect, and so judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

Luddington and White.
Mich. 1652. Banc. sup.
Mich. 1651. rot. 458.
LUddington brought an Action of debt upon a bill against White, Demur^er to a
plea in debt up on a Bill.
the Defendant pleaded, that after the money became due, he and the Plaintiff
did by parol submit to an award, and that there was an award made, that the
Defendant should pay 8 l. to the Plaintiff at such a house, and thereupon the
Plaintiff should give him a general release, and accordly he tendered the money;
to this plea the Plaintiff demurred, and for cause showed that here is a
submission by paroll pleaded after the day of payment expressed in the Bill,
which is not good being by paroll, to discharge a debt due by specialty.
Discharge.
But Wild answered, here were other things submitted besides this, and that may
make the submission good. Roll chief Justice, I see not what authority you have
for this, Reference.
nor how it can be, and 4 H. 6. if one be awarded before auditors to account,
this cannot be referred, and here would be an inconvenience to take away a duty
created by bond by paroll, therefore let the Plaintiff have his Judgment.

Neve and Cross.
Mich. 1652. Banc. sup.
NEve brought an Action upon the case against Cross for charging him with
felony, Arrest of Judgment in an ^ction upon the C^se^ in nature of a
Conspiracy.
and causing a Constable to carry him before a Justice of Peace, and accusing
him to the Justice in these words, viz. He did come to my door, and set a
Pistol to my Breast, and demanded money of me, and I for safeguard of my life did
give him what money he desired. Upon not guilty pleaded, and a Verdict for the
Plaintiff, it was moved by Fletcher of Lincolns Inn, that the words were not
actionable, and therefore that the Plaintiff ought not to have judgment, and
that for these reasons, 1. Because there is but a matter of Trespass alleged in
the words. 2ly. They are but argumentative, and do not charge the Plaintiff
directly with felony, and it may be the money demanded was due to the
Defendant, and the Jury have found all that which sounds to charge the party
with felony against the Plaintiff. Twisden on the other side said, that the
words ought to be taken together, and so they are actionable, and ought not to
be severed; And the ground of the Action is for charging him with felony, and
bringing him before the Justice, and speaking the words there. Roll chief
Justice, If the words found to charge him with felony, the Action will lie, and
we cannot conceive otherwise but that he would have robbed the party, and we
ought not to divide the words, for this were to argue a male divisis, Case.
And you might have pleaded specially, or have given the special matter in
evidence. Ierman Justice differed, but Nicholas and Ask Justices agreed with
Roll, and so judgment was given for the Plaintiff, nill, etc.

Smith and Ward.
Mich. 1652. Banc. sup.
IN an Action of debt upon an Obligation to stand to an award, Arrest of
Judgment in an Action of Debt upon an Obligation to stand to an Award.
and a verdict for the Plaintiff, it was moved in Arrest of Judgment that the
Award was not good, 1. Because here is money awarded to be paid to Baron and
Feme, whereas the Feme is no party to the submission. 2ly. Here is 50 l.
awarded to be paid, but it is not expressed for what, or that it is to be paid
in satisfaction of any thing. 3ly. The submission is of all matters in
difference till April 1652. and the Award is of all matters till December
following. Latch answered, as to the 1 Exception, That the Baron did submit to
the Award, as well for his wife as for himself, and the Award is to make an end
of matters which do concern the Baron and Feme. 2ly. It is not requisite to
show why the 50 l. is to be paid, yet it is showed here, viz. for the ending of
all differences. 3ly. It does not appear by the Record that any matter is
awarded but what is submitted. Roll chief Justice, The Husband may submit for
his Wife, Submission.
and here is an Award on both sides, and if the Award be good in part it is
well enough, nor is it necessary to show why the money, is to be paid, Award.
for all differences are to be concluded upon payment of the money, and the
release is to be made after this, therefore let the Plaintiff have his
judgment, nisi.

THe Court was moved for a Certiorari to remove diverse informations preferred
by an Informer at the Sessions held at the Guildhall in London upon the Statute
of primo Iac. concerning Leather. Motion for a Certiorari.
Roll chief Justice, The Informations were exhibited before the Justices of
Peace, but it is a question whether the Defendant cannot remove them. I believe
there are presidents to prove he may, otherwise the Defendant might be
prejudiced; but enform us what the course is in the Common Pleas in such cases,
In the mean time we will advise.

Wall and his wife against Bye.

Pasch. 1652. rot. 70.
IVdgement was given for the Plaintifs in an Action upon the Case brought in
Bristow for these words spoken of the Wife: Judgment in an Action upon the
Case for words reversed. Error.
She is Lews Reads Whore, and he knows her as well as her Husband. This
Judgment was reversed upon a writ of Error brought in this Court, because it
did appear by the Record that the words were spoken before the late Act made
against adultery and incontinency, before which time such words had not been
actionable.

Iennings and Downs.

Trin. 1652. rot. 546.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a judgment sur non sum informatus
given in the Common Pleas in an Ejection firmae. Error to reverse a judgment
upon a non sum informatus in an Eject one fi^mae. Certiorari.
The Error assigned was, that it appeared by the Record that the Declaration
was before the Plaintiff had any cause of Action. Wild answered, It does not
appear so, but if it do, then we say that there is a wrong original certified,
and we pray that we may have a new Certiorari to have the true original
certified. Roll chief Justice, Take it, for it is in affirmance of a Judgment,
which ought to be favored.

Webb and VVashborn.
Mich. 1652. Banc sup.
Webb brought an Action of Trespass for entering into his house and taking away
diverse goods against Washborn, Arrest of Judgment in Trespass.
and obtains a Verdict against him. It was moved in Arrest of judgment, and
these Exceptions taken to the Declaration, First, That the Plaintiff had
declared for the taking away of a Trunk with writings, and does not show what
the writings were. To this Wadham Windham answered, that the Declatation was
good notwithstanding, and cited a Case adjudged, where an Action was brought
for taking away of two Trunks with Clothes, and it was not said what Clothes,
and yet held good: And a Case in 43 Ed. 3. 24. Another Exception was taken,
That the Plaintiff declared for the taking away of a great Beam, Scales and
weights generally, and shows not what weights. To this Windham answered, that
was well enough, because the Beam and the Scales and Weights do all go to the
making up of one and the same thing, and have all a relation one to the other,
as an Action of Trespass brought for the taking away de Caruca cum apparatu is
well brought, as appears in the old Book of Entries. Latch on the other side
said, that the Declaration is uncertain, and that it is not like the case of
the Trespass de Caruca cum apparatu, for the Weights are nothing tending to
make the Beam perfect, and it is as uncertain as to bring an Action for the
taking away of five locks and keys, which has been held to be naught. Hales on
the other side said, that there is certainty enough, because it is all one to
say a Beam with Scales and Weights, which makes all but one thing, as to say a
Beam, Scales and Weights, or as to say a Ship with Anchors and Cables. Roll
chief Justice, How can we reduce the Weights to any certainty as the
Declaration is laid? Incertainty.
and if the Declaration had not been with the word and, it would not have
helped it, for it may be there were a hundred weights, or a thousand weights,
And therefore let the Judgment be arrested n^si. Another Action of Trespass
was brought by the same party, Declaration.
wherein he declared for the taking away of two great Trunks locked, full of
Linen, Woollen, Pewter, and amongst other things, for 4 pair of hangings,
against which also, exception was taken in Arrest of Judgment for the
incertainty. Roll chief Justice, I conceive that four pair of hangings is
certain enough, but here is no vi et armis mentioned, in the Declaration, which
ought to be in an Action of Trespass for entering into his house, and taking his
goods, as the case here is, and therefore for this cause let the Plaintiff show
cause why a nil capiat per billam shall not be entered against him. Postea.

It was said by Roll chief Justice, That if one find my goods, Action on the
Case for goods found.
and refuse to deliver them to me, an Action upon the case lies against him,
although he convert them not to his own use.

Bond and Martin.
Mich. 1652. Banc. sup.
BOnd brought an Action of Debt upon a Bond given unto him as Sherif to save
him harmless, The Defendant pleaded a special plea, Special plea to an Action
of debt upon a Sherifs Bond.
which amounted unto no more than that he had saved him harmless; to this Plea
exception was taken, because he did not show how he had saved him harmless. To
this Wadham Windham answered, If it be that he has from time to time saved him
harmless, it is well enough. Roll chief Justice, It is not so here, and
therefore let the Plaintiff have judgment, nisi.

Mich. 1652. Banc. sup.
IT was said by Roll chief Justice, Where an express averment ought to be.
Averment.
that in an Action of Trespass quare vi et armis, etc. There ought to be an
express averment in the Declaration of the force, and it ought not to be
expressed with a whereas there was such a force.

Baynton and Cheek.
Mich 1652. Banc. sup.
Trin. 1651. rot. 574.
BAynton brought an Action of Account against Cheek, as his receiver. Plea to
an Action of Account.
The Case in sum was this, Baynton deposited two hundred pounds laid upon a
horse-race in the hands of Cheek, to be delivered to the party that should win,
according to Articles made betwixt the parties. Baynton supposing he had won
the money, demands it of Cheek, who had delivered over the money to another
whom he supposed had won the wager, and the money being not delivered to
Baynton, Baynton brings this Action against Cheek; Cheek the Defendant, as to
one hundred pounds pleads, Ne unques receptor, Plea.
upon which plea he was adjudged to account before Auditors, and before the
Auditors he pleads in discharge of the account, that he had delivered over the
money to another that won the wager. The Plaintiff replied, That there was foul
play used by the other party, in striking one of the horses that ran the race
upon the Nose, which was foul play, and against the Articles made betwixt them,
and so he ought not to have delivered the money. The question was whether this
was a good plea in discharge of the Account before the Auditors. Roll chief
Justice said, The plea was not good, in regard that the Defendant was adjudged
to account, which does imply that the money was fairly won by the Plaintiff.
Latch on the other side urged, that the replication was not good, but is
impertinent, and therefore that the Plaintiff can have no Judgment, though the
plea in Bar be not good, but that there ought to be a Repleader. At another day
Green moved for judgment for the Plaintiff, and cited Hob. 112. Ta^kers case,
That an issue joined upon impertinent matter is not helped by the Statute, and
Kent and Halls case in Hob. Rep. but here is only an informal issue, which is
helped by the Verdict, as are Rawden and Tuts case, and Napper; and Dawkes case
in Hob. Reports, and Mich. 2 Car. Giggon and Purchases case, and said, that at
the Common Law a Trial upon a double issue was good, Broke Issue 30. 2ly. This
plea of the Defendant ought to have been pleaded in bar of the Action, and not
in discharge before the Auditors, 1 Ed. 5. 2. Brook Account 83. and Dyer 196.
Hungerford: case. Latch on the other side said, that the Replication is
imperfect, and that the Verdict helps it not, the Defendant alleges the
Articles made upon the wager, and the replication is about striking of the
Horse, and answers not the matter pleaded in Bar for the Act, of the Rider,
viz. the striking of the horse is not the Act of Bish who made the Articles,
and besides here is no breach of Articles, for they do not prohibit to strike
the Horse, or to ride foul, according to the Laws of a Horse-race, and the
Rider does not appear to be Bish his Servant, but a third person, and an Action
of the Case lies against him, and not against Bish, who for ought appears has
done nothing against the Articles, and the matter in bar of the Account is well
pleaded, and could not be otherwise, as the Case is, and it is well enough,
though it be not pleaded in bar of the Action, for he could not have pleaded ne
unques receptor pur account render, 9 E. 4.1^. Dyer 19 H. 6. 5. As he could not
have pleaded the general issue, and given the special matter in evidence; And
he cannot plead thus in bar of the Action of Account, and there is not one book
that says otherwise, 41 E. 3. 31. 5 H. 5. 5. 19 H. 6. 5. 22 H. 6. 49. 21 E. 4.
67. 5 H. 5. 1. 5 E. 4. 41. 1 E. 5. 2. 27 H. 7. 35. Which books do show it may
be as well pleaded before the Auditors, as before in bar of the Action, 14 E.
3. Fitz. Account 68. 21 E. 4. 54 By these books he is compelled to plead these
matters before Auditors, and the other books are not expressly against it: And
in this case here is not a bailment purely to deliver over, but there is
subsequent matter which directs how it shall be delivered over, and this matter
he must plead. But admitting the Bar to be ill, if the replication be
impertinent, and that he has confessed that he has no cause of Action, then
it is with us, and here is no pertinent matter pleaded to avoid the matter
confessed, and so the Judgment ought to be against the Plaintiff, 3 Report,
Ridgeways Case is, That if impertinent matter be in a replication, which
answers not the bar, Judgment ought to be given against the Plaintiff, and the
matter confessed is not in bar of the Action of account as is objected. 1 H. 7.
2. 21 H. 6. 26. Hales, The matter of delivery makes not the matter. The
subsequent matter is grounded upon the Condition made upon the delivery, Dyer
169. and here is an insufficient bar, and the matter of the replication is
good, according to the matter alleged in the bar, for the Articles ought to be
interpreted according to the intention of the parties, which was, that the race
should be fairly won, which is not so here, 18 E. 4. 4. matter of Covenant by
deed may be discharged by subsequent matter of fact; and the Riders here shall
not be accounted mere strangers, for they are Instruments made by the parties,
and there is confidence put in them to perform the act of riding, and their
acts shall be the acts of the parties; And here is nothing showed in the
replication which destroys the Action. Roll chief Justice, If you have
confessed the Articles, and alleged impertinent matter in the replication, how
can you take advantage of an i^^ bar, and how can you interpret the intent of
the Articles otherwise than is expressed by them? And how can we take notice
here, that there was not fair play in the running of the race? and I doubt of
the books cited by Latch, Bar. Auditors, Account.
for where matter may be pleaded in Bar, the party shall not be compelled to
come before Auditors, for that were unreasonable. If I deliver goods to deliver
over, and the party do it not, he is accomptable to me, but if he deliver them
over, he is not, for he may plead this in bar of the Action, and so is it in
the Case at the Bar, and you might have given the special matter in evidence
here by the meal Act, Plea.
and this plea here before the Auditors is clearly void. The main doubt here
is, whether there be apparent matter to the Court to hinder the Plaintiff from
his Judgment, I conceive the Articles shall be interpreted fairly, and that
there ought not to be fowl play according to Common intendment, and it is
material to show there was fowl play in the replication, and so the issue is
well joined, and Judgment ought to be for the Plaintiff. Ierman and Nicholas
Justices to the same purpose as Roll.

plea amounts to not guilty.
for the entering into his Land, It was said by Roll chief Justice, That if in
an Action of Trespass vi and armis for entering into land, the Defendant plead
his entry by virtue of a lease for years, this amounts to no more than not
guilty, and the Plaintiff may demur upon the Plea, Demurrer^
and show it for cause of demurrer, that it amounts to no more.

for a certiorari to remove certain endictments preferred against him in
London, for selling of leather, to the end he may have an indifferent trial,
notwithstanding the Statute, which directs that the endictment be preferred in
the County, were the offense was committed. Roll chief Justice, The Statute was
made for the ease of the Defendant, and therefore he may remove the endictment,
otherwise he shall be in worse case than he was before the Statute. Therefore
take a Certiorari.

Yongue and Petit.
Mich. 1652. Banc. sup.
Pasc. 1652. rot. 159.
YOngue brought an Action of debt against Petit upon an Obligation and
declares, Demurrer to a replication in debt upon a Bond.
that whereas at the request of the Defendant he did become bound with a third
person, for the payment of a certain sum of money unto I. S. at a certain day,
the Defendant became bound in an Obligation to the Plaintiff, the condition of
which Obligation was, that if the Defendant did pay the money unto I. S. at the
day limited, for which the Plaintiff was bound, and in the mean time should
save him harmless, that then the Obligation should be void, and for not
performing this condition he brought his Action. The Defendant pleads that he
caused the party, with whom the Plaintiff was bound, to submit himself to
Prison, and that the Plaintiff was not damnyfied. The Plaintiff replies and
denies not the Bar; but says that a latitat was sued out against him, and that
he feared to be arrested, and upon this replication the Defendant demurs, and
these exceptions were taken to it. 1. That he does not say he took out a
latitat prout patet per recordum. 2ly. It was questioned how the words in the
mean time shall be understood. For the first exception Latch held it not
material, Relation.
and for the second he held that they refer to the whole condition. Roll chief
Justice said, it is not necessary here to plead non damnificatus if the party
be in prison, and the words in the mean time refer to the last words only of
the condition; But one has pleaded an ill plea, and the other has alleged an
ill breach, therefore nil capiat per billam, nisi. Yet we will advise.

The Mayor and Commonalty of London against Hatton.
Mich. 1652. Banc. sup.
THe Mayor and Commonalty of London brought an Action of Covenant against
Hatton, Demurrer to a Plea in Covenant.
for not paying a rent reserved by them upon a lease for years made unto him of
the Garblers office. The Defendant pleaded that this office was an office of
trust reposed in the City of London, and could not be let for years, and
consequently there was no ground of Action. To this plea the Plaintiff demurs.
Hales held that this office may be let for years, because the Mayor and
Commonalty of London have a Fee simple in the office by their charter, and that
they have not only a mere trust reposed in them to execute it. And 2ly. If it
could not be granted, yet here is no forfeiture, for this lease shall be
accounted but a deputation, and not a granting over of the office. And 3ly. The
Lessees covenant shall bar him from pleading this plea. Wadham Windham prayed a
day to be heard. Roll chief Justice, It will be hard for you to maintain the
Defendants plea, Deputation. Lease.
For without doubt the Mayor may make a Deputy to execute this office; But here
he has a Fee simple in it, and may thereby make a lease of it, and the Lessees
Covenant will bind him to pay the rent. Iudicium pro querente, nisi. and At
another day Wadham Windham put the Case, and argued that the office of Garbler
is not grantable, because that this office is an office of trust reposed in a
corporation, and it is so reposed for the public good, and the office it self
is not vested in the Mayor, and therefore he cannot grant it, although he may
make a Deputy to execute it, for there the Acts of the Deputy do light upon
the Master to be answerable for, 29 H. 6 44. Dyer 238. a Mayor of a Town may
make a Deputy; but he cannot grant this office or make a revenue of it. Roll
chief Justice, It is considerable in regard it is an office of trust, whether
it may be leased out, although he may make a Deputy. Therefore argue it again
the next Term.

and for taking his Cattle; the Defendant as to the force and arms pleads non
cul. and as to the rest he justifies that the Cattle went in through the defect
of the Plaintiffs enclosures; the Plaintiff replies that the Cattle came in
through another man's fence into his ground; to this replication the Defendant
demurs, (...) shows for cause that the Plaintiff does not assign where the place
of the other Close lies, through which the Cattle came through. Yard said it is
not necessary to show where it lies, for they went not in where the Defendant
has alleged, and so the traverse is well taken Wadham Windham on the other
side answered, here is a new assignment, and he answers not the Trespass for
which the Action is brought, and because it is a new assignment, we must give a
new answer; and therefore you must show the place where your new assignment
lies. Roll chief Justice, He pleads no more but that the Cattle came in at
another place, than is pleaded, and he needs not show the place, But here the
Defendants plea is not good, Plea.
for he pleads a prescription where it ought to be a custom, that the occupyers

BY Roll chief Justice, Who may take advantage of a fault in a Plea, Advantage.
If there be a fault in a plea in matter of form, and after there is a fault
also in the replication, and the Defendant demurs to it, but shows no cause of
demurrer, he shall take no advantage of this fault in the replication; but he
who joins in the demurrer shall take advantage of the ill plea, and so was it
adjudged, Pasc. 1. Car. in this Court in Prat and Thimblethorps ^ase, and he
said that all faults in pleading are incurable at the Common Law, and therefore

Heath and Vdall
Mich. 1652. Banc. sup.
HEath a Caryer brought an Action of the Case against Vdall, Arrest of
Judgment in an Action upon the case
and declares among other things for plundering of him of viginti fardellas
Anglice packs, and in arrest of Judgment it was moved that the words vinginti
fardellas Anglice packs is uncertain; But Maynard argued that it might be good,
because the Caryer could not declare otherwise, for he could not know what was
in the packs, and he cited one Bedingfields case, Trin. 10. Car. Declaration.
where an Action was brought for a library of books, and for apparel, and
adjudged good; But Roll chief Justice said, it could not be good for the
apparel. Wadham Windham on the other side held the words uncertain as they are,
and said he ought to have showed that they were packs with goods, or have
shown what was in them, for a pack is but a measure of a thing. Roll chief
Justice answered, if it be but a measure of a thing, then no damages are given
for them, and then the Action is good for the rest; But we will advise.
Afterward in the same Term Maynard moved for the opinion of the Court, and
thereupon the Court held, that the words are uncertain as they are, for he
ought to have expressed what was in the packs, and ruled a nil capiat per
billam to be entered.

Levingston and Crompton.
Mich. 1652. Banc. sup.
LEvingston brought an Action in this Court against Crompton, Exceptions to a
plea of privilege.
The Defendant pleads that he is a Clark of the Chancery, and that all Clarks
of the Chancery ought to be sued in the Chancery only, and not elsewhere, and
demands judgment if he ought to make any other answer in this Court. Two
Exceptions were taken to the plea, 1. He says, That all Clarks of the Chancery
have used to be sued in the Chancery, and not elsewhere, and does not say, nor
any of them have been used to be sued elsewhere, and though all of them have
not been used to be sued elsewhere, yet that hinders not but that some of them
have been sued elsewhere. 2ly. He pleads that he is a Clark of the Chancery,
and ought to be impleaded in the Chancery held at Westminster, before the
Keepers of the liberty of England, etc. time out of mind, which is not true.
Hales answered, That this Court ought to take notice of the privilege of
Chancery, Notice. Privilege.
although it be not well pleaded; But Roll chief Justice denied that they ought
to do it, and said, That it is the Custom for the Clarks of the Exchequer, when
they plead their privilege, to bring the red book wherein their privileges are
written into the Court, and upon sight of their privilege there written, it is
used to be allowed, but it is not so of the privileges of the other Courts, but
they must be pleaded, and so here, And because it is not well pleaded here,
therefore show cause why you should not plead in chief.

Pitton and Rey.
Mich. 1652. Banc. sup.
PItton appeared to an Action brought against him at the suit of Rey, Motion
for the Plaintiff to declare speedily.
but no declaration was put in against him. Upon an Affidavit that the
Defendant was a Merchant, speedily to go to Sea, It was moved for him that the
Plaintiff might forthwith declare against him, that thereby he might direct his
Attorney what to plead, and might have his liberty to be gone. Roll chief
Justice, By the course of the Court he has three terms liberty to declare, but
this is an extraordinary Case, Therefore let him declare Thursday next,
otherwise he shall not declare till he come back. Nota.

Mich. 1652.
BY Roll chief Justice, A private Sessions of the Peace is not said to be held

Staples Case.
Mich. 1652. Banc. sup.
A Rule was read on the Capital side for Staples a Justice of Peace of Sussex,
Cause why no Attachment against a Justice of Peace.
to show cause why an Attachment should not be granted against him for
proceeding upon an Endictment of forcible entry, and fining the party, after a
Certiorari was delivered unto him to remove the Endictment into this Court, and
thereupon it was prayed that it might be granted, and Sir Tho. Styles, and Sir
John Sidleys case 8 Caroli was urged, where an Attachment was granted in the
like case. Wild on the other side prayed it might not be granted, because the
parties endicted did not tender sureties to proceed to a Trial upon the
Endictment, as the Statute directs, and because the fine was set upon the
parties before the Certiorari was delivered, and it is in the election of the
Justice to set a fine upon the party, Fine. Traverse. Plea.
and refuse to admit the party to his traverse, as some do hold. Roll chief
Justice, Upon view of the force the Justice may set a fine upon the party, and
refuse to admit the party to his traverse, or plea, at his pleasure; but the
case is not so here; and in 15 Car, it was resolved, that if a Certiorari be
brought to the Sessions to remove an Endictment of forcible Entry preferred
against diverse persons, if some of them come in and find sureties for the
damages, it is good for them all to remove the Endictment for the rest, else it
would be mischievous for them that find the sureties. And he said, that if any
thing be done at a private Sessions of Peace, it ought to be returned to a
Quarter Sessions, or into this Court, Upon view of the force the Justices of
Peace are Judges, Error.
and may set a fine, and if there be Error a writ of Error may be brought. The
rule was, that Staples be examined upon interrogatories, and make a return of
the Certiorari Monday next, and that he restore the fine to the party.

Wood and Mountney.
Mich. 1652. Banc. sup.
IN the Case of VVood and Mountney, Bail not discharged by the death of the

Roll chief Justice said, That if the Plaintiff in a writ of Error die before
the matter be determined, yet his Bail are not thereby discharged.

Webb and Washborn.
Hill. 1652. Banc. sup.
THe Action was an Action of Trover and Conversion for diverse goods; Arrest of
judgment in a Trover and Conversion.
The Defendant pleaded not guilty, and upon issue joined, a Verdict was found
for the Plaintiff. It was moved in Arrest of Judgment that the Plaintiff amongst
other things had declared for a Trunk with writings, which is uncertain. Wadham
Windham for the Defendant said, the Declaration is certain enough, and cited a
Case where an Action was brought for two Trunks of Clothes, and does not say
what Clothes, and yet adjudged good. Another Exception was taken. That the
Plaintiff declares for a great Beam, Scales, and Weights, which is also
uncertain. To this Windham answered, It was certain enough, because they all
make but one thing, by reason of the relation they have one to the other; And
in the old Book of Entries we find, that an Action of Trespass was brought pro
Caruca cum apparatu, and adjudged good. Latch on the other side, as to the last
Exception said, It is not answered, for the words are very uncertain, and it is
not like the case of the Trespass cited, de Caruca cum apparatu, for the
Weights go not to the perfecting of the Beam, as the apparatus does of the
Plow, and it is as uncertain as to bring an Action for five Locks and Keys,
which is not good. Hales answered, it is certain enough, for it is all one as
if he had said, A Beam, Scales, and Weights, which is as certain as to say, a
Ship with Anchors and Cables. Roll chief Justice, How can we reduce the Weights
to any certainty as the Declaration is laid? and if the word and had been added
it would not have helped, for they may be a hundred Weights, or a thousand.
Another Exception was taken that the Plaintiff in another Action had declared
for four pair of Hangings, which is uncertain: But Roll chief Justice said,
That that might be well enough understood. Green at another day insisted, that
four pair of hangings is very uncertain, but if it had been said four suits it
had been well; Besides, the very word hangings is a doubtful word, for it
shows not whether the hangings were Silk or Stuff, or what else they were made
of, as it ought to be. He also took an Exception that the Plaintiff had only
showed that here was a denial and refusal to restore the goods, but no
conversion of them is showed. To this Hales answered, That the Action being an
Action upon the Case, It is not necessary to show the Conversion, and for the
four pair of hangings it is well enough, for a pair is a couple when the word
is used of dead things, and not like a pair of tongues which make but one thing
nor is it material to express of what the hangings are made, as it is not in
an Action brought for diverse pair of stockings material to say, whether they
were of thread, silk, wosted, or woollen, as has been adjudged, and the word
hangings is certain, for any one will conceive them to be meant of hangings of
a room. Roll chief Justice, The Action is an Action upon the case, and it is
not necessary to show a conversion, for the Action is not brought for the
conversion, and if it were so, if a demand, and a denial be proved, does not
this prove a conversion? Case. Trover and Conveision.
As an Action of the case lies for keeping one out of possession, although the
party does enter afterward, and the four pair of hangings is certain enough,
and it is not like as where Latin words are mingled with English in a
Declaration, and the words being taken in the English construction shall be
understood to be eight hangings. Nor is it material to express of what the
hangings are made; But the great doubt is, whether the words be meant of
hangings for a room or not, and I suppose they cannot be meant of other
hangings, the words being in English, and not in Latin with an Anglice, and I
believe you cannot show me any thing else, that the words can by common
intendment signify. Iudicium nisi. The case was again moved at another day by
Latch, who urged that four pair of hangings are words uncertain; but if it had
been four suits it had been well, so that here is a misaplication of words to
express the thing meant, and he might as properly have said a suit of Shoes,
or a suit of Conies. If one say he has lost a hanging, this is uncertain of it
self, for it is the predicament of situs and not of substance, for a hanging is
a posture, and the word pair makes it more uncertain than it was without it.
Hales answered, that it is certain enough, for the word hanging is used here
substantively, and not as a participle, and the common use of the word is only
applicable to the hangings of a room, and the four pair shall be undestood
eight hangings. Roll chief Justice, A pair is properly when one of the things
so called, cannot be properly used without the other; but yet the words may be
also understood so many couple, and here you cannot intend the words to mean so
many suits of hangings, and you might have expressed your meaning by so many
pieces of hangings, and therefore it seems doubtful. Ierman Justice, Here the
words do not express the number of the things, as they do when you say a pair
of Oxen or the like. Nicholas as Ierman, Ask Justice, A pair is uncertain, for
that word may be meant more than two in number, as when you say a pair of
cards, and a pair of hangings in some places is meant a suit of hangings. Roll
chief Justice, If it be so, then it is more uncertain, the word hangings may be
good enough; but how can the number be known? Curia advisare vult. Afterward
the Court moved the Defendant to suffer the Plaintiff to amend his Declaration,
and to plead anew, and to consent to a new trial.

Askwiths Case.
Hill. 1652. Banc. sup.
THe Court was moved to quash an order of Sessions made at Durham against
Askwith, Motion to quash an order of Sessions.
for not serving the office of a Constable, or finding an other able person to
serve the place for him, being elected according to the custom of the place
where he was elected to serve. The Exception taken was, that it is not showed
that he was elected at a Court Leet, and the Sessions have no power to elect a
Constable. Roll chief Justice, He is a Constable elected by a by-Law, By Law.
and it is not necessary there should be any other election then according to
the custom, and he must serve in his turn, or contribute to the charge for
another to serve for him, Custom.
and this is a good custom and used in many places, and I do find one my self
in my turn in one place, and make no use of my privilege to avoid it. Another
exception was taken, that the complaint made of the party was, that he would
neither serve the office, nor contribute for another to serve it, and the order
is only that he refused to contribute and so is not warranted by the custom, by
which he has an election to serve or contribute. Quashed, nisi, etc.

HOwell Gwin was brought to the Bar being convicted for forgeing of a deed,
Judgment against one convicted of forgery.
and was demanded what he could say why Judgment should not be given against
him. Boynton of Council with the Prisoner moved the Court, that in regard there
was an information of perjury depending here against the witnesses, upon whose
Testimony the Prisoner was convicted of the perjury, and that the Prisoner does
endeavor to proceed with all the speed that is possible against them in this
information, that the Judgment may be stayed in the mean time against him.
Roll chief Justice answered, if they be found guilty of the perjury, they shall
be punished; but we will give Judgment against your Clyent in the mean time,
which was done accordingly in these words following, Judgment for forgery.
viz. you are convicted of forgeing a deed, by putting a dead man's hand unto
it, therefore the Court gives this Judgment against you, that you are fined at
a hundred pound, and shall stand on the pillory two hours before the Hall door,
with a paper on your head showing the nature of your offense. Memorandum the
party cut off a dead man's hand, and put a pen, and a seal in it, and so signed,

Special verdict in an ejectione firmae.
I. S. seized of lands in Fee makes a lease of it to I. D. at Will, A. B. puts
the Tenant at Will out of possession, and after the Tenant at Will enters, and
takes a lease at Will of him that put him out of possession, the question was,
whether he should hold the land by virtue of his first lease, or by virtue of
his second agreement. To this Roll chief Justice said, if one make a lease at
Will to one, and he be ousted, Will. Determination.
and then enter again and take a new estate, the Will is determined; but a
stranger cannot determine his Estate without his consent; but here he has
determined his first Estate by his new contract with the disseisor of his
Lessor. And he said, if Livery and Seisin be made upon one Acre of land in the
name of two Acres, it is good for both the Acres, for it is not necessary that
the party that gives the livery should go to all the land mentioned in the deed

DRake brought an Action against Drake for these words, Arrest of Judgment in
an Action for words.
viz. Thou have preached lies in the Pulpit; the Plaintiff being a master of
Arts, and incumbent of a living. Wadham Windham held the words actionable,
because they were spoken of the Plaintiff in relation to his professision, and
cited one Hinkes case, where these words spoken of the Plaintiff being a Brasier
were held actionable, viz. Thou have cozened me of a Pan. And if one say to
another, Thou have poisoned a man. If the man be dead, the words are
actionable, although he do not say that he did it wilfully. The Court inclined
the words are actionable, because they are scandalous. And the rule was
Iudicium nisi, etc.

whereas in truth those lands are settled upon Sir Thomas Revell by decree in
Chancery, and the Prosecutor has also brought 18 several Actions against the
Tenants of the lands, and has declared against none of them, and there are
four Affidavits against the first Affidavit. Green on the other side said, that
the party is in Court, and says he is still in fear of his life, Peace.

Massey and Aubry.
Hill. 1652. Banc. sup.
AN Action of Debt was brought upon an Obligation to stand to an Award: Arrest
of judgment in debt upon an Obligation to stand to an Award.
The Defendant pleaded that the Arbitrators made no Award; The Paintif replies
that the Vmpire made an award, and sets it forth, and assigns the breach, and
upon issue joined, and a verdict for the Plaintiff, It was moved in Arrest of
Judgment that the assignment of the breach was not good, for the incertainty
of it, for the breach is assigned upon but a part of the Award; for the breach
assigned is, that the Defendant should pay the Arrears of rent due after the
purchase of certain lands; and does not show what these Arrears are. But Roll
chief Justice said, That the words since the purchase thereof seem to make this
certain, yet stay till the other moves. At another day the case was moved
again, and the same exception insisted upon by Barry of the Inner Temple who
formerly moved it. Hales held the Exception not good, and that the breach was
well assigned, because though it seem uncertain of it self, yet it relates to a
thing which makes it certain; As an Award for one to deliver to another all the
goods in such a Shop which belonged to him, has been held to be good. But
Barry answered, That it is utterly uncertain, and that there is nothing in the
Award which can make it certain, and here is a fourfold incertainty in the
Award. 1. It cannot be known what these arrears are that are awarded to be
paid. 2ly. It appears not by the Award for what lands these arrerages of rent
awarded to be paid are due, for there are no lands mentiond, but only two
leases of land. 3ly. It appears not by whom the arrerages are due. 4ly. It
appears not to whom the arrerages are due. Roll chief Justice, All the matter
is, whether it appears that these arrerages of rent awarded to be paid were in
question or no, and it seems they were, because the lease and the rent
thereupon reserved are both in question; but it is not certain what these
arrears of rent are, and so the party that is awarded to pay them, cannot tell
what sum of money he is to pay. Ierman Justice said, he may know, because he was
Tenant of the land. Barry replied he cannot know when the purchase was made,
and the arbitrament is that the party shall pay all the arrears since the
purchase. Curia advisare vult. At another day the case was again moved by
Barry, and exceptions taken that the breach was assigned upon a thing not
submitted unto, or awarded to be performed. And secondly. The award is
uncertain in many things. First, It appears not what rent was due to be paid,
but only by implication, which is not good. Secondly, It appears not for what
the rent is due; nor 3ly. How much rent is due, and Salmons case, in the 5.
rep. was cited. Also it was objected that the award was not final, and
concluding, and therefore not good: Also the Award is unreasonable, and for
that cause also it is not good, and he cited 21 E. 4. f. 40. and 17 E. 4. f.
51. and prayed for the Defendant that judgment might be stayed. Hales on the
other side prayed for judgment, and said, That the Arbitrators were not to
ascertain particularly the rent to be paid, but it is sufficient for them to
make the Award touching all the differences betwixt the parties, and an
averment may ascertain the particular things, being they are only matters of
fact, although one may not be admitted by an averment to supply an Award in a
matter, wherein it was in the substance of it defective before, Roll chief
Justice, What certainty is there by the Award that the party shall enjoy all
his right in the two leases in difference between the parties? for the payment
of the rent, Both parties know what rent is due, reserved by the leases, but
how can the party know what the arrears are which are accrewed since the
purchase? Award.
for how can he know when the purchase was made? for it is made by a stranger,
and what if the stranger will not tell him when he made it? so that me thinks
the Award is unreasonable, and then it cannot be good. The rule was, Nil capiat
per Billam, Nisi, etc.

That if money be paid to a wrong person upon a Bill of Exchange, if the wrong
person do show the Bill, by the Custom of Merchants this is a good payment, and
the party that paid it shall not be charged again. Wild, It is doubtful
whether the Custom be so or not. But Roll chief Justice said, Custom.
here is a verdict for the Custom, and therefore it were well if the parties
would agree to a new trial, but if they will not, take your judgment, because
the verdict has found it a good custom.

Custodes against the Inhabitants of Stoneham in Suffolk.

THe Inhabitants of the Parish of Stoneham in Suffolk were indicted for not

set upon them, because the way is not yet amended, and a Traveller that passed
that way has lost his horse since the Trial, by reason the way was so bad, so
that the Horse brake his Leg. Twisden on the other side moved the fine might be
respited, because there was a contest between this Parish and another which of
them ought of right to repair the way, and in regard this Parish is very poor,
and lastly, because the way cannot be amended until Summer, and then it shall
be done. Roll chief Justice, The fine shall be set upon you for not repairing
it already, because the verdict found you ought to do it, and the Country
suffers by your neglect, Fine. Distringas.
Therefore take a Distringas to levy a fine of twenty pounds of the
Parishioners for not repairing it.

You may do this by the course of the Court without motion, therefore why move

that the fraud is the ground of the Action, and all the other matter set forth

requisite to be so punctual in setting that forth as is surmised, and we are
bound to take notice of the Ordinance, Inducement, Notice.

A Man brought an Action of the case against one for causing him to be endicted

that upon preferring of the Bill to the grand Jury, they found an Ignoramus,
and so there is a repugnancy in the Declaration, which sets forth that the
Plaintiff caused him to be endicted, and yet says that an Ignoramus was found,
so that upon the matter it was found no Endictment. Wild on the other side
said, the Declaration is well enough, and there is no repugnancy, for the words
shall be taken according to the common construction. Hales, There is another
Exception. viz. That all the proceedings mentioned in the Declaration are
expressed to be before the Judges as Commissioners for the Gaol delivery, and
not as Commissioners of Oyer and Terminer. Roll chief Justice, We will intend
that the Endictment was before them as Justices of Oyer and Terminer,
Endictment.
and in truth it is not material before what authority he was endicted; and in
this case the trouble the party is put unto by reason of this endictment, is
the cause of his bringing this Action, and not his Trial upon it, Cure.
and therefore the authority is not material; nor is it material whether the
endictment be good or no, and the words here are to be construed according to
common intendment, viz. That he was endicted though the endictment was not
found, but an Ignoramus, and so by consequence in Law it is no Endictment upon
which he could be tried to come in danger of his life. Hales moved that they
might amend the Declaration, and go to a new Trial. Roll chief Justice, It

The Exception taken was, that the Oath is not averred to be made concerning

an Endictment lies. Roll chief Justice, Is the Endictment grounded upon the
Statute, or is it an Endictment at the Common Law? The Council answered, It is
an Endictment framed upon the Statute. Roll chief Justice, Then it is a
material exception, but if it had been an Endictment at the Common Law it would
have been otherwise, for at the Common Law one may be endicted for a false Oath

are Lords of the Leet; And if they be but Lords of the Manor, and not Lords of
the Leet, they are not bound of common right to repair the Stocks and Whipping

Custodes and Rickabye.
Mich. etc. 1652. Banc. sup.
Upon an old rule of this Court, made in the beginning of King Charles,
Arguments and Judgment whether a pardon for murder was well pleaded.
The Court was moved to deliver their opinion in the Case of Rickaby that had
been endicted for murder, and had obtained his pardon, whether the pardon was
good and to be allowed, or that he should be tried notwithstanding his pardon.
Roll chief Justice answered, This Case was argued often at the Bar 8 Caroli,
which was long ago, and before our times, therefore let us have books, and
argue it again, for we have yet heard no Arguments in the Case. At another day
by rule of Court the Case was again moved, and argued by Wadham Windham for the
Keepers, that the pardon was not good, nor ought to be allowed, because by the
pardon murder was not pardoned, and in his argument he made these questions,
viz. 1. Whether the King could pardon murder by the Common Law. 2. Whether he
might do it by the Law of God. 3. Whether he might do it by the Statute. 4.
Whether the pardon be made good by the non obstante included in it. For the
first, the King ex Officio may pardon Manslaughter by the Common Law, and in
some cases he might pardon murder, viz. Where there is but only malice employed
in the Murderer, but wilful murder he could not pardon, because it is
against the Law of God, and he cited 12 H. 8. f. 5. Brudenell. By the Law
delivered to Noah, Genesis ver. 6.
shedding of blood was made unpardonable, and that is a perpetual Law, Stat.
13. R. 2. C. 1. The King may delegate administration of Justice to his
Ministers, but not dispensation of mercy. By the Statute of 13 R. 2. c. 1. The
King was admonished not to pardon murder so generally as he used, but enacted,
That if in his pardons he did not express the word Murder, the pardon should
not be good, and the word Murder is not expressed in this pardon, and
therefore it is not good, nor to be allowed, 3 Instit. 236. 8 H. 6. 20. 9 H. 6.
8. Kel. 9 Nor does the King in this pardon recite the Endictment it self, for
then it may be it might have altered the Case, but only recites the fact
generally, and though the words in the pardon be general, and seem to include
murder, yet they cannot make the pardon good, because it wants the express
word it self, viz. Murder, and although the Charter be not void, yet it cannot
be allowed for want of that word, nor can the general non obstante in the
pardon dispense with the Statute of 13 R. 2. for all non obstantes are good
only where the King takes notice of the Law wherewith he dispenses. And as to
the Statute of 13 R. 2. First, By it the just power of the King is made
certain, and ought to be strictly pursued. 2ly. That Statute was made of grace,
and as a boon, to the people, in which they have a special interest, and is
not to be abridged. 3ly. It was made for the more free administration of
Justice, with which the King may not dispense, Hob. f. 214. Here and Lyliars
case 11 Rep. f. 88. And although the party here be prosecuted at the suit of
the King, yet the prosecution is for the benefit of the people, and therefore
the King cannot pardon him, 3 Inst. f. 337 and so he prayed the pardon might
not be allowed. Hales appointed by the Judges to argue ad informandum
conscientiam, as Windham also was, argued for Rickaby, that the pardon was to
be allowed, for the question now is not whether the pardon be to be granted or
no. And 2ly he held that here is a good non obstan^e in the pardon to dispense
with the Statute, and he argued that murder at the Common Law was pardonable
by other words, as well as by the word murder, viz. by the word Felony, and by
the word Death of a man, for murder is but Felony in a high degree, and majus
et minus non variant spe^iem, 4. rep. Holfords case, and the Statute of 13 R.
2. makes this clear, and that Statute is dispensed with by the non obstante.
For that Statute was not made to disable the King from pardoning murder, but
to direct and enform the King, and with that the King may dispense by a non
obstante, 16 R. 3. Tit. graunts, 34. and 5 Iac. in this Court, Bakers case. And
here is a dispensation by the Statute of R. 2. that this may be said a pardon
at the Common Law, for it appears by the words of the pardon, that the King
intended thereby to break through the Statute, and to pardon the party what
ever his offense was, for although the non obstante do not expess the word
murder, yet it is good, for there are equivalent words to murder in the
pardon, for the non obstante to dispense withal. As if the King grants a
pardon notwithstanding the Statute of Rich. 2. It is necessary to be referred
to that clause in the Statute, which is to be dispensed withal, and so is it
here, for there is no other end for the King to dispense with the Statute of R.
2. C. 13. but for this clause, and besides here is a special non obstante, and
not a general, and for authorityes he cited Stamford 101. pleas of the Crown,
236. and for presidents 31 Eliz. 4 Iac. 5 Iac. 6. Iac. and many others, and
said, that he found none against them. Roll chief Justice, Were it not for the
presidents I hold there would be but little question in the case; but some of
these questions have been debated in some times, although we cannot question
the King for granting such pardons, yet it is questionable whether he may grant
them by the Law of God; but the King may do it in some cases, Pardon.
but here is a Statute that says he shall not do it, if he do not take notice
of the fact in his pardon by the name of murder, and here is no such
expression, but the words are general; if the King pardon malum ^se with an non
obstante it is not good; But let us see Presidents, and we will advise till the
next Term. The next Term Roll chief Justice in the behalf of himself, and the
other Judges, delivered the opinion of the Court in this case to this effect.
We are all of one opinion, and my brothers have desired me to deliver the
reasons of th^irs, and my opinion. First I will open the Record, which in
effect is this, Rickaby was endicted at Durham for murder, and the endictment
was removed into this Court by a certiorari, and Rickaby brought hither by a
habeas corpus, and being demanded what he could say for himself, why he should
not be adjudged to die, he pleaded the pardon of the late King, which pardons
the death of Curtine in very general words; but the pardon does not express
the word murder, and in his plea he mentions not the Statute of 10 Ed. 3, by a
non obstante, and this is set forth for confirmation of his plea, and the
Statute of 13 R. 2. is alleged with a non obstante. The case in brief is,
Rickaby and others endicted for killing George Curtine, and brought bither
pleads his pardon, as is before expressed. The question is, whether the pardon
is to be allowed or not: This case has been well argued, and the like case
with this was never called into question, or argued before this, and therefore
if we shall not allow this pardon now, we have better reason to move us to it
than others have had to do the contrary, and therefore we shall send him into
the Country to receive Justice there for his offense, for we are all of one
opinion, that the pardon is not to be allowed, and that for these reasons, the
question here is not whether the King will pardon murder; but Cook says, the
King will not pardon it, if he know it to be murder; but the first question
is, whether the King can pardon murder without a non obstante: 2ly. Whether he
can do it with a special non obstante. 3ly. Whether he can pardon it by this
non obstante in this Charter of pardon. 4ly. Whether Rickaby has pleaded this
non obstante, so that he may take advantage of it. For the first point we do
not absolutely disallow the pardon; but we are to enquire whether here be
murder or not, it there be murder, that it may be disallowed, otherwise that
it may be allowed. Murder.
The Statute laws were made for preservation of the public peace, and to
restrain pardons for murder, so that after the making of the Statutes, murder
could not be pardoned without a non obstante in the pardon, though before it
might have been pardoned in general words. And the Parliament has made diverse
Statutes to restrain pardons, and that murder should not be so generally
pardoned as before. 2 E. 3. 4 E. 3. 14 E. 3. 27 E. 3. C. by which Statutes it
may appear, that the opinion was, that the King could not dispense with the
Statutes with a non obstante, and the end of all these Statutes was to enform
the King to examine whether the fact he intended to pardon was murder, and
that he should not grant a pardon for murder, without expressing the word
murder in the pardon, and with a non obstante also, Non obstante. Dispensation.
22 H. 7. 91. Kelway. 8 H. 6. f. 20. 9 E. 4. f. 26. Cook, Pleas of the Crown
236. and so the Law is, without a non obstante. 2ly. Whether the King can
pardon murder with a non obstante, where the word murder is not expressed. To
that I say, that if it had been so, yet the pardon would not have been good,
for the Statute cannot be dispensed with by a non obstante, because the Statute
was made to reform public abuses, for the benefit of the Commonwealth, 11.
rep. Cooks Pleas of the Crown, 237. the King cannot pardon a common nuisance.
2ly. The King has bound himself by express words in the Statute, and he
cannot dispense with them with a non obstante, for then such Statutes made for
the advancement of justice would be void, and the King cannot pardon a
recognisance for the peace before it is broken, and the King may bind himself
in such manner by express words, as my Lord Barkleyes case is, with the
Statute of 1 Iac. concerning Bishops the King cannot dispense, but with the
Statute of 1 and 13 Eliz. he may. Doctor Hutchinsons case, Mich. 10. Iac. C. B.
Hob. 103. the King cannot dispense with this Statute, because it was made for
the advancement of Justice. For the third point, though the King might dispense
with the Statute by a non obstante, yet not with this non obstante in this
pardon, for the King does not take notice of the offense in the non obstante,
and the King is deceived here, which the Law will not suffer, and here is a
hiding of the offense from the King, which is against the meaning of the
Statute. 2ly. This manner of pardoning is against all manner of practice for
two hundred years, and was never used till 2 Iac. but only in Spencers case,
which was carried with a strong hand, and allowed only pro hac vice, 21 Eliz.
by Popham the Attorney general by the special command of the Queen, and until
2 Iac. for 200. years no non obstante used of the Statute of 13 R. 2. but this
is grown up of late years, and a Judge of our own times has told me that he
has disallowed it. 3. Inst. 105. it has been used of late times to make a
lease of the parties life. viz. to respite execution until the time of 2 Iac.
and that allowance I formerly mentioned pro hac vice, may be questioned whether
it were good or no. For the fourth point the pleading of the pardon is not
good, for he has not pleaded a non obstante for the pardon of the murder, but
only to dispense with the binding to the good behavior, and the pardon is only
recited to prove the plea, and therefore it is not to be allowed. Therefore let
the Prisoner ire sine die, and let the matter be inquired in the County where
the fact was done. Yet we will consider whether he shall be tried in the
Country or here, in the mean time, Marshall cake care at your peril that you
keep him in salva custodia.

Newman and Massey.
Trin. 1653. Banc. sup.
NEwman brought an Action of debt upon an obligation against Massey as an
Executor; Special verdict in debt upon an obligation against an executor. Plea.
The Defendant pleads generally plene administravit, and after issue joined be
gives in evidence a Judgment against the Testator to make good his plea, upon
which a special verdict was found. The question thereupon was, whether this
Judgment may be given in evidence upon the late meal Act to maintain the
issue, or whether it should not have been pleaded specially in bar of the
Action. Roll chief Justice, The question is, whether the giving the Judgment
in evidence can stand with his plea of plene administravit, and it seems it
cannot, for now you show an administration in an other way than you pleaded
upon a new matter alleged. Adjourned. At another day Hales argued that a plene
administravit is a plea in Bar, although it be not a perpetual Bar, and it is a
general issue, because it compriseth many things which may be given in
evidence, 27 H. 7. 2. 11 H. 6. 35. and it is styled a general issue, Br. genesis

evidence non est factum, would it be good? certainly the Act for the general
issue in it self is mischievous, Issue.
and we will not enlarge it, and this is not the general issue intended in the
Statute, although it be a common issue, for the general issue intended, ought
to be an issue proper to the Action that is brought, and which he might have
pleaded at the beginning, and who can tell upon this plea what you will give in
evidence, Evidence.
and so the Plaintiff can never be provided for you at the trial, and therefore
you must rely upon your special plea of plene administravit, and not dary from
it by showing new matter. Therefore let the Plaintiff have his Judgment.

Atwood and Monger.
Trin. 1653. Banc. sup.
ATwood brought an Action upon the case against Monger, Arrest of Judgment in
an Action upon the case.
for causing a false presentment to be made against him before the conservators
of the River of Thames, for suffering 8. loads of earth to fall into the River
of Thames, and obteins a verdict; the Defendant moved in arrest of Judgment
that it does not appear by the Record what authority the conservators had to
take the presentment, and if they had no authority, then it was coram non
judice, and the Plaintiff could not be prejudiced by it. Twi^den answered it is
well enough, though their authority appears not by the Record, because they
have authority given them by the Statute of 13 R. 2. C. 9. which is a general
Law, and ought to be taken notice of; but if not, yet the Action is well
brought, for it is brought for the vexation the Plaintiff was put unto by
reason of the presentment, and the other matter alleged, is but by way of
inducement to the Action. 2. Car. in De^t and O^ifes case in this court so
held, and though the conservators had no authority, yet the Action lies for the
malicious prosecution, and for unjustly vexing him, and so adjudged. Trin. 16
Car. in this Court in Damon and Sheremans case. Hales on the other side said,
that this Court is not bound to take notice, that the Lord Mayor of London has
this jurisdiction of conservatorship, for the Statute which gave it him is a
particular Law touching him only, and so not to be taken notice of without it
be shown, and then if he have no such authority, all the proceedings against
the Plaintiff are void. Roll chief Justice, An Action upon the case lies for
bringing an appeal against one in the Common Pleas, though it be coram non
judice, Case.
by reason of the vexation of the party, and so it is all one whether here were
any jurisdiction or no, for the Plaintiff is prejudiced by the vexation, and
the conservators took upon them to have authority to take the presentment. And
I hold that an Action upon the case will lie, for maliciously bringing an
Action against one where he had no probable cause, and if such Actions were
used to be brought, it would deter men from such malicious courses as are to
often put in practice.

Sherecroft and Weeks.
Trin. 1953. Banc. sup.
SHerecrost brought an Action upon the case against Weeks, Arrest of Judgment
in an Action for words.
for speaking these words of him; He, meaning the Plaintiff, got Mary Nab with
Child, and the Child is his, and I have tried it with a sieve and a pair of
sheeres; It was moved in arrest of Judgment, that the latter words are
insensible, and so the Action not maintainable; to which it was answered, that
the first words are Actionable, and it matters not though the latter words be
nonsense, because they have no reference to the former words, and therefore
shall be rejected as senseless. But Sergeant Barnard on the other side said,
the latter words do take off the force of the former words, as the case is 4.
rep. f. 19. 2ly. It is not said here, when he got her with Child, Nor 3ly. Does
he aver that there was any such person as Mary Nab. Roll chief Justice, Case.
The Action does well lie, for the former words are positive scandalous words,
and the subsequent words are not material, and if they be, then they are in
confirmation of the former, for it seems he put confidence in the sieve and the
sheeres, and that made him speak the words, and it matters not whether his
confidence be true or false. Therefore Iudicium nisi pro Querente.

VVeldon and Strudder.
Trin. 1653. Banc. sup.
IT was moved to the Court that the Plaintiff after he had obtained a verdict,

Whitehead and Buckland.
Trin. 1653. Banc. sup.
THe case of Whitehead and Buckland was again spoken unto, Demurrer to a
replication in Trespass by Original.
which was this; Whitehead brought an Action of Trespass by original writ, for
taking his Cattle; the Defendant pleaded the Statute of limitations of Actions
in Bar; the Plaintiff replies that he took forth an original writ against the
Defendant for this Trespass within the time limited by the Statute, and upon
this replication the Defendant demurred, and for cause shows, that he does not
show what writ he sued forth, as he ought to do, otherwise it cannot be known
whether he be rightly thereby entitled to his Action or no. 2ly. He has not
showed the continuances upon his proceedings, and so it cannot be known whether
his Action be discontinued or no, that if it be we may take advantage thereof.
3ly. He does not say that he has taken out an Original, prout apparet per
Recordum, as he ought to do, for we do not agree the writ that he pleads he
has taken out. 4ly. He has concluded his plea, so that it amounts to a new
assignment, and hinders us from objecting against it by way of rejoinder, and
he joins an issue of his own head of a matter not alleged before, and 5ly. The
Action is for a Trespass done in 1645. and yet he concludes it to be contra
pacem publicam, which being in the late Kings time could not be, but ought to
have been contra coronam et dignitatem nostram. Latch on the other side said,
that both parties agree to the Original, and the disagreement is only in the
time of the execution thereof, and it is not necessary to say prout patet per
recordum; nor is it necessary to show the continuances of the process, for this
would make the Record too long, and here is no hinderance but they may rejoyn
if they have cause. P^^a. Error.
Roll chief Justice, As to the first Exception it is not necessary to set forth
the particulars of the writ, and if the writ be not good you may have a writ of
Error; and for the second exception, the plea is good without showing the
continuances, and there is no inconvenience by not setting them forth, and we
will intend that all is rightly done, because you have appeared, and you are
not hindered from replying, but may do it if you will, and have cause, and the
Record here shows that you have appeared to this writ; but it is not good to
conclude the plea super totam materiam as you have done, for by this he is
hindered from replying, and then he has good cause to demur, because you have
concluded him, and what say you to that? Latch, The party may strike out the
words Et querens similiter. Roll chief Justice, He cannot strike out that which
belongs not to him, Replication. Demurrer.
and you cannot go back, and the other is compelled to demur. Therefore, Nil
capiat per Billam nisi, etc. or waive the Demurrer, Postea.

Peck and Ewre.

Pasch. 1653. rot. 116, or 117.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a judgment given in an Action of debt
for rent arrear upon two leases for years, Error to reverse a judgment in debt
for rent.
viz. upon a lease for 3 years of diverse Copyhold Lands, and upon a lease for
31 years for other lands. Howell assigns for Error. 1. That the Declaration is
not good, because that it is for an entire rent reserved for 2 several terms,
whereas one of the terms is expired, and here cannot be made any apportionment
of the rent, because it appears not which of the lands are Copyhold, and which
are Free lands. Roll chief Justice, He ought to show how much of the lands are
Copyhold, and how much Freehold. Hales, Here is but one entire rent reserved,
and it shall be paid as well after the expiration of the Copyhold lands as
before. Roll chief Justice, Discontinuance.
Then for what term shall the rent be reserved? for it does not appear to us,
Therefore you were best to discontinue your action, otherwise if we give
judgment upon the Exception taken, you may lose your rent.

Hill and Dechair.
Trin. 1653. Banc. sup.
AN Action of debt was brought for 5 l. for selling of Wine without License,
Arrest of judgment in an Action upon the Statute for selling wine without
license.
and a Verdict was found for the Plaintiff. It was moved in Arrest of Judgment,
That the Action is not well brought, because it is not by Original, as it ought
to be by the Statute of 18 Eliz. Wild on the other side answered, that it is
not necessary to be by Original; for a Bill of debt as this is, is in the
nature of an Original writ, if it should be otherwise the Statute would be
repugnant: for the debt one by Statute may be recovered in this Court by
Information, and this is the usual practice of this Court. Twisden took a
difference between a penal Action, and a popular Action; A penal Action he said
may be by Bill, but not a popular Action. 2ly. It is not showed that the party
was not licensed to sell Wine. 3ly. The Verdict finds him guilty for selling of
5 pints of Wine between such a time and such a time, Relation. Action.
part where of was before the Information brought, and part after the
Information brought. To the last exception, Roll chief Justice answered, The
matter shall relate to the filing of the Bail, for then the Action begins,
and not before. But what say you to the other Exception? Wild, That is
mistaken, for the Action is upon another branch of the Statute. Roll chief
Justice, By an original Action it is meant in the Statute that the offense
shall not be tried upon a plaint in an Inferior Court, and not to distinguish
it from an information; for a Writ and Bill is all one in this Court, Stat. 2
R. 3. A Bill is not an Original writ, Writ. Bill.
but an original Action, and it is the common practice to sue in this Court, in
this manner. But we will advise. At another day the Court was moved for
judgment, because the Action is well brought, though it be not brought by
original, and the Case urged of Winston against it is not to the purpose, for
that Case was not upon an information, as our Case is, but it was brought by
the party grieved to recover his treble damages, and in that case the party did
not pursue the manner of suing for them as the Statute directed, but we have
here done it, and it is the constant practice of this Court. Twisden answered,
that Winstons case is not answered; for that was a popular Action, as our case
is. Roll chief Justice, The question here is, whether there be an original
Action or not upon the Statute of 18 Eliz. C. 5. And I say it does not appear
whether that Statute meant to out this Court of its Jurisdiction or not, but it
is left at large in the Statute, and me thinks it is an original Action,
Jurisdiction.
and Plats Case is, that an original Action may be by Bill, And I conceive the
Statute intended only to exclude inferior Courts, and the constant course is,
that the party being in Custodia Marescalli he may be proceeded against by
Bill, and we will not suffer this Court to be excluded from its jurisdiction by
obscure words in the Statute, Therefore let judgment be for the Plaintiff,
nisi, etc.

Ricott and St. John.
Trin. 1653. Banc. sup.
IN Action of Trespass an Ejectment brought by Ricott against St. John, Motion

the Court was moved for a third person, that he will save the Defendant
harmless, and prays that giving him security so to do, the Defendant may be
ordered by the rule of this Court to plead as he should direct him, and that he
be not suffered to confess a judgment. Roll chief Justice, It is out of the
way for you to give such security, for there yet appears no collusion, But you
shall be made a party to defend the title, and then move again.

Trin. 1653. Banc. sup.
IN the Case of one Clark it was said by Roll chief Justice, Where a day is

the submission, the day of the Award is to be taken inclusive and not
exclusive, so that if the Award be made the same day on which the submission
was, it is a good Award.

feasant in D. the Defendant justifies in another County, Whether a Traverse was
well taken.
and traverseth absque hoc, that he is guilty in D. or in any other place. The
question was whether the traverse be well taken or not. Roll chief Just
answered, he must take a traverse as this case is, because the justification is
local: Traverse Discontinuance.
Therefore let the Plaintiff take nothing by his Bill, for he may not
discontinue his Action because it is in Trespass. Nota.

Fletcher and King.
Trin. 1653. Banc. sup.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a judgment given in the Common Pleas
in an Action of debt (...) ^^^ght upon an assumpsit to save one harmless, Error
to reverse a Judgment in debt upon an Assumpsit.
in disposing of certain good ^s^ised by an Order of the Commissioners of
Haberdashers Hall; (...) ^^sendant (...) that he had saved him harmess; The
Plaintiff replied that he was damnified, the Defendant rejoyns by protestation,
that there was no Order of Haberdashers Hall, for plea says, non damnificatus,
and upon this the Plaintiff demurred in the Common Pleas, and a judgment was
given there upon the Demurrer for the Plaintiff. In the writ of Error here the
Error assigned was, that the rejoinder is a departure from the plea, and here
it does not appear that John Pitcher named in the replication is the same John
Pitcher that is named in the Declaration, for it is said quidem Johannes
Pitcher, and not the said I. Pitcher. Latch said, This is not material, whether
he be the same or no; but upon the entire matter it does appear that he is the
same person, for there is an averment afterward that makes it so appear, viz.
That it is the same person and goods mentioned in the plea, and in the
condition made upon delivery of the goods, and it cannot be otherwise
understood, and their bar is naught both in matter and in form also, for he is
to be saved harmless of goods. Hale on the other side makes a difference
between saying one I. P. and saying I. P. and saying of diverse goods, and
saying of goods generally; and the goods mentioned here cannot relate to the
goods mentioned in the condition, and though the plea be not good it matters
not, for the replication assigns not a breach. Roll chief Justice, If your plea
be not good, then the Declaration is not answered. Traverse. Intendment. Bar,
Replication.
It may be intended the same person, yet it is not well expressed to say quidam
I. P. for how can a traverse be taken upon an intendment? nor does it appear
they are the same goods but by intendment, so that the bar is ill, and the
replication also. Affirmetur nisi, etc. Nota.

Ashby and Child.
Trin. 1653. Banc. sup.
Mich. 1652. rot. 686.
Upon a Demurrer in an Action of debt the case was this, A man died intestate,
and a Stranger possesses himself of the Intestates goods after Letters of
Administration were granted to a Creditor of the Intestate, who brings an
Action of debt against the stranger for the debt due to him by the Intestate,
as Executor of his own wrong. The question was, whether the Creditor by taking
the Letters of Administration had not suspended his Action for the time he
should continue to be Administrator. Twisden held that his Action is suspended,
and cited 8 Rep. St. John's case, because the goods of the Intestate shall be
assets in his hands, Hob and Longs case; and the Plaintiff is at no prejudice,
for he may recover the goods by an Action of Trover or Trespass, 12 H. 4. f.
21. Hales on the other side held that the Action is not suspended; for though
he may bring Trespass or a Trover and Conversion for the goods, yet they are
not assets till they are recovered, and a Creditor may bring an Action against
an Executor de son tort, although Letters of Administration be granted to
another, and the subsequent administration does not suspend the Action which
accrued before, and here can be no retainer to satisfy himself, because he
has not the goods, and it is not the bare Letters of administration that
charge the Administrator, but the Assets also, Com. 7. Bassets case, An
Action of debt is maintainable by an Administrator who has not assets. Roll
chief Justice, There is a book against that, that the heir is not chargeable.
Hales prima facie, It is a good plea, otherwise it would be mischievous, for
all the goods may be wasted before he has administration granted him; and
though he may bring an action of Trespass for the goods, yet he may bring his
Action to which he was entitled before the administration granted unto him.
Trover and Conversion.
Roll chief Justice, It is clear the Administrator may bring a Trover and
Conversion for the goods, and here is but a right to assets in the
Administrator, Assets.
and no assets to charge him withal, and it would be mischievous if it should
be otherwise; and the granting unto him Letters of Administration hinders him
not from bringing his Action, because the goods were not taken away after the
Administration granted but before, Trespass. Debt.
and if they had been taken away afterward, he might have had a Trover and
Coversion, or an Action of Trespass, but in the case at the Bar he may have an
Action of debt, and he cannot sue himself, therefore his Action is not
suspended, Suspension. Retainer.
and he cannot retain the goods to satisfy himself, because he has no goods,
and he may sue the heir here if he will, and he shall not take advantage
against him by reason of the administration, because he has no assets to
retain or sue himself for, and so it is in his election what Action he will
bring, Election.
otherwise it would be dangerous, and we must support men in their just
Actions. Ierman, Nicholas and Ask ad idem. And so judgment was given for the
Plaintiff, nisi.

not against an Executor.
there being no express Covenant therein for the payment of the rent. The
question was, whether this Action did lie against the Executor. Latch argued
that it did not lie, because it is a mere Covenant in Law comprised only in the
words yielding and paying, and not an express Covenant, and so only binds the
Testator, but not the Executor. But Roll chief Justice answered, That an Action
of Covenant does lie against an Executor upon a Covenant in Law, Covenant.
Executor.
although he be not named, but it is otherwise of an heir, for he is not bound
by such a Covenant. And the reservation of the rent here does seem to be an

Townsend and Barker.
Mich. 1653. Banc. sup.
Trin. 1653. rot. 743.
TOwnsend brought an Action upon the Case against Barker, Arrest of judgment
in an action for words.
that had been a Copartner with him in trade, for speaking these words of him,
You are a cosening Knave, and did cosen me of 1200 l. at one time, and that was
in making an account in the year 1648. Upon a verdict for the Plaintiff, it was
moved in arrest of Judgment that the words are not actionable, because though
they he spoken of a Tradesman, yet they are not spoken of him in reference to
his Trade, but in reference to an Account, and although by way of reduction and
consequence they may reflect upon his honesty, yet they are not actionable, and
though his reputation be impaired by speaking them, yet he cannot be endicted
for cosening in his Trade by reason of them, because they are spoken of a
singular and particular abuse, and not of a general cosening used in his Trade,
and an Action upon the Case lies not for words which are only scandalous by way
of reduction, and if the words should hinder the party to get a Partner
hereafter to trade with him, yet he may use his Trade, and so cannot be
prejudiced: nor are the words that he cheated him, but that he cosened him,
which are not of so violent a construction. Wild on the other side said, that
here is a Partnership which is necessary to the driving of a Trade, and without
which it cannot be so well driven, and the Account is incident to all
Partnerships, and prayed for Judgment. Roll chief Justice. If the
Copartnership continued, the words were actionable without doubt, for then they
must be spoken of him in the way of his Trade: Case.
but here the Partnership being ended makes the matter more considerable; but

Upon a special Verdict in an Action of Trespass and Ejectment, Special Verdict
in a Trespass and Ejectment.
the Case in effect was this, One whose Surname was Mills seized of
Gavelkind-lands in Kent in fee, by his last Will and Testament devised these
Lands to Elizabeth his Daughter in tail, with a Proviso in the Will, that if
his Daughter Elizabeth did mary one of his own Surname that then she should
have the Lands in fee-simple. Elizabeth married one whose Surname was Mill, but
commonly called and known by the name Mills also. The question was, whether she
had married one of such a Surname, where^^ according to the Proviso in the Will
she had a fee-simple in the Lands ^evised unto her, or whether his Surname
should be accounted a distinct name from the Testators, so that Elizabeth by
the Will could only have an Estate in tail in the Lands devised unto her. It
was argued first, that the name Mill and Mills shall not be said to be one and
the same name, no more than if she had married one of a clear differing Surname
in sound, yet commonly called also Mills, could she have been said to have
married one of his own Surname, and the Proviso here is not a particular
pointing out of the person whom his Daughter should mary, but a general
limitation directing her to mary one of his own Surname, and this ought to have
been punctually followed, because the name was used to induce the affection of
the Devisor to enlarge the estate given by him. If he had devised his Land to
his Daughter E. if she shall mary a Protestant or an Earl, she must mary one
that is really so, and not one called or only reputed so. And as to the
objection, that this construction would make contrariety in the Will, which is
not to be admitted; this will not be, if the Will be taken compositive as it is
penned, or together, and not abstractive and taken to pieces, and if it should
not be intended that she should mary one who in truth was of his name there
would be a contradiction in the Will; and here is an Emphasis in the word Own,
which must be meant his real name, and not of a reputative name. Roll chief
Justice, If a Iuror be returned by the name of Mills, and is sworn by the name
of Mill, shall this be a mistryal, quasi non? and the words found alike as
Baxter and Backster. At an other day the Case was put again by Hales, and
argued for the Plaintiff, and he made diverse points in the Case, but I could
not well hear him: but the only point insisted on was the point formerly spoken
to, and the sum of his Argument was, that we are in this Case upon the
construction of a Will, which must be favorably taken, and the variation here
betwixt Mills and Mill is small and inconsiderable to defeat an Estate, for it
is only in the termination of the word, and is as little as the difference
between Baxter and Backster, or Hasting and Hastings, 9 E. 4.42, 44 Eliz. Molyn
and Molyns, or Pit and Pitts, which differ but in one letter, and is not a
material difference. 2ly. It appears by the Verdict that he was commonly called
Mill and Mills, and common reputation we know does give names to things. 3ly.
It is found that he was known by one name as well as the other, and this will
satisfy the Testators intent well enough to carry the Estate. 4ly. The party
himself was known to the Testator at the time of the making of the Will by the
name of Mills, as appears in eight several places of the Will. And if one
devise Lands and Goods, and excepts one Lease, if there be other Leases they
are devised. 5ly. It appears by the Will and the Verdict, that the marriage was
intended by the Father with this very person that is called Mills, and a
settlement of Lands made upon it, and it shall not be intended that the
Testator thought that this marriage would be dissolved and another marriage be
had. And the devise in the body of the Will does not make the Proviso in the
end of the Will repugnant, but if it did the last repugnancy shall stand: for
here is no dependancy of the last Proviso upon the other part of the Will, but
it is a substantine clause which revokes not the other, Doctor Buts Case, 10
Rep. and this shall be counted his last Will, and it is the more strong,
because it appears by the very words, that it is a plain substantive clause
made to declare the new intent of the Testator, and it shall not be intended
that this Proviso shall be applied to another person, although there be a
particular title given to him by the Will, and the Estate altered by the
Proviso, and the former devise is derogated by it, Hob. 2d. Case, Harding Case,
and the strength of the Proviso to have one of the true name of Mills is not to
be intended, for it appears that the intent of the Testator was, to have one of
his name in reputation, and this appears by the former limitation in the Will,
and the provision made in the last Proviso to preserve his name, is no more
than that he had done before: and the former limitation is as well for the
Testators advantage as the latter Proviso, and more, and his intent was not to
sell the Lands, but to preserve them, and it is no more to say of my own
Surname, than to say of my Surname, nor is the videlicet any thing to the
purpose. Roll chief Justice, if the question were only upon the Proviso, there
would be no difficulty but that Mill and Mills should be all one, and it would
be good in a Conveyance also, as I suppose, and if it were apparent that he
intended one and the same person, Proviso.
then the last Proviso would be good to revoke the former part of the Will: but
the doubt is, whether he intend the same person or not, because he makes such
an alteration of the Estate by the Proviso, and puts these words mine own name
in it, by which it seems he intended to advance his own name, and he seems
exact in it by the great alteration of the Estate made by the Proviso in the
settlement of the Estate. At another day the Case was again moved and argued by
Wadham Windham, that Mills and Mill are both one name, and differ but in sound,
as Abacock and Habacock, and the Verdict finds that both the names are his true
Surname, though it could not be so in Christian names, 6 Rep. 66. Sirnames are
altered by time and Custom of places, and being so altered do become true names,
as the name of Cromwell. is now become a true name, though anciently the name
was Williams; but I agree, that Christian names cannot be altered by time, no
more than things can be altered from one thing to another. 3ly. By the
construction of the Will, and by the finding of the Verdict, the names are made
one name, although by the Testator he was known by no other name than the name
of Mills, for he is so called, and this answers the Proviso in the Will, that
he should be of his own Surname with whom his Daughter was to mary. 4ly. Here
is a particular devise made to her in the body of the Will of the Lands, if
they should not be devised here, 8 Rep. Clausa generalia non extendunt ad ea
quae sunt specialiter recitata; and there is a difference between a Will and a
Deed, for all the words in a Deed are spoken together: but it is not so in a
Will which is ambulatory, and may have several constructions, and one clause
may control another, Instit. 11 2. and the Proviso here in the last part of
the Will controlls the former part of the Will, as a Codicil might have done,
if there had been any, and the very words express the parties meaning, 1 Rep.
Porters Case, Dyer 255. If in a Will a clause may receive a doubtful
construction, then a verbis non est recedendum, nor shall there be a particular
supplyment of words added to expound it, except to prevent an absurdity, which
must not be admitted, though in a Will. Maynard on the other side made two
questions. 1. Whether Mills and Mill should be intended to be one and the same
Surname, and so to be the Testators Surname. 2ly. Whether Elizabeth take the
Lands by the first clause in the Will, or by the Proviso or latter clause. For
the first he held, that Mills and Mill is not one and the same Surname, because
the Testator had a particular eye to his own true Surname, and the Cases put of
names that differ, yet sound alike, do not come to our Case, because there was
no such special eye or regard as here is, 2ly. Suppose that his true name be
Mills, and that he is provided for particularly by the Testator in his Will,
then the Proviso cannot extend to him, for this would be senseless, and it is
as much as to make the Testator in one breath to speak contradictories, and it
would be hard to make such constructions of such words that would argue the
party to be irrational that spoke them, and the words in the Proviso are in
nature of an exception in construction of Law, 12 Ed. 1. Fitzh. Grants 87. and
Carter and Ringsteeds Case is not yet answered by the other side, Bolton and
the Lady Staffords case, 8 Iac. C. B. 1. rep. Mildmayes Case. The words in a
Proviso in a Will or Deed may be supplied with other words, rather than to
interpret it so, that it shall contradict the former part of the Will or Deed
where it is, and by the construction that we make of the Proviso all the Will
may stand together, but by another construction it cannot. Elizabeth shall have
a special entayl with her Husband by the last clause, and yet the general
Estate tail given in the former part shall stand; and we are in the
interpretation of Wills to consider circumstances and conjectures, and there
are two publications found in this will, although this does not appear upon
Record, and so comes not in judgment. Roll chief Justice, We are all of one
opinion, that judgment ought to be given for the Defendant. If the first
clause in the Will continue uncontrolled by the Proviso, it is for the
Defendant, but if it continue not uncontrolled it is for the Plaintiff, and we
hold that the first clause is not controlled, for we ought not to make any part
of a Will void, if all the parts of it may stand together, and this cannot be
here if the Proviso should control the former part, Revocation.
and to make it repugnant, but if the Proviso could stand with the former part
of the Will it might revoke the former part, and if this Proviso had been made
after the Will, it might have altered the Case, but that appears not; And we
must collect the Testators meaning by the Will, Intention.
and by the Will it cannot be understood that the Proviso should be void, and
the common reputation of Mill and Mills to be the same name, shall not make
Mill to be the Testators true Surname, and the Testator intended his Daughter
should marry one of his own true Surname, and not one of his reputative name,
for this is a special case, and goes not according to the ordinary rules of
names that sound alike, and it cannot be intended that the Testator did mean to
destroy one part of his will by another part. A general clause in a grant shall
not extend to a particular thing provided for in the grant, much less shall it
do so in a Will. Therefore let judgment be for the Defendant, nisi.

for speaking these words of her, There was a man killed in her house, and she

her to be fined and imprisoned. Roll chief Justice, Fine. Imprisonment.
She shall not be fined and imprisoned except she receive and comfort the party
that killed him, but the words are scandalous, and the Case differs from the
Cases put on the other side. Twisden for the Defendant urged, that it was not
averred that the Plaintiff did know of the murder. Roll chief Justice, The
words imply she knew of the murder, for how else could she be said to conceal
it. Bowlstrode for the Defendant said, That it does not appear by the Record
that any man was killed in the house, nor any time when, nor is it said the
Defendant spoke the words of the Plaintiff, Case.
but only by an innuendo. Roll chief Justice, The words are actionable to say
that thou have murdered a man, without averring that he is killed; but if it
appear by the Declaration that the man was alive after the words spoken, it is
otherwise; And here if no man be murdered the feigning of a false thing makes
the words the more actionable, by saying she concealed a murder, where there
was in truth no murder done; But the greatest doubt here is, whether because
admitting a murder were done, the Plaintiff is to be but fined and imprisoned
for the concealing it, the words can be actionable; And I hold they are
actionable notwithstanding, because they are scandalous; Endictment.

reverse a judgment in debt for rent.
as being Administrator to I. S. and declares for rent due since the death of
the Intestate, and has a verdict and a judgment in the Common Pleas. Drake
brings his writ of Error here to reverse this judgment. The Exception taken
was, that it does not appear by the Declaration whether this rent sued for does
belong to the Administrator or not, for he makes himself no title to it, and
for ought does appear it may belong to the heir and not to him. Wadham Windham
on the other side, This is no Exception now after a Verdict, but if it had been
upon a Demurrer it would have been good, and we do not declare that the
Intestate was seized in see who made the lease, and so it may well be
understood, that he had but a lease of this land, and did let an under lease to
the Defendant; and the better construction shall be made for us. Hales on the
same side said, non detinet is pleaded, and the Jury has sound detinet, which
would be impossible if the Intestate had been seized in fee, and there is a
double intendment that the rent is reserved upon a lease, for it is reserved to
Executors, and not the heir. Maynard on the other side said, the Verdict helps
nothing, because the Declaration is naught in substance in our case; for the
Plaintiff therein has made himself no title to the rent, and all that is in the
Declaration to entitle him is expressed but by way of inference or conclusion,
and for the reserving the rent to the Executors, this had been good if the rent
had grown due during the time of the Intestate. The Court moved the parties,

trial might be had by consent, which was agreed unto, and so ruled.

BEdwell brought an Action upon the case against Fenwick, Arrest of judgment
in an Action upon a promise.
and declares that the Defendant, in consideration that the Plaintiff would
marry E. his Sister, he would give his Sister 300 l. for her marriage portion,
upon his marriage with her, and for breach of this promise brings his Action,
and obtains a verdict against the Defendant. The Defendant in Arrest of
Judgment urged, that the breach assigned in the Declaration was not well
assigned, for it recited another promise than upon which the Plaintiff had
declared, for he declares of a promise made to give 300 l. in marriage to the
Plaintiff with his Sister E. and he assigns the breach in not paying the 300 l.
unto the Plaintiff, so that the breach does not answer the promise, for if the
money be paid to the wife, which for ought appears may be, the promise is not
broken though she be married. But Hale (...) other side said, that it is all one
as it is alleged, and that it is equ^^^^ and reciprocal, and here is a refusal
to pay the money, assigned for a breach, and this is a good breach. Roll chief
Justice, I suppose it is all one as if he had expressed the very words of the
promise, for the Husband is to give the acquittance for the money, Acquittance.
and the moneys are to be paid unto the Husband, and the Verdict finds that
they are not paid: And if moneys be due to a Feme upon a Contract dum sola
suit, and after, and before the payment thereof she marry, the moneys are to be
paid to the Husband, and not the wife, Payment.
and the moneys here are intended to be paid for a marriage portion, which does
properly belong to the husband, and they were not to be paid unto her before
the marriage, and it is all one in this Case as if the Plaintiff had said, that
the Defendant had not paid the moneys to the Husband with his Wife in marriage;
Curia ad idem, The Rule thereupon was, that the Plaintiff should take his
judgment, nisi.

moved in Arrest of Judgment, that the words are not actionable, because they
are but words of choler, and very general words, and may receive diverse
constructions, and at the first moving the judgment was stayed; but the matter
being moved again at another day, Roll chief Justice said, that these words
import more than the bare calling of a woman whore, by reason of other
particular circumstances set forth to aggravate the matter, and therefore let

him in relation to his being a Churchwarden; But it was answered, That a
Churchwarden is an Officer of Trust, and taken notice of by the Common Law, and
so was it adjudged in Stroade and Homes his Case in this Court, and the words
must be intended to be spoken of him in the relation to his Office, for that is
employed by his making of Lowns and his couzening the Parish. The rule was for

AN Action of Debt was brought by Boil against Scarborough, Error in reverse a
judgment in Debt upon a Promise.
wherein the Plaintiff did declare, that the Defendant in consideration that
the Plaintiff would forbear to sue forth a ne exeat regnum against the
Defendants Son, who did owe unto the Plaintiff five hundred pound, did assume
and promise unto the Plaintiff a certain sum of money expressed in the
Declaration, upon non assumpsit pleaded, and a verdict and a judgment given
for the Plaintiff, the Defendant brought a Writ of Error, and it was assigned
for Error; That there appears no consideration to ground the promise upon, and
so no ground of Action, for he does not show that he had done any thing in
prosecuting the Writ of ne exeat regnum, and Rolyer and Langdales Case 1650. in
this Court was cited, and Hob. 216. Bedwell and Cottons case, and there is no
such Writ in the Register, as a ne exeat regnum, and therefore there could be
no forbearance to sue out such a Writ, but there is a Writ to give security not
to go out of the Realm to the public prejudice of the King and his people,
and here is no such matter expressed, but only that his Son owed him 500 l. and
Not. Brev. 85. was agreed; and it was farther objected by Wild who argued
against the Judgment, that though the consideration should be good, yet the
replication is not good and sufficient to tie the second Writ to the first: for
it is not said that the second Writ is pro una and eadem causa, and so it is
uncertain, Br. Trespass 85. 9 H. 6, and there may be several promises made in
one day, and if the replication is good, yet the rejoinder is not good, 19 H.
8.43. for he only admits, that he being a Knight is the same person which was
sued by the name of Esquire, Hob. 171. Stukelyes Case. And here is a judgment
by a Nihil dicit; and no warrant of Attorney, for it is Latin, and so it is null,
it being since the late Act made for the proceedings in Law to be in English.
Latch on the other side prayed that judgem^nt might be affirmed, and said, that
here was a good consideration to ground the promise upon, for there is a Writ
of ne exeat regnum, and any one may move for it, and it is a benefit to the
party, that the Plaintiff will forbear to sue it forth, and he had cause enough
here to move for this Writ in order to recover his debt, and although it be in
the discretion or the King, whether he will grant it or not, yet it is for his
honor to grant it, and the Register 193.134. and Brit. 102. make montion of
this Writ, Instit. 130. There is a caution used to be taken of parties licensed
to go beyond Seas, that they shall pay their debts. 2ly. The replication is
good, for it is not necessary to say, that the second original sued forth is
for the same cause that the former was, because it is in an Action upon the
Case set forth at large, which shows verbatim that it is for the same cause,
and so it is plain in it self. 2ly. It is said, that he sued out the second
Original pro causa praedict^, which is a sufficient averment, if there needed
any, and the variance in the damage is no argument that there is another cause
of Action, for when the second Original was sued forth, the damages were
increased by the increase of the time, being a whole year afterward. For the
rejoinder, it is to be considered, 1. whether the party be assopped. 2ly. If
not, whether the matter set forth be good. For the first he held, that he is
estopped by his coming in formerly gratis as an Esquire, and being not brought
in in custody, for Dyer, 192. there he shall not plead another name: but here
this is not alleged as it ought to be, for he ought to have concluded absque
hoc, that he is an Esquire, but he has affirmed himself to be an Esquire, by
saying of praedictus, etc. and he ought to have alleged this specially, viz.
that Richard Boil Knight, which was sued by the name of Richard Boil Esquire;
and the Book 2 E. 4. f. 3. is against the other Books, and the Law is
otherways, and the old Book of Entries, and other Presidents which are against
me, they passed sub silentio, and the Law generally is against these
Presidents, Rastal Brief. 54.19 H. 6.1.36.44. say, that he is estopped if he so
come in, and so is Br. Tit. Defense, 15 and 26.32 H. 6.3.35 H. 6. and many
other Books; and the Book of 19 H. 6.43. urged on the other side is against
them; and though he should not be estopped, yet we can take advantage of the
first Original, for it is but abateable by the Misnosiner, and is not abated,
and there is a slaw in the rejoinder, for he ought to have traversed that he
was not an Esquire. And 2ly. the 26th. of March is after the Original sued
forth, and it is uncertain as to the time when he was a Knight, Plowd. 27. by
Morgan 7. H 7.5. a And the Warrants of Attorney are good, though they be in
Latin, and if they were in English they would be erroneous, and the nonentry of
them is not material, for the constant practice is not to enter the Warrant of
Attorney before the Issue, Trin. 8 Iac. Morley and Morley in this Court: here
is not the entry o^ the Warrant it self, but only an entry that he is Attorney
by Warrant, and so he prayed the affirmance of the judgment. Roll chief
Justice, If one bring a Writ of 1000 l. and it be abated, and brings another
Writ for the same debt, Damages.
can you increase the damages accrued between the first and the second Writ?
It cannot be, for the second is but the reviving of the first Writ, and not a
new Writ; but here are diverse points considerable, and fit to be spoken unto A
ne exeat regnum is a Writ usually sued forth although that originally it was
only used in Cases of State businesses therefore the forbearance to sue it
forth is a good consideration. Writ.

thereby she was barred by the Statute of limitations of A^tions to bring her
Action, Jason the Father might now bring his Action upon the Case for the
damage done to him by the loss of his Daughters service, or should be also
barred by the Statute. Powis argued, that he was not barred though the Daughter
was, because in many cases the Law gives two Actions for one thing, and cited
19 H. 6.45, 46. a. and Hill. 1649. Norburies case adjudged in this Court, and
said, that though the Trespass and the Assault was done to the Daughter, yet
here is a per quod servitium amisit declared of, which does belong to Jason the
Father. Roll chief Justice, This Action is an Action brought for the damage
done to the Master, and though the servant will release the battery, yet the
Master may have an A Aion for the damage caused to him by the Battery, and
although the Daughter cannot have an Action, her Father may, although not for
entering into his house, because it was with his leave, nor for assaulting his
Daughter, and getting her with child, because this is a wrong particularly done
to her, yet for the loss of her service caused by this, he may have an Action,
but it is a pretty case, and fit to be argued, therefore bring us books, and we
will advise upon it. At another day the case was again spoken unto by Baldwin
of the Inner Temple on the Defendants part, and he made the question to be,
whether this be an Action of Trespass vi et armis, or an Action upon the Case
which is here brought, and he argued that it is a Trespass vi et armis, and
not an Action upon the Case which is here brought, Case.
and cited Not. Brev. 86. and 17 Ed. 3. and 12 H. 4. and the 9 Rep. the Earl of
Shrewsbury case, and said, that the matter here alleged is not Causa causans,
but Causa causata, and he agreed that one may be liable to diverse Actions for
one Trespass in diverse respects, but here all the matter is jumbled together,
and it cannot be an Action upon the Case, for the judgment ought to be quod
defendens capiatur, which is the Judgment in a Trespass vi et armis, and not
in a Trespass upon the Case, Hob. Rep. Wheatly and Stones Case, And although
the Action conclude with a per quod servitium amisit, yet it sounds more in
Trespass than to be an Action upon the case and then he is barred by the
Statute of limitations, for not bringing it within 4 years, and here are ^ntire
damages also given for all, which ought not to be, for the Defendant was a
sojourner in the Plaintifs house, and had license to enter into it, and by
consequence is is not guilty of the vi et armis declared, of Hob. Andrews and
de la hope, 22 Eliz. Dyer 369. 20 Iac. Rhetoric and Chapels Case, and
therefore no damages ought to have been given for the domum fregit, because he
entered with License. Roll chief Justice. It may be the entire damages are
given by the Jury, for the trespass, of which they make doubt and refer to the
judgment of the Court, and not for the entering with License: but if the entire
special matter had been found and left to the Court, it had been otherwise. But
if they had not made a doubt, they might have found him culpable, Damages.
and so I doubt that it is not good to find the damages entire, because as to
the Trespass for entering vi and armis he is not guilty. But for the other point
the cause of action is per quod servitium amisit, and for this he has brought
it within the time limited by the Statute, for it is an Action upon the Case,
although the causa causans is the vi and armis which is but inducement to the
Action, and the causa causats, viz. the loss of the service is the ground of
the Action. Hales e contra said, that the damages shall be applied to the
other matter. Roll chief Justice, this is the sole Question, whether the
damages refer to all the Trespass or not, and upon reading the Record he said,
that it referred to all, Venire. Trial.
and so is not good. The rule was to show cause why a new Venire should not
issue forth to try the matter de novo.

Mich. 1653. Banc. sup.
THe Court was moved to quash an order of Sessions made for the committing of
one Wade and another, Surveyours of the Highway, To quash an order of Sessions.
until they should pay the arrerages of money collected by them upon the
Statute of 2 and 3. Phil. and Mar. C. 8. for amending of Highways, and it was
prayed the Prisoners might be bayled. These exceptions were taken by Twilden
against the Order, first to the Mittimus, in that the parties were not
convicted before the Justices as they ought to have been. 2ly. The Mittimus is
repugnant in it self, for they are committed for not paying of illegal rates
levied upon the Parishioners, and if they be illegal they are not to be paid.
Next they are committed for not paying all the money by them levied, whereas
they are to deduct 8 d. in the pound out of it for their pains in collecting of
it, and so they are committed for more than is due. Roll chief Justice, The
order is not good, yet let them on the other side take time to maintain it if
they can, because it is an order for repairing of the Highway, Order of
Sessions.
which is for the good of the Common wealth.

A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a judgment in an Ejectione firmae; it

in an Ejectione firmae.
that the Record was not yet transcribed, and therefore prayed he might amend
the judgment by making it recuperet instead of recuperare debet, because it
was only the fault of the Clark in mis-entring. Roll chief Justice, This is a
matter of substance, and we cannot tell whether the judgment be final or not.
If it be not final it ought to be recuperare debeat: Amendment, Judgment.
but if it be final, it ought to be recuperet. Therefore we will make no rule
in it.

BY Roll chief Justice, Upon what promise an Action lies, Averment.
If one make a lease for years of land, rendering rent, and after the Lessee
promises the Lessor to pay the rent, an Action lies upon this promise, if the
promise was made at the time of the Lease made, but in the Action brought this
promise must be expressly averred to be so.

Bocking and Symons.
Hill. 1654. Banc. sup.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a judgment given in the Commmon Pleas,
Error to reverse a judgment in the Common Pleas.
and the Error assigned was, that the Action was brought against 3 persons, one
of whom was within age, and that they all appeared by Attorney, whereas he
within age ought to have appeared by his Guardian, and so the Judgment was
erroneous as to him, and consequently to the rest because it was a joint
Judgment. Roll chief Justice, Judgment.
This is a good exception, for it being a joint judgment, if it be naught in
part, as without doubt it is, it is naught in the whole, And so it was reversed.

Hill. 1653. Banc. sup.
THe Court was moved to quash an Endictment for not repairing a Highway. To
quash an Endictment for not repairing a High way.
The Exception taken was, that the Endictment did conclude, that the party
ought to repair it by reason of his tenements, which was said to be uncertain,
and it ought to have said, that he, and all those whose estate he has in the
Tenements used to repair it. And 2ly. It should have said, that by reason of
the tenure of his Tenements he ought to repair, and not by reason of his
tenements, And upon these Exceptions it was quashed.

Trevilian and Welman.
Hill. 1653. Banc. sup.
TRevilian brought an Action upon the Case against Welman for speaking of these
words of him, Arrest of judgment for words.
viz. He did put in two Horses to Colonel Windham, meaning Colonel Windham that
was Governor of Bridgewater, and as soon as any warrants came for the pressing
of men for the service, he acquainted the Cavalliers, by reason whereof none
could be pressed that were fit, and he does hold constant correspondency with
the Cavalliers. Upon Issue joined, and a Verdict found for the Plaintiff, It was
moved in Arrest of Judgment that the words were not Actionable, because
utterly uncertain, either when Col. Windham was Colonel, and when the Horses
were put in, and the other words are as uncertain as these. But it was
answered, that if all the words be taken together, they are certain enough to
ground an Action, for if they be true the Plaintiff thereby will be expressly
made a Delinquent, and have his estate sequ^stred for adhering and assisting
the King against the Parliament, and of this opinion was the Court, and
thereupon the Plaintiff had his judgment.

Hill. 1653. Banc. sup.
IN the Case of one Page and Crook, it was said by the Court, Who may be

That it an Action of Trespass be brought against one with a simul cum with

Whitehead and Buckland.
Hill. 165^
Whitehead brought an Action of Trespass by Original against Buckland, for
taking away 400 Sheep, and 26 Bullocks, Demurrer to a replication in Trespass
et armis.
the Defendant pleads the Statute of 21 Iac. of limitations of actions in Bar,
the Plaintiff replied that he sued forth and Original writ within 6 years, and
that the process thereupon was duly continued, upon this the Defendant demurred,
and for cause shows, that the replication is not good; for when the Plaintiff
says that he sued forth an original, he ought to have added prout patet per
Recordum, which is omitted. 2ly. He has not pleaded the continuances of his
process upon the Record. Maynard answered, that the replication is good, for we
cannot take a traverse upon their plea, which is surplusage, and we need not
plead all the continuances but it is sufficient if we plead as much of the
Record as goes in Bar. Roll chief Justice, The plea is plain, and it is not
necessary to allege the continuances, for here is an appearance. At another day
Maynard said, the plea in Bar is not good, for he pleads an immaterial thing,
for it matters not when the original was sued forth, but he ought to plead not
culpable within six years before the Original sued forth. Roll chief Justice,
This is the usual way of pleading, and it is but to put you to a new
assignment, Plea.
and the plea is good, for you are not tied up by it, for you are not forced to
join issue, for you may make a new assignment; but waive the Demurrer on one
part, and the pleading of the Statute on the other part, and take a new plea
and go to a trial, otherwise we must give judgment for the Plaintiff. But the
Court would advise. Latch at another day said, that the replication is naught
for the uncertainty, for it does not appear where the Original was sued forth,
nor the time when, for it is only said he sued forth an Original in Michaelmas
Term, and part of Michaelmas Term may be within six years, and the other part
may be after the six years, and so it cannot be known whether it was sued forth
in due time or no, and because no place is showed there can be no Venue.
Adjourned to the next term, At another day the Case was moved again, and then
the 2 exceptions taken, that it was not said prout patet per Recordum, and had
not shown the continuances of the process, were over ruled by the Court; and
then another Exception was taken to the replication, that it concluded and hoc
perit quod inquiratur per patriam, which is not good, for it hinders the other
party to rejoyn, and he is compelled either to join issue, or to demur. Latch
answered, That the party may not be admitted to take advantage of this fault
now upon a general demurrer, and he is not tied up from rejoyning, although an
issue be offered him, for though the plea be informal yet he may pass over and
rejoyn, Hob. f. 80. Newman and Stones case. Notwithstanding an unnecessary
traverse the party may plead over, and is not bound to join issue, and the
impertinency of the plea shall remain but only as a blemish in form of the
plea, and shall not be accounted a fault in the substance of it. And 2ly. their
bar is not good, and therefore it matters not though the replication be not
good, for it is impertinent to set forth an Original, but he ought to have
pleaded generally that he was not guilty within 6 years before the Original
brought, but here he has impertinently set forth the time of bringing the
Original, and this answers not the Statute, and the matter alleged destroys his
own plea, and here can be no good Issue joined without departure from his plea,
to wit from his bar, and this is not to be suffered in pleading; and here is
neither certainty nor congruity in the parts of the pleading, for the beginning
of the term is uncertainly alleged. 2ly. He shows not what day of the Term he
issued forth his original, but only says generally in Michaelmas Term, which in
Cole and S^bs^ys case in this Court was lately adjudged naught. Hales on the
other side said, that the bar is good, and that the replication is
insufficient, because the Defendant is tied up by an issue, and is not suffered
to rejoyn, and it is insufficient in substance, for he has not made a proper
conclusion, for he ought to have concluded, et hoc est paratus est verificare,
and as it is it is impertinent, and the Plaintiff cannot pass over to rejoyn as
Latch supposes, and this case is not like the case of the traverse cited by
him, where he may pass over, it being but in matter of form, but it is not so
here, for the Travers avers the plea, and concludes not the party as here he is
concluded, and can do no other thing but demur or join in the Issue tendered;
And the bar also is good and sufficient, notwithstanding the time of the
Originals issuing forth be alleged, although it was in his election to have
showed the time, or not to have showed it, and his showing it makes not the
plea worse but more certain, and although it be not the truth of the Case as he
has alleged it, I doubt whether it should be a departure for the Plaintiff to
reply to a new Original assigned, and it may be there were two Originals, and
the Defendant relyes upon the last Original, and if the other Original be
pleaded he may reply to it afterward. 2ly. Admitting he cannot depart, this
will do no hurt, for the plea is not worse for him although it be better for
the other. 3ly. It is not uncertain to say that it issued forth in Michaelmas
Term, for all the Term is but one day in Law, and it is said when the Term
began, namely the 23 of October, and if it be not so certainly expressed as it
ought to be, yet by the replication this advantage is lost, and it is not like
to Cole and Sibseys case cited on the other side, for there was a special
Demurrer, but here the Demurrer is general, and there it was of the parties own
setting forth. Latch, If the Assignment of the Original be at his peril, if he
set it not forth right it is ill, and it is not well here assigned, for there
is neither time nor place alleged when it issued forth. Roll chief Justice, I
conceive the replication is not good, for the party is bound up that he cannot
rejoyn, Repl^cation.
but must either demur or join in Issue with you, and I have not heard of
passing over in the Case, as may be done in the Case of a Traverse which
concludes not the party, and here you aver not your plea as you ought, and the
other ought to be left at liberty to re join if he please, Averment.
which he cannot do here; but it is doubtful whether the Plea in Bar be good
or not, because there is no time certain alleged of issuing out the Original,
for it is said generally in Michaelmas Term, whereas an Original bears Test at
a day certain, and may issue forth out of the Term, Original. Test.
and it is not like a judicial writ, and it is questionable whether this be
matter of form only, or of substance, and me seems it is matter of substance to
be averred. The Court would advise.

At another day the Case was again put and spoken to by Wadham Windham, who,
upon putting the Case urged, that the Defendant here sets forth another
original not set forth by the Plaintiff, and this is not brought within the time
limited by the Statute; and upon this the Plaintiff rejoyns, and he cited Coals
and Sibsyes Case, and insisted, that the Defendants plea in bar is not good in
the matter of substance, for he shows no time nor place when he first sued
forth his Original, and he ought to show when he took it forth, that the Court
may judge whether it was done in due time or no, 7 H. 7. f. 150.
as the Statute requires, and not to put the Court to make enquiry when it
issued forth, and although it be but surplusage to show it, yet now having
taken upon him to show the time, he ought to show it precisely, Dyer, 365.
Lakes Case.
Hill. 10 Iac. Westby^ and Rookes Case in this Court, the mis-pleading of a
Statute is not good, though the party was not bound to plead it, and so it is
here. And the replication does us no harm: for there is no matter in it that
makes against us, for the Court ought to judge upon the whole Record, and
consider who made the first fault, and that has the Defendant done in his bar,
and that in matter of substance, and he cited Cardinal Pools Case, and Hob.
rep. Baspooles Case, and prayed judgment for the Plaintiff. Wild on the other
side said, that the bar is only vicious in form, and so it hurts not, and if
so, then the other party has lost his advantage of it by the Statute, for he
has not demurred upon us, but we have demurred upon him, to wit, upon his
replication. Roll chief Justice, I am of opinion that the setting forth of the
Original by the Defendant, and concluding that he is not guilty within six
years from that time is not good: but now that is waived by the replication,
and is made matter of form, as it is in the Case of a new assignment, and the
Common bar is now out of doors. It had been good to have shown the precise day
of taking forth the Original, but it is not absolutely necessary to do it, and
this is not like the mis-pleading of a Statute which must be precisely pleaded
and is matter of substance: but this is matter of form only, and besides this
matter is here waived, and nothing is showed by the Plaintiff which can bar him
of his Action, Demurrer.
nor has the Defendant pleaded any thing to bar him. And by the replication
you have hindered the Defendant to plead to you, for you have concluded ad
patriam, and stopped him from proceeding further in pleading: but the principal
matter is, that you have waived the matter pleaded in bar, of which you might
have taken advantage, and I conceive that he who demurs upon matter of form
ought to show the special matter wherefore he demurs: Advantage.
but if it be waived by the other by his replying, he shall not afterward take
advantage for the not showing it, notwithstanding the Statute, and diverse
opinions upon it, for the Statute enjoyneth to set forth the matter of form
pleaded insufficiently. Nil capiat per billam, nisi.

Hill. 1653. in the Upper Bench.
MAster Attorney General moved the Court after issue joined in an Endictment
preferred against Mrs. Levingston, To stay a Trial upon an Endictment.
and the Trial being to be the next day, that the Trial might be stayed by rule
of Court, because the Endictment is erroneous in many things, and the Trial
thereupon will be fruitless, for no judgment can be had upon it, and we may
prefer a new Endictment, and one fault in it is, that the Bill was found by a
Grand Jury, whereof some of them were outlawed when they found it. Wild on the
other side prayed the Trial might go on, because the Issue is joined, and the
Jury returned, and many Witnesses, viz. a hundred at least are brought to Town,
some a great way off, and are kept here at a great charge. Roll chief Justice,
Waiver. Demurrer.
The Attorney may waive the Issue if he please though it be joined or he may
demur if he will, therefore let him make what entry he thinks good upon the
Roll, Entry. Rule.
for we will make no rule in it.

Stephenson and Steward.
Hill 1654. Upper Bench.
STevenson brought an Action of Debt against Steward for rent, Exception to a
Plea of Privilege of Parliament.
the Defendant pleaded in abatement of the Writ that he was, in regard of
moneys which he had lent to the Parliament, protected by their special order
from all arrests. The Plaintiff replied, that this order was afterward repealed
by another general order of Parliament. Carew urged that the Defendants plea
was not now good, because the Parliament being dissolved, their orders are of
no force; and prayed judgment for the Plaintiff. Roll chief Justice, If the
plea was good when it was pleaded, your Action must abate, Abatement.
Peremptory.
and you must begin again: for the plea is but in abatement, and not peremptory
to the party; and therefore let the Writ abate.

Hill. 1653. Upper Bench.
By Roll chief Justice, Where may be a new Original.
If an Action of Battery by Original be against two, and one comes in upon the
Exigent, there may be a new Original brought against the other with a Simul
cum, and those who are waived may be Witnesses in the Cause, and this is usual
practice: but those who are declared against with a Simul cum cannot be
Witnesses. Witness.


Greenling and Bawdit.
Hill. 1653. Upper Bench.
GReenling brought an Action upon the Case against Bawdit, Arrest of judgment
in an Action upon an Assumpsit.
and declared, that the Defendant in consideration that the Plaintiff would
mary such a Woman, did assume and promise that upon his marriage with her, he
would pay the Plaintiff 50 l. and would also give unto him yearly one firkin of
Eggs, and a flitch of Bacon during the life of the Plaintiff; and upon a Nihil
dicit the Plaintiff obtains a Judgment, and upon a Writ of Enquiry of damages
executed, great damages were found for the Plaintiff. It was moved in arrest
of Judgment, 1. That it does not appear for what breach of promise the Action
is brought, whether for the not paying the 50 l. or not paying the Eggs and
Bacon. 2ly. It is not averred in what year the Defendant was to begin to pay
the Eggs and Bacon. Intendment.
To this R^ll chief Justice answered, that it shall be intended to begin within
the year next after the marriage shall take effect. 3ly. It was excepted
against, that it does not appear for how many years the Eggs and Bacon were
unpaid, and the promise was made anno 1647. and the Writ of Enquiry was
executed anno 1653. But Roll chief Justice overruled the Exceptions, and to
the last answered, the Record is huc usque, and so it is certain enough.
Therefore let the Plaintiff have his Judgment, nisi, etc.

Hill. 1654. Upper Bench.
IN the Case of one Banister where the Action was an Action of Debt brought
against an Executor, Roll chief Justice, said, What is an affirmative plea and
not negative.
That riens inter man's pleaded by an Executor is an affirmative plea in
substance, though it sound something in the negative, for it is in effect the
same with plene administravit, and such plea must be averred, and he put this
difference, Averment.
viz. where an Issue is joined up upon a negative plea without any replication,
it is not necessary to aver the plea, but if there be a replication it must be
averned.

Hayward and Ducket.
Hill. 1653. Banc. sup.
Pasch. 1653. rot. 196.
HAyward brought an Action upon the Case against Ducket that was Executor to
another, and declares, Arrest of Judgment in an action upon a promise.
that whereas the Testator did owe unto the Plaintiff such a sum of money, which
the Plaintiff did intend to sue the Defendant for, the Defendant did assume and
promise to the Plaintiff, that if he would forbear to sue him for the money, and
would suffer him to go into the Country, he would pay the money, and for breach
of this promise he brought his Action, and obtains a verdict. It was moved in
Arrest of Judgment, that there appears no consideration in the Declaration to
ground the promise upon, whereby to make the Defendant liable to pay the money
which he promised to pay, for it does not appear that he is Executor, and
Rosyer and Langdales case, Anno 1650. in this Court was cited. To this it was
answered by the Council on the other side, That a good consideration does
appear well enough, for when he says that he was to forbear to sue him as
Executor, it shall be intended that he was Executor at the time when he should
so forbear to sue him, and the promise is so laid. Plow. 128. Roll chief
Justice, To say that I will forbear to sue one as Executor, is not an
affirmance that he is Executor, and there was such a case as this ruled in the
Exchequer, and it is no more, nay not so much as if he had said, that he would
not sue him at all. Judgment pro Defendente, nisi.

Hill. 1653. Banc. sup.
BY Roll chief Justice, In an Action upon the case vi et armis, Where one needs

It is not necessary to conclude contra pacem publicam, but in an Action of
Trespass quare vi et armis, the conclusion must be contra pacem publicam.

Hill. 1653. Upper Bench.
BY Roll chief Justice, What Bailey must show his Warrant.
A special Bailey is bound to show his warrant to the party whom he is to
Arrest, otherwise the party to be arrested is not tied to obey him, but he is
not bound to show his warrant to a Stranger, but a known Bailey is not bound to
show his Warrant to any.

Hill. 1653. Upper Bench.
BY Roll chief Justice, What Writ of Error is good.
If an Action be brought against three, and one of them is an Infant, and they
all appear by Attorney, and an entire Judgment is given against them all, and
they all join in a writ of Error to reverse this Judgment, this writ is well
brought, for the judgment was erroneous, Judgment.
because it is an entire judgment, for as to the Infant it cannot be good, and
so it is naught to the rest, and he cited one Byres case 9 Iac. in the point.

Porter and Swetnam.
Hill. 1653. Upper Bench.
Trin. 1653. rot. 723.
A Writ of Error was brought to reverse a Judgment given upon a non sum
informatus in the Common pleas in an Action of Covenant brought upon a Lease
for years for not paying the rent reserved, Error to reverse a judgment upon a
non sum informatus in debt for rent.
and not repairing, and this was against an Executrix of the Assignee of the
Lessee for years, and it was brought as to the non-payment of the rent upon the
words yielding and paying, and not upon an express Covenant, and for that the
words yielding and paying are but a Covenant in Law, and only an employed
Covenant, and arises but from a personal Covenant, and not upon a real
contract, as Latch held, who argued for the Plaintiff in the writ of Error,
Therefore he said the Action of Covenant could not here lie against the
Execuirix, as a warranty in Law binds only the party, and not privies, as
Spencers case is, Dyer 257. 2ly. The Plaintiff in the Action does not declare
that the Defendant was made Executrix, and if she be but Executrix de son tort
demesne, she is not liable to this Action. Wadham Windham on the other side
held, that the words yielding and paying in the Lease are an express Covenant,
and the A^ion here is for rent become arrear in the time of the Executrix, and
this Covenant being a Covenant which makes the rent payable ratione terrae, it
does concern her, and an Executrix de son tort is bound to pay the rent. Roll
chief Justice, take time to answer both Exceptions, but I conceive at present,
that the words yielding and paying are an express Covenant, for if they were
not, what remedy else would there be to recover the rent? Covenant.
for if she be a disseisor, neither debt nor Covenant will lie against her. At
another day Windham argued that the Action was well brought, because this is an
express Covenant, and not a Covenant in Law. 2ly. It is not material to show
how she is made Executrix; and for the first this must be an express Covenant,
because it is by Indenture, although the word Covenant be not expressed, for
that word is not a word of Art, and so not essential to the constituting of a
Covenant, Dyer 57.27 E. 4. f. 6. And for the second it is well set forth, that
she is made Executrix, for it is said she entered as an Executrix: 2ly. She has
admitted herself to be Executrix by pleading. Latch on the other side held,
That here is only a Covenant in Law, and so is the book in Dyer cited by
Windham, and the Executrix is not bound here, because it is against the
Assignee of a Term, and the very words do show that here is no express
Covenant, for the words yielding and paying are not the words of the Lessee,
but only by construction of Law, but are the words of the Lessor enjoining the
Lessee to pay the rent. Roll chief Justice, How prove you that this Action lies
not against an Assignee? Latch The case of Overton and Sidney proves it, for it
proves that Debt lies not, and by consequence Covenant lies not. And for the
second matter, the Defendant is not entitled to the lease in privity, because
it is not showed that she is made Executrix, and so she shall be taken but as
an Executrix of her own wrong, and so is not chargeable, because she has no
privity of estate but by her entry, nor is it any where ever mentio^ed that any
can be Executrix de son tort of a Term. 2ly. She cannot be a Termor, but she
must be a Disseiseress, for she cannot apportion her own wrong. 3ly. She cannot
make a title to the Term by her entry, as it may be by a que estate, and
therefore it is against reason that she shall be a Termor, and there is no
authority against this, Pasch. 25 Eliz. in this Court. King and Burges in Mores
Reports Dyer 254. Upon a Demurrer, adjudged that it was not showed how one was
Executor. Roll chief Justice, What say you to the Objection, that the Action is
brought against you as an Executrix, and you appear and plead, and so admit
your self to be an Executrix? And I hold that here is an express Covenant, for
the words are the agreement of both parties to the Indenture, and then the
Executor is chargeable by them, and it is not like to the Case of a Demise, and
there is no difference here between a Covenant in Law, and an express Covenant,
because it is touching a thing which arises from the land, and so the Assignee
is bound by it, and this Case is not like the case cited out of Dyer, for there
the estate was determined, but here it continues. And as to the last point, I
conceive prima facie, that she shall be accounted a true Executrix; and you by
pleading have admitted it; and if one enter as an. Executor upon a Term, he may
have the Term if the other will admit him to be a Termor, and he shall not be
accounted a Disseisor to the Lessor, and to strangers he shall be accounted an
Executor in Law, if they bring Actions against him, and the Term shall be
assets in his hands; As if one receive my rent without my consent, I may charge
him as my receiver, Assets.

BRomefield brought an Action of Debt upon an Obligation to perform the
Covenants of a Lease for years against Sir John Williamson, Demurrer to a
replication in debt upon an Obligation.
the Defendant pleaded that he had performed the Covenants, the Plaintiff
replies, and sets forth a breach, and upon this the Defendant demurred, and
upon the Demurrer the Case was this: A Lease was made for one year, the Lessee
covenants for him and his Assigns to pay the rent, so long as he and they shall
have the possession of the thing let; the Lessee assigns over his Term, the
Term expires, the Assignee continues the possession after the Term expired, and
for rent behind by the Assignee after the expiration of the Term, the Lessor
brings the Action, and the question was whether here be such an Assignee that
the Action will lie against, or not, Roll chief Just. held, that though here be
not an Assignee, strictly, Assignee. Covenant.
according to the rules of Law, yet that he shall be accounted such an Assignee
as is to perform the Covenants made between the parties, and ruled the
Defendant to show cause why the Plaintiff should not have judgment. Nota.

comment'd by Original, but if it had been by Bill it would have been otherwise.
Roll chief Justice, It is the use in the Common Pleas to make such short
recitals, but in the beginning of the Record here it is recited, at large, and,
if it were not recited at large it would not be good; Recital.

IN an Action of Trepass and Ejectment a special V^rdict was found, Special
verdict in Trespass and Ejectment.
and in it this Custom, viz. That the Owners of Houses in the Town of
New Castle in fee simple may devise them by Paroll, but not Tenants in tail,
and it was further found, that the Testator was seized of the Houses in
question in fee tail in possession, and of the remainder of them in fee-simple,
and so seized did devise them by Paroll. The question was, whether this devise
was warranted by the Custom. Shafto argued, that the Custom did not warrant
this devise, because Customs are not to be enlarged by construction, but are to
be taken strictly, and according to the letter, because they run in abridgement
of the Common Law, and so are not to be favored, 9 E. 3. f. 38.11 H. 4. f.
33.5. H. 6. f. 51. Next here are immaterial words found in the Verdict, for if
it be the Custom for Tenant in fee-simple to devise, yet this extends not to
tenant in tail, 27 H. 6. f. 5.21. E. 4. f. 24. and a devise of rent to be
issuing out of these Houses is not good within the Custom, although that a rent
does follow the nature of the Land, 22 Assis. pl. 78.26 H. 8.54. It is true,
Cook in his Littleton, f. 111. says, that one may devise a rent in remainder,
but I deny this, for the authorities of the Books are against him. An estate in
remainder is not Assets, nor can be devised, 3 H. 7. f. 23, 24. a condition
goes to an Estate. tail, not to a fee-simple in remainder, 6 Rep. f. 33. And
here is but a power of an Estate, and not an Estate in possession, Lit. sect.
137. And the finding here that the Tenant in tail did die without issue is not
material, for this could not be known at the time of the devise, and the devise
takes its effect in the time of the Devisor, 27 H. 8. Dyer 45.5. Eliz. Dyer,

Burgers may devise as it ought to be. Turner John on the other side held, that
some Estate does pass by the Will, and it matters not what Estate passes, and
the Owners of Houses in our Case shall be intended to be Tenants in fee-simple,
and it is not necessary that they be Tenants in fee in possession, Perkins
devises, Plowd. 262. Dyer 22.22 Eliz, 371. p. 5. and the Custom here found is
no more, but an ordinary Custom common to other Boroughs, and it shall not be
intended a special Custom. And this case may be resembled to Cases upon the
Statute of 32, and 34 H. 8. for devising of Lands, 10 Rep. f. 81. Trin. 34
Eliz. Benefilds Case there cited and 35 Eliz. Howards Case, which prove, that
reversions may be devised, Not. brev. 199. a. Perkins Devises, Pl. 540. is the
very Case in question, and the Cases put on the other side come not to our
Case. Roll chief Justice, It is not necessary in a special Verdict to be so
precise as in pleading, Special verdict.
but something may be supplied, and the verdict has found that he was Owner,
and that the Owner may devise, and the Custom is, that every Owner in
fee-simple may devise, and the Custom shall go to Land, and holds to reversions
as well as to lands in possession. At another day it was argued, that the
devise was not good, for the word Owners cannot extend to all sorts of Owners,
for it extends not to an Infant Owner of such Houses, for he cannot devise,
therefore the words must receive a limited construction, and therefore I
conceive the word Owner extends only to an absolute Tenant in fee-simple, and
not to a reversioner in fee: for a Custom must, as has been said, be taken
strictly, 12 E. 4. f. 3.21 E. 4. f. 24. 2ly. In true construction this Owner in
fee in remainder shall not be said Owner, but the Tenant in tail is Owner, and
so here is not Owner ex vi termini. 3ly. Here is but a possibility of
fee-simple in him, which is not grantable or devisable, 2 Ed. 4.1. and the
Statute of Westminster. 2d. helps not to the Custom: for that Statute is within
memory of man, 26 H. 8. f. 4.22 Ass. Pl. 78. And upon the very finding of the
verdict it cannot be good, for by the Verdict no title is found for the
Defendant. Latch on the other side held, that here is a good devise warranted
by the Custom, for here is an Estate within the very letter of the Custom, for
he is true Owner of the House in fee-simple, although it be not in present
possession, for he has fee-simple in it, and has it to his own benefit in
such an Estate as it is, and the word Owner is a general word, and
comprehends all manner of Ownerships. 2ly. It is within the reason of the
Custom, for it intends the same benefit to Owners in reversion as it does to
Owners in possession, and is indifferent unto all Estates. And although a
Custom shall be taken strictly, yet it shall also be taken reasonably, as
having respect to the benefit of the party, and there can be no reason alleged
to be against this devise; 26 H. 8.4. A remainder in fee shall go according to
the Custom, whether by the Custom Lands in fee shall go, the Custom shall go to
all things issuing out of the Land, and so to all Estates in the Land, Dyer
148. and here is more than a possibility devised, 4 and 5 Phil. and Mar.
Benloes. It is ruled, that a fee-simple expectant shall go to the youngest Son
by the Custom, where the Custom was, that the youngest Son should have the
Lands of which his Ancestor dyed seized; and as to the Verdict here is a good
title found for the Defendant. Roll chief Justice, The verdict is imperfect,
for the Ejectment is against Baron and Feme, and the Feme is found Ejector by
the verdict, and nothing is found concerning the Baron, Venire de novo.
therefore you must have a Venire de novo, if you will not agree to amend the
Verdict according to the notes, if the notes will warrant it. Afterward a
Venire de novo was awarded by consent.

IN an Action of Account the Defendant pleads ne unques receptor, Plea before
Auditors.
upon this an Issue was joined, and an imperfect verdict found, and thereupon a
Venire de novo was awarded, and the Jury found for the Plaintiff, and the
Defendant adjudged to account before Auditors. The Defendant pleads before the
Anditors, that he had delivered over part of the moneys. To this the Plaintiff
demurs, and shows for canse that this Plea is contrary to the Verdict, for that
is, that he should account for all, and here he would account but for part
only. Windham for the Plaintiff argued, that this cannot be a good plea before
Auditors in discharge of the account, but it goes in bar of the account, Dyer
196. 41 E. 3. f. 31.22 H. 6.25. and in Boynton and Cheeks Case lately in this
Court such a Plea was adjudged not good. And it would be michievous if it
should be otherwise, in reserving such matter to be tried again. Twisden on the
other side said it is a good plea before Auditors, to say, that he received the
moneys to deliver over, and there are four opinions in the Books how this
matter should be pleaded, ^o E. 3. Br. Acc. 8^. hold ^ that this Plea is
pleadable before Auditors, and this plea is in discharge of the Account, and
therefore pleadable before Auditors, 12 H. 4.18. and in Baynton and Cheeks Case
cited, the judgment was not given upon this point. Roll thief Justice, The
Books generally are, that this plea is in bar of the Account: Plea. Bar.
but here your plea of delivery over, has made it a plea in bar, and it would
be mischievous to plead it now, for this would cause one and the same issue to
be twice tried, and then there may be contrary Verdicts, which would be
inconvenient. Therefore let judgment be for the Plaintiff.

in an action for not setting forth of T^hs.
It was moved in arrest of judgment that the Statute was mis-recited, because
it was not said the Parliament in which it was made was held by prorogation, as
in truth it was. But Latch answered, that it is not mis-recited, for it is true
that the Parliament was held, upon the 9th. of November, Recital.
as we have alleged, though we have not expressed it to be held by prorogation,
and we conceive it is not necessary to express it to be so held, for the

AN Action upon the Case was brought upon two promises, Arrest of judgment in
an, Action upon two promises.
viz. to pay so much money upon a certain day: and 2ly. to save the Plaintiff
harmless, etc. Upon issue joined and a verdict found for the Plaintiff, it was
moved in arrest of judgment, that the Plaintiff did not show how the Defendant
has not saved the Plaintiff harmless, but only says generally that he did not
save him harmless, and so he may bring another Action for the same thing. The
Court was then of opinion that it was not good to say generally, that the
Defendant did not save him harmless, but he ought to show in what particular;
as if I assume and promise to one to give him all the money in my Purse, I must
show how much money was in it, and aver that I gave it him. At another day
Sergeant Clark moved for judgment, whom Latch seconded, and said, here is a
good breach assigned: for it is that he paid not the money for which the
Plaintiff was bound with him at such a day, according to his promise. Twisden
on the other side said, that the consideration is to pay the usury for the money
for which the Plaintiff was bound with the Defendant, which is not a good
consideration, for it is against the Common Law to let money for usury, and so
it was adjudged 2 Car. and the Statutes do but tolerate the taking of usury
for moneys. 2ly. Here is no time of the consideration set forth. Latch, The
usury here is no more than the Statute allows, and so it is a good
consideration. Alleyn, The promise declared upon is double, 1. to pay money.
2ly. To save harmless, and the breach is assigned generally, Case.
and not particularly as it ought to be. Roll chief Justice, If two breaches be
assigned, and the one well assigned, and the other not, yet the Action lies
well enough: but here is but one breach assigned, viz. the non-payment of the
money at the day. And for the other matter I hold it a good consideration to
assume to save one harmless from paying of Usury, Consideration
and the usury here expressed is lawful by the Statute, and so it has been
resolved since 2 Car. and therefore let judgment be for he Plaintiff, nisi.

Mich. 1653. rot. 429.
HIggs brings an Action of Trespass quare clausum fregit against Harrison an
Attorney of the Common Pleas. Demurrer to a plea of privilege by an Attorney.
The Defendant pleads his privilege by an Attorney, and to this plea the
Plaintiff demurred; the question was whether he may plead this plea by Attorney,
or ought to plead it in proper person. Latch argued. That he ought not to plead
it by Attorney, for this plea is not a plea to the jurisdiction of the Court,
but it is only a prayer to the Court, and he might have done it ore tenus, and
pleading it by Attorney his plea cannot be entered, for then the plea of
privilege would be destroyed in making him to attend. Every one by the Common
Law ought to appear in person, and there is no Statute, Law nor usage that
authoriseth an Attorney to make an Attorney to demand his privilege. 2ly. It is
against the dignity of this Court that he should be admitted to do it. 3ly. By
making of an Attorney he destroys the very reason why he claims his privilege,
which is to be spared of his attendance, which he needs not if he make an
Attorney, and his making of an Attorney here is a general warrant to defend
other causes as well as this, and the Case of an Essoign objected makes for me,
which is but to pray an excuse, and after an Attorney made one cannot cast an
essoign, except it be where the Attorney cannot answer, 4 Ed. 3.34. And there
is no authority can be showed that he may make an Attorney. But on the contrary
part there are many presidents where Attorneys have prayed their privilege in
person, and these me seems should make the Law in this Case, Dyer 33 H. 8. is
the express case, Attorney.
20 H. 6.32. The Court advised. At another day Roll chief Justice said, That
the opinion of the Court was, that an Attorney may plead his privilege by an
Attorney, and there is no inconvenience follows by doing it; but it is true the
Presidents are both ways, and it is not contrary to any thing he has done, and
it may be he is sick, or has business in another Court, where he is
necessarily attend. Therefore let his plea be allowed, nisi.

The Protector and Captain Streeter.
Hill. 1653. Banc. sup.
CAptain Streeter was brought in Court by habeas Corpus, For delivery of a
Prisoner appearing upon a Habeas Corpus.
and upon the return read and filed, it appears that he was committed by an
Order of Parliament, for publishing scandalous and sedilious books. Twisden
moved that the prisoner might be bailed, because that the Parliament is now
dissolved, and by consequence the Order by which he was committed, is of no
sorce. Mr. Attorney General on the other side urged, that the Parliament was
not dissolved, but only the meeting of those persons in Parliament was
dissolved, for the Parliament by the ancient Law is to be every year, so that
this is but in effect an adjournment, and not a dissolution, and besides, this
matter for which the prisoner stands committed cannot be here inquired of, and
so the cause of his commitment shall be intended to be good, and the Parliament
may commit without showing the cause of the commitment, and this commitment may
be in order to his Trial, and the Prisoner is not without remedy, for he may
apply himself to the supreme Authority, to whom the Parliament have resigned
their power. Twisden for the prisoner confessed, that this Court cannot be
Judge of the Parliament; but this Order by which he is committed differs from
an Act of Parliament, for this is temporary, and determines; and although the
authority of Parliament cease not, yet a particular Parliament may be
dissolved, as this was. Wad. Windham, When a Parliament is dissolved, the
proceedings there are determined. Flowrdews case 1 H. 7. the Latin case, and
the Parliament is now dissolved, and not adjourned, and a Parliament dissolved
is not like the Courts of Justice here in the Vacation time. Wild, This case is
not like to the case where this Court remaunded a prisoner committed by the
Parliament sitting the Parliament, for the prisoner here is coram Protectore
who may deliver him. Captain Streeter, Mr. Attorney labors to afperse me, but
shows no cause or crime for my commitment, and I am here before the Protector
in his own Court. Attorney General, Only the persons and their convention is
dissolved, but not the Court, no more than this Court is, by the demise of the
King, or in the Vacation time, and I must refer it to the Court how far you
will intermeddle in this case, and this Order by which he stands committed may
be his judgment there, and then he cannot be delivered; and I know no
difference between an Order and an Ordinance of Parliament, and the stamp and
authority of Parliament is upon this order; and if the prisoners Counsel say
true, then he may have an Action of false imprisonment against his Jailer.
Twisden, Here is no Order of the Parliament returned, but it expresses that he
was committed by the Speaker by virtue of an Order of the Parliament. Roll
chief Justice, We examine not the Orders of Parliament; but the question is
whether the Order does now continue, Order of Parliament, Dissolution.
and I conceive it is determined by the dissolution of the Parliament, and so
would it have done by prorogation of the parliament, because there is another
Session, and we can judge no otherwise of Orders of Parliament, but by the
words of them. Ask Justice, If one that is committed by Order of Parliament
cannot be delivered until another Parliament, the peoples liverty will be lost,
for there may not be a Parliament in many years. Roll chief Justice, A new
Parliament has not reference to the old, but it is a new Court created upon
new Summons, and why may not the Prisoner be bailed without these disputes?
although he may apply himself elsewhere; But the Court would advise, because
they perceived the prisoner stubborn. At another day, Mr. Attorney, upon the
prisoners appearance again upon his Habeas Corpus said, that he had no more to
say than what he had formerly offered, only he added that it was a tender and a
leading case, and therefore to be well advised of. Roll chief Justice, For the
first part of the return, Return.
I conceive it too general, for it does not appear in what the books are
scandalous, for the publishing whereof he was committed. 2ly. I conceive that
the Order of Parliament cease with the Parliament, Order.
which is dissolved, as an Order of one Session of Parliament ends with the
Session, Committee.
and is not like an Act, which continues after the Parliament; and all
Committees made by order of Parliament do cease by dissolving of the
Parliament, but those which are made by Act of Parliament do continue
afterward; and this individual Parliament being dissolved, they can now make
no further order, Bail.
and so the prisoner may lie perpetually in prison, and he has already lain
long in prison, and therefore it is reason he should he bailed. The prisoner
was admonished to be quiet, and not henceforth to disturb the State. The
prisoner was ordered to bring sureties to be bound in 500 l. for his appearance
here the next Term, and sic de die in diem until Mr. Attorney will proceed
against him, if he will proceed at all.

made up betwixt them at such a time, the Defendant did assume and promise to
the Plaintiff to pay unto him a certain sum of money when the Defendant shall
set up an Apothecaries shop in Peterborough, if the Plaintiff be then living

Declaration to ground the promise upon: for the consideration is the receipt of
five pounds, which was his own money, for it was due to him upon the account,
and this can be no good consideration. But Roll chief Justice answered to this,
that a little consideration will serve to ground a promise upon, Consideration
and it may be the Plaintiff would not have acknowledged so much as 5 l. to
have been due upon the Account, if the Defendant would not have made this
promise. A second exception was taken that the Plaintiff does not aver,

The Errors assigned were, 1. That he does not show particularly how he has

there was due unto him such a sum of money. 2ly. The Promise is, that the
Defendant would pay him the fees so long as he should continue to be his

be his Attorney, and to prosecute for him during the suit, and to make the first
exception good Took and Sir Tho. Walsinghams Case lately adjudged was urged.
But as to that exception Roll chief Justice answered, it is not necessary to
show particularly how the money became due, and was expended, for this would
make the Declaration too long; and though the Plaintiff; as has been objected,
should bring another Action for the same thing, yet you may plead this recovery
in bar generally against him. Plea in bat. Intendment.

held by prorogation, because it is not necessary it should be so expressed.
2ly. The Action is here brought upon the second branch of the Statute, which
is, that all persons shall set forth their tithes, and the word subject is only
mentioned in the first clause. Maynard on the same side said, that this
mis-recital, if it be a mis-recital, affirms the Statute, and it is not a false
recital, and therefore it does not hurt. Roll chief Justice, It is not good to
make such recitals of Statutes in a Declaration, Recitals.
nor would I have any recital made hereafter more than is necessary for the
gist of the Action. Shaftoe insisted upon it, That the mis-recital here is a
material Exception, for the recital is not true; for it is not all one to say
the Subject of the King, and to say the Subject of the then King, for the
former words go to the pollitick capacity of the King as King, and the latter
words go to the natural capacity of his particular person. Roll chief Justice,
But what say you to that which is said on the other side. That the Action is
brought upon the second clause of the Statute, which is, that all persons shall
set forth their tithes, and not upon the first Clause, which speaks of all
Subjects of the King: And the recital here is not material to the Action. It is

IN a special Verdict in an Ejectione firmae, it was found, Special verdict in
an Ejectione firmae.
that there was a custom within the Manor of Castle Dunnington, that any
Copyholder of that Manor may make a writing in the nature of a Letter of
Attorney to two Copyholders of the same Manor, to surrender his Copyhold after
his death. The question was, whether this was a good custom or not. Alleyn
argued for the custom, that it was a good custom; because such customs are not
to be governed by the rules of the Common Law, but by the rules of natural
reason, and are considerable in themselves, and such customs may restrain the
Common Law, and the Common Law does tolerate them. And this custom that gives
power to make this surrender after the Copyholders death, is not unreasonable,
for the power given is not countermanded by his death, no more than an Attorney
is restrained by his masters death to act in the cause. And in Butler and
Ba^ers case, by the delivery of a deed after the death of the party, the estate
may pass by Attorney, and so although here be but a bare power given, yet it is
well executed, notwithstanding his death that gave it. 2ly. This Letter of
Attorney was not countermandable by the Copyholder himself during his life, and
therefore it shall not be countermanded by his death, and though it had been
countermandable during his life, yet it being not countermanded by him in his
life, his death shall not countermand it, and the custom does strengthen this
power. Next, this custom is not contradictory, for here is no Attorney made,
but a writing made in the nature of a Letter of Attorney, and a power to
surrender given by it, and it is no more than for one Copyholder to surrender
for another, which is usual, and in Cooks 9 Rep. f. 76. A Copyholder is called
an Attorney; also Copyhold estates are made by customs, and therefore such
customs which are to confirm estates are to be favored in Law, although they
do differ from conveyances of estates at the Common Law, and this custom is not
only reasonable, but convenient also for the passing of Copyhold estates. And
this custom enlarges the power of alienations, and such customs have generally
been admitted good, though different from the Common Law; And when a custom is
become a Law it is very dangerous to alter it, and the doing of it would
overthrow many estates. Ellis Solicitor General on the other side argued, That
the custom is not good, because it is against the rule of Law, That an
authority given should survive the party that gave it, and a custom cannot
strengthen it, for a custom ought to be reasonable, and agreeing to the nature
of the thing which it concerns, otherwise it cannot be good, for Ratio est
formalis causa consuetudinis, Dalisons Rep. 32. 1 Instit. f. 59. And this cause
cannot be reasonable, because it cannot give an authority to another to do such
a thing for him after his death, which he could not do during his life; And
this custom does purely destroy the nature of the Common Law, and therefore
cannot be good; And it is against the very nature of an authority to survive,
and so consequently it is against the nature of the thing, Dyer 357. 10 E. 3.
f. 5. 18 Rep. Vnyers case. The party in his life time might have revoked this
authority, and therefore his death does revoke it; and by the death of the
Copyholder the Copyhold is descended, and cannot be surrendered by a dead man,
and here was no incoation of the estate of the party that is dead, and I hold
there is a difference betwixt a will and an authority; And also here the Letter
of Attorney is not pursuant to the custom, and therefore it is a void Letter of
Attorney, 16 Iac. rot. 530. Greenwood and Onslaes case. Customs are to be taken
strictly, Copyhold.
and to be so pursued, and it is not so here, for here is an addition to the
custom, and this makes all void. Roll chief Justice, Copyholds are much led by
the customs of the Manor, and, me thinks, here is little difference betwixtt
surrendering into the hands of another Copyholder, to make a surrender for him,
and this case, and the variances are not so considerable as to make it void
here. The Court would advise. At another day the case was again put, Custom
and the Court delivered their opinion, that the custom was good; and Roll
chief Justice said, that the death of the party does not revoke this writing
made in the nature of a Letter of Attorney, Revocation.
for it is strengthened by the custom, and it is not like an ordinary Letter of
Attorney which becoms void by the death of him that made it, Authority.
Executor.
for this custom is a Law, and the authority here survives, as an Executor may
sell the Testators lands, it he be empowered to do it by the will, and
therefore the Custom is good, and let the Plaintiff have judgment, nisi, etc.

Thou art a common Bastard-bearing Whore, and had two Bastards by a Butcher,

Plaintiff, Twisden moved in Arrest of Judgment that the first words, viz. Thou
art a common Bastard-bearing Whore are not actionable; because they are
adjective words, and are not positive; And for the other words they are not
actionable, because they were spoken of a Feme Covert, who cannot have a
Bastard. Upon this the judgment was arrested till the next Term, and then Wild
moved for judgment, for that he conceived that the words taken together are
actionable, and cited Owen and levons case adjudged in this Court to prove it.
Roll chief Justice, If she were married at the time of the words spoken she
could not have a Bastard; but yet why should not the words be actionable, for

words spoken of a Millener in London, Action upon the case for words.
viz. Thou art in a breaking and decayed condition, and I will prove it, and if
you question me, I will prove it to your disgrace. Twisden moved for judgment
for the Plaintiff, because he held the words are actionable; for by the speaking
of them the Plaintiff is disgraced in his profession; for in common
understanding the words amount to as much as if he had said that the party is a
Bankrupt, and it is so averred in the Record, and found by the Jury, and he
cited Mich. 1651 Tailor and Keisers case, and Smith and Rookes case 24 Car.
Wild on the other side said, that the words are not actionable, Adjective words.
for they are adjective words, and of an uncertain signification, for the words
may as well mean that he is broke or burst in his body, as that he is a
Bankrupt or broken in his estate; and there is no averment that the words were
spoken in the hearing of tradesmen, and though they were, yet they may not tend
to his disgrace, for a Tradesman may be in a decaying condition, in respect of
what he has formerly been, and yet have stock enough left to trade withal.
The Court then inclined that the words were actionable, but for that time gave
no judgment; Judgment.

AN Action upon the Case was brought by Lawrence against Harison his Attorney
for delivering a Fieri facias against him, Action upon the Case for breach of

in the suit wherein he was Attorney for him, to the Undersheriff, and
procuring it to be executed against him, contrary to the trust reposed in him.
Upon not-guilty pleaded, and a verdict sound for the Plaintiff, It was moved in
arrest of judgment for the Defendant by Windham, That there appears not in the
Record to be any combination between the Defendant and the Plaintiffs adversary
against his Clyent, and so no breach of trust appears to ground the Action
upon. 2ly. Here being a judgment in the Case, the suit in which he was
entertained to be Attorney is ended, and consequently the trust reposed in him
is determined, and so no breach of it, for he is now discharged from being
Attorney, and the Plaintiffs averring the contrary does not alter the Law, and
besides, this delivery of the Fieri facias is in pursuance of Justice, which
since that the suit is ended cannot be called a breach of trust. Roll chief
Justice, But you did not only deliver the Writ against your Clyent to the
Undersheriff: but did also procure it to be executed against him, which shows
there was a combination against him. The only question is, Whether a Warrant of
Attorney determined.
whether the Warrant of Attorney be determined by the judgment given in the
suit wherein he was retained; and I conceive it is not, for the suit is not
determined, for the Attorney after the judgment is to be called to say why
there should not execution be made out against his Clyent, and he is trusted to
defend his Clyent as far as he can from the execution. Therefore let the
Plaintiff have his judgment, Judgment.

You are a Beggar, and a Banckruptly Fellow, and if every one had his own, you

they are not spoken of a Merchant, or of one that gets his living by buying and

Particular damage.
Though it appear not that the Plaintiff is a Tradesman, yet here appears to be
a particular damage to him by the speaking of the words, viz. that by reason
of the speaking of them he was discredited with his Landlord, and his Landlord
had given him warning to be gone out of his Farm, and it matters not though the
words generally considered are not actionable. Therefore show cause Saturday

continuance at the time of the recovery, yet it may be ended at the time of the
Plaintiffs entry into the Land. 2ly. It is not expressed when the entry was,

whether he ought not to have brought an Action of Trespass, and not an Action

He may bring an Action upon the Case, or an Action of Trespass at his own

for by it there appears to be good cause of Action, for the time of the entry
is expressed, viz. that it was after the recovery. 2ly. The entry is found to

show, that he was dampnified by the Cattle that were distreyned
dammage-feasant, and it may be there was common enough for him notwithstanding
the other Cattle distreyned were there, What distress lawful without averment
of damages.
and so he was not dampnified by their being there. Roll chief Justice
answered, if one who has no right to Common do put his Cattle upon the Common,
he who is a Commoner may take the Cattle dammage-feasant upon the Common, and
it is not necessary for him to aver, that he has damage by them, for he has
an interest which does authorize him to remove the nuisance, Interest.
but he must make a Title to the Common, and if he have made it here but by
implication, it is well enough: for it is now helped by the verdict, Title by
implication.
and you have passed over your advantage by not demurring to him.

PRatt brought an Action upon the Case against Banks upon an Aumpsit, Error in
an action of the Case by an Attorney so fees and soliciting.
to pay him such fees as should be due unto him as his Attorney in prosecuting
a suit for him in the Common Pleas, and such moneys as he should lay out in
soliciting a suit for him in the Chancery, and upon non-assumpsit pleaded, a
Verdict was given for the Plaintiff, and a judgment thereupon. The Defendant
brought a Writ of error in this Court, and assigns for error, that the
Plaintiff did not show particularly what sums of money he had laid out for him,
nor to whom he had paid it, as he ought to do, and Took and Sir Thomas
Walsinghams case in this Court was cited to prove it. 2ly. The Assumpsit was
that he should pay him his fees, so long as he should continue to be his
Attorney, and it appears not that he continued to be his Attorney in the suit
wherein he supposes he prosecuted for him. But for the first exception Roll
chief Justice said, A general Declaration good.
that it is not necessary to set down particularly, the several sums of money he
had laid out, for this might make the Declaration tedious, and if the Plaintiff
should (as it is objected he may) bring another Action for some part of the
moneys recovered in this suit, you may plead this recovery generally in bar of
such Action. And as to the 2d. exception it shall be intended, that he did
continue to be his Attorney if it appears, as it does, Intention.
that he prosecuted for him. The case was moved again the next Term, and the
former exceptions only insisted upon. Judgment affirmed.
But Roll chief Justice overruled the exceptions, and affirmed the Judgment.

Wise a Corn-Merchant and a Baker in London brought an Action upupon the Case
against Ieffryes for speaking these words of him, Action for words brought by a
Corn-Merchant. Adjective words.
viz. Thou art a broken fellow, and have cheated me of 200 l. Upon a verdict
for the Plaintiff it was moved in arrest of judgment, that the words are not
actionable, because the words are adjectively spoken, and are not positive
words, nor of a certain signification, for they may be meant that he was broken
in his body, and not in his estate. But VVild answered, that 1. The words are
spoken of a Tradesman, which may be a Bankrupt; and 2ly. Here is an averment
that the words were meant to signify that the Plaintiff was a Bankrupt, and
besides here is a verdict for the Plaintiff. Green replied, that it does not
appear that the words were spoken of him in relation to his Trade or
Profession, and to say, that thou have cheated me, were adjudged not actionable
in Hills case, 2 Car. and in one Iohnsons case. Roll chief Justice, I do not
agree the Case of 2 Car. cited, but to the Case in question, take all the words
together as they are laid they imply he is broken in his Trade, and the word
cheated enforces this sense, and the words are very scandalous, and the
averment, Judgment.

which was said is not good in an Action of Trespass. 2. That the Plaintiff did
not set forth what the writings were which were taken away; but the first
exception was only relied upon, and to that Roll chief Justice, answered, That
if the Action were an Action of Trespass upon the case, though it were with a

Action of Trespass vi et armis, Therefore show cause why the Judgment shall
not be reversed.

being assigned, he pleads before them in discharge of the Account that he
received the money of the Plaintiff to deliver over, and accordingly he had
delivered it over; The question was whether this plea pleaded before the
Auditors was a good plea in discharge of the Account. Twisden said. It was not
a good plea in discharge of the Account before the Auditors, but it had been a
good plea in bar of the Action, and here it is not showed that there was any
direction given to pay the money over. Roll chief Justice, If he plead that it
was paid by his consent it is a good plea before the Auditors, and this is a
good plea in bar if the money be paid accordingly, Therefore take your
judgment, Judgment.

being by profession a Tailor, upon an information of extortion exhibited
against him at Oxford, at the Assizes there, for taking more money of one that
bound himself Apprentice with him, than by Law he ought; and the Error assigned
was, that the Justices of Assize have no power to determine offenses of this
nature, and Metcalfs case 11 Rep. was urged, and the Statute of 22 H. 8. C. 5.
and 28 H. 8. C. 5. But Crook Seignior answered, That as they are Justices of
Oyer and Terminer they have power by their Commission to determine offenses of
this nature, and it shall be intended they proceeded here by virtue of that
Commission, and in 7 Eliz. in Dyer it is a quaere whether the Statute be meant
of the Courts at Westminster, Certainty is required.
or no, and it would be inconvenient if the Justices should not enquire of such
offenses at the Assizes, and he cited Gregory's case, and Cooks Jurisdictions
of Courts, to prove they have authority Roll chief Justice, But it appears not
here by virtue of which of their Commissions you have tried the offense; but
you have jumbled the Commissions together in the Record, and they have not
authority by all their Commissions; and besides there is another fault in the
judgment, for it is not said it is considered by the Court, but only it is
considered. By the Statute of 22 H. 8. the Justices of Assize by virtue of
their Commission of Oyer and Terminer, have power to try diverse offenses, if
they be not restrained to certain Courts; but for the reasons aforesaid, Show
cause why the Judgment should not be reversed.

here was no confession and avoidance, or traverse of the plea in bar. Roll
chief Justice, Have you showed that he continued in possession until the rent

Upon a special Verdict the Case was this, Special verdict upon a Devise.
A man devises his lands to his wife for her life, the remaindar to A. B. and
C. and their heirs respectively for ever. The question was whether A. B. and C.
were joint tenants, or tenants in common. Sergeant Twisden held, that they were
joint renants, Whether joint tenancy or a tenancy in common.
and that this case differs from Radcliffs case, and cited Wilds case in the 6
Rep. that a Will must be clear and conspicuous, but so it is not here, and here
is no enforcement by these words respectively, and they do relate to the
persons, and not to the lands bequeathed, and a Covenant made by three
respectively is a joint Covenant, and not a several Covenant, and the word
respectively has relation to the survivorship which may happen betwixt the
parties, and a devise to one and his heir is a fee-simple. Latch, For the
Defendant held, that here is a tenancy in Common, and not a joint tenancy, for
the Estate ought to be whole out, either a tenancy in Common, or whole out, a
joint tenancy, and this of necessity; for there cannot be a joint tenancy for
life, and several inheritantes in the remainder, and Littletons ground proves
this to be so. And 2ly. It is against all construction to be otherwise, as the
word respectively is here placed, and Ratclifs case, which is not so strong a
case as this case proves it to be so, and although the word respectively may
sometimes make a distribution of heirship; as has been objected, viz. of
several heirships; yet here the placing of the word respectively shows it
cannot be so, Distribution of heirship.
and this using of the word is not operative, but idle, if here should be a
joint tenancy, for the law says as much, though the word respectively were left
out, and the word would be the more idle in explicating a thing so obvious to
common understanding, and no ways doubtful, and therefore we cannot think but
that these extraordinary words do enforce an extraordinary construction, and
not a common one, and an idle application; and this comes not within the rule
objected for the certainty for this word has a proper meaning to make a
several distribution, Operative words.
which makes it certain enough, and the word is used here absolutely, and shall
be so taken in 3 Car. Jacques and Thorowgoods case in the Common pleas, the word
equally was taken operatively, and not in common construction, and in Lewin and
Dods case in the Common pleas, 36 and 37 Eliz. the word equally was held by two
Judges to make a joynt-tenancy, and not a tenancy in common; and in this Court
also the Judges were divided at the first; but afterward Popham changed his
opinion, and it was adjudged a tenancy in common, and afterward a writ of
Error was brought in the Exchequer Chamber, and there the judgment was
affirmed, Pasch. 41 Eliz. B. r. rot. 270. Also the subject matter here is apt
to receive a tenancy in common, here being intended a provision for children,
and their several posterities, which a survivorship would destroy, 37 H. 8.
Bro. Devise 29. and the very intent of the Devisor appears in the will to be as
I have argued. Roll chief Justice, I hold here is a tenancy in common, and that
it shall go throughout, Words not to be construed to make them idle.
and is not to be divided, and the intent of the devisor appears in the will
that every one shall have his part, and their heirs, for here is a provision
made for Children, and the word respectively would be idle, if another
construction should be made, Judgment for the Plaintiff.

words were spoken upon conference betwixt the parties, and thereby does appear
a sufficient averment, that the words were spoken of the Plaintiff. Roll chief
Justice, The Declaration implies that the words were spoken falso et malitiose,
Employed averment good. Judgment.

The Defendant pleads no Award made. The Plaintiff replies and sets forth the
Award, which was, that the Defendant should pay unto the Plaintiff 100 l. at two
several days of payment, and assigns the breach in not paying the 100 l.
accordingly. To this replication the Defendant demurs, and the exception taken
was, that it does not appear in the Award, that the Award is reciprocal: but
that is only made on one part. It is true by the allegation in the pleading it
does appear: but this helps it not, for it ought to appear in the Award it
self. Award de and super praemissis. Breach not well assigned
Roll chief Justice, the Award appears to be made de and super praemissis, and
that may help it. But the Plaintiff has not well assigned the breach, for the
breach is not assigned upon a good part of the Award, for there is no cause set
forth in the Award why the Defendant should pay the 100 l. Therefore nil capiat

Henly and Baynton.
Trin. 1654. Banc. sup.
Trin. 1654. rot. 1384.
HEnly brought an Action upon the Case against Sir Edward Baynton, Arrest of
judgment in an Action up- the Case for words.
for speaking of these words of him, viz. You have cousened the State of 20000
l. and I will prove it, for you have received five and twenty thousand pounds
profits of the Office, and not compounded for it, and have foisted in words
into the order for your composition. After a verdict found for the Plaintiff, it
was moved in arrest of Judgment, that the words as they are laid in the
Declaration are not actionable: for the Plaintiff does not entitle himself to
the Office, but only to eleven parts of the profits of the Office, and so he
cannot be scandalized by the words as an Officer, and Hob. 267, 268. Sir Miles
Fleetswoods case was cited, and Hob. 76. Bray and Humes case, and 4 Iac. Cars
and Rans case, and Hill. 14 Iac. Snails case, and 20 Iac. Curle and Tucks case.
2ly. Here is no averment that Whitwick during whose life he claims the office
was alive when the words were spoken, and if he were dead then he was no
officer. And the subsequent words do qualify the former part of the words, for
the receiving of the money is not an offense or cosening of the State, 14 Iac.
Godard and Gilberts case in the Commonpleas, and for the word foisting it is an
insensible word, Insensible word.
and therefore cannot be actionable, and the Plaintiff does not aver, that he
did not foist in words into this order, No Action where no damages.
but only says, he did not foist in words into any order. And though the words
were actionable, yet at the time when the Action was brought Henly was pardoned
by the Act of Oblivion if he had done it, and so could not be damnified by the
Defendants speaking the words if they were true, and so no Action lies, for no
damages could be recovered, Hob. 82.294. Chuddington and VVilkins case, 1 E.
3.3.12 Eliz. Bartons case, 20 Ass. Pl. 7.6 Rep. 13.16 Iac. Serles case. Shafto
on the same side urged, that it appears not by the Declaration that Henly was
an Officer, or that Sir Edward Bay^ton knew him to be so, and so here is an ill
inducement, and Sir Miles Fleetwoods case is, that he ought to know that he was
an Officer, and there the words were positive and certain, but so they are not
here, nor do relate to his Office and the words are to be construed as they lie
together, and so some of them are of a very ambiguous construction and
uncertain, and others of them are insensible, and an averment cannot make
senseless words to be sense. And in the case of Curle and Tuck, 20 Iac. no
judgment was ever given, and yet that was stronger than our case. It was also
urged by Powis on the same side, that it appears not that the money spoken of
did belong to the State, or was to be compounded for, for it may be he received
the moneys before he was a Delinquent, and then he was not to compound for
them, Hob. 3.23. Bradshaw and Walkers case cited. Sergeant Twisden for the
Plaintiff held the words to be actionable, and cited 8 Car. Culme and Denhams
case, where it was adjudged, that to say a man was a cosening Knave are
actionable words, and 16 Iac. Sir William Brunkers case, and Hill. 1651 Strode
and Homes case in this Court, and Trin. 1653. Townesend and Barkers case; and
in this Case is an instancing wherein the Plaintiff has cosened which makes it
more plain, and it is also aggravated by saying he had cosened, the State, for
he has thereby incensed the State against the Plaintiff; and the words in
themselves are scandalous and prejudicial also, for if he has not compounded
he is no Officer, but has lost his Office, being liable to be sequestered, and
the words here, shall be taken in sensu composito, and not in sensu diviso,
Sensus compositus et sensus divisus.
for they are positive words, 8 Car. Redwood and Smiths case, and the last
words are only spoken to instance the Cause of speaking of the former, and it
is not material whether they be actionable or not, but the meaning of the word
foisting is not so doubtful, but is very well known, and shall be intended
that he had falsely put in words into the order, and so they are scandalous as
well as the former, 5 Car. Alleyns Case. And there is no necessity here to aver
the life of VVhitwick as is objected on the other side, for the Office was for
the life of Henly and VVhitwick, and the surviver of them, and if the averment
were necessary in some Cases, yet here it is not, because Whitwick is an
Officer upon Record in this Court, where the Action is brought, and seen to be
alive here in Court; and besides, the Statute of 21 Iac. would help this if
need required, it being after a verdict, and not upon a demurrer; and besides,
here is an averment, that he has not foisted words into this order in effect,
for he has averred, that he has not foisted words into any order, and so
consequently not into this, 2 R. 3. f. 7. 12 H. 7. f. 23. And the Act of
oblivion has not pardoned this offense, as is also objected, and though it
should, yet it must be pleaded, that the party may appear not to be excepted
ont of it, as many are, and the Jury have here found for the Plaintiff, and so
it shall be intended that he is out of the Act, and he ought to have averred it
before, or have given it in evidence, and so he prayed judgment for the
Plaintiff. Roll chief Justice, you mistake the exception, for they say that Mr.
Henly is pardoned by the Act, and so cannot be damnified by the words if they
were true, and so they are not actionable. Twisden, By their pleading it
appears not, that Mr. Henly is within the pardon, for there are many persons
excepted out of it. Roll chief Justice, But if it be so, yet if the words do
not relate to him as an Officer they are not actionable. Wild, The words are
spoken intentionally in relation to his Office. Roll chief Justice, He was not
an Officer at the time of the words spoken, for he was sequestered, and then
what scandal can they be to him. Wild, The Jury has found that he was
damnified, though the words were true. The first question here is, whether the
words, as they are laid, relate to his Office, for he is not an Officer, nor
can the Action be brought by him as he is so, but this is not much to the
purpose: but the deceit alleged to be done to the State charged upon him is the
cause of the Action, and it is said that he deceived the State in his
composition, for his fine, and for foisting words into the order, and if he
foisted not any words into any order then he did it not into this. Averment.
And there is no need to aver Whitwicks life, for he could not receive the
profits of the Office if Whitwick were dead, and therefore he shall be intended
to he alive; and there does damage arise to the Plaintiff by the speaking of
the words, for he is in danger thereby of sequestration by such foisting of the
words; and in the common understanding of the words they shall be taken to be
meant of falsifying of the Committees order, and one man ought not to slander
another; and say that you had not notice of the Ordinance touching which he is
slandered, it is not to the purpose, for you ought to take notice of the
Ordinance. Newdigate Justice, to the same effect, that the words are
actionable, for as they are laid, Henly is brought thereby within the compass of
Sequestration, and the words in themselves are actionable, because they
instance in what thing he cosened the State, and the subsequent words do not
qualify the former, but aggravate the matter, Judgment for the Plaintiff.
and I conceive it not necessary to aver Whitwicks life, but if it be, it is
averred here; and so judgment was given for the Plaintiff, nisi, etc.

A Writ of error was brought to reverse a judgment given in an Action of
Trespass in the Common Pleas upon a demurrer, Error to reverse a judgment in
Trespass. Discontinuances.
the error assigned was, that there were discontinuances in the Process, and it
was showed by Howell of Council with the Defendant in the Writ of error that
this is helped by the late Statute, which says, that no Writ of error shall
stay execution, and Judgments upon Demurrers, as this is, are within the
Statute. Roll chief Justice. By your reason a Writ of error will not now lie
for any thing. The branch of the Statute is to be intended of matter in form
only, but this is matter of substance notwithstanding the branch of the Statute
alleged. Reversed.
Therefore let the judgment be reversed, nisi, etc.

Hill. 1653. rot. 35.
YOkehurst brought an Action of Debt upon an Obligation against Scot, Debt upon
an Obligation, and a special verdict.
the Defendant pleaded non est factum. Upon this a special verdict was found,
wherein the question was, whether it was his Deed or no, because the Obligation
was, that he was bound in centem libris instead of centum libris. Green for the
Plaintiff held it a good Bond notwithstanding this mistake, False Orthography.
because centem does sound like centum, and he cited many Cases to prove, that
mis-writing of words in an Obligation shall not hurt it, as Hob. 34. Trigintat.

seventeen, 9 H. 6. f. 7. and Pinder and Tugges case in this Court and 2 Car.
Davis his Case, and the Jury in our case have found that the Defendant did seal
and deliver the bond as his Act and Deed. Roll chief Justice, The condition of
the bond does set it forth to be 100 l. wherein the Defendant became bound,
therefore show cause the next Term why the Plaintiff should not have judgment.
Judgment.


Cooks and Chambers.
Hill. 1654. Banc. sup.
COoks moved for a Prohibition to the Prerogative Court for proceeding against
him there by way of attachment for not obeying the Decree of that Court. For a
Prohibition to the Prerogative Court.
The Case was this, Cooks and Chambers being in suit in the Prerogative Court
for Letters of administration of the Goods and Chattels of one that dyed
intestate, at last they agreed by consent, that Cooks upon putting in bond to
perform the decree of the Prerogative Court, touching the distribution of the
Intestates estate should have the administration granted unto him whereupon he
did enter into bond, and had the Letters of administration granted unto him,
and afterward the Court made an order or decree that he should distribute the
estate in such and such manner, and for not-performing of this decree Chambers
proceeds against him in the Prerogative Court by way of Attachment. It was
urged against the Prohibition that this Court is now absolute by the late
Statute, and that there is no appeal from it, and that the decree made was made
by consent of the parties, and therefore it was no reason to grant a
Prohibition to hinder that Court from forcing the party to perform the decree,
Sergeant Twisden answered, that the consent of the parties cannot give a
Iuridiction to that Court which they had not before. Roll chief Justice, That
is true, but by consent peradventure it may be as it is here, but they cannot
compel them to consent, and they have no authority given them by the late
Statute, but they have only their old authority, and it would be dangerous to
out the old, and here is a decree made by consent of both parties:
Administration by consent.
but bring us Presidents where a Prohibition has been granted after an
administration granted by consent as this is. At another day Latch moved again
for the Prohibition, and said, that the attachment was granted beyond the
Condition of the Bond given in Court, and they have no power to award it,
notwithstanding the distribution of the estate be not made according to the
bond, for the Ordinance of Paliament gives them no such authority. 2ly. They
cannot order such a distribution of the estate, notwithstanding our consent,
for our consent was, that the clear estate only should be distributed, and not
the whole estate, and we have six presidents here to prove that they ought to
proceed upon the Bond, and not as they have done, and we could have brought a
hundred to the same purpose if we had thought it needful; And their giving of
us the administration upon the bond given, does abridge them from making any
order to distribute the estate, or to proceed by attachment, and Slaynyes case,
Hob. f. 85. and Tucker and Loans case, Hob. 191. were cited. Wild on the other
side agreed the books cited, but said, here is the consent of the parties, that
the administration should be as it is here, and that agreement was before the
administration granted. Roll chief Justice, Will you consent to bring an Action
upon the Bond, and waive the prohibition. Answer to this to morrow. No
Attachment.
At another day it was moved again, and then Roll chief Justice answered,
Proceed upon the Bond, for they cannot grant an attachment for not performing
the decree, although it was made by consent. Wild replied, This being a Decree
made by consent, they have submitted to it, and the attachment is granted for
disobedience to the Court who made the decree, and the late Ordinance does give
them power to commit such as shall disobey the decrees and orders of the Court.
Roll chief Justice, appear, and plead to it, and try their power that way, I
believe that if parties will consent that administration shall be granted in
trust, it may be so granted, although it be not in the usual way, Prohibition
granted,
and as the Statute does direct, but the taking of the Obligation ties them up
to that remedy, and they cannot proceed by way of attachment, Therefore take a
prohibition as to the attachment, and appear to it, and try the matter.

Boil and Scarborough.
Hill. 1655. Banc. sup.
Hill. 52. r. 296.
SCarborough brought an Action upon the case in the Common pleas against Boil,
Action upon the Case upon a promise and judgment upon a Demurrer and writ of
Error to reverse it.
upon a promise, that whereas his son William did owe unto Scarborough 500 l.
and Scarborough did intend to sue a ne exeat regnum against him, to hinder him
from going out of England till he might recover his debt. Boil the Defendant
did promise that if he would forbear to sue out an ne exeat regnum against his
son William, he would pay the debt; Upon this Action the Plaintiff obtains a
judgment upon a demurrer. Whereupon Boil brings a writ of Error to reverse
this judgment. The pleading in the Common pleas was thus, the Defendant in the
Action in the Common pleas was sued by the name of of Robert Boil Esquire who
appears and pleads the Statute of limitations of Actions of 21 Iac. The
Plaintiff replies that he took out an Original against him within 6 years out of
the Chancery by the name of Robert Boil Esquire and outlawed him upon that
Original, and that afterward the Defendant Boil came in and reversed the
Outlawry, the Defendant rejoyns and says protestando, that he took not out such
an original within 6 years, for plea says, that he was a Knight at the time of
the Original sued forth, the Plaintiff sur-rejoyns that he came in and reversed
the Outlawry upon that Original, for want of proclamation, by the name of
Robert Boil Esquire, The Defendant by way of Rebutter says, that he was a
Knight at the time of the Outlawry reversed; the Plaintiff by way of
sur-rebuttter says, he reversed the outlawry by the name of Robert Boil Esquire
upon this the Defendant demurred, and upon the demurrer judgment was given for
the Plaintiff, and upon this the writ of Error was brought in this Court. The
Errors assigned were, Consideration to ground a promise.
1. That here was no good consideration for this promise, for there is no
ground of Action showed against the son, nor that he had been at any charge in
the prosecuting any action against him, and Rosyer and Landales case 1650. in
this Court, and Bedwell and Cottons case Hob. 216 was cited; Ne exeat regnum.
and 2ly. there is no such writ as an ne exeat regnum in the Register; but only
a writ to give security not to go out of the Realm to the public prejudice of
the King and his people; and here is no such matter but only that he owed 500
l. and therefore he would sue out the writ, and though the consideration should
be good, yet is not the Plaintifs replication good to tie the second writ to
the first, for he does not say that the second is pro una et eadem causa, and
so it is uncertain, Brook Trespass. 85.9 H. 6. and there may be several
promises made here in one day, and if the replication he good, Rejoinder.
yet the rejoinder is good, 19 H. 8.43. He only admits that he being a Knight
is the same person which was sued by the name of an Esquire, Hob. 171 Stukelyes
case. And here is a judgment by a nihil dicit, and no warrant of Attorney, for
it is in latin, Warrant of Attorney.
which being since the Act for Law proceedings to be in English, is not good,
and so it was prayed the judgment might be reversed. Latch on the other side
prayed to affirm the judgment, and he argued, 1. That here was a good
consideration to ground the promise upon, for this writ of ne exeat regnum may
be sued forth by any one, and here is a benefit to the party in the forbearing
to sue it forth, and here is good cause to move for this writ, and it is in the
discretion of the King to grant it or not, but it concerns him in his honor to
grant it, Regist. 193, 194. Brit. 182. Cooks instit. 130. There is caution to
be taken of persons licensed to go beyond Seas, that they pay their debts. 2ly.
The replication is good, Averment.
and it is not necessary to aver that the second Original was for the same
cause; first, because it is in an action upon the case, and is set forth at
large, which shows verbatim that it is for the same cause, and is plain in it
self; and 2ly. it is said that he sued out the second Original pro causa
praedicta, which is a sufficient averment, if an averment be necessary, and the
variance in the damages argues not that there is another cause of Action, for
when the second Original was sued forth, the damages were increased by increase
of time, it being a year after the suing forth of the first; For the rejoinder
it is to be considered, 1. Whether the party be estopped thus to plead. 2ly. If
he be not, Estoppel.
yet whether the matter set forth be good. For the 1. I hold he is estopped by
coming in gratis as an Esquire, to say that he was a Knight, and he not being
brought in custody, Dyer 192. There he shall plead no other name; but here he
has not alleged it as he ought, for he ought to conclude absque hoc that he
was an Esquire, and he has affirmed himself to be an Esquire by saying and
praedictus, etc. but he ought to have alleged specially that Robert Boil
Knight, who was sued by the name of Robert Boil Esquire: and 2 E 4. f. ^ is
against the other books, and the law is otherwise. It is true that the old book
of Entries, Title Trespass, and some other Presidents which passed sub silentio
are against me, but the Law generally is against those Presidents, as Rastal
entries brief 54.19 H. 6.1.36, 44. which say, if he come in he is estopped, Br.
Tit. De^^ 15 and 26.32 H. 6.3. 35 H. 6. and many other books, and the book of
19 H. 6.43, which is objected on the other side is against them, and Dyer, f.
58. But though he were not estopped, yet we may take advantage of the first
Original writ, for it is but abatable by the misnosmer, and so not abated; and
here is a flaw in the rejoinder, for he ought to have traversed that he was not
an Esquire, which he has not done. Abated. Abatable. Traverse.
2ly. The 26 of March is after the original sued forth, and so it is uncertain
in respect of time, when he was a Knight, Plow. 27. by Morgan, 7 H. 7.5. And
the warrant of Attorney is good, though it be in Latin, and if it were in
English it would be erroneous, for the entry is material, and the constant
practice is not to enter the warrant before the issue, Entry.
Trin. 8 Iac. Morley and Morley in this Court, and here is not the entry of the
warrant it self, but the Entry is that he is Attorney by Warrant. Roll chief
Justice, If one bring a writ of 1000 l. and it be abated, and then he bring
another writ for the same debt, may he increase the damages accrued betwixt the
first writ and the second? Certainly no, Increase of damages.
for the second writ is but the renewing of the first writ, and is not a new
writ; But here are diverse points considerable, therefore speak again to it. But
a ne exeat regnum is usually sued forth in such cases as this, Prerogative Writ.
although that originally this writ was only used in businesses which concerned
the State, and not in private cases; and the forbearance to sue it is a good
consideration to ground an Action upon. At another day the Case was again put
by Christ. Turner, and he prayed the judgment might be reversed, and in his
Argument he made these questions. 1. Whether there be a good consideration to
raise a promise, Consideration.
and he held there in not, because it does not appear that the Plaintiff had any
cause of Action Not. Brev. 85. A. a ne exeat regnum is at the suit of the King,
and not at the suit of a common person; and whereas it is objected that the
King may stay any one from going beyond Seas, I answer that he cannot stay any
one for every cause, but for a cause which concerns the State; and if there
were in our case a good cause to sue out this writ, Agreement.
the agreement betwixt the parties not to sue it out is not a good agreement,
Hob. 154. Dyer 29^. Every one may go out of the Kingdom at his pleasure. 2ly.
Here is no averment that both the Originals were sued forth for one and the
same cause, although that they agree literally, Hob. Rep. Foster and Iacksons
case. Averment.
3ly. Here is no good averment, because it cannot be thereby known for what
cause the last Original was sued forth, Cook Inst. f. 20. 4ly. Though there he
an averment, yet it is void by the parties own showing, 45 E. 3.2. 21 H. 7.24.
And our case differs from the case of 10 lib. Ass. objected, for there the
averment was the Defendants averment, but here it is the Plaintifs. Also the
damages in the first Original, and the damages in the second Original do
differ, which ought not to be; but they should agree, otherwise the Originals
shall not be presumed to be both of them for one and the same cause, 6 Rep.
Spencers case, Estopple.
12 H. 7.4. 3 H. 6.9 And the party shall not be estopped here, to say that he
was a Knight, and this misnosmer is well pleaded, for there are but two ways to
plead misnosmer, Misnosmer pleased.
and we have pleaded it one of those ways, Cooks Entries 689, 690. Tit.
Outlawries, Rastal brief 608. Tit. Trespass 610, and the presidents of 1 E.
4.3. and 21 H. 7. are with us, that he shall not be estopped, and he pleads not
expressly that he was an Esquire, but only by way of implication. Implication.
Consideration.
Sergeant Twisden on the other side prays for judgment, and he argued, 1. That
here is a good consideration, for he is entitled to have this writ by Fitz.
Not. Brev. 85. where it is said any person may make a surmise to have this
writ, for it conduces to the benefit of the Plaintiff, and of the Defendant
also, and the King may hinder any one from going beyond Sea, 9 Car. Meads case,
18 Iac. C. B, Hall and Wollers case citeb by Hobart to be adjudged, Replication
43 and 44 Eliz. Rippon and North. 2ly. The Replication is good notwithstanding
the Objection against it that here is not an averment, Averment.
that the second Original is for the same cause as the first was, for it is not
necessary to make such an averment, because that this is a special particular
Action, and not a general Action, yet here is an averment if it be necessary.
Thirdly. Here is no variance though the damages do differ, for the wrong done
is properly the cause of the Action, Cause of Action.
and not the damages suffered by the wrong, and the increase of time has made
the damages to increase, and so to differ, 26 H. 8. f. 6. in a second
deliverance, Hill. 8 Car. entered 5. Car. in this Court, this point was resolved
in Theophilus Finch and Laws case; and the Misnosmer objected is not material,
Misnosmer. Estoppel.
for he is estopped to plead it, because he appears gratis by the name of Esquire
and not upon the Sherifs retorn, Dyer 19^. he must be admitted to be the same
person, and so is estopped to say the contrary, 19 H. 6. f. 65. the Book of 19
H. 6. f. 43. is not against me, for there the party came in upon the retorn of
the Sherif, and not voluntartly as he does here. Appearance.
Also the warrant of Attorney entered in English does no hurt notwithstanding the
objection that all pleadings ought to have been in Latin at the time of the
giving of the warrant, Entry.
for a warrant of Attorney may be entered at any time, because there is no
precise time directed for the entering ot it, 1 E. 3. f. 1.24 E. 3. f. 62.15 H.
7. f. 14.4 Ed. 4. f. 13. Stat. 32 H. 8. C. ^. a warrant of Attorney entered at
any time pending the plea is good, and at the time of the entering of it by the
late Statute it ought to be in English. Roll chief Justice mutata opinione
said, he may, Increase of damages.
increase his damages by his second Action, otherwise it would be
unreasonable, for he has been delayed twenty years by the Outlawry of the
Defendant. And here is also a good consideration to ground the Action,
Consideration
viz. the forbearance to sue out this Writ of ne exeat regnum, for it is
beneficial to the Defendant, and it is for the Kings honor to grant it, and the
party by forbearing to sue it, is freed of trouble, by not being stayed in
England to be sued here. And here is no need of an averment, Averment.
for it appears that both the Originals were sued forth for one and the same
cause. But the question is, touching the manner of the pleading, whether he be
not estopped to say that he is a Knight, Estople.
and not an Esquire, and I see no reason why he should be estopped to say so,
notwithstanding his voluntary coming in to reverse the Outlawry, for he comes
in to save himself from arresting, and the lying under an Outlawry, and it
would be mischievous if he did it not, Construction.
and take all the plea together, methinks it is good, and the entry in English
is good, for it is to affirm a judgment, and being good both ways, we will
take that which makes the judgment good. Yet let it be argued again. At
another day the Case was put again, and argued by Sergeant Glyn that the
judgment was not good, and first he admitted, Consideration Averment.
that here is a good consideration to ground the Action upon. 2ly. He made
question whether there be a good averment touching the going beyond Sea, and
touching the sum, and he said, that the judgment given in the Common Pleas was
for the reason that he came in to reverse the Outlawry by the name of Esquire,
and this is by Estople: Estople.
But I conceive it is no Estople, for Knight is part of his name, and so the
Outlawry is not good, 26 H. 6. there is no Estople made by the word praedict.
But if it be an Estople, yet the Plaintiff relies not upon it in his plea, but
upon other matter, and that for these reasons, 1. Because the course of
pleading is generally so in reversing of Outlawries, as it is here, Pleading.
and so is the old book of Entries, although some Presidents run the other way,
and in the Common Pleas it has been adjudged good as it is here pleaded, and
he may well aver, that he is not the same person. 2ly. Estoples are taken
strictly against him that pleads them, and are not favored in Law, and shall
not be therefore taken by implication, Implication.
Cooks lit. f. 252. B. but if there should be an Estople here, it must be by
implication only, and there ought not to be an Estople against an Estople in
the same Record, as it would also be here, for he may as well be estopped to
say that he is a Knight, as to say that he is an Esquire. Next the Plaintifs
conclusion is not good, Conclusion.
for he relies not upon the Estople, and a good plea with an ill conclusion is
not good, 18 H. 6. f. 33. ^^ Rep. Rawlins case. Roll chief Justice, Makes he
not the conclusion upon the Record? let it be tead; upon the reading it he
said, that he relies not on the conclusion and so the Estople is relied upon.
Sergeant Twisden, In our Sur-rebutter we rely upon the Estople, although we do
it not in our rejoinder, and so it is good, Sergeant Glyn, But you do not
conclude upon the Record, to wit, whether you shall be received against the
Record, as you ought to do, 22 H. 6. f. 26. Roll chief Justice, It is in effect
said so, though it be not in express words. Finch Henage on the other side
argued in affirmance of the judgment, and said, the question is, whether his
coming in by the name of Esquire to reverse the Outlawry shall not be an
Estople to him to say afterward that he was a Knight, and I conceive it is,
Estople.
because he that comes in gratis to reverse an Outlawry shall not plead
Misnosmer, Misnosmer.
6 E. 4. f. 9. he who comes in gratis is not prejudiced if he be not allowed
this plea, but it is otherwise if he come in upon process to reverse it. 2ly.
It is less mischievous to deny the plea of Misnosmer, than to allow it where
it is not allowable, the pleading of the Misnosmer if it be not true may
invegle the Court, 10 E. 4.12. 12 E. 4. f. 6.19 H. 6. f. 8. There are 4 kinds
of Misnosmer, 4 Misnosmer.
to wit, misnosmer of the Christian name. 2ly. Of the Surname. 3ly. Of addition
of Profession. 4ly. Of addition of place, and in none of them shall misnosmer
be pleaded where the party comes in gratis, Br. Misnosmer 48. and 3 E. 4.5. 27

Misnosmer 8.39 H. 6.1 E. 4. and as the case here is he is estopped to plead
misnosmer by reversing of the Outlawry which is a matter of Record, Estople.
and by it he has confirmed his name to be so, 19 H. 6. f. 1.7 Ed. 4. f. 1.
Although he might plead Misnosmer if he came in by a Cepi, yet there he may
also plead another way specially if he will, and it will be good also, 19 H. 6.
f. 1. Nor has he here relied upon his Plea of Misnosmer, but upon the want of
Proclamation, and he reversed the Outlawry by the name of Esquire, and yet now
he will say that he was a Knight, which is unreasonable, 34 H. 6. Fitzh.
Protest. 7. and this is an allegation contra factum suum proprium. Here is a
second original, Original.
and that is a good Original within the Statute; and it appears, that this
second Original is against the same party, and so he acknowledges by the
Record, by which the Court may be ascertained, that he was the same person, and
his Addition mis-named shall do no hurt. And the second Original is good as the
Court has agreed upon opening of the Case. Roll chief Justice, he reverseth
the Outlawry as an Esquire, and afterward says he is a Knight. He may come in
without Process to reverse the Outlawry, Outlawry.
where his person or estate is endangered by it, 39 E. 3. in Debt, 38 E. 3. but
he cannot plead Misnosmer, yet he may protest, that he is a Knight, and save
himself in another suit which may be brought against him. If he have pleaded
right you agree, that he is not estopped here, and it appears that he is the
same person, and comes in gratis by this name, Original.
yet it is no estople. And the second Original is good, for it appears that he
is the same person, and that by the Statute, notwithstanding the variance, and
he may come in gratis without process, and take advantage of the error. But
argue again to the point, whether he may bring a second Original by the
Statute. At another day it was argued again, but I could not hear, but 33 H. 6.
f. 19. and 50. was cited, that there ought to be a mutual Estople, Mutual
Estople.
viz. on the part of the Plaintiff, and of the part of the Defendant. Roll chief
Justice, It appears to be one and the same party, and we must maintain Actions
against the Statute of Limitations, because by that Statute the benefit of the
Law is taken away in part. Judgment affirmed.
Therefore let the Judgment be affirmed.

that to make a suspension of rent reserved upon a lease for years, the Lessor
must out the Lessee of part of the thing let at least, and hold him out till
after the day on which the rent is made payable by the lease, and if the Lessee
reenters the rent is revived. It was also then said by Roll chief Justice,
That if one have a lease for years of land by Deed, and during the term the
Lessee accepts to hold the lands for a lesser term by parol, Surrender of Lease.
this is a surrender of the Lease by Deed. It was then also said, if there be a
lease for years rendering rent at a day, with a clause of re-entry for not
payment; If the Lessor do enter into part of the lands let before the day of
payment, and at the day he makes a demand of the rent; Notwithstanding this
demand, and a non payment of the rent follows thereupon, whereupon the Lessor
reenters, Avoidance of a Lease.
yet shall not this re-entry make the Lease void, for the rent was suspended at
the time of the demand.

The Protector and the Town of Colchester.
Pasch. 1655. Banc. sup.
BErnardiston being removed from his Recorders place of the Town of Colchester
in Essex by the Baylifs and Common Council of the said Town, Return of a Writ
of restitution to a Recorders place.
prayed for his writ of restitution to the Bailifs and Common Council thereof
to be restored, and has it, and upon the return they set forth the causes why
they removed him, and why he ought not to be restored, which were to this
effect. First, that he being Recorder of that Town, at a quarter Sessions held
there before him and others, one Good-all was endicted for having two wives,
and convicted thereof, and prayed his Clergy, and was denied it by Bernardiston
the Recorder, and was condemned to die, and was reprieved, and after at another
Sessions held, there he was notwithstanding his former judgment admitted to
his Clergy. 2. That he neglected to sit at the public Sessions of the Peace,
which ought to have been held for that Town, whereby the Sessions could not be
held. 3. He made one his Deputy, who was not an utter Barister, as he ought to
be, and contracted with him for 40 l. a year to execute his place. 4ly. He
neglected for along time to sit in Court, whereby causes ready for trial could
not be tried in delay of Justice. Latch of Council for Bernardiston to the
first exception answered, That though he had proceeded erroniously to deny the
Clergy to Good all, yet this being not done as he was Recorder, but as he was
one amongst others of the Commissioners of Oyer and Terminer, which Commission
was but to endure for a year, Distinct power.
and was a distinct power from the Recorders power, and was executed by him
together with other Commissioners, it was no cause to remove him. To the 2 he
answered, that there does not appear by the return that any body received any
prejudice by his not sitting in Court to hold the Sessions, Prejudice.
nor that there was any cause to hold a Sessions, and the Sessions which they
suppose was appointed to be held was an illegal appointment of them, for it
appears not to be appointed by those that had authority to appoint, or to hold
them, Authority.
and so no fault appears in the Recorder for not holding them. 3ly. The
Justices are mis-named, for they are called the Justices of the Borough,
Misnosmer.
whereas it should be the Justices of the King. 4ly. Here does not appear to be
any appointment at all of any quarter Sessions, and so there can be no fault
for not holding them; and it is not necessary (as it is suggested) for him to
make an utter Barister his Deputy, Deputy Recorder. General accusation. Malum
in se.
but saying he was not a fit person to be his Deputy is too general an
accusation, for they ought to show in what he was insufficient, neither does
his contracting with him for money to execute the place for him, any ways
concern the corporation, nor is it malum in se, but is only punishable by the
Statute of 5 Ed. 6. and as to the not trying of the issues joined in that
Court, at the days they were to he tried upon, this is no cause to deprive him
of his place, which is a freehold, Freehold.
for few Stewards of Corporations do otherwise than he has done, for they
usually stay till they have a competent number of causes to try before they
will sit to try them, and there appears to be but 5 causes untryed, which is no
great number, neither does it appear that be had any notice that these five
were ready for trial, Notice.
and so here cannot be so great an offense as is supposed, and he cited
Semaigns case Rep. ^3. nor does it appear that any trial was disappointed by
his absence, for it appears not that any issue was joined in any of the causes,
or any warning given for trial during the time that is surmised for him to
neglect to fit in Court; And besides, though these were sufficient crimes for
to deprive him of his place, yet they have not proceeded against him in a legal
way, Illegal proceeding. Defense.
for he was never called to answer the crimes objected against him, but is
deprived without hearing his defense, which is illegal, as Sir James Baggs case
is. Roll chief Justice, he ought to be heard what he could say for himself,
else how could it be known whether there were just cause to remove him or no,
and it is very hard to deprive one of his freehold without hearing him. At
another day Sergeant Twisden moved the Court for their opinion, whether
Bernardiston ought to be restored or no, and answered the exceptions formerly
taken much to the effect as Latch had done. Whereupon Roll chief Justice said,
you ought to have convented him before you put him out, to hear what excuse he
could make for his absence, otherwise how could you know whether he had just
cause or not for his absence, Restored, nisi, etc.
Therefore let him be restored except cause be showed to the contrary Saturday
next. Postea.

Upon a trial at the Bar in a Trespass and Ejectment between Edwards Plaintiff,
and Stiff Defendant, the evidence being long and the Weathet hot, the Jury
desired they might have drink, which the Court granted, but said they should
have it at the Bar, whereupon drink was sent for for them, and they drunk it
there before they went out to consider of the evidence. Roll chief Justice did
then reprove the Attorneys and Sollicitors for the great charges they used to

insisting upon this, that there was no miscarriage on his part: Whereupon Roll

The Protector and Gunter.
Pasch. 1655. Banc. sup.
THe Court was moved to quash two Endictments for continuing of purprestines in
the high way, To quash two Endictments.
and it was urged by the Council that there were 4 Endictments preferred
against his Clyent, two for erecting the purprestures, and the other two for
the continuing of them, and upon a trial we were found not guilty of the
erecting them, and therefore we cannot be guilty of the continuing of them, and
he took this exception to the caption of the Endictments, viz. That it is said
that the Endictments were preferred at the Sessions held at East. Grinsteed in
the County of Sussex, where it ought to have been at the Sessions of the Peace
held at East-Grinsteed for the County of Sussex. Roll chief Justice answered,
You may be guilty for continuing of that which another did erect, and not you,
but if the erecting and continuance be mentioned in one and the same Endictment
you cannot be guilty. Denied.
But plead to them, for no such thing appears in the Record, but only that you
kept the Highway stopped, but says not who stopped it.

Pasch. 1655. Banc. sup.
THe Court was moved to quash an Endictment grounded upon the Statute of 5

not having served as an Apprentise in that Trade, according to the Statute,
upon these 2 Exceptions, 1. It is said he used the Trade in the year 1653. and
does not say the year of our Lord. 2ly. It is not said that the Jury was
returned, nor whence they were, and both exceptions were held good by Roll
chief Justice, and the Endictment was thereupon quashed. Quashed.

It is said by an Ordinance of the Protector made such a day, and does not say
in that case provided. Quashed.
And upon these Exceptions it was quashed.

One Mr. Conye a Counceller at the Bar was examined upon his Oath to prove the
death of Sir Thomas Conye. Whereupon Sergeant Maynard urged to have him
examined on the other part, as a witness in some matters whereof he had been
made privy as of Counsel in the cause. But Roll chief Justice answered, He is
not bound to make answer for things which may disclose the secrets of his
Clyents cause, Not to disclose a Clyents cause.
and thereupon he was forborne to be examined.

Pilkinton and Bagshaw.
Pasch. 1655. Banc. sup.
Upon a trial to be had at the Bar between Pilkington and Bagshaw, Trial at the

the Plaintiff would not put in his writ that the trial might go on; Whereupon
Roll chief Justice bid the Crier to call the Attorney of the Plaintiff to
appear, and to bring in the writ upon pain of 20 l. and said, Pain of 20 l.
Attorney put out of the Roll. Non-sute upon the Record.
that if he brought it not in he should be put out of the Roll. Sergeant
Maynard moved, that if he brought not in the writ that the Plaintiff might be
called non-sute upon the Record, which Roll chief Justice answered might well
be, because the parties have day in Court by the Record or Roll; afterward the
Solicitor who had the writ brought it in; yet Roll chief Justice said, There
shall, notwithstanding the writ be brought in, be 20 l. fine set upon him for
his trifling with the Court.

The Protector and Sumner.
Pasch. 165^. Banc. sup.
Sergeant Bernard moved that Sumner that appeared in Court upon his habeas
corpus directed to the Keeper of Northampton Gaol might be bailed, To bail a
prisoner denied.
for that having killed two men upon the Highway the Jury had found it
Manslaughter se defendendo. Roll chief Justice answered, The Iuries conclusion
is contrary to their premises. Therefore let the prisoner be sent to
Northampton Gaol whence he came, yet that may not be, for the fact was done in
Peterborough, Trial. Writ ad re^piendum.
and therefore he cannot be tried at Northampton, therefore let him be sent to
Peterborough Gaol with a writ ad recipiendum to the Jailer there to take charge
of him.

Pilkington versus Bagshaw.
Pasch. 1655. Banc. sup.
IN a Trial at the Bar in a Trespass and Ejectment betwixt Pilkington and
Bagshaw, Trespass and Ejectment.
the question being whether Copyhold lands may be entailed by the custom of the
Manor, It was said that if Tenant in tail, and the issue in tail of Copyhold
lands in tail join in a surrender in a Court Baron of the Copyhold lands,
Estopel. Copyhold lands in tail. Customary entail. Fine. State enjoyed. Seizure
of Cepyhold lands.
that this is not an estopel, for it ought to be by fine or deed indented. And
Roll chief Justice said, that Copyhold lands in tail are not within the Statute
of Westminster. 2. but it is a Customary entail like in its nature to another entail,
and such an estate must be docked by fine, or by some other customary way. It
was also said by him, that if Copies of Court Rolls be showed to prove a
Customary estate, the enjoynment of such estates must also be proved, otherwise
the proof is not good. It was also said upon the evidence, That a seizure by
the Lord made of Copyhold entailed lands within the Manor of Wakefield in
Yorkshire is in the nature of a recovery to deck the entail, and that the
manner of doing it is either for the Copyholder to let his Copyhold for more
years than he ought, or to refuse to do his service, and then the Lord seifes
the lands for a forfeiture, and grants it to another by the consent of the
Copyholder that made the forfeiture. It was then also said by Roll chief
Justice, Custom.
that a Custom cannot be urged for a thing that had its beginning since Rich.
the 1. if a Record can be showed to the contrary. Common recovery. Recompense
in value. Custom. Copyhold destroyed.
It was also said by him that a common recovery suproseth a recompense in value
to all persons who lost the estate by the recovery. He said also that he
conceived that there could be no such Custom to cut off entails of Copyhold
lands by the forfeiture and seizure of the Lord, for his seizure upon the
forfeiture destroys the Copyhold estate by the Common Law, for it is in the
Lords election after the seizure whether he will grant the estate again or no,
and you do not prove that the Custom binds him to it. Nota.

and thereupon the Defendant brought his writ of Error to reverse the judgment

therefore they desired the judgment might be affirmed, because that otherwise
satisfaction of the judgment cannot be acknowledged upon the Roll, because the
Court of Common Pleas were forclosed to do any thing further upon the judgment
given there by reason of the writ of Error. But Roll chief Justice answered, It
cannot be, Denied.
for you show no cause why we should affirm the judgment, and therefore we
will make no rule in it, but enter satisfaction upon the Roll if you will at
your own peril.

Pasch. 1655. Banc. sup.

The Protector and the Town of Colchester.
Pasch. and Trin. 1655. Banc. sup.
Upon a Mandamus to the Bailifs of Colchester to restore Bernardiston to the
Recorders place of that Town, Exceptions to a return of a Mandamus to the Town
of: Colchester.
upon the return they certified the causes for removing him, and why he ought
not to be restored. 1. That one Good all being endicted upon the Statute for
having two wives, and convicted thereof did pray his Clergy, and was refused it
by Bernardiston, and was condemned to die, and after at another Sessions he
admitted him to his Clergy, and so he was burnt in the hand. 2ly. That he
neglected to sit at the Sessions, whereby the Sessions for the Town could not
be held duly as they ought to have been. 3ly. That he appointed a Deputy
Recorder to execute his place for him, who was not an utter Barrester, and
contracted with him for 40 l. per annum. 4ly. That he neglected to hold Courts
whereby causes could not be tried, to the prejudice of many. Latch of Council
with Bernardiston to the first cause answered, That although it was an Error in
Judgment to deny the Clergy where it should have been granted; yet this was
not committed as he was Recorder of the Town, but as a Commissioner of Oyer and
Terminer, which was to endure but for a year, and was a distinct power from his
power as he was Recorder, and executed by him, with other Commissioners that
were joined with him in Commission. To the second he answered, that here does
not appear to be any prejudice to any by his not holding the Sessions, nor that
there was any cause to hold them, and besides, it does appear, that the
Sessions where he neglected to sit were not legally appointed to be held, for
they were appointed by them that had no authority to do it, viz. by the Mayor
and Baylifs, whereas they ought to be appointed by the Mayor, Baylifs, and
Recorder; and next the Justices are mis-named, for they are called the Justices
of the Borough, whereas they ought to be called the Justices of the King. 4ly.
Here does not appear any appointment at all of the Quarter Sessions. To the 3d.
he answered, that it is not necessary that he should appoint a Barrester to be
Deputy-Recorder, and to say that he was not fit to be Deputy-Recorder is too
general a charge, but it ought to be showed in what he was unfit, and his
contracting with him for money concerns not the Coporation, neither is it malum
in se, but is only punishable by the Statute of 5 Ed. 6. And as to the last,
viz. his neglecting to try the issues joined at the days appointed it is not a
crime material to deprive him of his free hold, and few Stewards do otherways,
for they do usually stay till they have a competent number of Causes to try,
before they will sit; and here are but six causes alleged to be untryed, and
one of them was not tryable in that place, nor is it averred, that he had
notice given him of any issues to be tried, and so the offense is the less, 5
Rep. Semaignes case, nor does it appear, that any trial was disappointed by his
absence, for it appears not that there was any issues joined, or any warning
given for trial in any of the Causes during the time alleged, wherein it is
said he did for bear to sit to try them. Lastly, here is no just way of
proceeding to deprive him of his place though he might be deprived, for he was
never summoned to appear to answer the matters objected against him, as he
ought to have been, and so is Cook in Sir James Baggs case. Sergeant Glyn on
the same side insisted only upon the last matter urged by Latch, which he said
went through the whole Case. Roll chief Justice, He ought to have been heard,
how else can it be known whether they had just cause to remove him or not, and
it is very hard to deprive one of his freehold without hearing him make his
defense. The Court was moved at another day for their opinion, and then
Sergeant Twisden endeavored to answer some exceptions taken to the retorn by
Windham, and to make good the exceptions taken against Bernardiston, much to
the same effect as formerly. Whereupon Roll chief Justice answered, you ought
to have convented him before you had put him out, that you might have heard
what excuse he could make for his absence, else how can it be known, whether he
had a just cause of absence or not. Therefore let him be restored, nisi,
Judgment nisi.
etc. At another day, being in Trinity Term 1655. Sergeant Maynard showed for
cause why he ought not to be restored, 1. That he held not the Courts duly, but
did absent himself for sixteen months, without any cause, to the endangering of
the forfeiture of the Charter of the Town, and s^^d, that if an Officer of
Record do wilfully and without cause absent himself from his Office, it is a
for feiture thereof, for by so doing the Charter is forfeited, Forfeiture of an
Office.
and here is no supposition of any excuse. 2ly. The retorn is good, though no
notice was given him, for he ought to take notice of himself as he is an
Officer of that Court, and endict him they cannot, and if his offense be true
de facto they may put him out of his place, as a Master may put away his
Servant, and this their Charter warrants them to do Twisden on the same side
said, he has contracted with another for his place, and so is disabled by the
Statute. Wild, He could not be here convented, for it is expressly said, that he
went to unknown places. Glyn chief Justice, The main business insisted on was
his absence, but here was no notice given to him, and you ought not to proceed
against him, and never hear him, though the crime objected against him be true,
for it may be he was sick or had some other just excuse for his absence, and he
ought also to be heard to all the other crimes objected against him. Therefore
let him be restored, nisi, etc. to morrow. Judgment nisi.


Howard and Howard.
Trin. 1655. Banc. sup.
MY Lord Howard being taken by a Latitat out of this Court appeared upon the
day of the retorn of the Writ in Court, Peerage pleaded.
and pleaded his privilege of Peerage, and demands in judgment of the Writ,
and thereupon to be discharged. Powis of Council against him moved, that he
might put in special bayl. Bayl. Demurrer.
Glyn chief Justice, You ought to demur to his Plea, for he is now in Custodia,
and therefore he need not put in bayl. Nota.

The Protector and Norrice.
Trin. 1655. Banc. sup.
NOrrice being committed to prison for speaking words against the Parliament in
the year 1650. was thereupon endicted, To discharge a Prisoner upon the Act of
Oblivion.
and was convicted and fined 100 l. and ordered to lie in prison until he
could find Sureties for his good behavior; afterward he was brought into
Court by virtue of a Habeas Corpus, and his Council moved on his behalf that he
might be discharged, because he was pardoned by the Act of Oblivion. It was
urged against this for the Protector, that he may be a person excepted out of
the Act, Surmise.
and therefore ought not upon this surmise to be delivered. Glyn chief Justice,
It does not appear to us that he is not excepted, and therefore we cannot
deliver him. Thereupon it was moved for the Prisoner for a Certiorari to remove
the Record hither, Certiorari. Entry.
whereby he stands convicted, that he might enter the suggestion upon it, that
he is pardoned by the Act. Glyn chief Justice, Tax it.

Webberly and Sir John Lenthall.
Trin. 1655. Banc. sup.
THe Court was moved for Webberly against Sir John Lenthall, Motion against Sir
John Lenthall for detaining a Prisoner discharged. Action money. False
imprisonment. Endictment.
that whereas he being a Prisoner in the Upper Bench prison for Debt. and
having agreed with his Creditors was discharged by them, yet Sir John Lenthall
did keep him Prisoner till he should pay him Action money. Glyn chief Justice,
You have two remedies against Sir John Lenthall for this, for either you may
bring your Action of false imprisonment against him, or you may endict him for
extortion. Yet let Sir John show cause why he should not discharge him paying
his fees.

Strowd and Keckwith.
Trin. 1655. Banc. sup.
Mich. 1653. rot. 119.
STrowd brought an Audita querela against Keckwith. Audita querela.
The Case was this, Strowd acknowledged a Judgment 17 Car. for 2000 l. upon
which Judgment an Elegit was taken forth against Strowds lands in the County
of B. and lands thereupon were found and extended, and delivered to the
Counsee, and the Elegit filed, and the lands enjoyed accordingly for six years,
then the Counsee dies and makes his wife Executrix, who takes out a Scire
facias upon the Judgment for 2000 l. directed the Sherif of the County of C.
being another County, and upon two Nichils returned has judgment and execution
against Strowd for the same Debt, who thereupon brings his Audita querela.
Wadham Windham held, that the Audita querela did lie and cited 15 H. 7.7. and
L. Q. f. 40. and said this was an illegal proceeding against Strowd, because
that after an Elegit executed no other execution lies, but where there bath
been no execution of lands in the same County or in another upon the first
Elegit, but here is land found, Execution.
and the Elegit filed, and the lands enjoyed, Elegit to diverse Counties. No
Elegit after an Elegit. Judgment.
18 E. 12. Fitzh. tit. Execution 240. Dyer 1^2. an Elegit may be prayed to
diverse Counties. Glyn chief Justice, The Case is adjudged in Hobard^ Reports,
that one cannot have an Elegit after a former Elegit, if lands be thereby
found, and the Elegit filed. Therefore show cause why judgment shall not be
given for the Plaintiff.

Price and Carr.
Hill. 1654. Banc. sup.
PRice brought an Action upon the Case against Carr for speaking these words of
her, A pox upon you for a Welsh whore, Arrest of judgment in an Action on the
Case for words.
for thou wentest into the Country and emptiedst thy Ca^k of a Bastard. After a
verdict for the Plaintiff it was moved in arrest of Judgment, that the former
words videlicet, the saying the was a Welsh Whore are not actionable, because
no Action lies at the Common Law for calling a woman Whore, and the last words
are uncertain words, and less actionable. The judgment was then stayed till
the Plaintiff should move. Whereupon at another day the Plaintiff moved for
judgment, and a Case in 1^ Iac. in this Court was cited, and 41 Eliz. Wheeler
and A^^g^ls case, and it was urged, that the words shall be interpreted
according to common intention and understanding of the hearers, and shall be
adjudged very scandalous. Wild on the other side said, they are frivolous words
and not to be regarded, for they do not say positively she is a Whore, nor that
she had a Bastard, but the words are of a very uncertain meaning, for it
appears not when the words were spoken, or when she went into the Country, nor
is there any averment what is meant by the words. Glyn chief Justice, Words
actionable.
Now since the Act, the calling of a woman Whore, and saying the had a Bastard
will bear an Action, and here are words certain enough to fix a particular
Scandal upon the party, by application of the words, and they are made more
than general words or words of heat and passion, for there is a general
application of them, and a sufficient averment, and for the time of speaking
them we will not presume they were spoken four years since, which was before
the late Statute made against Adultery. Judgment.
Therefore let the Plaintiff have her Judgment.

Davis and Matthews.
Pasch. 1655. Banc. sup.
THe Case was this, Bond put in sure in the Prerogative Court.
There being a controverste in the Prerogative Court between the Widow of one
that died intestate, and one of the intestates next kindred, who should have
Letters of Administration of the goods and Chattels of the Intestate, It was at
length agreed betwixt the parties, that the widow should have Letters of
administration, and that thereupon she should enter into Bond in the
prerogative Office, to make an equal distribution of the goods and chattels of
the intestate amongst his kindred, whereupon Letters of Administration were
committed unto her; and she afterward entered into bond accordingly, and for
not performing the condition of the bond in making an equal distribution of the
estate, the bond was put in suit in the prerogative Court, Prohibition.
upon which a prohibition was prayed, and a rule thereupon made for the
Defendant to show cause why it should not be granted, and af the day it was
offered for cause that there ought to be no prohibition, because where an
administration is granted to one unto whom the Ordinary is not bound by the
Statute to grant it, as it is in this case, there the Ordinary may take a bond
of the party, with condition to make an equal distribution of the goods; but
otherwise it is where Letters of administration are granted to one to whom by
the Statute they ought to be granted, and one Sharp and Sympsons case 14 Iac.
was cited, Ordinary.
and Hob. 191. On the other side it was urged that the Ordinary has no
authority to take such a bond for the equal distribution of the goods, and the
difference put on the other side was denied, and it was said, that when the
Ordinary has once committed the Letters of Administration to the party, Power
determined. Administration upon condition.
his power is then determined, and he cannot grant Letters of Admistration upon
Condition. Glyn chief Justice, The taking of the Bond is against the Statute,
for the wife ought to be preferred before the next of the Kin, notwithstanding
the Statute, and so is the common practice, except there be a special cause for
the contrary, as where the wife has had a former provision made for her by her
husband, Prohibition granted.
etc. Therefore let there be a prohibition, nisi.

The Protector and Craford
Trin. 1655. Banc. sup.
Upon a return of a Mandamus directed to the Master and Fellows of Gonvile and
Cayus College in Cambridge, A Mandamus to restore one to an Ushers place in a
Free School, and the return and exceptions to (...) Au hority. Notice. Action
at Law. Extraordinary course.
to restore one to an Ushers place of a Free School in Cambridge, of which they
are visiters. It was excepted against it, that they had not showed that they
had any authority to deprive the party of his place; And 2ly. It does not
appear that they gave him any notice of their proceedings against him, whereby
he might prepare to defend himself. Sergeant Twisden made question whether a
Mandamus did lie in this case, because a School masters place is a temporal
Office, and an Action at the Law lies for the party to recover it, and
therefore it seems a Mandamus, which is an extraordinary course ought not to be
granted, and he rited 8 Ass. and Sir James Bags case, and Dyer 200. and said it
is not like an Office without see. Latch on the other side answered The
Mandamus is allowed already, and the legality of it is not now to be disputed,
and Sir James Bags case is not repugnant to this case, for this is a public
office, and not a private, and tends much to the public good, Office
public, private.
and is like to the case of an Alderman, or Freeman of a Corporation, or a
Fellow of a College. Glyn chief Justice, A Mandamus to restore one to a
Churchwardens place has been adjudged good. It is true that for a private
office a writ of restitution does not lie, but if the public be concerned in
the office it does lie; and though it be an office with a fee belonging to it,
that makes no difference; for a Recorders place is an office with a fee, and
yet a writ of restitution lies for it; But it appears here that the
Schoolmaster has much abused himself, and therefore we will advise. Writ of
restitution. Office with and without a Fee. Mandamus. Freehold.
At another day this case was moved again, and then Glyn chief Justice said, I
doubt whether a Mandamus does lie in this case, for it lies not for every
taking away of a man's freebold, as in the cases of a Keeper of a Park, or a
Stewardship of a Court Baron. Wild questioned to whom the Mandamus could be
here directed, for he said that the Master and Fellows are no Corporation; and
he cited Boremans case of the Middle Temple, Corporation, Innes of Court
voluntary societies.
who prayed a Mandamus to be restored to that society, where it was held that
the Innes of Court are not Corporations, but only voluntary societies. Latch on
the other side said that it was very proper to have a Mandamus in this case,
for it is a public office, and not a private, as a Keepers place of a Park,
or a Stewards place of a Manor are; Jurisdiction.
and a Steward of a Court Leet is a public Officer: And this Court has
jurisdiction to reform all grievantes of this nature, and to keep other
jurisdictions in good order, that they do not entrench one upon another, and
here is no Visiter to whom the party may appeal, and it were very unreasonable
to leave him without remedy, and Mandamusses have been granted for places of
less consequence than this as in Pasch. 2 Car. a Mandamus was granted to
restore one to the place of Town Clark, which is a private office, and 19 Iac.
a Mandamus was granted to restore one to a common Clarks place of a Will, and 5
Car. and 18 Car. to restore the parties to Parish Clarks places. And if the
place be public this Court will not leave the party to seek his remedy at
Law, and Alderman Estwicks case is well known, who was restored to the place of
a Common Council man of London, and here the party has an employment for his
life, Employment for life.
though he have not a freehold in it, and there is a settled profit accruing to
him, and so prayed he might be restored. Wild on the other side held, that a
Mandamus lies not in this case, and said, this case differs from the cases put
on the other side; for the Schoolmaster, Durante beneplacito.
though he have a freehold, yet it is but durante beneplacito, and he is in
truth no more than a servant, and in all the cases put on the other side the
public is more concerned than in this case 11 H. 4. f. 47. A Schoolmaster
has no freehold as Skreen there held, and it is not like the case of a
Churchwarden, Churchwarden.
which is an Office that the common Law takes notice of, 12 H 7. and a Town
Clark is a public officer of the Town, and Boremans case is very like to
this; and the office of a high Steward is a public office, and so is a
Steward of a Leet, and one may put away a servant retained for his life, and so
may the Schoolmaster here be discharged, and this School is a private School,
and is not a Corporation as Westminster School is. Glyn chief Justice, by the
same rule that the Schoolmaster should be restored may ever Scholar claim to
be restored, and I conceive the Visitors may remove the Master of the School,
if he observe not the rules for government of the School, and it seems as
reasonable for them to turn out the Masters, as to receive them into the place.
But let the whole matter be referred to the Justices of the Assize, one of
whom, viz. my Lord chief Justice St. John, Referrence
is the Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, where the School is.

Fowke and Prescott.
Trin. 1655. Banc. sup:
FOwke brought an Action upon the case upon a promise against Prescott. The
Case was this, Arrest of judgment in an Action upon the case upon a promise.
Prescott being a Coachman did by careless driving of his Coach break a pipe of
wine of Fowkes which lay in the street, whereby much of the wine ran out; and
was lost: Fowke apprehends the Coachman, who thereupon promises that if he
would for bear to sue him for the wine, that he would pay him as much as he had
damnified him, and for breach of this promise he brings his Action, and obtains
a verdict against the Defendant. It was moved in Arrest of judgment, 1. That
the Plaintiff had not averred how much the wine was worth that was spilt, and so
he could not tell what satisfaction to make the Plaintiff for it, Averment.
for he knows not the value. Request.
2ly. Here does not appear to be any request made for the satisfaction by the
Plaintiff. Sergeant Twisden answered, Here does appear to be an apparent damage,
and he has not satisfied the damage we have laid in our Declaration, nor has
the Defendant pleaded any tender of damages at all, Tender of damages.
Implication. Notice.
and the Jury have found the damages. 2ly. We say that we have forborne to sue
him, and this implies no satisfaction made at the time of the Action brought.
Alleyne on the other side, The Plaintifs Declaration does not entitle him to
the Action, and the finding of the Jury cannot make this good. Glyn chief
Justice, Both parties did see the wine, and the Defendant is bound to take
notice of the damage, and the Plaintiff is not bound to give him notice,
Judgment.
and the Jury has made it certain, Therefore let the Plaintiff have his
judgment.

Dod and Herbert
Trin. 1655. Banc. sup.
DOd brought an Action of Debt upon an Obligation to stand to an award,
Demurrer in debt upon an Obligation to stand to an Award. Satisfaction Charges.
Submission. In Curia prolata.
against Herbert, the Defendant pleaded nil debet, and upon a Demurrer these
exceptions were taken to the Award, why it should not be good: 1. That here is
100 l. awarded to be paid to the party, and it does not appear that it is to be
paid unto him in satisfaction of the wrong done unto him. 2ly. Here is 8 l.
ordered to be paid for charges and expenses, which thing is not submitted unto
by the parties, and so no Award ought to be made for them. 3ly. The Action here
is merely grounded upon the Award, and therefore the award ought to have been
brought into Court, which is not done for ought appears here. Wild on the other
side answered, that upon the penning of the whole Award, it appears that the
100 l. is to be paid for the wrong done to the party by the speaking of the
scandalous words, and the Award is set forth to be made de et super praemissis,
De and super praemissis.
which makes it good, as my Lord chief Justice Rolls opinion was upon the first
opening of the Record, and so was Burbidges case 16 Car. And as is the second
Exception he held, that the 8 l. awarded to be paid for charges was within the
submission, for the Arbitators have power to allow charges: And as to the last
Exception, he said it is not necessary to produce the Award in Court. Glyn
chief Justice, It is to be intended that the 100 l. is to be paid for the wrong
done, Intendment.
and the 8 l for costs is as well within the submission as the other, and the
Award is recited, and it is said to be made de et super praemissis. The only
question is, whether the Award ought to be produced in Court, and I conceive it
is not necessary to do it, although he must plead the Award in writing, for the
Action is not brought upon the Award, but upon the submission, for the Award is
but the inducement, and the Court has nothing to do with the Award,
Submission. Inducement.
but to see whether it be in writing or no; For a Deed, that must I confess, be
produced in Court, that the Court may judge whether it bind the party or not,
and you your selves have here set forth the Award in your pleading, But speak
to it at another day, at which time the case being only put, Glyn chief Justice
said, if an Action of debt be brought upon an Obligation, Where a thing must be
produced.
the Obligation ought to be produced and in all other cases where things cannot
be demanded but by Deed; otherwise is it, if they may be demanded either by
Deed, or without Deed; but here is no Deed in the case, for an Arbitrament
under seal is no Deed, and the arbitrament may be made without a Deed, Deed.
Arbitrament. Writing. Judgment nisi.
and therefore it is not necessary to be produced in Court, for it is but a
writing under hand and seal. Iudicium nisi pro quereute.

Maynell and Mackallye.
Trin. 1655. Banc. sup.
MAynell brought an Action upon the Case against Mackallye, Arrest of judgment
in an Action upon the case upon a promise.
and declared, That whereas he had an intent to enter an Action against the
Defendant, and to arrest him at such a time, the Defendant in consideration
that the Plaintiff would forbear to arrest him at that time did promise that he
would put in bail to him at any time after when he shall enter his action
against him, and for breach of this promise he brings his Action. Upon non
assumpsit pleaded, and a verdict for the Plaintiff, it was moved in Artest rest
of judgment, That it is not said how long the Plaintiff should forbear to
arrest the Defendant, Consideration. Declaration. Reasonable construction.
Judgment.
and it may be for so little time that it will not be a good consideration to
ground the promise. But it was answered, that it is well enough, for the
declaration pursues the words of the agreement between the parties, and cannot
be better expressed. Glyn chief Justice, It is a good consideration, and we
must make reasonable construction of words, Therefore let the Plaintiff have his
judgment.

and upon not guilty pleaded, and a verdict found for the Plaintiff, and a
judgment thereupon given, upon a writ of Error brought this Exception was
taken, that the verdict found the wife only guilty, and yet the judgment was
given against Baron and Feme, which was urged to be Error, but 9 E. 4. was
cited on the other side, that the judgment is well given. Glyn chief Justice,
The Jury have found the wife guilty, and so the Declaration is true, and
therefore just cause of Action, and the judgment well given.

Williams and Probe.

Williams brought an Action upon the case for speaking these words of her,
Arrest of judgment in an Action for words.
viz. Thou art a Whore, and I will prove thee a Whore, and thou have made my
house a Bawdy house. After a verdict it was moved in Arrest of judgment that
the words are not actionable, because they do not imply that she had played the
whore her self, though she had made the Plaintifs house a Bawdy house. But Glyn
chief Justice answered, If we take all the words together as they are laid they
are actionable, for they are particular applicable words, Particular applicable
words. Judgment.

whereas it was laid in Northumberland, and Franklin and Sir William Butlers
case, and Bear and Jones his case of the Middle Temple were cited to prove that
a Barrester ought to have this privilege, that where any transitory Action is
brought against him, he may have it laid in Middlesex, wheresoever the cause of
Action was. The Court advised, and desired to see the presidents cited. At
another day it was moved again, and upon the presidents produced, Granted.
It was ordered to lay the venue in Middlesex accordingly.

because the Inquisition returned did only find his goods he was possessed of
in London. Glyn chief Justice, You may have a melius inquirendum, it being for
the Protector, if the practice of the Court will allow it, but it must be
directed to the Sherif, Sherif. Coroner.
because the Coroner has done his office already, and has nothing now to do

Arrest of judgment in debt upon an Obligation.
that the Obligation upon which the Action was brought was for the payment of
100 l. and the Plaintiff declares for 80 l and so the Declaration varies from
the bond. 2ly. It is said that the Action was entered in the same Counter,
whereas there was no mention of any Counter before, neither does it appear that
the Counter is a Court. Glyn chief Justice answered, the first exception is to
no purpose, and for the second it is but an exception to a surplusage, which
might have been left out of the Declaration, and it is also after a verdict.
Surplusage. Judgment.
Therefore let the Plaintiff have his judgment.

that the Defendant would give unto his two daughters 20 l. a piece, and after a
Verdict in an Action upon the case brought by one of his daughters for breach
of this promise, It was moved in Arrest of judgment, that the Plaintiff had
declared upon a joint promise made which concerned another with the Plaintiff,
and yet the Action is brought but by one of them, Joint promise.
whereas they ought to have joined in the Action. But Glyn chief Justice
answered, that the parties have distinct interests, and so any one of them may
bring an Action. Turner replied, The Declaration mentions the promise to be a
joint promise. Distinct interests.
Glyn chief Justice, But the Law does distinguish the interest, though the
Declaration be general. Sergeant Bernard, Here ought to be a several Action,
Distinction of Law. Judgment.
and so has it been lately adjudged in the Common pleas: But it was answered,
that the Action is brought but for one twenty pound due to one of the
Daughters, and so judgment for the Plaintiff, nisi, etc.

death, and thereupon he did mary the party, and yet he did not leave him half
his estate at his death. Upon a verdict found for the Plaintiff, it was moved in
arrest of judgment, that the Declaration was not good, for whereas the promise
was, that the Defendant should leave him half of all his estate, which might be
intended both of his real and also of his personal Estate, and of any estate in
reversion, as well as of an estate in possession, the Plaintiff only says, that
the Testator died worth 3000 l. in possession, and that he did not leave him
half of that estate, and it may be he left him part of his real estate, or
estate in reversion to the full value of half his whole estate. But Glyn chief

it, and for so much rent due for it for so long time in the Testators life
time, and for so much rent due since his death he brings the Action. Upon non
assumpsit pleaded, a verdict was found for the Plaintiff, and entire damages
given. It was moved in arrest of Judgment, That an Action of the Case does not
lie, it being for the non-payment of rent, which follows the nature of the
land, and does sound in the realty, for which a personal Action lies not. 2ly.
Here does not appear by the Daclaration, Personal act on. Consideration

and it is a good consideration as to him, for the executor is representative
of the Testator. And 2ly. An Action upon the Case will not lie for rent upon a

That if an Administrator bring an Action against an Administrator, it is not
necessary for the Plaintiff to show by whom the letters of Administration were

Administration were granted to himself to entitle himself to the Action, for if
it appear not to the Court that he is Administrator, he cannot sue by that name.

parties were now before the Auditors, and thereupon it was moved on the
Defendants part, that this Court would grant him time to account, for the
reasons alleged. But Wild answered, that it was not proper to move here, for
the Auditors are now Judges of the matter, Auditors Judges by the Statute.

said, the Auditors are Judges by the Statute, and therefore move before them,

Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
THe Court was informed that an Action of Debt was formerly brought against Sir
John Lenthall, and that there was Judgment, For Sir John Lenthall the
Mareschall to appear, that he might be in execution.
and an execution thereupon taken out against him, but that he ab^conded
himself, that be could not be taken, and therefore it was prayed in regard he
was an Officer of this Court that the Court would order him to appear here,
that he may be committed in execution to the Sherif of Middlesex. But Glyn
chief Justice answered, if Sir John Lenthall do appear here, and you pray him
in execution, we can commit him to no other prison but the Marshalsea, for that
is the prison of this Court, and to commit him to that prison of which he is
the Keeper, without securing the Prisoners there, before we do it, will be an
escape in Law of all the Prisoners. Therefore let Sir John show cause why he
should not pay the Debt, for it is neither for his own credit, nor the honor of
this Court, that he should not satisfy his Debts.

he did promise, etc. and this is a consideration executed, and not sufficient
to ground a promise upon, and one Hunt and Dier case was cited for proof. 2ly
He does not show what pains he has taken, and so it cannot be known whether
his pains were sufficient to ground the promise upon. 3ly. He says, that he
took pains to reconcile differences betwixt the Defendant, and I. S. and
others, and does not show who these others were. The two last exceptions were
overruled without speaking to; and to the first VVild answered, that here was
a continuing consideration, Continuing consideration.
though the pains taken were past, for it is said he took the pains at the
instance and request of the Plaintiff Glyn chief Justice, It is as you say,
Voluntary courtesy.

carry Corn in the Straw upon Horses whether the Declaration would have been
good.

VVood and Gunston.
Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
WOod brought an Action upon the Case against Gunston for speaking of
scandalous words against; For a new trial in an action of Trespass for (...)
words.
and amongst other words for calling him Traitor, and obteyns a verdict against
him at the Bar, wherein the Jury gave 1500 l. damages. Upon the supposition
that the damages were excessive, and that the Jury did favor the Plaintiff,
the Defendant moved for a new trial. But Sergeant Maynard opposed it, and said
that after a verdict the partiality of the Jury ought not to be questioned, nor
is there any Presidents for it in our Books of the Law, and it would be of
dangerous consequence if it should be suffered, and the greatness of the
damages given can be no cause for a new trial, but if it were, the damages
are not here excessive, if the words spoken be well considered, for they tend
to take away the Plaintifs estate, and his life. Windham on the other side
pressed for a new trial, and said it was a packed business, else there could
not have been so great damages, and the Court has power in extraordinary
cases, such as this is, to grant a new trial. Glyn chief Justice, Discretion of
the Court. Discretion Judicial, Arbitrary. The Court not to be intended partial.
It is in the discretion of the Court in some cases to grant a new trial, but
this must be a judicial, and not an arbitrary discretion, and it is frequent in
our Books for the Court to take notice of miscariages of Iuries, and to grant
new trials upon them, and it is for the peoples benefit that it should be so
for a Jury may sometimes by indirect dealings be moved to side with one party,
and not to be indifferent betwixt them, but it cannot be so intended of the
Court; wherefore let there be a new trial the next Term, and the Defendant
shall pay full Costs, and judgment to be upon this Verdict to stand for
security to pay what shall be recovered upon the next verdict. Granted.


The Protector and Buckner.
Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
BUckner was endicted upon the Statute of 1. Iac. Special verdict upon an
endictment upon the Statute of 1 Jac. against stabbing.
made against Stabbing at the Justice. Hall in the Old baily for killing of
Horwood, and upon the evidence given for the Protector, the Jury found a
special verdict, which was to this effect, viz. that Horwood and another man
with him came into the lodging of Buckner being. Drury Lane, and when they were
come into the lodging, that other man took down a sword in the Scabbard which
hung there, and stood at the Door of the Chamber with this Sword undrawn in his
hand, and kept the Door to keep Buckner from going out till they might bring a
Bailif to arrest Buckner for a debt which he owed Horwood, whereupon upon some
discourse between Buckner and Horwood, Buckner takes a Dagger out of his
pocket, and stabs Horwood and kills him, and whether this was within the
Statute of Stabbing was doubted by the Jury. Upon which Buckner was committed
to Newgate, and after the Body and the Cause was removed into this Court by a
Habeas Corpus and a Certiorari, and argued diverse times at the Bar and at last
on the Bench; and first Arthur Harris of Lincolns Inn opened the Record, and
only put the question, and then on the behalf of the Prisoner it was moved,
that he might have a Copy of the Record, and Council assigned him such as he
desired, which the Court granted, then it was prayed he might be bayled, but
that the Court would not grant, but turned him over to the Marescall, and gave
day for the Protectors council to be heard; At which day Twisden for the
Protector made this question, whether Buckner was to have his Clergy in this
case, or were debarred by the Statute or not, and he said, this question should
not have been made by the Jury as they have done upon the special Verdict, but
the Court ought to have made it, for the Jury are only to proceed upon matter
of fact, and not upon matter in Law, and he argued, that he ought not to have
his Clergy, for the Statute of 1 Iac. does not create the offense, but leaves
it to the Common law, and only takes away the Clergy from the party that
commits it, and to prove this, 1. It is not within the words of the Statute,
and 2ly, it is not within the meaning of the Statute, neither in its preamble,
nor in the body, or in the provis^ thereof, for Buckner was not first struck,
nor had he a weapon drawn against him, although he was kept a prisoner in his
Chamber, which was not a considerable but a slight provocation of him to move
him to so fowl a fact. And within the body of the Act, there are no Acts
expressed, but having a weapon drawn against him, or being first struck, and
this enumeration of the Acts excludes all other, as it is in the Statute of
Fines, and in the Statute which takes away Clergy. Also the reason of Law
requires to allow the Clergy to one that is first stricken: but here is no such
reason, and the party might have had his remedy against Horwood for coming
into his Chamber and imprisoning of him by an Action of Trespass; And the
having a weapon drawn was a reason for the other to defend himself. Finch
Henage for the Prisoner argued, that the Prisoner was only guilty of felony at
the Common Law and is not within the Statute by which his Clergy should be
taken away. For first the Statute is to be liberally interpreted,
Interpretation.
because it is made in restraint of the Common Law, and it was made only to
prevent fewds betwixt the English and the Scottish. Nation, which were then apt
to break forth, and the quarrel here was not a drunken and sudden quarrel, but
acted upon deliberation, and here is an Assault so great used against the
prisoner, that it amounts to a striking of him, 43 E. 3. f. 41. 42 E. 3. f. 7.
and the imprisonment of him is more than an assault, and here is found a
forcible entry into his Chamber, and the sending for a Bailif, and the standing
at his Chamber door with a sword in the parties hand, though not drawn, which
is as much in effect as if it had been drawn, and 23 Car. the Clergy was
allowed to two persons that aided and assisted a third person in stabbing of a
fourth man, Intendment.
and that because the Clergy shall not be taken away by intendments. Glyn chief
Justice. The Statute has not been so favorably construed as has been argued,
for here is no stroke, nor weapon drawn for his present defense, as the Statute
intends; and stabbing with a Tobacco pipe, and with a Hal^^^ has been adjudged
to be stabbing within the Statute, and the Statute does not say being first
assaulted, as this case is, but first stricken, and I conceive not that there
are any words in the Statute that will keep you out of it. Day was given over
to the next Term. At which day the special verdict was again repeated by
Sergeant Maynard, and by him it was argued for the prisoner, that he was not
within the Statute of 1 Iac. of stabbing, because first here was an unlawful
imprisoning of Buckner in his own Chamber, and this could not be without an
assault, next this Statute is not to be literally interpreted, for if there be
Acts of terror used against on^, although a weapon be not drawn, yet he is not
within the Statute although he kill another, for the taking up of a Candlestick
to strike another has been adjudged a weapon drawn, and he cited Patye and
Horwoods case, and all the persons that came into his Chamber were Trespassors,
and one of them taking the sword in his hand how could it be known what
mischief might have been done with it, Cooks case 14 Caroli, One may do a
lawful act by unlawful means, and although Buckner did ill yet is he not
within the Statute. Arthur Harris on the other side argued that the act was
stabbing within the Statute, and ousted the prisoner of his Clergy, and that he
is within the meaning and words of the Statute. The Statute intended to prevent
the killing of men suddenly, which is the worst of all other killing, for it is
as it were to destroy not only the body, but even to kill body and soul also,
and therefore though the Statute be penal, yet it is not to be favorably
interpreted, it being made for the peace and quiet of the Nation. The killing
is the matter aimed at in the Statute, and it matters not whether the party be
killed with a Fancheon or a Pistol, as Williams case was, that killed another
by throwing a Tailors Goose at him, and he is not within the saving of the
Statute though he was assaulted, and the other stood with the sword in the
scabbard in his hand, 36, 37 Eliz. Hanger and Molins case in the Exchequer
Chamber, The words of the Statute are, not being first struck, but an assault
is not a striking, and so he is out of the Letter of the Statute, and here was
no weapon drawn, for the sword was in the scabbard, which is no more than a
staff in a man's hand, Stat. 5 E. 6. C. 4. and it is like to a Pistol uncockt,
and if the sword had been drawn it would not have altered the case, because it
was not in Horwoods hand, who was slain, but in another, and you cannot extend
the Statute further. Glyn chief Justice, Will you have it argued any more?
Finch, No. Glyn chief Justice, I have considered of the Verdict, and consulted
with the Statute, and advised with all the Judges, and they are of mine
opinion. This is a good Law, and to be interpreted strictly, yet I hold the
prisoner is not within it; for the scope of the Statute appears by the
preamble, the body, and saving of it, which do all confirm my opinion: My first
reason is, because I find that the intent of the Statute is against sudden
killing, but here was nor a sudden killing, and the Statute takes not away the
Clergy from all manner of Manslaughter, and here was a Trespass and an
imprisnoment acted against the prisoner before he killed Horwood, and so the
act was not suddenly done. 2ly. The body of the act seems to mean, that there
ought to be malice in the case, and it does not intend we should stick to the
very words of it; and here the party slain might have forseen the danger, and
defended himself. 3ly The proviso excepts diverse particulars out of the Law,
and the word killing is only in the proviso, so that there is provision made
how the Statute shall be interpreted, viz. That it must be sudden killing,
which is not so here, for there so provocations, and time intervenient betwixt
them and the stabbing, and the Verdict finds no praeconceived malice, and the
Statute extends to no other killing by the proviso. And if one be assaulted by
Thieves which have no sword drawn, and the party assaulted stabs one of the
Thieves, he is not within the intent of the Statute, although he be within the
words of it, or if one be assaulted in his house, and the Assaultor has no
weapon drawn, and one of the Assaultors be shot, yet the party assaulted is not
within the Statute, 15 Car. in Davy and Williams case it was adjudged by all
the Judges that he that killed another by throwing a Hammer at him was not
within the Statute, because there was a preceding provocation of him. And i^
two assault a third person, and one of them strike the third person, and the
third person kills the other that did not strike him, I do not conceive he is
within the Statute, for it is the assault of both, and shall also be adjudged
the striking of both. Ask Justice held he was within the Statute, because it
was not unlawful to come to arrest him, and here was no weapon drawn, and so
it was adjourned to another day. At which day Buckner was again brought to the
Bar, Ask Justice repents the special verdict, and made the question whether
this fact of Buckner be within the Statute of 1 Iac. enacted against stabbing,
and he argued that it was, and that Buckner could not have his Clergy, because
the Statute shall be taken beneficially for the Commonwealth, and not for the
prisoner, who is a particular person, and the intent of the Statute is to take
away the Clergy for some felony; Neither by the common Law, nor by the Law of
God is there Clergy given for killing a man, and it was the Popish power that
introduced the Clergy to be given for Manslaughter, and also for murder, in
diminution of the Common Law, and of regal power, yea, and of the Law of God
also, and if a woman kill one she shall not have her Clergy, but be hanged,
which shows that by the Common Law the Clergy was not given for Manslaughter.
And by the Law of God I find no difference between Murder and Manslaughter,
for it makes no difference between hot blood and cold blood, as we do now
distinguish; and every word in the Statute me thinks does take away the Clergy
by way of argument, even from the title of the Act to the very end of it, and
here is a great sin to be punished, and great inconveniences would follow to
admit of the Clergy in such cases as this is, and here was a sudden killing as
the act expresses, for it was done with a dagger which was not seen, but
suddenly drawn out of a pocket, and no weapon was drawn against him, for the
provocations alleged, they cannot amount to the drawing of a weapon, or such a
provocation as the Statute intends, for all the acts done by Horwood amounted
but to a Trespass, and cannot be such a provocation as should cause Buckner to
fear his death, for no violence was used to his person by striking, or drawing
of a weapon, or other ways, and the sending for Bailifs to arrest him cannot be
such a provocation as the Statute intends, which is to put the party in fear of
his life, and the party knew that Horwood came with an intent only to arrest
him, and not to kill him, nor did the party slain do any thing against Buckner
to provoke him; and there is by presumption of Law a prepensed malice in
Buckner to kill Horwood, which is seen by his sudden manner of stabbing him,
and Davye and Williams case urged on the other side is not like to this case. I
grant if one kill a Thief suddenly it is not within the Statute, for such
killing was never intended to be prevented by it. The worst words one man can
give another are not a sufficient provocation within the Statute, for speaking
of words does much differ from drawing of a weapon: Nor is this a killing se
defendendo, or by misfortune, but a killing at the Common Law, and so the
Clergy is taken away by the Statute, and those of Sergeants Inn in
Fleetstreet, amongst whom are Barkly and Foster, and Roll, who have been
Judges, are of my opinion. Glyn chief Justice held it not within the Statute,
he argued long much to the effect as formerly, but having taken cold I could
not distinctly hear him, Adjourned. This Case was again argued Trin. 1656. to
enform Justice Warburton who was called to that Bench, after the former
arguments and opinion of the Court delivered much to the same manner as
formerly, By Finch for the prisoner, and Baldwin for the Protector, and
thereupon my Lord chief Justice Glyn, and Justice Warburton were of opinion
against Justice A^k, and so judgment was given for the prisoner, that the
stabbing was not within the Statute, but was only felony at the Common Law, and
the prisoner was admitted to his Clergy, and burnt in the hand accordingly.

Morden and Heart.
Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
MOrden brought an Action of debt upon an Obligation to stand to an Award
against Heart. Upon nil debet pleaded, Arrest of judgment in debt upon an
Obligation to stand to an Award.
and a verdict for the Plaintiff, it was moved in Arrest of judgment, and the
exception taken was, that the Award was made but of one part, and so not
binding to all the parties submitting. The case was this, One Stephens and Body
on one part, also Heart on the other part submitted to stand to the Award. The
Arbitrators awarded that Body should pay a certain sum of money unto Heart in
satisfaction for the differences betwixt Body and Stephens on the one part, and
Heart on the other part, which was objected could not be good, for the money
paid by one could not be in satisfaction for another, and so the Award is not
made to conclude all the parties submitting, for Stephens was not concerned in
it, and the Award is with an Ita quod, which ought to be a general Award, and
include all parties, and therefore if it be void in part it is void in all. But
Green on the other side answered, though the Award should be naught in part,
yet it may be good as to Body that paid the money, and the moneys ought to be
received as they are paid, and that is for Body and Stephens, and may be well
in satisfaction for both of them. It was also urged by Howell on the same side,
that it appears that Body and Stephens are partners, and this will make an end
of the matter, for then the money paid by one of them may satisfy for the
other. Award in part.
Glyn chief Justice, Here is a good Award between two of the parties that
submitted, but there appears nothing to be awarded as to Stephens, the third
party, for it does not appear that he can take any benefit by the Award of the
money to be paid by Body, or that it can be any satisfaction for him, but only
for Body. Judgment for the Defendant.

Busfield and Norden.
Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
A Writ of Error was brought by Busfield against Nordon to reverse a judgment
given in the Court Military of Rippon in an action upon an indebitatus
assumpsit for wares sold, Error to reverse a judgment upon an indebitatus
assumpsit by the Bail.
wherein there being a judgment given against the principal, a scire facias
issued out against the Ball, and a judgment was thereupon and against him, the
bail thereupon brings a writ of Error to reverse both these judgments, and
assigns for Error, that there was no issue joined in the first judgment, and
that being erroneous, Bail cannot reverse the principal judgment. The writ
abaed.
and being the ground upon which the scire facias did issue forth, whereupon
the second judgment was given, the second judgment cannot be good. Glyn chief
Justice, But the principal judgment ought to be reversed by the principal, and
not by the bail, and therefore the writ of Error is not well brought by the
bail, therefore let it abate.

Vidian and Fletcher.
Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
Upon view of an Infant brought into Court of to be inspected, Scire facias for

who had during coverture joined with her husband in levying a fine of her
lands she was by the Court adjudged within age, whereupon a scire facias issued
out to the Terr-tenants who came in and pleaded that she was of full age at the
time of the fine levied, upon which plea issue was joined, and a trial was had
at the Assizes, and a Verdict for the Plaintiff, who now came in Court and
prayed for judgment upon the Verdict. Glyn chief Justice; The Court is to
judge of the Infancy, Jury not to try Infancy.
and not the Jury, and therefore you have not proceeded duly, but the
proceedings do no hurt, for we judge she was within age, Fine reversed.
Therefore let the fine be reversed, nisi, etc. Nota.

and the hundred of Crondon.
Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
AN Action of Trespass upon the case was brought against the Hundred of Crondon
in Hampshire upon the Stat. of Winchester, Arrest of Judgment in an Action
upon the Statute of Huc and C^yes. Case. Statute.
by one that was robbed within the hundred, and upon the trial a verdict passed
for the Plaintiff, It was moved on the behalf of the Hundred in Arrest of
judgment, 1. That the Plaintiff had mistaken his Action, for whereas he has
brought a general Action of Trespass upon the case, he ought to have brought an
Action upon the Statute. 2ly. He declares that he took his Oath before I. S. a
Justice of Peace in the County, Whereas it should be for the County. 3ly. He
has not expressed that he took his Oath before a Justice assigned to keep the
Peace. 4ly. There is no issue joined. 5ly. He says that he took his Oath 20
days. but does not say next before, as the Statute directs. Windham on the
other side answered to the first Exception, that it is usual of latter times to
declare in an Action upon the Case generally. To the second he said it is no
exception, for a Justice of Peace is not an Officer aff^red to a place.
Sergeant Twisden, But it does not appear that you took your Oath 20 days before
your Original sued out. Glyn chief Justice, That appears well enough upon the
Record. Variation.
But the writ here is in an Action upon the case generally, and yet he declares
in an Action upon the case upon the Statute, which is not all one, and so the
Declaration varies from the writ, for an Action upon the Case upon the Statute
is an extraordinary Action upon the case, Recital judgment.
but I believe it is well enough, notwithanding, it being after a Verdict, and
not being a material variance, but a bare recital, Therefore let the Plantif
take his judgment.

Conye and Laws.
Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
Hill. 1655. rot. 251.
Laws brought an Action upon the case against Conye upon an indebitatus
assumpsit upon an account, Error to reverse a judgment in an Action upon a
promise
the Defendant pleaded non assumpsit, and upon issue joined, a special verdict
was found for the Plaintiff, and a judgment given for him, upon the special
verdict the case appeared to be this, the Plaintiff Laws married a Feme unto whom
moneys were owing dum sola fuit, and the Baron, and the Debtor come to an
account for the money, the Debtor being found in arrere promises the Baron to
pay him the money due upon the account at a certain day, and for not performing
this promise the Plaintiff brought his Action. Upon the writ of error brought it
was urged, that the Plaintiff did not show how the moneys became due to the
wife, and that the account did not alter the Case, and Hernden and Palmers
case, Hob. 88. was cited to be like this case, and Done and Thorns case, 24.
Car. in this Court was also cited, and 20 H. 6. f. 20. b. Wild on the other
side said, that the Declaration is true, and the verdict contradicts it not,
for by the marriage the debt is due to the Husband, and therefore he ought to
bring the Action, and the case differs from Hobarts case. Glyn chief Justice,
Hobarts case is not like this, it is true the account alters not the nature of
the Action, but here the verdict finds that there was a special promise made to
pay the moneys to the Husband, Special promise.
and there may be an actual promise in an insimul computaverunt, although the
law does create a promise where a special promise is not showed, and here is a
distinct day for payment of the money alleged, and the consideration is good,
Consideration Release.
for it is a debt due to the Husband, and he may release it, and the doubt made
by the Jury is, whether the Action be well brought by the Husband alone or not.
At another day Green urged, that here does not appear a consideration for the
special promise, Promise in law.
and then it can be taken but for a promise in Law, and upon such a promise the
Action cannot lie, for the debt is due to the wife notwithstanding the marriage,
Wild answered, the account is good to the Baron to ground the promise upon, and
he cited Partridges Case, and the promise here to pay the money at a day is a
special promise and not created by the Law, and this makes the consideration
good, and the Declaration is true, for it is the Husbands debt, and the verdict
confirm it, and if the wife die the administration belongs to the Husband,
which proves it is his debt, and the writ of error is not good, and so the
Record is not removed, the writ of error is directed to the Mayor and Sherifs
of Lincoln, and the Court is said to be held before the Sherifs only. Glyn
chief Justice, Debt changed.
The nature of the debt is not changed by the account, no more than the
accompting with an Executor, but a special promise may alter the debt: Here is
a promise made to the Husband, and he has brought the Action as if the
Defendant were indebted to him, yet he is not indebted to him generally, but
sub modo, viz. jure uxoris. There is another point in the Case, I conceive here
is cause of Action, but whether it be applicable to make it a special debt is
the question. Writ of Error quashed.
But the writ of error is naught, therefore let it be quashed.

Arnold and Floyd.
Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
ARnold a Bruer brought an Action of Debt upon a Bond to perform Articles
against Floyd his Clark. Arrest of judgment in debt upon an Obligation to
perform articles.
The effect of one of the Articles was, that the Defendant should deliver
weekly such Ale and Beer as should be delivered unto him to such Customers as
he had in his charge, and to receive the moneys of such Customers as were due
for the same, and the excise, and should account every Saturday weekly unto the
Plaintiff for such moneys as he should receive for the same, for breach of
Covenant the Plaintiff assigns that the Defendant did not account with him for
such moneys as he had received upon Saturday the 26th. of July 1654. and for
this he brings his Action. Upon issue joined, and a verdict found for the
Plaintiff, it was moved in arrest of judgment, that the breach was uncertainly
alleged, because the Plaintiff does not show, that the Defendant had any
Customers in his charge, or who they were, or that he had delivered Ale or Beer
to them, or received any money of them. Glyn chief Justice, The charge is too
generally set forth, Uncertain charges.
for you ought to have showed what moneys he has received, and that it was of
those Customers in his charge, for the Plaintiff may have several Clarks, and
some Customers may be in the charge of one Clark, and some in the charge of an
other, Judgment Nil capiat per billam.
so that the charge is not certain. Therefore let Nil capiat per billam be
entered for the Defendant.

Toft and Day.
Mich. 1655. Upper Bench.
AN Action of Debt was brought in the Common Pleas, Error to reverse a
judgment In an action upon the Case for making a false retorn of a Writ.
and a judgment given for the Plaintiff, who thereupon takes out execution,
viz. a Fieri facias, and delivers it to the Sherifs of Norwitch, who executed
it by levying the debt upon the goods and chattels of the Defendant, after
which the Sherifs were discharged their Office, and new Sherifs elected in
their places. Whereupon the old Sherifs redelivered to the party the deeds
taken in execution, by virtue of the Fieri facias, and endorsed nulla bona upon
the writ of Fieri facias, and delivered it so endorsed unto the new Sherifs,
and for making of this retorn an Action upon the Case was brought in the
Common Pleas against the two old Sherifs, and a judgment obtained against
them; whereupon a writ of error was here brought to reverse this judgment, and
these exceptions were taken, 1. That the Plaintiff in his Declaration in his
Action upon the Case does not say, that the old Sherifs did retorn nulla bona,
Retorn.
but only that they did endorse nulla bona upon the writ, which is not a
retorn, and so the Action cannot lie for a false retorn. 2ly. He says that the
old Sherifs delivered the writ thus endorsed to the new, but does not say that
they did deliver it to be returned, viz. by Indenture, Indenture.
as the use is. 3ly. It does not appear whether there were any retorn of the
writ made either by the old Sherifs or the new. 4ly. The Action is brought in a
wrong County, Venue.
for it is not brought in the County where the endorsement and delivery over of
the writ was. Latch of council on the other side answered, that the Action was
brought for delivering the goods back again to the Defendant after they had
taken them by virtue of a Fieri facias, and not for the endorsement made upon
the writ. The rule was to reverse the judgment, except cause showed to the
contrary. At another day the Court was moved to affirm the judgment, and the
council on the other side insisted upon the former exceptions to reverse the
judgment. Glyn chief Justice caused the Record to be read, and upon Oyer
thereof said, I conceive it is well, and according to the course in that kind,
for the old Sherifs to make the retorn, and to deliver the writ over by
Indenture to the new Sherifs, and here is also a verdict in the Case, and a
retorn is not properly a retorn until it be filed here, yet it is the retorn
of the Sherif in the County where he is Sherif. Show cause upon notice why the
judgment ought not to be reversed. Antea. Q.

Denton.
Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
AN order of the public Sessions made against one Denton for the keeping of a
Bastard child was removed into this Court by a Certiorari, To quash a retorn of
an order of Sessions.
and the party also who was committed to Ailsbury gaol for disobeying the
order, was brought into Court upon a Habeas Corpus granted unto him, and upon
the reading of the retorn of the Habeas Corpus, this exception was taken to the
retorn, that it appears by the retorn that the order made for Denton to keep
the Bastard-child was made by the Justices at the Quarter Sessions, and that
for not obeying this order he was committed to the Gaol by two Justices at a
private Sessions of the peace, whereas the Justices of the Quarter Sessions had
no authority by the Statute to make such an order, for it ought to have been
made by the next two Justices of peace to the place where the Bastard was born.
And to this Glyn chief Justice agreed, but would not release the Prisoner till
he was bound over with good bayl to the next Quarter Sessions for the County of
Buckingham, to appear there and to answer the fact.

stood to have special bayl for her, which she could not procure, and therefore
it was prayed, that she might be delivered upon common bayl. But Glyn chief
Justice answered, Denied.
if there be cause to have special bayl the wife must lie in Prison, until the
Husband appear and put in bayl for her, for she cannot put in bayl for herself
being Covert Baron.

for the Plaintiff that in respect that the Defendant had put in a special plea,
and pleaded a very long Award, which made the plea very long, that therefore he
might have time granted unto him by the Court to demur to this plea. But Glyn
chief Justice answered, you need not have time to demur to the Plea, for you
may do that presently: Denied. Rejoinder.
but if you desire time to rejoyn in respect of the length of the Ples, you
shall have it.

Plummer and Sir John Lenthall.
Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
THe Plaintiff showed to the Court by his Council that he had brought an Action
of escape against Sir John Lenthall the Mareschall of the Marshalsea of this
Court, To put Sir John Lenthall out of his Office.
and had thereupon a judgment and an execution on against him, but that Sir
John though as being Marshall he ought as an Officer of this Court daily to
attend the Court, did yet nevertheless absent himself, so that the Plaintiff
could not take him upon the execution, and that if he were present he doubted,
whether he might take him, for fear it would be an escape of the Prisoners
committed to him, and therefore prayed that Sir John Lenthall might be put out
of his place of Marescall, that so he might take him in execution. Glyn chief
Justice, This is very mischievous, Cause.
let Sir John show cause Friday next why he should not pay the moneys.

IN a writ of Error brought in this Court to reverse a judgment given in an
Action of debt The Defendants Council in the writ of Error moved, To reverse a
judgment for expedition.
that the Court would reverse the judgment because they conceived it was

chief Justice, You have not yet confessed the error upon the Record, neither
have you pleaded in nullo est erratum, as you ought to do, Denied for moving o^

and therefore you move too soon to have the Judgment reversed.

Hamond and Thornhill.
Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
IN the Case of one Hamond and Thornhill in a trespass and ejectment tried at
the Bar, Whether Gavelkind-lands held by chivalry he deviseable.
upon the evidence given it was affirmed by Sergeant Twisden, that
Gavelkind-lands though they be held by Knight Service tenure, might be all
devised by Will by the custom of Kent. Q. for other Council doubted of it.

Arnold and Floyd.
Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
THis Case formerly spoken unto, and after a Nil capiat per billam, nisi, etc.
ordere^ to be entered against the Plaintiff was again spoken unto, and the Case
put, and the exception formerly taken that the Plaintiff had declared of a
general receiving of money of such and such Customers, and had not accounted for
them, whereas the Articles for breach of which the Action is brought do express
that he should account for such moneys as he should receive of the Customers,
which were in his charge only. But Green answered, that though it was not so
expressed, yet it should be intended that he had not accounted for all such
moneys as he had received of the Customers in his charge, and as to another
exception which was also formerly taken, viz. that the Plaintiff had not showed
what moneys he had received, for which the Defendant had not accounted, and so
he knew not what answer to give, Green answered, that the Plaintiff is not bound
to show it precisely, for he cannot tell what the Defendant had received, and
what not, but the Defendant does know it well enough. Glyn chief Justice, I
doubt of that, for the Plaintiff must know that the Defendant has received some
moneys which he has not accounted for, otherwise there is no cause of Action,
and though it be not necessary for you to show all the particular sums the
Defendant has received and not accounted for, yet you must express some sum
with which to charge him withal, and therefore as to this exception, I think
it material, and the Declaration is too general to charge the Defendant by, for
what issue can be joined upon this? for here does not appear to be any breath
of the Articles, but only by implication that he has received some moneys
unaccounted for, and an issue cannot be tried upon a presumption. Issue.
Presumption.
Green prayed leave to discontinue the Action But Wild on the other side said
it ought not to be, because the Action is brought against a Surety only that
was bound for the Defendant that he should perform Articles. Glyn chief
Justice, If he do discontinue the Action, Discontinuance.
he has no further remedy against the Defendant. But show cause why he should
not appear upon the Articles, and to pay so much as it shall be found that he
is dampnified by breach of them, and then he shall discontinue.

that the Plaintiff had brought his Action for 14 l. and he declares of a Debt

come but to twelve pound. Glyn chief Justice, I conceive it is not good for the
variance, and therefore let the Judgment be reversed, Variance. Reversed.

The Protector and the Town of Kingston upon Thames.
Yates his Case and others.
Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
YAtes and four or five other persons, Upon the retorn of a writ of Restitution
to Freement places in Kingston upon Thames.
Freemen of the Town of Kingston upon Thames, being disfranchised by the
Baylifs, etc. of that Corporation, moved for a writ of restitution to be
restored to their freedoms and places in that Town, and had it granted, which
writ was accordingly directed to the Bailifs, etc. of that Corporation, who
thereupon do make retorn of the writ, and therein set forth at large there
Charter and privileges of the Town, and the cause of the disfranchisement of
Yates and the others, and reasons why they were not to be restored. And by the
retorn the matter of fact for which they were disfranchised appeared to be in
substance this, viz. that there was a difference amongst those of the
Corporation about making an Attorney of their Court, at a Court held for the
Town, that there was like to be a tumult and uproar about this matter;
whereupon the Baylifs that held the Court did adjourn the Court, and commanded
all persons there to depart, and then they with the rest that were of their
party went away. But the other parties on the contrary side, whereof Yates and
the rest that were disfranchised were a part stayed still in the Town Hall, and
said, the Court was not dissolved, and did affirm they were a Court, and did
thereupon make diverse orders or acts of Court, and caused them to be entered in
the Court book where all the orders used to be entered To this retorn many
exceptions were taken, and first by Sergeant Twisden, 1. That here was no
sufficient matter of fact returned to be done by Yates and the others, to cause
them to be disfranchised. 2ly. That the retorn did not show, that the Customs
of their Corporation did warrant them to disfranchise any for such offenses, or
did show that any person had at any time been disfranchised for such offenses,
3ly. The retorn mentions that the persons disfranchised had broken their oaths
as Freemen of the Town, but does not set forth this oath at large as it ought
to be. 4ly. They do not show in the retorn that they had any authority to hold
that Court which they dissolved, nor before whom it was held. 5ly. It is not
showed in the retorn that Yates and the others were at all convented to answer
their offenses, and so they are condemned without hearing of them, which is
illegal. To these exceptions Green of Council to maintain the retorn made this
answer, for the first he said, there does appear a sufficient fact to be done
by Yates and the rest to cause them to be disfranchised, viz. their tumultuous
going into the Court, and staying there after it was dissolved, and making of
orders, and entering them into the Book, and cited Sir James Bags case, that
this their fact was a corrupting the orders of the Town. For the second the
retorn does sufficiently express, that by their Customs they may remove persons
from their places in the Corporation for such offenses, for the retorn says,
Removeable.
that persons have been from time to time removeable, which is all one as if it
had said, they have been removed. 3ly. It is not necessary to set forth the
whole oath of a Freeman, and here is as much of the oath mentioned as is
needful to show that the oath was broken by them. 4ly. It is showed in the
retorn, that the Court was held according to their Customs, and so it shall be
intended to be a good Court, and rightly held, and it needs not to be expressed
before whom it was held. 5ly. It is expressed that they were convented, and
that they had also notice of the dissolution of the Court. Mr. Attorney General
on the same side said, Here is cause to disfranchise the parties; for here
appears by their fact to be a setting up of government against government,
Opposition of government.
and this is corrupting of government, and done by knowing persons that well
understand the Custom of the Town, which makes their crimes the greater, and
it is better returned, that such persons are removeable, than to say they have
been removed, and here is more than an opinion of one of the parties against
the opinon of the others, for they have reduced their opinion into an Act to
disturb the government. Mr. Recorder of London on the same side said, that here
is a fact done to eradicate the whole government of the Town, for doing whereof
the parties justly deserve to be disfranchised, and their entering of orders
into the Register-book is a corrupting of the Customs of the Town, and tends to
the subversion of the Corporation, and he cited 28 H. S. Maleverers case in
Dyer. Alleyn on the same side, Here is sufficient cause showed in the retorn to
turn the parties out of their offices, unto which they pray to be restored if
there should not appear sufficient matter to disfranchise them. Roll who when
this case was first moved was chief Justice said, here is one Groves that prays
to be restored, concerning whom the retorn shows no cause at all why he was
removed, No cause of disfranchisement.
but only that he was endicted of Felony, which is not a sufficient cause, for
he may be endicted falsely, and it does not appear that any thing has been as
yet done upon the: Endictment, and yet they allege this for cause why they will
not restore him, and if you have no cause to remove him, then he is unjustly
removed, and ought to be restored, and this cause you have showed, such as it
is, was after that he was removed, and so could be no cause of his removal. But
for the rest there is no question but that here is a high contempt, and just
cause to disfranchise the parties, for here is more than an opinion, as has
been urged for them, for there is an Act of a high nature tending to evert all
government in hindering the proceedings of Justice, and the profit and welfare
of the Town, and a greater offense of this nature cannot be imagined, and
therefore for the matter there is cause to disfranchise them. But the question
is, whether the retorn be good, and as to that I conceive it not necessary to
set forth the whole Oath, or to aver the swearing of the Attorney. But the
retorn ought to have been, that by their Custom they have used to remove
persons for such offenses, Have used to remove.
and not to say they are removeable, and of this I doubt and will advise. At
another day Latch of Council for Yates urged that the retorn was not good, for
they have not shown any Act done to remove any person for misdemeanors,
according to the custom, as they have alleged it; for the return says only that
such parties have been removable, and this is only a possibility of an act, and
it appears not how they are removable, Possibility of an Act.
either by their Custom, or by their Charter, and consequently here is no
ground for their removal returned, Pasch. 33 Eliz. C. B. a potential Custom
returned is not good, Potential custom not good.
possit and potuislet adjudged not good in Sir William Hattons case, and 21
Iac. usus fuit held naught. And as to the Objection that it is not necessary to
return their power to remove, because it is a thing incident unto their
Corporation, I answer they have returned a power, but have not made it good by
the return. Mag Chart. 25. and to the Objection that a return needs not to be
so formal as a pleading, and that therefore if their power do appear upon the
whole return it is good enough, I answer, that they have failed in the very
matter of their prescription, and not in the form only, and they must certify
a good cause of their removal, that the Court may judge of it; and as to that
which is objected, that their Charter is a very ancient Charter, and therefore
cannot be pleaded, I answer, Charter pleaded and not given in evidence.
that they may give it in evidence, and also a Charter made time out of mind
may be pleaded as an old deed may, although you cannot plead that it was made
time out of mind. Sergeant Twisden on the same side, All customs ought to be
alleged in facto, 9 Car. Fletcher and Bagnals case, Licitum fuit for a Londoner
to use any trade by the custom of London adjudged to be ill pleaded, and though
it may be good in an evidence, yet it is not good in a return. Alleyn on the
other side said, that the return is good in the returning of the custom, though
it would have been ill in the pleading, Pleading. Retorn.
which is stricter than a return need to be, and here is matter enough returned
to remove the parties, and the whole customs need not to be returned, and the
informality of the return shall not make it ill, for this Court is to judge of
the matter of fact returned, and so is Giles Bags and Wagoners case, and they
have returned a custom to remove, and by consequence some have been removed, or
else the return is false, which is not to be presumed. Windham, Every custom is
presumed by the Law to have a lawful beginning, and shall be intended many
times to be by ancient Charter, namely, for such things as are not to be
claimed without a Charter, but if they may be claimed without a Charter it
shall be intended otherwise. Ancient Charter.
An ancient Charter does not lose its force by not being confirmed in Air, as
Latch has said, 24 H. 6. and there may be a prescription for things which have
never been acted, if it began by Charter, 22 E. 4. f. 9. Green on the same side
The very words of the retorn do enforce that persons have been removed. Glyn
chief Justice, I have no books delivered me in this case; And this Exception
was moved the last Term, and it is very doubtful to me, and my Lord Roll would
not deliver his opinion, I could wish the business might be composed for the
peace of the Corporation. To say that the lands have been demised and
demisable, the words shall be taken distributive. But me seems here is no
matter of fact returned for removing of any. At another day the case was spoken
to again, and against the return it was excepted as formerly, Prescription in
fieri.
that the Town had not by the return entitled themselves to any power to remove
the parties, for here is a prescription only in fieri and not in facto
returned, viz. That such persons have been accustomed to be removable, and it
does not say they have been removed, and these cases, viz, 20 E. 4. and Mich. 7
Car. Flower, case, and Mich. 9 Car. Fletcher and Bagshaws case, and Skipwiths
case, 25 Eliz. C. B. were cited by Wild on Council for Yates. Windham on the
other side as formerly distinguished betwixt a pleading, and a return, which
needs not be so formal as a pleading, but shall be taken good to a common
intent, and said that Wagoners case, which was as this is, was adjudged to be
well upon good advice, and the substance of the prescription is well set forth
in the return, and the formality is not to be much stood upon, Substance.
or regarded. Alleyn on the same side said, that the rule in Wagoners case
comes home to this. Glyn chief Justice, There is an Action upon the case
brought by Yates for this matter, and if it be found for him we will restore
him, be the return as it will. Custom is the main hinge upon which all
disfranchisements do move, and if that be not well alleged, it will be hard for
the disfranchisement. Try your cause this Term, otherwise we will deliver our
opinions upon the return. At another bay the Court was moved for their opinion
upon the return, by Yates his Council, whether it was good or not. Whereupon
Glyn chief Just. answered, It were good you would agree as the Court has
advised; But since you will not we will give our judgment, for the cause has
depended long. And first I conceive that here is good cause to disfranchise the
parties for entering of orders made by a pretended Court, Cause of
disfranchisement.
which in truth was no Court, for their entry of such orders is very
prejudicial to the corporation, and is to the ill example of others, to disturb
the government. But Custom is the main cause of disfranchising any person, for
by the disfranchisement the party loses his freehold, which is no small loss,
and therefore not to be put in practice but upon very good warrant; and yet in
some cases for the advancement of government one may be put out of his freehold
without a legal proceeding against the party, as Sir James Bags case is. But
there must be a Custom or a Statute to warrant it. But here appears no such
Custom upon the return, for the return is that for such offenses the parties
have used to be removable and dischargeable, which is merely imaginary, and a
thing in fieri, Thing in fieri not in facto.
and not in facto, or in usage, and so it is as a dead thing in the womb which
never had birth, for you have not showed that it was at any time put in
practice, or have made any direct affirmance of the Custom, as all Customs use
to be pleaded. All Customs imply two things, Possibility and use.
to wit, a thing possible to be done, and that the thing has sometimes been
done, and so are all our pleadings, and the return ought to have in it
certainty enough to inform the Court of the master returned, although it is not
required they should be so precise as pleadings ought to be, Return should be
certain.
for both the Court and the party must abide by the return, and it is to be
acknowledged as true. In Wagoners case cited, It was touched whether the Custom
there was well alleged, and concerning the Customs of London also, which do
differ from other customs, they being confirmed by Statute, and there they
allege a special act of Common Council by Custom, and a Statute also to enable
them to do as they did. I have considered well of the return, and I hold the
return to be naught, Ill return.
and therefore let him be restored. Ask Justice concurred in opinion. The Court
was moved to restore the rest, who were 4 in number, because all their cases
were alike. Glyn chief Justice, Let them be restored also, nisi, etc. Restored.


London and Craven.
Trin. 1655. rot. 44.
LOndon and Craven entered into Articles by Indenture betwixt them, Arrest of
Judgment in an Action of Covenant for breach of Articles
wherein London did article to pay 110 l. at a certain day to come unto Craven,
and Craven did article that upon the receipt of the 110 l. unto him from
London, that he would give unto London an acquittance for the 110 l. and would
also enter into an Obligation of 400 l. unto London to save him harmless from
all claims which should be made unto certain lands in the possession of the
said London, in pursuance of these Articles London does tender the 110 l. unto
Craven at the day limited in the Articles, but Craven refuses to receive the
110 l. of London, and to give him an acquittance, and also to enter into the
bond of 400 l. Whereupon London brings an Action of Covenant against Craven for
breach of the Articles, and assigns the breach to be, that he did not give him
an acquittance for the 110 l. nor enter into the bond of 400 l. according to
the Articles, and upon issue joined a verdict was found for the Plaintiff. It
was moved by the Defendant in Arrest of Judgment, That here is no breach of
Covenant showed by the Plaintiff, for the Declaration is that the Defendant upon
the payment of the 110 l. was to give the acquittance, and enter into the bond
of 400 l. and here is no payment but only a tender and a refusal of the 110 l.
mentioned, and it was in the Defendants election, either to refuse the 110 l.
and to give no acquittance, nor enter into the bond of 400 l. or else to
receive it, and give the acquittance, and enter into the bond, and so his
refusal is no breach of Covenant. On the other side it was urged that it was
not in the Defendants Election to receive the 110 l. or to refuse it, but he
was bound by the Articles to receive the 110 l. and to give the acquittance,
and enter into the bond of 400 l. Glyn chief Justice, Here is a Covenant
grounded upon Articles indented, and it is the mutual Covenant of both the
parties, so that he is bound by the Articles to receive the 110 l. at the day
limited, and it is not in his power either to receive it, or to refuse it, as
has been objected, and the Defendant had remedy by the Articles to recover the
110 l. Mutual Covenant.
if it had not been paid at the day, and therefore he is bound to receive it,
and to give an acquittance for it, and to enter into the bond of 400 l. and we
must make a reasonable construction of the words of the parties, But we will
advise. At another day the case was again put, and the opinion of the Court
desired, And Glyn chief Justice thereupon said, here is no breach of Covenant
alleged to ground the Action upon, for the Articles express, that upon the
receipt of the 110 l. the Defendant would give the acquittance, and enter into
bond, and the breach alleged is, that the Plaintiff tendered the 110 l. at the
day, and the Defendant refused to receive it, and has not sealed the
acquittance, nor given the bond of 400 l. and it may be it was the intent of
the parties, that it should be in the election of the Defendant either to
receive the 110 l. or not to receive it, and the Plaintiff is not prejudiced by
the Defendants not receiving of it; for if he should sue for the 110 l. the
Plaintiff may plead this tender and refusal against him, and that will be judged
a payment, and when he sues you for the 110 l. you may sue him for the
acquittance and the bond. Ask, I have not a book, but I think the case is as it
has been put, and here is no Covenant that the Defendant should receive the
110 l. at the day, Nil caplat per Billam.
Glyn chief Justice, Nil capiat per Billam, nisi, etc.

Clark and Fitzwilliams.
AN Action of Trover and Conversion was brought by Clark against Fitzwilliams
for diverse goods and household stuff, and amongst the rest the Plaintiff declared
of a Trover and Coversion of 6 Tuns. Arrest of Judgment in a Trover and
Coversion.
After a Verdict for the Plaintiff it was moved in Arrest of Judgment, that the
Declaration was uncertain, for it cannot be known what is meant by 6 Tuns, and
upon this the judgment was stayed till the Plaintiff should move. Whereupon
Sergeant Twisden at another day moved for judgment and said the Declaration
was good enough, for it is known that the 6 Tuns are Brewers Vessels, or else
they signify nothing, and then no damages are given for them, according to
Osborns case, and the case where the Action was pro viginti ulnis instead of
ulmis. Windham on the other side said, that a Tun is a measure, and well known
so to be, and you ought to show certainly of what you do demand the quantity
of six Tuns, and it cannot be said that the six Tuns shall signify nothing, as
Sergeant Twisden supposes, for here the words are substantive, and signify by
themselves, and not adjective, and Osborns case cited was adjudged upon another
reason; for fulcrum lecti signifies a Bedstead, and the Anglice which was
added, viz. Curtains and Valence were a mere addition, and no part of the
Declaration, and besides they were in English which ought not to have been.
Glyn chief Justice, The Court has delivered their opinion already, That it is
uncertain what the Plaintiff does mean by the words 6 Tuns, for this case is not
like the cases put, where a thing is mentioned, which does signify nothing,
for there damages cannot be given for such a thing, for the word Tun does
signify diverse things, but it is uncertain what it does signify here, Nil
capiat nisi.
and therefore Nil capiat per billam, Ask Justice ad idem.

Fox and Swann.
Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
IN a Trial at the Bar in a Trespass and Ejectment betwixt Fox Plaintiff and
Swann Defendant exception was taken against a witness that was produced to
prove the lease of ejectment, Exception against a w^^nesse.
because he had the inheritance in the lands let, but it was urged by the
Council on the Plaintifs side, that the Defendant did claim under the same
person that the Plaintiff did, and thereupon the witness was admitted to be
sworn, and in this case it was also said that if Lessee for years do covenant
with the Lessor not to assign over his Term without the Lessors consent in
writing, A Devise is not an assignment.
and do afterward without such consent devise the Term to J. S. this is not a
breach of the Covenant, for a devise is not a lease. It was also said, that if
a lease for years be forfeited, and the rent for the land let be afterward
received by the Lessor or by his assent, the lease is made good again by this
Act of the Lessor, Lease forfeited revived.
and the forfeiture is dispensed withal. Nota.

Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
Upon Articles exhibited in this Court against one Alwin an Attorney of this
Court for false practice and Barratry, Attorney convicted upon Articles, turned
over the Bar.
and proved against him by diverse Affidavits read in Court, Judgment was
pronounced against him by the Court, that he should be put out of the Roll of
the Attorneys, and be fined 50 l. and turned over the Bar, and stand committed.
He was turned over the Bar accordingly at the West end of the Bar by the
Tip-staffs of the Court.

Martyn and Miller.
Mich. 1655. Banc. sup.
THere were two several causes tried betwixt Martyn Plaintiff, Arrest of
Judgment upon an Error of a Clark.
and Miller Defendant, and thereupon there were two venires, and two
Distringasses taken out, and by the mistake of the Sherif a wrong Distringas
was filed to the Venire, viz. that which should have been filed to the Venire
in the first cause, was filed to the Venire in the second cause, and this was
moved in Arrest of Judgment. Glyn chief Justice, This is as if there was no
Distringas, and is therefore helped by the Statutes of Ieofails, but if it were
an erroneous Distringas it could not be helped, and here was a good issue
joined, and a good trial of that issue, and it was but the mistake of the
Sherif, and may be amended by taking off the wrong Distringas from the Venire,
and fixing the right Distringas in the room of it, No Rule.
and therefore this is no cause to arrest judgment.

To the Reader.
BE pleased to take notice that notwithstanding my more than ordinary care in
Correcting the Press, these ensuing Errataes have happened in the Prenting,
but many of them are but literal, and alter not the sense, and for the others I
hope you will pardon them, and correct them by the Errata as you meet with them.
