VIRGO TRIVMPHAN^ OR, VIRGINIA In General, but the South part thereof in
particular: Including the fertile CAROLANA, and the no less excellent Island
of ROANOAK, richly and experimentally valued.

Humbly presented as the Auspice of a beginning Year, To the Parliament of
ENGLAND, And Council of STATE.

By EDWARD WILLIAMS, Gent.

LONDON, Printed by THOMAS HARPER, for JOHN STEPHENSON, and are to be sold at
his Shop on Ludgate Hill, at the Sign of the Sun, 1650.

To the Supreme Authority of this Nation, The Parliament of ENGLAND.
Right Honorable:
THis Dedication in it self unworthy the honor of an address to your
Grandeurs, and of a foil too dead i^ ^h^ddow to approach near your most
vigorous luster, reposes it self yet upon a confidence that in imitation of
that God (of whom you are in power the proper Representatives) who vouchsafed
graciously to accept a p^ore pair of Turtles from those whose abilities could
not ascend t^ a more rich oblation, you will be pleased to cast a favorable
aspect upon this humble offering, as proceeding from a grateful clear and
sincere intention, whose desire being strong^y passionate to present Your
Hono^rs with something more worthy the auspice of a beginning Year, is
circumscribed by a narrowness of abilities and fortunes.

And indeed my lowness had prompted me to have found out a more humble Patron
for this Treatise; but since the Interest of that Nation you have so happily
restored to its just and native liberty is the principal aim intended in it,
since the public acknowledgement of the world unites in this common testimony,
That God has subscribed to all your Heroic and Christian undertakings with
his own broad seal of Victory^ with his own field word, Go on and prosper: led
you through the red sea of blood into the Land of Canaan, into the Harvest and
Vintage of Israel, since Pharaoh and his mighty ones have been swallowed up in
the rapid current in the hideous cataracts of their ambit^ous opposition; and
have by loud and convincing testimonies (testimonies attracting the admiration
of your friends, and confounding the malice of your enemies) made it a blessed
object of your consideration, that the preservation and fixure requires a
bl^ssing no less sublime, and a vert^e no less^ ex^l^^d, then the acquisiti^n
and tenure of conquests, m^de good in the (...) Christ^ndome by vindicating the
English Honor upon the British Ocean with a ^u^ssant Navy, a formidable
subject of ^^^^^ment to the Foreign Enemies of your Sion, by a strong winged
prosecution of the Irish Assassinates, a spacious lettred example to teach
English Mutineers what they may expect by the re^ sentence of justice upon
Irish Rebels: All endeavors holding forth the way to improve the interest of
this Nation, are improperly addressed to any other then your selves, who as you
have been the unexampled instruments of our unpinion^ liberty, ought to be the
sole Judges of whatsoever may relate to our future felicity.

We should have suspected the sincerity of History in its delineation of the
Majesty which sat upon that August, and venerable Roman Senats, after having
made the Land tremble under the terror of their Armies, the sea to labor
under the burden of their numerous Navies, after having delivered all power
oppressing the universal liberty to the revenging beak of their victorious
Eagles^ and minted the Governments of the world by the Rom^n Standard; had not
the Concentrici^y of your undertakings had not the Homogeniousnesse of your
actions and felici^y, vindicated and asserted the honor of antiquity, and
raised your reputations upon so high a wing of glory, that Posterity will be
los^ in the same mist of jealousy and incredulity of your own augustnesse,
yet for ever want the revivall of such examples the restoration of such
presidents to confirm them.

And to the end you may in all things either parallel or transcend that Roman
greatness, of which you are the inimitable exemplary, who enriched the heart
and strengthened the arms of their Dominions by dispersing Colonies in all
Angles of their Empire, Your pious care has already laid a most signal
foundation by inviting incouragemen^ to undertakers of that nature: In the
pursuit whereof let me beg the liberty in this Paper, under your Honors
Patronage to publish the many pressing and convincing reasons which have and
may induce you to prosecute a design of such universal concernment.

1. It will disburthen this Nation of many indigent persons, who having
formerly perhaps enjoyed a fullness of abused or ^orfeyted plenty, and at the
present reduced to an inequality of such subsistence, are commonly prompted to
their own^ and other men's ruin by making the high way^s (which should be as
public and inviolable a sanctuary as the most sacred places) an ambuscado to
innocent Travelers, by which interruption of passages, there is commonly
occasioned a decay and disincouragement of commerce, and daily examples inform
us, that Prisons at present are almost as full of crimi^all as indebted
persons. 2. It will take off all Parish charges, in providing for destitute
Minors and Orphans, whereof there are at present a burdensome multitude,
whereby the Parishes so freed, may with greater alacrity and ability, part with
c^ntributory moneys to maintain, recrui^e, and encourage your Armies and
Navies. 3. Those Orphans so provided for may by Gods blessings upon their
labors become happy and wealthy instruments, advantageous to the place of
their nativity in particular, and their whole Nation in general. Whereas the
condition of their birth and the usual way of exposing them makes them
capable of no more gainful calling then that of day-labourers, or which is
more frequent hereditary beggars. 4. The Republic in its present constitution
abounding with so dangerous a number of male contents, who commonly like Shrubs
under high and spreading Cedars, imagine the spacious height of others to be
the cause of their own lowness, may by this means be honorably secured, and
such men removing their discontents with their persons, will have a brave and
ample theater to make their merits and abilities emergent, and a large field to
fow and reap the fruit of all their honest industrious and public intentions.
5. It will to admiration increase the number of Ships and Seamen, (the brazen
wall of this Nation) all materials to advance Navigation, being abundantly to
be furnished out of those Countries, and the more ingenious Passengers by
conference and disputation with the k^owing Mariner, will take a great delight,
satisfaction, and ambition, to attain to the Theory of that knowledge, while
the less capable being accustomed and assigned to an usual part in the toil
thereof, and instructed by the ordinary Seaman, will be brought to a good
readiness therein and speedy perfection. 6. All Materials for shipping, as
Timber, Cordage, Sails, Iron, Brass, Ordnance of both metals, and what ever
else we are necessitated ^o supply our wants with out of the E^sterne
Countries, who make it not unusual to take advantages of their neighbors
necessity, and often times upon a pretense of difference or misintelligence
betwixt us, embrace an occ^sion to over-rate or over-custome their commodities,
or (a real quarrel widening) sell it to other Nations from whence we are
forced to supply our selves at a second or third Market. 7. It will give us the
liberty of storing a great part of Europe with a larger plenty of incomparably
better fish, then the Holander has found means to furnish it withal, and
will make us in no long tract of time, if industriously prosecuted, equal, if
not transcend him in that his most benificiall staple. 8. It will be to this
Common wealth a standing and plentiful Magazine of Wheat, Rice, Coleseed,
R^peseed, Flax, Cotton, Salt, Potashes, Sope-ashes, Sugars, Wines, Silk,
Olives, and what ever single is the staple of other Nations, shall be found in
this jointly collected. 9. It will furnish us with rich Furrs, Buffs, Hides,
Tallow, Biefe, Pork, etc. the growth and increase of Cattle i^ this Nation,
receiving a grand interuption and stop, by killing commonly very hopeful young
breed to furnish our markets, or store our shipping, merely occasioned by want
of ground to feed them, whereas those Provinces afford such a large proportion
of rich ground, that neither the increase of this or the succeeding age can in
any reasonable probability overfeed the Moiety. 10. By it many of your Honors
Reformadoes and disbanded soldiers being dismissed with the payment of such part
of their arrears as your own judgment (guided by the rule of your immense
disbursements) shall think a convenient recompense, by transporting themselves
thither may change their desperate fortunes into a happy ^ertainty of
condition, and a contented livelihood, which will be a means not only to
disburden this Republic (as before) but to remove all those clamors usualy
disturbing your public consultations, and to win upon them by your bounty to
invert all those fearful imprecations, with which they would (as much as in
them lies) unblesse your proceedings, into a joyful and fervent concurrence of
prayers to the Almighty to shoure down blessings upon your heads, who, next
under him, are the glorious and visible instruments of their increasing
happiness. 11. It will be a generous and moving encouragement to all
industrious and public spirits, to employ those parts with which God and
nature has blessed them in the discovery of such happy inventions as may drive
on hopeful designs with a lesser number of hands then is usually assigned to
them, which issues of the brain are legitimate and geniall to beginning
Plantations, where the greatest want is that of people: but for our own or
other popular Kingdoms where we are commonly overprest with a greater multitude
of labourer^ then imployers, by much less acceptable, since our indigent
people look upon such Engines merely as Monoppolies to engrosse their livelihood
12. It will add a very considerable increase to the Revenue of your Honors
own Customs, and I shall assume the liberty in all humility to offer up to your
more advised deliberation by way of supplement to your incomes, whether such
malefactors as the letter of the law doo^s to death, yet leaves a latitude for
extent of mercy in the bosom of the Judges, whose release oftentimes proves
not only ruinous to them so discharged, since not seldom they return to their
vomit, but pernicious to the Commonwealth reinvaded by their insolences and
disorders, might not be made instrumentally serviceable to the State, if (as it
is frequent in other Countrey^, where they are condemned to the Galleys) by way
of reparation for their crime, they were sentenced to serve a quantity of years
according to the nature of their offenses, which expired, they should enjoy all
immunities with others, and by this course be reduced and accustomed to a
regular course of life. Of these a thousand transported and employed by an
understanding improver, would by their labor advance an income of forty
thousand pounds sterling per annum, at the least, and so proportionably
according to their number.
That all these, and many inestim^ble benefits may have their rise, increase,
and perfection from the South parts o^ Virginia, a Country unquestionably our
own, devolved to us by a just title, and discovered by John Cabot at the
English expenses who found out and took seizure, together with the voluntary
submission of the Natives to the English obedience of all that Continent from
Cape Florida Northward, the excellent temper of the air, the large proportion
of ground, the incredible richness of soil, the admirable abundance of
Minerals, vegetables, medicinal drugs, timber, situation, no less proper for
all European commodities, then all those Staples which entitle China, Persia,
and other the more opulent Provinces of the East to their wealth, reputation,
and greatness (besides the most Christian of all improvements, the converting
many thousands of the Natives) i^ agreed upon by all who have ever viewed the
Country: To which the judgment of the most incomparable Ralegh may be a
convincing assertion, whose preferring of that Country before either the North
of Virginia or New England, though it may sufficiently command my submission
and acquiescence; yet for more particular satisfaction be pleased to accept
these reasons for such praelation.

1. The apparent danger all the Colonies may be in if this be not possessed by
the English, to prevent the Spaniard, who already has seated himself on the
North of Florida, and on the back of Virginia in 34, where he is already
possessed of rich silver Mines, and will no doubt vomit his fury and malice
upon the neighbor Plantations, if a prehabitation anticipate not his
intentions, which backed with your authority, he understands too much of your
power, and is too sadly acquainted with your admirable successes and generous
resolutions, not to sit down by any affronts offered to those under the wings
of your protection, to attempt any thing against such who are immediately your
own Colony, lest thereby he administers matter of a fire, to which his own
fortunes in the Indies must be a fuel, and himself raked up in its ashes. 2.
But the South of Virginia having a contiguous Ledge of at the least one hundred
Islands, and in the midst of those the incomparable Roanoak, the most of them
at the same distance from the Continent that the I Will of Wight is from
Hampshire, all of hazardous access to Forrainers, and affording a secure
convenience from surprizall by the Natives, will if possessed and protected by
your power, be as an inoffensive Nursery to receive an infant Colony, till by
an occasion of strength and number, we may pour our selves from thence upon
the Mayneland, as our Ancestors the Saxons from the Isle of Tanet into
Britain. 3. It dispences a moderate equality of heat and cold between the two
violent extremes thereof in Barbados and New England.

It will admit of all things producible in any other part of the World, lying
in the same Parallel with China, Persia, Japan, Cochinchina, Candia, Cyprus,
Sicily, the Southern parts of Greece, Spain, Italy, and the opposite Regions of
Africa.

4. It has besides all Timber for shipping, the best and reddest Cedars^ and
Cypress trees that may be found in any Country. 5. And lastly, the planting
of this Collony will open a most compendious passage to the discovery of those
more opulent Kingdoms of China, Cochinchina, Cathaya, Japan, the Phillipines,
Summatra, and all those beauteous and opulent Provinces of the East Indies,
which beyond dispute lie open to those Seas which wash the South-West parts of
Virginia, through whose bosom all those most precious commodities which enable
the Chinesie, Cathayan, Persian, and Indostant Empires, may more conveniently,
speedily, with more security and less expenses be transported thence from
Spawhawn, of other remoter Provinces to Gombroon, by a long dangerous and
expensive Caravane, and from thence to Surat, where when arrived the doubling
of the Line, Calentures, Scurvies, with a long train of diseases and Famine
attend its transportation into our own Country. 6. Whereas by expandeing our
selves to both sides and Seas of Virginia, our commerce to those noble Nations
lies open in short and pleasant voyages to the encouragement, enriching and
delight of the S^amen, and personal adventurers, who will share in the
delicacies and profits of those Kingdoms, without participating in the miseries
attending our present voyages thither. The Cargason being easily conveyed, by
much the greater part of the way, through Navigable Rivers, and from the
Eastern shore of Virginia in a month, or at the largest six weeks time into
England.
And by this means the Hollander, Spanyard, and Portugal, who (by the supine
negligence of this Nation, and its Merchant Adventurers) do with insufferable
insolence Lord over us in both the Indies, when they shall to the unknitting of
their joints perceive by your nursing care ^ver the Infancy of your Colonies,
that they are arrived under your au^pice, to cover both the Seas with numerous
Navies, and your Honors eye of indulgence and providence waking to their
security, will be content laying aside all other passions to wave future
affronts and injuries, or fall ^ deserved sacrifice to your offended justice.

And that this address may appear the more seasonable, I have (without any
privity or relation to his person) taken leave to intimate to your Honors,
that there is a Gentleman whom the public reputation and testimony of those
who have the happiness to know him render of excellent abilities, integrity, and
a never shaken affection to your cause^ in all its crisis and dangers^ through
which God with a clew of success has been your conduct) who has already
undertaken for the transportation of some men thither, and only waits for your
Honors approbation and authority, the world taking notice, hopes and
encouragement from thence, that as this Colony is like to be the eldest of your
legitimate daughters in that nature, so by your indulgence she shall have the
happiness not to be the youngest in your affection.

May that God who has begirt your house with a Grove of Laurel, continue the
advance of those Victories till the whole Nation be crowned with Olives: May no
sin, no ingratitude of ours divert his protecting ^and from us, his assistant
arm from you: May the generations to come in admiration of your virtue and
gratitude for their by you^ derived happiness, make every heart your monument,
wherein to embalme your memory whilst the Histories of all Nations and times
enrich their Annals with your names as the most serious and triumphant part of
all examples and transactions. And lastly may your own thankfulness to him from
whom these dispensations of mercy have distilled like the dew of Hermon upon
your ^eads and borders, so continue in your bosoms, that when you shall be ripe
for translation, he whose instruments you are, may welcome you with the
approbation of,

Well done good and faithful servant, Which are the undisguised wishes of Your
Honors most humble, obedient, and faithful Servant. Ed. Williams.

To the Conservers and Enlargers of the Liberties of this Nation, the Lord
President, and Counsel of State.
My Lords:
THere is the same nearenesse of relation betwixt your Lordships and the
Parliament of England, which is betwixt the Sun and Sunbeams. They from
their illustrious Luminary dispensing. You disposing those bounties of warmth
and animation, which have enriched the Commonwealth with all the Ornaments of
verdure, repullulation and beauty, which at present she is in production of,
and by the blessing of the Sun of Righteousness (guiding and fortifying your
virtuall and healthful influences) may arrive to an absolute perfection, and
be perpetuated to their happiness, to your glory.

This Introduction which acknowledges so much of your power and greatness, may
make people admire why a Treatise of this means for form and delivery, a
Presenter of such inconsiderablenes for parts and fortunes, should presume to
cast themselves upon your Lordships protection. But my Lords, such
disincouragements cannot direct any who know Humility, and a condescending
Clemency are the ordinary attendants upon your extraordinary virtues, which
take into their Patronage the restoration of the public liberty, and the
felicity of Nations.

The scope of it is the public benefit of a Nation; to whom should it be
dedicated, but to its Supporters, to its Atlantes, to those who design the
aggrandissement of it in their counsels, perfectionate that design by their
Armies? it were impatriotisme not to publish it, sacrilege to address it to
any other.

It is an indeleble brand to the high-nam'd policy of the 7. Henry, who gave
away as rich Provinces as any the eye of the World views to Spain from England,
out of avarice, incredulity or contempt (or indeed all of them together) of
Columbus his motion and condition. Your Lordships move in too high a Sphere of
prudence and circumspection to become his seconds in that his heresy of
wisdom. And who knows but providence has reserved the present opportunity to
your times, that under his conduct and auspice you might be designed his
glorious instruments of promoving a work which carries in its bosom the
advancement of the Gospel, by reduci^g the Natives, in its forehead the
enlargement of the English greatness by extending its Empire.

My Lords, the Parliament of this Nation, and your selves (like the Twins of
Hipocrates) having an inviolable correspondence of tears and smiles, of
di^asters and blessings of life and death together, the threads of both your
humane emergencies twisted and wound up in the same bottom, makes it impiety
to divide the apprecation of blessings. All which may be fitly and mutually
added is, that your living Persons and Posthume counsels may be had in just
reverence and due estim^tion: That you may shine like Luminaries in our English
Hemisphere, while the Sun compleats his daily, the Moon her nightly Circles,
till a total dissolution of Nature usher in the great day appointed for a
general audit; Where when an account is to be given of humane actions, May the
memory of your own illustrious generous, and Christian undertakings be a
cordi^ll to your consciences, the justice and public conducement of them, a
reproach to others, who have abused equal Talents of parts and power, and the
divine approbation of their sincerity, a conviction to all those who know not
how to be grateful for their own, or the general happiness.

And these as they ought to be the public exorations of all truly English; So
in particular are they the devout wishes of,

My Lords, Your most humble and faithful Servant, EDWARD WILLIAMS.

To the Reader.
IT is not out of any particular vanity, to publish my many imperfections in
Print, nor am I to my best self understanding, infected with the disease which
domineers in this scribbling age, if the public benefit of the Nation, to
which by the condition of our birth, we ow a particular duty, had not bee^e the
clear and uninteressed center of my intentions, I should be too sensible of my
own weakne^se, to expose my self to the pity of the wise, the criticisme of
the capricious, or the laughter of the ignorant; and above all to be fastened
by the ^ares upon a post, to b^g a six penny contribution to buy me, to the
trouble of their eyes and patience. Ill Books having the same unhappiness
which follows bloud-shot eyes, the very inspection of whom oftentimes
contracts the disease always a kind of abhorrency to the beholder.

But my aims are more public: he which reads this^ shall discover the
beauties of a long neglected Virgin the incomparable Roanoake, and the adja^ent
excellencies of Carolana, a Country whom God and Nature has indulged with
blessings incommunicable to any other Region. Here you may take view of an
Island and Maine, fertile to admiration, and (which is more admirable in works
of this nature) nothing but incorrupted truth in her discovery.

It shows a way to the wealthy to improve their riches, to the necessitous and
such as have lost their old, the means to erect new fortunes: in a word, it
delivers an expedient to this Common wealth, how it may shake off the disease
growing upon her poverty and decay of trading. Nothing but hands and hea^ts
wanting to make this Country a Magazine of all things to the Nation, a
Sanctuary to the afflicted, a treasure to the indigent, and an inimaginable
revenue to the Adventurers, all grounded upon those never-fayling foundations
of reason and experience.

Neither do I appropriate the honor (if any due) of being the sole author of
this Tractate, the whole substance of it full of good wishes and general
intentions, was communicated to me by a Gentleman of merit and quality, upon
perusal o^ which, I found an obligation upon m^ not to b^ry those advantages
which may arise to our ^ountry by keeping it locked up in silence: the
Gentl^mans nam^ whose permission I obtained to make it public, is Mr. John
Farrer of G^ding in Huntingdonshire, a person of quality and fortunes, who has
made good his affections to that incomparable Co^ntry, by hazarding a
considerable s^mme toward the advancing of the first Plantation, and is yet so
good a Patriot to be ready i^ promoving any good design in the Southern parts
of the (there) unequald Country. Nor is there here inserted any thing but
what my own experience of the place, and a public consent of uninterested
Authors and people, will subscribe to; there is little of mine in this, but the
Language, and some few additionall collections^ the Substance is entirely the
Gentleman's above mentioned, which I thought fit to declare, that the Reader may
ascribe and owe what ever is materially good to him; what is less acceptable
or unskilful in the contrivement, to the imperfections of

EDWARD WILLIAMS.

Virginia in General, but particularly CAROLANA, which comprehends Roanoak,
and the Southern parts of Virginia richly valued.
THE situation and Climate of Virginia is the Subject of every Map, to which I
shall refer the ^uriosity of those who desire more particular information.

Yet to show that Nature regards this Ornament of the new world with a more
indulgent eye then she has cast upon many other Countries, whatever China,
Persia, Iapan, Cyprus, Can^y, Sicily, Greece, the Sou^h of Italy, Spain, and
the opposite parts of Africa, to all which she is parallel, may boast of, will
be p^oduced in this happy Country. The sam^ boun^y of Summer, the same mild
remission of Winter, with a more virgin and unexhausted soil being material
a^guments to show that modesty and truth receive no diminution by the
comparison.

Nor is the present wildness of it without a particular beauty, being all over
a natural Grove of O^kes, Pines, Cedars, Cipresse, Mulberry, Chestnut,
Laurel, Sassafras, Cherry, Plum-trees, and Vines, all of so delectable an
aspect, that the melanchollyest eye in the World cannot look upon it without
contentm^nt, nor content himsefe without admiration. No shrubs or u^derwoods
choke up your passage, and in its season your foot can hardly direct it self
where it will not be died in the blood of large and delicious Strawberries: The
Rivers which every way glide in deep and Navigable Chan^els, betwixt the
breasts of this uberous Country, and contribute to its convenience beauty and
fertility, labor with the multitude of their fi^hy inhabitants in greater
variety of species, and of a more incomparable delicacy in taste and sweetness
then whatever the European Sea can boast of: Sturgeon of ten feet, Drums of
six in length; Conger, E^les, Trout, Salmon, Bret, Mul^et, Cod, Herings,
Perch, Lampreyes, and what ever else can be desired to the satisfaction of the
most voluptuous wishes.

Nor is the Land any less provided of native Flesh, Elkes bigger then Oxen,
whose hide is admirable Buffe, flesh excellent, and may be made, if kept
domesticke, as useful for draught and carriage, as Oxen. Dear in a numerous
abundance, and delicate Venison, Racoones, Hares, Conyes, Bevers, Squirrell,
Bears, all of a delightful nourishment for food, and their Furs rich,
warm, and convenient for clothing and Merchandise.

That no part of this happy Country may be ungrateful to the Industrious, The
air it self is often clouded with flights of Pigeo^s, Partridges, Blackbirds,
Thrushes, Dottrels, Cranes, Hernes, Swans, Geese, Brants, Duckes, Widgeons,
Oxeyes, infinites of wild Turkeyes, which have been known to weigh fifty
pound weight, ordinarily forty.

And the native Corn of the Country Maiz, is so grateful to the Planter, that
it returns him his entrusted seed with the increase of 2 or 3 hundred
interest, so facilely planted, that one man in 48 hours may prepare as much
ground, and set such a quantity of Corn, that he may be secure from want of
Bread all the year following, though he should have never so large an appetite
to consume it, and have nothing else to live upon. Nor is it above three, or at
the most four months intervall betwixt the time of planting and gathering:
Plan^ed in March, April, or May, it is ready for the Barn in June, July, and
August; and of this by a provident management, you may have yearly three or
four Harvests. The stalk bruised yields a juice as big as Rice, pleasant as
Sugar, and the green Ears boiled in such juice is comparable in agreeableness
to the palats to what ever our Pease, Sp^ragus, or Hartichoke, has either for
satisfaction or delicacy. Nor is the Corn difficult in preservation, for in
six or seven years there is scarce any sensibility of its corruption.

But lest our p^lats should have so much of curiosity as to dislike what ever
is not native to our own Country, and wheat is justly esteeme^ more proper
this happy ^oyle, though at the first too rich to receive it, after it has
contributed to your wealth by diminution of its own richness, in three or
four crops of Rice, Flax, Indian Corn, Coleseed, or Rapeseed, will receive
the English wheat with a grateful retribution of thirty for one increase,
every Acre sowed with wheat will produce six, seven, or eight Quarter of the
grain entrusted. And though Mr. Bullock be pleased to under-rate at it half
the crown the bushel, which in the Canaries ^ill yield ten and twelve
shillings, and in Spain eight, yet even in that proportion you are recompensed
with six, seven, or eight pound the Acre, of which two men by a discreet
division of their time, will plow, reap, and in at the least 60 Acres.

Which though it may appear a matter of admiration, yet I shall easily make it
apparent by the following Narration, in which such is the exactness of the
Air in this Country, that you may have five successive Harvests of the same
grain in different seasons. For though a man and a boy with much ease may plow
an Acre every day, the ground being pliable of a rich black and tender mold,
and no frosts or snowes, no usual droughts or raines to hinder the going of
the plow, yet I shall allow a month for the plowing of twelve Acres, and thus
plowing in September, October, November, December, and January, you may have
your several Harvests in June, July, August, and September, which may easily
be inned by the same hands the labor not falling in a glut upon them, but the
Corn ripening according to its several seasons.

And thus by two men's labors only you have a grateful return of at the
least three hundred and sixty Quarters of Wheat, which will at that under rate
formerly mentioned, viz 2s. 6d. yield so many pounds sterling: Nor is there
such difficulty in the threshing, as may be at first sigh't suspected, since it
may easily be tread out with Oxen, as it is usual in Italy and other Countries.

The first Wheat being reaped, if you desire a croppe of Barley, the same Land
plowed in July, will return its ripe increase in September, so that from one
and the same piece of ground you may have the benefit of two different Harvests.

But the Rice (for production of which this Country is no less proper then
those Lands which have the greatest reputation of fertility) sowed, ^eelds a
greater increase with the same labor 40 Acres of this plowed if valued but at
7s. 6d. the Bushel, will yield 600l. all done by two men and a Teame of Oxen,
who may by other labor in the intervall betwixt the committing the seed to
ground, and its ripening, fall upon Cole^seed or Rape-seed, infinitely rich
Commodities with the same facility.

The objection, that the Country is overgrowne with Woods, and consequently
not in many Years to be penetrable for the Plough, c^^^ies a great
feebleness with it. For there are an immense quantity of Indian fields cleared
already to our hand by the Natives, which till we grow over populous may every
way be abundantly sufficient, but that the very clearing of ground carries an
extraordinary benefit with it, I will make apparent by these following Reasons.

1. If we consider the benefit of Potashes grown from ten to fifty pound the
Tun, within these twenty years, and in all probability likely to increase by
reason of interdicting Trade betwixt us and the Muscovite, from whence we used
to supply our selves; We shall find the employment of that very Staple will
raise a considerable sum of Money, and no man so employed can (if
industrious) make his labor less then one hundred pound, per annum: For if
we consider that those who labor about this in England give twelve pence the
bushel for Ashes, if we consider to how many several parts of the Country
they are compelled to send man and horse before they can procure any quantity
to fall to work upon^ if we consider some of the thriftiest, and wise, and
understanding men, fell Wood on purpose for this Commodity, and yet
notwithstanding this Brigade of difficulties find their Adventures and Labors
answered with a large return of profit, we who have all these things, already
at our own door without cost, may with a confidence grounded upon reason
expect an advantage much greater, and a clearer profi^.

Nor can we admit in discretion, that a large qu^ntity of those should not
find a speedy Market, since the decay of Timber is a defect grown universal
in Europe, and the Commodity such a necessary S^aple, that no civil Nation can
be conveniently without it.

Nor are Pipestaves and Clapboard a despicable commodity, of which one man may
with ease make fifteen thousand yearly, which in the country it self are
sold for 4l. in the Canaries for twenty pound the thousand, and by this means
the labor of one man will yield him 60l. per annum, at the lowest Market. If
all this be not sufficient to remove the encumbrance of Woods, the Saw mill may
be taken into consideration, which is in every respect highly beneficial by
this Timber for building houses, and shipping may be more speedily prepared,
and in greater quantity by the labor of two or three men, then by a hundred
hands after the usual manner of sawing.

The Plankes of Walnut-trees for Tables or Cubbords, Cedar and Cypress, for
Chests, Cabinets, and the adorning magnificent buildings, thus prepared will be
easily transported into England, and sold at a very considerable value.

But that in which there will be an extraordinary use of our Woods is the Iron
mills, which if once erected will be an undecaying Staple, and of this forty
servants will by their labor raise to the Adventurer four thousand pound
yearly: Which may easily be apprehended if we consider the deerenesse of Wood
in England, where notwithstanding this great clog of difficulty, the Master of
the Mill gains so much yearly, that he cannot but reckon himself a provident
Saver.

Neither does Virginia yield to any other Province whatsoever in excellency and
plenty of this Oar: And I cannot promise to my self any other then
extraordinary success and gain, if this noble and useful Staple be but
vigourously followed.

And indeed it had long ere this grown to a full perfection, if the treachery
of the Indians had not crushed it in the beginning, and the backwardness of
the Virginia Merchants to reerect it, hindered that Country from the benefit
arising from that universal Staple.

But to show something further, what use may be made of Woods besides the
forementioned Wallnut Oil, at the least a fourth part of the Trees in Viginia
being of that species, is an excellent Staple, and very gainefull to the
industrious Labourer.

Nor is it a contemptible profit that may be made of Woods, if by boaring holes
in diverse trees, of whose virtues we are yet ignorant, and collecting the juce
thereof, a scrutiny be made which are fit for Medicinal Liquor and Balsomes;
which for Gummes, Perfumes, and Dies, and here I may justly take occasion to
complain of our own sloth and indulgence, if compared to the laborious
Spanyard, who by this very practice have found out many excellent Druggs,
Paints, and Colors, merely by bru^zing and grinding Woods, probably
convenient for such experimen^s: which if boiled, and a white piece of cloth
s^eeped in the boiling liquor^ will by its tincture discover what color it is
capable to give, and if many should fail in the trial, yet does it not fall
under the probability, but that diverse noble and useful mysteries of Nature
may be discovered by some such perforations and scrutinies. Nor are the many
Berries commonly of an excellent color and luster unfit for such experiments;
since the labor is little or nothing, and the issue if succesfull of
remarkable advantage. And this the Spanyard has experimented to the increase
of gain and reputation; and above this is so signally curi^us and industrious,
that he has disco^ered many rare and delightful colors, not only by the
means before mentioned, but by bruizing and boiling diverse Fish-shells, the
brightness and variety of colors giving him a just reason to pursue such
curious examens.

The French relations of their Voyages to Canada, tell us, that the Indians and
themselves falling into a contagious disease, of which Physicians could give no
Reason or Remedy, they were all in a short space restored to their health
merely by drinking water, in which Saxifrage was infused and boyld, which was
then discovered to them by the Natives, and we justly entertain belief that
many excellent Medicines either for conservation of Nature in her vigor or
restoration in her decadence may be communicated unto us, if projection of
this stamp be so much encouraged by hopes of reward or honor, as to be put in
practice.

By this Improvement of Woods, the Ground coming to be cleared, we have a
soil fit to produce what ever is excellent in Nature, the Vine and Olive which
Naturally simpathize together, will thrive beyond belief, nor need it be any
interruption to Tillage, since the Vintage and Harvest always fall but in
different Reasons.

That wild Vines run naturally over Virginia, ocular experience declares who
delighting in the Neighborhood of their beloloved Mulberry-trees inseparable
associates over all that Country, and of which in this their wildness Wines
have been made, of these Wines if transplanted and cultivated, there can be
made no doubt but a Rich and Generous Wine would be produced: But if we set
the Greek Cyprian Candian or Calabrian Grape, those Countries lying parallel
with this, there need not be made the smallest question^ but it would be a
Staple which would enrich this Country to the envy of France and Spain, and
furnish the Northern parts of Europe, and China it self where they plant it
not, (of which more hereafter) with the Noblest Wine in the World, and at no
excessive prices.

And from this Staple it is not unworthy of our most serious con^ideration, what
an occasion of wealth would flow upon this Nation: Virginia when well peopled
being able to match Spain in that his Sovereign Revenue, and the State by
addition to their Customs for exportation thereof according to the mode of
France and Spain, would in no short time be sensible of this most inestimable
benefit: To which if we join the Profits of our Olives^ we may (Gods
favorable hand blessi^g our industry) be the happiest Nation in Europe.

Nor need we be at that charge for Caske under which Spain^ labors, where
ever we cast our eyes upon this Fortunate Country we may find Timber proper
for it.

For the advance of which noble Staple, I should propose that the Greek, and
other Rich Vines, being procured from the Countries to which they are geniall,
every Planter in that Country might be enjoined to keep a constant Nursery,
to the end when the ground is cleared, that they may be fit for removal, and
the Vineyard speedily planted.

Further that some Greek, and other Vignerous might be hired out of those
Countries to instruct us in the labor, and lest their envy, pride, or
jealousy of being laid aside when their mystery is discovered, may make them
too reserved in communicating their knowledge, they may be assured, besides the
continuance of their Pension of a share in the profits of every man's Vintage,
which will the more easily persuade them to be liberal and faithful in their
instructions, since the public advance of this design cannot miscarry without
a sensible loss to their particular interest.

That before their going over a general consultation may be had whith them
what ground is proper, what season fit, what prevention of casualties by
bleeding or splitting, what way to preserve or restore Wine when vesseld, which
species of Wine is fittest for transportation over, or retention in the
Country, which for duration, which for present spending: It being in
experience manifest that some Wines refine themselves by purge upon the Sea,
others by the same means suffer an evaporation of their Spirits, join to this
that some Wines collect strength and richness, others contract feebleness and
sowernesse by seniority.

These consultations drawn to a head by some able person, and published to be
sent over in several Copies to Virginia, by the inspection of which people
might arrive at such competent knowledge in the Mystery, that the reservation
or jealousies of those Vignerons, could not but be presen^ly^ perceived and
prevented.

But from hence no occasion should be derived to break or fall short of any
contract made with those Vignerons, who are to be exactly dealt with in
performance of Articles, every way made good unto them, with all just respects
to win upon them, and the nonperformance of this has been the original cause
why Virginia at this day does not abound with that excellent commodity. Those
contracted with as hired servants for that employment, by what miscariage I
know not, having promise broken with them, and compelled to labor in the
quality of Slaves, could not but express their resentment of it, and had a
good color of justice to conceal their knowledge, in recompense of the hard
measure offered them, which occasioned the laying aside of that noble Staple,
the diligent prosecution whereof, had by this time brought Virginia to an
absolute perfection in it, and to a great degree of happiness and wealth which
would attend it.

And had this been as happily followed as it was prudently intended^ that
excellent Country had not hung down its desolate head in so languishing a
condition as the disr^spect cast upon her, till of late years had reduced her
to. Nor had the poor Planter (who usually spends all the profits of his labor
in foreign Wines) been impoverished by the want of it: but with delight might
have shaded himself under his vine, reaped the benefit of it in Autumn, and
buried all the memory and sense of his past labors in a cheerful rejoicing by
his own harth with the issue of his own vineyard.

And from hence might Barbados, St. Christophers, and all our Islands in the
Indies, have richer, better, and by much cheaper, wines transported to them
from a place much nearer in distance then Spain or the Canaries) and which
doubles the benefit such intercourse together, would draw them to an
association in power as well as communication of Staples.

Were this brought to a just perfection no other Nation could upon a quarrel
betwixt Us, and Spain, and France, reap a benefit by selling us their Wine at
a third Market. And what we vend now for it (that being made Native to us)
might be returned in Bullion, to the apparent enriching of the Commonwealth,
and the impoverishing of our Enemies, or at the least Friends deservedly
suspected.

All Authors of Agriculture unanimously consent that neither Arable Pasture,
Meadow, or any other Grounds are so benign genuine, or proper for planting
Vines in, as those cleared Lands are, wherein not Shrubs, but Tall Trees were
standing. And we must want a parallel in any part of the World to compare
with Virginia for tall and goodly Timber Trees cleared of all under Woods, to
which when cleared your Vines may be removed (the very removeall of them, as
indeed of all other, giving an addition to their perfection (the excellency of
transplantation being more particularly insisted upon hereafter.) But in the
clearing of these woods it will be a saving of labor, and a delight to the
Vine, besides other profits following to leave the Mulberry trees standing
there, being such a happy correspondence together such a mutual love ingrafted
in them by Nature, that we well may conclude with this Axiom, that the same
Nature joins all her excellencies together by an association of simpathies.

Nor does she wave that her happy order in Incomparable Virginia, where the
soil and climate that fits the one, is equally amiable to the other, their
loves and hates happily according, what the one shunnes, the other flies from,
what the one affects, challenges the others embraces, and were not this soil
and climate most geniall and proper Nature her self (whose production^ are
never useless) would never have crowned the Virgin Brow of this unexampled
Country, with such a universal plenty of them, or with such a voluntary
League have united them every where together.

VIRGINIA compared to PERSIA.
BUT to illustrate this with another argument: Let us compare this
felicity-teeming Virginia, as it is situated from 31 degrees of Latitude to
40^ with other Countries, ^eated in the same degrees which opens us a method of
observing what Commodities Nations so planted abound with, which found we
shall discover in this excellent Virgin a disposition ingrafted by Nature to be
Mother of all those excellencies, and to be equal (if not superio^) as well in
all their noble Staples, as in nea^enesse to their particular enricher the
perpetually auspicious Sun. And this to whom Virginia owes the publication
and po^tract of her incomparable beauty; Mr. Harri^t the noble Mathematician
delivers us by a happy instance in finding out for her ^ noble Sister of the
same Latitude, the most glorious Persia, innobled as much by thi^ comparison as
in her Empire. And those who have traveled and viewed Persia; unanimously
relate wonders of her admirable fertility in all sorts of Grain and Fruits,
with an unexpressible abund^nce of Silk and Wines: In which this her
rich-bosomed Sister claims an equality in her plenty of Mulberries, Silk, and
Gums, Vines, Maiz, Rice, and all sorts of Grain: only as a fuller-dowryed
Sister she merits a priority in fertility, pleasure, health, and temperature, a
Virgin Country, so preserved by Nature out of a desire to show mankind fallen
into the Old age of the Creation, what a brow of fertili^y and beauty she was
adorned with when the World was vigorous and youthful, and she her self was
unwounded with the Plough-shares, and unweakened by her numerous futur^
teemings.

Another eye^witnesse of this Victorious Empire, delivers to memory that
Go^^^^^ in a Province of that Country, is so incomparably fruitful, that
Dearths are never known, nor Famine ever suspected in it^ that in one only
City called E^y^ there is such an inestimable store of Silk, that there might
be bought in one day in that City as much Silk as will lode three thousand
Camells. And he is little conversant with experience or History, who is
ignorant that the abundance of Silk Native to that Country and Climate, is
almost the sole Staple of that mighty Empire, by which never tobe exhausted
Treasure of Silks the sinews and vitalls of the Persian Empire, the Sophy to
the general good of Christendom, keeps both the horns of the Ottoman Moon
from completing their ambitious Circle. And if the English East India Company
of Merchants were not wrong-byassed by the factions and sinister ambition of
some men in Authority amongst them, a great part of that wealthy Staple might
be transported into England, and by that means dispersed over all parts of
Europe to the enriching and honor of this Nation.

The digression upon this Parallel has diverted me from ampliation upon the
public benefit, which may devolve into this republic by the Olive, which
being genuine to the Vine, will by a happy consent of nature indisputably
flourish in a vast abundance, and by a transportation into the warmer Regions,
where the heat or scarcity of Cattle causes a like indigence of Butter, will
be a Staple of inestimable value, and of no smaller conducement to our own
shipping, into those provinces near the Equinox, or in those voyages where the
doubling of the Line either putrifies, or makes it of a taste little pleasing
or agreeable to the palate.

VIRGINIA compared to CHINA.
BUt to leave Persia and descend to a more wealthy and powerful parallel, the
richest and mightiest Empire in the World, lies in the same latitude and
climate with our fortunate Virginia; namely China, divided from it only by the
Southsea, and (which will be a part of another discourse) not of any long
distance from it, agreeing with it in multitude of Staples. China is stored
with an infinite number of Mulberry trees to feed Silkewormes with, and vends
silk in such a vast proportion, that in one only City Lempo, which some call
Liempo, the Portugeses, have with no small admiration, observed that one
hundred and sixty thousand pound weight of silk has been carried out in one
Ship in the only space of three Months.

Into Camb^la the chief City of Tartary (as Authors of great repute and
credit, and one who was personally there, reports) there comes ^very day from
China, a thousand wagons laden with silk. Nor is China less happy in its
multitude of navigable Rivers, in its wonderful fertility of all sorts of
grain, Maiz, Rice, etc. of which it receives every year three or fo^re most
plentiful Harvests. Rivers stored with an incredible quantity of Fish and
Foul, enriched and ennobled with numerous Mines of Gold, Silver, Brass, Iron,
and other Mettalls, Quicksilver, Nitre, All^m, Precious stones, P^arles, Musk,
Cotton, Sugars, Rubarb, China Root, vast proportions of Flax, Furs
extraordinary rich. To this happiness of soil and situation, they associate
an equal felicity of parts and industry, by which they pretermit not one span
of ground which they assign not to particular and profitable uses, and by an
ingenious division of the ground according to the quality of the soil, design
the drier part for wheat and barley, That which is more visited with an
improving moisture, to Rice and Sug^r; Ascents and Mountains to grov^s of
Pines and Chestnuts, between which are planted Maiz Panicle, and all kind of
Pulse. In other proper places are Mulberry Groves, Gardens^ Orchards, Flax, and
in a word no spot of ground misimployed from its proper advantage.

And that Virginia is parallel in neerenesse of Staples, as well as
neighborhood to the sun, to that celebrated Empire, what multitudes of Fish
to satisfy the most voluptuous of wishes, can China glory in which Virginia
may not in justice boast of? What Fowls can she make ostentation of, in which
Virginia can be esteemed inferior? Can China, insolent with her prosperity,
solely lay claim to a more singular honor for her affluence in Maiz and other
grain, for the maintenance and luxury of her plenty-wanton Inhabitants, without
an open injury to her equal, to her Maiden sister, to our incomparable
Virginia? Are her Mulberries springing from a voluntary bounty of Nature less
numerous or useful then those to which China has added all the assistance
which could be expected from advantages of transplantation, or an industrious
people? If China will descend to particulars, to compare Quantity and Quality
of Fish and Foul, Let her show us Turkies of 50 pound weight, Let her instance
an example of one hundred and fifty Foul, to reward the labor of three
charges of shot and powder, Let her publish a president so worthy of admiration
(and which will not admit belief in those bosoms where the eye cannot be
witness of the action) of five thousand fish taken at one draught near Cape
Charles, at the entry into Ches^peak Bay, and which swells the wonder greater,
not one fish under the measure of two feet in length. What Fleets come yearly
upon the coasts of New found Land, and New England for Fish, with an incredible
return? Yet it is a most assured truth, that if they would make experiment upon
the South of Cape Cod, and from thence to the coast of this happy Country,
they would find Fish of a greater delicacy, and as full handed plenty, which
though Foraigners know not, yet if our own Planters would make use of it,
would yield them a Revenue which cannot admit of any diminution, whilst there
are Ebbes and Floods, Rivers feed and receive the Ocean, or Nature fayles in
(the Elementall Original of all things) Waters.

There wants nothing but industrious spirits and encouragement, to make a rich
Staple of this commodity; and would the Virginians but make Salt pits, in which
they have a greater convenience of Tides (that part of the Universe by reason
of a full influence of the Moon upon the almost limitlesse Atlantic causing
the most sp^cious Fluxes and Refluxes, that any shore of the other divisions in
the World is sensible of) to leave their pits full of Saltwater, and more
friendly and warm Sunbeames to concoct it into Salt, then Rochel, or any parts
of Europe. Yet notwithstanding these advantages which prefer Virginia before
Rochel, the French King rayses a large proportion of his Revenues out of that
St^ple yearly, with which he supplies a great part of Christendom.

And if from this Staple the miserable French can procure a subsistence, some
of them a comfortable livelihood, notwithstanding all the private oppressions
of their grinding Landlords, the Public Tallies, Subsidies, Aides, Imposts,
and other hard Titles of authorized Rapine. What shall we imagine the
freeborne English in a Country where he owes no Rent to any but to God and
Nature, where he has Land to satisfy his desires in its extent, his wishes in
its fertility, where free quarter is a word only understood by Report, may
expect of profit and content both in this Staple of Salt, in that of Wines made
in those Countries, where either the Spanish insolence and exactions, the
French extortions, or the Turkish Imperial Robberies, though in the highest
degrees of exorbitance, are not of force so to disincourage the Inhabitants
from attendance upon the Vineyard, which notwithstanding all those
Horse-leach^^ of Imposition, returns them such a profit as make them keep ^
middle path between the ^scent of Riches, and precipice of Poverty.

Nor would it be such a long intervall (Salt being first made) betwixt the
undertaking of this Fishing, and the bringing it to perfection; for if every
servant were enjoined to practice Rowing, to be taught to handle Sails, and
trim a Vessel, a work easily practiced, and suddenly learned, the
pleasantness of Weather in fishing season, the delicacy of the Fish, of which
they usually feed themselves with the best, the encouragement of some share in
the profit, and their understanding what their own benefit may be when their
freedom gives them an equallity, will make them willing and able Fishermen
and Seamen.

To add further to this, if we consider the abundance, largeness, and
peculiar excellency of the S^urgeon in that Country, it will not fall into the
least of scruples, but that one species will be of an invaluable profit to the
buyer, or if we repeat to our thoughts the singular plenty of Herrings and
Mackarell, in goodness and greatness much exceeding what ever of that kind
these our Seas produce, a very ordinary understanding may at the first
inspection perceive that it will be no great difficulty to out-labour and
out-vye the Hollander in that his almost only Staple: Which we may also sell
at a cheaper Market then in common estimation; if we revolve the Salt to be
our own, which they buy from France, or fetch from the Isle of May, and that
the very freight of Passengers (of which allured by this improvement, and the
public approbation, there will be constant multitudes) in our own Ships
will at the least defray 3 fourths of the charges.

I should not unwillingly hear (though I despair ever to know it for a
certainety) that China did exceed us in fishing; for were it granted, we
should not imagine those wa^ry Inhabitants so circumscribed and limited to one
part of the Ocean especially the same Climate and Latitude, inviting them as
not to visit our opposite shore of Southwest Virginia in as great variety and
plenty.

And to the more curious and able Persons I shall offer what singular object it
were of variety and plenty, if they would take the advantage of some tides and
seasons, when the resort of fish is greatest to stop the Return of them out
of some Creek perpetually flowing with Salt by Sl^ces, or such other
invention: Here would those great ones generate and produce till even they
labored with their own Multitude, if permitted to increase two or three
years, who might with very small charge be maintained, and yearly render to
the proprie^^r an Ocean of Fish in a narrow confine of Water.

Nor were it unworthy the labor to make an experiment whether the S^urgion
himself might not receive a kind of Domestication in that narrow
circumscript^on, especially if we let it descend into our thoughts, that (by
small perforations in the sluices he perpet^ally admits a Renovation and change
of salt Water) he may receive the same benefit of Liberty, namely variety of
Water, which he delights in when unconfined, and admitting the Original
Breeder not to thrive well by such imprisoning, yet Customs ascending as high
as Nature in the Breed, would make that Familiar to them, which peradventure
might have been offensive to the first Spawner, and should they delight (as in
some seasons of the year Fishes do vary their Resorts) at any time in fresh
water; A large Pond dug near having either Springs to fe^^e it, or Raines
to fill it, might by communication of a Sluice receive both them and Salmon,
when they s^eke after the Freshes.

And that Fishes may be unwilded, and become Domestic, History will
sufficiently inform us, wherein are delivered Reports of some who grown more
particularly intelligent, were distinguished by names, and understood themselves
so called: and Mar^iall in one of his Epigrams to Caes^r, (I mean Domitia^)
tells the Prince speaking of Fishes so instructed, Quid quod nomen habe^t and
ad Magistri Nomen quisque sui venit citatus? And further, Manumque lambit, a
thing, which though a Poet, and con^equently bold, ev^n to untruths, yet he
durst never have obtruded upon Caesar, whom himself makes a party in the
experiment.

And to add something to what has formerly been delivered of Balsomes and
Colors, why from the Livers and most unctuous parts of those more delicate
Fishes, may not curiosity find a means to extract an Oil; which (if it be not
Medicinal, though I am inclined by several Reasons to bel^ene the
affirmative) may notwithstanding artificially distilled after its first
extraction prove a delic^cy for the Tables of Princes and Great Ones,
especially for Sauces, and other Confections which Luxury has found out for
the irritation of dull and retreating appetites. But I cannot believe it to be
deprived of its particular virtue in Physical operations, and the industrious
conclusions of our Ancestors have by such probations discovered many rich
Mysteries of Nature; whilst we either glutted with our own plenty of
Receipts, or out of a too fond a Reverence we pay to antiquity acquiesce in
their prescriptions, as in the ne plus ultra, the Hercules Pillars of Wisdom,
beyond which there were no passage, or else fear every innovation brings
inconveniences in his Train, which opinion if it had possessed those our
Ancestors, the World had continued in ignorance, and must for ever have layne
sick of an incurable folly in the Fools Hospitalls.

For what concerns the Flax of China, that we may not lose the smallest
circumstance of Parallel with Virginia, Nature her self has enriched this
her bosom Favorite with a voluntary plant, which by art, industry, and
transplantation may be multiplied and improved to a degree of as plentiful,
but more excellent Nature: Which because of its accession to the quallity of
Silk, we entitle Silk Grass: Of this Queen Elizabeth had a substantial
and rich piece of Grograine made and presented to Her. Of this Mr. Porey in his
discovery of the great River Chamonoak, to the South of James River delivers a
Relation of infinite Quantity, covering the Surface of a Vast Forest of
Pine-trees, being 60. miles in length.

It had been wished that the injun^tion given to every Planter to set so many
thousand Plants of this kind had been effectually prosecuted: The intermission
whereof has been a prejudice not easily imaginable: Nor is it yet too late to
effect it, and in all probability by transplantation it may thrive beyond
comparison larger, and the skin of it grown more tender and delicate, may
arrive to some equality with the labor of the Silke-worme, if it be managed by
such Rules of Nature best suit with its production.

For Hemp there is a natural kind of Hemp, a species of Flagg in that
Country, from which being boiled you may strippe a long and fine skin, not
only proper for Cordage^ but the ^iner sort singularly useful for Linen; of
this two hundred weight has been sent into E^gland, of which has been made
excellent Cordage, and very good Linen. This, by observation of the soil it
grows in, and transplanted into Grounds of like, but richer property, would
together with tht Silke-grasse make a Staple of admirable Return and Profit;
Provided every Planter had an injunction for this, as well as the former to sow
or set a convenient proportion, to which his own profit (quickened with the
imposition of a mulct in case of neglect) would easily invite him. And by this
means would Virginia not only furnish her own people, but supply other
Nations with Stuffes and Linen.

To the Brass of China, we shall oppose the Virginian Copper (or Gold, for
yet it is doubtful) for by a concurrent Relation of all the ^ndians, justified
to several English of Quality, particularly to the Earl of Southampton in Mr.
Poryes Narrative, to Sir William Berkely, all seconding Mr. Heriots Report,
that within ten days West toward the setting of the Sun, the Natives of that
Country gathered a kind of a Red Sand falling with a stream issuing from a
Mountain, which being washed in a sive, and set upon the fire speedily, melts
and becomes some Copper, which they show us, but as they say much softer. We
shall only suppose it to be Copper, contrary to the opinion of diverse knowing
men, who apprehend it for a Richer Metal; but melting with such ease two parts
in five turning to a Solid Metal, the other three parts being peradventure not
any thing of the Oar, but only such Rubbidge, as joined to the Oar in
rouling, and this falling merely from the superficies of the Mountain, yet a
Rich Copper; what eye enlightened with the smallest beam of Reason, will not
conclude it for an extraordintry accession of Wealth to this Country? and why
may not the intralls of this Mineral be Gold, since the skin and crust of it
is Copper? Nature her self oftentimes dealing after the mode of diverse great
men, delighting to lay an unregarded outside over her Richest Linings.

To proceed in contin^ation of our compa^ison with China, if it abound more in
visible Silver (of which with our abundance of Staples may quickly put us into
a ^ondition of entering into completion with) yet cannot Virginia in all
probabili^y be destitute of that Metal: For besides diverse conjectures
grounded upon natural circumstances: Mr. Gage in his Relation of the Indies,
as^ures us that the Spaniards have found out a rich Silver Mine on the back
side of Florida Westward, in 34 degrees of Latitude, and the farther they
extend their search Northward, the more Rich and Pure the Mines discovered
improve themselves.

Nor shall we plead inferiority in Pearls with China or Persia, since Mr.
Heriot assures us of a large quantity of Pearls found amongst the Natives,
spoiled by their ignorance in boring of them, and defacing their oriental
luster, by exposing them to the fire. These were found amongst the Indians at
Roanoak, and the Relations of the Natives on all hands unanimously concur that
the South and West of this opulent Country was stored with such abundance and
variety, that the Indians used to make and adorn Babies with them: And one of
the English had collected a Bracelet of very oriental Pearl, to the number of
five thousand, which were all lost in the Return to England.

If China suppose a merit of precedence in Musk, Virginia may justly oppose
them with her Musk Rat, or Muscassus, which in all probability cannot but be
the same; for it is a tradition received into the Number of truths, that the
Confection of their Musk in that Country is bruizing and burying a certain
Creature to putrefaction, of which this Odor is effected, and it is very open
to conjecture that this Musk-Rat or Muscassus, whose flesh and skin are
extraordinary redolent and durant, and of which there is an infinite plenty, by
such order may be brought to the same perfection. Neither is it so improbable
that this Odor should proceed from putrefaction, which is naturally an
abhorrence to the Nosthrill: for if you apply too near to the substance of the
Musk, there is an occult subolency of such a putrefactive original. Neither
are all excretions of Nature in themselves offensive to the sense of smelling,
for the Flux of the Civet-Ca^ is accounted amongst our most sovereign
Perfumes: And this experimented will be a Staple of noble use, and no less
benefit.

Nor shall we yield the Laurel of preeminence in Richness of Furs to
China, if the Furs of Beavers, Otters, Martines, and above all Black Foxes
(which are upon some part of this Continent) may pretend any title to
Richness: And yet have we been hitherto so supinely negligent to permit the
Dutch and the French to carry away most of this precious Commodity, to trade in
our Rivers, under-sell us, and which discovers either an ^mplacable malice or
insatiable avarice, trade with those Indians (of whom we have no reason to
nourish any great confidence) for Muskets and Powder.

To conclude, what ever else China may presume to boast of: Whether Nitre,
Alum, Quicksilver, Rhubarb, and China Root, of which some we have already
discovered: If we consider the parallel in Latitude, the equality of
temperate Climate, the parity in soil, and its fertility, the similitude in
brave Navigable Rivers, the unanimous congruity and consent in diverse known
Commodities, we shall have an ample basis to ground conjectures upon, that
what ever singularity of Nature that Nation may imagine her self Victorious
over others, will be found equal in this Garden of the World, this aemulous
Rival of China, Virginia: And the Chinese may with as great justice deny the
Europeans the benefit of both eyes, as boast that they precede in any thing
except Antiquity of habitation and a long experienced industry, this great
Luminary of the new World Virginia.

What ever other commodities, the Novelty of inhabiting this amorous Virgin
has made it appear defective in, as Sugar, Indigo, Cotton, Ginger, and other
advantageous Staples, we shall appeal to all who have seen this unexampled
Country; (we mean Roanoak, and the more Southern parts, and those Countries
toward the fertile Mangoack) whether it be guilty of any contrariety,
distemper, or extremity, which might hinder their production. The Sun, which
in other Countries makes his visit in Flames and Droughts, here casts his
auspicious Beams, and by an innocent and complementall warmth, courts the
bosom of this his particular favorite, hastening and disposing its womb for
ripe productions, which salute him in an absolute perfection. Winter Snowes,
Frosts, and other excesses, are here only remembered, never known. The purling
Springs and wanton Rivers every where kissing the happy soil into a perpetual
verdure, into an unwearied fertility: no obstructions in your expectations,
attempt and hope them, prosecute and enjoy them.

Nor have we in design to lay any imputation upon the Barbados, which already
abounds to admiration, with the Staples last mentioned, yet it will become
our charity to wish the Country as healthful, as it is fruitful; that it may
answer the expectation and merit of its most industrious and public spi^ited
Planters^ who have given a brave example to all, by the effects of their
industry and unwearied constancy. From a thing almost lost to memory, (at the
least to reputation) they have raised the honor of that Island, to be a
subject of admiration for wealth and Staple, and that so little a circumference
of Ground should be able to vent the value of two hundred and fifty thousand
pound yearly, as so^e Merchants have maintained, not only adds to the weight
and measure of their just estimation, but increases the favorable wishes of
all ^overs of industry, that they had a larger proportion of ground to improve
upon.

And if an invincible sloth does not possess us in Virginia, (we mean the
South) why should not we raise an equal or greater profit upon as fertile and
convenient a soil? especially if we consider the populousness of the place,
has so raised the price of Land there, which we have here gratis, where number
of inhabitants do so little take from our abundance, that they add to our
wealth, security and plenty, and the sole means to increase and improve upon
Staples.

We have made it apparent that what ev^r China has of St^ple or delicacy, is
produced or producible in this above-example Virgin. But to show that even
China her self must in some t^i^gs giv^ plac^ to this more happy Maiden, Te^ra
sigillata, or Lemnia, (as peculiar an income to the Grand Signiors Treasury, as
that of Salt is to the French Kings) and of which China can no way boast, is
native to this Country; Vin^s are either not natural, neglected, or not
understood by the Chinese, but in this incomparable soil the Grape presents
it self every where to your delighted prospect. And what shadow can there be
of scruple that Wines well cultivated, and issuing from a rich Grape, will not
be as commodious a Staple to that voluptuous and gluttonous Nation, who wanton
away their wealth in banquets, as the Wines of France and Spai^ are to the more
Northern and less abstenious Nations of Europe?

There needs no objection be made against this Staple; for the Southw^st part
of Virginia being once discovered, the Sea laid open and that passage complete
in all its numbers, the pleasure of the commerce, the richness of returns,
and the extraordinary quicknes of the profit, will invite so many to come over
and plant that commodious quarter of Virginia, that as we shall never labor
with too numerous a multitude of inhabitants, so we shall not have any great
occasion to complain of the pa^city of Planters.

Nor is Tobacco in those Indian seas (especially cured as in Virginia, and of
that strength and excellency) a commodity of inconfiderable commerce,
particularly if we call to mind what gain there is by the exchange for
Indian commodities, so that any ordinary understanding may comprehend that
although Tobacco should yield but three pence the pound in India, yet by way of
barter with those Nations where the return quadruples the value in England,
the gaynes gotten by it might be very considerable.

But if we may believe Printed Relations (and the person delivering it so
clearly, is, in my opinion, worthy of all credit) Tobacco from Surat to Moco
yield ten for one profit, returned in Eastridge feathers to England you have
six to one profit; but this is for those Planters who are so infected with that
disease of the Country, that they cannot admit of any other Staple, though
more gainefull and less laborious. Yet is not Tobacco without its virtues: for
the Spaniard has found out, besides the use of it in smoke, (or the smoky use)
that the juice thereof (when green) applied to any wound cut, sore, and
without any distinction, whether green, festered, or cankered, will heal it
speedily, and almost miraculously; the leaf bruised or stamped, and applied to
any bite or sting of a venomous quality, to any wound made by a poisoned arrow,
the green leaf heated in hot ashes, and laid upon any part of the body
afflicted with aches, will work effects answerable to the most powerful
operations of Nature.

The Benefit and part of the Silke-worme mystery treated of.
BUT to show to the World that we may equal the best of the Western
Kingdoms in this noble mystery of Nature the Silke-g286 worm: That France and
Italy are much below this Mignon of Glory and Profit, the universally
advantageous Virginia, we shall upon those in^^llible demonstrations of
Nature, make evident, having the clew of truth, reason, and modesty to direct
us.

It will not be denied by any, whose forehead is not too brazen, that no
Country is so proper for adventitious as its own Native Commodities^ the
seeds of things suffer a deterioration by changing the propriety of that soil
which was geniall to them, and the exact order of Nature suffers a diminution,
if we imagine any other Climate or Region more proper for the perfection of
any thing, then where it is originally produced.

T^lli^r aff^rmes that this mystery of the Silke-worme has not been
experimented in Europe above a thousand years, being transmitted to our
Climate out of the Asiatick World, in so much that Italy has not been above
200 years enriched with this industrious Creature, France received it from
Italy, and it is observed, that the warmer the Region, by so much larger and
stronger increase and texture receive they from the labor of this admirable
and natural Weaver. France being of a colder temper then Italy, their Wo^mes
are weaker, in the more Northern part of that Kingdom from one ounce of seed
they profit five or six pound of Silk increase, worth at the least ^ os. per
pound, in Languedock, and the warmer Provinces the same quantity is increased
to 7, 8, or 9l. but in Brescia, of Calabria seed, they use usually to make
eleaven or twelve pound of Silk from the same original proportion.

The poor people in both those Kingdoms buy their Mulberry leaves to feed
this profitable and industrious Spinner, and the very charge of those leaves
amounts to a full half of all other their expenses.

The Nobility of Italy and France (the Grand Duke of Tuscany himself,
descending into a part of this profit) make up a considerable part of their
Revenue from their Trees, the Leaves of every one b^ing valued according to
their goodness and quality, from five shillings to twenty and upwards, so that
diverse make an income of three, four, five, sometimes a thousand pounds per
annum from the sole profit of their Mulberry trees.

The Grand Duke from the sale of his, rayses an income communibus annis, of
sixty thousand Duca^s,

Yet diverse Gentlemen in Italy make a larger increase of profit, by setting out
their Mulberry trees to necessitous people, for half the gain arising from
the worm so fed. Those poor contribute their seed, employ their labor, and
are at all expenses in bringing the silk to perfection; yet notwithstanding
when completed, the Gentleman who sets out his Trees, divides the moiety of the
entire profit, for the hire of his Leaves only, yet are these people, ma^gre
this difficulty, comfortable gayners.

And the same Tellier is bold to affirm, that non obstante the
disagreeablenesse of the Country to that worm, in the Kingdom of France from
the sole revenue now of Silk, arises a greater intrade then from their Corn,
Oil and Woad put together, which grow in that Kingdom in vast proportions.
And another French Author affirms, that the benefit of the Silke-worme, (of
which France has had no trial till within these fifty years) arises to four
Millions per annum, ste^ling, and this he pretends to have all circumstances of
truth and certainty, drawn from an exact computation to confirm it.

If France (an almost improper Country for this improvement) can raise within
the verge of fifty years, so large and numerous a revenue, what shall we
imagine Italy (a warmer Region, and by much more convenient, although not
altogether Native for this enriching creature) may merely upon this Staple
return in their Treasury, having besides the advantage of Climate, a hundred
and fifty years precedence in the mystery, and their seed more s^rong, better
fed, and less subject to diseases and casualties?

But Virginia a Country which Nature has no less particul^^ly assigned for
the production, food, and perfection of this Creature then Persia or China
stored naturally with infinites of Mulberry-trees, some so large that the
leaves thereof have by Frenchmen been esteemed worth 5l^ in which the
indigenall and natural Worm has been found as big as Wallnuts, and
thriving, in the South thereof in admirable plenty and excellence; if this
mystery were but duly followed, and industriously promoved, might be a Magazine
for all the Western World, and singly in her self outvy France, Spain, and
Italy, in all their advantages collected.

Here the Leaves are only sold by nature, who requires no other satisfaction
then industry to make use of her bounty. Timber to erect their Fabrics is
provided, and costs no more then preparing a benevolent Sun, and a Serene
Sky^ contributing their indulgence to its perfection. No n^rrow assignation of
Ground (richer then the most fertile France or Italy can pretend to, or boast
of) to plant those Trees on, if not near enough to the settled Plantations; in
brief, all the conveniences imaginable to assist and advance this to the
Noblest Commerce in the World, if neglect and sloth make us not ungrateful to
our selves, and nature, by abusing our selves, by not using her bounty.

To further this happy design, let us d^scend into an unequal comparison: Let
us compare our most incomparable Virginia, where the Mulberry and the Worm are
aboriginall to Italy, where they are only adventitious: Let us imagine our
own Worm of that strength and greatness only equal to those of Brescia and
Italy, where the usual of come from six ounces of seed is 72, o^ at least 60
pound weight of Silk, and adhearing to this Parallel; let us see the
apparency in the profit^

A man and a boy, if their hands be not sleeping in their pockets, will feed
as many Worms as come of six or eight ounces of seed till they be past their
four first sicknesses, and within some 14 days of spinning: Indeed the last
14 days require a more extraordinary diligence and attendance, a more frequent
and careful feeding, because in that time they conceive, gather, and store up
the disposing matter from whence the Silk comes, which by an incomprehensible
mystery of Nature, they after as it were vomit out of their mouths, and spinne
out of their bowels. At this more particular season, there is a necessity of
adding the labor of three or four helps more (to which Women or Children are
as proper as Men) which is an inconsiderable accession considering the gain
arising from it.

That you may know the reason why Women, Children, lame and impotent persons
are as ^itting to attend the last fourteen days, as Men, will appear by
their labor, which is nothing but to feed them within doors, cleanse, dry
and perfume their lodgings, with some strengthning^ but not overstrong odor.

And as one skillful in this noble mystery is sufficient for the employing,
overseeing, and directing hundreds under him, so (the skill being rather
experimentally to be taught, then built upon long and ambiguous precepts) he
may be able to perfect all those under him, within the five or six weeekes
time of their employment in the full understanding the mystery. And the better
to encourage both the teacher and learner of the mystery, the master should be
invited by reward to be liberal in communicating his knowledge, and those
under his instruction encouraged by arguments of honor and profit proposed to
the best proficient, would disperse seeds of emulation and diligence, since
every one would employ himself seriously to engrosse and appropriate to
himself the reputation and advantage in the victory.

And in boys and children, disputations frequently set on foot, with some
slight distinction of merit, would make all that are ingeniously disposed,
quicken their observation and diligence, to gain the credit of prelation.
Though to take off all disincouragement or despair, from those less
apprehensive and docible, in this noble and gainefull Trade of Silk, there is
no such absolute necessity laid upon them to be supersticiously and precisely
curious in observing the Book Rules, and written Precepts, that upon the
omission or unpunctuall observation of any of those Precepts in hatching,
lodging, feeding, and tending of the Silke-wormes, we should imagine such
minute deviations might occasion an improsperity or general failing: for we
will admit something may be wanting either in materials, accommodation, or
preciseness of knowledge; yet may the work (a higher and irresistible cause
not interrupting it) prosper and succeed, notwithstanding such defect, to the
great contentment and gain of them which keep them.

Let us imagine it to be granted that the indigency of the person improving the
incommodiousnesse of the place, or want of House-roome, which the Books
exactly tie us to, be in many things preterr^gular (though such a supposition
may fall upon any other part of the World more justly then Virginia, where all
materials and convenience answer our exactest wishes) yet will daily examples
confirm us, that in Languedoc, Provence, and other parts of France, and as
many in Spain and Italy, amongst the common sort of that exaction tired
people, that one poor low-rooft Cottage, and one Room in it is all the house
extent they have to take their sleep in, dress their miserable diet, and
serve themselves of for use and retirement; yet does this industrious Creature
(such are the blessings with which God rewards the sweat of Industry) thrive as
happily (and sometimes answer labor with a greater fellcity) as those which
the curiosity of Richer persons fit with all commodiousnesse of Chamber
feeding, and attending, which is a speaking enco^ragement that no man should
despair, but reposing a cheerful confidence in the blessing of the Almighty,
with this Resolution, that what ever means, what ever curiosity, art, or
precept, may contribute toward the preparing and fa^ilitation of a work, yet
the end, the event must depend on his eternal goodness to crown it, and all
our labors projected with never so great a Talent of humane wisdom and
experience, must conclude with this never failing truth: That except the Lord
build the house their labor is but lost that build it^ Except the Lord keep
the City, the Watchman watches but in vain. We must therefore lift up our
hearts and eyes with thankefullnesse unto the Hills, unto the Mountain of
Israel, and Rock of David, from whence those streams of blessings must
acknowledge their sole, their original Fountain, which may serve as an
admonition, that neither the whole, nor any part of the work should be begun
without applying our devotions to him: Let it therefore be the Morning Omen to
the work, and the Evening auspice, Lord prosper the work of our hands,
prosper good Lord our handy works. After the Reposall of this confidence in
God; let him apply himself with his greatest industry and ability, with this
comfort and assurance, that he cannot but make a considerable return: Though
we should be much injurious to Art (the noble right hand and Midwife to
Nature) if we should deny a more promising probability of a riper and fuller
gain the more curious and observant he is in following all the approved
experiments, Rules, directions, and precepts thereunto belonging.

But the chiefest aim and intention of those Rules are to illustrate the
perfection of this Art, and to inform your knowledge, and better your future
experience and preventionall care, if any misadventure arrive, or miscarriage
in the Silke-wormes, or if they prosper not equally this year with the last;
for by inspection upon them you may understand the cause and reason of such
misadventure, and with it the remedy; and this also takes away all despair or
disincouragement for men, commonly men till they are convinced in the natural
cause of a disaster or failing attribute, all such mischances to Nature, or
else impute the non-thriving to their own misfortune by a ridiculous opinion
that they are not ordained to be fortunate in this or that Mystery, so
freequently does Fortune incur the blame of humane neglect or ignorance.

Besides we are to imprint in our knowledge, that no Rules c^n have so much of
generality and exactness, which will not admit of deviations arising from some
particular and variable circumstances. We must not therefore conform the
nature of the Climate to our Rules, but our Rules to it, in which we must
resume to your deliberation how, and in what one Climate differs from another,
how the constitution of this year varies from the next, or the precedent, the
immediocrities of heat, cold, drought, and moisture, serenity, or mists, etc.
The manner of their lodgings, the quality of the wind to be admitted or
excluded: To ^emper a season inclining to a preternaturall coolness with an
artificial heat, to refresh and infrigidate the Air in times of immoderate
heat, by admitting the cooling Air and Winds proceeding from a cooler
Quarter, and this to be observed with a more particular care; when they spinne
their Silk, that Creature then being very obnoxious to be stifled with too
much heat.

There must be likewise a providentiall regard in a moist season, that the
Mulberry leaves be carefully dried after their gathering, before they be
administered for food to the Silke-worme: But if the season partake more of
drought it will be wisdom to let the leaves lie and shade a little after
their gathering, that they may have them cool and refreshing, and in seasons
of temperature and continued droughts, it may be very requisite to water the
Roots of the Mulberry-tree, which will be a refreshing to the leaves, and this
is usually practiced in Spain; especially if the Mulberry-tree be seated in a
hot or dry ground, which otherwise must not be so prescribed without particular
caution.

Nor is it below our consideration to weigh the condition of the place in which
the Mulberry is planted, if in a sower foul or wet soil to collect what
inconvenience that food may bring unto your worm, and therefore if your
necessity will admit it to avoid such wholly, if not to use them with such
qualifications as may make them l^ast offensive.

After having regard to the nature of the ground your Tree receives ^ts juce
from, the quality of the season, in which you gather them; it falls next to
your consideration to compare the kind and nature of the Tree, together with
the kind and nature of their seed, worm, and silk, and directing your self
by an exact observation of particular circumstances, so to make exceptions, and
to order every thing with judgment and discretion thereafter, that your Books
and experience may by that means walk hand in hand together.

But time and observations will afford you many experiments, out of which
perhaps some more rules of Art may be framed, in diverse particulars, more
consenting to the Country and Climate of Virginia. Which finding, after good
trial thereupon made, it will become the reputation of a good Patriot in
general, and a good Master of a family in particular, to digest them into such
a regular order and method, that the publication thereof may be a common
benefit to all, and a private memorial to particulars.

For since in Persia and China it does not fall under likelihood, that they can
oblige themselves to observe all particulars in its strictest limitation, where
such an infinite quantity of silk passes through the hands of the people, it
is very agreeable to reason that in a Climate of the same nature and parallel,
namely Virginia, there may be rules found out of far l^sse brevity^ and more
pertinency, then have yet been considered or published.

And yet where all these Rules are curiously observed, they make not only in
Spain and Italy, but in the colder parts of France a far greater gain (the
quantity of adventure and time considered) by thus chargeably fe^ding of
Silk-wormes, then by any other commodity whatsoever.

But to avoid that inconvenience of fetching leaves a far off, or attending the
growth of your own Mulberries, or that necessity which makes the poorer sort
of our own miserable people to lodge them in that Room which is their
Kitchen, their Chamber, their all. With what ease and convenience may there be
a house set up in the middle of a Grove of Mulberries, naturally growing, where
the Silkewormes, in a dry Cabinet of Boords, after the manner of Sicily, may be
kept (described more largely in the Books which treat of this Silkeworme, then
can be expected in this paper) set up with stones in it, in case the Country
and season require it, either to correct the ill sents, or (if so be they are
seated in cold^ moist, or shady places, of which your own sense and experience
will quickly acqu^int you) to give the air a temper and qualification, which
if not prevented, may destroy your work by killing the Silkeworme.

And this Lodge built for them, the season of the year will invite your self
and family (I mean such part of your family as you assign to this work) to
lodge there also, the time being at the most but six weeks, and for the first
month, one third of your family will be sufficient to feed them, but the last
14. days; the other 2. thirds will be requisite that the worms may be more
often and plentifully fed^ the well feeding at that time contributing much to
their strength and perfection, and consequently to the improving your expected
silk, both in quantity and quality.

That all may be invited and courted to this undertaking, in this glorious
Country, Nature has left us destitute of no materials. To erect these slight
silken lodgings, will be no more expenses, then your labor; nor is that any
greater, then to cut out some posts and studdes, fit them, and set them up^
then to cleave and saw out small quarters, rafters, plankes, pales, and boards,
to make and set up the sides of the house, in stead of more substantial walls,
and to cover the roof in stead of Tile. For the effecting of all which with
the le^ser trouble, that Country affords abundance of Woods, which will run
out, slit, and cleave into long lengths and br^adths, which by the directnesse
of the Ground will rive in a manner, as if they had been sawen for the work.
All which must be so close laid, joined, and nailed together, the one still
lapt over the other, that no Wind or Rain may penetrate therein to offend
that labo^rious Creature, and this may easily be prevented, if such chinkes and
open places as you shall discover be stopped up with Lome, Clay, and Lime, of
which materials in those Countries you will find no want. And to this
purpose the Indian Mats, and the like things may be made good use of in this
way, which will be sure to keep out Wind and perhaps Rain: But to these
things your own inventions, pro re nata, will abundantly furnish you with
matter of preventing casualties: Nor will it be unseasonable to repeat the
extraordinary convenience of Saw-mills, which in this case will be in a high
degree serviceable to you, and of this the whole Colony will be beneficially
sensible in boards, ^lankes, housing, Silk-worm-lodgings, Timber, shipping, and
all particular kind of uses.

And this once erected, with what speed may such a house be clapped up
together, with a few nails ^ne lopping over another, either long like a
Bowling-Alley, that the functions of the Family may be distinct, and no
offensive heat or sent disturb the Worm in his curious operations.

Or being in doubt of surprisall, some Families going into the Woods together
may equally join together, and those wooden houses (still observing that the
Rooms where the worms are may be set end and end together, that so the
Kitchins and their lodgings may be still the two extremes) may be cast into
the form of a Fort which pall^sadoed, and your house sentinelled by half a
dozen of good Dogs, will be a sufficient defense against all the Natives of the
Country.

And this may be in case they work not in common, which if by compact they
agree upon, the Lodging for the worms may be cast in the middle of such a
circle, the Timber houses round about shading them from over much heat, wind or
moisture, and the necessary fires there made, will thoroughly clear the air of
all vapors and mists which may disorder this innocent Spinner. The Silk
Harvest ready, and the increase brought to a just estimation: The Cohabitors
may according to the agreement made betwixt them, return with their Dividends,
and this removal into the Woods will have the same nature of content which the
Citizens take in a time of vacation and City weariness ^Citizens being never
so weary as when they have no work) to visit the delights of the Country,
though with different ends; since these in their Voyages of pleasure expend,
the other both save and increase their stock and treasure. These Boards (the
work ended) being taken down are serviceable for seven years together, and
easily erected or renewed.

I am not altogether of advice, that the Indians be hired to assist you in
these Remoter Works, as sensible how apt they and the Devil t^eir Tutor may
be to embrace an occasion of being treacherous; but if they could be brought to
work by Parties (well watched and Spies amongst themselves set over them) in
the midst of our most populous Plantatio^s, with their Wives and Childr^n,
who will easily run through this curious, but not heavy labor and may be
sufficient pawnes for the Indian fidelity, if cunningly divided, they would be
very serviceable in this kind for a small Reward, and peradventure might be
made great use of for this work hereafter by undertaking it themselves, which
may be manifested for these Reasons.

1. First, the Indian is naturally curious and very ingenious, which they show
in all their works and imitations: the only thing that frights them from
bringing any work to perfection, is the labor attending it. 2. But to feed his
curiosity, there is nothing in the world more proper then this curious atome of
Nature the Silkeworme: to see this untaught Artist spin out his transparent
bowels, labor such a monument out of his own intralls, as may be the shame,
the blush of Artists, such a Robe that Solomon in all his glory might con^esse
the meannesse of his apparel, in relation to the workmen, c^nnot but bring
them to admiration; and that those spi^i^s whose t^oughts are of a higher wing
then ordinary, may be convinced of a divine power of the hand of God in the
Creation: which gaynd upon him, it will not be impossible to drive him to an
acknowledgement of Redemption, if private ends or any other respect then that
to Gods glory, possess not those who should cover a multitude of sins, by
winning a soul to his Creator, and forcing him from the jaws of his
Destroyer. 3. In this curiosity there is little or no labor (a thing which
they abhor) their women and children will be sufficient to go through with
it: and if they could but be brought to it, our T^ade with them for silk would
be of greater consequence, then all their Furs or other commodities put
together. 4. By this means it were possible to fasten Clothes upon them, which
if once it were effected, that which Mr. Bullock excellent patly calls, The
Universal not of Nature. Ambition would cement them to a more orderly course
of life, and one still striving to outvie the other in bravery of habits: there
would be no labor under Heaven like this, to reduce them to civility, the
toil thereof being inconsiderable^ and the profit great to him in respect of
his now trifling Merchandise: and to us by trading with them, might be
returned for 5^. the pound at the most in commodities. 5. By this means would
he be brought to plant great quantities of Mulberry trees round about his
Plantation, which according to hi^ constant inconstancy, evermore shifting,
would necessarily, our ^wne numbers increasing, fall into our hands and
possession, or if he should against the tide of his nature abide by them, yet a
very inconsiderable trifle would buy the propriety from him. 6. The Silkeworme
harvest lighting at such a season of the year, wherein he by improvidence has
wasted all his Bread-corne, at which time he usually retires into the Woods to
seek a thin s^bsistence, by the allurement of this great profit he would
undoubtedly s^ay at his Plantation, and allow us a share in his increase of
Silk, for such provision of Maiz as would maintain him, and this would be a
large accession of profit to the English. 7. Admitting Virginia in its whole
extent from Cape Henry Southward (as a work so easily compassed, and such
profit ensuing thereupon, especially to the Weroances or Reguli^ who have many
Wives, Slaves, and Children, would hardly fail from being a universal labor)
to contain in all thirty thousand people, of which the fourth part or more
men, if this Staple be followed by them, and our vigilance preventing any
Traffic of other Nations with them, it will yield the Colony of course a trade
with them worth clear a hundred thousand pound per annum.
Neither do I comprehend a sufficient Reason why in so happy a Climate as that
of Virginia; there may not be a double Silk Harvest: This I am sure of, that
there are secrets in Nature of retardation as well as acceleration of Springs,
and both being industriously brough^ to the experiment, the acceleration
ante^eeding the first Spring, and the retardation postvening the latter by
three weeks, (which may easily be effected by election and distinction of
ground to plant in) and at the latter end of the Harvest the seeds being
disposed and ripened for production, will without doubt produce an effect
answerable to the most inestimable profit intended by it.

That the election of Ground may do this, we may see by freequent examples
betwixt things well cultivated, and that which is never transplanted from its
first wildness, and there are many presidents round about us, where in one and
the same Towne^ one and the same fruit have oftentimes three Weeks distance of
time betwixt their unequ^ll maturity; the natural warmenesse or coldness of the
Ground occasioning the advance or procrastination of fruits according to its
several disposition.

Nor can such a course be any interruption to Harvest or Vintage, both coming
much after the season of the Silke-worme, though I should (in submission to
better judgment) conceive that with transplantation of trees (such as they
would have come later then ordinary, for that purpose being loosed from the
Ground near upon the as^^nt of their sap would spring for that season
according to their expectation later then is usual, and the next year its
novelty of ground having made it wanton will come much earlier, and more
improved then those whose fixure to the place of its first pullulation keeps
it self to its former constancy, and by this means the later Harvest would
not be at the most three Weeks time after the (usual) income of the first.

And without doubt the Chinese and Persian could not vend such vast quantities
of Silk, with which they fa^shion so huge a part of the World with one single
Harvest, which though we are at present ignorant of, yet what should
discourage us from delivering such conjectures to a trial, since the examen of
it is not without probability, nor the discovery without an extraordinary
certainety of profit?

Those who will object that notwithstanding ^00 years practice Italy has not
discovered this mystery, or if discovered, found it destitute of success, may
be pleased to receive this Answer: That there is an immense disproportion
betwixt the happyest Region of Italy, and the South of the excellent Virginia.
Italy (and that annually) is subject much to inclemency of Winters, in respect
of our more temperate Maiden, where Snows and black Swans are alike Prodigies;
the cold there is rather like a Phletomy to tame the Plethorick abundance of
Springs, then dead it: Nor are the Springs of Italy so early as ours in that
Climate, and the Mulberry shooting forth later then all other T^ees by much,
may by this means of transplantation and heat of soil, be equal with the
first, and by that early appearance give daylight to this and other more
abstruse Magnalia.

I have ins^sted so much the longer upon this Mystery of the Silk-worme,
because (if it were handled by a better pen, judgment, and ability) it is
every way noble and sublime, so much worthy the knowledge, not only for the
benefit (which is extraordinary rich how ever) but for the admiration of
Nature, who has ab^eviated all the Volum^ of her other Miracl^s into this her
little, but exact Epitome, like that Artist who contracted the whole body of
Iliads and Odysses into a Nutshell.

Besides what we have said of Silk we shall find the Indian profitable to
himself, and as in the Staple of Wines, of which when he has received ^he
whole knowledge, we cannot make the least tittle of doubt, but he will with
all eagerness prosecute it: First, because it concerns his belly, to which no
people under Heaven are more indulgent; and secondly, his Wife and Children who
plant his Corn may take the charge of the Vineyard with not much more labor.
But that which turns to our advantage is, that the Indian communicating the
knowledge of the Grape to his Neighbors, and they transmitting it all along as
far as New Spain, will stir up the Spanish jealousy to interdict all
Viti-culture amongst them, and as far as the extent of his power can fathom to
prosecute severely all such Natives as shall make it a subject of their
industry to the prejudice of Spain. This must of necessity make strong
combinations and leagues against the Spanish Tyranny, which though they are not
of themselves able to shake off, yet will the Spanyard fear to extend himself
further (except in such strength as at present his condition denies him)
knowing the Indians untinguishable thirst of Revenge, and his laying hold of
all opportunities to put it in execution, with all the powers of his
understanding cruelty and malice.

And thus shall the Spanyard in case he attempts our supplantation be
constantly discovered by the siding Indian, and if there be a necessity to
prevent his malice, by turning his design upon his own head, infinite
occasion of intelligence may we have from the enraged Native, how to attaque
him in his strongest security, where either the distance or impassability of
the way will make him confident and careless.

Further use may be made of the Native in fishing after Pearl, to which if we
allure him by a constant Trade with him for them, his own profit will quickly
enlighten his desire of more, and that desire quicken his industry.

That Virginia affordes multitude of Pearls, Mr. Lane is sufficient to give
public information, where he tells us a Relation delivered to him of a
Weroance, who had so great quantity of Pearl, and did so ordinarily take the
same, as that not only his own skins that he wears, and the better sort
of his Gentlemen and Followers are set with the said Pearl; but also his beds
and houses are garnished with them, and that he has such quantity of them that
it is wonder to see: These are Mr. Lanes words exactly.

Nor is there any difficulty in the discovery of this, or engrossing the Trade;
especially since we are the Masters of the Country, and if any other Nation
should attempt to partake in the benefit of our Trade, the strength of Virginia
is at present such as may repel by violence, all Foreign encroachments upon
their trade and livelihood.

The Indians unanimously consent that twenty two mil^s beyond the Falls, is a
Rock of Crystal, and this they evidence by their a^rowes very many whereof
are headed with it. And that 3 days journey from thence, is a Rock or Hill of
Silver Oar. Beyond which, over a ledge of Hills, by a concurrent Relation of
all the Indians, is the Sea, which can be no other but that Sea which washes
the shore of China, etc.

That this report of a great Sea Southwest beyond the Mountains, cannot have
the least of fiction or confederacy, since all the Indians from Canada to
Florida, do unjarringly agree in the Relation, is obvious to the meanest
apprehension.

The discovery whereof, if we fall upon it by degrees, will be a work of no
long time or difficulty, but the unexpressible profit and glory of the action,
will raise the noble head of this above example Country to such a high Zenith
of wealth, power, and luster, that it will be reputed a very remarkable degree
of felicity to any Nation which shall reach to such a Vertical point of glory,
as to be reputed but our second in these most noble considerations.

By this means what wealth can there be in those richest provinces of the
World, in those Countries which Nature created for her Cabinets of excellency,
which we shall not discover? What discover without a power of Appropriation?
What opulency do^s China teeme with which shall not be made our own by the
Midwifry, by the Juno Lucina of this virtuall passage? This by a happy
transmigration, by an innocent Magic will convert that Country, (which by a
swelling denomination, yet without not some preten^e of Reason its Natives call
by a Title signifying all under Heaven) into our Maid of admiration and envy
Virginia. Her Silke-worm shall spinne for Carolana, her Cloth of Gold be weaved
for Roanoak. The English name shall keep company with the Sun, and those
Nations who owe him a particular adoration shall honor it as the next thing
sacred. The E^sterne Nations oppressed with the slavery of those ill^strious
horseleeches their princes, will come under our shadow, and by a thick repair
to our most glorious and happy Maiden, live with us in that liberty, which
Nature in their Creation intended to the noblest of his creatures Mankind. And
by this recourse all those curiosities of Art, in which those Eastern Nations
transcend Europe, will be conveyed to us with their persons. Cattle and Horse
in which they abound, will be sold to us for nothing, for European trifles,
whilst the more necessary Stapl^s of this our Western World, will be sold at
advantages not convenient to be mentioned. The voyage short, easy, rich, and
pleasant. No doubling of the Line, no calentures, s^urvies, or other long
passage diseases, to affright or distaste the laborious Seaman: whereas now the
enfeebling and destroying of Mariners is almost an unavoidable consequence of
those long and dangerous, rather circumferences^ then voyages.

But lest we should sing a Paean before a Victory, it will not be unworthy our
labor to discourse what means may be used in this Discov^ry. Which if it
should miss in its prosecution, (for which failing there is not the least
shadow of probability) yet might carry a vast profit to recompense all your
pains and expenses.

That it must not be attempted at the first heat, but must have more recourses
then one to the fire of a Trial, will be made apparent by these reasons.

First, the inconveniency or non feysibility of carrying so much provision as
will serve the Discoverers, whose number, in my opinion, cannot be lower then
two hundred, if we let slide into our deliberation the many unknown Nations,
through whose territories we are to make our passage, and which by common
estimation, are much more numerous in the Inland, then Marine Countries.

Next admit we undertake and compass it with such a number, yet the discovery
not being capable of secrecy amongst such a multitude of undertakers, the
public resentment of such a felicity approaching, not suffering people to be
silent; we should have this arrive to the Spaniards knowledge, who will roll
all stones under Heaven to dispossess or prepossesse, and indeed the danger
his Peru, Chili and Philippines, by such seating, may lie obnoxious to, will
add spurs to his inclination to prevent us, which till we be in in a
condition to resist, may be effected with our absolute ruin.

The safest way therefore is, by degrees to steal upon the design, and take
our way thither, by ceasing of places of advantage, very frequently found in
that Contry, which we may progressionaly fortify at every twenty or five and
twenty miles distance, and to these places we may constantly ^end supplies of
victu^lls and ammunition, not only for the men there Garrisond, but for our
own reception and maint^nance in the Discovery: and these men standing
continu^lly upon their guard, may (I mean those most rem^te) by conference
with the Indians, discover with much ease, of what distance, what access, what
harbors, what frequentation, and by what people the neighbor Sea consists of;
to take with them exemplars of all Mineralls, Drugges, Dies, Colors, Birds and
Beasts, drawn ^o the life in colors, which (by an invitation of reward) will
be a surer means of discovery, (if any such be) then by multitudes of people,
whose number commonly (as in the ^x^mple of Fernando Soto in Florida) hastens
no other discovery, but that of unavoydable famine, and being usually, either
through nec^ssity, or a disordred manner of living irregular and ^ngoverned,
fright the inhabitants from all commerce and conference or else make them join
in a confederacy to abuse and remove them by telling their unwelcome Company,
golden lies, and miracles of Countries farther distant, where they are likely
to find small satisfaction for their covetousnes or hunger.

Reason and experience will cond^mne us of folly, if we should refuse to
profit by commendable examp^es, though proc^eding from Enemies or Friends
suspected: It will be therefore an incitement irreproveable to commend to our
own imitation the Custom which the industrious Spanyard practices in his
design of discoveries: Every one of the associates carry a little horn about
their necks in such journeys, by which means if the error of the night or
thickenesse of the Woods occasion any separation betw^x^ them, or an Ambuscado
of Enemies make the passage doubtful, by winding of that Horn, p^esently
notice is given to the rest, who upon receiving the sound give the first winder
notice of their residence, to which they may repair, or testify their
apprehension and readiness to prevent all hostile stratagems.

The same indefatigable Nation in their passage over Rivers, presently make
themselves light Canoas after the Indian mode, with which entering themselves
and swimming their Horses (whose heads they keep above water by a collar
fastened to the Boat) they overcome difficulties of currents, which to any
other but those seem^ insuperable, and indeed their labor in this kind show
them of admirable Resolution and Constancy.

Though we may entertain grounds of hope and confidence, that this discovery
of the South Sea may be made without any tedious Land-journey, since it is
certain that from the great confluence of Waters in the Gulf of St. Laurence,
four mighty Rivers receive their sourse, the first whereof pouring it self
North into Canada, another running Eastward into the Sea called Hunsons River,
the third running Westward into the Maine are already discovered, but the
fourth upon which we have reason to fix high expectation be^ding Southward to
Florida, washes all the backside of Virginia, and may in all probability
discharge it self into the South Ocean, which if it suit with our conjectures,
Virginia will have by that means a double accession of security and
convenience.

For our security it will be a natural bar betwixt us and the jealous
Spanyard, who if he should injustly continue the possession of ou^ Florida,
which is indisputably English; yet thus dividided from us by a vast River full
of ^slands, and places convenient to command the Channel fortified and
maintained by our Nation, he is too full of providence and caution to attaque
us, if once in so good a posture.

For the convenience which sufficiently speaks it self the ease of
transportation by water, and all in our own Channel, the saving of Land
charges, and probability of a more speedy passage, are prespicuous arguments to
commend it.

And to confirm the probabilities of this passage by the Lake the more
strongly, the Indians of Canada confessed to James Cartier that it is but a
Months sailing, from thence to go to a Land where Cynanon and Cloves are
gathered. Others told the same person, that from the place where they left
their Pinnace, there is a River which goes South-West, from whence there is a
whole Months sailing to go to a certain Land, where there is neither Ice no^
Snow seen, where the Inhabitants do continually War one against the other,
where there is great store of Orenges, Almonds, Nuts, and Apples, with many
other sorts of Fruits. What ever belief other men bestow upon this Relation, I
know not; but tru^ly in such a general concordance of Reports, where there can
b^ no room left for confederacy or design, to be persuaded of the truth
therein, cannot have any vicious tincture of facility or credulity.

But it is time to remit these high and noble achievements to the prosecution
of those who have more power and ability, who may give such a discovery the
honor of their names, and transfer a perpetual illustrious memory to
posterity, we shall only suppose it faisible and hope the effects will answer
such supposition.

Which if it should fail, why may not Virginia in her future felicity of silk
be a new China and Persia to Europe? why may not all the spicery of the East
flourish with an equal success in this our most justly tempered Climate?
already can Virginia boast of Cinnamon, which if transplanted might not be
inferior unto any? why may not the Cloves perfume Virginia with as aromatic
redolency as the Philipine Gardens.

Our air is more serene, better tempered then theirs, nor have we any more
sense of Winter to hinder the ascent of sap then the Moluccians, if it be any
thing more harsh in cold, yet is it but a check to a peradventure too forward
Spring. What multitude of flowers have our late Gardens in England seen non
native to this soil or Climate? Fruits thought solely proper to Italy and
Spain flourish here to the envy of those Count^ies, who see often times the
Colonies in a happier degree of prosperity then the Mother, for Fruit and
Flowers.

But these designements must be the Daughters of time, curiosity and industry,
to whom away may be made passab^^, and easy, by that uncabinetting and
deciphring of Nature, Garden Philosophy, what harsh disposition in the World
will not be lenified and refined by these curious conclusions? Dioclesian could
postpose the science of governing Mankind to the knowledge of managing his
Scions, to see those Plants grow up, which his own laureld hand had set, watered
and attended^ and accordingly flourish, was in a manner the production of so
many Children, who in this have the advantage, that their florescence is not
subject to selfe-deprivation, give them but an acceptable ground^ a bounteous
Air, and an arriding Sun and they answer the most exact desires of the
Setter or Ingrafter; but Children, let them have all the Auxiliares of a full
Fortune, warmth of education, and heat of encouragement, by some private
disease of the genius, by some secret malignity in nature, or its right hand
custom, seldom or never thrive according to the wishes of the Parent, they
are either too rank with insolence, too much parched with rashness, or
withered with infamy and luxury, that those which planted them instead of
delight in that which they esteemed their Masterpeece, have nothing but a
Spring of indignation, or an Autumn of Melancholy to answer their expectation,
and are so far from contentment at their grows that they would have reckoned
it amongst the Smiles of their Fortunes, that no warmth of theirs had
contributed to their production, no indulgence to their continuance and
education.

These allu^ements are for those whose delights only are interested and
denoted to this retired activity; but those who look further will find (that
which is rarely or never contingent to other contentments) this pleasure to be
attended with an inestimable p^ofit, and one of the most certain returns in
nature: But this fertility-labouring Country, especial^y in its Southern
beauties, in its Roanoak excellencies, like to a Princess, all composed of
Bounty, suffers no address to be made unsatisfied. Gentle Winters to court
your seed, warm Springs to marry them to perfect Masculine ripeness, nothing
but ingratitude and indiligence to delay or divert its liberality, hitherto
(like those confined Virgins in a barbarous Seraglio) it has suffered the
imputation or injury of sterility by a non-complacency in its Savage Amourists,
the abundance of perfection having put them into a satiety or incapacicy of
enjoyment.

The truth of this being abundantly manifest, an apparent profit and delight
inviting the able and industrious; necessity must be the next Argument to those
whose Poverty can plead no excuse for their indiligence; yet this laborious
necessity is not so ungrateful as in England, and in other more thick-peopled
Countries, what ever you sweat for in this bounteous Region, is crowned with a
recompense amazing your expectation; such things as make poverty and life
wearisome, contempt of, or impossibility of any melioration to their condition
are things here never charged upon honest indigence, or denied to a
commendable industry, nor can they palliate their sleep and sloth with a
pretense of wanting materials to work upon, or plead that such things as
should employ them must be first had out of England, since there is enough
abundantly and naturally in that unpresidented Country to employ their
industry, to enrich their labor.

Though Silke^grasse is unquestionably a Staple which will be Neighbor to the
profit of the Silke-worme, though the natural Hempe-flagge may be a
Merchandise in time equal to English Flax, though the Sarsaparilla be an
extraordinary vendible Commodity, though Pipestaves be so beneficiall^, that
with not many drops an extraordinary workman may make his labor worth sixty
pounds per annum.

Though he has fish there, and in such abundance that the attending diligently
upon two seasons, only returns him a Reward of one hundred pound sterling in
Sturgion, Salmon, Herings, Mackrell: Potashes a rich and never decaying
Staple, etc. Yet since against this an objection may be made what course they
may take for their provisionall subsistence. Those who apprehend such doubts
will be pleased to receive this answer, in which if they are sensible of Reason
they cannot fail to receive satisfaction.

There is no man will ever be denied the loan of Corn for his house-spending,
and seed till the Harvest; if he be a single man he may prepare as much ground
if cleared, and set as large quantity of Corn for his own spending and
repayment of what borrowed, in two days space as will abundantly suffice him
twelve Months.

Admit there be no cleared Ground, yet if he but unbarke the Trees one foot
round after the Indian mode to prevent the shade occasioned by the leaves,
which such unbarking quite destroys, the Corn (set betwixr those Trees) will
thrive and prosper exceedingly, and their greund thus prepared will last seven
or more years successively, and this work cannot last him above five days at
the longest.

If he have a Family, his Wife and Children will be able to bear part in that
labor, and many others.

For Provision of flesh, if he can use his piece he may, even at his labor in
the Woods, have opportunity of killing Venison, Hares, Wild-foule (in their
season innumerable) and Fish, of which the R^vers are all times plentifully
furnished, and of great delic^cy; if in all this abundance he is yet
apprehensive of Famine, we shall refer him to the number of those who are
afraid to be starved for meat in a Cooks shop.

Besides what a small sum of money will buy your Cattle, and Swine in
Virginia? Whose feeding co^ts them nothing but thanks to God, who has spread
that superficies of that noble ^ountrey with perpetual friut and verdure.
Poultry in infinite variety and plenty, the forbearance of whose increase for a
small term of years will make them so numerous, that they may always have a
full table.

The W^st Indie Potatoe (by much more delicate and large then what we have
here growing^ besides that it is a food excellently delicious and strongly
nourishing, fixes himself wherever planted, with such an irradicable
fertility, that being set it eternally grows: of this an extraordinary pleasing
and strong drink may be composed.

Nor is the Maiz l^sse commendable for bread then malting, of both which in its
use it ^ffordeth a peculiar goodness and convenience: And I am much to learn
how a poor man can in justice complain of want, when he is as it were
besieged with such plenty: This for provision may abundantly satisfy, but if
he can be content to forbear debauches and profuseness for the first three
years he may by any of the means aforesaid arrive to such a condition of
^hriving. that he may allow himself a large latitude of expenses (that first
three years once expired) without much empairing his fortun^s.

But since all men either by constitution of age, oppression of years, or
different education, are unable o^ improper for the Fi^^^et or Hatchet, I shall
offer them a way which may be less laborious and peradventure more gainefull;
yet before I descend to this, I must take leave by digression to enlarge
something which I have already hinted on, nam^ly the benefit of transplantation.

The removing and transposition of Wild Plants, does with an ^xperimented
happiness wonderfully mitigate and engentile their (...) noble nat^^e; whether
(as an A^thour delivers it very elegantly) it be by reason that the nature of
Plants, as of men, is desirous of Novelty and peregrination, or because that at
their parting from their former grounds they leave there that rank wildness
virulency and ill quality from the Forest, where is first rooted the grate^ull
novelty and allurement of a well cultivated s^yle makes it receive a new by
exiling it from the old savagenesse and indomestication of its first seat and
nature.

Since then the removing of wild Plants adds so much to their improvement and
melioration confirmed by natural Reason and unerring experience: Why may not
the diligent labor by removeall and transposing this excellent Staple of Silk
grass, make it thrive equally in greatness and goodness, there needs no
more art to be used then that of comparing the soil (transplantations into
worse grounds being naturally improsperous) and though there appear now
somewhat of trouble (though nothing of lab^ur) in peeling the silky skin of,
yet that it may be broken as Flax or cleared by some Instrument (the Commodity
richly rewarding the nobility of any invention) to this purpose; time and
further experience will no doubt to the public enriching of the Colony and
this Nation make apparent. In this any one which is not sworn a servant to
ease and sloth, may with a small toil reap a considerable profit.

Next, what will not those Vines produce if well husbanded after their
transplantation, and in this most delightful labor the gain is so appareut
that almost the blindest judgment may perceive it.

Orenges, Lemons, Pine-aples, Plantanes, Peaches, Apricocks, Pears, Aples, in
a word all sort of excellent Fruits will grow there in full perfection; you may
sleep whilst they are growing, after their setting or engrafting, there needs
no more labor but your prayers, that they may prosper, and now and then an eye
to prevent their casualties, wounds or diseases.

Sugars, Indigos, Cotton, and Ginger, require a greater industry; but if we
consider the difference betwixt the two Climates of Barbados and Virginia, the
immoderate heat of the first and the exact temper of the other, the labor
though it may require as frequent handling, yet is by much less toylesome.

In a word, if a man be yet timorous of a thriving condition in this Country;
I shall with his pardon believe him, distrustful of Gods providence; or if he
be so vitiously disposed as to hope after a Land where he may enjoy an
undisturbed plenty without the sweat of his brows, the Maps are so extremely
d^ficient in the description of such a Country, that I must desire him to
look for a new World and Kingdom, for such an easy accommodation.

If any make an Objection why this Country stored with all these Riches,
furnished with all these Staples, has so long held down her head in the
lowness of a desperate condition? Why being capable to crown her brows with
Garlands of Roses and plenty, she sat desolate amongst the Willowes of neglect
and poverty? Let them but recall their Memory, how by the prevailency of
G^ndamore the Co^poration was dissolved, their patent cancelled, to which if
we add the cooperation of the Indian treachery in their first massacre, they
will cease their wonder at its languishing condition^ and convert it to a full
admiration, how that Colony could ever raise her endangered head out of those
Gulfes of distraction, in which the Gold of Spain, the disincouragement of the
Court, the discontent of the better sort of Planters, and the desperate
negligence of the more inconsiderable had in humane opinion irrecoverably
involved her.

But the incomparable Virgin has raised her dejected head, cleared her
enclouded reputation, and now like the Eld^st Daughter of Nature expresses a
priority in her Dowry; her brows encircled with opul^ncy to be believed by no
other tri^ll, but that of expeperience, her unwounded womb full ^f all those
Treasuries which indeere Provinces to respect of glory, and may with as great
justice as any Country the Sun honors with his eye-beames, ^ntitle her
self to an affinity with Eden, to an absolute perfection above all but
Paradize.

And this those Gentlemen to whom she vouchsaf^s the honor of her Embraces,
when by the blessings of God upon their labou^s s^ted with the beauty of their
Cornefield, they shall retire into their Groves checkered with Vines, Olives,
Mirtles, from thence dilate themselves into their Walks covered in a manner,
paved with Orenges and Lemmons, whence surfeited with variety, they incline to
repose in their Gardens upon nothing less perfumed then Rose^ and
Gilly-flowers. When they shall see their numerous Herds wanton with the luxury
of their Pasture, confess a narrowne^se in their Barnes to receive their
Corn, in bosoms to express fully their thank^fulnesse to the Almighty
Author of these blessings, will ch^arefully confess: Whilst the Incomparable
Roanoak like a Queen of the Ocean, encircled with an hundred attendant
Islands, and the most Majestic Carolana shall in such an ample and noble
gratitude by her improvement repay her Adventurers and Creditors with an
Interest so far transcending the Principal.

A valuation of the Commodities growing and to be had in Virginia: valued in
