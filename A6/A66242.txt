COMMONS Assembled at Westminster the Eighteenth Day of February, 1688/9.

LONDON: Printed by John Starkey and Awnsham Churchill, Printers to the King
and Queens Most Excellent Majesty's. MDCLXXXIX.

His MAJESTY'S MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
I Have lately told you how sensible I am of your Kindness, and how much I
value the Confidence you have reposed in Me.

And I am come hither to Assure you, That I shall never do any thing that may
justly lessen your Good Opinion of Me.

I think it necessary to acquaint you, That the Condition of Our Allies Abroad,
and particularly that of Holland, is such, that unless some speedy Care be
taken of them, they will run a greater Hazard than you would have them Exposed
to.

You your selves must be sensible, That the Posture of Affairs Here require
your serious Consideration; and that a Good Settlement at Home is necessary,
not only for your own Peace, but for the Support of the Protestant Interest
both Here and Abroad.

And particularly the State of Ireland is such, that the Dangers are grown too
great to be obviated by any slow Methods.

I must leave it to you to consider of the most Effectual Ways of preventing
the Inconveniences which may arise by Delay, and to judge what Forms may be
most proper to bring those things to pass for the good of the Nation; which I
am confident are in all your Minds; and which on My part shall be always ready
to promote.

FINIS.
