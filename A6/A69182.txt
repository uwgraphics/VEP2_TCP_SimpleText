The unnatural Wife:
Or, The lamentable Murder, of one goodman Dauis, Locke-Smith in
Tutle-streete, who was stabbed to death by his Wife, on the 29. of June, 1628.
For which fact, She was Araigned, Condemned, and Adjudged* to be Burnt to Death
in Smithfield, the 12. July 1628.
To the tune of Bragandary.


IF woeful objects may excite,
the mind to ruth and pity,
Then here is one will thee affright
in Westminsters fair City:
A strange inhumane Murder there,
To God, and Man as does appear:
oh murder,
most inhumane,
To spill my Husbands blood.
But God that rules the host of Heaven,
did give me ore to sin,
And to vild wrath my mind was given,
which long I lived in;
But now too late I do repent,
And for the same my heart does rent:
oh murder,
most inhumane,
To spill my Husbands blood.
Let all cursed Wives by me take heed,
how they do, do the like,
Cause not thy Husband for to bleed,
nor lift thy hand to strike;
Lest like to me, you burn in fire,
Because of cruel rage and ire:
oh murder,
most inhumane,
To spill my Husbands blood.
A Locke-Smith late in Westminster,
my Husband was by trade,
And well he lived by his Art,
though often I him vbbraide;
And often times would chide and braule,
And many ill names would him call*
oh murder,
most inhumane.
To spill my Husbands blood.
The second part.


I And my Husband forth had bin*
at Supper at that time,
When as I did commit that sin,
which was a bloody crime;
And coming home he then did crave,
A Shilling of me for so have:
oh murder,
most inhumane,
To spill my Husbands blood.
I vowed he should no Money get,
and I my vow did keep,
Which then did cause him for to fret,
but no wit makes me weep;
And then in striving for the same,
I drew my knife unto my shame:
oh murder,
most inhumane,
To spill my Husbands blood.
Most desperately I stabbed him then,
with this my fatal knife,
Which is a warning to Women,
to take their Husbands life;
Then out of doors I straight did run,
And said that I was quite undone,
oh murder,
most inhumane,
To spill my Husbands blood.
My Husband I did say was slain,
amongst my Neighbors there,
And to my house they strait way came,
being possessed with fear;
And then they found him on the floor,
Stark dead all weltring in his goore,
oh murder,
most inhumane,
To spill my Husbands blood.
To the same Tune.
Life feign I would have fetched again,
but now it was too late,
I did repent I him had slain,
in this my heavy state;
The Constable did bear me then
Unto a Justice with his men:
oh murder, etc.
Then Justice me to Newgate sent,
until the Sessiors came,
For this same foul and bloody fact,
to answer for the same;
When at the Bar I did appear,
The Jury found me guilty there:
oh muther, etc.
The Judge gave sentence thus on me*
that back I should return
To Newgate, and then at a Stake,
my bones and flesh should burn
To ashes, in the wind to fly,
Upon the Earth, and in the Sky*
oh murder, etc.
Upon the twelfth of Iuely now,
I on a Hurdle placed,
Unto my Execution drawn,
by weeping eyes I past;
And there in Smith-field at a Stake,
My latest breath I there did take:
oh murder, etc.
And being chayned to the Stake,
both Reeds and Faggots then
Close to my Body there was set,
with Pitch, Tar, and Rozen,
Then to the heavenly Lord I prayed,
That he would be my strength and aid*
oh murder,
most inhumane,
To spill my husbands blood.
Let me a warning be to Wives,
that are of hasty kind,
Lord grant that all may mend their lives*
and bear my death in mind,
And let me be the last I pray,
That ere may dye by such like way.
Oh Father
for thy Sons sake,
Forgive my sins for aye.
FINIS.
