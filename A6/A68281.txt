CERTAIN REASONS and Arguments Proving that it is not lawful to hear or have
any spiritual communion with the present Ministry of the Church of England.

Ier. 50.14.15. Put your selves in array against Babel round about, all that
bend the bow, shoot at her, spare not arrows: for she has sinned against the
Lord.

Cry against her round about, she has given her hand, her foundations be
fallen, her walls be destroyed: because it is the vengeance of the Lord, take
vengeance upon her: as she has done, do unto her.

Rev. 18.6. Reward her even as she has rewarded you, and double unto her
doubles according to her works: in the cup wherein she has mixed, mix her
the double.

Printed, In the year of our Lord: 1608.

To the Christian Reader, grace and peace in our Lord Jesus Christ.
THe Reasons following, I have published (gentle Reader) for thy good, and for
the truths sake which we witness to the world. The causes of our separation
from the Church of England are diverse, as in other Books already printed may be
seen. This treatise handles purposely but one of them, which is concerning
their present Ministry: and was (for the substance of it) written long since
in nine Reasons, which now I have revised and reduced to seven. In the
propounding and handling whereof, I have both inserted diverse things which I
met with in some writings of Mr John Penry that faithful Martyr of Jesus
Christ; and annexed sundry testimonies and Arguments out of the Books of the
forward Preachers now abroad in men's hands. The third Reason, which is taken
out of Rev. 14.9.10.11. has his weight according to the right understanding of
that place. Concerning which (as Mr Ridley that blessed Martyr of Christ See
hereafter, p. 59.
did in his time) I will commit the judgment thereof, and of all the rest, to
the spiritual man: to be tried and judged by the word of God, which is the
only rule of truth; and so to be received and approved, as they shall be found
to bear weight, being laid in the skoales of Gods sanctuary; and not any
otherwise or further at all.

The Reasons are set down in the form of Syllogismes. And the two first
(which conteyne in them the grounds of the rest) have more specially the
confirmation of them also handled after the same manner. A course that some
have desired for the further trial of our cause. Which now I wish it may help
them forward to yield unto the truth. And if thy self (Christian Reader)
reapest any fruit by our labors, give God praise, and pray for us the
unworthiest of his servants, who are every where contemned blasphemed and
oppugned, for the Name of Christ: Ier. 30.17. Mat. 5.12. and 10.25. Heb. 12.2.
1 Pet. 4.12. etc.
As has been the lot of the Churches and servants of God in all ages, yea and
of Christ our Lord himself. But it is enough for the disciple to be as his
Master, and the servant as his Lord. Therefore will we bear it with patience,
and rejoice in it: waiting till the Lord our God bring forth his truth as the
light, and our judgment as the noone day. Great (we know) is the truth, and
strong is the Lord, that will destroy Babylon, and will mainteyne the cause and
avenge the blood of his servants. Rev. 17. and 18. and 19. chap. with Ier. 50.
and 51. chapter

Now therefore let me exhort all, both Preachers and people, high and low, to
compare together the Scriptures of the Prophets and Apostles concerning the
work of God and fall of Babylon past and to come; and to take heed unto
themselves, that they harden not their hearts, but whiles it is called To day,
to hearken unto the voice of the Lord, who says unto us concerning the
spiritual Babylon and all her assemblies and worship, Go out of her my people,
that ye partake not with her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues:
as of old he said to the Jews concerning Babylon in Chaldea, Go out of the
mids of her my people, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce
wrath of the Lord. Rev. 18.4. with Ier. 51.45. And let there be heard, Ier.
50.28. with Rev. 19 ^.^.
the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babel, to declare in
Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God, the vengeance of his Temple. For it is
written, Thus says the Lord of hosts, The thick walls of Babel shall be broken
down, and her high gates shall be burnt with fire; and the people shall labor
in vain, and the folk in the fire, and shall be weary. Ier. 51.58. Which how
true it is and will be found in the Antichristian Babylon, as it has been in the
Chaldean, let all that are wise observe, and make good use thereof unto
themselves.

And in special (as now I have occasion) let me entreat the Preachers seeking
reformation, seriously to mind the Books which many of them selves have written
against their present estate, and with indifferency to judge whether their own
Arguments (howsoever intended or alleged otherwise by themselves) rely not
upon such grounds, as are in very deed against their Ministry, as well as
against their Ceremonies; against the executing of the one, as well as against
the using of the other; and withal against the keeping of communion with them
in such estate: albeit they have not hitherto so applied or acknowledged it
themselves. Which God in his time give them to do for their own comfort and
benefit of others.

And the Lord guide us in these and all other things by his word and spirit in
the way of his truth, keeping us from error and every evil way, and
preserving us to his heavenly kingdom, by Jesus Christ: who is the way, the
truth, and the life. Amen.

Thine in the Lord: Francis Johnson.

REASONS and proofs from the Scriptures, and other testimonies, Showing that
it is not lawful to hear or have any spiritual communion with the present
Ministry of the Church Assemblies of England.
The first Reason.
ALl are bound in the worship of God to hear and communicate only with that
Ministry which Christ has given, and set in his Church, for that work. But
the present Ministry of the Church Assemblies of England is not that which
Christ has given, and set in his Church, for the work of his Ministry.
Therefore it is not lawful for any in the worship of God to hear or communicate
with the present Ministry of the Church-assemblyes of England.
The proof and declaration of this Reason, in the several parts thereof.

THe Proposition or first part of the Reason is evident and certain: 1. Because
Christ has given his Ministry to his Church, as a fruit and confirmation of
his ascension into heaven, whose gift therefore cannot therein be refused without
denying or derogating from the truth and benefit of that his ascension. Ephe.
4.8, -- 12. with Ps. 68.18. 1 Cor. 12.4. Rev. 1.13.16.17.18.20.

2. Because he has set his Ministry in his Church, as Lord and King thereof,
whose appointment therefore may not be altered or disobeyed. 1 Cor. 12.5.28.
with Heb. 3.5. 6. and 9.10.11. Mal. 1.6. Luke 6.46. and 19.27. Col. 4.17. 1 Thessalonians. 5.12. Rev. 1.5.13.16. and 22.18.19.

3. Because he builds and works by and in his own Ministry, as God, who
is gracious and powerful, working all in all, to whom therefore in his worship
all submission and obedience is to be yielded in his own Ministry only, and
in no other whatsoever. 1. Cor. 12.6.28. with Heb. 3.3.4. 1 Thessalonians. 4.8. 1 Timothy
3.1, -- 15. Rev. 1.8.16.20. and 2.1. and 3.1.14.

4. Because to his own Ministry only, he calls his people and promises
his presence and blessing: so as in rejecting it and admitting another, men do
(as much as in them lies) reject and refuse his blessed presence, and deny the
obedience which they ow unto him. Mat. 28.20. Luke 10.16. Ioh. 13.20. 1 Timothy
3.1.15. and 6.3.4.5.13.14. Rev. 2.1. and 3.1. with Lev. 26.11.12.15.16. Deuteronomy.
33.10.11. Isa. 62.6.7.8. Ier. 3.15. Zach. 14.20.21. 2 These. 2.3.4.10.15.16.17.
Rev. 22.18.19.20.

THe Assumption or latter part of the Reason, is proved thus:

The Ministry which Christ has given and set in his Church, is of Apostles,
Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers, spoken of Ephesians. 4.11.12.

But the present Ministry of the Church of England is none of those, spoken
of Ephe. 4.11.12.

Therefore it is not the Ministry which Christ has given and set in his
Church.

The Proposition is plain and undeniable. The Assumption is showed thus:

The present Ministry of the Church of Engl. is of Prelates, Priests, and
Deacons:

But neither the Prelates, Priests, nor Deacons of that Church be Apostles,
Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors or Teachers, spoken of Ephe. 4.11.12.

Therefore the present Ministry of that Church is none of those, spoken of
Ephe. 4.11.12.

The Proposition is manifest by their Law, and constitution. The Law of that
Church establishes not nor admits any other Ministry, but that of their
Prelacy Priesthood and Deaconry, received among themselves or from the Papists.
Their constitution is such, as all the Ministers of that Church must be Priests
or Deacons. And these also either in a superior degree, as the Prelates, the
Lordbishops, Archbs, Suffraganes, etc. or in an inferior, as the Parsons,
Vicars, Stipendaries, Chapleynes, etc.

The Assumption is thus proved:

And first concerning the three first spoken of Ephe. 4.11.

The offices of the Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists, were extraordinary and
the chiefest appointed by christ, for special imployme^t, in laying the
foundation of the christian church and religion through the world, preaching
the Gospel every where, erecting the kingdom of God in all nations, opening and
foretelling the things revealed unto them by the holy Ghost, planting the
Primitive Churches, and settling them in the faith and ordinance of Jesus Christ
which should continue to the end of the world, etc.

But such are not the offices of the Prelates, Priests, or Deacons of the
Church of England.

Therefore they are not the Apostles, Prophets, or Evangelists, spoken of Ephe.
4.11.

More particularly:

The Apostles spoken of Ephe. 4.11. were such, as every one of them had and
were to have these properties, That with their eyes they had seen the L. Jesus,
1 Ioh. 1.1. 1 Cor. 9.1. and 15.7.8.9. Act. 10.39.40.41. That by him immediately
they were appointed to that office, Mat. 28.18.19. Act. 1.2.24 25.26. with
Prove. 16.33. Gal. 1.1. That of him (and not of man) they received the doctrine
and commandments which they delivered to the Churches, Mat. 28.20. Act. 1.2.
and 4.13. Gal. 1.12. and 2.6. etc. That they were sent into the whole world to
preach the Gospel to every creature, to the Jews and Gentiles of all nations,
Mat. 28.19.20. Mar. 16.15. Romans 15.19. Act. 9.15. and 13. and 14 chap. etc.
That as Maister-builders they laid the foundation which should always continue
to the end, Math. 28.19.20. with 1 Cor. 3.10.11. Ephe. 2.20. and 4.11.12.13.
Rev. 21.14. That they should all be of equal authority, Mat. 20.25.26.27. 2
Cor 12.11. Gal. 2.9. Rev. 21.14. That they were filled with the gifts of the
holy Ghost, with variety of tongues, ability to prophecy, power to work
miracles, and to show undoubted arguments of their Apostleship, etc. Act. 2.
and 3. and 4. and 5. chapter etc. with Ioh. 16.13 and 20.21.22. 1 Cor. 14.18. and 2
Cor. 12.11.12.

But such are not the Prelates Priests or Deacons in the Church of England.

Therefore they are not the Apostles, spoken of Ephe. 4.11. And Paul says, that
God set forth him and Barnabas the last Apostles, appointed to death, etc. 1
Cor. 4.9. If they were the last, how shall we now look for any mo after them? Or
if any will yet so think of themselves or others, we may be sure the trial of
them by the word of God will evince them to be such as the Church of Ephesus
found to be liars, which said they were Apostles, but were not to in deed. Rev.
2.2.

The Prophets, spoken of Ephe. 4.11. were such as (with the Apostles) had the
Gospel revealed unto them by the Spirit, and delivered it for the foundation of
the Christian Churches and religion, and by special revelation opened and
applied the Scriptures of the former Prophets, and in weighty cases foretold
things to come, as by the holy Ghost was showed unto them. Ephesians. 3.5. and
2.20. with 4.11. 12. 1 Cor. 12.28. Act. 11.28. and 21.10.11.

But such are not the Prelates Priests or Deacons of the Church of England.

Therefore they are not the Prophets, spoken of Ephe. 4.11.

The Evangelists, spoken of Ephe. 4.11. were such as having appointment and
direction by the Spirit or the Apostles, preached the Gospel abroad, and
brought the Churches to a settled estate, according to the order prescribed them
by the Apostles, whose companions and assistants they were, going whither they
sent them, and returning whither they would have them. Act. 21.8. with chap.
8.5.12.26 29.30.35.39.40. 2 Timothy 4.5.9.10.11. with Romans 16.21. 1 Cor. 4.17. and
16.10. 2 Cor. 1.1.19. Phil. 2.19.22. 1 These. 3.2.6. 1 Timothy 1.2.3. etc. and with
Act. 16.1.3, and 17.14.15. and 18.5. and 19.22. and 20.4. Col. 4.10.11. with
Act. 15.39.40. Tit. 1.4.5. and 3.12. with 2 Cor. 8.23.

But such are not the Prelates Priests or Deacons of the Church of England.

Therefore they are not the Evangelists, spoken of Ephe. 4.11.

The Propositions of these particular reasons are evident by the scriptures
annexed unto them.

The Assumptions are so plain as they need no proof at all. And if any would
deny them, they are bound themselves to show the contrary by the Scriptures:
Which none can ever do.

Now as the Prelates Priests and Deacons of the church of England are not
Apostles, Prophets, or Evangelists, spoken of Ephe. 4.11. so neither are they
Pastors or Teachers there spoken of by the Apostle. Which now we will also prove.

But first (for further clearing of the truth and better discerning of their
estate) it is to be observed here, that albeit themselves take it for granted
that they have these offices in their Church, yet they neither have agreed nor
can agree among themselves who they be that have them; whether the prelates, or
the other priests, etc. but are at a great jarre and in deed at a plain
contradiction among themselves hereabout. Many of the Prelates and Formalists
say, Bridges, Bilson etc.
that their Archbishops and Bishops are Pastors and Teachers; Some of them say,
Whitgift against T.C. p. 137. Andr. in the 2. Confer. with M. Barrow.
that a Bishop is superior both in office and gifts to a Pastor. Many of the
Reformists say, that Mr. Sperin; M. Egerton, in the Confer. M. Hilders. M.
Jacob, in their writings.
the learned and painful Parsons of Parishes and Lecturing preachers among them
are Pastors and Teachers; Others of them say, Mr. Chaderton in the Sermon on
Romans 12. p. 33. etc. Admon to the Parliam. 1. and 2.
they want Pastors and Teachers and all the offices appointed by Christ to his
Church; that the Prelates rob the Church of of lawful Pastors Elders and
Deacons; that their Parsons, Vicars, Parish Priests, Stipendaries, and the
rest, came from the Pope as out of the Troiane horses belly to the destruction
of Gods kingdom; that they are the Prelates new creatures; and that the Church
of God never knew them. And all the seekers of Reformation have showed to the
Parliament heretofore, that the names and offices of Archbishops, Archdeacons,
Lordbishops, and the rest, are together with their government drawn out of the
Popes shop, and contrary to the Scriptures; that the Parsons, Vicars, Parish --
priests, and Stipendaries, be birds of the same fether; and that ^hey have an
Antichristian hierarchy and popish ordering of Ministers, strange from the
word of God and the use of all well reformed Churches in the world. Thus are
themselves confounded, and thus are their tounges divided. Yet cease they not
still to plead for Baal, and to bring balm for the sore of Babel, which cannot
be healed. Ier. 51.8.9.58.64. with Rev. 18. chap.

And now to proceed, we will show by the Scriptures, that none of the Ministers
of that Church have the office of Pastors or Teachers spoken of by the Apostle,
Ephe. 4.11. which we prove thus:

1. The Pastors and Teachers, spoken of Ephe. 4.11. have their offices,
callings, administration, and maintenance ordained by Christ in his Testament.

But the Prelates Priests and Deacons of the Church of England have not their
offices, callings, ministration and maintenance ordained by Christ in his
Testament.

Therefore the Prelates Priests and Deacons of the church of England are not
Pastors and Teachers, spoken of Ephe. 4.11.

The truth of the Proposition appears by that place of Ephe. 4.8.11.12. and
Romans 12.7.8. Act. 14.23. and 20.^7.28. Heb..5.4. Col. 4.17. 1 These. 5.12.13.14.
1 Pet. 5.^.2.3. Rev. 2. and 3. chap. and 22.18.19. 1 Cor. 4.1.2. and ^.4.5. and
9.14. and 11.23.24.25.26. and 12.28. Gal. 6.^. and throughout the Epistles to
Timothee and Titus: with other ^ike Scriptures.

The truth of the Assumption appears by their constitution and practice,
inasmuch as their offices of Prelacy, Priesthood, and Deaconry; their calling
and entrance according to their Pontifical and Book of consecrating Bishops
and Archbishops and ordering Priests and Deacons, as also that which some of
them pretend to have by the Mr. Hilders. letter sect. 10. Mr. Jacobs comparison
of Marriage and Pastoral calling.

choice acceptance and consent of their people, who stand themselves under
Antichrist, and vnseparated from the world, and are no true visible Churches of
Christ; their ministration by their own and other popish Canons, Articles,
Injunctions, and Book of common prayer; their Maintenance by Tithes, Lordships,
etc. were never ordained by Christ for his Ministry of the Gospel, but
derived from Antichrist and his apostasy, as has been proved The Discovery.

The Refutation of Mr. Giff.

Answ. to Mr. Hilders.

And to Mr. Jacob.

The Apology, etc.


by us in diverse Treatises published heretofore. And if they still be otherwise
minded, it lies upon them to show that Christ in his Testament has appointed
these their offices and things aforesaid for his Ministry. Which none of them
have yet done, nor ever will be able to do.

2. Again, The Ministry of Pastors and Teachers, spoken of Ephe. 4.11. is
the ordinary and perpetual ministry given by Christ to his Church, and such
as the Princes of the earth neither may nor ever shall be able to abolish, seeing
Christ has appointed it to continue to the end of the world. Ephesians.
4.11.12.13. Romans 12.5.7.8. and 13.3. Heb. 12.28. 1 Timothy 3. chap. and 5.17. and
6.13.14. with Mat. 28.20.

But the Prelacy Priesthood and Deaconry of the church of England, is not the
ordinary and perpetual Ministry given by Christ to his Church, but such as
the Princes of the earth may and ought to abolish out of their Dominions. Rev.
17.16. 1 Timothy 2.2. Romans 13.4. with 1 King. 23. ^. etc. Deuteronomy. 12.2.3.4. Psalm.
72.1. etc.

Therefore the Prelacy Priesthood and Deaconry of the Church of England is not
the Ministry of Pastors and Teachers, spoken of Ephe. 4.11.

3. Also, The offices of Pastors and Teachers ordained by Christ in his
Testament, are such as did and could ^tand with and under the offices of
Apostles Prophets and Evangelists, Ephe. 4.11. Act. 15.4.6.22.23. and 20.17.28.
Heb. ^3.7.17.23. Epist. to Tim. and Tit. 1 Pet. 5.1. Rev. 2. and 3. chap.

But the offices of the Prelates Priests and Deacons of ^he Church of England,
are not such as did or could stand ^ith or under the offices of Apostles
Prophets and Evange^^sts. Which if any deny, let them show the contrary ^y the
scriptures. Light has no fellowship with darkness, nor Christ with Antichrist.
[And suppose the Apostles were alive in their persons (as they are in their
writings) and were in England, it were worth the knowing whether they and the
ordinances given by them should give place to the Prelates and their Canons and
constitutions, and whether they should be suffered to preach the Gospel and
minister the Sacraments without acknowledging the Prelates authority,
subscribing to their Articles, wearing of the Surplice, signing with the Cross
in Baptism, etc. for if we look to their Canons of the year, 1603. Can.
6.7.14 30.36.37.50.57.58 etc.
Canons, Laws, practice, and Church-constitutio^, these tell all men plainly,
they must yield unto the^, and that under pain of exco^municatio^ ipso facto,
etc. Not to speak of their imprisoning, and persecuting of such as witness the
truth against them eve^ unto death.]

Therefore they are not the Pastors and Teachers ordained by Christ in his
Testament.

4. Moreover, The offices of true Pastors and Teachers, are by the ordinance of
Christ set in the Church, and employed in the Ministry of the word and
Sacraments and Church government, so as they may not (with their ecclesiastical
functio^s) receiv civil offices and callings, nor take unto them princely
titles and dignityes. Ephe. 4.11.12.13. 1 Pet. 5.1.2.3.4. Romans 12.7.8. 1 Cor.
^2.5.8.28. 1 Timothy 4.13.15.16. 2 Timothy 2.4. Luke 12.14. and 22.25.26.

But the offices of the Prelates Priests and Deacons of the Church of England,
are not so: but by their own constitution are set in that Church, and employed
in the Ministry of the word Sacraments and Church government, so as they may
also (together with their ecclesiastical functions) receive civil offices and
callings, (as to be Justices of peace, County palatines, Lords of the Counsel,
etc.) and take unto them Princely titles and dignityes (as of Grace, Lordship,
etc.). Which al men see and know to be thus.

Therefore they are not true Pastors and Teachers.

5. Again, The Ministry of Christian Pastors and Teachers, stands by the
word and ordinance of Christ, so as al Churches under heaven are bound to
receive and submit thereunto, and to no other whatsoever. Ephesians. 4.11.12.13.
Romans 12.5.6.7.8. 1 Cor. 12.5.28. 1 Timothy 3. chap. and 5.17. and 6.13.14.

But the Prelacy Priesthood and Deaconry of the Church of England stands
only by the authority and Law of man, so as other Churches else where neither
ar nor need to be subject thereunto. Which even themselves of all sorts have
acknowledged. For which, see, Whitgifts Defense in the Preface. The Answer to
the Abstract, page 58. The Admon to the Parliam. The Defense of godly Minist.
The Demonstration, etc.

Therefore their Prelacy Priesthood and Deaconry is not the Ministry of
Christian Pastors and Teachers.

6. Furthermore, The offices of Pastors and Teachers which Christ has
appointed, are such as they which have them must be members of a true visible
Church, and bound to one particular Congregation for the Ministry and
government thereof. Romans 12.4.5.6.7.8. 1 Cor. 12.5.8.12.18. Act. 14.23. and
20.28. Col. 4.17. Heb. 13.17. 1 Pet. 5.1, 2, 3, 4.

But the offices of the Prelates Priests and Deacons of the Church of England
are such as they which have them need not be (neither in their estate can be)
members of a true visible Church, but of a false, nor are bound to one
particular Congregation for the Ministry and government thereof, but the
Prelates are over whole provinces and Dioceses etc. and the other inferior
Priests may have (in that estate) plurality of benefices and ecclesiastical
cures, etc. Which none can deny.

Therefore they are not the Pastors and Teachers which Christ has appointed.

7. Finally, The offices condition and government of Pastors and Teachers,
spoken of Ephe. 4.11. are such as no way empaire the authority Supremacy or
dignity of Kings or any other civil Magistrates, either in civil or
ecclesiastical causes. Ephesians. 4.11, 12. and Romans 12.7, 8. with 13.1. and Tit.
1.5, 9. with 3.1. and 1 Pet. 5.1, 2, 3. with 2.13.14.

But the offices condition and government of the Prelates Priests and Deacons
of the Church of England, are such as do many ways empaire the authority
supremacy and dignity of Kings and all other Magistrates, both in civil and
ecclesiastical causes. And for an instance take these particulars, That the
Prelates will have their presence, voice, and authority to be at Parliaments,
for enacting of Laws and statutes for the common wealth, etc. That they are
rulers of whole Provinces and Dioceses in the ecclesiastical causes thereof;
That in civil estate and government, some of them are above all, and all of
them above some of the Nobles, Justices, and other Magistrates of the land;
That themselves, their Courts, and officers, handle and determine sundry civil
causes and affairs pertaining to the civil Magistracy; That they inflict
civil mulcts and punishments; That in their forbidden times they give licenses
to matry, etc. That the beneficed Priests swear Canonical obedience to the
Prelates; That all the Priests and Deacons are exempt from the Magistrates
jurisdiction in diverse things apperteyning unto them, and answerable only or
chiefly to the Prelates and their Officers, etc.

Therefore they are not the Pastors and Teachers spoken of Ephe. 4.11.

And to this end might diverse other reasons be alleged from particular
consideration of these several offices. As for example, if any for the
Prelates would persuade, that their Archbishops have the Pastors office, then
would it follow that they have but two Pastors in the land, because they have
but two Archbishops. Or if they say, the Lordbishops be Pastors, then have they
but six and twenty or thereabout: and what office then have the Archbishops
above them?

If others say, the Priests (whether Parsons, Vicars, or Stipendaries) be
Pastors, then let them tell us what office their Archbishops and Lordbishops
have among them, seeing Christ has appointed in his Church no ordinary
ecclesiastical office for any one person, greater then the Pastors; nor set
the Pastors one of them above another in any respect of Ministry power or
government, but made them all equal therein. Rev. 2.1.8.12.18. and 3.1.7.14.
with Ephesians. 4.11, 12, 13. Act. 20.17.28. 1 Timothy 5.17. 1 Pet. 5.1, 2, 3, 4. and
Luke 22.24.25, 26, 27.

And thus much is acknowledged and published also by some of themselves, both
heretofore in diverse of their books, and now of late in an Offer of conference
about certain Propositions, which they offer to mainteyne against the
Prelates: Among which are these, namely, Offer of Conference, p. ^.
That the Pastor of a particular Congregation is the highest ordinary
ecclesiastical Officer in any true constituted visible Church of Christ; That
it is the office of every true Pastor to teach and to govern spiritually only
one Church or Congregation immediately under Christ; That it is simply unlawful
for any Pastor under the new Testament to be also a civil Magistrate; That the
Office and calling of Provincial and Diocesan Prelates is contrary to the word
of God; etc.

Furthermore, if any would say, their Deacons have the Pastors office, the same
absurdity follows as in the former: and this moreover, that the works of the
Deacons office are by the Apostles opposed to the work of the Ministry,
wherein the Pastors office is employed. Act. 6.2.3.4. with Ephe. 4.11.12. Romans
12.8.

Likewise if they would say, they have the Teachers office, it would be known
whether it be the Archbishops, Lordbishops, Priests, or Deacons, Parsons,
Vicars, or Stipendaries, that have it among them; and to whom they are adjoined
for the work of Ministry, as Ephe. 4.11.12. Romans 12.7.8.
the Teachers are to Pastors, seeing they have none in the office of Pastors,
spoken of Ephe. 4.11. as is proved here before; and what office of Ministry
the rest of their Prelates Priests and Deacons have whom themselves account not
to have the Teachers office; and whether the Teachers spoken of Ephesians. 4.11.
must first be Deacons, and then Priests, and promise obedience to the Prelates,
and that also as to their Ordinaries, and be silenced and deposed at their
pleasure, etc.

But of these things we have spoken in other Treatises, to which we refer the
Reader. Refut. of Mr. Giff. page 104.105.106. etc. Answ. to Mr Hilders. page
79.80-87-94. etc. Answ. to Mr. Jacob. page 188. etc.

Now whereas some allege, for warrant of hearing these Ministers, that the
people were to hearken to the Scribes and Pharisees sitting in Moses seat, etc.
Math. 23.2.3. it is to be noted, that they were Levites, Priests, expounders of
the Law, and Judges of the pleas and controversies of Israel; And therefore had
the true offices and ordinances, which the Lord by Moses did appoint for
teaching and governing of that Church: as appears both by the phrase it self
of sitting on Moses chair, and by conference of these and the like Scriptures,
Deuteronomy. 10.8. and 17.8, -- 12. and 33.1. 8.10. 2 Chronicles. 17.8.9. and 19. 8, -- 11.
Nehem. 8.4, 8. and 9.3.4. 5. with Mat. 22.34.35.41. and 23. chap. Mar.
12.28.32.35. Ioh. 1.19.24. and 3.1.10. Act. 5.34. This then is nothing at all
for any false Ministry, never ordained by the Lord: such as the present
Ministry of the Church of England is proved to be.

Besides, to be a Pharisee, was not to have a new kind of Ministry, but to be
of a special sect among the Jews that pretended more strict observation of
the Law then others did. Act. 15.5. and 26.5. And they were of any of their
tribes, or of the proselyte Gentiles: as may be seen in Paul, who was a
Pharisee, of the tribe of Benjamin, Phil. 3.5. Act. 23. 6. and in them that
were sent to John Baptist, who were Pharisees of the tribe of Levi, being
Priests and Levites, Ioh. 1.19.24. and in the Proselyte Gentiles, brought so to
be by the Scribes and Pharisees, spoken of Mat. 23.15.

And further, although they were very corrupt and ungodly (notwithstanding all
the pretense they made) so as Christ taught his disciples Mat. 16.6.12. and 23.
chap. Luk 12.1.
to take heed of the leven of their doctrine, and of their hypocrisy, and
wickedness in conversation: yet did they still hold, that every true Ministry
must be from heaven and not of men, and urged John the Baptist to warrant his
calling and Ministry by the Scriptures: Luke 20.1-7. with Ioh. 1.19. -- 27.
So far were they themselves from admitting any false ministry, not appointed
by God and approved in his word.

And this also have the forward preachers acknowledged and proved heretofore
against the Prelates: as appears by their own words, saying, T. C. first
reply page 83.
The ministry is by the word of God and heavenly, and not left to the will of
men to devise at their pleasure: as appears by that which is noted of John,
where the Pharisees coming to John Baptist, after that he had denied to be
either Christ, or Elias, or another Prophet, Ioh. 1.23.
conclude: If thou be neither Christ, nor Elias, nor of the Prophets, why
baptizest thou? Which had been no good argument, if S. John might have been of
some other function then of those which were ordinary in the Church and
instituted of God. And therefore he to establish his singular and
extraordinary function, alleges the word of God: whereby appears, that as
it was not lawful to bring in any strange dostrine, so was it Note.
not lawful to teach the true doctrine, under the name of any other function
then was instituted by God. Let the whole practice of the Church under the Law
be looked upon, and it shall not be found that any other ecclesiastical
ministry was appointed, then those orders of hy priests and Levites etc. which
were appointed by the law of God. And if there were any raised up
extraordinarily, the same had their calling confirmed from heaven, either by
signs or miracles, or by plain and clear testimonies of the mouth of God, or
by extraordinary exciting and movings of the Spirit of God. So that it
appears that the ministry of the Gospel and the functions thereof ought to
be from heaven and of God, and not invented by the brain of men.

Thus have themselves written heretofore: and thus does their own testimony
agree with the word of God against their present estate and their woonted
allegations for their continuing therein. But of these things also we have
spoken other where: and will not here further prosecute them. Treatise of the
Minist. of Engl. p. 54.55. etc. Answ. to Mr. Jacob. p. 195.

The conclusion of all is this, that seeing the Lord himself, ascending up on
high, has given offices of Ministry to his Church, calling and requiring all
his people to hear and have spiritual communion with them, and not with any
other; and seeing the present ministry of the Church Assemblies of England
cannot be warranted by the word of God to be that which Christ has given, and
set in his Church, for the work of his Ministry, we may not therefore in the
worship of God hear or communicate therewith, under any color whatsoever.

The second Reason.
NOne may hear or have any spiritual communion with the Ministry of
Antichrists apostasy: But the present Ministry of the Church Assemblies of
England is the Ministry of Antichrists apostasy: Therefore none may hear or
have any spirtual communion with the present Ministry of the
Church Assemblies of Engl.
THe Proposition or first part of this Reason is manifest: 1. Because all false
Ministeries are forbidden by the Lord, and stand under the denunciation of his
curse: Exodus 20.4.5. with Deuteronomy. 18.9-15. 2 Kings 10.19-25. 2 Chronicles. 13.9.10.11.
Zach. 13.2-6. 2 Thessalonians. 2.3-12. Rev. 9. and 17. chap. 2 John. ver. 7.10. Deuteronomy.
7.26. and 27.26. Gal. 1.8.9. Rev. 22.18.19.

2. Because we are commanded to go out of Babylon, and not to partake with any
of her sins, and therefore not with the Ministry of Antichrists apostasy,
Rev. 18.4.5.6. with Ier. 51.6.9.45. 2 Cor. 6.14-17. 1 John 4.1-6.

3. Because by hearing and communicating with such a Ministry, all that do
so, become the servants of Antichrist, as it is written, His servants ye are to
whom ye obey, and thus become subject to the wrath of God: Romans 6.16. 2 Pet.
2.19. with Rev. 14.9.10.11.

4. Because to hear or join with that Ministry, is to honor and conspire
with Antichrist against Christ, and what in us us lies to uphold that which
the Lord will consume. 2 These. 2.3.4.8. Rev. 13. and 14.9-12. and 18.4.5.6.

5. Because this is not to obey the Gospel and receive the love of the truth
that we may be saved, but to provoke the Lord to send us strong delusions to
beleev lies and please our selves in unrighteousness, being carried away in the
deceitfulnes thereof among them that perish, unto condemnation. For thus the
scripture speaks of such as in religion yield submission to Antichrist the
man of sin in his apostasy. 2 These. 2.3.9.10.11.12. Rev. 14.6-12. and
22.18.19.

THe Assumption or second part of the Reason is proved by diverse Arguments, as
follows.

The first Argument.
I.
THe Ministry of Deacons and Priests ordained by the Prelates thereunto, is
the Ministry of Antichrists apostasy: But the present Ministry of the
Church Assemblies of Engl. is the Ministry of Deacons and Priests ordained by
the Prelates thereunto: Therefore the present Ministry of the
Church Assemblies of England is the Ministry of Antichrists apostasy.
The Proposition of this Argument is proved first thus:

1. The Ministry of Deacons and Priests which accounts it self to be Christ's,
and yet was not set by Christ in his Church for the work of his Ministry, that
is the Ministry of Antichrists apostasy:

But the Ministry of Deacons and Priests ordained by the Prelates thereunto,
accounts it self to be Christ's, and yet was not set by Christ in his Church for
the work of his Ministry:

Therefore the Ministry of Deacons and Priests ordained by the Prelates
thereunto, is the Ministry of Antichrists Apostasy.

The Proposition none can deny.

The Assumption has two parts: The one, that the Ministry of Deacons and
Priests ordained by the Prelates thereunto, accounts it self to be Christ's
Ministry: Which themselves will grant. The other, that this was not set by
Christ in his Church for the work of his Ministry: Which is proved already in
the first Reason here before, and in other Reasons hereafter following.

Again, the Proposition of the Argument is proved secondly thus:

2. If the Prelates of the Church of Engl. have such offices and government, as
be special parts of Antichrists apostasy, then the Ministry ordained by them
thereunto, must needs be the Ministry of that Apostasy:

But the Prelates of the Church of Engl. have such offices and government, as
be special parts of Antichrists apostasy:

Therefore the Ministry ordained by them is the Ministry of Antichrists
apostasy.

The consequence of the Proposition is manifest, because the fruit musts needs
be such as is the tree: Neither do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of
thistles. Mat. 7.16.17.18. And who can bring a clean thing out of filthynes?
Not any one. Job. 14.4.

The Assumption is proved first thus:

1. Whosoever (besides Christ Jesus himself) have such offices and government
as thereby they claim to be spiritual Lords, they have the offices and
government which are special parts of Antichrists apostasy, and are indeed
very Antichrists themselves:

But the Prelates of the Church of Engl. have such offices and government as
thereby they claim to be spiritual Lords:

Therefore the Prelates of the Church of Engl. have the offices and government,
which are special parts of Antichrists apostasy, and are indeed very
Antichrists themselves.

The Proposition is proved by the Scriptures, which teach that there is but one
Lord, the Lord Jesus Christ: Ephe. 4.5. 1 Cor. 8.6. and 12.5. 2 Cor. 3.17.18.
with Psalm. 110.1. Micah, 5.2. Luke 19.12.13.14.27. Ioh. 20.22.23. 1 Cor. 11.23.
and 14.37. Rev. 1.11.12.13. and 2.1. and 3.1.7. Now that these Scriptures and
the like do speak of a spiritual Lord, is plain both by the circumstances of
the places themselves, and because the Scripture other where gives allowance
of many civil or temporal Lords, but no where of any spiritual Lord, save
Jesus Christ alone, whose kingdom is not of this world. Genesis 40.1. and 45.8. 1 Samuel 16.16. and 26.17. 1 King. 1.11. Psalm. 149 8. Dan. 3.2. Act. 25.26. and
26.25 Romans 13.1. 1 Cor. 1.26 and 2.8. Tit. 3.1. 1 Pet. 2.5.13.14. Rev. 17.14.
and 19.16. compared with the Scriptures here cited before. And moreover,
whosoever is a spiritual Lord, he may require spiritual honor to be yielded
unto him, and has the Spirit of God to give unto his people, and through
himself by it can sanctify them and their actions and service of his Name,
etc. Which things who is there that can require and effect, but only the Lord
himself? And who then can be a spiritual Lord, but he alone? So as hereby also
it appears, that all other which take upon them to be spiritual Lords, are
indeed very Antichrists.

The Assumption is proved by the Laws and Statutes of the Land, whose words be
these, Be it enacted by the Kings most excellent Majesty, the Lords Spiritual
and Temporal, and the commons in this present Parliament assembled: For by the
Lords spiritual is meant here the Prelates. And to the same end it is to be
observed, that in their Canons and practice they take upon them, as if they
were spiritual Lords, not only to prescribe their own ordinances to the
Church for the worship of God, but also to bynd the spirit and conscience to
the acknowledgment and approbation thereof; and yet further in their ordination
of Priests even to give the holy Ghost, saying to the Priests when they ordeyne
them, Receive the holy Ghost, etc. as if it were in their power to give the
Spirit of God to whom they would, or that they were authorized hereunto by
Jesus Christ, who only is the spiritual Lord of his Church, and gives his
spirit according to his own will, to whom and as it pleases him. Ioh. 1.14.16.
and 15.26. and 20.22. 1 Cor. 12.4.5.6.7. Ephe. 4.7.1 Ioh. 2.20.27.

The Assumption aforesaid is proved secondly thus:

2. The offices and government of such Bishops as are over Diocesan and
Provincial Churches, and exercise ecclesiastical jurisdiction over all the
Ministers and people therein, are special parts of Antichrists apostasy:

But the Prelates of the Church of Engl. have the offices and government of
such Bishops as are over Diocesan and Provincial Churches, and exercise
ecclesiastical jurisdiction over all the Ministers and people therein:

Therefore the Prelates of the Church of Engl. have such offices and government,
as be special parts of Antichrists apostasy.

The Proposition is evident, inasmuch as the offices and government of such
Bishops, and subjection of such Ministers and Churches, are only to be found
in Antichrists apostasy, and were never appointed by Christ or his Apostles.
For now in the time of the Gospel, Christ has set no other form of visible
Churches to which he has given offices of Ministry, but only particular
congregations, such as may come together in one, and jointly perform all
public duties laid upon them by the word of God. As may appear by the
constitution of Act. 1.15. and 2.41.42. with 6.2.3.5 6. and 11.22. and
15.22.23. and 21.17 18.22. And 13.1.2. and 14.23. and 16 4.5. and 20.17.28. And
the epistles to the Romans Cor. Gal. Ephe. Phil. Col. These. etc.
all the Churches planted by the Apostles, and written unto by them in so many
several epistles: also by the Churches to whom Christ wrote by John in the
Revelation, Rev. 1.11. with 2. and 3. chap. Other forms of Churches therefore
no men have power to institute. And when and where they are erected, what other
can they be but Antichristian?

And as for the examples of Timothee, Titus, and the like, usually alleged for
defense of the Prelates authority and jurisdiction, they will nothing help
them. For these were Evangelists, which the Prelates are not: as we have showed
in the Page 5.
former Reason. And the particular Churches have in themselves each of them full
interest and power from Christ to enjoy and practice all his ordinances, for
Ministry, worship, government, and whatsoever he has given his Church to be
observed therein to the end of the world. Mat. 18.17-20. and 28.20. with Act.
6.3-6. and 14.23. and 20.17.28. Romans 12.4-8. 1 Cor. 3.21.22.23. and 4.17. and
5.4.11.12. and 11.2.23.24.25.26. and 12.27. and 14.33.36. and 16.1. 1 Timothy
3.15. and 6.13.14. Rev. 1.11. 20. with 2. and 3. chap.

And whereas the extraordinary offices of Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists,
are ceased; yet Ioh. 15.16. The Acts and Epistles of the Apostles. etc.
their fruit remains still: and we have the benefit of it for our direction
by their writings, which the Churches then had by their bodily presence. To
which end may be observed also, how 1 Cor. 1.1. Phil. 1.1. Col. 1.1. Philem.
ver. 1.
some of the epistles are written in the Name of Paul, and Timothee (an
Apostle, and an Evangelist); and 1 These. 1.1. and 2 These. 1.1
some of them in the Name of Paul, Silvanus, and Timothee ( 1 Cor. 4.9. 1 Timothy
2.7.
an Apostle, Silvanus being the same with Silas, as is like by the Name, the
placing of the^, and the history, Act. 15.32.40. and 16.19. and 17.4.10.14.15.
and 18.5.
a Prophet, and an 2 Timothy 4.5.
Evangelist): which three also are joined together for the constant teaching of
one and the same truth in Christ, 2 Cor. 1.19. And withal, that the Apostles
did then so write and mind, as purposely intending the instructions and
commandments given by them should be observed of all Churches, both of the
Ministers and other members thereof according to their places, to the end of
the world. ( Ro^. 12.3-8. and 15.4. 1 Cor. 4.6.17. and 11.23-26. and 14.37.
Gal. 1.8.9. and 6.16.17. Ephe. 3 chap. and 4.11.12.13. Col. 1.23-29. and 2.1.2.
and 4.16.17. 2 These. 2.15. 1 Timothy 3.14.15. and 5.21. and 6.3.5.13.14. and 2 Timothy 2.2. and 3.1.15.16.17. and 4.5.6. Titus Epist. Heb. 2.1-4. and 3.1-6. and
13.8. 1 Pet. 5.12. 2 Pet. 1.12-21. and 2.1. and 3.1.2.3.15.16. 1 Ioh.
2.1.12.13.14. and 4.1-6. Jude, ver. 3.17.18.19.20.21. Rev. 1.3. and 2. and 3.
chap. and 22.18.19.20.) So as now there can be no need or lawful use of any
Diocesan, Provincial, National, or Universal Bishops.

And for any reason or proof that the Prelates or any for them have brought or
can bring from the Scripture for their Prelacy, it will as well follow that as
they have now their Bishops over Dioceses, and Archbishops over Provinces; so
if the King would, he might have a Primate or Archprelate over all his
Dominions; and if there were a Monarch over Europe, he might have a Patriarch
over all the Prelates therein; and so an Emperor over the world (if there were
any) might also have an Oecumenicall or Universal Bishop and Pope over all the
rest.

And Timothees example would as well warrant these, as it will the other: seeing
there was not any Church in the world, whither his office and the duties thereof
might not extend, as his calling and employment was. Of whom the Scripture
shows, that he was, and did the duties of his office, sometimes in one part
of the world, and sometimes in another, sometimes in Asia, and sometimes in
Europe: as may be seen by the countries where he was at sundry times: As in
Asia, being in diverse countries and parts thereof, in Phrygia, Galatia, Mysia,
Ionia, etc. And in Europe likewise, in Macedonia, Achaia, Italy, etc. And in
these countries and nations, sometimes in one city and with one church, and
sometimes with another, as namely, at Thessalonica, at Athens, at Corinth, at
Ephesus, at Rome, at Philippi, etc. Also sometimes being with the Apostle Paul
where he was himself, sometimes left behind him when he went other whither,
sometimes sent for to come unto him to such place as he appointed, somtymes
sent away from him to other places where he would employ him, etc. And this,
sometimes to bring the Churches into a settled order according to the Apostles
direction, sometimes to stablish and comfort them being already in such estate,
sometimes to know their state, and to put them in remembrance of the Apostles
ways, sometimes to look that none taught otherwise, but that the doctrine and
order delivered by the Apostles were retained among them, etc. By all which
appears, both what the office and employment of an Evangelist was, and that
Timothee was not a Bishop in ordinary office, perteyning to any one certain
place and people, but an Evangelist in extraoadinary function, employed
sometimes in one country and part of the world, and sometimes in another,
sometimes with one Church and people, and sometimes with another, according as
he had direction and appointment by the Apostle Paul, whose companion and
assistant he was. For all which, see these Scriptures, Act. 16. chap. and
17.14.15. and 18.5. and 19.22. and 20.4. Romans 16.21. 1 Cor. 4.17. and 16.10.11.
2 Cor. 1.19. Phil. 1.1. and 2.19.22.23. 1 These. 3.1.2.6. with both the Epistles
written by Paul unto Timothee.

The like may be observed concerning Titus, who was sometimes with the Apostle
Paul himself, sometimes left behind him when he departed other whither,
sometimes called unto him, sometimes sent away from him, etc. being thus
sometimes in Europe, sometimes in Asia: And in Europe being also at diverse
places, as at Corinth in Achaia; at Rome in Italy; in Creta; Dalmatia, etc.
And in Asia likewise, at Jerusalem in Judea, at Nicopolis in Armenia, etc. As
appears by these Scriptures, 2 Cor. 8.23.24. and 12.18. Gal. 2.1. 2 Timothy
4.10. Tit. 1.4.5. and 3.12. with the whole Epistle to Titus. And the like may
be seen also in Marcus, Aristarchus, Tychicus, and others, whose examples they
might as well allege as those of Timothee and Titus. Act. 12.25. and 13.5. and
15.37.39. and 20.4.5. and 27. 2. Ephe. 6.21.22. Col. 4.7.8.10.11. 2 Timothy
4.11.12. Tit. 3.12. Philem. ver 24.

But by such allegations they let all men know how near they are driven, that
can find no warrant in the Scripture for Diocesan and Provincial Bishops, and
therefore are glad to lay hold on the Evangelists office in Timothee and Titus:
from which notwithstanding they and their Churches and Ministers are as far as
cloudy darkness is from the clear light of the Sun. For the further declaration
whereof, besides that which has been said here before and in other Treatises
written of this argument, I will by way of question propound some things to be
considered by such as are of judgment, which as they shall be found may give
more light to these and other points sometimes called in question. The things
are these:

1. Whether the ordinance of Christ be not such, as therein they which be in
the greater offices, have (besides their own peculiar function whereunto they
ought to attend) power and authority both themselves to perform the duties of
any the inferior offices, when there is just and needful occasion, and to
look that they be performed by all such as they are specially laid upon, for
the better service of the Lord and his church therein.

2. Whether on the contrary, the apostasy of Antichrist be not such (touching
the Ministry and government of the Church) as therein they which be in the
lesser offices have power and authority among them to exceed the duties of the
office which Christ has appointed, and to perform the duties apperteyning to
the higher offices: by means whereof both Antichrist has risen up to so great
a height, and so many orders and degrees of superior and inferior Ministers
have been received and still are retained in that degenerate estate and
apostasy of the man of sin, as is come to pass.

And touching the first, because the offices set by Christ in his Church be of
two sorts, some extraordinary and for a time and special use, some ordinary
and prrpetual: whether it be true in both, or in the first, and in them alone.
As for example, That the Apostles, who were in the greatest office ordained by
Christ under the Gospel, Mat. 28.18.19.20. Ephe. 4.11.12. 1 Cor. 12.28.
had (besides the peculiar office of Apostleship) the power also and authority
of the other Offices of Act. 20.29.30 Ro^. 11.25.26. 2 These. 2.3-8. 1 Timothy
4.1.2.3. ^ Pet. 2. and 3. chap. 1 Ioh. 2.18. Jude, ver. 17.18.
Prophets, Act. 8.14.25. and 14.7. and 15.35.36 41. and 16.40. Romans 1.11.12.15.
Evangelists, Ioh. 21.16. Act. 1.40.42. and 20.2. 1 Cor. 9.7.
Pastors, Act. 5 42. 1 Timothy 2.7. 2 Timothy 1.11.
Teachers, 1 Pet. 5.1. Act. 6.2.6. and 15.6.22. 1 Timothy 4.14. with 2 Timothy, 1.6.
Elders and Act. 4.34.35. and 6.2.3 4. and 11.29.30. 1 Cor. 16.3.4. Gal. 2.10.
Deacons, both to perform them upon just occasion themselves, and to see the^
performed by others as is aforesaid; For which, consider the Scriptures here
quoted in the Margent.

And likewise, that the Prophets (besides their own special office) had in
them the power and authority of the other inferior offices of Evangelists,
Pastors, Teachers, etc. Act. 15.32.40.41. and 17.15. and 18.5.2. Cor. 1.19.
Ephe. 3.5.6. and 4.11.12.

And in like sort, that the Evangelists (besides their own peculiar function)
had in them the power and authority of the other smaller offices of Pastors,
Teachers, Elders, etc. Act. 8.35.38. with 21.8. 1 Cor. 16.10. 2 Cor. 1.19. and
8.6.16.17.23. 1 These. 3.2. with the Epist. to Tim. and Tit.

And, it being so in the ordinary offices likewise, that the Pastors therefore
(besides their own peculiar function) have in them the power and authority of
the other ordinary offices of the Teachers, Elders, and Deacons, for
performance and oversight as is aforesaid. Act. 20.28. Ephe. 4.11.12. 1 Timothy
3.1-15. and 5.17.22. with 6.13.14. Heb. 13.7.17. 1 Pet. 5.1, 2.3.4. Luke 12.42.
Rev. 1.20. with 2.1.8.12.18. and 3.1.7.14.

Likewise that the Teachers have in them (besides their own special office)
the power and authority of the ruling Elders and Deacons. Act. 20.28. 1 Cor.
3.8.9.10. and 12.8.12.28. Ephe 4.11.12. 1 Timothy 3.1. -- 15. and 5.17. with 2 Timothy 2.2. Tit. 1.5-9. Heb. 13.7.17.

And in like manner, that the Elders (besides their own special function) have
in the^ the power and authority of the Deacons office, for the doing and
overseing thereof as before is spoken. Act. 11.29.30. and 20.17, 28. 1 These.
5.12.13.14. 1 Timothy 3.1-15. and 5.17-22. with 6.13.14. Heb. 13.17. 1 Pet.
5.1.2.3.4.

Finally, that the Deacons, as also the rest aforesaid, have (besides their
own peculiar office) right and power to enjoy whatsoever interest the other
members have in the Church, for any duties or actions to be performed therein,
according to their place and condition. And further, that when they shall have
ministered well in the Deacons office, they may be called before other of the
brethren into the higher offices of the Elders, being endued with gifts
thereunto. Act. 6.3. Romans 12.4-8. 1 Cor. 12.12-28. 1 Timothy 3.8-13.

But now on the contrary, when such as were in the inferior offices, contained
not themselves within compass of their callings, but took upon themselves or
had laid upon them by others power and authority of the superior functions,
then sprung up the apostasy of Antichrist in the churches ministry and
government. As namely, when the Pastors and Bishops of particular congregations
came to have authority and oversight over many Churches and over the Ministers
and people therein, in a kind of resemblance of the extraordinary offices
already ceased: Contrary to Rev. 1.11.12.13.20. with 2.1.8.12 18. and
3.1.7.14. Act. 20.28. Ephe. 4.11.12.13. Phil. 1.1. 1 Pet. 5.1.2.3.4. And that
the ruling Elders or Presbyters (now called Priests) did the Ministerial
duties of the Pastors and Teachers in the particular Congregations: Contrary to
Romans 12.7.8. 1 Cor. 12.28. 1 Timothy 5.17. And that the Deacons also baptized, and
were Ministers of the word; which the Apostles did purposely oppose to the
duties of that office at the institution thereof. Act. 6.2.3.4. So as of these
things it may be said, as Christ did in another case, From the beginning it was
not so. Mat. 19.8.

And hereupon in time many sorts and degrees of inferior servile Ministers and
superior Lordly Prelates grew up and increased in that defection of the Man of
sin, till Antichrist at the length was exalted in his throne. From which now
again the Lord has begun to bring him down, discovering and consuming that
mystery of iniquity by the light and power of his Gospel: and will not cease,
till the same be fully abolished and cast into the bottomless pit, from whence
it first arose. 2 These. 2.3.4.7.8.9 10.11.12. and 1 Ioh. 2.18.19. with Rev.
6.12.13.14. and 8. and 9. and 13. and 14. and 16. and 17. and 18. and 19. chap.
And hitherto of the Proposition of the last Syllogism.

The Assumption thereof (namely, that the Prelates of the Church of Engl. have
the offices and government of such Bishops as are over Diocesan and Provincial
Churches, and exercise ecclesiastical jurisdiction over all the Ministers and
people therein) is evident by their Church-constitution, Laws, and practice.
And themselves neither will nor can deny it.

3. The other Assumption aforesaid (viz, that the Prelates of the Church of
Engl. have such offices and government, as be special parts of Antichrists
apostasy) is proved thirdly by this, that the offices and government of the
Prelates of the Church of Engl. do not in their nature and proper use perteyne
to any society body and estate, either civil or ecclesiastical, but only to
the body and kingdom of Antichrist. Of which, as also of other reasons proving
the point in hand, more shall be spoken hereafter in the several Arguments
following concerning this matter. And thus much concerning the Proposition of
this Argument.

The Assumption of the Argument (namely, that the present Ministry of the
Church Assemblies of England is the Ministry of Deacons and Priests ordained
by the Prelates thereunto) is undeniably confirmed by the constitution, Canons,
and observation of that Church. And to the end that this point may the better
be considered, and because it gives great light and proof to the whole
controversy concerning the Antichristianity of their estate, I will here note a
few special things, which (among many other apperteyning to their office and
calling) may to this purpose be observed.

First for their Deacons, they are at their entrance into that office presented
to the Prelate by an Archdeacon or his deputy, saying, Reverend father in God,
I present unto you these persons present, to be admitted Deacons.

2. Then the Bishop commending them to the prayers of the Congregation, with
the Clerks and people present, is to say or sing the Letanie and Suffrages,
with the communion of the day, and a number of stinted prayers and Collects,
borrowed from the Papists.

3. They promise that they will reverently obey their Ordinary, and other chief
Ministers of the Church, that is, the Lord Bishop of the Dioces, the
Archbishop, Archdeacon, Chancellor, Commissarie, and the rest of that sort,
whose offices are Antichristian.

4. After this promise made, they are then ordained Deacons by the Lord Bishop
or his Suffragane, laying his hands upon their head, and saying, Take thou
authority to execute the office of a Deacon in the Church of God committed unto
thee: in the name of the Father, the son, and the holy Ghost. Amen.

5. And then the Bishop delivers to every one of them the new Testament,
saying, Take thou authority to read the Gospel in the Church of God, and to
preach the same, if thou be thereunto ordinarily commanded.

6. Then one of them appointed by the Bishop, reads the Gospel of that day: And
they al are enjoined to receive the communion with the Bishop.

7. Also among the works and duties of their office, they are appointed to read
Homilies and divine service, to instruct the youth in the Catechism, to
Baptize, and to preach, if they be admitted thereto by the Bishop. Whereas it
cannot be showed that the Apostles ever laid these duties upon the Deacons, but
such as are Act. 6.2.3.4. Romans 12.8.
plainly opposed to the ministry of the word and prayer, namely, the charge
of the poor and Church treasure, for the gathering and distribution of the
Churches benevolence.

Whereupon some of themselves seeking reformation have published heretofore,
that Defense of Eccles. Discip page 102.
their Deaconship is a mere humane institution, a degree to the Priesthood, and
nothing like the ordinance of God; that Admon. to Parliam. first treatise
though the name of Deacons be remaining among them, yet the office is fowly
perverted and turned vpside down; and that Defense of godly Minist page 108.
it is manifestly contrary to the word of God. The example of Philip, who was
one of the seven Deacons, and preached and baptized (which by some is alleged
for approbation of their practice) will not help them. For he was in a true and
lawful office, not in an Antichristian; he had a lawful calling by the Church,
not an unlawful entrance by Prelates, as these have; when and where he was
Deaco^, the Apostles ministered the word and baptized, neither was he then
ordained to the administration thereof, but attended to the tables of the poor;
and afterward when he preached and baptized, he did the work and office of an
Evangelist, by which name the Scripture expressly calls him. Act. 6.2-6. and
2.14.40.41.42. and 21.8. with 8.5, 6, 7.12, 26, 29. etc.

Next, for the Priests, first they must be Deacons, that is, set by the
Prelates in the office and after the manner aforesaid.

2. Then having continued in that office the space of a year (except it seem
otherwise good to the Ordinary) they are again presented to the Bishop or his
Suffragane, by an Archdeacon or his deputy, saying, Reverend father in God, I
present these persons present to be admitted to the Order of Priesthood.

3. Afterward there follows the Letany, and some Collects and stinted prayers
taken out of the Popes pontifical: with an exhortation, an Epistle and
Gospel, wherein they abuse and pervert the Scripture.

4. Then the Prelate asks them, Do you think in your heart that you be truly
called according to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the order of this
Church of England, to the Ministry of Priesthood? And the parties that are to
be ordained, answer, every one for himself, I think it.

5. At which time also they promise again, reverently to obey their Ordinary
and other chief Ministers of the Church, that is the Prelates and other
Officers aforesaid.

6. So after a few questions made, and prayers read, they kneel down upon
their knees at the Prelates feet, and he with the Priests present lay hands
severally upon the head of every one of them that receives orders, saying unto
them, Receive the holy Ghost, whose sins thou do forgive, they are
forgiven: and whose sins thou do reteyne, they are retained: and be thou a
faithful dispensour of the word of God, and of his holy Sacraments. In the
name of the Father, and of the son, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.

7. And then the Prelate delivers to each of them, the Bible in his hand,
saying, Take thou authority to preach the word of God, and to minister the holy
Sacraments in the congregation, where thou Note, how they may be made Priests,
though yet they have no charge or flock to attend unto.
shall be so appointed.

Thus are they made Priests: and when at any time they enter into a benefice,
they must besides have the Presentation of the Patron (who may be a Papist or
Familist, etc.) and the institution of the Prelate, who is an Antichrist, to
whom now also they swear to yield Canonical obedience; and by whom otherwise
they stand always subject to be silenced, suspended, degraded, and deprived.

And for the works of their calling, some are such as Christ has not
prescribed to his Ministers in his Testament (such as be their solemnization of
marriage, burial of the dead, churching of women, reading of homilies, and
stinted prayers, etc.) and some being such as Christ has prescribed, yet at
they not so administered as he in his word has ordained, but according as is
appointed in their book of Common prayer, and in their Canons, Injunctions,
Advertisements, etc. according to which they are bound to pray, and to
administer the word, Sacraments, and censures, among them.

Other particulars, many and strange, used in the entrance and performance of
their Office of Priesthood, I omit. Only I will annex this one thing more, how
by their Canons they have now provided further and made it a constitution of
their Church, Canons of Anno 1603. Can. 36.
That no person shall be received into the Ministry, nor admitted to any
Ecclesiastical living, nor suffered to preach, except he be licenced by the
Archbishop or Bishop of the Dioces, etc. and except he shall first subscribe,
That the book of Common prayer, and of ordering Bishops, Priests and Deacons,
conteyneth in it nothing contrary to the word of God, and that it may lawfully
so be used, and that he himself will use the form in the said Book prescribed
in public prayer, and administration of the Sacraments, and none other. Also,
That he allows the book of Articles of Religion agreed upon by the
Archbishops and Bishops of both Provinces, and the whole Clergy in the
convocation holden at London in the ye are, 1562. and that he acknowledges all
and every the Articles therein contained, to be agreeable to the word of God.
In which Articles although there be many truths, yet there are also errors not
afew, to which they must subscribe that they are agreeable to the word of God,
and that they do thus subscribe willingly and ex animo.

Lastly, for their Bishops and Archbishops, 1. there is with other things
aforesaid, at their consecration also to be read an Epistle, Gospel, and Credo.

2. After which ended, the elected Bishop must be presented by two Bishops,
unto the Archbishop of that Province, or to some other Bishop appointed by his
Commission, the Bishops that present him saying, Most reverend Father in God,
we present unto you this godly and well learned man, to be consecrated Bishop.

3. Then the Archbishop demands the Kings mandate, for the consecration. And
after a lawful oath concerning the Kings supremacy, they must take an unlawful
oath of obedience to the Archbishop: which is thus, In the name of God, Amen. I
N. chosen Bishop of the Church and Sie of N. do profess and promise all due
reverence and obedience to the Archbishop and to the Metropoliticall Church of
N. and to their successors, so help me God, through Jesus Christ. Which oath
at the consecration of an Archbishop is omitted.

4. Afterward upon the Archbishops demand he answers a number of questions,
1 Of his persuasion that he is truly called to this ministration according to
the will of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the order of the Realm; 2 Of the
sufficiency of the Scriptures, and his determination with them to instruct the
people committed to his charge; 3 Of his study faithfully to exercise himself
in the said Scriptures; 4 Of his readynes with all faithful diligence to
banish and drive a way all erroneous and strange doctrine, contrary to Gods
word; 5 Of his care to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live
soberly, righteously, and godly, in this world. 6. Of his purpose to maynteyne
and set forward quietness, peace, and love among all men, and to correct and
punish such as be unquiet, disobedient, and criminous within his dioces,
according to such authority as he has by Gods word, and the ordinance of the
Realm; 7 Of his carefulnes to show himself gentle, and merciful for Christ's
sake to poor people, and strangers. To all which they answer affirmatively,
and walk for the most part negatively: as their estate and practice shows
unto all men, that will open their eyes to see it.

5. Then must be sung or said, Come holy Ghost, etc. whose direction given in
the Scriptures for the offices and ordinances appointed by Christ they reject,
and follow the Papists and their own devises, so making the commandment of
God of no effect through their traditions.

6. For the consecration it self, the Archbishop and Bishops present, must lay
their hands upon the head of the elected Bishop, the Archbishop saying: Take
the holy Ghost, and remember that thou stir up the grace of God, which is in
thee, by imposition of hands: for God has not given us the spirit of fear,
but of power, and love, and sobernes. Where note again their vayn presumption
and impiety in taking upon them to give the holy Ghost, having no power from
the Lord thereunto. Yet I suppose this consecrated Bishop takes as much as the
Archbishop gives, and the Archbishop gives as much as the Bishop takes: which of
what quantity and quality it is, let their estate and works be witnesses.

7. Then the Archbishop delivers him the Bible, saying: Give heed unto
reading, exhortation, and doctrine: Think upon the things contained in this
book: Be diligent in teaching and doing them, etc. Be to the flock of Christ a
Shepherd, not a wolf, feed them, devour them not, etc. Wherein their practice
is as contrary, as their office is degenerate from the ordinance of Christ.

And thus is their form of consecrating Bishops and Archbishops. Wherein I
omit to note in particular their great abuse and profanation of the Name and
word of God, in the Scriptures and prayers then used, from the beginning to the
end of that their consecration. Neither will I stand to speak of their
administration and government: nor of their other degrees and functions of
Deanes, Prebendaries, Chauncellors, Archdeacons, Commissaries, Officials, and
the rest of that sort among them: seeing there are so many unanswerable
treatises already published of this Argument, concerning the Antichristianity
and unlawfulness of their Offices, callings, works, and maintenance.

Yet before I end this point, I will here set down two of their own late
Canons, and some of the sayings and testimonies both of the Martyrs of old, and
of the seekers of Reformation in this latter age: that so their opposition
against the truth and amongst themselves may by this means yet further appear.

Their Canons are these, 1. Canons of Anno. 1603, Genesis 7.
Whosoever shall affirm, that the government of the Church of England, under
his Majesty by Archbishops, Bishops, Deanes, Archdeacons, and the rest that
bear office in the same, is Antichristian or repugnant to the word of God: let
him be excommunicated ipso facto, and so continue until he repent and publikly
revoke such his wicked errors. 2. And, Ibid. Can. 8.
Whosoever shall affirm or teach, That the form and manner of making and
consecrating Bishops, Priests, or Deacons, conteyneth any thing in it, that is
repugnant to the word of God, or that they who are made Bishops, Priests, or
Deacons in that form are not lawfully made, nor ought to be accounted either
by themselves or by others, to be truly either Bishops, Priests, or Deacons,
until they have some other calling to those divine Offices: let him be
excommunicated ipso facto, not to be restored until he repent and publikly
revoke such his wicked errors. These are their Canons, among many other the
like, by which all may see how earnestly they set themselves to hold up the
falling apostasy of the man of sin, as other before time have labored to
heal the deadly wound of the beast. 2 These. 2.3-12. with Reve. 13.11.12. etc.

The testimonies of the Martyrs to the contrary (which here I will mention) are
these, being of such also as were of our own country. John Claydon (burnt in
Smithfeild at London, in the year, 1415.) held Act. and Monum. Edit^ 5. page
588.
that Archbishops and Bishops, speaking indifferently, are the seats of the
beast Antichrist, when he sits in them and reigns above other people in
the dark caves of errors and heresies. Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham (put to
death about the year, 1417.) witnessed, Ibid. page 518.
that the Bishops, Priests, Prelates, and Monks, are the body of that great
Antichrist. And, that the possessions and Lordships of the Clergy, are the
venime of Judas shed into the Church. William Tindall (burnt by Filford
Castle, in Braband) and John Frith (burnt at London, in Smithfeild) published,
Tindals Obed. of a Christian. And Practice of Prelates. Friths Preface to the
Antithesis between Christ and the Pope.
that Archbishops, Lordbishops, Archdeacons, Deanes, Officials, Parsons,
Vicars, and the rest of that sort, are the disciples of Antichrist, yea very
Antichrists themselves. And John Bale (an exile for the testimony of Jesus) In
his Image of both Churches, upon Rev. 13.^ and 17.3.
wrote, that the names of blasphemy written upon the Beasts head (Rev. 13. and
17.) are none other then the proud glittering titles, wherewith they garnish
their usurped authority, to make it seem glorious to the world, having within
them contained the mystery of iniquity. What other else (says he) is Pope,
Cardinal; Metropolitan, Primate, Archbishop, Diocesan, Archdeacon, Official,
Chancelour, Commissary, Prebend, Parson, Vicar, and such like, but very names
of blasphemy? For offices they are not appointed by the holy Ghost, nor yet
once mentioned in the Scriptures.

The sayings of such as of latter days have sought reformation, which here I
will note down are these: Admon, to the Parliam.
that the names and offices of Archbishops, Lordbishops, Chancelours,
Archdeacons, Co^missaries, Officials, Deanes, Parsons, Vicars, Parish priests,
Stipendaries, etc. are drawn out of the Popes shop as out of the Troiane
horses belly for the destruction of Gods kingdom; That their Pontifical,
whereby they consecrate Bishops, make Ministers and Deacons, is nothing else but
a thing word for word drawn out of the Popes pontifical, wherein he shows
himself to be Antichrist most lively; That they enter not in by Christ, but by
a Popish and unlawful vocation; That when they are made Ministers, either they
may tarry in their College and lead the lives of loytering losels, or else go
abroad with the Bishops Bulls like to Circumcellions or Friars to preach in
other men's charges where they list, or else get benefices by friendship or money,
or if all those fail, they may go up and down like beggars, and fall to many
follyes, or else (as many have done) set up bills at Powles or at the Royal
exchange and such like places, to see if they can hear of some good Masters to
enterteyne them to serve a cure. Thus have they spoken and written heretofore,
when they seemed to loath these stinking abominations (as themselves then
called them) and when they did not bring balm to cure the sore of Babell, as
now many of them do, though all in vain: for she cannot be healed, says the
Lord of hosts. Ier. 51.8.9. And hitherto of the first Argument, proving that
the present Ministry of the Church-assemblyes of England is the Ministry of
Antichrists apostasy.

The second Argument.
THe Ministry of the Prelacy professing it self to be Christ's, II.
and yet standing in such estate as it does not obey Jesus Christ in his own
ordinance of Ministry worship and government of the Church, as their Prophet
Priest and King, that Ministry whatsoever it profess in word, yet is in deed
the Ministry of Antichrists Apostasy. But the present Ministry of the
Church Assemblies of Engl. is the Ministry of the Prelacy professing it self
to be Christ's, and yet standing in such estate as it does not obey Jesus Christ
in his own ordinance of Ministry worship and government of the Church, as
their Prophet Priest and King. Therefore the present ministry of the Church
assemblies of Engl. whatsoever it profess in word, yet is in deed the
Ministry of Antichrists apostasy.
THe truth of the Proposition is manifest: because there is no other Ministry
but Antichrists that stands in such estate. And they are in deed of
Antichrist, that professing the name of Christ, yet refuse to obey him in his
own ordinance of Ministry worship and government of the Church, as their
Prophet Priest and King. As may appear by these Scriptures compared together,
and others the like: Deuteronomy. 18.18.19. Psalm. 110.1.2.3.4. Mat. 15.9. and 17.5.
and 28.20. Luke 19.27. and 22.25.26. Romans 12.3-8. Ephe. 4.8.11.12. 1 Timothy
6.13.14. 1 Pet. 5.1-4. with 2 These. 2.3.4. 1 Timothy 4.1.2.3. 1 John 2.18.19.22.
and 4.3. and 2 Ioh. ver. 7. Rev. 13.11. and 14.9-12. and 22.18.19.

The truth of the Assumption is evident, by that which has been said in the
Reasons Page 2. etc.
here going before. And their constitution it self shows it, in that they are
so far from obeying Jesus Christ in his own ordinance of Ministry worship
and government of the Church, as they do all of them receive execute or stand
subject unto the Ministry and government of another Archbishop and Lordbishop
then Jesus Christ, of an Archeacon, and of a Parson Vicar or Stipendary, being
Priest or Deacon, so ordained by the Prelates: As also in their administration,
reading prayers out of a book, stinted and imposed upon them, and observing
many other inventions of men in the worship of God continually used among them:
And likewise in their Church Government, according to their Canons, Courts,
excommunications, degradations, and other like proceedings, by the Prelates and
their Officers. Which were never appointed by Christ, the Prophet Priest and
King of the Church: as may be seen in his Testament, where they are not to be
found. And this we have showed heretofore more particularly in other Treatises
already published: to which I refer the Reader. Refut. of Mr. Giff. The
Apology against the Oxf. Doct. Treatise of Minist. of the Church of Engl. page
28.29.30. etc.

The third Argument.
III.
THe Ministry of Christians which is opposed against and exalted above the
holy things, Ministry, and ordinances of Jesus Christ, that is the Ministry
of Antichrists apostasy: But the present Ministry of the Church Assemblies
of Engl. is the Ministry of Christians opposed against and exalted above the
holy things Ministry and ordinances of Jesus Christ. Therefore the present
Ministry of the Church Assemblies of Engl. is the Ministry of Antichrists
apostasy.
The first part of the Argument is certain, and manifest by these Scriptures,
2 These. 2.3.4. with 1 Ioh. 2.18.19. and 4.1.2.3. and Rev. 9. and 13. and 14.
and 17. and 18. chap.

The truth of the second part of the Argument appears evidently: 1. In this,
that a man may peaceably administer or receive their holy things, in their
manner, by virtue of their Deaconry or Priesthood received from the Prelates;
which is the present Ministry of that Church, as has been showed before. But
if any do administer or receive the holy things of God by the offices of
Pastors and Teachers, entered into and executed according to the testament of
Christ, they are for this cause evil entreated, reviled, and persecuted unto
death, even by these who profess themselves to be Christians. 2. Secondly, in
that their Prelacy Priesthood and Deaconry, is the very means of thrusting
away and keeping out of the Church, the Ministry and order which Christ has
appointed in his word.

Which some of themselves have heretofore acknowledged and written, affirming
that Lord Bishops, Archdeacons, Commissaries, Officials, and the rest, Admon to
the Parliam.
thrust away most sacrilegiously the order which Christ has left in his
Church, and which the Primitive Church has used; Sermon on Romans 12.
That they rob the Church of lawful Pastors, watchful Elders, and careful
Deacons; And, that by the length of their unlawful swords they keep out the
lawful members of the body of Christ, which is the Church. Neither need we
seek any further proof hereof, then that which is daily felt and seen, in their
bloody opposition and proud exaltation above the holy things, ordinances, and
servants of Jesus Christ: Who being Lord over all, will bring their ways upon
their own heads, and when they have filled up the measure of their iniquity,
will judge them according to their works.

The fourth Argument.
THe Ministry which is such as in the nature and condition thereof, IIII.
of, it perteyneth not to any body and estate, either civil or
ecclesiastical, but only to the body and kingdom of Antichrist, that is the
Ministry of Antichrists apostasy: But the present Mininisterie of the
Church Assemblies of Engl. is such as in the nature and condition thereof it
perteyneth not to any body or estate, either civil or ecclesiastical, but
only to the body and kingdom of Antichrist: Therefore the present Ministry
of the Church-assmblies of Engl. is the Ministry of Antichrists apostasy.
The Proposition none can deny. And for it, see 2 These. 2. chap. with Rev.
13.11-18. and 14. and 16. and 17. and 18. and 19. and 21. chap.

The Assumption is clear to all that will open their eyes to see the truth of
it: in as much as their Prelacy, Priesthood, and Deaconry (the present
Ministry of that Church) is such in the nature and condition thereof, as the
civil estate of the Commonwealth may be perfect without them: for they are
ecclesiastical functions; the Church of Christ may be compleet without them,
and yet have all the offices appointed by Christ thereunto; and the Turks and
Pagans, neither have them nor require them. Only the body and kingdom of the
Romish Antichrist cannot be full and furnished in all the offices thereof
without them. Which all men know to be true. From which also an argument to the
same purpose may be framed in this sort.

The fifth Argument.
V.
THe Ministry which is such as the body of Antichrist the man of sin cannot
without it be compleet in all the members and Canonical functions thereof,
that is the Ministry of Antichrists apostasy: But the present Ministry of
the Church Assemblies of Engl. is such, as the body of Antichrist the man of
sin cannot without it be compleet in all the members and Canonical functions
thereof: Therefore the present Ministry of the Church Assemblies of Engl. is
the Ministry of Antichrists apostasy.
The Proposition is clear and certain.

The Assumption is proved by the Canons, Pontifical, and estate of the Romish
Antichrist the man of sin, and by the constitution of that body in the
members and functions thereof: As all must needs confess, that have any
knowledge of the condition of that Church and Officers perteyning thereunto.

The sixth Argument.
THe Ministry of Deacons Priests and Prelates, VI.
which accounts it self to be Christ's, and yet in deed is such as the Kings and
Rulers of the earth may and ought to suppress and root out of their dominions,
that is the Ministry of Antichrists apostasy. But the present Ministry of
the Church Assemblies of Engl. is the Ministry of Deacons Priests and
Prelates, which accounts it self to be Christ's, and yet in deed is such as the
King may and ought to suppress and root out of his Dominions. Therefore it is
the Ministry of Antichrists apostasy.
The Proposition is proved, 1. Because there is no other such Ministry but
Antichrists, which accounts it self to be Christ's, when in deed it is such as
the Magistrates ought to abandon and root out of their dominions. 2. Because
that which is in truth the Ministry of Christ, no Princes may refuse or set
against: But in so doing they sin highly against the Lord, and provoke his
judgments against themselves and their kingdoms. Rev. 17.12.13.14.16.17. with
Psalm. 2.10.11 12. and Esa. 60.10.11.12.

The Assumption has two points to be considered: The one, that the Ministry
of the Church of Engl. is Ministry of Deacons Priests and Prelates which
accounts it self to be Christ's: which themselves cannot nor will not deny. The
other, that in deed it is such as the King may and ought to suppress and root
out of his dominions. Which we have showed already both in Treatise of Minist.
of Engl. p. 25.105.134. Answ. to Mr. Jacob. p. 163.197.199. The Apology page
27.52.53.54.85. etc.
other Treatises, and in the first Reason here before. And the forward
preachers among them have yielded it, in their suits to the Parliament to have
it removed and taken away. And if the Prelates and their conforming Priests
affirm the contrary, they are impugners of the Kings supremacy, and
excommunicated ipso facto, by their own Canons: the words whereof be these, in
the second of their Canons of Anno 1603. Can. 2.
last Canons: Where first the Title is thus, Impugners of the Kings supremacy
censured; And then the Cano^ it self follows thus: Whosoever shall affirm
that the Kings Majesty has not the same authority in causes ecclesiastical
that the godly Kings had amongst the Jews, and Christian Emperors in the
Primitive Church, etc. let him be excommunicated ipso facto, and not restored
but only by the Archbishop after his repentance and public revocation of
those his wicked errors.

From which Canon, I reason thus: The godly Kings amongst the Jews had such
authority in causes Ecclesiastical, as they might suppress within their
dominions any Ministeries not ordained by the Lord, and therefore any false
Ministeries whatsoever, as Josiah did the Chemarims, the Priests of Baall, them
that burnt incense to the host of heaven, etc. Therefore also, seeing the
present Ministry of the Church of England As has been proved before Page 2.
etc.
is not that which Christ ordained and gave to his Church, and consequently
must needs be a false Ministry, the King of England having the same authority
in causes ecclesiastical as those Kings of Judah had, may and ought to
suppress and root out of his dominions this their Ministry and Prelacy of
Archbishops, Lordbishops, Suffraganes, Priests, Deacons, Subdeacons,
Archdeacons, etc. Like as King Henry the eight did the Abbats, Monks, Nuns,
etc.

And themselves cannot deny, but either they must prove their Prelacy and
inferior Ministry aforesaid to be ordained by Christ in his Testament, and so
to be the true Ministry given by Christ to his Church, or else if they affirm
that the King has not authority to suppress and take it away, they are by the
sentence of their own Canons impugners of the Kings supremacy, and
excommunicated ipso facto, and not to be restored but after repentance and
publik revocation of those wicked errors. And so comes upon them that which
Christ has said, Of thine own mouth will I judge thee, o evil servant. Luc.
19.22.

And whereas by the same Canon, the power of restoring such is committed only
to the Archbishop, with the condition aforesaid, it would be known, if the
Archbishop himself be in the same case, who shall now restore him; and whether
it can be done to him any more then to the rest, without his repentance and
public revocation of those his wicked errors. Which if he and the rest had
grace to revoke, these questions would soon be at an end.

But howsoever they deal, and the Kings of the earth for a while mainteyne or
suffer them, certain it is that the King of Kings (the Lord Jesus Christ) will
in his time utterly consume and abolish that lawless apostasy and mystery of
iniquity in all the power and tyrannical usurpation thereof. 2 These.
2.3.4.7.7. with Rev. 14-20 chap. From whence we will take the next and last
Argument, which now we will allege.

The seventh Argument.
IF the present Ministry of the Church Assemblies VII.
of England be such, as it shall be abolished by the Lord, through the light and
power of his Gospel, according to that which is written, 2 These. 2.3.8. with
Rev. 14.6.7.8. and 18.4.5.20. then it is the Ministry of Antichrists
apostasy: But the present Ministry of the Church Assemblies of Engl. is such
as it shall be abolished by the Lord, through the light and power of his Gospel,
according to that which is written, 2 These. 2.3.8. with Rev 14.6.7.8. and
18.4.5.20. Therefore it is the Ministry of Antichrists apostasy.
The Proposition is evident, as may appear by the Scriptures mentioned in it.

The Assumption also is manifest, and may thus be showed: 1. The Scripture
teaches, that 2 These. 8.3 8. with Esa. 11.4. Rev. 14.6.7.8.
the Lord will consume the man of sin with the breath of his mouth, in the
power of his word; and therefore also his counterfeit offices, ordinances, and
authority. Of which sort the present Ministry of the Church Assemblies of
Engl. being found to be, it will follow that these shall also with the rest of
that body be abolished by Christ with the brightness of his coming, and with the
breath of his mouth in the power of his Gospel. Otherwise the man of sin
should not be consumed away, as the Lord has said he shall be; and has
therefore called him the son of perdition or destruction, because he is
appointed to be consumed and abolished. 2 These. 2.3. And seeing that although in
all other places of the earth, all the offices, parts, powers, and ordinances
of his kingdom and religion were abolished, yet so long as the present offices
and functions of the Prelacy Priesthood and Deaconry, in the Archbishops,
Archdeacons, Lordbishops, Deanes, Prebendaries, Parsons, Vicars, and the rest
of that sort, with their callings, works, maintenance, assemblies, Courts,
Canons, and proceedings ecclesiastical do continue in England; the Ministry
power and authority of the man of sin were not consumed and abolished, as the
Scripture has foretold shall come to pass; it must needs be that these also
shall go into destruction with the rest of that body. For true and strong is he
which has said it, and will perform it. Rev. 18.1.2.8.20.21. and 19.1.2. with
2 These. 2.3.8.

2. Again, seeing the Scripture says, that 1 Ioh. 3.8.
for this purpose the Son of God has appeared, that he might loose the works
of the Devil: and the coming of the man of sin, in all his apostasy, is in
another Scripture said to be by the working of Satan, 2 These. 2.3.8.9. it
follows also hereupon, that Christ the son of God will break and abolish
the Prelacy and lying Ministry of that lawless one, together with the rest of
his apostasy wheresoever. Which already we have seen to be begun, in that the
Lord has now in this latter age of the world appeared (according to his
promise) in the light of his Gospel, and has begun thereby to dissolve that
work of Satan, to cast down Babylon that great city, to manifest and consume
that man of sin, to remove and abolish the offices, callings, works, and
livings, belonging to that body and kingdom of darkness: So as in diverse
countries at this day, the popish Antichristian offices and callings are
generally rejected and abandoned: And in England, the Pope, Cardinals, Priors,
Abbots, Monks, Friars, and Nuns, together with many of the popish heresies,
errors, and superstitions are abolished and cast out of the land. This has the
Son of God, that Psalm. 24.8.10.
king of glory, by the shining brightness and power of his Gospel, already
brought to pass in this latter age: Neither will he cease or give over this
his glorious work; until he has evidently consumed the body of that man of
sin, and discovered and dissolved the work of Satan in Antichrists kingdom
throughout the world. The Lord of hosts has determined it, and who shall
disannull it? His hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it away? Esa.
14.27. with 2 These. 2.8.9. Rev. 14.6.7.8.

3. Moreover, the present Ministry of the Church-assemblyes of England being
such in their Offices, entrance, administration, and maintenance, as the Lord
never set in his church (as Reason 1.
before has been proved) therefore also it cannot be doubted but that these
shall be abolished, as Christ has said, Every planting which my heavenly Father
has not planted, shall be rooted up. Mat. 15.13.

4. Finally, the sekers of reformation have been (if still they be not) of the
same judgment and expectation. Else why have they sued to the Parliaments, to
have these parts and remnants of the Popish Antichristian Kingdom yet retained
in the land, to be removed and abolished: yea and have expressly written,
Admon. to the Parliam. in the Preface.
that they shall down, hold they never so hard.

Now furthermore that this destruction of Antichrists kingdom and religion
shall be seen and done by Christ's appearing in the light and power of his
Gospel, we gather also from the Scriptures, which teach Rev. 14.6.7.8. 2 These.
2.8. with Esa. 11.4.
that by the preaching of the Gospel, Babylon falls.

And for the better discerning hereof, thus we show it further: First, by
Babylon Rev. 17.5.7. with 11.8. 2 These. 2.7.
mystically and spiritually is understood, the city kingdom and jurisdiction
of Antichrist, with the offices and ordinances belonging thereunto, the
apostasy and authority of the man of sin, the bloody and adulterous estate
of the whore that sits on many waters, with whom the Kings of the earth
have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made
drunken with the wine thereof. 1 Ioh. 2.18. and 4.3. 2 These.
2.3.4.7.8.9.10.11.12. Rev. 11.8. and 14.8.9. and 17. and 18. chap.

Secondly, the Lord Jesus will destroy Babylon, condemn the whore, and
consume the man of sin, with the breath of his mouth, with the bright
manifestation of his coming, and with the publishing of his Gospel: wherein
he will clearly and powerfully appear, to the comfort of his Church, and
destruction of the wicked. Rev. 14.6.7.8. and 18.4.5.6.20. and 19.13.15. 2
These. 2.8. with Esa. 11.4.

3. As God for a time has suffered the Princes and States of the world to give
over their power right and sovereignty unto the Beast, to submit unto,
authorize, and uphold the kingdom and jurisdiction of Antichrist: so God
again in his time does and will stir up the Princes and Magistrates, to hate
that harlot, to make her naked and desolate of her honors, dignityes, and
revenewes, to convert and employ her Lordships, lands, and livings to other
uses, and finally to suppress and abandon her offices works and abominations,
which have so long deceived and defiled the world. Rev. 17.15.16.17. and 18.
and 19. chap.

4. Fourthly, this fall of Babylon, this consumption of the man of sin, and
desolation of the great whore, shall be performed by degrees: that as it rose not
wholly up in a day, but first was in a mystery, and then was revealed, and
afterward exalted: so it shall also decay and be abolished by little and
little, till at length suddenly in one day, even in an hour, this city and
kingdom of Antichrist be destroyed and abolished, so as it shall never be found
any more: as when a great millstone is cast into the sea and rises not again,
and as of old it came to pass ( Ier. 51.61.62.63.64. with Rev. 18.20.21.
according to the word of the Prophet) in Babylon of Chaldea which was a type
and figure of this spiritual Babylon now spoken of. 2 These. 2.3.4.7.8. Rev.
14.8.9. and 18.2.7.8.20.21.22.23. with Esa. 13. and 14. chap. Ier. 50. and 51.
chap.

Lastly, at the overthrow and destruction of this Antichristian kingdom and
mystical Babylon, her Kings, Merchants, Mariners, and craftesmen shall mourn
and lament, because of the judgment come upon her, with whom they have lived
in pleasure before, and no man now buyeth their ware any more: but the servants
of God shall be glad and rejoice, and give glory to the Lord, saying,
Hallelu-iah, salvation and glory, and honor, and power be to the Lord our God:
for true and righteous are his judgments: for he has condemned the great
whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the
blood of his servants of from her hand. Reve. 18.9.10.11. etc. with 19.1.2. etc.

And hitherto of the first and second Reason. Both which I have prosecuted more
largely, as containing in them the special grounds of this controversy:
namely, that their present Ministry is not according to the ordinance of
Christ; and not this only, but is also of the apostasy of Antichrist. To
which two heads, the other Reasons here ensuing may be referred. Yet the
propounding and handling of them apart from the other, serves more plainly to
meet with some objections, and more fully to insist upon other particulars,
needful in this cause to be considered. And so we will now proceed to the
Reasons following.

The third Reason.
Whatsoever Ministry is such, as none can hear it or have any spiritual
communion with it, but in so doing he shall worship the Beasts image (spoken of
in the Revelation) and receive his mark in his forehead or hand: that
Ministry may none hear or have any spiritual communion withal. But the
present Ministry of the Church Assemblies of Engl. is such as none can hear
or have any spiritual communion therewith, but in so doing he shall worship
the Beasts image, and receive his mark in his forehead or hand: Therefore none
may hear or have any spiritual communion with the present Ministry of the
Church Assemblies of Engl.
The first part of the Reason is evident, because whosoever does so worship or
receive as there is said, brings himself under the fierce wrath of God, as it
is written, If any worship the Beast and his image, and receive his mark in his
forehead or hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, yea of
the pure wine which is poured into the cup of his wrath, and he shall be
tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy Angels and before the Lamb,
and the smoke of their torment shall ascend evermore, and they shall have no
rest day nor night, which worship the beast and his image, and whosoever
receives the print of his Name. Rev. 14.9.10.11.

That the truth of the second part of the Reason may better appear, we are
first to consider what is meant by the Beast and his image here spoken of; what
by the worshipping of it; and what by receiving his mark in the forehead or
hand: and then to apply it to the present purpose. And first, that these and
the like speeches are not to be taken literally, but in a mystical and
spiritual signification, the Spirit of God teaches us in plain words in
diverse places of this book, Rev. 14.8.9. with chap. 17.5.15.18. and 11.8. and
1.20. besides that it may be showed by necessary collection also, as will
appear in that which follows.

By Beasts, the Scripture often figureth out men and kingdoms, of beastly
qualities and conditions, so resembling them for their foolish ignorance,
savage cruelty, gredynes of prey, beastlynes of life, certainty of destruction,
etc. Dan. 7.17. and 8.20.21.22.23. with Ier. 10.14. Luke 13.31.32. 2 Timothy 4.17.
Tit. 1.12. And so here, by the beast and his image, we may understand the
Roman dominion, and Antichristian hierarchy resembling it, the body of the
man of sin, with all the offices, functions, laws, constitutions, power and
authority apperteyning thereunto. For which, compare this Scripture of Rev. 14.
with 2 These. 2.3.4.8.9. 1 Timothy 4.1.2.3. 1 Ioh. 2.18.22. and 4.3. and 2 Ioh.
ver. 6.7. Rev. 11.8. and 13.1.2.5.6.11.15.16.17. and 17.1.2.3.4.5.6.7. etc. and
18.2. etc. and 19.2.20.21. etc. and 20.4. And thus have the Martyrs of former
ages also understood it, as may be seen in Act. and Monum. edit. 5. p. 161 5.
etc.

By worshipping the Beasts image, may be understood the yielding of spiritual
subjection homage and obedience to that Antichristian kingdom, in the laws,
rules, offices, orders, power and jurisdiction thereof. And so this word
worship, is much used in the Scripture. Exodus 20.5. Deuteronomy. 12.30. and 13.2.4.
Josh. 22.5.27. Judge. 2.11. 2 King. 17.33-41. Ezech. 8.16. and 20.32. Mat. 15.9.
Act. 7.43. Col. 2.18-23.

By receiving of the mark in the forehead or hand, may be understood the
receiving of their ordinances and co^stitutions, to profess or observe them,
so as thereby we may be known unto others (as by a mark in the forehead) or
put in mind our selves (as by a mark in the hand) that we apperteyne to that
Romish or Antichristian kingdom. And that the mark here spoken of may thus be
understood, and not simply be taken for some visible characters set upon the
forehead or hand, but even for such accepting and keeping of the Beasts
ordinances as is aforesaid, appears plainly by like speech and use of these
phrases in other Scriptures. As namely,

For the one, that is the speech of a mark in the forehead, see Ezech 9.4. Rev.
7.3. where the faithful servants of God, are said to be marked and sealed in
the foreheads; not that they received a visible character or mark, but being
such as mourned for the abominations of others, and did themselves constantly
and as it were with bold faces confess Gods name and truth before the world
(as the Apostle said, Romans 1.16.
I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ) they were as evidently and certainly
known by this, and in the destruction of the wicked preserved by God, as if
they had visibly ben marked in their foreheads.

In a like manner also, when one is not ashamed of the Beasts ways, of
Antichrists ordinances and constitutions, but receives and professes them,
having (as the Prophet says) Ier. 3.3.
an whores forehead that will not be ashamed, he may be said to receive the
Beasts mark in his forehead, and be as plainly discerned of others, to be one
of that body and belonging to that kingdom, as if in his forehead there were a
visible mark imprinted.

The manner of speech seems to be borrowed from the common practice of men, who
for such things as they would have known and discerned, do use to mark them in
some such place as may well be seen and soon espied. So in the Passover the
lentill and door cheeks (as being ready to the sight) were sprinkled with
blood, that the Angel might see the blood, and so pass over the houses that
were sprinkled therewith, Exodus 12.22.23. Now in man, the forehead, or any
thing therein is in most sight and soonest espied: As when the leprosy sprang
in the forehead of Vzziah, as soon as the Priests looked upon him, forthwith
they perceived it, 2 Chronicles. 26.19.20. And in this respect it seems the Lord
commanded in the Law, that the plate whereon was graven as signets are graven,
Holiness to the Lord, should be always on Aarons forehead, thereby to figure
out the continual mediation of Christ our high Priest, who appears in the
sight of God for us. Exodus 28.36.37.38. with Heb. 7.25. and 9.24.

For the other, that is, the speech of a mark upon the hand, see Exodus 13.8-16.
Deuteronomy. 6.7-12. and 11.18. where Moses speaking of the observation of the
ordinances of the Passover, says unto Israel, It shall be a sign unto thee
upon thine hand, and for a remembrance between thine eyes, that the Law of the
Lord may be in thy mouth: for by a strong hand the Lord brought thee out of
Egypt. Exodus 13.8.9. And again he uses the same manner of speech, towching
the observation of the ordinance of consecrating their first borne to the Lord,
Exodus 13.16. And again, when he teaches the Israelites continually to
remember the words which God commanded, Deuteronomy. 11.18. By which Scriptures
appears, first that by a sign on the hand is not meant a visible sign or
mark set or engraven upon the hand, but (as Moses expounds himself) the
keeping of the ordinances and commandments of God, as the Passover, the
consecrating of the first borne, etc. Exodus 13.10.15. Deuteronomy. 6.7.8.9.12.
Secondly, that the keeping of those ordinances as God appointed them, should be
as a sign upon their hand to put them in remembrance continually of their
deliverance out of Egypt by the mighty power of God, and of their homage and
subjection due unto him for ever.

Accordingly therefore by the Beasts mark, may be understood the keeping of his
ordinances and constitutions. So as when men do keep and submit unto any the
ordinances of Antichrist, as his Ministry, Worship, Religion, a Courts, Canons
or the like, it is as if they received a mark upon their hand, to put them
still in mind of their service and subjection yielded unto him.

Thus we see how the Scripture uses this manner of speaking, when it would note
the continual remembrance of a thing, as may be seen also by like speeches in
other places, Song. 8.6. Esa. 49.16. Hag. 2.24.

And it seems (as the other) to be taken from the usual custom of men, who
because the hand of a man is always in his sight, use therefore (when they
would remember a matter) to put a ring or thread or such like thing upon their
hand, that they may not forget but still be put in mind thereof. Such also is
that speech of God in the Prophet, saying, I have graven thee upon my hand, thy
walls are ever in my sight, Esa. 49.16. where the latter part of the sentence
expounds the former (a thing often used in the Prophets) and teaches that in
this place these words, to be graven on the hand, signify to be always in
sight and remembrance. To which end may be observed, how the mark spoken of in
the Revelation, is sometimes said to be received Rev. 13.16.
in the right hand, because that hand is commonly the more used, and so more
often in the eye and sight of a man, then the other hand is.

And thus it appears, that they which keep the ordinances and constitutions
of Antichrist, may justly be said to receive his mark in their forehead or
hand, so as thereby they give notice to others, as by a mark in the forehead, or
be put in remembrance themselves, as by a mark in the hand, that they
apperteyne to his kingdom and jurisdiction. And this is the proper use of
signs, marks, characters, and the like, by them to make difference and
distinction, to give knowledge unto others, or to be put in mind our selves, of
such things as we would have distinguished known or remembered: as may be seen
both in the continual practice of men, and throughout the Scriptures. For
which, see Genesis 4.15. and 9.12.13.14.15.16. and 17.11. Number. 15.38.39.40. and
16.38. Deuteronomy. 11.18. and 22.15.16. Josh. 2.18.21. and 4.5.6.7. Esa. 30.17. Mat.
24.32.33. Luke 2.12. Romans 4.11.

Moreover, that this is the meaning as has been showed, may be gathered also
by the contrary, which is opposed thereunto by the Spirit of God in the same
scripture, which is, the keeping of the Commandments of God and says of
Jesus. Rev. 14.9.12. and 20.4. For so in that place are opposed, on the one
side Rev. 14.9.
the worshipping of the Beast and his image and receiving of his mark, and on
the other side Rev. 14.12.
the keeping of the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. As likewise in
the second commandment there are set opposite, on the one hand, Exodus 20.4.5.
the making and devising of any thing in the worship of God, or the submitting
to any such inventions; and on the other hand, Exodus 20.6.
the keeping of that only in the worship of God which he himself has
commanded. Exodus 20.4.5.6. Where also it may be observed, that the same words,
of keeping the commandments of God, are used in both these Scriptures, and
Exodus 20.4.5.6.
in the one opposed generally to all inventions in religion whatsoever, Rev.
14.9-12.
in the other specially to the constitutions and abominations of the Romish and
Antichristian jurisdiction.

As the faithful therefore which in religion submit themselves only to the
truth and ordinances of Jesus Christ prescribed in his word, are said to keep
the commandments of God and faith of Jesus, having this as a sign upon their
hand, and being sealed therewith as with a mark on the forehead: so they which
in religion submit themselves to the ordinances and constitutions of the Romish
Antichrist, are accounted by the holy Ghost to worship the Beasts image and to
receive his mark in their forehead or hand. And hitherto of the exposition of
this Scripture.

Now to apply it to the matter in hand, it is to be noted, 2 These 2.3. etc. 1 Timothy 4.1.2.3. 1 Ioh. 2.18.19. and 4.1-6. Rev. 13. and 17. chap. etc.
first that this Antichrist the man of sin has made apostasy from the
ordinances of Jesus Christ. Secondly, that he has brought in and set up in
stead thereof his own errors and constitutions, the inventions and works of
Satan: and particularly, that opposing and exalting himself against the
kingdom of Christ, he has turned the Ministry and government of Christ his
officers (which be Pastors, Teachers, and Elders) into the Ministry and
government of Archbishops, Lordbishops, Suffraganes, Chancelours, Archdeacons,
Commissaries, Priests, Parsons, Vicars, etc. entering and executing their
offices, not according to Christ's ordinance, but after their own orders,
canons and constitutions. Thirdly, that notwithstanding many popish enormities
be already removed out of the land by the mercy of God, yet the present
constitution of their Church Assemblies still is such as every one of them is
subject to a provincial Archbishop, to a diocesan Lordbishop, to a Chancelour,
to an Archdeacon, to a Priest, being the Parson, Vicar, or stipendary Curate of
the Parish: As also to a Book-worship devised by man, to the Prelates popish
courts, suspensions, excommunications, absolutions, consecrations, orderings,
degradations, deprivations, and other such proceedings, according to their
Canons and courses: which in their order were erected and are retained in the
Synagogues and kingdom of Antichrist, but were never appointed by Christ for
his Church and people to observe and yield unto, as has been proved. Whereby
it appears, that the public Ministry of their assemblies now is such as
none can have spiritual communion therewith, but in so doing they observe and
submit unto the ordinances of Antichrist; and consequently worship the Beasts
image and receive his mark in their forehead or hand, according as here before
has been declared.

Yet before I conclude this point, I would advertise the Reader, that some
understand this receiving of the mark in the forehead or hand, to be meant of
submitting unto Antichrists ordinances either openly with a bold face, or
secretly under hand. As also, that such may be said to receive the mark in
their hand, which receive to execute any office or perform any work in the
kingdom of Antichrist by his power and hand, that is, by virtue of any
authority received from him or of any subjection yielded unto him. Which may
well be applied to the buying and selling by virtue of the mark received,
spoken of Rev. 13.17. But how ever it be for the propriety of the phrase, yet
herein do all these expositions agree, that thereby is understood the
submitting to Antichrist his ordinances to be employed, and therefore come all
to one end as towching the matter in hand.

And long since, John Claydon spoken of before, a Martyr of Christ (burnt in
the days of King Henry the fifth, in the year, 1415.) held that the Bishops
license for a man to preach the word of God, is the character of the Beast,
that is Antichrist. Act. and Monum. edit 5. page 588. And after him again, Mr
Ridley, another Martyr (burnt in Queen Mary's days, in the year 1555.)
writing largely of this matter to the Christians then afflicted, shows his
judgment concerning it, thus: Act. and Monum. edit. 5. page 1618.
Does not Paul command to the Romans, which perteyneth to every Christian
soul: Romans 6.
As you have in times past given your members to do service unto uncleanness and
wickedness, from one wickedness to another: so now give your members to do
service unto righteousness, that you may be sanctified. And I pray thee good
brother what do thou think is to bear the mark of the Beast in the forehead
and in the hand that Sainst John speaks of? I know we ought warily to speak
of Gods mysteries which he showed by the spirit of prophesying to his servant
John, yet to read them with reverence, and to pray for the same so much as God
knows necessary for our time to know, I think it necessary and good.
Wherefore what I suppose is to bear the Beasts mark, I will tell thee, and
commit the judgment of my interpretation, as in all other things, to the
spiritual man. I suppose he bears the Beast of Babylons mark in his
forehead, which is not ashamed of the Beasts ways, but will profess them
openly to set forth his master the beast Abaddon. And likewise he bears his
mark in the hand, that will, and does practice the works of the Beast with his
power and hand. And likewise I will not let to tell thee, what I think to be
signed in the forehead for the servant of God is, whereof John also speaks,
reckoning up many thowsands so to have been signed of every tribe: I suppose he
is signed in the forehead, for the servant of God, whom God has appointed of
his infinite goodness, and has given him grace and strength, constantly to
confess him, and his truth before the world. And to have grace and strengh to
confess Christ, and the doctrine of the Cross, and to lament and mourn for
the abominations of Antichrist, I suppose is to be signed with Tau, whereof
Ezekiel the Prophet does speak. Thus I suppose these Prophecies are spiritually
to be understood: And to look for other corporal marks to be seen in men's
foreheads or in their hands, is nothing else but to look that there should come
some brute beast out of Babylon, or some Elephant, Leopard, Lion, or Camel or
some other such monstrous beast with ten horns, that should do all the
wonderful things spoken of in John: And yet of a beast speaks John: But I
understand him so to be called, not for that he shall be any such brute Beast,
but for that he is and shall be called the child of perdition, which for his
cruelty and beastly manners, is called the beast. The carnal Jews knew there
was a promise made that Elias should come before Christ the Messiah (the
anointed of God) to prepare his ways; they knew also there was a promise of
Messiah, that he should come and be a King, and reign in the house of David
for evermore: But they understood all so grossly and carnally, that they
neither knew Elias nor Messiah when they came: for they looked for Elias to
come down from heaven in his own person, and for Messiah to come and reign in
worldly pomp, power, riches, glory: whenas the prophecies of both were
spiritually to have been understood: Of Elias that he should come, not in
person, but in spirit, that is one that should he endued with the spirit and
gifts of grace of Elias, which was in deed John Baptist, as Christ himself did
declare to his Apostles: And of Messiah reign, all the Prophets were to be
understood of the reign of his spiritual kingdom over the house of Jacob and
the true Israelites for evermore. And so by their gross and carnal
understanding, they mistook both Elias and the true Messiah, and when they
came, knew neither of them both. So likewise I fear me (nay it is certain)
the world that wants the light of the spirit of God (for the world is not
able to receive him, says John) neither does nor shall know the beast, nor his
marks, though he rage cruelly and live never so beastly, and though his marked
men be in number like the sand of the sea. The Lord therefore vouchsafe to open
the eyes of the blind with the light of grace, that they may see and perceive
and understand the words of God, after the mind of his Spirit, Amen. Thus far
Mr Ridley.

And Mr Bale (an exile of Christ) understanding by the Beast the great
Antichrist, and by his image those governors which take upon them his
blasphemous titles, names, authority, or defense: applied it also, thus, Image
of both Churches upon Rev. 14.9.
To receive the Beasts mark in their foreheads and hands, is both to agree to
such decrees, traditions, laws, constitutions, acts, and proclamations, as
they under those titles have made, only for their own covetousnes and pomp,
and neither for the glory of God, nor yet for the right maintenance of the
Christian common wealth: And also to be sworn to the same, to subscribe to it,
to give counsel or aid to it, to mainteyne it by learning, to minister in it,
to execute under it, to accuse, punish, and put to death for it, or to think it
lawful and godly with such like.

Thus have I somewhat largely noted down the sayings of these Martyrs of former
times, as being of good weight to the matter in hand. For although Antichrist
was not then so fuly discovered nor so deeply wounded, as since he has been and
will be yet daily more in this latter age of the world (in which respect we are
not now to be pressed with every thing which they then coming newly out of the
darkness of Popery did receive and allow): Yet by these testimonies alleged and
other the like in their stories, it may appear how uprightly they judged, and
how faithfully they walked even unto death, according to the measure of light
reveiled unto them: in which respect they will rise up in judgment to condemn
this age, wherein notwithstanding that Antichrist be plainlyer manifested and
more consumed, as yet still he will be more and more til he be abolished, 2 These.
2.8. Rev. 14.6.7.8.
by the brightness of Christ's appearing in the light and power of his Gospel:
yet as if no such thing were or should be, or as if men Esa. 6.9.10. Mat.
13.14.15. Act. 28.26.27.
had eyes and saw not, ears and heard not, hearts and understood not, who is
there that do not still take pleasure in that unrighteousness of Antichrist,
disobeying the truth of the Gospel of Christ, and worshipping the image of the
Beast, and receiving his mark in their forehead or hand? For which howsoever
men do plead, yet let all remember and consider, how the Spirit of God has
foretold the end and fruict thereof to be this, to stand under the wrath and
judgment of God, to be tormented before the holy Angels and before the Lamb
for evermore.

Rev. 14.9.10.11. with 2 These. 1.8.9. and 2 These. 2.3-12.

The fourth Reason.
None may hear or join in any spiritual communion with that Ministry which
deriveth not their power and functions of Ministry from Christ, which is the
head, for the edification of the Church, which is his body. But the present
Ministry of the Church Assemblies of Engl. deriveth not their power and
functions of Ministry from Christ, which is the head, for the edification of
the Church, which is his body. Therefore none may hear or join in any
spiritual communion with the present Ministry of the Church Assemblies of
Engl.
The Proposition or first part of the Reason can not be denied: 1. Because none
may be subject to any power or head in religion, save only to Jesus Christ,
who is the alone head of the Church, in whom all fulness of power dwells, and
from whom alone the Church receives her life and strength. Ephe. 1.22.23. and
4.8.11.12.15.16. Col. 1.18.19. and 2.18.19. 1 Cor. 12.4.5.6.12.27.

2. Because the Ministers which derive not their power from this head to the
execution of an office in his body, are usurpers of that which perteyneth not
unto them, and enemies of Christ's sovereign authority: and the people which
hear them, or otherwise submit to their power and Ministry, become guilty
with them of treason against the King of Kings the Lord Jesus Christ. Mat.
28.18.19.20. 1 Cor, 12.5. Luke 19.12.13.14.27. with Exodus 20.4.5. 2 These.
2.3.4.9.10.11.12. Rev. 13. and 14. and 17. and 18. and 19. chap.

3. Because God disposes the members every one of them in the body at his
pleasure, and has fully furnished his Church with all offices needful: so as
it is not in the power of any creature to give or take away any members to or
from Christ's body, or to approve by any practice such giving or taking away
under any color whatsoever. Romans 12.3-8. 1 Cor. 12.6.12.18.27.28. Ephe.
4.4-16. 1 Timothy 3. and 5. and 6.13.14. Rev. 22.18.19.

The Assumption or latter part of the Reason is proved not only by this, That
the Ministers of the Church Assemblies of England have not those offices and
callings which Christ has given to his Church for the work of his Ministry:
as has been showed before in the first Reason, to which this may be referred:
but may also be made manifest further, and showed by the contrary, after this
manner:

1. First, the present Ministry of the Church Assemblies of England, is of
Deacons and Priests made by the Prelates, some of them being Curates, some
Vicars, some Parsons, some Archdeacons, some Lordbishops, some Archbishops, etc.

2. Now these be such offices as were left in England by the Pope, and are
still retained in the kingdom of Antichrist: neither were known in the
Churches of Christ planted by the Apostles, but rose up with the body of
Antichrist, and perteyne thereunto: as has been handled before.

3. And, the Scripture teaches plainly, that Satan out of the bottomeles pit
is the author and head of those offices and functions which were formed and
erected in the kingdom of Antichrist the man of sin: and consequently of the
offices aforesaid yet remaining in the Church of England. 2 These. 2.9. Rev.
9.2.3.11.20. and 13.11. and 18.2. and 20.10.

4. And if Satan be the erecter and head of these offices and functions, then
it is certain that Jesus Christ is not. For what concord has Christ with
Satan? 2 Cor. 6.15. 1 Ioh. 3.8.

Whereupon ensues, that whosoever administer by virtue of the offices
aforesaid (as the Ministers of the Church Assemblies of Engl. do) they derive
not their power and authority from Jesus Christ the head of the Church, which
is his body, even the fulness of him that fills all in all things: but from
the dragon that old serpent, Satan the head of the body and kingdom of
Antichrist, the Prince of darkness, even the spirit that works in the children
of disobedience.

And this have the seekers of reformation a long time since understood, and
published to the world: who speaking of the ecclesiastical government of the
Church of England, say it is Admon. to the Parliam. sect. 14-20. T C first
reply page 88. and 204. Mr. Fenners Answer to the Confut. of Nichols recant.
page 61. etc.
Antichristian and divelish and contrary to the Scriptures. That whatsoever
comes from the Pope (who is Antichrist) comes first from the Devil, and
out of the bottomless pit: That the Names and Offices of Archbishops,
Lordbishops, Archdeacons, Commissaries, Deanes, Prebendaries, Parsons, Vicars,
Stipendaries, and Parish priests etc. came from the Pope and are an
Antichristian hierarchy: That Satan is the author of the false Ministry in
the apostasy of the Man of sin, and in the kingdom of Antichrist the beast:
That their offices and callings be such as were first devised and still are
retained in the kingdom of Antichrist, whereof they cannot deny but Satan is
the head.

Now therefore let all men judge, whether any can with a good conscience hear
the word, receive the Sacraments, or have any spiritual communion with their
Ministry in this estate: yea though the men that be in it be of never so great
gifts, and teach never so much truth. Is it divelish, and may the people of God
join unto it? Came it out of the bottomless pit, and shall we serve the God of
heaven by it? Do they which preach by virtue thereof, derive their power from
another head then Jesus Christ, even from Satan the head of the false Church:
and shall the members of Christ and his Church, by hearing or otherwise, submit
their souls and consciences to be wrought upon by it? God forbid. Know we not,
that as the true Ministry was ordained by our Savior Christ, for the
edification of the Church and salvation of the hearers: so the false Ministry
has been erected by Satan, and is retained by Antichrist, for the subversion
of the Church, the deceiving and destruction of the hearers?

We deny not, but many of these Ministers be men of good gifts and preach much
truth and comfortable doctrine: but this we say (and it is found too true) that
the more gifts and truths they bring with them, the more they uphold this
mystery of iniquity and Ministry of Satan; the more deeply they inthrall the
hearers under the bondage of Antichrist; and the longer they deteyne them from
the way and ordinances of Jesus Christ. For who sees not, that the dumb
Ministers, though they have the same kind of Ministry among them as the rest,
even the same Deaconry and Priesthood received of the Prelates (there being no
other allowed in that Church) yet being of no gifts to call and intise them
that pass by the way to come unto them, are therefore much despised and
rejected of the best and most forward of the people? And would not the
preachers also, who by their gifts allure the passers by to come and hear
them, be as much despised and rejected, Prove. ^.13.14.15.16.17.
if they should teach falsehood only, and no truth; impiety, and no godlynes?
But how could they then so colourably entise and entertayne their guests as now
they do? how could then their stolen waters and hid bread be so sweet and
pleasant as now it is? how could they so greatly uphold this work of Satan,
and so long deteyne their hearers in subjection to Antichrists Ministry, and
in defection from the way of Christ, as now they have done? So as all may see
that by reason of the gifts they have and of the truth they teach, the
abomination of their Ministry and Church Government is so colored as few
consider it is 2 These. 2.7.
a mystery of iniquity; few conceive it is Ibid. ver. 9.
the work of Satan, few know that Prove. 9.18.
the dead are in their assemblies, and that their guests are in the depth of
hell.

And Satan himself that subtle serpent and deceiver, perceiving how by
falsehood only he cannot continue those offices and ordinances, which for
deceiving of the world he has framed and set up in the kingdom of Antichrist,
is content for the upholding of his work to receive many truths, to have the
word preached, and sacraments administered, so as it be by his own offices and
according to his own ordinances (because by this means his ways and
constitutions are retained) rather then by abandoning the truth utterly, to
have all his Ministry and works of iniquity discovered and quite abolished.
Neither can we think otherwise, but he will rather choose to maynteyne the
strength of his kingdom, in reteyning his officers and ordinances, though it
be with loss of some false doctrine and admission of some truths for a time,
then otherwise by an utter refusal hereof to suffer loss of all his
merchandise at once, not only of his false doctrines, but of his false offices
also and constitutions, by which he rules and administreth his Antichristian
kingdom, and hops by them in time upon fit opportunity again to bring in
his former heresies, and to remove those doctrines of truth, which for a season
he has in a sort ben forced to admit. He that can 2 Cor. 11.14
transform himself into an Angel of light, can be content to yield something
for a time unto the truth, that afterward he may have the more advantage
against it and them that profess it. Therefore also it is no great thing,
though Ibidem. ver. 15.
his Ministers transform themselves, as though they were the Ministers of
righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.

In the mean time, let none marveile if they see the estate of things in the
world to be such, as plainly bewray that Satan and Antichrist, so as they may
have their Ministry retained, choose rather (when they cannot otherwise do
withal) to have some truths of the Gospel taught by their Officers therein,
then to have both their Ministry refused, and every truth of the Gospel
freely taught by the Officers of Christ: thinking it to be better for them to
continue their constitutions with admission of some truths, then that both
Christ's ordinances should be received, and the whole truth yielded unto, in
obedience of faith.

But let all yet in the fear of God take heed unto themselves how under color
of learning the truth, hearing the word, enjoying the Sacraments, and the like
persuasions, they be drawn to have any spiritual communion with that
Ministry aforesaid, seeing they derive not their Ministerial functions and
authority from Christ the head of the Church, but from Satan the Prince of the
world; so as none can hear the word, receive the Sacraments, or learn the
truth from their Ministry in this estate, but they shall therein submit
themselves to that Ministry which Satan has set up in the kingdom of
Antichrist, and continues under these and the like pretenses among his
subjects. Fearful and to be remembered always is the verdict of the Apostle, 2
These. 2.10.11.12.
that God will send them the efficacy of delusion that they shall believe lies
and be damned, because they believe not nor receive the love of the truth that
they might be saved. And hitherto of this further declaration of the Assumption.

Another co^firmatio^ thereof is, that the Church-asse^blies of Engl. whereunto
their Ministry belongs, are not true visible Churches of Christ, as now they
stand. Therefore also it cannot be that the Ministers thereof can in such
estate derive their Ministry from Christ, for the edificatio^ of those
Churches, as being his body whereof he is the head.

That their Church Assemblies are not in their estate true visible Churches of
Christ, has often ben proved heretofore: and may be seen, in that they are
vnseparated from the world; not joined together in communion of the Gospel by
voluntrrie profession of the faith of Christ and submission to the government
which he has prescribed to his Church; not having the power of Christ's
Churches, for the receiving of any truth, or redressing of any evil among them;
but standing in bondage under Antichrist, in their Prelacy, Preisthood,
Worship, ecclesiastical Courts, Canons, Officers, proceedings, etc. The further
handling whereof, may be had The Apology to Oxf. Doctors page 44. etc. Refut
of M Giff. Answ. to Mr. Stone, Mr Jacob, Mr Hild. p. 62. etc. Counterpoys. to
Consid. and Argum. p. 127. etc.
in sundry other Treatises; to which I refer the Reader: entreating all
carefully to observe this here, that the Ministers of the Church of Engl. not
deriving their functions of Ministry from Christ the head, for the edification
of the Church which is his body, it must needs be unlawful for any, and
specially for the members of the body of Christ, to hear or otherwise to
comunicate with the^ in their worship, under any pretense whatsoever.

The fifth Reason.
NOne may hear or have any spiritual communion with those Ministers, which
minister the holy things of God and work upon the consciences of men by virtue
of a false spiritual calling. But the Ministers of the Church Assemblies of
England, minister the holy things of God and work upon the consciences of men
by virtue of a false spiritual calling. Therefore none may hear or have any
spiritual communion with the Ministers of the Church Assemblies of England.
The Major or first part of the Reason is proved:

1. Because the ministration of the holy things of God, is a special part of
Gods spiritual worship: and therefore neither to be done by any false spiritual
calling, nor to be received from any so ministering. Mat. 28.18.19.20. Act.
20.17.28. Ephesians. 4. 11.12. 1 Cor. 3.8.9. and 4.1. and 5.3.4.5. and 11.23. 24.
25. and 12.4.5.6.13.18.28. 2 Cor. 5.19.20. Col. 4.17. 1 Timothy 3.15. and 6.13. --
16. 2 Timothy 4.3.4.5. Heb. 5.4. with Nu^. 16.40. Ier. 23.16.21.22. Ezech. 43.8.
and 44.6.7. 8. 9. Rev. 2.1.2.7. etc.

2. Because the consciences of the people of God are the Temples of the living
God wherein he dwells by his Spirit, and ought therefore only to be subject to
the Lord, and taught by him in his own ordinance. 1 Cor. 3.16. and 2 Cor.
6.16.17.18. with 5.20. Ioh. 13.20. Heb. 13.7.17. Rev. 22.16.17.18.19.

3. Because the Lord Jesus Christ alone must have this preeminence, and the
Church may not suffer any whomsoever to bear rule over them at their own
pleasure. Col. 1.18.19. and 2.18.19.

4. Because in submitting the soul to a false spiritual Ministry, men defile
the Temple of God, and withdraw their subjection from Christ, and become the
subjects of Antichrists: as it is written, The Temple of God is holy, which ye
are: And, No man can serve two masters: for either he shall hate the one and
love the other, or else he shall lean to the one and despise the other. And, of
whomsoever a man is overcome, even to the same is he in bondage. 1 Cor. 3.16.
17.18. and 2 Cor. 6.16.17. with Mat. 6.24. Luke 6.46. Mal. 1.6. Romans 6. 16. 2 Thessalonians. 2.3.4, 2 Pet. 2.19.

The Minor or second part of the reason is proved, because they minister the
holy things of God and work upon the consciences of men by virtue of their
Ministry received of the Prelates, from their spiritual authority, which is
usurped and Antichristian; and therefore by virtue of a false spiritual
calling: as has been showed before in the second Reason, and is proved in Mr
Bradsh. Argum. 10. Mr Jacobs Reasons for necess. of reform. p. 4.44.52. etc.
diverse of their own writings. Yet here is somewhat to be annexed for the
clearing of some exceptions, specially concerning such as are of greatest
forwardnes among them.

Some there be which say, they preach not by virtue of their Ministry taken
from the Prelates, but by virtue of some other calling and authority. Let such
consider and answer, 1. Why they would seem to renounce that calling received
of the Prelates? 2. Secondly, if they disclayme that Ministry appointed by Law
of the land, why they blame us for doing the like? 3. Thirdly, if they preach
by virtue of another calling then that they have received of the Prelates, how
then they stand Ministers of that Church where no other is allowed? and how
they impose themselves upon any of their parishes or assemblies, seeing the
laws of the land allow only the Prelacy Priesthood and Deaconry aforesaid? 4.
Fourthly, how they can avoid, but needs they must be therein both intruders and
hypocrites? Intruders, because they take upon them and exercise a public
office in that Church, against the public laws and constitutions thereof:
Hypocrites, because they pretend in show one thing to the Prince, people, and
State; and yet perform another thing in deed: They pretend and seem to stand
by the Princes laws, and by the authority of their calling had from the
Prelates (for otherwise they could not stand Ministers in any of those
asse^blies): and yet they practice the contrary, if they stand not by this, but
by virtue of some other calling and authority, as sometimes they affirm.

But let us suppose that which is not, namely, that they had some other calling
which were lawful: yet also receiving or reteyning this unlawful calling of
the Prelates, this were but to halt between two opinions, and to set their
thresholds by Gods thresholds, and their posts by Gods posts, even their
inventions by Gods ordinances. Of which kind of worship the Scripture
witnesses, that it is nothing else but to set a wall between God and them, and
to defile his holy name with their abominations. Ezech. 43.8. with 1 King.
18.21.

Finally, whatsoever they pretend of another calling, Mr Hild. to Mrs N. Mr
Jacobs comparison of marriage. His Reasons for necess. of reform. p. 50. Offer
of Conf. page 39.
by their Churches or peoples choosing, accepting, willing subiecting to their
Ministry, etc. yet it is evident that in very deed they preach the word and
minister the Sacraments, and execute all duties of their Ministry, by virtue
of their calling taken from the Prelates: As may appear by these reasons
following:

1. Because they cannot stand public Ministers of the Church Assemblies of
Engl., unless they receive of the Prelates the Deaconry and Preisthood
aforesaid. And at their ordination, they have this authority given them of the
Prelates, when the Bishop delivers to every one of them, the Bible in his
hand, saying, Book of ordering priests. fol. 14.
Take thou authority to preach the word of God, and to minister the holy
sacraments in the congregation, where thou shall be so appointed.

2. Because that also by the law of their Church, they are Canons of Anno,
1603. Can. 8.
excommunicated ipso facto, if they affirm, that they who are made Bishops,
Priests, or Deacons after their form of making and consecrating them, are not
lawfully made, nor to be accounted by themselves or others, to be truly
Bishops, Priests, or Deacons, until they have some other calling to those
Offices.

3. Because the people, even the best and most religious among them (as now
they stand in the confusion and bondage of those ecclesiastical assemblies,
officers, canons, and proceedings) have not the liberty of the Churches of
Christ, nor power in that estate to choose and submit unto the true and lawful
Ministry appointed by Christ. Of which point see further, in the Treatise of
the Ministry of the Church of Engl. p. 119.120.121.

4. And lastly, because without and against the peoples consent (by whose
approbation and subjection to their Ministry they would seem to stand) they
are by the Prelates alone, silenced, deprived, and degraded, from exercising
any Ministry in those assemblies. Whereby even themselves profess to the
world, that they have their Ministry from the Prelates; that they exercise it
by virtue of their calling received from them; and that they still remain in
bondage under their Antichristian authority. Not to show further in
particulars, how their estate is such (whatsoever they think or pretend
otherwise) as both themselves, their Ministry, and people stand all of them
subject to the Prelates, and to their Antichristian Courts, suspensions,
exco^munications, absolutions, and all other their proceedings, officers,
canons, and constitutions ecclesiastical.

In the Scriptures we read, that the Apostles, being true Ministers of Christ,
would not at the commandment and threatening of the lawful Magistrates and
Rulers leave of to preach in the Name of Jesus, Act. 4.5.6.7. 8. etc. And why
should not these preachers, if they were in a true Ministry, much more refuse
to leave it at the appointment of the Prelates, who are unlawful usurpers of
the jurisdiction which they challenge and exercise in the Church? Yea if so be
their offices and authority were lawful, yet when they forbid that which God
has commanded, all the Scripture teaches in such cases not to yield obedience
unto them any more then the Apostles did to the Rulers of Israel in the matter
before said.

If it be said, that the Apostles had an immediate calling of Christ, and
therefore refused to obey the Rulers: We answer, that they had in deed an
immediate calling of the Lord, but they made not this the ground of their
refusal, neither might so have done, if the Magistrate commandment said upon
them had been lawful. Here therefore two things are to be observed: First, that
in all lawful things, the Apostles as well as any other Christians were bound
to obey the Magistrates in the Lord. And so they both did themselves, and
taught others to do, saying, Let every soul be subject to the higher powers.
Every soul, as well the Apostles and Prophets, as any other whosoever. Romans
13.1. 1 Pet. 2.13-17. Secondly, the Apostles being at that time so enjoined and
threatened by the Governors of Israel, laid this for the foundation and ground
of their answer and refusal, that they ought to obey God rather then men. Act.
4.19. and Act. 5.29. Which is a duty as necessarily required of all Ministers
and Christians, as it was of the Apostles, namely, to obey God and not Man,
when Man forbids that which God commands, or commands that which God
forbids.

An example in deed there is of Uriah the Priest, who at the commandment of
the King of Judah made an altar after the fashion of that of Damascus, and
sacrificed thereon. 2 King. 16.10.11. But therein he sinned greatly:
notwithstanding that he offered upon that altar to the Lord, such
burnt-offerings, meat offerings, and peace offerings, and at such times of the
morning and evening sacrifice, as God himself had appointed. And if in that
time of the Law he ought not to have done this though the King of Judah
commanded it, but should rather have lost his life for refusing it: much less
may the Church-Ministery now under the Gospel, at the appointment of any
Princes (Christian or other) beframed or exercised after any new manner devised
by Man, and least of all after Antichrists that Man of sin: Yea though in
that Ministry many doctrines of the Gospel be taught, and such Sacraments
administered as Christ has ordained. For the other was but contrary to an
ordinance given by Moses, whereas this is contrary to an ordinance given by
Jesus Christ, who being the son is worthy of more honor then Moses the
servant. Heb. 3.3.

And here again concerning such as plead, that they teach the truth and many
excellent points of doctrine: It is to be observed, that yet none may therefore
hear their Ministry under color of learning the truth and receiving comfort
from them; neither may for this cause continue in subjection to their Ministry
and ordinances: because that although men hear much truth from them, yet in
yielding to hear and receive it from Antichrists Ministry, they defile the
Temple of God in themselves (if they be the Lords) even their souls and
consciences, and become the subjects of Antichrist the son of perdition. Not
to speak of the many errors and falsehoods, which they also teach and
mainteyne. And for the truth which they preach, it is no new thing (as we have
showed before) that the Ministers of Antichrist should in diverse things teach
and bring the truth with them. For when Satan cannot by falsehood utter his
wares, merchandise, ordinances, Ministry, worship, etc. he will be glad to
utter the same by teaching the truth. He is beyond measure skillful in framing
delusions, and making them meet that they may be received: and therefore when
he perceives that he cannot get men to submit themselves to his ordinances by
heresies and falsehood, he yields himself to bring the truth with him, to the
intent that his ordinances may thereby be received which otherwise would be
rejected, and to the end they may be had in estimation and obyed even for the
truths sake which they bring with them. Of which thing see what is further
spoken here before, in the other Reason, Page 66. etc.

And Mr Beza against Saravia has a good saying concerning this point, which he
shows by the practice of Christ and his Apostles (spoken of in Mark. 1.24.25.
Luke 4.34.35. Act. 16.16.17.18.) vidz, that although Antichrist teach that
which is most true, as sometimes he does, to the end he may under color of the
truth more easily seduce men to beleev his lies, yet the truth is not to be
heard and received from his month, but even then ought we to stop our ears,
least under this pretense talking with him we be deceived by him: for the truth
is not to be received from the spirit of lies and untruth. And I would to God
(says he) that this were diligently observed of those wise Mediators, who
think that composition and agreement may be made with Antichrist: seeking a
mean there, where it is not at all to be found. Beza contra Sarav. cap. 25. p.
193.

Moreover, who knows not that Antichrist and his Ministers have been and
still are in show hypocritical friends, but in deed great enemies of Jesus
Christ, even under the name of Christ fighting against Christ? Which thing how
could they do, if they did not profess and teach many truths of the Gospel
of Christ? For if they should deny every truth thereof, and say plainly that
they were not the Church and Ministers of Christ, then were they presently
espied to be such as they are; and who would follow them any longer? But
Babylon is Rev 17.5. 2 These. 2.7.
a mystery: and therefore not easily perceived or avoided, till God reveal it
and draw us out of it. And whosoever will aright discern the condition of
Antichrists apostasy, must with John be carried as into the wilderness in the
spirit, that we may look upon it, not according to the show and account it has
in the world, but as it is in deed esteemed of the Lord and discovered in his
word. Rev. 17.3.4.5.6. And when it is showed unto us, yet are we in our selves
like Lot lingering and finding delays, till God being merciful unto us, take
and draw us as it were out of Sodom: whereas we should be like minded as David
who said, I have considered my ways, and turned my feet into thy testimonies:
I made have and delayed not, to keep thy commandments. Psalm. 119.59.60. with
Genesis 19.1-16. Rev. 11.8. and 18.4.5.

The sixth Reason.
IF the present Ministry of the Church Assemblies of Engl. be a strange
Ministry, then is it not lawful in the worship of God to hear it or have any
spiritual communion therewith. But the present Ministry of the
Church Assemblies of Engl. is a strange Ministry. Therefore it is not lawful
in the worship of God to hear it or have any spiritual communion therewith.
The consequence of the Proposition is necessary, and cannot be denied: 1.
Because Christ sets it down as a property of his sheep to be observed, that
they follow not strangers, but flee from them, for that they know not their
voice. Ioh. 10.5. Rev. 2.2.

2. Because he that ministers in the Church being a stranger, presumptuously
approaches to minister before the Lord, and polluteth the Sanctuary and holy
things of God. Number. 16. chap. and 18.4.5. Ezech. 44.7. with Rev. 17.1.2. and
19.2.20.

3. Because by having spiritual communion with such, we embrace the bosom of
a stranger, and so commit spiritual whoredom against the Lord. Prove. 5.20.
with Number. 15.9. Psalm. 106.39.

The truth of the Assumption is manifest, if we consider what a strange
Ministry is, namely, that which is not by the Lord ordained and given for that
work: As some of themselves have published heretofore, that the holy Scripture
accounts such for strangers in the Ministry, which have not their offices
limited by the prescript of Gods word: And, it is all new which is strange,
and strange which is not commanded by the word of God. T.C. his 2. reply.
page 438.439.

And here before, we have proved Reason. 1.
that their Ministry is not appointed by Christ in his word. Which themselves
also have confessed and published, writing in an Admonition to the Parliament,
Admon to the Parliam. treatise 2. section, 20.21.
that they have an Antichristian hierarchy and popish ordering of Ministers
strange from the word of God and the use of all well reformed Churches in the
world. Where also they call all the Ministers made by the Prelates (and others
their Church has none) by the name of New creatures. And in Sermon on Romans 12.
another treatise, speaking of diverse of their chiefest offices, they write,
that the Apostles never knew them, Sion has not heard of them, Jerusalem which
is above will not acknowledge them, that the watchmen being a sleep, they crept
into the city of the Lord, and have no title nor interest in the Church as
public members, but are rather members and parts of the strumpet and whore of
Rome then of the pure virgin and spouse of the immaculate Lamb. Thus was their
judgment heretofore: If now they be otherwise minded, either they must show
out of the word of God, the offices, entrance, administration, and maintenance
of their Church-Ministery, or else (seeing this cannot be done) the sheep of
Christ must and will account them as strangers, and therefore flee from them
and the tents of their assemblies, least otherwise they perish in their sins.
Ioh. 10.5. with Numb. 16.26. and 18.7. and Rev. 18.4.

And to the end this thing may the better be observed, let us here a little
consider the history and conspiracy of Corah Dathan and Abiram, recorded in the
book of Numbers, chapter 16. When God by the hand of Moses had appointed Aaron and
his sons to the office of the Priesthood, Corah a Levite, and Dathan and
Abiram of the tribe of Reuben, with other famous men of the Congregation,
conspire and strive against Moses and Aaron, touching the Priesthood:
challenging them that they took too much upon them, because (as they thought)
the Priesthood belonged not to Aaron and his sons only, as Moses had
appointed it, but seeing all the Congregation was holy, and that the Lord was
among them, therefore others of them also might have and execute it. Where
further it is to be noted, that Corah, Dathan, Abiram, and the rest, differed
not from Moses, neither strove with him in any point of Religion, but towching
the Priesthood and Ministry only. They held that the true God only was to be
worshipped; and not after any idolatrous manner, but according to his own will,
with the sacrifices and the incense which he had appointed; and in all other
points of Religion accounted fundamental they agreed with Moses. Only in this
they differed and opposed, concerning those offices and Officers, by which the
incense was to be offered, and other duties of Gods worship to be performed,
that is, as towching the Priests office: Moses holding that the Priesthood
perteyned to Aaron and his sons, Corah and his company thinking otherwise.
The matter is brought by Moses before the Lord to be decided. He ended the
controversy, first by bringing destruction upon Corah, Dathan, Abiram, and
such as abode in their tents; secondly by the budding of Aarons rod and the not
budding of the other rods of the Princes of Israel: and hereupon also gives
strait charge, that no stranger come near to do the Priests office, or if any
do come near, that he dye for it Number. 16. and 17. and 18.1-7.

Now to apply this to the question in hand, we may thus consider of it: That
now the controversy and conspiracy being not against Moses the serva^t, but
against Christ the son; not about the persons who are to be in the true
offices, but about holding and keeping in of false offices; not by Corah Dathan
Abira^ and others sometimes visible members and famous men in the true Church,
but by the officers of Antichrist the great enemy of Jesus Christ, yea by
Antichrist himself in his officers in the false Church: That therefore if the
people then were bound to hearken unto Moses Number. 16.25.26.
persuading the^ to depart from the tents of those wicked men, and to touch
nothing of theirs, least they perished in their sins, then it behooveth the
people of God now to obey Jesus Christ Rev. 18.4.
requiring us to depart out of Babylon, and not to partake in her sins, least
we receive also of her plagues: and therefore not to abide or have any
spiritual communion within the tents, that is, under the jurisdiction and in
the conspiracy of Antichrist: yea not so much as to hear the word or receive
the Sacraments, ministered in a true Church of Christ, by any officer of the
kingdom of Antichrist: such as the present Ministry in question has been
proved to be.

For if at that time none of the children of Israel might execute the Priests
office, being strangers as touching it: then now may no Canaanite, no stranger,
specially by office, administer before Jesus Christ, nor be received into his
Church: But all the vessels brought before the Lord, must be holy unto him: and
therefore must be cleansed first, and purged from the filthynes of Antichrist,
before they may be used in the house of the Lord of hosts. Numb. 16.40. with
Joel. 3.17. Zach. 14.21. Esa. 35.8. and 52.11. and 66.20. with Heb. 3.1.2.3.
and 5.4.

If any think, that yet notwithstanding they may present their bodies at these
assemblies, so as they do not hearken nor consent with the heart to that which
is done among them, they both deceive themselves and dissemble with others, and
(above all) sin against God, who in the second commandment has straightly
forbidden us to submit either body or soul to any strange worship or
inventions of man in religion. Exodus 20.4.5. As accordingly the Prophets in the
defection of Israel taught the people, not to come to Gilgal, nor to go up to
Beth-aven, unless they would multiply their transgressions. Hos. 4.15. Amos 4.4.
and 5.15. And the Apostles likewise have taught all Christians what to do in
such cases, Save your selves from this froward generation. Come out from among
them, and separate your selves, and touch no unclean thing. And, Go out of
Babylon, that ye be not partakers in her sins. Act. 2.40. 2 Cor. 6.17. Rev.
18.4. Even as in the history of Corah Datha^ and Abiram and the rest has been
seen, what heavy destruction came upon such as departed not from their tents
but continued with them. Neither will it help to say, that they which were in
that company of Corah and his accomplices, consented with them in their
conspiracy; which these pretend they do not: For it is plain notwithstanding,
that when once they were warned to depart from their tents, such as departed
not, were destroyed in that destruction, all of them, even to the young
children, who having not understanding, could not give consent to that which
was done. Number. 16.26.27.32. etc.

Neither can the example of Naaman (sometimes alleged) warrant such practice.
For first it is manifest, that Naaman spoke of two things, whereunto the
Prophet gives but one answer. The first, that there might be given him two
miles load of the earth of Israel, because he would thenceforth offer no burnt
offering or sacrifice unto any other God, save unto the Lord. The other, that
the Lord would be merciful unto him, when his Master went into the house of
Rimmon to worship there, and leaned on his hand, and he bowed down in the
house of Rimmon; that when he bowed down in the house of Rimmo^, the Lord
would be merciful to him in that matter. Which two things when Naaman had
propounded, Elishaes answer unto him was thus, Go in peace. 2 King.
5.17.18.19. Now whatsoever men would think of the latter of these, yet the
first is such as all will grant to be superstitious and unlawful: For there
was no holiness in the earth it self, and Jerusalem only was the place
appointed for sacrifice at that time. So as by the Prophets answer (whether it
were only according to their woonted manner of bidding one another farewell, or
to be further and otherwise minded, yet) there cannot be proved a consent and
approbation given to the things spoken of.

Next, let us suppose that Naamans bowing down in the house of Rimmon, may have
a double consideration: one, as being a religious action; the other, as being
civil. Religious, if Naaman himself worshipped there. Civil, if the King only
worshipped, and no other with him: so as Naaman now was with him but for to
lean upon there, as in other places at other times. Which being admitted, yet
then if it be considered as a religious action in him, all know it to be
unlawful 1 King. 19.18. Romans 11.4.
to bow the knee to Baal, and therefore also to bow down in the house of
Rimmon; and no more allowed by the Prophet, then his other purpose of having
the earth of the land of Israel with him to sacrifice upon. And if it be
considered only as a civil action, then neither were it to the question in
hand (which is concerning religious worship done or thought to be done by all
present) nor for any persons but such as have like special employment about
their Lords and Masters for use of their service, when they go to the place
of their worship. But now it is certain and plain that Naaman asked pardon of
God for it, and doubled this his request for mercy, as being very much affected
with it. Which for a good and lawful thing he needed not have done. And
howsoever he purposed not hereafter to offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any
God save only to the Lord God of Israel, yet he thought still of bowing down
with his Master in the house of Rimmo^; for which he craved mercy, as
acknowledging it to be evil. And thus might the Prophets answer fitly and
needfully be given unto him, not as saying, Go and do as thou have said, but,
Go in peace, trouble not thy self with these things which would not further
but hinder the peace of conscience; and being now cleansed of thy leprosy be
careful that thou sin not against the Lord, but serve him, which forgiveth
thine iniquity and heals thy infirmities: and peace from him be to thee. 2
King. 5.1.14.17.18.19. with John. 5.5-14. and 14.1.27. Psalm. 103.3. and
122.6.7.8. 1 Chronicles. 12.18.

And otherwise, the approving of Naaman to come to worship in the house of
Rimmon, should both be against the whole course of the scriptures, and against
the practice of the Martyrs in all ages, and a ready means for corrupting of
others, and defiling himself, and dishonouring the Lord whom now hereafter he
intended only to make burnt offering and sacrifice unto.

And in this case we must always remember, that as God has made and redeemed
both body and soul, and will glorify both in the life to come; so he will of
us be glorified in this life both in our bodies and souls, in all our ways,
and specially in the service and worship of his Name. Therefore would not the
seven thousand in Achabs time bow the knee unto Baall, nor kiss him with their
mouth. 1 King. 19.18. Therefore would not Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fall
down and bow themselves to the image that King Nebuchadnezar had set up: And
when he threatened them and said, If ye bow not down, ye shall be cast immediately
into the mids of an hot fiery furnace: for who is that God, that can deliver
you out of my hands? they answered and said to the King, O Nebuchadnezar, we
are not careful concerning this matter to answer thee: Whether it be that our
God whom we serve, who is able to deliver us, do from the hot fiery furnace
and from thine hand, o King, deliver us: Or whether he do not, be it known to
thee o King, that we will not serve thy Gods, nor bow down to the golden image,
which thou have set up. Dan. 3.12-18.

The like work of faith should be seen in all the people of God. For Romans 10.10.
with the heart man believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth man
confesses to salvation. And our bodies are not our own any more then our
souls, but both of them are the Lords, who has bought them with a price.
Therefore ought we to glorify God in both, and to yield the one no more then
the other to any false worship or uncleanness whatsoever. 1 Cor. 6.19.20.

Finally, it should else be lawful to present our bodies at the Mass, and at
any idolatry old or new wheresoever. And how then have there ben or can there
ever be any Martyrs of Jesus, which are on his side, called and chosen and
faithful? Rev. 17.6.14. and 19.11.14. and 20.4.

But to leave such unconscionable disse^blers to the judgment of God, let not
us forget that the Lord our God has forbidden us to endow any other, to
receive or bow down to any inventions of Man in religion, specially to the
constitutions and worship of Antichrist. And let us take heed we provoke not
the Lord to anger, who is a jelous God, not enduring that his people should
embrace the bosom of a stranger and break his covenant, but pouring forth his
wrath for this cause upon his people, and visiting this iniquity even upon the
third and fourth generation of them that hate him, and keep not his
commandments but go a whoring with their own inventions. Exodus 20.4.5.6.
Numb. 15.39. Psalm. 16.4. and 106.35-40. Prove. 5.20. Ezech. 44.7. 1 Cor. 10.22.
Rev. 14.9.10.11. and 18.4.5. and 22.18.19.

The seventh Reason.
IF the present Ministry of the Church Assemblies of Engl. be not from
heaven, but of men: then is it not lawful in the worship of God to hear it or
have any spiritual communion therewith. But the present Ministry of the
Church Assemblies of Engl. is not from heaven, but of men. Therefore it is not
lawful in the worship of God to hear it or have any spiritual communion
therewith.
The consequence of the Proposition is manifest:

1. Because the Ministry with which we may lawfully communicate is from
heaven, that is, appointed by God and warranted in his word. Mat. 21.25.26.
Ephe. 4.8.11.12. Heb. 5.4.

2. Because the worshipping of God by a Ministry framed by Man, is a breach
of the second commandment: which the Lord has threatened severely to punish.
Exodus 20.5. Deuteronomy. 12.30.31.32. Esa. 29.13. with Mat. 15.15.9.

3. Because such a ministry is unclean and loathsome in Gods sight, so as the
people of God can have no sanctified use thereof. Number. 15.39.40. 2 Chronicles. 13.9.
Esa. 30.22. and 52.11. and 66.20. Zeph. 1.4.

The truth of the Assumption is evident: because God has not appointed the
Ministry of the Church Assemblies of Engl. but Man has framed and set it up.
Which may plainly be seen by comparing the Book of God, and their Books
together: The Book of God, where their offices callings and administration
cannot be found to be from heaven, ordained by the Lord: Their own Books of
making and consecrating Bishops Priests and Deacons; of Common prayer and
administration of the sacraments; of Canons and constitutions, etc. where they
are readily found to be of Men, erected and authorized by themselves.

If any will yet say, their callings and functions are from heaven, let them
show it out of the word of God. Let the^ show (I say) that Christ the Lord has
ordained their offices, entrance, and administration: Their Offices of
Archbishops, Lordbishops, Suffraganes, Cathedral and Rural Deanes,
Prebendaries, Archdeacons, Subdeacons, Parsons, Vicars, Curates, etc. Their
Entrance by the Prelates, by whom they are made Deacons and Priests and
consecrated Bishops, according to their book of ordering and consecration; as
also, their presentation to benefices by the Patrones, and institution by the
Prelates, etc. Their administration of the word, prayer, Sacraments, and
censures, according to their Constitutions, book of Common prayer, Injunctions,
Canons, etc. For this is the way, and this only, to warrant their estate, and
stablish the conscience of such as are troubled about it. Yet this they do
not, but partly by cavils and exceptions against the truth and witnesses of it,
partly by vain pretenses of antiquity and humane authority, partly by abuse
and false gloses of Scripture, partly by reproaches and persecutions of all
sorts, set themselves to obscure the light of the truth now manifested, and to
turn away the people from the knowledge and obedience thereof.

Which is the more lamentable, considering what diverse of them have judged and
written of these things themselves. One thus, T. C. first reply. p. 83.
The Ministry of the Gospel, and the functions there of ought to be from
heaven and of God, and not invented by the brain of men. From heaven (I say)
and heavenly, because although it be executed by earthly men, and the Ministers
also are chosen by men like unto themselves, yet because it is done by the word
and institution of God that has Note this.
not only ordained that the word should be preached, but has ordained also in
what order and by whom it should be preached, it may well be accounted to come
from heaven and from God. Seeing therefore that these functions of the
Archbishop and Archdeacon are not in the word of God, it follows that they
are of the earth, and so can do no good, but much harm in the Church.

Another thus, Demonstr. of Discipl. in the Preface to the Reader.
Albeit many nations that have renounced that whore of Rome, are heynously
sinful against the glorious Majesty of Jesus Christ; yet is there none in the
whole world so far out of square as England in reteyning that popish
hierarchy, first coined in the midst of the mystery of iniquity, and that
filthy sink of the Canon Law, which was invented and patched together, for the
confirming and increasing of the kingdom of Antichrist: Wherein as great
indignity is offered unto Jesus Christ, in committing his Church unto the
government of the same, as can be, by mean underlings unto a King; in
committing his beloved spouse unto the direction of the mistress of the
Stews, and enforcing her to live after the orders of a brothelhouse.

A third thus, Removal of Imputations laid upon the Minist. of Devon: and
Cornwall. page 22.
It is a matter which by all the straynings of men therein employed, could
never yet be cleared, that Provincial and Diocesan Bishops are by Divine
Right, rather then by Humane Policy. We for our parts hold these things
firm: First, that that Church-calling for which the scripture gives no
express warrant, is merely usurped and utterly unlawful. The office of John
(though it were extraordinary) yet we see the care of the holy Ghost, to prove
it by the Scripture, Mat. 3.3^.
This is he of whom it is spoken by the Prophet Esaias. Let any divine tell me
what doctrine he would collect, if he were to preach upon that place. Secondly,
that the Holy writ makes no mention of any such B. as is now amongst us. Show
me (who can) the title Episcopus or Bishop given there to any mortal men in
respect of other Pastors, and not wholly and only in respect of the flock.

And diverse others of them thus, Admon. 1. and 2.
Not only the office of Elders but their name also is out of this English
Church utterly removed, and in stead of them in every Church the Pope has
brought in and they in England yet mainteyne the Lordship of one man over many
Churches. Which Lordbishops being not able (as the Elders) to execute their
offices in their own persons without substitutes, have therefore their under
officers, as Suffraganes, Chancelours, Archdeacons, Officials, Commissaries,
and such like. Also, They with their Canons and Courts are drawn out of the
Popes shop, and take upon them (which is most horrible) the rule of Gods
Church, thrusting away most sacrilegiously that order which Christ has left in
his Church and which the Primitive Church has used, yea robbing the Church of
lawful Pastors, Elders, and Deacons. And, In a few words to speak what we
mean, Either must we have a right ministry of God, and a right government of
his Church, according to the Scriptures set up (both which we lack) or else
there can be no right Religion, nor yet for contempt thereof can Gods plagues
be from us any while deferred. Thus and much more have sundry of themselves
written in former times, how ever it be that now they would seem to plead
otherwise.

But to let them alone, by this may appear how needful it is for all, both
Ministers and people, to take heed to their ways, and to lay them to heart.
Towching the Ministers, it should herein be with them, as it was with John
Baptist, who proved his calling by the word to be from heaven, Ioh. 1.22.23.
with Mat. 21.25. And they that are in deed true Ministers, will have special
care and always be able to show their offices and callings to be of the Lord,
from heaven, approved by his word. So were the Priests and Prophets in the time
of the Law: So were also the Apostles and Ministers of the Primitive Churches
under the Gospel: Yea and Christ himself likewise. And if we may certainly
affirm, that the Christ who cannot approve his calling by the Scripture is not
the true Christ, but a false Christ, and therefore to be avoided,
notwithstanding any truth he professes and publishes: then may we as surely
conclude, that the Ministers which cannot prove their callings by the word of
God are false Ministers, and therefore not to be joined withal, whatsoever
truth they teach or bring with them otherwise. And if the Prophets, Apostles,
John Baptist; and Christ himself would not take this honor unto them, to be
privileged from having and showing warrant of their callings out of the word
of God: who and what are the Ministers of the Church of England, that they
should be exempt from this so equal, so needful, so general a condition? And
if they be not exempt, why are they not ready and careful to show it, for the
satisfying of others, and defense of themselves?

And for the people (howsoever the Ministers do) it should be with them, as it
was with the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and half tribe of
Manasses, who said, God forbid, that we should rebel against the Lord, and
turn away this day from the Lord to build an altar for burnt offering, for meat
offering, or for sacrifice, save the altar of the Lord our God, that is before
his tabernacle. Josh. 22.29. So should all Christians be likewise minded and
say, Far be it from us, that we should rebel against the Lord Jesus Christ,
and turn this day from him, in appointing for our selves (or submitting our
selves unto) any office or calling, for the administration of the word, prayer,
or Sacraments, save only that Ministry which Christ our Savior has
appointed in his word. Of which sort because these Ministers of the Church of
England are not, far be it that we should rebel against the Lord our God, and
turn away from him in receiving of them, in mainteyning or submitting our
selves unto them, by hearing of them or communicating with them in their
Ministry any other ways.

If it be said, that all that these Ministers do, is to the Lord; and that the
things which they do are such as he has commanded, as reading the Scriptures,
teaching the truth, praying, baptizing, etc. yet this does not help them, nor
covers their sin. For besides that which has been spoken before concerning
this point, we may see here by this example, how the Reubenites and the rest
confessed, that although they had built their Altar for the true God, and to
serve him by no other sacrifices then he required, yet their attempt therein
should notwithstanding be rebellion against the Lord, and apostasy from their
God. The same likewise is to be minded for all false Ministeries and devises of
men in the worship of God under the Gospel. For whatsoever things ar written
aforetyme, they are afore-written for our learning and instruction. Romans 15.4.
And hitherto of these Reasons.

Now the God of all grace give us to agree and be like minded in the truth and
syncerity of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: that we may set our hearts to
receive and keep whatsoever the Lord has commanded, and in one accord with one
mouth may praise God even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: To whom be glory
and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

OTHER ARGVMENTS and Reasons, taken out of diverse Books, old and new, written
by the forward Preachers concerning the Ceremonies, Ministry, and government
of the Church of England:
Tending to the same end and proving the same thing with the Reasons here
before alleged, vidz, That it is notlawfull to hear or communicate with the
present Ministry of the Church Assemblies of England.

The first Argument, taken out of Mr W. Br. Twelve Arguments, made by him
against their Ceremonies; and thus applied unto their Ministry.
ALl Will. worship is sin: To hear or communicate with the present Ministry
of the Church Assemblies of England, in Church Service in manner and form
prescribed, is a Will Worship. Ergo To hear or communicate with that Ministry
is sin.
The Proposition cannot be denied, for the Apostle Paul plainly condemns Will
worship.

The Assumption may thus be proved:

All pars of Divine Service and Worship, imposed only by the will and pleasure
of Man, upon the communicants in Divine Service, and that of necessity to be
done, is Will Worship.

But to hear or communicate with the present Ministry of the
Church Assemblies of England, in Church Service in manner and form prescribed,
is 1. a part of Divine Service and Worship, 2. imposed only by the pleasure
and will of Men, upon the Co^municants in Divine Service, 3. of necessity to be
done therein. Ergo,

To hear or communicate with the present Ministry of the Church. assemblies
of England in manner and form prescribed, is a Will Worship.

The Proposition is as clear as the Sun at noone day.

The Assumption has three parts:

1. The first is, That to hear or communicate with the present Ministry of
the Church of England, etc. is a part of Divine worship and Service. Which
cannot be denied.

2. The second part of the Assumption is: That it is imposed only upon the
pleasure and will of man. Which is evident, seeing Man imposes it upon man, and
God has not in his word appointed their Offices callings and administration,
neither required any to communicate with them in Church service, in manner and
form prescribed. Towching which, besides that we have spoken in the former
Reasons, see in their own books what themselves have published: a proof
whereof in sundry particulars we have given both heretofore, and in this
present Treatise.

3. The third part of the Assumption is: That it is of necessity to be done in
Divine Service. Which is also out of all doubt: For the people stand bound to
hear and communicate with them, upon pain of suspension, excommunication,
paying twenty pound a month, etc. and God must have no solemn Worship in
England, except it be in communion with the same.

Upon all this it follows, That to hear and communicate with the present
Ministry of the Church Assemblies of England in manner and form prescribed,
is to do that which is a part of Divine worship imposed only by the will of
Man, etc.

The second Argument, taken out of the same Treatise.
IT is a sin against God for Christians to partake with the Ministry of
such, as accounting themselves to be servants of Jesus Christ, yet do in the
execution of their Ministry, give special Honor to Antichrist and his
Officers. But the Ministry of the Church of England is such, as the Ministers
account themselves to be servants of Jesus Christ, and yet in the execution of
their Ministry, give special Honor to Antichrist and his Officers. Ergo, It
is a sin against God for Christians to partake with the Ministry of the
Church of England.
The Proposition is manifest and clear to any that have an eye of Reason and
any light of Divinity shining in it. For which see, 2 Cor. 6.14-17. Rev. 18.4.

The Assumption has two parts; First, that the Ministers of the Church of
England, account themselves to be servants of Jesus Christ. Which themselves
will freely grant. For here they say, that by way of Excellency they are so.

The second is, that they do in the execution of their Ministry, give
special honor to Antichrist and his Officers. Which is proved (If our
adversaries will grant, that the Pope is Antichrist, and the Prelates
Antichristian officers) by this reason.

Such a conformity to Antichrist and his Officers in the Ministry, as is not
only besides the word of God, but in a special manner derogatorie to all
reformed Churches that have departed from the Synagogue of Rome, is a special
honor to Antichrist and his Officers.

But the execution of the Ministry of the Church of England, is such a
conformity to Antichrist and his Officers. Ergo,

The execuion of that Ministry, in the manner aforesaid, is to give special
honor to Antichrist and his Officers.

The Proposition is without exception.

The Assumption is thus proved:

To execute a Ministry under Antichrists Hierarchy, and that also by virtue
of a calling received according to the popish ordering of Ministers, which is
not only strange from the word of God and the use of all well reformed
churches in the world, but is also drawn out of the Popes pontifical, wherein
he shows himself to be Antichrist most lively; that is to have conformity
with Antichrist and his Officers as is aforesaid.

But such is the execution of the Ministry of the Church of England. Ergo,

It is to have conformity with Antichrist and his Officers as is aforesaid.

The Proposition they will not gainesay.

The Assumption they have granted and published, vidz, That they have an
Antichristian Hierarchy and popish ordering of Ministers, strange from the
word of God and the use of all well reformed Churches in the world; And, that
their Ponticfiall whereby they consecrate Bishops and make Ministers and
Deacons, is nothing else but a thing word for word drawn out of the Popes
pontifical, wherein he shows himself to be Antichrist most lively. Admon. to
Parliam. treatise 2. section 14. and 20.

The third Argument, taken out of the same book of Mr Bradsh. Twelve Arguments,
and out of the London Ministers Exceptions, and Lincolnshire Ministers
Abridgement etc.
IF such be the estate of the Ministry of the Church Assemblies of England, as
they are bound in their Ministration unto such things, as the using of them in
Church Service in manner and form prescribed, is a Will Worship; a giving of
special Honor to Antichrist and his members; a performing of Honor more then
civil (even a Religious) only to an humane Power and Authority; a warranting
of the like use of Jewish, Turkish, Paganish, or Popish observations; a doing
of schismatic Actions; an having of spiritual Communion with the Idolatrous
Papists in the mysteries of their Idolatry and Superstition; a mingling of
Profane things with Divine; an using of unlawful things in Divine worship; an
administering of Sacraments that are not of divine institution; a solemn
acknowledging of spiritual Homage, to the spiritual usurped authority of Lord
Archbishops and Bishops; an using of humane Traditions and Rites enjoined to be
performed in Gods worship, as necessary to salvation; an apparent means of
the Damnation of the sowles of infinite numbers of men, confirming them in
Superstition and Idolatry; a disgracing of the holy Scripture; a profaning of
the Sacraments; an approving of Popish errors, and manifest untruths; an
observing of a Leiturgie which in the whole matter and form thereof, is too
like unto the Massebook, and has in it sundry things contrary to the word of
God, etc. If such (I say) be the estate of the Ministry of the
Church Assemblies of England, then is it not lawful to communicate with them
therein. But such is the estate of the Ministry of the Church Assemblies of
England. Ergo, It is not lawful to communicate with them therein.
The consequence of the Proposition is proved by sundry reasons alleged
Abridgement of the book delivered to his Majesty, by the Lincolneshire
Ministers. p. 17. etc.
by the Lincolneshire Ministers, though urged by them but against the use of
their Ceremonies: which we will now apply unto the communicating with their
Ministry and ministration aforesaid.

1. By the second commandment, which forbids all provocations unto spiritual
fornication, as the seventh does unto that which is carnal.

2. By the commandment and direction God has given us in his word, to
separate our selves from Idolaters and Antichristians, and to be as unlike unto
them as may be, specially in their religious observations; to abolish not only
all Idols but all the instruments of Idolatry, and that so as we may best show
our utmost detestation to them and *root out the very memory of them, etc.
Levit. 18.3.4 and 19.19.27, 28. Exodus 23.24. Deuteronomy. 14.1. and 12.4, 30, 32, 2
Cor. 6.14-18. Apoca. 18.4. Genesis 35.2, 4. Number. 33.52. Deuteronomy. 12.2.3. 2 King.

Exodus 23.13. Deuteronomy. 12.3. Josh. 23.7. Zach. 13.2.

3. By the equity and reasons of these commandments which we find set down in
holy Scripture. vidz, 1. The detestation which the Lord our God (being a jelous
God) bears unto Idolatry and all the instruments and tokens thereof, as unto
spiritual whoredom. Exodus 20.5.6. Deuteronomy. 7.25.26. 2. That we cannot be said
sincerely to have repented of the Antichristianisme Idolatry or superstition
whereby we or our forefathers have provoked the Lord, unless we be ashamed of
and cast away with detestation all the instruments and monuments of it. 2 Chronicles. 33.15. Esa. 1.28.29. and 2. 6.8.9.20. and 30.9.10.11.22. 2 Cor. 7.11. 3.
That we shall be in danger to be corrupted in Religion and doctrine, and to be
brought to ruin and destruction, if we conform our selves to Idolaters and
Antichristians in their Ministry, ministration, ceremonies, and reteyne or
partake with the monuments of their superstition, yea if we show not al
detestation unto them. Exodus 34.12.15. Deuteronomy. 7.4.25.26. Judge. 2.13. Gal. 2. 5.
Rev. 18.4. 4. That our keeping of communion with the Ministers in such
Ministration, will be a special mean to harden them in that ungodliness.
Ezech. 16.54. 1 Cor. 8.10. 5. That seeing the Prelates are reveiled to be great
Antichrists, and their Ministry and constitutions to be great troublers of
the Church at this day, it cannot but be very sinful and hurtful to reteyne
or communicate with them. 2 These. 2. 3.4.8.9.10.11. 12. Apoc. 17. and 18. chap.
Lev. 18.3.

4. By the judgment of the godly learned of all Churches and ages, who have
constantly taught and given testimony to this truth, that Christians are bound
to forsake and cast of the Ministration ceremonies and religious customs of
Pagans Jews Antichristians Idolaters and Heretics, and carefully to shun all
conformity with them therein.

And hitherto of such reasons as are alleged by the Lincolneshire Ministers,
as is aforesaid. Now for further confirmation of the Proposition, I will also
annex these following; being of like nature with the former.

1. The consideration of the many sins, and those also great and grievous,
which ensue upon such practice: as may appear by the particulars noted here in
the Proposition, and prosecuted in their Books.

2. Because the second commandment forbids not only the making, but also
the bowing down to any inventions and constitutions of men in the worship of
God: And this prohibition of bowing down, includes not only those that use
them, but such also as communicate with them therein. Exodus 20.5.

3. Because the Lord requires of us to show all uttermost detestation and
forsaking of them, both by word and deed, even casting them away as menstruous
cloths, and saying unto them, Get you hence. Esa. 30.22.

4. Because the imposition and observation of the things aforesaid, is not
only upon the Ministers, but upon the people also, and that both in their own
persons and in their children. And why should not the people as well as the
Ministers stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made them free, and
not be entangled again with the yoke of bondage? Gal. 5.1.

5. Because the Lord has not required this at our hands, that we should serve
him by such a Ministry and Ministration. Esa. 1.12.

6. And finally, because the Lord has straightly enjoined us to forsake all
humane devises in his worship, and not at all to partake with any of the sins
of Babylon. Deuteronomy. 4. chap. Rev. 18.4. and 22.18.19. Of which sort, both they
and we have proved that these are: as may be seen in their books and ours
written hereabout. And thus much of the Proposition.

The Assumption is proved by Mr Bradsh. in his Twelve Arguments; by the London
Ministers in their Exceptions; and by the Lincolneshire Ministers in their
Abridgement of the Book delivered to his Majesty: page 2-70. etc. compared with
the Canons of Anno 1603. etc. The Arguments and other Treatises of the
Ministers, show the nature and use of the things enjoined to be of such
consequence. The Canons of the Convocation and other Laws and constitutions of
their Church, show that the Ministers are bound to such a Ministration: And
that upon pain of suspension, deprivation, degradation, excommunication, etc.

Whereupon some of them have written, that Removal of Imput. of Devon and
Cornwall Minist. p. 36.
not Paul himself, if he were living, should be permitted to continue his
function, if he would not conform: And, Mr Bradsh. Argum. 11.
the whole Solemn Worship and Ministry of Jesus must stoop and yield to
these; And these must not stoop or yield to them. Which howsoever they apply
most unto their Ceremonies, yet the grounds of their Arguments imply it also
upon their Ministry, and upon the partakers therewith: as may appear by that
which has been said before; and which hereafter follows.

The fourth Argument, taken out of the Admonitions to the Parliament, written
by the Preachers seeking reformation,
IF the Offices of the Archbishops, Archdeacons, Lordbishops, Suffraganes,
Parsons, Vicars, Parish priests, Stipendaries, and the rest of that sort in the
Church of England, be Antichristian and contrary to the Scriptures: then the
people of God may not hear or otherwise partake with their Ministry in the
worship of God. But the Offices of the Archbishops, Archdeacons, Lordbishops,
Suffraganes, Parsons, Vicars, Parish priests, Stipendaries, and the rest of
that sort in the Church of England, are Antichristian and contrary to the
Scriptures. Therefore the people of God may not hear or otherwise partake with
their Ministry in the worship of God.
The Proposition needs no proof. For what communion has light with darkness?
And what concord has Christ with Belial? 2 Cor. 6.14-17. Rev. 14.9-12. and
18.4. and 22.18.19.

The Assumption is their own saying, and their plea for reformation many
years since. Admonition to the Parliam. treatise, 1. and 2. section, 14.18.20.
etc.

The fifth Argument, taken out of the Offer of Conference or disputation,
tendered by some of the silenced and deprived Ministers, to the Archbishops and
Bishops, etc.
IF these Propositions be true, 1. That all matters merely Ecclesiastical,
which are lawfully imposed upon any Church, are such as may be concluded
necessarily from the written word of God: 2. That all humane Ordinances used
only or specially in Gods worship, whereunto they are not necessary of
themselves, are simply unlawful: 3. That every true visible Church of Christ
is such a spiritual Body politic, as is specially instituted by Christ or his
Apostles in the New Testament: 4. That every true visible Church of Christ or
ordinary Assembly of the faithful, has by Christ's ordinance power in it self,
immediately under Christ, to elect and ordeyne, deprive and depose their
Ministers, and to execute all other Ecclesiastical Censures: 5. That the
Pastor of a particular Congregation is the highest ordinary ecclesiastical
Officer in any true constituted visible Church of Christ: 6. That it is the
Office of every true Pastor to teach and to govern spiritually only one
Church or Congregation immediately under Christ: 7. That the Office and Calling
of Provincial and Diocesan Prelates is contrary to the word of God: If (I say)
these Propositions be true, then it is not lawful to hear or have any
spiritual communion with the present Ministry of the Church Assemblies of
England. But the Propositions aforesaid are true. Therefore it is not lawful to
hear or have any spiritual communion with the present Ministry of the
Church Assemblies of England.
The Major is of necessary consequence, and not to be denied: 1. Because their
Ecclesiastical matters Constitutions Offices and Ministration, called into
question, cannot be concluded from the written word of God; but are Humane
Ordinances, never instituted by Christ or his Apostles: And therefore are
unlawful to be received or bowed unto in Gods worship. Exodus 20.4.5. and
23.13.24. Deuteronomy. 12.28-32. 2 Cor. 6.14-17. 1 Timothy 5.22. and 6.13.14. Jude, ver.
3. and 23. Rev. 22.18.19.

2. Because by the consequence of these Propositions, they have not in their
estate either true Churches or true Ministers. And with false Churches and
false Ministers, we may not have any spiritual communion. Hos. 4.15. Amos.
4.4.5. Ioh. 10.5. Reve. 14.9-12. and 18. 4.5.

3. Neither can it be but that such practice must needs imply in them which do
it, that either they hold the Propositions aforesaid to be false (which they
averr to be true) or at least that they walk corruptly and halt between two
opinions. 1 King. 18.21.

The Minor is professed and published by themselves, and offered to be
mainteyned against the Archbishops and Bishops and all their adherents, by the
late silenced and deprived Ministers in England. Offer of Conference, page 1.2.

Where also note, how themselves hold it lawful, upon the Prelates
proceedings, that Offer of Conference, page 39.
both the Ministers and people of the Church Assemblies of England may leave
their ordinary standing in those Churches. Which if it prove not a lawful
separation like ours, it will be found to be a very schism among themselves.

The sixth Argument, taken out of diverse Treatises written in behalf of the
Ministers of Devonshire, Cornwall, Lincolnshire etc. also out of the
Admonitions to the Parliament, and out of Mr Cartwrights, Mr Vdals, Mr Jacobs,
and other of their books, written of like argument.
IF these Assertions be true, 1. That that Church-calling for which the
Scripture gives no express warrant, is merely usurped and utterly unlawful:
2. That as it is not lawful to bring in any strange doctrine, so is it not
lawful to teach the true doctrine, under the name of any other function then
is instituted by God; And, that God has not only ordained that the word
should be preached, but has ordained also in what order and by whom it should
be preached: 3. That the Word of God contained in the Writings of the Prophets
and Apostles, is of absolute perfection, given by Christ the head of the
Church, to be unto the same, the sole Canon and rule of all matters of
Religion, and the worship and service of God whatsoever: And that whatsoever
done in the same service and worship cannot be justified by the said word, is
unlawful: 4. That a true visible Church is a company of men, ordinarily
joining together in the true worship of God: And, that all such Churches and
Congregations, communicating after that manner together, in divine worship, are
in all ecclesiastical matters equal, and of the same power and authority, and
that by the word and will of God they ought to have the same spiritual
privileges, prerogatives, officers, administrations, orders, and Forms of
divine worship: 5. That every established Church or Congregation ought to have
those spiritual officers and Ministers which are enjoined by Christ in the new
Testament, and no other: 6. That the ground of Church Government, is the Kingly
function of Christ, who is the Head of the Church, and whom it properly
concerns to make laws by which to govern the Church. 7. That the Scripture
has delivered an exact platform of Policy for the House of God which is the
Church: And, The word of God describes perfitly unto us, that form of
governing the Church which is lawful; and the officers that are to execute the
same; from the which no Christian Church ought to swarve. 8. That the form of
Church-governement in England is an Humane ordinance; yea and the very same, by
which Antichrist rose unto his intolerable Tyranny in Gods Church. 9. That it
robs the Church of lawful Pastors, Elders, and Deacons. 10. That Diocesan
Bishops have not any place nor part at all in any true and proper visible
Church of Christ. 11. That it is the natural and immutable office of a Pastor
both to Teach and to Govern (with the assistance of other Elders) his own
flock. 12. That the right and true Discipline Ecclesiastical in each proper
Visible Church, is one main part of the ordinary means of salvation
appointed by God for every soul: and that this in the Church of England is
utterly wanting. 13. That Diocesan Bishops, etc. do (by necessary consequence)
deny Christ the Savior to be our entire and perfect Prophet and spiritual
King (by taking away from him some proper parts of his Prophetical and Kingly
Offices), impugn the Foundation of saving faith, and are contrary to Gods
word. 14. That Christ is the only teacher of his Church, and appointer of all
means whereby we should be taught and admonished of any holy duty, and
whatsoever he has thought good to teach his Church, and the means whereby, he
has perfitly set down in the holy Scriptures, so that to acknowledge any
other means of teaching and admonishing us of our duty, then such as he has
appointed, is to receive another teacher into the the Church besides him, and
to confess some imperfection in those means he has ordained to teach us by:
If these Assertions (I say) be true, then is it unlawful to have communion
with the present Ministry of the Church Assemblies of England.

But the foresaid Assertions are true:

Therefore it is unlawful to have communion with the present Ministry of the
Church Assemblies of England.

The Proposition agrees with that of the former Argument, and adds weight
unto it. For, besides that which there is said, it cannot stand with the Homage
due unto Christ the King and Head of the Church; with the sound acknowledgement
of the sufficiency of the Scripture and word of God; with the careful using of
the means of salvation appointed by God for every soul; with the faithful
renouncing of all humane ordinances in Gods worship, and utter detestation of
Antichrist, etc. to have communion with the Ministry of the Church Assemblies
of England: seeing they are not lawful Pastors or Ministers, having the
natural and immutable Offices appointed by Christ, nor performing the worship
of God according to the Canon of his word; but stand in subjection to
Provincial and Diocesan Bishops, receiving their Ministry from them, and
executing it under them, who are contrary to Gods word, and against the
Prophecy and Kingdom of Jesus Christ: etc. So as to hear and communicate with
their Ministry, were to worship God after an unlawful manner, and to
acknowledge other offices and means of teaching and governing the Church, then
such as Christ has appointed: and consequently to receive an other Teacher and
King into the Church besides him, and to confess some imperfection in those
offices and means which he has ordained to teach and govern us by. etc.

The Assumption is their own, acknowledged and confirmed by themselves in
diverse of their books: Namely, The Removal of certain Imputations laid upon
the Ministers of Devon: and Cornwall, page 22. 39. T. C. reply, 1. Page 83.
English Puritanisme, p. 1. 5. 6. 12. 13. 24. The Demonstrat. of Discipl. page 1.
Admonit. to the Parliam. treatise, 1. and 2. Sermon on Romans 12. page 36. 37. Mr
Jacobs Reasons proving necessity of reforming the Churches in England, page 33.
35. 51. 52. 53. The Abridgement of the Book delivered to his Majesty by the
Lincolnshire Minist: page 31. 32. 77. 78. etc.

And let it here be observed, that although the case be thus clear, by their
own writings, against their Church and Ministry: yet Mr. Bradsh. Argum. 12.
London Ministers Protest. Mr Jacobs, Mr Hilders. Mr Stones, and others
writings. etc.
they cease not to impute schism unto us for separating from them in such
estate; they pretend that the main cause of our separation, is because of
their Ceremonies; they hold and plead that the Churches of England, as they be
established by publik Authority, are true visible Churches of Christ; and that
their Ministers, are faithful Pastors, and true Ministers of Christ, etc.
Accusations, pretenses, opinions and pleas, that sort very ill with their
Propositions and Assertions: and are so much the more strange in them, as they
have, besides all the former Positions and many other the like, affirmed
expressly, that they lack both a right Ministry of God, and a right
government of his Church according to the Scriptures; that they have an
Antichristian hierarchy; and a Leiturgy culled and picked out of the Popish
dunghill the Massebook full of all abominations; and that the controversy
betwixt the Prelates and them, is not for a cap a tippet or a surplus, but for
greater matters concerning a true Ministry and Regiment of the Church
according to the word. Which being once established, the other melt away of
themselves. Admon. to the Parliam. treatise, 1. and 2.

Thus have they written and judged themselves heretofore. Now if their Church
and Ministry were altered, it would be known. But seeing it is not, how is it
that they keep not more to the greater matters in controversy; but insist so
much upon the lesser, which would melt away of themselves, if the other were
once established? And why blame they us, for separating from their false
Ministry, unlawful worship, and Babylonish constitution of their Church? Or
why consider they not, that the extent of their Propositions and Assertions
reaches, not only to their Ceremonies, but also to their Ministry,
Leiturgie, and Church it self?

Now therefore if they can make to accord together, their judgment with their
practice, their writings with their walking: it is more then time and needful
that they did it, and that they did it soundly from the word of God. For as yet
what do they else, but with one mouth both bless and curse; and with the one
hand build up that which with the other they destroy, and so make themselves
trespassers? Gal. 2.18.

The seventh Argument, taken out of Mr Bradsh. book aforesaid: vidz, out of the
tenth Argument of that Treatise.
IT is a sin against Christ the sole Head of the Church, to have spiritual
communion with those Ministers, which in the administration of Divine things,
do either by word or deed, solemnly profess and yield a spiritual Homage, to
an usurped spiritual authority in the Church. But the Ministers of the
Church Assemblies of England, do even in the administration of Divine things,
by solemn deed, profess and yield a spiritual Homage, to the spiritual
authority of Lord Archbishops and Bishops, which is usurped. Ergo, It is a
sin against Christ the sole head of the Church to have spiritual communion
with the Ministers of the Church assemblies of England.
The Proposition may not be gainesaid: For all spiritual power usurped over
the Churches of God, is an Antichristian authority, and to communicate with
those Ministers which profess spiritual homage thereunto, is to communicate
with such as profess spiritual homage unto Antichrist, which must needs be a
sin against Christ the sole head of the Church.

The Assumption has two parts:

1. That the Ministers of the Church of England do even in the administration
of Divine things, by solemn deed, profess and yield a spiritual Homage to
the spiritual authority of Archbishops and Lord Bishops.

Which is most evident, because they preach the word and administer the
Sacraments by virtue of their calling received from the Archbishops and
Bishops, who give them authority hereunto at their ordination, saying to every
one of them, Book of ordering Priests fol. 14.
Take thou authority to preach the word of God, and to Minister the holy
Sacraments in the Congregation, where thou shall be so appointed: Which things
themselves cannot deny to be mere Ecclesiastical, Religious and spiritual
Actions, enjoined among them to be done by offices and callings received from
the Prelates Ecclesiastical and spiritual authority: So as the doing of them
by virtue thereof, must needs be a solemn declaration of spiritual homage
yielded to the same authority.

2. The second part of the Assumption is: That the authority of their Lord
Archbishops and Bishops is an usurped authority. The confirmation whereof, Mr
Bradsh. sets down in these words following:

This is sufficiently proved of late by Mr Jacob, in his 1. Assertion by many
reasons. Only because the weight of the Argument leans upon it, I will use
one Reason.

Those Officers and Rulers in the Church that make claim to be of Divine
institution, challenge to themselves Apostolical authority and jurisdiction as
the only Successors of the Apostles; to sit only in Moses chair; To have
sole power of the Keys; To cut from the visible Church, and receive again: To
have power of creating and displacing all other ecclesiastical officers; To be
the Universal Pastors of whole Dukedomes and Kingdoms, under whom all other
Pastors are as Curates, etc. And yet for all this, are such as stand and are
supported only by humane Traditions and Ceremonies, such as a civil
Magistrate may without sin, put out of the Church, and such as the true
Churches of God may renounce (and yet continue the true Church) as
Antichristian Usurpers and spiritual Tyrants: (I say) all such Officers and
Rulers exercise an usurped authority in the Church:

But our Archbishops and Bishops are such Rulers and Officers as are aforesaid.
Ergo,

They execute an Usurped power over the Church.

The Proposition may easily be justified. For if inferior officers, vidz,
Pastors of particular Congregations, have had and may have firm continuance in
the Church, without these humane devises and inventions; If the Magistrate
cannot without sin put them out of the Church; And if those can be no true
Churches that renounce to have particular Pastors and Ministers over them, it
must much more hold in such Church Officers and Rulers as these are, if their
authority be lawful and good: For whilst the Apostles lived, they needed not
any humane Traditions and devises to support their authority: The Magistrates
that sought to put them down sinned with a high hand: And that was no Church,
that renounced and disclaimed their Office, Authority and Jurisdiction.

The Assumption is as easily justified. For 1. they make claim and Title to
all those Prerogatives before rehearsed in the first part of the Proposition,
and unto more then that, as shall be proved if it be denied.

2. It is an Emblem of their own NO CEREMONY, NO BISHOP. Ergo, No humane
Tradition and Invention, no Bishop, Ergo, The office of a Bishop is supported
by them either only or specially.

3. Their Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction is derived from the King, else it is a
flat denial of his Supremacy. Also themselves grant in their last Tables of
Discipline, That the King has power to increase or diminish the Circuit of a
Bishopric: That he may make two or more Bishoprics of one, and one Bishopric
to be two or more: Yea what should hinder but that he may divide the Bishopric
of London into 800. For where God has not defined the number of Parishes that
a Bishop is to reign over, it must needs be a thing indifferent: In which by
their own Doctrines the King has authority without sin, to dispose. If
therefore the King may as well (notwithstanding any thing in the Law of God)
give the Keys of the Church to every particular Pastor of a Congregation,
over his own Congregation, as to a Bishop over a Diocese, which takes away
the very Essence of an English Bishop, He may without sin take away the very
Office of the Bishop, which consists in having jurisdiction over many
Congregations. etc.

4. There is no true and sober Christians but will say that the Churches of
Scotland; France, the low Countries, and other places (that renounce such
Archbishops and Bishops (as ours are) as Antichristian and usurping Prelates)
are true Churches of God: Which they could not be, if the authority and
prerogatives they claim to themselves, were of Christ, and not usurped. For if
it were the ordinance of Christ Jesus, that in every Kingdom, that receives
the Gospel, there should be one Archbishop over the whole Kingdom: One Bishop
over many hundred Pastors in a Kingdom, and all they invested with that
authority and jurisdiction Apostolical which they claim iure Divino, to be
due unto them, and to reside in them, by the ordinance of Christ, certainly
that Church that should renounce and disclaim such an authority, ordained in
the Church, cannot be a true Church but a Synagogue of Satan. For they that
should renounce and deny such, must needs therein renounce and deny Christ
himself. Thus the Assumption is cleared.

And thus the cause is yielded, by themselves: who in their own writings speak
and reason in such sort, as has been showed. Which I thought good thus to apply
to their present estate, and further manifestation of the truth. And thus much
concerning these Arguments and Reasons. Which now I leave to the consideration
of all that are of judgment and conscience: exhorting them as they love the
truth and their own good, 1 These. 5.21. Psalm. 119.59
to try all things by the word of God, to consider their ways, and to turn
their feet into his testimonies.

And I pray the Lord God of all glory and goodness, to discover and consume the
apostasy of Antichrist daily more and more; to make the light and power of the
Gospel of Christ shine forth and prevail against all enemies and hindrances;
and to give his people of all estates and nations to walk in the light and
comfort thereof, to the praise of his Name, and eternal life, by Jesus Christ:
who is God overall blessed for ever. Amen.

Ier. 50.29. Call together the mighty
many against Babel, all that bend the bow, besiege her round about, let there
be no escaping for her: recompense her according to her work, according to all
that she has done, do unto her: for she has been proud against the Lord,
against the holy one of Israel.
