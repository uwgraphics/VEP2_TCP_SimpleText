A rule to know the change, full, and quarters of the Moon for ever, which
ye may do by heart, knowing the Epact.
Look in the table made of purpose, on the other side of this leaf, for the
Epact, which is a number devised to know the change for ever. which number of
Epact, stands under this title Epact, and is right against the years of our
Lord and to know the change of the moon do this, enter the table, and look
for the number of the epact, for that year you would know the change, then
reckon how many months are past from march unto the month you would know the
change, reckoning march for one, and the month you are in for an other, as I
would know on what day of the month of December 1594. the moon changes: the
Epact is xviij. from March to December are 10. months, (reckoning March and
December for twoof the number) which 10. add to the Epact 18. which makes 28.
which 28. also take from 30. so rest 2. on which day the moon changes. Note
that the Epact begins in March. and not in January: so that January and
February be the last in number of the 12. Note also, that if ye numbers amount
unto above 30. the 30, being cast out, the remain that is left must be taken
from 30: if it be under 30, take that also from 30. and the remain is the day
of the change of the moon. Notwithstanding, if there be 31. days in a month,
then take the remain from 30. if but 30. days in the month, then take the
remain from 29. as for example: the Epact 1594. is 18. from March to April 2.
which added is 20. which 20. take from 29. (for April has but 30. days) so
rest 9. so I say the the Moon changes the 9. of april 1594. By which rule
you may know the change always, by heart knowing the Epact.

An other rule for the change of the Moon by the Pryme number.
Look in the table made of purpose, on ye other side of this leaf, for the
golden number, or prime for the year, where you shall find for every year
the several prime or golden number: having found it, look in that month
wherein you will know when the moon changes, for the same prime number, which
prime number stands first in every leaf, under ye name of prime, and right
against that day where the prime number stands, on that day the Moon
changes: as for example, I would know on what day of the month of January
1594 the moon changes? Look in ye table for the year 1594. against which
year stands the prime number which is xviij. the^ turn to January, and
look down along the numbers standing under prime, for xviij which is against
ye xij. day of January, on which day the moon changes, so that by this rule
you shall know when the moon will change any year to come, when you know the
prime number. Note that ye full moon is xiiij. days.18. hours after the
change, the quarter is vij. days ix. hours.
