A SUMMONS FROM A True-Protestant CONJURER, TO Cethegus's Ghost, To appear
September. 19. 1682.
RIse from the Dead Cethegus at our Call,
Lend a kind Vote at our Next COMMON HALL.
Thy Voice of old in Rome was deemed Divine,
Surpassing, our Grand Patron's, Cataline.
"The Ill's we have Committed safe cannot be
"Without attempting Worse for LIBERTY.
Shall we, like Vassals, Fettered be by Law:
We, who of naught that is Moral, stand in Aw?
Shall we (True Israel) by Readiness humbled be?
We, who can scarcely own Theocracy.
Brutus was Brave, and his Impulse Divine,
When first from Rome he chased the Royal Line,
And something liked WE did, ere FORTY NINE.
But those BLEST-REFORMATION-DAYS soon past,
And C -- s RETVRN our blooming Hopes did blast.
On Bishops Lands we SAINTS did Freely feed,
Till Batt, the Vile Apostle made us bleed.
Shepherds and Sheep cashiered; The admitted Goats
Who led our Flocks astray: till up rose O --
O -- Grand Retriever of our REFORMATION,
SAVIOVR of the TRVE-PROTESTING Part of the Nation!
He taught us by his Blessed DISCOVERY,
To form a Method for New Liberty;
And to secure a stronger COMBINATION,
We mildly stild it an ASSOCIATION.
But this Intrigue was stifled in its Birth,
And proved the Abortive of our Teeming Mirth:
This Point thus lost, no Favor can we hope,
(For Ignoramus, Noos'd the JOYNERS ROPE:)
And Long'd-For-Commonwealth is this Day lost,
Unless Retrieved by Brutus, or thy Ghost.
Rise then Cethegus, Dear Cethegus Rise,
PYM, HAMBDEN, STROVD, All Brutus dear Allies;
From Holy MATCHIAVIL, to more Holy HOBBS,
(The Grand DVVMVIRATE for Republic Jobbs)
Rise MILTON, who, to make the Worst-Cause Good,
Did dare Bespatter a Blessed MARTYR's BLOOD:
Rise PETER'S, NOL, SCROOP, SCOTT, Hell's Modern Furies,
Meet Sutan, Fire and Brimstone, and WHIGG-JVRIES;
With ZEAL Hell-hot, outvie VESVVIO's Fires,
Calcining what against our CAUSE conspires:
Without these Aids (no Trust in HOLDER-FORTH)
We Are Gone, Gone, Gone, by C -- LAWS, D -- N.
FINIS.
