To all the Faithful in CHRIST, Who have stood in his Council the Light, to be
led in the footsteps of the Flock of the Companions, and to all that profess
the Light of Christ to be their Guide: To you I write these following Lines, to
be seriously weighed, in the weighty and ponderous Spirit, wherein you may
discern a Discovery of a false Birth, in some, that came forth with us, as to
own the Light, in their Judgments, and go forth from us, in rejecting the
stroke of the pure judgments of God, through the working of the mystery of
iniquity, and so become as the untimely Birth, that does not see the Sun in his
glory, nor the beauty of Sion (who has passed through death unto life) in her
comely unity in the Spirit and bond of peace: He that can receive it, let him,
now in the cool of the day when Council may be hearkened unto, and rightly
understood in the truth, as it is in Jesus.

Printed in the year, 1664.

DEar friends, Called and chosen of God, in the eternal light and power of the
most high, who have been, and are his living witnesses, from the beginning of
the dawning of his powerful and glorious day of his dreadful appearance,
which has caused the earth to shake, and the Keepers of the house do tremble
in this day of your visitation from on high. And all you that in true
watchfulness wait on the Lord, in the measure of his life, you are sensible of
what he did, has done, and does, in the ordering of his dear and tender
children, as in the subjection both of the inward and outward ^an, in every
exercise of the Spirit, as in exhortation, prayer or praises, which the most
high God has and does accompany with his blessed presence, in which he has
made all (that has kept their habitations in the powerful life of the first
Love) to stand as Saviors upon Mount Sion, to gather the scattered of Israel,
and to bring again the dispersed of Jacob: And this is the work of all that are
truly sent of the Lord to labor in his Vineyard, who seeks not their own
things, neither sets up, nor serves themselves with what the Lord has given
unto them, but alone seeks the glory of God, and serves him with uprightness
of heart, in the exercise of all the gifts and riches of his grace, with which
he has clothed them, to the perfecting of his praise and glory, and the
comfort of his heritage for ever: therefore do they shine as the Stars in the
firmament of heaven, in turning many souls to righteousness, in which they
enter into the heavenly habitation of the most high God; where it is known, the
Lord to be one, and his name one, and there alone stands the union of all the
flock of the Companions, who have been truly baptized and buried with Christ in
his death, where we could not cover our naked souls with a Fig-leaf garment of
our own works, or with any self-created gesture, or posture of the outward man,
but in true obedience to the light, waiting in the sense of our misery, crying
out of the great Deep to the God of mercy, who in his appointed time, in his
tender compassions he casts the skirts of his garment over us, and said unto
us, live: In which life we in eternal unity bear our testimony to all the
world in the light of his Covenant, sitting and feeding together at his Table,
clothed with the wedding Garment, where there never was, nor ever shall be any
rent, but eternal harmonious joyful unity, in the everlasting felicity, where
every Child of this inheritance (as moved of the Lord) casts in their Mite, in
the returns of his spirit, offering up the sacrifice of high praises to the
most high God over all, blessed for ever.

Dear and tender friends; This arises in my heart to exhort all that are
convinced of the truth, that every one with diligent watchfulness search your
own hearts with the light, and in it know your own estates, and seriously know
your own conditions, and that you may certainly understand what spirits you are
on, and to have the seal of the spirit of God demonstrating to you in full
assurance, that you walk with him, in true self-denial, according to your
measures in uprightness of heart with all the flock of the Companions, as
before written, then will the Lord give you a sound and perfect judgment, to
weigh and try all spirits, and taste the breath from whence the words proceed,
and not to lay your hands hastily upon any, what ever they pretend, but in that
which tries and weighs your own spirit, in coolness and singleness of heart,
try and taste what spirits they are on that comes amongst you in this day,
wherein many comes forth with us as to the owning of the truth in their
judgments, and regulates the outward man in some outward gestures like to the
children of the truth; and some have felt the stroke of the judgment of the
Lord, which has caused them to forsake some things which forme^ly they
delighted in, and in some measure of zeal have born a testimony to the light,
enduring both stripes and imprisonment, both in this Nation, and some beyond
the Seas, while they stood in the fear of the Lord, who for his names sake has
delivered them from the winter storms that they suffered under; but they for
want of watchfulness, the Mystery of Iniquity has wrought and drawn them from
the light into the pride of their hearts, to deck themselves with the jewels
and gifts of the spirit God gave unto them, when they were humble before him;
but they departing from the redeeming judgment of God, the Beast gets the
deadly wound healed again, and instead of giving glory to God for their
deliveran^^, they in this time of some measure of rest, take their flight on
the Sabbath day, upon the Mountains of their high imaginations, and sacrafices
upon the high places, and does not regard to make their peace with Christ in
them, their Elder Brother, and so to bring their gift to the Altar, in the
humble meek spirit which gathers into unity, and answers to the witness in
every Conscience; but though they pretend zeal and obedience to God, in what
they do; they being gone from the light, they neither regard the glory of God,
nor the good of his people; for all that they now do, is wrought in a
self-serving spirit, where they enter into, the mysterious working of the
deceit of their hearts, to set up, and cover themselves with a voluntary
humility, and feigned love, gathering all the eloquent and enticing words of
man's wisdom, with which they make a flourish in a discoursative spirit,
speaking high words of that they never did know, to get entrance upon the
affections of the tender-harted ones, that are afraid to judge any but
themselves, which others that look more at high words, then to feel from whence
they come, or to know the end for what they are spoken; and these they seek to
overcome with their subtle enticing words, to draw them into singularity, and
self-separation, that they may set them up with admiration, and to carry on
their own Interest, they make use of those they overcome, to seek all occasions
with themselves to speak evil, some both by writing and printing, against those
that God has raised up to keep their habitation, and to stand unmovable upon
the foundation Christ the light, to discern and judge their subtle, crafty,
wicked proceedings, and to lay them open, that they be such as intrude into a
Ministry, and runs when God never sent them, therefore they do not profit the
people at all, for they go not in at the Door, which is the light to be led in
conformity to Christ in his suffering and Death, so come they to be ignorant of
the saving gathering word of eternal life, because they in self-strivings climb
up over the true judgment of God, and in pride and fleshly wisdom pretends
to enjoyments of high things, in a self-boasting spirit, some saying in their
hearts, as it is written, I see, and know, and am rich, and want nothing, when
they are blind, and miserable, and naked, and wants all things, and must come
again to the light, to buy eye salve of Christ that they may see, and raiment
to cover them, or else their nakedness will for ever apppear. For this birth
which is generated in the Mystery of Iniquity (as before written) it cannot
live but in singularity and self-separation, setting up self sometimes in
visible forms, gestures and postures, to be seen d^stinct from others, as
Clouds tossed to and fro, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for
ever, except they repent: for God will make the womb of this births conception,
to be the grave whence again it shall return, and there to be buried to its
eternal consumation, the mouth of the Lord has spoken it, through his servant
that has and does labor day and night, according to the ability of the grace
I have received of the Lord, for the restoration of all those that have been in
danger of destruction, through the snares and working of the enemy (as before
written.) And amongst many, some hearkened to counsel, and have been again
restored in obedience to the light; but who rejected the counsel of God
through his Servants, and desperately goes on in a self-sering spirit, (though
often reproved) they harden their necks, destruction has, does, and will come
upon them, and that without remedy.

Oh! how did my bowels ye^n for the preservation of J. P. in what I could to
have drawn and separated him from that spirit which gave forth the paper that
propagated the keeping on the Hat in prayer, and reflected judgment upon those
that called upon the name of the Lord with their heads uncovered: but after
much counselling of him in tender love, to have stopped that paper from going
abroad; but he would not be separated from that spirit that gave it forth. Then
I cleared my conscience in the word of the Lord, which now (in my freedom in
God) I declare to the children of Sion, what the eternal judgment was, that
did arise in my heart, in words to this purpose. John, if thou propagate what
thou have written in this paper, thou will wound more hearts, and cause more
trouble of spirit amongst the tender hearted people of the Lord, then when the
temptation entered dear J. N. who deeply suffered, but the Lord restored him
again by true repentance: And as to my particular, it is not my nature to be
found striving with thee, or any upon the earth; but having declared the truth
to thee, I will return to my rest in the Lord, and let every birth live the
length of its day, and time manifest what is born of God; for that spirit that
stands up in self-striving, will weary it self, and die, and end in the earth.
And this will certainly come to pass upon all that does not diligently wait in
the light, to judge the outgoings of their minds, and to be led in true
self-denial, which is the footsteps, where the flocks of the Companions
delights to walk, every one serving one another in love, seeking to restore one
another with the spirit of love and meekness, forth of what any have done,
through the violence of temptation or weakness.

Oh! dear friends, feel the yearning bowels of the Lord through me to you all,
in which I beseech you, that what has come so pass in this day of great
trial, and hour of temptation, you may all (in dear love to the Lord of life)
return to his light, to feel his power restoring into a true understanding with
him to walk, in true self denial, where you will feel his presence, filling
your hearts, and binding you up in eternal unity of the Spirit and bond of
peace; every one forgetting all things that is behind, and not anyone stand up
in self striving, but in the tender brotherly love informing the Judgments of
one another in the light and power of the endless life, and in it submit to
the low estate of one another, serving one another in love, which is the
washing one another feet, and here is Christ and his Disciples in eternal
unity, and powerful Dominion, against whom, every tongue lifted up shall fall
in Judgment, and every weapon formed shall not prosper, but come to naught,
for the Mountain of the Lords house shall be more and more set upon the top of
the Mountains, and established over all the Hills, and all the faithful shall
more and more (in eternal unity) praise and magnify his name, in the beauty of
holiness, who sits upon the throne, and lives and reigns for ever and ever.

And dear chosen vessels, who has known; and does abide and keep your state
with God in the perfecting power manifest in your inward man, which truly
buryes self in the death, and has raised you up, and sent you forth in the
resurrection and power of the endless life, which seeks not any thing, but
to glorify the Lord in all your travails, and undertakings, where ever the
Lord calls you.

Oh! you blessed amongst the people; what can be said of the goodness of the
Lord, that has been and will be more and more manifest to you, whose care and
burdens, labors and travels is known to the Lord and your reward is with him
for ever; Dear Brethren, though great be the wrath that withstands the work of
our God, which wrath works openly and mysteriously to lay burdens upon the
innocent, and to add affliction unto the afflicted. In the word of the Lord
that arriseth in my heart, I declare they shall but weary themselves, and all
their hopes shall fail them, and their expectations shall come to naught, who
wait for evil concerning you who love the Lord better then your lives, and
delights to wait to feel his power at all times, leading and ordering in the
limits and bonds of the spirit of the Lord, etc. I know there is of you my
brethren, that need not be written unto in lines of this nature, but to all who
has, or may have their mouths opened in the true motion of the Spirit of God,
and has not yet overcome and escaped the danger, where many have received
loss as before written, with a godly jealousy over you in tender bowels I
beseech you watch and pray, that in the light and power of God you always be
kept; And when any motion of the Spirit of the Lord arises in you, to exercise
the gift God has given you; first search your hearts, and see that you be at
peace with Christ in you, your elder brother, that in the sense of your
peaceable union with him, your hearts be truly broken, and your Spirits truly
humbled and abased before the throne of his glory, in which power bring your
gifts to his Altar, and keep within the bonds of the Spirit, then shall your
Sacrifices (whether it be Exhortation, Prayer or Praises answer the witness of
God in all his people, and God will accept of your faithfulness in the returns
of his own Spirit to his glory for ever: And whatever the Lord do in you or
with you, rejoice not over much in Spirits being made subject, but rather
rejoice in the power that keeps self in the Death; that your names you always
behold written in the Lambs book of life; then will you be full of virtue, as
branches in the Vine of Gods righteousness, whose leaf shall never wither;
but you shall be always fruitful, and your leaf shall be for the healing of
the Nations; and an Eternal Judgment shall rest and abide in you, in the pure
discerning of all the unstable wandering Spirits, that are as before written,
which is the Stars that the great Dragon draws after him from the heavenly
light, and throws them down again to the earth, because (through pride) they
kept not their estate in the meek humble Spirit of the Lord of glory.

Oh! my dear Brethren in the unity and bonds of the meek humble Spirit of our
God, my soul blesses the name of the Lord for you and your faithfulness is as
marrow to the bones of the feeble, and as sinews to the loins of the weak;
therefore let us in the true motion of the meek peaceable Spirit of the
almighty God, go on in his service, and let us wrestle with the most high, in
the prevaling power of his own Spirit, for the bringing again the captivity of
Sion, that they that have mourned before our God with us in years past, may be
restored and brought from the mountains (where they are scattered) into the
light and fold of rest, with us to lie down in the Shepherds tent, where we
find safety in the heat of the day, and in the hollow of his hand, he will keep
us, until the indignation be over part.

Therefore you valiants amongst the people, who in the meek humble Spirit
shines as the Angels of glory; every one be faithful in the power of the most
high God in whom you shall stand as Saviors upon Mount Sion, in your living
Testimony which causes the dead to hear the living voice, the lame to walk,
the blind to see, the dumb to speak forth the high praises of the mighty God,
which shall cause the ears of them that know not God to tingle, and the hearts
of the righteous to rejoice, and for ever glorify the name of the Lord, that
has kept you humble, little and low as to self, but mighty, powerful,
prevailing, in the pure, peaceable, eternal Dominion of which there is no end.

Where my soul rests, who has now given forth what has for some time lain
upon me, to clear my Conscience to all that ever has tasted in any Measure of
the good word of God, and the power of the world to come, that they may
certainly know whether they abide in the Vine of Gods righteousness, yea, or
nay: Therefore, Let them that has an eye to see, let them see; or an ear to
hear, let them hear; or an heart to understand, let them understand, what the
Spirit says to the Churches, in the eternal Judgment and word of truth,
through

Your Brother and fellow labourer in the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Farewell, WILLIAM DEUSBURY.
Send this with care abroad to be read in the fear of God in the assemblies of
the Church of the first born.



The End.
