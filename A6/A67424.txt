TO THE Right Honorable Sir THOMAS DAVIES Knight. Lord Mayor of the City of
London; AND To all the Right Worshipful Society of Senators his Brethren in
this Supreme, Unparaleld, and Renowned Metropolis for Wealth, Beauty, Honor,
and Good Government.
Right Honorable, and Right Worshipful,
MIsconception and Erroneous Tradition, which have so much perverted and
corrupted the radical path and order of Primitive Invention, and almost
obliterated the true Intentions of Antiquity both in Philosophy and History;
have also in this general Infection traduced even Heraldry; witness, the
manifold Errors and egregious Mistakes, which by industrious Enquiry and
sedulous Search, I have discovered in diverse of the Companies Escutcheons, and
Corporations Coats of Arms in this Honorable City of London, since they were
first conferred upon them in the gracious Grants of their respective Patents
under the Great Seals of several Kings of England, committed through the
stupidity and careless performances of diverse Artificers, (viz.) Painters,
Plaisterers, Gravers, and Carvers; whose absurdities are of late advanced in
the most eminent and conspicuous Places of very beautiful and stately
Structures: who were first of all unadvisedly misled by putting faith in false
Copies; such as have been lately, and now are, exposed to public Sale in
Graving and Printing. Which when I had sufficiently considered, I was much
concerned what dishonorable reflections it might cast upon so many Worshipful
Companies and Worthy Corporations; and was troubled to think that those Loyal
Societies, who have so much Truth in their Hearts, should have so much Error in
their Arms, and began to think of a Reformation, which with much care and cost
I obtained by the convenience of surveying distinctly their ancient Patents,
wherein I found in what manner the several Kings of Arms had from time to time
given them their Shields, Charge, Crests, Supporters, and Motto's; which I
forthwith Copied for some, with the examination of Ancient Records for others:
and reduced them to truth and order; in the exactness of Draught and curiosity
of Sculpture; So large, that a judicious Eye with pleasure may behold them; So
true to the Rules of Dimension, Proportion, Correlation, Position, Posture, and
Symmetry, that now they will endure the most curious examinations of the Nicest
Critics, and consequently prove and continue authentic Copies for Futurity;
and also be a likely means to suppress and annihilate all those erroneous
Draughts that have misguided the over-credulous Imitators. And having with
great Charge and Labor thus finished this my Undertaking, and knowing how much
your Lordship and Ye his Brethren concern your selves in Advancing and
Rewarding all Endeavors for the preservation of the Honor of this Famous
City, and the several Societies and Corporations thereof; I cannot but promise
my self that this my Work will be graciously received and entertained by such
Indulgent Patrous, and accordingly be esteemed and valued by the several
Societies and Corporations; to whom, as I have hereby endeavored to express my
Zeal for their Service, so I shall make it the business of my Life to approve
my self

Your Lordships and Worships Most Humble, and Most Faithful Servant Richard
Wallis.

The Preface.
HAving designed nothing to my self in this Work, but the advancement of Truth
and discouragement of Falsehood; and particularly with respect to those
Worshipful Societies and Corporations, that have too long suffered thereby in
their Coats of Arms. I shall not use any artifice to gain the approbation of
Generous Judgments, Accurate Artists, and Curious Disquisitors, to whom I leave
it to certify their enquiries by comparison. The turning over the leaves of
this little Volume of Variety proves not only profitable to the Judicious
Artists, but also delightful to all those Persons of Quality, who sometimes
are pleased to advance Heraldry into the honor of their Recreations; which
indeed is a Contemplation full of pleasing diversities, and agreeable to every
Noble and Generous Disposition; being in substance the most refined part of
Natural Philosophy, while it assumeth also the principles of Geometry, by
putting into use almost every Square Angle and Circle. These Sheets being
orderly fixed upon fine Canvass, and well framed, may prove Ornamental, when
placed in any Magnificent Hall, Gallery, or Beautiful Dining Room, where the
Inquisitive Spectators may be pleasantly entertained with making delightful
Comparisons between the Aptitude of the Arms to the Amplitude of any Trade,
Science, Art, Mystery, Occupation, contained in the Table, of which there are
several Additional Coats of Companies and Societies that never were yet
Engraved or exposed until this present, and were the occasion of much industry
and expense in their Atchievment; besides the patient examinations and careful
corrections of all those that have been Published, which were Erroneous either
in Omission, Addition, or Transversion; although (it may be) they were honestly
designed with good and true Intentions. Which is all I shall say for the
Augmentative and Corrective part of this Work. For Design I shall refer my self
to those numerous compartiments, whose Order and Beauty supply the defect of
Supporters, which are adapted to their respective Coats of Arms, and
diversified from each other. In a word, If the Generous and Judicious are
pleased with this that I have done, I have no further Ambition; If Artificers
will think fit by these Copies to rectify their mistakes, and Critics not be
too rash in charging me with new ones, I am well contented; And after all my
expense and labor, if I can but be a Saver, I shall acknowledge my self
abundantly rewarded, Public Benefit having been the sole end proposed to my
self herein, as it shall be ever the Aim of

Richard Wallis.
