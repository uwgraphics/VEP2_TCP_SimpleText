TO THE HONORABLE Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, in the House of Commons in
Parliament. The humble petition of sundry the Knights, Gentlemen, Freeholders,
and others of the inhabitants of the County of Suffolk, to the number of above
13000.
Humbly Shows,
THat whereas by the blessing of God, his Majesty's grace and favor toward
us, and the long continued labors of this Honorable assembly, many grievances
and burdens both in Church and Common wealth (under which we had a long time
groaned) are removed, which With all humility and thankfulness we humbly
acknowledge; yet understanding that many Bills tending to the honor of his
Majesty, the safety and welfare of this Kingdom have by this honorable
assembly been voted, and now lie in the Lords house unpassed, by reason of the
Popish Lords and Bishop, fitting there is, (as we conceave) by reason whereof
together with the not execution of laws against the Papilts (who
notwithstanding through the providence of God have been discovered and
disappointed in many of their Treacherou, plots against the King and state) hey
and their adherents are still encouraged, and imboldened in their mischeivous
plots and conspiracies, a lamentable experience of whose Treasons and bloody
cruelties, weheare is daily presented to this Honorable assembly, from
Ireland, whosedolefull Condition, your Petitioners do much pity and bewail,
we therefore your Petitioners being greatly distracted and full of fear of
some sudden and cruel design to break out against the peace of the Kingdom,
which puts us into an unsettled Condition and occasioneth a general decay in
trading, tending to the impoverishing of the Nation, unless timely prevented;
And having most of us solemnly protected to maintain the Protestant Religion
against all Popery, and to defend his Majesty's Royal Person, Honor, and
estate, and the High Court of Parliament, and to endeavor the Union and peace
of the three united Kingdoms, do humbly and earnestly pray,

That this Honorable assembly will be pleased to improve all good means, that
the Popish Lords and Bishops, may be removed out of the house of Peers, that
this Kingdom may be secured, and our poor distressed Brethren in Ireland may
be speedily releived, that the laws against Papists may be put in execution,
that delinquents may be punished, and our former Petitions against Bishop Wren,
and our scandalous ministers, may be speeded, and that all burdens in Church
and Common wealth, may be removed, with the causes thereof.

And your Petitioners according to their bounden duty, shall daily pray for a
Prosperous success of this Parliament.

Presented the 31. of January, 1641.
