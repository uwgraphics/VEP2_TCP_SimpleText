BE it known unto all men etc. History has such sorce and virtue that it will
make a man a Traveller that never went 10. miles from home; it will describe
unto him Cities, Countries, Manners, Laws, Customs, Fashions, Wars and Peace
both at Sea and Land, it will give him admittance to speak with his hat on to
the greatest Emperors, Princes, and Poten^ates, and all sorts of people and
Nations that have inhabited the whole world: all this, true and well written
Histories will furnish a man withal in his own chamber. And because great
books are of great prices, and our large Chronicles are of such high rates,
that all men cannot reach to, I have at, mine own cost, written and caused
this Brief to be Printed. Many Writers do make doubts whether this Land had
ever any King called Brute; but the most Authors do affirm, that when Troy
was spoiled by the Greeks, that Prince AEneas fled into Italy, and there he
was married to a daughter of Latinus, King of Tuscany, now the Dukedom of
Florence, by which Lady he had a son named Ascanius, who was the Father of
Silvius Posthumus, and that Silvius was the Father of Brute; Brute being but 15
years old, unfortunately as he in a Forest was hunting, slew his Father
Silvius with an arrow as he shot into a thicket, thinking he hadshot at a
Dear, for which he was banished from that Country, and shipping himself with
a good, or great, number of his followers, he landed here, and was the first
King of this Land. This is the opinion of many grave Writers, but diverse
learned men do oppose those Authors. For my part, I am sure that one King or
other did reign here when this Land was first a Kingdom, and because it
bears the ancient name of Britain or Brutaine, I do hold with su^. Authors,
as for Brute do hold with me.

Anno Mundi 2858. Years before Christ 1108.
1 BRute reigned 24. years: to his 3. sons Locrinus, Camber, and Albanact,
he gave to the first England, to the second Wales, to the third Scotland. 2
Locrine reigned 20. years; he beat the Hunns (or Hungarians) hence, who would
have invaded this land, and their King was drowned in Humber. 3 Queen
Guendoline (wife of Locrine) reigned 15 years, beloved and honored for her just
and virtuous government. 4 Madan reigned 40. years, was eaten by Wolves, as he
was hunting^ he was fierce and tyrannous: he built Doncaster. 5 Mempricius, the
son of Madan, reigned 20. years, and at last (like his father) was devoured by
Wolves. 6 Ebrank, built York, and reigned 21 years: he had by 21. wives, and
other females, 20. sons, and 30. daughters: he lived in the times of K. David
and K. Solomon. 7 Brute 2. reigned 12. years, buried at York. 8 Leile reigned

Cunedague were brothers, and grandchildren to Leire: they ruled together, but
Cunedague slew Morgan at Glamorgan in Wales, and reigned 33. years. 14 Rivallo
reigned 46. years: it rained blood 3. days in his time: Rome was built out of
the putrefaction of the blood that fell: it bred swarms of hornets and
horseflies, that stung many folks to death; insomuch that with famine, and
other calamities, there died so many that they which lived were not enough to
bury the dead. 15 Gurgustus reigned 38. years: a most vicious Drunkard, and his
Brother, 16 Sicilius reigned 49. of both which our Histories make no good
mention. 17 Iago reigned 25. years: a wicked Prince: he died of a sleepy
Le^hargy. 18 Kimmarus reigned 54. years. 19 Gorbo^ug reigned 63. years, as some
write and some write but 42. let the Reader believe as he pleases. 20 Ferex
and Porex were brethren: they were the last Princes of the Race of Brute; Porex
killed Ferex; to revenge which their mother killed Porex, by which means this
Land was without a King, and at division many years, and shared into 5. petty
kingdoms. Some say Ferex and Porex reigned 50. years, and others write but 5.
21 M^lmutius Donwallo reigned 40. years: he was the son of a Cornish Duke,
named Clotton: he brought this Land again into one Monarchy, and was the first
King that wore a Crown of Gold. 22 Belinus and Brennus were brethren, and
shared this Land between them; but (disagreeing) Brennus was forced from hence
into France, from whence he went and wan Italy, ransackt Rome, and at a siege
of Delphos in Greece, he slew himself: Belinus reigned 26. years: he builded
the Port called Belingsgate. 23 Gurguintus reigned 19. years, he overcame the
Danes, he sent many scattered and distressed Spaniards to inhabit Ireland. 24

years, and was buried at Caerleon in Wales. 26 Kimarus reigned 3. years: a
wicked King, killed by a wild Beast in hunting. 27 Elanius reigned 9. years:
histories make little mention of him. 28 Morindus reigned 8. years: he fought
with a ravenous Sea Monster, which had devoured many people, who also devoured
the King, but he killed the Monster afterward, for he was found dead with his
dagger in his hand, in the belly of his devourer. 29 Gorbomanus reigned 11.
years: a good King, built Cambridge and Gra^ham. 30 Archigalo, ^lidurus,
Vigenius, and Peredurus, 31 were crowned and deposed again, and with 32
shusfling fortunes these 4. Kings reigned 28. years.
From the time of Elidurus to King Lud, there reigned in this Land 33. Kings,
of whom Historians do make very various, or little mention, I will therefore
but only name them.

Gorbonian reigned 10. years, Morgan 14. Emerianus 7, deposed.

Ival 20. Rimo 16. Geruncius 20. Catillus 10. he caused all oppressors of the
poor to be hanged. But since that time they have increased much.

Coylus reigned 20. years, Ferex 5. Chirimu 1 he killed himself with excessive
drinking.

Fulgon reigned 2. years, Eldred 1. Androgius 1. Eliud 5. Dodamius 5. Gurginius
3. Merianus 2. Blodunus 2. Capenus 3. Quinus 2. Sillius 2. Bledgabredus 10.
Rodianus 2. Archemalus 2. Eldalus 2. Redargius 3. Samullius 2. Penisellus 3.
Pirhus 2. Caporus 2. Dinellus 4. Helius ( or Elius) 1. From this King the I Will
of Ely had its name.

Of these Kings, 24. of them had very short times of either lives or raigns; 4
of them raignd but 4 years, (that is to say, each of them raignd but one year)
and in that course 11 of them reigned 22 years (to years each, as many years
as Ears) 4 reigned each three years, and one reigned 4 years; 3 had the
happy, or unhappiness to bear the royal toil, hazard and slavery each 4
years. But although Records and Histories are burnt, lost, and falsified, by
the injury of wars, alteration of times, and partiality or flattery of
Writers, that there is no mention made by what means all these Kings did come
to their long homes in so short a time. It is more then conjecturable, that
they died not all in their beds.

64 King Lud reigned 11. years: he named Troynovant, (or this City of new Troy)
Kair-Lud, or Lu^stowne: he enlarged the building of London, from Ludgate
(which he founded for Freemen to lie in bondage) to London stone, which stone
was set up in memory of Lud, 60. years before the Incarnation of our Savior.
65 Cassibelane raignd 17. years: the 2. sons of Lud and Cossibelane filled this
Land with blody contention, that whilst they strived for the mastry, Julius
Caesar came in and mastred them. 66 Theomancius the son of Lud reigned 22.
years: all that I can write of him is, that in memory of his Father and
himself, his statue is on Ludgate. 67 Cimbelinus reigned 21. years: in his
Reign the Heavens did rain the showers, floods, innundations of gracious love
and favor to most miserable Mankind; for in this Kings time our blessed
Redeemer Jesus Christ was borne. 68 Guiderius reigned 21. years: in his time
our Savior suffered; then Tiberius Caesar was Emperor of Rome, and commanded
the known world. 69 A^viragus 28 years, a valiant man; he founded and built
Gloucester. 70 Marius reigned 53 years, he did much for the repairing of the
City of Chester; in his time, it is written, that good Joseph of Aramathea
came hither, and taught the people Christianity at Glastonbury in
Somersetshire; some Writers say that he was buried there, in a Chapel of his
own erecting, of which I saw the ruins and rubbish remaining in the year of
grace, 1649. 71 Coylus the second reigned 55 years; he built Coylchester, and
was interred at York. 72 Lucius was the first King, of any Land a Christian, by
the means and persuasion of godly men whom Elutherius Bishop of Rome sent
hither, the King and People were brought from Paganism to Christianity: Lucius
cast down 28 Heathen Temples, and erected Churches for Gods service. He
reigned 12 years, buried at Gloucester, Anno Christi, 194. 73 Severus was an
Emperor of Rome, he reigned 18 years, he made a strong wall between England
and Scotland, to secure us from the Invasion of the Scots, the wall was 112
miles in length, from the River Tyne to the Scottish Seas. He was slain 78
years of age. 74 Bassianus reigned 6 years, he was Emperor of Rome, and son to
Severus. 75 Ca^rasius reigned 7 years, slain by Alectus our first English
Martyr (Saint Alba^ suffered martyrdom in his time. 76 Alectus was a bloody
Tyrant, reigned 3 year killed by Asclepiodates. 77 Asclepiodates reigned 2
years, as some do write, others relate 30 years; he was all slain by Coil
Duke of Colchester. 78 Coil Duke of Colchester reigned 14 years, h^ married
Hellen who was the mother ^ the Emperor Constantine, she beautifie^ Jerusalem,
with many fair buildings an^ Churches, and she also walled London an^
Colchester, where Coil was buried, An. 315^ 79 Constantius reigned 4 years, a
good King, buried at York. 80 Constantine the great was an English m^ ^orne, he
was Emperor of the Christian world; he was the Founder of Constant^nople,
which was an old ruined Town called Bizantium, he was zealous for God glory,
for which he was honored o^ earth, and doubtless eternally glorified^ He
reigned 22. years. 81 Constantinus reigned 5. years, and his brothe^ 82
Constantius 3. years: these were the sonnes^^ the great Constantine: they
reigned together, and together by the ears they fell, and never agreed till
death made an end of the quarrel. 83 Octavius (as some do relate) reigned 54.
years: he was Duke of Windsor; he was slain by Traherus who succeeded him. 84
Traherus reigned 6. years, An. Dom. 353. 85 Constantius 2. reigned 1. year,
slain by Gratia^. 86 Maximinianus raignd 1. year, slain by Gratian. 87 Gratian
reigned not one full year, was slain: This Land at this time shook off the
Roman oppression, having been vassalls and paid tribute to Rome 483. years,
An.Do. 446 88 Vortiger reigned 6. years: he was an Usurper, and by his
murdering of his lawful Prince Constans, (the son of Constantius 2.) he gat
the Crown, and the peoples inveterate hatred; insomuch that he was forced to
send for Saxons out of Germany to aid him against his own subjects; which
Saxons not only aided, but invaded the whole Land, and Vortiger was deposed,
and afterward he and his Queen burnt to death, by firing of the house where
they lodged. 89 Vortimer the son of Vortiger; raignd 11. years; he was
victorious against the Saxons, but was poisoned by his wife. 90 Aurelius
Ambrose reigned 32. years; a good King, yet was poisoned. 91 Uter Pendragon,
(which in Welsh is a Dragons head) he cornuted a Duke of Cornwall, by
corrupting the Duchess Igrene, on whom he begot Englands and the Christian
Worlds Worthy ( Arthur; ^^er was poisoned by the Saxons, after he had reigned
18. years. 92 Arthur reigned 16. years: he was King of England, Denmark and
Norway. He beat the Infidels and misbeleeving ^aracens in 12. great Battles: he
instituted the Order of Knights of the Round Table at Winchester. He had a
kinsman named Mordred, who (in Arthurs absence) usurped the Crown; but Arthur
fought with the Rebels, slew Mordred their Leader, and in the fight lost his
own life, and won the name and fame to be one of the 9. Worthies; he was
buried at Glastenbury. An. Dom. 541. 93 Constantine, (some have written him the
4. of of that name) reigned 3. years, was killed by his successor. 94 Aurelius
Conanus reigned 33. years: Writers differ much in writing of this King, and the
variation of times that were then: for this Land was divided by the Saxons into
7. Kingdoms, and in the time of 500. and od years following, they had to each
Kingdom these Kings under named; and those Lands, Shires, and Counties
heerunto annexed. 1. Kent, the first Kingdom of the 7. Divisions, had to its
first King Hengist, 2. Esk, 3. Octa, 4. Ymerick, 5. E^helbert, a good Christian
King, he built St. Paul's London, and St. Peter's at Westminster, 6. Eabald, 7.
Ercombert, 8. Egbert, 9. Lother, 10. Edrick, 11. Wi^hed, 12. Edbert, 13.
Edelbert, 14. Alick, 15. Ethilbert, 16. Cuthred, 17. Baldred: These 17. Kings
reigned in Kent 372. years. 2. The South Saxons Kingdom was only Sussex and
Surry: it continued under 5. Kings 113. years: and though Histories do not
mention their deaths, it seems they died naturally, because so few Kings
reigned so long in such cutthroat times as those were. 3. The third Kingdom
was the West Saxons, it endured 561. years: it had 17. Kings, and contained the
Counties of Cornwall, Devonshire, Somersetshire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, and
Berkshire. 4. The East Saxons, they reigned only over Essex and Middlesex; they
continued under 14. Kings 281. years. 5. Northumberland had 23. Kings: it
consisted of 6. Shires and Counties; namely, Yorkshire, Durham, Lancashire,
Westmerland, Cumberland, and Northumberland. It was divided into 2. Kingdoms;
it lasted 379. years. 6. The East Angles bounds, were Suffolk, Northfolke,
Cambridgeshire, and the Isle of Ely: under 15. Kings it continued 353. years.
7. The seventh, last, and greatest, was the Kingdom of the Mercians, it had
20. Kings: it continued 497. years: it contained 17. Counties; Northampton,
Leicester, Darby, Lincoln, Huntingdon, Nottingham, Rutland, Cheshire,
Staffordshire, Oxfordshire, Worcestershire, Glocestershire, Shropshire,
Bedfordshire, Warwickshire, Hartfordshire, and Buckinghamshire: All this while
I find that the Welchmen held their own; for there is no mention that any of
those wrangling petty Kings had possession of so much as one Village in Wales.
95 Vortiporus reigned 4. years, an incestuous Prince, with his Wives
Daughter. 96 Malgo reigned 5. years; he murdered his Wife, and lived
incestuously with his brothers Daughter. 4. Learned men were sent from Rome
hither, to convert the Idolatrous Heathen Saxons, from Paganism to
Christianity: their names were Augustine, Melltius, John and Justus. 97
Careticus reigned 3. years, and being oppressed with the Saxons, he fled for
saie^y into Wales, where he died. 98 Cadwane reigned 22. years, he tamed the
Saxons of Northumberland. 99 Cadwallin reigned 48. years, a brave victorious
Prince: he was buried in London at St. Martins Ludgate. 100 Cadwallader
reigned 3. years, a valiant and virtuous King: he was the last King of this
Land called Britain till his time, for then it was, and not till then, named
Anglia, and the men English men. Cadwallader went to Rome, and died there. 101
Athelstane was a valiant noble Prince: he reigned 15. years, he brought this
Land to be but one Kingdom again, after it had been divided into 7. near
600. years: he was Crowned at Kingstone, and buried at Malmsbury, Anno Dom.
940. 102 Edmund reigned 5. years: he was son to Athelslane, slain, and buried
at Glastenbury. 103 Eldred reigned 9. years: the Da^es were entered here and
oppressed the people, and banished him: he was buried at Winchester. 104 Edwin
reigned 5. years, was crowned at Kingstone; he was deposed for being an
incestuous ravisher of his own kinswoman, and murdring her husband. 105 Edgar
reigned 16. years, he was brother to Edwin, (by birth, but not by nature) Edgar
was crowned at Bathe: he was a vigilant, a valiant, and a pious Prince, he had
a navy of 3000. ships (as some have written) to scowre the Seas from Enemies
and Pirates, he built, and repaired of Churches and Religious Houses, the
number of 47. He took 8. petty Kings of Wales prisoners, and they Rowed him in
his Barge on the River Dee, to his Parliament at Chester: buried at
Glastenbury. 106 Edward reigned 3. years, crowned at Kingstone, murdered by his
mother in law, and his unnatural brother Etheldred, buried at Shaftsbury. 107
Etheldred reigned 38. years, he caused all the Danes to be slain, or expeld
out of England, he was buried in St. Paul's London. 108 Edmond (surnamed
Ironside) reigned 2. years, Canutus King of Denmark came with a mighty power
of Danes, to revenge their Nations being banished and killed in the time of K.
Etheldred, but Edmond and Canutus co^bated singly, with condition that the
Surving Victor should have all the Kingdom: The Royal Combatants fought
gallantly, till through many wounds, and much blou^ lost, they fell both down
in each others arms, and embraced: Then they agreed, that the Kingdom should
be divided into halfes between them, and the longest liver take all; which
agreement they lovingly kept till a Traitor named Edricus, murdered K. Edmond;
for the which the Danish K. Canutus, put Edricus to death with most grievous
exquisite torments. 109 Canutus reigned 20. years, buried at Winchester, An.
Dom. 1038. 110 Harold the first reigned 3. years. 111 Hardicanutus reigned 3.
years: This King was given so much to excessive drinking, that he drank
himself to death at Lambeth: in joyful memory whereof the merry Hock Mondaies
were kept ye^rly, with dancing, and friendly meeting of neighbors, which some
(that have been mistakingly thought wise) have judged to be Popery. 112
Edward, called the Confessor, reigned 23. years; he freed this Land from Danish
slavery, having no heir, gave his Kingdom by Will, to his Kinsman William
Duke of 113 Normandy, but Harold^ crowned himself King, and in the ninth month
of his reign, Duke William came, killed, and unkingd King Harold.

Thus ended the Reigns of the Britains, Romans, Saxons and Da^s in this
Land, from the year of the Wo^lds Cre^^ion 2858. before the birth of Christ
1108. years, which was 1150. years: then (by Deed of Gift, some write by
Conquest) William the first came hither, after a bloody battle, near Hastings
in Sussex, with the slaughter of 70000. men on both sides, the Norman Duke was
crowned an English King on Christmasse day following: he had a troublous reign
21. years.

Henry 2. reigned 34. years, in much unquietness. One of his sons named
Jeffrey was trodden to death in a throng at Paris: also his son Henry he caused
to be crowned King in his own life time, which afterward vexed him much: and (to
load him with more afflictions) his wife, with his sons Richard and John,
raised Arms against him; he died in France, buried at Fonteverard, 1189. 119

At this time there was scuffling for the Crown, Robert Baliol had the
possession, and David the second expeld him, their Reigns are uncertainely
written.

100 Robert 2. was the first King of the name of Stuarts 1371. he was a good
King, reigned 19. years. 101 Robert 3. reigned 16. years, a good King, whose
life was full of affliction, hiSonne Prince David was famished to death by
rebels in Scotland, and his son James was 1^ years prisoner in England. 102
James the first, reigned 13. years, after hi^ 18. years imprisoned in England,
he w^ slain by traitors. 103 James 2. reigned 24. years, slain. 104 James
3. reigned 29. years, slain at Ban^ nockburne field. 105 James 4. reigned 25.
years, slain at ^lod^don field. 106 James 5. reigned 29. years, a good King.
107 Mary daughter to James 5. her reign wa^ sull of trouble, she was beheaded
at For ^ringham Castle, after 18. years thra^ dome. 108 James 6. reigned 36.
years in Scotland, ^ most Learned peaceable King.
England had 33 Kings before Scotland had any^ the number of our Kings were
138, whereof 2; did not die natural deaths; for 7 were slain, 6 were murdered,
4 were poisoned, one was burnt, 2 fled the Land, one was beheaded, one dyed
with drinking, one was banished, and one^ deposed.

The Kings of Scotland were in number 108. whereof 21 were slain, 19 murdered,
3 killed themselves, 4 died in prison, 4 beheaded, 3 drowned, 1 banished, and 3
deposed. Thus of all the Scottish Kings, only 50 dyed naturally, and 58 by
casualties.

By this short relation may be perceived that the top of Honor is slippery,
and most unsure, where is not to be expected any sure footing, or endurance of
standing. For the King of Kings, being the Great and only Disposer of Kings and
Kingdoms, has in his just indignation (for the peoples transgressions) turned
and overturnd Monarchies, Principalities, States and Commonwealths. The
Assyrian Monarchy began with confusion, and mouldred away to the Persian. The
Persian glory was swallowed in the ravenous Gulf of a Grecian Conquest. The
Grecian (like a violent Blaze) was no sooner in but out, was graspt into the
hands of the triumphant Caesar's. The Roman Greatness overthrew it self, with
its own weight; insomuch that whereas it formerly had all, it has almost lost
all. Our England has had his share in changings and alterations: first, by the
Britains; secondly, by the Romans; thirdly, by the Saxons; fourthly, by the
Danes; fifthly, by the Normans; and now lastly, (by the permission of God) by
our selves. There have been Commonwealths translated into Kingdoms, as Israel
and Judah, and Kingdoms turned into Commonwealths; Italy is now divided into
more then one, nam^ly Venice, Genoa, Luca, Pisa; Also the Sw^zers, or
Helvetians, are a free State. So are^ greatest part of the Netherlands. And
since it^ the Almighties unresistable will to change the Nations Rule and
Government, from a 5. or^^ times changed Monarchy, into a Republiqu^ I will not
repine against divine providence, b^ as I was a faithful servant and subject
45. y^ to two Kings, (who were good Masters to m^ so now I must obey the
present Government, ^^ else I must not expect that I should live und^ it, or be
protected by it.
