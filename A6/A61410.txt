His Voice they hear, John 20. 20-28.
his Scars survey,

" Is by my Father given.
" Go therefore teach the Nations all Ver. 19.

HYMN IV.
WHEN the ancient World God's Patience tried, Genesis 6. 5, 6, 7.

And long his threatening Vengeance dared, 1 Pet. 3. 19, 20.

The Righteous Noah Favor found,
His Family alone was spared. Genesis 6. 8, 9.

In secret Chambers of the Ark
They all secure from Danger lie, Chapter 7. 11-24.

When the Ocean's Banks were broke, and Floods
Burst through the Windows of the Sky.
Proud Waters over the Mountains roll, Ver. 19.

And common Ruin widely spread;
Yet the blessed Patriarch's House survives, Ver. 23.

When all Mankind beside were dead.
At the Almighty's awful Word Chapter 8.

The obsequious Floods retire again;
And Noah from his mystic Tomb
Peoples the ruined Earth with Men. Chapter 9. 1.

So to restore a World overwhelmed 1 Pet. 3. 21.

With Guilt and Misery, Ephesians. 2. 1, 2.
dead in Sins
Our SAVIOR rising from the Grave, Romans 5. 24.

Another Race of Men begins; Col. 3. 10*

New Creatures of a Heavenly Form, 2 Cor. 5. 17*

Whose Souls his Sacred Image bear; Chapter 3. 18.

While dead to Sin, they live to God, Romans 6. 11* 12.

And spotless in white Robes appear. Rev. 3. 5.

Buried in their Redeemer's Grave, Romans 6. 3.

With Him they live, with Him they rise; 1 Ioh. 5. 1^*

While the lost Race of Human Kind Ver. 19.

To see his Face, and sing his Praise. Rev. 5. 9* 10.

HYMN V.
THUS was the Great Redeemer plunged
In Iordan's swelling Flood; Mat. 3. 13.

To show he would one day be baptized
In Tears, Heb. 5. 7.
in Sweat, Luke 22. 44.
and Blood.
Thus was his Sacred Body laid
Beneath the yielding Wave; Col. 2. 12.

Thus was his Sacred Body raised
Out of the liquid Grave.
When lo! from Realms of Light and Bliss
The Heavenly Dove comes down, Mat. 3. 16.

Lights on his venerable Head,
Which Rays of Glory crown.
While his Eternal Father's Voice
An awful Joy excites; Ver. 17.

" This is my well-beloved Son,
" In whom my Soul delights.

In thy own Footsteps tread, Mat. 3. 15.

We die, Col. 3. 1, 2.
are buried, rise with Thee
From Regions of the Dead.
O may the Spirit of Truth and Love
His Power on us display, Ioh. 14. 17.

Approve our Vows, Ephesians. 4. 30.
and seal our Souls
To the Redemption-Day!
HYMN VI.
O Blessed Redemer! Ioh. 19. 34. 35.
in thy Side
Upon the Cross was made a Wound,
The Bath where we are purged from Sin, 1 Ioh. 1. 7.

And where our Guilt's entirely drowned. Mic. 7. 19.

Water and Blood hence freely ran, 1 Ioh. 5. 6.

And on the trembling Earth were spilt; Mat. 27. 51.

Water to sanctify and cleanse, Tit. 3. 5.

Blood to atone for Crimson Guilt. Heb. 9. 22.

This wondrous Grace to represent
Baptismal Waters were designed, Act. 22. 16.

In which thou, LORD, Mark 1. 9.
was it buried too,
To thy great Father's Will resigned. Mat. 3. 15, 16.

Thus Penitents who die to Sin,
With Thee are buried in thy Grave; Col. 2. 12.

Thus quickened to a Life Divine, Romans 6. 4, 5, etc.

Their Souls a Resurrection have.
And tho their Bodies turn to Dust,
This Holy Symbol does assure, Luke 14. 14

The Resurrection of the Just
Shall render them all bright and pure. 1 Cor. 15. 42, 43, 44.

Made like his Body ours shall be, Phil. 3. 21.

HYMN VII.
WHEN from Egyptian Slavery
The Hebrews were redeemed, Exodus 14.

The parted Seas and covering Cloud
A Grave to Israel seemed:
But soon the joyful Tribes emerge,
And stand upon the shore,
With grateful Hearts and tuneful Tongues
Their Savior's Name adore. Exodus 15.

He made the obsequious Waves retire, Exodus 14. 16.

His Favorite Tribes to save;
Made them a way to Liberty, Ver. 26, 27, 28, etc.

Where Egypt found a Grave.
Thus Jacob's Sons baptized of old
To Moses in the Sea, 1 Cor. 10. 1, 2.

Saved by God's Arm, Exo. 20. 2.
themselves devote
His Statutes to obey. Chapter 19. 4-9.

So from the Bondage of our Sins, Romans 6. 11-18.

Redeemed by Sovereign Grace,
We through his watery Sepulcher
Our Savior's Footsteps trace. Mat. 3. 13, 1^.

Our Sins, the worst of Enemies,
Are buried there and drowned; Col. 3. 5.

To a new Life our Souls are raised, Gal. 2. 20.

With tender Mercy crowned. Col. 2. 13.

To thee, O Jesus, may we live, Romans 14. 7, 8, 9.

Devoted to thy Fear;
Thee will we love, Thee will we praise, 1 Ioh. 5. 1, 2, 3.

And all thy Laws revere.
HYMN VIII.
THE Great Redeemer we adore,
Who came the Lost to seek and save; Luke 19. 10

Went humbly down from Iordan's Shore, Mat. 3. 13.

To find a Tomb beneath a Wave.
" Thus it becomes us to fulfill
" All Righteousness, Ver. 15.
he meekly said:
Why should we then to do his Will
Or be ashamed, or be afraid?
With Thee into thy watery Tomb,
LORD, it is our Glory to descend;
It Is wondrous Grace that gives us room
To lie interred by such a Friend! Romans 6. 3, 4, etc.

But a much more tempestuous Flood
Overwhelmed thy Body and thy Soul; Heb. 5. 7.

That Is plunged in Tears, Luke 22. 44.
and Sweat, and Blood, Mat. 26. 38

And over this black Terrors roll. Chapter 27. 46,

Yet as the yielding Waves give way,
To let us see the Light again:
So on thy Resurrection-Day
The Bands of Death proved weak and vain. Acts 2. 24.

Thus when Thou shall again appear, 1 Cor. 15. 52, 53.

The Gates of Death shall open wide;
Our Dust thy powerful Voice shall hear, Joh. 5. 25.

Shall rise and triumph at thy side.
These now vile Bodies then shall wear
A glorious Form resembling Thine; Mat. 17. 2.

To be dissolved no more shall fear, Rev. 20. 14

But with immortal Beauty shine. Chapter 22. 3, 4.

HYMN IX.
WHEN famed Bethesda's Waters flowed, Ioh. 5. 2, 3, 4.

By a descending Angel moved;
The wondrous Pool a sovereign Bath
For every Pain and Sickness proved.
Hither distempered Crowds repair,
Hither the Feeble, Lame, and Blind;
The first who steps into the Spring,
Leaves his Disease and Pains behind.
That languishing and dying Souls
A nobler Cure might freely meet,
The Son of God came down and stirred
Baptismal Waters with his feet. Mat. 3. 13, 14.

LORD, it is but just we follow Thee, 1 Pet. 2. 21.

Who did not scorn to lead the way,
Where we just see the Vale of Death, Romans 6. 3, 4, etc.

Then view the Resurrection-Day.
Happy! who haste into the Flood
Where healing Virtues ever flow, John 5. 7.

Where filthy Lepers clean are made, Isa. 53. 4.

The Blind to see, the Lame to go; Mat. 8. 16, 17.

Where contrite Spirits heal their Wounds, Isa. 61. 1.

And broken Hearts assuage their Pain; Chapter 57. 15.

The Dead themselves new Life inspires, Ioh. 5. 25.

They breathe, Col. 3. 1.
they move, and rise again.
With lowly Minds, and lofty Songs,
Let all admire the Savior's Grace,
Till the great Rising-Day reveal 1 Ioh. 3. 2.

The immortal Glory of his Face. Rev. 1. 16.

HYMN X.
IN such a Grave as this
The meek Redeemer lay, Mat. 3. 13.

When He, our Souls to seek and save, Luke 19. 10.

Learned humbly to obey.
See how the spotless Lamb
Descends into the Stream! 1 Pet. 1. 19.

And teaches Sinners not to scorn
What Him so well became. Mat. 3. 15.

His Body sanctifies
The salutary Flood, Romans 6. 3, 4, 5.

And teaches us to plunge our Souls Act. 22. 16.

In The Fountain of his Blood. Rev. 7. 14.

Oh! Sinners, wash away
Your Sins of Crimson Dye; Isa. 1. 18.

Buried with him, Col. 2. 12.
your Sins shall all
In dark Oblivion lie.
Rise, Col. 3. 1, 2.
and ascend with Him,
A Heavenly Life to lead,
Who came to rescue guilty Men
From Regions of the Dead. Heb. 2. 14, 15.

LORD, Isa. 38. 5.
see the Sinner's Tears,
Hear his Repenting Cry;
Speak, Isa. 57. 15.
and his Contrite Soul shall live;
Speak, Gal. 5. 24.
and his Sins shall die:
Speak with that mighty Voice,
Which one day wide shall spread
Its Summons through the Earth and Sea, Ioh. 5. 25.

To wake and raise the Dead. Rev. 20. 13.

HYMN XI.
SEE in what Grave our Savior lay, Col. 2. 12.

Before he shed his precious Blood;
How he marked out the humble way
To Sinners through the mystic Flood. Mat. 3. 13, 14.

The Sun of Righteousness his Beams, Mal. 4. 2.

Tho so divinely fair and bright,
Immersed in Iordan's swelling Streams,
Submitting to this Holy Rite.
O Jordan! honored often before!
What greater Glory would thou have,
Than CHRIST descending from thy Shore,
To find in thee a liquid Grave?
Thy Streams retired on either side, Josh. 3.

To the Holy Ark once formed a Way;
A Prophet's Mantle could divide
Thy willing Streams, taught to obey. 2 King. 2. 8.

Plunged by the Holy Baptist's Hand,
Buried in thee our SAVIOR lies:
Did not thy Waters wondering stand, Psalm. 114. 5.

To see Him die, and see Him rise?
Blessed Sepulcher! where JESUS lay,
Which JESUS for us sanctifies!
Blessed Flood! Act. 22. 16.
to wash our Sins away,
And sink 'em so as never to rise. Chapter 2. 38.

HYMN XII.
Whenever one Sinner turns to God,
With contrite Heart and flowing Eyes,
The happy News makes Angels smile, Luke. 1. 57.

And tell their Joys above the Skies. V. 10.

Well may the Church below rejoice,
And echo back the Heavenly Sound:
" This Soul was dead, Luke 15. 32.
but now is alive;
" This Sheep was lost, but now is found.
See how the willing Converts trace
The Path their great Redeemer trod; Mat. 15. 3.

And follow through his liquid Grave,
The meek, Mat. 11. 29.
the lowly Son of God.
Here in the Holy Laver plunged, Tit. 3. 5.

Their Souls are cleans'd from every Stain;
They die, Gal. 2. 19.
descend into the Tomb.
By Grace they live, Col. 3. 1, 2.
and rise again.
Here they renounce their former Deeds, Act 19. 18.

And to a Heavenly Life aspire: Romans 6. 3.

Their Rags for glorious Robes exchanged, Zech. 3. 3.

They shine in clean and white Attire. Rev. 3. 5.

O Sacred Rite! Chapter 19. 8.
by this the Name
Of JESUS we to own begin; Act. 19. 5.

This is our Resurrection's Pledge, 1 Pet. 3. 21.

And seals the Pardon of our Sin. Act. 2. 38.

Glory to God on high be given, Luke 2. 14.

Who shows this Grace to sinful Men:
Let Saints on Earth, Rev. 7. 9-12
and Hosts of Heaven,
In Consort join their loud AMEN.
FINIS.
