2. His Paternall providence over the godly in their greatest frailties, in
the progress, tutoring them in the Sanctuary, why he does, and they should
patiently bear with sinners. Surely thou did set them in slippery places,
thou castedst them down into destruction v. 17. etc.

3. The profit accruing to the righteous by Gods ordinances and afflictions,
their Profession to adhere to God alone: in life to have none but him, in life
and death to make choice of him as the strength of their heart, when their
flesh and heart fails, and their Portion for ever v. 26.

Angels are our Court-de-Guard, but yet, nor Sea nor Soil, nor men, nor Angels
can bound our desires, nor is there creature in heaven or earth, can terminate
our affections, or give a sufficiency unto our Souls. The creature is without
us, or were it within us, by reason of its vacuity being but a puffe-past, it
cannot fill us. The serious study, clear knowledge, and deep meditation of
sublunarie creatures, and celestial bodies, does marvelously affect man's
fantasy: his senses are not seldom drowned in such profound contemplations,
yet never satisfied: his reading is wearisome to the flesh, the more he
drinks, the more his thirst increases; in much wisdom is much grief, and

text, as the East is from the West. There are not a few in the world, who so be
it they may have pleasure for their breakefast, and the world to their dinner,
fear not to sit with the devil at supper. Their hope of heaven, and
happiness on earth, is (as they dream) to want nothing of what their immense
desires covet, and to be full masters of their carnal designs. What is that
you hunt after, and pursue with such greediness? is it the splendour, and
beauty of gold that draws your affections? O then how much more pains should
thy soul employ to purchase his favor, whose incomparable beauty fills the
heavens, and splendour dazles the eye of Angels Fratres cogitate: omnia ista

? The crystal glass of Scripture, wherein the anticke postures, and
monstrous shapes of sin are to every pure eye discernable, presents the love
of the world to our full view vested in such hellish weeds, as may make us
run from her as from an infernal fury, and is able to fire it out of our
souls: 1. For the nature and root of it, its Idolatry, and Adultery. 2. For
the fruit and blossom of it, it permits not the love of God to grow or thrive
near it. 3. for the body and bulk of it, its prepared to be cut down, and
thrown into hell fire. 1. The love of the world, and the things of the world,
is Idolatry: Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth,
fornication, and covetousness, which is Idolatry, Colossians 3.5. The
covetous man, who is an Idolater. Ephesians 5.5. Howsoever men are of opinion
that worldly mindedness is a small sin, not worthy naming, yet the holy
Ghost gives this character of it, that it is a sin so great and odious as it
is not fit to be once named, much less nourished and practiced among

over-spreading sin of avarice marches. The abomination whereof is

covetousness; as the glorious Majesty of God is highly provoked by the one, so

and dangerous to those who so offend Vt avaritiam rem periculosam esse doceret,

shame confess, wheresoever the love of earth flourishes, there the love of
heaven withers.

This is that which brings the axe to the root of this tree Matt. 3.10.
, that it may be cut down, and thrown into the fire, which is the third and
last thing observable, how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the
kingdom of God? Mark 10.24. How hard is it for them that trust in riches to
enter into the kingdom of God: verse. 25. the case is very difficult in the
former, but in the latter desperate: yet with God all things are possible,
verse. 27. the words are worthy to be weighed in the balance for resolution of
doubts, and solving of questions: the Jews customarily resorted unto their
Prophets Stella in Luke 18.24.
; Saul seeking his fathers asses, repaired to Samuel the Seer 1 Samuel 9.9.
; David desirous to build the Lords house, conferres of the intention with the
Prophet Nathan 2 Samuel 7.2.
; Abijah being very sick, Jeroboam sends to the Prophet Ahijah 1 King. 14.2.
: and this young man, ignorant of the way to heaven, resorts unto Christ that
great Prophet, to unburden his mind Matt. 19:16.

) seeing Christ leaving the place, he being loath to lose so fair an
opportunity, he came running unto him in haste, kneeled down to him, in humble
reverence, and asked him, good Master, what shall I do, that I may inherit
eternal life Mark 10.17.

learn the way, then to try his Tutors skill in cases of conscience Nec voto

. The Lord that he might discover unto himself the deceitfulness of his own
heart, and unto the whole company and College of Disciples the deceitfulness
of riches, exhorts him to the contempt of the world, by two forcible arguments,
the love of perfection, and the gain of eternal happiness Amore

Matt.
: If thou will be perfect, go and sell all that thou have, and give to the
poor, and thou shall have treasure in heaven: Luke 18.22. but mark the
sequel: The sound of these words, sell all, and give away to the poor, no
sooner came to his ear, but presently his heart was wounded with the dart of
sorrow, which at the very instant showed it self, not only in his face, but
in his feet also, for he went away sorrowful at that saying: verse 23. No
doubt, as the manner of his coming bred in the standers by an expectation of
the event, so this unexpected and strange departure of his begot admiration. He
who came to know, finds knowledge a burden in the very first lesson; he who
drew their eyes unto him, draws them after him: he who seems ambitious of
heaven, now leaves it behind him being proffered: he who came with joy,
returns with sorrow, whose by-your-leave, was civil, his farewell unmannerly:

prize in his hand, but the fool had no heart Prove. 17.16. In dimidio

, All these have I kept from my youth: he talks of his keeping all; Christ
preaches a sermon of forsaking all, or else he cannot be his Disciple. Luke
14.33: And this was it which grieved him, and grieved him so far, as he was
for the time distracted with sorrow, forgetting Christ, himself, Heaven, and

; saying he was sorrowful, sad and grieved, yea very sorrowful: as if they
wanted language to express his indignation arising from his grief, menacing a
Tempest against Christ: his torment and vexation of spirit, his fretting and
chafing mind, viewable in his dogged countenance, which he cast to the ground,
when he went away, as Murtherous Caine did, resolving revenge upon his
righteous brother Abel. And the cause of all this passion was, he was rich, and
was unwilling to leave his possessions for heaven Notum est illud Ciceronis.
Avaritiam, non solum Spartam serdidisse. offic. lib. 2.
. As he turned his back on Christ, Christ turned his face to his disciples,
and looking round about, to eye the observance men made of this passage, and to
gain attention to his ensuing instruction, he breaks out into admiration,
verily I say unto you, how hardly shall a rich man enter into the kingdom of
heaven? Here he declares three things. 1 that its hard: 2 most hard: 3 in some
sort impossible for a rich landed-man, a moneyed-man (...), Luke. 18.24. (...)
Mat. 19.
to get to heaven.

1. Its a hard thing for a rich man to enter into heaven, because its a hard,
and rare thing for a rich man to be a righteous man. Piety and the pelf of
iniquity are seldom inmates Luke 16.9. Amor divitiarum, nec amicitiam, nec

, newly entered into the world, was so far in love with his gold Dominum non

, that for the enjoyment of it, he forsook his God, how hardly will they be
converted unto God, who are waxen so old in the world, as their mind fails in
all things, but the world, and have no memory, but for their money? If he who
only held his own possessions could not follow Christ, How difficultly do
they get to heaven, who withhold other men's possessions Quod si divites
simpliciter difficile salvantur, quid facientrapientes? nam si sua non dare
impedimento ad regnum est, quantum sibi contrahitignem, qui aliena occupat.
Chrysostom. in Matt. 19.
?

2 It is not only hard, but a very great and exceeding difficult thing for a
rich man to enter into heaven: as trusting in uncertain riches, more then in
the living God: 1 Timothy 6.17. which hardship to enter, he who has the keys of
David, and shuts and no man opens, thus illustrates. It is easier for a camel,
to go through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the
kingdom of God, Mat. 19.24 Nam citius tenuis, per acus transire foramen
Deformis poterunt immania membra cameli, Quam queat ut dives, coelestia regna
videre. Iuvencus l. 3. Histor. Evang. Biblioth. Patr. Tom. 4. page 15. Namque
foramen acus, sicut penetrare camelus, Membrorum pra mole nequit: sic dives

limina callem. Sedul. lib. 3. oper. paschal.
. which elegancie of Christ has tortured many of the learned to expound and
express: some whereof level at a mystery in the words, others adhering to
the history, nor are they certain themselves, who hits the mark, or who
misseth the mystery. Some by the camel, understand Christ our Savior who
bore our burden for us, the eye of the needle, the bitterness of his passion,
and the sense to be, its easier for the god of the world to suffer for
worldlings, then for worldlings to convert and turn to God Facilius Christum
pati pro dilectoribus seculi, quam dilectores seculi ad Christum posse
converti. Cameli autem nomine se intelligi voluit, quia humiliatus onera
sustulit: per acum autem punctiones significat, per punctiones dolores in
passione susceptos: foramen ergo acus, dicit angustias passionis. S. Aug. tom.
4. quaest. Euangel. lib. 2. cap. 47. Acus est punctio, per quam angustia

19.
: were this all, the disciples question were not material, who then can be
saved? Matt. 19.25. nay rather, who can be saved otherwise, then by Christ's
death and passion, which he did undergo for oursinnes? Others refer it to
the Gentiles S. Ambros. 10.4. in Luke 18. S. Origin. in Mat. 19. S. Chrysostom. opus
imperfect. in Mat. 19. Anselm. in Matt. 19.
: whose humble entrance through the needle of repentance Foramen acus est
confessio fidei quae in Christo est, vel poenitentia. Pascasius Ratbertus in
loc. Mat. Biblioth. Patr. tom. 9. pars 2. l. 9.
, was more easy unto Christ then that of the proud Jews: who were swollen with
the pride of their Primogeniture and parentage John 8.39.
: and stood so much upon the punctilio of their own righteousness, that they
were not capable of the righteousness of Christ Divitem populum Judaicum
dixit, qui cum divitijs de Aegypto exierunt, Camelus autem nos fuimus. Arnob.
Afer. annot. in loc. Mat. B. Patrum. to. 15. page 165.
. Others believe that Christ had an eye to all sinners in general, who in
their own estimate, were rich and increased with goods, and needed nothing,
but knew not that they were wretched, and miserable, poor, blind, and naked.
Rev. 3.17. sooner may a camel go through the eye of a needle, then such proud
Pharisees enter into heaven Pharisaeus ille, arrogans in prece jactan
innocentia, praesumptor gloriae, exprobrator misericordiae, praedicator sui,
criminator alieni, qui magis conveniret dominum quam rogaret. S. Ambros. in
Luke, 18.
.

And lastly, some interpret Christ's words of Judas Iscariot in particular
Arnobius Afer. B. Patrum loc. cit. Theophilus Antiochenus B. Patr. tom. 2. page
151.
, who selling his master for a price sold also therewith his soul to the
devil. Concerning the Historical part of the words, there is also the like
variety. Some have found out a certain gate in Jerusalem, called by the name
of the needles eye, which was so low and strait that no camel could pass
into the city through it till he was unburdened, and stooped down upon his
knees, at his entrance Maldonat. in Mat. 13. Anselm. in Mat. 12. Chymnitius
Ha^m. in loc.
. Semblably, no rich man, who is unclean, crooked, proud S. Origin. loc. cit.
Avarorum denotat miseriam, quibus divitae magis sunt oneri, quam usui, and non
sibi sed alijs bajulant. Ferus in Mat. 19. Sic divites, cum deposuerint gravem
sarcinam peccatorum, and totius corporis pravitatem, intrare possint per
angustam portam, and arctam viam, quae ducit ad vitam. S. Hieron, in Mat. 19.
, can enter into heaven, till he unlade, bow, and be washed in the Jordan of
Christ's blood, and cast away the bunch of sin, and corruption that presses
down, and cleaves so fast: Heb. 12.1. But this story of the new found gate,
we leave in the midst, as a needless conceit. Others expound the camel to
be a cable, the needle, the Anchor (...), Camelum, and funem significat per
escriptum (...) Suidas in vocal Mihi placet haec sententia. Chymn. Harm. cap.
131. in loc. Mat, Ante foramen acus penetrabit nauticus arctum Funis, quo
proras anchora iacta tenet. Achilles Bochius in Emblem. lib. 2. Symbol. 34.
Mariana in loc. Mat. (...) forte (...) scribendum, nam antiquus character
litterae m. idem erat cum charact^e literae B. cui cognatum quod hebraei
compedem (...) appellant, sit hoc arbitrarium non certum, Drusius in Mat.
19.23. praeterit.
: and the going through the eye of the needle, the bending the cable to the
anchor: which as it is performed with some labor and difficulty; so its a
great work for rich men to get to heaven. These please themselves in their
fancies, but are far from the genuine verity, and soliditie of the text Suo
iudicio sapientes, funem nauticum intelligi volunt, in quorum sententiam lubens
concedam; si unicum saltem probati authoris test monium adduxeriat, qui latinum
vocabulum hac significatione usar paverit. Zehner Adag. Centur. 4. Adagium 86.
.

For 1, were it no greater hardship for a worldling to enter into the kingdom
of God, then to bend a cable to an anchor, they need not much fear or doubt
their salvation, seeing the Saylor effects that with a little help every
voyage: nor would the Disciples so greatly have wondered, as though few rich men
could be saved, seeing some of them being Fishermen, had often performed that
work; and all of them had been so often shipped with their Master, as they
could not be ignorant of the facility of it.

2. Seeing the Scripture is not of any private interpretation, 2. Pet. 1.20.
and the Pillars and Lights of the Church Clemens Alexand. Chrysostom.
Theophilact: August. Hieron. Ambros. H^lar. Inven^us, Sedulius, and alij prope
innumerabiles. (...). Suidas in Nom.
have ever closely stuck unto the letter of the text, understanding thereby
that Creature which is called properly a Camel; we are not easily to be
withdrawn from their sweet harmony.

3. Howsoever there is a paranomasie or likeness of words, as though they were
one and the very same in sense and sound; yet the Orthography (...), n. and i.
(...) autem significat (...), Crassum funem nauticum, non (...). Suid. in loc.
cit.
, and the Original declares them to differ as far as the East is distant
from the West, Vocabulum etiam Syriacum. (...), and Hebraicum (...), ex quibus
originem trahunt voces Graeca and Latina (...), and Camelus, significat
iumentum ejus nominis, non funem. Lege etiam Drusium observationum. lib. 1.
cap. 11. Matthaeus Hebraicus, hic etiam retinuit animantis nomen Gamal, quod
non est ambiguum, sed anchoram (...) appellant, quod navim remoratur. Aretius
in loc. Mat.
.

Lastly, some unfold it of the difficulty, not of the impossibility thus; as
a Great Cable, being untwisted, and taken asunder, may go through the eye of
the smallest stitching-needle, one small thread after another: So may the rich
man, when he is unwound, and converted, enter through the strait Gate into
Heaven Siquidem si funis resolvatur in tenuasua filamenta, facile sensim
traduci potest. Chymnit. in loc Mat.
. But seeing when the Cable is untwisted it cease to be a Cable, so that it
passes not through the needles eye, as a Cable, but as a Thread, there is no
cause to accept this explication, which has no strength in it like the Cable;
but it is rather weak and slender as a Thread.

The words then used by Christ, are an Adage, or Proverbiall kind of speech,
declaring the wonderful difficulty of the thing, whereof it is used, or rather
the impossibility Hac sententia non difficultas intrandi, sed impossibilitas
ostenditur; Pascatius Ratsbertus in Mat. 19. B. Patrum. To. 9. pars 2. l. 9.
Quod primo difficile dixit, id ipsum progrediens Cameli atque acu^ comparatione
valde impossible ostendit. Chrysostom. in Mat. 19. Hoc dicto ostenditur, non
difficile esse, sed impossible. S. Hieron. in Mat. 19.
. It Is taken from a trite. Proverb among the Jews; No Elephant can go through
the eye of a Needle Non est Elephas, qui intret per foramen acus. Drusius
observat. lib. 1. cap. 11. (...), Lucian. Citius quinque Elephantos sub ala
tega^. Zechn. Ad. 86. Cont. 4.
, and he rather mentions the Camel, then the Elephant, because the Camel was a
Creature better known in Syria to the Jews, and the scope of the Proverb was
no whit altered by the change of the name, but rather strengthened Drusuis loc.
citat. Sic oculum posuit pro dentibus, dum Hebraeorum adagium, Exime ex
dentibus tuis festucam. Exime ex oculis tuis trabem. Mat. 7.3.
. Nor is it to purpose to make inquiry how a Camel can go through the eye of
a needle, seeing the more absurd and impossible the phrase seems, the greater
Emphasie it bears Maldon. in loc. Mat.
, and more confirms this truth, that there is nothing in the world harder then
for a rich man to attain happiness and salvation, which is the only aim and
level of this hyperbolicall exaggeration Sicut Camelimem bra non capiunt
foramen acus, propter acus angustiam, and corporis sui tumorem: sic nos viam
coelorum non capimus propter angustiam, and opum facultatumque tumorem.
Euthymius.
: which, his Disciples rightly understanding, received the doctrine with
admiration Futurorum raritas, ex difficultate intelligitur. Hilar. cancu. 19.
in Mat. 19. Vbi difficile ponitur, no impossibilitas praetenditur, sed raritas
demonstratur. S. Hieron. in Mat. 19.
, who then can be saved? Mat. 19.25. Why? are all men rich? Survey the world,
and it will appear, how the poor lie in the valley, like the army of the
Midianites, as Grasshoppers in multitude, like their Camels without number, and
as the Sand which is by the Sea side for multitude Judges 7.12. Cum pauci sint
divites, in comparatione multitudinis pauperum: intelligendum quod omnes qui
talia cupiunt, in little numero haberi animadverterint. St. Aug. in Mat. 19. To
4. quaest. Evang. l. 1. c. 26. Anselmus in Math. 19.
: whereas the Rich in every place are few, and like Gedeons army a very
handful. Thereby they both discover the spreading leprosy of Avarice, which
over-runs all, poor and rich, and also the fearful dangers, whereinto they
plunge themselves that desire and would feign be rich 1. Tim. 6.9. Maldonat.
in Mat: 19.
, though they cannot, as well as such as Covet riches and attain them.

Several men are hindered from Heaven by several sins. Pride and ambition
withdrew Absolon, Obstinacy Pharaoh, Cruelty Nimrod, Idolatry Ahab, but
Covetousness all men, whiles all look to their own way, every one for his
own advantage, and for his own purpose Esaias 56.11.
, for all seek their own, and not that which is Jesus Christ's, Philip. 2.21.
Wherefore, seeing from the least of them unto the greatest, every one is given
unto covetousnes Hieremi. 6.13: Videlicet intelligentes in eo numero deputari
etiam illos, qui quanquam talia non habeant, tamen habendi cupiditate
rapiuntur. S. Aug. loc. citat.
, and all deal falsely, not without cause of admiration was this quaere
broached, Who then can be saved Non quaerant sibi comites ad supplicium, nec
gaudeant quia plures inveniant, non enim propterca minus ardebunt, quia cum
multis ardebunt. Non est enim hoc sanitatis certum consilium, sed malevolentiae
vanum solatium. S. Aug. tom. 10. Homil. 50. cap. 5.
? Where comes the third and last branch to our eye, the Impossibility of the
rich covetous man's Salvation. Hear their sentence from the mouth of the Judge;
Neither Thieves, nor Covetous shall inherit the Kingdom of God, 1. Cor. 6.9.
for this ye know, that no covetous person has any inheritance in the Kingdom
of Christ and of God, Ephesians. 5.5. A hard Sentence, but this is our hope, it
will never be executed says flesh and blood. Be not deceived (says the
Spirit. 1. Cor. 6.9. Versetur ante oculos Imago futuri Judicij, atque ascendat
homo adversum se tribunal mentis suae; atque ita constituto in cord iudicio,
adsit accusatrix cogitatio; testis conscientia, Carnifex timor. Cogitet quam
sit contremiscenda illa poena, qua percipientibus alijs vitam aeternam, alij in
mortem praecipitantur aeternam. S. Aug. Tom. 10. Hom. 50. cap 4. A^re
impossibili ostendit quid sperandum sit de divitibus per se, Aret. in Mat. 19.
) this is a vain hope, these are vain words, deceive not your selves, and Let
no man deceive you besides with vain words; for, for such things comes the
wrath of God upon the children of disobediencek. This Impossibility arises
two ways; First, from the nature of men; Secondly, of money.

1. The rich man relies upon no other means for Salvation, but his Christ, his
Coin is preferred before Christ Non aliter genus nostrum servari potuit, quam
per Christum ex dei scilicet ordinatione; ideo necessari^ ea egit; and passus
est Christus quae passus in assumpta natura est. Cyril. lib. 10. Thesaur. cap.
3.
, How hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the Kingdom of
God? Mark 10.24.

2. He loves his worldly goods, before his God, and is more sorrowful to part
with his heaps then with Heaven. This young man's great possessions put him into
his great passions; He went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions,
Mat. 19.22. he was very rich, Luke 18.23. Dives i. e. divitijs nimium deditus.
Mariana in loc. Possidens divitias cum amore. Ansel. in Mat. 19. Pro. 11.28.
Amorem rei possessae, arguit dolor amissae. Ferus in Mat. 19. Tu vero tristaris
pulverem dans, ut acquiras vitam aeternam? Basil. Princeptiste, vini recentis
capax non fuit, vetus uter existens, sedtristitia ruptus est. Cyril.
, the old vessel of his soul being rotten with the puddle water, and rust of
his wealth, burst in pieces with the new wine Christ put into it. Every one
will boast Chrysostom. in Mat. 19.
of his love to God; but when the storm of adversity makes him a looser, his
sorrow for his losses proclaims, where his treasure was, there was his heart.
The world never wanted such richmen Tales se multos vidisse divites dicit
Basilius, qui and jeiun. verint, and precibus operam dederint, and de peccatis
suis ingemuerint, caeterum ne obulum quidem pauperibus dederint: (...),
quamcunque religionem ostendentes, quae sumptu careret. Musculus in Mat. 19.
, as would mourn for their sins, fast, pray, and seem religious, and be great
Professors, upon condition they might keep their riches, and serve God with
that which cost them naught 2. Sam. 24.24. Difficulter and cum dolor terrenas
opes relinquimus. Origin in Mat. 19.
.

3. He waxes Proud Iste Adolescens, and Dives est, and superbus. S. Hieron. in
Mat. 19. Pauci suas cupiditates fraenant, in calicentia, quam pecunia dat
Mariana in Lucae. 18. Divitem hic appellat, cupidum rerum temporalium, and de
talibus superbientem. S. Aug. Tom. 4. quaest. Evang. lib. 2. cap. 47.
, of his increase and abundance, whereby he becomes an abomination unto the
Lord, so that he beholds him a far off, his great Babel having made him a
very bruit beast. He is weighed in the balance, found too light; the Kingdom
of Heaven is taken from him, and he cast out among the unclean, into utter
darkness Impossible hominem servari qui humanis tantum paesidijs nitatur.
Tossan. in Mat. 19.
.

A just recompense; Seeing he refused the Kingdom of God with sorrow, which is
righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost Romans 14.17.
, he should dwell in the sorrows of an eternal night. Many are destroyed by
reason of gold, and have found their destruction before them: it is a stumbling
block to them that sacrifice unto it, and every fool is taken therewith.
Ecclus. 31.6.

Secondly, in the nature of money, two things enlarge the impossibility.

First, it is Chooke-weede and thorns that overtop and destroy the life of
saving Grace Adolescens habuit multas possessiones, id est, spinas and tribulos

; Gold is dug out of barren Mountains, kept in Iron Chests, and makes a
barren steely heart, wherein the seed of grace can take no root.

Secondly, as the same food which breeds obstructions, and quenches natural
heat; kindles an unnatural fire that consumes the Body: So Riches, as they
dead the love of God, so they inflame the heart Nec unquam magna voce
praedicare cessabo, accessime pecuniarum, cupiditatem habendi magis atque magis
adeo inflammari, ut rerum copia crescente, paupertas quoque augeatar. Nam qui
majori desiderio ardent, egere se magis sentiunt. Chrysostom. in Mat. 19.
with a love of of themselves, which increases as riches do increase: Nor are
they half so dear and near unto the heart, whiles they are desired, as when
they are enjoyed Nescio quo autem modo, cum super flua and terrena diliguntur;
arctius adepta quam concupita constringunt. Aliud est enim nolle incorporare
quae desunt, aliud jam incorporata divellere, illa velut cibi repudiantur, illa
velut membra praeciduntur. S. Aug. Tom. 2. Ep. 34. Therasiae.
. Men covet them as means of their welfare, but part with them, as members of
their bodies; yea, the greedy mind is as much tormented at the loss of a
Groat, as with the pain of a Gut, and if it be required to dispense something
before his death, he answers with the Daemoniacke, art thou come to torment
me before the time Mat. 8.29. Magis enim volumus a dipisci etiam ea, quae male
desideramus, quam liberari a desiderijs malis: and magis volumus ut non
incidamus in ea quae arbitramur esse timenda, quam deponere inimicum amori dei
timorem. Origin. in Mat. 19.
? He that has one pound in his purse, covets a talent; when he enjoyes that,
he desires a thousand, ten thousand after that, and thus his cheverall soul
stretches, till he wishes mountains, rivers, earth, heaven, and all things
metamorphosed into gold, and himself the lord of it Montes, terram, maria
cuncta sibi aurum fieri precatur, eo furoris genere insaniens, quod nunquam hac
ratione de primi polest, Chrysostom. in Mat. 19. Facilius namque est, hominem
volare qua^ acquisitione ac accessione pecunia cupiditatem habe^di terminare.
idem ibid.
. In which dominion, where is his honor, what his gain, when the total sum
of all his accounts amounts to this; With men it is impossible for a rich man

. Poverty is not the direct way to heaven, nor riches the straight path to
hell. Lazarus rests not now, because he was a beggar; nor is Dives tormented,
because he thrived in wealth Non illi pauperi meritum esset inopia, sed
justitia: sed ut nobis oslenderetur nec in isto paupertatem, per seipsam
divinitus honoratam, nec in illo divitias fuisse damnatas, sed in isto
pietatem, in illo impietatem suos exitus habuisse. S. Aug. ibid.
. But the piety, and patience of that man found mercy, and the merciless
pride, and contempt of the other, was rewarded with condign severity. Heaven
was never offended with any man, because he had riches, but because he was had
of riches; not as he was wealthy, but as he was wicked with his wealth Habere
criminis non est; sed modus in habendo retinendus est. Nam quomodo impertiendum
est, and communicandum, si impertiendi, and communicandi materia non

Sed periculosa cura est, velle ditescere: and grave onus innocentia subit,
incrementis opum occupata. Hilar. Canon 19. in Matthew.
. He that commands the rich man's hand to do good and communicate, opens his
liberal hand toward them, whereby they are enabled to do good. He enjoynes
not the casting away of our goods Divitiae utilius humiliter tenentur, quam
superbae relinquuntur. S. August. Ep. 34.
, but forbids the casting away our affections upon our goods, and coveting
other men's. There is a divorce from the wealth of this world, in action, and in
affection or affectation.

The divine all-searching eye is pleased better with the poverty in spirit,
then penury or vacuitie in the purse. Behold we have forsaken all (says Peter
of himself and his fellow-disciples) and followed thee, what shall we have
therefore? Mat. 19.27. a great all! What, Peter, have thou left behind thee
Grandis fiducia. Petrus piscator erat, dives non erat, cibos manu and art

Non tantum erat quod reliquerat Petrus, quaquam viro pauperi ac tenuis fortunae
aeque grave est retia sua, vel tuguriolum relinquere, ac divitibus sua palatia.
Origin. Hieron.
? a Net, a boat, an oar, a shed of reeds? a great patrimony, possession: he
that has nothing may soon forsake all. The knot is easy to untie, seeing the
Lord regards more the affection, then the act of renunciation Nec inspicit
Dominus quid relinquamus, sed quo animo and studio. -- Et revera omnia
contemnit, qui non solum quantum potuit, sed etiam quantum voluit habere
contemnit. Sed in eo quod cupiebatur oculi Dei testes sunt, in eo quod
habebatur, and hominum. S. August. Tom. 2. Ep. 34. Therasiae.
: and the poor fisher man may be as covetous in his pinnace, as the potentate
in his lordly palace; The widows mite, as grateful to Gods treasury, as the
worldlings million. So that the Apostles forsook all, when for Christ they
renounced all, as well in affection Multum deseruit, qui voluntatem habendi
dereliquit, a sequentibus tanta relicta sunt, quanta a non sequentibus
desiderari potueerunt. Gregor. Hom. 5. in Evangel. Ber. in declamat. Multum
reliquit, qui sibi nihil retinuit. Anselm. in Mat. 19.
, as possession, and withdrew their hearts from the world, as well as their
bodies, and hands, from their pristine mundane employments. Thus Abraham
forsook all, when he sacrificed the heir of all Quem suarum divitiarum, and
sperabat, and optabat haeredem. S. Aug. Tom. 2. Ep. 89. quaest. 4.
. And the children of Abraham forsake all, when their conversation is without
covetousness, and are content with such things as they have: Heb. 13.5. When
they do take heed, and beware of covetousness: Luke 12.15. and this rejection
of this world, opens a door for the rich man's reception into heaven, whiles
the rich become poor in spirit Sed considerandum, quod eo tempore quo
intraverunt, divites esse desierunt; tam diu ergo non intrabunt, quam diu
divites fuerint. St. Hieron. in Mat. 19. Et qui prius curvi erant, and vitiorum
pravitate distorti ingrediantur portus Jerusalem. idem eodem.
, and the camels bunch of their worldly affection is eaten off, that they may
enter in at the strait gate of salvation Christus cum adhuc esset in carne
Zachaeum divitem in regnum coelorum misit, and resurrectione atque asscentione
glorificatus multos postea divites impertito Spiritu sancto fecit hujus mundi
contemptores. and finita divitiarum cupiditate ditiores. S. August. Tom. 2. Ep.
89.
. And as the Hebrews passed through the red sea in safety with the riches, and
jewels of the Egyptians, into the land of Canaan; in like manner the same hand
is able to carry the rich and mighty men of this world: through the Jordan of
Christ's blood, into the Land of the living.

Let not the rich man despair Non enim ideo dictum, ut quasi ab impossibilibus
deterrearis, verum ut cum magnitudinem virtutis perceperis, facilius rem
aggrediaris, deumque ores propitium tibi fore, ut ejus open aeternae vitae
praemia consequaris. Chrysostom. in Mat.
, hearing of the difficulty, but rather strive to increase in holiness and
righteousness, as his riches increase, that he may inherit durable happiness.
For as the multitude of camels, which did bring gold and incense, entered into
the city of Jerusalem; Esaias. 60.6. so the dew of grace can first load men
with the treasures of the left hand in this world, and after that bring those
laden camels through the needles eye of a holy life, unto the treasures of Gods
right hand, where are pleasures for evermore. This is the Lords doing Non enim
ait quod hominibus impossible videtur, facile est hominibus si voluerint, sed
quod hominibus impossible est, Deo facile est, ostendens, quando ista recte
fiunt, non fieri hominis potentia, sed Dei gratiae. S. Aug. tom. 2. ep. 89.

Quod enim hominibus impossible est, non ipsis, quia ipsi homines sunt, sed
Deo facile est, idem. Mirifica and misericordissima pollicitatione respondit,

, and its wonderful in our eyes. So then it is not of him that wills, nor of
him that runs, but of God that shows mercy. Romans 9.13. But as for such as
will be rich in this life, when they have stolen the golden apples out of the
paradise of Gods providence, and filld their bellies and backs with this hid
treasure, with these good things; then comes death to drive them out with the
shaking blade of Gods indignation, and then whose shall those things be? And as
this young man went away sorrowful Non abijt convitijs Christum petens, ut
Pharisaei, (...), sed (...), mestus.
from Christ, so shall eternal sorrow chain them up in darkness.

: but Christians (alas!) and substantial professors, even these day-birds

, or mare-maide, would live both in the sea, and upon the sand, in the waters,
and in the woods, in the meadows, and in the maine, in heaven and in earth, in
one part like a Saint, in another like a sinful worldling.

These are not unlike to Mercury Natal. Commit. Mythologiae. lib 5. de Mercurio

, whom the Egyptians pourtrayed with his face, in one part as black as pitch,
in the other as bright as the Sun, because as the messinger of the Gods he
was one while in heaven, and anon in hell. Now their face is toward the
heavenly Jerusalem, and within a while their eyes, affections and minds, are
fixed upon the world with the reprobate multitude Cesset omnis excusatio
errorum, auferantur peccandi foeda solatia. Nihil omnino agimus, qui nos per
multitudinis exempla defendimus, and ad consolationem nostram aliena saepe
numerantes vitia, de^ esse nobis dicimus, quos debeamus sequi: ad illius
exemplum mittimur, quem omnes fatemur imitandum. S. Hieron. ep. 14.
. It may be they are of that opinion, that the stepping into the Temple upon
the Lords day, or hearing a devout sermon once a week extraordinary, is a just
compensation for their base worldliness, as Juno Fabulati sunt fontem fuisse
apud Argivos, cui Canatho nomen fuit, in quo proditum est, Junonem ubi
quotannis se laverit, denuo virginem fieri. Not. Commit. Mytholog. lib. 2. cap.

conceited, her washing once a year in the fountain Canatho renewed her
virginity, and made her a perfect maid, as at the first. But whatsoever they
dream, when Mammon has rocked them asleep, when they are thoroughly awakened,
they shall find inward terrors of conscience, scandals to the Gospel,
universal deadness in religion, stupefaction and lethargy of grace spring,
and without out preventing mercy a dilapidation of the soul, and turning out
of the warm sun of Gods favor, into the chill shadow of Gods indignation,
scarcely to be recovered Audenter loquar, cum omnia possit Deus, suscitare
virginem non potest post ruinam: valet quidem liberare de poena, sed non vult
coronare corruptam. S. Hieron: ad Eustochium. ep. 22. De anima verius dictum

. And howsoever the covetous is now called liberal, and the churl religious,
yet the day of separation In ipsis gregibus sunt boni and mali, sed commixti

Throne of his own holy spirit, as it is the punishment of greediness

and quanto amplius habuerit, plus requirit; and neque copia, neque inopia

soul espoused to Christ, which ever tasted the joys of the marriage bed,
scorns not to pick up roots and nettles, Eccles. 3.11.
to defile herself with the bread of fools, and the dung of beasts? David
having made some deviation in his affection from God toward the world, brings
in his own accusation, So foolish was I and ignorant, verse. 22. I was as a

In Christ's garden my soul delights to walk, her desire is to sit upon his

to me is both riches, honors, and never ending pleasure Lucas Osiander in
loc. Benedict. Arias Montanus in loc.
. To keep this holy fire alive in thy breast, consider three things: 1 the
motives, to persuade the soul to rest wholly upon God, and set her delight in
him. 2 The means whereby God becomes the souls whole contentment. 3 the
marks and rules of trial, whereby she may know she is not deceived in her
choice.

The persuading motives are four. The first is, the consideration of the
infinite love of God declared and revealed unto us. For God so loved the world,
that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him, should
not perish, but have everlasting life, Ioh. 3.16. The gradation makes this
affection singular Eia fratres, Deus voluit esse filius hominis, homines esse
voluit filios deit ipse descendit propter nos, nos ascendimus propter ipsum:
and haec spes est cateris, quod propterea ille descendit, and ascendit, ut in
illo, and cum illo unum essent, quiper illum ^scensuri essent. S. Aug. tract.

Idcirco Deus mundum dilexit amore inenarrabili and inaestimabili: mundum
inquam, qui totus in malo jacet. 1. Joh. 5.19. ne quis de mundo, aut in mundo
de Dei desperare ausit gratia; idcirco filium Dei non adoptivum, sed suum, sed
unigemtum dedit pro omnibus, ut omnibus salus offerretur, ideo non misit

S. Hilar. lib. 6. de trinit.


. The all-sufficient God, loved where he found cause of hatred, the world an
enemy, no friend, he so loved that he gave, his gift was a Son, his own
Son, not one adopted, his only begotten Son, not one of many, not for
himself, but to purchase thee eternal life. To requite which love what
recompense does the Lord require at thy hands but thy love to him in heaven,
and thy affection on earth? What soul can be so steely as not embrace and
kiss that hand, which has care for nothing in heaven but thy salvation, and
for nothing on earth, but thy comfort, content, and satisfaction Sic Deum
loquentem inducit Euthimius in loc. Margaritum quippe est sermo Dei, and ex
omni part forari potest. S. Hieron. ep. 22.
. And when the Son of God ascended, he had so perfected our Redemption, that
there was nothing left for him to do more, either in heaven or earth: nor for
us, but to welcome his mercy, and congratulate his victory with faith,
reciprocal love, and obedience Arnob. in loc. Si affixus serpens ligno, filijs

. The Sun lends the light by day, the Moon her borrowed beams by night, the
earth bears the fruit, the sea brings the fish, the heavens drop her honey

according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving
kindnesses: Esaias 63.7.

The second is, the meditation as well of thy misery, as of the necessity to be
at one with God: without whose favor, were thy bones full of marrow, thy
barnes of wheat, thy banqueting house of mirth, thy bed of rest, thy house of
children, thy name of honor, yet thy condition is fearful, and more
despicable then the silly being of the bruit beast Crucior in haec flamma. Luc.

monentur, quia cum dubitatione solent cogitare iram dei, quibus not aperte

, are one with the father, have the spirit for their pledge of mercy, and put
their trust in him. Psalm. 2.12. Thy misery calls upon thee, to make God thy
felicity, the mercy of God invites thee, with proffer of balm, to heal thy
infirmity, and the consistory of heaven sits to eye and observe, the bent of
thy affections Deus ipse omnium rector and Dominus cum omni angelorum militia

expectantium dignitate metire. S. Hieron. tom. 9. ep. 1.
, and to crown thy happy choice, and love of him who loved us first.

Nor is the third consideration less forcible, drawn from the survey of Gods
ineffable excellency, and all sufficiency to relieve us in all conditions,
and yield the soul in every estate a plenary contentment. The round world can
never fill man's triangular heart with solid contentation Quando enim veluit
habere gaudia de se, invenit planctum in se: totum gaudium nostrum Deus est;
qui vult securus gaudere, inillo gaudeat qui non potest perire. Aut argentum
perit aut tu, and nemoscit quid prius, verum illud constat, quia utrumque
peri^urum est, quid prius incertum est. Nam nec homo hic potest manner semper,
sic aurum, sic vestis, sic domus, sic pecunia, sic lata praedia, sic lux ista.
Noli ergo velle gaudere in istis, sed gaude in illa luce quae non habet
occasum, quam non praecedit hesternus dies, nec sequitur crastinus. S. Aug. in
Psalm. 84. tom. 8.
: as one corner fills, another empties it self of its former delight, but the
heir of heaven is like the air which fills all things it finds empty,
replenisheth every heart, emptied of the love of the world, and opened to
welcome the king of glory. In want, his clemency is wealth, in woe thy weal,
in sorrow consolation Osiander. in loc.
, in hunger he is meat; in thirst, drink; in sickness, physic; in all
things all, so that he wants nothing with God, who delights in nothing but God:
but he who enjoyes not the all-sufficient God, what helper sufficient can he
find in his labors? what sufficient defense in dangers? what counsel in his
doubts? what comforter in his sorrows? what refuge sufficient in his
temptations to Quem habent in laboribus adjutorem? Sclinepius in loc. verum
gaudium non est doterra, sed de coelo. Et revera illud verum and solum est
gaudium, quod non de creatura, sed de creatore concipitur, and quod cum
possederis nemo tollat a te. Cui comparata omnis aliunde jocunditas, moeror
est, omnis suavitas dolor^ est, omne dulce amarum est, omne decorum foedum,
omne denique quod cunque delectare possit aliud molestum. S. Bern. ep: 114.
yield him shelter, and deliverance? enquire of the creatures where contentment
dwells; and where the soul may lodge her wearied limbs in some bed of rest?
They will all answer with joint consent, repose is not in us. They send every
pilgrim, every passenger unto the Lord. The sea says, I am but the Lords great
fish pond to furnish thy table on fasting days; the earth says, I am his
footestoole, or at most the garden of God Amos 9.6.
watered to yield thee a posie of flowers; the winds say, we are the breath of
his nostrils, the clouds say, we are his chariots; the fire says, I am his
furnace to perfect and purge his metals; the stars, we are his torchlight;
the heaven says, I am his throne; the angels say, we are his messengers, the
creatures say, they are but provision for the men of Gods household; so that,
nor any thing in heaven, nor earth, dare assume to it self the Lords
prerogative, Pulchrum coelum, pulchra terra, sed pulchrior qui fecit illa. S.

sufficiency to settle and content the soul of man Modica, transitoria,
terrena sunt quae despicis; maxima, aeterna, coelestia sunt quae appetis; plus
dicam, and verum dicam. Tenebras deseris, and lucem ingrederis; de profundo

de morte denique transis ad vitam. S. Ber. ep. 114.
: which leaving the creature to embrace the Creator, rises again from death
to life. This all-sufficiencie of God, as it stands in relation to the soul of
man, is couched in that emphaticall asseveration. Thou art the strength of my
heart, and my Portion for ever Psalm. 73.26. Etenim hareditas mea praclara est,
non omnibus, sed videntibus, in quibus quia ego sum, mihi est. S. Aug. in Psalm.
16.5.
: God is the portion of his Saints five ways.

1 As children receive portions by their parents free love, and great
liberality, not their proper merit: so the interest they have in the Lord,
springs not from their desert, but his free grace and mercy in Jesus Christ
Quid dicturi sumus ei qui primo gratis nos facit? Merita nostra fecisse ut
nobis illa salus perpetua mitteretur a Domino? Absit. Si merita nostra aliquid
facerent, ad damnationem nostram veniret. Non venit ille ad inspectionem
meritorum, sed ad remissionem peccatorum. Non fuisti, and factus et, quid Deo
dedisti? Malus fuisti, and liberatus es; quid Deo dedesti? quid non ab eo
gratis accepisti? merito igitur and gratia nominatur; quia gratis datur.
Exigitur ergo ^^te, ut and tu gratis cum col^^, non quia dat temporalia, sed
quia praestat aeterna. S. Aug. in Psalm. 43.
: he found out Adam in paradise, Abraham in the wilderness, the child cast out
in her blood, and the hopeless Paralyticke at the poole of Bethesda, before
he found him in Bethel, the house of God John 5.14.
.

2 As the heir has the best propriety, and title unto his inheritance, so
the Saints the most right to Christ; God is their portion: and they are Gods
portion: for the Lords portion is his people: Jacob is the lot of his
inheritance. Deuteronomy. 32.9. My chief treasure: Exodus 19.5. though all the earth
be mine. He says unto the wicked Lo-ammi, for ye are not my People, and I
will not be your God, Hos. 1.9. 3 In respect of fertility and fruitfulness:
For as he gave the Hebrews store of all things Deuteronomy. 8.7. and 11.10.
, as well for Charity, their honor and dignity, delicacie, and conveniencie,
as for necessity; houses to dwell in, wine to glad the heart, oil to cheer
and clear the countenance, milk to nourish them, honey to delight them, wells
to wash in, valleys for Corn, mountains for brass, iron, and stone: So God
is a Rich and large portion unto every believing Soul which enjoyes him. And
as a man's Portion finds his house and person necessaries; even so the Lord
maintains his, and procures them all things, that they want nothing that is
good. The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my Cup thou
maintainest my lot. Psalm. 16.5, 6. The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want,
thou anointest my head with oil, and my Cup Et p^culum tuum, oblivionem
praestans priorum vanarum delectationum, quam praeclarum est, S. Aug. in Psalm.

runs over. Psalm. 23.1.5. Nihil deest timentibus eum, Multi propterea volunt
timere Deum ne famem patiantur, dicitur illis, nolite fraudem facere; and
dicunt, unde me posco? non potest ars sine impostura esse, non potest negotium
esse sine fraud, sed fraudem punit Deus; ti^e Deum, si timuero Deum non habebo
unde vivam. Nihil decrit timentibus Deum. Copiam promittit trepido and
dubitanti, ne si forte timuerit Dominum deserant illam superstua, Poscebat te
dominus contemnentem se, and deseret te timentem se* S. Aug. in Psalm. 34.10.
vid. loc.
.

4. In regard of his Al-sufficiencie; for as it was Iudahs Blessing, that his
hands should be sufficient for him, Deuteronomy. 33.7. So it is the blessing of Gods
right hand, upon all those who lift up both their hands unto his testimonies
Psalm. 119.48. Pulcherrimus ordo, ut prmo meditemur, and eorum qua diligimus,
praeceptorum, sit nobis assueta meditatio. Deinde levavi 'manus. Nam sicut
meditationi verborum finis memoria est, ut quae meditamur verba teneamus: sic
meditationis praeceptorum coelestium intentio vel finis est operatio. S. Ambr.
in loc. Nihil prodest facienda didicisse, and non sacere. S. Hieron. Tom. 9.
ep. 1.
, that the hands of God shall be sufficient for them, in all conditions to
provide all Comforts, and to help them from their Enemies, his hands can
enlarge a scantie portion unto a competencie, unto a sufficiency, and make him
that has nothing, to possess all things, 2. Cor. 6.10.

Lastly, the Inheritance is the heirs Contentation and whole delight. Naboth
would not part with his fathers inheritance at any rate 1 Kings 21.3.
, and the Saints find such a sweetness in their God, as nothing can draw them
to an exchange, admit a sale; what is the price? either Heaven, or Earth apart,
or the whole world together, with all the pomp and glory of it, as was once
proffered by a cosening Merchant Mat. 4.9. Quadruplex Gigantis certamen primum
in coeli: alterum in paradiso terrestri: tertium in deserto: quartum in mundo.
primum cum angelis initum; secundum cum Evah and Adam; tertium cum Christo;
quartum cum omnibus hominibus. In primo victus e coelo praecipitatus, in altero
vicit, hominemque e coelo praecipitavit; in tertio victus abscessit, in quarto
and vincit, and vincitur. S. Basil Hom. 21. ut Pelargus in loc.
: but these will not carry it, they prize him at a higher rate: whom have I in
heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth, that I desire besides thee?

The fourth and last motive to make the Lord the whole joy and delight of our
Souls, is the happy knowledge of the world of comfort and inward peace
arising thence unto us in life and death. There can no storm arise, but this
Harbor will refresh thee, no danger appear, but the covert of his wings will
shadow thee Erat uno, eodemque tempore, and cum Apostolis quadraginta diebus,
and cum Angelis, and in Patre, and in extremis maris finibus erat, in omnibus
locis versabatur, cum Thoma in India, cum Petro Romae, cum Paulo in Jllyrico,
cum Tito in Creta, cum Andrea in Achaia, cum singulis Apostolis and Apostolicis
viris in singulis cunctisque regionibus. S. Hieron. Ep. 148.
, no misery assault thee, but this potent and merciful hand will rescue thee:
None of his members suffers, but his eye observes them, his heart pities them

Sancta pericula semper suspicit and poenas alieno in corpore sentit. Sedulius.

his blessing follows them, his Consolations crown them Sed fert Magnanimum,

loc.
. So long as Christ is the Captain, let no Soldier of his faint or fear.
Though the Sea rage, the Earth tremble, the yles shake, the mountains leap
into the Ocean, the Inhabitants of the world be tumultuous, the mighty Monarkes
menace; yea, though thunder and lightening threaten us from above, and death
dart us through, till his quiver be empty, and Hell open her mouth to swallow
us alive or dead, and Satan encampe against us with his iron chariots, yet the
Lord thy God reigns, he is clothed with majesty Decorem induit amicis,
fortitudinem inimicis -- fortibus gravis est, at infirmis levis est,
suspendantur fluctus quantum volunt, fiemat mare quantum vult; mirabiles quidem
suspensurae maris, mirabiles minae, mirabiles persecutiones -- Turbabatur mare,
fluctuabat navicula. Navicula ecclesia est, mare saeculum est; venit dominus,
ambulavit super mare, and pressit fluctus, quomodo ambulavit dominus super
mare? super capita justorum fluctuum, magnorum spumantium. S. Aug. in loc.
and strength; the Lord on high is mightier, then the noise of many waters: yea
then the mighty waves of the Sea, Psalm. 93.1.4. yea, then the potentates on
earth; yea, then the powers of hell, Contrivisti capita draconum, Draconum
capita daemoniorum superbias, a quibus gentes possidebantur: contrivisti super
aquam; quia eos quos possidebant, tu per baptismum liberasti: Cujus Draconis?
intelligimus Dracones, omnia Daemonia sub diabolo militantia: quem ergo
singularem draconem cujus caput contitum est, nisi ipsum diabolum intelligere
debemus. S. Aug. in Psalm. 74.13.
to save and comfort every soul that depends on him. For, as the waters of the
deluge prevailed increased, and covered the Mountains; the Arc of Noah
mounted so much the more upon the surges: semblably, the more the Sea of
affliction swells, the more the Lord makes his consolations to abound, and
raises the sanctified affections toward the enjoyment of heaven.

The second considerable, is the means, whereby the Lord becomes the Souls
whole contentment; which are five.

First, the constant and conscionable Hearing, reading, and meditation of the
sacred Word of God Solomon Gesnerus in loc.
, whereby (his backe-parts and admirable beauty, his mercy Suavis est dominus,
quoniam in saeculum miserecordia ejus. Psalm. 107.1. Si gustastis, confitemini,
non potest autem confiteri, qui gustare noluit. Si gustastis aviditate,
confessione eructate. S. August. in loc.
, goodness, love and kindness, with all other his incomparable excellencies
being laid open to the view Psalm. 136. per totum. Misericordia ejus in aternum.
Quod enim justi ex iniquis erimus, sani ex infirmis, vivi ex mortuis, and
immortales ex mortalibus, beati ex miseris, misericordia ejus est; hoc autem
quod ita erimus, in aeternum erit, ergo in aeternum misericordia ejus. S. Aug:
in loc.
) the Soul becomes so enamoured Deum diligere nullus modus, nulla mensura est,
nisi haec sola, ut ei totum exhibeas, quantum habes. idem eod. Modus diligendi
deum, est sine modo diligere. Si quis unquam est, qui fideli hoc amore verbi
dei arsit aliquaendo, qui electi jaculi ejus dulce vulnus plagamque accipit,
qui scientiae ejus amabili confixus est telo; divinis eum desiderijs
nocturnisque suspiret, aliud quid loqui non possit, audire aliud nolit,
cogitare aliud nesciat, desiderare praeter ipsum, aut cupere aliud vel sperare
non lib^at, and dicat vulneratae charitatis ego sum. S. Hier. ib.
of him, that she is sick of love, and needs Flaggons of wine to give her
comfort Cant. 2.5. ad hanc domum vini, Ecclesia, vel anima vnaquaeque desiderat
intrare; and dogmatibus sapientia mysterijque scientia, epularum velut
suavitate, and vini latitia perfrui. S. Hier. Hom. 3. in loc.
. None are out of love with God, but such as know him not, aliens from the
Commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the Covenants of promise Ephesians. 2.12.
. For, as the Queen of Sheba, when she had seen Salomons wisdom, and the
house that he had built, and the meat of his table, the sitting of his
Servants, the attendants of his Ministers, and their apparel, and his
Cup-bearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the Lord,
fell into admiration, insomuch as for joy, love and delightful content, there
was no more spirit in her 1. Kin. 10.4.5. Nescio autem si ita ineptam putemus
fuisse reginam, quae ob hoc venerat a finibus terrae ut miretur cibos; Sed mihi
videtur miratam esse cibos doctrinae ejus, and vinum dogmatum, quae ab co per
divinam sapienti^m praedicabantur. S. Hieron. Homil. 1. in Cant. Canticorum.
Nec regni ejus sublimitate sed mentis luce commota est. S. Aug. Tom. 10. de
tempore Ser. 35.
, so when in the Chrystall-glasse of the Word, we see our own misery, and at
the same instant find Gods left hand under our head, and his right hand
embracing, and supporting us Cant. 2.6. Descriptio est quidem amatorij dramatis

sinistra vero ejus divitiae and gloria. Pro. 3.16. -- illa pars verbi dei, quae

; The promise of mercy and pardon in Gods right hand, Heaven in his left,
Christ Jesus courting his fathers subjects (but with better affection) then
once Absolon courted David's,) the Spirit of Christ Clothing us with purity,
Angels triumphing at our Reconciliation, Mansions and Crowns prepared for us,
our Souls are wounded with one of his eyes Cant. 5 9.
, and so far elevated with unspeakable delights that they choose God before
all, and despise whatsoever stands in Competition with Christ. The more the
heart dives into the clear Fountains of the Word, the more it is enflamed, and
thirsts after Christ, the water of life. The more acquaintance thou have with
the Word of God, the more thou will daily hunger after acquaintance with God
himself Job. 22.21.
, and long to taste how sweet he is above all Creatures in Heaven and Earth.

2. The second means, (if examples can persuade) is the pattern of the
Saints, who like innocent Doves take Mat. 10.16.
their flight from the highest pinnacle of worldly prosperity, unto the windows
of Heaven, as to their repose and Nests Esaias 60.8.
. Those who have conquered enemies, gotten riches Jlle namque cum adhuc esset
in carne Zachaeum divitem in regnum coelorum misit, and multos postea divites
impertito Spiritu Sanctos fecit hujus saeculi contemptores, and sinita
divitiarum cupiditate ditiores. St. August. Tom. 2. Epist. 121. cap. 1. Dabo
illis solatium verum, pacem super pacem. Jer. 14.13. sine quo solatio

, won renown, obtained Crowns, governed Kingdoms, have in the end unladen
their vessels, and divested themselves of all to have communion and fellowship
with God. Wealthy Zachaeus Luke 19.8.
gave half his goods to the poor, as a free donation to welcome Christ, and
made a fourefold restitution, to give satisfaction where his finger had
searched, or his tongue lashed, by oppression or false accusation. Rich Abraham
with contempt of his Coin, purchased a place of rest Genesis 23.16. St. Hieron.
Tom. 9. Ep. 3.
, where he buried his dead, in assured hope of resurrection to an
incorruptible Crown. Job was not dismayed with loss of all Fit pauper ex

naturam saeculi respuenter, and in valle lachrymarum turrim occupat gloriarum.
S. Hieron. Tom. 9. Ep. 20.
, but made his Patience proclaim that his joys and chief contentments were
above upon that God, who has power to give and take at his pleasure, who is
better then all. Saint Paul, that vessel of Election, whose blindness gave
sight to the whole world Pauli caecitas, totius orbis illuminatio effecta est.
S. Chrysostom. Tom. 4. Hom. 4. Virtutem ipsam pro mercede pensavit, multo magis

, after once the scales fell from his eyes, sought nothing, loved nothing, knew
nothing, cared for nothing, desired to know nothing, embrace nothing but Jesus
Christ, and him crucified 1. Cor. 2.2.
. The Apostle Peter, a son of Abraham, and equal with Abraham in his choice,
leaves all for Christ Abraham nescio an major, certe quod sentio, non sicundus.
S. H^eron. in Tom. 9. Ep. 20.

Illi generatio larga promittitur, huic generatio pascenda committitur: illi

. And though he was the prime Speaker, yet he was not the sole Actor in that
Triumph, he was the Standard Bearer of the Gospel Augustum caput Petrus

, and the rest of the Apostles were his Fellow Soldiers. Behold, we have
forsaken all and followed thee. Mat. 19.27. That all was no great possessions,
yet to forsake their all was great devotion, and gave sufficient testimony of
their heavenly affections Quae sunt ista omnia apud eum, qui praeter
instrumentum artis piscatoris nihil habebat. S. Aug. Tom. 9. Ep: 20.
. His hook was as much to him, as a house to some others; his Fishing poole,
as a Park; his boat, as their barnes; his lines, as their land; his wyre, as
their woods: yet whatsoever it was they left, it was dear unto them, and is
numbered among things which are most dear. Whosoever has forsaken houses,
Brethren, Sisters, Fathers, Mothers, Wife, Children or Lands. What so dear as
these? yet Christ to them was dearer, and dearest of all Reddidit Zacheus
quadruplum quod rapuerat; divisitque pauperibus medietatem substantiae suae,
quae remanserat: suscepit Christum hospitem; salus facta est domui ejus.
Apostoli autem, quantum ad divitias, nihil, quantum ad voluntatem, totum mundum
pariter reliquerunt. Si offeramus Christo opes cum anima nostra, libenter
suscipiet, si autem quae foris sunt Deo, quae intus sunt Diabolo demus, non est
aequa partitio. S. Hier. Tom. 8. Ep. 26.
, for whose names sake, they desired not to have any name among these, nor yet
once to name them, in assurance to have their names written in the book of
life.

3. As the strong man which keeps Christ out of the heart, is self-love: So
the key that opens the everlasting gates Psalm. 24.7. Elevamini aditus aeternae
vitae, renuntiationis saeculo and conversionis ad deum. -- Et elevamini portae
aeternae justitiae, charitatis, and castitatis: per quas anima diligit unum

of the Soul to receive the King of glory in, is Mortification and
self-denial; take away the blind and lame corruptions harbored in the
fortresses of our hearts 2. Sam. 5.6.
, then shall our David reign over us. But as the Fort of Sion was not won
without some danger, no more can this Conquest over a man's self be obtained
without some difficulty Anne est aliquid tam durum, tam ferreum, quam repugnare

. That a man should deny his Parents, forget his friends, as Pharohs Butler,
Joseph; deny his Master, as Peter his Lord; deny the truth, as Gehasi; his
Journey is not more easy then common and customary: but to deny a Man's self,
is an Herculean labor, yea, which is more, a Christians hard task Tum quia
durum est praesentia sibi abdicare dum vivit: and futura sperare post vitam. S.
Hieron. eodem. Durum est vias domini custodire; in quibus non experimentis, sed
detrimentis potentiae desudatur, nec quaeritur ut supra nos, quod amat universa
mortalitas, sed ut sub nos vita dicatur, ne amplius nos existimando quam sumus:
incipiamus nec id obtinere quod sumus: cum per hoc ipsum, si velimus despicere
quod sumus, mereamur in melius esse quam sumus. Hieron. ibid.
, through which he can never wade, unless Vlysses-like he tie himself to the
maine-Mast of Gods Word. Yet what is more equal, then for thy Soul to deny her
self and all terrestrials, to embrace her naked Savior, seeing the Savior of
the world humbled himself, below men, yea, below birds and beasts for thy
Salvation. The Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests: but the
son of man has not where to lay his head, Mat. 8.20. Quid me propter
divitias, and saeculi lucra cupis sequi; cum tanta sim paupertatis, ut ne
hospitiolum quidem hababeam, nec meo utar lecto. S. Hier. (...). non ad sonum
verborum, sed ad sensum interrogantis, accommodata est responsie. S. Chrysostom.

, if a poor man will not follow Christ, because he is very poor, how hardly
will a rich man become poor to become the Disciple of Christ? What means the
visitation of his Temple, his ejection of all them that sold and bought
therein, the overthrow of the tables of the money changers, and the seats of
them that sold Doves Mat. 21.12. Nescitis. quod opertet me in paternis meis
esse, scilicet in Templo, non in saculo, in sacrificiorum mysterio, non in
malignantium concilio: in paternis utique spiritualibus, nam patrem in
carnalibus non habebat. S. Hieron. Tom. 9. Ep. 20.
: but our instruction to cast the world and the things of the world out of our
hearts, and to prepare and preserve them as holy temples, dedicated to the
Lord, reserved for his blessed inhabitation. And as the Levites by the command
of Moses put every man his sword by his side, went in and out from gate to gate
through the Camp, and slew every man his brother, and every man his companion,
and every man his neighbor Exodus 32.27. Quia melius est paucorum supplicio
universos eximi, quam in omnes vindicari. S. Ambr.
: So every Christian must with the Sword of the word and Spirit murder, and
cut the throat of every one of his corruptions, how near, or dear soever they
seem unto him. Outward profession Non in carne palam, sed in occulto cordis
Jadaei esse debemus, non litera sed spiritu. S. Hieron. Tom. 9. Ep. 20.
of religion is not sufficient to Salvation, without this inward circumcision.
Christ healed the Lepers, and the Sick of several infirmities, yet commanded
them silence; he did things worthy of praise in private, yet would not be
praised in public Mira ratio, non vult praedicari, quod gaudet intelligi,
agnosci amat, and odit ostendi; si: mysterium obtectae circumcisionis exercens.
Nam mavult se inventum esse, quam proditum, ut virtus sua illum, non favor

; such must his members be, better then they appear to be, the inside of
mortification be every whit as good or better then the outside of profession.
Abraham's circumcision of the foreskin of his flesh Abraham designat in carne,

fidei. ibid. Genesis 17.24.
, was an outward manifestation of inward amputation of his inbred Corruptions
that cleaved so fast unto him, Heb. 12.1. He that offered up his Son a
lively Sacrifice unto God Lucratur orbitatem dum parricidium meditatur: and cum
unico non parcit in terris stellas pro filijs annumerare jubetur in coelis.
Carnalisque despector naturae, in natura siderum collocatur, and humani
contemptor seminis pater vocatur astrorum. Genesis 22.10. ibid.
, teaches us to Crucify our Sins, to enjoy the favor of God. That Great
Baptist, in making the wilderness his pulpit, teaches as well by conversation
Multa a prophetis denunciata populo, ab ipsis prophetis sunt primum effecta.
Vadit nudus Propheta, and in se quod alij vaticinabatur, oflendit, videt
vulgus, non audit, and in Esaiae corpore, quae sibi erant ventura, cognoscit;

, as Doctrine, all his Auditors that desire to embrace Christ, to fly from the
vanities of this world, by leaving the great Cities, the Theaters of
wickedness. He preached not in the Temples, not in the streets, in the Cities,
in the highways, where he should have met with multitudes, but in the
wilderness, to call, and cry them out of Jerusalem, invite out from their
pleasures and profits to repent of their sins, and be washed from their
iniquities. And as the wise men forsook Herod's favor, and opened and forsook
their own treasures to present the Heir of the world Mat. 2.11. Magi suis se
affectibus circumcidere, cum thesa^ris suis, id est, secr^tis mentium
patefactis, animorum motus mactavere pro munere, eosque morbos, per quos
aliquid aut cupimus, aut metuimus aut dolemus, velut ante pietatis aram and
miserecordiae altar foderunt: ut uelin auro avaritia, vel in Thure,
idololatria: vel in Myrrha fieret domino subjecta mortalitas. S. Hieron. loc.
cit.
; so to become a present acceptable to the Lord, we must renounce our selves,
and whatsoever wherein flesh and blood treasures up the most contentment.

This is a hard saying (says flesh and blood) to draw blood from the very
heart; True! but the love of Christ will make that facile to the Spirit which
is fierce and fearful to the flesh Cultello itaque petrino corporis nostri
circumcidenda est natura. Petra autem Christus est, cujus cultellus amor est,
quo crescente in nobis, saeculidesideria decrescent, quem qui amaverit, dicit
patri, non novi te, nec dicet iam, cuius circumcisa est natura, patrem, praeter
cum qui est in coelis se habere. Hieron. eod.
. And how much better is it to lanch the impostumated flesh, open a vein to
take away corrupted blood, and cut off a member Gangreen'd to go to heaven,
then to die remediless, and eternally be tormented Mat. 5.29.
. Nor is the Service of Christ so burdensome to a Son, as the service of Sin
is heavy and grievous to the Sinner: the transgressor has more torture and
vexation Et qui voluptates corporis virtutum amore contempsimus, rursum amore
vitiorum tormenta suscipimus: atque ita malis nostris cedimus, ut ea nec
putemus posse deponi. Res difficiles, and laboris plenas securus aggredior, and
faciliora non posse fieri credo. Libenter fugio quod delectat, and nolo vitaere
quod cruciat. S. Hieron. Tom. 9. Ep. 1.
in a day, whiles he moyles in Satan's Brick-kills, then the Saint all the
days of his life, in the Service of his God, and one day in Gods Court yields
him more sound joy and delight, then a thousand years afford unto the worker
of iniquity. And if the very shadow of Mortification, receives a temporary
recompense Multi huius virtutis umbram, veritatem eius sequuntur pauci,
perfacile est enim aliquam vestem habere conte^ptam, salutare submissius, manus
and genua deosculari, inclinato in terram capite, oculisque deiectis

clamare: and si vel levi sermon offensus sit, continua attollere supercilium,
levare cervicem, and delicatum illum oris Sermonem, and sonum insano repent
clamore mutare. St. Hieron. Tom. 9. Ep. 1.
, how great shall the reward of true selfe-denyall be? The excellency and
greatness of the wages, will fully reward the difficulty of the work;
remember, that he who loves Father or mother more then Christ, is not worthy
of Christ, and he that loves Son or daughter more then him, is not worthy
of him. Mat. 10.37.

Seeing God requires nothing at thy hands save thy Coat of corruption, let him
have thy cloak of hypocrisy also Mat. 5.40.
; seeing the Law requires thy obedience for a mile, let the bond of love
constrain thee to go with him twain: Leave all thy self for his love, who
gave himself for thee Remittite pallium, tunicam detrabenti. Pecunia little cum
ipsis sit in interitum, qui Christo pecuniam praetulerunt. Exeuntes semel de
Sodom, cuncta relinquamus incendijs. S. Hieron. ibid. Ep. 3.
, and with Levi observe his Word, keep his Covenant, know not thy own
children, nor acknowledge thy brethren, say to thy Father and mother I have not

the Lord. All this is come upon us: yet have we not forgotten thee, neither
have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. Psalm. 44.17, 18, 19.

The fifth and last means is fervent prayer unto God. This is the Catholic
medicine for all maladies, the means sanctified by the Lord, to obtain all
blessings of the Lord, himself Quotidie lachrymae, quotidie gemitus, cum in
Eremo constitutus essem: ille igitur ego qui ob gebennae metum, tali me carcere
ipse damnaveram, scorpionum tantum socius and ferarum saepe choris intereram
puellarum. Pallebant ora ieiunijs, and men's desiderijs aestuabat in frigido
corpore, and ante hominem sua iam carne praemortuum, sola libidinum incendia
bulliebant, itaque omni auxilio destitutus, ad Jesu iacebam pedes, rigabam
lachrimis, crine tergebam and repugnantem carnem hebdomadarum in edia
subingabam. St. Hieron. Tom. 1. Ep. 22.
. He that becomes a suter unto the Almighty, that the Scepter of Christ may
rule in his heart, and that his soul may be even ravished and filled with the
love of God in and above all, shall speed, if so be his supplication be
faithful, humble, and fervent. He never replies with, It is not mine to give
Math. 20.22, 23. Non est meum dare vobis; i. e. sic superbe petentibus,
insolenter, elate de carnis tumore, non spiritus lenitate. Nam ego qui nunc
resisto vobis, humilibus dare gratiam consuevi. St. Hieron. Tom. 9. Ep. 20.
: unless we ask we know not what, or otherwise then we ought. Three graces
must ever attend our prayers to make them prevalent: faith wings them and gives
them life, hope pitcheth them at heaven's gate, and charity presents them at
the throne of grace In ipsa ergo fide, and spe, and charitate continuato
desiderio semper oramus. S. Aug. Tom. 2. ep. 121. Probae. cap. 8.
. It is not many words Neque enim ut nonnulli putant, hoc est orare in
multiloquio, si diutius oretur, aliud est sermo multus, aliud di^turnus
affectus. ibid. cap. 10.
, nor eloquent phrases that do prevail, but deep sighs Romans 8.26. Nam
pierumque hoc negotium plus gemitibus, quam sermonibus agitatur, plus fletu
quam affatu. idem.
, a broken heart, great groans, strong faith, a lively hope, and love unfeigned
that speed. These may find some resemblance in that of the Evangelist; If a
son shall ask bread of any of you, that is a father, will he give him a
stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? or if he
shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? Luke 11.11. faith is as the
fish, hope as the egg, love as the bread Fides significetur in pisce, vel
propter aquam baptismi, vel quod in hujus seeculi fluctibus integra est, spes
in ovo, quia vita pulli nondu^ est, sed futura est, nec jam videtis, sed adhuc
speratur. Charitas in pane, major enim herum charitas, and in cibis utique
vincit caetera panis utilitas. Cui contrarius est ille serpens, qui ut non
crederetur deo, venenosa fraud persuasit? Cui contrarius est Scorpius, quiex
ea part cavendus est, qua venenatam and aculeatam caudam retrorsum habet, sed
ei quisperat vitam aeternam, noxium est respicere. Cui contrarius est lapis,
quoniam dura corda respuunt charitatem S. Aug. ibid.
; as the child comes unto the father for these, so must we approach to our
heavenly father with these. The old serpent persuades us to doubt of Gods love,
but faith broacheth our prayers without wavering, and keeps them and us, as
the fresh fish in the salt waters, untainted in this evil and wicked world.
Hope makes us forget what is behind, and press forward toward the promises,
and not turn tale with the Scorpion, and when we are out of Sodom look
back, pray and distrust. The chicke of blessing, in the egg of mercy, will in
due time be hatched, if we wait with patience. And though decayed love chils
and hardens our confidence, and make it like a stone; yet true love of God,
heartens our requests, and feeds our hopes, as the body is nourished with the
purest bread Qui petit accipiet ei. Lucae. 11.9. Quare hoc facit dominus qui
novit quid necessarium, antequam petamus? Deus noster non voluntatem nostram
sibi velit innotescere, quam non potest ignorare, sed exerceri in orationibus
desiderium nostrum, quo possimus capere quod praeparat dare. S. Aug. ibid. cap.
8.
. To these add continuance in prayer, pray without intermission 1 Thessal.
5.17. De ipso domino scriptum est, quod pernoctaverit in orando and quod
prolixius oraverit. Absit ab oratione multa locutio, sed non desit multa
precatio, si fervens perseverat intentio: Nam multum loqui, est in orando rem
necessariam superfluis agere verbis: multum autem precari est ad cum quem
precamur, diuturna and pia cordis excitatione pulsare. S. Aug. eod.
. We have Christ for our leader, who spent whole hours and nights in prayer to
his father for us: that when we pray to the father in his name, his
intercession may obraine our consolation. And we have Christ's words, a most
perfect pattern of prayer Tam late patet, ut homo Christianus in qualibet
tribulatione constitutus, in hoc gemitus edat, in hoc lacrymas fundat, hinc
exordiatur, in hoc immoretur, ad hoc terminet orationem. Nam quamlibet alia
verba dicamus, quae offictus orantis, vel praecedendo format, ut clareat, vel
consequendo attendit ut crescat, nihil aliud dicimus, quam quod in ista
dominica oratione positum est, si recte and congruenter oramus S. Aug. loc.
citat. Habes, quantum arbitror, non solum qualis ores, verum etiam quid ores:
non me docente, sed illo qui omnes docere dignatus est. idem. cap. 13.
to lead us: which whiles we follow we cannot pray amiss: run over and
read the devout prayers of all the Saints, of Moses, and Myriam, Deborah, and
David, they are all in this Compendiary Et si per omnia precationum sanctarum
verba discurras, quantum existimo, nihil invenies quod non ista dominica
contineat and concludat oration. idem cap. 12.
: Enlarge thy heart from East to West, from North to South, from earth to
heaven: ask of him, whose promise was once to give whatsoever could be
desired: were thy desires unlimited, they are here both limited and
comprehended: we may use with this some other expression Vnde liberum est
alijs atque alijs verbia, eadem tamen in orando dicere. Sed non debet esse
liberum alia dicere. ibid.
of our wants, and devotion, but besides what is here included, we must not
dare to present God with any new petition: what request soever, though glazed
with show of piety is dissonant and contrary to this pattern is impiety and
blasphemy Quisquis antem id dicit quod ad istam Evangelicam precem pertinere
non possit, etiamsi non illicite orat, carnaliter orat, quod nescio quemadmodum
non dicatur illicite, quandoquidem spiritu renatos non nisi spiritualiter decet
orare. idem ibid. cap. 12.
. But he that comes unto God, in Christ's word, in Christ's way, in Christ's
mediation, shall never return empty, nor spread out his hands in vain. If
importunity will raise the baker at midnight, out of his dead sleep to serve
his neighbor bread: what will importunity effect at the hands of our maker Si
enim non dat ad horam, exerce quarentem, non contemnit petentem. Eusebius. Emissen:
, who never slumbers nor sleeps: Luke 11.8. If ye then being evil, know how
to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly
father, give the holy spirit to them that ask him Petite ergo animo, quaerite

The third and last branch of the exhortation is the rule of trial, whether
the soul be deceived in her choice: vices march under the mask and banner of
virtue Summa tibi scientia sit, notitia summa, vitia, virtutesque distinguere,

similitudine, ut discerni omnino vix possint. Quam multi enim superbiam

. Keep that which is good, is great profit. The soul who has preferred the
Lord to all the world, and makes him her chief and whole delight, is known by
four inseparable badges.

1 He casts himself, and care wholly on Gods mercy, favor and truth, for the
things of this life, and a better. He knows the child's hand on earth, can
effect nothing, without the fathers hand in heaven Mat. 6.27. Sicut corpori ne
exiguum quidem augmentum potes adjicere curando, sed absque tua sollicitudine
illius incrementum consequeris, ita te oportet etiam alimoniam congregare sine

, his pains without Gods providence, his back and belly can nor fat, nor fill
without his blessing, that his welfare depends on Gods good will: whereupon
he binds himself to stand and fall to Gods arbitration, and recommends
whatsoever he dare call his in heaven and earth into the hands of the Lord. He
uses the necessary lawful means, but his mind, and meaning is not to rely
upon them Mat. 6.27. Nolite cogitare in crastinum. Non vos istis verbis cogit,

faster then God: whence it comes to pass, his expectation fails, and his

approbation: they stand not upon the way leading to their ends, be it good or
bad. So they may be brought by it unto their prefixed and proposed ends Illi a

to love one another, A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one
another, as I have loved you, that ye also love one another: John 13.34. To
love one another is common: but to love one another, as Christ loved us, is
rare but mavelous. The bond of love among men is natural Diligunt invicem
mariti and uxores, parents and filij, and quaecunque alia inter se homines
necessitudo humana devinxerit: ut taceamus de dilectione culpabili, atque
damnabili, qua diligunt invicem adulteri and adultera, scortatatores and
meretrices, and quoscunque alios non humana necessitudo, sed humanae vitae
noxia turpitudo conjungit. Sedinvicem diligere, est non sicut se diligunt, qui
corrumpunt, nec sicut se diligunt homines, quoniam homines sunt, sed quoniam
Dij sunt, and filij altissimi omnes, ut sint filio ejus unico fratres, ea
dilectione invicem diligentes, qua ipse dilexit eos. S. Aug. Tract. 65. in
John. Sed nec sic quidem, ab homine homo diligendus est, ut diliguntur carnales

, the father loves the child, the husband his wife; yea too often unnatural
and abominable: when Simeon and Levi become brethren in evil, their impiety
is the groundwork of their Society, and the life of their love: but the bond
of love among Christian men, is spiritual. They love one another, not because
they are men, but because good men, Gods men, godly men. This is the
excellency of true love, to delight in the Saints as they are Saints, for the
excellency of their graces wherewith they are beautified in the kingdom of
grace. Psalm. 16.3. To give them the heart and hand of fellowship, because of
their adoption and sanctification, whereby the favor of God has wonderfully
enobled them, is a noble part, and a noble love. To love persons, beloved of
God, both satisfies others, and assures our own souls that we belong to
God, and truly love God. Every one that loves him that begat Statim fidei,
conjungit dilectionem: quia sine dilectione fides inanis est Christiani
hominis: sine dilectione fides daemonis -- Habet confessionem fidei in timore
poenae non in amore coronae. S. Aug. in loc. tract. 10. tom. 9.
, loves him also that is begotten of him. 1. John 5.1. He that honors Our
father which is in heaven, loves our fellow brethren which are on earth.

from the very Gentiles, and Pagans, who showed one another with astonishment;
Behold how the Christians love one another. They fell not out by the way, they
lived together, loved together, and were ready to die one for another. They
acknowledged every Christian for their brother or sister; every Saint, for a
citizen of the heavenly Jerusalem Jnvenisti Christianum, invenisti civem

brotherly love in his heart. No man can love a good man, but a good man Quod si

were enemies Romans 8.32. Quid de opibus dubitas, cum herum habeas? Origin. (...)
i.e. Superiora ad fruendum, aequalia in future ad convivendum, inferiera ad
dominandum. S. Chrysostom:
, he sent his son to die for us, how can he now, being made his children,
deny us any thing that is good? But our care is to obtain Chastity, Charity,
Patience and innocence, wherewith whosoever is furnished, cannot be properly
counted poor, seeing he wants nothing that is rich in God. Thou see one man
well clad, well attended, his garments laid with Gold-lace Animus hominis
dives, non area appelri solet, quamvis illa sit plena, dum te inanem video,
divitem non putabo; quis dubitet, quin in virtute divitiae positae sint,
quoniam nulla possessio, nulla vis auri, and argenti, pluris, quam virtus
aestimanda est. Cicero.
, and a ring of gold on his finger, but he has no gold nor money in his
purse: thou beholdest another poorly arrayed, newly come from laboring in
Pharohs Brick-kills, but his pockets are full of Jewels and Pearls; which of
these do thou account the richer man? the poor Christian has a rich inside
Cum repletus fueris spiritualibus divitijs pauper eris? Et ille dives ideo
fuit, quia habebat lectum eburneum: and tu pauper es cuius cubiculum cordis
plenum est tantis gemmis virtutum, justitiae, veritatis, charitatis, fidei,
patientiae, tolerantiae? S. Aug. in Psalm. 33.
, though his outside be inglorious. The Carnalist has a beggarly soul, though
his out-side-shew be pompous. If the Grace of Faith, Si fidem invenites
venalem, quantum pro illa dares, quam te voluit deus gratis habere, and
ingratus es? Egent ergo illi divites, egent, and quod est gravius, pane egent.
id. ib.
Hope, or Charity were to be purchased with money, how many thousand would the
soul, that desires salvation by Christ, give for them? Seeing then God has
given them unto his Saints freely, and for nothing, how rich are they in that
Treasure, which no riches can possibly compass? Speak, O my Soul Quid taces
anima, etc? S. Hier. ep. 22.
, is there any thing so rich as God? is there ought so pleasing to God, as the
Soul enriched with God? Thou have two Servants, the one is eloquent, proper
Forte habes servum formosum, staturosum, hene compositum; Sed furem nequam,
fraudulentum, habes autem alium forte parvum statura, deformem facie, color
totrum: Sed fidelem, parcum, sobrium, quem istorum duorum diligis? Si oculos
carnis interrogas, vincit apud te pulcher, injustus: Si oculos cordis, vincit
deformis, fidelis: vides ergo, quod vis, ut exhibent tigi alter, i. e. fidem;
Exhibe illi, and tu S. Aug. in Psalm. 33.
, fair, active; but a liar, false and theevish; the other slow of speech, of
low stature, hard-favoured, but religious, honest, diligent, fast and
faithful; which of these love thou best? fancy perhaps is taken with the
former; but wisdom entertaines the latter. Let the blind world hug her rich
darlings, and vain lovers be ensnared with their beauty; the God of the world,
gives earnest only unto his faithful, though little flock here, and eternal
welcome hereafter into his heavenly family.

Have thou borne the heavy yoke of unjust Ferte patienter, fidei notas,
stigmata Christiana, ecclesiae paupertatem; ferte inquam impudicorum elogia,
virginitatis haeredes. S. Hieron. Tom. 9. Epist. 3.
infamy? has thy innocent name been pursued with groundless surmises, and
tortured upon the cruell-racke of Calumny? These are the Cognizance of virtue,
the colors under which a Christian soldier fights Mat. 5.11, 12. Incipit

coelo, non in terra mercedem promisit esse reddendam; quos manet gloria,

, Such Liveries the world liberally gives to all the Saints to wear: Ignominy
stains on earth, whom glory crowns in Heaven. Have thou lost thy best, thy
dearest friends, nor are they lost, whom heaven receives, Non perdidisti virum,
sed praemisisti, quorum alterum doloris, alterum gaudij est. S. Hier. Tom 1.
Ep. 11. Quod virum amisisti, commune tibi cum alijs est mulieribus. Esto
reliquis mulieribus fortitudinis exemplum, atque perturbatione^ hanc moderare,
ut nec cord concidas, nec dolor supprimare. S. Basil. Tom. 3 Ep. 5. ad
conjugem A^^thaei.
nor are we losers, who retain our God Non moeremus quod talem amisimus: sed
gratias agimus quod habuimus, imo habemus, deo enim vivunt omnes; and quicquid
revertitur ad dominum, in familiae numero computatur. S. Hieron. Ep. 27.
. He is pleased to raise up New in the very place where the Old are interred;
or else to supply their absence, by his own Comfortable presence In Mortis
angustijs, ubi tunc erunt auxilia propinquorum? ubi verba omni inaniora fumo.
S. Hier. Ep. 23.
. Art thou compassed about with the very terrors of death? is the rack showed
thee? art thou menaced with dens of Lions, dungeons, darkness, and formidable
torments? fear none evil; nor these, nor millions such as these amazements
can daunt the soul that loves, and fears nothing save his God. The Cruel
Tyrant often trembles, for fear, when the Innocent rejoice and conquer all
their torments Hinc est illud, quod frequenter cornifice occulto, in authorem
sceleris conscientiae tormenta desaeviunt, and latentem ream, secreta mentis
poena persequitur: nec ullus post culpam impunitati locus est, eum sit reatus
ipse supplicium. Hinc est quod e contrario innocens etiam inter ipsa tormenta
fruitur conscientiae securitate: and cum de poena metuat, de innocentia
gloriatur. S. Hieron. Tom. 9. Ep. 1.
. When Modestus the President threatened Saint Basil Bishop of Caesarea in
Cappadocia Socrates Histor. Eccles. lib. 4. cap. 21.
, with poverty, banishment and death, if he would not without delay conform
himself, and subscribe unto the Religion of his Master Valens the Arian
Emperor: the Bishop entreated him not to change his mind concerning the
execution of those Torments, Ego (inquit Basilius) and hodie and cras idem
futurus sum, utinam vero tu teipsum non mutasses. Creatura enim cum sim,
creaturam adorare, deumque esse profiteri, in animum non inducam meum, etc.
Nicephorus. Histor lib. 11. cap. 18.
saying, he should do him a very great pleasure; to make him lose his Carkeis

and advantage unto him Verum ubi deus nobis periclitatur, ac proponitur, tum

accounted gain. They had an eye, not so much to the danger of the Combat, as
the certainty of the victory, and the excellency of the reward Certaminis

Hieron. Tom. 9. etc.
. The World is our earthly City, from whence when we are banished, we reap the
benefit of returning home to our God. Earthly potencie may make us walk upon
Scorpions Psalm. 44.19. irridemus multiplices, eosque supervacuos illorum

, the Prince of peace, whom whiles we enjoy, what harm can the arm of flesh
do unto us?

After S. Paul accounted all things dung and dross in comparison of Christ,
and expected heaven for a reward; to enjoy Christ was to him both things
present and future, the world, the promise, Kingdom, all Ad confasionem, and
injurias, quas ob praedicandi studium sustinebat, magis quam ad bonorum
oblectamenta properabat, mortem potius, quam vitam appetens, paupertatem, quia
opulentiam, and multo amplius laborem desiderans, quam alij requiem post
laborem: ac moerorem magis eligens, quam alii voluptatem: Studiosius pro
inimicis orans, quam alij adversus inimicos. S. Chrysostom. Tom. 3. de laudibus.
Pauli Hom. 2. Vnum enim illi formidandum erat, atque metuendum, offensa nimirum
dei, nec quicquam aliud omnino; ergo nec desiderabile illi aliud erat nisi
placere semper deo; quia nihil praesentium desiderabat, nec ipsorum aliquid
futurorum. ibid.

Quod enim erat majus omnibus, Christi amore fruebatur, cum hoc beatiorom se
cunctis putabat: cum hac dilectione magis esse extremus optabat, imo etiam ex
numero punitorum, quam sine hac inter summos and honor sublimes. Hoc enim erat
illi maximum and singular tormentum, ab hac charitate discedere, haec erat
illi gehenna, haec sola poena, haec infinita and intoleranda supplicia, etc.
idem ibid.


; The Greatness of Tyrants breathing out fury, troubled him no more, then the
change of the weather; his Chains he esteemed as Crowns, his sorrows as
quiet rest, his dungeon as Paradise, as winged he preached over the world; as
incorporeall he scorned perils, as possessing heaven he was crucified to the
world; and having an Angelicall-minde, he was rapt up into the third heaven.
As infirm bodies endure for a moment the injuries of the cold air, when they
divest themselves, to enjoy the enlivening and reviving comfort of the hot
bathe into which they are descending Nam and qui tempore hyemis vadit ad
halneas, prius asperitatem frigoris nudus patienter excipit, quia eum sequutura
calefactio consolatur: ita certa spes vincit instantem, ut illad quodammodo
esse incipiat quod futurum est, and desinat esse quod praesens est. S. Hieron.
Tom. 9. Ep. 5.
: so Christian Pilgrims resolutely sustain the insufferable miseries and
maladies wherewith they are compassed in this life in confidence to enjoy the
presence of God, and the pleasures at his right hand for ever.

Earthly sorrows are no other then bitter Potions, which we must drink for
our Soules-health Amplectenda est ergo tristitia quae gaudium parit, and non
ejus materia est consideranda: quia saepe per dulcedinem fructus placet quod
amarum horrunt in radice, idem ibid.
: they may displease the delicate taste of flesh and blood; but the sanctified
issues thereof, are plenary joy and peace. They may denude us of somewhat which
would separate us from eternal happiness, but our happiness and comfort in
our God they cannot possibly separate from us Erunt illi delitiae ipse, qui
fecit illum; and delitias ipsas nemo corrumpit, nemo interpellat, nemo aufert.
Quis potens minabitur auferre? quis vicinus malus? qui latro? quis infidiator
tibi tollit deum? and potest tibi tollere totum quod possides corpore, non tibi
tollit eum quem possides cord. S. Aug. in Ps. 84.
. Wherefore, as the woman prepares with care and diligence to entertain and
wade through her inutterable pains in Childe-birth with patient cheerfulness
Quia aviditate nimia liberos cupit, doloris tormentum spernit, dum quod satis
diligit concupiscit, and ante gaudet ex prole, quam contrisietur ex partu, etc.
S. Hieron. tom. 9. Ep. 5.
, in the eagerness of her desire to be crowned with the honor of a Mother: So
in the assured hope to live and reign with our God, let us under-goe the pangs
and throws, which the world throws upon us with humble meekness. The fire
and air do overthrow mountains, rend up rocks, and shake the whole earth to
break forth to their natural place; teaching us to break through all
impediments, throw off all cloggs, break all chains, make way through the very
thickest crowd of all Creatures, to hasten unto the bosom of our beloved God.
Seeing then nothing under Heaven Corpus hoc vigilando fatigatur, stando

likewise discontent us under heaven, so long as we possess our God. But as the

anguish, for joy that a man John. 16.21. Non dixit illud and illud mihi est in

of all his kindred. His principal education and chief abode was in the
famous Cities of Norwich, and London, where it pleased God, so to prosper his
estate, and especially work upon his heart, in the powerful Ministry of the
Word, that he became an experienced, conscionable, and noble Christian Nulli te

having built a free-Schoole, and endowed it for ever with a liberal allowance,
he has happily provided for the education of Posterity, and the instruction

memorial; He was a faithful Man, and feared God above many Nehem. 7.2. Si

out the Poor, Fatherless, Levite and Widow Quae vidua non hujus auxilio

. Some he educated at the most famous University of Cambridge: For others, he

desolate Non divitibus, non propinquis, sed pauperibus, nihil in illis aliud

Pastors. Thus, what oil others vainly and profusely, yea often profanely
wast, on birds and beasts, and Prostitutes Per to enim non meritricula
locupletantur, sed aluntur virgins Christi: non venator and auriga ditantur,
sed sustentantur pauperes Christi. idem. Tom. 9. Ep. 1.

backs, or pamper their full-fed paunches withal, he powered into Gods Lamp Da

, extortion, biting, unmercifulness and injustice, the Epidemicall infection
of these times.

In all these his care and desire was to eschew ostentation and vainglory,
both in life and death; lest he should receive his reward on earth. Latebat,
and non latebat, fugiendo gloriam gloriam merebatur, quae virtutem quasi umbra
sequitur, and appetitores sui deserens, appetit contemptores. idem. Ep. 27. Tu

. Those shows of Piety and devotion, which in too many now adays are only
sheds and shelters of their impiety; were true ensigns, and ornaments in him
of Grace and virtue. Hypocrisy is no affecter of hidden secrecy in duties of
Piety and pity. The Strumpet loves to hear the shrill-sound of the Trumpet,
winging her own praise unto the remotest parts of the world Quae causa est ut
came parlem corporis, quae secretior and occultior est, ad circumcidendum
dominus elegerit? illud sine dubio, ne justitiam nostram coram hominibus
saccremus, sed in occulto coram eo soto, cui soli nihil occultumest, and quem
solum remuntratorem bonorum novimus esse factorum. idem. Tom. 9. Ep. 20.
. She may weep with them that weep, but seldom does she wipe away their
tears, by relieving their sorrows, and healing their soars Nam cum flente
flere, and nihil cum possis flenti confer subsannationis, non pietatis
judicium est: hoc est pie flere cum flentibus, occasiones fletus auferre. idem.
Ep. 14.
. His greatest Employment at home was Reading, Meditation, and Prayer, joined
with resolution to practice the will of his Master, as it was imparted unto him
Lectionem frequenter interrumpat oration, and animam jugiter adhaerentem Deo,
grata vicissitudo sancti operis accendat. S. Hieron. Tom. 9. Ep. 1.
. The sacred Scriptures were his food, the Man of his Counsel, the first he
saluted in the Morning, in the evening the last Ambrosius scribit, nunquam se
cibum Origin praesente, sine lectione sumpsisse, nunquam inijsse somnum nisi
unus e fratribus ex sacris literis personaret. id. Ep. 18.
, his Rule all day long. To silence his care of, and religious behavior in
trayning up his family, he had his limited-houres and times apart, Eligatur
tibi oppor tunus and aliquantulum a familiae strepitu remotus locus, in quem
tu, velut in Portum, quasi ex multa tempestate curarum te recipias, and
excitatos foris cogitationum fluctus secreti tranquillitate componas. Tantum
ibi sit divinae lectionis fludium, tam crebra orationum vices, tam firma and
pressa de futuris cogitatio, ut omnes reliqui temporis occupationes, facile hac
vacatione compenses. idem Ep. 14. Iejunia pro ludo habet, orationem pro
delitijs. idem Ep. 10. Vnim cellulae clausus angustijs, latitudine paradisi
fruebatur. idem Ep. 15.
to fast, pray, and make all his accounts right and strait with his God.
Whereof mark and remarke this one singular instance, found in his Closet after
his death, to clear all dubitation. For the Space of this ten years last
past, his Custom was at the years end to take a Survey of his Temporal
estate, which he having briefly summed up in a sheet of Paper; he made a
godly Prayer Quamquam omne vitae tuae tempus divino debeas operi consecrare;
debet tamen aliquis esse determinatus, and constitutus horarum numerus, quo
before deo vaces, and qui te ad summam animi intentionem velut quadam lege
contineat. Nihil enim in hoc secreto magis agere debes, quam animam divinis
eloquijs pascere, and quantum ei per totam sufficere potest diem, hoc eam
veluticibo pinguiore satiare. idem. Tom. 9. Ep. 1.
, and thanksgiving, which he annexed unto his account*, and left in writing yet
to be seen. One whereof for thy satisfaction and example of Imitation Nam
ferventissimi in terrenis, frigidissimi in coelestibus sumus, and summam in
rebus parvis exhibentes alacritatem, ad maiora torpescimus, celerem habiturae
res finem, sine fine quaruntur. ibid.
, I have verbatim transcribed, and placed at the end. He was very Choice of his
Company, when he came abroad; avoiding when he could, the Places and persons
where Religion dwelt not Ne cogeretur videre, quod contempserat -- nec erubuit
profiteri quod Christo placere cognoverat. S. Hier. Ep. 16.
, lest he should see what grieved him, or say what would rather trouble then
reform others, being moderate in his own cause, and courageous as a Lion in
Gods. His tongue was seasoned so Nihil aliud noverit lingua nisi Christum,
nihil possit sonare, nisi quod sanctum est. idem. Ep. 8. Quic quid dixerit
juratum putes. idem. Ep. 14. Pro otioso verbo rationem reddituri sumus: and
omne quod non aedificat andientes, in periculum vertitur loquentium, ego si
fecero, si dixero quippiam, quod reprehensione dignum est, de Sanctis egredior,
and polluo vocabulum Christi, in quo mihi blandior. idem. Ep. 128.
thoroughly with the Salt of the Sanctuary, and his heart had waded through the
deep waters of long-afflictions, that his conference seasoned others with whom
he conversed. No Society so satisfied his divine mind, as the Sic religiosus
fuit ut cum Sanctis, sic timens deum ut omne consortium cum Clericis haberet,
quos amabat ut fratres, venerabatur ut dominos, cunctis amabilis. idem. Ep. 9.

Qualis quisque est, talium consortio delectari. idem. Ep. 16.


Ministers of Christ, wherein he never found sacietie. Whose common neglect in
the world, he so took to heart; whose necessities he so seriously weighed, and
seasonably relieved: as none whom he embraced returned from him, un-honoured,
or ungratified Quod fecit, non divitiarum magnitudine, sed prudentia
dispensandi. idem Ep. 27.
. As by his constant frequencie in hearing the Word, (whereby he put also much
heart and life into others to draw them to the house of God) and conference
with Preachers, he gained comfort to his soul Nunquam convenit, quin de
Scripturis aliquid interrogaret, nec ut statim acquiesceret, sed moveret e
contrario quaestiones, non ut contenderet, sed ut quarendo discere: earum
solutiones, quas opponi posse intelligebat. idem. Ep. 16. de Marcella.
: so his study was day and night, how by comfort, friendly counsel,
countenance, and care, he might repay their spirituals which he received, by
the advancement of them with his Temporals Nec affectatae sordes, nec
exquisitae munditiae convenient Christiano. idem. Ep. 21. -- noster talibus
usus est vestibus, quibus, arceret frigus: aurum usque ad annuli signaculum
repudians, and magis in ventribus egenorum, quam in Marsupijs recondens. idem.
Ep. 16.
. And wheresoever God placed his favor, no man could more glory in a sincere,
fast, open-hearted, and open-handed friend.

And now behold this poore-mans-treasurer, is called to his account, and
hastens to his end Munerarius pauperum, and egentium candidatus, sic festinat
ad coelum: St. Hieron. Tom. 1. Ep. 26.
. Sickness summons him Cum sanctum corpusculum febrium ardor excoqueret, and
semionimae lectulum vallaret circulus propinquerum, haec in extremo verba
mandabat, orate dominum Iesum, ut mihi ignoscat: quia implere non potui, quod
volebam. idem. Ep. 25.
to prepare, and death tells him he will admit, neither denial, nor delay. With
what joy, contentation, and meekness he embraced the message of the one, and
with what Patience and resolution he did undergo the other, let the many
witnesses declare. In both he taught the Spectators how to desire to die, and
what was the ripe fruit of a good-Conscience and a godly life Nasci non
nostrum, nec longum vivere nostrum; Vitam quae sequitur, vita parare potest.

Having clearly testified his unfeigned love, by his bounty unto his deare-wife
and friends, and recommended his hearty respects, to be by her continued for
ever unto his friends in General, and to some others by name Scit ipsa, cui
libellus hic scribitur, me non audita sed nota narrare, nec ex aliquo solum in
me beneficio, scriptorum more Graecorum gratiam lingua reddere. Procul a

, (whom he resigned with charge unto her Christian affections, for his sake, as
our Lord did his mother unto his beeloved John. Woman, behold thy son; son,
behold thy Mother;) he commended and yielded his body to the Grave Reversa est

dierum ac luminis. idem Ep. 9.

A Prayer of Mr Fawcitt, mentioned Page 123. *
O Blessed Lord God, what am I, or what was my fathers house, that thou
should continue unto me so many blessings of this life, both for the soul,
and body, in such a bountiful and liberal manner? It is thy merciful
goodness, without any desert in me. Who desire with all humble
thankfulness, as to take notice of thy great goodness unto me; in giving
me a liberal child's portion: so to acknowledge my self unworthy the least of
all thy mercies. For Lord thou know I was borne in sin, and conceived in
iniquity, and according to my polluted birth, so have I lived, sinning against
thy divine Majesty. Not only in the time of ignorance (for thou would in
mercy have passed by that) but in the receipt of all thy goodness; since I was
called to the profession of thy name, and made acquainted with thy good will
and word, I have more grievously sinned against thee. In regard whereof, I am
not worthy to lift up mine eyes toward heaven: the least of my sins, being
sufficient to cast me down to hell, if thou should enter into judgment with
me. In the remembrance whereof I desire to be humbled before thee. And am sorry
from the bottom of my heart, and soul that ever I did offend so good,
gracious, merciful, and loving a God, that has preserved, and kept me all the
days of my life, and not long since delivered me from going down to the
grave. Good father of heaven I beseech thee for the Lord Jesus sake, in whom
thou art well peased, to pardon and forgive all my sins, and foolish behavior
against thy blessed majesty which is past, and enable me for the time to come
to walk before thee as becomes thy child and servant: That I may mortify
sin daily, and bring it into a consumption in me; and thy blessed spirit may
ever rule and Lord it in me. Fill me with all wisdom and understanding, that
I may labor by all means to be fruitful in all good works, and please thee
in all things. That it may be always my chief care to grow and increase in
the favor and knowledge of thee, and thy blessed Son, my alone Savior and
redeemer the Lord Jesus; and thy blessed spirit my comforter, whom rightly to
know, and believe faithfully is eternal life. Help hereunto, good father,
from whom comes the will and deed. And strengthen me unto all godly patience,
and long sufferance with cheerfulness, giving always thanks unto thee, O
father of heaven, who have always assisted, helped and comforted me, in all
thy loving chastisements, afflictions, necessities, and troubles of this life.
O my soul praise thou the Lord, for he has done great things for thee. Thou
have of thy unspeakable goodness bestowed upon me a liberal portion of the
outward things of this life: increasing my store, but all these things had been
nothing if thou had not also given me the testimony of thy love in Jesus
Christ, sent into the world to redeem my poor soul. Grant Lord I may not set
my heart upon these temporal mercies, but make them unto me pledges of thy
love and favor in Christ, grant me the assistance of thy good spirit to direct
me in the conscionable use of them, to thy glory, make them as means and
furtherances for the doing of thy will, that whatsoever I enjoy in this life, I
may employ to the advancement of thy praise, and the good of them among whom I
live. As thou have added to my outward estate, so Lord increase thy graces in
my soul, without which my comfort in them will vanish, all things coming
alike to all men, the difference being in the holy use of all thy mercies.
Wherefore make them so many bonds to lead me to repentance, and to take all
opportunities whereby I may express how I prize that love of thine showed unto
me, unto thy children, as their necessities do require whilst I live, before I
go hence and be seen no more. Loving thee for thy goodness, and doing good to
thy saints and servants, for thy sake: Lord, what shall I render unto thee for
all these great and unspeakeable blessings? O that I could praise thee as I
ought! Lord help me to awaken and stir up my dead, drowsy, and deceitful
heart, awake my lute, my harp, my glory, my soul, and all that is within me
to praise and magnify thy holy name. I will praise the Lord whilst I have any
being, for his gracious favors toward me. Which I beg at thy most merciful
hands to continue unto me, even unto the end of my life. And when thy pleasure
shall be to take me from this world, and the miseries thereof, grant me to
enjoy with thee, O blessed father, and thee, O blessed Savior, and thy blessed
Spirit, that everlasting inheritance, which thou have laid up in heaven, for
me, and all them that love thee in truth of heart. And seeing next under thy
Majesty, the Majesty of Charles our most religious and dread Sovereign is the
channel, and fountain of all the happy peace, plenty, prosperity we enjoy,
together with the most peaceable, pure and plentiful preaching of thy sacred
word, Lord power upon him in the most abundant measure, all spiritual,
eternal, and temporal mercies that he may be blessed in his person: in our
gracious Queen Mary, and his most royal issue, and this Church and Common
wealth in him, her, and them, so long as the Sun and Moon endures. All which
blessing, vouchsafe to grant for the Lord Jesus sake, to whom with thy self,
and holy spirit be given of me, all honor, praise and glory, now and for ever,
world without end. In whose words and perfect platform of prayer I humbly
recommend my suits unto thee O father, saying: Our Father, etc.
