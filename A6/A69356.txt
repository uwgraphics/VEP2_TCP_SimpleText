A COPY OF A LETTRE SENT TO PREACHERS.

The copy of a letter sent to all those Preachers, which the Kings Majesty
has licensed to preach from the Lord Protectors grace, and others of the
Kings Majesty's most honorable counsel the.xxiii. day of May, in the
second year of the reign of our soue reign Lord King Edward the VI.
AFter our right hearty comme^dacions: As Well for the conseruacion of the
quietness and good order of the Kings Majesty's subjects, as that theishould
not by evil and unlearned Preachers be brought unto supersticio^, erxor, or
evil doctrine, or otherwise be made stubborn and disobedient, to the Kings
Majesty's Godly procedynges, his highness by our advise, has thought good to
inhibite all manner of Preachers, who has not such license, as in the same
proclamation is allowed to Preach, or stir the people in open and common
Preachynges or Sermones by any means, that the devout and Godly Homilies
might the better in the mean while sincke into his subjects hearts, and be
learned the sooner, the people being not tossed to and from with sedicious and
contencious preaching, while every man according to his zeal, some better some
worse, goes about to set out his own fantasy, and to draw the people to
his opinion. Nevertheless, it is not his Majesty's mind, hereby clearly to
extinct the lively teaching of the word of God, by Sermones made after such
sort, as for the time the holy ghost, shall put in to the preachers mind: But
that rash, contencious, hot and indiscreet Preachers should be stopped: and
that they only which be chosen and elect, discrete and sobre menue, should
occupy that place, which was made for edificacion, and not for destruccio^,
for the honor of God and peace and quietness of conscience to be set forward,
not for private glory to be auaunced: tappeace, to teach, to instruct ye
people with humility and patience: not to make them contencious and proud:
to instill into them their duty to their heddes and rulers, obedience to
Laws and ordres appointed by the superiors, who has rule of God, not that
every man should run before their heddes has appointed them what to do, and
that every man should chose his own way in religion. The which thing yet
being dooen of some men, and they being rather provoked there to by certain
preachers, then dehorted from it, it was necessary to set a stay therein. And
yet forsomuche, as we have a great confidence and trust in you, that you will
not only preach truly and sincerely the word of God, but also will use
circumspeccion and moderacion in your Preaching, and such Godly wisedo^ as
shall be necessary, and most convenient for the time and place we have sent
unto you, the Kings Majesty's license to Preach, but yet with this
exhortation and admonishement: That in nowise you do stir, and provoke the
people, to any alteracion, or innouacion, other then is already set furthe by
the kings majesty's Iniunccions, Homeltes, or Proclamacions. But contrariwise,
that you do in all your sermones, exhort men to that which is at this time
more necessary, that is to the emendacion of their own life's, to the
obseruaunce of the commandments of god, to humility, patience, and
obedience to their heddes and rulers: Confortyng the weak, and teaching the^
the right way, and to flee all old and erroneous supersticio^s: as the
confidence in Pardons, Pilgrymages, Beads, Religions, Images, and other such
of the bisshoppe of Romes Tradicions, and supersticio^s, with his usurped
power, the which things be here in this realm, most justly abolished: and
straightly rebukyng those, who of an arrogancy and proud hastines, will take
upon them to run before they be sent, to go before the rulers to alter and
change things in religion, without auchoritie: teaching them to expecte, and
tarry the time which God has ordained to the reuealyng of all truth, and not
to seek so long blyndly and hedlynges after it, till they bring al ordres into
contempt: It is not a private man's duty, to alter Ceremonies, to innouate
ordres in the Church, nor yet it is not a Preachers part, to bring that in
contempt and hatered, which the Prince does either allow, or is content to
suffer. The Kings highness by our advise, as a Prince most earnestly given to
the true knowledge of God, and to bring up his people therein, does not cease
to labor and travail, by all Godly means, that his realm might be brought
and kept, in a most Godly and Christian order, who only may and ought to do
it: why should a private manne or a Preacher, take this royal and kyngly
office upon him? and not rather as his duty is, obediently follow himself, and
teach likewise other to follow, and observe that which is commanded. What is
abolished, taken away, reformed, and commanded, it is easy to se by the
Acts of Parliament, the Iniunccions, Proclacions, and Homelies: The which
things most earnestly it behooves all Preachers in their Sermones, to
confirm and approve accordynly: in other things which be not yet touched, it
behooves him to think, that either the prince does allow them or else suffer
them: and in those it is the part of a Godly manne, not to think himself
wiser then the Kings Majesty and his counsel, but patiently to expect and to
conform himself thereto, and not to entermedle farther to the disturbaunce of a
realm the disquietyng of the Kings people, the troublyng of men's
consciences, and disordre of the Kings subjects. These things we have
thought good, to admonish you of at this time, because we think you will,
set the same so forward in your preaching, and so instruct the kings
majesty's people accordyngly, to the most auauncement of the glory of God,
and the kings majesty's most Godly procedynges: that we do not doubt, but
much proffite shall ensue thereby, and great conformity in the people the
which you do instruct: and so we pray you not to fail to do, and having
aspeciall regard, to the weakness of the people, what they may bear, and what
is most convenient for the time, in no case to entermeddle in your sermones
or otherwise, with matters in co^tencion, or controuersion: Except it be to
reduce the people in them also to obedience, and following of such ordres as ye
Kings Majesty has all ready set forth, and no others: as the kings
Majesty and our trust is in you, and as you tender his highness will and
pleasure, and will answer to the contrary at your peril.

Fare you well.
