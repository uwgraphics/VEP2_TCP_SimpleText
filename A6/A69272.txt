The lamentable fall of Queen Elnor, who for her pride and wickedness, by
Gods Judgment, sunk into the ground at Charing cross, and rose up again at
Queen hiue.
To the tune of, Gentle and Courteous.
WHen Edward was in England King
the first of all that name:
Proud Elnor he made his Queen,
a stately Spanish dame.
Whose wicked life and sinful pride,
through England did excel:
To dainty Dames and gallant Maids
this Queen was known full well.
She was the first that did invent
in Coaches brave to ride:
She was the first that brought this land
The deadly sin of pride.
No English Tailors here could serve
to make her rich attire:
But sent for Tailors into Spain,
to feed her vain desire.
They brought in fashions strange and new
with golden garments bright:
The Farthingales, and mighty Ruffes,
with Gowns of rare delight.
(...) Dames in Spanish pride,
(...) ^^ery where,
(...)^^ke Women then,
(...) ^^^^s of hair.
(...) maid and wife,
(...)Spain:
(...) ^^ylors then,
(...)
(...)dispite,
(...) ^nglish-men.
(...) ^estures clad, as brau^ ^o see
(...) any Spaniard then.
She craved the King that every man
that wore long locks of hair,
Might then be cut and powled all,
or shaven very near.
Whereat the King did seem content,
and soon thereto agreed:
And first commanded that his own,
should then be cut with speed.
And after that to please his Queen,
proclaimed through the land,
That every man that wore long hair,
should powle him out of hand.
(...) ^et this Spaniard not content,
(...) ^omen bore a spite:
(...) ^^^n requested of the King
(...) all law and right:
(...) ^^^^y womankind should have,
(...)^reast cut away:
(...) ^urning Irons seared
(...) ^^aunch and stay.
(...) then perceiving well
(...) ^o women-kind.
Devised soon by policy
to turn her bloody mind.
He sent for burning Irons straight,
all sparkling hot to see:
And said, O Queen, come on thy way
I will begin with thee.
Which words did much displease the Queen
that penance to begin:
But ask him pardon on her knees,
who gave her grace therein:
But afterward she chaunst to pass
along brave London streets:
Whereas the Mayor of Londons wife,
in stately sort she meets.
With music, mirth, and melody,
unto the Church that went:
To give God thanks that to L. Mayor
a noble Son had sent.
It grieved much this spiteful Queen
to see that any one
Should so exceed in mirth and joy,
except her self alone:
For which she after did devise,
within her bloody mind,
And practisde still most secretly
to kill the Lady kind.
Unto Lord Mayor of London then
she sent her letters straight:
To send his Lady to the Court,
upon her Grace to weight.
But when the London Lady came,
before proud Elnors face:
She stripped her from her rich array,
and kept her vile and bace.
She sent her into Wales with speed,
and kept her secret there:
And used her still more crueller
then ever man did hear:
she made her wash, she made her startch
she made her drudge always:
She made her nurse up children small,
and labor night and day.
But this contented not the Queen,
but showed her more despite:
She bound this Lady to a post
at twelve a clock at night:
And as poor Lady she stood bound
the Queen in angry mood,
Did set two Snakes unto her breasts,
that sucked away her blood.
Thus died the Mayor of Londons wif
most grievous for to hear:
Which made the Spaniard grow more proud
as after shall appear.
The Wheat that daily made her bred
was boulted twenty tunes,
The food that fed this stately Dame,
was boylde in costly wines.
The water that did spring from ground
she would not touch at all,
But washed her hands with dew of deauen,
that on sweet Roses fall:
She bathed her body many times,
in fountains filde with milk,
And every day did change attire,
in costly median silk.
But coming then to London back,
within her Coach of gold:
A tempest strange within the skies,
this Queen did there behold.
Out of which storm she could not go,
but there remained a space,
Four horses could not stir her coach
a foot out of that place.
A judgment surely sent from heaven
for she doing guiltless blood,
Upon the sinful Queen that slew
the London Lady good:
King Edward then, as wisdom wild
accusde her for that deed:
But she demed and wished that God
would send his wrath with speed.
If that upon so vile a thing,
her heart did ever think,
She wished the ground might open wid^
and therein she might sink:
With that at Charing cross she sunk
into the ground alive,
And after rose with life again
in Londan at Queen hiue.
Where after that she languisht sore
full twenty days in pain:
At last confessed the Ladies blood,
her guilty hands did stain.
And likewise how that by a Friar
she had a base borne child,
Whose sinful lust and wickedness
her marriage bed defilde.
Thus have you heard the fall of pride,
a just reward of sin:
For those that will forswear the^selue^
Gods vengeance daily win.
Beware of Pride you London dames,
both wives and maidens all,
Bear this imprinted in your mind,
that Pride will have a fall.
FINIS.
Printed at London for William Blackwall.
