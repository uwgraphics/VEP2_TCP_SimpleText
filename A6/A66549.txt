A COPY OF V^^^^^ Made by that Reverend Man of God Mr. John Wilson, Pa^^or
first Church in Boston; On the sudden Death of MR. Joseph Brisco, Who was
translated from Earth to Heaven Jan. 1. 1657.
Not by a Fiery Chariot as Elisha was.
But by the Water, which was the outward cause:
And now at Rest with Christ his Savior dear,
Though he has left his dear Relations here.
^^gra(...) Joseph Brisoe

THere is no Job but cries to God (...)
And God his ear in Christ; to (...)
Out of the deeps to him I (...)
And unto me his gracious (...)
Doubt not of this ye that my death be (...)
What if it did so strangely me assail;
What if I was so soon in Waters drown^
And when I cried to men, no help I found:
There was a God in Heaven that heard my cry*
And looked upon me with a gracious eye,
He that did pity Joseph in his grief,
Sent from above unto my soul relief:
He sent his Angels who did it conveigh
Into his Bosom, where poor Laz'rus lay:
Let none presume to censure my estate,
As Job his Friends did stumble at his Fate.
All things on Earth do fall alike to all,
To good Disciples, which on God that call,
To those that do Blespheme his Holy Name,
And unto those that reverence the same;
He that from nature drew me unto Grace,
And looked upon me with a Fathers face:
When in my blood upheld me to the last,
And now I do of joys eternal taste.
Remember how Job'^ ^^^cious children Died,
As also what the (...)t did betide* Jonah

What was the end of g^^d Josiah's life,
And how it fared with Ezekiels Wife:
Remember what a Death it was that Christ
((...) Darling of the highest;
His Death of De^^^ has quite removed the sting,
No matter how (...) here the Lord does bring
Us to our end, in Christ who live and die
And sure to live with Christ eternally.
