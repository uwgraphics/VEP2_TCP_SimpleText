Translated into Latin, by Mr. WALTER DENNESTONE.

Printed in the Year, MDCXCI.

TO THE VIRTUOSI.
YE Virtuosi hav't to you assigned
The Natural causes of all things to find.
We cloth the Fairies in their proper dress:
And leav't to you, What force they have? to guess.
AD PHILOSOPHOS.
NAturam, and veras rerum perpendere caussas
Sort datum vobis, Ingeniosa cobors.
Corpra nos Lemurum tenui velamus amictu:
Dicite vos, Quae vis? quis vigor insit eis?
On the KING of FAIRY.
UPon a time the Fairy Elves,
Having first arrayed themselves,
Thought it meet to cloth their King,
In Robes most fit for Revelling.
(2)
He had a Cobweb-Shirt more thin,
Than ever Spiders since could spin;
Bleach'd in the whiteness of the Snow,
When the Northern Winds do blow.
(3)
In that Waste and open Air
No Shirt half so Fine or Fair:
A rich Waste Coat they did bring
Made of the Trout-flies Golden Wing.
(4)
Died Crimson in a Maidens blush.
And lined with Humming Bees soft Plush.
At which his Elf-ship 'gan to fret
And swear 'twould cast him in a sweat.
(5)
He for his Coolness needs would wear
A Waste coat made of Downy Hair,
New taken from an Eunuchs Chin,
It pleased him well; 'twas wondrous thin.
(6)
His Hat was all of Ladies love,
So passing light that it would move
If any Goat or Humming Fly
But beat the Air in passing by.
(7)
About it went a wreath of Pearl
Dropped from the Eyes of some poor Girl,
Pincht because she had forgot
To leave clean Water in the Pot,
(8)
His Breeches and his Cassock were
Made of the Tinsel Garsummer:
Down it is seam there went a lace
Drawn by an unctuous Snails slow pace.
In Oreadum Regem.
MOnticolae quondam Lamiae circundatae amictu
Corpora praetenui choreis and lusibus apto;
Talibus inde suum Regem quoque vestibus ornant
Quae deceant numerosque leves festasque choreas.
(2)
Ejus araneoli scutulata subucula filo
Rarior, eximiae quod texuit artis Arachne:
Intactaeque nivis fuit insolata nitore,
Quam rigidus gelida Boreas diffundit ab Arcto.
(3)
Nec sub Hyperboreo tam pura camisia tractu
Usque adeo tenuis tamque alba apparuit usquam:
Proxima cura fuit tunicellam imponere Regi
Hepiali textam mire ex aurantibus alis.
(4)
Virginis eximiae roseo quae tincta rubore,
Atque apis Hyblaeae duplicata est vellere molli:
Tum fremere and jurare Heroes gestamine tanto
Pressus, and exili manare a corpore sudor.
(5)
Post, refrigerii caussa, subtle theristrum
Curari fecit consutum more decoro,
Nuper ab Eunuchi mala and lanugine sumptum:
Hoc placuit, quia erat tenui subtemine textum.
(6)
Ejus erat (capit is tegumentum insigne) galerus,
U^ referunt, e femineo conflatus amore;
Qui levis usque adeo fuit ut trepidaret ad auram,
Quam musca aut cynips praetervolitando feriret.
(7)
Ambijt hunc circum speciosa and gemmea spira
Ex oculis tenerae tremulis modo lapsa puellae;
Quam male multarunt Lemures quod linquere in olla
Oblita est puras, nocturno tempore, lymphas.
(8)
Denique fiebant saga cum femoralibus ejus
Lineola e tenui per summa cacumina campi
Extena, quorum suturam rara tegebat
Iustita ducta pigri limacis tramite pingui.
On the QUEEN.
NO sooner was their King attyr'd
as never Prince had been,
But as in duty was required
they next array their Queen.
(2)
Of shining thread shut from the Sun
And twisted into line,
On the light Wheel of Fortune Spun
was made her Smock so fine.
(3)
Her Gown was very colored fair
The Rainbow gave the dip;
Persumed by an amber Air,
Breathed from a Virgins lip.
(4)
The Stuff was of a Morning dawn
When Phoebus did but peep,
But by a Poets Pencil drawn
In Chloris lap asleep.
(5)
Her Vail was white and pale-faced by
Invented by a Maid,
When she (poor Soul) by some bad spy
Had newly been betrayed
(6)
Her Necklace was of subtle tie
Of glorious Atoms, set
In the pure Black of Beauties eye,
As they had been in Jet.
(7)
Her Shoes were all of Maiden-Heads
So passing thin and light
That all her care was how to treed;
A thought had burst them quite.
(8)
The revells ended, she put off
Because her Grace was warm:
She fanned her with a Ladies scoff.
And so she took no Harm.
FINIS.
In REGINAM.
POstquam Rex tali fuit insignitus a mictu
Membra cui Regum nulla tulere parem.
Mox etiam, veluti ratio poscebat and aequum,
Reginae parili corpora vest tegunt.
(2)
Illius ex auro clara de lampade solis
Emisso, site facta erat interula.
Stamina cujus erant solerti pollice ducta,
Sortis in ambiguae torta levique rota.
(3)
Palla fuit, qualem spectabilis induit Iris,
Quam varius radiis pingit Apollo suis.
Talis odor, qualis fragranti spirat ab ambra,
Halitus aut qualis Virginis esse solet.
(4)
Materies fuit Aurorae de lumine primo
Phoebus ubi Eois surgit honorus aquis.
Peniculo vatis qui pingebatur amatae
Chloridis in gremio membra quiet levans.
(5)
Candidulumque habuit velamen, pallidulumque,
Dextra puellaris texuit illud opus.
Qui color idem erat ac pellucet in ore puellae
Prodita ab infausto quae modo forte viro.
(6)
Illius alba decens ornabat colla monile
Formosum pulchris conspicuisque atomis:
Quae velut in puro nigroque gagate fuissent
Impositae, miris emicuere modis.
(7)
Calceolique sui perquam tenuesque levesque
Facti de claustris virginitatis erant.
His igitur verita est incedere, namque pusillus
Sensus amoris cos rumperet absque mora.
(8)
Ludis exactis, quoniam sudore madebat
Confestim vestes exuit ipsa suas.
Et se femineo vannavit scommatc demum
Nec quidquam damni pertulit inde sibi.
FINIS.
