To the WORSHIPFVLL, Robert Tracy, Esquire
Coronet of Horsemen to the Right Honorable, Edward, Viscount Conoway, Lord
General of the Horse.
SIR,
AS your worth is known in many parts here at home, so from many parts abroad,
MERCVRY is come to be known of you. It was the prime praise of Ulysses, that he
had seen many Cities, and known the manners or minds of many men: If there be
any true content and pleasure of the mind here on earth, it is gained in
travel and the view of variety of places; beside those brave spirits that love
to see the world abroad, are of another mould than our dull drones that keep
their homes and their hives, and, except smoked out, will scarce fly over to
the next field; when the other imitating the celestial bodies, as Lipsius
says, Gaudent motu, delight in motion, and bring home the sweet honey of
Experience, whereby they become most useful above any other to their King and
Country. I shall not need to touch the manifold use of Travel, or relate that
unto you, which you know above many others; being as one said of Hermogenes,
Senex in ipsa juventute, endued with virtuous and many excellent parts above
your years. I dare not be over tedious or troublesome, only I desire you would
be pleased to entertain our MERCVRY, with no other respect and good will, than
he in all love and duty, tenders himself and his service unto you.

Your most devoted and obliged, James Wadsworth.

To the Right Honoroble, Noble, and Worshipful, the Nobility and Gentry of
England, addicted to History or Travel.
R. Honorable,
I Entreat you to accept of this Dedication, it being for the good of all
those that have traveled, or desire to travel: for the one, it will instruct,
and to the other, it will be necessary for the help of his memory. Look not on
the smalnesse of the gift, but on the good will and affection wherewith I have
translated it out of Italian into English, hereunto having also added many
notes and observations of my last travels which I made these last two years
through Spain, Italy, and France. The work, I dare not say, deserves your
protection, it being a greater token of Nobility, in you to patronize with your
greatness that which is mean in it self, than only to be favorable where merit
may challenge liberality; yet the work is necessary for all this Kingdom, rich
or poor, traveller or not traveller, wherein they may al benefit themselves,
it serving for a guide to those that go abroad, and a Map for those at home. So
I humbly take my leave, desiring the Almighty to bless and prosper you, and
conclude with this Spanish Adage or Proverb, Lo que mata auno sana a otro, and
say to the Critique that shall condemn that which he cannot mend himself,
That which is one man's meat, is another man's poison. Let the more judicious
judge. vale.

Your Honors, in all service, J. W.

The Translator to the Reader.
HAving in my last travels at Venice found a Book in Italian descrying the
public road ways through the principallest parts of Europe, composed by
three brethren of the most Illustrious Marquess of Cravesana in Italy, I
thought good, by the advice of some Noble personages, to translate it into
English, adding thereunto mine own experience, for the general good of this
my native Country: and because the Reader should not mistake any thing in it,
I have here set down some few observations and directions, for his more easier
understanding of it. Imprimis, let him note that the stages beginning at Rome,
and continuing thence to Bruxells or Paris, you must take them backward,
beginning at Bruxells or Paris, and so to Rome. Item, note that there is in
many places put nowne 8 miles for 9, and the like is done in leagues; and in
other places 9 miles for 8, the reason is that it is not yet decided among
them, whether it be 8 or 9 miles, and so of the leagues for some say one thing,
some another, as some will say it is 8 long miles, and others will say it is 9
short miles, wherefore this needs not trouble the traveller, there never being
in a days journey above a mile or two different in their opinions. Item, note
that every Town is written in his own natural language, and after the
Italian Pronounciation, which is the easiest for the English to p^onounce or
learn. As for Example, Sivill, a City in Spain, the Italian write it
Siguilla, and the Spaniard Sevilla: and so Madril, the Italian writes it
Madrith, and the Spaniard Madrid. I shall not here need to treat of the
manifold and excellent use of Travail to understanding spirits, who as Lipsius
truly says, like the heavenly Spheres delight in motion, whi^est the others
tanquam affixi suo solo, love to keep their station, who knowet^ not how the
greatest Philosophers, as Aristotle, Plato and the rest, with the best
Mathematicians and Physicians, and in a word, the most useful to their
Country have been travelers. So entreating the Reader to pardon what he
shall see a^isse, and gently to correct the errors, if he find any, I rest:
vale.

Your devout friend, to do his Country and Countrymen service, I. W.

Quicupis Europae Lector percurrere fines,
A patria tut as and minus ire vias,
Dux hic noster erit paruus (mi^i Creed) li^ellus,
Quem tibi conquir as; aere perexiguo.
Thou that would knowledge and experience gain,
By traveling France, Italy and Spain,
With other parts, be Mercury thy guide,
And censure when his Journall thou have tried.
This winged Post, that leads to all parts,
Will guide thee to most Fayres, Staples and Marts;
To Academes, the nurseries of Arts:
The goodly Towns of Florence, Rome and Naples.
That when thou art returned thou may say,
Thanks to thy guide, and never grudge his pay.

Authors have already performed the same.

The Preface to the Reader.
OBserve diligent Reader, thou that would travel, and desire to know the
Road way through all Christendom, that in this small volume I have described
and named the most part of all the stages now in use throughout most parts of
the world, commonly called in Italian, Posta per posta, viz. that is to say,
from stage to stage, and from place to place, with the distance of the miles
from the one to the other, with the names of the Cities, Lordships, Castles,
Markets, towns and Innes, where the postouses are kept in Italy, and out of
Italy, France, Spain* Portugal, Flanders, Vienna and Germany; Kingdom of
Naples, Messina, Puglia, and the land of Otranto, and diverse other parts in
Italy and Christendom, beginning at the City of Rome, and from thence from
place to place, as this Book does set forth, whereunto is added an Index or
Table for the Reader or curious Traveller, with more ease to find out the said
places, which is a thing very pleasant for those that desires to know the
Road-w^yes thorowout Christendom, and much more p^ofitable and necessary for
him that shall make use hereof in his travel; as also by the reading hereof he
shall find diverse remarkable notes and observations of the chief and
principal Cities of Italy and other Countries.

A relation or description of the City of Rome, and the seven Principal
Churches.
HAving in all the sequel of this book discribed the places, towns, cities
churches, relickes, and other remarkable things: I should wrong my self, and
all the world might blame me, if in some part I should not descrie and write
something of the Mother city of the world, (or Mundi Caput) Rome. Wherefore
with that brevity that may be granted me, I say that Rome was Founded by
Romulus and Remus; and it is now called Rome, Cap^^ Mundi: Because it has
already mastered all the world, and it has been far bigger than it is at
this present; and through the midst thereof runs a pleasant River called
Tiber, by the which is brought all necessaries for the sustenance of mankind,
and other commodities to a place called Ripa; where there does arrive diverse
ships from diverse parts and Regions of the world, richly laden: and if Rome
were deprived of this same River but for the space of three Months, it would
be starved, and there would be no abode or abiding therein; considering the
great court and train of the Pope, Cardinals, Dukes, and Princes, Marquesses
and Earls, Archbishops, Bishops, Barons, and Abbots, Ambassadors of all
Christians Princes: all which, and a great number of Gentry, and Commonalty,
besides an infinite number of Abbeys, Monasteries, Colleges and religious
Houses; all which by reason of the benefit of the said River Tibur, do live
cheap and plentifully, as it is daily seen; besides, the city is endowed with
all commodities, pleasures, and delights, that this world can afford; which I
leave to the judgment of him that has seen it, or shall see it. And amongst
all the notable and remarkable things of the said city, There are seven
principal Churches; the first is called S. John Laterano, which in former
times was the Palace of the Popes of Rome, and it stands upon Mount Celeo, and
was built by Constantine the Great, being by him endowed with great revenewes
and riches: and all the court and people of Rome, bear a great devotion and
reverence to that Church, the first Sunday of Lent; It being their first Stage
of pilgrimage, where they gain infinite Pardons and Indulgences. This church
was burnt by the enemies of the Sea of Rome, wherein there was an infinite
company of rediculous relics of Saints. Amongst the rest (says my Author) was
the head of Pancratio a Martyr; which head for the space of three days did
nothing but run blood, and could not be burnt with the rest of the relics;
which still remains. Likewise, in the same church, there is the back bone of
S. Lawrence; also the milk and hair of our blessed Lady, and the very
Garment and shirt that she made for our Savior: As also the heads of the
glorious Apostles S. Peter and S. Paul. And before the high Altar of the said
church, there are four hollow Pillars richly wrought, being filled with holy
earth brought from Jerusalem, with diverse other relics and great Devotions,
which for brevitie sake I omit; besides the infinite Pardons and Indulgences,
which are continually granted to those that visit the said church, and
especial the Pardons which are granted every Saturday to those that visit the
same.

The second church is S. Petr^ in Vaticano; joining unto it is the Popes
Palace, and residence, which formerly was kept at S. John a Latteranes, which
for to discribe at large would take up a whole volumne; there be such variety
of Courts, Galleries, and Gardens, that a man can scarce view it in a whole
day: And the like Library is not in the Christian world. In the church, The
Station is the day of the Epiphanie. the first and fifth Sunday in Lent, and
all the Frydayes in March; all which days there are infinite Indulgences, and
Pardons granted to those that shall visit the said church. There is also in the
said church seven Altars, which serve in stead of the seven Churches for those
that are not able to visit the rest, which seven Altars have the same Pardons
and Indulgences that the same churches have: There are also (says my Author)
bodies of many Saints: amongst the rest is the head of S. Andrew, the Apostle,
and under one of the Altars which is the Altar of S. Andrew lies half his
body, as also half of the body of S. Paul; and at the going in of the said
church at the right hand near unto the holy gate or Porta Sancta, is kept that
holy and miraculous hand-kerchiefe, which has the true stamp and figure of our
Savior, which he left at the same time (in the hand-kerchiefe) when he
carried the Cross to Mount Calvary. There is also the iron of the spear which
pierced his side, the which was sent by the great Turk to Innocentius the
eight, Pope of Rome. There are also many other holy Relics, that came from
Jerusalem, which for brevitie sake I omit. I will say nothing of the
beautiful, magnificent, and unestimable workmanship thereof: Only, that when
it is finished (whereof it wants but a little) it may be called the greatest
and most beautiful Church in the world.

The third church is called Saint Paul's church, which stands a mile out of
Rome, in the way which leads to Ostia. This church was built, and endowed with
great riches and ornaments, by Constantine the great, and built in the same
place where Saint Paul's head was found. The said church is very stately and
fair, adorned with most miraculous Pillars: herein is a great Station and
Indulgences; and there are 7 altars as in S. Peter's Church, which have the same
Indulgences and Pardons, and there are the bodies of diverse Saints; as of the
Innocents, an arm of S. Anna mother to the virgin Mary, and the Chair
wherewith S. Paul was chained when he was in Prison, and the head of the
Samaritan, and half the body of S. Peter* and S. Paul, with infinite other
Relics; and at the right hand of the high Altar, is that Crucifix which spoke
unto S. Briget, which has granted many Indulgences and Pardons.

The Fourth Church is S. Mary the Great, and it is said that this Church was
the first in the World that was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Here is a great
Station, and many Indulgences granted and confirmed by many Popes: and in the
said Church is buried the bodies of many Saints, and there is kept for a Relick
the Manger that our Savior was borne in, at Bethlehem; and it is endowed with
many vessels and ornaments of gold and silver, which were given thereunto by
diverse Popes.

The fifth Church, is the Church of Saint Laurence, out of the walls of Rome a
mile, in the way called Via Tiberia: In the same Church lies the body of S.
Laurence, and the body of S. Steven, and one of the stones that stoned him to
death, and the stone whereon Saint Laurence after his death was laid, all being
died with his blood and fat, after he was taken off the Gridiron; as also a
piece of the Gridiron whereon he was broyled, with many other Relics and
Pardons granted thereunto, by several Popes.

The sixth Church is called S. Sebastian, out of the wall of Rome, in the way
called Appia; which Church is endowed with great Indulgences and Stations,
especially in Lent. There is yet in the said Church a Vault and a Wall wherein
the bodies of S. Peter and S. Paul lay hidden a certain space; and whosoever
shall cause a Mass to be said at their Altar in the said church, he shall free
a soul out of Purgatory; and under the said Church is the tomb of Calisto;
and there is great Indulgences granted near unto the place where lies the
bodies of an hundred and seventy thousand Martyrs. In the said Church is
likewise the body of S. Sebastian, with diverse other Relics of Saints.

The seventh Church is called the holy Cross of Jerusalem, and bears the
title of a Cardinalship, and here is a great Station in Lent, great
Indulgences, especially on the days of invention and exaltation of the holy
Cross, and the day of the consecration thereof. And in the Chapel under the
high Altar, no women can go in thereunto: And there lies the bodies of S.
Anastio, and Cesarco, and there is a little Bottle or Ampolla, full of the
precious blood of our Redeemer; there is likewise the Sponge wherewith they
gave him gall and vinegar to drink, when he was upon the cross; there are two
thorns of his Crown, and a Nail wherewith he was nailed unto the cross, and
the Inscription which Pontius Pilate put upon his head; and one of the Thirty
pence for which he was sold; and the holy Cross whereon our Savior was
Crucified, was kept here first, which now is kept at S. Peter's Church, with
infinite Relics and Indulgences hereunto granted by diverse Popes. And so ends
the Description of the seven Churches of Rome: And to speak of the Pyramid
which stands at S. Peter's Church, the two pillars whereon stand the Statues of
S. Peter and S. Paul, the Pantheon which was a Church built by the Heathens and
dedicated to all the gods; the ruins of the Amphiteatrum; the Fountains, the
Caves under the ground, the ancient coins, Statues, the ancient ruins of the
Roman Emperors Palaces, and the present Palaces of Cardinals and Princes,
will take a man half a years time to view them well, with the Monasteries.

GEnoua is a most famous City, both for buildings and antiquity, and by the
opinions of diverse learned men, it is more ancient than Rome; It is proudly and
stately built by the Seaside; neither is it all plain, nor all mountains,
but partakes of both, and is six miles in circuit, and there is 30 Parish
Churches therein, whereof diverse noble men are by Inheritance Patrons of some
of them: And now we will speak something of the Cathedral Church called S.
Laurence, wherein is a Chapel dedicated to S. John Baptist: And there is the
ashes of the said S. John kept in a silver chest, well adorned and set with
precious stones; which ashes work great miracles; among the rest this same
particular: That there raising a great storm upon the Sea, to the endangering
of the shipping and Port; the said chest being carried by the Clergy of the
said Church to the Seaside, the tempests did immediately and miraculously
cease, as my author says.

Likewise there is kept in the Vestry of the said Church, a dish set with
Emeralds, of an inestimable price, in the which our Savior ate his Paschal
Lamb, according to the opinion of many Authors; and it was taken and brought
thither in the taking of Cesarea, as in the Chronicles of Genoua appears more
at large.

There is in the said City diverse Hospitals built for the relief of the sick
and the poor, as also for Pilgrims and Travelers; which are plentifully
adorned with Riches for their maintenance: And there are great Monasteries,
both within and without the said City, worth seeing; and there is a most fair
Ars^nal for building of Galleis and other Vessels.

There is likewise a most famous Darsena or Mold made of stone out of the Sea,
very artificially, by the labor of Man, where the Galleys, and small ships
laden with wines, lie, and they may open and lock it at their pleasures, with a
chain for security.

There is likewise the great Mol, which makes the Port for the great shipping
to lie secure; which was likewise made of stone, by the hand of man, most
artificially, to the great expense of the City.

THe miraculous beginning and translation of the Church of the Lady of Loretto,
taken out of the Original which is engraven in marble with golden letters in
the said Church, Fabulous stories of the Lady of Loreto.
in all Languages: Verbatim, as follows, viz.

The Church of Loretto, says my au^hor, was a Chamber of the house of the
Blessed Vi^gin Mary, nigh Jerusalem in the city of Nazareth, in which she was
borne and breed and saluted by the Angel, and therein conceived and brought up
her son Jesus to the age of twelve years: This chamber after the Ascension of
our blessed Savior was by the Apostles consecrated into a church in honor of
our blessed Lady: And S. Luke made a Picture to her likeness; extant therein
to be seen this very day: It was frequented with great devotion, by the people
of the country where it stood, whilst they were catolicks, but when leaving
the Faith of Christ, they followed the Sect of Mahomet: The Angels took it, and
carrying it into Sclavonia, placed it by a town called Flinnen, where not being
had in due reverence, they again transported it over Sea, to a wood in the
territory of Recanati, belonging to a noble women called Loreta, from whom it
first took the name of our blessed Lady of Loreto: And thence again they
carried it by reason of the many robberies committed) to a mountain of two
brothers in the said Territory: And from thence finaly, in respect of the
disagreement about the gifts and offerings to the common high way, not far
distant, where it now remains, without foundation famous for many signs,
graces and miracles; whereat the Inhabitants of Recanati, who often came to see
it, much wondering, environed it with a strong and thick wall, yet could no man
tell from whence it came originally, till in the year 1296; the blessed Virgin
appeared in his sleep to a holy devout man, to whom she revealed it, and he
divulged it to others of authority in this Province; who determining forthwith
to try the truth of this vision, resolved to choose 16 men of credit, who to
that effect should go altogether to the city of Nazareth, as they did, carrying
with them the measure of this Church, and comparing it there with the
foundation, yet remaining, they found them wholly agreeable; and in a wall
thereby engraven that it had stood there, and had left the place; which done,
they presently returning back published the premises to be true, and from that
time forwards it has been certainly known that this Church was the chamber of
the blessed Virgin, to which Christians begun then, and have ever, since had
great devotion; for that in it daily she has done and does many and many
miracles. One Friar Paul de Silva, an Hermit of a great Sanctity, who lived in
a cottage near unto this church, to which daily he went to Mattens, said, that
from ten years space on the eight of September, two hours before day he saw a
light descend from heaven upon it, which he said was the blessed Virgin, who
there showed her self on the Feast of her Nativity: In confirmation of all
which, two virtuous men of the said city of Recanati, diverse times declared
unto me, Pref^ct of Terreman and Governor of the foresaid Church, as follows;
The one called Paul Renalduci a vouched that his grandfathers grandfathers saw
when the Angels brought it over Sea, and placed it in the forementioned wood,
and had often visited it there: The other called Francis Prior, in the like
sort affirms that his grandfather being a hundredth and twenty years old, had
also much frequented it in the same place, and for a further proof that he had
been there, he reported that his grandfathers grandfather, had a house near
unto it, wherein he dwelt; and that in his time it was carried by the Angels
from thence to the mountain of the two Brothers, where they placed it as above
said.

This is the true Copy in english as it is ingraved in the Church of Loreto.
And now this place is become a city having a Bishop and a Governor, and it does
exceed most Churches in the World for riches and wealth.

The Instruction of the voyage to Jerusalem.
HAving promised before, to every one that desires to make this voyage, or at
least understand it; it is as follows. First of all he that will undergo it,
must dispose of himself in that manner, that his final end be, wholly to visit
and contemplate those most holy places, wherein our Savior Jesus Christ lived
and dyed, desiring through his merits, that he may obtain remission of his
sins, and let him not go with intention to see the world, or for any ambition
or boasting of himself, or to say, I have been, I have seen, (and so forth)
only to be esteemed amongst men, as many does, with and nunc receperunt
mercedem suam, similiter. Therefore let him so dispose of himself, as that he
may freely and truly forgive all i^juries, restore to other men their due, and
live in the fear of God; for without this first and holy resolution, all man's
purpose will be but in vain. Secondly, let him dispose of his own worldly
affairs so, as if it should please God to call him out of this misera^le world,
that no part of a Christian be wanting in him. Thirdly, let him carry two
purses with him, one well filled with Patience; and the other, two hundred
Crowns in it, or at least 150. ( viz. one hundred for the voyage, for it will
cost every man so much, that has regard of his life and welfare; the other
fifty Crowns are to keep him in sickness, or if any other misfortune may
befall him. Fourthly, let him carry with him a warm suit of clothes, to wear
at his return in winter; likewise good store of shirts to keep himself clean
from nastinesse and lice, with handkerchers, caps, drawers, towels and other
necessaries. Then let him go to Venice, for there he shall find the most
commodious passage of any city in the world, there being every year on
Assension day a Galliasse assigned only for the carrying of Pilgrims and
Tra^ellers thither; And although he shall find other ships that will carry him
cheaper, let him not abandon the Galliasse; for it will be more safe and secure
for him: then let him agree with the captain of the Gally, who will not demand
above sixty Crowns at the most of him, both for victuals carrying and
recarryi^g, excepting when he comes to shore, he must pay for his horshyer, and
the usual tribute to the Turks. Then let him make a little Tent to lie in,
buying a pallat to lie on, and other necessaries as he thinks sit. Also let him
carry two small barr^ls, one of wine, and another of water.

Likewise let him buy Lombards cheese, Sasages, Neats tongues, and other salt
meats of all sorts, white Biscuit, a small quantity of all sorts of sweet meats,
and above all, the sirrop of Violets, and green Ginger preserved, for these
will stand in great stead both by sea and land, with some preserve of Roses. In
the Gally, let him get his lodging as near as he can in the middle, for if he
have a weak head, there he will be less tossed, and have more air. And after
that he comes to land in Turkey, let him furnish himself with Eggs, Chickens
bread, sweet meats and fruits; for in this voyage he must not be niggard of his
purse. Let his apparel be decent and plain, and his purse somewhat free, with
small gifts, both to the officers of the Galleys, and his conductors by land:
likewise let him beware he make no dispute nor conference touching Religion,
and let him be careful he always keep himself in the midst of the Caravan of
Pilgrims, and let him change all his money into Venetian gold and silver at
Venice, before his departure thence, which coin and no other is passable: and
with the foresaid sum he may go and return to Venice (GOD willing) in the same
Gally.

Highways From LONDON, to the most remarkable Cities and Port-Towns of
ENGLAND.
INprimis, From London to York. London is a city and bishopric, it being the
Kings court; I need not speak of the beauty and riches thereof, it being not
inferior to any city in Christendom: only I will name some few remarkable
things for strangers to see; viz. The Tower of ^ondon, and Magazens therein,
with all sorts of munition for war well furnished. London Bridge is not to be
forgot. S. Paul's Church, and Westminster Abbey, where the bodies of the English
Kings and Nobility lies entombed. The Royal Exchange and the New are worthy of
observation. Christ-Church Hospital, and S. Thomas in Southwark are not to be
omitted: As also the Charter House, Gresham College, with Merchant-Taylors
Hall; and all the rest are worthy of beholding, both for magnificence, as for
the relief of all the distressed.

Whit^hall, S. Jame'ses house, York house, Somerset house, with all the houses
of the Nobility on the water side, are not inferior to many now in Christendom.
And the Government of the City for civility and quiet passing the streets day
and night, does exceed most cities in Europe.

things, which for brevity sake I omit; with the modern buildings of Brick
palaces and houses, and Inn's of Courts.

Majesty's, and thence you may go to Winsor, which is some 7 or 8 miles further.

world; which ^leet lies at Chattam, two miles from the city of Rochester: and
Dover Castle is worth the viewing; and thence you may go over seas to France.
Much more might have been said, but because of brevity sake I omit it.
