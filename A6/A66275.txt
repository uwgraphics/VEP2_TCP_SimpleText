By the King and Queen, A PROCLAMATION Concerning PASSES.
MARIE R.

WHereas by the Treaties concluded between Our Royal Uncle King Charles the
Second, and the Government of Algiers, the Tenth day of April, One thousand six
hundred eighty two, and the Fifth day of April, One thousand six hundred eighty
six, It is Agreed, That all Merchants Ships and other Vessels of Our Subjects
should be obliged to produce a Pass under the Hand and Seal of the Lord High
Admiral, or Commissioners for Executing that Office; And whereas of late
several Merchants Ships of Our Subjects having (as We are informed) neglected
to take such Passes on board them, have in their Voyages been Seized for want
of the same: We being desirous that none of Our Subjects hereafter may run into
the like Inconvenience by their Negligence and Remissness in a matter that so
much concerns them, Have thought fit, by and with the Advice of Our Privy
Council, to Issue this Our Royal Proclamation; And do hereby strictly Charge
and Command all Magistrates and Officers of the Customs in all and every the
Ports of Our Dominions, to give Notice thereof to all Our Loving Subjects
whatsoever therein concerned, and that they may have Passes for their several
Ships and Vessels, upon demanding them from Our Commissioners for Executing the
Office of Lord High Admiral, or Our High Admiral for the time being, according
to the Rules prescribed and used in granting the same.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Seventeenth Day of March, 1691/2. In the
Fourth Year of Our Reign. God save King William and Queen Mary.
