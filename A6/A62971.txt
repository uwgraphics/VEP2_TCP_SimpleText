Admiral Herbert's LETTER TO ALL Commanders of Ships and Seamen In His
Majesty's FLEET.
GENTLEMEN,
I Have little to add to what his Highness has expressed in general terms,
besides laying before you the dangerous way you are at the present in, where
Ruin or Infamy must inevitably attend you if you don't join with the PRINCE in
the Common Cause, for the Defense of your Religion and Liberties; for should it
please God, for the Sins of the English Nation, to suffer your Arms to prevail,
to what can you Victory serve you, but to enslave you deeper, and overthrow the
True Religion, in which you have lived, and your Fathers died? Of which, I beg
you, as a Friend, to consider the Consequences, and reflect on the Blot and
Infamy it will bring on you, not only now, but in all After-ages, That by your
means the Protestant Religion was destroyed, and your Country deprived of its
Ancient Liberties: and if it pleases God to bless the PRINCE's Endeavors with
Success, as I don't doubt but he will, consider then what their Condition must
be that oppose him in this so good a Design, where the greatest Favor they can
hope for, is their being suffered to end their days in Misery and Want,
detested and despised by all good men.

It is therefore, and for many more reasons too long to insert here, that I as
a true Englishman and your Friend, exhort you to join your Arms to the PRINCE
for the Defense of the Common Cause, the Protestant Religion, and the Liberties
of your Country; it is what I am well assured the major and best part of the
Army, as well as the Nation, will do so soon as convenience is offered. Prevent
them in so good an Action, whilst it is in your power; and make it appear, That
as the Kingdom has always depended on the Navy for its defense, so you will
yet go further by making it as much as in you lies, the Protection of her
Religion and Liberties; and then you may assure your selves of all Marks of
Favor and Honor suitable to the Merits of so good and glorious an Action.
After this I ought not to add so inconsiderable a thing, as that it will for
ever engage me to be in a most particular manner,

Your faithful Friend and humble Servant AR. HERBERT.
Aboard the Leyden in the Goree.
