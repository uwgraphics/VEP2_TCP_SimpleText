Papists, and Tender unto him or them the Declaration mentioned in the said Act;
and upon Refusal to Make and Subscribe the said Declaration, he or they should
Suffer as a Popis;h Recusant Convict. And whereas notwithstanding the said Act,
and s;everal other Acts of Parliament against Papists Resorting to the Cities
of London and Westminster and Places thereunto adjacent, We are Informed that
diverse Popish Recusants intending to Disturb the Peace and Safety of this Our
Kingdom, have lately Resorted to the said Cities and Places in great Numbers,
and thereby having the Opportunity to Meet, have taken great Boldness to
Consult and Prosecute diverse Mischievous and Treasonable Designs and Practices
against Us and Our Government: We have therefore thought fit (by the Advice of
Our Privy Council) to Issue this Our Royal Proclamation; And We do hereby
strictly Charge and Command all Papists and Reputed Papists Except
Merchant-Strangers, and such other Persons as in the said Act are Excepted) on,
or before the Ninth Day of this instant May, to Depart out of the said Cities,
and from all places within the Distance of Ten Miles of the same.

And We do hereby straightly Charge and Command the Lord Mayor of London, and
all Justices of the Peace of the Cities of London and Westminster, and Borough
of Southwark, and all Constables, and other Our Officers, and Ministers of
Justice within the said Cities and Places, that they do make strict Search and
Enquiry for, and with all Vigor Proceed against all and every Person or
Persons who shall be found within the said Cities of London and Westminster,
and within Ten Miles of the same, contrary to the Effect of the abovementioned
Acts, and the Purport of this Our Proclamatiom. And We further strictly Charge
and Command, That immediately after the said Ninth Day of May, the Constables,
Churchwardens, and other Officers within the said Cities and Places, do go from
House to House in their several Parishes, Hamlets, Constableries and Divisions
respectively, and there take an Account of the Names and Sirnames of all such
Persons as are Popish Recusants, or Reputed so to be, as well Householders as
Lodgers or Servants, and to carry a List of their Names to the two next
Justices of the Peace, who are hereby required to Send for, and Proceed against
them (Excepting always Merchant-Foreigners, Settled Housekeepers, and other
Persons in the said Acts Excepted) as aforesaid. And they the said Justices are
likewise Required, when they shall have received such List or Lists, to
Certify the same, together with their Proceedings thereupon, to Our Privy
