Mercurius Rusticus: OR, A Country Messenger. Informing diverse things worthy
to be taken notice of, for the furtherance of those proceedings which concern
the Public Peace and Safety.
BY your leave Gentlemen. When Seriousness takes not effect, perhaps Trifling
may. Every man has some toys in his head, and I (God help me) a great many;
One will now discover it self, which has itched in it ever since last night.
Mars had lately tired me with long Marches and Skirmishes; Jupiter cast so ill
aspects on me, that I could not be joviall; The Moon was in the Waine; Venus
retrogade; and because Apollo would not lend me his Fiddle, that the Influences
of Saturn might not oppress me with Melancholy, I complide with Mercury;
with whom having made a Rustic Progress, and understanding that you love
variety of News, I am bold to present you with such Gleanings as I have
gathered in the Country.

And though I am not so witty as my friend Britannicus, nor bring Relations so
worthy the Whetstone as Monsieur Aulicus, nor come so furnished as Master
Civicus, nor so supplide with Passages as the Weekly Intelligencer, nor so at
leisure to sum up all Occurrences as the Accomptant, nor so large in promises
as the Scout, the Informer, and therest of your diligent Mercuries, nor so
impudent as to aver that I present you with nothing but truth; yet I have
brought that which perhaps you may be, for once, as well contented to hear,
though they be but such gatherings as I had from the Mill, the Alehouse, the
Smiths-shop, or the Barbers: for, these are our Countrey-Exchanges, wherein we
talk of as many things with little good success as they do at Westminster;
and other-while also, to as ill, and to as good-purposes.

I hope you will not be so severe to expect Truth in every circumstance; for
all Mercuries having the Planet Mercury predominant at their Nativities,
cannot but retain a twang of Lying; Yet this I will assure you, that (though
it be not all exact literal truth which I present) here are no such downright
Lies as my other Cousin-Mercuries make no bones of; but only Rhetorical,
Metaphorical, Parabolicall, or Poetical Lies, insinuating that which may
prevent deceit, without purpose of deceiving any to their damage:

And these (if well considered) are no Lies,
But Truths-essential clothed in some disguize.
Out upon it, that Rhyme slipped from me before I was aware, and may discredit all
my Relations to some Readers, who know not, that Rhyme, Reason, and Truth too
are sometimes found together: But, lest like one or two of the forementioned
News-mongers I tire you with Prefaces and Preambles, trifling out more time
then my Intelligence will be worth, I proceed to the matter.

As I was setting pen to paper to prosecute my purpose, (...) was cast into me,
giving me very good assurance that the (...), Informations and Relations which
come weekly and daily abroad (except some few published by Authority) are for
the most part either Lies, Mistakes, Vanities, or Impertinencies multiplied and
patcht up out of each other, but to employ the Printer lest he should else
forget his Trade in this long Vacation from selling serious books. And
thereupon it has been (or may be) voted that they mis-lead more then they
rightly inform; And permission is, for that cause, granted to every Reader (Ex
officio) strictly to examine them that they may be censured as they deserve;
and even this Mercury is by the same Vote left liable to the like examination.

My first Intelligence shall be of that which has most need to be taken into
present consideration. It is assured me that seeing the Cavees (which is the
Gloucester title for Cavalleers) are newly fluttering into Bedforeshire and
toward Cambridge, that they may divert the Parliament Forces from pursuing
their late Victories at Hull and Horne-Castle; It will be good discretion for
them both to prevent that diversion, and the mischiefs which those Locusts and
Caterpillars may do in the Associated Counties (if they should commence in
that Universitie as they have done in the other) by sending speedily a strong
party thither, and withal to have an eye to the securing of the back-way to
London, lest while they have drawn us to look Northward, they wheel about
Southward, to attempt the obstruction of the Easterne-water-passage to this
City; which if my Mercury deceive me not, is the maine design of our
Adversaries, what way soever they seem to take.

It is reported out of Hamp-shire (and it may be believed) that Basing-house
has been so long permitted to be a receptacle for the Malignants of Kent,
Surrey, and Sussex, and a means for their secure passage to and from Abingdon,
Wallingford, and Oxford, that it is now become a Garrison of Papisticall Cavees
daily strengthened more and more with Ammunition, men and victuals. Thence we
hear likewise that Denington Castle near Newburie, and not far from Basing,
is now fortifying to be a strengthening thereunto; That Andover is possessed by
the Kings Forces to enlarge their Contributions; That a Tax of ninescore
pounds the week is imposed upon every Hundred near those places, to the
enriching of the Parliament Adversaries, to the disadvantage of our chief
City, and to the impoverishing of those parts of Hamp-shire, Bark-shire, and
Wilt-shire, who now begin to cry out by reason of their oppressions, and to
curse the Malignancie and Neutrality of those who allured them to take such
serpents into their bosoms: yea some among them protest with tears (where
they dare complain) that if now the Parliament would send to deliver them,
they should find many hands to help forward the work; which their neighbors
also would be glad to further before they come under the same lash: and it is
much wondered that a place so near London upon a passage thither so convenient,
and so easy to have been cleared, should have been left so long obstructed to
the Parliaments great disadvantage, unless it had been unheeded and neglected
for the nonce.

I have heard from his own servants that the Marquess of Winchester, a very
dangerous Papist, (because once a Protestant, and perverted by a woman) and who
is owner of Basing-house, and now resident therein; has a Commission to be
General of the Forces raised and to be raised in those South-parts; and when
his Ladies Fathers Country men are come thither from Bristol and Westchester to
assist him, you shall see how needful it would have been to have settled ere
this time the Association of Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire, which I hear
say is now again revived, and as my Mercury persuades me may yet be
undertaken with good success, and for the prevention of the mischief
designed, if it be proceeded in with speed and courage, and be not by them made
fruitless, who were no good friends to it heretofore. But it is probably
suspected that some will directly hinder it if they can; or, by pretending the
promotion of it take occasion to diminish our strength some other way, under
color of saving charges, which (considering the chances of War are uncertain)
may so fall out, that it may be the breaking of the Associated Forces, the
loss of some part of the Country for the time, or the indangering of all; and
therefore it is desired by the well-affected in those Counties; that deluding
Propositions tending to such purposes may be well observed by the Associaters
in their meetings and discreetly prevented.

And now I think on it, the mention of this Association brings to mind somewhat
which a soldier in one of those Counties made me acquainted withal of his
opinion touching the same, which I will here insert, because perchance some may
advise worse. If it be not worth heeding, it shall cost but the reading; If it
be considerable, the benefit of it may by this means be taken, though he
should not be called to counsel in that Association, His opinion was briefly
thus, and these are his own words.

First, that considering the present necessity, there should be no delay in
establishing that Association, lest they who diligently meet, and talk much
that nothing may be concluded, lose that opportunity which is yet remaining,
and must be suddenly caught. Secondly, before the main work shall be completely
resolved on, (which will require more time) he would that those Forces which
are in readiness in those four Counties (reserving a small power to watch
over the Malignants in Kent and Suffex) should immediately march to Farnham
Castle, making that their Rendevouz and place of refuge to retreat unto when
any unequal power should march against them, as also to be a refreshing place
for the weak and tired, and a Nurserie out of which the Association should be
still supplied with disciplined men.

At Farnham he would not have them stay longer then for a days rest, or so
long as the ordering of other pertinent affairs might require and that then
they should remove to Odiham or Alton in Hamsheire (the furthest not being much
above two hours march) there to setle or move up and down to live upon those
that must maintain the enemies garrison at Basing; and to gather from them
their impositions so far into the country as they may adventure till the
assotiated body is completed, that (as usually we have done) we put not the
State to as much charge during the time of preparations, as would with good
husbandry bear the expenses of the whole expedition. As they grew stronger he
would have them daily march farther even to the walls of the adversaries
garrisons, laboring continually by their scouts, or by hiring the country
people, or insinuating with them, to gain intelligence of such things as might
conduce to their own security and the disadvantage of the foe, every day so
visiting some or other of the neighboring villages that their adversaries
might be furnished with no considerable aids or supplies. By which means, and
by that time the body of the assotiated forces were completed, the foxes of
those burroughes would be much straightened, and the southern parts of Hamshire
(seeing their inmates awed shall be won by fear or love to hasten their assent
and contributions to the said assotiation: and perhaps before the said
assotiation is fully settled (and during which interim many disadvantages may
else befall us) the enemies quarters being some and some gained, their garrison
may be taken, or well prepared for taking without a winter seige, which may
else lose us more men, money and time then we would willingly spare.

When the associated brigade is made up, he would not have it (as some have
proiected) kept in one or in several bodies in the several associated counties;
for that (as experience has taught us) would prove rather an oppression then a
defense unto them. But he rather advises that they should march into those
parts of Hamshire which either will not or dare not associate, leaving behind
them Kont, Surry, and Sussex as secured sufficiently by Farnham: garrison, by
the watch before mentioned to be set over them, and by that readiness which the
associated counties will be always in, to return upon any emergent occasion.

By this course they shall not grieve or burden their friends by being
continually billeted upon them, nor discourage or disable them in contributing
to their pay. Besides, they shall by making the seat of war without the
association, give the plough peaceable passage at home, disturb their
adversaries reicevers and confederates abroad, and daily enlarge their own
quarters. Yea by thus proceeding, the associators shall have means to augment
their forces (if there be cause) with less charge: for God assisting these
endeavors, the next bordering sheire will shortly petition to unite it self to
them to prevent being the seat of war, and so the next, and the next, till all
come in.

For that expedition he would have scouts, intelligencers, and spies chosen out
by good advise from among the stoutest and most witty of the well-affected, who
are of quality for such an employment, and would have them punished and
disgraced for their falsehood, and rewarded for diligence, and considerable
services according to their merrits, that encouragements from others as well as
their own consciences and interests might make them endeavor the more. For
these are the nimble and sure hinges upon which their forces must move forward
and backward, shut and open, as there is cause: And it is through want of these
that we have been so lame in our late executions. None of these should be a
common Trooper or Dragoneer, but men set apart merely for that service, because
we can neither confidently rely on men casually set forth; neither can they or
their horses perform such services as they ought to do, who are tired with
other duties, and brought off and on, at adventure upon a sudden.

And were he to select a Brigade of such a number as the associators have
resolved on, which (as he hears) shall be 1200 horse, and 800 dragoneers, he
should choose rather 800 horse, and 1200 dragoners, for that service, because
horse are not only a greater charge and more hardly raised but less
serviceable, and in some places and cases not serviceable at all, yea perhaps
800 horse, 800 dragoneers, and 400 musketeers may do better service then they,
if in lieu of charge saved by that change, so much might be added in engines to
secure a passage in galtrapes, swedes feathers, shovels, spades and pilteaxes,
which three last mentioned (though now slighted) are the security of Armies and
such as the most famous. Soldiers of the world made great use of.

He mentioned somewhat also of having a certain number of fire locks in steed
of muskets for night services, Ambuscadoes and other such like occasions
pertinent to the same design, and of many other things, of which some are not
to be revealed until there be opportunity to put them in execution, and the
rest are over-many to be recited here. Of this or of some other good course to
be seriously prosecuted for the strengthening of our hands the Country people
desire to hear, for though an evil spirit has long deluded them, now their
eyes begin to be opened, and they do see that the King, by the contribution and
personal aid of Papists from abroad, by arming Papists, Delinquents,
oppressors of the people, and the most vicious of his Subjects at home (and by
calling hither the barbarous Irish Bapists after their murdering of nigh an
hundred and fifty thousand of his loyal Protestant Subjects in Ireland) and by
some other such proceedings) will be both his own destruction and theirs if
they come not in speedily to help the Lord against the mighty oppositions and
machinations of those instruments of Antichrist.

We have had lately complaineings almost out of every County, that the greatest
enemies and hinderers of settling the Militia in a fit posture for the public
safety, were and are some Deputy Lieutenants, and such as are authorized to
order the same; and that none meet more frequently nor seem to employ
themselves more zealously in that business then some of them that are most
mischievous thereunto yet, this is no disparagement to those who are sincerely
active therein, because there is not one of these hypocrites in any county but
he is discovered, and by some passage or other observed to be what he is,
though to the general damage he still (...) questioned, questioned, and
continues i^ employments enabling him to do new mischieves every day for the
punishment of our sins: and if any of them be now in presence while this is
reading he may be soon discovered if you will but observe his looks and
words; for they will evidently show that his worships coppihold (as we say in
the Country) is touched by this relation.

I have received the like rural complaints against some Officers Committees
for the sequestrations and the twentieth part, etc. and many of them are true
in my own knowledge, it is said that some of them countenance the malignants
against the best affected, and most befriend the Parliament enemies in all
hearings, assessments, services, and contributions; That no men are more
gracious with them, then such as have most slighted and vilified the
Parliament; That some of them are frequent and familiar visitants of those
prisoners which were committed for taking arms against the State: That they
have counseled, abetted, and assisted them (to the abuse of the Parliament
Ordinances and Orders) even against those faithful servants to the King and
Parliament whose houses they unmercifully plundered; and it is probably
conjectured that many of them who have broken prison were by some of these
Committees or their instruments assisted in* or toward their escapes.

It is certified also, that they are more zealous of their own interests, and
pleasing their friends and acquaintance, then of the public honor, profit, or
safety; That some of them make use of those employments to satisfy their
avarice some their ambition, some their pride, some their lust, some their
revenge; and that it some other there is neither pity, justice or conscience
it is therefore verily believed in the Country that for our sins, and by the
sins of th^se our miseries are prolonged, and that if these had been delig^^^
and faithful in the execution of their trust, money had come better in and the
Soldiers pay had not been so long deferred to the hazard of the kingdoms
safety* yea so many good designs had not miscarried or been so slowly proceeded
in, to the dishonor of the Parliament, the discouragement of her supporters,
and to the strengthening of the enemies thereof. There is a petition exhibited
some-where, by many Freeholders to desire both houses seriously to confider
the dangerousnes of such men and their practices, and to take order concerning
them; or if they cannot, sire that God would.

I have heard lately from every part of the kingdom a general applause of his
Excellence the Earl of Essex, as well for many other virtues, as for his
valiant and discreet managing of the late expedition to Gloucester, and the
battails at Alborne and near Newberie, and am apt to believe the truth of it,
in regard I have been an eyewitness and an observer of his worth in those and
many other evidences of the same, yet I have no assurance either from City,
Court, or) Country, that an honorable opinion shall be long continued of his
or any other man's Heroic Virtues among the Vulgar, for they will be ready to
sacrifice him to morrow, to whom they sacrificed yesterday; and be ready to
vilify him upon one improbable suspicion; of whose worthiness they have had a
thousand undeniable proofs.

We hear from every quarter of the Country that the Kingdom is crucified
between the two Armies, like Christ between two thieves; for though one of them
be good in respect of the other, yet sure I am they are both thieves. Some are
discontented that the Army is quartered so near to the City, and fear they
will be more weakened by idleness, then they were by action; and verily believe
that it would be more both for their health and Accommodation, if they were
farther off, and where they might more straiten the enemies quarters, and
enlarge the limits of Contribution to their own maintenance, which (no doubt)
our prudent General will take care of when opportunity serves.

We are certified from Reading that it is re-possest by the Cavees, and that
they make haste to fortify the same, whereupon the opinion of the Country is
this, that when places of such consequence are gotten with much expense of money
and blood, it were good discretion for preventing further loss and charge to
secure them better when we have them; and it is thought that many citizens and
others will be shortly of the same opinion; yet Mercury holds it a point of
good discretion also not to censure harshly of what was left undone, or might
have been better ordered in their judgments; for they that are Actors find
more difficulties then the lookers on, and many times for our sins, the Divine
Providence does permit (to humble us) many failings and oversights in our
actions, which else our understanding might have foreseen and prevented.

It is voiced from the North, that the Scots have entered Northumberland with a
very great Army, and that the Cavees doubting their ability to resist, have
projected by slanderous detractions, and by seeking to raise jelousies, and
beget divisions between the Nations, to weaken their hands, and make void, if
it be possible, the intended effect of their Expedition: And therefore it was
advised by a plain Country-fellow, that to make such malicious plots and
endeavors unsuccessefull, we should believe of them as we find, and hope of
their sincere dealing with us according to their Christian profession, and
their noble and honest demeanor in their last Expedition, at which time their
Army was an Exemplarie Pattern both to us and other Nations of that Civility
and Justice which ought to be in Soldiers and Commanders professing Christ. He
is liable to a severe judgment that mis-judgeth his brother; but doubtless he
exposes himself to a greater condemnation that judges scandalously of a
whole Nation, and the honesty and faithfulness of such a one is justly to be
suspected.

Now to prevent the murmurings of those seeming to be on the Parliament side,
who grumble at the money which they are to receive from us toward their
Expedition to New-eastle, the honest country people hold it good counsel to
put these murmurers in mind, First, how cold this winter may prove, and perhaps
the next also, if the Collieries there be not set open to us, before a passage
be made thither by Forces from this place. Secondly, how much it concerns us to
have the Scots engaged with us in our Cause, as now they are: And lastly, that
the money wherewith by Gods help they may finish that work is not probably so
much as would be required to raise, carry thither, and bring back an Army sent
from us to that purpose, though it should cost nothing during their abode there.

There is cause of hope that by means of the New-great-soale which is now
coming forth, Justice will have her course more freely then of late, and many
mischievous designs of the Kings ill Counselors will be prevented. If it had
power also to conjure down the spirit of Malignancie which is raised in these I
lands, and take away Faction, hypocrisy, self-love, and discord from among us,
it were a qualification which I fear it has not; yet perhaps it may be a
means to further those proceedings which will much hinder their evil effects
for the present, and abate, at least, the predominancie of those vices ere long.

We are incredibly informed from Oxford, that the King had no considerable
losle at the skirmish by Alborne, or at the battle near Newberie, as we have
been made believe. It is true indeed, that he lost many Men and Subjects; but
they are but trifles, and it is almost generally supposed (though hoped
otherwise by me) things which he regards not. He lost also many good horses, as
his own party does confess; but he had them only for taking up, and has
takers enough to recrute them: He lost Lords, and a great Officer, etc. but
that is a loss the least worth notice of all the rest, for they are toys,
which if he please he can make of the veryest rascals in his Army; they did well
therefore to give God thanks that their losses were no greater: But had they
been so great on our side, we should rather have addressed our selves unto him
by way of humiliation, then have mocked him with a counterfeit Thanksgiving, as
they have often done, and may now do again for their late overthrows in
Lincolnshire and at Hull.

It is further certified from Oxford, or else Mercury deviz'd it, (which is
very probable) that the Archbishop of Canterbury (hohourable in nothing but
in this, that he will be the occasion of rooting out the Prelacie from this
Kingdom) has made a motion that Prince Rupert (who was there Incorporated and
made Master of Arts, when that little good Bishop (then dreaming not of such a
change) entertained him and His Majesty) might proceed Doctor, to make him the
more capable of a Bishopric, which it is presumed the Papists will procure the
Popes Holiness to confer upon him for his good services in their Cause at his
return, I know not-whither; for habitation he has none, and that makes him so
mischievous to those that have.

It is, there, thought also by some of His Majesty's servants (as our Mercury
verily believes) that the Queen will not have so many Masks at Christmas and
Shrovetide this year as she was wont to have other years heretofore; because
Inigo Jones cannot conveniently make such-Heavens and Paradises at Oxford as he
did at White Hall; and because the Poets are dead, beggered, or run away, who
were wont in their Masks to make Gods and Goddesses of them, and shamefully to
flatter them with Attributes neither fitting to be ascribed or accepted of; and
some are of opinion, that this is one of the innumerable vanities which has
made them and us become so miserable at this day. We hear not yet any
particulars of the late Ambassadors entertainment at Oxford, but wagers may be
laid that he shall hear there many lying vaunts of their valorous
achievements, and untrue allegations against the Parl. for what will not they
aver in private discourses, who are not ashamed to belie them in public, and
to their face?

We are informed of many strange Sermons preached every Lords day at Court,
some tending to P^perie, some to Tyranny, or to the encouragement of their
Auditors to a furious prosecution of this unnatural War. And we hear of as
many preached in other places to as ill purposes another way: Insomuch that the
well-affected Country people are persuaded, that if God had not by the
Parliaments wisdom and their exemplarie loyalty caused those false Prophets to
dissemble their secret desires, many of them (if they have not done it already)
would have preached Treason, and animated to that Rebellion whereof we are
falsely accused, by the promoters of Tyranny, because we will not desert the
reality of Allegiance to profess and practice the bare complements thereof to
the destruction both of our Liege Lord, His Kingdoms, and our selves. Other
Doctrines are also vented among us by some pretending to Reformation, which all
the Reformed Churches would be loath to own; and which will prolong our
miseries, if the Parliament and Synod (with whom they in some things comply
for their present security) do not (as we hope they will) timely discover and
prevent their increasing Heresies and false Maxims.

There was lately a meeting at one of our Country Exchanges, where Mercury
being in the Chair, many particulars pertinent to the present affairs of the
time were put to the Question, but what is fit to be resolved or voted
thereupon, it is referred to your conscience who now shall read them. The
Questions put are these:

First, Whether the King being yet constant in the Protestant Religion, and
real according to all his Protestations made before God and Man touching this
Church and State, the prevalencie of his Queen may not make him (contrary to
his present purpose) do for a woman's sake as much as Solomon; and the
flatteries and importunies of his young and evil counselors bring him to as
great a loss as Rhehoboams: whether also he may not be permitted to slip into
some failings for our sins (which drew down these judgments for our
chastisement) as it befell the Israelites for David's sin: And whether he may
not repent also as well as David, and be at last reconciled to God and us, to
the public advantage, and his increase of honor, when we have repented our
transgressions?

Secondly, The Queen having ^o many years after her first coming enjoyed the
love even of those of this Nation who are of a contrary Religion, might not
then have been won to become a Daughter (nay a nursing Mother) of this Church,
if she had not been left to their delusions, who (if it were possible) would
deceive the very Elect; If those who had place and opportunities to have
endeavored it and (as we hear) had inducements to hope it might have been
effected, had according to their duty attempted the same; And whether it is not
likely that the Archbishop of Canterbury and the whole Prelacie are now come
to this shame, because they complied with her seducers, and rather confirmed
her in an Idolatrous worship, then assayed to inform her in the right way?

Thirdly, Whether it be possible that a King, many years honored with
evidences of Piety and Morality, could possibly proceed as he has done, if the
falsehood and impiety of his evil counselors were not veiled over with some
disguises: And whether (though he make use of them for the present necessities)
he can esteem them in his private judgment bettep then Traitors or base
Parasites, who having been at first Zelots for the Parliament, afterward left
it for the wages of Ambition: Or whether he can esteem of those, more then of
a dog deserving the halter, who being first raised by His Royal favor, (and
long maintained by Projects and Monopolies obtained by abusing that Royal
Power) could desert their Advancer, and comply with the Parliament to avoid
their censures; and afterward again, when they saw the Parliament eclipsed,
could basely creep and insinuate back into his Bosom whom they had forsaken?

Fourthly, Protestants and Papists being so exasperated against each other, and
the Papists having begun a bloody Massacre in Ireland, which the Tenets of
their Religion bind them to prosecute upon all advantages) whether can they
ever be so reconciled as to live securely together again in these Islands so
long as they continue of different Religions? And whether they will think the
King out of their debt until he has given them leave to prop^gate their
Religion at their pleasure, and means to secure it in this Kingdom, by power
put into their hands: And if he should so do whether Truth and Peace were
then likely to be settled in these Kingdoms?

Fifthly, Whether his Majesty be not, by reason, discharged from all obligations
to the Papists for personal services and contributions to this war, and bound
in justice to punish rather then reward them for the same, seeing he cannot but
know, both by their tenets, and by those motives whereby the Queen encouraged
them in her letters, that they aided him for n^ respect to himself (if he be
not totally theirs) but merely for their own ends; and to continue that
barbarous and murtherous project which they long since begun here; lately
revived in Ireland, and do now prosecute throughout his Majesty's dominions,
for the accomplishment of our general premeditated destruction, under the
false color of serving his Majesty, and promoting his Privileges?

The last Question of theirs which I will trouble you withal is, If we suffer
the policies of Antichrist, for the continuation of his mystery of iniquity
thus to divide the body from the head, the King from the Parliament, the Court
from the City, the City from the Country, the Nobles from the Commons, the
Commons from themselves; yea to divide the Church, the State, every Province,
every County, every City, every Village, every Family, and many individual
persons in their own judgments, whether this be not or will not be shortly
such a divided kingdom as cannot long stand without Gods miraculous aid and
our more serious working with him? And whether will not the children of Babel
seek to repair again her decays by the ruins of our British Churches? And
whether it be not required of us, (and high time for us) to be reconciled to
God and to each other, that we may hasten the fullfilling of his decree
concerning the where, the malignant City, the false Prophet, the Beast; and do
that to them which they purpose to us (and have already begun to do in Ireland
with unexampled cruelty) even to beat or banish them, who will not forsake
their abominations, out of these Islands; that Babylon may vanish, and the new
Jerusalem come down amongst us? How these questions are to be voted upon, let
every one consider and resolve by himself according to his discretion.

Perchance there be some who are desirous to here what opinion we have in the
Country touching the national covenant lately tendered, and perhaps also the
knowledge thereof may be to some purpose. You shall hereby understand
therefore, that not only all men well affected to the Parliament, but every
other reasonable man also in these Counties, where this Mercury has been,
thus conceives of the said Covenant.

First, That it tends to the strengthening of that national union which is now
made betwixt us and the Scots, and the want of which was an occasion of much
bloodshed in this Island many ages together.

Secondly, That it conduces to that unity and conformity throughout all the
reformed Churches, which may by Gods blessing, settle Christian peace, prevent
the future increase of heresies and schisms hitherto multiplied amongst us,
help to preserve truth in purity against the encroachments of popery and
superstition, and further the overthrowes of Antichrist. Fourthly, That it will
help secure unto us our just rights and privileges, with the preservation of
his Majesty's person, honor and lawful prerogatives, against Traitors,
Flatterers, Tirants and Oppressors. Fifthly, That it ingageth us to a speedy
repentance of those sins which have brought on us the present plagues; and to
the amendment of our lives also for the time to come. 6. They hold it agreeable
to the practice of the ancient Churches of God, who when such occasions were,
made covenants to the like effect by Divine approbation, as their covenants
recorded in holy writ may testify. And the opinion of those among them whose
judgment is not to be despised, is this; that whosoever wilfully refuses this
covenant, deserves to be reputed an enemy to all that is good, to be chastised
by all the miseries attending division and discord; and to be deprived of every
good effect which it may produce hereafter; for the present, to be denied the
use of those good things which they possess among us, and to be judged
unworthy to continue in this land, or to partake of this air, any longer.

Of the like opinion is this Mercury, who among many other observations in his
rustic preambulations had these two, which I thought not impertinently
divulged at this time: One is, that they who would seem to have the tenderest
consciences in this cause betwixt the King and Parliament, and who usually
color their opposing the Parliament by pretending a conscionable obedience to
all the Kings commands, are they (if we may judge them by their former
conversation and present course of life) who make little conscience of that, or
of any sin else. As if for making no conscience of breaking such laws as were
once written in their hearts, God had now justly infatuated their
understanding, and left them only such a conscience, as might bring deserved
chastisement on us, and confusion on themselves.

His other observation is, that the most violent pleaders against the
Parliament, and the most active malignants among us are only such as th^se.
Beggarly and ambitious Courtiers; Riotous and vicious Gentlemen; Broken
Citizens; drunken Inkeepers and Vintners, with their dependants, tapsters,
hostlers, chamberlains and drawers: Needy Popish or debauched Scholars,
seeking or possessing preferment by complying with superstion or prophanenes;
Luxurious Gallants and Gamesters; Fencers, Fiddlers and Players; Silly people
led according to the capacity, folly, or frenzy of their Kindred, Familiars,
Masters, Landlords, or of the neighboring Justices, or unsound Parliament
members malignantly affected; Good-fellowes and pot companions, who confirm
each other in their malignancy on the ale-bench, and wonderfully strengthen
their cause by drinking healths to Prince Rupert, and confusion to the
Parliament, while horrible oaths and imprecations are shot off, Libertines
that fear the change of Church discipline will abridge their pleasures;
Projecters, and Monopolizers whose livelihood is taken away, if injustice and
oppression may not continue; Papists, Atheists, Prelates and their, etc. yea it
is observed (though I would be loath to be author of it) that among those women
which are zelots of the Cavallerro way (which many of them favor for diverse
carnal respects) none are such pert and violent Oratresses for it, as they who
are either known, or justly suspected, to be little whorish. To these if you
add a wandering Prince or two, some Lords (and such Commanders as become these
Regiments) you have that mass, out of which you may marshall up that Army
which opposes our King and Parliament.

We are certified that some are much troubled to perceive so many men, who are
learned, seemingly honest, wise, religious and conscionable of the right way,
and of those things which tend to the glory of God, the peace of their country,
and the prevention of Antichristian designs, should now be questioned as
Apostatizers and fallers away from their first love and profession, in this
time of trial, and of our great need of their assistance, and exemplary
constancy. Therefore to comfort them, and strengthen their faiths, we do here
give notice of two observations that a Country man (who has heretofore rightly
conjectured things pertinent to these times) has lately made: one is an
assurance that this falling away of men, Starlike for their eminency, is no
strange or unexpected novelty, but a fulfilling in part of that mystical
prediction by which we were long since forewarned, that the Dragons tail
should draw down stars from Heaven; For there is nothing now left of that
Beast (in comparison of what he was) but the Tail. And (as Serpents usually do
when a mortal wound is received) the tail wriggles about so furiously that it
strikes down those from their spears, who, being but Meteors, eemed stars in
this lower heaven, the military kingdom of Christ on earth.

The other note is this; He has observed that all the marks by which the
Prophet David marked out his enemies, and the malicious enemies of God and his
Church from other sinners, are undoubtedly now found upon the adversaries of
this Church and State, confederated together in these kingdoms; whether you
have respect to their practices, their qual^ties, their purposes, or their
languages as would appear if I should here insert the several texts
expressing their tyrannies, their impudent wickedness, their haughtines, their
skoffes, their scorns, their insolences, their blood-thirstines, their
oppressions, their treachery, their blasphemy, their lyings, their cursings,
their slanders, their prepartions for war and hostile attempts when they are
in Treaties of Peace, their drunken songs, their impious and derisorie
Intergatories concerning our God, his promises, our trust, our hopes in him,
our fastings, our prayers, and other Christian duties, and such like. And I was
moved here to divulge this for glad tidings, That though for our chastisement
these may persecute and exercise our patience for a while, yet they shall at
last receive the portion, and come to the destruction prepared for such
offenders.

More of these things I could tell you out of the Country, but I have other
business. Here is more then I first intended, and more, I fear, then some of
you will either thank me for, or make a right use of. If ever you hear of me
in this kind again, (which I will not promise) it shall be but once more, as
occasion is offered; and, I will be Mercurius Sublimatus, at least above the
clouds; and then farewell.

FINIS.
