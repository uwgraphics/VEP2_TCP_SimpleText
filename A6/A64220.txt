THE WONDER OF A KINGDOM, Dedicated to the Iunto at Westminster.

Rascal Reformers, Snowie Devils,
Behold the period of your evils
Draws nigh, ere yet the dogged star
Cease to inflame the Hemisphere
You shall taste vengeance, and be sent
To hell for ample punishment:
Your blew-capt Brethren swear they will be
The whips shall yerk your treachery;
Your Navie's gone, your credit's lost,
Those are your foes, once lend you most
Your Sumpter horses of the City,
Cry Pox take this damned State-Committee:
Your Army moulders, and from all
Points of the compass comes your fall.
O strange! the Ballad-makers dare
To say, you Slaves and Traitors are,
The Fates are just that made you thus
Even to the Rusticks odious:
Hobnailes and clouted shoes it is you
Are the brave boys, the feat must do;
To your enraged fury we
Leave Treason and Disloyalty.
Printed in the Year. 1648.

The wonder of a Kingdom.
HArk! how loud the Citizens murmur! how rigidly the Countries complain! how
deeply the Seamen threaten! how resolutely the Scots resolve! how wretchedly
Fairfax and his Saints bemoane themselves! and how desperately the Junto at
Westminster engage, blaspheming their God, and cursing their King! what denotes
all this?

This shows great Charles not broken by his fall,
Nor must be hurried to his Funeral
Without resistance, since the peoples eyes
Are fixed all upon his second rise,
That conscience is not banished, law'gone post,
That yet Astraea harbors in our coast;
That the Egyptian States no Goshen have
No patent for to shield them from the grave,
But must wade to their Babell deep in blood,
Which from each quarter swells into a flood:
No passage for them to the Holy Land,
Because the Red Sea does divided stand,
If they would fly, the Sea must be their tomb
And bury them in Amphitrites womb;
Providence irresistible has decreed
They shall escape water on the Land to bleed;
This shows the fumes of bold ambition
Makes their souls reele and dash against a stone,
The Rocks of Charles his greatness splits the Knaves,
They sink, as if in the Agaean weaves:
This shows the City-Asse on whom does ride,
The two most cursed copartners, reason and pride,
Is tired with eating thistles and would feign
Feed at the Royal Manger once again.
This shows the Seamen now will steer aright,
And that the Saints against Colchester that fight,
Of storms and tempests have their bellies full,
Since Lucas sported with a fiery Bull.
This shows the Iunto are assigned to fall,
And dogs shall celebrate their funeral;
This uncouth change, but happy Fate to see,
May well the wonder of a Kingdom be.
Those shallow Sciolists, who like Materia prima, comprehend in their minds all
variety of impressions, willingly part with their Ideas; those Nomalists who
taught we erred except we went astray, now preach there can be no tranquillity
without Order and Discipline: those that had their hands chiefly in the setting
up of the Dagon of Presbytery, now put to their whole strength to break it to
pieces on the threshold of Ashod: those that were for a Parliament without a
King, are now on fire to have a King without a Parliament; those that
worshipped Democracy, now adore Monarchy; those that toare and rent the Book
of Common Prayer, now grow weary of praying, Ex tempore; those that termed the
Surplice the Whore of Babylons smock, now esteem it as the emblem of purity:
those that would fly from a Maypole adorned with Garlands as from the droppings
of an Alder-tree, now censure their own folly for condemning such indifferent
objects; those that taxed David of heresy for extolling the music of the
Church, now confess the Organs yield a heavenly melody, and inspire the mind
with celestial Rhapsodies, those that formerly esteemed it no less then the
highest Superstition, to kneel when they received the Sacrament of the Lords
Body, now will not deny, but there ought to be reverence given, as well
external as internal: those that divulged it for horrible sin to bow at the
name of their dear Savior, now will acknowledge, that is no more then is
requisite: those that before preached it impiety to sign Infants with the
seal of the Cross, and were of opinion that they might baptize them
themselves, even in their Chimney-corners, now cry out, that the Cross is the
Christians Badge, and that they have incurred the pains of hell for their
horrid profanation of that holy Sacrament, as even at this present, A Weaver
in London, whose name I shall not divulge, because I hope the man (if
desperation do not too much get the upper-hand) may yet be a faithful and
conformable member of the Church: this man a fiery Zealor of the
Anabaptisticall Sect, of great reverence and esteem amongst them as one of
their prime Prophets, whether out of a desire of glory, and to be of singular
estimation amongst those of his fraternity, or whether the Devil (which is
most probbable) forced him forwards to do an act which might confirm those
erring Sectaries in their erroneous principles, and so to noose them yet
faster: however it was, this fellow one night having invited at least 12. or
14. of those of his own tribe, whom he thought were the most simple, and would
the soonest be deluded with a falacy, to a supper, which they celebrated in an
upper room, after all his guests were all seated, and began to fall to their
meat, suddenly he begun to be in a wonderful ecstasy, he writhed his face,
roled his eyes, foamed at mouth, and seemed to be as one transported beyond
himself to the great terror and amazement of his simple friends whom he
beckned with hands (seeming) not able to speak signifying they should kneel
down to prayers the credulous coxcombs did so, trembling so extremely that
their knees knocked one against another, suddenly beneath them they heard a
rumbling terrible noise and withal many fatal shrieks and dreadful groans
which almost put them beside their w^ts, (as since they have confessed) their
hair stood an end on their heads and they looked each minute to be swallowed,
the noise still continued, when the Weaver seemed a little to recover himself,
after a while returning to his wanted temper he began to speak comfortably to
his aguish brethren, exhorting them not to be daunted, this knowing, that none
could come to any evil beneath his roof, he having no less then an whole
legion of Angels to wait upon him, and therefore he desired them to sit still
(if it were possible) untroubled, au^ he would presently make a discovery
according as God had revealed un- to him: all which his comfortable sayings
very little or nothing abated the fear of his quivering brethren, then he
proceeded to read a chapter, which he told them was of sufficient efficacy to
quell the fury of Devils and Serpents, after that he gave out a Psalm,
requesting them to sing after him, which allas they were altogether unable to
do, their jaws being almost torn in sunder by the hand of fear, at last
after a most solemn invocation he stooped down, and in the name of God made
inquiry, what Spirit or Angel of darkness it was; that caused that terrible
tumult, after which words the noise and yellings greatly increased, and then on
the sudden quite taken away, the murmuring sound of a drum was heard, the
Weaver still plying his demands, received this answer.

That the shade or Ghost of John Reinolds, that worthy man of God was come
beneath his roof, where he met with great opposition by diverse damned souls,
who enclosed him about with yelling noise whom he had now dissipated, they
being the souls of such and such (naming the party) who had been greatly
opposite against their way, and he was sent to tell him, that there was a great
persecution shortly to be expected, against which he ought to arm himself, as
also to advertize the whole Society, that it was the pleasure of the Lord that
they should fight for the maintenance of their religion, which was signified by
that drum, the noise whereof he heard; after this was said, the spirit
departed; the Weaver turning him about to his guests, began to say unto them,
brethren, you all see how acceptable my services are in the eyes of the Lord,
that he is pleased to signify his mind so largely unto me, all which you may
declare unto our brethren, as you shall have occasion? And so after some other
talk the man departed home, and the next day they declared the wondrous things
that had been and heard, which was occasioned thus, the Waver bound one of his
Servants, by an oath of secrecy never to reveal (though since he has broake
it) the stratagem, and with many gifts and fair promises hired him to place
himself at that hour of the night between the boards, and the sealing, taking
with him a cat whose legs he had tied together with sharp pricks between, who
upon his pulling of a string made a strange and horrid noise, with extremity of
pain etc. Upon the rumor of this miraculous Revelation, the Weaver grew
greatly to be esteemed of amongst those of his Society, till on a time his man
betrayed the secret, which yet those pestilent Sectaries seek to hide for their
credit sake, this fellow lately confessed of his own accord, that he has
baptized many children by the fire side, for which his conscience now so much
upbraids him, that he remains distraught, crying out he is damnd, he is damnd,
and must go to hell for ever and ever; I hope the Reader will pardon this large
digression, it being so pertinent to our discourse: I say this fellow finds how
wretchedly he has fooled himself even unto the brink of hell, and I hope he
may yet live to be a penitent convert; but to our matter, it is very strange and
wonderful to see how of late men's minds are come about, like mill horses; they
have gone round this seven years, and are now arrived at the same station
where first they set out.

How fast at first the Hidra Multitude,
Who neither are with wit, or sense indew'd;
Ran to their ruin, but let that fault die,
And ever perish in a Lethargy:
How are the Junto madded for to see
Their soon regained love to Loyalty!
This very thing strikes to their hearts more fear
Then thunder in the trembling Indians ear:
The people see their error, they not theirs,
Since peace and loyalty are their equal fears;
And to speak truth, having primarily placed the cause in Gods Almighty and
excellent providence, the Rebels have brought these calamities upon their
perjured pates by their own greedy desire of Dominion, by their palpable
treachery to his Majesty, and by their trampling upon, and squeezing the purses
both of Peers and people to enrich their own paivate coffers, they could not be
contented to keep their King in prison, contrary to all Laws both divine and
humane, except they also murdered him, they could not be contented to thrust
out all those their Fellow Members, that refused to join with them in their
treasonable, perfidious, disloyal, bloody barbarous and unparallelled
undertakings, unless they also sequestered their estates to a penny, exposing
them to all manner of wants and miseries, yea sometimes to such penury, that
they have been compelled to beg their means of life, they esteemed it not
sufficient to draw in the people by a State-trick, to gull them into rebellion
by fair and specious pretenses, and buzzing in their ears false and needless
jealousies, to the involving of them in a long and bloody war, unless they
also put bits in their mouths, and saddles on their backs, and getting astride
upon them to ride them to death, they could not be contented to have abrogated
all Law and equity, all judgment and justice, unless they also introducted all
manner of illegal Impositions corrupted all Courts of Judicature, perverted
the course of Justice, and left the people (in case of never so grievous an
outrage) without hope of any redress, til the resurrection.

It would astonish a man almost beyond belief, to cogitate from what an height
those bloody Rebels are fallen within the space almost of a month, in so little
a time to forfeit what they had got together for the space of 7. years with
infinite expense of blood and coin, is very strange and remarkable; yea such a
metamorphosis as could not have been wrought by any humane power, without Gods
immediate providence, those that were Masters of a Kingdom some days since,
are now great in nothing but there fears; the Navies revolted (as they call it)
or rather returned to the Allegiance they owe unto their King, that they sink
not in that sea of blood in which they swam to their hopes, during the long and
cruel war, now have quite deserted them and wait but an opportunity to show
their teeth, the generallitie of the Kingdom, who for many years looked upon
them as Gods, now behold them as Devils, their brethren who have all along,
kept a fair correspondency with them, and jointly prosecuted the war, now
are come against them with their swords in their hands, resolving to take
vengeance upon them as perfiddious Traitors, and traiterous miscreants, the
reasons and grounds of this wonderful change are these.

First, when they (being puffed up with pride and overweening thoughts) imagined
all was their own by sea, as well as by land, would needs new moddell the
Navy, put forth and put in whom they listed, issuing out all orders and
signing all their mandates in their own name (a villainy never attempted by
any but them, not so much as naming his Majesty's Person or Power, the Masters
Captains and Mariners of Ships took it in extreme dungeon now perceiving
their intents were in all things to make themselves a free state, first they
murmurred in private after they took sides, and lastly openly declared
themselves against the treachery of the Rebels, turned the Skippers boy
Rainsbro^ugh their mock admiral on shore set sail for Holand to proffer their
service to their true Admiral the Duke of York, protesting to live and die for
his Majesty, in which condition they now remain at present.

Secondly, the Citizens of London having a long season like Fools and Knaves
hazzarded their lives and drained their Estates, for defending and usurped
greatness perceiving now at last that they have but nourished Serpents in
their bosoms who vallew them no longer then they may prey upon them, and have
left them in the lurch without performance o^ the least thing they romised,
leaving them open to the outrages of a plundering bloody Sectarian Army, they
resolve no longer to be the protectors of such villainies, but to repent of what
they have done restrain their aid for the future, and to pull down the
aspiring Nimrods, from the top of their greatness.

With them the Kingdom do combine,
And all the Ellements do join:
Brave Citizens stand firm and we
Will soon restore his Majesty.
Shall Colchester alone win praise,
And shall not London share the baies?
Join hands and hearts, to pluck down those,
Are both the Kings, and Kingdoms foes;
And let the after Ages tell
We sank these Traitors into hell.
Even when with pride their souls did reel
Even when they grasped fortunes wheel;
Sink Traitors sink, for in your fall,
Our pressures have their funeral.
FINIS.
