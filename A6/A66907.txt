COme you learned Poets let us call
our Fathers and our Mothers,
For we will write Historical,
of (...) faithful Brothers.
Richard, Humphry, John and George
William once who had the charge
of brave King Charles and others.
After Wor^^ers off^ all day,
here is a true Relation,
How our King escapt away,
And who was the preservation,
Of his Sacred Majesty,
In his great necessity,
beyond all admiration.
He great Kingly acts did do^
With a brave intention.
Ventred Crown and Kingdoms too,
in one day for our Redemption,
But in this I Will not insist,
The books does make it manifest,
beyond my wits indention.
For when he perceived in fight,
the a^^ten ground did rout him,
Five and twenty miles that night
he (...) with all his Lords about him,
But it would have grieved your heart
For to have seen them all depart.
(...) sorrow was throughout them.
Though with grief and double fear,
they yet did hold together,
On the confines of Staffordshire,
but to go they knew not whether.
The conclusion in the end,
Earl Derby said he had a friend,
hard by and they would go thither.
Then to the place they all did go,
where the Earl intended,
But the people did not know
from what blood they were descended
But they s^t them Bread and Cheese,
And the King did highly please,
his sorrow much amended.
The Earl of Derby in the end,
all his mint disbursed,
Asked if there was any friend
that wherein he might be trusted
William Pendrall then came in,
Who said he would be true to him,
else let him b^ accursed.
Ane further said ift 'twas the King,
nothing should be lacking,
In any part that lay in him
for the escap^ which he was making.
And like unto the Turtle-Dove,
This honest William ^ill did prove,
in all his undertaking^.

Richard he did round his hair,
For true Royallists they were,
all five were faithful to him.
Humphry fetched him Hat and Band.
of the Country Fashion,
Shipskin gloves for his white hand,
likewise John had great compassion
Fetched him shirt and shoes the while,
Then the King began to smile,
at his accommodation.
Richard fetched his coat by stealth,
and his best arrayment,
Then the King described himself,
of his rich and Princely Garment.
Nimbly he did put them on,
And a Wood Bill in his hand,
this was our Kings preferment.
William then went with the King.
Richard he did leave them,
Cause Intelligence he would bring,
least the ^ood it should decei^e them,
George and Humph^y scenting were,
Seei^g if the coasts were clear
none might come aneere them,

Hearing it was a thousand pound

The Kin^ was something then dismayed,
To think what b^its the Jews had laid,
and (...) P^ots were making.
All the day they w(...)ed then,
in great consultation,
Like forlorn distressed (...),

And said he know a hollow Oak,

With brakes and briars leave and bows,
that in number they ab^^nded,
It was the Castle of our King,
And his Royal Court within,
for ever is renowned,
William he did bring him food,
like he were a ranger,
While he staid within the Wood,
though ^ood King he was a stranger:
Hol^ow Oaks his dwelling place,
Where he staid for five days space,
in sorrow and in danger.
At last he came to the Lady Lane,
being all dis^^^sed,
And to her expressed his name,
the ^ood Lady then advised,
And appointed out a day,
When they both might come away,
and never be surprised.

The King which they had in their charg
on the eighth day of September,
The King he leave then took of them,
And said if ever he came again,
their lotes he would remember.
