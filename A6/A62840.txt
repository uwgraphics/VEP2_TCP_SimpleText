TO THE READER.
THE Glorious Occasion upon which these Odes were written, viz. His Majesty's
Birthday, and the New Year, accompanied with the Consummation of an Honorable
PEACE, required the utmost Liberties of Poetry; but I was Confined (for the
Present) to such Measures and Compass as the Musical Performance would admit;
upon which Consideration the Reader's favorable allowance is requested, by

His Humble Servant, N. T.

THE ODE UPON His Majesty's Birthday.
Set to Music by Dr. STAGGINS.

SUmmon to the cheerful Plain
The Graces and the Muses Train.
They come, they come, in pompous Throng,
And, as in State they march along,
This is the Burden of their Song:
Chorus.
Virtue is at last Regarded,
And the Hero's Toils Rewarded.
Hark how the Neighboring Nations round
To Britain's Echoed Mirth resound!
And various Languages employ
To speak the Universal Joy.
Let Winter Smile, the Fields be Gay,
Woods and Vales in Confort Sing,
Flowing Tides their Tribute bring
To Welcome Peace and Caesar's Day.
The Trumpet's Sound and Cannon's Roar,
No longer are the Voice of War;
Yet both shall speak, and both be heard as far
In Triumph now as in Alarms before.
In ancient Times of lawless Sway,
When Nations groaning lay,
Despairing all, and all Forlorn,
Then was the Great ALCIDES Born.
Such was Europe's late Distress,
When for the Suffering World's Repose,
With equal Courage and Success,
Our Second HERCULES arose.
O Favored both of Earth and Heaven!
To Thee, and only Thee, it is given
Rome's first Caesar's to outdo;
Our Julius and Augustus too.
War's dismal Scene is changed to Peace,
Yet shall not his Herculean Labors cease:
Nobler Wars he now will wage,
Against Infernal Powers engage,
And quell the Hydra-Vices of the Age.
Grand CHORUS.
So Glorious a Task does a Hero require,
Whom Valor and Virtue alike do Inspire:
It Is a Triumph reserved for the Just and the Brave,
Who Fights to give Freedom, and Conquers to Save.
FINIS.
THE ODE FOR NEW-YEAR'S-DAY, 1697/8.
Set to Music by Dr. BLOW.

Music now thy Charms display,
Let all thy Tuneful Sons appear,
To Entertain the Genial Day,
And kindly Treat the Infant-Year.
Young as it is, it brings along
Blessings on its tender Wing;
Blessings to requite your Song;
Blessings that forestal the SPRING.
Chorus.
The promised Year is now arrived,
That has the Golden Age revived.
The Prize our daring Warrior sought,
Is now completely gained;
Not poorly Begged, nor dearly Bought,
But Nobly, in the Field, obtained.
PEACE her self could boast no Charms
To draw our Hero from Alarms,
From glorious Danger -- till she came
In Honor's recommending Name,
And all the splendid Pomp of Fame.
BELLONA else had still been heard,
Thundering through the listed Plain;
EUROPE still, with restless Pain,
Had for her fearless Champion feared.
Harrass'd Nations, now at Rest,
Echo to each other's Joy,
Their Breath in grateful Songs employ,
For him who has their Griefs Redrest.
Chorus.] What then should Happy Britain do?
Blessed with the Gift and Giver too.
On Warlike Enterprises bent
To Foreign Fields the Hero went;
The Dreadful Part He there performed
Of Battles Fought, and Cities Stormed:
But now the Drum and Trumpet Cease,
And wished Success his Sword has Sheathed,
To Us returns, with Olive wreathed,
To practice here the Milder Arts of PEACE.
Grand CHORUS.
Happy, Happy, past Expressing,
Britain, if thou know thy Blessing;
Homebred Discord never Alarm Thee,
Other Mischief cannot Harm Thee.
Happy, if thou know thy Blessing.
Happy, Happy, past Expressing.
FINIS.
