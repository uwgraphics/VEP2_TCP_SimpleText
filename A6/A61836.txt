LONDON, Printd for PC and, TB 1642.

Master Strowd his Speech in Parliament on Tuesday the third of January 1642.
Master Speaker.
IT is the saying of the Wise man even of a King, Solomon the wisest of all
Kings that ever reigned in this earth, that in the countenance of the King is
life and death, like to the son which by the sending forth of his glorious
beams upon the fruits of the earth nourishes, and causes the same to
fructify and grow, gives vigor and strength to all the creatures that lives in
and upon the same, and by withdrawing his light being over shaddowed with
clouds keeps back the growing and flourishing of the creature, yea and by
continuance in that his hidden motion procures at last the utter withering and
perishing thereof.

His gracious Majesty, who is our son and comforter at such time as his
glorious beams of grace and favor reflect upon hi good Subjects, they
increase and grow entire and tender affection toward his Majesty, that no
distempers or troubles whatsoever can separate between him and them. But this
our son being over-shadowed with clouds, and mists of discontent and
disfavour toward his People, causes them to wander in obscurity and
darkness, even ready to faint and despair of any design they take in hand,
for the safety and security of his Majesty and his Kingdoms, yea and strikes
them as it were with death and utter destruction.

Master Speaker.

I persuade my self our gracious Sovereign in his own natural disposition,
is altogether bright and comfortable, and that never causes or retracts to
himself any discontent toward his loving Subjects, but by suggestion
information, and instigation, of malignant and disaffected spirrits, both to
the tranquillity and peace of his Majesty and the whole state of this Kingdom.

It is Master Speaker the only policy of desparate and evil minded persons,
that have been the only troublers of our Israel finding themselves in danger
(by calling of them to an account for their misdeeds and misdemeanors) to be
brought to punishment for the same, to cast aspersions upon those faithful
councillors of the King and State, which strive to prevent their malicious and
wicked designs, to overthrow and destroy the same.

It cannot Sir enter into my thoughts that ever his Maiest^e of him self could
have gone about to interrupt and hinder, the happy proseedings of th^s his
great and wise counsels whose endeaveours are altogether to maintain the
honor and, dignity, the peace and saftie of his Royal Majesty and his
Kingdoms, by removeing such impediments and hindrances as have hitherto
let the same and the establishing of true religion in this Church Congruent
to the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles set down and manifested in sacred
writ, by accuseing and impeaching the members thereof of high treason as if
they whose hearts are united to their lawful sovereign, and by nature bound
to the defense and security of their Contrie by Covenant with God tied to the
maintenance of his true religion should be the betrayers and destroyers of all
together.

These Articles Master Speaker exhibited against my self and the other
gentelmen are I conceive not really intended against us as if we were actually
guilty of the same but only to procure our absence from this honorable house
that we may not have our free votes in the trial of the 12. Bishops accused
by whom I verily believe were these Artickles drawn and only by their advice
and such as favor their cause were exhibited and I persuade my self, may we
be apprehended and taken from this house upon the same our Trial, will be by
force immediately, to cut us of although his Majesty no other-wise conceives
and is really minded we should legally be proceeded against, of such
powerfullnes, are those persons that were the Authors of them.

Master Speaker the Articles if actually guilty of are many of them, I
confess ^igh treason as to endeavor to subvert the fundamental laws to
introduce an Arbitrary form of government to the state actually to levi war
against the King to procure foreign aid to invade this Land and the like is
Treason I need not speak much to clear my self of these crimes I hope this
honorable house will make such a favorable construction of all my actions
since I have had the honor to sit in the same, that it will be manifest to
all the world that they have been far with out the compass of treason either
against my King or Country.

And Master Speaker if it shall be conceived by this honorable assembly, as
learnedly it has already been delivered by that w^^thy Gentleman that last
spoke, that as members of a Parliament, to agree with the same in all their
votes, for the punishment of delinquents, settling of religion, securing of
their own persons by a guard desiring assistance of our brethren in Scotland,
to suppress the rebellion in Ireland be Treason, then I think we are all
guilty of these Articles, otherwise are we cle^re and innocent of the same.

Master Speaker, I humbly desire of this honorable House, that I may have a
speedy trial upon the same, that as I shall be found guilty by the Judgment
of this high Court, I may know my sentence, which I shall willingly submit
unto; be it to my condemnation, or preservation, wishing and praying with all
my heart, that none of these evil and malicious designs in agitation against
the Parliament, by any malignant persons whatsoever may take effect to hinder
the blessed proceedings thereof, but that you may go one with courage and
cheerfulnes, to settle all things aright, both in Church and State, for the
government thereof in perpetual peace and tranquillity.

FINIS.
