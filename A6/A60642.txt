A MESSAGE FROM THE Spirit of Truth UNTO All the World.

Let all that pant, come; and all that thirst, come; and all that mourn, come:
for the Lord waits to show Mercy.

A Message from the Spirit of Truth unto all the World.
O Ye People, who have many Shepherds set over you, and many Teachers heaped up
amongst you, and yet lie scattered up and down as sheep without a shepherd, and
are driven from mountain to hill, where you neither get bread nor water; Have
you not heard some of them many years, and followed them many days, and yet
your souls want satisfaction? What is become of all your money that you spent
upon them, and to what purpose is all your labor in following them? are not
your burdens yet upon you? and do not your sins remain within you? and are you
not in the Land where famine pinches you? and does your faith persuade you that
there is no relief for you? Is darkness so thick that nothing can remove it?
are the chains thereof so strong that they cannot be broken? is sin so natural
that you cannot forsake it? are vain customs so prevalent that you cannot deny
them? are your eyes so shut that they cannot be opened? are your ears so
stopped that they cannot be made to hear? are your hearts so hardened that they
cannot be broken? are you so far alienated from God that you cannot be
converted? are you so much defiled that you cannot be cleansed and healed? Is
this the faith wherein ye stand? then woeful will it be in the end thereof; for
the end of this faith will not be salvation to your souls, but woe and eternal
misery: for with God all things are possible, and there is no want of power in
Christ to subject all the powers of darkness; but there is want of true love in
you to his Light and Power within you; and therefore it is that your sins
remain, and your burdens lie heavy upon you, that your eyes are not opened, nor
your ears unstopped, nor your hearts converted and healed; this is the ground
of your misery and the cause of your grief and trouble, because you hearken not
to the Word of Life, nor yield your selves to obey its counsel: How often has
God tendered his Love unto you, and how often has his Compassion broken
toward you? but how have you kicked against his Reproof, and have not
hearkened when he has spoken? and yet you say you want power to overcome
corruptions, and to get victory over sin; and because it is so with you,
therefore you are persuaded that there is no help for it in this life, but so
it must be whilst you live upon the Earth; Is not this your faith? and are you
like to get victory over sin, and to be eased of your burdens, whilst you give
way unto darkness that leads you into sin? and yet you say you strive as much
as you can to keep out of it, and feeling something in you that strives against
it, yet notwithstanding you feel it prevail over you, therefore you are
persuaded that it can never be otherwise whilst you are in the body, and so you
say the flesh is weak and subject to failings and haltings, and whilst you are
in the body sin will be creeping in, though you endeavor what you can against
it; and so it is; and therefore you must come to the Spirit of God in your
selves, that bears witness against the flesh, and testifies that the deeds
thereof are evil: for the flesh is weak, and in the flesh there dwells no good
thing; and whilst you live in the flesh you cannot resist the fleshly motions,
but will be captivated by them, and burdened with them; but the Spirit of God
in strong, and able to subdue the lusts of the flesh, and to mortify all your
corruptions, and to break down the body of sin and death, under which you lie
grovelling and bowed down in sorrow, pain and woe; for whilst the flesh lives,
and you live in it, and walk after it, you are under the Spirits condemnation;
for every motion of the flesh is contrary to the Spirit, and by the lustings of
the flesh the Spirit is quenched and greived; and here you cannot be free from
the Spirits reproof, nor the Judgment of it; for the Spirit condemns the lusts
of the flesh, and rises in Judgment against every motion of it; for being
contrary one to the other, there can be no agreement between them; and
therefore you may know that when you are reproved, you are joined to the flesh,
and obeying the motions of it; and there the Spirit strives with you, and
checks and reproves you, that you might not so swiftly run in the fleshly
liberty which increases your misery; and herein the love of God is commended
to you, in that he strives with you by his Spirit, to stop your way in which
you run after the motions of the flesh, and by his Spirit he calls unto you in
every reproof: and is there not that in you that lets you see that you should
not sin against God, and grieve him?

Object. If you say, Yea, but we know not how it can be otherwise; we strive
and endeavor as much as we can, but we are subject to failings, and though we
do see that we should not commit such things as sometimes we do, yet we want
power to resist and overcome them.

Answ. Now consider, Why is it that you want power to resist and overcome, Is
it not because you join not to the Spirit which makes the Evil manifest; for
when the Spirit lets you see that the motions of the flesh tempt you to evil,
then you are not to yield your selves to the motions of the flesh, but to the
motion of the Spirit, and so not to serve the flesh but the Spirit; for unto
which you yield your selves servants to obey, you are a servant to it; and by
yielding to the motions of the flesh, you are a servant to it; and there is
your failings and your sin committed; for in the flesh dwells no good thing, it
is the proness to evil; and whilst flesh lives, and you live in it, your
thoughts, words and deeds are evil continually; and though you may feel some
strivings against the Evil, and many times come under such Judgment that you
say, I will never do such things again, yet not joining with the Spirit to
overcome the evil, you want power to pay your vows unto God: And is it not a
sad thing that when you have sinned, and that Judgment overtakes you, and in
the sense of Judgment you promise never to do the like again, and yet do not
pay your vows unto God, but are found committing the same things again, and
that with as much greediness as ever? do you not here break your Vow, and sin
against the Spirit that makes you sensible that you should do so no more, and
so add sin to sin; first, by committing evil; secondly, by promising and not
performing?

Now seeing your own striving and endeavoring and promising does all fall
short of performing, and that you want power in your selves to overcome the
evil that is present, and so lie groaning under it, and burdened with it; and
whilst the flesh lives, and corruption stands, it cannot be otherwise;
therefore you must come to the Spirit, which is holy, which is harmless,
undefiled, and separate from sin, in which is no sin; and you must not quench
it and grieve it by disobedience, but unto every Repoof yield your selves, and
ponder seriously what it means. Art thou reproved by the Spirit? then stand
still and ponder it in thy heart, What does this mean? am I doing that which is
just and right, or am I amiss? and by standing still and pondering seriously
what is meant by the Reproof, thou will hear the express voice of the Spirit
tell thee that thou art in the evil, and thou must turn from it, and forsake
it, and deny thy self, and take up Cross: This is the Spirit's voice in thee,
and the Spirit is Truth. Now when thou find these things so, hearken
diligently to the Spirit, there is thy Teacher; and being willing to hear and
obey the Spirit, then thy soul will come to find life in the Spirit; and so
thou will begin to feel the Spirit's power, to draw thee, to lead thee, to
teach thee, to instruct thee, and to strengthen thee, by which thou will come
to know that thy strength is in the Spirit, and so thou coming to the Spirit
which has striven with thee, and yielding thy self to the drawings and
leadings of it, then thou will know the Spirit's work in its own power, and
wilt feel it strive over the motions of the flesh, and give thee strength to
overcome them; and so all thy own strivings and endeavors will come into
silence, by the power of the Spirit, and the Spirit will condemn sin in the
flesh, and manifest its own life in thy mortal body; and then thou will know,
That as sin has reigned unto death, even so Righteousness reigns unto life
by Jesus Christ; (Mark) here is an overcoming Righteousness reigns unto life by
Jesus Christ; and that which reigns is in dominion, it has overcome and got
the victory; and so it is the power of Christ that overcomes the wicked one in
thee; therefore join to the power of Christ in every Reproof, and thou will
find that whatsoever he does reprove in thee by his power, he will by the same
power crucify it for thee, and so redeem thee out of all iniquity,
transgression and sin, and set thee free from thy burdens with which thou art
oppressed; and here thou will feel Christ to do that, which thou could not
do for thy self, nor any other for thee; and then thou will know that the same
which reproves thee for sin, is thy Savior from it, and thy Redeemer out of
all iniquity; and as thou come unto him, and believe in him, he will not
cast thee off; therefore let not thy sins withhold thee from coming to Christ,
for thou art he that he seeks: And who has more need to come unto him than
thou have? it is thou that art diseased, it is thou that art sick, and
therefore thy need is greatest of a Physician, and thy wounds have most need of
cure, and what else can heal thee and cure thee, but Christ the power of God?
and therefore his compassion is toward thee; though thou art a sinner, he
would not have thee die and perish, but would have thee come to him that thou
might be healed and saved; for he comes to save the world, and not to
destroy it; and if thou die in thy sins, thy destruction is of thy self: For
Christ is not wanting in his love to manifest thy sins unto thee, and to
reprove thee; but if thou art rebellious against him, and wilt not come unto
him, then thou forsakest thy own mercies, and thereby destroyest thy self;
therefore mind the Light with a careful eye, and take heed unto it, and thou will see thy Salvation to be in it, and so know from whence thy Salvation
comes; and there will be thy stop and cross to thine own way, all thy hearts
lusts will be crossed, thy evil thoughts, words and deeds will be all stopped
and crossed by the Power of Christ; and it will mortify the flesh, and all the
deeds of it; and here thou will feel Christ to give thee power over the world,
the flesh and the Devil, and every motion of the flesh in its first rise thou will have strength in the power of Christ to beat it down and subdue it; and so
in the Power thou will know the daily Cross to thy will, to thy wisdom, to thy
reason, to thy corruptions, to thy vanities, to thy mirth, to thy pleasures, to
thy customs, to thy formalities, to thy traditions, to thy vain worship; and
whatsoever has its rise and being from the motions of the flesh, the Power of
Christ will cross that nature and destroy it, and so bring thee into death, and
all thy lovers with thee, and crucify all down together; and here thou will
feel the power strike over thy filthiness and thy own righteousness, and stain
the pride of the glory of flesh; then in the power thy change being wrought,
and thou coming into union and fellowship with the Power, thy strength will be
renewed in God, and his Commands will not be grievous to thee; for whatsoever
he does require of thee, he will give thee strength to perform it, and so thou will know that the same which requires, the same gives strength to perform
what is required; and how can thou then want strength and power, when thou
art joined to Christ the Power of God, who is greater and stronger than the
power of darkness? Will thou complain for want of strength, and want of power?
and will thou now say, I would do this or the other, but I cannot, I have no
strength, I have no power. Oh nay, if thou art come to Christ the Power of God,
thou will feel him to be greater in thee than he that is in the world, and by
faith in his Power thou will know that all things are possible: for if Christ
was not the greatest and strongest, the Creation could never be restored, nor
the soul redeemed out of the fall: but Christ is the greatest, and Christ is
the strongest; for he is the first and he is the last, therefore with him all
things are possible; and though in thy own eye some things may seem impossible,
yet with him it is possible, who works and none can let it: therefore
whatsoever weakness is upon thee, and that thou can not overcome those things
that do burden thee, Be not faithless but believe, and look to Christ who is
sufficient to help thee and relieve thee; for thy weakness is want of faith,
and so thou staggerest at the Promises and appearances of Christ; and if he
utter his voice within thee, and say unto thee, Turn unto me and live, thou
can not believe that it is he, and so the flesh vaileth thee, and imbondageth
thee by the secret working of the Mystery of Iniquity; for now people cry, How
are we in bondage to the things that! If I could tell what to do, I would never
go to the Worship that now is observed, it is such a bondage to me, and such a
burden upon me, that it makes me to mourn under it; but what shall I do, the
Law requires it, and I want strength to stand against it? I would willingly
deny it, if I could do it, and not come into sufferings; but I must either do
it, or else I shall bring my self into trouble.

Now consider, What is it that convinces thee that the present Worship is not
in the Truth? and what is it that is burdened with it, and would be free from
it? and what is it that reasons for safety and cannot deny it? Read this
distinction, and then thou will plainly see, that thou createst thy own
bondage, by giving way to thy own reason; for that which manifests the Worship
to be out of the Truth, that is the Light of Christ, and that which is
burdened with it that is the Righteous Seed of God; but that which reasons for
safety that is the flesh, and thou entering into conference with flesh and
blood, (...) go from Christ the Power of God, and so thou have neither
strength nor power to deny and separate from that which is the burden of the
Seed; and then thou seek out excuses in thy reason, and something will be
taking care for Wife, Children and Estate, and the things of this life, and
reason willbe ready to say, If I should deny and separate, I should be deprived
of my Liberty, and lose my Estate, and so become a sufferer; and I had better
undergo the burden, than expose my self to suffering; and though I do conform,
yet my mind not agreeing in performance, I hope it will not be charged upon me
as sin. Oh! take heed, for this is a greater danger, then the danger of
suffering, or loss of thy estate; for if thou by such reasoning think to save
thy own life, thou losest life eternal, and that will be a greater loss unto
thee then the loss of all things in this world; and therefore let not such
things prevail over thee, for they will imbondage thee, and cause thee to go
heavily, and if thou love any thing more than Christ, thou art not worthy of
him; therefore thou must deny all for him, and count nothing too dear to offer
up which he requires of thee, but let Husband and Wife go, and Children go, and
House and Land go, to follow Christ; and yet love thy Wife and Husband, and
Children in their places, and use thy House and Land in their places, for in
their places they are good and comfortable; but if they lie in thy way for
following Christ, and that thereby thou art hindered for answering his
requirings, then they are sad and miserable, and so they are to be denied, and
not otherwise: And here thou will find strength and power present with thee,
and wilt be made willing to deny and separate from that Worship which thou art
convinced is out of the Truth, and which is thy burden to observe: if thou
take heed to the Light and Power of Christ in thee, it will open thy eye to
look over a Prison or Estate, or the nearest things that are unto thee, it will
let thee see that which is beyond them all, a glorious Inheritance that never
fades away, a Kingdom that has no end; and therefore obey the Spirit of God in
thy own conscience, bow unto it, there is the true Worship, a Worship in the
Spirit, a Worship in the Truth; worship God there all ye that desire to serve
him.

And if you say, Thus we would do, but we want strength, and we want power to
do it.

Ans. Oh cast away all your reasons, and wait in simplicity, and the Spirit
will help you; therefore come to the Spirit whosoever thou art, and what
condition soever thou art in; if thy sins burden thee, come to the Spirit to
ease thee; if thy Worship burden thee, come to the Spirit for strength to deny
it, and then thou will have power over all thy reasonings, and all thy fears,
and all thy doubtings; for the Spirit will help thee in thy greatest straits;
it will be thy strength in weakness, it will comfort thee in feebleness, and
what is it that the Spirit will not do for thee, if thou love it and come unto
it? I tell thee from true experience, that it will do so much for thee, as thou
needst do nothing for thy self, but stand still and eye the movings of the
Spirit, and so yield thy self to its drawings and leadings, then it will save
thee from sin, and redeem thee out of iniquity; it will ease thee of thy
burdens, and set thee free in the liberty of its own life: and this is the work
of God's Spirit, which saves by its Grace, and therefore thy strength is to
stand still and believe in the Spirit, and in so doing thou will neither want
strength nor power to overcome whatsoever corruptions do imbondage thee, but
the Spirit will release thee, and give thee dominion to reign and rejoice over
thy enemies which have reigned and rejoiced over thee.

And now ye that are panting and hungring after the living Refreshment, come ye
also to the Spirit, that ye in the Spirit may be comforted; for God regards
your breathings, and your tenderness is before him: therefore be not ye afraid
to come, because ye are weak, and because ye are feeble, and because ye see
some failings, and so mourn at the sight of them, and judge your selves
unworthy to come; O let not these things discourage you, but come, though weak,
come, though feeble; come, though thou see some failings, it is the Spirit
must give thee strength, it is the Spirit must give thee comfort, it is the
Spirit must overcome thy failings; therefore come and delay not: and as thou
come unto it, then deny thy self and follow it, and let not thy eye look any
other way, nor to any other thing; so in the living Spirit thou will worship
the living God, who is a Spirit, and there thou will feel his presence, his
virtue and goodness, and that will answer thy breathings, and satisfy thy
hungrings; and through the nourishment of the Spirit thou will grow in the
Spirit, and live in the Spirit, and then there is no condemnation unto thee:
Therefore let every one come to the Spirit and be saved, for the Lord waits to
show mercy: He is pulling down the birth of the flesh, and raising up the birth
of his Seed; and he is dear and tender over it wheresoever it breathes, and
therefore to the babe he says, come; and to the poor and needy he says, come,
I will in no wise cast thee off: and as this is his voice to the babe of
Innocence, even so he says to the worker of Iniquity, Depart from me, I know
thee not. And here is a distinction in the Invitation; unto the true birth he
says, Come; unto the false birth he says, Depart: Therefore let the wicked
forsake his way, and the worker of iniquity depart from his iniquity; then let
the babe of Innocence draw nigh and come, for thou art the babe which is
tendered; and therefore come in the drawings of the Spirit, and drink of the
Water of Life freely; for the Fountain is open unto thee that thou may be
refreshed, nourished, and comforted in the power of an endless life, which has
compassion upon thee in mercy and loving kindness.

And now all people, hear the Spirits voice, obey its teachings, yield to its
drawings, and so come to the Church in the Spirit, the Ministry in the Spirit,
the Worship in the Spirit, the Unity in the Spirit, and so serve God in the
Spirit, in which there is no condemnation; and there the good Shepherd will
lead you, and his voice you will know from the voice of strangers, therefore
hearken and obey; This is your day, come; yea let it be now, and put it not off
to another time; for delays are dangerous, and by delays you may lose the time
that now is, and so lose your peace and happiness for ever: therefore let the
World go, Pleasures go, Will Worship go, and come to the Spirit, walk in the
Spirit, and live in the Spirit; then no division any more, but one heart, one
mind, and one soul, in one Seed of Life, which is blessed for ever, in which
the Saints have communion together, and in which true love, peace and concord
abounds; where there is no more twain, but one new man in Christ, who
reconcileth all things by himself, and so makes peace; unto whom all come,
that of his Life you may be born, without which ye can never enter into the
Kingdom: therefore come to Christ the saving health of all Nations, the chief
Shepherd and Bishop of the soul; whose pastures are fresh and green; whose
invitations are full of love; Oh let it win you, let it draw you and overcome
you, that by his Power ye may be saved, and by his Virtue ye may be healed, and
so inherit everlasting Life to your souls comfort, without which you can never
be happy, neither here nor hereafter; therefore consider it seriously, the
matter is weighty.

THE END.
