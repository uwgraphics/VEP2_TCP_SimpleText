The VINDICATION and DECLARATION of the Scots Nation, etc.
AN Aspersion being cast upon our Actions, and a Sandall raised against our
Proceedings. We conclude our selves engaged to wipe off the one, and beat down
the other by this short Vindication.

It is not unknown to the world, that at First we were Invited to assist the
Kingdom of England upon a Solemn Agreement, as well to make the late King
Glorious, as to preserve to Lawful Rights, and Liberties of the Subjects. The
only means to effect this, was propounded the forcible Rescuing the King from
His Evil, and bringing Him back to His Great Council, whom we were informed
He had [wilfully, and for no cause given by them] deserted: [Though now we are
fully satisfied of the contrary.]

This specious pretense involved us in that Engagement: in order to the
effecting whereof, our Army in 1644. Marched into England: The success which
their Design found thereby, we need not mention; it being acknowledged at
large by their own Papers.

Upon the Account also, after the Kings coming into our Army, we treated with
them, and upon their large protestations of acting nothing contrary to the
first agreement, [of the faithful performance whereof we alone were not
frustrated] we left his Majesty to be attended on by the Commissioners, of both
Houses of the Then Parliament of England, expecting thenceforth a speedy
performance of theirs and our Agreement, but how our expectation was therein
deceived we leave it to their own late proceedings to determine and declare.

After this, being informed how the Army of Sectaries behaved themselves
toward the King, we held our selves obliged by our said Solemn Engagement to
endeavor the Redress of his Majesty's sad condition, and to that end by
consent of Parliament we raised an Army in 1648. and gave them Order to March
into England: which was accordingly performed.

Upon their March we were informed of a Treaty to be between his then Majesty
and his two Houses, and were also possessed with this suggestion, that under
the countenance of that our engagement, the Malignant party had strengthened
themselves to hinder the happy effects of the said Treaty: of which we being
unwilling to be accounted the abstructers, we sent Orders to our General to
stay his further March, and forbear any engagement against the English, till
we were truly satisfied what effect the said Treaty would produce.

Our General accordingly made an Hault, not doubting but that the English had
done the same. But their Lieutenant General CromWell taking advantage of his
security, unexpectedly fell into our Generals quarters [ who suspected no such
treacherous fruits of a pretended Treaty, and had no order to engaste against
them] and before our General was or could be Resolved what to do, prosecuted
his Design with so hot and eager a pursuit, that by the advantage he had got
by that his treacherous first onset, he so dispersed our whole Army, that it
was no Labor for him totally to destroy the same, or have them all at his
Mercy [which in the conclusion proved but cruelty, witness our General
himself Whom they murdered in London after they had given him quarter.]

By this defeat he gained a free passage with his Army without opposition, to
March against this Kingdom. To prevent this, those of us who had protested
against that Engagement, and to their utmost power opposed it in Arms [ which
they never laid down, until the Garrisons of BERWICK and Carlisle were
restored to the Kingdom of England] These of us [we say] by a letter from the
House of Commons to the General Assembly of this Kirk of the third of August
1648. intimating With What hopeful success the Treaty was like to go on) were
invited to a Treaty with the said Lieu. General Cromwell authorized thereunto
by both Houses of Parliment: And this was accepted on both Parts.

At the meeting upon the 5. of October following Lieu. General Cromwell in the
Name of the Parliament of England, did represent to the Committee of Estarts of
this Kingdom, the wrongs and injuries committed against the Kingdom of
England in that Engagement, and thereupon did demand by way of satisfaction,
that they would give assurance in the name of the Kingdom of Scotland, not to
admit, or suffer any who have been Active in, or consenting to that Engagement,
to be employed in any Public place, or Trust whatsoever; which [the
exigencies of our affairs, as then necessitating us thereunto] was not only
granted, and afterward confirmed in Parliament, but also publicly disclaimed,
because we did expect a happy period of the abovementioned Treaty between His
Majesty, and His two Houses: but what effect that did produce is apparent to
the whole world in General, and to this Kingdom particularly, who are
concerned therein more especially; for thereby they conclude, themselves free
from whatsoever Relation, or mutual obligation to the Kingdom of England, and
bound equally by the Law of God, Nations, and Common Right to declare as
follows.

The DECLARATION of, etc.
SInce the hideous, and unparrallel'd proceedings of the Sectaries of England
especially of the Army [in reference to Religion, to the Law, to the protesting
against, and disanulling all the proceedings of the Treaty, to the Freedom of
both Houses, (one being declared useless, and many Members of the other kept
away by force, and the rest under the power of the Sword) to the taking away of
the Kings Life, and the changing the very Fundamental Government of that
Kingdome] since their proceedings [we say] have manifested themselves contrary,
and Diametrically opposite to all bonds of Religion, or but Moral Honesty,
Loyalty to the King, mutual amity and Friendship betwixt the two Kingdoms,
the Solemn League and Covenant, yea, and their own Protestations,
Declarations, Professions, and Remonstrances.

And since by such proceedings it is apparent, that there has been in England
a backsliding, and departure from those Grounds and Principles wherein the two
Kingdoms were engaged: we held our selves bound equally by the Law of God and
Nations to protest against them, and to address our selves according to the
Law of this Kingdom, to the Heir apparent of this Crown and Scepter, whom we
have not only acknowledged for our King, and with all readiness, unanimity,
alacrity, and solemnity proclaimed His Majesty by the name of CHARLES the
SECOND, of Great Britain, France and Ireland, etc. But also, [having now by
his last Express received such full satisfaction as both the General Assembly
of the Kirk, and Grand Committee of Estates did desire, or could be expected,
do DECLARE to the whole world, that we will receive His Majesty [when he shall
think fit to Honor us with, and encourage us by His Royal presence] with all
cheerfullnesse, and most willingly render unto Him that faithful subjection,
and dutiful obedience which can be expected from Loyal Subjects to so
Gracious a King, who, by granting so much, has so far endeared This Nation,
That we further DECLARE,

That we will contribute our utmost endeavors according to the Duty of
Faithful and Loyal Subjects, to settle his Majesty in the peaceable
Possession of the Government of his Kingdom of England, and other his
Majesty's Dominions, according to his Majesties' undoubted right of Succession,
and with all their Lives, Estates, Power, and Strength, assist his Majesty in
bringing to Justice the Actors and Abettors in that HORRID and UNPARRALED
MURDER of his Majesty's Royal Father, by which we doubt not but fully both to
satisfy the whole world how much we did and still do detest and abominate the
very design thereof, and also give a sufficient testimony of the integrity of
intentions toward MONARCHICAL Government and the continuance thereof in his
Majesty's Person and Posterity, and of our utter detestation of the unparaleld
practices of those Sectaries at West-minster, Derby-House, and in the Army, who
Design the Ruin of his Majesty and the Subversion of the ancient and
Fundamental Laws and Government of all his Three Kingdoms, whom therefore we
Resolve to our utmost hazard of our Lives, and Estates, to oppose: And to that
end do further DECLARE,

That we will not admit of any Treaty with any of his Majesty's Enemies (without
his consent nor) till all the Late proceedings in England since the ending of
the Treaty, between his late barbarously Murdered Majesty and his then Two
Houses of Parliament, be disclaimed and disavowed, and both Houses there be
permitted to sit in Freedom and safety, that so addresses may without fear
and danger of the Subjects lives, be made unto them concerning all matters of
just complaint.

And from these Resolutions and Declarations in the last place, as we DECLARE,
that as no alteration or revolution of affairs can absolve us, so we trust in
God that no success, whether good or bad, shall be able to divert us from that
course and means by which we have jointly and unanimously consented to assist
his Majesty according to this our present Declaration, and will pursue with all
alacrity till we have settled his Majesty according to his own Hearts desire,
attained the wished ends of the long continued Troubles of his Three Kingdoms,
and put a period to those unnatural Wars and divisions which have so long
wasted all his Dominions; That so at Length (if God be so pleased) we may live
a comfortable and quiet life under the shadow of so hopeful and Gracious a
Kings prosperous and happy Government. Which God of his infinite Mercy grant in
his good time That so the Throne of Charles the Second may be established in
righteousness, peace and Happiness.
