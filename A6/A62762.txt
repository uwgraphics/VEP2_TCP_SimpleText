TO THE KING'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY.
The Humble ADDRESS of the Prebyterian Ministers in His MAJESTY'S Kingdom of
SCOTLAND.
At Edinburgh the Twenty first day of July, in the Year 1687. May it please
your Majesty,
WE Your MAJESTY'S most Loyal Subjects, the Ministers of the Presbyterian
Persuasion in Your Ancient Kingdom of Scotland, from the deep Sense we have of
Your Majesty's gracious and surprising Favor, in not only putting a stop to
our long sad Sufferings for Nonconformity, but granting us the Liberty of the
public and peaceable Exercise or our Ministerial Function, without any hazard;
as we bless the Great GOD who has put this in Your Royal Heart, do withal find
our selves bound in Duty to offer our most humble and hearty Thanks to Your
Sacred Majesty; the Favor bestowed being to us, and all the People of our
Persuasion, valuable above all our earthly Comforts: Especially since we have
Ground from Your Majesty to believe, That our Loyalty is not to be questioned
upon the account of our being Presbyterians; who, as we have amidst all former
Temptations endeavored, so are firmly resolved still to preserve an entire
Loyalty in our Doctrine and Practice, (consonant to our known Principles, which
according to the Holy Scriptures, are contained in the Confession of Faith
generally owned by Presbyterians in all Your Majesty's Dominions:) And by the
help of God, so to demean our selves, as Your Majesty may find cause rather to
enlarge, than to diminish Your Favors toward us: Thoroughly persuading
ourselves, from Your Majesty's Justice and Goodness. That if we shall at any
time be otherwise represented, Your Majesty will not give Credit to such
Information, until You take due Cognition thereof: And humbly beseeching that
those who promote any Disloyal Principles and Practices, (as we do disown them)
may be looked upon as none of ours, whatsoever Name they may assume to
themselves.

May it please Your most Excellent Majesty, graciously to accept this our
humble Address, as proceeding from the Plainness and Sincerity of Loyal and
Thankful Hearts, much engaged by this Your Royal Favor, to continue our
fervent Prayers to the King of Kings, for Divine Illumination and Conduct, with
all other Blessings Spiritual and Temporal, ever to attend Your Royal Person
and Government; which is the greatest Duty can be rendered to Your Majesty, by

Your Majesty's most Humble, most Faithful, and most Obedient Subjects.
Subscribed in our own Names, and in the Name of the rest of the Brethren of our
Persuasion, at their desire.
