WILLIAM R.

WHereas We have been Advertised that great Numbers of Mariners and other
Seafaring Men, being Our Natural born Subjects, have betaken themselves to the
Service of Foreign Princes and States; For Redress thereof for the present, and
Preventing the like for the future, We by this Our Royal Proclamation (with the
Advice of Our Privy Council) do strictly Charge and Command all Masters of
Ships, Pilots, Mariners, Seamen, and other Seafaring Men whatsoever, and
wheresoever (being Our Natural born Subjects) who are in the Service of any
Foreign Prince or State, or do Service in any Foreign Ships or Vessels, that
forthwith they and every of them, do withdraw themselves and depart from such
Foreign Services, and return home to their Native Countries; And further We do
hereby strictly Prohibit and Forbid all Masters of Ships, Pilots, Mariners,
Seamen and other Seafaring Men whatsoever (being Our Natural born Subjects)
from Entering themselves, and do hereby strictly Charge and Command them and
every of them, from henceforth, to forbear to Enter themselves into Pay, or
otherwise betake themselves to the Service of any Foreign Princes or States, or
to Serve in any Foreign Ship or Vessel, without Our special License first had
and obtained in that behalf: To all which We expect due Obedience and exact
Conformity, and do hereby Publish and Declare, That the Offenders to the
contrary, shall not only incur Our just Displeasure, but be proceeded against
for their Contempt according to the Utmost Severities of Law. And further, We
do hereby Authorize and Command all Our Officers and Ministers, in Our
respective Ports, and all Captains, Masters, and other Officers Serving and
Employed in any of Our Ships or Vessels at Sea, to stop and make stay of all
such Person and Persons as shall endeavor to Transport or Enter themselves
into the Service of any Foreign Prince or State, contrary to the true intent
and meaning of this Our Royal Proclamation, and also to seize upon, take and
bring away all such Mariners, Seamen, and other Persons aforesaid, as shall be
found to be Employed or Serving in any Ships or Vessels belonging to any
Foreign Prince or State, or to any Merchant or other Person or Persons, being
Subjects of any Foreign Prince or State.
