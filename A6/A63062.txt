A lively voice for the King of Saints and Nations, etc.
Eighth month 11. day being the first day of the week at nine of the Clock,
1657.
THe Spirit does come in the way,
That the spouse did before,
The spouse she does declare of him,
So does the Spirit, and more
Over of God the Father too,
And they rejoice and bring
Tidings unto the world of
Christ the most glorious King,
The spouse comes with a choice svveet note,
Of Christ most blessed reign,
And the spirit it ever does,
Rejoice to do the same.
The spirit extols, and lifts him high,
And shows his great love
For 'twas his will for sin to dye,
And nothing else could move,
Which made the spouse come forth with song
Of her beloved pure,
Which must be sung to him always,
It ever shall endure.
The spouse comes forth with lovely song,
And it was envyed,
What note is this thou bring forth,
Was to her often said.
What spirit is this; O it is strange,
It differs from other,
They did against the song complain,
But she sings of her lover,
And makes unto him complaint,
That they at her do strike.
For they did tear, and rent the vayl
Of Christ's beloved Wife,
She does complain unto her King;
What injuries and smites,
O spouse my love says he still sing,
Thou art the married Wife,
Matter not though they at thee throw,
Nor what jears thou have had,
I will appear unto thy sight,
And in singing make glad.
Many do strike at thee, my spouse,
But I will take thy part
They scourge, and do thee so revile,
Come spouse to Solomon's porch;
The shines of glory makes thee sing,
And speak of love so much,
O they do not know what it is,
To have from Christ a touch:
She goes, and sets him rarely out,
Though many do scorn her,
They at the spouse do for it flour,
But she describ's her Lord.
O he is lovely to behold,
His Temples they do shine,
His locks like to Pomgrannet
They are most choice and fine,
(...) do thou Christ compare, say they,
^o Po^^granet do thou,
^iken him unto such things,
We cannot it allow.
(...) that I do answers the spouse,
^t is an emblem sweet,
(...) will describe him through out
Even from his head to feet,
His Temples, Head and bushy locks,
The spouse extolleth high,
She is taken with his looks so sweet,
And with his Dove-like eyes,
Thus she goes one and fings of him,
^or he is most divine,
What ere they say, she sings more
Of this bright lovely shine,
His countenance is excellent
^ven like Lebanon,
And like to the Cedar is my love,
He is the only one.
^ost thou, spouse, thus compare Chrik,
We Will take away thy vayl;
^oe what you will answers the spouse,
(...) speak of him that^ rare.
(...) rare, and choice he is above
^ll emblems, none can show
^orth what he is, and yet my love
^all be compared so,
^is Nostrils are fragrant,
^here is none like to them,
and what say they is more in him
Then in all other men.
(...) will not, cannot cease, says she,
He is so precious,
(...) will sing of him, for O he
^ath took my heart so much,
^e not forsake or leave the Song,
Though you do rend my veil,
(...) will go one for to declare,
He Will make it up again,
He is so choice, so sweet, and rare,
(...) have him took in heart.
O he is most beloved, and fair,
I Will speak of every part,
In describing my love and Lo^d,
He is so wondrous fair,
He is so white, so sweet, and pure
Ten thousand cannot compare.
O I do greatly love to see;
Thee and thy smiles espy;
O blessed sweets come more to me,
I am ravished with thy Eye.
Christ was bright to the spouses view,
And she did fear no harm,
And my strength it is much renewed
For the same glorious arm,
I have been laid within his breast,
O how lovely is he,
I must declare he is my rest;
So did the spouse him see:
Her Epistles were sweet of him,
Though many see it not
It is rare, and excellent,
Of matter sweet and choice,
And this matters brought forth in song,
And speaks of reigning year,
And Christ does cause her thus to Sing,
Her note is sweet and clear;
She tells how that his ointment run
And did perfume her hand;
When she unto the door did go.
O then she could not stand
Still, but declares spicknard which did
So much perfume, and flow,
Which as soon as she once had smelt
After him she did go.
She know's that the King had been there,
It was his very touch,
Because the King had drawn her heart,
She therefore loved much.
It was the King opened her eyes,
And caused obedience,
And presently she sung of him
With a deep loving sense:
It was the King opened her eyes,
To see ointment so run
And the spicknard so very sweet,
Then presently she sung,
(...),
And she did then behold
The sight that was so rare, and bright,
And shined more then gold.
It was the King opened her eyes,
And then she viewed him thus,
And so described every part,
For her soul loved much;
She describes his teeth and eyes,
His Temples that are rare,
His head, and mouth, and says of him
There Is nothing can compare.
The spouses eyes were opened,
And then Christ had a song,
And she declares the high effect
Wrought by the glorious Son.
The spouses eyes are opened,
And she sets out her Christ,
And sends a challenge unto all,
And says is any like.
Her challenge it is bold and high
^s any like to him,
Has any such a flaming eye,
There is not such a thing;
Her challenge it is bold and loud,
She does not fear her foe,
Nor what they say, nor how they smite
But praises for him flow,
She comes forth with challenge bold,
And says, O there is none,
Can show me one so fair as he,
He is the only one.
O she comes with challenge bold,
Unto professors great,
That did so much despise these things,
And so against them speak.
O he is fair, he is fair, says she,
To me he is most dear,
She runs about her Lord to seek,
None does like him appear.
O now come forth, come forth, poor souls,
Poor souls cheer up, come here,
O this is Christ, O this is he;
This is your Savior dear.
This is your Christ, O he shall reign,
This is the Solomon,
You shall have all your needs supplied,
He Is the beloved Son.
This is King Solomon, says she,
The purest white, and red,
This is the King, O this is he
My Savior and my head.
This is King Solomon whose lips
Showed such royal grace,
O this is he, its he that did,
Choose forth poor sinful race.
This is King Solomon says she,
That looks upon poor one,
And comes forth with love so free
To Daughter and to Son.
This is King Solomon says she,
That Is wise and perfect too,
And all that ever came to him
Did of his wisdom know.
O Sheba's Queen thou came'st from far,
And admired this light,
Did thou not find him very rare
Was It not a glorious sigh?
What did thou ever see like him,
That had such wisdom high,
There nothing could before him stand,
He made his enemies fly.
O Solomon thou make me sing,
Thou art so fair and choice,
Every part partakes of thee,
O thou sweetnest my voice.
This is King Solomon indeed,
Upon his royal seat,
All those that stood before it had,
In him delight most great.
O this is Solomon that is,
Served in Gold so pure;
O this is he the only King,
Whose wisdom shall endure.
O it is Solomon that has
Such dainty delicate meat,
And his attendants round about
In order most complete.
This is the King Solomon that has
His Timberels and Harps,
The Psaltery and Vial too,
Which does revive the heart.
King Solomon's attendants are
Richly arrayed indeed,
O the Kings followers are white,
They are the holy seed:
They come not forth in a strange garb,
They are glistering and white,
They sit at table with the King,
Are ever in his sight.
King Solomon's followers do go
^orth singing, and and thus clad,
With hearts that with love overflow:
This is Solomon that had
^uch wisdom and in such a way:
As nothing can compare
unto his bright and reigning day;
^or all things that are rare.
(...) this is Solomon that did
^how all things round about,
and had such a lovely sweetness
(...) heart and in his mouth.
(...) this is Solomon that had
nothing out of its place,
(...) that Sheba and Selah too
^dmired has his grace.
^how his wisdom did appear
^his ascent and seat,
(...) his disposing of every thing
(...) his most delicate cheer.
^o dishes there, but those that were
Most lovely dressed out,
^here was no burnt nor scorched fare
^nfit for Solomon's mouth.
^is beams are made of the sweet wood,
^ven of Cedar sine,
(...) is most delicate and sweet,
^n Solomon's reigning time,
(...) how the pillars marbled show,
(...) how does every thing
^^chly appear that is about
^he high and glorious King.
The rooms are large and very ^an,
Attendants noble, great,
Apparel pure and very white,
None like unto his meat.
And as the Spouse did sing before,
The Spirit does declare,
And the Spirit shall sing much more,
And nothing it does fear.
Of Solomon spirit shall sing,
He is worthy I know,
O Solomon thou art risen
Thy countenance does show:
The love and lovingness of Christ,
Thou art most fair, most rare, and choice,
Thou art sweet, royal too,
This resurrection does declare,
To me most fresh and new.
O when ointment is poured forth,
The spirit it does show,
Which so from him does flow.
O thou art risen up, o King,
Thy countenance does shine,
O thou art sweet, most sweet to me,
Much more than any wine:
O thou art bright thy looks are so,
And thy temples do shine
Like unto the Pomegranate,
Thou are most sweet and fine.
O thou art fair, thou art fair my love,
Thy eyes they flaming be,
Thy lips are like the honey comb
I do rejoice in thee.
O thou art fair, O thou art fair,
There is no spot in thee,
Even from head, unto the foot,
No blemish I do see.
O thou art fair, O thou art fair,
Thou have a smiling face;
Thy looks O Christ are most divine
Thou ownest sinful race.
O thou art fair, O thou art fair,
There is none like to thee;
There is none can show forth that grace
And royal harmony.
O blessed King, O Solomon,
What Cup is like to thine,
What wisdom can compare to thee,
No Cup has such choice wine:
O King thy cup is very sweet,
Did not John it so see,
Did not Ez^kiel taste of it,
When in vision with thee?
O did not thy John see the gold,
And it so much admire,
Thy royal glory which appeared
To him like flames of fire?
O did not John behold thy hair,
As white as any wool.
Thy pleasant looks so wondrous fair,
Which did his soul so fill?
O did he not behold the King,
And see his shining face,
Even like unto the Son of man,
In royal glorious grace?
Did not thy John be^old and see,
Thy garments which were white?
Did not thy feet like unto brass
Appear unto his sight?
Did not thy John then also hear,
Thy voice, and thou did speak
Like many waters was the noise,
That came forth from thy seat?
The sight that John had of the King,
And of his shining look,
His countenance so sparkling bright,
Did lay him at his foot:
It soon did make him know and see,
That he was nothing then
Before this bright and royal glory.
And there was showed him
A second door was opened,
He behol^s the Lords shine,
And enters in the second door
And tastes the spirits wine.
And sees what that the Spouse had sung.
And beheld what she tells,
He had a view of Heaven, and then
Feat'd not reproach from Hell.
John saw what that the spouse had said
In praises of her King,
And he declares what unto him
The Spirit in vision brings.
John saw what the Spouse had said,
And though Churches brought blows,
He does not matter it at all,
But does the vision show.
John saw what that the Spouse had said,
And his record is true.
He comes and sets a seal to it,
In his vision anew.
The Spouse she sang of ointment sweet,
And John does set forth Christ,
And declares of his whiteness,
And of his glory bright.
The Spouse she does declare of gold,
And his royalty does show,
And John does also say the King
Shall his Enemies overthrow.
The Spouse does witness to his Word,
And John in Patmos Isle
Bare record to those very truths,
Concerning him he cries.
The Spouse leaves off her Love, a song,
John the same matter he
In Gospel-time renews again
With pleasant harmony.
He did bring matter which set out
And declared Christ as King,
And to his Crown and Scepter he
A testimony brings.
The Lord will do as he thinks good
In all his holy things:
By whom he will he will publish forth
Lordly of the high King.
He binds not up himself at all
To what has been before,
Yet here does take the Spouses song,
And it anew declare,
Christ's followers shall sing of him,
And tell his wisdom pure,
And the destruction of his foe,
And his reign that shall endure,
(...) latter flock will love the song,
^^ey will rejoice therein,
^^ey will aloud shout forth the praises,
^^^t are due unto him,
^^e latter flock will understand,
^^d know the emblems choice,
^^d what the spouse did sing of him
(...) whom they will rejoice.
^hey will meet here in with John
^^d be transformed so,
^^d be high in obedience,
^^re then in outward show.
(...) ^hey will not the song reproach,
^^at comes from poor one;
^t they will also sing to him,
^^at is the only one.
(...) ^hey will say the Lords spirit,
(...) in this song appear,
(...) no cheat nor fancy;
(...) in it spirit shines clear.
(...) ^hey will say it came from God,
^^d told of secret sin,
^^d rebellions it spoke against,
^^as not from brain, but him.
(...) Solomon, King Solomon!
(...) do love thee dear,
should have Nations ring of thee,
(...) thy sweet spirit here.
(...) love Solomon the King,
^or him I live, I die,
(...) that poor ones knew more of him;
before I thither fly,
(...) love King Solomon therefore,
(...) would have all to know,
^^he glorious grace that is in him,
and his Sun-shining glow,
(...) love King Solomon therefore,
(...) have grieved so here,
that poor hearts are not laid low;
^ut at the spirit do fleer.
(...) love King Solomon therefore,
^y heart has breathed still,
and spirit has been poured forth,
^oor empty ones to fill.
O love, O love thou have brought forth,
A glorious excellent song;
B^t poor hearts will not entertain
But do the spirit wrong.
King Solomon thy loves come out.
But poor hearts run away,
And strangely are deluded from
The resurrection day.
King Solomon thy love comes forth,
And poor hearts do entreat;
But they run after other sounds,
And call thy spirit a cheat.
King Solomon thy most dear love,
Is cancelled abroad;
But yet the Seal is not marrd
But stands, according to thy word.
King Solomon thy love comes forth,
And would feign souls embrace;
But poor hearts turn away there backs,
From thy most glorious grace.
King Solomon thy love does come,
And ^unto scorners call,
But they are much offended at,
What does break down their wall.
King Solomon it is no hurt,
For them to have wall fall,
Which does keep them away from thee,
Which is the all in all.
King Solomon thy love is come,
And they have turned away,
And yet again love says to them,
Seek after Solomon's day.
O thy love, Solomon, does say,
Poor hearts why are you so
Much offended at reproof,
Which gives to sin a blow.
O dear King, Solomon, thy love
Inviteth every one,
To leave their Idols of all sorts,
And come unto thy throne.
And do not go to Rabbis which
In notions do abound;
But O pray love my spirit more,
And delight in it is sound.
King Solomon's love says, O poor heart,
Do not straggle abroad,
To any for distinctions,
But keep unto my word.
King Solomon's love says, O poor hearts,
O do not wrong your souls,
To go to others up and down,
When love his loves unfolds.
King Solomon's love calls to poor ones,
And O he does embrace,
And fall about your neck and kiss,
And call to royal grace.
King Solomon would have a kiss,
O his lips are most sweet,
O the fragrancy that in him,
Poor souls do always meet.
The love of Solomon does say?
Why are you so displeased,
Its your corruptions I would slay,
And carry you to my seat.
The love of Solomon does say,
Why poor heart do thou frown,
At that which searches matters out,
And lays flesh on ground.
Solomon's love says, why poor ones,
Do you so from me fly,
When the true searching spirit comes,
That makes sin to dye.
The love of Solomon does come,
And thoroughly reprove,
Hearken to it, it comfort brings,
Let it your spirits move,
O do not start, and go away,
When spirit does declare,
The sparkling glories of that day,
Which is exceeding rare.
But hearken to King Solomon,
His love it comes down,
And calls to refractory hearts,
To honor his great Crown.
The love of Solomon is great,
It will delight thy soul,
It cannot choose but much refresh.
Drink in these Cups of Gold.
And do not say it shallow is,
And a bare empty noise,
When that the King brings forth his meat,
Eat with him and rejoice.
If thon come, O thou will see,
His dishes are complete,
O taste of them, come, and behold
For it is not a cheat.
King Solomon, O thou art rare,
Thy meat it is well dressed,
Account not of those messes lo
Which comes for his Breast.
And Solomon does this declare,
Hearken unto his word,
It Is that thou may be raised up,
To Elders seats above.
O do not reject that which does,
Declare for Christ as King,
Against the Antichristian day,
He will deliverance bring,
It is a glorious Psalm of love,
That latter day shall find,
And the ancients shall sing of it,
And drink of the same wine.
O it is sweet, it is sweet, dear souls,
Sure you do not it know,
I long till that you drink of it,
It will make your heart glow.
O I do love to sing, O Lord,
Of thee, O did you find
The same, you would revived be,
With his sweet flagon wine.
O love, O love thou art most sweet,
Unto poor souls draw near,
That they may much delight in thee,
And in thy spirits cheer.
O thou art sweet, O thou art choice,
O let poor ones thee know,
O love, O come unto them all,
And let them see thee so.
Come love, O come unto poor souls,
That they may know thy flame,
And be refreshed very much,
With thy choice glorious reign.

Come love, come love to poor young ones,
They will thee then embrace,
And have a sight how that they do
Thy glorious works deface.
Come love, O come to poor young one,
And let them with thee feed,
Then will they die to all vain things,
And see how Christ did bleed.
Come to young ones, O come to them,
And they shall sing of thee,
And of thy royal work abroad
And of thy Victory.
Come love, O come to poor young ones,
They Will then do what is meet,
And sweetly walk along with thee,
Like unto Scripture-sheep.
Come love, O come to poor young ones,
To female, and male to,
That they may not offend the Lord,
And dishonor his Spirit.
Come, come O love to poor young hearts,
That are so prone to pride,
That they may come and run to thee,
And in their God confide.
O come, O love to poor young ones,
That they may steadfast be,
Like to the holy one of old
That did profels for thee.
Come love, O come to poor young ones,
And they will profess for truth,
And not be enemies
Unto thy Spirits lute.
O poor young ones will dearly love
Thy countenance so bright,
If thou do but appear to them
They will be changed quite.
If they do look on thee, and see
Thy Temples that appear
Like to Pomgranner, O they will be
Refreshed and much cheered.
O show thy face, love, unto them,
Thy lovely Cheeks so bright,
O its a sight so wondrous sweet
It will their souls delight.
O thou know, love, it is my great joy,
To speak in spirits shine,
To poor young ones that they may come
And drink of thy choice wine.
Because when I was little, and small
Thou did me love, and own,
I would have young ones come to thee,
And sit about thy throne.
Because that some from thee do go
And so against thee throw,
I would have others come to thee,
And of thy glory know.
Oh I would feign have young ones come,
They greatly please my heart,
O come away from vanity,
And herein take your part.
Come love, O come; give them a call,
And no trifle shall keep,
Nor any Earthly thing entice
From thy Gosple so sweet,
Come young ones, love would gain you now
From following of sin,
Can you die unto all things else,
And live alone to him.
O can you part with all things here,
He does you to him call,
Let your beloveds veil to him,
That is the all in all:
He Will give white garments unto you,
You shall be holy and pure,
And your Corruptions he will lay flat,
And make your joy endure,
Let the great God know what you say,
His love is sweet and rare:
O let it swallow up your hearts,
For he is passing fair:
O let this enter in your souls,
Not in your head and brain,
But in your inward vital parts,
Even your hearts and reins:
O love must get in you throughout,
It must possess as chief,
O it must rule in every part,
What say you? is it not meet,
It will be very sweet to you,
And your soul shall it sinde
When that he comes and meets within you
In his sweet rushing wind.
O love, thou do delight my soul,
Of thee I love to sing,
It does revive, and cheer my soul
For to extol the King.
O resurrection love is come,
How can poor ones despise,
And now for Sina keep a day
And against new Covenant shut their eyes.
The Lord does manifest himself,
O he is fair and bright,
Poor souls how can you but own him
In resurrection light.
Here is enough to rake your heart,
If you fly not from grace,
O it is sweet to see the King,
In his resurrection face.
O he is rare, O he is choice,
Love wrappeth up your friend,
It swallows up my very soul;
What unto me he sends.
And still there is more than I can view,
O it is fresh and green,
And takes the pains to talk with you,
O were it by you seen.
It would enter into your hearts,
And sink into your reins,
It would refresh you every part,
Not only swim in brain.
O love thou do delight my soul,
Of thee I love to sing,
And I am raised very high,
For to extol the King.
Lord thou have lifted him on high,
And in him writ thy word,
He is the eternal light, and Sun
That Is raised up above.
O thou have extolled thy Son,
Whom does the law comprise.
The law of love, and of Spirit;
But Children shut their eyes.
O thou have extolled thy Son,
Of thee he does declare,
And the spirit now forth is come,
^or him that is so rare.
O thy Son is thy only one,
^n him thy soul delights,
^he contest now is against him,
that shall have his birthright.
All that is said against spirit,
and arguments so high
shall tumble, and fall down before
^im, that for sin did dye,
that dyed to free from punishment,
^ obedience to that,
Which was his Fathers will, and Law
and buffetings he had,
and much reproach from sinners here,
^ut spirit does for him speak,
and Angels do rejoice about,
^he Sons high glorious seat.
O thou have exalted thy Son,
He is the Eternal Word,
and thy spirit was also one
^n Council that did move
^o frame poor man, that does surpass
How glorious is he;
^ut what is the Son that was before
^ll, from Eternity;
Before Creation did appear,
How glorious, dear God,
There was the Son that was so near,
Before the Creature had,
A being, and he shall endure,
For evermore to come,
And all things that were framed here,
Are centred in the Son;
Thou carriest all to his bosom,
And he declares the same,
And the Apostle speaks of them;
But it is in the Sons name,
Christ is the first, and only rest,
And when the Scripture came,
This rest most sweetly does appear,
(...) a glo^^ us gain.
O what a rest, O what a rest,
Thou do center all in,
O what a rest is Jesus Christ,
That frees poor hearts from sin,
O this choice rest, in secret place,
In mystery hid was;
But he came sorth in full set time,
And his love does surpass,
And he brings forth a lovely Law,
A Law that enters reins,
And also purifies the heart,
And pierces every vain,
And now that the Son is so come,
All Types are done away,
No Tables of stone does appear,
In this clear Gospel-day.
O come to me poor soul, says Christ,
O come the Father calls,
O come my love is very great,
Come and let all things fall,
To come to me, and be you sure,
You shall not loose thereby,
But have a glorious Law of love,
Within your hearts to lie.
I have a Law, I have a Law,
The Father it does own,
O now says Christ, why do you not
Flock about my high throne,
O poor souls come, O come to me,
Why will you, will you die,
Despise not the true prophesy,
That rises up so high.
Why should you not come unto me,
To me that loves so much
I bleed for you says Christ and why,
Do you not give a touch,
I loved you, when you were lost,
And made of you my choice,
That you might come away from sin
To resurrection voice.
I did show forth my heart to you,
In a sharp agony.
Why do you run away from me,
And unto Sinai fly.
I was willing to suffer wrath,
And any thing for you,
And why are you so obstinate
O come, and take a view.
I was very willing to go,
Into the grave for you,
And why will you leave, and forsake
My Covenant so new.
O what are you dead to the Law,
Moses is done away,
And yet in Gospel times you do,
Observe the Sinai day,
Why will you not obey a Christ,
Poor hearts you are deceived,
You are mistaken when that you,
Do the new Covenant leave,
You call your wise men for to plead,
And speak for Sinai breath,
It comes not from original,
But Babylon does preach.
Against the wisdom that is from above,
And the true wise in heart.
Will not be caught with subtilty,
Nor in it have a part.
O they will plead for Sharon rose,
Against gullant Ships that come,
They Will always unto Scripture keep,
And for resurrection,
O thou will stand, and be for truth,
With those that are for thee;
Thou will not let new Covenant fall,
Nor those that saithfull be.
O thou will stand with them who do
There love, and zeal show out;
But they shall be reproved that,
Against thee open there mouth.
O what Cowards Lord are they that,
Have not a word for thee;
But they do think another way,
To find felicity.
What pleading Lord is there for self,
They say it is for Brotherhood;
But it must not be looked at.
When against thee it stood.
O it is Brotherhood with Christ,
That is more sweet then all,
And for to cleave to other things,
Is a fighting against thy wall.
O thou eternal, and bright Son,
O thou art very sweet,
Thy wine does much refresh indeed,
Those that lie at thy feet,
Thou took's the Cup of salvation,
And loved in it to drink,
The which the Father gave to thee,
And did not from it flinch.
He took the Cup of salvation,
It was a pleasant draught.
He sacrificed himself for sin,
And mounted up aloft.
O now come taste salvations Cup,
O it him dearly cost,
It is a delicate sweet wine,
For him that is first, and last,
Poor souls come, and taste of this wine,
That it may your hearts draw;
So that you shall not go away,
Not stoop to Sinais Law.
O come and drink salvations Cup,
You shall not from him rent;
But you shall much rejoice in him,
That has your hearts so bent.
O come and drink salvations Cup,
And your spirits shall rise,
And you will much admire him,
And his new Covenant prise.
Come and drink in salvations Cup,
It will from sin defend,
It will tevive you very much,
And will your lives a mend.
O come and drink in salvations Cup,
Your Fathers draught is there;
He drunk it in creation work,
Come drink it without fear.
O come and drink salvation wine,
It will make you fat, and fair,
And bestow courage, and make bold
Babylons Brats to tear.
O come and drink salvation Cup,
Then you will not endure those,
That do so plead for other things
To gratify the Whore.
O come drink the reviving Cup,
And let those vile ones see,
There shall be strength against them all
That will make the stoutest flee,
You will say Lord break them all down
That are odious, and vile,
Those robbers, and treacherous ones
You Will cry for victory
Against them all, o come and drink,
And then you will not run,
To any Calculation Book
To know time, and season.
O come and drink salvations Cup,
^ will refresh you sure,
You have too often drunk muddy drafts,
Come unto this that's pure.
That you may be cleansed from sin,
Which Christ cannot abide,
And come away from Rabbis brain,
And unto him up rise.
O come and drink salvation Cup,
And you in that will find,
That Babylon is broken down,
By spirit rushing wind.
O its salvation Cup he loves,
O drink of it always,
And you will find and meet with him,
And his bright shining rays,
Prethy poor heart don't lust no more
After men's Cups so fine,
Nor bring not any thing of self,
To mix with this pure wine:
He Will give thee victory overall,
He has a Conquest day;
For his great Scepter he will bring,
Which must over all bear sway,
When thus this glorious one appears,
You shall see reigning day,
And great vengeance one all the foes,
That will not him obey.
Poor souls do you enquire for
A right way to the King,
And now declare of him abroad,
And of his glory sing.
The spirit that does tidings bring;
But you will not it hear,
But it will utter forth a Song,
And in a Psalm appear:
The spouse she did sing of her love,
The same the spirit does show,
And it to the receiver will,
Be a hot Sunshine glow,
Receivers they shall surely have
Great benefit and rest,
And thou will still declare to them,
What lies in thy breast,
Receiver come and take thy part,
Drink, and eat of loves meat;
O take in Solomon's plenty, for
Its fitted and complete,
Receiver come and take thy part,
King Solomon does it send,
It Is a mess from his Table,
Give thanks to him and bend.
Receiver come and now give thanks
For meat you have had here,
Out of the hand of Solomon,
Who loves you so dear,
O the Kings cheer is very sweet,
O receive it, o come,
These messes they are choice and rare
From peaceable Solomon,
Receiver tell me what say you,
Is not this meat most rare,
Methinks I hear some answer yes,
Is most delicious fair.
Have thou now had enough of it,
Will half a day thee feed,
Methinks I hear some answer no,
Nor enough for my need.
O come dear soul thou shall have more,
Of this pure food so fine,
The King does greatly thee commend,
That thou will stay his time.
And with his meat he also sends,
Flagons of wine to thee,
And says sit down and drink my friends,
O drink abundantly.
O come then feed, o feed with me,
Let us admire him,
That does so much refresh our souls,
With what he down does bring;
Come its a joyful day indeed,
The Lord God has it made,
Let us be glad always in him,
Was by the Psalmist said;
It is the day the great God made,
And the Apostles voice,
Is for that which was said before,
By the blessed finger choice.
The Apostle also takes the words,
And confirms them throughout;
The singer speaks of Christ high day;
So does the Apostles mouth.
O lovely Psalmist that indeed,
Did then so speak of him;
That was to come and dye, and rise,
For poor rebellious men.
A sweet singer thou art indeed,
Thou haost a delicate sound,
Thou sangest forth resurrection day,
Nothing did it confound,
And the Apostle remembers it,
And shows what in it lay.
What a rich treasure there is found,
In resurrection day.
It is a glorious Psalm indeed,
That of Christ did declare,
Of his dear Lord he often speaks,
Which was to him so fair.
And it is for him the spirit speaks;
O that poor hearts would hear,
And not have countenance so bent;
Against what of spirit appears,
If they had been true to spirit;
They should have had no loss;
But might have been armed against,
Sina's dark legal dress.
If they had been true to the throne,
They might have learned much,
And so have been defended from,
There errors empty touch.
O great and glorious blessed God,
What high words for the Son,
I call to mind that has dropped,
Forth from there nimble tongue.
It had been better o dear Lord
If words had been more few,
Than for to dye to such sayings,
Which should have actions new.
O that they may henceforth take heed,
Of what they say, and stand
Up more in actions, and practice;
For the Clusters of thy Land.
The Camp of Israel greatly speak,
Says God I know it well;
But it is Joshua and Caleb
Will sing forth Canaans knell.
I know says God that Isreal's Camp,
Has not wanted for talk,
But o I know its Joshua,
And Caleb that shall walk.
I know says God the Camp has spoke;
Of matters they will do;
But of its Joshua and Caleb,
Shall eat the clusters new:
I know says God the Camp has spoke,
Like men of ready tongue;
But o its Joshua and Caleb
That will to Canaan run
I know says God the Camp has spoke
We will do what God will have;
But this I know that Joshua
And Caleb is more brave.
I know says God the Camp has said,
That they will valiant be;
But it is Joshua and Caleb
Will go along with me.
I know says God the Camp has been,
Very high in words of love;
But this I know that it is Caleb,
That mounteth up above.
(...) says God the Camp has said,
(...) they will do great things,
(...) this I know its Joshua,
(...) its for the King of Kings.
(...) Camp they do speak much, says God;
(...) when I call for folk,
(...) ^y make excuses, and do say,
(...) have another walk.
(...) did you speak so much, says God;
(...) were your words so high,
(...) ^ew says God it was much more,
(...) in your hearts did lie.
(...) God he has a watchful eye,
(...) looks into the heart,
(...) he lets men alone a while;
(...) then strikes with his dart.
(...) God, poor soul, why did not look,
(...) to thy heart within,
(...) thou did profess too much,
^ere then a lesser sin.
^^refore says God henceforth look well,
(...) thy words come out;
(...) I will take thee tripping else,
(...) charge thy talking mouth,
(...) has an eye so searching quick;
(...) men he gets ground,
(...) by outstretched hand takes them,
(...) things are by him found,
^^ow temptations will be brought,
(...) by the prudent come,
(...) thou will soon adhere to them,
^^ough they offend the Son,
(...) though all men offended be,
(...) holy spirit here.
^^ether you present, or absent be
(...) make your sins appear,
^^ometh with words that are plain;
(...) have a spiritual depth,
(...) let all fall before it, they
^^nnot it intercept.
(...) do not take offense at love,
(...)hich comes you to melt,
(...) gain and win in your poor hearts,
(...) were it by you felt.
O souls let love persuade your hearts,
To speak more little and low;
Till actions comes forth with life,
Honor to God to show.
O soul, let love persuade thy tongue,
To speak at lower rate,
That so thy actions may declare,
Thou art at wisdoms Gate.
Where wisdom powerfully speaks,
In his choice spirits sound,
To make it known how that he can,
All other things confound.
O come and sit at wisdoms Gate;
For wisdom will you teach,
It will show forth what pleases it,
The spirit does it preach.
O come and eat of wisdoms fate,
Its excellent I know,
And thou shall then observe the King,
When he comes to give his blow.
O come and eat of wisdoms fare,
Thou shall then know his mind,
And when he blows the trumpet, then
Thou shall the trumpet find,
So as to sound against the foe,
And do as he would have.
O therefore wait for wisdoms voice,
And more of it still crave.
Be willing for to wait dear souls,
Have you got eyes within;
Are you living Creatures indeed,
What say you for the King;
Do your souls think for to be safe,
Without that living strength.
And if you have that you will find,
All things soon laid at length:
Are you living Creatures indeed;
Then try what is from life,
Have you the strength of the living,
Is it in you most rife;
Pray then what is of life in you;
What in your secret walks,
And what are you in family,
And what is there your talk,
Are you nimble for Christ of foot,
Are you useful in your place,
If you are not you cannot effect,
To see the Kings bright face;
Pray what are you that do so much
Long for apostates fall,
Have you the image of the Son,
Upon your faces all.
Pray what are you that would so feign
See the apostates down,
Or is your motion Eagle like;
For the most glorious Crown.
There Is many heady brains indeed,
That have had motion swift;
But not like unto the Eagle,
That shall set souls adrift.
The Scripture does so speak indeed,
Old scripture does so say,
If you say otherwise you must,
Have new Scripture this day.
What have you souls from old Scripture,
Do you take the Eagles way,
In soaring high up unto him,
Is your hearts right this day;
For him that is the holy one,
The King of Kings is he,
And holy works he does require,
From all that would him see.
O tell me what are you dear friends,
Are you of a living make;
Then you have eyes in, and without,
That evil will forsake;
None else for Christ will undertake;
For those that he employs,
Must be sure to present the whole,
Without a rent or flavv.
O try, O try what that you be,
And mind John's vision well,
And say not its a shallovv speech,
When it is the spirits knel.
O mind and understand the Psalm,
Slight not what it does say.
O let it enter in your hearts,
Its for resurrection day.
Christ greatly does it souls embrac,
So does the Father too,
He has dealt largely to you here,
He loves free grace to show;
But when that scorners do come here,
They count it a vain sound,
And at the Clusters they do jear,
Which in Canaan abound;
But if scorners do come again,
They shall have their part sure,
Which is that the Judge takes notice.
Of this there thought impure,
If that scorners do come again,
They shall their part here find;
How that the Lord God will appear,
Against the scorning mind.
Christ hates every scorning thought,
And the dissembling look;
Therefore you scorners that so slight
The Clusters, shall not pluck,
Or eat of them that do so speak
Against them, Christ knows your heart,
O let the scorner say no more,
He has not had his part.
O bless the Lord, O bless the Lord,
My soul shall ever say.
That does so pour out his love,
On resurrection day.
Halelujah, halelujah
I to the King will sing,
That has brought forth such royal meat,
He is the King of Kings:
Haleluja, Haleluja;
For the Pomgrannet rare,
And for that lovely view of Christ,
With which none can compare.
Haleluja, Haleluja that
This right Christ talked with me,
And showed himself so gloriously
In his choice mystery.
O in the night thou did appear,
Thy countenance was bright,
Thou did show forth thy self, O Lord,
Most sweetly this last night.
Haleluja, Haleluja will
^till breath forth, and bring
honor and praise thereby unto
^he high and mighty King.
Haleluja, Haleluja for
^his choice and blessed sound;
that here thou do bring forth a voice,
^hy throne for to surround.
Haleluja, Haleluja that
^esterday it was sweet,
and that in silence it took up,
and led unto thy feet.
^here that the Balm did sweetly run
and filled every part,
and brought refreshing unto me;
through many a piercing dart.
Haleluja also is above;
from whence love sweetly comes,
and sounds forth praises unto him,
^hat's the beloved one.
though head be pained many a time,
With the dark Sinai noise,
^et it is carried through and gets,
unto mount Sion joy.
^ this day seven night I did hear?
What greatly troubled me,
that such as do profess for Christ,
should unto Sinai flee;
^ut yesterday, O the day past,
He did revivings give,
And eased Head, and Lungs, and all,
And made afresh to live
From dying, sad, and weakening pain,
And burning heat so great,
O what a living God art thou;
What comes from thy seat.
Haleluja for yesterday was
A sweet reviving day,
O I shall still have more of it,
And in thy bosom lie.
O yesterday thou healedst me,
And in night comfort bring,
And said art thou now well my Child,
Yes thanks unto the King,
I answered, and thou did come,
Unto my soul betimes.
These looks were like the Pomgrannet,
They were most choice and fine
In the morning thou calledst me,
And said O come and eat
Of this that is sent to thee forth,
From the eternal seat.
In the morning thou calst betimes,
Unto Companions dear.
O where are you; why come you not,
The meat is dished here.
O the sweet spouse did show before,
A pattern to thy song,
And brought her Epistle to be,
A pattern unto John.
Haleluja thou shall have dear Christ,
That could not from thence go;
But thou must leave a promise that,
The spirit should overflow.
I must now go away says Christ;
But I shall come again,
And greatly will refresh your hearts,
With resurrection reign.
O here is great tenderness of love,
And here is bounty sweet;
Which is appointed unto those,
That are new Covenant sheep:
O this it is a lovely day,
Do you it so esteem,
Are you not for new Covenant,
Does it not glorious seem,
The Elders they it dearly love,
Before the thrones their place,
And they do worship and fall down
Before the Kings rich grace.
All Sinai arguments shall then.
Fall, and confounded be,
It is no error and fancy,
But a true prophesy.
O you that will and do so plead;
For this obedience here,
Against a tisen Christ indeed,
Heel come, and it cashiere.
Haleluja, Haleluja to,
The King that showers down,
And all those goodly flowers blasts,
That are from Sinai ground.
Haleluja, Haleluja is,
Amongst the Angels dear,
Who do delight in Jesus Christ,
And unto him are near,
The Angels are about his throne,
And for him they will speak.
And so does John's sweet vision,
Highly commend his seat.
O John, o thou did see the Son,
And Fathers honor high,
And the Angels that do delight,
About the throne to fly.
And thou did sing Haleluja's note,
In the most glorious sound,
And all this it is coming forth,
Babylon to confound.
O thou show all croking frogs,
Should fall into the lake,
Though now they testify against Christ,
And at his spirit gape.
John thou had lovely visions sweet,
Thou saw witness die.
And thou saw them revive again,
And Babylonians fly.
And thou declaredst of their fall,
That they should surely dye.
Thou also saw the Kings reign,
'Twas he opened thy eye.
O John thou did see holy ones,
Round about the Kings throne.
That often had sighed for Christ,
With many a longing groan.
O thou shewedst the lovely Bow,
About the seat so high.
Which no Babylonians can approach,
For it will make them fly.
O John thou saw, and did write,
Through the spirit most choice,
And did cry Haleluja,
With a sweet praising voice.
Thou excellent beloved one,
Thy visions were most clear,
Thou enteredst and had a sight,
And did the voices hear,
'Twas thou that shewedst the eternal
Which from God forth did come,
And did witness unto the same
For him that is the Son,
And John thou also do declare,
Unto the Godhead high.
That amongst men did take a seat,
And for sinners did die.
Thou show the resurrection,
And what against foes should be,
And speak of the voice of speech,
And of that high glory.
Thou then was drawn so near to it,
And entrance did make,
To view the bright rare shining son,
That did thee to him take,
Up invision in Patmos Isle,
O there he did appear,
The same Lord Jesus whom thou love,
In bosom to lie near.
O glorious is the vision Lord,
Of the latter days time,
And yet this generation,
Does not the vision mind.
Except it be through Rabbi's voice
Their wise, and prudent men;
But few of these did see the Sun,
He w'ant made known to them.
O how did John weep until that,
The Book was opened;
But then he soon was raised up,
And in him rejoiced,
That was found worthy to unseal,
O he did take delight,
To see what latter flock should have,
In his clear vision light.
He saw the Candlesticks of Gold
So pure, so fair, and bright,
And viewed the Stars the which also
Were brought unto his sight.
He loved for to behold the throne,
And one the Elders look,
And rejoiced at the opening,
Of the Lambs sealed Book.
This loving John, this loving John
How still he higher goes,
And also he the Gosple preached,
To sinners and to foes;
But when he comes to see the throne,
O how joy did abound,
O then he sung Haleluja to
The Lord for his high Crown.
When he into the City comes,
That was so paved with Gold,
O he rejoiced very much,
In that perfect rare mold.
When he into the City comes,
Where the fresh Rivers be,
He is refreshed and does pluck,
Fruit from the living tree,
When he into the City comes,
O there he does behold,
The marvelous rich shine there is,
Brighter then any Gold.
When he into the City comes,
Where Christ is admired,
How glad is he to see the Lord,
His Savior and his head.
O what a lovely way is this,
That the spirit him led,
To see and to behold the Lamb,
That for his sins had bled,
O what a dilicate sight had John,
When spirit did him call,
To see his Savior so dear,
The City and the wall.
The walls and Bulworks he did see,
That be so very strong,
O it was a choice sight indeed,
None can this City wrong,
Alas poor souls you cannot it see,
You cannot tell what is here,
Except it be for that vision,
That in Patmas appeared,
You gaze and hear a while I know,
Some wonder for to see;
But O you cannot so take in
This precious melody.
Alas you cannot see it so,
You don't this glory know.
O that you did see Jesus Christ,
It would make your hearts to glow.
O he is sweet and beautiful,
Here is holiness through all,
O here is a royalty indeed;
Which will make enemies fall.
What good will sinners have by this
That do against him come
But they shall all fall before Christ,
That is the only Son.
Alas you do come here and see;
But cannot tell what appears,
Except the Lord does come to you,
And your dark judgments clears.
O prithy sinner stay awhile,
And holiness embrace,
Be out of love with all your sins,
Now the King offers grace.
O that all sinners did once know;
What Is to be found in him.
O it cleanses the soul from guilt,
And all the filth of sin.
It would make them publish for Christ,
And declare his high work,
In publishing his great fame abroad,
And at the scorners pluck.
Who against Christ and spirit go,
When thou call's to plead,
For him and for his reigning day,
Against those that him bereave
Of what is his right, and do not teach,
In holy Gospel way,
That all may hear and know of him,
And his bright lightsome day.
O come and preach forth vengeance, Lord,
Apostates grow so vile,
O come with vengeance, come dear Lord,
To Robbers that do spoil.
O come with vengeance, come dear Lord,
That there bloods may drop out,
That do so rob and steal from thee,
Stop the apostates mouth.
O come, o Lord, come them and strike,
And all that they contrive,
O come thou and spoil all of them,
That do thy throne despise.
O come, o blessed God, o come,
Let not apostates live,
That have so reared up a Calf,
And to it honor give,
O come, o mighty God, o come,
King David come and march,
O when will thou, o King appear,
In thy triumphant march.
O David when will thou march out,
It will delight my heart;
When shall thy trumpet blow and sound,
When will thou shoot thy dart.
King David thine longs to see thee,
To see thee bend thy Bow,
To see thee in thy glory come,
With vengeance to the foe.
King David thy sweet Psalms do say,
That did delight to sing,
That the Kings foes should surely fall,
H'eel to destruction bring.
And split them that have stolen from him,
And do devourings eat,
And all of them unthrone o King,
That are in English feat.
O come, o David and march out,
That rebels all may dye,
And may not live here on the earth,
That do thy Law despise.
O I will sing, o I will sing
Of David of the King,
Who shall take hold of enemies,
And them to ruin bring;
But when will thou engage, o King
Against Robbers so high,
If this Generation had not so,
Lusted exceedingly.
They might have had Manna indeed,
And draughts of thy pure wine;
If they had not rejected thee,
New inventions to find.
O Children they have not been,
Constant unto thy way;
But they have gone after their lusts,
In this back sliding day.
O that Children were humbled,
That they have owned the rash,
That are so hardened in the way,
That against thy work does clash.
O humble, humble thy poor ones,
That thou may lift them up,
And carry them to drink of that,
Which is salvations Cup.
O King David, King David march,
Thy march does look so choice,
And it does come most pleasantly,
In Zions lovely voice.
There will be none of Zinais noise,
That will be stricken down,
It does not honor the great King
In's march, and in his Crown.
O David, David, what a time,
Have thou in England now,
When so many Idols are up,
To which poor Children bow.
King David thou love Gospel-sound,
It pleases well thine Ear,
And where are they, O where dear King
That one may this sound hear.
King David where is Gospel pure,
Do not men fancy bring;
Poor England has a mixture that,
Does not well please the King.
O come and preach the Gospel so,
That Indians may have,
And hear the precious sound of thee;
Without any reserve.
O let thy Gospel, dear Christ be,
Unto grea sinners told,
And let thy free love be held forth,
To that rebellious mold.
^et them know the Gospels great grace,
That it their souls may move.
And that they may run after thee,
And with thee fall in love.
O let poor souls temptations die,
And let them see thy face,
And look more up with open eye,
Upon thy glorious grace.
O glorious King thy sound indeed,
Unto poor ones is choice,
O come then and declare thy self,
In the new Covenant voice.
O that poor souls to it may come,
And hear of thy great day,
And so behold thy holiness,
And have a rich array.
Let none be ignorant that have heard,
Thy spouses song so choice.
Which has been teaching matter too,
And a great instructing voice.
Let not any be ignorant,
When the spirit does so sing,
The love that the spouse had to him,
Which is the only King.
O let them know and love the Psalm,
The song which is so choice,
Which does set forth Jerusalem,
In her latter days voice.
O let them love the spouses love,
The winters past and gone,
And the summer it does appear,
For the sweet time is come,
Of the Birds singing says my Lord,
And it is a choice sound:
Of praise, and glory unto him,
That does resresh our ground.
The rain is past, O it is gone,
All things begin to spring,
And this unto the latter age,
Must be sung of their King.
How does she sing of Jesus Christ,
In his sweet springing there,
O how shall spirit sing of him,
In latter ages rare.
My love, my dove, my undefiled,
His purity indeed,
Says she of him, and he of her,
As Lilly in the field.
So is my love amongst the rest,
And my beloved says she,
Amongst the sons is fairest and best,
Even as the apple tree.
And I am come to eat and drink.
Of this pure flagon wine.
And I says he of Honey Comb,
Which is most sweet and fine.
He calls the North wind to awake,
And eke the South to blow,
For to refresh his Garden and,
To make his Spices slow.
O I am come to thee says Christ,
And now he sends his spirit,
And his beloved Israel,
Shall also know his merit.
O Christ will say awake, come forth,
Arise out of the grave.
Stand up, revive, be fresh and green,
As when in youth I gave,
My self to thee, O this indeed,
Will be a blessed day,
And all shall flock forth unto it;
When once he thus does say.
For o this great and glorious thing,
Will Heathens to thee bring.
The Blackamores will run also,
To own thee for their King.
When thou thy beloved one shall bring,
To sit on thy high seat,
Others will come apace to thee,
It will thy flock complete.
When thou shall bring her unto thee
Others will rejoice therein,
That thou have shown thy self to her,
And done so great a thing.
I love to fing of her thy spouse,
To whom thou will give such wine.
I love to sing of her great day,
And of her lusterous shine,
They Will say to some, o why did you,
Go to tables of stone,
To honor and set up a day,
Against the beloved one.
O then she will say why did you so
Much for old Covenant plead,
When that the Gospel you did own,
Should you not Sinai leave.
O she will love the spirits Law,
And for it she will go;
And they that run away from it,
Shall surely have a blow.
O she will not then start aside,
She Will not arguments bring,
To strike at the new Covenant,
That concerns her King.
O what a glorious time is that
That brings the Jubily year,
O how can they do any thing,
Against this to appear.
O my heart, and head pained is,
To think what will become,
Of them that after so much love,
Do go against the Son.
O it does pain and wound my heart,
In fellowship to hear.
That against the new Covenant,
Poor Children should appear.
O blessed King, O blessed King,
O who lays it to heart.
So as to wrestle much with thee,
To arise and take his part.
That is risen up, and lifted high,
O come and break all down.
That is against new Covenant,
And resurrection Crown.
Thou bring here a spirit Lord,
Which for poor Children crave,
Yet they do not regard the song;
But when I am laid in grave,
Some shall then witness for this mouth,
And say a song indeed,
'Twas that here to us was brought down,
Souls to cheer up and feed.
Come poor souls hear the lovely sound,
It will give your hearts ease,
Think not that poor one here does speak,
Be not at it displeased.
Though the vessel be very mean,
Wherein this Counsel be,
Yet O come and partake of it,
And do not from it fly.
O it is not of Croatures make,
O had you but a taste,
You would not run away from it;
But unto it would haste.
O it is not a mixed food,
It gives counsel to all,
It does not lead from Scripture rule;
But does poor sinners call.
O the King likes well of it,
And you that are his sheep.
Do not bring weapons against it, but
Endeavor him to meet.
And O dear souls, O you that do,
So drink in this choice wine,
O have a care that nothing may,
Entice you with words fine.
And come you poor complaining souls,
That walks so near to ground,
O come you and embrace this love,
O hear the joyful sound.
O what am I, O what am I,
But a poor silly one,
A bruised reed thou make abide,
That cannot stand alone;
But o my strength is from above,
It does come forth from thee;
Which makes me so it flamed with love,
And so in singing be.
It is a glorious speech indeed,
And a most mighty voice,
O that poor souls knew more of it,
It is glorious and choice.
Lord thou giv'st much, and here do come
Thanks be given to thee.
O take it, I it here present,
Its thine, its not from me,
And thou say so I will dear Child,
Then Father, I am content,
To suffer for thy sake awhile,
And for thee to be spent.
O Lord thou do often take me up,
From every Creature here,
And I shall have a time with thee,
That are to me so dear:
O Lord I love to talk with thee,
And when up and down I go,
My soul is grieved very much,
And thou do know it is so.
And therefore says I Will take thee up,
And thou shall be with me,
And drink of my Salvation Cup,
I am glad to be with thee,
And well content to be taken,
From all beloved's here,
That so I may walk with my God,
And see him shine more clear.
Eternal word thou have spoken,
I do take heed to thee,
For thou art the sure word indeed,
And the true Prophecy.
No Error could me lop, o Lord,
From the high glorious tree,
O I will boast of Jesus Christ,
In this sweet harmony.
Nothing could ever draw me from,
Owning a scripture Christ,
And I shall still be kept to him,
And to's word all my lifs.
I long, I long, to sing over,
Hell death and also grave,
Yet I am content here to abide,
With testimony brave,
I long to be clothed upon,
And to awake and sing,
And yet I am content to be,
A witness for the King.
O blessed be God for that life,
Makes me not value any;
Because thou are unto my soul,
Above beloved's many.
I love them-all so that I would,
Not have them their posts bring,
To jussle against his that is,
The blessed glorious King.
O blessed days o blessed nights,
O let fresh praises spring,
For what the spirit does bring forth,
Let the Creation sing.
O let the Cattle praise the Lord,
Upon a thousand Hills,
O that the Birds also with praise,
The earth throughout may fill.
And o let every thing also,
That creeps on the ground,
Which was not brought forth by sins slime,
To him high praises sound.
But o let sinners know that do
Still in Rebellion walk,
It will be sad for them that have,
So much opposed and talked
Against the spirit in that day,
Wherein it called from sin,
Such shall meet with reproof from Christ,
And have a check from him.
Let none reject the living voice,
But let it take effect,
And carry out poor souls to thee,
That will not them reject.
O spirit does come forth to them,
With tidings of great joy,
O let it take the heart for thee,
And nothing shall annoy.
O then the lips shall gracious be,
And the King will them own,
Else he cannot love and regard,
Nor show his glorious throne.
O that they may come unto thee,
And here the Gospel sound,
Which Satan cannot come to reach,
For grace does there abound.
O what a royal day is this,
A blessed time most sweet,
O could you relish it poor souls,
You would great comfort meet.
But O Companions I do know,
You prize it very much,
And you do deeply drink of it,
For you have had a touch.
Companions I am glad for you,
I know you have been fed,
And you have talked with the Son,
In what the spirit has said.
Companions I do know you love,
And like pomgrannet cheer,
I know you also understand,
When emblems do compare.
I know you have received in,
The pleasure of this day,
Therefore spirit teaches to praise;
For Companions always.
O surely you are here this day,
Now fitted for much more,
That shall come forth from Jesus Christ,
From his rich precious store.
O will you wait here many days?
Will you from pleasures fast?
Me thinks I here companions say,
Yea while the vision lasts.
O you Companions witness shall,
Unto these things so choice,
And shall plead for the song always,
Through the spirits voice.
O praise the Lord for Companions,
Through whom witness does come,
For matters that have here been brought,
Through the Eternal Son.
Haleluja, Haleluja Lord,
For companions I will sing,
And praises shall be given here,
Because they have not been
Carried about, nor yet enticed,
From thee by any means,
And they shall he e meet with reproof,
If on Creatures they lean.
Haleluja Haleluja for,
Companions that do come,
And are not wedded to any thing,
But to King Solomon.

And to thy melody.

And in thy presence be.

And delight in his spirit,
And praise thee for Companions true,
That shall such joys inherit.
Haleluja, Haleluja still,
Angels shall sing above;
For they are pleased with poor flesh,
And do Companions love.
Haleluja, Haleluja for,
Those that witness to thee,
Lord Jesus that did come in flesh,
There Is few that faithful be.
O when that Christ did come in flesh,
He had witnesses few,
It was a hidden mystery,
Of which most nothing knew.
Haleluja, Haleluja that,
Thou bring in such who,
Desire holily to walk,
With Conversation new,
Haleluja, Haleluja
Let Gath, and Askelon,
Know that the spirit is come here,
And Haleluja song.
Let sinners and Saints also know,
And yet not angry be,
That Christ has justified those,
That love his harmony.

and for thy powerful workings here,
Which nothing can deface.

^^r Companions so dear,
though a poor little Company,
(...) them the whole appears.

Which John so white did see,
^^nging of Haleluja's praise,
about the throne with thee,
(...) they show forth the thousands Lord,
that shall have glory bright,
that have sighed and gron'd for thee,
and for David shall fight.
(...) Companions be therefore such,
^ike to the Elders white,
^o that the King may come to you
^o converse, and delight.
(...) companions be like to those,
^n conversation choice,
and look to Christ with fixed eye,
and hearken to his voice.
Haleluja, Haleluja that
^ou shall for ever sing,
And be beholding of the throne,
Whence such enjoyments spring.
O then do you Companions praise,
And long for this sweet time,
O breath after Christ coming souls,

O it will sweetly ravish you,
O do you call for this,
unto the glorious blessed King,
^t is perfections bliss.
O you shall sit with him on thrones,
And see the lamps of Gold,
And the world as brittle glass,
When you these things behold,
O what a day, what day is this,
O it inflames my heart,
And does it not the same with you,
It takes hold of each part.
Haleluja, Haleluja Lord
For what thou do now show,
Unto the latter age and flock,
And much more they shall shall know.
O they shall have indeed much love,
And mighty strength for thee,
O they shall shine most fair and bright,
In holiness to thee.
O what a time shall that be Lord,
When all shall fall flat down,
In honor of thy glorious day,
And thy eternal Crown.
O blessed time, O blessed time,
That Christ will surely bring,
And they that have intelligence,
They cannot choose but sing,

Thy time comes so swift,
O it is hastening apace,
And unto glory lifts.

And thy John shall triumph also,
In thy reviving voice.
Haleluja, Haleluja that
Ezekiel then shall fly,
That saw the wings about the throne,
With pleasant Harmony.
Ezekiel that was troubled here,
And so much sorrow knew,
Shall then rejovce and sing with John,
And with the Elders to.
O then Ezekiel, and thy John
Shall not any more weep,
Nor rebellious ones so trouble them,
When thus with thee they keep.
Haleluja, Haleluja for
This glory unto them,
That shall appear so bright and fair,
Amongst thy noble men.
This joy is come down here in Psalm,
Praises to thee to say,
And Haleluja for that,
In this delightful day.
Haleluja, Haleluja that,
When I shall lie in grave,
This generation will say,
A sign, a sign we have
Had, for it was a sign indeed,
And it did often bring,
Tidings unto poor sinners of,
The glorious bright King.
O that poor souls did know the joy,
That I have from above,
O it would raise them very much,
They would the vision love.
O blessed be the glorious Lord,
O thou do sweetly shine,
Both day and night thou do come forth,
With thy refreshing wine.
O thou have called me o Lord,
To speak of thy high time,
And told'st me that I must declare,
And made my heart incline,
Thou bid'st me sing forth of the spouse,
I said how shall I sing,
The praises of Haleluja,
Thou said that it should spring,
And so i^ has, O blessed Christ,
O my beloved one,
In a most foolish empty Child,
For it is from thee alone,
What have thou done for England here,
And yet they fly away,
O spirit shall justify thee,
And thy triumphing day.
O come, o come beloved choice,
To every poor heart,
That they may love to follow thee,
When thou do shoot thy dart.
O come, O Lord bring spirit down,
Let us the Mantle have,
For thou when thou ascendedst high,
A double portion gave.
O how I long to see thine shine,
And in holiness walk,
And to be holiness throughout,
In actions, and in talk.
O come, o love, o come thou forth,
Pray do not longer stay,
For the insulting world does go,
Against thy glorious day.
O come, o love, o come thou forth,
The Saints do for thee call,
And the Elders desire also,
To see thee all in all.
O come, o love, o come for all,
The world will be ashamed,
Of what they have done against thee,
When thou appear'st in flame.
O come, o love, o come, o love,
O let thy Bride appear,
And then shall Haleluja go,
In thy shinings so clear.
O come, o love, o come forth love,
O thine must call thee down,
That thou may beautify them more,
For thy rich and high Crown.
O come love and break forth apace,
Overcome each stout one,
That they may be conquered at length,
And come to thee alone.
O come, o love, o come, o love,
The Box is opened,
Wherein the precious ointment new,
And its poured one thy head.
And now o love break thou the B^x,
And thy sweet ointment will,
Refresh and melt the very heart,
And it with singing fill.

O then my soul thou shall him praise,
And great rejoycings bring,
For O my soul thou art in love,
With the high mighty King.
And O my soul praise thou the Lord,
Father shall it do so,
Methinks I hear thy answer sweet,
And after thee I Will go.
I Will sweetly roll my self in thee,
And hear the joyful sound,
Which from above is sent to me,
And more shall here abound.
For of Jerusalem o Lord,
I shall both speak and sing,
Of that beloved ancient one,
Which shall revive and spring.
And I shall sing grace unto them,
That have revived much,
O show thy mercy unto them,
And give their hearts a touch.
O come to every poor soul now,
Thy strength and wisdom bring,
Against there objection for to fight,
And make them praise and sing,
The stone of which the Apostle speaker,
It smites to the ground,
And it is the stone which Daniel tells,
Shall strike all powers down.
And it shall split Apostates too,
It is a royal stone,
It undermines what ever does,
Oppose the glorious one.
Lord Jesus thou have appointed,
With thee is the set time,
And yet poor silly Children,
To others do incline.
To Rabbi's and to learned men,
And do not wait on thee;
But by another Gospel they,
Strangely deluded be.
And they do not consider how,
That the spirit did slow,
When as a rushing wind it came,
According to thy word,
And that the self same spirit does,
In after time and day,
To John and others to come forth,
So that what Joel said,
Must not by any be confined,
Unto the cloven tongue,
Therefore poor souls take heed of this,
Do not the spirit wrong.
Whose wisdom and power is seen,
He is not tied to time,
But does bring forth a glorious Psalm,
A song that is divine.
O what a day have waiting ones,
O what variety,
Has here come down from Jesus Christ
For to open the eye.
O what a day have waiting ones,
What does the spirit bring.
For to draw up your hearts aloft,
Unto the King of Kings.
Will you go home and bring your hearts,
To morrow here again,
Will you beg that what you have heard,
May in your hearts remain.
O tell me now you waiting ones,
Is not your heart through warm,
With the suel that is from spirit,
Then nothing can you harm.
O latter comers do not think,
O we can have the same,
What can you in one hour or two,
Of this choice wisdom gain.
O waiters o do you receive,
A blessing from the Lord,
O now do you go home and pray,
He Will to your voice accord.
And pray for your companion,
That Is still to be imploid,
In the discovery of God,
That she may have much joy.
That she may still have strength maintained,
From the fresh living spring.
And be enabled much more,
Of his great love to sing.
Jerusalem, o I love to see,
Thee in thy sweet smiling face,
I love for to behold thy Crown,
In this bright Vision place.
Jerusalem though thy walls be,
So broken and so down,
The Lord Christ he will come to thee,
And give thee a high Crown.
Jerusalem, though thou bee's now
So scattered abroad,
Thou shall be raised up, and thou
Shall call upon thy God.
Upon thy God thou shall then call,
Through the Sonns voice and power,
And thou shall see thy great increase,
In that most joyful hour.
Jerusalem, though thou art so,
Spoiled in every place,
Thou shall have a return where thou,
Shall see Eternal grace.
Jerusalem though thou art gone,
Into remote parts far,
Thou Shall be brought unto that place,
That is exceeding rare.
Jerusalem, though thou art now,
So hissed at by all,
O thou shall come, and triumph here,
And rise from thy great fall.
Jerusalem, though now they talk
Against thee, and thee despise,
O thou shall come, and all thy folk,
Unto high glory rise.
Jerusalem, though thou art now,
So frowned upon by all,
O thou shall come, and they shall then,
Smile about thy high wall.
Jerusalem, though thou art now,
So scattered in thy bones,
O thou shall come unto thy Christ,
And set one glories throne.
Jerusalem, o thou shall be,
The Elders bright indeed,
That shall admire there Kings reign,
And on thee he will feed,
^or he will not disdain to feed,
On what thou do him bring,
It Is of his own, of his own seed,
And you will together sing.
Jerusalem thou shall him praise,
And thy dry bones shall sing,
^n this thy resurrection,
And shout forth to the King.
Jerusalem thou shall then be,
Thou shall with open face,
Be still beholding of thy head,
^n his clear Gospel Grace.
Jerusalem, O thy looks will,
^o please thy Savior, he
Will rejoice, and delight in this,
Thy pleasant harmony.
Jerusalem, thou shall come forth,
With a chaste nimble foot,
And O thou shall admire him,
That brings the joyful note.

Shall wax so strong and high,
Thy strength, thy walls, they shall ascend,
And make thy enemies fly.
Jerusalem, O thy lovely face,
Thy resurrection cheeks.
It does delight to behold.
In this retirement sweet.
To see thy steady steadfast eye,
That does delight in Christ,
To see thy heart and love to him,
That for thy sins did dye.
O it is choice unto Gentiles,
Unto Barbarians rare,
I love to see Jerusalem,
And her delicious fair.
Jerusalem I love to see,
To see thy North-winde blow.
And eke thy South refreshing sweet,
Which makes the spices flow.
Christ Nostrels delighted be,
Thou shall be raised high,
His love and pleasure is in thee,
And thy enemies shall fly.
Jerusalem O thou are she,
That art the wedded wife,
And thou shall sit down with him that,
To thee will bring sharp knife,
To cut off all thy for^kins then,
And circumcise thy heart,
For thou shall then most willing be,
And he will take thy part.
O thou shall then declare high things,
And others shall them know,
And be refreshed with those things,
That from thy heart does flow:
Jerusalem, O thou art she,
That Christ does love so dear,
Thou art the first beloved one,
Thou unto him art near,
To thee thy Christ will tell his mind,
And thou shall do the same,
He unto thee, and thon to him,
Each other shall instame.
Jerusalem, O thy bright look,
Greatly does ravish me,
Thy River, and delightful brook,
And thy sweet harmony.
Jerusalem, O thy looks are,
Not rolling up and down;
But thou do keep a steady eye,
Upon thy Saviors Crown.
Jerusalem, O thou art she,
That will admire Christ's name,
And thou will trumpet and rejoice,
In the beloved's reign.
O dear Jerusalem thou will,
Make Gentiles glad in thee,
When that thou come and own'st a Christ,
And unto him does flee.
What great increase shall he enjoy,
When Jews and Gentiles seek
Unto him from the Islands round,
And all his Children meet.
Jerusalem, O thou will not,
Then for mount Sina speak,
Thou will not at all Hagar love,
When on the Elders seat.
When thus thou do behold his face,
He then will make thee great,
He will exalt thee to high place,
And give thee elders seat.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
O thou do take my part,
Although this generation,
Against me shout there darts.
Yet I am raised up and fed,
I see my Saviors eye,
And the Pomgrannet juice so red,
I do in him espy.
Jerusalem, o thou art dear,
My heart is took with thee,
Psalm is down brought in note so dear,
To sing thy harmony.
O dear Jerusalem, thou shall
Appear as Joseph's bow,
His goodly branches then thou shall,
Of all Christ's truths allow.
Thou shall not look for him in grave,
Nor any such thing say,
But thou shall to new covenant run,
And resurrection day.
Jerusalem now thy theme is,
Come sweetly to my heart,
And I rejoice to sing of thee,
It will not from me part.
Jerusalem, o thou art she,
That all the world shall know,
To be the first beloved of Christ,
And to thee all shall flow.
Jerusalem, thou art beloved,
For thou art the Kings wife,
And thou art she that will admire,
Him in sweet singing plight.
Jerusalem, O at thy call,
The gentiles forth will come,
And at thy high loud praising voice,
The blackamors will run.
Jerusalem, O thou shall call,
The Hethenish Indians round,
Of those poor black ones unto thee,
Upon thy holy ground.
Jerusalem thou will invite,
Such poor lost ones abroad,
That they may come unto the sight,
Of thy beloved Lord.
Jerusalem, o thou shall take,
A great command on thee,
Dogs shall not bark, and for thy sake,
All things shall silent be.
O then the Dragons shall not rore,
Thy sweet ears to offend,
The wolfs shall not make prey of thee,
But to thee all shall bend,
Jerusalem, o then there shall
No cockatrice eggs come out,
To bring forth serpents to destroy,
Or interrupt thy mouth.
Jerusalem no spider shall,
Their webs spin upon thee,
For thou shall have the royal robe,
O the high Kings glory.
Jerusalem, o there shall none,
Come any way at all,
To trouble or to molest thee,
When Christ for thee does call.
O thou shall walk in galleries,
In a prospect complete,
And thou shall sing and much rejoice,
Upon a royal seat.
Jerusalem, thou shall up stand,
In stature high and tall,
O what a company will be,
Within salvations wall.
Jerusalem thou shall be freed,
From all dangers great,
Because the King has given thee,
A glorious fixed seat.
O what enamourings, o what love,
Between thee and thy Lord,
Thou shall have pretions food from him,
And manna from above.
Thou shall have hidden manna then,
Not measured in sight,
But it shall ever issue forth,
Even from the tree of life.
Coming from thy beloved one,

^^^e hope of Israel, Isreal's, hope,
(...) Israel thee know,
(...) gav'st them a name in Jacob,
(...) did such valor show.
(...) Isreal's hope for whom Jeremiah,
(...) Prophets all did so mourn,
^^ome raise, her out of the dust,
(...) is thy true firstborn:
(...) Isreal's hope that gave to them
(...) Jacob that prevailing name,
^^en wrestling with him thou did say,
(...) Israel should reign.
Of Isreal's hope that told Jacob
Of such a Crown for ever,
When he prevailed so with God.
Isreal's everlasting Father;
And hope that comforted Jacob,
And gave him such a name:
Let them come to that blessed Throne,
Where is eternal gain.
O Isreal's hope that loved Jacob,
And therefore did let him know,
That thy Judah shall bear the name,
And prevailing for thee go:
O Isreal's hope in whom Jacob
Had great familiarity,
Great boldness and very much strength,
He would not from thee fly;
O Isreal's hope that Jacob did
So closely cleave to there,
That he said I Will not let thee go,
Till thy arm is made bare:
The which by Jacob then was seen,
And to him did appear
To be for him a Conque our,
Bringing forth victory there:
O Isreal's hope in whom Jacob,
Had such great confidence,
That he said till thou blessest me,
I Will not let thee go from hence.
Art thou so bold? Jacob thy God
Liked it exceeding well,
And where there are such sweet replies,
Blessings abound and dwell.
Do thou say that thou will not leave,
Says God, till blessings fall?
Art thou of such a public spirit?
I will thee Israel call,
Seeing Jacob thou have such strength,
And eagerness for me,
Thou shall become a Conqueror,
And a great Triumph see:
Thou shall enjoy a public name,
That art of such a spirit,
Thou shall be called Israel,
And this honor inherit.
O the hope of Isreal's, a holy hope,
And remains to this day,
Thy Jeremiah groaned and cried,
To thee for her always.
O the hope of Israel, Isreal's hope,
Therefore she cannot dye,
Thou art so sure an anchor that,
Floods cannot make her fly.
O the hope of Israel is sure,
Thou will not always stay,
Thou will bring her out of the dust,
And Judah shall obey.
O come Jacobs deliverer,
O come thou glorious rest,
O come thou Jacobs friend, o come
For Sion is oppressed.
Come Isreal's hope it was for thee,
That Jeremiah did groan,
And that Ezekiel desired to see,
Upon thy glorious throne.
O Isreal's hope, Daniel longed for this,
And desired to know the time.
He longed those blessings for to see,
And to taste of Jerusalems wine.
O the hope of Israel these did
Sweetly preach forth thy grace,
That so Rebels might leave their sins
And run a blessed race.
O the hope of Israel he was,
Most choice in Amos eye,
He could not endure Jeroboam,
Nor his calf should up rise,
He did love to preach those commands,
Was against Idolatry,
He did not fear any there,
That did against him rise.
He was willing to lie at thy feet,
His humility was great,
He was bold against wicked Princes,
And thy commands did teach.
O the hope of Israel it was for thee,
Iona was cast in sea.
And swome in the whales belly, to
Show forth thy victory.
For by this it was declared and showed,
How that thou should come
Forth through the belly of the earth,
To show resurrection.
O the hope of Israel for whom,
Joel did so love to show,
That spirit should be poured out,
And give your foes a blow.
Thou will appear for temple-work,
Temple-work of latter time,
And the prophet Haggai rises up,
With an encouraging wind.
For to call to the governor of Judah,
To speak for temple work there,
And to Joshua with the remnant
To fall to that work rare.
And for this temple Habakkuk,
Does speak from vision true;
But there were some that also said,
These are delusions new.
And were ready to say that this,
Should not accomplished be,
But Habakkuk rises and declares,
That which is for Judah.
The prophets sweetly do declare,
The latter singing state,
And says God will rejoice with singing,
Over Israel at high rate.
And they shall see evil no more,
Shall not miscarry or fear;
But sweetly rejoice in the Lord,
And his glorious works declare.
Zephaniah did prophecy,
What Israel should enjoy,
When that no evil should approach,
But everlasting joy.
Zephaniah loved to prophecy,

O the hope of Israel do thou,
Bring thy beloved dear,
In thy own household, for with her,
There is none that can compare.
O Isreal's hope, if that Prophets,
In that time, for them cried,
Sure it is nearer, and for them,
A voice must here up rise.
O let thy Israel behold,
And see Pomgrannets choice;
About thy Temples to appear,
And let them hear thy voice,
That wilt inflame their hearts with love,
And with affection dear.
O come, come Isreal's hope, O come
Give them the Jubily year,
O bring in Israel to thee;
Let them behold thy Crown,
And they will talk of thy wonders great,
And of thy high renown.
O thy beloved John was grieved,
To see Judah broken down,
To behold the wasting of that City,
It made his soul to mourn.
O he mourned to see its spoil.
It made thy John to weep,
Till that he did see the Temple,
And did espy thy seat.
O he rejoiced to see the Temple,
So to be raised up,
In such a glorious manner, and,
Seven trumpets did break forth.
O praised be the Lord our God,
That has sent forth a Psalm,
To speak of Isreal's blessed hope,
And of his glorious arm.
And praises be given to him,
That is Judahs great King.
Unto him that is Isreal's God,
And will cause there rising.
Then shall there be no mixtures, nor
No Moses in that day;
But Jesus Christ shall worshipped be,
In his own manner and way.
The 13th. Day of the eighth Month. 1657.
Here begins a Dialogue between the Father and the Son
I Am willing says Jesus Christ,
To come in such a form,
And I do not grudge to be made,
A servant here to warn,
To warn sinners up thereby,
And to draw them to thee;
O says the Son, I love this work,
It is felicity.
But Son says God, thou also must
Be pinched on the Cheek,
And thou must have thy hair plucked off,
O this must be thy seat.
A seat of sorrows Son thou must
Have and rebukes below;
Well Father says Christ, I am content,
And do not fear to go;
But Son unto the slaughter thou,
Must be brought as a sheep.
And be a gazing stock to all,
And with derision meet;
Be it so says the Son, seeing God,
Will have me so to do;
I am content to be so used,
That sinners may be new;
But Son thou must do more than this?
What say thou unto that,
Can thou bear the great heavy stroke,
Which will lay thy heart flat,
I that I can, says the dear Son,
I will bear what thou will,
That so I may go cleanse, and purge,
Poor sinners from their filth;
Thou must satisfy all, O Son,
And every thing fulfill,
And give what ere I do require?
What say thou is it thy will.
The Law will have its full due sum;
That sinners should have brought,
O be it so, says Jesus Christ,
I will drink up this draught.
The Law, and death, and sin at once,
Will come upon thy back,
O says the Son this cannot me skare,
Not in doing me slack,
And the Father does likewise say,
This will cause a going,
Of the sharp spear into thy flesh,
Pierced by cruel men,
And then the blood and water will.
Gush out from thy sweet side.
O though it does says Christ, I will
In my Father confide;
But Son thou must be left alone,
Disciples will fall asleep.
Thouh they do yet, I will look up,
Unto my Fathers seat.
But Son the hand that dipped with thee,
In that sweet dish of meat
Will take money to sell thee, and
Will thee betray and cheat;
Be it so says the Son, yet I
Will not start from thy will;
But cheerfully go one, and not
In any tittle sail;
But son to add unto all this,
They Will sell thee to the foe,
And thy company and number
shall have a broken toe.
^e it so says Christ yet I shall soon,
Make up the number again,
(...) shall be complete in number,
(...) my throne, and my Reign.
And still the son says Father I,
Will cheerfully on go;
^or to accomplish redemption,
amongst rebellious folk.
^ut then Pilot will thee condemn,
^e'l condemn thee to death,
^his says the son don't sadden me,
^or it will bring much health.
^ut there valiant Peter will fall,
and he will thee deny,
^e that thou said shall be a rock,
Whereon to build so high.
(...) it is he shall deny thee,
(...) open common place,
(...) but says Christ hereby I shall,
^ave a season for grace.
^ut son thy valiant Peter will,
^eny thee till he swears,
and that will be much more I know,
^hen plucking off thy hair.
though says the son it will greive me,
^et I shall there have grace,
^rought by my Father to give him,
(...) shall him meet apace.
and he will look back on me again,
^o whom this grace will shine,
and so he shall see his own heart,
and be humbled in time.
^ut son thou must be led to cross,
And disciples fly away,
What then will thou do when they are not,
^o carry cross in that day.
^hen says the son thou will provide,
^ome stranger there about,
And if a stranger bear my cross,
(...) shall see grace shine out.
And I shall the more thee admire,
Therefore I do not fear,
To venture upon the whole work,
To bring deliverance here.
O but my son there will come more,
Thou must be nailed to cross,
And there hang between two robbers,
This thou must have at last.
Well if it be so, yet I will still
Say thy work it is sweet,
For I shall there meet with and have,
More company to thy sent.
Though I one of my number lost,
Thou on cross bring again,
This does not startle me at all,
Nor will not my glory stain:
But son the while thou art there nayl'd,
They Will offer bitter gall,
Although they do, yet says the son,
I will not let work fall.
But son what if thy father should,
Withdraw in latter time,
O though it will most bitter be,
Yet I will drink this wine.
For says the son, I must show forth,
A sutableness in all,
Therefore if that Eclipses come,
It is but for high call.
But son thou must be laid in,
A sepulcher so new,
That its firm stone, and will bear seal,
That none may thee remove.
But says the son, though stones be strong,
And sepulcher sealed up,
I know that thou will reach thy hand,
Thou my God wilt me pluck.
But son thou must lay there three days,
And many hearts will flag,
Well says Christ though they do yet,
My voice shall make them glad,
O I do know there hearts, although
They do question, yet I
Will carry resurrection flame,
And quickly open eyes,
My John to whom I am so dear,
He that showed love so high,
O he shall discover the son,
That for sinners did dye,
He shall sweetly show forth this thing,
The father to advance,
O he shall show the son does bring,
A choice deliverance.
When resurrection son shines out,
O John he shall declare,
And all his sorrows done away,
All sin all wrath and fear,
O John does show this very Christ,
To whom the father spoke,
He is revealed unto us,
And does discoveries make.
This very Christ, o this bright son,
Is risen up and he,
Is first beheld by handmaids poor,
Mary she must him see.
John loves him, but Mary must tell,
Handmaid was first with him,
To her the Savior did appear,
And by her showed to men.
John does not disdain to take in,
The handmaids which were there,
Who did so much love Jesus Christ,
And resurrection rare.
O John he did speak of hand maids,
Whom Christ did love so dear,
And tells that Jesus Christ he did,
To handmaids first draw near.
O John his record of the son,
Is very sweet indeed,
He does discover him to be,
The glorious lovely seed.
John he showed forth Jesus Christ,
In his bright glorious shine,
And his great secrets are with him,
O John speaks most divine.
What he saw from ^^riginall,
In the Eternal state,
He does show forth and it declare,
At a high blessed rate.
O how he does exalt the son,
And lift up in our eyes,
And does declare in what he says
A whole Christ is comprised.
He does set forth his lovely Lord,
As a pure pattern here,
That so all may view Jesus Christ,
And his great love dear.
John sets forth Christ in that he came,
So poor, so low, and mean,
And says this is the very Christ,
On whose bosom I did lean.
This is the Christ that came to thee,
Its he cleanses from sin,
Its he that justifies the soul,
And sanctifying brings.
Come come to him, says John, poor souls,
O how humble was he,
To suffer and endure so much,
To bring forth victory.
This is the son, o this is he,
This is the only one,
That has suffered and endured so much,
To bring redemption.
This is the son, o this is he,
That was so slain for sin,
And he will wait till that he does,
Shine forth to all as King.
And his shall reign on earth as Kings,
And priests and prophets too,
The which the Harlots prophets and,
All antichristians rue.
And they which have so gone about,
To break and to strike down,
O they shall then all fall before,
His high and mighty Crown.
Says John, this is the son indeed,
That is a shield to them,
That to him for all safety come,
Against the perjured men.
O this is he, this is the son,
That was a servant here,
For to fulfill his fathers law,
Which lay in his heart dear.
And then said God, my Son come up,
(...) thy own glory be;
(...) thou have been faithful, and got
(...) perfect victory.
(...) Son, my Son says God thou have
^^lfill'd and pleased me,
(...) come my Son, thou shall rejoice,
And thy souls travel see;
^y Son, my Son, thou have fulfilled
and nothing could thee fear,
(...) come my Son, and thou shall have,
(...) kingdoms for thy share.
(...) come my Son, O come my Son,
^^at did not fear the grave,
(...) thou art lifted on the throne,
(...) Kingly garments rare.
(...) come my Son, o come my Son;
(...) I do love thee dear,
^ho had such love unto thy foes,
(...) thou did make appear
(...) come my Son, for thou have won,
(...) Crown, and mighty throne;
^^ho wast so willing to go forth,
(...) or sinful flesh to own.
(...) come, I do in thee delight,
^^ou shall the kingdom have;
^^ou that of thorns did wear the Crown,
which sinners scorning gave.
(...) come my Son, o come my Son,
(...) thee does lie the power,
^^ou shall put all things under thee,
^^now the time, and hour.
(...) John he wrote down all these things,
(...) did record of thee;
^^om what he saw, handled and felt,
^^om thy Eternity.
and spirit comes forth with this word
(...) grace, and love so pure,
With this sincere and wholesome food,
Which ever shall endure.
(...) John he loved very much
(...) he dear and precious Son,
and could therefore speak of his death
and resurrection,
Of his humane low fleshly state,
And of his Godhead high,
In declaring the lovely Son,
He said what he espies.
This Son he is the eternal word,
That from above comes down,
And here takes up a place, and seat
And then retakes his Crown,
A holy glorious Christ is preached,
By the beloved John,
Who kept in mind original,
And so declares along.
O dear choice John was much raised;
For he had been lifted high,
And instructed in School most pure
Of the eternity.
O John was often taken up,
And had a view I know,
Which made him love, and speak so much,
Of loves hid flaming glow.
O John by spirit he was led,
And whether did he go,
To read in the Original,
Great mysteries to know:
John a brave witness unto truth,
In Patmas did remain;
For testimony unto Christ,
And it was Eternal gain:
In Fathers bosom he was laid,
And mercy seat did see,
And he obtained glorious things,
From the bright Diety:
O John what afterward must be
Desired much to know,
And therefore press on to it,
And entering further goes,
And the further, the more he see,
And the more does admire;
The more in vision he beholds,
The greater's his desire.
O glorious writer, Lord, indeed,
Was thy deat John of thee;
He was not silent, but he does,
Hold forth the things he see,
He showed (...) Jesus Christ,
Who sat on throne so bright,
The enemies ruin and fall,
In his great conquering fight.
He showed that all restored should be
That in Creation time
Appeared so green, so fresh, and new
In its beauty and prime.
He showed that all was in the son
When he appeared in place,
Creation-groaning is done away
Through restitution grace.
O what a witness art thou John
Of Christ and of his spirit,
O thou shall sit on Elders seat
Through thy dear Saviors merit.
John thou will not offended be
That handmaids here should sing,
That they should meddle to declare
The matters of the King.
John will not be displeased that
They sit about the throne,
And go unto original.
And nothing else will own.
John he will not oppose and speak
Contesting against that,
But O John will be pleased with
What lays flesh so flat.
O John will not condemn the song,
But rejoice that the King
Has handmaids that are risen up
To speak the truth for him.
O John, O loving John thou will
Be like thy master here,
For when on earth he went about,
Handmaids to him were dear.
O what a glorious writer's John,
That goes down so deep
Into the hidden mysteries
To fetch matter and speech.
O John he declares Christ as man,
And Christ as God also,
And thus he will oppose and smite
Those that against him go.
And when the Antichristians came,
John he waxed more bold,
In any thing if they deny
Christ, he will faster hold.
For he is the eternal light,
He is very God and man,
The bright, the holy, and pure One,
Thus of him speaks John.
And he will not let this truth to go,
For it was what he knew,
He said he is the Alpha, and
He is the Omega too.
O John he had enjoyed the seal
That comes from above,
And therefore John and Mary does
Abound so much in love.
O blessed be the Lord of love,
That does with spirit crown,
In bringing forth that harmony,
The which does here abound.
Halelujah, Halelujah, will
I here for ever sing,
For thou with Crown and Scepter here,
Do show thy self as King.
Halelujah, Halelujah that
Thy spirit here is plain,
And it does strike at every sin
That in the heart remain.
And every one that falls down,
And lies at thy feet,
Thou will be sure to lift them up
And set them on high seat.
Thy Word and offer it is plain,
Thy method it is choice,
O every unbelieving heart,
Pray come and heat this voice.
This day thou have thy kindness shown,
Though many do disdain,
Yet thou have some choice spirits here,
That do not count it vain.
Thou here have sober ones, O Lord,
To whom thou have been sweer,
And they do relish the rare things,
They do in spirit meet.
O thou have some choice ones, O Lord,
That in thy heart do see,
And thou art loving unto them
That follow after thee.
O thou do love poor hearts, O Lord,
That will not thee deride,
Although thou come in a way
That wise ones do despise.
O thou do love poor souls that will
Not from reproof them hide,
Though that the spirit meets with sin,
And at corruptions chide.
O thou do love poor souls, and say,
O do not open mouth
Against that which offers grace to you,
And would your sins cast out.
Come here says love, and be no more
Desirous of that,
Which will bring death and hell at last,
And lay your glory flat.
O come poor soul, says love, O come,
Where have thou been so long,
Why have thou not come into me,
Whose affections are so strong.
O come poor soul, and do not now
Excuses to me make,
But when that love is offered,
Pray come and eat and take.
What say thou to Original,
Pray take and eat the Book,
And thou will find much sweetness there,
And love therein to look.
The spirit does make very much
Of every word and thing,
And gives encouragement to that
Which exalts Christ as King.
Therefore do thou do so, dear soul,
Go against the beast still,
For him that is so pure and bright
For to fulfill his will.
O what a spirit soul is this
That fain would conquer thee,
It is a loving spirit souls
And it will make you free.
O (...) Doctrine it is plaint,
Its application new.
O treasure up the Doctrine
And application too.
It is a lovely Doctrine,
But do not take it ill,
That applicat on also comes,
But O embrace it still.
O love application so choice,
Though it should break thy bone,
It is to let out corruption,
Do not against it groan.
O blessed and most glorious God,
This day is very sweet,
What say you unto it, dear friends,
Do not you it so meet.
O scorners understand it not,
You do not search and know,
And how then can you feel and find
The glorious shining glow,
You say it is a poor silly one
That her own words does say,
And do not observe it throughout
To find what in it lies.
But presently away do start,
So do Professors too.
But have no taste nor fight in that,
Which is Vision so new.
But O spirit shall here more sing,
Notwithstanding all those
In reproof and in praises of
The blessed Sharon rose.
And O you sober waiting ones,
Spirit does love to sing,
And to relate here unto you
The matters of your King.
O you dear sober waiting ones,
What fragrancie is here,
For the Box it is opened, and
The Ointment does appear.
And is poured out on you, dear friends,
Who love spirit so plain,
Who has brought here a Psalm this day,
That Is so distinctly framed.
O now, O now behold this love,
And more of it still crave,
That so you may see more of him
That this choice spirit gave.
O it will tell you more dear souls,
If that you will hither come,
Therefore be sure you prize and love
The high and precious Son.
O then let heart think so, and say,
It is most sweet and true,
And he shall more allure you still,
And thus your joys renew.
Oh pray the glorious God you may
Have a sight of his grace,
In its original and rise,
Even in election face.
O this is a sweet lovely shine,
A sight that is very high,
O it is in Original,
It Is in Eternity.
O heaven it is opened,
Poor souls, O will you come,
O the clouds they are past away,
Will you behold the Son.
This is a day of loves free grace,
A day of its bright rays.
A day wherein it utters much,
What will you to it say.
Will you embrace it, it is sweet,
It is most delicate,
O it will raise you to the Throne,
And unto glory take.
It will open a door that you
May into heaven look,
And you shall taste much sweetness when
You have eaten the book.
O that the Lord would thus appear,
That you these things might see,
And by them be brought forth into
A perfect liberty.
And therefore praise the Lord poor souls,
That has a love so dear
To purge and cleanse thy soul from all
Sin and corruption here.
In such a measure as it shall
Not reign nor overcome
In those that walk with Jesus Christ
The glorious Solomon.
O love, O love thou enterest it,
Go on to do so still,
And in rebellious stubborn ones
Accomplish thy will.
O blessed be the God and King,
For such a day and time,
Wherein he comes forth so choice
With things that are divine.
A day of love to sober ones,
A day of love indeed,
A day wherein you may rejoice,
And with Jesus Christ feed.
A Psalm, a Psalm of love indeed,
That is sent from the King,
A Psalm of love that the spirit
Unto your souls does bring.
A Psalm of love, a lovely Psalm,
That does extol the son,
And does declare the royal grace
That from his love does come.
O what a Psalm shall there be sung,
When dry bones from the grave
Stand up and l^ve before the Lord,
They Will sing a Psalm most brave.
They Will love the Psalm, and O do you
Unto your Children tell
The Psalm, and song that here has been,
Let it in your hearts dwell.
Tell it to enemies and foes,
That do oppose the Lord,
And said it was an empty thing,
Do you these things record.
A Psalm a Psalm of praises
Shall have and enjoy here,
And a Psalm when I do depart,
Which will my soul much cheer.
A Psalm, a Psalm I shall then sing
For the blessed Kings Throne,
And for his Scepter that will not
Refuse me for to own.
That here have been a sign to all,
I suffered much for it,
In obedience to spirits call,
And more I shall sing yet
A sign, a sign to Children,
O that they would it mind,
And it is a sign to enemies,
And they shall it so find,
A sign, a sign to Churches too,
Though they against it throw;
A sign it is to every one,
With love it over flows.
And therefore O Love more come down
In thy sweet harmony,
And let the Nations round about
Delight to hear of thee.
As King, and Priest, and Prophet too,
In thee all does abound,
That has, or is, or shall be here,
In thee its to be found;
And it is a glorious voice of speech,
When that the Lord does speak,
As many waters in the noise
Arises from his seat.
O there the blessed winged ones
Do fly about the Throne,
And sing forth praises unto thee,
And do rejoice to own
Poor creatures, and to be emploid
Swiftly up and down,
Although they always do behold
The high and blessed Crown.
But O it is most bitter, Lord,
To walk on English ground,
Amongst those that so oppose thy truth,
And in error abound,
O it is very sad to me
To go amongst old or young,
That do slight thy most precious things
And say its a mixed tongue.
It is grievous unto my soul
To walk here up and down,
Thou therefore take me up to thee
And let'st me view thy Crown;
And City which shines so rare,
Thy river there is choice,
And there is the Tree of life also,
There I shall hear thy voice.
In the midst of my sorrows here,
These things thou show me,
And they refresh me very much
In my captivity.
O thou, my soul, my soul thou love,
To see him that is fair,
And thou delightest very much
In him that is so rare.
He that John and Ezekiel saw,
Is come down to my sight,
And lifts me up from the grave,
And does renew my life.
Though I be in captivity,
Yet he does make me sing,
And though I often mourn here
Yet I afresh do spring.
O dear Lord, thou open'st to me,
And thou do to me speak,
And thou do call me up to see
The Kings most royal seat:
And Halelujah shall still
Be sung unto the King,
That night and day does here appear,
And such provision bring.
He is the son, O he is all,
Though others do me check,
I have enough in him, O Lord,
And will be at his beck.
All night I will roll in thee,
O thou beloved choice,
Who will fit me for the next day
To declare with loud voice
The movings of the Spirit, when
Thou did creation frame,
For all things were made by thy word
Which quicknedst the same.
My Christ, O I will rest with thee,
That do come to me here,
And does refresh me very much
With thy rich glorious cheer.
And says, O come to me my child;
Love unto thee will talk,
And tell its mind, and it will show
Its pleasant lovely walks.
O come this night and lodge, says God,
O come and rest with me,
And in my bosom thou shall have
A choice felicity.
And let poor souls have much, O Lord,
In the close of this Psalm,
O let them taste of this thy love,
And smell of thy sweet Balm.
O that companions might this night
Also be taken up,
And very much partake of that
Which is salvations cup.
That they may sweetly be with thee,
And in the nightime dark,
Yea, even at midnight enjoy
Something from thy own heart.
O come beloved waiting ones,
Spirit will try you all
Whether your love be bottomed,
Then you will not from it fall.
O Spirit it will try you all
Whether heartily you come,
It is for holiness throughout,
For love unto the Son.
A holy holy Spirit here
Would your poor hearts allure,
It is for holiness, dear souls,
That always shall endure.
You that profess love to spirit,
O let others it know,
And let your conversation
Show forth that it is so.
O show it forth in all you do,
And give glory to him,
That you have seen so often here,
And have so faithful been,
O now dear blessed glorious God,
I Will take what thou do bring,
And it does cheer me very much
That I shall of it sing.
O I will solace with my God
In his bosom so sweet,
O I shall lodge with thee, I know,
And with thy kindness meet.
Comanions will you now go pray
My Christ, thou say also,
That thou will to thy Father pray,
Thou shall be heard I know.
O I must have strength from the Christ,
I am sure thou will it give,
And it is that and that alone
Can make me for to live.
October. 14. 1657.
From Eight of the Clock till about one, there was a Speaking to particular
persons.
BLessed be God that this last night
I could not hear any speak,
Because methought their words were so
Unlike the Eternal seat.
Where I had been whole days and nights,
And heard of mystery choice,
Therefore a burden it now is
To hear another voice.
I have been at thy lovely seat
Where Creation I did see,
Methinks Creation does not look
In that right rich glory.
I have been at thy glorious seat,
I have conversed above,
And therefore now I care not for
Other inferior love,
I could not taste of any thing;
Nothing will now go down,
For I have tasted other meat
In viewing of thy Crown.
I care not for any thing Lord,
I know not what to do,
But when I do come unto thee
My enjoyments are new.
And I do not now care at all
To live upon this earth,
When glory does appear to me
It shows another mirth.
How can I pleased be dear God,
With company below,
When I above have harmony,
With Covenants high glow.
O yesterday Eternity
Had here a lusterous shine,
It showed the Original
In mystery divine.
O here was sung the progress
And walks of that body,
Which was so willing for to come
For sinners here to die.
O thou art glorious, O Christ,
Thou did most bright appear,
Thy love and goodness it did shine
Most pretiously and clear.
O love thou meltest here my heart,
Thou art the only rest,
O thou art as a flame within,
Thy fire it is best.
And now my heart is straightened much
Amongst creatures to go,
Thou have been here so delicate
In thy election show.
O loving God, O loving God,
My heart it does so flame,
It will not be contented till
It enters in thy reign.
O loving God, O loving God,
Thou sweetly do come down,
And give my soul a vision of
Thy most delightful Grown,
Thou call sons and daughters to
Come and behold thy love,
And view it in original,
Which comes from above.
In Original, in Original.
There may you see it souls,
O come read in original book,
For that does it unfold.
Original is opened,
O come that book and view,
That so it may raise up your souls,
In pleasures that are new.
O come, dear souls, O come dear souls,
These rivers they are sweet,
O come delight to swim in them,
Where you may Je us meet.
O it is a love, a love indeed,
A love of life so choice,
It will revive exceeding y
With its pure Gospel-voice.
O do you love the spirits law,
Come view that law of love
Which God and Christ do so much own,
It comes from above.
Dear hearts be sure that you do love,
The high eternal light,
The Son of God which did come down
To thee in darkest night.
And he does now require of thee
A full obedience.
O be sure you embrace his Law,
And do not start from hence.
For Christ he dearly loves thy soul,
Therefore to him re^i^e,
And that is all that he of thee
For his love does require:
O love spirit for it is pure,
And it will make th^^ shine,
O do you take delight in it,
For it is most divine.
O love the Law O love the Law
Of life that is so pure,
O it is a most blessed Law,
It always shall endure.
O love the Law, O love it dear,
For it is very choice,
A School Master indeed that has
A very teaching voice.
O the Lords choice beloved Saints,
That now lie in the grave,
O they did keep unto thy Law
And counted it most brave.
Thy servants counted it most dear,
And forth King did cry,
O they did testify for thee
With witness very high.
O those dear and choice ones, O Lord,
Against Apostates all
Highly did plead, and longed for
Their ruin and their sall.
These dear ones did not wander from
Thy Gospel Light so pure,
But their obedience unto thee
Did all their life endure.
O they could not be carried from
The high Kings blessed walk;
But O they witnessed for him
And of his Law did talk.
And souls, if you for David are,
And for his English march,
O then do you keep to his Law,
Which is so dear and choice.
If that you be for him and his march,
Do not stray any way,
But O keep to him and his Law
In this backsliding day.
O love the Law of the dear Son,
And resurrection day,
O come to God through his Son,
And then you will obey.
You will then obey the great God
In spirits light so pure,
But if you do leave off this Law,
O you cannot endure.
Original he brings down
Election Book to show,
That so you may here read in it,
And after it may go.
Yesterday in this Book I read
Of Father and of Son,
From which the spirit did proceed,
And now for it I come.
For in Election-Book I read,
And in it saw these three,
In all their workings so distinct,
With pleasant harmony.
O Spirit moved on waters high,
And caused the great depth
For to divide and separate,
That of dry ground bereft.
The Spirit comes from Eternal Word,
It is that breath most choice,
That came forth from the living God,
In his Creation voice.
O I did see Election clear,
All that is wrought in time
Does shine forth in Original,
In its beauty and prime.
And the sun does shine forth in all,
His Image it is sweet,
And does appear in every thing
That does the Father meet.
And Spirit's also at the Throne,
And from thence it does come
For to declarce of Jesus Christ,
Who is the only Son,
Oh! God he is a Spirit, and
Jesus Christ is the same,
And Spirit takes of God and Christ,
And declares in his name.
O what a glorious one is this!
O what a lovely spirit!
That shines here so pleasantly,
And from them does inherit.
As soon as Spirit it does move,
The Sea quickly appears,
O the waters are cleansed and
The mud it does cashire.
The spirit gathers the waters,
And then in creeks about,
And in channels he sends them forth,
And gives springs throughout.
The Spirit moved the waters, and
The Spirit ordered depths,
The Spirit gathered the Sea;
And the dry ground is left.
The Spirit is very glorious,
And wondrous in all,
And the depths does unto the depths
For his high praises call.
The Spirit shines on waters,
The choice Deity face
Did there appear, and then waters
Did swiftly run apace.
O they do swiftly ebb and flow,
That they may praise throughout,
The sea after its kind does praise,
And the springs round about,
The Spirit moves, and all things then
Do look most sweet and choice,
And all things had its limits set
By the Deities voice.
The Spirit moves on waters and
Then day and night comes forth,
And all things had its due set place,
This is Scriptures report.
O when you see the waters and
When you the Sea behold,
O think upon these movings that
Such mysteries unfold.
O the time comes on apace,
Those that in darkness lie,
Shall be called to wonder at
Thy glorious Spirit high.
The M^rriners that to and fro
So on the seas abound,
Shall take notice of Spirit high,
In its Original Crown.
Those that thus travel in the depth,
And on the waters lay,
Shall then behold the Spirit high,
In its Creation day.
They that do on the waters go,
And the Lords wonders see,
Shall sweetly rejoice and sound forth
The Spirits high glory.
The Spirit moved on the waters,
That there the ships might swim,
That should be made use of after
That fallen man did sin.
The Spirit caused ships to sail,
That Creation might be
The more beheld, and there you may
The Spirits movings see.
He gave wisdom for to build ships,
That his works might appear
In their great choice variety
To man more bright and clear.
And that you might learn the more,
On God in all to look,
And be carried forth unto him
In his Original book.
It is a delicate spirit which
Is in Deity wall,
The spirit it is very good,
It comes from him that is all.
The spirit is Creator too,
And with the word does join,
O the spirit is one also
In Deity divine.
The spirit in Original
Has been with God and Christ,
And also does proceed from them,
And is eternal life.
The spirit on the waters moved,
And great increase did come
Of fishes, which did multiply,
And in the waters swom.
In the waters variety
Of fishes that are great,
And also such as are most sweet
And choice delightful meat.
O what a rare spirit that moved
Thus in Creation time,
A spirit and a lovely one
That is high and sublime.
He made the whale so huge, so high,
And so great every way,
So strong that it is as a King
In the waters to sway.
Nothing can there before it stand,
But it wheels all about,
And has a perfect victory
In the Ocean throughout.
O the whale overturns ships,
It is a mighty thing
That thus the greatest vessels split,
And to destruction bring.
A glorious spirit breathed forth
On the waters, that it
Should thus contain the mighty whale
That there as King does sit.
For all things are by spirit made,
It ordered the whole,
And gave command to every thing
In the Creation mold.
O Job when that thou came out,
Thou shall sing of the whale,
O thou shall show him as a King
Over fishes and scale.
And thou that to God spakest of it,
When thou shall see sons reign,
Upon thy standing tising feet
Thou will admire the whale.
Thou will admire the spirit
In its Creation rare,
Which so disposed every thing,
None can to it compare.
The spirit also it did make
The little fishes small,
And his great power and his love
Does sweetly shine in all.
O the spirits moving was rare
In all his fiery race,
In every thing it did appear
On the Creation face.
But yet those that go on the sea,
Cannot thus sing of thee,
Without the knowledge of the Lord
There is no melody.
But O go to the Mariners,
And lead them to thy sea^,
That they may read the spirits works
In creation complete.
Then when they on the waters go,
They will see spirit there,
And then they will in every thing
Behold the spirit rare.
O go unto the Mariners,
Let them unto flesh die,
And let them relish the spirit,
And Jesus Christ epsy;
O let them follow Jesus Christ
The King of Nations great,
And they shall then give thanks to thee,
And run unto thy seat.
If that poor Mariner were here,
That in prison has been,
Spirit would of the sea and ships
Be talking unto him;
If that that Mariner were here,
The spirit would to him sing,
That sea and ships should be useful
And employed for the King;
O if that Mariner would come,
The spirit would him ask,
Why that he did so often say
Love should abide and last;
O if the prisoners would but mind
What in their bonds they say,
They would act more for Jesus Christ
In this backsliding day;
If that the prisoners did mind this,
They would better fruit bring,
Which should be manisestly seen
To all in every thing.
The spirit is in Creation seen
In every B^^d that sings,
And in each creature that does here
On earth so sweetly spring;
O spirit thou art sweetly seen
In thy creating hour.
In all things that here comes forth
In every plant and flower;
O spirit it sparkels and shines
Forth in the Onix stone,
And in the Berill, O spirit,
It is the rare choice one:
O the spirit shines throughout,
It does most sweetly look,
What a pleasant witness is this,
Wherein so much is put,
Its spirits influence does came
Trees to look fresh and green,
Each little sprig for to have sapp,
Whereon the leaves are seen;
It causes blossoms, and the fruit,
It is from spirits blow,
And his rare workmanship is seen
In each garden below:
The spirit it is greatly seen
In the creation all,
And it is reason that it should
Be at the spirits call;
The spirit also did appear
In threefold council, that
To raise mankind out of the dust,
On his creation sat.
Three is not spoken of before
Nor in this manner named,
But they are clearly mentioned, when
Poor man is to be f^am'd,
That so he might behold them all,
And think on this love well,
Though other creatures had the three
Yet not so visible:
Sure the worlds original cannot
Bring forth such a choice sound,
Lets look up to this diety
For there it does abound;
O it does greatly sparkel there,
But few can it behold,
So as to magnify this love
That does such things unfold;
The honor showed to man is great,
He is pleased above all
For all are subject unto him,
At his command and call;
But when that he was formed and framed,
He had not breath to breath,
But then the Lord did it covay,
And unto him bequeath;
Incomprehensible this love
D^ety breathed in,
This creature whom they had thus framed.
And given life to him:
Most glorious was his state, and seat,
Till that an angel bright
Became a serpent, and did tempt
Him at God, law to smite;
When that they were in Paradise
The serpent to them came,
With his subtle temptations,
And they yield to the same;
The creature had not honor now
In the fields as before,
O he had loft his glory, by
This lustful sinful gore;
When that he was in parad^se,
Obedient to the Lord,
All things submitted unto him,
And sweetly did accord
In a spirit of holiness,
And when that comes again,
The Devil he shall be bound up
In everlasting chain:
In the creation of poor man
How did the spirit shine?
O it was a most royal piece,
That had image divine;
What exellency did appear,
And shine in every thing?
What a choice work-manship was that,
Which from these three did spring?
And when that man did walk about,
And the cattle behold,
And the Birds which so sweetly sing
They did to him unfold
The diety and on the deep,
The spirits breath was choice,
And all the little birds did sing
To man with cheerful voice;
And man's work was more Excellent
And looked pleasantly,
I am delighted very much
To behold this glory;
For he was Lord and master then
And raised over all,
And he most sweetly did rejoice
Before his lust, and fall;
O his countenance it was rare,
His beauty excellent,
His form and fashion, and his grace,
From very high descent;
And for him thou have sweetly brought
A most pleasant Psalm here,
And the Godhead appears in it
Most pretiously and clear;
O spirit thou did move on dust,
O spirit thou did come,
And rear up man, and breath in him
That is the lovely one;
But O when the serpent did tempt,
He was disobedient,
And his image is defaced then
And his glory from him rent;
But notwithstanding this great fall,
He Is raised through the merit
Of thy dear son and by him shall
A glorious seat inherit.
Then in creation of female
Thou took^st his rib, and bone,
And did command a sleep on him
And did thy work alone,
But not a sleep in order to
Ioying in body or mind,
That could not be because it was
The rare perfection time;
It was not a sleep as now we take,
But it was a resting sweet,
And suddenly thou then did make
For him a help most meet;
But why did thou lay him asleep,
O thou did make him see,
That he must not be taken in
To the work of the Three,
He must not so presume and reach,
Though a soul rare and choice,
Yet he must not attempt to join
With the great diety voice;
He is poor dust, and must not be
Taken in council here,
Though he be of a glorious make,
He must not here appear;
The spirit also moved herein,
And opened joints and bone,
And did make up a Curious piece,
Here appeared three in one.
And then the work it was complete,
Meet help to him is left,
That so they might in paradise
Talk in that sweet choice breath.
O then the work it was most pure,
It looked very sweet;
O diety, the Birds of thee
In singing notes did meet,
Birds, Beasts and Plants, all thee did praise
And were useful to him,
In the prime first Creation days,
Before that man did sin.
And the most glorious God desired
But one thing in this seat,
To be reserved for himself
Amongst his gifts so great:
And the Devil begins with that,
And cunningly said it
Was good for them, but his drift was,
Man's innocence to split;
But the spirit, the spirit was,
So choice, so high, and rare,
The serpent could not hit at that
Nor his glory lay bare.
O he could not meedle with that,
But it was above all,
It remained bright, glorious, great,
Though man had such a fall.
The glorious tree, the gooly tree,
The knowledge tree so high,
The fruit that was forbid by God,
The serpent at did fly.
The Devil he did fly at it,
Times at foreknowledg high,
The Bargain it was very great,
And much in it did lie,
The serpent for foreknowledge would,
Readyly part withal,
So he might have an insight there,
He would let all else fall.
The serpent strikes at foreknowledge,
To Children it is dear,
But his destruction is therein,
For to be seen most clear.
The serpent he did come, and does,
With subtilty beguile.
Poor Eve, alas they quickly are,
With subtle mischief foiled.
And when poor man is fallen, he
Is like to one amas'd,
He cannot tell whether to go,
But does about him gase.
For Birds and Beasts all are against
Him, that to him before
Were in subjection, and did yield,
They will not now adore:
Nor he cannot see as before
The paradise sweet shine,
For sin, and Satan had come in,
And spoiled what was divine.
All things do look ghastly, and pale
Upon poor fallen man,
O they do not as heretofore
In full perfection stand,
O they run in the thickets then,
And hide in darkest place,
They are ashamed to appear
Before the Almighties face.
But in the Cool God comes and calls
Adam, where art thou now,
But Adam, was afraid, because
He did to Satan bow:
Adam, what is become of thee,
O what do thou do there
O do thou think from my presence
To hide thee any where:
The serpent has beguiled thee,
And thou do think to hide,
But thou should have been more watchful
Against temptations side,
Satan did make thee to believe,
That thou should be as God,
But thou shall find he did deceive,
And meet a scourging rod.
But O foreknowledge now steps in,
And for poor man does plead,
And discovers election,
And show that Christ must bleed.
O foreknowledge that does step in,
And th^n the Serpent dies,
And he does wallow in the dust,
And on the ground does lie.
He, that once was an Angel bright,
Is cast down to the Lake,
And never shall with fallen man
Be partaker of Grace.
And the original of Sin
And Satan did take place,
And so alas did bring about
Man's fall and his disgrace.
Foreknowledge brings election out,
And does declare that love,
And shows from Eternity
What comes from above.
For in original is set
Gods foreknowledge so great,
And O let not free willers now
Account of this a cheat.
It Is true the Serpent chased man
From out the glorious place,
But O the Serpent could not spoil
His interest in Grace.
For the Eternal Son steps in
Unto poor fallen man,
And he is recovered again
By a most royal hand.
According unto foreknowledge
And election indeed,
The Lord does presently provide
This choice and precious seed.
This flourishing foreknowledge tree,
In despite of all soes,
Does still endure and stand upright,
And it shall ever grow.
It Is the foreknowledge of a God,
It looks most fresh and green,
O it appears most pleasantly,
There Is nothing like it seen.
But Satan labors many ways,
At foreknowledge to strike,
And to eclipse its glory and
Says it was from foresight
Of something that poor man should do,
That it was from sight of work,
And thus the Devils instruments
Do at foreknowledge pluck.
But the Tree of foreknowledge stood
In an abiding ground,
And there is no other cause for it,
But what in God is found.
The Tree of knowledge it did stand
In Paradise, and there
Is also put the flaming sword,
Which is exceeding rare.
The flaming sword is also there,
That it might run through all
That would be striking at this Tree,
Thinking to make it fall.
But who so strikes at this Tree,
The flaming sword shall cut,
And those that cavil at Spirit
Shall surely have the hurt.
Some in this Generation,
Pretending much for Grace,
Say it was for all, not only some,
But this does it deface.
And though that Christ does with sweet voice
Call to rebellious ones,
And they are left without excuse,
None can come to the Throne,
But such as in foreknowledge were,
O this is glorious Grace,
The Deity does here shine forth
In its election face.
O the Son he does magnify
The Fathers grace and love,
But yet the Son he does not spoil
Foreknowledge from above.
And poor Souls you will not then think
Upon free will so much,
If you go forth to Jesus Christ,
And have redemptions touch.
O look unto the son of God,
Fo he foreknowledg knew
And all the glorious things that so
From Gods election grew,
And when souls rightly take a view,
O it is through Christ's light,
Else its dangerous to look
On that which is so bright:
The sword that was about the tree,
It had a lovely flame,
It did sorround foreknowledg tree
That nothing could it stain,
The very spirit that did move
In first creation so,
It also does defend this tree
Against the evil foe;
And O this glorious tree is-kept
Though Babylon would have slain,
And has indea voured by all means
This flaming love to stain;
But O the sword is about it,
And this your faith shall see,
And therefore look up to the Lord
For there is victory,
And do not fly against spirit,
Which does so much appear
For the truths of the diety
And would draw your souls near;
Ezekiell he was taken up,
And did in vision bright,
Behold the glorious Diety,
He had a precious sight
Of several winged creatures, when
God thus did him up call,
For then most sweetly he beheld
The Original of all:
The spirits work in creation,
In rivers he is there,
And in dry land he does appear;
In all things very rare;
And father, and sons light and love
Is in a l that was made,
And the spirit, these three are one
In all that then was said:
Then in redemption spirit comes,
And thereof he do h talk
And shows the blessed royal King
In his redemption walk;
The spirit of the son has told
And of the Father dear,
And to the creature does apply;
And brings this love near:
The spirit reads original book,
Not for himself alone,
But to apply redemption
To the poor weeping one,
And therefore love poor souls to drink
Of spirits wine so choice,
For that will cleanse your souls from sin,
And free you from all dross:
Come O you sober waiting ones,
You love to drink herein,
And for to taste of Jesus Christ
Who frees the soul from sin;
Come waiting souls, come what say you
Unto this wine so sweet,
What say you to the clusters that
You did from Canaan meet;
But O the scorner comes and laughs,
At Canaans clusters great,
But the children do not delight
To sit in scorners seat;
But O come forth you sober ones,
And eat of the choice grape,
For the juce is refreshing sweet
And after more you will gape;
O come you sincere sober ones,
For its prepared for you,
For they are relished and touched
But by a very few;
Poor hearts you that do sigh and groan,
Gome drink of spirits wine,
It will carry to Jesus Chrst,
And will your souls refine;
O poor hearts methinks you should not
Hear those would make you fly
From the sweet teachings of this love,
Which in your hearts shall lie,
O the anointings of the Lord
Will make your souls to shine,
O do not speak against that which
Is so high and sublime;
It does not favor any one,
It is not from the brain,
But it does search the heart throughout
And it does try the reins;
O pray souls receive the spirit
For it is very high,
It did create and form all things
That you do here esple;
O pray souls love the spirit which
Also does show the son,
In his redemption work so great,
For from him he does come,
And O what does the spirit show
Of his anointing great,
And what will not anointing do
Before the highest seat;
Pray waiting hearts drink of this wine,
It shall with you remain,
It will not only fly to head,
But run in every vein;
O come poor unbeleeving ones,
Look to this royal grace,
And see the cups that overflow
They Will fill your soul apace:
O Christ he minds the trembling heart,
And the wounded spirit,
That takes what does issue forth
From his victorious merit;
Would you poor hearts have a spring time
O come you and wait here,
For the cold winter it is gone
And summer does appear;
O come you drooping hearts, O come,
For spirit does love still
To speak particularly to you,
Your empty souls to fill;
It is the public spirit souls
And it does love to show
The large and royal grace that does
To sinners overflow;
And the book of original
These things does tell and bring,
Poor souls, O come and read in it
The matters of your King.
O Christ when he did rise from grave,
With Godhead spirit high,
He minded Mary's tears, and then
Did pity weeping eye;
It was his work for to ascend,
And swiftly go to throne;
Yet when a weeping Mary comes,
He Will not leave her alone
Without some words of comfort, O
He must to Mary talk,
And also send to Brethren.
Who likewise love his walk
She cries Rabbony, and would touch,
But prithee Mary stay,
For I am not ascended yet
Says he, but go that way;
He did not stay, I cant now talk;
But wipes away her tears,
And speaks most kindly unto her,
That so she might not fear;
O what a glorious Christ is this,
That does say I am he,
And what'a bright and flaming love,
May poor hearts in him see.
While she was weeping he do h speak,
And unto her does come,
While you have ears on cheeks for him,
He will bring comfort home
Unto your soul, and you shall drink,
And have your fill of love;
And it shall rise up to a flame,
And carry you above
O come then and do you behold
The King in his high reign,
In full complete persection, and
See all the enemies slain:
This you shall see, therefore rejoice:
In your Savior so dear;
Behold the love of him that will
Wipe away all your tear ^.
Therefore O Souls come unto him,
Believe he is your rest,
And love the Gospel very dear,
And covenant that is best;
And be sure you observe what does
Come from the King of Kings,
And let none lead your souls away
From that which comfort brings:
But O observe the true Gospel,
For it is choice indeed,
And it is very glorious
For the soul on to seed;
How sweetly died Sillinghast
In Gospel sound so choice,
And O how much did his soul prize
Thee in new covenant voice:
O he was faithful unto thee,
And much comfort did bring
To thine, how sweet's his rising day
That kept close to the King,
And did not from new covenant start,
Love swallowed up his prime,
And he did witness very high
To truth of latter time;
O how sweetly did Pend^rvis
Take farewell of all here.
And was faithful in testimony
And in obedience dear;
He stood unto new covenant,
Did not to Sinai run,
Nor to stone-tables for a rule,
But did to Zion come;
O how lovely and sweet was he,
Who morned for David's spirit,
Who did so much desire his march
That he might his inherit;
His soul was sad, and could not bear
Any should take in hand,
What was against the blessed son
For whom he up did stand;
O his name and fame it shall live
From first unto the last,
He greatly loved thee and did
To thy commands stand fast,
And every where did speak for thee,
His heart was on a flame;
O he was faithful unto Christ,
And to his blessed reign,
And O how sweetly did he speak
Forth in the spirits sound
Of the commands of Jesus Christ
When he went on this ground;
He owned the poorest one that he
Did look upon as thine,
And did praise Jesus Christ in all
O his soul did incline
Unto thy glorious Kingdom, and
Did long for thy high throne,
And to behold thy blessed face
That art the smiting stone;
How sweetly did he set thee forth,
And how did he oppose
Those that were not for Christ, that is
The only Sharon rose;
He did not care what any said,
But kept unto record,
This is the evil of this day
Souls do go from the Lord;
But sweet were the commands of Christ,
Unto this servant dear,
They were to him most pure, and bright,
And did refresh and cheer;
O what a glorious frame is this,
Sure it is very safe,
And it wi l certainly lead souls
In to the straightest gate,
O lovely died Pendarvis
Lovely was his renown,
And every way most precious,
And blessed is his Crown;
He was lovely in principles,
Lovely in Doctrine,
And lovely in his practice too
Which beautified him:
Blessed was he in holiness
Which did so sweetly shine
In his most humble holy look
With countenance divine;
He died unto yoke fellow
And unto children dear,
And early in the morning he
Approches the throne near:
That so for dear Jerusalem
He might with face on ground
Go weep, and mourn unto the Lord
Who will by such be found;
He waked early that he might
For poor Jerusalem go
Unto the throne, and there he wept
That others did not so;
O this beloved blessed one
Did long so after thee,
And thou did Crown his days, and life
With spirits melody;
And he was not rash with his tongue,
But he did speak most meek,
He was a choice and lovely one,
He was a dilicate sheep;
And a sweet pleasant Psalm thou have
Sent for this lovely one,
Who did delight in Jesus Christ
More then in any one:
O that others did also mind
This example so rare,
That they might go forth after him
That is so bright and fair,
And my heart does to children go,
I would ly at thy feet,
And beseech thee to carry them
Unto thy Gospel fear;
O I could even die O Lord
That they might live to thee
And embrace that pure Gospel law
Where is such melody;
O that those poor souls would now come
From that which is so dark,
From Sina's law which even does
Shoot like a peitcing dart;
O it does shoot against thee O Lord,
How can I it embrace,
For it shoots against the covenant
Which has such glorious grace;
Though thy Gospell-commands I love
And fellowship would crave,
Yet I had rather go to earth
And ly in the deep Grave,
Then to enjoy it with those, that
Do so love Sina's walk,
How can I embrace it with them
That for that covenant talk;
O I cannot have fellowship
Though I in it delight,
For so to hear my Savior wronged
Is grievous in my sight;
But O I would have fellowship
With faithful real spirits,
According to a Gospel rule
Through my dear Saviors merits;
O fellowship is sweet indeed
And will be till I die,
And then a witness you shall have
To it that is more high.
With testimony against those
That are apostates great,
And against Seperates also,
That do love Sina's seat;
I matter not what any say,
Who will not these things own,
For I shall still sing more of it
And for thy reigning throne:
O lovely spirit thou art best,
That comes down to me
And carries forth my soul in this
Choice, and sweet harmony;
O rare spirit, O thou art rare
That shines forth so pure,
Thou art the high and blessed one
That shall allwaies endure;
O spirit, thou art very choice,
That Joel said before
Should after Christ come down, and it
Is come, and shall much more;
O rare spirit thou art the same
Come to Disciples then,
And did seal unto Joels word,
For after ages men,
But not to seal, and terminate
It only unto them,
But the first fruits it was of that
Shall be to latter men.
And thy handmaids were promised
Much of that spirit choice,
And it is, and it shall come forth
In a rare singing voice.
It shall be poured all along,
While that the ages last,
But Antichristian Rabby's do
Endeavor this to blast
The glorious choice spirit, Souls,
O the annointings sweet,
They Will make you sing, and quickly lay
All others at your feet,
The spirits sweet anointings, souls,
O what will they not do,
Go to the Lord, for the spirit
In his discoveries new;
A holy spirit, souls, it is,
Which you have seen this day,
And the spirit has come forth here,
In the Creation way.
O love spirit, which does so come
In first Creation sound,
And see the progress he has made,
And none shull you confound.
O in the days of vision
You shall spirit behold,
And be affected much with him
That shines more than Gold.
He is a glorious royal one,
He is eternal Light,
It is reason you should wait on him
That is so high and bright.
O come dear souls come and try it,
See if it be not more
Than any spirit that is on earth,
Or has been heretofore.
O come poor souls, come peevish ones,
O come and now draw near,
And tell me, souls, if any do
So gloriously appear.
O come and try the spirit, souls,
What can you to it say,
It is the voice of God indeed,
In resurrection way.
O come and try the spirit, souls,
And see what it does bring,
Is not the messenger most sweet
That comes from the King.
O come and try the spirit spirit souls,
O it is full of love,
And it is sent forth unto you,
It comes from above.
O come and try the spirit then,
O brethren come try,
Come sisters, and say what you do
In the spirit epsy.
O come and view the spirit, souls,
And hear what it does speak,
And see the Scepters glory which
Comes from royal seat.
The spirit it is bold and high,
The spirit will not creep,
It is the spirit of Nobles,
You must unto it seek,
It is the only Conqueror,
What will you try withal,
For he does come with the sure word,
And for it he does call.
The spirit sometimes has the noise
Of wings, which up do fly,
And sounds sweetly in his voice,
O come the spirit try.
And thus it was in vision, when
Ezekiel up was took,
The spirit in appearances
Most variously does look
But that this glory he might bear,
God bid him at the roll,
And it was sweetness unto him,
And God did more unfold.
O ear the roll, Ezekiel eat,
Vision shall make thee glow,
And thou shall be strengthened; and shall
With new discoveries go.
What living Creatures did he see,
And Cherubins behold,
O what appearances had he,
And what did God unfold.
O go Ezekiel, now discover,
Tell Israel my mind,
But O you will be sure in them
Much rebellion to find.
Says God unto the Prophet, and
He was obedient,
And he declared the mind of him
From whom he was forth sent;
O souls, now will you keep to him
That is so high above,
And march unto his Kingdom, though
You meet with many a Rub.
O it is time to act for him,
And for Jerusalem wall,
For men they are grown impudent,
And would fain make it fall,
O therefore call poor lost ones in,
Call the perversest men,
And let them view this City Lord,
And show grace unto them.
O call rebellious ones, O Lord,
Call the most stubborn spirit,
And spirit them for to come forth,
And robbers disinherit.
Convince the Treacherous, O God,
O their danger so great,
And let not them longer stand our,
But come unto this seat.
The spirit greatly for them mourns,
And Scripture does bring here,
Therefore if any comes to try,
They must with it appear.
The spirit it is noble, and
Will not use poll cies,
But comes in mystery, most choice,
And from men's reason shes.
It comes in a plain form of speech,
Though its voice be divine,
It does not love confusion,
But gently tells its mind.
The Scripture is a lovely piece,
Spirit discovers the same,
And it does witness of all three
In the choice diety name,
And the Lord now has sent it forth,
In prayer that is most choice,
And in a spirit of prophecye,
And in a sweet singing voice.
This spirit has kept this poor one
Amidst many attempts,
From the Devil and World too,
And not only from thence.
But from Church Members, and their rage
O Lord is very great,
But O let them repent of it,
And be humbled at thy seat,
And notwithstanding all thou do,
Keep me from any harm,
For I am kept enclosed in
Thy most beloved arm.
I care not to go up and down,
For it sadness does bring,
But I love to behold thy Crown,
And of thy Throne to sing,
O I do love to come to thee,
Though others do revile,
And it is not all any can do
That shall my comforts foil.
And when my Father speaks to me,
I do on all things then
Look as unworthy for to be
Compared unto him.
My God, my God, O thou art he
That do so take my heart,
O I see all to be in thee;
O here is the lovely part,
Come souls taste of his royalty,
With a believing ^ouch,
The spirit loves you dearly, souls,
And that you should take much.
O he does love the weary soul,
And he will give it ease,
Let nothing therefore you affright,
But labor him to please.
It Is a most holy, choice spirit,
What say you Brethren,
And sisters, have you had enough;
O he will more to you send,
If still you are hungring for that
Which is so sweet and choice,
You shall from the Original,
Hear more of the sweet voice;
It is the spirit of Nobles,
A princely spirit indeed,
Art thou willing it to'embrace,
It will supply thy need.
Souls here is meat and drink indeed,
If once you taste of it,
You will not relish any thing,
For nothing else will fit,
And the spirit it will teach you
For to own it aright,
And to pass through all scorns, for
The true and only Light.
O therefore come and learn of it,
And to all things else die,
And be contented to loose all
For this sweet Harmony.
O my dear brethren, will you
For ever with it close?
And the spirit will more and more
In it your hearts compose.
O brethren pray, that so the Lord
May make you steadfast stand,
And continue faithful to him,
In this backsliding Land.
O pray to him that still he may
More powerings give here,
And make you more and more relish
This sweet refreshing cheer.
O brethren and sisters dear,
To morrow will you come
And hear what is declared, by
The spirit of the Son.
And O companions, will you now
Meditate on these things,
O that hey might digested be,
And in you live and spring;
And do you praise the glorious God,
O praise him night and day,
And I will also praise his name,
And rest with him always.
5. November 1657. about 2. of the Clock.
The matter before I writ (as I was told) was touching the Saints suffering and
Martyrdom etc. and so it appears by what leads to a speaking of the prepared
body.
O Lord my God, O thou art much
In remembering thine here,
Of those times. which are past and gone
And of so many years,
What do thou fetch past ages back,
And years unto this time?
O do thou bring thy Martyrs here
To sight, since Christ first wind?
O must thousands of years declare
What by thee has been done,
In despite of all Enemies
To glorify the Son.
O living Creatures Wings must mount,
O their wings must soar high,
And greatly thou must praised be,
By those that thee epsy;
Living Creatures about the Throne
Must needs praise him that comes,
And takes the body from his Father,
And as a Lamb brings down,
O living Creatures, this must needs
Such a true Lamb admire,
And they must fall down before him
That does so much retire;
Elders with living Creatures shall
Then compass thy Throne round,
Then Jews and Gentiles shall be brought
Upon salvation ground;
Patriarch Jews shall come in number
Which is complete and true,
And Apostle Gentiles shall then speak
For the high number new.
Patriarch number shall be joined
With Apostles so sweet,
And both shall make up one number,
High sublime, and complete;
No toe shall wanting be though it
Appear so little and low,
Yet all shall be brought unto that
Which as Lambs Body shall go,
This Body Patriarchs shall show,
And Apostles shall declare;
O complete is that Body, it
Is glorious and rare.
A body that Father prepared
To suffer for elect,
And so bring forth Creation which,
Sin has so much here checked,
And a Body must thus declare,
And for poor sinners show,
Therefore this Body must not want
A finger nor a toe;
For the Body Father sent down,
Which was Virgin body pure,
It was complete from head to foot,
This body shall endure.
This body the Father sent out,
It was prepared of old,
And came forth in sweet Virgin state,
Though laid in manger mold.
This prepared body, dear God,
It was complete and choice,
And thou did send it forth in time,
With a choice Virgin voice.
This body in Virginity
Takes up its lodge therein,
Though it comes from the mighty throne,
Virgin womb must it bring.
O what a glorious body's this
That from eternity sprung,
And did declare Virginity
To the rebellious Sons.
A glorious body it was, when
With Father it did lodge,
And a glorious body when that it
In Virgin had refuge.
When in womb, and in birth, O it
Had there no bloody gore,
A Virgin pure, white, and clean, and
Such as nere was before.
A Virgin clean, a glorious state
That was brought forth thus here,
O it was of a glorious make,
And without filth appeared.
But a most glorious Son, O God,
Provided in body to come,
And though an Infant, yet it was
A pure Virgin white one.
And no cry was found in his mouth,
No sin that did make cry,
But O the glorious Son did come
Not with such sinful cry.
A blessed body God prepared,
A body free from all,
From sin, from filth, from lust, from fear,
When forth to manger called;
A body, and prepared indeed,
So glorious and so bright,
Who had no voice against Herod, though
He against him did fight.
A glorious body that came forth
In a choice mystery,
A delicate one, that was most fair,
And did not in blood lie,
A delicate rare Child was Jesus
And he looked fair at first,
And no washing he needed, for
He had no sinful lust.
A glorious body, a glorious Child,
That did not whimpering speak,
But O delicate countenance
Was upon that slain sheep,
Most delicate when it was in womb,
And when it in manger lay,
And when on the Cross, and in grave,
Nothing took it away.
A rare Body was Jesus Christ,
In all his passages here,
And a glorious body he is, in
His intercession dear.
A body that God did appoint,
The Mediator to,
A body to suffer for sin,
And to make old things new.
A body, and a body brought,
For poor ones to admire,
And O let souls advance him, and
Still unto him retire.
O this body pleases my soul,
It is not so with you two,
Then praise is unto spirits Psalm
That brings this body new.
The Scripture shows this body bright,
And Spirit brings a Psalm,
Then poor hearts why are you troubled
For such a double arm,
Of a Body the Psalm sings now,
Which from the grave was brought,
O don't then cry up other things
Which is a mixed draught.
But come and praise the Psalm that brings
The whole body so choice,
For Christ he is the first, and is
Second Resurrection voice.
Pray be not displeased at the Psalm,
And say it is mixed here,
Because the body of Jesus Christ,
So prepared does draw near.
Pray do not bring your argument
Against Christ but to him come,
For you must bend and bow to him
That is the only Son:
And if spirit this body brings,
O eat and take your fill,
And do not so oppose what the
Spirit so sweetly brings.
Learn of the Apostles, learn of them,
Which of spirit so did write,
And O do not reject it when
It comes down in sight.
See what report that it does make
Of Jesus and his Crown,
And if so then, O brethren,
Leave not though some do frown.
For Spirit Christ does say it will
Take of his and show you,
O do not refuse offers of
Christ's dispensations new.
Brethren O be faithful to Christ,
You profess him to love,
O then give up your selves when that
He comes thus from above.
Brethren you say that you love Christ.
Pray then let it appear,
And don't object against that which,
Does draw his body near.
If the prepared body will ride
Upon an asses colt,
O do not say it is not the King,
And so from him revolt.
For although the King is upon
A mean low kicking Colt,
Yet he is King, and does need that
His glory to unfold;
Christ chooses poor low and mean things
Lay's aside Rabies skill,
And sends for the poor asses colt
All bosting for to kill.
Christ needs poor things because great ones
So much do him prescribe,
Christ will not give them the glory
That in him wo'not confide,
Christ needs poor things to show spirit,
Which is so high in power,
Because the wise will not embrace
It in his way and bour.
But they mix some of their own clay,
And of their puddle here,
With that which is holy droppings,
And from him does appear.
O Christ does come in such a way,
And in such mystery that
Most say O it is a foolish King,
That lays his honor flat.
What a King, and ride on asses colt,
When that it is so small,
O sure this is not the great King,
Who is the only all,
But Christ minds not the scoffers, nor
For scorners does he care,
But he does call for the poor ass,
And rides his journey rare.
How ere he comes, be glad if he
Will set you on your feet,
If that he will instruct you how
You may the Savior meet:
This body as the Father sends,
Be sure him so to take,
As he wa kes with despised ones,
And with the poor does eat,
And is filling their Vials, with
His odours most complete,
The Lord Jesus is that body,
Which took so low a seat.
O can you the Psalm understand,
It is brought by a plain mouth,
And it will please God if you take
It, in its degrees throughout;
Then observe the Psalm of degrees
Before you away do go,
Or else you will it greatly blame,
And surely have a blow.
Therefore O now, take in the Psalm
In its high and low degree,
That brings a body so prepared,
O that you might it see.
Do you then beg Faith from on high,
From the most blessed seat,
That you may see that body, which
In glory is complete,
And was so, before thus he came,
He did all things epsy,
A body prepared, a body
With glorious Deity.
But yet not as Beaumont reports,
For he does allegorize,
The body was with Deity,
But not as he describes.
The body prepared before time,
Was in the deities sight;
But notionises of the body,
They do not speak aright.
They spoil great mysteries because,
They cannot bring them out;
But by an allegory, or by
A high speculative mouth;
But O true crucified Christ,
Teaches us mysteries here,
And O he brings down a Psalm,
Which is most pure and clear:
A glorious body Christ needs must be,
Who takes in threefold light,
Who takes in one and three also,
Even the Godhead might:
That must all glorious be,
Who takes in Heaven and Earth,
Sea Rivers and all Creatures so,
From him they issue forth:
That must a glorious body be.
Who takes in light and all,
And has Stars Sun and Element,
Within his Diety Wall,
That must a glorious body be,
That takes in every plant,
That takes the whole Creation in
To its high blessed mount.
That must a glorious body be,
To whom living creatures so bow,
And unto whom Elders fall down,
And Deity allow.
That must a glorious body be,
Where all Israel sits down,
And where those that are grafted in,
Receive the blessed Crown.
That must a glorious body be,
Wherein all do so shine,
And the first and last does appear,
And have deliverance time.
O that body, and that alone,
There is none like to it,
A very glorious body prepared,
Upon Almighties seat:
A very glorious body souls,
Have you such Sermons had,
That of prepared body speaks,
Who is with glory clad.
The spirit in a Sermon-Psalm
Of Christ's body so choice,
Does here come forth, O therefore hear
This sweet and precious voice.
In all ages some Saints they have,
For this body been slain,
The Patriarchs and Apostles have,
With their blood it maintained.
O they fall down before the throne,
Before this body choice,
And sing to him as Creator,
With Haleluja voice.
O they do sing salvation to,
The Lamb that stood so slain,
And in his office as a Lamb,
They do him there maintain.
A Lambs bowed to, when he is seen,
In the Diety so great,
To have fellowship, and to come,
And appear on that seat,
And they fall down before the Lamb,
Because they honor must give,
Unto the worthy one who does,
Make poor fallen ones to live.
They all fall down before the Lamb,
To honor his dignity high,
And the great power that he had,
The seals for to make fly.
They must honor the Lamb for he,
And only he could break,
And open the fast sealed book,
And lead up poor low sheep.
All must fall down before the Lamb,
Though he look so slain,
Yet, O great was the work he did,
And none can it defame.
A Lamb although that he does stand,
So upon the slain ground,
Yet a Lamb on a throne to whom,
Such praises did abound.
Yet he does appear as a Lamb,
When in office he comes,
And when he is to reed the Book,
He must speak with Lambs Tongue,
When reading the Book he comes forth,
As a Lamb that was slain;
But yet the breaking of the Seal,
Requires Lions Reign,
The breaking of the seals must have,
The Lions power and strength,
And then the Book it must be read,
With lovely voice at length;
When Lion has broken the seals,
The Lamb does read it plain;
Before whom all those do fall down,
That are the Kings own train,
The Cherubs, Seraphims, living creatures,
And the elders complete,
They all fall down when the Lamb looks,
From his high throne and seat,
A very glorious body to whom,
Living Creatures so bend;
And to whom elders with loud voice,
Such praises do surrend,
A very glorious body though,
It stood like poor slain Lamb;
Yet in perfection it appears,
To strike down Babylon,
A Lamb, and a Lamb with seven Horns,
O what a Lamb so grown,
O its a choice and precious Lamb,
Prepared for the throne,
A Lamb, and a lamb with seven Horns,
O how were all here met.
Seven Candlesticks, seven Lamps choice,
Were all at the Lambs beck,
And he had also seven Stars,
That is so bright a Sun,
O here was perfect number bright,
And all through the Lamb come, Lamps
Seven Horns, seven choice burning
Seven spirits him to attend;
What a number of seven had he,
His stout proud foes to rend.
O John saw Christ in perfection,
In his number complete,
And O the visions which he shows,
Is most lovely and sweet,
A sweet vision of the slain Lamb,
When he is risen in power,
When he had reconciled all,
He then breaks Babylons Tower;
Therefore says he unto Mary,
O do not touch me here;
For I am not yet ascended up,
To draw perfection near.
Don't touch me, for I have not yet,
I have not taken might,
So as to break all enemies;
And give to them a flight;
But now, O now John may touch the Lamb,
When seven Horns do appear,
And when seven eyes do show him Sons,
O John he may draw near,
The Lamb he is complete in all,
He has full Majesty,
Sufficient value for poor ones,
Who do his rich grace see.
The Lamb has Lion strength indeed,
When horns they do come out,
When that his justing power appears,
Against Babylons rout,
And his great strength does then come forth,
To Iudahs root so rare,
And to the branch that then shall call,
His beloved from far,
A glorious Lion, a glorious root,
That out of David springs,
And comes, and has prevailed too;
For victory he brings,
Who could rouse up Judah till that,
This root did spring and grow,
And how could the Tree have come out
If God did not thus blow,
A glorious body for that is,
The Sermon of this day,
To set out the body of Christ,
Though in a singing way;
Yet the Doctrine must proved be,
In the Psalm that is sweet,
O therefore mind the Doctrine,
Which shows Christ complete;
For faith looks not on miracle;
But on the body bright,
And therefore faith does fetch ground from;
What it here brings in sight,
Faith it does go to the body,
That is prepared always,
And fetches power and strength from thence,
All evils to alay.
Faith therefore does not come hither,
To fetch miracle for any;
But faith comes to see and behold,
Prepared body for many,
O faith it comes, and does require,
The body of Christ to behold;
And therefore come dear ones to that,
The which will truth unfold:
Pray dear comers do not desire,
A miracle to have;
But pray come and with faith behold,
Whole Body rise from grave:
Come and behold Christ body souls,
And gaze not on miracle still,
O do not follow him for looks;
That will not your souls fill.
Don't follow miracle bread; here
Is morsels that is more sweet,
The whole body Father prepared,
Walks upon spirits feet;
Pray don't hunger after miracle-Loaves,
For it will not satisfy,
It will not break corruption,
It cannot open your eye.
Pray don't love for miracle bread,
It will not make you strong,
So as to engage against the foe,
And spoil Antichrists throng.
Pray do not come for miracle-bread,
For Christ is risen up,
And spirit brings the whole body,
To give your souls a pluck,
Is not Christ body far more sweet,
Than miracle bread so small;
That satisfies thousands of souls,
And is broken to all.
And this whole body here it comes,
That is more than a Loaf;
Then hearken not to miracles,
Against the spirits vote;
Because the whole body throughout.
And the Father is one,
And it will strengthen to the work,
Of Christ advancing throne.
Is that enough to satisfy,
Instead of miracle here;
Then O come and eat heartily,
To whole body draw near,
Praised be God for the body,
That John did see so clear,
O praises to God night and day,
That this body draws near.
Haleluja, Haleluja for,
That glorious vision high,
And for the breaking up of seals,
Which made sorrow to fly.
Haleluja for the glorious Lamb.
And for his coming down,
And for his blessed, and free grace,
And for his royal Crown.
Haleluja for that the Lamb is,
Unto his children come,
For to take the Book, and read it,
And open the kingdom,
It was a glorious one to John,
That said pray do not weep;
For the Lion he has prevailed,
For his poor, low, lost sheep.
O John you may wipe away tears,
The Lions come with power,
O the root of David appears,
In thy sad weeping hope;
John do not weep for thou shall know,
Great mysteries to come.
For thou are greatly beloved by,
The blessed glorious Son;
John do not weep, for now thou shall
In bright vision behold
The things that afterward shall come,
Unto the latter fold.
Come and behold great glorious things,
That have a sparkling shine,
Look into Heaven and behold;
What is bright and divine.
O do not John lie down and weep,
Thou must stand up and go,
And look that so thou may see,
The enemies overthrow.
John do not weep but cast thy eyes,
Unto the glorious throne,
And view what from thence does come forth,
From the Eternal one.
O then John had a lovely sight,
That was most bright and fair,
And spirit does invite you to
Come to this body rare.
The spirit it does lead you to,
The things that are most high,
To him that came from Heaven to Earth,
And in the grave did lie,
Souls come to the whole body and
Do you not stick at part,
Feed not on little morsels when,
All is sent to your heart.
Souls spirit always does and must,
For the whole body speak,
That it may carry souls unto
Christ on his lovely seat.
Souls come and take the body that,
Was crucified for sin.
And O be much in love with him,
That is the blessed King,
A glorious body souls indeed,
On him pray fix your eyes,
For this prepared body does,
All things in it comprise.
Apply this doctrine dear souls,
Be sure you take it all,
For it will steel and strengthen you,
And keep you from a fall.
O you will be carried on sweetly,
And be comforted herein,
But O there is nothing else that can
Free your poor souls from sin.
The Spirit comes and does show it,
So sweetly here prepared,
That so you may freely come eat,
Of this most dilicate cheer.
This Psalm, O it is very sweet,
Of the great King of Kings,
For O the matter is the same,
Of which the Harpers sing.
The Harpers they do sing of thee,
Harpers as witnesses come,
And O the glorious Trumpets do
Sound of the lovely Son.
Blessed be God that does provide,
Such a body complete,
That does cause his for to believe,
Against the erroneous seat.
Blessed be God for that body,
That will overcome all,
By his great mighty power and strength,
They shall before him fall.
Blessed be God for that body
Prepared which Doctors so speak,
That he might confute many and
Show divine wisdom great.
Blessed be God for that body,
That is of noble make,
A prepared Virgin body,
So pure in City, and Gate:
A rare choice workmanship that God,
Prepared for sinners vile,
That he might be their Savior,
And all their evils foyl.
A very rare gift was indeed,
That whole body to me,
And you and every one that comes,
His free grace for to see.
Those that are rich in their conceits,
Cannot this treasure find,
They are not in capacity,
To taste of this sweet wine.
They that do think that they are wise,
And will not here stoop down,
O they cannot see Jesus Christ,
And his high glorious Crown,
They cannot take in this Psalm Lord,
Which here does speak so high,
And does declare such wondrous things,
There Rabbis makes them fly.
O they that come to catch at words,
The Lord catch them in that,
That they may willingly lie down,
Before the spirit flat;
They that do come and do desire,
Something for to catch up,
That they may carry it about,
Lord give their hearts a pluck.
O come unto poor souls, O God,
O overcome their heart,
That they may not against spirit gape,
And from it fling and start.
Lord catch the tatling tongues and break,
Scorners reproaching here,
That so deridingly do speak,
Against what of Spirit appears,
But let Companions see O God,
The body that is prepared,
O let them own a holy Christ,
That is so choice, and rare.
Companions, Christ is sweet this day,
In these his comings down,
In all his glorious victory,
To have his Martyrs famed.
Companions, O how sweet is Christ,
His righteousness is great,
He is a very faithful one,
That sits one royal seat.
O Christ was kind to Patriarchs,
And to Apostles there,
He is kind unto Jew and Gentiles,
Though Anti-christians tear.
He is kind to poor hearts, although
Unbelief would them flay,
Yet Christ he keeps them and does make
Them to observe his way.
Christ must be observed aright,
By those that sing his praise,
Or else they walk not with the Lord,
Though they keep holy days.
If Christ be not observed in all,
Great fault he will with you find,
But O with spirit he does walk,
In his choice rushing wind.
Companions are you pleased with Christ,
And with his doctrine too,
Though it in Psalm be poured forth,
A course that is so new.
Do you praise for Christ doctrine and Psalm,
Which here he does so bring,
O then how greatly you will be,
Revived when spirit does sing.
Has this day to Companions been,
A teaching day most sweet,
Which has so witnessed against
Perjured rebellious seat?
The voices which have gone this day,
Even in their meetings all,
Have not held forth the whole body,
To which spirit does call.
And though that Children have met,
Different from the apostates train,
Yet there meeting is not aright,
Nor of new Covenant strain.
Though Children have met this day,
And great prayer seems to sound,
Yet God does not accept that which
Is not on new Covenant-ground.
O that Children would not so rise,
Against the doctrine sweet,
Which is for the whole body prepared,
To set on royal seat.
O that poor ones would thank spirit,
That in love so does come;
For to overthrow that which is,
Not pleasing to the Son.
Poor hearts, why do you wrangle with me,
Alas what am I herein;
But O you wrangle against him,
That great teachings does bring.
Poor hearts do not wrangle with me,
I am but poor and small,
I cannot answer your wranglings;
But leave it to Christ my all,
I dare not argue with you for,
I shall spoil these high things;
Therefore I do refer you to him,
That most rightly does bring,
A confirmation from his word;
For what the spirit said,
And let thousands come forth to me,
In spirit I Will engage.
I dare not else engage with one,
For that would be too strong;
But in spirit I am confident,
Against a thousand tongues,
O let God put his harp in hand,
Then I Will challenge you all,
And I do know, I shall stand sure,
And you will crumble and fall,
If God does put his harp in hand,
Then no man shall it break.
No weapon formed shall prosper against,
What Christ shows from his seal,
If once that harp be in my hand,
I Will stand against you all;
Do what you can, yet this weapon,
Shall not at any time fall,
The harp, and vial full of odor,
Will make me stand upright;
Then I can challenge all that will,
Come and against me fight.
I fear not for to tell them now,
That I don't matter it,
Though that against the Psalm they speak,
And the instrument would hit.
And O pray let the Rabbis come,
That do the spirit hate;
And let them hear what spirit says,
That speaks at high rate.
Prithy souls come, O let them come,
Entreat them to do so;
That they may hear what spirit says,
That their objections know,
Pray let Court-Chaplains come and know,
Spirit against their Master fights,
And against them who do stand up,
And say its day, when night.
O let Court-Chaplains enter here,
Were there hundreds of that rout,
The spirit here would deal with them,
And show their casting out,
The spirit it would sing to them,
And show their Harlot feasts,
And tell them that the Scepter is,
That Kings that will defeat
Them, O if that such men were here,
The spirit it would preach,
And show forth the great power of him,
That Antichristians hate,
Companions you can witness that,
The spirit is very strong,
And how that it does challenge all,
That its pouring out wrong,
Companions you can witness what
Spirit speaks for Nations King,
And his most royal glory, for
Spirit does of him sing;
Companions dear, Companions dear,
What a glorious time is that,
When that this King with power appears,
To lay his enemies flat;
For O the time is coming that,
The enemy shall know,
That goes securely up and down,
What is the Almighties blow.
The time is coming are you fit
Companions, what do you say;
Can you sing praises unto him;
For this approaching day.
Companions are you strengthened,
For the King to appear;
That you may engage for the King,
And own his latter year.
Companions dear, no matter though,
Others it delusion call,
Yet O do you esteem of that,
Which brings the all of all.
Its no matter though others do,
So much dislike her show;
For they do not her understand,
The Kings hot shining glow.
And therefore say its not spirit,
They cannot see it here;
But if they knew it were the spirit,
They would for it appear,
And thus they do refuse what they,
In prayer have for so been,
Though mercies come unto the door,
They say it is not him.
And thus they did poor hand-maide wrong,
And say, O thou art mad;
It Is no Peter but an Angel,
It Is no earthly clod,
O thou art mad Rhoda,
Unto her they did say;
We cannot believe it is Peter,
Was their words in that day,
And thus they do say in our time,
And count handmaid to speak
From their fancy; but it is that,
Comes from eternal seat;
But what ever that they do say,
Yet Jesus Christ is here,
And our ass-mbling is sweet;
Because he draws near.
The assembling of your selves spirit,
Does not at all deny;
But you are to observe that,
Which is most choice and high,
God loves that Churches should appear,
And meet in his own light;
But O he would not have them for,
His comings down to slight;
Spirits not against assemblies;
But holds them forth most clear.
But O let not assembliss,
Against the spirit appear;
But if you are for assemblies,
From a true real heart,
Then O now assemble for him,
That shouts forth piercing dart,
Against those that do so oppose,
And so reproach and come,
Against those administrations which
Do come forth from the Son.
O dear souls where is it you can learn,
A doctrine more sweet,
O then go forth to Jesus Christ,
And lie down at his feet,
O mind how that the spirit does send,
And show body prepared,
And how it sets forth to Jesus Christ,
Which is so choice and rare.
Companions dear do you always,
Against miracle-mongers speak,
And do you plead for spirit that,
Your joys may be complete,
O do you look for faith the which
In Jesus Christ is found;
And will help their souls in all straights,
For it unbelief drowns.
The spirit unbelief does check,
For it angers the Lord,
It witnesses against what is not,
According to record.
Many time-pleasers are amongst
The union of this day,
And yet they will not suffer that,
The spirit should it gainsay;
But the spirit it will gain say all,
That at this day unite;
Because they do not go the way,
Which in Scripture is right;
But they do cleave unto such things,
As fancy leads unto,
And do despise those things that are,
So glorious and new.
But Christ he does not own union,
Upon the ground men go,
And I am confident hee'r blast,
The union that is so,
O poor prisoners they are mislead,
Because uniting breath,
Upon false grounds is nothing but,
The fancies of their head.
O God has showed us this day,
That all must lie in grave,
And all those things must be laid by,
That men esteemed have.
O who do plead so much for Christ,
As those that unite at this day,
But yet they will not him allow,
To come in his own way.
But let any one come and speak,
A few fair words of thee,
Then presently they will unite,
To show loves victory.
O miserable love is come out,
And does poor Children draw,
And that makes them so fall away,
And to strike at thy Law.
But Apostles shall for Christ unite,
Cherubims and Seraphims high,
And all those unitings that are,
Against him shall fall and dye.
Christ art thou lest to Cherubims,
And to the Seraphims,
And to the holy Heavenly host,
Thou also art their King.
O come, O Cherubims, O come,
King Jesus for to Crown,
Come Seraphims with burning zeal,
For Nations King come down.
O come, come Cherubims, O come
Seraphims with burning Coal,
And O do you appear for him,
And his glory unfold.
Come Seraphim with living Coal,
Poor ones here to rouse up,
That they may appear against Babylon,
And by the roots up pluck.
O Seraphims coal if thou do touch,
They will to thee accord,
And quickly rise for Jesus Christ,
According to his word,
When Scraphims coal poor one does touch,
They quickly will fall down,
In their selves and be ready for
The Lord Jesus to Crown.
When Seraphims coal love blows afresh,
O it will souls inslame,
If they shall not here quiet be,
Till apostates be slain.
When love blows up the altar coal,
And Seraphims forth come,
O then will poor ones be for Christ,
Both in their words and tongue.
It will be a very choice time,
When Seraphims here do fly.
How many will follow the coal,
That will not now rely.
When Seraphims with a live coal,
Does touch Isaiahs tongue,
O he does then stand on his feet,
And for God goes one.
Seraphims hot coal from above,
Makes the heart look up high,
And presently it does go forth,
For Jesus Christ to fly.
For a voice in the coal there does,
As well as in Seraphim come,
For to raise up poor dying hearts,
To declare for the son
To ages of the Mystery,
That from the throne did come,
And to tell them of the living Host which
He saw above the Son.
And his Ministry was most sweet,
For God he did out-goe,
And the glorious power did make him,
For Christ to overflow.
He was desirous that he might,
His Lord Christ much advance,
Therefore with open eye he looks,
When spirit does on him glance.
And now dear souls will you go home,
Will you on these things feed,
O will you then to morrow come,
For more to supply need.
The Lord he has this day prepared,
You for more here I know,
He has brought down his body sweet,
To make your souls to grow:
O pray then call to mind Doctrine,
That holds forth Christ above,
Remember the Doctrine of the psalm,
Against miracle-mongers, that don't it love
Remember the doctrine of the Psalm
Which you have heard this day,
And O remember to apply
It after Spirits way,
That so Satan may not at all
Steal your affections away,
And O dear hearts be careful now
Over matter you pray,
Now Lord this night I Will with thee rest,
I know thou will bring more,
O praised be the Lord, for what
Has come down heretofore,
O praised be the glorious God
For what this day has come:
I will now in thy bosom roll,
Who art the glorious Son.
NOVEMBER the twelfth 1657. about ten of the Clock.
It begun with a speaking touching the faith of NOAH, in building the Ark, and
ABRAHAM in offering his Son, and so went on concerning Faith.
BUt faith is that which pleases God,
He takes his walks therein,
And is above all that men can show
From their own reasonings
In Salvation, and preservation,
And victory throughour,
This faith must rise up to the Lord
To fetch and bring all out.
Faith justifies the will of God,
And the foreknowledge tree,
Faith speaks well of electing love,
Which reason cannot see.
Faith is the very power of God,
And life wherein does lie,
All blessing and all glory, for
It pleases the most high:
O then let all know that the Lord
Will have his will and way,
The which the Scripture does declare,
And must in us bear sway.
Whiles this was uttered. the Quakers being present spoke, but could not
interrupt, for withmore power and swiftness the voice went on as follows.

None can hinder the mighty word
Of the eternal One,
But the Devil he rises up,
And is offended with that tongue,
The which extolls the glorious God,
And of him does declare,
Against that comes his instruments,
For it they cannot bear.
The Devil hates the Spirit should
Exroll the eternal breath,
And that it should advance that God,
Which gives saving health.
The Devil rages at the truth,
At that which is most choice,
To that which is Gods rare workings,
Me sends condemning voice.
The Devil cannot hold his peace
When God is declaring faith
According to election, and
To foreknowledge high sort,
But the Devil greatly does rage,
And his instruments come,
Yet O spirit will sing thy praise,
And extol the high Son,
Though all the powers of hell should rise,
And in their rage come here,
That shall not stand against that faith,
Which shines so bright and clear,
The spirit comes down to slay Devil,
And break his instruments quire,
It is seen forth for to witness
Against thy inward light,
Thou talk of inward light, but O,
For what do thou it bring,
It is to oppose the Lord Jesus,
As Prophet, Priest, and King,
Thy light is not Jehova's light,
It Is not light or the Son,
But it is that Satan has framed
Against the glorious One.
The spirit of truth is for Christ come,
For to exalt his power,
And this does not please the Devil
In this his tempting hour,
But does intage the Devil so,
To plead against the truth,
Which God discovers from above
By his sweet singing Lute,
O do not thou poor man thus chat,
Or for the Devil plead,
When that his Spirit forth is come,
That did for sin so bleed.
Christ bled for sin, O why do thou
For the Devil here so plead,
And stand up and contend for him,
And the Lord Jesus leave.
The Spirit cannot endure that you
Should against the Son go:
And therefore now against thee it comes,
Who art to Christ a foe.
The Spirit is much offended that thou
Do thus his Psalm refuse,
And da'st so boldly plead for that
Which Christ will never use,
The Lord Jesus does love Spirit,
And by his sweet alarm,
He now does witness against thee,
That blows the Devils horn.
The Spirit does blow salvation,
The Spirit for that does come,
To declare against what thou bring'st
To oppose that living Throne.
The Spirit most powerfully comes forth
To give to thee a Check,
It is most Royal, choice and pure,
And does to Christ direct.
The Spirit is a holy one,
And full of purity.
The Spirit that crucifies self
Does give to thee the Lie.
The Spirit it does come from God,
And from the glorious Son,
In these his sweet appearances,
And against thee it comes,
The Spirit of foundation speaks,
Which is of Jasper stone,
And of those bright and living things,
Which are about the Throne.
The Spirit will not let thy rage,
Nor Devil, nor sin take place,
But O the glorious Spirit will
Oppose thee to thy face,
And this Spirit the Lord does own,
And it is not in thy power
For to prevail and batter it
In thy attempting hour,
Though all of you should now oppose
What is so dear and bright,
Yet the Spirit it would declare
Against thy hellish light,
But O man thou art chained fast
To the Devils way and will,
And thou do think Spirit to choke,
But its prevailing still.
It Is not in thy power, nor in
Thousands were they with thee,
Nor in the Devil, nor Hell it self
To spoil this melody;
For Spirit chiesest melody is choice,
It Is glorious and rare,
O Spirits Harmony is sweet,
Nothing can with it compare.
Companions you that love the Lord,
This Spirit does you desire,
From the Devil and his instruments,
Unto him to retire.
Dear hearts keep close unto your God,
And prize his Spirit high,
And though others oppose it, yet
Do you unto it fly.
O do you keep close unto God,
The Devils power is slain,
He nor his instruments cannot
Bring any thing to stain;
For the great God is present here,
In his Psalm that is most sweet,
Be not discouraged because it
Does with objections meet,
But O do thou appear O Lord,
With thy power that is great,
Against those that dare to come forth
To oppose thy Royal seat,
For though objections do arise,
You are strengthened by Christ's hand,
Though they do bring forth Treachery,
Yet through faith you stand.
And have a glorious sight of it,
O it is very sweet,
Dear friends can you rejoice in that
Which others count a cheat,
But Spirit sings victory over
All lies and cheats throughout:
O Spirit, it does sing O Lord
Against the lying mouth.
The Psalm it has a joyful sound,
It victory can sing
Now over the accusing tongue,
And what it forth does bring:
O the Psalm it is very pure,
And to Companions dear,
Because the Lord appears in it,
All Cheaters for to fear,
O thou do bring us to the shore
Where living Creatures be,
And we behold the glory and,
We do thy power see,
O victory I sing O Lord
Against the lying mouth,
O Halleluia I sing,
And victory throughout:
O spirit it is powerful,
In these thy comings down,
O what a mighty royalty
In beholding thy Crown.
O what a Noble King is Christ,
How he appears in sight,
When any opposition comes
Against children to sight.
I was an eye and ear witness to this Psalm against the Quakers, and heard
many of their impudent objections, I shall instance some. The men came in sat
down in the room, at the end of two hours spoke against the truth at the name
of Christ and electing him, then the voice answered their several objections,
which are in the Psalm, they said, we were told she could neither hear nor see,
and yet she answered in words, and names me one in the room, at which they
raged higher, and spoke against the Kingdom truth, but the Lord sent down a
louder voice, that did drown this, and so swift, that the writer could not take
all, but as you may read victory, so I can witness that it had victory over
them, that they were not able to tarry in the room, but went away raging
against the truth in the Psalm pray mark the Psalm, read it again and again,
much encouragement to those that have the truth, at that time to see such a
decision of truth against error.

O what a victory O Lord,
Does from Jesus Christ come.
O God the Father does appear
Most clearly in his Son,
O what a victory O Christ
Does shine forth in thy face,
In thy bright resurrection,
And in thy glorious grace,
Victory over death and sin,
A Royal victory,
By him that now in spirit does
Against the Devil cry.
O what a glorious victory,
God in it does come down,
Against all that Satan can do
His blessed truth to crown,
O what a victory is this,
That God to us does show,
That by the very powers of Hell
Can never have a blow,
A glorious victory indeed,
O souls will you come in,
And close with Jesus Christ this day,
And part with every sin.
Victory, victory I sing
In this triumphing day,
Over the Devil, Hell and Sin,
And fears shall fly away.
When the Spirit is poured out,
O let not children fear,
Although the Devil in his does rage,
And at outgoings tear
The glory of the Lord is here,
O then let Children
Behold his power and Majesty;
And stand in aw of him.
Unto thy children thou will give,
What is to thee most dear,
O thou will show kindness to them,
That unto thee draw near.
O thou art faithful unto them,
They shall with comfort meet,
That ^o keep close to Jesus Christ,
And prize his spirit sweet.
O blessed be the glorious Lord,
He will with us abide,
And will appear against those that do
Against his spirit side:
O blessed be the Lord that does
A victorious Psalm bring,
O praised be that mighty God,
That in Spirit I sing,
Praised be God has so poured,
And so flowed forth here
Against that hellish light that would
Thy own appearance tear,
But O thy children, O Lord,
They shall abide and stand,
And be kept close unto thy word,
By thy outstretched hand.
O thy children have not an ear
To hear their lying tongue,
Thy own children shall not receive
What from hell forth does come:
Thy children shall not embrace
The cheats that go about,
But they shall be kept to the day
Of Redemption throughout.
Thy children are kept so fast
By the power of the Son,
That now they cannot start aside,
Though such enchantments come,
And praised be God for that which
We here, have found this day
Of God, and Jesus Christ which does
In our souls bear sway.
O You are very safe who do
Sit down, and sup with Christ,
Who have his prepared body
So freshly brought in sight,
You have heard of the body which
God prepared for you
To be broken, that still you might
His love afresh still view,
O It Is a Royal body, Friends,
I know you love it dear,
And that you do not at all mind
What against it appears:
O it is a royal body, souls,
What can you of it say,
Have you embraced Jesus Christ
In the Fathers own way.
O see how spirit Jessifres
Against the Devils lies;
O let it therefore teach your souls,
For it more up to rise,
The more you do love God poor souls,
And Jesus Christ do see,
The more you will prize and esteem
Of spirits melody.
O you his beloved children dear,
You should for spirit stand,
You that profess for Jesus Christ,
And for Jerusalems Land,
Give thanks to God that overcame,
Though you so sinful be,
And this very God will appear
Against all Treachery,
And go away you vile ones that
Do so kick against him,
You are defied by spirit and
He manifests your sin:
O go thy way from spirits shine,
Which here appears throughout,
And against thee this day does plead,
And thy deceitful mouth,
But it is not in thy power to break
This pleasant Harmony,
Although thou come with hellish tricks
Against it for to fly.
This Vision was, the night before the Quakers came, showed to her, but she
knew not of their coming, but the Lord did provide for their coming. By this we
understand the rise of them, and in what strength we must encounter with them.

Lord, thou the vision have fulfilled,
That I this night did see;
For thou shewedst a grievous thing,
That did come to bite me
Thou shewedst a Cocatrice to me,
And it was very high,
And it had teeth that were most sharp,
And against me it did she,
Its teeth were like to iron,
Even like iron strong,
And a fiery eye I did behold,
As it did pass along,
It first came in most cunningly,
And a while it did walk,
But at last it did open mouth,
And against me did talk:
O what a terrible sight dear Lord,
Did I in night behold,
But then came power from above,
And of it I did take hold.
It was a very grievous sight
Unto my fleshly pare,
But O the Lord did then appear,
And strengthened my heart;
For O thou did bring forth O Lord
The other night a Vision sweet,
For a Lamb then there did appear
That stood slain for the sheep:
O Lion di^st show a Lamb to me,
With pleasant countenance.
That did appear most lovely slain,
And did my soul advance
To him, and this did strengthen me;
For the slain Lamb to stand,
That is so faithful unto me
In his protecting hand,
The one night a Lamb I did behold,
The other a Coccatrice,
And the former did strengthen me;
For it could do no less.
O the Lamb it did stand by me,
I knew not what it did mean,
Till that the Coccatrice appeared,
And strove to make me lean.
O I did see a Lamb so stand
With countenance most bright,
But did not know the meaning till
The other appeared in sight,
And this Lamb my soul must extol,
In a triumphing voice,
And O its this thou can not bear,
Though it be sweet and choice,
God has sent forth his Spirit in power
The God head to maintain,
And the body that is prepared
Against thy critical brain.
O the choice faith of Gods elect,
The Devil much does spite,
And election he cannot endure,
But against it does sight.
The Devil does election hate,
Against foreknowledge flies,
But the Spirit according to Scripture does
Give him and thee the lie,
But O election love is sweet,
O it is choice and pure,
O Faith must needs lay hold on that,
That thou can not endure;
For through electing love poor man,
Was set upon his feet,
And was made to revive again,
Through election sweet,
And through grace was strengthened,
And grew and flourished brave,
And Christ delighted for to come,
And bring this through his grave;
And though poor man had many a foe,
Against him for to fight,
Yet that faith arises to God,
That comes from his Almight,
For so the Gospel does declare,
Where Christ sweedy appears,
And that word, brings forth from him,
By which the soul draws near.
O faith is that the which the Lord
Greatly embraces still,
O It is that which sweetly does
Your soul with good things fill,
Faith works by love, and love in faith
O companions is dear,
O what an Harmony is that,
Which herein does appear?
Faith it does justify the Soul,
So as to condemn sin,
And faith it purifies the heart,
The which Christ down does bring.
Faith it does justify the soul,
It does it in Christ's way,
He is the object of that faith,
Which in true ones bears sway.
Faith it does justify from sin,
And it is very pure,
Faith it commends the Love of God,
And shall for Christ endure,
O Faith it is prevailing, for
Victory is found therein,
That nothing can prevail against,
For it is from the King,
How excellent is faith O Souls,
O what of it have you,
That so you may most cheerfully
Embrace the Lord anew,
O embrace Jesus Christ O Souls,
With a most royal faith,
For O it is this will learn you
To live at a high rate,
O faith it is most precious,
This day it does appear,
For the Devil he cannot bear
When it does shine forth clear,
O Souls, now what of faith have you,
That has been spoke of here,
And has so mightily shined forth,
Against such fi^thy gear,
If thy pen has written it down,
I shall be very glad,
Because the power of God this day,
Greatly the Psalm has clad.
If thy pen has writ the swift Psalm,
I shall praise the most high;
For it is worthy of thy pen
Thy Spirit it did fly,
That so the earth may hear of it
And that it may appear
What a mighty Spirit God did send,
While vile ones did draw near.
It will make all true hearts rejoice,
And you chiefly I know,
That have been witnesses to it,
When it did overflow,
A very blessed Psalm, O souls,
That had victory at hand,
To sing and triumph when that they
The Spirit did withstand.
O will not this establish you
In love to Spirits light,
That has so great power and strength
With the Devil to fight.
O if the Spirit remains in you,
It will bear rule indeed,
And it will raise you unto him,
That here for sin did bleed,
Will you remember such a time,
When any would you fear,
How that the glorious Spirit did
All oppositions tear.
A condemning power Spirit has
Received against all,
That do oppose and strike against
The high Salvation wall.
Here is as much as could be taken concerning the Quakers, the Psalm being so
very swift, it could not all be writ.

Feb. 7. 1657.
CHrist person showed what Angels spoke
To those dear ones of old,
His glorious person did show sorth
The figures, and unfold
The Tipes this branch from Jacob came,
That John did see so bright,
Which did open the seized book,
And his tears from him wipe.
The person of Christ Jacob did see
When he traveled on the way,
He saw the Heavens opened.
And was comforted in that day.
He saw the royal L^dder there,
Whereon divin nature walked,
Whereon the Angels loved to look,
And of it to Jacob talked.
Jacob must see God, but he could
Not come him for to reach,
Till the ladder was laid to Earth,
Wherein Christ body was preached;
And carried up his eyes to behold
And see the glory high,
Which did greatly revive Jacob,
And quickened much his eye.
The person of Christ did make out
All that old Israel saw,
The Altar and the Tabernacle,
The person of Christ convey;
The person of Christ did show forth the
Rare mercy sea: so choice,
Which was in the Arc, and he holds out
Clea ly in Gospel voice
Its meaning, he brought clearer light,
He comes in rich array
With girdle of Gold about his paps,
Which John saw in his day.
The person of Christ brought forth free grace,
Which was discovered then,
When that his person did up rise
Amongst the sons of men.
The person of Christ showed the High Priest
In his great office choice,
And in the privileges he had
To utter forth his voice.
The person of Christ showed the High Priest
In all his rich array,
And fully declares the deliverance,
And the redemprion day.
The person of Christ declares Tabernacle
In all its ove-layings with Gold,
For he did shine brighter than it,
And more glory unsold.
The person of Christ did show forth
Solomon's royal seat,
And sweetly discovered every Tipe,
And preached them at high rate:
His person did not allegorize them,
As notional brains do,
As it they were not real truths,
But inward fancies new.
But the person of Christ breaks notions,
And does not truths so take,
And speaks not like the Notionist,
But after true Records rate.
For the person of Christ the Father entrust
With the Records throughout,
And he is faithful to his God,
And speaks plainly of them out.
The person of Christ is entrusted with
The Record of Diety,
And he does strike down all this way
Of men's false allegory.
The person of Christ shows forth all
Is in him whom is chief,
The Comprehender of the whole,
Where only is relief:
And none but God-man comprehends
The types and figures all,
For they did but him represent,
Whom is the all in all.
O allegorizers they abuse
The whole Record throughour,
And greatly does wrong the God-man,
Through whom all does come out;
O they confound the whole Scripture,
And makes it an allegory,
And so does depart from the truth,
And against Gods wisdom fly.
But glorious God-man does declare,
All was in him at first,
Though in a manger low and poor,
Nothing could wrong or hurt.
Shepherds saw glory round about,
A marvelous great shine,
And Angels were the messengers
To discover Christ high time.
To show his birth his lovely birth,
As to a manger state,
Yet accompanied with a glorious Host
As Angels from the high gate:
From the gate of power, that lovely gate,
From which the Angels came,
He is surrounded with glory
More bright than any flame.
Angels John saw about Lamb Throne,
So did the Shepherd here
Behold Angels servants to Christ,
Though in a manger laid.
John saw multitude of Angels about
God, and also the Lamb,
So Shepherds saw the messengers
Being tidings of Christ to Land.
Angels did not only delight to speak
For the Son, when as a King,
But when he as an infant came,
They do attend on him.
Angels did not only honor Christ when
He on white horse did ride,
But when he was in manger laid,
They appeared on his side.
Angels did not only give their voice
When Christ was in glorious height,
But when he as a servant came,
They showed forth great mirth.
They honor Christ as the royal one,
For whom spirit does appear,
And declares him unto the World
In his rich Gospel dear.
So that not only Angels but spirit
Declares the precious Son,
The spirit that moved upon waters,
For him does sweetly come.
The spirit comes forth for the Son,
And honors his birth,
The spirit divided the waters.
And ordered their depth and height.
The spirit did for the Son come forth,
And his over-shadowing show,
The spirit that divided water,
That are in depth below.
The StarsSun and Moon and every thing
That looks so clear and bright,
The spirit did sweetly declare,
Also the precious light.
He does to sinners sweetly show
The rich eternal light,
Light when all in dark chaos lay,
And also brings in sight.
The Son that is light, and in his birth
Did bring rate gales of wind,
And does declare the glorious King
That looks so divine.
And spirit comes forth in his high works
To poor and feeb^e things,
And thus he does to all declare
The royal glorious King.
That so all may see that God he does
Thus that no flash may boast,
But that all may give honor to
Him that is Lord of Host.
The spirit loves for to make use of
The poor low foolish things,
That so he might thereby exilt
The Son as King of Kings.
The spirit loves to show himself
To those are very poor,
That he may confound learned Doctors,
And break the scarlet whore.
Spirit brings to such the birth of Christ,
The birth of the noble King,
That so they may rejoice in his reign,
And of his triumph sing.
Praised be God for his spirit,
Ahat honors poor handmaids vile,
Who were in the first transgression,
And did the Creation spoil.
Praised be God for the spirit
Which looks on fallen ones,
Tnd comes to the chiefest of sinners
With tidings of Salvation.
Praised be God that has so much
Honored his dear Son,
And has given him such high respect,
When he in manger did come.
A birth, a joyful birth indeed,
Was Christ though at first small,
Yet O he was most great and high,
And glorious through all.
The spirit brought him amongst Doctors,
And the spirit for him did speak,
And consuted the Rabbis then,
And his Fathers wisdom preached,
He had no guilt nor filth at all,
Yet suffered for sin,
A holy just person he was
From the very first conceiving.
But yet in bloody filthy gore,
He appeared for thee and me,
For sinners and rebels he did dye,
And brought felicity.
For sinners which foreknowledge did
Call for to see free grace,
Discovered in his precious blood,
Which quickens apace.
God as well as man, and man as God,
In one person did dwell,
And this strikes down that Harmony
That cannot sing such a knel.
But part Christ and under vallew him,
And take him by peece-meals,
Therefore they so run astray, and
Like drunkards from it reele,
For Christ he is true God and man,
He so was in first state,
He so appeared in resurrection
At high Ascentions rate,
And so living creatures him behold,
Else they could not have worshipped the Lamb,
For it is Idolatry to worship that
Which is a very man.
But God-man may be worshipped,
And living creatures so did,
And Elders clod in white worshipped
The Lamb in the Godhead.
O high death it was honorable,
And had a lovely Crown,
That none could take away from him,
Though they did on him flown.
But yet they could not have their wills,
They would have spoiled him quite,
But not a bone of him must be broke,
That was preached in true light.
Joseph of old the brethren did
So despise and abuse.
And Joseph here does follow Christ,
And his Cross not refuse.
Joseph must follow Jesus, and
He must the Cross embrace,
He waited for the Kingdom, and
Showed it in his race,
Joseph rich Joseph now draws near
To honor the Cross there,
To take in all the types of that man,
Which showed the how so rare.
Joseph of Arimethea did
In the time of the Cross appear.
Though Simon a Cirenian was,
Compelled to bear it there.
A garden enclosed is prepared
For the sweet crucified Son,
A place where he delighted in
Lillies to walk among.
A garden, a rich garden's prepared.
A garden well enclosed,
That no swines might there rent and tear
Where lay the Sharon rose.
A garden enclosed for Christ body,
That no Bulls of Bashan might tear,
Nor any goring may come in,
Or rending there appear.
A garden enclosed for the body
Of our Savior dear.
Whom in garden so loved to walk,
And always to appear.
Though a Preacher of grace to all
To leave without excuse,
Yet O he rests in his garden,
There to him have refuge.
In a garden, a rich garden,
A suitable garden indeed,
Was this most precious body laid,
Which for sinners did bleed.
A garden a rich garden which
Had all complete about,
The wall, the door, the trees, and plants,
And every thing throughout.
A garden, where new sepulcher was,
His body in did ly,
Which was so pure so perfect and
So full of fragrancie.
A new sepulcher where none was laid,
The lovely body must have,
To show he would make all things new,
When that he rise from grave.
A sepulcher where no bone or scul
For this rare imbalmed body
Is prepared, from whence he must
Rise, and mount up on high.
A new sepulcher he was laid in,
To show the Kings honor great,
That died to take away sin,
He must have all new and complete.
And this is that Lion the which
Ezekiel in vision did see,
It is the Lamb so pure and white,
Which was slain for thee and me,
This body it was high and great,
And had a glorious rise,
And this represents those that also
Shall from him obtain life
According to the will of God,
And the most glorious Son,
And the spirit for all the three
Are seen in Salvation.
Many they say Christ is the Son
As to justification,
But as to sanctification they do
Deny the righteous One.
They therefore are to be reproved,
As slighters of the Son,
And as underminers of what,
For Jehova did come.
And spirit reproves Rabbis also,
The gross and the refined,
For they are also of those that
Do si ly ones beguile.
Though Rabbis say we have left sure word,
Yet they shall know ere long,
That spirit does preach the Gospel
Forth with the soundest tongue.
Though Rabbis fall off from the Lamb
That is most pure and clean,
Yet they shall see it is the spirit of power
Which on our souls do erne.
Alas poor Rabbis you are not
Like unto those of old,
For they were not so lifted up
Above Christ precious fold.
O people are deluded and
They have been many a year,
Ere since Antichrist come on the stage,
They have been beguiled every where.
Though old Dr. Apostles preached,
And Christ himself did learn,
Yet O they are besotted with
Antichrist stinking leven.
Though Christ speaks of latter days,
Wherein he would his spirit pour,
In such choice great variety;
They Will not believe it, in its hour.
And Christ says that before it shall come
Lyin words and many a cheat,
Against the spirit and the Son,
And his most glorious seat.
And they do say how shall we know
Between true and the false,
But God he sends his spirit forth
For to show what is dross.
And true spirit does take in Scripture,
By faith no allegories,
And it does show forth Jesus Christ,
In's birth, death and his rise.
And the spirit it shows forth Christ,
In his offices and we may see,
The three in one and one in three
In divine diety.
The spirit showed the true God,
In true man here to dwell,
And thus showed the choice rare one
Through forth the joyful knel.
The spirit showed the figures,
And all the choice rare tipes,
And the sweet emblems which before
Did come for Jesus Christ.
And it showed that Christ is enjoyed
By the indwelling spirit,
By its witness and Testimony,
Unto the Godheads merit.
True spirit does show that Christ is enjoyed
By a sweet lively faith,
The which comes from the Son of God,
And is no tattle and prate.
True spirit shows when Christ is enjoyed,
By faith we then up rise
To the pleasure of God in Christ,
And appear holy in his eyes.
True spirit shows when Christ's enjoyed,
The soul is justified and sanctified too,
And that it goes to him alone
For Conversation new.
True spirit leads forth unto Christ,
And then to be baptized,
Not as notionist say it is all in spirit,
And plain Scripture despise.
But true spirits honors the Son,
And his out goings too,
It honors the head, and all that he
Would have his members do.
True spirit don't bring head without members,
Nor head and members without a way
Wherein they sweetly together may talk
Of the rich Ascension day.
But true spirit takes head and members,
And shows Christ lovely way,
And gives direction how they should
Act toward him in this day.
Spirit shows forth Christ and his way,
How they should act and speak,
And discovers that worship which
Their Souls should undertake.
Companions forsake not the assembly
Of Saints, it is most dear,
But seek it in the way of Christ,
Which most lovely does appear.
Companions don't deny fellowship,
Nor the ordinances sweet,
If that you do spirit will reprove,
And tell you you embrace a cheat.
But Companions witness to ordinances,
And to true fellowship,
For Jesus Christ is held forth there
Before him a garden complete.
Companions you may take this comfort
From Christ Doctrine this day,
That you have a good conscience though
Other make of you a prey.
Companions this doctrine exhorts you
To walk cheerfully along,
That you may honor the spirit,
And grow for Christ more strong.
Companions be exhorted now,
Always to watch and pray,
That so you may hold forth spirit
Most lively in your way.
Companions be exhorted to
Cleave unto Spirits Psalm;
Which is so full of doctrine
That will our poor hearts warm.
Companions be exhorted to esteem,
This doctrine in a Psalms;
Because it is of our David's love,
And shows forth Solomon's arm.
Companions be exhorted to
Trust in your power high;
For assistance when so many do
Against the truth so fly,
Dear companions we exhorted are,
To depart from consusions all
And every principle and practice,
That does new covenant inthrall.
Companions we are exhorted to,
Praise the new covenant high
Because our dear Savior did once
So willingly for us die.
That so we may not account low,
Nor bring objections against that,
But keep close to refurrection,
Which will lay all enemies flat;
Companions, we thus exhorted are,
That none may take away our Crown,
The which we do enjoy in this,
Upon true Paradise ground;
O Companions, we are exhorted,
That none may rob us here
Of the rare white stone, and new name,
Which so precious does appear;
Companions the time of love is sweet,
In paradise pure ground,
O it does smell most delicate.
Let us it compassround;
Let us compass the Tabernacle!
Where the golden Pot of Manna stands,
Which will fill, and nourish our souls,
In journying to the pleasant land:
O we shall see our Aarons rod,
And delight in its buddings there,
In its coming forth against the foe
It will all enemies tear;
Companions, the white stone looks bright,
It is a lovely one,
It is elect, choice, and precious,
Lets go unto this stone;
O friends, let us follow the starr,
That leads up to the Throne,
Which is that lovely spirit, for which
We have sighed and groaned;
A beloved star, dear Companions,
A glorious star indeed,
Which the Father has bestowed on us
With which he does us feed;
O let us dearly prise that star
That leads unto the King,
Let us follow it allwaies
For it will thither bring;
The star conducted the wise men,
But not Herod, though he
Said where is the Babe, i will worship him,
I Will also go and se:
But the Lord God he does discover
Such in there practice still,
For though he said i will worship him,
It was that he might him kill.
Companions, let us keep our eye
Still fixed on the son,
And let us prise him very high
How ever he does come;
Converse with the spirit in Scripture,
That right models you may know,
Be ashamed of what you have done amiss,
And he will the pattern show;
We shall have direction and guide
Both what to do and say,
In all our practices throughout
In this the latter day;
We shall be ready to receive
Of our Lord, when that we
Are made ashamed of our ways
We shall his glory see;
When we are troubled at our ways,
We shall an assembly be,
And not depart at all from that
Which is felicity.
At the foot of Christ it is good to be
In this confused day,
Wherein so many rear up things,
That are after their own way.
And then we shall know where he feeds,
And what does please the Son,
And where he does lead forth his flock,
When unto him we come.
O tell us thou whom our souls loves,
How and where we shall go,
O says the spouse where is thy flock,
Teach me that I may know.
She runs to Christ her beloved,
To show her his right way,
And O she says tell me my love,
Let Us know it in this day.
And she says tell, O tell me you,
Whom my soul loves dear,
Where thou feedest in the noon time,
Shepherds put me to fear.
O tell me, says the spouse, O my Shepher'd,
My love tell me where thou feeds,
O set me in a right fellowship way,
Do thou supply my need.
For I would not go to other teacher,
But to him whom so lovely appear,
Tell me O says the spouse tell me,
Thou whom my soul loves dear.
Where the only seeding place is,
For I would thither run,
And be sound feeding with my love,
And my dear Solomon,
Tell me says the spouse, O tell me my Love
On whem I feed always,
For I cannot have pleasure till I come
To see those happy days.
Tell me says the spouse, Love where thou feeds
For I cannot absent be,
But must go where my Solomon seeds,
I love him so to see.
Tell me says the spouse where thou feedest,
For I do thee esteem,
And herefore O I would always
On thee my Solomon lean,
O tell me says the spouse my Love,
Or I shall else find chat,
O I cannot sustained be,
But in thy bosom and lap.
Tell me says the spouse where that thou feed'st,
That I may go thither now
In this time of the Wilderness,
When so many would me bow.
O tell me says the spouse to Christ
Where is thy feeding place,
For I cannot rest till that I
Behold my Solomon's face.
Tell me says the spouse, Where thou feedest
For thou art my delight,
I cannot rest or sleep till that
Thou teach me true light.
Thou have looked in at the window,
And thy fingers did drop,
O tell me where thou feed'st my love
That has such lovely locks.
O tell me where thou feed'st my Love,
That makes the Lillies grow,
And causes the Pomgarnets to bud,
And spices to over flow.
O tell me says the spouse to Christ,
Where thou wisdom do so show,
That thither I may follow thee,
And with thy flock may go.
O tell me where thou feedest that so
I may foxes escape,
That so do spoil the tender Vine,
And deflower the grape.
O tell me where thou feed'st that so,
No foxes forth may come,
To hinder or for to deceive,
And keep from Solomon.
O tell me where thou feed'st my Love,
For thou have taken my heart,
O bring me into thy Chambers,
Let me enjoy that part.
Of inward close Communion,
Let me with thee remain,
And hide me in thy secret place,
When I to thee complain,
Thy fellowships they are most sweet,
And do delight my soul,
Therefore said she show me my love,
Do thou thy truths unfold.
O therefore come my Love do thou,
Show unto me those things,
That golden chain of fellowship,
Do you instruction bring.
O come and do you show to me
What will make my soul to sing,
Show to me Scripture fellowship
That will reviving bring.
If thou know not if thou can tell,
And art unraveled quite,
O come i will show thee fellowship
In this bewildered night.
If thou know not my spouse, but art
Laid level to the ground,
O come and I will show to thee
My fellowships choice Crown.
If that thou do not know but art
Stripped of thy own things,
O prithee then come to thy Love,
He will right fellowship bring.
If that thou do not know but art
Lying at thy Lords feet,
O come and he will show to thee
A fellowship most sweet.
If that thou know not come and thou
Shall have a sight so bright,
As will make thee from all things else
To take a speedy flight.
If thou do no^ know, O then come,
The Lord does call for thee,
Toge acquaintance where thou may
Have pleasant harmony.
And if that thou alone my spouse,
Wilt thus for me remain,
Pass by the Shepherds that do tear,
And against thee complain.
If that thou would know where I feed,
If thou inquirest the way.
Go by the foot st^ps of the flock,
And with them make thy stay,
And do thou come form every thing,
All mixtures that there be,
Go by the foot steps of he flock,
And come and feed with me.
This is the resurrection day,
Wherein Christ did appear,
But Mary thinks it is the Gardener
That unto her drew near.
Mary was in the garden where Jesus lay,
That body undefiled,
Which with resurrection glory rise,
Appeared and on her ^miled.
But she at first did not discern,
But said Sir if thou can tell
Who has taken away this blessed body
Such news would please me well.
If thou will tell me where he is,
I shall very thankful be,
For I long to see his countenance,
In risen rich glory
But then Christ did her heart inflame,
For Mary he does say,
She understand him presently,
And believed his day.
Rabbon^, Lord, and Master dear,
My heart is touched with thee,
For thou art my beloved Choice,
And my mistake I see.
The mighty Lord he does make choice
Of poor weak ones in all.
Both to declare his birth and he
Them to his grave does call.
To see his resurrection,
That they might show it out,
For to declare his mighty work
He takes the feeble mouth.
O resurrection love is that,
Of which spirit delights to sing,
And it does most sweetly appear
In honor of the King.
The doctrine is very sweet,
Of resurrection grace,
It does lead forth to Jesus Christ,
And shows the Sons face.
It ^aith go teach, and then baptize,
In the name of the Son,
Go preach the gospel, and then say,
They must to Baptism come;
Go teach them, and when they do know
And believe one the Son,
Let them enjoy the privilege
That does in Baptism come;
Go preach, go and disciple them,
Let them see the love of Christ,
In that sweet administration
Both in his death and rise;
So teach, that they may learn,
To know Baptism sweet,
Being plunged in the water,
Even from head to feet:
Go preach, go and disciple them,
O let them Baptism know;
O let the poor heathen behold,
My love in Gospel glow;
Confirm and establish it,
By authority divine,
That it may serve for pattern
Unto the latter time,
And as the law of Moses was
Confirmed by miracle and sign,
I must in answer unto that,
Confirm in Gospel time;
I will confirm the Gospel,
And the doctrine of grace,
And the doctrine of Baptism
By miracle in their race;
By the Apostles I Will confirm
With testimony high,
For opposition it will come
And Babylon against it fly,
This Gospel has confirmed been
With signs and miracles, so,
That none can overcome, although
They do against it go,
Though Antichrist began to rise
Long since, and housands bring,
Something against it, yet they cannot
Conquer the blessed King;
O the doctrine of the Apostles,
Has been declared to you,
Who are baptized in Jesus Christ
And see his death so new;
The doctrine of the Apostles,
Has been held forth very clear
To you by the spirit of the Son
And you have for it appeared;
The doctrine and application.
It has been opened quite,
And manifested unto you
Exceeding dear and bright;
The Apostles rule has been declared
Wherein poor ones should walk,
Which Jesus Christ would have you know
In thought, in deed, and talk;
O then dear ones, do you follow
This Gospel which is pure,
And prise the Apostles doctrine,
Which always shall endure;
It was confirmed by miracles,
And wonders which were great,
By that mighty powerful spirit,
Which gave it forth complete;
O prise the Apostles doctrine,
It Antchrist throws down,
And it exalts Jesus Christ,
And his most blessed Crown;
Practice the Apostles doctrine,
Faith and Baptism, they did preach,
And afterward, you see that they
After true fellowship did reach:
Repent and be Baptil'd, said they,
For remission of sin,
Into the name of Jesus Christ,
Which does salvation bring;
Repent, and be Baptized, and then
Walk you in fellowship,
For unto all his ordinances
You ought for to submit;
He will show you his administrations
Most purely and complete,
That are ashamed of their ways
And inquite for his seat;
O mind the Apostles doctrine,
And do not you unite
To any thing but what it does
Call you to and invite;
It is the ancient blessed rule,
And it lays all things flat
That does not conform to it;
O hearken unto that:
And when the glorious one does come
And join to the soul with power,
It straight conforms to a rule,
And submits in that hour;
It does lay hold on him by faith,
And to a rule does stand,
It challenges all that does oppose
His royal sweet command;
It does not walk with subtilitie,
Or in a mixed way,
But it keeps very close to him,
And on his word does stay,
After Baptism Scripture does show
And sweetly teach the rest,
And leads forth to the whole worship,
Where his do feed and rest;
For the word brings the soul unto
Conformity in every thing,
That there may be compleatness in
The service of the King.
Not in a confused or mixed way,
Or an erroneous spirit,
But after the way of Jesus Christ,
Purchased by his merit;
They will not only turn from
Apostasy so vile,
But even from all things that do
The new choice covenant spoil;
The Apostles doctrine will instruct
And reach in every thing,
And it will also lead from that
Which does displease the King;
O Faith and Baptism, it is
A doctrine very sweet
To those that do love Jesus Christ,
And are his obedient sheep;
This is not against fellowship,
But for assembling
According to a Gospel rule,
Which is pleasing to him;
And O such fellowship is sweet
That is one a right ground,
O do not rest content, till you
Have such true fellowship found;
O such a fellowship is sweet,
And clad in rich array,
It Is such a fellowship, O Lord,
We long for in this day:
O such a fellowship is choice
That does not commandments break,
O let us not be like to them
That love a mixed seat,
The law of the Son it is sweet,
Keep his commands in mind
In his death and resurrection
And look unto that time.
His death and Burial is seen
In water, bread and wine
Holds forth his body and his blood
And keeps it fresh in mind.
And when it is received by faith
It does great comfort bring,
And strengthens us in our walk,
And converse with the King.
O its a lovely and pure Christ
That was so offered,
Let Us fetch strength from his flesh and blood
Draw virtue from our head.
O blessed be the glorious Lord,
That to us so does come,
And shows his power abundantly,
To every poor one.
A lovely spirit Christ has caused,
To come in this our day
To show to us that Scripture rule,
In our souls must bare sway.
Dear Christ thy spirit is very sweet,
He love to take of thine
And for to show it unto us,
And to declare thy mind.
Dear Christ thou have a rare cure, friend
That will not silent be,
But takes of thine as thou have sed,
And shows thy melody.
O praised be Christ that does pour
Such a sweet spirit down,
That slayes Antichrists in word and works,
In the Scepter and his Crown.
After this there was praying very largely.

The Evening Psalm.
PRaise the Lord all that is in earth,
And that in heaven appear;
Praise God Sea, River, and each spring,
For Lions Jubely year.
O deep, praise ye the Lord always,
With singings that are new
O Element praise the living God;
Come stars and join thereto.
Praise God created Sun, and Moon,
Praise God the Elements all,
For glorious things of his City is spoke,
And all his Jasper wall.
Praise God, Angels, and Cherubims
Sound forth Halelluja voice,
Yea flying Seraphins come and fetch
Altar coal to burn up dross;
Praise God Cattle one a Thousand hills,
For that redemption work,
Which will deliver you from bondage
And unto freedom pluck;
Praise God you little Birds, and all
Give thanks and blessings also,
Unto the rare God-man whom came,
And did redemption show;
Give thanks O Trees, Herbs, Plants, and Flowers
All after your kind shall praise
The lovely Lamb for his dying
To purchase such rare days;
Companions, can you praise which the
Multitude John did see
Of all tongues, Nations, and Kindred
That about the throne be:
John saw a great multitude, that he
Was not able to number there,
And they out of all Nations came,
And praised the Lamb rare.
Companions, the multitude John saw,
Sprang from the number twelve,
A great many from that number
Appeared from the Kings Helm;
The 144 thousand, which
By 12 was reckoned up,
They are a multitude for the King
To give Nations a pluck:
Companions, will you go with them,
Will you praise with that number
That so their faith, and prayer, and seal,
May be in England as loud thunder;
Companious, go and rest with him
That is raised so high,
Take up your lodge in his bosom
That for your sins did die;
Companions, feed on this doctrine,
Which has been very sweet,
For it has come dropping down, from
The Sons most blessed seat.
Companions, you are blessed here,
Therefore let your souls praise
And rejoice in the living God,
Whom gives forth such days;
And little ones that absent be,
Have a blessing from Love
All children that lodge in foreknowledge
Christ will exalt above:
Children, babes, sucklings he will bless,
And will great kindness show,
Though for the present they languish,
He will show love I know;
O the Lord bless you every way,
Strangers examine your ends,
Examine that so you may enjoy
The blessings that he sends;
Strangers examine whether you
Come fancy for to please,
Or to hear, that so you may practice
That which the King does please;
You do not meet with any thing here
That Ordinances deny,
But opposes the filth of sin
That is odious in his Eye;
Comers, what do you come for this day;
O poor hearts, that you might find
Such a discovery, as may make you
Depart from an Erroneous mind;
The spirit it is a sober spirit
In word, in life and all,
And the spirit requires such,
And does them to worship call;
Now I will sweetly roll my self
In his most lovely breast,
And do you go return praise,
And in him take your rest.
A Hymme comparing David's Sling-stone and the
Stone in Daniel.
OH King David do thou appear,
Let thy greatness be seen;
O come and publish forth thy name
O show thy high sublime:
King David who shall valourous be,
Against all evil ones;
Come bend thy bow, shoot thy arrows,
O let off thy Cannons.
King David is the mighty one,
The great Prince of all sure;
He it is which shall abide,
And evermore endure;
The Goliath can David slay,
Nothing can him affright,
Because he is the only one,
He is the Antitype:
King David's fling and stone shall come,
And through Goliath go,
Which will break the Philistims down,
And give a deadly blow;
King David is so royal, and
So great and rich, doubtless
That they who stand for him, shall be
In every thing here blessed:
They that for King David will speak,
They shall not losers be,
For he will give to them great things,
Much their eyes shall see;
The stone through enemies it does go,
And break their Camps so great,
It makes the whole body of foes
Utterly here to splits
The stone when that it does plerce
And cast Goliath down,
Then all the other soldiery;
Are scattered in every Town;
And this will the stone surely do
Within the English soil,
It will come forth and wound the foes
That will their Camps then spoil;
The little stone out of the Brook
Shall sure be taken up,
And through the sling it shall forth fly,
Proud boasters down to pluck;
The stone, though it be small, yet it is
A smooth stone which will fly,
So that none can escape its stroke,
For 'twill make all foes die;
Though a little stone, yet it does grow
Into a Mountain great,
Which will overtop all Mountains
And their forces defeat:
Though a stone, yet such a mighty stone
No weight can it compare;
It falls so weighty on proud men,
It does ten thousands tear;
Though a little stone, yet it will last
And sure it will prevail:
'Twill break the Castles and the Mounts,
And open Prison goals;
Though a little stone, it will command
The Towns both far and nigh,
It will draw up Jordan Rivers,
And also make them dry;
Though a little stone, yet it will sure,
Jerico wa^ls break and lay,
And batter al^ Fortifications
That rise up in this day.
Though a ittle stone it will consume
And cast Egyptians down.
'I will ruin all Gomorrahs and
All Sodoms filthy towns.
Though a little stone, yet it will wound,
And cast Leviathans lows
O 'twill break all the jaws of those
Who do it from them throw.
Though a little stone, 'twill break down Towns
And ruin Islands too,
And go through all Europe also,
Every Tyrant to undo.
Though a little stone, it is so frim,
There Is none can make a flaw,
No defilement can reach the stone,
Which will bring to its bar.
It will indeed pass sentence on
The perjured sort of men,
And vow-breakers 'twill utterly slay,
And undo their greatness then.
Though a little stone, yet 'twill go forth
Through the Nations that are large,
O it will indeed not be kept up,
Nor swim in a little barge.
O 'twill fail through great ships unto
The remore places farther,
And there 'twill do most great exploits,
To the praise of the Father.
The little stone, 'twill the image smite,
And 'twill break both toes and legs,
Yea thighs and arms it will slay it,
'Twill sure wound all their heads.
'Twill cast down every one who does
So insolently appear,
O therefore call now thy friends up,
That they may draw thee near.
O love invite thy dear friends
In o thy bosom sweet,
O Love do thou so ravish thine,
That they may thee here meet.
My soul is swallowed up in love,
O love does wax so great,
O love does crumble me surely,
That lays me at thy feet.

And every part stength does find.

And that is because from Father, Son, and Spirit
A witness does proceed.

Lay them up in your breast,
That you may know the difference,
Between false visions and the best.
