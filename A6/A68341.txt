Jason / towchyng the conqueste of the golden flese / mine auctor has not set

aboke of the hoole life of Jason. which he presented unto the noble Prince in

The prologue of thauctor
THe galeye of mine engyn floting not long syn in the depnes of the sees of
d^uce ancient histories in such wise as I would have brought mine esperite
unto the port or haven of rest. Suddenly apperid by me a ship conduited by one
man^ only. This man anon^ beheld my regard and contenan^ce. Which gave me
title and cause of thought and of abasshement^ for asm^ch as I saw his visage
triste-heuy and desolate* Whereof symton^ with compassion of his ennuye and
greef. as soon as he conceived that I so beheld him by greet desir. he held him
still and said to me in this wise / Man of rude engyn what meruail^st then /
Anc^e thy galeye h^re and take thy pen^e for to write and put in mem^^re my
faites and deeds / The king Jupiter of crete wa^ mine old^ bel^ fader and he
enge^drid (...) king of my^^^dene / Th^^ Cacus engen^dred my f^der Eson. I am
Jason that conquered the flees of gold in the isle of colchos. And that daily
labor in sorrow roted in tristresse for the dishon^our that som^e persons
hurt and empesshe my glorie^ Inposing to me not to have holden my promys
anoist med^a. Whereof thou have Xed the trouh. Then^e I pray the that thou do
make a book unto them that daily speak and inpugne my gloire may know their
indiscrete Iugem^nt. And for ^accomplisshe the same I have chosen the to the end
/ that thou present this present writing unto the fader of writ^^^ of
histories / which y^ unto Phelip fader and lover of all virtues in his time
^uc of Bourgoygne and of Brabant etc / The which has been in a^^ his time
inclined and of great affeccion to here and see red the ancient histories /
And to here told the faytes of the worthy and noble sometime flourisshing in
virtues in valyance and prudence for his singular passetemps^ These words
accomplisshid the ship and Jason vanisshed away and I abode there pensyf /
But in the end desiring to show the honor and declare the virtues of the said
Jason I ancred my galeye and put in writing his faytes as here after shall be
declared plainly and a long / so than I present my litil book unto right hye
and right redoubted ^u^ of Bourgoyne not presuming mine / I^eloqu^nce / but
presenting mine right humble and indigne service Thus ends mine Auctor his
prolege / And how well that hi^ is said before this prologe that Eson was sone to
Cacus^ Yet ^ochace says in the Genelagye of god^es that he was sone to
Erictheus the ^xxix^ sone of Jupiter / As ye may see more plainly in the ^xiij^
book of the Genelogy^ of gods the.xxiiij^ Chapter

ANciently the kings and Princes of hye felicite were attendaunt and awayted
when their seed should bring forth generation. But when so was that they might
not come thereto. What prosperity they had Their life was trauersid in contynuell
bewailing / and they vysited temples and oracles unto the comsu^macion of their
days. or unto thenhaunsement of their ^roysen^s. The noble king Eson of
Myrmydone whereof is made mention in the prologue. among all other things and
worldly prosperitees was right nobly regnyng. Certes he had hi^ Royaume
m^yntened in pees / He had in marriage a right fair lady^ but they were long to
geder with out having generation / whereof their days were full of bewaylynges
and of litill playsir in the goods of fortune. But they were contynuelly in
the temples and oracles. And no thing of their desire befelle unto them unto
the time that the king began to fall and wexe old by aage. Then^e h^s wife
conceived of his seed and multeplied the generation humayn of a right fair sone
At the burthe of this sone the noble queen deyde / And when the king Eson saw
his wife so depart from life to death. he bewepte her long time and made her
obsequye Right solempnly. And after he reioyed in his sone new born^. Whom he
named Jason Jason then^e grew in beaulte meruaillously. in so much that his
fader the king Eson took great playsir to nourisshe hym^ The time passid Jason
grew so long that he coud g^o and speak. And the noble king his fader becam
ancient in such manner that he might no more help him self / And on a day
c^llid* Jason his sone and said to him^ Fair sone Jason hit is force that I
pass out of this world by age which ledeth me to the death / For hit is the
dowaire that nature has endowed to me / and the passage which I must needs
make / how be hit I take hit well in patience / But when I behold thy great
yongthe / and know that thou art not yet pourueyed of discrecion for to
govern thy Royaume / hit is to me a great displeasir / For hit behooves that I
leave the tree that I have planted to fore I see what fruit he shall bring forth
/ My dear sone thou art the tree. And the fruit that thou shall bring forth
shall be thy werkes^ Certes my courage is right sore troublid fair sone Jason that
I shall depart fro this world and thou shall abide vnpourueyd of wi^te and
discrecion and right young of age / thou begynnest daily to grow and thou sh^lt
wax unto the Age of a Man^ And than thou shall render the fruit that I desire
to see^ But in the end when thou shall have taken thy full growing thou shall
decline a litil and a litil^ and after that shall be shadowed with death like as
the day wex^th derke by the night / And for as much as there shall leave nothing
in the world of the^ but only the Reno^mee of thy life / And that there is
nothing so lowable as the virtues I ^omande the that thou be virtuous and that
thou flee the vices and synnes^ My dear sone keep the^ that Couetise blind the
not^ But In any wise Apply the unto all things virtuous. Hit is over great
damage when a man lives rich of sins. and Right pour of virtues / ensiewe
always tho men that be wise and well reno^med / Learn whylis thou art young / and
believe no liars Theuis / Ioglers / ne deffamers of women / ne be not ydell ne
prodigous of thy tongue. take heed behold and see^ and say litil^ blame ne
hurt not thy neighbor / do to noman^ any wrong / be freendly to thy
neighbor. and be good lord and fader to thy subgettis in time and place / Thus
my fair sone put my doctrine to effect. and if thou do thus I doubt not but
thou shalst have habondan^ce of all good^s^ With this the teens came unto the
eyes of the an^cient and wise king and au^led a down by his visage by such
superfluite that he was constrained to cesse his spek^ng. and the damois^a^
Jason notwithstanding that he was yet a child. began then^e to foundre in
^eeris right habondantly. and there were plente of other that wept for pite /
and diconforted them self right p^etousl^^ Among all other the brother of king
Eson named Peleus there being present / could not hold n^ keep his mayntening
/ there was none but he wa^ troblid and sorry for the au^ciente and age of the
king and not with out cause. Nevertheless among these wepinges and
ahasshemen^^^ the king Eson becam again to him self and lift up his head / And
after callid peleus and said to him

MY right well belouid b^dder and the most nigh that I have of my blood after my
right dear sone / thou art also my secret and right especial frend^ And he
above all the men of the world in whom I have grettest affian^ce Take heed and
herkene my testament^ my ordenan^ce^ my com^andement and the conclusion of my
last will / First I am ready and content to deye when it shall plese the gods
to send me the death / Secondly I recom^ande unto the my dear sone Jason.
Thirdly I Recom^ande to the and d^liuere the conduyte of my people into thy
guard and proteccio And constytute the Regent and governor of my Royaume /
unto the time that my sone Jason shall be of aage And fynably I pray the that
then^e thou will corone him with my Corone that belongs and apperteyneth^ to
him by right. With this the noble king finisshed his testament And his brother
Peleus took the charge of the gounau^ce of the royaume. And fro then^e forthon
took the rewle of the cite / and Jason that by space of time came to the age
of.xviij. year was a goodly young man fair of vysage meruaillously / and well
made in all his members / The noble king Eson endoctrined him alway^ and
admonested him eu to do virtuous works ^ sayng that the heart adourned with
virtue rendrith the man noble / and nothing the noble stok or progenye Tydingis
can then^e into mirnridone that the king of Thebes should make a great solemn
feste in his cite for the love of a new knight that he would make^ and when
Jason knew that / he required the king his fader that he would give him license
for to go unto this feste for to begin and ensiewe Arms. The king was right
well content / and ordained that peleus should go with him What shall I make you
long compte peleus and his neuewe put hem to point in arms and of horses.
and syn went to Thebes at the day assigned that the feste should be ordained
and kept. And found there many Princes / kings Baron^s and knights. of whom
they were well received and greatly fested. and hercules him self for whom the
feste was made welcomed hem hyely and with great Reverence

Thapparail then was at this day in thebes great and so^ptuous / for the king
held open court / and the kings princes baron^s and knights ladies and
damoiselles ete in the halle / and after the dinner the tables taken up / the
ladies and Damoyselles mounted upon the scaffoldes / And on that other side the
knights arrayed them in arms and mounted on their horses. and drew hem unto a
place propice for the ioustes / and when the king of thebes had given to his
sone hercules the order of knighthode. then^e one and other couched good
speres corageously and began to just in such wise that many were born^ down
to the erth^ / and specially al they that encou^trid hercules

THe noise began right great in this place. and there was great nombre of
speeres broken and good sheldes persed / Hercules did there great and hye
prowesses / And in like wise mayntened him Jason / for they met with no
knights in recou^tring what they where but that they bar^ hem out of their
arson^s. And at this time the worthy h^^^cules began to love Jason of so
parfayt love that for then^e forth^on he named him his brother. and held him
for the most adressid knight in arms that he had seen in his time. In this
Journey hercules and Jason asayed each other many times in the ioustes and
otherwise / and neu bare that one that other to the erth^. whereof all they that
saw it had great meruaille^ for as much as Hercules was more in members and
hygh^er then Jason was / but Jason was so well on horse back / that noman^ might
unhorse him^ The ladies and damoiselles beheld gladly Jason for his hye
vayllian^ces. and preysed and honored him above all other And so did all
other beholding his noble faytes Reseruid peleus which seeing that Jason was
somoche recommended of every man / deliberid and concluded. that by his power
he should get anon a great bruyt. And that by his valiance he should acquire
thonour of all thassemblee. and conceyuyd a meruayllous envy upon the glory
that Jason gate / And wisshid that Hercules had persid his heart with his spear
What shall I make you long compte / Jason ouerthrewe to the ground the king
fokenes The king of mylicene. The king of mydicque and the king of Epydance /
And ^xxx. other good knights / he had no re^te in him self / he never
refuses struck of spere^ he sought none but the strengest and the most aspre
and most expert in Arms / And in troth as to their semyng that beheld him
he seemed above all^ other to be right well^ vsid in the faites of Armes^ and
that in all his lyff he had den other style / but to Ious^e^ tournoye and to
smite with his sw^rd great strokes and poysan^t^ so fires was his contenau^ce

SO long dured these Ioustes that these two worthy Gentilmen^^ Hercules and
Jason outhrew their felaw^ and gate the field In such wise that there ne abode
knight ne esquyer in the sadyl / but they fond hem in their way. then^ when
the Ioustes ^ailled / Ladies and Damoisells departed fro the scaffoldes and
returned unto the palace. The Iousters unarmed them / And put hem in fair
array. and after went them unto the ladies in to the palace / There then^e
began the daunses / the carolles. and the feste right noble and Joyous unto the
time that the tables were couerid / and that every man was set as it
apperteyned to his degree and estate. As of the metes and viande that they were
seruid of / it needs not to make m^^co^n^ euy man wa^ seruid solempnly and
there was speking of the hye valian^ce^ of Hercules and of Jason. And in
especial of the damoys^au Jason / for so much as he was estranger. The ladies
held their devises a part. and said that they had never seen so fair and so
goodly a young man / Pyrithron of Thessayle was there among all other^ the
which when he apperceyuid that euerich had well eten and dronken raysonably.
he stood up and required al them that were there that on that day a month
following they would come and ^e at his wedding What shall I saye^ Som^e said
that they would come and som^e said nay. And so the s^^pper pass^^^. And Jason
was fested there right long and in especial of the kyg^e Princes and
princesses / And aft^^ ^ong^e and l^cen^e taken and ^ctroi^d he returned in^o
his cou^tre^. And then^e when he cons^derid that time was for to goo to the
w^dding of Pyrithion / by the gr^ and consenting of his fader / he arrayed him
self and put him in point Right nobly / and then^e he went theder / and his
uncle Peleus with him. And they made such dyligence that they came in short
time unto the noble Cite of thessalonycque

When the king ^xion^ knew the coming of Jason and peleus he went again them
and made meruaillous there unto Peleus / but yet he made right much more unto
Jason for the good loos and hye Renom^e that he had gotten in Thebes^ And made
him to descend in his palace / and after brought him unto Hercules that was
there with in a chamber. And required him that he would make and a doube him
knight / sayng that hit was time. and that his playsir was. that at the weddyng
of his sone he should sytte among the knights / and that hit well appart^yned to
him The right worthy hercules herd gladly the king speak and made there Jason
knight with great honor / And Jason full of right good will opend his mouth^
and said in this manner Right noble worthy Chosen / and right wise knight
among all other shyning in all virtues hit has plesid unto you / for to
call me unworthy and indigne to be of the hye and commended order of knighthode
Whereof I thank you with all mine heart / and this noble king also from whom
in party thonour is comen to me / But among all this well and worship I pray
you that hit may plese you tassigne me a place where I may do the saytes
Cheuaulerous and knightly / unto this end that ye have not enployed your time
evil so much to honor and worship me / And that I may in the days of my
young the ensiewe the hye and preysed virtues of you that are the very and sewre
fou^dem^nt / upon which my total espoyr and hope rests for to come unto the
works of Recome^dacion Certes fair brother Jason / ansuerd Hercules / hit is
now that I have promoted you unto the dygnite of knigh^thode / I have no
commandment over you / And if it be your desir to hau^te Arms and to ocupie
you therein / Enquire of the wars of the world / and if hit happen that ye
put you in arms / be ware that ye in the Ioustes do to no man oppression /
and be ye to all people humble and curtoys / Nature hath^ begone in you a man
garnisshid with vertues^ the gods continue hit

With these words Peleus came up on Hercules and Jason And Jason auowed that he
should goo unto the first war that he should here speak of / And than one and
other began to devise and speak of the prowesses of Hercules What shall I make
you long taryeng / this day passed And the morn came / And this day Pyrithyon
espoused the fair Ypodame with much great honor / and made them so great
chere that Eurichus the heed and Captayn of the centaures was dronken / And in
like wise were their felaws These Centaures were an ^C^ men that always held
^em in Arms for to keep the Contreye of thessaylle / And they held hem in one
place which was named Molose / they were all great and fourmed as giants When
than they were so dronken as said is / And that the wyn had (...) mounted hem
in words and tencions as is a Custom in such a a^as / and brawlid among hem
self / In so much that Pyritheon with sum other began to Reuerse th^re metes
and tables fighting with hem with pettes and pl^ters right long and by such
furour / that hercules ne Jason ne the Ladies might ne could not set any
Reme^ie And this battle dured so long / that Euricus and many other of the
Centaures departed thens / disposed for to do and co^mise a great outrage as
they dyde^ whereof they came to late to repent hem^ for they went and Armed
them hastily / And after thus armed Returned unto the wedding^ And in this
dronkenship they Rauisshed the fair Ypodaine out from all the other Ladies
and Damois^lles And Euricus bare her away upon his sholdres

THan Hercules and Jason began to Run to take their Arms and were sone ready
for to departe^ And followed after the dronkardes that went relyng on all sides
in the feldes / And so sore siewed them that they ouerto^e them in a grene
field. And were no more on their side but they two only / how be hit that many
siewed them as well^ knights as ladies and gentilwomen^ / but that was not
ferre^ When the worthy Hercules and the noble preu Jason had retained these
centaures. they had each of them a bow which they bend. And syn they escried
all the dronken centaures unto the death / And shot on them in such faco^n /
that Hercules araught one of them named Grineus bitwene the eyes / and with his
arowe nailed him fast unto a tree which stood by hynde him^ And the nobl^
Jason smote another centaure in the nekke with a trenchan^t arowe. and smote
him doun^ in the presence of one named Guericus / which escried right
furiously upon Hercules and Jason. And with this cry all the centaures rengid
hem against the two knights and marchid against them so troublid that they
sone after reculed as much o^ more as they had goon^ forward as people
replenisshid out of mesure of drink and mete / for Jason and hercules
pers^cuted them with their arowes as long as they dured and slew a gre^^
nombre. And when her shot faylled they drew out good swerdes and came and
fought hand to hand the miserable glotons by such vigor that their swerdes
were anon^ dyed with their blood

When the centaures saw the swerdes of hercules and Jason so dyed in their
blood / and also when they perceyuid their felaws deye so with sorrow tofore
them / feling also the languisshing and smarting of their wou^des / som^e there
were that put hem to the flight. and the other deffended them with all their
puissau^ce / Than the noble Jason shewid his vailliance meruayllously for he
araught noman with a right struck but he bare him down to the earth / or made
his soul depart fro the body / And they that abode and saw his swerd
trenchau^t wexe read of the blood of their felawes were not right well
assewred / Certes he defended him as one that doubted nothing / and so did
hercules semblably What shall I make you long process / Jason slew with his
own hand.iiij. geants of the said Cent^^ures named / Petreus / Doillas /
Cillarus / and Perthones and other moo which were not so great / And the worthy
Hercules slew and hew down moo than thretty and somoche trauaylled by the
aid of Jason and other / that he wan the place upon them and came to his above
/ This Euri^us and his accomplices lost the place and supposed to have fled.
but Jason smote than among them by such ardau^t courage / in discharging his
sword upon the sholdre on the right side of Euricus / that hit cutted a two
his heart / which fylle down deed at his feet. wherefore the other seeing that
/ were anon so discoraged / that they sparklid abroad / that the most part of
them suffrid and let hem be slain and hewn in pieces without making or
showing any deffence / And the other fled so^me here and so^me there Thus was
the fair Ypodayne delivered of these vylayn glotou^s and oultrageous by the hye
vaillyance of the two worthy knyghtis Jason and Hercules / Whom after this
noble victory they rendrid and delivered unto her parents and friends

Great was the loos and preyssing meruaillously that Jason gate there with the
noble hercules for his hye virtue / certes Hercules brought her again to the
palace with great glory / And all the world recom^ended Jason reseruid peleus
which deyde for sorou / for the great worship that was made to him in his
presence / Then^e began the ladies to Reioye them silf and to chan^ge their
sorou into gladness / The fare ypodayne was a^urned and arayd all new / she
slepte that night with her lord. The night passid. and peleus on the morn^
callid Jason / and said that their long s^^^urnyng displaisid him / and that he
would return unto his count^eye. When Jason had vnd^rstande peleus / he
answered to him and said that he was ready to depart at his good plaisir.
Th^n^e peleus made for to sadle his horse. And in the mean while he ladd Jason
for to take congie ^ leave of the king yxion^^ of Pirithyon. of Ypodayne / of
Hercules and of many other. And after they retorn^d into their logyse But when
they supposed to have taken and ^^^nted on their horses. two esquyers came to
Jason which presented to him two right fair and exellent destriers or horses /
that one from the king yxion^. and that other from Ypodayne Certes Jason
receyuid this present in great gladness / thanking many time the noble king and
Quene^ And then^e he mounted on that one of the same horse. and offrid that
other to his uncle Peleus. but he would never accept hit And said that he was
not digne ne worthy to receive so noble a present / and when he had thus said
he smote his horse with spores and departed and Jason followed after Certes
peleus lied not sayng that he was not worthy to receive so noble a p^sent / as
that was which Jason presented him For he was a traitre to Jason / which
intended to nothing but for to do to him playsir / O cursid blood / certes this
peleus might not rest ne sleep he was so pensif / how he might bring about to
make Jason his propre neuew to deye and to this ^mouid him envy and disloyal
detracco^n whereof he was full

HA / a / Right Miserable and right disnaturall envy how may these noble men
and also other nourisshe the in their hertes / They that enclyne and give them
unto these traytrous meninges / may in no manner have rest day ne night Thou
lyftest hem up into hye thoughts of glerie / thou make hem to mou^te unto
the highest t^ppe by oultrequydau^ce and furquydrye above kings and emperors
promysing to them largely^ but when hit comes for tacquyte the promesses /
thou castest hem low down: brekest their necks Ha a / puerse murdeyer ^ how
many men and also women have been slain and ded by thy poisons / it is now no
need for to bring forth example of thi^ time present for to approve thy couerd
falsenes and how thou abusest and deceyuest them that have affiance in ^he but
for to continue our matter with this hit suffiseth^ for to see the end of our
history of this said peleus which gaf him to somoch^ travail for to ymagine
and proiecte the deth^ of his nevewe Jason which so much affied and trusted
in him how Jason went for to serve the queen mirro and how the king of
Sklauonye was vaynquishid and chaced fro his siege

PEleus and Jason Departed than fro Thessalonyque in a morening that one right
triste and sorrowful. And that other right Ioyeus / And when they were on the
field Jason as fresshe and lusty began to prove and essaye his horse / and
Peleus as sorrowful and trayttre as he was began to abasse and hang down his
heed / and syn said to him self in his evil courage / shall I never come to my
desir / what is this / how shall I do / certes I wot never. shall I murdre
Iason^ nay. and wherefore / for treuly for asmoch as I should be enfamed / for
murdre can not be hyd / notwithstonding he must be ded certainly / this is the
conclusion. or ellis I shall be put doun^ and leave the honors royal^ and shall
come to mendicite and poute^ O what mortal pain shall I make him to deye. it
is force / but who shall give him the morsel of deth^ Hit must be thought on^^
if I require another to do this. parauenture he shall have pite of Jason for
asmoch as he is in the grace of all the world and shall accuse me. if I do
ordeyne any poyson^ and Jason be put thereby to death / they that have made and
mixte hit / shall not co^ne keep it secrete^ And also that more is Jason shall
well keep him self from such poyson^. O what thoughts have I. I see none
other moyen but that I must conmyse this caas with my propre hand. Peleus
conspiring in this faco^n not knowing how he might exploite for to attain to
execute his dampnable envy r^d^ forth all this day unto the even / which
took loggis. in the house of an ancient lady whom she receyuyd with great Joy
and Jason also. and they fond her covering the table for to feste a strange
knight which she had loggid for charity

INcontinent then^e as Peleus and Jason were alighted from their horse / the
ancient lady mad^ hem to wasshe and sytte at table. and the strange knight
with them and seruid hem with such mete as she had. and as they had taken
their refecco^n / Jason axid the strange knight after diuce words. what he was
and what he sought / In troth noble gentilman ^nsuerde the knight / I am of
the rich royaume of Olifern^ And litil servant unto the queen of the contre
that I have named / and I certefye you that in remenau^t of all the world is
no fayrer lady / and also there is none more desolate and sorrowful / for the
mighty king of sklauonye would have her to his wife for her great beauty / unto
whom she will in no wise accord her self / and for asmoche as she has plainly
refused him / he is entrid into her royame in arms destroyng all to fore him
with fire and sword he is comen and has besiegid her in her cite of Oliferne
/ to fore which cite and during the siege he has had many fair victories
against the ayda^ts and helpars of the queen / the which in liuering diuerce
batailles unto the Esclauons which they have lost ben sore dimunisshid of
their forces and strength / for they have slain of the knights of the said
lady a great nombre that tho few that yet live dare not now issue out more for
to make any saulte or scarmusche against their enemies Wherefore the vaillyant
princess willing for to deffende her self unto the death / has sent into diuce
places her messagers / and me among the other for tassemble for her souldyours
and men learned in the war for to do her aid against her enemies as well for
her money as for to help to keep thonour of ladies wherefore I pray you if ye
know any in this contre that hit may plese you to adresse me to them and ye
shall do great charity and to me great curtosie

IN telling the knight this that said is he could not keep him self from weping
/ but wept tenderly / And when Jason had understood and thought a litil of the
necessite of the lady / considering also her great beauty / he wept also for
pity / and adressid his words unto peleus and said Dear uncle ye have well
herd this good knight speak / what seems you. To whom peleus ansuerde /
Certes fair neuew Me thinks in mine aduys that the king of Esclauonye does
evil and great syn^e for to war and destroy the country of one so fair a
lady / and if I had no more charge then^e ye have. without making long soiourn^
or tarieng I should go unto the socours of one so noble a lady. and I ensure and
promise upon my troth ansuerde Jason then^e. that to morn as erly as I may
shall mon^te on horsback and in the company of this good knight I shall go unto
this lady / and shall do to her all the service and plaisir that I shall can do
and may / for to begyn^e and ensiewe the order of knighthode / where fore I
pray you that ye recom^ande me unto the good grace of my lord my fader. and
that ye of your good grace wole often times pray unto the gods for me

When p^le^ had understand the vow of Jason / he was right joyous / for he
was in thopynion that he should neu return f^o this vyage / and that by this
moyen he should be quyte of him with his worship and honor / Then^e peleus
promised to Jason that he should accomplisshe with good heart all that he had
required of him^ and syn^ recom^ended him to the knight of oliferne / and
then^e it was time to withdraw them wherefore they went to rest unto on the
morn and then^e aroos and took leave each of other. and thus went Jason with
the strange knight unto the noble cite of oliferne / and peleus returned unto
mirmydone prayng the gods that Jason might be smyten with thonder or through
persyd with.v.C. speris or to be buried in the sea to the end that there were neu
moo tidinges of him. Such or semblable were the prayers that the peruers
peleus made for the total destrucco^n of his gentil neuewe Jason. the most
adressed knight that eu was in mirmidone^ This notwithstanding the noble Jason
exployted always his journey / and went so f^rre he and the knight that he
brought him and rendrid him in oliferne. and p^sented him unto the queen for to
serve her in her war / This queen was callid Mirro / which is asmoch to say
as mirror in beauty

When Jason saw him to fore the queen / he beheld her with great entente
enclinyng him self and making to her reuerence^ And she seeing that he was
much fair and a young gentilman^ well made in all his members / and having a
chiere of a v^iller^us man^ / receyuid him into her wages as a s^uldyer / as
she that had great need to have such knights in great nombre / but this was
not only upon his person but also upon his hye maintene and behauyng iuging in
him gre^^ courage which was not lyk to any noble man^ that eu she (...) seen /
After the p^sentaco^n of Jason and that the fair m^rro had retained him in her
wagrs and souldies of her ordenan^ce / The knight that conduyted him brought
him fro the palace into the toun^ and deliuerid for him a good logys. The fair
Myrro had at that time triews with her enemies for.xv. days Certes these
triews anoied much to Jason for he deman^ded nothing but for to employe him in
all faites of arms to that end^ that he might do plaisir unto so fair a lady /
the fair mirro / which neu was out of his mind / for ye shall understand that
syn the time that Iason^ had beholden and seen the great beauty of the lady /
she was wreton^ by love in his heart so acertainly that he could neu keep him
fro thinking on her in alowing and preysing / her yonghte / her contenan^ce.
her wit and all her other virtues / where with she was endowed and adourned
and she had no more but / xvi / yer of age also he brought to his mind her
fair and fresshe color / her ladyly maytiene and her noble faco^n and
corpul^ce / wherefore he was so esmeuid and esprised with love that he wiste not
what to th^nke what thing was him befalle / and in this estate he was many a day

AMong these things during these triew^ / the king of sklauonye sent his
propre messager unto the far mirro for to require her that she should give
audience to one of his knights that he would send unto her / to whom he had
give charge for to say to her cert^yn secret things which audience she
agreed / and than the said messager deperted and reported to the king that the
far myrro was co^ten^e for to here his knight. Of thise tidingis the king of
sclauonye had much great joy and as he that somoch b^^^de in the love of the
queen myrro and wist not what thing should befall him / wherefore he disguised
him self the best wise that to him was possible / and by the i^se of certain
herbs he f^oted h^e visage and changed his color / and syn took.ij. of his
knights with him whom he trusted / to whom he declared how he would goo unto
his lady pamours fayning that he was a simple knight of the kings court and
deffended hem expressly that they shold^ not make to him honor ne reverence /
sauf only thonour of a felaw to a felaw / and anon as he had adutised of that
they should do / he put him on the way so secretly that he ^ntrid in to
oliferne and so exployted that he was brought to for the noble queen Mirro /
whom he had never seen to fore / where he knelid down on his knees right
humbly to fore her / and how well as he was all rauisshed in thinking and
beholding her meruaillous beaute^ for he had neu seen tofore so far a creature
/ after the reuerences there made he said to her in this manner

NOble and right renomed princess the king of Esclauonye my souerayn and
puissau^t lord recom^andeth him right humbly to your good grace and noble
memory. and for so much as he has understand that ye be content to here
his demand. and that he offrith for the love / for the well / the honor and
prouff^^t of you / and of your royame / if hit plese you ye shall give me
audience and good expedico^n / With these words the lady com^anded the king
that he should stand up as she that wist not what he was^ and syn drew her a
litil a part^ wherf^re the king approuched ner her and said / Right virtuous
princess / ye know how by diuce times your right humble servant the king of
esclauonye hath^ required you by his barons and enbassadours / that it should
plese you to be his wife and felaw. And always in feet ye have refus^d him And
for cause of which refuse as I am advised he has ^^trid into your royame and
assailid it by war as ye may perceive / yet always to put him self in deuoir
/ he has sent me to you for to require your desired grace / as he that has
more gretter pite of you and your country then^e ye have your self as me
semeth^ wherefore he requires you by me that at this time ye have pite of your
true lover / of whom the fortune is such that certes he d^yeth in
languisshing after you. ha a my right redoubted lady after the Judgment of the
men^ ye ar the very myrrour of al virtues / of al bou^te and noblesse Here
then^e the voys of your servant speking by my mouth^ and requiring your grace
and pite the most humble wise that to him is possible / the pour and desolate
king your right true well willare may not be in no place without thenking on
you his ymaginacion conpryseth nothing but your name and beauty / his stomach
digesteth^ nothing but your triu^phant glory / his prayers ne suffrages mo^te
not unto the gods but in calling them to the augme^tacion of your well / Alas
have ye pity and mercy on him^ on your people and on your Royaume / and on me
that am his secret messager of love / Condesce^de ye in will for to be his
lad^ and ma^stresse to the end that he may atteyne to the chief of his d^sir^
and also to th^nde that your cite and your men may dwell in pe^^ and rest

IN pronou^sing these or semblable words the dol^^ous king made many sighs
and began to chauffe and to sweet in such agonye as he had been a prisoner
presented to fore a Judge for to receive Sentence of gra^^ or of death The wise
and discrete Myrro suffrid him ^ach^e^e all his proposicion / And when he had
purpos^d all that leave enseygned him f^r this time. She was not so
dispourueyed of ^^uis ne of entendem^nt / but pro^ptly and me^rly she made to
him this answer Messagyer when I have well understand you I am all abashed
how my mort^l enmye can or may require me of love of any aliau^ce w^an by his
cultrage and cruelte he i^ by great wrong ^^tr^d in to my Royaume with Armed
hand pylled and co^^ed my land / slain my people / b^e^te my contre. and yet
(...) has besieged me in my cite of Oliferne. and when I have well ouerthought
these said things I answer (...) this time for all / that I shall rather
suffer my self and al my royame to be destroyed than in any manner shall
co^des^^^de to his requests and to his will / Certes madame ans^erde the king
me thinks ye be not well conceyled^ ne considere ye not that your desdayne
have been cause of the death of fifty thousand men^ / And how^ have ye no regard
that he is so noble and so puissau^t a king. and that he loves you with so
parfayt love that all his desir is not but for to mow come to your good grace
/ In troth it apperith by that / that is said to you^ that he has more
gretter pite of your noble person. of your men and of your desolate Royaume /
then^e ye have your self And therefore madame thenke ye on these things and
beware that by your cruelte and defaute your good lover and friend if hit
plese you / fall not in despair / I wot never what may incline you (...) to.
but if it be that ye will and desire rather the general and total destrucco^n of
your ro^a^^^ then^e other wise. And by all my gods hit is gre^e ou^^age and
folly that meuith you thereto

CErtes messager ansuerde the wise maid unto the Esclauon king / the ^uyte or
wrestling of your words is not strong ynouh^ for to beat doun^ and oucome the
constan^ce of my continence / I love my men and people naturelly And to this
end that all the world know that I say trouth^ also long as the soul
abides in my body / I shall neu have love ne alian^ce unto mine enmye / and
speak no more to me thereof / With this the king was all vainquisshid and
desconforted of socours / and was so terribly displaisid and angry of aspre and
mortal anger that in a great despair and wanhope he said to her / O fell lady
and most rebel and lest pietous that eu deperted out of woman's belly syn that
I must acquit me when I perceyu^ that your sweet courage wole not acorde unto
me^ ne entende unto the continuel supplicacions of you so true lover / I me
deporte from hens forth for to speak any more of this matter / but I you ensure
as soon as the triew^ shall faylle. ye shall be guerdoned after yower fyerste
With th^se words the king of S^lauonye departed thens with a chiere penfyf /
And retour^ed to his Ooste more desiring to come to his entencion ^han ^uer he
had been to fore / And the fair Myrro litil s^^ing by his menaces / b^gan to
devise with so^me of her Gentilwomen in recou^ting to them the prayers and
request ^s that her mortal enmye had made to her What shall I ^^ye you more /
the t^iews faylled at time set and exsp^^ed And when they were thus faylled
the king of S^lauonye more the^king on the fair Myrro / than was need to him /
made his men to put hem in Arms many a day. hoping that they of Oliferne
should come out and make him skarmuches / but he lost his pain / for there was
not in the cite any man that durst issue out for to assaylle them / for
asmoche as they had always against hem the worse / and than when he knew that
they of Oliferne were so crem^use and rebowted and durst not come out / he
chose on a day fyfty of his knights / and said to them / that for the love
of his lady he would Iust^ again them all / one after an other / and syn
b^ought hem unto a place propice for to Just in / which was right fair in the
sight for them of the cite / and there began they to ^^ste making so
merueyllous ab^uyt that they of Oliferne herd hit and and ran unto the
bateillement and lowpes of the walls

Jason went for to set these Ioustes with the other and anon as he saw the
manner of the sklauonoye h^ had great sorou in him self / and by a meruaillous
courage he went to the palace to fore the fair Myrro / And after the reverence
made^ he said to her / My right redoubted lady I can not have marvel ynouh^
of the great slouthe and lachenes of your men / for I have see your mortal
enemies devise and just right nygh to your cite with a litil company / in
such wise as oliferne were dispourueyed in all^ points of men^ and of
deffence. Ha a madame what is this^ Certes all they that been therein receive
great blame. and therefore I pray you for your honor and also myn^ that ye will
deliue me.x. of your soldiers / and that it plese you that I may conduyte
them upon your enemies and if ye wole so do I suppose that we shall make affraye
to them as great as they had any long syn^ The fair myrro hering the request
of Jason allowed much his good will and enquired of him the nombre of her
enemies / and when ^he was ad^tised that there were no moo but fifty / she sent
for.xij^ knights which were newly comen fro the cite of damask to whom she
declared the request of Jason / and a^id of them if they would adventure hem
with him. They beheld Jason and seeing his mayntene and that he was the best
ad^esshid knight that eu they had seen. and that his request departed fro a
right noble courage / They ansuerde that they would acompanye him unto the death.
Then^e the noble maid he^ring what they said acorded to Jason to enteeprise
that he had required of her / When Jason perceyuid that his request was acorded
to him. he thanked the fair lady with good herte^ and after recom^anded him
unto her noble prayers After that he required the.xij. knights that they should
speed them to put hem in point promising them good adventure This don they
went and armed them And mou^teth^ upon their horses / And when their helmes
and sheldes were laced / They did do opene one of the gates of the Cite
which they held continuelly closed for all doubts and aualed the draw
brigge / and they Rood out in to the field / and Ioyously Rood against the
esclauons / which as said is were Iousting again their king by solace

When the noble Maid Myrro and the Ladies knew that Jason was on his way
they monted upon an hye tour / out of the which they might plainly see in the
ooste of their enmyes / and they tarried not long when the king of Sclauonye
had perceyuid Jason and his felawes which came to him ward / wherefore he left
the Iousting and callid his knights / to whom he said / Fair lords ye have
made upon my body an esproue of Chyualerie for the love of my Lady / But now
thenke ye for to get honor and laud for the love of me / and proeue you
mightly upon this litil mombre of knights Olifernoys that come upon us / we
ben four against one / wherefore we shall put hem to death al so lightly as the
lion deuoureth^ the lamb with his teth and claws With these words the noble
Jason and his felawes assewrid on their horses syn took their sheldes which
were fast bonden to their breasts brandisshed their speris and es^ryed their
enemies / which broched their horses with their spores and receyuid them and
recou^trid with the might of their speris and so asprely assailed them that it
seemed that they should have confounded them to fore hem^ bu^ when hit came to
the tronchoning of their speris / Jason that best was horsid of all the other
receyuid the first strook^ And with his spear he was atteyned of the king of
sclauonye by such a might that he percid the shield on the right side. And
there he brake his spear / and Jason smote him on the so^mette of his shield by
such a might / that he made him to reuerse his heed and made hit to hurtle
again the Cruper of his horse by hind so astonyed that his feet were lift
upward that the rayn of his horse brack and fill down from his horse unto the
ground / the which horse than Ran astraye in to the field / than passid forth
Jason right Joyous of his good adventure / And with an other spear that he had
taken of his esquyer for to fulcome his emprise / came and recou^trid one of the
best knights of slilauonye / to whom he gaf so desmesurable a stroke in the
mids of his shield / that he percyd hit and the hauberk and haqueton in to
the body in such wise that he fill down deed fro the horse to the earth / And
than they smote to gyder on both parties by the strength of their speres well
sharped with stele / And for the great nombre of thesclauons that were there
in Regard of them that recou^trid them / So^me left the stour and went for
to conforte their king which lay on the earth all astoned and as ded^ And the
other intended for to furnisshe their enemies / Thus began the bataylle fires
aspre and Rygorouse as well with speris that sone were troncho^ned as with
good trenchau^t swerdes / and they of Damask mayntened them so hyely by the
example of noble Jason that with Iousting they bare down.vj^ of their enemyes^
Of whom four were deed on the field and the other two were so hurt in the
falling that they might never help hem self after

YE may well understand that this stour began aspre and meruaillous / The
Esclauons set their king on horseback again as well as they could upon one of
the horses of them that were deed / and then^e all they se^te hand on their
swerdes and came for to entremedle with Jason and them of his company /
smyting on them so dismesurably that Jason knew anon^ that he should be slain
/ if he defended him not with all his power. And then^e concluded in his courage
that er he left his life he would make his Reno^mee grow in oliferne and in
Esclauonye. or he would deye in the pain / with that he hau^ced his clear
^^^nchau^t sword of steel / And dischargid hit upon the ^^^me of a Esclauon^
by such virtue that he clefte his (...) unto the brayn^. that he fill doun^
deed f^o his horse to (...) earth and in passing further he smote an other in
the (...) of his king. by such force that he cut of a quartre of (...)
s^^lde and his left arm with all. And when the ^^ng apperceyuyd that Jason
departed such strokes he h^d doubt of his person / And that was no great
meruaille. then^e as worthy and vailliau^t as he was he es^ried Jason to the
death. and syn came to him with his trenchu^t sword othou^sed^ And smote him so
mightily upon the top of his helm / that he made the sparklis flee ou^e /
and his heed to enclyne low doun^^ whereof he was not liti^^ astoned. but
escried him sayng. Vaissale ye have well shewid to me how ye can recou^tre a
man with the spear / but I shall show to you the sharpnes of my sword and how
that I am better knight then^e ye. And if ye escape fro my hands without
receyuyng of deth^. I well well that ye say to my Lady paramours the fair
Myrro. that her love and friend of Sklauonye has neither force ne might

How the king of Sklauonye was vaynquysshid by Jason in the field by bataylle
Much was Jason desplaysau^t when he had understand the vau^tises of his
mortal ennemy. But when he knew that he was the king of sklauonye he was well
Joyous for to know him and thus said to him by derysion. Ha / a right
oultrageous fool / Art thou he that art aff^yled with the blanch feures for
cause of my right redoubted lady^ Now see I well that in the is more of
presumpcion than of vayllyau^ce / and of vau^tise than of fayte and t^uly more
of folly than of wysedom. For hit is p^rfayte folly to the for to name the
better knight than I am. Than la^e us see who is the better With these worthey
began again to smite each other Right asprely^ Certes Jason prouyd him self
Right fiersly in gyuyng to his enem^e many strokes ter^yble and poysau^t. And
so many gaf him in making Reed his swerd of the blood of the Esklauon king
that the right malerouse king was constrained to cry and to call his knights
unto his aid and help. but there came so many that Jason was ^nuiro^ned and
assailed on all sides

When the Noble Jason felt him self so aduironned on all sides by his enemies
/ He was more reconforted than to fore. And began to smite wyth^ his good swerd
of steel on the Right side and on the lift side by such virtue and might /
that the ladies of the Cite knew him among all other / and perceived that he
skarmusshid with his sword all dyed with new blood now here / and now
there^ And after saw him cut of heedes / arms and legs and fystes / And
made arms at his will and more then all the remena^nt^ And certes by his
mayntene he seemed better a thing of that other world then^e an humayne person
/ And fro this time forth^ on the fair Myrro seeing this that said is / took
Jason so in her good grace that unto the death she (...) above all other
knights. as she that setted her l^ue totally in him The noble Jason fought
th^n^e vaill^au^tly again the Esclauons / and right long endured the bat^ylle.
And when the.xij. knights of damask saw the great ^^ow^ss^ and the dangerous
stour that was about their master / Th^^ smote in among them that so assailed
him / And then^e enforced him Jason for to make him self to be of val^ur^ truly
by such ardeur of courage that he slew their ten of the most hardyest knights
of all ^he ^^oste of his ^^^myes. wherefore the king of esclauonye seeing his
ma^ntene: the valeur of Jason had such fur^ur and d^^de. that ^e h^^^ndon^ed
the place and his knights / that then^e all weary followed him / And then^e the
noble Jason followed the chaas and chaced hem unto the great ^ost in such
afusion and mo^tal occ^sion^ / that of the fyfty knights that were at the
beginning of the battle there escaped no moo but ten. but they were all slain
and detrenched or hewn in pieces^ And of the party of Jason there bleef no moo
but tweyn^ upon the field. And of the remanan^t all were hurt that one more
anguisshously then^e that other

How Jason was Ioyously receyuid of the queen Myrro of Olyferne and how they
bewaylled each other
AFter this meruayllous bataylle. and that the worthy Jason had rechaced his
enmyes unto nyghe by the ooste as said is he tarried for.ij. resons / The first
was for as much as he saw his felaws weary and sore payned by their wou^des /
and the second was for asmoche as he saw the O^ste meue for to come upon them
/ and than as wise and discrete he withd^ewe him sayng that more is worth a
good retrayte / than a folisshe abydinge / and reentrid with great honor and
gle^e into the cite / whereof the fair myrro was as Io^ouse as she could be /
and contrary to this was the king of sclauonye as soro^ful and angry for the
great damage that he had suffrid that day / Every man in oliferne as soon as
Jason was reentrid s^ewed him and man women and children blessid him sayng one
to an other that they had neu seen none lyk to him in beauty ne more vaillyau^t
knight of his body / and than all the cite began to reioye / and when the fair
mirro thought that Jason was unarmed / she sent for him / and he came gladly to
her / for that was al his desir / than when he was comen to fore her he salewed
her / and she rendrid to him his salewe / and syn demanded him how he felt him
self and how he ferde / Certes madame ^nfuerde Jason to god begyue the thanking
I ne feel on my body but al good disposicion / and am ioyously returned into
your cite and as to the regard of your enmyes / by that I have felt of them /
me thinketh^ that they ought not sore to be dredde ne doubted and that in short
time / ye shall have of them good rayson I have this day made my swerd reed in
their blood. Whereof their king your mortel enemy hath^ had great dueyl and
sorrow. And I have yet good will that to morn^ I shall redouble that^ and yet
that shall be worse to him and to his / if the gods be in mine aid and help

WHilis that Jason spack thus to the noble Lady as said is / she beh^lde him
now and now by right great ardau^t love / and could not absteyne her self / for
she was so surmou^ted with love at this time that for to ^yde her will and to
refroide and cole her a litil without mo^^ speking to Jason / that she left him
with two damois^ll^s for to entretene and tarry him. and she withdrewe her into
her chamb^^ wh^re she began to think on the great virtues that were in Jason
That is to wete on his hye prowesse^on (...) on his laughyng eyes on his ^ell
mad^ body / and on hy^ graciouse speking. And so much she thought on (...)
that she must come again unto the place where (...) she fond in the halle of
the palace plente of her (...) and of the most noble of the cite^ and there was
ne^ly arrived a messager of the king of damask. that certef^ed to her^ that
tath euenyng should come unto her aid two thousand ass^ri^ns. which the king
his lord had sent to her in the con^duyte of his brother named Prus^us. which
was a Right valyant knight in arms / Of these tidings was the noble queen
much reconforted^ and com^anded that they should ordeyne well for hem to ete
and drynke^ and did do couere the table^ and received this prusius right
solempnly / but when each was set at table / the fair myrro and Jason were in
such wise seruid by the refecco^n of love / that they took none head of mete ne
of drink / The messager of love that is to wete dou^^e Regard was continuelly
on the way / that on was shamefaste and changed color / and in like wise did
that other / Jason could not conteyne him self / and myrro perceived well ynow
his mayntenyng / but myrro was much subtle / for she beheld him raysonably /
and more did by wysedom than her heart desired / In these regardes and in
these semblances they pass^d the soupper / there was no lady ne damoyselle that
ne employed her eyes for to behold Jason for his great beauty what shall I say
more / after the soupper hit was ordained that on the morn the siriens which
were weary and trauaylled in coming theder should peste them / but the next day
following they should goo out under the conduyt of Jason for tassayle the siege
of the king of sklauonye / and than each man took leave and withdrewe him into
their logyse one and other and into her hosteleryes

Anon as Jason was withdrawn into his logys and leyde in his bed for to
rest / The souenau^ce of his lad^ pres^nted her into his memory / Which
enlumyned in him so tereyble a fire in the mids of his heart that him thought
he was in a brennyng fournayse. He began than first to thenke on the fayt of
his lady. And after he began to make castellis in Spaygne as lovers do / and
fina^ly when he had long labourd in thise things / he spack to him self / and
said softely. ha. a fortune / knight what shall befall of the and of this noble
lady hit behoueth^ that thou pray her of love / and than am I not hardy ynow
to do so / wherefore I will not / be what rayson she is good / but she
co^pryseth^ the bruyt of al^ the world / and that more is she hath^ refused a
king / certes I am well a fool for to thenke on her / ye trewly a fool / and how
well that I be a fool yet have I given to her mine heart / hit is heeris / and it
shall abide with her / the gentil damoyseau Jason thought the most part of the
night in this rederye amerouse / And after slepte / but he dremed of his lady.
for thenforcement of love / In like wise it must be said that she bleef not al
quyt / for incontinent as she was leyde in her bed / her thought that she saw
Jason flourisshing above all other men / Then^e she began to coueyte his love.
And desired the day that she might see him again. and so much she desirid him
during the night / that she began to say in this wise / Ha a obscure and derke
night wherefore endurest thou so long / it disples^th^ me oumoche. and not with
out cause. for I am in terrible pain be cause that the day tarieth^ so long
er he come. Ha a day where art thou / if thou were come I should see my love
and friend / my solace and conforte^ Certes thou make long soiournyng. by thy
tarieng mine eyes may not see my bewayling the desire of my heart /
thaccomplisshement of my wissh^s. the esperance of my ioye^ but what enjoy
have I / I may not sleep instead where I was wont to wisshe after the night
for to withdraw me fro the publicque affairs / now I must wisshe after the
day for to come to my singular playsir in a secret regard and sight

SVche or semblable were the words of the noble lady esprised of love / she
desired the preu Jason. and he coueyted her also. And in the same wise faylled
not the king of Esklauonye. for in the same night. the dolor and pain of his
wounds were to him so aspre that he might not rest. And then^e for to pass
with all more esily his pain. he began to bewaille the grace of his noble
lady / and fayde in this manner among all other words. Ha a dear lady shall ye
never have pity on my pour and desolate heart. the which notwithstanding your
reffuse and great Rudesse may not put you in oublian^ce ne out of his desir /
the which more and more you loueth^ / the which can not trauaille him self
ynowh^ for to find the manner to get your benyuolence and good will. And
whether hit plese you or plese you not hit is all youris^ O my desir if ye wole
always remain with out mercy^ wherefore were ever ye so habondantly garnisshid
so well of excessive and chief of all beaute^ your resplendour is clear among
the women^ as the son is among the sterres^ shall ye be without mercy and
without compassion. I suppose that ye shall not / an^ my heart Iugeth^ that ye
shall have great Regard unto my good will / The ladies other whilis take plaisir
for to make her true seruan^ts to languisshe. And their honor accordeth^ well
thereto / for in truth a lady to sone abandonned and given over. embraceth^
not great honour^ then^e hit is expedient that she suffer her lovers to tarry
by prayers and oroison^s / And in this manner I will conclude in my selfe^ not
only for one Reffuse / ne for ^xx^ of the grace of my lady / I will not fall
in despayr / The verray courage of a true lover may in no wise be known but
only by the moyen^ of many Reffuses. How well the stone is mined and holowed
by contynuell droppyng of water. And then^e shall not the Rigor and the
reffuse of my noble lady be mined and adoulced by my habondan^t prayers and
oroison^s. yes verily. that shall she be or nature shall faylle. And if not /
the gods shall be unjust and against me

How Jason befought a meruayllous Giant named Corfus and how he slew him in
the bataylle
IN these or semblable ymaginacions the Esklauon king passid all this night
unto the morn erly / that Corfus a meruayllous Geant born in Toscane c^m unto
him And demanded how he ferde / and how hit stood with him. Certes Corfus
answered the kyng^ For so much as I dreme of my loves. And that they occupye me
so sore. that they slay me because I occupye ^em somoche. and how well that I
find in her but reffuse and fierst^^. And h^we said Corfus thens^e ye yet on
her. ye said the king / That must needs be. Must hit needs said Corfus^ Ye
certes said the king. Than said Corfus / Ye be a fool and right evil aduysed^
For all thing considerid he is not wise that enforces him to have a wife a
boue h^s degree / for as much as there ben of other plente. Right well sa^d the
king. ye say Right well / but know not ye that some one is better and more
worth than sum five honderd. Certainly my lady is the oultrepasse of al other
ladies / ought I to leave her for her reffuse / ye said the grant ^f ye do
wisely / by my law said the king that shall neu befa^^ me for to deye in the
pain as her true servant / but that I hope to come to thaboue of mine
enterprise how that it be / Sire sai^^ Corfus I report me unto your symplesse^
But and ye will believe me ye shall beguy^^ her well^ Ye shall leave her for
such as she is said the Geant / and never whiles ye live love neu woman but
for one night ye may euy day have anew / there is none so great plaisir as for
to change often. Ha a Corfus said then^e the king / a true lover uses never
such terms as ye speak of. and when a prince may come to the love of a lady.
fair. true. discrete and a of good house. is not that ynouh^ for him / if he
that comes to such felicite and goth^ to change / certes he is worthy of
reproach Sire said the Geant Corfus. ne know ye no more then^e y^ say and
s^ewe / Certes there is well another point / and what is that said the king / I
shall say you said the Geant* Take ye the fairest lady that lives and be as
amourous over her as eu^rye can or may. Anon as ye have enjoyed her as litill
as hit may be / ye shall be weary and full of her. she shall seem to you foul /
and yet more I shall say you that sone ye shall wisshe her brend. And if ye be
a^ other men be ye shall leave her and take an other if hit be in your pu^ssau^^e

HA a Corfus said then^e the king / if I should believe your counceyll / I should
neu do well / and as to the Regard of me I wene that ye say to me th^se
thing. for to make me return into my country to the end that ye goo not to
the field against them that yesterday shed my blood. by my loyaulte said
then^e Corfus / sire all that I have said proceeds not for any fere ne dread
that I have of all your enemies. but I cou^ceyll you to my true power / for
asmoche as me sem^eth hit couenable for your hell the and prouffyte And to
the end that your wenyng be founden untrue / with out more delay / I shall
send your messager unto the noble Queen Myrro for to signefye her / that for
to mayntene the noble mestier of arms / I offer my self alloh against.viij^ the
best knights that been in the cite of oliferne For to fight in Champe cloos as
hit Apperteyneth in such as caas

When the king of sklauonye had herd thanswer of the Geant and perceived that
he was angry / he held his pees so long / that the geant went and armed him
in his tente / And syn put him on the way toward the Cite in the company of a
messager of the kings / whom he sent unto the queen Myrro right in such wise
as a fore is said / and when the messager had said that he had in charge / The
noble queen callid the more part of her knights and declared to them that the
Geant had demanded. Anon as they of Oliferne had herd the contenue of this
mandeme^t For as much as Jason and plente of other knights strau^giers that
were there gaf the honor for to speak first to them of the same co^tre for to
say their aduis of this work / They said all on hyhe that this geant Corfus
was he that by his force and vaillyau^ce had put to deth^ the most part of the
noblesse of Oliferne / and that hem seemed hit should be great folly for to
furnisshe the battle that he demanded / but of this answer were all the
knights strangers so abashed that they concluded to be conduyted by the
knights of Oliferne / Reseruid the noble and preu Jason / the which as he
that might not longer hold his noble courage to speak but said with so hyhe a
voys that he was well vnderstonden of all men in this manner

Fair lords displese you not / if the virtue of my courage know not now the
feblesse of my body / I know right well that I am not great ne me^bred as a
geant / neutheles I will well that hit be known that there is no gea^t that hath^
gretter heart then^e I have / And to this end that it appear euydently^ And
the noble lady where my heart and all my well Resteth^ may always here good
tydinges of me / I enterprise for to go fight against the Geant Corfus man for
man^. and I shall never rest unto the time that I have prouyd my self against
him / Then^e the noble lady the queen that tho was present having herd
thenterprise of the noble Jason / was so v^terly smyten^ with sorou. that her
seemed that she was smeten^ with a spear a trauers the heart / so much she
louyd Jason. nevertheless she held good contena^nce^ asmoche as to her was
possible. And Incontinent as Jason had declared there his courage. She said
to him / Jason fair sire beware what ye say / and see that your yongthe abuse
you not For if ye were you.xx. armed and in point for to fight know ye for
troth that he should never leave but abide you thawh^ ye had sworn^ his deth^

CErtes dear lady said Iason^ know ye that if yongth abuse me /
oultrequydance and presumpcion deceyueth the Geant / For to sle a man^ how
great or puyssau^t that he be there behooves but one stroke. well set / But
whether hit be of yron^ or of steell or of any other thing I doubt not but hit
shall come to point / When the noble queen Myrro had understand this that
Jason said. She wiste not what to answer What shall I make you long tale he
did do be said to the messager of the king of Esclauonye. that he would
befighte the Geant Corfus / and then^e when the noble Jason was armed with his
arms / he mounted on horseback and his spear on his thye and so departed from
the Cite / And adressid him toward the Geant which was right subtle in the
fayt of Arms and of the war / he had all his harnoys trussid and his horse
sad^^d and baydl^d

INcontinent as the Geant perceyuid that the vaillyau^t prince Jason came riding
unto him / he sterte upon his horse and came toward him / and by great felonnye
said to him / what sekest thou / to whom Jason said / Art thou Corfus / ye
ansuerd corfus / I am he trewly. Than know thou that thou art he that I seche
/ Thou said Corfus / ye trewly I said Jason / and what m^uith the so to do
said Corfus / co^siderest thou not the strength and force of my body and the
f^rour of my sword / and how I am cause of all the desolacion of Oliferne /
if me good seems I shall sese the by the heed and back thy neck / as the
neck of a che^en Thou tellest me meruaylles said Jason for to f^re and
abasshe the people / but for all that my courage changes not / our process
endures to long / go thy way and feche thy spear / and than show what thou
can do / thou have found aman for to furnisshe the / litil speking and well
werking / The g^ant with ^hese words went for to fe^ch^ his spear / And Jason
couerd him with his shield assewring him self in his sadell And when he had so
don and saw that the Geant smote his horse with his sporis and came against him
he ro^de toward him so corageously / that hit seemed more lyk thonder descending
from heaven than any other thing / and so smote the most fiersly that they could
or might / and their stroke^ were so peysau^t and heavy / that the sengles of
there sadles ^eake in so much that the noble Jason wa^ born unto the earth /
and the geant was reused with the sad^^ under the crupe of his horse / And of
the peysanteur of the two great strokes^ the raynes of his horse faylled and
his two legs behind in such wise as he tumblid the head under and the feet
upward at right great meschief

MAny knights of sclauonye and of Oliferne were greatly abasshid when they
apperceyued that Jason had received of the Geant Corfus oon^ so heavy and so
great a struck with out death or mayme. Jason and the Geant so born^ to the
earth and set a foot as said is Releuyd them self anon^ in their standing and
marchid oone against that other^ Then^e the strong Geant drew his good swerd
out of his ^hethe and escried Jason sayng. Vaissale or felawe thou have done to
me now the most gre^test dishonor that ever happend or came to me^ And
therefore keep thy self from my faytes the best wise thou may / For if the
arm with the good swerd faylle me not at this time. I shall confou^de the in
short time / And after I shall drink thy blood and ete thyn heart in despyte
of the dueyl and sorou that thou have done to mine heart / Ha a tyran^t
felonnous and oultrecuyda^nt ansuerde the noble preu Jason. what evil would
thou do. if hit held at no man^ / but at the^ Ce^tes hit happeth often times
that such menaces ben said of great fere and dread. And al is done for to save
his life But to the Regard of the and of al thy menaces I make no compte ner
doubt the in no thing. And in that thou say / of drynkyng my blood / and
etyng myn^ heart I shall kep^ the Right well by the aid and the help of the
goddes^ for to fall in such Inhumanyte or furour. And I hope where I have
angered the in thyn heart / that hit shall not be long to. but that thou shall be
angrid in heart in body. and in soul / Than that Corfus the right Cruel geant
had understand the words of Jason he left up his heed and chyn all chargid
with here / like a Beer. and after enhau^ced his trenchau^t swerd with a
great Courage right angry and smote Jason and gaf him so terryble and poyssau^t
stroke that he have a way more than a great quarter of his shield. And when
Jason felt him so smeton of the Geant. he left up his swerd a heyght where
with he araught his mortel ennemy upon the coppe of his helm in enployeng
all his might / that the Geant was constrained to enclyne his heed all low.
Whereof many had great marvel

As ye may Understand the two Champyons began to entretaste each other with
their trenchau^t swerdes All way the geant after that he had receyuid this
peysau^t struck / he hau^ced his hand with his swerd again and supposed to
have smeton Jason. But Jason which was light and delyuere and well auised in
his feet / drew him a part in such wise that the stroke of the Geant fylle on
the earth so depe^ that if he had araught him plainly he had confounded him.
Than the preu Jason which had so wyded him fro the stroke. stepped to the geant
And gaf him such a stroke upon the right sholdre that he brake his hauberk and
made him a great wounde^ Than Jason with^drewe his sword all blody. And when
Corfus the strong Geant felt that Jason had so hurt him. Certainly he wend
he should have goon out of his wit for asmoche as he saw the swerd of his
adversary was dyed with his blood. and was much angry / But Jason set
litil thereby / Saving he began a lytil to smyle and lawhe / And if he was glad
so were they of Olyferne that beheld the bataylle of the two champyons. But hit
was not long after but their lawhynges changed into wepynges^ For the geant as
all despayred Ran upon Jason so eygrely that he wist not how to save him / on
that other side he saw his shield all in pieces. And with that he gaf him a
wound upon the lift side that the blood ran down fro the wound largely /
Right long fought the two right vayllyant champyons that one against that othre
in so much that by fyn force they detrenched their sheldes by pieces. But than
when their sheldes were broken / hit was a good sight to see Jason the noble
knight how he delivered again the Geant Corfus so meruayllous bataylle gyuyng
to him s^moche travail in poursuyng him so besely that the Geant began to wax
weary in suffering so many strokes / and began strongly to sweet / Than for to
refresshe him self he must needs depart and leave to fight and smite Jason /
and to with^drawe him a part / When the worthy Jason apperceyuyd the manyere
of the Geant and that he sought for to rest him / he had great Joy. how well
he had as gladly Rested him as his aduersayre had. when he considerid in him
self. that he might Rest him and ease hym^ and that he was not hurt but in
one place / he approached to the Geant and said to him. Ha / a right miserable
tyrau^t Approach the toward me and late us perform and make an end of this
battle now begone. I perceive now right well that a bed for to rest the on
/ should be to the more plaisir then^e should a bataille or a stour to be
furnisshid. but I advertise the that hit behoueth^ us to come to the end of our
entreprise / And that there is no Remedy / And know that my courage has
brought and conduyted my body unto this point / But from hens forth my body
shall conduyte hit by the virtue of love. by which me thinketh^ that I feel my
puissaunce redouble when that I remember her / which above all other ought to
be best belouid of me. As she that is veraily without any excepcion

INcontinent that Corfus the crymynell G^ant had understand of the no^le
damoiseau Jason that he was so am^rous he began to say to him by great mali^e.
Certes right gentill. knight / I perc^yue right well that your heart is
prisoner in the mercy of som^e lady. I Require you in the name of her. and by
the faith that ye owe to her / that ye come and rest you beside me a litill.
And we shall devise us to geder of our auentures / Ha a right Recreant and weary
rybauld ansuerd then^e the noble damois^au Jason. Thou sek^st nothing more but
for to rest the. And if I accord to the thy request / hit is to my prejudice
for thou may no more. Notwithstanding in the name of my right high maistresse
I am content to do as thou have required But beware that thou rest not long /
With these words the Geant Corfus and the noble Jason satte doun^ upon the
grass / And after they began to devise / and the Geant Corfus said to him /
Right gentil knight as I understand ye ben amerous / hit may well be said
Jason / of whom is hit said the Geant / of a lady said Jason / what is she
said the Geant / The most fair of all fair ansuerde Jason Ye said the geant
as to your semblau^t. the world iugeth^ her so ansuerde Jason. Ha. a sir
knight said the Geant / ye be a great sole / for perauenture ye saw never
your lady And ye say and name her for the most fair of all other And yet
that worse is. ye hold her for youris / and hit is possible that she is
longyng to moo that an honderd How many ben there of them that been not double.
I louid not long syn a Lady right fair to mine aduise^ But she is foul right
terribly / Men preyse and allow much the fair Myrro. But I trow who beheld
her well round abeute^ there should be founden somewhat of Reprehencion H^. a
right dysloyall traytre answered than Jason / how dare thou by thy great
oultrage to th^nke evil upon the flour of all ladies. which had so much /
of bounte of beaulte / of wit / And which is garnisshyd of so many hyhe and
noble virtues / and is a verray myrrour unto all other. wherefore by the fayth^
that I owe unto love er over I ete or drink thou shall abye it / Stand up
lightly on thy feet and keep the from me if thou think good

THe noble and gentil knight Jason aroose with these words all enflamed of
Ire and maltalent / And took forwith^ his swerd that lay on the grass all
blody^ The Geant roose also. but hit was not lightly / For his legs were
Royde like a voyager that had all the day to fore / have voiaged or goon a
Journey. and than Jason came and smote him upon his lift arm and so employed
all his puyssau^ce that he departid the arm fro the body in such wise that he
fill down to the earth. Than the Geant by right aspre distress made a
meruaillous and righ^t horrible crye^ After this as one full of a terrible
courage hau^ced his sword swering by all his gods that he would avenge him.
but he wiste not how he might sewe Jason for so much as he was light and
deliuere and able well knowing the tour of his strookes in such wise as he
always defended him vaillian^tly and distourned the struck of his swerd That
his enemy sought all way and could never attain to reche him. And in this
wise the bataille dured long in so much that the son began to deuale in to
the weste^ But the noble preu Jason among many strokes enuertued him self by
such vailliau^ce in smyting upon the Geant Corfus with his trenchan^t sword
that he araught him on the highest of his helm.iij. strokes one after an other
in one place that at the third stroke he enfondrid and to frusshid his helm
and the coyffe into the heed / in such wise / that of the great anguisshe that
the geant suffrid. that he fylle doun^ a swou^ne upon the sand seeing all they
of Oliferne And of that other part the Esclauons which were soroufull and
abasshid

INcontinent as the worthy Jason had slain and smyton^ doun^ the Geant to the
earth as said is. he dishelmed him / but he fond that he was dede^ wherefore he
left him there lyeng / And in sign of victory he seasid his sword. And
after went unto his horse / whom he fond pasturing^ But he had no leyser to
sadle him because of many Esclauons that he saw meue for to come and ren^e
upon him. Then^e he seasid his horse by the brydel and without sadle sterte
upon him^ And for all doubts he withdrewe in to the Cite as soon as was
possible for him whereof the Esklauons had right great despyte. And than when
they apperceyuid that they gate naught in pourfuyng of Jason for they were all
a foot / they withdrewe hem to Corfus whom they found ded. for whom they were
gretely disconforted in so much that hem seemed that all her trust and hoope
was lost and goon. And among all other when the king knew the mysauenture of
his Geant / he was so sorouful that of all the even after he spack not one
word / For he had great aff^au^ce in his strength / in his great hardynesse.
and in his Entrepryse

Great and meruayllo^s was the s^rowe that the ^yng of Esklauonye and his men
demened for the death of the strong Geant Corfus. And on the contrary the
Queen Myrro and all they of the cite of Oliferne demened great Joy and made
right Joyous chiere for the noble vyctorie of Jason. Than the Queen Myrro
accompanied of a great nombre of ladies and of damoysell^s of knights and
squyers came to the gate against Jason esprysed with such gladness and
consolacion that hit can not be spoken / And anon as Jason espied her / he
sprang down of his horse and made to her the Reverence / and after presented to
her the swerd of the Geant / And said Madame lo here is the swerd that your
knigh^tes have so much doubted here to fore / behold hit well / and do with
all your playsir / Than the noble lady ansuerd to Jason / right exellent knight
/ thanked be the gods that by your h^he entrepryse and vaillyau^ce have this
day deliuerid the Cite and all the people of Oliferne of a meruaillous dread and
fere / And syn that the crymynell Geant Corfus is deed / All the Remenaunt as
who saith^ is as good as vaynquisshid / and therefore come ye unto our palais.
and we shall do visit your wounds by our Surgyens / which shall ordeyne
right well and diligently for your health

THen^e was the noble Jason brought unto the palace with great loenge and
preysinges of the ladies and damoyselles of the knights and of the people of
the cite of Oliferne / The wedowes bewailled greatly because he was not erst
comen for the loss of her husbondes / they that were mari^d reioysed and were
glad of his coming. They that were disconforted and desolate recoured their
courage all new / For in the vailliau^ce and in the high virtues of Jason
rested all their hope. In his strength^ they took affian^ce / In his wit they
trusted / In his vaillyaunce they were Reconforted. And in his good fortune
consolate. Certes hit seemed to them then^e / that they were deliuerid from the
pains of hell and brought into paradys What shall I more say the fair Myrro
thought and dremed often times of Jason / as of the knight that she louyd most
of the world. The preu Jason was three days long in the palace without any
arms beryng / And during these three days the fair Myrro went often times unto
him / hoping that Jason should have required her of love / which he had
gladly doon^. but as cremetous and doubting the recountres of Reffuse. durst
in no manner touch that matere ne make any semblau^t to her ne to none other

ON the fourth day than when the nobles of Oliferne knew that Jason was hole
of his hurtes / and might well bear Arms / they assembled and came unto the
Queen Myrro and said to her^ Madame ye have well cause for to reioye your self /
if a heart Infortunat after grief upon grief may resourdre when fortune will
favor and aid / We and your cou^ceylle have often times behold and seen /
the Right hyhe prowess and dyscrete conduyte of your knight Jason. Certes hit
may well be said / that his like was never founden^ hit seems to us / that
fortune hath^ brought him unto your hands. for to resuscyte and Reyse yow^ for
to take veng^aunce of the over great euyllys and meschy^u^s / that has been
done to you and your men during this war. And for many Raysons we cou^ceylle
you. that ye ordeyne and constytute the said noble Jason Capytayne of this
Royaume and Chief of your war. For we think so much noblesse in him. that
he shall never have rest in his courage unto the time / that he have chassed
away your mortell enemies out of your Royaume / and brought them to
dysconfiture

HIt is to wete / whether the noble queen Myrro was right Joyous in her heart /
when she herd so hyghly Recomended him that she most louid above all the men
of the world. hit is no meruaylle thawh^ she so were and dehonayrly she
acorded the Request that the nobles and her conceyll had made to her. And
forthwith^ she sent for Jason / and in the presence of them that had made the
request as before is said / she constituted him Captain general of all her
royaume / Then^e Iason^ remercyed and thanked the noble Queen Myrro of the
honor that she had done to him / And also the nobles and her cou^ceyll for
their good pourchace / In excusing greatly him self of nonhabilite Sayng that
he was not propice ne worthy of so hye charge and honor to enterprise / But
all they that there were present said. That notwithstanding his excusacions.
they would have none other Captain but him^ And that he should be it / as
far as he would not disobeye the noble queen Myrro^ They shewid him so many
demonstran^ces that he enterprised and took upon him the charge / And that same
ou^e the noble Queen Myrro deliuerid unto the noble damoiseau Jason all that
was necessary to him and ordained his estate / And when the noble preu Iason^
felt him in this honor so high set in his astate / he sent forth^ with to
the king of Esclauonye / com^andyng him to depart he and all his ooste from
thens. And that anon he should void the royame of Oliferne. or ellis on the
morn^ betymes he should dispose him and make him ready to be receyuyd by bataille

When the puissau^t king of Esclauonye understood that Jason had so send him
his man^dement^ he had right great meruaille / how well he ansuerde to the
heraulde that he had not entencion for to disloge him ne to Reyse his siege.
and that he would erst have at his com^andement the noble Queen Myrro for to
do with her his will / and sent word again unto the noble preu Jason. that
also dear as he had his life / he should keep him that he came not in his
presence. And if he came in his hands. he should do him deye a miserable death

Incontinent as the noble preu Jason had understood this answer. he did to
publisshe in all the quarefours of the Cyte^ That all they that were of age to
bear arms should be ready on the morn^ erly for to goo with him for to enuahye
and fight with their enemyes^ And thus passid that day unto the night / That
Jason then^e began to thenke on the great honor and charge that he had
receyuid^ And then^e when he was withdrawn in to his chamber contynueng in his
amorouse pensees and thoughtis He began to say by him self in this manner / Ha
a my dear lady how have ye don to me this great worship / and given to me more
goods then^e apperteyneth to mine astate. and how shall hit be possible to
nombre the excess of b^unte / of clerenes of beaulte with all other virtues
that been in you I ought not to meruaille if your right exellent beaulte
draweth^ to your love the corages of strange Princes. for ye be adressid in all
bountees / the most fair creature and the most discrete that God and Nature
ever forumed The right most p^rfayt that is ougwher. how should hit be then^e
but if ye were beloved of all folk / Certes ye are worthy that the air be
replenisshid with callinges and of voyses cryeng after you and requyreng your
grace and mercy / Ha a ye that be so much exellent and virtuous. That all my
thoughts and Imagynacions ben turned And given to you that are of so much hye
valor. Not witstanding I shall not absteyne me to love your noble person /
For I shall the better prospere and be of the more value

IN such or semblable words the preu Jason passid the most part of the
night / and unto morn erly The day apperid fair and clear. And anon after in
short time after the death of the Geant Corfus / Jason and the syriens adoubed
them. And assemblid them of the Cite to fore the palace of the Queen Myrro. and
than when Jason saw and knew that his people were set in ordenaunce / he
went unto the fair Myrro and said to her in this manner. Madame pray ye for
your knight / the which above all thing desires. that he might do that
things that might be you right agreeable. and profitable to you and your Cite
/ Certes right excellent and vay^lyau^t knight answerde the Queen Myrro / ye ar
much preysed and hyghly recom^ended of my men. And for so much I pray you /
that in this Iourneye ye have good courage for to defend my quarele which is
good and Just / And as to the Regard of my self. I put mine Armee and my men
under the conduyte of your preudho^mye and your wysedom. Prayng unto the
gods That they will make your fortune to shine clear. and tenhaunse my good
quarele

how by the hye vailliau^ce of Jason / the king of sklauonye and his ooste were
desconfited and him self slain tofore oliferne
THus as the noble queen spack and admonestid the worthy knight Jason and his
men to do well and fight vayliantly in defending her just and good quarele /
Jason began to behold her so ardantly that she was ashamed how well that she as
wise and discrete held honest manner / and than the noble Jason after the
leave and congie taken as well of her as of the ladies and damoiselles departed
from the palace with great bewailinges^ and mounted on his hers. But there were
many of the ladies and Damoiselles of the court that began to bewepe him /
Prayng unto the gods to give him good adventure / And they said one unto an
other that hit should be great do^mage if to him came any fortune other then^e
good / And that they had never seen none so courtoys ne so gracious. And that
he was the very sourdre and well of noblesse. Anon then^e as the noble preu
Jason was on horse back he set his men in right fair ordenau^ce. and after
set hem on the way toward the field And the people by all the way that he
passed knelid down tofore him and prouoqued the gods unto his aid and help.
And then^e when he was comen into the field he assembled all his folk and
put hem in fair ordenau^ce of bataylle. And then^e when he had required them
instantly and amonested them to do well / he did do march them against their
enemies which abode them a foot Rengid and righ^t well ordained / At the
menyng Jason did do sown trompettis / tabours / and corns sarasins^ buysines
/ and other instruments so melodiously that hit seemed that they had goon^
unto a wedding or marriage or som^e great feste / And thus tryumphing of one hye
will medlid with Joy desiring to do well. Rejoicing them self singulerly in
the vailliau^ce and good conduyte of the righ^t worthy and noble knight Jason
they approached in such wise their mortell enemies that they began to couche
their good speris and begin the stour. And in that same time as the king of
Sklauonye held his men in Array a meruayllous great Raven came fleyng over his
heed cryeng right horrybly

INcontinent as the king of Esklauonye herd such a cry he began to tremble
for Ire and be in a great agonye / and looked after the Raven and said. O ever
hard and trembling hope / This maketh^ me to en^re in to frenesye For this
foul is messag^r of deth^ or of right evil adventure / and this is an e^yll
sign / for I feel my veins all void of blood / Ha / a my dear lady what
shall I now do / ^ertes I sha^ never put me to reprouche for to flee / I had
^euer deye and let here my life / than ever should be rehers^d to you of me any
dishoneste tydinges / Certes all they that were thoo about him were sore
abasshid / and not without cause. But nevertheless they reconforted them self
the best wise they might. and anon was made than on both sides a meruayllous
cry with which they marched that one against that other. And began by the
Archers and arblasters the battle so aspre that the Air was derked and
obscurid with the quarrels and arowes and stones that flewe so thikk. And made
with their Cries a great br^^t right meruaillous

THe vayllyau^t knight Jason was in the formest front of his people holdyng
his bow in his h^nd where with he let floe Arowes upon his Enemies largely.
But at last the shot lassed^ And when Jason saw that / he sterte upon his
horse and took his sheld and his spear In escry^ng O^^ferne by three times / And
smote his horse with his sporis and thrested into mids of his enemies so
swiftly. that prusus ne the siriens could not follow him at the beginning /
Then^e when hit came to breking of speris / the king of Toscane and the king of
bongye knew him anon^. wherefore they ran^ against him. sayng that they would
avenge the deth^ of the strong Geant corfus And both vailliau^tly smote him
tronchonyng their speris upon his shield / with out endomagyng his shield /
but hit is well to believe that the noble preu Jason failled net at this first
cours^ for he smote the king of bongye by such radeur that he left him out of
his arson^s / and bare him there unto the earth. And so passid forth / and
then^e came against him the king of Poulane. but that was to his evil health /
For Iasons spear trauersid his shield his hauberk and the body all to breking
his spear. And then^e came on unto the bataille Prusus acompanyed of his
knights That meruaillously mayntened them self in ensewing the faytes of Jason
/ and thus began one and other to show them self with right great effusion^
of blood on both parties. But much more of them of Esclauonye / then^e of
them of Oliferne

INcontinent that the noble Jason had broken his spear he griped in his hand
his good swerd that was clear and trenchan^t / And pretending that men should
speak of his faytes and vaillia^^ces / he adressid him on that part where he
saw the banyer royal of Esclauonye And supposed to have entrid there upon his
enemyes^ but they held hem thikke to geder. and cast and smote upon Jason right
asprely / And Jason upon them by such virtue that he effou^dred plente of
their heedes / detrenched their sheldes and slew great nombre of good knyghte^
For the vayllyau^t Prusus and his knights aborded than there in suyng Jason at
every stroke bathed his swerd in the blood of his enemies / And did so great
fete of Arms on all sides that they that beheld him and his mayntene /
callid him death and said / Certes the death assaylleth us having the form and
habylement of a knight Flee that wole his sureur and his trenchau^t swerd / For
whom he arecheth shall never after see fair day

Jason thus in this while did Arms at his will For he being on his horse made
the sklauon knights march a foot and many other with out nombre / one and
other said that his body was all of stele / And that he was noman mortal /
but that he was a thing of that other world / For hit seemed to his adversaries
that they had no spear ne sword that might enter in to his body What shall I
say unto you / he did so well that by vyue force with his trenchau^t sword
he brake the wards and Array of the Esklauons and came unto the banere of the
king Esklauon where he was acompanied with xxx. knights that rengid them for
the guard of the baner But incontinent when they saw the swerd of Jason ready
for to smite on them / The most asseured of them began to tremble /
Nevertheless they set hem in array and took their sheldes / haunced their
swerdes / and attended freely and fast a foot / the preu Jason and his folk
that followed him^ And than Jason swym^yng in a new courage by great playsir and
appetite for to get good loos and good Renom^e smote in among tho knights
that withstode him with al their puissau^ce / And then^e in this manner began
again the bataille and a meruaillous stour^ in so much that on all sides men
might see knights slay each other^ sheldes to break and fle in pieces /
hauberes dismailled / helmes broken and blood spring out of their wou^des and
fall upon the earth.

CErtes the noble preu Jason had there much to do and suffer as well for to
keep his men in array / as for to enu^ye and assaille his enemyes^ for his
shield was smyten in many pieces^ his armures were adommaged in many places.
This notwithstanding he enuertued him self defending. would never cesse. til he
came unto the b^nere of the king of Esclauonye / and to the knight that bare
the ban^re he gaf a struck so dismesurably that he clefte his h^de unto the
chyn^. And fill doun^ deed fro his horse to the ground and the baner also in
the presence of the king of Esclauonye / The which anon as he perceived that
stroke withdrewe him a part / and one of the knights went for to auan^ce and
Releue the banere. but the noble preu Jason made of him as he did of that
other / And after that he brack and all to rent the banere in pieces at the
horse feet. This done he began to smite on the right side and on the lift side
/ And then^e the Esclauons lost courage and vailliau^ce. And on the contrary
they of Oliferne s^eyng the good conduyte of their captain began to grow
better and better in such val^ir that as many of their enemies as they met /
they slew with their swerdes. And so in the end hit happend that as the
noble Jason Ran^ here and there he reco^tred the king and slew him with one
s^roke that he gaf him with his swerd. Than the Esklauons all discon^orted and
despayred as they that had no more esperance ne hope to obtain the vyctorie
escryed sayng Late us flee and save our self. for all is loste^ for the king
is deed / with which cry they turned their back and put hem to flight and
dysaroye. how well that they were yet more than.v.M. And than the vaillyau^t
Capytayn Jason and all his battle poursiewed them chacyng and sleing them out
of the Royame of Oliferne. This don the Noble Jason and his company Returned
unto the place where the Esklauons had hold their siege / and there they
found richesses plente. and than when they had departed their gayn and butin
as hit apperteyneth unto such a ^^as to every man his part after his
condition. The right valiant Jason comau^ded to trusse the tents and pauileu^s
of his enemies And than he and his company Returned in to the cite as
Vainqueurs with much great glory and Triumph

THe fair Myrro came than to mete with Jason garnisshed with a gracious
maintene. And made to him the grettest honor and reverence that was to her
possible. leding him unto her palace / where he entrid with great pain. for
the people was assemblid there ^n all parts about him in a meruayllous nombre
for to see him And cried all with an hyhe voys sayng. Now is returned again
victorious our defendour. our swerd / our health and all our esperau^ce^ which
hath^ only in him self more of vaisselage than is in all Esklauonye / and ought
to be honored and Recomanded above all other. Certes the noble Jason was
fested this night and Recomended of such and semblable loenges of them of
Oliferne / which made in the streets daunses and esbatemens thanking their
gods And always Jason was more and more in the grace of the ladies / For the
best born the most fair the best accomplisshed and the most special fyxed
their love in him / All were Ialouse of him / But Jason never thought on none
of them / but only / upon the seulle and oultrepassed beauty of the virtuous
Myrro / which always was in his memory And all they had wondre and marvel
of the beauty graciousete wit and perfeccion of Jason. And for to abregge
this story the vaillyau^t and oultrepreu Jason was in this glory and tryumphe
unto mydnight which than withdrewe him. And when he was withdrawn in his
chamber ^^^reentred in to his Reuerie of love as he had been to fore
acustomed. And set all^ in oublie and forgeting the poysau^t and dangerous
strokes that he had that day recey / uid in the bataylle against the Esklauons
whereof his body was right sore / and concluded in him self that on the morn he
would declare his courage unto the lady. But when the day was come and when he
came to fore her. he felt him self so sore surprised with love that he wiste
not what to say / And thus he drof forth long and many a day that he for all
his hardines of Arms / his sweet speech ne his strength could not auaylle in
gyuing him hardiesse / for to discouere his courage unto his lady. wherefore on a
night he being in his bed began to blame him self. and said softely to him
self in this manner

WHat may prouffiten the contynuell bewailinges that I make for my lady / I am
not a ferde when I find me in a troublous bataille of an honderd thousand men^
/ but when I suppose to speak to my lady / I tremble for feere and dread and
wot not what to say. for tofore her I am as al rauisshid / in like wise as a
pour and shamefast man that suffers to dye for honger rather then^e for shame
he dar beg his breed / O what vergoigne proceeds of such shamefastnes / I
speak to my self allone and I answer / Often times I am advised that to morn^ I
shall do meruayles and so I conclude right well / but when it comes for to be
done I have no memory ne remembran^ce of all my conclusions / Am I not then^e
well simple / when unto the most fair. the most sage. the most discrete and the
most virtuous of all other. I have no hardynesse for to say my desire and will
/ how well my heart iugeth that I am somewhat in her grace / but now comes upon
me an other judgment / and me seems that she well neu acorde to my requests /
O right noble and nonparaille Mirro. she is with^out peer / as the rose among
thorns. Alas and what shall I do without you / I have made a p^sente to you of
my heart and my will / if I understood that ye were born^ in a constellacion
enpesshing you of thinfluence of love / and that love had no power tesproue
upon you his virtues I would not enploye my time for to thenke on you^ but when
me seems that so great habondan^ce of thexcesse of beauty naturell as youris
is^ it may not be but that it is entremedlid of love of pite and of mercy / it
must needs be that your humble friend be rauisshed in the contemplaco^n of your
gloriouse value. desiring your good g^ce wisshing your alian^ce. and requiring
the gods and fortune that of you and me they make oon hows and one head where
we might enbrase the sovereign playsirs of this w^^lde and plainly find
amerouse felicite

THe preu Jason with thise words fill a sleep / and after he awoke so
alumyned with the fire of love that hit was to him inpossible to take his rest
/ but to turn and walowe and trauaille in his bed / And there as love thus
assaylled him agayn^ he determined utterly that he would adventure him to speak
to his lady. what that eu happen thereof. And so he did / for the same day he
came unto her and said in this wise. Madame I have seruid you as well as to me
is possible for two causes / Principally that one for thacquite of cheualerye /
And that other not for to disserue the richesses that ye have under the power
of fortune / But allonly that singular thing that nature has made you lady of
and upon which fortune has puissau^ce / Madame ye have don to me plente of
curtoysies / And offered great yeftes of monoye. whereof I thank you / how well I
hold them but of litil extime / for couetise of avarice have not alumed me of
their fire / I demand not the great tresours that been in the abismes of the
see^ ner them that been enclosed in the montaignes / my desir restith in two
singular things / that one is for to conquer name in arms / which ought to
be thappetite of the vocacion of all noble hertes That other is to obey unto
the com^au^dements and plaisau^ces of love that binds / and obliges me to be
youris / for to thenke on you / to attend and abide your beniuolence to do
thing that may playse your eyes and your heart

Alas my dear lady all good and honor comes of you / and if ye be all my
deport and fortune. And the gods have suffrid me to have do thing digne of
amerouse merit in your favor. put not ye your heart in disco^gnysau^ce / by
the which your noble royaume is put in pres / Receive hier to your man true
friend and l^uar your knight / and the right humble and obeyssau^t heart / of
whom the body secheth with all your plaisirs to obey him that has made al his
tr^sour of your beauty / fro the our that the good fortune brought me hither
unto your presence / I was and have been in all points ready to live and dye for
you in your service / in which I took arestan^ce. I submysed pres^ly my neck
to bear the fardell of your war / ye know how I have born^ it / Ha a my dear
lady have mercy on me / I supplye you humbly for asmoche as never true louar
required his lady with more desire and affecco^n in all honor and curtoisye

THe preu Jason cessed then^e his request in beholding the fair Myrro right
amorously. the which (...) him with a glad will. but this notwithstanding she
made no manner semblau^t / but for asmoche as to prove it Jason was asmoche
affected in love as in arms. she ansuerde to him as hit follows sayng^ Certes
fair sire Jason I know that ye be he that have discharged my royame of them
that ete and destroyed the substan^ce. and which would by force have ocupied
and wasted hit. And so I will not say but that ye be right digne of great
merit. And that your thank and reward ought to be yolden unto you. But unto
the regard for to require me of love. me seems ye have much to far
enterprised / ye know well ye ar none other but a knight / what might say the
kings and hye Princes of whom I have late made refuse / If I gafe me to you.
how well mine entencion is not in no wise to blame you But unto the end that ye
lose not your time / I auise to seche oughwher ellis your party. And than do
ye wisely And I require you to be content her with / for I know no better
remedy for your appaysement

ALas my dear lady answerde Jason / Remember you that my heart is such that can
chiese by no way none other lady in love but you. Certes that shall not be unto
the time that the fysshes flee in the air. And that the birds swym^e in the
water. My friend said the lady unto the Regard for tendende to take a thing
difficile. is no great prudence. ye be meure in your young age as towching Arms
/ But beware that ye put you not in so parfou^de an error that ye can not
easily come out / Certes I love you more than ye wene. I am ready for to y^lde
you your merit for the great goodness that ye have don to the cite of oliferne
/ I pray you that ye require me no more from hens forth^. And late this suffice
you. Ha / a madame ansuerde Jason than. how may I have suffisaunce when I may
not find grace to fore your noble vysage. of which right indigent and not
satisfied I remain. ye daigne not to condescende to my prayers. hit is now
your plaisi^ that I fall in despair / but syn hit goth^ so and that ye will
have no compassion of a true knight that has been youris. and the deffendour
and the hand that has obtained the peace for your royame / and the propre arm
that hath^ taken vengeance of your ancient forfaiteurs and enemies / al
dispaired I deperte prayng unto the gods that will enlumine you with pite and
mercy as they know that is nedeful for you^ and unto all our gods I
com^ande you

How that Jason after that he had required the queen mirro of love deperted
all disconforted from oliferne / and how she went after him
With this conclusion the preu Jason all in a trau^ce and half rebuqued went
unto the ladies and damoiselles And the fair Myrro and one woman which was
secret with her deperted fro thens / but the queen entrid allone into her
chamber / thinking much on Jason / which at that time comen among the ladies
as said is with an heart sorouful and enuyro^ned with displaisir / thanked them
greatly of the great curtoisie that he had fonden in them / and in this point
took leave reco^manding him self in their good grace. After deperted thens unto
his stable and com^anded to sadle his horse And after that he sent for his
arms and adouled him / and forthwith without any more speech how well it was
nygh^ night. he rode forth out of the cite. and was so angry and desplaisau^t
that he wist neu whither to become / and when the ladies saw that Jason
deperted from the cite so allone and dysconforted thinking on the virtues where
in he was endowed they conplayned him much / and said one to an other that he
had not his heart in ease / Many of them bewailed him in such wise that the
great teres fill down from their eyes / and among them there was one that knew
somewhat of the secrets of the queen / and she having seen Jason taking his
horse all armed and depart out fro the cite came unto Myrro all bewept as she
was and said to her in this manner

MAdame what eyleth your knight or sudden chance may come to him to depart
out of your cite armed and allone at this our have ye sent him into any place
hit semeth^ that he hath^ his heart oppressid with aspre dueil and sorowe^
Certes bele answerde the Queen / I wot not what him eyleth. but I trow right
well that he is not all at his ayse. for in recompensing of the good services
that he has don to me in this war / he has desired and required me of love.
and for asmoche as I have not acorded to him his request / he is departed from
me all angry / and more kn^we not I. Madame than said the damoyselle. gaf ye
to him no manner hope ne esperau^ce at his departing. certes I gaf to him none
said the lady^ And how said the damoiselle ^ ye have said to me more than
a^M^ times to fore this time that he was the only desir of your heart / I
confess that to you said the queen / for yet my love is set on him
merueyllously / and bear alwey in my souenau^ce his great beauty and his well
doings / Ha / a madame ansuerde than the Damoyselle Why have ye than ansuerd
him so coldely and refusingly / certes said the lady / I wot never why / but
that I was so abasshid and so chauffed in my blood / when I understood that he
required me of love that I wist not to answer. and also by mine advise mine
honor requires that at this first request / I should hold me strange and
not tabondon^e my self For they that at the first request of their lovers
agree to them / ought to be ashamed^ For as much as the more part of men have
no verite ne loyaulte as to the Reg^rd of love. And also there be many that can
none otherwise do but serve ladies and gentilwomon with lies and deceytes My
mother told me and bad me keep this lesson when she sent me first to scole /
if I have well retained her doctrine me thinks I have non done much amys^ for
the thing that is gotten by great travail and long requests is much more
worth and better kept^ then^e that is gotten lightly. Certes that lady that of
her love is required / can do no better then^e to hold her strange and be
much required

MAdame ansuerde the Damoiselle I accord much to that ye say to me / but
there is in all thing manner / how well that there be many men that pray and
require ladies of their love asmoche as they may / making lesinges and false
oaths that can not be counted. but certes madame this noble and valiant knight
Jason is not in mine aduys no thing like as to the compte of other / and after
that I understand by your words ye have sent him from you all hountouse and
shamed / in so much as I deem that he is goone in such wise as he came hither
/ For at his departing he came and took leave of the ladies. wherefore I am in
doubt that ye shall never see him more. And is he goon as ye say said then^e
the lady. ye certes said the damoisell / he is certainly goon^ By what place
and by which gate. That wot I not said the damoisell / but I trow better
that he is returned into his country then^e to any other place

When the noble Queen Myrro understood this that said is / and that she had a
litil remembrid her self of the departing of her dear love and friend. she fill
doun^ to the earth as all thurgh^ smyten and tronchoned with amerouse sorrow
and dueil / she began then^e to wrynge her hands and to smite with her feet
sayng not passing lowde^ Alas. Ala^ Fortune is to me hard Alas and what have I
done my self evil auisid when I was required of love of the most Renomed
knight of all the world. of the most vaillyau^t in arms. of the fairest that
lyueth^. And that I have not humelyed my self with his right great humylite /
I have made refuse of my right great well and of my grettest ewre and hap.
Certes I could not keep in mine house the good fortune that the gods of their
secret tresour of their grace had sent to me and brought and planted in my
hands By my litil advise and entendement I have chaced out of Oliferne him
that hath^ rescowed and brought hit again fro mortal encombran^ce by the hye
valiau^ce of his person and the travail of his body with the precious prys
of his blood And then^e what have I do. Ha a my heart what have thou consented.
my month^ what haste thou voided. my tongue what have thou proferred^ And mine
entendement where were thou / where was thy force or thy puissau^ce / or thy
will / that desiring the love and thalyan^ce of him that was abandon^ed to the
which had thy monthe closed for shame^ And have suffered the corporal and
bodily mou^th^ to deny that thing. that thou approuedest to seche above all
other thing O right pour shamefastnes / ye hou^touse shamefastnes^ in what
ploye or in what press am I now by thy cause. Certes I am ashamed that I have
refused thalyan^ce of my friend and of my domycille. But certes I shall amend
hit to my power / I shall goo after him so far til I shall find him / And I
shall have no shame to put me in his mercy

When the young damoisell aperceyued the great displaisi^ where in her^
maistresse was / she shitte the chamber door to the end that no person should
come upon them / and begone there to weep til night. and that a lady came
knocking at the door and said that the soupper was all ready / than the queen
did do answer her by the damoyselle^ that she wlde not souppe / for so much
as she felt her not well disposed / and also commanded that no person should
come to her that night Which answer so made / the Queen and the damoyselle
began to make new bewailinges and teeris and after began to bewail Jason. and
among all other things the Queen said these words. yet may there worse
adventure grieve me more / for after an over much dangerouse inconvenience she
sends to me the deth^ / Ha a late me sorrow / but what shall I mow do. I
wot never what to thenke. and what ought I to do by your faith^. seem ye good
that I ought to goo after him^ or that I send any faithful man after him of
my knowleche^ Certes I think if I should send a messager after him that he
would not come again / And if I went my self after him / that should be to me
the grettest dishonor of the world. Madame ansuerde than the damoiselle ye
ought to know your caas^ and of two ways to take the best / If ye have
intencion that Jason be your husbonde / hit behoueth^ no longer to soiourne.
for ye must go or send unto him with all diligence^ and for to say to you
mine opinion. if hit were so happend to me as it is to you I would send none
other messager. but my self / And know ye verily that ye may have no
dishonor for to goo after him vnderstonden and well considerid the good and
agreeable services that he hath^ don to you and to your royame^ for under the
color for to guerredone and reward him / ye may take occasion to come into
words and to give him some matere yet for to serve you^ Certes fair daughter
said the queen / I wot not what to think what me is best to do / for if I
goo after him and find him. what shall I say / My dear lady ansuerde the
damoiselle. as I have right now said ye shall present to him the guerredon of
the great honor and good service that he has don to you in your necessite.
this thinks to me litil substance for to enter into speech of my pryncipal
cause said the queen / Certes madame answered then^e the damoisell^. when ye
shall come and be to fore the knight / love shall teache you to speak / if ye
will record the lessons and epistles of love by the space of ten year. it shall
but litil prouffite to your auancement / for there lacketh^ nothing but
thinspyracion of love medlid with hardynesse and of humayne entendement.
spekyng with the month^ which is instrument of the dischargyng and
discovering of hertes / Syn that it is so said then^e the fair myrro queen of
Oliferne^ All thing considerid I had much lever to couere a litill blame.
then^e that I should in all points with out ever to recouere again all the
hole desire and playsir of my heart. and the consolacion of myn^ eyes / then^e
I shall say to you mine advise / that hit is need and necessite so to do. and
that ye must now goo unto my women^ and say to them. that to morn^ betymes I
shall goo in pilgremage accompanied of you only / And that they take heed and
see well to all things. And ye and I tofore the son rising shall enterprise
in the most secret wise that shall be possible our enqueste upon the most
noble and vailliau^t knight / the most fair / and the most adressed that is
liuing^ That is Jason mine only friend. and we shall do so much that he shall
be founden. This advise seemed right good unto the Damoyselle / the which with
all diligence obeyed to the comau^deme^t of her maistresse / and after these
things about midnight. they made ready her things and on the morn erly tofore
day. both they took each a good palfroye in habit unknown and rode forth^ on
their way. and such was their adventure that they came for to bayte in the
logging where her friend Jason had logged that night. And than she began to
demand of the host of thaffaire and contenance of the knight and what chere
he had made the even to fore^ and at his departing what way he had taken and
hold. And the hooste ansuerde to the lady. that as to the regard of his chere
and thaffaire of the knight^ he had nether eten ne dronken in all the evening
/ And as to the way that he had holden^ he enseigned to the lady. which was
than much pensif for Jason. that had not that evening taken no Refeccion of
mete ne of drink

THe noble Queen Myrro and her damoyselle tarried than not long at that bayting
/ for they took their horses and rood as hastily as to hem was possible and so
roode ^iij days long after Jason / hering in every logise where they descended
tidinges of him / but they could not outaken ne find him / And on the fourth^
day fuyng they came unto a port of the sea / where was shewid unto them a ship
where in were merchants of athenes / and was told to them that Jason was therein
and that he would go to athenes and furthermore if they would go there was yet a
ship of other marchan^s that was on the point to depart / but then^e the fair
Myrro was in such a point of displaisir when she knew that Jason was departed
that she made great sorowe^ This notwythstanding she was anon^ conseylled what
she would do / and concluded syn that she had so much traueyled that she
would prove dame fortune. and went after Iason^ with this conclusion all full
of aspre sighinges she went* to the ship that should disancre for to go to
Athenes and agreed with the maron^er which was brought theder by force of
tempest and wind and anon^ they disancred and deperted / and when they saw
that it was calm and blewe not^ they made ready their oores and rowed by the
force of their arms / for at that time men vsid not so many sailles as they do
now. notwithstanding they exploited in such^ manner that they came into the hye
see^ where they rowed long tyme^ In which time the queen mirro becam seek unto
the deth^. and fynably when they had been certain space of time. a meruaillous
orage and great wind cast hem here and there / in such wise / that fortune
brought hem to the port of trace^ magre all the maron^ers / for they were al
adutised that it was perilous to ariue there because of the king of that
country which was named Dyomedes

THe king Dyomedes then^e was a tyran^t right inhumayne. And had of long time
ben acustomed to rob all them that arrived in his royaume were hit by see or
by land. he was at that time soiournyng in his cite named Bysance. The which
was afterward called constantynoble / and incontinent that this ship was
arrived at the port of Bysance Dyomedes did hastily do arm him and brought
with him.xxx. of his tyrants / and in this manner came unto the port where were
arrived the / ij / ships of athenes. and as soon as he might be herd of the
maronners he escried them and said / vylayns meschants and unhappy come up on
hye and come out of my ships / for ye must logge in my prisons. or ye shall
have as many strokes as ye may suffer

When the vaillyau^t knight Jason ^^d understand the great felo^nye of the
tyrant and that he saw that all the maronners tremblid for dread in such
wyse^ that they durst not sown a word. he enhau^ced his heed and answ^rde to
Dyomedes sayng^ Gloton miserable what demandest thou / be we not infortunat
ynowh^ as thou semest late us in peace. Dyomedes he ring this answer was as
angry as he might be. wherefore he commanded his accomplices that incontinent they
should avenge him of the Injury that Jason had said to him in his presence /
than the accomplices which were right aspre and more ready to do evil than
otherwise / escryed Jason to the death and descended from thens that they were
til they came to his ship upon the sand / and when the preu Jason saw the
manner of these tyrants / he recomforted him self the best wise he might and
his maronners which were so dysconforted / that they had no power to put hem
to deffence. he took his shield and held fast his good sword / and bad them
to take their bastons and armures. and that they should deffende hem
vaylliau^tly and of good corage^ But in this sayng the glotons approached Jason
and smote upon him with their swerdes right fiersly / certes they enuayhed him
on all sides by great felony But they could not well areche him for as much
as there was between hem about a.vij. foot of watre / wherefore some of them
went for to fe^che a brigge of tree right strong and propice and wherein were
nails of yron^. on both sides / and they did somoche as they fastened this
brigge unto the ship of Jason / And then^e they that were well asseurid / three
of the most vailliau^t of them mounted thereupon and might goo thereon a front
/ But when they supposed to have smiten upon the noble preu Jason. As
vailliau^t and Right asseured knight as he was. he enuertued him self upon
them by such conduyte that with three strokes of his good sword that he gaf
to them he made all three to tumble into the sea / where they drank so much
that they never arose but left there their life

When the maron^ers of the ship saw that their lord Jason defended him so
valiantly. with the trenching of his good swerd they took courage. for they
seasid their staves and armures. And enterprised the battle against their
enemies for to supporte and help a litill Jason / how well they held hem
gladly be hynde as they that fled the strokes to their power^ Certes the
noble Jason kept right valiau^tly the passage of the brigge against the tyrants
and furnysshed hem well upon thentre of the planke^ upon which they went up ^ne
after an other of whom many were hurt and slayn^ There was the tyran^t Dyomedes
the which entremedlid him to his power / to conduyte his accomplices and there
brayed as a lion for somoche as his men might not mate ne beat doun^ the
vailliau^ce of the knight Jason The which allone resisted their fierste and
puyssaunce Notwith^standing for all his great pride he ne daygned not to make
any assault but by the brigge What shall I say you. Certes the bataylle dured
right long between Jason and the Traciens / in so much that the Queen Myr^o
herd tidinges thereof / And was told to her that there was a kmght in the ship
of there company that made so many hye vayllyau^ces upon the tyrants of Trace.
that there was never none seen like to him in prowess

When the Queen Myrro understood these tydinges she thought incontine^t that
hit was Jason that fought so vaillyau^tly for to deffende the.ij. ships. she
had gladly auaunced her self for to have seen his great vasselage / but she was
so right feeble that in no wise she might lift up her heed / and in like wise
was her damoyselle / And so long dured the terryble bataill the ylle party of
the traciens / and of Jason / that the Traciens found no more a live but.xij.
of.xxx. that were comen the dir / And of these / xij seeing the deth^ of their
felaws / there was none so hardy that durst present him to fore Jason ne cople
with him. Than the king Diomedes seeing this that said is^ was so angry that he
might no more be / Than wening to do vaillyau^ce and for to give courage to his
accomplices he went up on the planke and presented him self so far that Jason
salued him / and welcom^eth him with such a stroke of his sword upon the
highest of his helm / that he smote him down reuersid upon the brigge and syn
lift up his arm with the sword / but the paillards tyrants as weary and
Recreau^t fled all trembling and were fore abasshid when they saw their king
Dyomedes so suddenly smeton down / than som^e of his accomplices drew him by the
legs down from the brigge in so much that they took from him his horn that
was about his neck / And blewe and sowned hit loud for to make assemble
there the Cythezeins of the cite / the which h^ring the soun of the horn
assembled them for to come to the rescousse of their lord / but the tempest of
the sea cessed than and the maronners casted the brigge into the watre And than
when they were disan^^ed they departed with their ships out fro the p^rte
with all diligence. And began right Ioyously to row thanking their gods and
the hye vailliau^ces of the no^le knight Iasen that they were so escaped of the
dang^rous parillys of the felon tyrau^t. the which on that other side had so
great despyte and sorrow / that he seemed better a man out of his wit than
otherwise / for he had not fou^den to fore the knights that had so much
prowess and vailliau^ce as he had fou^den tho in Jason

THe two shippis than departed from Trace as said is and were four days long
upon the sea / And on the fyfthe day they arrived at Athenes where Jason went a
lande^ and so did the fair Myrro / the which began to wax hole of her
maladye. At which descente a land mirro espied where Jason took his logging.
and she followed acompanied of her damoiselle unto the time that she saw the
logging. which was the hows of an notable burgeys And than was she in great
thoughts and variacions for to known whether she would logge in the same
logging or not Thus in varieng in this doubt she approached the l^ggyse And syn
returned again and after came again / and fynably. when she saw that Jason was
not in the way she went in / and required of the bourgoys that for her money
she might have a chamber in that house / Then^e the bourgois seeing that the
lady was much well adressid of gracious manner of speking and otherwise. he
logged her and her damoyselle to her plaisir / And did do put the two
palfrayes in a stable by Ias^^^ ^ors which anon began to neyhe as soon as he
smellid them / for he knew them for asmoche as they had been long to gyder in
oliferne / And so made they great chere each to other. whereof the bourgoys had
great marvel But thought nothing but well and gaf hem heye and otes / And
after came to serve Iason^ And found that his chamber was full of marchan^s and
maronners that were comen with him on the sea / which p^sented him wine and
mete^ and gaf him great yeftes of rich Jewels and other strange things

IN this chamber was with Jason a man of six score year honest of his person
and always strong and habyle. the which seeing this presentacion made to Jason
came unto the host and demanded him. who was this young knight to whom men did
so much honor / but the bourgoys could not answer. in so much the bourgoys
and thauncient man axid one of the maronners of this matere. And the maronner
said / that he was / the best. the most virtuous and the most vailliau^t
knight of the world / And that they gaf to him these presents / for as much
as by his hye prowess he had preserved them from the tyranny and danger of
the king Dyomedes and of his accomplices. And so much said the maron^er of Jason
That they Iugged him with his mayntene and semblau^ce to be a much noble
knight and vailliau^t. Among these devises the merchants and maronners took
their leave of preu Jason and offered them to his com^andement and after returned
unto their howses. and anon after that they were goon. the bourgeys did do
couere the table which was couerid of the yeftes. and Jason would that the
knight should sit first because of his aage and aunciente / for in that time
men held the ancient and aaged men in much great reverence and honor

But in this present time hit goth all otherwise. the young men presume to go
and sit above old and ancient men^ and mocque and skorne them that been come
to great aage Saying / that they be feeble of their members of their entendement
and of nature^ And there be many children. that don their fader to understand
that they be foolis. wylling to have in governance the pour old men^ not
pour but rich. For hit is great Richesse to a man when that honorably may
amasse and bring his days unto the degree of old aage^ And yet ben there
children that don worse. for they desire and wisshe their faders and moders
ded. and serve hem with things contrary to their helth^ and lyf^ the which
is the grettest tresour that a man may have as to worldly goodes^ Ha a how
many ben there of them in these days I see al most non other. for the young
people may not here the doctrine of the old men. and wene that they ben so
wyse^ that men need not to show them any wisdom / and also they ben unkind
and full of ingratitude / in so much that if they knew any thing wherewith
they might dishonor them they would do hit. and they resemble unto the sone
of no^ which by d^ri^ion showed the secret members of his fader Alas what
cursed and blind yongthe was that

HOr to come again unto our matter the noble Jason set him down at the table
by the ancient knight. and after that the hooste and hostess which often
time exorted Jason to make good chere / but Jason might nether ete ne drinke^
for certes he did nothing but think and spack not one word but if he were
demanded or araison^ed. After soper when the table was voided Jason and
thau^cient knight werd leyde in one chamber where were two beds / and when
Jason was leyde. he began to sighe in such wise and of so inward sorrow of his
heart that it seemed that the foul should depart from the body^ wherefore
thau^cient knight that was loggid in that other bed by. might not sleep / and
thought right well in him self that Jason was not at his case / and when he
had long herkened his sighs and herd that they encresid always more and more.
he might no longer tarry but he must speak. and said in this manere^ Sir
knight I have great marvel of you / wherefore said Jason / for asmoch^ said
thau^cient knight / that your sighs and bewailinges judge to me that ye ar in
the bed of deth^ / how well by all that I see and conprise in you / hit seems
not by the sight of the eye that ye be seek. for your color is fressh as roose
in may. is it not then^e great marvel for to here you so sighe / yes
certain. Ha a sir knight ansuerde then^e Jason / if ye Judge the disposico^n of
my body after the color of my face ye be greatly abused. for I have a seknes
and maladye right secret which shall first slay me. er my face may be stained
or discolored I am al certain. Sir said thau^cient knight. ye hold a great
ram^e of despair. it is constraynt said Jason

CErtes sir knight answered the old knight. If ye will live what some ever
sekenes ye have or malad^e Put you in my hands and cure. and I make me strong
for to hele and make you hole. I trow sir knight ansuerde Jason that hit is
not in your cunnyng and power that to do. ner in all the subtilte of all the
men mortal. Than answered the ancient knight. be ye seek of the maladye of
love whereof no man may remedy but your lady. Ha / a sir knight answerde Jason
than. who has told yow^ me thinks that ye oppress me so sore that I must
confess to you my caas. And so I declare to you / that I am somoche smeten
with the pestilence of love that I may not live ne endure ne ete ne drink ne
rest night ne day. In good faith^ answerde thauncient knight. ye dar not be
aferd of death syn that ye have non other infirmite. For the maladye that
procedeth^ of love is so graciouse / that hit put^eth noman to death / Certes
the sekenes is of great ensoigne and pain But hit is a maladye whereof men
recouere. Sir said than Jason. If I dye not of bodily death / I shall dye of
sprituel deth^. for hit is in no wise possible that never in this world I
shall have plaisir or solace / And than shall I not be de^e Alas I must needs.
ye treuly of the most anguisshyst deth^ that any man may endure. Sire ansuerd
thauncient knight ye tell me right great meruailes. I tell you trouth^ saith^
Jason / For I am so infortunat in love and so much unhappy and have in my self
so litil of valeur / that I am ashamed and hountouse to live. And would that I
were there / where I shall be.v. honderd year h^re after with out any respyte

When thau^cient knight understood that Jason (...) in somoche and bitter
despair / he had pite of him and said to him for a litil to reconforte him.
Certes gentil knight / I know well my self and understand of this marchandyse
whereof ye wene to entremete. and I apperceyue all plainly that of your love ye
have not enjoyed your first desire and will But I would fayn know if any man
has done you wrong of your lady^ or ellis if this maladye comes and proceeds
by the rigor of her / Certes gentil knight ansuerde Iason^ all my myschief
proceeds of the great rigor of my lady and by the valor and simplenes of me
/ for I have seruid that far lady in a much dangerous war that her mortal
enemies made to her not long syn in the most diligent wise that I coud o^might
/ and after when she was at her above of her adusaires I have required her of
her grace that she would be my lady in love / but she has not willed to see in
me somoche virtue ne somoche valor that she would acorde her to my request And
thus I have therefore my life in great hate and see none other remedy but that I
fall in despayr

HAyr sire ansuerde thau^cient knight have not ye often times herd say. that
one lost and two recouerid. if hit be so that a woman hath^ made of you refuse
/ by your faith shall ye therefore be such a fooll as for to fall in despair /
Considere ye not that there be ynowh^ of other / and if ye have not ynowh^ of
one I shall make you to have a dosayne / there is no great derthe ne scarcete of
women^^ certes if ye remember you well / ye shall say that they cra^che out
men^es eyes / and therefore all this well considerid if your lady set litil by
you Do the same to her and seche another without long taryyng

CErtes sir knight said Iason^ when I have well marked and take heed of your
words / ye speak after your playsir. These ben things that may better be said
than exployted / Certain said the ancient knight I tell to you the secret
and the verray history / I will well that every man be amerous and love. but
that he have.ij. strenges on his bow And that noman put him so ferforth in
love / bu that he may withdraw him in time and in season^ / women one and
other proprely to speak ben malicious in her works. and this proceeds that
each of them adresse other of such conceyll exhort and of favor. Men say /
that the most orguilloust and proudest creature that is / is the devil / and
next after him is the woman. and next after is the fool that is ouquidau^t /
for pride cometh^ not but of folly and tomoche we^ng. Sum women there be that
must have one amerous man to whom they keep hem treuly / Other there be many
that been full of words and lene their eeris to all the world. Other love to
have a eye and tokenes^ and they make like signs also far as they may not
speak to hem. Other they ben that wole ben more prayid and requirid for to
enjoy them and to have their grace / than the gods ben for to have their
fair paradys^ For tabregge and shortly to conclude^ Certes gentle knight^ they
be well happy that have not to do with them in any such rec^ptes. and they be
foles that have to do much with hem / for he that may pass from them. may do
no better than to wit^drawe him fer from hem in fleing the places and all the
circumstau^ces^ Sir answerde than Jason I suppose and think well that ye could
say much better if ye wolde^ first as to the regard for to have / ij /
cords or strenges on his bow That is to understand two ladies / certes it is
not possible that he that so does may be constant in his works ne in his
thoughts. for no man may well serve two maistres. for that one corumpeth^ that
other. Then^e it is so that if a noble man for to auau^ce him self in worship
may do no better then^e for to chese an honorable lady which he may love
treuly secretly and so parfaytly that he fire and dread to do any thing but
that it be honest in all thingis and of Recom^andacion / for all ladies desire
nothing but honor and hye reno^mee / hit is their propre vocacion and their
naturell condico^n^ then^e how shall he have desire of honor that is no true
lover / for he that is double is to much untrue and falls / and if any well or
honor happen to come to him / it is against Reason. right / and good equite.
And if there be any such Certes they be no worthy to live. seen that the ladies
ben of so parfon^de excellence / that the leest of all is worthy to have the
best knight of all the world. And for that cause say no more / that I take two
cords or strenges on my bow. For certainly I had lever to receive and pass
the destrait of deth^

When thau^cient knight had understand thanswer of Jason / he was much
abasshid and said to him / that he would never hold that way ne purpose /
wherf^re fair sire said Iason^. for asmoche said the knight that men should
mocque him. for I suppose well to know that if right now ye should these of two
things one. that is to wete to receive deth^ or ellis chese a new lady / that
ye would more sone the lady then^e the deth^. And for good cause^ Certes there
ben plente of amoreusis that sustain and swear. that for to save thonour of
their ladies they would attend and take the deth^ / But I suppose if they saw
the deth^ come they would no more abide him then^e the quayle abideth^ the
sperhauke / and for a ll thise raisons above said I cou^ceyle you that ye leave
this errors and opynyons and reconforte your self the best wise ye can in your
malady. for by mine advise I believe not that your pain be mortal. and I have
not herd say that eu any man amerous by maladye of love lost his life^ but if
he went out of his mind

Jason with these words could no more Replicque for he apperceyued that he
could not make his matter good ner mayntene it against the old knight / and
thus ending their parliament he slepte unto the time hit was nygh day And
then^e Jason awoke and began to make new sighs in so much that thau^ciennt
knight herd it again. how well that he was a sleep and was suddenly awaked /
And then^e when Jason knew that he was awaked he salewed him and gaf him good
morrow and said to him. Sir knight because of your great age ye have seen much
thing in your time / I demand you by your fayth^ if ye have knowleche in
dremes Wherefore axe ye ansuerde the knight / For asmoche said Jason as I have
not cessed this night to dreme^ By my loyaulte fair sire ansuerde the good old
knighte. if ye have dremed any thing that have need of exposicion or any
interpretaco^n. there is noman is greece that shall better answer thereto then^e
my self / and therefore without any doubt Tell me plainly your dreme / and I
shall expowne to you the substance. Certes sire knight said Jason I had a
marvelous dreme this night^ which in manner of a pass temps I shall declare to
you for as much as ye ar conning in the science of thexposicion thereof. which
dreme or vysion was this. Me thought that I saw two swannes which were right
fair in a medowe / of whom that one was a male and that other a female. The
male came unto the female and made semblau^t for to have acompanyed with her^
the female set naught thereby / but withdrewe her aback. And when the male
saw that / he entrid unto a River that was by and passid over and came lie
with me here in this bedde^ and hit was not long after but me thought that
the female passed the River in like wise^ and came unto the chamber door and
made many pyetous cries after her nature. that the male might not here^ for he
was a sleep. And so had I much great pite for the sorrowful chere that she
made in so much that I awoke. And no more I sawe^ wherefore I wot never what to
thnike

When the ancient knight had well understand a long the dreme of the preu
Jason he said to him in this manner. Sir knight what wole ye say if that
noble lady for whom ye suffer so much sorrow be as much or more Amerous of you
as ye be of her. And by this love she be comen in to this house after you. Ha /
a sir knight answerde Jason. I have no charge of that stroke. for my lady is so
noble and so endowed of so high beauty that she setteth^ naught by any man in
the worlde^ Alleway fair sir said than thau^cient knight / your dreme
signifies by thise / ij / swannes / of whom would make the bataille or
thenterprise that desireth^ conpanye of the female. that ye have willed to be
husbonde to your lady. the which would not here you And nevertheless when she
hath^ known that ye entered on the sea / she entered after in semblable wise and
is comen after you into this propre house where by adventure she is in much
great pain for the love of you / In this faco^n may I prenostique and dyuyne
this werk after the nature of your dreme

Jason with these words began to sighe right ardan^tly and said. What is
this and ^ro whens cometh^ to me this fantasye that may more grieve me then^e
help / I know well that it is a great abuse to me for to think and have a
renouelement of pain and of sorrow. O what pain is to a true louar infortunat
for to be in contynuel martire Ha a my dear lady why have ye not the eyes so
clear for to behold with in my heart and know in what matirdom I am. in what
sorrow and in what anguisshe / Certes madame your eyes basilique have hurt me
unto the death / O what distress / O what guerdon^ for good seruice^ I find me
in the hands of right hard death. but yet f^r to pass the sonner my sorrow. I
shall pray the gods that I may be eurews after my great unhappiness. Then^e
the sage and ancient knight^ Mopsius hering the noble preu Jason thus
sorowfully complain him self and lamenting / in favor of noblesse was greatly
en^oyed in courage. and for somoch^ he said to him in this manner. For gods
sake sir knight leave and goo out of this fantasye. for to much to muse in
Infortune is nothing profitable / A man^ with great travail and labor
bringeth^ his days to an end hauig his life trauersid in many contrary
things / There is no man so ewrous and happy that hath^ all way his will
Certes the time must be taken as hit comes / is hit hard or soft. The heart
of a man should not abasshe in no thing Me seems we have spoke ynowh of love.
I pray you that from hens forth we may enter into an other purpose / And that
ye would tell to me your name and the place of your burth. and the name of
your hows and dwelling place V^ritably sir knight ansuerde Jason than / If there
be any man that may redress and give confort to a desolat^^^ ^t and
disconforted ye be he most propice above all other / I have fou^den so much
goodness in you / that if ye wole tell me your name with out any fault / I shall
tell you mine also^ Fair sir ansuerde thau^cient knight / your desire is to me
agreeable / in such wise that I shall recompte to you my life and all mine astate^
more than to any man that I heue seen this / vi / score year / know ye than
that my name is mopsius^ the god Appollo was my fader / I am king of Si^ce I
have conquered the country of Pamphile I have had / ij / sones^ And when they
were come to man's age / I have made them possessours of my lands. and syn I
am departed in such estate as ye me now see / I have been in the world vj /
score year / during which time I have seen and have learned plente of good and
strange works / prayng you and require that ye show to no person mine estate
ne conditions by no faco^n of the world and when so is that ye speak to me /
that ye name ne call me none other name but mopsius openly ne covertly and for
diuce cause / Mopsius ansuerde than the noble Jason syn it so pleseth you to be
named and called^ I promise you upon my honor that in somoch as touches that
ye have said / hit shall be holden secret in mine heart also fast and such
manner as ye had closed it in the most hard roche of the world / and to the
regard to say to you how I am named. know ye for certain that I am callid
Jason and am borne of the prouynce of thessaile sone of the gentil king Eson of
mirmidone that yet lives as I suppose^ but he is much au^cien^^ With these
words mops^us for to make Jason for to forgete his melancolies / he began to
demand him of the nature of the royaume of Mirmidone and of the countries
about And after demanded him of the birthe of his aage and of his auentures /
and after this he enquired of him many other things unto the time that they
began to Rise and make hem ready. but what thing that Jason said or herkenyd /
he had always his thought on his lady and sigh^d oftetymes out of mesure

When the two noble knights were risen and clad in point / Iason^ went strayt
into the stable to his horse / whom he louyd well. but incontinent when he had been there a litil and that he had parceyuid the two palfroyes of the lady and
of the damoiselle / him seemed that he had seen them tofore time. Then^e he
called the servant of the stable and demanded of him to whom tho two horses
belonged / Then^e the servant ansuerde that they apperteyned to two
damoiselles that were loggid there with mne Truly friend said Jason what
damoiselles that ever they be The two horses belong to my lady best beloved /
and when the good ancient knighte understood Jason. he said to him / Jason
Remember ye of your dreme I take hit on my life that your lady is in this house
/ or ellis the damoiselles ben here for her. the which shall say to you good
tydinges Without any other question or answer Jason departed incontinent from
the stable. and went unto the hostess. and when he had boden to her good
morrow he said to her / Fair hostesse^ know ye the two Damoyselles that been
logged herein^ Certes sir knight ansuerde the hostess / I know hem none
otherwise but as me semeth^ that they ben gentil women and comen of a good hows
/ Is hit possible that I may see hem said Jason. I wot never said thostesse
but I first demand them Fair hostess said than Jason I require you that I
may see them / And that ye will go say that here is a knight their servant /
that has great desire to speak with them

THe good hostess for to do plaisir unto Jason / went unto the two
Damoyselles and said to them* My fair maystresses I come to you in the name and
at the request of a gentil knight he saying your servant / the which
requireth^ you / that of your grace hit would plese you that he might speak
with you. And advise you what hit shall plese you that I answer to him^ But
incontine^t that the Queen Myrro had herd her hostess speak of the request of
the knight^ Certes the color began to change meruaillously and her thought /
that all her body was esprysed wyth^ fyre^ But this notwithstanding she held
her contenaunce the best wise she might. And how well that she doubted of the
coming of the pre^ Jason. and that she was than in a tr^unce what she should
say to her. yet she answered and said. Fair dame. who is that knight that hath^
sen^e you hither / Certes said the hostess I saw (...) never to fore that I
wot of* But to my seming he is the most gentil and the most well made of body
and also most curtois that any man may or can find or speak of. Dame said
then^e the fair Myrro / syn that he is so virtuous and so well accomplisshed as
ye say / do him to come hither / With these words the good hostess did do
Jason come unto the chamber / And then^e as soon as he came in. he beheld the
noble queen which was right shamefaste / and having the heart shytte and
rauisshid made unto her the Reverence and salewed her / And the fair Myrro
welcomed and salewed him again much curtoisly^ This don they entrid into
devises / And then^e after certain words Jason said to the queen in this manner

CErtes my dear lady I had not known that ye had been in this hostelerye ne had been your two palfroies Which I have this morenyng fou^den in the stable by my
hors^ and yet when I had seen and known them I had not supposed that ye had been in this hows. how well when I understood that the two palfroyes belonged to
two Damoiselles / wenyng that here had been two of your damoiselles. I am comen
for to here tydinges of you / Certes sire knight I doubt not the contrary /
and in like wise I had not supposed ner thought to have fou^den you now here.
and I declare to you that I am departed secretly for to goo a pilgremage where
I have promised long syn accompanied only wyth^ this Damoyselle / And I auowed
so to do in the most strength of my war / And I have great meruaylle for
to see you now here. For without doubt I had supposed that ye had been this
our in Oliferne at your rest

MAdame ansuerde Jason I have none hope that ever ye shall see me more in
Oliferne. Certes Jason fair sire ye ben hasty and much swift in your works. I
have good will and great desire for to reward and content you of the good and
agreeable s^ruices. that ye to fore this time have don to me during my war in
persecuting and delivering of my mortell enemies. and if ye return not to
Oliferne. I may not ner can not do reward and content yow^ Ha a my dear lady
an^uerde than Jason / As I said you that other day in your palais / I have not
s^ru^d you in such wise as I have could best do / for menoye or other m^uable
goods. but I have employed my self only for to get your love and your good
grace^ I have paternall richesses largely. and therefore I say to you so much.
that if so be that ye grant not me your l^ue / ye may not content me. And
know ye certainly that after this day ye shall never see me. for as your
true lover and humble servant vnguerdonned / I shall goo withdraw me into some
des^rte bewailing and weping that part after you / And unto my death I wole do
non otherwise. wherefore I you supply with all my heart / that pity may enter
into your noble correge in such wise that on me your pour suppliau^t / ye
have pity and mercy. and ellis of me ye shall never see good

When the noble lady had understand that said is She ansuerde to the preu Jason
in this manner / Certes sir knight there is no heart of lady so hard / but by
the virtue of your requests must needs be softed and molefied / ye have
seruid me hyely and well in all troth and loyaulte In all williau^ce and
diligence. I confess and knowleche hit / ye require me as I understand that I
should be your wyff and felaw / a more gretter thing ye may not demand me / ne
that more me toucheth^ Nevertheless when I apperceyue your great and good
valoir^ to the end that ye have no cause for to fall in despair / I am content
for to accord my self unto your prayers and requests. forseen always that ye
shall goo into your country / And there ye shall assemble your most next
parents and frendes^ which ye shall bring into my cite that in their presence
ye shall wedde and spowse me solempnly

THe noble and vaillyau^t knight Jason thanked the fair Myrro of this good
answere^ And promised to her to do and accomplisshe treuly all that she had
desired^ that is to wete that he should go into Myrmidone for tassemble h^s
friends and alyes. and that he should return into Oliferne for to marye and
wedde her in their presence But when the damoyselle that was comen with the
queen for to hold her company / herd such or semblable promesses made by
her maistresse / which was so well comen to the point of her desir. she was
re^plesshed with consolacion and joy / and forth^with^ she came between the /
ij / lovers and said to them / that she called all the gods to witness and
thanked them for this aliau^ce. Certes than said the fair Myrro / syn that ye
have don so much. I would well that we had leyzer and place for to make good
chere to geder / but as me semeth^ hit may not now goodly he don. for in no
wise I would not ben beknowen^ but hit behoueth^ for mine honor and worship /
that Jason depart from hens incontinent with out ^^^ger tarieng. to the end
that none speak of us but al well And we shall go secretly to the poort for to
get us som^e good maronner / which shall bring us unto our secret pilgremage

Jason the noble prince hering the fair Myrro so ordeyne and conclude of their
sodayn departing began to make simple chere. for he was sore abasshid and
sorouful in such^ wise to leave his lady whom he saw endowed with so hye
virtues. Certes he had entenco^n to have told to the queen a part of his
sorrow and bewailinges that he had made for her sake / but she would in no wise
here him / but smyling she took her leave in somoch^ that Jason enbraced and
kissed her ones or twyes / finably he deperted from thens promittyng her that
in short time he should return unto her again. and as soon as he was deperted
and gon^ his way the fair Myrro and the damoiselle did do sadle their horses.
and rode to the port where they took their shippyng and went to the sea For
tabregge our history without any adventure that ought to be remembrid their
maron^er exploited in such wise with help of the good wind that he had /
that in short time he deliuerid the queen Myrro and her damoiselle in oliferne
/ where they tarried after Jason right long and in right great anoye and
displaisir as it shall be said along and declared here after. But now I shall
rest to speak of the fair myrro and of her faites for this present time. and
shall recompte of the conduyte of Jason. which deperted fro the p^sence of his
lady as said is and returned with all diligence unto mops^us the good old
knight right ioy^us and said to him what was happend of his dreme euy thing /
and that he had herd of his lady good tydinges / how well he declared not to
him that he had spoken to her in her propre person But he made him to
understand that two of her damoyselles had promised to him and sworn that if
he would go into Oliferne accompanied of his kinnesmen and friends / that they
should do somoche anenst his lady that she should espouse and wedde him and that
she should crown him king of her country. And for so much said Jason that I
have taken affiau^ce in the promise of these two damoyselles. I shall goo into
my country for tassemble my friends and kinnesmen in the most goodly and hasty
wise I shall mowe^ and I shall not cesse unto the time I shall come to the above
of my loue^ wherein I have good hoope

How Peleus brother of king Eson of mirmidone and oncle of Jason went unto the
temple of Appollo. and how he had answer that the first man that he met
with an hose on that one foot and none on that other should empesshe him of the
royame of mirmidone which he had supposid to have enjoyed
THus as Jason reherceth^ these tidinges unto the good and ancient knight
mopsius / The sone of the king of that cite named Theseus came unto them there.
which was advertised by the marchantes that Jason had sauid by his
vayllyau^ce. And deliuerid from the furour and tyranny of the perverse king
Dyomedes / And from as far as he had^e espied Jason he knew him. For he had
seen him to fore at the weddyng of Perytheon. And then^e he salewed him and
made him right great chere. the preu Jason rendryd again Ioyously his salewyng
unto Theseus. And when they had each other welcomed theseus brought Jason and
Mopsius for the love of Jason unto the king his fader which was named Egeus.
and when this said Egeus saw Jason / he did him much great honor and
worship for his hye renom^e / And fested him in diuerce maners^ and Jason
desired nothing sauf to return unto his cou^trey^ and thanked him of the
worship that he had done to him and of his right good chere. and syn took
leave. of the king / of Theseus. and of Mopsius / the which knowing that he was
right noble and Right valiyant knight said to him. that they would go with him
and hold him company unto his cou^treye / whereof the noble preu Jason desired
them that they should abide and not goo with him / for he would not goo the
right way^ / But this was for naught. For they said plainly that they would
hold their promise. And Jason wist not what to say / but accorded to them
that they should goo to gyder unto Myrmydone

Jason then^e Theseus and Mopsius departed from Athenes all three. And did so
much by land and by watre without any adventure digne of memory. that they
came unto the cite of Myrmidone where was yet living the noble king Eson. Peleus
came then^e against the noble preu Jason and welcomed him with his body / but
not with his heart / making great sign to be right joyous of his retornyng.
And brought him unto his fader the old king / which was greatly conforted of
the coming of his dear sone Jason / And when the noble preu Jason had made the
reverence unto the king his fader^ the king demanded him of his tydinges. and
where he had been / and what he had done / Jason without taking on him any
vayn glory of any hye and great work that he had done and brought to end.
ansuerde to him by great humilite sayng. Dear sir I come now strait from the
seruise of the noble queen Mirro which is lady of the noble cite of Oliferne.
and the most sage^ the most fayre^ and the most discrete that is in the
remenau^t of all the world. And at such time as I arrived in her court^ she
was in a meruayllous tribulacion by the right puissau^t king of Esklauonie.
which made her war of fire and of blood / for so much as she would in no
wise consent to take him to her husbond. But syn my coming to that part and
that I had charge as he^d and as conduytour of her men^ I entreprised to
sustain the quarele of the noble lady. And in three batailles where I was
accompanied of her people. the gods have given us vyctorie upon the Esklauons
in such manner that the king him self and the most part of his men^ have been slayn^ and smyten in pieces. And among all other there was in the host of
the said king of Esklauonye a meruayllous and puissau^t man. a Geant named
Corfus. the which had put to death many a good knight of Oliferne. with whom
I faughte body against body / not by any strength that was in me. but by
desire to get the worship and honor. and to do that thing that might bring
me in to the grace of that noble lady. whom I put to vttrance by the virtue
of the great beauty of her / And to her apperteyueth^ the right worship and
honor And syn that I have said to you so much. and that hit is Reason that ye
know all / I declare to you that I come now to you in entencion^. that my
kinnes men and friends be assembled for to hold me company to goo and wedd^
her so h^ye and so noble a lady. the which is content to be my wife. forseen
that I should espouse and wed her honorably as it apperteyneth^ to the
daughter of a king. For by thise conditions ben the promesses made and acorded

THe noble and ancient king Eson heering thise tidi^ges had much more Joy at
his heart then^e he had before / And said / Certes my dear sone I am righ^t
joyous of thy well and worship / of thy prouffit and of thyn auau^cement^ I
think well that fortune hath^ ben socourable to the noble lady to whom thou
have ben servant / But wyth^ right great pain may I believe that thou allone
have vaynquysshid the Geant / And if it be so I thank the gods. but late it
pass forth^. and if thou have gotten the grace of her so fair and so noble lady
I have no great marvel there of^ for love in such a caas beholdeth^ no
person / And neu the less to the end that thou know how I desire above all
thing of the world to see multiplicacion in thy seed / I shall array the as to
the sone of a king is lawful and apperteynyng / and I shall send the so well
in point of abillemens of war and of noble men^ accompanied / that by raison
she ought have suffisan^ce / Then^e the preu Jason thanked the king his fader
of this good answer / And at that time they spack no more of the matere / but
intended to feste Mopsius and Theseus / whom they prayed to tarry and accompanye
Jason unto the day of his weddyng. and the two good knights promised that
they should so do / and so they were greatly fested of the king and of his
nobles and also of Peleus which did it again his heart making a fained chere

AMong many devises Mopsius and Theseus recompted of Jason thauenture that he
had in Trace against the tyrau^t king Dyomedes and likened Jason for his
vailliau^ce and habilite unto his felaw Herailes^ which was the most strong
man^ and best assewred that was under the clouds. And because af his high
preysinges and recom^endacions the bruyt of preu Jason augmentid and encresid
from day to day. And hit is not to be vnremembrid that thenuie of the untrue
Peleus grew so terribly that he by no faco^n might ne could have no rest
day ne night / in so much that in the coming again of noble Jason he was
advertised that in the isle of delphos the god Appollo gaf answers of things
that were to come and ^f all destinees^ wherefore he went him self into that
isle and entrid into the temple anoyed meruaillously and pensif / And when he
had made his orisons by great devotion and conseqently his demand for to
know whether ever he should enjoy the Royame of Mirmidone^ The devil which
was in the ydole that herd him / ansuerde to him^ that the royame should be
taken from him by the hand of a man that he should mete hauing-non^ hose ner
sh^oo on that one foot. Peleus hering this hard answer was meruayllously
abasshed^ and departed from thens so passing sorrowful / that he seemed better a
man nourisshed in all his life in sorrow or condemned to cruel deth^ than any
other wise as hit shall be declared here after a long

As then^e Peleus was in his retourning unto Mirmidone always conspiring the
death of the right noble Jason. And ymagyning how he might resist his miserable
and folissh destine. A good old knight met him on the way. This knight
began to behold him in his plain vysage and the salutacion of them both given
and rendered And knowing that he was much pensif and full of Melancolies^ he
devised to him of many things and meruailes of the worlde^ And among all other
devises he said to him / that in an isle standing upon the este see / was a
moch^ rich and noble moton^ or sheep having his flees all of fyn gold / the
which was not possi^le to be conquerd^ And that many valian^t knights had
lost there their life. These devises taken an end / the two knights depart^d
^che from other. And then^e pel^us reentryng into his melancolyes thinkyng
much on the answer that he had received of the god Appollo. and concluded in
him self that if hit happend that he met Jason barfoot on that one foot He
should find the manners if he might to send him in to the isle / whereof the
knight had told him that the rich moton^ or flees of gold was. to the end that
he might be there devoured and never return again What shall I say more.
the perverse and untrue Peleus passid forth^ on his way in such
conspiracions against Jason. And came so far that he fond his neuewe Jason in
a medowe by Myrmidone

CErtes the noble Jason and Theseus were then^e in a medowe with many noble
bachelors of the country passing her time in making plente of dyuce
esbatements and plays in strength^e of body^ as wrastlyng / l^ping / rennyng.
casting the bar or stone or drawing the bow. and when Jason saw his uncle
peleus come / he went to him for to welcome him / And was vnhosed and vnshoed
on his right foot / and made to him the reverence. And then^e Peleus. which
was in doubt of him apperceyued anon his foot bare / how well he said not a
word but showed a right great sign of love unto his neuew Jason / which
thought nothing of the malice and felon courage of his uncle which was
garnisshid of ypocresye^ of traison / and of all evil / And syn passed forth^
sayng to him self that Jason should put him out of the royame but if he fond
some remedy / and that briefly

As ye may understand peleus returned right soroufull and dolan^t and right
desirous for to destroy and do to death his neuew Jason. he frowned in this
wise and bote on his lip a great while / after he bethought him and concluded
in him self that he would do ordeyne and make a Rich dinner. to which he would
do call all the nobles of the royame and of the countries by and adjacent.
Sayng that he would show unto his neuew Jason all that he had herd recompted
of the noble moton^ or sheep of gold. to the end that he should enterprise for
to goo to conquer hit / And when he had made this deliberacion in his courage
/ he sent for to pray and to somone the most part of the nobles of the royame
and the countries by. which came gladly unto this feste and assemblee at the
day to them signefied. Certes this Peleus did do garnisshe this dinner with
al vyandes and noble metes delicious and with beuurages and drinks sumptuous
composed with spices^ But when al was ready the most hye Baron^s were set at
the first tables And among all other nobles there was the noble Hercules^ And
then^e after satte every man after his astate^ and thus after they began on
all parties to make great chiere and spack of many things. and inespeciall of
the hyhe vailliau^ces of the preu and noble Hercules. and of the monstres and
cruel bestes that he had destroyed and put to death by his vailliau^ce and
hardiesse. And thus passed the dinner in such or semblable devises unto the
end that peleus came to fore Iason^ and said to him in the presence of many
kings Barons and knights in this manner

Jason my dear lord and neuewe. ye ar the man of the world that I love best
next after the king Eson my brother your fader. know ye that I have in my heart
great Joy for to have herd the preysinges and Recom^endacions of the
vaillian^t knight Hercules / whom I see here present For the terrible bestes.
for the monstres and for the great and strong Geants. of whom he had
deliuerid the world of. by his vaisselage. But when I behold your great
puissau^ce corporal and that next after hercules ye be one of the most
strengest membrid / best asseurid and one of most vaillyau^test knights that
lyueth^. hit gretely dysplesith^ me in my heart that fortune hath^ not give
place where your puissau^ce and valoir may be showed. and that your bruit and
renom^ee is not so great as I desire. I would hit had cost me the most part of
the goods that the gods have sent me in this world / And that ye were comen
to your above of an enterprise and conqueste that I know in a place / the
which should be much honorable and recom^anded for you and for your lygnage.
Certes fair uncle ansuerde Iason^ I thank you greatly of your good will toward
me. I know right well that often time ye have h^yely cou^ceylled me to mine
honor and worship / And therefore if ye know any adventure or enterprise to be
poursiewed and brought to the end where in I mygh^t employe my time / I
require you that ye will enseigne me thereto. and I promise you that I shall do
asmoche as in me shall be possible to do to come to mine above of honor and
worship to me and of our house

CEertes fair sire Jason ansuerde the disloiall and untrue Peleus I take a
great plaisir to see your good will / which procedeth^ of an noble corage^
and for so much as I know that ye are a knight of hye enterprise / know ye
that in the parties oriental is an isle enclosed round about with the see^ In
the which there is so noble and rich sheep or moton^ of such nature that instead of flese of wolle. he is endowed with a flese all of fyn gold. But he
is kept with certain bestes so cruel and so fires. that there hath^ ben no
man so hardy or so well assewrid unto this present time that durst approach the
noble moton^ or sheep of gold^ if then^e there be in you so much valor and
prowess / that ye might conquer the rich flees or this sheep / me thinketh^
your reno^mee should grow greatly in honor and worship Which is the th^ing
above all other that every noble heart desireth^ / and in trouth^ me ough^t
desire no thing somoch^ / for honor is the principal tresour above all other
and the souerayn recom^endacion that any gentil man may get and ough^t more to
be desired then^e any worldly thing. To this ansuerde Jason. by all our gods
fair uncle I am much beholden to you in many manners. For I know and am
certain verayly. that honor ought to be preferrid and put to fore all worldly
things. and to the end that men may see that the great affeccion and desire to
get worship is so mghe myn^ heart and that the covetous desir of glory and
honor be not me reputed faynedly^ I make here a solemn auowe unto the gods
and promise here in the presence of all the nobles that been here assemblid^
that I shall never cesse to labor to seche the Rich sheep or flese of gold
unto the time that I shall have fou^den hit. and that I shall do the v^terist
of my power for to conquer hit / what some ever danger or parill fall or
happen to me in the conquest

When Peleus had herd this auowe he was much Joyous / and him seemed that
the work went well forth in so much that him thought and supposed by this mean
for to come to the above of his desir. Certes the noble and preu Hercules and
Theseus preysid much Jason of this enterprise And forthwith in fayte they
vowed in like wise that if Jason achieuid not his enterprise that they should
put hem in deuoir for to bring hit to an end / and during this dinner they
spack long and devised much of the manner of the vow of Jason / and above all
other peleus wa^ so glad and joyous that he prolonged and held solemn feste
eyghte days long And adutised the king Eson of the right noble entreprise of
his sone Jason / always eson notwithstanding thenterpris was dangerous and
mortal^ yet was he well content that hi^ sone should achieue his auowe For
tab^egge the matter peleus sent for many werkemen for to make a ship / and among
(...) other there was one named A^gos the which^e ordained to him one so fair
and so subtille a work that neu was seen such. and was callid Argyne because
of Argos

CErtes this Argos was a passing wise man and virtuous / And inespecial he was
the most learned and expert maron^er that was at that time in all greece. And
when this ship was made he adutised peleus and Jason also which was as glad
and joyous as he might be. for all that eu was necessary for him he fond it
ready and the ship arayd and ready for to deperte. Then^e Jason took leave of the
king his fader and of his uncle peleus^ And so did the noble Hercules /
Theseus and Mopsius and other unto the nombre of an honderd knights of greece.
which would accompanye Jason in this wiage^ And this license and congie taken
/ with all diligence they entrid into the ship the hole.C. knights And when
the good patron argos had disancred from the port where the ship had been
made^ which port was named Seserre. he did somoche diligence that he
brought this noble company upon the hye see / where Argos sailed with hem
many days always sailing toward the eest after the sigh^t of the sterres and of
the son / and so long he conduyted hem in this point. that vytailles began to
faylle them / and were constrained by force to go a land at the first port
that they fond / that is to wete at the port of frigye named Thenadon^ which
standeth^ nygh^ unto troy the gran^de / of whom laomedon^ was king / which
used great rudesce unto Jason and to the knights of his company And this evil
fill upon him afterward and upon his subgettes / he was not greatly to be
complained as it shall be declared a long here after in th^i present volume

How the king Laomedon^ of Troy would not suffer Jason ne his company
descend on the londe^ And how the Queen Ysiphyle received them
IN this paas saith^ one history that Argos the good and subtle maronner made
and ordained all things that faylled unto the noble ship where the noble
knight was in under saylle. And the wind blewe there in at their wille^ hit
was about.x. of the clock a fore none^ the fair son shone clear and spredde
his rays upon the land / and the weder was soft and well dysposed / And at
that t^me much people were upon the banks of the sea which beheld from
far the noble ship of the Greeks. which as said is came that time the
saylle dysplayed and set upon an hyhe. And saylled fast in his course upon
the see^ whereof they were so sore ameruaylled / that they wiste not what thing
hit might be^ In so much that sum of them were so sore aferd / that they
fled in to Troy And the other abood at the poorte abydyng thauenture They
that fled to wyth^ in Troy. went unto the puissau^t king Laomedon^^ And
said to him all be wept and drowned in teeris procedyng of great fere and
dread. that they had apperceyuid from far in the sea a great monstre
lifting him self meruayllously swymming and R^nnyng upon the water more
swiftely than an horse coud run on the ground or on the londe^ And affermed
to the king laomedon^ by the^r faith that this monstre without comparison^ was
more to doubt and feere than the monstre that hercules had slain by his hye
vaillyau^c^ Certes in this said country tofore that time Hercules had slain a
monstre also great as a whale. as hit is plainly contained in thistorie of
hercules

When the king Laomedon^ had herd these tydinges reherced / he was all
abasshid / Then^e he made one of his knights to take an horse as swift as the
wynde^ and sent him to thenedon^ for to axe and enquire of the troth What
thing hit might be that the people were so sore aferd of^ And in such wise
exploited the knight that he came to the port of thenadon^ / and there he fond
the preu Jason and his knights of Greece / but first he aspied argos that
ankred his ship right nygh^ to thenedon^^ and went not into the toun^ for
asmoch as it was no need / considering that they were nygh the cite of Troy
which was so great in magnificence that there was none like in the remenan^t of
the world / he enquired first of the habitan^ts and dwellars of the country
if they had seen any such monstre on the sea. Then^e the men^ of the country
ansuerde to the knight / that they had seen no such monstre upon the sea / and
they that had brought such tydinges to Troy were greatly abused if they had
supposed to have seen any monstre / and that there was none other thing but a
ship of Greece saillyng on the sea in the which by their advise were great
nombre of knights of Greece Right well in point of arms and such things as
should be needful and necessary for them to enter into ba^aylle

When the knight of troy had understand all that said is he descended of his
horse and went a foot unto the knights of greece. To whom he demanded what
they sought and had to do in that ^ou^tre. Than Jason answered to the knight^
that great necessite of vytaille for to trauerse into far contrees caused
them for to take their port there and non^ other thing. Incontinent when the
knight had understand these tidinges he returned and took his horse and rood
unto the king his lord. and recou^ted to him all that he had exployted. Than
the king Laomedon thus advertised of the descente of the knights of Greece and
understood that they were descended for to vytaille their ships ymagined
anon^. that they were espyes. which Hercules had sent theder for tespye the
royaume. wherefore he renuoyed and sent again the knight unto the greeks / and
com^au^ded them straytly. that they dispose them with all dyligence for to
depart out of his lande^ and to go ellis where to seek vytailles if they had
need. And if they departed not suddenly and disancred and took some other way.
he should come with his puissau^ce in Arms upon them so mightily that never
after they should have will for tespye Royaume cite castle ne country

THan when Jason and his felawship had herd thexpresse and rude comau^dement of
the trojan king / they were sore displesid and not without cause. for asmoche
as they must needs depart. Than the noble Jason for the better / ansuerd
curtoysly unto the knight. And showed him that they were not comen theder for
to espy the Royaume ne the citees / castel^ ne country of the king Laomedon ne
of none other. when Hercules herd thanswere of Jason which him seemed was to
benygne considering how Laomedon^ had comau^ded them. he might not hold his
pee^ but took the words from Jason and said to the knight in this manner.
know thou knight syn that Laomedon^ as vyllayn of heart and banisshed from
all noblesse hath^ refused to Jason of Mirmidone vytailles for his money.
that there shall descend in short time at the ports of this country men in the
name of Jason and that in so great nombre that all his Royame / his citees /
towns and castles shall be put in such ruin and perplexite that in fyfty
year after shall not be fou^den a stone upon a stone ner no corn shall be eerid
ne sowen^. Fair lords then^e ansuerde the knight ^f Troye^ I am sorry that ye
are not better content with the king my lord / and that he has not received
you other wise in his cou^tre^ And ye know well. that where curtoisie is showed
hit bleueth^ not vnrecompensid. ne Rygour in like wise but if hit be remembrid^
And for as much as I am a messager. I shall gladly make unto king Laomedon^
report of that I have fou^den of you / and with thise worde^ the knight
returned unto Troy

THen^e the preu Jason demanded Argos. and said to him / that they must
disancre and depart fro thens but if they would abide the cruelte and furour
of the king Laomedon^ and of all his power. Then^e the good patron Argos and
his maron^ers disancred the noble ship / and went again to the sea / where
sone after the wind began to rise and tempest horrible and impetuose^ But the
troian^ knight which was messager as soon as he was comen to for his lord and
had made his reverence. the king demanded him what was becomen of the
gloutons of greece that were come and had descended on his land for respye
his Royaume and his citees. The knight ansuerde and said. Sire I have done to
them your message. They ben a great nombre of knights. and resemble well by
their contenan^ce and habyllemens that they ben deperted from noble and good
house. And know for certain that when I had done your message / one of them
that seemed virtuous and discrete ansuerde me that they were not comen theder
but only for vytaille (...) to pass forth^ on their way / and that they were
no robbours ne pirates of the sea / but when the young knight which was fair
and curtois as a maid had finyssh^id his purpose / An other of them / which
had a meruaillous and cruel chiere. and better resembled hercules by his
vysage and contenan^ce then^e any other. said to me in a great anger and fierte
in this manner / know thou knight that syn that laomedon^ thy master as
villayn of heart and banisshid from all noblesse hath^ reffused to Jason of
Myrmydone vitailles for his money That in short time shall descend into his
countries men^ in the name of Jason and in so great nombre / that all his
royame his citees towns and castles shall be put to such ruin and perplexite
that within fyfty year after^ shall not be found one stone upon another^ ner no
corn^ shall be sown and ered upon the ground / And forth^with^ they have
disancred and sone after they had sailled by force of wind and rowyng of oores
so far that I had lost the sight of them

When the king laomedon^ had understand the report that his knight made to
him / he was so angry that he seemed better frantyk or out of his wit then^e
other wise And said well that if he had known tofore what they had been and
their entente / he had hem all have done dye myserably And therwith^ the
messager departed and laomedon^ withdrew him into his chambres sore troubled
and pens^f for the menaces of the knights of grece^ whom he knew not but by
raporte of the knight / which knights being then^e well forth upon the sea /
were sore vexed with great winds blowing on all sides / with thonders^
with raynes and great orages and tempests / which rored so hugely and
terribly that the air was trobled and the weder was so derk. that the son
shone not in four days during that the tempeste seced not. in which time
their vitailles faylled in such wise. that the knights of greece had not to
ete^ and their ship was often times in much great paril / for in the end a
meruaillous turbilloun of wind roose in the sea that blewe away their sail
and all to brake their mast / that the cords and roopes were broken into
pieces. but fortune h^lpe hem in this need / For notwith^standing this great
adventure the ship was conduited unto a port named Lennos where he hurtlyd
ag^in the ground in such a randon^ and force / that hit was all to broken and
rent that they that were with in were in great danger and had been in worse
caas than they were to fore / if they had not set foot a land

THis poort was callid Lennos after the name of a much puyssaunt cite. which
was richely set not far thens^ But Incontinent that the Grekyssh^ knights
had taken land seeing the great danger that they had been inn sprang out
of the ship. which anon was filled full of water. And when they saw hem out
of that mortal parill and had well supposed / for to have been in sauete /
Suddenly came out of Lennos the rich cite moo then^e fyfty thousand women^
armed garnisshed with pennon^s and recognysan^ces which came rengyng^^^ in in
fair ordenan^ce a long by the cooste of the sea / fast by the port / and after
they sent two of their women messagiers for to somene the grekyssh^ knights
for to reentre into the sea with out any long tarieng. But when Jason
understood the somaco^n that the two damoiselles made. he was sore abasshid and
not without cause^ for he apperceyuyd tofore so many hedes armed that he knew
not the nombre^ and syn considerid how they had been in great danger by the
fortun^ of the sea / and that vitailles failled them. and that worse was he
saw his ship all to broken. which was on all sides full of water. This
notwithstanding by cause he ne would discorage ne abasshe his felawship more
then^e they were / he showed well that he had good courage / and said to one
of the two damoiselles in answering to her message

NOble damoisell I have right well understood your som^acion I pray you of
your grace that it may plese you to say to me. into what country fortune hath^
brought us at this time / And for what cause I am by you sommenid for to
reentre unto the sea / Certes sir knight answerde the damoiselle / The country
that ye be arrived in is not right grete^ but it is right fertyle and comodious
/ and hit is named Lennos after the name of this cite here by Which is named
after the same name. And as to the Regard of the rayson and cause. why this
som^acion is made thus to you / I will well that ye know to the end that ye
hold you the better content. That hit happend now late that in this cite of
Lennos was a king named Thoas This king had a great war against the
Argiens / and for to may^^ene this warre^ he ladd with him all the men young
and old. And left this cite without men / whereof the ladies damoyselles and
other of the cite were right evil content. And seeing that they were without
men They assembled them to geder with the daughter of the king which is named
Ysiphyle / And by meure deliberacion^ sent to the king and to their husbondes.
that they should return into their cite / Upon which the king Thoas answered /
that he had besieged his enemies and if his cite should be lost he would not
depart from his ooste unto the end of his war

When the ladies and damoyselles of the cite had herd this answer / they
took hit evil in gree / And yet they sent again unto the king and to their
husbondes that they should come and return home unto their cite. but that was
for naught / for they would nothing do after their desir And when the ladies
saw this / they conspired against the king and their husbondes / and put to
deth^ all the men children that were in the cite / after they determined and
iuged that if their husbondes or faders. parents and friends came again from the
war or other what someuer they were should be slain the first night of their
coming as soon as they should be a sleep / and that neu after they should suffer
noman to enter in to their cite / after this conclusion taken they crowned
ysiphile queen upon them / and afterward when the king was returned from the
war with his people / the ladies and damoiselles of the cite did with their
faders husbondes and parents and other in such^e wise as they had concluded to
fore / in somoch^ that of al them that returned from this war escaped none
from this murdre and pestylence but he was slain and murdrid reseruyd the king
thoas Whom the queen ysiphile would in no wise murdre / but this
notwithstanding she deliuerid him into the hands of the ladies / which put
him in a boot allone. and sent him to the sea in exyling and banisshing him
out of his royame

When this damoisell as messagere had recompted unto the noble Jason this that
said is / That other messager took the word fro her and said / Lords and
knights my felaw has said and told you now the reason and cause where fore ye
may not be received into this cite / and there fore t^ gretter meschief
befalle and come to you^ withdraw you unto the sea / for if ye tarry here long
the ladies will assail you asperly. and shall deliuere to you a meruaillous
battle Jason ansuerde and said. by all my gods fair lady our ship is all to
broken and f^rfrusshid as ye may see and is full of watre. And on that other
side we perisshe for hunger if we be not shortly socourid. for it is two days
past syn we ete any morsel mete / And therefore if it must needs be and no
remedy / we had lever to deye by glayu^s and war then^e by famyne. how well
by your grace ye shall return unto the queen and ladies and recompte to them
our estate and necessite And that we all to geder pray them and require
instantly if there be in hem any virtue or noblesse that they will now show hit
having pite on us. For the fortune of the sea that has trauailled us by many
days in such wise that we supposed to have perisshid from our to our has
brought us hither as ye may see against the will of our maron^ers and of us

With this request the / ij^ damoyselles messagieres returned into their cite
unto their queen ysiphyle and other ladyee to whom they recompted from word to
word the answer that Jason had rendrid and what he required Then^e the queen
having herd the answer of the / ij / messagieres / she axid and enquired what
people these knights of greece were and of what condycion and faco^n and of what
nombre they were / Certes madame ansuerd that one of the / ij / damoyselles. I
saw neu in my days more goodlier men ne better bespoken / and I suppose there
were neu seen so well faring men and great and upright / so well in point of
habillements so well taught and so curtays in all manners / and it is to be
supposed that they ben the choice and pyked out of all the humain people / and
there may well ben of them the nombre of an / C^ all of one faco^n and of lyk
clothing / Then^e the queen hering the messagiere that so hyely recom^ended the
state of these knights of greece / thinking also of their request / began to
have pity of their mysauenture and of their myscases that they have had on
the sea by tempeste / and forthwith she sent for to fecche four of them for
to come and speak with her / whom she would examyne

When the honderd knights understood these tidynges^ they aduysed among hem
all which four of them they might best send unto the queen Ysiphile / And
concluded in one that they would send Jason / hercules / theseus and an other
knight named Castor right fair. which came tofore the Queen and great nombre of
her Damoyselles And they were not long comen but that the Queen and her
Damoyselles were terribly esprised of the love of these four knights. For
there was nether Queen ne damoyselle but desired with all their heart their
company for the synguler and especial beauty of each of them. Certes ysiphile
at thinstan^t that her two noble eyes had beholden the great beauty of Jason.
she was becomen somoche amerous as was possible as of the most fair. the most
gracious and the most couoytable of the four / Then^e she spack to hem and
demanded them in general. what they sought in her royame. and whens they came
and whyther they would goo / and of what country they were. Then^e the noble
Jason thinking of the demandes of the queen considering the great danger where
they were in and the necessite of famyne and hunger that furmou^ted^ he as
captayn and chief of the vyage ansuerde humbly sayng in this manner

MAdame plese hit you to know that we ben the nombre of an honderd knights
all gentill men^ of one company and of one country we ben departed in one
ship But we have had upon the sea so many infortunes by tempeste of winds
and of orages that has holden us so long in great doubt to be perisshid. that
vitailles ben faylled us two days passid / And for to make short we goo to
seche vitailles for to help our necessite^ and syn hit plesith^ you to know
from what country we ben parted and whither we attend to goo^ I declare to you
that we come from Greece / and our entente is to sail so far til we find an
ysle of the sea / where in is a much rich moton^ or sheep bering his flese
all of fyn gold. the which neu knight yet had the power ne hardynes for to
conquer ne approach. neither only for to behold and see / For many
meruaillous and terrible bestes have hit in keeping / Among the which I have
understand there is a right cruel dragon / how well I have auowed and promised
for tauenture my self for to conquer hit er I ever return again into my
cou^treye / or I shall deye in the pourfuyte thereof / as many knights have
done here to fore whereof is pity / Wherefore Right hye and noble lady I Require
you humbly. that ye will have mercy and pity on me and of myn^ unfortunate
felawes deyng for distress of honger and famyne / And that we may have
vitailles for our silver and money. and also grace and leave for to remyse and
make our ship again which is broken and rent in taking land upon your
seygnourie and lordshipe

When the noble Jason had made his remonstraunce unto the queen ysiphile as
said is. she withdrew her a part with her damoiselles^ and demanded of them
what was best to do with thise noble men / They were al of oppynyon / that it
should be a great sin and mesfeet for to late them there deye for famyne and
honger / And at the end they concluded that they should be received into their
Cite notwith^standyng their ordenan^ces and statutes by them to fore made^ in
so much that the Queen Ysiphile returned unto Jason and said to him. that
for the honor of noblesse^ the ladies would receive him and his felaws in lyk
wise. Then^e the noble Jason thanked the Queen of this grace right curtoisly.
and did do send for his felawes that they should come into the cite. the
which incontinent as they knew that they should have vytaylles were passing
joyous and seemed to them proprely that god was descended among them. Then^e
they came to fore the ladies whom they salewed but desired with all their heart
their company for the synguler and especial beauty of each of them. Certes
ysiphile at thinstan^t that her two noble eyes had beholden the great beauty of
Jason. she was becomen somoche amerous as was possible as of the most fair. the

said is. she withdrew her a part with her damoiselles^ and demanded of them
what was best to do with thise noble men / They were al of oppynyon / that it

and did do send for his felawes that they should come into the cite. the
which incontinent as they knew that they should have vytaylles were passing
joyous and seemed to them proprely that god was descended among them. Then^e
they came tofore the ladies whom they salewed right reuerently^ And anon as the
Queen saw this noble company tofore her in all humylite she deliuerid to an
honderd of her ladies the honderd knights of Greece. to each of them one of
their own as for the best as her seemed and she retained Jason for her part. In
somoche the greeks entered into the cite with the ladies and with out other
difficulte. they brought hem into their howses / each departed from other.
where each lady fested her knight with good vyandes and metes after their power
and with good heart. making to them a chiere in such a wise and faco^n that
many of the knights found hem so plainly in the grace of their ladies in
asmoche as they might that they were served with the terms of love / and more
I say not at this time present

INcontinent when the Queen ysiphile saw that she had Jason in her bayllye.
she was somoche joyous as she might be^ she had set all her entente to
behold the great beauty of the noble prince / and above all other she desired
to have his acqueyntau^ce. and in the beholding and aduysing him she made to
him many gracious signs and tokenes of love during many days and often times.
But the noble Jason which had his courage set in other place took none head.
how be it she might no longer dure without she should be ded somoche was she
esprised wyth^ his love / and yet she durst not speak one word^ and when Jason
had soiourned there a certain space and nombre of days / he ordained unto his
patron^ money that his ship might be set in point / and ordained men that
should help him / then^e argos set hand unto the werk by right great
diligence. and did so much that in short term the ship was all ready for to
help hem^ But Incontinent as the Queen Ysiphile was thereof advertised. she
did do break it by night by any of her damoiselles / And she spack with Argos
the good patron and did some oche with him that he assemblid all the
knights of greece / and in their presence said to Jason the ship might not
be made again for to depart thens in viij. months hole / whereof many of the
Greeks were meruaillously Joyous

When hercules which had a much noble courage understood these tydinges / he
said unto Jason. syn that it is so that they should not depart out of that
country / he would go see the country about / and cou^ceylled Jason that he
should abide in the cite for to keep to geder his felawes. and Jason accorded
thereto with good will. Then^e the Right valiant Hercules went forth^ on his
way / all reconforted tabide all auentures^ And hit happend him that he came
unto a place of a king named Furius whom he deliuerid from the arpies and
enchaced them unto the River of sturphale in such wise as it is contained in
the history of the faytes of hercules. Jason which abode in the cite of
l^nnos as said is intended gladly unto the dubbyng and making of his ship /
And Ysiphile on that other side always in her amerouse semblants and Regardes /
Mopsius was the most part of the time with Jason and devised often times of the
great beauty of the noble queen mirro / And as he was one a day set at dinner
with Jason and ysiphile / he parceyued of the graciouse atrayans regardes that
she gaf often times unto the preu Jason and apperceyued right well that she had
set and given to him all her love. And thus passed he the mele with out
any word or semblau^t making. But after the dinner he callid Jason / And said to
him / that he would goo walk with him unto his ship and so departed out of
the halle they two allone. And then^e when they were in the field Mopsius said
to Iason^ Certes sire I would fayn axe you a demand if it were your playsir.
Fair sir said then^e Jason late not for any thing but declare your courage and
desir / then^e Mopsius demanded him / if he were any thing amerous of the Queen
Ysiphile. Jason swear to Mopsius that he was not amerous of her. Certes sir
said Mopsius. I am all certain that Ysiphile is terribly amerous of you. And
therefore I advertise you to the end that ye find the menes for to speak to her
a part. for if ye may atteyne thereto. yt should be to you a right fair pass
temps for a space. and we all should fare the better

BY all my gods answered then^e the preu Jason. er I would use any disloyalte
against my lady the fair Mirro. I had lever be condemned to bring to end
and adchieue as many perilous auentures / as ever the worthy hercules achieued
er ever I should return again to Greece The nobles of this time present ben
not so disposed to ensiewe the terms of the right renomed prince Jason as it
is tofore declared^ and therefore I conceyll not the ladies that they give no
more affiau^ce than ynowh^ doubting that by some wey they be not abused / Thus
as the / ij / gentil knights spack of the fair mirro and of ysiphile / they
came where as argos the master patron solicited the werk and making of the
ship and so passed the time a litill in spekyng of dyuerce pourposes / And
after that they returned unto their logys. and the noble Queen Ysiphyle was
enamoured in such wise on the noble preu Jason. that she thought on none other
things but for to plese him unto her power And he never departed from thens but
that she held him compaignye. or ellis she was always at a wyndowe f^r to look
whither he went

When then^e she apperceyuyd that Jason returned unto his loggyng at this time.
She went against him and took him by the hand and lad him into one of her
chambres^ where she showed to him great party of her richesses and tresours /
And after she said to him in this manner Right noble and valiant knight all
thise richesses ben all only at your com^andement / and also my body with
all. whereof I make now to you the ghifte and present / And furthermore I have
nothing of valeur / but that ye shall have at your abandon^ and will to the end
that I may deserve honorably your grace. Then^e when the preu Jason had
understand this that said is. he ansuerde to the lady sayng My dear lady I
thank you right humbly of your curtoysye / And I declare unto you that in no
faco^n I have deseruyd the hye honor that ye present to me. Ha. ha gentill
knight said then^e the lady. hit is well in your power for to deserve all if
it be your plaisir. In good troth madame ansuerde then^e Jason if there be any
service or plaisire that I may do unto you / com^ande ye it and I shall
accomplisshe hit freely and with good herte^ How fair sire said she then^e.
will ye accomplissh^ my conmandement. Certes madame said he I shall not fail in
no point if hit be to me possible And there fore declare ye to me your good
playsyr and desire. And after that ye shall parceyue how I shall enploye my
self thereto

THe Queen Ysiphyle hering the courtoys answer that Jason answered / was so
much Joyous and glad that she might ner could be more^ And said to him
Certes fair sire your courtoys and humble words have put me in such danger.
that in no wise I may no longer hyde from you a requ^ste^ that weyeth^ more
heuier on my ^^rte. than a mylne stone should upon my heed. And t^^t long a fore
this time ye should have known / ne had been dame Esperau^ce. which had
nourissh d and entert^^n^d to hide my faith and courage. which at this our I
shall show unto your noble persone^ And know ye for troth that I have
perceived that ye be of a much noble and ancient hows. above this that ye
excede and pass / all men in beauty and in vailliau^ce. If your semblau^t lie
not. And then^e that I have put in my souenau^ce all thise things / I have had
right great desir for to have your love and aliau^ce^ For which things hit is
necessary that I pray you that hit shall plese you to be my husbonde^ and I
shall be your wife and espowse / And thus ye shall be king and lord of this my
royame. My right dear lady ansuerd then^e the noble Jason. ye have don to me a
playsir so great in giving to me your gods largely in eting and drinking / and
in like wise to my company and felawes^ that I may never deserve it as well for
such good as for the love of the ladies to whom I wole obey with all my might
and power in all their conmandeme^ts And know ye noble pryncesse. that there is
no service ne plaisir but that I am content to do for you / sauf only this
request. for I may not well goodly acorde hit unto you my worship saved and
kept. for as much as late I have promised unto a noble lady and of a good
place for to take her by marriage. wherefore I require you that ye will hold me
for excused / Ha / a Jason my dear friend for one promise ne more ne less
what will ye make. Men say communely / That far is from the eye. Is far
from the heart

When the noble Jason saw that the lady oppressid him in such manere^ that
with great pain he wist not how to answer / notwith^standing he said to her
/ Certes my dear lady. I knowleche that the heart of a noble man ought to
desire nothing so much as honor with out reproach. Troth hit is that I am
bounden by promise. the which if I acquyte not. I am at all days dishonored
I had lever be deed or condemned to perpetuell exill^ and think not Madame
that I reffuse your alyan^ce for any desdayne / for in good faith^ I should
hold me right ewrous and well fortunat / if I had to wife one so fair a Lady So
noble and so rich as ye ar. Noble knight answered then^e the lady / ye know
right well. how ye and all your company had been deed for honger and of
distress if I had not recuyellid you in this Cite and fed you / And for
somoch^ I pray you yet ones that ye accord my request / and with out any
reproach me thinketh^ by many raysons that ye ar bounden greatly so to do / I
am driven for to require you in this faco^n / and I ymagyne that the Gods
have sent you unto this cite for two causes principally. The first is ^o
the end that ye should be socoured in this cite / ye and all your company in
tharticle of the Ieopardie of your death where ye were in. And the second.
that ye should inhabit this cite to the end that hit should not be diserte^ For
this cite is enhabited with women^ without king and have non^ other pastor
but me which am their chief^ And for so much I somene and pray you that ye
socoure this cite as she hath^ socoured you. And that ye entende to repeuple
all of your seed / And in verray trouth^ ye so doing shall accomplisshe a
v^rtuous work and of gretter merit than to maintene a simple promise made
unto a lady or damoyselle / how well often times they ben made lightly and with
right litil occasion they ben enfrainte and broken^

MAdame ansuerde then^e Jason / I confess right well that ye and the ladies of
your cite have socoured in our right great necessite / me and my felawship
with vytayll And in recompensing whereof there is no thing to us possible but
that all we will enploye us thereto is hit in rep^upling this cite or other
wise. but to the regard of my self I may not conduite my self thereto. But if
I should do directly against mine oath / ye ought to know / that myn^ honor
gooth^ and toucheth^ ner myn^ heart than any other thing. And for so much
know ye that under the couerture of this gracious courtosie I have not
^nt^cion^ to commise one so great an evil. which should be to me and to mine
thing over much reprochable^ Incontinent as ysiphile understood this answer
of Jason. and that she apperceyuid that he was ferme in his purpose / for to
abide true unto his lady^ she spack no more to him of this matter but took leave
of him and departed. and Jason in like wise withdrewe him into his chamber. And
Ysiphyle abode in her chamber sore esprised with love. and on that other side
she was so angry that she might not convert Jason. that ^on^ can tell ne
write. But when the parfonde derkenes of the night was come / she leyde her
down in her bed gretely esprised of anger and right pensive. for in her
stomach was a great bataylle between her heart and shame / her courage was than
admonested that she should goo and lie with Iason^ but shame said nay and
withstode it / wherefore the battle was great and dured long. but in the end
therte vaynquisshid all^ For shame was put aback in such wise that the fair
ys^phyle aroos from her bed and went and leyde her down by Jason which than
slepte / And when she was abedde she began to tremble for asmoche as shame
followed her. and so trembling she enbrased Jason and awoke him sayng in this
manner. My verray friend and love Jason your continence and the constance of
love have com^anded me to come to you / how well hit is to me a much great
shame and vylonye. but sithe that ye have not willed to be my husbonde and
spouse / at the least ye shall be my love and friend. and take ye no desdayne
of the love of a pour folissh^ gentil woman

When the noble knight Jason herd the fair Ysiphyle speak and felt her by him
all naked^ he was sore abasshid / Certes her flessh^ was right tender and sweet
/ always she approached to him and he to her. for he was a man / and then^e when
he was awaked he said to her^ In good trouth^ madame I am right sorrowful and
angry that I may not be your husbonde. ye show well how that above all other
yt have me in your grace. A ha and that I now were free and without promise
upon my faith I should be your husbonde and obey you unto my power. And with
thise words they enbraced each other and kysshed to gyder^ And more know I
not but that they mayntened this life the space of four months or more in
such wise that Ysiphile was with child and wax^ great of a right fair sone.
of whom she was deliuerid by space of time / And during these four monethis
the ladies of Len^os lay with the knights of Greece / And many of them were
conceived with there seed / And in this wise was the Cite rep^^^plid of young
childeren masles What shall I make you long proce^ The days that have no rest
pass lightly. Maistre argos rendrid his ship all repaired and made. And
Hercules came again into Lennos / Jason also would depart toward his Iourneye^
and assemblid one a day his felawship and said to them / My good brethren
and friends ye know well how we have been here and soiourned a much long space
of time / And yet we have no more knowleche ne have herd speak of the moton^ of
gold or golden vu^ese no more then^e we herd tofore we departed from our
country. I will that ye know that I live here in great sorrow and in terrible
great anoyan^ce / for I can not take solace ne plaisir in any thing that I see
/ for asmoche as I am pricked by contynuel exhortacions procedyng of diuce
causes and procuring the expedicion entretienyng the end of my laboureuse
voyage to the which bring us the gods in short time to our helth^ honor and
glory / wherefore I pray you all that every man^ make him ready for to remeue
and depart. for I have entencion for to depart at the end of four days
without longer abydyng

HErcules / Theseus and Mopsius and all the other knights had great Joy when
they herd the good disposicion of Jason / and they answerde him / that they
should be as sone ready as he / and then^e one and other began to pourueye for
them vitaylles and of all such things as were necessary for them / The queen
and the other ladies knew anon of the departement of Jason / wherefore they
were much displaysau^t and right desolate / and sore anoyed them to see the
grekysh knights make their preparacions for to depart / and that one
conplayned to that other sayng / Certes these knights of greece abandon^e us
and give us over / we shall n^u have Joy ne solaas^ The queen ys^phyle among
the other was most anguysshous of this departing / and came to Jason and said
to him / Alas / alas lord Jason / have ^e well the courage for to withdraw you
from me and to give me over tofore ye have seen the fruit of your noble person
/ which is nourisshid in my blood / Ha a my soulace the plaisir of mine eyes /
may hit not be that the right amerouse prayer of the mother that shall (...) of
your child may hold you here yet three monethis / hit is a litil time of / iij
/ months / they shall be anon^ exspired and paste. Alas Jason / alas my confort
prolonge ye and tarry your departement at my request / for I am she that so
much loves you that I may no more / Alas behold with pite my womb / the
chamber and mansion^ of your blood / and in no wise I require you to depart so
hastily

IN good fayth^ noble lady answerde then^e Jason if I might abide with you
lawfully^ I assure you that I would so with good heart. but I have auowed and
promised for to adventure my self in the conqueste of the noble moton^ or flees
of gold. I know not how long I shall live ner how long hit shall be er I come
there / hit is force and great necessite for my singular were and perdurable
honor that I employe my time entierly whilis I may and that I acquit me
diligently to thacomplissheme^t of my said auowe

With this answer the queen ysiphile had in her heart such anoye. that she
began to weep and right perfou^dly to sighe. and after she began to say softly
/ Alas / alas how may mine eyes see the departing of mine euydent Joy. Alas I
was born^ in an evil constellaco^n when I may not find a litil of good
fortune in this world. all^ consolations withdraw them from me / all honor
flees from me / al bou^tees forsake me. and contrary all sorrow ren^eth^ upon
me All welthe is against me / and all evil comes tofore me in my p^sence. for
certes if there sourde any misery in the ferthest place of the world. that
misery deperteth from that place for to come to me. A what sorrow / certes I am
not good ynowh^ ner of so much valewe that any man shall do any thing at my
request

CErtes madame ansuerde Iason^ me semeth^ that for no thing ye ought to demene
ner make so marvelous sorrow / for ye ar in valewe much more then^e I can
exteme And as to the regard of me if there be any thing licite and honest to
me possible. require ye hit and I shall emploie me in such wise that ye shall
have cause for to be content / And me semeth^ that ye ought to have me excused
in this caas seen the vow in which I am bounden and if I abode here I should
not exployte but lose my time. Ha / a my dear friend and love answerde the lady
when shall I have better cause for to complain and lamente than now. If anon^ I
had lost all my royame / and if I saw all my richesses and cheuanche and all
that I could fine and cheuisshe perisshe in the abismes and depnes of the sea.
All that should not be to me so heavy to bear at my heart ner so great
displaysir as shall be to me to see your departing. for the sea is to terrible.
and the fortunes / prosperitees^ aduersites / and parils rise and sourde on
all sydes^ wherefore I am not certain whether eu ye shall return again or no.
And then^e ought not I to have the vysage banisshid fro all consolacion and
Joy / and ought not my heart to lie on the bed of tribulacion under the
couertour of right mortal distress and between the shetes of bewaylinges^
Alas. alas / think ye what this does / but when I parceyue that there is no
remedy / and that your honor had concluded your departing promisyng to go in
your promisid voyage / I shall bear hit as patiently as to me is possible.
forseen that ye shall promise me faithfully if ye come to your above in your
enterprise of Colchos. that ye shall come again by this Cite for to tell^ me of
your tydinges

When the noble knight understood that the lady condescended by such condition
to his departing he was right Joyous and not with^out cause. considering the
danger where he and all his felawship were in. And then^e he promised to her
and swore right solempnly tofore the rep^sentacion of the goddess pallas
which was there that he should return unto her as soon as he should come to
the above of his enterprise. and that if the gods would give him so good
fortune that he might a live and hole return / Then^e the noble Queen Ysiphile
som^e what reconforted and having a great hope in the retournyng of Jason
cessed her self of her lamentacions For tabregge the matere the day came that
the noble preu Jason should goo to the sea / on which day the noble Prince
and his felawes took l^ue of the noble Queen ysiphile / of the Ladies and
Damoyselles / and thanked them largely of their go^des and good chiere that
they had made to them / And then^e deperted f^o Lennos and went unto the
po^te. but when th^^ should enter into the shippe^ the queen ysiphile presented
unto Jason the ydole of the goddess pallas and many other ydoles of the gods
of the sea. and made him to put them in his shipp^ Sayng that none evil ne
trouble might^ come to him in any wise as long as he kept and held hem in
reverence

When Jason apperceyued the great la^g^sse of the noble Queen ysiphile and the
good love (...) with s^e l^uid him / he thanked her much humbly. and s^n w^^t
to the sea and made to wind up the sail / And thus he and his company
deperted from lennos for to saill^ toward the isle of colchos. of whom I will
leave to speak for this p^sent time and also of Jason and of the queen Ysiphile.
the which when she had born^ her fruit by the space of.ix. months hole / she
was del^uerid of a much fair sone. For to recounte well a long of the right
fair and noble isle of colchos / in devising the manner how hit wa^ first
fou^den by the God Appollo / And also how the country was first enhabyted And
by what kings hit was governed. which is a right difficile and hard thing to
believe for many persons that have not estudied the ancient Cronyques / of
wh^m many ben full hard and doubtable to be believed for the strange and
meruaillous works that been fou^den in many hystories and places

How Appollo was sent by the god Mars into the country where as was the rich
and noble sheep or weder that bare the vl^cse of gold and how he founded there
a cite
FOr to give you knowledge of the nobbe I Will of colchos I shall deporte and tarry
for this present time to speak of the faytes of Jason / and will recompte and
tell in bryef what king^s reigned first in colchos and by what manner and
faco^n hit was known that the rich mouton^ or sheep with the flees of gold
was there^ and also the two meruayllous and terrible booles and the great
^spouentable dragon^ / Then^e for to come unto this history I have fou^den an
old auncien^ cromcle conteynyng / that whilom^e was a king in Athenes named
Iupyter. but this was not that Iupyter that was sone of saturn that reigned
long in Crete which is a much noble country

THis Jupiter then^e king of athenes had / iij / sons / the first was named
arropatreus / that is asmoch as mars in latyn^ / which by the athenyens was
callid god of bataill / for cause of many batailles that he had in his time
against his neighbors of which he had always the victory / the second was apis
which was king of argys / and appollo that reigned in archade wa^ the third /
this appollo was a man of great gouernement^ he introduysed the Archadyens for
to live honestly. Certes he conquered many royames. he had great nombre of
children^. And fynably when they were grown to age^ he deliuerid to them his
lands to govern. And after that departed right secretly from Archade / And in
the astate of a medycine or a phisicien he went in the most part of the
prouynces of the world / he was thus wandering ten yeres^ And at the end of ten
year he arrived at Athenes^ And there found that his brother Mars was newly
deed and passed out of this worlde^ and that there was made to him a temple
which endured after unto the time of the conusion of saint denis. He went
into the temple with an heart replemsshed with teres / and knelid doun^ to the
earth to fore the rep^sentacion of his brother the god Mars Requiring him that
he would show to him that thing that was best for him to do / and that he
would with all his might ensiewe and accomplisshe his doctrine and com^andement

Anon as Appollo had finysshid his prayer^ a great whirling or tourbillon of
wind came suddenly and flapped him on the visage wherwith^ he was astonyed that
he wist not what hit was / And being in this rauisshement him thought that the
god mars said to him / Appollo / appollo. thy prayers ben p^sented in the
heaven to the Gods Thou have seen many meruailes of the worlde^ but that is
nothing in regard of one that thou shall see. and it shall not mow be seyn but
by the / Then^e it pleseth^ us that thou go into pyrre for to make an arc unto
the semblan^ce and likeness of that arc that noe made some time for to save him
and his famyllie from the deluge and flood / after that we will that thou do
charge hit with as great a nombre of pyrriens as hit may receive and that thou
and they put you to the sea therein / And when ye have done so. I shall bring you
into the best isle the most rich and the most fertyle of all the world. which
shall be enhabited by the pyrriens. And thou shall understand that by this isle
is a resort of the sea unto an other litell isle where in is the noble moton^
or sheep with the fliese of gold / the which not long syn was sent by the
gods Juno to frixus and to his suster Helles both enchassed by their
stepmoder for to make them pass the sea which that now is named hellespont by
cause that Helles let her fall into the sea

THe Noble and rich moton^ then^e or sheep of gold is the most meruaillous
best that eu was in the world / and hit must be ones conquered / but that
shall be with great parell and well behoueth^ thereto a meruaillous craft and
mistere And for somoche then^e as thou shall be in the isle habitable in the
which I shall conduyte and bring the / beware and kept the also dear as thou
have thy life / that thou go not into the isle where the no^le moton of gold is
in^ for I have therein ordained three bestes. the which by space of time shall
cast fire flambe fumyer and vemin out of their throtes whereof shall be destroyed
al they that shall descend in that isle / exepte only one unto a certain term /
with this words Appollo came again to him self and thinking on the voys that
he had herd after that he had made his oblaco^ns he deperted out of the temple
and also from athenes / and obeing to the will of the god mars he travailed in
such^ wise by his iournees that he came unto the royame of pirre in the cite of
salathie^ that whilom had founded salathiel^ which was of the lignye of the
hebrews. Then^e Appollo logged him in the hows of a bourgoys named loth^ / and
required him much that he would bring him unto the king of that cou^tre^
which was callid Philitenus. Then^e loth^ accorded unto the request of
Appollo / and brought him to fore Phylitenus / And then^e Appollo made to him
the reverence and syn said unto the king in this manner

Right exellent sire I am comen unto you not only by my pour volente and
auctorite^ but I come in thacomplisshing the com^andement of the god Mars / god
of batailles^ the which has chosen me for to lead certain nombre of thy people
into the best I Will of the world. And for thaccomplisshe the same he has
com^anded the that thou do make for me an arc in such wise as I shall devise
/ And after that thou deliuere to me / iij / honderd of thy men^ with their
wives and children / the which shall enter into the arc with me / and then^
when all this shall be done / the god mars by his g^ee shall bring us unto the isle
forsaide / first tenhabyte and peuple the said yle^ and above that for to
show unto men^ som^e meruaillous works that been there / and to the end that
thou ne think that I be any deceyuor or abuser I oblige me to dye myserably in
caas that I be found in any fault proceeding fro my pertie

When the king philitenus had herd appollo and that he had beholden that he
was of honorable maintiene. he drew him a part and coniured him that he
should declare what he was and of what life. but incontinent when the king so
coniured him he began a litil to wexe ashamed notwithsto^ding he affermed to
him that he was king of archade and sone of Jupiter first king of Athenes and
b^oder un to god Mars And after he declared how he had left his royame and how
he had wandered in the world / and how the god Mars was in the temple and
apperid to him^ and somoche said to him. that the king Iuged him to be most
wise and most discrete man^ of the world. and after acorded to him all that he
had demanded in the favor of the god mars For tabregge the matter appollo did
do make the arc in such wise as him seemed best at the expensis of the king.
And Incontinent when hit was al made and ready / the king did do put there in
iij.C. m^n of his royaume and as many women with two knights of his lignage.
of whom that one was named zechius and that other zethephius / and made hem
promise that they should hold the isle where Appollo should bring them to^ of
his royame in souerainte / and when the pyriens had put in the arc their
necessites for their vytaill and that they had taken leave of the king and his
lords. appollo shette the arc fast to / and then^e suddenly cose and was lift
a tempeste so terrible and so great / that the cords and cables that held the
arc unto the land brak / and then^e it happend that the arc was with an
inpetuous wawe transported into the depnes of the sea

THe king Appollo and all the Pyriens seeing so Inpetuouse tempeste and
tormente supposed that the Arc and all they that were therein should have
perisshed Wherefore they began to cry and demene the gretteste sorrow of the
world and began to make great bewaylinges and murmr upon Appollo. but yet
that worse is. the tempeste continued more and more in such wise that it seemed
that incontinent all the world should have fynysshed Then^e the king philitenus
and his men being arenged upon the side of the poorte. supposing never more to
have seen none of them being in the Arc returned into their howses bewayling
them and weping bytterly / This tempeste dured three days hool. during which
time the king Appollo conforted his men^ the best wise he might and promised
them that with out fault they should be deliuerid from this parill. And so
hit happend them to be. for on the fourth day after their departing from pyre
the tempeste cessed at the son rising. And the noble Arc was cast in a
meruayllous Regorte of the sea being between two Isles. of which that one was
great and that other less

INcontinent that the king Appollo felt that the tempest of the sea cessed
litil and a litil / and after aperceyuid that the arc was a ground fast. and
the wind left his strong blowing^ and on that other side the wawes were in
rest / he went up into the highest of the arc and opend a window for to
behold and see where they were / and then^e he apperceyuid first the air well
attemprid and the son^e shynyng fair and clear / after he cast his sight
dounward. and then^e he saw the / ij / noble yles / whereof the more isle was
next unto the arc Which seemed to him so fair and so delicious that he knew
plainly that it was the propre isle that was promised to him And that other isle
being next that. was that isle that the habitacion was defended to him for the
great meruailes that there should fall. And then^e he was so glad Joyous and
reconforted. that he began to sing an hye thankinges and louinges unto the god
mars / and incontinent when he had so done he began to call upon the two
knights zechius and zeth^phius^ And also his oste loth^ / to whom he said
that they ought render and yield graces and thankinges unto the God of
bataylles / And that they arrived into the lan^e of promyssion^ Anon as these
two noble knights zechyus and zethephius and the other men and women
understood these tydinges they rose up on her feet / made clean their visages
and clensid their eyes of their teeris and wepinges looked up an hygh^ and
required Appollo that he would opene the doors and windows of the arc to
the end that they might see that land of promyssion

APpollo heering this Request and considering the right great displaisir in
which they h^dde ben. and the right hye gladness that they had recouured^
Opened all the entrees of the arc and let goo out the Pyryens showing to
them the ferme land that they had founden. which they found so noble / so
dilectable and so fertyle in all goods that them seemed that they were in a
verray paradys For the land was right fertyle. the pastures^ and the herbs
sweet smelling^ the trees charged with fruit. the wodes and hye forestes full
of wild bestes and veneson^. when Appollo had visited this noble land and had
well comprised and considerid the circuyte and the places of the same / he
founded in a forest an awter in the name of god Mars and did to him sacrefice^
And in the same place the Amazon^es founded after a temple unto the goddess
deane. In which Jason and Medea saw e^he other first and acqueynted them as
it shall be said here after and declared more a long in his place

AFter the fondacion of this awter when the sacrefic^ was done Appollo did do
call the / ij / knights zechyus and zethephius and also loth^ with the people
that he had brought / and demanded them what they would do and what was
their entencion / And then^e they ansuerde as with one voys / Certes* our
entencion and will is to abide here and live and dye / we desire neu to depart
/ for this shall be the sepulture of all us and of our eyres unto the end of the
world / the honye that here habou^deth^ shall be our mete. and we shall labor
and culty^e the earth with good vygnes / we shall enhabite with people the low
montaignes and the territoires / and thus we shall live in hye felicite if it be
your plaisir. If it be my playsir ansuerde Appollo / if it had not be only for
to have distribu^d this so noble a land / know ye for certain that I had not
abandon^ed my self to the tempests and parils of of the sea / ne to the great
orages and tourbillou^s of the impetuouse windes^ hit pleseth me right well
that this noble country be your habitacion / but syn your entencion is such /
it is above all things necessary greatly for you and for your well and
recom^endacion / that ye render and do your pain to edeffye a cite and that ye
close hit with walls tours and yates to the end that none may come run upon
you pylle. rob ne trauaylle you in other manner. and after hit behoueth^ for
to com^ynyque to geder by good policy in such^ faco^n that the hardy and
puissau^t of body and ^orage / habylle them with arms for to resist
thenterpryses of your enemies if any come for to grieve you / the sage and
wysemen shall enduce and teache the rude people and hard of entendeme^t The pour
shall be holden and bounden to labor each man after hi^ degree and calling /
And the most subtle shall devise thing propices for you as toures harnois and
other habyllement seruyng to keep you in time of doubt / And with this they
shall ordeyne solemn edifices and houses for the cite in the place thereto most
propice and couenable

When the pyriens had understand Appollo / all they ansuerde freely that they
would accomplisshe to their power all that he would cou^ceyle them / and that
he should be their fader. and they his children^. Then^e they chose a place
couenable to bilde their cite / and tarried not long after but that they began
to bylde and house a long by the sea side in such wise that by space of time
they founded and bilded a Right noble cite and closed with walls dichis and
yates / Appollo named this cite Iacoynte / the pyriens edified in the mids
thereof a much sumptuous palace. And on that other side zechius zethephius and
loath made also many houses / and by space of time their generation multeplied
greatly and meruaillously. whereof Appollo thanked the god Mars and did to him
sacrefice. This don he assembled on a day all the people and said to him in
this manner tofore hem all

People of god Mars when I considere the well and the valor of your habitaco^n
ye ben much holden to the goddes^ wherefore I pray you from hens forward that
ye serve him with good heart. And after that I pray you that ye norisshe
pees and concord to geder / And that ye kep^ you from all dyuysion and
rancour. and I pray you to banisshe from your corages pride / hate couetise
glouton^ye and al other vices. and consequently I conceyle you that at this
time ye constitute upon you iuges the two virtuous knights zechius and
zethephyus and that ye to them obey souerai^ly / and if ye do the^e things
certainly all good^s shall (...) in yow^ And if ye do not I declare to you
for trout^e (...) in short time in this Cite shall not abide board ner how^
standing ner one stone upon an other. Appollo had not so sone finysshid thise
words but that all they th^re stondyng opend her mowthes and cried with an
hye voys saying Truly Appollo thou art the god of sapyence as long as we live
we will have none other Judge but the / And to the we shall submytte us and all
our affayres^ And desiring thyn holy sacrefices / manners / and honest doctrines
to ens^ewe to our powers. we will that thou be our pastor or herdman^ / and we
shall be thy sheep

When Appollo had understand this that said is he answerde to hem and said.
Certes fair lords hit apperteyneth not to me to receive the great honor that
ye all offreand present to me. ye know how that zechi^s and zethephyus ben
of your nacion^ And I am here allone and a stranger. hit is among you euydent
and notoyre. that ye shall not take in patience my corre^^ion as ye should do
of zechyus and zethephyus. And for so much I pray you that with so great
charge and burden ye leye not on my back. for hit is none need. and for to
say the verite zechius and zethephyus ben two wise knights well attempred and
propice to ex^^rsice those dygny^^s. And therefore ye ^ught to receive thein^
for certes ye ben holden so to do and then^e your well shall follow and be
euydent. and ye so doing pees and love shall be ^oted in you. And there shall be
no man that shall be so ha^dy to conspire any Rumor. Rancour / Rebellion / ne
machine any troble in no (...) of the world. And sayng thise words all the
(...) to murmr. And zechius and his felawe ze^^^phyu^ hering this parliament
to geder with loth^ and som^e other princip^ls then^ there that herd.
considerid the people would in no wise break their oppinion / concluded to make
an answer such as foloweth^. which loth^ pronounced and ^^yde in this manner

APpollo in no wise put no doubt in this work for so much as thou art
among us of unknown generation. Thy sapyence and wysedom is more playsau^te to
the people. that the naissau^ce or birthe* of zechyus and of zethephius. Thou
art the right myrrour of our doctrine. the patron of our policie^ the right
oustyll that polisshith^ and enlumyneth^ us and our rude ingenyes. Certes the
two good knights zechius and zethephius thank the of the right great honor
that thou do to them / And they being adjoined with the people will. that
thou have upon us and the Cite souerayn seygnourye. and therefore will thou
no more se^^e weyes so contrepeysed / but enploye thy courage after the taste of
our desires. for hit is ordained and concluded. that thou shall be our king.
And for to supporte the shall be com^ysed zechius and zethephius thy lieutenau^ts
/ the which by thy int^^duccyon shall have the charge and thought under the of
the com^yn besines and small things. of which they shall have the knowleche
for to determine

INcontinent as loth^ had finisshid his proposicion / at thinstau^ce of all the
people Appollo accorded in all thing unto their will. And then^e forth^with^
two of the

INcontinent when Appollo apperceyued and understood thise thinges^ and among
all other he beheld him that was thus come and had put him in the sea. Certes
he was sore abasshid. but for to know all the tydinges / he made to row ner
him^ and found that the water where he wa^ in. boilled by great hete al about
his body / The pour felawe incontinent that he knew the king appollo his
lord / began passing pietously to escrie upon him weping and sayng. Ha A sire
Appollo if hit be possible to the / help and deliuere me from this mortal
dau^ger^ When appollo saw the pour felaw in such desolaco^n the teeris fill
doun^ from (...) eyes. and f^r asmoche as the water boilled so about him he
had great pite / and demanded of him what eyled him so to cry and weep And
from whens that water came that so boilled about him. and axid syn where was
zec^^us. Alas ansuerde the pour felawe which labourid living there to the
death in a dolor and payn^ inestymab^^. Pray ye sire for zechius and for his
felaws. for I have seen all* one after another dye in a mortell destresse and
so anguiss^ously. that uneath that is creature living that could veraily
acompte and tell hit to you

When Appollo he^de speak of the deth^ of zechius and his felaws he was so
soroufull that he wist not what to do / but ansuerde to the pour felaw and
said by great admyracion. how may that be fair sire / for I saw right now
zechius and all his felaws that were with him when they took land in colchos
in descendyng from the ship / Alas dear sire ansuerde then^e the felawe / Hit
is well Reason that I recompte and tell you the trouth^ and verite of the
manner of this cruel adventure. Certes sire hit is very trouth^ that
incontinent that zechius and we other entrid into the isle / we apperceyuyd from
far in a passing fair medowe a living best fedyng all of fyn gold. And was
as great as an horse of the faco^n and form of a sheep or moton^. Then^e we
concluded to geder with one will / that we would have taken him / and then^e
we went forth and supposed to have taken hit by force or other wise. And for
to so do we marched the derward to our evil health / for anon^ after and
right suddenly sprang out of a temple the most fair and the most rich that I
ever saw / a much meruayllous dragon^ and ferdful with three tong^s casting
fire and flambe wi^h smoke out of his throte^ and forthwith incontinent sprang
also out of hooles in the earth two much horrible booles having legs and
feet all of coper / their horns were great and sharp. their eyes gretter and
more reed then^ boyllyng coper or metal / the which three bestes so dredefull
disgorged and cast out fire of their throtes and venym upon us in such
faco^n. that zechius and all the other deyde there in such payn^ and dolor
that was never like thereto recorded^ and of us.xxx. felaws there is none escaped
exept my self which was last and ferthest behind / for when I apperceyuid
the meschyef so great I put me to flight / but I could not so fast flee / but
that the terrible dragon^ cast upon me a gobet of the most detestable
infeccion that ever was / the which does me somoche payn^ and meschief and
holdeth^ me in such a brennyng in all my body that I must needs take by
dolourouse deth^ the end of this world. wherefore I require you that ye goo
no^ner Colchos

without nombre floted here and there in the sea. and thus by this way they
were all lost and spent. of the whiche-auenture all they that were then^ at the
port beholding were sore esbayed and not without cause / for never tofore was
seen so meruaillous a tempeste / and thought well that it went not well. and
said that one to that other that their gods were angry with them when such
tempest came to them there to their great dom^age and prejudice

How the knight zethephius conspired against Appollo the king and how they had
battle to geder
AFter this evil adventure the king Appollo and they that were with him returned
unto the palace enclinyng their heedes adoun^ and showing that anoye had
enterprised them when they were come to the palace all they bewayl^d zechius /
and during this sorrow / the wife of zechius named Mena came thither for to here
tidinges of her husbonde. and hit was said to her that he was left deed in the
isle of colchos / wherefore she demened so meruaillous sorrow that she fill to the
earth al in a spasme and a swou^ne / and after came to her self / and then^e she
rent of her attire and drew her h^^r out of her head by much aspre anger and
sorrow / in such a faco^n that forth^with^ she was deliuerid of a child which
she had conceyuid of her lord and husbonde / the which deyde as soon as it was
born^ / for it had not his full time / for the deth^ of which child the anger
and sorrow was much the more^ Appollo then^ wenyng to conforte her / did all
that he could / but yt halpe no^ ner profited no thing / and made her to be
brought into his house for the better to make her wepinges and lamentaco^ns at
her will And there was none that might comfort her. The women The king. and
friends of them that were deed with zechius semblably made great sorrow. during
which sorrow. Appollo visited often times Mena / and found that she had
continuelly the teeris in her eyes / how well she was a much fair lady / By
haunting from day to day Appollo knew the great and good love that she had to
her husbonde. and that in no manner might forgete him began to wexe amorous of
the lady in so much that he required her to be his wife / And she agreed and
acorded thereto in such wise that the one espoused that other And engendryd on
her a daughter / the which was borne in good term and was named fanoles

Among all other things zethephius began to have envy upon the king Appollo
for asmoche as his glory encresid daily / and more and more. This miserable
envy encresid in his courage. and him seemed that if of Appollo and of mena came
a sone. that sone should succeed to the royame after appollo / for which cause
he employed him self with all his power to conplaire and plese a pertye of the
citezeyns. and when he felt him in their grace / he assembled hem on a day in
his house and said to them in this manner. My brethren and good friends ye
know well that I am of your lignage And that all my life I have conused
louyngly among you / and in like wise mine au^cetres with youres have had always
entier alian^ce / this considerid my heart iugeth^ that ye owe me good will
and desire mine encrees and honor And for somoche as your power is right great
in this cite^ I pray and require you. if hit so hap that appollo go fro life
to deth^ that ye will have my sone for recom^ended and that he may be king
after him as ye know well that he is thereto worthy

THe friends of zethephius hering these words. all accorded with good heart
to do for him all that they might. Then^e zethephius promised to them many
great things in caas they would make Feris his sone king^ and promised so much
good that they coniured the deth^ of the king Appollo^ And in deed they made
covenant that they should slay him if they found him at their auantage

AFter this coniuroyson^ then^e that these miserable and peruers traytres were
withdrawn into their howses They co^mened with their neighbors of the death of
the king appollo^ and promised them great nombre ^f money if they might come
and obtain their intent / some there were covetous desiring their singular
prouffit accorded unto this sedico^n / but also some there were that in no wise
would asente th^rto^ but allowed the great p^eudhem^ye and wisdom of Appollo.
and showed well that they had him better in g^ce than zethephius Thus among them
began to meue and rise many rancours. discordes and debats / and this rumor
roos in so hye terms and so plainly / that zethephyus and his accomplices
couuertly murdered many of them that would not acorde unto their trayson^. and
somo^^ multeplied these outrageous sins / that when some of the welwillars of
the king appollo saw their felawes murdrid / they drew to the king appollo and
told to him the machinaco^n of zethephius / and the outrageous sins that his
felaws did. and required him moch^ that he would take heed and entende to
their fayt / and to find such^ remedy to keep his life well / and honor and
the prouffit of the com^yn well

THe king Appollo was meruaillously troubled and had great sorrow in his courage
when he was adutised of these hard tydinges / how well he conduysed him right
wisely / for with all diligence he did take enformaco^n of these things. and
found that they had said to him the ve^^te and trouth^. and that zethephius
seduysed the people against him by tyranny al euydente. and that continuelly he
had in his house an.C. men of evil life / the which com^ysed all the evil they
could think upon them that they found not of their bende^ the great trouble
and displaisir of king Appollo doubled then^e when he knew for troth that it
was true that he was adutised of. Notwithstanding he endured the malice of
zethephius and his accomplices a certain space^ but when he apperceyued their
^du^te / and that fro day to day they a payred more then^e amended / he sent
to zehtephius / that he should do Justice on his servants and such as were
culpable of the deth^ the which tyrannysed in the cite. and if he would not /
he would seche remedy him self

When zethephius understood the message of the king Appollo. He ansuerde to him
with a mou^th full of felonnye / that he was wise enough for to correct his
servants. and that he would not do but at his plaisir / And then^e the
messager came and reported this answer to king appollo / the which he herd.
Appollo deliberid in him self that he would suffer a litil for to see how his
enemies would mayntene hem / during which time he held him well assured in his
palais. but it was not long after but zethephius and his folk conmised more
outrages and cruelte then^e they did tofore / in somoch^ that all the people
roos and meuid on a day And there were som^e that came under Appollo. And the
other went to the traytres. the which assemblid in this manner by great pride
that surmou^ted on them and sent to Appollo that he should prestly depart out
of the palace and goo his way out of the cyte^ or else they would well that
he knew that they were his mortell enemyes^ Anon as Appollo had receyuyd this
mandement he understood well that the thing was in evil term if he put not
payn^ to subdue and put under these traytres by arms / wherefore he callid the
people them that were of his party and said to them / Fair sirs ye know well
ynow^ ye have me constituted king above you / how well me thinketh^ zethephius
would take from me this dignite. And ^f fayte he is declared mine enemy^ what is
to be done here to. They answered. Thou art our kyng^ other king than the we
will not have during ou^lyf / and for so much as every king is bounden to keep
and defend his people / And semblably ben all people bounden to expose body and
goods for their king Hit semeth^ us expedient that without longer toryeng we
ought to goo and assail thyn enemy and ours / to the end to punisshe him and
his accomplices

When Appollo had understand this that said is he accorded to the same lightly
and put him anon to arms. And so did all they of his party. and as soon
as they were all in point / they went on the way toward the market place. and
there comen the king sent one of his knights unto zethephius to signyfie to
him that he should come to Appollo for to amend his mesfaytes of which he and
his conplices were charged with / then^e zethephius ansuerde that he would go
unto his enemy but that shall be said with strength^ of men of arms so
puyssau^t and strong / that hit had been better for him that he had never
set foot in this country. And say to him hardily that if he be well
cou^ceylled that he and his welewillars be not fou^den to fore my strength /
but that they goo so far that of them we here never after tydinges / As Soon
as the knight had understand this that said is he returned unto his lord and
recou^ted to him what he had exploited / And zetheph^ius with^oute lengrr
^arieng marched forth^ acompanyed of his conplices al armed to the place where
he supposed to find appollo as he that was advertised of thenterprise of the
king. and went so ferforth^ that they found their adusaires the which were so
esmeuyd upon them / that incontinent that they had espied each other. they
escried them to the deth^. and ran upon each other armed one with an basenet
on the head an other armed the body. one bering a clubbe. an other a sword
evil fourbousshed / and without other parliament holding they began a bataile
upon the market felonnous and hard meruaillously. In casting terrible cries one
and other as it had been thondre comen doun^ from heaven. and with this all the
women^ and litil children of the cite came ren^yng and cried weping so right
anguisshously that hit was great pite to see hem make their bewailinges and
sorrow

THus as ye may understand began the bataylle of the Cytezeyns the one against
that other / and in the coming to gyder they smote each other cruelly without
having regard sauf only to slay each other. but the king appollo fletheris and
loath put hem forth^ among their enemies so far in gyuing pesau^t strokes and
terrible on the right side and on the lift side by such virtue that the place
was anon^ dyed and weet with the blood of the malefactours^ and they did so
knyghtly and cheuaulerously / and in especial Appollo. that there was no traytre
but that he tremblid tofore hem / And every man began to make place to the
noble king. Then^e zethephius had such sorrow that he came and put him tofore
the berde of the knight Fletheris and of loath And he had with him.x. of his
best fightars^ and such was their adventure that with one stroke the gentil
knight Fletheris smote down zethephius to the earth among the deed bodies and
took him^ And in this he^te Appollo and loath fought so sore with the other and
so eygrely that they slew the most part. And hit was not long after that the
traitors knew that their capitoyne was sore hurt and taken. wherefore they
turned there back and put them in flight in all parties a long by the Ryue
of the cite and so sparklid abroad

How the king Appollo gaf to his daughter the ^^ll^ and manner for to conquer
the moton^ or sheep of gold^ which came after to Medea
When the gentil king Appollo saw that his morta^^ enemy was holden and that
his accomplices put them to flight incontinent cessed the bataylle. and returned
to his palace with great glory. And each man cried. Health be given to the
king Appollo. Many of the p^incipall of the people came then^e to fore the king
and would there ^aue slain the untrue zethephyus. But zethephyu^ Required them
humbly mercy and confessid his great fault And therwith^ came there his wife that
kneled to the earth tofore the nobles and the people and required them of g^ce
for her husbond so humbly that the king had pytie of her. and saved zethephius
life. But that same day he accused all them that had com^ysed the great euyll^
of whom the king Appollo did do Iustice^ And after this gaf to Fletheris the
office of zethephius / And from this day forthward the cite was nourisshid in
pees the space of many years to the loving and preysing of Appollo

ZEth^phius dismyssed of his office as said is attemprid his courage and
governed him so well and discretly that he recouurid the love and good grace of
the king. ye in such wise that by the meue of Mena / the king Appollo gaf in
marriage his daughter Phauoles unto the sone of zethephius named Pheris. This
Pheris was a wise young man. prudent. discrete. attemprid and much louid the
gods. all virtues and good Justice. when they had conuersed with him a
certain space / he considerid two things. the preudom^ye and wisdom of Pheris
was that one And that other was that he would return in to greece. he
constituted in this royame Pheris king. And the people confermed him^ And hit
was not long after that mena departed fro the life by deth^. whereof appollo made
meruaillous sorrow. And then^e when he had long wept the deth^ of his wife. and
felt his end to approach he called on an ^uyn his daughter Phauoles and said
to her. My dear daughter I take leave of the^ for I must secretly depart from
this country. and allone return into Greece where I was born^ how well first
er I depart I late the Queen of this isle / whereof I have in mine heart great
Joy. And for as much as I know thy wit thy discresion and thy vertues^ I
shall deliuere to the. the bylle that the god Mars has wreton^ conteynyng all
the manner how me shall do for to conquer the noble moton^ or sheep of gold
in the isle of colch^s. and for to destroy all the terrible bestes that been in
the same yle^ And I com^ande that to no man living ne to no creature of the
world thou show hit not But if hit be in the end of thy life unto a daughter
that shall come of the. unto whom thou shall make her swear that semblably she
shall not show hit to no person sauf only to her daughter. And so from
daughter to daughter Hit pleseth the god Mars that this bille be kept upon
pain of deth^ unto the time that out ^f Greece shall come a knight in to this
palace that shall be worthy to see it And shall conquer the noble moton or
sheep of gold

Wyth^ these words the king deliuerid the bill to his dear daughter / the
which contained in substan^ce the terms that follow. If thou love thy life and
wilt adventure thy self for to conquer the moton^ or sheep of gold. hit is of
pure necessite that thou have the habyts that appollo was clad with all at the
our that this bill was deliuerid to him / After hit behoueth^ that thou have
his armures and that thou were his gown above them. And of the other clothes
thou make sacrefice unto the god Mars / and put there with a bole whereof thou
shall keep the blood / After this thou shall take the powldre of the sacrefice
and pu^te hit in three parties. that is to wete one^ with the blood of the bole
/ And this myxtion^ shall have such virtue* that if thy body be anointed
therwyth^ the fire ne the venym of the dragon^ and of the two meruaillous
booles that keep the moton^ may not noye the / Unto the regard of the second
part of this poulder thou shall meddle hit with glue And with this glue thou
shall enoynte the mosels of thise two meruayllous booles^ to whom thou may
then^e seurely approach notwithstanding that they cast fire against the
dismesurably / But when their mosels ben englued they may then^ cast no more
fire ne venym / Then^e thou shall go to the dragon^ / whom thou must slay by
thy strength and by thy hardynesse. And then^e when thou shall have slain him
thou shall return to the two meruaillous booles / and hyde their eyen^ And
thou shall yoke hem and make hem to turn four rodd of land. the which thou
shall sow with the teth^ of the dragon^ that then^ is ded. And after thou
shall make them to harowe hit / And then^ suddenly shall grow of this earth
many Geants armed / which shall arise against the. And when hit shall comen to
smyting / cast upon them the therthe part of the pouldre And anon they shall
fight to gyder^ and each of them shall slay that other. And then^e when thou
shall have done all this that said is^ then^e thou may take the noble moton^
or sheep of gold and conquer hit / And then^ thou shall flee him. and with
the body reserved the vliese of gold thou shall make sacrefice to the god Mars
kneling and humylieng thy self tofore him thou shall say this oroyson^ that
foloweth^

MArs my god that by the suffraunce of the God of nature have puissau^ce for to
change the nature of bestes^ And that by thy propre virtue conduytest all
batayles and bring them to thy playsire. I thank the wyth^ all my heart of
that thou have made me to doo^ And pray the humbly that thou receive my
sacrefice in gree. And that thou will conduyte me with mine honor and bring
me unto my country / And thus when thou have finisshid thy prayer / thou may
return with glory in to thy country and be seized with the noble fliese of
gold

MY dear daughter said then^e Appollo lo here the writing that I have spoken of
/ And after that lo here mine habytes that be requysite for to obtain the
conquest of the sheep of gold / And mine armures ben in the temple of god Ma^s
/ and there shall abide unto the time that this noble conqueste shall be done.
And therefore keep them well and soyngneusly that no danger come to you / and
that I charge the by the com^andement of the gods / And I pray you for all
the plaisir that ye may do to me that no person be advertised of my
departing. Then^e Phanoles promised and swear to her fader that she should do
to her power all that he had required her and charged her with. And then^e
they took leave each of other weeping right tenderly. And syn went Phanoles
with the king Pherix For hit was night and the good king Appollo abode in his
chamber unto on the morn^ erly. and then^e deperted al allone and entrid into a
litil boot al propice which he had do make then^e he recom^anded him in the
guard and keeping of the gods And then^e a wind smote on the ship that
brought him upon the deep see. and ye shall understand. that the same day the
king Pherix was well advertised that his fader in law was goon^ and departed /
he began to demene and make a meruayllous sorrow. and so did all the peple^ but
when they saw that they could not have him again ner recouure him They
com^anded him to the guard of the god mars. Then^e the king Pherix began to
have the governance of the royame / and conduysed it in such wise that in
short time he gate the love of all the people and of the nobles of the royame

THe king Pherix then^e after the departing of the old king Appollo had of his
wife Phauoles a daughter named Ortis. This daughter came to age and was married
unto a noble man of greece named Oetes / the which by fortune of the sea was
brought into this country in the time that the king Pherix was in his old and
ancient days / the ladies of Sychye came then^e into this march. and well
supposed to have gotten and taken this cite of Iacoynte by assault But the
inhabitants of the cite bare hem so strongly that this multitude of women were
constrained to cesse of their enterprise. whereof they had great sorrow and
assieged the cite And during their siege they made the temple of the goddess
deane^ of whom is spoken tofore^ this temple is like to an other that they made
in Ephese

DVring their siege Oethes which was strong and cheualerous and much
vayllyant in Arms and of great conduyte^ scarmusshed wyth^ hem many times to
his honor. And did so moche^ that when the Ladies had performed their temple.
and that they considered that the cite was inprenable by assault / and also
that the citezeyns came not out against them in bataille. wherefore they lost
their time / they raised their siege and returned unto the sea. of whom some
other there were that went unto the isle of colchos. but they that so adventured
them returned neu again. after the departing of this assemble of ladies / the
king Pherix gaf his daughter to Oetes^ and made them to wedde that one to that
other in the temple of dyane which was meruaillous rich / Then^e anon after
pherix and phanoles deyde / and Oetes was the third king of this isle by the
assente of all the people / This king Oetes found a mine of gold / whereof he
did do make vaissell and other vtensilles necessary and propice unto his
household. this was the most rich king of all the world in that time. he did
do make an ydole al of fyn gold representing the god Mars. and another
rep^senting the gods deane the which were in a wode ede^fied of gold wherein
he had al manner of wild bestes. After he did do make a fair gardyn of
plaisan^ce / in which he founded a temple unto the gods venus unto whom he
did do make a rich image which was al of fyn gold And about the same were
fifty men and as many women that desired and required each other of love. and
they were made with so amerous maners^ that al they that beheld them / were
lightly and sone meuyd to luxure / Hit is not to be vnreme^brid that among all
these things the said king Oethes* had a daughter by his wife ortis / This
daughter grew and was named Medea. and becam passing beauteuous and fair. yet
he had another daughter by his wife and a sone. the daughter was named Caliope
and the sone was named abserthius At the burthe of this Abserthius the queen
Ortis was so seek that she leyde her doun^ in her mortal bed. and called to
her / her daughter Medea. and deliuerid to her all tho things that the king
Appollo had deliuerid to his daughter Phauoles touching the fayte of the
conquest of the golden flyese / And also taught her many enchantements^ and
with this she gaf to her a Ryng of gold wherein was a stone of such virtue
that hit should make them inuysible that bare hit / And this done she passed
out of this world wherefore Oetes / Medea / and Caliopes demened meruayllous
great sorrow / And there I will rest of this sorrow and shall recompte what was
the end of the king Appollo

How the king Appollo arrived at the port of Sta / rille. And how he departed
secretly fro the king Serath^ and arrived at the isle of Colchos and of his
deth^ and how the king Serath^ confessid Appollo to be a god
When the king Appollo was allone on the sea as said is^ he abandon^ed him unto
the fortune of the wyndes and of the waters confyeng and trusting in the g^ce
of the gods. And his fortune was such. that he arrived at the port of
Starille a cite of the royaume of Pyre And there fond that the king Philitenus
lay there passing seek / And then^e went to him^ and after the Reuerences
made. recounted to him fro point the point all that was befallen to him and his
people / how that they had fond the isle that the gods had promised to him.
and how they had made the cite / and how they had made him king and how zechyus
and his felaws deyde in the isle of colchos / how zethephius had conspired
against him. how he had made his sone pherix king And how he was departed thens
allone. The king Philitenus had much marvel of these things. And made great
chere to Appollo after his power^ but anon^ after he deyde and after him
succeeded in his royame a sone that he had which was named Serath^ / Then^e
when Appollo saw that Serath^ was obeyed king of Pyrre / he came to him on a
day to take leave for to return into his country. but Serath^ would not that
he should depart / And required him Instantly that he would use the remenau^t
of his life with him. Appollo excused him and took leave yet ones. but in no wise
serath^ would accord thereto. And when Apoollo saw this and felt that he
might not long live / he departed thens on an even so secretly that no man
knew til on the morn. and then^e on the morn they knew it by the report of one
of his knights / which certefied him that he had met and recou^trid him
in a place that he named

Incontinent that the king Serath^ understood these tydinges. he was sore
trobled / for he louid parfaitly Appollo / And forth^with^ he took his horse and
in entencion to bring him again / he rode after him acompany^d of two good
knights of his court / but he could never outake him til that he was come into
the isle of colchos where he found him passing seek and laboring in the
extreme draughtes of deth^. The anoye of king Serath^ redoubled when he saw
and found Appollo in this estate and wept Then^e the king Appollo defended him
that he should go no ferther into the isle of Colchos for to conquer the moton
or sheep of gold. And syn recom^anded him to the Gods And that done expired
his life. for which deth^ the king Serath^ and his knights were terribly sory^
And conclu^ed that they would bear the body into their country / and make for
him a fair and rich sepulture / and then^e they garnisshed the body with
great foyson of candellis for to wake that night / but when hit was about
mydnight and that all the lumynaire brende about the body of Appollo^ All
went out and quenchid suddenly / And then^e must the king Serath^ and his
knights wake the remenau^t of the night without any light or clerenes whereof
they had great meruaile^ And on the morn when the day apperid it happend that
they found not the body of king Appollo. but in the place where they had left
it the day to fore / they found an awter of cristall passing c^ere / upon
which was an image of fyn gold so quikly made after the faco^n of Appollo.
that it seemed proprely his person. wherefore the king Serath^ seeing this
My^racle knelid down on both his knees to the earth to fore him and worshipped
it / And then^e he herd a voys that said to him. Serath^ seek not Appollo but
among the gods / he hath^ praid for the and for all them that shall come to
th^is sepulcre / and therefore know thou that thou shall have good fortune.
and all they that shall come hither by good devotion shall have answer of
things that they shall demand / and here with the voys made silence. and the
king Serath^ confessid then^e openly that with^out error appollo was a god^
after these th^inges he did do make in the honor of him a temple en
signefieng all that he had seen and herd to ben true / and fro then^e forth^on
the greeks were acustomed to come to this temple fro fer country to worshipe
him and diligently demand and enquire of their destinees^ And among all other
Peleus went theder as said is. And thus endeth^ the history of Appollo and
his faytes. And now I will return for to speak of the faytes and vaillyau^ces
of the noble and preu Jason / for that is our principal matere

How the king Oetes receyuid Jason into his cite. and how Medea louid Jason and
brought him to the temple of venus / and how the old woman enchanted the bed
of Iason^
When Iason^ was departed from Lennos. And that he had sacred his ship unto the
goddess Pallas and to the goddess of the sea / he saylled by many Iournees
from one coost to an other / that in the end Argos ruled so his course by the
son that on a day he arrived in the isle that he had desired to find by a
great storm and impetuouse fortune that by force were constrained for to take
the regorte or goulf where as the isle of colchos was by / hit was not long
after that when argos had brought his ship in this goulf or arm of the sea /
that the son^e went down / and then^e as argos thought where he might best
cast ancre and make his ship fast / hit happend that he saw tofore him the
cite of Iacoynte^ and on that one side of the isle of colchos there sprang out
suddenly tourbillou^s of fire so terryble that of feer that he had in beholding
hit he began to cry. When Jason / hercules / and Theseus and the other
kniyhtes of Greece herd the master thus cry. they sprang up and came to him /
and the master told them the cause of his cry. and syn showed to hem the cite
and the isle. and asseured hem how they were comen to the end of their vyage^ and
of this matter they devised so long that speking thereof their ship came to the
port into the propre place where the arc of king Appollo was comen at that
time when they came first into the land. Then^e the master of the ship cast
his ancres into the sea. Then^e Jason rendrid loving and preysing unto the
gods. and so did hercules. Then^e they sent theseus unto the king Oetes for
to signefie to him their coming / and for tenquere if this was the country that
they sought / Certes theseus went and did his message in such wise. that the
king Oetes presented to him his palais and sent unto the noble Jason four of
his knights that required him on the kings behalue that he would take his
herberow in his palais / and he was to him right welcome^ And when Jason had
understand the will of the king by the f^ure knights / he promised them that
with a good will he would come theder^ and then^e he entrid into the cite
which was no^le and fayr^ and how well it was night at that time. yet was the
cite as light as it had been day by the clarte and resplendour of torches^
cresettes and other fires^ that the king had do make in the cite right notably
acompanyed for to feste these greeks

YE may well understand that the right noble Jason entrid into th^is cite
acompanyed of Hercules and his felaws that were right rich clad and habilled
wi^h^ cloth^ of gold and of silk / The street by which they passed for to go
to the palace was on two renges hye and low peupled of ladies of damoiselles /
of knights bourgeys marchan^s mayde^s and young people beholding their coming
and ordenan^ce / And when Jason was comen unto thentre^ of the palace he fond
there the noble king Oetes / which was set in astate royal for to feste
Jason and his companye^ And receyuyd Jason right honorably as chyef of them
all. And then^e when he had welcomed them. he took him by the hand and led
him unto his palace And anon as they went upon the steyres for to goo up
Jason looked into a wyndowe And beholding he espied the fair Medea among many
ladies. to whom he took non^ other head as for this time. but hit was not so on
her part For she began to behold him so affectuously for his great beauty.
that he was more in her grace than I can tell you For tabregge the matter Jason
and all his company passed forth^ by this window where Medea was and came into
an halle where the tables were couerd / And then^e whiles they made ready the
souper the king Oetes began to demand the gentil knight Jason and after many
words he began to say to him in this manner

Jason fair sire I know for trouth^ that ye be so^e of king Eson like as
theseus your felaw hath^ said to me. But I know not whyther ye entende to goo
/ ne what thing ye seche / wherefore I pray you by manner of a pass time that
ye will a litil recompte to me of your astate and enterprise if hit be
possible that ye so do may in any manner And I promise you that if I may be
propice in any faco^n for the love of your fader. whom I have some time known I
shall deliuere to you aid and confort in all that in me shall be possible /
Sire ansuerde then^e Jason I thank you humbly of the great honor that ye
present to me. and syn it must needs be that ones ye must know the cause
wherefore I am descended into your country / I declare to you that I have
enterprised for to goo into the isle of colchos notwythstonding the parils
which ben much to doubt and not with out cause / And with this I have
made auowe that I shall never return into Greece unto the time that I have
conquerid and shall bring with me the sheep o^ fliese of gold / And if I
may not make an end of this enterprise hercules my felawe shall adventure him /
wherefore I require you that of this enterprise ye will conceylle me to your
power / Certes Jason said then^e the king ye have made a litill vow. How sire
said Jason how so^ for asmoche ansuerde the king as by any adventure or fortune
ye enter into this isle of colchos / hit is not possible that ye ever return
hither again / for there be in that isle two great and meruaillous bulls
^^^enymed com^ysed to the keeping of the moton^ or flees of gold. whereof ye
spack. Also th^r is com^ysed for the guard of the same the most terrible and
the most crymynel dragon^ that eu was spoken of or seen The which three bestes
cast continuelly fire and venym out of their throtes. which shall slay you
without remedy incontinent that ye approach them / the which things
considerid syn that ye have demanded me conceyle. and also that euy noble man
is bounden to g^ue conceyle to them that been evil informed and conceyled^ I
pray you and conceyle as my propre sone that ye cesse of this your enterprise /
for if ye do other wise all the gold of the world may not save you. and there
fore thenke well what ye have to do before ye put you in such a danger I
conceyle you as thaugh^ ye were mine own sone or my brother germayn / and
herewith they left their words

THe soupper was ready. wyth^ these words the king satte at the table between
Jason and Hercules and sent after Medea and Caliope. which were set tofore
him / this done he com^anded the other greeks to sytte at an other table where
they were richely seruid. But when hit came for to ete the noble maid Medea
entrowbled at that time her mayntene / and cast her regard upon Jason where
she rested longer then^e hit apperteyned to her contenau^ce. for Jason seemed to
her more fair that he was at the first time^ and he was so playsant and
agreeable / that when she herd recompte among other devises and things that he
was comen for to conquer the moton^ or flees of gold / she iuged that this
was the knight of greece which was destined for to conquer it and said in her
self that she would help him to obtain the same / with that he would take
her to his wife / such^ or semblable were the thoughts of the fair medea at
souper She beheld often times Jason when she saw her time / and it anoyed her
much that she might not speak to him pryuely what shall I say more / for when
the king and the greeks had right well take their refecco^n the tables were take
up / and after the greeks were brought into diverse chambres / and among all
other Jason was loged nygh^ by the fair medea / for there was no more between but
a litil aleye from her chamber to his by which Jason went afterward often times
unto medea

When then^ Jason was withdrawn into his chamber And that he was allone with
Mopsius he began to devise with him and said. Mopsius fair sire ^ what say ye
of myn^ enterprise of Colchos. By my law sire said Mopsius. I see no way ne
know none other thing ^ut matere of dolor and sorrow. for every man ^f this
house Iugeth^ you ded if ye go in this perilous isle of colchos where there ben
so dredeful and terrible bestes as it hath^ ben said to you / Notwithstonding
ansuerde Jason it behooves that I acquit mine auowe. Certes sire said Mopsius
hit is now no need for to go any further if it plese you and be well conceyled
ye ought to be content without going any ferther^ for as it is said conmunly.
hit is better to leave folly. then^e to mayntene folly. Ha a Mopsius said Jason.
if I do not my power to perform that I have promised and auowed / I should use
al my life after in reproach. certes yet had I leu finiss^e my days honorably
/ and know ye verily that syn I am come thus far abiding the grace of the
gods I shall perform mine entreprise and shall abide the adventure / Sire said
mopsius ye shall do that ye good seme^ but ye understand not well your caas /
for know ye that it is al certain that peleus your uncle hath^ sent you hither
cautelously for to enterprise and achieue this adventure to the end that he might
obtain your royame. and therefore ye may return from hens in to great without
more further enterprise / ye shall ge^e thereby no reproach / but ye shall be
holden for wise / for he is discrete that can fle from his mysaue^ture and keep
him from dom^age

IN verite Mopsius fair sire ansuerde then^e Jason. I ne may not adiouste
fayth^ to all that ye have to m^ now said / And for so much know ye for
certain that for paril of deth^ or danger that may befall and come to me / I
shall not deperte me but that I shall furnissh^ mine auowe. and therefore if it so
happen^ that I dye in this perilous isle I require you to recom^ande me unto
the good grace of the fair Mirro When Mopsius had understand that said is / he
began fore to weep. And Jason leyde him doun^ in his bed / and syn^ changed
purpoos. and began to d^uyse of the good chiere that the king Oethes and Medea
had made to him In recom^andyng above all other things the great beauty and
the fair contenau^ce of Medea^ And in continuyng this purpoos he fill a sleep

THe fair Medea was at this time at the door of the chamber of Jason and herd
all the devises of Jason and of Mopsius. as she that was esprised of the love
of the gentle prince of Grece^ that in no wise she might vaynquiss^e her
courage. And also long as their devises dured. so long stood she at the door
herkenyng^ And when they ^^ssed their purpoos she retourn^d into her chamber /
where was but one ancient lady her gardyen^e or maystresse which was tho a
sleep. And then^e the noble maid Medea went and leyde her in her bed full
of thoughts and ymaginacyons / that when she would have slepte she could not
For as much as so many thoughts and ymagynaco^ns assaylled her on all
parties by such faco^n / that she turned her often in yelding many a syghe.
And then^e by forse of a meruayllous enbrasing of love she began to say softly
to her self / Alas mine eyes in what labor have ye ^u^cre me. Certes ye be the
cause and none other that I am not she that was wont to be. For ye have
enuoluped mine heart with an ardant fire of amerous desire. Ha / a what shall
befalle or what shall I mow do being in this pain and sor^we. Certes I can
say no more but of verray necessite I yield me all in the ^uby^^cyon and
servitude of loue^ in his servitude shall I be subgette hit is force. And
wherefore For as much as I am smyten^ to the heart with the great beauty of
Jason the bruyt of all the world. And to my Judgment the glory of Greece. O
meruayllous dart wherewith^ I feel me smyten^ to the heart. Certes mine eyes ye
ben the cause which displeseth^ me. And for what reason. for as much as ye be
coulpable of this folly. how be it^ hit is no folly / hit is. I believe hit not.
hit must be beleuid. for hit is great folly to desire thing that can not be
goten^ / I know verayly that Jason is sore enamoured of a lady in his cou^tray.
And furthermore his courage is garnysshid of a great and meruayllous
constau^ce^ Then^e may it be said that I may not eni^ye him / And by
consequent I may conclude that mine eyes have inclined and submised me unto an
over great folly

HA. a mine eyen^ why replye not ye to this argument See not ye that I do no
thing but think. for the gentil and noble Jason thenketh^ no more on me /
then^e on her that he never saw. Ha / a in what Ieopardye stand I in. For I
may not require Jason of love / for that should redou^de in me great blame / and
I should go again the honor of love / And then^e must hit needs be that I
bleue in all my folly. And also I must doubt hit for two resons. The first is.
for I should be deffamed unto the end of the world ^f hit happend me to
require this kn^ght of love / And the s^conde reason is all euydent. for Jason
without contradiccion goth^ into the isle of colchos^ there where he shall be
anon^ deuowred of the terrible bestes / Ha / a what sorrow and dom^age shall
that be if such a prince should perisshe by such manner for he is the chosen
of all nature / the choice of nobles. and the flour of worship / I have herd
his resons. he had lever dye honorably in accomplisshing his auowe then^e to
Return with rest to greece. A ha what noble and exellent corage^ O how happy
and ewrous should I be and nygh^ to great felicite if I might be callid by him
unto his love / that might he do Ye as me thinketh^ / and how. for to teache and
learn him the Industry and admynistre to him the manner for to conquer the
noble flees of gold. I have all things propices for to bring this conquest
to an end. if I wist that he would take me to his wife I should deliuere them
to him with the better will and gre of mine heart / what shall I do. Alas I
wot neu / And if I did him this auau^cement / and after set naught by me
for the love of his first lady in amors To whom he recom^anded him by Mopsius
as I right now herd / certes I should dye for sorrow. and shall I late him
adventure to furnissh^ his auowe^ and then^e deth^ shall follow. Alas nay. for if
he deyde there^ my deth^ were me right nighe. for asmoche then^e as I love him
better then^e my life / and my heart iugeth^ that this is he for whom the gods
have establisshid this meruaillous adventure in the isle of colchos^ And
furthermore me seems that if I do for him so great a thing as for to save his
lyf^ and that by my moyen he shall come to above of his enterprise honorably.
that for the merit and reward of my benefice he shall be content and joyous to
take me to his wife

MEdea the noble lady with this conclusion fill a sleep and passid the night
til the day came / and the king rose up more erly then^e he was wont to do for
to come to Jason wenyng to let and break his enterprise / how well he went
unto him when he knew that he was risen. And fond Hercules with him. They
entresalewed each other. After they began to devise of the isle of Colchos. And
the king reherced of them that had been in Colchos. and how they had been slain
and deuowred / And after this counceylled Hercules and Jason that they should
in no wise go theder / but what remonstrance he showed hem / Jason abood in his
purpoos for to take thaduenture^ and to put his body in Ieopardye among the
three terrible and crymynel bestes / and concluded that he would depart
thederward with in four days following / When the good king apperceyuid that
there was none other remedy / but that Jason was verily deliberid and concluded
taccomplisshe his auowe upon the right meruaillous adventure of Colchos / he
deported him self from speking more thereof. and conceylled Jason that for to
pass his time he should goo to the temple of the goddess Deane. which the
ladies of Sychye had newly founded in a forest called Edee. Jason thanked him
much of his good conseyl and said that he would go theder with good heart /
and then^e he disposed him to go theder and sent for all the greeks of his
conpanye and took with him the rep^sentacion of the noble goddess pallas
which was in his ship / aftre this he set forth^ his knights on the way /
and him self bering the said rep^sentaco^n went after with them / hercules
and theseus went beside the preu Jason and had tofore hem trompettes / claryons
tabours and other instruments that made so joyous anoise and bruit that they of
the cite had marvel. and some there were that followed them For among all other
medea and her ^uster and other ladies and damoiselles unto the nombrre of
^iij.C. followed and hasted hem so sore / that they were at the temple tofore
the Greeks

When Jason was come to this temple medea came and met with him by the
incitacion and admonesshement of love and entresalewed each other curtoisly /
and there were many of the greeks that beheld medea in making their prayers
Always Jason that thought on nothing but on his deuocions entrid into the
temple. and set the rep^sentaco^n of the gods pallas by and nigh^ the
gods deane. and when he had so don he cast him self down on both h^is knees
to fore the awter / and there was so long in prayers and oroison^s that the
far medea was sore greuid and anoied. for she desired sore to speak with him.
as she that was not come theder only but for to speak with him. and was in all
determined for to save to him his life in p^seruing him from the fire and venym
that the three marvelous bestes cast and rendrid

AT the last Jason arose from his prayers and came to the ladies. to whom he
made reverence and principally to medea / the which aroos against him. whom the
ladies and damoiselles beheld much ententifly / after she took him by the
hand and led him and shewid him all the places of the temple. and among al
other she shewid him there the rep^sentacion of the god mars wenyng for to
speak to him of certain things the which she desired sore to know the troth
But hercules and theseus and other of the greeks ladies and damoiseles followed
so nigh^ that she wist not how thaco^plisshe her entenco^n. how well that she
lad him long / and when she saw that she might not have her intent there / she
said to hercules that she would bring them into the temple of venus Then^e the
preu Jason and Hercules thanked the noble lady of her courtoysye and departed
from the temple of deane for to go to the temple of venus. but in going Medea
began to sigh^e as she that had therte enflam^ed of a meruaillouse ardeur and
bren^yng. and then^e when she could not hyde that lay on her heart / by force
she entemed and began to opene her matter in this wise sayng / Certes right
noble knight I conplayne much your great beauty / wherformadame ansuerd Jason
/ for asmoche said she as I have understand that none may break ne torn you
fro thenterprise that ye have taken but that ye will adventure you in the
conquest of the flees or sheep of gold / which is a thing inpossible to any
man living. and know ye for certain that if ye go theder ye shall neu retorne^
and for asmoch^ as ye be comen of so noble extracco^n of rial lignage / and
that it is so that euy like loueth^ his semblable / by this very and naturel
reason I complain you above all other / me thinketh^ that ye be meruaillously
abused for to so will lose your lyf^ certes I have not herd of a gretter
simplenes / for naturrelly euy creature fleeth^ the death and desireth^ to live
/ it hath^ well ben declared and adutised to you of the parils that been in this
adventure and that for to bring to effect ye shall lose your life / and yet always
ye wole not believe conceyll. Certes Jason it is evil done. and ye do against
nature when ye be cause of your deth^ which every man ought to flee soueraynly

When Jason had understand this that said is / he answerde to the noble lady
in this manner. Madame I have right well understand your words and resons
which ben good and holsom^e / but ye compte not that euy noble body ought
son^er chese the deth^ then^e to ^o ne consent thing that should be against
their honor / hit is well trouth^^ that in the presence of the grettest princes
of greece / I have auowed to bring to end this enterprise / how well that it be
marvelous and doubteuse. shall I then^e go against my word. Certes there ne is
way ne moyen none but that I must needs furnisshe this adventure. or ellis
that I be poynted with the finger a reproach and cowardice. and as a right
recreat knighte By all my gods I had lever tabide this adventure. then^e
fortune should predestyne me to do thing that I might in any manner be
reprehended or reproched

INcontinent as Medea understood the h^e will of Jason she was much joyous /
neutheles she feigned to be dolente and sorrowful. and of fait s^e required
hercules that he would show to him the great paril that he would put him in /
but hercules ansuerde to her that he would rather cou^ceyle Jason to do it
then^e to leave it. for if Jason failed to furnisshe this emprise / that he him
self would take it on hand to bring hit to end. Neutheles said then^e Medea
if Jason believed my cou^ceyll he should go no ferther / And I shall say to him
such reason a part. that me semeth^ he shall believe me. And then^e she drew
Jason a part / and when she saw that they were so fer from the other that
they might not understand what she said. she said to him in this wise In
verite Right noble knight / hit behooves that pitye of a woman must be excused
by your gentilnesse I have pite of you and of your great beauty. and certes
nature hath^ inclined me thereto / And trustyng if I do any thing for you ye will
know it. The hour i^ come that hit behoueth^ that I do appear to your eyes
the secret not only of my herte^ but also that same by the which ye shall
obtain and come above to bring to end your meruaillous enterprise to your
great honor and recom^endacion by the help of the gods And for as much as
if I declare to you by great love things that been high and great / if ye will
further know of them it is of necessite that ye swear to me to keep it secret
above all other things of the world*

MAdame ansuerde then^e Jason / I am a pour and true knight sent unto these
monstres / certes it hath^ plesid you to do me more honor then^e ever it shall
lie in my power to deserve / neutheles when your pyetous heart will incline
unto my pouerte / I swear to you by the names of all the gods that men
worshipe / that if ye declare to me any thing that as long as I shall live it
shall not deperte from my month / By my law sir knight ansuerde medea I have
great confidence in your noblesse^ wherefore I am resolewed for to discouuer to
you the secret of the gods / and after / that lieth^ on my heart / which if
it be not long on you / it shall redou^de to your great honor and prouffit /
Madame ansuerde Jason / it shall not hold on me / and if ye know any thing
propice to my worship I me submit in all unto your right noble g^ce / Ha a
noble knight said then^e medea / I may no longer feign / mine eyes have beholden
your great beauty / ye ben all the desir of mine heart where there werketh^ love
so perfondly that I have great pity of you / and in such wise that if ye will
promise me to be my true husbonde / and brenge me into your country after your
vow and enterprise brought to an end / I shall promise you and also show how
ye shall mow conquer the moton^ or flees of gold without danger of your body
and in such wise as ye shall return hole and sauf to your glory and honor
To the which no mortal man may come but if it be by a secret manner / coming
from the gods. The which not long syn was deliuerid to me by my mother /
wherefore I pray you that ye will have regard to mine offer abandon^ed and also to
your health

When Jason had understand medea thus speak. he began to frown in him self
and sighing with an heavy heart ansuerde. Madame ye constrain me to be
beholden more to you then^e to any creature living. and I can not conceive from
whens this ewr cometh^ when I feel me thus fallen in your grace. and I would it
plesid the gods that I were digne and worthy thereto / and that I neu had made
vow to lady in the world / Certes fair sire said medea / me seems that your
heart hath^ atteyned the mercy of some lady. have ye ensured and wedded her /
Madame ansuerde Jason I certefye you nay. but I have sttte my love in her so
perfaitly that in no manner I may forgete her / and I have promised that I shall
be heeris al my life. Then^e said medea / what some eu be there of / it is of
necessite that ye leave and put her in oublian^ce. and that ye entende to
complayre me if ye will not receive the deth^^ f^r but if ye deporte you fro
your enterprise. wyth^oute mine aid there is no remedy / And if I be cause of
sauacion of your lyf^ as to the regard of me / I will enjoy you allone with
out any other. My dear lady ansuerde then^e Jason the pour abandonned body is
youris. for to honor and serve you in all that in me shall be possible / In good
fayth^ fair sire Jason. if ye will give your self al to me / I shall give my
self to you in like wise

IN verite Jason ansuerde my right dear lady ye do to me right great honor
without deseruyng. Certes sire Jason ansuerde the lady love is cause of this
well and pite hath^ com^anded me to do it. the which cause me to ren^e in so
great a shame as for to require you to be my lord. but it semeth^ to pite that
in favor that I desire to save your life / ye ought to excuse me / Madame
ansuerde Jason I shall neu be so ewrous as to come Justly unto the good grace
of one so noble lady as ye be / and would right well that hit should mow be.
but what shall become and shall mow say she that I have given my self to / if
ye forsake her not. on all parties said then^e medea. I may not help you to do
your conqueste ne save your lyf^ and therefore chese ye^ for I am smyten to the
heart with your love syn that I must say al If I should be cause of saving of
your life / and then^e happend an other should enjoy your person / it should
behoue me to dye for sorrow / And therefore thenke ye what ye have to do and be
ye advised. With these words Jason and medea entrid into the gardyn of
plaisan^ce / in which was set the temple of venus / in such wise aduiron^ed
and set about with flowers and with delicious works that hit seemed a
verray paradys terrestre / Then^e Hercules and the other ladies and damoiselles
approached unto Jason and Medea wherefore it behooved hem to leave and cesse their
parliament / and to behold the plaisan^ce and the delites of that place of
flowers and all the faco^ns of vignes and trees hyly conduyted by compass

When the grekissh^ knights had seen and conceived the beauty of this place^
they had thereof great marvel and were much esbayed and after they entered
into the temple. and there made their orisons and syn beheld the composico^n
and ordonau^ces of the images that rep^sented the amorous people al about the
goddess venus. and when they had long seen and beholden all / Medea took leave
of Jason and said that she would abide a litil while there^ And then^e Jason
departed fro the temple and returned with the greeks unto the palais. and the
fair medea abode in the temple much pensif and in great payn^ in so much that
after the departing of the greeks she knelid down humbly tofore the
rep^sentacion of venus and said in this manner / Right sovereign goddess of
lovers which hold all the faites of nature in thy domynaco^n and seignourie
I yield me unto thy good mercy / Ha a and where may I become for to have good
conceyll / I have required the noble knight Jason of love or at lest I have
reveled and shew^d to him the secret of mine heart and of my thought / and with
that I have offrid to say to him and declare the secret of the gods / have
I done evil / I wot neu / but at lest I apperceyue clearly that I have my
self to him abandon^ed ^ given / Ha a what shame is this / ye verayly and more
if he daigneth^ not to here me / but if I may do somoch^ that he accord unto
my will / this shall be to me the most grettest glory that may come to any woman
of a noble house / ha a right hygh^ gods conceyle me / enseigne and teache me /
put your help to this werk to your ancell or handmaid / it is now time or neu

AFter this orison^ abode there the fair Medea as al rauisshed. and was so long
there til the lady ^ that had her in guard came to her and said that she tarried
and made her prayers to long and that it was time to return to the palace
Then^^ aroos medea from her comtemplacion al esprised of love. as her visage
shewid it plainly. and returned homward And when she was comen to the palais /
she found that the king abode her for to go to dinner. but she gaf the king to
understand that she was not well disposed^ and so the king set him at the
table with Jason / the noble hercules and theseus and caliope the second
daughter. and medea went unto her chamber and many ladies and damoiselles
followed her / how well she made hem al deperte and go out of the chamber. and
retained non^ with her reseruid the lady that had the conduyte and charge of
her^ the which was right sore abasshid of the maintene of medea^ wherefore
incontinent as all the women were withdrawn she came to her and said thus^ My
dear daughter I have great marvel from whens this malady is comen to you. In
good faith ansuerde medea fair moder^ it needs nothing to you to marvel.
for there is no creature what that eu they be / but that they must be subgette
to receive the maladies and sekenes when they come^ and when the gods and
fortune will send th^em / your reason is good said then^e the lady / but when
the maladies ben comen / it behoueth^ to seche remedy as soon as is possible^
and therefore tell ye to me your necessite^ and where the sekenes holdeth^ and
greueth^ you / and I shall adutise the medicine or phisicien that he shall
pou^ueye for remedy / A ha fair mother said Medea Late me in pees It must needs
be that ye tell me answerde the lady / it is aue^ture said medea. wherefore
said the lady For asmoche as mine infirmite is ou secret and for somoche I dar
not discoue it / A ha my dear lady said she then^e / I suppose that hit ben
amourettis. that thus trauaylle you and I am in doubt that the beauty and the
noble virtues of Jason ben cause hereof / for I see you all in other manners
then^e ye were wont to be. And if it be so / tell hit to me hardily. for ye
be the creature above all other of the world that I love best / I have unto
this time / the best wise I coud governed and nourisshid you. and for so much
me semeth^ that ye should hyde no thing from me. and if ye be any thing smi /
ten with the dart of love. discouere it unto me^ that shall be unto your heart
great alegement. for every person amourous passes his payn^ and grief lightly
/ when she finds to whom she may open her heart and devise clearly / My far
mother said then^e Medea I see well that it behooves that ye know all mine
affayre^ certes verily I am amoureuse of Jason. and so much that I should
Ieoparde my life for him^ and in d^de I have required him that he take me to his
wife / ^ I shall deliuere to him the industry and teache him how he shall win the flees of gold and also adau^te the ferdful bestes of the isle of Colchos

When the lady had understand this that said is. she began to weep tenderly
sayng. Ha / a dear daughter what have ye done / I am all dishonored by you /
when ye go prayng the strange knights of love. Ha / a what outrage Certes they
shall mocque you / and if it be known ye shall never be honored ne called as ye
tofore have been. Know ye fair mother ansuerde then^e Medea / that I have not
done so ill as ye wene^ and if I have required the noble knight Iason^ of love
hit shall be reputed to me virtue and not shame ne dishonor / for pity hath^
constrained me so to do / for as much as hit is in me to save his lyf^ and to
make him R etorne with glory and victory of his enterprise / and for so
much know ye that then^e when I have seen so fair and so well adressid knight
that his like shall not be seen in a.M. year / I have had pite of him / and
above this love has made me enterprise that I have required him considered
many things / and that he would neu have required me^ and I have made to him a
promise which I will hold and entretiene / if he will ensure me that I shall be
his wife / for I have here within / by writing the manner how the gods will that
the moton or sheep of gold shall be conquered. wherefore I require and pray you
that ye conceyle me and help that by your con^yng and conduyte I might get
and draw him to my love / and that ye would do somoch for the love of me / that
he have no souenau^ce of any other lady in the world / save only on me. for it
is force that it so be or ellis he be deed and perisshed in the isle of colchos^
where he has auowed to go and finisshe the end of the right perilous adventure
of the moton^ or flees of gold / And finably that in bewailing and bewepyng
his deth^ I be homicide of him and of my self

THen^e the lady seeing Medea to be in this point beheld and saw how she was
of a marvelous and great courage. and yet she thought that there might come
harm of if the maid acomplisshid not pertye of her desire. and syn brought to
her remembran^ce^ that she might bring Jason to conquer the moton^ or flees
of gold / and when she had put al these things in a balan^ce and fiched in
her engyn she began to reconforte medea. and in deed promised her that she
should so do. that wyth^out other moyen she should enjoy the love of Jason /
and it was not long after but that she went to the bed of Jason / and there
made certain coniurisou^s and carectes. for she was all expert in all manners
of enchantemens and of sorceries. and when she had thus done she came again to
Medea / and said to her that she should no more doubt of any thing / for from
after the time that Jason be leyd and couched in his bed he should never love
other woman but her^ and so it befelle / for as soon as Jason was leyd in his
bed at the euen^ all his corag^ and entendement were rauysshed in thinking on
the great beauty of Medea in such faco^n a^ he might in no wise sleep

MOpsius h^dde a custom to speak every night wyth^ Jason. And th^n^e Jason
would speak of the beauty of the noble Queen Myrro / And often times be spack so
much of her that he was we^y / And then^e when this mopsius saw that in this
night he made no menco^n of his lady he was all abasshid and sa^d to him.
Verayly Jason I apperceyue well that your esp^rite is trauailled with new
fantasies / I have seen that ye have pass^d the mos^ part of the night for
tallowe and preyse the beauty of your lady in love the fair myrro / and yet ye
spoke of her the night precedent / But in this night the rewle failleth. Certes
ansuerde Jason yt is expedient that she be put with the sins in oubliance.
for as for Myrro I recche never thaugh^ I never see ne mete with her / But
say to me freely what seems you of Medea. Is she not the passerowte of all
the Ladys of the world^ Is not she the tryumphe of al beaute^ Is there any man
in the world that could or might better wisshe for his recreaco^n / Answer to
me / Sir said mopsius I me accord right well to that ye say touching the
caas of Medea But unto the regard of the fair Mirro that somoche have be
recom^anded in your courage I may not believe that ye have put her in oublian^ce
/ By my law my fair friend said then^e Jason / Who is fer fro the eye. fro the
heart recueleth Myrro is clear as gold / but medea flawmeth^ and shyneth as
the preciouse stone. And if I might find my self in her grace I should love
her souerainly^ A ha said mopsius I held you for the most loyal and most
constant knight that eu gaf him to serve love / and now I apperceyue that ye be
variable as other be^ be ye not remembrid of ysiphile whom ye would neu will to
loue^ and that ye said / if myrro ne had been ye would have espoused her. I am
esbayed of you more then^e of any man / Certes mopsius ansuerde Jason if ye will
do to me any plaisir / speak to me no more of Myrro ne of ysiphile. but of the
fair medea speak long ynowh and largely For this is she that I will keep in my
conceyte and her that I shall serve unto the deth^ / And who that speaks to me
of other shall be mine enemy

When Mopsius had understand the will of Jason he spack no more but slepte. and
Jason abode al pensif on the fair Medea. And medea that herkenyd as she had don
the night tofore went into her chamber anon^ as the parliament of the two
knights was don / and came to her mother all reconforted. and said to her and
recou^ted all that she had herd And syn leyde her in her bed ymagynyng how she
might find her self a part to speak with Jason / and concluded in her self
that she would go on pilgremage unto the temple of the goddess deane. sayng if
that Jason louid her as he had said he would not deporte for nothing but come
after her Thi^ ^^^clusion was not taken without habu^dance of syghes. the ^yght
drew over and the day began to shewe^ and the fair Medea aroos / and made the
noise run that she was hool / and that for the recouurance of her health /
she would goo thank the goddess deane in her temple

After this she atired and arrayed her in the fairest wise she could or mighte^
and in process she put her on the way right nobly accompanied of ladies and
damoys^lles Whereof Jason was right Joyous when he knew h^t / and desired the
way as soon as he might. Certes he followed Medea under the couerture of will to
go by good devotion to the temple O fair couerture the humayne people living at
this day hold the same term in many places. and goon^ to the temples and
chirches or in the holy places ordo^ned to god by devotion for tesface and put
away their sins And yet neuth^les they com^yse there their sins and for to
come to the love of one and other. they go more to the mass for to behold and
look each upon other and for to make their tours and signs then^e for any
devotion. O hygh^ devotion. O right dampened ypocresye. men com^yse sins where
they ought to be in devotion and do virtuous werkes^ they begyle lightly
ynowh^ the world to her charg^ and dampnacion. But certes god in no wise may
(...) abused

FOr then^e to return to our mater^ Jason thus comen to the temple where as
Medea was. first of all ^e made semblau^t for to adoure and worshipe the
gods. and set him down on his knee tofore the auter of the goddesses Pallas
and Deane. but for this time he neither made prayer ne oroison^ / but thought
what manners he might best hold against Medea. And of what purpoos he might
make to her his entree. And when he had long auised him he aroos and took his
way unto Medea which came against him^ But then^e when she saw that he drew
him ^oward her and that they had entersalewed and that Jason had made the
reverence unto the other ladies. Medea entrid subtylly in devises with him.
And in devising of one and other she drew him a litil a part against the awter
of Dyane whom they began to behold / And then^e Jason making manner as he had
spoken of the goddess Dyane and of the rich wood that here and there
aduirronned yt he said to her in this manner. Madame lo here your pour knight
/ I yield me unto your mercy and am ready taccomplisshe all your good
com^andemens. and pray you if I said yesterday any thing that was to your
displaisir that hit would playse you to pardon^e me. And if ye may help and
aid me to bring to a good end my vow and enterprise and socoure me in that
great werk. I swear and promise ^o you in calling to wytnes of mine oth^ the
high goddess Dyane and Pallas. that if it please you to be my dear felaw and
friend. I shall be youres all my life and shall bring you with me into Greece
without making any fawte

Jason Answered then^e Medea I declared to you yesterdaye my caas all privily /
and how I had great pity of you / I know also that the gods have had pite
on you and will not consent that ye should finysshe your days in Colchos. And
that they have inspired you to submit you to my will. for other wise hit
were not possible but that ye should be there ded and lost. therefore for to go
forth and make short / for we may not long hold parliament after your
ordenan^ce and covenant I shall accord me to be your wife. in all such manner
as I promised to you yesterday / And yet I promise you that of your auowe and
enterprise ye shall come to your above / to your honor and prouffit. ye to
morn^ er the even be derk and obscure. then^e it is expedient that ye lie
allone this night in your chamber to the end that I may the better speak to you
and at more leyzer. and to introduce you more secretly into such thingis as
shall behoue you to hold. and speak no more to me of this matter at this present
time that none apperceyue of our enterprise or of our love

With this the noble lady began to show to the noble ^reu Jason the great
richesse of this Representacion of the goddess deane. and Jason allowed hyghly
the king Oetes that so well had don it to be ediffied^ With these words Medea
took leave of Jason and of the other knights of greece which tarried a litill
there and after returned unto the cite. and after she departed from thens /
And there was Jason complained and bewailled of all the people / Sayng one to
another that it was right great dommage of one so gentill a knight and so well
adressid that would goo and do destroy him self in all points in the mortal
adventure of colchos. They spack and said moch^e thing one and other / And in
especial the noble King Oetes the which came to Jason as he departed out of
the temple of the gods deane / and much discou^ceyled him thenterprise of
colchos^ and that for nothing he should descend affermyng to him that he should
lose his life if he entered / and that he that had sent him the der did hit for
to make him dye cautelously

Jason hering the conceill that the king Oetes gaf him for his weel / thinking
how a knight lives in great reprouche when he goth^ against his auowe and
promise And considering the conclusion and promise that he had made with
Medea. abode ferme and stable in his first purpoos Sayng unto the king Oetes
that for death ne for any other paril that might come to him he would not
deporte him but brenge it to an end / and in deed concluded that on the morn^
without any longer tarieng he would make an end thereof / wherefore the king
Oetes demened much great sorow^ and in like wise did all the knights of greece
reseruid hercules and Theseus / and so passid that day speking of this
meruaillous werk unto the even that every man withdrew him unto his place / and
the valiau^t knight Jason took leave of euy man for to withdraw him into his
chamber / and gaf Mopsius to understand / that he would pass that night in
orisons and all devotion and contemplaco^n / and that he would have no man^
with him at that time / whereof diuse had great marvel for asmoche as he had
not be accustomed so to do / and some sai^^ that men should not suffer him to
take so mortal an enterprise^ from whens he sh^lde never return / Considering
the high and recom^anded virtues where with he was endowed

How the promesses between Jason and Medea were rateffied / And how medea
deliuerid to him all the mestier and craft that he ought to have to conquer
the noble moton^ or flees of gold / and how he gate hit

AT the point then^e when the sterres rendrid there clerenes and clarte. and
that the moon began tenlumyne the night / Jason with^drew him into his chamber.
and Medea slept not. she espied and seeing that he was withdrawn al allone as
she had charged him / she opende the door of the steyre by which descended
down from the chamber of Jason into heeris. And callid down Jason which was
right pensif / And when Jason saw the door open^ and Medea that callid him. he
went unto her much ioyously and salewed her^ and after approached to her for
to have kys^e and enbraced her / but Medea said to him that he should cesse.
and taking him by the hand brought him into her chamber where they satte upon
a much rich tapyte / The maistresse of medea came then^e between them / And
when sir was comen Medea began to speak and saye^ Jason my lord and my friend
ye know well the promess^s that been between you and me / I w^ll well that in
the presence of my good ^^der that here is / that we make recognycion and
ratefye them to the end that they be hole and permanent. and after that w^ sh^l
entende to your conquest / And then^e Jason and Medea swore and crean^ced that
they should take each other by marriage. and there made solemn promesses /
whereof Medea was right ioyouse and so also was her maistresse / Then^e medea
opende a coffre which she had made ready where out she drew a sh^rte with the
bille conteynyng thord^nau^ces which were requise and propice for to go into
the isle of colchos to make the conquest of the flees of gold

When Medea had drawn out the lettre. She did it to be read to her friend
Jason / And after she said to him in this manner. Jason my dear friend for to
return hooll and with your worship from the I Will of Colchos. from whens never
man^ returned. hit is of necessite that to fore all other things ye
accomplisshe all tho things that been contained in this writing. which the G^d
Mars sent to the king Appollo^ And for so much first to fore all other thing
ye shall goo unto the temple of the goddess dyane at this hour / And then^e ye
shall adresse you unto the priest. to whom ye shall give fyfty besau^tes for
your offering and demand of him a bulle / of whom ye shall make sacr^fice unto
the god Mars with this sherte with which the king Appollo was clad when this
writing was deliuerid to him ^ and ye must put in your box the blood of
this bulle with part of the asshen of your sacrefice / and with this blood and
assh^^ ye shall enoynte there all your body. and this shall preserve you from
fire and venym of the right meruaillous bestes. After of the residue of these
ashes ye shall dele them in two parties. whereof that ene part ye shall keep
clean and pure^ And ye shall meddle that other with glue in a bo^e which I shall
give you. And this glewe shall serve for to dompte the two horrible bulls /
This done ye shall take the Arms of the king Appollo which ben on that one
side of the awter of the god Mars. And ye shall adoube you with them. And
then^e when ye have accomplisshed all thise things / ye shall return hither
again to me / And I shall furnysshe you of the residue of that shall be behouefull
to bring your conqueste to an end

CErtes the preu Jason was moch^ esmeruailled then^e when he understood the
high mysteres that him behooved to make for to come to above of his conqueste.
and when he had herd thensignements of Medea. he thanked her often times. And
then^e took the bille. the sherte. the box with glewe and that which was
necessary to him And syn departed from thens secretly / and went him in to
the forest where as was the temple of the goddess deane. And did so much
that he came to the temple where he found the priest slepyng wherefore he awaked
him / Then^e the priest demanded him what he was and what he sought Sire
ansuerde then^e Jason / I am a knight that come hither for to sacrefie unto the
god Mars. I pray you that ye would deliuere me incontinent a bulle with the
fire and I shall give you for mine offering fyfty besan^ts / When the priest had
understand Jason / that he promised so good an offrande / he rose up hastily /
And in like wise done all the priests and curates at this day when they feel
and understand that there shall a good offrand come to their singular prouffit
anon they put their hand to the cause. Then^e when this master priest was
risen he came to fore Jason and did him great reverence / and after said to
him that diligently he should be seruid of all that he demanded^ as he did. for
he p^pared and made ready the fire and bulle which he brought into the temple^
Then^e the noble Jason maad his oroison unto god mars and unto god Appollo. he
took after this the bulle and made his sacrefice and put the shert therto^ and
when al was turned into ashes he distribued it into three pertyes. one part
with the blood of the bull which he retained and enointed his body with al
by the pressed / The second pertye he medlid with the glewe that was in the box
And the third part he put in a litil sack of sylk which he reseruid and
kept clean

THese things done and accomplisshed as said is / Jason knelid down and made
his prayers the second time And when he had made all his deuocions / he
deliuerid to the priest fyfty besau^tes that he had promised to him. and with
that he presented and gaf him a rich mantel of cloth of gold which he
brought with him. and made the priest to a doube him with the arms of god
Appollo which was there. promising him to bring them again / and when the
p^eest had armed Jason at all points / Jason recom^anded him unto god mars /
and Appollo / and to the goddesses / dyane / pallas and venus. and syn took
leave of the priest and did somoch that he returned secretly into his chamber /
by the which he descended into the chamber of medea whom he fond sleping When
Jason saw Medea in this point / and also saw her maistres a sleep / he was
terribly esprised with lou^ and chauffid in somoche that the blood began to
boylle in his body. and his heart began to desire so sore and in such faco^n
that he approchid to Medea and kysshed her mouth. but with the kysshing she
awoke. And had much great Joy then^e when she had seen and espied him so
armed wyth^ the Arms of the king Appollo^ Then^e Iason^ made the reverence to
Medea and after said to her in this manner / Madame I have don all that ye have
enseigned me also nigh^e as I might. and am enoynted with the blood of the
bulle of whom I have made sacrefice to the gods / and lo here the glue medlid
with a part of the ashes / com^ande me now that shall plese you what I shall
do / and speed you for it is nygh^e day My friend ansuerde Medea welcome be
the day / and anon^ with the aid of the gods ye shall get the grettest
glory that eu knight living gate. And know ye in the recom^endacion of you
and great preysing hit shall be spoken of unto the end of the world

WIth thise words she took a vestyment which was rich and gaf it to him
sayng / My fair love ye be pourueyed of all that is behouefull for you so that
ye have this vestyment upon your arms / see that ye work freely and
corag^ously with this that ye haue^ ye must be pourueyed with hardynesse and
valian^ce. keep well^ your bill^ / and be dilig^nt to do and accomplisshe all that (...) cont^eneth. and by the playsir of the gods / I shall have you here
at euen^ with more gretter consolacion. Then^e Jason clad him above his harnoys
with the propre ves^yment that appollo was cladd at the hour when he receyuyd
the bille a fore said With that the day apperid fair and cl^re / wh^^fore Ias^n
took leave of Medea which was al (...) with love / At leave taking they kyssed
each other man^ (...). Fynably Medea conveyed Jason unto his chamber door / and
their began there amorouse b^isiers and kyssinges unto the time that it was
force that medea must withdraw her / and then^e she recom^anded Jason in the
guard of the gods / and shette fast the door. It was not long after that
Mopsius and Hercules came and knokked at the chamber door of Jason. And with
them the good knight Theseus and many other all of Gre^e / wh^iche salewed
Jason and gafe him the good morrow / but when they espied that he was tho armed
and in point. they were much esbayed. and would hau^ axed of him who had so
armed him and. adowbed. But the king Oethes and other of his knigh^tes came also
to him and salewed Jason. And the king seeing Jason in point. took the words
and said / A ha s^re knight what will ye do / ye seek your destruccyon / when
so erly ye begyn^ to put you forth^ / I conceyle you that ye deporte you of
this enterprise And I declare you ellis homycide of your self. For he is of him
self homicide / that knows his death in a place and voluntarily ^e put him
self therein. Sire king ansuerd then^e Iason^ I confess that ye conceyle me
Right wisely But n^utheles in hope for to live I have well entenco^n to achieue
mine enterprise without longer delay / I thank you of the great honor that
ye have made me unto this time Mopsius took the word and said

CErtes Jason fa^r s^re I have this night had a meruaillous vysion / the which
conforteth me in yowre victory. For me seemed in my first dreme / that I saw a
sperhauke^ the which sechyng his pray / put him self among many other
terrible birds and of strange nature / the which in a litill while he had all
oucome and put to death / and so I compare tho same birds terrible and of
strange nature unto the two bulls and to the serpent being in the I Will of
Colchos^ which every night cast fire and fumyer. and as touching the
sperhauke^ I understand you that seching his pray / that is to say your
adventure on this day / by the aid of the Goddes^ ye shall be made vaynqueure
of the horrible monstres and possessour of Right gloriouse Renom^ce

When Jason had vnderstonden this that said is He ansuerde to Mopsius sayng.
Certes fair s^re the gods shall do their will of me. And if hit be their
good playsir^ your vysion shall be holden for certain a prophecye And wyth^
that he adressid his words to Hercules and said. My loyall^ brother and
welbelouid felawe^ make good chere and pray for me. I have no manner doubtance
that I ne shall soupe at even with you^ and that I shall affranchyse you of
your vow semblable to myn^ / with thise words many began^ to weep. Then^e
the noble preu Jason took leave of one and other / And syn required of the king
that he might go unto the ladies and damoyselles. The king did do assemble
them. And when they were comen in to the hall he brought Jason which made to
them the reverence and principally to Medea and Caliope / and syn recom^anded
him unto their prayers / and when he had done this by space of time he put him
unto the way unto the Ryuage of the sea / where his master maron^er was /
that abode and awayted upon him in a litill bote that he had made ready the day
to fore^ Into the which he entrid / and in recom^anding him self to all the
world. he departed from the port for to descend into the isle of Colchos

THis morenyng was fair and clear / and clean from all clouds. And the son
casted his clear rays and bemes upon the erthe^ The ladies and Damoyselles
mounted and went upon the high stages of the palace. And the bourgeyses and
merchants wyth^ the com^yn people of the cite ran^ some to the creueaulx and
batillements of the walls / and other to the Ryuage of the sea for to behold
the adventure of the noble knight of greece / Jason that Ioyously went with
Argos his master maronner that brough^te him into a righ^t good entree of the
marvelous isle adressid him and set foot a ground upon the grauell^ And took
his glewe and his ashes and entrid into the isle by great desire and
hardynesse^ And he had not far goon^ when he espied the rich moton^ or sheep
of gold which was so resplendisan^t that it rejoiced all the isle / After he
espied the two bulls lepyng out of their holes. so great. so dredefull. so
righ^t fires and hidouse / that only for to look on them it was ynough^ for to
lose wit and understanding / and when he had well beholden them. He knelid
doun^ on the erth^ against the eest where he saw a temple al of gold of the
gretnes of.xvj. foot in eight squares founded on.viij small pylers / thretty
foot of heyght^ in the mids where of was an awter upon which was an image
rep^senting the god Mars

THen^e there Iason^ worsh^ipped the god Mars^ and there was in contemplacion
unto the time he saw the cruel and terrible dragon^ spring out of the temple
/ For he was great as an horse / And was thretty foot long the wh^iche
incontinent as soon as he was out of the temple he began to reyse his neck /
set up his eeris. stracch^e him self Opende his throat and cast out brennyng
flawme and smoke by a meruaillous voyding wh^iche deperted out of his stomach.
Then^e saw Jason al these.iij^ bestes with whom he must have to do. he took
and beheld his bille for to know what he had to do. he found that first he
must adau^te the two bulls. wherefore he aroos from his contemplaco^n and made
ready the box with glue. After he marched promptly in great hardynes toward
the two bulls which beheld him right fiersly and asprely with her eyes
sparkkyng and brennyng as fire grekyssh^. And they began to desgorge fire and
flambe out of their throtes against the knight so des mesurably that all the
Regyon of the air and all the country seemed brenne with wild and grekyssh^
fyre^ But this notwithstanding they might never travail ne do harm unto the
noble preu Iason^ But he by great hardines approached by the fire the flambe and
venym that they casted And did so much that enoynted the mosels of both two
And cast into their throtes the glewe that was myxed and medlid with ashes
which he brought with him as said is. But as soon as thise bulls felt the
glewe and ^endres to gyder medlid certes they closed their throtes and mosels
in such wise as they might n^u open^ after ne cast more fyre^ whereof the
noble knight was so Joyous as he might be seeing thexperiment to be of so h^gh^
recom^endaco^n Then^e he thought on Medea and said well in him self that she
had deliuerid to him a good and verray socours ^ for certain he had lost his
life in this adventure ne had she have been

AFter this consideracion Incontinent as the no^le preu Jason apperceyuyd that
these two meruaillous bulls were oucomen and adau^ted / then^e he beheld the
contenu of his byll / and fond that then^e him behooved anon to go fight
against the meruaillous dragon and terrible without comparison^ / Then^e he
drew out his good sword of the shethe and went unto the temple where the
dragon held him / anon as the monstre had apperceyued Jason he enfelon^ed him
self / and by great Ire opend his throat right terrible in gretnes out of whom
sprang out three tongues castyng fire flambe and venym in such wise that the
good knight had al his body aduiron^ed there with / how well that the fire ne
the vemym had no power upon him. but passed by Jason like as hit had be the
clerenes of the son^e. and he came and gaf the monstre so great a stroke with
his sword between the two eyes that he made his heed hurtle against his crowpe
right sore and durely / And when the dragon felt this streok / he releuyd him
self and syn opende again his throat and disgorged upon Jason a fumee so thikke
of venym that the noble knight saw nothing about him^ but this not
withstonding he hau^ced his sword and discharged hit upon the dragon where he
thought his head was / and smote so well the monstre that he cut of his three
tongues even by the mosel as nigh as they might be. whereof the serpent felt so
meruaillouse pa^ne and dolor that he began to frote and rub his head. And
turned on that one side so suddenly. that with his taill he smote the valiau^t
knight on the back that he fill doun^ on the sand

When Jason felt him so smyten doun^ to the earth he was so sore astonyed that
he wist not what was befalle him / And with this he had great shame / He
Releued him and stood up anon^. but at his releuyng the fumee of the dragon^
was vanisshed / and in seeing about him he apperceyuyd the three tongues of the
serpent which he had smyten of and syn he beheld the dragon which froted
his mosell on an herb / and then^e he ran^ upon him agayn^ and smote in the
mids of the taill. in exploiting the most part of al his strength^ and also
his trenchan^t sword in such^ manner / that he cut of a piece which was
seven foot long Then^e the dragon^ by the great payn^ that he felt hau^ced his
heed and came right fiersly and recou^tred Jason wyth^ all his pesau^teur and
might. in such a faco^n that Jason was beten doun^ to the ground. And the
dragon passed over him. But then^e the preu Jason took his swerd and roof into
the paunche of the dragon up to the cross and smote him to the heart / and the
dragon feling that he was smyten to the death began to run with the sword of
Jason in his body wenyng to hyde him self in his cauerne. But his life departed
out of the body even as he should have entrid into the temple / And there he
ouerthrewe all to stracched and fowlid of his blood and of his humeurs full of
venym In such wise as hit seemed that hit had been a sourse or a spring rennyng
out of his body longer then^e a great hour

INcontinent that Jason was releued and that he apperceyued the dragon reuersed
and deed at th^ntre of the temple / with an heart recomforted he went theder
and drew out his sword of his body / and put him agyn in his shethe or
skabarde / and then^e he went and seized the bulls by the horns / and yoked
them in a plowe that there was by And made them to ere four mesures of land.
enclosing their eyen^. And then^e when he had so done he returned to the
dragon and esrachd out of his heed.xij. teth^ / after that he sowed them in
the earth that he plowed^ and that done he did the bulls do harowe hit. And
then^e the bulls fill doun^ to the earth and lost the spyrite of life / and
out of the land that Jason had sowen^ with the teth^ of the dragon^ grew and
sprang up in an instant.xij. geants of a terrible maintene^ the wh^iche were al
armed after the manner at that time / And as soon as they were comen out of the
earth drew their swerdes and without delayng came and supposed to have smyten
upon Jason / but Jason took the cendres or ashes pure that he had kept of his
sacrefice. and cast it into the air. and then^e suddenly tho same.xij. Geants
assailled that one that other by such asprete and sharpness that in a litil
while each slew other^ whereof Jason was right joyous and rendrid thankinges and
louynges to the gods

When these ^xij. geants had slain each other. as I have reherced unto you
Jason drew out his swerd which was yet all blody. and came to the Rich moton
or sheep whom he found in the right noble medowe. and took him by the horns
and brough^ him into the temple tofore the awter of the god mars. And there he
slew him with much great payne^ and syn flew him and took the fl^es that had
the wolle all of fyn gold and leyd hit a part And the body he dispieced by
members. and bare it up on an awter wh^iche stood without the temple^ and put
thereto largely straw and dry wode / And when he had don this he took fire at
a lamp brennyng to fore the representacion of god Mars / And syn knelid down
on his knees on the earth by devotion tofore the ydole sayng the oroison^
tofore wreton^. after the contenu. whereof he thanked the god mars And
Recom^anded him much into his grace / After this he put fire into the
sacrefice which anon was consumed and turned into cendres or ashes / This
done he put him self to prayer. and after he took the three tongues of the
meruaillous dragon^. two of the feet of the bulls which were of metal of
laton / And two of their horns which were of yron^. and enuolupped and
wrapped it all in the flees of gold. which he charged and leyde it on his
sholdres And afterward he returned unto the Ryuage of the sea where his master
maron^er named argos which had guided his boot over the braas or arm of the sea as said is had abyden there in much great doubt

ARgos the good shipman^ was sore abasshid of that That Jason was so long
there^ er he returned to him and thought for tabyde no longer / for he had seen
the fire and the fumee great and thikke lift up into the air. And also he had
seen many evil apparances / voyses. and right strange bruyts / for which
causes he supposed that his master Jason had been devoured of the terrible
bestes / And began to weep and bewail him right tenderly. but incontinent when
he espied the vaillyau^t knight Jason with the flees of gold on his neck. his
teres and wepinges cessed. For sorow^ craynte / and doubt departed from his
heart / and all Joy aduiron^ed him in such manner. that smylyng he knelid
doun^ on his knee to fore him and sayde^ Sire knight myrrour of all vailliau^ce
and of all enterprise / ye be right well retou^ned. Ha / a what consolacion and
gladness shall be in Myr^^done and with my lord your fader Men have murmured
upon Peleus your uncle. and every man said. that he had sent you hither for to
be quite of you. thinkyng that ye should never have returned. but to that I can
apperceyue^ he desireth^ above all other thing your glory and honor. Certes
Argos fair sire answered then^e Jason / Fortune hath^ so much aid and helped
me / that I am returned hoole of body and of members fro the most terrible^
dangerous / and mortal parill that ever shall befalle and come upon the earth
during the world. whereof I yield louinges and thankynges unto the god Mars
pryncypally^ but now late us think to return unto our felawes For it is more
then^e time to ete

WYth^ these words the good shipman began to row with a franck courage. And
the Greeks that were standing upon the Ryuage of the sea began then^e a great
stryf. For som^e said that Jason was reentred in to the barque^ and that they
had seen the resplendisshour of the noble flees of gold / which wa^ with
great pain creable for as much as from this Ryuage unto the isle of colchos
was four good miles. And the other said. that Jason was long agon^ deed. and
that he should never be seen. but thus as each man was susteynyng his argument^
therewith was the boot seen^ approchyng much radely the Ryuage / And was
about a mile nygh^ to the port / Jason took his flees and lift hit up a
lytil in the air. ye as hygh^ as he might And held hit so hye / that they
that were at the Ryuage and on the walls of the Cite beheld hit and
apperceyued hit and showed hit one to an other by great admyracion and wo^dre

MAny there were that demened great Joy and thanked the gods with good
heart when they had perceyuid the noble and rich flees. whereof the preu Jason
made the mustre fro far / and some ran^ for to gadre of the grene herbs and
verdure for to cast a long on the way where as Jason should pass for to goo
to the palais sayng to every man that they were certain of his retournyng / and
that all honor ough^t to be maad to him for one so noble and gloriouse
conqueste / Medea among all other was so righ^t Joyous when she espied the
ligh^t and shynyng of the flees of gold that her seemed that she should enter in
to a paradyse terrestre. And com^anded that her ladies and Damoiselles should
put on the fair front in entencion to make feste solemn for the honor of
this righ^t exellent victory. and f^r to come to a conclusion. trompes
tabours. menestrels. horns sarasinois and business began to blow up and sown
melodiously after that time used / The maron^er Argos Rowed in such wise that
he brough^t Jason to the port hooll and sauf^ where he was fested of the king
Oetes / of the worthy Hercules^ and of theseus. and generally of all the
Greeks. Hercules took the rich flees when Jason was descended upon the land /
and bare hit tofore the valian^t knigh^t Jason which went first into the
temple of the goddess deane. and there thanked much hygh^ely the god mars /
and the goddesses pallas and Deane. After he made him to be disarmed And there
he yielded again the arms of the god Appollo^ and syn made his oblacion of one
of the feet of the bulle^ and of one of their horns with one of the tongues of
the dragon. and when he had done all this solempnly. he returned to the
palais where he was Righ^t honorably receyuid of Medea above all other and of
her Ladies and Damoiselles which beheld Jason meruaillously. and in especial
the noble and rich flees of gold which hercules bare ^n hye tofore him

CErtes there is noman so eloquent ne so well can^ endyte by writing that could
descriue to you how great playsir the eyes of the preu Jason and the eyes of
the fair Medea took on then^e when they began to behold each other / And all
the world there demened Joy and gladness / And when Jason was goon up in to
the halle. Hercules set the noble flees of gold upon a cupberd richely
arrayed. And anon^ after the knights / ladies and damoyselles began the dau^ces
/ and the feste was fair and great unto the hour of the souper that the tables
were couerd and that the king and Jason was set. and with them the noble
lady Medea / hercules Theseus and mopsius^ At this table was Jason and Medea
set one tofore that other. but in no wise they durst not speak one word / how
well they made many s^crete signs of love that could not be apperceyued / but
they entremarched with their feet under the table^ whiles that Jason reherced
in groos the great parils where he had been ynne. without making of any
menco^n of ordenaunces m^ners and cerimonyes that he had holden

OF this meruaillouse adventure were the king Oetes / Hercules and the other
Barons knights and noble men^ that satte and seruid at this soper much
abasshid and greatly meruaylled. And how the noble preu Jason was escap^d of so
great and perilous adventure / And hyely recom^ended this enterprise and
vailliau^ce. Hercules and Theseus that a fore time had slayn^ many monstres /
confessed there that all their fayttes passed were nothing to the regard of the
adventure that Jason had enterprised and brought to an end What shall we make
long compte this souper passed^ and the hour came that the king Oetes and
Jason withdrewe hem into her chambres / And then^e was Jason conveyed into his
chamber with many noble men one and other. and theder was brough^t the noble
and rich flees of golden but at this time they migh^t not devise ne play
there as they had been acustomed / but sent hem in to her chambres and mopsius
with the other sayng that all that night he would wake in oroisons and prayers
unto the gods for asmoche as they had done to him so great aid comfort and
honor in his works

Anon then^e as the preu Jason was left in his chamber as said is / the
maistresse of medea came and opend the door of the chamber. and demanded Iason^
if he would come unto her daughter / Jason ansuerde ye with Right good will /
Th^n^e he went doun^ into the chamber of his lady which had made ready a right
fair baygne^ Then^e he salewed her and after said to her in this manner / My
dear lady know ye that I have had much great desire to see you secretly and
in our pryuaulte. for to thank you of the right great honor that by your
cause is comen to me / and also of the mortal paril and danger that ye have
deliuerid me fro / wherefore I thank you right humbly of al thise benefetes /
and furthermore I present you the body that ye have preserved fro deth^. Ready
to obey all your com^andements and playsirs / Certes Jason my dear love and
friend ansuerde the fair Medea^ if your desire have been great and such as ye
say yet has mine be more as I wene. I have done the best that in me hath^ be
possible. and I have right great Joy and gladness of the knowleche that ye
have. All my courage is nothing save to playse yow^ ye be right welcome and
with great worship returned for you and for me / And make good chiere hardyly
I have ordained for you a bayne for to wassh^ you from the blood wherewith ye
have been enoynted / and therefore dispoylle you and enter in to this bath^ / and
then^e we shall devise at our leyser of all your works

When the preu Jason had understand this that said is he did of his clothes
right glad of this adventure and syn entered into the baygne / and the fair
Medea in her corse^t which had no sleues terned up her smock sleues and in
this point came and froted and weesshed her friend Jason. And then^e when the
gentil bacheler apperceyuid so gentil corpse and body of Medea^ her fair and
ronde tetes the whitenes of her flessh^. And that he felt her hands
meruaillously soft / him seemed that his heart and his body slew He was so
much esprised of an ardant desir of love. he began then^e tenbrase the lady by
the body / and syn beheld her great beauty / and thus doing he kysshed her
many times. And then^e when he had been well eased and washed Medea made him to
lie in her bed beholding his members well formed shapen and made and his color
fair and quik. and could not turn her sight from him. They were thus
beholding and auysing each other with out sayng any word. But at last the
noble preu Jason took the word and said. My dear lady. ye know well how I
have promised to be your husbond / and also in like wise ye have promised to be
my wife / then^e may I say I am youres and ye ar myn^ / and of us two is but
one thing / then^e I require you so affectuelly as I can or may^ and for all
the plaisir that ye may do to me. that ye will come and lie by me here in your
bed / A ha Jason ansuerde then^e Medea / for gods sake save myn^ honor.
Madame ansuerde Jason. there is no man in the world that shall keep it more
then^e I shall I am your husbonde. and if ye come and lie in your bed by me ye
do nothing but honor / My dear friend said medea^ there is no plaisir but that
I shall gladly do to you / but for this night ye shall have patience of your
request. and I pray you that to morn^ be time ye desire of my fader the king
that he would give me to you in marriage. and then^e do ye your deuoir. and if
he be content we shall make our weddyng and spousailles here within honorably.
and if he will not / I somone you here to morn at night at h^ure acustomed /
and know ye for certain that I shall do all that ye will^ com^ande me to do as
reason is. for I am bounden thereto by virtue of the promesses made between you
and me / And allewaye I recommande to you mine honor

When Jason had understand the good will of medea. he said in his courage
that she had wisely answered / And that he was content for tobeye to her
request What shall I say more the night drew over in such^ terms as said is.
how well Jason lay there til it was day And on the morn when he was Risen and
saw his time he made his Request unto the noble king Oetes that he would give
his daughter Medea to him in marriage / but he found the king Oetes triste and
much pens^f and al other wise then^e he was acustomed to be. and made him an
answer in this manner / Jason ye bear with you out of my dominacion the most
rich tresour that is in all the world Which greuith^ me greatly. And if I
had known that I now know / ye had not comen in time thereto / and now ye
demand me my daughter Medea which is most con^yng and the most dear thing
that I have. Suffice you with that ye have. And never speak to me more thereof
also dear as ye have your life. Wyth^ these or semblable words the king Oetes
went on oo part. And the noble preu Jason went on an other side much
abashed of the fires and hard answer of the king Oetes. Hercules / Theseus.
and Mopsius came then^e unto Jason. which told them how he had been with the
king Oetes. and how he had required to have to his wife his daughter Medea. and
how the king had ansuerd him fiersly / But when they had understood all this
/ they concluded among the^ that they would depart from thens on the morn^^
After this done they went and took leave of the king and thanked him of the
great honor that hit had plesid him to do to Jason / And after they went and
vysited their ship. and passid this day with litill plaisir. for the king
Oetes made hem no chere / This notwithstanding when the night was come Jason
went unto the fair Medea and told to her how he had made his Request^ to the
king Oetes her fader. And how he had answered to the regard of their marriage.
And how he was departed from him. Whereof the fair Medea was meruaillously
soroufull and sore troubled thinkyng on many things. But when she had well
bethought her considering her cas and her affayre / she made right good chere
to Jason as she that abandon^ed her all unto his playsir. And so it is to be
supposed that this nigh^t they lay to geder^ and more say I not for this
present as towching their faytes of love

IN this nigh^t the fair medea took all the most richest Jewels and bagnes
portatif that the king oetes her fader had / And she put and trussed them in
a sardell / And when hit came a litill to fore day she made Jason to Rise.
which was anon^ ready. And then^e when she was all ready she took with her all
the richesses / and also her young brother absirthius of the aage of.xvj.
months / whom she took secretly in a chamber from the nourice And made her
maistresse to cut his throat pryuely for cer^^yn causes which shall here
after be declared / After this the fair Medea and her maistresse. cladd hem and
disguised them in man's habyte. And by the noble preu Jason they were brought
unto the shippe^ And as soon as Jason had deliuerid them in guard unto master
maron^er Argos, he returned into his chamber til it was day abiding his
felawship Hercules / Theseus Mopsius and many other knights that came with him
at the blowyng of an horn^^ And with that he took his flee^ of gold and said
to them that he would depart from thens with all diligence for certain causes /
And without more sayng at this time he took his way to the end that the other
knights of Greece should follow. And went so far that he entrid in to his
ship so well at point that all his men entrid with him / And then^e the
maronners disancred and began to row by force of oores for as much as hit
blewe not / and the wind helped hem not be cause hit was calm. And thus in
this point they put them on the way unto the son Rising. And at that
propre hour when they were not withdrawn past a mile from the port / hit
happend by adventure that Argos the master maronner began to look toward the
port. and he saw that on all^ sides it was full of people. After this he saw
anon and apperceyued that four litill ships at faco^n of balingers or
Galeyes subtill^ departed to gydre from the port from whens they came. whereof
the good patron Argos had much great meruaille. And he wiste not what to
thenke. he was so emcombred. For he had well^ seen that when the Noble preu
Jason and his company entrid into his ship / that the king / his baron^s ne
the ladies had not conveyed him He had great marvel. but he said not one word

How the king Oetes fader of Medea advertised of the departing of Jason and of
his daughter Medea followed And how Medea cast her brother Absirthius by pieces
in to the sea doubting her fader the king Oetes / And how the noble Queen
ysiphile fill down from an hygh^ montayn^ into the sea
WHo that demands of thise four litill galeyes subtle for what cause they
moved fro the poort. And what people were there inn / the history answerth^ /
that their entencion was to come after the knights of greece And the king
Oetes was in one of them accompanied of four honderd men / which were all
bourgeyses of the toun^ that he had made to be armed^ For as much as he was
acertayned that his daughter Medea was goon^ with Jason / and I shall tell
you how. This king Oetes as said is had been soroufull and anoyed all the day
precedent fond him self so full of melancolye that he coud not sleep ne reste^
Allewaye after many thoughts and precogitacions he concluded in him self that
he would goo and conueye Jason at his departing to this end / that he comen in
to Greece should preyse him and saye^ that he had made him good chere / For to
bring to an end this conclusion / he aroos and willing to enter fro chamber
to chamber til he came to Jason. he entrid in to the chamber of the nourice of
his sone Absirthius / whom he fond not wyth^ his norice that slepte / whereof he
was sore abasshid and awaked the nourice. And after demanded her. where was his
dear sone Absirthius / And then^e the nourice began to look about her / But
that was for naught for she fond him not. wherefore all effrayed she sprang
out of her bed and began to seche him dyligently all aboutes. And the king
Oetes entered in to the chamber of Medra / and there he fond no person ne his
daughter ne her that had governed her long time

When the king Oetes fond not his daughter Medea he was so angry that his blood
changed^ and wyth^oute spekyng any word / he went up into the chamber where
the noble Jason was logged / but he fond neither Jason ne Medea ne person to
whom he might speak / and for so much he departed suddenly and went unto the
port where he fond many of his citezeyns that showed him the ship where the
greeks were in / which was at that time from the port more then^e a quater of
a mile / Then^e the king weping tenderly demanded them if they had seen his
daughter medea. And they ansuerde nay. A ha fair sirs said then^e the king. the
traitres of greece have withdrawn her with words traitorously in somoche as
they have deceived her and brought her into their ship / and yet that more is
have so evil cou^ceyled her that she hath^ born^ with her my sone absirthius.
O evil daughter. O the evil fortuned child Certes medea thy great disloyaulte
constraineth^ me that with force of people I will goo incontinent fecche the for
to wete who hath^ meuyd the thus to do. and with this I shall take vengean^ce
of the desloyal knight Jason which to his power rendreth^ to me evil for good

When the king had said thus he returned into his palais cryeng that euy man
should arm him / And then^e all the people pourueyed them of staves and
armures* and syn demanded whereof proceeded the cause of this alarom^e / the
which anon^ was all com^une / Then^e they put them on the way for to go unto
the king. which came and issued out of his palais armed and in point for tentre
into bataill. Then^e he went unto the port and chese out four honderd of the
best in point for to put into the said four galeyes / And fynably when he had
done all this he meuyd fro the por^te as said is / and with all haste made his
galeyes to be rowed after the knights of greece / in such wise as the master
maronner apperceyued that tho galeyes came swiftely after them for to fecche
again the fair Medea^ and called Jason that Iaped and played with medea /
p^sent his felawe hercules. and shewid to him the four galeyes armed where in
was the king Oetes and his men well in point which approached fast / For the
galeyes were light^ and Jason seeing his encombrance approach / called Hercules
which knew nothing hereof and demanded him cou^ceyll Then^e Hercules ansuerde
to him that he knew none other remedy but that every man should put him to
arms and be ready tabyde the battle if hit were nede^ And auowed unto the
gods that if the king Oetes made any enterprise upon them that he would put
to deth^ as many as he might a^eche

With thise words and with out longer tarieng the noble knight Hercules and
Jason put them in arms. and in like wise did their felawes / Then^e Medea
and her maistresse sprang upon the plank of the ship for to behold the king
and his galeyes / And anon after Jason and Hercules all in arms came up on hye
by Medea and each with a sword in his fyste. And Medea began to tremble for
fere. when she had espied her fader to approach so nygh. at the end the king
Oetes poursiewed so sore the ship of the noble preu Jason by force of oores /
that er they were out of the goulf or braas of the sea / that there was no more
distance fro on to an other but two bow shote Then^e the fair Medea seeing that
it was time to bring to end that she had begon^e tofore^ said to her
maistres in weeping tenderly / My good mother where is my litil brother absirthyus
/ give him to me / Then^e the evil old woman opend her lap and vnwonde the
body of the child. whom she had smiten into pieces / Medea took the heed and
lift it an high whereof hercules / Jason / and other seeing this had great
horror of this cruelte and were sore abashed. neutheles when the preu Jason
apperceyuyd this he would know fro whens came this creature so deed. and said
to medea in this manner / My dear love what have ye in your though^t / and what
will ye don with this so malerous and pyteus child

MY dear love ansuerde then^e Medea / Thexperience of my work enseigneth^ to
you the thought of my heart Madame ansuerde then^e the noble preu Jason. what
is this child that I see here thus detrenched and smyten in pieces / certes he
is in an euill^ hour born^ / that thus myserably hath^ finisshed his days. My
dear love ansuerde then^e the fair Medea. this is Absirthius my young brother.
know ye that he is not malerouse / but is ewrous and happy / for this day he
shall be cause of the sauacion of the life of his fader and of his m^n. and
then^e he is much ewrous and in a good our born^. when he in his tender
yongth may be cause of the health of so much people and specially of his fader
naturel. Certes Medea said then^e Jason / I see none other faco^n ne moyen but
that ye be of all points dishonored when ye have com^ysed so right pyetous a
caas. as for to have murdrid ^our propre brother innocent of all thinges^ A ha
what horrible cruelte. My dear love ansuerde then^e Medea ne troble you other
wise then^e by reason. For if it be your plaisir ye shall here what I shall say /
and after of the caas I mak^ you judge. ye know how I am by you brought from the
house of my fader against his will^ I have considerid what my depertyng is / and
furthermore I have thought and have had regard unto the great and marvelous
courage of my fader. and al thing ou thought and considerid that I could not
withdraw me fer but he should be adutised / for he hath^ of custom that every
morenyng. er he goo doun^ he will see his sone and me also^ I have ymagined that
anon^ as he findeth^ not me nor his sone / that without fawte he will come
after me in Arms like as ye see he doth^ / and thus when I have all these
things considered and the great danger that might ensiewe to us that for me
should be the bataylle mortal between you and him in which without Remedy he
should be slayn^ or taken by his hye williau^ce seen that unto deth^ he would
abandonne him self for to recouere me. and to the end teschewe more great
parill and dommage for him. I have taken his owen sone / which is my brother
and have com^anded to put him in the state as ye see for to cast at this time
abroad in to the course of the sea here and there. And to give empechement unto
the ship of my fader. which then^e shall tarry whan^ he shall see his sone
Absirthius thus desmembrid flotyng upon the water for to gadre and recuyelle
the pieces / as ye shall seen plainly anon^

WIth thachieuement of these devises the king Oetes approached in such manner
the ship of the Greeks that there was no more distance but a stone caste^
Then^e the fair Medea and the old woman^ filled there hands with the membris
of the noble child Absirthius in showing them to the king Oetes and his men^.
For as soon a^ the old Queen espied the king she escried these words following
and said thus / King in no wise come no nere wenyng to recouure thy sone ne thy
daughter / As to the regard of thy daughter. thou losest thy time. for she is
married unto Jason. But at l^st we shall render to the thy sone slain and
detrenched by pieces / the which we cast into the sea to the end that thou
may have thy life saved. for but if he caused the to have occupacion for to
recuyelle his propre members for to do burye them as hit apperteyneth^ to the
sone of a king. know thou that thou sholdest have the bataill against the
knights of Greece which ben of so hye valian^ces. that there ne is anymal
monstre serpent. ne tyran^t but that they bring to destruction / then^e it
ough^t to be bileuyd / that the victory of the bataill should abide with them.
and certes thou sholdest receive thy death So all thing well ouerseen hit is
better to the that thou return unto thy cite then^e tapproche more ner for to
Receive thy deth^^ And well ought thou to have great joy for to see thy
happy sone be ded and detrenchid by pieces By the which thy life is respyted.
for thou art not very ne naturell fader if thou take not his members out of the
see^ and if thou so do thy life shall be saved and all they of thy company

With these words the old woman and Medea cast in the sea the members of
the young child Absirthius / And the king Oetes and his people heering and seeing
the great inhumanyte and cruelte began to escrie righ^t pietously and
dolourously / And were so sore vexed and trobled of this meruaillous adventure.
that they wist not what to do. some there were that began to weep tenderly / the
other smote them self on the breasts / and some began to array hem to goo to
bataille and escried to deth^ the knights of greece shoting on them arowes and
other trait by great courage for tauenge them / but when the king saw that in
no wise he might recouure the death of his dear sone^ he made to cesse the
esca^musshe and said to his Cytezeyns. Certes fair sires I pray you to travail
you no more for to recouure Medea / she hath^ murdrid her propre brother
Absirthius / which was my sone / and he that in time to come should have been
your naturell lord / Certes I have louid with all my heart her all her life
that with her desloyall will has brought to me one so dolourouse guerdon^ or
reward. Ha a Medea said the king all on hygh^ I shall never seche ne desire
to mete with the for cause of so cruel and disnaturell a deed / that thou
have com^ysed to thy propre blood / And therefore fair lords late her and all
them that been with her goo where the gods will suffer hem. But know ye for
certayn^ that if I now had her at my liberte I should make her to deye a
cruel deth^. how well that should sourdre thereof to me a new sorrow wh^rfore
it is better that she goo / and that we entende to reassemble the members of my
sone which floten as ye may see upon the wawes of the sea to the end that his
flessh^ be not pasture to the birds

When then^e the nobles and bourgeyses of the Cite understood their king / all
they began to seche the members of Absirthius in demenyng the most great sorrow
of the world. And thus they dysposed them to complayre the king and no more
tassaile their enemies. And when they had fysshed the members of the child they
returned unto the cite by space of time right sorrowful and disconforted for
the deth^ of Absirthius / And for as much as Medea also was goon^ with Jason.
Medea was then^e well Joyous and more assured then^e tofore / when she
apperceyuid that her fader and his men tarried for to fysshe the members of his
sone. Certes Jason seeing this that said is wist not what to think / And Argos
the good maronner rowed alleway in withdrawyng from the port and the I Will of
Colchos as much as he might in so much that in a litill while he had lost
the sight of the king Oetes and of his galeyes. and that he came into the hyhe
see. where the wynd blewe and aroose that anon^ they desployed their saylle
which they wonde up an hygh^e. wherefore the ship made good way. whereof Argos
was much Joyous / and then^e he said that every man might leye doun^ his
harnoys freely promising them to be out of all parils for that time^ Jason at
this time was right pensif for the cruelte and inhumanyte that he had seen this
day and spack not one word / and seemed by comparison^ more triste then^e
Joyous and not with out cause. When Medea had understand that Argos assewrid
all the company for that time from all parils that they had been in / was thoo
comforted greatly. but she beheld her hands that yet were all foul of the
blood of her brother Absirthius. she went and washed hem and made hem clean
/ and after she came and set her doun^ by Jason / And seeing that he was much
pensif. said to him by a gracious and curtays manere^ My dear love whereon
think you / Certes Jason answerde not one word. And when she saw that / She
said to him again the same words / My dear love Jason whereon think you /
Then^e Jason ansuerde to her thus / lady syn that ye desire to know whereon I
thinke^ know ye for troth that if it were not for the great love that I have
in you and for that I have promised to wed you and bring you into greece. I
would not do it / wherefore keep from hensforward that ye do no such thing as
dear as ye will have pres between you and me / Upon thise words Medea excused
her the fairest wise she could and was to her possible Sayng that all this that
she had don was of very good will in somoche as she so doing supposed not to
have used cruelte ne humanyte ne of hayne or hate p^cedent / and that in the
night tofore the goddess deane had showed and made Reuelacion to her that king
Oetes must needs deye or Absirthius his sone for him / And by such words in
coloring her caas she traueyled so sore that she found her self in the good
grace of Jason

DVring this voyage when they had been certain days on the see^ mopsius came on
a time to Jason and then^e brought to his remembran^ce how he had promised to
ysiphile to return by the cite of len^os. upon which Jason ansuerde that he
said troth / And that he would hold his prom^sse. So he spack to hercules. to
theseus and to the master Argos which were glad hopyng to make good chiere
in that cite. but when Medea knew that Jason had promised and would go theder
for to see the queen ysiphile as him behooved. she and her maistresse ordained
their sorts and their enchantements in a secret place which were of such
virtue. that when Argos wend to take his way by an arm of the sea which
gooth^ strait to len^os. his gounaile brack in more then^e a thousand pieces /
and by a wind much subtle the ship was incontinent turned and brought all in
thopposite to thentenco^n of the noble knight and his company. wherefore all
they that were in the ship were right soroufull reseru^^ Medea and her old
maystresse which were at their ease

THe Queen Ysiphile was upon an hygh^ roche being upon the sea side not far
from Le^nos at the point when the nobl^ preu Jason passed forth^by as said is /
and she was acustomed daily to hold her and awayte there right sore desiring to
see Jason on whom was all her thought and desir. And somoche loved him that
she bewailed him from the morn^ unto the even upon this roche and said often
times thise propre words that follow. Ha / a Neptunus god of the sea and of
the winds where is my dear love Jason Bring him again to me. Render him again
to her that day and night wepeth and sygheth^ after him ded or a live I will
have him / And I pray you that ye will send me this grace and ewer lever this
day then^e to morn^ / Thus then^e as she was all dyscomforted one day among
all other she looked into the sea toward the eest. and saw from far the ship
much desired that saylled by a great radour and a full saill where Jason was
in / Certes she knew yt anon^ as well by the gretenes as by the baners and
enseignes that were displayed with the wind. whereof she had so great
gladness that she began to make the best chere of the world. But as she was
thus rauisshed in great Joy and that her seemed that Jason came seuerly unto
her^ With that the old maystresse and the fa^r Medea put their sorceries to
work and their enchantements. whereof thauenture of the ship sorted as said
is^ For she turned al suddenly at that other cost / whereof the pour Ysiphile
was all abashed and sore esmayed. Instead to make Joy she was constrained to
weep great teeres / And instead of syngyng she was enforced to complain What
shall I say More^ as sodeinly as the ship turned / so suddenly changed the
manner of ysiphile. she abode there and passed that night / and did do make
fires and ligh^t of many fagots for to redress Jason and Argos to herward.
thinkyng that without fault Jason would come unto her. And she abode in this
place by the space of six wekes / weeping. wakyng and continuelly bewailing
Jason whom she louyd more then^e her propre heart

When the six wekes were past and that the fair ysiphile apperceyuid that she
should have no tydinges of her love Jason / for thenchantementes of medea and of
her maistresse made that the ship of Jason might not approach the isle of
lennos. The righ^t discomforted ysiphyle seeing that said is^ as upon the point
as full of despayr She departed from the roche. where she had been long abydyng
/ and in a meruaillous appinyon she returned to len^os And then^e when she was
entered into her chamber she made her sone to be brough^t to her whom she kyssed
many times for the love of Jason. and after began to think and contrepeyse in
her mind in dyuce manners / and then^e when she had long though^t by great
habondan^ce of melancolye / she said in beholding her child and crossing her
arms with a sighe coming from the botom of her heart / Alas my dear sone Alas
that thou can not speak for to demand me tidinges of thy fader. wh^iche is
the most fair knight the most vertuous^ and the most valian^t in arms that the
gods eu fourmed. If thou coudest speak and demand me of him I might well
answer to the / but how / Alas I wot neuer^ for at al adventure he daigneth^
not to come / and at adventure when he weneth^ to come as that other day. me
seemed when I knew his ship / whom the wind and tempest constrained to
return and to saylle all at thopposite in showing me his back / and in
traversing the wawes and flotes of the sea so impeutously that I think better
that he is perisshed then^e not^ For in forty days that I have syn soiourned
on the roche / I ne could never see him again. whereof I am Right displaisant in
my heart

MY dear sone then^e where is now nature which should enseigne the to weep /
and me more then^e the / after the loss of one so desired prince. ought I more
desire to live. what may it auaylle me to live / Certes if I should live. my
life should be from hens forth^ full of continuell bewaillinges / of dolours /
of wepinges / and of sighs / O what sorow^ I wot no more to say / I have so
much loved Jason that perdurably I am constrained to weep after him / how be
it alleway the creatures ne desire to live but for to enjoy the worldly
plaisau^ces / and then^e when all mondayn plaisir failleth^. what ought I
desire / Is this a lyf^ Certes nay And what then^e / hit is a life that liueth^
deyeng. and a deth^ that liueth^ in languisshinge. O meruaillous and Right
terryble desire. I shall deye verayly in this Iourneye. hit is concluded. For
what som^e ever shall or may come thereof / I shall spring in to the high see
/ to thend that if the noble preu Jason be there buried. that I may be wyth^
him in sepulture. And to thend also / that if he be not ded. that the sea that
brought him hither a live may bring me to him a live or deed. but first er I
com^yse this meruaillous and dolorous caas. I shall compyle an epistle which
shall be sewed unto my vestyments or clothes. To this entencion. that if Jason
live yet I have an hope that the gods shall do me be presented tofore him.
and then^e by this mine epistle he shall know of what exellent love and courage
I have loved him

MAny ladies and damoiselles were in the company of ysiphile then^e when she
had thus bewailled her dear love Jason. And also the conclusion as she that
was desperate should lepe and spring into the sea. All^ they began to demene
great sorrow meruaillously and not with out cause. Som^e there were that were
July sorrowful that they could not speak o word / other were there drowned in
teeris / that enforced hem to recomforte her / and for to let and distourne
her fro this dampnable will^ but that was for naught. for they lost her pain
/ for as much as ysiphyle wrote her epistle wh^che she wrapped in a cered
cloth and syn sewed hit unto her robe of cloth of gold which she clad her
with / and when she had so do. she took her crown and set it on her head
fermely. and after took her scepter / And then^e when she had done all this.
she came to her sone and kissed him many times and recom^anded him unto the
ladies and Damoiselles / And at last when she had taken leave of all the women^
she deperted from Lennos the cite weeping tenderly / and took with her one of
her damoiselles by whom were known afterward all her bewailingis. lam^ntaco^ns
and all her manners that she held tofore she cast her self into the sea

When she was comen nygh^ unto the sea / she approached unto an hye roche to
whom the sea touched beneth^ a far low doun^ / she began to behold a low
and see the sea And after she stra^^hed her self on the earth in beholding the
heaven and the sea / and said / Very god lord of the sea. of winds / of
tourbillons and of fortunes / of raynes and of tempests / ye brought into this
country and into this place the right parfayt knight. in beauty / in valiance^
and in all virtues Jason / and after ye sent him into colchos / and
consequently ye have shewid me from far his ship. and syn ye have d^owned him
/ or at least lad him into an other country. and when it is so that I may by no
way have non^ other thing of him / I you require that ye will make my
sepulture by him if he have made the passage out of this world / and if he be
on live that ye will^ conduyte me into his presence / for hit must needs be.
and other thing I demand not of you And when the Queen Ysiphile had said
thise words she returned her unto the cite and said in this manner al en hygh^
and clear voys

ADieu my dear child / adieu lennos the noble cite^ adieu ladies and
damoiselles. And syn she returned her unto the see^ And cryeng / Iason^ Jason /
she sprang fro the som^et or top of the roche into the hygh^ see. And there
drowned her self in sorrow. whereof was great pity / But her fortune was such
that on that same day the sea bare the body unto the ship of the noble preu
Jason abydyng yet in the sea in a Rood. where they were ancred for to rest
there that night / At this our when the pour Ysiphile was cast against the
ship. Hercules and Jason went up on hygh^ for to take the air. Then^e
they apperceyued the desolate body so richely arayd that the cloth^ of gold
shone by the disgorgements of the watre. anon as they had seen this they called
Argos their master maron^er and showed to him. Anon argos callid some of his
folk and made them to fisshe and draw out of the sea and to bring in to the
ship that pour creature habilled with Ryall atours And when she was drawn on
hygh^ all they in the ship went up for to see the body of this noble lady /
and medea failled not to come with the other for to behold this pity Certes
the deed lady had her visage swollen and pale that none in the ship knew her /
but at the coming and for the presence of the old woman she voyded blood by
the conduyte of her mouth as hit had been a litill rennyng water departing from
a fontayne or a spring / whereof all they had great marvel

When Argos the good maron^er saw the meruaylle he* stouped down for to put
upon her Roobe a clothe for to keep it from the fowling of the blood that
departed from her mouth^ And as he put the cloth about her neck he apperceyued
the cered cloth^ that kept the watre from the pistle that she had compiled /
wherefore for to know what it was he distached or ripte it of and deliuyd hit to
Jason Then^e the knigh^t received the cloth^ and opende hit and found the
epistle / and disployed it and as he Red it and understood the contenu of the
same his blood began to change and he wax read as a rose / and after becam
pale and deed as ashes And syn began to weep and to demene a sorrow much
aygre and sharp / Certes the fair Medea. Hercules / and Theseus and the other
knights of greece were sore abasshid so were Argos and the maron^ers when they
apperceyuid that Jason demened so great a duyel and sorow^ Then^e it was
demanded from whens this sorrow came and what tydinges he found and had by the
contenu of the lettre / but hit was for naught For he might not speak ner
answer his heart was so closid and strained with anguissh^ and sorrow /
notwithstonding when he had redd it and seen the contenu of the pistle / He
deliuid it to medea and the conteynyng thereof was this that foloweth^

Jason / Jason the chosen of greece in prowess. in beauty. and in virtues where
art thou^ and when shall thou hold thy promise unto her that always hath^ her
eyes planted on the sea after the. des^ring to see again the body by amorouse
desires and by moo bewaillings than the heaven conteyneth sterres^ A ha my dear
love / have thou put in no re^ching ner no challoir the promise that thou me
made at that time when thou wentest to Colchos / know not thou well that
every man of noble name or vocaco^n is holden and bounden to pay and hold his
promise. upon pain of Reproach. Thou have promised to me / the day of thy
promise is passed / thou acquitest the not. O so grievous a shame and large
reproach / ye if thou have not lauful excusaco^n Syn the day of thy promise
exspired / I neu entrid into house for to take plaisir ne to cover me to be
dry. I have not leyd on bed to take my rest. I have not seten at table for to
ete. Ne I have not ben in pretoire for to judge the causes of my women^. but I
have by the space of.xl. days awaited upon a roch^ where I was when thou
entredest into my royaume. And that famyne constrained the to take londe^ There
have I hold me day and night / in the rayn^^ in the wind. in the cold of
the moon and in the heete of the son / In fastinges / in prayers and orisons.
in souffrages. in thoughts. in Imaginacions / in desirs. in hope / and fynably
in despayr and in deth^ anguisshous / For when I have apperceyuid that thou
camst not again to me. in forty days after the day of thy promys. all
dispayred I have compiled and wreton this epistle with my hand and with thyn
/ and all in such wise and faco^n as she that might no longer abide thy coming
and return. I have cast my self into the sea prayng the gods. that they
bring me quyk or ded into that place there thou art quik or ded. by great
deffaulte of thy promise. and to that end that thou see what terryble
affeccion and love I have had to (...) person

IN redyng this epistle^ the preu Jason wept so pietously that he might no
more. And as to the Regard of Hercules Theseus and Mops^us they faylled not to
be of the lyuerey of Jason. And when Medea had red all the contenu of the
pistle. Jason began to complain this so miserable lady that was ded by his
cause as she declared in her epistle / And then^e when he had complained and
bewaylled her long / he excused him tofore them all of the promise that he had
made to her for to return by the cite of Lennos / Sayng that it was not his
defaute / but that the God of wind was culpable^ And thereof he took witness of
hercules th^seus and Mopsius^ Argos the good / maron^er and of many other /
the which knew right well how he had purposed to have gon^ into len^os in
retorning from his enterprise from colchos for to see this noble lady and how
the^ tourbillon^s of wind had destourned hem against his will. but fynably when
Medea apperceyued the manner of Jason She began to demand him^ what prouffited
him his wepinges and such excusacions and syn said to him / Certes Jason me
semeth^ that ye have better the courage of a woman then^e of a man / and that is
no need to weep ne so bewaille a lady that was so despaired. but righ^t well for
your honor and for the goodness that she hath^ done for you and in compassion
of noblesse / ye shall do her to be adouled for to bring her in to your country
and there ye shall do her richely and honorably be put in sepulture as in such
a caas apperteyneth^

BY the words and remonstran^ces of the fair Medea / the duiel and sorrow of
her love Jason cessed a litill and a litil / And Medea with her maistresse
when they saw her time took the body of the Queen ysiphile and leyde it a
part with the atours riall What shall I make long process on the morn^ Jason
com^anded to disancre from thens And was syn saillyng certain iourneyes on the sea / but in the end without making menco^n of any adventure digne of memoire^
Argos the good maistre saylled so far by gouffces and by flotes that at the
twentyest moneth^ after their deperting of mirmydone. he arrived at the port
from whens he was departid. for whose coming the dwellars and inhabytants of
that country of greece were as Ioyouse as they might be^ and on that other side
Jason and all they of his ship incontinent as they had espied and known that
it was the port that they were deperted from began to singe al on hygh^ in
preysing and thanking the gods of that. that they were comen home and had
escaped so many dangiers and parils to their worship and prouffit with right
great tryumphe of vyctorie

AT that time when argos arrived in this poort / the sterres apperid largely on
the heaven / the night was fair and the sea paysible / And therefore the knights
of Greece abode in the ship al night without going a land. and on the morn^
betime Jason sent Theseus for to signefie his coming unto Peleus^ Theseus went
and fond peleus in a cite named Elsebee. where he was merry and passed the time
with his wife whose name was Cypriant / and supposed never to have herd
tidinges of Jason / and when peleus saw and knew theseus he went against him and
made to him great Reverence and worship / and syn demanded him of all tidinges.
Then^e Theseus began to tell a part of the tidinges of Jason. and in especial
recounted to him thauenture that he had done in colchos / and how he had
brought the rich and noble flees of gold And that he was arrived at the port
of sese^re. and that he had with him the flees which was the most fair and
the most noble Iewell^ that ever was seen / and after told him that he had
conquered in his vyage the gre^test honor that ever knight might get. and
also he told how he brought with him the daughter of the king of Colchos
which was most wise^ fair / and exellente. which in all qualitees after
reson^ might be holden for the best accomplisshid lady of the worlde^ The noble
knight peleus hering thise tidings thus told. was so pressid at the heart /
that all the blood changed by all the veins of his body^ how well he made
semblant as he had been meruaillously Joyous. for he sent unto the king Eson
for to show to him these good tydinges. and syn assembled the nobles / the
bourgeys / the merchants / the ladies and damoiselles of the cite. and brought
them in fair ordenan^ce for to mete with Jason

When the coming of Jason was known in the cite and in the country / each man
began to make great chiere At coming out of the ship / Jason and Hercules
were the first that issued out. and after them came Mopsius and an other knight
of Greece. which bare tofore Jason the rich flees of gold in sign of
tryumphe and of victory / The three tongues of the meruaillous dragon / the
legs and horns of the two dredefull bulls. and they led by the arm the
noble lady Medea / which was richely arrayed and fair as the fair day / and
after them followed the other knights and noble men of Grece^ Incontinent as
Peleus and the gentill men of his route saw the noble ^lees that was so rich.
And the great beauty of Medea / they were all ameruailed / they made to them
the Reverence first / And with great honor and glory they brought Jason to
elsebee the cite where they soiourned that mgh^t / and on the morn they
departed thens and went to pintaquo where the king Eson soiourned at that
time. for asmoch^ as that place was set in a good air / and all about had
great deduyt of chaas and hou^ting meruaillously of venerie

Pyntaquo was a fair strong castle standing upon a great River and broad
which ran^ swiftly round about the place^ and wyth^ this hit was enuiron^ed
with fair and parfou^de forestes^ of good land erable and fair meadows
plente. Certes the good king was much reioyed and not with out cause when he
apperceyued and saw his noble sone Jason and the fair Medea his lady. the rich
flees of gold. the three tongues of the meruayllous dragon / and the horns and
legs of the two meruayllouse bulls / for to content each man^ when he had
made the reverence unto the king his fader and to the other nobles / he
declared all plainly in the halle / that he had never comen to the chief of
this conqueste. ne had been the cou^ceyll. the aid and adresse of Medea which
was there present / and therefore said he. I have renonced the love of my lady
Mirro / and have promised to this lady that she shall be my wife and felaw / and
thus I will espouse and wed her at the third day. wherefore I pray all noble men
and other. ladies and Damoyselles. that each person do to her honor as it
apperteyneth^ to do unto a noble lady

When Peleus had understood that the fair Medea had been cause that Jason was
comen to the above of his enterprise with^out danger of deth^^ and that
without the aid of her he had been devoured / he changed color and becam all
deed. and as well advised said naught thereto / but always for to hold Jason in
love he said to him / that he would take the charge for to prepare all that
should be propice and necessary for to make the fest / and furthermore he would
send for to pray his parentis and friends for to be thereat / Among thise
things the preu Jason sent Theseus and Mopsius unto the port of descire and
charged them expressly / that they should ^ go and bury with all solempnite
and Reverence the body of the noble Queen ysiphile / The two knights went
with good heart And acquitted them of this charge For tabregge the history
Cypryane had in guard the fair Medea unto the day that Jason had set for
tespouse her. Castor / polus and Nestor with many rich Dukes came then^e to
Pyntaquo What shall I make long resersaill Jason espowsed the fair Medea after
the law that time used in Greece with much great honor and Reverence. For he
did to her asmoche great honor as lady might receive / The feste was noble
and fair. and hit was full and plenteuously seruid of all things / But of the
metes and entremetes and with how many course and how many disshes at every
course there were seruid I will make no mention at this time^ But thus much
will I say that peleus Cypriane and her daughters made righ^t great pompes /
and Peleus ordained this feste much sumptuous and costlewe of Rich metes and
beuurages or drinks. The day passed and the feste in dau^ces / carolles and
esbatements / the even came and after the night that Jason and Medea lay to
geder. Always this feste endured ^xv. days hole / And during this feste / the
noble and rich flees of gold was ordynatly hanged up in the hall in the
sight of all the world. and there might come euy man that would to behold
hit by great admyracion. And there came people fro far and nigh^ in such
multitude that hit seemed a very procession. for which cause Jason was
meruaillously reno^med in many a country for his hygh^ vasselage and for this
so glorious conqueste

AT the end of ^xv. days and of the hye solempnite of these espousailles as the
noble princes barons and noble men were upon the point for to return to their
countrees Jason and hercules assembled them and ^^ere recounted to them the
^idesse that the king Laomedon^ had done to Jason and to the knights of this
company / in reffusing to them fressh^ water and vytayll for their money / For
the which cause they had been in danger and paril of deth^ / Then^e the Princes
and Barons of Greece hering the great dolean^^ of Jason and Hercules^ promised
prestly and swore that th^^ would avenge this defaulte and miurie / They were
aspre / hoo^ and hasty in vengeance / And after these couenaunte^ thus made /
they gaf charge to Argos to make and sett^ up an honderd ships of war for
to bring fyfty thousand men^ to fore Troy / or at lest forty thousand /
Argos that was well connyng in that work enterprised the charge / And promised
that with in three year all thise ships should be ready to help hem. And when
they had take a conclusion upon all thise things / And that they had made
to Medea all the honor and Reverence of the world / by space of time they
departed all thens / And every man returned into his contre leuing Jason and
Medea in their rest

PEleus went unto Elsebee and bare dueyll and Rancour in his courage more
then^e need was / for so much as he saw Jason so tryumphe / and that he knew
not how he might make him to deye / And Jason which intended to nothing
saving to make his plaisir / let him yet govern his Royaume. and so acquitte
him in the de^te of marriage against the fair Medea in such faco^n. that she
conceyuid of him a right fair sone / which at the end of.ix. months was
deliuerid^ And was named Jason after h^^ ^ader / The king Oetes fader of Medea
came then^e to Pintaquo wyth^ a prive meyne and litill company. as he that
loved Medea like as the fader loueth^ the child^. And when he understood and
knew the great honor that the preu Jason had done to her. he was content with
him and with hi^ daughter / And without exploitityng of any other t^ing he
returned into his country much Joyous. And hit was not long after these
things thus befallen / that the old maystresse of Medea departed out of this
world and deyde. But when it came unto the article of death she taught Medea a
great part ^f the art of nygromancye and of many other sciences where in she
was expert / And also she taught her among other sciences an art and craft
for to make old people to become young of the age of^ xxxij year. But the life
and destynee for to deye might not be lengthid unto su^he persons by the virtue
of the science ne other wise^ for asmoche as it is predestinaco^n naturell

How Medea changed the king Eson into young aage And of the deth^ of Peleus
After the deth^ of the maistresse of the fair Medea Jason demanded Medea /
what she thought best to do She answerde to him / that she had lost great
felawship and priuaulte by the deth^ of her maistresse. To whom the noble preu
Jason ansuerde and said. that there was nothing so certain for every creature
as the deth^. And that the gods would take her soul. After many days Medea
took head that among all other sciences she had one for to make old people to
become young and specially men. And Syn she beheld also that the good king Eson
was passing an^cient and old. for which cause she considered that she might
get a great loos and an hye Renomm^^. if she renewed his aage / wherefore she
called on a day her lord Jason and said to him that by her sciences she could
do somoche that his fader Eson should retouure new yongth in such wise as he
should seem non older but.xxxij^ year old / when Jason understood this that
said is he was meruaillously abasshid and not without cause / but how well
that him seemed a thing inpossible whereto he gaf no faith yet he ansuerde and
said to her / Certes fair lady I know for troth that ye are right wise and
well experimented in plente of hy^ sciences / ye can much mere then^e all other
ladies and damoiselles / but yet this seems a much and a great thing to do so
as ye say to me^ and I would it plesed the Gods now that your science might
s^ra^^he into so bye a matere for somoche as that should be to me a right great
well. for I would that my fader might live so long that (...) should put me in
my sepulture without a^^egyng or shorting of my time. ye know well that euy man
desires to l^u^

By all my gods sire ansuerde the lady ye shall well know that for nothing I
will abuse ne deceive you But I declare you for troth. that for to length the
life of your fader the king l^nger then^e the gods and nature has ordained
by limitacion of time / as touching that I will not touch / for my science may
not furnissh that. But as to the regard for to reduce hi^ yongth^ in such
wise as he shall seem to you and all other in the aage of.xxxij. year I will make
me strong so to do if it be your plaisir and his Madame ansuerde then^e Jason
I am as for my self more then^e content / and pray you thereof with all my
heart / but we must go unto the king my fader and declare to him all the
fayte for to here his oppynion. With these words Jason brought the fair Medea
unto the king Eson his fader. And declared to him the good will that Medea had
toward him. Sayng that if he would consent thereto and aid him self that she
should make him young again and bring him from his old age unto the aage
of.xxxij. year But as to the regard of the lengthing of your life other wise
then^e god and nature has ordained / as to that she will nothing touch

When the noble and ancient king Eson had understand th^s that said is he
being set upon a touch / and resting his heed upon his arm which was white
and lulled he said unto Medea / My fair daughter ye have been cause as I
understand that Jason my sone is comen to his honor and prouffit and to his
above of his enterprise / and that without your cou^ceyle / moyen and aid he
had been deed and devoured by the dredeful and horrible bestes that kept the
noble and rich moton^ or sheep of gold in the isle of Colchos. and as ye have
kept and saved his lif in his young aage flourisshing in virtues and valeur /
will ye also save myn^ in my last days. For certes after the course of nature I
am at the brinke of my pit or sepulture. and thus liyng a long time in the
vmbre or shadow of deth^. I had lever to be and dwell in the world then^e to
part out thereof / for there is no thing that I desire somoche / when it shall be
to you possible as for to return me into the prosperity of iongthe / and
therefore my Syn she beheld also that the good king Eson was passing an^cient
and old. for which cause she considered that she migh^t get a great loos and
an hye Renommee. if she renewed his aage / wherefore she called on a day her
lord Jason and said to him that by her sciences she could do somoche that his
fader Eson should recouure new yongth^ in such wise as he should seem non
older but.xxxij^ year old / when Jason understood this that said is he was
meruaillously abasshid and not without cause / but how well that him seemed a
thing inpossible whereto he gaf no faith^ yet he ansuerde and said to her /
Certes fair lady I know for troth that ye are right wise and well experimented
in plente of hy^ sciences / ye can much more then^e all other ladies and
damoiselles / but yet this seems a much and a great thing to do so as ye say
to me^ and I would it plesed the Gods now that your science might stracche
into so hye a matere for somoche as that should be to me a right great well.
for I would that my fader might live so long that he should put me in my
sepulture without abregyng or shorting of my time. ye know well that euy man
desires to live

By all my gods sire ansu^^de the lady ye shall well know that for nothing I
will abuse ne deceive you But I declare you for trouth^. that for to length
the life of your ^^der the king longer then^e the gods and nature hath^
ordained by limitacion of time / as touching that I will not touch / for my
science may not furnissh that. But as to the regard for to reduce his yongth^
in such wise as he shall seem to you and all other in the aage of.xxxij. year I
will make me strong so to do if it be your plaisir and his Madame ansuerde
then^e Jason I am as for my self more then^e content / and pray you thereof with
all my heart / but we must go unto the king my fader and declare to him all

Medea unto the king Eson his fader. And declared to him the good will that
Medea had toward him. Sayng that if he would consent thereto and aid him self
that she should make him young again and bring him from his old age unto the
aage of.xxxij. year But as to the regard of the lengthing of your life other
wise then^e god and nature has ordained / as to that she will nothing touch

When the noble and ancient king Eson had understand this that said is he
being set upon a touch / and resting his heed upon his arm which was white
and balled he said unto Medea / My fair daughter ye have been cause as I
understand that Jason my sone is comen to his honor and prouffit and to his

had been deed and devoured by the dredeful and horrible bestes that kept the

am at the brinke of my pit or sepulture. and thus liyng a long time in the
vmbre or shadow of deth^. I had lever to be and dwell in the world then^e to
part out thereof / for there is no thing that I desire somoche / when it shall be
to you possible as for to return me into the prosperity of iongthe / and
therefore my fair doughter^ if hit be in you or in your science to do this that
ye have put in terms by your moeuing and after by your word. I should be
greatly holden unto you. and if yt plese you to take the crown of my royame. I
shall give hit unto you. without ^laymyng it eu after. My dear fader ansuerde
medea it is well known that ye ar an hye prince garnisshed with good reno^me.
of noble conusacion digne to bear the crown. wherefore as Reason is your dygnyte
shall abide with you all your lyff / and in favor of your seignoureuse
gentilnesse. ye yet er.ix. days ben past I shall renew you as said is unto the
aage of ^xxxij. year. and I shall not labor on non^ other matter unto the time
that I am come to the above of mine enterprise / which is no litil thing

Without making of any delay the fair medea took leave of her lord Jason
for.viij. days hole / and then^e she deperted fro the palais / and went the
most secretly that she could all all one unto a great wode / And when the night
was comen^ and that the moon shone brigh^t and clear / she knelid down thries
on her knees / studyeng at each time her science / syn lift up her visage unto
the heaven and made this oroison that follows / Moan reposing in the mids of
the sterres that shinest and confermest the charms and ye the gods of
montaignes. of the valeyes. of wodes / of deserts. of the fontaynes / of sees
/ of herbs / and of trees / beye in my beginning and give me aid in my work
for the salute and health of king Eson^ when she had said this she made
certain signs about her / and after she maad som^e s^crete Inuocacions. And
then^e she was lift up into the air and born^ into all the Regyons of the
world Where she gadred and took many herbs of dyuce faco^ns and conditions /
and many precious stones. And was thus in point labouring^ by the space
of.viij. days. And on the.ix. day she was resta^lisshid in the same wood and
in the propre place from whens she was lift up in to the air / And there she
fond her silf tofore a much ric^e temple that was there dedyed unto the
goddess Hebe and to the goddess H^kates

HIt was on the point of the day erly when Medea fond her self tofore the
temple. And then^e Medea abode there all rauisshed unto the son^e rising. and
then^e she entrid into the temple and made sacrefice unto the goddesses hebe
and hekates. hebe was callid goddess of yongth and hekates of charmerye / When
she had done thus she issued cu^e of the temple / and did make a picte in the
earth and in this pit which was deep she sacrefied a black sheep unto the
gods of hell. of whom she held and kept the blood and medlid it with the
herbs. And after that she was garnysshid of all that was needful for her /
returned unto the old ancient king Eson. And did do make for him a fair bayne
/ wherein she put these herbs / and milk and honey And when she had prepared
and made ready all that was for him ne^essarie In the presence of Jason she put
the king into the bayne where the herbs begon^e to smell right sweet And ever
more and more gaf good odor. And anon^ after that he was therin^ and that she
had rubbed and froted him with the herbs / he fill a sleep by her art. and
when he was a sleep she made him a litill wound^ where out ^he drew his old
blood / And left him in this point by the space of.vij^ hours / After this
she awoke him and made him to issue out of the bayne all naked hole and sound
of all his members as he had been in the aage of two an thretty year

When the preu Jason and the King his fader him self saw thexperience of this
craft and mysiere. certes they had great meruayll and not without cause. for
this was a werk that never was seen ne happend to fore And so much preysed the
wit / the connyng^ and the virtues of the fair Medea. that they Iuged her to
be inspired of the Goddes^ Then^e the noble king Eson when he fond him self in
this estate / he sent for the best tailours and makers of garnements. And
did do make for his body all new habillements after the faco^n that the young
men ware at that time / after this he went and put him to the chaas or hunting
and to the deduyt of (...) and ha^^kes to make esbatements / fes^es. dau^ces
and tourn^y^s ^oustes and other plays. And for to short our matter he so
conduysed him self as a man made all new / Hit was not l^ng after this that
Peleus and all the nob^^ of the country and other were advertised herof^
Wherefore great nomb^e of people came to Pintaquo only for to see the king Eson
that was strongly enclyned to singe. dau^^e and to do al Ioyouse things. And
yet that more is he saw gladly the fair Damoiselles / And for to make short
he held him self as a young Prince that had no Regard save only to make good
chere and to pass the time Ioyously

PEleus. his wife Cypriane. and his daughters came unto the king in the
renouellite of this noble respyrement / Medea lay with Jason and conceived of
him a right fair sone of whom she was deliuerid in good time. And anon^ after
the burth^ of this second sone / Cypriane came on a day to Medea and required
much instantly that of her grace she would make young again Peleus / which
began strongly to were ancient and old. Certes the fair medea was right
Joyous when she saw her so required. and thinking in her self that she would be
avenged of the disloyal Peleus the which intended to have made Jason be ded.
She acorded to her this request and took day for to do hit. and when the day
was comen / Medea com^anded to Cypryane that she should make ready a much noble
bayne. After she sent for to fe^che peleus which was much Ioyeus / for so
much as he suppos^d to become young again lyk as he had been tofore. And then^e
when all was ready / peleus dispeilled him of his clothes and entered into the
bayne / Medea made him to sleep there / And when he was a sleep she took to his
two daughters to each a sword well trenchant in her hands / and made hem to
make on the body of Peleus their fader moo then^e fifty wounds mortal. Sayng
that they must needs do so / And then^e when peleus was adoubed and h^r^ and
that of his life was no remedye^ medea awoke him and said in this manner. Ha / a
right unhappy trayttre thou sendest late Jason into Colchos wenyng for to have
made him deye there without any respyte / wherefore thou have deseruid the deth^
that shall be now this our inhumayn and by the hands of thy propre doughters^
and therwith^ Medea deperted from the chamber. And peleus thus myserably
finisshed his life and his days

When Cypryane and his two daughters were adutised of thise tydinges. they
escried much sorowfully. and in weeping great teeris in great anguissh^ drew
out of the meruaillous bayne the pour body of peleus. and leyde hit a long
upon a table^ but Cypryane had the heart so strayte shette that she might not
speak. and not without cause For as soon as she had leyd peleus upon the table.
she fill doun^ reussed all a swou^ne / and then^e the doughter^ considering the
great meschief that was befalle to them. took the two swerdes yet all blody
with which they had put their fader to death and smote them self to the h^rt in
such wise that they fill doun^ deed and despaired upon the ^^dy of the^^
sorrowful moder^ which then^e revived out of her swou^ne. A (...) right
pietous and dolorous caas. Cypryane comen again to her self and seeing in her
p^sence this myschi^f and r^doublement of sorrow / could hold none other
mayntene sauf for to cry with all her puissau^ce also hye and ferdfully that
the king Eson and his sone being not f^r fro thens in a toure by the chamber.
were greatly afraid with this cry. And in especial when they beheld first
the body of peleus put upon the table al enuiron^ed with wou^des. Secondly
when they saw and apperceyued the two young Damoiselles daughters of peleus
having styked in their bodies unto their hertes the swerdes where with they
were slain / And thirdly seeing cypryane lyyng upon the pament / her heart
faylling cra^ching her face and drawyng her here by great asprete of sorrow

THe king Eson and his sone Jason seeing this that said is came then^e unto the
lady and in approchyng releued her and leyde her on a bed that was there.
Then^e Jason began to doubt of medea for asmoche as oftetimes she had required
him that he would put to deth^ peleus because he had sent him into the isle of
colchos / when they had brought the lady on the bed. Eson the noble king and
his sone Jason began to reconforte her the best wise that they might / and
weeping tenderly they demanded her who had co^mysed this dolorous murdre /
Then^e the lady ansuerde with much great pain that medea was culpable / and
reherced to hem all the manner how she had made peleus to deye by the hands of
his two daughters / and how they seeing the shameful feet com^ysed by them were
despate and sl^we hem self in great sorow^ and telling this her heart failled.
the king intended to her and Jason deperted thens and went to medea which was
in her chamber and said to her / A ha dame whereto were ye eu born^ into this
world / the merits of your benefetes ben great and digne of glory / but your
puers demerites ben somoch^ horrible and foul that they stayne al your
virtues. My dear lord said then^e medea. Ne know ye not how peleus sent you
into colchos by his enhortement for somoche as he supposed that ye neu should
have returned / and also ye had been deed without remedie^ ne had been that ye
escaped the danger by my cou^ceyle as it is well known. Thise things
considerid and seen that he had no cause to purchase to you such^ a danger for
ye neu deseruid it / wherefore I have many times desired you to take punyco^n
upon the desloial peleus to which ye would neu entende / so it happend that
peleus had a will for to be Reduyte in to young age as the king your fader is by
mine Introduccion and style but his two daughters have put him to death whereof ye
ought to be right Joyous / Certes dame ansuerde Jason ye say that pleseth^ you
/ but ye have do so now and also other times that ye shall euere be holden in
reproach. and therefore that now and other times ye have com^ysed and done to be
com^ysed^ many enorme inhumayne and hydouse feats. I renon^ce you in all
points and your company / and com^and you unto the gods. After these words
Jason departed fro the chamber sore disconforted / and without taking leave of
the king his fader ne of other person he departed allone upon his hers fro the
castle of Pyntaquo

When Medea had understand that Jason / to whom she had do so much as her
seemed of honor and other things. Renonced her company / And that she
apperceyued that he had taken his horse. and was allone departed out of the
castell^ She took her youngest sone in her arms and two of her damoiselles in
her company. And in this wise went after Jason thinking to repease him by
fair words / but the preu Jason that was in over great trouble and anger rode
all way forth^ tofore him so long that he entrid into a forest^ And
continuelly had his beu and sight toward the earth. thinkyng on the malefetes
of Medea and of her Inhumanytes and murdres / And he went so far in to the
wood that Medea knew not where he becam how well she returned not to Pintaquo
but sought always Jason as long as the day endured. And at night. she / her
child and the two Damoiselles lay under a tree for the better wyth^ sore
bewaillyng

THe king Eson did do burye this night his brother peleus and his two daughters
honorably and made a meruaillous sorrow for their deth^ / but when it came at
the even and that medea ne Jason his sone came not to him as they were
acustomed. his sorrow doublid in great anguissh and in great displaisir / and
cessed not all the night to be in great thought and melancolye. when the morning
was comen he sent out his men into the wood for to seche Jason and Medea /
but they that so were sent could not find them ne here no tydinges of them And
the preu Jason went always forth also pensif as he migh^t be. and his adventure
was su^he that after many iourneyes and many ways and champaynes trausid as he
that rode by day and in the night restid and let his horse bayte and pasture in
the feldes and meadows / he arrived in the cite of Corinthe where as was the
king of that country named Creante. the which had then^e a fair doug^ter named
Creusa. Jason went unto this creante and gaf him to knowlech what he was. but
creante as soon as he hadd knowlech of him did him much great honor for the
loos and good reno^mee that he had gotten by his Right hye valiance in many a
royame and country

IN corinthe then^e Jason dweld and abode a certain space of time. Creusa that
was a right fair lady / beheld often times Jason / And desired with good will
to be acompanyed with him^ but Jason was so empesshid with sorrow and of
melancolye^ that he might take none head of hit And furthermore he was so
charmed that in no wise / he might love none exept Medea^ When the king Creante
apperceyuid the maintene of Jason and that he made no Joy by continuance of
time. he came to him on a day and coniured him that he should tell him the
cause of his anoye and grief / And how well that Jason excused him. allewaye
the king oppressid him more and more and did so much by fair wordes^ that
Jason confessid to him the auentures that were befallen between him and Medea
and said to him also how he was departed fro his country / more for to
withdraw him fro Medea and to forgete her then^e for any other cause / But he
could not find the manner ne mean for to come to his above

THe king Creante which was a wise prince knowing the caas of Jason by this
that he gaf him knowleche would be his cordial frende^ for he cou^ceylled him
that as soon as he might he should take and wedde a new wyf^ saying that the
love and new acqueyntau^ce of a new wife should make him lightly to lose and
forgete the thoughts and Imagynacions of love and the plaisirs that he hath^
had in the first. when Jason had understand that the king conceylled him
wisely / and that he said to him the secret of the caas. he thanked him
much. and said that he would marie him if he could find a wife after his
estate^ And therwith^ he took leave of the king. and withdrew him into his logys
And it was not long after that he ne returned unto the palace of the king for
to see the ladies / And among all other he began to behold the fair Creusa.
And approuched to her wenyng to require her of love / but when it came to the
opening of his month^. certes the souuenau^ce of medea came tofore him that took
away all his entendements in all points / when Jason saw this that said is. he
arose up from thens and entrid into a gardyn where he fond him self so
melancolious and troubled in his courage that he knew not what he might do best
/ Then^e it happend that the king anon after came into this gardyne for to
reclayme a sperhawke of his^ but he found Jason set under the tree / Then^e
he went to him for to Resone with him. And Jason arose incontinent as he saw
him come And then^e the king axed him how it was^ and how he felt him^ Certes
sire ansuerde then^e Jason / me seems that I am always in one point / and
after said to him in this wise Sire I remember well how ye have cou^ceylled me
for to absteyne me to think on Medea. the which is continuelly in mine
entendement for to take to wife some new Lady Wherefore I require you and pray
with all my heart that ye will give to me Causa your daughter to spouse and
felawe. and ye so doing shall do to me the grettest honor and plaisir that may
come to me^ for if it be other wise I am the most evil fortuned knigh^t that is
in the remenan^t of the world

INcontinent as the gentil king had vnderstonden the Request of Jason / as a
prince right Joyous answerde to him and said / Certes Jason ye do to me and to
al our hows great honor when ye require for your felawe and wyff my dough^ter
/ I give to you my dough^ter. and she is well destyneed and comen into this
world for you. Certes I accord your Request and give her to you. With
these words the king sent for the Queen / his daughter / and for the Baron^s
and knigh^tes / of his court^ the Ladies and Damoiselees as well of his palais
as of his Cite (...) sen^e (...)^ and in the (...) of all them that (...) were
he made Jason and his d^ughter to promise that they should wedee and espouse
each other / within a certain term that ws tho said. and after these things
by the (...) of his barons knights and the ladies the day of th^re
espousailles was o^deyned / and did do make there a feste so fare and notable.
that like was never seen in all that country For the king and the Queen were so
Joyous of this nolle allyau^ce as possible was for hem to be / There were
daunces and carolles begone instruments of all faco^ns set a werk / songs
and fair dytees songen in the best wise^ wine and mete were plenteuously araied
and dressed for all them that would take. And thus endured this great and notable
feste unto the night / that the king^ the queen / Jason. creusa the Barons /
knights ladies and damoyselles departed fro this gardyn with much great
Joy. for each man enforced him to make great chere for the noble aliance of
the preu Jason and of the fair Creusa / but who that ever was Joyous or
soroufull the young lady was much conforted and not without cause thinking on
the hye virtues that were in the person of the valiant prince Jason

How Jason espoused the fair Creusa the kings daughter of Corinthe^ and of her
deth^ by Medea
THe renom^ee of this weddyng of Jason and of the fair Creusa was anon sprad
in all the royaume of corinthe^ The king concluded that he would make a solemn
feste / and sent his messagers into many and dyuce countries for to assemble
the Princes of the countrees his friends and (...) to seek clo^^e^ of gold of
silk and other sump^^ous and rich things / Always for to ^^siewe the ver^^
and true na^^ac^on of our matere. during the (...) an^ trouth^plightyng of
Jason and of Creusa Medea that lef^^ not nigh^t ne day for to seek her husbonde
Jason as said (...) She erred and labored in such wise as she came unto the
metes and marches of corinthe / and well concluded in her self that she would
go unto corinthe. And as she w^^te in her way she found a much fair fontaine
or well. where about satte and were many laborers that at this spring
refresshed them. when they apperceyued the lady and the two damoisele^ come
unto the fontayne. certes they were sore ameruail^d to see three so fair women^.
how well they axed hem whyther they went^ wherefore demand ye said medea / for
as much far dame ansuerde one of the laborers that we will go unto the cite
of corinthe / and if it plese you to go theder that our company^ may plaise you
/ we shall gladly hold you company. My friend ansuerde medea / know ye that
our entencion is for to go into the cite that ye speak of. and that right well
pleseth^ us your company

With that the noble lady damoiselles and tho laborers went on her way /
and so going one of them began to behold the litil child sone of Medea that
one of the damoiselles bare in her arms / and when he had a litil behold the
child he said all on hye in this manner / Certes I would that it plesid all
our gods that my Lady Creusa that to morrow come.ix. months might have one
so fair a sone by her lord / Fair friend said then^e Medea What is that
Creusa that ye now speak of / what is she (...) the labourer. And why know ye
her (...) so long. Cer^^^ she is daughter of the king of ^^^rinthe whom shall
Bed to morn^ the most fair (...) of the world and the most vailliau^t in
(...). For hit is he that had conquered I (...) of gold that men say is
passing (...) we all go to geder for to see what (...) shall be / and each of
us bear theder of our goods for to (...) the weddyng. The custom at that time
was such when that a king did do marie his sone or daughter / that all the
men of the royaume were ^ounden each by him self for to make a present of
vytaylles. And the marcha^te^ and bourgeyses of the Cytees made to him an (...)
of a certain som^e of money and of other goods wherewith th^^ were dyscharged

Anon then^e as Medea understood this that the labo^rer spac^ of the knight
that was so fair and so v^^liau^t and that had conquered the fl^^^ of gold.
(...) well that hit was her lord Jason that (...) the morn^ the fair Creusa.
wherefore she was sore (...) and not without cause. (...) se^ Jason. She looked
so long that she aspied him. but her (...) that he had an heavy chere and was
soroufull^ then^^ was Medea sewre that hit was Jason that should wedd Creusa.
Then^e began her heart to melte in such wise that there departed from thens
many and great plente of sighs. and many teeris deualed and fill doun^ from
her eyes upon her breast / And thus doing she thought and again thought what
was to do for the best / And then^e she returned unto the two Damoyselles.
and sent one of them well disguised unto Jason for to require him that he
would come and speak to a lady that was there

THen^e the noble preu Jason nothing thinkyng on the ^ayr Medea heering the
Request of the Damoyselle ^oose up and went wyth^ her^ and she brought him
unto Medea which was withdrawn a litill a part holdyng (...) liti^^ sone in
her arms / But Incontinent as Jason apperc^yued her there in that point he was
meruayllously of may^d. And after that Medea had made to him the (...) in
sal^wyng him by all their gods. She said ^o him in thi^ manner. Al^^ my dear
lo^d Jason. what (...) so that (...) morn^ withou^e (...) ye will take for your
wife Creusa whom ye (...) a^ I am ^ert^fyed. And how my only (...) love and
(...) shall I be sallaryed of such (...) of the salvation of your life / of

merit that ye rendee to me (...) love I have abandonned the king my (...) and
(...). Is this the gwerdon that I have awayted after that I have reduysed by so
great labor and travail my lord your fader the king from his ancient aage
unto the yongth^ of.xxxij. year as ye well know A ha Jason right noble and
valiant knight^ I suppose ye hold well in your remembran^ce all that ye have
promised to me. for gods sake forgete it not and put it not in oublian^ce /
And if hit be so that ye will take and have any other lady then me / Certes I
had lever now to lose my life then to live any longer / sle me. my deth^ be
perdoned unto you

DAme ansuerde then^e Jason. what as to the regard of the wedding now begon^e^
if it plese the Gods they shall be perfaited and fulfild as it is ordained not
with stonding any promysse that hath^ ben made between you and me When medea
herd this answer she fill doun^ to the earth al a swou^ne or in a tran^ce
sayng / A ha mine only and souayn well then^e shall ye be pariured / Certes dame
ansuerde Jason Sauue your honor / I have acquytte unto you all that I have
promised unto you^ for I have brough^t you into my country and solempnly have
espoused you. and syn I have be true in marriage unto the deth^ of mine uncle
peleus / where as ye well know has been co^mysed by you a great defaute. Not
withstondyng this that is past I entende not that by me ye should be
s^lawndrid^ But know ye that I had much lever live in honor and ensiewe the
terms and works of noblesse then^e for to hold me longer in your company /
I tell you these things for so much as if I held me longer by you / And of
you ne were done good Iustice^ hit migh^te be said that I should be culpable of
one so cruel a ^urdre. whereof is ensiewed the deth^ of two so fair and noble
maidens and pucelles daughters of Peleus. And for this cause and other cruelles
by you com^ysed. I shall hold that I have said. And so I may do and ought to
do lawfully in keeping mine honor and the terms and com^andements of our law

When the fair Medea had understood all the will and conclusion of the noble
preu Jason. if she had been to fore soroufull and over angry. yet was she
then^e much more. For she began to weep wyth^ these words and to sigh^e fro
her heart so parfondly that hit seemed that there deperted from her two fair eyes
two ruysseauls or two springes of a fontayne^ This notwith^standing after many
sighs from the heart so perfondly she repliqued unto thanswere of Jason and
said. Ha / a sir knight I know well now that it is destine that I owe to be
the most Infortunat lady of the world / if I have consented or cou^ceylled
the deth^ of the desloyall Peleus / hit hath^ ben for the great love and right
true that I have had for tauenge you of this that he by his false cou^ceyll
sent you into Colchos to make the conquest upon the flees of golden knowing
that hit was a thing inpossible ever to return wyth^oute to be devoured and
ded if hit had not be my pourueyance / and when I have done all thise
things wyth^ good entencion and for to get your grace. ye will now leave and
repudye me in all points / wherefore I may well say that under the firmament
is no more Infortunat creature in all tribulacion then^e I am / Ha / a my dear
love and friend Jason shall I have none other salaire ne other gwerdon for all
my merits

CErtes dame ansuerde then Jason ye have moch^ more then^e ye have deseruid for
such trespaas. such^e Reward. for the conuerture of the trespaas by you done
can not excuse you. do the best ye can or may and your children also. withdraw
you with your children into some country and so shall ye do wisely and also your
prouffit^ My dear lord said then^e Medea / syn it is your plaisir that it so
be. hit must needs be that it plese me. And so be it always that your plaisirs
ben fulfillid^ yet at the lest for to reioye me a litil. ye shall do to me
somoche grace that of your curtoisye I may be loggid here within unto to morrow
to the end that I may see the sollempnyte of the weddin^ ^ if ye will thus
accord to me I promette you that to (...) at d^^er for (...) love of you. I
shall make app^re visibly one of the great meruailes that ever was seen at
weddinge of a ^ynge^ d^ughter or of a pryn^e

When Jason (...) vnd^rstande the request of the lady not thinking that she
pretended but unto all well and good and also for to be quytt of her /
accorded her request And was deliuyd to her a right fair chamber within the
palais / And when the lady was in this chamber she sent her two damoiselles for
to be logged in the town / So hit happend when she was there allone she began
to study in many of her sciences / and when it came about midnighte she did
her to be transported into the air / and she brought into her chamber with
her plente of works Rygh^t secret Wheerof she composed four great and
horrible dragons whom she knetted to gyder by their taylles / and maad ^s hit
had been a chain. And then^e this done she passed in this point that night so
sore passioned with Ialousye of love that her seemed that her heart and all her
body were all esprised with fire and flambe^ So hit happend on the morn^ when
Jason had espoused the fair Creusa and that he was set at dinner with her and
with the king fader of the lad^ and with the knights ladies and damoyselles of
(...). Then^^ Medea departed from her chamber (...) the m^ddes of the four
dragons holdyng her youngest sone all naked in her hands. And in this point
she made her to be brought to fore the table where as the nob^e preu Jason was

C^rte^ ^ut i^ well lightly to believe that the king ^ the no^le preu Jason /
and also all they that were the^ Were gretl^ ^sma^ed and ferd when they
apperceyued (...) enter in to the halle sittyng ^ytwene four (...) so terri^le
to behold by semblau^t / And some there were (...) fled. And som^e abode to
see thauenture seeing that she held between her hands the young child But when
M^dea saw that she was a fore Jason. She escried him in this manner. Jason /
Jason thou know that I am thy wife / thou leuest me for another / and wenest
thy self not to have mesprised to me. I have saved thy life And thou doste to
me great wrong and ouermoche great blame. And this procedeth^ fro the of all
desloyalte and of all mauastie. whereof thou art chief and heed^ And such will thou be and abide. but I shall keep the from it if my connyng faylle not. For
certainly I promise the that thy new wife Creusa and the king her fader and al
they that been here within shall lose their life. Reserved thy self. and by
consequent thy propre sone that I hold in my propre arms shall be the first
that shall begin the feste

When the desolate lady had said these words she holdyng her young child
wh^iche was much tendre^ took him by the two legs and by the force of her
arms Rent him in two pieces. and in that point cast him in the plater to fore
Jason and Creusa / And with that the four terrible dragons on whom she satte
opende their throtes in disgorging fire and venym^ somoche and so horribly that
all they that were there deyde myserably and in great torment reserved Ias^n
which might not receive any greef by no venym by^cause of the blood of the

long in the chapitre making mention of the conques^e of the noble fl^se of gold

THen^e when the preu Jason apperceyued the young child so inhumaynly slain.
and after saw in his presence dye miserably and in sorrow his lady Creusa / the
king the queen his baron^s knigh^tes ladies and damoiselles squiers and other
by the sorts and enchantements of Medea. he was so over angry and wroth^ that
he might no more be without he had been out of his mind / Then^e he aroos from
the table all confuse and escried upon medea sayng / A ha right evil
enchanteresse replenisshed with all evil / certes it is over great do^mage
that the earth bears and susteyneth^ you. ye have with your two hands

When the lady had understand the complaynte of her lord Jason / She answerde
h^im and said in this manner. Certes my dear love know ye for trouth^ / that
I had lever see all the world deye. then^e I knew that ye should have

all this have I done gladly to thentent that ye should be my husbonde and

abandonne me for one other in all estate less then^e I am / her malefices and
her crueltes ouermoche inhumayne / and in riding from one place to another he
was in so great perplexite and sorrow that he might no more but if he had deyde
And for this cause he had his entendement so travailed that he wist not what to
do. In this manner trist and pensyf drawyng from one country to an other hit
was told him on a day that the king Tollus of Elsebee that was his parent and

I left your love and concluded that I would make of Medea my Lady paramours as
I did. and for this cause she gafe to me the Introduccion and the manner to
conquer the noble and Rich moton^. of whom I have brought the noble Flees on
this side the sea And also I have brought with me in to Myrmydone Medea no

right humbly if in any manner I have trespaced or misprised against you that ye

CErtes s^r knight ansuerde then^e the noble lady / I have here tofore somoche

after this weddingis^ ye shall put you in guise of a servant in disfiguring
your self as moch^ as is in you possible. and ye shall serve me as a servant.
but when we shall be in Oliferne* ye may have me secretly to your wife / and thus
Medea shall nothing know ne non^ other person of you and of me. And will she or
not the strong enchanteresse that so long hath^ holden you in her sorts and in
dangeres of her arts. from hens forth^ we shall enjoy the loves of us each
other. Then^e the preu Jason was content for to conduyte him self in this manner
in all such wise as the queen myrro had ordained whereof she was right joyous
For tabregge the matter during thise weddinges Jason and myrro often times spack
to gyder of their amorette^ and Jason received there many fair preysinges
which were to long to reherce / In the end the weddinges finisshid and one and
other took leave and went home into their countries. and so it ought not to be
forgoten that Jason went to ^lifern^ with the fair myrro in lubite disguised
as a yeman (...) a servant and named him self Sambor

When the^^e the lover and the lady had so exploited that (...) were in

bruyt she mari^^ sam^^r and after sent the priest away. and to the end that he
sh^lde be secret she gafe him a purse fu^ of gold. She held her spouse in her
chambre^ And then^e when the priest was goon^. and that they were both to
gyder / they began in good ernest the deduyte that is used in the amerouse life.
And Righ^t Ioyously they conforted each other. And demened this amerouse life
all the long winter^ and so ye ought to bileue that on the day the preu Jason
seruid in his office. and in the night he entremeted well fro the art and
enchantements of Medea. Then^e Iaso n promised to her that he so would do. and
concluded there the day of his depting

ANd when Jason and the queen myrro hadd cessed of speking of this matter the
damoiselle that had declared the feet to her brother brutorus was awayting and
aspyeng at the hole^ and understood all that the lady and Jason had devised /
said and concluded. Then^e she adutised her brother and told to him all that
she had vnderstonden and the day tha^ he should deperte into his country /
This brutorus was right joyous when he understood these tydinges / and
concluded in him self that he would lie in a wa^te of Jason in a wode by a way
by which he must needs (...) he called to him.xij. gentilmen of his knowleche^
and tol^ them that sa^^lor had trespassed to him and that he would slay him on
s^^he a day as he should deperte unto his country For ta^rege the matter when
the day was comen the noble p^nice deperted with much bewailling of his lady.
and wo^t him self all one by that wode. and he had not long erred and riden in
the wood when brutorus and his.xij. felaws without eserieng or sownyng of any
word smote upon him great stookes and mortel if he had not well be armed at his
depting as his aue^ture was he had be deed / and among all other brutorus gaf
him a meruaillous stroke upon the head that whether he would or not he made him
bow on the lift side

When Jason felt him so aduiron^ed and assailed of these traitres and that
they smote upon him on all sides he was all abasshid / Nevertheless he set
him at deffence. and then^e he drew out his good swerd^ with which he
befought his enemies right vayllyau^tly and as a noble knight as he was. But
the place where Brutorus assaylled him over asprely / was in holowe and strayt
passage. in such wise as Jason might not but wyth^ great pain help him self
/ for the disloyal tra^ttre and his conplices were on boothe sides. six on
that one side / and six on that other mounted upon hye territories that henge
over the holowe way. and casted great stones upon him. in such wise that they
slew and murdered his horse under him. and in feat they frussled his helm and
made him a meruaillous wound in his head / The^^e when Jason saw his horse
deed and that he felt the smarte of the sore in his head. he set him a foot
all astonyed. but brutorus and his felawes assailed him again and cast on him
stones. glayues / and swerdes / where wyth^ they bruysed and wounded him in many
places / for the horions and strokes came from above. Nevertheless Jason as a
valiant knight marchid out over the passage and did so much that he came into a
right fair land. Then^e Brutorus and his folk s^ewed him so far / that they
came to fight hand a hand. And among all other Brutorus approached unto his evil
adventure. For Jason smote him upon the top of his helm by such fierste that
he clefte the helm and the heed unto the teeth^ that he fill doun^ ded at his
fe^^

THus as ye may understand was the desloyall brutorus myserably slayn^. And
then^e when his accomplices apperceyued that he was put to vtteran^ce they
escried al upon Jason and assailed him on a new right anguisshously in renewyng
to him the dolor and great pain of his wou^des and frousshures that they maad
to him in the holowe way as said is / and so began the stoure aspre and
terrible How well that Jason had more courage then^e puissaunce Always he
defended him by righ^t great vigor in bathing his trenchan^t sword in such
wise in the blood of these.xij murdrers that he put seven of them to deth^
with Brutorus And after fough^t long with the remenan^t / and it fortuned him
that in scarmusshing that he hurt the Remenan^t unto the death / as he that
escaped not net but was hurt in so many places that by theffusion of blood
that fill from his head / his heart failled him in the end and fill down among
the deed men^ The four last that were left were but litil better then^e
deed. But what meruaille

When the two murdriers had born^ to ground the preu Jason / they wend that he
had been deed. and satt deun by for to rest them and after soft and fair they
with^drewe hem into the cite as they that with much great pain might uneath
sousteyne hem self. but for to go unto their houses they must pass tofore the
palais. the Queen then espied them from far. and apperceyued anon that they
were all bespreynt with blood whereof she was much esmayed She did do hem to
be called and syn demanded them from whens they came. Alas my dear lady said
one of them We come from an evil Iournee / for sambor and *viij. of our next
kyn and friends ben lyyng deed in the wode with brutorus / which brough^t us
theder for to lie in a wait for to slay sambor / the which as he hath^ said
to us / hath^ don to him displaisir / but sambor hath^ put us all to deth^
reseruid us four which ben so pitously hurt. that but if the gods inparte
to us of their grace we ben in great danger of ou^e lives

IN sayng thise words two of these four knights deyde there suddenly. whereof
the noble queen was so sere abasshid that her heart faylled and fill doun^ in
swou^ne^ that she was born^ into her chamber by her damoiselles / And the two
malerous knights were born^ f^r to be buried after the custom of the country.
When the lady was a litill comen to her self / by thefforce of the great sorou
that she had in her heart she escried passing hye and said. Jason / Alas my
love Jason and my lorde^ But srowhens sourdeth one so great maleurte or
myshappe that ye have thus ben slain in the wood / The terrible cruelte of
thenuenymed and so horrible bestes of Colchos had no power to grieve thy person
/ Ne the sudden parils of the sea ne also the great hardynes of the Esclauons.
Ha^ a the right evil Brutorus ye have slayn^ him and he hath^ slayn^ you. Alas
what great loss must I suffer this day. I am born^ in an unhappy our When
hit must be that I have nourisshid the murdrere that traytoursly hath^ put to
deth^ the noble knight Jason which is my lord and husbond. Ha^ a noble and
worthy of all worthy^ the vaillyau^t of all vaillian^s. and he in whom all
virtues haboun den^ the gods have mercy of thy soul. And if thou be not over
dede^ that they will hold the so long a live that I might yet ones speak wyth^
the And I shall be much the more comforted that I shall deye more eysyly. And
then^e I desire no longer to live in this world after the

When the ladies and damoiselles there being had herd and vnderstonden of the
queen by her lamentacions that he that was named sambor was Jason that somoche
was recom^anded in valian^ces and in virtues meruailed strongly for asmoche as
he served as a yeman. and at last comforted the lady the fairest wise they
might. And then^e she declared all openly that sambor was Jason the noble
knigh^te and none other but he had wedded her. and furthermore she declared for
what cause Jason had changed his name and wh^ he maintened him as a yeman or
s^ruan^t. After this declaracion and lamentacion^ (...) ^ide do assemble all
the nobles of the cite as well ^en as women. and thus she sent solempnly for
to f^oche the bod^ of the v^^llian^t prince Jason. And com^anded that b^utorus
and his felaws should be quar^^rd and h^ng^d on the gal^^^es as traitors / And
they that were com^^sed to the^s^a^sion of the Justice accomplissh^d (...)
their charge ^ com^ission and the company that hadd charge for to go (...) the
body of Jason went unto the place wir^e the disloyal murdre was com^ysed / But
when they were there comen they found that Jason was not yet deed / but he
sact up and lened unto one of the traitres. Thus this noble company seeing that
he was yet a live / made to him righ^t great chere and callid him by his name.
Sayyng that the Queen Myrro and they all were so Right displaisan^t of his
Inconuenyent that they might no more be. And without long soiournyng there^
they leyd the nobbe and vaillian^t knight Jason upon a shield which they
found there lieng upon therthe and bare him unto the Cite. And the noble Queen
came against him for she had been adutised by her men that he was not yet deed /
how well she wept sore tenderly

When the fair Mirro was comen nygh^ unto her lord And that she apperceyued
that he was so frusshid and brusshid with stones and staves / certes her heart
failled. and they that bare Jason restid unto that she was comen again to her
self And then^e she ne Jason might not speak / Jason for the anguissh that he
suffrid. and she for the great displaisir that she had at her heart / But it
was not long after that Jason was born^ unto the chamber of his espouse and
felawe. where the best Cirurgyens of the cite came that anon^ visited and
serched his wou^des. and fond him in such terms that they undertook to
render him hole and sound of all his hurtes and wou^des in short time. whereof
the queen was all recomforted. they faylled not of their promys / for they so
wrought about him by such faco^n that in the space of six months they
deliuerid him hole and out of danger of all his hurtes and wou^des. During
which time of six months that the noble preu Jason kept his chamber /
asson^ as he might speak and have entendement he began to bewaille the loss
of his time for asmoche as he might not be at the destru^cyon of the king
Laomedon^ and of the Trojans Wherefore he had much great displaysir at his
heart. For he had not ben acustomed gladly to keep / the chambres ma^ted ne
strewed with herbs and flowers / ne the beds encurtyned^ the halles hanged
wyth^ rich tapesseryes Ne the places magnyficque ne somptuouse as by bys
feats appereth^^ but he might not amend hit. For the noble queen recomforted
him always / And much required him that he should take no Melancolye for no
thing / And that he ne should entende save only to his garisshing and heeling /
and as for the war of Troy he might in no wise be there

How the king Eson of Mirmidone asseged his sone Jason in the cite of Oliferne
/ And how Medea spack to Jason / and how she slew his oldest sone named Jason
As ye may understand by thin^onuenyent before said the preu Jason was
distourned for tacompanye hercu^es and the cheualerye of Greece that should go
leye siege tofore the puissau^t cite of Troy / wherefore the king Eson and
hercules were right sorouful and abode.xv. days longer then^e the term that
they had set for to go to the sea / when the ^xv. days were past and
apperceyued that they hadd no tydinges of the coming of Jason / they departed
fro the port where they had taried^ And sailled so far that they arrived
tofore Troy with so great nombre of people that notwithstonding the
resistance of laomedon^ of all the cite and country about. they besieged it.
and so long abode and did meruaillous assaults / that they took hit and
destroyed it in the form and manner as is well declared in the history of
the.xij. labors of the noble and preu Hercules / And when they had brough^t
th^is enterprise to an end each of them departed from thens and returned into
his country

IN the nouelte then^e that the noble king eson of mirmidone was returned fro
the conquest of Troy sore trobled for his sone Jason that was failled to have been at this hye honor. Medea that was not yet comen again into Mirmidone
after that she was deperted the same day that she had made to deye the
desloyall peleus as said is Returned then^e unto the king Eson all destayned
and discolored. y clad with clothes all to rent and lapped Then^e she set
her down on both her knees tofore the king Eson and after said to him in this
manner / Sire lo here Medea the most pour and the most infortunat lady that eu
was or shall be^ Thou know and may not deny that I ne am the propre wyff
of thy sone Jason / whom I made not long syn Return gloriously fro the
mortal parill where his uncle Peleus had sent him to by his malice^ This
notwithstonding incontinent and in feat he has abandonned me syn the day that
I was consenting to the deth^ of the disloyal Peleus / And I did hit for to
take vengean^ce of this that he sent him traitrously under the shadow of the
conqueste of the Rich moton with the flees of gold which was a thing
inpossible to any creature humayne with^oute mine adressement / and well supposed
he that he never should have returned but have auau^ced his deth^. And he
would excuse him under the color of this deth^. the which allwaye I did for
his loue^ and for tauenge him

Sire said yet the lady ye know that the day that peleus deyde. your sone
departed from hens much hastyly^ and how I went after / and hit was so our
adventure that I found him on a day in the cite of Corinthe. where he had
fian^ced the kings dough^ter / And there I spack long with him. And among many
Remonstran^ces I required him right instantly that he would be true acording
to his promys that he had made in acquyting his faith^ But I labored in vayn.
for he would in no wise entende thereto / And when I apperceyued that I could
have none other thing of him / I made by the virtue of som^e enchanments deye
suddenly the espouse / whom he had supposed to have enioyed^ And with her deyde
her fader and by consequent all they that were in the halle set at dinner /
reseruid Jason whom in no manner I would touch / and after I deperted from
thens and have goon at the adventure of the gods / not thinking that eu I
should return unto you / thus has fortune be to me of such condico^n that
she has s^th.ij. months brought me into the cite of Oliferne. and there I have
fou^den and seen Jason with the queen Mirro / and it has been certefied to me
that he has espoused her / whereof I have at my heart such do^our and sorou /
that for nothing I might ner could speak with him / but yet am departed from
thens and am come unto you for to require reffuge that in the favor of ladies
hit may plese you to have pite of me so desolate a lady / and that in
recognoissau^ce of the merit that I might have deseruid in reduysing your
ancient aage in the being of.xxxij. year that ye of your sone Jason will do me
right without Rygour

When the king Eson of Myrmidone had understand the doleance and the Request
of Medea^ and that he saw her in so pour estate of habillements that she
seemed all another woman / For she was so dyscoloured ^^ne / and evil arrayed.
Certes he had great pity of her Then^e he began to recomforte her and thinking
on the good services that she had don unto his sone whereof al his well and
Reno^me was comen. And in like wise of the great plaisir that she had don to
him. also how she had abandonned the king her fader and her country upon the
promysse of his sone. Among other words in recomfortyng her. he said and
promised her that he should punysshe Jason of that so great offense / and also
he had taken him in desdayne for somoche as he had failled at the besynes and
destruxion of Troy where the cheualerie of Greece had gotten great honour^ cer /
tes he loved medea meruai^lously / and anon he did do clothe her new right
honorably / and tamynisire to her all that was nedeful and necessary for her.
And when he had so do / he sent into o^iferne unto Jason and com^anded him
that Incontinent he should come unto his court / but Jason excused him to the
messager the most curtoisly that he might for cause of his wou^des that he had
received in the wode not long syn as said is. and in feat he ansuerde that at
that present he might go ner yet ride on an horse

INcontinent as the king Eson hadd understand thanswere of his sone Jason. he
took it evil in gre^ and swear that he would goo unto him^ but that should be
in arms / Then^e he sent into all parties for his friends and alyes / And
said to him and shewde how he would punissh^e his sone Jason for the lauesshenes
of his body and that by good cause / for because of his luxury he had failled
at the conquest of troye^ and under this couture he assembled unto the nombre
of ten.M. greeks whom he brought tofore oliferne the cite / and somoche did by
see and by land that with out adventure digne of memory he came on the
champayne / where the king of Esclauonye and his ooste to fore had holden their
siege to their vnhelthe as hit is said tofore in his place. Always Medea was
comen in tharmee of the king Eson as she that had in him all her affiau^ce and
her so^oure / as half garisshed or easid

When the king Eson fond him self tofore Oliferne He did do set his tents
and pauyllon^s / And sent unto his sone Jason that he should comen unto him
for to receive the punycion of his disobeysau^ce / Certes Jason was sore
abasshid and not without cause / when he had understand that his fader sent
for him to come to him upon this condico^n / And then^e when he apperceyued
that his fader had besieged the cite with armed hand / he was at that time all
helid of his wou^des and froussures. and sceyng that said is him seemed that the
king his fader was angry with him and that he was comen theder al replenisshid
with great furour Notwithstanding that in no manner he supposed to have
deseruid hit. And considering all thise things / and also by the cou^ceyll of
his friends for to answer the messager of his fader / he callid him and said
to him in this manner / Sir messager I have understand and thought for tanswere
upon that my fader has sent me by you / on that other side I see how he is
here comen with puyssau^ce in arms. Thise things considered I wot not what
is his entenco^n ne will Wherefore I am not for this present conseyled to put me
in his hands / how well that I am always bounden by all right and holden to serve
him and obey his com^andements. and that out of furour he shall not find me
other wise disposed

The messager hering the discret answer that Ias^n gaf him^ he acertained him
and thereof would abide in hostage. that if Jason would take again Medea as by
virtue of his faith^ he was holden and by the promesses that they had made one
to that other that he should find his traittye and peace with the king his
fader. Then^e Jason answerde to the messager that if the king his fader were
common theder there fore in such ordonan^ce and upon that entenco^n. he abused
him greatly / and that medea by her enchantements should never deceive him more
during her lyf^ When the messager had understand the will and answer of Jason.
he took leave of him and deperted from the palais. and returned unto the king
his lord / which abood him at foot of his tente / and told to him and to medea
all this that he had exploited with his sone Jason / The king and the lady
Medea h^ering his volente and will / and that he was not a man to be meuid and
turned from his courage had a meruaillous sorrow Then^e the king Eson swear that
he ne his siege should never deperte from thens for cold ne for heete for
froste^ ne snow / for rain ne for tempeste that migh^t comen upon him unto
the time that he had subiuged the cite of Oliferne. with that medea when she
had herd thise words she took leave of the king and returned into her tente /
and then she began to study in her enchantements and sorts where in she was
much learned. and in such wise exploited that in a moment she made her to be
born with^in oliferne / and did her to be set in the propre halle where
Jason and mirro the Queen were at a window speking to gydre of their works
and in especial of thenterprise that the king eson made upon them of which
they had great meruaille^ And so they wist not what to think saving that hit
were need for tentende to fortefie the muraille and walls of the cite / the
tours and yates to garnisshe with stones and wyth^ shot and to deffende
their strength^ with all their power But Jason and Myrro had the grettest
marvel of the worlde^ And not with out cause. when so suddenly they saw
Medea there appear in their presence. Then^e Medea opend this that she had in
will to say and declare plainly and said in this man^r

HA a Alas sir Jason have ye not entencion tamende your lyf^ which is so much
reprochable to fore the gods and the world. And cursed be the our and the
day that I saved and waranted you fro the deth^ / when for my Reward and
gwerdon^ I must suffer somoche and in so many manners as I doo^ and that in
time and in place ye know not her to whom ye be so greatly bounden and holden.
Dame ansuerde then^e Jason shall your sorts ne enchantementes never cesse / I
can not think how ye have the hardiness to come to fore mine eyen^ / seen
that in my presence ye have murdered one of my propre sons. And how ansuerd
then^e Medea / am I a lady born^ in so unhappy an our and so infortunat that
in no manner I dare be fou^den tofore mine espouse and husbond / and him that
holds his life of any other but by me. A Jason said yet the lady. the great
goodness that I have done for you to fore this time is litill remembryd and
known by you. which I did all of good heart / And if I have slayn^ your child
/ ye be only culpa^^^ / for ye do to me so many displaisirs and anoyan^ce. that
I can not think how the heart of any lady so desolate as I am may so long
endure

CErtes dame ansuerde then^e Jason I hold no thing that I have don to you
displeisir ne anoye in no wise Ye have co^mysed and made many enorme and right
evil caas. for which I may lawfully repudie and ab^ndon^e you in all pointes^
how well that for the love of me ye have done that I ne maintene not / and of
that other side speak no more to me / lo here the noble lady that I had promised
tofore that I arrived in your cou^trey^ and during the time that I have been
with you and ye with me ye put me by your enchauntements in such point that I
had al forgoten her and thought on none other but on you^ whether ye were f^r
or nygh / and in this estate was I a long space of time / and til that the
gods have resemblid this lady and me by your great defaute The which I have
now espoused. this is my lady and I am her lord and husbonde / and as long as
the soul shall abide in my body I shall be heeris. and I shall not withdraw me
from her ner shall take other then her for nothing that may befall me / and
otherwise ye shall not find it. and therefore abide no longer here / for if ye
did. it should be all time lost for more to poursiewe this enqueste. Medea
with this conclusion made her to be born^ from thens also sodeinly as she was
comen^ And in that same night she was deliuid and rendrid at Pintaquo in the
chamber where her sone Jason was nourisshed / And there she being full of a
Right evil will took the noble child that the king Eson maad soignously to be
kept by two norices / The noble child slept and was all naked at the our /
when she took him / wyth^ the taking he awoke. and seeing his mother he began
to lawhe sore. Then^e medea wept and said / Ha^ a Jason my dear sone thy
figure and semblan^t. and thy faders entresemble and ben lik. Thou art much
fair if thou might come to thaage of a man / certes thou sholdest ensiewe
and follow the manners of thy fader the most dou^le and leest true knight of the
world. hit is much better that thou deye an angel in thy yongth^ / then^e a
devil in thy old aage / and wyth^oute more speking or other bewaillyng she
drew out a sharp knyf in the presence of the two norices that wyste not what to
say. and smote him with the knif unto the herte^ And after departed thens at
that our that men might not see her^ And put her self in a wode al desperate
weping and making a passing great sorrow. And her adventure was such that
afterward she was in Athenes / and went not unto the king Eson fader of Jason
/ but went unto the king Eseus that was yet strong and puissaunt And gaf him in
knowleche what she was and of all her fortunes / ye by such faco^n that the
king Eseus took her in marriage and engendrid on her a sone the which was
called Medeus / But fortune that allway argued her made her to be accused that
she would have enpoysonned Theseus the noble knight and sone of her husbond
Egeus^ and furthermore made her to be banysshed fro Athenes^ where fore she was
sore troubled and not wyth^ out cause^ For she was constrained by pure
necessite that she must depart fro the Royaume of Corinthe / also pour and
evil fortunate that she wist not where to withdraw her / Always she went on
the day by a great wood in Thessayll where she liuyd much solitarily and in
great bitterness / And had there so great and fair repentan^ce of her sins
and of her evil lyff that she might no more have but if she should have
received the deth^ / And thus I shall tarry for this present time of the lady
and of her life / And recompte you of the noble Queen Myrro of Oliferne and of
the conclusion of this present book

How a knight named Patroclus slew the queen Mirro. How Jason departed sec^etly
from oliferne. How the Cite was yelden unto the king Eson. And how Jason and
Medea were Reconcilled to gyder
FOr to come to the end and conclusion of this matter then^e resteth^ now to
know that on the morrow when Medea was departed fro the oost of the king Eson
and fro the presence of Myrro and of Jason as hit contained all in the chapitre
precedent. The king Eson went for to see Medea in the tente that he had
ordained for her. For he loved her as his propre doughtrr^ but he found her
not. Ne there was neither man ne woman that could certefye him where she was
become^ whereof he had great meruaylle And did do seche her in many places^ but
he coud not have tydinges of her unto the end of three months that there came a
messager unto him that advertised him of the deth^ of the young child Jason sone
of Medea and of the preu Jason / And declared him all the manner how that Medea
had smyten him with a knyf into his herte^ And how there was no person that
knew where she was become syn the caas happend

INcontiment that the king Eson understood thise tydinges he was so angry that
by thasprete of his Ire he rent his vestymens and wept by great pite. for he
louyd the young child and Medea with all his heart. he said then^e that his
sone Jason should abye it. and that he should be punysshed as he that was cause
of all thise myschieues. and anon^ he sent to them of Oliferne that they
should issue to bataile against him. Upon which Jason ansuerde^ that for
nothing he would fight against his fader ne his people. but required that he
would leave them in pees / And when the king Eson had understand this answer /
he com^anded to assail the cite as he dide^ But his men were put a back righ^t
asprely by them that were within that defended hem that day right valian^tly /
and so by many Iourneyes the king made the cite to be assailled to their litil
prouffit / for as much as the cite was garnisshed with a great nombre of young
people and valian^t men that were there in aage competent for tencharge tharmes
syn the war of the puissau^t king of Esklauonye

As ye may understand the king Eson held long his siege tofore the strong and
rich cite of Olyferne with^oute gyuyng or receyuyng of other batailles of that
one party or of that other / And during this time. Jason and the fair Myrro
acustomed them to come oftetymes into a passing fair and strong toure standing
on the muraille of the Cite of Oliferne. and they came theder for to pass the
time in beholding in the champayne the tents and pauillons of king Eson and
the nobles of his royame / and so often went and came that they were known
Incontinent when the king was advertised / he sent on a day among all other
one of his knighbes named Patroclus that could shete with the hand bow so
redyly and nygh^ the mark that none was like unto him^ And said to him that
he should garnisshe him of his bow and arowes^ and that he should erly tofore
day hyde him in a busshe not far from the muraille and tour / promisyng to
him great yeftes if he might with one of his arowes slay the Queen Myrro.
when he saw her lokyng out of the wyndowe of this tour

THis busshe was even against the tour where the noble preu Jason and Myrro the
fair queen came as said is. The knight named Patroclus of whom now is made
menco^n in this history was he that after was cause and moyen of the deth^ of
the Right worthy knight Hector of Troy. And then^e when Patroclus was hydd
with in the busshe / he held him there with his bow bente right secretly /
And so long that dame fortune which oftime pleyeth^ with worldly things at
her volente and will brought Jason and Myrro into the great tour where as they
lened in the window. But they had not long ben there when patroclus the Just
archier losed an arowe upon the noble lady the Queen Myrro / ye so Right that
he smote and persed her in her throte^ in such wise that she fill doun^ deed
even by the noble preu Jason / And after this done he departed from the busshe
right Joyous. And contrary Jason was right sorouful and angry when he
apperceyuid his lady thus fall down deed. he supposed to have releued her / but
the soul was departed from the body / Then^e great teeres in great nombre
began to fall from his eyes in meruaillous habondan^ce^ and was so
displaisan^t of this myschief. so desolate and so angry that it is not to any
creature possible for to write or reher^e^ The barons / the knights the ladies
and damoiseles semblably in the cite were greatly discomforted. and gaf hem to
weep so right anguisshously in cries In bewaillinges and in such lamentacions
that non^ other sorrow was like unto this

WHat is to do upon this matter how may I nombre the teeris or write the
bewaillinges and lamentacions of preu Jason by especial / and of the knights
ladies and damoiselles of the cite / Certes in a full see of teeris and in a
mine of sighs and in a sourse or a spring of an inestymable sorrow / the pour
infortunat lady yielded her spirit by the hole of the arowe of the knight
partroclus. that was there cursed and bannyd as he that they hadd above all
other in great hate^ certes Jason might not speak in a great while or space /
neither he could not think. what he might best do. but at the end he deported
him a litil of his sorrow / And then^e he com^anded that the Lady should be
borne to her chamber into the palais / And then^e the ladies and Damoyselles
took her in Renewyng of wepynges and of bewaillinges and bare her into her
chamber for to ordeyne for her sepulture / This evil adventure was anon
known by all the Cite / all the world demened a meruaillous sorrow. men women
and children^ Fynably she was buried in her sepulture. for whom was made a
riall obsequye / And when they had done all the cerimonyes that apperteyned / In
the same nygh^t then^e when Jason was withdrawn to goo to rest Jason departed
out of the cite all allone. And had neu the power to take leave of man ne of
woman. he had his heart so soroufull and angry for the deth^ of the noble
lady the queen Myrro. And for thanger that the king his fader had against him

ON the morn^ by time the king Eson acerterned that Patroclus had slain the
queen Myrro of an arowe as he had required him / com^anded tassaylle the cite /
And when they of Oliferne apperceyued that their enemies approuched the walls
of their cite they sent unto Jason whom they had supposed to have fou^den in
his chamber for tadutise him of thise tidinges. but they fond him not. Then^e
as sore abasshid they went and sought him with in forth^. and in the temple
and many other places^ And then^e when they saw that noman could tell of him
they sent unto the portiers and demanded them if they had seen him. And there
was one that answerde for certain that at the our of midnight Jason was issued
out all one by that gate^ and more he knew not / When the nobles of oliferne
knew thise tydinges they were sore trobled and not with out cause. for they
beheld that they had no lord ne lady^ And that there fore ones they must
submyse them unto the king Eson And took their conceyll to gyder and concluded
to yield them and the toun^ sauf there lives and their goods / Then^e they
chese twayn of the most noble knights of the cite and most propice to the
erande. And sent hem unto the noble king Eson / that made with all diligence
his things ready for tassaile the cite in many places. and when they were comen
to fore him and salutaco^n made / they told him first that the queen her lady
was deed and putt in sepulture. Secondly they said to him that Jason was goon^
out of the cite and wyste not into what place / Thirdly that the cite was
with^oute lorde^ And fynably they said to him / that fortune was such to them
that they of the cite demanded but pees / and that they were content to
constitute him king upon them by condition that he should not touch their
lives ne meuable goods what som^e ever they were

When the noble king Eson of myrmidone understood that his sone Jason was so
departed / he was right sorrowful in his courage. but touching thoffres of the
Inhabitan^s and dwellars of the Cite of Oliferne^ he hadd Regard and used to
hem his mercy / For in feat he accorded to them of Oliferne all that they had
putt in terms Then^e he made to cesse thassault. And syn disposed him for
tentre honorably into the cite of Oliferne^ And hit was not long after when
they of the Cite received him into their Cite and in the palais as their king
and gaf him the crown upon his heed. and made all to him hommage and feaulte.
And by this way was king eson king of Oliferne and of Myrmidone / After these
things done and accomplisshed. he sent many knights after his sone Jason for
to seche and find him. but they lost their time / for they returned unto their
lord without reporting tydinges of him. for Jason went riding fro country to
country by many Iourneyes where he had plente of meruaillous adventures. which
were to long to reherce Of whom the end was such when he had long time erred ^
trauailled in the world he was in great desire to come and see the king his
fader and cry him mercy. for asmoche as he had disobeyed his com^andement and
mesprised against him / whereof he was right sore repentan^t

Upon this conclusion the noble and valian^t prince Jason put him on the way
so far that he came in to Thessaille. But that more is. fortune made him enter
in to the wood where as Medea hadd long ben and soiourned How well she ete
nothing but akehornes and notes^ herbs and roots. And he was constrained one
night to logge him self in the litil logge where medea abode and made her
Residence / And so he found her on a day in his way at the son going down.
Anon as Jason and medea saw each other forth^with^ they knew each other.
With that medea began strongly to wepe^ and syn knelid down on both her knees
in great humylite tofore Jason requiring and cryeng him mercy. Then^e the
knight had pity on her and releued and took her up by the handes^ and syn
demanded her if she had any thing to ete or drink / sayyng that he had honger
and that he hadd not that day eten ne dronken / Then^e Medea made him sit
upon the earth for to rest him a litill. and syn went and fette him of the
notes akehornes and roots and other small fruytes that she had gadred in the
wood. and said to him that he should make good cheer with such as he found.
And that syth^ a certain time that she had been there / she had eten none other
mete

When Jason which was a much virtuous prince had understand the lady and
knew her great poute / he began to remember of the innumerable good deeds
that she had done for him tofore^ and how she had for his love abandonned her
fader and her naco^n for to goo with him / And also that she was of a noble
house as daughter of a king / he took her by the hand and said that he
pardon^ed her of al thing that she had trespaced or mesprised against him. And
in feat said that his plaisir was that she should be his wife again as she had been tofore / Certes Medea incontinent as she understood the good will of her
lord / she was more Joyous in her courage then^e if he had given to her the
best and the most noble royaume of the world. And then^e she swear to him and
auowed that she should never meddle more with sorts ne enchantements ne none
other malefices ne of any thing but first he should have the cognoissau^ce and
knowlech^ / and in such wise she conduysed her self anenst Jason that in that
same time they reconcilled hem self to gyder. And on the morn^ erly Medea
abandonned her lytill logge / And went both on their way. And so far erred
by their Iourneyes that they came unto the court of the king Eson of Myrmidone
that was newly comen in his royaume. Then^e the king Eson knowing their
reconsiliacion contented him self with Jason in pardonyng him all old Rancour
and maletalents / And hit was not long after that the king Eson resigned in the
hands of his sone the Royaume of Myrmidone^ for the great love that he had
unto the fair Medea as he well shewde. For Incontinent that he knew that she
was arrived in his palace. he received her the most ho^ourably that was in ^im
possible to do / And thus the preu Jason and Medea reg^ed and gouned their
Royame hy^ly long time / During the which they lived to gyder in great love
and concord and had many fair children to gyder that reigned after hem of whom
