Note. None of the Danish Horse or Foot are here particularly incerted, which
are 6000 Foot and 1000 Horse.

Colonel Owsley, (since his Shot upon the Belly, and upon recovery) sent out a
Detachment of his Horse seventeen miles into the Irish Quarters (beyond our
Frontiers) who upon Sunday 18 Instant put to flight the Irish, and brought back
Fourhunder'd Black Cattle, Three hundred Sheep and Lambs, and Eighty Horse,
whereof about Twenty fit to serve for Dragoons.

An Intelligence from Dublin informs, that the French have begun to Fire the
Suburbs, in order to make the City more defensive, and less obnoxious to our
Incursions and Bombs. It Is believed they will burn every place they desert, on
design to prevent our Winter Quarters near them in Houses, and to enforce us to
encamp, whereby the cold Weather might destroy our Army.

At present all Affairs wait the Kings Arrival, (which God grant safe and
speedy,) and then a method of marching will soon follow.

The Quarters of the Army uncertain, being every day rolling, and much
scattered.

Note, Tho each Troop and Company are said to have the foregoing Numbers. of
Men, yet few or none are full; neither have they Arms for near the Number, and
many are armed with Scythes

The French Recruits, Landed this Spring, are not incerted.

But it is observable, That the Irish and French cannot march into Field with
this Number, nor Encamp, because by all reasonable Conjecture, their Garrisons
will require, VIZ. Dublin 7000. Drogheda 3000. Cork 1000 Kingsail 3000.
Limerick 2000. Galway 2000. Athlone 2000.

Also their Policy is to defer the War upon a Defense; hoping the Brass Pay
will exhaust the English Current Coin.

The Keys of Dublin are in French Hands: The Bomb-Carts and Carriages Painted
with Flower de Luces. So that the Distinction is not so much William and James,
as England and France, or Protestant and Papist.
