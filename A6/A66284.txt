By the King and Queen, A PROCLAMATION For a General FAST.
Marie R.

THeir Majesty's taking into most serious Consideration the great War, in which
Their Majesty's (together with most of the Princes and States of Europe) are
engaged, against the French King; And that upon the Success thereof the common
Safety of this Realm does, under God, wholly depend; And putting Their Trust in
Almighty God, that he will vouchsafe a special Blessing on Their Majesty's
Righteous Undertaking, and thereby consummate the Deliverance of these
Kingdoms: Have thought fit to Appoint, and do, by and with the Advice of Their
Privy Council, hereby Appoint and Command a General and Public Fast and
Humiliation, to be Observed throughout this Realm of England, Dominion of
Wales, and Town of Berwick upon Tweed, in most Devout and Solemn manner, for
Supplicating Almighty God for Pardon of our Sins, and Imploring his Blessing
and Protection in the Preservation of Their Majesty's Sacred Persons, and
Prosperity of Their Arms both at Land and Sea, to be Religiously Kept and
Observed on Wednesday the Nine and twentieth Day of this Instant April, and
from thenceforth on the Third Wednesday of every Month during the present War.
And for the more orderly Solemnizing of the said several Fast-Days, Their
Majesty's have given Directions to the Right Reverend the Bishops of this
Kingdom to Compose a Form of Prayer suitable to this Occasion, to be Used in
all Churches and Chapels, and other Places of Public Worship; And have given
Charge for the Dispersing thereof through their several Diocesses in the whole
Kingdom. And Their Majesty's do most expressly Charge and Command, That the said
Fastings and Prayers be Soberly, Reverently and Decently Performed by all Their
Loving Subjects, as they tender the Favor of Almighty God, and upon pain of
such Punishments, as Their Majesty's can justly Inflict upon all such as shall
Contemn or Neglect so Religious a Work.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Ninth Day of April, 1691. In the Third
Year of Our Reign.
