only of such Members as shall be Resident in or near Our Cities of London and

only Meet upon the said Sixth day of November next, but shall Sit for the
Dispatch of diverse Weighty and Important Affairs, We do therefore hereby Charge
and Require all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Knights, Citizens and
Burgesses of the House of Commons to give their Attendance at Westminster on
the said Sixth day of November accordingly.
