A book newely translated out of Latin in to Englisshe / called The following of
Christ, with the Golden epistel of saint Barnard.



The introductyon.
HEre after folowethe a book called in latin (Imitacio Christi that is to say
in English / The foloweynge of Christ / wherein be contained four little books
/ which book as some me^ afferme was first made and compyled in ^atyn by the
famous clerk master Johan Gerson Chau^cellour of Paris. And the said four
books he now of late newely translated in to English in such manner as here
after apperyth / and though.iii. of the first books of the said iiii. books
have be^ before this time right well and devoutly translated in to english by
a famous clerk called master William Atkynson which was a doctor of
diuynyte. yet for as much as the said translatour for some cause him moving i^
diverse places lift out much part of some of the chapytres / and sometime
varyed fro the letter as in the.iii. chapitre and in the.xviii. and.xix.
chapitre of the first book / and also in diverse other chapitres of the
said.iii. books will appear to the^ that will examyn the latyne and the said
first tra^slacyon to gyder / therefore the said.iii. books be eftesones
translatyd in to English in such manner as here after follows / to ye intent
that they that list may at their pleasure be occupied with the one / or with
the other after as their deuocyo^ shall styre the^ to when they have seen them
both. And after the said.iii. books follows the.iiii. book which was first
translated out of French i^ to english by the right noble and excellent
princes Margarete late countess of Richemou^t and De^by mother unto the noble
prince of blessed memory king Henry ye.vii. father unto our sovereign lord the
king that now is king Henry the.viii. And for as much as it was tra^slatyd by
the said noble pryncesse out of french it could not follow the latin so
nyghe ne so dyrectly as if it had been translated out of latin. And therefore it
is now translated also out of latin / and yet nevertheless it keeps the
substance and the effect of the first tra^slacio^ out of french though
sometime it vary i^ words as to the reders will appear. And in the later end
after the.iiii. book is a short and devout moral doctrine which is called the
spyrytuall glass of the soul. And it is right good and profitable to every
person often times to look upon it.

Here ends the introduccion And here after follows the Imytacyon of Christ.
Of the Imytacion or ^olowynge of Christ / and of the despysynge of all
vanyties of the world. The first Chapitre.
HE that follows me says Christ our Sauyoure walks not in derkenes / but
he shall have the light of life / these be the words of our lord Jesus
Christ: whereby we be admonysshed and warned that we shall follow his teachynges
and his manner of living: if we will truly be illumyned and be delyueryd from
all blyndnes of heart. Let all the study of our heart be therefore from
hensforthe to have our meditacion holly fired in the life / and in the holy
teaching of Jesus christ: for his techynges are of more virtue and of more
ghostly strength tha^ are the techynge of al angels and saints. And he that
through grace might have the inner eye of his soul / opened i^ to the
sothfaste beholdynge of the gospelles of Christ / should find in them (Ma^na)
yt is to say spiritual fode of the soul. But it is often times seen that some
persons which often here the gospelles of Criste: have little swetnes theri^ /
and that is for they have not the spirit of Christ. Wherefore: if we will have
the true understanding of Cristes gospelles we must study to conform our
life to his life as nighe as we can. What avails it a man to reason high
secret mysteries of the Trynite if he lack mekenes whereby he displeases the
Trinite: truly nothing / for high curious reasons make not the man holy nor
right wise. But a good life makes him beloved with god / I had lever feel
compunction of heart for my sins / tha^ only to know the diffinicion of
compu^ction. If thou could all the Bible with out the book* and also seynges
of all Philosophers by heart what should it profit the without grace and
charity. All that is in this world is vanyte: but to love god and only to
serve him. This is the most noble and the most excellent wisdom that may be
in any creature / by dispysyng of this world / to draw daily nerer and nerer
to the kingdom of heaven. It is therefore a great vain / to labor mordinatly
/ for wordely riches that shortly shall peryshe and to coueyte honor / or any
other inordynate pleasures or fleshely delytes in this life whereby a man after
this life shall be sore and grievously punyshed. How great a vanyte is it also
to desire a long life and little to care for a good life / to hide things
present: and not to provide for things that are to come / to leave things that
shortly shall pass away / and not to haste thither where is Joy
everlasting. Also have this common proverb often in thy mind that the eye is
not satisfied ne fully pleased with the sight of any bodily thing / ne the
ear with herynge. And therefore study to withdraw the love of thy soul from
all things that been visyble and turn it to things that be inuysyble. For
they that follow their sensualyte hurt their own conscience / and lose the
grace of god.

:Against vain seculer co^nynge and of a meke knowing of our self. The.ii.
Chapter.
EVery man naturally desyrethe to know: but what avail the knowledge without
the dread of god. A meke Husbandman that seruethe god is more acceptable to
him / than is a curyouse Philosopher which considering the course of heaven /
wylfully forgets him self: he that well knows him self is vile and
obiecte in his own syghte and has no delight in the vain praysynges of man /
if I knew all things that be in this world without charity / what should it
avail me before god that iugethe every man after his deeds / let us therefore
c^sse fro the desire of such vain knowledge / for ofte^tymes is found therein
great dystracyon and deceyte of the enemy whereby the soul is much hindrede
and let from the perfyte and true love of god. They that have great conning
desire commonly to be seen and to be beholde^ wise in the world / and there be
many things that the knowing of them bring but little profit and little
^rute to the soul / and he is very unwise that takes head to any other thing
tha^ to that / that shall profit him to the health of his soul words feed not
the soul / hut a good life refressheth the mind / and a clean conscye^ce
brings a man to a ferme and a stable trust in god. The more co^nyng thou
haste / if thou live not thereafter / the more grievously shall thou therefore be
iuged for the mysusynge thereof. Therefore rise not thy self in to pride for any
craft or co^ni^g that is given unto the but have therefore the more fear and
dread in thy heart / for certain it is that thou must hereafter yield
therefore the strayter account / if thou think that thou knoweste many things
and haste great co^nynge / yet know it for certain that there be many mo
things that thou know not. And so thou may not ryghtwysely think thy
self co^ning / but ought rather to confess thine ygnoraunce and
uncunning: why will thou prefer thy self in conning before other / sithe
thereby many other more excellent and more conning than thou / and better
learned in the law? if thou will any thing learn and know profytablye to the
health of thy soul / learn to be unknown and be glade to be holden vile and
naught and uncunning as thou art. The most high and the most profitable
co^nynge is this. A man to have a sothfaste knowledge / and a full despysynge of
him self. Also a man not to presume of him self / and always to judge and to
think well and blessedly of other / is a sign and a token of great wisdom
and of great perfection and singular grace / if thou se any person syne or
committee any great crime openly before the / yet judge not thy self to be
better tha^ he. For thou know not how long thou shall persevere in goodness
we be al frail but thou shalt judge no man more frail than thy self.

Of the teaching of truth. The.iii. Chapitre.
HAppy and blessed is that person whom truth teaches / and enformeth not by
fygures / or by deceytfull voices but as the truth is / our oppinyo^ and our
wit many times deceyueth us / For we se not the truth / what avails us
the knowledge of such things as shall neither help us at the day of Judgment
if we know the^ nor hurt us if we know them not. It is therefore great folly
to be neglygent in such things as be profitable and necessary to us / and to
labor for such things that be but curyous and dampnable. Truly if we do so
we have eyes but we se not / and what avails us the knowledge of the kind
and werkynge of creatures truly nothing / he to whom the everlasting word
that is Jesus speaks: is dyscharged of many vain opynyo^s / and of that word
all things proceed and all things openly show / cry and belyue that he is
god. No man without him understands the truth ne ryghtfully iugeth / but he
to whom all things is one and he that all things draws i^ to one and all
things sets in one / and desires nothing / but one may anon be stablyd
i^ heart and be fully pacifyed in god. O truth that God art / make me one
with the in perfyte charity / for all that I read / hear / or see / without the
is a grievous thing to me for in the is all that I will or may desire / Let all
Doctors be still in thy presence: and let all creatures keep the^ in silence
and thou only lord speak to my soul. The more that man is onede to the / and
the more that he is gathered together i^ the / the more he vndsta^deth with out
labor high secret mysteries / for he has resceyued from above the light of
understanding. A clean / pure and a stable heart is not broken ne lyghtely
overcome with ghostly labors / for he does all thing to the honor of god /
and for he is clearly mortified to him self / therefore he coueyteth to be fre
fro following his own will. What hyndreth the more than thy affeccions not
fully mortysied to the will of the spirit / truly nothing more. A good
devout man so ordreth his outward besynes that it draw not him to the love
of it / but that he compel it to be obedient to the will of the spirit and to
the right judgment of reason. Who has a strenger battle: tha^ he that
labors for to overcome him self / and that should be our daily labor and
our daily desire to overcome our self / that we may be made strengers in
spirit / and increase daily from better to better. Every perfeccion in this
life has some imperfeccion annexed unto it / and there is no knowing i^ this
world but that it is mixte with some blyndnes of ygnorau^ce. And therefore a
meke knowing of our self is more syker way to god / than is the serchyng for
hyghnes of conning. Conning well ordered is not to be blamed for it is good
and comes of god / but a clean conscience and a virtuous life is much better
and more is to be desired / because some men study to have co^nynge rather than
to live well. Therefore they arre many times and bring forth little good fruit or
none. O if they would be as busye to avoid sin and to plant virtues in their
souls / as they be to move questions: there should not be so many evil
things seen in the world / ne so much evil example given to the people / ne
yet so much dyssolate living in religion. At the day of Judgment it shall not
be asked of us what we have red but what we have done ne how well we have said
but how religiously we have lived. Tell me now where be all the great clerks
and famous doctors whom thou have well known. Wha^ they lived they
flourisshed greatly i^ their lernyng / and now other men occupy their
prebendes and promocio^s and I can not tell whether they think any thing on
them. In their life they were holden great in the world / and now is little
spekyng of them. O how shortly passes away the glory of this world with all
the false deceyuable pleasures of it / would to God their life had accorded well
with their learning / for than had they well studied and read / how many
peryshe daily i^ this world by vain co^nynge that care little for a good life
/ ne for the service of god. And because they desire rather to be great i^ the
world tha^ to be meke / therefore they vanysshe away in their learning as
smoke in the heir. Truly he is great / that has great charity: and he is
great that is little i^ his own sight and that sets at naught al worldly
pleasures as vile dunge / so that he may win Christ. And that person is very
well taught that forsakes his own will and follows the will of god.

That light credence is not to be given to words. The.iiii. Chapitre.
IT is not good lyghtely to believe every word / or instyncte that comes /
but the thing is auysedly and leasurely to be co^sydered / and ponddred that
almighty god be not offended thoroughe our lyghtnes. But alas for sorrow we be
so frail that we anon believe of other evil sooner tha^ god: But nevertheless
parfyte men be not so light of credence / for they know well that the
frayltye of man is more prone to evil tha^ to good and that it is in words
very unstable. It is therefore great wisdom not to be hasty i^ our deeds / ne
to trust much in our own wits / nor lyghtely to believe every tale / nor to
show anon to other all that we hear or believe. Take al way counseyle of a
wise man and coueite rather to be instructed and to be ordered by other than to
follow thine own inue^cyon / a good life makes a man wise against god and
instructs him in many things that a sinful man shall never feel ne know.
The more meke that a man is in him self and the more obedient that he is to
god / ye more wise and the more please full shall he be in every thing that he
shall have to do.

Of the redynge of holy scripture. The.v. chapter.
Charity is to be sought i^ holy scripture / and not eloquence / and it should
be red with the same spyryte that it was first made: we ought also to seek
in holy Scripture ghostely profit / rather than curyositie of style / and as
gladly shall we read simple and devout books of high learning and conning /
let not the authority of thine auctoure myslyke the / whether he were of great
conning or little / but that the love of the very pure troth styre the to read
Ask not who said this: but take good head what is said: Men pass lightly
away / but the troth of god ever abides. Almighty god speaks to us in his
scripture in diverse manners without accepting of persons / but our curyosyte
often lets us in redynge of scripture when we will reason and argue things
that we should mekely and simply pass over / if thou wylt profit by redynge
of scripture read mekely simply and faithfully and never desire to have thereby
the name of conning. Ask gladly and here mekely the saying of saints: and
myslyke the not the parables of ancient fathers / for they were not spoken
without great cause.

Of inordinate affeccyons. The.vi. Chapitre.
When a man desires any thing inordinatly: forth with he is inquyet in him
self. The proud man / and the covetous man never have rest: but the meke man
and the pore in spirit lives in great abundau^ce of rest and peace. A man
that is not yet mortifyed to him self / is lightly tempted and ouercomme in
little and small temptacyons. And he that is weyke in spyryte / and is yet
somewhat Carnal and inclyned to sensyble things may hardely withdraw him
self from wordly desires. And therefore he has often great grefe and heaviness
in heart when he withdraws him from them. And he dysdayneth anon if any man
resyste him / and if he opteyne that he desires: yet he is inquyeted with
grudge of conscience for he has followed his passion which nothing helps to
gettinge of the peace that he desired. Than by resystynge of passions is gotten
the very true peace of heart and not by following of the^ / there is therefore
no peace i^ the heart of a Carnal man / Nor in the heart of a man that gives
him self all to outward things / but in the heart of a ghostly man or woman
which have their delight in god / is found great peace and inward quyetnes.

That vain hope and elacyon of mind are to be fled and avoided. The.vii.
Chapter.
HE is vain that puttethe his trust in man or in any creature be not ashamed
to serve other for the love of Jesus Christ / and to be pore i^ this world for
his sake / trust not i^ thy self / but al thy trust set in god / do that in
the is to please him: and he shall well help forth thy good will. Trust not
in thine own conning: ne yet in the conning or policye of any creature
living but rather in the grace of god which helps meke persons / and those
that presume of them self he sufferethe to fall till they be meke / gloryfye
not thy self in thy riches nor in thy worldely friends for that they be mighty
/ but let al thy glory be in god only that gives all things / and that
desires to give him self above al things. Exalte not thy self for te
largenes or fayrenes of body / for with a little syckenes it may be sone
defoueled / Joy not in thy self for the habylyte / or rydenes of wit left
thou dysplease god / of whose gift it is all that thou haste / hold not thy
self better tha^ other / lest happily thou be thereby impeyred in the sight of
god that knows all that is in man / be not proud of thy good deeds / for the
iugeme^tes of god be other tha^ the iugementis of man to who^ it dyspleaseth
often times that pleases man. If thou have any goodness or virtue in the /
belyue yet that there is much more goodness / and virtue in other / so that
thou may always keep the in mekenes. It hurts not though thou holdeste
thy self worse than any other / though it be not so in deed / but it hurts
much if thou prefer thy self above any other be he never so great a syner.
Great peace is with the meke man but in the heart of a proud man is always
envy and indygnacyon.

:That much famylyaryte is to be fled. The.viii. Chapter.
Open not thy heart to every person but to him that is wise / secret and
dredynge god / be seldom with young folks and strangers flater not rich men
/ and before great men do not lightly appear. Accompany thy self with meke
persons and simple in heart that be devout and of good governance and treat
with them of things that may edifye and strength thy soul. Be not famylyer
to any woman. Couete to be famylyer only with god and his Angels / but the
famylyarite of man as much as thou maiste look thou eschew / charity is to be
had to all / but famylyarite is not expedyent. Sometime it happens that a
person unknown through his good fame is much commendable / whose presence
after lyketh us not so much. We wene sometime with our presence to please other
/ wha^ we rather dysplease them through the evil manners and evil condicyons
that they se and will consider in us.

Of meke subjection and obedyence and that we shall gladly follow the counseyle
of other. The.ix. Chapitre.
IT is a great thing to be obedyent to live under a Prelate / and in nothing
to seek our own lybertye.: It is mochemore suerer way to stand in the state
of obedyence / than in the state of prelacye. Many be under obedyence more of
necessyte than of charity / and they have great pain and lyghtely murmr and
grudge: and they shall never have lyberte and frydome of spyryte till they
holy submytte themself unto their superyoure. Go here and there where thou
will / and thou shalt never find perfyte rest: but in meke obedience under
the governance of thy prelate. The ymagenynge and the chaungynge of places
has deceived many a religious person / truth it is that every man is
dysposed to do after his own will / and beeste can agree with the^ that follow
his ways. But if we will that god be among us: we must sometime leave our own
will though it seem good / that we may have love and peace with other. Who is
so wise that he can fully know all things: truly none. Therefore trust not
much to thyn own wit. But here gladely the counseyle of other. And if
parcase the thing which thou would have done be good and profitable / and
yet nevertheless thou leuest thine own will therein and foloweste other: Thou
shalt find much profit thereby. I have often times herd say that it is more
surer way to here and take counsel than it is to give it. It is good to here
every man's counsel / but not to agree when reason requires it is a sign of
a great syngularyte of mind and of much inward pride.

That we should avoid superfluyie of words and the company of worldly living
people. The.x. Chapitre.
AVoyde the conpany of all worldly living people as much as thou may / for
the creatyng of worldly matters lets greatly the feruoure of spirit /
though it be done with a good intent / we be anon deceived with vanyte of the
world / and in manner are made as thrall unto it: but we take good head. I
would I had holde^ my peace many times wha^ I have spoken / and that I had not
been so much among worldly company as I have be^. But why are we so glad to
speak and common to gyther fyth we so seldom depart without some hurt of
conscience / that is the cause by our co^mynynge to gyther we think to
comfort each other and to refresshe our hertes when we be troubled with vain
ymagynacyons: and we speak most gladly of such things as we most love / or
else of things that be most contraryous unto us. But alas for sorrow all is
vain that we do / for this outward comfort is no little hyndraunce of the
true inward comfort that comes of god. Therefore it is necessary that we
watch and pray that the time pass not away fro us in ydelnes: If it be
laufull and expedient to speak / speak tha^ of god and such things as are to
the edyfying of thy soul or of thy neybours / and evil use and a neclygence
of our ghostely profit / makes us often times to take little head how we
should speak. Nevertheless sometime it helps right much to the health of the
soul / a devout coming of spirytuall things: specially wha^ men of one
mind and of one spyrite in god / do mete and speak and commen to gyther.

The means to get peace / and of desire to profit in virtues. The xi.
Chapitre.
WE might have much peace if we would not meddle with other me^nes sayenges and
doings that belong not unto us / How may he long live i^ peace that
wylfully will meddle with other me^nes busynes / and that seeks occasyons
without fourth in the world / and seldom or never gathers him self to
gether in god / blessed be the true simple and meke persons / for they shall
have great plente of peace / why have many saints been so perfytly
contemplatyue / for they always studied to mortify the^ fro worldly desires
that they might frell with all the power of their heart te^de to our lord But
we be occupied with our passions / and be much busyed with tra^sytory things
and it is very seldom that we may over come any one vice. And we be nothing
quyke to our daily duties / wherefore we remain cold and slow to devotion /
if we were perfytely mortified to the world and to the flesh and were
inwardly puryfied in soul we should anon savor heavenly things and somewhat
should we have experyence of heavenly contemplacyon. The greatest hynderau^ce of
the heavenly contemplacyon is / for we are not yet clearly delyuerd fro our
passions and concupiscens / ne we enforce not our self to follow the way that
holy saints have gone before us / but wha^ any little aduersyte comes to us
we anon cast down therein and turn us ouersone to seek man's comfort. But
if we would as strong men and as mighty Champions fight strongly en this
ghostly battle / we should vndoughtedly se the help of god come in our need /
for he is always redye to help all them that trust in him. And he procures
occasyo^s of such battle to the^de we should overcome and have the vyctorye
and in the end to have the greater reward therefore / if we set the end and
perfectyon of our religyon in these outward obseruances our deuocyo^ shall
sone be ended. Wherefore we must set our axe deep to the rote of the tree /
that we purged from all passions may have a quiet mind. It we would every
year overcome one vice / we should anon come to perfectyon / but I fear
rather yt contrary wise we were better and purer in the beginning of our
conuersyon than we be many years after we were converted. Our fervor and
desire to virtue should daily increase in us as we encreace in age. But it is
now thought a great thing if we may hold a little spercle of the fervor
that we had first / but if we would at the beginning break the evil
inclinacyon that we have to our self and to our own will / we should after do
virtuous works easily and with great gladness of heart. It is an hard thing
to leave evil custommes: but it is more herd to break our own will* But it is
most herd evermore to lie in pain and endlesly to lose the joys of heaven.
If thou ouercom not small things and light how shalt thou tha^ overcome the
greater. Resyste therefore quykely in the beginning thy evil inclynacons: and
leave of hole all thine evil customs lest happily by little and little they
bring the after to greater dyffyculte. O if thou would consydre how great
inly peace thou should have thy self and how great gladness thou should
cause in other in behauynge of thy self well. I suppose verily thou would be
much more dylygent to profit in virtue than thou haste been before this time.

:Of the profit of aduersyte The.xii. Chapter.
IT is good that we have sometime gryeffes and aduersites / for they drive a man
to behold him self and to se that he is here but as in an exyle / and be
learned thereby to know that he ought not to put his trust i^ any worldly
thing. It is good also that we suffer sometime co^tradiccyo^ / and that we be
holden of other as evil and wretched and sinful though we do well and entend
well / for such things help us to mekenes and myghtely defend us from
vain glory and pride: we take god the better to be our Judge and wytnes / when
we be outwardely dispysed in the world / and that the world iugeth not well of
us / therefore a man ought to stable him self so fully i^ god that what aduersyte
so ever befall unto him he shall not need to seek any outward comfort. Wha^ a
good man is troubled or tempted or is inquyeted with evil thoughts / tha^ he
understands and knows that god is most necessary to him / and that he may
no thing do that is good without him. Tha^ he soroweth / waylleth and prayethe
for the miseries that he ryghtfuly suffers. Tha^ it yrketh him also the
wretchydnesse of this life and he coueyteth to be dissolved from this body of
death / and to be with Christ. And tha^ also he sees well: there may be no
full peace ne perfyte sykernes in this world.

Of temptacyons to be resysted. The.xiii. Chapitre.
AS long as we live in this world we may not be fully without te^ptacyon.::
For as Job says temptacyon is the life of man upon earth therefore every man
should be well annenste his temptacyons and watch in prayers that the ghostely
enemy find not time and place to deceive him / which never slepethe but
always goes about^ seeking whom he may devout. There is no man so perfyte ne
so holy in this world / that he sometime ne has temptacyons / and we may
not fully be without them / for though they be for the time very grievous and
paynfull / yet if they be resysted they be very profitable / for a man by
experyence of such temptacyons / is made more meke and is also purged and
i^formed i^ diverse manners which he should never have known / but by experyence
of such temptacyons. All blessed saints that now is crowned in heaven grew
and profyted by te^ptacions and tribulacions and those that could not well
bear temptacyons / but were finally outcome / be taken perpetual prisoners in
hell. There is no order so holy ne no place so secret that is fully without
temptacyon and there is no man that is fully syker from it here in this life /
for in our corrupt body we bear the matter whereby we be tempted that is our
inordinate co^cupyscence wherein we were borne. As one temptacyo^ goth / an
other comes / and so we always have somewhat to suffer / and the cause is for
we have lost our innoce^sy. Many folk seek to fle temptacyon / and they fall
the more grievously in to it. For by only fleing we may not have victory /
but hy mekenes and pacyence we be made stronger tha^ all our enemies / He that
only flees the outward occasyons and cutteth not away the inordinate
desires hid inwardly in the heart shall little profit / and temptacyo^s shall
lyghtely come to him again and grieve him more tha^ they did first by little
and little with patience and with sufferaunce / and with the help of god /
thou shalt sooner overcome temptacyons than with thine own strength / and
importunyte. In thine temptacyon it is good that thou often ask counsel / and
that thou be not rygorouse to no person that is tempted / but be glad to
comfort him as thou would be comforted. The beginning of all evil
temptayons is in constaunce of mind and to little a trust in god. For as a
shype without a guide is driven hither and theder with every storm So an
unstable man that anon leuethe his good purpose in god / is diversely tempted /
the fire proves gold / and temptacyon proves the ryghtwyse man / we know
not many times what we can suffer / but te^ptacyon shows plainly what we are
and what virtue in us. It is necessary in the beginning of every te^ptacyon to
be well ware / for tha^ the enemy is sone overcome if he be not suffered to
enter in to the heart. But that he be resysted / and shytte out as soon as he
profereth to enter for as a bodily medicyn is very late ministered wha^ the
syckenes has been suffered to increase by long contynuaunce / so it is of
temptacyon. First comes to the mind an unclean thought / and after
follows a strong Imagynacyon: and than delectacyon and diverse evil mocyons /
and in the end follows a full assent. And so by little and little the enemy
has full enter for he was not wisely resisted in the beginning / and the more
flows that a man is in resystynge the more weyke he is to resyste / and the
enemy is daily the more stronger against him. Some persons have their
greatest temptacyons in the beginnynge of their conuersyon / some in the end:
and sum in manner all their life time be troubled therewith / and there be many
that be but lightly tempted and al this comes of the great wysdom and
ryghtwysnes of god which knows the state and merit of every person: and
ordeyneth al thyngis for the best / and to the everlasting health and
salvation of his elect and chosen people. Therefore we shall not despyre when
we be tempted but shall the more feruentlye pray unto god that he of his
infynyte goodness and fatherly pity vouche safe or help us i^ every need and
that he according to the saying of saint Poule so prevent us with his grace in
every te^ptacyo^ that we shall may sustain / let us than meke our souls under
the strong hand of almighty god / for he will save all them and exalte all
them that be here meke and low in spirit. In temptacyons and tribulacyons a
man is proved how much he has profyted / and his merit is thereby the great
anenste god / and his virtues are the more openly showed. It is no great
maruayle if a man be fervent and devout when he feleth no grefe* but if he can
suffer pacie^tly in the time of temptacyons / or other aduersyte / and therewith
all can also styre him self to fervor of spirit it is a toke^ that he shall
greatly profit hereafter in virtue and grace. Some persons be kept from any
great te^ptacyons: and yet daily they be overcome through little and small
occasyons / and that is of the great goodness and sufferaunce of god to keep
the^ in mekenes / that they shall not trust ne presume of them self / that se
the^ self so lyghtely and in so little things daily overcome.

That we shall not Judge lightly other me^nes deeds / ne cleue much to our own
still The.xiiii. chap.
Have always a good eye to thy self: and beware thou judge not lightly other
men. In iugyng other men a man often labors in vain often erreth and lightly
offe^deth god / but in iugynge him self and his own deeds he always labors
frutfully and to his ghostly profit / we judge often times after our heart and
our own affeccyons and not after the truth / for we often l^se the true
judgment through our pryuate love. But if god were always the hole intent of
our desire we should not so lightly err in our iugeme^tes / nor so lightly be
troubled for that we be resisted of our will / but commonly there is in us some
inward inclynacion or some outward affection that draws our heart with them
from the true judgment. Many persons through a secret love that they have to
their self work vndescretely after their own will and not after the will of
god / and yet they wene not so / and they seem to stand i^ great inward peace
when things follow after their mi^de: but if it follow otherwise than they
would / anon they be moved with impacience and be right heavy and pensyfe. By
diversities of oppynyons be spro^ge many times dyscencio^s between friends and
neighbors / and also between religious and devout persons. And old custom
is hardly broken and no man will lightly be removed from his own will / but if
thou cleue more to thine own will or to thine own reason tha^ to the meke
obedience of Jesus Christ / it will be long or thou be a man illumined with
grace / for almighty god will that we be perfytely subject and obediente to
him / and that we ascend and rise high above our own will and above our own
reason by a great brennynge love and a hole desire to him.

Of works done in charity. The.xv. chapter.
FOR nothing in the world nor for the love of no creature / no evil is to be
done / but sometime for the need comfort of our neighbor a good deed may be
deferred or be turned in to a another good deed / for thereby the good deed is
not destroyed / but is changed in to better without charity the outward deed
is little to be praised but what so ever is done of charity be it never so
little or never so despisable in ye sight of the worlds it is right profitable
before god / which iugeth all thing after the entente of the doer and not
after the greatness or worthynes of the deed: he does much that much loves
god: and he does much that does his deed well: and he does his deed well
that does it rather for the commynalte than for his own will. A deed sometime
seems to be done of charity and of love to god / wha^ it is rather done of a
carnalite and of a flesshhy love than of a charitable love / for commonly some
carnal inclinacio^ to our friends / or some inordynate love to our self / or
some hope of a temporal reward or a desire of some other profit mouethe us
to do the deed / and not the pure love of charity. Charity sekethe not him
self i^ that he does: but he desires to do only that shall be honor and
praising to god / he enuieth no man for he loves no pryuate love: nor he will
not Joy i^ him self but he coueteth above al things to be blessed in god /
he knowethe well that no goodness begins originally of man / and therefore he
refers al goodness to god of whom al things proceed and i^ whom all
blessed sai^tes do rest i^ everlasting fenicio^ O he that had a little spercle
of this parfyte charity should feel sothefastly in his soul that all erthely
things be full of vanyte.

Of the sufferynge of other men's defautes. The.xvi. chapter.
SVche defautes as we can not amend in our self nor in other / we must
patiently suffer till our lord of his goodness will otherwise dispose. And we
shall think that happily it is so best for to be for prouyng of our pacyence:
without which our merytes are but little to be pondred / Nevertheless thou
shalt pray hertely for such impedimentes that our lord of his great mercy
and goodness vouchesaue to help us that we may pacyently bear the^. If thou
admonysshe any person ones or twyse and he will not take it: strive not
ouermoch with him but committee al to god that his will be done and his honor
in all his servants / for he can well by his goodness turn evil in to good:
study always that thou be pacye^t in suffrynge al other me^nes defautes for
thou haste many things in the that other do suffer of the / and if thou cane
not make thy self to be as thou would / how may thou tha^ look to have
an other to be ordered in all things after thy will. we would gladly have other
perfect / but we will not amend our own defautes / we would ye other should be
straytely corrected for their offenses but we will not be corrected. It
mynslyketh us that other have liberty: but we will not be denied of that we
ask. we would also that other should be restrained according to the statutes /
but we in no wise will be restrained. Thus it appears euydently that we
seldom pondre our neighbors as we do our self: if all men were perfyte what
had we than to suffer of our neygbours for god / therefore god has so ordained
that one of us shall learn to bear another burden / for in this world no man
is without defaute: no man without a burden / no man suffycyent to him self /
nor no man wise enough of him self / wherefore it behooves each one of us to
bear the burden of other / to comfort other / to help other / to inform
other / and to instruct and admonysshe other in all charity: who is of most
virtue appears best in time of aduersite. Occasions make not a man frail but
they show openly what he is.

What should be the life of a true religious person. The.xvii. Chapter.
IT behooves the to break thine own will in many things if thou wylt have
peace and concord with other. It is no little thing to be in monasteries or
in congregacions and to continue there without complaining or myssaynge and
faithfully to persevere there unto the end. Blessed be they that there live well
and make a good end. If thou will stand surely in grace and much profit in
virtue: hold thy self as an outlawe and as a pylgrime here i^ this life / and
be glad for the love of god to be holden as a fool and as a vile person in the
world as thou art. The habyte and ^onsure help little / but the chaungynge
of life and the mortifienge of passions make a person perfyte and true
religious / he that seeks any other thing in religion tha^ purely god and the
health of his soul shall find nothing there but trouble and sorrow / and he
may not stand long there in peace and quyetnes / that labourethe not to be
left and subgect to al. It is god therefore that thou remember often that thou
ca^meste to religion to serve and not to be served. And that thou art called
thither to suffer and to labor / and not to be idle ne to tell vain tales.
In religion a man shall be proved as gold in a furnace and no man may stand
long there in grace and virtue / but he will with all his heart meke him self
/ for the love of god.

Of the examples of holy fathers. The.xviii. Chapitre.
Behold the lively examples of holy fathers and blessed saints in whom
flourisshed and shone all true perfeccyon of life and all perfyte religion. And
thou shalt se how little it is and welnyghe as nothing that we do now in
these days in co^paryson of the^ O what is our life if it be to the^
compayred. They served our lord in hunger and in thirst / in heat / in cold
/ in nakydnes / in labor: and in werynesse / in vygylles and fastings / in
prayours and in holy meditacions in persecucions and in many repreffes. O how
many and how grievous tribulatyo^s suffered ye apostles martyrs / confessors /
virgins and other holy saints that would follow the steps of Christ. They
refused honors and all bodily pleasures here in this life: that they might
always have the everlasting life. O how strayte and how adiecte a life led
the holy fathers in wyldernes: how grievous temptacions they suffered / how
fyersly they were with their ghostly enemies assailed: how fervent prayour
they daily offered to god / what rygourous abstynence they used / how great
zeal and fervor they had to spiritual profit / how strong battle they
held against all sin / and how pure and hole intent they had to god in all
their deeds / on the day they labored and on the night they prayed And though
they labored on the day bodily / yet they prayed in mind / and so they
spente their time always frutefully and thought every hour short for the
seruyse of god / and for the great swetnes that they had in heavenly
contemplacion / they forgete often times their bodily refeccyo^ All richesse
honor dygnytes kinnesme^ and friends / they renounced for the love of god /
they coueted to have nothing of the world and scarsely they would take that
was necessary for the bodily kind. They were poor in worldly goods but they
were rich in grace and virtue: they were nedye outwardly / but inwardlye in
their souls they were replenysshed with grace and ghostly comfortes. To the
world they were alyens and strangers / but to god they were right dear and
famylyer friends. In the sight of the world and in their own sight they were
vile and abiecte / but in the sight of god and of his saints they were
precious and syngulerly elect. In them shone all perfeccion of virtue / true
mekenes / simple obedience / charity / and pacye^ce / with other like virtues
and gracyous gifts of god. Wherefore they profyted daily in spirit and
obtained great grace of god. They be left as an example to all relygious
persons and more ought their examples to stere them to devotion and to profit
more and more in virtue and grace / than the great multitude of dyssolute and
ydele persons should any thing draw them aback^. O what fervor was in
religious persons at the beginning of their religion / what devotion in
prayers / what zeal to virtue / what love to ghostly dyscyplyne / and what
reverence and meke obedience florysshed in them under the rule of their
superior truly their deeds yet bear witness that they were holy and perfyte
that so myghtely subdued the world and thruste it under fode. Now adays he
is occompted virtuous that is no offender and that may with pacyence keep some
little sparcle of that virtue and of that feruoure that he had first. But
alas for sorrow it is through our own slouthe and neclygence and through
lesynge of time that we be so sone fallen from our first feruoure in to such
a ghostely weykenes and dulnes of spirit / that in manner it is to tedyous to
us for to live / but would to god that the desire to profit in virtue slepte
not so utterly in the: that often haste seen the holy examples of blessed
saints.

Of the exercyses of a good religious person. The xix. Chapitre.
THe life of a good religious man should shine in all virtue and be inward as
it appears outward and that much more inward for almyghtye god beholdethe
the heart whom we should always honor and reverence as if we were ever in
his bodily presence and appear before him as au^gelles clean and pure shynnyge
in all virtue / we ought every day to renew our purpose in god / and to stere
our heart to feruoure and devotion: as though it were the first day of our
conuersyon and daily we shall pray and say thus. Help me my lord Jesus that I
may persevere in good purpose and in thy holy service unto my death and that I
may now this present day perfitely begin for it is no thing that I have
done in time paste. After our purpose and after our intent shall be our reward
/ and though our intent be never so good yet it is necessary that we put
thereto a good will and a great deligence / for if he that often times purposes
to do well and to profit in virtue yet fails in his doing / what shall he
do than that seldo^ or never takes such purpose. Let us entend to do the
best we can / and yet our good purpose may happen to be let and hyndred in
diverse manners / and our special hyndrau^ce is this / that we so lightly leave
of our good excercyses that we have used to do before time / for it is
seldom seen that a good custom wylfully broken may be recovered again with
out great spiritual hyndraunce. The purpose of right wise men depends in the
grace of god more than in them self or i^ their own wisdom / for man
purposes but god disposes / ne the way that man shall walk in this world
is not in him self but in the grace of god. If a good custom be sometime left
of for help of our neighbor / it may sone be recovered but if it be left
of through slouthe or neglyge^ce of our self it will hindre us greatly and
hardly will it be recovered again Thus it appears that though we encourage our
self all that we can to do well / yet we shall lightly fail in many things.
And nevertheless though we may not always fulfill it / yet it is good that we
always take such good purpose especially against such things as hyndrethe
us most / we must also make dylygente search both within us and without us /
that we leave nothing inordynate unreformed i^ us as nyghe as our fraylte may
suffer / and if thou can not for fraylte of thy self do thus contynually / yet
at the ^eest that thou do it ones on the day euenyng or morning. In the
morni^ge thou shalt take a good purpose / for that day following: and at
night thou shalt dyscusse dylygently how thou haste behaved the the day
before in word / in deed / and in thought / for in them we do often offend
god and our neighbor. Arm the as christ's true knight with mekenes and
cha^ite agynst all the malice of the enemy. Refrain glotony and thou shalt
the more lightly / refrain at carnal desires. Let not the ghostly enemy find
the all idle but that thou be redynge / writing / praynge devoutly / thinking
/ or some other good labor doing / for the co^mynalte. Bodily exercyses are
to be done secretly / for that that is profitable to one is sometime hurtful to
a another / and also spiritual labors done of devotion are more surely done in
priuite than in open place. And thou must beware that thou be not more ready to
pryuate deuocions than ^o them that thou art bound to by duetye of thy
religion / but wha^ thy duty is fulfilled than add thereto as thy devotion
gives. All may not use one manner of exercise but one in one manner / another
in another manner as they shall feel to be most profitable to them. Also as the
time requyrethe so diverse exercyses arr to be used / for one manner of exercyses
is necessary on the holy day / another on the feriall day / one in time of
temptacyon another in time of peace and consalacyon / one when we have swetnes
in devotion / another when devotion withdrawethe. Also against principal
feasts we ought to be more delygente in good w^rkes and devoutly to call for
help to the blessed Saints that than be worshypped in the Church of God /
than in other times and to dyspose our self in like manner as if we should than
be taken out of this world. And be brought i^ to the ever lasting feast in
heaven. And sithe that bless is yet deferred from us for a time we may well
thing that we be not yet ready ne worthy to come thereto. And therefore we ought
to prepayre our self to be more redye another time / for as Saint Luke
sayethe. Blessed is that servant whom our Lord (wha^ he shall come at the
hour of death) shall find ready / for he shall take him and lift him up high
above all erthly things in to the everlasting joy and bless in the kingdom
of heaven. Amen.

Of the love of onlynes and scylence. The.xx. Cha^iter.
Seek for a conuenyente time to search thine own conscience. And think often
on the benefaytes of God / leave of all curyous things. And read such matters
as shall stere the to co^punccion of her^e for thy sins rather than to read
only for occupyenge of the time / if thou will withdraw thy self from
superfluous words and fro unprofitable rennynges about and from herynge of
rumors and of vain tales / thou shalt find time conuenyent to be occupied
in holy meditacions. The most holy men and women that ever were: flede the
company of worldly living men upon their power / and charce to serve god in
secret of their heart / and one holy man said as often as I have been among
worldely company I have departed with less fervor of spirit than I came /
and that we know well wha^ we talk long for it is not so hard to keep
always silence / as it is not to excede i^ words wha^ we speak much. It is
also more light to be always solytary at home / than to go forth in to the
world and not offend. Therefore he that intends to come to an inward
setting of his heart in god and to have the grace of devotion / must with our
savior Christ withdraw him from the people. No man may surely appear among
the people / but he that would gladly be solitary if he might / ne no man is
sure in prelacy / but he that would gladly be a subge^ / ne none may surely
command / but he that has learned gladly to obey / and none ioyeth truly /
but he whose heart wytnessethe him to have a clean conscience / ne none speak
the surely / but he that would gladly keep silence if he might. And always the
suertie of good men and of blessed men has been in mekenes and in the dread of
God / and though such blessed men shone in all virtue / yet they were not
therefore lift up in to Pride / but were therefore the more delygent in the
service of god and the more meke in all their doings / and on the contrary
wise the surety of evil me^ ryseth of pride and of presumpcion and in the end
it deceyueth them Therefore think thy self never sure in this life whether
thou be religious or seculer / for often times they y^ have been holden in the
sight of the people most perfyte: have been suffered to fall more greuouslye
for their presumpcion / also it is much more profitable to many persons that
they have sometime te^ptacyons / lest happily they think them self ouermoche
syker and be thereby lift up in to pride or run to seeking of outward
consolacio^. Then that they be always without temptacio^s. O how pure a
conscience should he have that would despise all transitory joy / and never will
meddle with worldly business / and what peace and inward quyetnes should he have
that would cut away from him all busynes of mind and only to think on
heavenly things / no man is worthy to have ghostely comfortes / but we have
first ben well execrysed in holy compunccion / and if thou wylt have
compunccion go in to a secret place / and put from the all the clamours noise
of the world. For the prophet Dauyd says Let the sorrow for thy sins be done
in thy secret Chamber / i^ thy cell thou shalt find great grace which thou
may lightly lose without. Thy cell well continued shall ware sweet and
pleasant to the and shall be to the hereafter a right dear friend / and if it
be but evil kept / it shall ware very tedyous and yrkesome to the. But if i^
the beginning thou be often therein and keep it well in good prayers and in holy
meditacyons it shall be here after to the a synguler friend and one of thy
most special comfortes: in scylence and quietness of heart a devout soul
profit the much and lerneth the heed sentences of scripture and fyndeth
there: also many sweet trees in devotion wherewith every night she washed her
nyghtely from al fylthe of sin that she may be so much the more familyer
with god / as she is dysserued from the clamours noise of worldly busynes.
Therefore they that for the love of virtue withdraw them fro their
acquayntaunce and from their worldely friends / our lord with his Angels
shall draw night to them and shall abide with them. It is better a man be
solitayre and well take heed of him self. Tha^ that he do miracles in the
world forgettyng him self. It is also a laudable thing in a relygious
person / seldom to go forth / seldom to se other: and seldom to be seen of
other why will thou se that is not lawful for the to have / the world
passes away with all his concupyscence and deceyuable pleasures. Thy sensual
apetite moves the to go abroad: but when the time is paste what bareste thou
home again but remorse of conscience and unquietness of heart. It is o^^e seen
that after a merry going forth follows a heavy retornynge / and that a glade
euyntyde causes a heavy morning / and so all flesshely joy enters plesau^tly
/ but in the end it byteth and sleeth what may thou se with out thy tell
that thou may not se with in / lo heaven and earth and all the clementes
whereof all erthely things be made / and what may thou else where se under
ye son that may long endure / and if thou might se all erthly things and
also have all bodily pleasures present at ones before the / what were it but a
vain sight: lift up thine eyne therefore to god in heaven and pray hertely
that thou may have forgyuenesse for the offense / leave vain things to them
that will be vain / and take thou head only to tho things that our lord
commands the. Shyt^e fast the door of thy soul / that is to say thine
ymagynacyo^ and keep it warely from beholdynge of any bodily thing as much as
thou may / and tha^ lift up thy mind to thy lord Jesus and open thy heart
faithfully to him / and abide with him in thy Cell: for thou shalt not find
so much peace without. If thou had not gone forth so much as thou haste
done / ne have given herynge to vain tales / thou should have been in much
more inward peace tha^ thou art / but for as much as it delyteth to the here
new things / it be houeth the therefore to suffer sometime both trouble of
heart and unquietness of mind.

Of compunccion of the heart. The.xxi. Chapitre.
IF thou wylt any thing profit to the health of thy soul / keep the always
in the dread of god and never desire to be fully at lybertye / but keep the
always vndersome wholesome dyscyplyne. Never give thy self to no indiscreet
myrthe / for no manner of thing as nyghe as thou may. Have perfyte
compunccyon and sorrow for thy sins and thou shall find thereby great inly
devotion Co^punccio^ opens to the sight of the soul many good thing /
which lyghtnes of heart and vain myrthe / some dryueth away. It is marvel
that any man can be merry in this life / if he consider well how far he is
exiled out of his country: and how great peril his soul daily stands in /
but through lyghtnes of heart / and negligence of our defautes we feel not: ne
we will not feel the sorrow of our own soul / but often times we laughe when
we ought rather to weep and morn: for there is no perfyte lyberty nor true
joy / but in the dread of god and in a good conscience. That person is right
happy that has grace to avoid from him all things that lets him fro
beholdynge of his own sins / and that can turn him self to gody by
inward compunccyon / and he is happy also that auoydeth fro him all things
that may offend or grieve his conscience. Fight strongly therefore against al
sins and dread not ouermoche all though thou be encombered by an evil
custom / for that evil custom may be overcome with a good custom. And
excuse the not that thou art let by other me^ / for if thou wylt leave the
familyaryte with other they will suffer the to do thy deeds without i^pedime^t
Intrike the not with other me^nes goods ne busy the not in great men's causes
/ have always an eye to thy self and dylygently inform and admonyshe thy
self by fore all other. If thou have not the favor of worldely living people
sorrow not therefore: but be this thy daily sorrow that thou behauyst not thy
self in thy co^uersacio^ as it besemeth a good relygious person for to do. It
is much expedient and more profitable that a man sometime lack co^solacions in
his life than that he have the^ always after his will namely flesshely
co^solacio^s. Nevertheless that we have not sometime heavenly co^solacyo^s or that
we so seldom feel them as we do. It is through our own defaute: for we seek
not to have the true co^punctyon of heart ne we cast not fully away from us
the false outward consolacyons: hold thy self therefore vnwordy to have any
consolacyon and worthy to have much trybulacion / when a man soroweth perfytly
for his sins / than all wordly comfortes be paynfull to him. A good man
fyndeth always matter enough why he owes ryghtfully to sorrow and weep / for if
he behold him self or if he think on his neighbor / he sees well that none
lyuethe here without great mysery and the more thoroughly that he may consider
him self The more sorrow he has and always the matter of true sorrow and of
true inly conpunccyo^ is the remembrance of our sins wherewith we be so
bylapped on every side that seldom we may behold any ghostly things. But
if we would more often think on our death than we do on long life no doubt but
we should more fervently apply our self to amendment / and I believe also that
if we would hertely remember the pains of Hell and of Purgatoyre that we
should more gladly sustain al labors and sorrows and that we should not dred
any pain in this world with that we might avoid the pains that are to come.
But for as much as these things go not to the heart and we yet love the
flateringe and the false pleasures of this world / therefore we remain cold
and void of devotion / and often it is through the weykenes of the spirit that
the wretched body so lightly co^playneth. Pray therefore mekely to our lord /
that he of his great goodness give the / the spyryte of compuncyon / and say
with the Prophet. Feed me lord with the bread of co^punccyon / and give me to
drink water of teres in great habundaunce.

Of the considering of the mysery of mankind / and wherein the felycyte of man
stands. The xxii. Chapitre.
A Wretch thou art where so ever thou be / and where so ^uer thou turn the /
but thou turn the to god / why art thou so lightly troubled / for it falls
not to the as thou would and desyrest / what is he that has all thing after
his will / neither thou nor I ne no man living / for none lives here without
some trouble or anguysshe be he King or Pope. Who thynkest thou is in most
favor with god / truly he that suffers gladly most for god. But many
persons weke and feeble in spyryte say thus in their hertes. Lo how good a life
that a man ledeth how rich he is / how mighty he is / how high in auctori^e
/ how great in sight of the people / and how fair and beauteous in his
bodily kind / but if thou take heed to the goodness everlasting / thou shall
well se that these worldly goods and worldly lykynkes are but little worth and
that they be more rather grievous than pleasant / for they may not be had ne
be kept but by great labor and busynes of mind. The felicyte of man
stands not in abundaunce of worldely goods? for the mean is best. And
verily to live in this world is but mysery: and the more ghostly that a man
would be / the more paynfull it is to him for to live: for he feleth the more
plainly the defautes of man's corrupcyon / for why to eat / to drink / / to
sleep / to wake / to rest / to labor / and to serve all other necessytes of
the body is great myserye and great affliccion to a devout soul. Which
would gladlye be fro the boundage of sin that it might without let serve
our lord in puryte of conscience and in clennes of heart. The in ward man is
greatly grieved through the bodily necessites in this world. wherefore the
prophet David desired that he might be delivered fro such necessites. But woe
be to the^ that know not their own mysery and woe be to them that love this
wretched and this corruptible life / for some love it so much that if they
might ever live were though they might porely get their living with
labor and beggyng yet they would never care for the kyngedom of heaven. O
mad and unfaithful creatures are they that so depely set their love on
erthely things that they have no feeling ne taste but in fleshely pleasures.
Truly i^ the hour of death they shall know how vile and how noughty it was
that they so much loved. But holy saints and devout folowers of Christ
hedede not what pleased the flesh / ne what was pleasau^te i^ sight of the
world But all their hole intent and desire they held to things inuysyble and
fered lest by syghte of things vysyble they might be drawn down to the
love of them.: My well-beloved brother / lose not the desire to profit in
spyrituall things / for thou haste yet good time and space. Why wylt thou any
longer dyfferre the time. Arise and now this same insta^te begin and say
thus / now is time to labor i^ good works / now is time to fight in
ghostly battle / and now is time to make amends for trespass passed / when
thou art troubled than is best time to merit and get rewards of god. It
behouethe the to go through fire and water or thou may come to the place of
recreacyon / ^ but thou can full have the maystry over thy self thou shall
never overcome sin ne live without great tedyousnes and sorrow we would
gladly be delivered from al misery and sin / but because we have through
sin lost our innocensy. We have lost also the very joy and felicyte /
wherefore we must hold us in pacyence and with good hope abide the mercy of
god till wretchydnes be ouerpassed: and that this bodily life bechaunged in the
euerlastyge O how great is the frail tie of man that is ever ready and prove
to sin. This day thou art confessed and to morrow thou falleste again. Now
thou purposeste to be way: and intendeste to go forth strongely in good
works and shortly after thou do as thou never had taken such purpose /
ryghtfully therefore we ought to meke our self and never to think in us any
virtue or goodness: for we be so frail and so unstable. Sone may it be lost
throught negligence / that with much labor and specyal grace was hardly
gotten / but what shall become of us in the end wha^ we so sone wax dull and
slow. Sothely sorrow and woe shall be to us if we fall to bodily rest now as
though we were in ghostly sykernes. When there appears not as yet neither
sign ne toke^ of virtue ne of good living in our conuersacyon. Wherefore it
were expedyent to us that we were it again instruct as nouyces to learn good
manners / if hapely there might by that means be found here after any trust
of an amendeme^t and spyrytuall profit in our conuersacyon.

Of the remembrance of death. The.xxiii. Chapitre.
THe hour of death will shortly come / and therefore take heed how ^ou or
d^creste thy self for the common proverb for the common proverb is true: to
day a man to morrow none. And when thou art out of sight thou art anon out of
mind and sone shalt thou be forgotten. O the great dulnes and hardness of
man's heart that only thinks on things present and little prouydeth for
the life to come. If thou dydest well / thou sholdeste so be have thy self in
every deed and in every thought as thou shuldeste this instance dye / if thou
haddeste a good conscience thou should not much fere death. It were better
for the to leave sin than to fear death.: O my dear brother / if thou be not
ready this day / how shall thou be ready to morrow. To morrow is a day
uncertain: and thou canste not tell whether thou shalt live so long / what
profit is it to us to live long / when we thereby so little amend our life /
long life does not always bring us in to any amendment: but often times
encreasethe more sin / would to god that we might be one day well
conuersau^t in this world many rekyne their years of co^uersyon / and yet
there is but little fruit of amendeme^t ne of any good example seen in their
conuersacyon / if it be ferefull to dye peradventure it is more peryllous to
live long blessed be to personns that ever have the hour of death before their
eyes: and that every day dispose the^ self to dye / if thou ever sauest any
man dye / remember that thou must nedely go the same way / In the morning
doubt whether thou shall live till night: and at night think not thy self
sure to live till on the morrow. Be always ready and live in such manner that death
find the not unprovided. Remember how many have dyed suddenly and unprovided:
for our lord has called the^ in such hour as they leest went And when that
last hour shall come thou shall begin to feel al otherwise of thy life
passed / tha^ thou haste done before / and thou shal^e than sorrow greatly that
thou haste been so slow and negligent in the service of god as thou haste
been. O how happy and wise is he therefore that labors now to stand in
such state in this life / as he would be found i^ at his death. Truly
aperfyte dispisynge of the world / and a fervent desire to profit in virtue /
alone to be taught a fruitful labor in works of penance a ready will to
obey / a full forsakyng of our self / and a wylfull sufferynge of all
aduersytes for the love of god / shall give us a great trust that we shall dye
well. Now whylest thou art in health thou may do many good deeds / but it
thou be sick I can not tell what thou may do / for why few be amended
through sykenes / and in like wise they that go much on pilgrymage be seldom
thereby made perfyte / and holy / put not thy trust in thy friends / and thy
neighbors / ne di^^er^e not thy good deeds till after thy does for thou shall
sooner be forgotten than thou weneste / better it is to provide for thy self
betyme and se^de some good deeds byfor the / tha^ so trust to other that
peraue^tur will lightly forget the / if thou be not now busye for thy self
and for thyn ^wne soul health: who shall be busye for the after thy death. Now
is thy time very precious / but alas for sorrow that thou spendeste the time so
unprofitable: in the which thou sholdest win the life everlasting. The time
shall com when thou shal^e desire one day or one hour to amend the / but I
wot not whether it shall be granted unto the. O my dear brother fro how great
peril and dread myghtest thou now deliver thy self / if thou would always
in this ly^e dread to offend god / and always have the coming of death
suspecte. Therefore study now to live so that at the hour of death thou
may rather joy than dread / learn now to dye to the world that thou may
tha^ live with Christ / learn also to despise at worldely things that thou
may than freely go to Christ / chastity now thy body with penance that
thou may than have a sure and a steadfast hope of salvation. Thou art a
fool if thou think to live long* syghe thou art not syker to live one day
to the end / how many have been deceived through trust of long life: and
suddenly have been taken out of this world or they had though / how often
haste thou herd say that such a man was slain / and such a man was drowned:
and such a man fell and brake his neck / this man as he eat his meat was
strangled / and this man as he played took his death / one with fire: an other
with yren: an other with sykenes: and some by theft have suddenly peryshed /
and so the end of all me^ is death for the life of man as a shadow suddenly
slydeth and passethe away / Think often who shall remember the after thy death
/ and who shall pray for the / and do now for thy self all that thou causte /
for thou wotrest not when thou shalt dye nor what shall follow after thy death:
whylest thou haste time gather the riches immortal / think nothing abydingly
but on thy ghostly health. Set thy study only on things that be of god and
that belong to his honor. Make the friends against that time / worship his
saints and follow their steps / that when thou shalt go out of this world
they may receive the in to the everlasting Tabernacles. Keep the as a
pilgrim and as a stranger here in this world to whom no thing belongs of
worldly besynes / keep thy heart fre always lift up to god / for thou haste no
city here long abiding / send thy desires and thy daily prayers always
upward to god / and pray perseuerau^tly that thy soul at the hour of death /
may blessedly depart out of this world and go to Christ.

Of the last Judgment and of the pain that is ordained for syn. The.xxiiii.
Chapitre.
IN all things behold the end / and often remember how thou shalt stand
before the high Judge to whom no thing is hid: which will not be pleased
with rewards: ne receive any manner excuses / but in all thing will Judge that
is ryghtwyse and true. O most unwise / and most wretchyd sinner / what
shalt thou than answer to god / which knows all thy sins and
wretchydnes / sith thou dredest here sometime the face of a mortal man / why
doste thou not now provide for thy self against that day / since thou may
not the^ be excusyd ne defendyd by none other. But every man shall then have
enough to do to answerere for him self. Now thy labor is fruteful / thy
weping is acceptable / thy morning is worthy to be herd and thy sorrow also
is satysfactorye and pourgynge of sins. The pacyent man which sufferyth of
other iniuryes and wrongs / and yet nevertheless soroweth more for their malice
than for the wrong done to him self / has a wholesome and a blessed purgatory
in this world / and so have they that gladlye ca^ pray for their enemies /
and for them that be contraryous unto them / and that in their heart can
forgive those that offend them / and tarry not long to ask forgyuenes. And so
have they also that more lyghtely he styred to mercy than to vengeance / and
that can as it were by a vyolence br^ke down their own will and strongly
resyste sin / and labor always to subdue their body to the spyryte. It is
better now to purge sin / and to put away vice then to reserve it to be
pourged here after / but verily we deceive our self by inordinate love that we
have to our bodily kind / what shall the fire of purgatory devour but thy
sin truly nothing. Therefore the more thou sparest thy self now / and the
more thou foloweste thy fleshly liking / the more grievously shall thou wayle
hereafter / and the more matter thou reseruyste for the fire of purgatory. In
such things as a man most has offendyd shall he most be punyshed the
slothful persons shall be there prycked with brennyng pryckes of iron / and
glotens shall be tourmented with great hunger and thirst. The lecherous
persons and lovers of voluptuous pleasures shall be fulfyllyd with brennynge
pyche / and brymstone / and enuyous persons shall wayle / and howl as does
wood dogs. There shall no sin be without his proper tourment. The proud
man shall be fulfilled with all shame and confusyon / and the coueytous man shall
be pynyd with penury and need / one hour there in pain shall be more geenous
then here a hondreth year in most sharpest penance. There shall be no rest ne
consolacyo^ to dampened souls. But here sometime we feel relefe of our pains
and have sometime consolacyo^ of our fre^des. Be now sorowefull for thy sins
that at the day of Judgment thou may be syker with blessed saints / The^
shall right wise men stand in great co^staunce against the^ that have wronged
them and oppressed the^ here. The^ shall he stand as a judge that here
submittith him self mekely to the judgment of man. Then shall the meke poor
man have great confidence and trust in god and the obstynate proud man shall
quake and dread. The^ shall it appear that he was wise in this world / that
for the love of god was co^tentyd to be taken as a fool and to be despised and
set at naught. The^ shall it also please him much the trybulacion that he
suffered pacyently in this world and all wyckidnes shall stop his mouth. The^
every devout person shall be joyful / and glade and the vnreligyous persons
shall wayle and dread. The^ shall the flesh that has be^ with dyscrecyon
chastysyde joy more Than if it had been noryshed with all delectacyon and
pleasure. Then shall the vile habyte shall clear in the sight of god: and the
precious garments shall war foul and loathsome to behold. Then the poor
cotage shall be more allowed the^ the palayes over gylted with gold. The^ shall
more help a constante pacyente / then all worldly power and riches. The^ shall
meke obedyence be exalted more high the^ all worldelye wisdom and polycye:
and then shall a good clean conscye^ce make us more glad some and me^y / then
the cunning of all philosophye. The^ the dyspysynge of worldly goods shall be
more of valor then all worldly riches and treasure. Then shall thou have more
comfort for thy devout prayeng / then for all thy delycate fedynge. Then
shalt thou also joy more for thy scilence kepyge / the^ for thy long talking
and ianglinge. Then good deeds shall plentyouslye be rewardyde / and fair
words shall little be regarded. Then shall it please more a strayte life and
hard penance here / than all worldely delectacyon and pleasure. Learn now
therefore to suffer the small trybulacyo^ in this world that thou may than
be delyueryd from the greater there ordained for sin. First prove her what
thou may suffer hereafter. And if thou may not now suffer so little a
pain / how shalt thou than suffer the everlasting tourme^tes / and if now
so little a passion make the inpacyent what shall then do the intolerable fire
of purgatory or of hell. Thou may not have two heuens / that is to say to
joy here and to have delectacio^ here / and after to joy also with christ in
heaven. More oue^ if thou had lyuyd always unto this day in honors and in
freshely delectacyons* what should it profit the now if thou should this
present instaunt depart the world. Therefore al thing is vanyte / but to love
god and to serve him / he that louyth god with all his heart / dredyth neither
death / tourmnt judgment ne hell / for a perfyte love makyth a sure passage to
god / but if a man yet delyteth in sin it is no marvel though he dread both
death and hell. And though such a deed be but a thralle dread / yet
nevertheless it is good that if the love of god withdraw us not from sin that
the dread of hell constreyne us thereto / he that s^t^yth apart the dread of
god: may not long stand in ye state of grace / but son shall he run in to
the snare of the fend and lygh^ely shall he therewith be deceived.

Of the fervent amendynge of all our life and that we shall specially take heed
of our own soul health before all other. The.xxv. Chapter.
MI sone be waking and dylygent in the service of god / and think often
wherefore thou art come / and why thou haste forsaken the world / was it not
that thou should live to god / and be made a spyrytuall man / yes trwely.
Therefore styre thy self to perfeccyon for in short time thou shalt receive
the full reward of all thy labors / and from thensforth shall never com to
the sorrow nor dread: thy labor shall be little and short / and thou sha^te
receive therefore again everlasting rest and comfort: if thou abide
faithful and fervent in good deeds without doubt our lord will be faithful
and lyberall to the in his rewards Thou shalt always have a good trust that
thou shall come to the palm of vyctory / but thou shalt not set the in a full
sykerners / thereof lest happily thou war dull and proud in heart: A certain
person which oftimes douted whether he were in the state of grace or not / on
a time fell prostrate in the church and faith thus. O that I might know
whether I should persevere in virtue to the end of my life And anon he hard
inwardely in his soul the answer of our lord saying / what woldeste thou
do if thou kneweste thou shuldeste perseruer do now as thou would do the^ /
and thou shalt be saufe / and so anon he was comforted and committed him
self holly to the will of god and all his doutfulnes cessyd / and never after
would he curiously search to know what should be come of him / but rather he
studied to know what was the will of god against him / and how he might begin
and end al his deeds that he should do to the pleasure of god and to his
honor. Trust in god and do good deeds says the Prophet Dauyd / inhabyt the
earth / and thou shalt be fed with the riches of thy good deeds. But one
thing withdraws many from profytynge in virtue and from amendment of life /
that is an horror and a falls worldely dread that they may not abide the pain
and labor that is needful for the getting thereof. Therefore they shall most
profit in virtue before all other that enforce them self myghtely to
overcome tho things that be most grievous and most co^traryous to the^ For a
man profyteth there most and there wynneth most grace where he most
overcomes him self / and wherein he most mortyfyeth his body to the soul.
But all men have not in like much to mortyfye and overcome / for some have mo
passions then some have. Nevertheless a fervent lover of god though he have
more greater passions then other / yet shall he be more stronger to profit in
virtue than an other that is better manered and that has fewer possyons but
he is less fervent to virtue. Two things help a man much to amendment of
life / that is a mighty withdrawynge of him self from those things that the
body most inclines him to / and a fervent labor for such virtuous as he
has most need of. Study also to ouercom in thy self two things that most
myslyke the in other men. And take away some special plofyte in every place
where soever thou become / as if thou se any good example enforce the to follow
in / and if thou se any evil example look thou eschew it as thy joy
consydereth the works of other / right so and in the same wise thy works be
consyderyd of other O how joyous and how delectable is it to religyous men
devout and fervent in the love of god well maneryd and well taught in ghostely
learning / and on the contrary wise how heavy and sorrowful is it to se them
live inordynately not using to things that they have chosyn and taken them
to. Also how inconuenyente a thing it is a man to be neclygente in the
purpose of his first calling And to set his mind to things that be not
commyttrd to him. Think often therefore on the purpose that thou haste taken and
set before the eye of thy soul the mind of Cristes passyo^ / and if thou
behold well / and delygentely his blessed life / thou may well be ashamyd
that thou haste no more conformed the to him then thou haste done / he that
will inwardely and deuoutely exercise him self in the most blessed life and
passion of our lord Jesus Christ / shalt find therein plentuously all that is
necessary for him so that he shall not need to seek any thing without him. O if
Jesus crucyfyed were often in our hertes and in our remembrance we should
son be lernyd in all things that be necessary for us. A good relygious man
that is fervent in his relygyon takyth all thing well and does gladly all
that he is commanded to do. But a relygyous person that is neclygent and
slothful has trouble upon trouble and sufferyth great anguysshe and pain
on every side / for he lackethe the true inward comfort and to seek the
outward comfort he is prohybyteth. Therefore a relygyous person that lives
without discyplyne is like to fall to great ruin. Also he that in religyon
sekyth to have lybertye and relessynge of his duetye shall always be in
anguysshe and sorrow for one thing or other shall ever dysplease him. Therefore
take heed how other relygyous persons do that be right straytly kept under
the rules of their relygion. They go seldom forth / they live hardly / they
ete poorly / and be clothed grosely / they labor much / speak little /
watch long / rise erly / make long prayers / read often and keep them self
always in some holsom edoctryne. Behold the Chartusyenc^s and the Cysteur and
many other Monks / and Nonnes of diverse relygyons / How they rise every night
to serve our lord / And therefore it were great shame to the yt thou should
wax slow and dull in so holy a warke where so many laud and peayse our
lord. O how Joyous a life were it if we should nothing else do but with heart
/ and mouth contynuelly to praise our lord / now truly if we should never
need to ete / drink / ne sleep but that we might al way laud him and oonly
take to spyrytuell studyes / then were we much more happy and blessed / than
we are now when we are bounden of necessyte to serve the body. O would to god
that these bodily merytes were turned in to spyrytuell refeccyons which al as
for sorrow we taste but seldom / when a man is commen to that perfection that
he sekith not his consolacyon in any creature / then begins good first to
sauer sweet unto him / and then he shall be contentyd with every thing that
comes be it liking or myslykynge. And than he shall not be glad for no
wordely profit be it never so great ne sorry for the wantynge of it for he
has set him self and stablyshed him self holy in god the which is to him
all in all / to whom nothing perysheth / nor dies / but all thing lives to
him and seruyth him without cessynge after his byddyng. In every thing remember
the end and that time lost can not be called again without labor and
dylygence thou shalt never get virtue If thou begin to be neclygent thou
begynnest to be feeble and weyke / but if thou apply the to feruoure / thou
shall find great help of god and for the love of virtue thou shall find
less pain in all thy labors then thou dydest first / he that is fervent
and louinge is always quycke and ready to all things that be of god and to his
honor. It is more labor to resyste vices and passions / then it is to swynke
and sweet bodily labors / he that will not fle small sins / shall by little
and little fall in to greater Thou shall always be glad at night when thou
haste spent the day before frutefully. Take heed to thy self and styre thy
self always to deuocyo^ admonyshe thy self / and what so ever thou do of other
forget not thy self / and so much shalt thou profit i^ virtue as thou
canste break thine own will and follow ye will of god

Here begins the second book of inward conuersacyon. The first Chapter.
THe kingdom of God is within you says Christ our sauyoure. Turn the
therefore with all thy heart to god / and forsake this wretchyd world / and thy
soul shall find great inward rest / learn to despise outward things and
give thy self to inward things and thou shalt se the kingdom of God com in
to thy soul. The kingdom of god is peace and joy in the holy ghost that is
not granted to wicked people / our lord Jesus Christ will come to the and
will show to the his co^solacyons / if thou shalt make ready for him within
forth a dwelling place / and all that he desires in the is withinforth and
there is his pleasure to be. There is bytwyxte almighty god / and a devout
soul many ghostly vysytynges / sweet in word speaking / great gifts of
grace many consolacyo^s / much heavenly peace and wondrous famylyaryte of the
blessed presence of god. Therefore thou faithful soul prepayre thy heart to
Christ thy spouse / that he may come to the and well in ye for he says him
self. Who so loves me shall keep my commandment. And my father and I and
the holy ghost shall come to him and we shall make in him our dwelling place
/ give therefore to Christ fre enter into thy heart: and keep out al things
that lets his enter: and when thou art rich enough and he oonly shall
suffice to the / and than he shall be thy prouyder and defender and thy
faithful helper in every necessyte so that thou shalt not need to put thy
trust in any other without him / man is soon chaungyd / and lightly fallyth
away / but Christ abides for ever and stands strongly with his lover to
the end. There is no great trust to be put in man that is but mortal and
frail though he be right much profitable and also much beloved unto the /
ne any great heaviness to be taken though he sometime turn and be against the /
for they that this day be with the tomorowe may happen to be against the and
may often turn as does the wind put thy full trust therefore i^ god / and let
him be thy love and dread above all things: and he will answer for the and
will do for the in all things as shall be most needful and most expediente for
the. Thou haste here no place of long abydyng / for where so ever thou become
thou art but a stranger and a pilgrim and never shalt thou find parfeyte
rest till thou be fully oned to god / why doste thou look to have rest here
sith this is not thy restyng place / thy full rest must be in heavenly things
/ and all erthely things thou must behold as things transitory and shortly
passing away / and be well ware thou cleue not over much to them: lest thou
be taken with love of them and in the end perisshe thereby. Let thy thought be
always upward to God / and dyrecte thy prayers to Christ contynually / and if
thou may not for frailte of thy self always occupye thy mind in contemplacion
of the godhede? Be than occupied with mind of his passion: and in his blessed
wounds make the a dwelling place / and if thou fle deuoutely to the wound of
Christ's side and to the marks of his passion thou shalt feel great comfort
in every trouble. And shalt little force though thou be openly dispysed in
the world / and what evil words so ever be spoken of the they shall little
grieve the. Our master Christ was despised in the world of all men / and in
his most need was forsaken of his acquayntaunce and friends and left among
shames and rebukes. He would suffer wrongs and benought set by of the world:
and he will not that any person do us wrong ne disprayse our deeds. Christ
had many adversaries and backebytours / and we would have all to be our
friends and lovers. How sh^lde thy patience be crowned in heaven* If no
aduersytye should by fall to the in earth: if thou will suffer none aduersyte:
how may thou be the friend of Christ. It behooves the to suffer with
Christ / and for Christ if thou will reygne with Christ. Truly if thou
had ones entered in to the blody wounds of Jesus: and haddeste there tasted
a little of his love / thou should little care for lykynges or myslykynges of
the world / but thou shuldeste rather have great joy when wrongs and
reproues were done unto the / for perfyte love of God makes a man perfytely to
despise him self. The true inward love of god that is fre from all inordinate
affeccions may anon turn him self freely to god / and lift him self up in
spirit in conte^placion and frutefully rest him in Christ. Also he to whom
all things be esteemed as they be / and not as they be taken and thought to be
of worldly people / is very wise and is rather taught of god tha^ of man And he
that can i^wardly lift his mind vpwardly to god and can little regard
outward things needs not to seek for time or place to go to prayers: or to
do other good deeds or virtuous occupacio^s. For the ghostly man may sone
gather him self together and fyxe his mind in God / for he never suffers it
to be fully occupied in outward things. And therefore his outward labors
and his worldely occupacions necessary for the time / hyndre him not but little
/ for as they come so he applies him self to them and refers the^ always to
the will of god. More over a man that is well ordered in his soul / forseth
little the unkind demeaner of worldly people ne yet their proud behauoure. As
much as a man loves any worldly thing more tha^ it should be beloved so much
his mind is hyndred and let for the true ordynate love that he should have
to god / if thou were well purged from all inordinate affectyons / thane what
so ever should befall to the should turn to thy ghostely profit and to the
great encreasynge of grace and virtue in thy soul / but the cause why so many
things displease the and trouble the / is for thou art not yet parfytely
dead to the world* ne thou art not yet fully severed from the love of erthly
things / and no thing so much defouleth the soul / as an unclean love to
creatures / if thou forsake to be comforted by worldly things outwardly thou
may behold more parfytely heavenly things / and thou shalt than sing
contynually lauds and praysynges to him with great joy and inward gladness
of heart. The which grant the and me the blessed Trynite Amen.

Of a meke knowing of our own defautes. The.ii. Chapter.
Regard not much who is with the: nor who is against the / but be this thy
greateste study that God may be with the in every thing that thou do have
a good conscience and he shall well defend: and who so ever he will help aid
defend there may no malice hinder ne grieve: if thou can be still and suffer a
while thou shalt without doubt se the help of god come in thy n^de he
knowethe the time and place how to deliver the / and therefore thou must
resygne thy self holy to him. It parteyneth to him to help and to deliver
from all confusyon. Nevertheless it is often times much profitable to us for the
more surer keeping of mekenes / that other me^ know our defautes and reprove
us of them. When a man mekethe him self for his offenses / he lightly pleases
other and lightly reconcyleth him self to them that he has offended. The meke
man / almighty god defends and comfort: to him he inclynethe him self and
sends him great plenty of his grace to him: also he shows his secrets and
louyngely he draws him to him / and after his oppressyons he lyfteth him up
to glory. The meke man when he has suffered co^fusyon and reprove / is in
good peace: for he trusts in God and not in the world. Moreover if thou
will come to the hyghnes of perfeccion: think not thy self any thing
profyted in virtue till thou can feel mekely in thy heart that thou haste less
mekenes and less virtue than any other has.

How good it is for a man to be peaceful. The.iii. Chapter.
First put thy self in peace / and than thou may the better pacyfye other
/ a peaceful man and a pacient profytethe more to him self and to other also
/ than a man well learned that is vnpeacefull. A man that is passyonate tourneth
often times good in to evil and lyghtely believes the worse part. But a good
peaceful man tourneth all thing to the best: and has suspeccyon to no man
but he that is not content is often troubled with many suspicious: and neither
is he quiet him self / nor yet suffers he other for to be quiet / he speaks
often times that he should not speak / and he omitteth to speak / that were more
expedient to be spoken: he consydereth greatelye what other be bounden to do /
but to that that he is bounden to him self he is full negligen^e / have
therefore first a zele and a respect to thy self / and to thine own soul /
and tha^ thou may the more right wisely and with the more due order of
charity have zele upon thy neighbors. Thou art anon redye to excuse thine
own defautes / but thou will not here the excuses of thy brethren. Truly it
were more charitable and more profitable to the that thou shuldeste accuse thy
self and excuse thy brother: For if thou will be borne? bear other / behold
how far thou art yet fro perfyte mekenes and charity: which can not be
angrye with none but with them self. It is no great thing to be well
co^uersau^te with good men and with tractable men / for that naturally
pleasethe all people / and every man gladly has peace with the^ and most
loves them that follow their appetite / but to live peacybly with evil men
and with froward men that lack good manners and be untaught and that be also
co^trarious unto us / is a great gracee and a manly deed and much to be
praised for it can not be done but through great ghostly strength. Some persons
can be quiet the^ self and also can live quyetly with other / and some can
not be quiet them self: ne yet suffer other to be quiet / they be grievous to
other / but they be more grievous to them self. And some can keep them self in
good peace / and can also bring other to live in peace / and nevertheless all
our peace whiles we be in this mortal life: standethe more in meke sufferyng
of troubles and of things that be contrarious unto us: than in the not feeling
of the^. For no man may live here without some trouble. And therefore he that
cane best suffer shall have most peace / and it is very true overcome of him
self / the lord of the world / the friend of Christ / and the true
enheritour of the kingdom of heaven.

Of a pure mind and a simple intent. The.iiii. Chapitre.
MAn is borne up from erthly things with two wings / that is to say: with
plai^nes and cle^nes / plai^nes is in the entente / and clennes is in the love
/ the good true and plainne intent looks toward God / but the clean love
takes assaye and tastes his swetnes. If thou be fre from all inordynate love
there shall no good deed hinder the / but that thou shalt therewith increase in
the way of perfection. If thou entente well and seek nothing but god and the
profit of thine own soul and of thy neighbors / thou shalt have great
inward lybertye of mind. And if thy heart be strayte with god? Than every
creature shall be to the a mirror of life and a book of holy doctrine / for
there is no creature so little ne so vile: but that it shewethe and
represents the goodness of god. Also if thou were withinforth i^ thy soul
pure and clean / thou shuldeste than without lettynge take all things to the
best. A clean heart perceth both heaven and hell Such as a man is in his
conscience inwardly / such he shows to be by his outward conversation. If
there be any true joy in this world / that had a man of a clean co^scye^ce.
And if there be any where trybulacyon or anguysshe / an evil conscience
knows it best. Also as iron put in to the fire is cleansed from ruste and is
made all clean and pure / right so a man tournynge him self holy to god is
purged fro slouthfulnes and suddenly is changed in to a new man. When a man
begins to wax dull and slow to ghostlye busynes / than a little labor
fereth him greatly / and that he takes gladely outward co^fortes of the
world and of the flesh / but when he begins perfytely to overcome him
self and to walk strongly in the way of God / tha^ he regards the labors
but little / that before he thought were ryhhte grievous and as importable unto
him.

Of the knowing of our self. The.v. Chapitre.
WE may not trust much i^ our self ne in our own wit / for often times through
our presu^pcion we lack grace: and right little light of true understanding
is in us / and that we have many times / we lose through our negligence / and
yet we se not / ne we will not se how blind we are. Often times we do evil /
and in defense thereof we do much worse / and sometime we be moved with passion
and we wene it be of a zele to God / we can anon repreue small defautes in
our neighbors: but our own defautes that be much greater we will not se /
we feel anon and pondre greatelye what we suffer of other / butte what other
suffer of us we will not consider / but he that would well and ryghtwyselye
judge his own defautes: should not so rygourously judge the defautes of his
neighbors. A man that is inwardly turned to god takes head of him self
before all other / and he that cane well take heed of him self: cane lyghtlye
be still of other men's deeds Thou shulte never be an inward man and a
devout follower of Christ / but thou cane keep the from medelynge of other
men's deeds and can specially take heed of thine own. If thou take heed holy
to God and to thy self / the defautes that thou see in other shall little
move the. Where art thou when thou art not present to thy self / and when
thou haste all run about and much haste considered other men's works.
what haste thou profyted thereby if thou have forgotten thy self: if thou will
therefore have peace in thy soul and be perfytely oned to god in blessed love
set a part all other me^nes deeds and only set thy self and thine own deeds
before the eye of thy soul and that thou see amysse in the / shortelye do
reform it. Thou shalt much profit in grace if thou keep the fre from
altemporal cures / and it shall hyndre the greatly if thou set price by any
temporal things. Therefore let nothing be in thy syghte high nothing great
nothing / lyking ne acceptable to the but it be purely good or of good. Think
all comfortes vain that come to the by any creature / he that loves god and
his own soul for God? dispisethe all other love for he sees well that god
alone which is eternal inconprehensible and that fulfylleth all things with
his goodness / is the hole solace and comfort of the soul: and that he is the
very true gladness of heart / and none other but only he.

Of the gladness of a clean conscience. The.vi. chapter.
THe glory of a good man / is the witness of God / that he has a good
conscience / have therefore a good conscience and thou shalt always have
gladness. A good conscience may bear many wrongs and it is ever merry and glade
in aduersyties / but an evil conscience is always fereful and unquiet. Thou
shalt rest the swetely and blessedly? if thine own heart reprove the not. Be
never glade but when thou have done well. Evil men have never perfyte gladness:
ne they feel no inward peace. For our Lord sayethe: There is no peace to
wicked people. And though they say we be in good peace there shall no evil
come to us. Lo who may grieve us or hurt us / believe them not: for sodeynely
the wrath of god shall fall upon them but they amend / and all that they have
done shall turn to naught / and that they would have done shall be undone.
It is no grievous thing to a feruente lover of god to joy in tribulacyon / for
all his ioy^ and glory is to joy in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ: It
is a short glory that is given by man: and comenly some heaviness follows
shortly after. The joy and gladness of good me^ is in their own conscience /
and the joy of ryghtwyse me^ is in good / and of god / and their joy is in
virtue and in good life he that d^syrethe the very perfyte joy that is
everlasting sets little price by temporal joy / and he that seeks any
worldly joy or does not in his heart fully despise it / shewethe him self
openly to love but little the joy of heaven. He has great tranquylite and peace
of heart that neither regardethe praises ne disprayses. And he shall sone be
pacified and content that has a good conscience. Thou art not the better for
thou art praised: ne the worse for thou art dispraysed / for as thou art?
thou art / and what so ever be said of the: thou art no better than almyghtye
god which is the sercher of man's heart will wytnes the to be / if thou
behold well what thou art inwardly: thou shall not care much what the world
speaks of the outward. Man seethe the face / but god beholds the heart.
Man beholds the deed / but god beholds the intent of the deed. It is a
great token of a meke heart: A man ever to do well / and yet to think him
self to have done but little. And it is a great sign of clennes of life and
of an inward trust in God when a man takes not his comfort of any creature:
when a man sekethe no outward wytnes for him self / it appears that he has
holy committed him self to god. Also after the words of saint Paul He that
commends him self is not justified / but he whom god commends and he that
has his mind always lift up to god / and is not bounden with any inordinate
affeccion withoutforth / is in the degree and in the state of a holy and a
blessed man.

Of the love of Jesus above al things The.vii. Chapitre.
BLessed is he that knows how good it is to love Jesus / and for his sake to
dispyse him self. It behooves the lover of Jesus to forsake all other love
beside him / for he will be beloved only above al other. The love of creatures
is deceyuable and faylinge / but the love of Jesus is faythefull and always
abiding / he that cleuethe to any creatures must of necessyte fail as does
the creature / but he that cleueth abydyngely to Jesus shall be made stable in him
for ever. Love him therefore and hold him thy friend for wha^ all other forsake
the he will not forsake the ne suffer the finaly to perisshe Thou must of
necessytie be departed from thy friends and from all man's company whether
thou will or not and therefore keep the with thy lord Jesus living and dyeng
and commit the to his fydelyte and he will be with the and help the when all
other forsake the. Thy beloved is of such nature that he will not admyt any
other love / for he will have alonely the love of thy heart and will sit therein
as a king in his proper throne If thou could well avoid from the: the love
of creatures: he would always abide with the and never would he forsake the.
Thou shalt in manner find it all as lost what so ever trust thou haste put
in any manner of thing beside Jesus / put not thy trust therefore to such
things as is but a quel full of wind or as a holowe stycke which is not able
to sustain the / ne to help the / but in thy most need will deceive the /
for man is but as hay / and all his glory is as a flower in the field / which
suddenly vanysshed and slydeth away. If thou take heed only to the outward
apparaunce thou shalt sone be deceived and if thou seek thy comfort in any
thing but in Jesus / thou shalt feel thereby great spirytuall loss. But if thou
seek in all things thy lord Jesus / thou shall truly find thy lord Jesus /
and if thou seek thy self thou shalt find thy self / but that shall be to
thine own great loss / for truly a man is more grievous and more hurtful to
him self if he seek not his lord Jesus: than is all the world / and more than
all his adversaries may be.

Of the famylyer frendshyppe of Jesus. The.viii. Chapitre.
When our lord Jesus is present all thing is liking and nothing seems hard
to do for his love / but wha^ he is absente all thing that is done for his
love / is paynfull and hard / when Jesus speaks not to the soul there is no
faithful consolacyon / but if he speak but one word only / the soul feleth
great inward comfort / did not mary Magdalyne rise sone from weeping when
Martha showed her that her master Christ was nyghe and called her: yes
truly.: O that is an happy hour wha^ Jesus called us from weeping to joy of
spirit Remember how dry and how undevout thou art without Jesus / and how
unwise / how vain / and how co^nynge thou art when thou desyrest any thing
beside Jesus. Truly that desire is more hurtful to the: than if thou had
lost all the world / what may this world give the / but through the help of
Jesus. To be without Jesus is a pain of hell. And to be with Jesus is plesau^t
paradyse: if Jesus be with the / there may no enemy grieve the / and he that
fyndeth Jesus fyndeth a great treasure that is best above all other treasures /
and he that leseth Jesus leseth very much / and more than all the world / he
is most pore that lives without Jesus / and he is most rich that is with
Jesus. It is great conning to be well co^uersaunt with Jesus / and to keep him
is right great wisdom / be meke and paceful and Jesus shall be with the / be
devout and quiet and Jesus will abide with the. Thou may anon drive away thy
lord Jesus and lose his grace / if thou apply thy self to outward things /
and if through neglyge^ce of thy self thou lose him what friend shalt thou
than have: without a friend thou may not long endure / and if Jesus be not
thy friend most before al other thou shall be very heavy and disolate / and be
left without all perfyte frenshype / and therefore thou do not wisely if
thou trust or joy in any other thing beside him / we should rather chose to
have all the world against us tha^ to offend god / and therefore of all that
the to be lefe and dear let thy lord Jesus be the most lefe and dear: and
most specially beloved to the above all other / and let all other by beloved
for him: and he only for him self. Jesus is only to be beloved for him self
/ for he is only proved good and faithful before all other friends. In him:
and for him: both enemies and friends are to be beloved / and before all
things we ought mekely wtth all dylygence to pray to him that he may be
beloved and honored of all his creatures. Never coueyt to be syngulerly loved
or commended / for that belongs only to god which has none like unto him /
and desire not that any thing be occupied with the in thy heart / ne that thou
be occupied with love of any creature but that thy lord Jesus may be i^ the and
in every good man and woman. Be pure and clean withinforth without lettynge of
any creature as nyghe as thou can for it behouethe the to have a right clean
and a pure heart to Jesus. If thou will know and feel how sweet he is / and
verily thou may not come to that p^e but thou be prevented and drawn
through his grace / and that all other things set aparte thou be inwardely
kny^e and on^de to him: when the grace of god comes to a man that is he made
mighty and strong to do every thing that belongs to virtue / and when
grace withdraws than is he made weyke and feable to do any good deed / and is
in manner as he were left only to pain and punisshementes.: And if it happen
so with the / despair not ouermuche therefore: nor leave not thy good deeds
undone: but stand always strongely after the will of god / and turn all
things that shall come to the to the laud and praysinges of his name for
after winter comes somer / and after the night comes the day / and after a
great tempeste / shows again tyghte clear and plesaunte weder.

Of the wantynge of all solace and contorie. The.ix. Chapter.
IT is no great thing to dispyse man's comfort when the comfort of god is
present: but it is a great thing and that a right great thing a man to be
so strong in spyryte that he may bear the wantynge of them both / and for the
love of god and to his honor to have a ready will to here as it were a
desolacion of spirit / and yet in nothing to seek him self ne his own
merytes / what proof of virtue is it if a man be merry and devout in god when
grace comes and vysyteth the soul / for that hour is desired of every
creature / he rydeth right saffely whom the grace of god bears and supporteth
and what merueil is it if he feel no bourde^ that is borne up by him that is
almighty and that is led by the sovereign guide that is good himself / we be
always glad to have solace / and consolacyon but we would have no tribulacyon /
ne we will not lightly cast from us the false love of our self. The blessed
martyr saint Laure^ce through the love of god myghtly overcame the love of the
world and of him self / for he dyspyse^ all that was liking and delectable
in the world / and Sixtus the pope whom he most loved for the love of god he
suffered mekely to be taken from him / and so through the love of god / he
overcame the love of man / and for man's conforte he chose rather to follow
the will of god: do than in likewise and learn to forsake some necessary / and
some well-beloved friend for the love of god: and take it not grievously when thou
art left or forsaken of thy friend / for of necessyte it behooves worldely
friends to be dysseuered. It behooves a man to fight long and myghtely to
strive with him self or that he shall learn fully to overcome him self / and
or that he shall freely and redely set all his desires in god. When a man
loves him self and much trusts to him self: he falls anon to man's
confortes: but the very true lover of Christ and the dylygent follower of
virtue falls not so lightly to the^ ne seeks not much such sensible
swetnes ne such bodily delytes / but rather is glad to suffer great hard
labors and pain for the love of Christ. Nevertheless wha^ ghostely co^fortes
is sent to the of god take it mekely and give thankynges mekely for it: but
know it for certain that it is of the great goodness of god that sends it to
the / and not of thy deseruynge / and look thou be not lift up therefore in to
pride ^ ne that thou joy not much thereof ne p^sume not vaynly theri^: but
rather that thou be the more meke. For so noble a gift and the more ware and
the more ferfull in all thy warkes / for that time will pass away / and the
time of temptacyon will shortly follow after. When conforte is withdrawn
dyspayre not therefore / but mekely and patiently abide the visitacion of god /
for he is able and of more power to give the more grace and more ghostely
comfort than thou had first. Such alteracyon of grace is no new thing
/ ne no strange thing to the^ that have had experience in the way of god /
for in great saints and in holy Prophets was many times found like
alteracyon / wherefore the Prophet David says. Ego diri in habu^dancia mea*
no^ mouebor ineternu^) That is to say: wha^ David had habundau^ce of ghostly
comfort he said to our lord that he trusted he should never be removed from
such comfort / but after wha^ grace withdrewe: he said. Auertisti faciem
tua^ a me: and factus sum co^turbatus. That is: O lord thou haste withdrawn
thy ghostly co^fortes from me / and I am left in great trouble and heuines:
and yet nevertheless he dispayred not therefore / but prayed hertely unto our
lord and said.: Ad te domine clamabo et ad deum meum deprecabor / That is to
say I shall busely cry to the lord / and I shall mekely pray to the for
grace and comfort. And anon he had the effect of his prayers as he
witnesses him self sayng thus. Audi^it dominus et misertus est mei dominus
fac^us est adiutor meus) that is to say / our lord has hard my prayer / and
has had mercy on me / and has now again sent me his help and ghostely
comfort. And therefore he says afterward: lord thou haste turned my sorrow
i^ to Joy / and thou haste belapped me with heavenly gladness / and if almighty
god has thus done with holy saints / it is not for us weyke and feable
persons to dyspayre though we sometime have feruoure of spirit and be sometime
left cold and void of devotion. The holy ghost goth and comes after his
pleasure and therefore the holy man Job says. Lord thou gracyously visitest
thy lover in the morrow tide / that is to say in the time of comfort / and
sodeinly thou prouest him that is to say i^ with drawing such comfortes from
him / wherein than may I trust or in whom may I have any confidence / but
oney in the great endeles grace and mercy of god for why: the company of good
mean / ne yt felyshype of devout brethren and faithful friends / ne the
having of holy books or of devout treatises / ne yet the heryng of sweet
songs: or of devout Impnes / may little avail and bring forth but little
comfort to the soul when we are left to our own fraylty and pouertye. And
wha^ we be so left there is no better remedy but pacyence with a hoole
resygnyng of our own will to the will of god I never found yet any religyous
person so perfyte / but that he had sometime absentynge of grace or some
mynysshyng of fervor / and there was never yet any saint so hyghly rauysshed /
but that he first or last had some temptacyon / he is not worthy to have the
high gift of co^templacyon / that has not suffered for god some trybulacyon.
The temptacyo^s going before / were wont to be a sothfaste toke^ of heavenly
comfort shortly coming after And to them that be found stable in their
te^ptacyo^s is promised by our lord great consolacyon / and therefore he says
thus. He that overcomes I shall give him to eat of the tree of life. Heavenly
comfort is sometime given to a man that he may after be more strong to suffer
aduersyties / but after follows temptacyo^ that he be not lift up i^ to pride
and think that he is worthy such consolacyon. The ghostely enemy slepeth not
ne the flesh is not yet fully mortifyed / and therefore thou shall never cesse
to prepayre thy self to ghostely battle for thou haste enemies on every side
that ever will be ready to assail the / and to let thy good purpose all that
they can.

:Of yeldynge thanks to god / for his manyfolde grace. The.x. Chapitre.
WHy sekest thou rest here sith thou art borne to labor / dispose thy self
to pacyence: rather tha^ to confortes / to bear the cross of penance: rather
than to have gladness: what temporal man would not gladly have spiritual
co^fortes if he might always keep the^: for spirytuall co^fortes excede far
worldely delytes and all bodily pleasures / for all worldly delytes be either
foul or vain but ghostely delytes are only iocunde / and honest / brought
forth by virtues and sent of god in to a clean soul. But such confortes no
man may have when he would / for the time of te^tacyon tarieth not long The
false lybertye of will / and the ouermoche trust that we have in our self /
be much contrary to the heavenly visitacyons. Our lord does well in sendynge
such confortes / but we do not well / wha^ we yield na^ all the thanks
therefore to him again. The greatest cause why the gifts of grace may not
lightly come to us / is for we be unkind to the giver and yield not thanks to
him from whom all goodness comes. Grace is always given to them that be ready
to yield thanks therefore again. And therefore it shall be taken from the Proud
man that is wrute to be given to the meke man: I would none of that consolacyo^
that should take from me compunction / ne I would none of that contemplacyon
that should lift my soul in to presumpcion. Every high thing in sight of man
is not holy ne every desire is not clean and pure / ne every sweet thing is
not good / ne all that is lefe and dear to man is not always plesau^t to god /
we shall therefore gladly take such gifts whereby he shall be the more ready to
forsake our self and our own will he that knows the co^fortes that come
through the gift of grace / and knows also how sharp and paynfull the
absentynge of grace is: shall not dare think that any goodness comes of him
felfe but he shall openly confess that of him self he is right pore and naked
of all virtue / yield therefore to god that is his / and to thy self that is
thine: that is to say / thank god of his manyfolde graces / and blame thy
self for thy offenses. Hold in the always a sure ground and a sure foundacyon
of mekenes: and tha^ the highness of virtue shall shortly be given unto the for
the high turn of virtue may not long stand / but it be borne up with the
low foundacyon of mekenes. They that be most great in heaven be lest in
their own sight / and the more glorious they be / the meker they are in them
self / full of truth and of heavenly joy / not desirous of any vain glory or
praysinge of man. Also they that be grou^dely stabled and confirmed in god may
in no wise be lift up in to pride / and they that ascribe al goodness to god /
seek no glory ne vain praysynges in the world / but they desire only to joy
and to be glorified in god and desire i^ heart that he may be honored / lauded
/ and praised / above al things both i^ him self and in all his saints / and
that is always the thing that perfyte men most coueyte and most desire to
bring about / be thou loving and thankful to god for the least benefyte
that he gives the and tha^ thou shalt be the more apt and the more worthy to
receive of him more great benefaites. Think the least gift that he gives is
great and the most dyspysable things take a special gifts and as great
tokens of love / for if the dygnyte of the gyuer be well considered no gift
that he gives shall feme little. It is no little thing that is given of god
for though he send pain and sorrow we should take them gladly and thankfully:
for it is for our ghostely health all that he suffers to come unto us. If a
man desire to hold the grace of god be he kind and thankful for such grace
as he has received / pacyent when it is withdrawn pray he deuoutely that it
may shortly come again / and tha^ be he meke and low in spirit that he
lose it not again through his presumpcyon and pride of heart.

Of the small nombre of the lovers of the cross. The.xi. Chapter.
Jesus has many lovers of his kingdom of heaven but he has few berers of
his Cross / many desire his consolacyon / but few desire his tribulacion: he
fyndeth many fellows at eating and drynking / but he fyndeth few that will be
with him in his abstyne^ce and fasting / all me^ would joy with Christ / but
few will any thing suffre^ for Christ / many follow him to the brekynge of
his bread for their bodily refecyon but few will follow him to drink a
draught of the Chalyce of his passion. Many marvel and honor his miracles /
but few will follow the shame of his cross: and of his other vilanyes / many
love Jesus as long as no aduersyte follows to them / and can praise him and
bless him when they receive any benyfayte of hi^ / but if Jesus a little
withdraw him from them / and a little forsakes them anon they fall to some
great grudgynge / or to over great deieccyon / or in to open desperacyon / but
they that love Jesus purely for him self and not for their own profit nor
commodyte / they bless him as heartily in temptacyon and tribulacio^ and in all
other aduersytes: as they do in time of consolacyon. And if he never sent them
consolacyon: yet would they always laud him and praise him.: O how may the
love of Jesus do to the help of a soul / if it be pure and clean not myxte
with any i^ordinate love to him self truly nothing more: May not they than
that ever look for worldly confortes / and for worldly consolacyons be called
worldly merchants and worldely lovers rather than lovers of god / do they not
openly show by their deeds that they rather love them self than god / yes
truly. O where may be founde^ any that will serve god freely and purely without
lokinge for some reward for it again. And where may be found any so
spyrituall / that he is clearly delivered and byrafte from love of him self /
and that is truly poor in spirit and is holy avoided from love of creatures.
I trow none such can be found but if be far hens and in far countries / if a
man give all his substance for god / yet he is naught and if he do great
penance for his sins / yet he is but little: and if he have great conning
and knowledge / yet he is far from virtue / and if he have great virtue and
bre^ning devotion: yet much wa^teth him / and that is specially one thing /
which is most necessary to him / what is that? that all things forsaken and
him self also forsakyn / he go clearly out from him self and keep no thing
to him self of any pryuate love / and when he has done all that he ought to
do that he feel in him self as he had nothing done ne that he think it not
great that some other might think great: but that he think him self truly
as he is an unprofitable servant. For the auctoure of troth our savior.
Christ says. Wha^ ye have done all that is co^maundyd you to do: yet say that
ye be but unprofitable servants. Tha^ he that can thus do may well be called
pore in spyryte and naked of private love / and he may well say with the
prophet Dauyd.: I am onede in god and am pore and meke in heart. There is none
more rich / none more fre / ne none of more power / than he that can forsake
him self and all passing things / and that truly can hold him self to be
lowest and wyllest of all other.

Of the way of the cross / and how profitable pacyence is in aduersyte.
The.xii* Chapter.
THe words of our sauyoure be thought very hard and grievous: when he says
thus Forsake your self take the cross and follow me. But it shall be much more
grievous to here these words at the last Judgment. Go ye from me ye cursed
people in to the fire that ever shall last.:But to that now gladly here and
follow the words of Christ whereby he cou^ceyleth them to follow him: shall
not than need to dread for herynge those words of everlasting dampnacyon. The
sign of the cross shall appear in heaven / when our lord shall come to Judge
the world / and the servants of the Cross which confirmed them self here
in this life to Christ crucyfyed on the Cross / shall go to Christ their
judge with great faith and trust in him / why doste thou than dread to take
this cross sith is the very way to the kingdom of heaven: and none but that.
In the cross is health / in the cross is life / in the Cross is defense fro
our enemies / in the cross is infusyon of heavenly swetnes / in the Cross is
the strength of mind / the joy of spirit / the hyghnes of virtue / and the
full perfeccyo^ of all holiness: and there is no health of soul nor hope of
everlasting life / but through virtue of the cross. Take therefore the cross
and follow Jesus and thou shalt go in to the life everlasting / he has gone
before the / berynge his cross / and dyed for the upon the cross / that thou
should in like wise bear with him the cross of penance and of tribulacio^
/ and that thou shuldeste be ready like wise for his love to suffer death if need
require as he has done for the. If thou dye with him / thou shalt live with
him / and if thou be fellow with him in pain: thou shalt be with him in
glory. Behold tha^ how in the cross stands all and how in dyeng to the
world lies all our health and that there is no other way to life and true
inward peace but the way of the cross and of daily mortifiyng of the body to
the spirit. Go whether thou will and seek what the list and thou shall never
find about the: ne byneth the / within the: ne without the / more high / more
excellent / ne more sure way to Christ tha^ the way of the holy cross /
dyspose every thing after thy will / and thou shall never find but that thou
must of necessyte so^what suffer either with thy will or against thy will and
so thou shalt always find the cross for either thou shall feel pain i^ thy
body or in thy soul thou shalt have troube of spirit. Thou shalt be sometime
as thou were forsaken of god. Sometime thou shall be vexed with thy neighbor /
and that is yet more paynfull / thou shall sometime be grievous to thy self: and
thou shall find no mean to be delivered / but that it behooves the for to
suffer till it shall please almighty god of his goodness otherwise to dyspose
for the: for he will yt thou shalt learn to suffer trybulacyon without
consolacyo^ but thou may thereby learn holly to submyt thy self to him and by
tribulacyo^ to be made more meek than thou were first. No man feleth the
passion of Christ so effectuously / as he that feleth like pain as Christ
did This cross is always ready and every where it abides the / and thou may
not fle it ne fully escape it where ever thou become for where so ever thou
become thou shall bear thy self about with ye and so thou shalt always find
thy self. Turn the where thou will about the and beneth the: within the and
without the / and thou shalt find this cross on every side / so that it
shall be necessary for the that thou always keep the in pacyence / and that it
behooves the to do if thou will have in ward peace / and deserve the
perpetual crown in heaven / if thou will gladely bear this cross it shall
bear the and it shall bring the to the end that thou desyrest where thou
shalt never after have any thing to suffer: And if thou bear this croste
against thy will / thou makeste a great burden to thy self / and it will be
more grievous to the and yet it behooves the to bear it / and if it happen the
to pull away one cross / that is to say one trybulacyon: yet surely an other
will come and happily more grievous tha^ the first was T^oweste thou to escape
that never yet any mortal man might escape. What saint in this world has been without this Cross and without some trouble. Truly our lord Jesus was not
one hour without some sorrow and pain as long as he lived here / for it
behooves him to suffer death and to rise again and so to enter in to his glory
/ and how it is than that thou sekeste any other way to heaven that this plain
high way of the Cross. All the life of Christ? was cross and marterdome /
and thou sekest pleasure and joy: Thou erreste greatly if thou seek any other
thing than to suffer: For all this mortal life is full of myseryes and is all
beset about and marked with Crosses / and the more hyghely that a man
profyteth in spirit the more paynfull crosses shall he find / for by the
sothfastnes of Christ's lone wherein he daily increases daily appears unto him
more and more the pain of his exyle. But nevertheless a man thus vexed with
pain is not sef^e holy without all conforte / for he seethe well that great
fruit and high reward shall grow unto him by the berynge of his cross: And
when a man freely submits him self unto such trybulacyon / than all the
burden of trybulacyon is suddenly turned in to a great trust of heavenly
co^solacio^. And the more the flesh is punysshed with trybulacion / the more
is the soul strengthed daily by inward consolacion / and sometime the soul
shall feel such comfort in aduersyties / that for the love and desire that it
has to be conformed to Christ crucified it wolbe not be without sorrow and
trouble / for it consydereth well that there more that it may suffer for his
love here / the more acceptable shall be to him in the life to come. But this
workyng is not in the power of man: but through the grace of god that is to say
that a frail man should take and love that his bodily kind so much abhors
and flees / for it is not in the power of man gladly to bear the cross / to
love the Cross / to chastyce the body and to make it burn in to the will of
the spyrite / to ^e honors gladly to sustain reprefes / to dispyse him self
and to coueyt to be dispysed / pacyently to suffer aduersyties / with all
dyspleasures thereof / and not to desire any manner of profit in this world /
if thou trust in thy self thou shall never bring this matter about: but if
thou trust in god / he shall send the strength from heaven / and the world
and the flesh shall be made subject to the: yea and if thou be strongly armed
with faith and be merked with the cross of Christ as his household seruau^te
thou shall not need to fere the ghostly enemy for he shall also be made subject
to the: so that he shall have no power against the. Purpose thy self therefore
as a true faithful seruau^te of god to bear ma^fully the cross of thy lord
Jesus: that for thy love was crucyfied upon the cross / prepayre thy self to
suffer all manner of aduersytes and dyscomodites in this wretched life / for so
shall it be with the where so ever thou hyde the / and there is no remedy to
escape / but that thou must keep thy self always in pacye^ce / if thou desire
to be a dear and a well-beloved friend of Christ: drink affectuously with him a
draught of the chalyce of his trybulacyon. As for consolacyons commit them to
his will that he order them as he knows most expedient for the / but as for
thy self / and for as much as in the is / dyspose the to suffer and when
tribulacio^s come take the^ as specyal co^solacyo^s. Saying with the Apostle
thus. The passion of this world he not worthy of them self to bring us to
the glory that is ordained for us in the life to come. And that is true though
one man alone might suffer as much as all men do suffer / wha^ thou come to
that degree of pacyence: that trybulacyon is sweet to the and for the love of
god is sauoury and pleasant in thy sight / than may thou trust that it is
well with the and that thou art in good estate for thou haste found Paradyse
in earth. But as long as it is grievous to the to suffer and thou sekeste to
fle / so long it is not well with the: ne so long thou art not in the
perfyte way of pacyence / but if thou couldeste bring thy self to that estate
that thou should be at / that is to suffer gladly for god / and to dye fully
to the world than it should shortly be better with the and thou should
find great peace / but yet all though thou were rapte with Paul in to the
third heaven / thou shuldeste not therefore be sure without all aduersyte. For
our savior speking of saint Paul after he had been rapte in to heaven: said
thus of him. I shall show him how many things he shall suffer for me.: To
suffer therefore remains to the if thou will love thy lord Jesus and serve
him perpetually: would to god that thou werte worthy to suffer some what for his
love. O how great joy should it be to the to suffer for him / what gladness to
all the saints of heaven / and how great edifiynge to thy neighbor / all men
commend pacyence / and yet few men will suffer. Right wysly thou ought to
suffer some little thing for god that suffered much more for the world. And
know this for certain that after this bodily death / thou shalt yet live /
and the more that thou canste dye to thy self here the more thou begynnest to
line to god. No man is apt to receive the heavenly rewards / but he have
first learned to bear aduersyties for the love of Christ for nothing is more
acceptable to god / nor more profitable to man in this world tha^ to be glad
to suffer for Christ / in so much that if it were put in thy eleccyon / thou
should rather those aduersyte than prosperyte / for than by the pacient
sufferyng thereof thou should be the more like to Christ / and the more
confermed to all his saints. Our merit and our perfection of life stands
not in consolacyons and swetnes / but rather in suffering of great grievous
aduersytes and tribulacyons For if there had been any nerer or better way for
the health of man's soul than to suffer / our lord Jesus would have showed it
by words / or by examples. But for there was not / therefore he openly exorted
his discyples that followed him / and all other that desired to follow him: to
forsake their own will and to take the Cross of penance / and follow him.
Saying thus,: Who so will come after me: forsake he his own will: take he the
cross and follow he me. Therefore all things serched and red / be this the
fynall conclusyon / that by many tryb^lacyons it behooves us to enter in to the
kingdom of heaven / unto the which bring us our Lord Jesus. Amen.

Here begins the third book Of the inward spekyng of Christ to a
faithful soul. The first Chapter.
IS shall take heed says a devout soul and I shall here what my Lord Jesus
shall speak in me. Blessed is that man which hereth Jesus spekyng in his soul
and that takes of his mouth some word of conforte / and blessed be tho ears
that here the secret rownynges of Jesus and head not the deceytefull rownynges
of this world.: And blessed be the good plain ears that head not the
outward speech / but rather take heed what god speaks and teaches with
inforth in the soul. Blessed be tho eyes also that be shet from sight of
outward vanytes and that take heed to the inward mouynges of god. Blessed be
they also that get them virtues and prepayre them by god daily and ghostly
warkes to receive daily more and more the secret inspiracions and inward
teachynges of god. Also blessed be they that set them self holy to serve god
and for his service set aparte all lettynges of the world. O thou my soul
take heed to that is said before / and shut the doors of thy sensualytes that
are thy v. wyttest that thou may here in wardly what our lord Jesus speaks
in thy soul. Thus says thy beloved.: I am thy health / I am thy peace / I am
thy life / keep the with me / and thou shalt find peace in me / forsake the
love of tra^sytory things: and seek things that be everlasting. What be all
temporal things but deceyuable / and what may any creature help the: if thy
lord Jesus forsake the. Therefore all creatures and all worldely things
forsagen and left: do that in the is to make the pleasant in his sight that
thou may after his life come to the everlasting life in the kingdom of
heaven. Amen.

How almighty god speaks inwardely to man's soul without sound of words.:
The second Chapter.
Speak lord / for I thy servant am ready to here the. I am thy servant /
give me wysdomme and understanding to know thy commandments. Bow my heart
to follow the words of thy holy teachynges that they may distyll in to my
soul / as dew in to the grass.: The children of Israel said to Moses /
speak thou to us and we shall here the / but let not our lord speak to us lest
happily we dye for dread.: Not so lord not so I beseech the / but rather I ask
mekely with Samuel the prophet that thou vouchesafe to speak to me thy self /
and I shall gladly here the / let not Moses ne none other of the prophets
speak to me / but rather thou lord that art the inward inspirour and gyuer
of light to all Prophets / for thou only without them may fully inform me
and instruct me. They without the may little profit me They speak thy words
but they give not the spirit to understand the words. They speak fair / but
if thou be still they kyndle not the heart. They show fair letters / but thou
declarest the sentence. They bring forth great high mysteries / but thou
openest thereof the true understanding they declare thy commandments / but
thou helpest to perform the^. They show the way but thou gyuest comfort to
walk therein. They do all outwardely / but thou illumynest and informest ye
heart within. They water only without forth / but thou gyuest the inward
growyng. They cry al in words but thou gyueste to the here is understanding of
the words that he hard.: Let not Moses therefore speak to me but thou my
lord Jesus that art the everlasting troth / lest happily I dye and be made as
a man without fruit warned without forth and not enflamed within: and so to
have the harder judgment for that I have herd thy word and not done it /
known it and not loved it / byleued it and not fulfilled it. Speak therefore to
me thy self for I thy seruau^te am ready to here the. Thou haste the words of
eternal life speak the^ to me to the full conforte of my soul and give me
amendeme^t of all my life past to thy joy honor and glory euerlastyngly. Amen

That the words of god are to be herd with great mekenes / and that there be
but few that ponder them as they ought to do. The.iii. Chapter.
MI son says our lord hear my words and follow them for they be most
sweet fare passing the wisdom and connyng of all philosophers and of all the
wise men of the world. My words be spiritual and ghostly and can not be fully
comprehended by man's wit ne they art not to be turned ne to be applied to
the vain pleasure of the hearer / but are to be heard in scylence with great
mekenes and reverence and with great inward affeccion of the heart and also in
great rest and quyetnes of body and of soul. O blessed is he lord whom
thou enformeste and teacheste so that thou may be meke and merciful lord
unto him in the evil day / that is to say in the day of the most dreadful
judgment / that he be not than left desolate and confortles in the land of
da^pnacyon.: Than says our Lord again.: I have taught Prophets from the
beginning: and yet I cesse not to speak to every creature / but many be defe
and will not hear / and many hear the world more gladly tha^ me / and more
lightly follow the appetyte of the flesh / than the pleasure of god. The
world promises temporal things of small val^re and yet he is served with
great affeccion but god promyseth his things / and things eternal and the
hertes of the people be slow and dull. O who serves and obeys god in all
things with so great desire as he does the world and as worldly princes be
served and obeyed I trow none. For why? For a little prebende / great
iournayes be taken. But for the life everlasting the people will skarsly lift
their fete ones from the ground. A thing that is of small pryse many times is
busely sought / and for a penny is sometime great strife / and for the promise
of a little worldely profit men eschew not to swynke and sweat both day and
night But alas for sorrow for the goods everlasting and for the reward that
may not be esteemed by man's heart / and for the high honor and glory that
never shall have end. Me^ be slow to take any manner of pain or labor. Be
thou therefore ashamed thy slow servant of god that they be founde^ more ready
to warkes of death than thou art to warkes of life / and that they joy more in
vanyte than thou in troth: and yet they be often deceived that: that they have
most trust in / but my promise deceyueth no man ne leueth no man that
trusts in me without some comfort / that I have promised I will perform /
and that I have said I will fulfill to every person / so that they abide
faithfully in my love and dread unto the end / for I am the reward of all
good men / and a strong prouer of all devout souls: write my words therefore
in thy heart dilygently and often think thou upon them / and they shall be in
time of temptacyon much necessary unto the / that thou understand not when
thou redest it: thou shalt understand in the time of my visitacyon. I am
wont to vysyte my servants two manner of ways / that is to say with
temptacyon and with consolacyon / and two lessons daily I read unto them / one
whereby I rebuke their vices / an other whereby I styre them to increase i^
virtues. And he that knows my words and dispiseth them / has that that
shall judge him in the last day.

A prayer to obtain the grace of devotion. The fourth Chapter.
O Lord Jesus thou art all my riches / and all that I have: I have it of the /
but what am I Lord that I dare thus speak to the I am thy poreste servant /
and a worn most abiecte / more poor / and more dyspysable than I can or dare
say. Behold Lord that I am naught / that I have naught / and of my self I
am naught worth. Thou art only god / ryghtwyse and holy / thou orderest all
thing / thou gyuest all thing and thou fulfylleste all things with thy
goodness / leuyng only the wretched sinner bareyne and void of heavenly
comfort Remember thy mercyes and fill my heart with thy many fold graces /
for thou wylt not that thy warkes in me be made in vain. How many I bear the
miseries of this life: but thy grace and mercy do comfort me therein. Turn
not thy face fro me: differ not thy vysityng of me / ne withdraw not thy
co^fortes from me / lest happily my soul be made as dry earth: without the
water of grace / and as it were a thing unprofitable to the. Teach me Lord
to fulfill thy will / and to live mekely and worthily before the / for thou
art all my wisdom and conning / and thou art he that knoweste me as I am /
and that kneweste me before the world was made / and before that I was borne
or brought in to this life.

:How we ought to be conuersaunte before god in troth and mekenes. The.v.
Chapitre.
MI sone says our lord Jesus / walk before me in truth and mekenes / and
seek me always in symplenes / and playnnes of heart. He that walks in truth
shall be defended from all perils and dangers / and truth shall deliver him
fro all deceyuours and from al evil saynges of wicked people. If troth deliver
the / thou art very fre: and thou shalt little care for the vain sayings of
the people.: Lord it is true all that thou sayeste / be it done to me after
thy sayng: I beseech the that thy troth may teach me and keep me / and finally
lead me to a blessed ending / and that it may deliver me from all evil
affeccyons / and from all inordynate love / that I may walk with the in
fredome of spyrite and in lybertye of heart.

Than troth says again I shall teach the what is acceptable and likyng to me
think on thy sins past with great displeasure and sorrow of heart / and
never think thy self worthy to be called holy or virtuous for no good deeds
that thou haste done / but that thou think how great a sinner thou art
belapped and bounde^ with many fold sins and passions / and that of thy
self thou droweste to naught sone falleste / sone art overcome / sone
troubeled / and sone art thou broken with labor and pain / and thou have
nothing whereof thou may ryghtwysely glorify thy self / but many things thou
haste wherefore thou ought to despise thy self / for thou art more unstable
and more weyke to ghostly works than thou knoweste or may think: Let
nothing therefore seem great to the / nothing precious / nothing worthy any
reputacion / ne worthy to be praised in thy sight / but that is everlasting.
Let the everlasting troth be most lykyng and most pleasant in the above
all other things / and thine own sin and vylete be most myslykynge and
most dyspleasaunte to the / dread nothing so much ne reprove nothing so
much: ne let nothing be to the so much hated / ne fle thou nothing so much
as thy sins and wyckednes / for they should more displease the: tha^ should
the loss of al worldly things.:: Some there be that walk not purelye before
me: for they through pride and curiosyte of the^ self desire to search and to
know high things of my godhede forgettyng them self and the health of their
own souls. Such persons fall often times in great temptacyons and into
grievous sins for their pride and curiosyte / for the which I am turned
against them: and leave them to them self without help or counseyle of me.:
Dread therefore the judgment of God and the wrath of him that is almighty and
discuss not ne search not his secrets / but search well thine own
iniquities. How often and how grievously thou haste offendyd him / and how
many good deeds thou haste neglygantly omytted and left undone / which thou
myghtest well have done. Some persons bear their devotion in books / some in
images / some in outward tokenes and figures / some have me in their mouth:
but little in their heart / but some ther^ be that has their reason clearly
illumyned with the light of true understanding. whereby their affection is so
purged and purifyed from love of erthely things that they may always coueyte
and desire heavenly things: in so much that it is grievous to them for to here
of erthely things / and it is to the^ also a right great pain to serve the
necessytes of the body / and they think all the time as lost that they go
about it. Such persons feel and know well what the spirit of troth
speaks in their souls / for it teaches them to dispyse erthly things / and
to love heavenly things: to forsake the world that is transitory / and to
desire both day and night to come thither where is joy ever lasting. To the
which bring us our lord Jesus amen.

Of the meruaylous effect of the love of God. The.vi. Chapter.
BLessed be thou heavenly Father: The father of my Lord Jesus Christ / for thou
haste vouchedsafe to remember me thy poorest servant and sometime doste
comfort me with thy gra^yous presence / that am unworthy all comfort. I
bless the and glorifye the always with the only begotten sone and the holy
ghost without endyng. Amen. O my lord god most faithful lover / when thou
co^mest into my heart: all my inward parties do joy. Thou art my glory: and
the joy of my heart / my hope and my hole refuge in all my troubles. But for
as much as I am yet feeble in love and imperfect in virtue: therefore I have need
to have more conforte / and more help of the / voutchesafe therefore often times
to vysyte me / and to instruct me with thy holy teachynger / deliver me fro
all evil passions / and help my syke heart from al inordinate affeccyons /
that I may be inwardely healed and purged from all inordinate affeccions and
vices and be made apt and able to love the / strong for to suffer for the /
and stable to persevere in the. Love is a great thing and a good / and only
makes heavy bourden light / and bears in like balaunce things pleasant and
displeasaunte / it bears a heavy bourde^ and feleth it not / and makes bitter
things to be sauoury and sweet Also the noble love of Jesus perfytly prynted in
man's soul makes a man to do great things and styreth him always to desire
perfeccyon / and to grow more and more in grace and goodness. Love will always
have his mind upward to god and will not be occupied with love of the world.
Love well also be fre from all worldly affeccyons that the inward sight of the
soul be not darked ne let / ne that his affection to heavenly things be not
put from his fre liberte by inordinate wynning or lesynge of worldly things.
Nothing therefore is more sweter than love / nothing higher / nothing
stronger / nothing larger / nothing ioyfuller nothing fuller / ne nothing
better in heaven: ne in earth / for love discendeth from god and may not rest
finally in nothing lower than god. Such a lover fleethe high / he renneth
sweftely / he is merry in god / he is fre in soul / he gives all for all / and
has all in all / for he restethe in one high goodness above all things / of
whom all goodness flows and proceeds he beholds not only the gift / but
the gyuer above all gift / love knows no measure but is fervent without
measure* It feleth no burden: it regards no labor / it desires more than
it may attain / it co^plaineth of none inpossibilyte for it thinks all
thing that may be done for his beloved possible and lawful unto him. Love
therefore does many great things and brings them to effect wherein he that
is no lover faynteth and fails. Koue waketh much and fle yet little / and
slepyng? slepeth not / it faynteth: and is not weary: is restrained of lyberte?
and is in great fredome. He sees causes of frre? and fereth not / but as a
quycke bronde or sparkle of fire flameth always upward by feruoure of love in
to god / and through the special help of grace is delivered from all perils
/ and dangers. He that is thus a ghostely lover knows well what this voice
means which says thus.: Thou lord god art my hole love and my desire /
thou art all mine and I all thine. Sprede thou my heart in to thy love that I
may taste and feel how sweet it is to serve the and how joyful it is to
laud the and to be as I were all molten in to thy love. O am bounden in love
and go far above my self for the great wonder feruoure that I feel of thy
unspeakable goodness I shall sing to the: the song of love / and I shall follow
the my beloved: by hyghnes of thought: where so ever thou go. And my soul shall
never be weary to praise the with the joyful song of ghostely love that I shall
sing to the. I shall love the more than my self / and not my self but for
the and all other in the and for the / as the law of love commands which
^s given by the. Love is swyfte / pure meke / joyous and glad / strong /
pacyent / faithful / wise / forberynge / manly and never seeking him self ne
his own will / for when so ever a man seeks him self / he falls fro love /
also love is circumspecte meke / ryghtwyse / not tender / not light / ne hedyng
vain things / sober / chaste / stable / quiet / and well stabled in his
outward wits. And love is subject and obedyent to his prelate / vile and
dispisable in his own sight: devout and thankful to god / trusting and
always hopyng in him / and that when he has but little deuocyo^ or little
sauoure in him / for without some sorrow or pain no man may live in love / he
that is not always redye to sussre / and to stand fully at the will of his
beloved / is not worthy to be called a lover / for it behooves a lover to
suffer gladly all hard and bitter things for his beloved / and not to declyne
from his love for no contrarious thing that may befall unto him.

Of the proof of a true lover of god. The.vii. Chapter.
MI son says our savior Christ thou art not yet a strong and a wise lover:
for why? For a little aduersite thou leuest anon that thou haste begone in my
service and with great desire thou sekest outward co^solacyons But a strong
and a faithful lover of god stands stable in all aduersytes and gives
little hed^ to the deceytfull persuacyons of the enemy. And as I please him in
prosperyte: so I dysplease him not in aduersyte. A wise lover consydereth not
so much the gift of his lover as he does the love of the gyuer / he
regardethe more the love than the gift / and accompteth all gifts little in
comparyson of his beloved that gives the^ to him A noble lover restethe not in
the gift / but in me above all gifts / ferthermore it is not all lost
though thou sometime feel less deuocyo^ to me and to my saints than thou
woldeste do / and on that other side the sweet ghostely desire that thou felest
sometime to thy Lord Jesus / is the feable gift of grace given to thy conforte
in this life and a taste of the heavenly glory in the life to come / but it is
not good that thou leave ouermoche to such confortes for they lyghtely come and
go after the will of a gyuer / but to strive always without cessyng against all
evil mocyons of syne / and to despise all the suggestyons of the enemy is a
token of perfyte love and great merit and syneguler grace / let no vanitis ne
no strange fantysyes trouble the of what matter so ever they be* Keep thine
intent and thy purpose always hole and strong to me / and think not that it
is an illusion that thou art suddenly rauysshed in to excess of mind / and
that thou art sone after turned again in to thy first lyghtnes of heart /
for thou suffer such lyghtnes rather against thy will than with thy will.
And therefore if thou be dyspleased therewith / it shall be to the great merit
and no perdicion. I know says ou^ lord that the old auncyente enemy the
find will assaye to let thy good will / and to extincte the good desire that
thou haste to me / and to all goodness all that he can / and he will also hyndre
the from all good warkes and devout exercises if he may: that is to say from
the honor and worshype that thou art bounden to give to me and to my saints
/ and from mind of my passion / and from the remembrance of thine own sins
/ from a diligente keeping of thy heart in good meditacyons: and from a
steadfast purpose to profit in virtue / he will also put in to thy mind many
ydell thoughts to make ^he yrke and to be sone weary with prayer and with
redynge and with all other good virtuous warkes. A meke co^fessyon dyspleaseth
him much and if he can he will let a man that he shall not be howsyled. But
believe him not ne care not for him though he assail the never so much / make
all his malice return to him self again and say to him thus. Go from me
thou wicked spirit: and be thou ashamed / for thou art foul and vggely that
would bring such things in to my mind. Go fro me thou false deceyuer of
mankind: thou shall have no part in me / for my sauyoure Jesus stands by me
as a mighty warryour and a strong champyo^ / and thou shall fle away to thy
confusyon. I had lever suffer the most cruel death than to consent to thy
malycious styrrynges / be still therefore thou cursed find and cesse thy
malice: for I shall never assente to the / though thou vex me never so much.
Our lord is my light and my health whom shall I dread and he is the defender
of my life / what shall I fear. Truly though an host of men arise against
me: my heart shall not dread them: for why? God is my helper and my redemer.
Than says our lord again to such a soul.: Strive always as a true knight
against all the styrrynges of the enemy: and if thou be sometime through thy
fraylte overcome rise sone again and take more strength tha^ thou had
first and trust verily to have more grace and more comfort of god tha^ thou
haddeste before / but beware always of vain glory and pride / for thereby many
persons have fallen into great errors and into great blyndnes of soul so
far: that it has been right nyghe incurable. Be it therefore to the a great
example and a matter of perpetual mekenes: the fall and ruin of such proud
folks / that folyshely have presumed of them self. And have in the end
finally peryshed by their presumpcyon.

How grace is to be kept close through the virtue of mekenes. The.viii.
Chapter.
MI son: it is much more expedyente: and much more the suerer way for the
/ that thou hyde the grace of devotion / and not to speak much of it / ne
much to regard it / but rather to dyspise thy self the more for it: and to
think thy self unworthy any such gracyous gift of god / than to speak of
it. And it is not good to cleave much to such affections that may be sone
turned to the contrary. Wha^ thou have the grace of deuocio^ consider how
wretched and how nedy thou were wo^t to be wha^ thou hadest no such grace.
The profit and increase of life spyritual is not only wha^ thou have deuocio^
but rather when thou canste mekely and pacyently bear the withdrawynge / and
the absentinge thereof / and yet not to leave thy prayers ne thy other good deeds
that thou art accustomed to do: undone but to thy power and as far as in the
is / thou doste thy best therein and forgettest not thy duty therefore nor thou
art not negligente for any dulnes or unquietness of mind that thou feleste.
Nevertheless there be many persons that when any aduersyte falls to them they
be anon vnpacye^t and be made thereby very slow and dull to do any good deed /
and they hyndre them self greatly. For it is not in the power of man the way
that he shall take / but it is only in the grace of god to dyspose that after
his will and to send comfort wha^ he will and as much as he will and to
whom he will as it shall please him and none otherwise. Some unware persons
through an vndescrete desire that they have had to have the grace of devotion
have distroyed themself / for they would do more than their power was to do.
And would not know the mesure of their gift ne thy lytelnes of their own
strength: but rather would follow the pride of their heart tha^ the judgment
that it of reason. And because they presumed to do greater things than was
pleasant to god / therefore they lost anon the grace that they had before /
and were left nedy and without comfort / which thought to have builded their
nestes in heaven / and so they were taught not to presume of them self / but
mekely to trust in god and in his goodness. Also such persons as be
begynners: and yet lack experyence in ghostly travail: may lyghtely err and
be deceived / but they will be ruled by counsel of other. And if they will
nedely follow their own counsel and will in no wise be removed fro their
own will / it will be very perylous to them i^ the end And it is not lightly
seen that they that be wise and co^nynge in their own sight will be mekely
ruled or ordered by other It is better to have little conninge with mekenes
than great co^nyng with vain lykyng therein / and it is better to have little
connyng with grace / than much co^nynge whereof thou shuldeste be proud / also
he does not discretly that in time of devotion sets him self all to
spiritual mirth and as it were to a heavenly gladness: and forgets his former
desolacion and the meke dread of god. Ne he does not well nor virtuously that
in time of trouble or of any manner aduersyte or grauite bears him self
overmuch desperately and feleth not ne thinks not so trustfully of me as he
ought to do / he that in time of peace and of ghostly conforte will think him
self over much syker / commonly in time of battle and of temptacyon shall be
found ouermuhe deiecte and ferefull. But if thou could always abide meke
and little in thine own sight and could order well the mocyons of thine
own soul / thou should not so sone fall into presumpcyo^ or dyspayre / ne
so lightly offend almyghtye god / wherefore this is good and wholesome counsel
/ that when thou haste the spyryte of feruoure thou think how thou shall do
when that feruoure is passed / and than when it happens so with the: that
thou think that it may sone come again / which to my honor and to thy
proving I have withdrawn for a time. And it is more profitable to the that
thou shuldeste be so proved than that thou should always have prosperous
things after thy will / for why merytes are not to be thought great in any
person because he has many vysyons or many ghostly co^fortes / or for that he
has clear understanding of scripture or that he is set in high degree But if
he be stably grounded in mekenes and be fulfilled with charity / and seek holy
the worship of god and in nothing regards him self / but fully i^ his
heart can dispyse him self / and also coueyteth to be despised of other / than
may he have good trust that he has somewhat profyted in grace and that he shall
in the end have great reward of god for his good travail. Amen.

How we shall think through mekenes our self vile and abiecte in the sight
of God. The.ix. Chapyter.
SHall I lord Jesus dare speak to the: that am but duste and ashes: verily if
I think my self any better than ashes and duste / thou standeste against
me. And also mine own sins bear wytnes against me that I may not with say
it / but if I despise my self and set my self at naught / and think my
self but ashes and duste as I am / than thy grace shall be nyghe unto me: and
the light of true understanding shall enter into my heart / so that all
presumpcion and pride in me shall be drowned in the vale of mekenes through
parfyte knowing of my wretchedness. Through mekenes thou shall show unto me
what I am / what I have been and fro whens I came / for I am naught and knew it
not / if I be left to my self tha^ am I naught and all is feebleness and
inperfeccion. But if thou vouchesafe a little to behold me / anon I am made
strong / and filled with a new joy and marvel it is that I wretch / and so
sone lift up fro my unstableness in to the beholdynge of heavenly things / and
that I am so louyngly enhalsed of the: that of my self fall down always to
erthely lykynges. But thy love lord: causes all this which preuenth me: and
helps me in all my necessytyes / and keeps me warely from all perils and
dangers that I am daily like to fall into. I have lost the and also my self
by inordynate love that I have had to my self / and in keeping of the again. I
have found both the and me and therefore will I more depely from henseforth
set my self at naught and more delygently seek the tha^ I have done i^ time
paste / for thou lord Jesus thou doste to me above all my merytes / and above
all that I can ask or desire. But blessed be thou in all thy warkes for
though I be unworthy good things / yet thy goodness never cesseth to do well
to me and all so to many other / which be unkind to the and that are turned
right far fro the. Turn us Lord therefore to the again that we may
hensforwarde be loving / thankeful / meke / and devout to ye / for thou art
our health / thou art our virtue / and all our strength in body and in soul /
and none but thou / to the therefore be joy and glory euerlastyngly in the
bless of heaven Amen.

How all things are to be referred to god as end of every warke. The.x.
Chapyter.
MI sone says our savior Christ I must be the end of all thy war^es if
thou desire to be happy and blessed And if thou refer all goodness to me from
whom all goodness comes. Tha^ shall be pourged and made clean in the / thine
in ward affeccyons which else would be evil enclyned to thy self and to
other creatures / if thou seek thy self in any thing as end of thy warke /
anon thou faylest in thy doing and waxest dry and bareyn from all moyster of
grace / wherefore thou must refarre al things to me for I give all. Behold
therefore all things as they be flowynge and spryngynge out of my sovereign
goodness: and reduce al things to me as to their original begi^ninge / for of
me both small and great / poor and rich as of a quycke springyng well draw
water of life / he that serves me freely / and with good will / shall receive
grace for grace. But he that will glorifye him self in him self / or will
fully joy i^ any thing beside me / shall not be stablesshed in parfyte joy ne
be dilated in soul / but he shall be let and anguysshed many ways from the
true fredome of spirit / thou shalt therefore ascrybe no goodness to thy self
ne thou shalt not think that any person has any goodness of him self / but
that thou yield always the goodness to me / without whom man has nothing. I
have given all: and all will I have again and with great straynes / will I
look to have thankynges therefore. This is the truth whereby is driven away al
manner of vain glory and pride of heart if heavenly grace and perfyte charity
enter into thy heart / than there shall no envy ne unquietness of mind ne any
pryuate love have true ruele in the. For the charity of god shall overcome all
things / and shall dilate and inflame all the powers of thy soul. Wherefore if
thou understand a right thou shalt never joy but in me: and in me only
thou shalt have trust / for no man is good but god alone / which is above all
things to be honored and in all things to be blessed. Amen.

That it is sweet and delectable to serve god / and to forsake the world.
The.xi. Chapyter.
How shall I yet speak again to the my Lord Jesus / and not cease. And I
shall say in the ^ares of my Lord: my god and king / that is in heaven.: O
how great is the habundau^ce of ye swetnes which thou have hyde and kept for
them that dread the. But what is it than to the^ that love the: and that with
all their heart do serve the / verily it is the unspeakable swetnes of
co^templacyo^ that thou give to them that love the. In this Lord thou haste
most showed the swetnes of thy charity to me / that when I was not thou made
me / and when I erred far from the / thou broughteste me again to serve the /
and thou co^maundest me also that I shall love the. O fountain of love
everlasting what shall I say of the / how may I forgette the: that haste
vouchedsafe thus loungly to remember me. When I was like to have perished thou
shewedest thy mercy to me above all that I could have thought and desired /
and haste sent me of thy grace and of thy love above my merits. But what
shall I give to the again for all this goodness. It is not given to all men to
forsake the world and to take a solytary life and only to serve the. And yet
it is no great thing to serve the / whom every creature is bounden to serve.
It ought not therefore to seem any great thing to me to serve the / but rather
it should seem marvel and wonder to me / that thou will vouchesafe to
receive so poor / and so unworthy a creature as I am into thy service / and
that thou wylt join me to thy well-beloved servants. Lo lord al things that
I have: and all that I do the service with be thine. And yet thy goodness is
such that thou rather seruest me than I the. For lo? heaven and earth /
planettes / and sterres with their co^tentes which thou haste created to serve
man / be ready at thy byddyng and do daily that thou haste commanded. And thou
haste also ordained Angels to the mynistery of man. But above all this thou
haste vouchedsafe to serve man thy self / and haste promised to give thy self
unto him / what shall I tha^ give to the again for this thousa^de fold goodness
/ would to god that I might serve the all the days of my life / or at the least / that I might one day be able to do the faylthful service for thou art
worthy al honor service and praysinge for ever Thou art my lord and my god /
and I thy poorest servant most bounde^ before al other to love the and praise
the / and I never ought to wax weary of the praising of the. And that is it that
I ask: that I desire / that is to say / that I may always laud the and praise
the / voutchsafe therefore most merciful lord to supplye that wants in me /
for it is great honor to serve the and al erthly things to dispyse for the
love of the. They shall have great grace that freely submytteth them self to
thy holy service. And they shall find also the most sweet consolacyon of the
holy ghooste / and shall have great fredome of spirit / that here forsake al
worldly busynes and chose an hard and a strayte life in this world for thy
name.. O fre and joyful service of god / by the which a man is made fre and
holy / and also blessed in the sight of god.. O holy state of religyon which
makes a man like to Aungelles pleasant to god / dreadful to wicked spirits /
and to all faithful people right hyghly commendable. O service much to be
enhalsed and always to be desired / by whom the high goodness is won and the
everlasting joy and gladness is gotten without end.

:That the desires of the heart ought to be well examyned / and well to be
modered. The.xii. Chapyter.
MI sone says our lord it behooves the to learn many things / that thou
haste not yet well learned. What be they Lord that thou order thy desires and
thy affeccyons holy after my pleasure / and that thou be not a lover of thy
self / but a desirous follower of my will in all things / I know well that
desires often move the to this thing or to that. But consider well whether thou
be moved principally for my honor or for thyn own. If I be i^ the cause thou
shall be well co^te^ted what so ever I do with ^he but if any thing remain in
thy heart of thine own will / that is it that lets the and hyndereth the.
Beware therefore that thou leave not much to thine own desire without my
counsel / lest hapely it for think the and displease the i^ the end that
first pleased the. Every affection and desire of man's heart that seems good
and holy / is not forhwith to be followed nor every contrarious affeccion or
desire is not hastily to be refused it is sometime right expedyent that a man
refrain his affeccions and desires though they be good / lest happily by his
importunite he fall into unquietness of mind / or be let by other / and so
fail i^ his doing and sometime it behooves us to use as it were a vyolence to
our self and strongly to resyst and break down our sensual appetyt and not to
regard what the flesh will / or will not / but always to take heed that it be
made subject to the will of the spirit / and that it be so long chastysed
and compelled to serve till it be ready to al thing that the soul commands /
and that it can learn to be content with a little and can delyght in simple
things: and not to murmur ne to grudge for no co^trarious thinger that may
befall unto it.

:How we should keep pacyence and contynually strive against al concupiscence.
The.xiii Chapyter.
O My lord god as I here say pacyence is much necessary unto me / for many
contraryous things fall daily in this life. I se well that how so ever I
order my self to have peace yet my life can not be without some battle and
sorrow.: My sone it is true as thou say / wherefore I will not that thou seek
to have such peace as wants temptacions or as feleth not some contradiccyon.
But that thou trow and believe that thou haste found peace when thou haste
many troubles and art proved with many co^trarious things in this world and
if thou say thou may not suffer such things / how shall thou than suffer
the fire of purgatory. Of two euyl^es the less evil is to be taken. Suffer
therefore pacyently the little pains of this world / that thou may here
after escape the greater in the world to come. Trowest thou that worldly men
suffer litel or nothing? yes truly / thou shalt find none without some
trouble though thou seek the most delycate persons that be. But percase thou
say unto me again they have many delectacyons and follow their own
pleasures so much that they po^der but little all their aduersite. I will well
it be as thou say that they have all that they can desire / but how long
trowest thou that it shall endure. Sothely it shall suddenly vanysshe away as
smoke in the air / so that there shall not be left any remembrance of their
joys passed And yet when they lived they were not without great bytternes and
grefe / for oftentimes of the same thing wherein they had their greatest
pleasure received they after great trouble and pain: and ryghtewysely came
that unto them / that for asmoche as they sought delectacyons and pleasures
inordynately / that they should not fulfill their desire therein but with great
bytternes and sorrow.: How short / how false / and how inordynate be all
the pleasures of this world / sothly for dronkenshype and blyndnes of heart /
the worldely people perceive it not / ne will not perceive it: but as a dombre
beastes^ For a lyt^ll pleasure of this corruptyble life they re^ne hedlyng into
everlasting death.: Therefore my sone go not thou after thy concupycense / but
turn the lightly from thine own will: delight the in god and fix thy love
strongely in him and he shall give the / the askyng of thy heart. And if thou
wylt have consolacyon abundantly and will receive the sothfast comfort that
comes of god / dyspose thy self fully to despise this world and put from
the holy all inordynate delectacyon / and thou shalt have plentuously the
comfort of god. And the more that thou withdrawest the from the consolacyon of
all creatures / the more sweet and blessed consolacio^s shalt thou receive of
thy creatoure. But sothly thou canste not at the first come to such
consolacyons but with heaviness and labor going before thy old custom will
somewhat with stand the / but with a better custom if may be overcome. The
flesh will murmr against the / but with feruoure of spirit it shall be
refrayned. The old au^cyent enemy the fend will let the if he ca^ but with
devout prayer he shall be driven always / and with good bodily and ghostely
labors his way shall be stopped so that he shall not dare nyghe unto the.

:Of the obedyence of a meke subject after the example of our lord Jesus
Christ. The.xiiii. Chapyter
MI sone says our savior Christ he that labors to withdraw him from
obedyence withdrawethe him fro grace And he that seeks to have pryuate things
leseth the things that be in common / if a man can not gladly submytte him to
his superyoure / it is a token that his flesh is not yet fully obedyent to the
spirit / but that it often rebelleth and murmureth. Therefore if thou desire to
overcome thy self and to make thy flesh obey mekely to the will of the
spirit / learn first to obey gladly to thy superior. The out ward enemy is
the sooner overcome if the inner man that is the soul be not febled nor
wastede. There is no worse ne none more grievous enemy to the soul: than thy
self if thy flesh be not well agreyng to the will of the spirit. It behooves
the therefore to have a true dispising and contempt of thy self / if thou wylt
prevail against thy flesh and blood / but for asmoche as thou yet love thy
self inordynatly / therefore thou fear to resign thy will holy to an other
man's will. But what great thing is it to the that art but duste and naught
/ if thou subdue thy self to man for my sake / wha^ I that am all mighty and
most high god / maker of all things subdued my self mekelye to manne for
thy sake. I made my self most meke and most low of all men / that thou
should learn to overcome thy pride through my mekenes / learn therefore thou
ashes to be tractable / learn thou earth and duste to be meke and to bow thy
self under every man's so^e for my sake / learn to break thine own will /
and to be subject to all mean as in thy heart. Rise in great wrath against
thy self / and suffer not pride to reygne in the / but show thy self so
little and so obedyent and so noughty in thine own sight: that as the thynkes
all men may ryghtwysely go over the and trede upon the / as upon earth or clay.
O vain man what haste thou to complain. O thou soul sinner / what may
thou ryghtwysely say against the^ that reprove the sith thou haste so often
offended god / and haste also so often deserved the pains of hell. But
nevertheless my eye of mercy has spared the for thy soul is precious in my
sight / that thou shuldesse thereby know the great love that I have to the and
be therefore the more thankful to me again and give thy self to parfyte and
true subieccion and mekenes / and to ^e ready in heart pacie^tly to suffer for
my sake thine own co^temptes and dispisinges / wha^ so ever they shall happen
to fall unto the. Amen.

Of the secret and hyd iugementes of god to be considered: that we be not
proved of our good deeds. The.xv. Chapter.
Lord thou sowneste thy iugementes terryblye upon me / and fylleste my body
and bones with great fear and dread / my soul also trembles very sore / for
I am greatly astonyed for that I se that heuenes been not clean in thy sight /
for sithe thou foundeste defaut in angels and sparedest them not what shall
become of me yt am but vile and stynkyng careyne. Sterres fell from heaven: and
I duste and ashes what should I presume. Also some people that seemed to have
great works of virtue / have fallen full low. And such as were fed with
meat of angels / I have seen after delight in swynes meat / that is to say in
flesshly pleasures / wherefore it may be well said and verified that there is
no holiness ne goodness in us: if thou withdraw thy hand of mercy from us / ne
that no wisdom may avail us.: If thou lord govern it not: ne any strength
help / if thou ceise to preserve us / ne no sure chastyte can be if thou lord
defend it not / ne any sure keeping many profit us / if thou lord be not
wakery upon us for if we be forsaken of the anon we be drowned and perysshe /
but if thou a little vysyte us with thy grace: we anon live and be lift up
again. We be unstable: but by the we be confermed / we be cold and dull / but
by the we be styrred to feruoure of spirit. O how mekely and how abiectely
ought I therefore to feel of my self / and how much ought I in my heart
despise my self / though I be holde^ never so good and holy in sight of the
world / and how profoundely ought I to submytte me to thy deep and profounde
iugementes / sith I find in my self nothing else but naught and naught. O
substance that may not be pondered. O see that may not be sailed / in the /
and by the I find that my substance is nothing and over all naught. Where is
now the shadow of this worldely glory / and where is the trust that I had in
it. Truly it is vanyshed away through the depnes of thy secret and hid
iugementes upon me. What is flesh in thy sight / how may clay glorifye him
self against his maker / how may he be deceived with vain praises / whose
heart in troth is subject to god: all the world may not lift him self in
to the pride / whom troth that god is: has perfytely made subject unto him
/ ne he may not be deceived with any flateryng: that puts all his hole
trust in god. For he sees well that they that speak be vain and naught / and
that they shall shortly fail with the sound of words / but the troth of
god always abides.

How a man shall order him self in his desires. The.xvi. Chapter.
MI son (says our Savior Christ) Thus shalt thou say in every thing
that thou desyreste. Lord if it be thy will: be it done as I ask / and if it
be to thy praysinge / be it fulfilled in thy name. And if thou se it good and
profitable to me / give me grace to use it to thy honor.: But if thou know
it hurtefull to me: and not profitable to the health of my soul / than take
from me such desire. Every desire comes not of the holy ghost though it
seem right wise and good / for it is sometime full herd to judge whether a good
spirit or an evil spirit / moves to this thing or to that / or whether
thou be moved of thine own spirit: Many be deceived in the end / which
first seemed to have been moved of the holy ghooste. Therefore with dread of
god / and with mekenes of heart it is to desire and ask what so ever comes
to our mind / to be desired and asked / and with a hole forsakynge of our
self: to co^myte all things to god and say thus.: Lord thou know what
thing is to me most profitable: do this or that after thy will / give me
what thou will / as much as thou will / and when thou will / do with me as
thou knoweste best to be done / and as it shall please the / and as shall be
most to thy honor / put me where thou will / and freely do with me in all
things after thy will: thy creature I am and in thy hands led me and turn
me where thou will. Lo. I am thy servant ready to al things that thou
co^maundest: for I desire not to live to my self: but to the would to god it
might be worthily and profytably and to thy honor. Amen.

A prayer that the will of god he always fulfilled. The.xvii. Chapter.
Most benygne lord Jesus grant me thy grace / that it may be always with me
and warke with me and perseruer with me unto the end And that I may ever
desire and will that is most pleasau^te and most acceptable to the.: Thy will
be my will / and my will always to follow thy will / and best accord therewith.
Be there always in me one will: and one desire with the / and that I have no
power to will: or to not will: but as thou will: or will not. And grant me
that I may dye to all things that be in the world and for the / to love to be
despised and to be as a man unknown in this world. Grant me also above all
things that can be desired that I may rest me in the: and fully in the to
pacyfye my heart / for thou lord art the very true peace of heart and the
parfyte rest of body and of soul. And without the all things be grievous and
unquiet / wh^^fore in that peace tha^ is in the one high one blessed and one
endless goodness shall I always rest me / so mo^ it be. Amen.

:That the very true solace and conforte is in god. The.xviii. Chapter.
WHat so ever I may desire or think to my comfort / I abide it not here / but
I trust to have it herafter / for if I alone might have all the solace and
comfort of this world and might use the delytes thereof after mine own
desire without sin. It is certain that they might not long endure /
wherefore my soul may not fully be comforted ne perfytely be refresshed but in
god only that is the co^forter of the poor in spiryt and the embracer of the
meke and low in heart. Abide my soul: abide the promise of god / and thou
shalt have abundau^ce of al goodness in heaven. If thou inordinatly coueyte
these goods p^sent thou shalt lose the goodness eternal / have therefore goods
present in ^se and eternal in desire. Thou may in no manner be sacyate with
temporal goods / far thou art not create to use them and to restethe in them
/ for if thou alone myghtest have all the goods that ever were create and made
thou mighteste not therefore be happy: and blessed / but thy blessed fulness and
thy full felicite stands only in god that has made all things of naught /
and that is not such felicite as is commended of the folysshe lovers of the
world: but such as good christian men and women hope to have in the bleshe of
heaven / and as some ghostely persons clean and pure in heart sometime do taste
here in this present life / whose conuersacyon is in heaven. All worldly solace
and all man's conforte is vain and short: but that conforte is blessed and
sothfaste that is perceived by troth inwardely in the heart. A devout follower
of god bears always about with him his co^forter that is Jesus / and says
thus unto him. My lord Jesus I beseech the that thou be with me in every place
and every time and that it be to me a specyal solace gladely for thy love to
want all man's solace. And if thy solace want also / that thy will and thy
ryghtwyse proving and assayinge of me / may be to me a synguler conforte and a
high solace / thou shalt not always be angry with me: ne thou shalt not
always threte me: so mo^ it be. Amen.

That all our study and busynes of mind ought to be put in God. The.xix.
Chapitre.
MI son (has our lord to his seruaunt^) suffer me to do with the what I
will for I know what is best and most expedient to the thou workest i^ many
things after thy kyndly reason and after as thy affection and thy worldely
pollycy styreth the / and so thou may lightly err and be deceived. O lord
it is true all that thou say / thy providence is much more better for me /
than all that I can do say for my self. Wherefore it may well be said and
verified that he stands very casually that sets not all his trust in the /
therefore lord while my wit abides steadfast and stable: do with me in all
things as it pleases the / for it may not be but well all that thou doeste /
if thou will that I be in light be thou blessed / and if thou wylt I be in
darkness: be thou also blessed. If thou vouchesafe to comfort me / be thou
hyghly blessed. And if thou will I live in trouble and without all comfort:
be thou in like much blessed. My son so it behooves to be with the / if thou
wylt walk with me / as ready must thou be to suffer as to joy / and as gladly
be nedy and poor as welthy and rich Lord I will gladly suffer for the what
so ever thou will shall fall upon me / indyfferently will I take of thy hand
good and bad / bitter and sweet / gladness and sorrow / and for all things that
shall befall to me / hertely will I thank the. Keep me lord from sin and I
shall neither dread death ne hell / put not my name out of the book of life /
and it shall not grieve me what trouble so ever befall upon me.

That all temporal miseris are gladely to be borne through example of Christ.
The xx. Chapitre.
MI son (says our Lord) I descended from heaven / and for thy health have
taken thy myseryes not compelled thereto of necessyte / but of my charity / that
thou shuldeste learn to have pacyence with me / and not to dysdayne to bear
the myseryes / and the wretchedness of this life: as I have done for the for
from the first hour of my birth unto my death upon the cross / I was never
without some sorrow or pain / I had great lack of te^porall things / I hard
great co^playntes made on me / I suffered benyngnely many shames and rebukes /
for my benefaytes: I received unkindness / for my miracles / blasphemes / and
for my true doctrine many repre^es.: O lord for as much as thou werte found
pacyente in thy life / fulfyllynge in that most specially the will of thy
father / it is sitting that I most wretched sinner bear me pacyently after
thy will in all things / and as long as thou will that I for mine own
health bear the bourden of this corruptyble life.: For though this life be
tedyous / and as an heavy bourden to the soul / yet nevertheless / it is now
thoroughe thy grace made very merytoryous / and by example of the and of thy
holy Saints it is now made to weyke persons more sufferable and more clerer
and also much more confortable than it was in the old law: when the gates of
heaven were shut and the way thetherwarde was dark and so few did covet to
seek it And yet they that were tha^ right wise and were ordained to be saved /
before thy blessed passion and death: might never have come thither. O what
thanks am I bound therefore to yield to the / that so louyngly have
vouchesaufe to show to me / and to all faithful people that will follow the /
the very true and strayte way to thy kingdom. Thy holy life is our way and by
thy patience we walk to the that art our heed and governor. And but thou
lord had gone before and showed us the way / who would have endeavored him
to have followed. O how many should have tarried behind if they had not seen
thy blessed examples going before: we be yet slow and dull / now we have
seen and hard thy signs and doctrynes: what should we tha^ have been if we
had seen no such light going before us: truly we should have fired our mind
and our love holy in worldly things / from the which keep us lord of thy
great goodness. Ame^.

Of pacyente sufferyng / of iniuryes and wrongs / and who is truly pacyente.
The.xxi.
MI sone what is it that thou spekest why do thou thus compain / cesse
cesse compain no more / consider my passion / and the passions of my saints
and thou shall well se that it is right little that thou doeste suffer for me /
thou haste not yet suffered to the shedynge of thy blood / and truly thou
haste little suffered in co^paryson of the^ that have suffered so many things
for me in time paste / and that have been so strongly tempted / so grievously
troubled / and so many ways proved. It behooves the therefore to remember the
great grievous things that other have suffered for me / that thou may the more
lightly bear thy little grefes. And if they seem not little to the / look thy
inpacience cause not that but nevertheless whether they be little or great /
study always to bear them patiently with out gruogynge or co^playnynge if thou
may / and the better that thou canste dyspose the to suffer them the more
wyselyer thou doeste / and the more merit shalt thou have and thy bourden by
reason of thy good custom and of thy good will shall be the lyghter / thou
shalt never say I can suffer this thing of such a person / nor it is not
for me to suffer it / he has done me great wrong / and leyith unto my charge
that I never thought / but of an other man I will suffer as I shall think /
such manner saynges ben of good / for they consider not the virtue of pacye^ce
nor of whom it shall be crowned / but they rather consider the persons and the
offenses done unto them. Therefore he is not truly pacyente that will not
suffer but as much as he will and of whom he will / for a true pacyente man
forseth not of whom he suffers: whither of his prelate or of his fellow that
is egall unto him: or any other that is under him / nor whether he be a good
man and a holy / or an evil man and an unworthy / but when so ever any
aduersyte / or wrong fails unto him what so it be and of whom so ever it be
/ and how often so ever it be / he takes all thankefully as of the hand of God
/ accompteth it is a rich gift and a great benefayte of god for he knows
well that there is nothing that a man may suffer for god that may pass
without great merit. Be thou therefore ready to battle / if thou will have
victory / without battle thou may not come to the crown of pacyence / and
if thou will not suffer: thou refusest to be crowned / wherefore if thou will
nedely be crowned resyste strongly and suffer patiently / for without labor no
man may come to rest / nor without battle no man may come to vyctory.: O
lord Jesus: make it possible to me by grace: that is impossyble to me by
nature. Thou knoweste well that I may little suffer and that I am anon cast
down with a little aduersyte / wherefore I beseech the that trouble and
aduersyte may herafter for thy name be beloved and defired of me for truly to
suffer and to be vexed for the is very good and profitable to the health of my
soul.

Of the knowleginge of our own infirmyties / and of the myseryes of this life.
The.xxii. Chapter
I Shall knowledge against me al my vnryghtwysenes / and I shall confess to the
Lord all the unstableness of mine heart. Oftymes it is but a little thing that
casts me down and makes me dull and slow to al good warkes and sometime I
purpose to stand strongly but when a little temptacyon comes it is to me
great anguysshes and grefe / and sometime of a right little thing / a grievous
temptacyon ryseth: and when I think my self to be somewhat syker / and that as
it seems I have the higher hand: suddenly I feel my self nere hand overcome
by a light te^ptacyon. Behold therefore good lord / behold my wekenes and my
fraylnes best known to the before all other. Have mercy on me Lord and
deliver me fro the fylthy dregs of sin that my fete be never fyxed in the^.
But this is it that often grudgeth me sore and in manner confounds me before
the that I am so unstable: and so weyke and so frail to resyste my passions.:
And though they draw me not always to consent: yet nevertheless their cruel
assautes be very grievous unto me / so that it is in manner tedyous to me for to
live in such battle: but yet such battle is not all unprofitable to me /
for thereby I know the better mine own infirmytes / for I se well that such
wicked fantesye do rise in me much so^er than they go away. But would ^o god
that thou most strongest god of Israel the lover of all faithful souls
woldeste vouchesafe to behold the labor and the sorrow of me thy poteste
servant / and that thou would assyste me in all things that I have to do
Strength me lord with heavenly strength so that the old enemy the ^ende / ne
my wretched flesh which is not yet fully subject to the spirit / have not
power ne lordeshype over me / against whom I must syghe continually / while
I shall live i^ this miserable life. But alas what life is this: where no
trouble nor mysery wants / where also every place is full of snares: and of
mortal enemies / for one trouble or temptacyon going away: a another comes
/ and the first conslycte ye^ during: many other suddenly rise / mo than can
be bought / how may this lyf^ therefore be loved that has such bytternes and
that is subject to so many myseries / and how may it be called a life that
brings forth so many dethes and so many ghostly infeccyons / and yet it is
beloved and much delyted in of many persons The world is often reproved that
it is deceytfull and vain and yet it is not lightly forsaken (especially) when
the concupisce^ces of the flesh be suffered to have reuele somthynges styre a
man to love the world and some to despise it / the concupyssence of the flesh
/ the co^cupyscence of the eye / and the pride of the heart: stir man to love
the world. But the pains and the myseres that follow of it / causes hatred
and tediousnes of it again. But alas for sorrow a little delectacyon
ouercometh the mind of them that be much set to love the world / and
dryueth out of their hertes all heavenly desires / in somuche that many account
it as a joy of paradyse to live under such sensyble pleasures / and that is
because they neither have seen ne tasted the swetnes in God / in the inward
gladness that comes of virtues.: But they that perfytely despise the world
and that study to live under holy dyscyplynes be not ignorant of the heavenly
swetnes that is promised unto ghostely lyuers / and they se also how grievously
the world erreth / and how grievously it is deceived in diverse manners.

:How a man should rest in god above all thing. The.xxiii. Chapter.
Above all things and in all things rest thou my soul in thy lord God /
for he is eternal rest of all Angels and saints. Give me Lord Jesus this
special grace for to rest me in the / above al creatures / above all health
and fayrenes / above all glory and honor above al dygnite and power / above
all conning and pollycy / above all riches and crafts / above all gladness of
body and soul / above all fame and praysynge / above all swetnes and
consolacion above all hope and repromyssyon / above all merytes and desire /
above all gifts and rewards that thou may give or send beside thy self.:
And above all joy and myrthe that man's heart / or mind may take or feel.
And also above all Angels and Archaungelles / and above all the company of
heavenly spyrytes / above all things vysyble and inuysyble / and above all
things that is not thy self. For thou Lord god ar^e most best / most
hygheste / most myghtyeste / most sufficye^t / and most full of goodness most
sweet / most comfortable / most fair most loving / most noble / most
glorious above all thing / in whom all goodness is to gether perfytly and
fully / has been and shall be. And therefore what so ever thou gyuest me beside
me self it is little and insufficient to me for my heart may not rest ne
fully be pacifyed but in the so that is ascend above all gifts and also above
all manner of things that be created. O my lord Jesus Christ most loving
spouse / most purest lover and governor of every creature / who shall give me
wrong of perfect lyberty that I may fle high and rest me in the. O when shall
I fully tente to the / and se and feel how sweet thou art / when shall I
holy gather my self to gether in the so perfytely that I shall not for thy
love feel me self / but the only above my self / and about all bodily
things and that thou vysyte me in such wise as thou doste visyte thy
faithful lovers. Now I often mourn and complain the myseryes of this life
and with sorrow and woe bear them with right great heaviness / for many evil
things happen daily in this life / which often times trouble me and make me
very heavy and greatly darken mine understanding. They hyndre me greatly and put
my mind from the and so enco^bre me many ways that I can not have fre mind
and clean desire to the / ne have thy sweet enbrasynges that to thy blessed
saints be always present. Wherefore I beseech the Lord Christ Jesus that the
syghinges and the inward desires of my heart with my manyfolde desolacions may
somewhat move the and inclyne the to here me^ O Jesus the light and bryghtnes of
everlasting glory / the joy and conforte of all christen people that are
walking and labourynge as pylgrimes in wyldernes of this world my heart cries
to the by still desires without voice and my scyle^ce speaks unto the and
says thus. How long taryeth my Lord God to come to me / verily I trust
that he will shortly come to me his poorest servant and conforte me and make
me ioyouse and glad in him. And that he will deliver me from all anguyshe and
sorrow. Come lord come / for without the I have no glade day / ne hour / for
thou art al my joy and gladness and without the my soul is barayne and void
I am a wretch and in manner in prison / and bound with fetters till thou
through the light of my gracious presence vouchesaufe to vysyte me and to
refresshe me / and to bring me again to liberty of spirit and that thou
vouchesaufe to show thy favorable and lovely countenance unto me. Let other
seek what they will / but truly there is nothing that I will seek nor that
shall please me / but thou my lord god my hope and everlasting health. I shall
not cesse of prayer: till thy grace return me again and that thou speak
inwardely to my soul / and say thus. Lo I am here / I am come to the for thou
haste called me / thy tears and the desires of thy heart: thy mekenes and thy
contricyo^ / have bowed me down and brought me to the. And I shall say again
/ lord I have called the / and I have desired to have the / ready to forsake
all things for the / thou first haste styred me to seek the wherefore be thou
always blessed that have showed such goodness to me after the multitude of the
mercy / what has thy servant lord more to do or say / but that he meken him
self before thy majesty / and ever have in mind his own iniquyte. There is
none like to the Lord in heaven ne in earth: thy warkes be good thy iugementes
be ryghtwyse and by thy prouydence all things be governed / wherefore to the
that art the wisdom of the father be everlasting joy and glory / and I
humbly beseech the that my body and soul / my heart and ^onge / and all thy
creatures may always laud the and bless the. Amen.

Of remembrynge of the great and manyfolde benefaytes of God. The.xxiiii.
Chapitre.
Open mine heart lord in to the beholdynge of thy laws and in thy
commandments teach me to walk / give me grace to know and to understand
thy will and with great reverence and dilygent consyderacion to remember the
manyfolde benefaytes that I may fro hensforth yield to the due tha^ kings for
them again. But I know and confess it for truth that I am not able to
yield to the condygne thankynges for the least benefyte that thou haste given
me / for I am less than the least be ne fayte that thou haste given. And wha^
I behold thy noblenes and thy worthynes my spirit dredeth and tre^bleth very
sore for the greatness thereof. O lord all that we have in body and in soul
within forth and without forth naturally or supernatural / they be they
benefa^tes and show the openly to be a blessed and a good benefactoure of
whom we have received such gifts and though one has received more / and an
other less: yet they all be thy gifts and without the / the least can not be
had / and he that has more received may not ryghtfully glorifye him self
therein as though he had gotten it by his own merit / ne exalte him self above
other / nor dysdayne other / nor despise his inferiors therefore / for he is
greatest and most acceptable to the / that lest ascrybeth to him self and
that is for such gifts the more weke and the more devout in yeldynge
thankynges to the for them again. And he that through mekenes can hold him
self most vile and most unworthy of al other: is the more apt to receive of
thy hand more larger gifts. And he that has received the fewer gifts ought
not therefore to be heavy ne to disdain at it / ne to be enuyous against them
that have received the greater / but rather he ought to lift his mind upward
to the and hyghely to laud and praise thy name that thou so lyberally / so
louyngly / and so freely without accepting of persons: departeste thy gifts
among thy people / all things come of the and therefore thou art in all
things to be blessed Thou know what is expedient to be given to every
person and why one has less and an other more / it is not to us to reason
to dyscusse: but unto the only by whom the merytes of every man shall be
dyscussed. wherefore Lord I account it for a great benefayte not to have many
gifts whereby outwardly and after man's judgment laud and praysyng should
follow. And over that as me seems all though a man consider and behold his
own pouertye and the vylenes of his own person he ought not therefore take
grefe or heaviness or deieccyon / but rather to co^ceyue thereby great gladness of
soul / for thou haste chosen and daily doste chose pore meke persons and such
as be dispysed in the world / to be thy ^^mylyer and house under hold
servants / wytnes thy Appostles whom thou madeste Princes of all the world
which nevertheless were conuersaunte among the people without complaining or
myssayge so meke and simple without all malice and dysceyte that ^hey ioyed to
suffer reprofes for thy name so farforth that such things as ye world
abhors and flees they coueyted with great desire / that it appears that
there ought nothing so much to conforte / and glad thy lover and him that
has received thy benefaytes as that thy will and pleasure in him be fulfilled
after thy eternal dysposicyon of him from the beginning / wherewith he ought
to be so well contented and pleased that he would as gladely beholden lest: as
other would be holden most / and as pacefull would he be and as well pleased
in the loweste place as in the highest / and as glad to be dispysed and abiec^e
and of no name ne reputacio^ in the world as other to be nobler: or greater /
for thy will lord and the honor of thy name ought to excel all things /
and more ought it to please and conforte thy lover than all other benefaytes
given or that might be given unto him.

Of four things that bring peace in to thy soul. The.xxv. Chapter.
MI son: now shall I teach the the very true way of peace / and of perfyte
lybertye.: O Lord Jesus do as thou sayste / for that is right joyous for me to
here / study my son rather to fulfill an other man's will tha^ thyn own
chose always to have little worldly riches rather tha^ much / seek also the
loweste place and desire to be under other rather than above / and coueyt
always and pray that the will of god be holy done in the. Lo such a person
enreth sothfastly in to the very true way of peace and in ward quyetnes. O
lord this short lesson that thou haste taught me co^teyneth in it self much
high perfeccion. It is short in words but it is full of sentence and
fruitful in virtue / for if it were well and faithfully kept of me /
vnrestfulnes should not so lightly spring in me as it has done / for as often
as I feel my self unrestful and not contented / I find that I have gone from
this lesson and / from this good and sweet doctrine.: But thou Lord Jesus that
all things haste under thy governance / and always loueste the heleth of
man's soul increase more grace in me that I may from hensforth fully these
teachynges and that I may do always that shall be to thy honor and to the
health of my soul. Amen.

:A prayer against all evil thoughts. The.xxvi. Chapter.
MI lord Jesus: I beseech the be not far from me but come shortly and help me
/ for vain thoughts have risen in mine heart and worldly dredes have troubled
me very sore / how shall I break them down / how shall I pass unhurt
without thy help / I shall go before the says our lord: and I shall drive
away the pride of thy heart / than shall I set open to the / the yates of
ghostly know lege and shall show to the the priuites of my secrets. O lord
do as thou say and than shall fle from me all wicked fantasyes / and truly
this is my hope and my only conforte / to fle to the in every trouble
steadfastly to trust in the / inwardly to call the / and patiently to abide thy
coming and thy heavenly consolacyons: which I trust shall shortly come to me.
Amen.

:A prayer for the clearynge of man's mind. The.xxvii. Chapter.
CLaryfye me Lord Jesus with the clerenes of the euerastynge light / and drive
out of my heart all manner of darkness / and all vain imagynacyons and
vyolente temptacyons / fight strongly for me / and drive away the evil
beasts / that is to say all my evil and wicked co^cupiscences that peace of
conscience may enter and have full reuele in me and that habundaunce of laud
and praising of thy name / may sound contynually in the chamber of my soul:
That is to say. In a pure and a clean conscience in me. Command the winds
and tempests of pride to cesse / bid the sea of worldly couetyse to be in
rest / and charge the northern wind / that is to say: the fendes temptacion
that it blow not / and tha^ shall be great tranquylyte and peace in me. Send
out thy light and thy troth of ghostly knowledge: that it may shine upon the
earth barayne and dry and send down thy grace from about and therewith
anoynte my dry heart. And give me the water of i^y devotion to moist therewith
the drynes of my soul that it may bring for the some good fruit that shall be
liking and pleasant to the. Reyse up my mind that is sore oppressed with the
heuye bourden of sin / and lift up my desire to the love of heavenly things
/ that by a taste of the heavenly felycyte it may loath to think on any erthely
things. Take me lord and deliver me from the vile consolacyon of creatures /
which must of necessytye shortly peryshe and fail. For there is nothing
create that may fully satisfy mine appetyte. Join me therefore to the with a
sure bond of heavenly love for thou only suffyseth to thy lover. And without
the all things be vain and of no substance.

:That it is not good to search curyously an other man's life The.xxviii.
Chapter.
MI son says our Lord: look thou be not curyous in serchyng of an other
man's life / ne that thou busy not thy self with things that belong not to
the / what is this or that to the / follow thou me / what is this to the
whether this man be good or bad. or whether he say or do this or that. Thou
nedest not to answer for an other man's deeds / but for thine own deeds thou
must nedely answer. Why do thou tha^ me^ie where needs not. I se and know
every man / and every thing under the sone I se and behold / and how it is
with every person / what he thinks: wha^ he wylleth and to what end his
work draws is open to me.: And therefore all things are to be referred to
me. Keep thy self always in good peace and suffer him that will algates search
an other man's life be as busye as he will. And in the end shall fall upon him
as he has done and said / for he can not disceiue me what so ever be he if
thou admonysshe any person for his soul health. Look thou do it not to get the
thereby any name / or fame in the world / ne to have the famylyaryte or pryuate
love of any person / for such things cause much unquietness of mind / and
will make and ca^se the also to lose the reward that thou shuldeste have of
god / and will bring great derkenes in to thy soul. I would gladly speak to
the my words and open to the the secret mysteres of fraternall correccyon: if
thou would prepayre thy soul ready against him coming / and that thou
woldeste open the mouth of thy heart faithfully to me. Be thou prouydent walk
dilyge^tly in prayer / meken thy self in every thing / and thou shall find
great comfort in god and little resystence in thine even christen.

In what thing peace of heart and greateste profit of man stands. The.xxix.
Chapter.
MI sone says our lord Jesus / I said to my dyscyples thus. My peace I leave
with you / my pear I give you / not as the world gives / but much more than
it may give. All me^ desire peace / but all me^ will not do that belongs to
peace / my peace is with the meke and mylde in heart And thy peace shall be in
more patience if thou will here me and follow my words thou shalt have great
ple^tie of peace. O lord what shall I do to come to that peace Thou shall in all
thy warkes take good head what thou doeste and say / and thou shalt set all
thy hole intent to please me / and nothing shall thou coueyt or seek without me
/ and of other me^nes deeds thou shall not judge presumptuously / ne thou shall
not meddle with things that pertayne not to the. If thou do thus it may be that
thou shall little or seldom be troubled / but nevertheless to feel no time / no
manner of trouble nor to suffer in heaviness in body ne in soul / is not the
state of this life but of the life to come.: Think not therefore that thou
haste foundeth true peace / for thou fealeste no grefe / ne that all is well
with the when thou haste none adversary / ne that all is perfyte / for that
every thing comes after thy mind. Ne yet that thou art great in gods sight
or specially beloved of him for thou have great fervor in devotion and great
swetnes in contemplacyon / for a true lover of virtue is not known by all
these things / nor the true perfeccyon of man stands not in them (wherein
than lord) In offering of a man with all his heart dooly to god not sekyng
him self ne his own will: neither in great thing nor in small in time nor in
eternite / but that he abide always one / and yield always like thanks to god
for things plesaunt and dyspleasaunte: weynge them all in one like balaunce as
in his love / and if he be also so strong in god that when inward consolacyon
is withdrawn / he can yet styre his heart to suffer more if God so will / and
yet he iustyfieth not him self ne praises not him self therefore / as holy
and right wise / than he walks in the very true way of peace and than he may
well have a sure and a perfyte hope and trust that he shall se me face to face
in everlasting joy and fruicyon in the kingdom of heaven. And if he can come
to a perfyte and a full contempt and dispysynge of him self: than shall be
have full habundau^ce of rest and peace in the joy everlasting after the
measure of his gift. Amen.

Of the lybertye / excellencye / and worthynes of a fre mind The.xxx. Chapitre.
Lord it is the warke of a perfyte man / never to sequestre his mind from the
beholdynge of heavenly things and among many cures: to go as he were without
cure / not in the manner of an idle: or of a dessolate person / but by the
special prerogatyue always of a free mind busye in gods service / not
cleuynge by inordynate affection to any creature.: I beseech the therefore my
Lord Jesus most meke / and merciful that thou keep me from the busynes and
cures of the world: and that I be not ouermuche inquyted with the necessytes
of the bodily kind / ne that I be not taken with the voluptuous pleasures of
the world ne of the flesh / and that in like wise thou preserve me from all
hynderaunce of the soul / that I be not broken with ouermuche heaviness /
sorrow / nor worldly dread. And by these petycions I ask not only to be
delivered from such vanytes as the world desires. But also from such
myseryes as grieve the soul of me thy servant / with the common maled^ccyon
of mankind: that is with corrupcyon of the bodyly feeling wherewith I an so
grieved and let that I may not have lybertye of spyryte to be hold the wha^
I would O lord god yt art swetnes unspeakable turn i^ to bitterness to me all
flesshly delytes / which would draw me from the love of eternal things to
the love of a short and a vile de^ectable pleasure / let not the flesh and
blood overcome me / ne yet the world with his short glory disceyue me / nor
the find with his thousand fold crafts suppla^te me / but give me ghostly
strength in resistyng / pacyence in sufferynge / and constaunce in
perseueryng. Give me also for all worldly consolacyons the most sweet
consolacion of the holy ghost. And for all flesshely love send in to my soul
the love of thy holy name. Lo meat / drink clothing / and all other
necessaryes for the body be paynfull and troublous to a fervent spirit which
if it might would always rest in god and in ghostly things Grant me therefore
grace to use such bodily necessaries temporately / and that I be not deceived
with ouermuche desire to them. To forsake all things it is not lawful for the
bodily kind must be preserved / and to seek superfluous things more for
pleasure than for necessyte / thy holy law prohibitethe: for so the flesh
would rebel against the spirit / wherefore lord I beseech the that thy hand
o / grace may so govern me and ^eache me that I excede not by any manner of
superfluyte. Amen.

:That pryuate love most lets a man from god. The xxxi. Chapitre.
MI son (says our Lord) it behooves the: to give all for all / and nothing
to keep unto the of thine own lout.: For the love of thy self more hurts
the / than any other thing in this world / after thy love / and after thine
affection / every thing eleuethe to the more or less. If thy love be pure /
simple and well ordered thou shall be without inordinate affeccion to any
creature. Coueyte therefore nothing that is not leful for the to have / and
have nothing that may let the from ghostly travail or that may take from the
inward liberty of soul It is marvel that thou comytteste not thy self
fully to me with all thy heart: with all things that thou may have or
desire / why art thou thus consumed with vain sorrow / why art thou wered
with superfluous cures: stand at my will and thou shall find nothing that
shall hurt the or hinder the / but if thou seek this thing or that / or
would be in this place or in that for thine own profit and for thine own
pleasure / thou shall never be in rest / ne thou shalt never be fre fro some
trouble of mind / for in every place shall be found some thing that will
myslyke the. Tra^sitory things when they be had and greatly multiplied in the
world do not always help man's soul to peace but rather when they be
dispysed and fully cut out of the love and desire of the heart and that is not
to be understand only of gold and silver and other worldly riches / but also
of desire of honors and praysinges of the world: which shortly vanyssheth
and passes away as does the smoke with the wind / the place helps little
if the spirit of feruoure be away. Also the peace that a man gets outward
shall not long stand hole if it be void fro the true inward peace of heart
/ that is to say though thou change thy place yet it shall little amend the /
but thou stand stable and steadfast in me: for by new occasions that shall
daily rise thou shall find that thou haste fled and percase much more
perilous and much more grievous things tha^ ye first were)

:A prayer to the purging of man's soul / and for heavenly wisdom and the
grace of god to be opteyned and had. The.xxxiii. Chapitre.
COnferme me Lord by the grace of the holy ghost / and give me grace be
strong inwardely in soul: and avoid out thereof all unprofitable bubusynes
of the world: and of the flesh that it be not led by the unstable desy^es of
earthly things. And that I may behold all things in the world as they be /
transitory and of short abydyng / and me also to go with them / for nothing
under the son may long abide / but al is vanite and afflictyo^ of spirit. O
how wise is he that feleth and understands this to be true that I have said
give me Lord therefore heavenly wisdom that I may learn to seek the and to
find the. And above al things to love the and al other things to understand
and know as they be after the order of thy wisdom and none otherwise. And
give me grace also wisely to withdraw me from them that flater me and
pacyently to suffer them that grieve me. For it is great wisdom not to be moved
with every blaste of words nor to give ear to him that flatereth as does the
Mearmayde. The way that is thus be gone / shall bring him that walks in it to
a good and a blessed ending.

Against the evil sayenges of detractours. The.xxxiii. Chapter
MI sone says our savior Christ Thou shalt not take it to grefe: though some
persons think evil or say evil of the yt thou would not gladly here / for
thou shalt yet think worse of thy self / and that no man is so evil as thou
art. If thou be well ordered with inforth in thy soul thou shall not much
care for such fleing words. And it is no little wisdom a man to keep him
self in scylence and in good peace when evil words be spoken to him / and to
turn his heart to god / and not to be troubled with man's judgment / let not
thy peace be in the hertes of men / for what so ever they say of the good or
bad thou art not therefore an other man / for as thou art: thou art. Where is
the true peace / and the true glory / it is not in me? Yes truly Therefore he
that neither desyrethe to please man: ne dredethe not to dysplease him shall
have great plentye of peace. For of inordynate love and vain dread comes
all unquietness of heart and vnrestfulnes of the mind.

How almighty god is to be in wardly called unto / in time of trybulacyon.
The.xxxiiii. Chapter.
Lord thy name be blessed for ever / that thou woldeste this temptacyon: and
trybulacyon should fall upon me.: I may not escapeit: but of necessyte I am
driven to fle to the / that thou vouchesafe to help me / and to turn all in
to my ghostely profit.: O lord I am now in trouble / and it is not well wfth
me for I am greatly vexed with this present passion / and now most best
beloved father what shall I say: I am now taken with anguysshes and troubles
on every side / save me in this hour / but I trust that I am come in to this
hour that thou shall be lauded and praised when I am perfytely made meke
before the: and that I am clearly delivered by the / be it therefore pleasant
to ye to deliver me / for what may I most sinful wretch do or whether may I
go without the. Give me pacyence now at this time in all my troubles: help me
my lord god / and I shall not feer ne dread what troubles so ever fall upon me.
And now what shall I say: but that thy will be done in me. I have deserved to
be troubled and grieved / and therefore it behooves that I suffer as long as it
shall please the but would to god yt I might suffer gladly till the furyous
te^pestes were over passed / and that quietness of heart might come again. Thy
mighty hand lord is strong enough to take this trouble fro me and to assuage
the cruel assautes thereof that I do not utterly fail as thou have often times
done to me before this time / and the more herd that it to me the more light
it is to the. And wha^ I am clearly delivered by the / than shall I say. This
is the chau^gyng of the right hand of him that is highest: that is the blessed
Trinite / to whom be joy / honor and glory euerlastyngly. Amen)

:Of the help of god to be asked / and of a full trust to recover through
devout prayer our former grace. The.xxxv. Chapitre.
MI sone I am thy lord that sends comfort in time of tribulacyo^ / come
therefore to me when it is not well with the. This is it that lets the most:
that thou tourneste the over slowly to me / for before thou pray hertely to me
thou sekest many other confortes and refresshest thy spirits in outward
things. And therefore it is / that all that thou doste: little avails the
till thou can behold and se that I am he that sends conforte to all that
faithfully do call to me / and that there is not without me any profitable
counsel ne perfyte remedy. But now take a good spirit to be and after thy
troubles be thou conforted in me / and in the light of my mercy: have thou
full trust / for I am nere to the to help the and to restore the again not
only to like grace as thou haddeste first / but also to much more i^ great
abundau^ce. Is there any thing herd or inpossible to em / or am I like to him
that says a thing and does it not / where is thy faith. Stand strongly and
perseuerently in me / be steadfast abidinge my promys and thou shall have
conforte in such time as it shall be most expedient to the. Abide abide and
tarry for me and I shall come soon / and help the^. It is temptacyon that
vexes the and a vain dread that fereth the much But what avails such fere
or dread for things that perchance shall never come but that the ghostly
enemy would thou shuldeste have sorrow upon sorrow. Bear therefore pacyently
thy troubles that be present / and dread not ouermuche those that be to come /
for it suffysethe to every day his own malice. It is a vain thing and an
unprofitable to be heuye or glad for things that perchance shall never happen
ne come. But it is the unstableness of man that he will be deceived and so
lyghtely to follow the suggestyon of the enemy for he carethe not whether he
may deceive be true suggestyon or by false / ne whether it be by love of
things present: or by dread of thing a to come. Therefore be thou not
troubled: ne dread thou not / trust strongly in me and in my mercy have
perfyte hope / for when thou wenest that thou art right far fro me often
times I am right nere unto the / and when thou weneste that all is lost /
than often times follows the greater reward. It is not thehfore al lost
thought some thing happen against thy will and thou shalt not judge therein
after thy outward feeling / ne thou shall not take any grefe so sore to heart
/ but that thou shalt have good trust to escape it. ne thou shalt not think
thy self all holy forsaken of me: though I send the for a time some heaviness
and trouble / for that is the seker way to the kingdom of heaven and doutles it
is more expedyent to the and to other my servants that ye sometime be proved
with aduersites / tha^ that ye have always all things after your wylles / I
know the hid thought of man and that it is much expedient to the health of the
soul that he be left sometime to him self without ghostly sauoure or
conforte: lest happily he be raised up into pride and think him self better
than he is. That I have given I may take away and may restore it again when I
shall list / when I give a thing to any person it is mine own that I have
given and when I take it away again / I take none of his for every good gift
and every perfyte reward comes of me. If I send to the trouble or heaviness
in what wise so ever it be / take it gladly and dysdayne it not ne let not thy
heart fail the therein / for I may anon lift the up again and turn thy
heaviness in to great joy and ghostely gladness / and verily I am ryghtwyse /
and much to be lauded and praised when I do so with the / if thou understand
a right: and behold thy self truly as thou art / thou shalt never be so
dyrectly heavy for no aduersyte / but rather thou shalt joy therein and think
it as the gretest gift that I spare not to scourge the with such trouble and
aduersyte / for I said to my discyples thus As my fader loves me I love you.
And yet I sent them not forth in to the world to have temporal joys: but to
have great batayles / not to have honors / but dispytes / not to be idle but
to labor not to rest / but to bring forth much good fruit in pacyence / and
in good works. My sone remember well these words yt I have spoken to ye for
they be true and can not be denied)

How we should forget all creatures that we might find our creature.
The.xxxvi. Chapitre.
Lord I have great need of thy grace / and that of thy great synguler grace
/ or that I may come thither where no creature shall set me / ne hinder me fro
the peryfte beholdynge of the for as long as any transitory thing holds me:
or has rule in me / I may not fle freely to the / he ^oucy^e^ to (...) with
out let that said thus.: Who shall give me wings like to a Dove: that I may
fle in to the bosom of my savior ^ and in to the holes of his blessed wounds
/ and rest me there. I se well that no man is more restfull: nor more liking
in this world that is that man which always has his mind and his hole
intent upward to god / and nothing desires of the world. It behooves him
therefore that would perfytely forsake him self / and behold the / to
surmounte all creatures and him self also / and through excess of mind to
se and behold that thou maker of al things have nothing among all creatures
like unto the / and but a man be clearly delivered fro the love of creatures he
may not fully tend to his creatoure / and that is the greatest cause why there
be so few contemplatyues / that is to say / because there be so few that
wylfully will sequestre them self fro love of creatures. To contemplacyon is
great grace required / for it lyfteth up the soul and rauysshethe it up in
spirit above it self. And but a man be lift up in spirit above him self
and be clearly delivered from all creatures as in his love: and be perfytely
and fully oned to god / what so ever he can or what so ever he hauee it her in
virtue or conning it is but litell worth before god. Therefore he shall have but
little virtue: and longr shall he lie still in earthely things that
accomptethe any thing great or worthy to be prayesd but only god for all
other things besides god are naught and for naught are to be accounted. It is
great difference between the wys^ome of a devout man lyghtned by grace / and
the conning of a subtle and studyous clerk / and that learning is much more
noble and much more worthy that comes by the influence and gracyous gift of
god: tha^ that that is gotten by the labor and study of man. Many desire to
have the gift of contemplacyon / but they will not use such things as be
required to co^templacion / and one great let of contemplacion is / that we
stand so long in outward signs and insensyble things and take no head of
perfyte mortifyeng of our body to the spirit. I wot not how it is / ne with
what spirit we be led / ne what we pretend / we that called spiritual
persons that we take greter labor and study for transytory things / that we
do to know the inward state of our own soul but alas for sorrow anon as we
have made a little recolleccyon to god we run forth to outward things and
do not search out own conscience with due examynacyon / as we should do ne we
head not where our affeccion rests / ne we follow not that our deeds so evil
/ and so unclean as they be. The people corrupted themself with flesshely
uncleanness and therefore followed the great flode / and verily wha^ our inward
affeccion is corrupted / it is necessary that our deeds folouinge thereupon be
also corrupted. For a clean heart springs the fruit of good life. It is often
times asked what deeds such a man has done / but of what zele or of what
intent he did the^ is little regarded / whether a man rich strong / fair /
able / a good writer / a good synger / or a good labourer is often inquired but
how poor he is in spirit / how pacyent and meke / how devout / and how
inwardly turned to god / is little regarded. Nature beholds the outward
deed but grace turned her to the inward intent of the deed. The first often
deceived / but the second puts her trust holy in god and is not deceived.

How we should forsake our self and thirst down all couetyse out of our
heart. The.xxxvii. Chapitre
MI son says our Lord / thou shalt not have perfyte lybertye of mind /
but holy forsake thy self / all propryetayres / and all lovers of them self
/ all coueytous persons / curyous / vain glorious / and all renners about.
And also such as seek things soft and delectable in this world / and not of
Jesus Christ / often faynynge and gredely sykynge things that shall not long
endure / be as men fetered and bounden with cheynes and have no perfyte lyberty
ne fredome of spirit / for all things shall perysshe that be not wroughte of
God / hold well in thy mind this short word / forsake all things and thou
shalt find all things / for sake couetyse and thou shalt find great rest
/ prynte well i^ thy mind that I have said / for wha^ thou haste fulfilled it
thou shalt well know that it is true. Lord this lesson is not one days
work / ne a play for children / for it is contained the full perfeccion of a
religion. Also my sone thou oughteste not to be turned fro god ne to be any
thing dyscouraged from his service wha^ thou hereste the strayte life of
perfyte men / but rather thou ought to be provoked thereby to higher
perfeccion and at least to desire i^ heart that thou myghtest come thereto. But
would to god thou were first come to this point that thou were not a lover of
thy self but that thou woldeste keep my commandments and the commandments
of him that I have appointed to be thy father spiritual / for than thou
shuldeste please me greatly and than all thy life shuldeste pass forth in joy
and peace. Thou haste yet many things to forsake / which but thou can holy
forsake (thou shall not get that thou desyreste. And therefore I counsel the
to bye of me bright shyninge gold / that is to say heavenly wisdom that
dispyseth all earthly things / and cast fro the all worldy wisdom and all
man's conforte and all thine own affeccyons / and that thou chose to have
vile things and abiecte / rather than precious and high in sight of the word
/ but the true heavenly wisdom seems to many to be vile and little and well
nyghe forgotten. Many can say with their mouth that it is good / not to
desire to be magnified in ye world but their life follows not their saying /
and therefore they desire it privily in their heart / but yet that is the
precious Margarete and the high virtue that is hyd fro much people for their
presumpcion / get it who so may.

:Of the unstableness of man's heart and that our fynall intent in all things
should be to god. The.xxviiii. Chapitre.
MI son / look that thou believe not thine own affection / for it changes
often from one to an other as long as thou lyuest thou shall be subject to
change habilyte whether thou wylt or not / as now glad / now sorrowful /
now pleased / now dyspleased / now devout / now undevout / now lusty /
now slouthful now heavy / now lightso^e. But a wife man that is well taught
in ghostely travail stands stable in all such things and forseth little
what he feleth / ne of what side the wind of unstableness blows / but all the
inte^te and study of his mind is how he may most profit in virtue and
finally come to the most fruyteful and most blessed end. By such an hoole
intent fully directed to god / many a man abide steadfast and stable in him
self among many aduersytes / and the more pure and the more clean that his
intent is / the more stable shall he be in every storm. But alas for sorrow
the eye of man's soul is anon derked / for it beholds lyghtely delectable
things that come of the world and of the flesh / in so much that there is
seldom found any person that is free and clear fro the venymous desire of
herynge of some tales or of some other fantasies / and that be their own
seeking. In such manner came the Jews in to Bethany / to Martha / and to mary
magdalene / not for the love of our lord Jesus but for to se Lazar whom he had
raised fro death to life / wherefore the eye of the soul is to be kept full
bright that it be always pure and clean / and that it be above all passing
things holy dyrected to god the which grant us to. AMEN.

How our lord God sauoureth to his lover swetely above all things: and in all
things The.xxxix. Chapitre.
OVre Lord is to me all in all / and says he is so / what would I more have /
or what can I more desire.:O this is a sauoury world: and a sweet to say that
our Lord is to me all in all. But that is to him that loves the word and not
the world. To him that understands this word / is said enough but yet to
repete it often is liking to him that loves / I may therefore more plainly
speak of this matter and say / lord wha^ thou art present to me: all thing is
plesaunte and liking / but when thou art absente all thing is grievous and
greatly myslykynge / when thou co^mes^e thou makeste mine heart restfull and
bryngest in to it a new joy / thou makeste thy lover to feel and understand
the truth and to have a true judgment in all things and in all things to
laud the and praise the. O lord without the nothing may be long liking ne
pleasant / for if any thing should be liking and sauoury it must be through
help of thy grace and be tempered with the spicerie of thy wisdom. To him to
whom thou sauourest well: that shall not sauoure well. And to him that thou
sauoureste not well unto what may be joyful or liking. But worldly wise men
and they that sauoure flesshely delytes fail of this wisdom / for in worldly
wisdom is found great vanyte / and in flesshely pleasures is ever lasting
death. Therefore they that follow the lord by dispisyng of the shorde And by
perfyte mortifye^ge of their fleshely lusts / be known to be very wise / for
they be led fro vanyte to troth / and fro flesshly liking to spiryuall
clennes. To such persons God sauoureth wonder sweet. And what so ever they
find creatures / they refer it all to the laud and to the praysynge of
their creatoure / for they se well that there is great difference betwyxt the
creature and creatoure eternyte and time: and betwyxte the light made / and
the light unmade. O everlasting light far passing all things that are
made. Send down the beams of thy lyghtenyngs / from above and purifye
glad / and clarify in me all the inward parties of my heart. Quycken my
spirit with all the powers thereof that it may cleue fast and be joined to the
in joyful gladness of ghostely rauysshynges: O when shall that blessed hour
come that thou shalt vysyte me and glad me with thy blessed presence / so
that thou be to me all in all. As long as that gift is not given to me / that
thou be to me all in all / there shall be no full joy in me. But alas for sorrow
mine old man that is my fleshely lykinge / yet lives in me and is not yet
fully crucified nor parfitely deed in me / for yet strives the flesh
strongely against the spirit and moves great inward battle against me /
and suffers not the kingdom of my soul to live in peace / but thou good
lord that haste the lordeshype over all the power of the sea / and doste
assuage the stremes of his flouinges. Arise and help me / break down the
power of mine enemies which always move this battle in me. Show the greatness
of thy goodness / and let the power of thy right hand be glorified in me for
there is to me none other hope nor refuge / but in the only my lord / my god
to whom be joy honor / and glory euerlastyngly. Amen.

:That there is no full suretye fro temptacyon in this life The.xl. Chapitre
Our lord says to his servant thus / thou shalt never be seker fro
temtacyon and tribulacyon in this life. And therefore armoure spirytuall shall
always as long as thou lyuest be necessary for the. Thou art among thine
enemies and shall be troubled and vexed with them on every side: and but thou
use in every place the shield of pacyence thou shall not long keep the
vnwou^ded And over that if thou set not thy heart strongly in me with a ready
will to suffer all things pacyently for me / thou may not long bear this
ardoure ne come unto the reward of blessed saints. It behooves the therefore
ma^ly to pass over many things and to use a strong hand against all the
obieccyons of the enemy To the ouercomer is promised Angels fode and to him
that is overcome is left much mysery. If thou seek rest in this life? how
shalt thou than come to the rest everlasting. Set not thy self to have rest
here / but to have pacyence / and seek the true southfaste rest / not in earth
but in heaven / not in man ne in any creature but in god only where it is. For
the love of god thou ought to suffer gladly al things / that is to say: all
labors / sorrows / te^ptacions: vexacyons / anguyshes / nedenes / sykenes /
injuries / evil saynges: repreuynges / oppressyons / confusions / correccions
/ and dispysynges. These help a man greatly to virtues: these prove the true
knight of Christ / and make ready for him the heavenly crown / and our lord
shall yield him again everlasting reward for his short labor / and
infynyte glory for his transytory confusyon. Troweste thou that thou shall have
always spiritual confortes after thy will. Nay nay my saints had the^ not /
but many great grefs and diverse temptacyons and great desolacions / but they
were all with pacyence and more trusted in me than in the^ self / for they
knew well that the passions of this world be not able of them self to get the
glory that is ordained for the^ i^ the kingdom of heaven. Will thou look to
have anon that other before the might uneaths get: before great wepynges
and labors. Abide pacyently the coming of our lord / do manfully his
bidding / be conforted in him / mystruste him not / ne go not back fro his
service for pain ne for dread / but lay forth thy body and soul constauntly
to his honor in all good bodyly and ghostly labors. And he shall reward the
again most plentuously for the good travail / and shall be with the and
help the in every trouble that shall befall unto the / so must it be. Amen.

:Against the vain iugementes of man. The.xli. Chapitre
MI son / fire thy heart steadfastly in god / and dread not the judgment of
man where thine own conscience witnesses the to be innocent and clear. It is
right good and blessed / sometime to suffer such sayenges / and it shall not be
grievous to a meke heart which trusts more in God than in him self / many
folk can say many things / and yet little faith is to be given unto their
sayenges / and to please all men it is not possible. For though saint Poule
labored all that he might to have pleased all people in god / and did to all
men all that he could for their salvation / yet nevertheless he could not let
/ but that he was sometime iuged of other. He did for the edyfyenge and health
of other as much as in him was: but that he should not sometime be iuged of
other or not be despised of other / he could not let. Wherefore he committed
all to god that knows al thing and armed him self with pacyence and mekenes
against al things that might be untruly spoken against him. And nevertheless
sometime he answered again lest that by his science hurt or hynderau^ce might
have growe^ to other / what art thou than that dredest so sore a mortal man.
This day he is / and to morrow he appears not dread god and thou shall not
need to dread man / what may man do with the in words or injuries / he
hurts him self more than the / and in the end he shall ne fle / the
judgment of God what so ever he be / have always good before the eye of thy
soul / and strive not again by multiplyeng of words. And if thou seem for a
time to suffer confusyon / that thou haste not deserved / dysdayne thou not
therefore / nor through inpacyence / minyshe not thy reward. But rather lift
up thy heart to God in heaven for he is able forto deliver the from all
confucyon and wrongs / and to reward every man after his deserte and much
more than he can deserve.

(...) get this fredome of spirit that I speak of pray for it / study for
it / and always desire it in thy heart that is to say that thou may clearly
be spoiled / and byratre of all propertye and of thine own will / and that
thou being naked of al worldly things may follow me that hongeked for the
upon the cross / and that thou may dye to thy self and to al worldly
things also / as in thy love and blessedly to live to me. Tha^ if thou do thus
all vanyues and all vain fantasies / and all superfluous cures of the world
and of the flesh shall fail and fade / and goo away Than also immoderate
dread and inordynate love shall dye in the / and thou shalt blessedly live in
me and I in the. Amen.

:How a man shall rule him self in outward things / and how he ought to call
to god for help in all perils and dangers. The.xliiii. Chapitre.
Our lord Jesus says to his servant thus. Thou oughteste to take heed
dilyge^tly that i^ every place / in every deed / and in every outward
occupacyon that thou doste: thou be inwardly fre in thy soul and have the rule
over thy self / and that all things be under the as in thy sone / and thou
not under them / but that thou be the Lord and governor over thy deeds: not
as a servant or a bondsman but rather exempted as a true Hebrew / that is to
say As a true christen man going in to the nombre and into the fredome of the
children of god / which stand upon things present / and look toward things
everlasting / and behold things transitory with their life eye: and things
everlasting with their right eye / whom worldly goods can not draw down to
the love of them / but they rather draw worldely goods to serve: in such
wise as they be ordained to of god / and as they be instytuted to do by the
high maker of all things which leueth nothing inordinate in his creatures.
Also if thou stand in every adventure / and doubt that shall happen to the not
to the judgment of thy outward apparaunce / but anon in every such do^^^
thou entreste in to thine own soul by devout prayer as Moses did in to the
tabernacle to ask counsel of god. Thou shalt here anon the answer of our
Lord which shall instruct the sufficiently in many things both present and
for to come. It is red that Moses had always recourse to the tabernacle of god
for doutes and questyons to be assoyled and that he there asked the help of
god through devout prayer for the perils and dangers as well of him self
as of the people. So shuldeste thou enter i^ to the secret tabernacle of thine
own heart / and there ask i^wardly with good devotion the help of god in all
such doutes and perils. We read that Iosue and the children of Israel were
deceived of the Gabaonites because they give light credence to their sayenges
and did not first ask counsel of god as they should have done / and so by
the fair words of the Gabaonites and through a false pite Iosue and the
children of Israel were illuded and greatly deceived.

That a man should not be importune in his business. The.xliiii. Chapitre.
MI son says our lord committee always thy cause to me / and I shall well
dyspose it for the / when time shall come / abide mine ordinance and directyon
/ and thou shalt find thereby great profit and help. O lord gladly will I
committee all things to the: for it is little that I can do for my self /
would to God that I did not cleue to desires of worldely things / but that I
might always offer my self holy to thy will: and pleasure.: My sone so it is
good for the to do: for sometime a man that trustethe much in him self / and
in his own will sets his mind much for to bring about this thing or
that as he desires. But when he has attained that he desires / than he
begins to feel all otherwise of it than he did before / for the affeccyons
and desires of man be not always one / but dryueth a man often fro one thing to
an other. Therefore it is no small thing a man fully to forsake him self
though it be in right little and small things. For truly the very perfeccyon
of man is a perfyte denieng and a full forsakynge of him self. And such a man
is very fre and beloved of god. But the old auncye^t enemy the fend which
resysteth goodness all that he may. Cease not long fro temptacyon but day
and night he makes grievous assautes: to se if ^e may catch any unware person
in to his snare of deceyte. Therefore wake ye and pray yet that ye be not
deceived by temptacyon.

:That man has no goodness of him self / and that he may not right fully
glorify him self in any thing. The.xlv. Chapitre.
O Lord what is man that thou vouchestsafe to have mind on him: or what has
he done for the: that thou will visyte him with thy grace / and what may he
complain although thou sometime forsake him / or what may I right wisely say
though thou grant me not that I ask / truly I may well think and say
thus. I am naught / ne I have no goodness of my self but in all things I am of
my self all in sufficient and go to naught / and but I be helped of the and be
inwardely informed and taught by the: I shall be all holy slothful and to all
thing unprofitable O lord thou art always one / ever shalt be one / always
good: always right wise and holy / well ryhhtwysely and blessedly disposyng all
things after thy wisdom / but I wretch that always am more ready and more
prone to evil tha^ to good / and not I always abiding in one / for.vii. times
be changed upon me. Nevertheless it shall be better with me when it shall
please the to put to thy helping hand / for thou only art he that without
man may help me: and so may thou conferme me and stable me in the that
mine heart shall not so lightly be changed fro the / but that it may be holy
fixed in the and finally to rest in the. And verily if I could cast away fro
me al man's comfort either for getting of devotion / or for I am compelled
thereto of necessyte for that I find no conforte in man / than might I well
trust in thy grace to have of the new visitacions / and new heavenly
consolacyons / but I confess it for truth / that I am unworthy to have any
such consolacyons / and I thank the as often as any good thing comes to me
for all that is good comes of the. I am but of all vanyte and naught before
the / a vnconstaunte man and a feeble / and therefore whereof many I ryghtwysly
glorify my self or why should I look to be magnified / truly vaynglory is a
peryllous sekenes: a grievous pestilence and a right great vanite for it draws
a man fro the true joy that he should have in god and roubeth him clearly of
all heavenly grace. For when a man pleases him self he displeases the and
when he delyteth in man's praysinges he is depreued fro the true virtues / for
the true steadfast joy and gladness is to joy in the and not in him self / in
thy name / and not in his own virtue / ne in any creature. Therefore thy name
be praised and not mine / thy warkes be magnifyed and not mine / and thy
goodness be always blessed: so that nothing be given to me of the laud and
praysyng of man. Thou art my glory: and the joy of my heart. In the shall I
be glorified / and always shall I joy in the / and in my self nothing / but
in my infirmytes. Let the Jews seek glory among the^ self / but I will none
seek but that is only of the for all man's glory / all temporal honor and
worldely hyghnes to thy eternal glory compared is but as folysshenes / and a
great vanyte.: O troth / o mercy / o blessed Trinyte / to the be laud
honor and glory euerlastyngly. Amen.

How all temporal honor is to be despised. The.xlvi. Chapitre.
MI son take it not to no grieve though thou se other men honored and exalted
and thy self dispysed and set at naught if thou reyse up thy heart to me in
heaven / the dispytes of man in earth shall little grieve the. O lord we be here in
great derkenes / and sone are we deceived with vanyties / but verily if I
beheld my self well I should openly so that there was never wrong done to me
by any creature: ne that I have nothing whereof I may rightwisely compain. But
for as much as I have often sinned / and grievously offended against the.
Therefore all creatures be armed against me. To me therefore is due confusion
and dispyte / to the laud / honor / and glory. And but I can bring my
self to this point that I would gladly be despised and forsaken of all
creatures / and vt^erly to seem as naught in the world / I may not be
inwardly pacified ne stabled in the / ne spiritually be illumined / nor yet
fully be oned to the.

That our trust is not to be put in wordely people. The.xlvii. Chapitre.
MI son if thou set thy peace with any person for thine own pleasure or
worldly frendshype / thou shalt always be unstable / and never shall thou be
contented / but if thou have always recourse to the troth everlasting that is
god him self: than the death or going away of thy derest friend what so ever
he be shall little grieve the. The love of thy friend ought always to be referred
to me / and for me he is to be beloved how good and how profitable so ever he
seem unto the in this life / without me frendshype is naught worth / ne may not
long endure / ne that love is not true and clean that is not knytte by me.
Thou ought therefore to be so mortified to all such affecio^s of worldely
men / that in as much as in the is: thou woldeste coueyte to be without all
man's comfort. So much a man nygheth the more to God as he can withdraw him
self fro the world and from all worldly conforte / and so much the more he
asscendeth the higher to god as he can descend lower in him self / and as he
can were vile and abiecte in his own sight / he that ascribes any goodness to
him self ayenstandeth the gra^e of God and lets it to live in him / for the
grace of the holy ghost seeks always a meke and an humble heart / if thou
couldeste perfitly noughty thy self and holy avoid thy heart fro all create
love / than should I (says our lord) come to ye with great habundaunce of my
grace. But when thou lokest to creatures / than is ryghtwysely withdrawn fro
the: the sight of thy creatoure. Learn therefore to overcome thy self / for
the love of him that made the like to him self / and thou shall anon come to
great ghostely knowledge: how little so ever the thing be that a man loves if
he love it inordynately / it hyndreth him: and lets him greatly fro the true
and perfyte love that he should have unto God.

That we should eschew vain seculer conning. The.xlviii. Chapitre.
MI son says our Lord / let not fair and also subtle words move the /
for the kingdom of heaven standethe not in words / but in good virtuous
warkes.: Take heed unto my words / for they inflame the heart / and lyghten
the understanding and bring in also co^puncio^ of heart / for sins paste /
and cause also often times great heavenly conforte suddenly to come in to the
soul / read never in any scyente to the intent thou would be called wise
but study rather to mortify in the all styrrynges of sins as much as in the
is / and that shall be more profitable in the / than the knowledge of many hard
/ and subtle questions / wha^ thou have rest and understand many doutes / yet
nevertheless it behooves the to come to one that is beginning of all things
that is god him self / and else thy knowledge shall little avail the. I am he
that teaches a man conning / and give more vnderstandynhe to meke persons /
than can be taught by man's teaching. And he to whom I speak / shall sone
be made wise: and much shall he profit in spyrite / when pain and woe shall be
to them that only seek for curyous learning taking little head of the way
for to serve god. The time shall come when Christ lord of Angels / and
master of all masters shall appear to here the lesson of every creature and
to examyne the conscience of every person / and than shall Jerusalem that is
man's soul beserched with lanternes and lyghtnes of gods high knowledge:
and ryghtfull iugementes / and tha^ also shall be made open / the deeds and
thoughts of every man and all excuses and vain arguments shall cease and
utterly be set aparte. I am he also that suddenly at a point illumyne / and
lift up a meke soute / that it shall be made able to take and to receive in
short time more perfitly the true reason of the wisdom of God / than an other
that studyeth.x. years in scoles and lacks mekenes. I teach without sound
of words without desire of oppynyons / without desire of honor / and
without strife and arguments.:: And I am he that teaches all the people to
despise erthely things / to loath things that he present / to seek and to
sauoure eternal things / to fle honors / to bear pacyently al evil words
and spekynges / to put their trust holy (...) me / nothing to coueyte
without me / and above all thing brenningly to love me. And some folks
through an inward love that they have had to me: have learned many great
things and have spoken many high mysteryes of my godheed.: They profit more
in forsakynge all thing / than in studienge for high and subtle learning. But
to some men I speak comen things / to some special things / to some I appear
swetely in signs and fygures / and to some I give great understanding of
scripture and open to them high secret mysteries. There is in books one voice
and one lettre that is red / but it enformeth not all persons alyke / for I am
within secretly hyd in the lettre the teacher of troth the sercher of man's
heart / ye knower of thoughts the promoter of good warkes and the rewarder of
all men after as my wisdom and goodness iugeth them to have deserved and none
otherwise.

:That we should not regard much outward things / ne pondre but little the
judgment of man. The.xlix. Chapitre.
MI sone it is profi^able to the to be ignorant in many things / and to
think thy self as deed to the world and to whom at the world is crucyfied.
And thou must also as with a de^e care let many things pass as thou neither
herd them ne saw them and to think on such things as shall cause in the an
inward peace in soul. It is also more profitable to the that thou turn the
eye of thy soul fro things that displease the and to let every man hold his
opinyon therein as him seems best / rather than to strive again with froward
words. And truly if thou were well stabled in God and beheldeste well his
iugementes thou shuldeste lightly be content to be iuged of other and to be
overcome of other as our lord Jesus was for the in time of his passion. O lord
since it is true that thou sayste what shall become of us that head ^o much
wordly things and be weep so greatly a little temporal loss / and we labor
and run for worldly profit with all our myhht / but our spirytuall profit
and the health of our own souls we little regard. Such things as little or
nothing profyteth us in much set by / but that / that is most necessary to
us is nyghe forgotten / for why all men run gladly to outward things. And
truly but they shortly turn back again / they shall gladly rest still in
them / which in the end shall be to them great peril: and danger.

That men be not always to be beloved / for that they so lyghtely offend in
words. The..l. Chapitre.
Lord send help unto me in all my troubles: and vexacyons / for man's help
is litel worth / how often have I not found frendshype where I thought I
should have found it. And how often have I found it where I lest presumed to
have found it / where it is a vain thing to trust in man / for the true and
sothfast trust and health of ryghtwyse me^ is only in the. Blessed be thou
lord therefore in all things that happens unto us / for we be weyke and
unstable: sone deceived / and sone changed fro one thing to an other / who may
so wately and so assuredly keep him self in every thing that he ne shall
sometime fall into some deceyte or in to some perplexyte / truly very few /
but he that does trust in the and that seeks the with a true and clean
heart / slydeth not so lightly fro the. And if it happen him to fall in to any
trouble or perple^ite what ^o ever i^ be / and how grievous so ever it be / he
shall anon either be delivered by the: or be conforted by the / for thou
dydest never forfake him that trusts in the. It is right hard to find so
true and so faithful a friend that will persevere with his friend in all his
troubles / but thou Lord art most faithful in all things and like to the
none can be found. O how well sauoured that holy soul in ghostely things
that said thus. My mind is stablyshed in god / and is fully grounded in
Christ. Truly if it were so with me the dread of man should not so lightly
enter in to me / ne other men's words should not so sone move me / who may
force all things / or who may preue^te all euylls that are to come / and if
things for se^e do it often times great hurt / what shall tha^ tho things do
that be not forsene. But why have not I wretch better seen to my self / and
why have I so lightly believed other me^nes saynges truly for we be men and that
^ut frail men though we be esteemed and thought of many to be as Angels in our
conversation / whom may I believe but only the. Thou art the troth that
deceyueste no man: nor may not be deceived. And on the other side every man
is a liar weyke and unstable and slydynge most especially in words / so that
uneaths it may be believed that seems openly to be true / how prudently
therefore haste thou warned us to beware of the lyghtnes of man / and that our
familier servants may be our enemies so y^ it is not to be believed though^
one will say lo here is thy friend / or there is thy friend / for I am taught
with mine own heart: but would to god it might be as a warnyng to me and not
to my more folly. Some say to me beware / be ware / keep close to thy self that
I shall show to the. And when I speak it close and believed it to be secret:
he can not be secret in that him self desired but anon he betrayeth both him
self and me / and goth his way fro such tales and fro such unstable men /
lord defend me / that I fall not in to their hands / ne that I never comyt
any such things. A true word and a stable lord give in to my mouth / and a
deceytfull tongue drive far away fro me / for that I would not have done to my
self / I ought to be ware that I do it that to none other. O how good and
how peaceful is it to keep scylence of other me^nes words and deeds and not
to give full credence till the troth be tried and not to report lyghtely to
other all that we here or se. Ne to open our heart fully but to very few / and
to seek the all way that are the beholder of man's heart / and not for to be
moved with every flake of words / but for to desire in heart that all thing
in us inwardely and outwardely may be fulfilled after thy will / how sure a
thing is it also for the keeping of heavenly grace / to fle the conuersacyon of
wordly people all that we may and not to desire things that seem outwardely to
be pleasant: and liking. But with all the study of our heart to seek such
things as bring in feruoure of spirit and amendment of life. It has been
truly a great hurt to many persons a virtue known and over tymely praised /
and on the contrarywyse it has been right profitable to some: a grace kept in
scylence / and not lyghtely reported to other in this frail life that is full
of te^ptacyon and preuy envy.

That we shall put all out confydence in god when evil words be spoken unto
us. The.li. Chapitre.
MI son says our Lord / stand strongly and trust faithfully in me what
be words but wind / they fle in the heir / but they hurt never astone on
the ground / and if thou know thy self not gyltye / think that thou wylt
suffer gladly such words for god. It is but a hasty word since thou art yet
stable to ^uffre hard strokes. But why is it that so little a thing goes so
nygh the heart / but that thou art yet fleshely and carnal and hedest to please
men more than thou should. And because thou dredest to be dispysed / thou
wylt not gladly be reproved for thine offenses / and thou serchest therefore
busily and with great study how thou may be excused. But behold thy self
well and thou shall se that the world yet lives in the and a vain love also
to please man. Wha^ thou refusest to be rebuked and punyshed for thy defautes /
it appears euydently that thou art not yet sothfastly meke / ne that thou art
not yet deed to the world nor the world to the net truly crucified But here
my words and thou shalt not need to care for the words of ten thousa^de men.
Lo if al things were said against the that might be most malicyously / and
untruly feigned against the / what should they hurt if thou suffered them to
ouerpasse and go away / truly no more than a straw under thy foot / and one
hear of thy head they might not take fro the. But he that has not a man's
heart withinforth / ne sets not God before the eye of his soul / is sone
moved with a sharp word / when he that trusts in me / and will not stand
unto his own judgment shall be fre fro all man's dread for I am the Judge that
knows all / secrets. I know how every thing is done and I know also both
him that does the wrong and him that it is done to.: Of this thing is wrought
and by my sufferaunce it is come about that the thoughts of men's hertes may
be known / and when the time comes I shall judge both the innocente and him
that is gylty. But first through my ryghtwyse examinacyon I will prove the^
both The wytnes of man often times deceyueth but my iugeme^te is always true and
shall not be subverted / and how be it: it is sometime hyd and not known but
to few / yet it is true and erreth not / ne yet may not err / though in the
sight of some unwise persons it seems not so.: Therefore in every doubt it
behooves for to rene to me / and not to leave much unto thine own reason /
but with every thing that I shall send the to be content / for a ryghtwyse
man is never troubled with any thing that I shall suffer to fall unto him. In
so much that though a thing were untruly spoken against him / he should not
much care for it. Ne he should not much joy though he were sometime
reasonably excused / for he thinks always that I am he that sercheth man's
heart / and that I judge not after the outward apparaunce / for often times it
shall be found in my sight worthy to be blamed that in man's sight seems
much worthy to be praised. O lord god most ryghtwyse Judge strong and
pacyente / which knoweste the fraylte / and the malice of man / be thou my
strength and my hole conforte in all necessyties / for mine own conscience
Lord suffyseth me not / for thou knoweste in me that I know not. And therefore
i^ every reprofe I ought always to meken my self / and pacyently to suffer all
things in charity after thy pleasure / forgive me lord as often as I have not
so done / and give me grace of greater sufferau^ce in time to come. Thy mercy
is more profitable and more sure way for me unto the gettinge of pardon and
forgyuenes of my sins tha^ a trust in mine own warkes through defense of my
derke conscience. And though I dread not my conscience / yet I may not
therefore iustyfy my self: for thy mercy removed and taken away / no man may
be iustiyfyed: ne appear ryghtwyse in thy sight.

:How all grievous things in this life are gladely to be suffered for winning
of this life that is to come. The.lii. Chapitre.
MI sone (says our lord) be not broken by impacye^ce with the labor that
thou have taken for my sake / ne suffer thou not trybulacyons to cast the in
despair nor in to unreasonable heaviness / ne anguyshe in no wise / but be thou
conforted and strengthed in every chance by my promyses and behestes / for I
am able and of power to reward the and other my servants haboundauntly more
than yet an think or desire / thou shalt not labor long here ne always be
grieved with heaviness / tarry a while my promysses and thou shall shortly se an
end of all thy troubles / one hour shall come when all thy labors and
troubles shall cease and truly that hour will shortly come for all is short
that passes with time. Do therefore as thou doste / labor busely and
faithfully in my vyneyarde / and I shall shortly be thy reward: write / read
/ sing / mourn / be still and pray and suffer gladly aduersyte / for the
kingdom of heaven is more worth than is all these things / and much more
greater things than they are: peace shall come one day that it is known to me
/ and that shall not be the day of this life / but a day everlasting with
infynite clerenes steadfast peace / and syker rest without ending. And than
thou shall not say / who shall deliver me from the body of this death ne thou
shall not need to cry. Woe is to me that my coming which is the kyngdo^e of
heaven is thus prolo^ged. For death shall tha^ be distroyed and health shall be
without end of ^ody and of soul / in so much that no manner of vnrestfulnes
shall be / but blessed joy and most swetnes / and most fairest company. O if thou
saw the everlasting crowns of my saints in heaven / in how great joy and
glory they are that sometime seemed to be vile persons and as me^dispysable in
the world / thou shuldeste anon meken thy self low to the ground / and
thou should rather coueyt to be subject unto al men / than to have
soueraynte over any one person / and thou should not desire to have mirth
and solace in this world / but rather tribulacyon and pain / and thou
should than account it as a great winning / to be dispysed and to be taken
as naught among the people. O if these things sauoure well to the and depely
perced in to thy heart / thou should not ones dare complain for no manner of
trouble that should befall unto the. Are not all paynfull things and most
grievous labors gladly to be suffrered for the joys everlasting? yes verily:
for it is no little thing to win or lose the kingdom of heaven lift up thy
face therefore into the heaven and behold how I and all my saints that be with
me in heaven: had in this world great battle and conflycte / and now they
joy with me and be conforted in me and be sure to abide with me / and to dwell
with me in the kyngedome of my father without ending. Amen.

Of the day of eternyte / and of the myseryes of this life. The.liii. Chapitre.
O Blessed mansyon of the heavenly city. O most clerest day of eternite: whom
the night may not darken / but the high troth that god is illumineth and
clereth: the day always merry / always syker / and never chaungynge his state to
the contrary / would to god that this day might ones appear and shine upon us
/ and that these te^porall things were at an end. This blessed day shines to
Saints in heaven with everlasting bryghtnes and clearly / but to us pilgrims
in earth it shyneth not but a far of as through a myrroure or glass. The
heavenly citeze^s know well how ioyus this day is. But we outlawes: the
children of Eve weep and wayle the bytternes and tedyousnes of this day that is
of this present life short and evil full of sorrows anguyshes: where a man
is often times defouled with sin / encombred with passions / inquyeted with
dredes / bounden with charges / busyed with vanites / blinded with errors /
ouercharged with labors / vexed with temptacyons overcome with delytes and
pleasures of the world: and grievously tormented sometime with penury and need.:
O when shall the end come of all these miseryes / and when shall I be clearly
delivered fro the bondage of sin: when shall I only lord have mind on the
and fully be made glad and merry in the / when shall I be fre without lettynge
and be in parfyte lyberty without grieve of body and of soul wha^ shall I have
sad peace without trouble / peace within and without and on every side steadfast
and syker. O lord Jesus wha^ shall I stand and behold the and have full sight
and contemplacion of thy glory / and when shalt thou be to me all in all /
and wha^ shall I be with the in thy kingdom that thou have ordained to thy
elect people fro the beginning. I am left here poor and as an outlawe in
the land of mine enemies / where daily be batayles and great misfortunes.
Comfort my exyle aswage my sorrow / for all my desire cries to the / it is to
me a grievous bourden what so ever the world offers me here to my solace I
desire to have i^warde fru^cion in the / but I can not atteyne thereto I coueyte
to cleave fast theue^ly things but temporal things and passions
unmortified: pull me always downwarde in mind I would be above all temporal
things / but whether I will or not I am compelled through mine own defaute to
be subject unto my flesh / thus I most wretched man fight in my self / and
am made grievous to my self / whiles my spirit desires to the upward and my
flesh downwarde. O what suffer I inwardely when in my mind I behold heavenly
things: and a great multitude of carnal thoughts enter into my soul.
Therefore lord be not long fro me / ne depart not in thy wrath fro me thy
servant* send to me the lyghtnes of thy grace and break down in me all
eternal thoughts Send forth the darts of thy love and break therewith all
fantasies of the enemy. Gather my wytnes: and powers of my soul to gether in
the. Make me forgette all worldly things / and grant me to cast away and
holy to dispyse all fantasies of sin / help me therefore thou everlasting
truth that no worldly vanite here after have power in me. Come also thou
heavenly swetnes and let all bytternes of sin fle far fro me / pardone me
and mercyfully forgive me when I think in my prayer of any thing but of the /
for I confess for troth that in time paste I have used my self very vnstably
therein / for many times I am not there where I stand or sytte / but rather I
am therefore there where my thoughts led me / for there I am where my thought
is and there as my thought is accustomed to be there is that that I love / and
that often times commethe into my mind that by custom pleases me best / and
that most delyteth me to think upon. Wherefore thou that art everlasting
troth sayste openly / there as thy treasure is: there is thy heart.: Wherefore
if I love heaven: I speak gladly of heavenly things / and of such things as be
of god / and that perteyne most unto his honor and to the glorifyenge of and
worshyppynge of his holy name. And if I love the world: I joy anon at
worldly felicite and sorrow anon at his aduersite / if I love the flesh I
ymagyne often times that pleases the flesh / and if I love my soul I delight
much to speak and to here of things that be to my soul health. And so what
so ever I love: of them I gladly here and speak / and bear the images of them
often in my mind / blessed is that man that for the lord forgets all
creatures and lerneth truly to overcome him self / and with the feruoure of
spirit crucifieth his flesh / / so that in a clean and in a p^re conscience
he may offer his prayers to the and he worthy to have company of blessed
Angels. All erthely things excluded fro him and fully set aparte. Amen.

:Of the desire of everlasting life / and of the great reward that is
promised to them that strongely fight against sin. The.liiii. Chapitre.
MI sone when thou felest y^ a desire of everlasting bliss is given to the and
that thou couetist to go out of the tabernacle of thy mortal body / y^ thou
might clearly without shadow behold my clerenes. Open thine heart and with ye
desire of thy soul take that holy i^spiracio^: and yield most large thanks to
the high goodness of god that so worthily does to the / so benyngly vysyteth the
/ so brennyngly styrreth the / and so myghtely bears the up: that through
thine own burden thou fall not down to erthely lykynges / and think not that
that desire comes of thy self or of thine own werkynge / but rather that it
comes of the gift of grace / and of a lovely beholdynge of god upon the /
that thou shuldeste profit thereby in mekenes and virtue / and that thou
should also p^pare the to be ready against an other time for batayles that are
for to come / and the more surely to cleue to god with all the desire and
affecyon of thy heart and to study with all thy power how thou may most
purely and most devoutly serve him / and take heed of this common prouerbe^ The
fire does often brenne / but the flame does not assende without some smoke. So
in likewise the desire of some men draws to heavenly things / and yet they be
not all free fro the smoke of carnal affeccio^s / and therefore they do it not
always purely for the honor and love of god that they ask so desyrously of
him. Such often times is thy desire that thou show to be so importune for
that desire is not clean and perfyte that is myxte with thine own co^modyte.
Ask therefore not that is delectable and profitable to the / but that is
acceptable and honor to me / for if thou do well and judge a right / thou
shall prefer my ordinance and my will before all thy desires and before all
things that may be desired beside me. I know well thy desire. Thou would
now be in the lybertye of the glory of the sons of god now the everlasting
house and the heavenly country full of joy and glory delyteth the much: but
that time comes not yet / for there is yet an other time to come / that is to
say: a time of labor and of proof / thou desyrest to be fulfilled with the
high goodness in heaven / but thou may not yet come thereto. I am the full
reward of man / abide me until I shall come / and thou shalt have me to thy
reward. Thou art yet to be proved here upon earth / and more thoroughly to be
assailed in many things / some comfort shall be given the / but the fulness
thereof shall not yet be granted. Be thou therefore conforted in me / and be
thou strong as well in doing as in sufferynge things contrary to thy will.
It behooves the to be clothed in my blood / and to be changed in to a new
man / and thou must often times do that thou would not do / and that yt thou
would do thou must forsake and leave undone. That shall please other shall go
well forward / and that shall please the shall have no speed / that other me^
say shall be well herd / and that thou shall say shall be set at naught. Other
shall ask and have their asking / thou shalt ask and be denied. Other
shall be great and have great laud and praise of the people / and of the no
word shall be spoken. To other this office or that shall be committed and thou
shall be iuged unprofitable in every thing / for these things and other like:
nature will murmr and grudge / and thou shalt have a great battle in thy
self if thou bear them secret in thy heart without complaining and
myssaynge. Nevertheless in such things and otherlyke my faithful servants
are wont to be proved / how they can deny them self and how they can in all
things breyke their own wylles / and there is nothing that thou shall need so
much to overcome thy self in / as to learn to be contented / not to be set any
price by in the world / and to suffer such things as be most contrary to thy
will especyally when such things as in thy syghte seem unprofitable be
commanded to be done. But my son consider well the profit fruit of all
these labors the short end and the great reward / and than thou shall
feel no grefe ne pain in all thy labors / but the most swetest conforte of
the holy ghost through thy good will / and for that little will that thou
forsakest here thou shalt always have thy will in heaven where thou shall have
all that thou causte or may desire. There shall thou have full possession of
all goodness without dread to lose it. There thy will shall be ever one with my
will / and it shall coueyte no strange nor private things. There no man shall
resyste the / no man shall compain on the / no man shall let the / nor no man
shall witstande the / but all things that thou ca^ste desire shall be there
present and shall fulfill all the powers of my soul unto the full. There shall I
yield glory for reproues / and a palle of laud for the heaviness / and for the
loweste place here / a sete in heaven for ever. There shall appear the fruit of
obedyence* the labor of penance shall joy / and the humble subieccion
shall be crowned gloriously: bow the therefore mekely now under every man's
hand / and force little who says this or who commands this to be done. But
with all thy study take heed yt whether thy p^late or thy fellow or any other
lower than thou ask any thing of the or will any thing to be done by the /
that thou take it away unto the best / and with a glad will study to fulfill
it / let this man seek this thing and an other that / and let this man joy in
this thing and an other in that what so it be and let them be landed and
praised a thousand times / but joy thou neither in this thing nor in that /
but only in thine own contempt and dyspysinge / and in my will for to be
fulfilled and whether it be by life or death that I may always be landed and
honored in the and by the. Amen.

:How a man that is desolate ought to suffer him self holy unto god. The.lv.
Chapter
Lord holy father / be thou blessed now and ever / for even as thou will so
it is done / and what that thou doeste is always well / let me thy pooreste
seruau^te and most unworthy joy in the and not in my self ne in nothing else
beside the / for thou lord art my gladness / thou art my hope / my crown /
my joy / and all my honor. What has my servant but that he has of the and
that without his deserte all things be thine that thou haste given and made.
And I am poor and have been in trouble and in pain ever fro my yoth. and my
soul has been in great heaviness with weeping and tears and sometime it has
been troubled in it self through many fold passions that come of the world
and of the flesh. Where fore lord I desire that I may have of the joy of
thy inward peace: and I do ask the rest of thy chosen children that he fed
and norysshed of the i^ the light of heavenly confortes / but without thine
help I can not come thereunto. If thou lord give peace or if thou give
inward joy / my soul shall be anon full of heavenly melody and be devout and
serue^t in thy lauds and praysynges / but if thou with draw thy self from me
as thou haste sometime done / than may not thy servant run the way of thy
commandments as he did first / but than he is compelled to bow his knees /
and to knock his breast / for it is not with him as it was before wha^ the
la^terne of thy ghostly presence shone upon his hedde / and that he was
defended under the shadow of thy mercy from all perils and dangers. O right
wise father ever to be praised / the time is come that thou wylt thy servant
be proved. And ryghtwysely is it done that I shall now suffer somewhat for the /
now is the hour come that thou haste known ^t^ the beginning that thy
servant for a time should outwardly be set at naught and inwardly to live to
the: and that he should a little be despised in the sight of the world and be
broken with passions and sykenes / that he might after rise with the in to a
new light and be claryfyed and made glorious in like kingdom of heaven O holy
father thou have ordained it so to be / and it is done as thou haste commanded
/ this is thy grace to thy friend / to suffer and to be troubled in this world
/ for thy love / how often so ever it be / and of what person so ever it be /
and in what manner so ever thou suffer it to fall unto him with out thy counsel
and prouydence ne with out cause no thing is done upon earth. O it is good to
me Lord that thou haste mekened me that I may thereby learn to know the
ryghtwyse iugementes / and put fro me all manner of presumpcyon and hyghnes of
heart / and it is very profitable to me that confusyon has covered my face
that I may learn thereby to seek for help and socour to the rather than unto
man. And I have thereby learned to dread thy secret and terrible iugementes
which scourgeste the ryghtwyse man with the sinner but not without equity and
justice. I yield thanks to the that thou haste not spared my sins / but
haste punyshed me with scourges of love / and haste sense me sorrows and
anguysshes within and without / so that there is no creature under heaven that
may confort me / but thou lord god the heavenly leche of man's soul which
strykeste and helest and bryngeste a man nyghe unto bodily death and after
r^storeste him to health again that he may thereby learn to know the lytelnes
of his own power and the more fully to trust in the. The dyscyplyne is fallen
upon me and thy rod of correccyon has taught me / and under that rode I
holy submyt me / stryke my back and my bones as it shall please the and make
me to bow my crooked will unto thy will / make me a meke and a humble dyscyple
as thou haste sometime done with me that I may walk all after thy will. To the I
committee my self and all mine to be corrected / for better it is to be
corrected by the here / than in times to come. Thou know all things and
nothing is hyd from the that is in man's conscience. Thou know things to
come before they fall / and it is not nedeful that any man reach the or warn
the of any thing that is done upon the earth. Thou knoweste what is spedful for
me and how much tribulacion helps to pourge the ruste of syn in me / do
with me after thy pleasure / and dysdayne not my sinful life to none so well
known as it is to the. Grant me lord that to know that is necessary to be
known / that to love that is to be loved that to praise yt hyghly pleases
the: that to regard that apereth precious i^ thy sight and that to refuse that
is vile before the Suffer me not to judge after my outward wits / ne to give
sentence after the hearing of vnco^nynge men / but in a true judgment to
descerne things vysible and unvisible / and above all things always to search
and follow their will and pleasure. The outward wits of men be often deceived
in their ingementes. And in like wise the lovers of the world be deceived
through living only of visible things / what is a man the better / for he is
taken better / truly nothing / for a deceytfull man deceyueth an other / a
vain man deceyueth an other / and a blind / and a feeble creature deceyueth an
other wha^ he exalts him / and rather confounds him tha^ prayseth him for
why / how much so ever a man be in sight of god / so much he is and no more
(says the meke saint Frau^ces) how holy and how virtuous so ever he be taken
in sight of the people.

That is good that a man give him self unto meke bodily labors / when he
feleth not him self disposed to high warkes of devotion. The.lvi. Chapter.
MI son / thou may not always stand in the high feruente desire of virtue
/ ne in the hygheste degree of contemplacyon / but thou must of necessyte
through the corrupcyo^ of the first sin sometime descend unto lowe^ things /
and against thy will and with great tedyousnes to bear the burden of this
corruptible body / for as long as thou herest this body of death / thou must
needs feel some grefe of heart / and thou shalt often times bewype and mourn
the burden of the fleshely felynges / and the contradiccyon of thy body unto
thy soul / for thou maiste not for the corrupcion thereof persevere in
spiritual studyes and in heavenly co^templacyon as thou would do / and tha^
it is good to the to fle to meke bodily labors and to exercise thy self in
good outward warkes / and in a steadfast hope and trust to abide my coming
and my new heavenly vysitacyons / and to bear thy exile and the drynes of thy
heart pacye^tly / till thou shall be visited by me again / and be delivered fro
all tediousnes and unquietness of mind / wha^ I shall come / I shall make the
forgete all thy former labors / and to have inward rest and quietness of
soul. I shall also lay before the ye flourishing medowe of holy scripture / and
thou shall with great gladness of heart in a new blessed felinge / feel the
very true understanding thereof / and thou shalt than ren quyckely the way of
my commandments / and than shalt thou say in great spirytuall gladness.
The passions of this world be not worthy of them self to bring us to the joy
that shall be showed us in the bless of heaven. To the which bless bring us
our lord Jesus. Amen.

That a man shall not think him self worthy to have conforte / but rather to
have sorrow and pain and the profit of the contricion. The.lvii. Chapitre.
Lord I am not worthy for to have thy consolacyon / ne any other spytuall
vysytacyon / and therefore thou doste right wisely unto me / when thou leuest me
very nedy and desolate / for though I might weep water of tears like to the sea. Yet were I not worthy to have thy consolacyon / for I am nothing worthy
to have but sorrow and pain / for I have so grievously and so often offended the
/ and in so many things greatly trespased against the. Therefore I may well
say and confess for truth that I am not worthy to have thy lest
consolacyon. But thou lord benyngne and merciful that wylt not thy works do
peryshe / to show the gretnes of thy goodness in the vessels of thy mercy
above all my merits or deserte / vouchesaufe sometime to conforte thy servant
more than I can think or deuyse. The consolacyons be not like to mentes fables
/ for they be in them self sothfaste and true / but what have I done lord
that thou wylt vouchesaufe to give me any heavenly co^solacyon. I know not that
I have done any thing well / as I should have done: but that I have always been
prone and ready to sin: and slow to amendment / this is true and I can not
deny it / for if I would deny it thou should stand against me / and no
man might defend me. What have I than deserved but hell and everlasting fire.
I confess for troth that I am worthy in this world all shame and dispyte /
and that it becomes not me to be conuersaunte with devout people. And
though it be grievous to me for to say thus (yet for the truth is so) I will
confess the troth as it is / and will openly reprove my self of my defaultes
that I may the rather optaine of thy mercy and forgyuenes / but what may I
tha^ say lord that thus am gylty and full of confusion / truly I have no
mouth ne taught to speak but only this word / I have sinned lord / I have
sinned / have mercy on me / forgive me and unknown me trespass / suffer me a
little that I may weep and wale my sins / or that I pass hence to the land
of darkness covered with the shadow of death. And what doste thou lord ask
much of such wretched sinner / but that he be contryte and meken him self for
his sin / for in true contricyon and mekenes of heart / is faude the very
hope of forgeuenes of syne and the troubled conscience is thereby clered / and
the grace before lost is recovered again. Man also is thereby defended fro the
wrath to come / and almighthy god and the penitente soul mete louyngly
together in holy kyssynges of heavenly love. A meke concricion of heart is to
the lord a right acceptable sacrifice / more swetely sauouryng in thy sight
tha^ brennyng enscence. It is also the precious oyntme^t that thou would
should be shede upon thy blessed fete / for a meke and a contryte heart thou
never dyspysest. This contricyon is the place of refuge fro the dread and
wrath of the enemy / and thereby is washen and cleansed / what so ever is
before misdone or that is defouled through sin in any manner.

That grace will not be myxte with love of worldy things. The.lviii. Chapter.
MI son: grace is a very precious thing / and will not be my^te with no
pryuate love / nor with worldely confortes. It behooves the therefore to cast
away all lettynges of grace if thou will have the gracyous gift thereof. Chose
therefore a secret place and love to be alone and keep the from ^eringe of
vain tales and fables / and offer to god devout prayers and pray hertely that
thou may^e have a contryte heart and a pure conscience. Think all the world
as naught and prefer my service before al other things / for thou may not
have mind on me and therewith all delight the^ transitory pleasures. It behooves
the therefore for to withdraw the fro thy de^este friends / and fro all thine
acquayntaunce / and to sequestre thy mind holy fro the inordynat desire of all
worldely conforte as much as thou may. Thus prayde saint Peter that all
christen people might hold them self as strangers and as pilgrims upon
earth / for than they should not set but little price by the conforte thereof. O
how sure a trust shall it be to man at his departing out of this world / to
feel inwardly in his soul / that no worldely love / ne yet the affection of no
passing or transitory thing has any rule in him But a weyke feeble person
newely turned to god may not so lyghtely have his heart severed from erthely
liking / nor the beastly man knows not ye fredome of a man that is inwardly
turned to god And therefore if a man will perfytely be spiritual and ghostely:
he must as well renounce strangers as kynsfolke / and specially before all
other / that he be most ware of him self if he ouerco^e him self parfytly /
he shall the sooner overcome all other enemies. The most noble and the most
perfyte victory is: a man to have yt victory of him self / he therefore that
holds him self so much subject / that the sensualyte obeys to reason: and
reason in all things obeys to me / he is the true ouercomer of him self and
the lord of the world. But if thou coueyte to come to that point: thou must
begin man fully / and set thy are to the rote of the tree / and fully to cut
away and to dystroye in the all the inordinate inclinacio^ that thou haste to
thy self or to any pryua^e or material thing / for of that vice that a man
loves him self inordinately / well nyghe depends all that ought groundly to
be dystroyed in man / and if that be truly overcome anon shall follow great
tranquylite and peace of conscience. But for as much as there be but few that
labor to dye to them self / ne to overcome them self perfytely / therefore
they lie still in their fleshely folynge / and worldely confortes / and may in
no wise rise up in spirit above the^ self / for it behooves him that will be
fre in heart and have contemplacion of me / to mortifye all his evil
inclinacions that he has to him self / and to the world / and not for to be
bound to any creature by any inordynate: or pryuate love.

:Of the diuersytes / and diverse mouynges between nature and grace. The.lix.
Chapter.
MI son take good head of the mocyons of nature: and grace for they be very
subtle and much contrary the one to the other / and hardely may they be known
a sondre / but it be by a ghostely man that through spirytuall grace is
inwardely lyghtened in soul. Every man desires some goodness and pretends
somewhat of goodness in all his words and deeds / and therefore under pretense of
goodness many be deceived. Nature is wy^e and full of decey^e / and draws many
to her / whom she often times snareth and deceives and ^uer beholds her own
welthe as end of he^ we^. But grace walks simply without deceit she
declyneth fro all evil she pretends no gyle / but all things she does
purely for god in whom ^y^a^ly she ^esteth. Nature will not gladly dye / ne
gladly be oppressed ne overcome ne will not be gladly under other ne be kept in
sub^ ^o but grace studieth how she may be mortified to the world / and to the
flesh ^ she resysteth sensualyte / she seeks to be subiec^e / she desires to
be overcome / she will not use her own lyberty / she loves to be holde^ under
holy discyplyne / and coueteth not to have lordeshype over any one creature but
to live and to stand always under the dread of god / and for hit love is always
ready to bow her self mekely under every creature. Nature labors for her
own profy^e and advantage / and much beholds what winning comes to her
by other.: But grace beholds not what is profitable to her self / but what
is profitable to many. Nature receives gladly honor and reverence: but grace
refers all honor and reverence unto god. Nature dredeth reprouynges and
dyspysynges / but grace ioyeth for the name of god to suffer them both and
takes them when they come as specyal gifts of god Nature loves ydelnes and
flesshely rest but grace can not be idle without doing some good deed / and
therefore seeks gladly some profitable labors. Nature desires fair things
and curious and abhors vile things and groce / but grace delyteth in meke
and simple things / she dispyseth not hard things / ne refuses not to be
glad in poor old clothyng and simple garments / nature beholds gladly
things temporal: she ioyeth at worldely wynnynges / is heavy for worldly
lesynges / and anon is moved with a sharp word / but grace beholds things
everlasting and trusts not to things temporal nor is not troubeled with
the loss of them / ne she is not grieved with a froward word for she has
laid a treasure in god and in ghostely things which may not peryshe. Nature
is covetous / and more gladly takes than gives: and loves much to have
propetie and pryuate things / but grace is pyteous and liberal to the poor /
she flees synguler profit / she is content with little and judges it more
blessed to give than to take. Nature inclyneth unto the love of creatures to
the love of the flesh / and unto vanites and re^nynges about and to se new
things in the world: but grace draws a man to the love of god and to the
love of virtues / she renounceth all creatures / she flies from the world /
she hates desires of the flesh / restrayneth liberte and wandrynges about /
and escheweth as much as she may to be seen among recourse of people. Nature
has gladly some outward solace wherein she may feleably delyght in her
outward wits / but grace seeks only to be comforted in god / and to
delyght her in his goodness above al things.: Nature does all things for her
own winning: and synguler profit / she may do nothing fre / but hops all
way to have like profit or better: or laud or favor of the people / and
coueyteth much that her deeds and warkes be greatly pondred and praised / but
grace seeks no temporal thing / ne none other reward for her hyre but only
god she will no more of temporal goodness than shall need for the getting of
the goods everlasting / and ca^eth not for the vain praise of the world.
Nature ioyeth greatly in many friends and kynstolkes / and is gloryfyed much
of a noble place of birth and of her noble blood and kynted / she ioyeth with
mighty men / she fl^tereth rich men and as merry with them that she thinks
like to her in noblenes of the world / but grace makes a man to love his
enemies she has no pride in worldely fre^des / she regards not the noblenes
of kynne / ne the house of her father / but if the more virtue be there / she
favors more the poor than the rich she has more compassyon of an
innoce^te than of a mighty man / she ioyeth ever in troth and not in falsehed
/ and always comforts good men more and more to profit and grow in virtue
and goodness and to seek daily more higher gifts of grace that they may through
good virtuous works be made like to the sone of god. Nature co^playneth anon
for wanting of a right little thing that she would have: or for a little
worldly heaviness / but grace beryth gladly all nedynes and wantinges of the
world Nature inclyneth all things to her self and to her own profit as
much as she may / she argues for her self: and stryueth and fyghteth for her
self. But grace renders al things to god of whom all things flows and
springs origynally / she ascrybeth no goodness to her self / ne presumes not
of her self / ne she stryueth not. ne prefers not her opinyon before other
me^nes / but in every sentence she submytteth her mekely to the eternal
wisdom and judgment of god. Nature coueyteth to know and to here new secret
things / she will that her warkes be showed outwardly and will have experience
of many things in the world by her outward wits / she desires also to be
known and to do great things in the world where of laud and p^aysinge may
follow / but grace ca^eth not for any new things ne for any curyous things:
what so ever they be / for she knows well that all such vanytes comes of
the corrupcyon of sin / and that no new thing may long endure upon earth /
she teached also ^o restrain the outward wits and to ^schew all vain
pleasure and outward shewi^g and mekely keeps se re^e things that in the
world were greatly to be meruayled and praised. And in every thing and in
every science she seeks some spiritual profit to her self / and laud and
honor to almighty God / she will not that her good de^es ne her inward
deuocio^ be outwardly known: but most desires that our lord be blessed in all his works which gives all things freely of his high excellent charity /
this grace is a light supernatural and a spiritual gift of God and it is the
proper mark and token of elect people: and an erneste penny of the
everlasting life / for it rauysheth a man fro love of ear^hly things to the
love of heavenly things / and of flesshely liver makes an heavenly person /
and the more that nature is oppressed and overcome the more grace is given /
and the soul through new gracyous visitacyons is daily reformed more / and
more unto the image of god.

:Of the corrupcyon of Nature and also of the worthynes of grace. The lx.
Chapitre.
O Lord god which haste made me to thine image and lykenes grant me this
grace that thou have showed to me to be so great and so necessary to the health
of my soul / that I may overcome this wretched nature which draws me always
to sin / and to thelesynge of mine own soul. I feel in my flesh the law
of sin fighting strongly against the law of my spirit: which ledeth me as
a thrall or a bondeman to obey to se^sualyte in many things and I may not
resyst the passions thereof / but thy grace do assyste me therein. I have
therefore great need of thy grace and that of the great habundaunce of thy
grace: if I should overcome this wretched nature which always fro my youth has
been ready and prone to sin / for after that nature was vis^ate and defouled
by the sin of the first man Adam / the pain thereof descended in to all his
posteryte so that: that nature which in the first creacyon was good and
ryghtwyse is now taken for sin and for corrupcion (so farforth) that the
mouynges that is now lef^e unto nature draws man always to evil. And that ^s
for this reason for the little strength and mouinge unto goodness that yet
remains in it is as a little sparkell of fire that is hyd and over hylde with
ashes / that is to say the natural reason of man which is all about
bylapped and ouerhylled with darkness of ignorance / which nevertheless has
yet power to judge betwyxte good and badde and to show the dystaunce and the
diuersyte betwyxte true and false: how be it that through weyknes of it self
it is not able for to fulfill all that it approves / ne has not sithe the
first sin of Adam the full light of troth / ne the swetnes of affeccyons to
god as it had first. Of this it comes most merciful lord that in my
inward man that is in the reason of my soul / I delight me in thy laws / and
in thy teachynges knowing that they are good / and ryghtwyse / and holy / and
that all sin is evil / and to be fled: and eschewed / and yet in my outward
man: that is is to say: in my fleshely feeling I serve the law of sin /
when I obey rather to sensualyte than to reason. And of this it folowethe also
/ that I will good / but to perform it without thy grace I may not for
weyknes of my self. And sometime I purpose to do many good deeds / but for
grace wants that should help me / I go backwarde and fail in my doing / I
know the way to perfeccyon / and how I should do I se it euyde^tly / but for
I am so oppressed with the heavy bourden of this corrupt body of syn I lie
still and rise not to perf^ccyon. O Lord how necessary therefore is thy grace
to me: to begin well / to contynewe well / and to end well: for without the
I may nothing do that good is. O heavenly grace: without whom our merytes
are naught worth / ne the gifts of nature no thing to be poudred / ne
crafts: or riches nothing to be regarded / nebeaute / strength / wit / ne
eloquence / nothing may avail / come thou shortly and help me. The gifts
of nature be commen to good men and to bad / but grace and love are the gifts
of the elect and chosen people / whereby they be marked and made able and
worthy to have the kingdom of heaven. This grace is of such worthynes that
neither the gift of proph^ye / ne thy workynge of miracles ne yet the gift of
co^nynge and knowledge may nothing avail without it / ne yet faith / hope / ne
other virtues be not acceptable to the without grace and charity. O blessed
grace that makes the poor in spirit / to be rich in virtue and him that is
rich in worldly goods makeste meke and low in heart / come and descend in
to my soul and fulfill me with thy ghostly confortes that it fail not ne
faint not for wermes / and drynes of it self. I beseech the lord that I may
find grace in thy sight / for thy grace shall suffyse to me / though I want
that nature desires / for although I be tempted and vexed with troubles on
every side / yet I shall not need to dread whiles thy grace is with me / for she
is my strength / she is my comfort / and she is my counsel and help she is
stronger than all mine enemies / and wyser: than all the wyseste of this world
/ she is the maystres of troth / the teacher i^ discipline / the light of the
heart the comfort of trouble / the dryuer away of heaviness / the auoyder of
dread / the nourisher of devotion / and the brynger in of sweet tears and
devout wepinges what am I than without grace / but as a dry stoke to cast
away. Grant me therefore that thy grace may prevent me and follow me and that
it may make me ever busy and dyligence in good warkes unto my death / so more
it be. Amen.

:That we ought to forsake our self / and for to follow Christ by berynge of
his Cross. The.lxi. Chapitre.
MI son as much as thou canste go out fro thy self and fro thine own will /
so much thou may enter in to me / and as to desire nothing outwardly
brings peace inwardely in to man's soul / so a man by an inward forsakyng
of him self joins him unto god. I will therefore that thou learn to have a
perfyte forsakynge / and a full resygnyng of thy self in to my hands without
withsaynge or co^playnyng / and that thou follow me for I am the way / I am the
troth / and I am the life: without a way no man may goo / and without
troth no man may know / and without life no man may live I am the way
which thou ought to go / the truth which thou ought to believe / and
the life which thou shalt hope to have / I am the way that can not be
defouled / the troth which can not be deceived / and the life that never
shall have end / I am the way most straight / the troth most perfyte / and
the life most sothfaste a blessed life / and a life unmade that made all
things / if thou dwell and abide in my way / thou shalt know the troth /
and troth shall deliver the / and thou shalt come to everlasting life / if
thou will come to that life keep my commandments / if thou will know the
truth believe my teachynges / if thou wylt be perfyte: sell all that thou have
/ if thou will be my dyscyple forsake thy self / if thou will have ^he
blessed life / despise this present life / if thou will be exalted in heaven
meke the here in earth / and if thou wylt reygne with me bear the cross with me
/ for truly only the servants of the cross shall find the life of
blessedfulnes and of everlasting light. O lord Jesus for as much as thy way
is narowe / and strayte / and is also much dyspised in the world / give me
grace to bear gladly the dispisinges of the world.: There is no servant
greater than his Lord / ne no dyscyple above his master / let thy servant
therefore be exercysed in thy ways for therein is the health / and the very
perfeccion of life / what so ever I read or here beside that way / it
refressheth me not ne delyteth me not fully. My sone for as much as thou
knoweste these things / and haste red them all / thou shalt be blessed if
thou fulfill them / he that has my commandments and keeps them / he it is
that loves me / and I shall love him / and I shall show my self unto him and
shall make him syt^e with me in ye kingdom of my father. Lord as thou haste
said and promised so be it done to me: I have taken the cross of penance of
thy hand: and I shall here it unto my death as thou haste put it to me to do.
For the life of every good man is the cross / and it is also the way and leder
to Paradyse / and now it is begone it is not lawefull for me to go abacke fro it
ne it is not behoueful for me to leave it: have done therefore my well-beloved
brethrene / go we forth to gether Jesus shall be with us for Jesus we have taken
this cross / for Jesus let us persevere and he shall be our help that is our
guide and leder. Lo our king goth before us that shall fight for us / follow we
him strongly dread we no perils / but be we ready to die strongly with him in
battle / that we put no blot in to our glory: ne mynyshe not our reward by
fleing cowardly away from the Cross.

:That a man shall not be overmuch cast into heaviness though he happen to fall
in to some defautes. The.lxii. Chapitre.
MI sone patience and mekenes in aduersite please me more / tha^ much
consolacyon and devotion in prosperity / why art thou so heavy for a little
word said or done against the / if it had been more thou should not have
been moved therewith / but let it now ouerpasse: it is not the first / and it
shall not be the last if thou live long. Thou art manfull enough as long as
no aduersyte falls to the and thou can well give counsel and well can
thou comfort and strengthen other with thy words. But when aduersite knocks
at thy door thou fayleste anon both of counsel and strength / behold well
therefore thy great fraylte which thou have daily experyence of in little
obiectes. Nevertheless it is for thy ghostly health that such things and other
like be suffered to come unto the / purpose thy self in thy heart to do the
best that lies in the / and than when such tribulacyo^s shall happen to fall
unto the / although i^ grieve y^ / yet let it not holly overthrow the ne let i^
not long ^a^y with the. And at the least suffer it pacyently / although thou
may not suffer it gladly. Moreover though thou be loath to here such things
and that thou feel great indignacyo^ ^herat in thy heart / yet thrust thy self
down low in thine own sight / and suffer no inordinate word pa^^e out of
thy mouth whereby any other might be hurted / and than all such indignacyon
shall be anon aswaged and soon appeased in the. And than also that wh^che
before was taken to so great heaviness to the / shall anon be made sweet and
pleasant in thy sight. For yet live I says our lord ready for to help the
and to comfort ye more tha^ ever I did before / if thou wylt holy trust in
me / and devoutly call for help to me. Be quiet in heart / prepayre thy self
yet to mo he sufferaunce. For it is not all lost though thou feel thy self
often troubeled or grievously tempted. Think thou art a man and not god / a
flesshely man: and no angel / how may thou always stand in one state of
virtue / when that wanted to angels in heaven: and to the first man in Paradyse
the which stood not long / I am he that reyse up them that be sorrowful to
health and conforte / and those that know their own unstableness: I lift them
up to be stabled in the sight of my godh^ed for ever.: Lord blessed be thy
holy word: It is more sweter to my mouth than honey comb. What should I do in all my troubles and heaviness / yet thou dyddeste not sometime conforte me with thy
wholesome and sweet words: therefore it shall not force what trouble or aduersyte
/ I suffer here for the so that I may in the end come to the port of
everlasting health. Give me a good end and a blessed passage out of this world
/ have mind on me my lord / my god / and dyrecte me by a straight and a ready
way in to thy kingdom: I beseech the. Amen.

:That a man shall not search the iugementes of God. The.lxiii. Chapitre.
MI sone beware to dyspute of high matters and of the secret iugementes of god
/ why this man is so left / and forsaken of God / and why this man is taken to
so great grace / why also one man is so much troubled: and an other so
greatly auaunced. These things ouerpasse all man's knowledge / ne to search
gods judgment / no man's reason may suffice ne yet his dysputacyon. Therefore
when the ghostly enemy styret the unto such things: or if any curyous men
ask of the such questyo^s: answer with the prophet Dauyd: and say thus.
Lord thou art ryghtwyse / and thy iugeme^tes are true and be justified in
them self / my iugeme^tes are to be dreded and not to be discussed by man's
wit / for they be to man's wit inconprehensyble / beware also that thou
search not / ne reason not of the merits of saints which of the^ was holyer
than other or which of the^ is higher in heaven. Such questions often times
norysshe great stryfes and unprofitable reasoninges and proceed of pride and
vainglory whereby envy spryngeth and discencyon / that is to say when one
labors to p^fer this saint and an other this. And truly a desire to know
such things rather dyspleseth saints than pleases them. For I (says our
lord) am not god of discencyon and strife: but of unity and peace / the which
peace stands rather in true mekenes than in exalting of them self. Some
men be more styred to love this saint or yt: and that with much greater
affection / but truly that affection is often times more rather a manly
affeccion tha^ a godly: am not I he that have made all saints (yes truly) and
over that I have given the^ grace / and I have given them glory. I know all
their merytes / I prevented them with the swetnes of my blessings. I knew my
elect and chosen people before the world was made /: I have chosen them from
the world: they have not chosen me / I called them by my grace / I drew them
by my mercy / I led them through temptacyons / I sent the^ inward co^fortes /
I gave them perseueraunce / I crowned their patience / I know the first man
and the last: I love the^ all with an vnestymable love. Thus I am to be praised
in all my saints / and above all things to be blessed and honored in all and
in every of them whom I have so gloriously magnyfied and predestinate without
any merytes in them going before. Therefore he that disprayseth the lest of my
saints / does no honor to the greatest / for I have made both the less and
the more / and he that dysprayseth any of my Saints / he dysprayseth me and
other of my saints in the kingdom of heaven / for they be all one / fast o^ed
and knyt to gether in one sure bo^de of perfect charity. They feel all one
thing and they will all one thing / and they love to gether all into one
thing / and they love me much more than them self / or their own merytes /
for they be rapte above them self and be drawn fro their own love / and
holy be turned in to my love in the which they rest by eternal fruycion.
There is nothing that may turn them from my love / ne that may thrust them
down out of their glory / for they be full of eternal troth / and brenne
inwardly in soul with fire of everlasting charity that never shall be quenched.
Let all them cesse therefore that be carnal and bestly and that can not love but
pryuate joy to search the state of my blessed saints in heaven / for they put
away and add to their merytes as they favor and not after the pleasure of
the eternal truth of god. In many folks is great ignorance but most
specially in them that have so little light of ghostely understanding: that
they can not love any person with a clean love. Many also be moved by a
natural affection or by a worldly frendeshype to love this saint or that / and
as they imagine i^ erthly things so they imagyn of heavenly things / but there
is a distance inco^perable betwyxte things which inperfite me^ imagyne by
natural reason / and which men truly illumyned with grace behold by heavenly
co^templacion. Beware therefore my sone to treat curyously of such things for
they pass thy knowledge / and endeavor thy self / that thou may be worthy
to be no^bred with the least saint that shall come to heaven. And if percase a
man might know who were holyer / or who should be taken greater in the
kingdom of heaven / what should that knowelege avail him / but if he would
thereby the more meke him self / and the more rise thereby into the laud and
praysynge of my name / truly nothing. Therefore he is much more acceptable to
god that thinks on the greatness of his sins / and of the lytelnes of his
virtues / and how far he is fro the perfeccion of the least saint that is
in heaven / than he that argues of their greatness or of their litelnes or
blessedness of life forgetting them self. It is better also with devout
prayers and with wepinges and tears mekely to pray to saints / and to call to
the^ for help / than vaynly to search for their perfeccion. They be very well
contented with the joy that they have if men would refrain them self fro
such vain arguments. They glorifye not them self of their merytes ne they a
scrybe no goodness to the^ self / but they refer all goodness to me / for they
know well that I of my infinite goodness and charity have given al unto the^.
And they be so much fulfilled with love of the Godhede and with our passinge
joy that no glory may want in them / ne no felicyte. And the higher yt they be
in heaven the meker they be in them self / and the more nyghe / and the more
loving unto me. Therefore it is written in the Apocalips / that saints in heaven
laid their crowns before god and fell prostrate on their faces before the
meke lamb that is Jesus and they worshypped him as their lord god / that is
and shall belyuynge evermore without ending. Amen. Many search who is highest
in heaven that know not whether they shall be worthy to be nombred with the least
/ that shall come thither / for it is a great thing to be the least in heaven
/ where all be great for all that shall come thither / shall be called the sons
of god / and so shall they be in deed / the least there shall be counted for a.M.
and a sinner of a.C. year shall be set at naught. When ye apostles asked among
them self who should be greatest in the kingdom of heaven. They herd this
answer of Christ. but ye said he be converted fro your sin: and be made
meke as little children / ye may not enter in to the kingdom of heaven. He
therefore that makes him self as this little child / he shall be greatest in the
kingdom of heaven Woe than be to them yt dysdayne to meke them self with
little Children: for the meke yate of heaven will not suffer them to enter in to
it / woe also be unto the rich proud men that have their consolacyon here. For
when the good poor men shall enter into the kingdom of god / they shall stand
weeping and waylynge without. joy / ye than ye that be meke and poor in
spirit / for youres is the kingdom of god / so that ye walk and hold your
journey assuredly in the way of truth.

:That all our hope and trust is to be put in God only. The.lxiii. Chapitre.
O Lord? what is the trust that I have in this life / or what is my most
solace of all things under heaven. Is it not thou my lord God whose mercy is
without mesure / where has it been well with me without the / or when has
it not been well with me thou being present / I had lever be poor with ehe
than rich without the / I had leauer be with the as a pilgrim in this world
/ than without the to be in heaven / for where thou art there is heaven / and
where thou art not / there is both death and hell. Thou art to me all that I
desire / and therefore it behooves me to fighe to the / to cry for the / and
hertely to pray to the / I have nothing to trust in that may help me in my
necessytes but only the / for thou art my hope / thou art my trust / thou
art my conforte / and thou art my most faithful helper in every need / man
seeks that is his / but thou sekeste my health and profit / and tourneste all
thing into the best for me / for if thou send temptacions and other
aduersytes thou ordeynest all to my profit / for thou art wont by a
thousand ways to prove thy chosen people. In which proof thou art no less
to be lauded and praised / tha^ if thou had fulfilled the^ with heavenly
confortes. In the lord therefore I put my trust: and in the I bear pacie^tly
all my aduersites / for I find nothing without the but unstableness and folly /
for I se well that the multitude of worldely friends profits not / ne that
strong helpers nothing may avail / ne wise cou^sayler give profitable
counsel: ne conning of doctors give co^solacion / ne riches deliver in time
of need ne secreee place any thing defend / if thou lord do not assyste /
helhe / conforte / counsel / inform / and defend / for all things that
seem to be ordained to man's solace i^ this world if thou be absent / be
right naught worth ne may not bring to man any true felycyte / thou art the
end Lord of all good things / the hyghnes of life and the profounde wisdom
of all thing that is in heaven and in earth / wherefore to trust in the above
all things / is the gretest conforte to all thy servants. To the therefore I
lift mine eyes / and in the only I put my trust / my lord my god the father
of mercy / bless thou / and halowe thou my soul with thy heavenly blessings /
that it may be thy dwelling place / and the sete of thy eternal glory / so
that nothing be found in me at any time that may offend the eye of the
majesty / behold me lord after the greatness of thy goodness / and of thy
manyfolde mercyes and graciously here the prayer of me thy poorest servant /
outlawed and far exiled into the country of shadow of death / defend: and
keep me among the manyfolde perilles: and dangers of this corruptyble life /
and dyrecte me through thy grace by the way of peace into the country of
everlasting clerenes without ending. Amen.

FINIS
Here after follows the fourth book of the following of Christ which
treats most specially of the sacrament of the altar.
Prologus.
COme to me (says our lord) al ye that labor and be charged / and I shall
give unto you refeccyon And the bread that I shall give unto you shall be my
flesh / for the life of the world. Take it and eat it / for it is my body
that for you shall be given in sacryfice / do ye this in remembrance of me for
who eats my flesh: and drynketh my blood / he shall dwell in me and I in
him / these words that I have said you be spyryte and life.

:With how great reverence Christ is to be received. The first Chapter.
O My lord Jesus Christ eternal troth: these words aforesaid be thy words
/ all be it they were not said in one self time / nor written in one self
place.: And for that they be thy words / I will thankefully and faithfully
accept the^ they be thy words / and thou haste spoken them / and they be now
mine also / for thou have said them for my health / I will gladly receive the^
of thy mouth to the end they may be the better sown: and planted in my
heart / thy words of so great pity full of swetnes / and love greatly e^cyte
me. But lord my sins fere me greatly / and my conscyen^e not pure for to
receive so great a mysterye / draws me sore abacke. The swetnes of thy
words provoke me / but the multitude of mine offenses charge me very sore.
Thou co^mau^dest that I shall come unto the faithfully if I will have part
with the and receive the noryshyng of immortalyte. And coueyte to obtain the
glory and life eternal. Thou say lord / come ye unto me that labor: and
be charged and I shall refresshe you. O how sweet and how amyable a word is
it in the ear of a sinner that thou lord god will bid me that am so poor and
nedy to the communion of thy most holy body. But what am I lord that I dare
presume to come to the. Lo heaven and earth may not comprehend the / and thou
sayeste come ye al to me / what meneth this most meke worthynes / and this
lovely and frendely byddyng / how shall I dare come to the which know not
that I have done any thing well / how shall I bring the into mine house
which so often have offended before thy face. Angels and archangels honor the
/ and ryghtwyse men dread the / and thou say yet come ye all unto me / but
yt thou lord had said it / who would believe it to be true. But thou have
commanded it / who durst atte^pte to go to it. Noe that just man labored an
ho^dred year to make the shype to ye end he might be saved with a few of his
people / how may I prepare me than i^ an hour to receive the with due
reverence that art maker and creatoure of all the world. Moses the servant
and great familier and special friend made the arc of timber not corruptible
which he covered with right purer gold and put in it the tables of the law /
and I a corrupt creature / how shall I so lyghtely dare receive the that art
maker of the law and gyuer of grace and life unto all creatures. The wise
Salamon king of Israel edified a marvelous temple to the praysyng of thy name
i^ the space of.vii. years and by.viii. days hallowed the feste of the
dedicacion of the same / he offered a thousa^de peasible hosts and put the ark of god i^ the place made ready for it with great melody of clario^s and
tru^pettes. How dare I tha^ that am most poor among other creatures receive
the i^ to my house / which scarsely have well spent one hour of time or one
half hour of my life. O my lord how much studyeth they to please the / and
how little is it that I do / how little time take I when I dispose me to be
houseled seldom am I gathered to gether in the / and more seldom am I pourged
fro having my mind overmuch on worldly things and certainly no unprofitable
thoughts ought to come into thy holy p^sence of thy godhede nor no creatures
ought there to have place / for I shall not receive an Angel / but the lord
of Angels in to mine heart / Nevertheless there is a great difference between
the ark of God with his relykes and thy most pure and precious body with his
virtues / which are more than can be spoken / and between the sacryfyce of the
old law / that was but a figure of the new law / and the true host of thy
precious body that is the acco^plyssheme^t of all the old sacrifyce / why than
am I not more enflamed to come to the / why do I not prepayre my self with
greater dilygence to receive this holy and blessed sacrament sith the holy
au^cyent fathers the patriarchs and prophets / kings and princes with all the
people have showed so great affeccion toward thy service in time passed The
most devout and blessed king the king David went before the ark of god and
honored it with all his strength always remembrynge the great benefytes before
given to the fathers / he made orga^s of diverse manners and also Phalmes which
be ordained to be song / and he him self song the^ with great gladness / and
often times with his herpe he being fulfilled with the grace of the holy ghost
taught the people of Israel to laud and praise god with all their heart / and
daily with their mouth to bless him and preche his goodness. And if there were
showed tha^ so great denocio^ and remembrance of laud and praising to god
before the arc of the old testamente / how much reverence and devotion
ought we tha^ now to have i^ the p^sence of his holy sacrament and in the
receyuyng of the most excellent body of our lord Jesus Christ many re^ne to
diverse places to visit relykes of saints and marvel greatly wha^ they here
of their blessed deeds. They se great buyldinges of temples / and behold how
their bones and holy relyq^s be covered with sylk and lapped in gold. And lo
thou my lord god thou art present here with me in ye altar: the most holy
saint of saints maker of all things and lord of Angels. Often times there is
great curiosite and vanite in the sight of all such things and litel fruit
and ame^deme^t is had thereby and that specially where there is so light recouse
/ and wauerynge without any contricyon goyne before. But thou my lord god my
lord Jesus Christ god and man art here hole present in the sacrament of the
altar / where the fruit of everlasting health is had plentuously as often as
thou art worthily and devoutly received. But if that shall be done fruytefully
/ there may be no lyghtnes / curyously / nor sensualyte / but steadfast faith
devout hope and pure charity. O god i^uisible maker of all the world how
meruaylously doste thou with us / how swetely and how gracyously dysp^sest
thou all things to thy chosen people / so whom thou offerest thy self to be
taken in this glorious sacrament. Certainly it surmou^teth all understanding
and it draws the hertes and kyndeleth the affeccion of all devout me^. The
true faithful people that dispose al their life to amendment* receive often
times through this glorious sacrament great grace and devotion and great love
of virtue. O meruaylous and secretly hid is the grace of this sacrament the
which the faithful people of Christ do only know / for infidels and they
that live in sin may have there of no manner of experience. In this sacrament
spiritual grace is given / and the virtue that was lost in their soul is
repaired / and the beauty that was defourmed through syne retourneth again /
and the grace of this sacrament sometime is so much that of the fulness ^f
devotion that comes thereby / not only the mind but also the feable bodies
recover their former strength.: But verey it is greatly to be sorowed that we
be so slow and neclyge^t / and that we be styrred with no more affection to
receive Christ than we be / for in him stands all merit and hope of them
that shall be saved / he is our health and our redemption / he is the confortour
of all that live in this world / and the eternal rest of saints in heaven.
And it is al so streately to be sorowed / that so many take so little head of
this high mystery which gladeth the heaven and preserves all the world. Alas
the blydnes and hardness of man's heart that takes no greatter head to so
noble a gift / but by the daily vsi^g thereof is neclyge^t and takes little
head thereto / if this blessed sacrament were mynistred only i^ one place and
consecrate by one preeste in the world / with how great desire think thou
the people would run to that place and to yt p^est that they might se there
these heavenly mysteryes. Now there be many p^estes and crist is offered i^ many
places that the grace: and love of god to man may appear so much the more as
the holy co^munyon is spread the more abroad throughout the world / thanki^ges
be to ye therefore my lord Jesus that thou vouch saufe to refreshe us poor
outlawes with thy p^cious blood and to stire us with ye words of thyn own
mouth to receive this holy mystery / saying come ye all to me yt labor and be
charged and I shall refresshe you.

That the great goodness and charity of god is given to man in this blessed
sacrament. The.ii. Chapyter.
O My lord Jesus trustyng i^ thy great goodness and mer^ye I come to the as a
syke man to him that shall heal him: and as he that is hongry and thursty to
the fou^tayne of life / that is nedy to the king of heaven as a servant to his
lord a creature to his creature / and as a desolate person to his meke and
blessed confortour. But how is it that thou comeste to me / who am I that thou
wylt give thy self unto me / how dare I a sinner appear before the / and how
is it that thou wylt vouchesaufe to come to so simple a creature / thou know
thy servant and see well that he has no godnes of hi^ self whereby thou
should give this grace unto him / I confess therefore mine own unworthiness
and I knowledge thy goodness / I praise thy pite and yield the thankinges for
thy great charity. Verily thou do all this for thine own godnes / and not
for my merits that thy goodness may thereby the more appear / and thy charity
the more largely showed / and thy meekness the more hyghly be commended.
Therefore because this pleases the / and thou have commanded that it should
thus be done: thy goodness: also therein pleases me / and would to god that mine
iniquyte resisted it not. O my lord Jesus how great reverence and thankynges
with perpetual praysynges of thy name ought to be given the for the receyuyng
of thy holy body / whose dygnyte no man is able to express. But what shall I
think in this communion / and in going to my Lord god / whom I can not
worship as I ought to do / and yet I desire to receive him devoutly. But what
may I think better or more helthfull to me than holy to meke my self before
the / exaltyng thy infinite goodness far above me. I laud the my lord god
and shall exalte the euerlastyngly. I despise my self / and submytte me to the
and sorrow greatly the depenes of mine iniquyte. Thou art the saint all
saints and I am the fylth of all sinners / and yet thou inclyneste thy self
to me: that am not worthy to look toward the. Thou come to me / thou wylt
be with me. Thou biddest me to thy feast / thou will give me this heavenly
meat and this Angels fode to eat which is plainly none other but thy self /
that ar^e the lively bread which discendeste fro heaven and gyuest life to the
world / behold lord fro whe^s all this love proceeds and how great goodness
shyneth upon us and how great thanks and praises are due to the therefore. O
how helthfull and how profitable a counsel was it when thou or daynest this
glorious sacrament / and how sweet / and how ioyus a feast was it wha^ thou
gave thy self as meat to be eaten. O lord how meruaylous is thy work /
how mighty is thy virtue / and how far unspeakable is thy troth. By thy
word all things were made and al things were done as thou have commanded /
it is meruaylous thing and worthy to be believed and far above the
understanding of man that thou lord that art god and v^ ^a^ art holy contained
under a little lykenes of bread and wine and art eaten with out consumynge of
him that take^h the / and that thou that art lord of all things and that
nedest nothing in this world would by this glorious sacrament dwell in us /
keep thou mine heart and my body immaculate that in a glad and a pure
conscience. I may often times celebrate thy misteres and receive the^ to my
everlasting health which thou haste ordained most specially to thy honor and
perpetual memory O my soul be thou merry and glad for so noble a gift and so
synguler a comfort left to the in this vale of myserye / for as often as thou
remembrest this mystery / and take the body of Christ: so often thou workest
the work of thy redempcyon / and art made part taker of all the merytes of
Christ Truly the charity of Christ is never minished / and the greatness of
his mercy is never consumed* and therefore thou ought always with a new
renewinge of mind to dispose the to it / and with a well aduysed and a deep
co^sideracion to think on this great mystery of health / it should seem to ye
as new and as pleasant a joy and comfort wha^ thou singest mass or herest it
/ as if christ the same day first entered into the womb of the vyrgyne and were
made man / or if he the same day suffered and dyed upon the cross for the
health of mankind.

:That it is very profitable often to be houseled^ The third Chapyter.
O Lord I come to the: to the end that it may be well with me through thy
gift / and that I may joy at the holy feast that thou of thy great goodness
have made ready for me In the is all that I may or shall desire / for thou art
my health and my redempcyon / my hope / my strength / my honor and glory.
Make me thy servant this day merry and glad in the / for I have lift my soul
unto the / now I desire devoutly / and reverently to receive the in to mine
house that I may dese^e with zachee to be blessed of the / and to be
accompanied among the children of Abraham / my soul coueyteth to receive thy
body / my heart desires to be oned with the / betake thy self to me lord /
and it suffyseth / for without the there is no comfort / ne without the I may
not be / ne without thy vysitacyon I may not live / and therefore it behooves me
often times to go to the and for my health to receive the / lest happily if I
should be defrauded from that heavenly meat I should fail in the way. So thou
saydest thy self most mercyful Jesus as thou were preaching unto the people and
heleddest them of their sykenes / I will not let the^ return into their
houses fasting lest they fail by the way / do with me therefore in like
manner / that haste left thy self in this glorious sacrament for the conforte
of al faithful people. Thou art forsake the true refeccyon of the soul / and
he that worthily eats the shall be part taker: and heir of eternal glory /
it is necessary unto me that so often do offend / so sone ware dull and slow /
that by often prayours and confessyons I may renew my self / purefye my self
/ and kyndle my self to quyckes / and favor of spirit / lest happily by long
obteynynge I might all fro that holy purpose for the wits of man and woman be
fro their youth proud and ready to evil / and but this heavenly medecyne do
help / man may anon fall to worse and worse: therefore this holy co^munyon
draws a man fro evil and comforts him in goodness if I now be often times
so neclygent and slouthful wha^ I am co^monde what should I be if I received not
that blessed medycine nor sought not for that great help / and though I be
not every day apt nor disposed to receive my creatoure / nevertheless I shall
take heed to receive him in times conuenyrnt / so that I may be part taker of
so great a grace / for it is one of the most pryncypall co^solacions to a
faithful soul: that is to say / that as long as he is as a pilgrim in this
mortal body / that he often remember his lord God and receive him that is his
only beloved above all things. It is a meruaylous goodness of the great pytye
that thou lord have auenste us / that thou creator and gyuer of life to all
spirits vouchest safe to come to a pore creature / and with thy godhede and
manhood to refreshe his hungre and need. O happy is that man and blessed is
that soul that deserves devoutly to receive his lord god / and in that
receyuynge to be fulfilled with a spirytuall joy. O how great lord does he
receive / how well beloved a geste does he bring into his house / how joyous
a fellow does he receive / how faithful a friend does he accept / how noble
a spouse does he enbrace / that receives the / for thou art only to be
beloved before all other / and above all things / let heaven and earth and all
the ornaments of them be still in thy presence / for what so ever they have
worthy laud or praise / they have it of the larges of thy gift / and yet they
may not be like to the honor and glory of thy name / of whose wisdom there
is no nombre nor measure.

That many commodytes be given unto them that devoutly receive this holy
sacrament. The.iiii. Chapter.
O My lord God / preuente thy servant with the blessings of thy swetnes
that he may deserve for to go reverently and devoutly to this high sacrament
/ stir up mine heart in to a full beholdi^g of the / and deliver me fro the
great sloth and ydelnes yt I have be^ i^ time passed visit me in thy goodness
and give me grace to taste inwardely in my soul / the swetnes that is hyd
secretly in this blessed sacrament as in a most plentuous fountain.
Illumyne also mine eyes to se and behold so great a mystery and stre^gthe^ me
that I may always faithfully and undoubtedly believe it / for it is thy
operacyon and not the power of man / thy holy institucyon and not man's
inuencyon. And therefore to take and to understand these things no man is
sufficyent of him self and they also ouerpasse the subtylte of all angels and
heavenly spirits / what may I than most unworthy sinner earth and ashes
search and take of so high a secret but only that in symplenes of heart / in
a good stable faith and by thy commandment / I come to the with meke hope
and reverence and believe verily that thou art here present in this sacrament
god and man. Thou will therefore that I shall receive the / and knitte my self
unto the inperfyte charity / wherefore I ask the mercy: and desire that thou
give me thy special grace that I may fro hense forth be fully molten: and
relented in to the and flow in thy love / and never after to intermytte my
self with any other comfort. This most high and most worthy sacrament is the
life of the soul and body* The medecyne of al spiritual sykenes whereby all
vices be cured / passions be refrayned / temptacyo^s be overcome and
demynysshed: the greatier grace is sen^e virtue is increased / faith is
stablysshed / hope is strengthed / and charity is kyndeled and spread abroad.
Thou have given and yet often times gyueste many great gifts by this
sacrament to thy beloved servants that devoutly receive the: for thou
thereby art the strong vpholder of my soul / the repayrer of all the
infyrmyties of man / and the gyuer of all inward consolacion / and of comfort
in tribulacion and fro the depenes of their own de^ection thou lay^est the^
again into a strong hope of thy preseruacyon / and reneweste them and lyghtest
them inwardely with a new grace / so that they that felt the^ self before
receyuynge of that blessed sacrament heavy and without affec^ion after when they
have received it / have found them self changed into great ghostely feruoure
/ and all this thou doste unto thy elect people of thy great goodness that they
may se and know openly by experience that they have nothing of the^ self but
that all grace and goodness that they have / they have received of the: for they
of them self be cold / dull / and undevout and by the they be made feruente
quycke in spirit and devout folowers of thy will / who may go mekely to the
fountain of swetenes but that he shall bring away with him great plentye of
swetnesse / or who may stand by a great fire / but he shall feel great hete
thereof / and thou lord art the fountain of all swetnesse / and the fire
always brennynge / and never faylynge / and therefore though I may not draw
of thy fulness of that fou^tayne ne drink thereof to the full. I shall never the
less put my mouth to the hole of the heavenly pype that I may take some litel
drop thereof to refresshe my thirst so that I be not all dried away / and
though I be not all heavenly and all brennyng in charity as the Seraphyns and
Cherubyns be / nevertheless I shall endeuer me to set my self to devotion / and
to prepayre mine heart that I may get some little sparkle of the brennynge of
heavenly live though the meke receyui^g of this lively sacrament / and what so
ever wants in me I beseech the my lord Jesus most holy and blessed that thou
benyngly and gracyously supply in me: for thou haste vouchedsafe to call all to
thy saying. Come ye to me all that labor and be charged and I shall
refresshe you.: I labor in the sweet of my body: and am turmented with the
sorrow of my heart / I am charged with sins / trauayled with temptacyons
intriked and oppressed with many evil passions / and there is none that may
help or that may delyurr me / ne that may make me saufe / but thou lord God
my only sauyoure / to whom I committee me and all mine that thou keep me / and
led me into life everlasting / accept me and take me into the laud and
glory of thy name that haste ordained to me thy body and blood into my meat
and drink / and grant me lord I beseech the that by the often receyuynge of
thy high mystery the feruoure of devotion may daily increase in me.

:Of the worthynes of the sacrament of the altar / and of the state of
preesthode. The.v. Chapter.
IF thou had ye purete of Angels and the holiness of saint John^ Baptist:
thou should not for yt be worthy to receive ne touch this holy sacrament /
for it is not granted for the merytes of man that a man should consecrate and
touch the sacrament of Christ and take to his meat the bread of angels / it
is a great misterye and it is a great dignyte of priests to whom it is
granted that is not granted to angels / for prestes only that ^e duly
ordained in the church have power to sing mass / and to cansecrate the body
of Christ / for a preeste is the minyster of god: using the word of
consecracion by the commandment and ordinance of god / and god is there the
pryncypall doer: and the inuisyble worker / to whom is subject all that he
wylleth / and all obeys to that he commands. Thou ought therefore more
to believe almighty god in this most excellent sacrament / tha^ thine own
wit or any other vysible token or sign. And therefore with dread and
reverence it is to go to this blessed work. Take heed than diligently and se
fro whens this mystery and service comes that is given unto the by the
touching of the hands of the bysshope. Thou art now made a preeste and art
consecrate to sing mass. Take heed therefore that thou faithfully and
deuoutely offer thy sacryfyce to god in due time / and that thou keep thy self
without reprofe / thou have not made thy bourden more light* but thou art now
bound in a strayter bond of dyscyplyne and of much more high perfeccion
than thou were before A preeste ought to be adourned with all virtues: and to
give other example of good life / his conuersacyon should not be with the
common people / ne in the common way of the world / but with Angels in heaven or
with perfyte men in earth that ^e most best disposed to serve god. A preeste
also clothed in holy vestementes bears the place of Christ that he should
humbly and mekely pray to our lord for him self: and for all the people he
has before him and behind him the sign of the cross of Christ / that he
dylygently should remember his passion / he bears before him the cross that
he may dilygently behold: and se ye steps of Christ and study fervently to
follow them / and behind him also he is sygned with the cross that he should
gladly and mekely suffer all aduersityes for the love of god / he bears the
cross before him / that he should bewail his own sins and he bearethe it
behind him that he may through co^passyon bewepe the sins of other / and
know him self to be set as a mean between God and all the people / and not
to cease of prayer and holy oblacyo^ till he may deserve of almighty god mercy
and grace / when a preeste says mass / he honors God / he makes angels
glad / he edifieth the church he helps the people that be on live / and
gives rest to them that be deed / and makes him self part taker of all
good deeds.

:Of the inward remembrance and exercise that a man ought to have before the
receiving of the body of Christ The.vi. Chapitre.
Lord when I think of thy worthynes: and of my great fylthynes I tremble
strongly and am confounded in my self / for if I receive the not I fle the
eternal life / and if I unworthily receive the. I re^ne into thy wrath what
shall I than do my good lord / my helper / my protectoure / conforter / and
right sure counsayloure in all my necessites. Teach me good lord the right
way / and purpose unto me some ready exc^rcyse couenable unto the receyuynge of
this holy mystery / for it is necessary unto me / and greatly profitable to
know how devoutly and reverently I ought to prepayre mine heart to receive
it / or to consecrate so great and so goodely a sacrifise as it is.

:Of the dyscussynge of our own conscience / and of the purpose of amendment.
The.v.iii. Chapter.
IT behooves the above all things with soueraygne reverence and profounde
mekenes of heart and with full faith and humble intent^ to the honor of God
to celebrate: take and receive this holy sacrament / examyne dilygentely thy
conscience by true contrycyon and meke confession and make it clean after thy
power: so that thou know nothing that greueth: or byteth thy conscience or
that may let the to go freely unto it / have dyspleasure of all thy sins in
general / and for thy daily excesses and offenses have syghynges / and
sorowynges more special / and if the time will suffer it / confess unto god
in secret of thine heart the miseryes of all thy passions / weep and sorrow
that thou art yet so carnal and worldely / so on mortyfied fro thy passions /
so full of mocyons of concupiscences so unware and so evil ordered in thy
outward wits / so often intryked with vain fantasies / so much enclyned to
outward and to worldly things so neglygent to inward things / so ready to
laughing and dyssolucyon / so hard to weeping and co^punccion / so ready to
easy things / and to that / that is lykyng to the flesh / so slow to
penance and feruoure of spirit / so curious to here new things and to se
fair things / so loath to meke and abiecte things / so covetous to have much
/ so scarce to give / so glad to hold / so unadvised in speking so incontinent
to be still so evil ordered in manners / so importune in deeds / so gredy upon
meat / so defe to the word of god so quycke to rest / so slow to labor /
so atte^tyue to fables / so slepy to holy vigels hasty to the end / so
unstable to take heed unto the way to the end / so neclygente in the service
of god so duly and so undevout to go to mass / so dry in thy howsen / so
sone fallen at large to outward things so seldom gathered to gether to
inward things / so sone moved to anger and wrath / so lyghtely styred to the
dyspleasure of other / so ready to judge / so rygorous to reprove / so glad in
prosperyte / so feeble in aduersyte / so o^te purposynge many good things: and
so syldome bringing them to effect. And wha^ thou haste thus confessed and
bewepte all these defautes and such other like in the / with great sorrow and
displeasure of thine own fraylnes / set the than in a full purpose to amend
thy life / and to profit always fro better to better / and than with a full
resygngne / and a hole will offer thy self in to the honor of my name in the
altar of thy heart as sacrafyce to me: that is to say faithful co^mytti^g to
me both thy body and soul / so that thou may be worthy to offer to me this
high sacryfice and to receive helthfully the sacrament of my holy body / for
there is no oblacyon more worthy nor satisfaccyon greater to put away sin /
than a man to offer him self purely and holy to god with the offering of the
body of Christ in mass and in holy co^munyon. If a man do that in him is and
is truly penytente as often as he comes to me for grace and forgyuenes. I am
the lord that says / I will not the death of a sinner but rather that he be
converted and live / and I shall no more remember his sins / but they all
shall be forgyuen and pardoned unto him.

:Of the oblacyon of Christ in the cross / and a full forsakynge of our self.
The.viii. Chapter.
Our Lord Jesus says unto his servant thus.:: As I hanginge all naked with
mine arms spredde upon the Cross / offered my self unto God the for thy
sins / so that nothing remained in me / but that all went in sacrifyce /
for to please my Father: and to appease his wrath auenste mankind / so thou
oughteste forto offer thy self freely to God / as much as thou may in a
pure and holy oblacyon daily in ye mass with all thy power and affection. What
require I more of the than that thou should study holy to resygne thy self
unto me / for what so ever thou gyuest beside thy self I regard it not / for
I look not for thy gifts: but for the / for as it should not suffyce to the to
have all things besides me: so it may not please me what so ever thou give but
thou give thy self. Offer thy self to me and give thy self all for god / and
thy oblacyon shall be acceptable.: Lo I offered my self holy to my father for
the / and I gave my body and blood to thy meat that I should be all holy thine
/ and thou mine / but if thou have a trust in thy self and do not freely
offer the to my will: thy oblacion is not pleasant / and there shall be
between us no perfyte onynge. Therefore a fre offering of thy self into the
hands of god must go before all thy works if thou will obtain grace / and
the true lybertye. Therefore it is that so few be inwardly ylluminate and fre
because they can not holy forsake the^ self (for my words be true) but a man
renounce him self he may not be my disciple / and therefore if thou coueyte to
be my dysciple offer thy self fully to me with all thing affection and love.
Amen.

That we ought to offer our self and all ours to god: and to pray for all
people. The.ix. Chapyter.
Lord all things be thine that be in heaven and earth. I desire to offer my
self to the in a free and perpetual oblacyon / so that I may perpetually be
with the. Lord in simpleness of heart I offer me this day to the to be thy
seruau^te in thy service and sacrifice of laud perpetual / accept me with
this oblacion of thy precious body which I this day offer to the in presence
of thy holy Angels that be here present inuysyble that it may be to my health
and to the health of all the people / and lord I offer to the all my sins and
offenses that I have committed before the and thy holy Angels fro the day that
I might first offend unto this day / that thou vouchesaufe through thy
great charity to put away al my sins and to cleanse my conscience of all mine
offenses and restore to me again the grace that I through sin have lost and
that thou forgive me all things paste and receive me mercyfully in to a
blessed kyssyng of peace and of forgyuenes / what may I do than but mekely
confess and bewail my sins / and continually ask mercy of the / forgive me
merciful lord now I beseech the for all my sins displease me much / and I
will never committee them again but sorrow for them ready to do penance and
satisfaccyon after my power / forgive me lord forgive me my sins and for thy
holy name / save my soul yt thou haste redeemed with thy precious blood / I
committee my self holy unto thy mercy / I resygne me in to thy hands do with
me after thy goodness / and not after my malice and wretchedness. I offer
also unto the all my good deeds / though they be very few and imparfyte that
thou amend them and sanctifye them and make them liking: and acceptable to
the / and always make them better and better / and that thou bring me though^ I
be a slow and an unprofitable person to a blessed and laudable end. I offer
also to the all the desires of devout persons / the necessyte of mine
auncesters / friends / brother / sister / and of all my lovers / and of all
them that for thy love have done good to me or to any other / and that have
desired and asked me to pray or to do sacryfyce for them or for their friends
whether they be on live or deed / that they may the rather feel thy help of
thy grace and the gift of thy heavenly consolacyon thy proteccyon fro all peryls
/ and the delyueraunce fro all pain / and that they so being delivered fro
all euyls may in spyrytuall gladness yield to the high laud and praysynges.
I offer to the also my prayer and my peasyble offering for all them that have
in any thing hyndered me or made me heuye / or that have done me any hurt or
grieve / and for all them also whom I have at any time made heavy / troubled /
grieved / or sclaundered in words or deed wittyngly or ignorau^tly: that thou
forgive us all together our sins and offenses against the / and of each of us
against other / and that thou lord take fro our hertes al suspicion and
indignacyon / wrath / varyaunce / and what so ever may let charity or
dimynisshe ye fraternal love that each of us should have to other / haue^ mercy
lord have mercy on all them that ask the mercy / and give grace to the^ that
have need and make us to stand in such case that we be worthy to have thy
grace / and finally to come to the life everlasting. Amen.

:That the holy communyon is not lyghtely to be forborne. The.x. Chapter.
IT behooves the to run often to the fountain of grace and mercy / and to
the fountain of all goodness and puryte: that thou may be heled fro the
passions and vices / and be made more strongt against all the temptacyons and
deceytfull crafts of the enemy. The five knowing / the greateste fruit and
hygheste remedy to be in receyuynge of this blessed sacrament enforseth him by
all the ways that he can to let and withdraw all faithful and devout people
fro it as much as he can / and therefore some men wha^ they dispose tha^ self
to it have more greater temptacions than they had before / for as it is written
in Job the wicked spirit comes among the children of god: that he may by
his old malice and wyckednes trouble the^ or make the^ over much fearful
and perplexed / so that he may dymynysshe their affection / or take away their
faith / if happily he may thereby make them either utterly to cease fro being
howseled or else that they go to it with little deuocyo^ / but it is not any
thing to care for all his crafts and fantasyes how vile and ugly so ever they
be / but al fantasies are to be thrown again at his own head / and he so
far to be despised that for all his assau^es and co^mocyons that he can styre
up / the holy communyon be not omytted / sometime over much curiousness to
have devotion / or over great doubt of making confession / lets much this
holy purpose / do therefore after the counsel of wise men / and put away all
doutfulnes and scripulousnes for they let the grace of god and dystroye holly
the devotion of thy mind. Also it is not good that for any little trouble or
grefe that thou leave this holy work but go lightly and be confessed / and
forgive gladly all that have offended the. And if thou have offended any other
mekely ask of them forgyuenesse / and god shall right mercyfully forgive the /
what profyteth it long to tarry fro co^fessyon or to dyffer this holy
communyon. Pourge the first and quyckely cast out thy venyme and have the after
to take thy medecyne: and thou shall feel more profit thereby tha^ if thou
taryeddest longer fro it / if thou differ it to day fro this thing or that /
to morrow may happen to come a greatter / and so thou may be let long fro
thy good purpose / and be made afterward more unapt unto it. Therefore as soon as thou canste discharge thy self fro such heaviness and dulnes of mind / and
fro all slouch / for it nothing profyteth long to be anguysshed: long to go
with trouble / and to sequester him self: for such daily obstacles fro yt
deuyne mysteryes / but it does great hurt: and commonly brings in great
sloth and lack of devotion. But alas for sorrow some slothful and dissolute
persons gladely seek causes to tarry fro confession / and so dyfferre the
longer this holy co^munyon and that they do to the entente that they should not
be bound to give them self to a more sure keeping of the^ self in time to
come tha^ they have done before. But alas how little charity and slender
devotion have they that so lightly leave of so holy a thing / and how happy
is he and how acceptable to God that so lives and that keeps his conscience
in such a clennes that he is every day ready and has good affection to be
howsled if it were laufull unto him / and that he might do it without note or
slander / He that sometime absteyneth of mekenes or for any other laufull
impedyment is to be praised for his reverence / but if it be through
slothfulness: he ougt to quycken him self and to do that in him is and our
lord shall strengthen his desire for his good will / for to a good will our
lord has always a special respect / and wha^ he is lawfully let / he
shall have a good will and meke intent to it / and so he shall not want the
fruit of the sacrament. And verily every devout man may every day and every
hour go helthfully and without prohibicion unto the spiritual communion of
Christ / that is to say in reme^brynge of his passion / and nevertheless in
certain days and times he is bound to receive sacramentally the body of his
redemoure with a great reverence: and rather to pretend therein the laud and
honor of god than his own consolacion. For so often a man is houseled
mystically and inuysibly as he remembers devoutly the mystery of the
incarnacion of Christ and his passion and is thereby kyndled into his love / he
that does not prepaire him self for none other cause but because the feast is
coming or the custom co^pelleth him thereto / he shall commonly be unready to
it / blessed is he therefore that as often as he says mass or is houseled
offers him self unto our Lord in holy sacrafice / be not in saying mass
over long nor over short / but keep the good common way as they do that thou
lyueste with / for thou ought not to do that should grieve other or make the^
tedyous but to keep the common way after the ordinance of the holy fathers /
and rather to confyrme thy self to that that shall be profitable to other / than
to follow thine own devotion or pryuate pleasure.

:That the body of Christ / and holy scripture are most necesary for the help
of man's soul. The.xi. Chapter.
O Most sweteste Jesus / how great swetnesse is it unto a devout soul
when he is fed with the at thine heavenly feast / where there is none other
meat brought forth to eat but thou his only beloved: and that ar^e most
desyrable to him above all the desires of his heart / and verily it should be
sweet and pleasau^te to me / by an inward and meke affection to weep before
the / and with the blessed woman (Mary Magdaleyne) to wasshe thy fete with the
tears of mine eyes. But where is that devotion / where is that plentuous
shedynge out of holy tears. Certainly all my heart ought to brenne and to
weep for joy in the sight of the and of thy holy Angels / for I have the
verily present with me / though thou be hyd under an other lykenes / for to
behold the in thy proper and divine clerenes mine eyes might not bear it / nor
all the world might not sustain to se the in ye clerenes and glory of thy
magesty Therefore thou greatly help my waykenesse in that thou hydeste thy
self under this holy sacrament. I have him verily and worshype him whom
angels worsshype in heaven / but I only in faith and they in open sight and in
thine own lykenes without any conuerture / it behooves me to be content in
the light of true faith and therein to walk till the day of everlasting
clerenesse shall appear / and that the shadow of fygures shall go away when
that that is parfyte shall come all use of sacraments shall cease / for they
that be blessed in the heavenly glory have no need of this sacramental
medicine: for they joy without end in the presence of god / beholdynge his
glory / face to face / and so trans^ormed fro clerenesse to clerenesse of the
godhede they taste ye glory of the sone of God made man as he was in his
godhede fro the beginning and shall be everlasting / when I remember al these
meruaylous confortes what solace so ever I have in this world though i^ be
spiritual: it is grievous and tedyous unto me / for as long as I se not my
lord openly in his glory / I se it at naught all that I se and here in this
world Lord thou art my wytnes that nothing may comfort me ne no creature
may quyete me but thou my lord God whom I desire to se and behold eternally.
But that is not possible for me to do as long as I shall be in this mortal life
/ wherefore it behooves me to keep my self in great pacyence / and to submytte
my self to the in every thing that I desire / for thy holy saints that ^owe
joy with the abode in good faith and pacyence all whiles they lived here the
coming of thy glory. That they believed I believe / that they hoped to have: I
hope to have / and thither as they by thy grace be come: I trust to come / and
till than I shall walk in faith and take conforte of the examples of the said
holy saints. I have also holy books for my solace as a spiritual glass to
look upon / and above all these I have for a synguler remedy thy holy body. I
perceive well that two things be much necessary unto me in this world /
without which this miserable life should be to me as importable / for as long
as I shall be in this body: I confess my self to have need of two things /
that is to say of meat and light. These two haste thou given unto me / that
is to say. Thy holy body to the refreshynge of my body and soul / and thou
haste set thy words as a lantern before my fete: to show me the way that I
shall go without these two I may not well live / for the word of god is the
light of my soul / and this sacrament is the bread of my life. These two may
also be called the two tables set here and there in the spiritual treasure of
holy church / the one is the table of the holy altar / having this holy
bread that is the precious body of Christ. The other is the table of the
laws of god conteyninge the holy doctrine of the law of god and instuctynge
man in the right faith / and in the true believe: leadynge him into the inward
secrets: that be called Sancta sanctorum: where the inward secrets of
scripture be hyd and contained. I yield tha^kinges to the my lord Jesus the
bryghtnes of the eternal light for this table of holy doctrine / the which
thou haste ministered to us by thy servants / prophets / and apostles and
other doctors / and thankynges also be ^o the: the creatoure and redemer of
mankind that thou to show to all the world the greatness of thy charity
preparedest a great souper in the which thou set not forth ye lamb
figured in ye old law but thy holy body and blood to be eaten / gladdi^g
thereby in that holy feast al faithful people / and gyuynge them to drink of
the chalyce of health in the which be contained all the delytes of Paradyse /
where Angels eat with us with much more plentuous swetnes. O how great and
how honorable is the office of prestes / to whom is given power to consecrate
with the holy words of consecracyon the lord of all magesty / to bless him
with their lyppes to hold him in their hands / to receive him in to their
mouths / and to mynyster him to other. O how clean should tho hands be /
how pure a mouth / how holy a body / and how vndefouled should be the heart
of a priest: to whom so often enters the auctoure of all clennes. Truly there
ought to proceed fro the mouth of a priest that so often receives the
sacrament of Christ's body / no word but that is holy / honest / and
hrofytable / his eyes should be full simple: and chaste that use to behold the
body of Christ / and his hands should be full pure and lift up in to heaven /
which use to touch the creatoure of heaven and earth / and therefore it is
specially said in the law to ye prestes Be ye holy for I your lord god am
holy. O god almighty thy grace be with us and help us that have received the
office of presthode / that we may serve the worthily and devoutly in all purety
and in a good conscience. And though we may not live in so great innocencye as
we ought to do yet give us grace at the lest tha we may weep and sorrow the
euyls that we have done / so that in spiritual mekenes and in a full purpose of
a good will we may serve the here after. Amen.

.That he that shall be houseled ought to repair him self thereto before with
great dilygence. The.xii. Chapter.
I Am the lover of all purety / and lyberall gyuer of all holiness. I seek a
clean heart / and there is my restyng place make ready for me a great chamber
strawed that is thine heart / and I with my discyples shall keep mine Ester
with the / if thou wylt that I shall come to the and dwell with the / cleanse
the of all the old fylth of sin / and cleanse also the habitacle of thine
heart / and make it pleasant and fair / exclude the world and all the
clamerous noise of sin / and sit solitary as a sparowe in a house easynge and
think upon all thy offenses with great bytternesse of heart / for a true
lover will prepare to his beloved friend ye best and the fairest place that he
can / for in that is known the love and affection of him that receives his
friend / but nevertheless I know that thou may not of thy self suffyce to
make this / preparinge fully as it ought to be in every point / though thou
went about it an hoole year together and had none other thing in thy mind
to think upon / but of my mercy and grace only / thou art suffered to go unto
my table / as if a poor man were called to the dinner of a rich man / and he
had none other thing to give him again but only to humble him self and
thank him for it / do that in the is with thy best dilygence / and do it not
only of custom nor of a necessyte only / for thou art bound to it / but
with dread and reverence and great affection / take the body of thy beloved
Lord god / that so louyngly vouched saufe for to come unto the. I am he that
has called the / I have commanded that this thing should be done I shall
supply that wants in the. Come therefore and receive me / when I give ye the
grace of deuocio^ yield thankinges to me therefore / not for yt thou art worthy
to have it / but for yt I have showed my mercy louyngly to the / and if thou
have not grace of devotion through receyuinge of this sacrament / but that
thou feleste thy self more dry and more undevout than thou were before / yet
contynewe still in thy prayer / wayle / wept and call for grace / and cease not
till thou may receive some little drope of this helthful grace of devotion.
Thou have need of me and not I of the / ne thou comeste not to sanctify me but
I come to sanctifye the and to make the better than thou were before Thou
come to be sanctified and be oned to me / and that thou may receive a
new grace / and be kyndled of new to amendeme^t / do not forget this grace
but always with all thy dylygence prepayre thy heart and bring thy beloved to
the and it behooves the not only to p^payre thy self unto deuocio^ before thou
shall be housled but that thou also keep thy self therein diligently after the
receyuynge of the sacrament: and there is no less keeping requysite after than
a devout preparacion is needful before / for a good keeping after is the best
p^paracion to receive new grace here after / and a man shall be the more
undisposed thereto / if he anon after he has received the sacrament / give
him self to outward solace / beware of much speaking / abide in some secret
place and keep the with thy lord god / for thou have him that all the world
may not take from the / I am he to whom thou must give all / so that fro
hens forth thou live not in thy self but only in me.

That a devout soul should greatly desire with all his heart to onyed to
Christ in this blessed sacrament. The.xiii. Chapter.
WHo shall grant unto me lord ye I may find the only / and open al mine
heart to the and have the as mine heart desires / so that no man may disceyue
me nor no creature move me nor draw me back but that thou only speak to me
and I to the as a lover is wont to speak to his beloved / and a friend with
his beloved friend. That is it that I pray for / that is it that I desire /
that I may be holy onyed to the / and that I may withdraw mine heart fro all
things create and through the holy communion and often saying mass to sauer
and taste eternal things. Ah lord god when shall I be al onyed to the and
holy be molten in to thy love / so that I holy forget my self / be thou in
me and I in the / and grant that we may so abide always to gether in one /
verily thou art my beloved elect and chosen before all other i^ whom my
soul coueyteth to abide all days of his life Thou art the lord of peace in
whom is the sufferayne peace and the true rest / with out whom is labor
and sorrow and infinite misery: verily thou art the hyd god and thy counsel
is not with wicked people / but with meke men and simple in heart O how sweet
and how benygne is thy holy spirit which to the intent thou would show to
thy chosen people thy swetnes / haste vouchedsafe to refresshe them with the
most sweet bread that dyscendeth from heaven. Verily there is none other
nacyon so great that has their gods so nyghe unto the^ / as thou lord god
art to all thy faithful people to whom for their daily solace and to reyse
their hertes into the love of heavenly things / thou gyuest thy self as meat
and drink.: O what people be there that be so noble as the christen people are
/ or what creature under heaven is so much beloved as the devout chryste^
soul into whom god enters and fedeth her with his own glorious flesh and
blood.: O inestimable grace / O meruaylous worthiness / O love without measure /
syngulerly showed unto man / but what shall I yield again to god for all this
grace and this high charity / truly there is nothing that is more acceptable
unto him than that / I holy give him mine heart and inwardely join my self
unto him and than shall all mine inward parts joy in him wha^ my soul is
perfytely oned into him. Than shall he say to me if thou wylt be with me I will
be with the / and I shall answer to him again and say. Vouche saufe Lord to
abide with me / and I will gladly abide with the / for that is al my desire
that my heart may be fast knyt unto the without departing. Amen.

Of the brennynge desire that some devout persons have had to the body of
Christ. The.xiiii. Cha.
O How great multitude of swetnesse is it lord that thou haste hid / for
them that dread the / but what is it than for them that love the: verily when
I remember me of many devout persons that have come to this holy sacrament
with so great feruoure of devotion I am than many times astonyed and confounded
i^ my self that I go unto thy altar and to the table of the holy communion so
coldely and with so little fervor and that I abide still so dry and without any
affection of heart and that I am not so holy kyndeled before the my lord god /
nor so strongly drawn thereby in affeccion to the as many devout persons have
been / the which of the great desire that they have had to this holy
communion / and for a feable love of heart that they have had thereto might not
refrain them self from weeping / but effectuously with the mouth of their
heart and body to gether opened their mouths to the Lord that art the lively
fountain because they could not otherwise aswage ne temper their hunger but
that they took the holy body which they did with great joy and spiritual
gredines. Truly the great bre^uing faith of them is a probable argument of thy
holy presence / and they also know verily their lord in brekynge of bread
whose hertes so strongly brenneth in the^ by the presence of their lord Jesus
sacramentally than walking with them / but verily such affeccion and devotion
and so strong fervor and love be often time far from me / be thou therefore
most sweet and benygne lord Jesus merciful and meke unto me and grant me thy
poor servant that I may feel sometime some little part of the hearty affection
of thy love in this holy co^munyon / that my faith may the more recover and
amend / and mine hope through thy goodness be the more perfect and my charity
being ones perfitly kyndeled / and having experyence of the heavenly Manna: do
never fail. Thy mercy lord is strong enough to grant to me this grace that
I so much desire / and when the time of thy pleasure shall come beningly to
visit me with the spirit of a brennyng fervor to the / and though I do not
brenne in so great desire as such special devout persons have done / yet
nevertheless I have desire by thy grace to be inflamed with that bre^nyng
desire prayeng and desyryng that I may be made part taker of all such thy
fervent lovers and to be nombred into their holy company.

:That the grace of devotion is gotten through mekenes / and forsakynge of our
self. The.xv. Chapter.
IT behooves the abydyngly to seek the grace of devotion and without ceasynge
to ask it: pacyently and fathfully to abide it: than fully to receive it /
mekely to keep it studiously to work with it / and holy to committee to god the
time and the manner of his heavenly visytacyon till his pleasure shall be to come
unto the / and pryncypally thou oughteste to meke the when thou felyste but
little inward devotion / but thou shalt not be overmuch cast down therefore
nor inordynately be heavy / for our lord gives many times in a short momente
/ that he denied long time before / he gives also sometime in the end / that
in the beginning of the prayour he deferred to grant: if grace should
always anon be granted and should anon be present after the will of him
that asks it / it should not be well able to be borne by a weke and feeble
person / and therefore in a good hope and meke pacyence the grace of devotion is
to be abydden and tarried for / and thou oughteste to arrecte it to thy selffe
and to thine own synes when grace is not given the / or that it is secretly
taken fro the. Sometime it is but a little thing that lets grace or hydeth
it away / if it may be called little / and not rather great that lets and
prohibiteth so good a thing / but whether it be little or great if thou amoue
it and perfitely overcome it / it shall be granted unto the that thou desyrest
/ and forthwith as thou betakest thy self with all thine heart to god and
desyrest neither this thing nor that for thine own pleasure / but holy
put thy will to his will / thou shalt find thy self oned to him and set
i^ a great inward peace / for nothing shall sauoure so well to the / nor so
much please the as that the will and pleasure of god be fully done in the /
who so ever therefore i^ a pure simple heart lift his intent up to god / and
void him self fro all inordinate love or displeasure of any worldely thing /
shall be more apt to recyue grace and shall be best worthy to have the gift
of devotion / for there our lord gives his blessing where he fyndeth the
vessels emptye / and void / and the more perfytely a man can renounce him
self and all worldly things / and can by dispysynge of him self the more
dry to him self / so much the sooner grace shall come and shall the more
plentuously enter into him / and the higher shall lift up his heart into God.
Than his heart shall se and abound and shall marvel and be delated in him
self for the hand of our lord is with him / and he has holy put him into
his hand for ever. Lo so shall a man be blessed that seeks God with all his
heart and takes not his soul in vain. Such a man in receiving this holy
sacrament deserves great grace of the onyng in god / for he looks not to his
own devotion and consolacyon / but to the glory and honor of god.

That we should open all our necessytes to Christ / and ask his grace.
The.xxi. Chapyter.
O Most sweet lord whom I desire devoutly to receive / thou know ye
infirmite and necessite that I am in / in how many sins and vices I lie /
how often I am grieved / tempted / troubled / and defouled I come to the for
remedy / and I make my praiour to the for comfort / and I speak unto him that
knows all things: to whom all my secret and inward thoughts be manyfeste
and open / and the which only may perfytly counsel me and help me thou
know what I need to have / and how poor I am in virtue. Lo I stand before
the poor and naked asking and desyryng thy grace. Refresshe me therefore thy
poorest servant begging for spiritual fode kyndle my heart with the fire of
thy love and illumyne my blyndenes with the clerenes of thy p^sence / turn
all worldly things into bitterness to me / and al grievous things and
contraryous things into patience / and al create things into dispisyng and
into forgettyng of them / lift up mine heart to the into heaven and suffer me
not to live vaynly ne to err in this world. Thou lord fro hensforthe shalt
be sweet to me for ever: for thou art only my mete and drink my love / my
joy / my swetnes / and all my goodness / would god that thou would kyndell
me: inflame me / and turn me holy into the that I may be made one spirit
with the by grace of i^warde oning and meltyng of brennynge love into the /
suffer me not to depart fro the fasting and dry / but work with me
mercyfully as thou haste often times meruaylously wrought with thy beloved
servants in time paste: what marvel were it / if I were all inflamed into
the / and failed in my self sith thou art the fire always brennynge and never
faylyng / the love puryfyenge the hertes / and lightening the understanding
of all thy creatures.

Of the brennynge love and great affection that we should have to receive
Christ. The.xvii. Chapter.
WIth high devotion and brennynge love / and with all feruoure and affection of
the heart I desire to receive the lord as many saints and devout persons
have desired the in their co^munyon and that most specially pleased the in the
holiness of their life and were in most brenning devotion to the. O my lord
god my lover eternal / all my goodness and felycyte without endyng. I coueyte
to receive ye with as great desire and as due reverence as any holy man ever
did or might do: and though I be unworthy to have such felinges in deuo^yon as
they had / yet neuetheles I offer to the the hole affection of my heart as
verily as if I only had all the bre^ning and flaming desires that they had /
and over that all that a meke mind may ymagyne and desire: I give and offer to
the with high reverence and worshipe and inward fervor / and I desire to
reserve no thing to my self / but me and all mine I offer to the i^ sacrifyce
freely and most liberally And also my lord god my createur and redemer / with
such affection / reuere^^ / laud and honor with such thanks / dignite and
love / and with such faith / hope and puryte I desire to receive the this
day as thy most holy and glorious mother the virgyne Mary desired and received
the / wha^ she mekely and devoutly answered the Angel that showed her the
mystery of thy incarnacio^ and said. Ecce ancilla dn^i fiat michi secundu^
verbu^ tuu^. That is to say / lo I am the hand maid of god / be it to me
after thy word / and as thy blessed precursour saint John^ the Baptyste most
excellent of all saints was glad and ioyed in great joy in ye holy ghost
through thy presence wha^ he was yet i^ his mothers womb / and after wha^ he
saw the walking among ye people very mekely and with devout affection he
said ye friend of a spouse that stands and hereth: ioyeth with great joy
for to here the voice of the spouse / and so coueyte I in great and holy
desires to be enflamed and to present my self to the with all my heart and
also I offer and yield to the all the lauds of devout hearts / the bre^nyng
affeccyons excessyue thoughts / spiritual illuminacions / and heavenly visyons
/ with all virtues and praisinges done or to be done by any creature in heaven
or in earth for me and for all the^ that be committed to my prayer: that thou
may be worthily lauded and glorified for ever / except lord god my mind
and the desires of the manyfolde lauds and blessings that by me are to the
due of right after the multitude of thy greatness more than can be spoken: and
all these I yield to the and desire to yield to the every day and every
moment: and with all my desire and affeccio^ mekely exorte and pray al heavenly
spirits and al faithful people to yield with me tha^kinges and lauds to ye /
and I beseech the that al people tribus and tongues may magnify thy holy and
thy most sweet name with great joy and brenninge devotion / and that al they
that reverently and devoutly minister this most high sacrament / or with full
faith receive it may thereby deserve to find before the thy grace and mercy
/ and when they have obtained the devotion that they desired and be spirytually
onyed to the: and be thereby well comforted and meruaylously refresshed and be
departed fro thy heavenly table / that they will have me pore sinner in their
remembrance. Amen.

:That a man shall not be a curyous sercher of this holy sacrament but a meke
follower of Christ subduynge always his reason to the faith. The.xviii. Chapter.
THou must beware of a curious and an unprofitable serching of this most
profounde sacram^t if thou wylt not be drowned in to great deppeth of
doutfulnes / for he that is serchoure of Gods magesty shall be anon thirst
out of glory: god is of power to work much more than man may understand.
Nevertheless a meke and an humble serchyng of the truth / ready always to be
taught and to talk after the teaching of holy fathers is sufferable: blessed
is that symplicite that leueth the way of hard questyons and goth in the
plain and steadfast way of the commandments of god many have lost their
devotion because they would search higher things tha^ perteyneth to the^.
Faith and a good life is asked of the and na^ the hyghnes of understanding nor
the depenes of the mysteryes of god / if thou may not understand nor take such
things as be within ye / how may thou than comp^hende those things yt be
above the / submit thy self therefore mekely to god and submytte also thy
reason to faith: and the light of knowledge and of true understanding shall be
given unto the as it shall be most profitable and necessary for ye / some be
grievously tempted of the faith and of the sacrament: but that is not to be
reputed to the^ but rather to the enemy: therefore care not for him nor disput
not with thy thoughts nor answer not to ye doutes yt thine enemy shall lay
unto the / but believe the wordis of god and believe his saints and prophets
and ye wycken enemy shall fle away fro the: and it is often times much
profitable that ye servants of god should feel and sustain such doutes for
their more proof / and commonly ye enemy tempts not unfaithful people and
si^ners who^e he has sure possessyon / but he te^pteth and vexes in diverse
manners the faithful and devout persons. Go therefore with a pure and undoubted
faith and with an humble reverence proceed to this sacrament / and what so ever
thou can not understand commit it faithfully to god. For god will not
deceive the / but he shall be deceived that trusts ouermuche to himself God
walks with the simple persons he opened himself and showed himself to meke
persons: he gives understanding to the^ that be poor in spirit: he opens
ye wet to pure clean minds / and hydeth his grace fro curyous me^ and proud
me^. Man's reason is feeble and weyke and anon may be deceived / but faith is
stable and true and can not be deceived / therefore all reason and al natural
workyng must follow faith without ferther resoning for faith and love in this
most holy and most excellent sacrament surmonte and work high in secret manner
above all reason. O the eternal god and the lord of infinite power does great
things in heaven and in earth yt may not be serched / for if the works of God
were such that they might be lightly understand by man's reason / they were
not so meruaylous and so inestimable as they be.

:Here ends the following of Christ.
HEre after follows an Epistle of saint Barnarde called ye golden Epistle
which he sent to a young religyous man whom he much loved. And to ye increase
of ye deuocyo^ of the^ yt can read English and understand not latin tongue /
it is translated out of laten into English in such manner as hereafter ensues.
And it is in some books imprynted in the latter end of the book called in
laten (Imitacio Christi) that is to say in English The following of Christ.
Than after the said Epistle follow four reuelacyons of saint Birget whereof
the first treats that nothing pleases god so much as that he be beloved
above all thing. The second treats of the lives actyue and contemplatyue.
The third shows that there shall be in time to come so great devotion in
gentyles / that Christen men spirytually shall be in manner their servants.:
The fourth declares what things be necessary to him that desires to vysyte
the lands of the infideles.

:Hhere begins the Epistle of saint Barnarde / which he sent unto a young
relygyous man / whom he much loved that is called the golden Epistell.
THat the wilderness of relygyon / may were pleasant swear unto the / and
that thou shalt not be in the sight of him found unkind / that was most
mekely crucified for ye: I counsel the yt now thou have taken it upon the
thou cast it not lyghtely away lest happily an other more acceptable to God /
than thou take it and occupye thy place / and that thou be cast out as a
stynkynge caryen. Consider therefore how much thou art bound to the veraye
true lamb / that is Christ which was led to be offered in sacrifyce for the
upon the altar of the Cross / and suffered many represses / and most hard
scourgynges of them: of whom he had such compassyon that he wept tenderly
upon them.: Therefore that thou may attain to like thing call unto thy
lord Jesus with devout prayer besechynge him that thou may as a true membre
be onyed through good virtuous works / to be very true heed / that is
Christ.: But thou may not cone to that point without his grace do help
the as well before as after. For without grace all thy workynge shall be
unprofitable and vain / like as he watches in vain that believes to keep a
city without our lord. Therefore if thou will find his grace and be trewly
solitarye / two things be necessary unto the. The first is / that thou so
withdraw thy self from all transitory things / that thou care no more for
them than if there were none such / and that thou set thy self at so vile a
price in thine own sight / that thou account thy self as naught / beleuynge
all men to be better than thou art / and more to please God. Also what so ever
thou here or se of Relygyous persons / think that they do it of a good
intent / though it seem not so / for man's suspicion is often deceived / and
therefore judge thou nothing in certain / speak another any thing that may
sound to thy own praise / but labor rather to keep thy virtue secret than
thy vices. In no wise speak no yuell of no man / how true and manyfeste so
ever it be / and more gladely give herynge when a man is praised / than when he
is dispraysed. Also when thou spekeste: let thy words be true / sobre / apt
/ weighty / and of god If a seculer man speak with the / and ask of the many
questyons / as soon as thou canste break of the tale / and set the to those
things that be of god. What worldely thing so ever be happen to the or any
other / how dear beloved so ever he be unto the / care not for it / if it be
prosperous and liking / joy not in it / and if it be myslykyng / sorrow not
for it / but think all as naught / and laud and praise almighty god. Seek
solytarinesse as much as thou can so that thou may diligently take heed of
thine own gostely health. Fly talking and vain tangelynge as much as thou
may / for it is more sure way to keep scilence than to speak. After
complain speak not till mass be done on the day following / but it be for a
great cause. When thou seste any thing that displeases the / consider whether
there be not like thing in the that displeases other / and if there be cut it
lyghtely away. And if thou se or here any thing that pleases the / consider
whether it be in the / and if it behold it warely / and if it be not take it
to the / and so it shall be to the as a glass to look upon. Grudge at nothing
toward no man / but when thou beleueste it may profit his soul health /
how grievous so ever it be to ye / never afferme nor deny any thing hedyly /
but let thy denyenges and affyrmynges be always tempred with discrecyon.
Abstain thy self always from all mockynges and fro all dyssolute laughynges.
In all thy sayenges behave the so that thou have a certain of all thy deeds
and words that they be true / and those that be doubtful / let them go as
things that be evil.: The second that is necessary unto the is / that thou
shalt so fully offer thy self to god that thou shalt say nothing: nor do
nothing / but that thou beleueste verily will please him / and take heed of
thy service with great devotion / so that that thou sayeste with thy mouth be
also in thy heart.: Have these three things always in thy mind / what thou
haste been / what thou art / and what thou shalt be. what thou haste been /
stynkynge corrupcyon. What thou art / a vessel full of dunge What thou shalt
be / meat for worms. Also think on the pains of them that be in hell / and
that they shall never be ended. And that for a little delectacyon in this
world they suffer those pains. And likewise think in the glory of the
kingdom of heaven the which shall never have end / and that lyghtely and in
short time it may be won.: And than remember how great sorrow and
waylynge shall be to them that have lost so great a glory for so little a
thing. Also when thou haste any thing that dyspleaseth the or greueth the /
think if that thou shalt come to hell / thou shalt have always that
dyspleasure / and all other also that thou most dredest when any pryncipall
feast comes / think on that Saint that than is worshypped in the church of
god / what things he suffered for Christ / for they were but short and what
he wanne thereby / for they be everlasting. Think also that as well the
torments of goodmen / as the joys of yuell men in this world be paste and
gone / and that nevertheless good men by their torments / have received
eternal glory / and yuell men by their short worldly joy eternal pain /
and though thou be never so slothful / yet take this little writynge and
remember and ymagyne all these things dilygently that I have said / and at
the least bethynke the on the time that thou thus leseste / and that they that
be in hell would give all the world for it. When thou haste any tribulacions /
think that they that be in heaven want them / and that they that be in hell
have many mo. Every day at the lest when thou go to bed / examyne
diligently what thou haste thought the day before / what thou have done / and
what thou have said / and how thou have spent ye p^cious time yt was given the
to win there in the kingdom of heaven. And if thou have paste it well / thank
God and laud him for it / and if thou haste spent it yuell and neglygently: be
sorry for it / and defer not the next day to be confessed: than I put this in
the end / to thentent that thou shall diligently ymagine as it were two cities
before the / one full of all turmentes as hell is / the other full of all
co^solacyon / as is the kingdom of heaven / and that it behooves the of
necessyte to enter and come into the one of them / behold than what might draw
the against thy will unto the yuell city / and what might set the from the
good city / and I trow that thou shall find nothing that might do it (if
thou woldeste with all thine heart turn the to god / and puttyng away all
negligence / would mekely call to him for grace and mercy) the which that is
most blessed above all vouche safe to grant unto us. Amen.

:That nothing pleasethe God so much as that he be beloved above all thing as
our lady shows to saint Birget by example of a pagan woman / which optayned
great grace for the great love she had to her creature / as it apperyth in
the.vi. book of saint Birgettes reuelacyons. The.l. Chapter.
THe mother of god our lady saint Mary speaks to the spouse of her son
saint Birget / saienge thus. Nothing so much pleases god / as that a man
love him above all thing / as I shall show to the by a symylytude of a Pagan
woman / which knowing nothing of the faith / though to her self thus I
know said she of what matter I am come in to this world / and of what things
I came in to my mothers womb. And I believe that it had been impossible that I
should have had my body so knyt together as it is / and my reason and
understanding / but they had be given unto me / and therrfore I know well
there is some creatoure and master of me that has made me a reasonable
creaure / not deformed me like unto worms or serpents / wherefore me thinks
that though I had many husbands and all they called me / I would rather come
at one calling of my creatoure than at the calling of them all. I have also
many sons and many daughters / and ne nevertheless if I saw them have meat
in their hands / and I knew my creatoure to want meat / I would take the
meat from my children and would gladly give it unto my creator / I have also
many possessions / which I order after mine own will / and nevertheless if I
knew the will of my creator / I would gladely leave mine own will and
dyspose them to his honor. But my daughter se what god did with this pagan
woman. He sent unto her one of his elect servants / that instructed her in
the faith / and god him self visyted her heart as thou may well know and
understand hereafter by the answer of the woman.: For when that man showed
unto her that there was one god without beginning / and without endyng that
is to say the creatoure and maker of all things / he answered and said. It is
well to be believed that he yt has created me and all things / that he has no
creator above him / and it is like that his life is everlasting that might
give me life.: And when the woman herd ferther that the same creatoure took
manhoude of a vyrgyne / and that he preched in this world / and taught the
people in his own person / she answered. It is to believe god in every thing
/ and than she said further: I pray the show me what be the words that my
Creatoure did speak and command / for I will holly leave mine own will /
and fully obey unto him / and to every word that he has spoken. Than when he
declared unto her of the passion of our lord / of his cross / his death / and
of his resurrection. The woman with great weeping answerered and said. Blessed
be my creator yt so pacyently shows his charity in the world / that he had
to us in heaven. And therefore if I loved him / first because he created me / I
am now more bounden to love him / because he has showed me the streght way
unto heaven / and has redeemed me with his precious blood / and I am bound
therefore to serve him with all my strength and all ye parts of my body / and
I am bounden also to remove all my desire from me that I had / first to my
possessions / and to my children and kynsmen / and only to desire to se my
creatoure in his glory that never shall have end. Than said our blessed lady
to saint Birget (Lo daughter) How great reward that woman had for her great
love. So is daily given great reward to every man after the love that he
has unto god while he lives in this world.

:Our lord Jesus Christ gives to his spouse saint Birget a notable doctrine
of ye lives Actyue and Conte^platiue which be notable sygnifyed by Martha / and
Mary Magdaleyne / that is to say how a man shall begin and profit in the
life spu^all / and in grace and virtue that he may finally ascend unto the
high degree of the love of god / and of his neighbor / which doctrine
appears in the.vi. book of the reuelacyons of saint Birget. The.lxv. Chapter.
THe sone of god speaks to his spouse saint Birget / saying thus.: There be
two lives which be lykened to Martha / and Mary Magdaleyne / and who so ever
will follow those two lives must make pure confession of all his sins /
taking very contricyon for them / having full will never after to offend. And
the first life as I do witness my self in my gospel / Mary Magdaleyne did
chose which ledeth a man to conte^placion / that is to say to the beholdinge
of heavenly things / and that is the best part and is the very way of the life
everlasting. Therefore every man that coueyteth to follow the life of Mary /
that is to say the life contemplatyue It suffyseth to him to have only the
necessaryes for the body / that is to say clothing without vanyte / mete and
drink in scarsyte / and not insuperfluytye. Chastity without any yuell
delectacyon fasting and abstynence after the ordinance of the church / and
he that fasteth must take heed that he be not ouermuche enfebled and made
weyke by his unreasonable fasting / lest thoroughe that weyknes he be
enforced to leave his prayers and his counsel gyuynge / or other good deeds /
wherewith he might both profit him self and his neighbor also. And he
must also dilygently take heed that he be not through his fasting ye more
slow to justice / nor more slaker to the works of mercy / for why: to punyshe
rebels / and to bring infideles under the yoke of the faith is requysyte great
strength as well of body / as of soul. Therefore every seek person that would
rather to the honor of god: fast then ete / shall have like reward for his
good will / as he that fasteth of charytie. And in like wise / he that for
obedyence eteth / desyring rather to fast: tha^ to eat shall have like
reward as he yt fastethe Second the contemplatyue man shall not joy of the
honor of the world / nor of the prosperyte thereof / ne sorrow for his
aduersyte / but he shall joy specially in this / that wicked men be come
devout men / that lovers of the world be come lovers of God / and that good
men profit in goodness / and be through good labor and dilygence in the
service of god made daily more devout than other Of this also the
contemplatyue man shall sorrow that sinners be made daily worse and worse /
that almighty god is not beloved of his creatures / as he ought to be / and
that the commandments of God be despised and set at naught. Thyrdely the
contemplatyue man may not be ydell / ne no more may he that uses the actyue
life / but anon when he has taken his necessary sleep he shall rise and
thank almighty God with all his heart / for that he has create and made all
things / and that of his charity by taking our nature he has reformed and
renewed mankind / showing by his passion and death the love that he has to
man / which is so great that none can be greater. Also the contemplatyue man
shall thank almighty God for all them that be saved / and for all them that
be in purgatory / and for them that yet be living in the world / prayenge
mekely for them unto our lord that he suffer them not to be tempted above
their power.: The contemplatyue man also must be dyscrete in his prayers / and
well ordered in his lauds and praysynges of God / for if he have sufficyent to
live with without labor or business / he must make the longer prayers. And
if he be weary and temptatyon rise in his prayers / he may labor with his
hands some honest and profitable work / either for him self if he have need
or for other. And if he be in manner yrkesome with both / that is to say: with
prayer and labor / than he may have some other honest occcupacion or here
some good wholesome words / or profitable counseyls in all sobernes / all
scur^ylytie and unclean words set aparte till the body and soul be made
more apt / and more able to the service of god. And if the contemplatyue man
have not sufficyent to live with all / but through his labor / than may he
make the short prayers for his necessary labor / and that labor shall be the
perfeccion and encreasynge of his prayer / and if he can not labor nor may
not / than let not him be ashamed / ne think it not grievous to beg / but
rather that he be joyous for it / for than he follows me the son of God that
made my self poor: to make man rich / and if the contemplatyue man be under
obedyence / than he must live after the obedyence of his prelate / and his
reward shall be double more than if he were at lybertye. Fourthly the
contemplatyue man may not be couytous / no more may the actyue man / nor he
may not be prodygall for as the actyue man dystrybuteth temporal goods for
god / so the contemplatyue man must distrybute his spirytuall goods. Morouer
if the contemplatyue man will have almighty god inwardly in his heart: let him
beware to say thus as many do. It suffyseth to me if I can save mine own
soul / for if I can do so / what have I to do with the deeds of other men / or
if I be good my self / what is it to me how other live. O my daughter / they
that say or think so / if they saw their friend dishoneste and troubled / they
would run with all their power to the death / that their friend might be
delivered out of his trouble / so shall the contemplatyue man do / he must
sorrow that almighty god is offended that his brother which is his neighbor
has occasyon to offend. And if any fall into syn / the contemplatyue man
shall endeavor him all that he can to help him out of his sin with all
discressyon. And if he have trouble or persecucyon for it / let him leave
that place and seek an other place that is more quiet. For I my self that am
very good / said unto my discyples thus. If they persecute you in one city
fly ye in to an other: and so did Paul / the which by cause he should be
more necessary an other time / was let go by a wall in a basket. Therefore that
the contemplatyue man may be lyberall and pitious / there be five things
necessary unto him. The first is a house in the which his gestes may sleep.
The second is clothing to clothe the naked. The third is meat to feed the
hungry. The fourth is fire to warm them that be cold. The fifte is medicines
for them that be seek that is to say: good confortable words with the charity
of god.:The house of the contemplatyue man is his heart / whereof the yuell
ghestes be all tho things that trouble his heart / that is to say / wrath /
heuenesse / couetyse / pride / and many other like. Therefore all tho vices when
they come / they shall in manner like as ghestes that be on sleep / and as they
that be at rest. For as an host receives yuell ghestes / and good with
pacyence / so the contemplatyue man must suffer all things / for god through
virtue of pacyence / and in no wise to consent to vices / not to them that seem
lest ne to delight in them / but as much as he may be little and little
through the help of grace / to remove them clearly out of the heart. And if
he can not clearly remove them / he must suffer them pacyently against his
will as enemies: and never to assent to them knowing certeynly that they shall
profit him to the greater reward in heaven and not to dampnacion. Second the
contemplatyue man must have clothes to cloth his ghestes / that is to say
meekness both inward and outewarde / and compassyon of mind for the
afflyction of his neighbor. And if the contemplative man be despised of ye
world let him think how I the God almighty being contempned and despised
suffered pacyentely / and when I was judged I held my peace / and when I was
scourged: and crowned with thorns I murmured not. The contemplatyue man also
must take heed / that he show not to them that reprove him / or rebuke him
any sins of anger or impacyence / but that he bless the^ that persecute him
/ that they that se it may bless god whom ye contemplatyue man does follow /
and almighty god shall give blessings for tho maledi^cyons. The contemplatyue
man must be ware also that he do not speak yuell of them nor rebuke them that
do grieve him / for it is dampnable to bacbyte other / and wylfully to here them
that do bacbyte / or thoroughe impacyence for to reprove or rebuke his
neighbor. Than that the contemplatyue man may have perfytely the gift of
mekenes and pacyence / he must study to admonysshe and warn them that do
bacbyte other / of the great peril that they stand in / and that he exorte
them in all charity with words and with examples to perfyte mekenes. Also the
clothing of the contemplatyue man must be compassyon / for if these his
neighbors do any sin: he must have compassyon of him / prayenge to almighty
god to have mercy upon him.: And if he se him suffer any wrong or hurt / or
reprove: he must be sorry for him and help him with his prayers / and with his
aid and dilygence / and that if need be before the great Men of the world
for the true perfyte compassyon sekethe not that is his / but that is his
neighbors. And if the contemplatyue man be such a one that he is not herd
with princes / and that it profytethe not that he go out of his self.: Than he
shall pray heartily for them that be in trouble and almighty god that is the
beholder of man's heart / for the charytye of him that prays / shall turn
the hertes of the people to the peace and quietness of him that is in trouble
/ so that he shall either be delivered out of his trouble / or he shall have
pacyence sent him of god to suffer it / and so his reward shall be doubled.
Therefore such clothing / that is to say: mekenes and compassyon must be in the
heart of the contemplative man for nothing so myghtely draws god in to the
heart as mekenes and compassyon of the neighbor does. Thyrdely the
contemplative man must have meat and drink for his gestes / for sometime yuell
gestes do lodge in the heart of the contemplative man / that is to say when the
heart is drawn fro beholdynge of it self: and coueteth things delectable /
to se worldely things / to have possession of temporal goods. And when the
eeres desire to here his own honowre / the flesh desires to delight in
carnal things / the spirit leyth excuse of his fraylnesse / and that syne is
but light and when there comes a paynfulnesse and an hardenesse for to do good
deeds / and a forgetfulness of things to come.:And when he thinks his good
deeds great and forgets his yuell deeds. Against all such ghestes it is
necessary for the contemplatyue man to have good counseyle / and not to
dyssemble as though he were a sleep / but that be armed strongely with true
faith answer unto such ghestes: saying thus. I will have nothing of temporal
goods but barely for the sustaynynge of my bodily kind / and I will not
spend hour nor time but to the honor of god nor I will not take heed what is
fair or foul in the world / ne what is pleasant or displeasaunt to the
flesh: or sauoury / or not sauoury to the mouth / but to ye pleasure of god
and health of my soul / for I would not let one hour but to the honor of
god. Such a will is mete and drink for the ghestes that come / and that answer
extyncteth and puts away all inordynate delytes and pleasures of the world
and of the flesh. Fourthly the co^te^platyue man must have fire to warm his
ghestes and to give them light / this fire is the heart of the holy ghost / it
is impossible any man to leave his own will or to forsake the carnal love of
his friends or the love of riches / but thoroughe the instincte and hete of the
holy ghost. Also the contemplatyue man / how holy and perfyte so ever he be /
may not of him self begin nor continue in good life without help of grace
in the holy ghost. Therefore that the contemplatyue man may set a light before
his ghestes. First let him think thus: Almighty God has created me / that I
should honor him above all things. And in honourynge him / that I should
love him and dread him / and he was borne of a virgyne to teach me the way to
heaven / and that I should follow that way in all mekenes. And with his death
he opened the gates of heaven / that I should with gre^ate desire have me
thither. Also the contemplatyue man must examyne diligently all his deeds /
all his thoughts and all his affeccyons / that is to say how he has offended
god / and how patiently god sufferethe man / and how many ways he calls
man unto him / such thoughts and such ghestes of the contemplatyue man: be
in manner but as they were a sleep / but they be illumynate with the fire of ye
holy ghost / the which fire than comethe in to the heart when the contemplatyue
man thinks how reasonable it is to serve God / and when he thinks that he
had lever suffer all pain / than wyttyngly no provoke God to wrath / whose
goodness his soul is create and made / and it is also redeemed with his precious
blood. Than also the heart has hete of his heavenly fire / that is the holy
ghost / when the soul thinks and dyscernethe to what intent every ghest /
that is to say / every thought ^ommethe. And whether it move the mind to
couyte joy perpetually or tra^sitorie / and that he leave no thought
vndyscussed: ne uncorrected with dread of god.: Therefore that this fire may be
gotten / and when it is gotten that it may be falsely kept.: The contemplatyue
man must lay to dry sticks / that is to say: he must dilygently take heed
of the mocyons of the flesh / that it rebel not against the spirit. And he
must put to all his dylygence that the words of pity and good prayers may
be devoutly increased / wherewith the holy ghost may have delight / but he
must specially know and consider that where a fire is made in a close vessel
that has no auoydau^ce anon the fire goes out / and the vessel wereth
cold.: So it is with the contemplatyue man / if he would not live to nothing
else but that he might do honor to God / It is expedyent that his mouth be
opened / and that the flame of his charytye go forth. Than is the mouth
opened when by his speaking which proceeds of fervent charytye / he gets
spiritual children to god / but the co^templatyue man must take good head that
he open his mouth to preach / where good men shall be made more fervent / and
where yuel men may be amended / where ryghtwysenes may be increased / and
yuell customs may be put away. For the Apostle Paul sometime would have
spoken but the holy ghost did prohybyte him / and sometime he held his peace /
and wha^ time conuenye^t came (he spoke) and sometime he used soft words / and
an other time more sharper words / and always he ordered his words to the
honor and glory of god / and to the confortynge and strenthynge of the faith.
And if the contemplative man may not preach but he has good will and conning
to preach and lacks good hearers / he must do as the fore does / the
which goth about many mountains and serchethe with his fete in many places
and where he fyndeth the softeste place / and most apt for him / there he
makes a dene to rest him in. So the contemplatyue man must assay with words /
with examples / and with good prayers / the hertes of many people / and where
he fyndeth the hertes most apt to here the words of god / there he must tarry
in counsaylynge and inducynge the people to God all that he can. The
contemplatyue man also must labor all that he can that convenient auoydance
may be had for his flame / for the greater that the flame is the mo be
illumined and made hot thereby. Than has the flame conuenyente auoydaunce /
when the contemplatyue man neither dredeth rebukes ne coueyteth not his own
praise / when he neither dredeth aduersites / ne delyteth him not in
prosperytyes: and than it is more pleasure to God that he do his good deeds
openly than pryuely / that they that se them may glorifye god. And it is to
understand: that the contemplatyue man must put forth two flames / one
secretly / an other openly / that is to say he must have a double mekenes.:
The first must be within forth in the heart. the second must be without
forth to the world. The first is that the contemplatyue man think him self
unworthy and unprofitable to all good warkes. and that he prefer not him
self in his own sight above no man / ne that he coueyte not to be lauded nor
to be seen in the world that he fly pride / and desire god above all thing /
following his words and his teachinges. And if the contemplatyue man put forth
such a flame with good warkes / than his heart shall be illumyned with charytye /
and all the contrarious things that come unto him shall lightly be suffered and
overcome. The second flame must be openly / for if perfyte mekenes be in the
heart / it must also appear in his apparel without forth / and be herd in
his words / and be performed in his deeds. True meekness is in the apparel /
when the contemplatyue man coueytet more to have clothing of small price which
is profitable / than clothyng of greater value whereby he may fall in to pride
/ and in to a desire to be seen in the world / for that apparel that is
little worth: and is called in ye world vile and abiecte / is very fair and
precious before god / for it provoke mekenes. And that apparel that is of
great price and is called fair in the world / is very foul and unseemly
before god / for for it takethe away the fayrenes of angels / that is to say
meekness.: But if the contemplatyue man for any reasonable cause be
constrained to have an habyt somewhat better than he would: let him not be
troubled therefore / for his reward shall thereby be increased. Also the
conte^platyue man must have meakenes in his mouth / that is to say in
speaking meke things / eschewynge all rybaldry and superfluytye of words /
not speaking subtylly ne disceytfully / ne preferrynge his sentence before
other. And if the contemplatyue man here him self praised for any good deeds /
let him not be lift up in his heart therefore / but that he answer thus. All
laud and honor be to god that gyuech all things. What am I but duste in the
wind / or what goodness commethe of me that am naught else but dry earth
without water?: And if he be reproved in the world / let him not be moved
therewith / but that he answer thus. I am worthy all this and much more for I
have so often offended god / and have not made amends therefore again. Therefore
pray ye for me thereby suffering of such temporal reproues / I may escape the
shames and reproues everlasting. And if the contemplatyue man be provoked to
anger or wrath by the ungoodly dealing of his neighbors let him be well
war and take good head that he answer not indiscreetly / for commonly pride
follows anger and wrath. Therefore it is good counsel / that when anger or
pride come: that he hold his peace so long time / till the will may ask
help of God to suffer / and to take good auysemente how and what to answer /
that he may first overcome him self / and than the wrath shall be abated in
the heart / so that he may answer wisely to them that be unwise.::Thou shalt
know also that the devil has great envy to a contemplatyue man: and if he
can not hinder him by breaking of the commandments of god / than he will
stir him to be either lightly moved with wrath / or to be dysposed to sum
vain and indiscreet mirth / or else to have some vain and unprofitable
words.: Therefore the co^templatyue man must always ask help of god that all
his words and deeds be governed by him and be holly directed unto him. And the
contemplatyue man must have meekness in all his works / that is to say /
that he do nothing for worldly praise / ne that he attempt no new thing of
him self / and that he be not ashamed of no work how vile so ever it be / so
that he may thereby please god / that he fly syngularytye that he do good to
all that he can / and in every good deed that he does / think that he might
have do better.: Also he must chose to sytte rather with poor men than with
rich / rather to obey tha^ to command / to keep scylence rather than to
speak / to be solytarye than to be with mighty men or with his worldely
friends.: Also the contemplatyue man must hate his own will / often remember
his death / fly curiosyte / all murmuringe and grudgynge / always remember the
ryhgtwysenesse of god / and take heed of his own affeccyons. Also the
contemplatyue man must often use confession be stable and dilygent in his
temptacyons / and not be desire to live to none other entente / but that the
honor of God / and health of souls may be increased. Than if the
contemplatyue man that has such affeccyons and such desires as is said
before / be chosen into the office of an Actyue man / and of obedyence and
charity to god he takes upon him the rule of other he shall have a double
reward / as it may appear by this symylytude. There was a myghtie man that
had a ship charged with precious marchaundises / which said to his servant
this. Go ye with this ship to such a port / for there I shall have right
great increase / if ye wind rise labor manfully and yrke not at it / for
your reward shall be great. After as the servant sailed / a great wind rose /
the storms wexed great and the ship was tossed and broken grievously. Than
the governor of the ship wexed weary and slow and all that were in the ship
dispeyred of their lives / and agreed to go to some other port whyther as the
wind would drive them / and not to that port that their lord had appointed
them to. And that hearing / one of the most faithful servants and most
feruente / sorowynge through great zele and love that he had to his Lord
took upon him the governance of the ship / and with strength brought the
ship to the port that the lord assigned them to go to.:Is not that man that
so manfully brought the ship to the port / worthy to have greater reward
than any of his fellows? Yes trewely.: So it is of a good ruler that for the
love of god / and health of souls / takes upon him the charge of governance
of other / and cares not for the honor / and trewely he shall have a double
reward. First he shall be part taker of the good deeds of al them that he
brings to the safe port. Second his glory shall be increased without end.
And contrariwise it shall be of them that come to honor and prelacy by their
ambicyon for they shall be part takers of all the pains and offenses of all
them that they took upon them to rule. Second their confusion shall never have
end for prelates that coueyte honors / be more like to strumpettes than to
prelates / for they deceive their subjects by their yuel examrles and their
yuel words / and be not worthy to be called neither Contemplatyue me^ nor
Actyue me^ / but they amend and do due penance. Fyftly the co^templatyue man
must give medicyns to his ghestes / that is to say / he must conforte them
with good words / and to all things that come / liking or mystykynge /
plesaunt or dyspleasaunt he must say thus. I will every thing that it
pleases our lord that I should will / though I should go unto hell. And
truly such a will is a medicine to all things that come unto the heart / and
is all delight in a troubles that come / and a great temperaunce in all
prosperyte. But because the contemplatyue man has many enemies / therefore he
must often make confession / for as long as he wylfully abides in sin /
having time and oportunytie to be confessed / and is neglyente or hedeth it not
he is rather to be called an Apostata before god than a contemplatyue man. The
actyue life.: Also the deeds of a man that lives in the actyue life. Thou
shalt understand that though the part of the contemplatyue man be best /
that yet the part of the actyue man is not yuell but it is very laudable / and
much pleasant to god: therefore I shall show the uowe how the actyue man
must order him self.: He must have as ye contemplative man has five
things. The first is true faith of holy church The second is that he knows
the commandments of god and the cou^sailes of the euangelycall truth / and
them he must perform / in will / word / and deed.:Thirdely he must refrain
his tongue from all yuell words / that are agannste god and his neighbor / and
his handdes from all unhonest and unlawful deeds. And his mind from overmuch
desire of worldely goods / and from ouergreate delight of worldly pleasures /
and learn to be content with that God has sent him / and to desire no
superfluous things. Fourthly he shall do the deeds of mercy reasonably in all
meekness / so that for trust of tho good deeds / he in nothing offend god.
Fyftly he must love god above all things / and than him self / as Martha did
/ for she gave her self gladly to me following my words and deeds / and
afterward she gave all her goods for my love / and lothed all temporal
things desyryng only things everlasting / and therefore she sustained all
things pacyently as they came / and cared as well for the health of other as of
him self / thinking always on my charity and on my possyon / and she was
glad in troubles / merry in adversities / and loved all people as a mother her
child. She would also often follow me when I was in the world / desiring
nothing but to here me. She also had compassyon of them that were in trouble.:
She conforted them that were in heaviness / releued them that were syke / she
cursed no man ne said yuel to no man / but dissymuled the yuell manners of her
neighbors all that she might / and prayde always for them.: Therefore every man
that desires to live charytabely in the actyue life must follow Martha /
loving his neighbor to the end that he may come to heaven / but not to
favor his sin or yuell life / flyenge his own praise / and pride and
doubleness of heart and wrath and envy he may not follow. But thou shalt
understand / that when Martha prayde for her brother Lazar that was deed / she
came first to me / but her brother was not raised forwith upon her coming /
but afterward Mary was called / and when she came than at ye prayer of them
both together their brother was raised from death. So it is spirytually / for
he that desires perfytely to come to the life contemplatyue must first
exercise him self well in the Actyue life / labourynge all that he may to the
honor of god in good bodily labors. And learn first to resyste all flesshly
desires / and to withstand mightily the fendes temptacyons / and than he may
afterward with good delyberacyon ascend to the higher deg^e that is to say
to the life contemplatyue / for he that is not proved and well assayed with
temptacyons / and has not yet fully ouercomme the yuell mocyons of the flesh
/ may not holly set him self to heavenly things. But who is the deed
brother of the actyue man and of the contemplatyue man / but their indiscreet
deeds / for many times a good deed is done with an indiscreet intent and of an
inconstant mind / and therefore it is but as it were deed.: Wherefore that a
good deed may be acceptable to god / it is raised again and comes to life by
the active man and by the co^templatyue man / that is to say wha^ the
neighbor is purely loved for god and to god / and god is only desired for
him self above all things And than every good deed of man or woman is
pleasant to god. Therefore I said in my gospel / that Mary had chosen the
better part.

:The life of the actyue man is good when he sorowethe for the sins of his
neighbors / but his part is better wha^ he labors all that he may that
his neighbors may do well / and persevere well unto the end / and that he do
all that he does for the love of god. But the part of the contemplatyue man is
best when he only beholds heavenly things / and the health of souls. When
the mind is fulfilled with good affec^yons / and when he is well at rest from
the clamorous noise of worldely business / and thinks always God to be
present unto him / and sets his medytacyons fully in the love of God / and
laboreth feruente fully therein both day and also the night.

Christ says / that the devotion of thinfideles in time to come shall be much
more than the devotion of the christen men / and they shall all sing joy be
to the father / unto the son / and to the holy ghost / and honor to al his
saints. Amen. The.vi. book of the reuelacions of saint Byrgete / the.lxxxiii.
Chapter.
THe son of god speaks unto his spouse saint Byrget / sainge. Thou shalt
know that yet there shall be so much deuotyon in the infideles / that christen
men shall be as their spirytuall servants / and scripture shall be fulfilled that
says.: The people not understanding shall gloryfye me / and deserts shall be
builded again / and they shall all joy be unto the father / to the son / and
to the holy ghost / and honor unto all the Saints. Amen.

.What things be necessary to him that desires to vysyte the lands of the
infidels. The.vi. book of ye reuelacions of Saint Byrgette. The.xl^. Chapter.
in the end of the said Chapter.
THe son of god speaks to saint Byrget / and says he that desires to
visyte the lands of the infidels ought to have.v. things. The first is that
he discharge his conscience with true confession and contricion / as though he
should forth with dye. Second that he put away al lyghtnesse of manners and
of apparyll / not taking head to new customs or vanytyes / but to such
laudable customs as his auncesters have used before time. Thyrdly that he have
no temporal thing but / for necessytye and to the honor of god / and if he
know any thing vnryghtwysely gotten either by him self or by his auncesters
that he restore it / whether it be little or great. Fourthly / that he labor
to the intent that the unfaithful men may come to the true catholycall faith
/ not desyringe their goods ne catell: or any other thing but to the only
necessytye of the body.:Fyftely that he have full will gladly to dye for the
honor of god / and so to dyspose him self in laudable conuersacyon that he
may deserve to come to a good and a blessed endinge. Amen.
