A Proclamacion against those that does innouate, alter or leave down any
Rite or Ceremony in the Church, of their private authority: and against them
which preaches without license, set forth the.vj. day of Februarij, in the
second year of the Kings Majesty's most gracious reign.
THe kyngnes highness by the advice of his most entierly beloved Uncle, the
Duke of Somersette, Governor of his most royal person, and Protector of all
his Realms, Dominions and Subjects, and others of his Counsel: Considering
nothing so much, to tend to the disquietyng of his realm, as diversity of
opinions, and variety of Rites and Ceremonies, concerning Religion and
worshippyng of almighty God, and therefore studiyng all the ways and means,
which can be to direct this Church and the Cure, committed to his highness,
in one and most true doctrine, Rite and Usage: Yet is advertised that certain
private Curates, Preachers, and other lay men, contrary to their bounden
duties of obedience, does rashely attempt of their own and singular wit
and mind, in some Parish Churches and otherwise, not only to persuade the
people, from the old and accustomed Rites and Ceremonies, but also theimself
brings in new and strange orders, every one in their Church, according to
their fantasies: The which as it is an evident token of pride and arrogancy,
so it tends both to confusion and disordre, and also to the high displeasure
of almighty God, who loves nothing so much as order and obedience: Wherefore
his Majesty straightly charge and commands, that no manner person, of
what estate, order, or degree so ever he be, of his private mind, will or
fantasy, do omit, leave down, change, alter or innouate any order, Rite
or Ceremony, commonly used and frequented in the Church of England, and not
commanded to be left down at any time, in the reign of our late sovereign
lord his highness father other then such as his highness, by the advice
aforesaied, by his majesty's visitours, Iniunccions, Statutes or Proclamacions,
has already or hereafter shall command, to be omitted, left, innouated, or
changed: But that they be observed after that sort, as before they were
accustomed, or else now sith prescribed, by the authority of his majesty,
and by the means aforesaied, upon pain that whosoever shall offend, contrary
to this Proclamacion, shall incur his highness indignacion, and suffer
imprisonment, and other grievous punishementes, at his majesty's will and
pleasure.

AND to the intent that rash and sedicious Preachers, should not abuse his
highness people, it is his Majesty's pleasure, that whosoever shall take upon
him to preach openly, in any parrishe Church, Chapel, or any other open
place, other then those, which be licensed by the kings majesty, or his
highness Visitours, the Archebishoppe of Canterbury, or the Bishop of the
Diocese where he does preach: Except it be the Bishop, Person, Vicar,
Deane, Warden, or Provost, in his or their own Cure, shall be furthwith upon
such attempt and preaching, contrary to this Proclamacion, committed to
prisone, and there remain until such time, as his majesty by the advice
aforesaid, has taken order for the further punishment of the same. And that
the premises should be more spedely and diligently done and performed, his
highness gives straightly in commandment, to al Justices of Peace, Maiours,
Shiriefes, Constables, head Borrowes, Church, Wardens, and all other his
Majesty's Officers and Ministers, and rulers of Tounes, Parrishes, and
Hamlettes: That they be diligent and attendaunt, to the true and faithful
excucion of this Proclamacion, and every part thereof, according to the intent,
purport and effect of the same. And that they of their procedynges herein (or
if any offender be) after they have committed the same to prison, do certify
his highness, the lord Protector, or his majesty's Counsel, with all speed
thereof accordyngly: as they tender his majesty's pleasure, the wealth of the
realm, and will answer to the contrary, at their uttermost perilles.

God save the King.
