WHereas the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Knights, Citizens and
Burgesses in Parliament Assembled, Having taken into their serious
Consideration, the great Mischiefs which this Our Kingdom lies under, by reason
that the Coin, which Passes in Payment, is generally Clipped; And they being of
Opinion, that the most Effectual way to put a Stop to this Evil, is to Prevent
the Currency thereof, as soon as We in Our Wisdom should think fit, have
severally, by their humble Addresses, besought Us to Issue Our Royal
Proclamation in that behalf: And We being deeply Sensible of the great
Prejudice which Our good Subjects undergo by such Diminution of the Current
Coins, and being very desirous to Apply a Speedy and Suitable Remedy thereto,
Have thought fit to Declare and Command, and by and with the Advice of Out
Privy Council, We do by this Our Royal Proclamation Declare and Command, That
from and after the First Day of January next Ensuing, no Clipped Crowns or
Half-Crowns shall pass in any Payment, except only to the Collectors and
Receivers of Our Revenues and Taxes, or upon Loans or Payments into Our
Exchequer; And that from and after the Third Day of February next Ensuing, no
Clipped Crowns or Half-Crowns shall Pass in any Payment whatsoever, within Our
City of London, or within Forty Miles Distance of the same; And that from and
after the Two and twentieth Day of the said Month of February, no Clipped
Crowns or Half-Crowns shall Pass or be Current in any Payment whatsoever,
within Our Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, or Town of Berwick upon
Tweed. And We do hereby Declare and Command, That from and after the Thirteenth
Day of February next, no Piece of Money, called Shillings, Clipped within the
Ring, shall Pass in any Payment, except only to the Collectors and Receivers of
Our Revenues and Taxes, or upon Loans or Payments into Our Exchequer; And that
from and after the Second Day of March next, no such Shillings, Clipped within
the Ring, shall Pass in any Payment whatsoever. And We do also hereby Declare
and Command, That from and after the said Second Day of March next, no other
Money whatsoever, Clipped within the Ring, shall Pass in any Payment, except
only to the Collectors and Receivers of Our Revenues and Taxes, or upon Loans
or Payments into Our Exchequer; And that from and after the Second Day of April
next, no such Money, Clipped within the Ring, shall Pass in any Payment
whatsoever.

Given at Our Court at Kensington the Nineteenth Day of December, 1695. In the
Seventh Year of Our Reign.
