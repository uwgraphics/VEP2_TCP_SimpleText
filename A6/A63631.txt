THE True pattern of Constancy: OR, The Loyal Lovers Joys Completed.
When Young Men find their Love's unkind,
they then impatient grow,
But when their Grief does find Relief,
it Expiates their Woe.
To an Excellent New Tune: Or, Farewell the Flower of false deceit, etc.
This may be Printed,

R. P.







FArewell thou Flower of false deceit,
and I wish the height of you may fade,
That your Countenance may altered be,
and your Honor in the Dust be laid.
Never was a Man more true than I,
as you your self full well do know;
Till I found you in your Cruelty,
that you sought my final Overthrow.
I wish the bright Sun may not shine
on thee, as it has done before;
For your Countenance has me beguiled,
I can love again, but you no more.
Once I could have been as constant Sweetheart
for to cross the Ocean Seas for thee,
As Vulcan did for Venus's sake,
when he Sailed into Italy.
If you were as fair as Rosamond was,
with her Cherry Cheeks and dimpled Chin;
Or if you were as fair as Hellena was,
I should never more delight therein.
But now my heart it is my own,
why should I for another care?
For to sigh and sob, lament, and moan,
for to ^ing my self unto Despair?
