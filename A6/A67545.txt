Quantities are worth from 3 l. to 4 l. the Pound, we believe the Wrought Silk
may amount to much more in Value than what is above. -- 807250 04 0 11000 Tuns

By the Account above, your Lordships may perceive, that the Linen and Silk
Manufactures only, Imported from France, amount to upwards of Eight Hundred
Thousand Pounds, and the Manufactures of Wool and Silk Exported from England
thither, do not amount to Eighty Five Thousand Pounds. As also all other
Commodities of the Product and Manufacture of England Exported into France, do
not amount to Ninety Thousand Pounds more: Whereas the Wines, Brandies, and
other Commodities of the Product and Manufacture of France Imported into
England, amount to upwards of Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand Pounds; besides
an incredible Value of Toys, rich Apparel, Point-Lace, etc. So that it is
apparent, that the Exports of out Native Commodities and Manufactures to
France, are less in Value by at least One Million of Pounds Sterling, than the
Native Commodities and Manufactures of France, which we receive from thence:
And if it please your Lordships to reflect thereupon, your Lordships will
easily discern the great Prejudice the English Nation has sustained, and the
great Advantage the French have, and do daily make, by holding this Treaty in
Suspense; this Nation being upon the Matter excluded Trade thither, while in
the mean Time the French enjoy all and as great Advantages as they can
reasonably extect by any Treaty.
