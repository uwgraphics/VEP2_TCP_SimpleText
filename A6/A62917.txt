Toney's Soliloquies.
To the Tune of Dagons Fall. Or the Lamentation of a Bad Market.
WHen the Plot I first invented, I was ravished in conceit,
To see its Frame so well cemented, Varnished over with Deceit
It was an infant of my Spirit, Nay, the Darling of my Soul,
If its contrivance be a Merit, By Jove the Cooper did well Boul.
II.
For to give this Engine Motion, To arrive where it did tend,
I filled the Vulgar ears with 'Notions, The Gospel of my Oaten Friend;
I antedated all Transactions, Distinguished Styles to New and Old,
In the State I made such Fractions; Some I Bought, and some I Sold.
III.
The Mobile I so distempered, With the Magic of my Care,
None but would his Soul have ventured, Where brave Tony bore a Share;
Have I not in Abomination Held the Miter and Lawn Sleeves,
And Itcht at a second Sequestration; To pull down such Ghostly Thieves.
IV.
Have I not Taught the Sanhedrim to Imperate and not Obey?
They Had Genuflections done to them, which men to Crowned Heads do pay.
Then would I Barter for repeal of the Five and Thirtieth of Q. Bess,
To make a way for a Commonweal, (the Center of our Happiness.)
V.
How many hot and high Debates, in favor of the Exclusive Bill,
I bandy'd twixt the two Estates, the effects of my depaved will!)
By Subornation to the Block I brought a Loyal Noble Peer;
And trusted others to that Lock, which cost my Block and me so dear.
VI.
In fine, poor prefligated Wretch, for to indulge my Minion Spite,
My Seared Conscience I did stretch, and did Old Rowley's Guards Indict.
I did espouse all Wickedness, and only loved what is purely Evil;
In that alone was my excess; Then take thy own Associate, Devil.
