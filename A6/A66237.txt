to Transport themselves into this Kingdom.
William R.

WHereas it has pleased Almighty God to Deliver Our Realm of England, and the
Subjects thereof, from the Persecution lately threatening them for their
Religion, and from the Oppression and Destruction which the Subversion of their
Laws, and the Arbitrary. Exercise of Power and Dominion over them, had very
near Introduced; We finding in Our Subjects a True and just Sense hereof, and
of the Miseries and Oppressions the French Protestants lie under: For their
Relief, and to Encourage them that shall be willing to Transport themselves,
their Families, and Estates into this Our Kingdom, We do hereby Declare, That
all French Protestants that shall seek their Refuge in, and Transport
themselves into this Our Kingdom, shall not only have Our Royal Protection for
themselves, Families and Estates within this Our Realm; But We will also do Our
Endeavor in all reasonable ways and means, so to Support, Aid, and Assist them
in their several and respective Trades and Ways of Livelihood, as that their
living and being in this Realm may be comfortable and easy to them.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall this Twenty fifth Day of April, 1689. In the
First Year of Our Reign.
