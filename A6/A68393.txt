TO OUR BRETHREN IN ENGLAND, AND ELSE Where Which love Jesus Christ
unfeignedly, mercy, and peace.
IT IS MOre evident and known to all men, the^ well considered and tha^kfully
received of many, with what great mercies, and especial graces god enduede
our country of England in these latter days: when from Ose. 2. d. Romans 9. e.
1. Pet. 2. b.
idolatry he called us to the knowledge of his gospel, and of no people made
us his people, a holy people, the people of god: sendinge us a king most
godly, learned, zealous, wise, and such one as never sat in that royal chair
before: Gods word universally spread over all the land, repentance preached,
Christ's kingdom offered, sin rebuked: so that none could excuse him self,
either that he had not heard, or else was not taught gods holy gospel: yet it
came to pass, and this day, that is verified on us, which the lord reproved
Israel fore, saying, Esa. 65. a. Romans 10. d.
I have stretched forth my hands all the day long, unto a people that
believes not, but rebelleth against me, and walk after their own
ymaginations. For whose ways were not corrupt? eue^ from the Esa. 1. b. 7.
Hier. 2. b.
highest to the lowest, from top to toe, there was no part sownde. Such
contempt of gods word, as well on their behalf to who^ charge of preachinge was
committed, as on the other side, negligence to hear and learn to frame their
lives accordi^ge there unto: that if the lord had not hastened this plague, and
prevented, it would certe^ly have come to pass, which those wicked me^ of
Anathoth said to the prophet Hieremie, Hier. 11. d.
speak no more to us in this name of the lord. The which unkindness and
contempt, would god we could as earnestly repent, as we now feel the lack of
these accustomed mercies for now the day of our Luke. 19. f.
visitation is come, and the lord has brought the Leu. 26. c. Deuteronomy.
27.28.30.7. 1. king. 22. c. 2. Chro. 18. e. Eze. 14. e.
plagues upon us, whereof before we were admoneshed, and most justly menaced.
For the false 7 prophets are sent forth with lies in their mouths to deceive
England, and the scarsetie of gods word is so great that although they seek it

sea coaste to an other, yet they can not find yt, but as men affameshed
devour the pestiferous dounge of papistrie, to the poisoninge of their own
sowles.

Let us therefore brethren Joel. 2. c. Psalm. 68. a. Ion. 3. d. 4. a.
turn wholly to the lord, by repentance, fasting, and prayer, earnestly
besechinge him to receive us once again to his favor, who wills not the
death of a sinner, but his amendment, offeringe him self to all them that in
their necessity seek unto him, and like a most merciful father, proves all
2. Chro. 36. c.
remedies for our betteringe: not cruelly ponishinge to destroy us, but gently
chastisinge to save us.

the crafty dissemblers, which go abowte to measure god by their fantasies: not
consideringe that they Romans 2. a. Iam. 5. a.
heap damnation against them selves in the day of his anger: which now
already is kindled, and begins to flame, to the condemnation of their sowles
and bodies, who knowinge Jesus Christ to have Heb. 9. a. Romans 5, b. 1. Pet. 3.

once fully satisfied for our sins: cease not daily either in heart, mowth, or
owtward consent to blaspheme his precious death, and (asmoche as in them lies
Heb. 6. a. 10. c. 1. Cor. 6. b.
) crucify him a new. Do you not remember that Gal. 5. c. Apo. 21. c. 22. c.
Esa. 66. g. Mark. 9. g.
idolaters have no portion in the ki^gdome of god, but are thrown into the
lake of fire and brymstone, where their worm shall never dye? Can not the
examples of gods fearful 2. Pet. 2. a. b. Jude. a. Job. 4. d.
judgments move you, who spared not his very angels when they trespassed,
but hitherto reserueth them in hell chains, to be tormented in the day of the
lord? and will he then favor idolaters, dissemblers, blasphemers, mockers,
contemners? and not rather in this life verify that which the holy ghost
pronownceth against the children of gods wrath, who becawse they do not receive
the 2. These. 2. c. Ioh. 3. c.
truth for their salvation, are led by lies to their endeles condemnation? at
the least let gods forwarnings some what move you to pity your own state, who
for your instructions, suffers your own brethren emongst you to die so
terribly, some in despair, others to kill them selves, and many vtteringe
most horrible blasphemies even to their last breathe. The which things are so
fearful for us to hear, that we tremble, in thinking there upon. if you will
therefore be counted in the nombre of gods people, and be so in deed, look Luke
9. g. 2. Pet. 2. d. Pro. 26. b. Romans 11. a. 3. king. 19. b 1. Cor. 6. c.
not backwarde from the plough, return not to your vomit, bow not your knee
to Baal, pollut not the temple of the holy ghost, in presentinge your selves
before idols: but either stand in the truth, and so rather Luke 12. a. Act.
5. c.
obey God then man: or else follow gods calling who has so mercifully
provided for you: mouinge the hearts of all godly rulers and magistrates, to
pity your state, and do you good, so that at Emden, Wesell, Franckford, and in
this City he has appointed godly Churches, wherei^ you may learn to fear
him, repent your sins, amend your lives, and recover again his favor and
mercy. And becawse there is no way more ready or sure to come to him, then by
framynge our selves altogether to his blessed 1. Sam. 15. e. Mat. 7. e. Ioh 9.
f.
will, reueiled unto us in his word: we, to whom though God has given more
liberty, yet no less lamentinge your bondage, then reioysinge in our own
deliverance, from that Babylonicall slavery and Antichristian yooke, have
earnestly endeavored emongste other things which might bring us to the worthy
John. 5. g. Luke 1. g. 2. Pet. 1. c.
consideration of gods word, to frame our lives, and refourme our state of
religion in such sort, that neither doubt of the certeintie thereof, should make
us fear, nor yet man's judgment discourage us, and cause us shrincke from this
entreprise: most acceptable to God, comfortable to his church, and
necessarely apparteyning to every christian ma^s duty. We, therefore not as
the greatest clearkes of all, but as the lest able of many, do present unto you
which desire the increase of gods glory, and the pure simplicity of his
word, a form and order of a reformed church, lymited within the compass of
gods word, which our savior has left unto us as only Gal. 1. a. 3. c. 2.
Tim. 3. d. Reave. 22. d.
sufficient to gouuerne all our actions bye: so that what so ever is added to
this word by man's device, seem it never so good, holy, or beautiful, yet
before our God which is ielous and can not admit any co^panyo^ or counselor,
it is evil, wicked, and Luke 16. d.
abominable. For he that is the 1. Cor. 1. d. Ioh. 1. a. 14. a. Hebr. 1. a.
wisdom of the father, the brightenes of his glory, the true light, the
word of life yea truth, and life it self, ca^ he give unto his church (for
the which he paid the raunson of his blood) that which should not be a
sufficient assurance for the same? can the word of truth deceive us? the way
of life misguyde us? the word of salvation damn us God keep us from such
blasphemies, and so direct our hearts with his holy spirit, that we may not
only content our selves with his wisdom, but so rejoice in the same, that we
may abhor all things which are contrary.

The which considerations dear brethren, when we waighed with reverent fear
and hu^blenes: and also knowi^g that negligence in reforming that religion,
which was begone in England, was not the least cause of gods rodds light upon
us, having now obtained by the merciful providence of our heavenly father a
free church for all our nation in this most wourthy City of Geneua, we
presented to the judgment of the famous man John Calvin, and others learned in
these parties the order which we minded to use in our church: who approving
it, as sufficient for a christian congregation, we put the same in execution:
nothing douting but all godly men shall be much edified therbye: and as for
the Papists, or macilious men and ungodly, we have not labored to satisfy
them, becawse we knew no souueraigne medecin for their cankered sore, except
it may please God, by our prayers, to be merciful to the^, and call the^ home,
if They be not already forsaken. But yet for as much as there are su^me,
which through contynuance in their evil ^ather deliting in custom, then
knowlage, can not suffer that men should once open their mouths, against
certain old and received ceremonies, we thought good in this place, some what
to touch that scrupulositie. For as ceremonies grounded upon Gods word and
approuued in the new Testament, are commendable (as the circumstance thereof
does support) so those that man has invented, though he had never so good
occasion thereunto, if they be once abused, import a necessity, hinder gods
word, or be drawn into a superstition, without respect oght to be abolished.
For if 4. king. 18. a.
Ezechias was commended by the holy ghost, for breaking in pieces the brazen
serpent, which Moses had erected by gods commandment, and now had continued
above 800. years, which thing of it self was not evil, but rather put men in
remembrance of gods benefit: yet becawse it began to minister occasion to the
people to co^mitt idolatry was not to be borne withal: how much more oght we
to take heed, that through our occasion men committ not idolatry with their
own imaginations and fantasies? It was not with out great cause commanded by
almyghtye god that the Deu. 12. a. d. 13 c. d. 4. kings. 18. a
places, and other appertinances, which had served to Idolatry should be
utterly consumed, lest babes and children, through occasion remembering the
same, should fall into like inconvenience. And think you that we oght to be
wiser? and not rather take heed, that those things which the papists, and
other idolaters have invented, or else observe as invented by man, may not enter
in to Christ's church as well to the end that the weak may not be 1. Cor. 8.
c. 10 romans 14. c.
confirmed in their error, as that we may altogether 2 Cor. 6. d. Esa. 52. c
separate our selves from that idolatrous Babylon and temple of Belial wherewith
Christ has no concord nor agreement? There was no one ceremony more ancient,
nor yet of better autorite, then the wasshing of the Disciples feet, which was
observed alonge time in the church, and institute by Ioh. 13. a.
Christ him self: yet when some were persuaded, that it was a portion of the
lords supper, and others thought it served in stead of Baptism: the godly
churches in S. Epist. 119. ad Ian.
August. time, thought it better to leave that which was ordained for a good
use, the^ by reteyning the same, confirm an error, or superstition. The
Corinthia^s for the relief of the poor, and to increase brotherly amytie
together did institute 1. Cori. 11. d
a feast immediately Chrisost. in. 11. cap. 1. Cor Tertul. lib. ad vxorem.
after the lords supper: but how sharply S. Paul did reprehe^de the same,
co^demni^g in comparaison, that me^ should add any thing to the lords
institution, it appears by that he says, I have received of the lord, that
which I gave you. We read also that Ezechias and his nepheu Josias 2. Chro
30. a 4. king. 23. e 2. Chro. 30. a
restored the use of the passover, which had been a very long time
disco^tynewed, but in the ministration thereof, they observed no^ other
ceremonies, the^ God had left to Exodus 12. c. Leu. 23. c. Deu. 16. a.
Moses from the beginni^g. Circu^cisio^ likewise a Sacrament, was evermore
after one sort ministered Gene, 17. b. Iosu. 5. b.
even as the lord comanded it. But such is the nature of flesh, it will be
wise, and have astroke in gods doi^ges, yea and how wilfully it causes man to
maynteyne his own pha^tasies, it is manifest to the^, which have perused the
ancient records of the church. For begynni^g at Jerusalem, and so coming
to the rest of the churches as Constantinople, Antioche, Alexandrie, and Rome,
he shall see plainly, that their greatest disturbaunce, and overthrow, chanced
through ceremonies. What conflict was at all times betwixt the Latin and
Greek churches for the same, no Christian can consider without tears. And was
there any thing more objected against. S. Paul both of the Gal. 1.2. Act. 21. d.
Galatia^s, and also of others, then that he would not observe the Ceremonies
as the chief Apostles did? and yet he kept them whiles any hope was to gain
the weak brethren, and therefore circumcised Act. 16. a.
. Timothe: but when he perceived that men would retain the^ as necessary
things in the church, he called that which before he made indifferent, wicked
and impious, sai^g, that Gal. 5. a. Act. 15. a.
who so ever was circumcised Christ could nothing profitt them fearing also,
lest he had taken pains among the^ in Gal. 4. b.
vain, which joined Christ with beggarly ceremonies. Therefore dear brethren,
being hereby persuaded, and with many moo^ reasons confirmed (which
opportunity permits not here to writ) we have contented our selves, with
that wisdom, which we have learned in gods book, where we be taught to Act.
2. g. Matt. 26.28.
preach the word of god purely, minister the Sacraments sincerely, and use
prayers, and other orders thereby approved to the increase of gods glory, and
edification of his holy people. As touching preaching, for as much as it is
allowed of all godly men, we may at this time leave the probation thereof: and
also for the ministration of the two sacraments, our book gives sufficient
proffe. But because prayers are after two manner of sorts, that is, either in
words only, or else with song joined there unto: and this later part, as well
for lack of the true use thereof, as due consideration of the same, is called by
many into dout, whether it may be used in a reformed church: it is expedient,
that we note briefly a few things perteyni^g thereunto. S. Paul giving a rule
how men should singe, first says, I.2. Cor. 14. c.
will singe in voice, and I will sing with understanding: and in an other place
showing what songs should be song, exhorts the Ephesians to Ephesians. 5. d.
Iam. 5. c.
edify one an other with psalms, songs of praise, and such as are
spiritual, singinge in their hearts to the lord with thanks giving. As if
the holy ghost would say, that the song did inflame the heart to call upon
god, and praise him with a more fervent and lively zeal. and as music or
singinge is natural unto us, and therefore every man deliteth therein: so our
merciful god sets before our eyes, how we may rejoice and singe to the
glory of his name, recreation of our spirits, and profit of our selves. But
as there is no gift of god so precious or excellent, that Satan has not after a
sort drawn to him self and corrupt: so has he most impudentlye abused this
notable gift of singinge, chieflye by the papists his ministers in
disfiguring it, partly by strange language, that can not edify: and partly by
a curious wanton sort, hyringe men to tickle the ears, and flatter the
fantasies, not esteminge it as a gift approved by the word of god,
profitable for the church, and confirmed by all antiquity. As, besides other
places, is most manifest by the words of Epist. li. 10.
Plinius, called the younger, who, when he was depute in Asia, unto the
Emperor Traian, and had received charge to enquire out the Christians, to put
them to death, writ emongs other things, touching the Christians, that their
manners were to singe verses, or psalms early in the morninge to Christ their
god. if any paraduenture would doubt, when, or by whom these churches or
assembles were institute, it is likewise evident, that S. Eccle. hist. lib. 3.
cap. 22.
John the Apostle, who, although in Domitia^s time he was banished in the I Will
Pathmos: yet when Nerua his successor, and next before Traian reigned returned
to Ephesus, and so planted the churches, as the stories reaport. Saying
therefore gods word does approve it, antiquity bears witenes thereof, and
best reformed churches have received the same: no man can reprove it, except he
will contemn gods word, despice antiquity, and utterly condemn the godly
reformed churches. And there are no songs more meet, then the psalms of the
Prophet David, which the holy ghost has framed to the same use, and
commended to the church, as conteininge the effect of the whole scriptures,
that hereby our hearts might be more lyuelie touched, as appears by Exo. 25.
a. Esa. 38. c. Iud. 16. a. Iug. 5. a. Luk, 1. f. Luke 1. c.
Moses, Ezechias, Judith, Debora, Marie, Zachary and others, who by songs and
meter, rather then in their common speech, and prose, gave thanks to god,
for such comfort as he sent them. Here it were to long to entreat of the
meter. but for as much as the learned dout not thereof. and it is plainly prouen
that the psalms are not only meter, and co^teyne just Cesures: but also have
grace and majesty in the verse more then any other places of the scriptures,
Read Moses Chabib in his books called, (...)
we need not to enter into any probation. For they that are skillful in the
hebrewe tongue by comparinge the psalms with the rest of the scriptures
easelie may perceive the meter. and to whom is it not known, how the holy
ghost by all means soght to help our memory, when he facioned many psalms
accordi^ge to the lettres of the Alphabet: so that every verse begi^neth with
the lettres thereof in order? sometimes. A. begins the half verse. and. B.
the other half, and in an other place three verses, yea and eight verses with
one lettre, even the psalm throughout: as if all men should be inflamed with
the love thereof, both for variety of matter, and also briefenes, easines, and
delectation. Now to make you privy also, why we altered the ryme in certain
places, of him whom for the gifts that God had geuyn him we esteemed and
reverenced, this may suffice: that in this our e^treprise, we did only set God
before our eyes and therefore wayed the words and sense of the Prophet: rather
co^sideringe the meaning thereof, then what any man had wrytt. and chiefly
being in this place where as most perfect and godly judgment did assure us,
and exhortatio^s to the same encorage us, we thought it better to frame the ryme
to the Hebrewe sense, the^ to bind that sense to the English meter. and so
either altered for the better in such places as he had not attained unto, or
else where he had escaped part of the verse, or some times the whole, we added
the same: not as men desirous to find fautes, but only as such which couuete
to hyde them, as the learned can judge. It remains last of all that you
understand the reasons which mouede us to choose owte and follow this
Catechism of Geneua rather then any other for consyderinge that the true use
of a Catechism is to instruct a christian fully in all points of belief, and
christian religion, and wherein this is most easily, order, ly, and perfitely
taught, that to be the best: we could find none in so great a nombre which
either for the facility is equal, or else for the perfection to be compared.
Moreover the dangers which hang over Christ's Church in these dais moved us
very much: for as men may see present signs of certain barbarousnes, and
puddells of errors which are like to chance in the chur, che of god: so there
is no better preservation against the same, then if all godly churches would
agree in one kind of doctrine and confession of faith, which in all points were
agreeable to gods holy word: 48. Psalm. 89. a.
that our posterity might be confirmed, by the universal example of Christ's
Church against all heresies, persecutions and other dangers: perceuinge that
it is not only the doctrine of one man, but the consent of the whole christian
church, and that wherein all yowthe has been brought up and trained in. The
which thing saying none has so far performed, nor yet is in such towardnes
to the same as this Catechism is, being for the worthiness thereof already
translated into Hebrew, Greek, Latin, french, Italian, Spaynishe, Dutch, and
English, we cowld do no less, but willingly and gladly embrase the same.
Wherefore we being now under the same cross of affliction that you owr dear
brethern are, and yet altogether the children of God our merciful father
through Jesus Christ, desir you, in his name, with judgment to read our
doings, tryinge them only by the towchestone of his word, that either if
they be found fawtie, they may be rejected, or else if they be profitable, god
may be glorifyede, his church edifyed, and the malicious confounded. Fare well
dear brethren, and let us all pray to our louinge god, that he would be
merciful unto us, restore his holy word, comfort and strengthen his
children, and finally confound Satan, Antichrist, and all his enymies. At

sacrements, to wit, of Baptism, and the Lords Supper: which sacraments
Christ has left unto us, as holy signs, and seals of Gods promesses. For
as by Baptism, once received, is signified that we (as well infants, as others

strangers from God, by original sin, are received into his family and

our bodies, but also spiritually nurisheth our souls, with the Ioh. 6. d.
graces and benefits of Jesus Christ (which the scripture calls eatinge of
his flesh, and drinkinge of his blood) nether must we in the administration of
these sacraments, follow ma^s pha^tasie, but as Christ him self has
ordained, so must they be ministered: and by such as Heb. 5. b. Ioh. 3. d.
by ordinary vocation are thereunto called. Therefore whosoever reserueth and
worshippeth these sacraments, or contrariwyse contemns them in time and

OF THE MINIsters and their election. What things are chiefly required in the
pastors and ministers.
FIRST let the Act. 1. d. and 13. a. 14. f.
church diligently consider that the minister which is to be chosen, be not
found 1. Timo. 3. a. 2. Tim. 2. b. 4. a. Eze.. 33. a. Iere. 3. d. Ioh. 21. c.
Isa. 62. c 1. cor. 9. d.
culpable of any such fautes, which saint Paul reprehendeth in a man of that
vocation: but contrariwise endewed with such virtues, that he may be able to
undertake his charge, and diligently execute the same. Secondely that he 2.
Tim. 2. e. 2. peter. 4. e. Matt. 26. c. 28. d. 1. Cor. 1. c.
distribute faithfully the word of God, and minister the sacraments sincerely,
ever Act. 20. d. 2. Tim. 4. a.
careful not only to teach his flock publikly, but also privately to
admonisshe them: remembering alwais that if any thing Eze. 3. d. 2. 1. Cor. 9.
c.
perysshe through his defaute, the lord will require it at his hands.

OF THEIR OFfice and deutie.
BECAWSE the charge of the word of God is of greater 1. Cor. 9. c. Act 6. a.
luk 12. c.
importance, then that any man is able to dispe^ce therewith, and saint Paul
exhorts to 1. Cor. 4. a. 2. Cor. 4. b.
esteem them, as ministers of Christ, and disposers of gods mysteries: not 1.
peter. 3. a. 2. cor. 1. d. Matt. 20. d.
lords or rulers, as S. Peter says, over the flock. Therefore the Pastors or
ministers chief office stands in Matt. 26. c. 28. d. Mala. 2. a. 1. peter. 4.
c. act. 3. c. and 16. ^ 1. cor. 1. d. 15. a
preaching the word of God, and ministering the sacraments. So that in
consultations, judgments, elections and other political affairs, his Act.
20. e. f. 2. cor. 4. b.
counsel, rather then autorite, takes place. And if so be the congregation
upon just cawse, agrees to excommunicate, the^ it belongs to the minister,
according to their 1. cor. 5. b.
general determination, to pronounce the sentence, to the end that all things
may be done 1. cor. 14. g.
orderly, and without confusion.

THE manner of electinge the pastors or ministers.
THE ministers and elders at such time as there wants a minister, Act. 14.
d. Tit. 1. b. Act. 1. d.
assemble the whole congregation, exhortinge them to advise and consider who
may best serve in that rowme, and office. And if there be choice, the church
appoynte two or three, upon sum certain day to be examined by the ministers
and elders. First as towchyng their 1. Tim. 3. a. Tit. 1. b.
doctrine, whether he that should be minister have good and sownde knowlage in
the holy scriptures, and fit and apt gifts to communicate the same to the
edification of the people. For the trial whereof, they propose him a theme, or
text to be treated privately, whereby his ability may the more manifestly
appear unto the^. Secondly they enquire, of his life, and conversation, if he
have in times past lived without slander: and governed him self insuche sort
as the word of god has not Romans 2. d. Iam. 1. d.. Sam. 2. ^. T. im. 5. d.
heard euel, or been slandered through his occasion, which being severally
done, they signify unto the congregation, whose gifts they find most
excellent, and profitable for that ministry. Appoynting by a general consent
eight days at the least, that every man may diligently inquire of his life
and manners. At the which time also, the minister exhorts them to humble them
selves to God, by Act. 13. a. and 14. d. luc 2. e.
fasting, and prayer, that both their election may be agreeable to his will,
and also profitable to the church. And if in the mean season, any thing be
brought against him, whereby he may be fownde unworthy by lawful probations,
then is he dismissed, and some other presented. If nothing be alleged, upon
some certain day, one of the ministers at the morning sermon presents him
again to the church: framyng his sermon, or some part thereof, to the setting
forth of his dewtie. Then at after none, the sermon ended, the minister
exhortith them to the election, with the 1. Cor. 10. g. Col. 3. c. Matt. 9. d.
invocation of Gods name: directing his prayer, as God shall move his heart. In
like manner after the election, the minister gives 1. These. 5. c. Col. 4. a.
Ephe. 5. d. philip. 1. c.
thanks to God with request of such things as shall be necessary for his
office. After that he is appointed minister, the people sing a Psalm and
depart.

Of the Elders and as touching their office, and election.
THE Nom. 11. c. Act. 14. d. 16. a. 20. d. romans 12. b. Ephe. 4 c. 1. Cor. 12.
d. Iam. 5. c. 1. peter. 5. a.
Elders must be men of good life, and godly conversation, without blame and
all suspision, careful for the flock, wise and above all things, fearing
God. Whose office stands in governing with the rest of the ministers, in
consulting, admonisshing, correcting, and ordering all things, appertayning to
the state of the congregation. And they differ from the ministers in that they
preach not the word, nor minister the sacraments. In assemblyng the people,
nether they, without the ministers, nor the ministers without them may
attempt any thing. And if any of the just no^bre want, the minister by the
consent of the rest, warns the people thereof, and finalye admonissheth them
to observe the same order, which was used in chosing the ministers.

Of the deacons and their office and election.
THE Act. 6. a. 1. Tim. 3. b.
deacons must be men of good estimation, and report, discret, of good
conscience, charitable, wise, and finallye adorned with such virtues, as S.
Paul requires in them. Their office is, to gather the aulmes dilige^tlie, and
faithfully to romans 12. b.
distribute it, with the consent of the ministers, and elders. Also to provide
for the sick, and impotent persons. Having ever a diligent care, that the
charity of godly men, be not wasted 2 Thessalonians. 3. b.
upon loytrers, and idle vagabo^des. Their election is, as has been before
rehearsed in the ministers and Elders.

WE are not ignorante that the scriptures make mention of a fourth kind of
ministers, left to the church of Christ. which also are very profitable,
where time and place does permit. But for lack of opportunity, in this our
dispersion and exile, we can not well have the use thereof: and would to God it
were not neglected where better occasion serves. These ministers are called,
teachers or doctors. Ephe. 4. c. 1 Cor. 12. d.
whose office is to instruct, and teach the faithful in sownde doctrine,
providing with all diligence, that the purity of the gospel be not corrupt
either through ignorance, or evil opinions. Notwithstanding, considering the
present state of things, we comprehend under this title, such means, as God
has in his church that it should not be left desolate, nor yet his doctrine
decay, for defaut of ministers thereof. Therefore to term it by a word more
usual in these our days, we may call it thorder of schools, wherein the
highest degree and most annexed to the ministry and government of the
church, is the exposition of Gods word, which is contained in tholde and
new testamentes. But becawse men can not so well proffet in that knowledge,
except they be first instructed in the tongues and human sciences (for now God
works not commonly by miracles) it is necessary that seed be sown for the
time to come, to the intent that the church be not left barren, and waste, to
our posterity: and that schools also be erected, and colleges mayntayned,
with just and sufficient stipendes, wherein youth may be trained in the
knowledge and fear of God: that in their ripe age, they may prove worthy
members of our lord Jesus Christ, whether it be to rule in civil policy, or
to serve in the spiritual ministry, or else to live in godly reverence and
subjection.

THE CONSISTORY. THE WEEKLY ASsemble of the ministers.
TO the intent, that the ministry of Gods word, may be had in reverence,
and not brought to contempt, through the evil Roma. 2. d Ezech. 36. e. Isa.
52. b
conversation of such, as are called thereunto: and also that fautes and vices,
may not by long sufferance 2. Timo. 2. e.
grow at length to extreme inconveniences: It is ordained that every
thursdaye, the ministers, and elders, in their assembly or Consistory
diligently 1. Cor. 5. b
examine all such fautes and suspicions, as may be espied, not only amongst
others, but chiefly amongst them selves, lest they seem to be culpable, of
that which our savior Christ Math. 7. a. Luk 6. f. Romans 2. c.
reproved, in the pharisees, who could epsy a mote in an other man's eye, and
could not see a beam in their own. And becawse the Math. 6. c. Luk 11. e.
eye ought to be more clear, then the rest of the body, the minister may not
be spotted with any vice, but to the great slander of Gods word, whose
message he bears. Therefore it is to be understand that therbe certain
fautes, which if they be deprehended in a minister, he oght to be deposed: as
heresy, papistrie, schism, blasphemy, perjury, fornication, theft,
dronke^nes, usury, fighting, unlawful games, with such like. Others are more
tolerable, if so be, that after brotherly admonition, he amendith his faut:
as strange and unprofitable fashon in preaching the scriptures, curiosity in
sekyng vain questions, negligence, as well in his sermons, and in studying the
scriptures, as in all other things concerning his vocation, scurrilitie,
flattering, lying, backbyting, wanton words, deceit, covetousness, tauntyng,
dissolutio^ in apparel, gesture and other his doings, which vices, as they be
odious in all men, so in him that ought to be as an Matt. 5. b. Mar. 9. g.
example to others of perfection, in no wise are to be suffered: especially, if
so be that according to Gods Matt. 18. b. luke 17. a. Iam. 5. d.
rule being brotherly advertised, he acknowledge not his faut and amend.

INTERPRETATIon of the scriptures.
EVERY week once, the congregation assemble to hear some place of the
scriptures orderly 1. Cor. 14. a. 1. These. 5. d. Ephe. 4. b. ^. cor. 11. d.
expounded. At which time, it is lawful for every man to speak, or enquire as
God shall move his heart, and the text minister occasion, so it be without
pertinacitee or disdain, as one that rather seeks to proffit then to contend.
And if so be any contencion rise, then such as are appointed moderatours,
either satisfy the party, or else if he seem to cavil, exhort him to keep
silence, referring the judgment thereof to the ministers, and elders, to be
determined in their assembly or consistory before mentioned.

THE PRAYERS.
When the congregation is assembled, at the hour appointed, the minister uses
one of these two confessions, or like in effect: exhorting the people
diligently, to examine the^ selves, following in their hearts the tenor of his
words.

For they which once were well instructed in the doctrine of thy gospel, are
now 2. pet. 2. d. prou. 26. b. Hebr, 6, a. 10. e.
gone back from the obedience of thy truth, and are turned again to that

AN OTHER CONfession for all states and times.
O Eternal God and most merciful father, we confess, and acknowlage, here

displeased with our selves for the sins, that we have committed against thee,
and do unfeignedly repent us of the same: we most humbly beseech thee, for
Jesus Christ's sake, to show thy mercy upon us, to forgive us all our sins,
and to increase thy holy spirit in us: that we Col. 3. a. Romans 6. a. Ephe. 4.

acknowlaginge, from the botome of our hearts, our own unrighteous, may
from hensforth, not only mortify our sinful lusts and affections, but also
bring forth such fruits, as may be agreeable to thy most blessed will, not
for the worthynes thereof, but for the Romans 5. a Hebr. 9. d. Ephesians. 2. d.
merits of thy dearly beloved son Jesus Christ our only savior, whom
thou have already given an oblation and offeringe for our sins: and for whose
Ioh. 14. b. 16. c Math. 7. b. Iam. 1. a.
sake, we are certainly persuaded, that thou wylt deny us nothing, that we
shall ask in his name, according to thy will. For thy Io. 3. d. To. 8. b. c. g.
spirit does assure our consciences, that thou art our merciful father, and
so love us thy childrene through him, that nothing is able to remove thy
heavenly grace, and favor, from us: to thee therefore o father, with the son
and the holy ghost, be all honor, and glory, world with out end. So be it.

This done, the people singe a Psalm all together, in a plain tune, which
ended, the minister prays for thassistance of Gods holy spirit as the same
shall move his heart, and so proceeds to the sermon, Vsinge after the sermon
this prayer followinge or such like.

IT shall not be necessary for the minister daily to repete all these things

mentioned, or else prays, as the spirit of God shall move his heart: framinge

shall be convenient, that the minister at such time, do not only admonyshe the
people thereof, but also use some form of prayer, according as the present
necessity requires, to the which he may appoint, by a common consent, some
several day after the sermon wekely to be observed.

that women should preach or minister the Sacraments: and it is evident, that
the sacraments are not ordained of God to be used in private corners, as
charms or sorceries, but left to the congregation, and necessarely annexed to
Gods word, as seals of the same: therefore the enfant, which is to be
baptized, shall be brought to the church on the day appointed to comen prayer and
preachinge, accompanied with the father and god father. So that after the
Sermon, the child being presented to the minister, he demands this question.

DO you present this child to be baptized, earnestly desiring that he may be
ingrafted in the mystical body of Jesus Christ?

The answer

Yea, we require the same.

The minister proceeds

THEN let us consider (dearly beloved) how almyghtie God has not only made us
his children by romans 8. c. Gal. 4. a. Ephe. 1. a. 2. c.
adoption and received us into the fellowship of his church: but also has
promised that he will be our Genesis 17. a. Exodus 20. a. Deu. 7. b. Esa. 59. d
God, and the God of our children unto the thousand generation. Which thing as
he confirmed to his people of the old testament by the sacrament of Genesis 17.
b. Romans 4. b.
circumcision, so has he also renewed the same to us, in his new testament by
the sacrament of Col. 2. e Gal. 3. d Act. 2. f
baptism, doing us thereby to wit, that our infantes apperteyne to him by
covenant and therefore oght not to be defrauded of those holy signs and badges
Act. 10. g
where by his children are known from infidells and pagans. Neither is it
requisite, that all those that receive this sacrament, have the use of
understanding and fay the, but chiefelye that they be contained under the name
of Act. 2. 2. Cor. 7. c.
gods people: So that remission of sins in the blood of Christ Jesus, does
appertain to the^ by Gods promise. Which thing is most evident by 1. Cor. 7. c
saint Paul, who pronounces the children begotten and borne either of the
parents being faithful, to be clean and holy. Also our savior Christ
admits Mar. 10. b. mat. 19. b. luke 18. c. psalm. 22. d
children to his presence, imbrasing and blessinge them. Which testimonies of
the holy ghost assure us, that infants be of the number of Gods people: and
that remission of sins does also apperteyne, to them in Christ. Therefore
without injury they can not be debarred from the common sign of Gods
children. Neither yet is this owteward action of such necessity, that the
romans 4. b. Gal. 3. a. Iam. 2. d. Genesis 15. b. 17. b
lack thereof, should be prejudicial to their salvation, if that prevented by
death, they may not conveniently be presented to the church. But we (having
respect to that obedience which christians owe to the voice and ordinance of
Christ Jesus, who commanded Mark. 10. b. Matt. 28. d.
to preach and baptize all, with out exception) do judge them only unworthy
of any fellowship with him, who contemptuosly refuse such ordinary means, as
his wisdom has appointed to the instruction of our dull senses. Furthermore
it is evident that baptism was ordained, to be ministered in the element of
matt. 3. c. 1. Peter. 3. d. 1. Ioh. 5. b..Cor. 10. a.
water, to teach us, that like as water outwardly does wash a way the fylthe
of the body, so inwardly does the virtue of Christ's blood purge our sowles
from that corruption and deadly poison wherewith by Ephe. 2. a.
nature we were infected. Whose venomous romans 7
dreggs, although they continewe in this our flesh, yet by the merits of his
death, are not romans 4. a. Gal. 3. a. psalm. 32. a.

ours by baptism. Not that we think any such virtue or power, to be included
in the visible water or owtward action (for many have been baptized and yet
never inwardly purged) but that our savior Christ, who commanded baptism to
be ministered, will by the power of his holy spirit, effectually work in the
hearts of his Act. 2. g. 13. g.

that is to say, a resisting of the rebellious lusts of the flesche: The fruit
of baptism stands in two points mortificatio^, and regeneration.
and in newnes of lyffe, whereby we continually strive to walk in that pureness,
and perfection, wherwyth we are cladd in baptism. And although we in the
journey of this lyffe be 1. peter. 5. b. Luk 22. d. Job. 7.
encumbered with many ennemies, which in the way assail us: yet fight we not
with out fruit: For this Romans 5. a. 1. Peter. 1. a. Iam. 1. a. Ephe. 6. b.
continual battaill which we fight against sin, death, and hell, is a most
infallible argument, that God the father, mi^dfull of his promise made unto us
in Christ Jesus, does not only give us motions and courage to resist them: but
also assurance to 1. Cor. 15. g Osee 13. d. Heb. 2. d. Job. 16. d.
overcome, and obtain victory. Wherefore (dearly beloved) it is not only of
necessity that we be once baptized, but also it much profits often to be
present at the ministration thereof: that we being putt in mind of the Deuteronomy.

contrariwise have strayed from hi^ through Ephe. 4. e Col 3. b. Heb. 2. b.

Then the father or in his absence, the God father shall rehearse the articles

in this manner or such like kneeling.

child's name which known

He says.

N. Matt. 28. d. Mark. 16. c. Act. 2. f.
I baptize thee in the name of the father, of the son, and of the holy ghost.

And as he speaks these words, he takes water in his hand and lays it
upon the childs forehead. which done he gives thanckes, as follows

FOR asmoche most holy, and merciful father, as thou do not only beawtifie

for Christ's sake we beseech thee, that thou will confirm this thy favor more
and more toward us, and take this infant into thy tuition and defense, whom we
offer and present unto thee with common supplications, and never suffer him to
fall to such vnkindes, whereby he should 2. Cor. 6. d.
lose the force of this baptism, but that he may perceive thee continually to
be his merciful father, through thy holy spirit, working in his heart: by whose
divine power, he may so prevail against Satan, that in the end, obteyning the
victory, he may be exalted into the liberty of thy kingdom.

THE MANNER OF THE LORDS SVPPER.
THE day when the lords supper is ministered which commo^lye is used once a
monthe, or so often as the Congregation shall think expedient, the minister
uses to say as follows.

LET us mark dear brethren, and consider how Jesus Christ did ordain unto
us his holy supper according as S. Paul makes rehearsal in the 11. chap. of
the first Epistle to the Cor. I have (says he) received of the lord that
which I have delivered unto you, to wit, that the lord Jesus the same night
he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it
saying. Take ye, eat ye, this is my body, which is broken for you: do you
this in remembrance of me. Likewise after supper, he took the cup, sayi^ge.
This cup is the new testament or covenant in my blood, do ye this so often
as ye shall drink thereof, in remembrance of me. For so often as you shall eat
this bread, and drink of this cup, ye shall declare the lords death until
his coming. Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink the cup of
the lord unworthily, he shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord. Then
see that every man prove and try him self, and so let him eat of this bread
and dri^ke of this cup, for whosoever eats or drinks unworthily, he
eats and drinks his own damnation, for not having due regard and
consideration of the lords body.

THIS done, the minister proceadith to the exhortation.

DEARLY beloved in the lord, forasmoch as we be now assembled, to celebrate
the holy communion of the body and blood of our savior Christ, let us consider
these words of S. Paul, how he exhorts all persons diligently to try and
examine the^ selves, before they presume to eat of that bread, and drink of
that cup. For as the benefit is great, if with a truly penitent heart, and
lively faith, we receive that holy sacrament (for then we Ioh. 6. g.
spiritually eat the flesh of Christ, and drink his blood, the^ we dwell in
Christ, and Christ in us, we be one with Christ, and Christ with us) so is the
danger great, if we receive the same unworthily, for then we be guilty of the
body, and blood of Christ our savior, we eat and dri^ke our own damnation,
not considering the lords body: we ki^dle gods wrath against us, and provoke
him to plague us with diverse diseases and sundry kinds of death. Therefore if
any of you be Gal. 3. d.
a blasphemer of God, an hinderer or slaunderer of his word, an an adulterer,
or be in malice or envy, or in any other grievous crime, bewaylle your sins,
and come not to this holy table: lest after the taking of this holy sacrament,
the devil enter into you as he entered into Joan. 13. ^.
Judas, and fill you full of all iniquities, and bring you, to destruction,
both of body and soul. Judge therefore your selves brethren, that ye be not
judged of the lord: Matthew. ^. c. Titus 2. c.
repent you truly for your sins paste, and have a lively and steadfast faith,
in Christ our savior, Act. 4. c Gal. 2. d
sekinge only your salvation in the merits of his death, and passion, from
hensforth refusinge, and forgettinge all 1. pet. 2. a. 1. Cor. 14. d ephe. 4.
a. d
malice and debate, withfull purpose to live in brotherly amytie, and godly
conversation, all the dais of your life. And albeit we feel in ourselves much
frailty and wretchedness, as that we have not our faith so perfect, and
constant, as we ought, being many times ready to distruste Gods goodness
through our corrupt romans 7. d.
nature, and also that we are not so throughlye given to serve God, neither
have so fervent a zeal to set forth his glory, as our duetye requires,
felinge still such rebellion in our selves, that we have need daily to Gala. 5.
c
fight against the lusts of our flesh, yet nevertheless saying that our lord
has dealed thus mercifully with us, that he has printed his Hebr. 8. d Iere.
31. f. Isa. 59. d
gospel in our hearts, so that, we are preserved from falling into desperatio^
and misbeliefe: and seeing also he has endued us with a Romans 7. c. d phil. 1.
a. 2. Cor.
will, and desire to renownce and withstand our own affections, with a longing
for his righteousenes and the keeping of his commandments, we may be now
right well assured, that those defautes and manifold imperfections in us,
shall be no hinderance at all against us, to cause him not to accept and impute
us as worthy to come to his spiritual table, For the end of our coming
thither, is not to make luke 18. c.
protestation, that we are upright or just in our lives, but contrariwise, we
come to seek our life and perfection, in Jesus Christ, acknowledging in the
mean time, that we of our selves, be the children Ephesians. 2. a. luk 18. c.
of wrath, and damnation. Let us consider then, that this sacrament is a
singular medicine for all poor sick creatures, a comfortable help to weak
souls, and that our lord requires no other worthiness on our part, but that
we unfeignedly acknowledge our noghtines, and imperfection. Then to the end that
we may be worthy partakers of his merits, and most comfortable benefits
(which Joan. 6. f.
is the true eatinge of his flesh, and drinkinge of his blood) let us not
suffer our minds to wander about the consideration of these earthly, and
corruptible things (which we see present to our eyes and feel with our hands)
to seek Christ bodily present in the^, as if he were enclosed in the bread
or wine, Transsubstantiation, Transeleme^tatio^, Transmutation and
Transformation as the papists use them are the doctrine of devils
or as if these elements were turned and changed into the substance, of his
flesh and blood. For the only way to dispose our souls to receive
norishment, relief, and quikening of his substance, is to lift up our minds
by faith above all things wordlye and sensible, and thereby to enter into
heaven, The true eating of Christ in the sacrament
that we may find, and receive Christ, where he 1. Timo. 6. d
dwells undoubtedly very God, and very man, in the incomprehensible glory
of his father, to whom be all praise, honor and glory now and ever. Amen.

The exhortation ended, the minister comes down from the pulpet, and sits
at the Table, every man and woman in likewise taking their place as occasion
best serves, Math. 26. c. Mark. 14. c Luke 22. b 1. Cor. 11. e

according to our savior Christ's commandment, and in likewise gives the
cup. Duringe the which time, 1. Cor. 11. e John. 13.14
some place of the scriptures is read, which does lively set forth the death of
Christ, to the intene that our eyes and senses may not only be occupiede in
these outward signs of bread and wine, which are called the visible word:
but that our hearts and minds also may be fully fixed in the contemplation of
the lords death, which is by this holy sacrament representede. And after the
action is done, he gives thanckes saing.

MOST merciful father, we render to the all praise thanks and glory, for
that thou have vouchsafed to grant unto us miserable sinners so excellent a
gift and threasor, as to receive us into the 1. Cor. 10. d
fellowship and company of thy dear son Jesus Christ our lord, whom thou

heavenly father) to grant us this request, that thou never suffer us to become

The action thus ended, the people singe the 103 psalm. My soul give laud etc.

mencionede is recitede, and so they rise from the table and depart.

To the reader.
IF parchaunce any would marvel why we follow rather this order, then any
other in the administration of this sacrament, let him diligently consider,
that first of all we utterly renownce the error of the papists: secondly we
restore unto the sacraments their own substance: and to Christ his proper
place. And as for the words of the lords supper we rehearce them not bicawse
they should change the substance of the bread or wine, or that the repeticion
thereof with the intent of the sacrificer should make the sacrament as the
papists falselie, believe: but they are read and pronownced to teach us how to
behave our selves in this actio^ and that Christ might witness unto owr faith
as it were with his own mowthe, that he has ordained these signs for our
spiritual use and comfort. we do first therefore examyne owr selves,
according to saint Paul's rule, and prepare our minds that we may be worthy
partakers of so high mysteries. Then taking bread, we give thanks, break,
and distribute it, Mat. 76. c. 1. Cor. 11. c luk 22. b.
as Christ our savior has taught us. Finally the ministration ended, we give
thanks again according to his example. So that without his word, and
warrante, there is nothing in this holy action attempted.

THE FORM of Marriage.
AFter the banes or contracte has been publisshed three several days in the
congregation (to the intent that if any person have intereste or title to
either of the parties, they may have sufficient time to make their challenge)
the parties assemble at the beginning of the sermon and the minister at time
convenient, says as follows,

Of Marriage. The exhortation.
DEARLY beloved brethren, we are here gathered together in the sight of God,
and in the face of his congregation, to knytt and join these parties together
in the Heb. 13.2.
honorable estate of matrimony, which was instituted and auctorised by God him
selff in Gene. 2. d. Pro. 18. d.
paradise, man being then in the state of innocence. For what time God made
heaven and earth, and all that is in them, and had created and fasshoned man
also after his own similitude and likeness, unto whom he gave rule and
lordship over all the beasts of the earth, fisshes of the sea, and fowls of
the air: he said it is not good that man live alone, let us make him an helper
like unto him selff. And God brought a fast sleep upon him, and took one of
his ribs, and shaped Eua thereof, doing us thereby to understand that, In
hebrewe man is called Isch, and the woman Ischa whereby is well expressed the
natural affinity betwixt man and his wife
man and wife, are one boddy, one flesh, and one blood. Signifyinge also unto
us the Ephe. 5. g.
mystical union, that is betwixt Christ and his church, for the which cawse
man Genesis 2. d. Mat. 19. a. Mark. 10. a. 2. Cor. 6. d.
leaves his father and mother, and takes him to his wife, to keep company
with her, the which also he ough to love, eue^ as owr savior loves his
church, that is to say his John. 17. b. Romans 5. a. Hebr. 9. d. 1. peter 3. d.

semblably also it is the Ephe. 5. e. Col. 3. c. 1. peter. 3. a. 1. Cor. 11. a.

things that be godly and honest, for she is in subjection, and under the
governance of her howsbande, so long as they contynew both Romans 7. a 1. Cor.
7. g. Matt. 19. ^.

virtue and force, that thereby the howsband has no more 1. Cor. 7. a. 1.

right or power over his own body, but the wife, and likewise the wife has
no power, over her own body, but the housband, forasmoche as God has so knytt
them together in this mutual society to the procreation of children, that
they should Ephe. 6. a 1. Tim. 2. d.
bring them up in the fear of the lord, and to the increase of Christ's
kingdom. Wherefore they that be thus couppled together by God, can not be
severed, or put a part, oneles it be for a season with thassent of 1. Cor. 7.
a.
both parties, to the^d to give them selves the more fervently to fasting
and prayer, gyuyng diligent head in the mean time that their long being
aparte, be not a snare to bring the^ into the danger of Satan through
incontinencie, and therefore to avoid fornication, every man ought to have his
own wyffe, and every woman her own howsband, so that, so many as can not live
chaste, are Matt. 19. b. 1. Cor. 7. b.
bownde by the commandment of God to mary, that there by, the holy 1. Cor. 3.
c. and 6. d. 2. Cor. 6. d. leu. 26. b. 1. peter. 1. d.
temple of God, which is our bodies, may be kept pure and undefiled: for since
owr bodies are now be come the very members of Jesus Christ, how horrible,
and detestable a thing is it, to make them the members of an harlot? Every one

pureness, and holiness, for whosoever 1. Cor. 3. d.
polluteth and defiles the temple of God, him will God destroy.

Here the minister speakethe to the parties that shall be mariede in this wise.

I Require and charge you, as you will answar at the day of Judgment, when
the 1. Cor. 4. a. Matt. 7. a romans 2. a.
secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that if either of you do know any
impediment, why ye may not be lawfully joined to gether in matrimony, that ye
confess it, for be ye well assured that so many as be coupled otherwise then
gods word does allow, are not joined together by God, neither is their
matrimony lawful.

If no impediment be known then the minister says.

I take you to wittenes that be here present, besechyng you all to have good
remembrance hereof, and moreover if there be any of you, which knows that
either of these parties he contracted to any other, or knows any other
lawful impediment, let them now make declaration thereof.

If no cawse be alleged the Minister procedith saying.

FORASMVCHE as no man speaks against this thing, you. N. shall proteste
here before God, and his holy congregation, that you have takyn, and are now
contented to have. N. here present for your laufull wife, and spowse, promisyng
to keep her, to love and entreat her in all things according to the Col. 3.
d. 1. peter. 3. b. Matt. 19. c. 1. Cor. 7. b. Mala. 2. d.
dewtie of a faithful howsband, forsakyng all other during her life, and
briefly to live in a holy conversation with her keeping faith and trewthe in
all points, according as the word of God, and his holy gospel does
commawnde.

THE ANSWER.

EVEN so I take her before God and in presence of this his congregation.

THE minister to the spowse also says.

YOU. N. shall proteste here before the face of God, in the presence of this
holy congregation, that ye have takyn and are now contented to have. N. here
present for your lawful howsband, promisynge to him 1. Cor. 11. a. Ephe. 5. c.
Col. 3. c. 1. Tim. 2. d. 1. peter. 3. a Ester 1. d.
subjection, and obedience, forsakyng all other during his life, and finally
to live in a holy conversation with him kepinge faith and truethe in all
points as Gods word does prescribe.

THE ANSWER.

EVEN so I take him before God and in the presence of this his congregation.

Give diligent ear to the gospel that ye may understand how owr lord would
have this holy contracte kept and observed, and how sure and fast a knott it
is, which may in no wise be lowsed according as we be taught in the 19 chap.
of S. Mathewes gospel.

THE pharisees came unto Christ to te^pte him and to grope his mind, saying,
Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every light cawse? he
answered saying, have ye not read that he which created man at the beginning,
made them male and female? saying, for this thing shall man leave father and
mother, and cleave unto his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, so that
they are no more two, but are one flesh. Let no man therefore put a sonder,
that which God has cowpled togethers.

IF ye believe assueredlie these words which owr lord and savior did speak
(according as ye have hard them now rehearsed owte of the holy gospel) then
may you be certain, that God has even so knytt you together in this holy
state of wedlock. Wherefore apply your selves, to live a chaste and holy life
together, in godly love, in christian peace, and good example, ever holdinge
fast, the band of charity withowte any breach, kepinge faith and truth,
the one to the other even as gods word does appoynte.

Then the minister commends them to God in this or such like sort.

THE lord sanctify and bless you, the lord power the riches of his grace
upon you, that ye may please him, and live together in holy love to your
lives end, So be it.

Then is song the 128. Psalm. Blessed are they that fear the lord, etc. or
some other appertaynyng to the same purpose.

The visitation of the sick.
BEcawse the visitation of the sick, is a thing very necessary, and yet not
withstandyng, it is hard to prescribe all rules appertaynyng thereunto, we
refer it to the discretion of the godly and prudent minister, who according
as he seethe the pacient affected, either may lift him up with the sweet
promesses of gods mercy through Christ, if he perceive him much afraid of
gods thretenynges, or contrary wise, if he be not towched with the felinge of
his sins, may beat him down with gods justice. Evermore like a skillful
physician, framyng his medicine according as the disease requires, and if he
perceive him to want any necessaries, he not only releueth him according to
his ability, but also provides by others that he may be furnissed
sufficiently. Moreover the party that is visited, may at all times for his
comfort, send for the minister: who does not only make prayers for him
there presently, but also if it so require commends him in the public
prayers to the congregation.

Of Burial.
THE corpse is reverently brought to the grave, accompagnied with the
congregation, with owte any further ceremonies, which being buriede, the
minister goes to the church, if it be not far of, and makes some
comfortable exhortacion to the people, towchyng death, and resurrection.

THE ORDER of the ecclesiastical discipline.
AS no City, Town, house, or family, can maynteine their estate and
prospere, The necessity of discipline.
without policy and governance: even so the church of God, which requires
more purely to be governed, then any City or family, can not without
spiritual policy and ecclesiastical discipline continewe, increase, and
florishe. And as the Ephe. 5. f
word of God is the life and soul of this church: so this godly order, and
discipline, is as it were synewes in the body, which knit and join the
members to gether with decent order and comelynes. It is a bridle to stay the
wicked from their myschiefes. It is a spur to prick forward such as be
slow and necligent, yea and for all men it is the fathers rod ever in a
readiness, to chastise gentelye the fautes committed, and to cawse them
afterward, to live in more godly fear, and reverence. What discipline is.
Finallye it is an order left by God unto his church, What discipline is.
whereby men learn to frame their wills, and doings, according to the law of
God, hy instructing, and admonishi^ge one an other yea and by correctinge, and
ponishinge all obstinate rebels, and contemners of the same. There are three
cawses chiefly which move the church of God to the executinge of discipline.
For what causes it oght to be used.
First, that men of evil conversation, be not nombred emongst Gods childrene,
to their fathers Ephe. 5. f.
reproach, as if the church of God were a sanctuary for naughty and vile
persons. The second respect is, that the good be not infected with compagnyinge
the evil, which thing. S. Paul forsawe when he commanded the Corinthians to
banishe from emongst them the incestuous adultether, sai^ge, a little 1. Cor.
3. b. Gal 5. b.
leauyn makes sour the whole lump of dowe. The third cawse is, that a man
thus corrected, or excommunicated, might be 2. The. 3. b. 1. Cor. 5. c.
ashamed of his faut, and so through repentance come to amendment: the which
thing the Apostole calls deliueringe to Satan, that his soul may be saved
in the day of the lord: meaning that he might be ponished with excommunication,
to the intent his soul should not perish for ever. First therefore it is to be
noted that this censure, corrrection or discipline is either private or
public: The order of procedinge in private discipline.
private, as if a man committ either in manners or doctrine against thee, to
admonish him brotherly Matt. 18. b. luc 17. a. iam. 5. d. leu. 19. d. 2. These.
3. d.
betwixt him and thee: if perchance he stubburnely resist thy charitable
aduertisementes, or else by contynuance in his faut declare that he amendeth
not, then, after he has been the second time warned in presence of two or
three witnesses, and continues obstinately in his error, he oght as our savior
Christ commands, to be disclosed and uttered to the church, so that
according to public discipline, public discipline.
he either may be received through repentance, or else be ponished as his faut
requires. And here, as towchinge private discipline three things are to be
noted. First, What things are to be observed, in private discipline.
that our admonitions proceed of a godly zeal, and conscience, rather sekinge
to win our brother, then to slander him. Next, that we be assured that his
faut be reprouuable by gods word. And finally, that we use such modesty and
wisdome^, that if we somewhat dout of the matter whereof we admonish him, yet
with godly exhortatio^s, he may be brought to the knowlage of his faut. Or if
the faut apperteyne to many, or be known of diverse, that our admonition be
done in presence of some of them. Brefly, if it concern the whole church, in
such sort that the concelinge thereof might procure some danger to the same,
that then it be uttered to the ministers, and seniors, to whom the policy, of
the church does apperteine. Also in public discipline, of public discipline,
and of the end thereof.
it is to be observed that the Ministry pretermit nothing at any time
vnchastised with one kind of ponishement or other: if they perceive any thing
in the Congregation, either evil in example, slanderous in manners, or not
besemynge their profession: as if there be any covetous person, any adulterer
or fornicator, forsworn, thief, briber, false witness bearer, blasphemer,
dronkarde slaunderer, usurer, any person disobedient, seditious, or dissolute,
any heresy, or sect, as papisticall, anabaptisticall, and such like, briefly
what so ever it be that might Ephe. 5. f.
spott the christian congregation, yea rather what so ever is not to
edification, oght not to escape either admonition, or ponishement. And becawse
it happens sometime in the church of Christ, that when other remedies
assayed proffitt nothing they must proceed to the Apostolical rodd and
correction, Excommunication is the last remedy
as unto excommunication (which is the greatest and last ponishement belonginge
to the spiritual ministry) it is ordained, that nothing be attempted in
that behalf, with out the determination of the whole church, wherein also they
must be ware, and take good heed, Rigor in ponishements oght to be avoided.
that they seem not more ready to expel from the congregation then to
receive again those, in whom they perceive worthy fruits of repentance to
appear. Neither yet to forbid him the hearing of sermons, which is excluded
from the sacraments, and other duties of the church, that he may have
liberty, and occasion to repent. Finally, that all ponishementes, corrections,
Gods Word is the only rule of discipline.
censures, and admonitions, stretche no farther, then Gods word, with mercy,
may lawfully bear.

ONE AND FIFTY PSALMS OF DAVID in English meter, whereof, 37. were made by
Thomas Sterneholde, and the rest by others: co^ferred with the Hebrewe, and in
certain places corrected, as the text and sens of the Prophet required.
Beatus vir qui non abiit. Psalm. I. Th. Ster.
whether it was Esdras, or any other that gathered the Psalms into a book: it
seems he did set this psalm first, in manner of a preface, to exhort all
godely men to study and meditate the heavenly wisdom. for the effect hereof
is, that they be happy, which give them selves wholly all their life to gods
law: And that the wicked contemners of God, though they seem for a while
fortunate, yet at length shall come to miserable destruction.

when a man has given once place to his concupiscence, he begins to forget
him self in his sin, and so at length falls into a contempt of god, which
the prophet here calls the chair or seat of scorners.
^THe man is blessed that has not bent to wicked read his ear: nor ^led his life
as sinners do, nor sat in scorners chair. But in the law of god the lord
does set his whole delight, and in that law does exercise himself both day and
night.

The Ptophete David reioyseth that, notwithstanding his ennemies rage and
worldly power: yet God will contynew his kyndome for ever and advance it even
to the foremost end of the world. And therefore exhorts kings and rulers, that
settinge vain glory a part, they would humbly submit them selves under Gods
yoke, for it is in vain to resist. Here in, is figured Christ and his kingdom,

^Vhy did the gentiles tumultes raise, what rage was in their brain? why did

David being persecuted, and driven out of his kingdom by his own son
Absalom, was greatly tormented in mind for his sins against God: and
therefore calls upon God, and waxes boulde through his promesses, against the
great terrors of his ennemies, yea and against death it self, which he saw
present before his eyes. Finally he reioyseth for the good success, and
victory, that God gave him, and all the church over his ennemies.

promise, and therefore boldly reproves his ennemies, who by wilful malice
resisted his dominion. And finally prefarreth the favor of God before all
worldely threasures. Let us likewise learn to trust in Gods promesses, when we
are afflicted with any kind of Cross, and so we shall neither fear our
ennemies, nor yet be overcome with tentations.

adversaries. After being assured of prosperous success, he conceyueth
comfort: Concluding that when God shall deliver him, others also shall be
partakers of the same mercies.

desires forgiveness, bewailinge that if God took him a way in his indignation
he should lack occasion to praise him as he was wont to do whils he was

ennemies which reioysed in his affliction.

Domine Deus meus. Psalm. VII. Th. St.
Being falsely accused by Chus, one of Saul's kynsemen, he calls to God to be
his defender, to whom he comendeth his innocence. first shewinge that his

vain enterprises of his ennemies, threateninge that it shall fall on their own

^O Lord my god, I put my trust and confidence in thee: save me from them that

The Prophet consideringe the excellent liberality and fatherly providence
of God toward man, whom he made as it were a God over all his woorks, does
not only give great thanckes, but is astonished with the admiration of the
same as one nothing able to compass such great mercies, and so ends.

Confitebor tibi. Psalm. IX. Th. Ster.
After he had given thancks to God for the sondrye victories that he had sent
him against his ennemies, and also prouen by manifold experience how ready God
was at hand in all his troubles: he being nowlikewise in danger of new
ennemies, desires God to help him according to his wont, and destroy the
malicious arrogancy of his adversaries.

^VVith heart and mouth unto the lord will I sing laud and praise: and speak

Domine, vt quid recessisti. Psalm. X. Th. Ster.
He complayneth of the fraud, rapine, tirannye, and all kinds of wrong,
which worddely men use, assignyng the cawse thereof, which was that wicked men
being as it were drunk with wordelie prosperity, and therefore setting aparte
all fear and reverence toward god, think they may do all things without

desperate euels. And at length conforteth him selff wirh hope of delyueraunce.

^VVhat is the cause that thou o lord, art now so far from thine? and kepest

In Domino confido. Psalm. XI. Th. Ster.
This psalm contains two parties. In the first David shows how hard
assaults of tentacions he sustained, and in how great anguishe of mind he was
when Saul did persecute him. Then next he reioyseth that God sent him succor in
his necessity, declaryng his justice as well in gouernyng the good and the
wicked men, as the whole world.

^I Trust in god, how dare ye then say thus my soull until? ^flee hence as

Saluum me fac. Psalm. XII. Th. St.
The Prophet lamenting the miserable estate of the people, and the decay of all
good order, desiereth God spedely to send succor to his children. Then
comfortyng him selff and othere with the assurance of Gods help, he
commends the constant verity that god observes in keeping his promyses.
Concludyng that when all orders are most corrupted then will God deliver his.

^HElpe lord, for good and godly men do perish and decay: and faith and truth

Vsquequo Domine. Psalm. XIII. Th. Ster.
David as it were ouercorne with sondrie and new afflictions, flees to God as
his only refuge, and so at the length being encoraged through gods
promesses, he co^ceyueth most sure confidence against the extreme horrors of
death.

^HOw long wilt thou forget me lord, shall I never be remembered? how long wilt
thou thy visage hide, as though thou were offe^did? In heart and ^mynde how

Dixit insipiens in cord. Psalm. XIIII. Th. Ster.
He describes the perverse nature of men which were so grown to lycentiousnes
that god was bro ght to utter contempt, for the which thing although he was
greatly greaued: yet being persuaded that God would send some present remedy,
he comfort him self and others.

^THere is no god as folish men affirm in their mad mode: their driftes are
all corrupt and vain not one ^of them does good, the lord beheld rome heaven

Domine quis habitabit. Psalm. XV. Th. Ster.
This psalm. teaches on what condition, god did choose the Jews for his
peculiar people, and wherefore he placed his temple among them, which was to
the intent, that they by living vprightlie and godly, might wittenes that they
were his special and holy people.

^O Lord within thy tabernacle who shall in habit still? or ^whome will thou

Conserua me Domine. Psalm. XVI. Th. Ster.
David prays to god for succor, not for his works but for his faithes sake,
protestyng that he hates all Idolatry, taking God only for his comfort and
felicity: who suffers his to lack nothing.

^LOrde keep me for I trust in thee, and do confess in deed: thou ^art my

Exaudi Domine. Psalm. XVII. Th. St.
Here he complayneth to God of the cruel pride and arrogancy of Saul and the
rest of his enemies, who this raged withowte any cawse given on his part,
therefore he desiereth God to revenge his innocencye, and deliver him. This
Psalm ought diligently to be noted of such as receive evil, for well doing.

^O Lord give ear to my just cause, attend when I complain: and hear the
prayer that I put Thou ^furth with lips that do not feign, and let the

Coeli enarrant. Psalm. XIX. Th. Ster.
To the intent he might move the faithful to a dieper consideration of gods
glory, he sets before their eyes the most exquysite workmanship of the
heavens with their proportion and ornaments. And afterward calls them to
the law, wherein god has reveled him selff more familiarelie to his chosen
people. the which peculiar grace by commendyng the law, he settith forth more

the least to fear him for the thunders and tempests, for fear whereof all
creatures tremble. And though thereby god threateneth sinners, yet is he always
merciful to his, and moves them there by to praise his name.

^GEue to the lord ye potentates, ye rulers of the world give ^ye all praise,
honor, and strength unto the lyuinge lord. Give glory to his holy name, and
honor him alone: worship him in his majesty within his holy throne.


even as himself does please:
He does prepare the thunderclappes, He means the thu^derings and tempests.

Exaltabo te Domine. Psalm. XXX. I. H.
when David should have dedicated his house to the Lord, he fell so extreme
sick, that he was without all hope of life, and therefore after his recovery he
renders thancks to god, exhortinge others to do the like, and learn by his
example that god is rather merciful then severe and rigorous toward his
children, and also that the fall from prosperity to adversity is sodeyn. This
done he retourneth to prayer, promisinge to praise god for ever.

^ALL laud and praise with heart and voice o lord I give to the: which did
not make my foes rejoice, but haste exalted me. o lord my god to thee I cried,
in all my pain and ^griefe: thou gave an ear and did provide to ease me
with relief. Of thy good will thou have called back my soul from hell to save:
thou did revive when strength did lack, and kept me from the grave.


The goodness of the Lord:
In memory of his majesty,
Rejoice with one accord.

Does last and slake again:
But in his favor and his grace,
Alwais does life remain.
Though gripes of grief and panges full sore,
Shall lodge with us all night:
The lord to joy shall us restore,
Before the day be light.

Thus would I boast and say,
Tushe, I am sure to feel none ill.
This wealth shall not decay.

Had sent me strength and aid:
But when thou turnedst away thy face From prosperity to adversity the fall
is sudden.

My mind was sore dismayde.

To thee, O Lord of might:
My god with playntes I did apply.
And prayde both day and night.

If death destroy my days:
Does dust declare thy majesty,
Or yet thy truth does praise?

O Lord I thee desire:
Do not this simple soul forsake,
Of help I thee require.

Unto a chereful voice:
The mourning weed thou tokest me fro,
and made me to rejoice.

Shall sing unto thee praise:
My Lord my God to thee will I,
Give laud and thanks always.
Beati quorum. Psalm. XXXII. Th. St.
David ponished with grievous sickness for his sins, counts them happy to
whom god does not impute their transgressions. And after that he had
confessed his sins and obtained pardon, he exhorts the wicked men to live
godly, and the good to rejoice.

^THe man is blessed, whose wikednes the lord has clean remitted: and he whose
sin and wretchedness is ^hyd, and also covered. and blessed is he to whom the
lord imputes not his sin: which in his heart, has hid no gyle, nor fraud

Exultate iusti. Psalm. XXXIII. I. H.
He exhorts good men to praise god, for that he has not only created all
things, and by his providence governs the same: but also is faithful in his
promeses. He understands man's heart, and scatereth the counsel of the
wicked. So that no man can be preserved by any creature or man's strength: but
they that put their confidence in his mercy shall be preserved from all
adversity.

^YE righteous in the lord rejoice, it is a semely sight, that upright men with
thank full voice, should praise the god of might. Praise ye the lord with
^harpe and song, in psalms and pleasant things: with lute and instrument
among that sounds with ten stringes.


With courage give him praise:

His works and al his ways.

He has a great good will:
And with his gifts he does delyght,
The earth throughout to fill.
Genesis 1. a.

The heavens al were wroghte:
Their hosts and powers euerychone,
His breath to pass has broghte.

On heaps within the shore:
And hyd them in the depth, to be,
As in an house of store.

Fear god and keep his law:
Ye that inhabit in eiche cost,
Dread him and stand id awe.

At once with present speed:
What he does will is brought to pass
With full effect in deed.
No counsel can preuaill againest god but shall have evil success

The lord does drive to noght:
He does defeat the multitude,
Of their deuyse and thought.

They never slake or swage:
The mocions of his mind and will,
Take place in every age.

As God and guide is known:
Whom he does chose of mere accord,
To take them as his own.

On men mortal by birth:

The dwellers on the earth.

Man's heart and does it frame
For he alone does know the thought,
And woorking of the same.
God only delivers and preserves his people.
16 A king that trusts in his host,
Shall noghte prevail at length:
The man that of his migth does bost,
Shall fall for all his strength.

Their sturdy stedes shall sterue:
The strength of horse shall not prevail
The ryder to preserve.

And watch to aid the just:
With such as fear him to offend,
And on his goodness trust.

May set their souls from dread:
And if that darth the land oppress,
In hunger them to feed.

On God our strength and stay:
He is the shield us to defend,
And drive all darts away.

Rejoicing in his might:
For why, in his most holy name,
We hope and much delyght.

Benedicam Domino. Psalm. XXXIIII. Th. Ster.
After David had escaped Achis, according as is written in the 1. Sam. 21.
whom in this title he calls Abimelech (which was a general name to all the
kings of the Philistynes) he prayseth god for his delyueraunce, prouokyng all
others by his example to trust in god, to fear and serve him, who defendith
the god lie with his Angels, and utterly destroys the wicked in their sins.

^I will give laud,

David being grievously afflicted, blesses them that pity his case, and
complayneth of the treason of his own friends and famyliers, as came to pass

most hearty thanks unto god.

^THe man is blessed that carfull is the nedy to consider, for in the season

The prophet grievously complayneth, that being let by his persecutours,
he could not be present in the congregation of gods people. protestinge, that
although he was separat in body from them: yet his heart was thitherwarde

When wicked men cry out so fast,
Where now is God thy guide?

Therefore my soul as at pittes brincke,

David describes the arrogant tyranny of his adversary Doeg Saul's chief

Quam bonus Israel. Psalm. LXXIII. Th. St.
The Prophet teaches by his example, that neither the wordlie prosperity of
the ungodly, nor yet the affliction of the good, oght to discourage gods
children: but rather oght to move us to consider our fathers providence, and to
cawse us to reverence gods judgments, for as much as the wicked vanyshe
away like smoke, and the godly, enter into life everlasting. In hope whereof,
he resigneth him selff into gods hands.

^HOw ever it be, yet god is good and kind to Israel: And to all such, as
safely keep their conscience pure and well. Yet like a fool I almost slipped: my
feet began ^to slide and or I wist even at a pinche my steps awrie began glide.


I grudgd and did disdain:
That wicked men all things should have
without turmoile or pain.

as if death should them smite:
Their bodies are both stowte and strong,
and ever in good plite.

when other men be shent:
And with the rest they take no part,
of plage or punishment.

their necks, as does a chain:
and are even wrapte as in a robe,
with rapine and disdain.

their eyes oftymes out starte:
And as for worldely goods they have
more then can wisshe their heart.

boasting much of the wrong,
Which they have done to simple men,
and ever pride among.

they spare not to blaspheme:
And prate they do on worldely things,
no wight they do esteem.

to see their prosperous state: How hard it is for gods children them selves
to avoid the tentations of the world.

And almost drink the self same cup,
and follow the same rate.

should know and understand
These worldely things: since wicked men
be lords of sea and land?

in riches still increase:
Rewarded well with worldly goods,
and live in rest and peace.

my fantasy refrain:
And wash my hands with innocents,
and cleanse my heart in vain?

as subject to all blame:
And every morning from my youth,
sustain rebuke and shame?

misliking mine estate: Gods children oght not to be contemned because the
worldelings are preferred in dignity and worldely honors.

But that I should thy children judge
as folk unfortunate.
* 16 Than I bethoght me how I might
this matter understand:
But yet the labor was to great,
for me to take in hand.

thy holy place, and then,
I understood right perfitly
the end of al these men.

upon a slippery place:
And at thy pleasure and thy will,
thou do them al deface.

to see how suddenly,
they are destroyed, dispatched, consumd,
and dead so horribly.

so shall their wealth decay:
their famous names in all men's sight,
shall ebb and pass away.

my mind was much oppressed:

and in Heb. before thee
this point a beast.

thou holdst me always fast:

to glory at the last.

but thee in heaven above? Neither superstition nor yet fear or subtlety of
man cold draw him from the true woorshipinge of God.

and in the earth there is nothing
like thee that I can love.

but God does fail me never:
For of my heart God is the strength,
my porcyon eke for ever.

thou shall destroy eychone: Heb. go a whooring from thee

And those that trust in any thing,
sauinge in thee alone.

and ever with him dwell:
In god alone I put my trust,
thy wonders will I tell.
Attendite. Psalm. LXXVIII. Th. St.
He shows how god of his mercy chose his church of the posterity of
Abraham, castyng in their teathe the stubburne rebellion of their fathers, that
the children might not only understand, that god of his free mercy made his
couenaunte with their auncitors, but also seeing them so malicious and perverse,
might be asshamed and so turn wholly to god. In this psalm, the holy ghost
has coprehended (as it were) the some of all gods benefits, to the intent
the ignorant and gross people might see in few words theffecte of the whole
stories.

^Attend my people to my law, and to my words enclyne: my mouth shall speak
strange parables, and sentences divine. which we our selves have heard and
learnde. even of our fathers old: and which for our instruction, our fathers

Of such abundance that no flouddes

* 17 Yet for all this, against the lord,

Nom. 11. g.
31 And slew the flower of all the youth,

and still they did him grieve:
For all the wonders that he wroght

and made their honor vain:
Their years did wast and pass away,

with terroure and with pain.

they sought him by and by:

And with their to^ges and in their hearts

Nor yet to keep or to perform,

In hebrewe the psalm is here divided.
38 Yet was he still so merciful,
when they deserved to dye:
That he forgave them their misdeeds
and would not them destroy.
Yea many a time he turned his wrath

And would not suffer all his whole

and even as a wind:
That passes away and cannot well,

Deus venerunt Gentes. Psalm. LXXIX. I. H.
The Israelites complaigne to God for the great calamity and oppression that
they suffered when Antiochus destroyed their temple, and City Jerusalem,
desiringe Gods ayed, against his raging tyranny, lest gods name and religion
should be contemned emongs the heathen which should see them thus forsaken and
perish.

^O Lord the gentiles do invade thine heritage to spoil, Jerusalem an heap is
made, thy temple they defoyle: the bodies of thy saints most dear, abroad
to birds they cast, the flesh of such as do thee ^feare the beasts devour

there is not one of them, to lay there dead in grave.


Almost the world throughout:
The enmies at us jest and mock,
Which dwell our costs about.

Against us ever fume?
And show thy wrath as hot as fire,
Thy folk for to consume?

And aid us Lord in all assaults,
For we are weak and low.

On us declare the same:
Way not our works, our sins deface
For honor of thy name.

To us as people domme:
In thy reproach rejoice and say,
Where is their God becomme?

Before our eyes in sight:
Of al these folk thy servants blood,
Which they spilt in despite.

The clamours, grief, and wrong:
Of such as are in prison cast,
Sustayning yrons strong.
Thy force and strength to celebrate,
Lord set them out of band:
Which unto death are destinate,
And in their enmies hand.
The troubled heart utters diverse affections in praying

Into their lappes with seven fold,
Repaye again the same.

And teach all ages for to keep
For thee like praise in store.
Deus stetit. Psalm. LXXXII. I. H.
The prophet declaringe god to be present emongst the judges and magistrates,
reproves their parcialitie and unrighteousness, and exhorts them to do
justice. but saying no amendeme^t, he desires god to undertake the matter and
execute justice him self.

^AMyd the prease with men of might, the lord him self did stand: ^to plead

The fatherles and weak:
And when the poor man does contend,
In judgment justly speak.

Of poor, men in their right:
And rydde the nedye from the claws
Of tyrauntes force and might.

In vain to them I talk:
They will not see or oght discern,
But still in darkness walk.

For why, all nations are thine own
To take them as thy right.

This is a psalm most excellent, wherein the prophet does provoke men and
Angels, and all creatures to praise the Lord for his fatherly mercies, and
deliverance of his people from all euells, for his providence over all things,

^MY soul give laud unto the lord, my spirit shall do the same: and all the

Of the Articles of faith.
The M nister.


The Child. To know God. whereunto man was createde and made.



The minister. What moves the to say so?


The child. Because he has created us, and placed us in this world, to set
forth his glory in us. And it is good reason that we employ our whole life to
the auauncement of his glory, seeing he is the original, beginning, and
fountain thereof.


The minister. What is then the principal and chief felicity of man?


The child. Even the self same, I mean to know God, The greatest felicity
that man ca^ attain to.
and to have his glory showed forth in us.


The minister. Why do thou call this, man's chief felicity?


The child. Because that without it, our condicyon or state, were more
miserable then the state of brute beasts.


The minister. Hereby then we may evidently see, that there can no such
miserye happen unto man, as not to live in the knowledge of God.


The child. That is most certain.


The minister. But tell me, what is the true and right knowledge of God?


The child. When a man so knows God, that he is in full mind to honor him.


The Minister. Which is the way for a man to honor God a right?


The child. It is to put our whole trust and confidence in him: to study to
serve him, in obeying unto his will and commandments: to seek and call upon
him for help in our necessities, The right manner to worship god, stands in
four points.
looking for salvation and al good things at his hand. And finally to
acknowlage both with heart and mouth, that he is the lively fountain of all
goodness, from whom only al benefits and good things do come.


The minister.


The child. The first is, to put our whole confidence in God alone.


The minister. How may that thing be done?


The child. We must first have an assured knowledge, that as he is almighty,
so he is all bountiful and parfitlie good.


The minister. And is that sufficient? The first point of honoring God.



The child. No.


The minister. Show the reason.


The child. For there is no worthiness in us, why God should either show his
power to help us or use his merciful goodness to save us.


The minister. What is than further required?


The child. This is requisite more, that every one of us be fully assured in
his conscience, that he is beloved of God, and that he will be both his father
and savior.


The minister. How shall we be assured hereof?


The child. By his own word, wherein he utters most plainly unto us, his
plentiful mercy in our savior Christ, and gives us undoubted assurance of
his loving mind toward us.


The minister. The foundation of our faith.
Well, then I perceive that the very ground to come by a sure confydence in God,
is, to know him in our savior Christ.


The child. Yea truly.


The minister. Then briefelye, what is the effect and substance of this
knowledge of God in Christ?


The child. It is contained in the confession of the faith, used of all
Christen men, which is commonly called the Creed of the Apostles: both because
it is a compendyous and a brief gatherynge of the articles of that faith,
which has been always continued in Christ's Church: and also because it
was taken out of the pure doctrine of the Apostles.


The minister. Rehearse the same.


The child. The Creed of the apostles.
I believe in God the father almighty, maker of heaven and earth: And in Jesus
Christ his only son our Lord: Who was conceived by the holy Ghost, borne
of the vyrgyn Marye: Suffered passion under Ponce Pylate, was crucified, dead,
buried, and descended into hell: He rose again the third day from death: He
ascended into heaven, and sytteth on the right hand of God the father
almyghtye: From thense he will come to judge the quick and the dead.

I believe in the holy ghost: The holy Church universal, the communion of
Gods elect: the forgiveness of sins: the rising again of the bodies: and
life everlasting.


The minister.


The child. In to four principal parts. The Christian faith stands in
four points



The minister. What be they?


The child. The first concerns God the father. The second part is of the
son of God, our savior Christ: wherein briefly also the whole story of our
redemption is rehearsed. The third is touching the holy ghost. The fourth
concerns the holy Church, and Gods free gifts unto the same.


The minister. Seeing there is but one God, what moves thee to make rehearsal
of God the father, God the son, and God the holy ghost, as if there were three
gods?


The child. As concerning the Trinity.
Because that in the substance or nature of God we have to consider the Father,
as the fountain, beginning, and original cause of al things: then
secondarely, his son, who is his everlasting wisdom: and thyrdly the holy
ghost, who is his inco^prehensible virtue and puissaunte might, which is
exte^ded and spread upon all creatures: and yet nevertheless remains always
wholly in himself.


The minister. This is then the meaning: that there is no inconvenience at al,
to understand severally and apart, these three persons in the substance of God,
who notwythstandyng is one, and not thereby divided.


The child. It is even so.


The minister. Make rehearsal now of the first part of the Creed.


The child. The first part of the belief.
I believe in God the father almighty, maker of heaven and earth.


The minister. Wherefore do thou call him Father?


The child. I call him so, having respect to Jesus Christ, who is the
everlasting word begotten of God before all worlds, without beginning: The
fathe.
who being afterward openly showed unto the world, was euidentlye approuued
and declared to be his son. Now seeing God is our Savior Christ's father,
it follows necessarilye that he is also our father.


The minister. What meanest thou by that, thou call him Almightye?


The child. In that I say he is Almightye, what is meant by this word almighti.
I mean not that he has a power which he does not exercise: but contrariwise,
that al creatures be in his hand and under his gouerna^ce: that he orders and
dysposeth all things by his unsearchable wisdom and providence: that he
rules the world as it pleases him: and that continually he guydeth al
things therein after his own good pleasure.


The minister. So then by thy saying, the power of God is not idle The power of
god is not idle.
nor unoccupied, but continually exercised: so that nothing is done, but by
him, or by his leave and ordinance.


The child. It is even as you say.


The minister. Maker of heaven and earth?


The child. Because he has made himself known unto us by his works, it is
necessary for us to seek him out in the^. Psalm. 14. Roma. 1.
For our capacytye, and the reach of our understanding is not sufficie^te
nor able to co^prehende his divine substance, but he has made the world as a
myrroure or glass, A glass wherein we may see God.
wherein we may behold his divine majesty, in such sort as it is expediente
for us to know him.


The minister. Do thou not comprehend all creatures in these two words,
heaven and earth?


The child. Yes verily: and they may right well be understood in these two
words, seeing that all things be either heavenly, or earthlye.


The minister. And why call thou God only by the name of creator or maker?
seeing that to order things, and to conserve them always in their state, is a
thing of much more importance, then to have for one time created them.


The child. By this word Creator, it is not only meante that he did once
create them, having no farther regard to them afterward: But we ought to
understand, that as the world was made of him in the beginning, even so now
he does co^serue the same, and vpholdeth the state of things, so that heaven
and earth, with the rest of the creatures, Concerning the providence of God.
could not continue in their estate, if his power did not preserve them.
Moreover, saying in this manner he does maintain all things, holding them
(as it were) in his hand: it must needs follow, that he has the rule and
governance of all. Wherefore in that that he is creator of heaven and earth, it
is he that by his bountyfull goodness, mighty power, and high wisdom, does
conducte and guide the whole order of nature. It is he that sends rain and
drought, hail, tempests, and fair wether: he se^deth fertilite and barennes,
dearth and plenty, health and sycknes: and to be short, he has all things
at commandment, to do him service at his own good pleasure.


The minister. What say thou as touching the deuels and wicked persons, be
they also subject to him, and at his commandment?


The child. Albeit that God does not guide them with his holy spirit,
Concerning deuylles.
yet he does brydell them in such sort that they be not able to stir or move
without his permission and appointment: yea and moreover, he does compel them
to execute his will and pleasure, although it be clean against their intent
and purpose.


The minister. To what purpose does it serve thee to know this?


The child. The knowledge hereof does wonderfully comfort us, for we might
think our selves in a miserable case, if the deuylles and the wicked had power
to do any thing contrary to Gods will or appointment. And moreover we could
never be quiet in our consciences, if we should think our selves to be in their
danger. The devil has no power but of God.
But forsomuche as we know that God brydeleth them fast, and chayneth them, as
it were in a prison, in such wise that they can do nothing, but as he
permits: we have just occasion, not only to be quiet in mind, but also
to receive most confortable joy, since God has promised to be our protector
and defender.


The minister. The second part of the belief.



The child. And in Jesus Christ his only son, our Lord.


The minister. What is bryeflye the effect and substance of this part?


The child. It is to acknowledge the son of God to be our savior: and to
understand the mean whereby he has redeemed us from death, and purchased life
unto us.


The minister. What sygnifyeth this word Jesus, by which thou namest him?


The child It is as much to say, as Savior: This word Jesus. Matt. 1.
and this name was given unto him by the angel at Gods commandment.


The minister. What? is that of more estimacion, than if that name had been
given unto him by men?


The child. Yea a great deal: for since Gods pleasure was that he should
be so named, it gives us certain knowledge that he is our very savior in
deed.


The minister. What sygnifyeth then this word Christ, which follows after?
This word Christ.



The child. This word, Christ, does express more effectually his office: and
does us to wete that he was anointed of our heavenly father, to sygnifye that
he was ordained to be a king, Priest, and Prophet.


The minister. How have thou the knowledge hereof?


The child. By the scripture, which does suffyciently teach us that
anointynge did serve for these three offices, or dignities, the which be also
attributed unto him in many places of the scriptures.


The minister. But, what manner of oil was it wherewith he was anointed?


The child. It was no such material oil, as we use, and as did serve in old
time, to the ordeininge or institution of kings, Priests, and Prophets: but
a far more excellent oil, even the grace of Gods holy spirit, whereof the
aunciente anointing in the old testamente was a figure.


The minister. What manner of kingdom is that whereof thou speak?


The child. This kingdom of Christ The kingdom o Christ.
is not earthly, but spiritual, the substance whereof does consist in Gods
word, and in his holy spirit, wherein is contained both righteousness and
life everlasting.


The minister. And what is his Priesthood?


The child. It is an office and auctorytie to present himself before God,
The pristhoode of Christ. Heb. 7.8.9 10.13.
to obtain grace and favor for us: and to pacifye his fathers wrath, by
offering up the most acceptable sacryfyce of him self unto him.


The minister. Why call thou him a Prophet?


The child. Because that he came down into the world, wherein Christ war a
Prophet Esa. 7. Hebr. 1.
to bring unto us the most worthy and joyful embassy or message of God his
father: to declare at large most evidently to the world his fathers will, and
to finishe all revelations and Prophecyes.


The minister. Comes there any profit unto thee by those names and dignities
of Christ?


The child. Yea they altogether belong to our comfort, and proffit. For
Christ did receive all these of his father, to make us partakers thereof, whereby
we might every one receive of his fullness.


The minister. Declare this thing unto me more at large.


The child. He received the holy ghost in most full perfection, with all the
gifts and graces of the same: to bestow them on us, and to distribute them
unto every one of us in the measure and quantytye that God knows to be most
mete and expediente for us: and so by this means we draw out of him, as if
it were out of a fountain, Christ is the fontayne of all goodness.
all the spiritual gifts that we have.


The minister. To what use does the kingdom of Christ serve us?


The child. To what use the kyngdo^e of Christ serves us.
To set us in liberty of conscience, to live godly and holily, that we being
enriched with his spiritual treasures, and armed with his power, may be able
to overcome the devil, sin, flesh, and the world, which be every one
pernycyous enemies unto our souls.


The minister. What profit have we of his priesthood?


The child. The profit of Christ's priesthood. Hebru. vii.viii.ix.x.xiii.
First by this means he is our mediator to bring us into the favor of God his
father: and again hereby we have a fre entrye to come in and show our
selves boldly before God: and to offer up our selves with all that belongs
unto us, for a sacrifice, and in this point we are fellows after a sort of his
priesthood.


The minister. The vtilitye of his office in that he is a Prophet is yet
behind.


The child. Since our lord Jesus has received this office to become the
master and teacher of his flock: the end of this dignity is, wherefore Christ
was a prophet.
to bring us to the right knowledge of god, and of his truth, so that we
might become Gods household scholars and of his familye.


The minister. This is then it that a man may briefly gather of thy words:
that these three titles or names of Christ, do include three sundry offices, the
which God has given unto his son, to the intent to bestow the fruit, and
profit of the same upon his elect.


The child. Ye say truly.


The minister.


The child. As touching that, that we are Gods children, we be not so borne,
neither does it come of our nature: but only by his fatherly adoption, and by
grace, in that that God does vouchesafe to accept us and take us for his
children: now our Lord Jesus being begotten of one very substance with his
father, and being of the self same nature and godhead, may even of good right
be called Gods only son: for that there is none other that can claim that
title by natural right, but he alone.


The minister. This is then the meaning, that this honor pertayneth
peculiarelye unto him alone, as unto whom it belongs by course natural, the
which notwithstanding he has by free gift of his goodness communicated unto
us, making us partakers thereof, in that we are becomen his own members.


The child. It is even so: and therefore in respect of that his communicatyng
and alyaunce with us, the scripture calls Christ in an other place the
first borne among many brethren.


The minister. What is the meaning of that that follows?


The child. It does us to wete after what sort the son of God was anointed
of his father, to becume our savior: that is to say, he took upon him our
flesh, and therein fulfilled al things necessary for our redemption, according
as they be here rehearsed,


The minister. What meanest thou by these two clauses: Conceived by the holy
Ghost, Borne of the virgin Mary?


The child. The meaning thereof is: Christ became very manne. Psalm. 32 Mat. 1.
Luke. 1.
that he was fashioned in the blessed virgins womb, taking very substance and
manhod of her own body, that he might thereby become the seed of David, as the
Prophets had a long time before sygnyfyed: and yet notwithstanding all this
was wroughte by the secret and merueilous power of the holy ghost, with out
the company of man.


The minister. Was it then needful that he should take upon him our very
flesh?


The child. Roma. 3.
Yea verily: for it was convenient that man's transgression, and his disobedience
against God, should be purged like wise by the nature of man. And moreover if
Christ had not been partaker of our very nature, 1. Timo. 2 Hebr. 4.
he had not been a meet mediatoure to make us at one, and to join us together
with God his father.


The minister. Than this is thy saying: that it behooved that Christ should
become very man, to the end he might execute the office of a savior in our
shape and person.


The child. Christ has performed that which lacked in us.
Yea verily: For we must borowe of him, all that which is lacking in our selves,
for this our defaut cold not otherwise be recovered.


The minister. But for what cause was this thing wrought by gods holy spirit,
and not rather by the company of man, according to the order of nature.


The child. Because the seed of man is of it self all to gether corrupted
with sin; it behooued that this conception of Christ should be wroughte by
the power of the holy ghost, Christ was conceived by the spirit of God.
whereby our savior might be preserved from all corrupcyon of sin, and
replenysshed with all manner of holiness.


The minister. So then by these sayings it is euidenly declared unto us: that
he (which should purifye and cleanse other from fylthe of sin) must be
himself free and clear from all spots thereof, and even from his mothers
womb dedicated, and kept holy unto God in pureness of nature, so that he may
not be guilty of that corrupcyon where with the whole stock of man is
generally infected.


The child That is the very meaning of my words.


The minister.


The child Even by the ordinance of God himself: Christ is our lord.
who also made him our governor, to the end that he might execute his fathers
kingdom both in heaven, and in earth, and that he might be head and ruler
both of Aungelles and of gods faithful people.


The minister. Wherefore speak thou of his death, immediatlye after his
birth? and leaueste out the whole story of his life?


The child. For because there is nothing mentioned or spoken of in our Cred:
but that which peculiarelye belongs to the pyth and substance of our
redemption.


The minister. Why is it not said plainly in one word, that he dyed:
without any speaking of Ponce Pilate, by whose judgment he suffered?


The child. The mention that is made of Ponce Pilate, was not only for this
consideracion to make the storye of Christ's Passion to have more evident
assurance: but also to declare unto us, that his death has taken a way our
condemnacion.


The minister. How so?


The child. First he suffered death, to the end to take a way the pain
that was due unto us, that we might be thereby clearly delivered from the same:
Now for so much as we were in fault and gyltie before gods judgment as
wicked mysdoers: Christ myndyng to take upon him our person, and to bail us,
Christ was condemned to clear us.
by susteyning all our misery: vouchsaued to show himself before yearthly
judges, and to be condemned by the sentence or judgment of the same, that
thereby we might be giltlesse and clear before the judgment seat of our
heavenly judge his father.


The minister. Notwithstanding, Mat. 27. Luke. 23.
Pilate does pronounce him innocent, and so by that he does not condemn him
as woorthye of death.


The child. Pilate did both the one and the other: Christ was co^dened for
us.
first he was pronounced innocente and just, by the judges own mouth, to
sygnifye that he suffered not for his own deserte, but for our trespaces. And
yet withal, the same judge did did give solemnelye the sentence of death
against him, to testifye and express that he is our true pledge and ransom:
Christ was our raunsonne
as he who also has taken unto him our condemnation to make us quite and to
deliver us from the same.


The minister. That is well said: for if he had been a sinner in deed, he had
not been meet to have suffered death for the offenses of other: and
nevertheless to the end that we might be clearly quitte and delivered by his
condemnacyon: Esai. 53.
it was necessary that he should be taken and counted as a malefactoure or
misdoer.


The child. I mean no other thing.


The minister. Christ took upon himself the curse due unto us, that we might
be free.



The child. Yea verily: and touching that matter, Saint Paul says that he
was hanged on a tree, to the intent that he might take upon him our curse,
Deu. 21. Gal. 3.
and so dyscharge us. for that kind of death was accursed of God.


The minister. What? is it not a great reproach and dyshonoure unto our Lord
Jesus, to say that he was accursed, and that before God?


The child. No not a whit: for he through his almyghtye power, by taking the
curse from us unto himself, did in such sort make it void and of none
effect, that he himself nevertheless continued still so blessed, that he was
able to fulfill us also with his blessings.


The minister. Make an exposicio^ of that that follows.


The child. In so much as death was a curse or punyshement appointed unto
man for sin: Christ even in sufferinge death vainqueshed death
therefore our savior Christ did suffer death and by suffering overcame it. And
to the intent also to make it the more certainly known unto us, that his death
was not a colored or counterfaited thing: it pleased him also to be buried
after the common manner of other men.


The minister But it appears not that any profit cummeth to us by this that
Christ has won the victory of death: seeing that we (it not withstanding)
cease not to dye,


The child. The death of the faithful. is a right passage to life everlasting.
That does not hinder, for the death of the faithful is now nothing else,
but a ready passage to a better life.


The minister. It follows then necessarily hereof: that we ought in no wise
to be afraid of death, as though it were a dredefull thing: but rather it
behooves us willingly to walk the trace of our head and captain Jesus
Christ, who has walked and trodden the same way before us, not to the entente
to lead us to our destruction, but to procure us an everlasting sauegarde.


The child. It is even so.


The minister.


The child The understanding of this: Christ went down into hell.
The right meaning thereof is, that Christ did not only suffer a natural
death, which is a departing and going asunder of the body and soul: but also
that his soul was in woo^derfull dystresse, being woefully pressed, and
enduring grievous torments, and as it were hellyke pains, Acts 2.
which Saint Peter calls the sorrows or pangues of death,


The minister. For what consideration sustained he those pains, and in what
sort?


The child Becawse he presented himself before God to be a sacryfice
satisfactory, and to make ame^des in the behalf of sinners, it was mete that
as he did bear the wayght and burden of our sins: so likewise he should
feel this horrible anguyshe, and grievous tormente of conscience which sin
brings, being in case as if God had utterly forsaken him and ben haynously
displeased against him. And in very deed, he was brought to such extremytye
of anguyshe, that he was dryeuen to cry: my God my God, Matt. 27. Mark. 15.
why haste thou forsaken me?


The minister Why? was God then angry with him?


The child Nay, howbeit it was co^ueniente that God should punyshe him in
such sort, Esa. 53. 1. Peter. 2.
to veryfie and perform the words of Esaias the Prophet, who says that he was
beaten with the hand of his father for our sins and that he did suffer the
punishmente due to our trangressyons.


The minister But how could it be that he was in such dreadefull anguyshe,
as though God had utterly forsaken him, seeing he was God himself?


The child We must understand, that he was in such destresse only as
touchi^ge his humanitye. And to the intent that he might feel these panges
in his manhood, his Godhead did in the mean time for a little space keep it
self close, as if it had been hydd, that is to say, it did not show not
utter the mygh thereof.


The minister. But how could this be that Christ, who is the health of the
world, could be under such condemnacion?


The child. He was not so under it, that he should co^tynewe in the same. For
he has in such wise felt these terrors which we have spoken of: that he
was not overcome of the same, but has rather thereby made battayll against the
power of hell to break and destroy it.


The minister. Hereby then we see the difference between that anguish or
vexacion of mind which Christ did suffer: The difference between the
anguishe of Christ's spirit and the conscience of the wicked.
and that which the impenytente sinners do abide, whom God does punyshe in
his terryble wrath: for that very pain which Christ sustained for a time,
the wicked must endure continually: and that which was unto Christ but a goade
as it were, to prycke him: is unto the wicked in stead of a glaiue to wound
them to death,


The child Truth it is: for our sauyoure Christ, notwithstanding these
vexations, eue^ in the mids of his torments, did not cease to put a full
trust evermore in God: but the damned sinners do despair without al
confydence in Gods goodness: yea they stomach against God, in so much that
they blaspheme his majesty.


The minister.


The child Yea very well: The profit and virtue of Christ's death stands
in.iii. points.
and first of all we see that it is a sacryfice wherewith he has fully
aunswared and satysfyed his fathers judgment in our behalf: and thereby also
he has appaised Gods wrath, which worthily hanged over us, and has
brought us into his favor again. Seco^dlye that he shed his blood to
purify and cleanse our souls from al manner of spots: and finally that he
has so clean wyped away our sins through his precious death, that God will
never hereafter have remembrance of them to call us to any reckoninge: yea
euenso, that the obligation or hand writing which was to be showed forth
against us to our condemnation, is now clean cancelled, and utterly made
void


The minister Have we no other profit, besides this of his death?


The child. Yes verily: that is if we be true members of Christ, our old man
is crucyfyed, and our flesh is mortyfied, to the end that no evil lusts or
affections do herafter bear rule in us.


The minister. Expound the article following.


The child. 1. Peter. 3.
He rose the third day from death to life, wheri^ he showed that he had
vaynquished and gotten the victory of death and sin. For through his
resurrection, he swalowed up death, he broke aso^dre the chains wherewith the
devil did hold us in captyuitie: and finally he destroyed all his power and
kingdom.


The minister. Tell me how many ways this resurrection of Christ does
profit us?


The child. Three manner of ways: the first, The benefyte and virtue of
Christ's death stands in.iii points.
that we have fully obtained to be ryghteous thereby. Secondly, that his risinge
from death is asure gage and certain assurance unto us that we shall o^ce
rise again into a life without end and most glorious. Thyrdely, Romans 4.6. 1.
Cor. 15.
that if we be in deed truly partakers of his resurrection, we rise now in
this present world in to a new kind of life, addicted wholly to serve God, and
to lead an holy conversation agreeable to his will and pleasure.


The minister


The child He ascended up into heaven.


The minister Went Christ up into heaven in such sort, that he was no longer
abydinge in the earth?


The child. Yea, Christ ascended into heaven
for when he had performed whollye all things that were enjoined him by the
commandment of his father, and had accomplished all that was necessary for
our health, it was not nedefulle that he should remain any longer in the
world.


The minister. What profit have we by his ascension?


The child. The Profytte of Christ's ascension sta^dyth in two points.
We receive double profit thereby: for since that our sauyoure Christ is
entered into heaven in our name: even inlyke manner as he came down from thence
for our sakes only: he has thereby made an open entrye into the same place
for us, geuynge us withal an assured knowledge, that the gate of heaven is now
wide open to receive us, which was before fast shut, through our sins. The
second profit is, that he sytteth there present alwais in the sight of God
the father to make intercessyon for us, Romans 6. Hebr. 7.
and to be our advocate to make answer for us.


The minister But is our savior Christ so gone out of the world, that he is
no more here with us?


The child Matt. 28.
No dowteles: for he himself says the contrary: that is, that he will be here
present with us unto the worlds end.


The minister. Is it meant of his bodily presence, that he makes promise so to
co^tynue with us?


The child. No verelye: Luke. 24. Acts 1.
for it is a another matter to speak of his body which was lift up out of this
world into heaven: and to speak of his godly power which is spread abroad
throughout the whole world.


The minister. Declare the meani^g of this sentence: He sytteth on the right
hand of God the Father.


The child. The understanding of that is, Matt. 28.
to signifye that he has received into his hands the governance of heaven and
earth, whereby he is king and ruler over al things.


The minister. What signifies this word, ryghthande, and the fyttyng on the
ryghthande, whereof mention is here made?


The child. It is a similitude, or a manner of speech borrowed of earthly
Princes, To sit on the right hand of God.
which are wont to place on their right side, such as they substitute next
under them to see to the execution of laws and to supplye their room and
office in their stead.


The minister Then thou meanest nothing else thereby, Ephe. 1.
but that which S. Paul speaks to the Ephesians: that he was constitute and
appointed head of the Church, set in authority above all powers, Philip. 2.
and that he has received a name or dignity passing all other.


The child. My meaning is none other.


The minister. Go forward to the residue.


The child. Acts 1.
wherein he was seen to ascend.


The minister. Seeing the judgment of God shall be in the end of the world,
how may that be which thou say, some shall be a live, and other some shall be
dead: namely since also it is a thing most certainly oppointed unto all men,
Hebr. 9.
to dye once?


The child. S. Paul makes answer to this question himself, saying, that
they which at that time shall be left on live, 1. Cor. 15. 1. These. 4.
shall be suddenly changed in a moment of time: to the end that their corruptible
nature may be altered and that they may receive a new body which shall be no
more subject to corruption.


The minister. Thy meaning is then that this alteration or change shall be unto
them in stead of a death, in somuche as it shall do a way and abolyshe their
former nature, and make them rise again in a new and more glorious state


The child It is even so.


The minister. Do we receive any comfort by this that our savior Christ will
come once to judge the world?


The child Yea verily, and that a synguler great comfort: for we are taught
certeynly, that his coming at that time shall be only for our salvation.


The minister. Well then there is no cause why we should be afraid of the day
of judgment, or wherefore we should loathe the cummyng thereof.


The child. No truly: Christ shall both Judge us and answer for us.
for so much as we shall appear before no other judge but him, who is our
advocate and has taken upon him to defend our cawse.


The minister.


The child That part concerns our faith and confidence in the holy ghost.
The third part of the creed.



The minister. And to what purpose does it serve us?


The child. It does us to understand, that even as God has first redeemed us,
Of the holy ghost and his gifts.
and given everlasting health unto us in Jesus Christ, eue^ so it pleased him to
make us partakers of these his graces and benefits through his holy spirit.


The minister. How so?


The child. In like manner as the blood of Christ is the only thing that
pourgeth our souls: 1. Peter. 1.
eue^ so the holy ghost must sprinkle and moysten our consciences with the same
to make them pure and clean.


The minister. Yet this needs a more evident declaration.


The child. It is no more to say, but that the holy spirit of God dwelling
in our hearts, does make us feel the virtue, and goodness of our Lord Jesus:
Romans 5.
for it is he that does open the eyes of our heart to behold gods benefits
toward us: he does seal and imprint his aboundante graces in our souls:
and this spirit does also regenerate us, and make us new creatures, in such
sort, Ephe. 1.
that by his means we receive to our most comfort, al those gifts and
benefits which be offered unto us so plentifully in Christ our savior.


The minister


The chide. The fourth part of our belief, The fowerth part which is of the
church.
where it is said: I believe that there is a Catholic or uniuersal church.


The minister What is this Church?


The child It is the fellowship or congregation of them that believe, what the
church is.
whom God has ordained and chosen unto life everlasting.


The minister. Is it necessary that we believe this artiticle?


The child Yea it is a thing very necessary, unless we mind to make Christ's
death utterly void and of none effect, and to make all those things
superfluous and to no purpose, which we have rehearsed already: for the
church is the very fruit that proceadeth of all Christ's dooinges.


The minister, This is tha^ thy sayi^g that all which hither to has been
declared, For what purpose Christ suffered death
does touch the cause, and grownde of our salvation, insomuche as God has
received us into his favor, by the means of our savior Jesus Christ: and
has stablished this grace in us through his holy spirit. But now the effect
that cu^meth of all this, is declared unto us, to give the more evident
assurance thereof.


The child. It is even so as you say.


The minister. What meanest thou by saying The holy church?


The child. I call the Church holy in this sense, because that those who^ God
has chosen, he justifies and renueth unto holiness and innocency of life, to
make his glory to shine in the^. Ephe, 5.
And also our savior Christ has sanctified his church, which he redemede,
to the end it might be glorious and without spot.


The minister What means this word, Catholic or universal?


The child The meaning of this word catholic. Ephe. 4. 1. Cor. 12.
It serves to put us in remembrance, that as there is but one head of the
right beleuers, eue^ so it behooves the^ to be knit together in one body: i^
such sort that there be not diverse churches, but one church alonely dispersed
thorowout the whole world.


The minister. Declare as touchi^g the communion of saints.


The child. The communion of the faithful
That clause is put to, for a more plain declaration or setting forth of the
unity and coupling together of the members of Christ's church. Moreover it
does us to understand, that all the benefits that Christ has given, and all
the good that he has done for his church, belongs to the profit and
salvation of every faithful person, for so much as they have all a common
partaking together.


The minister.


The child. No verily, for it is in contynuall battayll so long as we are in
this world and laboreth always under imperfection and infirmities which shall
never be clean taken a way, until we be al together coupled to our head Jesus
Christ, by whom we are perfitly sanctified, and made holy.


The minister. Is there no other way to know this church but by belief or
faith?


The child. Yes verily, there is a church or company of Gods people which
may be seen to the eye, for so much as God has given outward tokens and
Sacraments by the which we may know the same. But here in this place me^cio^
is made only of the peculiar and chosen co^pani of Gods children who^ whom
he has chosen to everlasting life: the which feloweshyppe cannot be
perfectely discerned here by our senses nor by outward tokens.


The minister What is there more?


The child. Touching the forgiunes of sins.
I believe the remission of our sins.


The minister What is the right or proper signification of this word,
Remissyon?


The child. It signifies properlye that God does freelye forgive all the
sins of them which believe in him, in such sort, that they shall never be
called to any accounte: neither shall they make any answer before Gods
justice seat, thereby to receive any punishment.


The minister. It is easy than to be gathered of this, that we do not merit
or deserve by any satisfaction or amends that we can make, that God should
pardon our sins.


The minister. Ye say true: for our savior Christ has made the full payment
himself, and has sustained the pain due unto the same: for we of our part,
be not able to make any manner of recompense, but we are drieue^ to seek upon
God, that of his mere liberality, we may obtain this benefyt freely.


The minister. Wherefore do thou make mention of remissyon immediatelye
after that thou have spoken of the church?


The child. Because that no man can receive forgeuenes of his sins unless
he be incorporated, There is no remission of sins without the body of the
church:
and joined in the fellowship of Gods people, and so continue in the unity
and common partakynge of Christ's benefits, with the same his body even to
the end, like a true membre of his Church.


The minister. By this saying than, without the church there is nothing but
hell, death, and damnacion.


The child. That is most certain: for all such as do divide and disseuer them
selves from the body of Christ, to the intent to make a sect and break the
unity thereof, are utterly destitute of al hope to enjoy everlasting life,
whiles they keep themselves so divided and a part.


The minister.


The child Of our resurrection.
The rysyng again of the body, and life everlasting.


The minister. Whereto serves this article in our belief?


The child. It does us to understand, that our joy and felicity consysteth
not in any thing upon earth: the which knowledge may serve us for two
necessary purposes: The first it serves to teach us to pass through this
transitory world, as if it were through a strange countreye, setting little by
the things of this world, and not setting our affectyon on things of so
unstable continuance. Then secondarily it puts us in cou^fort, that
although as yet we have no full taste or enjoying of the felicity which our
Lord god has freelye prepared for us in our savior Christ, that yet we
ought not for that to dyscourage our selves, but patiently to wait for him
unto the time that he shall appear.


The minister. What shall be the manner of our resurrection?


The child. Al they which be dead before that time shall then take their own
bodies again unto them: 1. Cor. 15.
howbeit they shall be of a another sort or fashion: that is to wete, they shall be
no more subject, to death or corrupcion: and yet notwithstanding they shall be
of the self same nature and substance as before. And such as shall then
remain alive, God will raise them up maruelously and suddenly change their
bodies, in the twinklinge of an eye, (as we have said before.)


The minister. Shall not the wicked be as well partakers of this resurrection,
as the faithful?


The child. Yes verily, but they shall be in condycion or state far unlike:
for the one (that is to wete) the faithful, Ihon. 5. Matt. 25.
shall rise again to everlasting joy and felycitye, and the other to
everlasting death, and damnacion.


The minister. Wherefore then is there not as well mention made of hell, and
death everlasting, as of heaven and life that endures for ever?


The child Because the Creed is a brief sum of our faith conteinynge in as
few words as can be, that, that belongs peculyerly to comfort the
consciences of Gods faithful: therefore Gods benefytes which he freely
bestows upon his people be rehearsed alonely, without any mencyon of the
wicked, who are clean shute out of his kingdom.


The minister.


The child. what a thing lively faith is,
Yea verily: that is to say, it is a sure persuasion and a steadfast knowledge
of Gods tender love to wards us, according as he has plainly uttered in his
gospel, that he wylbe both a father, and a sauyoure unto us through the
means of our Lord Jesus Christ.


The minister. Is this faith a thing standing in our power, either is it a
free gift that God gives at his pleasure?


The child. The scripture teaches us that it is a special gift of the holy
ghost, and very experience does also confirm the same.


The minister. And why so?


The child. For the feebleness of our wits is such, that we can by no means
attain unto the understanding of Gods wisdom and the secrets of his
spirit, the which things be opened and made known unto us by faith: and
our hearts are naturally inclyned to a certain distruste, or at lest avaine
trust either in our selves, The holy ghost does lyghten our minds.
or in other creatures: but what time Gods spirit has lyghtened our hearts,
and made us able to understand Gods will (the which thing we can not attain
other wise) tha^ does he arm us also with a steadfast co^fydence in his
goodness, sealinge (as it were) and impryntyng the promises of everlasting
health in our hearts,


The minister. What profit comes to us through this faith when we have it?


The child. It does justify us, before God, This faith makes us sure of our
righteousness.
and makes us enherytours of everlasting life.


The minister. Why? the^ is not a man iustyfyed through good works, if he live
holylye, and in the obedience of Gods will?


The child. If any manne were to be found so perfect, as to lead his life
uprightly before God, such a one might worthelye be called a ryghteous manne:
but forsomuche as we every one, may justly count our selves wretched
sinners in the sight of God: we are of necessytye driven, to seek else where
for a worthynes to make answer for us to Gods judgment.


The minister.


The child First, al such works as we do of our selves, by the inclination
of our own nature, Al man's works be damnable until they be regenerate
through gods sprite.
are utterly corrupt. Whereof it follows necessarily, that they can not please
god, but rather do provoke his wrath, and he condemns them every one.


The minister. This is then thy saying: that unto the time that God has of
his favorable goodness received us to mercy, we can do no manner of thing but
sin: Mat. 7
even as an evil tree can bring forth no fruit but that that is evil.


The child. It is even so: for although our works make a fair show
outwardely to man's syghte: yet without doubt they are wicked in Gods
sight, for so much as the heart is naught, and ungracious, unto the which God
chiefly has respect.


The minister. Hereby then thou do conclude that it lies not in our power,
to preuente God with our merytes: and so to provoke him to love us, but much
rather contrarywyse, we thereby do stir him to be more and more angry against
us.


The child. Yea surely: and therefore I say, that without any manner
consyderacion of our own works, he does accept and receive us into his
favor, of his mere lyberall goodness, and bountyful mercy, Titus. 3
through the merits of our savior Christ, accountyng his righteousness to be
ours, and for his sake, so forgetting our fautes, that he will lay them no
more to our charge.


The minister. What meanest thou then that a man is iustyfied by his faith?


The child, Justification or righteousness is attributed unto faith, for
somuche as through believing (that is) receiuynge with an assurance of the
heart, the promyses of the gospel, we enter into possessyon of this
ryghteousnes.


The minister. This is bryfely thy meaning, that even as God does present and
offer this ryghteousnes freelye unto us in his gospel, even so the only mean
or way to receive that excellent gift of GOD, is faith.


The child. Yea forsooth.


The minister.


The child. The good works which proceed only of faith.
Yeas verily, because he does of his free goodness, so accept them and take
them: and not because their worthiness does deserve so to be esteemed.


The minister. How is it that they be not worthy of themselves to be accepted
since they be works procedynge of the holy ghost?


The child. For So Much as we carry always some infirmity of the flesh about us,
which will have a stroke and a doing in all our works, whereby they are defiled.


The minister. By what means then are they made acceptable unto God?


The child. By the means of faith: The way to do good works to gods pleasure
for through faith, a man is well assured in his conscience, that God will not
look narowly upon his works, nor try them by the sharp rygoure of his
justice: but that he will rather hyde the vnperfytnes and the unclean spots
that be in them, with the undefiled pureness of our savior Christ, and so
accoumpt them as perfect.


The minister. May we say then that a Christian manne is justified by his
works, after that God has called him, or that he does merit through them
Gods favor to the procurement of life everlasting?


The child. Psalm. 143.
No verily: but contrarywyse it is said, that no man living shall be justified
in Gods sight: and therefore it is our duty to pray that he do not enter
into judgment with us, or call us to a coumpte.


The minister. Thou meaneste not hereby that the good deeds of faithful men
are to no purpose and unprofitable?


The child. I mean nothing less: for god promyseth to reward them largely,
both in this world and in the life to come. And yet this notwithstanding,
those rewards of God be not given for the worthy deserts of our deeds, but
only because it pleases GOD of his goodness to love us freely, and so to cover
and forget our fautes, that he will never call them any more to remembrance.


The minister. Aright faith is never idle.
May we persuade our selves that we are just without good works, and without
the diligente applying of our selves to walk in all Gods holy
commandments?


The child. That is not possible: for to believe in Christ is as much to say,
what it is to believe in Christ.
as to receive Christ in such sort and with such properties, as he does give
himself unto us: now this is an evident thing, that Christ does not only
promise to deliver us from death, and to restore unto us the loving favor of
god his father through the only merits of his innocence: But also he promises
to make us new creatures, by his holy spirit, to the end that we should
lead a holy conversation in all good works.


The minister. Then I see, that it is so far from the office or workyng of
faith to make men despysers of good deeds, or negligent to live godly: that
it is the very root or lyuelye fountain, whereout all good works doesprynge.


The child. Ye say as the truth is, The effect of the gospel is faith and
repentance.
and for this cause the doctrine of the gospel does consyste in these two
points: faith and repentance.


The minister.


The child. It is and earneste dyspleasure to ward what repentance is.
sin, and therewith al a feruente desire or longyng for godliness, proceadyng
of the fear or God: and inducing us to the mortifying of our carnal
affectyons, inclining us altogether to the guiding and governance of the holy
ghost, to serve God unfeignedly.


The minister. This then which we have touched, is the second point of a
christen man's life which stands in seruyng of God.


The child. wherein the right seruinge of god sta^dyth.
Yea verily: and we have said also that the very right and alowable service of
God, does consyst in submyttyng our selves humbly unto him, studying earnestly
to do according to his will.


The minister. Wherefore stands gods service herin only?


The child. Because he will not be served or wurshipped after our fantasy and
imaginacion, but after his own good pleasure.


The minister. What rules or ordinances has he prescrybed unto us to lead
our life by?


The child. His law.


The minister. What things does yt conteyne?


The child. It is divided into.ii. parts, The law has two parts.
where of the first does contain four commandments, the second
contains.vi. so that there be.x. in the whole.


The minister. Who has made this division thereof?


The child. God himself: Exodus 32.34. Deu. 4.12
who also gave it written in two tables unto Moises saying, that the whole was
reduced into ten sentences.


The minister. What is the matter or substance of the first table?


The child. It touches the due manner of woorshyppyng God. The effect of the
first table.



The minister. What is contained in the second table?


The child. It shows us in what manner we ought to behave our selves toward
our neghboures, The effect of the second table
and what duetye we owe unto them.


The minister.


The child The first commandment. Exodus 20 Deu. 5
HEarke^, and take heed Israel: I am the lord thy God, which has brought
thee forth of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shall have
none other God before my face.


The minister. Declare the meaning hereof.


The child. It is a preface to begin withal, or an introduction to the whole
law: for he does challenge here unto himself, first authority to command,
naming himself everlasting, and the creator of the world: and again after he
calls himself our God, whereby he moves our hearts to have in reverence,
and to esteem highly his doctrine: for if that he be oursauior, it is good
reason that we be also his loving subjects, and obedient people.


The minister. what signifies the deliurance out of Egypt.
But that which follows after, touching the deliverance from the miserable
bondage of Egypt: is it not referred pecularely to the people of Israel?


The child. Yes verily, as concerning the deliverance from bodily bondage:
howbeit it belongs also generallye unto us all with out excepcio^, in so much
as he has delivered our souls from the spiritual captivity of sin, and
from the tira^ny of the devil and his kyngedome, whereof the bondage of Egypt
was but a figure.


The minister. Why does he make mention of this in the very beginning of his
law?


The child, It is done to put us in remembrance, how greatly we are bound to
show unto him al obedience in performyng of his will: and to sygnifye unto us
what ingratitude and unkindness it is to do the contrary.


The minister. And what is briefly the effect of that he requires of us, in
this first commandment?


The child. He enioyneth us to reserve unto him only the honor due unto him:
The sum of the first commandment.
and that in no wise we alienate or put it from him, giving the same unto any
other.


The minister. What is the honor due unto him alone?


The child. To worship him, The honor that is due to god alone.
to put our whole trust in him, to call upon hyma^d such other like, which be
attributed peculiarly and only unto his majesty.


The minister. Wherefore is that clause put to: before my face?


The child. For So Much as he sees and knows al things, and judges the
secret thoghtes of men's hearts: he signifies unto us, that he does not
account it sufficient if we make a countenance or be are a fair show before
me^, but that his will is that also in very deed, even from the bottom of our
heart, with fervent affection, we do take him for our only God.


The minister.


The child. The second commandment touching Images and the worshipping of
them.
Se thou make thee no graven image, neither any similitude of any thing, either
in heaven above, either in the earth beneath, or in the waters which be beneth
the earth: thou shall do no honor unto them nor wurship them.


The minister. Does he utterly forbydde the making of any images?


The child. No: but he does forbid expressly either to make any image thereby
to represente or figure god: either to make any image to wurshyppe yt.


The minister. Wherefore are we forbidden to make any figure or image of God?


The child. Because there is no similitude nor comparison between hi^ that is
an everlasting spirit, Deu. 4. Esa. 41. Rom.. 6. Acts 17.
not able to be conceived of the mind, nor possible to be seen with eyes, and
a material body mortal and apt to putrifye, which we may both feel and see.


The minister. Thy mi^de is then, that he does great dyshonor to Gods majesty,
that goth about to represent or figure him in such sort.


The child. Yea verily.


The minister What manner of adoracion is here inhibited?


The child. We are forbidden here to come before any image to make our
prayers, Of honor forbydde^ to images.
or to bow our knee before it, or to make any other semblant or token of
reverence: as though God were more present there, or showed forth his power
unto us more in that place, than else where.


The minister This is not then to be taken as though al keruyng or painting of
Images were utterly prohibited: but alonly to make any image to do God
service therewith, or thereby to wurship him in visible things: In what sort
images are forbidden.
either finallye to make any Image, whereby the simple may take occasion to
abuse it unto any kind of superstition or idolatry: all such are utterly
forbidden.


The child. It is even so.


The minister. For what purpose principally was this commandment given?


The child. In like manner as in the first commandment, God shows himself
to be alone the very same, unto whom all honor does belong: even so now in
this second commandment he goes about to withdraw us from all
superstitious kind of wurshipping, proceeding of our carnal imagitions.


The minister.


The child. He joins unto it a threatening saying: I am the eternal, your
God, almighty, Jealous, and punishing the wickedness of the fathers in their
children, unto the third and fowerth generation of such as do hateme.


The minister Wherefore does he make mention there of his might?


The child. To put us in remembrance that he is of sufficient ablenes to
uphold, maintayn and defend his honor.


The minister What means he by speaking of iealousy.


The child. He does us to wete, that he can not abide a companion with him,
for even as he has of his unspeakable goodness, freely given himself unto us:
in like manner also he chalengeth as duetye of our behalf, that we become
altogether his servants, wholly addycte and given to please him: and this is
the spiritual chastity which he looks for of our souls, that they be
dedicated unto him, and kept holy for him And contrarywyse, it is a very
spiritual whoredom, if our minds be alyenated, Thouching spiritual whorde^.
or any whitte withdrawn from him, to any kind of Idolatry, or supersticion.


The minister How ought this to be taken, that he punishes the tra^sgressyo^s
of the fathers in their children.


The child To pearce our hearts more depely, with the terror of his wrath,
who does not only threaten to punish the offenders, but also their seed
after them.


The minister What? is not this contrary unto the ryghteuousnes of God, to
punish the one for the others fault?


The child. How God punishes the fathers wickedness in the child.
If we do way and consider aryghte, the state whereunto the whole nature of man is brought by the fall of Ada^, it may be thought superfluous and more
then needs to move this doubt: for we are every one of us borne under the
curse of God, and the children of his wrath, so that we can not find fault
with God when he lets us alone and suffers us still to continue such as
we are of nature. Now as it is a sure toke^ of gods tender affection and
fauore toward his servants, when he does also enriche their children with
his manyfolde blessings: so likewise it is a most dreadful token of Gods
vengeance toward the wicked, when he suffers their ofspringe to contynewe
in their cursed state.


The minister. What says he more besides this?


The chlide To the end he might stir us also with tender love he says
moreover that he shows forth his aboundaunte mercy unto the thousand descent
of such as love him and keep his commandments.


The minister. Does he mean thereby, that the obedyence and holy conversation
of a faithful man shall be suffyciente to save his posterytie, althouge it be
naught and wicked?


The child. Not so: but the meaning thereof is, How God shows mercy to a
thousand generacions.
that he will in such sort show forth his beneficial goodness toward the
faithful, that for the favor he bears unto them, he will also be known unto
their children to be their God, not only midyng to prospere the^ here in
things of this world, but to saynctifie them also with the gifts of his
spirit, whereby they may become seruisable and ready to please him.


The minister. But this is not altogether a general rule, that the children of
the wicked be accursed: and contrarywyse faithful men's children blessed.


The child No: Romans 6.
for our Lord does reserve this liberty to himself always, to show mercy
unto the childerne of the wicked: and on the other part, he has not so bownd
his grace to the children of the faithful but that he may at his pleasure
reiecte whom he will: yet notwithstanding he does in such wise order these
things, that all me^ne may easily see, that he has not made this loving
promise for noght.


The minister. Wherefore does he rehearse here in the promise? to a thousand
descent, whereas in the threatnynge he made mention but of.iii. or four?


The minister. That is done to sygnifye, that God is of his own goodwill and
inclination, always more ready to use gentleness and fauourablenes, then
roughnes or rygour: according as he says of himself that he has a ready
inclinacion to do good, or to show mercy, Exodus 34. Psalm. 103.
and contrariwise slow unto anger.


The minister. The iii. commandment.



The chide. Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.


The minister What is the right understanding of that?


The child He does not only forbid to abuse and blaspheme the blessed name
of God by periurye: but forbyddeth as well al vain, Of oaths.
and superfluous oaths.


The minister. May a man then swear lawefully at any time?


The child Yea verily, when there is just occasion: that is to say, to
maintain the truth of a matter when the time shall require, and likewise to
keep and nouryshe brotherly charytye among us.


The minister, Does he dysproue no oaths but such as are made to the
hinderaunce of Gods honor?


The child. In one kind of oath he teaches us a general rule: to wete, that
we ought not swear at all: that is to say, that we may not call God to
wytnes, unless it be done with all humblenes of mind, having a reuerente fear
toward his majesty before our eyes, to the intent to glorify his name: for
even as it is holy, and of most worthy price, so it behooves us to take
diligent head, with what reverence we should name God.
that we do not in such sort name him, or call him to witness, that either we
may seem to pass lyghtelye of him our selves, either whereby other may take
occasion to have him in small reverence.


The minister How shall a man use his name with such due reverence?


The child If we do neither think nor speak of God, nor of his works, but
with all reverence and honor.


The minister. What follows this commaundeme^te.


The child. He adds unto it a threatnynge: that he will coumpt him that
uses his name irreuerenlye as a wicked malefactoure?


The minister. Seeing that God pronounces threatiningly in other places in a
generalite, that he will punish al transgressoures: what vehemencye is there
besides in these words?


The child. He does expressy declare hereby, in how great estymacion he has
the honor of his holy name: forsomuche as he says precysely, by euidente
words, that he can not abide that any man do use it irreverently, to the
intent we migth with so much the more careful dilygence have it in honor.


The minister.


The child. Remember to keep holy the sabbath day: six days shall thou
labor, The.iiii. commandment.
and do any neadfull work thou have to do? but the seventh day is the rest of
the lord thy God, thou shalt do no work that day, neither thou nor thy
son, nor thy daughter, neither thy seruante, nor thy handmayde, no not thine
ox, or ass, neither the stranger that is with in thy gates for in six
days God made heaven and earth, and all that is in them, but the seventh day
he rested, wherefore he has blessed the day of rest, and has dedicate it
peculiarly to himself.


The minister. Gives God in commandment that men shall travail six days
every week, and so rest the seventh?


The child. No, he does not precisely command it: but rather he does give
men leave to travail about their commen business for the time of six days,
and so makes a restraint only of the seventh, in the which he forbids to
labor.


The minister. Are we then bound by Gods commandment to refrain one day in
the week from al manner of labor?


The child This commandment has a certain special consideration in it:
for as touching the observation of bodily rest, it belongs to that part of
the old law which is called ceremonial, the which ceremonies, were utterly
abolished at the coming of Christ.


The minister Say thou then, that this commandment belongs peculyerly
unto the Jews, and that God did give it only for the time of the old
testament?


The child. Yea verily, as touching the ceremony thereof, and the outward
bodily rest to be observed therein.


The minister. Why then, is there any other thing contained in it besides the
ceremony?


The child. Yea truly: for there be three consyderacions, for the which this
commandment was given.


The minister. What are they?


The child. The first is, Three consideracions for the which the sabbath day
was ordained.
that it might be a figure to represente our spiritual rest: The second for a
comely order to be used in the church or congregation: And thirdely, for the
refreshyng of servants, that they might have some relief of their travail.


The minister What is that, thou call spiritual rest?


The child. That we cease to do the works of our own lusts and will, that
the lord may bring forth the works of his spirit in our hearts.


The minister How may we do this?


The child By mortifying our flesche and subduing the inordinate affections of
our nature, to the end that Gods spirit only may bear rule in us.


The minister. Are we bound to this rest but one day in the week?


The child. The spiritual Sabbath is co^tynuall.
It is our bounden duetye to continue in this rest always: so that when we have
once begone to enter in to it, we must go on forward whiles our life lasts.


The minister. How happens it then that there is but one day appointed to
represent and figure unto us a thing that dureth our whole life?


The child. It is not necessary that the figure or shaddowe of a thing do
rese^ble thoroughly in all points the thing it is ordained to represente: it
is to be thought suffyciente, if they agree and be like in son points.


The minister. And wherefore was the seventh day appointed rather then any
other?


The child. The number of seven The number of seven.
does sygnifie and importe a certain perfection in the holy scripture,
wherefore the seventh day was most meet to set out unto us a thing that
should still continue: moreover it puts us in remembrance that our
spiritual rest or quietness is not full nor perfect, whiles we live in this
world, neither shall it be absolutely brought to perfection until we depart
this life.


The minister.


The child When God had created al his works in six days, he dedicated or
appointed the seventh to the vewe and beholding of his workmanship. And to the
intent we might be the more easily induced to the consideration there of, he
brings forth his own exaumple, for that there is nothing of so much
worthiness to be desired, as to become like unto him.


The minister. Must we than daily have consideration and remembrance of gods
works: or is it enough to have mind of them one day in the week?


The child Verily our bound duty is to have both daily and hourly a
reverent consideracion of his merueillous works: We are bownde to praise God
continually in his works.
but for that we are through frailty so negligent and forgetful, there is one
certain day, peculiarelye appointed, to renew from time to time the
remembrance of this our duty, and that is the politic order which I spoke
of.


The child. What manner of order ought the people to observe in that day?


The child. As touching pollitique or dre for days.
They are bound that day to come together, and to give diligente ear to the
word of God, to make their prayers unto God, and finallye to make open
profession of their faith and religion.


The minister. What meanest thou by saying, that it was partly ordained for the
recreation and ease of servants?


The child To thintente that they which be under the authority and power of
others, might be released somewhat and lyghtened of their paynful labors, the
which thing also serves to the furtheraunce of the common wealth: for so much,
as every man has just cause to be the readyer willynglye to travail the other
six days, when they consider, that they may take their rest in the seventh.


The minister Go to then, let us now also see how this commandment
belongs unto us.


The child As touching the ceremony there of, Col. 2. The ceremonial Sabbot^
is ended.
we have nothing to do with it: for the use of al ceremonies ceased at the
cumming of Christ, who was the end and substance of them.


The minister. How so?


The child. For our old man, unto whom the ceremonies belonged, is now
crucified by the virtue of his death: Romans 6.
and through the merit of his resurrection we rise again into a newnes of life.


The minister. What is there than in this commandment that concerns us?


The child. We are bound to observe the politic order appointed in the
church for the hearing of Gods word, for cumming together to make common
prayers, and for the right use of the sacraments.


The minister And does the figure profytt us no more?


The child Yes verily: for it leadethe us to the truth of that thing, whereof
the sabbath day is a figure: which is, that we being made the true members of
Christ, ought to leave of from doing the works of our own will, and to
commit our selves wholly unto his tuicion and governance.


The minister.


The child. HOnor thy father and thy mother.


The minister The 5 commandment.
What do thou mean by this word, Honor?


The child what honor is due to our superiors.
The meaning is that children are of duetye bound to use humble obedience and
lowlynes, toward their father and mother, bearing a reuerente mind toward
them, ready to assyst and aid the^, and willing to do after their
commandments according to their duty.


The minister. Proceade farther in this commandment.


The child. God joins also a promise to this commandment, sayng, that thou
may lead a prosperous life many years in the land which the lord thy God
has given thee.


The minister. What is the meaning of this promise?


The child. That God will indue them with a long life here in this world,
which have their father and mother in due reverence.


The minister. How cummeth it to pass, that god promises man to prolong his
life here in this world (as if it were a special benefit) since this life
present is so full of al kind of misery?


The child. Though our life here in this world be never so full of
wretchedness, yet not with standing a long life A long life.
is a blessing of God unto the faithful: for somuche as god does show forth
his fatherly affection toward his in that they know they are under his
protection and defense?


The minister. May a man gather of the contrary part, that he who lives not
many years, is accursed of God?


The child. No: but rather it cummeth to pass many times, that our lord
takes them soneste of all out of this world, shortenyng their life, whom he
loves most dearly.


The minister. Since he does thus, It seems that he keeps not always
promise.


The child. Benefits of this world are promised with condition.
Yes verelye: for what promise soever god makes us, touching the benefits of
this world, we ought to take it with this condition, so farfurth as it shall be
expedient for the health of our soul. For it were a means to have the promise
of god in small reputacyon, if the eyes of our mind were not directed further
then to consider only the state of this present life.


The minister. And what is to be said of them that be disobedient unto father
and mother?


The child. The ponyshement of children which disobey their parents.
God will not only punish them with everlasting pain in the day of judgment,
but he will execute also, punishmente on their bodies here in this world:
either by shortnynge their life, either by procuring them a shameful death,
either at the least a life most miserable.


The minister. Does not God speak expressly and namely of the land of Canaan
in this promise?


The child. Yes verily, as touching the children of Israel, unto whom the
commandment was first given: but since it has pleased god to receive us also
into the noumbre of his people, Psalm. 14 Psalm. 88. Psalm. 3.
we must take it in a more general significatyon, so that, in somuche as the
whole earth is the lords, we ought to acknowledge that what countreye soever
we do inhabit, god has given unto us the same for a dwellinge place.


The minister. Is there nothing else to be understand in this commandment?


The child. Yes, for notwithstanding no mention is made in it expressly but of
the father and mother: yet we must understand in them, al magistrates, rulers,
and superiors, for so much as there is one manner of consideracion of them
all.


The minister. What is that?


The child. AS God has given unto them all, their authority and preeminence:
and because there is no prerogative of superioritye, neither of father nor
mother, neither of prince, or ruler, magistrate, or master, neither any other
office or title of preemynence, Romans 13.
but such as God has ordained: therefore they require al by one manner of
reason their due obedience.


The minister.


The child The.6. commandment.
THou shall do no murder.


The minister. Is there nothing forbidden here but open murder?


The child. Yes verelye: for considering that it is god who gives this in
commandment, the which has chief regard unto our hearts: he does not
only give us a law to restrain our outward deeds, but principally to bridle
the affections of our mind.


The minister. Thy meaning is then, that there is a certain kind of murder
lying prieuelye in the heart, the which is forbidden here of God.


The child. It is even so: and that is a malicious hatred or rancour, and a
desyer to do hurt unto our neighbor.


The minister. Is it enough then if we bear no hatred nor malice toward any
man?


The child. No, for in that, that god forbyddeth hatred, it is to be
understand also that he requires of us to love all men, and that unfeignedly
from the bottom of the heart, procuryng by all means, their wealth.


The minister. Rehearse the seuenthe commandment.


The child THou shall not commit adultery. The.7. Co^ma^dement.



The minister. What is the sum and effect of this commandment?


The child. All whoredom is declared to be accursed of God, Al whordome is
accursed:
and therefore it behooves us to refrain from it if so be we fear to provoke
his wrath against us.


The minister. Is there no other thing contained in this commandment?


The child. We must al ways have an eye and a regard to the lawmaker, The
mind of the law maker is to be considered.
who in so much as he is God, from whom nothing lies hid: he stays not
himself in the consideracion of the outward work, going no farther, but he
requyrethe also that the heart be clean from al corruption and lust.


The minister. Show me then, what is the full and perfect meaning of this
commandment.


The child. 1. Cor. 3.
Forsomuche as our bodies and souls are the temples where Gods holy spirit
rests, 2. Cor. 6.
this commandment requires of us, to keep the^ in all honest pureness: in
such sort that it is not enough for us, if we be chaste as touchi^g the
carnal act, but we must also be without all uncleanly lusts or desires,
without all inordinate fansyes: finally we are inhibyted all words and
gestures which sound or allure to uncleanliness, so that there must be no part
in us, defiled, or unchaste.


The minister.


The child. The.6. commandment.
Thou shall not steal.


The minister. Does this commandment forbydde only such robberies as be
punished by common laws, either does it reach any farther to any other kind
of stealyng?


The child. This commandment reaches unto al naughty, unlawful, Of theft.
or disceauable occupacyons, and forbids all disalowable or discommendable
ways and means, whereby we pluck unto us any part of our neighbors
substance, whether it be by violence, by fraud, or by any other means, that
God has not allowed by his word.


The minister. Is it enough if a man refrain from the deed doing, either is
it forbidden also to mind or purpose any such thing?


The child. We must al ways have a consyderacion that God was the maker of
this law: Of inward theft.
who for so much as he is a spirit, has not only regard to robberies that be
committed in deed, but he considers as well our secret enterprises, our
deuyses, and purposes, and the desires of our mind, to come by riches through
our neighbors loss.


The minister. What behooves it us then to do?


The child. We are bound to do our endeavor that every man may have his due
and right,


The minister. What is the nynth commandment?


The child. The ninth co^maundemete.
Thou shall bear no false wytnes against thy neighbor.


The minister. Does god forbid in this commandment, open periurye before a
judge only: either are we charged to make noe lie to the dysprofyte of our
neighbors?


The child. A general doctrine towchi^g other.
In namynge one kind of lying, he forbids utterly to make any leasyng:
meaning that we may not speak any thing to the reproach of our neighbor
falselye: and that we may in no wise backbyte him or make lies of him, whereby
he might sustain loss in his goods, or be hyndered in his good name.


The minister. Wherefore does he speak expressly of open periuryes, rather then
of any other kind of lies?


The child. To the intent that we might the more earnestly deteste, and
abhor, After customable stau^deryng and liing: there follows shor ely in the
neck of it open perjury.
al backbiting, and lying: signyfying unto us withal, that whosoever does
accustom himself to speak sla^derously of his neighbor, or to make any lie
to his neighbors, hinderaunce privily, he will not be ashamed shortly after to
forswear himself openly.


The minister. Be slanderous and lying words forbidden here alone: either be
we also restrained from al evil thynkinge?


The child. As well the one as the other by the reason which we have already
aleged, That that is ill to be done before men, yt ill to be though before God.
for that that is evil in the doing before men: is as evil to be willed or
thought before God.


The minister. Rehearse then in few words the very sense and meaning of it.


The child. We are taught by this commandment, not to be ready to judge
evil, or to speak any words that sound to the reproach and infamy of
others: but much rather to have a good opinion of our neighbors, and to
speak words to their praise, and to the mayntenaunce of their good fame, and
honest estymacion, so far forth as the truth will bear us.


The minister.


The child. The.x. commandment.
Thou shalt not desire thy neighbors house: thou shall not desire thy
neighbors wife, nor his servant, nor his maid, nor his ox, nor ass,
neither any thing that is thy neighbors.


The minister. Seeing the whole law is spiritual, and requires pureness of the
heart (as thou have said) and forsomuche as every one of the other before said
commandments were ordained, as well to correct and amend the naughtye
rebellyous affections of the heart, as to rule and govern the outward
doings of men, it appears that this commandment is superfluous, and that
there was enough said before.


The child. In the above rehearsed commandments, God forbyddeth all willing
or consenting to do evil, minding thereby to brydell and suppress all rooted
affections, or deliberate purposes of naughtines: but here in this he utterly
inhybiteth all evil thoughts, light mocions, sudden affections, yea though
we never fully purpose them, neither endeavor our selves, or consent
wyllyngly to do them.


The minister. Say thou then, that the least mocion or temptacion that can
enter into the thought of a faithful man is sin, though he utterly refuse
it, strive against it, and will not by any means consent unto it?


The child. Yea verily: for this is certain, that al wanton thoughts and
mocions of evil, Every evil mocion is a sin.
do proceade and spring out of the orygynall sin which contynueth still in
us by nature: whereof I conclude that lusts or mocions which do kendle or
stir up man's heart to do amysse, though he never purpose or consent to do
the thing, be nevertheless directly against this commandment.


The minister. This is then bryefely thy saying, that even as lusts or
desires of evil, which have so far prevailed, that the will is consenting
and fully agreed upon the same, are reproved as sin in the former
commandments: even so by this commandment God requires of us such an
vpryghte clearenes of conscience that there may not so much as one evil
mocion or desire, once enter into our hearts, the which might enclyne or
provoke us to do amysse.


The child. Ye have said all.


The minister. May we not now make a brief some and gatheringe of the whole
law?


The child. The sum and effect of the whole law. Matt. 22.
Yes verily, the whole law is comprehended in these. ii. points: the one is,
that we love God with all our heart, with all our mind, and with our whole
might. The other is that we love our neighbor as our self.


The minister. What is included in the love of God?


The child. It requires of us this duetye, that we love him as our God: that
we acknowledge and take him for our sovereign lord, master, savior and
father: so that hereby our duetye is to fear him, to honor him, to put our
whole trust in him, to obey him and love him.


The minister. What do thou mean by these words: with all our heart,
all our mind, and our whole strength.


The child. It is no more to say, but that we must love God with such a zeal
and feruente affection, that there may be in us, no desire, no will, no
thought, no endeavor, no manner of inclynacion, contrary unto this love.


The minister. What is the meaning of the second point?


The child. We are taught thereby, that as we be naturally inclyned to love our
selves, and as this affection is most vehemente and does pass all the rest,
even so our love toward our neighbors, ought in such sort to bear rule
in our hearts: that it should rule and guide us altogether, and should be a
line and rule, thereby to order all our thoughts and deeds.


The minister. And whom meanest thou, when thou say our neighbors.


The child. I do not only sygnyfye by the word our kindred, friends, and
such other as be of our familier acquaintance: but such also as be strangers
unto us, and more then that, our very enemies.


The minister. In what band or alliance are we in with them?


The child. There is a knot of frendshyp the which God himself has fastened,
which cannot be loosed by any man's malice, or wickedness.


The minister. Then thou will say, if any man bear any malycious hatred unto
us, that evil affection comes of himself: and yet in the mea^e time, by the
very order which God himself has appointed, he ceasseth not to continue still
our neighbor, and we are bound even so to take him.


The child. Yea verily.


The minister. Seeing the law requires such a perfect upright manner of serving
God, is not every christen man bound to frame his life and conuersacyon after
the same?


The child. Yes truly, but we have in us so much weakness; No man can fulfill
the law.
that there is no man which fully does perform all that the law requires.


The minister. Why does God therefore require of us such an exquisite
perfection as we be not hable to reach unto?


The child. God requires nothing of us but that which we are bound to do,
and our own consciences witness that we are charged with already: And again if
we bend our selves, and give diligence to frame our lives to this rule set
forth in the law, than albeit we be far from being able to attain unto the
perfection thereof, yet the lord will not lay to our charge that defaut or lack
of dooyng the same as our duty requires.


The minister. Speak thou generally of al men: either else meanest thou the
faithful only?


The child. I speak not of such as believe not, for no man is able to begin to
frame himself to do the least poyncte that the law requires, until he be
regenerate and fashyoned again through the spirit of God. Moreover, if it
were possible to find out any manne who were able to perform some part of
that, Deu. 27 Gal. 3.
that the law demands, it should not be enough to dyscharge him before god:
for the lord pronounces openly this sentence, that whosoever does not
thoroughly accomplish every point contained in the law, is accursed.


The minister.


The child. Romans 3. To what use the law serves touching the vnfeythful 2.
Cor. 3.
What else? for as touching them that believe not, it serves to no other
purpose but to reprove and condemn them, and to take from them al manner
occasion to excuse themselves before god: and this is that part of the office
of the law, which. S. Paul speaks, of, namyng it the instrumente of death
and damnacio^: but as touching the faithful, it serves to an other use.


The minister. What profit does the law bring to the faithful?


The child, To what use the law serve the as touchin the feithfull.
First the law makes it known unto them, that they cannot be justified by
their works: and so by humbling them through the knowledge of their miserable
state, it does stir them to search their health and salvation in our savior
Christ. Secondarily whereas it requires more then is possible for any man to
do, it warns them to pray unto God, that he will vouchsafe to give them
suffyciente strength that they may at least have a ready willing mind to obey
his will, and thereby they have also occasion to knowledge their daily fautes,
and so to think lowely of them selves: Thyrdelye it serves them in stead of
a bridle, to repress their carnal affections, and to hold them fast in the
fear of God.


The minister. We may then finally conclude, as touching this matter, that
albeit for the time of this transitory life, we never attain to be able to
render perfect obedience unto the law, yet it is not to be thought a vain
thing, and to no purpose, that it requires of us such a precyse and exquisite
perfection: for thereby it sets up a mark unto us, to the e^d, that we
every one, according to the grace wherewith God has endued us, might
continually with so much more feruente affection, walk toward it and study
daily more and more to come unto it.


The child. Ye have uttered the thing even as I meant it.


The minister. Have we not a perfect rule of all rigthtuousnes set out in the
law?


The child. Yes verelye: so that God demands no other thing of us,
Obedience to the law is gods only service, and the sacrifice that he requires
of us. 1. Sam. 15. Ierem. 7.
then to frame and order al our doings by it: and contrary wise God disaloweth
and refuses whatsoever man takes in hand to do besides, For obedience is the
only sacrifice and service, which he requires.


The minister. To what purpose then does al those monicions, declarations,
exhortations, and commandments serve, which the Prophets make and the
apostles?


The child. The doctrine of the prophets and Apostles be nothing else but
exposicions of the self same law more at large, the end of which doctrine is
so far of from the leadyng of us from the obedience due unto God, that it is
rather in stead of a sure gyde to conduct us, and bring us unto it.


The minister. Yet it seems that the law does not set out every man's
particular vocation and office.


The child. Where as the law of God prescrybeth that we ought to render unto
every man that, that is his due, we may right well gather thereof, what
every man's duty is in his state and calling: further (as we have already
said) the residue of the scripture makes a more particular and plain
declaration of the same: for the self same things which God has in few
words comprehended in these tables of his commandments, other parts of the
scripture do entreat here and there more at large.


The minister. The iii. poincte towching the true honoring of God, is calling
on him in our need.
let us speak now also of the third point touching the honor which he
demands of us.


The child. We have said here before that the third manner of honor which he
demaaundeth of us, is to call upon him and to seek for help at his hand in all
our nedos.


The minister, Do thou mean, that this honor, to call upon God for help in
our necessities, is due unto him alone?


The child. Yea, for he chalengeth this as a peculiar honor due unto his
high and divine majesty only.


The minister. Since it is so: after what forte is it lawefull for us to
require succor at man's hand?


The child. There is great dyfference between those two things: for we call
upon the name of God, to protest and signifye, that we look for no help nor
benefit but at his hand, having our whole affyance in him, as a sure rock,
and in none else: yet in the mean time we procure and use the help of men
and other creatures, so far forth as God gives us leave, and as he has
lent the^ ablenes and means to succor us.


The minister. Thou meanest then, that to demand succor of man, is no whit
contrary to this that we are bound to make our inuocacio^ and prayer only
unto God for help: for so much as we put not our trust in them, neither seek
their succor, but so far for the as God has ordained them minysters, and
bestowers of his goods to our necessity, and comfort.


The child. Ye say very well: and in very deed, what soever benence or
frendshyp we receive at any man's hand, we are bound so to take it, as if God
himself did deliver it unto us: for the truth is that it is he, who sends
all such benefits by the hands of his creatures.


The minister Is it not then our duetye to give thanks unto men for their
benefits, and to acknowledge gentilye their fre^delye help, saying the law
of nature so teaches?


The child. Yes verily, and it were for no more but for that it has pleased
God to call them to such honor, as to be the dealers, and distributers of his
benefits: for God in so doig, does bind us unto them, and will that we take the
same thankefullye at their hands, but yet always so, that we must acknoweldge
that they are but his ministers and alms dealers, and that he alone is the
prouyder of all.


The miister It appears by this that we may not call upon Angels or
Saints departed for help.


The child. You say truth: for touching saints departed, Neither Angels
nor saints departed are to be called upon for any help.
God has not appointed unto them any such office, as to help us, or given
them any such charge as to ministre unto our needs. And as concerning his
angels, although he have ordained the^ as ministers to serve for our health,
yet is it nothing less then his will that we should call upon them for help,
either have our recourse and refuge unto them in time of need.


The minister. Thou supposest the^, that whatsoever is not agreeable to the
order which God has set forth unto us, is repugnaunte vino his will.


The child I mean eue^ so: for if so be that we will become so curious, as
not to content our selves with that order and manner of doing which God has by
his word set forth unto us: that is a token most certain of infidelity.
Moreover, if in stead of seeking upon God alone for help in all our needs, we
shall have recourse unto Angels or any other creatures, puttinge any part of
our confyde^ce or trust in them: we commytte therein damnable Idolatry, by
atiributyng unto the, that thing which ought to be peculiarelye reserved unto
God.


The minister. Of prayer.
either is a fervent mind, and earnest affection of the heart also necessarily
required?


The child As for the speaking with the tongue is one of the least points,
neither is it always necessary to use the tongue in praying: but an attentife
mind, and earnest affection is always necessaryly required.


The minister. How prove you that?


The child. For, somuche as God is a spiritual substance, he requires
always the spirit, we must pray with in hearty affection.
and the heart: and as at al other times, so specially in time of prayer, when
we show our selves in his presence, and enter into communication wih him:
Psalm. 145. Esa. 29. They are cursed of God that pray without hearty affection.
and thereupon he makes a restrainte of his promise, saing that he will be at
hand, to hear only all them which call upon him in truth: contrary wise he
pronu^ceth all the accursed which pray hipocritically or without an earnest
affection.


The minister I see then thereby that al such prayers as be made only with the
mouth, be unprofitable and to no use.


The child They be not only unprofitable, but they are superfluous and
provoke God to dipleasure.


The minister. What manner of affection is required to make the prayer
acceptable?


The child. We must first of al have such a feeling of our poverty and
wretchedness, that we may perceive an earnest vexacion and grief of mind,
through the lothsommes of sin, or lack of some grace expedient for us: we
must also have a feruente desire and longing to obtain the same at gods hand,
which desire must kendle out hearts, and enge^der in us a ferue^te prayer.


The minister. Do these things proceed of our nature, either are they given
unto us by the special goodness of God?


The child. It is God that plays the workman: for we are of our selves
dull, and without al lust to prayer: but the spirit of God does styre up in
our hearts such syghes as no tongue is able to express, Romans 8. Gal. 4.
and endueth our mi^des with such a zeal, and feruente affection, as God
requires in prayer.


The minister. Does this doctrine teach us that we ought not to dispose, and
stir up our selves to prayer?


The child. Nothing less: but rather contrary wise, so often as we do not
feel in our selves such a devotion, or disposition to prayer, we ough to make
our supplication unto the lord, that it will please him to give us of his
grace, whereby we may be framed to prayer with such affection of mind as we
ought to do.


The minister. As touching the use of the tongue, The tongue serves to a very
good use in the making of our prayers.
thou do not count it utterly unprofitable in making of prayers?


The child No verily: for the words which the tongue utters do many times
help to comfort, and to stir up the affections of the mind: yea they do
strengthen, and hold in the mind of man, whereby his thought does not wander
so sodaynely from GOD, as otherwise it would: moreover, for somuche as the
tongue is a creature of GOD, ordained of him to praise and set forth his glory,
above al other members of the body, it is reason and duetye, that the tongue
be employed by all means to that use: finally the very feruente affection of
the heart does many times through a vehement mocion, enforce the tongue to
speak, though a man did not purpose so to do.


The minister, Since it is as thou say, to what purpose is it to pray in a
langage that a man does not understand? To pray in a strange language is a
mocking of God. 1. Cor. 14.



The child. It is to mock God withal, and a supersticious hypocrisy.


The minister.


The child. Prayer must proceed of a sure confydence in gods promysse.
We must have this evermore as a sure foundation and ground in all our prayers,
that they shall be accepted of God, and that we shall obtain our request so
farforth as it shall be expedient and necessary for us: where upon, Romans 10.
Saint Paul says, that the right invocation and prayinge unto God,
proceeds of faith: for if we have not a sure affiance and trust in the
bountyfull mercy of God, it is impossible to make our prayer unto him aryghte.


The minister. What say thou then of them which be in doubt and uncertain
whether God will hear them or not? Matt 12. Mark. 11. whosoever doubts
whether God hear his prayer, obtaynethe nothing.



The child Their prayers are utterly void and nothing worth: neither has
God made any promise to any such prayers, for he says: what soever we shall
ask, if we believe, he will grant it unto us.


The minister. There is nothing now behind but to know by what means, and
in whose name we may come by this sure confidence to present our selves
before God considering that we are vile sinners, Three things make us bold to
ask of God 1. His promise Psalm. 50.91.145. Esa. 30.65. Iere. 29.
and far unworthy so to do.


The child. First of al we have promises of God whereupon we must stay our
mi^des, without having any regard of our own worthynes: Secondaryly then,
(if we be the children of GOD) he does induce us, and pusshe us forward with
his holy spirit, 2. His spirit. Joel. 2. Mat. 6.
to the entente to allure us to be familier with him as with our loving
father: and finally to the end that we should not be afraid to come before
his glorious majesty, 3. The mediacion of Christ his own son 1. Tim. 2.
Hebru. 4. 2. Ihon. 2.
although we be but as poor woormes of the earth, and most wretched sinners,
he has given unto us our Lord JESUS to be our peacemaker and intercessoure,
to the intent that we by means of his merits having recourse unto God our
father, might have an assured trust to find grace at his hand.


The minister Do thou mean it thus, that we may not call upon God by prayer,
unless it be done in the name of our savior Christ?


The child we may not pray but in the name of our Savior Christ. Ihon. 14.
Yea, I mean it even so: for we have an express commandment so to do: and in
so doing we have a sure promise, that through his merytes and intercession,
al our requests shall be granted unto us.


The minister. Is it not then to be taken as a point of rash boldenes or
folyshe presumpcion, to come forth hardely, and to present our selves before
God himself, assuryng our selves that we have our savior Christ for our
advocate, and to set him before us, to the end that God may for his sake
accept both us and our prayers?


The child. No verily: for we make our prayers as it were by his own mouth,
Romans 8.
for so much as he himself opens the way for us, and makes our prayers to
be heard, yea and entreats also continually for us.


The minister.


The child. If we shoold follow our own will and fantasye in making our
prayers, they should be very vnhansomlye framed. For we are so blind that we
are not able to judge what is good and meet to be prayed for: moreover, al
our desires are so inordinate, and repugnaunte to Gods will, that it is
expediente for us to bridle them, and keep them under.


The minister What is then to be done?


The child. We must learn of God what is mete to be prayed, for seeing he
alone knows what is necessary for us: and that he leads us as it were by
the hand, so that we our own selves do nothing but follow.


The minister What instruction has he given us for prayer?


The child. He has taught us sufficiently how and wherefore to pray,
throughoute the whole scripture, but to the intent to bring us to one certain
and sure mark, he has set forth unto us one manner of prayer, wherein he has
brieflye comprehended all such points as be meet or lawful for us to
demand.


The minister. Rehearse that form of prayer.


The child. It is the very same that our Lord Jesus taught his discyples to
pray: Mat. 6. Luke. 11.
for wha^ they asked of him how they should pray, he answered that they should
say on this wise.

The faithful prayer which our lord himself taught us.
OVre father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy
will be done in earth as it is in heaven, give us this day our daily
bread, forgive us our trespaces, as we for give them, that trespass against
us: and lead us not into temptacion, but deliver us from evil. For thine is
the kingdom, the power and the glory world without end. So be it.


The minister. For the more easy understanding hereof, tell me how many
articles or particular requests be contained herein?


The child. Six, The division of the lords prayer.
of which the.iii. first do concern the glory of God, without any respect
or consideration of our selves: the other, iii. touch us properlye, and
concern our wealth and profit.


The minister. Why then, ought we to desire any thing of God, that brings no
manner of commodity unto our selves?


The child This is true, that God of his infinite goodness does dispose and
order all things in such sort, that nothing can turn to the glory of his
name which is not also profitable unto us: so that when his name is saynctyfyed
and honored, he makes it redounde to our sanctyfycacion: and when his
kingdom comes, we are after a sort partakers thereof: yet notwitsta^dinge,
our duetye is at such time as we ask and desire these things, to have only
regard to his honor, without any consideration to our selves, or to our own
commodity and profit.


The minister. By thy saying then, though these.iii. first peticions are
greatly profitable to us, yet we may not make them for any other purpose, but
only to desire to have God glorified and honored.


The child It is even so: and likewise, albeit the three first requests be
ordained to pray for things expedient and necessary for us: yet even in them
also we ought most earnestly to seek gods honor, so that it must be the
chief end and mark whereunto all our wisshinges and desires be dyrrected.


The minister.


The child. Since in time of prayer specially we ought to have a strong
confydence and a steadfast assureaunce of Gods favor in our consciences: In
what sense we call God father.
it pleases God to be called of us by a name which sounds nothing but al
swetenes, bou^tye, and mercifulnes, thereby to drive away all doubtfulnes, and
fear, and to make us conceive a bold courage to come familyarelye into his
presence.


The minister. May we then come boldlye and familiarely unto god, even as a
child may unto his father?


The child. Yea, and with a great deal more assured confidence to obtain
whatsoever we shall desyer: for if we being evil, Mat. 7.
cannot chose but give unto our children bread and meat when they ask it:
how much less can our heavenly father refuse to give us such things as we
have need of, since he is not alonelye good, but the very souerain goodness it
self?


The minister. May we not prove sufficientlye by this that God is named our
father, the same thing which we affyrmed touching Christ, that our prayer
ought to be grounded upon sure trust in his merits and intercession?


The child. Yes certainly, for god does acknowledge us no otherwise to be his
children, but only insomuch as we be the members of his dear son.


The minister. Wherefore do thou not rather call God thy father, than our
father, as it were in common?


The child, why we call him our father
Every faithful man may right well call God his father particularelye: but in
this form of prayer our savior Christ does teach us to pray in common, that
we might remember thereby the duty and charity which we owe to our
neighbors in our prayers, and to monishe us, not to care only for our
selves.


The minister. What means this clause? which art in heaven.


The child. It is as much to say, as to name him high, mighty, and of a
majesty incomprehensible.


The minister. To what purpose serves that?


The child. It serves to this end, that when we call upon him by prayer, we
might learn to lift up our minds, and to withdraw our imaginacyon from
thynking any thing of him wordly or earthly, and that we should not measure
him by our fleshly judgment, and so make him subject or appliable to our will
or appetyte, but rather that we might, with all humblenes of mind honor his
excelle^te majesty, and also that we might have occasion to put so much the
more our trust assuredlye in him, considering that he is Lord and master of
all.


The minister.


The child.


The minister. Do thou mean that this his glory may either increase or
dymynyshe?


The child. No verelye, in it self: In what sense we wyshe the setting forth
of gods glory.
but the meaning hereof is: that it may be known as it ought to be, and that
all the works which God does, may appear unto men to be glorious and
worthy of high praise, even as they be in very deed, so that he might by all
means be magnifyed.


The minister. request by the kingdom of God?


The child. This kingdom consysteth pryncypallye in two points: wherein the
kingdom of God consists.
that is to say, first in that he guydeth and governs his elect through his
holy spirit. And again in that he destroys and brings to utter shame and
confusion the wicked which will not become subjects to his kingdom, to the
end that it may euidentlye appear that there is no power hable to withstand
his incomparable might.


The minister. What understand thou in praying that this kingdom may come?


The child. The meaning is, that it will please god from day to day to
increase the number of his faithful flock, The kingdom of Christ.
that he will continually more and more show forth his favor in bestowyng the
gifts of his holy spirit among them, until the time come, in which they
shall be fullye replenished: that it may also please him to cause the light of
his truth more and more to shine amongst us: that he will in such wise make
his justice to be known, that the devil and his kingdom of darkness may
come to utter confusion, and that all wickedness may be clean abolished, and
rooted out.


The minister. Is nor this request performed in this world?


The child. It is partly fulfilled already: The perfeict state of Christ's
kingdom
yet our duty is to desire that it may be continually increased, and that he
will auaunce still and further his kingdom, unto such time as it shall come at
length to full perfectyon the which thing shall be at the day of judgment,
what time God alone shall be magnifyed, and all creatures shall appear low,
being subject unto his majesty, 1. Cor. 15.
yea when he shall be euydentlye seen to be all in all things.


The minister.


The child. I desire that al creatures may be ready and willing to obey him,
in such sort, The third request towching the acco^plishement of gods will
that what soever, is done may be pleasant to him.


The minister. Do thou mean then, that nothing may be done contrary unto
his will and appoyntemente?


The child. Our request is not only that he will bring al things to pass as
he has appointed by his unsearchable counsel and prouydence: but that it may
please him also to beat down all rebellion, that every man may with a
cherefull courage apply himself to his will only.


The minister. In so doing, do we not renounce and utterly refuse our own
wills?


The child. Yes forsooth: and we pray not only that it may please him to
ouerturne, make void, and bring to naught such desires as be in us repugnyng
unto his pleasure: Regeneracion.
but that he will also in such sort fashion our minds a new, and so frame
the affections or lusts of our hearts, that the work of our own will being
set a part, his spirit may work such a will in us, as may be in all points
agreeable unto him.


The minister. Wherefore put thou unto it, In earth as it is in heaven?


The child. Because the Angels which be his heavenly creatures, study nothing,
How gods will is done in heaven.
but quietly to please him, without any mocion or thought to the contrary: we
desire that the like may be done in the earth, and that al men may be framed
unto a like willing obedience.


The minister.


The child. That word contains al things whereof we have need in this
present life, what is meant by our daily bread.
not only as touchi^ng meat, dri^ke, and clothes, but all manner of things
that god knows to be expedient for us in this world, whereby we may have the
fruicion of his benefits in quietness.


The minister. Why beggest thou of god thy daily nouryshement, since he has
given a charge unto al men to get their living with the labor of their
hands?


The child. Albeit we are commanded to travail and do our endeavor, yet the
truth is so, that al our labor, diligence, and provision, that we can make,
is not able to procure us a living: but the only blessing of God upon our
hands and travail, which prospers the things we go about in his name:
moreover this is to be considered, that it is not meat or drink that
nourysheth us, (notwithstanding we be commanded to make provision for those
things) but the power of god mayntayneth our life, Deu. 8.
and we use them only as instruments.


The minister. Why call thou it, our bread, since we desire that it may be
given us?


The child. That cummeth of the only bountifulnes of God, whose pleasure it
was to name it ours, albeit it is nothing at al due unto us: and again by
this word we are put in remembrance not to desire the bread that an other
man has travailed for: but to wyshe that only which we shall come by, by
honest and lawful means, agreeable to gods ordinance.


The minister. Why say thou, this day: calling it our daily bread?


The child. wherefore we call it daily bread.
Those words do give us monicion to be contented, and not to wyshe more then
suffyseth for our necessity.


The minister. Seeing this is a common prayer belongyng indifferently to all
men: how is it that the rich (who have provided abundance of goods for a
long time) may make this petycyon for one day?


The child. All men both rich and poor must understand, that what goods
soever they have, they can nothing profyt them, but so far forth as it pleases
God to give the^ the use thereof, and the enioyinge of them: so that when we
have plentye yet we have nothing, onles he of his goodness give us also the
fruicion and use of the same.


The minister.


The child.


The minister. Is there any man living so just, that needs not to make this
request?


The child. No surely: for our Lord Jesus prescrybed this form of prayer to
his Apostels for the behofe of his whole church: so then whosoever would
exempte or privilege himself from the saying of this prayer, in so doing he
refuses to be of the company and fellowship of Christ's flock: and in very
deed the scripture does plainly testify, that the most perfect manne that
is, Job. 9.
if he would allege one point to iustifye himself thereby before God,
should be found fautye in a thousand: it is mete therefore that every man
have a recourse co^tinuallye unto the well of Gods mercy.


The minister. After what sort think thou that our sins be pardoned us?


The child. In what sort our sins are forgeuen.
Even as the very words of Christ do sound: for so much as our sins be as
debtes by which we are holden fast bond under the danger of everlasting
damnacion, we make supplycacyon unto GOD that he will of his mere goodness
pardon them.


The minister. Thou meaneste then, that we obtain forgeuenes of our sins by
the free mercy of God only.


The child. It is even so for we can by no means make amends for the least
fault that we have committed, if God did not use his bountiful lyberalytie
toward us, by for geuynge them freely every one.


The minister. What profit comes to us by that that we are pardoned of our
sins?


The child. Besides that, that we are delivered thereby from the pains of
hell, we become as acceptable unto God, as if we were innocent, and without al
spot of unrighteousness, and also our consciences be surely persuaded that he
bears a tender fatherlye affection toward us, whereby we attain to
everlasting health and felycytye.


The minister. When thou make thy prayer, that he will pardon us our offenses,
even as we pardon them which trespass against us: do thou mean hereby that
we merit or deserve to have our sins forgeuen in that, that we forgive
other men their fautes?


The child. No verily: for by that means we should not have pardon of our
sins Our sins be pardoned freely.
freelye and for naught, neither should the remyssyon of them be suffycientlye
grounded upon the satysfaction which was made in the death of Christ, as it
ought to be: but in that that we forgette the wrongs and damnages done unto
us, we follow his exaumple in gentleness and meekenes. And now to declare that
we are his children, he has given us this as a mark or badge to be known by,
and to certyfye our selves that we are so: on the other part also, he does us
to wete, that we may look for nothing at his judgment, but extreme and
rigorouse handlynge, if we will not, as his children show our selves ready to
pardon, and show favor unto them which be in debte, danger, and fault
toward us.


The minister. who^ god refuses to count as his children.
Thou meanest then, that GOD here refuses to take them for his children, which
cannot forget wrongs and trespasses committed against them: to the entente
they should not think themselves to be partakers of that mercy and favor
which the faithful do look for.


The child. Yea verily: and also to the end that all men might have
knoweledge that the self same measure which they meat unto other, shall be
paid unto them again.


The minister.


The child.


The minister. Make thou but one request of this?


The child. No, for the second part does expound the first.


The minister. What is the pyth and substance of this peticion?


The child. We desire that God do not suffer us to fall to wickedness, Roma. 7
neither permyt us to be overcome of the devil, nor to be lead with the
naughtye lusts of our flesh, which continually war against us: but that
he will give unto us power to withstand them, holding us up with his hand,
and keeping us al ways in his sauegarde, to be our protector and guide.


The minister. By what means is this brought to pass?


The child. What time God does guide us by his holy spyryte, thereby causynge
us to love goodness, and to hate evil, to seek after ryghteousnes, and to fly
from sin: for he makes us by his holy spyrite, able to overcome the devil,
sin, and the fles he.


The minister. Has every man need thus to be guyded?


The child. 1. pet. 5
Yea every man: for the devil watches continuallye for us, even as a roaringe
Lion, ready to devout us: and we on the other part be so feeble and frail,
that he would out of hand overcome us, if God did not both strengthen us
and give us the victoire.


The minister. What signifies this word, temptacyon?


The child. The wilye guiles and subtle assaults of the devil, what is
temptacion.
wherewith he assaulteth us and goes about to entrap us: who knows full
well, that we are naturally apt to be deceived, yea ready to deceive our
selves: and our will is wholly bente to do evil, and no whitte to do good.


The minister. But wherefore requireste thou of God that he do not induce and
lead us into evil: since that is an office belonging peculiarly to the devil?


The child. Even as God of his infinite mercy does preserve his faithful,
not sufferyng the devil to lead them out of the way, neither permyttynge
that sin have the upper hand of them: so likewise he does not only give
up, cast of, and withdraw his grace from such as his pleasure is to punish:
but also he delyuereth them to the devil, commyttyng them unto his tyranny: he
strikethe them with blindness and gives them up into reprobate minds that
they be come utterly slaves unto sin and subject to all temptacions.


The minister. What means the clause which follows? for unto thee belongs
the kingdom, power and glory, world withouc end.


The child. It puts us again in remembrance, that our prayers be
grounded upon God, and upon his almyghtye power and goodness, and not in any
thing that is in us: since we of our selves be unworthy once to open our
mouths to call upon him: again we are taught hereby to conclude or end all
our prayers in the lauding and praysyng of his power and goodness.


The minister.


The child Albeit we are not forbidden to use other words and to frame them
also after another sort, yet there can no prayer be acceptable unto God,
unless it be in effect and sense framed after this, which is unto us (as it
were) a perfect rule whereby to pray as we ought to do.


The minister. The fowrth kind of honor due to godde
It seems now conuenyente time to come to the fourth point touching the
honor due unto God.


The child. We have said already, that it consysteth in acknowledgyng with
the heart, and in confessyng with the mouth, that God is the author of all
goodness that thereby we may maintain his glory.


The minister. Has God set forth no rule to teach us how we should do this?


The child. All the exemples in the scripture, of lauding, praysyng and
tha^kesgeuynge, ought to be as rules and instructions unto us.


The minister. Is there nothing contained in the Lords prayer touching this
matter?


The child. Yes verelye: for in that we pray that his name may be glorified,
we desire also that all his works may be seen (according as they be in deed)
excellent and praise worthy: i^ such sort, that if he punisshe us, we may
thereby praise the vprightnes of his judgment: if he pardon our fautes, we
may thereby have occasion to magnifye his mercy: when he performs his
promise, we may acknoweledge him to be the infallyble truth: bryefelye we
require that there be nothing at all done wherein the bryghtnes of his glory
be not showed forth unto us: and this is to give unto him the laud and praise
of al goodness.


The minister. What conclusion may we gather of all that we have hitherto spoken?


The child. Verelye we may well conclude of this, the saying of Christ (which
is the truth it self:) that this is life everlasting, to know the very
living God, and him whom he has sent, Ihon. 17.
our savior Christ: to know him (I say) to the end to render due honor unto
him, what everlasting life is. Mat. 1.
that thereby he may become unto us, not only a Lord and master, but also a
father and savior: whereby also we on the other part may be his servants,
his children, and a people wholly consecrated to his glory.


The minister.


The child He has for the same purpose left with us his holy word,
Everlasting life is offered ad presented unto us by gods word.
which is unto us (as it were) an entree into the kingdom of heaven.


The minister Where shall we seek for this his word?


The child It is contained in the holy scripture.


The minister. How must we use this word, to have this profit by it?


The child We must receive it, being perfitly persuaded thereof in our
conscience, as of an undoubted truth sent down from heaven, submittyng our
selves unto it with due obedience, loving it heartily with a fervent and
unfeigned affection, having it so imprinted in our hearts, that we may follow it
and conform our lives wholly unto it.


The minister. Do all these things lie in our power?


The child. No verily, not one of them all: but God woorketh them in our
hearts, in this wise by his holy spirit.


The minister. Is it not required of our part, that we take pain, and do our
diligence both to hear and to read this doctrine which is set forth unto us?


The child. Yes forsooth: and first it is requisite, we must give diligente
labor to learn gods word.
that euerve man privately in his own house give himself to the study of this
word: but principally every man is bound to haunt duly al such sermons as be
made in the congregation of Christ, for the better understanding of this his
doctrine.


The minister Think thou then that it is not enough that every manne do
give diligence to read gods word in his own house, unless they come also
together to hear it preached openly?


The child. I think so: at the least way if God of his goodness do provide
such means that we may hear it.


The minister. What is the reason?


The child. Ephe. 4.
Because our savior has set and established this order in his church, not to
the end that.ii. or three only should observe it, but as a general order
for all men: and he has like wise declared that this is the only way to build
his church and to preserve the same: let us therefore every one be content to
have recourse to this rule, and not become wyser then our master.


The minister. Pastors or ministers in the church are necessary.
Is it then a thing necessary to have pastoures and ministers in the
congregation?


The child. Yea very necessary: and at their mouths men are bound to receive
the word of the Lord with all humble obedience: so that whosoever does set
light of the^, Matt. 10. Luke 10.
and regard not to hear their sayings, they contemn also Jesus Christ, and
deuyde themselves from the fellowship of his flock.


The minister. Is it sufficient that we have been once instructed by their
means: either else must we hear their doctrine continually?


The child It is nothing if a man begin well, unless he continue still in the
same: for we must keep us in Christ's schole, and continue still his scholars
unto the end: and for that cause he has ordained Ministers in the church to
teach us continually in his name


The minister.


The child. God has ordained and coupled the sacraments with the preaching
of his word.


The minister. What thing is a sacrament?


The child. A sacrament is an outward token of gods favor, Of sacraments
which by a visible sign does represent unto us spiritual things, to the e^d
that gods promises might take the more deep root in our hearts: and that we
might so much the more surely give credit unto them?


The minister. What? is this possible that a visible and a material sign
should have such virtue to certifye our conscience?


The child. No, not of it self, but God has ordained it forsuch an end.


The minister. Since it is the proper office of Gods holy spirit, to seal
and imprinte the promises of God in our hearts, how can thou attribute or give
this property unto the sacraments?


The child. There is a great difference between the one and the other: for
gods spirit is he alone, who in very deed is hable to touch and move our
hearts, to illuminate our minds, and to assure our consciences, in such
sort that all these ought to be accounted and reputed his only works, so that
the whole praise and glory hereof ought to be given unto him only: yet this
notwithstanding, it has pleased our Lord to use his sacraments as certain
mean aids or instruments thereof, according as it seemed good unto him,
without diminisshinge (in the mean time) any point of the virtue and woorking
of his spirit.


The minister Thou meaneste then that the efficacy or virtue of the sacraments
does not consyst in the outward elemente or visible sign, but so far forth
as it pleases God to move the conscience therwithall by the working of his
spirit.


The child I mean even so: according as it is gods pleasure to work by
means by him ordained without any derogacion thereby to his glorious power.


The minister. What moved God to institute such instruments or means?


The child. He ordained them to help and counforte our weak nature: The
sacraments were ordained to help our infirmity.
for if we were wholye of a spiritual nature, as the angels are: then we were
apt to consider both God and his manifold graces or benefits, after a
spiritual manner also: but for so much as we are clogged, with earthely bodies,
it was needful for us that God did institute sensible signs, to represente
unto us spiritual and heavenly things: for otherwise we could not so well
comprehend them. Moreover it is necessary for us that al our senses be
exercised in his holy promises, that we might be the better stablyshed in the
same.


The minister. Since God has ordained his sacraments for our necessity: it
were a point of arrogancye and presumpcion to think that they might be as
well left of, as used.


The child. Ye say truth: so that whosoever does willingly forbear the use
of them, estemyng them as things more then needs, The sacraments are
necessary.
and of no importance, he dishonoreth Jesus Christ, he refuses his gracious
benefits, and does willingly quench his holy spirit.


The child But what sure certitude of gods grace be the sacraments hable to
give: seeing both the godly and wicked do receive them?


The minister. Albeit the infideles and wicked do make the grace (which is
offered and presented unto them by the sacraments) void, and to stand them in
none effect: yet it follows not that their office and property is such for all
that.


The child How is it then, and when is it, that the sacraments do produce or
bring forth their operacion and effect?


The child. When a man receives them in faith, when the sacraments take
their effect.
leaning only unto our savior Christ and his merits, seking nothing else but
him in the^.


The minister. What meanest thou by saying that we may seek nothing else but
Christ in them?


The child. I signify thereby, that we may not occupye our minds in
considering the outward or earthly signs, How Christ ought to be soght in
his sacraments.
as though we would seek our health and salvation in the^: neither may we
ymagine that there is any peculiare virtue enclosed or hid in the^: but
contrariwise we do take the sign for an aid or help to lead and to direct
our minds straight into heaven, to the intent that we may there seek our
savior Christ, and al health and goodness in him alone.


The minister. If faith then be required in the ministracion of them, how may
it be that they are ordained and given unto us to strengthen and stablishe us
in the faith, and to assure us of gods promises?


The child It is not enough that faith be once begone in us for a time, The
sacraments be means to nouryshe our faith.
but we must still nourishe it, and mayntaine it, so that it may grow daily,
and be increased in us. For the nourishement, strength and increase therefore
of our faith, God has given us the sacraments containing his merciful
promises, the which thing Saint Paul declares, Romans 4.
sayng that the use of the^ is to seal or-print the promises of God in our
hearts.


The minister But tell me: is not this a token of infidelity, when the
promyses of God be not sufficient of themselves, to give us certain assurance,
unless there be some visible sign as an aid joined unto them?


The child. Verily as ye say, it is a token of a little slender and weak
faith, and yet of that sort the faith of the most part of all the children of
God is: Gods children are not fully perfect in this life.
and notwithstanding they cease not therefore to be called faithful, albeit
they have not as yet attained unto the perfection thereof. For so long as we
live in this world, there abides continually certain remnauntes of unbelief
in our flesh: and therefore we must endeavor by all means continually to
profit and increase in faith:


The minister.


The child. How many sacraments there be.
There be but.ii. which be commune unto all men, and which Christ himself
ordained for his whole faithful flock.


The minister. What be they?


The child. The sacrament of Baptism, and the holy Supper.


The minister. In what points do they agree, and wherein dyffer they, the one
from the other?


The child. Baptysme is as it were an entree into the fellowship or
congregation of God: Of baptism.
for it witnesses certainly unto us that whereas we were before strangers from
God, he does now receive us into his family and houshoulde. The Supper of the
Lord is a sure witness or testymonye unto us, that God will nouryshe, and
refreshe us with food: even as a good master of a house, studieth with
paynefull dilygence to sustain and feed such as be of his houshoulde.


The minister. To the end that we may understand them both so much the
better, The signification of baptism.
let us consider them a part one after another: first what is the right
sygnificacyon of Baptism?


The child. The significacion thereof stands in.ii. points: first our lord
represents unto us herin, the remissyon of our sins: secondarely, Ephe. 5
Romans 6.
our regeneration or new birth in spirit.


The minister.


The child. First the remission of sins is a manner of washing, The mystery
of the water in Baptism.
whereby our souls are cleansed from their fylthynes: even as the uncleanly
fylthe of our body, is washed a way with water.


The minister, What say thou concerning the other point of regeneration?


The child. Because the beginning of our regeneration stands in the
mortyfycation of our nature, that is to say, in the killyng of our affections:
and the full accomplishynge of the same consists in that, that we become new
creatures as touching our co^uersacio^ through the spirit of God therefore the
water is powered upon the head, to sygnifye that we are dead or buried: Wherefore
the water is powered on the head.
and that in such sort, that our risyng again into a new life, is
therwithall fygured, in that, that the pouring of the water is but a thing of a
very short continuance and not ordained that we should be drouned herby.


The minister. Thou meanest not that the water is the thing where with our
souls be washed? The water does not cleanse us, but the blood of Christ only.
1. Ihon. 1.2. Peter. 1.



The child. No: for that belongs to the blood of our savior Christ
alone, which was shed to the e^de that al our fylthe and uncleanness might be
clean wipt away: and that we might be counted pure and without spotte even
before God: the which thing then takes effect in us, what time our
consciences be sprinkled therewith by Gods holy spirit: but the sacrament
does testifye and declare it unto us.


The minister. Why then, meanest thou that the water stands in no othet stead
unto us but as a figure?


The child. It is such a figure as has the verity and substance of that
thing which it signifies, The water is not a bare sign: The promise is joined
to it.
joined unto it: for God is a true keeper of his promise and deceaueth no man,
wherefore it is certain that remission of sins, and newnes of life is offered
unto us in baptysme, and that we receive the same there.


The minister. Is this grace received indifferently of all men?


The child No, for diverse through their perverse mind and unbelief, do
refuse this free offer, whereby it stands the^ in no stead: nevertheless the
sacrament loses not his propertye, for it offers this gift unto them also:
albeit that none feel the comfort thereof, but only the faithful.


The minister. What thing is that whereby our regeneracion is wrought in us?


The child. whereby we are renewed in spirit.
By the death and resurrection of our savior Christ: for his death stands
in this stead unto us, that by it our old Adam is crucified, and our
synnefull nature is (as it were) buried, so that the affections and desires
thereof bear no more rule in us. As touching the other part (which is the
newnes of life) to use a new conversation in obeying Gods will and following
his ryghteousnes, that we obtain by his resurrection.


The minister. How is it that we obtain this grace in baptysme?


The child It is given unto us in that that Christ does there garnish and
deck our souls with the garmente of his holy spirit if so be that we make
not our selves unworthy of his promyses which be there given unto us.


The minister. As touching our part, what is the right using or receauyng of
baptysme?


The child. The right use thereof stands in these two: faith and repentance,
that is, wherein the right using of baptism stands.
in that we be sure that we have our consciences cleansed in the blood of
Christ. And in that we both feel in our selves, and make it known to others
by our works, that his spirit abides in us, to mortyfye our affections
and desires, and so to make us ready to do the will of God.


The minister.


The child. I did not mean that faith and repentance ought always to go
before the ministracion of this sacrament, The baptism of infantes.
for that is only requisite in them that be of age, and discretion: so that it
is sufficienre if the little children show forth the fruits of baptysme when
they are come to sufficient age to know it.


The minister. How wylt thou prove, that there is no inconvenience in this
doing?


The child. For in like manner circumcisyon was a sacrament of repentance,
Deu. 10. and. 30. Iere. 4. Romans 4.
as Moses and the Prophets do wyttnes: and also a sacrament of faith, (as
saint Paul teaches) and yet God did not debar and exclude little children
from the receyuyng of the same.


The minister No, but art, thou able to prove sufficiently, that there is as
good reason they should be received to baptism, as that the other should be
circumcised?


The child. The promises which were made to the Jews only, are now offered
to al men.
Yea, for the reason is largely as sufficienente: for the same promyses which
God did make in time past to his chosen people of Israel, are now extended
with much more euydente declaration into all coasts of the world.


The minister. And follows it therefore, that we must use also the sign?


The child. Yea, if we will consider the thing effectually: For Christ has
not made us partakers of that grace, which belonged in time paste to the
children of Israel, to the intent he would in us dimynishe dimynishe it and
deal it more sparyngly, or that he would make it now more doubteful or less
known than it was before: but rather to the end, he would show forth his
goodness, not only more euidentely, but also more plenteouslye.


The minister. Do thou coumpt then, that if we did deny baptysme to little
children, the grace and goodness of God should be dymynished and darkened by the
coming of Christ?


The child. Yea surely: for we should be by that means destytute of the
express sign of Gods bountyfull mercy toward our children, the which
thing, they that were under the law had: and in very deed this thing serves
highly to our comfort, as to the stably shynge of the promise which has been
made unto us from the beginning.


The minister. Thy mind is then, that forsomuche as it pleased GOD in old
time to declare himself to be the sauyoure, yea of little children, and that he
thought it also good to seal his favorable promise in their bodies by an
outward sacrament and mark: that therefore it is very good reason, that there
be no less tokens of assurance after Christ's coming, since the self same
promise co^tinuynge still is reiterate, and more openly uttered, as well by
word as deed.


The child. Yea: and moreover it seems a thing worthy of notable
reprehencyon, if men would do so much wrong unto children, as to deny
them the sign, which is a thing of less price, since the virtue and
substance of baptysme belongs unto them, which is of much higher estimacion.


The minister. For what consideration, ought we to baptize little children?


The child. To what purpose children are baptized.
They are christened in token and wytnes that they are enherytours of the
blessing of God, which is promised to the lynage of the faithful: to this
end, that when they come to age, they should be instructed what the
substance and meaning of baptism is, to profit them selves thereby.


The minister.


The child. Our lord did ordain it to put us in assurance, Of the lords
Supper.
that by the distribucio^ of his body and blood, our souls are nouryshed in
the hope of life everlasting.


The minister. Why is it that our Lord represents unto us his body by the
bread, and his blood by the wine?


The child. To sygnyfye unto us, that even what property the bread has
toward our bodies, to wete, Christ offers to us his body by the bread. and
his blood by the wine.
to feed and sustain them in this transytorye life: the self same propertye
also his body has touchi^g our souls, that is, to nourishe and refresh them
spirytually. And in like manner as the wine does strengthen, comfort, and
quicken the body of man: even so his blood, is our full joy, our comforth, and
spiritual, strength.


The minister. Doeste thou mean that we must be in deed partakers of the body
and blood of the Lord?


The child. Yea verily, I mean so: The only stay of our trust.
for since the whole trust and assurance of our health and salvation does
consist in the obedience which he has performed unto god his father: (in that
that God does accept it, and take it as if it were ours in deed) we must
first needs possess him, seeing, that his benefits do not belong unto us,
until he have first given himself unto us.


The minister. Why? did not Christ give himself unto us what time he gave
himself to be crucified, to the intent that thereby we might be brought into
the favor of God his father, and be delivered from damnacion?


The child. Yes, but that does not suffyce, unless we do receive him withal,
in such sort as we may feel in our consciences the fruicte and efficacye of
his death and passion.


The minister. After what sort we receive Christ.
Is not faith the ready means to receive Christ by?


The child. Yes forsooth: not only by that that we believe that he dyed and
rose again to deliver us from everlasting death, and to procure us also
everlasting life: but also by that that we feel by faith, that he dwells in
us, and is joined with his members, to the end to make us partakets of al his
graces and benefits because we are unto him united and made all one.


The minister.


The child. Yes verelye: for we receive Christ with the fruicion of his
benefits, 1. Cor. 1.
at the preaching of the gospel, (as. S. Paul witnesses) in that that our
lord Jesus does promise and certifye us therein, that we are bone of his bones,
and flesh of his flesh: Ephe. 5
and again that he is the bread of life which came down from heaven to
nourish our souls: and in an other place, Ihon. 6.
that we are one with him, Ihon. 17.
even as he himself is one with his father, and such like.


The minister. What is there more to be had in the sacrament? or to what use
does it serve us besides?


The child. This is the difference, that Christ and his benefits be more
evidently, lively, and plenteouslye, set forth unto us: for albeit that our
savior Christ be in very deed exhibited unto us, and is made ours by
baptism also, and by the preaching of his word, that is but in a part as it
were, and not fully.


The minister. What is it than briefelye, that we have by this sign of bread?


The child what does the sign of bread teach us.
That the body of our Lord Jesus, for so much as it was once offered up for us
in sacrifice, to bring us in to gods favor, is now given unto us, to assure us
that we are partakers of this joyful reconciliacion.


The minister. And what have we by the sign of wine?


The child. what is signified to us by the wine
It assures us, that as our lord Jesus did shed his blood once on the cross
for a full price and recompense of al our sins: even so he now gives it unto
our soul to drink, whereby we should not doubt to receive the fruit and
benefit thereof.


The minister. By these thy aunsweres, I gather that the lords supper does
direct, and as it were conduite us, to the death and passion of our savior
Christ: to the intent we may be partakers of the virtue and profit thereof.


The child. It does even so: for even then when he suffered, the only and
everlasting sacrifice was offered up for our redempcio^. Wherefore there
remains now nothing else, but that we should have the fruits thereof.


The minister. The supper then was it not ordained to offer up the body and
blood of our savior to God his father? The lords supper is not a sacrifice.
propiciatorie.



The child. No: Christ alone is the everlasting bishop. Hebru. 5. Mat. 26.
for there is none but he alone unto who^ that office belongs for so much as
he is the everlasting sacrificer: but the charge that he has given unto us
is, that we do receive his body, and not offer it.


The minister.


The child. Our Lord did that to help thereby our infyrmite: signifying that
he is as well the drink as the meat of our soul: The ordeining of two signs
was for our wekenes.
to the end we might be content to seek our nourishment fully and wholly in him,
and no where else.


The minister. Does the second sign (which is) the cup, belong indifferentely
unto al men?


The child. Yea, and that by the commandment of our savior Christ, contrary
whereunto we may in no wise do.


The minister. Receive we in the supper only the tokens of the things before
rehearsed? either are they effectually in deed there given unto us?


The child. Forsomuche as our Savior Christ it the truth it self, it is
nothing to be doubted, that the promises which he made at his supper, be not
there in deed accomplished, and that which is figured by the signs is truly
performed: so then according as he there made promise, and as the signs do
represent, theris no doubt, but he makes us partakers of his very substance,
to make us also one with him, and in one life with him.


The minister. How we receive Christ in the supper.
But tell me how this may be done, seeing the body of our savior Christ is in
heaven, and we are here as pilgrims on the earth.


The child. Verily it cummeth to pass by the woonderous and unsearchable
woorkynge of his spirit who joins easelye together things being far a
sundre in place.


The minister. Thy mind is then, that his body is not presently included in the
bread, neither his blood contained within the cup.


The child. No not a whit: but clean contrary wise, what is to be done if we
will ceceaue the subtance of the sacraments.
if we will have the substance of the sacrament, and the every thing which is
signified thereby: we must at the receiving thereof lift up our hearts into
heaven, where our savior Christ is in the glory of his father, from whence
we have sure hope that he will come for our redemption: and therefore we may
not search him in these corruptible elements, as if he were presently there.


The minister. So then thy judgment is, that there be two things in this
Sacrament: the substance of bread and wine, which we see with the eye,
touch with our hand and feel, or sauoure with our taste: and also our
savior Christ by whom our souls are inwardlye nouryshed


The child. You say truth: Pleadges of our resurrection
and in such sort that we have therewith also a sure token, and (as it were) an
earnest penye of the rysyng again of our bodies, in so much as they are already
made partakers of the sign of life.


The minister.


The child. 1. Cor. 11.
Saint Paul teaches the right manner of the vsyng thereof; (which is,) that
every man examine himself before that he come unto it.


The minister. Wherein ought a man to try and examyne himself?


The child. He must considre whether he be a true membre of Christ our
Savior.


The minister. Whereby may a man have sure knowledge thereof?


The child. If he have a faith or right considence in Gods promises, The
sure tokens of a true Coristian.
being inwardlye sorye for his sins, and do love his neighbor with an
unfeigned charity, not keeping in his heart any rancoure, hatred, or debate.


The minister. But is it requisite to have a perfect faith, and perfect
charity?


The child. We must needs have both the one and the other, sound, right, and
not counterfaited: but to speak of such a perfection, as unto which nothing
can be added, a man shall not be able to find it in the whole multitude of men:
so then this supper had been a thing ordained in vain, if none were mete to
come to it, unless he were thoroughly perfect.


The minister. By this saying, our imperfection does no whit hinder us from
cumming thereunto?


The child. No verily: but rather contrariwyse, it should stand us in no
stead, if we were not imperfect, for it is as an help and succor, against
our infyrmitye.


The minister. Do these two sacraments serve to no other end, but to
supporte and bear up our imperfection?


The child. Yes, they are also very signs and badges of our profession? that
is to say, by them we protest openly that we are the people of God, and make
open profession of our christen relygyon.


The minister. What shall we then judge of him that refuses to use them?


The child. We ought not to count him a christen mane: for in so doing he
refuses to confess or knowledge himself to be a christian, and what is that
else, but as it were covertly to refuse Christ?


The minister. Is it enough to receive them both, once only in our life
time?


The child. Baptism was ordained to be received but once, wherefore it is not
lawful to be christened again: but it is other wise to be thought of the
supper.


The minister. What is the reason thereof?


The child. How it is that we receive the supper oftimes though we may be but
once baptized.
This: by baptysme God doethe bring, and receive us into his church: and when
he has once received us, he declares also to us by the supper, that he will
feed us continually.


The minister.


The child. Unto them who have taken charge to preach openly in the church:
To whom the ministracion of the sacraments do belong
for the preaching of Gods word and the ministracion of the sacraments be
things ioynctely belongyng to one kind of office.


The minister. Is there not a substancyal proof to be brought for this?


The child. Yes verily: Mat. 28
for our Lord gives special charge to his Apostles, as well to baptyse as to
preach: and as touching the supper, he gives them iniunction to follow his
exaumple: now he did the part of a minyster, in that he gave and distributed
it to others.


The child. The pastors, who be the mynysters of the sacraments, ought they
to receive indifferently every person that comes?


The child. As touching baptism, who ought to he shut out from the supper.
forsomuche as there be none in our time baptized but little children, there
ought to be no choice used: but as concerning the supper, the minister must
have so much dyscrecyon as to refuse to give it to them that be utterly
unworthy.


The minister. Wherefore?


The child. Because that otherwise the supper of the Lord should be defiled
and dishonored


The minister. But yet our Lord admytted Judas to the holy supper,
notwithstanding his wickedness.


The child. wherefore Judas was admitted to the supper.
Yea, for his wickedness was hitherto hyd. and albeit our Lord knew it right
well, yet was it not notoryous and known unto men.


The minister. What way is to be used then toward the hipocrites?


The child. The minister ought not to exclude a^dshut out them, as unworthy:
but he must tarry until it shall please GOD to make their close wickedness
known.


The minister What if he himself know, or if he be prieuely advertised of any
such?


The child. That is not a sufficient cause for him to deny them the supper,
unless he have the thing tried by suffyciente proof: and there with the
judgment of the congregation.


The minister. Is it then meet to have a polytyke order touching this matter?


The child. What else? if the congregation be well ordered: there must be
certain appointed to watch, and take dyligente heed for such open crimes as
may be committed: and they having auctorytye, ought in the name of the whole
congregation, to inhibite such as be by no means mete, neither can be
partakers thereof without the dyshonoure of God, and the offense of the
faithful.


The end of the instruction of children in the faith.
THE MANNER TO EXAmine children before they be admitted to the Supper of the
lord.
First the Minister asks. IN whom do thou believe?


The child answers. I believe in god the father, and in Jesus Christ his
son, and in the holy ghost: and look to be saved by non other means.


The minister. The father, the son, and the holy ghost, be they any more then
one god?


The child, No, although they be distinct in person.


The minister. What is the effect of thy faith?


The child. That god the father of our lord Jesus Christ, (and so by him of us
all) is the beginnynge and principal cause of all things: the which he
governs in such sort, that nothing can be done with owte his ordinance, and
providence. Next, that Jesus Christ his son, came down into this world, and
accomplished all things which were necessary for our salvation. And ascended
into heaven, where he sits at the right hand of the father, that is, that he
has all power in heaven and in earth. And shall come again from thence to
judge the whole world. Forthermore that the holy ghost is very god, becawse he
is the virtue and power of god, and impri^teth i^ our hearts the promesses made
unto us in Jesus Christ. And finally that the church is sanctified, and
delivered from their sins through the mercies of god, and shall after this
life rise again to life everlasting.


The minister. Must we serve God according as he has commanded, or else as
men's traditions teach us?


The child. We most serve him as he has taught us by his word and
commandments, and not according to the commandments of men.


The minister. Can thou keep gods commandments of thy self?


The child No verily.


The minister Who then does keep and fulfill them in thee?


The child The holy ghost.


The minister. When God then geuethe thee his holy ghost can thou parfytely
observe them?


The child No, not so.


The minister. Why? God does curse and reject all such as do not in every point
fulfill his commandments.


The child. It is true.


The minister. By what means then, shall thou be saved, and delivered from
the curse of God?


The child. By the death and passion of our lord Jesus Christ.


The minister How so?


The child. For becawse that by his death, he has restored us to life, and
reconciled us to God his father.


The minister To whom do thou make thy prayers?


The child I pray to God in the name of our lord Jesus Christ our aduocat and
mediator, referring all my prayers to that scope, which Christ our savior has
left us as a most sufficient and absolute rule.


The minister. How many Sacraments are there in Christ's Church?


The child. Two, Baptism, and the lords Supper.


The minister. What is meant by Baptism?


The child. First it signifies that we have forgiveness of our sins by the
blood of Christ. Secondly it sets before our eyes our regeneration or new
spiritual birth.


The minister. What signifies the Supper of the lord?


The child. That by the spiritual eatinge and drinkinge, of the body and
blood, of our lord Jesus Christ, our sowles are norished unto life
everlasting.


The minister. What do the bread and wine represent, in the lords Supper?


The child. This, that as our bodies are norished therewith: so our sowles are
sustained, and norished with the virtue of Christ's body and blood, not that
they are enclosed in the bread and wine, but we must seek Christ in heaven
in the glory of God his father.


The minister. By what means may we attain unto him there?


The child. By faith, which gods spirit works in our hearts, assuringe us
of Gods promises made to us in his holy gospel.

deserve thy wrath and sharp punishment, but rather receive us to thy mercy
for Jesus Christ's sake, acceptinge his death and passion as a just 1. Ioh. 2.

recompense, for all our offenses, in whom only, thou art pleased and through
whom thou can not be offended with us. And saying that of thy great mercies,
we have quietly passed this night, grant (o heavenly father) that we may spend

thoghtes, words, and deeds, may redounde to the glory of thy name, and good
ensample to all men: who saying our good works, may glorify thee our heavenly
father. And forasmoche as of thy mere beneuole^ce, and love, thou haste not
only created us to thyme own Genesis 1. d.
similitude, and lykenes, but also haste chosen us to be heirs with thy dear
son Jesus Christ, of that immortal kingdom which thou preparedst for us
before the beginnynge of world: we beseech thee to Luke 17. a.
increase our faith and knowlage, and to lighten our hearts with thy holy
spirit, that we may in the mean time live in golyd conversation and
integrity of life: knowinge that Gal. 5. d.
idolaters, adulterers, covetous men, contentious persons, dronkardes, glotons,
and such like shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

(.) And becawse thou haste commanded us to pray one for on other, we do not
only make request (o lord) for our selves and them that thou have already
called to the true understanding of thy heavenly will, but for all people and
Act: 10. e 1. Tim. 2. a

their life and doctrine, only seek thy glory. Contrarely confownd Romans 16. c
Satan, Antechrist, with all hyrelinges and papists, whom thou have already
cast of into a reprobate sense, that they may not by sects, schisms,

fallen into the latter days, and 2. Tim. 3. a

his ministers seek by all means to quench the light of thy gospel, we
beseech thee to maintain thy cawse against those Matt. 7. c

and bondage. Let not thy long sufferinge be an occasion either to increase
their tyranny or to discorage thy childrene, nether yet let our sins and

these great miseries: and chieflye, the afflictions of our Contrie, which once
flourished through thy mercies, and now for contempt of thy word is Amos 8.

shall we thus be left in despair? shall all the world laugh at our shame for

vengeance to come, both by thy word and exemples of others. For thy people

sins provoked thine anger, and thou ponishedest them, by thy just
judgment, yet though their sins were never so grievous, if they once returned
from their iniquity, thou receyuedst them to Esa. 37. a
mercy. we therefore most wretched sinners bewail our manyfolde sins, and
earnestly repent us for our former wickedness and ungodly behauyor toward
thee, and whereas we can not of our Romans 7. d 2. Cor. 3. Luke 17. c
selves purchase thy pardon: yet we humbly beseech thee, for Jesus Christ sake,
to show thy mercies upon us, and restore us again to thy favor. Grant us
dear father these our requests, and all other things necessary for us and
thy whole church, according to thy promise in Jesus Christ our lord: In
whose name we beseech the as he has taught us saing. Our father. etc.

A prayer to be said before meals.
ALL things depend upon thy providence (o lord) to receive at thy hands, due
sustenance in time convenient. Psalm. 104.
Thou geuest to them, and they gather it, thou openest thy hand, and they are
satisfyede with all good things.

O heavenly father which art the fountain and full treasure of all goodness,
we beseech thee to show thy mercies upon us thy children, and 1. Tim. 4. b.
sanctify these gifts which we receive of thy merciful liberality,
grauntinge us grace to use them, Tit. 2. c
soberlie and purely according to thy blessed will: so that hereby we may
ackonwledge the to be the author and gyuer of all good things, and above all,
that we may remember continually, to seek the Ioh. 6. c. d
spiritual food of thy word, wherewith our souls may be norished
everlastingly, through our savior Christ, who is the true Ihon. 6. c
bread of life, which came down from heaven, of whom, who so ever eats
shall live for ever, and reign with him in glory world without end. So be
yt.

A Thanks geuinge after meals.
LEt all nations magnify the lord, Psalm. 117.
let all people rejoice, in praysinge and extollinge his great mercies. For his
fatherly kindness is plentifully shewede forth upon us, and the truth of his
promise, endures for ever.

WE render Col. 3. c.
thanks unto thee (o lord God) for the manifold benefits which we contynually
receive at thy bountefull hand, not only for that it has pleased thee to
feed us in this present life, geuinge unto us all things necessary for the
same: but especially because thou haste of thy free mercies Romans 8. c. Tit. 3.
b.
fashioned us a new, into an assured hope of a far better life, the which
thowe have 2. Tim. 1. b.
declared unto us by thy holy gospel. Therefore we humbly beseech the (o
heavenly father) that thou wylt not suffer our affections to be so 1. Ioh. 2. ^
entangled or rooted in these earthly and corruptible things: but that we may
always have our minds directed to thee on 1. Tim. 2. b.
high, continually watchinge for the 1. Cor. 1. b
coming of our lord and sauyor Christ Romans 8. d
what time he shall appear for our full, redemption. to whom with thee, and
the holy ghost, be all honor, and glory, for ever and ever. So be it.

Evening prayers.
O LORD God father everlasting and full of pity, we acknowledge and confess,
that we be not Luke 15. d. 18. c
worthy to lift up our eyes to heaven, much less to present our selves
before thy Majesty with confidence that thou wilt hear our prayers and grawnt
our requests, if we consider our own deseruinges: for our consciences do
accuse us, and our sins witness against us and we know that thou art a^
upright judge, which do not justify the sinners and wicked me^, but Exodus
2. a.
ponishes the fautes of all such as transgress thy commandments. Yet most
merciful father, since it has pleased thee to Psalm. 50. c.
command us to call on thee in all our troubles and adversities, promesinge
even then to help us, when we feel our selves as it were, swalloued up of
death and Psalm. 18. a
desperation, we utterly renounce all worldely confidence, and flee to thy
sovereign bounty, as our only stay and refuge: besechinge thee not to call
to Psalm. 79. b.
remembrance our manifold sins, and wickedness, whereby we contynually provoke
thy wrath and indignation against us: neither our negligence and unkindness,
which have neither worthily esteemed, nor in our lives sufficiently expressed,
the sweet comfort of thy gospel reveled unto us: but rather to accept the
obedience and death of thy son Jesus Christ, who by offeringe up his body in
Hebr. 9 10
sacrifice once for all, has made a sufficient recompense for all our sins.
Have mercy therefore upon us o lord, and forgive us our Psalm. 19. d
offenses. Teach us by thy holy spirit, that we may rightlye way them, and
earnestly repent for the same. And so much the rather o lord, becawse that the
Psalm. 58. a
reprobate, and such as thou have forsaken, can not praise thee, nor call upon
thy name, but the Psalm. 5. e
repe^tinge heart, the sorrowful mind, the conscience oppressed, Psalm. 107. a
hungringe, and thirstinge for thy grace, shall ever set forth thy praise and
glory. And albeit we be but Psalm. 22. a.
worms and dust: yet thou art our creator, and we be the work of thy hands,
yea thou art our 2. Cor. 6. b.
father, and we thy children: thou art our shepherde and we thy flock: thou
art our redemer and we the people whom thou haste boght: thou art our God and
we thyn enheritance. Ier. 10. b. Psalm. 6. a.
Correct us not therefore in thine anger (o lord) neither according to our
deserts poneshe us, but mercifully chastise us with a fatherly affection, that
all the world may know, that at what Eze. 18. d
time so ever a sinner does repent him of his sin from the bottom of his
heart, thou wylt put away his wickedness out of thy remembrance, as thou haste
promesed by thy holy Prophet. This mark directs us to that part of the
morninge prayer that is for thincrease of the gospel, which also may be said
here as time erueth.
Finally forasmoche as it has pleased thee to make the night for man to rest
in, as thou haste ordained him the day to travel, grant o dear father, that
we may so take our bodily rest, that our souls may contynually Luke 12. e.
watch for the time that our lord Jesus Christ shall appear for our
deliverance owte of this mortal life, and in the mean season that we, not
overcome by any Mat. 6. b.
tentations, fantasies, dreams, or illusions, may fully set our minds upon
thee, love thee, fear thee, and rest in thee: furthermore, that our sleep be
not Luke 21. e.
excessive or ouermoche after the insaciable desires of our flesh: but only
sufficient to content our weak nature, that we may be better disposed to live
in all godly conversation, to the glory of thy holy name, and profett of our
brethern. So be it.

A PRAYER MADE at the first assemble of the congregation, When the confession
of our faith, and Whole orders of the church Was there red, and approved.
O lord God almighty, and father most merciful, there is 3. king. 8. c.
none like thee in heaven nor in earth: which workest all things for the
glory of thy name, and the comfort of thine elect. Thou dydst once make man
ruler ouerall thy creatures, and Genesis 1. d. 2. b.
placed him in the garden of all pleasures: but how sone (alas) did he in his
felicity Genesis 3. d.
forget thy goodness? Thy people Israel also in their wealth did evermore run
Exodus 23. b.
astray, abusinge thy manifold mercies: like as all flesh contynually rages,
when it has gotten liberty, and external prosperity. But such is thy
wisdom adjoined to thy mercies (dear father) that thou Ezech. 18. g.
sekest all means possible, to bring thy children to the sure sens, and
lively feelinge, of thy fatherly favor. And therefore when prosperity will not
serve, then sendest thou adversity, graciously Hebr. 12. a. Proverb. 7. a..
correctinge all thy children whom thou receyuest into thy howshold. Wherefore
we wretched and miserable sinners render unto thee most humble and hearty
thanks, that yt has pleased thee to call us home to thy fold by thy fatherly
correction at this present, whereas in our prosperity and liberty we did
neglect thy graces offered unto us. For the which negligence and many other
grievous sins, whereof we now accuse our selves before thee, thou might
most justly have given us up to Romans 1. d
reprobate mynds, and induration of our hearts, as thou haste done others. But
such is thy goodness (o lord) that thou semest Esa. 47. d.
to forget all our offenses, and haste called us of thy good pleasure from all
Idolatries, into this City most christianlye reformed, to profess thy name,
and to suffer some Matthew. 5. a.
cross emongeste thy people for thy truth and gospells sake: and so to be thy
Luk 24. g. Act 1. a.
witnesses with thy prophets and Apostles, yea with thy dearly beloved son
Jesus Christ our head, to whom thou do begin here to fashon us like, that
in his 1. Ioh. 3. a.
glory we may also be like him when he shall appear. O lord God what Psalm. 8.
a.
are we upon whom thowe should show this great mercy. O most loving
lord, forgive us our unthankfulness, and all our sins for Jesus Christ's sake.
O heavenly father increase thy holy spirit in us, to teach our hearts to
cry Gal. 4. a.
Abba dear father, to assure us of our eternal election in Christ, to reuele
thy will more and more toward us, to confirm us so in thy trewthe, that we
may live and dye therein: and that by the power of the same spirit, we may
boldly give an accounts of our faith to all men with humblenes and mekenes,
that 1. Peter 3. c.
where as they backbyte and slander us as evil doers, they may be ashamed and
once stopp their mowthes, saying our good conversation in Christ Jesus, for
whose sake we beseech the (o lord God) to guide, govern, and prosper this our
enterprise in assemblinge our brethren to praise thy holy name. And not only
to be here present with us thy children Math. 18. d.
according to thy promise: but also mercifully to assist thy like persecuted
people, our brethren, gathered in all other places, that they and we,
consentinge together in one Romans 15. b.
spirit and truethe may (all worldly respects set a part) seek thy only
honor, and glory, in all our, and their assembles. So be it.

1. Cor. 3. No man can lay any other foundation then that which is laid, even
Jesus Christ.
