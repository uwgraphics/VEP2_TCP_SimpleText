LAntore being taken, see what haste they make
To murder children for their Parents sake,
And Parents for their own; see how they lie,
(Ah could the Insculptor but ingrave their cry)
Pickled in blood, whilst Mr. Woof's distress
Sadly instructs him to expect no less.
Observe his fellow Captive, see their arms
Are linck'd together; but Alas their harms
Were much unlike; the one received a stroke,
Which freed his neck from the tyrannick yooak
Of the enslaving Dutch; behold he lies
A miserable headless Sacrifice:
See how his humbled head salutes the feet
Of Death, expecting Woofe, who fears to meet
A second stroke, which made him start, but he
Being shouldered down, beheld the Tragedy,
But acted not; this done, to make the most
Of what they had, they tied him to a Post
Between two Captives; after this they sent
These three, fast tied (for further punishment)
Aboard their ship, called Holland, where they had
Plenty enough, of grief, to make them mad;
But Heaven thought good, to make this truth appear,
By Woofe; then clowded there, now shining here.

THE EPISTLE To the READER.
Courteous Reader,
THis Relation coming to me from Mr. Woofe (that was both a lo^ser and
Sufferer in the business, which you shall find hereafter expressed) I thought
it altogether unnecessary to let a truth of such concernment lie buried in
Oblivion; my pains has only been to Illustrate and extract out of his Papers
that which is here presented to thy view; The reason perhapps may be demanded,
why it was not published to the World before this time, to which the Author
makes this reply, That his occasions lying constantly beyond the Seas, would
not permit him to Print it sooner, and moreover, he thought to have gained
some consideration for his Losses, but his hopes were frustrated; so the Times
presenting him with an opportunity, he has thought fit to let the World know
how much wrong our Nation has formerly sustained by the Dutch; and to maintain
the truth of this, he is willing to venture his life and fortunes, and has
often been importuned by Persons of great quality to devulge his Losses and
Sufferings; and truly I must needs confess, I had rather hear an old Truth,
then a new Lie; and so I wish the Reader may take as much Pleasure in the
Reading, as he had pain in the suffering,

Reader, Farewell. JOHN QUARLES.

To the most Illustrious and Excellent the Lord General, Oliver Cromwell,
Captain General of all the Militia of England, Ireland and Scotland. And to the
Right Honorable the Council of State, Constituted for the protection and
Conservation of this Commonwealth.
WHen sad truths find cheerful remedies, the sufferers find much
encouragement, and the relievers much applause,

What is here presentted, is not the addle fixion of a froathy brain, but a
perfect relation of an abused Nation: Be therefore pleased to let your serious
eyes peruse this small Volume wherein your Honor shall find truth pilgrimaging
after Justice.

If Justice then be the ordinary refuge for truth, I hope I have a sufficient
plea for my boldness in presenting this truth to be secured by Your Justice.

As I love not adullation, so I know your Honors expects it not; May therefore
the principles of wisdom and Justice dwell upon your Actions, that so the
abused may find redress, and the abusers punished, Which shall be the hearty
and daily Prayers of him that is

A perfect honourer of your Lordships Virtues, Abraham Woofe.

THE TYRANNY OF THE DUTCH Against the ENGLISH, etc.
IN the year of our Lord God, 1618, in the month of February; It was my
Fortune to venture at Sea in a French Pinnace (whose burden was about 30. Tun,
with one Captain Iackson, Commander in chief, and one Edward Twelfes his
second, with whom I was commanded by Captain Iourden chief of Bantam, to leave
Iackatray road (where I was then resident) and ^aile Eastward; first to Mocassa
to transport three or four Bandaneeses to Banda; having hoysted Sail, it
pleased Godto afford us an oportune wind, which in the space of 14. days blessed
us with a happy arrival at Mocassa, where our stay exceeded not the limits of
a week, insomuch that within fourteen days more we were ^ly delivered in the
Islands of Banda, but the period of our Voyage was not till we came to
Pullaroone, which is the Westermost Islands of those parts, at which place (our
Sails being filled with a favorable wind from Heaven) we Anchored in the most
variable Month of March, with as much joy and thankfulness, as safety and
present content: In th^se parts the Reader may please to take notice of one
remarkable thing, the Wind (eminent for nothing more then its uncertainty)
seats it self in the East, and revels there for 5. months, and at the
expiration of that time gives an Acquittance to Zepherus, and from the Orient
posts to the Occident, and there entertains it self 5. months more, proclaiming
(as it were) September and March to be two certain uncertain Months: Here I
inhabited from the year, 1618. till the year 1620. and in part of that year I
was sent from Pulleroon with one Mr. Randolph in chief, and I Abraham Woof (the
Testator and an eyewitness of the ensuing Discourse) was second, and one
Nicholas Gates the third, which were all the Englishmen which were upon the
great Island of Lantore, yet we had in our Fa^ry one old Armenian, and some
other menservants appertaining to us for the steeving of Mace into Sucles, and
carrying it, and other necessary goods, to Warehouses.

Now about Michaelmas time, in the year 1620, we had in chief one Captain
Nathanel Courtupe a Kentish-man, and one Mr. Hayes his second, who was always
conversant with him, and lived in his house upon Pulleroon; this Captain
Courtupe was a man more faithful then fortunate, of whom I shall more sadly
treat hereafter; In the mean time I will make a short digression to inform
the Reader of the manner of the Island of Pullaroone, and the manners of the
Inhabitants.

1. Pullaroone is situated on the south Seas, a Place temperate and wholesome,
insomuch that there was but 1 man known to die in 4 years; It is very firtyl in
bearing of Mace and Nutmegs, and other Provisions for the food of man: It lies
between 5 or 6 degrees from the Sun: The Inhabitants are generally Mahumetans,
and strictly follow the directions of the Turkish Alkeron; they are people very
devout, and strict in their Religion, most severe punishers of Murder and
Adultery, they are men Warrlike, and agile, strong and valiant, always subject
to revenge an injury; their weapon is for the most part, Sword and Buckler, at
which they play with such dexterity, that they can hardly be equalled by any,
but themselves; They are courtuous and affable, bountefull and respective
entertainers to all, full of contention amongst themselves, but generally
united against the common Enemy; These People for a time enjoyed as much
terreen happiness as they could desire, and more then they could deserve, but
at last they were subdued and subjugated by that avaritious, tyrannical and
fallatious Nation the Dutch, whose infidellities and Tragical Actions craves
mo^ imbittered expression, then the world affords Ink to write, or Tongues to
express; These are those whose general intrusions into most opulent parts have
enriched themselves by the utter ruin and extirpation of others, whose desires
to wealth are as voratious as the Sea that transports them to their prey; these
are they that have a long time been exiled these three imperial Courts; fides
impietas, and Charet^, because they ever did retain venales animae, shaking
off fas, and Idolizing Nef^s, but in short, their subduing of Pullaroone was
more to the detriment of the English then can easily be imagined, not only
there, but also in the adjacent Clove Islands; but to show them a little in
their colors, I shall at (...) ^t only resite one of their petty Baroarisins,
and return to the aforementioned Captain Courtupe, who was betrayed to death
by them in manner following:

This Captain Courtupe (accidental business intervening) was enforced to go to
a place called Lantore (which was more then ever he did in my time) which
Lantore is an Island opposite (a small distance) to Pullaroone, being rowed
over by the Bandaneeses themselves; In the interim of his abode on the other
side) we having three or four Dutch runnegadoes with us) one of them, in the
absence of this unfortunate Captain, stole away in the dead time of the Night a
small Prooe, which is a little Boat, and with one Paddle or Oar, rowed over to
Pullaway, which is a Island seated between Pullaroon and Lantore, and related
to the Dutch there resident; that Captain Courtupe was in the Lantore Island,
and that within three or four nights he was expected to make his return to
Pullaroone; which welcome news put them into a serious consideration of
mischief, how they might entrap him in his transportation; They understanding
(by the information of their welcome Traitor) that Captain Courtupe was to come
over speedily from Lantore to Pullaroone in a Noranbagg, gave command that a
Currecure (whose strength far exceeded the strength of Captain Courtups boat,
which was but very small should be fitted out, which was forthwith done; this
villainous Plott, was not long destitute of a most bloody effect, for meeting
(according to their unsanctified wishes) with our Captains boat, immediately
fell upon her, and pouring in shot (as it were by wholsaile) killed our most
worthy and renowned Captain, whose death was as much lamented by us, as it was
rejoiced at by those treacherous and blood-thirsty Dutch, who not only
tryumphed in his death, but in the death of some others that were with him; but
this unexpected news was not long a stranger to our ears, for some that
escaped the fury of these Nero-like blood-suckers, having nothing to conduct
them but the Waves, swom to Pulleroone, and after some seasonable respite,
sadly related (though at first) the unbelieved misfortune of our unfortunate
Captain: Yet notwithstanding this credible information, Mr. Hayes forthwith
sent away a boat with a flagg of truce to Pullaway, not so much to know the
truth of the matter, as the reason of their unhumane actions; Their only reply
was, that he was dead, and that we should take no further care for him, he
should be buried: Thus by those Canniballs, in a Dutch dress, this worthy
Captain lost his life; but this cruelty was not long without a reward, as shall
be declared.

On the 20. of December after the p^rpetration of this horrid and most
abominable act, it happened that on the Lords Day there came within the compass
of our view a Vessel, but what she was we could not presently imagine, and
being in sight of all the Banda Islands, the Sea altered her countenance, and
withdrew her frowns, insomuch that there was such an absolute calm, that all
the Islands made out their Currecurs, which in calm weather are the best
servants; But the Hollander having but one Currecur, and being deficient of
strength to encounter with them in the day, although (like Thieves) in the
night their thoughts and deeds are full of mischief and villainy; this small
Vessel being the Westward of all the Banda Islands, we stood still as well as
the Hollander, because they were all our friends, and the total of our
strength was but one Oranbagg and two or 3 small Prooes or little Boats; but we
knew our Island, being the next neighbor to the Vessel, should be first
saluted with the news, to which purpose that day about three or four of the
clock in the afternoon the great Boats or thievish Bandaneeses men of War came
on shore, toing of this Vessel, yet we could not discover whether it was a
Dutchman, or an Englishman, so that we being covetous of the truth, lanched
from our little Island of Nalacco with one of our Boats manned with nine men, to
discover what news, but coming amongst them I my self being one of them) we
found it to be a small Vessel of the Hollanders, strengthened but with seven
men, and three of the chiefest of them the Bandaneeses had killed, and thrown
away their bodies, but their heads they brought ashore, the sight whereof made
us firmly apprehensive of Gods immediate justice and Judgment showed on them,
that had bin so unjust to others; but for the 4. that were left alive, Captain
Hayes bought them of the Bandaneeses, what Market he made I know not, but if he
gave above pence a-piece, his Market was bad, in respect the last proved so
ill; by these people we came to the knowledge of the agreement and peace
concluded between the Dutch and us, for we found Letters to that effect, the
news of which made our Captain forthwith send away the 4. Dutchmen which he had
bought, to Pullaway; we also proffered them the Vessel which our Captain had
bought of the Bandaneeses, but their modesty was such, that they (to our
admiration) refused to accept of that which our purses paid for, so desired us
to keep it and convert it to our own use, for by their Letters they were fully
informed what strength both we and themselves had coming, which made them
civilly politic, or politickly civil.

Now within a Month after our hearts were very much exhillerated by the
approach of an English Ship, called the Lions Claw, the presence of this Vessel
banished our former Melancholy, and we that before were almost contristed to
death, were now elevated into extremity of joy.

But the old Principle holds true, Nullum violentum est perpetuum, no extreme
is permanent, neither were these extreme new joys to my self and some few
others, which shall be forthwith knowingly and sadly related.

The Ship which I formerly made mention of being arrived with commodities,
caused our Captain to ruminate about the settlement of his Factory in the
Island of Lantore, upon which it was demanded who would, or dared to venture the
undertaking of the Factory in Lantore; and to speak according to truth, indeed
many were unfitting, and many were unwilling to go, because they feared an
alteration, our Captain being in this dilemma, in respect of the unwillingnesse
and disability of most of the Company to go to the Factory, I with two more
freely proffered our selves, and was as willingly and freely accepted, and
loaded with the retribution of many thanks from our new Captain, but our after
experience instructed us to believe that they were the wisest that staid upon
Nalacca Island til the last, for although our thoughts were sown with the
seeds of profit, and expected to have reapt the double benefit in our Estates,
we received more then trebble losses by the perfidious Hollander, besides the
great danger and hourly hazard of our lives, and the extreme punishment we
received in our bodies, and all by the Jewish dealings of the too much
insentiate Hollander; as often as I think of their unparralelled and almost
unimitable severity I cannot but admire, and praise with admiration, that great
God which strengthened and so much enabled me to undergo those heavy pressures
which were loaded upon me by those Patrons of cruelty; God forgive them, and
grant that I may be truly considerate and thankful to him for sparing my life
in such eminent dangers, and for preserving me hitherto ever since that time,
it being from this time 31. years since those barbarous exactions were imposed
upon me by the Turkish-like Hollander, whose baseness I want as much language
to express, as I crave patience to forgive; had our deserts importuned the lest
of their Tyrannies, it would have put some gloss upon the face of so foul
dealings; but I protest (to my knowledge) we never treated them with the least
incivility, but were always willing to live quietly amongst them, but the
turbulancy of their spirits always put a false construction upon our true
meaning, daily laboring to subvert us, and those that were our Adherents, as
shall forthwith be declared.

Not long after our safe Arrival and settlement in Lantore, there arrived a
Junck with a China man, laded with commodities, and houndlike after their scent
came the full mouthed Hollander, and with them a Vessel entitled, A Float,
with great Guns in her purposely for Battery, this Vessel was towed most part
of the way from Iackatray (which they now nickname, and call Battavia) but
these Hollanders lying about Lantore, began to parley with the Lantore man, and
continued there parlying about two Months; but this benefit we had, that which
the Dutch agitated by day we were informed by the Lantore men at night, by
which we understood how importunate the Dutch was to have the Island of Lantore
into their hands and custody, sometimes they would fairly persuade and entreat
the Lantore men to yield to their persuasions, and sometimes threaten them with
Fire and Sword, if they refused to condescend to their Proposalls; and
sometimes telling them, that although they had given the Island to the King of
England, they need not fear to disclaim what they had done, and make them
Masters of it; for they could, nay and would interpose between all danger and
them, and that they had sufficient strength to guard them from all the Nations
in the world, if they would give them a pawn to enjoy the profits of their
Fruits at those terms the English had conditioned with them: The Lantore men
being in this perplexity, and doubting among themselves what might happen to
them by the refusal of what was proff^red, addressed themselves to us, desiring
to be informed how we could secure them from these insatiate people whose
persuasions were as plausible, as their threatening terrible; to whom we replied
that we conceived their fear was built upon bad grounds, in respect that we
were confident relief was not far distant from us, and that our Fleet would
forthwith come to our assistance; therefore we encouraged them, and char^ed
them to be courageous, and not to yield to their unjust persuasions; These
words so much animated them, that the next time the Dutch desired a pawn from
them, they pleaded ignorance, telling them that they knew not the signification
of a Pawn, and made themselves wonderfully inqusitive what that Pawn was which
they made mention of; At this, the Dutch began to be something petulant, but
with an advised consideration told them that they must bring a Brass Basin
filled with Earth, and plant in the middle of it the branch of a Nutmeg Tree
loaded with Fruit, and cause it to be presented to them by the hands of the
chiefest men of their Islands; and this the Hollander told them was the meaning
of the Pawn.

The Lantore Men after a serious, but short pause, returned answer to this
effect; Your Demands are our Impossibilities, for should we recede from what we
have already done, both God and Man might justly brand us with Infidelity; and
we could almost persuade our selves into a confidence that your spirits are so
Noble, that you scorn to uninterest the English of what is their proper due,
and make our names for (complying with you) to be ingraved in every heart with
the indelable Characters of base perfidiousnesse; But, rather then we will do
it, we will (as we are encouraged by the justness of our cause) prostitute our
selves to the extremity of all miser^s; and this is the sum of our intentions:
To which the Hollander (whose malice boiled for utterance) replied, Since so it
is, that no persuasions will allure you to your own happiness, you must expect
to find the reward of your obstinancy, though we confess it is much against our
inclinations to imbrew our hands in blood; yet rather then we will be frustrate
of our intentions, we are resolved to make a Bonefire of your lland, think not
that the English strenth can stand in competition with ours, for we own them
but as a handful in comparison of our selves, and when our success has
benighted your time, you will confess this truth, and acknowledge your own
follies; in the mean time, go, and be slaves to your own opinions; and know,
that when you find repentance, we may chance to want ears.

Thus this angry dispute being finished, and the Hollanders much incensed and
troubled at the slender effects of their assiduous labors, begin to plot how
to obtain that by foul means, which their seeming fair means could not
accomplish; to which purpose they begin to prepare their Vessel called the
Float with her Battery Gunns, which being done, they forthwith assaulted the
Town, and besides the Float, they brought some other Ships to lie in br^st
against the Town in which our Factory was; At the sight of which, we forthwith
set a Red Cross upon our Factory houses, to signify to them that there was
our abiding place, at the sight whereof the Dutch trebled their former shot
against us, but could no way prevail; but we very easily perceived, it made the
heat of their rage increase into a greater flame; but at last I my self
ventured, and took it down, yet for the space of 2 days they lay battering,
but not to so much purpose as they expected; Now by the way of the water side
in this lower Town, there was a Platform made with three Gunns in it, two
Sak^rs and one Minion, which kept the Hollander at a reasonable distance from
the Town, and all the Town was made up with great broad stones, that there was
neither ingresse, ^or egresse, but only through the upper Town, and this Plat
form in the lower Town was so well manned with Guns by the Bandaneeses, that had
not the Hollanders found some other way to come in, their second endeavors
might have proved as ineffectuall as the first.

The Hollander perceiving how insuccesfull their first attempt was, after two
or three days consi^tion what couries they might best and most safest take;
they began to fit themselves on the last day of February, 1620. and on the 1.
of March following in the morning, about six of the clock, we being up and
ready in our Factory, Mr. Randolph summoned us (as his usual course was) to
come to prayers, prayers being ended, he commanded the Cook to provide
breakfast, which accordingly was done, but it was the last breakfast that ever
that Cook provided for me, for on a sudden there arrived at our ears such a
sallet of outcryes, that made us wish we had eat our breakfast without it, for
the Bandaneeses, which had the charge of the lower Town, saluted us with an
unexpected Alarm, that the Hollanders was landed, and were upon their march
toward the Town, having landed on the West side of the Lantore Island nearest
to a place called Louquee their policy thought it most expedient to land their
st^rnmost Boat first, and so by dedegrees landed all their men without any loss
of blood or men on the Hollanders side: Thus being landed, we presently and
sadly heard the beating of Drums; and looking toward the upper Town, we
discerned the Hollanders Colors; which caused our Colors (in respect of the
suddenness of the business) to retreat to our hearts, and there lie buried till
our Enemies pulled them out, Vi, and Armis; but being now surrounded, and
expecting every hour to groan out our souls, we thought it more convenient to
dye at our doors, thinking that our language might something mitigate the fury
of our new come unwelcome Enemies; but the Hollanders placed in their front, a
Nation called the Iapaneeses, a people of Iapan, but they entered not into our
Factory but beset the houses round; these were all Gun-men, having small Guns
much like our Cullivers, with brass barrels, so these Soldiers called out, and
required us to come out of our houses; or they would shoot us, where they found
us; Then we three Englishmen came to the door; and having presented our selves
before them, they presently stood presented against us, ready to give fire; So
the Fronteers called out unto us, and told us that we must be their prisoners,
to which purpose they took us into custody, strictly examining of us whether
there was no more of us, the tuth is (I thought they had too many of us
already) but in conclusion we told them that we had one Armenian more; so
whilst they were roguishly busy in binding of us, some of their associates
dragged out the poor old Armenia man, whom I thought would have died for fear
of dying, his age being not able to encounter with such youthful Tyfannies;
but in the interi^, I took the boldness to ask my busy workman, which was very
busy in tying my hands, whether the merciless Hollander would trouble
himself so much as to kill us, or no; who replied, and swore a sufficient
Oath, that I should not be killed by any till he had brought me to speak with
the Hollanders; so by these Iapandaries we were brought into the Marketplace
of the lower Town, and there we were commanded to kneel down, so they brought a
Nockedy of a Junck, which is a Master of a Ship, and tied him to my right arm;
and presently came another Iapander, and cut off his head, at which I was
starting up, expecting my own to go next; but my Guardian leapt upon my two
shoulders, and kept me down, so before my face they cut his body into
piecemeals, so that at that time I could not cast my eyes any way, but I sadly
observed them cutting in pieces men, women, and children in the streets, so
that the town was a Shambles of dead men.

Now after eleven of the clock, although we heard nothing more distinctly then
the most lamentable and horrid cries of men, women, and children, being brought
to suffer death by their enemies) we were commanded to march into the upper
Town of Lantore, where the blood-sucking Dutch sat in most Majestic pomp; at
our first appearance before them, we were courteously entertained with the
titles of Rogues, ^ay base Rogues, the basest of all Rogues, except (as I
thought) Dutch Rogues; the second course was Villains, but not Hogen and Mogen
ones; the third was, Traitors to the States of Holland, and to our own King of
England, and that we were most worthy to be hanged out of the way; which words
all of us heard with much regret and distaste, in respect that we could be no
less then confident, that we deserved no such imbittered language from them;
But to come to the business, we three (I cannot say merry men) Englishmen, were
presently condemned to be tied to 3. several posts, but what to do we knew no
more then the posts, till afterward experience made us feel what we were sent
for, being miserably dragged along to the posts, we were most violently tied to
them, insomuch, that the blood was ready to start out of our fingers ends, and
our hands being tormented from their usual colors, looked black, and (as it
were) mourned for the miseries our bodies were like to endure, the extremity of
which tortures made us sadly cry out to be loosed, and our cries were so
prevalent, that it moved them to pity our hands, and punish our necks, for
they a little, and (in truth) but a little loosned our hands, and tied our
necks so close to the posts, that indeed I could hardly persuade my self but
that there was an absolute incorpora^ion between my neck and the united post;
these torments I looked upon as symptoms of an ensuing death, for indeed we
expected it, being tied hands and neck to the posts; but on a sudden the
Heavens frowning at these impieties, sent down such a shower of rain for one
hour and a half, that the like was never before known by any there present; the
Rain surceasing, we three standing all the while (in dispight of our teeths) in
the Rain, desired that we might be once more loosned, for the rain had so much
shrunck up our cords, that they pinched us even unto death; not long after we
were loosned, but had I not seen my hands (which was as much as I could well
do) I had absolutely thought my hands had taken distaste at my body, and so
left me; had our miseries ended here, we had been very happy, in respect of
what followed after; but see the frailty of man, that had rather suffer a
thousand torments, then dye once; I remember it is reported of a great Tyrant,
when any was to dye, he would have as many torments inflicted upon him, as
could be imagined, and being asked the reason he replied, Ut sentiat se mori,
that a man may know he dies: So our Dutch tormentors could not be contented to
afford us great tor^s, but must st^ll study greater, for suddenly after they
placed the old Armenian with us on ^round slippery hill, where we expected to
receive our last punishment, for we were much afraid that the half Pike men
would have forced us down the back side of it into the Ocean, but within half
an hour there came an Order that we should be tied one upon the back of
another, and so carry one another down the better side of the hill; being thus
compelled to obey this cruel command, I took Mr. Randolph and carried him, and
Mr. Gates took the old Armenian, and with great difficulty and pains we got
down without tumbling, hoping when we came at the bottom to have been eased of
our burdens, but we found no such clemency from them, for instead of
abstracting, they largely added to our former miseries, buffiting us with our
burdens fast tied to our backs; and if we asked whether it were the fashion to
use us prisoners in that nature, they would largely answer us in the dumb
language of their unsanctified fi^ts, enforcing us to go with our loads upon
our backs to show them the way out of the Town, we not daring to make the least
resistance, but with seeming content attended their pleasure, and showed them
the place where we used formerly to ease our selves (but could not at the
present of our burdens) the place was 12. foot high, the stones being so laid
one upon another* yet we (like Pedlars with our ware at our backs) were
compelled (I cannot say to crawle over them, in respect we had not the use of
our hands) but by the assistance of my toes, elbows and chin, I for my part got
up to the top of the wall, but Mr. Randolph that was my back friend showed me a
slippery trick (the cord breaking) fell from my back, and I (out of policy,
because I would not take up my burden again) ventured to break my neck, and
fell down on the other side of the wall, but poor Mr. Randolph, that almost
roasted me before with heat in carrying of him, was himself as well basted (for
not making more haste over the wall) as I believe hands could do it, and I am
sure (were he alive to witness it) he would say, that he needed no more basting
in a year after.

Neither was this the Finis of our misery, but as one wave gives place to
another, so did our torments; for coming on the other side of the wall, those
beasts of prey (the Hollander) fastened their paws upon us, and like Lions,
dragged us to their Den, which was a Boat purposely provided to row us to the
Ship called the Holland, which lay near two leagues distant from the place we
were taken, but being attended to the Boat with several curses and stripes, we
(though unwillingly) stepped in but because we should not forget our former
trade, they forthwith took us (only the Armenian excepted) and bound us harder
then before to the thoughts of the Boat, insomuch that through our extremity of
pain, we earnestly implored our Butchers to be so merciful to us, as to cut
our throats, but our pleadings, lamentations, and sad cries, proved music to
their ears, insomuch that instead of compassionating our groans, they laughed to
hear them (^re the Turk is more merciful to his Slaves, then these Tyrants were
to us poor naked men: At last we came to the Ship called the Holland, where we
were presently enquired after by those in the Ship, at whose enquire and
command we were charged to climb up by a roap into the Ship, but for the
present neither of us was able to touch a Ropes end to hoist our selves up, but
sat bem^aning of our selves, lamenting to think how perpetually they had lamed
us; but at last the Provost of the Ship commanded some of his men to come into
the Boat, and hand us in by main strength; being thus shipped, the Provost
condemned us every one to a several place of suffering; as for me, I was
placed at the Beeck head of the Ship, a place where they could not come to ease
themselves at Natures Costomehouse, but I must take the scent of their tails,
and I am confident they took delight (and I fear some of them took physic
purposely) to visit me, and after their visitation they would go upon their
Fore-Castle, and laugh, vomiting forth raylings against the English, expressing
their Affection which they bear to our Nation; this I understood because I was
skillful in their speech; Thus sat I in this surreverentiall posture chained
to my seat, and the other two were chained, one at the Lar bote catt-head, and
the other at the Stare-bote catt-head of the ship; We were thus kept assunder,
because if any of the Bandaneeses could or would justify that we had been upon
the plat-forme in resistance against the Hollander, then our necks had paid for
the offense of our hands; but GOD be praised, none of them could, or would
justify it.

In this sorrowful, and lamentable condition we three Englishmen lay (well
may the Reader judge) to our little profit, but less ease, for the Sun lying
within five degrees of those Islands, cast such penetrating rays upon us, that
had we not spent much grease before, we might well expected to have been almost
melted, but the night coming on, we found an alteration, by reason that in
Nero Road the vapors ascend from the sea, the moistness whereof (had not the
Almighty Protector defended us from it) had been sufficient to have suffocated
us, or else to have furnished us with sicknesses sufficient to have put a
period to our sufferings, for very few that dye in those parts, dye of any
other disease, then the Fever, or the Flux; and that which added something
more to our miseries, was, that none of us had any thing to protect us from the
boards, or detect us, either from the violent heat by day, or the vapourous
cold by night; and again, I am confident, we were so odious to the Dutch, that
not any of them were guilty of so much commiseration, as to furnish us with the
least of any thing that might add comfort to our distress, only this most
horrible comfort we should constantly have intruded into our ears, that within
two days more, a rope should be our Physician (but we could not perswad them,
(that were sick of Tyranny) to use it themselves) some of them would often
flatter us to our faces, and say, That no men in the world would become a
halter, like an Englishman.

Judge then (Judicious Reader) how dissonant these expressions were to our
depressed Spirits; and I beseech you, let your serious consideration reflect
upon their Tyrannyes and our extremeties, think but how feelingly we were
lashed into misery, and when we thought that our complaints would have induced
them to be compassionate, their dispositions were so contaminated with
Barbarism, that their joys were as exuberous as our sorrow; May not these
enormeties well prove Arguments to invite us to believe, That if their Power
were correspondent to their sanguine thoughts, we should find them worse
Taskmasters, then ever experience made the Hebrews find from the hands of the
Egyptians; And for my own part, I seriously Protest, that if it pleased the
Great Determiner of all things, to command me to yield my body to be tormented,
I had far rather choose the Turks, then the Dutch Tortures, for the cruelty of
their mercyes, I am confident, are far transcending the Turkish extremeties,
and I know that their Viperous inclinations toward us would not be consumated,
till completed fury riotts it self into an unparaleld revenge; Yet, had the
People (which are too much ebrietated with Malice) but so much consideration,
as to remember how many eminent favors our Nation has formerly accumulated
upon them, sure they could not but ingenuously confess, their dissabillity to
compensate our deserts, but their Ingratitude has been our reward, Sed de his,
satis, quia ingratos dixi; but I will here desist from progressing any further
into their ingratitude, and return to my former subject.

Being (as I have formerly told you) thus carbonadoed in our bodies, and sadly
perplexed in our minds, we began to ruminate what course we might best take to
procure some ease to our distressed and distempered selves; And after a short
pause, we thought it convenient to persuade our enemies to furnish us with pen,
ink and paper, that in a Petitionall way we might express our minds to the
chief in the ship, called Holland; the effect whereof was, That (in respect of
our daily vexations and troubles, our bodies were very much impaired, and our
hearts dejected) we desired so much favor from the chief of them, as to be a
little freed from our chains, and obtain so great a privilege, as to walk or
sit between the Decks of the ship, that so our bodies and minds might find
the comfort of a short relaxation; After some consideration, our hearts were
exhillerated with the news of our release, we (being forthwith taken from our
Irksome Chains) began to conceit our selves into a strange kind of happiness,
but this happiness, as it was soon obtained, so it as soon expired, for we were
forthwith (through their goodness and clemency) commanded to be put into a
great bolt of Iron, about Eight foot long at the least, insomuch that we were
forced to be idle because we could not stir, but only sit upon the Deck, and
God knows, we had enough of that before, if their pleasures would have given
them leave to consider it; but they that felt no misery themselves, knew not
how to commiserate ours, yet the extent of their favors was such, that every
other day we were severally brought out of our bolts, but not for our ease, but
for their pleasures, for we were compelled every one of us severally to answer
to certain Interrogatories, insomuch that if they had found us in several
tales, England had never heard this sad truth from my mouth: but our constant
sitting and lying grew so tedious to us, that we thought it convenient to
Petition them again for ease, yet we were something doubtful in respect of
our former Success, but the violence of our Sufferings strengthened our
intentions, and we resolved to Petition, that we might find so much favor
from their hands, as to be reinchained, and permitted to walk above, or below
the Decks, as our Chains should permit, and our occasions require; our
Petition being granted, we were acquitted of our troublesome Bolt, but new
Torments (like the Hydra's heads) presently succeeded the old; we were no
sooner out of our Bolts, but we were presently exalted, and carried up, and set
in the heat and cold as formerly; neither was that all, for our legs were
forthwith salluted with a Bolt of about a foot long, with both our knees wrung
together so hard, that our Torments may better be imagined, then expressed, our
conditions were so lamentable, that we could not so much as stir our bodies
from the place where we lay, but with miserable content we were constrained to
undergo our extreamities; In this most deplorable condition we continued the
space of 48 hours, unpittied by those merciless Neroes; being in extremity of
pain, we earnestly importuned them for the possession of our great Bolts
again, which request was accordingly granted, and we put in lawful possession
by them, where we remained complete 16 days, hearing nothing so much, as the
dialects of hanging and tortering, which must needs be very placent to our
distressed hearts: Being thus almost worn out with Sufferings, one of my
miserable associats (over-burthened with Oppression) was deprived of his
health, and with an extreme Flux, was very much debilletated in his body, Mr
^dolph all this while kept himself in a good condition of health, and so
continued; as for my self, I thank my Great Preserver (GOD) I continued in
health, and was aegrotus animo magis quam corpore, more imbecill in mind then
body; but one thing I cannot without praise to God, and admiration, omit to
recite, which is, That in the space of 21 days, I never enjoyed the benefit of
Nature more then four times, and yet all the while was very sane in my body:
but as for my concometant, Mr. Gates, he was in the time of his sickness most
sadly used by them in respect of his often necessity, being troubled with an
exceeding Flux; these incomparable Villans, in the absence of the Provose,
would not let this poor man out of the Bolts, but compelled him to use the
Platter wherein we constantly eat our meat; these things were very unsavery to
us, yet these inhumane Creatures would not in the least be sensible of our
callamities; thus we lay sadly wasting our tedious and tiresom hours, expecting
every minute to have heard the tidings of death, but the hand of heaven
restrained them, and as our sins led us into these sufferings, so His hand of
Mercy afterward led us out, which follows, and will forthwith fall into our
Relation.

In those parts, there lies a Road, known by the name of Nero Road, the
coming in whereof lies to the Westward between Goonape and Lantore Island,
which is the largest Island in Banda; This Nero Road is surrounded with
Islands, having only a Passage out of the East and West toward Rose and Gang
Island, over against the Island of Lantore; there is also another Island, near
adjacent, which is called, Poulee Swanga, which I make mention of in respect of
the name, which signifies, being interpreted, the Island of Devils, and may
well be so called, because of the sterilitie, both of fruit, and People; but to
come to my story; Into this Nero Road came sailing two of our English Ships
bound for the East Indies, the one was the Exchange, the other the Star, these
ships having been in the Road about two or three days, their Commanders were
informed what the Dutch had acted in Lantore, and how they had some English
Prisoners amongst them, which English Prisoners, One Captain Fitch Herbert sent
to demand (which the reader may please to conceive was no small joy to us
miserable Captives) upon whose demand, the Dutch forthwith unbolted us, and
sent us away, we not so much rejoicing at our departure, as they did at our
former miseries; We being arrived at the English ships, word was presently
carried into the ship called the Ch^ge, to Captain Fitch Harbert, that the
English Prisoners were coming aboard, the News being thus reported, we were
commanded into the Cabin, where we were examined by Captain Fitch Herbert
concerning our being taken, and our usage by the Dutch; to whom I replied, That
the Dutch used us like themselves, which was, like Tyrants, and that he might
easily perceive by our decrippednesse what course entertainment we found
amongst them; after we had made the full Relation of every particular; he
forthwith discharged us, without adding any relief to our manifold wants, which
indeed very much troubled us, but he was pleased (a purpose to be rid of us) to
give us liberty and leave to go to Pulleroone as soon as we could get any
Passage, for which favor, we gave him a parcel of such thanks as we thought
the courtesy merrited.

THE SECOND PART OF THE Dutch Tyrannyes.
THE Wind having unseated it self, and left its Western Court, where it had
continued constant five Months, whirls about, and salutes Flora with an
Eastern and comfortable blast, March having breathed its last for that year,
April succeeded, which Month we spent at Nalacco Island, where our houses were
seated; not many weeks after arrived the Ship, called the Exchange, and came to
Pullaroon and Nalacco to see what men would go Westward; I being one that was
willing to go, forthwith went aboard, and from thence sailed to Amboyna, which
was thirty ^eagues distant, W^stward from Banda, at which place we spent a
complete Months time, and after set Sail and came for the Mulouca Islands,
where our stay was no longer then whilst we could settle our Factories, it
being Gods great mercy that I stayed not amongst them; after that, we came to
Turnate to the Turnatians, with whom we wasted a Month more, and afterward we
came back to an Island called Mockan, that lies under the Line, which Island
contains a Castle, which Castle contains a pair of Stocks, which pair of
Stocks contained me; for truly I think that those well-sented Hollanders
thought I smelt so much of misery, and that I was fit for nothing else, for
indeed my stay had not been long in that place before they sent a crew of ill
look people with Swords and Gunns, I thought at first to kill me, but it fell
out otherwise (I thank God) for they only sufficiently beat me, and dived into
my well-furnished pockets, and (I hope the Reader will imagine) took away my
money, for truly, I thought it a piece of vanity to put my hand in after theirs
came out, neither had I heart to do it, in respect I was confident to find a
strange vacuety there; neither would my money ^ice them, but they must also
endeavor to beat me out of my clothes, which indeed much ^ubled my ^nscience,
yet at last they buffited me into a very unwilling confession wh^re I had laid
them, and some other goods, which I brought with me; thus (I cannot say they
left me, but I became) moneyless, and clotheless, to my great grief, and their
no small profit; In this posture of poverty they forthwith dragged me to their
(Inquisition) the Castle, where I found entertainment answerable to my
expectation, for they were not endued with so much manners as to make a poor
man drink for his money, no nor for my clothes neither, but immediately (as if
I had been born to no other purpose) they sent me sadly to the Stocks, where I
sat, more likely to sigh my heart out, then my legs; my rugged lifeguard
leaving me, I begun to ruminate upon my misfortunes, and having thought my self
into a world of misery, I began to wish my heels at liberty, but my wishes were
no way prevalent; at length, having defategated my spirits with tedious and
troublesome Meditations, I endeavored to rouse up my drooping heart, informing
my self, that the more I repined, the greater addition I gave to my sorrow, and
that I must labor to crown my sufferings with patience, remembering that
although the Sun is overshadowed with more then one cloud in a day, yet
conquers them at last, and although his resplendent rays often suffers an
obnubelation, yet his primitive and pristine glory is no way extenuated, only
the world suffers a momentary deprivation: So a m^n in affliction, although his
external parts are veyl'd with misery, yet his internal quallities retain (nay
sometimes more then their usual vigor) and are insensible of any deminution;
with these and such like cogitations I satiated my thoughts, and hugged my
bitter-sweet afflictions; but at length d^iring to sollace my fancy with new
objects, my eyes took a survey of the situation of the Castle, but suddenly I
discry'd a parcel of Musketeers coming toward m^, the sight whereof made me
suspicious that I should forthwith breath my last, for I expected nothing more
then immediate death, but the event proved the contrary, for upon their nearer
approach to me I observed, that it was a prisoner they had taken, and were
bringing him to be my associate, I confess I was miserably joyful to see him,
in respect he was an Englishman of my acquaintance, but grieved to think of his
being in the hands of such Butchers, indeed they were so civil to me (that
although he proffe^ed me the upper hand in the Stocks, yet they told me, I
deserved it, because I was (by their approbation, and appellation) the elder
Ro^gue: Thus we two late lovingly in the Stocks together, bewailing our ^ad
misfortunes, but my stomach began to importune me for meat, having been in the
Stocks all night, I may very well be excused for being both hungry and thirsty;
but it is far easier for a man to complain, then to be relieved; therefore I
gave my appetite an unwelcome check, and feasted my self with content, which is
but a mean satisfaction to a raging stomach.

About 8. or 9. of the clock in the morning, our Castle-C^ers were pleased to
recreate themselves toward us, but our fear instructed us to believe it was
rather to abuse us, then to give us a breakfast; being come within the audit of
a distinguishable voice, they merrily made enquiry after our healths, and we as
sadly told them, that we were only weary with our tedious sitting, and at that
time our stomachs were more agile then our legs; upon this (I know not whether
out of pity or malice) they were pleased to lend us the use of our legs again,
but were very careful that we should not abuse them, and to that purpose
betrayed us into the custody of a Guard of Musketeers, which promoted us into
an upper room in the Castle, where we stayed till we heard the welcome news of
some that made enquiry after us, these enquirers being safely and honorably
conducted to our presence chamber by our guard, we cheerfully saluted them, and
gave them such welcome entertainment as our Palace would afford us; we gave
them audience, and by the sequel of their discourse, we gathered, that they
came from our Ship to make enquiry after us, which news was no less welcome,
then gratefully accepted; after a short ^rley with them, ^e began to assume
cheerful countenances; but our winter sufferings craved a flood, insomuch that
we earnestly importuned our new come friends, to fetch us a little water, that
we might wash away our sorrows with cold comfort; the water being brought, we
lovingly tippled to one another; these ceremonies being past, our friends began
to deport themselves into a posture of departing, and we (not much inviting them
to stay, in respect we had entreated them to bring some victuals from the
Ship) courteously bid them farewell; Thus they departed, leaving us behind,
accompanied with our sorrows, and miserable stomachs, whilst our Cormorant ^ard
Tantali^ ^d us with their unmannerly eating and drinking before our fa^s,
deriding and mocking at our hunger, whilst we were forced to wish that they had
either no meat, or we no stomachs; By this time our friends were arrived at the
Ship, where they informed our Captain of our ill usage with the Dutch, who
indeed was very apprehensive of our sufferings, and forthwith commanded them to
return to us with relief, and charged them to visit us daily about 8. of the
clock, much admiring, and incensed at the conflagrations of their malice
toward us, willing them to ask whether it was the Dutch fashion to use their
prisoners with so much Tyranny and unparalleled Barbarism: About 12. of the
clock we were informed of the approach of our friends, but they entering, our
stomachs for the present would not permit our tongues to express our thanks
equable to their deserts; but after we had indifferently quallified and allayed
the vigor of our memorable appetites, we began to unbosome our selves to them,
expressing our grateful acceptance of so welcome, (though so long absent) a
favor; whilst we were thus humouring of our much implacable natures, our
friends seemed to be in a serious consultation with our Guards, enquiring and
descanting upon the reason of so much severity toward us Englishmen; and why
they should, upon so slender an account, as the buying of Cloves upon their
Island, use so much violence against those Captives they had taken, telling
them how disproportionable it was to a good conscience, which actions (if
continued) would make them an odium to all Nations; these words seemed (as
indeed they were) very unsavouly to their turbulant spirits; for they had so
much habituated themselves to villainy and bas^ness, that custom had made it
too inherent for a remoall; I will not expend so much time as to make a
Narrative of their responds, in respect I intend to hasten to what shall be
more material.

This day we spent with indifferent ease and contentment, but the night
approaching, and our friends being departed from us, we began to think of rest,
wondering where they intended to dispose of us that night, for we thought that
they would not trust us in that room without a Guard; but our admiration was
quickly converted in a complete satisfaction, for before night had absolutely
spread abroad her ^able Curtains, there came a Dutch Fury, attended with ^our
Musketeers, and commanded me to take my leave of my fellow captive, and so
violently took me away from him, and carried me to the East side of the Castle,
and left Matthew Sawell, my former Companion, on the West side, and planted two
Musketeers at each of our doors all the while we were in their custody, which
was about 8. days, all which time we lay upon the boards, being not allowed by
them any thing to sustain us, no not so much as water; the next day our friends
coming to supply our wants, wondered to see us at such a distance one from
another, demanding of us the reason of our separation; but our slender
knowledge could not satisfy their demands, but we were forced with as much
patience as we could to endure all their sad impulsives, and I bless and praise
my great Redeemer, that he has been thus graciously pleased to spare my life,
and hand me out from all these eminent and depraved extremities, which I hope
will never be oblittered out of my serious mind; And I hope God will be pleased
to preserve our English Nation from all their plots and Tyrannies threatened, to
my knowledge against us; for I am confident the Spaniard in 88. never intended
to impose more cruelty upon us then these (let it satisfy that I know not what
to call them:) I will therefore assume so much boldness, as to speak a word or
two to our Nation, though I know some will condemn, what other by experience
will sadly acknowledge: In short, I know them experimentally, to be a people of
most operative spirits; and had I a Tragical design to act, I should as soon
employ them in it (provided it may tend to their gain) as the best Jesuit now
living, for I know them to be such undermining and insinuating people, that
like the Crocadile, they are most destructive, when they shed most tears; and
for my own part, I had inured my self to believe least, when they spoke most;
nay, in conclusion, neither to believe little or much of their traditions; they
are Lions, if Conquerours, but Spannels if conquered; And truly I dare not
believe but that they are very joyful of this opportunity to fall out with us
English, for I have heard them for many precedent years declare, that they
would show us, what Dutchmen were if ever they could find convenience to put
their designs in agitation; I hope the Reader will be so favorable to me, as
not to conceive that I declare any thing out of malice or base ends; for I
protest, and am ready at any time to justify it with my life, that I have not
expressed any thing but what is really correspondent to truth, and I am very much
assured, that there be those now living that can testify with me how many
Tragical designs, that have not only been acted upon us, but upon many
others, which are now too tedious to recite, I shall therefore return to my
former Discourse.

By this time, the Reader may be pleased to conjecture, that our 8. days
sufferings begins to draw to a conclusion, for our Captain sent to the
Holanders to demand his prisoners, for he intended next day to set Sail, and
leave those parts; the Holander upon our Captains command, gave Order for our
enlargement, so we were brought down into the Castle-yard, having nothing upon
us but our natural habits, for they stripped us before; but in our march, we
observed a Gallery, in which were placed the chief of the Castle and Island,
before whom we were forthwith called; being approached near unto them, they
willed us to express whether we were willing to go aboard our Ship; we replied,
that indeed it was our hearty desires, if we might be permitted, for it was but
slender comfort for us to be slaves, if our Liberties might be permitted, but
the poverty of our condition was such that we ^ere inf^rced to express to them
what an obligation they would lay upon us, if they would prove but so favorable
to us as to command our clothes and goods to be re-delivered unto us, which we
were deprived by their appointment, to which they suddenly replied, that our
prayers would be as prevalent and effectual for them with our goods, as with
them, so wished us to continue in that mind of praying; for they told us, that
we being at their disposal, they might as well hang, as release us, and as yet
they were in suspense, whether life or death were most sutabale to your
deserts; these words dropping from their tongues, which we knew were so well
furred with malice, put us into such an ecstasy, that we yielded our selves to
be l^st men; but after some mature deliberation, they were pleased to let us
know, that in respect we were the first Englishmen that ever they took buying
of Cloves upon their Island; they were willing to spare our lives; but if ever
they should hereafter take an Englishman in the same nature, they would not be
so favorable as to hang them, but to whip them to death; the pronunciation of
this cruel sentence, I heard distinctly fall from their mouths, with many
other calumnies, and violent railings against us, so that as before they had
dragged us into their Den, now they rayl'd us out, from whence we. forthwith
repaired to our Ship, where we found civil and courteous entertainment from
our Captain, who was very much inc^nsed to hear the sad relation of our
Captivity; I shall once more inform the Reader, what I have heard these borish
people express, which was to this effect; Alas, said they, what is England, if
compared to our High and Mighty States of the Netherlands, we know that we
have Ships enough to block up all the English Ports, and if any difference should
arise, the proof should manifest the truth: I have often known them to be ^o
inhumane as to take Vessels from the Chinay-men, and rob them of their goods,
and at last drown the poor men; by such means many of these sicophants have
mightily enriched themselves; neither was this sufficient to qualify their
avarcious hearts, but also many Indies Ships besides, as Weddals and Carters,
and many other which I could nominate, have been pillaged by them.

One inhumane action more of these bloody Hollanders I shall not forbear to
relate, with as much truth and exactness as possible; and I hope the judicious
Reader will please to favor me so much as to give credence to my report, which
shall not in the least syllable deviate from truth; and if my own testimony
will not be sufficient, I can have it justified by one Bryan Beddoes, a managed
about ^o. who lives not far dist^nt from London: The sum of what I intend is
this. One Captain Bali being President of Bantam in the year 1617. was desired
to give entertainment to some Bandaneeses, which were newly arrived, and
desired to address themselves to him; the request being civil, was a civilly
granted, and they were permitted to present themselves before our Governor,
being thus entertained, they began to enter into a parley; the Bandaneeses
being come from all the Islands of Banda, brought with them a pawn or a pledge
to present to Captain Ball, relating to him the Barbarism and severity of the
Dutch toward them, and how they daily exacted upon them and murdered them at
their pleasures, absing their wives, whilst they themselves looked on, and dared
not in the least resist them; moreover, their abominable drunkenness made them
daily riot into all manner of misdemeanors, insomuch that at last they had
made it such a customary thing, that it was (no less then wonderful) to see
them sober, and the truth is, they do so much bestiate themselves that they
naturallize ^briety, and make themselves the sink of baseness; for these and the
like reasons, the distressed Bandaneeses earnest ly requested Captain Ball,
that he would be pleased so far to compassionate their sorrowful conditions,
as to accept of their Gage, and receive their Islands into his jurisdiction,
and defend them from the Tyrannies of the intruding and unmercifull Hollander,
the weight of whose oppressions were beyond the strength of their endurance;
therefore if he would accept of what they proffered, he would very much unslave
them, and as they believed no way prejudice himself, nor our English Nation: To
which Captain Ball replied, that in regard they had given (as he conceived)
their Island already to the Dutch, it was no way agreeable to reason, for him
to take away that by force from the Dutch, which they had obtained by favor;
therefore he desired them to cease their importunity: To which the Bandaneeses
generally replied, That if that were all the obsticle, it might easily be
removed, for they protested that they never gave the least consent to the
Hollander to possess their Islands, but that they voluntarily and violently
came into their Island without their privety or consent, and had oftentimes
desired, but never received any Pawn, or Gage from them; and besides, the
baseness of their actions deterred them from doing any such thing, neither
would they ever condescend to any of their persuasions; therefore they
earnestly desired Captain Ball forthwith to accept of their Pawn, and become
their Protector; Captain Ball being satisfied in his former doubt, became
willing to accept the Pawn, to the great joy, and much comfort of the afflicted
Bandaneeses.

The Bandaneeses at the news of Captain Balls acceptance of their Island,
rouzd themselves into a great allacrity, returning him as many thanks as could
possibly be imagined, withal telling him, that for his many civilities
bestowed upon them, they were bound by the ties of friendship to requite them
according to their best abilities, and that their lives and fortunes should
always wait upon the English: Captain Ball perceiving their integrity, and
observing with how much reality they expressed themselves, told them, that in
respect they had so voluntarily and freely thrown themselves upon his
protection, he would truly endeavor to defend and vindicate them from the fury
of the Dutch, and that a short time should produce the effects of his
intentions, to which purpose he resolved forthwith to prepare three Ships,
namely the Solomon, the Thomas, and the Tendance, to go for Mucassa, there to
take in their loading of Rice and Rack, and so to stand for the Banda Islands;
this forenamed Captain Ball continued President till the arrival of Captain
Iourdan, who came with Sir Thomas Dails Fleet in the year 1618. at which time
Capt. Ball was commanded home, notwithstanding we proceeded in our Voyage,
although the Dutch had made a protest against all the Englishmen and Ships that
they could meet withal to the East ward of the Straits of Desselon, but we
little regarding that, kept on our course, and in a short time anchored at
Mucassa, and in three weeks after we were all ready to set Sail from Mucassa,
to the Straits of Desselon; being at last all fitted, we weighed Anchor, and
set Sail, having in our Ships about 80. Bandaneeses, whereof 40. was in the
Ship called the Thomas, in which Vessel I my self sailed, our Ship being the
first that arrived at (and went through) those Straits, and yet never came
within view of the Banda Islands that year, but landed our Bandaneeses at an
Island known by the name of Borough, which is a Clove Island, near adjacent to
that most fatal Island of Amboyna; as for the two other Ships, the Solomon and
the Tendance, which were in company with us, they staying and trifling away
their time longer then convenient, the wind chopped against them, that they could
not come after us through the Straits of Desselon, but were descryed by the
Hollander (who lay purposely to entrap us) and were taken by them, and kept
there according to their protest made at Bantam; in the mean time we being out
of the Straits of Desselon, standing off from Batto^, fell upon the shoules of
Tym^re, where we remained some time; but the Reader may please to take notice,
that in respect of the danger we apprehended of Banda, we were enforced to
leave our Bandaneeses at Borough, where we desired the Inhabitants to provide
them Prooes, or small Boats, to transport them to their Island, which they
promised to perform, but what the Dutch did with those poor creatures, we could
better imagine, then be informed; for we could never hear, neither could the
Inhabitants conceive what became of them.

The next ensuing year we sailed again with Captain Iackson for Mucassa in a
small Pinnace of about 30. or 40. Tun, called the Frances, and in her we also
had Bandaneeses; so that year it pleased the overruling Providence to send us
safe with all our lading into a place called Pulloroon, where we reiterated the
unsuccesfulness of our former years Voyage; but our discretions invited us to
say with Seneca, Sera parsomonea in fundo est; but having set our Bandaneeses
on shore, and the Westwardly Months season being spent, we forthwith steered
away for the Island of Tiddore, which was seated in the Mu^uckees, being
arrived thither, we immediately began to make our best Market of our goods, and
sold all our Rice that we could spare to the Spaniards, and the Tiddorians, at
as good a rate for ready money as we could desire; And the King of that Island
affecting one of our Sakers, gave us for it the equal weight of it in Cloves,
desiring to have one or two more, but we could not conveniently spare them, so
we craved excuse, having thus vended our Commodities, and stored our selves
with what we thought most convenient for our u^e; in six weeks after we weighed
Anchor, and stood away for Bantam, and sailed along the Sal^oe Coast, which is
the backside of the Land of Mucassa, where we put into a small Port, called
the Boohoole, which we afterward named the Pu^pkin-Bay, because of its
fertility in bearing of Pumpkins, for there we bought 500 for a faddam of Blue
Bafta Callieo, which is Sarrat Cloth; at the same rate also we bought Hogs and
brought them to our Boat; being thus victualled we forthwith set Sail for
Bantam, whither the blessing of a favorable wind not long after brought us,
though with a miserable Leakey Ship.

After a seasonable respit at Bantam, Sir Thomas Daile (a man whose worth and
honor cannot be out-famed) thought it convenient to provide a small Navy; and
sail toward Iackatray, where the Hollanders lay; to which purpose he caused
the Thomas, that we sailed to Bantam in, to be made and fitted into a fire Ship
(in which Ship I was one) which was speedily done; and after all things were
in a convenient posture, we hoysted Sail, and away we steered toward
Iackatray, where the Dutch had a Castle, being come right overagainst it, we
presently discovered 8. ^ayle of the Holanders, upon fight whereof our Noble
and valiant Sir Thomas Daile bore up to them, and after some smoaky
salutations, the Hollander began to bid us farewell, though they had 8. Ships
to our 7, after the nimble Dutch found themselves suffici^y been, and were
gone, Sir Thomas instantly w^nt ashore and demanded the Castle, and plant^d his
Gunns about it, but the King of that Country after the surrender of the Castle
to Sir Thomas, stood upon terms (believing that Sir Thomas Dail had for ever
beaten the Dutch) and demanded to have half of what was in the Castle, men and
all, telling Sir Thomas Dail, that he could take the Castle without his
assistance; To which Sir Thomas replied, That the Kings demands were too
unreasonable to be granted, in respect that he could in no way answer it unto
his Master the King of England, for although the Dutch had by their villainous
and most detested actions so much unchristianized themselves, yet he dared not
so much outrun his Commission, as to deliver them to a Heathen; To which a
sudden Reply was made, that Sir Thomas Dail need not insist upon such a nicety,
^r if the Dutch had conquered the English, it might well be imagined that the
Dutch would have easily and quickly condescended to the Kings Proposalls; to
which Sir Thomas returned this answer. That the actions of the Dutch were
insufficient rules ^r him to walk by, for he could not think it expedient for
him to act an evil, though it were licensed by other men's consciences, neither
could he so much derogate from the Principles of his Religion, as to patronize
so heinous a deed, so desired excuse; at which words the King, overwarm'd with
passion, told Sir Thomas, That if he would not incline himself to the former
Proposalls, he should forthwith draw off his Artillery, and be gone, for he had
strength enough of his own to take the Castle at his pleasure.

Sir Thomas perceiving the intentions and resolutions of the King, rather then
he would burden his conscience with such a sin, re-delivered the Castle into
the hands of the Dutch, wishing them to make the best defense they could for
themselves, withal, willing them to take notice that it was more his duty to
God and his King, then their deserts, that instructed him to be so favorable;
for he confessed to them, that as often as he ruminated upon their baseness and
cruel exactions toward the English, his thoughts were so much accuated with
revenge, that had they not been un-edg'd by a diviner Power, they might well
have expected a reward proportionable to their merits, hoping that this
civility and elemency which he had used toward them, would hereafter persuade
them into more lenity and moderation; so leaving them to their considerations,
he departed, and from thence addressed himself to the King and his Council to
whom he most courteously, and to this effect expressed himself.

I am very much grieved that ye should be so much your own oppressors, as to
refuse a good so much conducing to your welfares, and out of an avaritious
disposition become your own subverters; you complained of their oppression,
informing me, that the most that you can present, they think too small for
their acceptance, yet you cont^mn a salve for your grievances; ye complain of
their abominable and unheard of ^riety, telling me, that when they are
insaniatiated with superstuous cups, they vomit out more fury then you are able
to digest, yet you despise those streams which may wash away those enormities:
You complain of their uncorrected lasciviousness, and say, that they enforce
your Wives and daughters to be unwilling prostitutes to their lusts, yet you
disown that curb which may restrain their lasciviousness, thus ye make your
selves more slaves, and them more Tyrants; for be assured, that if ever they
prevail so much as to come amongst you (as I am confident they will shortly
endeavor) they will make you perpetually unhappy, insomuch that your lives will
be greater burdens to you, then ever they were before; so I leave you, future
time may ripen your beliefs, though present persuasions can find no harbor.

Thus our renowned Commander having treated this Heathen King, and found all
his labor and and pains to be ineffectuall, forsook the place, and repaired
to his Fleet, where he was received with welcome and joy, or joyful
vvelcomness, where for a time I left him, being desirous to give the Reader a a
true and full relation of a piece of as most exact Tyranny as ever the Devil
was owner of; I know the World is very much inclinaable to censure, therefore
some may wonder, and many may be very apt to say; Alas, how is it possible for
me being aged, to retain all these things in my memory, so many years being
expired since they were agitated; to which I shall in short reply, Scripta diu
remanent, things written, remain long, which if but observed, are subject to
oblivion; the truth is, that at opportune times, I always committed my
sufferings, losses, travels, and things memorable to paper, which is the best
remembrancer, and although it has been a long time buried in loose sheets, yet
it retains as much truth as if it had been then printed; and if it shall be
demanded why I had not then printed it, I shall (though bluntly) say, the
reason is, because then was then, and now is now; for in those days our Nation
was at peace with the Dutch, and had I then printed it, I should rather have
incurred the repute of an Incendiary, then a true Historian; and besides my
urged occasions, and daily employments beyond Sea, would not permit me to
borrow so much time as to digest it according to my desires; if these Arguments
will not prevail, I must submit to the censure of the World, but before I
proceed. I shall only make this short Protestation, That I have neither
spoken, or will speak any thing out of malice or envy, although I must confess
my losses and miserable sufferings might well induce me to thoughts of revenge,
but that I will leave to the great Revenger of all wrongs, and proceed to my
intentions.

Now the season inviting us, we are sent again to the Banda Islands, whither I
sailed with Captain Iackson, leaving Sir Thomas Dail at Iackatray, upon which
Islands I stayed the revolution of two whole years, so that my long abode
there, and my daily observations both of the people and the Islands, will not
permit me to bury the perfect knowledge of them in oblivion, neither dare I
suffer my Memory to be so treacherous to me, as not to be mindful, and sadly
studious of those many and almost unutterable cruelties which were inflicted
upon these poor Bandaneeses by those Monsters of men, the Hollanders, for no
other cause nor ground, but because their affections were so generally and
fervently expressed toward the English, I shall therefore neither add, nor
diminish, but truly and punctually relate as sad a truth as ever Villains
acted, or Innocents endured.

It has been formerly related how the Dutch in the year, 1620. put those
Lant^rians they could not take to flight, enforcing them to forsake their Towns
and Houses, and fly into the highest hills in that Island of Lantore, until
they submitted themselves to their terrible mercy, the Dutch promising them that
if they would speedily submit, they should find them merciful; upon the
hearing of this, these distressed people submitted (though some of them) with
much temerity, in respect they knew how customary it was for them to violate
their promises, nay their oaths, and how their pretended mercy was but the
abstract or quintescence of all torments; the sense of this made them much
mistrustfull of their mercy, which indeed (the preceding discourse will tell
us) they had much reason to doubt thereof.

These miserable people having tendered themselves into the hands of their
enemies, were forthwith received with much joy and seeming allacrety, and
immediately were transported to Neroe Island, where being come the Hollander
caused 400. of the chiefest of them to be picked out, this being accordingly
done, they caused them to wash themselves; after which Ceremony they provided
large store of the primest Provision they could get, and with much love and
amity entreated them really persuaded of their free welcome, telling them that
they hoped the future time should be spent in a more amicable way then the
former; and as for their parts, they heartily wished, and desired their safety
and welfare, and that they should always find them very willing to befriend
them against all opposers, and were heartily sorry that they should so much
distrust them, as to fly to the English for relief; but as they never much
valued it, so they would now study to forget it, desiring that all differences
whatsoever might be absolutely composed, and all former injuries and
discourtesies might be perpetually oblitterated, to which intent and purpose
they had transported them thither, and provided necssaries for their
refreshment.

These Lantorians hearing with how much serenity, and (as they thought)
candidnesse, they delated their affections, could not (as might well be
imagined) but with much joy return them innumerable thanks for the expressions
of their bounty, and the bounty of their expressions; for indeed they having
been much time distressed for want of provision, could not but conceive
themselves to be very happy, finding so much plenty, where they might rather
have expected the abundance of sufferings, then provisions, in respect of their
former obst^nancy, and opposition against them:

Thus the cheerful Lantorians sat discoursing and feeding, being almost
overjoyed for their happy and welcome entertainment, not knowing how
sufficiently to retaliate such overgrown courtesies: Their Feast being ended,
the Dutch and the Bandaneeses began to pi^r, which word being interpreted,
signifies talking, or discoursing; the Hollander all this while accoasting them
in a very civil and unusual manner, to the admiration and much comfort of the
Bandaneeses; but alas! this happiness proved shorter liv^d then was expected.

After they had satisfied their appetites, and expressed their thankfulness to
the Dutch, they prepared themselves for their departure, but the Dutch having
(as it were) thus fatned them for the slaughter, told them, that they must be
presented with another course before they parted, so leading the^ to a Window,
told them that they must walk to yonder Green place, and there receive their
deaths from the hands of their Executioners, who were purposely provided to
dispatch them; this unexpected News made such a sudden alteration in the
countenances of the poor Lantorians, that they forthwith cried out, O apetow!
which is to say, Oh what is this! the Reader may judge what a terror this
unexpected News struck to their hearts, which but even now were as joyful, as
joy could make them, and no^ by a fatal stroke are cut off from all their
mirth, and frightened into as much sorrow, as is p^sible to be imagined; but
there is no remedy, neither the abundance of tears, nor their lamentable
aspects, nor their reitterated entreaties could prevail, they are designed for
destruction, and they must dye, to which purpose, they carried them to the
place of Execution, where they were cruelly received by the Iaponeeses, and
severally taken and cut in the middles alive, their Quarters being divided,
they were sent some to Lantore, and some to other places, and set them up in
the streets; was not this pure mercy, to dispatch those poor Creatures quickly,
that no more cost nor charges might arise upon the maintenance of them? and
after such fair and (seeming courteous) entertainment, to exact their lives for
the payment of their Ordinaries; this Tragedy was acted in the Year 1621, since
which time (and I believe hardly before) was the like cruelty heard of, neither
was this the conclusion of their revenge, as I shall to my best endeavor
forthwith relate.

In the same year 1621, these blood-thirsty men sent over to Pullaroone for the
chiefest of the Inhabitants there, and after particular examinations of them,
executed them; the first that received his death was the chief Priest of
Pullaroon, a man that I have often seen, and took more notice of him then of
any other of the Bandaneeses that ever happened into my knowledge, he was a man
of a very civil deportment, delighting to be courteous both in his speech and
carriage; and as for his person he excelled all the Bandaneeses that ever I
observed for properness; this man they commanded should be laid down, and then
should have a hole cut in his side, into which hole they commanded Gunpowder
should be put, so setting fire to it, deprived the poor Priest (in a most
miserable manner) of his life, had Nero lived in those times, he might well
have blushed to see how much he was outvied by the Dutch, in Tyranny; I do
verily believe that the like was never heard before; and although these
Pullarooneers were under our protection, yet we dared not (in respect of our
strength) to contradict them, but permit tem to murder these poor people
before our faces, so that we perceiving how prevalent, Tyrannical, and
incr^aching the Dutch were, in the Year 1622. left the Banda Islands, which the
Dutch ever since possess, and most unjustly and wrongfully enjoy; one thing
very remarkable, that I cannot but relate, which is;

In those Islands I have constautly seen an innumerable company of Mackerell,
which was the chief thing that supported those Islands, and if it happened that
they came not in great showles, in two or three days we were sure to have them
in greater abundance when they did come; for indeed the Island could not
subsist without them; but that which strikes the greatest admiration into my
heart, is, That these great Showles of Mackerell (after the English had left
the Island) deserted it; which thing I look upon as the Justice of God Almighty
upon the Hollander, who were so cruel and tyrannical over those Inhabitants,
and also the English; and now having murdered the chief of the People, and
apprehending the wholsomnesse of those Islands (which indeed were the
wholsomest that ever I came into in all my travells) they by unjust means
detain and keep them, not permitting the English (which have the propper right
to it) to have any Commerce with them, which is very much to our dettriment;
And truly, if the COMMONWEALTH of England, are pleased to let them enjoy that
which is only theirs by usurpation, and ours by the free gift of the
Inhabitants, I must upon necessity rest satisfied, but the knowledge that I
have of those parts, and in the injustice of the Hollanders exacting them from
us, must give me cause to think, that we rather encourage them to act the like
thing again, then desire them from it; but I leave it all to the grave
judgment and Counsel of our Nation, whose discretions (the business being
weighed in the Balance of Reason) will induce them to desire, I hope, a
proportionable satisfaction, and that the truth may be more fully and expressly
known, I shall forthwith insert, not only the Accounts of my own losses, but
the Accounts of others now living, to justify what I have related; but before
I proceed, I will return to Sir Thomas Daile, who I left in Iackatray Road,
when I went with Captain Iackson for the Banda Islands, my desires are to
declare him according to the worth, Valor, and Nobleness, which was inherent
to him, therefore I crave the patience of the Reader.

THE THIRD PART OF THE Dutch Tyrannyes.
THis Sir Thomas Dail was a man endued with qualities which bespoke him truly
Noble, virtuous, and valiant, He was generally beloved amongst the Seamen, his
proportion and Strength we have often admired; I my self have seen him, and
President Iourden in the Great James together, President Iourden being as
remarkable for his shortness and valor, as Sir Thomas Daile was for his
stature and courage, these two I have seen walking upon the Decks, sporting
away the time with much friendship and love, but at last a difference arose
about the (...) of their Commissions, which caused much distraction in the
Fleet, upon which Sir Thomas Daile (after he had beaten the Dutch away to the
Eastward) sailed out of the Straits of Sunday for the Coast of Cormodell to the
Port of Meslapotan; After this, President Iourden commanded the Little James, a
Vessel of about 400 Tons to go for England, and President Ball that was
President before Iourden, came to Bantam, and was Ordered to go in her for
England; but whether he came home that year, I cannot exactly remember, and
then Captain Iourden took upon him the command of Sir Thomas Dailes Fleet,
which as I told you before, was the ground of their difference.

The aforenamed Sir Thomas Daile advanced his fortunes in France; for being
there Resident when a Spaniard came into France, and desired to venture his life
with the skilfullest Mounsieur there, upon which occasion Sir Thomas Daile
addressed himself to some of the Nobillity, and importuned them to crave leave
of the King that he might be permitted to encounter with the Spaniard, which
thing the King having well resented, gave consent, and a day was forthwith
appointed; the time being come, the Heroic Spaniard, in the field, was
forthwith entertained with much gallantry by Sir Thomas Daile, who maintained
the fight with as much Courage and Valor as could be expected, and after a hot
encounter, the Spanniard being much wounded began to want the life of Strength,
and immediately after wanted the strength of life, and so yielded the conquest,
and dyed.

The report of this honorable atchievment being bruted abroad, brought such a
general applause to the renowned Victor, that both the hearts and eyes of the
people were so much fixed upon him, that every one made it their study how to
respect him according to his deserts; the King also gratifying him, recommended
him to his Master the King of England; giving a sufficient Narrative of his
worth and valor, which brought him into high esteem in our English Nation; so
receiving a Knighthood, was afterward entrusted by Sir Thomas Smith, then
chief in England for the Virginia Company, who employed and entrusted him to go
chief Governor for Virginia, at which time I Abraham Wo^fe was shipped in the
Ship called the Clove bound for the sam^, place, whereof Captain Nuport was
chief; and after the well and true performance of the service, in which, to my
best remembran^, he was seven years he, was entrusted with 6. (...) to the
East Indies, the nam^ of (...) (...) the Sun, the Moon, the Globe, the Clove,
the Samson, and the Pepper-corn, with which Ships he came safe to the Cape, and
from thence set well forth, and so sailed within 30. leagues short of the
Straits of Sunday, but in the dark of the night, the Ship aforenamed the Sun,
which was the Ambrall, and the biggest in the Fleet, being headmost, fell foul
of the shoules of the Islands of Angania, and could not get off, but was there
lost, some of her men being cast ashore on that Island, were most cruelly
murdered by the Inhabitants thereof; but those that were well in health,
endeavored to get a way, to which purpose they got one of the ships Boats, and
the weather being very temperate and calm, they put to Sea, and came to Bantam,
where being arrived, they forthwith repaired to the President, and related to
him how many of the English were murdered and most barbarously used by the
Inhabitants of Angania, and that they conceived (if the President thought it
convenient) to send away a Vessel to that Island, many of the men which lay
there then sick, might be preserved from the hands of the cruel Islanders, and
that much of the Ships goods which was cast away might be recovered: The
President hearing this, forthwith commanded a Ship to be prepar^d and sent
spe^dily away for the Island of Angania, which being done, they set Sail, and
in a short time came to the Island, where being come, they perceived how most
unhumanely the Inhabitants had dealt with the English, they fell upon them, and
being very much enraged, put many of them to death, and afterward we returned,
and gave the President an Account of what they had done, who was something
incensed at the killing of so many of the Inhabitants, although they had been
so barbarous to our men.

Now Sir Thomas Daile having by this time come (with much difficulty) within
the Straits Mouth of Sunday, and having dropped. Anchor, forthwith Manned out a
Boat, and sent up to Bantam to desire men to help them to furle their Sails,
and weigh their Anchors, whereof I the Testator was one that was commanded out
to their assistance, they of themselves being so extreme, and unbelievably
weak, that they could not perform any service convenient for that time; but we
coming, weighed their Anchors, and did other things requisite, and brought
their Ships safely to Bantam, in the memorable year of the Blazing-Starre
before the death of Queen Anne, but during the time of Sir Thomas his abode
with us, his men having received the benefit and refreshment of the place, were
most of them again restored to their former healths, they having sucked, and
rubbed their aggrieved parts with Limes and Lemons, which is the best cure for
the Scurvey that can be thought of, for it cures (to my knowledge) the
soreness of the mouth, fastens the teeth, and asswages the swelling of the
flesh, and fastens it again to the bones.

Suddenly after the well recovery of Sir Thomas Daile and his men, Sir Thomas
being a man of an active spirit, and hating dronish Idleness, betook himself
again to Sea, and sailed to a Port called Meslapotaine, where being come, he
was arrested by Death at the Suit of Nature, and gave an Acquittance to the
World, and dyed; at which place a Monument was erected, which I believe is to
be seen to this day, in memory of so worthy and valiant a Knight, whose death
was sadly deplored by all the Seamen, for their hearts were so much united to
him, that their griefs for his loss swelled into great extremes: Thus leaving
Sir Thomas in his Tomb, I will return to Captain Iourden, and give the Reader a
short, yet true, Relation of what befell him by the Treachery of the perfidious
Dutch.

This Captain Iourden being a man more valiant, then prudent, sailing from
Bantam (upon a design, not known, nor to this day can be imagined) with two
Ships, the one called the Sampson, and the other the Hound, to the great
Islands of Burnew, and Anchored in a Port called Suckedany, and after a short,
stay there he discovered 3. or 4. Dutch Ships standing in for the same Port,
the sight whereof made him confident that they intended no good to him,
therefore he immediately gave order to prepare, and hasted aboard, fully
resolving to fight it out to the last man, rather then to yield himself, Ships,
and men, to the unmerciful hands of his approaching enemies, in the mean time
the Dutch approaching nearer and nearer, at last summoned our Ships to deliver
upon fair Quarter, but Captain Iourden having like the Be, Ingens spiculum, in
angusto corpore, a great heart in a little body, absolutely refused to yield
upon any conditions whatsoever; but the Dutch, being unwilling (as they
pretended) to shed blood, called out to our men, and told them, that they knew
little Captain Iourden was there, and withal desired them to persuade their
Captain to parley with them, that so they might forthwith prevent those dangers
that might accrue by the denial of so civil a courtesy; Captain Iourden
being informed of their desires (being much in fury) again refused, which
still made the Dutch more importunate to effect their own ends, to which
purpose, they again desired him that he would but show himself upon the
Quarter Deck, and speak with them, that so by a fair compliance they might
salve up the difference, and stop the effusion of blood, which must needs
happen, if not timely prevented, at last Captain Iourden (his passion being
something abated) thought that the speaking with them could not damnifie him,
therefore went to the Quarter Deck, and shewhimself to them, and after some
words exchanged between them, Captain Iourden told them, That he knew the
justness of his Cause, and the injustice of theirs, and was resolved to fight
it out with them to the last man, the Hollander urging, That alas their
strength was far greater then his, and it would be ^steemed rather
desperateness then true Valor to fight upon such odds; and moreover, that he
would make himself guilty ^f the blood of those men that should be slain in
the fight;

All these words, and vain persuasions of the Dutch could no way alter the
Resolution of Captain Iourden, he telling them, that he questioned not his
strength, but was resolved to fight, and to leave the Success to God;
Notwithstanding this; the Dutch, willing to bring their treacherous design to
pass, protracted as much time as they could, still keeping him in talk upon
the Quarter Deck, till at length, a musket shot from one of the other ships
killed Captain Iourden in the place while they were in Parley, and at that very
instant of time, whether by treachery, or accedent, I know not, our ship called
the Hound, was part of it blown up, and many of our men mortally hurt, which
sudden business, caused such an amazement amongst our men, that they knew not
for the present what to imagine; First, they saw their Captain treacherously
slain; Secondly, They saw part of the Hound blown up; and thirdly, they saw
that the Dutch on a sudden were preparing to come aboard, and being in this sad
condition, they were enforced to yield to the mercy of their Enemies, who
having made them their captives, caused them (according to their former use) to
be put into Bolts, not allowing us so much favor as they did to the Heathen,
for they permitted them after they had taken them, to walk too and fro with a
chain, which is far more easy, then to lie in heavy Bolts of Iron; This is the
favor we English have received from them, that we must either be troubled with
a guard of Iron hearted men to attend us, or else lie in Bolts of Iron, or in
the Stocks; but I must omit to inform the Reader how the Ship called the
Hound was conceived to be blown up.

During the time that Captain Iourden was in parley with the Hollander, our
Boats, and theirs had free recourse to either of our Ships, at which time we
had aboard the Hound, a Portugal, who was in the Hollanders Ships several
times, and was known to some of them; we therefore supposed, that during the
time of this Portugals stay with them, they inveagled him to set fire to some
of our Cartrages which we had laid ready for the fight; but that which most of
all confirms our belief, is this, that this Portugal was seen several times
by these Cartrages with a Match in his hand, and it is verily thought, that he
was hired to do it, in respect that it happened so immediately after the death of
Captain Iourden.

Thus we may observe what injury and wrong we have sustained by the Dutch, who
have been often desired to make satisfaction, and many of us that have been
wronged and abused by them, did from time to time Petition the Lords and many
other of the Kings Privy Council, but found no redress, but our hopes are, that
when our Honorable Council of State shall hear the sad cries of the poor for
Justice against that Nation of blood (the Hollander) who is not to be
satisfied; for they will have the kernells, let who will take the shells.

Our Ship called the Charles, being about 1000. Tun in burden came home, we
forthwith repairing to the East-Indie House, and informed the Company of our
sufferings and losses, who told us they would do what might be done for us; not
long after we were served with Subpoena's to attend the Lords of the Privy
Council, where we only heard the noise of satisfaction, but I for my part
could never find the comfort of it; At that same time I Abraham Woof being
examined, told the Privy Council, that the Dutch had taken and possessed the
Islands of Banda, which are of such concernment, as I then related, that the
Dutch could never give the English satisfaction, how the business was smothered
up, I know not; but I am sure if any was done, I will venture my life it was not
to the value of a pin to a pound, and moreover I will make it appear, that they
got those Islands only by bloodshed, and murdering both the English and
their friends, and possesses them by treachery and usurpation to this day, and
the people (if they have left any of them alive) are but slaves to the Dutch;
and for the better satisfaction of all, I will here insert the Petition of one
David Powell to the Lords of the Privy Council, and the Account both of his, my
own, and others now living, all of us being aged not under 60, and if the
Honorable Counsel of STATE shall think it convenient for us to set out Bills
to summon in those that have been Sufferers, either them, their sons, or
Grandchildren, I am confident we shall discover some hundreds which have been
highly wronged by the Dutch; and I am very sure, that many fatherless children
may be relieved out of the Profits, and satisfaction they ought to make us; but
I shall leave all to the Grave, and serious Judgments of the COUNSEL of this
Nation, and the World to judge.

To the Right Honorable the Lords and others of the King Majesty's most
Honorable Privy Council.
The Humble Petition of David Powell.
Most humbly showing,
THat whereas Roger Powel his brother about 9. years since betook himself to
travel into the East Indies, and returned about three years after with some
convenient fruit of his Voyage, and about one year after that (being still a
single man) having a stock of near about 100. l. betook himself to a second
Voyago with such entertainment and acceptance of the Adventurers, through his
former expense and honest behavior, that he was in good place, and gathered an
estate to the value of better then 300. l. sterling in Account in those parts,
and being slain (among diverse others) in a Ship called the Hound, taken by
certain Hollanders at Mes^potain, wherein was the Petitioners said whole Estate
lost, with his own life: Of all which the Company of Merchants have been
credibly certified; And your Lordships poor Petitioner has hand-writings, and
(if occasion requires) can have the persons of diverse eyewitnesses ready to
prove the truth thereof upon their Oaths, and, being sole Brother to the said
Roger Powel, and by Letters of Administration lawfully entitled to such Estate
as he left behind him,

Most humbly beseeches your Honors relief at the hands of the Company, as it
does or shall please your good Honors to vouchsafe to others in the like case.

And your Honors poor Petitioner (according to his bounden duty) shall pray
for your, etc.

Henry Cooley did entrust Captain Lane of the Solomon with 600. Rialls of 8. at
his say ling for the Isles of Banda, which ship was unh ap pily taken by the
Dutch.

Also he did in trust one Nicholas Gates which was in the Thomas, with Serasse,
Pantadoes, White and Blue Baff^es, to the value of 600. Rs. of 8. likewise in
Money 150. Rs. of 8. which Goods being at Lantore, the Dutch taking that Town
by an assault, was lost by the said ^cholas Gates, and the said Henry Cooley
never received any consideration for those Goods, as to my knowledge to this
day, by reason of the Dutch seizing of all; the party being now alive, aged
above threescore years, and to my knowledge at this time is glad to receive
alms of h^lf a Crown a week, or otherwise he might perish, but for some good
that charitable people bestow upon him Alms.

This Henry Cooley now living can witness the Bandaneeses did come from the
I Will of (...) to Bantam, and besought President Ball, that our King of England
would please to be their Protector, and to keep them from the disturbance of
all other Nations, and to that end they brought a great brass Basin filled with
Earth, and a small growing branch with fruit on it, as a Pledge of their
Resignall; Nevertheless the Hollander took their Lands and Goods from them, all
that were in any wise friends to the English, and have kept them to their own
use for these 31. years, that if they should give for them and Moleuco Islands
100000. l. per annum, to this Commonwealth, it were too little in my opinion.

David Powell, the brother of Roger Powell abovesaid, deceased, has been at
charges to take out Letters of Administration, and afeer that petitioned our
Privy Council, that the Dutch might make them satisfaction, but to to this
very day he never received any, the man being now sixty years of age, and very
much indebted, desires he might be considered among the rest if they make
satisfaction. This David Powell dwells in Chiswell street, and is a very
honest man, and willing to pay what he is indebted, if he were in any ways
able.
