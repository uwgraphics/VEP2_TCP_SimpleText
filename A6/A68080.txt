The interpretacyon / and sygnyfycacyon of the Mass. Here begins a good
devout Book to the honor of god / of our lady his mother / and of all
saints / and right profitable to all good Catholyke persons / to know how
they shall devoutly here Mass. And how salutaryly they shall Confess them. And
how reverently and honorably they shall go to the holy Sacrament or table of
our savior Ihesu christ / with diverse other profitable documentes and
oraysons or prayers here contained / Composed and ordained by friar Gararde /
friar mynoure / of the order of the Obseruauntes.

The Prologue.
IS the scripture does teache us / and saint Gregorye does write / among al
sacryfyces and oblacyons / there is no service so acceptable unto god / as
dyleccyon and love of the health of the soul / as well of him self as of other
men the which pryncypally is serched and gotten by the passion of our lord
Ihesu christ sone of god: in the remembrance whereof / the most honorable
sacryfyce of the mass is done and celebrate / as by the holy sacrament.
Wherefore the auctoure of this book willing to induce the people to here mass
devoutly / and to ordeyne some thing that a man may read or think in the
mass time which is a work that does surmou^t and pass all the understanding
under god both in heaven and earth / has written i^ this book as much as the
holy ghost does show us and devout doctors do write / and as belongs to
man to know of the same: the which book is dyuyded in three parts as does
appear / every of them in his place. Therefore he yt with great merytes will
here mass / he shall read the orayson and prayer which is put at every
article. Or if he can not read: he shall devoutly premedyte and think of the
life of our lord: and shall say at every article a Pater noster and an Aue.
And than he shall have said as many times the Pater noster / as our lord has
lived years upon the earth / in the gratytude and kyndnes of al his great
trauayles and pains / in watchynge / fasting / prayenge prechenge / in his
passion / which he has suffered for us poor sinners. And trusting in the
mercy of god that the man so exercysynge him self toward god / shall never
be lost nor dampened. And if there were any sick or otherwise feeble of nature
or of necessytie should go by the countrees / or women in child bed / or in
other necessyties that they might not here mass / they shall exercise them
self in redynge this little book of the mass / in offrynge so to god a good
will / the which for that time shall be suffycyent / seeing that otherwise
they can not amend it.

Here ends the table of this present Book of the Mass.
Here begins the first book, containing very profitable Doctrynes,
serving to the Mass divided in.xxxiii. Chapytres.
The first Chapter: wherefore the Mass in all languages is called Missa / and
none otherwise.
IN all languages (as Laten / Hebreu / Greek / in English / French / and in
all other la^guages) the blyssed Sacryfyce of the Mass: is named and called a
Mass. And that is as the Doctors do witness for three causes.

First Missus in laten does sygnyfie and is as much to say as sent / for the
Catholyke people do send to the father of heaven by the hands of a Priest /
which is a medytatoure between the father of heaven and the sinner: a sacryfyce
and oblacyon prayenge to obtain by the same grace in the soul / and pardone
of all sins.

Secondaryly Missio is to say: an offering sent unto us from heaven / from the
father almighty / by the words of the consecracyon of the priest: in the
which consecracyon the sone of god descends in body / united with the
dyuynyte / the which the priest receives to the health of all catholyke people
/ as well living as deed: being in the state of grace.

Thyrdly Missio is also as much to say as sent without / For at the
beginning of the holy church / all those which were not baptized in
contynent after that the gospel was song of the deacon: they were sent out of
the church / the which be named Cate cumini / that is to say: people blyssed
of the priest / but not yet baptized / wherefore they were not worthy to behold
the holy sacrament in the Mass.

The second Chapter / wherefore commonly the catholyke churches be sytuate /
or set in the Eest and west parts and the mass is said in the Eest part.
ALl good and Catholyke people shall make their prayers to almighty god being
with their vysages toward the Eest part / where the Son does rise / rather
than toward the West / North / or Southe / for after the ordinance of the
holy church: the mass is rather said in the Eest part than in the West /
North / or Southe / and that is for four reasons.

First to the intent that we do not resemble and be like to the Jews /
Sarazyns / or Turks / or other Infydelles / for the Jews do pray / with
their faces toward the West / the Sarazyns in praynge do tour netheyr faces
toward the Southe / And the Turks and other Infydelles do make their prayers
toward the North. And therefore we do read contrary to them in the North
part (from whens all evil does come and shall come unto us) the holy gospel
of the Mass.

Secondaryly / we pray toward the Eest part / for there is Paradyse
terrestre sytuate / where by right our dwelling place is / and from whens we
be chased and put out for our misdeeds and sins. And to the intent that we
may return again in to our country / out of this valee of mysery and
sorrow / where we be but as banysshed / which can not enjoy our propre land
and country. Therefore we do turn us toward the same / prayenge and
desiring to come there again.

Thyrdly / for our Lord the sone of god / has honge upon the cross / with
his face and vysage toward the west part / and his back toward the Eest
part. Wherefore when we pray in the Eest part / we be sytuate with our
vysages before the cross / beholdynge in the face of our lord Ihesu christ /
to the intent that by his bitter and sharp passion we may be saved / we
turn us toward his face / as desiring the same / otherwise we should be
turned toward him with our back and to the contrary.

Fourthly / for when our lord did ascend in to heaven / he was sytuate in the
Eest part / where his apostelles did worship him / and where he shall be
constytute at the day of judgment. And this does sygnyfye unto us that after
we be deed / we be buried with the head toward the west part / and the fete
in the Eest part / for at the day of judgment wha^ we shall be resuscytate
from death / we shall rise as we do lie / and shall go straight forth without
retournynge / to the judgment of god syttyng in the Eest part.

The third Chapter / who did say the first Mass upon the earth / and who
has so ordained and composed it sens that time.
AS the holy scripture does teache us / our lord the sone of god in his last
supper that he made with his apostelles in his life / did instytute the holy
sacrament: and he only did speak the words of the consecracyon as a very
priest / after the order of Melchysedech: In the which supper our lord as a
soueraygne bishop / did ordeyne all his apostelles priests / co^maundynge
them and also all other priests that shall come after them / so to do in his
remembrance and co^memoracyon.

After this the apostelles said the Mass: spekyng the same words yt our lord
did in blyssynge the bread / with a Pater noster: and so the mass was said
and accomplysshed. And in this manner saint Peter did the first mass / by the
space of four years in the Eest part / where he was bishop / and after was
constytute bishop in Antyoche And there he said after the Pater noster / three
oraysons.

Saint James the less said the first mass at Jerusalem before that he was
bishop. Saint Marce the euangelyste said the first mass in Alexandrye / and
so all the other apostels in all quarters of the world. After them / the holy
catholyke church has ordained and instytute / to say the epistle and the
holy gospel. And finally diverse holy popes and bysshopes / by inspyracyon of
the holy ghost / as saint Gregorye / saint Basilius / saint Celestyn: saint
Ambrose / and saint Austyn / have ordained and instytute it as it is now and
ever shall be.

The fourth Chapter / if the first mass of a new priest be better than the
second or the third of another priest.
THe holy sacrament consecrate of the priest / is in all masses and of all
priests of like power and might / as touching the holy sacrament. Yet
notwithsta^dynge the first mass is commonly more profitable and merytoryous:
than the second or the third: and yt is for four reasons. The first cause is
/ for in the first mass there be many reuerences and solempnytes done / which
be not done in other times / as to com to offer: to hang the church with
Tapysserye / to cast and sprede herbs in every place and other ceremonies /
the which be done by devotion: and to move the hertes of catholyke people to
fervent prayers and oraysons. The second cause is / for i^ the first mass the
sins be more habundau^tly pardoned for certain pardons and indulgences given
them / which do here the first mass. The third cause is: for in the first
mass the priests be wont to prepare them self more devoutly: than at another
time. And therefore their prayers be than more acceptable / devout / and
fervent to pray for them that do here their first masses for to obtain grace.
The fourth cause is: for in the first mass certain souls be delivered from
purgatory / the which god has ordained to be delivered at that time / and
not in none other masses: as it is red of saint Gregorye / that in his first
mass / he delyueryd as many souls as there was folks heryng his mass and of
such examples there be many.

The fyfth Chapter / if it be more for the soul health / to here mass of a
devout and virtuous priest / than of an evil priest.
Upon this devout doctors do say / that we may speak of the mass in three
manners.

First touching the holy sacrament of the blyssed body of our lord Ihesu
christ / the which is the most pryncypall in the mass. The mass is as good
of an evil priest as of a good / for the holy sacrament is not worse nor the
virtue thereof dymynysshed by the evil priest / nor better and of greatter
virtue by reason of the good priest. Yet nevertheless the evil priest being in
sin does receive it to his dampnacyon.

Secondaryly / a man may consydre / by what person the mass is done and said
/ for if it be said by the person / or vycare / or chaplayne of the church /
for other persons and not for him self / than the mass is as good of an
evil priest / as of a good and a virtuous priest.

Thyrdly a man may speak of the mass touching the prayers and oraysons / the
which the priest says in the mass time / And than the mass said of a good
and devout priest is more better / than of a sinner and an evil priest.

The syxte chapter / If all the masses be like good: as mass of Requiem / of
our Lady / of the holy Sacrament. etc. and which is best.
OF the office or service of the mass we may speak in two manners / as the
Canon law does show us.

First there be certain festes / which has their propre office and service
/ as Ester / Pentecoste / the Ascencyon / the Dedycacyon: All the festes of our
lady: and commonly the Sondayes / and diverse other days. In these high and
great feestes it is not co^uenyent (but of necessyte) that a man shall say any
other mass / and leave the mass of the great feast. Therefore we shall not
cause to say any other mass / but the same of the day and feast.

Secondaryly / there be certain days in the weke / which has no propre
office: and than it is best to say the mass / wherein the priest or the man
has the greatest devotion as of Requiem / or of the Vysytacyon / Annuncyacyon:
Assumpcyon. etc. And so there be certain masses ordained by certain devout
persons / or by apparycyon / the which be very good and profitable to be said
as well for these that be living / as those that be deed. As the pope Boniface
has ordained five masses / in the honor of the five wounds of our lord /
the which be very devout and profitable. And also there is found in writing
for a truth / that there be.vii. masses called the golden masses the which
said of a devout priest the space of.vii. days / every day in remembrance as
hereafter is written / be very profitable / for to deliver shortly the poor
souls out of purgatory / the which acordynge to the justice of god / ought
to be a long season in the pains of purgatory / for it is red of a devout
priest / which in one mass delivered a hondreth souls / which were seen of
another devout man / flyeng out of purgatory as thycke as sparks of fire.

The.vii. Chapter / how a man shall say the seven masses.
First: the first mass shall be said on the Mondaye in the honor and
gratytude / that our lord Ihesu christ was taken in the gardayne / prayenge
that he will deliver the poor and miserable souls out of the prison of
purgatory. Secondaryly / the Tuesdaye the mass shall be said in the honor /
that our lord pyteously and cruelly was bound to the pyller / prayenge him
that he will unbind the souls out of the bands of debt and pains.

Thyrdly / the wednesdaye mass shall be said in the honor of the unjust
judgment and sentence that Pylate gave of our lord the innocent lamb /
prayenge that he will deliver the soul from the just sentence that shall be
given upon the souls.

Fourthly / the Thursday in the honor of the incomparable pains that god
suffered hangyng on the cross and nailed with great nails of iron / prayenge
that he will deliver the soul lyenge bound in purgatory. Fyftly / the
Frydaye the mass shall be said in the honor of all the wounds that our lord
had in his blyssed body / which were.v.M.iiii.C.lxv. prayenge our lord that
he will deliver the soul from the wou^des of conscience / wherewith it is
maculate and spotted.

Syxtly / the Saterdaye in the honor that our lord was taken down from the
cross and buried: which nevertheless was king of heaven / prayenge that he will
deliver the soul out of the sepulcher of purgatory. Seventhly / the.vii.
mass shall be said in the honor that god did rise gloryously from death
the.iii. day / prayeng hertely that by the same resurreccyon / he will grant
the soul to rise from the pain of purgatory / so that it may raygne with
him / and to five euerlastyngly.

The.viii. Chapter: If every catholyke person be bound to here mass the
Sunday.
EVery good catholyke person which is come to lawful age / is bound and
commanded by the law / to here a hole mass on the Sunday / and that he do
not depart out of the church / unto the last benedyccyon be given of the
priest / except that he have so great and lawful necessyte / that he can not
here mass. The necessyties be declared by devout doctors in diverse manners.

First syckenes of the body / so that with out peril he can not go out of his
house.

Secondaryly / those which have many young or sick children / the which in
the mean time: they can not leave alone nor with none other person / nor they can
not bring them with them: for fere that they do not come in to a worse case
thereby.

Thyrdly / in such wise that in some country is the custom when the next
friends is deed / they abide a certain time in the house without coming
forth. Yet always by license they may have mass said in their house. And so
it is to understand that may dens that marye / where it is so acustomed.
Fourthly / when a town or a castle is beseyged and in peril and danger of
enemies. And if certain persons be not there present / the said town or
castle should be in danger to be taken / or might have some other evil
chance.

Fyftly / all that which acordyng to good conscience / is a just and a lawful
cause / does excuse man before god and holy church / of not herynge mass /
yet nevertheless such a person shall do some other good deed that day or
some other day for it / wherefore when the man can not go to the church / he
shall read in this little book.

The.ix. Chapter: if it be commanded to here Mass: as well of all other
feestes and holidays / as of the Sondayes.
WE have it written in the law Canon / that where there is like and egall reason
/ there is also like and egall law. The reason wherefore it is commanded to
here mass the Sondayes: is because the man than should occupye him self with
god / which thing can not be better done than by herynge of mass / and
should not occupye him self with other bodily work / the which also for the
same reason is defended and forbyde in other feestes and holy days. Yet
nevertheless as the doctors do witness and write: there be some little feestes
ordained by the bishop / wherein (after the mass is herd) a man may work a
little for another / but not for him self. And this he may do by four manners
without sin. First / when it is a little work so that by the same he does
not overcome his heart with labor / and be not evil dysposed in his body
thereby.

Secondaryly / when it is great necessyte and that the busynes can not be
dyfferred to another day / for the peril and danger that may come thereof: As
when the corn is in the feldes: and that it is like to be great rayn and other
tempests / or for fere of enemies i^ the time of war. Than a man may gather
together his corn and bring it in to the barn without sin. Also bochers /
bakers and other vytellers may sell their vytaylles / without the which the
people can not pass or abide unto the next day following. Thyrdely / when it
is for the common profit of any town or vyllage / as to make common ways /
brygges / or churches / or such other.

Fourthly / when such a work is done for the love of god / as for poor
folks / which can not help them self / that is to say to serve them / to
labor for them / to carry wode or any other manner of thing for the love of
god / this may a man do without sin: yet nevertheless he must always
here mass.

The.x. Chapter / If a man may go on pilgrimage the Sondayes and other
feestes. And if servants be bound to here mass the Sondayes.
Saint Hierome says / that that thing which man does is not acceptable to
god wha^ he leueth that thing undone which he is bound to do: to go in
pilgrimage the Sunday / except that it be great need / and cheyfly before that
a man here mass / can not be done without sin. Tha^ much more do they sin
which do go for their marchau^dyse on the sunday without herynge mass / and
without necessyte. If the master command his servant to ride or go / or to
work on the sunday / and if necessyte require it / than the master nor the
servant do not offend / but if it were not for necessyte: tha^ the master
does offend. If the servant do it with out commandment and that he might
here mass if he would in rysynge a little erlyer in the morning / than the
master is excused / and the servant only shall make aco^pte thereof before god.

The.xi. Chapter: If it be suffycye^t that a man here one mass the Sunday /
in leuynge the sermon and euensonge the same day.
AFter the commandment of god: man is bound to keep and sanctyfye the holy
day by good works: not only by one good work as to here mass / but rather
by many good works / for as Doctors do say / that man which will
acco^plysshe the third commandment of god / as to sanctyfye the sunday: he
shall do that same day after his power / six things.

First he shall here mass as is aforesaid. Seco^daryly: he shall also here the
sermon if it be possible / for if the man did leave or lease it by contempt or
custom / he should syn^e greatly. And if he can not here the sermon / he shall
read in the stead of the sermon some other good thing.

Thyrdly / the man also shall give that same day an almous for the love of god
/ if he be of power. And in case that he be not of substance to give almous it
is suffycyent / if he have a good will so to do.

Fourthly / the man shall pray that same day for his greatest health.

Fyfthly / he shall remember that day the goodness and benefytes that he has
received of god / princypally that god has creat him of nothing / and has
called him unto the holy catholyke faith: And delivered him by his precious
blood / and this doing the man shall love god with all his heart. Syxtly / the
man is also bound the same day / to make a general confession of all his
mortal sins / the which he has done sens his last confession / and thereof
to have contrycion and repentance between god and his conscience. For this
commandment of god / to sanctyfye the Sunday / no man may accomplysshe
being in the state of deedly sin. Yet nevertheless the man is not bound to
confess him but at the time ordained and instytute by the church but in
certain causes hereafter in the fyfth Chapter of this book written. Yet he is
bound that same day to make a general confession and to have contrycyon /
and to purpose never after to sin.

The.xii. Chapter / how the man shall behave him self in the mass time /
after the ordinance of the holy church and the law Canon.
WE find written in Canon law in diverse places / that our mother the holy
church has ordained nine ordinances or manners of the mass / the which all
christen people ought to keep. First / the man albeit that he have herd one
mass / yet he shall here the high mass / if it be not that he be lawfully
excused for certain necessyties / as is aforesaid.

Seco^daryly / the man shall also here mass in his parysshe church / and he
shall not go by contempt to any other.

Thyrdly / those that will devoutly here mass / they shall leave their hawks
and their dogs at the church door / or else at home in their howses.

Fourthly / the lay people shall not sytte or stand by the high altar /
pryncypally whiles that the mass is said. And above all the women shall absent
them from the altar.

Fyfthly / the man shall keep scylence / and shall make no trouble nor noise i^
the mass time / but shall pray with a fervent heart. Syxtly / every man when
he heryth the gospel red: shall stand vpryght ready with his body to defend
the holy catholyke faith / which god has spoken in the holy gospel.
Seventhly / every person herynge the name of Ihesus: shall knele or bow with
his knees / or he shall inclyne with his heed in sign and token of reverence /
for so often as the person does it / he does merit threscore days of pardon /
given by two popes.

Eyghtly / all good catholyke people shall knele down of both their knees: when
the priest does lift our lord Ihesu in the mass and shall worship the holy
sacrament with great reverence.

The.ix. every good christen man and woman shall offer some thing at the mass
/ for god spekyng in the old testament says Ye shall not come in my presence
void or Idle / that is to say / that at the least ye shall offer unto god a
fervent prayer and orayson. And there where it is the custom / the man shall
give i^ the mass time temporal goods and offrynges. But to this no man is
bound except in great and high feestes: after the custom of the country or
place.

The.xiii. Chapter / If the man be bound to here mass of his Curate / and in
his own parysshe.
IT is written i^ the Canon law / that he which contempneth his own curate
and church / and goth to here mass i^ another place: shall be chased out of
that church where he goth unto. This commandment has our mother holy
church given / for to co^strayne them that do rebel against their curates /
in contempnynge them and also their mother the holy church / and to bring
them to subieccyon and humylytye. Yet nevertheless if any man do go to here
dyuyne service in any other church / without any contempt / but rather that
he has greater devotion there or better place / or yt he does here the sermon
there and other seruyces / which he can not here in his parysshe church or
for any other just cause / he does not offend / in case that his bishop or
curate have not forbid him the same.

The.xiiii. Chapter / If mass may be said in places not hallowed / as within
the house.
WE have it written i^ the Canon law / that in as much as is possible / a man
shall not say mass without places dedycate and hallowed / and pryncypally in
the ships being upon the sea / for the danger that may come thereof. It is
better to be said in the feldes upon a stone hallowed or dedycate and set in a
case of wood with two fair to wells spread upon the same / or one to well
doubled. etc. There can no mass be said in a house or a chamber / without
lyce^ce of the bishop: but the freers which be called freers prechers / and
myneurs have pryuylege and license to say mass in the house / in time of
necessytye / how be it they may not mynyste the sacrament to no person under
the pain of excomynycacyon / without license of the Curate.

The.xv. Chapter / if a man the sunday in the mass time may say that thing
/ which is command him in penance.
SOme doctors do say / that the so^dayes wha^ a man hereth but one mass that
he ought not to say or read any thing joined to him in penance The reason is
/ for with one penny a man can not pay two credytours or dettours / and so also
a man can not at one time accomplysshe two commandments / for ye be bound
to here mass and to say your iniu^ccyon. Against this there be certain other
doctors which do say / that there is none appare^ce nor reason therein / for
man may observe and keep all the commandments of god at one time / wherefore
a man may at one time here mass and also say his iniu^ccyon: for otherwise
among an hondreth persons / there should not one here mass well / nor should
not also say well his iniu^ccyon / which be so simple yt they know none
otherwise to do. Wherefore he that knows how to do / he shall say his
iniu^ccyon either before or after the mass for the surety thereof. And that
said he shall commend it unto god / in remembrynge in the mass time the
passion of our lord / as hereafter is written.

The.xvi. Chapter / If the man which comes after that the mass is begone /
be yet bound on the sondayes / to here another mass.
Because that all the works of god be parfyte / So he will also that ours in
likewise be parfyte and not dyuyded nor broken / for an hondreth peaces do not
make one hole peace. It is commanded in the spyrytuall law / that every man
shall here one hole mass to the end on the sondayes and holidays. He that
heryth than but a peace of the mass does not accomplysshe the commandment of
the holy church. But he that comes a little to late / after co^fiteor / or
kyryeleyson / or there aboutes and no further / he is not bound to here
another mass. For a little is in manner as nothing pryncypally when it is not
done by co^tempte / if he com after that the half or the third part of the
mass be done / than he is bound to here another hole mass. Those that do
help and serve at the mass / which often times be let in the mass time /
re^nynge for insence / wine / or any other thing touching the mass / be
excused / and they be not bound to here another hole mass.

The.xvii. Chapter / if it be requysyte that the man here and understand the
words of the mass.
AFter Canon law / it is commanded to all christen people to here mass /
how be it the priest does sometime read so low: that those which be but a
little from him can not here nor understand the words of the mass. Wherefore
the doctors do say / that it is suffycyent if the man be present at the mass
whyther he here and understand the words or no. And whyther he be far of or
nere / so that he be present: and it is suffycyent if he do se the priest. But
if there be any that understand Latin / he may go nere to the altar when the
priest does read the holy gospel to here it. Therefore many simple folks do
evil / which do make noise and rumoure in rennynge here and there when the
priest does lift our lord / and do trouble both the priest and other persons
of their devotion. He that can not se our lord without re^nynge here and there
and troublynge other folks / he shall turn his face to the priest / in
casting his iyes deuoutely toward the ground thinking with the Publycane /
which being far of in the temple / did esteem him self that he was not
worthy / to lift up his iyes in to heaven: but knocking on his breast said. O
good lord have mercy of me poor sinner / for the sinner shall often times cast
his iyes toward the ground by humylyte / when the priest does lift our lord
in the mass / estemynge him self not to be worthy to behold the holy and
blyssed sacrament with his iyes.

The.xviii. Chapter / what profit comes by the mass / and what persons
may have and use it.
OF the mass do come honor: glory / and health: Honor to god / glory to the
aungelles / and saints / And health to the men and women.

First of the mass / the holy and blyssed trynyte receives glory / honor /
and praise / i^ the honor and glory whereof the mass is said and done and the
holy trynyte is there present. Secondaryly / the aungelles and all the saints
in heaven do rejoice of the mass / for they be glad of all thing that is done
in the earth to the honor and laud of god / and pryncypally when god is
honored by the^ and in them.

Thyrdly / of the mass does come profit and conforte to the souls lyenge in
purgatory. For there is no virtue nor prayer so profitable unto them: as the
mass done or said for them / for by the same / their deedly sins be forgyuen
and also venyall sins. And that is by the holy sacrament / which the priest
does offer in remembrance of the passion of our lord Ihesu christ.

Fourthly / the mass also gives conforte and socoure to the living persons
/ for by the same the man is often times delivered from many perils of the
body: as is declared in the.xxiii. Chapter in the last condycyon or degree: and
in the.xxiiii. Chapter following. Fyfthly / the man also i^ his life does get
and obtain pardon of many venyall sins which he does commit daily / whereof
he is contryte and sorry.

And this is in the mass time in seven manners.

First all those that do say Confiteor with the priest.

Secondaryly / he that does inclyne in bowynge his knees / and doing reverence
wha^ he hereth the sweet name of Ihesus.

Thyrdly / he that kneleth down to the ground / when the priest does read in
the Credo. Et homo factus est.

Fourthly / he that with great devotion / beholds the holy sacrament when the
pressed does lift it.

Fyfthly / he that with contrycyon and repentance of his sins / does knock
upon his breast when the priest says in the Pater noster / Et dimitte nobis
debita nostra / or the man may say the Pater noster with the priest / And
when he shall say / Et demitte nobis debita nostra / he may knock on his
breast.

Syxtly / he that does with humylyte receive the benedyccyon of the priest / at
the end of the mass.

Seventhly / he that after the mass does receive of the priest or by him
self / the holy water with repentance of his venyall sins. And according
to the quantyte or greatness of the devotion: the venyal sins be pardoned and
forgyuen to the man.

The.xix. Chapter / if a man may without sin say or cause a mass to be
said for money.
WE have it written in the holy scripture / that it is Symonye to sell that
thing / which is sanctyfyed and dedycate unto god. And that he which does
sell it / has received it of god for no thing: And so both he that does sell
it and that does bye it do commit deedly sin. For it is against al laws /
as against the law of god / the law of man / and the law of nature. Wherefore
when the intent of the priest is pryncypally upon money / and makes
marchaundyse of the mass: And that those which cause the mass to be said /
do take it that they do bye it for so much money / they do both committee
Symonye and is deedly syn^e. Therefore when a man will have a mass said for him
or for his fre^des / he shall say to the priest. Sir we may not make
marchaundyse of the mass / but I pray you say so many masses for me or for my
friends / and I will provide for you and recompense your pain. And than ye
shall provide him of an honest living according to his estate and degree. For
as the apostell saint Paul says / he that serves at the aultre / he must
live by the aultre / for the priest has none other occupacyon.

The.xx. Chapter / In what thing and whereby a man may consydre the greatness
and dygnyte of the mass.
THe dygnyte and holiness of the blyssed mass may be considered by five
reasons.

First: for in the mass is (...) the same blyssed flesh / that Mary the
mother of god did conceive and the precious blood shed upon the cross on good
frydaye. And therefore says Crysostome / that touching the holy sacrament of
the altar: the mass is not of less dygnyte and value / than the death of our
lord god upon the cross for the health of the man. For as the death of our lord
has delivered man from everlasting death / so is everlasting life given to
them / which be delivered by the mass.

Secondaryly / a man may consydre the dygnyte of the mass / for there is
always present all the holy company of heaven. That is to say / the holy
trynyte / Mary the mother of god / with all the holy au^gelles and saints:
beholdynge and worshyppynge the holy and blyssed sacrament. For as saint
Gregorye says / who is he that would doubt yt wha^ heaven does open / at the
time that the priest does consecrate the sacrament / and that the sone of god
as the king of glory / does descend upon the altar / that there does not
come a great multitude and company of holy aungelles with him. For a mighty
king or prince when he will show his mageste he does take with him / his
nobles / his knights and other his servants. Should tha^ the king of glory
descend him self alone and without company / I do not believe it. Thyrdly / ye
shall consydre that without light the priest may not say mass / when there
should be both Son / Moon / and sterres shynyng upon the altar. And that
does sygnyfye / that there shall be in us a hot and fervent love of god / and
a ferme and steadfast faith and believe. Also the orname^tes of the mass ought
to be dedycate and hallowed. And also the chalyce / the corporas / the altar
clothes and towelles / and other preparementes / ought also to be hallowed / or
else a man may not say mass. Also he that shall say the mass / ought to be
a priest consecrate: and otherwise he may not / were he as holy as our lady
the mother of god. For all the saints and au^gelles in heaven can not say nor
do one mass.

Fourthly / ye shall consydre that all that is done and said in the mass: has
a synguler mystery and devotion in it / so that the priest does not say one
word / nor does not move ones his hand i^ the mass: but it does sygnyfye
some thing of the life of our lord. For as Aureolus says in Co^pe^dio
theology / in the syxt book in the.xviii. Chapter / that the mass (in a
manner of speaking) is as full of dyuyne mysteryes / as the sea of drops of
water / and the son full of light and the sky full of sterres. And also all
christen people being here in earth and in purgatory / and all the saints in
heaven / have a synguler joy and gladness of the mass. And some doctors do
say / that there is never a mass said here i^ earth / but there is one soul
delivered out of purgatory / or a sinner converted / or a good and just man
preserved and kept from falling in to temptacyon.

Fyfthly / ye may also consydre the high dygnyte of the mass / for it is
aorned with many diverse languages and praises. First Hebreu / as Amen /
alleluya / sabbath / osanna: also Greek / as kyry eleyson / christ eleyson /
also Laten / as dominus vobiscu^ / pax tecum. Also ye here the voice of our
lord in the gospel: the which every person ought to here with great devotion
/ not sitting nor knelynge / but standing vpryght / ready to fight unto death
for to defend it and the holy faith. And as ye do here god speak in the
gospel / so ye here also the voice of aungelles / as in Gloria in excelsis
deo. Also the voice of the apostelles / as in the epystelles. Also the voice of
the sinner / in the Co^fiteor. Also ye here the voice of the just man / as in
the graduall or grayle / alleluya offetorye and co^munyon or common. And
therefore every good christen person shall dyspose him self devoutly to here
mass / with a fervent heart and with great reverence / as if he were upon the
mount of Caluerye / and there did se our lord god hanging upon the cross. O
with what and how great devotion should we be at the mass / and should
remember the blyssed passion of our lord god: the which is represented and
showed in the mass.

The.xxi. Chapter / what the person shall read in the morning when he does
rise from bed.
O Lord god Ihesu christ / I thank the most humbly yt thou haste preserved
and kept me this night from sodeyn death / and also from everlasting
da^pnacyon / by the which nevertheless much people must be separate from the:
the which have not done so many grievous offenses and sins as I have done.
But thou have preserved me to the intent that I may amend mine evil living.
Wherefore I pray the good lord / by thy incomparable mercy / and by the
merytes of thy most blyssed mother and of all saints / that thou wylt keep and
preserve me this day from all manner of deedly sin and evil thoughts and
words / and from all unlawful works to the intent that I may so with a pure
conscience / enter in to thy temple / and there to find thy great mercy /
whereby I shall be worthy to be the temple and habytacyon of the holy ghost /
where thou desyrest to dwell And that I may come to the soueraygne temple of
Jerusalem / there to give the lauds and praises euerlastyngly with all the
saints. Amen.

The.xxii. Chapter / what the man shall say for all christen souls / when he
does pass by the churcheyarde.
Health and conforte be to you all christen souls: whose bodies do rest here
and in every place. Ihesu christ which has boughte you with his precious
blood / deliver you from the innumerable pains of purgatory / and bring you
among the blyssed company of heaven. And there do ye remember us / in prayenge
humbly that we may be in your company / and crowned in heaven with you
euerlastyngly. Amen.

Pater noster. Aue maria. The.xxiii. Chapter / how the man shall dyspose him
self to here mass.
HE that will devoutly and merytoryously here mass in the temple of god / he
shall mount or asce^de.vi. steps or degrees that is to say: that he shall
have in him self six virtues / the which be fygured unto us in the temple of
Solomon / which had six degrees or steps going upward. The first degree
or condycyon is / to desire to be incontinent and without any taryenge at the
service of god / That is to say / that as soon as ye here that they ring the
first pele to mass / ye shall cast down all manner of things out of your
hands / and shall go to the service of god / taking example at the three kings
/ which did leave all manner of thing / and came from the Eest part serchyng
the little child i^ Bethleem at the first token and warning of the sterre.
Wherefore all busynes that come and chance to man going toward the church /
and that he may well let it pass / he shall let it be undone unto another
time. And if he can not let it pass without shame / he shall answer quyckely
/ as David the prophet said. Good lord thou haste made my fete like to the
fete of a heart. Upon this saint Gregorye says / that when a heart does
run upon a high mountain / he does lepe over all that he does mete / and so
shall we do in likewise. For the enemy of god and man which is the devil of
hell / does search somtymes many ways for to draw man from the service of god
/ as from the mass / sermon / even song / and other dyuyne service. Or else
if he can not let him from the hole / yet he will let him from as much as he
may: so that many folks do tarry in the way talking or chiding / or
otherwise occupied till that the service of god is half done. Therefore our
lord god did forbid his dyscyples / to talk or reason with any person in the
high way. Wherefore it is good that the man erely in the morning do go to
mass before that any person may let him. For as Job says / he that erely in
the morning does search for god / he shall find him: for than man has
greater devotion / tha^ at any other time of the day when the wits be
occupied.

The second degree or condycion is humylyte: so that the person ought not to
enter in to the church or temple of god / by great pomp and pride as the
Pharazen did. For many folks (which god amend) go to the church more to be
seen or to se other / than for devotion or the health of their souls / the
which be before god: as the proud Lucyfer was in heaven and Adam in paradyse.
Therefore man shall come to the church with humylyte / as did the Publycane
knocking on his breast saying. O good lord have mercy of me poor sinner. And
than god shall here and exalte his prayer. For saint Bernarde speaks a notable
word / saying that man that does humylyate and meke him self here in earth as
low as he can / god will exalte him as high as he can in heaven. And he yt does
exalt him self here in earth as high as he can / god shall humylyate and cast
him as deep in hell as he can. O merciful god / how deep shall some folks
descend in to hell / which be ashamed through their great pride to humylyate
them self before the. So that i^ heryng mass / some persons do walk up and
down in the church: other some do sytte at their most case / and other some
do knele but of one kne / their bonettes fast nailed to their heddes / and so
did the Jews knele of one kne / when they mocked our lord and did spytte in
his face. O what little knowledge / love and fere have such folks of god: for
the holy au^gelles be standing vpryght with great reverence and fere / before
the face of god. And the proud and stynkynge creature of god the man / does
swell with pride and without any fere or dread. Ye do se that when a man shall
be hedded / that he does knele on both his knees / with his hands joined
together before him that shall do the execucyon: and the poor and wretched
sinner / is ashamed to humylyate him self before god. Here what our lord Ihesu
does speak of the man / he that is ashamed to serve me before the world / I
will be ashamed of him before my father celestyall. Wherefore the man as soon as
he is entered in to the church: shall knele on both his knees with great
humylyte and mekenes of heart in showynge to god his sins / saying. O good
lord have mercy of me poor sinner / or other like words as ye shall find
hereafter written / in the.xxx. Chapter: for such prayer god does exalte / and
does asce^de in to heaven before the face of god / and does not depart from
thens / unto it has obtained all thing that it does demand for the health of
the soul.

The third degree or condycyon / to here mass devoutly / is contrycyon or
repentance of all the deedly sins that the man has done. And when the man
shall thus have mekened and humylyate him self before god / he shall have made
his peace with god: before that he will pray for any thing / For god does hate
the syn^ers / and cannot se them which do not repent them of their sins with
all their hertes. Therefore our lord speaks by the prophet Esaye and says.
When ye enter in to the church and do lift your hands on high to me / I will
turn mine iyes from you: and when ye cry to me / I will not here you / for
your hands be full of blood: that is to say full of syn^e. Of this ye may
have example / if ye will desire and obtain any thing of a prince or of a
great lord / the which is angry with you and does hate you: so that he can
not abide the sight of you / ye must first find the means to content and
pacyfye him. And that done / desire what ye will reasonably and ye shall
obtain. For otherwise as saint Gregory says / ye should provoke him to be
more angry and dyspleased with you. Therefore as Johan Gerson chaunceller of
Paris does write / every man ought one time of the day say this orayson and
prayer following with all devout premedytacyon. For if it do chance that the
man dye suddenly that same day or night: he shall not be dampened nor pryuate of
the sight of the glorious face of god / in case that he do say this prayer
with all his heart / and with co^trycyon and repentance of his sins.

The prayer.
O Most benygne and mercyful god / I knowledge and confess that I have
grievously sinned against thy will and commandment / above the nombre of
sterres. Whereof I am very sorry and contryte i^ my heart / and am sorry that I
can not repent me a hondreth times more than I do. Wherefore good lord / I
undertake from hensforth / that if I do live a ho^dreth years more / I will
keep me (with thy grace) from all deedly sin. And also I have a good and a
ferme will to confess all my sins at the time ordained by the church / and
will also do penance for all my sins after the counceyll of my confessoure.

The fourth degree or condycyon is / to consydre that the man being i^ the
church shall cast all temporal and worldly busynes from his heart / in as
much as he can possible / and only shall occupye him self with god and that
thing that he does read or say / to the intent that he may say with Dauyd.
O good lord I have cried unto the with all my heart. And that is yt thing /
to the which the priest does monysshe and exhort us in the mass saying /
Sursum corda / that is to say / lift up your hertes to almighty god. And than
the clerk does answer in the name of all them that do here the mass /
Habemus ad dominum / which is to say / we have our hertes toward god. O
would to god that it might be always so: for if we did pray as we ought to do
/ we should obtain all thing that we would desire. And therefore god does not
regard the words that we do speak in prayenge / but he desire the heart of
the man. Wherefore Isodorus says: that a prayer made and said only of the
mouth without any premedytacyon / does as much prevail as the kackelynge of
a hen. Wherefore wha^ ye will read any thing in prayenge to god for grace ye
shall say thus. O good lord give me thy dyuyne grace to read and say my prayer
devoutly / to the intent that it may be exalted of the. And if any other thing
come in my mind / I do revoke now as for tha^: this prayer said. God (as saint
Thomas does write) shall receive it all for the best. And therefore the man
shall not coueyte to read much / as some do which have sackes full of books /
and great long bedes / as they would tarry all the day in the church. Yet
nevertheless they will read all in one mass time / not regarding what they do
read. But the man must pray with a very pure heart / for the prayer ought to
be fervent devout / and short of words as our lord does show us in the
gospel. Therefore saint Jerome says: yt one Pater nr^ / said with devotion /
is better and more profitable tha^ an hondreth without devotion. The fyfth
degree or condycyon is scylence so yt the man ought to keep him from much
talking in the church / as many folks do not / as well men as women / young
and old great and small / but there do talk and iangle as they were i^ the
high street. And other some do walk up and down in the church showyng them
self as they were in the market / whereby they do let and trouble other of
their devotion / the which they have not in them self. And other some there
be / which do speak dishonest and vycyous words / no more regardyng the temple
of god than a tavern / whereof the devil does rejoice and is glad. Now is
acco^plysshed that David does speak of the Infydels and Sarazyns saying. Deus
venetu^t gentes / hoc est gentiliter viuentes. etc. that is to say: the
Sarazyns and Infydels / that is to say / the christian people living like unto
Infydels / become in to your heritage: that is io say / in the catholyke faith
/ and have maculate the holy temple. And without doubt / the Jews have
greater reverence in their synagoge / than many christen people have i^ the
temple of god: where god is always present in the holy sacrament of the altar
/ co^syderynge / seeing / and herynge all your words and thoughts. Wherefore
when ye do enter in to the church which is the temple of god / turn your
iyes from the people and remember your sins / and the passion of our lord /
and read some good thing.

The syxte degree or condycyon that man shall have to here mass devoutly / is
perseuerau^ce / so that ye shall here the hole mass from the beginning to the
ending / and shall not out of the church unto it be fynysshed / and that the
priest have given the blyssynge / except great necessyte require it / and
specially on sondayes and other holy days for it is so commanded by the law.
Against this some do offend which do walk in the churcheyarde there talking
and iangelynge / and when the priest does lift our lord in the blyssed
sacrament / they do run and enter in to the church / as the dog in to the
kechynge / and incontinent they do go out again. All those that so do by
custom and does not regard the commandment of the holy church / they do
commit a deedly sin at every time. O good lord what small devotion / love /
and fere have the people of god: they be loathe to bestow one hour to here
mass / serve god / and norysshe the soul: but they be not loathe to myspende
three or four hours at the table in eating and drinking / for to norysshe
the body the which shall rote and be eten with worms. O man remember of what
virtue the blyssynge which the priest does give after the mass is / for his
hands have mynystred at the altar: the blyssed body of our lord Ihesu
christ. So god in the old Testament did bliss the children / which were
blyssed of their fathers / as Abraham blyssed his sone Isaac: Isaac blyssed his
sone Jacob / and Jacob all his children of the.xii. generacyons of Israel / by
the which blyssynge god often times did save and deliver them from many perils
and euylles. Much more god will be mercyful unto us and keep us from so dayne
death: if we do receive with all humylyte the blyssynge of the priest / at the
end of his mass / for his hands be much more holy / tha^ were the hands of
the old fathers. And by the blyssynge of the priest / we be made worthy of the
blyssynge of our lord god in heaven. Therefore when the priest gives the
blyssynge after mass / ye shall knele down upon your knees: with your heed
bare and inclyned toward the ground / in receyuynge the same. Whereof we have
many fair examples / the which should be to prolyxe and long to descrybe. Yet
never theles ye shall have twain in short words here declared.

Example.
WE read that there was a couereur of howses: which being upon the top or
hyghte of a house there workynge / suddenly fell down to the ground / without
hurtyng him self or having any manner of harm. The people seeing this did
run unto him / thinking that he was deed / and they did find him hole and
sound: and they did say unto him. Thou haste ben well blyssed this day / He
answered and said it is true: for I had this day the blyssynge / which the
priest gave after the mass / whose hands had touched the body of our lord
Ihesu christ. And my faith and believe was / that after the blyssynge which I
received humbly after the mass I should not dye suddenly without confession /
as now ye may se.

Example.
WE read moreover of two men which were co^paygnons and fellows in
marchaundyse / of the which the one received always the blyssynge of the
priest / and the other never did regard nor care for it. And one day as they
were going in their journey / there came a great tempest of thondre and
lyghtnynge / of the which tempest he that was never wont to receive the
blyssynge of the priest nor to regard it / was stryken to death / and the other
which was always wont to receive the blyssynge / was saved and not hurt.

The.xxiiii. Chapter / what thing a man shall read when he comes first
before the holy sacrament.
Orayson.
O Blissed and merciful lord Ihesu christ / I commend this day in the
presence of thy holy body and at all times: my soul and my body by the virtue
of thy holy natyuyte: thy blyssed cross / and sharp and bitter passion / and
thy glorious resurreccyon. O father everlasting god almighty / thou art the
beginning and the end of all creatures / thou art the way and the truth and
the health of al men. O father everlasting / I cry and call pryncypally unto
the for my help and aid / by the virtue of the holy sacrament / to the intent
that thou wylt defend me from all thing that may be hurtful to the health of
my soul. Albeit that I am a poor sinner / Yet nevertheless I am thy unworthy
creature / redeemed and delivered by the precious blood of thy sone. And I
believe steadfastly in the: wherefore good lord defend me always from all
perils and dangers of mine enemies vysyble and inuysyble / and from all
venom and poison in metes and drynkes / from shame and sudden death / by the
virtue of the holy sacrament / in the which I put all my hope and believe. O
holy and most worthy sacrament in the which be united i^ godhed / the father /
the sone / and the holy ghost / thou do exalt all that do cry and call unto
the and that do believe in the. Therefore exalte me now specially in all that is
necessary and helthful for my soul / and that from hensforth I may
accomplysshe and fulfill thy will.

The.xxv. Chapter / what thing the man shall read / when he comes before
the holy cross of our lord Ihesu christ.
O Lord Ihesu christ / I pray the by the virtue of the same orayson and
prayer / that thou dyddest make in great anguysshe and pain of heart / under
the mount of Olyuete: where for fere and dread of death / thou dyddest sweet
drops of blood rennynge down to the ground. Offer and show that same blood
to thy father celestyall / against the multitude of my sins / and deliver me
at the hour of death / from all fere and dread which I have deserved for my
sins.

Pater noster. Aue maria. O Lord Ihesu christ which has dyed upon the
cross for me poor sinner / I pray the yt thou wylt show and offer to thy
father celestyall / all the pain and bytternes of thy passion / and specially
when thy blyssed soul departed out of thy blyssed body / against the multitude
of my sins. And deliver me at the hour of death from all pain / which I
have deserved for the multitude of my sins. Amen.

Pater noster. Aue maria. O Lord Ihesu christ / I pray the by the
inestymable love: that caused the to descend from heaven unto earth / there to
suffer death upon the cross most cruelly for me poor syn^er / to show and
offer the same unto thy father celestyal: against the multitude of my sins.
And after this life to open me the gate of heaven. Amen.

Pater noster. Aue maria. The.xxvi. Chapter / what thing the man shall read /
when he does come before the Image of our Lady.
O Most benygne Mary daughter of the father of heaven mother of the sone of god
/ espouse of the holy ghost: I pray the that as the father celestyall of his
great might and power has exalted the in the highest trone of heaven / so I
pray the most benygne vyrgyne and mother mary / to socoure and help me and all
my friends. And to defend us from the te^ptacyons of our enemy. Amen.

Aue maria. O Most humble mother of Ihesu christ Mary: thou art a paradyse of
joy and the hyd treasor of the secret of god: I pray the yt as the son of god
of the might and power of his inco^prehensyble wisdom has aorned the / that
over and above all the saints thou should use and have the fruycyon most
perfytly / of the face and presence of the holy trynyte: so I pray the most
pure virgyn mary / that thou stand by me and assyste me and all my friends at
the hour of death / in remplysshynge and in putting in our souls / the light
of the holy catholyke faith / to the intent that our faith / be not occupied
with error.

Aue maria. O Most sweet mary / beauty of the aungelles / flower of the
patryarkes / maystres of the apostelles / courage of the martyrs / sweet
fou^tayne of the co^fessours honor and joy of vyrgynes / consolacyon and
solace of all sinners / I pray the that as the holy ghoost has remplysshed
and filled the of his swetnes and dyuyne grace to the intent that thou be the
most benygne and merciful next after god / so I beseech the most holy and
imaculate vyrgyne mary / that thou wylt be present by me and all my friends
after the time of our life: in shedynge and putting in to our souls the
swetenes of the dyuyne dyseccyon and love / so that we may joy with the and
with all saints euerlastyngly. Amen.

The xxvii. Chapter / how he that does help the mass ought to behave him.
First he that does serve and help the priest at mass / he must beware
that he do not behold the priest / in the face.

Seco^daryly / that which he does give to the priest / he shall give it with
both his hands.

Thyrdly / he shall be dylygent to prove and know the water from the wine.

Fourthly / he shall absteyne in as much as he may / from to much spyttynge
and kowghynge or making any noise / specially when the priest is in his
Memento.

Fyfthly / he shall not greatly give his mind to read any prayers in the mass
time: but rather shall take heed dylyge^tly that there do lack nothing / and
shall keep dogs from the altar.

Syxtly / he shall not knele between the courteyne and the altar / in
beholdynge what the priest does upon the altar. Also he shall not knele behind
the curteynes: but shall be of the one side of the priest / partly behind him.

Seventhly / he shall take heed that he do answer the priest perfytely: and
that he do light the candell of wax in time / and to put it out when the
priest after the mass has given the blyssynge. And when the priest has
fynysshed his first Memento / he shall prepare him self to light the torche
or candell in time / and to ring the little bell to the eleuacyon.

Eyghtly / he shall take heed that he be pure and clean in his conscience /
that is to say that he have contrycyon of all his sins / and also that he be
clean without i^ his body and in his hands: so that he do not fyle the book
towelles / altar clothes / or other aorneme^tes. He shall take heed also /
that he do not touch the chalyce / patyne / or corporas / for if he do he does
offend.

Nynthly / he shall fold the vestementes and the aornementes honestly after
the mass: and shall lay them in their place. And this done he may deserve and
merit much.

The.xxviii. Chapter / how every man shall gladly help and serve at the
mass / for six reasons.
THe first reason is / for the service that we do to the priest in the mass
time / god will reward us for it as we had done it unto him self: for the
priest is not there before the altar as sir John^: but he is there as the sone
of god has hanged upon the cross

The second reason is / that to serve god the man of him is made. And therefore
there is no man so mighty of power nor so noble / that ought to be ashamed to
serve god. For our lord Ihesu christ says / he that is ashamed to serve me:
I will also be ashamed of him before my father celestyall. O with what love and
dylygence should we serve him / which has given sight unto us being blind /
the which (we being pryuate of our hands and fete) has restored them
again unto us: and we being deed he has resuscytate us to life / and much
more has god done for us.

The third reason is / for to the intent yt we serve our lord god / he has
commanded his au^gelles to serve us and to keep us / to the intent that we may
come to heaven / where the sone of god him self shall serve us. The fourth
reason is / for to the intent yt we should be more bound to serve him / he
has made him self man mortal / and has served us in his own person / by
the space of.xxxiii. years in great poverty and myserye / wherefore by all
right we be bound to serve him. And yet much more has he don for us / he
has shed his blood for us / and suffered death for us / to the intent that we
may reygne with him in his glory.

The fyfth reason is / for god has made all things to serve us / as in heaven
the au^gelles / the son / the moon / and the fyrmame^t / in the air the
birds / in earth the beestes and other creatures: in the water the fysshes to
the intent that by them we should be monysshed to serve him.

The syxte reason is / for god shall give him that gladly does help and serve
at the mass / a synguler reward in heaven / more than to other herynge the
mass only / as it is written.

The.xxix. Chapter / what fruytes he receives of god / that serves gladly
and devoutly at the mass.
THe first virtue is / that god does never suffer such a person to fall so
far in sin / but that he shall rise sooner out of the same by true penance
/ than another that does not help ne serve at the mass.

The second virtue or fruit is / that such a person is not only preserved
and kept as another man of his propre angel / but also there be many other
aungelles nyghe unto him: and always ready to help him and prayenge for him.

The third virtue is / that the good works which he does / be more
acceptable unto god and more profitable to men / as well living as being deed
/ than of other which do not help and serve at the mass.

The fourth virtue is: that he which does help and serve at the mass / shall
be in all his busynes and causes more dyscryte and wise than other men.

The fyfth virtue is / that the mercy of god shall never forsake that man i^
his great necessyte / but shall always be ready at his most need.

The syxte virtue is / that god shall give him / which devoutly and dylygently
helps and serves at the mass: a synguler grace here in earth / and a great
reward in heaven / as he says i^ the gospel / he that does serve and mynystre
unto me in the earth / he shall be honored of my father i^ heaven. For to help
and serve at the mass / is a service appertaynynge unto aungelles. Yet
nevertheless god will be served of man in earth. Therefore every man ought
gladly help and serve at the mass / for it is no shame / but great honor to
serve god. The fathers ought to cause their children to learn to help mass /
for that person shall not serve god in heaven: which has not served him in
earth.

The.xxx. Chapter / if women may help and serve at the mass.
YT is prohybyte and forbid in the Canon law / for women to preche openly / or
to give insence upon the altar / or to touch the chalyce / the patyne / or
corporas. And therefore the women shall not wasshe the lynnen clothes of the
same before that the priest has washed them. But that women may not help the
mass / we have not so great commandment in the law / for the holy church
does admyt the spyrytuall persons: and maidens may help and serve at the
mass i^ necessyte / which they shall not do if there be any man present that
can do it. wherefore the maidens wha^ they shall help the mass in necessytye /
they shall always look devoutly before them / and shall not behold the priest
in the face / But they shall knele down honestly behind the pressed and shall not
come to nere the altar for the dygnyte of the holy sacrament.

The.xxxi. Chapter / if the mynyster may help and serve and here the holy
mass all together. And also if a man may here many masses together and at one
time with as great merit / as if he herd every mass by it self.
AS the doctors do write: the life of all good and just catholyke people is
as a company of merchants in the which that yt the one does win the other
does lease. So it is with all them that be in the love and grace of god and of
holy church / so that they be not only part takers of the mass at the which
they be present with their iyes / but also so long as they be in the state of
grace and i^ the love of god / they be part takers of all the good deeds that
be done in the holy church through out all this world / of all good and just
catholyke people. And the contrary is of them which be in deedly sin /
which do not merit for them self any reward i^ heaven / for they be deed
before god and also their good works. O if the syn^er did remember this in
taking it to the heart / what goodness should come unto him.

The.xxxii. Chapter / what the aornementes of the priest / does sygnyfye.
First the altar where the priest says the mass / does sygnyfye the cross
of our lord god.

Item the priest at the altar / does sygnyfye our lord upon the cross. Item
the chalyce before the priest / does sygnyfye the sepulcher of our lord.

Item the corporas sygnyfyeth the lynne^ cloth / in the which our lord was
wrapped in the sepulcher.

Item the lynnen cloth of the chalyce / sygnyfyeth the little cloth put upon
the face of our lord in the sepulcher / for to wype the sweet.

Item the patyne of the chalyce sygnyfyeth the stone that did cover the
sepulcher. Item the amys which the priest does put on his heed / sygnyfyeth the
cloth which the Jews did bind before the iyes of our lord when they did mock
him.

Item the albe which is white and long / sygnyfyeth the white and long robe
/ wherewith Herod did cloth our lord in derysyon.

Item the long stoyle that the priest has about his neck / sygnyfyeth the
cord the which the Jews did cast about the neck of our lord / and
afterward about his body when they did take him in the garthen. Item the short
stoyle or maniple the which the priest has on his left arm sygnyfyeth the
cord with the which the hands of our lord were bound / for when they did
unbind him they left the cord hanging at the left hand.

Item the cord / wherewith the priest is gyrde / sygnyfyeth the cord wherewith
our lord Ihesus was bound to the pyller. Item the chesuble which is the
upper vestement of the priest / closed behind and before and without fasshon
open of both sides / sygnyfyeth the robe of purple / wherewith Pylate did
cloth our lord when he did mock him.

Item the cross upon the chesuble upon the sholdres of the priest and goth to
the ground behind / sygnyfyeth the heuye cross of our lord of.xv. foot of
length / the which he bare upon his sholdres upon the mount of Caluarye.

Item the crown of the heed of the priest does sygnyfye the crown of thorns
/ which our lord ware upon his heed.

Item the little peaces upon the albe upon the hands of the priest / and also
hangyng behind and before at the fete of the priest / do sygnyfye the great
nails / which were stryken through the hands and fete of our lord upon the
cross.

Item the bread which is consecrate / is verily the blyssed body of our
lord / And the wine after the consecracyon / is the precious blood of our
lord habundau^tly shed upon the cross. This may a simple person which can
not read thus think and remember in the mass time / and to occupye him self
with the passion of our lord.

The.xxxiii. Chapter / what virtue or fruit does consyst and lie in devoutly
herynge mass: the which virtues be in.xii. manners.
THe first virtue or fruit is / as some doctors do write / that the man does
merit more whiles that he does here mass deuoutely / than if he should give
for gods sake / as much ground and land as he could pass and go over in
the space of the same mass. O what may he than deserve which does here every
day three or four masses. And what does he lease / and what compte shall he
make before god at the day of judgment / which has not so great business /
but that he may here one mass at the left every day. O what it shall grieve
you that ye have lost so much. This ye shall understand according to the
dygnyte and excellentnes of the mass.

The second virtue is / that the holy au^gelles be glad to be nyghe unto that
person in keeping him when he has herd mass. As David says / god did
command his aungelles to keep and preserve you / in all your ways and
busynes.

The third virtue is: that the man beholdynge with devotion and reverence the
holy sacrament in the mass / as saint Austyn says / god does give him that
same day al things necessary for his body. Item vain words and unadvised
oaths be forgyuen and pardoned / and he is preserved from sodayn death. A man
does lease no time whiles that he does here mass. All the steps in coming
and in going / be compted of the holy angel. And if the man dyed the same
day that he has herd mass without receyuynge the sacrament / god shall
compte it as spyrytually received.

The fourth virtue is / that the person being in sin often times in the mass
time by the presence of the holy sacrament / does receive a good i^spyracion:
so that from the^sforth he does convert him from his sins As the good thief
upon the cross / Mary Magdaleyne before the fete of our lord. If they had not
ben present with our lord / perauenture they should not have had pardon of
their sins.

The fyfth virtue or fruit is: yt the man herynge mass devoutly / receives
spu^ally the holy sacrament so that he desire it devoutly. And so it may
chance that the man herynge mass devoutly / shall obtain more grace than the
priest which does it / for the priest is not always egally well disposed And
so may the man every day / receive the holy sacrament spyrytually.

The syxte virtue is / that the man herynge mass and being in the state of
grace / is part taker of all the masses done throughout all the world / and
that is more or less after as the man is in the love and favor of god. For
it is one of the artycles of the holy catholyke faith / as in the co^munyon of
the holy church.

The seventh virtue is / that the prayer of them which do here the mass / is
sooner herd and exalted of god in the mass time / than at any other time /
for than the priest and the holy au^gelles which be about the altar do help
you to pray.

The eight virtue is / that the souls being in purgatory / whiles that the
man does here the mass and does pray for them have a synguler absolucyon
during the same mass / for there is nothing that does bring them so
shortly out of the pains of purgatory / as to cause to say or to here
devoutly mass for them.

The nynth virtue is / that it is better to here one mass in our life time:
than to cause an hondreth to be said or herd for us after our death. And also
that it is better that the man cause a mass to be said for him in his life:
tha^ an hondreth after his death. The reason is / for the man may now deserve
and merit much with a mass / but not after his death: but only that he does
find that thing / which he has deserved in his life. An hondreth thousa^de
masses now done can not augment one moment of glory and joy after this time:
but by a mass which I do here / I may obtain that I shall not come in
purgatory / but after our death / the mass delyuereth only from purgatory.
Is it not better than not to come in to purgatory / than when a man is there
to tarry and look for aid and help to be delivered. The tenth virtue is / that
a woman heryng mass devoutly / if it chance that she do labor of child that
same day / she shall be delivered (without fault) the more easily and with
less pain / for the holy au^gelles be very busye and dylygent about her.
Therefore all women being with child / if it be possible shall here mass
every day for by the virtue of the same / the fruit or child is preserved.
And tha^ shall put their trust in the holy sacrament and in our blyssed Lady
the mother of god / and in none other thing.

The eleventh virtue is / that all thing that man does enterprise after that
he has herd mass / does prospere and com to good end. And that which the
man does eat and drink after he has herd mass / does profit more to the
necessyte of nature.

The twelfth virtue is / that if the man dye the same day that he has herd
mass / god shall give him a synguler grace which otherwise he should not have
had. That is say to that god him self or his aungelles at the last hour of
his death: shall help and conforte him as the man has served god at the mass.
For it is written in the holy gospel / with the same measure that ye have
measured / with the same also I will measure you euerlastyngly. Amen.

Thus ends the first book of the mass. And here follows the second.
Prologue.
HEre begins the second book of the mass which is dyuyded in three: as the
life of our lord is dyuyded in three diverse times / and these three times be
co^prehende in.xxxiii. years. Also the mass is dyuyded in three parties / and
the three parties in.xxxiii. artycles. The first time is / from his humanyte
unto his passion / and that does sygnyfye the beginning of the mass: unto the
Canon or Sanctus.

The second time / from his passion unto his resurreccyon / and that does
sygnyfye from Sanctus unto that the priest have received the sacrament.

The third time / from that unto the fynysshynge of the mass / and that does
sygnyfye after his resurreccyon / unto that time that our lord did ascend i^
to heaven. Upon every time is a prayer / by the which a man may deserve very
pardon. As of our Lady.xi.M. years / in the honor of his humanyte: of saint
Gregorye.xlvi.M. years / and in the honor of his passion and
resurreccyon.lxxx.M. years. Som^e. C.xxxvii.M. years: and at every article is a
devout prayer as to pray to almighty god to obteyn some virtue or to eschew
sin.

The holy father pope Syxtus the.iiii. of that name / has given.xi.M. years of
pardon so often as in the state of grace / with devotion a man does say this
prayer following before the Image of our Lady: in the which prayer a man may
clearly understand and perceive / that Mary the holy mother of our lord Ihesu
christ / is a pure and a clean vyrgyne / and was conceived without any spotte
of orygynall sin / the which is clearly declared in this prayer / where it
is said / thou art conceived without sin. And of this indulge^ce or pardon
/ is a fair Bull in the city of Coleyne.

BLyssed be thou Mary holy mother of god / queen of heaven / gate of paradyse /
lady of the world / thou art a synguler pure vyrgyne conceived without syn^e
Thou haste borne and ben delivered of the creatoure / redemoure / and sauyoure
of this world / wherein I do not doubt but steadfastly do believe. Pray for my
sins and deliver and keep me from all evil. Amen.

The first Article of the mass.
How the priest does make him ready in the vestry to say mass / and the
deacon and subdeacon do help him / but the priest alone does take and cast
upon him the chesuble: which does sygnyfie how christ has taken upon him the
nature of man / and was conceived in the vestry of the blyssed body of our lady
/ wherein the father and the holy ghost have given aid and help The mynystrer
or he that does help to serve at the mass / does sygnyfye the angel
Gabryell.

Orayson. Pater nr^. Aue maria. O Blyssed lord Ihesu christ / I do thank the
that by the will of thy father celestyall / thou have ben conceived by the
operacyon of the holy ghoost / in the blyssed body of the vyrgyne mary in all
clennes and without any spotte of sin / I beseech the good lord by the merit
of thy dear mother / that I which have been conceived in malice and sin / may
be puryfyed of all my sins. Amen.

The second article of the mass.
How the priest does go out of the vestry toward the altar with the deacon
and subdeacon: where he does tarry a little space between the^ with scylence /
the which does sygnyfye / how Ihesus was borne between Joseph and our lady /
and laid between an Ox and an Ass.

Orayson. Pater nr^. Aue maria. O Blyssed lord Ihesu christ / I do thank the
because thou have wylled to be borne after the nature of man / of the vyrgyne
mary in this world for our sins / for the which sins thou have afterward
suffered death upon the cross: I beseech the good lord give me grace so to bear
the cross of penance herein earth for my sins / that I may come to thy
glory in heaven. Amen.

The third article of the mass.
How the priest being between the^ says with great devotion Confiteor / and
does confess him self as a syn^er / albeit that he has confessed him self
before of all his deedly sins: which does sygnyfye that the innocent child
Ihesus / did suffer him self to be cyrcumcysed as a pure and a clean myrrour
without any spotte.

Orayson. Pater nr^. Aue maria. O Blyssed lord Ihesu christ / I do humbly
thank the for thou have suffered thy self to be cyrcu^cysed on the.viii. day
/ after thy natyuyte with a knyfe of stone / for to take away the vengeance
of our sins / and have commanded that thy holy name should be Ihesus / I
pray the dear lord grant me thy dyuyne grace / that I may cyrcumcyse me
with the knyfe of thy dyuyne fere and dread from all evil te^ptacions / that I
may laud and praise thy holy name Ihesus euerlastyngly. Amen.

The fourth article of the mass.
How the priest after Co^fiteor gothe to the altar with great reverence / and
lowly inclynyng him self does worship god almighty / which does sygnyfye
unto us / how the three Kings with great reverence and devotion / have
worshypped the sweet child Ihesu / and have humbly given him their offrynges.

Orayson. Pater nr^. Aue maria. O Blyssed lord Ihesu christ / I do thank the
that thou haste wytsau^e to show and manifest thy self to the three kings /
by the tokenynge of a shynynge sterre: and has brought them home again in to
their own country by another way / I beseech the good lord to illumyne the
obscuryte and darkness of my conscience / by the light of thy grace / that I
may give and offer myrre of fervent devotion / insence of busye and dylygent
prayer / and gold of dyuyne dyleccyon / that I may come to the way of health.
Amen.

The fyfth article of the mass.
HOw the priest after that with great reverence does begin the mass /
between deacon and subdeacon at the one side of the altar: which does
sygnyfie that Ihesus was presented in the temple / upon the altar of the
soueraygne priest / with great devotion and reverence between Joseph and Mary /
and his other friends.

Orayson. Pater nr^. Aue maria. O Blyssed lord Ihesu christ / I thank the
that thou have suffered devoutly and obedyently thy self to be presented i^ the
temple by the soueraygne priest to the intent that we may be present in heaven

HEre ends the second book of the mass / treating of the life / passion /
and resurreccyon of our lord Ihesu christ / in the which every good catholyke
person may be in his devotion occupied / and specially in the mass time. For
as doctors do write there be.xii. virtues in remembrynge the life and passion
of our lord.

The first virtue is / that the sinner often times is converted thereby / from
his evil and perverse living to good and holy living so that god grant him
repentance of his sins / true confession and penance before his death.

The second virtue is / that the remembrance of the passion of our lord is a
medycyne against the te^ptacyon of the devil. For how great soever the
temptacyon be / if the man remember cordyally the passion of our lord /
tournynge his iyes devoutly upon the cross of god / he shall be delivered from
the temptacyon.

The third virtue is / that our lord will make a sure and a steadfast peace
between the sinner and his father celestyall.

The fourth virtue is / that all trybulacyons: aduersytes / syckenes / dyseases
/ displeasures / and temptacyons / shall be easy and light for that man to
bear / which does remember the passion of our lord. For saint Gregorye says
/ there is no grefe / disease / nor displeasure / but we may lightly
vaynquysshe it / if we do remember devoutly the passion of our lord.

The fyfthe virtue is / that such a person has more knowledge of god what his
will is to be done or not to be done / tha^ the other. The syxte virtue is /
that our lord gives devotion to such men and does exalt their prayer. And
therefore when the man is dry of devotion / he shall turn him self to the
passion of our lord where he shall find swetnes and abundaunt devotion / And
also wha^ any man will pray to our lord for any thing / be it for him self
or for any other quycke or deed / he shall occupye him self first in one of
the artycles of the passion of our lord: wherein he has the most devotion: and
in such medytacyon he shall pray / and without doubt if the thing that he
does desire be to the health of his soul / he shall obtain it or else a
better.

The seventh virtue is / as saint Bernarde says / that god is present and nere
to him that does remember his passion / and so often as the man does draw his
breath and does take it of the air / so often does he receive a special grace
in his soul.

The eight virtue / is that the man in remembrynge hertely the passion of our
lord / may obtain more grace than if all the holy churches / or all the men
in the world should pray for him.

The nynth virtue is / that the remembrance and medytacyon of our lord Ihesu
christ / does pass and surmount all other corporal operacyo^s / and is
acceptable unto god above all things / after that man has done true penance
for his sins. For as Albertus magnus does write / it is better for man to
remember one point of the passion of our lord / than to fast an hole year
bread and water: or to scourge him self till he make the blood run out / or
to say the hole psalter.

The tenth virtue is / that the hertye and fervent medytacyon of the passion of
our lord is more profitable to man / than if our lady and all the saints in
heaven did pray for him: that is to understand according and after the dygnyte
of the passion of god For in the prayer of saints does not consyste our
health: as in the passion of our lord Ihesu christ.

The eleventh virtue is / yt the man which has lost and myspent his young age
/ may recover that which he has lost and consumed / if devoutly and hertely
he occupy and exercise him self with the passion of god: So that in short
space he may obtain as great reward of god / as another in long time which
does not occupye him self in the passion of god.

The twelfth virtue is / that god shall aid and conforte such a man in the
hour of death / and shall not depart from him unto he come to a good end /
and sauely be brought to everlasting life. To the which the father / the sone
/ and the holy ghost bring us all. Amen.

Here begins the third book / containing and showynge how a man shall
confess him and prepare him self to receive the holy and blyssed Sacrament /
and what he shall read than.
The prologue.
EGo su^ panis viuus qi de celo desce^dit: si qis ma^du cauerit ex hoc pane /
viuet i^eternu^. Iohi^s sexto In the which words our lord does rese^ble him
self to bread saying. I am the living bread / he that does eat of this
bread shall live euerlastyngly / not that this bread after the consecracyon
does live / but this bread is converted in to lively flesh and blood /
albeit that it does resemble and appear like bread / And that for four
reasons.

First / for the bread noryssheth the man more than any other meat / so also
the holy Sacrament does norysshe the soul of man above all thing / for a
thing is full wha^ there can no more enter therein. The soul of man is of so
great importau^ce: that no creature in heaven nor in earth can or may fill it /
but god only which has made and fourmed it. This ye may consydre / for
albeit yt man should have all the joy and all the goods of the world / yet
would he more have and desire / as those that have a thousand pou^des / would
yet have.x. thousand / and those that have.x. thousand / would have.xx.
thousand. And therefore the heart of man is never content / have he never so
much: except that he have god in his soul / for he is so great that he only
can fill satysfye and content it. And therefore they do err which do say / if
I had such a thing I should be content. O man / if thou had all the world
as king Alexandre had / if thou have not our lord Ihesu christ in thy heart
yet shall thou not be content. For as saint Austyn says. O good lord thou
have made us after thy dyuyne Image and lykenes. And therefore our heart is not
content till it come unto the / my heart may be occupied with and in all
things / but thou only good lord may remplysshe and fill it.

Secondaryly / our lord does resemble him self to bread / for naturally a
man can not live without bread / and bread does fortyfye the heart and
gives life to man / So spyrytually the man can not live in the soul / without
using and receyuynge reverently the holy sacrament / For by receyuynge
reverently the holy sacrament / a man does not only live but also he is
preserved here in earth / in virtue / i^ prosperyte / in grace and also
hereafter in heaven in joy / which god him self has promised us saying / He
that does eat of this bread shall live euerlastyngly.

Thyrdly: albeit that the bread is necessary for man as concerning the body /
yet nevertheless it is very evil and dangerous eaten in four manners. So is it
also of the holy sacrament which is the bread of the soul.

First / the bread eaten in anger and with impacyence / brings and causes
great disease and syckenes to the man: for the natural hete of the man which
does consume and dysgest the meat / does apply and give it self to the anger
and impacyentnes / and not to the meat. So is it also with them that receive
the holy sacrament being in malice and envy: for their sins whereof they be
confessed / be not pardoned and forgyuen them And as saint Ambrose writes /
the man receives of god such pardon of his sins / as he gives and
pardons his neighbor and even christen / for such persons do set their
minds more to dystroye their enemies / than to serve god.

Seco^daryly / he that does eat the bread or meat which is not well handled
/ dressed or appointed / shall find it very unwholesome. So is it also with them
that do receive the holy sacrament / without a fervent preparacyon of devotion
/ as of contrycyon and confession which be necessary for the man. For as saint
Paul says / the man shall prove him self first / that is to say how he
is dysposed in his conscience / before that he receive the holy sacrament / and
than he shall go there.

Thyrdly / it is very unwholesome to take and eat to much of bread or of mete:
for all fyllynge and excess and specially of bread is evil as the Phesycyens
do say. So is it also of the holy sacrament / that is to say / when the man
will inquire further and know more tha^ it does belong unto him where it is
commanded unto him to know or to believe / he does fall in a great disease and
syckenes in his soul as the Herytykes which believe not in the holy sacrament:
because that it is above their understanding / the which (as Solomon says)
be spoiled of grace and of glory hereafter in heaven. For as saint Bonauenture
says / there be.xxiii. mysteryes hyd and closed in the sacrament which do
surmount and pass all our understanding.

Fourthly / the bread or meat is not wholesome if that the man do sleep
incontinent after that he have taken it / for thereby do proceed and come fevers
and other dyseases as Auycene says. So is it also of the holy sacrament / that
is to say / when the man after that he has received the holy sacrament does
fall incontinent again in to deedly sin / so that he does not keep the grace
of the holy sacrament / he does lease all his virtues by him done / and his
soul is deed before god. And so long as he is yet in sin / so long he is in
dampnacyon of his soul. Therefore saint Johan Euangelyste says be well ware
that thou do not lease that / yt thou have done / to the end that thou may
receive a great reward in heaven.

Fourthly / wherefore our lord does resemble him self to bread is / that in
all manner that the natural bread is appointed and labored for the profit of
the body / so is also the living bread spyrytually appointed / in the holy
sacrament.

First / for to saw the corn fructefully a man must take the time
conuenyent for the same / as the last part of the year. This does sygnyfie
how our lord had made him self man / in the last age of this world / when
it had dured.v.M.C.xcix. years.

Secondaryly / by the sede cast in to the earth / we understand the humanyte
of our lord buried and couerte in earth.

Thyrdly / by the earth in the which the sede was cast / we understand the
blyssed body of our lady / in the which our lord has rested.

Fourthly / the earth ought to be donged yt it may be fertyll / and yet always
it is esteemed as nothing worth. We understand by this the parfounde humylyte
of the blyssed vyrgyne mary / the which did not repute and esteem her self to
be the worthy servant of our lord god.

Fyfthly / the earth must be labored and turned. This does sygnyfye how mary
was turned by consent to receive the sone of god in her vyrgynall womb.

Syxtly / there is a servant that does led and guide the horses tournynge the
earth. This does sygnyfie the angel Gabryell berynge the message / and
dysyrynge her consent.

Seventhly / the earth ought to be moist with the rain celestyall / for
otherwise the corn would not spring and come forth of the ground / which
does sygnyfye the holy ghost descended from heaven / making the blyssed vyrgyne
mary apt and mete to be the mother of the sone of god / and she to be still a
vyrgyne.

Eyghtly / the corn is covered under the earth that a man can not se it. This
does sygnyfye the meruaylous concepcyon of our lord / by the which the
humanyte was united with the deyte / the which thing how it was done / it
does pass the understanding of all creatures.

Nynthly / after that the corn has been a long space in the earth / and that
it is ripe / it is cut and laid on the ground. This does sygnyfye how after
that our lord had rested nine months in the womb of our lady / he was borne
lyenge upon the cold earth. Tenthly / when the corn has rested a little upon
the ground / it is taken up and bound together. This does sygnyfye how our
lady did take up her dear sone from the ground / byndynge his members in poor
lynnen clothes.

Eleuenthly / after that the corn is so bound / it is laid in the grange or
barn. This does sygnyfye how our lady did lay her child in the crybbe of an
Ox stall: between an Ox and an Ass.

Twelfthly / when the corn has been a certain space in the grange or barn /
and that the man will use it to his profit / it is taken and cast down from
the mow to be thrasshed. This does sygnyfye how after that our lord had
rested.xxxiii. years / he was taken from the company of his dyscyples by the
Jews / who cast him down to the earth.

The.xiii. the corn is thrasshed and all to bette on every side high and low.
This does sygnyfye how the Jews did cast him down most cruelly before
them / betynge and scourgynge him / high and low: before and behind and on
every side / those that were the servants of Pylate and the Jews. The.xiiii.
a man does cleanse it and cast it in the fan from one side to another. This
sygnyfyeth how sweet Ihesus was sent and led from Annas to Cayphas / from
Cayphas to Pylate / from Pylate to Herod / and again from Herod to Pylate /
as from one Judge to another.

The.xv. the corn is gronne and broken so yt there is no part thereof left
hole. This does sygnyfye how our lord being bound to a pyller / was so sore
bette / scourged and wounded / that from the top of his heed unto the solles
of his fete was not one place left hole. The two heuye stones of the myll /
were the Jews and Romans / as the servants and sergeauntes of Pylate.
The.xvi. the corn thus broken is cyfted and caused to pass through the cyue /
which is full of little holes. This does sygnyfye how Ihesus after that he
was scourged was crowned with a crown of thorn / the which did make many
holles in his blyssed heed whereof did ten down his blyssed blood abundauntly.

The.xvii. the sweet flower or mele / is mynged or myxte / with daughe or sour
paste. This does sygnyfye how Pylate has given and myxte the bitter sentence
of death / with the humanyte of our lord Ihesu christ.

The.xviii. the bread thus myxte and made / it is covered with a cloth. This
does sygnyfye how after the sentence given by Pylate / the Jews did cloth our
lord again with his own clothes.

The.xix. the bread begins to ascend and rise. This does sygnyfye how
sweet Ihesus charged with the heuye cross / did ascend up to the mount of
Caluerye.

The.xx. the oven is prepared for to bake the bread. This does sygnyfye that
the Jews did prepare the cross / for to crucyfye our lord upon the same.

The.xxi. the fire is put in to the oven / wherewith it is made hot. This
does sygnyfye the brennynge and fervent love / wherewith the heart of our lord
was kyndled and set on fire for to save mankind.

The.xxii. the cooles and ashes be drawn out of the oven and the oven made
clean. This does sygnyfye how our lord ones again was spoiled of his robes
by the Jews / and was left all naked.

The.xxiii. the bread is put in to the oven to be baked. This does sygnyfie
that the Jews did cast our lord upon the cross and there did fasten and
nail him with great nails.

The.xxiiii. than the oven is just stopped that there go none air forth of
it. This does sygnyfye that the son was dark and stopped from his light at
the death of our lord Ihesu christ.

Finally when the bread is well baked it is drawn out of the oven. This does
sygnyfye how after that our lord was well dried and baked with the hete of the
son / he was taken down from the cross. And as a man does shytte and lock
up the breades so was the body of our lord buried / shytte fast and kept /
and the third day did rise from death. All this done / the bread is perfyte /
whereof our lord Ihesu christ does speak saying. I am the living bread
descended from heaven: all those that do eat of this bread shall live
euerlastyngly. O what it is sweet to here in the eres of sinners. Our lord
does move and exorte us poor sinners spoiled and void of all virtues / to
receive his blyssed body for the meat and reseccyon of our soul. But O good
lord man may say / what am I that would presume to receive the: for neither
heaven nor earth can not co^prehende the / and shall I receive the. O good lord
/ how shall I be so bold as to receive the / which has done no manner of
good before thy face / but often times have grieved and offended thy dyuynyte. The
holy aungelles tremble for fere in thy presence and the just men fere and doubt
thy power: and yet exhorts and moves me to receive the. O most benygne lord
Ihesu if thou had not spoken this / who would believe it. If thou had not
commanded this / who would have been so bold as to do it. Noe the just and
good man was an hondreth years in preparynge a ship to save eight persons.
And how might I prepare my self in so little space to receive the / which
have made heaven / earth and all creatures. Moses thy faithful servant and
friend / made a tabernacle of precious wode covered with gold / for to put in
the tables of thy.x. commandments / and Ian unclean creature should I presume
to receive the: which has made all laws and all creatures. Solomon the
prudent king was.vii. years i^ making a precious temple for to honor and
worship the there / and there did offer thousands of offrynges / and I a poor
sinner how shall I be so bold as to receive the in my soul / which has not
occupied my self devoutly one hour of this day. O good lord what great
dylygence have they given in the old testament for to please the / and how
little have I trauayled and busyed me to receive the worthily. There is great
dyffere^ce between the tabernacle of Moses with the relyques / and thy blyssed
body. If they have showed such devotion before the arche or tabernacle of the
testament / much more should I prepare my self to receive the blyssed body of
our lord Ihesu christ in the holy sacrament. O father of heaven albeit that I
should be a thousand years in preparynge my self / and that I should have the
holiness of all saints: the charity of all au^gelles and archau^gelles / the
desire of all just pernes / yet nevertheless I knowledge my self unworthy to
receive thy only sone Ihesu christ in the holy sacrament. O man this thou
shall understand after the dygnyte of the holy sacrament / for there is no
person ne creature in heaven so holy / nor in earth so just that might worthily
receive it. But thou shall understand and know for to comfort the / that
when the man does prepare him self to it by true co^trycyon and confession
that god does not regard what he is or has been / but only does se and
regard if he would be better tha^ he is / for god does than forget all his
sins / and does molyfye him self by the holy sacrament. And therefore the man
shall prove and search his conscience in these three points.

First / if his conscience does move and prycke him in any of the deedly
sins.

Secondaryly / if his will be united and joined to the will of god / so that all
thing do please him which does please god / and that all thing do dysplease
him / which does dysplease god.

Thyrdly / if the man do find in him self that charity and the love of god is
augmented by the holy sacrament / and that the fere of god is not dymynysshed.
In these points the man shall examyne him self. And if he find that by often
times going to the holy sacrament / the love of god is not fervent and quycke
in him: and the fere of god is dymynysshed / than by humylyte he shall refrain
and shall not go so often. For the life of one man is the death of another / but
if he find that the love of god is more fervent and quycke in him by reason of
the same / and that the fere of god does increase rather than dymynysshe / he
shall often times go to the holy sacrament after the counceyll of a good
co^fessoure and ghostly father. For the desire of god is / that he may dwell
in the heart of man: and by the same habytacyon or presence of the holy
sacrament / the man does draw him self from transytory things / and does
delight in heavenly things. Also by his holy body / ours is renewed / and with
it is united and joined: so that all thing is our which belongs unto him /
so that his heart and ours is all one: our body is his our wits be his / our
power / and all our members be united with god by the holy sacrament. Wherefore
he does speak by the prophet David. I have spoken: O men ye be gods and all
together children of heaven / For the soul of man is so united with god by the
holy sacrament: that all the au^gelles Cherubyns ne Seraphyns can not find any
dyfference between the^ two: for where they do move the soul / thither also
they do move god. There was never thing so united as god is with the soul of
man / for he is nerer and more united / than the soul and the body / which do
man a man. This we may consydre by many saints and perfyte men which have
suffered great pains / punysshementes / and tourme^tes of tyrauntes unto death /
that their bodies did depart from their souls. Yet these tyrauntes could
never separate god from their souls with all their tourme^tes. This union is
greater than if a drop of water were put in to a great tonne full of wine /
the which drop of water shall be incontinent converted in to wine. And
therefore man if thou will proceed from virtue to virtue / from grace to grace
/ from charity to charity / from desire in to desire / from the light of grace
to the light of glory / and to come to the perfeccyon of good works / exercise
thy self in the passion of our lord / and go often times true ten^ly and
worthily to the holy sacrament. For there is nothing that does quycken the
wits so much / nor that does illumynate the heart with devotion / nor that
does lift up the man so much to high contemplacyon / as to receive the body
of our lord / and remember his passion. O man if thou wylt also be perfytly
pourged from sin / enryched in virtues / hyghly illumynate in the holy
scripture / boldly vaynquysshe thine enemies / be comforted in all pains and
trybulacyons / live devoutly in earth / fervently be enbrased in thy heart / to
weep swetely in thy prayers / often times to be illumynate / in thy desires to be
ferme and steadfast / to contynewe in good operacyons / to be remplysshed and
fulfilled with spyrytuall joys / to be drawn to heavenly things / to know
that thing that god has hid and kept dark / to dye wisely / and to live
euerlastyngly with god / exercise thy self here in earth with god in the holy
sacrament and his bitter passion. For the man might with such and so great
medytacyon / desire / and with such love and devotion receive the holy
sacrament that from the lowest trone of aungelles he should be set i^ the
highest. For god does not promise nor also reward the man in heaven / after the
multitude of his good works / but also after the greatness of his desire and
love. Therefore many do err which do withdraw them self from the holy
sacrament saying. I word very often times go to receive the holy sacrament /
but I have no spyrytuall richesse in me / that is to say virtues wherewith
honestly and compete^tly I may aorne my soul for to receive the great king
being present in the sacrament The other do say / I have not in me the water
of tears for to cleanse and wasshe my conscience from all fylth and sin.
Other do say / I have no fervent devotion i^ my prayers / but I am cold /
feeble / and slothful toward god. And so they will tarry unto they be rich
in virtues: and that they have abundaunce of tears and fervent devotion: as
they were assured thereby to receive god worthily i^ the holy sacrament. O poor
man: there be many Turks / Sarazyns / and Infydelles / which have done many
virtuous deeds and have great devotion in their sacryfyce / yet nevertheless
they do consyste and be in dampnacyon of their souls. It is not that that god
does search. Our lord Ihesu christ does desire and demand of us: that we
after our poor power prepare our self by true confession / repentance / and
contrycyon and ferme purpose never to return more to syn^e. In this we do
prepare our self. And if our lord god give us this grace / than we shall
turn us to devotion and to the tears of our iyes. And if we can not do it /
we shall commit it to god: and shall not therefore leave and refrain to go to the
holy sacrament / specially if thy heart greatly desire it. That such people do
err / I will show you by three reasons.

First / it should be great folly and madness for a poor man being clothed in
rich and precious apparel / to demand and beg of a rich king / but it
should be better that he should come like a poor man showynge his poverty and
so demanding richesse. So do the poor people that do sytte at the church
doors / showynge to the rich men their nakedness and poverty: and thereby the
rich people be moved with pytie. So also shall we do: showyng our nakedness of
virtues / how feeble so ever we be / how cold and flow in devotion / how
indyscryte in words inclyned to all syn^e. These faults and other like
showynge to god the rich king of Jerusalem / he will aid and help us in our
poverty with the treasoure of his dyuyne grace / and shall have mercy of us in
likewise as he did to the woman of Canane / the which humbly did demand and
desire to eat with the fytell dogs the crommes and little peaces of bread /
that did fall from the table. And because that she did not repute her self
worthy to receive a great grace / god did grant her that / that she did
demand / ye and if she had desired a greater thing. And this is that /
whereof he does speak by the prophet David The poor shall eat and shall be
filled / and those that do search god shall praise and laud him / and their
heart shall live with god euerlastyngly. In this ye may consydre two things.

First / god is the meat of the poor / in the soul.

Secondaryly / that they shall eat unto they be full. And because that that is
impossyble so long as we be here in earth / unto yt we come to heaven where we
shall be filled Therefore all devout persons shall dyspose themself for to go
often times to the holy sacrament. For as saint Gregorye faith / there is great
dyffere^ce between spyrytuall meat and carnal meat. For the man may take so
much of carnal meat or joy / that he shall be weary therewith. But of
spyrytuall meat or joy / the man can not take so much that he will be weary
therewith / for the more that he does take thereof / the more he does demand
and desire. And of this it is spoken in Ecclesiastico: saying. Those that do
eat me shall have hungre. Wherefore he that will go to receive the Sacrament
worthily / he shall do that is in him / and than he shall commit him self to
god / which will fulfill that that does lack in the man. The other do compain
and say / that they have not the water of tears for to wasshe their
co^scye^ce / for the which thing they do refrain to go to the holy sacrament /
in depreuynge their soul from much fruit. These persons do like foles /
which will not go to the fountain for to have water / but with their pottes
full. And should it not be more profitable to go to the fountain with emptye
vessels / and to take of the water so much as shall suffyse them. This
fountain is our lord Ihesu christ hyd in the holy sacrament / and ready with
his dyuyne grace / to give abundauntly to all persons / as he did speak to the
woman standing at the well. He that does drink of that water yt I will give
him he shall never have thirste / but in him shall spryng and come forth a
living fountain in the everlasting life. And therefore he that has no thing
nor no thing can get of the water of tears in his vessel / he shall go
surely without doubt or fere with a ferme faith and believe / to the
abundau^tly lyuyngly well the which is open to all persons / that is to say
/ the holy sacrament. And thereof thou shall draw and take abundauntly / so
much as thou shall need / and shall suffyse the / for if the fountain be to
deep / bind thy vessel to the wood of the cross remembryng his bitter
passion / and thou shall fill thy vessel abu^dauntly with the water of tears.
And therefore it is yt our lord Ihesu christ has given him self in the holy
sacrament / because that he knows well that man is faultye and inclyned to all
feebleness. If we should have been as perfyte as the aungelles in heaven / it
should not have been needful that our lord god should have given him self in
the holy sacrament for our syckenes and feebleness. Therefore man shall do that
that is in him and shall reco^mende him to the mercy of god / For so have all
the holy men done / which be saved by the same.

There be other that do complain saying that they be not fervent nor hot in
the love of god / and that their hertes be not inflamed in the charity or love
of god / but they be cold. And therefore they will not go to the table of god
to receive the holy sacrament These persons do like foles / as those that be
very cold and will not go to the fire to warm them. It were better for them
to go to the fire / than to tarry long from it / and to suffer i^ the mean
time great cold. This fire is Ihesu christ hid in the holy sacrament / as
the Prophet says / Our god is fire which deuoureth / the which fire is god
come and descended in earth / for to illumynate our hertes by all the benefytes
that he has done unto us. Devotion does not consyste in much fasting /
prayenge / and often times confessing / but it does consyste in that that the
man be humble of heart / fervent / turned toward god / illumynate with
dyuyne charity / merciful toward his neighbor and even christen having god
always before his iyes. For it is more acceptable unto god / that the man after
that he has sinned / turn him self humbly toward god / than if he had
never sinned and should not be humble. Therefore all those yt be cold and feeble
in the love and charity of god / shall somtymes prepare themself for to go
worthily to the holy sacrament / for to be so and in such manner holy
illumynate with the love of god / without the which al our good works (as
saint Paul says) be no thing acceptable of god. I do not say that I will
counceyll al persons to go often times to the holy sacrament / But I say as
saint Austyne says / I do not laud and praise for to go euerydaye to the holy
sacrament / nor also do not dysprayse it / but I give counceyll to receive it
every sunday. This does saint Austyne speak of those / whose conscience is
not known / whereupon the gloss does say / that if the good men go often times
to the holy sacrament it is to be praised when they be in good life / flyenge
sin and the occasyon thereof / taking also good head to them self and
always occupyenge them self in the passion of our lord. These folks thus
living and not after the sensualyte of the flesh: be greatly to be praised /
that they go so often times to the holy sacrament. And because that the
conscience of man is hyd and not known whether it be worthy to receive god or
no / therefore the holy doctors do counceyll that every man do after his believe
and faith / that is to say after his conscience / and the love that he has
toward the holy sacrament. For after the love that the man has toward the
holy sacrament / he does perceive and feel devotion and swetnes in his soul /
and the man does more honor to god in devoutly going to the holy sacrament /
than if he should refrain by and through humylyte. For the man going devoutly
to the sacrament / he does convert and turn him self to the dyuyne love and
charity / and in refraynyng he does turn him to humylyte: and because that
charity and love do pass all other virtues / so it is better to go with love
to the holy sacrament / than to refrain by humylyte. For he that is not let
by sin and might well prepare him self to the same and does it not / he
does depryue (in as much as in him is) the holy trynyte from his honor /
the au^gelles from their glory / the holy church from his treasoure / the just
men from many graces / the sinners from pytie and mercy / and the souls in
purgatory from delyueraunce of the pain. Yet not withsta^dynge it is good
that the man somtymes withdraw him self through humylyte from the holy
sacrament / in not going to the table of our lord. For it was as acceptable to
god / that Centurio that noble knight did knowledge him self by humylyte to be
unworthy to receive him in his house / as Zacheus that rich man which
worthily did receive him. This neuetheles shall not be often times to be done /
specially when the man does find him self i^maculate and without sin. For
the holy sacrament is a medicyne of the soul against syx dyseases wherewith the
soul is charged. First / the man is feeble and has small courage in virtue /
and is not so virtuous ne does not so many virtuous deeds / as he is bound to
do. Wherefore god has made him self little and small in the holy sacrament /
to the intent that no man be afraid of his might and power / the which we
may consydre in two manners and sorts.

First / it seems that god is lesser than the man / for he does apply and
give his will to the will of the man: so that he does desce^de from heaven to
the earth upon the altar / when it pleases the man / that is to say the
priest. And does suffer him self to be used as well of his enemies as of his
friends / and does show no manner of evil nor aduersytye. And so it seems
outwardely that the man is greater than god / for god is obedyent to the man.

Seco^daryly / we may consydre the smalnes or lytelnes of god in the holy
sacrament For he does give him self so freely to the man / that he may do
with him what he will. He does suffer the man to use and receive him as he will
/ to the intent that every man which is little and poor of virtues: should
receive great richesse in his soul.

The second reason: the man is feeble and ready to sin. Therefore our lord
Ihesu christ has given him self in the sacrament to the intent that the man
thereby should vaynquysshe all te^ptacyons and inclynacyons to sin / For the
multitude of our sins toward the power of the holy sacrament is not / but
as a drop of water toward the hole see. So we may always by the holy
sacrament / make satysfaccyon for our sins. Therefore saint Ambrose says /
so often as the man receives the holy sacrament so often receives he remyssyon
of his sins. And for so much as man is always ready to sin / therefore he
shall have always with him the medycyne of his soul / for the man can not
better reconcyle him self to god / than by the holy sacrament. Therefore those
that do not go to the holy sacrament / do show yt they do not desire grace ne
mercy of god: thinking to come to heaven with out god. Notwithstanding the
nerest way to come to heaven / is by the holy sacrament. Therefore the prophet
David says: assaye and prove how sweet our lord god is.

Thyrdly / the man is enuyroned and among his enemies / as the devil / the
flesh / and the world. Wherefore the man lives always with fere and dread /
and is never in surety. And to the intent that the man do not fere being in
this great myserie and peril / and that his enemies do not vaynquysshe him nor
wound him to death / therefore god has given him self in the holy sacrament as
a faithful fellow and co^paygnon which styfly will tarry with him and not
depart / unto he have vaynquysshed all his enemies / the which thing god did
promise to his dyscyples in the last supper: and to all men that do receive him
saying / I will be with you / unto the end and consummacyon of the world.
This good compaygnon defends / techeth / and does solycyts the man in all
thing that he has to do and that is necessary for him / and does keep and take heed of the man / in all pain / te^ptacyon / trybulacyon / in poverty of
spyryte / and in all busynes that may chance unto him. Therefore the man shall
call and demand the coming of this co^paygnon / for he does make the
slothful person quycke / and that thing that is heavy light / eygre and bitter
sweet. And he does make rich those that be poor: and those that be desolate
and in heaviness / he does rejoice and conforte them. For saint Paul says / I
may in him which does coroborate me / do all thing / that is to say in the
holy sacrament the man may find in company many sweet joys / ye if the man
would search he should find all that he would / as vyctorye in te^ptacyon /
joy in trybulacyon / in syckenes pacyence / in persecucyon pleasure. Therefore
David says / I will not fere what soever man shall do to me for god is with
me. Fourthly / a good man fereth god for his time lost / the which he has
consumed in syn^e without doing any virtuous deeds few or none. In this may
be co^sydered the great displeasure of the man: which is much to be complained
/ and that for two reasons. The first / that so long as the man is in deedly
sin / so long is he in the maledyccyon of god / and is eueryday more than a
hondreth times cursed of the good persons saying their hours / by the
prophet David in the psalter / where it is written. O good lord cursed be
those which do not observe and keep thy commandments.

Secondaryly / so long as the man is in deedly sin / he does lease all his
good works that he does and has done: And if he dye in any deedly sin / all
is lost. O good lord / how few people do remember that. O man remember that
if temporal goods and richesse be lost / there is no thing lost / but if the
soul be lost / all is lost: if honor be lost / much is lost: but if the
soul be lost all is lost. And to the intent that the man do not contynewe in
this myserye and that he do not fall in dyspayre: the most benygne Ihesus has
given him self in the sacrament / to the intent that all those which before
were cursed / by him again may be blyssed / and whose works were deed / by
him should reuyue. That is to say the good works which ones were in life /
which now reuyue. And so the man does repare and recover by the holy
sacrament / all his time lost. And in receyuynge the holy sacrament the man
does a great work / so that he can do no thing better / in case that he
receive it as it aperteyneth after the ordinance of the holy church / for
thereby the myserye of the man is amended.

Fyfthly / the man is very poor of virtues / so yt he can do no good thing of
him self. Therefore god has given him self in the sacrament for consolacyon
and comfort / as a merchant with all the treasoure and richesse of his grace
and mercy / so that the man may surely of him demand and ask what soever he
will / and god will give it him by and in the holy sacrament / to the intent
that the man may so satysfye his poverty. Whereof Solomon speaks saying / He
is come as a ship of a merchant / the which brought his bread from a far
country. This merchant is the dyuynyte: the ship is the humanyte / the which
has brought the dyuynyte from a far country / as from heaven in to the sea of
this world. The bread which he has brought in this ship: is the holy
sacrament / as he says of him self. I am the living bread descended and come
from heaven. This bread is so abundaunt and so fertyll in it self / that it is
suffycye^t for all those that demands it and loves it. Therefore god says
in the gospel: all my goods be the goods of the man / for all that I have
apperteyneth to the man. O good lord what thou art lyberall / large and
merciful / that all thy goods which so rychely thou only do possede:
will spend with the man saying / all my good and richesse of grace and glory
/ apperteyneth to the. O good lord what small gift thou receyuest of me for
that that thou gyuest me in the holy sacrament: god maker of all creatures for
one creature / a man i^nocent for a man being a sinner / a noble holy soul
for a perverse and unnoble. Wherefore I speak with the prophet David. O good
lord what shall I give and render to the for that thou have given me. I will
take the chalyce of health / and I will inuoke and call the name of our lord.
All those that be poor of virtues in the soul / they shall go surely without
any fere to the holy sacrament as to a rich merchant which shall fulfill all
thy demau^des and desires of his lyberalyte: without gyuynge gold or silver.

Syxtly / the man is to far from his end of perpetual health / to the which
he was made and fourmed in this world / so that of him self he can not come
thereto. Nevertheless to the intent that the man do not dyspayre for to come
thither / god has given him self in a spyrytuall meat / in and by the which
the man is saved and united: as he does speak him self in the gospel / He yt
does eat my flesh and drynketh my blood he abides in me and I in him. And
if it be not that thou eat the flesh of the sone of the man and drink his
blood / thou shall never have life in the / that is to say in thy soul here in
earth and hereafter in heaven. Therefore speaks saint Austyne in the person of
god saying. When thou do eat me / I shall not be converted in the / but
thou in me. For this union the sone of god did pray to his father saying. O
father save in thy name al those that thou have given me: so that they may be
one with us as we together be one / I in the and thou in me. O most benygne
Ihesu thou have showed in this thy infynyte mercy / for by this meat we do
join and make us one in the / to the and with the. But many does receive the
holy sacrament with little desire and in great feebleness. It is greatly to be
complained / that so many folks have so little devotion toward the holy
sacrament / so that for a light occasyon they do not go thereto: to the which
they should well and dylygently always prepare them. But because that they be
loath to confess them / and that it greueth them to fast / they do let it pass
/ the which is a token of little love that they have toward god. For as
saint Gregorye says / the dyleccyon and love of god is never Idle and void in
the man / For where it is there it works great things / and where it is not
there the man is Idle. O if there were but one man in the world worthy to
receive the holy sacrament / how would all the other re^ne to se him and to
speak with him. Now our lord Ihesu christ gives and makes him self common
egally to all persons / wherefore many there be that do not regard him. And
therefore when they dye / they find them self naked of virtues in the soul /
and chased from everlasting life / the which all those only that do eat of
this bread shall use and have / for they shall live euerlastyngly. Amen.

The first Chapter / what thing is necessary for the man that will receive
worthily the holy sacrament.
AS the doctors do write / three things be necessary to every good person yt
fructefully will receive the blyssed sacrament of our lord Ihesu christ. The
first that is necessary for the man / is pureness and clennes in the conseyence
/ so that he be without deedly sin / in true repentance / confession / and
steadfast purpose never to sin more / and to fulfill the commandments of
god and those of the holy church. For the holy church does prohybyte and
forbid / that all those that be in deedly sin / that they shall not receive
the holy sacrament / if they be not first and before confessed and assoyled.
For otherwise in going to the sacrament they sin deedly: in case that they
may have or find a confessoure. Therefore the man shall prepare him thereunto:
as if incontinent after his confession he should dye / and that is suffycyent
before Ihesu christ.

The second is / that the man shall have fervent devotion / so that he shall
appoynte and prepare him self as devoutly as he can possible / tournynge him
self holy from that thing which for that time and hour might draw him
from god and from his devotion. Therefore the man shall have after his
confession before that he go to the sacrament / a general repentance and
contrycyon of all his venyall sins / specially of those wherein he knows him
self daily to fall / be it in vain speaking / in eating and drynkyng more
than need requires or in not having pacyence in trybulacyon or any other like
/ for they do let the person in his devotion. A man may get devotion in two
manners / that is to say by the fere of god / as in remembrynge the greatness
and multitude of his sins / and the justice of god. Secondaryly / by the
dyleccyon and love of god in remembryng his passion and the benefytes that he
has showed us.

The third thing that is necessary for man for to receive the holy sacrament
worthily / is clennes of the body outwardly / so that he be not poluted and
maculate in the body with sin by the defaulte of nature / the which may be
done in deedly sin / That is to say when it comes of carnal thoughts /
or when it comes of glotonye and excess of meats and drynkes. And than it
is good for him to refrain for the dygnyte of the sacrament. It may be done
also without sin / as by feebleness or debylyte of nature / by coldness of the
body / by te^ptacyon of the devil or otherwise. But he that shall find him
self grieved herein: shall take the counceyll of his confessoure.

The second Chapter / how the man goth in three manners of ways to the holy
sacrament in deedly sin.
THe man may be in deedly syn^e and yet receive the holy sacrament in three
manners.

First / he may be in deedly sin and know it not / or he does trust in
god that it is forgyuen him / for he does not remember it. To this the doctors
answer saying / if it be so that the man before his confession have examyned
his conscience after his power / and according to the prolyxyte of the time
that he was last confessed. And than he does search for a good confessoure /
that can help and examyne him in that wherein he is ygnorau^t. Who that so goth
to the holy sacrament with repentance and contrycyon of his sins: receives
in the holy sacrament remyssyon of all his sins / confessed and forgoten. But
if he do run neclygently to confess him / as the dog to the potage /
without remembrynge his evil life / it shall not help nor profit him before
god / that he has forgoten his sins. For it seems that he cares not for it
/ and that he does despise it.

Secondaryly / the man may doubt in deedly sin for the erraunt and varyable
conscye^ce / so that he makes conscience where it needs not / whereof comes
often times great peril. For the varyable conscience byndeth the man to elect
a good sage and wise confessoure / which has knowledge and understanding
thereof / and so he shall take away from him the varyable conscience or the
error of the same. And than he shall go to the holy sacrament: but so long
as that error of conscience dureth or the most part / he shall not go to the
sacrament. But if the man doubt if it be deedly syn^e or no / he shall
confess him before that he go to the holy sacrament / or else he shall commit a
deedly sin / in puttyng him i^ the peril of deedly sin.

Thyrdly / the man may yet be in deedly sin / and that he knows well that
he has not confessed him thereof. And nevertheless he should have confessed him
thereof / where he co^mytteth a deedly sin because he does not know it / for
he is bound to know it. And in so going to the holy sacrament it is deedly
sin and the ygnorau^ce does not excuse before god / for he might go / where he
might be instructed.

The third Chapter / if the man may go unworthily to the holy sacrament / or
be dampened for certain deedly sins which he has forgoten: and that he
knows not.
Upon this answers / saint Bonauenture that i^ case that the man have five
points in him / god shall not count his sins forgoten / albeit that there
were many.

First / he shall advise him self well before that he go to his confessoure /
in examynyng his conscience in the.x. commandments / and in the.vii. deedly
sins / and afterward in his state / office or craft.

Secondaryly / he shall pray to god dylygently that he may have knowledge of
his sins forgoten / of the which he is ready to confess him and to do
penance for the same after the counceyll of his confessoure.

Thyrdly / he shall gladly go to the Sermons for to here and learn / what
thing is deedly sin and what is not.

Fourthly / he shall take counceyll with his confessoure / and shall demand
that wherein he doubts / whether it be deedly sin or venyall. For many
folks do make no sin of that that is sin / thinking so to begyle their
confessors / the which nevertheless shall be reputed great sin before god.

Fyfthly / the man shall keep him in as much as he can and may from deedly
syn^e for those that sin an hondreth times and esteem it no more tha^ if they
did it not but.x. or.xx. times / it is no marvel if they do forget much /
the which our lord god will judge at the day of judgment.

The fourth Chapter / whereby the man may trust that he receives the holy
sacrament worthily / and who is in the state of grace.
Saint Thomas says / that no man so long as he lives here i^ earth may know
certainly if he be in the state of grace / and if he receive worthily the holy
sacrament or no / except that god do manifest and show it unto him. For saint
Paul speaks of him self / I do not knowledge me to be culpable in any deedly
sin / yet notwithstanding I am not iustyfyed before our lord god: which
knows all the hertes. Nevertheless after that the man has confessed him self
before his confessoure / and has dylygently declared all his sins. There be
yet four tokens / by the which he may surely trust and also have knowledge /
that he is well confessed and that he is in the state of grace / and so goth
worthily to the holy sacrament.

The first / if the man after his confession / gladly does here the word of
god and to speak of god. For our lord says / he that is of god / gladly does
here to speak of god. The second is / so long as the man feleth him self
ready to dwell and to serve god / it is a token that he is in the love of god:
for where the charity and love of god is / there it does work some good / and
if it can not do it by works / it does it by desire. And as saint Gregorye
says / the token of love is the showynge of the works.

The third is / that the man ought to have a steadfast purpose / from hensforth
never to sin more. For so long as the man is in the mind and will to sin
/ so long is he in the state of dampnacyon.

The fourth is / that the man ought to have great repentance and contrycyon of
his sins passed. Therefore the man shall not rejoice nor vaunte him self /
nor also shall not rehearse his sins: for by having pleasure and delight in
any deedly sin / a man may commit another deedly sin of new / and is
great peril and danger to the soul. In these four points (as saint
Gregorye says) does consyste true and perfyte penance.

The fyfth Chapter / if the man be bound in and for any cause / to confess
him more than ones in the year.
YT is commanded in the Canon law / that all good and catholyke persons
which be come to their aege (certain great necessyties except) at the least /
ones in the year do confess them and do receive the holy sacrament / or else
he that does it not / he shall be exco^munycate in his life / and after his
death he shall be buried in the feldes like a be. Yet notwithsta^dynge
doctors do say / that the man is bound under the pain of a deedly sin /
to confess him in contynent and not to tarry to Easter / and that for four
reasons and causes.

First / so often as the man is in peril of his life: as women before that they
begin to travail and labor of their child / or those that will interpryse
any great journey or to go over the sea: or those that do go to the war for
to fight / or those that do undertake any thing / whereof many do dye / or
those that be in peril to dye / as in the time of pestylence.

Secondaryly / those that have commit such sins that common confessors can
not assoyle them / or he that may assoyle them / does come thither where they
be: or they may lightly go unto him where he is: as to pardons and such other
/ that they be bound to confess them.

Thyrdly / when the conscience is very unquiet and does move a man fervently to
confess inco^tynently his sins / for the conscience bears wytnes how the
man is dysposed within.

Fourthly / when the man will receive the holy sacrament or any of the.vii.
sacraments. In these four causes is the man bound more than ones in the year
to confess his sins. Yet all this notwithstanding every good catholyke
person shall confess him self at the least four times in the year: albeit
that he be not ready to go to the holy sacrament so often. For a vessel that is
used and occupied every day and not made clean but ones in the year / it will
be so foul and fylthy at the last that he can not be made clean so it is also
of the conscience of man.

The.vi. Chapter / how and in what the man shall search and examyne him self
/ that worthily will go to the holy sacrament.
A Man that worthily will go to the holy sacrament he shall examyne dylygently
his co^scye^ce / in like case as he wol decyue and make a compte to a great
lord of many dettes. And to the intent that every man which can not well
confess him self may know the manner how to confess him / I will write a
common and a short manner / wherein al common sins be enclosed / in leuynge
that which apperteyneth not to be written / to the intent that some do not
learn that which they know not. And by this the man may learn to confess him
/ in adding and taking away as his state and occupacyon does require / or
also after as his conscience does testyfye and move him: for it should not
profit nor be possible to write all manner of sins. Therefore the man shall
provide him of a good confessoure in co^tynuynge with him without rennynge from
one to another / the which shall know his state and life / to the intent that
he may the better help him in that that he shall have forgoten and be
ygnoraunt. And thou shall come in time to confession / so that thou be not last
/ and that thou may have space enough to confess the / And when thou do
confess the a day before / and thou do remember in the mean time any
venyall sins / it shall not need to go again to confession / but to knock
upon thy breast with co^trycyon saying. O good lord have mercy of me poor
sinner. And keep the in as much as thou can from vain words / and carnal
thoughts and freque^tacyons / and from brekyng thy pacyence one day after thou
have received the sacrament / and one day before / for the dygnyte of the same.

The.vii. Chapter / how the man shall confess him self / first of the.xii.
Artycles of the holy catholyke faith.
When thou shall come to thy confession / knele down of both thy knees before
thy confessoure / making a cross before the and say / In the name of the
father / of the sone / and of the holy ghost. Amen. or In nomine patris. etc.
And than say Confiteor if thou can say it unto Ideo precor. And if thou can
not say it / say Benedicite: and than say / Sir I confess me before god and
you of all my sins that I have done / sith the first time that I could sin
unto this hour. First that I have sinned against the.xii. artycles of the
holy faith: that I have not so steadfastly byleued in heart / mouth / and
works as I am bound. I have somtymes also doubted in the holy sacrament or
otherwise as thou shall know thy self gyltye. If thou haste kept company
with Jews / Sarazyns / Heretykes / or if thou know any other thing / thou
shall tell it.

The.viii. Chapter / of the.xii. virtues of the holy ghost / whereof thou
shall confess the / as here follows.
I Confess and accuse me / that I have been neclygent and have transgressed i^
the.xii. virtues of the holy ghost / I have not had joy / gladness / and love
in the service of god / nor peace with my christen brother: nor pacyence in
aduersyte / nor longanymyte or contynuau^ce in the service of god / nor holiness
in my life / nor pytie in being co^uersaunt with other folks / nor also
measure and sobrenes in my manners / mine apparel / and in my works / nor
mekenes and Ientylnes with them that I have hau^ted and daily kept company /
nor humylyte in my thoughts and deeds / nor truth in my words: nor pureness
in my desires and concupyscence.

The.ix. Chapter of the.xi. capytall sins / which be called crymynall.
I Do confess and accuse me: that I have sinned in many of the crymynall or
capytall sins. If thou find thy self culpable any wise in any of the same
thou may tell it.

As to syn against the faith of the trinite

To sin against nature.

To sin in manslaughter.

To sin against the equity and justice of the mageste of any prince or
prelate.

To sin i^ robbynge the churches by force

To sin in carnal medlyng with any of his lynage.

To sin in adultery in the state of marriage.

To sin in conspyracye or in making tumoure by force among the co^monaltie.

To sin in berynge false wytnes and that he does know it false.

To sin in Symonye.

To sin by hauntynge vserye.

The.x. Chapter / of the.x. commandments / the which every person is
bound to know.
YEt I confess and accuse me of the.x. commandments of our lord Ihesu
christ.

Of the first commandment: yt I have not loved our lord god with all my heart
above all things I have not also worshypped him as I ought to do / nor I have
not had so steadfast faith in him as I am bound / but so^tymes I have byleued
those which have used Nygromancye / or wytche craft / or Herytykes which have
spoken against the holy church.

Of the second commandment / that I have taken the name of god in vain with
out any necessytie / for I have sworn often times for a little cause / which I
have known to be contrary / wherewith I have often times deceived mine even
christen. I ha^ also caused other to swear and curse / because that I would not
believe them of their word. I have also sworn not only by god and hy his
blyssed members and passion / but also by his saints / as by the mother of god
/ by saint Johan / and in other manners.

Of the third commandment / that I have not sanctyfyed the sunday and holy
day / by true contrycyon of my deedly sins / by my prayers / by herynge
mass and the sermon / and by gyuynge almous / but I have in this time serched
my profit in demanding money of my dettours / byenge and selling that that
was not greatly necessary. I have suffered my servants to labor without
necessytie / so that they could not here mass. I have occupied my self that
same day more than in other days / with wordly pleasure: as in eating /
drinking and in carnal frequentacyon.

Of the fourth commandment / that I have not honored my father and mother:
nor have not obeyed them / nor helped them in their necessytie / but I have
vexed and dyspleased them: and have wysshed them deed in my heart. I have not
also after their death faithfully prayed / nor caused to pray for their souls.
I have not also ben obedyent to my spyrytuall prelates and ancient fathers and
to them / and to the holy church I have not borne honor and showed reverence
as I am bound. I have not parfytely paid my offrynges and dewtyes of the holy
church. I have spoken and kept company with those that were excomunycate /
with usurers / herytykes and other Infydels.

Of the fyfth commandment / that I have slain and killed my christen brother
or neighbor by will and desire / albeit that in deed I have not fulfilled it
/ And that unjustly and against reason I have caused them to be imprisoned / or
I have done them hurt and do^mage in their bodies and goods. I have hurt /
wounded / or bette some / I have not kept well my children / so that they be
departed out of this world / baptized or not baptized.

Of the syxt commandment / that I have done unclean and unlawful works with
unlawful persons not married / or in adultery with persons married / or with
vyrgynes and maidens whom I have defloured and vyolate / or with my kynsfolkes
/ or gossep / or against nature / or with thy self / or if thou have give thy
faith secretly to any person without any wytnes or without the commandments
of the church / and so has carnally meddled before that thou was married.

Of the seventh commandment / that I have take and also by force without
right or reason the goods of other men out of holy places or not holy. And
that I have solycyte to have some offices or benefyces / whereby I have
oppressed the poor people / and have taken more than of right I ought to do. I
have commit vsurye secretly or openly I have sold my goods or marchaundyse
derer by credence than for ready money. I have received the goods of spyrytuall
persons / or of their servants / or of children / and those which can not
give any thing without license. I have not ben faithful in my labor and
work. I have praised often times my goods and marchaundyse much above the
price that they were worth: in puttyng the best above in sight. And the worste
beneth. I have also deceived folks with evil money. I have not restored the
goods which I have wrongfully come to or that thing that I have found. I
have evil and vnprofytably spent the goods of the church / or mine own
goods. And I have not fulfilled the testament or last will of my friends /
so as I ought to do / or so soon as I might.

Of the.viii. co^maundemet / that I have given by malice against my neighbor
false wytnes secretly or openly. And I have brought forth against him false
wytnes / or have brought or turned them by gifts or thretynges. I have not
said the treuth that I knew to the profit of my neighbor when it has been
demanded of me / I have also withdrawn the good name and fame of other
persons / in speaking evil of them behind their backs. And I have mocked /
shamed / and dyffamed them.

Of the.ix. commandment / that I have voluntaryly consented / desired and
solycyte to sin in Lechery with unlawful persons. And have had pleasure and
joy in my folysshe and unclean thoughts. I have also apparylled and aorned my
self in pride / for to be better seen and to please other persons / and for
to draw them in to syn^e at my desire / And I have gladly gone to such places
/ where I might se wanton and vycyous persons / or might be seen my self with
concupyscence / whereof I have had often times evil dremes / and defaulte or
polucyon of nature.

Of the.x. commandment / that I have desired in my heart against right and
reason to have another man's goods: ye if they should have suffered poverty
thereby / And have solycyte to obtain their goods by fraud. I have also
bought that / which I could not by without syn^e / as the goods of the
usurer / or that I did know well yt it was stolene / or I have also secretly
solycyte for to dyffame some person for to have his service or office. And
then say / of these deedly sins / and of all other that I have done against
the commandments of god / I confess me to be gyltye. And demand and
desire penance for the same.

The.xii. Chapter / of the.ix. strange sins: how a man shall confess him of
the same.
I Confess and knowledge my self gyltye of the.ix. strange sins / where as
I have offended my lord god in the same.

First / that I have commanded other persons to sin / as the father to
command his children / the master his servants / the maystres her maiden
or chambryer / which is syn^e against god and the love or profit of his
neighbor. And no man ought to do such a thing.

Secondaryly / that I have given to another evil counceyll / whereof is come
sin or do^mage: and whereby also other have been oppressed and shamed.

Thyrdly / that I have consented to do evil in mine offices for money or
reward which is sin / And albeit that I have not done it or commanded it /
yet nevertheless consentyngly I have let it pass without any head taking
thereof. Also of the evil chanced in my house among my children and
servants / if I had given contrary commandment or taken head thereunto / it
should not have chanced / or else it should have been amended.

Fourthly / that I have praised other in their sin and malice / and that I
have taken pleasure and reioysed my self to here them rehearse their sins /

other unlawful persons living in sin.

Syxtly / that I have been partener in yt thing that has been stolen / and

they have bette / wounded / mocked / and rygorously spoken to the same poor
folks and i^nocentes / so that they have cursed and sworn great oaths.

Nynthly / that I have not showed the malice of another man: to him that might
amend and correct it. Also that I have known some hyd which has been
stolen and that I have not showed it to him / to whom it apperteyneth. Also
that I have seen euydent peril of my neighbor both in soul / body and
goods / whereof I have not cou^ceylled and aduysed him after my power.

Seventhly / I have not had pacyence for to suffer aduersyties.

Eyghtly / I have not weped for my sins / nor had dew contrycyon for the
same.

The.xiii. Chapter / of the.vii. gifts of the holy ghost / and how a man
shall confess him of the same.
ALso I confess and knowledge my self gyltye / that I have not in me the.vii.
gifts of the holy ghost.

First I have not the wisdom for to understand that thing / which
apperteyneth unto god.

Secondaryly / I have not in me understanding for to remember the four
extremyties / as death / the pain of hell / the day of judgment / and the joy
of heaven.

Thyrdly / I have not in me wise and sage counceyll / for to fly and eschew
the evil and to chose the best.

The.xiiii. Chapter / how a man shall confess him self of the.vii.
sacraments / of the holy church.
I Confess and knowledge my self gyltye / yt I have not honored the.vii.
sacraments of the holy church / as I am bound.

First: albeit that I am baptized or chrystened / yet nevertheless I have not
renounced the devil and his works and pompes / as I promised at the baptysme.

Secondaryly / albeit that I am confyrmed / yet notwithsta^dynge I have not
spoken that thing that touches the holy catholyke faith / or I have let it
pass for worldly fere / and have been ashamed to speak.

Thyrdly / I have not honored ne observed the state of marriage.

Fourthly / I have not honored the priests and spyrytual persons / nor also
the ordres of the holy church for the love of god.

Fyfthly / I have not done the penance for my sins to me enjoined by my
confessoure / in prayenge / fasting / in almous deed and other like.

of my sins / and so perfytely spoken / as I ought to do.

Seventhly / I have not received the holy sacrament of the altar so worthily /
nor have beholden it with such reverence / as it apperteyneth.

The.xv. Chapter / how a man shall confess him of the.vii. deedly sins.
ALso I confess and knowledge my self gyltye / to have sinned in the.vii.
deedly sins.

Fyste in pride of heart in words / in thoughts and in works / for I have
auaunced and exalted my self / and have desired to be hard and seen of other.
I have also be proud and presu^ptuous in my words and deeds / and have had
vain glory in my heart. I have also presumed and bosted my self of my noblenes
and fayrenes / by reason whereof I have dyspraysed and despised the other which
had it not. I have not regarded the ordinances of the holy church / but
reputed them as no thing / in keeping company with those that were
exco^munycate. I have despised both those persons / that were not so high
indygnyte as I / and also those that were higher and better than I: and I have
hayted those that were like and as good as I. I have always wylled and desired
to have my will fulfilled / and have always wylled to have right and reason /
in excusing me and accusynge another. I have also ben unkind both to god and
man / for the goods and benefytes that I have received of them.

Secondaryly / I do confess and accuse me of the sin of coueytous / for
inordynately and above reason and mine estate / I have desired and coueyted
richesse and honor. I have withholden other men's goods / using them at my
pleasure. I have hid and withdrawn my self / to the intent that I should
not give almous to the poor and indygent / where as nevertheless great
necessytie was. I have haunted and played at cards and dyse for coueytous on
the sunday and holy days. I have also for money lied for to get honor and
benefyces. And have written false letters / used vsurye. I have also deceived /
stolen and robbed / bette / sworn / and given false and evil judgment.

Thyrdly / I knowledge my self gyltye in lechery / by thought / word / and
deed / by my self / or with unlawful persons / in hau^tynge / clyppynge and
kissing unhonestly / or I have i^ the state of marriage dysordynately above
reason and nature lived for albeit that I have not commit adulterye in deed /
yet nevertheless I have consented thereunto in my heart.

Nota / Here thou shall take cou^ceyll brefly and honestly of thy ghostly
father / for a man may sin deedly with his wife in marriage / in five manners
and ways / the which it is no need to declare here.

Fourthly / I confess and knowledge me to have sinned in envy / for I have
hayted and has been enuyous for the honor / good name / and auau^cement of my
christen brother and neighbor. And by envy I have done the best that has been i^ me / to let him thereof. Also for envy I have be right sorry of his good
fortune / prosperyte / and auauncement / and have been very glad of his
mysfortune / trybulacyon / and aduersytie / troublynge and oppressynge him to
my power where soever I could. I have also dyffamed him behind his back: and
have gladly herkened and herd other which have spoken evil of him. And I have
also made dysce^cyon where there was peace and co^corde. Fyfthly / I have
sinned in glotonye / for I have not fasted and kept abstynence on fasting
days / vygyles / and other commanded by the holy church. I have also eaten
before the time and hour of the repase / and sometime without appetyte / more
for carnal voluptuousnes than for the necessytie and mayntenaunce of nature. I
have also taken meat and drink so abundauntly and excessyuely / that I have been sick and evil dysposed thereby / having lost reason / memory / and
understanding. I have caused over delycate and precious meats to be ordained
for me / wherein I have had great pleasure. I have also eaten meats not lawful
to be eaten on such a day / after the commandments of the holy church.

Syxtly I have sinned in ire and wrath for I have been often times vexed and
angry with my husband / or my wife / with my children or my menye and
servants. I have wylled through wrath to be venged / and have desired
vengeance. And I have borne in my heart the iniurye and wrong which has been
done unto me / and for ire and wrath / I have not ben willing to forgive him
that did it / nor to speak unto him / but rather I have eschewed his company.
I have also for anger and wrath / cursed and sworn abhomynably / and have done
all the hurt and do^mage that I could to my neighbor / both in his body and
goods. Also I have not ben willing to here reason nor to be content therewith
/ but have cried out against truth. I have made dyscorde and varyaunce / and
without right or reason have holden more with one than with another.

Seventhly / I confess me to have sinned in sloth / where as I have consumed
and lost much goods wherewith I was bound to do good deeds / and by my
conscience exorted thereto. I have been slothful in gods service / and to go
to confession / and to do my penance. I have not fulfilled my penance
enjoined to me by my co^fessoure: for my sins / nor promyses and vows by me
made / or else slouthfully I have fulfilled them. I have been Idle / and have
spent my time i^ vain. And I have somtymes done good deeds with little
devotion / by heaviness shame or vain glory. I have been also neclygent in
learning that thing that I was bound to know / in all these.vii. deedly
sins or in some of them: wherein I have offended my lord god / I knowledge my
self gylty / and cry god mercy.

The.xvi. Chapter / how a man shall confess him self / of the.vii. works

without reason

Seue^thly / I have not buried nor caused to burye the deed bodies.

The.xvii. Chapter / of the.vii. works of mercy spyrytually.
I knowledge me to have sinned in the.vii. spyrytuall works of mercy.

First / I have not taught and instruct those that were ignorant / that

Secondarylye / I have not given them good counceyll which demanded it of me
/ whereby they have been in great peril and danger both in body and soul.

Thyrdly / I have not reproved and correct them which have erred and sinned /
wherein I might have done great profit.

Fourthly / I have not corroborate and comfort them / which have been in
dyspayre.

Fyfthly / I have not ben wyllyng to forgive the^ / which have troubled and
vexed me. Syxtly / I have not pacye^tly borne nor suffered iniuryes / wrongs /
dyspysynges / te^ptacyons / syckenes / oppressyons or other aduersyties.

Seventhly / I have not hertely / affectuously / and faithful prayed for my
friends and for mine enemies / and for them that I am bound to pray.

The.xviii. Chapter / how the man may confess him of the syx sins which
be against the holy ghost.
I Confess me if I have any manner or wise sinned in the six sins against
the holy ghost.

First in dyspayre / yt I have not byleued through dyspayre that god is
merciful / and will pardon and forgive all sins: after repentance /
contrycyon / and confession.

Secondaryly / that I have wyllyngly spoken against the catholyke faith: and
have spoken against that which was for the health of my soul.

Thyrdly / I have been so hard of heart and so roted in sin / that I would
not be brought out of it.

Fourthly / that by presumpcyon I have not dred god nor death / nor the judgment
of god / but I have thought that I shall be saved without penance and good
works. Fyfthly: that I have been enuyous for the grace of god in another /
which did withdraw him self from sin / to good and virtuous living.

Syxtly / that I have despised to do penance for my sins.

The.xix. Chapter / how a man shall confess him of the five senses or wits
and of the other members of the body.
Moreover / I confess me to have sinned / and to have offended god in my.v.
wits and by all my members.

First / that I have trymmed and aorned the here of my heed and brows with
great pride. I have not honored nor showed reverence to god / and my
superyours with my heed / nor have not ben obedyent therewith. I have also given
mine ears to here dishonest words and co^munycacyon / and to detraccyon. I
have not ruled and kept mine iyes from the beholdynge of unlawful and
dyshonest syghtes I have delyted to smell with my nose such things as have
provoked me to sin. I have also opened my mouth / to curse / to swear / to
lie / and to deceive. I have also abused my tongue for to eat and drink
delycyously: and my throat in singing wanton and dishonest songs. I have also
abused my hands to my self or to other / in uncleanness and lechery. I have made
my god of my body / in abundaunce of eating and drynkyng / and uncleanness. I
have had many unlawful and unclean thoughts / and desires in my heart: the
which I would have done in deed / if shame of the world had not let me. I
have mysused my legs and fete in going to places / where as I have greatly
grieved god / whereof I am sorye / and I cry god mercy.

The.xx. Chapter / how the man shall confess him self of the four sins
cryenge vengeance before god.
I Confess me also if I have i^ any wise offended god / in the four sins
cryenge to god for vengeance.

First / in the sin against nature: that is to say / when it is done in
another place and in otherwise / than nature and god have ordained it.

Secondaryly / that I have shed innocent blood / or have brought any person to
death / without a cause.

Thyrdly / that I have oppressed and unreasonably persecuted poor orphelyns:
wydowes / and poor folks.

Fourthly / that I have withholden and not dewely paid those / which have
faith fully served and labored for me / as they have deserved.

The.xxi. Chapter / how the man shall confess him of the four cardynall
virtues.
I Have yet sinned i^ the four cardynall virtues / whereby I am bound to lead
and rule my life.

First: in me there is not wisdom and prudence to do and acco^plysshe my
acts and deeds in time conuenyent / as I am bound.

Secondaryly / I have not in me force and strength to resyste evil and peruers
inclynacyons and temptacyons to sin / but I have been lightly overcome / and
have fallen in to sin.

Thyrdly / I have not in me the virtue of temperau^ce and mean / for I have
trauayled / and labored / fasted / prayed / done penance / and other good
deeds without dyscrecyon / so that thereby I have to much feblysshed my body.

Fourthly / I have not in me the virtue of justice / for I have not turned my
self from sin / in not doing the virtue which I was bound to do / and for
mine own profit / I have forsaken to do the common profit.

The.xxii. Chapter / how a man shall confess him of the.iii. pryncypall
virtues / called Theologycall.
I Have syn^ed i^ the.iii. pryncypall virtues without the which I can not be
saved. First / that I have not in me / steadfast faith with good works.

Secondaryly / I have not a sure hope of the heavenly goodness for to come.

Thyrdly / I have not in me a fervent love and charity toward god and my
neighbor.

The.xxiii. Chapter / how a man shall confess him of the two commandments
/ in the which all the other be comprehend.
I Have sinned / because I have not loved my lord god and creatoure with all
my heart / my soul / and with all my might and power. I have often times set my
heart more in the love of folks / and in the honor and joy of this world /
in aorneme^tes and voluptuousnes of my body / and in the goods / richesse /
and other vanyties of this world / than toward god almyghtye.

Also I have not loved my christen brother and neighbor as my self / doing
otherwise to him / than I would had been done to me / whereof I am sorry and cry
god mercy.

The.xxiiii. Chapter / how a man shall confess him / of the cogytacyons and
thoughts of his heart.
I Do accuse me also / to have sinned greatly by cogytacyons and thoughts of
my heart.

First / that I have received of our lord god many good inspyracions:
sterynge and mouyng me to amend my peruers and evil life / and to turn me
to penance / and that I should do good and leave the evil. These and many
other exhortacions which I have received of god and of my holy angel I have
resyste and withstand / as an ingrate and unkind person.

Secondaryly / I have not resyste and with stand evil thoughts / which have
come unto me by temptacyon of the flesh or of the devil / but have
perseuered of a fre will and have thought of them by consent / if I might have
had my purpose: and have left it more for shame and fere of the people: tha^
for the love or fere of god. In these and many other sins venyall and mortal
/ I knowledge me to have often times offended my lord god in heart.

The.xxv. Chapter / how a man shall confess him self in general of all his
venyall sins.
I Have finally sinned and do accuse me of al my venyall sins / which be in
great nombre / as of vain thoughts / words / and deeds: and that I have
evil and vnprofytably spent and lost my time and that I might have done much
more good tha^ I have done. I have not also said my prayers and penance so
hertely and fervently as I ought to do / and that I have not so devoutly and
hertely made my confession. I have not praised and lauded almighty god in all
his operacyons and works. I have filled and nourysshed my body with eating
and drinking more than was need or necessary.

Of these sins and all other that I have done in my life / whether they be
mortal or venyall / which be in my remembrance and known / or forgoten and
not known by ygnorau^ce / were it waking or slepynge / by day or by night:
al one or with another / I confess me and knowledge me to have offend god /
cryenge him mercy / and desire absolucyon of you my ghostly father. Et Ideo
precor. etc.

The.xxvi. Chapter / what thing man receives / which worthily and in the
state of grace / goth to the holy sacrament.
WE have now herd / how and in what manner ye shall prepare your self by
confession for to go to the holy sacrament and rests to declare what virtues
and fruytes the man receives in his soul / which has so prepared him self.

First / the man receives in the holy sacrament / the same blyssed body and
flesh that our lady mary the mother of god has borne in her vyrgynall womb
/ and the which has hang upon the cross / by the which sacrament also the
man is made part taker of all the goodness that our lord has done in all his
life / in fasting / prayenge / prechynge / in watchynge / and in his hard and
bitter passion. Also the man thereby is made part taker of all the merytes of
all the saints in heaven: and of all the good persons in earth.

Secondaryly / the man receives in the holy sacrament / the holy precious and
blyssed blood of our lord Ihesu christ: and thereby is pourged of al his
sins confessed and forgoten. And after the greatness of his devotion / the
multitude of his sins be forgyuen him.

Thyrdly / the man receives in the holy sacrament / the noble soul of our
lord Ihesu christ / the which he did commend hanging on the cross / to
his father god almighty / whereby man pourchaseth a gayge of everlasting life.
For if god give to man the greatest thing / as his own propre soul: he will
give also that which is less / as the perdurable and everlasting life.

Fourthly / he receives also in the holy sacrament / the life united with the
body of our lord Ihesu christ / whereby the man is transfourmed in god. For as
puyssaunce or might is ascrybed to god the father / to the sone sapyence or
wisdom / and to the holy ghost pytie and benygnyte / so the man also by the
virtue of the holy sacrament / becomes mighty and strong in prayer / to
resyste the evil temptacyons of the devil of hell. He becomes also sage and
wise for to chose virtue and the good from the evil. He does pourchase also in
him self great goodness: as love and charity toward god / and pacyence and
humylyte.

Fyfthly / the man receives by the holy sacrament / the dyuynyte of our lord:
whereby the soul of the man is re^plysshed with the swetnes of dyuyne grace.
For the man which has worthily received the holy sacrament / albeit that the
bread or host is consumed and vanysshed / yet has he our lord Ihesu christ
abiding i^ his soul with his grace / as a spyrytual meat of the soul: and
so he receives the sacrament bodyly and ghostly. But if he receive it in
deedly syn^e: he receives it bodyly / as the very body of our lord / but he
does not receive the virtues aforesaid in his soul. For when the sacrament
is dygeste i^ the body of man / our lord god does return unto heaven from
whens he came by his grace / leuyng the soul void of all virtue: and
possessed of the devil of hell / as Judas the traytoure was which received
our lord Ihesu christ in the holy sacrament / in the last supper or
collacyon. And because that he was not in the state of grace but in deedly
sin / therefore he received not the grace of god / also our lord did not
tarry with him. And so there be four manner of folks / that receives the holy
sacrament.

The first receive it bodyly and not ghostly

The second / receive it spyrytually or ghostly and not bodyly.

The third: receive it not neither bodily nor ghostly.

The fourth / receive it bodyly and not ghostly / as hereafter is declared to
the health of the soul.

The.xxvii. Chapter / of four manner of folks which receives only the holy
sacrament bodily / to the da^pnacyon of their souls.
THey receive the holy Sacrament bodyly to the dampnacyon of their souls.

First / those which wyllyngly and knowing them self in deedly sin do go
to receive it / for such folks be deed in their souls. And as saint Austyne
writes: that as the soul of the man is the life of the body / so is also god
the life of the soul / taryenge and dwelling in the soul / And god and
deedly sin can not dwell together in one place. Therefore saint Paul says /
that a man shall prove and examyne him self before that he receive the holy
sacrament. A sinner shall examyne him self in three things / and so he may go
worthily to the holy sacrament.

First / if he repent him of all his sins passed.

Secondaryly / if he be purposed never to sin more.

Thyrdly / if he have mind and will / and will accomplysshe that same will /
to confess all his sins / and after the counceyll of his confessor to make
satysfaccyon for the same. All those having these three points be in the state
of grace / and without deedly sin. And in case that they should dye suddenly
/ god will have mercy of them. And may suerly receive / upon the mercy of god
the holy sacrament.

The other which receives the holy sacrament unworthily be those which
having no knowleg of any deedly syn^e by them commit / be in a perverse and
evil mind and will to do sin / as wyllyngly to hurt any man: or to haunt
lechery and uncleanness or to be proud or other like. For in all deedly sins
whereby a man may dampne his soul by the deed / so he may also dampne it
without the deed / only by will and consent. So did Judas receive the holy
sacrament being i^ the myscheuous will and mind to betraye our lord Ihesu
christ. And therefore did he receive within him the devil of hell / and
became worse after that he had received the sacrament / than he was before. So
also the people become worse and more obstynate in sin / which receive the
holy sacrament in an evil and peruers mind and will. They have all an evil
mind and will / which do not eschew occasyon to syn^e: whereby they should
fall in sin. The third manner of folks / which receive not well the holy
sacrament / be the Ypocrytes which resemble to be good outwardly / but within
they be full of all uncleanness / lechery / and envy. They be such which ones
in the year come to confession and do promise to amend their living / but
they do the contrary. They be also such which without occasyon by feigned
humylyte / do often times refrain to go to the holy sacrament / saying that
they be not worthy to receive it / in reprehendyng other which often times go
thereunto. If we will speak of the dygnyte / there is none worthy to receive it
/ in heaven nor in earth / neither Mary the mother of god nor the apostelles.
Nor god does not desire of us such prepayrynge as does apperteyne to his
mageste and dyuynyte / but he desires only of us such prepayrynge as is
possible to our power / nor he does not demand that we do not sin / or
that we have not sinned / but he desires only that after that we have sinned
/ that we be penytent and sorry therefore / and that we be in purpose and will
never to sin more. For saint Peter in the last supper did receive worthily
the holy sacrament / yet nevertheless he renounced our lord Ihesu christ
shortly after / and all the other apostelles did commit a deedly sin with
him. Wherefore man shall do that that is in him / going to the holy sacrament /
and co^mendynge him to god.

The fourth manner of folks / which receive the sacrament unworthily / be
those which presu^ptuously go to the holy sacrament in deedly sin / to much
trusting to the mercy of god / thinking it not to be sin / which they do
make no sin / which do not examyne their conscience before / nor remember not
their evil and peruers living / nor also have not contrycyon in their hertes
/ nor do not make their confession. And such folks albeit that they have not
knowledge of any deedly sin by them committee / yet nevertheless they going to
the holy sacrament committee a deedly sin / for they do put them self i^
peril. Saint Paul says / that the man shall examyne his conscience before
that he go thereunto. O what nombre of people there is: which bear many and
great sins upon them / and cares no thing at all therefore. They do chose a
confessoure which is very simple: which does led both the sinner and him
self to hell.

The.xxviii. Chapter / how greatly he synneth / which receives the
sacrament unworthily.
THe greatness of the sins of those / which receive the holy sacrament
unworthily and in deedly syn^e to their everlasting dampnacyon / may be
considered by four reasons.

First / for such folks be reputed before god for murderers of Ihesu christ
the sone of god. And as saint Gregorye says: they do commit greater sin
which do despise god reygnynge in heaven / than those which did crucyfye him
in earth. O what penance would a good catholyke man do / which should have
crucyfyed our lord / what penance is he than bound to do / which has
unworthily received the body of our lord god.

Secondaryly / such folks be often times punysshed in their bodies by syckenes
/ or by sudden death. And therefore commonly after easter comes syckenes /
pestylence / and other inconuenyence / And that is because the man so
unworthily and in deedly syn^e receives the holy sacrament.

Thyrdly / for they sin more enormely than the Jews / for the Jews did
sin by ygnoraunce. And as saint Paul says if they had known it / they would
not have crucyfyed the lord of glory. But the sinners christen men knowledge
god / and know well yt they be in great sin. The Jews have crucyfyed our
lord but ones / but the christen men do crucyfye him very often / in so much
that wyttyngly they do go to the holy sacrament in deedly sin.

Fourthly / such folks receive upon them the judgment of god / which he
shall give upon the dampened souls at the day of judgment / where he shall
say: go ye cursed people to everlasting fire.

Fyfthly / those that unworthily receive the holy sacrament / be like to Judas
the traytoure / which did betraye and deliver our lord Ihesu to the Jews.
And it shall chance unto them in hell / as it did to Judas for after that he
had unworthily received the holy sacrament: the devil did enter in to him / so
that he did betraye our lord Ihesu christ / wherefore afterward he fell in
dyspayre and did hang him self. So they become more obstynate in sin /
those which receive the holy sacrament daily in deedly syn^e / and they dare
boldly do that thing which other dare not think / ye and moreover do that
thing which the devil dare not do. And as Judas delivered our lord to the
Jews: so in like case men deliver our lord Ihesu christ / in as much as
they can / to the deuylles of hell. For they receive our lord Ihesu christ in
the place / which the devil does possess / and apperteyneth unto him.

Syxtly / this is an unkind man / for he dyspyseth god his creatoure / which
for him has suffered bitter death upon the cross. This is yet a greater
unkindness i^ the man that the diuynyte and power of god is ready for to come to
vysyte him with his dyuyne grace enclosed in the holy sacrament / and the man
makes him self unworthy to receive him.

Seventhly / such persons be more unhappy than other / for the soueraygne
goodness which is god: is hurtful and dampnable unto them / and the medycyne
of the soul is infyrmytie and death unto them. For as the holy sacrament is an
everlasting life unto them which do receive and use it well so it is death
unto those / which evil and unworthily receive it.

The.xxix. Chapter / of those which receive the holy Sacrament spyrytually
and not bodily.
THere be yet four manner of folks / which receive the holy sacrament
spyrytually or ghostly and not bodily / that is to say / they receive the
grace of the holy sacrament secretly i^ their souls / albeit that they receive
it not vysybly in their bodies / and shall be rewarded before god / as if they
had received it bodily.

The first sort which receive it spyrytually / be those which by feebleness
of infyrmytie and syckenes can not hold meat in their bodies / or which do
coughe much / or do cast and void fleume very sore and such other. These
persons shall coueyte and desire hertely to receive it / in beholdynge it with
great devotion saying. O good lord I do thank the that I may pay /
satysfye / and content the by a good will and mind. O good lord I thank the
/ that in all places I may find the. O good lord I thank the / that no
person may hurt or hinder me toward the. And I do thank the good lord
that when I have the / no person may take me.

The second sort which receive the holy sacrament spyrytually / be those
which sodaynely be taken with sudden death / as maryners on the sea / men of
war i^ the field / women trauaylyng of child and other like / which can not
have a confessoure to confess them / and to receive the holy sacrament. Such
persons having contrycyon and repentance for their sins and desire to
receive the holy sacrament / have before god received the holy sacrament i^
their souls. Yet nevertheless they shall confess them self before if it be
possible / and shall not trust to much in that / to the intent that god do not
withdraw his grace.

The third sort be those / which serve god in pureness of conscience / yet
nevertheless they refrain sometime through humylyte / to go to the holy
sacrament / but they here mass with devotion reverently beholdynge the holy
sacrament / and by desire to receive it. Such persons if so and in such
manner they here mass / they shall be rewarded before god: as if they had
received the holy sacrament.

The fourth sort which spyrytually receives the holy sacrament / be those
which be prepayred thereto: and humbly desires to receive it / but their
confessors will not agree thereto. Also relygeous persons which after the rule
of their order / may not go to the holy sacrament / but on days ordained by
their heedes. Yet notwithstanding they desire to receive it somtymes / the
which must be content: for before god they have received it spyrytually. And it
is somtymes more acceptable to god that the man do absteyne devoutly with
Centurio / than to receive our lord worthily with Zachee. Such persons shall
think that god has seen some thing in them / wherefore they may not be admyt
to receive the holy sacrament bodily. And so they may go before the blyssed
sacrament / and shall read devoutly these prayers following / the which saint
Frau^cys was wont to say and read with great devotion / or a man may say
them in his chamber before the crucyfyxe or cross of our lord god / thinking
that the very sone of god does hang there.

The.xxx. Chapter / what thing a man shall read which desires spyrytually
to receive the holy sacrament with his dyuyne grace.
THat man which spyrytually desires to receive the body of our lord Ihesu
christ with his dyuyne grace / virtue / and fruytes he shall humble him self
perfoundely before god. And shall read these five prayers devoutly upon his
knees or in his chamber i^ the manner here showed.

Here thou shall knele on thy knees and shall say.

O Lord Ihesu christ here I am upon my knees before thy blyssed iyes and
presence / as a sinner and an evil doer before a judge. And I know that after
thy justice / I have lost and forfayte my body and soul. Wherefore I pray the
good lord Ihesu christ / by the sentence of death wrongfully given of the /
that thou wylt be a merciful judge to me / when my soul shall depart from my
body. Amen.

Pater noster. Aue maria. Now thou shall rise up and say.

O Good lord Ihesu christ here I am before thine iyes and in thy presence: as a
bond man before his lord and master / whom I and all other creatures be
bound to serve euerlastyngly. I pray the good lord Ihesu christ that thou
wylt let me know thy dear will in all things to be done / and to let it be
acceptable to the / and let me not do that thing / whereby I may lease thy
love euerlastyngly. Amen.

Pater noster. Aue maria. Here thou shall knele again / and shall say hertely.

O Lord Ihesu christ here I am on my knees before thy blyssed face / as a pore
beggar before a rich king. I pray the O king of glory: that thou wylt cloth
my soul with the vestment of thy dyuyne love / and to enryche the same with
thy grace in all virtue / and to aorne the same with the perles of pacyence /
to the intent that so aorned I may com to the soueraygne marriage whereunto thou
have called me. Amen.

Pater noster. Aue maria. Here thou shall rise with fere / and shall say.

O Lord god Ihesu christ here I am before thy reuere^de presence: as a man
before his derest friend / whom I and al other creatures be bound to love / for
thou haste made and delivered us by thy precious blood. O benygne Ihesu christ
I pray the keep and defend me always / and grant me to perceive how good
and sweet thou art / to the intent that thereby all pain and joy / and also
all creatures may be bitter unto me. Amen.

Pater noster. Aue maria. Now thou shall knele again / and shall say.

O Lord Ihesu christ here I am humbly on knees before thy dyuyne iyes / as a
child before his father: of whom I have received body and soul / albeit that I
have not ben at all times obedyent / as a true and faithful child ought to be
to his father. I pray the O my father everlasting by thy paternall love / that
thou wylt norysshe me here in earth with the heavenly bread / and in chastysynge
me for my faults / have mercy of me / to the intent that so I puryfyed of my
sins / we may rejoice / thou in me and I in the / with all the saints in
heaven euerlastyngly. Amen.

Pater noster. Aue maria. The.xxxi. Chapter / of those which neither
spyrytually nor bodily receive the holy sacrament.
THyrdly / there be some persons which neither spyrytually nor bodily /
receive the holy sacrament / and that do withdraw them self from the lyfly
fountain of grace: whereby they become dry in their souls / as a branch cut
from a tree.

First / they be those which be hard herted / obstynate / and roted in their
evil and peruers living / and will not leave it / As those which be in
adultery / those which do led their lives in a light and common manner / those
which do haunt old fylthy / and dishonest tauernes or lodgings / or which do
possess goods vnryghtfully / or also which be in envy or such like deedly
sins. These persons / albeit that they sin lease because they do not go to
the holy sacrament in such an evil and peruers life: yet nevertheless they
sin deedly / because that one i^ the year they do not prepare them self to
the holy sacrament. For they might leave their sin and confess them thereof /
and so go to the holy sacrament / where as now they tarry in deedly sin and
in the state of everlasting da^pnacyon: in the which they may at all hours
dye.

Secondaryly / all Infydelles / as Turks / Sarazyns / Jews / and paynyms /
and other which do not believe in Ihesu christ the sone of god and in the holy
catholyke church. All persons blinded in their malice and sin / whereby they
despise the holy sacrament / and mock them that do receive it. And because
that they believe not in the sone of god / and do not receive him in the holy
sacrament / which is the life of the soul / therefore they abide and dwell in
death / and be deed in their souls.

Thyrdly / there be yet some which do not receive the holy sacrament / as
Herytykes / that is to say christen people / which understand the holy
scripture otherwise than the holy ghost does speak it by the prophets and that
that is ordained by the holy church / as to go to confession / to fast / to
go to the holy sacrament / to repute as no thing exco^munycacyon / and not to
sanctyfye the holy days / and to honor our lady and other saints / or to
give any almous in their honor to the poor folks / to despise and set at
naught pardons and indulgences / and of such other artycles they have many.
And these persons go not to the holy sacrament when and where they may / for
they believe not in the holy sacrament. And if they go to confession or to the
holy sacrament / they do it without faith / and because that they shall not be
known from other / and in like case they com to the church to here mass.

Fourthlye / they be those which take so great pain in worldly busynes / as
to go in to the country for marchau^dyse and other transytory things / that
they forgette to receive the holy sacrament. For there be some folks which if
they did not give them self thereunto / they would receive the holy sacrament
more than ones in the year / as on the four pryncypall and solemn festes /
and the feestes of our lady. But because yt they be cold in devotion / and
that they be loath to prepare them self and to confess them they let it
pass lightly / and go not to the holy sacrament / whereof they shall give a
compte before god. For that man that goth so seldom to the holy sacrament / he
becomes so slothful / so cold and dry to wards god / that he is often
times weary and loath to think of god: to here of god / and to serve him. And if
he do say one Pater noster: he feleth him self weary and thinks it very
tedyous. This is because that the soul is not often times fed and refresshed
/ whereby it becomes feeble / cold / and sick / and inclyned to deedly syn^e
/ wherein it does make an end of the life.

The.xxxii. Chapter / of them which worthily receives the holy sacrament in
grace: and how a man may know that he has received it in grace.
FOurthly / there be yet some manner of folks which receive the holy sacrament
bodily and ghostly in grace / to the health of souls. These be all good
catholyke persons / which have prepayred them self thereto with all dylygence
by true contrycyon and confession as is aforesaid. These persons will not
prepare them self only to receive well and worthily the holy sacrament / but
they be very dylygent in keeping and holding it with them. And there is.vii.
tokens whereby a man may know steadfastly / that god rests still in his soul
/ and in the holy sacrament.

The first is / that so long as a man is contryte and sorry for his sins
passed when soever he does remember them: such a person lives still in his
soul. But when a man reioyseth and takes pleasure in reme^brynge his sins
passed / than his soul begins to dye: and god to depart from him with his
dyuyne grace.

The second token is / so long as a man is dylygent to order his thoughts /
words and deeds / to the profit and health of his soul and to the instruccyon
and example of his neighbor / and that he do all his busynes and works with
fere / to the intent that no man take any evil example at him: And that he
desire that god only be honored in all his good works: such folks have god
enclosed in their hertes.

The third token is / so long as a man has pacyence in his trybulacyon: for
no man can tell what a man is in wardly / before that he be proved outwardly.
Some and many folks esteem them self to be good and holy / yet they can not
suffer or bear pacyently one little word / the which is a token that they be
far from the way of perfeccyon / for holiness consysteth in trybulacyon. For
it is better to have pacyence in trybulacyon than to do much good deeds
without pacyence.

The fourth token is / so long as a man has sauoure: pleasure / and joy in
the remembrance of everlasting life / in the word of god / in the passion of
our lord / and in other like / god is still resting in his soul. For if he
have no pleasure nor sauoure in these things / it is a token that his heart is
remplysshed and full of worldly and temporal things by carnal joy and
pleasure. And such folks have chased our lord Ihesu christ from their
souls: for carnal joy and spyrytuall consolacyon / may not dwell together
in one place.

The fyfth token is / so long as a man is fervent and devout in saying his
prayers to god / and that at that time he put away all rumoure and trouble
from his heart in as much as he may / and that he speak godly and fruytfull
words / and that he thank god of all his benefytes and goodness / as well for
aduersytie as prosperyte. Such a man has god remaynyng still in his heart:
but when he does begin to speak detraccyons or backbytynges / to curse / or
other evil words / it is a token that he is deed in his soul / and that god
is not with him: For he that is of god / he will gladly here to speak of god.

The syxt token is / so long as a man feleth him self ready to serve god / and
dylyge^t to all good works / it is a token that such a man has been worthily
at the holy sacrament. For our lord Ihesu christ moves the heart and the
soul within / how he shall live and keep him from sin / for the love of god
is never Idle i^ man for to cause him do well.

The seventh token is / so long as a man has in him the love of god and of
his neighbor christen brother / in loving god above all thing: and doing
to his neighbor as he would should be done to him / as to comfort those that
be desolate and co^fortles / to help the poor in their need / and such like
good deeds. This person shall not doubt but that he is in the grace and
favor of god.

The.xxxiii. Chapter / of the.xii. virtues and fruytes / which the man
receives / that worthily goth to the holy sacrament.
Finally it is to be declared what virtues and fruytes the good man receives
in going worthily / to the holy sacrament. Saint Johan in the apocalypse did
se in Paradyse.xii. manner of fruytes. The tree is our lord Ihesu christ /
which has borne and left to us in the holy sacrament.xii. manner and sorts
of fruytes against xii. maledyccyons or cursings / the which our souls
receive in co^myttynge a deedly sin.

First / sin causes the soul to be feeble and ready to all evil / but the
holy sacrament heleth the soul of syn^e / and makes it worthy of all virtues.

Secondaryly / by deedly sin man does bind him self to everlasting pain
and dampnacyon / but by the holy sacrament he is assoyled of all deedly sin.
And after the great devotion that he has toward the sacrament / the
multitude of pains and tourmentes be remytted.

Thyrdly / man does dyspoyle him self by deedly syn^e / of all the good
works that he has done in all his life / so long as he is in deedly syn^e.
But when he does return to grace / doing penance humbly for his sins /
and that he receives worthily the holy body of god / god restores again to
him all his good works.

Fourthly: deedly sin blyndeth man by neclygent ygnoraunce / and makes him
loath to leave his syn^e / but the holy sacrament puts in to the soul of man
by his virtue and might: a light of knowledge the which does illumynate the
soul and puryfye it / so that from thensforth man knows the will of god /
and the greatness of sin.

Fyfthly / deedly sin makes place for the devil / by his temptacyons in the
soul of man / but the holy sacrament does arm the soul of man against the
devil and his darts or temptacyons. For where he sees the blood of our lord
/ he flies from thens and the au^gelles do help the man to fight against the
devil and enemy of hell.

Syxtly / deedly sin inclyneth the man and does pluck him to many other
deedly sins / if it be not incontinent washed and taken away by true
penance / but by the blyssed sacrament man becomes steadfast and strong in
grace and ready to all virtue so long as he does not fall to syn^e again.

Seventhly / by deedly sin man is beseged of the devil / but by the blyssed
sacrament he is united with god / so that he love god: whereby he does pourchase
and obtain taste and sauoure of everlasting life.

Eyghtly / the soul of man dies of everlasting death by deedly syn^e / so
that it knows not what to do that may be acceptable to god / and to him
self profitable / but the holy sacrament does preserve and keep the soul of
man from the death of sin / so that he does abide in the life of grace / And
his works be acceptable to god / and to him self profitable.

Nynthlye / deedly sin makes a man sorrowful pensyfe and heavy of heart / and
hard and evil willing to all virtue / but the blyssed sacrament makes the
man worthy mete and ready to all virtue / and tourneth all his inward might
toward god / and spyrytuall joy and gladness.

Tenthly / man does depryuate him self by deedly sin of the passion / pain
/ and tourment of our lord Ihesu christ / of mary the mother of god / and of
all the saints. Also of all the good works and co^munyon of the holy church
/ and of all the goodness in heaven and in earth / but by the holy sacrament man
makes him self part taker of all the goodness that the sone of god has done
upon the earth / and of all other good deeds.

Eleuenthly / man is daily cursed of god and of the holy church for deedly
sin / whereby man has always an inconstaunt and troubled conscience / but by
the holy sacrament he pourchaseth in his soul / a sweet spyrytuall joy and
gladness / and great peace and rest in his conscience / the which does pass all
gladness and pleasure that man may have in all his life in this world.

Twelfthly / man is for deedly sin put out of the gate of Paradyse and of
everlasting life: and dysinheryte of the soueraygne richesse / but by well and
worthily receyuynge the holy sacrament it is forgyuen: as to a child and heir
of the precious treasure of the glory of heaven / the which they only shall
possede and euerlastyngly use and enjoy / which worthily / bodily / and
ghostly receive here in earth the holy sacrament / As christ him self says as
it is written in the beginning of the third book. Hic est panis. etc. This is
the bread descended from heaven / and all those which eats of this bread
shall live euerlastyngly / to the which bring us Ihesu christ very god and
man / enclosed and contained in the holy sacrament. Amen.

This prayer shall a man say when he goth to the holy sacrament / or for to
here mass devoutly.
I Do salute the most holy body of our lord Ihesu christ / contained in
this sacrament / I do confess and knowledge the with my lyppes / and with my
heart I desire and coueyte the / I pray the that thou will this day come to
conforte my poor soul gracyously / the which desires and coueyteth to
receive the holy oblacyon and fountain of all grace / to the end that I may
be with the in joy and consolacyon of thy presence / in body and in soul. O
benygne lord Ihesu christ / have not regard to my many fold sins / but
have regard to thy great mercy / for thou art he by whom all the world is
made and delivered. Thou art the innocent lamb which is offered up this day
to the father of heaven / for all the world. O most swetest heavenly bread. O
most joyful buurayge or drink / Give to my mouth a sweet sauoure of thy
wholesome presence / illumynate me with thy love / take away my malice and
sin: and put in me virtue and grace to the health of my soul. O most worthy
sacrament / I pray the yt by thy presence all mine enemies may be chased
away / all my sins forgyuen / and all evil temptacyon withstand and put
away / grant me a good and holy life / correct my manners and condycyons /
and all my works and deeds / turn them to thy will. O good lord open heaven
and come to me for to illumynate my understanding by this new light /
illumynate my desires / and corroborate and strengthen my trust and hope / to
the intent that from hensforth my life may so amend / that finally I may
come to good end. Amen.

Another devout prayer that a man shall say in going to the holy sacrament.
O Lord Ihesu christ I desire and coueyte this day to receive thy blyssed
body / as perfytely as mary thy most honorable mother received it in her
vyrgynall womb: so good lord descend and come in to my soul / not
according and after my deservings / but after thy great mercy. O lord Ihesu
christ I desire and coueyte this day to receive thy blyssed blood / in
washing away all my sins. O lord Ihesu christ / this day I coueyte to
receive thy blyssed spyryte / in recouerynge all my time lost and mysspent. O
benygne lord Ihesu christ / I desire this day to receive thy blyssed soul /
in infusyon of thy dyuyne charity and love. O lord Ihesu christ / this day I
coueyte and desire to receive thy blyssed dyuynyte / in assurance and
securytye / of the everlasting life. Amen.

Say three times this verse before that ye go to the holy sacrament. O lord god
I am not worthy that thou enter in to my house but speak only and my poor
soul shall be hole. Than go forth and receive the sone of god with all
mekenes and fervent desire And when thou shall have received him / read this
prayer which our lady did speak / after that she had received the sone of god
/ the which was this psalm. Magnificat anima mea dominum.

The Magnificat in english.
MY soul does magnyfye our lord. And my spyryte has reioysed i^ god my
sauyoure. For he has beholden the humylyte of his maid servant / therefore
all generacions shall bliss me. For he which is mighty / has done great
things to me / and his name is holy. And his mercy is from generacyon to
generacyon to them that fere him. He has made power in his arm / he has
sprede abroad the proud herted men. He has deposed and put down the mighty
men from their place / and has exalted the humble persons. He has
re^plysshed and fyllyd the hungrye and nedy persons with goods / and has
left the rich void. He has received Israel his sone / reme^brynge his
mercy. As he has spoken and showed to our fathers Abraham / and to his sede
for evermore. Glory be to the father / the sone / and the holy ghost / through
out all the world for evermore. Amen.

A man shall read this prayer after that he has worthily received the holy
sacrament.
O Lord Ihesu christ / thanks and praysynges be to thy ineffable and
incomparable benygnyte and goodness: which so louyngly has made me part
taker of thy blyssed body / and precious blood / wherwt thou have now norysshed
and fed my soul. O penetrable and persyng light. O light reluysant and
shynynge above all lyghtes. Illumynate and clear my understanding and shine and
perce my soul of all sides. So that no manner of spotte do abide there where as
thy dygnyte has come / thanks be to our lord god the father in his
puyssaunce and magestie / thanks be to our lord god / the sone in his
sapyence and wysdom: thanks be to the holy ghost / in his amyable pytie. O
lord Ihesu christ / in these three things thou art one. O amyable lord god
Ihesu christ / I thank the that thou have vouchesafe to here me / an unworthy
creature / and to rejoice and comfort my pensyfe heart. That that I have
desired of the / thou have given it me. And that which of long time I have
coueyted and desired / now I have received it. O lord god / thou art the
fruytefull tree of our health / the which thou thy self has planted in our
blyssed Lady thy mother / And of that same thy mother being a vyrgyne thou
have received nature humayne / wherewith now I am fed. O lord god / now is
the same self tree planted in earth where there is no humydyte nor moystnes of
grace. Wherefore I beseech the of mercy / that in the same it may please the to
send the sweet moystnes and dew of the holy ghost / the which shall cause
the noble rote which thou good Lord has planted in my soul to florysshe and
spring. O high power and mageste of the father enter in to my thoughts. O
sapyence and wisdom of the sone / enter in to my understanding and
intellygence. O pity of the holy ghost / enter in to my will / so that these
three mighty virtues may answer to thy trynyte: from whens they be com. And I
beseech the good lord for the great love that thou have to thy dear mother and
to all saints / that from hensforth thou give me grace to syn^e no more / and
to fulfill thy will in all things to the which the father / the sone / and the
holy ghost help and led us. Amen.

Another prayer that a man shall say after that he has been at the holy
sacrament / whereby the the pope (...) gives much pardon and indulgence.
O Most holy soul of Ihesu christ sanctyfye me. O most pure body of Ihesu
christ save me. O most sweet blood of Ihesu christ make me enter in to thy
love. O most pure and clear water of the side of our lord Ihesu christ wasshe
me from my sins. O most bitter passion of Ihesu christ comfort and
strengthen me. O most fervent sweet of the face of our lord Ihesu christ hele
me. O good lord Ihesu christ here and exalte my prayer / and in thy wou^des
hyde me / and do not suffer me to be separate from the: deliver me from the
devil and enemy of hell: at the hour of death help me and let me be set nere
to the / to the intent yt euerlastyngly I may rejoice with all the aungelles
in heaven / in gyuyng praysynges and thanks unto the. Amen.

Another prayer after that a man has been at the holy Sacrament.
O Lord Ihesu christ I pray the / that thy body and precious blood / which
I a poor sinner have received / may remplysshe and satysfye my soul / and
grant that in me there do not abide any spotte of sin / where now the holy
sacrament is entered. O good lord sauyoure of all creatures / which does not
desire the death of sinners: I beseech the most humbly by thy blyssed body and
precious blood / that thou will assure me from al fere and dread / and to
grant me peace with all men / and remyssyon of all my sins / to the intent
that the holy sacrament be not to my dampnacyon / but to the health and medycyne
of my soul. I beseech the also grant me grace and felycyte / and health to
living persons / and everlasting rest to those that be deed: and specially
have mercy of the souls of my father and mother / my brother or sister / and
of all my friends which have done me good / or for the which I am bound to
pray. And when the last hour of my life shall come / that the holy au^gelles
may receive me: and bring and led me to everlasting joy. Amen.

This prayer may a man say / when he has been at the holy sacrament: and when
he goth thereto / or eueryday in the weke / when a man has herd mass.

A prayer on the Sunday to all the saints in heaven.
O Most holy aungelles of heaven / Seraphyn / Cherubyn Trones / Pryncypalytes /

dyuyne will to the intent that by your prayers and merytes / we may all obtain

life with you / the which almighty Ihesu christ grant us. Amen.

Pater noster. Aue maria. A prayer to be said the Mondaye to three archau^gelles
