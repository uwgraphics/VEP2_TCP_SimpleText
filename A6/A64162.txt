THE CONVERSION, CONFESSION, CONTRITION, Coming to himself, and Advice, of a
Misled, Ill-bred, REBELLIOUS ROUNDHEAD. WHICH Is very fitting to be Read to
such as wear short Hair, and long Ears, or desire Ears Long. Written by
JOHN TAILOR.

The Conversion, Confession, Contrition, coming to himself, and advice of a
Misled, ill-bred, Rebellious ROUNDHEAD.
HE goes far that never turn's, but if I had not turned squarely and quickly
from my Orbicular Singularity, or Circular Rotundity, I might corporally have
turned Round under the Gallows, and spiritually gone Roundly to the Devil.
Therefore know all you (my seduced, abused, misled and bewitched Brethren) that
though in this following discourse, I do treat particularly or single of my
self, yet I would have you understand, that my intention is general too, and
of as many as have been wickedly Cheated by the Devil or his Agents, Factors,
and Broakers, of their Souls, their Consciences, their Loyalties, their Lives,
their Goods, their Wits, their Moneys, and what not?

Be it known unto all men (I could have said Neverint Vniversi, but that I
loved neither Latin nor University) that I was an honest Weaver, and in my
quondam time, or days of yore, I Whileom dwelt in White-Chappell near, that
great Magazine of mischief, London, where I lived poorly, painfully,
patiently, and contentedly; neither wanting or abounding, not greedy or needy,
having neither debtors to pay me, or my self any debts to pay. Thus did I
spend my diebis illis in a Mellifluous, dulcet, Candid Halcion of Harmony,
which continued to the expiration of a Jury of Almanacks, (for so long I lived
single, and wore Batchelers buttons, till I was at the years or age of
Whipper-ginnie) and then I was unluckily Ingeminated to a Reverend Corpulent
Midwife (or mad-wife) one whose experienced Gravity, and Grave experience, did
quickly assuage the fervor of my concupiscentiall cupidity, that before the
Consumption of one Moons various Perambulation, my old new Bride, had so
Metamorphis'd my flexible Pericranian, that I Resolved to waver from a Weaver,
intending to cast the Beam out of mine eye, which was no sooner in, but the
Shuttle entered into my Brain, so that (before I was aware) my head was turned
with a trice, as Round as a Top or Whirligigge.

For my Motherly wife had at the least 500 daughters, maids, wives, widows,
married, and unmarried, all Breeders (or Teeming women) the most, or greatest
number of which, were exceeding zealous in sundry Religions (scarce three of
them in threescore in one opinion) all devout in diversities, and all differing
in their devotions; and from all these (my sincere wife Saphira) had sucked so
many documents and doctrines, that she could discourse and dispute of all
points of Religion, beyond her understanding; all which she made me so perfect
in, that I was quickly perfectly mad, and imperfectly out of my wits; for I had
as many new diseases in my mind, as a horse could have in his body; first the
Wind Chollick of self love, and Ambition made me presume to seem to know
more, and interpret the Scriptures more near the original, then all the
learned and Reverend Bishops and Doctors could do. Secondly, I was
Broke-winded with a Round whirlewind of Tautology, that I held him the Rarest
man that could talk longest, and believed the greatest lies to be certain
truths. Thirdly, I was troubled with the Staggers, that betwixt the Dura Matter
of schismatic opinions, and the Pia matter of the true Protestant doctrine,
there were some whimsies infused, which made my Brains constantly inconstant,
tossed to and fro (like a dog in a Blanket) giddily from one new purified
Conventicle to another, and (like a Jade) I had all paces within the
Circumclusion of my supernodicall Noddle, I could Pace, Amble, Trot,
Hand-gallop, Wild-gallop, Fals-gallop, Tongu-gallop, to all the private
meetings, holy Assemblies, seditious Consultations, Brownisticall Rebellions,
Anabaptisticall, fustian fopperies, zealous Treasons, and most devout
disobedience; I traveled to every Contentious Congregation, and Edified most
wickedly wheresoever I came, I was at Boston, in Lincolnshire, where I heard Mr
Anderson the diligent Preacher say, that the Earl of Essex was Michaell the
Archangell, and that the King was the Dragon, which he must Tread under his
feet. verily it was strange doctrine to me, and I (like an ass) believed him,
for I thought that Preachers should not lie, or speak blasphemy and Treason in
the Pulpits. But since my Conversion I find, that the Archangell Michaell and
the Dragon are Typical, figurative or Allegorical allusions, of Christ's
Treading down of Satan, and his Triumphant victory over death and hell. It
were too much for me to write, or any Reader to read the numberless
instructions that those Topheticall Lecturers did in too many places belch and
bluster out, and all to no other end but (their own ends) to draw, enforce,
entice, persuade, admonish and compel by all means to be Rebels against God
and the King, to despise the Church Governors government, to trample down all
Law, and order, to scorn obedience, to hate Loyalty, to contemn faith, truth,
and honesty, to steal, rob, plunder, wound, deflowre, ravish, imprison,
fine, beggar, and murder all, that durst obey God in the observing of the
Protestant Religion, or be Loyal to the King in the obedience to him, and
observation of the Laws established.

In a word, I quickly learned the Art of ignorance, the Mystery of iniquity,
the Science of villainy, the Society of Rebellion, the Vocation of Treason, the
function of hypocrisy, and the knavery of all Trades. I had an excellent memory
to forget, to forgive any injury, and I was infused with an admirable
forgetfulness, not to remember benefits received. Me thought he was but a Barren
stirrell-Brain'd Preacher, that could not rayl at the King, abuse my suffering
Lord, revile the State, and call the right Honorable Lords, wicked
Counselors; I heard one at Roderhich (or Rederiffe near London) exhort the
People on a Sunday, to be valiant and courageous in the Cause, that they ought
not to stand in fear, or to be awed, cowed, or commanded, by the power or
authority of any one man, nor should they be afraid to sheath their swords in
the bowels of him and his Posterity, (whosoever he was) without respect of
Persons; and verily the man talked exceedingly edifying, I was taken mightily
with his doctrine, and so were many more of the Brethren and Sisters at that
time, in that sanctimonious Congregation. There was at the hearing of him one
Tailor (whom some do style, entitle, nominate, and cognominate, the
aquaticall, or Water-Poet) he (I say) was so bold to say then and there, on the
day aforesaid, in the place aforesaid, that the Preacher aforesaid, that prated
the Lecture aforesaid, was worthy to be hanged, as aforesaid, as many Traitors
had been aforesaid, in other Princes Reigns aforesaid, for less fault then
aforesaid, for the which Tailor aforesaid, for saying as aforesaid, was like to
be knocked aforeside and backside, but that he made use of his heels, got into
a Boat and away, as aforesaid.

Thus these provoking, moving, unbenefic'd Lecturers did fill me and the rest
with such forcible undoing documents, that we were all mad till we were undone
and beggered; I ran with all speed and carried that plate and money I had to the
Guile-Hall, where some crafty merchants, like decoy ducks, had brought in their
plate first, which was heaped and piled up to make a glistering show, to draw
and toll in such poor Widgeons and Woodcocks as my self, to bring our goods
and money in. And afterward the Rich decoyes did take theirs away again,
whilst we left our estates there, having no other security but the most
immense, unlimitable, inimitable, universal, inexhaustible, and unvaluable
Public Faith. Which Faith I have found (by singular deplorable experience) to
be nothing kin to the symboll of the faithful 12 good men and true, for their
faith was, and is a saving faith, but I have lost all the goods and goodness
that I had by fixing my hopes upon the Rotten foundation of the Faith politic
and public. Besides every good Faith (or Creed) has 12 good Articles; but
this new Faith has but two, (which two are true both, without Contradiction)
which are, give or lend with a good or an ill will, and be cheated, or beggered
like a fool; or deny to give or lend, and be imprisoned, rifled, and undone;
upon these two Maxims is this Faith grounded, and will be proved Authentical
by 10000 witnesses, and some of them have sealed it with their bloods.

It was in disputation what trade or Craftsmen they were that first invented
this new Rare detrimentall Faith; some said they were Tailors, that with the
mystical Sheeres of their Authority, could cut the Commonwealth (like
Broad-cloath) into what shape or fashion they pleased, making such large shreds
as may keep them and their Childrens Children warm till doomes day. Some said
they were the only skillful Fishers in the world, and that they went beyond
Ovid in metamorphising, for they had transformed this Kingdom into a Sea, and
all the goods of the Kingdom were turned into Fishes, which they caught with
the Net of their Almighty power, and disposed of as they pleased, the Mashes of
the said Net being so cunningly and strongly woven, that the huge Leviathan, or
the mighty Whale, the overgrowne Grampus, or mounting Pork-pice, could not
break through, nor the small Pilchard, the little Sprat, or the least Minnow
could escape, (for the Proverb in them was verified) All is Fish that comes to
the Net. But there was a third sort that said the Public Faith was made by a
company of Dyers, that dyed nothing but false fading Colors, scarce using any
wood at all but Logwood, and such sophisticated stuff being their chief
materials, which would not hold Color, but stain and spotted shamefully, so
that the people conceiving themselves to be gulld and consend, and the Diers
(taking notice of the peoples distaste) will give over dying of false Colors
any more, and do purpose shortly to dye knaves in grain.

J am almost mad, frantique, lunatique, besides my self, out of my wits, at my
wits end, or (call it what you will) J am not as I might, could, would, should,
or ought to be, in confiding what pains, cost, and peril J have undergone, to
make my self a beggarly Thief, a Rebel, a Traitor, or any thing, but an
honest man, and now too late, I find that knavery is a dear purchase, and that
truth and a good Conscience may be had and maintained at a cheaper rate then
villainy. It greeves me to remember how often His Majesty's Forces have taken
pains to beat me and my Breathren into a little good manners; yet I cannot
choose but rejoice at a speech spoken by a valiant Vintner at the George at
Queenhith, he being one of the Trained-Band of London, swore he would catch the
King, and came purposely to Newbury Battle, on wednesday the 20 of September
last, for that purpose, but being well thwackd there, and (with the nimblenes
of his feet) got home again, he swore that he would never (whilst he lived) go
any more a King Catching.

And thus, by the sway and command which mother Midnight my wife bare over me,
and the false instigations of such Pulpiteers, which she (upon the pain of her
scolding sealding hot indignation) enforced me to hear and believe, I grew to
such a pass, that I held the greatest Rebels to be the most worthy of places
of Eminency, and titles of Excellency, and that they (alone) were the best
Subjects and truest Christians that did most oppose the King, the Law, the
Gospel (and the Epistles too) without all manner and form, as followed, for
the first, it is said I should have but one God, which I find and know now to
be he that brought all the Israelites out of Egyptian Bondage under Pharaoth,
and has also delivered and redeemed all true believers from the Eternal
thraldom of our spiritual Egypt, from our slavery under sin, death, and
hell; This God commands, we should have no other Gods but him, but J (with my
associates) instead of serving him, (the only God) served no God at all.
Moreover my zeal was so hot, that because superstitious services has above
100 years ago, been used in our Churches, because Romish Masses, and too many
idolatrous Rites have been said, sung, and frequently exercised long since in
our Cathedralls and other Churches and Chappells; therefore, because they have
been abused formerly, I thought it convenient, to disgrace, deface, demolish,
cast down and ruinate all those famous Fabrics, and magnificent Structures,
never remembering (like a Rogue as I was) that the Churches were not to blame,
for the abuses committed in them, and that the holy Ghost did graciously enter
and dwell in a woman, whom seven Devils had formerly possessed.

Secondly, whereas he commands no graven Image, or any figure or likeness to be
made and worshipped, I (like an ignorant ass) presently began to tear,
spoil, and pull down, all Ornaments, Ceremonies, decent gestures, and all
things whatsoever was any way laudable, or any memory either of Patriarch,
Prophet, Christ, Apostle, Saint, Martyr, or Confessor, all which we knew to be
neither Papisticall or superstitious, neither would any one that has wit or
grace, either pray, adore, or confide in, to, or before, any thing, but to the
Almighty maker of Heaven and Earth, and his blessed Son our gracious
Redeemer. We knew the Cross in Cheap Side, was a stately and sumptuous
ornament to the City, and it signified to all Nations of Christendom, besides
Turks, Jews, Pagans, Heathens, Infidells, and Atheists, might take notice by
that, and all other Crosses, that we were not ashamed to be Christians, or to
maintain the sign or memory of our Savior Crucified.

Thirdly, there has no perfidious perjured people, that have more profaned or
taken the name of the Lord in vain, then we have done. I (for my part) did
swear and take the oath of Allegiance, and after that I took the oath of
Supremacy, which oaths and vows any reasonable man may believe had been
sufficient, and fit to be held and kept inviolable, but (as if those were of no
validity, and that we might Equivocate, Juggle, and play at fast and loose with
the searcher of all hearts) I with thousands more of fools and wicked
wretches, some voluntary, and maliciously, and some upon constraint, fearfully
and foolishly, took and bound our selves by oaths, vows, protestations, of
combinations, associations, and contracts, quite contrary to all that we had
formerly sworn, for our last swearing, were to continue Rebels all the days
of our lives.

Fourthly, we have in general, or for the most of us, remembered to unsanctifie
the Sabbath day, that whereas the Lord commanded it strictly to be observed for
a day of rest, we have frequently prayed, preached and practiced on that day
chiefly, nothing but disturbant Rebellions, Treasons, commotions, seditions,
and most horrible blasphemies, wherein the Lord and the Lords Anointed, were
either ridiculously, or treacherously abused, and neither the peace of God or
the Kingdom so much as mentioned.

Fifthly, whereas we are commanded to give honor to Parents, or our Fathers and
Mothers, whether they be Kings, Queens, or any other spiritual or temporal
Fathers and Magistrates, or our natural Fathers and Mothers, or Masters, who
should rule and govern us; In stead of honoring them, we have trod all
honor, obedience, allegiance, loyalty, respect, and duty under foot; The
Subjects have fought against the Sovereign, the people have despised the
Magistrate, the servants have resisted against their Masters, and the sons
have drawn their swords, and sheathed them in the bowels of their Fathers.

The sixth Commandment forbids doing any Murder, and we have observed it so
well, that we have, by committing most barbarous and inhumane Murders and
slaughters, made this sometimes Kingdom of Peace, an Aceldema, or field of
Blood, a very Golgotha of dead men's sculls, as if it were the slaughter house
of the world, and shambles of Butchered man's flesh for all the Anthropophagie
of man-eating Canniballs.

Seaventhly, Adultery is forbidden, and for the defense and maintenance of
Adultery, we have providently forbidden all power and authority that should
punish it, so that we having freedom, as Beasts have, have done worse then
beasts would do, for some Sons have made so bold with their own Mothers, that
they have proved with Child by them so that with Incests, Adulteries, Rapes,
deflowrings, Fornications, and other veneriall postures and actions which daily
pass and escape uncontrolled and unpunished, and as it may be conjectured
tolerated, England is almost changed in that point to the Isle of Paphos, and
if this world hold Venus is like to be mother of the Maids.

Eighthly, Thou shall not steal; Alas the breach of this Commandment has been
the only prop, and supportation in maintaining this unmatchable Rebellion, and
all the Rebels that are in it, were it not for stealing, theft, robbery,
plundering, and forcible extorting, we might all go hang our selves, for if
once we give over theeving, then comes Peace, to which we are mortal Enemies.

Ninthly, we should not bear false witness against our Neighbors, and we hold
none to be our Neighbors that love or obey either God or the King; therefore
we hold it no sin to traduce, slander, scandalize, belie, and falsely to
testify, accuse, and bear false wicked witness against any honest man
whosoever, and in our testimony we have been believed and rewarded,
countenanced and defended.

Concerning the tenth and last Commandment, which says, Thou shall not covet
any thing that is thy Neighbors, be it either, house, wife, Servant, Cattle, r
Goods; It is written that Covetousness is the root of all evil, and had we
not coveted things that were none of our own, and with an avaritious greedy
desire, raked and ransacked that which belonged not unto us; then had the King
still had our bounden obedience and tributary duty, then had all true Subjects
quietly enjoyed their own, then had his Majesty not been deprived of his
Towns, His Ships, his Castles, his Magazines, his Houses, his Lands, his
Customs, his Children, his Revenue, his Ammunition, his Subjects, and as near
as we could, of all that was near or dear unto Him, then had these mischiefs
never have been begun, this Kingdom had not lain weltring in her own blood, we
had not then been involved in unspeakable misery, nor kept in this perpetual
slavery, under the Abortive and usurping power of a pretended
Parliament-Everlasting.

Thus have I (with the rest of my wicked Brethren) broken all the ten
Commandments, but we should have broak the 11th too, if we had heard of it,
and infringed all the Laws of God, of man, of nature, of Nations, of Arts and
Arms, and in brief of all goodness both divine and moral; so that to make a
particular confession of all the abhorred crimes we have committed, I am
persuaded that auricular confession would be wearied, and all the race of
mankind would be returned to the first matter, or nothing, of which it was
made; but I humbly and heartily desire that this my acknowledgement and
contrition, may not only have remission, but also admission again into my most
wronged Sovereigns grace and favor, of which happiness I am in certain hope,
though I do almost despair that too many of my malicious and stiff Brethren,
though they know they have been accursed Rebels, yet they will rather go on
desperately with Judas (be hanged) or hang themselves, then with Peter, Repent
and weep bitterly for their Apostacy.

As naughty Boys, when they first practice pilfering, begin to steal Pins,
and proceed to points, and passing unreproved, fall at last to be perfitly
Grammard in the Art of filching, theeving, and robbery, and make no scruple to
commit any felony or villainy, so I at first, was but drawn in like an ignorant
Sot, and shortly came to the degree of a malicious Knave, and in a little time
(with the help of the Devil) I grew to the high Calling of a Rebel, and
shortly after (me thought) Treason was the only way to be secure, and the
impregnable Bulwark to defend me from the stroke and battry of Law and Justice,
for all my former notorious crimes committed, any manner of Roguery, whereby
the King might be injurd, was as good as Cake and Custard to me, and every
scurvy song, Rhyme, Lecture or Libell against the office and persons of Bishops,
Courtiers, and Cavaliers, was as sweet Music to me, as the fat end of a
Pudding, I was at a Market Town, called Mansfield, in the Forest of Sherwood
in Nottinghamshire, where my Brethren bravely threw, pulled and haled down the
Market Cross, and after that they spied a Carved round piece of wood in the
form of a Crown, which was fairly wrought, painted and gilded, and stood for
the Sign of the Crown, which we (like most violent valiant villains) did
pluck from the Sign post, and in reverence to the Crown, and duty to the
King, we dragged it through the dirt, and kicked it about the streets (O brave
Rogues) so that the Widow Hall, who was owneresse of the house, was feign to
have a new Sign made at her own charge, and verily this was then, me thought,
very pretty, foolish, witty, Roguish pastime.

Indeed we were all so infused or enthusiasmed with the Babilonian Confusion of
Amsterdamnable Religions and opinions, that we could never be quiet, till we
had brought our selves unto the slavery of the Rotter-dam'd excise; for we had
wisely considered that Foreign Nations, with all their strength and policies,
could never invade or overcome us, and therefore we thought it honorable to
imitate Ajax, for as none but Ajax had the glory to kill Ajax, so none but
Englishmen shall be famous for ruinating England, much like the pretty Bird
called a Viper, who, as it is related by Gesur, does murder his Mother by
gnawing a passage out of her womb into the world. Besides we were infected with
the heresy of the Counselors of Benadad King of Syria. 1. King. 20 23. That
God was the God of the Hills, and therefore we always ran to the Hills, and
skulk'd in woods and hedges, (like Thieves and Bandittes) for we never durst to
show our selves against the Kings Forces in the Plains, nor once abide the
hazard of a fair pitchd field; and yet for all these poor shifts and tricks,
it has always been our good fortune to be beaten, and to run away to
London, and there we patchd up our Rebellious Cowardly disasters, with
victorious Lies, in Pamphlets and Lectures, not worth pence a piece.

As concerning the four Cardinal Virtues ( Justice being one) one truly said
there was more Justice in Hell then in the Close Committee, for (said he) in
Hell there are none punishd but bad men, such as are profane Atheists,
Schismatiques, Rebels, Traitors, Thieves, Cheators; but these learned Thebans
do afflict, imprison, murder, and torment, none but good men, such as are true
Protestants, Loyal Subjects, and such as have a care and conscience to live in
Gods fear, that by so living they may most happily dye in his favor. And
another, of our own Tribe, being demanded more money to spin out the Cause, he
was so bold to tell the Publican tax and toll gatherers, that they who set them
on work were more uncharitable then the Devil, for which words he was brought
before the Tribunal of the Magnificent, Almighty Committee, and being
examined, he confessed he spoke the words, and would prove that the Devil had
more Charity then they; for the Devil did first bereave or take away Jobs
Children, before he took away his goods, but they did pill poll and take from
him all his goods and livelihood, and left him his Children to be starved, for
they had squeezd and draind him to the last drop, and left him nothing to buy
bread to put in his Childrens heads, and just so much is their universal
Charity.

And whereas at the first they Rebelled most Gloriously, with Gold and Silver
cursed contributions; now they are descended to that humble degree of Treason,
that they make shift to Botch and Piece out their wicked designs, with Goods
and Chattells, and with the sale of all manner of Houshold-stuffes, from the
Altitude of the most stately Arras or Tapistery hangings, to the low descent
and profundity of the Cole-house, or House of office, and (in Imitation of the
Emperor Vespatian) who made money by the sale or Custom of Urine, so they
have, out of the profit of plundered Pispots and Close-stooles, made a stinking
stir, all over this afflicted Kingdom, insomuch that he is worthy to be
accounted a Witch or a cunning Man, that can tell us before hand, what will be
their next shift, Milo the Crotinian (or Creatan) was famous for strength and a
good stomach, for it is reported that he brought up a Bull Calfe, and every day
would lift and carry the say Beast, by which daily exercise and practice, he
could carry him when he was grown to be a Bull, and that he killd the said Bull
with a blow with his Fist, and eat him up every bit in one day. and one
Nicholas Wood, a great eater in Kent, would eat up a Hog or a Sheep of Twenty
shillings price at one meal, these Monsters were, and are famous in memory,
for having good strokes in the Mouth* some are remembered for Lascivious
Luxury, us Heliogabalus, some for drinking, as Alexander, some for Pride as
Tarquin, etc. but we shall ever stand upon Record for the most unmatchable
Renowned Rebels, that ever lived in any Age or Nation, Jack Straw, Watt Tyler,
Jack Cade, Lambert Simuel, Perkin Warbeck, and all the Rabble of such fellows
never came near us in Impiety and Treachery, for they did never spoil and
demolish Church and Church ornaments* as we have done, and it is worthy of a
most Regarding Consideration, that His Majesty's forces wheresoever they have
come, have not any way used any Profanation or I^reverent demeanor toward any
Church* Chapel, or House that has been consecrated or dedicated to the
Service and Honor of God. So that the Turks, Pagans, and Infidels would have
showed more Civility, and less Barbarous savage Brutishness then we have done.

I tell you plainly, and most truly certify you (my too much wicked and
misconstruing Brethren) that I was persuaded in my Conscience, (as many Knaves
and Fools have been) that the King was inclined toward the Romish Religion,
but since the eyes of my mind are open, and that I hold it a slandering
unreverend and Traitorous aspersion, to say or think that either Queen
Elizabeth, or King James of ever blessed memories, were Papists, or did allow
or tolerate any Popish doctrine, and that now finding that my most Gracious
King CHARLES, has always been, is, and will be till His earthly Period, a
most constant defender of the true Faith, as those two His Royal Predecessors
were, and as His inviolable Oaths and Protestations do confirm, and farther
as his unparalleld life and conversation justifies: for in all the Towns,
Congregations, Churches and Chapels, which have been and are under His
Majesty's command, there was never seen or heard any one Mass, to be said,
much less to be allowed or connived at.

Therefore I boldly do give all those malicious, ignorant Villains the Lie,
which Lie (without repentance) will sink them to their Father of Lies, and
therefore I pray you to examine what mischiefs have been committed, by our
unmannerly, base mistakes, fears and causeless Iealousies, and once more
humbly return from the common Road-way, that leads to inevitable destruction,
let us no more believe any Capcase, Candlecase, Fiddlecase, prating Lecturer,
let us no longer be gulld with false Pamphlets, and abominable Lying Diurnalls,
who are all as full of Lies, as the writers of them are of Sin, for I have seen
some of those famous Devisers and Writers of Weekly news, that are so free and
guiltless of shifting, that they hold a clean shirt odious, and quite out of
fashion, and half a Breech, with a Doublet one sleeve has been their only
ware, eighteen pence, being a Stationers price for a Copy, which presently the
learned Author quaffes, puffes, and pipes away in fecundious Ale, and
Oderiferous Mundungoe.

I have called to mind that, ever since we began to be Rebels and
Schismatics, that we never gaind any Good, or did any thing worthy the name of
Well done. But as our leaders have been mischievously Malicious, and
Treacherous, so we have executed their damnable Inventions, to ruin the
Protestant doctrine, our King, and our selves, and this is the sweet sum of
all our detestable pains and profits.

Our Inventions and Actions have all been opposite to Piety and Humanity, so
that if there were no other argument to prove His Majesty to be Godly, Good,
Gracious, and every way a complete unmatchable Prince for His innated virtues,
our Disloyalty, our Averseness, our Refractory stubbornness, were sufficient
proof of His transcendent Clemency and goodness; for as lyeing Astronomers,
when they Prognosticate of a foul day, or an unseasonable Harvest, are (or
should be) ashamed when the weather falls out fair temperate and successful;
so we with shame, horror, and terror of consciences, may hang down our wicked
Roundheads, and blush (if we were not past grace) when we do but think how
ungratiously, undutifully, and perfidiously, we have dealt with so gracious a
Sovereign, upon no other grounds but malicious ignorance.

If there were no other mark, sign or token to prove the Office and dignity of
Bishops to be derivative from Christ and the Apostles, our opposition is
Approbation sufficient, that they have been, are, and ought to be beloved,
believed, Reverenced, and Honored. By which consequence it is apparent to all
the World, that those godly Members which His Majesty has justly excluded out
of his Grace and Favor, whom we adore and admire, as the Idolatrous Israelites
did the Golden Calfe; If there were no other demonstration of the foulness of
their Guilt, our servile, our slavish, our execrable obaying them, and their
unlawful Votes, is testimony sufficient to prove the Kings exception to be
Real, themselves cauterized in their crimes, and all we that have adhered unto
them to be miserable, uncivil, simple, poor, abused* cheated, Rebellious
Coxcombs.

As the Law of God is a glass of death, wherein men may see their Sin, so is
the Gospel a glass of Grace, where true penit^nts may see their Savior. And
as the Laws of this Land are (in their due execution) Rigorous and Terrible to
such whose guilty souls tells them that they are plunged in horrible Treasons,
whereby they have precipitated themselves into the bot^omlesse pit of Despair,
and by no means will dare to look the Law ^r Justice in the face, so a clear
and innocent man has a Breast that is Law proof, he can sleep soundly, and
eat his meat in quiet, and if it chance that he be questioned, either by malice
or information* he cares not, and the severest censure he fears not, he bears
his afflictions with magnanimous fortitude, and whether he Live or Dye, his
sufferings are his Glory.

And were th^se Almighty Beggermakers, those memorable Members and Commanders
of our Miseries, clear, and right, as they should be, then they would never
fear to put themselves to a fai^e and Impartial trial of the Law, where if
then they come handsomely of, their accusers will be perpetually infamous, and
themselves will shine with such a Burnished splendour, that shall daz'e the
eyes, and amaze the souls of their enemies, and their memories shall outlast
time, and dwell in glory with Eternity. Therefore (my Brethren) let me advise
you to hearken no more to them, they have coufened us too much already, they
have made us perfect in turning Marks to eighteen pence, and Nobles to nine
pence, and all to nothing; yet there is hope, though your moneys be gone, yet
you may have a small proportion of Wit left, which (guided by grace) may make
you turn a little honest, and assure your selves that those who do dye in
this most Horrid and damned Rebellion, against their Just and Lawful King,
they do dye in as desperate a manner, as those that murder themselves, either
by Hanging, Stabbing, Poisoning, Drowning, or any other desperate Way.

Return, God is Gracious and Merciful, despair not, the KING is full of
Piety and Clemency, FAREWELL.

FINIS.
