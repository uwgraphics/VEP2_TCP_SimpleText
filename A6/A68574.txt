The church of the evil men and women / whereof Lulyfer is the heed / and the
members is all the players dyssolute and sinners reproved.



The church of the evil men.
MI lord saint Bernardyn desiring the honor of god / and procuring the
salute of the poor souls / consyderyng the horrible blasphemes and sins
innumerable that is committed every day in playnge at the dyce and cards /
and other deuyllysshe plays / after yt he has preched fervently / and
suffysauntly declared ye great euylles and scandales that proceeds thereby / he
has composed a treatye by the which he shows from whens these cursed plays
are comen. And how god is offended grievously and in many manners by them / and
that by the same diverse go unto dampnacyon. The which treaty has been
extraught out of his book intytuled ye christian relygyon / and has been
translated out of laten in to Frensshe / and vysyted at Paris by four
venerable doctors in the faculte of Theologye / which have added and
dymynysshed that the which they saw serve unto the matter. For the which I
Henry Watson simple of understanding / have submytted me under correccyon to
translate this little treatise in to our maternall tongue of English for the
salutacyon of ye souls of them the which plays / praynge all the reders or
herers of the same to have my robuste language deuoyde of vndepured eloquence
for excused.

O Diui ecclesiam malignantium et cum impus non sedebo. psalmo vicesimo. v God
the creator speaking by ye mouth of the prophet royal Dauyd against the
sinners says in this manner I have hated the church of the maly^cyous or
evil men / and I shall not be with men vnpyteable or without mercy. For the
declaracyon of the which words it is to note that in ye holy scripture is
made mencyon of two chirches. The first is the church catholyque / of the
which my lord saint Poule in his pystyll. ad collocenses primo. says Ipse
est caput corporis ecclesie. Ihesu christ says he i^ the heed and lord of the
church of ye catholyques. The second is the church of the cursed or evil of
the which the prophet in the auctoryte aboued specyfyed to^^cheth three
points or mysteryes.

The first is inuencyon. The second offensyon. The third oblygacyon.
At the first point or mystery he touches the for^^ and the manner how that
same cursed and unhappy church has been founden. And for to have of this
knowledge the holy doctor above named says that the enmye of the christian faith
/ prince of hell and of derkenesse / Lucifer seeing that the blyssed Ihesus
had constructe and edyfyed the said holy church catholyque by ye which diverse
on the se of this miserable world was drawn and conduyted to the port of
salute / and to ye blyssed realm of paradyse. Asmoche by the predycacion of
the appostles and dyscyples of our lord as in receyuyng worthily the holy
sacraments of the same holy church our mother / and in herynge devoutly the
dyuyne service he shall have by conspyracyon and envy dyabolyke make conuoke
and assemble all his subgectes pryncypalles and worste complyces / for and to
the end to declare unto them that which he had by his obstynate malice
ymagyned in his heart. In saying unto them this the which follows. Children
of maledyccyon and replete with malice your iniquyte knows that of my nature
and condycyon I am besy about the perdyccyon of souls / and apperteyneth also
by mine office to procure the dystruccyon of the christian faith / and find new
inuencyons for to bring the souls unto dampnacion eternal. And after this
that I have longly and profou^dly thought I have ymagyned and found amongst
the other a subtle inuencyon by the which we may easily win and draw unto
us ye most part of ye world that we have lost in the baptysme of crist. you
wot and I also by your report dyabolyque that our adversary christ has
constytued in the earth a church for ye good by the mean of the which we
lose our men that were almoost all ours / and now they dymynysshe gretely /
for the which it behooves me to constytute and reyse up a church contrary for
the evil / by ye which I may win them. And unto the end I will that all ye
things ordained in his said church for welthe and to the honor of god and
salute of the souls be ordained in mine for ill / in dyspyte of god / and for
the perdyccyon of souls. And therefore I considering that the world desires
joyous things pleasant and delectable that more easily draws the hertes of
men and women than he shall leave all the work that he has enterprysed for to
rynne to play. Item in like wise in the church of god there is a manuell /
also in our cursed church full of iniquyte the manuell shall be that the player
shall rob his fader or mother / or some other of his kyn^e / or if his wife
have some good Jewel he shall take it / and the dysmes and the dettes abide
unpaid / and the testamentes of the deed are not accomplysshed. Item there
lacks ye stole / that is that after that the unhappy player shall have pylled
and robbed his kynnesmen and friends he shall rob some stranger / by the
which shall be given unto him a halter for to be hanged and strangled. There
lacks yet said lucyfer a chasuble that is the iactaunce of the players that
sometime shall say sw^re and vaunte them in gloryfyenge them in their malice and
sin by the blood and by the death. etc. I have well wrongen him / weneth he
to win of me. and right often shall blaspheme god in saying unto their wives
that they have won for fere to have noise ^ leyeth with open mouths. The
clothe of the alter shall be the grene tapyssery or other clothe / and the
chalyce shall be the box that the part of them that snoffeth the candell is
put in. As for the messes and sacryfyces. Even so said Lucyfer as in the
church of our aduersarye the priest begins Introybo and makes his
confession Also mine introybo and my confession shall be the inuentour of them
that gothe play. One unhappy player and hasardoure shall come in the morning
invent his semblable saying unto him will thou not come / knows thou not
that the other are before. Ha ha answers ye other I have not herd mass.
Care not therefore says the inuentoure thou shall go another time / And right
often the unhappy wretches makes their parties on the saterdaye for the
sunday / to the end yt all the journey be given unto my dampnable service.
Then after the priest gothe unto the alter for to say ye introyte / and there
is known whereof the mass shall be Also the introyte of my service dampnable is
that the players shall say / play we at the romfle / the other shall say play
we at the tryumphe. And even so as in the church of god there is seven masses
more common than ye other as before is said. Semblably in my church there is
seven specyalles / which is / the mo^mom / the gleke / the flusshe / the
torment / the regnet / one and thyrty / and ye tryumphe. Item there is also at
ye mass of christ Kyrieleyson that is asmoche for to say as who said unto god
/ lord give us mercy / which is a song and orayson right fair that is said
and pronounced thryes. iij times that is.ix. times / in the name and reverence
of the trynyte and of the.ix. ordres of aungelles. But at ye Kyrie of my
church shall be spoken and pronounced blasphemes upon blasphemes. For the one
shall swear by the blood of god / the other by the flesh / the other by ye
womb / the other by the heed / the other by the body / ye other by the death /
and consequently of the other. And right so as in the church of god all the
priests when they have song the Kyrye alone they end all together with one
accord and tune / euenso right often the players renyeth god / or blasphemeth
horrybly all together in such wise that it seems to be mine hell / as it is
for to speak proprely. For right so as paradyse is there as god is / in like
wise there as yt devil is / is hell. Item said lucyfer in the mass of god
there is Gloria in excelsis in diverse tunes after ye dyuersyte of ye feestes.
Eue^ so I will if it be the feast of god that he be renyed / and if it be the
feast of his mother yt she be blasphemed / if it be the feast of any saints
that they be dyspyted and iniuryed. Item even so as there is oraysons y^ is
said hertly / also the oraysons of y^ players shall be syghes yt they shall
make hertly when they have lost / and in weeping is almoost in dyspayre. Item
there is the pistyl that is said in remembrance of ye good men of the time
past Also the pystyll of my church shall be the recordacyon of ye players of
ye time paste / for often my players shall say. By the death such one was a
nymble player / for when he came to play he had but five shyllynges and wanne
a ryall / such one could nothing like him for he lost ten nobles and his
gown in one night. Nor su^che one in like wise that lost a hundred and his
heritage. Even so happen it to ye my fellow / but to y^. Now let se who shall
have ought / look there the deuyllyshnes More over there is the grayll of my
fendysshe church. That shall be the sins yt the players co^mytteth from
degree to degree / from auaryce to rapyne / from rapine to vsurye / from vsurye
to leynge / from leynge to blasphemynge / and so of the other / in such wise
that I have made fyftene pyttes for to make the cursed players dyscende in to
my helles. Item there is the gospel that is asmoche for to say as good
messenger. The player prays god sometime saying / I pray god my fellow that
thou may lose. The other answers I pray our lady the which is above in
heaven that I may win O how the vnhappyes are cursed to pray god that he help
them to win to their dampnacyon / and in serving the devil. Item said
Lucyfer there is the Creed. That is that the players bileueth that they shall
not deye. There has been diverse that has been seek unto the death / but with
great pain they were heled when they returned unto the play again. And
sometime in their sekenes for to recover health they find not more gretter
consolacyon for to pass the time than to play at dyce and at cards / or to
go from tavern to tavern / or from bordell to bordell there as it noyeth
them not as to pray for their sins / or say dyryge for / all christian
souls. As it appears by a man of the church yt was seek which demanded
counsayll of a doctoure if he were not excused for to say his dyuyne service /
for because said he yt his heed aked when he saw his portoys. And every day
he was three or else four hours playnge at dyce and at cards / and doing the
service of Lucyfer. After following there is at the mass the offrynge when the
priest offreth to god the breed and the wine. Also in my church dyabolyque all that ye which is brought to the plays prohybytes and defended is offered in my
name and for my service. Now how many may be fou^den that would not offer five
shyllynges to god ^ and offreth well ten nobles or more unto the devil. Faders
and moders ought for to keep them well from gyuynge their children ought to
offer to ye devil Item in my church said Lucyfer there is secret oraysons.
That is the great ire / dyspyte / and sorrow that ye players have which
knaweth their consciences. The preface shall be the lamentacyons that the
players make after that they have lost. Alas shall one say I am well unhappy I
have lost a noble as much as I have won this fortenyghte. And the other
answers him. proficiat vobis. without having pity on his fellow no more than
on a dog. Item the priest at the mass of god makes crosses. Also the cursed
player so^^tyme with his dagger smyteth upon the tables or pe^^ceth the cards
and casts down all to ye earth. Item for the presence of the aungelles that
assysteth at the sacrament of the alter shall be the presence of the deuylles my
subgectes that enuyronneth the cursed players. Jeremy quintodecimo says. Non
sedi in consilio indencium. That is for to say said god the creatoure by the
mouth of Jeremy. I shall not be in ye company of the that plays / Item in
the mass they make three part^^^ of the holy hostye / also the players leseth
their bodies souls / and temporal gods. Item ye priest says three times
Agnus dei in remembrance of the three manner of folks that were converted at
the death of our lord Semblably at the service of Lucyfer there is three manner
of folks that conuerteth them to the devil of hell First the players.
Secondly they that assyst and behold play. Thyrdly they that mynystre y^
instruments for to play. Fynably said Lucyfer my post co^mmon / that is
assemblynge by every player that which he has won and put it in his purse.
And the last oraysons are dronkerdnes / glotonyes / and lecheryes that
ensues. The one shall say in his orayson go we to drink / By the womb I
deye for thirst. The other shall say go we to the bordell / or to the hot
house. And the other shall say go we sleep / and shall be in bed unto none /
The priest retorneth to the people sainge Ite missa est and gives leave to the
people gyuynge them his blyssynge. Also my leave of my service dampnable is that
ye souls of all players are given in to the hands of satan and other my
tormentours. The merit of ye assyste^tes / is perteyners of all the sins
that are there perpetred. And the blyssynge is maledyccyon eternel / because yt
the winners and the lesers are cursed of god. And if they do not penance they
go unto hell with all the deuylles. For they that lose / leseth paradise / and
they that win / wynneth hell. From the which peril and danger the sweet
Ihesus deliver us. Amen.

The second mysterye.
THe second mysterye that the prophet Dauyd touches of ye said church of ye
cursed dicitur offensio. That is of the great euylles and horrible sins that
proceeds of these unhappy plays. Some cursed blind folks say that it is
none ill for to play / and that it is but a sport / and that it is great folly
for to preche it / and that they play but for to pass ye time. But and they
will think and behold dilygently they shall find.xv. euylles y^ proceeds of
those dampnable plays / of the which.xv. euylles there is not one but it is
suffycyent for to make one lose paradyse. Alas what shall it be than of them yt
co^mytteth three or four together / and sometime all the.xv. And of these.xv
Alexander of alles in the fourth part of his sum in the questyon.xlviij.
puts the first.ix. Master Ioha^ Gerson in exposynge the commandments of
god puts.xij. Master Anthony of Florence in the second party of his sum
puts.xxj. And ye holy saint bernardyn that treats this matter puts.xv.
that is.xv. pyttes for to dyscende in to hell / as.xv. speres that Lucyfer
gave unto the players for to make war ayenste Ihesu christ. If you demand
which are the.xv. speres. Saint bernardyn answers.

The first is desire to win ye goods of other. The second is ye will to
dyspoyse his fellow. The third is vsurye right great. The fourth haboundaunce
of lesynges. The fyfth is fou^tayne of forswerynge and blaspheming* The syxte
is corrupcyon and dystruccyon of youth. The seventh sclaundrynge of good
folks. The.viij. dyspraysynge of ye prohybycyons and defence^ of the church.
The.ix. loss of time. The tenthe frauds and falsenes. The aleuenth anger and
debates. The twelueth dysperacyons and madness. The thyrtynth folysshe
adoracyon. The fourtynth nourysshynge of osyuyte. The fyftynth vile life and
dyshoneste.
The first spear that is how he has great desire for to win the goods of
the other / it is auaryce and cupidite root of all euylles which is commonly
in the players. Some say I had as lefe lose as win. But it is not truth.
How well that he be a great lord and that he plays but a penny or a grote yet
would he not lose / either by pride dysdeyne / or shame or some other vice but
desires for to win. And thus it is auaryce and couety^e to have the goods
of other / that is right against the commandment of god that says. Non
concupisces rem proximi tui. That is for to say. The gods of other thou shall
not coueyte for to have unjustly It is another thing of the desire of a good
labouryng man that desires to win his journey / for thou has his pain and
his labor. But at the play thou does thy ^elowe no prouffyte / but great
do^mage / as well unto the soul as unto the body / and goods temporalles
First as unto the soul / for oftentimes for the play he loses the dyuyne
service / and the things that apperteyneth unto his salute. Secondly as unto
ye body / for he consumes him night and day / and yeldeth him inutyle for to
work. Thyrdly as unto the goods temporalles for sometime he loses his goods
and others also. How then may thou coueyte his silver than with a clean
conscience. And therefore says my lord saint Poule prime ad thimothe^ sexto.
Radix omnium malorum cupiditas. Couetyse says he is the rote of all ylles and
of all sins. Certainly it is commonly in ye players / by the which it will
procure in them the branches of sin / as a rote of a quycke tree. That is
for to wit rapyne / usury / lesynge swerynge / blasphemynge and ye other that
ensues of cupidite and auaryce. And of this couetyse as it is rote of all
euylles is syngulerly written by saint Gregory and saint Ambrose in the decrete
that begins bonorum. And in the decrete following in the.xlvij. dystynccyon.

The second spear is volu^tas spol^a^di. For you would dyspoyle him yt you
plays with / this is rapyne domestike those that seem hard and dyffycyle. We
shall call our said church under the name and title of game. And by this
mean we may recover in to our dampnable subgeccyon them and they that were
escaped from our hands with diverse other. These things said all the satalytes
and complyces dyabolyques answered in this manner / in cryenge and howlynge with
high voices / we will and consent to all this which thou says / and we
rejoice us / and with all our power we shall enforce us for to help the to
accomplysshe thy dampnable purpose. For we demand nothing but to do ylle.
Then said Lucyfer to the end that more unhappily ye thyn^ge come out in
effect it behooves in this church after our malice acheued to edefye three
things.

The first is the offices and benefyces. The second the instruments and
apparayll. The third solempnytees and sacryfyces.
First said Lucyfer I will ordeyne in my church ye offices and benefyces. And
even so as in the church of christ our adversary there is one chief y^ has
all puyssaunce / that is for to wit the (...) / in likewise I will that there
be one heed in my church / And that shall be I that shall be the heed of ye
players and of the other unhappy dampened.. And then answered al his suppostes
it pleases us / it pleases us. After said Lucyfer I will have cardynalles /
and ordeyne that they shall be ye great lords the officers and all the prelates
that takes away these plays whereof proceeds so many euylles / and sins /
as bayllyes / the iuges / the prouostes / ye leuetenauntes / the mayres / and
all them that may take them away / how well that theyrselfe play not. Quia
qui facet consentire videtur. That is for to say who y^ is still and may
punysshe seems to give his consentyng to the thing that he sees done. The
most gretest lords are y^ cardynalles ye which is by my side. Their names
are regystred in ye books of the dampened. And then after I will have bysshoppes
in my church. Tho shall be the gentylmen / burgeyse / and merchants yt have
the great halles / gardyns / and courts there as is tenysplayes / closshe /
berlan / fre square / and diverse other semblable plays that scoles be holden
of. Item there is ye house episcopal beside the church. And also in this
manner I will that beside mine be bordelles tauernes sellers / and hot houses
dyssolute there as is committed so many horrible sins. After even so as in ye
church of our adversary there is chano^s / and curates I will that the
hostelers and tauerners be our curates there as our subgectes may go drink /
laugh / and make good chere. Our chanons shall be they that assyste and behold
the play and wage / or lenne money for to have part of the butyn or winning
that ye same unhappy players shall make / Ite^ more over I will have chapelles
even so as there is in the church of our adversary christ / and that shall be
the barbers shoppes and such manner of folks there as is tables for to pass
the time when they have nothing to do. Item I will have oratoryes and places to
pray in / for there is in ye church of our adversary. That shall be the
houses of some burgeyses merchants / where as secretly and not openly they
resort and play together three or four / or five or six hasardours and other
miserable men and women And shall be there unto mydnyght playnge at dyce or at
cards. And unto all the abouesaid players for their service / dystrybucions
and wages we shall receive them with us / and promise them the wages of
everlasting dampnacyon. Item yet will I that there be diverse men and women for
to come and se the service in our church / as at the service of our
adversaries church / And that they keep great scylence / and behold the
players affectuously swear / and blaspheme / and wrong each other. It shall be
they the which beholds ye players play at dyce or cards / the which shall
be well by the space of three or four hours or more in lokynge / and beholdinge
the players / indurynge cold / hongre / and other necessytees. And shall not
anoye and weary them so much as to be one hour in the church of god. Also to
the end that my church fail not / and because that diverse of our officers
may happen deye I will that the children look upon their faders that play and
servants their masters / and so of other degrees as well the au^cyentes as
other / to the end that they take pleasure in it / and that they may learn and
contynually uphold it. Right so as in the church of god the children learn of
the ancient men for to uphold the service of christ after their dethes. And
yet better to the end for to have young folk among the old I ordeyne that
ye first day of the new year they give unto the children maidens and bachelors
newe^yeres gifts / as pynnes / points / and money for to bye lekerous
things / for to go to the tavern and other places dyssolute and ill. to the
bordelles and other unthrifty places / by this we may win much. Unto the
which answered all the deuylles of hell his complyces with one voice / be it
done be it done / be it done we consent thereto.

The second party.
COme we now unto the second party in ye which it behooves to se and speak
of the instruments and apparayl of the church diabolyke in the which is the
ordinance yt follows. And Lucyfer said. I ordeyne the instruments and
apparayll of my church. And first because that in the church of our adversary
christ there is a mess book for to say mass / even so in ours there lacks
one / and I ordeyne that it shall be the dyce. For right so as in ye mess
book of the church of god there is.xxi. lettres by the which the christian men
and women knows the will of their creator / also in the dyce that is our
mess book there shall be.xxi. points by the which al my servants the
players shall know my will. Upon this point one may demand how one may know
ye cursed and dampnable will of Lucyfer and to whom he has reveled it.
Answer that to a Senator of Rome the which was of so peruers and evil
gouernynge / that by his glotony and lubrycyte he became lazar and pudacre. And
when he saw that they separed him from the company of the other he was so
impatient that he swore that he should venge him on god. And one day after
diverse blasphemes he thought how he might do some thing in dyspyte of god
and of crystendome / anon came the devil of hell to him in the form of a
black man and demanded him what him ayled. He answered that he was half
mad and that he thought and sought how he might do any thing against god
for the perdyccyon of souls. Then the devil presented him a dyce and said unto
him. If thou wylt do that ye which I shall tell the thou shall be cause of the
dampnacyon of innumerable souls. And what said he. It is that thou play with
this dyce here and learn ye other for to play. And when yt in playnge there
comes one point thou shall say in dyspyte of god. When there comes twain /
thou shall say in dyspyte of god and of his mother. When there comes three /
thou shall say in dyspyte of the trynyte. When there comes four / thou
shalt say in dyspyte of the four euangelystes. When there comes five / thou
shalt say in dyspyte of ye five wounds of christ. When there comes six /
thou shall say in dyspyte of the six solemn feestes of ye church of god.
There is the inuencyon of ye dyce. And after lucyfer said even so as in the
mess book of our adversary there is many and diverse messes / for all that
there is seven most common that the ygnoraunte priests say. The sunday of
the trynyte / the mondaye of all souls / The tewesdaye of aungelles. The
wednysdaye of all saints. The thursdaye of the holy ghost. The frydaye of the
cross. The saterdaye of Marye our aduersarye. Thus said Lucyfer to satan.
Thou shalt have in dyspyte of all the souls in purgatory the mass of monday
Thou beelzebub in dyspyte of the aungelles thou shalt have the mass of
tewesdaye. Thou astaroth in dyspyte of all the saints in paradyse thou shall
have ye mass of wednesdaye. Thou asmodeus in dyspyte of the holy ghost you
shalt have ye mass of thursdaye. Thou mammona in dyspyte of the passion of
christ our enemy thou shall have the mass of frydaye. Thou belphegor in dyspyte
of Marye our adversary thou shall have ye mass of saterdaye. And I said
Lucyfer will reteyne that of sunday in dyspite of the trynyte of paradyse. For
unto me apperteyneth the most solempnell. Upon this point is to be noted that
when one will make a mass to be said he ought to make it to be said of the
day / or else let the priest do it after his devotion. And here is as of the
mess book. After said Lucyfer even so as there is in the church of christ a
portoys for to say matynes and euensonge. Also I will have one in my church /
and ordeyne that it shall be the cards. And right so as in the portoys of our
aduersarye there is diverse hystoryes / as the hystorye of the natyuyte / of the
resurreccyon / of kings and diverse other / in like wise will I that there be
pompous hystoryes in ours / as kings / queen's / and varlettes. I will more
over that my stories have great sygnyfycacyons also well as they of christ. They
that are painted within sygnyfyeth ye auaryce and cupidite of the cursed
players. And those of ye kings sygnyfyeth pride inobedyence and arrogaunce.
They of the queen's lecherye and lubrycyte. Those of ye foles the great folly of
ye players that weneth to win a thing transytorye / and leseth the rychesses
eternalles. And those of the varlettes sygnyfyeth that the players are
s^ruau^tes of me Lucyfer. Upon this point is to be noted as says saint
Ambrose. He is reputed servant of the master that does his operacyons. The
cards with painted hertes sygnyfyeth that they which play have given their
hertes unto the play and unto the devil. And those there as is the trafles
sygnyfyeth the folysshe joy that they take in serving lucyfer. They of pyckes
sygnyfyeth the noyses and debates ye proceeds. And those of dyamondes
sygnyfyeth that ye church infernal shall be paued with their souls. Loo here
as touching the portoys. And is to be noted that diverse say when they are
rebuked for playnge at cards that they do it but for to pass the time / and
for to take recreacyon. But thou player I demand the if thou found a book
in thy chamber / and were well sure that the devil had composed it if thou
would pass the time for to read in that book. I believe that nay / and yt thou
should not be well till that it were out of thy house Be ye sure and certain
that the devil of hell has made and composed the dyce and the cards. And
my lord saint Bernardyn would not have said and preched it / nor left it by
writing if he had not ben well informed. And therefore euenso as they that make
/ sell / and bye books for to say the dyuyne service may be called the
lybrayres of god. Semblably they and those that ma^ke sell and bye the cards
wherewith they do make the service of the devil may be called the lybrayres of
the devil. And if they say that we will confound them and dyshonoure.
Answer. But clean the contrary / we will reyse / honor / and save them. It
appears. if o^ne were in ye service of a hangman / and that his friend
purchaced him an honest office in the court of the king / he should do him
great pleasure and honor. / Right so will we draw them out of the service of
the hangman of hell such makers / sellers / and buyers of cards and purchase
and put them in to the service of the king eternell the which reygneth in
heaven. And after that Lucyfer said unto his complyces infernalles / the which
were about him making great Joy. In the church of christ there is the auter
/ also for our alter shall be the tables. And as before the alter of our
aduersarye there is a little wyndowe for to put the relyques in / in likewise
shall we have a sachell tied to the tables for to put the dyce and ye table men
therein. And also as there is alters portatyues in the church of god Semblably
we shall have tables portatyues for the ladies when they go on sporting. And
after said Lucifer in the church of christ there is ye vestementes. First there
is an amyt that they put on the heed / right so the amyt of my church shall be
ygnoraunce and blyndnes of the players / for they have no conscience of nothing
and cares not for any thing that is told them. It is certain semblable that
they confess them not / in so much as they return after their confession
unto it again. And sometime it happens that the fader and the mother repreueth
their child / and for all that they do but mock them / and have no conscience
nor fere of god. Item said lucifer there is a white aube by ye which is
sygnyfied that diverse oftentimes plays their gowns / and wereth because of
the play their shyrtes knotted upon their sholders. Item there is a gyrdell
that holds the aube. This gyrdell here in my church is the great affection
that draws the players to the play and that holds my servants for to do
my service. It is a great thing of the dysordynate affeccion of a player /
sometime he shall rise out of his bed / or shall depart from the church and
leave the dyuyne service when his fellow makes him any sign. And how well yt
the said player has much work on hand and that he has promised to yield
it at a certain For whiles that they play if one cried take ye thieves none of
the players would flee / for they are thieves domestiques. But for to speak more
proprely this rapyne is myxt with treason / for it is committed oftentimes in
etynge and drinking the one with the other. This cruelte is right often among
the players / for the one wold^ have dyspoyled the other unto their shyrtes /
more than does the outlawes. And diverse times he whi^che weneth to dyspoyle
his fellow is dyspoyled hym^self. And of such is veryfyed the holy scripture
ye says Ue qui predaris nonne et tu predaberis ipse. That is to say / cursed
player that robs the other shall thou not be robbed. There is diverse that
has played their wives gowns and kyrtylles / and other good Iewelles that
they might get. And would have played more if they might have gotten more / in
which they have not less sinned. Because that god looks not alonely at the
work of the sinner / but at the will of ye sinner the which is reputed for the
deed. And therefore as unto god that knows the hertes and voluptuous wyl^les
reputeth it for rapyne. Unde.xiiij.q.v.c. Si quis. is said that god interrogeth
not alonely the hand but y^ heart. The third spear is vsurye right great /
for it abides not a year nor a half / nor a month / nor also a hole day. if
one receive for a hundred nobles that he has lent / a hundred and.x. or
a.C.v. at the years end is said and reputed an usurer. What shall one say of
him that gothe to play with ten nobles / and in playnge receives thyrty that
same day. Certainly it appears that it is a great vsurye. For the which he
may not reteyne it for him / but is holden to restore it in certain things /
or give it unto poor folks as it shall be declared. And if he lose he ought
to take him to himself and to his folly / an usurer says Crysostome is cursed
above all the other. Sometime at the play one lenneth silver for to have
prouffyte / but they say it is but for to laughe / how well that it is a great
sin as toward god. Of this we have the decretall of excessibus prelatorum /
y^ begins. Inter dilectos / where as is made mencyon how the (...)
condemned a man of ye church that lent.xi. peits at the play for to have
twelve. and was iuged an usurer / it is not a little sin.

The fourth is multitudo mendacioru^ pernisiorum At the plays is many
lesynges and specially mortal For to deceive and begyle his next fellow.
Players have no conscience. Unde ambrosius. Et haber^.xx.ij. q.v. the chapitre.
Cauete. Omnes qui dicunt mendacium filij su^t diaboli. All they says he that
tells lesynges are the children of the devil. And to the end that they
believe the better their lesinges they conferme the^ by oaths. And in that wise
they are forsworn. ye which is always deedly sin / at ye leest when they
swear voluntaryly. For sometime they swear against truth by god by my faith.
etc. there is as much and as of ten in reckoning of their game. And all this
it behooves to tell at the article of the death / and at the judgment of god
euenso as it is written mathei.xij. de om^i verbo ocioso quod locuti fuerint
homines reddent racionem in die iudicij. If it be so that we must yield
account of the pronounced words / what shall it be of the lesynges / swerynges
/ blasphemynges / of mockynges detraccyons / and so forth of the other. And
more over not alonely they yt play tells lesynges / but also they that
behold them. As in the place of the tenysplay there shall be well a hundred
persons during the euensonge and sermon. And god vnoweth how many lesinges /
detraccyons / swerynges and blasphemynges there is said and done / they are
innumerable. And ye players shall say it is above the cord / another shall
say I report me unto such one. And they shall judge wrong sometime for hate /
or for couetyse because that they have waged on their hedes. It is no meruayl
if y^ players dampne them / for oftentimes they that beholds them offends
god the creator / alonely in so much as they lose the time / and becomes
necligent and slothful in good operacions / and will go to the tavern. The
fyfth spear dicitur fons blasphemy atque perni^riorum. It is the fountain of
al blasphemes and of al forswerynges. In none excercite is god blasphemed so
much and all ye court celestyall as in these plays diaboliques. O how many
and what blasphemes yssueth out of the cursed players against god / the blessed
vyrgyn Marye and all the saints of paradyse. The which sin is not alonely
mortell / but so horrible and so grievous that god has commanded in the law
in the xxiiij. chapter of leuitiq^. Who someuer blasphemeth says he the name
of god let him be put to death / as to the body death corporel / and as of the
soul if he do not penance death infernal* And sometime against such folks
god has made horrible Iugementes. For oftentimes the eyes of the miserable
and cursed players are issued out of their hedes and fallen upon the table.
Sometime tormented and posseded of ye devil of hell. Sometime the mouth turned
arseuerse / and other like. And for all that the good Ihesus complayneth him
and says. Nomen meum iugiter blasphemar. That is for to say my name is
contynually blasphemed. Who that will know the greuousnes of ye sin of
blasphemynge he needs not but for to behold the punycyon that is ordained of
our mother holy church agyenst the^ in the chapter statuimus. extra de
maledicis. Alas also / how many other works execrable and horrible proceeds
of such plays. Sometime the cursed players beteth and breketh the images of
our redemptour / of the blyssed vyrgyn Marye / and of the other saints / cry
/ yell / despise / reproach / fight and murdre the one ye other. By the things
above said play may be called heresy for asmoche as it is an art / or a work
by the which they that excercyse it fall in to foul and abhomynable sins.
Thou will say that the tenysplaye is lycyte. Certainly god is there
meruaylously and right often blasphemed as every body knows. And ye most
gretest lords and rich men are the most gretest blasphemers and swerers.
Good christian men that loves well their salute and health should be right sorry
if they were constrained for to abide in a tenysplaye / or serve and fournysshe
them of balls. if thou say I win my living. Saint Austen answers the. The
wynnyng is in thy co^fre / but the do^mage is in thy conscience and therefore
they ought to take away tenysplayes and boulynge alees. For who that would take
away the fountaynes the chanelles should not run. The closshebankes /
boulyng alees / tenysplayes / and other semblables is ye boucheryes where as is
dysmembred ye precious body of the blyssed sone of the vyrgyn Marye and his
precious blood shed. And therefore such p^ayers blasphemers are wors than the
Jews that has crucyfyed our lord / for at y^ lest they left y^ body ho^e
But these here breketh it and pulls it in pyeces. They will say that keeps
such plays / houses / and places of sin y^ they are not cause of the
euylles that is committed. I demand the thou that holds a tenysplay /
parauenture thou has.xx. year to keep it / and is certain that god shall be
blasphemed during that term one only time. Tell me in conscience if thou
may ryghtwylly keep the said play. I believe if thou be a good cryuen man that
thou shall answer that for to win al y^ gods of the world thou would not
p^^met that god were blasphemed in thy house. And for all that thou art well
certain y^ not alonely during this.xx. year / but or it be a month passed he
shall be blasphemed more tha^ xxx. times. Thou will say y^ thou knows
nothing thereof / and yet thou sees it by experyence every day. For the which
the phylosophre says. Quicquio v^get s^su non indiget probatione. It is no
necessyte to prove that / that is seen with the eye. But and it were defended
that they should not play during the dyuyne service / that is during the
mass / matyns / euensonge / and the sermon. Secondly yt they should not play
by avarice and couetyse to win / but alonely for the dinner or souper the one
of the other / and by recreacyon. Thyrdly if it happened any for to swear /
blaspheme / or despise god or his saints that he were incontinent accused unto
the justice for to make the punycyon. These three things here well observed and
kept / it should be another thing. But so as they use it / it is a play and
work dyabolyque.

The.vj. spear is corrupcion and marrynge of youth Will ye well break and
corrumpe a young person send him unto the plays / be they also well ordained
as you would / verytably they shall be changed and become evil and dysobedyent
unto god / and rebels against their friends. prime ad corinthios
quintodecimo. Corru^punt bonos mores colloquia praua. Super quod bernardus.
Qua^tomagis ergo opera praua. Says my lord saint Paul the evil words
corrumpeth ye good condycyons. By more stronger reason says saint Bernardyn
/ the evil works. And therefore it is written.vj. questione prima. in the
chapter ex merito.. Deteriores sunt qui vitam moresque bonorum corrumpu^t his
qui substantias aliorum prediaque diripiunt. Thou would think great conscience
for to go stele.xx. nobles out of ye coffre of thy neighbor. Be sure that
thou do the more greter ill without comparyson when by thy plays and evil
examples thou art cause to corrumpe the good condycyons and life spyrytuell of
them that beholds the play.

The seventh spear is scandalum virorum iustorum. It is sclaundre by the which
good folks are ill edyfyed of players and are dyssolute / dyspleasaunt / and
stired to evil. This vice is as sickness contagyous / for when one sees
another play where as he thought not for to play / he is incyted and styred
for to play as the other. And in the self wise when the children are inclyned
for to ensue and follow the meurs and condycyons of their kynnesmen / in seeing
their fader play / blaspheme / cry / and do other euilles that proceeds of
the play / without refraynynge they custom them in things semblable. And
thus the fader do^mageth his children / servants / and other by his evil
example in playnge. Know yt it is not a small thing for to sclau^dre his
neighbor / nor a little sin / for our lord says. Mathei decimo octauo.
Qui scandalizauerit vnu^ de pusillis istis qui in me credunt expedit ei vt
suspendatur molla asinaria in collo eius et demergatur in profundum maris.
Says our lord. It shall not be so great hurt miserable that gives evil
examples to other if one put a mylstone about thy neck and cast the into the
depest of the sea as it is to sclaundre and give occasyons of sin by evil
works and evil examples to them that byleueth in me. Sometime the mother seeing
her sone a player and a ryottour she shall be dyspleasaunt unto the death / and
shall say I am well unhappy and miserable to have such a child that goth in
to hell Ueryly it is so / and gothe with all the deuylles where as perpetually
he shall be beten and tormented And all the players if they do not penance
and leave these plays dyabolyques. Thou says yt it is nothyn for to sclaundre
the simple folks / here yet what our lord and redemptour Jesus christ says Ue
homini illi per quem scandalu^ venit. Certainly says our lord. Maledyccyon
be given to him by the which comes sclau^dre. O cursed and unhappy player I
demand the if thou did make a hole upon the bridge / or upon some other
peryllous and dangerous passage / and ye first man or woman the which shall
pass thereby by case of adventure falls therein in to the said ryuere or water
/ should thou not be cause of his evil / and worthy of great punycyon only
after ye legystes. Now answer / which is greter evil to make a body fall in
to the river or be cause to make him fall in the peril of his soul. It is
euydent and manifest that the second is ye most gretest evil. And therefore
leave these plays cursed and dampnable and put pain to redyfye by good works
those and them that by your sclaundre have been ill edyfyed. The eight spear is
conte^ptus matris ecclesie seu inobedientia. These hasardours and cursed
players are inobedyent to our mother holy church ye which defends the play
at the tables / not alonely to the men of ye church / but also unto the lay
people / in such manner y^ when he is correct if he amend him not he ought to
be cursed / even so as it is written in the decrete in ye chapter. Episcopus.
in the.xxxv. dystynccyon that is taken in the canon of ye appostles where as it
is said. Episcopus aut presbiter aut diaconus alee aut ebrietati deseruiens aut
desinat aut certe dampnetur. Subdiaconus autem aut lector aut cantor similia
faciens aut desinat aut communione priuetur similiter et laicus hec ibide^ in
forma. That is for to say a bishop or a priest or a deken that contynueth at
the play of the tables / cards / or dyce or riot if he leave not such plays
he ought to be deposed if he be subdeke^ / lectour / or synger / or a lay man
he must cease also or else be cursed / these are the propre words in the
place declared. And ye must note pryncypally these words apposed in the said
canon. Scilicet deseruiens desinat dampnetur and co^munione priuetur. For by
the first word that is said deseruie^s is given us to understand that if they
be not accustomed they shall not bear the said pain after the gloss. / How
well yt they sin mortally in playnge as says master Raymon / and master
Anthony of Florence / in his sum says that how well that some has wylled to
say that it is no mortal sin to play save wha^ they accustom them / which
is not true. For how well says he that the custom greueth the sin / for all
yt it meueth not the spyce or gendre of sin. For it makes not of a sin
venyall a sin mortal as says saint Thomas. As the sin of dronkennes / to
the which ye play is compared as unto the said pain / the which is deed^y
sin for to committee it one time wyttyngly / how be it yt he has not yet the
pain / save when one is accustomed for to be dronken and use the same. By ye
second word scilicet desinat is given us to understand that how well that he
is accustomed for to play he ought to be admonested / and after yt he has been warned if he will cesse he shall eschew the pain. But he ought to do
penance for the sin that he has done in playnge. By the other words
dampne^ur and co^munione priuetur / is given us to understand ye playnge at
the plays above said is deedly sin and well grievous. One may prove it in this
manner / none may be deposed or cursed save for deedly sin. By the chapter.
Nemo episcoporum.xi.q.iij. Now it is so yt the player at the tables ought to be
deposed or accursed after the canon above said. Ergo it follows that it is
deedly sin / seeing also that such play is defended in likewise by the law
cyuile / and laws of the paynyms and infydeles. As it appears in the dygestes
in the title of alee lusu and aleatoribus. And sith by new constytucyon made
by the emperor Iustynyan the which begins. Alearu^ vsus written in code in
the end of the rubrysshe of religiosis et su^ptibus funeru^. And not content
with this defends it yet again in the volume and book of autentyques in the
title of sanctissimis episcopis at the paragraphe interdicimus in the.ix.
collacyon / and that is also put and alegged in the said code in the title of
episcopis et cle. And begins also ye said autentyque interdicimus where as
it is textually defended not for to play / and not to be partaker of the play
/ and that more is for to behold play. It is semblably defended by the droyt
canon and holy decrete in diverse passages. And in likewise in the chapter
clerici officia. at the paragraphe. Ad aleas et taxillos non ludant nec
huiusmodi ludis intersint de vita and honestate clericorum in antiquis. And
upon this paas is to be noted after the doctors that the play of tables may
be called all game that is joined and subgecte to fortune pryncypally. How well
that it is meddled with craft as the play of dyce and the play of cards / and
other like. And therefore the text in the said autentyque interdicimus / uses
of this term and word. tabulas / and the other droyts above alegged of this
word alea. Note that our lord says in the gospel luce decimo. Qui vos
spernit scilicet prelatos ecclesie in suis ordinationibus me spernit. Says
our lord in speaking to his dyscyples and to their successors / they yt
which myspryseth you that is for to say the prelates of the church in their
ordeynau^ces / they myspryse me and conte^pneth / What is it for to myspryse
and contempne ye commau^deme^tes of our mother holy church. Certainly it is a
great sin as it appears clerly in the holy decrete Si qui lxxxi.
distinctione vbi dicit gregorius. Paganitatis peccatum incurrit quisquis dum
cristianum se esse asserit sedi appostolice obedire contemnit. Says saint
gregory yt in every body renneth ye sin of a paynim wha^ he says he is
christian not obeyenge the church.

The.ix. spear is perditio temporis. That is that the players leseth their time
inutylly and all the goods yt they might do. How well that diverse ryottours not
carynge for their salute make not great estymacyon. For all that the prudentes
that beholds the evil yt is done / and the wealth that is left undone /
has thereof great conscience / and such manner of folk consydereth not ye
valor of the time / the shortness of it irreuocable. The precyousnes of the
time is so great that in little space a man may have remyssyon of his sins /
purchase ye grace of god / and acquyre the glory of paradyse. And therefore
says seneca. Nulla mayor iactura quam temporis amissio nam recuperari non
potest. In the world said he is not so great dommage as the lesynge of the
time / for asmoche as it may not be recovered. Ha pore and miserable sinner
affusked how shalt thou yield accountes of the time that god has lent and
given the for to do penance and good works. The which thou haste euylly
employed in serving ye devil of hell as well on the day as on the night
festes and holidays. Certainly thou shalt answer therefore grievously. For as
says saint bernarde. Om^e te^pus tibi impe^su^ reqirer^ a te q^liter sit
expe^su^. and yet. quam sicut nec capillus de capite. sic nec momentu^ peribit
de tempore de quo scilicet non oporteat reddere ratione^. this puts he here.
That is for to say that we must yield accountes of ye time yt has been given
us in this world here. Job ye holy man considering this / and how the men
abusyng them of ye time that is ^ente them for to save their souls said in
weeping. Sedit homini locum penitencie et ipse abutitur eo in superbiam. Job
viceumoquarto. God says he has given unto the man the time present / not
for to play and lose it vycyously / but for to do penance. And he wastes it
in pride / invanyte and in all sins. Item these folks think not on the
shortenes of the time of this present life. Of the which Job speaks
quartodecimo capitulo. Breues dies hominis sunt. The days of man are short
and sone passed. Certainly they are right short / for when we shall be at ye
death it shall seem us to have lived less than an instant And therefore says
saint Austyn. Omnia te^pora eternitati comparata quan punctus sunt. All the
time since the beginning of the world till unto the end compared to the
eternyte that we shall have after this life present is but one point. Item they
consider not also yt the time passed is irreuocable and shall never return. O
if ye unhappy dampened and reproved sinners might recover one hour of their
time lost after that they have talled and felt the right horrible /
intolerable / and eternal pains of hell from which they shall never
depart. What dylygence thynkest thou that they would make to think on their
sins / to testefye them / and confess them / and to cry mercy / and for to
reconsyle them unto god in purpose to be sooner casten in to a furneyse
brennynge / than ever to return to play defended / or return to sin. But
as says the proverb. Foles do not bileue / till they receive grieve. And
therefore after the doctrine of saint poule ad gala.ii. Operemur bonum non dicit
ludum dum tempus habemus. Make we said he good works / he said not play we at
the cards whiles that we have the time. Thou says that thou must pass the
time. Alas ye dampened that are in hell wherewith pass they the time. Certainly
to bayne them within the furneyse of fire of hell. Think that and ye souls
of purgatory were in this life how they would occupy ye time in weeping their
sins and doing penance. We take no regard thereto wherefore ill shall come
to us.

The.x. spear is frauds et falsitates. Commonly there is but frauds and
deceytes in these cursed plays. Jeremy nono. Loquitur pacem cum proximo and
in occulto ponit insidias. They shall say play we truly. But in their hertes
they have will for to begyle each other in hydynge the cards / in casting
away the dyce / in reckoning / in gyuynge false money the which is mortal
sin. As it is said extra de furtis et vicesima quinta distinctione in ye
chapter vnum orarium propterea ieremias dicit vnusquisque a proximo suo se
custodiat. ye prophet Ieremye says every body beware of his neighbor and
have no trust in his brother. For at this day the fader will begyle the sone /
and the mother the fader / and so consequently of the other.

The.xi. spear sunt ire et rixe. It is noyses and debates. one shall say such
one has won my money / shall I never love him / he is cause that I am a
poor man. And reproaches so many that it is meruayll with noyses that of it
proceeds. Sometime they shall pull them-demaunded forgyuenes of our lord / and
did so much by wepynges and lamentacions yt he found mercy anenst god / and
was delivered from the enemy. And then incontinent he came unto ye priest
that saw these three things by experyence as he recou^ted to ye said saint
Bernardyn / in many festynge and declarynge ye case as it was happened him. And
in witness thereof he showed him his sholdres grievously wounded / and his
confession herd deyed two days after. In this manner diverse have fallen in
dyspayre.

The.xiij. is adoratio stulta. This is a folysshe adoracyon / for the player
makes of the play his god / in so much as he has lever lose the grace of
god than to leave playenge. And often for the love that he has to play he is
content to transgress the commandments of god. For as says my lord
saint Austyn in the book named de doctrina cristiana. Illud ab homine colitur
quod preceteris diligitur. That is for to say yt the which thou loves most
/ and to whom thou obeys soueraynly thou makes it thy god. The dyce says
wha^ thou plays that thou have lost / pay / leave thy money with such one /
and thou does it. And in likewise of cards when thou leseth thou pays. I
demand the if thou obey unto god so lyberally. God byddeth the yt thou make
restytucyon of that which thou has of others / that thou give alms to the
poor / and thou do the nothing. Will ye know the great folly of ye players /
and how promptly they obey to the dyce and to ye cards their ydolles. The
blyssed saint Martyn that was right lyberal for the love of god gave but half
of his mauntell. But the cursed players gives it hole for the dyce and the
cards. And sometime gown and doblet / and to the end that he be known that
he is of ye lyueray of the devil he gothe all naked as his master that is all
naked. And that wors is he gives often y^ y^ is not his / for he boroweth by
vsurye that ye which he has not / and robs his neighbor / and more over
one may know how the players are foles and vnwytty. For as it is thus that the
understanding of ye man is right noble / for all he submytteth him to obey to
the bone of a dog / and believe his judgment. And notwtstandynge he would not
believe the sentence of Iohan-Andrewe / or some other well famed doctors without
appellacyon / as he does at the sentence of his judge the dyce / or ye cards /
which sees not / hereth not / nor speaks not. And yet he does more gretter
honor to three dyce / or to a pair of cards than he does to the humanyte of
our lord / for often at the play he is usurped and blasphemed. And therefore
our lord in complaining him of the players says in this manner by the mouth
of the prophet royal Dauyd. Foderunt manus meas et pedes meos. etc. They have
perced my fete and my hands / and have put me in such estate that one may
tell al my rybbes and bones. Note poor miserable player if thou were a good
christian man when there should be nothing else to withdraw the from such
play save only the gown of thy redemptoure that was played at the game of
sort as it is written. Supervestem meam miserunt sortem. / it should be a
suffycyent cause to absteyne you from such plays / and to have abhomynacyon
to play / make / sell / or bye dyce and cards / or other like.

The fourtynth spear is ocij nutrimentum. That is nourysshynge of vnlustynes /
under the vmbre too be not vacabunde. if a man will be perfytely unthrifty ye
need not but to put him to follow the plays / for sithe ever after he shall be
unthrifty at ye work / you se it by ye experyence of diverse / they can not
abide half a day at work. Semblably of the children that will not learn no
craft. Osyuyte is tho that diverse have but little conscience of after saint
Bernarde nutrix viciorum et totius inimica virtutis. The plays are ye
nourysshynge of slouthfulnes and enemy of all virtues as it is written in
ye.xij. chapter of ye proverbs. He is right folysh ye follows slouthfulnes /
and in ezechiel in the.xvj. chapter. The cause of the iniquyte of Sodom was
pride / glotony / auaryce / and slouthe / as rote of all the euylles that is
proceeded.

The.xv. and last spear is turpis et infamisvita. This life is vile and
abhomynable. For they that accustom them for to play becomes dronkerdes and
harlottes and have no cure of their wives nor of their children And shortly
they are in the indygnacyon of god and opprobyte of the men as says the
psalmyste. Opprobrium hominum and abiectio plebis And consequently they do
against the first commandment of droyt. That is for to wit to live honestly
without hurtynge of other / in yeldynge unto his neighbor and even christian
that the which apperteyneth to them. As byddeth ye droyt vulgaryes.

THe prophet after that he has said odiui ecclesiam malignantium it follows
cum impiis no^ fedebo. That is for to say I shall not set me with the evil /
or men without pity. When the men are assembled for to do some good god is in
the mids of them And when they are assembled for some evil god is not there
but the devil of hell. The players commonly are not assembled save for evil
intencyon / and also the devil governs them and helps them to fight wtoute
pity against our redemptour. For there is found but few palyes there as our
lord is not offended / and ye mortally / or at the leest venyally. And right
often that the which is mortell we repute often for venyall. And also the
contrary. And for the venyel one shall be tormented in the fire of purgatory.
Uenyell sin dysposeth to mortal and dymynyssheth hete in the body. For all
that it puts him not out of the charity of god. And ryally there is so much
sin committed at the play that one may well say that it is a dyspraysynge
of Ihesu crist And when there should be none other sin but vayn swerynge and
blasphemynge yet is it a great thing / For in as much as is in the
blasphemers they crucefye our redemptour and puts him to death. And for this
third mystery we have to behold which are ye folk that dampneth them by ye
plays above said. Answers my lord saint Bernardin that there is.xij manner
of folks / that is for to wit.

Their faders and moders.

The players. Their wives and children. They that gives the houses for to
play They that make / sell / or bye / give / or lenne the dyce / the cards /
the tables / or other plays. They that serve the players or give them either
fire or candell. They that beholds them. They that lenne them money for to
play. The Iuges and prelates that suffers them and might et them.
The first are ye unhappy players that are in ye first place and offends god
mortally / and dampneth their souls when they play at any play defended / as
the play of dyce / of cards / of tables. and other plays of chance and
hasarde. Secondly when god is offended by swerynge / lesynges / blasphemes and
so of other. Thyrdly when they play by auaryce and couetyse to win. /
Fourthly when they observe not the time / as when yt they say the mass /
sermon / or the euensonge / or yt they play or dance in holy ground / they
think to win and leseth much. And if the players will make due penance they
are bounden to two things. First to confess their sins and purpose never to
return again Secondly they are bounden to make restytucyon of all that which
they have won at these cursed plays. / And that it is true we shall put ten
witnesses worthy of credence and believe / that is for to wit Astexanus libro
quinto.ti.xxx. Master Johan of Gerson in his preceptorye upon this passage.
Non furtu^ facies. master Ambrose sphyera in his quadragesimal of the flower
of sapyence / master Johan co^sobrim white freer in his treatye of Justice
commutatiue. Innocent. Hostiense Raymon master Nycole de lyre / saint
Bernardyn / and master Richard of meiuille in his quarte in the
dystinction.xv. in. the.v. article / the questyon.vj. The which doctors
says that the play of dyce / and of cards and other semblables are in such
wise defended yt that which they win is unjustly gotten / and yt they may
not with hold it. This proves master Nycole de lyre upon these words non
furtu^ facies. Thou shalt make no theft / and says that the reason therefore
y^ none may with hold that yt he has won at ye play is for the play of
the dyce / of ye cards / and of ye tables is defended and forboden by the
laws and by ye droitz written. And therefore in things so won one must have
good title / good faith / and just cause. Which are the three things
necessary in the same who that will have right and possede any good temporell.
This confermeth master Johan Gerson in exposynge the.vij. commandment of god
/ and says in this manner. Against this commandment thou shall committee no
theft. they and those sin that by playnge at the dyce / car^des / tables /
or other plays forboden win ye goods of other and reteyneth them. For one
may not by right witholde that which he has won at those plays But
behooves to restore it again to him that he has wo^ne it of / or give it to
the poor folk after the most common oppynyon And we must dystyngue it after
the said doctoure. For if thou have won of any that are not able to help
themself / as is ydyottes / unreasonable men / children not of great age /
unthrifty / relygious wedded women / servants / men of the church yt plays
the goods of poor folks and other like / or if you have induced and tyced any
for couetyse of winning or if thou haste begyled any in playnge in gyuyng
false dyce / false cards / or mysrekenynge. In these cases thou art bounden
to restore unto them that which y^ have won / and ought not to make none
alms / but yield it unto them. But if any that has puyssau^ce for to
forbere it that has lost at play / and that thou have won it without
fraud or decepcion / thou art not holden to restore it him. For he that has
lost it is not worthy to receive it. And that notwithstanding thou can not
witholde it with right. But ought for to depart it unto the poor people. And so
should the wynner put the gaynes in his purse / for otherwise it is against ye
commandment of god. non furtum facies. These things says master Johan
Gerson. But how is ye vnderstonden that it ought to be given to the poor folk
Shall the player say I wanne yesterdaye ten shelynges and to day I returned
and have lost ten. For to wit if I am holden for to give unto the poor folk
yt the which I had won yesterdaye / how well that to day I have lost it.
Says the doctors that ye. For thou may not play the goods of the poor
folk / it is not thine. For conclusyon always ye player leseth his time his
soul and his temporal goods / wherefore keep them therfro that will.

The second that dampneth them by the plays are the kynnesmen of the players.
As the fader and the mother ^ the master ye maystresse ^ and pryncipally for
three reasons. The first is when they chastyse them not as they ought and are
holden ^ and therefore they are ye cause of the evil yt they do. Secondly when
they are party fellows at the play. It happens oftentimes that the mother and
her children are nourysshed with the winnynge of the plays and is culpable of
the sin / for they set them on work to the end that they make good chere.
And such manner of folks is bounden to make restytucyon of yt which they have
received / as it is written in the decretall de iniurus and damno dato in ye
chapter. Si culpa.

The third reason when they are impatient. Diverse times thou shalt se that
the kynnesmen is so replete with vnpacyence that they curse them and give them
unto the devil / and swereth and blasphemeth / and angreth them against their
children that is players / Not for ye love of god / nor for the salute of their
souls. But because they waste and dystroye the goods of ye house. And so they
fall in vnpacyence and desires the dethes of their children and theyrs also /
which is clean against the commandment of god.

The third that dampneth them by the plays are the wives and their children.
First when they part of the prouffyte of the play / and restores it not.
Right often the wife shall bear a pledge for to make good chere on / which
ought not to be done. For it is comen of deuyllyshnesse / if she had not great
necessyte. Secondly when they are impatient. For diverse curses ye hour and
the day that they were married on. And oftentimes becomes noughtypackes for
the play of their husbands. And thyrdly when the children play by ye example
of their fader and mother / specially when the play is holden in their house.
In like wise ye daughters becomes harlottes. When they play in a house / I
demand the what manner of folk are they that resorteth theder. None but
knaves and ryottours / which shall speak of rybaudrye whiles the other plays
/ And ye maidens that are great ye spynneth on their rocks beside them shall
here all this. And there shall be made diverse dyshonest and vyllayne approchynges
and occasyons of innumerable sins. I speak not of ye maystres of the house.
Certainly they shall come often in to thy house under the color of waygynge /
but it shall be to deceive thy wife. For they shall abide drynkyng and playnge
unto mydnyght / and then they will say it is to late to go unto their lodgings
let us have a chamber / and all the night god wot what they do. Thou
knows not all / if thou be wise take good keep that of thy house be not made
the church of ye devil And know for a truth that there is diverse y^ cares
not for to lose their money to the end that they may come unto their
enterprise.

The fourth are they that gives the houses / the places / the courts there as
is made the plays. As tenys plays / and closhbankes / such houses byeth our
great masters / for they have more gretter rentes because of the plays that
is made there says saint Bernardin It seems me that one may not find
prouffyte in the place that is so full of iniquytes. How is it that the
burgeyses wynneth / in lettynge forth their houses there as is excercysed
these plays dyabolyques. And that ye causes the merchants to win in
selling the dyce and the cards ye tables and other plays. For they are
partakers of all the euylles that follows. Because that they give cause and
place for to commytte y^ sin in of the which they must yield accouncte
before god And al they also the which keeps sellers where as is playng at the
dice and cards erly and late at al times to the end for to sell their drink
/ or to have some gaynes. And for to understand ye great ill that it is to
suffer playenge in their houses it behooves to look ye first law in the title
above alegged de alee lusu et alcatoribus. in the old digeste where as is thus
said. Si quis illum verberauerit in cuius hospitio lusum est in alea. vel si
dolo aliquid subtractum fuerit iudicium ei non datur. This law that is made by
a paynym to the detestacyon of the play says that when a person holds
players in his house / if it happened yt the mean while that the players is in
his house yt he be beten or hurt or that his money be stolen out of his coffre
or other gods / and yt he complain unto ye Justice / this law says that
the Judge shall give him none audyence. because of the detestacyon of his sin.
What shall we say of them that holds the plays in his house. Of ye which
follows so many euylles and scandales. And sometime gothe for to fetch the
players for to play all the night. They play not against their will / for
they may put them out. It should be another thing of an ho^tel er that
lodges men of arms / and the kings servants / to whom they dare not bydde
goo out for fere of betyng. But his wife may speak hardely / for they will be
ashamed to smite her. And therefore among you wives if you be good christian
women you ought for to cry and rather chese to deye than to suffer that god be
offended in your houses when you may let it. For a good child may not suffer
that his fader be wronged in his propre house. In some place of this realm was
a gentylman that led a harlot in to a house that he had letten to a crafty
man. When this man saw this harlot he said unto ye gentylman / my lord if it
please you / ye shall have her out of this house. For if you do not I promise you
by my faith that I shall put the fire in ye house. And thus the lord was
constrained to put her out. But what shall we say of diverse / they desire not
that their houses be burnt / for they have prouffyte and the grace of the
lord. ye but for all that they are in the indygnacyon of god the creatoure.
Tell me what prouffyteth it the to be in the grace of this lord that is a
rybaude / harlot / and thief. If thou be in his grace it may be that thy wife
is his hoar for all retrybucyon.

The fyfth yt do dampne them by the plays are they that make the dyce / sell /
bye / give or lenne.

The syxte are they that make the cards / that sell the^ bye them / give them /
or lenne them.

The seventh are they that make the tables / sell / bye / give / or lenne.

The.viij: are they that make the berlans / tho ye selle them bye them / give
them / or lenne them / tho y^ gives the stuff for to make them. As the bones
/ the paper / ye colors / the moules / and things like. All these here are
cause of the euylles / blasphemes / sclaundres / and unhappiness that follows /
and shall yield accountes at the Judgment of god. For as says the doctors.
and amongst the other master Anthony of Florence. part secu^da titulo primo
capitulo vigesimo tertio. Saint Bernardyn in the treatye that he has made of
the relygyon christian master Ange of clauasio in his sum in vocabulo ars
master Henry herp in exposynge the commandments of god. The sum of rosell
invocabulo negociatio de floribus sapientie sermon tricesimo quinto. Such
manner of folk is not in the estate of grace but dampneth their souls. And
that more is they may not be assoyled but if they leave their crafts. De
penitentia distinctione quinta / the chapter falsas the chapter fratres / and
the chapter negocium. And they ought to deny them the body of our lord
Ihesu christ as they do in Almayne / and in the cite of Myllan For when Ester
day comes they are expulsed and cast out of the church as the common
harlottes of the bordel And after when they are deed they are sent in to ye
fylthy donghyll / and there is buried with the horses and caryen. There is some
that says / if I knew yt it were deedly sin for to make / sell / or bye
the dyce and the cards for nothing would I meddle therewith. Understande what
our lord says. In ore duorum vel trium stat omne verbum. That is for to say
one ought to believe the wytnes of two or three. I ask the if thou yede thyrty
or forty mile far and that thou came to the entering of a wodde finding
there a little shepeherde y^ said unto the / my friend pass not through the
wodde wherefore good sone / for because that there is four murderers yt even
now has cut the throat of a merchant or twain. Tell me truth would you
pass forth / pass / I shall keep me well therfro. And how tho it is but a
little shepeherde that has told it the / in effect you shall say for all
that I will not put me in danger. Now if it be so that thou believe a little
shepeherde for thy life corporal wherefore than byleueth thou not so many
notable and holy doctors and prechers the which shows and declares the the
salute and health of thy soul / and thou to be so neclygent to put it in
forgetynge. / And for to declare this matter more largely we shall take a
preposycyon that is written in the pystyll that my lord saint Poule sent unto
the Romans / where as he says. Prouidentes bona non solum coram deo sed
etiam coram omnibus hominibus. ad to.xij. That is to say yt for to have
paradyse it suffyseth not to be good before god / but to do good works
before the people. Upon the which words say we one preposycion general and
note it for it touches every estate / and specially them that meddle with dyce
and cards. I believe if you understand it well you shall know the great
perils that you are in / and the evil that you do. The preposycyon is such.
Every body that has desire for to deye well and that has will for to come
unto ye glory of paradise is holden and bounden upon the pain of mortal sin
to live so virtuously that it give none occasion nor knowledge to his christian
brother to offend god mortally. Prouide^tes bona non solum coram deo sed etiam
coram omnibus hominibus. One might speak here to the baudes yt steleth the
souls of Ihesu crist from faders and moders / masters or maistresses that
shows evil examples to their meyne / to the tayllers that makes the
dyssolute garments / to ye crafty men that shows their children and
servants to make frauds and deceytes / and makes them work on the holy
days. But come we unto them that medleth them to make dyce and cards. I
pray you tell me by your conscience if a boy or a ryottour bye a pair of
cards of you or a pair of dyce is it not wyttyngly matter for to offend god
mortally / it is manyfeste. If you say that you can not tell the experyence
shows it openly at ye eye the great euylles and horrible blasphemes and
sins innumerable that is comytted every day. In such manner that if you were
by them sometime till mydnyght and wrote all the words y^ yssueth out of their
cursed mouths / you would say that with great pain the devil might find so
many. Who is cause. It is ye cards that thou haste sold. Now ymagyne how many
souls is dampened in hell for the dyce and for ye cards that has been made at
Paris / at Lion / at Roen / and in other places. And think you not that it
cries vengeance to god the creatoure against them that is cause of their
dampnacyon / certainly yes. Will ye know perfytely ye evil that follows of
dyce and cards Our lord answers. A fructibus eorum cognoscetis eos. you
shall know them by the fruit that they bear One knows not the bounte or
malice of a tree by the branches or leaves / but by the fruit yt it bears.
Now take we two trees. The first shall be a harlot the which has been in a
chamber by the space of.xx. year committing her lecherye with her rybaude. And
ye other tree shall be a maker of cards or dice / or tables / and other
instruments of play of chance / the which since xx. year hetherwarde has
always made dyce and cards / now demand we our lord and redemptoure.
Lord god tell us if it please you of which of these two you have been most
offended / of the harlot / or of the dyce and cards made by this man here. I
believe if it pleased him for to speak yt he would say. A fructibus eorum
potestis cognoscere. you may know it shall our lord say by the fruit that
is issued therout. I will not compare the operacyon of this harlot to the
operacyon of this card maker / or maker of dyce / but the evil that is followed
/ and will prove that god has been more offended by the cards that has been
made in the house of this cardmaker / or dyce maker / tha^ of ye lechery of
this harlot for four reasons. The first for this wretchyd harlot has not
offended our lord but in her chamber where as she was present. But the
cardmaker / and maker of dyce is occasyon that our lord is offended / not
alonely in one house and one street: in one parisshe / but in all the town.
And not alonely in one town / but in Paris / in Roen / in Lion / and in all
France as well as here in this country / and through all crystendome far
and nere.

The second reason for this harlot offe^deth god but only in her life / but
the cardmaker and maker of dyce is occasyon that god is offended in his life in
his death and after his death. Note cardmaker and maker of dyce when thou
shalt be in the article of death and ye one shall hold the candell in thy
hand / and that the priest shall cry Ihesus my friend Ihesus / it may be that
some plays with the dyce or cards that thou have made and for asmoche as he
leseth his money in renyeng and blasphemynge god and brekynge the cards shall
say. All the deuylles of hell take the soul of him that has made these
dyce or cards. And perauenture he shall be a man of the church / or relygyous
/ or an abbot or a bishop.

The third reason is that this harlot offends god only when she waketh /
but this cardmaker / and maker of dyce are occasyon yt god is offended when
they wake / when they sleep / when they take their refeccyo^ when they are in
the church to pray god / and ye mean while the players gives him to the
devil and curses him. And right so as a good christian he may say unto god.
Particeps factus sum omnium timentiu^ te. Lord god I thank ye of that thou
makes me perteyner of all the goods that your servants makes. Se^blably he
that medleth him to make / sell / and bye ye dyce and the cards may say unto
the devil yt he is perteyner of all ye euylles and sins that is committed by
the players.

The fourth reason is that the lechery of this harlot has not ben occasyon
save only to make two persons too sin / she and her lemman. But the cards
of this cardmaker / and the dyce of this dyce maker have not ben only cause
that two persons has offended god / but.xx.xxx.xl.C.M.x. thousand.C.M. and
innumerable of all estates. For it is one of the gretest abusinges that
domyneth to day in crystendome.

There is diverse abusynges pertyculerly in all estates / as in the estate of
the church where as symony regneth / in relygyon propryete and inobedyence /
amongst the nobles rapyne / in justice pyllynge / scratchyng and fleing of
poor people / among ye burgeyses vsurye / auaryce / and inhumanyte / in
marchaundyse frauds and decepcyons / among the crafty men lesynges
forswerynges / brekynge of holidays and so of other. But there is an abuse
general y^ which touches every estate great and little / rich and poor /
whereof speaks the prophet zacharye octauo. That is ye abuse to play at the
dyce and cards from which proceeds so many euylles and sins that as the
doctoures says they transgress and break the.x. commandments of god /
they contemn the five commandments of holy church. By this blyndnes they
commytte the seven deedly sins / they adnychyll the seven gifts of ye holy
ghost. By this abuse they make irreuerence to ye holy sacrament of the church
/ they run in the indygnacyon of god. By this abuse comes often wars /
pestylences / famynes / and mortalytes / by this abuse they lose the realm of
paradyse and gothe unto dampnacion eternal. Now think how many souls there
is damned in hell for the abuse of playnge at the dyce and cards. And
generally all the euylles that may be thought proceeds and comes of this
abuse. I demand from whens comes at this day so many blasphemynges against
god and the blyssed vyrgyn Marye / and against all the saints of paradyse.

nere. Answers zacharye. Ciuitas replebitur hominibus lude^tibus. It is ye
abuse to play at the dyce and cards. And thus you se manyfestly that this
abusing makes horrible wou^des in crystendome / and how it is cause of the
perdyccyon not alonely of the goods temporell / but also of the bodies and
souls. What remedy / what is to be done / will not my lords of the church
and governors of the common welfare do for the love of their god / lord / and
judge sovereign / and for the welthe and prosperyte spyrytuell and corporel of
their subgectes as they are straytly bounden after ye dute of their estates and
offices / they ought for to lose both etynge drinking and slepynge for to
think and puruaye therefore / for it touches them right nere / and ought to
be right Joyous to find some mean to deiecte and hele this horrible
pestylence and abuse dampnable. Now understand if it please you / there is but
one thing as it is said in the decretall depenitentus et remissionibus in the
chapter. Cum infirmitas Remota causa remouetur effectus. Will you make an ill
tree for to dye in your garden / cut the rote of the same evil tree and it
shall bear no more ill fruit Will you take away all the euylles and sclaundres
of the which we have spoken / take away all the dyce and all the cards in
your cytes bourghs and towns and bre^ne them / for it is a general rule. A
destructione cause sequitur destruction effectus. ye must dystroye ye dyce and
the cards and the play shall cesse / and consequently the euylles that
follows. There is not he but that they know it. And it is that the which my
lord saint Poule says in the auctoryte above spoken. Prouidentes bona non
tamen coram deo s etia^ cora^ omnibus hominibus. That is for to say that for
to have paradyse it suffyseth not to be good before god / but also to do good
works and operacyons before the people for to show and teache them the right
way unto paradyse as they are bounden.

The.ix. that dampneth them for the plays are they that lenneth money to a
hasardoure for to play at the dyce or at the cards. One shall find sooner a
man that will lenne silver unto a ryottour or hasardoure / than they will do
unto a good man in his necessite / the which is an euydent and open sign that
they are the mynysters and servants of the devil. Shall a player say go we
to play. His fellow shall answer I have not a halfpeny. Take no thought shall
the other say I have enough for us both. And thus for ye devil he shall
sooner lenne ten nobles than he would do for the love of god ten shelynges to a
good man in his great necessite if he should deye for hongre. O how it is great
ill for to lenne money to the players.

The.x. that dampneth them by the plays are they that serves the players
gyuyng them fire and candel There is that serves the players all the night
being before them / and shall take sometime a noble for a candell / and yet the
tapster will not be ashamed to say yt it is for to marye her daughter. And ye
unhappy players shall let her take it with a good will / in saying within their
hertes / she will condyscende more sooner to our request / she shall let her be
kyssed and groped / or if yt she may not entende she shall send her great
daughter / lo here is a fair beginning for to be a good wife.

The.xj. yt dampneth them by plays are they yt abides for to behold ye
players / they do more gretter hurt than they wene / and believe that all the
blasphemynges / deceyuynges / lesynges / and other sins that is committed
there is transported to them that beholds them. For they prove ye games. How
is it possible that one may stand beside the fire without warmyng him And
therefore says the wise / ecclesiastici xiij. Qui tetigerit picem inquinabitur
ab ea. That is for to say / who that touches rosyn he shall be spotted or
maculed And says after. Qui communicate superbo induit superbiam. Who that
haunteth a proud man shall become proud also. I demand you says saint
Bernardyn who may behold them that co^mytteth actuelly the sin of lecherye
without being spotted with sin. What is he that doubts that he that
beholds ye players renneth not in more gretter sin than they that beholds
them that co^mytteth lecherye. How be it / it is so that they are parteyners of
all the sins that is done and committed there / as says saint Poule the
appostle. ad To. primo. Digni sunt morte non solu^ qui ea faciunt sed etiam qui
consentiunt facientibus. That is for to say that not alonely they that
co^mytteth ye sin are worthy death eternell / but also they that consent to
them that do the evil / for the prophet Dauyd says. Cum peruerso
peruerteris. With the evil says he you shalt become evil. Of this speaks
the holy scripture in the third chapter in ye book of Thobye / where as is
made mencyon of a good maiden / god will that there be many such ones / that
said in this manner. Nunquam cum ludentibus me miscui neque cum his qui in
leuita^te ambulant particitem me tribui. She was in great trybulacyon and
desolacyon this good vyrgyn. For unjustly they had done her a great reproach.
And even so as she should she put her in orayson to appease god and said. Lord
god I have done you this little service it is that I never meddled me with the
players Ha my lord god I have done this for the love of the I have not ben in
the daunces with the light maidens. It seemed her that she had done a great
service to god / and therefore that god should give her that which she
demanded / and also she obtained it. For she was married unto a good man the
sone of ye good Thobye. And at this day they vau^t them. Shall my burgeyse
say. It was I that they came for too fetch to the banquet. I have found
such a facyon of a gown I have worn it first I have found such a play /
and shall vaunt her / and the daughter shall say. My mother I am the first that
has song this song. O miserable thou reioyseth the of the evil that thou
has done / weep / weep / and demand pardon of god. Of the evil that they
do that beholds play the players / behold also that the which ye law
cyuyle. In predicta autentica interdicimus / here above aleggued. Which is
argument that such sins mortally / where as it is expressly defended to be
boty fellows with the players / and not to behold the^ play. And mark well
the punycyon that he ought to have after the said law that does the
contrary. He ought to be closed in a mynstre by the space of three year to do
penance. And if he have a benefyce he ought to be suspended from his benefyce.
Lo here an argument that they sin mortally / for / for sin venyell they
give not such penance. And this is confermed in ye said decretal. Clerici
officia. de vita et honestate clericorum that was made at the consyle general.
What shall we say of them that plays openly in ye street / and of them that
beholds them. But at this time we make no conscience thereof for asmoche as
there is no correcyon done. And right often they y^ play are the gretest / and
they that ought to chastyse the other. Alas we se every day that they the
which should be the example to live well to the simple folk / are the
spectacle of vnthryftynes. The.xij. that dampneth them by the plays are they
that might let them and have auctoryte to do it / as the prelates of the
church / the men of Justice / the governors of Cytees / the lords terryens /
and all they y^ by their offices or by their oaths are bounden for to punysshe
the open sinners. For ye which god punysshed a hole comynalte. And therefore it
was said and answered by the crucyfyxe to king Robert prayenge god at
orleaunce for the peace of his realm of France yt he should have none if he
chastysed not ye blasphemynges in especyall / and al other open sins of his
realm in general / as is found in the chronicles and stories. And
consequently ought to for do these players and take away the occasyons to
play sith that there proceeds so many euylles and sins / and if they labor
not to take them away they consent to ye evil. For it is written.lxxxv^.

deturbare peruersos nihil aliud est quam fouere: and proba^odisse seuicia qi
conde^nat errantes. We say meruaylles that we shall do none evil. Certainly
at ye hour that we shall punysshe the sins we shall show y^ we hate the
evil. But and we make dyssymulacyon / it is syne yt we give favor. It
follows in this chapter. Nichil prodest alicui non puniri proprio que
pumendus e^alieno peccato. Suppose yt thou art not a harlot / nor player what
shall that prouffyte yt if thou be dampened for the sin of other / as hely is
dampened for the sin of his children / for all that he was good himself / of
ye which speaks saint Iherome. Hely pro iniquitate filioru^ suorum damnatus
est corripuit qi de^ eos sed leuitate patris non auctoritate pontificis. hec
hieronimus. And to the end that this great good may issue in effect / and the
better to take away ye occasyons of playng I counsayl and require every body
that desires to be saved / and to give none occasyon to other for to sin nor
of dampnacyon / that has the dyce / the cards / and the tables / with other
plays / that you brenne / them in a fire / and sacryfye them to our lord. So
as they were deputed for to do sacryfyce unto the devil of hell / For god
commands in his law right so as it is written primi paralipomenon decimo
quarto. ca. et deutero nomij.vij. that the things that has been dedycate to
the devil of hell should be dystroyed and burnt with in the fire. And so
did the king Dauyd of the ydoles of the Phylystyns / how well that they were
of great valor. And if that you do so / the good lord for the fere love and
honor of whom you do it / he shall reward you well and not for that in so
doing I make you perteyners of all the messes that I shall sing hereafter Halas
none ought to be withdrawn from doing so good a work for three
consyderacyons. The first as unto god. The second as unto himself. The third
as unto his neighbor. The ^yrste consyderacyon as unto god is that even so as
god has been iniuryed with such instruments and openly offended by the great
dystruccyon of the same be the devil confounded and god honored as it is
written in the decretall. de penitentus et remissionibus. ca. primo. Manifesta
peccata non sunt occulta correctione purganda. That is for to say the sins
manifest ought to be punysshed openly The second consyderacyon as unto himself
is to the end that the occasyons to play which is the instruments of the
devil be taken away for so as we have said before. Remota causa remouetur
effectus. Take away the instruments and they shall play no more. And if you
will not bre^ne them it is sign that you are not contryte of your sins and
that you have no purpose to leave these plays dyabolyques. The third
consyderacyon is as unto his neighbor for even so as by the plays and sins
that has been committed by these instruments they have been sclau^dred and
dymynysshed / thus by the dystruccyon they shall be edyfyed and have the said
play in abhomynacyon. And take good keep that by auaryce and by the suggestyon
of the devil there abide none in your houses / and in like wise of the tables
that they be not converted in too some prouffytes of the house / as it is so
that a true penitent has not alonely abhomynacyon of his sins / but also of
all the things by whom the dyuyne majesty is offended. For ye child shows
not to have loved his fader that voluntaryly and wyttyngly vsrth and serves
him with the knyfe that his fader has been slain with. By the things above
said the church of the cursed folks shall be dystroyed / and the players
through the grace of god chastysed / and the sins of the play to be
confounded with the devil of hell. And the virtues and good condycyons shall
take augmentacyon and encreasynge in the people. The which thing pleases it
ye mercy of god to vttre unto us of his benygne grace and pity. Amen.

THe king saint Loys consyderyng ye euylles that follows of such manner of
plays forbode and defended throughout al his real me even so as it appears by
his constytucyons and ordeynaunces made and pronounced at paris / the year of
grace.M. two hundred and four and fifti in the month of decembre. Out of the
which constytucyons has been extracte the artycles that follows.

The first article.
We will and command that all the baylyfes of our realm / and all other
having office under them / and that receives wages of us be not so hardy to
pronounce any iniuryous word against the honor of god of the vyrgin Marye or
his saints. More over that they absteyne them from all plays of dyce and
cards / and from fornycacyon / and from frequenting of ye tauernes

The second article.
More over we defend straytly that none be so hardy to play in any manner at
the dyce and cards.

Item we will and ordeyne that al they that keeps such manner of instruments
to play / or for to make to play to be grievously punysshed. In like wise that
through all our realm it be defended to all werkemen to make such cards and
instruments.

At the beginning of the above said ordeynaunces royal is thus written. We
will and ordeyne yt all bayllyfes prouostes vycou^tes and mayres of towns and
al other constituted in offices under them be constrained and sworn that they
shall keep and make to be kept to their power the said ordeynaunces and
constytucyons. And if by adventure our bayllyfes are transgressors of the said
swerynges / we ordeyne that they be punysshed in their goods / or in their
bodies if need be reserving for all that the punycyon to ourselfe / or to some
body committed and deputed by us to do the same. But if the prouostes / mayres
/ vycou^tes and other officers under the said bayllyfes vyoleth their said
oaths we will that they be punysshed by the bayllyfe with the counsayll of the
Justice in taking witness of some good men.

The abouesayd constytucyons are written among other in a book written in
parchement being in the lybrarye of the ryall college of Navarre founded at
Paris intytled the book of customs of diverse countrees and the ordeynaunces of
saint Lowys.

Here after follows some opynyons of holy and venerable doctors upon the
matter of the dice and of the cards.

The first is of saint Bernardyn in the book that he has made of the christian
relygyon in the sermon.xlij. article.iij. cha. ij.
BY the opinion of the said saint Bernardin and of the other doctors here
after named is apperyng that they and tho that makes dyce and cards / and
they that by them and sell them synneth mortally / for they are al consenting
of the evil / and does it together / so as says the rule of droit of them
that are occasyon of the evil. Qui occasionem damni dat: damnu^ dedisse
videtur. That is for to say. He that gives occasyon of ill seems to do the
evil. And also such art ought to be defended / reason is / for it is against
the welthe of the soul / and against the vtylyte and prouffyte of the thing
publycke / and to the do^mage of the same in asmoche as it vndothe the good
universal / beholdynge the good partyculer. Ite^ it is against the right in
asmoche as it begyleth other the which thing is defended of three laws / ye
of the law of nature / of scripture and of grace / and also by ye law humayne
as it is noted in the first of the instytutes at the paragraphe Iuris precepta
sunt hec. etc.

Item says the said holy doctor in the opinion above specyfyed that all the
persons above named are perteyners of the euylles that proceeds of the said
dyce and cards / that is blasphemynges against god ^ and forswerynges /
theftes / begylynges / and other euylles and great sclaundres. And fynably the
fruit yt comes of players is but evil. And if you will know it Ihesus our
redemptour shows to know them in the.vij chapter of saint Mathewe. A
fructibus eorum cognoscetis eos. That is for to say by their fruit you shall
know them.

Item the said art and other like are defended because that sort concordeth
in them as says ye laws cyuyles and also the droit canon* And all they that
occupyeth them shall yield accountes before the judgment of the holy trynyte.
And this may be understand of the other plays of chance.

The second opinion is of master Anthony of Florence in his second party /
in the first title / in ye.xxiij. chapter / and.xiij. pa. The opinion of this
doctor is yt the said persons above named synneth mortally saying thus. To
speak of the makers of dyce and of cards and sellers of the same they sin
mortally / because that the men uses them most in synnynge mortally /
wherefore it must be said that the said personages above named may not be
excused from deedly sin seeing yt there is none that cares for the evil
end of the art / and may not be assoylled save that they leave the said arte^
as says the droyt cano / as it is noted in the party in^tytled de penitentia
distinctione.v. in the chapter. Falsas / in the chapter. Fratres. And in the
chapter. Negocium. etc.

The third opynion is of master Ange de clauasio in his sum in the title
ars / and paragraphe.ij.
Says this doctor / all they and tho yt ma^keth dyce and cards and other
curyosites by which oftentimes is in deedly sin those that occupye them /
may not be assoylled but if that they leave their craft.

The fourth opinion is of master baptyst in his sum called roselle in the
title / Negociatio.
ANd he says thus. They that make dyce and cards are not excused / for the
most often the men in playenge abuses them with ye same / and is styred unto
auaryce / and not for cause of recreacyon as one ought to do in all plays
without any malice or decepcyon.

The.v. is of master Henry Herp in the book yt he has made of the
commandments of the law upon this word. Non furtum facies.
THis venerable doctor says as the other / and also says more over. Such
folk are not excused by ygnoraunce. For they ought to know it. As diverse
knows well that such plays may not be made without abusing / reason is.
For every body ought for to know to what end the art draws that he wynneth
his living by / That is for to wit if it be honest or not / or to the
preiudyce of the common welfare / or of his neighbor or otherwise. He the
which ygnoreth this is culpable of sin as it is noted in the droit canon.
extra de iniu. et dam. da. in ye chapter. Si culpa. And it is to be noted that
every art and humayne office ought not to be excercysed but if that they be
well proved to be necessary and vtyle after reason and humayne equity to the
life of men the which thing god the creator sygnyfieth in genesis in the
third chapter saying to Adam. In sudore vultus tui vesceris pane tuo. That is
for to say In the sweet of thy body thou shalt win o Adam and shall use thy
bread. In showing us clearly yt we ought not to entende to no labor / nor to
none art save unto that the which is to the susteynynge of the life humayne
ordained and establysshed. To this purpose says Crysostome upon saint
mathewe. Eas solas oportet arts vocare que necessariorum et eorum que
continent vitam nostram sunt distributive et constructiue. That is to say. It
behooves only to call and name yt scyences and arts to be scyences by the
which we may have and win the things necessary and prouffytable to the
susteynynge of our lives corporal. Whereby if any crafty man abused with his
science as we se oftentimes / how well that by him ye science is not evil
notwithstanding it ought to be exturped and defended by the auctoryte of the
prince after the documents of Plato in his polytykes yt he has made de regime
of the common welthe.

The.vj. opinion is of master Ambrose Sphiera in his quadragesimal de floribus
sapientie in ye.xxxvj sermon / in the second party / in the third conclusyon
toward the end.
THe opinion of the said master is such. / All they that sells / byeth / or
lenneth dyce tables / cards / and other semblable instruments synneth
mortally / and are perteyners of all the crimes and euylles that yssueth by ye
rule above rehearsed. Qui occasionem. etc. Example posytyf. I demand says ye
said doctor / what evil should it be if some werkeman made / or sold / le^ned
/ or gave a knyfe to some evil body murdrer / to the end that the true
innocents and good men were killed and slain To answer truly it should be a
great evil. And by more stronger reason it is more gretter evil without
co^paryson to play at the dyce and cards / for there ye soul is wounded unto
death spyrytuell / and god is there offended and blasphemed / his glorious
mother / and ye blyssed saints of paradyse / pyteously and detestably dyspyted
and pariured / fyghtynges homycydes / and diverse outrages amongst the one and
the other. And fynably evil and right unhappy examples whereof diverse gothe
unto dampnacyon eternal without remedy. And for conclusyon the world is al full
of this abusyo^ that is cause of diverse great punycyons that god sends in
chastysynge. O unhappy and dampnable inuencyon for the which without
remyssyon diverse gothe in to hell in dampnacyon lesynge ye salute of their
souls. And this is spoken to every body as well makers as buyers / priests /
officers / and lords of lands / and generally to them that hold the
instruments of such plays. selfly they that make the things above said /
and that occupyeth them / the which may not be assoylled without doing open
penance / so as says the text. Extra de penitentus et remissionibus. in the
first chapter. And the gloss in like wise says that ye sins done openly ^
ought to be amended and chastysed openly. So says the droit canon in the
second cause / first questyon in the chapter. Si peccaueris. Be ye sins of
little blame or of great. Reason. It is for to take away the sclaundre that
might fall among diverse other. The open penance of such folk is such yt
even so as they have occupied the said craft and plays openly that right so
they bear the instruments of these cursed plays in to ye mids of ye common
place and that the officers of towns and cytes make all together too be burnt
or else they are culpable of the dampnacion By the which appears clearly by
the opynyons of ye said doctors and auctorytees above spoken that the said art
of dyce and of cards and other plays are defended and forboden. And they that
make them that selle them they that bye them they that lenne them or they that
hyreth them and they the which keeps them in their houses chambres or other
places or manoyres / knowing and wyttynge the evil end and abusyon that by
ye same follows synneth mortally. And if they do not penance and satysfaccyon
they are culpable of eternal dampnacyon.

The opynyons above said have been vysyted at Paris by.xij. venerable doctors
of the faculte of theologye the which have found the said opynyons good / and
reasonable / and says that such men is not in ye estate of grace but gothe
unto dampnacyon if they do not penance and leave that dampnable craft. And
ensygneth and techeth a reason among the other euyde^t to conferme all the
things above said / the which is such.

Also often and many times as of an operacyon / or of a craft the which one
may well forbere yssueth as many euylles or more than goodness / they ought to
be taken away and divided from ye common welthe. Now it is so y^ out of the
plays of chance and instruments for to play the which one may well forbere
yssueth innumerable euylles and fynably no goodness as the expe^ryence shows /
wherefore it is necessary for ye health of the souls / and the peace and vtylyte
of the common welfare that they be condemned and forboden with all y^
instruments that apperteyneth to such plays of chance and hasarde / as is
the dyce / cards / tables and other like or semblable.

In like wise we have asked ye opinion in this matter of four lords
counsayllers in the parlyamente of Paris / the which has answered euenso as
the doc^tours / and is of their opinion. This ought ye confessors to note well
/ and all they that have souls in gouernynge and keeping.

Uysyon horrible and meruayllous showed to my lord saint Cyrylle dyscyple of
ye glorious saint Jerome.
MI lord saint Cyrylle in a book intytled the book of the death of my lord
saint Iherome / in the.xvij. chapter of the pystyll contained in the said
book the which wrote unto saint Austyn where as he makes mencyon of ye
miracles of the glorious saint Iherome / he recyteth one amongst the other
much horrible of them y^ are given to playenge. And the said saint Cyrylle
says / I had a neuewe named Ruffus the which was given me in gouernynge
because that his fader and mother deyed when he was but a year of aege / by my
will I would that he had never issued out of ye womb of his mother to the end
that he had not suffered that the which he suffer now. I had governed him with
as great dylygence as I might. The poor unhappy waxed in aege and not in very
sapyence / he waxed also in beauty corporell and not in the beauty of the soul
in such wise that for his beauty honest bounte / and sapyence moundayne he
was honored of every body humaynly. At the aege of.xviij. year the poor
unhappy and miserable cre^ture dyed / of y^ which they that knew him were so
sorrowful in weeping and bewayllynge him yt a month after his death with great
pain were they appeased. But certainly te wepynges and lamentacyons were not
suffycyent for that which was happened him. And for as much as I had loved
him entyerly / diverse times I have made my request to ye glorious saint
Iherome yt it pleased him for to show unto me what was become of my neuewe.
And by ye merytes ot the said saint Iherome I have obtained that which I have
demanded. For one day among the other as I was in prayer at the hour of.ix.
of the clock I felt so great a stynke that I might not suffer it. And as I
thought in myself fro whens proceeded ^ so great a stynke in lyftynge up mine
eyes I saw above my heed my poor neuewe in a semblaunce and figure much
horrible / in such manner that I durst not behold him ones again / for he was
bound with great chains ardaunt full of fire / and as a furneyse cast
stynkynge flambes out. At this vysyon horrible suddenly took me such an
incomparable fere that when I would have spoken unto him I might not in no
manner. Fynably at the last a little after I began for to take spyryte to me /
and all trymblynge began for to speak in demau^dynge if it was my neuewe. And
then with great syghes and houlynges he began for to say in this wise. A mine
own will that I had never ben created upon the earth / to the end that I had
not ben delivered to the grievous pains and torments that I endure. Alas mine
uncle know that I am eternally condampned to be in the pains and prysons
perpetual of hell / there to abide and remain for ever with all ye deuylles
and cursed dampened men and women. And then when the blyssed and holy saint
Cyrylle had herd the great wepynges complaynets and lamentacyons that his
neuewe had made there before him / and considering his inestymable pains and
torments and how he was perpetually condampned in to ye pains of hell began
for to say. Halas what shall I say Certainly after that I had herd my neuewe
I have had so great doloure that diverse times I have been sore abashed yt my
soul departed not fro my body. And after yt I had spoken long to him I
demanded him why he was so grieved / and he answered yt it was because yt he
had taken dylectacyon in playnge in ye world / without confessyng it /
wherefore I am depryued from the mercy of god. And after these things he
vanysshed away leuynge such a stynke behind him yt never after none entered
therein. By this example none ought for to play / for it dyspleaseth god much
grievously. These things considered of the holy saint Gregorye he said O peto^r
mome^taneu^ e^ quoth delectat scz in hoc mu^do: eternu^ vero quoth cruciat scz in
inferno. Alas says saint gregorye poor mou^dayne all the delectacyons yt
thou takes in this miserable world in these plays dyabolyques in thy body in
clothes dyssolute and other vices it is but a momente. Eternu^ vero quoth cruciat
but ye torments of hell are eternal without end. Of the which pains the
holy man Job reherseth twain in the xxiiij. chapter of his book where as he
says. Transibunt ab aquis minu^ ad calore^ minu^. Job says that among ye
great pains yt is in hell there is two horrible and meruayllous ye one is of
fire ardau^tly bre^ning and the other is of ysy water the which two pains no
tongue can express. And therefore says saint gregory all the strengthes of
the bodies and souls of ye wretched sinners are in tho two pains before them
in augme^tynge of all their pains and torments.

Ite^ if there were a stone a thousand times more greter than all the earth /
and that there came a bird from a C.M. year. to a.C.M. year and no sooner /
and that for every time he took of the stone also great alonely as the.x. part
of a corn of whete / so yt m.x.C.M. year he had not taken but a piece also
great as a corn: and that god had made promise to a dampened yt when the said
stone should be al eten / and no sooner he should have not ye glory of paradyse
/ but releasynge of his pain. The said dampened should be already dyscharged of
one of ye gretest pains of hell. That is that he should have releace when the
stone were eten. But alas alas alas and a.M. times alas when should it be. And
for all y^ all the dampened are deuoyde of such trust / for they know well y^
that they shall never depart from thens. And this pain yt is dyspayre none can
comprehe^de. O pyteous hertes think profoundly where becomes your aege / and
your time / think where is your love and your understanding. Think whether
you are in the way of glory or in the way of torment. And ymagyne that there
is a hundred mylyons in hell that if they had half an hour of ye time yt you
have / they would make such dylygence and such penance yt they should never
return theder again. Alas who may think the great complayntes and
lamentacyons yt they make without ceasynge for the time yt they have lost /
wherein they might have won paradyse. How little has lasted our joy and
pleasaunce moundayne. Alas what has prouffyted us honors / rychesses / and
delytes / great castelles / houses / dygnytees / offices / al is passed sooner
than the wind / and there is left us but maledyccyon of god myserye and
torment. Cursed be the hour that we were ever borne of our mother / we have
lost the merit of the passion of the sauyoure / we have lost paradyse and
eternal benedyccyon. Alas god wherefore haste you created us cursed be the
creator / ye creature / and ye hour also of the creacyon. We are well cursed
and confounded we may cry long / curse / and blaspheme / one can not
conforte another / but well dysconforte O how it is an horrible thing ^ cruel
/ and to be redoubted to offend god and break his commandments / it is to
late to repent him there. Such lamentacyons and other like is in the song of
the unhappy dampened / of ye estate of whom and of their pains none can speak
nor write plainly in comparyson of that which they suffer / but this
notwithstanding who that well beholds and consydereth in his heart this that
is spoken in this little treatise / he ought to conceive fere if ever by
scripture or other manner he had any And to this purpose is found by writing
that a man excessiuely mou^dayne and full of all vanyte named Fulkes. Ones
among ye other he lay in a bed right soft and delycyous / but he might not
sleep as he desired / and anoyed him that the day came not not for to go to
the mass or do some good but for to excercyse his folyes and worldely vanytes.
And he being in such anoye thought profou^dly in himself what doloure he
should have if he were condampned for to abide there in bed by the space of
two or three years without other light or body. And conceived in himself that
for no so^me of gold nor silver he would not endure that pain and torment.
And after he thought more depely what it might be of them that were in
purgatory by the space of a hundred year in sharp fire / and what grefe they
endured in abiding the Joys of paradyse. But as god would he thought more
over on them that were dampened in hell perpe^tually in great torments /
whereof he had so great fere and dread that anon after he entered in to the
relygion of Cistersien^. where as he prouffyted so much in meditacyon and
perfeccyon thinking on ye pains of hell that he was chosen to be the bishop
of Toulouse in ye which dygnyte he fynysshed his days right holyly and went
unto the glory of paradyse. By this example appears clearly the great
prouffyte yt comes from holy medytacyon and thinking on the pains of hell and
of the long contynuynge of the same the which prouffyte declares the
prudent. Ecclesi.vij. ca. in saying. In omnibus operibus tuis memorare
no^ussima tua et ineternum non peccabis. That is to say. O poor sinner in all
thy works and operacyons have remembrance of the hour of thy death / of the
Iugementes of god of the pains of hell / and of the Joys of paradyse and
thou shalt never offend god. so be it. Amen.

This present treatye has made to be prynted two venerable doctors of the
faculte of theologye at Paris master thomas Uarnet curate of saint Nycolas of
the feldes / and master Nowell beda pryncypall of the right ruled college of
